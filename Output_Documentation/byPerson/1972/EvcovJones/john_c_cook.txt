mr.
john
c.
cook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
issues,
which
were
presented
to
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals.
the
first
issue
decided
by
the
lower
court
was
a
certain
instructional
material,
which
were
developed
and
created
by
petitioner
and
sold
as
camera-ready
copies
were
as
a
matter
of
law
tangible
personal
property.
receipts
from
sales
of
this
tangible
personal
property
to
the
united
states
and
the
research
foundation
of
the
university
of
toledo
were
decided
to
be
exempt
from
the
tax
as
it
issue
here.
mr.
john
c.
cook
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
your
honor
we
say
that
the
grounds
are
ambiguous
with
regard
to
why
the
court
of
appeals
raised
the
decision
on
the
services
tangible
issue.
mr.
john
c.
cook
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
to
governmental
bodies?
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
once
they
decided
what
was
being
sold
was
tangible
personal
property,
yes
justice.
the
second
issue
concerns
sales
to
bars
who
were
outside
new
mexico
and
the
delivery
was
outside
new
mexico.
the
subject
matter
of
those
sales
was
not
materially
different.
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
petitioner’s
receipts
from
these
sales
were
subject
to
tax.
these
sales
were
clearly
under
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
reasoning
out-shipments
of
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
john
c.
cook
were
under
out-shipments
of
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
john
c.
cook
how
did
the
court
held
that
the
petitioner’s
receipts
from
these
transactions
were
subject
to
tax
and
decided
that
these
receipts
could
be
subject
to
tax
without
doing
violence
to
the
interstate
commerce
laws
of
the
federal
constitution.
respondent
contends
that
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
decided
both
issues
how
did
the
error
with
regard
to
the
first
issue
caused
and
resolved
it
in
the
error
in
the
second
issue.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
if
i'm
might
expand
a
little
on
my
answer.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
in
the
first
opinion
that
--
the
regarding
the
issue
of
services
versus
tangibles
said
the
adoption
of
the
possession
taken
by
the
commissioner
would
result
in
an
augment
imposition
of
taxes
such
as
those
here
involved
upon
agencies
and
institutions
which
the
legislature
intended
should
be
exempt
their
file
or
result
in
a
tax
burden
being
shifted
to
other
taxable
customers
of
the
taxpayer.
neither
of
these
results
would
be
consistent
with
the
legislative
intent.
shifting
the
tax
burden
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
object
of
requiring
a
tax
burden
to
follow
with
uniformity
and
equality
upon
the
class
of
person
sought
to
be
taxed.
in
support
of
the
statement,
the
court
of
appeals
cited
another
court
of
appeals
case,
new
mexico
electric
service
company
versus
jones.
the
reasoning
that
resulted
in
the
statement
i’ve
read
seems
to
be
that
if
the
commissioner’s
decision
and
order
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
service
versus
tangible
personal
property
have
been
affirmed
by
their
court
of
appeals,
the
effect
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
taxpayers
performance
services
for
the
united
states
or
any
agency
or
instrumentality
thereof.
the
new
mexico
electric
service
company
case
which
was
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
raised
issues
under
both
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
united
states
and
the
new
mexico
constitution.
respondent
contends
that
this
reasoning
of
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
regarding
a
requirements
of
equal
protection
is
erroneous
because
the
imposition
of
the
tax
was
on
the
seller
and
there
was
no
showing
that
sellers
or
services
to
these
agencies
or
organizations
has
a
class
that
sellers
ask
class
were
treated
differently
for
purposes
of
taxation.
if
the
imposition
of
the
taxes
at
issue
here
is
on
receipts
from
the
performance
of
services
rather
than
receipts
from
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property,
the
respondent
contends
that
the
tax
is
not
repugnant
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
basis
for
part
of
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeal’s
decision
with
regard
to
that
first
issue.
there
appears
to
respondent
to
be
at
least
of
security
as
to
the
precise
grounds
for
the
judgment
in
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
issue.
although,
we
haven’t
cited
at
this
case
in
our
briefs
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
take
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
deciding
a
federal
question
when
they
or
possibly
deciding
a
federal
question.
when
they
held
that
the
sales
were
of
tangibles.
now
if
that
was
a
federal
question
which
was
decided
erroneously,
then
under
the
rules
regarding
certiorari
we
say
that
that
federal
question
can
be
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
john
c.
cook
no,
your
honor.
no,
justice.
we
want
the
decision
reversed
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
appellant
wants
the
decision
reversed,
but
he
wants
it
reversed
on
the
second
issue.
mr.
john
c.
cook
for
a
different
reason.
mr.
john
c.
cook
the
court
of
appeals
gave
us
direction
regarding
the
assessment
--
gave
the
bureau
of
revenue
direction.
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
are
to
abide
by
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
once
cases
are
presented
to
them
regarding
tax
liability.
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
can
abate
it.
we
can’t
abate
the
assessment.
the
procedure
is
abatement,
justice
and
we
can
abate
it
if
it’s
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
or
erroneous
as
to
the
figures.
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
are
saying
now,
however
the
court
of
appeals
who
decided
this
case
says
it’s
not
erroneous.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
to
reverse
on
the
ground
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
that’s
correct
justice.
in
the
case
of
state
of
minnesota
versus
national
tea
company
which
is
not
cited
in
the
respondent’s
brief
that
it’s
a
309
u.s.
551.
there
was
obscurity
in
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
in
a
tax
case
involving
the
graduated
gross
sales
tax
on
chain
stores.
this
obscurity
arose
because
of
discussion
by
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
of
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
reference
and
the
syllabus
of
that
case
to
a
provision
of
the
minnesota
constitution
which
provided
that
taxes
shall
be
uniform
upon
the
same
class
of
subjects.
in
minnesota
versus
national
tea
company,
it
was
contended
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
should
not
take
jurisdiction
because
of
the
rule
that
jurisdiction
is
not
taken
for
a
judgment
of
a
state
court
rest
on
two
grounds,
one
involving
a
federal
question
and
the
other
not.
however,
there
was
found
to
be
obscurity
as
to
the
grounds
for
the
decision
and
jurisdiction
was
taken.
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
state
court
to
resolve
ambiguities
of
the
decision.
and
the
case
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
this
court
stated
this
court
is
frequently
held
that
in
the
exercise
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction
it
has
the
power
not
only
to
correct
errors
of
law
in
the
judgment
and
the
review,
but
also
to
make
such
disposition
of
the
case
as
justice
requires.
mr.
john
c.
cook
no.
we
would
rather
have
the
decision
reversed
and
have
it
stand
as
is
it
does
not.
what
we
would
prefer
is
that
the
decisions
we
changed
as
to
the
grounds
with
regard
in
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
we
would
prefer
to
have
the
reasoning
changed
and
have
it
affirmed,
but
if
we
can’t
get
that,
we’d
prefer
to
have
it
reversed.
mr.
john
c.
cook
because
as
it
stands
now,
we
think
that
the
case
is
an
improper
construction
of
the
law.
mr.
john
c.
cook
with
regard
to
out-shipment
--
the
taxation
of
out-shipments
of
tangible
personal
property
we
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
that’s
our
argument.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
it
will
cause
difficulties
in
administration
as
the
tax
program.
the
administrator
--
the
commissioner
of
revenue
has
reviewed.
he
has
directed
counsel
to
argue
in
this
manner.
i
feel
that
the
case
is
arguable.
i
don’t
feel
that
as
counsel,
i
am
shirking
my
duty.
however,
the
position
of
the
administrator
is
the
one
that
has
client
that
we’d
hear
to.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes
justice,
we
requested
that
we
will
be
allowed
to
submit
briefs
after
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals.
they
said
no
briefs.
we
made
this
same
argument
regarding
the
federal
question
nvolving
the
equal
protection
clause
at
oral
argument
before
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
although
it’s
not
reference
in
their
second
opinion.
mr.
john
c.
cook
as
such.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
five,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
he’s
now
moved
and
he
was
the
judge
throughout
the
original
opinions.
mr.
john
c.
cook
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice
on
the
reason
why
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
denied?
mr.
john
c.
cook
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
john
c.
cook
no.
mr.
john
c.
cook
no.
we
did
at
after
the
initial
case.
after
the
remand,
we
didn’t
join
in
petition
in
new
mexico
supreme
court
for
certiorari.
mr.
john
c.
cook
i
believe
that
total
assessment
was
about
$35,000.
mr.
john
c.
cook
tax
exempt
interest.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
with
regard
to
the
question
justice
rehnquist
asked
the
statutes
of
new
mexico
have
been
amended.
section
7216
(a)
14.12
came
in
after
the
period
involving
this
assessment.
now,
that
deduction
provides
for
deduction
for
services
performed
in
new
mexico
when
an
initial
use
of
the
product
of
the
services
is
outside
new
mexico.
however,
the
buyer
outside
new
mexico
is
required
to
deliver
a
non-taxable
transaction
certificate
regarding
these
sales.
so,
if
this
matter
had
come
up
under
current
law
and
a
certificate
had
been
issued
then
the
sale
would’ve
been
deductible
from
a
gross
receipts
tax.
respondent
submits
that
there
was
error
of
law
present
in
the
decision
in
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
point.
that
error
presented
to
federal
question
on
the
ground
that
the
states
statute
was
held
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
have
been
over
that.
even
if
it
is
decided
that
in
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
did
not
completely
decide
the
first
issue
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
statutes
were
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
united
states
constitution.
the
decision
does
not
present
--
does
present
an
uncertainly
as
was
present
in
minnesota
versus
national
tea
company.
respondent
submits
that
if
ambiguity
is
present
that
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
before
the
interstate
commerce
question
is
considered.
if
the
first
issue
of
the
case
was
decided
on
incorrect
grounds
that
the
exemption
or
deduction
provisions
which
were
limited
to
receipts
from
selling
tangible
personal
property
were
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
the
issue
could
be
resolve
as
a
question
of
fact
rather
than
a
question
of
law.
there
were
facts
which
would
substantially
support
the
commissioner
of
revenue’s
decision
that
the
transactions
which
resulted
in
the
tax
were
found
the
performance
of
services
if
it’s
a
fact
question.
if
it
is
decided
that
the
first
issue
was
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
that
the
issue
was
clearly
decided
on
both
federal
grounds
and
state
grounds
then
respondent
agrees
with
petitioner
as
to
the
decision
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
second
point
which
concerns
the
application
of
the
commerce
clause
article
1
of
section
8
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
freeman
versus
hewit
and
j.d.
adams
manufacturing
company
versus
storen
hold
that
if
there
is
a
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden,
the
tax
would
be
forbidden
under
the
commerce
clause
and
that
this
would
so
even
if
apportionment
was
accomplished.
the
reason
we
think
this
is
the
rule
is
because
the
destination
state
could
imposed
a
use
or
compensating
tax
on
a
full
value
of
the
adams
when
they
came
to
rest
in
the
destination
state.
the
destination
state
could
also
impose
as
an
alternative
and
oppose
the
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
receipts
from
the
subsequent
sale
of
adams
if
the
seller
had
sufficient
contact
with
destination
study
as
was
done
in
general
motors
versus
washington.
respondents
emphasize
that
our
contention
is
that
the
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden
is
all
what
is
required
to
forbid
the
tax
on
receipts
from
an
out-shipment
of
tangible
personal
property.
this
we
think
is
clear
from
the
following
statement
and
in
j.d.
adams
case.
the
statement
reads
the
vice
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
receipts
from
interstate
sales
is
that
the
tax
includes
in
its
measure
without
apportionment
receipts
derived
from
activities
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
exemption
is
a
such
a
character
that
if
lawful
in
may
in
substance
be
laid
to
the
fullest
extent
by
states
in
which
the
goods
are
sold
as
well
as
those
in
which
they
are
manufactured.
interstate
commerce
would
thus
be
subjected
to
the
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden
on
which
interstate
--
interstate
commerce
would
then
be
subjected
to
the
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden
to
which
intrastate
commerce
is
not
exposed
and
which
the
commerce
clause
forbids.
the
adam’s
case
distinguishes
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
out-shipments
from
a
tax
on
manufacturing
measured
by
gross
receipts.
the
taxes
at
issue
here
are
clearly
not
taxes
imposed
on
the
activity
of
manufacturing.
in
this
case
there
was
no
showing
in
the
record
and
no
argument
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
another
state
taxing
or
attempting
to
tax
any
receipts
from
the
activities
incident
to
the
performance
of
the
contracts.
therefore,
this
court
said
that
evco
then
had
failed
--
the
court
of
appeals
said,
in
its
burden
of
showing
an
unconstitutional
tax
on
interstate
commerce
and
the
question
on
multiple
taxations
was
not
before
the
court.
respondent
points
out
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
if
not
almost
impossible
for
the
record
to
reflect
the
possibility
of
another
state
taxing
these
transactions
--
the
possibility
of
another
state
taxing
these
transactions.
also
with
respect
to
this,
the
following
statement
from
freeman
v.
hewit
seems
particularly
applicable.
the
immunities
implicit
in
the
commerce
clause
and
the
potential
taxing
power
of
a
state
can
hardly
be
made
to
depend
in
the
world
of
practical
affairs
on
the
shipping
incidents
of
the
varying
tax
laws
of
the
various
states
at
a
particular
moment.
i
have
no
further
argument.
mr.
john
c.
cook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
issues,
which
were
presented
to
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals.
the
first
issue
decided
by
the
lower
court
was
a
certain
instructional
material,
which
were
developed
and
created
by
petitioner
and
sold

receipts
from
sales
of
this
tangible
personal
property
to
the
united
states
and
the
research
foundation
of
the
university
of

were
decided
to
be
exempt
from
the

as
it
issue
here.
mr.
john
c.
cook
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
your
honor
we
say
that
the
grounds
are
ambiguous
with
regard
to
why
the
court
of
appeals
raised
the
decision
on
the
services
tangible
issue.
mr.
john
c.
cook
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
to
governmental
bodies?
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
once
they
decided
what
was
being
sold
was
tangible
personal
property,
yes
justice.
the
second
issue
concerns
sales
to
bars
who
were
outside
new
mexico
and
the
delivery
was
outside
new
mexico.
the
subject
matter
of
those
sales
was
not
materially
different.
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
petitioner’s
receipts
from
these
sales
were
subject
to
tax.
these
sales
were
clearly
under
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
reasoning
out-shipments
of
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
john
c.
cook
were
under
out-shipments
of
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
john
c.
cook
how
did
the
court
held
that
the
petitioner’s
receipts
from
these
transactions
were
subject
to
tax
and
decided
that
these
receipts
could
be
subject
to
tax
without
doing
violence
to
the
interstate
commerce
laws
of
the
federal
constitution.
respondent
contends
that
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
decided
both
issues
how
did
the
error
with
regard
to
the
first
issue
caused
and
resolved
it
in
the
error
in
the
second
issue.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
if
i'm
might
expand
a
little
on
my
answer.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
in
the
first
opinion
that
--
the
regarding
the
issue
of
services
versus
tangibles
said
the
adoption
of
the
possession
taken
by
the
commissioner
would
result
in
an
augment
imposition
of
taxes
such
as
those
here
involved
upon
agencies
and
institutions
which
the
legislature
intended
should
be
exempt
their
file
or
result
in
a
tax
burden
being
shifted
to
other
taxable
customers
of
the
taxpayer.
neither
of
these
results
would
be
consistent
with
the
legislative
intent.
shifting
the
tax
burden
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
object
of
requiring
a
tax
burden
to
follow
with
uniformity
and
equality
upon
the
class
of
person
sought
to
be
taxed.
in
support
of
the
statement,
the
court
of
appeals
cited
another
court
of
appeals
case,
new
mexico
electric
service
company
versus
jones.
the
reasoning
that
resulted
in
the
statement
i’ve
read
seems
to
be
that
if
the
commissioner’s
decision
and
order
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
service
versus
tangible
personal
property
have
been
affirmed
by
their
court
of
appeals,
the
effect
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
taxpayers
performance
services
for
the
united
states
or
any
agency
or
instrumentality
thereof.
the
new
mexico
electric
service
company
case
which
was
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
raised
issues
under
both
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
united
states
and
the
new
mexico
constitution.
respondent
contends
that
this
reasoning
of
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
regarding
a
requirements
of
equal
protection
is
erroneous
because
the
imposition
of
the
tax
was
on
the
seller
and
there
was
no
showing
that
sellers
or
services
to
these
agencies
or
organizations
has
a
class
that
sellers
ask
class
were
treated
differently
for
purposes
of
taxation.
if
the
imposition
of
the
taxes
at
issue
here
is
on
receipts
from
the
performance
of
services
rather
than
receipts
from
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property,
the
respondent
contends
that
the
tax
is
not
repugnant
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
basis
for
part
of
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeal’s
decision
with
regard
to
that
first
issue.
there
appears
to
respondent
to
be
at
least
of
security
as
to
the
precise
grounds
for
the
judgment
in
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
issue.
although,
we
haven’t
cited
at
this
case
in
our
briefs
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
take
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
deciding
a
federal
question
when
they
or
possibly
deciding
a
federal
question.
when
they
held
that
the
sales
were
of
tangibles.
now
if
that
was
a
federal
question
which
was
decided
erroneously,
then
under
the
rules
regarding
certiorari
we
say
that
that
federal
question
can
be
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
john
c.
cook
no,
your
honor.
no,
justice.
we
want
the
decision
reversed
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
appellant
wants
the
decision
reversed,
but
he
wants
it
reversed
on
the
second
issue.
mr.
john
c.
cook
for
a
different
reason.
mr.
john
c.
cook
the
court
of
appeals
gave
us
direction
regarding
the
assessment
--
gave
the
bureau
of
revenue
direction.
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
are
to
abide
by
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
once
cases
are
presented
to
them
regarding
tax
liability.
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
can
abate
it.
we
can’t
abate
the
assessment.
the
procedure
is
abatement,
justice
and
we
can
abate
it
if
it’s
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
or
erroneous
as
to
the
figures.
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
are
saying
now,
however
the
court
of
appeals
who
decided
this
case
says
it’s
not
erroneous.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
to
reverse
on
the
ground
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
that’s
correct
justice.
in
the
case
of
state
of
minnesota
versus
national
tea
company
which
is
not
cited
in
the
respondent’s
brief
that
it’s
a
309
u.s.
551.
there
was
obscurity
in
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
in
a
tax
case
involving
the
graduated
gross
sales
tax
on
chain
stores.
this
obscurity
arose
because
of
discussion
by
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
of
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
reference
and
the
syllabus
of
that
case
to
a
provision
of
the
minnesota
constitution
which
provided
that
taxes
shall
be
uniform
upon
the
same
class
of
subjects.
in
minnesota
versus
national
tea
company,
it
was
contended
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
should
not
take
jurisdiction
because
of
the
rule
that
jurisdiction
is
not
taken
for
a
judgment
of
a
state
court
rest
on
two
grounds,
one
involving
a
federal
question
and
the
other
not.
however,
there
was
found
to
be
obscurity
as
to
the
grounds
for
the
decision
and
jurisdiction
was
taken.
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
state
court
to
resolve
ambiguities
of
the
decision.
and
the
case
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
this
court
stated
this
court
is
frequently
held
that
in
the
exercise
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction
it
has
the
power
not
only
to
correct
errors
of
law
in
the
judgment
and
the
review,
but
also
to
make
such
disposition
of
the
case
as
justice
requires.
mr.
john
c.
cook
no.
we
would
rather
have
the
decision
reversed
and
have
it
stand
as
is
it
does
not.
what
we
would
prefer
is
that
the
decisions
we
changed
as
to
the
grounds
with
regard
in
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
we
would
prefer
to
have
the
reasoning
changed
and
have
it
affirmed,
but
if
we
can’t
get
that,
we’d
prefer
to
have
it
reversed.
mr.
john
c.
cook
because
as
it
stands
now,
we
think
that
the
case
is
an
improper
construction
of
the
law.
mr.
john
c.
cook
with
regard
to
out-shipment
--
the
taxation
of
out-shipments
of
tangible
personal
property
we
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
that’s
our
argument.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
it
will
cause
difficulties
in
administration
as
the
tax
program.
the
administrator
--
the
commissioner
of
revenue
has
reviewed.
he
has
directed
counsel
to
argue
in
this
manner.
i
feel
that
the
case
is
arguable.
i
don’t
feel
that
as
counsel,
i
am
shirking
my
duty.
however,
the
position
of
the
administrator
is
the
one
that
has
client
that
we’d
hear
to.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes
justice,
we
requested
that
we
will
be
allowed
to
submit
briefs
after
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals.
they
said
no
briefs.
we
made
this
same
argument
regarding
the
federal
question
nvolving
the
equal
protection
clause
at
oral
argument
before
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
although
it’s
not
reference
in
their
second
opinion.
mr.
john
c.
cook
as
such.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
five,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
c.
cook
he’s
now
moved
and
he
was
the
judge
throughout
the
original
opinions.
mr.
john
c.
cook
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice
on
the
reason
why
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
denied?
mr.
john
c.
cook
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
john
c.
cook
no.
mr.
john
c.
cook
no.
we
did
at
after
the
initial
case.
after
the
remand,
we
didn’t
join
in
petition
in
new
mexico
supreme
court
for
certiorari.
mr.
john
c.
cook
i
believe
that
total
assessment
was
about
$35,000.
mr.
john
c.
cook
tax
exempt
interest.
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
with
regard
to
the
question
justice
rehnquist
asked
the
statutes
of
new
mexico
have
been
amended.
section
7216
(a)
14.12
came
in
after
the
period
involving
this
assessment.
now,
that
deduction
provides
for
deduction
for
services
performed
in
new
mexico
when
an
initial
use
of
the
product
of
the
services
is
outside
new
mexico.
however,
the
buyer
outside
new
mexico
is
required
to
deliver
a
non-taxable
transaction
certificate
regarding
these
sales.
so,
if
this
matter
had
come
up
under
current
law
and
a
certificate
had
been
issued
then
the
sale
would’ve
been
deductible
from
a
gross
receipts
tax.
respondent
submits
that
there
was
error
of
law
present
in
the
decision
in
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
point.
that
error
presented
to
federal
question
on
the
ground
that
the
states
statute
was
held
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
have
been
over
that.
even
if
it
is
decided
that
in
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
did
not
completely
decide
the
first
issue
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
statutes
were
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
united
states
constitution.
the
decision
does
not
present
--
does
present
an
uncertainly
as
was
present
in
minnesota
versus
national
tea
company.
respondent
submits
that
if
ambiguity
is
present
that
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
before
the
interstate
commerce
question
is
considered.
if
the
first
issue
of
the
case
was
decided
on
incorrect
grounds
that
the
exemption
or
deduction
provisions
which
were
limited
to
receipts
from
selling
tangible
personal
property
were
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
the
issue
could
be
resolve
as
a
question
of
fact
rather
than
a
question
of
law.
there
were
facts
which
would
substantially
support
the
commissioner
of
revenue’s
decision
that
the
transactions
which
resulted
in
the
tax
were
found
the
performance
of
services
if
it’s
a
fact
question.
if
it
is
decided
that
the
first
issue
was
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
that
the
issue
was
clearly
decided
on
both
federal
grounds
and
state
grounds
then
respondent
agrees
with
petitioner
as
to
the
decision
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
second
point
which
concerns
the
application
of
the
commerce
clause
article
1
of
section
8
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
freeman
versus
hewit
and
j.d.
adams
manufacturing
company
versus
storen
hold
that
if
there
is
a
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden,
the
tax
would
be
forbidden
under
the
commerce
clause
and
that
this
would
so
even
if
apportionment
was
accomplished.
the
reason
we
think
this
is
the
rule
is
because
the
destination
state
could
imposed
a
use
or
compensating
tax
on
a
full
value
of
the
adams
when
they
came
to
rest
in
the
destination
state.
the
destination
state
could
also
impose
as
an
alternative
and
oppose
the
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
receipts
from
the
subsequent
sale
of
adams
if
the
seller
had
sufficient
contact
with
destination
study
as
was
done
in
general
motors
versus
washington.
respondents
emphasize
that
our
contention
is
that
the
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden
is
all
what
is
required
to
forbid
the
tax
on
receipts
from
an
out-shipment
of
tangible
personal
property.
this
we
think
is
clear
from
the
following
statement
and
in
j.d.
adams
case.
the
statement
reads
the
vice
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
receipts
from
interstate
sales
is
that
the
tax
includes
in
its
measure
without
apportionment
receipts
derived
from
activities
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
exemption
is
a
such
a
character
that
if
lawful
in
may
in
substance
be
laid
to
the
fullest
extent
by
states
in
which
the
goods
are
sold
as
well
as
those
in
which
they
are
manufactured.
interstate
commerce
would
thus
be
subjected
to
the
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden
on
which
interstate
--
interstate
commerce
would
then
be
subjected
to
the
risk
of
a
double
tax
burden
to
which
intrastate
commerce
is
not
exposed
and
which
the
commerce
clause
forbids.
the
adam’s
case
distinguishes
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
out-shipments
from
a
tax
on
manufacturing
measured
by
gross
receipts.
the
taxes
at
issue
here
are
clearly
not
taxes
imposed
on
the
activity
of
manufacturing.
in
this
case
there
was
no
showing
in
the
record
and
no
argument
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
another
state
taxing
or
attempting
to
tax
any
receipts
from
the
activities
incident
to
the
performance
of
the
contracts.
therefore,
this
court
said
that
evco
then
had
failed
--
the
court
of
appeals
said,
in
its
burden
of
showing
an
unconstitutional
tax
on
interstate
commerce
and
the
question
on
multiple
taxations
was
not
before
the
court.
respondent
points
out
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
if
not
almost
impossible
for
the
record
to
reflect
the
possibility
of
another
state
taxing
these
transactions
--
the
possibility
of
another
state
taxing
these
transactions.
also
with
respect
to
this,
the
following
statement
from
freeman
v.
hewit
seems
particularly
applicable.
the
immunities
implicit
in
the
commerce
clause
and
the
potential
taxing
power
of
a
state
can
hardly
be
made
to
depend
in
the
world
of
practical
affairs
on
the
shipping
incidents
of
the
varying
tax
laws
of
the
various
states
at
a
particular
moment.
i
have
no
further
argument.
