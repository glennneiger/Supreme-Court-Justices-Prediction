justice
potter
stewart
you
want
to
impose
the
tax
because
you
submit
that
you
can
constitutionally
and
lawfully
do
so
if
it
is
a
tax
on
personal
services.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
going
to
embarrass
the
administration
of
your
tax
program
and
many
other
situations,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
that
position,
do
i
understand
it
correctly
you’re
submitting
that
the
basic
issue
before
us
is
whether
or
not
this
is
personal
property
or
services
and
that
the
court
below
is
wrong
in
holding
it
was
personal
property
and
you’re
asking
us
to
hold
that
these
were
services?
justice
potter
stewart
and
having
held
that
you’re
then
saying
you’re
asking
us
to
hold
that
the
tax
imposed
on
services
was
constitutionally
valid?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
really
is
exactly
the
same
position
you
have
when
a
case
was
here
before,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
which
cause
us
to
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
[voice
overlap]?
justice
potter
stewart
as
such?
justice
potter
stewart
tell
me
mr.
cook,
just
a
matter
of
curiosity.
what
is
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
to
your
supreme
court
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
did
they
refuse
to
review
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
how
many
are
on
your
supreme
court?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
taxes
are
involved
here
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
tax
or
assessment?
justice
potter
stewart
when
--
you
are
the
petitioner
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
dreaded
the
idea
of
a
reversal?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there’s
one
judgment,
isn’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
and
only
one,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
and
your
opponent
agree
that
if
it
is
tangible
personal
property
as
the
court
has
held,
no
tax
can
be
imposed?
