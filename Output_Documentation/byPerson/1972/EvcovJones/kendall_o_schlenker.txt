mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
case
of
evco
v.
jones
is
before
the
court
the
second
time.
the
issue
is
whether
the
gross
receipts
of
evco
from
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
to
customers
outside
the
state
of
new
mexico
where
delivery
is
made
outside
the
state
of
new
mexico
are
exempt
from
the
new
mexico
emergency
school
tax
and
the
gross
receipts
tax.
new
mexico
of
course
is
a
state
which
is
not
a
heavily
industrial
state
and
as
a
result
perhaps
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
some
of
the
other
government
agencies
and
instrumentalities,
in
our
state
there
have
evolved
a
number
of
businesses
which
deal
in
scientific
and
technological
materials
of
which
evco
is
one.
now,
evco
designs
educational
programs.
its
customers
are
many
government
agencies
for
the
state
and
federal
government.
it
does
a
certain
contract
work
for
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
typical
of
the
kind
of
work
it
does,
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
designing
of
instructional
programs
for
the
ibm
corporation
up
in
endicott,
new
york
for
its
use
in
training
people
how
to
use
its
typewriters,
magnetic
tapes,
electric
typewriters,
and
other
modern
types
of
business
equipment.
the
products
which
evolved
from
this
work,
which
evco
does
consists
of
camera-ready
copies
of
books
and
training
manuals,
film
strips
for
instruction
and
audio
tapes.
now,
this
case
arises
under
two
different
new
mexico
statutes
and
for
our
purposes,
i
believe
it
can
be
considered
the
same.
the
first
one
was
the
so-called
emergency
school
tax
act
which
came
about
in
1939
and
continued
along
until
about
1961
when
we
changed
the
name
to
the
new
mexico
gross
receipts
tax.
the
practical
effect
of
those
taxes
is
the
same
and
in
each
case
an
exemption
was
contained
from
the
tax
for
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
to
government
agencies
and
instrumentalities
and
to
certain
nonprofit
corporations.
in
this
case,
in
the
lower
court’s
opinion,
typical
of
this
were
the
sales
to
the
u.s.
for
service
into
the
university
of
toledo
and
so
forth.
now,
the
first
issue
involved
in
this
case
initially
was
whether
evco
was
actually
selling
tangible
personal
property
or
whether
it
was
in
fact
selling
a
service,
which
was
not
subject
to
this
exemption.
the
new
mexico
emergency
school
tax
contained
no
provision
regarding
interstate
commerce.
the
new
mexico
gross
receipts
tax
provides
an
exemption
in
the
case
of
sales
which
were
an
interstate
commerce.
notwithstanding
this
absence
of
a
provision
in
new
mexico
emergency
school
tax,
i
don’t
believe
anyone
has
ever
contended
that
new
mexico
--
that
the
presence
of
this
provision
one
way
or
another
would
have
any
effect
since,
i
think
it’s
always
been
fairly
clear
that
if
these
sales
are
in
interstate
commerce
that
they
would
be
just
exempt
as
they
are
stated
to
be
under
the
gross
receipts
tax.
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
decided
that
evco
was
selling
tangible
personal
property
which
took
care
of
a
considerable
part
to
this
case,
that
relating
to
sales
to
the
government
and
sales
to
these
tax-exempt
institutions.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
notwithstanding
their
determination
that
tangible
personal
property
was
involved,
these
sales
where
delivery
was
made
to
ibm
for
example
in
new
york
were
not
exempt
as
being
in
interstate
commerce.
we
came
to
this
court
before
and
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
new
mexico
attorney
general’s
office
at
that
time
filed
a
brief,
which
--
in
which
it
was
stated
that
so
far
as
a
second
point
was
concerned
that
the
state
would
now
agree
that
the
sales
were
exempt
as
being
in
interstate
commerce.
they
expressed
their
dissatisfaction
with
the
determination
still
about
the
services
versus
tangible
personal
property
point.
this
court
sent
the
case
back
in
using
language
in
the
view
of
the
attorney
--
their
new
mexico
attorney
general’s
position
or
concession
that
the
case
was
being
resubmitted
for
reconsideration.
and
in
effect
what
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
we
have
reconsidered
but
we
don’t
we
change
our
mind
on
this
point
and
we
again
came
back
with
the
petition
this
time
which
was
granted.
the
state
raises
this
point
about
the
tangible
personal
property
versus
services,
but
the
state’s
position
on
the
second
point
is
that
if
this
is
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property
that
we
are
correct
in
our
position
that
these
sales
are
exempt
as
being
in
interstate
commerce.
we
rely
on
the
case
of
adams
manufacturing
company
versus
storen
in
which
the
sales
there
involved
were
so-called
out-shipments
and
which
this
court
determined
that
those
sales
were
exempt
as
being
an
interstate
commerce.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
would
say
that
if
these
had
been
determined
to
be
services
that
the
tax
could
be
imposed.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
your
honor,
we
don’t
believe
that
that
will
be
an
issue
that
the
court
will
want
to
even
to
determine.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
except
that
we
--
we're
obligated
on
several
thousand
dollars
worth
of
taxes
that
we
seem
to
be
in
complete
agreement
with
everybody
about
what
we
nevertheless
know.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
your
honor
no.
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
has
already
determined
that
these
are
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
think
that’s
what
they
say.
i
think
that’s
the
question
that
they
had
is
that
in
effect
that
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
sir
we
sure
are
going
to
do.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
no,
your
honor,
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
state
of
new
mexico
says
that’s
its
tangible
personal
property,
but
they
say
that
it
is
subject
to
the
tax
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
is
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
i
believe
we’re
in
agreement
about
the
principle
is
what
you
applied,
but
the
state
does
have
an
assessment
involving
several
thousand
dollars
and
it’s
relying
on
our
court’s
opinion
to
enforce
that
assessment.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
the?
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
so
that’s
our
problem.
i
believe
the
state
has
all
the
way
with
respect
to
all
of
these
that
they
are
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
but
they
are
saying
that
we
have
a
right
to
tax
this
notwithstanding
it
that
the
petitioner
should
apportion
the
tax
in
this
case.
now,
under
the
apportionment
idea,
we
believe
that
the
apportionment
we
are
to
make
is
between
intrastate
and
interstate
sales
and
we
believe
those
are
fairly
clear.
it
appears
however
that
the
new
mexico
court
is
concerned
about
apportionment
of
something
else.
they’re
reviewing
this
as
if
it
were
a
value
added
tax.
i
believe
i
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
right.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes.
yes,
your
honor
and
we
say
that
the
decision
of
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeal
is
incorrect
under
the
authority
of
adams
manufacturing
company
versus
storen,
and
the
subsequent
cases
that
reaffirm
that
same
position.
they
are
relying
on
the
case
of
general
motors
company
versus
washington
as
authority
for
their
decision
in
the
case
and
that
case
involved
in-state
or
in-shipments
to
the
state
of
washington.
this
court
has
drawn
these
distinctions
of
three
kinds
as
i
understand
it,
out-shipments
which
cannot
be
taxed
by
the
shipping
state,
in-shipments
which
can,
and
then
the
manufacturing
type
of
manufacturing
tax,
which
is
also
a
constitutional
tax.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
our
gross
receipt
tax
is
very
much
like
the
indian
gross
income
tax
of
1933,
which
was
the
--
which
was
involved
in
adams
and
freeman
versus
hewit,
and
international
harvester.
all
of
those
cases,
it
is
a
gross
receipts
tax.
the
commissioner
of
revenue
under
the
gross
receipt
tax
act
which
came
in
1961
did
issue
a
ruling
of
which
is
to
the
effect
that
our
sale
--
our
sales
would
be
exempt
if
in
fact
they
are
tangible
personal
property.
that
is
the
determination
that
has
been
made
that
they
are
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
your
honor
initially
the
attorney
general’s
office
took
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
follow.
the
attorney
general’s
office
changed
its
position
after
the
decision.
the
real
vice
in
that,
i
believe,
is
that
we
also
have
a
use
tax
and
i
believe
that
the
use
tax
would
be
placed
in
jeopardy
if
we
had
a
court
decision
that
we
could
impose
that
gross
receipt
tax
on
the
out-shipments,
the
use
tax
on
the
in-shipments.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
your
honor,
when
we
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
didn’t
really
know
what
we
were
going
for
except
that
we
had
a
substantial
tax
liability,
which
have
been
sustained
by
their
decision.
that
court
--
this
court
had
sent
the
case
back
for
reconsideration
and
in
effect
our
court
has
said
that
even
though
these
are
out-shipments
or
personal
property,
nevertheless
we
can
impose
the
tax.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
sir.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
except
in
the
case
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
in
the
case
where
he
said
that’s
the
sole
question
he
went
on
subsequently
in
the
same
opinion
to
consider
the
second
question.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
this
--
the
matter
of
the
taxability
once
it’s
determined
that
the
products
are
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
it’s
in
the
next
part.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
it’s
on
a11
your
honor,
where
it
begins
under
its
second
point.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
no,
that’s
in
the
first
opinion
at
page
a11.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
the
two
questions
squarely
presented.
one
on
the
tangible
personal
property
versus
service;
and
then
the
second
one
that
was
a
threshold
question
once
the
determination
was
made.
and
i
believe
that
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
is
just
saying
that
it
does
not
agree
with
the
laws
established
by
this
court.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
they
did
reaffirm
that,
but
then
they
went
on
to
say
about
the
second
point
that
the
parties
were
in
agreement
on
if
this
was
tangible
personal
property.
then,
we
can’t
see
the
distinction
that
the
u.s.
supreme
court
is
drawn
that
this
would
be
taxable
if
it
was
services
and
not
taxable
if
it
was
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor
except
that
we’ve
asked
this
time
that
the
remand
be
with
instructions
as
to
the
kind
of
relief
which
should
be
granted.
we
got
back
for
reconsideration
before
and
the
reconsideration
[voice
overlap]
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
we
are
except
that
the
--
the
state
would
like
to
raise
its
---
this
tangible
personal
property
versus
services
issue.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
we
maintain
that
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
the
facts
upon
which
we
rely
were
stipulated
in
the
stipulation
which
is
material
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
not
that
i
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
it
would
not
be
in
the
sense
that
if
the
bureau
of
revenue
follows
its
existing
regulation
that
it
would
just
not
raise
it
in
any
subsequent
case.
it
does
have
a
ruling
in
effect
which
is
in
the
court’s
opinion
at
the
beginning
on
the
bottom
of
a13.
we
believe
that
that
exactly
fits
our
situation
--
the
receipts
of
new
mexico
seller
from
sales
of
property
to
non-residents
of
new
mexico
or
deliveries
made
out
of
state
by
seller’s
vehicle,
u.s.
mail,
or
common
carrier
are
receipts
from
transactions
in
interstate
commerce
and
such
receipts
may
be
deducted
from
the
gross
receipts
of
the
seller.
that
was
in
existence
and
our
court
expressed
doubts
about
it.
they
said,
well,
if
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
then
it
wasn’t
in
effect
that
the
time
that
the
taxable
transactions
arose
here.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
your
honor,
i
wish
i
could
explain
more
about
the
case,
i
think
i
can
understand
why
it’s
confusing.
it’s
confusing
to
all
the
lawyers
involved
in
the
case
in
our
clients,
we
know
that,
it’s
a
--
i
don’t
how
could
--
there
are
no
hidden
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
twice
your
honor,
that
the
second
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
had
--
one
of
the
judges
of
the
three
stated
that
he
wanted
me
to
know
that
the
decision
had
not
been
unanimous
as
it
appeared
the
first
time.[laughter]
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
don’t
know,
i
haven’t
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
we
didn’t
get
to
come
up
last
time,
your
honor.
the
case
was
sent
back
perhaps
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor
that’s
what
we
believe
our
situation
is
today.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
actually
the
court
of
appeals
--
judge
holman
is
now
on
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
hope
so
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
about
the
relief
to
be
granted.
mr.
justice
asked
if
the
state
would
be
satisfied
with
a
reversal
sort
terrifies
us
to
think
that
maybe
the
court
is
considering
that.
we,
if
the
reversal
is
to
the
whole
the
case
we
have
been
in
according
in
number
of
times
now
about
this
liability.
we
have
asked
that
the
court
reversed
and
remand
with
direction
with
regard
to
that
second
point
which
is
the
interstate.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor
and
this
is
not
just
an
exercise
on
our
part.
we
--
a
question
was
i
asked
of
counsel
about
why
couldn’t
--
you
know
whether
we
could
settle
our
own
differences.
certainly,
we
would
have
like
to
have
done
that.
i
thought
we
have
an
opportunity
when
this
case
was
sent
back
previously.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
if
the
attorney
general
has
that
power,
they
declined
to
exercise
it
in
this
case.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
--
however,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
i
believe
that
the
action
will
be
clear
then
for
the
bureau
of
revenue
[voice
overlap].
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
if
it’s
a
reversal
on
the
whole
case,
this
because
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
exactly.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
except
we
keep
facing
this
question
about
are
the
tangible
personal
property
or
services.
we
done
it
three
times
now
although
the
court
decided
that
we
are
selling
tangible
personal
property.
it
was
reargued
and
the
court
of
appeals
again
they
held
the
same
way,
this
tangible
personal
property.
and
now
we’re
faced
with
the
argument
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
on
the
second
point,
it
is
clearly
in
violation
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
there
were
two
--
there
were
two
different
amounts
of
tax
involved.
the
tangible
personal
property,
one
as
a
good
portion
of
this
case
with
respect
to
sales
to
the
government
and
sales
to
foundations
and
others
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
and
the
second
point
of
these
are
the
impacts
sales.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes
and
that’s
the
point
we’re
seeking
relief
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes
your
honor,
that’s
exactly
it.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
case
of
evco
v.
jones
is
before
the
court
the
second
time.
the
issue
is
whether
the
gross
receipts
of
evco
from
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
to
customers
outside
the
state
of
new
mexico
where
delivery
is
made
outside
the
state
of
new
mexico
are
exempt
from
the
new
mexico
emergency
school
tax
and
the
gross
receipts
tax.
new
mexico
of
course
is
a
state
which
is
not
a
heavily
industrial
state
and
as
a
result
perhaps
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
some
of
the
other
government
agencies
and
instrumentalities,
in
our
state
there
have
evolved
a
number
of
businesses
which
deal
in
scientific
and
technological
materials
of
which
evco
is
one.
now,
evco
designs
educational
programs.
its
customers
are
many
government
agencies
for
the
state
and
federal
government.
it
does
a
certain
contract
work
for
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
typical
of
the
kind
of
work
it
does,
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
designing
of
instructional
programs
for
the
ibm
corporation
up
in
endicott,
new
york
for
its
use
in
training
people
how
to
use
its
typewriters,
magnetic
tapes,
electric
typewriters,
and
other
modern
types
of
business
equipment.
the
products
which
evolved
from
this
work,
which
evco
does
consists
of
camera-ready
copies
of
books
and
training
manuals,
film
strips
for
instruction
and
audio
tapes.
now,
this
case
arises
under
two
different
new
mexico
statutes
and
for
our
purposes,
i
believe
it
can
be
considered
the
same.
the
first
one
was
the
so-called
emergency
school
tax
act
which
came
about
in
1939
and
continued
along
until
about
1961
when
we
changed
the
name
to
the
new
mexico
gross
receipts
tax.
the
practical
effect
of
those
taxes
is
the
same
and
in
each
case
an
exemption
was
contained
from
the
tax
for
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
to
government
agencies
and
instrumentalities
and
to
certain
nonprofit
corporations.
in
this
case,
in
the
lower
court’s
opinion,
typical
of
this
were
the
sales
to
the
u.s.
for
service
into
the
university
of
toledo
and
so
forth.
now,
the
first
issue
involved
in
this
case
initially
was
whether
evco
was
actually
selling
tangible
personal
property
or
whether
it
was
in
fact
selling
a
service,
which
was
not
subject
to
this
exemption.
the
new
mexico
emergency
school
tax
contained
no
provision
regarding
interstate
commerce.
the
new
mexico
gross
receipts
tax
provides
an
exemption
in
the
case
of
sales
which
were
an
interstate
commerce.
notwithstanding
this
absence
of
a
provision
in
new
mexico
emergency
school
tax,
i
don’t
believe
anyone
has
ever
contended
that
new
mexico
--
that
the
presence
of
this
provision
one
way
or
another
would
have
any
effect
since,
i
think
it’s
always
been
fairly
clear
that
if
these
sales
are
in
interstate
commerce
that
they
would
be
just
exempt
as
they
are
stated
to
be
under
the
gross
receipts
tax.
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
decided
that
evco
was
selling
tangible
personal
property
which
took
care
of
a
considerable
part
to
this
case,
that
relating
to
sales
to
the
government
and
sales
to
these
tax-exempt
institutions.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
notwithstanding
their
determination
that
tangible
personal
property
was
involved,
these
sales
where
delivery
was
made
to
ibm
for
example
in
new
york
were
not
exempt
as
being
in
interstate
commerce.
we
came
to
this
court
before
and
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
new
mexico
attorney
general’s
office
at
that
time
filed
a
brief,
which
--
in
which
it
was
stated
that
so
far
as
a
second
point
was
concerned
that
the
state
would
now
agree
that
the
sales
were
exempt
as
being
in
interstate
commerce.
they
expressed
their
dissatisfaction
with
the
determination
still
about
the
services
versus
tangible
personal
property
point.
this
court
sent
the
case
back
in
using
language
in
the
view
of
the
attorney
--
their
new
mexico
attorney
general’s
position
or
concession
that
the
case
was
being
resubmitted
for
reconsideration.
and
in
effect
what
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
we
have
reconsidered
but
we
don’t
we
change
our
mind
on
this
point
and
we
again
came
back
with
the
petition
this
time
which
was
granted.
the
state
raises
this
point
about
the
tangible
personal
property
versus
services,
but
the
state’s
position
on
the
second
point
is
that
if
this
is
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property
that
we
are
correct
in
our
position
that
these
sales
are
exempt
as
being
in
interstate
commerce.
we
rely
on
the
case
of
adams
manufacturing
company
versus
storen
in
which
the
sales
there
involved
were
so-called
out-shipments
and
which
this
court
determined
that
those
sales
were
exempt
as
being
an
interstate
commerce.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
would
say
that
if
these
had
been
determined
to
be
services
that
the
tax
could
be
imposed.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
your
honor,
we
don’t
believe
that
that
will
be
an
issue
that
the
court
will
want
to
even
to
determine.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
except
that
we
--
we're
obligated
on
several
thousand
dollars
worth
of
taxes
that
we
seem
to
be
in
complete
agreement
with
everybody
about
what
we
nevertheless
know.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
your
honor
no.
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
has
already
determined
that
these
are
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
think
that’s
what
they
say.
i
think
that’s
the
question
that
they
had
is
that
in
effect
that
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
sir
we
sure
are
going
to
do.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
no,
your
honor,
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
state
of
new
mexico
says
that’s
its
tangible
personal
property,
but
they
say
that
it
is
subject
to
the
tax
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
is
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
i
believe
we’re
in
agreement
about
the
principle
is
what
you
applied,
but
the
state
does
have
an
assessment
involving
several
thousand
dollars
and
it’s
relying
on
our
court’s
opinion
to
enforce
that
assessment.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
the?
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
so
that’s
our
problem.
i
believe
the
state
has
all
the
way
with
respect
to
all
of
these
that
they
are
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
but
they
are
saying
that
we
have
a
right
to
tax
this
notwithstanding
it
that
the
petitioner
should
apportion
the
tax
in
this
case.
now,
under
the
apportionment
idea,
we
believe
that
the
apportionment
we
are
to
make
is
between
intrastate
and
interstate
sales
and
we
believe
those
are
fairly
clear.
it
appears
however
that
the
new
mexico
court
is
concerned
about
apportionment
of
something
else.
they’re
reviewing
this
as
if
it
were
a
value
added
tax.
i
believe
i
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
right.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes.
yes,
your
honor
and
we
say
that
the
decision
of
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeal
is
incorrect
under
the
authority
of
adams
manufacturing
company
versus
storen,
and
the
subsequent
cases
that
reaffirm
that
same
position.
they
are
relying
on
the
case
of
general
motors
company
versus
washington
as
authority
for
their
decision
in
the
case
and
that
case
involved
in-state
or
in-shipments
to
the
state
of
washington.
this
court
has
drawn
these
distinctions
of
three
kinds
as
i
understand
it,
out-shipments
which
cannot
be
taxed
by
the
shipping
state,
in-shipments
which
can,
and
then
the
manufacturing
type
of
manufacturing
tax,
which
is
also
a
constitutional
tax.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
our
gross
receipt
tax
is
very
much
like
the
indian
gross
income
tax
of
1933,
which
was
the
--
which
was
involved
in
adams
and
freeman
versus
hewit,
and
international
harvester.
all
of
those
cases,
it
is
a
gross
receipts
tax.
the
commissioner
of
revenue
under
the
gross
receipt
tax
act
which
came
in
1961
did
issue
a
ruling
of
which
is
to
the
effect
that
our
sale
--
our
sales
would
be
exempt
if
in
fact
they
are
tangible
personal
property.
that
is
the
determination
that
has
been
made
that
they
are
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
your
honor
initially
the
attorney
general’s
office
took
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
follow.
the
attorney
general’s
office
changed
its
position
after
the
decision.
the
real
vice
in
that,
i
believe,
is
that
we
also
have
a
use
tax
and
i
believe
that
the
use
tax
would
be
placed
in
jeopardy
if
we
had
a
court
decision
that
we
could
impose
that
gross
receipt
tax
on
the
out-shipments,
the
use
tax
on
the
in-shipments.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
your
honor,
when
we
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
didn’t
really
know
what
we
were
going
for
except
that
we
had
a
substantial
tax
liability,
which
have
been
sustained
by
their
decision.
that
court
--
this
court
had
sent
the
case
back
for
reconsideration
and
in
effect
our
court
has
said
that
even
though
these
are
out-shipments
or
personal
property,
nevertheless
we
can
impose
the
tax.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
sir.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
except
in
the
case
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
in
the
case
where
he
said
that’s
the
sole
question
he
went
on
subsequently
in
the
same
opinion
to
consider
the
second
question.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
this
--
the
matter
of
the
taxability
once
it’s
determined
that
the
products
are
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
it’s
in
the
next
part.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
it’s
on
a11
your
honor,
where
it
begins
under
its
second
point.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
no,
that’s
in
the
first
opinion
at
page
a11.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
the
two
questions
squarely
presented.
one
on
the
tangible
personal
property
versus
service;
and
then
the
second
one
that
was
a
threshold
question
once
the
determination
was
made.
and
i
believe
that
the
new
mexico
court
of
appeals
is
just
saying
that
it
does
not
agree
with
the
laws
established
by
this
court.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
they
did
reaffirm
that,
but
then
they
went
on
to
say
about
the
second
point
that
the
parties
were
in
agreement
on
if
this
was
tangible
personal
property.
then,
we
can’t
see
the
distinction
that
the
u.s.
supreme
court
is
drawn
that
this
would
be
taxable
if
it
was
services
and
not
taxable
if
it
was
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor
except
that
we’ve
asked
this
time
that
the
remand
be
with
instructions
as
to
the
kind
of
relief
which
should
be
granted.
we
got
back
for
reconsideration
before
and
the
reconsideration
[voice
overlap]
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
we
are
except
that
the
--
the
state
would
like
to
raise
its
---
this
tangible
personal
property
versus
services
issue.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
we
maintain
that
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
the
facts
upon
which
we
rely
were
stipulated
in
the
stipulation
which
is
material
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
not
that
i
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
it
would
not
be
in
the
sense
that
if
the
bureau
of
revenue
follows
its
existing
regulation
that
it
would
just
not
raise
it
in
any
subsequent
case.
it
does
have
a
ruling
in
effect
which
is
in
the
court’s
opinion
at
the
beginning
on
the
bottom
of
a13.
we
believe
that
that
exactly
fits
our
situation
--
the
receipts
of
new
mexico
seller
from
sales
of
property
to
non-residents
of
new
mexico
or
deliveries
made
out
of
state
by
seller’s
vehicle,
u.s.
mail,
or
common
carrier
are
receipts
from
transactions
in
interstate
commerce
and
such
receipts
may
be
deducted
from
the
gross
receipts
of
the
seller.
that
was
in
existence
and
our
court
expressed
doubts
about
it.
they
said,
well,
if
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
then
it
wasn’t
in
effect
that
the
time
that
the
taxable
transactions
arose
here.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
your
honor,
i
wish
i
could
explain
more
about
the
case,
i
think
i
can
understand
why
it’s
confusing.
it’s
confusing
to
all
the
lawyers
involved
in
the
case
in
our
clients,
we
know
that,
it’s
a
--
i
don’t
how
could
--
there
are
no
hidden
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
twice
your
honor,
that
the
second
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
had
--
one
of
the
judges
of
the
three
stated
that
he
wanted
me
to
know
that
the
decision
had
not
been
unanimous
as
it
appeared
the
first
time.[laughter]
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
don’t
know,
i
haven’t
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
we
didn’t
get
to
come
up
last
time,
your
honor.
the
case
was
sent
back
perhaps
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor
that’s
what
we
believe
our
situation
is
today.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
actually
the
court
of
appeals
--
judge
holman
is
now
on
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
i
hope
so
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
about
the
relief
to
be
granted.
mr.
justice
asked
if
the
state
would
be
satisfied
with
a
reversal
sort
terrifies
us
to
think
that
maybe
the
court
is
considering
that.
we,
if
the
reversal
is
to
the
whole
the
case
we
have
been
in
according
in
number
of
times
now
about
this
liability.
we
have
asked
that
the
court
reversed
and
remand
with
direction
with
regard
to
that
second
point
which
is
the
interstate.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor
and
this
is
not
just
an
exercise
on
our
part.
we
--
a
question
was
i
asked
of
counsel
about
why
couldn’t
--
you
know
whether
we
could
settle
our
own
differences.
certainly,
we
would
have
like
to
have
done
that.
i
thought
we
have
an
opportunity
when
this
case
was
sent
back
previously.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
if
the
attorney
general
has
that
power,
they
declined
to
exercise
it
in
this
case.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
--
however,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
i
believe
that
the
action
will
be
clear
then
for
the
bureau
of
revenue
[voice
overlap].
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
well,
if
it’s
a
reversal
on
the
whole
case,
this
because
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
exactly.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
except
we
keep
facing
this
question
about
are
the
tangible
personal
property
or
services.
we
done
it
three
times
now
although
the
court
decided
that
we
are
selling
tangible
personal
property.
it
was
reargued
and
the
court
of
appeals
again
they
held
the
same
way,
this
tangible
personal
property.
and
now
we’re
faced
with
the
argument
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
on
the
second
point,
it
is
clearly
in
violation
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
there
were
two
--
there
were
two
different
amounts
of
tax
involved.
the
tangible
personal
property,
one
as
a
good
portion
of
this
case
with
respect
to
sales
to
the
government
and
sales
to
foundations
and
others
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes,
and
the
second
point
of
these
are
the
impacts
sales.
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes
and
that’s
the
point
we’re
seeking
relief
--
mr.
kendall
o.
schlenker
yes
your
honor,
that’s
exactly
it.
