unknown
speaker
and
you
both
agree
that
if
its
tangible
personal
property,
the
tax
cannot
be
imposed
and
if
its
services,
the
tax
can
be
imposed?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question,
can
we
go
behind
the
new
mexico
courts
characterization
of
its
state
tax?
it
seems
to
disagree
with
this
revenue
commissioner?
unknown
speaker
i
share
justice
stewart’s
confusion,
i
get
the
impression
here
that
your
side
and
opposing
side
to
have
a
common
enemy
in
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
groping
for
the
controversy
between
you
and
your
friend
here.
unknown
speaker
it
said
two
quite
different
things
in
its
two
opinions
and
they
happen
to
be
by
the
same
judge,
judge
holman?
unknown
speaker
on
page
a9,
this
is
its
first
opinion.
he
said,
“the
sole
question
is
therefore
whether
or
not
the
contracts
constituted
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
within
the
contemplation
of
the
statutes
or
were
contracts
for
the
performance
of
services.”
and
so
he
said
that’s
the
sole
question
for
him
to
decide
and
then
the
case
came
up
here
and
it
was
remanded.
and
on
remand
on
page
a31,
same
judge
for
the
same
court
says,
“we
failed
to
understand
how
a
tax
on
this
aspect
of
interstate
commerce
can
be
constitutionally
fair
and
valid
if
the
--
it
arise
out
of
a
contract
for
services,
but
constitutionally
unfair
and
invalid
when
the
same
instances
are
incidents
arise
out
of
a
contract
of
sale.
in
our
opinion,
taxable
incidents
are
equally
apparent
and
ascertain
it
involve
with
equal
lead
whether
they
arise
out
of
the
contract
of
sale
or
out
of
a
contract
for
services.
so,
the
first
time
around
he
said
that
the
sole
question
was
whether
they
were
tangible
personal
property
or
services;
and
the
second
time
around
he
said
it
didn’t
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
part
of
the
problem
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
it’s
part
of
my
problem
in
reading
this.
unknown
speaker
which
was
the
second
question?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
--
this
opinion?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
as
i
suggested
in
my
questions
that
the
only
difference
between
you
and
your
adversary
here
in
this
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
the
opinion
that
accompanied
the
judgment
that
was
vacated
and
set
aside,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
didn’t
think
so.
i
thought
the
--
i
say
that’s
the
--
that’s
the
one
before
us
now?
unknown
speaker
may
i
follow
up
on
this
question
that
you’ve
been
discussing.
look
at
appendix
a8
which
is
the
first
opinion
on
the
new
mexico
court.
the
first
full
paragraph
starts
it
by
saying
“he
taxpayer
contends
that
these
contracts
constituted
sales
of
tangible
personal
property”
and
then
on
the
last
sentence
the
court
says,
“we
agree
with
the
position
of
the
taxpayer.”
unknown
speaker
now,
i
can
construe
that
as
a
finding
and
a
holding
by
the
new
mexico
court
that
it
construes
these
sales
to
be
of
tangible
personal
property
under
your
statute.
now,
in
its
second
opinion,
after
the
remand
although
it
did
say
as
you
and
justice
stewart
have
pointed
out
that
it
doesn’t
see
any
legal
consequence
following
what
would
be
different
if
it
construed
the
sales
to
be
of
services
nevertheless,
it
concludes
by
saying
we
reinstate
and
reaffirm
the
first
opinion.
now,
i
have
construed
that
until
this
argument
that
that
was
reaffirmation
of
a
prior
holding
that
the
sales
were
of
tangible
personal
property.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
accept
the
position
of
your
court
that
this
is
tangible
personal
property
then
you
are
both
in
agreement
that
that’s
the
end
of
this
case
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren’t
you
really
asking
us
to
say
that
now
well
the
--
your
court
is
wrong.
now,
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
services
and
sales
and
where
it
sales
as
they
say
it
is
then
these
taxes
are
unconstitutional
reversed.
that’s
what
you
want
us
to
do?
unknown
speaker
i
think
they’re
both
asking
that
it
be
reversed.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
it
be
if
--
well,
maybe
it
can
perhaps
hear
him,
but
if
we
are
concluded
by
the
holding
of
your
court
that
it’s
on
tangible
personal
property
and
then
that’s
--
isn’t
that
they
framework
within
which
the
constitutional
question
should
we
decide
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schlenker,
incidentally
where
do
we
find
the
facts
in
this
case?
i
don’t
see
they
have
an
appendix.
unknown
speaker
aren’t
there
two
stipulations
in
the
file?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
is
this
argued
before
the
new
mexico
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
anything
in
the
colloquy
between
you
and
the
members
of
that
court
which
shed
light
on
this?
unknown
speaker
and
the
second
time?
unknown
speaker
and
then
back
--[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it
sent
back
on
what
was
basically
a
confession
of
error
maybe
by
the
state?
unknown
speaker
and
now
by
reinstating
the
words
of
mr.
justice
powell
read
to
you
and
reinstating
the
previous
opinion,
the
state
has
confirmed
then
repeated
the
error
and
your
adversary
as
i
read
his
brief
agrees
with
that,
isn’t
it
true
and
yet
as
you
say
continues
to
but
you
still
have
a
tax
bill
to
pay?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
is
your
common
adversary?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
your
statute,
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
by
your
statutory
law,
your
tax
law,
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn’t
your
tax
law
exempt
sales
to
governmental
bodies?
unknown
speaker
and
as
i
read
this
first
opinion
that
you
were
just
applying
your
statute
in
exempting
those.
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
say
were
not
out-shipments?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
be
sure
that
i
understand.
you
now
are
contending
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
holding
that
these
were
sales
of
tangible
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
and
you’re
further
saying
that
if
these
were
sales
of
tangible
personal
property,
the
court
was
wrong
in
holding
that
the
tax
could
validly
be
imposed?
unknown
speaker
now,
mr.
cook
how
do
we
second
guess
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
whether
these
were
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
as
applied
in
any
event?
your
court
of
appeal
said,
these
were
for
the
purposes
of
your
statute,
and
that’s
it?
that’s
modern
statutory
construction
in
the
sense
of
application
that
these
particular
materials,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
how
do
we
--
how
do
we
then,
we
agree
with
that
or
have
we
any
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
of
the
things
that
may
be
quite
right,
mr.
cook
would
i
don’t
see
however
erroneous
maybe
the
basis,
the
supporting
reasoning
for
holding
that
these
or
that
this
particular
taxpayer
was
taxed
on
tangibles.
however
erroneous
that
basis
is,
how
can
we
set
aside
that
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
although
it’s
whether
that
--
whether
the
other
if
it
is
error
has
its
roots
and
misapplication
of
the
federal
constitution
or
not
as
to
this
tax
payer
which
--
unknown
speaker
you,
you
--
do
you
want
us
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
you’re
the
appellee?
generally,
it’s
the
appellant
who
wants
the
decision
reversed.
unknown
speaker
tell
me
mr.
cook,
if
had
your
court
of
appeals
correctly
said
this
was
services
and
not
tangibles
which
is
the
position
you’re
urging
now.
unknown
speaker
then
i
take
it
this
assessment,
your
view
would
be
the
taxpayer
have
to
pay,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well
then
aren’t
you
or
should
you
really
be
here
asking
us
to
affirm
the
assessment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
they
were
wrong
in
saying
that
this
was
on
tangibles
that
clearly
it
was
on
services.
and
therefore,
you
were
entitled
to
make
the
assessment
and
to
correct
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
really
should
be
asking
us
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
assessment,
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
want
us
to
say
that
we
affirm
the
assessment
because
the
reasons
i
gave
are
wrong
and
the
right
reasons
would
be
that
this
was
on
services
and
not
on,
isn’t
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
not
really
reversal
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
and
the
tax
sustained.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
the
state
would.
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
you
prefer
to
have
it
reversed
among
the
lines
justice
marshall
has
suggested
than
to
have
it
stand
as
it
is
now?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
what
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
you
have
any
constitutional
power
to
tax
out-shipments
of
tangible
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
and
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
puts
you
in
the
position,
you
do
have
it
they
say
and
you
say
it
don’t
have
it
under
decisions
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
and
your
key
--
unknown
speaker
and
your
key
submission
i
gather
has
to
be
that
this
is
whether
it’s
on
tangible
or
on
services
is
a
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
that
none
otherwise
can
we
pass
on
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
them
sat
in
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
that
which
--
unknown
speaker
did
you
oppose
it
officially?
unknown
speaker
did
you
join
in
requesting
it?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
it
all
is
it
like
that
happen
again
in
the
future
as
far
as
evco
is
concern?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
want
to
be
--
you
want
the
state
told
that
you
can’t
collect
your
$35,000
that’s
what
you
want?
unknown
speaker
and
you
both
agree
that
if
its
tangible
personal
property,
the
tax
cannot
be
imposed
and
if
its
services,
the
tax
can
be
imposed?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question,
can
we
go
behind
the
new
mexico
courts
characterization
of
its
state
tax?
it
seems
to
disagree
with
this
revenue
commissioner?
unknown

i

stewart’s

i

unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
groping
for
the
controversy
between
you
and
your
friend
here.
unknown
speaker
it
said
two
quite
different
things
in
its
two
opinions
and
they
happen
to
be

the

isn’t

unknown
speaker
it’s
part
of
my
problem
in
reading
this.
unknown
speaker
which
was
the
second
question?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
--
this
opinion?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
as
i
suggested
in
my
questions
that
the
only
difference
between
you
and
your

here
in
this
court.
unknown

that’s

no,
i

i

that’s
the

before

may
i
be
sure
that
i
understand.
you
now
are
contending
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
holding
that
these
were
sales
of
tangible
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
and
you’re
further
saying
that
if
these
were
sales
of
tangible
personal
property,
the
court
was
wrong
in
holding
that
the
tax
could
validly
be
imposed?
unknown
speaker
now,
mr.
cook
how
do
we
second
guess
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
whether
these
were
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
as
applied
in
any
event?
your
court
of
appeal
said,
these
were
for
the
purposes
of
your
statute,
and
that’s
it?
that’s
modern
statutory
construction
in
the
sense
of
application
that
these
particular
materials,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
how
do
we
--
how
do
we
then,
we
agree
with
that
or
have
we
any
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
of
the
things
that
may
be
quite
right,
mr.
cook
would
i
don’t
see
however
erroneous
maybe
the
basis,
the
supporting
reasoning
for
holding
that
these
or
that
this
particular
taxpayer
was
taxed
on
tangibles.
however
erroneous
that
basis
is,
how
can
we
set
aside
that
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
although
it’s
whether
that
--
whether
the
other
if
it
is
error
has
its
roots
and
misapplication
of
the
federal
constitution
or
not
as
to
this
tax
payer
which
--
unknown
speaker
you,
you
--
do
you
want
us
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
you’re
the
appellee?
generally,
it’s
the
appellant
who
wants
the
decision
reversed.
unknown
speaker
tell
me
mr.
cook,
if
had
your
court
of
appeals
correctly
said
this
was
services
and
not
tangibles
which
is
the
position
you’re
urging
now.
unknown
speaker
then
i
take
it
this
assessment,
your
view
would
be
the
taxpayer
have
to
pay,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well
then
aren’t
you
or
should
you
really
be
here
asking
us
to
affirm
the
assessment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
they
were
wrong
in
saying
that
this
was
on
tangibles
that
clearly
it
was
on
services.
and
therefore,
you
were
entitled
to
make
the
assessment
and
to
correct
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
really
should
be
asking
us
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
assessment,
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
want
us
to
say
that
we
affirm
the
assessment
because
the
reasons
i
gave
are
wrong
and
the
right
reasons
would
be
that
this
was
on
services
and
not
on,
isn’t
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
not
really
reversal
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
and
the
tax
sustained.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
the
state
would.
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
you
prefer
to
have
it
reversed
among
the
lines
justice
marshall
has
suggested
than
to
have
it
stand
as
it
is
now?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
what
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
you
have
any
constitutional
power
to
tax
out-shipments
of
tangible
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
and
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
puts
you
in
the
position,
you
do
have
it
they
say
and
you
say
it
don’t
have
it
under
decisions
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
and
your
key
--
unknown
speaker
and
your
key
submission
i
gather
has
to
be
that
this
is
whether
it’s
on
tangible
or
on
services
is
a
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
that
none
otherwise
can
we
pass
on
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
them
sat
in
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
that
which
--
unknown
speaker
did
you
oppose
it
officially?
unknown
speaker
did
you
join
in
requesting
it?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
it
all
is
it
like
that
happen
again
in
the
future
as
far
as
evco
is
concern?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
want
to
be
--
you
want
the
state
told
that
you
can’t
collect
your
$35,000
that’s
what
you
want?
