mr.
robert
m.
newell
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
take
the
last
point
of
the
first
because
that
seems
to
be
the
motivating
force
behind
this
litigation.
the
fact
that
the
buena
vista
lake
is
subject
to
a
flood
servitude
is
disputed.
that
is
not
a
fact
that
this
court
can
take
for
granted.
indeed,
the
most
learned
treaties
i
ever
read
on
the
subject
was
written
by
mr.
greer
when
he
represented
the
interest
who
preceded
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
and
leasing
buena
vista
lake
which
includes
there
is
no
flood
servitude.
that’s
not
a
matter
that
this
court
can
take
for
granted.
it
can
take
for
granted
however
what’s
in
the
record.
and
in
their
brief,
it’s
just
a
footnote
but
the
court
should
note
that
this
famous
meeting
in
1969
as
indicated
on
page
28
of
the
appellant’s
reply
brief.
the
general
counsel
of
the
district
advised
the
district
it
did
not
have
the
power
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
the
request
was
not
to
put
buena
vista
lake
on
notice.
it
was
a
request
to
bring
an
action
for
an
injunction
which
will
represent
a
potential
liability
to
this
district
as
several
million
dollars
that
they
lost.
now
this
district
can
function
over
through
the
device
of
a
district
project.
it’s
important
to
understand
its
limited
capacity.
it
isn’t
the
public
district
that
can
wheel
and
deal
on
governmental
matters
anytime
it
wants
to.
it
can
only
act
so
that
device
of
a
district
project.
there
is
no
district
project
that
would
born
up
the
expenditure
of
that
much
money
and
that
general
counsel
of
the
district
advised
the
district
of
that
fact
on
that
day.
both
mr.
greer
and
i
were
present
at
the
meeting.
maybe
that
can
be
disputed
but
the
matter
of
flood
servitude
in
buena
vista
lake
is
not
something
that
involves
the
constitutional
question
in
this
court,
in
my
judgment.
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
district
that
operates
to
its
district
projects,
four
of
which
have
been
enacted
in
this
district.
that’s
the
important
election
and
then
to
enact
the
district
project
requires
the
majority
of
the
value
of
the
land
and
a
majority
of
the
landowners
voting.
and
in
our
--
in
the
appendix,
we
have
put
for
the
court,
placed
for
the
court
defendants
exhibit
r
and
s
which
are
the
ballots
for
the
election
on
project
4
which
was
a
project
to
construct
two
laterals
from
the
state
aqueduct
to
the
west
of
tulare
lake
to
the
lake
at
a
cost
$2,500,000
and
you
vote
twice,
ballot
a
and
ballot
b,
and
to
answer
justice
harlan’s
questions
to
the
prior
case,
these
are
formal
elections
conducted
by
board
of
election
judges,
secret
ballot
with
all
the
formalities
of
any
california
election.
and
the
ballots
are
twofold,
you
cast
one
for
the
number
of
votes
you
have
in
relation
to
assess
values
and
one
as
a
landowner
so
that
tomas
j.
amos
whose
land
is
assessed
at
$10
value
for
project
four
has
just
as
many
votes
on
the
second
ballot
as
does
the
j.
g.
boswell
company.
it’s
not
what
a
38,715
to
1,
its
one
to
one,
in
that
regard.
so
the
california
legislature
has
provided
adequate
protection
for
the
small
landowner.
now
that
doesn’t
answer
the
matter
of
lessees
and
residents,
we’ll
get
to
that
in
a
moment.
but
i
object
and
ask
the
court
to
examine
the
simplistic
and
syllogistic
reasoning
by
which
counsel
for
the
appellants
would
suggest
this
case
be
reversed
as
this.
(a)
in
avery
versus
midland
county,
justice
white’s
opinion,
it
stated
on
effect
that
any
time
a
state
exercises
power
to
a
local
instrumentality
of
government
and
whether
a
popular
elections,
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
applies.
(b)
the
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
is
a
governmental
entity,
whatever
that
is.
therefore,
that
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
applies
and
that’s
just
not
the
case.
in
the
one
man,
one
vote
cases,
this
court
has
decided
involving
local
elections.
the
elections
of
concerned
matters
of
interest
to
all
of
the
populist,
schools,
sewers,
police
stations,
libraries
in
kolodziejski
versus
phoenix,
matters
of
general
interest
to
the
populist,
to
the
electorate.
and
the
court
has
emphasized
that.
i
don’t
know
why
i’m
lecturing
this
court
as
a
decision
but
that
does
obtain.
and
then
secondly
there
is
a
statement
that
where
the
lien
maybe
is
only
on
land
but
in
fact
the
obligation
is
going
to
be
paid
by
all
of
the
citizens.
now
the
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
is
not
that
kind
of
an
entity.
it
is
an
entity
created
by
a
petition
of
land
owners
who
can
conduct
projects
for
the
benefit
of
the
landowners
and
they
pay
for
it
exclusively.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no,
i
would
not
think
so.
that
would
be
an
invidious
discrimination
against
landowners.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
do
not
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no,
i
think
there
is
a
--
the
preliminary
question.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
can
i
ask
the
first
question.
i
would
suggest
this
that
the
question
is,
is
it
a
satisfactory
classification
to
say
that
landowners
can
vote?
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
don’t
think
this
case
is.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
but
there
are
two
answers
of
the
question
and
let
me
put
to
the
--
the
simple
answer
is,
you
look
at
the
legislation
to
see
if
the
classification
is
reasonable
if
anybody
is
invidiously
excluded.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
it’s
a
tautology
if
you
say
that.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
that’s
right
but
i
think
there
is
a
preliminary
question
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
it’s
this.
whether
state
of
california
or
any
state
permits
a
group
of
people,
any
segment
of
the
population
to
bond
together
to
accomplish
a
purpose
that
will
concern
them
all?
does
the
federal
constitution
and
the
equal
protection
clause
reach
that
kind
of
a
determination.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
would
think
you
wouldn’t
have
the
other
landowners
joining
in
the
petition
to
form
the
district.
they’re
not
going
to
be
in
it.
this
is
the
state
of
california,
justice
white,
has
taken
this
device
to
induce
landowners
to
form
these
districts.
a
large
landowner
wouldn’t
join
in
the
petition
unless
he
could
be
in
it.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
don’t
think
it
could.
they
petitioned
to
have
their
land
formed
and
be
in
the
district.
it’s
a
fairly
complex
procedure
and
you
can
petition
have
your
land
excluded.
i
would
think
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
be
excluded
was
you
are
going
to
vote.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
i
would
assume
you
would
have
petitioned
to
be
in,
in
the
first
instance.
you
would
have
joined
with
your
neighbors
to
form
the
district.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no
but
they
bond
together
under
the
statute
to
try
to
accomplish
water
--
improving
their
water
system
but
it’s
a
voluntary
thing.
the
state
doesn’t
thrust
this
classification
on
them.
the
land
owners
choose
to
do
this.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
it’s
not
a
matter,
that’s
a
matter
of
state
law
i
think.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
that
everyone
could
be
included
but
as
a
procedure
they
have
the
land
excluded.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
actually
i
think
it’s
heard
by
others
than
the
board
of
director.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i’m
sure
that’s
true
but
i
think
it
would
be
unusual
that
some
dissident
landowner
would
be
included
in
and
certainly
was
every
other
landowner
that
they
wouldn’t
form
the
district.
i
don’t
think.
but
you
misunderstand
the
california’s
motivation
in
passing
this
law
is
to
induce
landowner,
large
landowners
to
form
this
kinds
of
districts.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no,
you
wouldn’t
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
for
example
they
had
to
condemn
the
lands
for
the
laterals
to
the
state
aqueduct.
i
mean,
they
have
certain
rights
that
are
important
in
that
regard.
but
the
district’s
function
is
limited
to
projects
that
they
are
going
to
benefit
the
people
in
the
district.
it
would
be
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
the
landowners,
yes.
that
was
a
freudian
slip.
the
landowners,
anytime
i
seen
in
the
landowners
have
drawn.
landowners
in
the
district
benefit
the
land.
it
doesn’t
engage
in
activities
that
are
of
general
concern
to
the
populous,
to
the
voting
public,
to
the
electorate,
whatever
term
you
want
to
use
for
the
public
in
a
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
the
lessees
of
course,
you’re
interested
at.
but
the
state
of
california
has
the
right
to
determine
how
much
of
a
unit
of
land
will
carry
a
vote.
and
the
relationship
of
the
lessee
to
the
land
is
contractual
with
the
lessor.
it
eased
the
negotiating
power,
he
can
get
a
proxy.
if
he
doesn’t,
he
can’t
but
that’s
for
the
state
of
california
to
determine.
there’s
nothing
invidious
about
excluding
them
because
the
state
may
conclude
in
its
wisdom
that
a
lessees
interest
is
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
while
we
thought
it
was
over
in
the
court
below.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no,
that’s
right.
but
i
think
that’s
a
matter
of
state
court
determination.
if
you
concede,
in
other
words,
when
you
say
a
lessee
should
be
able
to
vote,
you
are
conceding
the
validity
of
landowner
voting
and
if
that
concession
is
made,
i
think
it’s
up
to
the
state
legislature
if
it
exercise
a
sound
discretion,
and
say
we’ll
know
we’ll
tie
a
vote
to
$100
of
assessed
valuation
of
land.
however,
that
land
may
be
divided
up
between
different
people.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
the
challenge
is,
that
lessees
and
residents,
nonlandowning
residents
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes,
lessees
and
residents,
nonlandowning
residents,
qualified
voters
who
reside
in
the
district.
now
let’s
talk
about
that.
there
are
77
people
that
live
in
this
district,
men,
women
and
children.
maybe,
i
don’t
know
how
many
of
them
if
they
are
citizens.
we
know
lawrence
allison
is
registered
to
vote.
he
is
the
only
one,
the
plaintiff,
lawrence
allison
but
as
a
matter
of
record
as
a
registered
voter.
in
the
appendix,
there
is
a
list
where
this
people
live.
66
of
them
are
employed
by
one
corporate
farm,
west
lake
farms.
you
got
11
people
spread
it
over
and
what
you
might
say,
well
165,000
acres.
i
mean
having
the
residence
vote
is
if
it
will
accomplish
nothing.
unless,
you
are
going
to
tell
the
j.
g.
boswell
company,
“well
now
look,
don’t
worry,
we’ll
let
this
fellow
up
here
in
the
corner
cast
a
vote
as
much
as
yours
and
they
can
cost
you
$817,000.”
well,
that’s
the
democratic
way.
it
doesn’t
make
sense.
if
you
are
going
to
accomplish
the
objective
that
the
california
legislature
has
in
mind
and
i
think
i
can
emphasize
that
too
much
that
the
legislature
wants
to
encourage
this
type
of
arrangement
to
finance
water
improvements
and
it’s
done
it.
it’s
done
successfully
in
tulare
lake
basin
but
they’ve
only
have
four
projects
in
its
whole
history
which
is
50
years
now.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
it
--
it
have
to
be
--
the
individuals
will
just
have
to
agree
to
do
it
as
a
matter
of
private
contract
but
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
improvement
of
the
availability
of
water
for
irrigation
purposes
in
california
and
has
used
lots
of
devices
to
do
this.
now,
this
is
one
way
of
encouraging
people
to
bond
together
to
take
certain
steps
for
this
type
of
thing.
the
concept
storage
by
way
of
explanation,
the
water
storage
district
act
was
really
passed
for
tulare
lake
in
the
first
instance
and
the
original
project
one
which
is
in
the
appendix
was
to
–
part
of
it
was
to
acquire
18
sections
of
land
and
store
this
water
that
routinely
flooded.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no.
well,
in
part,
there
was
also
--
that
that
would
create
a
reservoir.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
for
the
water
to
be
used
on
the
land.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well
there’s
nobody
there
but
landowners,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
but
66
of
them
live
on
the
high
ground
to
the
west.
they
don’t
get
flooded.
11
of
them
live
down
the
bottom
and
they
get
out.
they
all
live
in
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
i
repeat
there
are
no
people
like
that
in
the
district.
the
11
people
who
are
--
not
the
66
are
all
employed
by
corporate
farms
and
live
in
corporate-own
houses.
those
corporations
on
a
calculated
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well
the
floods
aren’t
quite
as
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
this
is
not
like
the
johnson
flood.
these
floods
are
as
mr.
greer
indicated.
they
know
when
they
are
going
to
happen.
usually
the
levees
are
cut
rationally.
cut
in
a
certain
given
areas
flooded
and
it
takes
a
15-foot
wall
of
water
doesn’t
come
dashing
down
the
side
like
it
starts
and
spreads
gradually
and
builds
up.
but
usually
the
levees
are
cut.
now,
it
gets
competitive.
at
the
picture
you
will
notice,
plaintiffs
--
i
mean
defendants
exhibit
r
and
s
and
the
appendix
shows
the
88,000
acres
of
flood.
exhibit
q,
pardon
me.
and
you’ll
notice
there’s
a
sharp
line
on
the
east
and
the
west.
well
on
north
and
south
levee
held.
the
el
rico
levee
held
in
part
to
the
east
and
if
either
--
if
there
were
going
to
be
more
flooding,
the
people
that
are
east
of
el
rico
levee
would
hope
that
it
held
and
that
the
other
one
went.
but
there
are
no
people
involved
really
in
this
type
of
flood
activity.
it’s
dramatic
but
it
just
doesn’t
exist
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it’s
mainly
a
district
designed
for
this
development
of
water
sources
but
which
is
a
--
which
is
amounted
to
really
three
things.
the
project
one
was
aborted.
they
didn’t
buy
the
18
sections,
depression
came,
there
was
a
lot
of
dry
years
so
it
just
went
by
the
board.
the
next
projects
involved
buying
storage
space
behind
the
reservoir
on
the
flood
control
dams
build
after
the
lower
and
another
one
involved
participating
in
flood
control
concerned
with
those
dams
and
then
there
is
project
four
to
get
the
laterals
to
the
district.
but
the
point
--
i
think
the
best
analogy
would
be
if
you
took
the
analogy
of
the
school
district
case
where
the
school
was
built
solely
for
the
use
of
the
landowners.
no
one
else
could
use
it.
and
they
used
it
and
paid
for
in
proportion
to
their
land.
i
--
it
occurred
to
me
in
reading
that
decision
that
the
court
might
have
reached
the
different
conclusion
were
those
the
facts,
which
is
the
fact
in
a
water
storage
district.
i
repeat
that
when
the
state
takes
a
group
of
people
and
says
now
you
may
voluntarily
bond
together
to
accomplish
this
specific
purpose
which
the
state
legislature
deems
in
the
interest
of
that
objective
in
this
case
of
agricultural
water
development.
i
don’t
think
that
that
gets
to
a
point
where
there
is
an
equal
protection
problem.
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
classification.
it’s
imposed
by
the
state
that
gives
the
group
of
people
an
opportunity
to
do
something
much
as
you
could
form
a
private
corporation.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
think
that
would
be
an
unrealistic
approach
by
a
governmental
--
by
the
legislature
to
solve
a
governmental
problem.
there
aren’t
enough
registered
voters
in
the
district
to
make
any
difference.
there
aren’t
anybody,
there’s
nobody
there.
i
mean,
you’re
not
going
to
get
people
bonding
together
to
form
a
cooperative
venture
if
you
have
registered
voters
vote.
there
aren’t
enough,
five
or
six
people?
you
take
it
you
have
each
landowner
cast
one
ballot
and
you
do
away
with
the
weighted
ballot.
as
the
appendix
points
out,
there
was
an
oil
venture
some
years
ago
and
what’s
called
the
homeland
district
which
is
the
southeastern
quadrant
of
the
basin
storage
district
and
they
saw
a
lot
of
participating
interest
in
an
oil
well
and
they’ve
got
small
acre
which
is
there.
two
acres,
ten
acres
only
from
an
oil
speculating
deal,
that
group
of
people
if
you
have
one
vote
per
landowner
would
effectively
control
the
election.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
you
mean,
if
landowners
could
vote
one
for
one,
you
wouldn’t
have
had
the
district
formed.
the
large
landowners
would
not
join
in
that.
they
wouldn’t
participate.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
see
it’s
hypothetical
in
this
instance
but
the
california
state
legislature
protected
them
from
that,
might
arranging
this
very
rational
scheme.
they
didn’t
place
that
power
and
in
the
handful
of
small
landowners.
in
other
words,
we
stand
here
stating
frankly
take
a
look
at
project
four.
the
question
is
posed
in
the
brief.
they
talked
about
thomas
j.
amos.
he
only
got
one
vote
on
ballot
a.
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
got
something
over
38,000
votes
on
ballot
a
on
project
four.
both
thomas
j.
amos
and
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
had
one
vote
on
ballot
b.
they
give
the
small
landowner
that
negative
protection
but
the
assessment
of
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
will
pay
it
for
project
four
as
$817,000
and
thomas
j.
amos
paid
$3.32.
i
mean,
we
are
dealing
with
a
practical
situation
where
the
statutory
scheme
is
designed
to
encourage
landowners
to
expand
substantial
sums
of
money
to
improve
their
water
rights.
their
water
for
agricultural
purposes
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it’s
obvious
as
an
original
proposition
that
the
state
legislature
could
encourage
this
type
of
participation
only
with
unlike
little
scheme
such
as
the
type
they
have
here.
it’s
a
limited
purpose
district.
it
doesn’t
affect
the
public.
it
affects
these
landowners
and
that’s
all
and
the
fact
that
someone
might
be
a
resident
out
there
or
an
employee
has
very
little
to
do
with
his
participation
in
these
complex
projects.
all
of
this
has
been
stated
before
and
unless
there
is
question,
i
have
no
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
think
so.
i
think
it
could
be
analogized
also
to
a
private
corporation
in
terms
of
voting
responsibility.
it’s
like
that.
these
people
paid
for
all
themselves
for
the
devices
that
are
limited.
they
alone
used
this.
i
again
repeat,
if
suppose
only
this
segment
of
the
population
used
the
school,
a
school
would
it
be
constitutional
to
limit
voting
on
that
particular
device.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes,
so
does
a
privately
owned
public
utility
in
california
justice
marshall.
that’s
not
any
great
indicia
status.
it
does
have
eminent
domain
but
it
cannot
exercise
that
right
of
eminent
domain
except
to
the
implementing
power
of
the
district
project.
the
directors,
the
failure
to
have
routine
elections
of
which
are
just
a
matter
of
some
comment
here
exercise
no
significant
governmental
power.
they
can’t
do
anything.
now,
there
should
have
been
election
in
1969
but
as
the
transcript
shows,
the
appendix
shows,
three
of
the
deviations
were
wholly
flooded,
100%
flooded.
one
was
56%
under
water
and
one
was
28%
under
water
and
i
can
assure
the
court
at
this
perilous
time,
these
people
were
not
interested
in
the
niceties
of
taking
a
polling
booth
on
a
style
up
there
to
have
an
election.
they
have
a
polling
booth
in
each
precinct,
each
division.
it
couldn’t
be
too
serious.
now
there
suppose
to
be
an
election
in
1973,
there
has
been
no
petition
filed
by
anybody
seeking
one
of
these
directorships.
no
doubt
because
as
mr.
greer
has
indicated
you
don’t
have
campaigning
in
the
political
sense.
it’s
different
but
there
is
no
petition
filed
to
have
any
election
this
year
so
the
incumbent
directors
will
continue
on
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
california
statute
on
the
subject.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
they
don’t
pay
at
all.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
only
landowners,
that’s
all
and
they’re
assessed
in
accordance
with
the
benefit
conferred
by
a
project.
it
so
happened
that
the
projects
that
have
been
enacted
have
the
board
of
assessment,
i
forget
what
they
called
them,
but
the
commissioners
have
judged
that
it
applied
uniformly
throughout
the
district.
so
the
assessment
was
equal
for
each
taker
of
land.
there
were
no
differentials
but
it’s
possible
that
there
could
be
but
only
land
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes,
sir.
project
four
was
$2,500,000
and
there
it
was
determined
that
there
are
188,000
plus
acres
that
were
benefited
by
their
project
and
that
was
assessed
$13.32
per
acre
irrespective
of
the
assess
value
of
a
particular
acre.
you
have
variations
and
the
assess
value
of
acres
as
i
indicated.
but
this
particular
project
was
assessed
uniformly.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
if
that
had
been
the
case,
it
so
happens
that
the
land
in
the
district
however,
most
of
it
is
[voice
overlap]
except
land
if
for
roads
or
dikes
or
things
from
that
kind.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
that
is
correct.
there
would
be
that
and
we
assume
that
on
that
hypothesis,
the
board
of
commissioners
which
--
by
the
way
none
of
them
can
own
land
in
the
district.
they
are
appointed.
they
cannot
own
land
in
the
district
at
all
and
i
think
one
must
be
an
engineer.
i
forgot
what
the
statute
requires
but
they
would
make
that
determination
and
there’s
a
right
of
sort
of
an
appeal
on
that
where
if
there’s
a
dispute,
one
of
the
commissioners
appoints
two
outside
people
and
they
set
in
a
sort
of
a
board
of
assessment
review.
presumably,
a
fair-minded
assessment
board
would
determine
that
there
was
no
benefit
to
the
pile
of
rock
that
he
would
pay
nothing.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
right.
and
you’ll
notice
that
in
the
appendix,
we
refer
to
the
assess
or
in
the
brief
we
refer
to
the
fact
that
like
one
acre
has
got
a
$60
or
8/10
of
an
acre
is
assessed
at
$60
and
i
think
one
acre
is
assessed
at
$10.
there
are
differentials
in
the
assessment
depending
on
the
worth
of
the
land
but
that
would
be
different
for
the
project.
the
benefit
is
fixed
there
and
determined.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
take
the
last
point
of
the
first
because
that
seems
to
be
the
motivating
force
behind
this
litigation.
the
fact
that
the
buena
vista
lake
is
subject
to
a
flood
servitude
is
disputed.
that
is
not
a
fact
that
this
court
can
take
for
granted.
indeed,
the
most
learned
treaties
i
ever
read
on
the
subject
was
written
by
mr.
greer
when
he
represented
the
interest
who
preceded
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
and
leasing
buena
vista
lake
which
includes
there
is
no
flood
servitude.
that’s
not
a
matter
that
this
court
can
take
for
granted.
it
can
take
for
granted
however
what’s
in
the
record.
and
in
their
brief,
it’s
just
a
footnote
but
the
court
should
note
that
this
famous
meeting
in
1969
as
indicated
on
page
28
of
the
appellant’s
reply
brief.
the
general
counsel
of
the
district
advised
the
district
it
did
not
have
the
power
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
the
request
was
not
to
put
buena
vista
lake
on
notice.
it
was
a
request
to
bring
an
action
for
an
injunction
which
will
represent
a
potential
liability
to
this
district
as
several
million
dollars
that
they
lost.
now
this
district
can
function
over
through
the
device
of
a
district
project.
it’s
important
to
understand
its
limited
capacity.
it
isn’t
the
public
district
that
can
wheel
and
deal
on
governmental
matters
anytime
it
wants
to.
it
can
only
act
so
that
device
of
a
district
project.
there
is
no
district
project
that
would
born
up
the
expenditure
of
that
much
money
and
that
general
counsel
of
the
district
advised
the
district
of
that
fact
on
that
day.
both
mr.
greer
and
i
were
present
at
the
meeting.
maybe
that
can
be
disputed
but
the
matter
of
flood
servitude
in
buena
vista
lake
is
not
something
that
involves
the
constitutional
question
in
this
court,
in
my
judgment.
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
district
that
operates
to
its
district
projects,
four
of
which
have
been
enacted
in
this
district.
that’s
the
important
election
and
then
to
enact
the
district
project
requires
the
majority
of
the
value
of
the
land
and
a
majority
of
the
landowners
voting.
and
in
our
--
in
the
appendix,
we
have
put
for
the
court,
placed
for
the
court
defendants
exhibit
r
and
s
which
are
the
ballots
for
the
election
on
project
4
which
was
a
project
to
construct
two
laterals
from
the
state
aqueduct
to
the
west
of
tulare
lake
to
the
lake
at
a
cost
$2,500,000
and
you
vote
twice,
ballot
a
and
ballot
b,
and
to
answer
justice
harlan’s
questions
to
the
prior
case,
these
are
formal
elections
conducted
by
board
of
election
judges,
secret
ballot
with
all
the
formalities
of
any
california
election.
and
the
ballots
are
twofold,
you
cast
one
for
the
number
of
votes
you
have
in
relation
to
assess
values
and
one
as
a
landowner
so
that
tomas
j.
amos
whose
land
is
assessed
at
$10
value
for
project
four
has
just
as
many
votes
on
the
second
ballot
as
does
the
j.
g.
boswell
company.
it’s
not
what
a
38,715
to
1,
its
one
to
one,
in
that
regard.
so
the
california
legislature
has
provided
adequate
protection
for
the
small
landowner.
now
that
doesn’t
answer
the
matter
of
lessees
and
residents,
we’ll
get
to
that
in
a
moment.
but
i
object
and
ask
the
court
to
examine
the
simplistic
and
syllogistic
reasoning
by
which
counsel
for
the
appellants
would
suggest
this
case
be
reversed
as
this.
(a)
in
avery
versus
midland
county,
justice
white’s
opinion,
it
stated
on
effect
that
any
time
a
state
exercises
power
to
a
local
instrumentality
of
government
and
whether
a
popular
elections,
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
applies.
(b)
the
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
is
a
governmental
entity,
whatever
that
is.
therefore,
that
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
applies
and
that’s
just
not
the
case.
in
the
one
man,
one
vote
cases,
this
court
has
decided
involving
local
elections.
the
elections
of
concerned
matters
of
interest
to
all
of
the
populist,
schools,
sewers,
police
stations,
libraries
in
kolodziejski
versus
phoenix,
matters
of
general
interest
to
the
populist,
to
the
electorate.
and
the
court
has
emphasized
that.
i
don’t
know
why
i’m
lecturing
this
court
as
a
decision
but
that
does
obtain.
and
then
secondly
there
is
a
statement
that
where
the
lien
maybe
is
only
on
land
but
in
fact
the
obligation
is
going
to
be
paid
by
all
of
the
citizens.
now
the
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
is
not
that
kind
of
an
entity.
it
is
an
entity
created
by
a
petition
of
land
owners
who
can
conduct
projects
for
the
benefit
of
the
landowners
and
they
pay
for
it
exclusively.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no,
i
would
not
think
so.
that
would
be
an
invidious
discrimination
against
landowners.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
do
not
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no,
i
think
there
is
a
--
the
preliminary
question.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
can
i
ask
the
first
question.
i
would
suggest
this
that
the
question
is,
is
it
a
satisfactory
classification
to
say
that
landowners
can
vote?
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
don’t
think
this
case
is.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
but
there
are
two
answers
of
the
question
and
let
me
put
to
the
--
the
simple
answer
is,
you
look
at
the
legislation
to
see
if
the
classification
is
reasonable
if
anybody
is
invidiously
excluded.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
it’s
a
tautology
if
you
say
that.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
that’s
right
but
i
think
there
is
a
preliminary
question
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
it’s
this.
whether
state
of
california
or
any
state
permits
a
group
of
people,
any
segment
of
the
population
to
bond
together
to
accomplish
a
purpose
that
will
concern
them
all?
does
the
federal
constitution
and
the
equal
protection
clause
reach
that
kind
of
a
determination.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
would
think
you
wouldn’t
have
the
other
landowners
joining
in
the
petition
to
form
the
district.
they’re
not
going
to
be
in
it.
this
is
the
state
of
california,
justice
white,
has
taken
this
device
to
induce
landowners
to
form
these
districts.
a
large
landowner
wouldn’t
join
in
the
petition
unless
he
could
be
in
it.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
don’t
think
it
could.
they
petitioned
to
have
their
land
formed
and
be
in
the
district.
it’s
a
fairly
complex
procedure
and
you
can
petition
have
your
land
excluded.
i
would
think
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
be
excluded
was
you
are
going
to
vote.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
i
would
assume
you
would
have
petitioned
to
be
in,
in
the
first
instance.
you
would
have
joined
with
your
neighbors
to
form
the
district.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no
but
they
bond
together
under
the
statute
to
try
to
accomplish
water
--
improving
their
water
system
but
it’s
a
voluntary
thing.
the
state
doesn’t
thrust
this
classification
on
them.
the
land
owners
choose
to
do
this.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
it’s
not
a
matter,
that’s
a
matter
of
state
law
i
think.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
that
everyone
could
be
included
but
as
a
procedure
they
have
the
land
excluded.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
actually
i
think
it’s
heard
by
others
than
the
board
of
director.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i’m
sure
that’s
true
but
i
think
it
would
be
unusual
that
some
dissident
landowner
would
be
included
in
and
certainly
was
every
other
landowner
that
they
wouldn’t
form
the
district.
i
don’t
think.
but
you
misunderstand
the
california’s
motivation
in
passing
this
law
is
to
induce
landowner,
large
landowners
to
form
this
kinds
of
districts.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no,
you
wouldn’t
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
for
example
they
had
to
condemn
the
lands
for
the
laterals
to
the
state
aqueduct.
i
mean,
they
have
certain
rights
that
are
important
in
that
regard.
but
the
district’s
function
is
limited
to
projects
that
they
are
going
to
benefit
the
people
in
the
district.
it
would
be
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
the
landowners,
yes.
that
was
a
freudian
slip.
the
landowners,
anytime
i
seen
in
the
landowners
have
drawn.
landowners
in
the
district
benefit
the
land.
it
doesn’t
engage
in
activities
that
are
of
general
concern
to
the
populous,
to
the
voting
public,
to
the
electorate,
whatever
term
you
want
to
use
for
the
public
in
a
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
the
lessees
of
course,
you’re
interested
at.
but
the
state
of
california
has
the
right
to
determine
how
much
of
a
unit
of
land
will
carry
a
vote.
and
the
relationship
of
the
lessee
to
the
land
is
contractual
with
the
lessor.
it
eased
the
negotiating
power,
he
can
get
a
proxy.
if
he
doesn’t,
he
can’t
but
that’s
for
the
state
of
california
to
determine.
there’s
nothing
invidious
about
excluding
them
because
the
state
may
conclude
in
its
wisdom
that
a
lessees
interest
is
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
while
we
thought
it
was
over
in
the
court
below.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no,
that’s
right.
but
i
think
that’s
a
matter
of
state
court
determination.
if
you
concede,
in
other
words,
when
you
say
a
lessee
should
be
able
to
vote,
you
are
conceding
the
validity
of
landowner
voting
and
if
that
concession
is
made,
i
think
it’s
up
to
the
state
legislature
if
it
exercise
a
sound
discretion,
and
say
we’ll
know
we’ll
tie
a
vote
to
$100
of
assessed
valuation
of
land.
however,
that
land
may
be
divided
up
between
different
people.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
the
challenge
is,
that
lessees
and
residents,
nonlandowning
residents
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes,
lessees
and
residents,
nonlandowning
residents,
qualified
voters
who
reside
in
the
district.
now
let’s
talk
about
that.
there
are
77
people
that
live
in
this
district,
men,
women
and
children.
maybe,
i
don’t
know
how
many
of
them
if
they
are
citizens.
we
know
lawrence
allison
is
registered
to
vote.
he
is
the
only
one,
the
plaintiff,
lawrence
allison
but
as
a
matter
of
record
as
a
registered
voter.
in
the
appendix,
there
is
a
list
where
this
people
live.
66
of
them
are
employed
by
one
corporate
farm,
west
lake
farms.
you
got
11
people
spread
it
over
and
what
you
might
say,
well
165,000
acres.
i
mean
having
the
residence
vote
is
if
it
will
accomplish
nothing.
unless,
you
are
going
to
tell
the
j.
g.
boswell
company,
“well
now
look,
don’t
worry,
we’ll
let
this
fellow
up
here
in
the
corner
cast
a
vote
as
much
as
yours
and
they
can
cost
you
$817,000.”
well,
that’s
the
democratic
way.
it
doesn’t
make
sense.
if
you
are
going
to
accomplish
the
objective
that
the
california
legislature
has
in
mind
and
i
think
i
can
emphasize
that
too
much
that
the
legislature
wants
to
encourage
this
type
of
arrangement
to
finance
water
improvements
and
it’s
done
it.
it’s
done
successfully
in
tulare
lake
basin
but
they’ve
only
have
four
projects
in
its
whole
history
which
is
50
years
now.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
it
--
it
have
to
be
--
the
individuals
will
just
have
to
agree
to
do
it
as
a
matter
of
private
contract
but
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
improvement
of
the
availability
of
water
for
irrigation
purposes
in
california
and
has
used
lots
of
devices
to
do
this.
now,
this
is
one
way
of
encouraging
people
to
bond
together
to
take
certain
steps
for
this
type
of
thing.
the
concept
storage
by
way
of
explanation,
the
water
storage
district
act
was
really
passed
for
tulare
lake
in
the
first
instance
and
the
original
project
one
which
is
in
the
appendix
was
to
–
part
of
it
was
to
acquire
18
sections
of
land
and
store
this
water
that
routinely
flooded.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no.
well,
in
part,
there
was
also
--
that
that
would
create
a
reservoir.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
for
the
water
to
be
used
on
the
land.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well
there’s
nobody
there
but
landowners,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
but
66
of
them
live
on
the
high
ground
to
the
west.
they
don’t
get
flooded.
11
of
them
live
down
the
bottom
and
they
get
out.
they
all
live
in
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
i
repeat
there
are
no
people
like
that
in
the
district.
the
11
people
who
are
--
not
the
66
are
all
employed
by
corporate
farms
and
live
in
corporate-own
houses.
those
corporations
on
a
calculated
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well
the
floods
aren’t
quite
as
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
this
is
not
like
the
johnson
flood.
these
floods
are
as
mr.
greer
indicated.
they
know
when
they
are
going
to
happen.
usually
the
levees
are
cut
rationally.
cut
in
a
certain
given
areas
flooded
and
it
takes
a
15-foot
wall
of
water
doesn’t
come
dashing
down
the
side
like
it
starts
and
spreads
gradually
and
builds
up.
but
usually
the
levees
are
cut.
now,
it
gets
competitive.
at
the
picture
you
will
notice,
plaintiffs
--
i
mean
defendants
exhibit
r
and
s
and
the
appendix
shows
the
88,000
acres
of
flood.
exhibit
q,
pardon
me.
and
you’ll
notice
there’s
a
sharp
line
on
the
east
and
the
west.
well
on
north
and
south
levee
held.
the
el
rico
levee
held
in
part
to
the
east
and
if
either
--
if
there
were
going
to
be
more
flooding,
the
people
that
are
east
of
el
rico
levee
would
hope
that
it
held
and
that
the
other
one
went.
but
there
are
no
people
involved
really
in
this
type
of
flood
activity.
it’s
dramatic
but
it
just
doesn’t
exist
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it’s
mainly
a
district
designed
for
this
development
of
water
sources
but
which
is
a
--
which
is
amounted
to
really
three
things.
the
project
one
was
aborted.
they
didn’t
buy
the
18
sections,
depression
came,
there
was
a
lot
of
dry
years
so
it
just
went
by
the
board.
the
next
projects
involved
buying
storage
space
behind
the
reservoir
on
the
flood
control
dams
build
after
the
lower
and
another
one
involved
participating
in
flood
control
concerned
with
those
dams
and
then
there
is
project
four
to
get
the
laterals
to
the
district.
but
the
point
--
i
think
the
best
analogy
would
be
if
you
took
the
analogy
of
the
school
district
case
where
the
school
was
built
solely
for
the
use
of
the
landowners.
no
one
else
could
use
it.
and
they
used
it
and
paid
for
in
proportion
to
their
land.
i
--
it
occurred
to
me
in
reading
that
decision
that
the
court
might
have
reached
the
different
conclusion
were
those
the
facts,
which
is
the
fact
in
a
water
storage
district.
i
repeat
that
when
the
state
takes
a
group
of
people
and
says
now
you
may
voluntarily
bond
together
to
accomplish
this
specific
purpose
which
the
state
legislature
deems
in
the
interest
of
that
objective
in
this
case
of
agricultural
water
development.
i
don’t
think
that
that
gets
to
a
point
where
there
is
an
equal
protection
problem.
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
classification.
it’s
imposed
by
the
state
that
gives
the
group
of
people
an
opportunity
to
do
something
much
as
you
could
form
a
private
corporation.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
think
that
would
be
an
unrealistic
approach
by
a
governmental
--
by
the
legislature
to
solve
a
governmental
problem.
there
aren’t
enough
registered
voters
in
the
district
to
make
any
difference.
there
aren’t
anybody,
there’s
nobody
there.
i
mean,
you’re
not
going
to
get
people
bonding
together
to
form
a
cooperative
venture
if
you
have
registered
voters
vote.
there
aren’t
enough,
five
or
six
people?
you
take
it
you
have
each
landowner
cast
one
ballot
and
you
do
away
with
the
weighted
ballot.
as
the
appendix
points
out,
there
was
an
oil
venture
some
years
ago
and
what’s
called
the
homeland
district
which
is
the
southeastern
quadrant
of
the
basin
storage
district
and
they
saw
a
lot
of
participating
interest
in
an
oil
well
and
they’ve
got
small
acre
which
is
there.
two
acres,
ten
acres
only
from
an
oil
speculating
deal,
that
group
of
people
if
you
have
one
vote
per
landowner
would
effectively
control
the
election.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
you
mean,
if
landowners
could
vote
one
for
one,
you
wouldn’t
have
had
the
district
formed.
the
large
landowners
would
not
join
in
that.
they
wouldn’t
participate.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
see
it’s
hypothetical
in
this
instance
but
the
california
state
legislature
protected
them
from
that,
might
arranging
this
very
rational
scheme.
they
didn’t
place
that
power
and
in
the
handful
of
small
landowners.
in
other
words,
we
stand
here
stating
frankly
take
a
look
at
project
four.
the
question
is
posed
in
the
brief.
they
talked
about
thomas
j.
amos.
he
only
got
one
vote
on
ballot
a.
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
got
something
over
38,000
votes
on
ballot
a
on
project
four.
both
thomas
j.
amos
and
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
had
one
vote
on
ballot
b.
they
give
the
small
landowner
that
negative
protection
but
the
assessment
of
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
will
pay
it
for
project
four
as
$817,000
and
thomas
j.
amos
paid
$3.32.
i
mean,
we
are
dealing
with
a
practical
situation
where
the
statutory
scheme
is
designed
to
encourage
landowners
to
expand
substantial
sums
of
money
to
improve
their
water
rights.
their
water
for
agricultural
purposes
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it’s
obvious
as
an
original
proposition
that
the
state
legislature
could
encourage
this
type
of
participation
only
with
unlike
little
scheme
such
as
the
type
they
have
here.
it’s
a
limited
purpose
district.
it
doesn’t
affect
the
public.
it
affects
these
landowners
and
that’s
all
and
the
fact
that
someone
might
be
a
resident
out
there
or
an
employee
has
very
little
to
do
with
his
participation
in
these
complex
projects.
all
of
this
has
been
stated
before
and
unless
there
is
question,
i
have
no
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
i
think
so.
i
think
it
could
be
analogized
also
to
a
private
corporation
in
terms
of
voting
responsibility.
it’s
like
that.
these
people
paid
for
all
themselves
for
the
devices
that
are
limited.
they
alone
used
this.
i
again
repeat,
if
suppose
only
this
segment
of
the
population
used
the
school,
a
school
would
it
be
constitutional
to
limit
voting
on
that
particular
device.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes,
so
does
a
privately
owned
public
utility
in
california
justice
marshall.
that’s
not
any
great
indicia
status.
it
does
have
eminent
domain
but
it
cannot
exercise
that
right
of
eminent
domain
except
to
the
implementing
power
of
the
district
project.
the
directors,
the
failure
to
have
routine
elections
of
which
are
just
a
matter
of
some
comment
here
exercise
no
significant
governmental
power.
they
can’t
do
anything.
now,
there
should
have
been
election
in
1969
but
as
the
transcript
shows,
the
appendix
shows,
three
of
the
deviations
were
wholly
flooded,
100%
flooded.
one
was
56%
under
water
and
one
was
28%
under
water
and
i
can
assure
the
court
at
this
perilous
time,
these
people
were
not
interested
in
the
niceties
of
taking
a
polling
booth
on
a
style
up
there
to
have
an
election.
they
have
a
polling
booth
in
each
precinct,
each
division.
it
couldn’t
be
too
serious.
now
there
suppose
to
be
an
election
in
1973,
there
has
been
no
petition
filed
by
anybody
seeking
one
of
these
directorships.
no
doubt
because
as
mr.
greer
has
indicated
you
don’t
have
campaigning
in
the
political
sense.
it’s
different
but
there
is
no
petition
filed
to
have
any
election
this
year
so
the
incumbent
directors
will
continue
on
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
california
statute
on
the
subject.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
well,
they
don’t
pay
at
all.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
only
landowners,
that’s
all
and
they’re
assessed
in
accordance
with
the
benefit
conferred
by
a
project.
it
so
happened
that
the
projects
that
have
been
enacted
have
the
board
of
assessment,
i
forget
what
they
called
them,
but
the
commissioners
have
judged
that
it
applied
uniformly
throughout
the
district.
so
the
assessment
was
equal
for
each
taker
of
land.
there
were
no
differentials
but
it’s
possible
that
there
could
be
but
only
land
--
mr.
robert
m.
newell
no.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes,
sir.
project
four
was
$2,500,000
and
there
it
was
determined
that
there
are
188,000
plus
acres
that
were
benefited
by
their
project
and
that
was
assessed
$13.32
per
acre
irrespective
of
the
assess
value
of
a
particular
acre.
you
have
variations
and
the
assess
value
of
acres
as
i
indicated.
but
this
particular
project
was
assessed
uniformly.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
if
that
had
been
the
case,
it
so
happens
that
the
land
in
the
district
however,
most
of
it
is
[voice
overlap]
except
land
if
for
roads
or
dikes
or
things
from
that
kind.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
that
is
correct.
there
would
be
that
and
we
assume
that
on
that
hypothesis,
the
board
of
commissioners
which
--
by
the
way
none
of
them
can
own
land
in
the
district.
they
are
appointed.
they
cannot
own
land
in
the
district
at
all
and
i
think
one
must
be
an
engineer.
i
forgot
what
the
statute
requires
but
they
would
make
that
determination
and
there’s
a
right
of
sort
of
an
appeal
on
that
where
if
there’s
a
dispute,
one
of
the
commissioners
appoints
two
outside
people
and
they
set
in
a
sort
of
a
board
of
assessment
review.
presumably,
a
fair-minded
assessment
board
would
determine
that
there
was
no
benefit
to
the
pile
of
rock
that
he
would
pay
nothing.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
newell
right.
and
you’ll
notice
that
in
the
appendix,
we
refer
to
the
assess
or
in
the
brief
we
refer
to
the
fact
that
like
one
acre
has
got
a
$60
or
8/10
of
an
acre
is
assessed
at
$60
and
i
think
one
acre
is
assessed
at
$10.
there
are
differentials
in
the
assessment
depending
on
the
worth
of
the
land
but
that
would
be
different
for
the
project.
the
benefit
is
fixed
there
