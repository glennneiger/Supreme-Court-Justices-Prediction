mr.
thomas
keister
greer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
california.
like
the
case
which
the
court
just
heard,
it
also
involves
the
question
of
the
franchise
in
a
water
district.
the
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
comprehends
approximately
193,000
acres,
almost
entirely
in
kings
county
california
in
the
southern
san
joaquin
valley.
there
are
nine
water
storage
districts
in
california.
there
is
no
magic
in
the
word
storage
in
the
title.
it
functions
like
an
ordinary
water
or
ordinary
irrigation
district.
the
thing
which
sets
a
water
storage
district
apart
and
the
reason
that
these
appellants
are
here
today
are
two
california
statutes
governing
a
suffrage
in
a
water
storage
district.
the
first
is
section
41000
the
water
code.
it’s
very
short
and
clear
into
the
point
“only
the
holders
of
title
to
land
are
entitled
to
vote
at
a
general
election”
and
the
statute
immediately
following
section
4100,
“each
voter
may
vote
in
each
precinct
in
which
any
of
the
land
owned
by
him
is
situated
and
may
cast
one
vote
for
each
$100
or
fraction
thereof,
worth
of
land.”
the
appellants,
plaintiffs
below
include
a
large
land
owner.
a
salyer
land
company
farms
approximately
28,000
acres
of
land
in
the
district
and
about
another
28,000
immediately
outside.
it
includes
a
small
landowner
harold
shawl
has
one-half
interest
in
65
acres
in
the
district.
it
includes
a
nonlandowning
resident,
lawrence
allison
who
is
67
years
of
old,
has
resided,
has
worked
in
the
district.
it’s
stipulated
in
the
record
that
he
is
actively
interested
in
water
matters,
subscribes
the
water
publications.
interested
in
water
as
is
any
normal
human
being
in
this
part
of
california
can’t
vote.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
the
j.
g.
boswell
company,
mr.
chief
justice,
owns
some
61,000
acres
in
the
district.
i
think
it
leases
an
additional
8
or
10,000
acres.
it
farms
approximately
40%
of
the
district
and
has
about
40%
of
its
water.
the
--
there
are
some
landholdings
that
are
down
to
lessen
--
to
less
than
20
acres.
i
think
there
are
189
landowners
in
the
district
who
own
about
2.34%
of
the
acreage.
they
own
up
to
80
acres
of
piece.
so
there
is
a
pattern
of
a
good
many
small
landowners
and
four
large
landowners.
one
of
which
is
that
the
appellant
salyer
land
company.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
gets
37,835
votes.
there
is
an
exhibit
in
the
record,
the
voting
list
of
the
last
election
that
was
held
in
the
district.
the
only
election
has
been
held
in
the
district
in
25
years.
a
special
election
is
called
import
by
my
client
and
that
voting
list
is
a
source
that
information
37,825
votes
for
that
one
company.
now,
these
appellants
attack
these
statutes
in
the
court
below
and
they
were
both
sustained.
the
majority
sustained
each
statute,
circuit
judge
browning
concurred
in
the
exclusion
of
residence.
he
didn’t
think
there
was
enough
governmental
impact
to
justify
giving
the
ballot
to
residents
but
he
dissented
on
the
waiting
of
the
franchise.
circuit
judge
browning
wrote
a
good
and
lengthy
opinion.
he
couldn’t
go
along
with
a
notion
of
granting
one
vote
for
each
$100.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
to
gain
a
notion
of
what
this
country
looks
like,
there
is
an
aerial
photograph
which
is
exhibit
1
following
page
66
in
the
appendix.
this
district
is
divided
into
11
divisions
which
brings
up
what
is
to
me
most
--
one
of
the
most
interesting
facets
of
the
case
and
in
its
present
posture.
each
division
is
represented
by
a
director.
the
directors
are
supposed
to
be
chosen
at
these
biennial
elections
which
are
held.
now,
the
plaintiffs
below,
when
they
filed
their
suit,
of
course
the
complainant
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
also
attacked
the
manner
in
which
the
divisions
had
been
created.
the
manner,
i
should
say,
in
which
they
have
been
maintained
because
the
assessed
valuation
in
one
of
the
divisions
was
as
low
as
$600,000
in
assessed
valuation
of
one
of
my
clients,
reid
sawyer
was
$2
million.
and
we
said
that
among
the
other
things
we
said
at
any
rate,
there
are
to
be
some
equity
in
the
way
these
are
setup
according
to
assessed
valuation.
and
we
got
a
unanimous
ruling
of
the
court
below
on
that.
the
all
three
judges
said
that
these
divisions
would
have
to
be
withdrawn
so
that
they
represented
the
same
number
of
dollars.
the
decisions
may
be
considered
unique
in
that
extent
and
would
seem
to
enunciate
a
doctrine
which
i
might
call,
one
dollar
one
vote.
now
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
while
the
district
--
while
insisting
in
the
court
below
vigorously
insisted
that
it
wasn’t
a
governmental
unit
and
are
continuing
to
insist
that
in
the
briefs
before
this
court
did
not
file
a
cross-appeal.
now,
i
don’t
mean
to
belabor
the
point
but
the
court
below
relied
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
said
that
those
unequal
divisions
didn’t
consist
with
equal
protection.
it
had
defined,
it’s
a
necessary
credit
to
the
decision,
that
the
district
had
to
be
a
governmental
unit
for
to
invoke
the
equal
protection
clause
as
in
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
involving
a
disparity
in
the
size
of
districts
like
the
hadley
case
or
the
first
case
in
which
this
court
met
the
local
governmental
issue,
the
avery
case,
midland
county,
texas
and
we
think
that
since
there
has,
since
the
court
did
rule
that
way,
and
since
there
has
been
an
appeal
that
the
issue
of
a
governmental
nature
of
this
district,
i
can
establish
it
to
you
without
this
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
maybe
the
law
the
case.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
well,
i
think
my
point
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
court
below
had
to
say
that
this
is
a
governmental
district
in
[voice
overlap].
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
to
that
extent,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
wouldn’t
want
to
foreclose
him
from
any
argument
you
might
wish
to
make
but
i
just
say
that
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
governmental,
the
nature
of
district
below
maybe
--
may
have
been
adjudicated
without
appeal.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
there
are
77
residents
unless
they
be
landowners,
they
can’t
vote.
i
have
mentioned
lawrence
allison.
i
said
a
little
bit
about
the
landowners,
they
are
307
all
of
them
together.
i
have
mentioned
that
there
are
11
divisions;
six
of
those
11
divisions
are
controlled
by
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
with
those
37,825
votes.
two
of
the
divisions
are
controlled
by
the
appellant
salyer
land
company.
two
are
controlled
by
another
corporation,
west
lake
farms
and
one
by
south
lake
farms.
now,
the
rigidity
of
that
control
is
made
very
express
in
this
record.
the
frist
(inaudible)
of
the
district
based
on
1967,
based
on
my
guess
25
years
is
still
present
today.
mr.
louis
t.
robinson
told
the
california
district
securities
commission
in
1967,
“i
know
you
shouldn’t
forecast
elections
and
that
causes
me
a
little
hesitancy
to
say
what
i’m
going
to
say.”
the
11
divisions
in
this
large
farming
operation
are
completely
controlled.
you
are
going
to
have
the
same
11
directors
on
tuesday
that
you
got
today
with
one
exception.
one
of
the
directors
is
having
some
health
trouble,
he
is
going
to
be
replaced
but
other
than
that
they
are
going
to
be
the
same
11
directors
and
he
continued
(inaudible).
i
have
no
concern
about
the
election.
suddenly,
if
a
new
board
of
directors
would
come
in,
why
then
i
have
nothing
but
opinion
but
i
have
no
concern
about
the
election.
the
11
divisions
are
controlled
by
people
with
enough
votes,
put
back
the
same
electors,
they
have
the
same
directors
they
have
now
including
the
two
sawyers
had
been
sitting
at
this
time,
they’ll
be
returned,
the
other
nine
will
be
returned.
now,
what
mr.
robinson
says
about
an
election
requires
some
explanation
and
i
opt
to
say
in
the
response
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
preceding
argument
that
the
california
water
code
provides
these
elections
shall
be
conducted
in
all
respects
as
our
elections
governed
by
the
elections
code,
that’s
section
41367
of
the
water
code.
these
are
supposed
to
be
bona
fide
public
elections
without
curtaining,
without
secret
ballot
upholding
and
everything
else.
and
the
legislature
intended
that
there
would
be
one
every
other
year.
section
41300
of
the
water
code
says
an
election
known
as
the
general
water
storage
district
election
shall
be
held
in
each
district
on
the
first
tuesday
in
february
in
each
odd
numbered
year,
that
which
a
successor
shall
be
chosen
to
each
officer
whose
term
expires
in
march
next
thereafter.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
last
election,
the
last
general
election
this
district
presented
1947.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
there
is
a
provision
that
15%
of
the
land
owners
can
call
a
special
election,
that
election
which
we
called
in
1967.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no.
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
yes,
just
about
15.9%
but
we
were
joined
in
certainly
any
other
--
of
the
other
people
out
there
joined
with
us.
west
lake
farms,
i
think
joined
us.
and
that
is
the
only
election
and
this
has
made
manifest
in
the
record.
that’s
the
only
election
which
has
taken
place
since
1947.
there
is
no
motive
for
an
election.
votes
already
been
counted.
an
election
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
suspect
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
true.
i
read
my
good
friend
and
the
opponent’s
brief
in
this
case.
and
he
said
in
defending
this
system,
he
said
that
i’m
quoting
from
him
on
page
27
“one
good
test”
he
said
“of
an
electoral
system
is
artwork’s
natural
operation.
in
the
way
this
one
works
in
actual
operation
as
there
hasn’t
been
a
general
election
for
a
quarter
of
a
century.”
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
thank
you
sir.[noon
recess]
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
case
which
the
court
just
heard,
deal
with
special
districts.
the
view
of
these
appellants
is
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
voting
rights
cases
should
apply
to
a
special
district.
the
crucial
question
is,
but
what
is
the
district
concern?
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
is
concerned
with
water.
and
the
control
of
the
water
in
an
agriculture
--
in
an
agricultural
area
is
the
control
of
everything.
i
seem
to
recall
that
the
ancient
greeks
spoke
of
the
four
basic
elements
of
among
others
as
earth,
water
and
fire.
this
one
is
water.
now
there
are
myriad
of
special
districts
in
california,
i
suppose
in
most
states.
for
example,
california
has
mosquito
abatement
districts.
we
wouldn’t
have
brought
this
case
here
from
california
to
determine
a
question,
the
franchise
in
the
mosquito
abatement
district.
but
to
show
the
enormous
impact
of
this
district,
the
enormous
governmental
impact.
consider
first
at
the
very
beginning
section
43158
of
the
california
water
code.
now
a
question
was
asked
in
the
preceding
argument,
does
this
district
--
the
district
then
involved
acquire
any
rights
just
by
the
virtue
of
being
formed?
this
one
does,
and
i
quote
the
statute
“all
waters
and
water
rights
belonging
for
the
state
within
the
district
are
given
dedicated
and
set
apart
for
the
uses
and
purposes
of
a
district.”
the
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
there
would
probably
be
a
number
of
filings
of
the
director
of
finance
on
the
four
streams
going
into
tulare
lake,
the
kings,
the
kern,
the
tule,
and
the
kaweah
rivers.
some
of
them
might
be
in
court
on
a
number
of
might
be
vested
rights
if
there
would
be
a
large
number
of
potential
on
proscriptive,
appropriative,
and
riparian
rights.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
yes.
the
language
was
given,
dedicated,
and
set
apart
for
the
uses
of
the
district.
now,
the
attorney
general
of
california
was
asked
in
69,
what
the
nature
was
of
this
particular
district.
the
district
did
have
a
major
flood
and
it
was
getting
ready
to
apply
for
some
federal
funds
and
it
requested
an
official
attorney
general
opinion
to
submit
to
the
federal
government
on
the
nature
of
the
district.
the
opinion
of
the
california
attorney
general
is
set
forth
on
pages
17
and
18
of
the
district
--
of
the
appendix
and
as
referred
to
again
on
page
61
and
the
crucial
part
is
this.
this
is
an
answer
to
your
quest
for
an
opinion
--
for
our
opinion
on
the
status
of
the
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
as
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
california.
i
have
concluded
that
water
storage
districts
are
considered
political
subdivisions
of
the
state.
the
attorney
general
cited
the
leading
case,
glenn-colusa
irrigation
district
against
ohrt,
31
cal.
app.
2d
619.
and
that
case
contains
a
very
explicit
statement
of
the
governmental
nature
of
these
districts
and
also
sets
forth
a
very
clear
distinction
between
this
district
on
the
kind
of
district
that
was
involved
in
the
case
which
the
court
just
heard.
as
i
read
the
decision
of
the
wyoming
supreme
court
in
the
towtek
(ph)
case.
the
case
went
off
only
proprietary
nature
of
the
district.
the
court
used
the
proprietary
and
said
that
that
was
a
proprietary
type
district.
the
glenn-colusa
case
cited
as
i
say
by
the
attorney
general
of
california
and
the
leading
case
says
this,
“state
agencies
such
as
irrigation
or
reclamation
districts
are
agencies
of
the
state
whose
functions
are
considered
exclusively
governmental.
their
property
is
state-owned,
held
only
for
governmental
purposes,
they
own
no
land
in
the
proprietary
sense.”
now
this
district
has
the
problem
in
domain.
it
has
it,
not
at
exercises.
its
assessments
are
lands
on
all
land
of
district.
it’s
covered
by
the
special
statutes
in
california
governing
the
immunity
of
governmental
agencies.
there
is
a
special
system
in
california
whereby
governmental
agency
can
validate
its
actions
to
follow
suit,
to
validate
a
contractor,
devote
in
anything
else
it
does,
to
get
an
interim
judgment
against
the
world
and
its
--
when
its
final,
its
transactions
can
never
be
questioned.
a
very
useful
procedure
and
when
it’s
a
great
deal
used.
this
district
has
the
privilege
of
using
that
procedure,
section
860
and
following
sections
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure.
this
district
in
a
lawsuit
filed
in
federal
court
and
for
us
to
know
the
same
court
that
we’re
here
today
from,
the
eastern
district
california
intervened
parens
patriae
in
a
case
which
was
filed
on
the
issue
of
acreage
limitations.
and
said
that
it
had
the
right
to
appear
parens
patriae
in
behalf
of
the
entire
tulare
lake
basin
and
we
submit
that
if
there
is
anything
which
is
of
a
governmental
nature,
it’s
appearing
parens
patriae.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
case
of
georgia
against
pennsylvania
railroad
back
in
1945,
who
did
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
case
of
georgia
against
tennessee
copper
company,
saying
that
that
was
quasi-sovereign.
this
district
owned
its
application
to
the
federal
government
in
closing
that
opinion
from
the
attorney
general
that
$234,000
in
federal
funds.
we
are
told
in
the
briefs
of
this
gentleman
opposing
us
and
the
amici
curiae
have
insisted
on
this,
all
the
bills
are
plead
by
the
landowners.
the
landowners
didn’t
pay
that
bill.
the
--
every
citizen
in
that
district
had
an
equal
interest
in
that
federal
money
$234,000
and
the
rest
is
nevertheless
have
not
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
i
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
it
indicates
the
governmental
nature
of
the
district
and
it
also
refused
the
notion
that
all
the
financing
comes
from
the
lands,
that’s
all
i
say.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
well,
if
in
this
particular
instance,
a
statute
under
which
it
proceeded
was
a
statute
limiting
grants
to
governmental
agencies
for
road
repair,
dam
repairing
and
that
sort
of
thing
fallen
by
disaster.
this
was
under
the
office
of
emergency
preparedness
for
relief
of
governmental
agencies
which
had
suffered
disasters.
now,
the
power
of
this
district
that
i
think
is
the
most
important
is
flood
control.
the
gentleman
opposing
me
and
the
amici
have
said,
well
this
district
concerns
property.
it
doesn’t
concern
people
at
all.
it
exists
to
serve
property.
it
doesn’t
do
anything
of
interest
to
people
and
one
of
the
briefs
said
none
of
the
residents
are
interested
in
or
affected
by
anything
that
this
district
does.
second,
the
--
this
matter
of
flood
control
jurisdiction
is
the
immediate
reason
why
the
appellant
salyer
land
company
determined
to
attack
the
weighted
voting
system.
and
i
would
like
to
speak
very
briefly
about
the
legal
history
of
flood
control
and
water
storage
districts.
the
act
was
passed
in
1921.
the
declarations
of
policy
are
in
section
58
of
the
act,
stat.
1921,
c.
914
at
page
1766.
the
expression
of
prevention
of
flood
is
found
twice
in
the
paragraph
and
spoken
off
as
a
purpose
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
a
purpose
that
is
indispensable
to
the
public
interest.
now,
the
water
storage
district
law
was
codified
in
1951
based
on
the
water
code
and
those
declarations
of
policy
were
omitted
to
superfluous.
but
flood
control
is
still
specifically
referred
to
in
section
44001
and
telling
the
purposes
which
the
district
may
operate
that
they
cooperate
in
contract
with
the
districts
with
the
state
of
california
or
the
federal
government.
it
says,
for
the
following
purposes,
construction,
acquisition,
purchase,
extension,
operational
maintenance
of
works
through
irrigation,
drainage,
storage,
and
flood
control.
the
leading
case
in
california
on
water
storage
districts
is
tarpey
against
mcclure.
the
statute
was
passed
1921.
a
suit
was
immediately
filed
to
try
to
get
the
legislation
declared
invalid.
the
california
supreme
court
in
tarpey
which
was
decided
two
years
later
in
23
held
that
the
act
was
valid.
one
of
the
reasons
urged
for
its
invalidity
was
that
contrary
to
the
california
constitution,
it
embrace
more
than
one
subject
and
the
california
supreme
court
which
deals
with
water
all
the
time
were
told
that
it
has
decided
over
3,000
cases
dealing
with
water
law
said
this.
what
they
said
was,
they
said
the
flood
control
and
irrigation
are
two
sides
of
the
same
point.
they
said
that
that’s
all
one
subject.
the
actual
language
of
the
court
is
as
follows.
the
conservation
of
water
by
means
of
flood
control
work
is
to
restrain
flood
waters
which
otherwise,
it
overflow
the
land
and
go
to
waste.
and
incident
there
to,
the
reclaiming
of
the
lands
which
otherwise
reveal
were
floated
rendered
useless,
the
storage
and
distribution
of
such
water
purposes,
irrigation
all
seems
to
us
to
be
so
legitimately
and
eminently
connected
one
with
another
as
not
to
constitute
different
subjects
within
purview
of
the
constitution.
it
may
be
said
that
in
these
respects,
the
act
test
with
a
single
object
to
wit,
the
better
control
and
utilization
of
water.
now,
this
district
drew
out
its
career
until
one
time
carried
out
extensive
flood
control
jurisdiction.
exhibit
5
is
a
1953
report
from
the
present
district
that
goes
on
for
20
or
30
pages
on
all
the
flood
control
things
that
it
is
done.
and
i
have
excerpt
it
and
then
printed
in
a
trial
--
a
printed
trial
brief
re-filed
below.
all
the
matters
that
pertained
to
flood
control
are
not
in
the
appendix
but
they
are
in
a
readily
accessible
form,
should
the
court
wish
to
see
it.
finally,
my
learned
friend,
opposing
counsel
mr.
newell
stated
in
his
trial
brief,
a
printed
trial
brief
filed
in
the
court
below,
that
this
district
he
represents
is
“an
agency
authorized
by
the
north
california
to
engage
in
a
reclamation
of
water
to
reflect
protection,
drainage
and
irrigation
works.”
and
i
therefore
take
it
that
the
flood
control
jurisdiction
of
this
district
is
no
longer
a
matter
that’s
open
to
question.
that
brings
me
to
the
major
floods
of
the
last
20
years
which
have
led
to
this
litigation.
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
occupies
a
dry
lake.
it’s
dry
in
normal
years,
their
dams
on
all
four,
all
four
the
streams,
the
kings,
the
kern,
the
tule,
and
the
kaweah.
but
in
an
extraordinary
year,
in
a
flood
year,
water
comes
into
the
district.
water
overflows
this
rich
farmland
and
in
1906,
1917,
1938
--
1937,
1938,
1952
and
1969,
some
more
or
greater
portions
of
the
district
were
flooded.
1906
was
a
legendary
year
and
so
was
1969.
88,000
acres
of
the
district
land
is
flooded
in
1969.
well
now,
they
can
tell
when
it’s
going
to
be
a
flood
year.
the
--
they
can
see
the
snow
packed
up
on
the
mountains
and
the
engineer
say
that
water
content
is
very
high
and
snow
pack
is
much
ever
unusual,
we
are
going
to
have
a
flood.
buena
vista
lake
has
a
capacity
of
235,000
acre
feet.
it’s
on
kerr
county
on
the
kerr
river
south
of
tulare
lake.
the
relation
between
them
is
shown
on
exhibit
4
which
is
printed
in
the
appendix.
always,
when
it’s
evident
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
flood
on
the
kern
river,
tulare,
the
people
of
tulare
lake
and
the
people
in
this
district
have
notified
the
governing
powers
of
buena
vista
lake
take
your
flood
water
before
you
turn
it
down
on
us.
the
record
is
clearly
made
on
that.
in
the
appendix,
there
is
--
there’s
excerpt
from
the
minutes
showing
that
in
1952
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
beginning
at
page
41
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
there
is
a
reference
to
consulting
engineer
hardy
who
was
a
professor,
a
very
eminent
professor
and
his
eminence
was
stipulated
too
in
the
record,
a
leading
authority
on
water
matters
in
the
san
joaquin
valley
who
told
this
district
in
effect
your
about
to
have
a
major
flood.
now,
buena
vista
lake
should
fill
the
flood
water
of
the
kern
river
before
it
comes
down
here
to
tulare
lake.
tulare
lake
is
still
going
to
take
flood
water
from
three
rivers.
and
so
in
1952,
they
passed
a
resolution
and
it
carried
unanimously.
it
says
so
right
here
on
the
merits
which
are
in
the
appendix.
to
have
put
those
people
on
notice
in
the
name
of
this
district
and
the
president
was
authorized
to
write
a
letter
in
the
name
of
tulare
basin
water
storage
district
to
tell
buena
vista
lake
to
take
that
kern
river
flood
water
before
they
turn
it
down
on
us.
take
235,000
acre
feet
of
it.
the
notice
was
given
on
1952.
incidentally
that
was
another
example
of
the
district
exercising
its
flood
control
jurisdiction.
well
now,
the
notice
was
given
on
52
and
it
was
acquiesced.
they
couldn’t
have
done
anything
else.
the
geology
of
the
san
joaquin
valley
as
such
no
one
would
claim
that
kern
river
water
should
go
anywhere
other
than
into
buena
vista
lake
first
as
higher
up
on
the
river.
well
17
years
went
by.
another
major
flood
was
on
its
way
in
1969.
the
same
situation
exactly
obtained
except
with
one
difference.
one
crucial
difference
in
that
17-year-period
to
wit
in
the
year
1956,
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
had
at
lease
all
the
buena
vista
lake.
well
now,
that
wasn’t
the
legal
difference.
that
wasn’t
the
geological
difference.
that
wasn’t
any
difference
at
all
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
but
it
made
an
enormous
difference
in
the
1969
flood,
and
that’s
why
i’m
here
today.
the
appendix
gives
the
whole
story.
three
reclamation
districts,
smaller
units
which
are
shown
on
the
exhibit
3
printed
in
the
appendix,
petition
this
district.
“please
put
buena
vista
lake
on
notice
again.”
a
1,100,000
acre
feet
of
water
was
on
its
way
to
tulare
lake.
a
1,100,000
acre
feet
of
water,
i
think
actually
another
69,000
came
to
tulare
lake
in
the
year
1969
and
the
district
was
formally
petitioned
by
resolutions
drawn
by
other
public
bodies
notified
buena
vista
lake
as
you
did
before.
those
1952
notices
have
been
effective
and
they
have
not
been
ignored.
there
was
a
meeting
of
this
district
on
march
4,
1969.
the
entire
minutes
are
in
evidence
as
exhibit
6
and
portions
to
the
minutes
are
excerpted
in
the
appendix.
there
were
10
directors
present,
normally
11
but
one
of
them
had
just
died
and
there
had
have
been
a
time
enough
yet
to
fill
his
vacancy.
six
of
them
were
associated
with
the
j.
g.
boswell
company.
a
motion
was
made
fully
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
again
give
buena
vista
lake
interest
notice,
a
motion
--
the
motion
was
made
and
it
was
immediately
moved
that
that
be
tabled.
one
boswell
director
moved
that
it
be
table
in
another
second,
and
at
that
point,
counsel
appeared
for
the
boswell
company
and
what
he
said
is
in
the
minutes.
it’s
--
the
excerpt
is
given
on
page
48
of
the
appendix.
that
is
a
remarkable
statement.
able
counsel
for
the
boswell
company
was
mr.
clauster
and
the
minute
state
as
follows.
attorney
clauster
at
this
point
made
disclosure
for
the
record
as
the
association
of
six
of
the
directors
of
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
indicating
in
some
detail
their
stock
ownerships
and
employee
affiliations.
and
then
he
gives
the
six
directors
and
he
said
stated
further
that
he
advised
these
directors,
they
were
not
disqualified
to
vote
on
the
buena
vista
matter.
the
motion
to
a
table
carried
6-4,
buena
vista
lake
was
given
no
notice
in
1969.
one-fifth
of
the
water
that
came
into
that
lake
--
into
tulare
lake
in
1969
should
have
been
at
buena
vista.
the
crest
to
the
water
was
192.5,
the
residences,
most
of
them,
you
can
see
from
the
topographical
map
which
is
exhibit
2
and
3
are
both
topographical
maps,
are
around
177.
the
level
of
that
water
was
15-1/2
feet
over
the
homes.
had
a
levee
broken,
those
homes
had
been
flooded.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
oh,
thank
you
sir.
the
level
of
the
water
was
15-1/2
feet
higher
than
the
homes
in
the
district.
had
a
levee
broken
and
it
was
just
a
nip
or
tuck
matter
as
to
where
the
north
central
levee
have
been
held.
there
are
60
some
persons
who
would
have
been
an
imminent
danger
of
dying
from
a
wall
of
water,
15-1/2
feet
over
the
heads
and
these
appellants
respectively
submit
that
those
persons
would
have
been
interested
in
and
affected
by
such
a
development.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
it
would
depend
on
whether
a
levee
have
reached.
now,
typically
when
a
levee
goes,
the
pressure
behind
it
is
so
great
that
there
is
no
--
it
happens
all
at
once.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
sir?
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no
sir
not
at
all.
the
water
is
there
and
it’s
at
a
very
high
level.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
there
is
a
very
complex
system
relating
to
governmental
immunity
in
california.
we
filed
an
action
which
there
is
exhibit
dealing
with
it
to
remove
the
six
boswell
directors.
we
wanted
to
get
some
relief
definitely
and
i’m
--
i
have
to
say
to
the
court
that
i
did
not
have
much
success
with
that
case.
it
has
been
pending
on
the
merits
since
october
of
1969
and
has
become
moot
by
virtue
of
the
election
of
these
directors
over
again,
the
reason
that
we
follow
the
present
proceedings.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
think
yes.
i
think
the
tort
cause
of
action
could
have
been
stated.
i
mentioned
that
though
to
show
the
interests
of
the
residents
in
the
authorities
of
the
district
because
that
water
was
higher
than
it
otherwise
it
would
have
been
because
of
the
boswell
records
preventing
us
from
giving
notice
to
buena
vista
lake.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
california.
like
the
case
which
the
court
just
heard,
it
also
involves
the
question
of
the
franchise
in
a
water
district.
the
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
comprehends
approximately
193,000
acres,
almost
entirely
in
kings
county
california
in
the
southern
san
joaquin
valley.
there
are
nine
water
storage
districts
in
california.
there
is
no
magic
in
the
word
storage
in
the
title.
it
functions
like
an
ordinary
water
or
ordinary
irrigation
district.
the
thing
which
sets
a
water
storage
district
apart
and
the
reason
that
these
appellants
are
here
today
are
two
california
statutes
governing
a
suffrage
in
a
water
storage
district.
the
first
is
section
41000
the
water
code.
it’s
very
short
and
clear
into
the
point
“only
the
holders
of
title
to
land
are
entitled
to
vote
at
a
general
election”
and
the
statute
immediately
following
section
4100,
“each
voter
may
vote
in
each
precinct
in
which
any
of
the
land
owned
by
him
is
situated
and
may
cast
one
vote
for
each
$100
or
fraction
thereof,
worth
of
land.”
the
appellants,
plaintiffs
below
include
a
large
land
owner.
a
salyer
land
company
farms
approximately
28,000
acres
of
land
in
the
district
and
about
another
28,000
immediately
outside.
it
includes
a
small
landowner
harold
shawl
has
one-half
interest
in
65
acres
in
the
district.
it
includes
a
nonlandowning
resident,
lawrence
allison
who
is
67
years
of
old,
has
resided,
has
worked
in
the
district.
it’s
stipulated
in
the
record
that
he
is
actively
interested
in
water
matters,
subscribes
the
water
publications.
interested
in
water
as
is
any
normal
human
being
in
this
part
of
california
can’t
vote.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
the
j.
g.
boswell
company,
mr.
chief
justice,
owns
some
61,000
acres
in
the
district.
i
think
it
leases
an
additional
8
or
10,000
acres.
it
farms
approximately
40%
of
the
district
and
has
about
40%
of
its
water.
the
--
there
are
some
landholdings
that
are
down
to
lessen
--
to
less
than
20
acres.
i
think
there
are
189
landowners
in
the
district
who
own
about
2.34%
of
the
acreage.
they
own
up
to
80
acres
of
piece.
so
there
is
a
pattern
of
a
good
many
small
landowners
and
four
large
landowners.
one
of
which
is
that
the
appellant
salyer
land
company.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
gets
37,835
votes.
there
is
an
exhibit
in
the
record,
the
voting
list
of
the
last
election
that
was
held
in
the
district.
the
only
election
has
been
held
in
the
district
in
25
years.
a
special
election
is
called
import
by
my
client
and
that
voting
list
is
a
source
that
information
37,825
votes
for
that
one
company.
now,
these
appellants
attack
these
statutes
in
the
court
below
and
they
were
both
sustained.
the
majority
sustained
each
statute,
circuit
judge
browning
concurred
in
the
exclusion
of
residence.
he
didn’t
think
there
was
enough
governmental
impact
to
justify
giving
the
ballot
to
residents
but
he
dissented
on
the
waiting
of
the
franchise.
circuit
judge
browning
wrote
a
good
and
lengthy
opinion.
he
couldn’t
go
along
with
a
notion
of
granting
one
vote
for
each
$100.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
to
gain
a
notion
of
what
this
country
looks
like,
there
is
an
aerial
photograph
which
is
exhibit
1
following
page
66
in
the
appendix.
this
district
is
divided
into
11
divisions
which
brings
up
what
is
to
me
most
--
one
of
the
most
interesting
facets
of
the
case
and
in
its
present
posture.
each
division
is
represented
by
a
director.
the
directors
are
supposed
to
be
chosen
at
these
biennial
elections
which
are
held.
now,
the
plaintiffs
below,
when
they
filed
their
suit,
of
course
the
complainant
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
also
attacked
the
manner
in
which
the
divisions
had
been
created.
the
manner,
i
should
say,
in
which
they
have
been
maintained
because
the
assessed
valuation
in
one
of
the
divisions
was
as
low
as
$600,000
in
assessed
valuation
of
one
of
my
clients,
reid
sawyer
was
$2
million.
and
we
said
that
among
the
other
things
we
said
at
any
rate,
there
are
to
be
some
equity
in
the
way
these
are
setup
according
to
assessed
valuation.
and
we
got
a
unanimous
ruling
of
the
court
below
on
that.
the
all
three
judges
said
that
these
divisions
would
have
to
be
withdrawn
so
that
they
represented
the
same
number
of
dollars.
the
decisions
may
be
considered
unique
in
that
extent
and
would
seem
to
enunciate
a
doctrine
which
i
might
call,
one
dollar
one
vote.
now
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
while
the
district
--
while
insisting
in
the
court
below
vigorously
insisted
that
it
wasn’t
a
governmental
unit
and
are
continuing
to
insist
that
in
the
briefs
before
this
court
did
not
file
a
cross-appeal.
now,
i
don’t
mean
to
belabor
the
point
but
the
court
below
relied
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
said
that
those
unequal
divisions
didn’t
consist
with
equal
protection.
it
had
defined,
it’s
a
necessary
credit
to
the
decision,
that
the
district
had
to
be
a
governmental
unit
for
to
invoke
the
equal
protection
clause
as
in
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
involving
a
disparity
in
the
size
of
districts
like
the
hadley
case
or
the
first
case
in
which
this
court
met
the
local
governmental
issue,
the
avery
case,
midland
county,
texas
and
we
think
that
since
there
has,
since
the
court
did
rule
that
way,
and
since
there
has
been
an
appeal
that
the
issue
of
a
governmental
nature
of
this
district,
i
can
establish
it
to
you
without
this
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
maybe
the
law
the
case.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
well,
i
think
my
point
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
court
below
had
to
say
that
this
is
a
governmental
district
in
[voice
overlap].
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
to
that
extent,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
wouldn’t
want
to
foreclose
him
from
any
argument
you
might
wish
to
make
but
i
just
say
that
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
governmental,
the
nature
of
district
below
maybe
--
may
have
been
adjudicated
without
appeal.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
there
are
77
residents
unless
they
be
landowners,
they
can’t
vote.
i
have
mentioned
lawrence
allison.
i
said
a
little
bit
about
the
landowners,
they
are
307
all
of
them
together.
i
have
mentioned
that
there
are
11
divisions;
six
of
those
11
divisions
are
controlled
by
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
with
those
37,825
votes.
two
of
the
divisions
are
controlled
by
the
appellant
salyer
land
company.
two
are
controlled
by
another
corporation,
west
lake
farms
and
one
by
south
lake
farms.
now,
the
rigidity
of
that
control
is
made
very
express
in
this
record.
the
frist
(inaudible)
of
the
district
based
on
1967,
based
on
my
guess
25
years
is
still
present
today.
mr.
louis
t.
robinson
told
the
california
district
securities
commission
in
1967,
“i
know
you
shouldn’t
forecast
elections
and
that
causes
me
a
little
hesitancy
to
say
what
i’m
going
to
say.”
the
11
divisions
in
this
large
farming
operation
are
completely
controlled.
you
are
going
to
have
the
same
11
directors
on
tuesday
that
you
got
today
with
one
exception.
one
of
the
directors
is
having
some
health
trouble,
he
is
going
to
be
replaced
but
other
than
that
they
are
going
to
be
the
same
11
directors
and
he
continued
(inaudible).
i
have
no
concern
about
the
election.
suddenly,
if
a
new
board
of
directors
would
come
in,
why
then
i
have
nothing
but
opinion
but
i
have
no
concern
about
the
election.
the
11
divisions
are
controlled
by
people
with
enough
votes,
put
back
the
same
electors,
they
have
the
same
directors
they
have
now
including
the
two
sawyers
had
been
sitting
at
this
time,
they’ll
be
returned,
the
other
nine
will
be
returned.
now,
what
mr.
robinson
says
about
an
election
requires
some
explanation
and
i
opt
to
say
in
the
response
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
preceding
argument
that
the
california
water
code
provides
these
elections
shall
be
conducted
in
all
respects
as
our
elections
governed
by
the
elections
code,
that’s
section
41367
of
the
water
code.
these
are
supposed
to
be
bona
fide
public
elections
without
curtaining,
without
secret
ballot
upholding
and
everything
else.
and
the
legislature
intended
that
there
would
be
one
every
other
year.
section
41300
of
the
water
code
says
an
election
known
as
the
general
water
storage
district
election
shall
be
held
in
each
district
on
the
first
tuesday
in
february
in
each
odd
numbered
year,
that
which
a
successor
shall
be
chosen
to
each
officer
whose
term
expires
in
march
next
thereafter.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
last
election,
the
last
general
election
this
district
presented
1947.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
there
is
a
provision
that
15%
of
the
land
owners
can
call
a
special
election,
that
election
which
we
called
in
1967.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no.
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
yes,
just
about
15.9%
but
we
were
joined
in
certainly
any
other
--
of
the
other
people
out
there
joined
with
us.
west
lake
farms,
i
think
joined
us.
and
that
is
the
only
election
and
this
has
made
manifest
in
the
record.
that’s
the
only
election
which
has
taken
place
since
1947.
there
is
no
motive
for
an
election.
votes
already
been
counted.
an
election
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
suspect
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
true.
i
read
my
good
friend
and
the
opponent’s
brief
in
this
case.
and
he
said
in
defending
this
system,
he
said
that
i’m
quoting
from
him
on
page
27
“one
good
test”
he
said
“of
an
electoral
system
is
artwork’s
natural
operation.
in
the
way
this
one
works
in
actual
operation
as
there
hasn’t
been
a
general
election
for
a
quarter
of
a
century.”
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
thank
you
sir.[noon
recess]
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
case
which
the
court
just
heard,
deal
with
special
districts.
the
view
of
these
appellants
is
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
voting
rights
cases
should
apply
to
a
special
district.
the
crucial
question
is,
but
what
is
the
district
concern?
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
is
concerned
with
water.
and
the
control
of
the
water
in
an
agriculture
--
in
an
agricultural
area
is
the
control
of
everything.
i
seem
to
recall
that
the
ancient
greeks
spoke
of
the
four
basic
elements
of
among
others
as
earth,
water
and
fire.
this
one
is
water.
now
there
are
myriad
of
special
districts
in
california,
i
suppose
in
most
states.
for
example,
california
has
mosquito
abatement
districts.
we
wouldn’t
have
brought
this
case
here
from
california
to
determine
a
question,
the
franchise
in
the
mosquito
abatement
district.
but
to
show
the
enormous
impact
of
this
district,
the
enormous
governmental
impact.
consider
first
at
the
very
beginning
section
43158
of
the
california
water
code.
now
a
question
was
asked
in
the
preceding
argument,
does
this
district
--
the
district
then
involved
acquire
any
rights
just
by
the
virtue
of
being
formed?
this
one
does,
and
i
quote
the
statute
“all
waters
and
water
rights
belonging
for
the
state
within
the
district
are
given
dedicated
and
set
apart
for
the
uses
and
purposes
of
a
district.”
the
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
there
would
probably
be
a
number
of
filings
of
the
director
of
finance
on
the
four
streams
going
into
tulare
lake,
the
kings,
the
kern,
the
tule,
and
the
kaweah
rivers.
some
of
them
might
be
in
court
on
a
number
of
might
be
vested
rights
if
there
would
be
a
large
number
of
potential
on
proscriptive,
appropriative,
and
riparian
rights.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
yes.
the
language
was
given,
dedicated,
and
set
apart
for
the
uses
of
the
district.
now,
the
attorney
general
of
california
was
asked
in
69,
what
the
nature
was
of
this
particular
district.
the
district
did
have
a
major
flood
and
it
was
getting
ready
to
apply
for
some
federal
funds
and
it
requested
an
official
attorney
general
opinion
to
submit
to
the
federal
government
on
the
nature
of
the
district.
the
opinion
of
the
california
attorney
general
is
set
forth
on
pages
17
and
18
of
the
district
--
of
the
appendix
and
as
referred
to
again
on
page
61
and
the
crucial
part
is
this.
this
is
an
answer
to
your
quest
for
an
opinion
--
for
our
opinion
on
the
status
of
the
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district
as
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
california.
i
have
concluded
that
water
storage
districts
are
considered
political
subdivisions
of
the
state.
the
attorney
general
cited
the
leading
case,
glenn-colusa
irrigation
district
against
ohrt,
31
cal.
app.
2d
619.
and
that
case
contains
a
very
explicit
statement
of
the
governmental
nature
of
these
districts
and
also
sets
forth
a
very
clear
distinction
between
this
district
on
the
kind
of
district
that
was
involved
in
the
case
which
the
court
just
heard.
as
i
read
the
decision
of
the
wyoming
supreme
court
in
the
towtek
(ph)
case.
the
case
went
off
only
proprietary
nature
of
the
district.
the
court
used
the
proprietary
and
said
that
that
was
a
proprietary
type
district.
the
glenn-colusa
case
cited
as
i
say
by
the
attorney
general
of
california
and
the
leading
case
says
this,
“state
agencies
such
as
irrigation
or
reclamation
districts
are
agencies
of
the
state
whose
functions
are
considered
exclusively
governmental.
their
property
is
state-owned,
held
only
for
governmental
purposes,
they
own
no
land
in
the
proprietary
sense.”
now
this
district
has
the
problem
in
domain.
it
has
it,
not
at
exercises.
its
assessments
are
lands
on
all
land
of
district.
it’s
covered
by
the
special
statutes
in
california
governing
the
immunity
of
governmental
agencies.
there
is
a
special
system
in
california
whereby
governmental
agency
can
validate
its
actions
to
follow
suit,
to
validate
a
contractor,
devote
in
anything
else
it
does,
to
get
an
interim
judgment
against
the
world
and
its
--
when
its
final,
its
transactions
can
never
be
questioned.
a
very
useful
procedure
and
when
it’s
a
great
deal
used.
this
district
has
the
privilege
of
using
that
procedure,
section
860
and
following
sections
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure.
this
district
in
a
lawsuit
filed
in
federal
court
and
for
us
to
know
the
same
court
that
we’re
here
today
from,
the
eastern
district
california
intervened
parens
patriae
in
a
case
which
was
filed
on
the
issue
of
acreage
limitations.
and
said
that
it
had
the
right
to
appear
parens
patriae
in
behalf
of
the
entire
tulare
lake
basin
and
we
submit
that
if
there
is
anything
which
is
of
a
governmental
nature,
it’s
appearing
parens
patriae.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
case
of
georgia
against
pennsylvania
railroad
back
in
1945,
who
did
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
case
of
georgia
against
tennessee
copper
company,
saying
that
that
was
quasi-sovereign.
this
district
owned
its
application
to
the
federal
government
in
closing
that
opinion
from
the
attorney
general
that
$234,000
in
federal
funds.
we
are
told
in
the
briefs
of
this
gentleman
opposing
us
and
the
amici
curiae
have
insisted
on
this,
all
the
bills
are
plead
by
the
landowners.
the
landowners
didn’t
pay
that
bill.
the
--
every
citizen
in
that
district
had
an
equal
interest
in
that
federal
money
$234,000
and
the
rest
is
nevertheless
have
not
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
i
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
it
indicates
the
governmental
nature
of
the
district
and
it
also
refused
the
notion
that
all
the
financing
comes
from
the
lands,
that’s
all
i
say.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
well,
if
in
this
particular
instance,
a
statute
under
which
it
proceeded
was
a
statute
limiting
grants
to
governmental
agencies
for
road
repair,
dam
repairing
and
that
sort
of
thing
fallen
by
disaster.
this
was
under
the
office
of
emergency
preparedness
for
relief
of
governmental
agencies
which
had
suffered
disasters.
now,
the
power
of
this
district
that
i
think
is
the
most
important
is
flood
control.
the
gentleman
opposing
me
and
the
amici
have
said,
well
this
district
concerns
property.
it
doesn’t
concern
people
at
all.
it
exists
to
serve
property.
it
doesn’t
do
anything
of
interest
to
people
and
one
of
the
briefs
said
none
of
the
residents
are
interested
in
or
affected
by
anything
that
this
district
does.
second,
the
--
this
matter
of
flood
control
jurisdiction
is
the
immediate
reason
why
the
appellant
salyer
land
company
determined
to
attack
the
weighted
voting
system.
and
i
would
like
to
speak
very
briefly
about
the
legal
history
of
flood
control
and
water
storage
districts.
the
act
was
passed
in
1921.
the
declarations
of
policy
are
in
section
58
of
the
act,
stat.
1921,
c.
914
at
page
1766.
the
expression
of
prevention
of
flood
is
found
twice
in
the
paragraph
and
spoken
off
as
a
purpose
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
a
purpose
that
is
indispensable
to
the
public
interest.
now,
the
water
storage
district
law
was
codified
in
1951
based
on
the
water
code
and
those
declarations
of
policy
were
omitted
to
superfluous.
but
flood
control
is
still
specifically
referred
to
in
section
44001
and
telling
the
purposes
which
the
district
may
operate
that
they
cooperate
in
contract
with
the
districts
with
the
state
of
california
or
the
federal
government.
it
says,
for
the
following
purposes,
construction,
acquisition,
purchase,
extension,
operational
maintenance
of
works
through
irrigation,
drainage,
storage,
and
flood
control.
the
leading
case
in
california
on
water
storage
districts
is
tarpey
against
mcclure.
the
statute
was
passed
1921.
a
suit
was
immediately
filed
to
try
to
get
the
legislation
declared
invalid.
the
california
supreme
court
in
tarpey
which
was
decided
two
years
later
in
23
held
that
the
act
was
valid.
one
of
the
reasons
urged
for
its
invalidity
was
that
contrary
to
the
california
constitution,
it
embrace
more
than
one
subject
and
the
california
supreme
court
which
deals
with
water
all
the
time
were
told
that
it
has
decided
over
3,000
cases
dealing
with
water
law
said
this.
what
they
said
was,
they
said
the
flood
control
and
irrigation
are
two
sides
of
the
same
point.
they
said
that
that’s
all
one
subject.
the
actual
language
of
the
court
is
as
follows.
the
conservation
of
water
by
means
of
flood
control
work
is
to
restrain
flood
waters
which
otherwise,
it
overflow
the
land
and
go
to
waste.
and
incident
there
to,
the
reclaiming
of
the
lands
which
otherwise
reveal
were
floated
rendered
useless,
the
storage
and
distribution
of
such
water
purposes,
irrigation
all
seems
to
us
to
be
so
legitimately
and
eminently
connected
one
with
another
as
not
to
constitute
different
subjects
within
purview
of
the
constitution.
it
may
be
said
that
in
these
respects,
the
act
test
with
a
single
object
to
wit,
the
better
control
and
utilization
of
water.
now,
this
district
drew
out
its
career
until
one
time
carried
out
extensive
flood
control
jurisdiction.
exhibit
5
is
a
1953
report
from
the
present
district
that
goes
on
for
20
or
30
pages
on
all
the
flood
control
things
that
it
is
done.
and
i
have
excerpt
it
and
then
printed
in
a
trial
--
a
printed
trial
brief
re-filed
below.
all
the
matters
that
pertained
to
flood
control
are
not
in
the
appendix
but
they
are
in
a
readily
accessible
form,
should
the
court
wish
to
see
it.
finally,
my
learned
friend,
opposing
counsel
mr.
newell
stated
in
his
trial
brief,
a
printed
trial
brief
filed
in
the
court
below,
that
this
district
he
represents
is
“an
agency
authorized
by
the
north
california
to
engage
in
a
reclamation
of
water
to
reflect
protection,
drainage
and
irrigation
works.”
and
i
therefore
take
it
that
the
flood
control
jurisdiction
of
this
district
is
no
longer
a
matter
that’s
open
to
question.
that
brings
me
to
the
major
floods
of
the
last
20
years
which
have
led
to
this
litigation.

a
dry

all

the

the

the

and
the

but
in
an
extraordinary
year,
in
a
flood
year,
water
comes
into
the
district.
water
overflows
this
rich
farmland
and
in
1906,
1917,
1938
--
1937,
1938,
1952
and
1969,
some
more
or
greater
portions
of
the
district
were
flooded.
1906
was
a
legendary
year
and
so
was
1969.
88,000
acres
of
the
district
land
is
flooded
in
1969.
well
now,
they
can
tell
when
it’s
going
to
be
a
flood
year.
the
--
they
can
see
the
snow
packed
up
on
the
mountains
and
the
engineer
say
that
water
content
is
very
high
and
snow
pack
is
much
ever
unusual,
we
are
going
to
have
a
flood.
buena
vista
lake
has
a
capacity
of
235,000
acre
feet.
it’s
on
kerr
county
on
the
kerr
river
south
of
tulare
lake.
the
relation
between
them
is
shown
on
exhibit
4
which
is
printed
in
the
appendix.
always,
when
it’s
evident
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
flood
on
the
kern
river,
tulare,
the
people
of
tulare
lake
and
the
people
in
this
district
have
notified
the
governing
powers
of
buena
vista
lake
take
your
flood
water
before
you
turn
it
down
on
us.
the
record
is
clearly
made
on
that.
in
the
appendix,
there
is
--
there’s
excerpt
from
the
minutes
showing
that
in
1952
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
beginning
at
page
41
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
there
is
a
reference
to
consulting
engineer
hardy
who
was
a
professor,
a
very
eminent
professor
and
his
eminence
was
stipulated
too
in
the
record,
a
leading
authority
on
water
matters
in
the
san
joaquin
valley
who
told
this
district
in
effect
your
about
to
have
a
major
flood.
now,
buena
vista
lake
should
fill
the
flood
water
of
the
kern
river
before
it
comes
down
here
to
tulare
lake.
tulare
lake
is
still
going
to
take
flood
water
from
three
rivers.
and
so
in
1952,
they
passed
a
resolution
and
it
carried
unanimously.
it
says
so
right
here
on
the
merits
which
are
in
the
appendix.
to
have
put
those
people
on
notice
in
the
name
of
this
district
and
the
president
was
authorized
to
write
a
letter
in
the
name
of
tulare

water

district
to
tell
buena

to
take

235,000
acre

of
it.
the
notice
was
given
on
1952.
incidentally
that
was
another
example
of
the
district
exercising
its
flood
control
jurisdiction.
well
now,
the
notice
was
given
on
52
and
it
was
acquiesced.
they
couldn’t
have
done
anything
else.
the
geology
of
the
san
joaquin
valley
as
such
no
one
would
claim
that
kern
river
water
should
go
anywhere
other
than
into
buena

lake
first
as
higher
up
on
the
river.
well
17
years
went
by.
another
major
flood
was
on
its
way
in
1969.
the
same
situation
exactly
obtained
except
with
one
difference.
one
crucial
difference
in
that
17-year-period
to
wit
in
the
year
1956,
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
had
at
lease
all
the
buena
vista
lake.
well
now,
that
wasn’t
the
legal
difference.
that
wasn’t
the
geological
difference.
that
wasn’t
any
difference
at
all
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
but
it
made
an
enormous
difference
in
the
1969
flood,
and
that’s
why
i’m
here
today.
the
appendix
gives
the
whole
story.
three
reclamation
districts,
smaller
units
which
are
shown
on
the
exhibit
3
printed
in
the
appendix,
petition
this
district.
“please
put
buena
vista
lake
on
notice
again.”
a
1,100,000
acre
feet
of
water
was
on
its
way
to
tulare
lake.
a
1,100,000
acre
feet
of
water,
i
think
actually
another
69,000
came
to
tulare
lake
in
the
year
1969
and
the
district
was
formally
petitioned
by
resolutions
drawn
by
other
public
bodies
notified
buena
vista
lake
as
you
did
before.
those
1952
notices
have
been
effective
and
they
have
not
been
ignored.
there
was
a
meeting
of
this
district
on
march
4,
1969.
the
entire
minutes
are
in
evidence
as
exhibit
6
and
portions
to
the
minutes
are
excerpted
in
the
appendix.
there
were
10
directors
present,
normally
11
but
one
of
them
had
just
died
and
there
had
have
been
a
time
enough
yet
to
fill
his
vacancy.
six
of
them
were
associated
with
the
j.
g.
boswell
company.
a
motion
was
made
fully
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
again
give
buena
vista
lake
interest
notice,
a
motion
--
the
motion
was
made
and
it
was
immediately
moved

tabled.
one
boswell
director
moved
that
it
be
table
in
another
second,
and
at
that
point,
counsel
appeared
for
the
boswell
company
and
what
he
said
is
in
the
minutes.
it’s
--
the
excerpt
is
given
on
page
48
of
the
appendix.
that
is
a
remarkable
statement.
able
counsel
for
the
boswell
company
was
mr.
clauster
and
the
minute
state
as
follows.
attorney
clauster
at
this
point
made
disclosure
for
the
record
as
the
association
of
six
of
the
directors
of
the
j.
g.
boswell
company
indicating
in
some
detail
their
stock
ownerships
and
employee
affiliations.
and
then
he
gives
the
six
directors
and
he
said
stated
further
that
he
advised
these
directors,
they
were
not
disqualified
to
vote
on
the
buena
vista
matter.
the
motion
to
a
table
carried
6-4,
buena
vista
lake
was
given
no
notice
in
1969.
one-fifth
of
the
water
that
came
into
that
lake
--
into
tulare
lake
in
1969
should
have
been
at
buena
vista.
the
crest
to
the
water
was
192.5,
the
residences,
most
of
them,
you
can
see
from
the
topographical
map
which
is
exhibit
2
and
3
are
both
topographical
maps,
are
around
177.
the
level
of
that
water
was
15-1/2
feet
over
the
homes.
had
a
levee
broken,
those
homes
had
been
flooded.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
oh,
thank
you
sir.
the
level
of
the
water
was
15-1/2
feet
higher
than
the
homes
in
the
district.
had
a
levee
broken
and
it
was
just
a
nip
or
tuck
matter
as
to
where
the
north
central
levee
have
been
held.
there
are
60
some
persons
who
would
have
been
an
imminent
danger
of
dying
from
a
wall
of
water,
15-1/2
feet
over
the
heads
and
these
appellants
respectively
submit
that
those
persons
would
have
been
interested
in
and
affected
by
such
a
development.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
it
would
depend
on
whether
a
levee
have
reached.
now,
typically
when
a
levee
goes,
the
pressure
behind
it
is
so
great
that
there
is
no
--
it
happens
all
at
once.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
sir?
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no
sir
not
at
all.
the
water
is
there
and
it’s
at
a
very
high
level.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
there
is
a
very
complex
system
relating
to
governmental
immunity
in
california.
we
filed
an
action
which
there
is
exhibit
dealing
with
it
to
remove
the
six
boswell
directors.
we
wanted
to
get
some
relief
definitely
and
i’m
--
i
have
to
say
to
the
court
that
i
did
not
have
much
success
with
that
case.
it
has
been
pending
on
the
merits
since
october
of
1969
and
has
become
moot
by
virtue
of
the
election
of
these
directors
over
again,
the
reason
that
we
follow
the
present
proceedings.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
think
yes.
i
think
the
tort
cause
of
action
could
have
been
stated.
i
mentioned
that
though
to
show
the
interests
of
the
residents
in
the
authorities
of
the
district
because
that
water
was
higher
than
it
otherwise
it
would
have
been
because
of
the
boswell
records
preventing
us
from
giving
notice
to
buena
vista
lake.
thank
you
sir.
