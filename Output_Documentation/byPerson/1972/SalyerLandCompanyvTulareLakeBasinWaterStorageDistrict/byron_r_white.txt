justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
your
opponent’s
brief
stand
the
judges
below
on
any
ground
he
wants
to
even
if
it
was
rejected
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
says
it
isn’t.
his
position
was
rejected
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
can
he
sustain?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
district
has
validly
hold
an
election
under
a
law
that
said
that,
half
of
the
landowners
may
vote
and
half
may
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
has
--
is
that
anything
to
do
with
the
reinforcement
cases,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
one
man,
one
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
whether
somebody
has
invidiously
precluded
from
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
how
about
my
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
got
perfectly
good
question.
so
it
really
isn’t
a
question
to
one
man
one
vote,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
it
isn’t.
so
it’s
--
but
it
is
a
question
whether
somebody
is
validly
or
invidiously
excluded
from
voting.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
asked
me
that
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
a
valid
classification?
that’s
the
same
question
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
and
if
it
isn’t
reasonable,
it’s
invidiously
excluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
so
your
question
is,
which
is
here
as
whether
the
vote
maybe
limited
to
landowner.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
vote
here
was
limited
--
every
other
landowner
could
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
the
--
i
suppose
the
district
could
be
set
up
in
a
way
that
it
didn’t
accumulate
votes
based
on
acreage?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
automatically
going
--
can
you
automatically
get
out
if
you
want
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
that
case
should
go
away
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
somebody
petitions
for
a
water
improvement
district
to
cover
certain
area
that
everybody
within
that
area
is
not
included
if
there
is
the
right
kind
of
a
vote
in
the
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
landowner?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
lessees?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
agree
if
you
--
i
mean
you
certainly
have
solved
the
case
if
you
start
with
the
premise
that
you
can
tie
the
power
to
the
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
this
is
over
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
what’s
at
issue
here
as
to
--
is
the
voting
rights
are
at
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
are
at
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it?
it
was
a
flood
control
project.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
was
private
--
but
it
was
partly
flood
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
an
interest
to,
with
good
many
people
i
suppose?
other
than
landowners?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
77
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
how
about
as
an
--
how
about
in
the
decision
as
to
whether
the
former
flood
control
project.
what
about
people
--
just
ordinary
people
nonlandowners
who
might
get
flooded.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
i
suppose
they
are
likelihood
--
their
right
is
their
own
at
least.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
houses?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
your
opponent’s
brief
stand
the
judges
below
on
any
ground
he
wants
to
even
if

was

his

yes,

can

it
is
a
question
whether

is
validly

invidiously

from

justice
byron
