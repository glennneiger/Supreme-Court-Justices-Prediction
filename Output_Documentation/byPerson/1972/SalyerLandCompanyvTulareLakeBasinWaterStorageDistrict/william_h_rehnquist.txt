we
have
a
remedy
under
state
law
if
you
object
to
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
salyer
have
that
15%?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
typically,
what
water
rights
would
belong
to
the
state
in
a
district
such
as
this
so
they
come
within
the
definition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
state
in
effect
says
that
the
district
takes
over
for
the
state
in
that
instance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
counsel
on
the
last
case
observed
it
lucky.
he’s
gotten
a
lot
of
federal
money
too.
and
that
presumably
that
didn’t
give
the
right
of
every
resident
in
the
lucky
board
of
directors.
are
you
saying
that
receipt
of
federal
money
is
determinative
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
the
federal
government
does
give
up
money
on
occasion
or
a
loan
money
to
non-governmental
entities,
doesn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
district
suable
at
tort
in
--
under
california
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
any
of
these
homes
had
been
washed
out
as
a
result
of
claimed,
negligence,
or
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
directors.
would
the
district
have
been
liable
for
a
suit
in
tort?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
an
individual
landowner
can
be
involuntary
included
within
the
district?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that’s
discretionary
with
the
board
of
directors
of
the
district,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don’t
have
a
matter.
you
cannot
be
excluded
as
a
matter
of
right.
that’s
the
reason
i
feel
fairly
accomplished
arizona
where
i
tried,
has
adopted
california’s
system
in
this
and
at
least
under
our
law,
you
could
petition
for
exclusion
but
it
was
discretionary
with
the
people
who
passed
on
that
petition
whether
or
not
you
would
be
excluded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it’s
just
voluntary
landowners,
you
don’t
need
a
district.
you
could
do
it
by
contract.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
man
with
the
pile
of
rocks
being
obligated
to
pay
would
be
dependent
upon
a
finding
by
the
assessors
but
though
that
land
did
in
fact
benefit.
