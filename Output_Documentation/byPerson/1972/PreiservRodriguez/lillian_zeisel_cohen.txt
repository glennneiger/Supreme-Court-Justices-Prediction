ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
these
cases,
is
whether
state
prisoners
complaining
about
the
matter
of
their
confinement
should
be
able
to
obtain
equitable
relief
under
the
civil
rights
act
given
the
applicability
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
when
these
actions
were
commenced,
each
of
the
respondents
was
confined
in
a
state
prison.
each
was
in
custody
pursuant
to
a
valid
state
court
judgment
of
conviction.
each
have
been
deprived
of
good-conduct-time-credits
by
the
department
of
correction
as
a
result
of
a
disciplinary
action
of
each
and
each
immediately
proceeded
to
the
federal
district
court
with
a
combined
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
civil
rights
complaint.
in
each
case,
the
district
court
held
a
hearing
and
granted
relief
on
the
merits
rejecting
the
state’s
argument
that
the
actions
were
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
applications.
each
of
the
respondents
was
released
from
physical
confinement
as
a
result
of
the
district
court’s
decision.
individual
panels
of
the
second
circuit
heard
appeals
by
the
state
taken
in
all
three
cases.
the
panels
which
reviewed
rodriguez
and
katzoff
reversed
the
district
court
on
the
ground
that
the
applications
were
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
petitions
and
there
had
been
a
failure
to
exhaust
state
court
remedies.
before
kritsky
was
decided,
a
motion
to
en
banc
rodriguez
and
katzoff
was
granted
and
kritsky
was
ordered
included
in
the
en
banc
consideration.
counsel
were
directed
to
brief
and
be
prepare
to
argue
two
specific
questions
unrelated
to
the
merits
of
these
cases.
the
first
was
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
abstention
and
the
second
was
the
need
to
exhaust
state
court
remedies.
after
this
court’s
decision
in
wilwording
against
swenson,
the
circuit
court
reversed
the
panel
decisions
in
rodriguez
and
katzoff
and
affirmed
the
district
court
in
all
three
cases.
it
is
evident
from
the
eight
opinions
that
were
written
by
the
court
below
that
until
this
court
decided
wilwording.
the
second
circuit
was
evenly
divided
in
considering
this
case
by
vote
of
66
on
the
question
of
whether
the
claims
raised
should
first
have
been
presented
to
the
state
courts.
and
what’s
even
more
interesting
is
aside
form
the
diverse
opinion
--
the
division
of
opinion
between
the
members
of
the
court
is
the
fact
that
even
among
those
who
were
very
firm
in
their
belief
that
the
state
should
first
have
considered
these
claims.
there
was
no
agreement
as
to
whether
exhaustion
of
remedies
was
required
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
or
whether
exhaustion
of
remedy
should
be
required
under
the
civil
rights
act.
judges
friendly,
mansfield
and
mulligan
believe
that
these
are
all
habeas
corpus
petitions
and
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
of
section
2254
is
applicable.
judges
lumbard,
moore,
and
hayes
believe
that
these
might
be
considered
as
civil
right
actions
but
that
in
any
event,
despite
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
exhaustion
of
state
judicial
remedies
was
an
order.
after
wilwording,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
felt
that
they
were
bound
to
accept
the
inmate’s
choice
of
remedy.
and
based
upon
these
earlier
decisions
of
this
court,
held
that
exhaustion
of
state
judicial
remedies
was
not
required
in
these
cases.
petitioner
seek
reversal
of
the
decision
below
on
the
ground
that
choice
of
remedy
should
not
lay
with
the
inmate
as
it
presently
does
because
any
claim
that
he
may
raise
regarding
the
legality
of
his
custody
is
essentially
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus.
custody
is
at
the
heart
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
section
2241
says,
“the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
extend
to
a
prisoner
unless
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.”
section
2254
says,
“that
a
federal
court
shall
not
entertain
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
behalf
of
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
conviction
only
on
the
ground
that
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
make
it
clear
that
custody
as
it
is
used
in
the
statute
refers
not
simply
to
the
reason
--
the
inmate
is
being
confined,
but
to
all
the
incidents
of
confinement
as
well
wilwording
against
swenson
reaffirmed
this
in
the
context
of
the
eighth
amendment
claims
that
were
there
raised.
actually,
the
respondents
in
this
case
do
not
deny
the
validity
of
this
classification.
so
much
as
they
fear
the
application
of
the
exhaustion
requirement
of
section
2254
and
the
arguments
which
they
raised
in
reply
to
the
question
which
the
state
has
presented
to
the
court
and
which
is
really
not
so
much
the
invention
of
the
state
in
this
case
as
it
is
the
concern
of
the
circuit
court
which
en
banc
these
cases
relate
to
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
whether
or
not
there
is
any
detriment
to
the
inmate.
the
reason
which
they
emphasize
the
most
and
which
i
believe
to
be
the
least
tenable
was
that
there
will
be
a
delay
to
the
state
prisoner
in
reaching
a
federal
form.
the
reason
i
feel
that
this
is
the
least
tenable
is
that
delay
in
reaching
a
federal
court
for
a
state
prisoner
or
for
any
citizen
has
relevance
only
in
so
far
as
there
is
no
adequate
state
court
remedy.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
i
commenced
my
argument
with
the
reading
from
the
statute
of
sections
that
i
am
sure
this
bench
is
very
familiar
with.
i
think
that
initially,
the
proper
classification
of
this
case
is
determined
by
statute.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
habeas
corpus
statute.
the
essence
of
that
statute
is
custody
and
its
custody
in
the
context
of
a
state
court
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
sentence
which
follows.
therefore,
i
think
that
the
jumping
of
point
for
any
consideration
of
where
state
prisoner
claim
should
be
presented
is
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
of
course
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
i
think
that
based
upon
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we
have
passed
the
point
where
conceptually
the
habeas
corpus
statute
or
legally
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
devoted
simply
to
a
state
court
judgment
of
conviction
in
sentence.
i
think
this
court
made
that
clear
as
i
said
in
wilwording
against
swenson
in
the
context
of
eighth
amendment
claims
it
did
so
on
the
context
of
johnson
against
avery
which
raised
the
question
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
a
state
prison
regulation.
and
as
i
say,
i
don’t
believe
that
respondents
really
denied
the
appropriateness
of
this
classification
that
if
you
--
they
don’t
claim
that
these
cases
are
not
properly
habeas
corpus.
i
suppose
if
you
ask
them
which
category
they
would
prefer
to
the
end,
they
would
say
that
if
they
have
to
really
choose
one
of
the
other
--
their
choice
would
lie
with
the
civil
rights
act,
but
that
simply
because
the
decisions
of
this
court
today
are
that
the
exhaustion
of
state
judicial
remedies
would
not
be
required.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
in
the
beginning,
i
would
point
out
that
the
cases
before
this
court
do
not
raise
damage
claims.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
the
position
that
taken
by
the
state
is
not
precluded
damage
action
by
the
inmate.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
the
civil
rights
act,
habeas
corpus
is
not
a
remedy
for
damage
action
and
we
are
not
arguing
that.
i
don’t
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
not
on
the
pure
damage
question
and
we
did
not
argue
that
in
our
initial
brief
when
we
set
forth
the
way
in
which
we
believe
the
damages
could
be
handled.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
but
in
one
situation,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it’s
the
claim
that
in
the
nature
of
equitable
claims
which
should
be
properly
treated
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
because
of
the
custody
considerations
and
because
of
other
policy
considerations
as
well.
the
pure
damage
action
will
commend
in
civil
rights
act.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
a
perfect
summary
of
the
position
which
we
adopt
and
which
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
habeas
corpus
law
is
exactly
for
this
kind
of
claim.
now,
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that
they
can
and
not
only
that
but
the
damages
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
right.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
why
i
believe
that
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
hold
in
these
cases
is
not
always
revolutionary
as
counsel
for
respondents
would
suggest.
but
also
important
given
the
nature
of
prison
rights
litigation
is
the
fact
that
damages
really
play
a
very
small
part
in
prison
rights
litigation.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
that
was
about
1871,
i
think
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
history
of
either
statute
to
indicate
that
either
statute
was
intended
to
reach
these
claims
at
all.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
don’t
think
--
i
am
not
asking
this
court
to
say
that
congress
said
that
the
state
prisoner
should
go
to
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
what
i
believe
is
that
congress
did
not
create
the
situation,
which
exists
right
now.
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
to
show
that
either
of
these
statutes
should
reach
these
prison
rights
claims.
the
fact
is
that
it’s
only
within
the
last
ten
years
that
these
claims
are
considered
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
because
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
to
begin
with,
it’s
on
the
basis
of
decisions
by
this
court
that
both
of
these
remedies
have
been
held
applicable
to
these
claims.
so,
for
that
reason,
i
suggest
that
it
lies
with
this
court
to
remedy
the
situation
that
is
created.
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
either
of
these
statutes
to
preclude
the
consideration
of
challenges
to
conviction
in
sentence
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
yet
i
don’t
think
anyone
would
suggest
that
seriously
nor
with
this
court
consider
seriously
that
the
civil
rights
act
was
available
to
challenge
your
custody
in
so
far
as
your
conviction
may
have
[voice
overlap]
obtain.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
for
prisoners,
for
state
prisoners,
yes
because
i
think
that
the
state
prisoner
can
get
the
kind
of
relief
that
he
needs
and
he
can
get
a
justice
sufficiently
if
not
more
efficiently
given
the
nature
of
the
habeas
corpus
remedy
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes
and
necessarily
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no,
i
have
to
vote
--
as
i
express
the
question
initially
i
am
saying
that
in
the
context
of
claims
that
relate
to
the
legality
of
their
custody.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
or
the
incidence
of
their
custody
in
any
context.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
and
as
i
say,
you
are
not
depriving
the
inmate
of
anything
by
saying
that
he
is
restricted
to
what
is
really
the
appropriate
statute.
the
argument
that’s
relied
upon
by
respondent
as
i
indicated
before
is
the
alleged
delay
in
reaching
the
federal
form.
but,
given
adequate
state
remedies,
the
delay
is
not
a
source
of
prejudice
to
the
inmate.
in
the
case
where
you
have
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
not
at
all,
exactly.
that’s
exactly
the
standard
for
the
operation
of
section
2254.
for
example
in
wilwording
against
swenson
in
this
court
held
that
missouri
provided
no
remedies
to
state
prisoners
for
the
presentation
of
this
type
of
claim.
presumably,
if
since
the
wilwording
decision,
missouri
has
not
created
any
new
remedies
or
any
remedies
at
all.
every
state
prisoner
in
missouri
could
come
directly
to
a
federal
court
and
present
his
claims
by
way
of
habeas
corpus.
there
is
not
a
question
of
any
delay.
on
the
other
hand,
whereas
you
have
state
like
new
york
which
has
remedies,
we
believe
that
the
interest
of
a
state
and
its
responsibility
for
these
cases
require
that
the
application
of
the
section
2254
requirement
apply.
you
have
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
am
referring
to
both
remedies
here.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
administrative
remedies
would
not
apply
in
every
situation
in
any
event.
i
think
that
if
you
had
a
situation
where
an
inmate
was
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
regulation,
you
would
not
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
he
would
go
directly
to
a
court
because
it
would
not
lie
within
the
power
of
the
administrator
to
review
it.
so,
in
that
context,
the
administrative
exhaustion
would
not
result
in
any
delay
either.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
is
going
to
be
suing
the
department
of
correction
on
the
ground
that
a
regulation
was
improperly
applied
to
him,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
claim
is
not
right
until
the
department
of
correction
has
taken
some
action
with
respect
to
it.
now,
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
right.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
exactly,
well,
that’s
the
remedy
this
court
is
already
recognized
as
applicable
to
this
case.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
oh
no,
because
the
one
thing
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
clear
in
expanding
the
custody
concept
for
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
that
release
is
not
the
sole
relief
that
can
be
granted
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
the
habeas
corpus
statute
says,
“the
court
shall
deal
with
the
situation
as
law
and
justice
require.”
and
that
means
that
he
would
be
relieved
to
the
illegal
restraint
under
this
remedy.
he
need
not
be
release
from
physical
confinement,
it’s
in
the
statute.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
because
this
is
an
incident
of
custody
and
in
this
case
what
you
have
is
a
restraint
that
goes
beyond
the
legal
limits
of
the
sentence
that
have
been
imposed
by
state
court.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
the
civil
rights
act
could
not
reach
unless
there
was
a
basis
for
it
a
tenable
damage
claim
in
which
case
the
inmate
could
come
to
the
federal
court
to
[voice
overlap].
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no,
it’s
not.
on
the
other
hand
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
on
the
other
hand,
you
are
dealing
with
a
situation
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
the
--
well,
the
view
we
take
is
that
habeas
corpus
is
actually
a
better
remedy
than
the
injunctive
proceeding
because
presumably
the
inmate
would
come
in
and
seek
a
preliminary
injunction
under
the
civil
rights
act
so
that
he
would
get
his
food.
but,
the
habeas
corpus
statute
would
provide
him
with
just
as
expeditious
review
and
it
would
give
him
a
final
determination
expeditiously.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
oh
yes!
because
the
statute
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
excuse
me?
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
there
is
--
it
depends
why
are
you
talking
his
--
about
filing
his
habeas
corpus.
for
example
in
new
york,
new
york
has
an
injunctive
remedy.
if
this
inmate
who
is
not
getting
his
food
in
new
york
went
into
court,
under
the
injunctive
remedy
specifically
applicable
to
constitutional
claims
raised
by
state
prisoners,
he
could
get
his
injunctive
relief
right
under
that
statute.
it’s
designed
to
reach
that
kind
of
claim.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
and
that’s
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
my
point
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
it.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no,
there’s
a
final
habeas
corpus.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
because
when
he
comes
into
federal
court
on
a
habeas
corpus
petition,
the
statute
--
the
habeas
corpus
statute
requires
that
that
application
be
expeditiously
decided.
unlike
the
civil
rights
act
where
there
is
no
legal
injunctions
in
the
statute
that
the
action
has
to
be
specifically
decided.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
but
that
only
assumes
that
state
remedies
are
inadequate
and
what
i’ve
been
referring
to
now
is
an
injunction
proceeding
that’s
available
by
statutes
specifically
to
this
type
of
claim.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
it
is.
it
was
enacted
as
a
matter
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
but
provided
for
a
state
law
enacted.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
he
would
have
to
and
but
in
that
respect
it
wouldn’t
be
any
different
than
if
he
were
a
federal
prisoner
before
he
can
come
in
to
a
court,
any
court
or
federal
court
and
seek
and
any
relief
from
his
confinement
must
pursue
his
administrative
remedies.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
he
can’t
come
in
under
1983
because
if
he
is
suing
a
federal
administrator
if
there
is
no
state
action.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
we
are
saying
that
if
there
are
administrative
remedies
available,
that
the
inmate
who
was
being
deprived
of
food.
suppose
you
have
a
situation
of
a
very
vindictive
warden
as
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested
that
he
will
give
food
to
redheads.
there’s
nothing
to
prevent
the
correction
of
that
by
the
commissioner
of
the
department
of
correction
upon
an
appropriate
appeal.
the
case
meant
never
reach
a
federal
court
based
upon
that
assumption.
but
in
any
event
and
as
i
say,
if
this
were
a
federal
prisoner
who
had
the
same
grievance
against
his
warden,
he
would
have
to
pursue
that
remedy
before
he
could
come
to
a
federal
court
for
an
injunctive
relief
and
that
is
a
disparity
which
respondents
have
never
answered
except
to
say
that
section
1983
doesn’t
apply
to
the
federal
prisoner.
why
is
it
so
much
more
onerous
for
a
state
prisoner
to
have
to
exhaust
available
administrative
remedies
which
really
go
to
the
rightness
of
the
claim?
and
that
is
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
that’s
what
i
am
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
in
this
case
because
to
the
extent
that
1983
has
been
extended
to
state
prisoners
for
purposes
of
equitable
relief.
that
seems
to
me
that
that’s
an
inappropriate
extension
and
that
it
should
be
withdrawing.
now,
the
respondents
cite
figures
that
our
contention
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that
habeas
corpus
is
the
appropriate
statute.
it
deals
with
custody
and
it
deals
with
state
prisoner’s
custody.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
right
and
you’re
not
depriving
him
of
anything,
you
are
giving
him
an
expeditious
remedy.
a
remedy
which
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
works
more
quickly
for
him
in
terms
of
getting
him
relief
and
places
less
of
a
burden
on
the
[voice

--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
the
preliminary
injunction,
one
disadvantage
that
i
see
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
but
that
assumes
a
sophistication
on
the
part
of
the
inmate
to
seek
a
preliminary
injunction
based
upon
my
experience
if
i
may
refer
to
that.
i
have
yet
to
see
a
pro
se
application
for
preliminary
injunction.
they
initially
will
follow,
there
maybe
in
cases
where
counsel
is
representing
the
petitioner.
but
in
pro
se
cases,
they
will
file
a
civil
rights
complaint.
they
will
ask
for
their
relief.
it
will
be
treated
the
way
any
other
civil
complaint
is
treated.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
the
disadvantage
that
i
see
is
that
you
get
bifurcated
decision.
if
you
do
this
under
the
civil
rights
act,
you
go
and
then
you
get
a
preliminary
injunction
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
then
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
and
then
you
have
to
get
it
in
underlying
a
final
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
validity
to
the
claim.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
he
is
eating.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no,
my
point
is
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
but
there
is
not
reason
why
habeas
corpus
can’t
result
in
the
speedy
decision
and
in
fact
i
think
it
does.
given
the
emergency
situation
which
[voice

ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
twenty
days,
but
i
will
say
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
--
now
habeas
corpus
is
an
emergency
remedy
that’
the
concept
that
[voice
overlap].
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
as
a
practical
matter,
these
are
civil
rights
actions
and
these
are
extensively
the
actions
before
this
court
now
where
emergency
actions
too
and
yet
there
was
no
decision
in
these
cases
for
and
one
of
these
case
for
10
months
with
passed
by
a
long
shot
the
time
in
which
the
man
involved
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
be
release.
so,
that’s
not
so
clear
that
under
the
civil
rights
act
is
going
to
be
a
more
expeditious
remedy.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
suppose
we
were
to
take
the
preliminary
injunction
hypothetical
in
the
context
of
good
time
basis.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
a
temporary
restraining
order,
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
there’s
nothing
to
preclude
the
operation
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
that
way.
there
is
nothing
that
says
that
the
judge
has
to
wait
for
a
response
from
the
state
and
in
fact
in
upstate
new
york,
typically
that
state
is
not
putting
any
opposition
in
these
cases.
they
are
decided
right
off
the
cuff
by
the
judge
to
whom
the
petition
is
proceeded.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
and
based
upon
the
experience
that
i
have
seen
in
my
office
and
virtually
every
habeas
corpus
application
upstate
and
probably
the
reason
we
windup
with
so
many
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
is
the
fact
that
we
never
put
in
a
response
upstate.
those
judges
get
the
petitions
and
they
decide
them
without
any
response
from
the
state.
so,
there
is
no
uniform
[voice
overlap].
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
the
very
study
that
was
cited
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
don’t
have
specific
figures
except
that
the
study
that
cited
by
respondent
indicates
that
in
some
cases
the
averages
of
four
months
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
it
can’t
be
sooner
and
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it
can
be
later.
the
average
in
the
ordinary
civil
rights
action
has
no
comparison,
it’s
much
slower.
the
reason
that
petitioners
are
urging
this
court
to
hold
that
an
exhaustion
requirement
is
applicable
is
because
it
is
--
it
places
the
responsibility
with
the
state
which
is
where
i
belong.
it’s
the
state
court
which
placed
these
people
in
custody.
it’s
the
state
which
should
decide
the
limits
and
the
incidence
of
the
sentences
it
imposes.
the
good-conduct-cases
are
perfect
example
of
this
because
as
we
heard
in
the
prior
case
considered
by
this
court
today,
things
like
good
time
parole
eligibility,
all
enter
into
the
sentencing
process.
there
is
a
direct
relationship
there
between
sentences
has
imposed
by
state
court
and
how
sentence
is
carried
out.
it’s
in
that
situation
that
we
think
that
the
state
court
have
the
responsibility
to
decide
on
these
cases
first.
another
example,
our
case
is
involving
the
place
of
confinement
where
a
man
is
claiming
that,
“i
should
not
be
in
a
state
prison,
i
should
be
in
a
hospital
or
i
should
be
in
the
narcotics
addiction
control
center.”
here,
you
are
talking
about
the
very
justification
for
sentence
and
you
are
talking
about
something
where
the
responsibility
lies
with
the
state
courts
which
impose
these
sentences.
and
similarly,
the
reason
--
another
reason
for
requiring
this
is
that
the
state
is
regulating
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
inmate’s
confinement.
unlike,
any
comparable
situation
for
the
ordinary
citizen
you
have
the
state,
a
situation
where
virtually
every
action
which
is
taken
with
respect
to
the
inmate
is
state
action
and
lends
itself
to
litigation.
if
there
is
no
exhaustion
requirement,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
these
cases
and
there
are
going
to
have
to
become
involved
in
this
very
complex
regulatory
scheme.
the
need
to
have
some
guidelines
for
considering
these
cases,
i
think
was
expressed
with
great
urgency
by
the
court
below.
and
i
think
that
they
are
asking
this
court
for
guidance
and
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
their
problem
lies
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute
not
with
congress,
but
with
the
statute
which
is
already
on
the
books
and
which
is
applicable
and
that
cases
challenging
conditions
of
confinement
no
less
than
cases
challenging
conviction
share
a
common
denominator
which
is
custody
and
that
they
belong
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
believe
i
have
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
okay,
that’s
fine.
there
are
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
reply
to.
first,
contrary
to
what
counsel
has
suggested,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
the
wilwording
decision.
the
specific
holding
of
wilwording
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
position.
the
claims
there
were
habeas
corpus
claims,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
exhaustion
requirement
applied
and
this
court
held
that
the
claims
were
recognizable
as
habeas
corpus
claims
and
in
fact
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
applied.
it
is
the
dictum
in
wilwording
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
and
just
as
a
point
of
interest,
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court
that
in
the
wilwording,
on
the
remand
despite
the
dictum
of
this
court,
the
parties
and
the
court
are
still
considering
these
cases
as
habeas
corpus
petitions
because
of
the
res
judicata
problem.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
reply
to
is
the
figures
that
were
cited
by
counsel
with
regard
to
the
numbers
of
cases
that
are
being
brought
in
the
federal
courts
right
now.
the
fact
is
that
the
figures
cited
in
the
american
bar
association
study
seem
to
show
a
drop
in
the
rate
of
increase
of
prisoner’s
civil
rights
actions.
and
to
me
that
suggests
a
real
--
a
substantial
reply
to
the
concern
of
counsel
for
respondents
that
these
claims
are
not
being
reviewed.
prison
conditions
have
not
changed
overnight,
the
prison
population
has
not
decreased
overnight
and
yet
there
are
less
of
these
claims
coming
in
to
the
federal
courts
in
the
last
two
years.
then
must
be
being
decided
some
place
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
happening
is
that
in
line
with
the
change
that
has
been
reflected
in
recent
decisions,
it’s
not
only
the
federal
courts
but
also
of
the
state
courts.
you
are
getting
prison
conditions
corrected
by
state
administrators
and
or
by
state
courts
and
i
think
that’s
a
response
to
the
exhaustion
object
that’s
being
raised
today.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
not
at
all.
and
i
don’t
believe
that
in
any
point
in
these
cases
we
have
argued
that
the
numbers
of
cases
is
illegal
justification
for
action.
at
most,
we
have
suggested
that
as
a
consequence
of
the
approach
which
we
suggest,
there
maybe
a
reduction
in
the
numbers
of
cases
brought.
but
that
strictly
fall
out.
that’s
not
a
legal
argument.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
think
very
clearly,
it
has
the
right
--
at
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
i
think
it
has
to
be
considered
a
mixed
question
because
you
are
talking
about
constitutional
rights
and
the
right
to
[voice
overlap].
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
and
you
are
talking
about
the
right
to
present
these
claims
and
obtain
review
and
i
think
that
that’s
a
constitutional
question.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
only
if
they
were
able
to
meet
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
requirement
for
general
litigants.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
they
wouldn’t
have
any
recourse
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
they
could.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
don’t
see
that
it
has
to
amend
the
habeas
corpus
act.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
but
as
i
think
i
indicated
earlier
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
congress
has
not
brought
us
to
the
point
that
we
are
at,
it’s
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
and
i
think
that
that’s
what
lies
with
this
court
to
resolve
the
problem
and
give
guidance
to
the
fact
why
federal
courts
have
to
handle
these
cases.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
think
that
activity
would
require
a
further
action
by
the
state
in
light
of
the
arguments
that
we’ve
made
today.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
i
think
what
they
have
done
is
emphasized
the
relevance
of
how
the
statute
should
be
construed.
i
say
that
not
to
avoid
this
question.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
legal
justification,
no.
no.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
these
cases,
is
whether
state
prisoners
complaining
about
the
matter
of
their
confinement
should
be
able
to
obtain
equitable
relief
under
the
civil
rights
act
given
the
applicability
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
when
these
actions
were
commenced,
each
of
the
respondents
was
confined
in
a
state
prison.
each
was
in
custody
pursuant
to
a
valid
state
court
judgment
of
conviction.
each
have
been
deprived
of
good-conduct-time-credits
by
the
department
of
correction
as
a
result
of
a
disciplinary
action
of
each
and
each
immediately
proceeded
to
the
federal
district
court
with
a
combined
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
civil
rights
complaint.
in
each
case,
the
district
court
held
a
hearing
and
granted
relief
on
the
merits
rejecting
the
state’s
argument
that
the
actions
were
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
applications.
each
of
the
respondents
was
released
from
physical
confinement
as
a
result
of
the
district
court’s
decision.
individual
panels
of
the
second
circuit
heard
appeals
by
the
state
taken
in
all
three
cases.
the
panels
which
reviewed
rodriguez
and
katzoff
reversed
the
district
court
on
the
ground
that
the
applications
were
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
petitions
and
there
had
been
a
failure
to
exhaust
state
court
remedies.
before
kritsky
was
decided,
a
motion
to
en
banc
rodriguez
and
katzoff
was
granted
and
kritsky
was
ordered
included
in
the
en
banc
consideration.
counsel
were
directed
to
brief
and
be
prepare
to
argue
two
specific
questions
unrelated
to
the
merits
of
these
cases.
the
first
was
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
abstention
and
the
second
was
the
need
to
exhaust
state
court
remedies.
after
this
court’s
decision
in
wilwording
against
swenson,
the
circuit
court
reversed
the
panel
decisions
in
rodriguez
and
katzoff
and
affirmed
the
district
court
in
all
three
cases.
it
is
evident
from
the
eight
opinions
that
were
written
by
the
court
below
that
until
this
court
decided
wilwording.
the
second
circuit
was
evenly
divided
in
considering
this
case
by
vote
of
66
on
the
question
of
whether
the
claims
raised
should
first
have
been
presented
to
the
state
courts.
and
what’s
even
more
interesting
is
aside
form
the
diverse
opinion
--
the
division
of
opinion
between
the
members
of
the
court
is
the
fact
that
even
among
those
who
were
very
firm
in
their
belief
that
the
state
should
first
have
considered
these
claims.
there
was
no
agreement
as
to
whether
exhaustion
of
remedies
was
required
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
or
whether
exhaustion
of
remedy
should
be
required
under
the
civil
rights
act.
judges
friendly,
mansfield
and
mulligan
believe
that
these
are
all
habeas
corpus
petitions
and
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
of
section
2254
is
applicable.
judges
lumbard,
moore,
and
hayes
believe
that
these
might
be
considered
as
civil
right
actions
but
that
in
any
event,
despite
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
exhaustion
of
state
judicial
remedies
was
an
order.
after
wilwording,
a
majority
of
the
court
below
felt
that
they
were
bound
to
accept
the
inmate’s
choice
of
remedy.
and
based
upon
these
earlier
decisions
of
this
court,
held
that
exhaustion
of
state
judicial
remedies
was
not
required
in
these
cases.
petitioner
seek
reversal
of
the
decision
below
on
the
ground
that
choice
of
remedy
should
not
lay
with
the
inmate
as
it
presently
does
because
any
claim
that
he
may
raise
regarding
the
legality
of
his
custody
is
essentially
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus.
custody
is
at
the
heart
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
section
2241
says,
“the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
extend
to
a
prisoner
unless
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.”
section
2254
says,
“that
a
federal
court
shall
not
entertain
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
behalf
of
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
conviction
only
on
the
ground
that
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
make
it
clear
that
custody
as
it
is
used
in
the
statute
refers
not
simply
to
the
reason
--
the
inmate
is
being
confined,
but
to
all
the
incidents
of
confinement
as
well
wilwording
against
swenson
reaffirmed
this
in
the
context
of
the
eighth
amendment
claims
that
were
there
raised.
actually,
the
respondents
in
this
case
do
not
deny
the
validity
of
this
classification.
so
much
as
they
fear
the
application
of
the
exhaustion
requirement
of
section
2254
and
the
arguments
which
they
raised
in
reply
to
the
question
which
the
state
has
presented
to
the
court
and
which
is
really
not
so
much
the
invention
of
the
state
in
this
case
as
it
is
the
concern
of
the
circuit
court
which
en
banc
these
cases
relate
to
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
whether
or
not
there
is
any
detriment
to
the
inmate.
the
reason
which
they
emphasize
the
most
and
which
i
believe
to
be
the
least
tenable
was
that
there
will
be
a
delay
to
the
state
prisoner
in
reaching
a
federal
form.
the
reason
i
feel
that
this
is
the
least
tenable
is
that
delay
in
reaching
a
federal
court
for
a
state
prisoner
or
for
any
citizen
has
relevance
only
in
so
far
as
there
is
no
adequate
state
court
remedy.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
i
commenced
my
argument
with
the
reading
from
the
statute
of
sections
that
i
am
sure
this
bench
is
very
familiar
with.
i
think
that
initially,
the
proper
classification
of
this
case
is
determined
by
statute.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
habeas
corpus
statute.
the
essence
of
that
statute
is
custody
and
its
custody
in
the
context
of
a
state
court
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
sentence
which
follows.
therefore,
i
think
that
the
jumping
of
point
for
any
consideration
of
where
state
prisoner
claim
should
be
presented
is
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
of
course
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
i
think
that
based
upon
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we
have
passed
the
point
where
conceptually
the
habeas
corpus
statute
or
legally
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
devoted
simply
to
a
state
court
judgment
of
conviction
in
sentence.
i
think
this
court
made
that
clear
as
i
said
in
wilwording
against
swenson
in
the
context
of
eighth
amendment
claims
it
did
so
on
the
context
of
johnson
against
avery
which
raised
the
question
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
a
state
prison
regulation.
and
as
i
say,
i
don’t
believe
that
respondents
really
denied
the
appropriateness
of
this
classification
that
if
you
--
they
don’t
claim
that
these
cases
are
not
properly
habeas
corpus.
i
suppose
if
you
ask
them
which
category
they
would
prefer
to
the
end,
they
would
say
that
if
they
have
to
really
choose
one
of
the
other
--
their
choice
would
lie
with
the
civil
rights
act,
but
that
simply
because
the
decisions
of
this
court
today
are
that
the
exhaustion
of
state
judicial
remedies
would
not
be
required.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
in
the
beginning,
i
would
point
out
that
the
cases
before
this
court
do
not
raise
damage
claims.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
the
position
that
taken
by
the
state
is
not
precluded
damage
action
by
the
inmate.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
the
civil
rights
act,
habeas
corpus
is
not
a
remedy
for
damage
action
and
we
are
not
arguing
that.
i
don’t
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
not
on
the
pure
damage
question
and
we
did
not
argue
that
in
our
initial
brief
when
we
set
forth
the
way
in
which
we
believe
the
damages
could
be
handled.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
but
in
one
situation,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it’s
the
claim
that
in
the
nature
of
equitable
claims
which
should
be
properly
treated
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute
because
of
the
custody
considerations
and
because
of
other
policy
considerations
as
well.
the
pure
damage
action
will
commend
in
civil
rights
act.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
a
perfect
summary
of
the
position
which
we
adopt
and
which
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
habeas
corpus
law
is
exactly
for
this
kind
of
claim.
now,
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that
they
can
and
not
only
that
but
the
damages
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
right.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
why
i
believe
that
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
hold
in
these
cases
is
not
always
revolutionary
as
counsel
for
respondents
would
suggest.
but
also
important
given
the
nature
of
prison
rights
litigation
is
the
fact
that
damages
really
play
a
very
small
part
in
prison
rights
litigation.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
that
was
about
1871,
i
think
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
history
of
either
statute
to
indicate
that
either
statute
was
intended
to
reach
these
claims
at
all.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
don’t
think
--
i
am
not
asking
this
court
to
say
that
congress
said
that
the
state
prisoner
should
go
to
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
what
i
believe
is
that
congress
did
not
create
the
situation,
which
exists
right
now.
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
to
show
that
either
of
these
statutes
should
reach
these
prison
rights
claims.
the
fact
is
that
it’s
only
within
the
last
ten
years
that
these
claims
are
considered
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
because
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
to
begin
with,
it’s
on
the
basis
of
decisions
by
this
court
that
both
of
these
remedies
have
been
held
applicable
to
these
claims.
so,
for
that
reason,
i
suggest
that
it
lies
with
this
court
to
remedy
the
situation
that
is
created.
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
either
of
these
statutes
to
preclude
the
consideration
of
challenges
to
conviction
in
sentence
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
yet
i
don’t
think
anyone
would
suggest
that
seriously
nor
with
this
court
consider
seriously
that
the
civil
rights
act
was
available
to
challenge
your
custody
in
so
far
as
your
conviction
may
have
[voice
overlap]
obtain.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
for
prisoners,
for
state
prisoners,
yes
because
i
think
that
the
state
prisoner
can
get
the
kind
of
relief
that
he
needs
and
he
can
get
a
justice
sufficiently
if
not
more
efficiently
given
the
nature
of
the
habeas
corpus
remedy
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes
and
necessarily
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no,
i
have
to
vote
--
as
i
express
the
question
initially
i
am
saying
that
in
the
context
of
claims
that
relate
to
the
legality
of
their
custody.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
or
the
incidence
of
their
custody
in
any
context.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
and
as
i
say,
you
are
not
depriving
the
inmate
of
anything
by
saying
that
he
is
restricted
to
what
is
really
the
appropriate
statute.
the
argument
that’s
relied
upon
by
respondent
as
i
indicated
before
is
the
alleged
delay
in
reaching
the
federal
form.
but,
given
adequate
state
remedies,
the
delay
is
not
a
source
of
prejudice
to
the
inmate.
in
the
case
where
you
have
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
not
at
all,
exactly.
that’s
exactly
the
standard
for
the
operation
of
section
2254.
for
example
in
wilwording
against
swenson
in
this
court
held
that
missouri
provided
no
remedies
to
state
prisoners
for
the
presentation
of
this
type
of
claim.
presumably,
if
since
the
wilwording
decision,
missouri
has
not
created
any
new
remedies
or
any
remedies
at
all.
every
state
prisoner
in
missouri
could
come
directly
to
a
federal
court
and
present
his
claims
by
way
of
habeas
corpus.
there
is
not
a
question
of
any
delay.
on
the
other
hand,
whereas
you
have
state
like
new
york
which
has
remedies,
we
believe
that
the
interest
of
a
state
and
its
responsibility
for
these
cases
require
that
the
application
of
the
section
2254
requirement
apply.
you
have
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
am
referring
to
both
remedies
here.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
administrative
remedies
would
not
apply
in
every
situation
in
any
event.
i
think
that
if
you
had
a
situation
where
an
inmate
was
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
regulation,
you
would
not
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
he
would
go
directly
to
a
court
because
it
would
not
lie
within
the
power
of
the
administrator
to
review
it.
so,
in
that
context,
the
administrative
exhaustion
would
not
result
in
any
delay
either.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
is
going
to
be
suing
the
department
of
correction
on
the
ground
that
a
regulation
was
improperly
applied
to
him,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
claim
is
not
right
until
the
department
of
correction
has
taken
some
action
with
respect
to
it.
now,
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
right.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
exactly,
well,
that’s
the
remedy
this
court
is
already
recognized
as
applicable
to
this
case.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
oh
no,
because
the
one
thing
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
clear
in
expanding
the
custody
concept
for
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
that
release
is
not
the
sole
relief
that
can
be
granted
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
the
habeas
corpus
statute
says,
“the
court
shall
deal
with
the
situation
as
law
and
justice
require.”
and
that
means
that
he
would
be
relieved
to
the
illegal
restraint
under
this
remedy.
he
need
not
be
release
from
physical
confinement,
it’s
in
the
statute.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
because
this
is
an
incident
of
custody
and
in
this
case
what
you
have
is
a
restraint
that
goes
beyond
the
legal
limits
of
the
sentence
that
have
been
imposed
by
state
court.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
the
civil
rights
act
could
not
reach
unless
there
was
a
basis
for
it
a
tenable
damage
claim
in
which
case
the
inmate
could
come
to
the
federal
court
to
[voice
overlap].
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no,
it’s
not.
on
the
other
hand
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
on
the
other
hand,
you
are
dealing
with
a
situation
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
the
--
well,
the
view
we
take
is
that
habeas
corpus
is
actually
a
better
remedy
than
the
injunctive
proceeding
because
presumably
the
inmate
would
come
in
and
seek
a
preliminary
injunction
under
the
civil
rights
act
so
that
he
would
get
his
food.
but,
the
habeas
corpus
statute
would
provide
him
with
just
as
expeditious
review
and
it
would
give
him
a
final
determination
expeditiously.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
oh
yes!
because
the
statute
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
excuse
me?
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
there
is
--
it
depends
why
are
you
talking
his
--
about
filing
his
habeas
corpus.
for
example
in
new
york,
new
york
has
an
injunctive
remedy.
if
this
inmate
who
is
not
getting
his
food
in
new
york
went
into
court,
under
the
injunctive
remedy
specifically
applicable
to
constitutional
claims
raised
by
state
prisoners,
he
could
get
his
injunctive
relief
right
under
that
statute.
it’s
designed
to
reach
that
kind
of
claim.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
and
that’s
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
my
point
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
it.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no,
there’s
a
final
habeas
corpus.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
because
when
he
comes
into
federal
court
on
a
habeas
corpus
petition,
the
statute
--
the
habeas
corpus
statute
requires
that
that
application
be
expeditiously
decided.
unlike
the
civil
rights
act
where
there
is
no
legal
injunctions
in
the
statute
that
the
action
has
to
be
specifically
decided.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
but
that
only
assumes
that
state
remedies
are
inadequate
and
what
i’ve
been
referring
to
now
is
an
injunction
proceeding
that’s
available
by
statutes
specifically
to
this
type
of
claim.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
it
is.
it
was
enacted
as
a
matter
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
but
provided
for
a
state
law
enacted.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
he
would
have
to
and
but
in
that
respect
it
wouldn’t
be
any
different
than
if
he
were
a
federal
prisoner
before
he
can
come
in
to
a
court,
any
court
or
federal
court
and
seek
and
any
relief
from
his
confinement
must
pursue
his
administrative
remedies.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
he
can’t
come
in
under
1983
because
if
he
is
suing
a
federal
administrator
if
there
is
no
state
action.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
we
are
saying
that
if
there
are
administrative
remedies
available,
that
the
inmate
who
was
being
deprived
of
food.
suppose
you
have
a
situation
of
a
very
vindictive
warden
as
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested
that
he
will
give
food
to
redheads.
there’s
nothing
to
prevent
the
correction
of
that
by
the
commissioner
of
the
department
of
correction
upon
an
appropriate
appeal.
the
case
meant
never
reach
a
federal
court
based
upon
that
assumption.
but
in
any
event
and
as
i
say,
if
this
were
a
federal
prisoner
who
had
the
same
grievance
against
his
warden,
he
would
have
to
pursue
that
remedy
before
he
could
come
to
a
federal
court
for
an
injunctive
relief
and
that
is
a
disparity
which
respondents
have
never
answered
except
to
say
that
section
1983
doesn’t
apply
to
the
federal
prisoner.
why
is
it
so
much
more
onerous
for
a
state
prisoner
to
have
to
exhaust
available
administrative
remedies
which
really
go
to
the
rightness
of
the
claim?
and
that
is
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
that’s
what
i
am
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
in
this
case
because
to
the
extent
that
1983
has
been
extended
to
state
prisoners
for
purposes
of
equitable
relief.
that
seems
to
me
that
that’s
an
inappropriate
extension
and
that
it
should
be
withdrawing.
now,
the
respondents
cite
figures
that
our
contention
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that
habeas
corpus
is
the
appropriate
statute.
it
deals
with
custody
and
it
deals
with
state
prisoner’s
custody.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
that’s
right
and
you’re
not
depriving
him
of
anything,
you
are
giving
him
an
expeditious
remedy.
a
remedy
which
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
works
more
quickly
for
him
in
terms
of
getting
him
relief
and
places
less
of
a
burden
on
the
[voice

--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
the
preliminary
injunction,
one
disadvantage
that
i
see
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
but
that
assumes
a
sophistication
on
the
part
of
the
inmate
to
seek
a
preliminary
injunction
based
upon
my
experience
if
i
may
refer
to
that.
i
have
yet
to
see
a
pro
se
application
for
preliminary
injunction.
they
initially
will
follow,
there
maybe
in
cases
where
counsel
is
representing
the
petitioner.
but
in
pro
se
cases,
they
will
file
a
civil
rights
complaint.
they
will
ask
for
their
relief.
it
will
be
treated
the
way
any
other
civil
complaint
is
treated.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
the
disadvantage
that
i
see
is
that
you
get
bifurcated
decision.
if
you
do
this
under
the
civil
rights
act,
you
go
and
then
you
get
a
preliminary
injunction
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
then
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
and
then
you
have
to
get
it
in
underlying
a
final
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
validity
to
the
claim.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
he
is
eating.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no,
my
point
is
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
but
there
is
not
reason
why
habeas
corpus
can’t
result
in
the
speedy
decision
and
in
fact
i
think
it
does.
given
the
emergency
situation
which

ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
twenty
days,
but
i
will
say
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
no
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
--
now
habeas
corpus
is
an
emergency
remedy
that’
the
concept
that
[voice
overlap].
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
as
a
practical
matter,
these
are
civil
rights
actions
and
these
are
extensively
the
actions
before
this
court
now
where
emergency
actions
too
and
yet
there
was
no
decision
in
these
cases
for
and
one
of
these
case
for
10
months
with
passed
by
a
long
shot
the
time
in
which
the
man
involved
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
be
release.
so,
that’s
not
so
clear
that
under
the
civil
rights
act
is
going
to
be
a
more
expeditious
remedy.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
suppose
we
were
to
take
the
preliminary
injunction
hypothetical
in
the
context
of
good
time
basis.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
a
temporary
restraining
order,
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
there’s
nothing
to
preclude
the
operation
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
that
way.
there
is
nothing
that
says
that
the
judge
has
to
wait
for
a
response
from
the
state
and
in
fact
in
upstate
new
york,
typically
that
state
is
not
putting
any
opposition
in
these
cases.
they
are
decided
right
off
the
cuff
by
the
judge
to
whom
the
petition
is
proceeded.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
and
based
upon
the
experience
that
i
have
seen
in
my
office
and
virtually
every
habeas
corpus
application
upstate
and
probably
the
reason
we
windup
with
so
many
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
is
the
fact
that
we
never
put
in
a
response
upstate.
those
judges
get
the
petitions
and
they
decide
them
without
any
response
from
the
state.
so,
there
is
no
uniform
[voice
overlap].
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
the
very
study
that
was
cited
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
don’t
have
specific
figures
except
that
the
study
that
cited
by
respondent
indicates
that
in
some
cases
the
averages
of
four
months
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
it
can’t
be
sooner
and
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it
can
be
later.
the
average
in
the
ordinary
civil
rights
action
has
no
comparison,
it’s
much
slower.
the
reason
that
petitioners
are
urging
this
court
to
hold
that
an
exhaustion
requirement
is
applicable
is
because
it
is
--
it
places
the
responsibility
with
the
state
which
is
where
i
belong.
it’s
the
state
court
which
placed
these
people
in
custody.
it’s
the
state
which
should
decide
the
limits
and
the
incidence
of
the
sentences
it
imposes.
the
good-conduct-cases
are
perfect
example
of
this
because
as
we
heard
in
the
prior
case
considered
by
this
court
today,
things
like
good
time
parole
eligibility,
all
enter
into
the
sentencing
process.
there
is
a
direct
relationship
there
between
sentences
has
imposed
by
state
court
and
how
sentence
is
carried
out.
it’s
in
that
situation
that
we
think
that
the
state
court
have
the
responsibility
to
decide
on
these
cases
first.
another
example,
our
case
is
involving
the
place
of
confinement
where
a
man
is
claiming
that,
“i
should
not
be
in
a
state
prison,
i
should
be
in
a
hospital
or
i
should
be
in
the
narcotics
addiction
control
center.”
here,
you
are
talking
about
the
very
justification
for
sentence
and
you
are
talking
about
something
where
the
responsibility
lies
with
the
state
courts
which
impose
these
sentences.
and
similarly,
the
reason
--
another
reason
for
requiring
this
is
that
the
state
is
regulating
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
inmate’s
confinement.
unlike,
any
comparable
situation
for
the
ordinary
citizen
you
have
the
state,
a
situation
where
virtually
every
action
which
is
taken
with
respect
to
the
inmate
is
state
action
and
lends
itself
to
litigation.
if
there
is
no
exhaustion
requirement,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
these
cases
and
there
are
going
to
have
to
become
involved
in
this
very
complex
regulatory
scheme.
the
need
to
have
some
guidelines
for
considering
these
cases,
i
think
was
expressed
with
great
urgency
by
the
court
below.
and
i
think
that
they
are
asking
this
court
for
guidance
and
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
their
problem
lies
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute
not
with
congress,
but
with
the
statute
which
is
already
on
the
books
and
which
is
applicable
and
that
cases
challenging
conditions
of
confinement
no
less
than
cases
challenging
conviction
share
a
common
denominator
which
is
custody
and
that
they
belong
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
believe
i
have
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
okay,
that’s
fine.
there
are
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
reply
to.
first,
contrary
to
what
counsel
has
suggested,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
the
wilwording
decision.
the
specific
holding
of
wilwording
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
position.
the
claims
there
were
habeas
corpus
claims,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
exhaustion
requirement
applied
and
this
court
held
that
the
claims
were
recognizable
as
habeas
corpus
claims
and
in
fact
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
applied.
it
is
the
dictum
in
wilwording
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
and
just
as
a
point
of
interest,
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court
that
in
the
wilwording,
on
the
remand
despite
the
dictum
of
this
court,
the
parties
and
the
court
are
still
considering
these
cases
as
habeas
corpus
petitions
because
of
the
res
judicata
problem.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
reply
to
is
the
figures
that
were
cited
by
counsel
with
regard
to
the
numbers
of
cases
that
are
being
brought
in
the
federal
courts
right
now.
the
fact
is
that
the
figures
cited
in
the
american
bar
association
study
seem
to
show
a
drop
in
the
rate
of
increase
of
prisoner’s
civil
rights
actions.
and
to
me
that
suggests
a
real
--
a
substantial
reply
to
the
concern
of
counsel
for
respondents
that
these
claims
are
not
being
reviewed.
prison
conditions
have
not
changed
overnight,
the
prison
population
has
not
decreased
overnight
and
yet
there
are
less
of
these
claims
coming
in
to
the
federal
courts
in
the
last
two
years.
then
must
be
being
decided
some
place
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
happening
is
that
in
line
with
the
change
that
has
been
reflected
in
recent
decisions,
it’s
not
only
the
federal
courts
but
also
of
the
state
courts.
you
are
getting
prison
conditions
corrected
by
state
administrators
and
or
by
state
courts
and
i
think
that’s
a
response
to
the
exhaustion
object
that’s
being
raised
today.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
not
at
all.
and
i
don’t
believe
that
in
any
point
in
these
cases
we
have
argued
that
the
numbers
of
cases
is
illegal
justification
for
action.
at
most,
we
have
suggested
that
as
a
consequence
of
the
approach
which
we
suggest,
there
maybe
a
reduction
in
the
numbers
of
cases
brought.
but
that
strictly
fall
out.
that’s
not
a
legal
argument.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
think
very
clearly,
it
has
the
right
--
at
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
i
think
it
has
to
be
considered
a
mixed
question
because
you
are
talking
about
constitutional
rights
and
the
right
to
[voice
overlap].
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
and
you
are
talking
about
the
right
to
present
these
claims
and
obtain
review
and
i
think
that
that’s
a
constitutional
question.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
only
if
they
were
able
to
meet
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
requirement
for
general
litigants.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
they
wouldn’t
have
any
recourse
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
they
could.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
don’t
see
that
it
has
to
amend
the
habeas
corpus
act.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes,
but
as
i
think
i
indicated
earlier
--
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
congress
has
not
brought
us
to
the
point
that
we
are
at,
it’s
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
and
i
think
that
that’s
what
lies
with
this
court
to
resolve
the
problem
and
give
guidance
to
the
fact
why
federal
courts
have
to
handle
these
cases.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
think
that
activity
would
require
a
further
action
by
the
state
in
light
of
the
arguments
that
we’ve
made
today.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
well,
i
think
what
they
have
done
is
emphasized
the
relevance
of
how
the
statute
should
be
construed.
i
say
that
not
to
avoid
this
question.
ms.
lillian
z.
cohen
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
legal
justification,
no.
no.
