mr.
herman
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
if
i
may
to
take
a
minute
or
two,
to
give
some
of
the
facts
underlying
these
cases.
because
although
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
the
jurisdictional
issue,
the
only
issue
on
which
cert
was
granted.
the
lower
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
en
banc
decision
affirmed
all
three
cases
on
the
merits.
and
the
merits
were
argued
in
several
bound.
but
the
first
two
cases,
kritsky
and
rodriguez
involved
very
serious
disciplinary
due
process
issues
in
which
men
were
denied
good
time
on
cases
which
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court
found
were
grossly
deficient
procedures.
mr.
katzoff
who
received
relief
very
quickly
by
the
way
was
punished
with
60
days
good
time
loss
and
60
days
in
a
solitary
confinement
for
writing
two
mildly
with
derogatory
comments,
“creep
and
cigar-smoking
s.
o.
b.”
in
diaries
which
he
did
not
circulate
and
which
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
found
every
institution
in
which
he
had
been
permitted
him
to
keep.
those
are
the
merits,
now,
and
each
of
those
three
cases,
the
circuit
court
affirmed
on
the
merits
after
discussion
and
consideration
of
both.
now,
what
the
state
is
asking
in
this
case
is
really
very
simple.
it
is
asking
the
court
to
repudiate
a
long
line
of
well-established
principles
most
reasonably
reaffirmed
last
term
in
two
cases
in
wilwording
and
in
the
footnote
in
humphrey
and
cady
footnote
18,
to
the
effect
that
a
state
prisoner
can
challenged
the
conditions
of
confinement
under
1983.
we
are
not
urging
this
court
to
reclassify
every
case
of
1983.
we
do
not
deny
that
habeas
corpus
may
be
available,
this
court
set
so
last
term
and
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
every
habeas
corpus
case
shall
every
prisoner’s
rights
case,
every
1983
case
shall
be
carved
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
1983
and
construe
not
the
way
this
court,
not
the
way
untold
the
lower
court
have
construed
this
namely
as
1983
cases.
but
you
can
construe
them
as
habeas
corpus
cases
requiring
an
exhaustion
requirement.
and
we
say
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1871.
it
was
obviously
no
thought
at
that
time,
i
am
quite
sure
to
deal
with
prisoner’s
cases.
they
obviously
were
dealing
with
problems
of
friction
between
federal
and
state
courts
as
it
was
pointed
in
mitchum
and
foster
quite
clearly.
and
it
was
very
clear
that
they
gave
a
federal
form
and
what
was
then
and
almost
revolutionary
change
in
the
federal
jurisdiction.
a
federal
forth
of
federal
rights
and
without
having
to
go
all
the
way
through
the
state
system
and
in
1961,
in
monroe
and
pape
and
in
every
case
since
then
including
three
prisoner
cases
houghton
and
shafer,
wilwording
and
humphrey
and
cady
which
raised
the
related
problems
about
the
proper
place
of
confinement
for
someone
committed
under
the
--
was
wisconsin
sexually
deviant
act
and
every
one
of
these
case,
this
court
has
said
flatly
there
is
no
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
either
administrative
or
judicial
remedies.
mr.
herman
schwartz
no,
your
honor,
that’s
very
clearly
habeas
corpus
position
not
because
of
the
nature
of
the
classification,
but
because
of
the
policy
involved
in
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
policy
in
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
very
clear,
it’s
to
avoid
friction
between
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
which
it
has
entered
or
which
has
its
holding
somebody
in
custody
and
the
judgment
of
a
federal
court.
that
was
the
basis
to
correct
ex
parte
royal
and
that’s
what
involved
and
that’s
why
several
court
have
said
that
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
challenge
a
conviction
under
1983,
that
was
really
in
attempt
to
evade
and
we
would
say,
we
quite
agree.
an
attempt
to
evade
simply
should
not
be
permitted
because
then
it’s
time
to
evade
the
exhaustion
requirement.
but
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
and
this
is
the
essence
of
it.
we
are
dealing
with
administrative
action
which
of
course
in
a
variety
of
settings
with
the
variety
of
consequences
and
with
the
variety
of
remedies.
the
question
about
damages
was
absolutely
on
point
in
terms
of
what’s
at
stake
here
because
these
are
damage
actions
as
well
as
equitable
actions.
it
depends
on
whether
the
thing
is
monetary,
but
whatever
benefits
are
sought
to
be
gained
from
an
exhaustion
requirement
would
immediately
be
defeated
by
that
and
not
because
it’s
a
question
of
evading
it
but
because
according
to
the
state’s
own
argument
both
remedies
are
available,
always
both
forms
are
available
and
every
1983,
every
challenge
to
conditions
can
obviously
be
a
challenge
for
monetary
damages.
the
fact
is
that
the
state
in
its
brief
go
somewhat
far
did
they
went
in
oral
argument
because
what
they
said
is
if
there
is
a
damage
claim,
one
has
to
go
in
to
the
state
court
to
get
the
merits
decided
and
then
into
federal
court
to
get
damages.
now,
the
claim
is
like
this
is
habeas
corpus
because
it’s
custody.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
i
take
it
that’s
the
clear
implication.
i
can’t
see
any
reason
why
wouldn’t
be.
mr.
herman
schwartz
your
honor
on
page
40
in
their
brief
they
say,
on
the
contrary
if
an
inmate
obtains
relief
from
the
state
courts
by
demonstrating
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
but
there
is
no
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
if
the
exhaustion
philosophy
that
they
are
urging
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
if
that’s
the
case
then
the
entire
policy
of
what
they
are
urging
which
is
the
burden
on
the
courts,
friction,
all
of
the
rest
goes
out
the
window
and
there
is
no
point
to
it
at
all.
after
all
classifications
whether
or
not
one
is
going
to
carve
out
an
exception
and
again
i
would
say
your
honors
that
the
statute
gives
the
right
to
a
state
prisoner
under
1983.
they
are
going
to
carve
out
an
exception
and
the
exception
is
in
order
to
avoid
federal
state
friction,
in
order
to
somehow
avoid
the
burdens
on
these
courts.
mr.
herman
schwartz
that’s
quite
true
your
honor
and
it’s
at
that
point
that
the
fundamental
policy
involved
in
ex
parte
royal
comes
into
the
picture
such
a
policy
does
not
apply
here.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
administrative
action.
after
all
in
1948
when
judge
parker
try
to
get
the
habeas
corpus
statute
amended
a
more
--
the
problem
that
he
raised
was
that
of
a
federal
district
judge
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
what
the
state
is
urging
would
produce
precisely
that
because
it
would
require
that
there
be
a
state
recourse,
state
judicial
remedies
in
fact
they
go
further.
they
make
prisoners
do
a
double
job
contrary
to
what
this
court
said
in
wilwording
that
state
prisoners
are
not
held
to
a
higher
standard.
they
would
make
it
doubly
higher.
first,
the
administrative
jump
which
is
difficult
to
see
it
from
their
argument
as
to
habeas
corpus
and
then
the
judicial
job.
and
what
would
then
happen
is
that
a
federal
district
court
would
be
sitting
in
judgment
on
a
state
supreme
court’s
ruling
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
now
that,
will
--
if
anything
exacerbate
the
federal
state
relations
because
that’s
precisely
the
kind
of
problem
that
some
of
the
movements
for
amendment
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
produced
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
we
are
dealing
with
state
administrative
of
action
here
and
most
of
the
state
courts
have
frankly
said
that
because
many
of
the
state
courts
still
retain
the
hands
off
doctrine.
and
many
of
the
state
courts
still
say
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
executive
and
your
honors,
prisons
are
really
not
that
unique.
the
same
argument
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
they
--
it
depends
on
the
particular
state.
in
new
york
they
would
have
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
they
would
have
an
action
for
equitable
relief
under
section
79
(c).
yes
of
the
new
york
civil
rights
so
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
it’s
hard
for
me
to
answer
what
a
whole
group
of
courts
would
prefer
to
do
a
whole
group
of
individuals
-
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
would
take
it
then
they
would
not
prefer
to
be
bypassed.
i
would
take
the
attorney
general’s
representation
on
that,
but
of
course
the
whole
premise
of
the
civil
rights
act
as
clearly
laid
out
in
monroe
and
pape
and
mitchum
and
foster
is
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
federal
rights
assuror
has
the
right
to
a
federal
form
and
he
has
the
right
without
exhaustion
and
cases
are
legion
to
that
effect
just
last
year
on
the
administrative
issue
in
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
mr.
herman
schwartz
that’s
right
your
honor
and
that’s
include
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
no,
no,
on
the
good
time
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
your
honor
because
the
good
time
factor
is
clearly
fortuitous
because
to
make
the
issue
turn
or
whether
or
not
good
time
is
involved
makes
it
turn
on
whether
the
action
of
the
state
that’s
challenged
involves
the
sanction,
involving
the
rules
of
good
time
and
that
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
initially
it
was
available
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
that’s
right
but
essential
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
still
action
by
a
state
court.
that’s
the
problem
of
the
friction,
that’s
what
gave
rise
to
ex
parte
rom
--
ex
parte
royal
deals
with
the
prejudgment
situation.
it
deals
with
the
lawyer
who
is
confined
before
the
trial,
but
and
in
so
far
as
we
are
dealing
with
review
of
state
court
action
as
the
state
court
accrue
the
exhaustion
doctrine
applied.
but
if
we
are
dealing
with
good
time,
a
simple
hypothetical
will
illustrate
it.
suppose
the
state
has
a
rule
that
prohibits
black
and
white
prisoners
from
mingling
together
and
two
such
prisoners,
two
white
prisoners
or
black
prisoners
do.
one
man
is
deprived
of
good
time
and
the
other
man
will
say,
loses
a
good
job
and
those
things
happen
all
the
time.
the
first
man
challenging
exactly
the
same
conduct,
we’ll
have
to
exhaust
and
go
through
the
entire
state
system.
the
second
man
will
not
if
one
makes
to
turn
a
good
time
and
if
somebody
else
chooses
to
sue
damages
for
this
kind
of
thing,
again
the
very
same
state
interest,
the
very
same
state
action
simply
puts
a
different
remedy
he
will
then
have
to
go
in
and
sue
--
he
will
then
be
permitted
to
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
habeas
corpus
--
well,
this
court
has
said
that
habeas
corpus
lies
to
challenge
the
conditions
of
confinement
as
well.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
am
saying
that
this
court
said
precisely
that.
mr.
herman
schwartz
my
position
is
that
this
case
raises
the
question
of
whether
1983
is
available.
if
i
had
to
choose,
i
probably
would
say,
these
were
essentially
challenges
to
administrative
action,
official
state
action.
therefore,
1983
would
be
more
appropriate.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
if
i
well,
that’s
a
choice
if
you
are
forcing
me
say
that
it
be,
if
you
are
asking
me
to
say
the
choices
are
either
an
exclusive
1983
or
habeas
corpus
then
clearly
i
choose
an
exclusive
1983.
because
that’s
precisely
what
the
1871
statute
was
established
for.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
am
saying
that
that’s
what
this
court
has
said,
that’s
precisely
what
in
the
wilwording
--
part
two
of
the
wilwording
decision
opens
precisely
with
that
line.
part
two
says,
moreover
although
cognizable
in
federal
habeas
corpus
see
johnson
and
avery,
petitioners
pleading
may
also
be
read
to
plea
cause
of
action
in
the
civil
rights
act.
and
i
am
saying
that
this
court
has
given
them
that
right.
this
case
does
not
raise
that
issue
of
whether
he
has
a
habeas
corpus
right,
in
this
case,
what
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
absolutely.
mr.
herman
schwartz
absolutely,
not
only
that,
but
you
would
have
to
move
directly
backward
from
what
you
did
and
what
courts
have
done
in
wilwording
and
another
cases.
what
courts
have
done
frequently
is
to
say
that
we
will
construe
the
habeas
corpus
as
1983,
what
the
state
to
say
construe
1983
as
habeas
corpus.
now,
there
are
claims
that
the
federal
courts
were
being
overburdened
and
that
is
obviously
a
very
appealing
and
important
argument.
if
the
federal
court
is
overburdened
with
one
kind
of
case,
it
means
justice
is
denied
to
every
one.
but
the
problem
with
argument
is
first
of
all
the
1871
statute
or
any
statute
has
never
been
construed
to
allow
a
carve
out
because
of
that
problem.
secondly,
the
whole
question
of
burden
is
something
that
we
agree
we
don’t
know.
the
statistics
in
the
aba
brief
and
as
you
know
the
aba
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
the
respondent’s
position.
the
aba
points
out
that
some
like
3.4%
of
the
civil
cases
are
prisoner’s
civil
rights
act
cases.
the
statistic
show
that
takes
up
very
little
time,
well,
be
that
as
it
may
the
fact
is
that
these
complicated
questions
of
burdensomeness
of
appropriate
remedy
or
appropriately
for
congress.
these
involves
studies,
they
are
about
studies
of
what
is
a
proper
alternative
in
some
cases
as
the
aba
points
out
properly,
the
congress
has
decided
to
introduce
an
exhaustion
requirement
such
as
with,
you
would
say
utility
regulation.
in
other
cases,
there
maybe
many
other
devices
to
handle
these
problems,
but
certainly
as
we
discovered
in
the
mid
60’s
in
connection
with
habeas
corpus,
the
burden
was
not
what
it
seemed
and
over
time
it
even
doubt
and
flattened
out
and
that
would
be
true
here
as
well.
the
most
--
in
some
ways
the
most
interesting
aspect
of
the
state’s
argument
is
the
request
for
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
if
this
is
habeas
corpus,
where
does
that
come
from?
what
this
court
is
really
asking
what
the
stage
is
really
asking
this
court
to
do,
is
to
overrule
the
long
line
of
decisions
in
1983
cases
and
the
line
of
recent
prisoner
decisions
in
1983
where
the
exact
same
issues
were
raised.
the
exact
same
arguments
were
presented
and
dismissed
in
pre
curiam.
they
are
asking
this
court
to
repute.
in
houghton-shafer,
the
attorney
general
of
pennsylvania
said,
present
cases
are
unique
and
this
will
produce
multitude
in
this
litigation.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
unanimously
and
pre
curiam.
in
mcneese,
the
attorney
general
argued
that
education
is
unique
and
therefore
we
have
to
have
special
exhaustion
requirements
this
court
rejected.
now,
i
think
i
have
probably
said
enough
to
respond
to
most
of
the
points
that
seem
to
me
to
be
worth
mentioning
on
this.
i
would
say
only
with
respect
to
one
other
thing
and
that’s
this.
our
prisons
today
are
in
a
mess.
nobody
has
made
that
point
more
clear
than
the
chief
justice
and
the
president.
and
there
are
signs
of
change
and
those
signs
of
change
as
maurice
sigler,
chairman
of
the
federal
parole
board
said,
are
in
part
of
result
of
the
action
of
the
federal
courts
doing
what
the
1871
act
said
they
should
do.
and,
that
is
to
make
the
constitutional
apply
to
areas
where
the
states
are
not
fulfilling
constitutional
mandate.
for
this
court
now
to
repudiate
this
long
line
of
cases,
let’s
say
1983
is
not
available
is
to
say
to
the
prisoner
not
merely
that
you
are
second
class
citizen
which
all
society
says
anyway.
but
to
say
to
him
that
you
are
second
class
with
respect
to
access
to
federal
courts
and
with
respect
to
federal
rights.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
devastating
thing
to
say
at
this
time
in
our
history
when
they
are
beginning
of
signs
for
some
improvement
and
this
is
change.
i
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes
--
no,
not
to
a
judgment
because
who
else
is
there
who
challenges
judgments
except
prisoners
of
one
kind
or
another.
mr.
herman
schwartz
oh!
i
am
talking
about
the
whole
range
of
federal
rights
and
education
else
whereas
it
happens,
other
can
challenge
regulation
except
prisoners.
i
guess
their
families
can,
if
they
are
suing
for
the
damages
and
there
was
harm
to
them.
but
essentially
that
i
quite
agree
with
that
in
so
far
as
by
second
class
i
mean
as
opposed
to
other
litigants
seeking
to
affirm
federal
rights.
and
i
would
yield
the
balance
of
my
time
unless
the
court
has
questions
on
this
issue.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
i
see
no
reason
to
think
that
it
would
not
be.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
would
assume
that
it
is
res
judicata
as
just
as
it
is
with
any
other
litigant
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes
because
well,
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
the
issue
in
wilwording
on
that
particular
issue
was
that
there
were
some
question
as
--
i
am
sorry
are
you
talking
between
the
state
habeas
and
the
federal?
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
except
he
was
dismissed
on
jurisdictional
grounds
in
the
state
court.
missouri
said
that
there
was
no
remedy
that
was
available
or
this
isn’t
the
right
remedy
and
i
would
think
res
judicata
would
never
apply
on
that
context.
mr.
herman
schwartz
missouri
i
think,
in
that
case,
did
not
consider
the
issue
on
the
merits.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
think
if
they
had,
i
think
that
he
suffers
the
burden
of
any
other
litigant
which
is
that
if
he’s
had
one
day
in
court,
he’s
had
one
day
in
court
assuming
that
was
a
full
and
fair
hearing
and
that
there
were
no
infirmities.
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
that’s
a
matter
of
habeas
corpus
law
and
[voice
overlap]
mr.
herman
schwartz
if
it’s
an
available
statute
--
yes
it’s
available
remedy
yes
which
would
mean
of
course
that
his
attempt
to
get
his
federal
right
would
be
prolonged
in
further
in
a
situation
when
he
may
be
as
mr.
justice
marshall
says
not
eating.
mr.
herman
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
if
i
may
to
take
a
minute
or
two,
to
give
some
of
the
facts
underlying
these
cases.
because
although
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
the
jurisdictional
issue,
the
only
issue
on
which
cert
was
granted.
the
lower
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
en
banc
decision
affirmed
all
three
cases
on
the
merits.
and
the
merits
were
argued
in
several
bound.
but
the
first
two
cases,
kritsky
and
rodriguez
involved
very
serious
disciplinary
due
process
issues
in
which
men
were
denied
good
time
on
cases
which
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court
found
were
grossly
deficient
procedures.
mr.
katzoff
who
received
relief
very
quickly
by
the
way
was
punished
with
60
days
good
time
loss
and
60
days
in
a
solitary
confinement
for
writing
two
mildly
with
derogatory
comments,
“creep
and
cigar-smoking
s.
o.
b.”
in
diaries
which
he
did
not
circulate
and
which
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
found
every
institution
in
which
he
had
been
permitted
him
to
keep.
those
are
the
merits,
now,
and
each
of
those
three
cases,
the
circuit
court
affirmed
on
the
merits
after
discussion
and
consideration
of
both.
now,
what
the
state
is
asking
in
this
case
is
really
very
simple.
it
is
asking
the
court
to
repudiate
a
long
line
of
well-established
principles
most
reasonably
reaffirmed
last
term
in
two
cases
in
wilwording
and
in
the
footnote
in
humphrey
and
cady
footnote
18,
to
the
effect
that
a
state
prisoner
can
challenged
the
conditions
of
confinement
under
1983.
we
are
not
urging
this
court
to
reclassify
every
case
of
1983.
we
do
not
deny
that
habeas
corpus
may
be
available,
this
court
set
so
last
term
and
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
every
habeas
corpus
case
shall
every
prisoner’s
rights
case,
every
1983
case
shall
be
carved
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
1983
and
construe
not
the
way
this
court,
not
the
way
untold
the
lower
court
have
construed
this
namely
as
1983
cases.
but
you
can
construe
them
as
habeas
corpus
cases
requiring
an
exhaustion
requirement.
and
we
say
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1871.
it
was
obviously
no
thought
at
that
time,
i
am
quite
sure
to
deal
with
prisoner’s
cases.
they
obviously
were
dealing
with
problems
of
friction
between
federal
and
state
courts
as
it
was
pointed
in
mitchum
and
foster
quite
clearly.
and
it
was
very
clear
that
they
gave
a
federal
form
and
what
was
then
and
almost
revolutionary
change
in
the
federal
jurisdiction.
a
federal
forth
of
federal
rights
and
without
having
to
go
all
the
way
through
the
state
system
and
in
1961,
in
monroe
and
pape
and
in
every
case
since
then
including
three
prisoner
cases
houghton
and
shafer,
wilwording
and
humphrey
and
cady
which
raised
the
related
problems
about
the
proper
place
of
confinement
for
someone
committed
under
the
--
was
wisconsin
sexually
deviant
act
and
every
one
of
these
case,
this
court
has
said
flatly
there
is
no
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
either
administrative
or
judicial
remedies.
mr.
herman
schwartz
no,
your
honor,
that’s
very
clearly
habeas
corpus
position
not
because
of
the
nature
of
the
classification,
but
because
of
the
policy
involved
in
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
policy
in
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
very
clear,
it’s
to
avoid
friction
between
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
which
it
has
entered
or
which
has
its
holding
somebody
in
custody
and
the
judgment
of
a
federal
court.
that
was
the
basis
to
correct
ex
parte
royal
and
that’s
what
involved
and
that’s
why
several
court
have
said
that
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
challenge
a
conviction
under
1983,
that
was
really
in
attempt
to
evade
and
we
would
say,
we
quite
agree.
an
attempt
to
evade
simply
should
not
be
permitted
because
then
it’s
time
to
evade
the
exhaustion
requirement.
but
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
and
this
is
the
essence
of
it.
we
are
dealing
with
administrative
action
which
of
course
in
a
variety
of
settings
with
the
variety
of
consequences
and
with
the
variety
of
remedies.
the
question
about
damages
was
absolutely
on
point
in
terms
of
what’s
at
stake
here
because
these
are
damage
actions
as
well
as
equitable
actions.
it
depends
on
whether
the
thing
is
monetary,
but
whatever
benefits
are
sought
to
be
gained
from
an
exhaustion
requirement
would
immediately
be
defeated
by
that
and
not
because
it’s
a
question
of
evading
it
but
because
according
to
the
state’s
own
argument
both
remedies
are
available,
always
both
forms
are
available
and
every
1983,
every
challenge
to
conditions
can
obviously
be
a
challenge
for
monetary
damages.
the
fact
is
that
the
state
in
its
brief
go
somewhat
far
did
they
went
in
oral
argument
because
what
they
said
is
if
there
is
a
damage
claim,
one
has
to
go
in
to
the
state
court
to
get
the
merits
decided
and
then
into
federal
court
to
get
damages.
now,
the
claim
is
like
this
is
habeas
corpus
because
it’s
custody.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
i
take
it
that’s
the
clear
implication.
i
can’t
see
any
reason
why
wouldn’t
be.
mr.
herman
schwartz
your
honor
on
page
40
in
their
brief
they
say,
on
the
contrary
if
an
inmate
obtains
relief
from
the
state
courts
by
demonstrating
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
but
there
is
no
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
if
the
exhaustion
philosophy
that
they
are
urging
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
if
that’s
the
case
then
the
entire
policy
of
what
they
are
urging
which
is
the
burden
on
the
courts,
friction,
all
of
the
rest
goes
out
the
window
and
there
is
no
point
to
it
at
all.
after
all
classifications
whether
or
not
one
is
going
to
carve
out
an
exception
and
again
i
would
say
your
honors
that
the
statute
gives
the
right
to
a
state
prisoner
under
1983.
they
are
going
to
carve
out
an
exception
and
the
exception
is
in
order
to
avoid
federal
state
friction,
in
order
to
somehow
avoid
the
burdens
on
these
courts.
mr.
herman
schwartz
that’s
quite
true
your
honor
and
it’s
at
that
point
that
the
fundamental
policy
involved
in
ex
parte
royal
comes
into
the
picture
such
a
policy
does
not
apply
here.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
administrative
action.
after
all
in
1948
when
judge
parker
try
to
get
the
habeas
corpus
statute
amended
a
more
--
the
problem
that
he
raised
was
that
of
a
federal
district
judge
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
what
the
state
is
urging
would
produce
precisely
that
because
it
would
require
that
there
be
a
state
recourse,
state
judicial
remedies
in
fact
they
go
further.
they
make
prisoners
do
a
double
job
contrary
to
what
this
court
said
in
wilwording
that
state
prisoners
are
not
held
to
a
higher
standard.
they
would
make
it
doubly
higher.
first,
the
administrative
jump
which
is
difficult
to
see
it
from
their
argument
as
to
habeas
corpus
and
then
the
judicial
job.
and
what
would
then
happen
is
that
a
federal
district
court
would
be
sitting
in
judgment
on
a
state
supreme
court’s
ruling
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
now
that,
will
--
if
anything
exacerbate
the
federal
state
relations
because
that’s
precisely
the
kind
of
problem
that
some
of
the
movements
for
amendment
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
produced
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
we
are
dealing
with
state
administrative
of
action
here
and
most
of
the
state
courts
have
frankly
said
that
because
many
of
the
state
courts
still
retain
the
hands
off
doctrine.
and
many
of
the
state
courts
still
say
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
executive
and
your
honors,
prisons
are
really
not
that
unique.
the
same
argument
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
they
--
it
depends
on
the
particular
state.
in
new
york
they
would
have
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
they
would
have
an
action
for
equitable
relief
under
section
79
(c).
yes
of
the
new
york
civil
rights
so
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
it’s
hard
for
me
to
answer
what
a
whole
group
of
courts
would
prefer
to
do
a
whole
group
of
individuals
-
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
would
take
it
then
they
would
not
prefer
to
be
bypassed.
i
would
take
the
attorney
general’s
representation
on
that,
but
of
course
the
whole
premise
of
the
civil
rights
act
as
clearly
laid
out
in
monroe
and
pape
and
mitchum
and
foster
is
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
federal
rights
assuror
has
the
right
to
a
federal
form
and
he
has
the
right
without
exhaustion
and
cases
are
legion
to
that
effect
just
last
year
on
the
administrative
issue
in
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
mr.
herman
schwartz
that’s
right
your
honor
and
that’s
include
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
no,
no,
on
the
good
time
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
your
honor
because
the
good
time
factor
is
clearly
fortuitous
because
to
make
the
issue
turn
or
whether
or
not
good
time
is
involved
makes
it
turn
on
whether
the
action
of
the
state
that’s
challenged
involves
the
sanction,
involving
the
rules
of
good
time
and
that
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
initially
it
was
available
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
that’s
right
but
essential
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
still
action
by
a
state
court.
that’s
the
problem
of
the
friction,
that’s
what
gave
rise
to
ex
parte
rom
--
ex
parte
royal
deals
with
the
prejudgment
situation.
it
deals
with
the
lawyer
who
is
confined
before
the
trial,
but
and
in
so
far
as
we
are
dealing
with
review
of
state
court
action
as
the
state
court
accrue
the
exhaustion
doctrine
applied.
but
if
we
are
dealing
with
good
time,
a
simple
hypothetical
will
illustrate
it.
suppose
the
state
has
a
rule
that
prohibits
black
and
white
prisoners
from
mingling
together
and
two
such
prisoners,
two
white
prisoners
or
black
prisoners
do.
one
man
is
deprived
of
good
time
and
the
other
man
will
say,
loses
a
good
job
and
those
things
happen
all
the
time.
the
first
man
challenging
exactly
the
same
conduct,
we’ll
have
to
exhaust
and
go
through
the
entire
state
system.
the
second
man
will
not
if
one
makes
to
turn
a
good
time
and
if
somebody
else
chooses
to
sue
damages
for
this
kind
of
thing,
again
the
very
same
state
interest,
the
very
same
state
action
simply
puts
a
different
remedy
he
will
then
have
to
go
in
and
sue
--
he
will
then
be
permitted
to
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
habeas
corpus
--
well,
this
court
has
said
that
habeas
corpus
lies
to
challenge
the
conditions
of
confinement
as
well.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
am
saying
that
this
court
said
precisely
that.
mr.
herman
schwartz
my
position
is
that
this
case
raises
the
question
of
whether
1983
is
available.
if
i
had
to
choose,
i
probably
would
say,
these
were
essentially
challenges
to
administrative
action,
official
state
action.
therefore,
1983
would
be
more
appropriate.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
if
i
well,
that’s
a
choice
if
you
are
forcing
me
say
that
it
be,
if
you
are
asking
me
to
say
the
choices
are
either
an
exclusive
1983
or
habeas
corpus
then
clearly
i
choose
an
exclusive
1983.
because
that’s
precisely
what
the
1871
statute
was
established
for.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
am
saying
that
that’s
what
this
court
has
said,
that’s
precisely
what
in
the
wilwording
--
part
two
of
the
wilwording
decision
opens
precisely
with
that
line.
part
two
says,
moreover
although
cognizable
in
federal
habeas
corpus
see
johnson
and
avery,
petitioners
pleading
may
also
be
read
to
plea
cause
of
action
in
the
civil
rights
act.
and
i
am
saying
that
this
court
has
given
them
that
right.
this
case
does
not
raise
that
issue
of
whether
he
has
a
habeas
corpus
right,
in
this
case,
what
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
absolutely.
mr.
herman
schwartz
absolutely,
not
only
that,
but
you
would
have
to
move
directly
backward
from
what
you
did
and
what
courts
have
done
in
wilwording
and
another
cases.
what
courts
have
done
frequently
is
to
say
that
we
will
construe
the
habeas
corpus
as
1983,
what
the
state
to
say
construe
1983
as
habeas
corpus.
now,
there
are
claims
that
the
federal
courts
were
being
overburdened
and
that
is
obviously
a
very
appealing
and
important
argument.
if
the
federal
court
is
overburdened
with
one
kind
of
case,
it
means
justice
is
denied
to
every
one.
but
the
problem
with
argument
is
first
of
all
the
1871
statute
or
any
statute
has
never
been
construed
to
allow
a
carve
out
because
of
that
problem.
secondly,
the
whole
question
of
burden
is
something
that
we
agree
we
don’t
know.
the
statistics
in
the
aba
brief
and
as
you
know
the
aba
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
the
respondent’s
position.
the
aba
points
out
that
some
like
3.4%
of
the
civil
cases
are
prisoner’s
civil
rights
act
cases.
the
statistic
show
that
takes
up
very
little
time,
well,
be
that
as
it
may
the
fact
is
that
these
complicated
questions
of
burdensomeness
of
appropriate
remedy
or
appropriately
for
congress.
these
involves
studies,
they
are
about
studies
of
what
is
a
proper
alternative
in
some
cases
as
the
aba
points
out
properly,
the
congress
has
decided
to
introduce
an
exhaustion
requirement
such
as
with,
you
would
say
utility
regulation.
in
other
cases,
there
maybe
many
other
devices
to
handle
these
problems,
but
certainly
as
we
discovered
in
the
mid
60’s
in
connection
with
habeas
corpus,
the
burden
was
not
what
it
seemed
and
over
time
it
even
doubt
and
flattened
out
and
that
would
be
true
here
as
well.
the
most
--
in
some
ways
the
most
interesting
aspect
of
the
state’s
argument
is
the
request
for
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
if
this
is
habeas
corpus,
where
does
that
come
from?
what
this
court
is
really
asking
what
the
stage
is
really
asking
this
court
to
do,
is
to
overrule
the
long
line
of
decisions
in
1983
cases
and
the
line
of
recent
prisoner
decisions
in
1983
where
the
exact
same
issues
were
raised.
the
exact
same
arguments
were
presented
and
dismissed
in
pre
curiam.
they
are
asking
this
court
to
repute.
in
houghton-shafer,
the
attorney
general
of
pennsylvania
said,
present
cases
are
unique
and
this
will
produce
multitude
in
this
litigation.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
unanimously
and
pre
curiam.
in
mcneese,
the
attorney
general
argued
that
education
is
unique
and
therefore
we
have
to
have
special
exhaustion
requirements
this
court
rejected.
now,
i
think
i
have
probably
said
enough
to
respond
to
most
of
the
points
that
seem
to
me
to
be
worth
mentioning
on
this.
i
would
say
only
with
respect
to
one
other
thing
and
that’s
this.
our
prisons
today
are
in
a
mess.
nobody
has
made
that
point
more
clear
than
the
chief
justice
and
the
president.
and
there
are
signs
of
change
and
those
signs
of
change
as
maurice
sigler,
chairman
of
the
federal
parole
board
said,
are
in
part
of
result
of
the
action
of
the
federal
courts
doing
what
the
1871
act
said
they
should
do.
and,
that
is
to
make
the
constitutional
apply
to
areas
where
the
states
are
not
fulfilling
constitutional
mandate.
for
this
court
now
to
repudiate
this
long
line
of
cases,
let’s
say
1983
is
not
available
is
to
say
to
the
prisoner
not
merely
that
you
are
second
class
citizen
which
all
society
says
anyway.
but
to
say
to
him
that
you
are
second
class
with
respect
to
access
to
federal
courts
and
with
respect
to
federal
rights.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
devastating
thing
to
say
at
this
time
in
our
history
when
they
are
beginning
of
signs
for
some
improvement
and
this
is
change.
i
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes
--
no,
not
to
a
judgment
because
who
else
is
there
who
challenges
judgments
except
prisoners
of
one
kind
or
another.
mr.
herman
schwartz
oh!
i
am
talking
about
the
whole
range
of
federal
rights
and
education
else
whereas
it
happens,
other
can
challenge
regulation
except
prisoners.
i
guess
their
families
can,
if
they
are
suing
for
the
damages
and
there
was
harm
to
them.
but
essentially
that
i
quite
agree
with
that
in
so
far
as
by
second
class
i
mean
as
opposed
to
other
litigants
seeking
to
affirm
federal
rights.
and
i
would
yield
the
balance
of
my
time
unless
the
court
has
questions
on
this
issue.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
i
see
no
reason
to
think
that
it
would
not
be.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
would
assume
that
it
is
res
judicata
as
just
as
it
is
with
any
other
litigant
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes
because
well,
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
the
issue
in
wilwording
on
that
particular
issue
was
that
there
were
some
question
as
--
i
am
sorry
are
you
talking
between
the
state
habeas
and
the
federal?
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
except
he
was
dismissed
on
jurisdictional
grounds
in
the
state
court.
missouri
said
that
there
was
no
remedy
that
was
available
or
this
isn’t
the
right
remedy
and
i
would
think
res
judicata
would
never
apply
on
that
context.
mr.
herman
schwartz
missouri
i
think,
in
that
case,
did
not
consider
the
issue
on
the
merits.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
think
if
they
had,
i
think
that
he
suffers
the
burden
of
any
other
litigant
which
is
that
if
he’s
had
one
day
in
court,
he’s
had
one
day
in
court
assuming
that
was
a
full
and
fair
hearing
and
that
there
were
no
infirmities.
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
that’s
a
matter
of
habeas
corpus
law
and
[voice
overlap]
mr.
herman
schwartz
if
it’s
an
available
statute
--
yes
it’s
available
remedy
yes
which
would
mean
of
course
that
his
attempt
to
get
his
federal
right
would
be
prolonged
in
further
in
a
situation
when
he
may
be
as
mr.
justice
marshall
says
not
eating.
