justice

rehnquist
mrs.
cohen,
is
this
a
question
that
should
be
decided
by
this
court
just
on
the
basis
of
competing
policy
considerations
or
it
is
basically
statutory
inquiry
as
to
what
congress
has
provide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
with
a
state
prisoner
isn’t
attacking
the
judgment
under
which
he
is
concluded?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schwartz,
do
you
think
in
the
1983
action
would
lie
to
challenge
a
judgment
under
which
a
man
was
being
held
to
state
court
judgment
depends
on
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don’t
understand
that
that’s
the
state’s
contention
that
in
short
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
is
necessary
before
of
1983
[voice

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
the
statute
gives
the
right
to
the
prisoner
under
1983,
if
you
read
1983
literally
without
regard
to
the
habeas
corpus
provision,
you
could
use
it
to
challenge
the
state
judgment
of
conviction,
couldn’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
[voice
overlap]
historically
it
would
reach
something
only
before
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
neither
1983
nor
the
habeas
corpus
statute
were
on
the
book,
could
these
prisoners
go
into
the
united
states
district
court
and
obtain
the
relief
they
sought?
