justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
if
he
is
complaining
about
problems
in
the
prison,
he
had
to
go
for
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
if
he
served
life
imprisonment
and
he
has
complained
about
the
fact
that
they
hit
him
over
the
head
with
a
club,
his
relief
is
to
be
released?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
if
the
prison
has
the
standard
rule
and
all
the
prisons
of
new
york
that
redhead
people
shall
not
eat,
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
think
the
civil
rights
act
will
reach
that
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
1983
is
limited
to
damages.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
also
equitable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
wouldn’t
have
a
right
to
get
an
injunction
to
say,
follow
the
constitution
and
stop
violating
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
providing
the
food?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
soon
as
he
filed
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
soon
as
he
filed
this
habeas
corpus,
he
would
get
his
food?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
i
am
not
and
restate
here.
is
there
any
action
in
habeas
corpus
that
similar
to
tro?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there’s
nothing
like
a
preliminary
habeas
corpus,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
you
want
some
immediate
relief,
how
can
you
get
it
in
habeas
corpus
as
swiftly
as
you
can
by
temporary
restraining
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
decided
that
they
don’t
have
to
do
it
in
1983.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
your
reason
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
the
state
prisoner
whatever
happens
to
him
is
so
relief
in
the
federal
court
by
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
it
more
--
how
does
it
quicker
than
a
preliminary
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
preliminary
injunction
in
three
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
take
my
case
here,
the
finest
criminal
lawyer
in
the
world?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
eat?
and
he’s
got
to
eat?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
meantime,
he
is
eating?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
goes
the
other
way,
he
won’t
be
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
until
the
habeas
corpus
is
decided.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
time
do
you
have
to
reply
to
the
habeas
corpus
petitions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
20
days
of
not
eating?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
know
it
says
it
takes
precedence
and
i
also
notice
that
the
dockets
in
our
precedence
in
some
court
means
that
you
get
one
year
instead
four.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
think
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
you
could
get
a
preliminary
injunction
sooner
than
you
could
get
a
final
decision
in
any
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
i
take
a
tro
while
you
have
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
can
be
given
in
three
seconds.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
can’t
put
my
thinking
on
what
happens
in
upstate
new
york
or
upstate
(inaudible)
talking
about
the
general
difference
between
habeas
corpus
and
temporary
restraint
orders
and
preliminary
injunctions.
and
i
know
you
can
get
a
tro
without
any
notice
in
not
in
(inaudible).
and
i’ve
never
heard
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus
being
issued
without
giving
the
other
side
an
opportunity
to
open
its
mouth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
has
soon
do
they
decide?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
are
so
far
out
of
the
record
in
this
case,
i
don’t
mind
going
that
one
step
further.
