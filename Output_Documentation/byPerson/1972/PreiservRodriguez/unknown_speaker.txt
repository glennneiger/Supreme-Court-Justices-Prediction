unknown
speaker
also,
but
also
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
if
you
had
the
choice
to
make
and
you
want
to
--
you
would
like
to
retain
your
--
what
other
possibility
there
is
to
get
damages?
unknown
speaker
under
what?
unknown
speaker
now,
but
you
would
you
say
that
there
had
to
be
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
first
or
not
on
the
damage
question?
unknown
speaker
so,
this
is
really
--
so
this
isn’t
--
the
state’s
position
is
that
this
is
really
in
some
respect
to
both
its
proper
under
both
procedures?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
--
do
i
misunderstand
you
when
i
understand
this
that
your
claim
is
that
first
of
all
it’s
limited
to
cases
involving
prisoners
in
state
custody.
and
secondly,
that
when
the
complaint
is
either
of
the
custody
of
itself
or
of
the
conditions
of
the
custody
and
when
the
--
and
in
so
far
as
the
relief
is
either
release
or
correction
of
the
conditions
of
those
custodies,
then
habeas
corpus
is
and
must
should
be
an
exclusive
remedy?
unknown
speaker
and
that
questions
of
damages
are
--
can
properly
be
left
to
the
civil
action
[voice
overlap].
unknown
speaker
and
if
they’re
not
appropriate
in
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
not
kind
of
a
relief
that
the
habeas
corpus
petition
can
deal.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
see
then
mrs.
cohen,
i
gather
am
i
right
in
my
history
the
extension
of
habeas
corpus
to
state
prisoners
came
in
about
1867,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
the
predecessor
of
the
1983
which
was
what,
old
section
1
of
the
old
ku
klux
klan
likely?
unknown
speaker
was
that
about
1870-1871.
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
either
to
indicate
that
congress
--
that’s
we’re
dealing
with
two
federal
statutes,
that
congress
meant
that
the
prisoner
should
have
to
take
one
and
couldn’t
go
the
other
--
unknown
speaker
well,
and
then
what
basis
do
you
suggest
that
we
should
say
in
the
state
prisoner
that
congress
said,
that
you
have
to
go
to
a
federal
habeas
in
a
situation,
now,
that
you
can’t
and
quote
the
remedy
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
well
then
in
what
places
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
say
to
the
state
prisoner?
unknown
speaker
we
have
congress’
variety
with
two
remedies
but
you
must
take
the
federal
habeas,
you
may
not
invoke
the
1983?
unknown
speaker
but
typically,
if
your
petition
is
that
before
coming
to
the
habeas
corpus
court,
they
must
go
to
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
be
a
habeas
corpus
in
there,
it
would
or
already
taken
to
kind
it
would
be
a
specific
equitable
action
provided
for
by
the
state
law?
unknown
speaker
except
that
he
could
--
he’d
have
to
first
to
exhaust
that’s
what
you
told
us
in
the
state
of
administrative
remedies?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
of
the
1983
suit?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
--
let’s
assume
it
were
a
1983
suit
against
state,
you
don’t
have
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it,
even
if
that
was
so
if
the
state
court
determination
were
adverse
to
the
claim
and
than
to
be
res
judicata,
the
1983
wouldn’t?
unknown
speaker
but
you
also
i
gather,
don’t
you
imply
that
a
view
that
if
maybe
that
both
remedies
are
available
and
it
up
to
the
prisoner
to
choose
which?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
to
agree
with
the
state
here,
are
you
suggesting
we
have
to
overrule
wilwording?
unknown
speaker
or
just
a
valid
at
least
to
that
sentence?
unknown
speaker
even
if
his
action
in
the
state
court
is
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
we
ever
get
to
that
contrary
position
in
part
to
wilwording?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
position
that
if
you
brought
a
state
habeas
corpus
action
first?
unknown
speaker
and
then
when
turned
down
then
you
purport
to
bring
a
1983
action
the
federal
courts
res
judicata?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
had?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
were
purporting
to
bring
a
federal
habeas
corpus
action
says
that
should
be
available
as
a
matter
of
choice?
then
he
must
if
he
chose
the
wrong
remedy
in
the
first
place
in
the
state
court,
he
should
be
sent
back
to
get
the
right
whenever
it’s
available?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
with
you
but
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
constitutional
question
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
a
matter,
which
one
of
the
statues
is
applicable
or
both?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the
underlying
claims
are
constitutional
claims
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
cohen,
couldn’t
congress
tomorrow
amend
1983
to
support
your
position
--
unknown
speaker
--
or
amend
of
the
habeas
corpus
act?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i
know
but
congress
could
change
this
whole
picture.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
see
how
it’s
a
constitutional
question.
unknown
speaker
supposedly,
they
--
our
past
decisions
have
proceeded
on
the
basis
of
that
we
were
even
then
interpreting
the
statutes
and
purporting
to
apply
the
congressional
will
on
their
own.
unknown
speaker
also,
but
also
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
if
you
had
the
choice
to
make
and
you
want
to
--
you
would
like
to
retain
your
--
what
other
