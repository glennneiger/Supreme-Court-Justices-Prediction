justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don’t
deny
that
these
prisoners
wouldn’t
have
remedy
in
the
state
court
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
talk
about
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
that
what
they
argue
is
of
the
new
york
laws
to
[voice

--
and
court,
do
you
think
the
new
york
courts
refer
to
be
bypassed
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
representative
of
the
state
would
merely
say
the
state
would
prefer
to
be
bypassed?
justice
byron
r.
white
still
can
–
we
still
believe
that
the
1983
statute
must
be
accommodated
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
and
when
you
do
get
into
the
area
of
counting
a
judgment
at
least
then
you
[voice

justice
byron

white
at
least
then
you
make
the
1983
although
literally
on
its
face
reads
on
this
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
nevertheless
does
not
cover?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
could
also
say,
i
suppose
that
if
you
are
not
challenging
a
judgment
but
you
are
claiming
release
from
custody
for
failure
to
give
good
time
or
what,
would
you
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
it’s
a
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
historically,
federal
agent
purpose
would
reach
something
even
before
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
am
i
understanding
now
that
you
are
arguing
a
habeas
corpus
would
not
be
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
there
is
a
choice
between
habeas
corpus
and
[voice

is
that

justice
byron

white
what’s
your
position?
justice
byron

exclusive?
justice
byron

white
now,
today
if
you
--
the
1983
approach
would
be
subject
to
the
normal
rules
of
res
judicata,
i
take
it?
justice
byron

white
well,
assume
--
assume
we
agree
with
you
but
a
prisoner
resorts
to
the
