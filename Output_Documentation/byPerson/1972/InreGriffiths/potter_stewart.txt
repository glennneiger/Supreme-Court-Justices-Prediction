justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
indicate
that
why
she
doesn’t
want
to
--
why
she
does
not
intend
to
become
citizen
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
she
intends
to
remain
in
the
united
states
and
particularly
in
connecticut?
justice
potter
stewart
indefinitely?
justice
potter
stewart
and
clearly
intends
not
to
become
a
citizen?
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
have
a
personal
feeling
or
one
never
knows
about
the
future,
about
the
relationships
for
example
between
our
country
and
holland,
or
any
other
nation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
long
as
that
personal
feeling
of
loyalty
exists
to
the
nation
of
which
you’re
now
a
citizen,
that’s
i
suppose
what
connecticut
was
trying
to
get
at,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
international
affairs
under
our
constitution
and
all
those
matters,
you’ll
turn
over
to
the
national
government.
states
don’t
have
foreign
policies
with
other
nations.
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
our
constitution
was
adopted.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that’s
not
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
residence
doesn’t
mean
domicile
then?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
also
domicile
involves
an
intent
to
remain
there
indefinitely.
when
i
stay
on
overnight
in
a
hotel
in
new
haven,
that
doesn’t
make
me
a
resident
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
i
have
the
intention
residing
in
connecticut
indefinitely
then
i
am
and
then
domicile
depends
upon
intent?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
intent?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
apparently,
no.
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
under
your
submission
in
this
case,
somebody
could
come
from
japan,
or
uganda,
or
nepal,
and
just
fill
out
the
questionnaire
and
take
the
connecticut
bar
exam.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
do
so.
is
that
right
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
alright,
is
there
long
enough
for
an
interview.
justice
potter
stewart
alright
he
is
found
he
law
school
in
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
if
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
constitutionally
requires,
it’s
what
you’re
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
no,
you’re
saying
what
the
(voice
overlap)
constitution
requires
is
that
connecticut
must,
if
a
person
is
otherwise
qualified,
must
let
him
take
the
bar
exam
whether
or
not
he’s
a
citizen.
so
as
i
say,
you
could
from
india
or
ceylon,
or
nepal,
or
uganda,
or
tanzania,
and
be
there
long
enough
for
an
examination
and
to
show
you’ve
gone
to
law
school
and
that
connecticut
as
constitutionally
required,
let
him
take
the
bar
exam
and
if
you
passes
it,
do
admit
him
to
the
bar
of
connecticut,
then
he
can
leave
the
next
night
and
never
come
back.
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
connecticut
can
constitutionally
require
that
a
person
be
a
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you’ve
told
this
that
it
doesn’t
require
that
he
be
domicile
in
connecticut.
therefore
it
since
it
doesn’t,
then
your
constitutional
claim
does
come
down
and
does
it
not
to
what
i
suggested
in
my
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
it
could
but
it
hasn’t
you
told
us.
justice
potter
stewart
he
comes
from
timbuktu
so
long
as
he
was
there
long
enough
for
an
interview,
and
filled
out
question
8
(2)
that
he
was
a
resident
in
connecticut
and
intended
to
stay
there
then
connecticut
couldn’t
require
that
he’d
be
a
citizen?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
your
claim
was
that
connecticut
could
not
constitutionally
require
that
a
person
be
a
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that’s
not
the
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
in
your
case,
is
whether
or
not
the
constitution
compels
connecticut
to
allow
somebody
to
take
its
bar
exam
even
though
that
person
is
not
a
citizen.
isn’t
that
what
this
case
is
about?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
little
strange
to
be
saying
that
a
classification
that
is
made
in
the
constitution
itself
in
many
different
provisions
of
the
constitution
itself,
i.e.
between
citizens
and
other
persons
who
are
not
citizens
within
the
united
states,
that
classification
is
constitutionally
suspect.
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
makes
that,
makes
those
classifications.
the
fifteen
amendment
is
the
right
of
to
franchise
to
citizens,
not
to
persons.
the
fourteenth
amendment
gives
some
protections
to
citizens
that
it
doesn’t
give
to
persons.
it
gives
some
to
all
persons
and
there
are
other
places
all
through
the
constitution
where
you
find
that
distinction.
and
isn’t
it
a
little
odd,
you
suppose
to
be
saying
that
that’s
constitutionally
suspect
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
thirteenth
amendment,
protects
all
(inaudible)
you
were
saying.
the
protection
of
fifteenth
amendment
stand
--
justice
potter
stewart
precisely
this
distinction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
what
is
my
point.
many
other
distinctions
of
course
as
well
but
precisely
the
one
that
you’re
not
telling
us
is
suspect
under
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
is
the
form
of
oath
in
here
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.

justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
what’s
alienage
have
to
do
with
character?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
has.
it’s
irrelevant
to
a
person’s
character.
i
mean
a
person
could
have
been
a
patriotic
german
in
world
war
ii
and
finest
character
but
we
were
at
war
with
that
country
and
probably
would
not
have
admitted
somebody
like
that
to
our
bar
in
between
1941
and
1945,
but
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
person’s
character.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
irrelevant
to
character
now
the
question
is
--
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
truax
was
not
a
--
wasn’t
an
equal
protection
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
so
far
as
connecticut
requires,
there’s
no
requirement
that
he’d
be
a
citizen
of
connecticut
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
simply
a
requirement
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
has
to
do
with
residence
that
is
not
before
us
here?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
indicate
that
why
she
doesn’t
want
to
--
why
she
does
not
intend
to
become
citizen
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
does
the

show
whether
or
not
she
intends
to
remain
in
the

and
particularly
in
connecticut?
justice
potter
stewart
indefinitely?
justice
potter
stewart
and
clearly
intends
not
to
become
a
citizen?
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
have
a
personal
feeling
or
one

the

so
that’s
not
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
residence
doesn’t
mean
domicile
then?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
also
domicile
involves
an
intent
to
remain
there
indefinitely.
when
i
stay

justice

but
if
i

i

then

depends
upon

justice

(voice

intent?
justice

no.
apparently,
no.
justice

so

is

justice

constitutionally

it’s
what
you’re

justice

no.
no,
you’re

what
the

is
that

if
a

must
let

so

be

then
he
can

never

justice

the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
connecticut
can
constitutionally
require
that
a
person
be
a
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you’ve
told
this
that
it
doesn’t
require
that
he
be
domicile
in
connecticut.
therefore
it
since
it
doesn’t,
then
your
constitutional
claim
does
come
down
and
does
it
not
to
what
i
suggested
in
my
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
it
could
but
it
hasn’t
you
told

justice

he

i

your

that
connecticut

justice
potter
stewart
but
that’s

the
issue.
justice

the
issue
in
your

is
whether
or
