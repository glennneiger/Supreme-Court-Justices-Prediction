mr.

following
through
with
your
hypothetical
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
do
you
know
whether
you
could
be
admitted
to
the
bar
of
holland?
justice
harry

this
is
outside
the
record.
is
your
client’s
still
a
resident
in
connecticut?
justice
harry
a.

well,
is
the
case
moot?
justice

blackmun
mr.
broiles,
if
the
graham
case
were
not
on
the
books,
would
you
be
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
in
your
opinion,
you
don’t
have
to
rely
on
graham?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
that
connection,
mr.
tiernan,
you
have
admission
by
a
motion
in
connecticut
as
i
understood
from
your
prior
remark?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
suppose,
well
there
are
states
today
which
permit
a
person
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar
without
proof
of
citizenship.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
someone
presented
himself
to
the
connecticut
bar
authorities
with
proof
of
admission
in
one
of
those
states,
would
connecticut
admit
him
by
motion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
here,
he
could
be
admitted
if
he
had
three
years
behind
him?
justice
harry

three
years

justice
harry
a.

in
those
treaties?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
while
i
have
interrupted
you
mr.
tiernan,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
which
really
isn’t
here
on
case
but
it
still
bothers
me?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
connecticut
in
addition
to
requiring
citizenship
for
attorneys
and
physicians
also
requires
it
for
funeral
directors,
and
embalmers,
and
hairdressers,
and
barbers,
and
sanitarian?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
a
fact
that
this

does
this?
