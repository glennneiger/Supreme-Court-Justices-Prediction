mr.
r.
david
broiles
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
fre
le
poole
griffiths
was
born
in
the
netherlands
in
1940.
immigrated
to
this
country
on
a
temporary
visa
in
1965.
obtained
the
status
of
a
permanent
resident
alien
after
she
acquired
work
in
this
country
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
1965.
she
continued
to
work
in
this
country
and
was
married
in
1967,
and
moved
to
washington,
d.c.
after
residing
in
washington,
d.c.
approximately
two
years,
she
moved
to
new
haven,
connecticut
where
she
was
admitted
to
yale
law
school
as
a
second
year
law
student.
she
completed
her
studies
for
an
llb
degree
at
yale
law
school
and
graduated
from
yale
law
school
in
june
of
1969.
she
has
the
equivalent
of
a
ba
in
law
from
the
university
of
leiden
in
the
netherlands,
and
llb
in
law
from
the
university
of
amsterdam
in
the
netherlands,
and
an
llb
in
law
from
yale
university
in
new
haven,
connecticut.
she
is
concededly,
in
all
respects,
qualified
for
admission
to
the
bar
examination
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
but
for
the
fact
that
rule
8
(1)
of
the
superior
court
rules
of
the
state
of
connecticut
requires
that
all
applicants
for
admission
to
the
bar
examination,
be
citizens
of
the
united
states.
fre
griffiths
is
not
a
citizen
of
united
states
and
did
not
at
the
time
for
application
intend
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
she
was
at
the
time
of
her
application,
a
resident
within
the
residency
requirements
of
the
state
of
connecticut
for
admission
to
the
bar.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
this
was
the
fourth
hearing
that
we’ve
attended
and
you’re
the
first
person
to
ask.
the
record
does
not
so
indicate
why
she
does
not
intend
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
if
you
like
for
me
to
give
you
the
reason,
i
would
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
the
record
does
not
show
whether
she
intends
to
remain
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
she
was
not
asked
that
question.
she
in
fact,
does
intend
to
reside
in
the
united
states
as
with
her
husband.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
and
she
does
intend
to
reside
in
the
united
states
indefinitely.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
she
does
not
at
this
time
intend
to
become
a
citizen.
her
feeling
is
that
after
25
years
of
living
in
holland
that
she
cannot
give
that
up
at
this
particular
time.
dual
citizenship
is
not
a
possibility.
it
would
be
as
if
we
immigrated
to
holland,
say
we
married
a
dutch
citizen
and
i
was
living
in
holland
and
my
wife
was
working
there,
and
in
order
to
practice
my
profession
as
a
lawyer,
i
was
required
to
give
up
my
citizenship
in
the
united
states.
my
failure
to
do
that
and
i
would
not
give
up
my
citizenship
in
the
united
states
to
be
a
dutch
citizen
would
not
be
because
of
any
lack
of
loyalty
to
holland,
where
i’m
resident
thereof
or
because
i
intended
to
violate
any
laws
of
holland
or
because
i
could
not
abide
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
holland.
it
will
be
because
of
the
feeling
that
i
have
after
having
my
family
and
resided
in
the
united
states
for
25
years.
that
sort
of
personal
feeling
is
what
mrs.
griffiths
has
and
she
doesn’t
feel
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no
there
are
contingencies
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
it
is
not
what
connecticut
is
trying
to
get
at.
connecticut
--
people
have
personal
feelings,
for
example,
with
regards
to
their
citizenship
in
the
state
in
the
united
states,
by
the
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
have
a
dual
citizenship
to
a
state
and
to
the
united
states
if
we
are
a
citizens
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
well,
to
contingency
--
if
you’re
asking,
is
there
a
contingency
that
she
might
go
back
to
holland.
that
contingency,
in
fact,
exists
as
much
as
the
contingency
that
someone
born
in
california,
who
is
admitted
to
practice
law
in
connecticut,
might
go
back
to
california,
that
someone
who’s
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
might
choose
to
re-announce
their
united
states
citizenship
and
move
to
israel.
that
someone
might
die,
that
someone
might
commit
a
breach
to
the
canons
of
ethics
as
a
member
of
the
bar
and
be
disqualified.
there
are
all
sorts
of
disabling
contingencies
that
one
can
have
and
certainly
one
of
them
would
be
that
she
can
go
to
holland.
that’s
a
contingency
that
her
husband
also
is
subject
to,
that
anyone
would
be
subject
to
in
leaving
united
states.
i
do
not
think
it
is
what
the
state
of
connecticut
is
getting
at
by
requiring
united
states
citizenship
of
all
members
or
applicants
to
the
bar
though.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
i
would
not
have
a
right
to
be
a
judge
in
holland
though
it
is
interesting
that
my
client,
who
is
not
a
citizen
to
united
states,
and
is
a
citizen
of
holland,
would
on
our
research,
have
a
right
to
be
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
our
research
tells
me
that
in
holland
that
is
not
the
case.
i’m
telling
you
what
my
client
tells
me
about
dutch
law.
i
don’t
purport
to
know
anything
about
it
other
than
that.
we
have
not
found
any
disabling
provisions
for
an
alien
to
be
a
united
states
district
court
judge
or
to
be
on
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
there’s
no
requirement
that
a
justice
on
the
supreme
court
be
a
lawyer.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
according
to
my
client,
i
could
not.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
without
being
a
dutch
citizen.
our
research
shows
that
there
are
very
few
countries
that
allow
what
one
would
call
reciprocity
without
the
requirement
of
citizenship.
one
of
the
few
being
japan,
and
it
is
apparently
possible
in
england,
but
it
is
not
possible
according
to
her
in
holland.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
she
is
presently
living
in
holland
and
is
coming
back
thursday
and
has
the
intention
of
practicing
in
connecticut
if
this
opinion
is
favorable
to
her.
she
went
to
holland
and
have
a
child.
she
now
has,
since
the
beginning
of
this
lawsuit
has
had
two
children.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no
it
is
not
your
honor.
there
is
no
residency
requirement
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
rule
8
(2)
requires
that
you
have
an
intention
to
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut
which
she
has.
at
the
time
the
case
was
brought
up
to
court,
she’d
been
a
resident
of
connecticut
for
two
years.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
it
means,
an
intent
to
reside
in
connecticut
so
long
as
it
takes
to
become
a
member
of
the
bar.
once
one
has
become
a
member
of
the
bar,
you
need
no
longer
to
have
to
that
intent.
for
example
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
residency
means
living
there.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
just
being
there.
i,
for
example,
i’m
a
member
of
the
connecticut
bar,
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
connecticut
as
i
stand
here
right
now.
i
have
not
resided
in
the
state
of
connecticut
for
two
years.
i
have
been
to
connecticut
only
twice
in
those
two
years,
both
times
in
connection
with
this
lawsuit.
i
became
a
member
of
the
bar
at
the
state
of
connecticut
after
my
graduation
from
a
law
school
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
no
questions
were
asked
to
me
and
no
questions
are
required
by
the
rules
in
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
connecticut
that
i
intend
to
permanently
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
rule
8
(2)
says,
“you
must
either
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut
or
intend
to
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut.”
it
does
not
require
an
intention
to
permanently
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
i
recently
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
residence
in
fact
does
mean
just
that.
that
you
are
at
the
time
you
make
application
for
the
admission
to
the
bar,
have
the
intention
to
reside.
i
take
it
domicile
to
mean
actually
physically
be
present.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
would
not.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
domicile
intents
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes,
i
don’t
think
the
intent
can
reasonably
said
to
be
indefinitely.
the
intent
must
be
to
stay
there
having
no
particular
plans
to
leave
at
this
time
to
go
some
place
else.
this
is
where
i
am
now.
i’m
not
definitely
living
some
place
else.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no
i
don’t
think
so.
i
don’t
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
based
on
the
rules
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
that
is
quite
right.
that’s
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no
that’s
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
that’s
absolutely
not
the
position
here.
one
has
to
take
--
one
has
not
only
fill
out
the
questionnaire
but
be
interviewed
by
the
bar
committee.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
and
the
bar
committee
is
satisfied
to
these
qualifications.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
as
to
his
residency
in
the
state
of
connecticut
then
it
seems
clear
under
the
rule
of
the
state
of
connecticut
that
he’s
admissible.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i’m
saying
that
that’s
what
the
rule
of
the
state
of
connecticut
requires.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
is
not
my
position.
the
constitution
does
not
require
that.
the
original
question
asked
by
you
was
with
regard
there
was
not
the
purpose
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
residency,
if
the
people
were
residents
of
the
state
in
which
they
were
lawyers.
in
fact,
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
require
more
than
what
you
have
described.
if
the
state
of
connecticut
were
to
just
require
a
six-month
residency
requirement
that
may
work
well
withstand
the
test
of
constitutionality.
the
new
mexico
case
which
you
recently
denied
cert
on
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
does
not.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
connecticut
could
require
constitutionally.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
has
not.
if
this
case,
does
come
down
to
my
client
on
the
connecticut
rule
qualify
because
she
wasn’t
back
in
the
connecticut
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
bar
examiners,
a
resident
under
that
rule.
that
has
been
so
found
and
it
is
not
disputed.
that
connecticut
has
no
further
requirements
other
than
domicile
or
intention
to
be
a
resident.
in
this
case
is,
yes.
someone
could
come
to
connecticut
and
stay
there,
and
if
the
board
was
satisfied
with
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
connecticut
could
change
its
rule
and
require
more
about
way
of
residence
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
cannot
require
a
citizen.
it
can
require
more
by
way
of
residency
than
it
does.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
that
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
is
the
way
the
rule
is
written,
yes,
your
honor.
i
did
not
write
the
rule
nor
do
i
say
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
is
the
statement
of
the
rule
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
that
is
not
a
constitutional
requirement.
now
in
this
case
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
if
the
board
of
bar
examiners
were
satisfied
that
he
met
the
residency
requirement
under
the
facts
that
you
stated,
he
would
be
certified
by
the
board
to
that.
that
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement,
i
deny.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
it.
if
you’re
saying
that
he
comes
from
virginia
for
example
to
connecticut
and
establishes
residency
under
the
minimum
requirements
the
state
of
connecticut
presently
has,
and
he
should
be
able
to
do
that
with
a
resident
alien
status
from
canada.
yes,
i
am
saying
that
because
that’s
the
connecticut
rule,
but
i’m
not
saying
that
this
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
it
is
not.
they
could
establish
i
think
a
longer
residency
requirement
and
stricter
standards
for
residency.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
in
no
event
--
may
they
condition
it
on
being
a
citizen.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
with
regard
to
constitutional
considerations
by
a
bar
examining
committee?
mr.
r.
david
broiles
my
client,
as
a
resident
alien,
a
permanent
resident
alien
may
reside
in
the
united
states
indefinitely.
she
is
subject
to
the
laws
of
that
right
on
conditions
that
do
not
apply
to
citizens.
if
she
is
guilty
of
conduct
that
is
prescribed
by
the
federal
statute,
you
know,
habitual
drunkenness,
they
are
spelled
out
in
immigration
naturalization,
she
could
still
be
subject
to
deportation.
they
are
certainly
less
stringent
rules
than
one
would
expect
of
a
bar
association,
so
that
were
she
guilty
of
those
same
acts
and
misconduct,
she
should
certainly
be
disbarred
before
she
is
deported.
but
she
is
permanently
has
a
right
to
be
here
under
the
present
statutory
scheme.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
your
honor.
she
in
fact
got
that
status
before
she
married
a
united
states
citizen.
the
--
by
virtue
or
the
fact
of
marrying
a
united
states
citizen,
she
achieves
one
thing
that
she
did
not
have
earlier
and
that
is
that
she
could
become
a
united
states
citizen
in
three
years
rather
than
five
years.
but
she
got
her
permanent
resident
status
prior
to
marrying
a
united
states
citizen.
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
one
inquiry
raised
by
the
brief
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
that
is
that
graham
versus
richardson
does
not
apply
in
this
case
with
regard
to
the
standard.
that
the
classification
based
on
alienage
is
subject
to
strict
judicial
scrutiny
and
that
the
state
of
connecticut
must
show
a
compelling
interest
that
this
classification
is
necessary
to
me.
this
is
stated
on
page
5
of
the
brief
of
the
state
of
connecticut
where
it
is
held
that
no
inquiry
beyond
reasonableness
is
really
needed.
the
reason
that
an
alienage
classification
does
receive
special
scrutiny,
namely
the
alien’s
non
participation
in
government
fails
here
because
the
non
participation
is
a
purpose
served
by
the
classification.
as
i
understand
that
statement,
the
state
of
connecticut
is
saying
that
graham
does
not
apply
because
of
the
fact
that
the
very
exclusion
of
aliens
from
the
process
of
government
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
i
would
take
it
that
what
they
mean
is
that
if
aliens
have
the
right
to
vote,
there
would
be
no
holding
by
this
court
but
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
all
such
classifications
are
subject
to
strict
judicial
scrutiny.
i
would
point
out
two
examples
where
this
is
not
the
case.
that
is
that
the
franchise
or
the
right
to
vote
is
not
the
purpose
for
the
strict
judicial
scrutiny
rule.
children
cannot
vote
and
to
my
knowledge,
this
court
has
not
said,
that
by
virtue
thereof
all
classifications
with
regard
to
children
are
subject
to
the
standard
in
graham,
a
strict
judicial
scrutiny
of
a
necessary
and
compelling
interest.
secondly,
convicted
felons
cannot
vote
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
this
court
would
seriously
entertain
an
attack

crime
control
gun
provisions,
that
govern
felons’
possessions
of
registered
and
unregistered
firearms
on
the
grounds
that
they
cannot
vote.
the
reason
that
classifications
based
on
alienage
are
subject
to
the
strict
judicial
scrutiny
is
because
of
their
analogous
characteristic
to
racial
classifications
and
classifications
based
on
sex.
the
state
of
connecticut
has
to
show
a
compelling
interest
that’s
furthered
by
this
classification
and
that
the
means
are
necessary
to
further
this
classification.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
would
--
it
would
not
necessarily
outlaw
it,
but
i
will
it
this
way
your
honor.
the
question
would
be
could
a
prohibition
as
all
the
states
have,
against
voting
by
aliens
withstand
the
test
of
graham,
that
it
need
a
strict
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
that
it
cannot.
i
think
that
under
the
holding
in
graham,
that
the
fact
that
an
alien
suffers
the
disabilities
must
pay
the
taxes,
must
be
subject
to
all
the
laws
of
the
government,
would
be
a
strong
argument
and
that
a
strong
constitutional
argument
i
point
in.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
that
on
the
facts
as
i
understand,
it
would
prevail,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
would
take
that
would
one
reason.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
would
say,
it
would
make
my
case
more
troublesome
to
answer
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
i
think
so,
both.
whether
yes
and
no
by
some
examples
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
under
--
even
if
the
court
went
as
far
as
mr.
justice
white
as
said
that
these
rules
might
compel
it
there
is
still
a
difference
between
an
alien
and
a
citizen.
the
fourteenth
amendment
talks
about
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizenship.
a
citizen
by
the
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
the
privilege
permanently
to
reside
in
the
state
as
a
citizen
of
that
state,
no
matter
what
his
conduct
maybe,
and
is
immune
from
the
laws
of
citizenship,
or
from
deportation
from
the
united
states,
no
matter
what
his
conduct
maybe
or
what
we
may
think
of
him.
that
is
not
the
case.
that
is
not
a
privilege
or
immunity
of
an
alien.
an
alien
is
entitled
only
to
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
due
process
or
from
deportation?
mr.
r.
david
broiles
a
state
cannot
take
away
if
he
is
entitled,
cannot
have
that
taken
away.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
true,
state
cannot
chase
him
out.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
realize
the
constitution
is
fully
distinguishable.
there
are
jobs
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
would
have
to
meet
the
test
that’s
laid
down
in
graham
of
showing
a
compelling
interest,
yes.
that
is
not
the
case
that
has
to
be
decided
here.
what
the
record
might
show
with
regard
the
voting
is
another
matter.
what
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
with
regard
to
attorneys
is
quite
different.
this
case
is
one
step
removed
from
the
decision
you
must
make
in
the
case
that
was
argued
yesterday,
sugarman.
we
do
not
concede
that
our
client
has
the
status
of
a
governmental
official.
she
is
not
asking
to
be
a
member
in
the
government.
she
is
asking
to
be
an
attorney
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
the
state
seeks
to
analogize
her
to
a
governmental
official.
they
seek
to
analogize
her
by
a
virtue
of
the
position
that
she
would
hold
as
an
attorney
in
connecticut,
as
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court.
the
state
argues
this
on
what
they
call
a
self-evident
proposition
that
after
all,
the
government
of
the
state
of
connecticut
has
a
right
to
limit
its
positions
to
citizens
thereof.
in
fact,
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
limit
positions
for
attorneys
or
commissioners
of
superior
courts
to
citizens
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
i
am
both
an
attorney
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
i
am
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court,
i
cannot
vote
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
i
am
not
a
resident
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
and
yet
i
have
all
of
these
positions
that
they
seek
to
deny
my
client
on
the
grounds
that
she
is
not
a
citizen.
the
difference
is
that
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
compel
citizenship
of
connecticut,
the
state
of
connecticut
compels
citizenship
of
the
united
states.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
the
practitioner
as
an
attorney
takes
the
oath
that
he
will
not
be
guilty
of
any
malice
or
take
anybody's
money
without
just
representation
or
allow
any
fraud
to
be
perpetuated
on
the
court.
the
significant
oath
is
called
the
oath
of
the
commissioner’s
court
or
the
superior
court
and
that
oath
is
i
will
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
connecticut
so
long
as
i
remain
a
citizen
thereof.
that’s
the
connecticut
statute
in
section
125.(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
so
long
as
i
remain
a
citizen
thereof.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
the
oaths
certainly
mean
something.
it’s
a
symbol
that
one
is
going
to
do
just
precisely
what
they
say.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct
your
honor.
obviously,
i’m
no
longer
a
citizen
thereof
and
still
have
all
the
positions
of
an
attorney.
that
does
not
make
the
oath
meaningless
when
i
take
it.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
we
have
suggested
that
this
very
statute
in
question
provides
for
an
alternative
vote
and
that
she
should
be
required
to
take
the
oath
that
she
will
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
connecticut.
so
long
she
remains
a
citizen
thereof,
obviously,
she
can’t
assert
that,
that
can’t
be
a
meaningful
part
of
the
oath
for
someone
who’s
not
a
citizen
of
either
one.
in
the
alternative,
if
the
state
of
connecticut
which
has
not
ruled
on
the
possibility
of
a
judge
changing
the
oath,
and
the
power
to
administer
alternative
oath
is
vested
in
the
judiciary.
if
they
will
not
change
the
oath,
then
under
the
argument,
the
oath
would
have
to
be
unconstitutional.
because
it
would
just
be
another
way
of
requiring
that
all
applicants
for
admission
to
the
bar
be
citizens.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
it
is
your
honor.
the
--
i’m
sorry,
the
form
of
the
oath
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
--
is
in
the
supplemental,
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
page
44
on
my
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
page
44,
that
is
the
oath
of
the
attorney.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
there
is
your
honor.
that
is
the
problem.
if
my
client
takes
the
oath
as
required
under
the
naturalization
act,
she
will
lose
her
dutch
citizenship.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
you
can
your
honor
and
as
stated
throughout
that
she
will
take
both
of
the
oaths
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct.
that’s
the
only
restriction
i
meant
to
imply.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
and
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
if
you’re
asking
me
to
speculate
on
that,
there
would
seem
to
be
that
possibility
yes.
certainly,
if
this
oath
were
taken
after
the
declaration
of
war
between
the
two
countries
that
would
be
a
strong
presumption.
that
it
will
be
taken
before
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
it
she
would
really
have
to
make
an
election
at
that
time,
yes
your
honor.
we’re
not
saying
the
fact
of
alienage
is
totally
irrelevant
as
a
clue.
that
the
bar
character
committee
can
consider
in
passing
on
applications.
we’re
saying
that
an
across
the
board
prohibition
against
aliens
does
not
meet
the
standard,
laid
down
in
graham
of
furthering
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
we
think
that
alienage
has
very
little
to
do
character.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
in
some
you
know
--
i
certainly
tend
to
agree
with
you.
i
think
alienage
is
totally
irrelevant
to
admission
to
the
bar.
obviously,
four
other
states
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
use
the
term
character
possibly
broader
than
your
honor
does
and
that
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
decisions,
there
are
two
general
classifications;
competence
and
character.
now,
in
baird,
in
law
student’s
research
council,
what
you
classified
under
the
character
included
inquiries
into
political
beliefs
and
loyalty.
now,
what
we
are
obviously
talking
about
here,
when
we
talk
about
citizenship
and
non-citizenship
has
something
to
do
with
allegiance
as
mr.
justice
white
has
averted
to
numerous
times.
that’s
what
i
mean
when
i
say
it
falls
under
character.
we’re
talking
about
the
types
of
things
dealing
with
loyalty
oaths
which
is
precisely
what
this
court
has
dealt
with,
with
regard
to
admission
to
the
bar.
can
she
contentiously
take
that
oath?
the
answer
is
yes.
it
is
never
been
disputed
that.
she
can
contentiously
take
the
oath.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
she
may
elect
united
states
citizenship
on
that
contingency.
i
don’t
know
what
she
will
do
on
that
contingency
(voice
overlap)
then
obviously,
she
will
have
her
--
this
government
were
at
war
with
the
netherlands.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
do
you
know
in
advance
what
she
might
elect
with
regard
to
contingencies
concerning
wars
in
the
united
states.
i
don’t
think
any
of
us
can
predict
those
contingencies
forever
in
the
future.
i
think
that’s
a
contingency
not
all
together
unique
to
an
alien
or
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
is
correct.
that
what
is
the
state
of
connecticut
is
saying.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
applies
to
all
resident
aliens.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
applies
to
all
--
yes
your
honor.
it
applies
to
one
who
has
filed
a
declaration
of
intent
to
be
a
citizen.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
i
would.
in
fact,
this
case
was
brought
before
any
knowledge
of
the
graham
case.
it
was
filed
in
1970
before
graham
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court
and
graham
was
decided
by
this
court
after
it
was
appealed
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
it
follows
from
the
truax
decision.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
don’t
see
any
inconsistency
between
truax
and
graham
and
i
think
those
are
the
main
cases
that
interpret
the
fourteenth
amendment
this
way.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
you
do
not
have
to
rely
exclusively
on
graham.
thank
you.

it

acquired

she
continued
to
work
in

and
was
married
in
1967,
and
moved
to
washington,
d.c.
after
residing
in
washington,
d.c.
approximately
two
years,
she
moved
to
new
haven,
connecticut
where
she
was
admitted
to
yale
law
school
as
a
second
year
law
student.
she
completed
her
studies
for
an
llb
degree
at
yale
law
school
and
graduated
from
yale
law
school
in
june
of
1969.
she
has
the
equivalent
of
a
ba
in
law
from
the
university
of
leiden
in
the
netherlands,
and
llb
in
law
from
the
university
of

netherlands,
and
an
llb
in

from

university
in

connecticut.
she
is
concededly,
in
all
respects,
qualified
for
admission
to
the
bar
examination
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
but
for
the
fact
that
rule
8
(1)
of
the
superior
court
rules
of
the
state
of
connecticut
requires
that
all
applicants
for
admission

is
not

and
did
not
at
the
time
for
application
intend
to
become
a
citizen
of

she
was
at
the
time
of
her
application,
a
resident
within
the
residency
requirements
of
the
state
of
connecticut
for
admission
to
the
bar.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
this
was
the
fourth
hearing
that
we’ve
attended
and
you’re
the
first
person
to
ask.
the
record
does
not
so
indicate
why
she
does
not
intend
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
if
you
like
for
me
to
give
you
the
reason,
i
would
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
the
record
does
not
show
whether
she
intends
to
remain
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
she
was
not
asked
that
question.
she
in
fact,
does
intend
to
reside
in
the
united
states
as
with
her
husband.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
and
she
does
intend
to
reside
in
the
united
states
indefinitely.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
she
does
not
at
this
time
intend
to
become
a
citizen.
her
feeling
is
that
after
25
years
of
living
in
holland
that
she
cannot
give
that
up
at
this
particular
time.
dual
citizenship
is
not
a
possibility.
it
would
be
as
if
we
immigrated
to
holland,
say
we
married
a
dutch
citizen
and
i
was
living
in
holland
and
my
wife
was
working
there,
and
in
order
to
practice
my
profession
as
a
lawyer,
i
was
required
to
give
up
my
citizenship
in
the
united
states.
my
failure
to
do
that
and
i
would
not
give
up
my
citizenship
in
the
united
states
to
be
a
dutch
citizen
would
not
be
because
of
any
lack
of
loyalty
to
holland,
where
i’m
resident
thereof
or
because
i
intended
to
violate
any
laws
of
holland
or
because
i
could
not
abide
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
holland.
it
will
be
because
of
the
feeling
that
i
have
after
having
my
family
and
resided
in
the
united
states
for
25
years.
that
sort
of
personal
feeling
is
what
mrs.
griffiths
has
and
she
doesn’t
feel
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no
there
are
contingencies
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
it
is
not
what
connecticut
is
trying
to
get
at.
connecticut
--
people
have
personal
feelings,
for
example,
with
regards
to
their
citizenship
in
the
state
in
the
united
states,
by
the
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
have
a
dual
citizenship
to
a
state
and
to
the
united
states
if
we
are
a
citizens
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
well,
to
contingency
--
if
you’re
asking,
is
there
a
contingency
that
she
might
go
back
to
holland.
that
contingency,
in
fact,
exists
as
much
as
the
contingency
that
someone
born
in
california,
who
is
admitted
to
practice
law
in
connecticut,
might
go
back
to
california,
that
someone
who’s
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
might
choose
to
re-announce
their
united
states
citizenship
and
move
to
israel.
that
someone
might
die,
that
someone
might
commit
a
breach
to
the
canons
of
ethics
as
a
member
of
the
bar
and
be
disqualified.
there
are
all
sorts
of
disabling
contingencies
that
one
can
have
and
certainly
one
of
them
would
be
that
she
can
go
to
holland.
that’s
a
contingency
that
her
husband
also
is
subject
to,
that
anyone
would
be
subject
to
in
leaving
united
states.
i
do
not
think
it
is
what
the
state
of
connecticut
is
getting
at
by
requiring
united
states
citizenship
of
all
members
or
applicants
to
the
bar
though.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
i
would
not
have
a
right
to
be
a
judge
in
holland
though
it
is
interesting
that
my
client,
who
is
not
a
citizen
to
united
states,
and
is
a
citizen
of
holland,
would
on
our
research,
have
a
right
to
be
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
our
research
tells
me
that
in
holland
that
is
not
the
case.
i’m
telling
you
what
my
client
tells
me
about
dutch
law.
i
don’t
purport
to
know
anything
about
it
other
than
that.
we
have
not
found
any
disabling
provisions
for
an
alien
to
be
a
united
states
district
court
judge
or
to
be
on
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
there’s
no
requirement
that
a
justice
on
the
supreme
court
be
a
lawyer.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
according
to
my
client,
i
could
not.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
without
being
a
dutch
citizen.
our
research
shows
that
there
are
very
few
countries
that
allow
what
one
would
call
reciprocity
without
the
requirement
of
citizenship.
one
of
the
few
being
japan,
and
it
is
apparently
possible
in
england,
but
it
is
not
possible
according
to
her
in
holland.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
she
is
presently
living
in
holland
and
is
coming
back
thursday
and
has
the
intention
of
practicing
in
connecticut
if
this
opinion
is
favorable
to
her.
she
went
to
holland
and
have
a
child.
she
now
has,
since
the
beginning
of
this
lawsuit
has
had
two
children.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no
it
is
not
your
honor.
there
is
no
residency
requirement
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
rule
8
(2)
requires
that
you
have
an
intention
to
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut
which
she
has.
at
the
time
the
case
was
brought
up
to
court,
she’d
been
a
resident
of
connecticut
for
two
years.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
it
means,
an
intent
to
reside
in
connecticut
so
long
as
it
takes
to
become
a
member
of
the
bar.
once
one
has
become
a
member
of
the
bar,
you
need
no
longer
to
have
to
that
intent.
for
example
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
residency
means
living
there.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
just
being
there.
i,
for
example,
i’m
a
member
of
the
connecticut
bar,
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
connecticut
as
i
stand
here
right
now.
i
have
not
resided
in
the
state
of
connecticut
for
two
years.
i
have
been
to
connecticut
only
twice
in
those
two
years,
both
times
in
connection
with
this
lawsuit.
i
became
a
member
of
the
bar
at
the
state
of
connecticut
after
my
graduation
from
a
law
school
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
no
questions
were
asked
to
me
and
no
questions
are
required
by
the
rules
in
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
connecticut
that
i
intend
to
permanently
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
rule
8
(2)
says,
“you
must
either
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut
or
intend
to
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut.”
it
does
not
require
an
intention
to
permanently
reside
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
i
recently
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
residence
in
fact
does
mean
just
that.
that
you
are
at
the
time
you
make
application
for
the
admission
to
the
bar,
have
the
intention
to
reside.
i
take
it
domicile
to
mean
actually
physically
be
present.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
would
not.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
domicile
intents
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes,
i
don’t
think
the
intent
can
reasonably
said
to
be
indefinitely.
the
intent
must
be
to
stay
there
having
no
particular
plans
to
leave
at
this
time
to
go
some
place
else.
this
is
where
i
am
now.
i’m
not
definitely
living
some
place
else.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no
i
don’t
think
so.
i
don’t
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
based
on
the
rules
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
that
is
quite
right.
that’s
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no
that’s
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
that’s
absolutely
not
the
position
here.
one
has
to
take
--
one
has
not
only
fill
out
the
questionnaire
but
be
interviewed
by
the
bar
committee.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
and
the
bar
committee
is
satisfied
to
these
qualifications.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
as
to
his
residency
in
the
state
of
connecticut
then
it
seems
clear
under
the
rule
of
the
state
of
connecticut
that
he’s
admissible.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i’m
saying
that
that’s
what
the
rule
of
the
state
of
connecticut
requires.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
is
not
my
position.
the
constitution
does
not
require
that.
the
original
question
asked
by
you
was
with
regard
there
was
not
the
purpose
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
residency,
if
the
people
were
residents
of
the
state
in
which
they
were
lawyers.
in
fact,
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
require
more
than
what
you
have
described.
if
the
state
of
connecticut
were
to
just
require
a
six-month
residency
requirement
that
may
work
well
withstand
the
test
of
constitutionality.
the
new
mexico
case
which
you
recently
denied
cert
on
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
does
not.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
connecticut
could
require
constitutionally.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
has
not.
if
this
case,
does
come
down
to
my
client
on
the
connecticut
rule
qualify
because
she
wasn’t
back
in
the
connecticut
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
bar
examiners,
a
resident
under
that
rule.
that
has
been
so
found
and
it
is
not
disputed.
that
connecticut
has
no
further
requirements
other
than
domicile
or
intention
to
be
a
resident.
in
this
case
is,
yes.
someone
could
come
to
connecticut
and
stay
there,
and
if
the
board
was
satisfied
with
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
connecticut
could
change
its
rule
and
require
more
about
way
of
residence
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
cannot
require
a
citizen.
it
can
require
more
by
way
of
residency
than
it
does.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
that
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
is
the
way
the
rule
is
written,
yes,
your
honor.
i
did
not
write
the
rule
nor
do
i
say
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
is
the
statement
of
the
rule
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
that
is
not
a
constitutional
requirement.
now
in
this
case
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
if
the
board
of
bar
examiners
were
satisfied
that
he
met
the
residency
requirement
under
the
facts
that
you
stated,
he
would
be
certified
by
the
board
to
that.
that
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement,
i
deny.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
it.
if
you’re
saying
that
he
comes
from
virginia
for
example
to
connecticut
and
establishes
residency
under
the
minimum
requirements
the
state
of
connecticut
presently
has,
and
he
should
be
able
to
do
that
with
a
resident
alien
status
from
canada.
yes,
i
am
saying
that
because
that’s
the
connecticut
rule,
but
i’m
not
saying
that
this
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
it
is
not.
they
could
establish
i
think
a
longer
residency
requirement
and
stricter
standards
for
residency.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
in
no
event
--
may
they
condition
it
on
being
a
citizen.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
with
regard
to
constitutional
considerations
by
a
bar
examining
committee?
mr.
r.
david
broiles
my
client,
as
a
resident
alien,
a
permanent
resident
alien
may
reside
in
the
united
states
indefinitely.
she
is
subject
to
the
laws
of
that
right
on
conditions
that
do
not
apply
to
citizens.
if
she
is
guilty
of
conduct
that
is
prescribed
by
the
federal
statute,
you
know,
habitual
drunkenness,
they
are
spelled
out
in
immigration
naturalization,
she
could
still
be
subject
to
deportation.
they
are
certainly
less
stringent
rules
than
one
would
expect
of
a
bar
association,
so
that
were
she
guilty
of
those
same
acts
and
misconduct,
she
should
certainly
be
disbarred
before
she
is
deported.
but
she
is
permanently
has
a
right
to
be
here
under
the
present
statutory
scheme.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
your
honor.
she
in
fact
got
that
status
before
she
married
a
united
states
citizen.
the
--
by
virtue
or
the
fact
of
marrying
a
united
states
citizen,
she
achieves
one
thing
that
she
did
not
have
earlier
and
that
is
that
she
could
become
a
united
states
citizen
in
three
years
rather
than
five
years.
but
she
got
her
permanent
resident
status
prior
to
marrying
a
united
states
citizen.
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
one
inquiry
raised
by
the
brief
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
that
is
that
graham
versus
richardson
does
not
apply
in
this
case
with
regard
to
the
standard.
that
the
classification
based
on
alienage
is
subject
to
strict
judicial
scrutiny
and
that
the
state
of
connecticut
must
show
a
compelling
interest
that
this
classification
is
necessary
to
me.
this
is
stated
on
page
5
of
the
brief
of
the
state
of
connecticut
where
it
is
held
that
no
inquiry
beyond
reasonableness
is
really
needed.
the
reason
that
an
alienage
classification
does
receive
special
scrutiny,
namely
the
alien’s
non
participation
in
government
fails
here
because
the
non
participation
is
a
purpose
served
by
the
classification.
as
i
understand
that
statement,
the
state
of
connecticut
is
saying
that
graham
does
not
apply
because
of
the
fact
that
the
very
exclusion
of
aliens
from
the
process
of
government
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
i
would
take
it
that
what
they
mean
is
that
if
aliens
have
the
right
to
vote,
there
would
be
no
holding
by
this
court
but
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
all
such
classifications
are
subject
to
strict
judicial
scrutiny.
i
would
point
out
two
examples
where
this
is
not
the
case.
that
is
that
the
franchise
or
the
right
to
vote
is
not
the
purpose
for
the
strict
judicial
scrutiny
rule.
children
cannot
vote
and
to
my
knowledge,
this
court
has
not
said,
that
by
virtue
thereof
all
classifications
with
regard
to
children
are
subject
to
the
standard
in
graham,
a
strict
judicial
scrutiny
of
a
necessary
and
compelling
interest.
secondly,
convicted
felons
cannot
vote
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
this
court
would
seriously
entertain
an
attack
on
the
1968
crime
control
gun
provisions,
that
govern
felons’
possessions
of
registered
and
unregistered
firearms
on
the
grounds
that
they
cannot
vote.
the
reason
that
classifications
based
on
alienage
are
subject
to
the
strict
judicial
scrutiny
is
because
of
their
analogous
characteristic
to
racial
classifications
and
classifications
based
on
sex.
the
state
of
connecticut
has
to
show
a
compelling
interest
that’s
furthered
by
this
classification
and
that
the
means
are
necessary
to
further
this
classification.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
would
--
it
would
not
necessarily
outlaw
it,
but
i
will
it
this
way
your
honor.
the
question
would
be
could
a
prohibition
as
all
the
states
have,
against
voting
by
aliens
withstand
the
test
of
graham,
that
it
need
a
strict
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
that
it
cannot.
i
think
that
under
the
holding
in
graham,
that
the
fact
that
an
alien
suffers
the
disabilities
must
pay
the
taxes,
must
be
subject
to
all
the
laws
of
the
government,
would
be
a
strong
argument
and
that
a
strong
constitutional
argument
i
point
in.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
that
on
the
facts
as
i
understand,
it
would
prevail,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
would
take
that
would
one
reason.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
would
say,
it
would
make
my
case
more
troublesome
to
answer
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
no,
i
think
so,
both.
whether
yes
and
no
by
some
examples
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
under
--
even
if
the
court
went
as
far
as
mr.
justice
white
as
said
that
these
rules
might
compel
it
there
is
still
a
difference
between
an
alien
and
a
citizen.
the
fourteenth
amendment
talks
about
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizenship.
a
citizen
by
the
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
the
privilege
permanently
to
reside
in
the
state
as
a
citizen
of
that
state,
no
matter
what
his
conduct
maybe,
and
is
immune
from
the
laws
of
citizenship,
or
from
deportation
from
the
united
states,
no
matter
what
his
conduct
maybe
or
what
we
may
think
of
him.
that
is
not
the
case.
that
is
not
a
privilege
or
immunity
of
an
alien.
an
alien
is
entitled
only
to
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
due
process
or
from
deportation?
mr.
r.
david
broiles
a
state
cannot
take
away
if
he
is
entitled,
cannot
have
that
taken
away.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
true,
state
cannot
chase
him
out.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
realize
the
constitution
is
fully
distinguishable.
there
are
jobs
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
would
have
to
meet
the
test
that’s
laid
down
in
graham
of
showing
a
compelling
interest,
yes.
that
is
not
the
case
that
has
to
be
decided
here.
what
the
record
might
show
with
regard
the
voting
is
another
matter.
what
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
with
regard
to
attorneys
is
quite
different.
this
case
is
one
step
removed
from
the
decision
you
must
make
in
the
case
that
was
argued
yesterday,
sugarman.
we
do
not
concede
that
our
client
has
the
status
of
a
governmental
official.
she
is
not
asking
to
be
a
member
in
the
government.
she
is
asking
to
be
an
attorney
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
the
state
seeks
to
analogize
her
to
a
governmental
official.
they
seek
to
analogize
her
by
a
virtue
of
the
position
that
she
would
hold
as
an
attorney
in
connecticut,
as
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court.
the
state
argues
this
on
what
they
call
a
self-evident
proposition
that
after
all,
the
government
of
the
state
of
connecticut
has
a
right
to
limit
its
positions
to
citizens
thereof.
in
fact,
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
limit
positions
for
attorneys
or
commissioners
of
superior
courts
to
citizens
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
i
am
both
an
attorney
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
i
am
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court,
i
cannot
vote
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
i
am
not
a
resident
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
and
yet
i
have
all
of
these
positions
that
they
seek
to
deny
my
client
on
the
grounds
that
she
is
not
a
citizen.
the
difference
is
that
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
compel
citizenship
of
connecticut,
the
state
of
connecticut
compels
citizenship
of
the
united
states.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
the
practitioner
as
an
attorney
takes
the
oath
that
he
will
not
be
guilty
of
any
malice
or
take
anybody's
money
without
just
representation
or
allow
any
fraud
to
be
perpetuated
on
the
court.
the
significant
oath
is
called
the
oath
of
the
commissioner’s
court
or
the
superior
court
and
that
oath
is
i
will
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
connecticut
so
long
as
i
remain
a
citizen
thereof.
that’s
the
connecticut
statute
in
section
125.(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
so
long
as
i
remain
a
citizen
thereof.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
the
oaths
certainly
mean
something.
it’s
a
symbol
that
one
is
going
to
do
just
precisely
what
they
say.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct
your
honor.
obviously,
i’m
no
longer
a
citizen
thereof
and
still
have
all
the
positions
of
an
attorney.
that
does
not
make
the
oath
meaningless
when
i
take
it.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
we
have
suggested
that
this
very
statute
in
question
provides
for
an
alternative
vote
and
that
she
should
be
required
to
take
the
oath
that
she
will
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
connecticut.
so
long
she
remains
a
citizen
thereof,
obviously,
she
can’t
assert
that,
that
can’t
be
a
meaningful
part
of
the
oath
for
someone
who’s
not
a
citizen
of
either
one.
in
the
alternative,
if
the
state
of
connecticut
which
has
not
ruled
on
the
possibility
of
a
judge
changing
the
oath,
and
the
power
to
administer
alternative
oath
is
vested
in
the
judiciary.
if
they
will
not
change
the
oath,
then
under
the
argument,
the
oath
would
have
to
be
unconstitutional.
because
it
would
just
be
another
way
of
requiring
that
all
applicants
for
admission
to
the
bar
be
citizens.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
it
is
your
honor.
the
--
i’m
sorry,
the
form
of
the
oath
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
--
is
in
the
supplemental,
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
page

on
my
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
page

that
is
the
oath
of
the
attorney.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
there
is
your
honor.
that
is
the
problem.
if
my
client
takes
the
oath
as
required
under
the
naturalization
act,
she
will
lose
her
dutch
citizenship.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
you
can
your
honor
and
as
stated
throughout
that
she
will
take
both
of
the
oaths
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that’s
correct.
that’s
the
only
restriction
i
meant
to
imply.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
and
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
if
you’re
asking
me
to
speculate
on
that,
there
would
seem
to
be
that
possibility
yes.
certainly,
if
this
oath
were
taken
after
the
declaration
of
war
between
the
two
countries
that
would
be
a
strong
presumption.
that
it
will
be
taken
before
--
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
think
it
she
would
really
have
to
make
an
election
at
that
time,
yes
your
honor.
we’re
not
saying
the
fact
of
alienage
is
totally
irrelevant
as
a
clue.
that
the
bar
character
committee
can
consider
in
passing
on
applications.
we’re
saying
that
an
across
the
board
prohibition
against
aliens
does
not
meet
the
standard,
laid
down
in
graham
of
furthering
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
we
think
that
alienage
has
very
little
to
do
character.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
in
some
you
know
--
i
certainly
tend
to
agree
with
you.
i
think
alienage
is
totally
irrelevant
to
admission
to
the
bar.
obviously,
four
other
states
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
use
the
term
character
possibly
broader
than
your
honor
does
and
that
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
decisions,
there
are
two
general
classifications;
competence
and
character.
now,
in
baird,
in
law
student’s
research
council,
what
you
classified
under
the
character
included
inquiries
into
political
beliefs
and
loyalty.
now,
what
we
are
obviously
talking
about
here,
when
we
talk
about
citizenship
and
non-citizenship
has
something
to
do
with
allegiance
as
mr.
justice
white
has
averted
to
numerous
times.
that’s
what
i
mean
when
i
say
it
falls
under
character.
we’re
talking
about
the
types
of
things
dealing
with
loyalty
oaths
which
is
precisely
what
this
court
has
dealt
with,
with
regard
to
admission
to
the
bar.
can
she
contentiously
take
that
oath?
the
answer
is
yes.
it
is
never
been
disputed
that.
she
can
contentiously
take
the
oath.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
she
may
elect
united
states
citizenship
on
that
contingency.
i
don’t
know
what
she
will
do
on
that
contingency
(voice
overlap)
then
obviously,
she
will
have
her
--
this
government
were
at
war
with
the
netherlands.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
do
you
know
in
advance
what
she
might
elect
with
regard
to
contingencies
concerning
wars
in
the
united
states.
i
don’t
think
any
of
us
can
predict
those
contingencies
forever
in
the
future.
i
think
that’s
a
contingency
not
all
together
unique
to
an
alien
or
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
david
broiles
that
is
correct.
that
what
is
the
state
of
connecticut
is
saying.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
applies
to
all
resident
aliens.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
it
applies
to
all
--
yes
your
honor.
it
applies
to
one
who
has
filed
a
declaration
of
intent
to
be
a
citizen.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
yes
i
would.
in
fact,
this
case
was
brought
before
any
knowledge
of
the
graham
case.
it
was
filed
in
1970
before
graham
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court
and
graham
was
decided
by
this
court
after
it
was
appealed
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
it
follows
from
the
truax
decision.
mr.
r.
david
broiles
i
don’t
see
any
inconsistency
between
truax
and
graham
and
i
think
those
are
the
main
cases
that
interpret
the
fourteenth
amendment
this
way.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
you
do
not
have
to
rely
exclusively
on
graham.
thank
you.
