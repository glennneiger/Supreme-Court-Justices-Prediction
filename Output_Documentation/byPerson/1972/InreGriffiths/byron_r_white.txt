justice
byron
r.
white
we’re
going
to
the
constitution
(inaudible)
need
to
be
lawyers?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
an
intent
to
reside
that
means
an
intent
to
live
in
connecticut
and
indefinitely.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
have
an
intent?
what
does
residency
mean
in
connecticut?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
being
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
--
residency
doesn’t
even
mean
that
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
just
move
to
connecticut
for
long
after
you
take
the
exam
and
leave?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
so
required
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
no
event,
they
can
condition
it
being
a
citizen?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
would
your
position
necessarily
outlaw
the
exclusion
of
aliens
from
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
that
one
that
you
think
should
be
prevail?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
if
the
voting
restriction
were
to
be
sustained,
i
presume
it
might
be
connected
with
the
idea
of
excluding
aliens
from
the
processes
of
government
and
decision
making?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
that
were
to
be
sustained,
you
might
be
in
more
trouble
--
that
you
would
have
a
troublesome
case
here,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he’s
entitled
to
those
same
rights
as
it
gives
the
state,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
what
you
just
said,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
state
can’t
chase
him
out
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
oath
does
the
--
does
the
practitioner
in
connecticut
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
long
as
you
remain
the
citizen?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don’t,
so
the
oath
means
nothing.
(inaudible)
for
an
alien?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
only
applies
as
long
as
you’re
a
citizen?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
rule
in
the
holland
that
governs
the
citizens
that
they
should
not
take
oaths
of
foreign
governments
under
foreign
constitutions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
she
--
what
if
she,
things
like
when
she
swear
to
support
the
constitution
in
the
united
states
consistent
with
the
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
restriction
in
holland
that
if
you
take
an
oath
of
--
if
you
become
a
citizen
of
a
foreign
state,
you
lose
your
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
swear
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
suppose
that
united
states
were
at
war.
now,
i
suppose
by
swearing
to
support
the
constitution
of
united
states,
you
might
be
treating
it
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
her
oath
here,
she
prefers
her
dutch
citizenship
to
american
citizenship
and
that’s
pretty
clear
in
this
case.
that’s
clear
in
this
case,
and
in
the
time
of
war
to
support
the
constitution
would
be
somewhat
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
she
knows
and
you
know
that
in
one
contingency,
the
oaths
will
mean
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
know
until
it's
too
late?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
what
requirement
for
citizenship
of
connecticut
(inaudible)?
justice
byron

like
how
do
you
become
a

to
the
state
of
connecticut?
