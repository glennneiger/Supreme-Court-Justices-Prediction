justice
thurgood

isn’t
it
true
that
an
existing

alaska,
change
in
new

go
to
new

take
the
exam
and
will
be
admitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
go
right
back
to
anchorage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
if
somebody
came
from
canada,
did
the
same
thing,
he’d
be
entitled
to
the
same
discretion
that
the
person
from
anchorage
had?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
applies
to
everyone
who
happens
to
be
a
resident
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
can
also
applies
to
the
resident
alien
who
has
decided
that
next
year,
i
am
going
to
take
that
citizenship?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
connecticut
law,
a
man
says
“i
intend
to
become
a
citizen,”
is
he
allowed
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
my
question
is,
he
says,
“i
intend”
the
language
of
the
rules
is
“i
intend
to
become
a
citizen,”
could
he
be
admitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
files
his
declaration,
would
he
be
admitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn’t
the
rule
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
becomes
admitted
and
he
withdraws
his
application.
is
he
still
a
member
of
the
bar
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
bar.
justice
thurgood
marshall
until
when?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
to
then
become
a
citizen
before
he
could
come
to
the
bar.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
can
take
the
exam
on
intent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
think
it
affects
this
case
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
look
at
through
acts
against
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
give
me
that
scholarly
writer?
justice
thurgood

my

was
the

justice
thurgood
marshall
i
couldn’t

either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it

it’s
a
student
comment,
that’s
all
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
scholarly
student’s
comment.
but
what
could
point
to
me
in
truax,
that
says
as
limited
that
in
any
fashion
at
all
and
i
think
you’ll
agree
that
chief
justice
hughes
didn’t
use
broad
language
that
they
can
manage.
he
said
it
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
for
a
state
to
draw
the
line
between
alien
and
the
citizen
in
the
matter
of
employment
and
right
to
make
a
living.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
agree
that
the
state
of
connecticut
could
not
say
that
redhead
people
couldn’t
be
admitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course.

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i’m

why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
an
alien
is
more
dangerous
in
his
private
life
than
a
citizen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
an
alien
is
less

than
a

justice
thurgood

you
don’t
question
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
still
trying
to
get
the
reason.
you
haven’t
at
least
tried
to
satisfy
me
of
any
reason
at
all
except
the
fact
that
she
is
an
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
man
said
he
resides
in
and
he
is
now
a
resident
of
fort
worth,
texas
can
go
up
there
and
serve
one
right
now,
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
he
comes
up
and
serve
one
and
go
back
to
fort
worth
and
that
doesn’t
offend

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
anything?
well
if
a
person

his
united
states
citizenship
five
years
from
now,
does
he
lose
his

membership
in
connecticut?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
this
man
can
--
who
is
sitting
in
there
--mr.
broiles,
could
go
to
netherlands,
live
in
the
netherlands,
take
out
the
netherlands
citizenship
and
he’ll
still
be
able
to
practice
law
in
connecticut.

well,
there’s
nothing
in
the
law
that
says
once
he
loses
his

he
loses
his
right
to
practice

justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
dual

involved
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
don’t
--
she
doesn’t
