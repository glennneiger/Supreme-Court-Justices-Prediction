mr.
george
tiernan
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
members
of
this
court.
the
issue
really
revolves
about
this
point,
that
the
applicant
here
is
seeking
admission
to
take
the
bar
examination
in
connecticut,
hopefully
with
the
final
expectation
of
admission
to
the
bar.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes.
that
she’s
seeking
admission
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
connecticut
on
her
own
terms
to
some
degree
at
least.
when
she
was
examined
before
the
committee,
one
of
the
committees
which
of
course
acts
as
an
agency
for
the
judicial
department
of
the
state,
the
court
to
the
state
in
the
procedure
for
bar
admission
which
of
course
appears
in
the
appendix,
she
was
inquired
of
as
to
her
residence
and
so
forth
beginning
at
page
30.
this
is
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
committee
on
recommendations.
now,
when
the
question
arrived
as
to
her
citizenship,
she
unequivocally
stated
that
she
was
not
and
that
she
had
no
plans
of
becoming
one.
the
inquiry
and
the
interrogations
stopped
at
that
point
by
the
committee.
the
first
question
posed
here
by
the
bench
satisfies
me
that
that
is
a
natural
inquiry
and
to
my
view,
the
first
inquiry.
why
didn’t
someone
ask
why?
now,
of
course,
the
first
and
basic
requirement
of
the
connecticut
rules,
which
has
been
an
effect
for
about
a
century,
is
first,
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
just
prior
to
that,
there
is
a
statement
to
entitle
an
applicant
to
admission
to
the
bar
except
in
section
12.
one
might
very
well
say,
well
what’s
that
exception
is
about.
the
exception
12
merely
refers
to
the
admission
on
motion
from
other
states
by
attorneys
in
the
state
of
this
country.
mr.
george
tiernan
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
mr.
george
tiernan
no,
the
citizen
of
the
united
states,
of
course,
in
order
to
become
a
citizen,
when
you
become
a
citizen
in
the
united
states
of
course,
you
become
a
citizen
of
a
state
that
you
are
presently
where
you
are.
there
is
no
specific
answer.
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
also
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
all
to
allegiance
to
both,
united
states
v.
lanza,
260
u.s
377.
the
case
decided
here
in
1922.
mr.
george
tiernan
no.
mr.
george
tiernan
the
only
requirement
is
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
then
the
second
question
which
was
--
mr.
george
tiernan
that
is
right
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
correct.
that
he
is
a
resident
of
this
state,
or
intends
to
become
such
resident.
now,
of
course,
that
question
was
really
not
followed
at
all
or
inquiry
following
the
unqualified
statement
by
this
applicant
before
a
said
committee
that
she
had
no
intention
of
becoming
a
citizen.
that
was
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
tiernan
well
of
course
the
rule
doesn’t
limit
it
just
to
--
it
says
there,
were
entitled
and
that
applicant
to
the
admission
to
the
bar
and
of
course
only
one
of
the
steps
is
the
citizenship.
now,
the
question
of
whether
a
person
says
i
filed
a
declaration.
mr.
george
tiernan
that
has
not
been
decided,
but
i
presume
that
he
would
not
until
he
evidenced
by
some
direct
manifestations
such
as
filing
a
declaration.
mr.
george
tiernan
that
i
could
not
answer
under
the
specific
rule
but
i
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
tiernan
as
to
residence
of
course,
yes
that’s
right.
one
comprehends
the
other.
mr.
george
tiernan
and
i
have
no
doubt.
mr.
george
tiernan
he
is
admitted
to
what,
to
the
bar
or
to
the
examination?
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
he
couldn’t
be
admitted
to
the
bar
--
mr.
george
tiernan
until
he
is
qualified
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes
sir.
mr.
george
tiernan
on
a
declaration
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
tiernan
no.
mr.
george
tiernan
that’s
a
very
--
that’s
the
vital
question.
that’s
the
vital
question.
may
i
just
introduce.
mr.
george
tiernan
thank
you
very
much.
the
one
thing
occurs
to
me
is
the
fact
of
this
court
does
not
have
any
machinery
for
admission
to
the
bar.
presumably,
that
through
the
history
of
this
court
is
because
they
--
mr.
george
tiernan
i
have
been
accustomed
to
being
heard
on
the
past.
mr.
george
tiernan
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
this
court
derives
its
qualifications
to
right
degree
of
practicing
before
this
court
by
state’s
attendance
presumably
because
they
believe
through
the
past
that
they
are
proficient
enough
to
be
accepted.
and
of
course
the
federal
system
has
no
separate
or
distinct
machinery
for
admitting
people
to
practice
before
us.
now,
one
of
the
basic
rules
of
admission
in
this
court
is
that
the
applicant
for
a
practice
before
this
court
as
today
must
represent
that
they
practiced
in
a
state
of
this
country
for
a
period
of
three
years.
it
would
be
difficult
to
understand
how
a
person
could
make
a
solid
showing
for
a
permission
to
practice
here
on
that
requirement.
because
of
course,
up
until
this
year,
there
was
no
single
state
that
unequivocally
by
decision
decided
or
found
that
citizenship
was
not
required
for
admission
to
the
bar.
now,
in
reference
to
graham
--
mr.
george
tiernan
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes.
yes,
there
are
couple.
mr.
george
tiernan
no
because
under
the
section
13
at
the
rules,
subparagraph
3,
one
of
the
kinds
in
addition
to
his
practice
in
the
other
state
is
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
that
is
common
to
both
non-resident
bar,
those
applying
to
motion
and
those
applying
directly.
mr.
george
tiernan
three
years?
mr.
george
tiernan
of
course,
i
take
it
that
this
issue
is
not
similar
to
the
issues
raise
or
the
factual
situation
raised
in
graham
and
dunn
versus
blumstein
voting
rights.
social
benefits
in
graham
--
because
of
course
in
those
cases,
we
have
a
situation
where
with
reference
to
graham
which
advanced
that
compelling
interest,
state
interest
test
to
be
applied
in
alienage
classifications.
right
there,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
case
distinguished
in
the
situation
there
because
of
course
the
financial
integrity
of
a
state
was
involved
just
as
in
shapiro,
nothing
about
anything
else.
that
was
a
case
where
they
were
trying
to
deprive
the
people
of
visiting
the
state
of
welfare
benefits
undergrounds
of
no
durational
residence
for
citizenship.
and
they
said
that
the
state
had
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest.
that
is
hardly
to
be
i
think
compared
with
admission
to
the
bar
because
of
course
the
reference
that
was
made
to
the
brief
concerning
the
special
judicial
scrutiny
required.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
mere
situation
in
graham
and
the
voting
case
in
graham
and
shapiro,
the
right
to
travel
which
although
doesn’t
appear
specifically
in
the
constitution
has
been
inserted
therein
by
judicial
decision,
and
the
fundamental
right
of
travel
of
people
in
this
country
was
restricted,
says
this
court
in
those
cases.
but
in
the
graham
case,
there
was
a
discussion
concerning
one
of
the
tests
used
in
our
history
of
special
interest
and
in
that
very
case,
graham
on
page
374,
403,
this
court
stated
that
although
the
special
interest
test
was
rejected,
so
far
as
the
social
benefits
were
concerned,
social
benefit
cases
which
of
course
graham
represented,
this
court
specifically
said,
whatever
maybe
the
contemporary
vitality
of
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
and
other
context
at
the
takahashi,
we
conclude
so
forth.
in
other
words,
they
left
open,
this
very
court
left
open
even
the
application
of
a
special
interest
test.
now,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
referred
to
the
--
talked
about
truax
which
of
course
is
the
case
that
obviously
when
this
country
grants
entrance
and
vote
to
an
alien,
obviously,
one
follows
the
other.
the
early
efforts
of
course,
when
this
question
was
raised
from
--
in
this
country
from
a
country
that
once
had
many
aliens,
when
we’re
in
the
formative
stages,
when
that
question
was
raised
here
in
the
--
as
in
to
the
truax
case,
the
court
said
it
was
limited
to
the
right
of
an
alien
to
indulge
in
the
common
occupations
of
men
or
sometimes
it
was
a
common
i
believe
industrial
occupations.
that
has
always
been
interpreted
even
by
writers,
scholarly
writers,
law
writers,
that
that
did
not
include
professions.
now,
incidentally
in
this
connection,
efforts
have
been
made
to
add.
mr.
george
tiernan
the
columbia
law
review,
57
columbia
law
review
10
(12)
at
page
10
(26)
in
1957,
the
title
of
which
is
“the
constitutionality
of
the
restrictions
on
aliens’
rights
to
work.”
mr.
george
tiernan
i
didn’t
have
the
name.
mr.
george
tiernan
that
is
correct
and
that
is
why
i
didn’t
give
you
any
name.
mr.
george
tiernan
no,
it
isn’t.
it’s
a
comment,
i
think.
mr.
george
tiernan
i
don't
know
--
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
there
were
others.
that
was
just
--
mr.
george
tiernan
yes.
but
of
course,
how
can
this
be
considered
as
all
inclusive
and
have
any
meaning
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
how
can
this
be
considered
as
being
all
inclusive
for
all
forms
of
occupational
activity
including
the
professions
when
it's
indicated
classifications
are
permissible
that
must
be
justified.
after
all
even
bar
admission
rules
must
be
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution,
but
how
can
we
ever
permit
any
classifications
as
such
so
far
as
employment
is
concerned,
if
that
is
so?
now,
--
mr.
george
tiernan
i
hope
not.
mr.
george
tiernan
i
don’t
know.
mr.
george
tiernan
why
as
the
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
history
reports
that
when
connecticut
was
saying
no
to
aliens,
they
were
saying
yes
to
women.
now,
i
don’t
know
whether
that
would
be
called
and
that
was
sometime
ago.
mr.
george
tiernan
because
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
court
has
established
by
this
court,
presented,
i
should
say,
by
its
decision
that
because
of
the
status
and
the
position
of
the
lawyer
in
the
state,
there
are
other
conditions
or
qualifications
that
are
required,
citizenship,
residency,
educational
requirements,
they
say,
this
court
stated
that
in
order
to
have
a
system
toward
the
administration
of
justice
and
in
the
public
interest
in
connecticut,
a
lawyer
who
is
called
with
the
right
to
command
actions
by
authority
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
in
connection
with
his
affairs
both
private,
both
public,
and
his
reference
to
individuals
as
a
counselor.
mr.
george
tiernan
no.
mr.
george
tiernan
no,
i
didn’t
say
that.
mr.
george
tiernan
what
you’re
trying
to
say
is
that
alienage
is
an
irrational
classification
per
se.
this
court
has
not
said
so
but
you
have
to
have
the
opportunity
to
say
it
right
now.
mr.
george
tiernan
i’m
backing
up
to
the
court.
in
this
case
in
which
i
represent.
in
connecticut,
the
court
stated
that
because
of
the
position
that
member
of
the
bar
holds
that
citizenship
is
a
requirement,
that
there
is
nothing
irrational
above
the
state
asking
for
that
in
accordance
with
the
precepts
set
down
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
in
the
first
place,
as
one
said
in
--
just
examine
the
duties
of
a
lawyer,
his
relationship
both
to
the
individual,
the
public,
his
connection
with
the
court,
his
involvement
of
the
rules,
his
involvement
of
the
procedure,
and
the
changing
procedure
and
changing
rules,
all
of
this
is
connected
with
the
government.
mr.
george
tiernan
and
there
are
three
degrees.
i
think
one
is,
well
two.
no
question
she
has
a
degree
from
--
mr.
george
tiernan
oh!
she
--
mr.
george
tiernan
i
didn’t
say
she
--
it’s
obvious,
she
understood
the
rules
because
she
so
admitted
in
the
transcript.
she
was
asked
if
she
was
aware
of
the
rules.
she
said
yes
and
she
signed
the
affidavit
of
the
application.
she
indicates
--
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
in
the
first
place
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
stated
really
three
things.
the
court
stated
that
first
a
lawyer
in
connecticut
has
generally
stated
is
an
officer
of
the
court.
secondly,
that
in
connecticut
in
addition
to
that,
the
attorney
is
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court.
and
in
that
connection,
the
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
in
connecticut
has
the
right
to
sign
civil
suits
and
command
executive
officers
to
serve
those
documents
in
the
state
and
--
mr.
george
tiernan
yes
he
can
sir
but
he
can
you
can
sign
that
issue.
any
member
of
the
bar
as
the
commissioner’s
brief
automatically
becomes
the
superior
court.(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
tiernan
i
--
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
of
course,
as
long
as
he
retains
--
as
long
as
he
retains
his
position
in
connecticut.
mr.
george
tiernan
whether
they
are
known
by
the
authorities
or
not
and
in
whatever
connection,
he
is
of
course
clothed
with
the
rights
of
the
office
that
he
has.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
of
course
that
would
be
obviously
a
question
--
mr.
george
tiernan
well
there’s
no
rule
here
that
says
that
if
you
can
be
a
citizen
of
two
countries
and
still
be
a
lawyer
and
of
course
--
mr.
george
tiernan
if
he
gives
up
his
citizenship?
mr.
george
tiernan
oh!
no
there’s
no
such
provision.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
by
what
test
or
standard
do
you
mean?
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
there
is
no
a
specific
provision
that
covers
any
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
i
assume
that
that
could
be
considered
without
any
specific
reference
thereto.
just
the
--
then
you
get
into
the
international
question
or
the
federal
question
of
citizen
--
may
i
just
call
attention
to
this
court,
to
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
question
raised
at
the
committee
hearings
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
treaty
existing
between
the
netherlands
and
the
united
states.
and
the
applicant
said
that
there
was
no
treaty
concerning
reciprocal
rights
of
either
national
to
practice
in
the
state
or
country
of
the
other.
but
actually
at
that
very
time,
there
was
a
treaty
between
–
and
is
a
treaty
between
the
netherlands
and
the
united
states
which
in
declaring
the
national
treatment
of
the
nationals
of
either
country,
specifically
excluded
by
by
the
protocol
of
that
treaty,
the
professions.
mr.
george
tiernan
it
was
after
1956.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes,
that’s
what’s
listed
in
the
original
court
decision
of
the
supreme
court
as
a
reference
of
the
appendix.
mr.
george
tiernan
there
is
to
the
statute
so
--
still
there.
did
you
include
barber
sir?
mr.
george
tiernan
that
is
becoming
moot
in
connecticut,
but
that
is
a
fact
that
those
statutes
are
still
there.
mr.
george
tiernan
you
see
i
come
from
new
haven,
justice
white
and
the
demand
is,
bless
me.[laughter]
the
--
now,
with
reference
to
the
(inaudible)
the
question
of
dual
citizenship
of
course
raises
a
problem.
this
has
been
reiterated
in
the
courts
of
this
--
in
this
court
--
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
it’s
impossible
in
the
case
of
lawyers
to
imagine
that
a
person
with
dual
nationality,
dual
citizenship,
dual
allegiance,
would
be
able
to
fulfill
the
task
that
that
person
has
in
reference
to
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
it
isn’t
because
of
course
this
applicant
wants
it
this
way,
being
a
citizen
of
the
netherlands
--
mr.
george
tiernan
no.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
she’s
getting
around
that.
she’s
going
to
have
both
options.
she’s
going
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
netherlands,
a
country
of
origin
and
the
right
to
practice
law
in
connecticut
and
if
that’s
isn't
having
it
both
ways,
i
can
imagine
what
is.
the
fact
is
that
also
referred
to
here
in
this
situation
is
the
case
of
schware,
the
case
to
which
--
it’s
about
the
only
case
that
set
down
to
test
of
what
is
necessary
for
the
admission
standards
reasonableness
was
required
and
its
felt
that
here
that
the
rule
in
connecticut
is
reasonable
and
rational
with
reference
to
the
admission
of
any
candidate
for
the
bar
of
connecticut.
mr.
george
tiernan
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
members
of
this
court.
the
issue
really
revolves
about
this
point,
that
the
applicant
here
is
seeking
admission
to
take
the
bar
examination
in
connecticut,
hopefully
with
the
final
expectation
of
admission
to
the
bar.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes.
that
she’s
seeking
admission
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
connecticut
on
her
own
terms
to
some
degree
at
least.
when
she
was
examined
before
the
committee,
one
of
the
committees
which
of
course
acts
as
an
agency
for
the
judicial
department
of
the
state,
the
court
to
the
state
in
the
procedure
for
bar
admission
which
of
course
appears
in
the
appendix,
she
was
inquired
of
as
to
her
residence
and
so
forth
beginning
at
page
30.
this
is
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
committee
on
recommendations.
now,
when
the
question
arrived
as
to
her
citizenship,
she
unequivocally
stated
that
she
was
not
and
that
she
had
no
plans
of
becoming
one.
the
inquiry
and
the
interrogations
stopped
at
that
point
by
the
committee.
the
first
question
posed
here
by
the
bench
satisfies
me
that
that
is
a
natural
inquiry
and
to
my
view,
the
first
inquiry.
why
didn’t
someone
ask
why?
now,
of
course,
the
first
and
basic
requirement
of
the
connecticut
rules,
which
has
been
an
effect
for
about
a
century,
is
first,
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
just
prior
to
that,
there
is
a
statement
to
entitle
an
applicant
to
admission
to
the
bar
except
in
section
12.
one
might
very
well
say,
well
what’s
that
exception
is
about.
the
exception
12
merely
refers
to
the
admission
on
motion
from
other
states
by
attorneys
in
the
state
of
this
country.
mr.
george
tiernan
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
mr.
george
tiernan
no,
the
citizen
of
the
united
states,
of
course,
in
order
to
become
a
citizen,
when
you
become
a
citizen
in
the
united
states
of
course,
you
become
a
citizen
of
a
state
that
you
are
presently
where
you
are.
there
is
no
specific
answer.
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
also
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
all
to
allegiance
to
both,
united
states
v.
lanza,
260
u.s
377.
the
case
decided
here
in
1922.
mr.
george
tiernan
no.
mr.
george
tiernan
the
only
requirement
is
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
then
the
second
question
which
was
--
mr.
george
tiernan
that
is
right
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
correct.
that
he
is
a
resident
of
this
state,
or
intends
to
become
such
resident.
now,
of
course,
that
question
was
really
not
followed
at
all
or
inquiry
following
the
unqualified
statement
by
this
applicant
before
a
said
committee
that
she
had
no
intention
of
becoming
a
citizen.
that
was
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
tiernan
well
of
course
the
rule
doesn’t
limit
it
just
to
--
it
says
there,
were
entitled
and
that
applicant
to
the
admission
to
the
bar
and
of
course
only
one
of
the
steps
is
the
citizenship.
now,
the
question
of
whether
a
person
says
i
filed
a
declaration.
mr.
george
tiernan
that
has
not
been
decided,
but
i
presume
that
he
would
not
until
he
evidenced
by
some
direct
manifestations
such
as
filing
a
declaration.
mr.
george
tiernan
that
i
could
not
answer
under
the
specific
rule
but
i
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
tiernan
as
to
residence
of
course,
yes
that’s
right.
one
comprehends
the
other.
mr.
george
tiernan
and
i
have
no
doubt.
mr.
george
tiernan
he
is
admitted
to
what,
to
the
bar
or
to
the
examination?
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
he
couldn’t
be
admitted
to
the
bar
--
mr.
george
tiernan
until
he
is
qualified
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes
sir.
mr.
george
tiernan
on
a
declaration
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
tiernan
no.
mr.
george
tiernan
that’s
a
very
--
that’s
the
vital
question.
that’s
the
vital
question.
may
i
just
introduce.
mr.
george
tiernan
thank
you
very
much.
the
one
thing
occurs
to
me
is
the
fact
of
this
court
does
not
have
any
machinery
for
admission
to
the
bar.
presumably,
that
through
the
history
of
this
court
is
because
they
--
mr.
george
tiernan
i
have
been
accustomed
to
being
heard
on
the
past.
mr.
george
tiernan
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
this
court
derives
its
qualifications
to
right
degree
of
practicing
before
this
court
by
state’s
attendance
presumably
because
they
believe
through
the
past
that
they
are
proficient
enough
to
be
accepted.
and
of
course
the
federal
system
has
no
separate
or
distinct
machinery
for
admitting
people
to
practice
before
us.
now,
one
of
the
basic
rules
of
admission
in
this
court
is
that
the
applicant
for
a
practice
before
this
court
as
today
must
represent
that
they
practiced
in
a
state
of
this
country
for
a
period
of
three
years.
it
would
be
difficult
to
understand
how
a
person
could
make
a
solid
showing
for
a
permission
to
practice
here
on
that
requirement.
because
of
course,
up
until
this
year,
there
was
no
single
state
that
unequivocally
by
decision
decided
or
found
that
citizenship
was
not
required
for
admission
to
the
bar.
now,
in
reference
to
graham
--
mr.
george
tiernan
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes.
yes,
there
are
couple.
mr.
george
tiernan
no
because
under
the
section
13
at
the
rules,
subparagraph
3,
one
of
the
kinds
in
addition
to
his
practice
in
the
other
state
is
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
that
is
common
to
both
non-resident
bar,
those
applying
to
motion
and
those
applying
directly.
mr.
george
tiernan
three
years?
mr.
george
tiernan
of
course,
i
take
it
that
this
issue
is
not
similar
to
the
issues
raise
or
the
factual
situation
raised
in
graham
and
dunn
versus
blumstein
voting
rights.
social
benefits
in
graham
--
because
of
course
in
those
cases,
we
have
a
situation
where
with
reference
to
graham
which
advanced
that
compelling
interest,
state
interest
test
to
be
applied
in
alienage
classifications.
right
there,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
case
distinguished
in
the
situation
there
because
of
course
the
financial
integrity
of
a
state
was
involved
just
as
in
shapiro,
nothing
about
anything
else.
that
was
a
case
where
they
were
trying
to
deprive
the
people
of
visiting
the
state
of
welfare
benefits
undergrounds
of
no
durational
residence
for
citizenship.
and
they
said
that
the
state
had
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest.
that
is
hardly
to
be
i
think
compared
with
admission
to
the
bar
because
of
course
the
reference
that
was
made
to
the
brief
concerning
the
special
judicial
scrutiny
required.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
mere
situation
in
graham
and
the
voting
case
in
graham
and
shapiro,
the
right
to
travel
which
although
doesn’t
appear
specifically
in
the
constitution
has
been
inserted
therein
by
judicial
decision,
and
the
fundamental
right
of
travel
of
people
in
this
country
was
restricted,
says
this
court
in
those
cases.
but
in
the
graham
case,
there
was
a
discussion
concerning
one
of
the
tests
used
in
our
history
of
special
interest
and
in
that
very
case,
graham
on
page
374,
403,
this
court
stated
that
although
the
special
interest
test
was
rejected,
so
far
as
the
social
benefits
were
concerned,
social
benefit
cases
which
of
course
graham
represented,
this
court
specifically
said,
whatever
maybe
the
contemporary
vitality
of
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
and
other
context
at
the
takahashi,
we
conclude
so
forth.
in
other
words,
they
left
open,
this
very
court
left
open
even
the
application
of
a
special
interest
test.
now,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
referred
to
the
--
talked
about
truax
which
of
course
is
the
case
that
obviously
when
this
country
grants
entrance
and
vote
to
an
alien,
obviously,
one
follows
the
other.
the
early
efforts
of
course,
when
this
question
was
raised
from
--
in
this
country
from
a
country
that
once
had
many
aliens,
when
we’re
in
the
formative
stages,
when
that
question
was
raised
here
in
the
--
as
in
to
the
truax
case,
the
court
said
it
was
limited
to
the
right
of
an
alien
to
indulge
in
the
common
occupations
of
men
or
sometimes
it
was
a
common
i
believe
industrial
occupations.
that
has
always
been
interpreted
even
by
writers,
scholarly
writers,
law
writers,
that
that
did
not
include
professions.
now,
incidentally
in
this
connection,
efforts
have
been
made
to
add.
mr.
george
tiernan
the
columbia
law
review,
57
columbia
law
review
10
(12)
at
page
10
(26)
in
1957,
the
title
of
which
is
“the
constitutionality
of
the
restrictions
on
aliens’
rights
to
work.”
mr.
george
tiernan
i
didn’t
have
the
name.
mr.
george
tiernan
that
is
correct
and
that
is
why
i
didn’t
give
you
any
name.
mr.
george
tiernan
no,
it
isn’t.
it’s
a
comment,
i
think.
mr.
george
tiernan
i
don't
know
--
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
there
were
others.
that
was
just
--
mr.
george
tiernan
yes.
but
of
course,
how
can
this
be
considered
as
all
inclusive
and
have
any
meaning
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
how
can
this
be
considered
as
being
all
inclusive
for
all
forms
of
occupational
activity
including
the
professions
when
it's
indicated
classifications
are
permissible
that
must
be
justified.
after
all
even
bar
admission
rules
must
be
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution,
but
how
can
we
ever
permit
any
classifications
as
such
so
far
as
employment
is
concerned,
if
that
is
so?
now,
--
mr.
george
tiernan
i
hope
not.
mr.
george
tiernan
i
don’t
know.
mr.
george
tiernan
why
as
the
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
history
reports
that
when
connecticut
was
saying
no
to
aliens,
they
were
saying
yes
to
women.
now,
i
don’t
know
whether
that
would
be
called
and
that
was
sometime
ago.
mr.
george
tiernan
because
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
court
has
established
by
this
court,
presented,
i
should
say,
by
its
decision
that
because
of
the
status
and
the
position
of
the
lawyer
in
the
state,
there
are
other
conditions
or
qualifications
that
are
required,
citizenship,
residency,
educational
requirements,
they
say,
this
court
stated
that
in
order
to
have
a
system
toward
the
administration
of
justice
and
in
the
public
interest
in
connecticut,
a
lawyer
who
is
called
with
the
right
to
command
actions
by
authority
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
in
connection
with
his
affairs
both
private,
both
public,
and
his
reference
to
individuals
as
a
counselor.
mr.
george
tiernan
no.
mr.
george
tiernan
no,
i
didn’t
say
that.
mr.
george
tiernan
what
you’re
trying
to
say
is
that
alienage
is
an
irrational
classification
per
se.
this
court
has
not
said
so
but
you
have
to
have
the
opportunity
to
say
it
right
now.
mr.
george
tiernan
i’m
backing
up
to
the
court.
in
this
case
in
which
i
represent.
in
connecticut,
the
court
stated
that
because
of
the
position
that
member
of
the
bar
holds
that
citizenship
is
a
requirement,
that
there
is
nothing
irrational
above
the
state
asking
for
that
in
accordance
with
the
precepts
set
down
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
in
the
first
place,
as
one
said
in
--
just
examine
the
duties
of
a
lawyer,
his
relationship
both
to
the
individual,
the
public,
his
connection
with
the
court,
his
involvement
of
the
rules,
his
involvement
of
the
procedure,
and
the
changing
procedure
and
changing
rules,
all
of
this
is
connected
with
the
government.
mr.
george
tiernan
and
there
are
three
degrees.
i
think
one
is,
well
two.
no
question
she
has
a
degree
from
--
mr.
george
tiernan
oh!
she
--
mr.
george
tiernan
i
didn’t
say
she
--
it’s
obvious,
she
understood
the
rules
because
she
so
admitted
in
the
transcript.
she
was
asked
if
she
was
aware
of
the
rules.
she
said
yes
and
she
signed
the
affidavit
of
the
application.
she
indicates
--
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
in
the
first
place
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
stated
really
three
things.
the
court
stated
that
first
a
lawyer
in
connecticut
has
generally
stated
is
an
officer
of
the
court.
secondly,
that
in
connecticut
in
addition
to
that,
the
attorney
is
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court.
and
in
that
connection,
the
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
in
connecticut
has
the
right
to
sign
civil
suits
and
command
executive
officers
to
serve
those
documents
in
the
state
and
--
mr.
george
tiernan
yes
he
can
sir
but
he
can
you
can
sign
that
issue.
any
member
of
the
bar
as
the
commissioner’s
brief
automatically
becomes
the
superior
court.(voice

mr.
george
tiernan
i
--
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
of
course,
as
long
as
he
retains
--
as
long
as
he
retains
his
position
in
connecticut.
mr.
george
tiernan
whether
they
are
known
by
the
authorities
or
not
and
in
whatever
connection,
he
is
of
course
clothed
with
the
rights
of
the
office
that
he
has.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
of
course
that
would
be
obviously
a
question
--
mr.
george
tiernan
well
there’s
no
rule
here
that
says
that
if
you
can
be
a
citizen
of
two
countries
and
still
be
a
lawyer
and
of
course
--
mr.
george
tiernan
if
he
gives
up
his
citizenship?
mr.
george
tiernan
oh!
no
there’s
no
such
provision.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
by
what
test
or
standard
do
you
mean?
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
there
is
no
a
specific
provision
that
covers
any
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
i
assume
that
that
could
be
considered
without
any
specific
reference
thereto.
just
the
--
then
you
get
into
the
international
question
or
the
federal
question
of
citizen
--
may
i
just
call
attention
to
this
court,
to
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
question
raised
at
the
committee
hearings
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
treaty
existing
between
the
netherlands
and
the
united
states.
and
the
applicant
said
that
there
was
no
treaty
concerning
reciprocal
rights
of
either
national
to
practice
in
the
state
or
country
of
the
other.
but
actually
at
that
very
time,
there
was
a
treaty
between
–
and
is
a
treaty
between
the
netherlands
and
the
united
states
which
in
declaring
the
national
treatment
of
the
nationals
of
either
country,
specifically
excluded
by
by
the
protocol
of
that
treaty,
the
professions.
mr.
george
tiernan
it
was
after
1956.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes.
mr.
george
tiernan
yes,
that’s
what’s
listed
in
the
original
court
decision
of
the
supreme
court
as
a
reference
of
the
appendix.
mr.
george
tiernan
there
is
to
the
statute
so
--
still
there.
did
you
include
barber
sir?
mr.
george
tiernan
that
is
becoming
moot
in
connecticut,
but
that
is
a
fact
that
those
statutes
are
still
there.
mr.
george
tiernan
you
see
i
come
from
new
haven,
justice
white
and
the
demand
is,
bless
me.[laughter]
the
--
now,
with
reference
to
the
(inaudible)
the
question
of
dual
citizenship
of
course
raises
a
problem.
this
has
been
reiterated
in
the
courts
of
this
--
in
this
court
--
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
it’s
impossible
in
the
case
of
lawyers
to
imagine
that
a
person
with
dual
nationality,
dual
citizenship,
dual
allegiance,
would
be
able
to
fulfill
the
task
that
that
person
has
in
reference
to
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
it
isn’t
because
of
course
this
applicant
wants
it
this
way,
being
a
citizen
of
the
netherlands
--
mr.
george
tiernan
no.
mr.
george
tiernan
well,
she’s
getting
around
that.
she’s
going
to
have
both
options.
she’s
going
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
netherlands,
a
country
of
origin
and
the
right
to
practice
law
in
connecticut
and
if
that’s
isn't
having
it
both
ways,
i
can
imagine
what
is.
the
fact
is
that
also
referred
to
here
in
this
situation
is
the
case
of
schware,
the
case
to
which
--
it’s
about
the
only
case
that
set
down
to
test
of
what
is
necessary
for
the
admission
standards
reasonableness
was
required
and
its
felt
that
here
that
the
rule
in
connecticut
is
reasonable
and
rational
with
reference
to
the
admission
of
any
candidate
for
the
bar
of
connecticut.
