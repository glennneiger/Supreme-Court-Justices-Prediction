and
there
is
no
implementation
plan
here,
is
it
that
had
been
issued?
unknown
speaker
that
means
he
hasn’t
issued
it?
unknown

the
reason
i
asked
because
down
below
your
office
or
the
department
of
justice
took
the
position
that
this
was
all
premature
because
no
plan
had
been
promulgated.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
implementation
plan
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
and
if
so
stipulated?
unknown
speaker
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you
that
it
was
a
final
judgment,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
so
when
did
the
investigation
--
when
did
it
change
its
mind?
unknown
speaker
would
they
set
up
new
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well
they
promulgated
the
initial
requirements
as
to
another
(inaudible)?
unknown

isn’t
that
what
you

somebody

asked
mr.

where
he
found
that
prohibitions
that
--
unknown

i
know
but
where
did
he
--
there
was
not
anything
else
you
would
have
said
mr.
benjamin
that
says
that
in
the
purpose
of
the
law.
now
where
is
the
provision
in
the
law
that
implements
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
now,
he
could
have
answered
it,
could
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
he
would
have
said
there
is
no
other
provision.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
so
he
would
have
said
that
there
is
no
other
significant
--
unknown
speaker
does
the
administrator
ever
apply
the
act
or
interpret
the

differently
than
he
does
now
or?

he
did
not
