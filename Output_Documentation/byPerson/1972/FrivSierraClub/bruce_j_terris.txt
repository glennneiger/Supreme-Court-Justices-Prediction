mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
you
turn
just
to
the
outset
to
this
question
about
the
preliminary
injunction.
if
you
look
at
pages
31
to
32
of
the
appendix,
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
31,
the
district
court
stated
having
considered
the
stated
purpose
of
the
clean
air
act
of
1970
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
its
predecessor
in
the
past
and
present
administrative
interpretation
of
the
acts.
it
is
our
judgment
that
the
clean
air
act
of
1970
is
based
on
important
part
on
a
policy
of
non-degradation
of
existing
clear
air
and
that
40
cfr
51.12(b)
in
permitting
the
states
to
submit
plans,
which
allow
pollution
levels
of
clean
air
to
rise
to
the
secondary
standard
of
pollution.
it
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
policy
of
the
act
and
is
therefore
invalid.
now
admittedly
the
court
then
went
on
in
the
next
section
under
injunctive
relief
to
say
there
was
likelihood
of
success
but
in
fact
what
the
parties
did
is
interpret
that
sentence
that
i
have
just
read
to
you
as
an
effect
to
final
conclusion
that
that
regulation
was
invalid.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
we
so
stipulated.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
correct
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
its
order
of
course
has
been
pointed
out
it
didn’t
(inaudible)
any
other
matters.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
end
effect
by
that
point
at
least
and
interpreted
as
the
stipulation
indicates
to
be
a
final
judgment.
so
probably
the
only
thing
we
do
agree
with
the
government
in
the
case
is
that
this,
we
think
of
final
judgment,
which
is
before
the
court
and
should
be
treated
as
such.
this
case
your
honors
involves
the
air
quality
of
most
of
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
well
it
talked
about
both.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
both
said
the
regulation
was
invalid
and
said
there
was
a
probability
of
success.
i
would
read
that
to
say
that
since
the
regulation
was
invalid
indeed
there
was
probability
of
success.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honors,
this
case
involves
the
air
quality
of
most
of
the
united
states.
it
involves
any
area
where
air
quality
is
better
than
one
or
more
of
the
secondary
standards
for
the
six
pollutants
and
therefore
this
case
will
vitally
effect
all
rural
areas,
suburban
areas
and
even
a
great
many
urban
areas.
petitioner
adopted
a
regulation,
which
would
allow
all
these
areas,
the
air
in
them
to
deteriorate
to
the
secondary
standards.
we
believe
that
the
result
will
be
massive
deterioration
of
air
quality
both
measured
by
the
area
affected
and
by
the
total
pollution
emitted
into
the
air.
while
the
pollution
in
cities
will
be
lowered
under
the
statute
to
the
secondary
standards
over
the
next
few
years
and
many
particularly
clean
areas
pollution
will
increase
five,
ten,
or
even
more
times.
since
there
will
be
an
increase
in
pollution
in
far
more
areas
than
it
will
be
reduced,
a
vast
increase
in
pollution
will
result.
now
this
is
no
mere
theoretical
possibility.
pollution
has
increased
drastically
in
the
formerly
almost
pure
air
of
the
southwest,
as
coal-burning
power
plants
have
been
located
there
over
the
last
few
years.
any
air
traveler
can
see
the
haze
hanging
over
that
area.
epa
itself
has
found
that
even
the
grand
canyon
is
threatened
with
air
pollution.
plants
from
montana
and
wyoming
are
even
more
threatening.
proposed
coal-burning
power
plants
there
would
emit
five
to
ten
times
the
air
pollution
of
new
york
city
and
los
angeles
combined.
we
submit
that
these
are
only
the
most
dramatic
examples
of
what
will
occur
if
the
unanimous
decisions
of
the
courts
below
are
reversed
and
petitioner’s
regulation
is
approved.
an
even
blanket
of
air
pollution
will
spread
across
the
country.
the
pollution
level
will
be
approximately
the
same
from
coast
to
coast
as
it
now
is
for
example
as
to
sulfur
oxides
in
particulates
in
boston,
detroit,
and
pittsburg.
in
protest
against
this
massive
deterioration
air
quality,
20
states
have
filed
briefs
as
amici
in
support
of
respondents
in
this
court
to
challenge
petitioner’s
policy.
respondents
submit
the
petitioner’s
regulation
is
invalid
because
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
language
of
the
clean
air
act
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
theoretically,
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
as
a
practical
matter
what
happens
is
that
there
would
be
competition
among
states
for
having
the
lowest
air
pollution
standard.
let
me
give
an
explicit
example.
arizona
supports
the
government
in
this
case.
new
mexico
supports
respondents.
both
of
them
are
now
threatened
with
coal-burning
power
plants
that
will
add
drastically
to
air
pollution.
if
new
mexico
imposes,
a
very
strict
standard
then
those
power
plants
will
be
built
in
arizona
but
new
mexico
will
get
the
dirty
air
from
arizona
and
so
the
net
result
to
new
mexico
will
be
that
they
will
still
get
their
air
pollution
but
they
will
not
get
the
economic
benefits
of
the
power
plants.
now
what
these
states
are
arguing
is
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
national
requirement
as
they
believe
the
law
provides
that
there
would
be
no
significant
deterioration
of
clean
air
then
the
rule
they
will
be
the
same
nationally,
then
industry
will
not
locate
it
one
street
versus
another
because
of
the
low
air
pollution
standard
that
industry
will
then
use
all
of
its
funds
and
resources
to
develop
methods
for
not
significantly
deteriorating
the
air
and
still
being
able
to
do
the
things,
which
the
country
needs
to
have
done.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
did
--
it’s
an
exact
--
we
think
in
exact
parallel,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right
and
that
of
course
is
what
president
nixon
said
in
proposing
the
1970
statute
and
we
have
cited
a
number
of
studies
in
our
brief
which
shows
that
air
pollution
moves
long
distances
across
state
lines
that
there
was
a
serious
air
pollution
problem
in
miami
which
came
from
the
northeast
that
there
have
been
serious
air
pollution
problems
in
oklahoma
which
came
from
the
great
lake
states.
there
is
no
way
for
a
state
to
protect
its
air
by
prohibiting
significant
deterioration
unless
the
other
states
that
are
nearby
also
do
the
same.
now,
we
submit
that
the
statute
itself
is
clear.
the
congress
called
the
1970
amendments
the
clean
air
act
and
that
that
act
states
as
the
first
of
its
purposes
that
it
was
designed
to
protect
and
enhance
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
air
resources.
we
submit
the
petitioner’s
regulation
cannot
produce
clean
air
and
will
not
enhance
or
even
maintain
existing
air
property
and
we
believe
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statutes.
but
whether
or
not
the
statutory
language
itself
is
clear
enough,
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
is
overwhelming.
it
is
interesting
that
the
government
in
oral
argument
here
has
not
eluded
it
all
to
this
legislative
history.
in
fact,
they
have
not
in
either
of
their
two
briefs
alluded
to
some
of
the
most
important
elements
of
it.
let
me
just
briefly
state
what
those
are.
first
in
1967,
the
protect
and
enhance
language
was
first
put
into
the
act.
the
senate
report
said
that
this
language
was
designed
to
enhance
air
quality
and
to
reduce
harmful
emissions
anywhere
in
the
country
not
just
in
areas
of
high
pollution.
the
history
of
the
1970
act
which
section
--
which
left
section
1857
unchanged
is
even
more
clear.
john
benjamin,
then
the
undersecretary
of
the
hew
which
enforced
the
air
pollution
law
at
that
time
read
a
statement
on
behalf
of
secretary
finch
and
the
administration
to
both
the
senate
and
house
committees
considering
the
1970
act.
and
this
statement
is
on
pages
27
to
28
of
our
red
brief.
it
says,
“one
of
the
expressed
purposes
of
the
clean
air
act
is
to
protect
and
enhance
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
air
resources.
accordingly,
it
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
our
view
that
implementation
plans
that
would
permit
significant
deterioration
of
air
quality
in
any
area
would
be
in
conflict
with
this
provision
of
the
act.”
we
submit
that’s
our
case.
that
those
two
sentences
are
an
all
force
with
our
contention.
that
that
language
prohibits
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it’s
on
pages
27
to
28.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
first
sentence
of
that
--
oh,
i
did
your
honor
that
that
is
to
protect
and
enhance
language.
now,
the
first
sentence
of
what
i
just
read
to
you,
your
honor
was
the
statute.
what
--
let
me
go
back,
the
first
sentence
of
what
secretary
benjamin
said
was
one
of
the
expressed
purposes
of
the
clean
air
act
is,
and
then
he
starts
to
quote
the
statute,
“to
protect
and
enhance
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
air
resources,”
that’s
the
end
of
his
quote
of
the
statute.
then
he
says,
“accordingly
based
on
that
provision
of
the
statute
it
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
our
view
that
implementation
plans
they
would
permit
significant
deterioration
of
air
quality
in
any
area
would
be
in
conflict
with
this
provision
of
the
act.”
so
what
he
is
saying
is,
that
provision
of
the
statute
prohibits
significant
deterioration
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
he
is
not
your
honor.
now,
i
will
get
on
to
what
congress
response
was.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
at
least
in
the
sense.
first
of
all,
we
think
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
indicates
that
a
massive
deterioration
of
air
quality
was
not
intended
by
congress,
that
that
is
not
consistent
with
protecting
and
enhance
air
quality.
second
to
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
administration
coming
up,
the
people
that
enforce
this
statute
coming
up
and
telling
congress
that
a
provision
of
the
statute
prohibits
significant
deterioration.
congress
passes
sweeping
amendments
in
1970
to
strengthen
the
act.
it
leaves
that
provision
unchanged.
now,
we
submit
that
when
the
enforcers
of
the
statute
come
to
congress
and
say,
“this
is
what
this
provision
means,”
and
congress
although
modifying
almost
the
whole
rest
of
the
act
does
not
touch
that
section
that
that
is
at
least
persuasive.
now,
i
will
get
on
to
what
the
congress
though
itself
said,
because
i
think
that’s
important.
now,
secretary
benjamin
also
repeated
that
statement
in
effect
in
his
own
words.
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
committee
which
was
considering
the
1970
legislation,
our
witness
representing
the
chemical
industry
protested
that
the
bill
before
congress
would
constitute
an
unqualified
edict
against
any
or
every
degradation
because
the
standards
would
apply
to
all
area
regions
that
are
now
were
recreational
or
otherwise
unindustrialized.
he
therefore
proposed
a
flexible
provision
for
balancing
the
equities
as
to
each
area
in
place
of
the
national
prohibition
against
significant
deterioration.
congressman
rogers
who
was
on
the
committee,
a
ranking
member
of
the
committee
responded
by
vigorously
opposing
this
proposal
because
it
would
allow
clean
air
areas
to
be
polluted,
so
that
the
country
would
be
faced
with
having
to
clean
them
up
later.
mr.
rogers’
statement
is
on
page
31
of
our
brief.
the
committee
left
intact
section
1857
which
prohibited
deterioration
according
to
the
administration
witnesses.
in
addition,
the
house
report,
we
think
clearly
adopted
congressman
roger’s
position
because
it
said
that
significant
--
that
it
effectively
said
that
significant
deterioration
was
prohibited
by
stating
the
following,
“the
war
against
the
air
pollution
will
be
carried
out
throughout
the
nation
rather
than
only
on
particular
geographical
areas.”
and
then
he
went
on
to
say,
“effective
pollution
control
requires
both
reduction
of
present
pollution
and
prevention
of
new
significant
pollution
problems.
that’s
almost
identical
what
congressman
rogers
had
said
in
response
to
the
witness.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
senate
report
which
underlies
the
1970
act.
first
it
said
that
the
statute
applied
nationally
and
did
not
apply
just
uniquely
critical
areas.
it
then
made
clear
that
no
state
plan
permitting
significant
deterioration
of
air
quality
should
be
approved
by
saying
first
deterioration
of
air
quality
should
not
be
permitted
except
under
circumstances
where
there
is
no
available
alternative.
now,
if
they
stop
there
obviously
what
congress
would
have
meant
would
have
been
that
in
some
instances
at
least,
significant
deterioration
could
be
allowed.
but
then
the
committee
went
on
to
say
that
alternatives
existed,
it
listed
the
alternatives
and
said
deterioration
need
not
occur.
and
that’s
on
page
32
of
our
brief.
now,
the
language
upon
which
the
statement
was
based
section
1857
was
in
the
1967
act
and
was
not
changed
by
the
1970
statute.
petitioner
claims
that
the
senate
bill
was
later
changed
before
its
adoption.
the
only
subsequent
changes
in
the
bill
after
the
senate
report
and
this
is
basically
a
senate
bill
were
to
tighten
the
provisions
designed
to
reduce
pollution
in
dirty
air
areas,
in
other
words
in
the
cities.
the
tightening
of
controls
as
to
dirty
air
areas
obviously
cannot
lead
to
any
inference.
the
congress
intended
to
weaken
the
bill’s
provisions
as
to
clean
air
areas.
now,
petitioner
in
its
reply
brief
quotes
at
considerable
length
summaries
of
the
1970
act
and
says
that
if
this
very
important
provision
were
intended
by
congress
to
apply
to
across
the
county,
why
was
it
not
in
this
congressional
summaries
of
the
act?
there
is
a
simple
answer
to
this
contention
and
that
is
section
1857
was
not
in
the
1970
act.
it
was
in
the
1967
act.
the
1970
statute
contained
only
amendments
to
the
1967
statute
and
since
congress
after
being
informed
that
section
1857
prohibited
significant
deterioration
decided
to
retain
this
provision
without
amendment,
it
was
not
in
the
1970
act.
therefore
it
is
natural
that
the
summaries
of
the
1970
act
did
not
include
a
summary
of
a
provision
which
was
not
in
the
statute.
we
submit
that
the
--
not
only
as
the
legislative
history
strongly
support
of
our
position
but
the
contemporaneous
and
consistent
administrative
interpretation
until
1971
was
likewise
the
section
1857
prohibited
significant
deterioration.
counsel
has
said
that
epa
has
long
said
that
implementation
plans
could
not
prohibit
that
there
was
no
requirement
that
implementation
plans
had
to
prohibit
significant
deterioration.
that
long
standing
rule
goes
back
to
august
1971.
in
1969,
the
national
air
pollution
control
administrations
which
then
enforce
the
statute
gave
the
states
guidelines
for
its
implementation
plans.
under
the
heading
of
requirements
of
the
air
quality
act,
the
states
were
told
and
this
on
page
26
of
our
brief,
an
explicit
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
protect
and
enhance
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
air
resources.
again,
they
were
quoting
section
1857
from
the
statute.
air
quality
standards
which
even
if
fully
implemented
would
result
in
significant
deterioration
of
air
quality
and
any
substantial
portions
of
an
air
quality
region
clearly
would
conflict
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
the
law.
so
what
hew
told
the
states
in
1969
was
this
identical
language
prohibited
significant
deterioration
then
secretaries
finch
and
benjamin
told
the
congress,
both
houses
of
congress
the
same
thing
in
1970
as
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
their
interpretation
of
the
1970
administration
bill.
two
other
hew
officials,
high
officials
told
congressional
committees
the
same
thing
in
1969
and
1970.
and
in
1971,
petitioner
promulgated
his
own
national
primary
and
secondary
standards
which
we
think
plainly
stated,
the
standard
shall
not
be
considered
in
any
manner
to
allow
significant
deterioration
of
existing
air
quality
in
any
portion
of
any
state.
we
submit
those
regulations
despite
the
rather
elaborate
attempt
to
explain
a
way
that
language
is
directly
inconsistent
with
the
regulation
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
now
petitioner,
principally
relies
on
section
110
of
the
act
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
august
1971.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
they
didn’t
replace.
we
have
at
the
moment,
we
have
two
inconsistent
regulations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right
your
honor.
what
we
have
now
are
two
documents
in
effect.
we
have
the
national
primary
and
secondary
air
quality
standards
which
we
believe
clearly
prohibits
significant
deterioration
and
then
we
have
requirements
for
preparation
adoption
and
submittal
of
the
implementation
plans
which
has
the
language
which
we
challenged
which
permits
significant
deterioration.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right.
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
don’t
rely
on
it
because
we
think
the
statute
in
its
legislative
history
make
the
regulation
invalid.
we
rely
on
that
for
the
proposition
that
the
administrator
continued
even
into
1971
to
believe
that
the
statute
prohibited
significant
deterioration.
even
if
we
were
wrong,
i
am
at
interpretation
and
the
government’s
we
think
rather
strained
interpretation
of
that
regulation
is
correct.
we
still
believe
that
the
statute
in
this
legislative
history
and
earlier
administrative
interpretation
are
conclusive.
we
note
particularly,
your
honors,
that
of
course
when
one
is
looking
to
administrative
interpretation
to
get
the
greatest
way
to
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
the
contemporaneous
administrative
interpretation
which
is
most
persuasive.
and
that
of
course,
occurred
repeatedly
in
1969
and
1970.
as
i
indicated
before
we
think
the
harder,
what
the
government
is
arguing
is
that
section
110
is
conclusive
on
this
case
that
it
provides
the
only
criteria
from
which
the
administrator
can
reject
the
state
plan.
and
that
these
criteria
do
not
include
a
prohibition
on
significant
deterioration.
we
believe
that
this
contention
is
wrong
for
several
different
reasons.
first,
the
language
of
section
1857
specifically
states
that
it
implies
to
the
entire
statute
and
we
submit
that
means
it
applies
to
section
110
like
it
applies
to
everything
else
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
need
to
restate
the
prohibition
against
significant
deterioration
in
section
110
or
any
other
portion
of
the
act.
since
congress
had
been
repeatedly
told
at
least
on
four
different
occasions
that
section
1857
prohibited
significant
deterioration,
congress
obviously
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
add
another
provision
in
section
110
but
decided
to
simply
to
leave
section
1857
unchanged.
second,
section
110
allows
the
petitioner
as
petitioner
emphasizes
to
enforce
the
national
standards.
since
section
1857
applies
to
the
entire
act,
we
think
it
is
clear
the
congress
intended
the
prohibition
against
significant
deterioration
to
be
part
of
the
national
standards.
this
construction
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
statement
in
the
senate
report
that
state
implementation
plans
may
not
permit
significant
deterioration
is
part
of
the
report’s
discussion
of
the
national
standards.
and
if
there’s
doubt
about
this,
petitioner
himself
is
included
a
prohibition
against
significant
deterioration
in
the
national
standard
which
he
promulgated.
third,
section
110
or
language
comparable
to
it
was
contained
in
the
1967
statute,
the
1970
bills
considered
by
congress
and
the
1970
statute.
nevertheless,
both
high
federal
officials
and
congressional
committees
stated
repeatedly
that
section
1857
requires
state
implementation
plans
to
prevent
significant
deterioration.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right,
your
honor.
i
want
to
be
clear,
i
doubt
if
we
would
be
here
if
that
language
stood
all
by
itself
that
there
was
no
explanation
of
it
anywhere
but
what
we
have
is
the
repeated
statements
both
in
congress
and
by
high
administration
officials
charged
with
interpreting
that
statute
saying
that
that
language
explicitly
prohibited
significant
deterioration.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
that’s
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
however,
your
honor,
it’s
interesting
that
the
same
thing
occurred
under
the
earlier
water
pollution
laws
that
enforcers
there
interpreted
the
purpose
sections
to
prohibit
significant
deterioration.
it
seems
to
me
what’s
so
critical
about
this
is
that
congress
made
clear
that
it
wanted
to
prohibit
significant
deterioration.
the
administration
told
them
that
this
had
already
been
done.
they
now
come
back
after
congress
has
acted
in
1970
and
to
say,
well,
that
statute
that
we
told
you
prohibited
significant
deterioration
really
doesn’t
do
so.
it
means
in
effect
that
congress
when
it
was
considering
these
amendments
never
got
the
chance
to
put
into
the
statute
specific
language.
now,
we
believe
that
to
protect
an
enhance
language
is
at
the
very
least
strongly
indicative
of
our
position.
we
think
that
a
mass
of
deterioration
of
air
quality
in
this
country
cannot
possibly
be
consistent
with
the
statute
which
requires
that
the
air
quality
be
protected
and
enhanced.
when
i
said
that
we
would
not
be
here
on
that
language
alone,
what
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
language
is
the
--
no,
your
honor.
that
language
is
the
identical
language
which
was
relied
on
by
the
administration
repeatedly
in
1969
and
1970
and
was
relied
on
by
the
senate
report.
there
was
no
other
language.
no
language
was
ever
taken
out
of
the
statute
which
could
possibly
be
the
justification
for
earlier
statements
that
significant
deterioration
was
prohibited
and
therefore
one
could
argue
that
the
present
law
did
not
include
that
prohibition.
in
fact,
i
think
that
gets
to
a
critical
point.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
he
had
said
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
unless
what
mr.
benjamin
thought
and
the
administration
thought
on
repeated
statements
was
that
that
purpose
section
was
meant
to
have
operative
effect.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right.
he
would
have
said
this
section
prohibits
significant
deterioration.
he
didn’t
say
it.
that
is
exactly
the
language
i
quoted
to
you.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
exactly
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
that
would
be
possible
except
for
that
isn’t
what
was
said
to
congress.
what
congress
was
told
was
that
significant
deterioration
would
conflict
what
the
express
purpose
of
the
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
can
only
read
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
the
language
what
was
told
to
congress.
congress
was
told
that
significant
deterioration
would
conflict
with
the
law.
it
didn’t
say
that
congress
was
not
told
the
administrator
could
find
that
that
he
have
the
option
to
do
it.
it
was
said
that
the
law
itself
was
in
conflict
with
significant
deterioration.
i
submit
that
that
was
clear
as
one
can
be
the
question
was
not
raised
obviously
in
the
direct
form
that
your
honor
has
just
raised
it
with
me.
but
it
was
said
over
and
over
again
and
for
example
when
the
witness
before
the
house
committee
said,
“the
statute
was
an
unqualified
edict.”
congressman
rogers
says,
“that’s
right
and
we’re
going
to
keep
it
there.”
and
the
house
committee
did
keep
it
there.
and
the
house
committee
said
the
reason
we
are
keeping
it
there
is
because
we
want
to
prevent
new
pollution
problems
from
arising.
now
what
the
government
is
in
effect
saying
is
that
the
night
--
and
i
think
there
isn’t
much
doubt
about
this,
that
they
--
the
very
least
they
suggests
this
that
the
1967
statute
did
prohibit
significant
deterioration
but
now
it
does
not.
now,
that
is
in
effect
an
argument
that
was
has
happened
is
that
there
has
been
a
repeal
by
implication
because
the
language
is
identical.
it
was
not
changed
by
the
1970
act.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
would
think
that
would
be
considerable
less,
your
honor.
i
mean
this
was
a
statement
by
the
highest
administration
official
charge
with
enforcing
this
particular
statute.
and
i
think
under
the
well
recognize
principles
of
statutory
construction
that’s
entitled
to
very
considerable
weight.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i’m,
i’m
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
it
is
entitled
to
a
very
great
deal
of
weight
but
it
doesn’t
stand
alone
your
honor.
it
stands
with
mr.
johnson,
who
was
the
next
man
under
mr.
benjamin
on
this
subject
saying
the
same
thing
to
congress
in
1969.
dr.
middleton
said
the
same
thing
to
the
congress
in
1970.
the
official
guidelines
of
the
agency
which
enforce
the
statutes
said
the
same
thing
in
1969.
the
senate
reports
says
the
same
thing
in
1970.
i
think
i
can
answer
quite
whether
i
would
urge
to
your
honor
that
if
this
stood
all
by
itself
whether
this
would
be
sufficient
i
think
we
would
argue
that
it
is
sufficient
but
there
is
such
a
massive
legislative
history
here
and
administrative
history
that
there
is
no
need
to
look
at
one
isolated
sentence.
now
the
interesting
thing
is
really
the
government
doesn’t
have
any
substantial
answer
to
this.
what
the
reply
brief
says
and
i
guess
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
answer
to
most
of
this.
it’s
in
the
second
sentence.
at
the
most
this
legislative
history
indicates
that
some
individuals
testifying
on
the
bills
and
even
some
congressman
believe
in
the
policy
of
non-deterioration
would
be
advisable.
well,
that
seems
to
me
are
the
weak
way
of
describing
what
secretaries
finch
and
benjamin
were
saying,
they
came
to
the
hill
as
the
official
spokesman
of
the
people
that
enforce
statute.
we
have
senate
report.
we
have
a
house
report.
those
reports
don’t
say
it’s
advisable.
they
say
the
statute
requires
it.
that
any
allowance
of
significant
deterioration
would
be
inconsistent
would
be
in
conflict
with
this
provision
and
we
submit
that
that
ought
to
be
sufficient.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
which
applies
to
section
110.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
my
argument
is
two-fold,
and
they
are,
first
of
all,
1857
in
terms
applies
to
section
110
as
it
does
to
every
other
section
of
the
statute.
that’s
the
first
argument
on
the
proposition.
an
additional
argument
is
that
we
think
that
means
that
this
is
prohibition
on
significant
deterioration
is
part
of
the
national
standards.
in
fact
the
administrator
has
made
it
part
of
the
national
standards.
now,
if
you
look
through
the
list
of
the
reasons
one
can
turn
down
an
implementation
plan
in
section
110.
everybody
agrees
that
one
reason
for
turning
it
down
is
it
does
not
comply
with
the
national
standards.
these
made
it
a
part
of
the
national
standards;
we
think
he
had
to
because
section
1857
applies
to
the
entire
statute.
let
me
just
make
one
final
point
because
i
know
the
red
light
is
on
and
that
is
all
the
statements
that
i
have
talked
about
secretaries
finch
and
benjamin,
the
house
report,
the
senate
report,
the
other
legislative
administrative
history
all
apply
to
a
statute
which
either
had
the
identical
provision
as
section
110
or
was
--
had
a
provision
similar
to
section
110
in
the
sense
that
they
require
the
administrator
to
approve
implementation
plans
if
they
met
certain
criteria
which
did
not
include
explicitly
under
within
that
section,
section
110.
so
all
these
legislative
history,
administrative
history
goes
directly
to
this
point
of
what
section
110
means
in
conjunction
with
section
1857.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
you
turn
just
to
the
outset
to
this
question
about
the
preliminary
injunction.
if
you
look
at
pages
31
to
32
of
the
appendix,
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
31,
the
district
court
stated
having
considered
the
stated
purpose
of
the
clean
air
act
of
1970
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
its
predecessor
in
the
past
and
present
administrative
interpretation
of
the
acts.
it
is
our
judgment
that
the
clean
air
act
of
1970
is
based
on
important
part
on
a
policy
of
non-degradation
of
existing
clear
air
and
that
40
cfr
51.12(b)
in
permitting
the
states
to
submit
plans,
which
allow
pollution
levels
of
clean
air
to
rise
to
the
secondary
standard
of
pollution.
it
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
policy
of
the
act
and
is
therefore
invalid.
now
admittedly
the
court
then
went
on
in
the
next
section
under
injunctive
relief
to
say
there
was
likelihood
of
success
but
in
fact
what
the
parties
did
is
interpret
that
sentence
that
i
have
just
read
to
you
as
an
effect
to
final
conclusion
that
that
regulation
was
invalid.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
we
so
stipulated.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
correct
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
its
order
of
course
has
been
pointed
out
it
didn’t
(inaudible)
any
other
matters.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
end
effect
by
that
point
at
least
and
interpreted
as
the
stipulation
indicates
to
be
a
final
judgment.
so
probably
the
only
thing
we
do
agree
with
the
government
in
the
case
is
that
this,
we
think
of
final
judgment,
which
is
before
the
court
and
should
be
treated
as
such.
this
case
your
honors
involves
the
air
quality
of
most
of
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
well
it
talked
about
both.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
both
said
the
regulation
was
invalid
and
said
there
was
a
probability
of
success.
i
would
read
that
to
say
that
since
the
regulation
was
invalid
indeed
there
was
probability
of
success.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honors,
this
case
involves
the
air
quality
of
most
of
the
united
states.
it
involves
any
area
where
air
quality
is
better
than
one
or
more
of
the
secondary
standards
for
the
six
pollutants
and
therefore
this
case
will
vitally
effect
all
rural
areas,
suburban
areas
and
even
a
great
many
urban
areas.
petitioner
adopted
a
regulation,
which
would
allow
all
these
areas,
the
air
in
them
to
deteriorate
to
the
secondary
standards.
we
believe
that
the
result
will
be
massive
deterioration
of
air
quality
both
measured
by
the
area
affected
and
by
the
total
pollution
emitted
into
the
air.
while
the
pollution
in
cities
will
be
lowered
under
the
statute
to
the
secondary
standards
over
the
next
few
years
and
many
particularly
clean
areas
pollution
will
increase
five,
ten,
or
even
more
times.
since
there
will
be
an
increase
in
pollution
in
far
more
areas
than
it
will
be
reduced,
a
vast
increase
in
pollution
will
result.
now
this
is
no
mere
theoretical
possibility.
pollution
has
increased
drastically
in
the
formerly
almost
pure
air
of
the
southwest,
as
coal-burning
power
plants
have
been
located
there
over
the
last
few
years.
any
air
traveler
can
see
the
haze
hanging
over
that
area.
epa
itself
has
found
that
even
the
grand
canyon
is
threatened
with
air
pollution.
plants
from
montana
and
wyoming
are
even
more
threatening.
proposed
coal-burning
power
plants
there
would
emit
five
to
ten
times
the
air
pollution
of
new
york
city
and
los
angeles
combined.
we
submit
that
these
are
only
the
most
dramatic
examples
of
what
will
occur
if
the
unanimous
decisions
of
the
courts
below
are
reversed
and
petitioner’s
regulation
is
approved.
an
even
blanket
of
air
pollution
will
spread
across
the
country.
the
pollution
level
will
be
approximately
the
same
from
coast
to
coast
as
it
now
is
for
example
as
to
sulfur
oxides
in
particulates
in
boston,
detroit,
and
pittsburg.
in
protest
against
this
massive
deterioration
air
quality,
20
states
have
filed
briefs
as
amici
in
support
of
respondents
in
this
court
to
challenge
petitioner’s
policy.
respondents
submit
the
petitioner’s
regulation
is
invalid
because
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
language
of
the
clean
air
act
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
theoretically,
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
as
a
practical
matter
what
happens
is
that
there
would
be
competition
among
states
for
having
the
lowest
air
pollution
standard.
let
me
give
an
explicit
example.
arizona
supports
the
government
in
this
case.
new
mexico
supports
respondents.
both
of
them
are
now
threatened
with
coal-burning
power
plants
that
will
add
drastically
to
air
pollution.
if
new
mexico
imposes,
a
very
strict
standard
then
those
power
plants
will
be
built
in
arizona
but
new
mexico
will
get
the
dirty
air
from
arizona
and
so
the
net
result
to
new
mexico
will
be
that
they
will
still
get
their
air
pollution
but
they
will
not
get
the
economic
benefits
of
the
power
plants.
now
what
these
states
are
arguing
is
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
national
requirement
as
they
believe
the
law
provides
that
there
would
be
no
significant
deterioration
of
clean
air
then
the
rule
they
will
be
the
same
nationally,
then
industry
will
not
locate
it
one
street
versus
another
because
of
the
low
air
pollution
standard
that
industry
will
then
use
all
of
its
funds
and
resources
to
develop
methods
for
not
significantly
deteriorating
the
air
and
still
being
able
to
do
the
things,
which
the
country
needs
to
have
done.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
did
--
it’s
an
exact
--
we
think
in
exact
parallel,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right
and
that
of
course
is
what
president
nixon
said
in
proposing
the
1970
statute
and
we
have
cited
a
number
of
studies
in
our
brief
which
shows
that
air
pollution
moves
long
distances
across
state
lines
that
there
was
a
serious
air
pollution
problem
in
miami
which
came
from
the
northeast
that
there
have
been
serious
air
pollution
problems
in
oklahoma
which
came
from
the
great
lake
states.
there
is
no
way
for
a
state
to
protect
its
air
by
prohibiting
significant
deterioration
unless
the
other
states
that
are
nearby
also
do
the
same.
now,
we
submit
that
the
statute
itself
is
clear.
the
congress
called
the
1970
amendments
the
clean
air
act
and
that
that
act
states
as
the
first
of
its
purposes
that
it
was
designed
to
protect
and
enhance
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
air
resources.
we
submit
the
petitioner’s
regulation
cannot
produce
clean
air
and
will
not
enhance
or
even
maintain
existing
air
property
and
we
believe
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statutes.
but
whether
or
not
the
statutory
language
itself
is
clear
enough,
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
is
overwhelming.
it
is
interesting
that
the
government
in
oral
argument
here
has
not
eluded
it
all
to
this
legislative
history.
in
fact,
they
have
not
in
either
of
their
two
briefs
alluded
to
some
of
the
most
important
elements
of
it.
let
me
just
briefly
state
what
those
are.
first
in
1967,
the
protect
and
enhance
language
was
first
put
into
the
act.
the
senate
report
said
that
this
language
was
designed
to
enhance
air
quality
and
to
reduce
harmful
emissions
anywhere
in
the
country
not
just
in
areas
of
high
pollution.
the
history
of
the
1970
act
which
section
--
which
left
section
1857
unchanged
is
even
more
clear.
john
benjamin,
then
the
undersecretary
of
the
hew
which
enforced
the
air
pollution
law
at
that
time
read
a
statement
on
behalf
of
secretary
finch
and
the
administration
to
both
the
senate
and
house
committees
considering
the
1970
act.
and
this
statement
is
on
pages
27
to
28
of
our
red
brief.
it
says,
“one
of
the
expressed
purposes
of
the
clean
air
act
is
to
protect
and
enhance
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
air
resources.
accordingly,
it
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
our
view
that
implementation
plans
that
would
permit
significant
deterioration
of
air
quality
in
any
area
would
be
in
conflict
with
this
provision
of
the
act.”
we
submit
that’s
our
case.
that
those
two
sentences
are
an
all
force
with
our
contention.
that
that
language
prohibits
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it’s
on
pages
27
to
28.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
first
sentence
of
that
--
oh,
i
did
your
honor
that
that
is
to
protect
and
enhance
language.
now,
the
first
sentence
of
what
i
just
read
to
you,
your
honor
was
the
statute.
what
--
let
me
go
back,
the
first
sentence
of
what
secretary
benjamin
said
was
one
of
the
expressed
purposes
of
the
clean
air
act
is,
and
then
he
starts
to
quote
the
statute,
“to
protect
and
enhance
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
air
resources,”
that’s
the
end
of
his
quote
of
the
statute.
then
he
says,
“accordingly
based
on
that
provision
of
the
statute
it
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
our
view
that
implementation
plans
they
would
permit
significant
deterioration
of
air
quality
in
any
area
would
be
in
conflict
with
this
provision
of
the
act.”
so
what
he
is
saying
is,
that
provision
of
the
statute
prohibits
significant
deterioration
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
he
is
not
your
honor.
now,
i
will
get
on
to
what
congress
response
was.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
at
least
in
the
sense.
first
of
all,
we
think
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
indicates
that
a
massive
deterioration
of
air
quality
was
not
intended
by
congress,
that
that
is
not
consistent
with
protecting
and
enhance
air
quality.
second
to
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
administration
coming
up,
the
people
that
enforce
this
statute
coming
up
and
telling
congress
that
a
provision
of
the
statute
prohibits
significant
deterioration.
congress
passes
sweeping
amendments
in
1970
to
strengthen
the
act.
it
leaves
that
provision
unchanged.
now,
we
submit
that
when
the
enforcers
of
the
statute
come
to
congress
and
say,
“this
is
what
this
provision
means,”
and
congress
although
modifying
almost
the
whole
rest
of
the
act
does
not
touch
that
section
that
that
is
at
least
persuasive.
now,
i
will
get
on
to
what
the
congress
though
itself
said,
because
i
think
that’s
important.
now,
secretary
benjamin
also
repeated
that
statement
in
effect
in
his
own
words.
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
committee
which
was
considering
the
1970
legislation,
our
witness
representing
the
chemical
industry
protested
that
the
bill
before
congress
would
constitute
an
unqualified
edict
against
any
or
every
degradation
because
the
standards
would
apply
to
all
area
regions
that
are
now
were
recreational
or
otherwise
unindustrialized.
he
therefore
proposed
a
flexible
provision
for
balancing
the
equities
as
to
each
area
in
place
of
the
national
prohibition
against
significant
deterioration.
congressman
rogers
who
was
on
the
committee,
a
ranking
member
of
the
committee
responded
by
vigorously
opposing
this
proposal
because
it
would
allow
clean
air
areas
to
be
polluted,
so
that
the
country
would
be
faced
with
having
to
clean
them
up
later.
mr.
rogers’
statement
is
on
page
31
of
our
brief.
the
committee
left
intact
section
1857
which
prohibited
deterioration
according
to
the
administration
witnesses.
in
addition,
the
house
report,
we
think
clearly
adopted
congressman
roger’s
position
because
it
said
that
significant
--
that
it
effectively
said
that
significant
deterioration
was
prohibited
by
stating
the
following,
“the
war
against
the
air
pollution
will
be
carried
out
throughout
the
nation
rather
than
only
on
particular
geographical
areas.”
and
then
he
went
on
to
say,
“effective
pollution
control
requires
both
reduction
of
present
pollution
and
prevention
of
new
significant
pollution
problems.
that’s
almost
identical
what
congressman
rogers
had
said
in
response
to
the
witness.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
senate
report
which
underlies
the
1970
act.
first
it
said
that
the
statute
applied
nationally
and
did
not
apply
just
uniquely
critical
areas.
it
then
made
clear
that
no
state
plan
permitting
significant
deterioration
of
air
quality
should
be
approved
by
saying
first
deterioration
of
air
quality
should
not
be
permitted
except
under
circumstances
where
there
is
no
available
alternative.
now,
if
they
stop
there
obviously
what
congress
would
have
meant
would
have
been
that
in
some
instances
at
least,
significant
deterioration
could
be
allowed.
but
then
the
committee
went
on
to
say
that
alternatives
existed,
it
listed
the
alternatives
and
said
deterioration
need
not
occur.
and
that’s
on
page
32
of
our
brief.
now,
the
language
upon
which
the
statement
was
based
section
1857
was
in
the
1967
act
and
was
not
changed
by
the
1970
statute.
petitioner
claims
that
the
senate
bill
was
later
changed
before
its
adoption.
the
only
subsequent
changes
in
the
bill
after
the
senate
report
and
this
is
basically
a
senate
bill
were
to
tighten
the
provisions
designed
to
reduce
pollution
in
dirty
air
areas,
in
other
words
in
the
cities.
the
tightening
of
controls
as
to
dirty
air
areas
obviously
cannot
lead
to
any
inference.
the
congress
intended
to
weaken
the
bill’s
provisions
as
to
clean
air
areas.
now,
petitioner
in
its
reply
brief
quotes
at
considerable
length
summaries
of
the
1970
act
and
says
that
if
this
very
important
provision
were
intended
by
congress
to
apply
to
across
the
county,
why
was
it
not
in
this
congressional
summaries
of
the
act?
there
is
a
simple
answer
to
this
contention
and
that
is
section
1857
was
not
in
the
1970
act.
it
was
in
the
1967
act.
the
1970
statute
contained
only
amendments
to
the
1967
statute
and
since
congress
after
being
informed
that
section
1857
prohibited
significant
deterioration
decided
to
retain
this
provision
without
amendment,
it
was
not
in
the
1970
act.
therefore
it
is
natural
that
the
summaries
of
the
1970
act
did
not
include
a
summary
of
a
provision
which
was
not
in
the
statute.
we
submit
that
the
--
not
only
as
the
legislative
history
strongly
support
of
our
position
but
the
contemporaneous
and
consistent
administrative
interpretation
until
1971
was
likewise
the
section
1857
prohibited
significant
deterioration.
counsel
has
said
that
epa
has
long
said
that
implementation
plans
could
not
prohibit
that
there
was
no
requirement
that
implementation
plans
had
to
prohibit
significant
deterioration.
that
long
standing
rule
goes
back
to
august
1971.
in
1969,
the
national
air
pollution
control
administrations
which
then
enforce
the
statute
gave
the
states
guidelines
for
its
implementation
plans.
under
the
heading
of
requirements
of
the
air
quality
act,
the
states
were
told
and
this
on
page
26
of
our
brief,
an
explicit
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
protect
and
enhance
the
quality
of
the
nation’s
air
resources.
again,
they
were
quoting
section
1857
from
the
statute.
air
quality
standards
which
even
if
fully
implemented
would
result
in
significant
deterioration
of
air
quality
and
any
substantial
portions
of
an
air
quality
region
clearly
would
conflict
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
the
law.
so
what
hew
told
the
states
in
1969
was
this
identical
language
prohibited
significant
deterioration
then
secretaries
finch
and
benjamin
told
the
congress,
both
houses
of
congress
the
same
thing
in
1970
as
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
their
interpretation
of
the
1970
administration
bill.
two
other
hew
officials,
high
officials
told
congressional
committees
the
same
thing
in
1969
and
1970.
and
in
1971,
petitioner
promulgated
his
own
national
primary
and
secondary
standards
which
we
think
plainly
stated,
the
standard
shall
not
be
considered
in
any
manner
to
allow
significant
deterioration
of
existing
air
quality
in
any
portion
of
any
state.
we
submit
those
regulations
despite
the
rather
elaborate
attempt
to
explain
a
way
that
language
is
directly
inconsistent
with
the
regulation
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
now
petitioner,
principally
relies
on
section
110
of
the
act
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
august
1971.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
they
didn’t
replace.
we
have
at
the
moment,
we
have
two
inconsistent
regulations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right
your
honor.
what
we
have
now
are
two
documents
in
effect.
we
have
the
national
primary
and
secondary
air
quality
standards
which
we
believe
clearly
prohibits
significant
deterioration
and
then
we
have
requirements
for
preparation
adoption
and
submittal
of
the
implementation
plans
which
has
the
language
which
we
challenged
which
permits
significant
deterioration.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right.
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
don’t
rely
on
it
because
we
think
the
statute
in
its
legislative
history
make
the
regulation
invalid.
we
rely
on
that
for
the
proposition
that
the
administrator
continued
even
into
1971
to
believe
that
the
statute
prohibited
significant
deterioration.
even
if
we
were
wrong,
i
am
at
interpretation
and
the
government’s
we
think
rather
strained
interpretation
of
that
regulation
is
correct.
we
still
believe
that
the
statute
in
this
legislative
history
and
earlier
administrative
interpretation
are
conclusive.
we
note
particularly,
your
honors,
that
of
course
when
one
is
looking
to
administrative
interpretation
to
get
the
greatest
way
to
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
the
contemporaneous
administrative
interpretation
which
is
most
persuasive.
and
that
of
course,
occurred
repeatedly
in
1969
and
1970.
as
i
indicated
before
we
think
the
harder,
what
the
government
is
arguing
is
that
section
110
is
conclusive
on
this
case
that
it
provides
the
only
criteria
from
which
the
administrator
can
reject
the
state
plan.
and
that
these
criteria
do
not
include
a
prohibition
on
significant
deterioration.
we
believe
that
this
contention
is
wrong
for
several
different
reasons.
first,
the
language
of
section
1857
specifically
states
that
it
implies
to
the
entire
statute
and
we
submit
that
means
it
applies
to
section
110
like
it
applies
to
everything
else
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
need
to
restate
the
prohibition
against
significant
deterioration
in
section
110
or
any
other
portion
of
the
act.
since
congress
had
been
repeatedly
told
at
least
on
four
different
occasions
that
section
1857
prohibited
significant
deterioration,
congress
obviously
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
add
another
provision
in
section
110
but
decided
to
simply
to
leave
section
1857
unchanged.
second,
section
110
allows
the
petitioner
as
petitioner
emphasizes
to
enforce
the
national
standards.
since
section
1857
applies
to
the
entire
act,
we
think
it
is
clear
the
congress
intended
the
prohibition
against
significant
deterioration
to
be
part
of
the
national
standards.
this
construction
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
statement
in
the
senate
report
that
state
implementation
plans
may
not
permit
significant
deterioration
is
part
of
the
report’s
discussion
of
the
national
standards.
and
if
there’s
doubt
about
this,
petitioner
himself
is
included
a
prohibition
against
significant
deterioration
in
the
national
standard
which
he
promulgated.
third,
section
110
or
language
comparable
to
it
was
contained
in
the
1967
statute,
the
1970
bills
considered
by
congress
and
the
1970
statute.
nevertheless,
both
high
federal
officials
and
congressional
committees
stated
repeatedly
that
section
1857
requires
state
implementation
plans
to
prevent
significant
deterioration.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right,
your
honor.
i
want
to
be
clear,
i
doubt
if
we
would
be
here
if
that
language
stood
all
by
itself
that
there
was
no
explanation
of
it
anywhere
but
what
we
have
is
the
repeated
statements
both
in
congress
and
by
high
administration
officials
charged
with
interpreting
that
statute
saying
that
that
language
explicitly
prohibited
significant
deterioration.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
that’s
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
however,
your
honor,
it’s
interesting
that
the
same
thing
occurred
under
the
earlier
water
pollution
laws
that
enforcers
there
interpreted
the
purpose
sections
to
prohibit
significant
deterioration.
it
seems
to
me
what’s
so
critical
about
this
is
that
congress
made
clear
that
it
wanted
to
prohibit
significant
deterioration.
the
administration
told
them
that
this
had
already
been
done.
they
now
come
back
after
congress
has
acted
in
1970
and
to
say,
well,
that
statute
that
we
told
you
prohibited
significant
deterioration
really
doesn’t
do
so.
it
means
in
effect
that
congress
when
it
was
considering
these
amendments
never
got
the
chance
to
put
into
the
statute
specific
language.
now,
we
believe
that
to
protect
an
enhance
language
is
at
the
very
least
strongly
indicative
of
our
position.
we
think
that
a
mass
of
deterioration
of
air
quality
in
this
country
cannot
possibly
be
consistent
with
the
statute
which
requires
that
the
air
quality
be
protected
and
enhanced.
when
i
said
that
we
would
not
be
here
on
that
language
alone,
what
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
language
is
the
--
no,
your
honor.
that
language
is
the
identical
language
which
was
relied
on
by
the
administration
repeatedly
in
1969
and
1970
and
was
relied
on
by
the
senate
report.
there
was
no
other
language.
no
language
was
ever
taken
out
of
the
statute
which
could
possibly
be
the
justification
for
earlier
statements
that
significant
deterioration
was
prohibited
and
therefore
one
could
argue
that
the
present
law
did
not
include
that
prohibition.
in
fact,
i
think
that
gets
to
a
critical
point.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
he
had
said
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
unless
what
mr.
benjamin
thought
and
the
administration
thought
on
repeated
statements
was
that
that
purpose
section
was
meant
to
have
operative
effect.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
right.
he
would
have
said
this
section
prohibits
significant
deterioration.
he
didn’t
say
it.
that
is
exactly
the
language
i
quoted
to
you.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
exactly
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
that
would
be
possible
except
for
that
isn’t
what
was
said
to
congress.
what
congress
was
told
was
that
significant
deterioration
would
conflict
what
the
express
purpose
of
the
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
can
only
read
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
the
language
what
was
told
to
congress.
congress
was
told
that
significant
deterioration
would
conflict
with
the
law.
it
didn’t
say
that
congress
was
not
told
the
administrator
could
find
that
that
he
have
the
option
to
do
it.
it
was
said
that
the
law
itself
was
in
conflict
with
significant
deterioration.
i
submit
that
that
was
clear
as
one
can
be
the
question
was
not
raised
obviously
in
the
direct
form
that
your
honor
has
just
raised
it
with
me.
but
it
was
said
over
and
over
again
and
for
example
when
the
witness
before
the
house
committee
said,
“the
statute
was
an
unqualified
edict.”
congressman
rogers
says,
“that’s
right
and
we’re
going
to
keep
it
there.”
and
the
house
committee
did
keep
it
there.
and
the
house
committee
said
the
reason
we
are
keeping
it
there
is
because
we
want
to
prevent
new
pollution
problems
from
arising.
now
what
the
government
is
in
effect
saying
is
that
the
night
--
and
i
think
there
isn’t
much
doubt
about
this,
that
they
--
the
very
least
they
suggests
this
that
the
1967
statute
did
prohibit
significant
deterioration
but
now
it
does
not.
now,
that
is
in
effect
an
argument
that
was
has
happened
is
that
there
has
been
a
repeal
by
implication
because
the
language
is
identical.
it
was
not
changed
by
the
1970
act.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
would
think
that
would
be
considerable
less,
your
honor.
i
mean
this
was
a
statement
by
the
highest
administration
official
charge
with
enforcing
this
particular
statute.
and
i
think
under
the
well
recognize
principles
of
statutory
construction
that’s
entitled
to
very
considerable
weight.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i’m,
i’m
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
it
is
entitled
to
a
very
great
deal
of
weight
but
it
doesn’t
stand
alone
your
honor.
it
stands
with
mr.
johnson,
who
was
the
next
man
under
mr.
benjamin
on
this
subject
saying
the
same
thing
to
congress
in
1969.
dr.
middleton
said
the
same
thing
to
the
congress
in
1970.
the
official
guidelines
of
the
agency
which
enforce
the
statutes
said
the
same
thing
in
1969.
the
senate
reports
says
the
same
thing
in
1970.
i
think
i
can
answer
quite
whether
i
would
urge
to
your
honor
that
if
this
stood
all
by
itself
whether
this
would
be
sufficient
i
think
we
would
argue
that
it
is
sufficient
but
there
is
such
a
massive
legislative
history
here
and
administrative
history
that
there
is
no
need
to
look
at
one
isolated
sentence.
now
the
interesting
thing
is
really
the
government
doesn’t
have
any
substantial
answer
to
this.
what
the
reply
brief
says
and
i
guess
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
answer
to
most
of
this.
it’s
in
the
second
sentence.
at
the
most
this
legislative
history
indicates
that
some
individuals
testifying
on
the
bills
and
even
some
congressman
believe
in
the
policy
of
non-deterioration
would
be
advisable.
well,
that
seems
to
me
are
the
weak
way
of
describing
what
secretaries
finch
and
benjamin
were
saying,
they
came
to
the
hill
as
the
official
spokesman
of
the
people
that
enforce
statute.
we
have
senate
report.
we
have
a
house
report.
those
reports
don’t
say
it’s
advisable.
they
say
the
statute
requires
it.
that
any
allowance
of
significant
deterioration
would
be
inconsistent
would
be
in
conflict
with
this
provision
and
we
submit
that
that
ought
to
be
sufficient.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
which
applies
to
section
110.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
my
argument
is
two-fold,
and
they
are,
first
of
all,
1857
in
terms
applies
to
section
110
as
it
does
to
every
other
section
of
the
statute.
that’s
the
first
argument
on
the
proposition.
an
additional
argument
is
that
we
think
that
means
that
this
is
prohibition
on
significant
deterioration
is
part
of
the
national
standards.
in
fact
the
administrator
has
made
it
part
of
the
national
standards.
now,
if
you
look
through
the
list
of
the
reasons
one
can
turn
down
an
implementation
plan
in
section
110.
everybody
agrees
that
one
reason
for
turning
it
down
is
it
does
not
comply
with
the
national
standards.
these
made
it
a
part
of
the
national
standards;
we
think
he
had
to
because
section
1857
applies
to
the
entire
statute.
let
me
just
make
one
final
point
because
i
know
the
red
light
is
on
and
that
is
all
the
statements
that
i
have
talked
about
secretaries
finch
and
benjamin,
the
house
report,
the
senate
report,
the
other
legislative
administrative
history
all
apply
to
a
statute
which
either
had
the
identical
provision
as
section
110
or
was
--
had
a
provision
similar
to
section
110
in
the
sense
that
they
require
the
administrator
to
approve
implementation
plans
if
they
met
certain
criteria
which
did
not
include
explicitly
under
within
that
section,
section
110.
so
all
these
legislative
history,
administrative
history
goes
directly
to
this
point
of
what
section
110
means
in
conjunction
with
section
1857.
thank
you
your
honors.
