mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
under
the
federal
clean
air
act
amendments
of
1970.
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
i’ve
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
to
each
member
of
the
court
a
pamphlet
containing
the
full
provisions
of
the
clean
air
act
as
amended
in
through
the
1970
amendments,
plus
two
excerpts
from
the
federal
register
reproducing
completely
the
parts
of
the
administrator’s
regulations
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
so
that
all
of
these
provisions
can
be
seen
in
full
context.
the
1970
amendments
greatly
strengthened
the
act
in
a
number
of
ways
and
among
other
things,
the
amendments
for
the
first
time
provided
for
federally
prescribed
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
for
federal
standards
before
emissions
from
new
stationary
sources
of
pollutants.
the
ambient
air
quality
standards
apply
to
the
presence
of
pollutants
in
the
overall
air
in
a
community
or
region
covered
by
the
standards
and
the
emission
standards
also
referred
to
as
performance
standards
in
the
act
apply
to
the
emissions
of
pollutants
from
a
single
point
source.
under
the
1970
amendments,
each
state
is
required
to
submit
a
plan
for
implementing
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
those
plans
also
have
to
prevent
deterioration
of
existing
air
quality
in
any
portion
of
any
state.
the
administrator
has
taken
the
position
of
the
act
does
not
require
or
permit
him
to
require
the
states
to
include
such
a
non-deterioration
provision
in
their
plans
although
it
preserves
the
right
of
the
states
to
do
so
if
they
wish.
respondents
brought
this
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
the
contrary
of
the
administrator’s
position
and
to
direct
the
administrator
to
disapprove
the
state
plans
that
have
been
submitted
in
so
far
as
they
do
not
prevent
significant
deterioration
of
existing
air
quality
in
any
part
of
any
state.
the
district
court
upheld
the
claim
of
the
respondents
on
the
basis
of
the
act’s
statement
of
purposes
and
on
the
basis
of
the
court’s
view
of
the
ex-legislative
history
and
what
the
court
regarded
as
inconsistency
in
the
administrator’s
regulations.
it
issued
a
preliminary
injunction,
which
the
parties
agreed
to
treat
as
a
final
order
for
purposes
of
appeal
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
district
court’s
opinion.
this
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
government’s
application
for
a
stay
pending
its
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
parties
agreed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
parties
agreed
that
it
involved
the
controlling
issue
of
law
that
settled
the
rights
between
the
parties.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
not
your
honor
because
what
this
court
is
reviewing
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
basis
of
the
district’s
court’s
opinion
as
to
the
legal
issues
but
on
the
basis
of
the
submission
of
parties
that
this
was
the
controlling
legal
issue
that
would
govern
the
practice
of
the
administrator
and
whether
the
administrator
could
approve
or
disapprove
the
state
plans
that
are
pending
before
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
the
rationale
of
the
district
court’s
memorandum
opinion
is
not
based
on
probabilities
at
all.
it’s
based
on
the
controlling
legal
issues
that
interprets
the
statute
and
in
effect
invalidates
the
administrator’s
regulations.
there
is
nothing
in
that
opinion
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
it’s
based
on
probabilities
or
preliminary
concerns
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
court
said
initially
this
matter
came
before
the
court
in
that
posture.
but
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
was
not
intended
as
just
for
the
part
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
an
injunction
is
appealable
so
long
as
it
then
joins
the
enforcement
of
a
federal
statute.
a
temporary
restraining
order
would
not
have
been
appealable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
terms
of
the
stipulation,
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
pointed
out
plus
the
chronological
situation.
the
preliminary
injunction
was
issued
by
the
district
court
the
day
before
the
final
day
under
the
statute
when
the
administrator
had
to
approve
or
disapprove
all
of
these
data
implementation
plans.
the
suit
was
brought
one
week
before
the
statutory
deadline.
the
district
court
ahead
to
act
rapidly
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
regarded
this
as
a
matter
for
rapid
disposition
because
the
statutes
specifies
this
very
tight
deadlines
for
implementation
of
the
act.
and
that
is
the
question
that
has
been
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here.
the
governing
legal
question
which
both
parties
understood
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
deciding
on
the
basis
of
this
stipulation.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
anything
else.
ordinarily,
one
would
think
that
they
were
rejecting
the
stipulated
legal
issue
that
was
before
them
and
deciding
something
else,
they
would
have
said
so.
the
parties
agreed
what
the
legal
issue
was
and
we
think
that
that
issue
was
the
question
that
is
now
presented
in
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
--
and
its
answer
was
based
on
what
the
parties
regarded
as
the
governing
legal
question.
that’s
the
question
we
presented
in
our
petition
and
the
question
to
which
i
would
like
to
devote
the
remainder
of
my
argument
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
not
the
issue
that
the
parties
stipulated
where
it
was
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals.
and
one
presumes
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
stipulated
issue
that
the
parties
said
it
was
deciding,
it
would
have
indicated
as
much
and
even
if
the
case
has
to
be
regarded
as
limited
in
its
posture
to
whether
there
was
an
abusive
discretion
with
respect
to
the
preliminary
injunction,
our
position
is
that
the
legal
issue
is
a
clear
one
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
that
this
court
should
decide
it.
in
that
context,
if
it
regards,
it
is
presented
in
this
context,
which
we
don’t
regard
as
the
context
in
which
it
is
presented.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
not
regarded
as
a
shortcut
at
all.
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
expectation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
without
any
opinion
of
their
own.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it
was
not
mandatory
for
this
court
to
grant
certiorari.
we
petitioned
and
we
presented
the
governing
legal
question
as
the
question
presented
in
the
petition.
we
think
that
question
is
here
in
either
context.
now
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
evaluating
the
probability
of
success
of
the
legal
issues
does
not
discuss
any
of
the
operative
provisions
of
the
act.
although
in
our
view,
congress
in
these
provisions
answered
with
complete
clarity
and
with
great
specificity
the
underlying
legal
question
that’s
before
this
court
and
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
these
operative
provisions
of
the
act.
in
the
pamphlet
that’s
been
passed
out
to
the
justices.
the
structure
of
the
act
relevant
here
begins
with
section
108
on
page
9
of
this
pamphlet
which
specifies
that,
“the
administrator
is
to
adopt
criteria
for
each
of
the
individual
pollutants
to
be
found
in
the
ambient
air”
and
the
administrator
has
done
so
with
respect
to
all
of
the
common
pollutants
whether
additional
ones
will
be
added
remains
subject
to
continuing
review.
then
section
109
on
page
10
specifies,
“that
the
administrator
on
the
basis
of
these
criteria
for
individual
pollutants
then
will
adopt
what
are
called
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards.”
two
standards
are
to
be
adopted
by
the
administrator
and
have
been
adopted
by
the
administrator.
our
national
primary
ambient
air
quality
standard
defined
as
standard
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health
and
the
national
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standard
defined
at
the
top
of
page
11
as
requisite
to
protect
the
public
welfare
from
any
known
or
anticipated
adverse
effects.
and
public
welfare
is
very
broadly
defined
on
page
48
of
this
pamphlet
in
the
act.
section
300
2
(h)
which
says,
“that
all
language
referring
to
effects
on
welfare
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
effects
on
soils,
water,
crops,
vegetation,
man-made
materials,
animals,
wildlife,
weather,
visibility
and
climate
damage
to,
and
deterioration
of
property
and
hazards
to
transportation
as
well
as
effects
on
economic
values
and
on
personal
comfort
and
well-being.”
these
standards
are
very
far
reaching
and
have
been
adopted.
they
are
not
subject
to
collateral
review
in
this
case
for
reasons
explained
in
our
brief.
there
is
a
statutory
provision
specifying
another
word
for
review
of
the
standards.
so
this
case
was
decided
and
should
be
decided
on
the
premise
that
the
standards
adopted
by
the
administrator
are
fully
adequate
to
prevent
in
the
ambient
air
any
known
or
anticipated
adverse
effects
on
health,
vegetation,
and
all
of
the
other
factors
covered
in
the
statute.
the
standards
themselves
are
subject
to
continuous
review
and
revision
by
the
administrator
as
additional
scientific
information
becomes
available.
but
these
are
stringent
standards.
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
of
the
view
that
many
urban
areas
will
have
extreme
difficulty
conforming
even
to
the
primary
standard
and
even
greater
difficulty
conforming
to
the
secondary
standard.
now,
the
key
provision
for
purposes
of
this
case
is
section
110
entitled
implementation
plans.
and
that
title
is
in
the
public
law
in
the
statute’s
at
large
all
of
these
titles
are
and
that
section
requires
each
stay
to
adopt
and
submit
a
plan
providing
for
the
implementation
maintenance
enforcement
of
the
primary
standard
and
a
plan
providing
for
implementation
maintenance
enforcement
and
enforcement
of
the
secondary
standard.
that’s
all
in
a
110
(a)
(1)
and
then
110
(a)
(2)
specifies
that
the
administrator
shall,
the
second
sentence
of
that,
shall
approve
such
plan
submitted
to
him
or
any
portion
thereof.
if
he
determines
that
it
was
adopted
after
reasonable
notice
and
hearing
and
that,
and
then
they
are
listed
a
through
h.
eight
additional
requirements
that
the
plan
must
meet
and
if
it
meets
those
eight
requirements
and
it
was
adopted
after
reasonable
notice
and
hearing,
the
act
says
on
its
face
the
administrator
shall
approve
it.
it
is
undisputed
that
none
of
these
eight
requirements
are
--
adds
a
requirement
that
the
plan
provide
against
significant
deterioration
of
existing
air
quality
other
than
the
requirement
that
the
primary
and
secondary
standards
be
met,
which
is
part
a.
the
others
are
all
concerned
with
different
subject
matter
and
are
tied
in
with
meeting
the
primary
and
secondary
standards.
now
we
think
it
is
significant
that
this
provision
does
not
even
say
the
administrator
shall
not
approve
such
plan
unless
it
meets
these
criteria.
it
speaks
in
the
positive
in
the
mandatory
sense
he
shall
approve
but
if
it
does
meet
these
standards.
it
has
long
been
the
view
of
the
agency
of
that
if
a
plan
were
submitted
by
a
state,
which
admittedly
met
all
the
standards
and
yet
disapproved
it;
it
would
have
a
very
week
position
in
court
if
sued
by
that
state.
and
it
did
not
think
it
could
prevail
in
such
a
suit
and
of
course
the
case
did
not
arise
in
that
context.
now
in
addition
to,
i
might
add
that
there
are
other
portions
of
section
110,
which
reaffirm
that
the
plans
or
implementation
plans
for
these
federally
prescribed
standards.
i
refer
the
court
in
particular
to
subpart
h
there
in
this
list
of
eight
requirements,
which
says
that
the
plan
must
provide
for
revision
and
number
2,
whenever
the
administrator
finds
on
the
basis
of
information
available
to
him
that
the
plan
is
substantially
inadequate
to
achieve
the
national
ambient
air
quality
primary
or
secondary
standard.
not
that’s
inadequate
for
some
other
purpose.
the
only
definition
of
the
plan
in
the
act
is
subpart
d
on
page
13
in
section
110,
which
says,
“for
purposes
of
this
act
an
applicable
implementation
plan
is
the
implementation
plan
which
has
been
approved
under
subsection
(a)
are
promulgated
by
the
administrator
under
subsection
(c)
in
which
implements
the
national
primary
or
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standard
in
the
state.”
the
act
provides
for
an
additional
requirement
and
that
is
the
section
111
requirement
on
performance
standards
for
new
stationary
sources.
this
is
a
part
from
the
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
quality
requirements
and
i
won’t
have
time
to
go
into
that
in
any
detail.
but
it
is
significant
that
the
act
defines
standard
of
performance
to
mean
at
the
beginning
of
section
111,
“a
standard
for
emissions
of
air
pollutants,
which
reflects
the
degree
of
emission
limitation
achievable
through
the
application
of
the
best
system
of
emission
reduction
which
taking
into
account
the
cost
of
achieving
such
reduction.
the
administrator
determines
has
been
adequately
demonstrated.”
now,
all
of
this
indicates
that
there
are
two
requirements
being
imposed
by
the
act.
one
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
the
other,
emission
limitation
requirements,
which
not
preclude
new
development
that
which
impose
a
practical
best
available
limitation
taking
cost
into
account
as
a
protection
that
applies
as
well
to
areas
where
the
existing
air
quality
exceeds
that
of
the
primary
and
secondary
standards.
and
then
section
116
of
the
act
specifies
that
the
states
are
free
to
adopt
more
stringent
standards
for
the
ambient
air
if
they
care
to
do
so.
and
this
is
in
keeping
with
the
finding
recited
in
section
101
(a)
(3)
of
the
act
that
the
prevention
in
control
of
air
pollution
at
its
source
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
states
and
local
governments.
now
this
interpretation
of
the
act
is
also
corroborated
by
other
in
court
into
provisions
of
the
act.
the
entire
structure
of
the
act
looks
toward
these
implementation
plans
as
being
just
what
they
are
called
plans
to
implement
the
primary
and
secondary
standards.
section
107
(a)
of
the
act
on
page
8
succinctly
spells
out
what
the
states
responsibility
is
and
again
it’s
just
have
been
an
implementation
plan
for
such
state
which
will
specify
the
manner
in
which
national
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standards
will
be
achieved
in
and
maintained.
and
then
one
of
the
most
persuasive
provisions
further
corroborating
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
the
entire
scheme
of
it
is
to
be
found
on
page
41
of
the
pamphlet
of
the
act
and
that
is
section
211
(c)
(4)
(c),
the
capital
c
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page
on
page
41.
i
apologize
that
this
was
a
mistakenly
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief
as
section
210.
it
is
actually
section
211.
subpart
4
basically,
preempts
the
states
from
regulating
fuels
or
fuel
additives.
but
this
subpart
capital
c
says
that
the
administrator
may
however
approve
a
provision
regulating
fuels
or
fuel
additives
and
implementation
plans
or
promulgate
an
implementation
plan
containing
such
a
provision
but
only
if
he
finds
that
the
state
control
or
prohibition
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
national
primary
or
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standard,
which
the
plan
implements.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
50
plans
have
been
submitted
to
the
administrator.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
disapproved
them
in
so
far
as
they
do
not
comply
with
the
district
court’s
order
in
this
case.
but
they
don’t
contain
any
enforcement
mechanism
consistent
with
the
district
court’s
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
that
we’ve
dropped
that
contention
in
this
court.
all
we
did
was
present
the
one
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
we
are
not
arguing
that
jurisdictional
requirements
were
exceeded
in
this
case
in
any
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
is
none
in
this
record
your
honor.
the
50
states
have
submitted
plans
and
those
plans
were
disapproved
in
the
federal
register
in
so
far
as
they
do
not
comply
with
the
district
court’s
order
because
at
that
time
the
order
was
not
stayed.
this
court
granted
a
stay
later
in
the
context
of
a
situation
where
the
states
would
have
had
to
devote
resources
to
implementing
the
district
court’s
order
rather
than
to
implementing
the
rest
of
the
plans,
which
are
in
effect
and
were
approved
by
the
administrator.
so
the
plans
are
presently
in
effect
except
in
so
far
as
this
other
question
is
before
the
court
and
the
administrator
has
not
promulgated
any
substitute
provisions
requiring
the
states
to
devote
their
enforcement
resources
to
assuring
that
there
won’t
be
deterioration
of
the
area
in
any
portion
of
any
state.
now,
the
obvious
purpose
of
this
provision
c
was
to
permit
the
states
to
regulate
fuels
or
fuel
additives
when
they
had
to
do
so
in
order
to
comply
with
what
the
federal
act
requires
of
them
in
their
implementation
plans.
but
they
aren’t
allowed
to
do
so
in
order
to
effectuate
anything
additional
in
their
implementation
plans
that
they
may
have
put
in
of
their
own
volition.
it’s
hard
to
believe
that
it
would
have
been
drafted
this
way
if
that
wasn’t
of
the
frame
of
the
reference
that
the
drafters
had
in
mind.
the
entire
act
is
of
one
consistent
piece
and
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
the
provision
at
the
beginning
of
the
act,
stating
the
purposes
of
the
act,
which
was
carried
over
from
the
much
weaker
1967
act
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
operative
provisions
and
so
are
the
administrator’s
regulations.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
stated
that
under
our
interpretation
of
the
act
there
would
be
a
massive
increase
in
pollution
across
the
country.
we
disagree
with
that
but
there
is
no
factual
record
in
this
case
on
that
subject
and
even
if
that
were
true
i
do
not
think
that
gets
as
much
insight
into
the
significance
of
the
protect
and
enhance
language
which
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
act
in
section
101
since
that
language
was
carried
over
verbatim
from
the
much
weaker
provisions
of
the
1967
act
which
did
not
provide
for
federal
standard
of
emissions
at
all
from
point
of
sources
or
for
a
federal
standard
of
ambient
air
quality
which
had
no
application
to
areas
of
the
country
where
there
was
not
a
public
health
or
welfare
problem
such
as
that
it
is
now
covered
by
primary
and
secondary
standards
which
had
no
provisions
about
fuel
and
fuel
additives,
no
provision
limiting
aircraft,
weaker
provisions
with
respect
to
motor
vehicles.
now
the
significance
of
some
of
the
testimony
about
that
language,
i
think
can
only
be
appreciated
in
the
context
of
the
1967
act
which
was
the
basis
of
interpretations
that
secretaries
benjamin
and
finch
and
others
at
hew
had
developed
as
of
the
significance
of
this
provision
in
the
beginning.
the
1967
act
required
the
states
to
develop
their
own
standards
to
the
applicable
only
an
areas
where
there
were
significant
health
or
welfare
problems.
there
was
nothing
in
telling
the
states
what
those
standards
should
be.
and
hew
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
because
the
stated
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
protect
and
enhance
the
environment
and
it
was
to
apply
on
these
problem
areas
that
the
state
standards
to
be
develop
by
the
states
under
those
provisions
should
not
allow
significant
deterioration
of
the
air
quality
in
those
problem
areas.
the
standards
under
the
1970
act
has
specified
this
primary
and
secondary
standards
which
provide
in
detail
the
protection
of
health
and
welfare
that
was
the
concern
of
hew
in
stating
that
those
state
standards
develop
under
the
1967
act
should
not
allow
for
deterioration
that’s
going
to
cause
health
or
welfare
problems.
there
is
no
weakening
in
the
1970
act.
the
1970
act
spells
all
of
these
out
in
detail
and
prevents
the
states
from
allowing
deterioration
that
will
in
anyway
cause
any
known
or
anticipated
effect,
adverse
effect
on
health,
on
vegetation,
and
on
any
of
the
broadly
defined
protections
of
the
1970
act.
it
goes
much
further
than
the
1967
act
does.
there
was
admittedly
some
confusion
in
the
testimony
because
of
this
other
habit
of
mind
of
thinking
what
significance
the
provision
could
have.
so
when
you
look
at
the
provision
on
the
face
of
the
act
in
itself
that
requires
nothing.
it
merely
states
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
there
is
nothing
to
which
the
respondents
can
point
in
the
entire
act
to
which
this
can
meaningfully
applied
because
every
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
did
not
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
did
not
change
his
mind.
i
would
like
to
explain
that
on
the
basis
of
these
regulations
just
as
soon
as
i
finished
making
this
one
point
that
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
operative
provisions
of
the
act
that
can
be
interpreted
in
light
of
this
statement
which
in
itself
requires
nothing
to
add
a
requirement
to
the
states
because
every
place
in
the
act
that
it
says
at
the
states
must
submit
a
plan
it
has
a
plan
to
implement,
there
is
a
primary
and
secondary
standards.
there
is
no
general
requirement
of
a
state
plan
other
than
the
plan
for
that
purpose
and
section
110
specifies
in
great
detail
exactly
what
is
required
in
the
plan
that
the
administrator
shall
approve
the
plan
if
it
meets
those
requirements.
now,
the
provisions
that
have
been
adopted
in
these
regulations
were
adopted
in
two
separate
parts
which
i
distributed
to
the
court.
it’s
the
part
that
was
adopted
in
august
is
the
part
that
purports
to
specify
what
the
plans
submitted
by
the
states
have
to
include
and
it
is
undisputed
that
that
part
does
not
include
any
requirements
against
significant
deterioration.
the
part
of
this
issue
distributed
in
april
of
1930
was
not
on
the
subject
of
the
plans.
that
was
where
the
national
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
qualities
standards
were
adopted
and
the
great
bulk
of
these
regulations
concern
the
national
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standards.
there
is
at
the
beginning
and
this
is
on
page
8187,
the
very
first
page
on
the
right
as
you
opened
up
a
little
scope
provision
section
410.2.
that
provision
in
parts
a
and
b
defines
what
these
primary
and
secondary
standards
are,
and
then
part
c
which
is
the
one
that’s
disputed
here
in
parts
d
were
intended
to
be
savings
provisions.
the
respondents
say
that
they
would
be
redundant
if
both
were
regarded
as
savings
provisions,
where
part
d
saves
to
the
states
the
right
to
include
in
their
plans
requirements
to
go
beyond
the
primary
and
secondary
standards.
and
part
c
saves
to
the
states
the
right
to
impose
requirements
in
any
manner
whether
in
their
plans
or
not
to
go
beyond
the
primary
and
secondary
requirements.
part
c
is
peculiarly
worded
in
light
of
this
legislative
background.
i
asked
the
environmental
protection
agency
why
this
peculiar
wording
should
have
been
used
in
the
savings
provision
and
they
told
me
that
it
was
put
in
as
an
accommodation
to
the
environmental
groups
because
it
was
known
that
the
environmental
groups
were
like
to
try
to
persuade
the
states
to
adopt
requirements
against
any
significant
deterioration.
and
they
wanted
to
make
clear
that
the
national
primary
and
secondary
standards
were
not
to
have
the
effect
of
authorizing
any
significant
deterioration
if
the
states
chose
to
forbid
it.
that
is
the
reason
why
this
peculiar
language
was
used
in
the
savings
provision.
these
regulations
are
not
bout
what
the
state
plans
have
to
include
they
are
about
the
standards
that
were
being
promulgated
as
primary
and
secondary
standards
with
no
inconsistency.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
under
the
federal
clean
air
act
amendments
of
1970.
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
i’ve
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
to
each
member
of
the
court
a
pamphlet
containing
the
full
provisions
of
the
clean
air
act
as
amended
in
through
the
1970
amendments,
plus
two
excerpts
from
the
federal
register
reproducing
completely
the
parts
of
the
administrator’s
regulations
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
so
that
all
of
these
provisions
can
be
seen
in
full
context.
the
1970
amendments
greatly
strengthened
the
act
in
a
number
of
ways
and
among
other
things,
the
amendments
for
the
first
time
provided
for
federally
prescribed
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
for
federal
standards
before
emissions
from
new
stationary
sources
of
pollutants.
the
ambient
air
quality
standards
apply
to
the
presence
of
pollutants
in
the
overall
air
in
a
community
or
region
covered
by
the
standards
and
the
emission
standards
also
referred
to
as
performance
standards
in
the
act
apply
to
the
emissions
of
pollutants
from
a
single
point
source.
under
the
1970
amendments,
each
state
is
required
to
submit
a
plan
for
implementing
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
those
plans
also
have
to
prevent
deterioration
of
existing
air
quality
in
any
portion
of
any
state.
the
administrator
has
taken
the
position
of
the
act
does
not
require
or
permit
him
to
require
the
states
to
include
such
a
non-deterioration
provision
in
their
plans
although
it
preserves
the
right
of
the
states
to
do
so
if
they
wish.
respondents
brought
this
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
the
contrary
of
the
administrator’s
position
and
to
direct
the
administrator
to
disapprove
the
state
plans
that
have
been
submitted
in
so
far
as
they
do
not
prevent
significant
deterioration
of
existing
air
quality
in
any
part
of
any
state.
the
district
court
upheld
the
claim
of
the
respondents
on
the
basis
of
the
act’s
statement
of
purposes
and
on
the
basis
of
the
court’s
view
of
the
ex-legislative
history
and
what
the
court
regarded
as
inconsistency
in
the
administrator’s
regulations.
it
issued
a
preliminary
injunction,
which
the
parties
agreed
to
treat
as
a
final
order
for
purposes
of
appeal
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
district
court’s
opinion.
this
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
government’s
application
for
a
stay
pending
its
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
parties
agreed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
parties
agreed
that
it
involved
the
controlling
issue
of
law
that
settled
the
rights
between
the
parties.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
not
your
honor
because
what
this
court
is
reviewing
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
basis
of
the
district’s
court’s
opinion
as
to
the
legal
issues
but
on
the
basis
of
the
submission
of
parties
that
this
was
the
controlling
legal
issue
that
would
govern
the
practice
of
the
administrator
and
whether
the
administrator
could
approve
or
disapprove
the
state
plans
that
are
pending
before
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
the
rationale
of
the
district
court’s
memorandum
opinion
is
not
based
on
probabilities
at
all.
it’s
based
on
the
controlling
legal
issues
that
interprets
the
statute
and
in
effect
invalidates
the
administrator’s
regulations.
there
is
nothing
in
that
opinion
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
it’s
based
on
probabilities
or
preliminary
concerns
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
court
said
initially
this
matter
came
before
the
court
in
that
posture.
but
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
was
not
intended
as
just
for
the
part
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
an
injunction
is
appealable
so
long
as
it
then
joins
the
enforcement
of
a
federal
statute.
a
temporary
restraining
order
would
not
have
been
appealable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
terms
of
the
stipulation,
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
pointed
out
plus
the
chronological
situation.
the
preliminary
injunction
was
issued
by
the
district
court
the
day
before
the
final
day
under
the
statute
when
the
administrator
had
to
approve
or
disapprove
all
of
these
data
implementation
plans.
the
suit
was
brought
one
week
before
the
statutory
deadline.
the
district
court
ahead
to
act
rapidly
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
regarded
this
as
a
matter
for
rapid
disposition
because
the
statutes
specifies
this
very
tight
deadlines
for
implementation
of
the
act.
and
that
is
the
question
that
has
been
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here.
the
governing
legal
question
which
both
parties
understood
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
deciding
on
the
basis
of
this
stipulation.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
anything
else.
ordinarily,
one
would
think
that
they
were
rejecting
the
stipulated
legal
issue
that
was
before
them
and
deciding
something
else,
they
would
have
said
so.
the
parties
agreed
what
the
legal
issue
was
and
we
think
that
that
issue
was
the
question
that
is
now
presented
in
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
--
and
its
answer
was
based
on
what
the
parties
regarded
as
the
governing
legal
question.
that’s
the
question
we
presented
in
our
petition
and
the
question
to
which
i
would
like
to
devote
the
remainder
of
my
argument
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
not
the
issue
that
the
parties
stipulated
where
it
was
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals.
and
one
presumes
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
stipulated
issue
that
the
parties
said
it
was
deciding,
it
would
have
indicated
as
much
and
even
if
the
case
has
to
be
regarded
as
limited
in
its
posture
to
whether
there
was
an
abusive
discretion
with
respect
to
the
preliminary
injunction,
our
position
is
that
the
legal
issue
is
a
clear
one
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
that
this
court
should
decide
it.
in
that
context,
if
it
regards,
it
is
presented
in
this
context,
which
we
don’t
regard
as
the
context
in
which
it
is
presented.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
not
regarded
as
a
shortcut
at
all.
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
expectation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
without
any
opinion
of
their
own.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it
was
not
mandatory
for
this
court
to
grant
certiorari.
we
petitioned
and
we
presented
the
governing
legal
question
as
the
question
presented
in
the
petition.
we
think
that
question
is
here
in
either
context.
now
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
evaluating
the
probability
of
success
of
the
legal
issues
does
not
discuss
any
of
the
operative
provisions
of
the
act.
although
in
our
view,
congress
in
these
provisions
answered
with
complete
clarity
and
with
great
specificity
the
underlying
legal
question
that’s
before
this
court
and
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
these
operative
provisions
of
the
act.
in
the
pamphlet
that’s
been
passed
out
to
the
justices.
the
structure
of
the
act
relevant
here
begins
with
section
108
on
page
9
of
this
pamphlet
which
specifies
that,
“the
administrator
is
to
adopt
criteria
for
each
of
the
individual
pollutants
to
be
found
in
the
ambient
air”
and
the
administrator
has
done
so
with
respect
to
all
of
the
common
pollutants
whether
additional
ones
will
be
added
remains
subject
to
continuing
review.
then
section
109
on
page
10
specifies,
“that
the
administrator
on
the
basis
of
these
criteria
for
individual
pollutants
then
will
adopt
what
are
called
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards.”
two
standards
are
to
be
adopted
by
the
administrator
and
have
been
adopted
by
the
administrator.
our
national
primary
ambient
air
quality
standard
defined
as
standard
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health
and
the
national
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standard
defined
at
the
top
of
page
11
as
requisite
to
protect
the
public
welfare
from
any
known
or
anticipated
adverse
effects.
and
public
welfare
is
very
broadly
defined
on
page
48
of
this
pamphlet
in
the
act.
section
300
2
(h)
which
says,
“that
all
language
referring
to
effects
on
welfare
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
effects
on
soils,
water,
crops,
vegetation,
man-made
materials,
animals,
wildlife,
weather,
visibility
and
climate
damage
to,
and
deterioration
of
property
and
hazards
to
transportation
as
well
as
effects
on
economic
values
and
on
personal
comfort
and
well-being.”
these
standards
are
very
far
reaching
and
have
been
adopted.
they
are
not
subject
to
collateral
review
in
this
case
for
reasons
explained
in
our
brief.
there
is
a
statutory
provision
specifying
another
word
for
review
of
the
standards.
so
this
case
was
decided
and
should
be
decided
on
the
premise
that
the
standards
adopted
by
the
administrator
are
fully
adequate
to
prevent
in
the
ambient
air
any
known
or
anticipated
adverse
effects
on
health,
vegetation,
and
all
of
the
other
factors
covered
in
the
statute.
the
standards
themselves
are
subject
to
continuous
review
and
revision
by
the
administrator
as
additional
scientific
information
becomes
available.
but
these
are
stringent
standards.
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
of
the
view
that
many
urban
areas
will
have
extreme
difficulty
conforming
even
to
the
primary
standard
and
even
greater
difficulty
conforming
to
the
secondary
standard.
now,
the
key
provision
for
purposes
of
this
case
is
section
110
entitled
implementation
plans.
and
that
title
is
in
the
public
law
in
the
statute’s
at
large
all
of
these
titles
are
and
that
section
requires
each
stay
to
adopt
and
submit
a
plan
providing
for
the
implementation
maintenance
enforcement
of
the
primary
standard
and
a
plan
providing
for
implementation
maintenance
enforcement
and
enforcement
of
the
secondary
standard.
that’s
all
in
a
110
(a)
(1)
and
then
110
(a)
(2)
specifies
that
the
administrator
shall,
the
second
sentence
of
that,
shall
approve
such
plan
submitted
to
him
or
any
portion
thereof.
if
he
determines
that
it
was
adopted
after
reasonable
notice
and
hearing
and
that,
and
then
they
are
listed
a
through
h.
eight
additional
requirements
that
the
plan
must
meet
and
if
it
meets
those
eight
requirements
and
it
was
adopted
after
reasonable
notice
and
hearing,
the
act
says
on
its
face
the
administrator
shall
approve
it.
it
is
undisputed
that
none
of
these
eight
requirements
are
--
adds
a
requirement
that
the
plan
provide
against
significant
deterioration
of
existing
air
quality
other
than
the
requirement
that
the
primary
and
secondary
standards
be
met,
which
is
part
a.
the
others
are
all
concerned
with
different
subject
matter
and
are
tied
in
with
meeting
the
primary
and
secondary
standards.
now
we
think
it
is
significant
that
this
provision
does
not
even
say
the
administrator
shall
not
approve
such
plan
unless
it
meets
these
criteria.
it
speaks
in
the
positive
in
the
mandatory
sense
he
shall
approve
but
if
it
does
meet
these
standards.
it
has
long
been
the
view
of
the
agency
of
that
if
a
plan
were
submitted
by
a
state,
which
admittedly
met
all
the
standards
and
yet
disapproved
it;
it
would
have
a
very
week
position
in
court
if
sued
by
that
state.
and
it
did
not
think
it
could
prevail
in
such
a
suit
and
of
course
the
case
did
not
arise
in
that
context.
now
in
addition
to,
i
might
add
that
there
are
other
portions
of
section
110,
which
reaffirm
that
the
plans
or
implementation
plans
for
these
federally
prescribed
standards.
i
refer
the
court
in
particular
to
subpart
h
there
in
this
list
of
eight
requirements,
which
says
that
the
plan
must
provide
for
revision
and
number
2,
whenever
the
administrator
finds
on
the
basis
of
information
available
to
him
that
the
plan
is
substantially
inadequate
to
achieve
the
national
ambient
air
quality
primary
or
secondary
standard.
not
that’s
inadequate
for
some
other
purpose.
the
only
definition
of
the
plan
in
the
act
is
subpart
d
on
page
13
in
section
110,
which
says,
“for
purposes
of
this
act
an
applicable
implementation
plan
is
the
implementation
plan
which
has
been
approved
under
subsection
(a)
are
promulgated
by
the
administrator
under
subsection
(c)
in
which
implements
the
national
primary
or
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standard
in
the
state.”
the
act
provides
for
an
additional
requirement
and
that
is
the
section
111
requirement
on
performance
standards
for
new
stationary
sources.
this
is
a
part
from
the
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
quality
requirements
and
i
won’t
have
time
to
go
into
that
in
any
detail.
but
it
is
significant
that
the
act
defines
standard
of
performance
to
mean
at
the
beginning
of
section
111,
“a
standard
for
emissions
of
air
pollutants,
which
reflects
the
degree
of
emission
limitation
achievable
through
the
application
of
the
best
system
of
emission
reduction
which
taking
into
account
the
cost
of
achieving
such
reduction.
the
administrator
determines
has
been
adequately
demonstrated.”
now,
all
of
this
indicates
that
there
are
two
requirements
being
imposed
by
the
act.
one
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
the
other,
emission
limitation
requirements,
which
not
preclude
new
development
that
which
impose
a
practical
best
available
limitation
taking
cost
into
account
as
a
protection
that
applies
as
well
to
areas
where
the
existing
air
quality
exceeds
that
of
the
primary
and
secondary
standards.
and
then
section
116
of
the
act
specifies
that
the
states
are
free
to
adopt
more
stringent
standards
for
the
ambient
air
if
they
care
to
do
so.
and
this
is
in
keeping
with
the
finding
recited
in
section
101
(a)
(3)
of
the
act
that
the
prevention
in
control
of
air
pollution
at
its
source
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
states
and
local
governments.
now
this
interpretation
of
the
act
is
also
corroborated
by
other
in
court
into
provisions
of
the
act.
the
entire
structure
of
the
act
looks
toward
these
implementation
plans
as
being
just
what
they
are
called
plans
to
implement
the
primary
and
secondary
standards.
section
107
(a)
of
the
act
on
page
8
succinctly
spells
out
what
the
states
responsibility
is
and
again
it’s
just
have
been
an
implementation
plan
for
such
state
which
will
specify
the
manner
in
which
national
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standards
will
be
achieved
in
and
maintained.
and
then
one
of
the
most
persuasive
provisions
further
corroborating
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
the
entire
scheme
of
it
is
to
be
found
on
page
41
of
the
pamphlet
of
the
act
and
that
is
section
211
(c)
(4)
(c),
the
capital
c
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page
on
page
41.
i
apologize
that
this
was
a
mistakenly
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief
as
section
210.
it
is
actually
section
211.
subpart
4
basically,
preempts
the
states
from
regulating
fuels
or
fuel
additives.
but
this
subpart
capital
c
says
that
the
administrator
may
however
approve
a
provision
regulating
fuels
or
fuel
additives
and
implementation
plans
or
promulgate
an
implementation
plan
containing
such
a
provision
but
only
if
he
finds
that
the
state
control
or
prohibition
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
national
primary
or
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standard,
which
the
plan
implements.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
50
plans
have
been
submitted
to
the
administrator.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
disapproved
them
in
so
far
as
they
do
not
comply
with
the
district
court’s
order
in
this
case.
but
they
don’t
contain
any
enforcement
mechanism
consistent
with
the
district
court’s
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
that
we’ve
dropped
that
contention
in
this
court.
all
we
did
was
present
the
one
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
we
are
not
arguing
that
jurisdictional
requirements
were
exceeded
in
this
case
in
any
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
is
none
in
this
record
your
honor.
the
50
states
have
submitted
plans
and
those
plans
were
disapproved
in
the
federal
register
in
so
far
as
they
do
not
comply
with
the
district
court’s
order
because
at
that
time
the
order
was
not
stayed.
this
court
granted
a
stay
later
in
the
context
of
a
situation
where
the
states
would
have
had
to
devote
resources
to
implementing
the
district
court’s
order
rather
than
to
implementing
the
rest
of
the
plans,
which
are
in
effect
and
were
approved
by
the
administrator.
so
the
plans
are
presently
in
effect
except
in
so
far
as
this
other
question
is
before
the
court
and
the
administrator
has
not
promulgated
any
substitute
provisions
requiring
the
states
to
devote
their
enforcement
resources
to
assuring
that
there
won’t
be
deterioration
of
the
area
in
any
portion
of
any
state.
now,
the
obvious
purpose
of
this
provision
c
was
to
permit
the
states
to
regulate
fuels
or
fuel
additives
when
they
had
to
do
so
in
order
to
comply
with
what
the
federal
act
requires
of
them
in
their
implementation
plans.
but
they
aren’t
allowed
to
do
so
in
order
to
effectuate
anything
additional
in
their
implementation
plans
that
they
may
have
put
in
of
their
own
volition.
it’s
hard
to
believe
that
it
would
have
been
drafted
this
way
if
that
wasn’t
of
the
frame
of
the
reference
that
the
drafters
had
in
mind.
the
entire
act
is
of
one
consistent
piece
and
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
the
provision
at
the
beginning
of
the
act,
stating
the
purposes
of
the
act,
which
was
carried
over
from
the
much
weaker
1967
act
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
operative
provisions
and
so
are
the
administrator’s
regulations.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
stated
that
under
our
interpretation
of
the
act
there
would
be
a
massive
increase
in
pollution
across
the
country.
we
disagree
with
that
but
there
is
no
factual
record
in
this
case
on
that
subject
and
even
if
that
were
true
i
do
not
think
that
gets
as
much
insight
into
the
significance
of
the
protect
and
enhance
language
which
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
act
in
section
101
since
that
language
was
carried
over
verbatim
from
the
much
weaker
provisions
of
the
1967
act
which
did
not
provide
for
federal
standard
of
emissions
at
all
from
point
of
sources
or
for
a
federal
standard
of
ambient
air
quality
which
had
no
application
to
areas
of
the
country
where
there
was
not
a
public
health
or
welfare
problem
such
as
that
it
is
now
covered
by
primary
and
secondary
standards
which
had
no
provisions
about
fuel
and
fuel
additives,
no
provision
limiting
aircraft,
weaker
provisions
with
respect
to
motor
vehicles.
now
the
significance
of
some
of
the
testimony
about
that
language,
i
think
can
only
be
appreciated
in
the
context
of
the
1967
act
which
was
the
basis
of
interpretations
that
secretaries
benjamin
and
finch
and
others
at
hew
had
developed
as
of
the
significance
of
this
provision
in
the
beginning.
the
1967
act
required
the
states
to
develop
their
own
standards
to
the
applicable
only
an
areas
where
there
were
significant
health
or
welfare
problems.
there
was
nothing
in
telling
the
states
what
those
standards
should
be.
and
hew
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
because
the
stated
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
protect
and
enhance
the
environment
and
it
was
to
apply
on
these
problem
areas
that
the
state
standards
to
be
develop
by
the
states
under
those
provisions
should
not
allow
significant
deterioration
of
the
air
quality
in
those
problem
areas.
the
standards
under
the
1970
act
has
specified
this
primary
and
secondary
standards
which
provide
in
detail
the
protection
of
health
and
welfare
that
was
the
concern
of
hew
in
stating
that
those
state
standards
develop
under
the
1967
act
should
not
allow
for
deterioration
that’s
going
to
cause
health
or
welfare
problems.
there
is
no
weakening
in
the
1970
act.
the
1970
act
spells
all
of
these
out
in
detail
and
prevents
the
states
from
allowing
deterioration
that
will
in
anyway
cause
any
known
or
anticipated
effect,
adverse
effect
on
health,
on
vegetation,
and
on
any
of
the
broadly
defined
protections
of
the
1970
act.
it
goes
much
further
than
the
1967
act
does.
there
was
admittedly
some
confusion
in
the
testimony
because
of
this
other
habit
of
mind
of
thinking
what
significance
the
provision
could
have.
so
when
you
look
at
the
provision
on
the
face
of
the
act
in
itself
that
requires
nothing.
it
merely
states
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
there
is
nothing
to
which
the
respondents
can
point
in
the
entire
act
to
which
this
can
meaningfully
applied
because
every
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
did
not
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
did
not
change
his
mind.
i
would
like
to
explain
that
on
the
basis
of
these
regulations
just
as
soon
as
i
finished
making
this
one
point
that
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
operative
provisions
of
the
act
that
can
be
interpreted
in
light
of
this
statement
which
in
itself
requires
nothing
to
add
a
requirement
to
the
states
because
every
place
in
the
act
that
it
says
at
the
states
must
submit
a
plan
it
has
a
plan
to
implement,
there
is
a
primary
and
secondary
standards.
there
is
no
general
requirement
of
a
state
plan
other
than
the
plan
for
that
purpose
and
section
110
specifies
in
great
detail
exactly
what
is
required
in
the
plan
that
the
administrator
shall
approve
the
plan
if
it
meets
those
requirements.
now,
the
provisions
that
have
been
adopted
in
these
regulations
were
adopted
in
two
separate
parts
which
i
distributed
to
the
court.
it’s
the
part
that
was
adopted
in
august
is
the
part
that
purports
to
specify
what
the
plans
submitted
by
the
states
have
to
include
and
it
is
undisputed
that
that
part
does
not
include
any
requirements
against
significant
deterioration.
the
part
of
this
issue
distributed
in
april
of
1930
was
not
on
the
subject
of
the
plans.
that
was
where
the
national
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
qualities
standards
were
adopted
and
the
great
bulk
of
these
regulations
concern
the
national
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standards.
there
is
at
the
beginning
and
this
is
on
page
8187,
the
very
first
page
on
the
right
as
you
opened
up
a
little
scope
provision
section
410.2.
that
provision
in
parts
a
and
b
defines
what
these
primary
and
secondary
standards
are,
and
then
part
c
which
is
the
one
that’s
disputed
here
in
parts
d
were
intended
to
be
savings
provisions.
the
respondents
say
that
they
would
be
redundant
if
both
were
regarded
as
savings
provisions,
where
part
d
saves
to
the
states
the
right
to
include
in
their
plans
requirements
to
go
beyond
the
primary
and
secondary
standards.
and
part
c
saves
to
the
states
the
right
to
impose
requirements
in

part
c
is
peculiarly
worded
in

legislative
background.
i
asked
the
environmental
protection
agency
why
this
peculiar
wording
should
have
been
used
in
the
savings
provision
and
they
told
me
that
it
was
put
in
as
an
accommodation
to
the
environmental
groups
because
it
was
known
that
the
environmental
groups
were
like
to
try
to
persuade
the
states
to
adopt
requirements
against
any
significant
deterioration.
and
they
wanted
to
make
clear
that
the
national
primary
and
secondary
standards
were
not
to
have
the
effect
of
authorizing
any
significant
deterioration
if
the
states
chose
to
forbid
it.
that
is
the
reason
why
this
peculiar
language
was
used
in
the
savings
provision.
these
regulations
are
not
bout
what
the
state
plans
have
to
include
they
are
about
the
standards
that
were
being
promulgated
as
primary
and
secondary
standards
with
no
inconsistency.

you,
your
honor.
