justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
i
don’t
mean
to
interrupt.
you
have
a
question
if
you
are
answering
either
the
chief
justice
or
justice
stewart’s
question.
i
mentioned
the
stipulation
on
page
37
of
the
record,
which
i
don’t
read
quite
the
same
the
way
justice
stewart
did.
if
you
turn
--
if
you
look
at
the
first
paragraph
on
page
37
of
the
appendix,
it
is
hereby
stipulated
by
and
between
the
parties
to
this
appeal,
the
decisions
of
the
district
court
in
regard
is
a
final
rather
interlocutory
order
on
the
merits.
and
then
it
sets
forth
the
reasons
for
doing
so.
that
strikes
me
as
the
kind
of
stipulation
that
counsel
are
not
unknown
to
anyone
and
when
they
feel
that
the
thing
is
--
can’t
possibly
come
out
any
different
way
on
the
final
area
and
they
simply
waive
their
right
to
a
final
hearing
in
the
district
court.
i
don’t
read
that
as
a
stipulation
just
for
the
purposes
of
an
appeal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it’s
not
the
way
the
district
court
put
it.
i
don’t
want
to
repeat
myself
but
it
said
is
there
a
probability
of
success?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
certainly,
the
government’s
application
for
a
stay
refers
to
what
is
worth
to
a
final
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
application
not
only
to
the
district
court
but
i
take
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
terris,
what
is
the
interest
of
the
states
precisely
we
are
submitting
these
amicus
briefs.
i
would
think
that
if
a
state
attorney
general
thought
his
state
should
have
a
stronger
policy,
he
could
can
simply
go
to
a
state
and
not
have
to
come
here
and
urge
that
there
is
federal
preemption
of
the
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
kind
of
put
--
that
isn’t
language
out
of
the
statute
though,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
that
isn’t
the
language
out
of
the
statute.
you
suggest
that
government
doesn’t
allude
to
the
legislative
history.
i
trust
you
will
allude
to
the
statute
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that’s
5112
(b)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
relied
just
the
(inaudible)?
i
mean
that’s
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
terris,
in
--
you
refer
to
section
1857
and
is
--
you
rely
on
anything
more
of
the
statute
other
than
those
four
lines
that
you
set
forth
on
page
2
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
-
of
your
brief
that
the
protect
and
enhance
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
terris,
is
there
any
possibility
here
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
situation
where
the
statute
along
with
the
language
that
you
rely
in
could
have
permitted
the
administrative
to
go
either
way
on
anything.
that
if
the
language
you
rely
on
would
have
supported
what
you
claim
is
now
required
to
do
but
it
wouldn’t
require?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
can
be
an
administrative
determination
and
he
may
be
supported
if
he
makes
that
conclusion
administratively
but
not
required
to
do
it
is
a
matter
of
statute.
