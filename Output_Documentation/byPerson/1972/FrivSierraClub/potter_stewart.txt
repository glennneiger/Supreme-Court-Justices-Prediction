mr.
wallace,
what
you
just
said
is
something
that’s
i’ve
been
wondering
about
in
this
case.
all
that
was
issued
was
a
preliminary
injunction
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
parties
agreed
to
consider
it
something
else
for
a
limited
purpose
i.e.
for
the
purposes
of
appeal.
but
all
of
the
district
court
that
ever
issued
was
a
preliminary
injunction,
am
i
--?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
all
that
ever
has
happen
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
for
purposes
that
appear
to
the
court
of
appeals,
then
really
isn’t
the
only
–
isn’t
the
frame
of
the
issues
here
whether
or
not
the
court
was
right
in
issuing
a
preliminary
injunction
not
whether
or
not
it
was
right
or
wrong
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
which
in
our
opinions
simply
affirm
the
preliminary
injunction
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
preliminary
injunction
is
issued
generally
as
we
all
know
on
matters
and
questions
of
probabilities
and
possibilities,
threats
of
harm
and
how
immediate
and
irreparable
they
are
and
what
not
without
getting
to
a
definitive
decision
of
underlying
merits
and
that’s
all
what
was
done
here,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
say
first
--
first
the
plaintiffs
made
a
strong
showing
that
they
are
likely
to
prevail
on
the
merits.
now
that’s
and
the
answer
is
they
said
yes,
but
that
is
not
deciding
the
merit.
justice
potter
stewart
there
couldn’t
have
been
an
appeal,
could
they
or
am
i
mistaken
if
it
were
an
interlocutory
injunction
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
preliminary
injunction.
