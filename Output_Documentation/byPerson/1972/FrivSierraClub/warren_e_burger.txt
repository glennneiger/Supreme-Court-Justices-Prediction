didn’t
they?

but
mr.
wallace
pardon
me,
having
in
mind
that
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
no
opinion
but
merely
acted
on
the
district
court’s
memorandum,
which
i
might
say
parenthetically
they
don’t
very
often
do
in
an
important
case.
can
you
point
to
anything
in
a
record
here,
which
indicates
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
aware
that
this
was
being
treated
as
a
permanent
disposition,
a
total
disposition
of
the
case?
would
you
point
to
that
for
me?

would
you
have
a
chance
of
success
for
my
satisfaction
that
the
court

did
anything
more
as
mr.
justice
sturgis
intimated
then
say
that
in
the
particular
circumstances,
the
action
of
the
district
court
was
not
an
abusive
discretion
as
distinguished
from
whether
it
was
right

wrong
on
the
ultimate
legal
issue?

what
you
are
saying

that

not
a
respect

your

now,
that
hasn’t
really
helped
us
much
more
than
calling

calling
an

act,
does
it?
chief

mr.

suppose
instead
of
a
statement
of
mr.
benjamin’s
that
you
rely
on
is
giving
some
added
force
here
it
was
a
statement
in
the

report

you

what
you
have
responded

require
a

with
something
contrary
to
mr.

well,
what
would
that
produce?

get
how
