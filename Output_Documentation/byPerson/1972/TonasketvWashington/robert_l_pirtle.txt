mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
robert
pirtle,
attorney
for
the
appellant
in
this
case.
this
case
comes
to
court
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
part
of
the
jurisdiction
was
noted
on
june
12,
1972.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
although
complicated
somewhat
by
later
enacted
legislation
both
by
the
state
of
washington,
the
colville
confederated
tribes
and
by
later
activities
of
the
state
and
the
appellant
and
the
tribes
and
the
federal
government.
we’ll
begin
here
with
the
thorough
recognition
that
washington
is
public
law
83-280
state.
that
is
pursuant
to
that
act,
it
has
taken
jurisdiction,
certain
jurisdiction
over
indians
and
indian
reservations.
the
reservation
here
is
the
colville
reservation
in
eastern
washington
comprising
some
1.3
million
acres.
it
is
governed
by
a
14-member
tribal
council
under
a
constitution
of
by-laws
approved
by
the
federal
government.
leonard
tonasket,
the
appellant
here
is
a
full-blood
indian.
he
is
a
direct
descendant
of
chief
tonasket
of
the
okanogan
band.
in
1964,
he
borrowed
some
$6,000
of
federally
restricted
funds
with
which
to
build
a
store
on
his
trust
allotment
inside
the
reservation.
that
land
was
specifically
approved
by
the
federal
government.
he
made
and
additional
loan
of
$800
to
with
which
to
purchase
cigarette
inventory.
that
loan
was
also
a
federally
restricted
funds
again
approved
by
the
federal
government.
he
operated
his
store
selling
cigarettes
and
sundries
and
indian
artifacts
and
clothing
as
a
trader
on
the
reservation
but
without
a
federal
trader’s
license.
he
did
not
collect
tax
for
the
state
of
washington
nor
for
the
tribe
at
that
time.
the
state
of
washington
arrested
him
in
1967
and
seized
his
cigarette
inventory
leaving
the
rest
of
his
inventory
intact.
he
then
began
this
action
inequity
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
his
rights
to
make
sales
in
the
reservation
on
his
trust
land.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
can
clarify
that
for
you,
your
honor.
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
that
public
law
83-280
specifically
granted
the
state
complete
jurisdiction
over
indian
trading
with
no
exceptions.
now,
the
state
of
washington
in
its
briefs
in
this
case
is
willing
to
concede
that
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction
over
trade
with
respect
to
indians.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
but
that’s
not
what
the
decision
says.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
can
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
it
is.
that’s
clearly
indian
commerce
within
the
federal
constitutional
definition,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
sales
from
the
indian
to
the
non-indian
on
the
reservation
also
come
within
that
definition.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
true.
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
your
honor,
i
did
not
try
this
case
in
the
superior
court,
so
i’m
somewhat
at
a
disadvantage
in
that
respect.
i
can
assure
you
that
i
would’ve
raised
the
question.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
superior
court
nor
argued
in
the
supreme
court.
but
it
is
a
viable
question
as
pointed
out
in
that
brief
and
it
will
be
raised
in
the
future.
the
court
would
want
to
consider
it.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
now,
i
believe
the
argument
was
made
with
respect
to
the
two
kinds
of
sales
but
the
supreme
court
decided
to
go
all
the
way.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
that
280
is
in
fact
effective
in
the
state,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
no,
we
have
to
distinguish
in
a
very
fine
way
here.
i
understood
the
previous
question
to
mean
is
public
law
83-280
actually
legally
approved
in
the
state
of
washington.
that
is
has
the
state
legally
accepted
jurisdiction?
that
is
the
contention
that
was
not
raised
below.
it
was
not
briefed
for
the
state
supreme
court
and
which
will
be
raised
in
the
later
case.
the
other
part
of
the
question
or
as
i
understand
it,
the
question
you’re
asking
now
is,
how
about
the
application
of
public
law
83-280
to
the
facts
of
this
case?
that
was
raised
in
expense
of
the
argument.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
it
was
your
honor.
yes.
and
extensively
argued.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
no,
the
amicus
brief
for
the
national
congress
of
american-indians
says,
“there
is
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
the
state
of
washington
has
complied
with
the
federal
requirements
and
assuming
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
public
law
83-280
and
the
court
should
recognize
that
fact
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
it
was
not
and
the
court
may
wish
to
remand
it
for
the
raising
and
briefing
of
that
issue,
your
honor,
especially
from
the
osburn,
say,
especially
in
the
light
of
the
new
legislative
history
concerning
public
law
83-280
which
has
just
been
uncovered
in
the
archives.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
well,
i
would
not
say
it
was
conceded,
your
honor.
it
was
not
raised
by
the
attorney
representing
the
appellant
below
and
i
was
not
in
the
position
to
raise
it
in
the
appellate
court
as
appellant
counsel.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
am
not
conceding
that
but
i’m
--
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
--
of
necessity
in
that
position.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
true.
now,
after
this
action
was
begun,
the
legislative
activity
which
i
referred
to
occurred.
washington
passed
a
new
act
concerning
the
regulation
of
cigarettes
in
1972.
that
act
specifically
authorized
any
citizen
of
the
state
of
washington
to
buy,
possess
and
use
two
cartons
of
tax-free
cigarettes
without
incurring
tax
liability.
--
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
two
cartons
per
person
at
any
one
given
time.
that
is
a
possession
matter.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
true.
and
the
oregon
tax
is
4
cents
which
is
13
cents
less
in
washington.
the
idaho
tax
is
7
cents
which
is
10
cents
less
and
many,
many
state
residents
have
been
going
back
and
forth
across
the
borders
bringing
cigarettes
in.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
act
in
1972.
towns
were
being
searched
and
the
housewives
of
the
important
people
on
the
state
were
very
angry.
although,
that’s
outside
the
record
but
it’s
well-known
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
after
the
act
which
governor
evans
characterized
as
legitimatizing
indian
sales
to
the
extent
of
two
cartons,
the
colville
confederated
tribes
enacted
the
colville
tobacco
ordinance
which
makes
the
handling
and
sale
of
all
cigarette
products
on
the
reservation
a
tribal
enterprise.
it
requires
that
the
outlets
be
licensed
by
the
tribe.
it
requires
that
the
operator
have
a
license
from
the
tribe,
that
the
operation
be
conducted
on
trust
land,
that
the
operator
have
a
federal
trader’s
license.
it
levies
a
tribal
tax
on
every
pack
of
cigarette
sold
on
the
reservation.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
he
does,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
the
record,
it’s
in
the
appendix.
it
was
not
in
the
case
below
but
of
course,
it
occurred
after
the
facts
of
this
case
happened.
he
has
a
license
from
the
tribe
and
from
the
federal
government
as
a
licensed
trader.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
no,
it
has
not,
your
honor.
it’s
still
on
his
trust
land
in
east
omak
which
is
an
indian
village.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
it
is.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
yes,
your
honor.
it’s
a
trust
allotment
under
the
general
allotment
act.
now,
the
law
which
applies
to
this
case
is
rather
not
preempting
but
the
central
issue
emerges
very
clearly.
that
is,
does
public
law
83-280
constitute
a
grant
of
tax
jurisdiction
to
the
state?
the
state
supreme
court
says,
“yes,
it
constitutes
a
plenary
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
indians
with
only
the
exception
set
forth
in
2
(b)
and
4
(b)
of
the
act.
the
court
went
further.
it
said
it
constitutes
a
complete
grant
to
the
state
of
indian
trading
jurisdiction.
now,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
examine
the
act.
putting
in
context,
in
1953,
congress
was
considering
a
number
of
major
cases
of
indian
legislation
following
four
or
five
separate
categories.
public
law
83-280
was
merely
one
piece.
it
had
a
narrow
legislative
purpose.
it
was
a
law
and
order
statute.
it
was
specifically
for
the
purpose
fulfilling
the
hiatus
in
law-enforcement
on
the
reservation
from
the
criminal
standpoint.
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
state
form
for
the
determination
of
civil
litigation
from
the
civil
standpoint.
and
if
you
examine
the
act,
the
language
of
the
act
from
page
a-10
of
brief,
you’ll
notice
that
it
says
that
the
jurisdiction
given
to
the
state
is
jurisdiction
over
civil
causes
of
action
and
it
provides
that
civil
laws
of
the
state
that
are
of
general
applicability
to
private
persons
or
private
property
shall
have
the
same
effect
on
indian
reservations.
now,
the
court
has
to
ask
itself,
is
that
language
of
plenary
grant
a
jurisdiction?
consider
it
was
respect
to
taxation.
it
says
nothing
about
taxation
but
when
congress
wants
state
taxes
to
apply
on
an
indian
reservation,
it
says
so
in
no
uncertain
terms.
look
at
the
claim
of
termination
act
on
page
27
of
the
brief.
it
provides
that
after
termination,
the
property
shall
be
subject
to
the
same
taxes,
state
and
federal,
as
in
the
case
of
non-indians.
look
at
menominee
termination
bill
on
page
30,
provides
that
all
statutes
of
the
united
states
which
affect
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians
shall
no
longer
be
applicable
and
it
provides
that
the
laws
of
the
state
shall
apply
to
the
tribe
and
its
members.
that
is
plenary
jurisdiction
grant
language.
now,
congress
has
made
one
general
act
with
respect
to
state
taxes
on
indian
reservations,
that’s
buck
act
which
you’ve
heard
referred
to
in
the
other
cases
today.
congress
said,
“states,
you
may
apply
your
taxes
in
federal
reservations
both
income,
use,
sales
but
you
may
not
apply
them
to
indian
reservations.”
that
has
never
changed.
frost
versus
wenie
says,
“acts
of
congress
will
not
be
deemed
repealed
by
implication.”
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
to
federal
reservations
but
not
indian
reservations.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
and
that’s
4
u.s.c.
109.
now,
when
congress
wants
state
tax
to
apply
on
an
indian
reservation,
it
says
it.
it
says
it
with
the
expressed
language.
it
provided
in
25
u.s.c.
section
398
that
minimal
interest
could
be
taxed.
it
provided
in
the
brown
stevens
bill,
public
law
291,
49
statute
65
that
taxation
could
apply
with
respect
to
one
state.
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
passed
public
law
83-280
and
it
said,
“now,
we’re
going
to
repeal
certain
statutes.
we’re
going
to
repeal
18
u.s.c.
section
1152.”
that
is
the
act
that
applies
the
federal
criminal
code
on
reservations.
it
repealed
it.
congress
said,
“we’re
going
to
repeal
18
u.s.c.
section
1153.
that
is
the
ten
major
crimes
act.
but
very
significantly,
your
honors,
congress
did
not
say,
“we’re
going
to
repeal
the
traders
act.”
congress
did
not
say,
“we’re
going
to
repeal
the
buck
act.”
congress
knew
what
it
was
repealing
and
what
it
was
not
repealing.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
especially
the
hearing
which
the
federal
government
just
find
on
archives,
the
hearing
of
the
subcommittee
of
june
29,
1953,
you’ll
find
the
tax
discussion
concerning
this
bill.
the
first
one
and
i’m
delighted
to
have
found
it
because
in
that,
mr.
soloway
who
was
chief
counsel
for
the
bia
discusses
the
question
of
subsidy
to
the
states
assuming
jurisdiction
under
this
act
and
the
congressmen
involved
are
congressmen
from
all
of
the
states
with
large
indian
populations
and
they
repeatedly
say,
“but
what
about
the
federal
subsidy?
who
will
pay
for
the
burden
on
the
court
system?
what
about
this
jurisdiction,
this
additional
law
and
order,
cost
to
the
states?”
and
mr.
soloway
says,
“the
government
feels
that
this
is
just
a
burden
the
states
have
got
to
assume
if
they
wanted.”
and
you
all
know
the
history
of
the
act.
some
states
refused
to
assume
that
burden
because
they
would
not
have
any
tax
money
to
pay
for
it
with.
this
is
the
point
in
the
dialogue
at
which
congress
if
it
had
ever
intended
it
would
have
said,
“congressmen,
you
may
now
have
your
states
tax
the
indians.
arizona,
you
can
tax
those
100,000
navajos
and
pay
for
this
jurisdiction
if
you
assume
it.
washington,
you
may
tax
those
26,000
indians
and
you
may
pay
for
this
jurisdiction
if
you
assume
it.”
congress
didn’t.
congress
left
the
buck
act
intact.
it
left
the
trader
statute
intact.
it
made
no
reference
to
the
taxation
and
public
law
83-280
in
terms
of
the
specific
grant
that
congress’
policy
dictates.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
uphold
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
case,
the
consequences
would
be
disastrous.
it
would
mean
an
impel
of
all
of
the
tax
immunities
of
indian
tribes
which
this
court
has
said
is
not
likely
to
be
attributed
to
congress
than
the
lone
wolf
and
hitchcock
case.
it
would
be
the
rejection
of
the
expressed
language
requirement
which
this
court
required
in
the
squire
versus
capoeman
case.
it
would
be
an
implied
repeal
of
the
buck
act.
it
would
be
a
rejection
of
your
policy
in
frost
versus
wenie
that
federal
statutes
are
not
replied
--
repealed
by
implication.
it
would
be
a
repeal
by
implication
of
trader
act.
it
would
be
a
rejection
of
firm
congressional
policy
that
when
congress
wants
to
repeal
one
of
its
statutes,
it
says
so.
and--
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
your
honor,
it
was
unpublished
and
one
of
those
difficult
situations
in
which
i
learned
to
matthew
grant
too
late,
almost,
that
you
can
only
get
those
unpublished
committee
reports
and
typed
up
from
the
transcripts
if
you
get
special
permission
from
the
committee
itself
and
the
government
did
that
in
this
case
because
it’s
urgent
that
this
court
see
that
there
was
a
discussion
concerning
subsidy
to
the
states.
and
that
discussion
made
it
clear
that
congress
never
even
considered
in
committee
for
a
minute
imposing
any
tax
liability
on
the
indian
people
themselves.
now,
congressional
policy
in
1953
said,
“we
want
to
fulfill
this
hiatus
in
law
enforcement.
we
want
states
to
be
able
to
take
jurisdiction.”
in
1968,
that
policy
is
still
intact
except
with
consent
of
the
indian
people.
if
there
were
a
tax
affreightment
here,
if
there
were
a
tax
imposition,
no
indian
tribe
in
america
would
ever
consent
to
any
jurisdiction
no
matter
how
much
it
was
lacking
in
law
enforcement.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
the
states
neither
were
not
getting
any
additional
tax
revenue,
your
honor
and
many
of
them
refused
to
take
jurisdiction
just
for
that
reason.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
no,
your
honor.
you
should
read
that
language
specifically.
it’s
in
my
reply
brief
which
is
the
red
one
and
in
there
they
say,
“well,
wait
a
minute,
mr.
soloway.
if
you’re
going
give
jurisdiction
to
the
states,
these
indian
people
are
not
taxed,
are
they?”
and
he
said,
“well,
they
pay
certain
taxes
as
off
the
reservation
they
pay
taxes.”
but
he
said,
“but
their
land
is
not
taxed,
and
they
don’t
pay
income
tax,
and
their
corporations
on
the
reservation
don’t
pay
tax,
do
they?
so,
who’s
going
to
pay
for
this?”
that
was
the
general
tenor
of
the
conversations.
all
of
the
congressmen
recognized
there
was
no
tax
to
be
forthcoming
from
the
indian
people.
and
they
demanded
that
congress
subsidized
it
in
some
way
and
congress
decided
not
to.
in
north
dakota,
in
fact
passed
a
statute
saying,
we
take
jurisdiction
as
soon
as
the
bia
makes
provision
for
a
reimbursing
this
for
the
cost
and
it
was
held
that
that
could
not
be
done.
i
think
i
better
save
my
last
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
were
--
there
are
several
points
that
do
need
answering
here
and
i
would
take
them
in
order.
first,
i
am
not
surprised
that
the
attorney
general
came
up
finally
with
the
bootstrap
argument.
that
argument
is
the
state
provides
services
therefore
it
should
have
the
ability
to
tax.
that’s
a
normative
argument.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statutory
problem
of
acquiring
jurisdiction
for
taxing.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
but
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
first,
the
language
in
there
is
not
language
of
plenary
grant
such
as
you
find
in
the
termination
acts,
klamath
and
menominee.
it’s
very
concise
and
it’s
restricted
to
private
persons
and
private
property.
now,
when
you
get
to
the
cases
and
you
can
find
this
on
page
7.
the
cases
are
enumerated
on
the
brief
of
ncai.
you’ll
find
that
civil
law
and
criminal
law
are
not
the
entire
body
of
law.
there
is
an
additional
third
class
which
is
that
law
of
the
sort
of
interface
between
sovereignty
and
the
citizen.
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
government
or
the
federal
government
and
the
citizen
mostly
it
comes
up
in
connection
with
cases
of
administrative
proceedings.
but
a
tax
power
is
a
sovereign
power.
in
this
case,
we’re
discussing
the
conflict
between
tribal
tax
power
and
state
tax
power.
that
is
not
a
law
of
governing
private
persons
and
private
property
to
use
that
narrow
language.
and
the
attorney
general
failed
to
read
to
you
from
the
last
sentence
in
that
letter
from
ormie
louis
which
by
the
language
with
the
published
reports.
so,
it’s
nothing
new.
he
said,
but
with
he
said,
this
should
make
the
state
laws
apply
and
to
civil
transactions
among
indians.
taxing
power
by
either
state
or
the
tribe
is
not
a
civil
transaction.
that
clearly
is
outside
the
meaning
of
that
narrow
language
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
but
with
a
minimum
of
interference
with
indian
control
of
indian
affairs.
now,
the
court
might
say
to
itself
that
language
is
rather
broad
perhaps,
it’s
overly
broad
if
the
court
feels
it’s
overly
broad,
the
court
can
restrict
it.
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
should
restrict
in
accordance
with
the
court’s
rule
in
the
holy
church
case
in
which
the
church
in
new
york
imported
a
vicar
from
england
for
its
preacher.
and
they
clearly
violated
a
federal
statute
they
said,
you
shall
not
import
people
from
outside
the
country
to
take
jobs
for
you.
and
this
court
said,
when
language
can
be
extended
beyond
the
meaning
of
the
legislature,
it
must
be
restricted
to
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
when
it
says
as
specifically,
here
we
don’t
even
have
it
specifically.
we
have
just
broad
language
of
civil
law
as
true,
but
then
it’s
narrowed
by
those
modifiers
to
private
persons
and
private
property.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
well,
your
honor
you
have
to
read
that
in
context.
it
says
substantive
civil
laws
of
the
states
and
it
goes
on
to
talk
about
civil
transactions
among
indians.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
think
not.
i
would
say
that
that
has
to
do
with
the
sovereign
ability
of
a
state
to
tax.
the
tax
may
fall
on
many
areas
of
private
property,
transactions,
excise,
etcetera.
but
i
think
that
that
language
when
you
look
at
the
entire
statute,
look
at
the
entire
legislative
history,
there’s
no
tax
talk
specifically
tax
talk
except
on
that
discussion
in
the
sub-committee
hearing.
and
there
it’s
made
very
clear
that
congress
does
not
intend
to
any
tax
to
be
levied
from
the
indian
people.
it
was
never
discussed
and
clearly,
the
congress
first
purpose
in
the
1968
act
would
be
frustrated
if
they
were
eluding
on
of
state
taxes
prior
to
the
consent
by
the
indian
people
to
jurisdiction.
now,
i
answer
one
additional
argument
your
honors
and
that
is
--
this
is
the
bootstrap
argument.
the
argument
that
the
state
provides
services
and
therefore
they
should
have
the
power
to
tax.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
that’s
true
your
honor
and
it
also
says,
or
regulation
of
the
use
of
such
property
inconsistent
with
federal
policies
and
statutes.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
think
it
is
your
honor,
but
there
are
two
points
to
be
made
here.
one
is
that
the
language
of
encumbrance
--
this
court
found
on
the
squire
case
to
include
also
the
federal
income
tax
of
problem.
and
this
court
ruled
in
the
rickert
case
that
the
general
allotment
act
which
required
that
there
be
no,
at
the
end
of
the
trust
period,
there’ll
be
no
lien,
there’ll
be
no
prior
debt
which
could
attach
to
the
property
said.
that
language
in
extends
not
only
to
the
land,
but
to
the
horse,
the
plow
and
the
barns
on
that
building.
that’s
the
personal
property
needed
to
use
the
land.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
think
not
your
honor,
because
it
take
--
compare
mr.
tonasket
with
squire.
squire
was
lucky
enough,
fortunate
enough
not
to
have
growing
timber
on
his
land.
mr.
tonasket
has
nothing
but
grass.
now,
the
congress
--
the
purpose
of
congress
today
is
in
the
promulgating
the
tobacco
ordinance
of
the
colville
tribe
for
example
is
clearly
that
trust
land
be
utilized
in
a
modern
way.
it
is
no
part
in
expecting
the
indian
the
poor
indian
to
be
a
farmer
on
his
land
in
east
omak
which
is
an
indian
village.
when
he
has
no
timber
on
it
and
when
the
only
really
legitimate
and
sensible
method
of
developing
the
land
is
some
kind
of
a
commercial
enterprise.
now,
i
would
say
additionally,
your
honors,
that
in
the
kansas
indians
case,
this
court
said
specifically
that
conferring
rights
and
privileges
on
the
indians
cannot
affect
their
situation
which
can
only
be
changed
by
treaty
stipulation
or
voluntary
abandonment
of
their
tribe
and
organization.
in
the
case
which
the
attorney
general
cited
in
his
opinion
as
direct
president
goody
versus
smith,
the
court
the
quotations
there
are
from
the
in
re.
heff
case.
those
are
the
ones
in
which
the
court
had
earlier
said
mr.
justice
rutledge
and
in
a
not
very
well
thought
out
opinion
that
the
general
allotment
act
which
conferred
citizenship
and
the
right
to
vote
and
participate
in
government
also
made
people
subject
to
taxation
and
this
court
specifically
overruled
heff
in
united
states
versus
nice
in
1916.
so,
the
very
foundation
of
the
goody
versus
smith
case
has
been
overruled
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
robert
pirtle,
attorney
for
the
appellant
in
this
case.
this
case
comes
to
court
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
part
of
the
jurisdiction
was
noted
on
june
12,
1972.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
although
complicated
somewhat
by
later
enacted
legislation
both
by
the
state
of
washington,
the
colville
confederated
tribes
and
by
later
activities
of
the
state
and
the
appellant
and
the
tribes
and
the
federal
government.
we’ll
begin
here
with
the
thorough
recognition
that
washington
is
public
law
83-280
state.
that
is
pursuant
to
that
act,
it
has
taken
jurisdiction,
certain
jurisdiction
over
indians
and
indian
reservations.
the
reservation
here
is
the
colville
reservation
in
eastern
washington
comprising
some
1.3
million
acres.
it
is
governed
by
a
14-member
tribal
council
under
a
constitution
of
by-laws
approved
by
the
federal
government.
leonard
tonasket,
the
appellant
here
is
a
full-blood
indian.
he
is
a
direct
descendant
of
chief
tonasket
of
the
okanogan
band.
in
1964,
he
borrowed
some
$6,000
of
federally
restricted
funds
with
which
to
build
a
store
on
his
trust
allotment
inside
the
reservation.
that
land
was
specifically
approved
by
the
federal
government.
he
made
and
additional
loan
of
$800
to
with
which
to
purchase
cigarette
inventory.
that
loan
was
also
a
federally
restricted
funds
again
approved
by
the
federal
government.
he
operated
his
store
selling
cigarettes
and
sundries
and
indian
artifacts
and
clothing
as
a
trader
on
the
reservation
but
without
a
federal
trader’s
license.
he
did
not
collect
tax
for
the
state
of
washington
nor
for
the
tribe
at
that
time.
the
state
of
washington
arrested
him
in
1967
and
seized
his
cigarette
inventory
leaving
the
rest
of
his
inventory
intact.
he
then
began
this
action
inequity
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
his
rights
to
make
sales
in
the
reservation
on
his
trust
land.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
can
clarify
that
for
you,
your
honor.
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
that
public
law
83-280
specifically
granted
the
state
complete
jurisdiction
over
indian
trading
with
no
exceptions.
now,
the
state
of
washington
in
its
briefs
in
this
case
is
willing
to
concede
that
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction
over
trade
with
respect
to
indians.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
but
that’s
not
what
the
decision
says.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
can
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
it
is.
that’s
clearly
indian
commerce
within
the
federal
constitutional
definition,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
sales
from
the
indian
to
the
non-indian
on
the
reservation
also
come
within
that
definition.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
true.
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
your
honor,
i
did
not
try
this
case
in
the
superior
court,
so
i’m
somewhat
at
a
disadvantage
in
that
respect.
i
can
assure
you
that
i
would’ve
raised
the
question.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
superior
court
nor
argued
in
the
supreme
court.
but
it
is
a
viable
question
as
pointed
out
in
that
brief
and
it
will
be
raised
in
the
future.
the
court
would
want
to
consider
it.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
now,
i
believe
the
argument
was
made
with
respect
to
the
two
kinds
of
sales
but
the
supreme
court
decided
to
go
all
the
way.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
that
280
is
in
fact
effective
in
the
state,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
no,
we
have
to
distinguish
in
a
very
fine
way
here.
i
understood
the
previous
question
to
mean
is
public
law
83-280
actually
legally
approved
in
the
state
of
washington.
that
is
has
the
state
legally
accepted
jurisdiction?
that
is
the
contention
that
was
not
raised
below.
it
was
not
briefed
for
the
state
supreme
court
and
which
will
be
raised
in
the
later
case.
the
other
part
of
the
question
or
as
i
understand
it,
the
question
you’re
asking
now
is,
how
about
the
application
of
public
law
83-280
to
the
facts
of
this
case?
that
was
raised
in
expense
of
the
argument.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
it
was
your
honor.
yes.
and
extensively
argued.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
no,
the
amicus
brief
for
the
national
congress
of
american-indians
says,
“there
is
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
the
state
of
washington
has
complied
with
the
federal
requirements
and
assuming
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
public
law
83-280
and
the
court
should
recognize
that
fact
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
it
was
not
and
the
court
may
wish
to
remand
it
for
the
raising
and
briefing
of
that
issue,
your
honor,
especially
from
the
osburn,
say,
especially
in
the
light
of
the
new
legislative
history
concerning
public
law
83-280
which
has
just
been
uncovered
in
the
archives.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
well,
i
would
not
say
it
was
conceded,
your
honor.
it
was
not
raised
by
the
attorney
representing
the
appellant
below
and
i
was
not
in
the
position
to
raise
it
in
the
appellate
court
as
appellant
counsel.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
am
not
conceding
that
but
i’m
--
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
--
of
necessity
in
that
position.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
true.
now,
after
this
action
was
begun,
the
legislative
activity
which
i
referred
to
occurred.
washington
passed
a
new
act
concerning
the
regulation
of
cigarettes
in
1972.
that
act
specifically
authorized
any
citizen
of
the
state
of
washington
to
buy,
possess
and
use
two
cartons
of
tax-free
cigarettes
without
incurring
tax
liability.
--
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
two
cartons
per
person
at
any
one
given
time.
that
is
a
possession
matter.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
true.
and
the
oregon
tax
is
4
cents
which
is
13
cents
less
in
washington.
the
idaho
tax
is
7
cents
which
is
10
cents
less
and
many,
many
state
residents
have
been
going
back
and
forth
across
the
borders
bringing
cigarettes
in.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
act
in
1972.
towns
were
being
searched
and
the
housewives
of
the
important
people
on
the
state
were
very
angry.
although,
that’s
outside
the
record
but
it’s
well-known
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
after
the
act
which
governor
evans
characterized
as
legitimatizing
indian
sales
to
the
extent
of
two
cartons,
the
colville
confederated
tribes
enacted
the
colville
tobacco
ordinance
which
makes
the
handling
and
sale
of
all
cigarette
products
on
the
reservation
a
tribal
enterprise.
it
requires
that
the
outlets
be
licensed
by
the
tribe.
it
requires
that
the
operator
have
a
license
from
the
tribe,
that
the
operation
be
conducted
on
trust
land,
that
the
operator
have
a
federal
trader’s
license.
it
levies
a
tribal
tax
on
every
pack
of
cigarette
sold
on
the
reservation.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
he
does,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
the
record,
it’s
in
the
appendix.
it
was
not
in
the
case
below
but
of
course,
it
occurred
after
the
facts
of
this
case
happened.
he
has
a
license
from
the
tribe
and
from
the
federal
government
as
a
licensed
trader.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
no,
it
has
not,
your
honor.
it’s
still
on
his
trust
land
in
east
omak
which
is
an
indian
village.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
it
is.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
yes,
your
honor.
it’s
a
trust
allotment
under
the
general
allotment
act.
now,
the
law
which
applies
to
this
case
is
rather
not
preempting
but
the
central
issue
emerges
very
clearly.
that
is,
does
public
law
83-280
constitute
a
grant
of
tax
jurisdiction
to
the
state?
the
state
supreme
court
says,
“yes,
it
constitutes
a
plenary
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
indians
with
only
the
exception
set
forth
in
2
(b)
and
4
(b)
of
the
act.
the
court
went
further.
it
said
it
constitutes
a
complete
grant
to
the
state
of
indian
trading
jurisdiction.
now,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
examine
the
act.
putting
in
context,
in
1953,
congress
was
considering
a
number
of
major
cases
of
indian
legislation
following
four
or
five
separate
categories.
public
law
83-280
was
merely
one
piece.
it
had
a
narrow
legislative
purpose.
it
was
a
law
and
order
statute.
it
was
specifically
for
the
purpose
fulfilling
the
hiatus
in
law-enforcement
on
the
reservation
from
the
criminal
standpoint.
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
state
form
for
the
determination
of
civil
litigation
from
the
civil
standpoint.
and
if
you
examine
the
act,
the
language
of
the
act
from
page
a-10
of
brief,
you’ll
notice
that
it
says
that
the
jurisdiction
given
to
the
state
is
jurisdiction
over
civil
causes
of
action
and
it
provides
that
civil
laws
of
the
state
that
are
of
general
applicability
to
private
persons
or
private
property
shall
have
the
same
effect
on
indian
reservations.
now,
the
court
has
to
ask
itself,
is
that
language
of
plenary
grant
a
jurisdiction?
consider
it
was
respect
to
taxation.
it
says
nothing
about
taxation
but
when
congress
wants
state
taxes
to
apply
on
an
indian
reservation,
it
says
so
in
no
uncertain
terms.
look
at
the
claim
of
termination
act
on
page
27
of
the
brief.
it
provides
that
after
termination,
the
property
shall
be
subject
to
the
same
taxes,
state
and
federal,
as
in
the
case
of
non-indians.
look
at
menominee
termination
bill
on
page
30,
provides
that
all
statutes
of
the
united
states
which
affect
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians
shall
no
longer
be
applicable
and
it
provides
that
the
laws
of
the
state
shall
apply
to
the
tribe
and
its
members.
that
is
plenary
jurisdiction
grant
language.
now,
congress
has
made
one
general
act
with
respect
to
state
taxes
on
indian
reservations,
that’s
buck
act
which
you’ve
heard
referred
to
in
the
other
cases
today.
congress
said,
“states,
you
may
apply
your
taxes
in
federal
reservations
both
income,
use,
sales
but
you
may
not
apply
them
to
indian
reservations.”
that
has
never
changed.
frost
versus
wenie
says,
“acts
of
congress
will
not
be
deemed
repealed
by
implication.”
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
to
federal
reservations
but
not
indian
reservations.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
and
that’s
4
u.s.c.
109.
now,
when
congress
wants
state
tax
to
apply
on
an
indian
reservation,
it
says
it.
it
says
it
with
the
expressed
language.
it
provided
in
25
u.s.c.
section
398
that
minimal
interest
could
be
taxed.
it
provided
in
the
brown
stevens
bill,
public
law
291,
49
statute
65
that
taxation
could
apply
with
respect
to
one
state.
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
passed
public
law
83-280
and
it
said,
“now,
we’re
going
to
repeal
certain
statutes.
we’re
going
to
repeal
18
u.s.c.
section
1152.”
that
is
the
act
that
applies
the
federal
criminal
code
on
reservations.
it
repealed
it.
congress
said,
“we’re
going
to
repeal
18
u.s.c.
section
1153.
that
is
the
ten
major
crimes
act.
but
very
significantly,
your
honors,
congress
did
not
say,
“we’re
going
to
repeal
the
traders
act.”
congress
did
not
say,
“we’re
going
to
repeal
the
buck
act.”
congress
knew
what
it
was
repealing
and
what
it
was
not
repealing.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
especially
the
hearing
which
the
federal
government
just
find
on
archives,
the
hearing
of
the
subcommittee
of
june
29,
1953,
you’ll
find
the
tax
discussion
concerning
this
bill.
the
first
one
and
i’m
delighted
to
have
found
it
because
in
that,
mr.
soloway
who
was
chief
counsel
for
the
bia
discusses
the
question
of
subsidy
to
the
states
assuming
jurisdiction
under
this
act
and
the
congressmen
involved
are
congressmen
from
all
of
the
states
with
large
indian
populations
and
they
repeatedly
say,
“but
what
about
the
federal
subsidy?
who
will
pay
for
the
burden
on
the
court
system?
what
about
this
jurisdiction,
this
additional
law
and
order,
cost
to
the
states?”
and
mr.
soloway
says,
“the
government
feels
that
this
is
just
a
burden
the
states
have
got
to
assume
if
they
wanted.”
and
you
all
know
the
history
of
the
act.
some
states
refused
to
assume
that
burden
because
they
would
not
have
any
tax
money
to
pay
for
it
with.
this
is
the
point
in
the
dialogue
at
which
congress
if
it
had
ever
intended
it
would
have
said,
“congressmen,
you
may
now
have
your
states
tax
the
indians.
arizona,
you
can
tax
those
100,000
navajos
and
pay
for
this
jurisdiction
if
you
assume
it.
washington,
you
may
tax
those
26,000
indians
and
you
may
pay
for
this
jurisdiction
if
you
assume
it.”
congress
didn’t.
congress
left
the
buck
act
intact.
it
left
the
trader
statute
intact.
it
made
no
reference
to
the
taxation
and
public
law
83-280
in
terms
of
the
specific
grant
that
congress’
policy
dictates.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
uphold
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
case,
the
consequences
would
be
disastrous.
it
would
mean
an
impel
of
all
of
the
tax
immunities
of
indian
tribes
which
this
court
has
said
is
not
likely
to
be
attributed
to
congress
than
the
lone
wolf
and
hitchcock
case.
it
would
be
the
rejection
of
the
expressed
language
requirement
which
this
court
required
in
the
squire
versus
capoeman
case.
it
would
be
an
implied
repeal
of
the
buck
act.
it
would
be
a
rejection
of
your
policy
in
frost
versus
wenie
that
federal
statutes
are
not
replied
--
repealed
by
implication.
it
would
be
a
repeal
by
implication
of
trader
act.
it
would
be
a
rejection
of
firm
congressional
policy
that
when
congress
wants
to
repeal
one
of
its
statutes,
it
says
so.
and--
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
your
honor,
it
was
unpublished
and
one
of
those
difficult
situations
in
which
i
learned
to
matthew
grant
too
late,
almost,
that
you
can
only
get
those
unpublished
committee
reports
and
typed
up
from
the
transcripts
if
you
get
special
permission
from
the
committee
itself
and
the
government
did
that
in
this
case
because
it’s
urgent
that
this
court
see
that
there
was
a
discussion
concerning
subsidy
to
the
states.
and
that
discussion
made
it
clear
that
congress
never
even
considered
in
committee
for
a
minute
imposing
any
tax
liability
on
the
indian
people
themselves.
now,
congressional
policy
in
1953
said,
“we
want
to
fulfill
this
hiatus
in
law
enforcement.
we
want
states
to
be
able
to
take
jurisdiction.”
in
1968,
that
policy
is
still
intact
except
with
consent
of
the
indian
people.
if
there
were
a
tax
affreightment
here,
if
there
were
a
tax
imposition,
no
indian
tribe
in
america
would
ever
consent
to
any
jurisdiction
no
matter
how
much
it
was
lacking
in
law
enforcement.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
the
states
neither
were
not
getting
any
additional
tax
revenue,
your
honor
and
many
of
them
refused
to
take
jurisdiction
just
for
that
reason.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
no,
your
honor.
you
should
read
that
language
specifically.
it’s
in
my
reply
brief
which
is
the
red
one
and
in
there
they
say,
“well,
wait
a
minute,
mr.
soloway.
if
you’re
going
give
jurisdiction
to
the
states,
these
indian
people
are
not
taxed,
are
they?”
and
he
said,
“well,
they
pay
certain
taxes
as
off
the
reservation
they
pay
taxes.”
but
he
said,
“but
their
land
is
not
taxed,
and
they
don’t
pay
income
tax,
and
their
corporations
on
the
reservation
don’t
pay
tax,
do
they?
so,
who’s
going
to
pay
for
this?”
that
was
the
general
tenor
of
the
conversations.
all
of
the
congressmen
recognized
there
was
no
tax
to
be
forthcoming
from
the
indian
people.
and
they
demanded
that
congress
subsidized
it
in
some
way
and
congress
decided
not
to.
in
north
dakota,
in
fact
passed
a
statute
saying,
we
take
jurisdiction
as
soon
as
the
bia
makes
provision
for
a
reimbursing
this
for
the
cost
and
it
was
held
that
that
could
not
be
done.
i
think
i
better
save
my
last
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
were
--
there
are
several
points
that
do
need
answering
here
and
i
would
take
them
in
order.
first,
i
am
not
surprised
that
the
attorney
general
came
up
finally
with
the
bootstrap
argument.
that
argument
is
the
state
provides
services
therefore
it
should
have
the
ability
to
tax.
that’s
a
normative
argument.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statutory
problem
of
acquiring
jurisdiction
for
taxing.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
but
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
first,
the
language
in
there
is
not
language
of
plenary
grant
such
as
you
find
in
the
termination
acts,
klamath
and
menominee.
it’s
very
concise
and
it’s
restricted
to
private
persons
and
private
property.
now,
when
you
get
to
the
cases
and
you
can
find
this
on
page
7.
the
cases
are
enumerated
on
the
brief
of
ncai.
you’ll
find
that
civil
law
and
criminal
law
are
not
the
entire
body
of
law.
there
is
an
additional
third
class
which
is
that
law
of
the
sort
of
interface
between
sovereignty
and
the
citizen.
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
government
or
the
federal
government
and
the
citizen
mostly
it
comes
up
in
connection
with
cases
of
administrative
proceedings.
but
a
tax
power
is
a
sovereign
power.
in
this
case,
we’re
discussing
the
conflict
between
tribal
tax
power
and
state
tax
power.
that
is
not
a
law
of
governing
private
persons
and
private
property
to
use
that
narrow
language.
and
the
attorney
general
failed
to
read
to
you
from
the
last
sentence
in
that
letter
from
ormie
louis
which
by
the
language
with
the
published
reports.
so,
it’s
nothing
new.
he
said,
but
with
he
said,
this
should
make
the
state
laws
apply
and
to
civil
transactions
among
indians.
taxing
power
by
either
state
or
the
tribe
is
not
a
civil
transaction.
that
clearly
is
outside
the
meaning
of
that
narrow
language
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
but
with
a
minimum
of
interference
with
indian
control
of
indian
affairs.
now,
the
court
might
say
to
itself
that
language
is
rather
broad
perhaps,
it’s
overly
broad
if
the
court
feels
it’s
overly
broad,
the
court
can
restrict
it.
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
should
restrict
in
accordance
with
the
court’s
rule
in
the
holy
church
case
in
which
the
church
in
new
york
imported
a
vicar
from
england
for
its
preacher.
and
they
clearly
violated
a
federal
statute
they
said,
you
shall
not
import
people
from
outside
the
country
to
take
jobs
for
you.
and
this
court
said,
when
language
can
be
extended
beyond
the
meaning
of
the
legislature,
it
must
be
restricted
to
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
when
it
says
as
specifically,
here
we
don’t
even
have
it
specifically.
we
have
just
broad
language
of
civil
law
as
true,
but
then
it’s
narrowed
by
those
modifiers
to
private
persons
and
private
property.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
well,
your
honor
you
have
to
read
that
in
context.
it
says
substantive
civil
laws
of
the
states
and
it
goes
on
to
talk
about
civil
transactions
among
indians.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
think
not.
i
would
say
that
that
has
to
do
with
the
sovereign
ability
of
a
state
to
tax.
the
tax
may
fall
on
many
areas
of
private
property,
transactions,
excise,
etcetera.
but
i
think
that
that
language
when
you
look
at
the
entire
statute,
look
at
the
entire
legislative
history,
there’s
no
tax
talk
specifically
tax
talk
except
on
that
discussion
in
the
sub-committee
hearing.
and
there
it’s
made
very
clear
that
congress
does
not
intend
to
any
tax
to
be
levied
from
the
indian
people.
it
was
never
discussed
and
clearly,
the
congress
first
purpose
in
the
1968
act
would
be
frustrated
if
they
were
eluding
on
of
state
taxes
prior
to
the
consent
by
the
indian
people
to
jurisdiction.
now,
i
answer
one
additional
argument
your
honors
and
that
is
--
this
is
the
bootstrap
argument.
the
argument
that
the
state
provides
services
and
therefore
they
should
have
the
power
to
tax.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
that’s
true
your
honor
and
it
also
says,
or
regulation
of
the
use
of
such
property
inconsistent
with
federal
policies
and
statutes.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
think
it
is
your
honor,
but
there
are
two
points
to
be
made
here.
one
is
that
the
language
of
encumbrance
--
this
court
found
on
the
squire
case
to
include
also
the
federal
income
tax
of
problem.
and
this
court
ruled
in
the
rickert
case
that
the
general
allotment
act
which
required
that
there
be
no,
at
the
end
of
the
trust
period,
there’ll
be
no
lien,
there’ll
be
no
prior
debt
which
could
attach
to
the
property
said.
that
language
in
extends
not
only
to
the
land,
but
to
the
horse,
the
plow
and
the
barns
on
that
building.
that’s
the
personal
property
needed
to
use
the
land.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
i
think
not
your
honor,
because
it
take
--
compare
mr.
tonasket
with
squire.
squire
was
lucky
enough,
fortunate
enough
not
to
have
growing
timber
on
his
land.
mr.
tonasket
has
nothing
but
grass.
now,
the
congress
--
the
purpose
of
congress
today
is
in
the
promulgating
the
tobacco
ordinance
of
the
colville
tribe
for
example
is
clearly
that
trust
land
be
utilized
in
a
modern
way.
it
is
no
part
in
expecting
the
indian
the
poor
indian
to
be
a
farmer
on
his
land
in
east
omak
which
is
an
indian
village.
when
he
has
no
timber
on
it
and
when
the
only
really
legitimate
and
sensible
method
of
developing
the
land
is
some
kind
of
a
commercial
enterprise.
now,
i
would
say
additionally,
your
honors,
that
in
the
kansas
indians
case,
this
court
said
specifically
that
conferring
rights
and
privileges
on
the
indians
cannot
affect
their
situation
which
can
only
be
changed
by
treaty
stipulation
or
voluntary
abandonment
of
their
tribe
and
organization.
in
the
case
which
the
attorney
general
cited
in
his
opinion
as
direct
president
goody
versus
smith,
the
court
the
quotations
there
are
from
the
in
re.
heff
case.
those
are
the
ones
in
which
the
court
had
earlier
said
mr.
justice
rutledge
and
in
a
not
very
well
thought
out
opinion
that
the
general
allotment
act
which
conferred
citizenship
and
the
right
to
vote
and
participate
in
government
also
made
people
subject
to
taxation
and
this
court
specifically
overruled
heff
in
united
states
versus
nice
in
1916.
so,
the
very
foundation
of
the
goody
versus
smith
case
has
been
overruled
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
pirtle
thank
you
your
honor.
