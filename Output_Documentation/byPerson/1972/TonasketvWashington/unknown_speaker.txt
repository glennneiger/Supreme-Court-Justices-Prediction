unknown
speaker
now,
those
are
the
amicus,
but
where
is
the
colville?
unknown
speaker
any
big
cities
near
the
colville.
unknown
speaker
how
many
cities?
unknown
speaker
general
gorton,
i
understood
the
opinion
of
the
--
of
your
state
court
to
all
of
the
taxes
applicable
whether
the
sales
were
to
indians
or
non-indians.
unknown
speaker
but
your
state
court
understood
that
the
issue
was
involved
sales
to
indians
or
non-indians?
unknown
speaker
are
you
thinking
account
on
the
washington
law
passed
february
of
this
year?
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
statute
passed?
unknown
speaker
so
this
was
after
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suppose
that
the
supreme
court
would
have
any
different
view
of
this
case,
had
there
--
had
it
had
the
new
statute
before
it?
unknown
speaker
but
let’s
assume
–
let’s
assume
that
the
act
was
construable.
you
say
it
isn’t,
let
suppose
that
was
construable
to
say
that
the
indians
could
sell
some
exempt
sales
and
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
construed
the
act
that
way.
would
it
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
--
so
there
would
have
been
a
quite
a
different
result
in
this
case
or
not?
unknown
speaker
attorney
general,
you
have
one
view
of
it,
but
--
the
solicitor
general
and
others
have
a
different
view
of
it.
since
your
supreme
court
didn’t
have
it
before
it
when
it
decided
the
case,
why
don’t
we
not
send
this
back,
vacate
this
judgment,
send
it
back
for
reconsideration
on
light
of
the
new
statute?
let
your
supreme
court
after
all
has
finally
decide
it.
then
you
won’t
have
to
have
this
argument
with
the
bench.
[laughter]
if
you’re
so
correct.
unknown
speaker
governor
evans
is
surrounded
by
very
talented
lawyers,
he
doesn’t
write
these
things
in
vacuole?
unknown
speaker
no,
we’re
just
asking
you
to
do
what’s
you’ve
have
been
doing,
argue
it.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
mr.
(inaudible)
has
used.
to
send
it
back
would
be
useless?
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure
that
your
supreme
court’s
going
to
construe
the
statute
to
a
new
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
we
decide
a
federal
question
if
this
case
goes
away,
if
your
supreme
court
construes
your
new
statute,
contrary
to
the
way
you
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
we
may
be
as
capable
but
their
view
of
the
statute
is
what
governs
us.
we
can’t
construe
it
for
ourselves.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
you
would
say
--
you
would
say
it.
now,
let’s
assume
you
agreed
for
the
moment
that
the
statute
was
ambiguous.
would
you
suggest
then
that
we
send
it
back
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
it’s
just
of
really
comes
down
to
a
matter
whether
we
agree
with
you
that
the
statute
is
so
clear
on
its
face
that
any
arguments
that
--
has
to
its
meaning
contrary
to
yours
is
frivolous?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
whatever
the
construction
of
the
72
act
whichever
way
it’s
construed
it
wouldn’t
control
the
outcome
of
this
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
just
awhile
ago,
i
thought
you
said
that
it
would
made
quite
a
difference
if
the
statute
have
been
before
your
state
supreme
court
and
the
state
supreme
court
took
up
the
same
view
of
the
statute
--
took
a
view
of
statute
contrary
to
yours.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
i
thought
the
solicitor
general
construed
the
statute
to
mean
that
a
seller
could
sell
two
cartons
to
anyone
person
at
anyone
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
now,
we’re
back
to
the
same
old
thing.
how
about
your
governor,
he
construed
at
the
same
way,
didn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
he
didn’t?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
income
tax
on
farm
income
from
allotted
lands
after
that
280?
unknown
speaker
but
arguably
squire
would
govern
that?
unknown
speaker
it’s
from
transactions.
unknown
speaker
well,
section
2
(b)
and
4
(b)
as
i
read
them
cited
that
this
section
which
is
the
at
new
law
280
shall
--
nothing
in
this
section
shall
authorize
the
taxation
of
any
real
or
personal
property
of
any
indian
or
indian
tribe.
unknown
speaker
now,
those
are
the
amicus,

where
is
