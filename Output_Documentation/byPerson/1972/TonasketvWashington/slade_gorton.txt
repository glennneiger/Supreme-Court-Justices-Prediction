mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
first
assertion
in
this
court
that
an
individual
indian
citizen
may
engage
in
a
private
commercial
venture
literally,
any
private
commercial
venture
in
direct
competition
with
other
citizens
of
the
state
or
for
that
matter
even
with
other
indians
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
been
declared
competent
or
to
have
moved
off
the
reservation
with
paying
or
collecting
any
of
the
excise
taxes
applicable
to
all
such
businesses
on
an
equal
basis
conducted
by
other
citizens
of
the
state.
it
involves
a
claim
of
a
right
literally
to
destroy
those
other
competing
businesses,
a
claim,
which
is
asserted
again
by
a
citizen
entitled
by
the
constitution
to
every
right
and
privilege
extended
by
the
state
to
every
other
citizen.
the
factual
setting
and
which
this
claim
arrives
is
this.
the
colville
reservation
is
not
an
isolated
track
in
the
state
of
washington
occupied
only
by
indians.
nor
for
that
matter
are
the
amicus
reservations.
they
lie
close
tacoma,
to
olympia,
to
seattle
and
the
various
other
major
metropolitan
areas
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
colville
is
this
very
large
one
here.
the
amicus
are
here,
here,
here
and
here.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
getting
to
the
city,
which
is
partly
on
the
colville
reservation
right
now.
the
colville
reservation
under
the
1970
census
figures
has
1,779
indian
inhabitants
and
2,429
or
58%
non-indian
inhabitants
on
the
reservation.
this
is
a
bia
map,
the
upper
right
hand
corner
shows
the
entire
reservation,
which
is
in
yellow
on
the
other
map.
this
section
is
the
northwest
corner
of
the
map.
the
city
of
omak,
washington
incidentally
both
our
briefs
and
the
other
briefs
are
in
error
in
speaking
of
the
city
called
east
omak.
there
is
simply
in
washington
a
city
of
omak,
washington,
which
lies
on
both
sides
of
the
okanogan
river,
which
is
the
boundary
of
the
colville
reservation
and
roughly
this
portion
of
the
reservation
is
inside
the
city
of
omak.
the
white
areas
on
this
map
are
allotted
indian
lands.
the
park
outline
in
red
is
where
the
particular
cigarette
sales
of
mr.
tonasket
take
place.
green
are
tribal
lands
both
white
and
green
are
therefore
restricted
in
the
terms
that
have
been
used
here
for
the
last
two
days.
the
yellow
lands
are
those
lands
on
this
part
of
the
indian
reservation
only,
which
have
been
patented
and
which
are
therefore
subject
to
taxation.
most
of
which
have
probably
been
sold
to
non-indians,
but
even
if
they
are
still
retained
by
indians,
those
yellows
lands
on
the
reservation
do
not
support
the
peculiar
claims
for
their
owners,
which
the
appellant
makes
here
for
his
land.
which
is
still
restricted
as
far
as
alienation
and
taxation
is
concerned.
this
portion,
which
is
the
upper
part
of
this
section
(a),
is
in
the
city
of
omak.
some
tribal
land,
some
allotted
land,
a
larger
amount
of
patented
land.
mr.
slade
gorton
just
over
4000
people
and
it
is
the
largest
city
on
the
reservation
--
the
city
of
okanogan,
which
is
the
county
city
has
about
half
that
number.
there
are
several
other
incorporated
towns
on
or
immediately
adjacent
to
that
reservation.
it’s
not
until
you
get
to
the
amicus
tribes
that
you
get
to
the
extremely
large
cities
of
the
state
of
washington
or
their
immediate
area.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
only
section
does
not
concern
you
here.
this
is
just
that
if
we’re
off
the
reservation.
the
point,
mr.
justice
douglas
is
that
on
reservations
in
the
state
of
washington
not
just
the
colville
reservation.
this
is
a
very
typical
pattern.
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
situation
the
navajos
described
yesterday
where
indian
country
is
simply
[voice
overlap]
mr.
slade
gorton
there
are
maybe
a
few
of
the
(inaudible).
mr.
slade
gorton
oh!
yes,
they
do
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
city
of
toppenish
is
entirely
located
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
yakima.
mr.
slade
gorton
patented
land.
mr.
slade
gorton
much
land
on
the
yakima
reservation
has
been
patented.
not
the
upper
parts
of
the
reservation
in
the
rural
areas.
mr.
slade
gorton
where
the
--
where
wapato
and
toppenish
of
that
area
is
mostly
patented
land.
though,
again
there
is
a
mixture
as
there
is
here.
there’s
land
retained
by
indians
even
down
there.
moreover,
there’s
one
other
point,
far
from
all
of
the
indians
on
the
colville
--
in
the
colville
tribe
live
on
the
reservation.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
between
half
and
three
quarters
of
them
leave
off
the
reservation
add
to
that
number,
those
indians
living
on
patented
lands
on
the
reservation
and
it’s
clear
that
the
extraordinary
privileges
claimed
by
appellant
are
likely
to
be
available
only
to
a
capriciously
fortunate
minority
of
colville
or
other
indians.
and
it’s
this
integration
in
these
reservations,
which
gives
rise
to
the
importance
of
this
case.
indeed,
i
think
to
its
very
existence
and
presence
before
you.
it’s
this
integration,
i
believe,
which
accounts
for
the
fact
that
until
a
last-ditch
effort
to
show
up
appellant’s
claim
to
tax
exemption
last
spring.
the
federal
indian
trader
act
was
simply
unused
in
the
state
of
washington
except
on
two
isolated
coastal
reservations.
they
were
all
together.
they
shop
in
the
same
store
as
whether
they
were
indian
or
non-indians.
now,
the
approach
of
congress
to
indian
tax
exemptions
has
been
to
set
out
post
exemptions
explicitly
by
statute.
mr.
cohen’s
treaties
are
written
for
that
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
which
was
quoted
here
yesterday.
it
says,
“indeed,
such
exemptions
as
apply
to
specific
federal
or
state
taxes
on
the
income
of
indians
or
on
their
property
must
be
found
then
or
derived
from
statutes
and
treaties
or
agreements
with
the
indian
tribes.”
the
approach
of
this
court
for
many
years
has
been
identical.
it
has
based
successful
exemption
claims
only
on
specific
acts
of
congress
and
not
since
the
demise
of
implied
governmental
immunity
34
years
ago
in
the
helvering
case
on
general
philosophical
concepts.
now,
appellants
first
and
chief
claim
to
a
statutory
exemption
is
based
on
the
indian
trader
act
and
this
court’s
decision
in
warren
trading
post.
the
exemption,
which
this
court
found
there
was
limited
specifically
and
cautiously
and
by
its
expressed
terms
to
sales
by
a
license
indian
trader
to
indians,
a
class
of
sales
of
cigarettes
which
washington
statutes
themselves
exempt
at
the
present
time.
the
indian
trader
act,
the
first
section
of
which
is
25
u.s.c.
261
speaks
directly
of
sales
to
indians.
in
fact,
should
the
sec
--
should
the
act
be
construed
to
apply
to
sales
by
indians
to
non-indians.
section
262
and
264
clearly
require
each
non-indian
purchaser
to
obtain
an
indian
trader’s
license,
to
go
and
buy
these
cigarettes.
the
absurdity
of
this
result
indicates
the
absurdity
of
appellant’s
claim
that
he
is
exempted
by
the
indian
trader
act
from
a
general
non-discriminatory
excise
tax
on
his
sales
to
non-indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
will
certainly
get
to
that
what
i
consider
to
be
a
philosophical
point
because
we
will
claim
that
warren
trading
post
is
not
applicable
to
the
state
of
washington
because
of
pl
83-280.
the
point
i'm
making
now
is
that
those
cigarettes
which
we
actually
our
attempting
to
tax.
i
think
that
exemption
may
have
come
into
existence
since
the
--
this
since
is
rather
--
this
case
has
gone
a
long
time
since
it
came
into
existence.
but
the
point
that
we’re
arguing
for
here
is
solely
the
proposition
of
sales
to
non-indians.
we
are
not
now
trying
to
impose
a
cigarette
tax
on
indians.
we
would
claim
under
pl
280
that
we
could
if
we
wish,
but
we
are
not
trying
to
do
that
now
in
this
case.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
did
not
argue
the
case
and
the
state
supreme
court.
i
think
mr.
pirtle
statement
yesterday
was
right
that
the
distinction
was
made
in
the
supreme
court
argument.
it
was
not
made
by
our
state
supreme
court.
in
any
event,
it’s
conscious
of
our
state
statutes
in
the
exemption
which
they
provide
not
just
for
sales
by
red
license
indian
traders,
but
simply
sales
to
non-indians
by
any
indians
tribe
or
through
any
indian
tribe.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
your
honor
i
am.
to
the
contrary
of
the
position
of
even
the
solicitor
of
much
less
the
appellants,
that
act
doesn’t
--
was
designed
to
close
the
cigarette
tax
loopholes
against
indians.
the
same
legislature,
which
passed
that
statute,
passed
a
conditional
appropriations
act
of
$8
million
based
on
the
usefulness
of
that
act
in
closing
of
these
indian
cigarettes
sales.
in
october
this
year
for
example,
the
loss
to
the
state
from
indian
cigarettes
sales
of
taxes
alone
was
--
cigarette
taxes
alone
was
well
over
$600,000.
that
act
by
its
terms
simply
says
that
the
state
will
no
longer
engage
in
useless
acts.
this
court
has
recognized
--
the
court
has
recognized
that
a
state
can’t
collect
an
excise
tax
from
the
purchaser
after
he
has
made
a
purchase
and
distribute
it
himself
to
his
home.
an
excise
tax
like
this
has
got
to
be
collected
to
the
seller
to
be
collected
at
all.
there
was
an
error
in
fact
in
the
argument
yesterday
about
competing
cigarette
taxes.
our
tax
is
16
cents,
oregon’s
tax
is
9
cents,
idaho’s
tax
is
9.1
cents,
but
this
does
mean
that
people
will
try
to
get
away
from
taxes
when
they
can.
that’s
why
these
people
are
selling
cigarettes.
what
this
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no
sir,
it
does
not.
it
allows
the
possession
by
any
one
for
use
of
two
cartons
of
cigarettes.
mr.
slade
gorton
no
sir,
it
does
not
exempt
any
sale.
it
does
not
exempt
any
sale
if
there
interpretation
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
does
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
says,
solely
and
only
that
the
possession
of
two
cartons
of
cigarettes
at
a
time
is
not
subject
to
a
tax.
it
does
not
allow
anyone
to
sell
cigarettes
even
two
cartons
much
less
to
posses
400
or
500.
it
is
design
solely
to
prevent
the
theoretical
application
to
allot
to
someone
who
buys
two
cartons
of
cigarettes.
mr.
slade
gorton
it’s
--
the
act
is
clear.
the
act
--
that
portion
of
the
act
is
absolutely
clear
that
exemption
applies
only
to
possession
and
never
to
sale.
not
to
the
sale
of
a
single
cigarette
and
it’s
like
many
--
mr.
slade
gorton
possession
by
any
purpose
for
purposes
other
than
resale.
this
what
the
statute
says,
if
acquired
and
possessed
for
purposes
other
than
resale
400
or
less
cigarettes
at
any
single
time.
now,
this
appellant
is
out
of
that
for
two
reasons.
first,
of
course
he
obviously
has
more
than
400
cigarettes
at
the
time,
and
secondly,
he
holds
them
for
resale.
that’s
what
he’s
doing,
that’s
with
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
slade
gorton
to
the
effect
that
the
exemption
from
a
use
tax
which
we
just
couldn’t
collect
and
which
no
state
can
collect.
this
kind
of
exemption
i'm
sure
exists
in
many
state
excise
tax
statutes
where
you
don’t
--
it’s
impractical
to
try
to
make
a
criminal
out
of
the
purchaser.
you
must
collect
these
taxes
from
the
seller
or
you
can’t
collect
them
at
all.
now,
appellant’s
next
claim
to
a
statutory
exemption
from
these
particular
excise
taxes
is
based
on
section
6
of
the
general
allotment
act
is
applied
by
this
court
in
squire
versus
capoeman.
in
that
case,
chief
justice
warren
stated
that
income
from
a
timber
sale
from
mr.
capoeman’s
allotment.
the
sale
over
which
he
had
no
control
was
exempt
from
the
federal
tax
on
capital
gains.
this
court
found
the
sale
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
sale
of
the
land
itself.
the
finding
was
obviously
correct
and
equally
obviously
inapplicable
here.
timber
can
be
cut
from
land
such
as
mr.
capoeman’s,
literally
once
in
a
lifetime
or
less
and
the
land
that
was
found
by
the
court
had
little,
if
any
additional
value
so
that
the
proceeds
of
the
timber
sale
constituted
the
only
income
in
all
probability,
which
the
allotment
would
provide
for
mr.
capoeman
in
his
lifetime
and
amounted
for
his
purposes
were
concern
to
a
sale
of
the
whole
property.
he
had
control
over
neither
the
fact
nor
the
timing
of
the
sale.
mr.
tonasket’s
income
here
however
is
continuing.
it
is
neither
based
on
the
fruits
of
the
land
nor
on
its
exhaustion.
it
is
simple
business
income.
moreover,
mr.
capoeman’s
tax
exemption
had
no
adverse
effects
on
timber
sales
by
non-exempt
landowners.
mr.
tonasket’s
claim
on
the
other
hand,
if
upheld
can
and
will
destroy
the
businesses
of
competing
sellers
of
cigarettes
or
of
any
other
commodity,
which
mr.
tonasket
chooses
to
sell
at
retail.
finally,
it
seems
doubtful
that
mr.
tonasket’s
inevitable
claim
to
a
federal
income
tax
exemption
on
the
profits
of
his
sales
is
likely
to
have
much
appeal
to
this
court.
yet,
it
is
the
logical
corollary
of
the
extension
of
squire
versus
capoeman
to
a
situation
now
before
you,
which
was
certainly
not
in
the
minds
of
the
court
at
the
time
that
which
that
case
was
decided.
appellant’s
final
statutory
claim
to
exemption
is
based
on
section
4
of
pl
83-280
itself.
a
statute
designed
to
authorize
the
extension
of
state
jurisdiction
over
indian
reservations.
the
statute
itself
provides
that
it
shall
not
“authorize
the
encumbrance
or
taxation
of
any
real
or
personal
property
belonging
to
any
indian
that
is
subject
to
a
restriction
against
alienation
imposed
by
the
united
states”.
first
of
course,
that
statute
doesn’t
grant
any
tax
exemption.
it
simply
preserves
those
granted
by
other
statutes
from
encroachment
by
the
state.
moreover,
it
like
all
of
those
other
statutes
except
perhaps
the
indian
trader
act
deals
solely
with
property
taxation.
nothing
can
be
more
clear
from
the
decisions
this
court
and
for
that
matter
practically
every
other
court
in
the
land
then
the
distinction
between
property
and
non-property
taxes.
this
court
in
u.s.
v.
detroit
even
allowed
the
taxation
on
the
leasehold
interest
on
federal
lands
leased
to
private
persons.
the
cigarette
taxes
and
the
sales
taxes
here
in
question
are
in
no
way
property
taxes.
in
addition,
these
excise
taxes
have
two
distinguishing
features
not
shared
by
inheritance
taxes
involved
in
the
oklahoma
cases
or
for
that
matter
even
by
net
income
taxes.
first
of
course,
the
ultimate
burden
of
these
taxes
does
not
normally
rest
on
the
business
charge
with
paying
or
collecting
them.
they
are
passed
on
to
the
ultimate
purchaser
of
the
cigarettes
or
other
items
offered
for
sale
by
the
retailer.
in
fact,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
washington
state
law
requires
that
the
sales
tax
be
passed
on.
it
is
not
permitted
to
be
absorbed
by
the
retailer.
second
of
course,
appellant’s
claim
involves
the
right
to
destroy
all
of
his
competition
in
the
sale
of
cigarettes.
appellant
asserts
in
his
brief
that
the
3
cents
tax
by
the
colville
tribe
on
each
pack
if
added
to
the
state
16
cent
tax
will
wipe
out
his
ability
to
sell
cigarettes.
how
many
cigarettes
then
will
a
competitor
in
the
city
of
omak
without
appellant’s
claim
the
exemptions
sale
subject
to
a
16-cent
tax
in
competition
with
appellant’s
3
cents?
for
that
matter,
how
many
appliances
can
a
non-indian
businessman
in
omak
sell
on
which
he
must
charge
of
5%
sales
tax
in
competition
with
appellant
who
claims
the
right
to
sell
the
same
article
free
from
taxes?
for
that
matter,
referring
back
to
one
of
yesterday’s
cases,
can
a
similar
businessman
in
seattle
sells
cigarettes
or
appliances
in
competition
with
an
indian
seller
for
whom
that
bia
acquires
property
in
seattle
under
the
claim
of
right
asserted
here
yesterday
by
the
appellant
in
skelera
(ph).
please
remember
that
this
appellant
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
washington
entitled
to
the
rights
of
every
other
citizen
including
police
protection,
schools,
and
every
other
state
and
local
governmental
service.
nor
is
this
a
theoretical
entitlement.
all
state
and
local
governmental
services
are
actually
extended
to
indians
by
washington
state
often
that
a
per
capital
cost
to
the
state
in
excess
of
that
to
the
average
of
non-indians.
in
point
of
fact,
we
can
at
least
asked
the
rhetorical
question
whether
congress
could
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
require
us
first
in
1924
to
have
all
indians
as
citizens
and
then
say
that
they
should
pay
no
taxes
at
all
and
this
arises
in
these
cases
not
an
income
tax
cases
or
inheritance
tax
cases,
which
affect
only
the
state.
but
in
this
case
which
affects
other
citizens
of
the
state
and
their
ability
to
do
business.
now,
at
this
point
except
in
passing,
i
haven’t
mentioned
pl
83-280
for
what
i
consider
to
be
good
reason.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
extended
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
to
impose
cigarette
sales
taxes,
cigarette
taxes,
and
sales
taxes
in
colville
reservation.
because
the
state
already
had
that
right,
but
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
jurisdiction,
it
is
surely
dispelled
by
pl
83-280.
and
that
statute
is
relevant
in
connection
with
the
one
point
in
this
case
and
which
the
solicitor
general
asserts
the
possession,
sales
of
cigarettes
to
indians
which
are
tax-exempt
under
the
doctrine
of
warren
trading
post
in
the
absence
of
pl
83-280.
now,
appellant
has
labored
long
in
this
murky
legislative
history
of
pl
83-280
without
i
submit
producing
a
shred
of
evidence
that
it
was
intended
to
bar
these
taxes.
he
asserts
that
the
law
does
nothing
more
than
to
extend
state
court
jurisdiction.
the
statute
help
--
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
justice
douglas,
governor
evans
is
a
good
personal
friend
of
mine,
but
he
is
not
a
lawyer
and
he
is
clearly
in
error
in
that
statement.
that
indian
cigarette
tax
statute
is
clear
on
its
face
and
it
just
simply
does
not
legitimize
such
sales
and
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
is
from
reading
that
statute
which
is
the
place
where
one
will
normally
go
to
determining
its
meaning.
mr.
slade
gorton
to
sell
to
indians,
your
honor.
if
you
will
read
the
titles
82,
24
and
28,
this
is
what
my
answer
was
here.
this
has
been
a
case.
this
was
a
case
before
1972.
the
1972
statute
did
not
extend
any
right
to
sell
by
indians
to
indians
which
didn’t
previously
exist
in
our
statute.
that
was
already
there
--
the
1972
act
added
the
provision
in
this
particular
respect
not
with
the
person,
this
is
any
person
may
acquire
and
to
physically
possess
if
acquired
and
declared
and
possessed
for
purposes
other
than
resale
“for
purposes
other
than
resale”
400
or
less
cigarettes
in
any
single
time
without
incurring
tax
liability
and
that
was
the
only
addition,
which
was
made
by
the
statute,
which
is
relevant
to
this
particular
question.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
the
1972
session
of
state
legislation.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
no
way,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
there’s
other
legislative
history
of
this
act,
which
indicates
that
the
legislature
felt
that
it
was
closing
an
$8
million
per
loophole
by
passing
this
act
in
imposing
the
cigarette
tax
on
the
--
at
the
moment
the
cigarettes
came
in
to
the
state
and
before
even
arrived
on
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
would
be
--
that
would
govern.
mr.
slade
gorton
if
it
had,
it
is
if
you’re
correct
that
my
position
is
that
it
is
not
construable
that’s
clear
on
its
face,
but
this
--
mr.
slade
gorton
your
honor,
we
have
--
mr.
slade
gorton
you’re
asking
me
to
testify
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor
[laughter].
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
well,
not
when
you
ask
me
what
governor
evans
was
advised
your
honor.
[laughter]
my
point
in
this
particular
case
though,
is
that
that
is
essentially
a
useless
act.
you
have
this
case
in
all
of
its
panoply
before
you.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
because
you
will
get
an
inevitable
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
slade
gorton
edit
the
state
taxing
statute.
now,
if
you
feel
in
an
excess
of
caution
that
you
wish
to
do
that,
you
nonetheless
have
the
right
and
i
believe
this
is
the
right
time
to
construe
[voice
overlap].
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
i
suppose
my
answer
to
that
has
to
be
that
you
are
at
least
as
capable
of
reading
a
statute
as
our
state
supreme
court
is
and
when
we
[voice
overlap].
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
you
have
two
other
cases
here
in
front
of
you
which
involved
at
least
some
of
the
same
questions
except
for
the
effect
of
pl
83-280.
you
were
asked
yesterday
by
appellant
to
send
that
back
to
our
supreme
court
to
determine
whether
it
was
correctly
passed.
our
supreme
court
already
ruled
on
that,
so
as
our
federal
district
court,
so
as
our
ninth
circuit
court.
that
too
would
be
frivolous
act.
those
cases
are
already
in
our
–-
cited
in
our
briefs.
we
have
a
case
here
on
federal
law,
on
federal
questions,
which
is
right
then
which
is
before
you.
on
those
federal
questions
and
under
which
you
don’t
need
to
get
to
this.
this
man
by
his
complaint
is
engaged
in
this
resale
of
cigarettes.
that’s
a
plain
term,
that’s
what
his
business
is
--
the
resale
of
cigarettes.
forever,
[voice
overlap].
mr.
slade
gorton
if
the
state
statute
is
ambiguous
and
if
it
controls
your
decision
in
the
case,
you
would
have
to.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
that
that
is
essential
in
the
case,
your
honor.
as
long
as
you
decide
that
this
case
would
be
governed
by
a
state
statute
even
if
that
we’re
construed
the
other
way.
what
if
it
was
construed
to
allow
someone
to
possess
and
resale
two
cartons
of
cigarettes,
which
is
all
they
claim
for.
still
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
person
here
who
buys
and
resale
two
cartons
of
cigarettes.
this
is
a
big
business.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
will
not
help
mr.
tonasket
who
is
not
a
purchaser
and
seller
of
two
cartons
of
cigarettes
under
any
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
there
are
many
ways
to
i
which
they
can
take
a
contrary
to
mine,
your
honor.
they
could
say
that
a
person
may
sell
two
cartons
of
cigarettes
in
an
isolated
sale
without
being
subject
to
the
statute.
that
would
be
contrary
to
my
view,
but
that
wouldn’t
help
mr.
tonasket.
he
is
a
commercial
seller
of
cigarettes.
he
doesn’t
buy
two
cartons
of
cigarettes
and
sell
them
to
a
particular
friend
and
then
go
buy
two
more
and
sell
them
to
a
friend.
he
is
engaged
in
a
commercial
enterprise
in
competition
with
those
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
solicitor
general
did,
but
the
solicitor
general
i
will
submit
in
this
particular
case
totally
misconstrued
if
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
unless,
you
can
say
for
his
construction
was
the
one
that
we’ve
--
i
discussed
here
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
have,
yes
and
excuse
me,
the
sales
tax
issue
is
still
here
with
you.
the
fact
that
the
sales
taxes
applicable
to
these
sales
and
that
this
particular
claimant,
claims
the
right
to
sell
this
article
and
other
articles
free
from
the
state
sales
tax,
which
includes
no
such
exemption
in
it.
so,
in
any
event,
you
have
that
matter
before
you.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
your
honor,
i
was
and
it
was
in
that
connection
that
this
so-called
new
legislative
history
was
brought
up
and
sent
to
us
about
10
days
ago.
and
we
on
monday,
found
something
in
the
file,
which
we’re
not
supplied
by
the
solicitor
general.
a
letter
from
the
assistant
secretary
to
the
interior
to
the
house
committee,
the
original
bill
in
1953
hr10-63
included
only
the
language
on
jurisdiction
over
civil
causes
of
action
in
this
particular
respect.
the
secretary
suggested
the
language
in
which
the
bill
actually
passed
and
said
this
that
it
was
to
extend
to
those
reservations
the
substantive
civil
laws
of
the
state
in
so
far,
as
these
laws
are
of
general
application
to
private
persons
or
private
property.
anyone
on
the
call
for
the
preservation
on
indian
law
were
not
inconsistent
with
applicable
state
laws
to
assure
“the
predominance
of
state
authority”.
now,
can
anyone
seriously
assert
that
the
state
excise
tax
laws
are
not
substantive
civil
laws
of
general
application?
to
state
that
question
is
simply
to
answer
it.
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely
and
that
is
what
congress
did
mr.
chief
justice
in
pl-280.
it
accepted
the
property
taxes
on
allotted
lands,
it
accepted
to
a
certain
extent
indian
laws
where
they
want
inconsistent
with
state
law.
that’s
why
it
was
not
a
termination
act.
the
same
congress
passed
a
group
of
termination
acts.
they
wiped
out
the
indian
tribes
as
entities.
the
existence
of
their
reservations
and
property
tax
exemptions,
this
was
not
a
termination
act,
but
it
was
an
act
which
says
that
except
where
we
have
said
specifically
to
the
contrary,
the
state
has
all
jurisdictions.
you
just
can’t
get
any
clearer,
actually
it’s
a
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
would
be
an
extension
i
think,
not
as
great
in
the
extension
as
this
squire
versus
capoeman.
capoeman,
i
believe
went
off
on
the
proposition,
that
you
got
this
income
only
once
in
your
lifetime?
effectively
cutting
timber
was
not
like
farming.
farming
was
--
[voice
overlap]
mr.
slade
gorton
arguably,
squire
would
govern
that
case,
but
squire
certainly
doesn’t
govern
this
case.
this
isn’t
income
from
land.
mr.
slade
gorton
it’s
from
transactions.
there’s
no
way
that
these
taxes
can
be
construed
to
be
property
taxes.
it
is
simply
aren’t
property
taxes
in
any
respect
whatsoever
and
it
is
only
property
taxes
or
taxes
which
have
construed
to
be
property
taxes
of
which
this
court
has
ever
exempted
in
the
indian
farms
except
in
warren
trading
which
itself
was
based
on
a
specific
statute.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
first
assertion
in
this
court
that
an
individual
indian
citizen
may
engage
in
a
private
commercial
venture
literally,
any
private
commercial
venture
in
direct
competition
with
other
citizens
of
the
state
or
for
that
matter
even
with
other
indians
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
been
declared
competent
or
to
have
moved
off
the
reservation
with
paying
or
collecting
any
of
the
excise
taxes
applicable
to
all
such
businesses
on
an
equal
basis
conducted
by
other
citizens
of
the
state.
it
involves
a
claim
of
a
right
literally
to
destroy
those
other
competing
businesses,
a
claim,
which
is
asserted
again
by
a
citizen
entitled
by
the
constitution
to
every
right
and
privilege
extended
by
the
state
to
every
other
citizen.
the
factual
setting
and
which
this
claim
arrives
is
this.
the
colville
reservation
is
not
an
isolated
track
in
the
state
of
washington
occupied
only
by
indians.
nor
for
that
matter
are
the
amicus
reservations.
they
lie
close
tacoma,
to
olympia,
to
seattle
and
the
various
other
major
metropolitan
areas
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
colville
is
this
very
large
one
here.
the
amicus
are
here,
here,
here
and
here.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
getting
to
the
city,
which
is
partly
on
the
colville
reservation
right
now.
the
colville
reservation
under
the
1970
census
figures
has
1,779
indian
inhabitants
and
2,429
or
58%
non-indian
inhabitants
on
the
reservation.
this
is
a
bia
map,
the
upper
right
hand
corner
shows
the
entire
reservation,
which
is
in
yellow
on
the
other
map.
this
section
is
the
northwest
corner
of
the
map.
the
city
of
omak,
washington
incidentally
both
our
briefs
and
the
other
briefs
are
in
error
in
speaking
of
the
city
called
east
omak.
there
is
simply
in
washington
a
city
of
omak,
washington,
which
lies
on
both
sides
of
the
okanogan
river,
which
is
the
boundary
of
the
colville
reservation
and
roughly
this
portion
of
the
reservation
is
inside
the
city
of
omak.
the
white
areas
on
this
map
are
allotted
indian
lands.
the
park
outline
in
red
is
where
the
particular
cigarette
sales
of
mr.
tonasket
take
place.
green
are
tribal
lands
both
white
and
green
are
therefore
restricted
in
the
terms
that
have
been
used
here
for
the
last
two
days.
the
yellow
lands
are
those
lands
on
this
part
of
the
indian
reservation
only,
which
have
been
patented
and
which
are
therefore
subject
to
taxation.
most
of
which
have
probably
been
sold
to
non-indians,
but
even
if
they
are
still
retained
by
indians,
those
yellows
lands
on
the
reservation
do
not
support
the
peculiar
claims
for
their
owners,
which
the
appellant
makes
here
for
his
land.
which
is
still
restricted
as
far
as
alienation
and
taxation
is
concerned.
this
portion,
which
is
the
upper
part
of
this
section
(a),
is
in
the
city
of
omak.
some
tribal
land,
some
allotted
land,
a
larger
amount
of
patented
land.
mr.
slade
gorton
just
over
4000
people
and
it
is
the
largest
city
on
the
reservation
--
the
city
of
okanogan,
which
is
the
county
city
has
about
half
that
number.
there
are
several
other
incorporated
towns
on
or
immediately
adjacent
to
that
reservation.
it’s
not
until
you
get
to
the
amicus
tribes
that
you
get
to
the
extremely
large
cities
of
the
state
of
washington
or
their
immediate
area.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
only
section
does
not
concern
you
here.
this
is
just
that
if
we’re
off
the
reservation.
the
point,
mr.
justice
douglas
is
that
on
reservations
in
the
state
of
washington
not
just
the
colville
reservation.
this
is
a
very
typical
pattern.
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
situation
the
navajos
described
yesterday
where
indian
country
is
simply
[voice

mr.
slade
gorton
there
are
maybe
a
few
of
the
(inaudible).
mr.
slade
gorton
oh!
yes,
they
do
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
city
of
toppenish
is
entirely
located
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
yakima.
mr.
slade
gorton
patented
land.
mr.
slade
gorton
much
land
on
the
yakima
reservation
has
been
patented.
not
the
upper
parts
of
the
reservation
in
the
rural
areas.
mr.
slade
gorton
where
the
--
where
wapato
and
toppenish
of
that
area
is
mostly
patented
land.
though,
again
there
is
a
mixture
as
there
is
here.
there’s
land
retained
by
indians
even
down
there.
moreover,
there’s
one
other
point,
far
from
all
of
the
indians
on
the
colville
--
in
the
colville
tribe
live
on
the
reservation.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
between
half
and
three
quarters
of
them
leave
off
the
reservation
add
to
that
number,
those
indians
living
on
patented
lands
on
the
reservation
and
it’s
clear
that
the
extraordinary
privileges
claimed
by
appellant
are
likely
to
be
available
only
to
a
capriciously
fortunate
minority
of
colville
or
other
indians.
and
it’s
this
integration
in
these
reservations,
which
gives
rise
to
the
importance
of
this
case.
indeed,
i
think
to
its
very
existence
and
presence
before
you.
it’s
this
integration,
i
believe,
which
accounts
for
the
fact
that
until
a
last-ditch
effort
to
show
up
appellant’s
claim
to
tax
exemption
last
spring.
the
federal
indian
trader
act
was
simply
unused
in
the
state
of
washington
except
on
two
isolated
coastal
reservations.
they
were
all
together.
they
shop
in
the
same
store
as
whether
they
were
indian
or
non-indians.
now,
the
approach
of
congress
to
indian
tax
exemptions
has
been
to
set
out
post
exemptions
explicitly
by
statute.
mr.
cohen’s
treaties
are
written
for
that
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
which
was
quoted
here
yesterday.
it
says,
“indeed,
such
exemptions
as
apply
to
specific
federal
or
state
taxes
on
the
income
of
indians
or
on
their
property
must
be
found
then
or
derived
from
statutes
and
treaties
or
agreements
with
the
indian
tribes.”
the
approach
of
this
court
for
many
years
has
been
identical.
it
has
based
successful
exemption
claims
only
on
specific
acts
of
congress
and
not
since
the
demise
of
implied
governmental
immunity
34
years
ago
in
the
helvering
case
on
general
philosophical
concepts.
now,
appellants
first
and
chief
claim
to
a
statutory
exemption
is
based
on
the
indian
trader
act
and
this
court’s
decision
in
warren
trading
post.
the
exemption,
which
this
court
found
there
was
limited
specifically
and
cautiously
and
by
its
expressed
terms
to
sales
by
a
license
indian
trader
to
indians,
a
class
of
sales
of
cigarettes
which
washington
statutes
themselves
exempt
at
the
present
time.
the
indian
trader
act,
the
first
section
of
which
is
25
u.s.c.
261
speaks
directly
of
sales
to
indians.
in
fact,
should
the
sec
--
should
the
act
be
construed
to
apply
to
sales
by
indians
to
non-indians.
section
262
and
264
clearly
require
each
non-indian
purchaser
to
obtain
an
indian
trader’s
license,
to
go
and
buy
these
cigarettes.
the
absurdity
of
this
result
indicates
the
absurdity
of
appellant’s
claim
that
he
is
exempted
by
the
indian
trader
act
from
a
general
non-discriminatory
excise
tax
on
his
sales
to
non-indians.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
will
certainly
get
to
that
what
i
consider
to
be
a
philosophical
point
because
we
will
claim
that
warren
trading
post
is
not
applicable
to
the
state
of
washington
because
of
pl
83-280.
the
point
i'm
making
now
is
that
those
cigarettes
which
we
actually
our
attempting
to
tax.
i
think
that
exemption
may
have
come
into
existence
since
the
--
this
since
is
rather
--
this
case
has
gone
a
long
time
since
it
came
into
existence.
but
the
point
that
we’re
arguing
for
here
is
solely
the
proposition
of
sales
to
non-indians.
we
are
not
now
trying
to
impose
a
cigarette
tax
on
indians.
we
would
claim
under
pl
280
that
we
could
if
we
wish,
but
we
are
not
trying
to
do
that
now
in
this
case.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
did
not
argue
the
case
and
the
state
supreme
court.
i
think
mr.
pirtle
statement
yesterday
was
right
that
the
distinction
was
made
in
the
supreme
court
argument.
it
was
not
made
by
our
state
supreme
court.
in
any
event,
it’s
conscious
of
our
state
statutes
in
the
exemption
which
they
provide
not
just
for
sales
by
red
license
indian
traders,
but
simply
sales
to
non-indians
by
any
indians
tribe
or
through
any
indian
tribe.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
your
honor
i
am.
to
the
contrary
of
the
position
of
even
the
solicitor
of
much
less
the
appellants,
that
act
doesn’t
--
was
designed
to
close
the
cigarette
tax
loopholes
against
indians.
the
same
legislature,
which
passed
that
statute,
passed
a
conditional
appropriations
act
of
$8
million
based
on
the
usefulness
of
that
act
in
closing
of
these
indian
cigarettes
sales.
in
october
this
year
for
example,
the
loss
to
the
state
from
indian
cigarettes
sales
of
taxes
alone
was
--
cigarette
taxes
alone
was
well
over
$600,000.
that
act
by
its
terms
simply
says
that
the
state
will
no
longer
engage
in
useless
acts.
this
court
has
recognized
--
the
court
has
recognized
that
a
state
can’t
collect
an
excise
tax
from
the
purchaser
after
he
has
made
a
purchase
and
distribute
it
himself
to
his
home.
an
excise
tax
like
this
has
got
to
be
collected
to
the
seller
to
be
collected
at
all.
there
was
an
error
in
fact
in
the
argument
yesterday
about
competing
cigarette
taxes.
our
tax
is
16
cents,
oregon’s
tax
is
9
cents,
idaho’s
tax
is
9.1
cents,
but
this
does
mean
that
people
will
try
to
get
away
from
taxes
when
they
can.
that’s
why
these
people
are
selling
cigarettes.
what
this
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no
sir,
it
does
not.
it
allows
the
possession
by
any
one
for
use
of
two
cartons
of
cigarettes.
mr.
slade
gorton
no
sir,
it
does
not
exempt
any
sale.
it
does
not
exempt
any
sale
if
there
interpretation
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
does
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
says,
solely
and
only
that
the
possession
of
two
cartons
of
cigarettes
at
a
time
is
not
subject
to
a
tax.
it
does
not
allow
anyone
to
sell
cigarettes
even
two
cartons
much
less
to
posses
400
or
500.
it
is
design
solely
to
prevent
the
theoretical
application
to
allot
to
someone
who
buys
two
cartons
of
cigarettes.
mr.
slade
gorton
it’s
--
the
act
is
clear.
the
act
--
that
portion
of
the
act
is
absolutely
clear
that
exemption
applies
only
to
possession
and
never
to
sale.
not
to
the
sale
of
a
single
cigarette
and
it’s
like
many
--
mr.
slade
gorton
possession
by
any
purpose
for
purposes
other
than
resale.
this
what
the
statute
says,
if
acquired
and
possessed
for
purposes
other
than
resale
400
or
less
cigarettes
at
any
single
time.
now,
this
appellant
is
out
of
that
for
two
reasons.
first,
of
course
he
obviously
has
more
than
400
cigarettes
at
the
time,
and
secondly,
he
holds
them
for
resale.
that’s
what
he’s
doing,
that’s
with
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
slade
gorton
to
the
effect
that
the
exemption
from
a
use
tax
which
we
just
couldn’t
collect
and
which
no
state
can
collect.
this
kind
of
exemption
i'm
sure
exists
in
many
state
excise
tax
statutes
where
you
don’t
--
it’s
impractical
to
try
to
make
a
criminal
out
of
the
purchaser.
you
must
collect
these
taxes
from
the
seller
or
you
can’t
collect
them
at
all.
now,
appellant’s
next
claim
to
a
statutory
exemption
from
these
particular
excise
taxes
is
based
on
section
6
of
the
general
allotment
act
is
applied
by
this
court
in
squire
versus
capoeman.
in
that
case,
chief
justice
warren
stated
that
income
from
a
timber
sale
from
mr.
capoeman’s
allotment.
the
sale
over
which
he
had
no
control
was
exempt
from
the
federal
tax
on
capital
gains.
this
court
found
the
sale
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
sale
of
the
land
itself.
the
finding
was
obviously
correct
and
equally
obviously
inapplicable
here.
timber
can
be
cut
from
land
such
as
mr.
capoeman’s,
literally
once
in
a
lifetime
or
less
and
the
land
that
was
found
by
the
court
had
little,
if
any
additional
value
so
that
the
proceeds
of
the
timber
sale
constituted
the
only
income
in
all
probability,
which
the
allotment
would
provide
for
mr.
capoeman
in
his
lifetime
and
amounted
for
his
purposes
were
concern
to
a
sale
of
the
whole
property.
he
had
control
over
neither
the
fact
nor
the
timing
of
the
sale.
mr.
tonasket’s
income
here
however
is
continuing.
it
is
neither
based
on
the
fruits
of
the
land
nor
on
its
exhaustion.
it
is
simple
business
income.
moreover,
mr.
capoeman’s
tax
exemption
had
no
adverse
effects
on
timber
sales
by
non-exempt
landowners.
mr.
tonasket’s
claim
on
the
other
hand,
if
upheld
can
and
will
destroy
the
businesses
of
competing
sellers
of
cigarettes
or
of
any
other
commodity,
which
mr.
tonasket
chooses
to
sell
at
retail.
finally,
it
seems
doubtful
that
mr.
tonasket’s
inevitable
claim
to
a
federal
income
tax
exemption
on
the
profits
of
his
sales
is
likely
to
have
much
appeal
to
this
court.
yet,
it
is
the
logical
corollary
of
the
extension
of
squire
versus
capoeman
to
a
situation
now
before
you,
which
was
certainly
not
in
the
minds
of
the
court
at
the
time
that
which
that
case
was
decided.
appellant’s
final
statutory
claim
to
exemption
is
based
on
section
4
of
pl
83-280
itself.
a
statute
designed
to
authorize
the
extension
of
state
jurisdiction
over
indian
reservations.
the
statute
itself
provides
that
it
shall
not
“authorize
the
encumbrance
or
taxation
of
any
real
or
personal
property
belonging
to
any
indian
that
is
subject
to
a
restriction
against
alienation
imposed
by
the
united
states”.
first
of
course,
that
statute
doesn’t
grant
any
tax
exemption.
it
simply
preserves
those
granted
by
other
statutes
from
encroachment
by
the
state.
moreover,
it
like
all
of
those
other
statutes
except
perhaps
the
indian
trader
act
deals
solely
with
property
taxation.
nothing
can
be
more
clear
from
the
decisions
this
court
and
for
that
matter
practically
every
other
court
in
the
land
then
the
distinction
between
property
and
non-property
taxes.
this
court
in
u.s.
v.
detroit
even
allowed
the
taxation
on
the
leasehold
interest
on
federal
lands
leased
to
private
persons.
the
cigarette
taxes
and
the
sales
taxes
here
in
question
are
in
no
way
property
taxes.
in
addition,
these
excise
taxes
have
two
distinguishing
features
not
shared
by
inheritance
taxes
involved
in
the
oklahoma
cases
or
for
that
matter
even
by
net
income
taxes.
first
of
course,
the
ultimate
burden
of
these
taxes
does
not
normally
rest
on
the
business
charge
with
paying
or
collecting
them.
they
are
passed
on
to
the
ultimate
purchaser
of
the
cigarettes
or
other
items
offered
for
sale
by
the
retailer.
in
fact,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
washington
state
law
requires
that
the
sales
tax
be
passed
on.
it
is
not
permitted
to
be
absorbed
by
the
retailer.
second
of
course,
appellant’s
claim
involves
the
right
to
destroy
all
of
his
competition
in
the
sale
of
cigarettes.
appellant
asserts
in
his
brief
that
the
3
cents
tax
by
the
colville
tribe
on
each
pack
if
added
to
the
state
16
cent
tax
will
wipe
out
his
ability
to
sell
cigarettes.
how
many
cigarettes
then
will
a
competitor
in
the
city
of
omak
without
appellant’s
claim
the
exemptions
sale
subject
to
a
16-cent
tax
in
competition
with
appellant’s
3
cents?
for
that
matter,
how
many
appliances
can
a
non-indian
businessman
in
omak
sell
on
which
he
must
charge
of
5%
sales
tax
in
competition
with
appellant
who
claims
the
right
to
sell
the
same
article
free
from
taxes?
for
that
matter,
referring
back
to
one
of
yesterday’s
cases,
can
a
similar
businessman
in
seattle
sells
cigarettes
or
appliances
in
competition
with
an
indian
seller
for
whom
that
bia
acquires
property
in
seattle
under
the
claim
of
right
asserted
here
yesterday
by
the
appellant
in
skelera
(ph).
please
remember
that
this
appellant
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
washington
entitled
to
the
rights
of
every
other
citizen
including
police
protection,
schools,
and
every
other
state
and
local
governmental
service.
nor
is
this
a
theoretical
entitlement.
all
state
and
local
governmental
services
are
actually
extended
to
indians
by
washington
state
often
that
a
per
capital
cost
to
the
state
in
excess
of
that
to
the
average
of
non-indians.
in
point
of
fact,
we
can
at
least
asked
the
rhetorical
question
whether
congress
could
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
require
us
first
in
1924
to
have
all
indians
as
citizens
and
then
say
that
they
should
pay
no
taxes
at
all
and
this
arises
in
these
cases
not
an
income
tax
cases
or
inheritance
tax
cases,
which
affect
only
the
state.
but
in
this
case
which
affects
other
citizens
of
the
state
and
their
ability
to
do
business.
now,
at
this
point
except
in
passing,
i
haven’t
mentioned
pl
83-280
for
what
i
consider
to
be
good
reason.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
extended
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
to
impose
cigarette
sales
taxes,
cigarette
taxes,
and
sales
taxes
in
colville
reservation.
because
the
state
already
had
that
right,
but
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
jurisdiction,
it
is
surely
dispelled
by
pl
83-280.
and
that
statute
is
relevant
in
connection
with
the
one
point
in
this
case
and
which
the
solicitor
general
asserts
the
possession,
sales
of
cigarettes
to
indians
which
are
tax-exempt
under
the
doctrine
of
warren
trading
post
in
the
absence
of
pl
83-280.
now,
appellant
has
labored
long
in
this
murky
legislative
history
of
pl
83-280
without
i
submit
producing
a
shred
of
evidence
that
it
was
intended
to
bar
these
taxes.
he
asserts
that
the
law
does
nothing
more
than
to
extend
state
court
jurisdiction.
the
statute
help
--
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
justice
douglas,
governor
evans
is
a
good
personal
friend
of
mine,
but
he
is
not
a
lawyer
and
he
is
clearly
in
error
in
that
statement.
that
indian
cigarette
tax
statute
is
clear
on
its
face
and
it
just
simply
does
not
legitimize
such
sales
and
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
is
from
reading
that
statute
which
is
the
place
where
one
will
normally
go
to
determining
its
meaning.
mr.
slade
gorton
to
sell
to
indians,
your
honor.
if
you
will
read
the
titles
82,
24
and
28,
this
is
what
my
answer
was
here.
this
has
been
a
case.
this
was
a
case
before
1972.
the
1972
statute
did
not
extend
any
right
to
sell
by
indians
to
indians
which
didn’t
previously
exist
in
our
statute.
that
was
already
there
--
the
1972
act
added
the
provision
in
this
particular
respect
not
with
the
person,
this
is
any
person
may
acquire
and
to
physically
possess
if
acquired
and
declared
and
possessed
for
purposes
other
than
resale
“for
purposes
other
than
resale”
400
or
less
cigarettes
in
any
single
time
without
incurring
tax
liability
and
that
was
the
only
addition,
which
was
made
by
the
statute,
which
is
relevant
to
this
particular
question.
mr.
slade
gorton
in
the
1972
session
of
state
legislation.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
no
way,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
there’s
other
legislative
history
of
this
act,
which
indicates
that
the
legislature
felt
that
it
was
closing
an
$8
million
per
loophole
by
passing
this
act
in
imposing
the
cigarette
tax
on
the
--
at
the
moment
the
cigarettes
came
in
to
the
state
and
before
even
arrived
on
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
would
be
--
that
would
govern.
mr.
slade
gorton
if
it
had,
it
is
if
you’re
correct
that
my
position
is
that
it
is
not
construable
that’s
clear
on
its
face,
but
this
--
mr.
slade
gorton
your
honor,
we
have
--
mr.
slade
gorton
you’re
asking
me
to
testify
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor
[laughter].
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
well,
not
when
you
ask
me
what
governor
evans
was
advised
your
honor.
[laughter]
my
point
in
this
particular
case
though,
is
that
that
is
essentially
a
useless
act.
you
have
this
case
in
all
of
its
panoply
before
you.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
because
you
will
get
an
inevitable
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
slade
gorton
edit
the
state
taxing
statute.
now,
if
you
feel
in
an
excess
of
caution
that
you
wish
to
do
that,
you
nonetheless
have
the
right
and
i
believe
this
is
the
right
time
to
construe
[voice
overlap].
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
i
suppose
my
answer
to
that
has
to
be
that
you
are
at
least
as
capable
of
reading
a
statute
as
our
state
supreme
court
is
and
when
we
[voice
overlap].
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
you
have
two
other
cases
here
in
front
of
you
which
involved
at
least
some
of
the
same
questions
except
for
the
effect
of
pl
83-280.
you
were
asked
yesterday
by
appellant
to
send
that
back
to
our
supreme
court
to
determine
whether
it
was
correctly
passed.
our
supreme
court
already
ruled
on
that,
so
as
our
federal
district
court,
so
as
our
ninth
circuit
court.
that
too
would
be
frivolous
act.
those
cases
are
already
in
our
–-
cited
in
our
briefs.
we
have
a
case
here
on
federal
law,
on
federal
questions,
which
is
right
then
which
is
before
you.
on
those
federal
questions
and
under
which
you
don’t
need
to
get
to
this.
this
man
by
his
complaint
is
engaged
in
this
resale
of
cigarettes.
that’s
a
plain
term,
that’s
what
his
business
is
--
the
resale
of
cigarettes.
forever,
[voice
overlap].
mr.
slade
gorton
if
the
state
statute
is
ambiguous
and
if
it
controls
your
decision
in
the
case,
you
would
have
to.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
that
that
is
essential
in
the
case,
your
honor.
as
long
as
you
decide
that
this
case
would
be
governed
by
a
state
statute
even
if
that
we’re
construed
the
other
way.
what
if
it
was
construed
to
allow
someone
to
possess
and
resale
two
cartons
of
cigarettes,
which
is
all
they
claim
for.
still
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
person
here
who
buys
and
resale
two
cartons
of
cigarettes.
this
is
a
big
business.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
will
not
help
mr.
tonasket
who
is
not
a
purchaser
and
seller
of
two
cartons
of
cigarettes
under
any
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
there
are
many
ways
to
i
which
they
can
take
a
contrary
to
mine,
your
honor.
they
could
say
that
a
person
may
sell
two
cartons
of
cigarettes
in
an
isolated
sale
without
being
subject
to
the
statute.
that
would
be
contrary
to
my
view,
but
that
wouldn’t
help
mr.
tonasket.
he
is
a
commercial
seller
of
cigarettes.
he
doesn’t
buy
two
cartons
of
cigarettes
and
sell
them
to
a
particular
friend
and
then
go
buy
two
more
and
sell
them
to
a
friend.
he
is
engaged
in
a
commercial
enterprise
in
competition
with
those
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
solicitor
general
did,
but
the
solicitor
general
i
will
submit
in
this
particular
case
totally
misconstrued
if
the
[voice

mr.
slade
gorton
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
unless,
you
can
say
for
his
construction
was
the
one
that
we’ve
--
i
discussed
here
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
have,
yes
and
excuse
me,
the
sales
tax
issue
is
still
here
with
you.
the
fact
that
the
sales
taxes
applicable
to
these
sales
and
that
this
particular
claimant,
claims
the
right
to
sell
this
article
and
other
articles
free
from
the
state
sales
tax,
which
includes
no
such
exemption
in
it.
so,
in
any
event,
you
have
that
matter
before
you.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes
your
honor,
i
was
and
it
was
in
that
connection
that
this
so-called
new
legislative
history
was
brought
up
and
sent
to
us
about
10
days
ago.
and
we
on
monday,
found
something
in
the
file,
which
we’re
not
supplied
by
the
solicitor
general.
a
letter
from
the
assistant
secretary
to
the
interior
to
the
house
committee,
the
original
bill
in
1953
hr10-63
included
only
the
language
on
jurisdiction
over
civil
causes
of
action
in
this
particular
respect.
the
secretary
suggested
the
language
in
which
the
bill
actually
passed
and
said
this
that
it
was
to
extend
to
those
reservations
the
substantive
civil
laws
of
the
state
in
so
far,
as
these
laws
are
of
general
application
to
private
persons
or
private
property.
anyone
on
the
call
for
the
preservation
on
indian
law
were
not
inconsistent
with
applicable
state
laws
to
assure
“the
predominance
of
state
authority”.
now,
can
anyone
seriously
assert
that
the
state
excise
tax
laws
are
not
substantive
civil
laws
of
general
application?
to
state
that
question
is
simply
to
answer
it.
mr.
slade
gorton
precisely
and
that
is
what
congress
did
mr.
chief
justice
in
pl-280.
it
accepted
the
property
taxes
on
allotted
lands,
it
accepted
to
a
certain
extent
indian
laws
where
they
want
inconsistent
with
state
law.
that’s
why
it
was
not
a
termination
act.
the
same
congress
passed
a
group
of
termination
acts.
they
wiped
out
the
indian
tribes
as
entities.
the
existence
of
their
reservations
and
property
tax
exemptions,
this
was
not
a
termination
act,
but
it
was
an
act
which
says
that
except
where
we
have
said
specifically
to
the
contrary,
the
state
has
all
jurisdictions.
you
just
can’t
get
any
clearer,
actually
it’s
a
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
would
be
an
extension
i
think,
not
as
great
in
the
extension
as
this
squire
versus
capoeman.
capoeman,
i
believe
went
off
on
the
proposition,
that
you
got
this
income
only
once
in
your
lifetime?
effectively
cutting
timber
was
not
like
farming.
farming
was
--
[voice
overlap]
mr.
slade
gorton
arguably,
squire
would
govern
that
case,
but
squire
certainly
doesn’t
govern
this
case.
this
isn’t
income
from
land.
mr.
slade
gorton
it’s
from
transactions.
there’s
no
way
that
these
taxes
can
be
construed
to
be
property
taxes.
it
is
simply
aren’t
property
taxes
in
any
respect
whatsoever
and
it
is
only
property
taxes
or
taxes
which
have
construed
to
be
property
taxes
of
which
this
court
has
ever
exempted
in
the
indian
farms
except
in
warren
trading
which
itself
was
based
on
a
specific
statute.
