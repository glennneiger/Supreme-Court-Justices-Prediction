justice

is
this
case
involved
in
a
claim
by
the
state
of
washington
only
of
the
power
to
collect
the
taxes
on
sales
to
non-indians
or
does
it
involve
the
claim
generally
on
all
sales?
i
couldn’t
--
i
wasn’t
sure
of
that
after
reading
the
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
understood
to
say.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
what
caused
my
confusion.
justice
potter
stewart
today,
in
the
proceeding
on
the
premise
around
the
hypothesis
that
280
is
in
effect
in
the
state
of
washington,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
my
understanding.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
you’re
conceding
on
the
hypothesis
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
the
arguendo.
that’s
just
you’re
making
the
assumption
that
it
is
without
conceding
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
just
you
said
about
that,
said
you
may
apply
your
taxes
when
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
just
curious
mr.
pirtle,
this
is
why
a
committee
hearing
so
recent
as
1953
should
be
locked
up
in
the
archives
and
available
only
by
special
permission.
