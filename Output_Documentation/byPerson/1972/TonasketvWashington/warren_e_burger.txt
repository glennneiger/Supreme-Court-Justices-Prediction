mr.
pirtle,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
buying
a
carton
of
cigarettes,
an
indian
selling
a
carton
to
another
indian
is
commerce
within
the
indian
tribe,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington
was
this
argument
made
as
a
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
sales
or
was
it
just
an
all-or-nothing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
was
if
the
states
might
have
a
comparable
reaction
if
they
are
deprived
of
tax
revenues,
isn’t
that
possible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ziontz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
we’ll
resume
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
arguments
in
71-1031,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
it
in
effect
an
exemption
from
a
use
tax
that
would
otherwise
[voice
overlap]?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
--
when
argued
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
federal
statute
and
what
we
can
really
lay
aside
the
state
statute,
were
you
addressing
yourself
to
the
said
part
of
section
280
that
provides
that
the
state
has
jurisdiction
over
everything
that
applies
to
all
other
people
in
the
state
of
washington?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
when
they
seek
to
have
all
the
benefits
of
citizenship
and
the
protection
of
the
substantive
law
then
they
take
with
that
the
burden
a
tax
except
as
congress
or
the
state
expressly
exempts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
pirtle,
we
will
enlarge
your
time
little
bit
because
we
have
gone
over
with
a
lot
of
questions.
so,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
does
section
280
mean
when
it
says
as
to
civil
jurisdiction
the
states
after
they
have
gone
under
280
will
have
jurisdiction
over
civil
cases.
and
to
the
same
extents
and
this
is
the
general
part
to
the
same
extent
that
such
state
has
jurisdiction
over
other
several
causes
of
action
and
those
civil
laws
of
such
state
that
are
of
general
application
to
private
in
persons
and
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you’ve
indicated
that
perhaps,
there
might
be
some
ambiguity
in
280
in
the
passage
that
are
i
was
reading.
but
the
committee
report
on
that
after
some
preliminaries
about
the
efforts
to
draw
all
indians
into
the
total
culture
goes
on
to
say
that
it
extends
to
those
reservations
the
substantive
civil
laws
of
the
respective
states.
now,
do
you
say
that
substantive
civil
laws
do
not
include
the
tax
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
i
want
to
read
the
rest
of
the
sentence.
substantive
civil
laws
of
the
respective
states
in
so
far
as
those
laws
are
general
application
to
the
private
persons
or
private
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now,
isn’t
the
tax
on
sales?
doesn’t
that
have
something
to
do
with
private
persons
and
private
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
that
do
any
more
than
preserve
the
exemptions
which
congress
had
already
explicitly
extended
to
indian
lands?
it’s
a
saving
clause,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
what
went
way
off
from
cigarettes,
cartons
of
cigarettes,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up
now

chief
justice
warren
e.

you

the

is
