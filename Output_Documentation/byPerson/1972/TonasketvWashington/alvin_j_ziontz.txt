mr.
alvin
j.
ziontz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
tax
case
but
we
see
it
in
a
larger
context.
we
see
the
case
and
i
say,
we
are
speaking
as
counsel
for
the
colville
confederated
tribes
and
amicus
tribes
as
a
case
involving
essential
aspects
of
indian
tribal
sovereignty.
a
concept
which
we
think
is
long
overdue
for
revitalization
by
this
court.
and
i
would
point
out
certain
basic
principles
that
i
think
in
here,
in
this
case.
first,
i
think
it’s
necessary
to
start
with
the
principle
that
indian
tribes
are
sui
generis
because
of
the
special
aspects
of
their
position
and
i
would
point
out
five
special
aspects
that
apply
here.
we
deal
with
a
group
of
people,
first
of
all,
of
specific
ancestry
with
a
special
historic
relationship
to
the
united
states
and
a
relationship
which
involves
a
national
honor.
secondly,
the
people
occupy
their
own
land
area,
an
area
with
established
boundaries
reserved
from
non-indian
encroachment.
this
was
the
basic
purpose
of
the
united
states
in
establishing
that
reservation
and
guaranteed
to
the
indians
by
the
united
states,
a
guarantee
given
before
creation
of
state
government
and
looking
towards
the
future
encirclement
of
the
reservation
by
state
government.
thirdly,
the
lands
and
the
income
from
the
lands
are
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states.
a
very
significant
legal
factor
because
it
is
the
foundation
for
the
fiduciary
relationship.
that
is
to
say
the
united
states
is
trustee
of
lands
for
its
indian
beneficiaries.
this
does
not
necessarily
depend
on
any
guardian
ward
principle.
fourth,
a
tribal
government
functioning
over
that
territory
according
to
a
tribal
constitution
which
was
submitted
to
the
united
states
and
given
approval
by
the
united
states.
and
finally,
the
land,
the
people
and
their
government
are
all
subject
to
the
plenary
power
of
congress
and
all
under
the
tutelage
of
the
united
states.
now,
given
these
factors
which
are
present
here
and
i
think
distinguished
away
the
oklahoma
cases
and
(inaudible).
we
have
clearly
in
tribal
sovereignty
aspect.
tribal
sovereignty
does
not
derive
from
congress.
congress
did
not
grant
the
tribes
their
inherent
power
of
self-government.
congress
may
restrict
it.
congress
may
destroy
it
but
unless
congress
has
done
so,
that
sovereignty
prevails.
an
essential
element
of
that
sovereignty
is
taxing
power.
the
federal
policy
towards
these
tribal
governments
is
undeniable.
it
is
the
strength
of
them.
it
is
to
preserve
them,
its
institutions.
congress
has
reached
the
decision
that
this
is
a
way
for
progress
to
be
achieved
for
the
indian
people.
the
indian
people
have
accepted
that
in
issue.
they
responded
to
it.
they
were
vitally
involved
in
the
affairs
of
their
tribe.
educated
indians
are
participating
in
their
tribal
government.
indians
who
have
served
in
the
military,
come
back
to
the
reservations
and
have
run
for
office
and
are
participating
in
tribal
affairs.
this
is
a
viable,
important
concept
which
should
not
be
glossed
over
in
the
concern
between
congress
and
the
states.
now,
state
of
washington
here,
although
it
argues
that
public
law
280
give
jurisdiction
of
taxes
tribe,
insists
that
even
without
280,
it
has
some
kind
of
residual
jurisdiction
that
it
could’ve
imposed
this
tax
and
in
fact
does
impose
the
cigarette
tax
over
all
tribes
in
the
state
of
washington,
quite
apart
from
280.
now,
there
are
identified
at
least
six
basic
principles
in
the
cases
that
bar
the
state,
bar
any
state
from
imposing
any
state
taxes
on
a
tribe
which
meets
all
these
qualifications.
there
is,
i
say
first
of
all,
the
concept
of
tribal
sovereignty.
secondly,
in
the
case
of
the
colville
tribes,
tribal
preemption,
the
tribe
has,
subsequent
to
the
arrest
of
mr.
tonasket,
passed
its
own
statute.
that
statute
is
entitled
to
recognition.
in
state
ex
rel.
turtle
versus
merrill,
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
that
a
tribe
which
validly
legislates,
preempts
the
field
and
a
state
may
not
impair
that
legislation.
and
it
should
be
noted
that
washington
law
provides
and
the
attorney
general
has
interpreted
the
law
to
mean
that
wherever
the
state
has
jurisdiction,
it
is
exclusive.
there
is
no
concurrent
tribal
jurisdiction.
it
ousts
the
tribal
jurisdiction
entirely
and
particularly
in
the
field
of
excise
tax.
if
washington
state
law
applies
in
toto,
then
there
is
not
an
integrum
left
for
tribal
law.
a
third
bar
to
the
extension
of
the
state
taxes
is
the
so-called
infringement
test
and
i
suggest
that
one
deserves
careful
attention
because
surely
there
should
be
some
guidelines
about
what
as
to
what
kind
of
factual
showing
needs
to
be
made
at
the
trial
level
before
the
court
can
conclude
that
there
is
or
is
not
infringement.
this
should
not
be
a
judicial
obstruction.
fourth
is
the
doctrine
of
federal
instrumentality.
i
wouldn’t
elaborate
on
that.
that’s
a
familiar
doctrine.
fifth
is
the
doctrine
of
federal
preemption
and
the
trader
statute
has
been
held
to
be
a
federal
preemption
of
indian
commerce.
and
finally
is
the
doctrine
of
federal
policy.
state
laws
cannot
invade
an
area
which
is
contrary
to
or
impedes
a
congressional
policy.
280
has
been
urged
by
the
state
as
giving
it
cart
blanche
to
assert
this
tax
liability
on
the
indians
of
the
colville
reservation.
i
submit
that
280
does
not
assist
the
state
in
its
position.
280
clearly
reserves
out
from
state
jurisdiction,
the
traditional
tax
immunity
of
indians.
i
submit
the
exclusion
statute,
exclusion
section,
must
be
read
as
preserving
all
prior
law.
see
kirkwood
versus
arenas
which
held
to
that
effect.
in
summary,
i
would
say
that
the
court
in
1953,
congress
was
attempting
to
achieve
several
inconsistent
goals
and
the
lack
of
hearings
perhaps
attest
to
the
fact
that
a
statute
was
not
drawn
with
the
care
that
it
should’ve
been
drawn
with.
on
the
one
hand,
it
wanted
to
replace
the
jurisdictional
tangle
with
the
uniform
system
of
state
law
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
also
wanted
to
preserve
indian
tribes
on
their
territorial
base.
a
careful
examination
of
the
statute
shows
an
unmistakable
congressional
attempt
to
keep
the
state
out
of
areas
involving
the
use
of
trust
property.
there’s
clearly
no
more
direct
example
of
use
of
trust
property
than
an
indian
conducting
a
grocery
store
on
his
allotment
on
the
reservation.
the
federal
policy
looks
towards
indians
developing
their
lands
in
non-agricultural,
non-natural
resource
ways,
in
getting
into
business.
i
believe
that
on
behalf
of
the
tribes,
this
court
deserves
to
--
the
doctrine
of
tribal
sovereignty
deserves
careful
examination.
it
is
a
third
factor
in
this
three-way
fight
between
the
tribes,
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
thank
you.
mr.
alvin
j.
ziontz
mr.
chief
justice,
may

this
is
a
