mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issue
presented
by
the
case
is
the
following:
when
the
government
condemns
land
for
public
project,
must
it
pay
for
the
value
added
to
the
land
by
a
permit
to
graze
cattle
on
adjacent
public
land,
and
i
can
refine
that
one
step
further;
when
that
permit
is
admittedly
a
revocable
permit
that
the
government
can
revoke
without
payment
of
compensation.
the
factual
situation
in
which
the
case
arose
is
the
following:
government
determined
that
it
was
necessary
to
build
a
dam
as
a
flood-control
project
on
the
bill
williams
river
in
arizona,
an
area
that
is
subject
to
flash
floods.
mr.
fuller
owned
three
tracts
of
land
in
the
vicinity
of
this
project.
it
was
the
total
--
about
1,280
acres.
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
take
two
of
those
tracts
that
totaled
920
acres.
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
take
the
third
and
third
tract
was
not
taken.
in
connection
with
his
land,
mr.
fuller
for
a
number
of
years
had
been
using
30,000
acres
of
federal
grazing
land
to
graze
his
cattle
in
it.
he
used
that
land
under
permit
issued
under
section
5
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
of
1934.
section
5
permit,
now,
i
will
talk
about
in
a
little
more
detail
later,
is
a
revocable
permit
that
by
statute
does
not
create
any
right,
title
or
interest
in
the
public
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
term
is
not
stated
in
the
statue
except
that
it
cannot
exceed
10
years
as
an
administrative
regulation
and
practice.
the
permits
are
issued
year
by
year.
the
permit
has
to
be
reissued
each
year.
they
are
customarily
reissued
to
the
same
person
and
had
them
the
year
before,
but
the
permit
is
for
one
year.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
--
i
think
there
is
a
formal
procedure
for
termination
and
to
this
extent
that
if
a
man
applies
for
the
permit
for
a
second
year
and
the
government
determines
not
to
grant
the
permit
the
second
year,
the
government
will
allow
him
to
--
it
will
state
its
reasons
why
the
permits
not
being
granted
and
will
allow
him
to
state
his
reasons
why
he
thinks
the
permit
should
be
granted.
it's
not
--
the
government
won’t
deny
a
permit
just
out
of
hand,
but
the
permits
are
revocable
and
often
when
the
property
is
needed
for
another
purpose
or
the
property
hasn’t
been
properly
used
are
revoked.
now,
there’s
a
peculiarity
of
this
case
that
needs
to
be
kept
in
mind.
the
government
did
not
revoke
mr.
fuller’s
grazing
permit
when
it
took
these
two
tracts
of
land.
the
reason
it
didn’t
do
so
is
that
it
didn’t
take
his
third
tract
of
land
and
he
was
free
to
continue
to
use
this
permit
in
connection
with
the
third
tract
of
land.
in
arizona,
the
basis
for
having
a
grazing
permit
is
having
sufficient
water
for
the
cattle
that
roam
on
the
federal
land
to
use
on
the
private
land
and
he
had
sufficient
water
apparently
on
his
third
tract
of
land
and
so
far
as
we
know,
mr.
fuller
is
still
using
this
permit.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it’s
interior.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
it
has
not
done
so
as
far
as
i
understand.
actually,
part
of
what
brings
this
case
here
is
that
the
department
of
the
interior
has
been
very
generous
with
the
use
of
this
land
because
if
the
department
of
interior
had
revoked
his
use
of
the
30,000
acres
of
public
land
before
it
took
the
land
in
question,
at
least
according
to
the
jurisprudence
in
the
courts
of
appeal,
up
to
this
point,
there
wouldn't
have
been
no
question
at
all
that
he
would
have
had
no
right
to
ask
the
jury
to
evaluate
his
use
of
the
public
land
along
with
his
use
of
his
private
land
and
it’s
our
contention
that
it’s
just
nonsense
to
say
that
this
revocable
permit
creating
less
than
a
property
right
and
the
public
land
that
could
have
been
revoked;
gives
him
a
right
to
additional
compensation
because
the
government
chose
not
to
revoke
it.
if
the
government
now
took
his
next
piece
of
land,
the
third
of
piece
of
land,
under
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
government
would
have
to
pay
again
for
the
same
permit.
now,
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
mr.
fuller
relied
heavily
on
the
number
of
cows
that
could
be
grazed
on
his
land
plus
the
public
land
and
obtained
an
instruction
from
the
trial
judge
that
the
jury
could
take
into
account
his
use
of
the
public
land
and
giving
him
compensation
for
his
private
land
so
long
as
it
also
took
into
account
the
fact
that
the
public
land
was
held
under
revocable
permits
that
those
permits
could
be
revoked
without
payment
of
compensation.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
$350,000
for
the
920
acres
of
ranch
land
that
was
taken
and
the
government
appealed.
the
ninth
circuit
divided
on
the
case.
the
majority
held
that
because
the
permit
had
not
been
revoked
distinguishing
this
from
the
situation
with
permit
had
already
been
revoked,
he
had
a
right
to
get
the
value
of
the
public
land
along
with
the
value
of
his
private
land
and
i
should
say
that
more
accurately.
he
had
a
right
in
determining
the
value
of
his
private
land
to
have
added
to
that
any
special
value
provided
by
the
use
of
the
public
land.
the
court
was
at
pains
to
distinguish
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
versus
rands
which
in
a
rather
similar
situation
had
held
exactly
to
the
contrary.
the
man
had
private
land
along
a
river
and
had
a
special
value
added
to
that
land
by
its
possible
uses
of
port
site
that
the
government
in
taking
the
land
would
not
have
to
pay
the
special
port
site
value
that
was
added.
the
dissenting
judge
found
that
the
decision
in
rands
was
controlling
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
think
so
at
all
your
honor
and
mr.
burch
argues
that
but
i
think
it
points
out
a
very
essential
distinction.
in
rands,
this
court
held
that
as
a
constitutional
matter,
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
provides
that
just
compensation
for
the
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use
does
not
include
the
value
of
any
special
use
in
public
property
and
the
fact
situation
there
was
the
public
property
was
the
use
of
the
water
way
for
the
port
site
--
the
use
of
the
property
of
riparian
property
for
a
port
site
and
the
court
relied
on
the
government’s
navigational
servitude
saying
that
the
government
decides
whether
someone
can
or
cannot
use
navigable
waters
for
a
port
site.
now
congress,
after
that
case
passed
an
act
that
said
that
where
riparian
land
is
taken
in
one
situation
--
that
where
the
entirety
of
the
riparian
property
is
taken
for
harbor
improvements
or
river
improvements
that
any
special
value
that
it
has
as
a
port
site
can
be
included
in
the
valuation
of
the
land.
i
have
two
points
to
make
here.
one
it's
not
at
all
unusual
for
this
court
to
say
what
the
constitutional
requirement
is
for
just
compensation
and
if
the
congress
then
to
provide
more
if
it
thinks
in
a
particular
situation
then
it
should
do
so.
and
secondly,
the
congressional
act
doesn't
go
nearly
as
far
as
the
rands
case
went.
the
rands
case
created
a
broad
principle
that
would
apply
to
any
riparian
taking.
congressional
act
applied
only
if
the
entirety
if
a
man’s
land
is
taken
which
by
the
way
was
not
the
case
here.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it's
a
statutory
act
without
capability
of
overruling
a
constitutional
decision.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
and
congress
could
get
its
way
in
this
case
if
congress
did
something
that
it
has
not
done,
and
that
is
to
declare
that
a
taylor
grazing
act
permit,
on
section
3
of
taylor
grazing
act
creates
a
vested
right
of
property
interest
in
land.
congress
not
only
hasn’t
done
that.
it
has
resisted
suggestions
that
it
should
do
so
and
it
particularly
chose
not
to
do
so
when
it
had
both
possibilities
in
mind
and
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
that
a
little
bit.
in
the
1890s,
ranchers
in
the
west
used
the
public
land
absolutely
as
if
it
were
their
own
and
it
led
to
a
bad
situation
of
range
warfares
into
the
destruction
of
the
range
land
through
overgrazing.
in
1891,
congress
had
first
time
tried
to
do
something
about
that
and
it
passed
the
forest
service
act
and
included
some
range
land
in
the
forest’s
service
act.
but
the
government
under
the
forest
service
act,
that
was
the
secretary
of
agriculture
would
not
permit
grazing
on
the
public
land
except
by
permits
that
he
would
issue
for
a
limited
a
period
of
time
revocable
if
the
land
were
needed
for
other
purposes
or
if
the
land
were
abused.
now,
the
ranchers
in
the
west
strenuously
objected
to
this
as
taking
away
their
vested
right
to
use
the
range
as
they
saw
fit
and
they
brought
the
case
all
the
way
to
this
court,
light
versus
the
united
states,
united
states
versus
light
and
i
think
its
in
220
u.s.,
it’s
cited
in
our
brief.
in
light,
this
court
strongly
upheld
the
right
of
the
government
to
treat
the
public
domain
land
as
a
propriety
and
to
either
grant
or
not
grant
rights
to
private
individuals
to
use
the
public
domain
and
if
it
granted
rights
to
private
individuals
to
determine
how
much
that
right
should
be.
and
in
1934,
when
congress
passed
the
taylor
grazing
act,
it
set
up
two
separate
systems.
set
up
one
system
under
section
13
of
the
act
in
which
a
rancher
could
get
a
leasehold
interest
in
a
part
of
the
public
ranch,
but
it
only
set
that
up
small
or
non-contiguous
tracts
of
land,
and
that
would
be
an
interest
protected
from
expropriation
without
payment
of
its
value.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
i
think
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
and
any
general
environmental
value
ought
to
be
taken
into
considerations,
but
what
shouldn’t
be
taken
into
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right
and
i
don’t
want
to
argue
and
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
right
to
establish
a
broad
principle
that
says
that
any
conceivable
value
that
the
government
is
added
to
property
is
not
a
subject
to
compensation.
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
when
congress
has
acted
and
said
that
a
single
individual
can
use
a
specific
part
of
the
public
land,
but
that
he
shall
have
less
than
a
vested
right
in
that
land
and
this,
i
mean
to
get
to
it
and
i'll
get
to
now,
and
that
vested
right,
that
less
than
invested
right,
that
permit
is
a
considerable
subsidy
to
this
individual.
it's
a
right
for
him
to
use
that
land
at
less
than
its
value.
if
he
wanted
to
rent
the
grazing
land
from
private
owner,
he'd
have
to
pay
great
deal
more
than
he
does
--
than
he
pays
to
government.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
they
are
usually
available
to
contiguous
owners
or
i
think
the
owners
in
the
vicinity
or
owners
with
adequate
water
source
such
as
that.
but
our
main
point
here
is
that
mr.
fuller
has
been
subsidized
in
a
large
way
through
the
use
of
less
than
a
vested
right,
less
than
a
property
right
of
the
public
land
and
he
continues
to
have
that
use
in
fact.
and
when
his
land
is
taken,
he
didn’t
say
the
government
which
has
paid
him
a
benefit
over
the
years
by
letting
him
use
its
land,
didn't
pay
him
again.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
sir.
he
paid
something
for
the
permit,
but
the
value
is
generally
considered
very
much
less
than
the
true
value
of
the
use
of
the
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
--
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
i
think
the
sum
is
$8
or
$9
a
head
and
i
think
that
is
about
a
third
of
the
commercial
rate
or
fourth
commercial
rate
or
something
like
that.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
it
doesn’t.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
what
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
would
like
to
start
by
saying
that
the
right
that
this
individual
has
to
use
the
public
land
is
by
congressional
enactment
less
than
a
property
right,
is
a
permit
to
use
the
federal
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
less
than
a
property
right?
what
i
mean
is
this,
when
the
congress
setup
the
grazing
act,
it
allowed
leases
of
land
to
some
people,
and
that’s
clearly
a
property
right.
but
as
to
the
land,
we
are
talking
about
section
3
land,
it
provided
in
this
statue.
this
permit
shall
create
“no
right
title
or
interest
in
the
public
domain”
and
it’s
clearer
than
setting
up
that
statute
congress
was
faced
with
the
possibility
if
we
take
these
rights
of
way,
should
we
have
to
pay
it
for
and
congress
wanted
to
say
no,
that
it
was
granting
a
benefit
and
it
shouldn't
have
to
pay
again,
it
took
the
benefit
away.
and
congress
knew
that
cattlemen
historically
had
wanted
to
treat
public
land
as
their
own.
so
this
was
in
the
roosevelt
administration
and
they
didn’t
want
it
to
be
treated
that
way.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
i
suppose
the
second
part
of
that
statement
would
be
that
if
mr.
fuller
has
paid
less
than
the
market
price,
he
is
not
getting
just
compensation.
but
when
the
government
takes
that
land,
the
government
is
taking
back
land
that
was
its
land
and
the
government
shouldn’t
have
to
pay
that
value
and
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
case
of
yours
some
time
ago
it
may
not
be
fair
to
cite
cases.
actually,
it's
slightly
different
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
there
was
a
case
when
the
government
took
some
tugboats
and
in
cors
versus
united
states,
government
took
some
tugboats
during
world
war
ii
and
the
statute
under
which
it
took
those
tugboats
said
that
it
shouldn’t
pay
any
value,
over
the
value
that
any
value
created
by
the
present
emergency
of
something
like
that.
tugboats,
actually
at
the
time
of
the
taking
were
selling
for
quite
a
lot
because
the
government
was
buying
them
up
and
this
court
held
that
the
value
which
the
government
itself
created
is
a
value
which
in
fairness
should
--
the
government
--
it's
a
value
which
in
fairness
the
government
should
not
be
required
to
pay.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
just
want
to
make
one
or
two
points
then
to
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
a
rebuttal
if
i
can.
first,
i
want
to
reemphasize
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
subsidy
that
mr.
fuller
has
already
received
in
having
this
grazing
permit
at
less
than
its
true
value
and
then
an
attempt
by
mr.
fuller
to
obtain
what
we
consider
a
second
subsidization
when
his
base
land
is
taken.
i
want
to
emphasize
also
that
the
courts
of
appeals
up
to
this
point
have
held
that
if
the
grazing
land
is
taken
first,
no
compensation
needs
to
be
paid.
and
if
the
base
land
is
then
taken
that
the
value
that
the
grazing
land
might
have
added
is
not
to
be
considered.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
you
have
proffered
it
correctly
on
that
because
there
is
no
right
title
or
interest
in
the
graze
land,
there
is
nothing
to
take
in
the
constitutional.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
so
it
becomes
a
very
anomalies
situation
we
think
that
when
the
grazing
land
has
not
yet
been
taken,
when
it
can
still
be
used
in
connection
with
land
that
mr.
fuller
has,
when
he
still
to
some
extent
is
enjoying
his
subsidy,
to
then
give
him
the
second
subsidization
when
his
own
land
was
taken.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
cox
versus
united
states
is
a
case
that
i
am
talking.
cox
was
--
it
seems
to
me
was
the
major
case
that
the
tenth
circuit
decided
and
cox
had
clearly
said
that
the
value
of
the
grazing
land
could
not
be
considered
even
though
at
that
–-
to
get
to
real
facts
of
cox,
the
grazing
land
had
not
been
taken
there
either
but
the
court
found
that
it
would
be
lost
as
a
result
of
the
taking
of
the
base
land.
and
the
court
held
there,
no
right
to
include
the
special
value
of
the
grazing
land,
in
jaramillo,
its
companion
case
decided
just
immediately
after
it
didn't
(inaudible).
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
know
whether
i
would.
i
think
that
the
case
before
the
court
now
is
a
much
stronger
case
from
united
state's
standpoint
because
here,
there
was
a
use
of
public
land
involved.
now
the
case
you
present
would
be
that
the
public
improves
a
man’s
private
land
and
whether
the
public
should
then
have
to
pay
for
that
improved
value
and
i
don’t
know.
i’d
rather
not
try
to
decide
that
one
now.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i’d
distinguish
it
in
one;
the
value
added
is
by
a
use
of
public
land
that's
still
in
the
public
domain.
and
that
in
the
other,
the
value
added
is
a
benefit
somehow
that
the
government
has
made
to
this
man’s
private
land.
i
want
to
look
into
the
details
of
that
more.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
would
be
so.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
with
the
right
for
the
solicitor
general
to
change
his
mind
if
that
case
came
up.
say,
the
difference
is
this,
that
in
that
case,
the
government
would
move
on
to
private
property,
do
some
work
and
then
leave
and
the
government
interest
would
be
over
at
that
time.
but
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
a
continued
use
of
government
property
and
i
think
that's
a
fundamental
difference.
the
right
of
the
government
to
not
have
to
pay
for
the
value
of
the
public
domain
and
i
think
it's
a
kind
of
holding
that
this
court
has
already
made
in
united
states
versus
rands
and
in
a
whole
series
of
cases
dating
back
into
the
19th
century
on
which
rands
was
supported.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
we're
not
seeking
a
broad
ruling
in
this
case.
we
are
seeking
a
ruling
based
upon
what
congress
has
done
under
the
taylor
grazing
act,
that
kind
of
interest
that
congress
gave
under
the
taylor
grazing.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
the
state
owned
the
land,
we
would
argue
that
mr.
fuller
has
less
than
a
compensable
interest
in
the
state
land
which
he
held
under
tenure
that
was
less
than
a
lease,
and
then
we
would
not
have
to
pay
for
it.
but
i
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
because
under
what
i
hope
are
established
principles
of
just
compensation,
the
government
only
pays
for
established
property
rights
that
a
person
holds,
not
for
rights
that
are
less
than
a
type.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
no.
he
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
--
i
wasn’t
thinking
of
the
gift
case,
the
gift
case.
i
was
talking
about
the
use
of
lands,
of
state
lands
under
less
than
a
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
i
agree
with
you.
i
don’t
have
to
go
that
far
and
what
i
was
about
to
say
is
that
i
think
our
case
is
much
stronger
than
the
case
would
be
as
a
state
land
which
is
here,
the
government
itself
has
conferred
a
special
privilege
in
a
revocable
fashion.
and
when
the
government
takes
this
land,
it
seems
particularly
unfair
and
not
as
a
question
of
just
compensation
to
make
the
government
pay
again
for
the
favor
that
it
did
before.
and
cattlemen
in
the
west
have
received,
it
seems
to
me
quite
adequate
subsidies
from
the
government
without
the
court
creating
or
making
a
single
subsidy
larger.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
just
have
few
things
i
want
to
straighten
up.
first
on
the
instruction
to
the
jury.
the
judge
said,
you
may
take
these
permits
into
consideration
in
arriving
at
your
value
of
the
subject
land,
keeping
in
mind
the
possibility
that
they
maybe
withdrawn
without
compensation.
so
that
jury
was
instructed,
they
could
take
them
into
consideration.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
about
to
get
to
that.
in
the
appendix
that
we
submitted
with
which
is
just
a
very
small
part
of
the
record,
there
are
four
volumes
of
the
record,
we
picked
out
a
few
places
where
references
were
made
to
the
permit
land,
but
it’s
all
through
out
this
record
that
--
maybe
mr.
burch
did
pick
the
wrong
strategy
for
the
case,
but
the
strategy
he
picked
was
to
evaluate
this
fee
land
and
permit
land
together
and
try
to
get
the
value
of
that
permit
land.
we
wouldn't
have
had
any
objection
if
he
said
this
is
a
beautiful
piece
of
fee
land
with
water
and
thus
and
thus
and
thus
and
so,
and
it
left
out
the
business
about
the
use
of
30,000
acres
of
federal
land.
now
here,
at
page
25
of
the
appendix
is
mr.
fuller
himself
testifying,
and
he
is
describing
his
lands,
he
says,
well,
it
has
of
course
fine
water
and
very
fine
climate
for
growing
the
kind
of
crops
that
we
have
to
have.
then
we
have
soil
which
is
not
quite
so
important,
but
still
it
is
necessary.
so
as
then,
we
have
the
availability
of
federal
land
as
well
a
state
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
know.
if
we
have
got
an
instruction
from
the
jury
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
there
is
such
testimony
in
the
record
of
this
case
where
the
lands
were
treated
together
and
the
government
on
cross
examination
tried
to
point
out
well,
you
are
figuring
the
two
and
together
and
mr.
fuller's
appraisers
will
say,
well,
it's
one
unitary
operation,
you
can't
value
one
without
the
other.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
believe
they
came
out
in
the
area
of
$800,000.00
for
an
award
on
what
they
called
the
value
of
the
fee
land,
but
in
figuring
the
value
of
the
fee
land,
they
figured
how
many
cows
could
be
raised
on
the
fee
land
together
with
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
920.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
they
got
a
good
deal
less
than
they
might
have
gotten
and
a
good
deal
more
than
the
government
thought
they
should
have
had
on
the
basis
of
the
fee
land
itself.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
often
so.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that
is
correct.
the
proposition
of
law
involved
here
as
to
whether
the
government
has
a
legal
duty
to
pay
for
the
value
added
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
during
the
case?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
right
in
the
middle
of
the
trial?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
guess
[attempt
to
laughter]
depending
on
what
the
prior
testimony
had
been,
you
might
have
a
mistrial.
but
actually
i
think
it
would
--
the
problem
with
the
trial
was
a
pretrial
order
that
stated
that
the
value
of
the
permits
could
be
considered,
a
testimony
that
said
it
could
be
even
the
instruction.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issue
presented
by
the
case
is
the
following:
when
the
government
condemns
land
for
public
project,
must
it
pay
for
the
value
added
to
the
land
by
a
permit
to
graze
cattle
on
adjacent
public
land,
and
i
can
refine
that
one
step
further;
when
that
permit
is
admittedly
a
revocable
permit
that
the
government
can
revoke
without
payment
of
compensation.
the
factual
situation
in
which
the
case
arose
is
the
following:
government
determined
that
it
was
necessary
to
build
a
dam
as
a
flood-control
project
on
the
bill
williams
river
in
arizona,
an
area
that
is
subject
to
flash
floods.
mr.
fuller
owned
three
tracts
of
land
in
the
vicinity
of
this
project.
it
was
the
total
--
about
1,280
acres.
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
take
two
of
those
tracts
that
totaled
920
acres.
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
take
the
third
and
third
tract
was
not
taken.
in
connection
with
his
land,
mr.
fuller
for
a
number
of
years
had
been
using
30,000
acres
of
federal
grazing
land
to
graze
his
cattle
in
it.
he
used
that
land
under
permit
issued
under
section
5
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
of
1934.
section
5
permit,
now,
i
will
talk
about
in
a
little
more
detail
later,
is
a
revocable
permit
that
by
statute
does
not
create
any
right,
title
or
interest
in
the
public
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
term
is
not
stated
in
the
statue
except
that
it
cannot
exceed
10
years
as
an
administrative
regulation
and
practice.
the
permits
are
issued
year
by
year.
the
permit
has
to
be
reissued
each
year.
they
are
customarily
reissued
to
the
same
person
and
had
them
the
year
before,
but
the
permit
is
for
one
year.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
--
i
think
there
is
a
formal
procedure
for
termination
and
to
this
extent
that
if
a
man
applies
for
the
permit
for
a
second
year
and
the
government
determines
not
to
grant
the
permit
the
second
year,
the
government
will
allow
him
to
--
it
will
state
its
reasons
why
the
permits
not
being
granted
and
will
allow
him
to
state
his
reasons
why
he
thinks
the
permit
should
be
granted.
it's
not
--
the
government
won’t
deny
a
permit
just
out
of
hand,
but
the
permits
are
revocable
and
often
when
the
property
is
needed
for
another
purpose
or
the
property
hasn’t
been
properly
used
are
revoked.
now,
there’s
a
peculiarity
of
this
case
that
needs
to
be
kept
in
mind.
the
government
did
not
revoke
mr.
fuller’s
grazing
permit
when
it
took
these
two
tracts
of
land.
the
reason
it
didn’t
do
so
is
that
it
didn’t
take
his
third
tract
of
land
and
he
was
free
to
continue
to
use
this
permit
in
connection
with
the
third
tract
of
land.
in
arizona,
the
basis
for
having
a
grazing
permit
is
having
sufficient
water
for
the
cattle
that
roam
on
the
federal
land
to
use
on
the
private
land
and
he
had
sufficient
water
apparently
on
his
third
tract
of
land
and
so
far
as
we
know,
mr.
fuller
is
still
using
this
permit.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it’s
interior.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
it
has
not
done
so
as
far
as
i
understand.
actually,
part
of
what
brings
this
case
here
is
that
the
department
of
the
interior
has
been
very
generous
with
the
use
of
this
land
because
if
the
department
of
interior
had
revoked
his
use
of
the
30,000
acres
of
public
land
before
it
took
the
land
in
question,
at
least
according
to
the
jurisprudence
in
the
courts
of
appeal,
up
to
this
point,
there
wouldn't
have
been
no
question
at
all
that
he
would
have
had
no
right
to
ask
the
jury
to
evaluate
his
use
of
the
public
land
along
with
his
use
of
his
private
land
and
it’s
our
contention
that
it’s
just
nonsense
to
say
that
this
revocable
permit
creating
less
than
a
property
right
and
the
public
land
that
could
have
been
revoked;
gives
him
a
right
to
additional
compensation
because
the
government
chose
not
to
revoke
it.
if
the
government
now
took
his
next
piece
of
land,
the
third
of
piece
of
land,
under
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
government
would
have
to
pay
again
for
the
same
permit.
now,
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
mr.
fuller
relied
heavily
on
the
number
of
cows
that
could
be
grazed
on
his
land
plus
the
public
land
and
obtained
an
instruction
from
the
trial
judge
that
the
jury
could
take
into
account
his
use
of
the
public
land
and
giving
him
compensation
for
his
private
land
so
long
as
it
also
took
into
account
the
fact
that
the
public
land
was
held
under
revocable
permits
that
those
permits
could
be
revoked
without
payment
of
compensation.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
$350,000
for
the
920
acres
of
ranch
land
that
was
taken
and
the
government
appealed.
the
ninth
circuit
divided
on
the
case.
the
majority
held
that
because
the
permit
had
not
been
revoked
distinguishing
this
from
the
situation
with
permit
had
already
been
revoked,
he
had
a
right
to
get
the
value
of
the
public
land
along
with
the
value
of
his
private
land
and
i
should
say
that
more
accurately.
he
had
a
right
in
determining
the
value
of
his
private
land
to
have
added
to
that
any
special
value
provided
by
the
use
of
the
public
land.
the
court
was
at
pains
to
distinguish
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
versus
rands
which
in
a
rather
similar
situation
had
held
exactly
to
the
contrary.
the
man
had
private
land
along
a
river
and
had
a
special
value
added
to
that
land
by
its
possible
uses
of
port
site
that
the
government
in
taking
the
land
would
not
have
to
pay
the
special
port
site
value
that
was
added.
the
dissenting
judge
found
that
the
decision
in
rands
was
controlling
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
think
so
at
all
your
honor
and
mr.
burch
argues
that
but
i
think
it
points
out
a
very
essential
distinction.
in
rands,
this
court
held
that
as
a
constitutional
matter,
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
provides
that
just
compensation
for
the
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use
does
not
include
the
value
of
any
special
use
in
public
property
and
the
fact
situation
there
was
the
public
property
was
the
use
of
the
water
way
for
the
port
site
--
the
use
of
the
property
of
riparian
property
for
a
port
site
and
the
court
relied
on
the
government’s
navigational
servitude
saying
that
the
government
decides
whether
someone
can
or
cannot
use
navigable
waters
for
a
port
site.
now
congress,
after
that
case
passed
an
act
that
said
that
where
riparian
land
is
taken
in
one
situation
--
that
where
the
entirety
of
the
riparian
property
is
taken
for
harbor
improvements
or
river
improvements
that
any
special
value
that
it
has
as
a
port
site
can
be
included
in
the
valuation
of
the
land.
i
have
two
points
to
make
here.
one
it's
not
at
all
unusual
for
this
court
to
say
what
the
constitutional
requirement
is
for
just
compensation
and
if
the
congress
then
to
provide
more
if
it
thinks
in
a
particular
situation
then
it
should
do
so.
and
secondly,
the
congressional
act
doesn't
go
nearly
as
far
as
the
rands
case
went.
the
rands
case
created
a
broad
principle
that
would
apply
to
any
riparian
taking.
congressional
act
applied
only
if
the
entirety
if
a
man’s
land
is
taken
which
by
the
way
was
not
the
case
here.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it's
a
statutory
act
without
capability
of
overruling
a
constitutional
decision.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
and
congress
could
get
its
way
in
this
case
if
congress
did
something
that
it
has
not
done,
and
that
is
to
declare
that
a
taylor
grazing
act
permit,
on
section
3
of
taylor
grazing
act
creates
a
vested
right
of
property
interest
in
land.
congress
not
only
hasn’t
done
that.
it
has
resisted
suggestions
that
it
should
do
so
and
it
particularly
chose
not
to
do
so
when
it
had
both
possibilities
in
mind
and
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
that
a
little
bit.
in
the
1890s,
ranchers
in
the
west
used
the
public
land
absolutely
as
if
it
were
their
own
and
it
led
to
a
bad
situation
of
range
warfares
into
the
destruction
of
the
range
land
through
overgrazing.
in
1891,
congress
had
first
time
tried
to
do
something
about
that
and
it
passed
the
forest
service
act
and
included
some
range
land
in
the
forest’s
service
act.
but
the
government
under
the
forest
service
act,
that
was
the
secretary
of
agriculture
would
not
permit
grazing
on
the
public
land
except
by
permits
that
he
would
issue
for
a
limited
a
period
of
time
revocable
if
the
land
were
needed
for
other
purposes
or
if
the
land
were
abused.
now,
the
ranchers
in
the
west
strenuously
objected
to
this
as
taking
away
their
vested
right
to
use
the
range
as
they
saw
fit
and
they
brought
the
case
all
the
way
to
this
court,
light
versus
the
united
states,
united
states
versus
light
and
i
think
its
in
220
u.s.,
it’s
cited
in
our
brief.
in
light,
this
court
strongly
upheld
the
right
of
the
government
to
treat
the
public
domain
land
as
a
propriety
and
to
either
grant
or
not
grant
rights
to
private
individuals
to
use
the
public
domain
and
if
it
granted
rights
to
private
individuals
to
determine
how
much
that
right
should
be.
and
in
1934,
when
congress
passed
the
taylor
grazing
act,
it
set
up
two
separate
systems.
set
up
one
system
under
section
13
of
the
act
in
which
a
rancher
could
get
a
leasehold
interest
in
a
part
of
the
public
ranch,
but
it
only
set
that
up
small
or
non-contiguous
tracts
of
land,
and
that
would
be
an
interest
protected
from
expropriation
without
payment
of
its
value.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
i
think
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
and
any
general
environmental
value
ought
to
be
taken
into
considerations,
but
what
shouldn’t
be
taken
into
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right
and
i
don’t
want
to
argue
and
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
right
to
establish
a
broad
principle
that
says
that
any
conceivable
value
that
the
government
is
added
to
property
is
not
a
subject
to
compensation.
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
when
congress
has
acted
and
said
that
a
single
individual
can
use
a
specific
part
of
the
public
land,
but
that
he
shall
have
less
than
a
vested
right
in
that
land
and
this,
i
mean
to
get
to
it
and
i'll
get
to
now,
and
that
vested
right,
that
less
than
invested
right,
that
permit
is
a
considerable
subsidy
to
this
individual.
it's
a
right
for
him
to
use
that
land
at
less
than
its
value.
if
he
wanted
to
rent
the
grazing
land
from
private
owner,
he'd
have
to
pay
great
deal
more
than
he
does
--
than
he
pays
to
government.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
they
are
usually
available
to
contiguous
owners
or
i
think
the
owners
in
the
vicinity
or
owners
with
adequate
water
source
such
as
that.
but
our
main
point
here
is
that
mr.
fuller
has
been
subsidized
in
a
large
way
through
the
use
of
less
than
a
vested
right,
less
than
a
property
right
of
the
public
land
and
he
continues
to
have
that
use
in
fact.
and
when
his
land
is
taken,
he
didn’t
say
the
government
which
has
paid
him
a
benefit
over
the
years
by
letting
him
use
its
land,
didn't
pay
him
again.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
sir.
he
paid
something
for
the
permit,
but
the
value
is
generally
considered
very
much
less
than
the
true
value
of
the
use
of
the
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
--
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
i
think
the
sum
is
$8
or
$9
a
head
and
i
think
that
is
about
a
third
of
the
commercial
rate
or
fourth
commercial
rate
or
something
like
that.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
it
doesn’t.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
what
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
would
like
to
start
by
saying
that
the
right
that
this
individual
has
to
use
the
public
land
is
by
congressional
enactment
less
than
a
property
right,
is
a
permit
to
use
the
federal
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
less
than
a
property
right?
what
i
mean
is
this,
when
the
congress
setup
the
grazing
act,
it
allowed
leases
of
land
to
some
people,
and
that’s
clearly
a
property
right.
but
as
to
the
land,
we
are
talking
about
section
3
land,
it
provided
in
this
statue.
this
permit
shall
create
“no
right
title
or
interest
in
the
public
domain”
and
it’s
clearer
than
setting
up
that
statute
congress
was
faced
with
the
possibility
if
we
take
these
rights
of
way,
should
we
have
to
pay
it
for
and
congress
wanted
to
say
no,
that
it
was
granting
a
benefit
and
it
shouldn't
have
to
pay
again,
it
took
the
benefit
away.
and
congress
knew
that
cattlemen
historically
had
wanted
to
treat
public
land
as
their
own.
so
this
was
in
the
roosevelt
administration
and
they
didn’t
want
it
to
be
treated
that
way.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
i
suppose
the
second
part
of
that
statement
would
be
that
if
mr.
fuller
has
paid
less
than
the
market
price,
he
is
not
getting
just
compensation.
but
when
the
government
takes
that
land,
the
government
is
taking
back
land
that
was
its
land
and
the
government
shouldn’t
have
to
pay
that
value
and
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
case
of
yours
some
time
ago
it
may
not
be
fair
to
cite
cases.
actually,
it's
slightly
different
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
there
was
a
case
when
the
government
took
some
tugboats
and
in
cors
versus
united
states,
government
took
some
tugboats
during
world
war
ii
and
the
statute
under
which
it
took
those
tugboats
said
that
it
shouldn’t
pay
any
value,
over
the
value
that
any
value
created
by
the
present
emergency
of
something
like
that.
tugboats,
actually
at
the
time
of
the
taking
were
selling
for
quite
a
lot
because
the
government
was
buying
them
up
and
this
court
held
that
the
value
which
the
government
itself
created
is
a
value
which
in
fairness
should
--
the
government
--
it's
a
value
which
in
fairness
the
government
should
not
be
required
to
pay.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
just
want
to
make
one
or
two
points
then
to
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
a
rebuttal
if
i
can.
first,
i
want
to
reemphasize
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
subsidy
that
mr.
fuller
has
already
received
in
having
this
grazing
permit
at
less
than
its
true
value
and
then
an
attempt
by
mr.
fuller
to
obtain
what
we
consider
a
second
subsidization
when
his
base
land
is
taken.
i
want
to
emphasize
also
that
the
courts
of
appeals
up
to
this
point
have
held
that
if
the
grazing
land
is
taken
first,
no
compensation
needs
to
be
paid.
and
if
the
base
land
is
then
taken
that
the
value
that
the
grazing
land
might
have
added
is
not
to
be
considered.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
you
have
proffered
it
correctly
on
that
because
there
is
no
right
title
or
interest
in
the
graze
land,
there
is
nothing
to
take
in
the
constitutional.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
so
it
becomes
a
very
anomalies
situation
we
think
that
when
the
grazing
land
has
not
yet
been
taken,
when
it
can
still
be
used
in
connection
with
land
that
mr.
fuller
has,
when
he
still
to
some
extent
is
enjoying
his
subsidy,
to
then
give
him
the
second
subsidization
when
his
own
land
was
taken.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
cox
versus
united
states
is
a
case
that
i
am
talking.
cox
was
--
it
seems
to
me
was
the
major
case
that
the
tenth
circuit
decided
and
cox
had
clearly
said
that
the
value
of
the
grazing
land
could
not
be
considered
even
though
at
that
–-
to
get
to
real
facts
of
cox,
the
grazing
land
had
not
been
taken
there
either
but
the
court
found
that
it
would
be
lost
as
a
result
of
the
taking
of
the
base
land.
and
the
court
held
there,
no
right
to
include
the
special
value
of
the
grazing
land,
in
jaramillo,
its
companion
case
decided
just
immediately
after
it
didn't
(inaudible).
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don’t
know
whether
i
would.
i
think
that
the
case
before
the
court
now
is
a
much
stronger
case
from
united
state's
standpoint
because
here,
there
was
a
use
of
public
land
involved.
now
the
case
you
present
would
be
that
the
public
improves
a
man’s
private
land
and
whether
the
public
should
then
have
to
pay
for
that
improved
value
and
i
don’t
know.
i’d
rather
not
try
to
decide
that
one
now.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i’d
distinguish
it
in
one;
the
value
added
is
by
a
use
of
public
land
that's
still
in
the
public
domain.
and
that
in
the
other,
the
value
added
is
a
benefit
somehow
that
the
government
has
made
to
this
man’s
private
land.
i
want
to
look
into
the
details
of
that
more.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
would
be
so.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
with
the
right
for
the
solicitor
general
to
change
his
mind
if
that
case
came
up.
say,
the
difference
is
this,
that
in
that
case,
the
government
would
move
on
to
private
property,
do
some
work
and
then
leave
and
the
government
interest
would
be
over
at
that
time.
but
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
a
continued
use
of
government
property
and
i
think
that's
a
fundamental
difference.
the
right
of
the
government
to
not
have
to
pay
for
the
value
of
the
public
domain
and
i
think
it's
a
kind
of
holding
that
this
court
has
already
made
in
united
states
versus
rands
and
in
a
whole
series
of
cases
dating
back
into
the
19th
century
on
which
rands
was
supported.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
we're
not
seeking
a
broad
ruling
in
this
case.
we
are
seeking
a
ruling
based
upon
what
congress
has
done
under
the
taylor
grazing
act,
that
kind
of
interest
that
congress
gave
under
the
taylor
grazing.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
the
state
owned
the
land,
we
would
argue
that
mr.
fuller
has
less
than
a
compensable
interest
in
the
state
land
which
he
held
under
tenure
that
was
less
than
a
lease,
and
then
we
would
not
have
to
pay
for
it.
but
i
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
because
under
what
i
hope
are
established
principles
of
just
compensation,
the
government
only
pays
for
established
property
rights
that
a
person
holds,
not
for
rights
that
are
less
than
a
type.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
no.
he
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
--
i
wasn’t
thinking
of
the
gift
case,
the
gift
case.
i
was
talking
about
the
use
of
lands,
of
state
lands
under
less
than
a
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
i
agree
with
you.
i
don’t
have
to
go
that
far
and
what
i
was
about
to
say
is
that
i
think
our
case
is
much
stronger
than
the
case
would
be
as
a
state
land
which
is
here,
the
government
itself
has
conferred
a
special
privilege
in
a
revocable
fashion.
and
when
the
government
takes
this
land,
it
seems
particularly
unfair
and
not
as
a
question
of
just
compensation
to
make
the
government
pay
again
for
the
favor
that
it
did
before.
and
cattlemen
in
the
west
have
received,
it
seems
to
me
quite
adequate
subsidies
from
the
government
without
the
court
creating
or
making
a
single
subsidy
larger.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
just
have
few
things
i
want
to
straighten
up.
first
on
the
instruction
to
the
jury.
the
judge
said,
you
may
take
these
permits
into
consideration
in
arriving
at
your
value
of
the
subject
land,
keeping
in
mind
the
possibility
that
they
maybe
withdrawn
without
compensation.
so
that
jury
was
instructed,
they
could
take
them
into
consideration.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
about
to
get
to
that.
in
the
appendix
that
we
submitted
with
which
is
just
a
very
small
part
of
the
record,
there
are
four
volumes
of
the
record,
we
picked
out
a
few
places
where
references
were
made
to
the
permit
land,
but
it’s
all
through
out
this
record
that
--
maybe
mr.
burch
did
pick
the
wrong
strategy
for
the
case,
but
the
strategy
he
picked
was
to
evaluate
this
fee
land
and
permit
land
together
and
try
to
get
the
value
of
that
permit
land.
we
wouldn't
have
had
any
objection
if
he
said
this
is
a
beautiful
piece
of
fee
land
with
water
and
thus
and
thus
and
thus
and
so,
and
it
left
out
the
business
about
the
use
of
30,000
acres
of
federal
land.
now
here,
at
page
25
of
the
appendix
is
mr.
fuller
himself
testifying,
and
he
is
describing
his
lands,
he
says,
well,
it
has
of
course
fine
water
and
very
fine
climate
for
growing
the
kind
of
crops
that
we
have
to
have.
then
we
have
soil
which
is
not
quite
so
important,
but
still
it
is
necessary.
so
as
then,
we
have
the
availability
of
federal
land
as
well
a
state
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
know.
if
we
have
got
an
instruction
from
the
jury
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
there
is
such
testimony
in
the
record
of
this
case
where
the
lands
were
treated
together
and
the
government
on
cross
examination
tried
to
point
out
well,
you
are
figuring
the
two
and
together
and
mr.
fuller's
appraisers
will
say,
well,
it's
one
unitary
operation,
you
can't
value
one
without
the
other.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
believe
they
came
out
in
the
area
of
$800,000.00
for
an
award
on
what
they
called
the
value
of
the
fee
land,
but
in
figuring
the
value
of
the
fee
land,
they
figured
how
many
cows
could
be
raised
on
the
fee
land
together
with
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
920.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
they
got
a
good
deal
less
than
they
might
have
gotten
and
a
good
deal
more
than
the
government
thought
they
should
have
had
on
the
basis
of
the
fee
land
itself.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
often
so.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that
is
correct.
the
proposition
of
law
involved
here
as
to
whether
the
government
has
a
legal
duty
to
pay
for
the
value
added
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
during
the
case?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
right
in
the
middle
of
the
trial?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
guess
[attempt
to
laughter]
depending
on
what
the
prior
testimony
had
been,
you
might
have
a
mistrial.
but
actually
i
think
it
would
--
the
problem
with
the
trial
was
a
pretrial
order
that
stated
that
the
value
of
the
permits
could
be
considered,
a
testimony
that
said
it
could
be
even
the
instruction.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
