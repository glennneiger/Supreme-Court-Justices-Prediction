mr.
frank
haze
burch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
has
indicated
to
the
court,
i
think
erroneously
that
--
and
perhaps
inadvertently
in
response
to
a
question
that
fuller
remained
in
business,
that
he
was
still
operating
around,
these
are
the
statements
there
as
the
record,
they
are
not
accurate
and
it
simply
points
up
the
danger
of
applying
the
rands
analogy
to
these
kind
of
cases.
i
hope
i
can
persuade
the
court
in
my
statement
to
you.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
only
that
i
think
that
the
possibilities
of
less
than
adequate
compensation
are
present
and
the
indication
would
be
with
counsel
saying
do
that
the
rands
is
still
in
existence
and
operating
is
not
effect.
matter
of
fact,
matter
was
that
the
compensation
that
was
received
wasn’t
enough
to
cover
the
existing
debts.
so
if
it’s
a
thing
the
court,
i
don’t
think
should
consider
in
any
event
that
it
was
there
and
the
statement
was
inaccurate
when
it
was
made
to
the
court.
the
u.s
versus
jaramillo
case
which
has
been
remarked
onto
the
court
in
oral
presentation
and
which
is
briefed
is
directly
in
point
with
fuller
as
we
understand
it,
and
i
think
it
stands
for
the
proposition,
not
as
counsel
has
stated
that
one
must
be
paid
or
subsidized,
but
that
it
simply
means
you
can
take
into
consideration
in
determining
the
market
value
of
a
ranch,
the
availability
and
the
accessibility
of
permit
land,
and
that's
really
all
that
the
court
instructed.
judge
craig
in
the
district
court
was
extremely
careful
not
to
distinguish
rands
which
he
didn't
know
about
at
the
time,
but
to
follow
jaramillo
which
we
consider
to
be
the
law
and
certainly
a
well
reasoned
conclusion.
he
did
tell
the
jury
as
we
have
pointed
out
to
you
that
they
must
recognize
the
possibility
of
government
revocation
of
the
permits
and
the
leases
and
incidentally
the
question
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
remarked
on,
there
was
state
land
involved
in
this.
there
was
30,000
acres
of
federal
lease
land,
12,000
acres
of
state
land
which
the
applicant
owned
and
approximately
1,200
acres
of
fee
land.
also,
there
was
some
indication
that
the
reason
bom
did
not
revoke
these
leases
was
the
remainder
of
the
fee
land.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
at
all.
it
was
isolated
across
the
river
and
it
couldn’t
be
made
accessible
under
any
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
the
judge
specifically
told
them
that
they
couldn't
consider
the
value
of
those
permits
either,
although
there
were
ten-year
leases
as
i
recall.
but
i
believe,
i
have
the
full
instructions
set
out
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
court
did
in
fact
specifically
state
that
the
jury
was
not
to
consider
any
value
given
to
state
or
federal
permits
as
the
case
maybe,
whether
they
were
taylor
grazing
act,
section
5
leases
or
state
of
arizona
land
leases
for
agricultural
purposes
or
grazing
purposes.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
somewhat
different,
mr.
chief
justice,
somewhat
different
simply
because
there
is
a
preference
in
arizona
that
i
am
unaware
of
whether
not
it
holds
over
in
taylor,
but
arizona,
if
the
state
needed
that
land
for
any
purpose
for
a
length
of
time
and
then
put
it
back
on
the
market,
the
preference
would
go
to
that
(inaudible)
who
had
been
the
prior
lessee
or
permittee.
but
nonetheless,
i
think
the
court
properly
instructed
and
the
jury
was
properly
aware
that
these
values,
if
there
was
any
value
in
the
permits,
must
not
be
considered
and
the
testimony
in
the
case
was
quite
clear
that
those
who
testified
as
the
value
distinguished
the
permit
land
and
reduced
the
total
value
of
the
fee
land
by
whatever
they
felt
was
the
value
of
the
permit
land.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
i
have
a
note
here
that
the
court
in
its
instruction
said,
give
to
the
fee
lands
such
value
as
the
availability
and
accessibility
of
the
permit
and
fee
land
might
create
in
conjunction
with
the
fee.
now
the
government
has
said
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
coincidently,
the
state
was
in
there
to
get
the
value
of
its
land
in
the
proceeding
also
and
that
was
a
separate
matter
which
was
settled
out
of
court
ultimately.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
permits
for
grazing
are
not
compensable
property
right,
but
we
do
not
agree
that
a
jury
must
to
take
a
legal
fiction
and
say
they
are
not
accessible,
they
are
not
available,
they
do
not
exist
when
in
fact
you
have
an
actual
operating
cow/calf
operation,
and
the
government
is
going
to
take
that
operation
and
leave
you
with
the
permits.
now
it
doesn't
then
make
a
fair
compensation.
it
certainly
doesn't
take
into
effect
the
work,
the
effort,
the
improvements
of
that
existing
cow/calf
operation
had
and
i
say
that
the
cow/calf
operation,
because
it's
distinguishing
factor.
this
was
not
some
lease
of
a
large
amount
of
federal
acreage
where
someone
run
a
steer
operation
on
the
permit
land,
bought
cows
or
calves
in
the
winter,
fed
them
during
the
spring
and
sold
them
in
early
summer.
as
the
record
revealed
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
understood,
the
fee
land
was
the
important
reason
for
the
existence
of
this
ranch.
you
will
have
two
wells
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
our
appraisers
and
their
testimony
simply
said,
the
permit
land
we
put
to
one
side.
the
fee
land
can
support
somewhere
between
800
and
1,000
cow
units
per
year
by
reason
of
its
accessibility
of
water,
its
fertileness,
its
bermuda
grass,
pastures,
its
alfalfa
crops.
we
can
support
x
number
of
cows,
if
you
allowed
us
to
consider
the
permit
land,
it
would
be
worth
this
much
more,
and
that's
how
the
testimony
went
and
that's
how
the
verdict
was
arrived
at.
they
did
not
consider
it.
the
permit
land
as
having
any
value
except
that
it
was
available
in
case
of
a
good
year,
you
could
put
those
cows
on
and
maybe
grow
more
fee.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
precisely.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
say
you
this,
and
perhaps
i
don’t
follow
mr,
justice
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
think
it
must
have
been.
simple
reason
that
all
of
our
experts
testified
that
the
property
had
a
considerably
larger
value
than
that.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh!
yes.
they
were
told
to
consider
the
availability
of
the
land,
its
accessibility,
but
to
give
it
no
value
in
coming
to
their
conclusion.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh,
yes.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
it's
a
side
and
i
believe
in
the
government's
brief
--
one
man
a
mr.
perry
who
was
an
appraiser
testified
would
be
i
think
it
worth
about
$1,150,000.00
with
the
permits
and
approximately
a
million
without
them.
he
gave
the
permits
--
the
permit
in
that
land
a
very
little
value,
about
a
$150,000.00
as
i
recall.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
in
the
sense
that
they
are
no
award
could
be
made
for
the
permit
land.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
would
agree
that
the
proceeding
was
to
determine
the
value
of
the
fee
land
and
that
determination
was
to
be
made
considering
the
use
it
was
put
to
and
the
accessibility
of
adjacent
lands
which
we
have
a
permit
for.
but
if
there
was
to
be
any
value
given
to
those
permit
lands,
it
could
not
be
translated
into
a
jury
award
and
the
court
is
right
there
to
tell
them
that
it
must
not
be.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
in
fact,
the
matter
of
value
was
quite
bitterly
fought.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
yes.
no,
in
our
case
there
was
a
great
hideous
between
the
appraisers
for
the
owner,
fuller
and
the
government.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
well,
we
wanted
to
make
sure
that
our
appraisers,
justice
rehnquist,
could
testify
as
to
what
in
fact
a
cow/calf
operation
was,
and
we
wanted
to
get
before
the
court
and
the
jury
as
much
information
as
possible
about
the
very
nature
of
the
operation.
it
was
completely
distinguishable
from,
as
i
have
indicated
to
you,
a
steer
operation.
we
felt
that
any
appraiser
that
got
in
and
i
simply
said,
i
looked
at
1,000
acres
of
land
without
understanding
what
it
was,
couldn't
come
up
with
an
intelligent
evaluation,
and
we
felt
that
that
kind
of
testimony
in
the
light
of
jaramillo
was
absolutely
a
necessity.
otherwise,
they
would
simply
have
been
saying,
we
have
a
1,200
acres
or
whatever
the
case
maybe
which
we
will
pretend
is
not
the
cow/calf
operation
which
is
its
highest
and
best
use.
i
might
at
this
point
digress
for
a
moment
and
remark
on
rands
and
its
ultimate
effect,
i
think
upon
ranchers
and
people
with
riparian
fast
land
holdings.
as
i
read
it,
the
government's
case
and
as
i
understand
their
position
in
this
matter,
their
position
basically
is
that
if
you
are
adjacent
in
the
case
of
rands
to
a
navigable
stream
or
body
of
water
and
you
own
fee
land
and
it
is
condemned
by
the
government,
then
you
cannot
consider
any
use
that
that
land
might
have
relating
to
accessibility
to
the
water,
to
the
navigable
stream
or
body
of
water.
and
counsel
says,
they
want
a
very
limited
interpretation
of
this
case
and
that
its
application
perhaps
by
assumption
and
would
be
limited.
but
in
all
the
western
states,
in
fact
all
of
the
states
in
the
country
bordering
on
big
rivers,
arizona,
particularly
where
i
come
has
the
colorado,
a
whole
city
has
been
built
on
the
colorado
on
fee
land,
secured
from
the
state
of
arizona,
and
they
call
it
havasu
city.
they
built
the
london
bridge
there.
that
use
is
specifically
because
the
colorado
river
is
there.
if
i
follow
the
government's
reasoning
and
the
application
of
rands,
what
they
are
saying
if
it
is
necessary
for
the
federal
government
to
go
to
havasu
city,
take
the
bridge,
the
houses,
the
resorts,
the
restaurants,
the
recreation
area
on
fee
land
immediately
adjacent
to
that
river,
but
solely
related
to
the
presence
of
that
river,
they
don't
have
to
pay
the
fair
market
value
of
that
land.
they
have
the
legal
fiction
that
because
it
is
adjacent
to
a
navigable
stream,
it
has
value
only
without
the
application
of
that
stream.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes
sir.
that's
how
rands
can
be
extended
as
i
read
it.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
no.
only
at
that
--
in
limited
areas.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
as
a
potential.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
that
is
correct.
if
we
have
that
was
the
potential
use.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
then,
they
pay
full
market
value
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
follow
you.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
in
that
instance,
rands
wouldn't
apply
in
any
event,
because
it
is
not
navigable
stream
as
you
understand.
that
wouldn't
be
the
case.
where
if
they
simply
took
the
dam
down
and
went
away,
property
owners
at
the
dams,
they
are
in
the
same
position
he
was
before.
he
was
received
nothing,
he
has
lost
nothing
because
that
has
occurred.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
our
situation
here
is
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
of
course,
as
they
came
and
took
the
land.
it
wasn't
the
matter
of
taking
away
the
facility.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
only
slightly
different.
we
would
then
be
talking
about
a
cow/calf
operation
with
12,000
state
acres.
as
the
case
was,
we
were
talking
about
a
cow/calf
operation
with
12,000
state
acres
and
32,000
federal
acres
immediately
adjacent
to
it.
so
it
would
only
been
a
small
matter
of
degree.
as
our
witnesses
testified
some
years
on
that
land
that
the
government
saves
as
valuable
subsidy.
you
are
lucky
if
you
can
run
a
cow
on
a
section
that
640
acres.
sometimes
maybe
you
get
a
cow
to
a
thousand
acres.
the
answer
if
the
government
feels
it's
being
undone
by
the
subsidy
to
simply
raise
the
rental
which
they
have
every
right
to
do.
we
have
made
comment
in
our
brief
to
the
court
that
there
is
another
point
to
be
considered
in
this
matter
and
that
is
simply
the
proposition
that
while
rands
may
control
the
compensation
under
a
taking
or
did
control
until
the
amendment
that
which
reduced
its
effectiveness
and
i
think
indicates
a
congressional
change
in
the
onerous
rule
of
rands
that
while
rands
may
control
as
to
riparian
fast
lands,
that
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
exercised
its
full
authority
in
the
law
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
in
taylor
grazing
act
land,
the
government
has
done
something
less
than
make
this
full
exercise
of
its
power.
it
has
said
to
ranchers,
if
you
go
out
and
build
and
develop
a
ranch
and
that
what
occurred
in
this
instance
and
you
make
improvements,
we
will
rent
to
you
adjacent
lands
for
your
use
and
in
this
instance,
i
think
the
analogy
of
the
monongahela
case
which
we
cite
which
said,
i
believe
as
i
recall,
though
it
held
sometimes
basically
in
the
area
of
estoppel,
that
you
come
it
at
the
implied
or
expressed
invitation
of
the
government
in
making
improvement,
then
you
should
be
compensated
for
it,
that
is
an
exception
to
the
fast
land
cases.
the
twin
city
case
which
we
cited
to
the
court
in
our
brief,
specifically
holding
against
in
that
instance
the
land
owner
still
stood
for
the
proposition
that
if
there
is
this
implied
consent,
if
there
is
this
invitation
to
come
in
and
use
land,
then
the
government
must
take
you
as
it
finds
you
when
it
determines
compensation
for
a
taking.
we
feel
that
the
cases
cited
to
support
the
government's
position
deal
basically
with
loss
of
possible
future
opportunities
or
frustrated
business
opportunities
or
a
destruction
of
a
business
as
oppose
to
a
taking
of
land
or
possibly
the
loss
of
a
renewal
expectancy.
when
we
are
basically
talking
in
fuller
about
the
taking
of
a
thousand
acres
and
the
very
heart
of
a
cow/calf
operation
which
could
not
be
restored
after
the
taking,
and
that
this
operation
had
incidentally
to
its
use.
of
course,
it
was
lease
land.
it
was
there
and
existed,
the
government
leases
and
the
state
leases.
we
think
that
the
instruction
of
the
district
court
judge
was
a
fair
one
and
that
it
was
calculated
to
make
sure
that
the
owner
got
just
compensation,
not
a
subsidy,
but
simply
whatever
the
value
of
that
land
was
and
the
light
of
its
then
existing
use
and
to
the
light
of
the
adjacent
land
to
it.
the
government
is
not
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
well,
as
i
remarked
to
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
if
in
fact,
the
government
had
just
simply
said
to
us,
the
(inaudible)
says
of
no
more
lease
after
x
such
a
year,
the
rands
would
have
continued
in
operation.
it
was
designed
to
stay
there
and
it
would
have
continued
until
it
became
valuable
for
something
else
or
its
highest
and
best
use
became
apparent,
if
there
were
should
have
been
a
change.
the
testimony
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
am
not
certain
that
monetarily
the
outcome
would
have
been
any
different.
i
don't
believe
it
wouldn't
be.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
think
not.
in
this
respect,
the
court
would
then
undoubtedly
have
instructed,
we
have
the
fuller
fee
land
and
we
have
the
state
of
arizona
lease
land
and
you,
jury,
are
entitled
to
consider
the
use
of
the
fuller
ranch
with
state
land,
but
you
must
not
give
it
any
value.
basically,
the
same
instruction
that
was
given.
now
under
those
circumstances,
we
would
be
probably
right
back
up
here
because
the
government
i
am
sure
wouldn't
have
objected
to
that.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
but
i
think
it
also
tells
the
jury
that
if
you
feel
it
has
no
value
or
that
it's
detrimental
and
reduces
the
value
of
this
property
by
the
hazard
involved
of
the
cancellation,
you
can
take
that
into
consideration
too,
it
cuts
both
ways.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh,
and
the
government
did
too
at
great
length.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
indeed.
and
that
there
was
a
considerable
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
this
land
had
x
value
sir,
by
reason
of
the
fact
of
these
leases
and
they
are
intransigent
so
to
speak.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
absolutely.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
have
no
trouble
doing
that
except
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
we
would
be
out
as
far
as
any
fight
with
the
government
is
concern
at
all.
then
the
land
would
be
paid
for
on
whatever
basis,
a
jury
determined
was
adequate
and
real.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
don't
see
that
the
government
is
penalized
if
what
it
pays
is
fair
market
value.
the
government
would
be
penalized
if
it
paid
more
than
the
land
was
worth.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
on
the
contrary
i
think
i
made
a
bad
mistake.
i
think
in
the
trial
of
the
matter
i
got
considerably
more
money.
if
i
had
simply
went
in
and
said
this
is
as
it
was
a
unique
green
spot
in
the
middle
of
mojave
county,
the
driest
place
in
arizona,
we
have
a
natural
spring,
two
good
wells,
great
grass
producing
qualities
and
we
can
run
a
cow/calf
operation
on
this
thousand
acres.
i
made
a
bad
mistake.
i
should
have
got
about
$700,000.00.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
that
is
correct.
and
that
was
the
general
area.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
that's
why
i
said
i
think
a
bad
mistake.
i
feel
that
the
court's
instruction
hurt
me
and
that
it
reduced
the
value
and
i
say
that
tool
can
cut
both
ways
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
can
find
mr.
fuller
who
is
[laughter]
somewhere
out
looking
for
a
new
profession.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
really
don't
know
what
they
say,
because
each
of
the
four
men
i
believe
we
called
came
to
this
valuation
on
a
different
basis.
one
was
a
professional
appraiser,
one
was
the
owner,
one
was
a
rancher,
one
was
a
man
skilled
in
buying
and
selling
ranches.
each
came
up,
but
each
stated
to
the
court
and
jury
that
they
in
the
coming
to
the
final
value
that
they
put
on
the
land
did
not
consider
the
permit
land,
because
they
were
instructed
not
to,
and
they
deducted
it
from
any
value
that
they
put
on
the
total
property.
now
there
were
various
figures
in
the
trial
of
the
issue
that
they
gave
to
the
permits.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
the
government
appraiser
came
to
a
figure,
i
believe
of
a
$136,000.00
based
not
on
the
cow/calf
operation,
however,
but
based
i
think
upon
a
potential
resort,
a
treatment
of
some
area.
he
remarked
when
the
lake
was
there,
it
might
have
attractive
possibilities,
but
actually
the
truth
of
matter
that
the
ground
taken
was
all
going
to
be
underwater
as
the
lake
arose
and
subsided,
but
that
was
his
determination.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
not
a
permanent
lake.
it's
flood
control
dam
where
the
water
will
rise
and
recede
and
it's
for
flood
control
purposes
the
land
was
taken.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
as
a
matter
of
custom,
it
would
have
been
transferred
--
it
would
have
been
approved.
i
recall
at
no
time
when
it
hasn’t
been,
and
the
large
ranch
holdings
in
the
west
are
consistently
sold
small
fees,
50,
a
100,
200
acres
along
with
20,000
or
30,000
acres
of
permit
land
both
state
and
federal
and
the
transfer
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice
for
many,
many
years
has
been
approved.
that's
what
they
sell
basically.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
no,
i
think
they
just
can
go
down
and
get
verbal
confirmation
say
yes
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
they
know
the
powers,
they
are
not
to
approve.
they
accept
that
and
on
the
open
market,
the
property
has
a
considerably
a
larger
value,
but
then
they
are
considering
the
fee.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
a
number
of
years,
and
i
am
sorry
i
cannot
tell
your
mr.
justice
powell
the
exact
time,
but
he
had
built
over
a
period
of
a
number
of
years
the
total
ranch
property
including
wells,
and
houses,
ditches,
and
fencing.
it
had
been
i
think
--
it
was
nothing
of
recent,
it
took
him
a
number
of
years.
i
think
5
or
10
or
something
of
that
nature.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
has
indicated
to
the
court,
i
think
erroneously
that
--
and
perhaps
inadvertently
in
response
to
a
question
that
fuller
remained
in
business,
that
he
was
still
operating
around,
these
are
the
statements
there
as
the
record,
they
are
not
accurate
and
it
simply
points
up
the
danger
of
applying
the
rands
analogy
to
these
kind
of
cases.
i
hope
i
can
persuade
the
court
in
my
statement
to
you.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
only
that
i
think
that
the
possibilities
of
less
than
adequate
compensation
are
present
and
the
indication
would
be
with
counsel
saying
do
that
the
rands
is
still
in
existence
and
operating
is
not
effect.
matter
of
fact,
matter
was
that
the
compensation
that
was
received
wasn’t
enough
to
cover
the
existing
debts.
so
if
it’s
a
thing
the
court,
i
don’t
think
should
consider
in
any
event
that
it
was
there
and
the
statement
was
inaccurate
when
it
was
made
to
the
court.
the
u.s
versus
jaramillo
case
which
has
been
remarked
onto
the
court
in
oral
presentation
and
which
is
briefed
is
directly
in
point
with
fuller
as
we
understand
it,
and
i
think
it
stands
for
the
proposition,
not
as
counsel
has
stated
that
one
must
be
paid
or
subsidized,
but
that
it
simply
means
you
can
take
into
consideration
in
determining
the
market
value
of
a
ranch,
the
availability
and
the
accessibility
of
permit
land,
and
that's
really
all
that
the
court
instructed.
judge
craig
in
the
district
court
was
extremely
careful
not
to
distinguish
rands
which
he
didn't
know
about
at
the
time,
but
to
follow
jaramillo
which
we
consider
to
be
the
law
and
certainly
a
well
reasoned
conclusion.
he
did
tell
the
jury
as
we
have
pointed
out
to
you
that
they
must
recognize
the
possibility
of
government
revocation
of
the
permits
and
the
leases
and
incidentally
the
question
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
remarked
on,
there
was
state
land
involved
in
this.
there
was
30,000
acres
of
federal
lease
land,
12,000
acres
of
state
land
which
the
applicant
owned
and
approximately
1,200
acres
of
fee
land.
also,
there
was
some
indication
that
the
reason
bom
did
not
revoke
these
leases
was
the
remainder
of
the
fee
land.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
at
all.
it
was
isolated
across
the
river
and
it
couldn’t
be
made
accessible
under
any
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
the
judge
specifically
told
them
that
they
couldn't
consider
the
value
of
those
permits
either,
although
there
were
ten-year
leases
as
i
recall.
but
i
believe,
i
have
the
full
instructions
set
out
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
court
did
in
fact
specifically
state
that
the
jury
was
not
to
consider
any
value
given
to
state
or
federal
permits
as
the
case
maybe,
whether
they
were
taylor
grazing
act,
section
5
leases
or
state
of
arizona
land
leases
for
agricultural
purposes
or
grazing
purposes.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
somewhat
different,
mr.
chief
justice,
somewhat
different
simply
because
there
is
a
preference
in
arizona
that
i
am
unaware
of
whether
not
it
holds
over
in
taylor,
but
arizona,
if
the
state
needed
that
land
for
any
purpose
for
a
length
of
time
and
then
put
it
back
on
the
market,
the
preference
would
go
to
that
(inaudible)
who
had
been
the
prior
lessee
or
permittee.
but
nonetheless,
i
think
the
court
properly
instructed
and
the
jury
was
properly
aware
that
these
values,
if
there
was
any
value
in
the
permits,
must
not
be
considered
and
the
testimony
in
the
case
was
quite
clear
that
those
who
testified
as
the
value
distinguished
the
permit
land
and
reduced
the
total
value
of
the
fee
land
by
whatever
they
felt
was
the
value
of
the
permit
land.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
i
have
a
note
here
that
the
court
in
its
instruction
said,
give
to
the
fee
lands
such
value
as
the
availability
and
accessibility
of
the
permit
and
fee
land
might
create
in
conjunction
with
the
fee.
now
the
government
has
said
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
coincidently,
the
state
was
in
there
to
get
the
value
of
its
land
in
the
proceeding
also
and
that
was
a
separate
matter
which
was
settled
out
of
court
ultimately.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
permits
for
grazing
are
not
compensable
property
right,
but
we
do
not
agree
that
a
jury
must
to
take
a
legal
fiction
and
say
they
are
not
accessible,
they
are
not
available,
they
do
not
exist
when
in
fact
you
have
an
actual
operating
cow/calf
operation,
and
the
government
is
going
to
take
that
operation
and
leave
you
with
the
permits.
now
it
doesn't
then
make
a
fair
compensation.
it
certainly
doesn't
take
into
effect
the
work,
the
effort,
the
improvements
of
that
existing
cow/calf
operation
had
and
i
say
that
the
cow/calf
operation,
because
it's
distinguishing
factor.
this
was
not
some
lease
of
a
large
amount
of
federal
acreage
where
someone
run
a
steer
operation
on
the
permit
land,
bought
cows
or
calves
in
the
winter,
fed
them
during
the
spring
and
sold
them
in
early
summer.
as
the
record
revealed
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
understood,
the
fee
land
was
the
important
reason
for
the
existence
of
this
ranch.
you
will
have
two
wells
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
our
appraisers
and
their
testimony
simply
said,
the
permit
land
we
put
to
one
side.
the
fee
land
can
support
somewhere
between
800
and
1,000
cow
units
per
year
by
reason
of
its
accessibility
of
water,
its
fertileness,
its
bermuda
grass,
pastures,
its
alfalfa
crops.
we
can
support
x
number
of
cows,
if
you
allowed
us
to
consider
the
permit
land,
it
would
be
worth
this
much
more,
and
that's
how
the
testimony
went
and
that's
how
the
verdict
was
arrived
at.
they
did
not
consider
it.
the
permit
land
as
having
any
value
except
that
it
was
available
in
case
of
a
good
year,
you
could
put
those
cows
on
and
maybe
grow
more
fee.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
precisely.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
say
you
this,
and
perhaps
i
don’t
follow
mr,
justice
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
think
it
must
have
been.
simple
reason
that
all
of
our
experts
testified
that
the
property
had
a
considerably
larger
value
than
that.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh!
yes.
they
were
told
to
consider
the
availability
of
the
land,
its
accessibility,
but
to
give
it
no
value
in
coming
to
their
conclusion.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh,
yes.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
it's
a
side
and
i
believe
in
the
government's
brief
--
one
man
a
mr.
perry
who
was
an
appraiser
testified
would
be
i
think
it
worth
about
$1,150,000.00
with
the
permits
and
approximately
a
million
without
them.
he
gave
the
permits
--
the
permit
in
that
land
a
very
little
value,
about
a
$150,000.00
as
i
recall.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
in
the
sense
that
they
are
no
award
could
be
made
for
the
permit
land.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
would
agree
that
the
proceeding
was
to
determine
the
value
of
the
fee
land
and
that
determination
was
to
be
made
considering
the
use
it
was
put
to
and
the
accessibility
of
adjacent
lands
which
we
have
a
permit
for.
but
if
there
was
to
be
any
value
given
to
those
permit
lands,
it
could
not
be
translated
into
a
jury
award
and
the
court
is
right
there
to
tell
them
that
it
must
not
be.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
in
fact,
the
matter
of
value
was
quite
bitterly
fought.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
yes.
no,
in
our
case
there
was
a
great
hideous
between
the
appraisers
for
the
owner,
fuller
and
the
government.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
well,
we
wanted
to
make
sure
that
our
appraisers,
justice
rehnquist,
could
testify
as
to
what
in
fact
a
cow/calf
operation
was,
and
we
wanted
to
get
before
the
court
and
the
jury
as
much
information
as
possible
about
the
very
nature
of
the
operation.
it
was
completely
distinguishable
from,
as
i
have
indicated
to
you,
a
steer
operation.
we
felt
that
any
appraiser
that
got
in
and
i
simply
said,
i
looked
at
1,000
acres
of
land
without
understanding
what
it
was,
couldn't
come
up
with
an
intelligent
evaluation,
and
we
felt
that
that
kind
of
testimony
in
the
light
of
jaramillo
was
absolutely
a
necessity.
otherwise,
they
would
simply
have
been
saying,
we
have
a
1,200
acres
or
whatever
the
case
maybe
which
we
will
pretend
is
not
the
cow/calf
operation
which
is
its
highest
and
best
use.
i
might
at
this
point
digress
for
a
moment
and
remark
on
rands
and
its
ultimate
effect,
i
think
upon
ranchers
and
people
with
riparian
fast
land
holdings.
as
i
read
it,
the
government's
case
and
as
i
understand
their
position
in
this
matter,
their
position
basically
is
that
if
you
are
adjacent
in
the
case
of
rands
to
a
navigable
stream
or
body
of
water
and
you
own
fee
land
and
it
is
condemned
by
the
government,
then
you
cannot
consider
any
use
that
that
land
might
have
relating
to
accessibility
to
the
water,
to
the
navigable
stream
or
body
of
water.
and
counsel
says,
they
want
a
very
limited
interpretation
of
this
case
and
that
its
application
perhaps
by
assumption
and
would
be
limited.
but
in
all
the
western
states,
in
fact
all
of
the
states
in
the
country
bordering
on
big
rivers,
arizona,
particularly
where
i
come
has
the
colorado,
a
whole
city
has
been
built
on
the
colorado
on
fee
land,
secured
from
the
state
of
arizona,
and
they
call
it
havasu
city.
they
built
the
london
bridge
there.
that
use
is
specifically
because
the
colorado
river
is
there.
if
i
follow
the
government's
reasoning
and
the
application
of
rands,
what
they
are
saying
if
it
is
necessary
for
the
federal
government
to
go
to
havasu
city,
take
the
bridge,
the
houses,
the
resorts,
the
restaurants,
the
recreation
area
on
fee
land
immediately
adjacent
to
that
river,
but
solely
related
to
the
presence
of
that
river,
they
don't
have
to
pay
the
fair
market
value
of
that
land.
they
have
the
legal
fiction
that
because
it
is
adjacent
to
a
navigable
stream,
it
has
value
only
without
the
application
of
that
stream.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes
sir.
that's
how
rands
can
be
extended
as
i
read
it.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
no.
only
at
that
--
in
limited
areas.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
as
a
potential.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
that
is
correct.
if
we
have
that
was
the
potential
use.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
then,
they
pay
full
market
value
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
follow
you.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
in
that
instance,
rands
wouldn't
apply
in
any
event,
because
it
is
not
navigable
stream
as
you
understand.
that
wouldn't
be
the
case.
where
if
they
simply
took
the
dam
down
and
went
away,
property
owners
at
the
dams,
they
are
in
the
same
position
he
was
before.
he
was
received
nothing,
he
has
lost
nothing
because
that
has
occurred.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
our
situation
here
is
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
of
course,
as
they
came
and
took
the
land.
it
wasn't
the
matter
of
taking
away
the
facility.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
only
slightly
different.
we
would
then
be
talking
about
a
cow/calf
operation
with
12,000
state
acres.
as
the
case
was,
we
were
talking
about
a
cow/calf
operation
with
12,000
state
acres
and
32,000
federal
acres
immediately
adjacent
to
it.
so
it
would
only
been
a
small
matter
of
degree.
as
our
witnesses
testified
some
years
on
that
land
that
the
government
saves
as
valuable
subsidy.
you
are
lucky
if
you
can
run
a
cow
on
a
section
that
640
acres.
sometimes
maybe
you
get
a
cow
to
a
thousand
acres.
the
answer
if
the
government
feels
it's
being
undone
by
the
subsidy
to
simply
raise
the
rental
which
they
have
every
right
to
do.
we
have
made
comment
in
our
brief
to
the
court
that
there
is
another
point
to
be
considered
in
this
matter
and
that
is
simply
the
proposition
that
while
rands
may
control
the
compensation
under
a
taking
or
did
control
until
the
amendment
that
which
reduced
its
effectiveness
and
i
think
indicates
a
congressional
change
in
the
onerous
rule
of
rands
that
while
rands
may
control
as
to
riparian
fast
lands,
that
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
exercised
its
full
authority
in
the
law
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
in
taylor
grazing
act
land,
the
government
has
done
something
less
than
make
this
full
exercise
of
its
power.
it
has
said
to
ranchers,
if
you
go
out
and
build
and
develop
a
ranch
and
that
what
occurred
in
this
instance
and
you
make
improvements,
we
will
rent
to
you
adjacent
lands
for
your
use
and
in
this
instance,
i
think
the
analogy
of
the
monongahela
case
which
we
cite
which
said,
i
believe
as
i
recall,
though
it
held
sometimes
basically
in
the
area
of
estoppel,
that
you
come
it
at
the
implied
or
expressed
invitation
of
the
government
in
making
improvement,
then
you
should
be
compensated
for
it,
that
is
an
exception
to
the
fast
land
cases.
the
twin
city
case
which
we
cited
to
the
court
in
our
brief,
specifically
holding
against
in
that
instance
the
land
owner
still
stood
for
the
proposition
that
if
there
is
this
implied
consent,
if
there
is
this
invitation
to
come
in
and
use
land,
then
the
government
must
take
you
as
it
finds
you
when
it
determines
compensation
for
a
taking.
we
feel
that
the
cases
cited
to
support
the
government's
position
deal
basically
with
loss
of
possible
future
opportunities
or
frustrated
business
opportunities
or
a
destruction
of
a
business
as
oppose
to
a
taking
of
land
or
possibly
the
loss
of
a
renewal
expectancy.
when
we
are
basically
talking
in
fuller
about
the
taking
of
a
thousand
acres
and
the
very
heart
of
a
cow/calf
operation
which
could
not
be
restored
after
the
taking,
and
that
this
operation
had
incidentally
to
its
use.
of
course,
it
was
lease
land.
it
was
there
and
existed,
the
government
leases
and
the
state
leases.
we
think
that
the
instruction
of
the
district
court
judge
was
a
fair
one
and
that
it
was
calculated
to
make
sure
that
the
owner
got
just
compensation,
not
a
subsidy,
but
simply
whatever
the
value
of
that
land
was
and
the
light
of
its
then
existing
use
and
to
the
light
of
the
adjacent
land
to
it.
the
government
is
not
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
well,
as
i
remarked
to
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
if
in
fact,
the
government
had
just
simply
said
to
us,
the
(inaudible)
says
of
no
more
lease
after
x
such
a
year,
the
rands
would
have
continued
in
operation.
it
was
designed
to
stay
there
and
it
would
have
continued
until
it
became
valuable
for
something
else
or
its
highest
and
best
use
became
apparent,
if
there
were
should
have
been
a
change.
the
testimony
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
am
not
certain
that
monetarily
the
outcome
would
have
been
any
different.
i
don't
believe
it
wouldn't
be.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
think
not.
in
this
respect,
the
court
would
then
undoubtedly
have
instructed,
we
have
the
fuller
fee
land
and
we
have
the
state
of
arizona
lease
land
and
you,
jury,
are
entitled
to
consider
the
use
of
the
fuller
ranch
with
state
land,
but
you
must
not
give
it
any
value.
basically,
the
same
instruction
that
was
given.
now
under
those
circumstances,
we
would
be
probably
right
back
up
here
because
the
government
i
am
sure
wouldn't
have
objected
to
that.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
but
i
think
it
also
tells
the
jury
that
if
you
feel
it
has
no
value
or
that
it's
detrimental
and
reduces
the
value
of
this
property
by
the
hazard
involved
of
the
cancellation,
you
can
take
that
into
consideration
too,
it
cuts
both
ways.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
oh,
and
the
government
did
too
at
great
length.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
yes,
indeed.
and
that
there
was
a
considerable
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
this
land
had
x
value
sir,
by
reason
of
the
fact
of
these
leases
and
they
are
intransigent
so
to
speak.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
absolutely.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
have
no
trouble
doing
that
except
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
we
would
be
out
as
far
as
any
fight
with
the
government
is
concern
at
all.
then
the
land
would
be
paid
for
on
whatever
basis,
a
jury
determined
was
adequate
and
real.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
don't
see
that
the
government
is
penalized
if
what
it
pays
is
fair
market
value.
the
government
would
be
penalized
if
it
paid
more
than
the
land
was
worth.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
on
the
contrary
i
think
i
made
a
bad
mistake.
i
think
in
the
trial
of
the
matter
i
got
considerably
more
money.
if
i
had
simply
went
in
and
said
this
is
as
it
was
a
unique
green
spot
in
the
middle
of
mojave
county,
the
driest
place
in
arizona,
we
have
a
natural
spring,
two
good
wells,
great
grass
producing
qualities
and
we
can
run
a
cow/calf
operation
on
this
thousand
acres.
i
made
a
bad
mistake.
i
should
have
got
about
$700,000.00.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
that
is
correct.
and
that
was
the
general
area.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
that's
why
i
said
i
think
a
bad
mistake.
i
feel
that
the
court's
instruction
hurt
me
and
that
it
reduced
the
value
and
i
say
that
tool
can
cut
both
ways
sir.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
can
find
mr.
fuller
who
is
[laughter]
somewhere
out
looking
for
a
new
profession.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
i
really
don't
know
what
they
say,
because
each
of
the
four
men
i
believe
we
called
came
to
this
valuation
on
a
different
basis.
one
was
a
professional
appraiser,
one
was
the
owner,
one
was
a
rancher,
one
was
a
man
skilled
in
buying
and
selling
ranches.
each
came
up,
but
each
stated
to
the
court
and
jury
that
they
in
the
coming
to
the
final
value
that
they
put
on
the
land
did
not
consider
the
permit
land,
because
they
were
instructed
not
to,
and
they
deducted
it
from
any
value
that
they
put
on
the
total
property.
now
there
were
various
figures
in
the
trial
of
the
issue
that
they
gave
to
the
permits.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
the
government
appraiser
came
to
a
figure,
i
believe
of
a
$136,000.00
based
not
on
the
cow/calf
operation,
however,
but
based
i
think
upon
a
potential
resort,
a
treatment
of
some
area.
he
remarked
when
the
lake
was
there,
it
might
have
attractive
possibilities,
but
actually
the
truth
of
matter
that
the
ground
taken
was
all
going
to
be
underwater
as
the
lake
arose
and
subsided,
but
that
was
his
determination.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
not
a
permanent
lake.
it's
flood
control
dam
where
the
water
will
rise
and
recede
and
it's
for
flood
control
purposes
the
land
was
taken.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
as
a
matter
of
custom,
it
would
have
been
transferred
--
it
would
have
been
approved.
i
recall
at
no
time
when
it
hasn’t
been,
and
the
large
ranch
holdings
in
the
west
are
consistently
sold
small
fees,
50,
a
100,
200
acres
along
with
20,000
or
30,000
acres
of
permit
land
both
state
and
federal
and
the
transfer
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice
for
many,
many
years
has
been
approved.
that's
what
they
sell
basically.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
no,
i
think
they
just
can
go
down
and
get
verbal
confirmation
say
yes
--
mr.
frank
haze
burch
they
know
the
powers,
they
are
not
to
approve.
they
accept
that
and
on
the
open
market,
the
property
has
a
considerably
a
larger
value,
but
then
they
are
considering
the
fee.
mr.
frank
haze
burch
a
number
of
years,
and
i
am
sorry
i
cannot
tell
your
mr.
justice
powell
the
exact
time,
but
he
had
built
over
a
period
of
a
number
of
years
the
total
ranch
property
including
wells,
and
houses,
ditches,
and
fencing.
it
had
been
i
think
--
it
was
nothing
of
recent,
it
took
him
a
number
of
years.
i
think
5
or
10
or
something
of
that
nature.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
