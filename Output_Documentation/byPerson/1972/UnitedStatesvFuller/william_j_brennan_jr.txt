justice
william
j.
brennan,

suppose
the
government,
the
federal
government
had
improved
the
land
now
being
taken
say
with
an
expense
of
irrigation
system
or
something
like
that,
and
now
the
united
states
wants
to
take
the
land.
would
you
be
making
the
argument
you
are
as
to
the
enhancement
of
the
value?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
you
distinguish
that
in
your
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i
was
thinking
of
it
mr.
sachse
used
to
be
two,
i
don’t
know
that
still
is.
in
the
rural
county
which
i
lived
in
new
jersey,
united
states
government
used
to
finance
the
digging
of
ponds
and
the
irrigation
in
that
way
on
the
local
farms
in
the
county.
nothing
like
these
(inaudible)
farm
in
the
western
states
of
smaller
farms.
they
certainly
added
a
good
deal
of
the
value
of
that
farm.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
suggesting
the
$350,000.00
award
has
nothing
in
it
for
the
enhancement
because
of
permit
land?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
what
you
just
said
that
a
lot
of
testimony
that
without
laying
a
permit
land
aside,
because
of
the
water
and
the
number
of
head
and
everything
else,
and
i
was
wondering
if
you
were
implying
in
saying
that;
that
the
$350,000.00
verdict
was
arrived
at
without
reference
to
the
value
of
it.
