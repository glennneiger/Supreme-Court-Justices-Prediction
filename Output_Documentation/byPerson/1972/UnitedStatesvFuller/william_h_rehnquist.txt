justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it’s
your
contention,
i
take
it
that
the
department
--
was
it,
agriculture
or
interior?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
department
of
the
interior
will
not
take
a
jaundiced
view
of
the
renewal
of
his
permit
because
he
has
less
fee
land
now
than
he
did
before?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
nonetheless,
congress
gets
its
way
in
this
case
because
as
you
say
congress
can
grant
more
than
the
fifth
amendment
requires
it
to
give?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sachse,
(inaudible)
to
start
with
this
question.
you
stated
that
this
is
a
type
of
right
that
the
government
ordinarily
accords
only
to
contiguous
owners,
and
i
take
it
there
is
also
a
right
that
is
a
property
right
that
vests
in
this
individual
himself
as
opposed
to
the
general
public’s
right
to
go
on
other
parts
of
the
public
domain.
don’t
you
think
that
makes
it
a
little
different
from
rands
where
i
take
it
the
right
of
access
to
the
navigation
was
only
in
common
with
the
general
public?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
less
than
a
property
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
at
least
the
holding
in
jaramillo
is
dead
duck,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
burch,
how
is
the
state
land
treated
in
the
judge's
charge
of
the
jury,
if
it
was
treated
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state
and
federal
permit
lands
were
treated
alike
then
for
purpose
of
fixing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
exactly
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
burch,
i
take
this
--
the
giving
of
this
instruction
by
judge
craig
was
quite
closely
contested
with
the
government
objecting
this.
why
did
you
insist
on
handing
that
instruction
if
in
fact
your
appraisers
didn't
need
it
or
am
i
wrong
in
taking
you
are
saying
your
appraisers
didn't
need
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
burch,
on
the
theory
that
your
appraisers
took,
and
that
was
a
adopted
at
least
in
part
by
the
jury,
if
they
were
comparing
the
fee
land
as
it
was
before
this
taking
with
permits
in
existence
and
the
fee
land
and
the
situation
were
that
the
government
have
revoked
the
taylor
grazing
act
permit.
wouldn't
those
appraisers
have
had
to
say
that
the
value
in
the
second
situation
was
less
than
the
first,
even
though
they
are
just
valuing
the
fee
land?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
would
be
error
only
if
some
appraiser
had
in
effect,
indicated
he
had
done
so
or
as
counsel
argued
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
true
in
most
condemnation
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it’s
your
contention,
i
take
it
that
the
