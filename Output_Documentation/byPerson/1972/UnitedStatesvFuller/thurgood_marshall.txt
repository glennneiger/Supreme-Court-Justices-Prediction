the
only
point
is
a
gift
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
kind
of
interest?
suppose
the
state
own
this
land
and
had
the
exact
same
agreement
with
mr.
fuller,
would
you
recognize
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
your
point
isn’t
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
gave
him
this
gift,
is
if
anybody
gave
it
to
them.
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
have
to
go
that
far.
justice
thurgood
marshall

in

time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
burch,
did
you
say
that
they
instructed
the
jury
to
consider
the
accessibility
and
availability,
but
to
give
it
no
value?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
could
you
consider
if
you
didn't
give
it
some
value?
this
whole
proceeding
is
value
and
money
and
bucks,
that's
all
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
during
the
case,
the
us
attorney
had
said
that
we
have
revoked
to
permit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
put
on
testimony
and
said
it's
now
revoked?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
