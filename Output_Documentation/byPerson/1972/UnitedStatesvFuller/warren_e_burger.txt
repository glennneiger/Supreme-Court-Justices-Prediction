chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-559,
united
states
against
fuller.
mr.
sachse?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
this
other
situation,
i
suppose
if
a
man
has
a
home
overlooking
rock
creek
park
either
in
washington
or
up
the
platonic
on
the
palace
aids
area,
the
view
that
he
has
contributes
to
the
--
enhances
the
value
of
the
real
estate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
doesn’t
give
him
any
absolute
right
to
the
view
or
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
government
might
come
along
and
put
a
dam
right
there
and
spoil
his
view
without
giving
him
any
right,
i
assume
to
recover
for
spoiling
his
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
pick
up
after
lunch
at
that
point.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
sachse,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
say,
if
the
grazing
land
is
taken
first,
you're
not
using
that
phrase
as
a
word
of
art
to
constitutional
taking,
are
you?
you
mean
if
they
terminate
first
or
if
it
had
expired
and
refused
to
renew
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
we
would
take
the
fee
under
the
conventional
taking
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
say
there
is
nothing
to
take,
that’s
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
most
often
--
most
often
such
an
improvement
if
you
would
call
it
that
is
one
of
which
is
shared
in
common
by
great
many
people,
perhaps
people
of
different
places,
but
if
a
new
lake
is
created
for
example
by
backing
up
water
with
the
dam,
enhances
the
value
of
lake
shore,
creates
lake
shore
a
property
out
of
which
once
was
a
pasture.
so
that
that’s
something
you
shared
in
common
with
the
great
many
people,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tank
you
mr.
sachse.
mr.
burch?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
it
really
make
any
difference
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
he
is
still
there
or
whether
he
is
gone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
where
those
ten-year
leases
terminable
by
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
puts
them
in
the
same
posture
as
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
stipulation
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
am
i
mistaken
that
there
was
a
stipulation
on
this
subject
somewhere
on
the
values?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
i
think
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
in
subsequent
case
that
they
have
a
stipulation
on
alternative
values?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
this
is
river
that
you
speak
about
in
arizona,
a
man-made
river?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
you
had
a
man-made
river,
dam
and
usual
backup
of
water
as
with
many
of
these
projects
and
you
had
great
enhancement
of
the
value
of
the
land,
the
cities
grew
up,
resorts
and
then
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
united
states
government,
decides
that
for
environmental
reasons
or
others,
they
are
going
to
terminate
the
dam.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
terminate
the
dam,
because
the
water
goes
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we're
talking
about
the
water
going
away.
the
government
put
it
there,
and
now
the
government
is
taking
it
away.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whatever
he
got,
he
got
for
nothing
and
whatever
is
taken
away
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
their
lost?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
you
concede
that
if
the
government
had
refused
to
renew
the
permit,
at
the
terminal
point
a
few
months
before
that
the
situation
would
be
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
justice
marshall
put
it
to
you,
how
can
you
consider
this
element
if
you
don't
take
it
into
account
and
give
some
value
on
it?
what's
the
meaning,
the
real
meaning
of
that
instruction
in
the
minds
of
the
jurors
who
hear
it?
isn't
it
a
really
a
contradictory
thing
in
light
of
what
you
saying?
doesn't
it
tell
the
jury,
you
can
weigh
the
value
of
that
taylor
grazing
land?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
judge
tell
him
about
the
hazard
of
cancellation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
arguments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
the
solution
to
the
problem
simple
for
the
government,
if
you
are
right
by
having
the
government
pay
careful
attention
to
its
taylor
grazing
permits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
terminate
them
all
well
in
advance
of
any
contemplated
taking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
would
be
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
so
the
consequences
of
that
position
really
is,
isn't
it
that
because
the
government
allows
the
ranchers
and
farmers
to
use
the
land
right
up
to
the
time
of
the
actual
taking,
the
government
is
penalized
for
its
policy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
--
i
take
it
to
you'd
agree
that
you
wouldn't
have
gone
any
such
award
as
you
received
here
if
the
government
had
canceled
or
refuse
to
renew
the
taylor
permits
six
months
or
a
year
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
government’s
testimony
on
the
value
of
land
without
taylor
grazing
permits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sachse,
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
in
mind
what
mr.
fuller's
experts
value
on
the
fee
land
alone
amounted
to,
something
over
million
dollars?
it
would
have
been
an
enormously
high
acre
per
acre
figure,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
acres
of
fee
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
920,
wasn't
it?
so
that
it
was
something
approaching
a
thousand
dollars
an
acre
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
sachse.
thank
you
mr.
fuller.
mr.

the
case
