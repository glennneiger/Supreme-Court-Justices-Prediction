mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
court,
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
suit
was
brought
there
to
set
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
it
involves
questions
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
other
interrelated
questions.
i
am
representing
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
mr.
cox
is
representing
the
appellant
railroads
in
number
72-562.
we
have
filed
separate
briefs,
but
there
is
no
diversions
between
our
positions.
the
setting
of
the
stage
for
this
case
began
in
december
1971,
when
the
nation's
railroads
requested
special
permission
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
authorize
on
short
notice,
a
two-and-a-half
percent
surcharge
on
nearly
all
freight
rates
across
the
board.
they
asked
that
this
be
affective
on
january
1,
1972.
the
commission
disallowed
this
request
on
the
ground
that
there
was
inadequate
notice,
but
it
allowed
the
carriers
to
refile
the
proposal
to
be
affective
on
not
less
than
30
days
notice,
and
the
carriers
did
refile
on
january
5,
1972
asking
that
the
two-and-half-percent
surcharge
become
affective
on
february
5.
under
section
3
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
a
rate
proposed
by
a
carrier
becomes
affective
unless
the
commission
suspends
it
within
30
days.
and
this
suspension
pending
on
investigation
under
section
15(7)
is
effective
for
a
maximum
period
of
seven
months
after
which
the
carrier
may
put
the
rate
into
affect
unless
the
commission
prior
to
that
date
has
completed
its
investigation
and
affirmatively
found
that
the
proposed
rate
is
unlawful.
in
this
case,
during
the
30-day
period
protests
were
filed
by
shippers
and
other
interested
parties
and
environmental
groups,
including
the
named
appellee
here,
scrap
opposed
the
surcharge
on
the
ground
that
the
prevailing
rates
structure
discourages
the
movement
of
recyclable
goods
and
that
an
across-the-board
surcharge
would
further
discourage
recycling.
the
commission
found
that
the
railroads
had
a
critical
need
for
additional
revenue
and
concluded
that
the
proposed
surcharge
should
not
be
suspended.
it
ordered
the
carriers,
however,
to
publish
permanent
increased
rates
no
later
than
june
5,
1972
and
provided
that
the
authority
to
collect
the
two-and-half
percent
surcharge
would
expire
on
that
date.
the
commission
also
specifically
found
that
the
temporary
surcharge
would
appear
to
have
no
significant
adverse
effect
on
the
environment
within
the
meaning
of
the
environmental
policy
act
and
there
was
evidence
before
the
commission
to
support
that
finding.
the
carriers
then
filed
proposed
selective
increases
averaging
4.1%
and
protests
were
filed.
on
april
24,
1972,
the
commission
instituted
an
investigation
into
the
lawfulness
of
the
selective
increases
and
suspended
them
for
the
statutory
seven
month
period
under
section
15(7).
at
the
same
time
it
authorized
the
railroads
to
continue
to
collect
the
two-and-half
percent
surcharge
until
the
end
of
the
suspension
period
which
was
november
30,
1972.
a
few
days
later
on
may
12,
1972
this
suit
was
files
by
scrap
and
on
june
1st,
the
environmental
defense
fund
and
other
environmental
groups
intervened
as
plaintiffs.
various
defenses
to
the
suit
were
advanced,
but
these
were
rejected
by
the
district
court
and
on
july
10,
1972
that
court
added
an
injunction
by
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
restrained
from
permitting
the
railroads
to
collect
the
surcharge
and
the
railroads
are
enjoined
from
collecting
it
insofar
as
it
relates
to
goods
being
transported
for
purposes
of
recycling.
as
a
result,
surcharge
is
now
being
collected
on
recyclable
materials.
i
have
stated
the
basic
facts
without
bringing
in
the
legal
issues.
these
are
numerous
and
somewhat
intertwined.
questions
relating
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
procedures
of
the
commission
will
be
presented
by
mr.
cox.
i
would
like
to
repeat
though
that
there
is
no
difference
between
our
positions
either
in
substance
or
approach
and
i
want
to
claim
the
benefit
of
any
argument
that
he
will
make.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
first
issue
in
the
case
to
which
i
will
turn
is
the
familiar
question
of
standing.
we
have
a
rather
remarkable
situation
here.
five
law
school
students
though
i
am
told
they
are
changing
groups,
some
of
them
have
graduated
and
some
others
have
taken
their
places,
but
i
understand
there
are
still
five,
proceeding
not
as
lawyers,
but
as
plaintiffs
though
not
as
tax
payers,
have
tied
up
all
the
railroads
in
the
country
and
with
aid
of
the
district
court
have
prevented
the
railroads
from
collecting
from
$500,000
to
$1,000,000
a
month
for
the
past
eight
months
on
shipments
of
recyclable
materials.
they
have
been
joined
by
several
environmental
groups,
but
the
latter
make
no
different
allegations
and
the
case
may
be
treated
on
the
basis
of
the
position
relied
on
by
scrap.
just
last
thursday,
the
district
court
did
grant
a
motion
to
intervene
by
the
associate
--
national
association
of
secondary
industries,
inc,
which
is
an
organization
which
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
in
this
court,
the
light
green
a
brief
amicus
curiae.
now,
the
order
wasn't
filed
with
the
clerk
until
friday
and
we
didn't
hear
about
it
until
monday.
i
don't
think
that
has
any
relation
to
the
case
which
is
pending
before
the
court
on
appeal
and
in
any
event
insofar
as
these
people
are
shippers,
they
would
appear
to
be
clearly
are
not
entitled
to
the
equitable
relief
which
is
the
only
thing
involved
here.
after
all,
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
granting
of
a
preliminary
injunction
because
they
would
have
a
plain
and
adequate
remedy
at
law
by
way
of
review
of
the
rate
order
of
the
commission.
the
allegations
of
scrap
appear
at
pages
8
to
10
of
the
appendix,
particularly
on
page,
the
bottom
half
of
page
9.
they
allege
that
each
member
of
scrap,
although
we
have
now
some
new
members
who
apparently
have
not
formally
joined
in
this
petition,
each
member
of
scrap
has
been
caused
to
pay
more
for
finished
products
purchased
in
the
marketplace,
made
more
expensive
by
both
non-use
of
recycle
materials
on
their
manufacture
and
the
need
to
use
comparatively
more
energy
and
the
reduction
of
a
raw
material
to
finished
the
products
and
two
uses,
the
forests,
rivers,
streams,
mountains
and
other
natural
resources
surrounding
the
washington
metropolitan
area
and
at
his
legal
residence
for
camping,
hiking,
fishing,
site-seeing
and
other
recreational
or
aesthetic
purposes
and
passing
to
the
third
has
been
and
continue
to
be
exposed
to
the
quality
of
the
air
within
the
washington
metropolitan
area
and
their
legal
residence.
now,
it
will
be
seen
that
these
allegations
are
entirely
general.
it
is
not
said,
which
forests,
rivers,
streams
or
mountain?
we
don't
even
have
a
particular
valley
as
we
did
in
the
mineral
king
case
last
year.
which
forest,
stream,
river
or
mountain
is
used
by
any
members
scrap,
it
is
obvious
that
these
allegations
could
be
made
by
any
member
of
the
public,
who
wishes
to
make.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
not
only
didn't
take
testimony,
but
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
their
standing
and
the
position
of
scrap
in
their
motion
that
dismiss
is
that
such
evidence
was
unnecessary.
district
court
didn't
require
any
proof,
even
of
these
allegations
and
quoting
from
their
motion
to
affirm,
scrap
said
that
proof
of
its
injuries
is
unnecessary
for
purpose
of
standing
and
it
also
said
that
it
was
a
and
i
am
quoting
that
it
was
obvious,
that
is
their
word,
that
scrap
could
not
and
i
quote,
“prove
the
amount
of
additional
pollution
in
the
washington
d.c.
area
created
by
the
latest
icc
railroad
rate
increase.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
shippers
whose
rates
were
increased
would
have
standing.
i
am
not
sure
that
anyone
would
have
standing
to
obtain
an
injunction
in
this
case.
that
is
a
question
which
interrelates
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
argument
that
mr.
cox
is
going
to
make.
there
are
those
who
feel
that
standing
is
no
longer
a
relevant
argument,
though
i
wonder
if
our
predecessors
were
always
that
wrong.
in
another
case,
judge
gisele
in
this
district,
nearly
two
years
ago
said,
in
recent
years,
the
supreme
court
has
greatly
expanded
the
concept
of
standing
and
in
this
circuit,
the
concept
has
now
been
almost
completely
abandoned
and
similarly
in
a
recent
article
in
the
cincinnati
law
review,
the
author
concludes
with
this
statement,
“the
law
would
be
so
much
better
if
the
courts
got
directly
on
with
the
task
of
deciding
the
merits
of
the
claims
presented
without
passing
on
the
merits
of
the
plaintiff
presenting
them.”
now,
there
is
a
certain
simple
appeal
in
that
and
it
may
represent
the
wave
of
the
future,
but
it
is
a
serious
step,
the
implications
of
which
should
be
carefully
explored
and
considered.
before
going
further,
i
may
observe
that
if
there
is
standing
in
this
case,
it
would
be
helpful,
i
think
and
a
contribution
to
candor,
if
this
court
would
indicate
that
standing
is
no
longer
required,
for
to
say
that
standing
is
required
and
that
there
is
standing
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
so,
mr.
justice.
the
united
states
has
standing
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
a
state
–
a
state
might
well
have
the
standing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
there
are
many
situations
under
which
the
united
states
would
have
standing
to
enforce
matters
relating
to
environmental
protection,
particularly
in
view
of
the
statute
which
congress
has
enacted
stating
the
policy
of
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
person
who
had
business
interest
would
have
standing,
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
limited
to
a
dollar
amount
as
in
sierra
club
against
morton.
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart
it
was
recognized
that
aesthetic
interests
could
affect
it.
as,
for
example,
a
person
who
owns
a
piece
of
land
and
in
violation
of
an
environmental
statute,
his
view
is
going
to
be
obstructed,
even
though
it
might
not
have
a
--
it
just
happened
to
be
a
sentimental
view
that
he
had
reason
to
like,
but
it
affects
him.
it
isn't
something
that
deals
with
the
public
in
general.
standing
is
not
a
fiction
and
never
has
been
and
should
not
be.
if
anyone
has
standing
to
bring
a
suit
like
this,
it
will
mark
a
substantial
shift
in
the
balance
under
our
traditional
and
constitutional
separation
of
powers
where
this
is
what
the
constitution
meant
by
cases
or
controversies,
to
which
the
judicial
power
is
extended.
if
everyone
is
a
private
attorney
general,
free
to
raise
any
public
question
at
his
whim
or
because
of
his
academic
or
abstract
interest,
more
and
more
questions
will
be
thrown
into
the
courts
and
we
can
readily
have
a
situation
where
every
facet
of
our
governmental
operation
depends
on
the
later
hindrance
of
the
courts
wherein
affect
the
courts
would
take
over
all
the
details
of
the
administration
of
the
government.
in
my
view,
that
would
not
be
good
for
the
courts
and
it
would
not
be
good
for
the
country.
perhaps,
more
pertinent,
it
is
not
the
the
sort
of
division
of
function
which
was
intended
by
the
framers
as
i
see
it,
when
they
established
the
constitution.
i
don't
want
to
argue
another
case,
but
this
court
last
monday
granted
certiorari
in
united
states
against
richardson,
which
is
a
clear
illustration
of
the
type
of
question
which
will
arise
if
there
is
standing
in
a
case
like
this.
it
may
seem
very
fine
to
some
today
to
have
the
courts
decide
all
the
legal
questions,
often
pretty
much
in
advance
and
in
the
absence
of
concrete
facts
as
is
the
situation
here.
for
the
courts
today
are
progressive
and
forward
looking
and
innovative,
but
it
has
not
always
been
so.
there
have
been
times
when
the
courts
were
felt
by
way
and
be
backward
looking
and
obstructive
and
serious
attacks
on
the
courts
have
occurred.
of
course,
the
court
should
do
their
duty.
they
should
exercise
a
judicial
power
without
fear
or
favor,
but
the
judicial
power
does
not
authorize
a
general
overriding
sort
of
oversight
of
all
legal
questions
arising
in
the
government,
a
sort
of
ombudsman
to
whom
all
may
resort
when
they
feel
so
impelled.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
judicial
power
was
extended
to
cases
of
controversies
and
that
should
mean
bona
fide
disputes
by
a
party
who
has
a
real
stake
and
who
can
show
how
he
has
been
hurt.
that
is
not
this
case
with
respect
to
any
of
the
appellees.
i
turn
now
to
one
of
the
substantive
questions
in
this
case,
namely
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
its
application
to
the
action
of
the
icc
which
has
been
enjoined
here.
we
start
with
the
procedure
long
established
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
as
indicated
in
the
previous
case
and
as
i
have
said,
the
commission
is
given
broad
power
to
suspend,
propose
rates
but
it
has
only
30
days
within
which
to
take
this
action
and
under
section
15(7),
it
has
only
seven
months
after
suspension
to
act
on
the
proposed
rates.
if
the
commission
has
not
acted
within
seven
months,
the
new
rates
go
into
effect.
on
january
1,
1970,
the
president
signed
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
this
is
obviously
a
statute
to
great
importance.
establishing
a
clearly
stated
public
policy
and
it
is
obviously
to
be
taken
seriously
by
all
agencies
of
the
government.
it
was
enacted
in
sweeping,
but
rather
general
terms.
the
act
established
a
council
on
environmental
quality
with
explicit
duties
in
the
areas
of
research
and
investigation
into
environmental
quality
and
the
council
has
issued
guidelines
under
the
act,
which
are
set
out
at
pages
43
to
54
of
our
brief,
but
the
council
has
no
administrative
responsibilities.
it
decides
no
cases
and
issues
no
orders
to
agencies
or
parties
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
judicial
review
of
any
action
or
non-action.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
can't
be
judicial
review.
i
am
merely
observing
that
the
statute
though
sweeping,
is
not
particularly
articulated,
is
cast
in
very
general
terms
and
obviously
requires
some
construing.
when
we
look
at
the
environment
statute
itself,
section
102
c,
1022
c,
which
is
on
page
42
of
our
brief,
we
find
that
it
applies
to
legislative
proposals
which
are
not
involved
here
and
then
the
keywords
are
major
federal
action.
if
major
federal
actions,
if
they
are
ones
“significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.”
thus,
we
have
at
the
threshold
two
phrases
which
require
the
consideration
of
this
court.
there
is
another
phrase
at
the
beginning
of
section
102
that
i
will
mention
later
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
and
it
seems
to
me
in
large
measures
this
part
of
this
case
turns
on
the
construction
which
this
court
gives
to
those
three
phrases.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
limits
these
phrases
to
any
particular
agencies
or
types
of
agencies.
for
example,
literally,
the
statutes
applies
to
decisions
of
this
court
and
if
so,
after
all
this
court
is
a
federal
agency
and
if
this
court
takes
an
action,
it
then
well
be
a
major
federal
action,
if
so
construed,
would
require
the
court
to
issue
an
environmental
impact
statement
after
consulting
all
interested
federal
agencies
before
making
any
decision
which
could
the
affect
the
environment
and
under
the
regulations
of
the
council
on
environmental
quality,
this
process
could
take
at
least
four
months
and
probably
a
good
year
longer.
as
i
have
said,
what
this
court
does
is
often
major
federal
action
and
what
it
does
may
affect
the
environment.
for
example,
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
or
in
last
term,
sierra
club
case
or
in
a
case
involving
school
busing,
might
as
least
arguably
has
a
significant
environmental
affect.
now,
i
hasten
to
make
it
plain
that
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
apply
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
i
do
suggest
that
reaching
that
result
takes
some
construing.
in
the
light
of
the
whole
setting,
it
is
right
and
sound,
i
think
that
to
conclude
that
by
the
words,
major
federal
actions
in
the
statute,
congress
did
not
mean
to
include
decisions
of
this
court.
though
there
is
no
definition
of
a
federal
agency
or
anything
like
that
which
excludes
this
court,
even
though,
they
are
obviously
federal
action
and
may
often
be
major.
if
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
such
a
limitations
and
i
think
it
is
and
must
be,
then
it
becomes
necessary
to
consider
the
statute
in
its
application
in
other
set
of
things.
our
submission
is
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
the
national
environmental
policy
act
was
not
intended
to
displace
the
interstate
commerce
act
when
the
application
of
nepa
is
not
feasible
in
the
light
of
the
scheme
for
prompt
action
established
by
the
commerce
act.
now,
this
result
requires
no
straining
of
the
statutory
language.
for
section
102
itself
starts
out
with
the
provision
that
the
policies
of
nepa
are
to
be
applied
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
where
as
a
practical
matter,
the
application
of
the
nepa
procedures
is
not
possible
because
of
the
time
limitations
and
the
operative
statutes,
nepa
should
not
be
construed
to
require.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
to
suspension
orders,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
as
to
the
--.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
as
to
their
final
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
may
will
develop
the
materials
which,
as
a
part
of
their
final
action,
will
include
an
appropriate
environmental
protection
statement.
the
commission
does
not
take
the
position
that
nepa
is
never
applicable
to
the
commission,
but
only
that
it
is
not
applicable
to
suspension
orders
which
must
be
acted
on
within
30
days.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
they
do
or
do
not,
they
must
do
one
or
the
other
within
30
days.
if
the
commission
doesn't
act
within
30
days,
the
new
rate
goes
into
effect.
if
section
1022
(c)
is
applicable,
it
requires
the
preparation
of
an
elaborate
environmental
impact
statement,
the
elaboration
of
which
is
apparent
from
the
material
in
the
statute
on
page
43
of
our
brief
which
i
won't
take
time
to
read,
but
which
shows
that
it
is
a
very
large
indication
--
undertaking.
the
guidelines
issued
by
the
council
which
were
suggested
in
the
committee
reports
of
both
houses
of
congress
is
not
something
that
the
council
made
overly
elaborate.
the
guidelines
indicate
that
environmental
impact
statement
should
be
issued
in
two
stages.
first,
a
draft
should
be
prepared
by
the
agency
involved,
then
it
is
provided
in
the
statute
it
should
be
reviewed
by
other
agencies,
federal,
state
and
local
which
have
special
interest
or
expertise.
the
council
suggests
that
90
days
be
allowed
fro
this
process.
the
draft
is
also
available
to
citizens
for
comments.
the
agency
then
prepares
a
final
statement
in
the
light
of
all
the
comments
that
it
receives.
it
then
issues
a
statement
and
makes
it
available
to
the
council
on
environmental
quality
and
the
public.
it
is
not
to
take
any
administrative
action
for
30
days
thereafter
in
making
the
statement,
it
is
further
enjoined
by
the
statute
in
very
comprehensive
terms
which
appear
at
the
bottom
of
page
33
and
top
of
page
34
of
our
brief.
it
is
required
to
utilize
a
systematic
interdisciplinary
approach
which
will
ensure
that
integrated
use
of
the
natural
and
social
sciences
and
the
environmental
design
arts
in
planning
and
decision
making,
which
may
have
an
impact
on
man's
environment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
–
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
environmental
fine
arts
is
not
defined.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
applies
to
anything
to
which
it
applies,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
in
very
broad
and
sweeping
area.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
argument,
no
doubt,
will
be
made
under
this
statute
that
at
some
point.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
no,
mr.
justice.
that
is
the
position
of
the
commission
that
that
is
what
they
did.
actually,
what
they
did
was
to
say,
we
will
not
suspend
it,
but
you
must,
within
a
fixed
time,
propose
permanent
rates
and
we
will
then
terminate
the
suspension
when
your
permanent
upgrades
going
to
affect.
so,
it
was
a
conditional
non-suspension.
it
wasn't
simply
we
don't
suspend
which
would
have
put
the
two-and-a-half
percent
increase
into
effect.
the
commission
has,
it
has
to
consider
suspension
orders
in
approximately
4000
cases
a
year.
the
commission
was
obviously
confronted
with
the
task
of
determining
its
duty
in
the
light
of
the
two
statutes
taken
together.
by
its
own
terms,
nepa
is
applicable
only
to
actions
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment
and
in
this
case,
the
commission
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
proposed
across
the
board
temporary
surcharge,
“will
have
no
significant
adverse
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.”
the
court
below
said
that
this
finding
appears
to
be
no
more
than
glorified
border
play.
perhaps,
it
did
not
adequately
recognized
the
commission's
experience
in
the
field,
nor
its
standing
as
a
co-ordinating
agency
of
the
government
seeking
to
comply
with
its
duty
under
provision
to
two
statutes
which
are
surely
not
wholly
clear
in
their
interrelations.
now,
it
is
obvious
that
nepa
can't
be
complied
with
fully
within
30
days.
the
appellees
suggest
that
since
the
enactment
of
nepa,
the
commission
should
always
suspend
new
rates
until
an
environmental
impact
statement
has
been
prepared
and
filed
but
as
the
second
circuit
had
pointed
out,
sometimes
suspension
has
environmental
implications.
if,
for
example,
the
railroad
should
be
so
impaired
that
they
have
to
abandon
some
of
their
service,
the
very
things
that
the
appellees
are
concerned
about
might
come
into
operation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
think
that
they
were
required
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
to
hold,
well,
perhaps
not.
perhaps,
i
think
that
was
helpful
that
is
one
way
that
they
can
make
nepa
not
applicable.
the
other
way
is
by
saying
that
nepa
should
not
be
construed
in
any
event
because
of
the
--
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
language,
to
apply
the
suspension
orders
which
under
the
statute
must
be
made
within
30
days.
i
think,
i
would
say,
there
were
two
alternative
grounds
upon
which
the
commission
could
refrain
from
making
a
full
environmental
impact
statement.
mr.
cox
will
now
deal
with
further
questions
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
procedures
of
the
commission.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
court,
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
suit
was
brought
there
to
set
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
it
involves
questions
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
other
interrelated
questions.
i
am
representing
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
mr.
cox
is
representing
the
appellant
railroads
in
number
72-562.
we
have
filed
separate
briefs,
but
there
is
no
diversions
between
our
positions.
the
setting
of
the
stage
for
this
case
began
in
december
1971,
when
the
nation's
railroads
requested
special
permission
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
authorize
on
short
notice,
a
two-and-a-half
percent
surcharge
on
nearly
all
freight
rates
across
the
board.
they
asked
that
this
be
affective
on
january
1,
1972.
the
commission
disallowed
this
request
on
the
ground
that
there
was
inadequate
notice,
but
it
allowed
the
carriers
to
refile
the
proposal
to
be
affective
on
not
less
than
30
days
notice,
and
the
carriers
did
refile
on
january
5,
1972
asking
that
the
two-and-half-percent
surcharge
become
affective
on
february
5.
under
section
3
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
a
rate
proposed
by
a
carrier
becomes
affective
unless
the
commission
suspends
it
within
30
days.
and
this
suspension
pending
on
investigation
under
section
15(7)
is
effective
for
a
maximum
period
of
seven
months
after
which
the
carrier
may
put
the
rate
into
affect
unless
the
commission
prior
to
that
date
has
completed
its
investigation
and
affirmatively
found
that
the
proposed
rate
is
unlawful.
in
this
case,
during
the
30-day
period
protests
were
filed
by
shippers
and
other
interested
parties
and
environmental
groups,
including
the
named
appellee
here,
scrap
opposed
the
surcharge
on
the
ground
that
the
prevailing
rates
structure
discourages
the
movement
of
recyclable
goods
and
that
an
across-the-board
surcharge
would
further
discourage
recycling.
the
commission
found
that
the
railroads
had
a
critical
need
for
additional
revenue
and
concluded
that
the
proposed
surcharge
should
not
be
suspended.
it
ordered
the
carriers,
however,
to
publish
permanent
increased
rates
no
later
than
june
5,
1972
and
provided
that
the
authority
to
collect
the
two-and-half
percent
surcharge
would
expire
on
that
date.
the
commission
also
specifically
found
that
the
temporary
surcharge
would
appear
to
have
no
significant
adverse
effect
on
the
environment
within
the
meaning
of
the
environmental
policy
act
and
there
was
evidence
before
the
commission
to
support
that
finding.
the
carriers
then
filed
proposed
selective
increases
averaging
4.1%
and
protests
were
filed.
on
april
24,
1972,
the
commission
instituted
an
investigation
into
the
lawfulness
of
the
selective
increases
and
suspended
them
for
the
statutory
seven
month
period
under
section
15(7).
at
the
same
time
it
authorized
the
railroads
to
continue
to
collect
the
two-and-half
percent
surcharge
until
the
end
of
the
suspension
period
which
was
november
30,
1972.
a
few
days
later
on
may
12,
1972
this
suit
was
files
by
scrap
and
on
june
1st,
the
environmental
defense
fund
and
other
environmental
groups
intervened
as
plaintiffs.
various
defenses
to
the
suit
were
advanced,
but
these
were
rejected
by
the
district
court
and
on
july
10,
1972
that
court
added
an
injunction
by
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
restrained
from
permitting
the
railroads
to
collect
the
surcharge
and
the
railroads
are
enjoined
from
collecting
it
insofar
as
it
relates
to
goods
being
transported
for
purposes
of
recycling.
as
a
result,
surcharge
is
now
being
collected
on
recyclable
materials.
i
have
stated
the
basic
facts
without
bringing
in
the
legal
issues.
these
are
numerous
and
somewhat
intertwined.
questions
relating
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
procedures
of
the
commission
will
be
presented
by
mr.
cox.
i
would
like
to
repeat
though
that
there
is
no
difference
between
our
positions
either
in
substance
or
approach
and
i
want
to
claim
the
benefit
of
any
argument
that
he
will
make.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
first
issue
in
the
case
to
which
i
will
turn
is
the
familiar
question
of
standing.
we
have
a
rather
remarkable
situation
here.
five
law
school
students
though
i
am
told
they
are
changing
groups,
some
of
them
have
graduated
and
some
others
have
taken
their
places,
but
i
understand
there
are
still
five,
proceeding
not
as
lawyers,
but
as
plaintiffs
though
not
as
tax
payers,
have
tied
up
all
the
railroads
in
the
country
and
with
aid
of
the
district
court
have
prevented
the
railroads
from
collecting
from
$500,000
to
$1,000,000
a
month
for
the
past
eight
months
on
shipments
of
recyclable
materials.
they
have
been
joined
by
several
environmental
groups,
but
the
latter
make
no
different
allegations
and
the
case
may
be
treated
on
the
basis
of
the
position
relied
on
by
scrap.
just
last
thursday,
the
district
court
did
grant
a
motion
to
intervene
by
the
associate
--
national
association
of
secondary
industries,
inc,
which
is
an
organization
which
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
in
this
court,
the
light
green
a
brief
amicus
curiae.
now,
the
order
wasn't
filed
with
the
clerk
until
friday
and
we
didn't
hear
about
it
until
monday.
i
don't
think
that
has
any
relation
to
the
case
which
is
pending
before
the
court
on
appeal
and
in
any
event
insofar
as
these
people
are
shippers,
they
would
appear
to
be
clearly
are
not
entitled
to
the
equitable
relief
which
is
the
only
thing
involved
here.
after
all,
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
granting
of
a
preliminary
injunction
because
they
would
have
a
plain
and
adequate
remedy
at
law
by
way
of
review
of
the
rate
order
of
the
commission.
the
allegations
of
scrap
appear
at
pages
8
to
10
of
the
appendix,
particularly
on
page,
the
bottom
half
of
page
9.
they
allege
that
each
member
of
scrap,
although
we
have
now
some
new
members
who
apparently
have
not
formally
joined
in
this
petition,
each
member
of
scrap
has
been
caused
to
pay
more
for
finished
products
purchased
in
the
marketplace,
made
more
expensive
by
both
non-use
of
recycle
materials
on
their
manufacture
and
the
need
to
use
comparatively
more
energy
and
the
reduction
of
a
raw
material
to
finished
the
products
and
two
uses,
the
forests,
rivers,
streams,
mountains
and
other
natural
resources
surrounding
the
washington
metropolitan
area
and
at
his
legal
residence
for
camping,
hiking,
fishing,
site-seeing
and
other
recreational
or
aesthetic
purposes
and
passing
to
the
third
has
been
and
continue
to
be
exposed
to
the
quality
of
the
air
within
the
washington
metropolitan
area
and
their
legal
residence.
now,
it
will
be
seen
that
these
allegations
are
entirely
general.
it
is
not
said,
which
forests,
rivers,
streams
or
mountain?
we
don't
even
have
a
particular
valley
as
we
did
in
the
mineral
king
case
last
year.
which
forest,
stream,
river
or
mountain
is
used
by
any
members
scrap,
it
is
obvious
that
these
allegations
could
be
made
by
any
member
of
the
public,
who
wishes
to
make.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
not
only
didn't
take
testimony,
but
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
their
standing
and
the
position
of
scrap
in
their
motion
that
dismiss
is
that
such
evidence
was
unnecessary.
district
court
didn't
require
any
proof,
even
of
these
allegations
and
quoting
from
their
motion
to
affirm,
scrap
said
that
proof
of
its
injuries
is
unnecessary
for
purpose
of
standing
and
it
also
said
that
it
was
a
and
i
am
quoting
that
it
was
obvious,
that
is
their
word,
that
scrap
could
not
and
i
quote,
“prove
the
amount
of
additional
pollution
in
the
washington
d.c.
area
created
by
the
latest
icc
railroad
rate
increase.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
shippers
whose
rates
were
increased
would
have
standing.
i
am
not
sure
that
anyone
would
have
standing
to
obtain
an
injunction
in
this
case.
that
is
a
question
which
interrelates
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
argument
that
mr.
cox
is
going
to
make.
there
are
those
who
feel
that
standing
is
no
longer
a
relevant
argument,
though
i
wonder
if
our
predecessors
were
always
that
wrong.
in
another
case,
judge
gisele
in
this
district,
nearly
two
years
ago
said,
in
recent
years,
the
supreme
court
has
greatly
expanded
the
concept
of
standing
and
in
this
circuit,
the
concept
has
now
been
almost
completely
abandoned
and
similarly
in
a
recent
article
in
the
cincinnati
law
review,
the
author
concludes
with
this
statement,
“the
law
would
be
so
much
better
if
the
courts
got
directly
on
with
the
task
of
deciding
the
merits
of
the
claims
presented
without
passing
on
the
merits
of
the
plaintiff
presenting
them.”
now,
there
is
a
certain
simple
appeal
in
that
and
it
may
represent
the
wave
of
the
future,
but
it
is
a
serious
step,
the
implications
of
which
should
be
carefully
explored
and
considered.
before
going
further,
i
may
observe
that
if
there
is
standing
in
this
case,
it
would
be
helpful,
i
think
and
a
contribution
to
candor,
if
this
court
would
indicate
that
standing
is
no
longer
required,
for
to
say
that
standing
is
required
and
that
there
is
standing
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
so,
mr.
justice.
the
united
states
has
standing
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
a
state
–
a
state
might
well
have
the
standing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
there
are
many
situations
under
which
the
united
states
would
have
standing
to
enforce
matters
relating
to
environmental
protection,
particularly
in
view
of
the
statute
which
congress
has
enacted
stating
the
policy
of
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
person
who
had
business
interest
would
have
standing,
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
limited
to
a
dollar
amount
as
in
sierra
club
against
morton.
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart
it
was
recognized
that
aesthetic
interests
could
affect
it.
as,
for
example,
a
person
who
owns
a
piece
of
land
and
in
violation
of
an
environmental
statute,
his
view
is
going
to
be
obstructed,
even
though
it
might
not
have
a
--
it
just
happened
to
be
a
sentimental
view
that
he
had
reason
to
like,
but
it
affects
him.
it
isn't
something
that
deals
with
the
public
in
general.
standing
is
not
a
fiction
and
never
has
been
and
should
not
be.
if
anyone
has
standing
to
bring
a
suit
like
this,
it
will
mark
a
substantial
shift
in
the
balance
under
our
traditional
and
constitutional
separation
of
powers
where
this
is
what
the
constitution
meant
by
cases
or
controversies,
to
which
the
judicial
power
is
extended.
if
everyone
is
a
private
attorney
general,
free
to
raise
any
public
question
at
his
whim
or
because
of
his
academic
or
abstract
interest,
more
and
more
questions
will
be
thrown
into
the
courts
and
we
can
readily
have
a
situation
where
every
facet
of
our
governmental
operation
depends
on
the
later
hindrance
of
the
courts
wherein
affect
the
courts
would
take
over
all
the
details
of
the
administration
of
the
government.
in
my
view,
that
would
not
be
good
for
the
courts
and
it
would
not
be
good
for
the
country.
perhaps,
more
pertinent,
it
is
not
the
the
sort
of
division
of
function
which
was
intended
by
the
framers
as
i
see
it,
when
they
established
the
constitution.
i
don't
want
to
argue
another
case,
but
this
court
last
monday
granted
certiorari
in
united
states
against
richardson,
which
is
a
clear
illustration
of
the
type
of
question
which
will
arise
if
there
is
standing
in
a
case
like
this.
it
may
seem
very
fine
to
some
today
to
have
the
courts
decide
all
the
legal
questions,
often
pretty
much
in
advance
and
in
the
absence
of
concrete
facts
as
is
the
situation
here.
for
the
courts
today
are
progressive
and
forward
looking
and
innovative,
but
it
has
not
always
been
so.
there
have
been
times
when
the
courts
were
felt
by
way
and
be
backward
looking
and
obstructive
and
serious
attacks
on
the
courts
have
occurred.
of
course,
the
court
should
do
their
duty.
they
should
exercise
a
judicial
power
without
fear
or
favor,
but
the
judicial
power
does
not
authorize
a
general
overriding
sort
of
oversight
of
all
legal
questions
arising
in
the
government,
a
sort
of
ombudsman
to
whom
all
may
resort
when
they
feel
so
impelled.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
judicial
power
was
extended
to
cases
of
controversies
and
that
should
mean
bona
fide
disputes
by
a
party
who
has
a
real
stake
and
who
can
show
how
he
has
been
hurt.
that
is
not
this
case
with
respect
to
any
of
the
appellees.
i
turn
now
to
one
of
the
substantive
questions
in
this
case,
namely
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
its
application
to
the
action
of
the
icc
which
has
been
enjoined
here.
we
start
with
the
procedure
long
established
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
as
indicated
in
the
previous
case
and
as
i
have
said,
the
commission
is
given
broad
power
to
suspend,
propose
rates
but
it
has
only
30
days
within
which
to
take
this
action
and
under
section
15(7),
it
has
only
seven
months
after
suspension
to
act
on
the
proposed
rates.
if
the
commission
has
not
acted
within
seven
months,
the
new
rates
go
into
effect.
on
january
1,
1970,
the
president
signed
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
this
is
obviously
a
statute
to
great
importance.
establishing
a
clearly
stated
public
policy
and
it
is
obviously
to
be
taken
seriously
by
all
agencies
of
the
government.
it
was
enacted
in
sweeping,
but
rather
general
terms.
the
act
established
a
council
on
environmental
quality
with
explicit
duties
in
the
areas
of
research
and
investigation
into
environmental
quality
and
the
council
has
issued
guidelines
under
the
act,
which
are
set
out
at
pages
43
to
54
of
our
brief,
but
the
council
has
no
administrative
responsibilities.
it
decides
no
cases
and
issues
no
orders
to
agencies
or
parties
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
judicial
review
of
any
action
or
non-action.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
can't
be
judicial
review.
i
am
merely
observing
that
the
statute
though
sweeping,
is
not
particularly
articulated,
is
cast
in
very
general
terms
and
obviously
requires
some
construing.
when
we
look
at
the
environment
statute
itself,
section
102
c,
1022
c,
which
is
on
page
42
of
our
brief,
we
find
that
it
applies
to
legislative
proposals
which
are
not
involved
here
and
then
the
keywords
are
major
federal
action.
if
major
federal
actions,
if
they
are
ones
“significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.”
thus,
we
have
at
the
threshold
two
phrases
which
require
the
consideration
of
this
court.
there
is
another
phrase
at
the
beginning
of
section
102
that
i
will
mention
later
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
and
it
seems
to
me
in
large
measures
this
part
of
this
case
turns
on
the
construction
which
this
court
gives
to
those
three
phrases.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
limits
these
phrases
to
any
particular
agencies
or
types
of
agencies.
for
example,
literally,
the
statutes
applies
to
decisions
of
this
court
and
if
so,
after
all
this
court
is
a
federal
agency
and
if
this
court
takes
an
action,
it
then
well
be
a
major
federal
action,
if
so
construed,
would
require
the
court
to
issue
an
environmental
impact
statement
after
consulting
all
interested
federal
agencies
before
making
any
decision
which
could
the
affect
the
environment
and
under
the
regulations
of
the
council
on
environmental
quality,
this
process
could
take
at
least
four
months
and
probably
a
good
year
longer.
as
i
have
said,
what
this
court
does
is
often
major
federal
action
and
what
it
does
may
affect
the
environment.
for
example,
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
or
in
last
term,
sierra
club
case
or
in
a
case
involving
school
busing,
might
as
least
arguably
has
a
significant
environmental
affect.
now,
i
hasten
to
make
it
plain
that
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
apply
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
i
do
suggest
that
reaching
that
result
takes
some
construing.
in
the
light
of
the
whole
setting,
it
is
right
and
sound,
i
think
that
to
conclude
that
by
the
words,
major
federal
actions
in
the
statute,
congress
did
not
mean
to
include
decisions
of
this
court.
though
there
is
no
definition
of
a
federal
agency
or
anything
like
that
which
excludes
this
court,
even
though,
they
are
obviously
federal
action
and
may
often
be
major.
if
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
such
a
limitations
and
i
think
it
is
and
must
be,
then
it
becomes
necessary
to
consider
the
statute
in
its
application
in
other
set
of
things.
our
submission
is
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
the
national
environmental
policy
act
was
not
intended
to
displace
the
interstate
commerce
act
when
the
application
of
nepa
is
not
feasible
in
the
light
of
the
scheme
for
prompt
action
established
by
the
commerce
act.
now,
this
result
requires
no
straining
of
the
statutory
language.
for
section
102
itself
starts
out
with
the
provision
that
the
policies
of
nepa
are
to
be
applied
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
where
as
a
practical
matter,
the
application
of
the
nepa
procedures
is
not
possible
because
of
the
time
limitations
and
the
operative
statutes,
nepa
should
not
be
construed
to
require.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
to
suspension
orders,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
as
to
the
--.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
as
to
their
final
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
may
will
develop
the
materials
which,
as
a
part
of
their
final
action,
will
include
an
appropriate
environmental
protection
statement.
the
commission
does
not
take
the
position
that
nepa
is
never
applicable
to
the
commission,
but
only
that
it
is
not
applicable
to
suspension
orders
which
must
be
acted
on
within
30
days.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
they
do
or
do
not,
they
must
do
one
or
the
other
within
30
days.
if
the
commission
doesn't
act
within
30
days,
the
new
rate
goes
into
effect.
if
section
1022
(c)
is
applicable,
it
requires
the
preparation
of
an
elaborate
environmental
impact
statement,
the
elaboration
of
which
is
apparent
from
the
material
in
the
statute
on
page
43
of
our
brief
which
i
won't
take
time
to
read,
but
which
shows
that
it
is
a
very
large
indication
--
undertaking.
the
guidelines
issued
by
the
council
which
were
suggested
in
the
committee
reports
of
both
houses
of
congress
is
not
something
that
the
council
made
overly
elaborate.
the
guidelines
indicate
that
environmental
impact
statement
should
be
issued
in
two
stages.
first,
a
draft
should
be
prepared
by
the
agency
involved,
then
it
is
provided
in
the
statute
it
should
be
reviewed
by
other
agencies,
federal,
state
and
local
which
have
special
interest
or
expertise.
the
council
suggests
that
90
days
be
allowed
fro
this
process.
the
draft
is
also
available
to
citizens
for
comments.
the
agency
then
prepares
a
final
statement
in
the
light
of
all
the
comments
that
it
receives.
it
then
issues
a
statement
and
makes
it
available
to
the
council
on
environmental
quality
and
the
public.
it
is
not
to
take
any
administrative
action
for
30
days
thereafter
in
making
the
statement,
it
is
further
enjoined
by
the
statute
in
very
comprehensive
terms
which
appear
at
the
bottom
of
page
33
and
top
of
page
34
of
our
brief.
it
is
required
to
utilize
a
systematic
interdisciplinary
approach
which
will
ensure
that
integrated
use
of
the
natural
and
social
sciences
and
the
environmental
design
arts
in
planning
and
decision
making,
which
may
have
an
impact
on
man's
environment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
–
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
environmental
fine
arts
is
not
defined.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
applies
to
anything
to
which
it
applies,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
in
very
broad
and
sweeping
area.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
argument,
no
doubt,
will
be
made
under
this
statute
that
at
some
point.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
no,
mr.
justice.
that
is
the
position
of
the
commission
that
that
is
what
they
did.
actually,
what
they
did
was
to
say,
we
will
not
suspend
it,
but
you
must,
within
a
fixed
time,
propose
permanent
rates
and
we
will
then
terminate
the
suspension
when
your
permanent
upgrades
going
to
affect.
so,
it
was
a
conditional
non-suspension.
it
wasn't
simply
we
don't
suspend
which
would
have
put
the
two-and-a-half
percent
increase
into
effect.
the
commission
has,
it
has
to
consider
suspension
orders
in
approximately
4000
cases
a
year.
the
commission
was
obviously
confronted
with
the
task
of
determining
its
duty
in
the
light
of
the
two
statutes
taken
together.
by
its
own
terms,
nepa
is
applicable
only
to
actions
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment
and
in
this
case,
the
commission
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
proposed
across
the
board
temporary
surcharge,
“will
have
no
significant
adverse
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.”
the
court
below
said
that
this
finding
appears
to
be
no
more
than
glorified
border
play.
perhaps,
it
did
not
adequately
recognized
the
commission's
experience
in
the
field,
nor
its
standing
as
a
co-ordinating
agency
of
the
government
seeking
to
comply
with
its
duty
under
provision
to
two
statutes
which
are
surely
not
wholly
clear
in
their
interrelations.
now,
it
is
obvious
that
nepa
can't
be
complied
with
fully
within
30
days.
the
appellees
suggest
that
since
the
enactment
of
nepa,
the
commission
should
always
suspend
new
rates
until
an
environmental
impact
statement
has
been
prepared
and
filed
but
as
the
second
circuit
had
pointed
out,
sometimes
suspension
has
environmental
implications.
if,
for
example,
the
railroad
should
be
so
impaired
that
they
have
to
abandon
some
of
their
service,
the
very
things
that
the
appellees
are
concerned
about
might
come
into
operation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
think
that
they
were
required
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
to
hold,
well,
perhaps
not.
perhaps,
i
think
that
was
helpful
that
is
one
way
that
they
can
make
nepa
not
applicable.
the
other
way
is
by
saying
that
nepa
should
not
be
construed
in
any
event
because
of
the
--
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
language,
to
apply
the
suspension
orders
which
under
the
statute
must
be
made
within
30
days.
i
think,
i
would
say,
there
were
two
alternative
grounds
upon
which
the
commission
could
refrain
from
making
a
full
environmental
impact
statement.
mr.
cox
will
now
deal
with
further
questions
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
procedures
of
the
commission.
