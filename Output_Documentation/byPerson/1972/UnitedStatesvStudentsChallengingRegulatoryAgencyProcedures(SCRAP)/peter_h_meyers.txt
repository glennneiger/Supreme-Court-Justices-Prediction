mr.
peter
h.
meyers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
every
year
this
nation
produces
more
than
four
billion
tons
of
solid
refuse.
only
a
very
small
fraction
of
this
scrap
was
recycled
even
though
most
of
it
is
capable
of
being
recycled
and
reused.
railroad
freight
rates
which
are
authorized
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
a
major
factor
discouraging
recycling.
this
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
i
will
address
myself
primarily
to
the
issue
of
the
commission's
failure
to
comply
with
the
national
environmental
policy
act
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
prior
to
april
24th
audit.
mr.
dienelt
will
address
the
other
issues
in
this
case.
on
january
1st
1970,
the
date
nepa
became
effective,
a
national
policy
was
established
to
protect
the
environment.
all
agencies
were
required
in
the
strongest
language
to
consider
environmental
values
in
their
decision-making
procedures.
in
section
101
(b)
(6)
of
the
act,
congress
specifically
focused
on
the
recycling
problem
and
declared
that
it
was
the
responsibility
of
all
federal
agencies
to
“enhance
the
quality
of
renewable
resources
and
approach
the
maximum
attainable
recycling
of
depletable
resources.”
in
the
three
years
that
nepa
has
been
in
effect,
the
commission
has
failed
totally
to
fulfill
this
duty
to
encourage
recycling
and
has
refused
to
implement
the
procedural
obligations
of
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
the
act
requiring
a
preparation
of
environmental
impact
statements.
the
commission
has
granted
three
general
rate
increases
on
a
recyclable
materials
since
1970,
this
case
is
the
third,
without
ever
making
a
detailed
assessment
of
their
environmental
impact,
without
attempting
to
accommodate
its
procedures
to
the
requirements
of
nepa
and
without
proposing
any
legislative
measures
to
the
president
pursuant
to
section
103
of
the
act
to
bring
the
commission's
procedure
into
conformity
with
nepa,
if
there
were
any
contrasts.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
case
where
both
the
counsel
on
environmental
quality
and
the
environmental
protection
agency
have
more
strongly
protested
an
agency's
implementation
of
nepa.
these
letters
to
the
commission
in
this
and
prior
proceedings
are
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
and
are
on
appendix
before
this
court.
it
is
scrap's
position
that
compliance
with
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
nepa
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
required
the
commission
to
prepare
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement
prior
to
its
april
24th
suspension
order
in
this
case.
we
do
not
necessarily
seek
and
the
district
court
specifically
refused
to
hold
more
generally
that
a
draft
impact
statement
is
always
required
before
the
commission
makes
its
suspension
decisions.
the
district
court's
language
to
this
affect
is
quoted
on
page
20
of
our
brief.
section
102
(2(
(c)
of
the
act
requires
the
preparation
of
a
detailed
environmental
impact
statement,
prior
to
agency
action,
involving
as
the
solicitor
pointed
out,
a
major
federal
action
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
copies
of
the
statement
quoting
the
language
of
section
102
and
i
quote
again,
“shall
accompany
the
proposal
through
the
existing
agency
review
process.”
the
clear
objective
of
the
impact
statement
requirement
is
to
build
into
the
decision
making
process
a
careful
and
thorough
assessment
of
the
potential
environmental
dangers
of
and
alternatives
to
agency
action
and
to
assist
the
agencies
in
implementing
the
policies
declared
in
section
101
of
the
act
specifically,
including
the
duty
to
encourage
recycling.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
it's
scrap's
position
your
honor
that
it
does
not
matter
what
action
the
commission
takes.
whether
it
suspends
or
not
suspends,
the
important
factor
in
this
case
is
that
when
the
commission
is
going
to
--
can
make
that
decision
when
it
is
considering
whether
or
not
to
allow
increased
rates
on
recyclable
commodities
to
go
into
effect,
it
is
required
to
know
what
affect
those
rate
increases
will
have.
whether
it
takes
either
specific
action
is
not
crucial.
the
section
in
language
102
which
requires
compliance
with
102
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
has
been
held
by
a
number
of
courts
which
are
quoted
in
our
brief
to
impose
a
high
standard.
it
does
not
create
as
the
court
in
calvert
cliffs
pointed
out
and
the
“escape
hatch
for
footdragging
agencies.”
the
impact
statement
must
be
prepared
as
early
as
possible
and
in
all
cases
prior
to
agency
decision
which
may
have
a
significant
affect
upon
the
environment,
even
interim
agency
decisions.
the
cases
to
this
affect
and
the
council
on
environmental
quality
guidelines
to
this
affect
are
quoted
at
pages
15
through
16
of
our
brief.
the
solicitor
as
well
as
the
railroads
places
great
stress
on
the
commission's
february
one
finding
of
no
environmental
impact.
i
would
like
to
address
this
point
for
a
few
minutes.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
below
correctly
held
that
this
unsupported
finding
which
was
severally
criticized
by
both
the
council
on
environmental
quality
and
environmental
protection
agency
was
no
more
than
glorified
(voice
overlap).
it
ignored
section
5
(b)
of
the
ceq
guidelines.
the
section
5
(b)
of
the
ceq
guidelines
requires
the
agencies
to
prepare
an
impact
statement
whenever
they
are
is
“potential”
that
the
environment
maybe
significantly
affected
or
if
the
impact
is
and
“likely
to
be
highly
controversial.”
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief
that
the
ceq
guidelines
are
entitled
to
great
weight,
we
agree
with
that
position.
in
any
event,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
incorporated
the
ceq
guidelines
into
its
own
rules
and
would
be
bound
by
them
in
this
proceeding.
another
reason
why
the
february
1st
finding
cannot
adequately
support
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
is
that
on
february
1st,
the
commission
was
considering
whether
or
not
to
suspend
temporary
2.5%
surcharge.
we
did
not
go
into
the
court
after
the
february
1st
suspension
decision.
we
waited
until
the
commission
had
made
a
suspension
decision
on
the
4.1%
permanent
selective
increases.
we
are
unable
to
see
how
a
finding
with
respect
to
a
2.5%
temporary
surcharge
could
be
held
to
support
the
commission's
decision
on
april
24th
when
it
was
considering
larger
permanent
increases.
finally
on
march
6th
the
commission
issued
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement.
the
scope
of
this
statement
is
somewhat
unclear.
at
portions
of
the
impact
statement
the
commission
says
that
for
purposes
of
considering
the
impact
they
will
evaluate
the
permanent
increases.
in
other
portions
of
the
statement.
the
commission
says
it
is
considering
the
surcharge
as
if
it
was
a
permanent
part
of
the
rate
structure.
in
this
draft
impact
statement,
which
is
set
up
also
in
the
appendix,
the
commission
frankly
acknowledged
that
it
did
not
know
what
affect
even
the
surcharge
would
have,
if
made
a
permanent
part
of
the
rate
structure.
if
this
is
true,
how
could
the
commission
know
what
effect
the
larger
permanent
increases
might
have
upon
the
environment
and
how
can
they
continue
to
rely
on
this
february
1st
finding,
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
proceeding
where
they
made
their
boilerplate
determination
that
there
was
no
potential
impact.
the
crucial
issue
in
this
case,
as
the
railroads
and
the
solicitor
have
argued
it,
is
whether
it
is
impossible
for
the
commission
to
comply
with
nepa
and
with
the
ceq
guidelines
within
the
30-day
period
it
has
for
determining
whether
or
not
to
suspend
a
rate.
i,
before
answering
this,
i
would
like
to
reinforce
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
did
not
hold
and
we
are
not
seeking
an
absolute
rule
that
the
commission
must
always
prepare
its
draft
impact
statement
before
its
suspension
decisions,
but
we
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
maybe
quite
possible
for
the
commission
to
prepare
impact
statements
in
future
general
rate
increase
proceedings
on
recyclable
commodities.
once
it
has
finally
prepared
the
draft
environmental
impact
statement
in
this
proceeding.
secondly,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
this
30-day
period
is
not
an
inflexible
period.
the
commission
can
and
has
extended
this
30-day
period
to
several
months
in
order
to
give
the
public,
greater
notice
of
the
purposed
increases.
the
government's
reply
brief
at
page
4
quotes
a
portion
of
section
63
interstate
commerce
act.
reading
that
whole
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
becomes
apparent
and
it
has
been
consistently
construed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
whenever
the
railroads
request
special
permission
to
depart
from
normal
tariff
filing
requirements,
the
commission
can
require
the
railroad
to
provide
the
public
with
whatever
amount
of
times
notice
the
commission
thinks
is
appropriate.
now
the
solicitor's
brief
points
out,
it
should
--
it
points
--
makes
the
argument,
pardon
me,
makes
the
argument
that
whether
or
not
the
commission
should
file
an
impact
statement
should
not
depend
upon
the
fortuitous
circumstance
of
whether
the
railroads
request
special
permission.
it
is
my
understanding,
however,
that
railroads
tariffs
with
the
last
30
years
and
into
the
foreseeable
future
are
always
so
complicated
that
the
railroads
are
as
a
practical
matter
always
require
to
seek
special
permission
in
these
general
rate
increase
cases
and
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
commission
will
always
have
the
opportunity
to
extend
this
30-day
period.
more
important,
however,
is
the
fact
that
the
commission
should
have
begun
its
environmental
assessment
when
nepa
went
into
affect
three
years
ago.
it
should
not
have
waited
until
the
railroads
came
to
them
with
their
purposed
increases.
it
will
always
be
in
the
commission's
language,
impossible
for
the
commission
to
comply,
if
it
does
nothing.
it
will
have
its
first
30-day
suspension
period,
in
its
own
language
and
then
it
will
issue
its
final
order
and
it
will
be
impossible
to
comply
in
that
proceeding
and
then
the
second
time
the
railroads
come
for
their
rate
increases,
it
will
impossible
to
comply
at
the
suspension
stage
and
by
the
final
order
and
this
key
go
on
forever.
also
the
council
on
environmental
quality
specifically
informed
the
interstate
commerce
commission
below
that
it
should
file
an
adequate
draft
impact
statement
prior
to
its
first
suspension
decision
on
february
1st
and
inform
them
again
prior
to
its
second
suspension
decision
on
april
24th.
it
is
also
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
that
is
not
a
necessary
conclusion
of
our
argument.
it
should
have
suspended
at
least
until
it
is
found
out
what
the
impact
was.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
yeah.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
we
do
not
make
it
--
we
do
not
take
that
position
in
necessarily
every
case.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
in
this
case,
we
do.
there
has
to
come
an
end
to
the
time
where
the
commission
can
continue
to
grant
these
incremental
increases,
which
the
council
on
environmental
quality
and
environmental
protection
seek
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
i
would
like
to
make
two
specific
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
in
section
102
(1)
of
the
ct,
congress
specifically
requires
the
commission
to
adjust
its
procedures
to
permit
it
to
comply
with
nepa
and
in
section
103
of
the
act,
congress
says,
if
there
is
any
conflict
which
does
not
permit
you
to
comply
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
go
to
the
president
for
post
changes.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
no,
it
is
my
understanding,
it
is
not
there
in
variable
practices.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
right,
that
is
correct.
that
is
my
understanding
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
in
addition,
the
commission
in
neither
of
the
suspension
orders
involved
in
this
case,
did
the
commission
rely
upon
this
impossibility
argument.
commission
did
not
say
it
was
not
possible
to
comply
with
nepa.
the
commission
has
in
effect
left
it
to
its
counsel
to
make
this
argument
to
this
court
now
more
than
three
years
after
nepa
has
been
into
effect
that
it
is
impossible
to
comply.
the
commission,
however,
has
not
gone
to
the
president
to
propose
changes,
has
not
attempted
to
adjust
its
procedures
to
the
requirements
of
the
act.
the
commission
has
done
virtually
nothing.
the
commission
has
--
this
is
the
third
general
rate
increase
proceeding
after
(inaudible)
effect,
and
the
commission
says,
because
they
have
done
nothing
previously,
we
can
not
comply
now.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
triggered
the
need
when
the
railroads
proposed
increases
on
the
recyclable
commodities,
which
could
have
a
significant
environmental
effect.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
no,
the
increases
went
to
all
rates.
the
recycling
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
i
cannot
see
how
inspection
charges
for
grains
could
even
remotely
have
an
environmental
impact
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
nepa
went
into
effect
in
1970
placed
up
on
a
commission
in
section
101
(b)
(6)
a
specific
duty
to
encourage
recycling.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
on
all
federal
agencies.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
i
would
not
go
that
far
your
honor
but
[laughter]
not
presented
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that
the
commission
is
obliged
to
follow
the
commands.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
no
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
it
is
the
words
of
section
102
(2)
(c).
the
impact
statement
is
required
only
for
major
federal
actions,
significantly
effecting
quality
of
the
environment.
now
the
commission
knows
if
there
should
not
be
any
doubt
that
the
railroads
for
example
will
be
requesting
another
rate
increase
in
the
next
year
or
two.
this
is
no
secret.
these
are
things
which
could
have
been
expected
and
should
have
been
foreseen
by
the
commission
when
nepa
went
into
effect.
we
review
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
nothing
in
it
specifically
dealing
with
the
interstate
commerce
act,
but
congress
i
believe
did
make
it
clear
that
no
agency
of
the
federal
government
can
and
i
am
quoting
from
portion
of
the
legislative
history
now,
the
major
changes
in
the
senate
can
under
its
statutory
authorizations
shall
utilize
an
excessively
narrow
construction
of
its
existing
statutory
authorizations.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
i
would
not
go
that
far,
your
honor.
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
nepa
in
requiring
environmental
impact
statement,
did
not
intend
this
requirement
to
be
type
of
hollow
ceremony
which
the
commission
apparently
believed
it
to
be
when
filed
its
draft
environmental
impact
statement
in
this
case.
congress
intended
that
the
agencies
to
undertake
a
detailed
assessment
of
the
environmental
impact
of
its
actions.
one
of
the
primary
reasons
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
commission
has
not
complied
with
nepa
and
has
not
even
attempted
to
integrate
nepa
into
its
own
procedures
is
that
it
has
refused
to
make
the
accommodations
in
its
own
procedural
requirements
which
would
make
nepa
meaningful.
it
has
continued
to
rely
upon
the
limited
self
serving
statements
which
the
parties
submit
to
it
in
these
general
rate
increase
proceedings.
it
has
continued
to
act
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
calvert
cliffs
as
an
umpire
sitting
back
and
evaluating
the
submissions
by
the
parties.
we
submit
that
the
courts,
that
this
court
should
follow
those
courts
which
have
said
that
nepa
requires
the
agency
to
take
this
initiative
in
considering
the
environmental
value
and
make
whatever
adjustments
in
resources
or
procedures
are
necessary
to
fully
comply
with
the
act.
thank
you.

peter
h.

it
please

a
major
factor
discouraging
recycling.
this
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
i
will
address
myself
primarily
to
the
issue
of
the
commission's
failure
to
comply
with
the
national
environmental
policy
act
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
prior
to
april
24th
audit.
mr.
dienelt
will
address
the
other
issues
in
this
case.
on
january
1st
1970,
the
date
nepa
became
effective,
a
national
policy
was
established
to
protect
the
environment.
all
agencies
were
required
in
the
strongest
language
to
consider
environmental
values
in
their
decision-making
procedures.
in
section
101
(b)
(6)
of
the
act,
congress
specifically
focused
on
the
recycling
problem
and
declared
that
it
was
the
responsibility
of
all
federal
agencies
to
“enhance
the
quality
of
renewable
resources
and
approach
the
maximum
attainable
recycling
of
depletable
resources.”
in
the
three
years
that
nepa
has
been
in
effect,
the
commission
has
failed
totally
to
fulfill
this
duty
to
encourage
recycling
and
has
refused
to
implement
the
procedural
obligations
of
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
the
act
requiring
a
preparation
of
environmental
impact
statements.
the
commission
has
granted
three
general
rate
increases
on
a
recyclable
materials
since
1970,
this
case
is
the
third,
without
ever
making
a
detailed
assessment
of
their
environmental
impact,
without
attempting
to
accommodate
its
procedures
to
the
requirements
of
nepa
and
without
proposing
any
legislative
measures
to
the
president
pursuant
to
section
103
of
the
act
to
bring
the
commission's
procedure
into
conformity
with
nepa,
if
there
were
any
contrasts.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
case
where
both
the
counsel
on
environmental
quality
and
the
environmental
protection
agency
have
more
strongly
protested
an
agency's
implementation
of
nepa.
these
letters
to
the
commission
in
this
and
prior
proceedings
are
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
and
are
on
appendix
before
this
court.
it
is
scrap's
position
that
compliance
with
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
nepa
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
required
the
commission
to
prepare
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement
prior
to
its
april
24th
suspension
order
in
this
case.
we
do
not
necessarily
seek
and
the
district
court
specifically
refused
to
hold
more
generally
that
a
draft
impact
statement
is
always
required
before
the
commission
makes
its
suspension
decisions.
the
district
court's
language
to
this
affect
is
quoted
on
page
20
of
our
brief.
section
102
(2(
(c)
of
the
act
requires
the
preparation
of
a
detailed
environmental
impact
statement,
prior
to
agency
action,
involving
as
the
solicitor
pointed
out,
a
major
federal
action
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
copies
of
the
statement
quoting
the
language
of
section
102
and
i
quote
again,
“shall
accompany
the
proposal
through
the
existing
agency
review
process.”
the
clear
objective
of
the
impact
statement
requirement
is
to
build
into
the
decision
making
process
a
careful
and
thorough
assessment
of
the
potential
environmental
dangers
of
and
alternatives
to
agency
action
and
to
assist
the
agencies
in
implementing
the
policies
declared
in
section
101
of
the
act
specifically,
including
the
duty
to
encourage
recycling.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
it's
scrap's
position
your
honor
that
it
does
not
matter
what
action
the
commission
takes.
whether
it
suspends
or
not
suspends,
the
important
factor
in
this
case
is
that
when
the
commission
is
going
to
--
can
make
that
decision
when
it
is
considering
whether
or
not
to
allow
increased
rates
on
recyclable
commodities
to
go
into
effect,
it
is
required
to
know
what
affect
those
rate
increases
will
have.
whether
it
takes
either
specific
action
is
not
crucial.
the
section
in
language
102
which
requires
compliance
with
102
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
has
been
held
by
a
number
of
courts
which
are
quoted
in
our
brief
to
impose
a
high
standard.
it
does
not
create
as
the
court
in
calvert
cliffs
pointed
out
and
the
“escape
hatch
for
footdragging
agencies.”
the
impact
statement
must
be
prepared
as
early
as
possible
and
in
all
cases
prior
to
agency
decision
which
may
have
a
significant
affect
upon
the
environment,
even
interim
agency
decisions.
the
cases
to
this
affect
and
the
council
on
environmental
quality
guidelines
to
this
affect
are
quoted
at
pages
15
through
16
of
our
brief.
the
solicitor
as
well
as
the
railroads
places
great
stress
on
the
commission's
february
one
finding
of
no
environmental
impact.
i
would
like
to
address
this
point
for
a
few
minutes.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
below
correctly
held
that
this
unsupported
finding
which
was
severally
criticized
by
both
the
council
on
environmental
quality
and
environmental
protection
agency
was
no
more
than
glorified
(voice
overlap).
it
ignored
section
5
(b)
of
the
ceq
guidelines.
the
section
5
(b)
of
the
ceq
guidelines
requires
the
agencies
to
prepare
an
impact
statement
whenever
they
are
is
“potential”
that
the
environment
maybe
significantly
affected
or
if
the
impact
is
and
“likely
to
be
highly
controversial.”
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief
that
the
ceq
guidelines
are
entitled
to
great
weight,
we
agree
with
that
position.
in
any
event,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
incorporated
the
ceq
guidelines
into
its
own
rules
and
would
be
bound
by
them
in
this
proceeding.
another
reason
why
the
february
1st
finding
cannot
adequately
support
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
is
that
on
february
1st,
the
commission
was
considering
whether
or
not
to
suspend
temporary
2.5%
surcharge.
we
did
not
go
into
the
court
after
the
february
1st
suspension
decision.
we
waited
until
the
commission
had
made
a
suspension
decision
on
the
4.1%
permanent
selective
increases.
we
are
unable
to
see
how
a
finding
with
respect
to
a
2.5%
temporary
surcharge
could
be
held
to
support
the
commission's
decision
on
april
24th
when
it
was
considering
larger
permanent
increases.
finally
on
march
6th
the
commission
issued
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement.
the
scope
of
this
statement
is
somewhat
unclear.
at
portions
of
the
impact
statement
the
commission
says
that
for
purposes
of
considering
the
impact
they
will
evaluate
the
permanent
increases.
in
other
portions
of
the
statement.
the
commission
says
it
is
considering
the
surcharge
as
if
it
was
a
permanent
part
of
the
rate
structure.
in
this
draft
impact
statement,
which
is
set
up
also
in
the
appendix,
the
commission
frankly
acknowledged
that
it
did
not
know
what
affect
even
the
surcharge
would
have,
if
made
a
permanent
part
of
the
rate
structure.
if
this
is
true,
how
could
the
commission
know
what
effect
the
larger
permanent
increases
might
have
upon
the
environment
and
how
can
they
continue
to
rely
on
this
february
1st
finding,
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
proceeding
where
they
made
their
boilerplate
determination
that
there
was
no
potential
impact.
the
crucial
issue
in
this
case,
as
the
railroads
and
the
solicitor
have
argued
it,
is
whether
it
is
impossible
for
the
commission
to
comply
with
nepa
and
with
the
ceq
guidelines
within
the
30-day
period
it
has
for
determining
whether
or
not
to
suspend
a
rate.
i,
before
answering
this,
i
would
like
to
reinforce
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
did
not
hold
and
we
are
not
seeking
an
absolute
rule
that
the
commission
must
always
prepare
its
draft
impact
statement
before
its
suspension
decisions,
but
we
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
maybe
quite
possible
for
the
commission
to
prepare
impact
statements
in
future
general
rate
increase
proceedings
on
recyclable
commodities.
once
it
has
finally
prepared
the
draft
environmental
impact
statement
in
this
proceeding.
secondly,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
this
30-day
period
is
not
an
inflexible
period.
the
commission
can
and
has
extended
this
30-day
period
to
several
months
in
order
to
give
the
public,
greater
notice
of
the
purposed
increases.
the
government's
reply
brief
at
page
4
quotes
a
portion
of
section
63
interstate
commerce
act.
reading
that
whole
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
becomes
apparent
and
it
has
been
consistently
construed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
whenever
the
railroads
request
special
permission
to
depart
from
normal
tariff
filing
requirements,
the
commission
can
require
the
railroad
to
provide
the
public
with
whatever
amount
of
times
notice
the
commission
thinks
is
appropriate.
now
the
solicitor's
brief
points
out,
it
should
--
it
points
--
makes
the
argument,
pardon
me,
makes
the
argument
that
whether
or
not
the
commission
should
file
an
impact
statement
should
not
depend
upon
the
fortuitous
circumstance
of
whether
the
railroads
request
special
permission.
it
is
my
understanding,
however,
that
railroads
tariffs
with
the
last
30
years
and
into
the
foreseeable
future
are
always
so
complicated
that
the
railroads
are
as
a
practical
matter
always
require
to
seek
special
permission
in
these
general
rate
increase
cases
and
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
commission
will
always
have
the
opportunity
to
extend
this
30-day
period.
more
important,
however,
is
the
fact
that
the
commission
should
have
begun
its
environmental
assessment
when
nepa
went
into
affect
three
years
ago.
it
should
not
have
waited
until
the
railroads
came
to
them
with
their
purposed
increases.
it
will
always
be
in
the
commission's
language,
impossible
for
the
commission
to
comply,
if
it
does
nothing.
it
will
have
its
first
30-day
suspension
period,
in
its
own
language
and
then
it
will
issue
its
final
order
and
it
will
be
impossible
to
comply
in
that
proceeding
and
then
the
second
time
the
railroads
come
for
their
rate
increases,
it
will
impossible
to
comply
at
the
suspension
stage
and
by
the
final
order
and
this
key
go
on
forever.
also
the
council
on
environmental
quality
specifically
informed
the
interstate
commerce
commission
below
that
it
should
file
an
adequate
draft
impact
statement
prior
to
its
first
suspension
decision
on
february
1st
and
inform
them
again
prior
to
its
second
suspension
decision
on
april
24th.
it
is
also
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
that
is
not
a
necessary
conclusion
of
our
argument.
it
should
have
suspended
at
least
until
it
is
found
out
what
the
impact
was.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
yeah.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
we
do
not
make
it
--
we
do
not
take
that
position
in
necessarily
every
case.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
in
this
case,
we
do.
there
has
to
come
an
end
to
the
time
where
the
commission
can
continue
to
grant
these
incremental
increases,
which
the
council
on
environmental
quality
and
environmental
protection
seek
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
i
would
like
to
make
two
specific
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
in
section
102
(1)
of
the
ct,
congress
specifically
requires
the
commission
to
adjust
its
procedures
to
permit
it
to
comply
with
nepa
and
in
section
103
of
the
act,
congress
says,
if
there
is
any
conflict
which
does
not
permit
you
to
comply
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
go
to
the
president
for
post
changes.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
no,
it
is
my
understanding,
it
is
not
there
in
variable
practices.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
right,
that
is
correct.
that
is
my
understanding
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
in
addition,
the
commission
in
neither
of
the
suspension
orders
involved
in
this
case,
did
the
commission
rely
upon
this
impossibility
argument.
commission
did
not
say
it
was
not
possible
to
comply
with
nepa.
the
commission
has
in
effect
left
it
to
its
counsel
to
make
this
argument
to
this
court
now
more
than
three
years
after
nepa
has
been
into
effect
that
it
is
impossible
to
comply.
the
commission,
however,
has
not
gone
to
the
president
to
propose
changes,
has
not
attempted
to
adjust
its
procedures
to
the
requirements
of
the
act.
the
commission
has
done
virtually
nothing.
the
commission
has
--
this
is
the
third
general
rate
increase
proceeding
after
(inaudible)
effect,
and
the
commission
says,
because
they
have
done
nothing
previously,
we
can
not
comply
now.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
triggered
the
need
when
the
railroads
proposed
increases
on
the
recyclable
commodities,
which
could
have
a
significant
environmental
effect.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
no,
the
increases
went
to
all
rates.
the
recycling
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
i
cannot
see
how
inspection
charges
for
grains
could
even
remotely
have
an
environmental
impact
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
nepa
went
into
effect
in
1970
placed
up
on
a
commission
in
section
101
(b)
(6)
a
specific
duty
to
encourage
recycling.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
on
all
federal
agencies.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
i
would
not
go
that
far
your
honor
but
[laughter]
not
presented
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that
the
commission
is
obliged
to
follow
the
commands.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
no
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
it
is
the
words
of
section
102
(2)
(c).
the
impact
statement
is
required
only
for
major
federal
actions,
significantly
effecting
quality
of
the
environment.
now
the
commission
knows
if
there
should
not
be
any
doubt
that
the
railroads
for
example
will
be
requesting
another
rate
increase
in
the
next
year
or
two.
this
is
no
secret.
these
are
things
which
could
have
been
expected
and
should
have
been
foreseen
by
the
commission
when
nepa
went
into
effect.
we
review
--
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
nothing
in
it
specifically
dealing
with
the
interstate
commerce
act,
but
congress
i
believe
did
make
it
clear
that
no
agency
of
the
federal
government
can
and
i
am
quoting
from
portion
of
the
legislative
history
now,
the
major
changes
in
the
senate
can
under
its
statutory
authorizations
shall
utilize
an
excessively
narrow
construction
of
its
existing
statutory
authorizations.
mr.
peter
h.
meyers
i
would
not
go
that
far,
your
honor.
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
nepa
in
requiring
environmental
impact
statement,
did
not
intend
this
requirement
to
be
type
of
hollow
ceremony
which
the
commission
apparently
believed
it
to
be
when
filed
its
draft
environmental
impact
statement
in
this
case.
congress
intended
that
the
agencies
to
undertake
a
detailed
assessment
of
the
environmental
impact
of
its
actions.
one
of
the
primary
reasons
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
commission
has
not
complied
with
nepa
and
has
not
even
attempted
to
integrate
nepa
into
its
own
procedures
is
that
it
has
refused
to
make
the
accommodations
in
its
own
procedural
requirements
which
would
make
nepa
meaningful.
it
has
continued
to
rely
upon
the
limited
self
serving
statements
which
the
parties
submit
to
it
in
these
general
rate
increase
proceedings.
it
has
continued
to
act
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
calvert
cliffs
as
an
umpire
sitting
back
and
evaluating
the
submissions
by
the
parties.
we
submit
that
the
courts,
that
this
court
should
follow
those
courts
which
have
said
that
nepa
requires
the
agency
to
take
this
initiative
in
considering
the
environmental
value
and
make
whatever
adjustments
in
resources
or
procedures
are
necessary
to
fully
comply
with
the
act.
thank
you.
