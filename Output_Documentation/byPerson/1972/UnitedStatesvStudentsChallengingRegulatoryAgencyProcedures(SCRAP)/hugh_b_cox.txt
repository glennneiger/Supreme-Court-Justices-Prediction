mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
the
time,
i
may
have
to
limit
my
argument
to
a
single
point
which
is
directed
to
the
nature
of
the
injunctive
relief
that
was
granted
below.
that
injunction
as
it
has
been
said,
enjoined
to
commission
from
permitting
the
interim
rate
increase
and
railroads
from
collecting
it
now,
it
is
my
submission
that
even
if
it
is
assumed
that
plaintiffs
have
standing,
that
nepa
applies,
that
commission
did
not
comply
with
nepa,
even
on
those
assumptions
that
injunctive
relief
was
erroneous.
now,
of
course,
we
do
not
accept
those
assumptions,
they
are
disputed
in
our
brief.
there
is
one
additional
assumption
which
is
of
great
importance
and
that
is
that
these
orders,
refusing
to
suspend
rates
are
reviewable
at
all.
if
i
have
any
time,
i
shall
try
to
sat
something
about
that
otherwise,
i
shall
have
to
submit
it
on
the
briefs.
but
for
the
present,
i
am
making
these
assumptions
and
our
point
is
that
on
those
assumptions,
the
court
would
have
been
entitled
to
set
aside
these
orders
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
with
directions
to
the
commission
to
comply
with
the
court's
statement
of
the
law
and
the
commission
would
have
been
oblige
to
do
so,
but
the
court
did
not
have
authority
to
suspend
the
rates
itself
or
compel
the
commission
to
suspend
them
or
to
enjoin
the
railroads
from
collecting
it.
now,
this
is
a
point
of
great
practical
importance
to
the
rail
transportation
system
of
this
country.
this
injunction
as
has
been
said
has
caused
and
will
continue
to
cause
substantial
revenue
loss
for
the
railroads
and
particularly
to
the
railroads
in
the
north-eastern
part
of
the
united
states
who
are
disabled
to
stand.
but
beyond
those
immediate
consequences
it
has
general
consequences
which
are
far
more
serious,
because
it
is
an
assertion
of
power
on
the
part
of
a
district
court
to
enjoin
rates
when
the
commission
is
declined
to
do
so
in
any
case
involved
in
environmental
issue
to
enjoin
the
railroads
from
collecting
the
rates
although
the
rates
have
never
been
determined
to
the
be
unlawful
and
what
is
more
to
do
these
things
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
seven
months
limitation
on
suspension
orders
that
is
specifically
described
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
if
you
take
it
from
the
time
that
the
commission
itself
could
have
suspended
the
rates
i
think
that
time
expired
in,
i
think,
on
5th
of
september.
if
you
take
it
from
the
time
that
the
district
court,
and
i
wouldn't
think
this
is
proper,
but
if
you
take
from
the
time
the
district
court
enjoined
the
rates,
they
have
been
enjoin
suspended
more
than
seven
months
because
that
period
expired
about
the
15th
of
this
month,
so
anyway
you
look
at
it,
whatever,
however
you
do
treat
the
dates,
these
rates
have
been
suspended
as
a
result
of
the
district
court's
injunction
for
more
than
seven
months
and
there
was
no
limitation
in
the
injunction
at
all.
now,
this
point
is
--
the
practical
importance
of
this
situation
lies
in
fact
that
the
most
--
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
constant
problems
that
the
railroads
of
this
country
have
had
for
25
years
is
the
lag,
this
time
lag
that
exist
between
the
time
when
they
must
pay
increased
costs
and
time
when
they
can
partially
offset
those
costs
by
increasing
the
rates.
now,
some
time
lag
is
inevitable.
the
railroads
have
to
endure
it
because
it
is
imposed
upon
them
by
the
interstate
commerce.
they
have
to
give
30
days
notice
unless
the
commission
released
them
from
it.
the
commission
can
suspend
the
rates
for
seven
months
and
that
loss
is
irreparable.
the
railroads
can't
do
anything
about
it,
but
the
railroads
are
gravely
disturbed
by
any
judicial
alteration
of
the
regulatory
plan
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
increases
that
delay
and
increases
the
time
lag
and
i
think
some
figures
about
this
present
proceeding
are
pertinent
here.
in
19
–
at
the
end
of
1971
when
the
railroads
initiated
this,
tried
to
initiate
this
rate
increase,
at
that
time
and
since
the
last
time
they
had
raised
their
rates
generally,
their
costs
had
increased
by
one
billion
dollars.
most
of
that
cost
is
in
labor
cost
and
payroll
taxes
on
wages.
in
the
time
which
this
very
proceeding
has
been
pending
today,
those
costs
have
been
increased
by
another
billion
dollars.
now,
if
the
railroads
had
been
able,
which
they
were
not,
to
lay
their
hands
on
the
revenue,
the
entire
revenue
that
they
hoped
to
obtain
from
the
rate
increase,
the
general
rate
increase
that
is
involved
which
was
about
350
million
dollars,
if
they
had
been
able
to
raise
–
lay
their
hands
on
that
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
proceeding,
it
would
have
been
only
a
partial
offset
about
25%
of
these
increased
costs.
i
think
against
that
background
the
court
can
understand
why
is
this
situation
is
a
concern
to
the
railroads
and
is
a
concern
to
the
rail
transportation
system
of
this
country.
because
the
railroads
need
this
revenue,
they
need
it
to
provide
the
services
which
improve
their
services
and
maintain
their
services
to
prevent
diversion
of
traffic
to
truck,
which
the
appellees
says
himself
and
have
environmental
consequences.
they
needed
matter
of
fact
to
put
their
own
environmental
projects
on
which
they
spend
a
great
deal
of
money.
the
conclusion,
the
practical
situation
that
is
created
by
this
assertion
of
judicial
authority,
i
point
out
to
the
court
is
a
serious
one
because
it
is
not
--
its
limited,
you
can
say
its
limited
to
cases
involving
environmental
issues,
but
that
limitation
does
reduce
its
practical
significance
because
of
arguments
that
the
appellees
here
show,
the
arguments
they
made
before
the
commission
a
claim
of
environmental
affects
can
be
based
on
any
adjustment
in
rail
rates
on
the
ground
that
it
diverts
traffic
to
trucks
and
even
these
recycle
commodities
involve
a
great
range
of
commodities
and
they
are
commodities
that
involved
in
litigation
not
only
in
these
general
rate
increase
cases
but
involved
limited
and
specific
cases.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that's
precisely
the
point.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
there
is
one
like
it
is,
i
think
very
similar
--
there
is
one
just
difference
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
injunction
or
this
was
interposed
at
the
very
suspension
stage
of
the
proceeding
before
to
commission.
the
rates
and
of
course
the
commission
there
had
exercised
the
suspension
policy
and
then
the
railroads
had
voluntarily
extended
and
here
this
the
railroad
commission
having
refuse
to
suspend
them,
the
court
stepped
in
and
in
effect
suspended
them.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think,
they
are
,
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
it's
before
it's
ever
considered
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
and
no
one
here
suggested
that
these
rates
are
unlawful,
even
the
court
below
didn't
do
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
would
say
that
if
you
give
those
terms
their
broadest
meaning
mr.
justice
white
that
nepa
would
require
them
determining,
at
least
i
would
be
fair
to
say
that
nepa
would
require
the
commission
in
considering
and
determining
just
and
reasonableness
as
to
take
into
account
environmental
factors,
as
it
did
sometimes
before
the
passing
to
nepa.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
you
include
in
that
all
the
various
discrimination
as
usually
is
and
non-competitive
rates
and
kind
of
thing.
that's
its
statutory
mandate.
now
what
nepa
has
supposed
to
have
done
is
to
add
some
additional
factors
to
that
just
as
declaration
of
the
transportation
policy,
the
other
is
the
old
hoch-smith
resolution
did
back
of
1920.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
as
in
the
case
of
anti
trust
practice,
which
i
think
was
more
often
done
by
the
courts
and
by
congress,
but
it's
there
just
the
same.
now
these
consequences
are
consequences
a
man
might
accept
if
you
were
forced
to
them
by
some
explicit
core
line
of
judicial
decisions
or
legislative
command,
you
could
hardly
embrace
them
even
in
those
circumstances.
but
my
submission
is
that
this
assertion
of
power
by
the
district
court
was
not
--
cannot
be
justified
by
any
statute
or
by
any
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
but
is
in
fact
inconsistent
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
with
this
court's
decision
in
arrow
and
while
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
my
time
has
expired,
but
--
no,
i
have
a
little
more
time.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
there
is
absolutely
no
indication,
either
in
the
words
of
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history
that
it
intended,
statute
was
intended
to
amend
the
interstate
commerce
act,
to
change
the
regulatory
plan
or
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
our
appellees,
the
appellees,
one
of
them
here
says,
oddly
enough
in
support
of
its
argument
that
congress
did
not
specifically
deal
with
this
matter
or
to
use
the
appellee's
words
even
paused
to
consider
it.
it
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
argument
to
make
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
perhaps
a
reasonable
speculation.
i
couldn't
say,
but
i
do
say
to
the
court
that
on
this
very
point
that
their
ultimate
reliance
in
this
case
is
on
the
nepa
argument,
because
while
they
some
precedents
and
concepts
from
existing
law,
when
you
examine
those
other
cases
they
cite
in
the
concepts,
they
aren't
applicable
here
and
of
course
one
on
which
they
principally
rely
i
think
was
dealt
with
in
that
footnote
22
on
page
671
of
the
arrow
opinion,
so
that
their
ultimate
reliance
on
this
injunctive,
extraordinary
injunctive
relief
is
simply
that
nepa
changed
the
law.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh!
i
think
i
should
have
to
say
mr.
justice
at
least
in
this
proceeding,
i
think
they've
taken
the
position
that
they
would
prefer
not
to
have
the
rates
increased
or
they
would
like
to
see
the
rates
suspended
in
files.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
may
have
not
filed
anything
in
this
court
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
dean
has
or
i
beg
pardon
your
pardon,
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
the
argument
on
that
point
and
we
hardly
concur
on
it.
we
i
think
we
take
the
position
that
at
the
suspension
stage
because
of
the
time
involved
in
the
nature
of
the
decision,
no
environmental
statement
and
indeed
no
finding
of
no
environmental
impact
is
required.
that
can
be
dealt
with
a
next
stage
of
the
right
proceeding.
alternatively,
we
say
that
if
anything
was
required,
the
finding
was
required
and
the
finding
was
made
here
and
it
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
i
would
like
to
--
if
i
have
any
time
left
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
to
speak
very
briefly
on
this
question
of
reviewability,
which
is
someways
ancillary
to
the
point
i
have
made
although
independent.
now
here
again,
the
appellees
rely
really
on
nepa
because
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
in
the
unbroken
line
really
of
cases
holding
that
order
that
does
nothing
except
refuse
to
suspend
rates
is
not
reviewable
at
all.
there
is
a
suggestion
by
judge
friendly
in
one
case
that
an
order
of
suspending
rate,
maybe
reviewable,
if
it
is
made
or
vitiated
by
an
absolute
lack
of
power
as,
for
example,
that
the
commission
tried
to
suspend
to
more
than
seven
months.
but
refusals
to
suspend
have
been
held
generally
not
be
reviewable,
i
think,
because
of
the
considerations
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
in
the
arrow
case,
because
of
its
relationship
to
the
injunction
point
that
i've
argued.
and
here
again,
appellees
ultimately
rely
on
the
assertion
that
nepa
has
changed
the
law
and
has
made
orders
reviewable
that
were
not
reviewable
before
and
here
again
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
legislative
history
on
the
act
to
suggest
the
statute
was
ever
intended
to
have
that
consequence.
now
i
emphasize
in
concluding
that
my
argument
on
reviewability
is
independent
of
the
argument
on
the
nature
of
the
injunctive
relief
and
i
am
where
i
began
by
saying
to
this
court
that
if
you
assume
everything
else,
the
court
below
here
went
far
beyond
any
legitimate
function
it
has
as
reviewing
court
would
have
done
--
to
suspend
these
rates
and
to
enjoin
the
railroads
from
collecting
rates
that
have
never
been
determined
to
be
unlawful.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
the
time,
i
may
have
to
limit
my
argument
to
a
single
point
which
is
directed
to
the
nature
of
the
injunctive
relief
that
was
granted
below.
that
injunction
as
it
has
been
said,
enjoined
to
commission
from
permitting
the
interim
rate
increase
and
railroads
from
collecting
it
now,
it
is
my
submission
that
even
if
it
is
assumed
that
plaintiffs
have
standing,
that
nepa
applies,
that
commission
did
not
comply
with
nepa,
even
on
those
assumptions
that
injunctive
relief
was
erroneous.
now,
of
course,
we
do
not
accept
those
assumptions,
they
are
disputed
in
our
brief.
there
is
one
additional
assumption
which
is
of
great
importance
and
that
is
that
these
orders,
refusing
to
suspend
rates
are
reviewable
at
all.
if
i
have
any
time,
i
shall
try
to
sat
something
about
that
otherwise,
i
shall
have
to
submit
it
on
the
briefs.
but
for
the
present,
i
am
making
these
assumptions
and
our
point
is
that
on
those
assumptions,
the
court
would
have
been
entitled
to
set
aside
these
orders
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
with
directions
to
the
commission
to
comply
with
the
court's
statement
of
the
law
and
the
commission
would
have
been
oblige
to
do
so,
but
the
court
did
not
have
authority
to
suspend
the
rates
itself
or
compel
the
commission
to
suspend
them
or
to
enjoin
the
railroads
from
collecting
it.
now,
this
is
a
point
of
great
practical
importance
to
the
rail
transportation
system
of
this
country.
this
injunction
as
has
been
said
has
caused
and
will
continue
to
cause
substantial
revenue
loss
for
the
railroads
and
particularly
to
the
railroads
in
the
north-eastern
part
of
the
united
states
who
are
disabled
to
stand.
but
beyond
those
immediate
consequences
it
has
general
consequences
which
are
far
more
serious,
because
it
is
an
assertion
of
power
on
the
part
of
a
district
court
to
enjoin
rates
when
the
commission
is
declined
to
do
so
in
any
case
involved
in
environmental
issue
to
enjoin
the
railroads
from
collecting
the
rates
although
the
rates
have
never
been
determined
to
the
be
unlawful
and
what
is
more
to
do
these
things
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
seven
months
limitation
on
suspension
orders
that
is
specifically
described
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
if
you
take
it
from
the
time
that
the
commission
itself
could
have
suspended
the
rates
i
think
that
time
expired
in,
i
think,
on
5th
of
september.
if
you
take
it
from
the
time
that
the
district
court,
and
i
wouldn't
think
this
is
proper,
but
if
you
take
from
the
time
the
district
court
enjoined
the
rates,
they
have
been
enjoin
suspended
more
than
seven
months
because
that
period
expired
about
the
15th
of
this
month,
so
anyway
you
look
at
it,
whatever,
however
you
do
treat
the
dates,
these
rates
have
been
suspended
as
a
result
of
the
district
court's
injunction
for
more
than
seven
months
and
there
was
no
limitation
in
the
injunction
at
all.
now,
this
point
is
--
the
practical
importance
of
this
situation
lies
in
fact
that
the
most
--
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
constant
problems
that
the
railroads
of
this
country
have
had
for
25
years
is
the
lag,
this
time
lag
that
exist
between
the
time
when
they
must
pay
increased
costs
and
time
when
they
can
partially
offset
those
costs
by
increasing
the
rates.
now,
some
time
lag
is
inevitable.
the
railroads
have
to
endure
it
because
it
is
imposed
upon
them
by
the
interstate
commerce.
they
have
to
give
30
days
notice
unless
the
commission
released
them
from
it.
the
commission
can
suspend
the
rates
for
seven
months
and
that
loss
is
irreparable.
the
railroads
can't
do
anything
about
it,
but
the
railroads
are
gravely
disturbed
by
any
judicial
alteration
of
the
regulatory
plan
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
increases
that
delay
and
increases
the
time
lag
and
i
think
some
figures
about
this
present
proceeding
are
pertinent
here.
in
19
–
at
the
end
of
1971
when
the
railroads
initiated
this,
tried
to
initiate
this
rate
increase,
at
that
time
and
since
the
last
time
they
had
raised
their
rates
generally,
their
costs
had
increased
by
one
billion
dollars.
most
of
that
cost
is
in
labor
cost
and
payroll
taxes
on
wages.
in
the
time
which
this
very
proceeding
has
been
pending
today,
those
costs
have
been
increased
by
another
billion
dollars.
now,
if
the
railroads
had
been
able,
which
they
were
not,
to
lay
their
hands
on
the
revenue,
the
entire
revenue
that
they
hoped
to
obtain
from
the
rate
increase,
the
general
rate
increase
that
is
involved
which
was
about
350
million
dollars,
if
they
had
been
able
to
raise
–
lay
their
hands
on
that
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
proceeding,
it
would
have
been
only
a
partial
offset
about
25%
of
these
increased
costs.
i
think
against
that
background
the
court
can
understand
why
is
this
situation
is
a
concern
to
the
railroads
and
is
a
concern
to
the
rail
transportation
system
of
this
country.
because
the
railroads
need
this
revenue,
they
need
it
to
provide
the
services
which
improve
their
services
and
maintain
their
services
to
prevent
diversion
of
traffic
to
truck,
which
the
appellees
says
himself
and
have
environmental
consequences.
they
needed
matter
of
fact
to
put
their
own
environmental
projects
on
which
they
spend
a
great
deal
of
money.
the
conclusion,
the
practical
situation
that
is
created
by
this
assertion
of
judicial
authority,
i
point
out
to
the
court
is
a
serious
one
because
it
is
not
--
its
limited,
you
can
say
its
limited
to
cases
involving
environmental
issues,
but
that
limitation
does
reduce
its
practical
significance
because
of
arguments
that
the
appellees
here
show,
the
arguments
they
made
before
the
commission
a
claim
of
environmental
affects
can
be
based
on
any
adjustment
in
rail
rates
on
the
ground
that
it
diverts
traffic
to
trucks
and
even
these
recycle
commodities
involve
a
great
range
of
commodities
and
they
are
commodities
that
involved
in
litigation
not
only
in
these
general
rate
increase
cases
but
involved
limited
and
specific
cases.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that's
precisely
the
point.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
there
is
one
like
it
is,
i
think
very
similar
--
there
is
one
just
difference
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
injunction
or
this
was
interposed
at
the
very
suspension
stage
of
the
proceeding
before
to
commission.
the
rates
and
of
course
the
commission
there
had
exercised
the
suspension
policy
and
then
the
railroads
had
voluntarily
extended
and
here
this
the
railroad
commission
having
refuse
to
suspend
them,
the
court
stepped
in
and
in
effect
suspended
them.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think,
they
are
,
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
it's
before
it's
ever
considered
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
and
no
one
here
suggested
that
these
rates
are
unlawful,
even
the
court
below
didn't
do
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
would
say
that
if
you
give
those
terms
their
broadest
meaning
mr.
justice
white
that
nepa
would
require
them
determining,
at
least
i
would
be
fair
to
say
that
nepa
would
require
the
commission
in
considering
and
determining
just
and
reasonableness
as
to
take
into
account
environmental
factors,
as
it
did
sometimes
before
the
passing
to
nepa.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
you
include
in
that
all
the
various
discrimination
as
usually
is
and
non-competitive
rates
and
kind
of
thing.
that's
its
statutory
mandate.
now
what
nepa
has
supposed
to
have
done
is
to
add
some
additional
factors
to
that
just
as
declaration
of
the
transportation
policy,
the
other
is
the
old
hoch-smith
resolution
did
back
of
1920.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
as
in
the
case
of
anti
trust
practice,
which
i
think
was
more
often
done
by
the
courts
and
by
congress,
but
it's
there
just
the
same.
now
these
consequences
are
consequences
a
man
might
accept
if
you
were
forced
to
them
by
some
explicit
core
line
of
judicial
decisions
or
legislative
command,
you
could
hardly
embrace
them
even
in
those
circumstances.
but
my
submission
is
that
this
assertion
of
power
by
the
district
court
was
not
--
cannot
be
justified
by
any
statute
or
by
any
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
but
is
in
fact
inconsistent
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
with
this
court's
decision
in
arrow
and
while
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
my
time
has
expired,
but
--
no,
i
have
a
little
more
time.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
there
is
absolutely
no
indication,
either
in
the
words
of
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history
that
it
intended,
statute
was
intended
to
amend
the
interstate
commerce
act,
to
change
the
regulatory
plan
or
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
our
appellees,
the
appellees,
one
of
them
here
says,
oddly
enough
in
support
of
its
argument
that
congress
did
not
specifically
deal
with
this
matter
or
to
use
the
appellee's
words
even
paused
to
consider
it.
it
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
argument
to
make
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
perhaps
a
reasonable
speculation.
i
couldn't
say,
but
i
do
say
to
the
court
that
on
this
very
point
that
their
ultimate
reliance
in
this
case
is
on
the
nepa
argument,
because
while
they
some
precedents
and
concepts
from
existing
law,
when
you
examine
those
other
cases
they
cite
in
the
concepts,
they
aren't
applicable
here
and
of
course
one
on
which
they
principally
rely
i
think
was
dealt
with
in
that
footnote
22
on
page
671
of
the
arrow
opinion,
so
that
their
ultimate
reliance
on
this
injunctive,
extraordinary
injunctive
relief
is
simply
that
nepa
changed
the
law.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh!
i
think
i
should
have
to
say
mr.
justice
at
least
in
this
proceeding,
i
think
they've
taken
the
position
that
they
would
prefer
not
to
have
the
rates
increased
or
they
would
like
to
see
the
rates
suspended
in
files.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
may
have
not
filed
anything
in
this
court
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
dean
has
or
i
beg
pardon
your
pardon,
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
the
argument
on
that
point
and
we
hardly
concur
on
it.
we
i
think
we
take
the
position
that
at
the
suspension
stage
because
of
the
time
involved
in
the
nature
of
the
decision,
no
environmental
statement
and
indeed
no
finding
of
no
environmental
impact
is
required.
that
can
be
dealt
with
a
next
stage
of
the
right
proceeding.
alternatively,
we
say
that
if
anything
was
required,
the
finding
was
required
and
the
finding
was
made
here
and
it
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
i
would
like
to
--
if
i
have
any
time
left
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
to
speak
very
briefly
on
this
question
of
reviewability,
which
is
someways
ancillary
to
the
point
i
have
made
although
independent.
now
here
again,
the
appellees
rely
really
on
nepa
because
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
in
the
unbroken
line
really
of
cases
holding
that
order
that
does
nothing
except
refuse
to
suspend
rates
is
not
reviewable
at
all.
there
is
a
suggestion
by
judge
friendly
in
one
case
that
an
order
of
suspending
rate,
maybe
reviewable,
if
it
is
made
or
vitiated
by
an
absolute
lack
of
power
as,
for
example,
that
the
commission
tried
to
suspend
to
more
than
seven
months.
but
refusals
to
suspend
have
been
held
generally
not
be
reviewable,
i
think,
because
of
the
considerations
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
in
the
arrow
case,
because
of
its
relationship
to
the
injunction
point
that
i've
argued.
and
here
again,
appellees
ultimately
rely
on
the
assertion
that
nepa
has
changed
the
law
and
has
made
orders
reviewable
that
were
not
reviewable
before
and
here
again
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
legislative
history
on
the
act
to
suggest
the
statute
was
ever
intended
to
have
that
consequence.
now
i
emphasize
in
concluding
that
my
argument
on
reviewability
is
independent
of
the
argument
on
the
nature
of
the
injunctive
relief
and
i
am
where
i
began
by
saying
to
this
court
that
if
you
assume
everything
else,
the
court
below
here
went
far
beyond
any
legitimate
function
it
has
as
reviewing
court
would
have
done
--
to
suspend
these
rates
and
to
enjoin
the
railroads
from
collecting
rates
that
have
never
been
determined
to
be
unlawful.
