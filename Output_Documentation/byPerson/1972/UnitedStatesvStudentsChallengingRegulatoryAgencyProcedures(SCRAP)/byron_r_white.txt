justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
united
states
have
standing
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
united
states
have
standing
if
it
was
alleged
that
it's
moving
to
enforce
the
environmental
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
the
commission's
preferred
position
on
the
applicability
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
as
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
as
to
their
final
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
think
that
--
they
think
you
are
enforcing
the
investigation
and
the
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
take
the
same
position
whether
they
do
suspend
the
rates
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
you
are
arguing
that
affect
if
need
that
are
involved
here
shouldn't
make
any
difference
in
the
applicability
of
railroads?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
is
an
imposition
of
the
court
before
the
act
--
the
commission
is
even
before
to
take
final
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
possible
argument
that
then
there
is
that
the
deeper
in
such
factors
which
the
commission
should
consider
separately
and
apart
from
just
and
reasonable
or
would
it
be
as
part
of
that
concept?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
commission's
only
charter
is
to
determine
justness
and
reasonableness?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
in
the
case
of
anti
trust
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cox
is
there
any
indication
or
what
the
position
of
environmental
protection
agency
is?
is
it
in-charge
of
this
doing
and
enforcing
the
statute
as
if
an
agency
(inaudible)
courts,
is
nepa
or
it
the
agency,
do
they
have
any
difference
with
the
icc,
interstate
commerce
commission
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
haven't
filed
--
they
filed
a
separate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
maybe
one
thing,
but
what
about
the
procedure?
how
about
the
necessity
for
having
a
environmental
impact
statement
before
you
suspend
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
if
the
commission
cannot
its
job
get
done
with
respect
to
the
environmental
impact,
that
it
must
suspend
the
rates
until
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
you
do
not
take
the
position
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
you
are
taking
the
position
that
they
should
come
up
with
something
in
30
days
which
is
an
impossibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
the
commission's
practice
almost
invariably
is
to
suspend
the
rates
if
they
start
a
investigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
they
have
--
even
if
they
must
have
a
proceeding
to
investigate
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates,
they
do
not
necessarily
suspend
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
maybe
why
you
do
not
make
the
argument
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
agency
understand
(inaudible)
either
suspend
it
or
didn't
suspend
it
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
never,
unless
they
disagreed
that
it
was
satisfy
the
act
of
a
–
did
an
adequate
job
during
the
process
has
considering
whether
the
rate
is
just
and
reasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
and
that's
one
of
the
issues
here.
so
unless
the
agency
is
really
disagreed
with
the
commission's
position
in
this
respect
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
an
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
the
–
it
is
whether
the
content
of
an
impact
statement
submitted
by
the
commission
that
satisfies
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
just
here
because
the
commission
could
suspend
for
seven
months
and
do
its
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
environmental
protection
act
gives
them
that
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
–
you
said
they
work
them
into
30
days,
why
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
either
your
ask
for
we'll
suspend
for
seven
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
other
options
that
commission
has?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
commission
said
even
if
the
(inaudible)
filed,
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
general
regulations.
all
the
commission
could
was
suspend
it
for
seven
months
until
they
have
a
proceeding
and
make
the
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yeah,
but
that
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
any
citizen
in
case
of
higher
prices
challenge
the
consequence
of
a
price
board's
increase
--
order
authorizing
an
increase
in
meat
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
does
have
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
sierra
or
the
membership
is
irrelevant
for
almost
any
citizen?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
isn't
right
about
any
citizen,
if
that
isn't
correct
about
any
citizen,
it
isn't
correct
about
your
claims?
