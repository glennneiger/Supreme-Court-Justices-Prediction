j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
accept
for
nepa,
the
fact
situation
here
is
the
same
as
in
arrow
in
the
sense
that
there
had
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
that
sense
the
situations
are
comparable,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
expected
--
the
congress
even
addressed
the
question
of
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see
if
i
have
understand
you.
your
argument
is
that
to
comply
with
nepa's
mandate
that
the
commission
shall
adjust
its
procedures?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
within
the
30
day
period
it's
not
possible
to
comply
with
the
procedure
for
an
impact
statement,
then
the
duty
of
the
commission
is
to
use
the
option
open
to
it
of
suspend
it
for
seven
months.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
if
the
commission
can't
say,
we
can't
do
within
the
30
days
and
therefore
it's
impossible,
because
they
could
suspend
and
do
it
within
the
suspended
period,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
else
besides
suspending?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
the
assumption
that
it's
really
not
possible
within
30-day
time
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
might
say
about
your
argument
mr.
dienelt
is
what's
the
significance
of
30-day
limitation?
does
it
have
any
significance
in
connection
with
compliance
for
nepa?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
let's
take
the
situation
where
--
it
can't
be
done
within
30
days,
then
in
face
of
the
requirement
that
something
be
done
within
30
days,
what
is
open
to
the
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
all
of
this
had
--
one
or
the
other
of
those
things
must
be
done
within
30
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
do
you
–
area
you
saying
that
in
circumstances
where
no
other
way
of
doing
it,
is
available
to
commission,
the
commission
must
suspend
them
for
seven
months?
