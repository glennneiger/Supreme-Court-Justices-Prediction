mr.
john
f.
dienelt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
discussing
some
of
the
questions
which
have
been
raised
by
the
court
to
other
counsel
and
initially
to
reply
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
posed
to
mr.
cox,
regarding
the
relationship
between
nepa
and
this
court's
decision
in
arrow.
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
applying
nepa
is
a
very
different
decision,
a
very
different
set
of
facts
than
the
decision
involved
in
arrow.
arrow
involved
judicial
interference
with
rate
making.
arrow
involved
a
court
deciding
what
a
reasonable
rate
would
be,
issuing
an
injunction
on
that
basis.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
kind
of
exercise
of
discretion
which
we
acknowledge
is
committed
to
an
agency.
this
case
deals
with
clear,
unambiguous
procedures
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
imposes
upon
all
federal
agencies
not
including
the
courts
who
are
not
agencies
under
the
apa
and
whom
we
submit
are
not
agencies
under
nepa.
the
significance
of
the
difference
between
the
arrow
set
of
facts
and
the
set
of
facts
in
this
case
is
that
in
arrow,
it
could
be
said
that
a
court
was
interfering
with
the
congressional
decision
to
commit
discretion
to
the
agency.
here,
what
the
court
is
doing
is
enforcing
on
what
is
perhaps
the
most
recalcitrant
agency
among
federal
agencies
with
respect
to
nepa
the
clear
congressional
requirements.
it
is
working
to
enforce
congressional
requirements,
it
is
not
working
against
the
discretion
of
an
agency
which
congress
has
committed
to
that
agency.
what
the
court
did
was
see
that
the
commission
from
the
beginning
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
on
january
1,
1970
had
done
nothing
to
attempt
to
accommodate
its
practices
to
the
requirements
of
nepa.
the
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
as
early
as
october
1970,
the
council
on
environmental
quality
which
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
is
the
agency
which
we
could
say
would
have
the
responsibility
to
interpret
nepa,
had
told
the
commission,
it's
your
job
to
begun
to
comply
with
nepa.
it's
particularly
your
job
to
apply
its
procedures
in
order
to
fulfill
the
explicit
policy,
that
congress
set
forth
in
nepa.
the
clearest
policy,
the
clearest
substantive
policy
that
congress
set
was
to
enhance
the
quality
of
renewable
resources
and
approach
the
maximum
attainable
recycling
of
depletable
resources.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
don't
believe
that
the
agency
has
said
either
way
on
that
question.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that
was
we
submit
the
issue
before
the
district
court.
the
ceq
didn't
say
one
way
or
another.
it
clearly
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
your
honor
we
don't
have
a
case
statement
in
this
record
from
the
agency
with
respect
to
the
general
question
of
whether
the
commission
is
obliged
with
respect
to
rate
increase
proposals
to
submit
an
impact
statement
in
a
30-day
period.
we
do
have
statements
from
the
ceq
criticizing
the
commission's
compliance
with
nepa
in
this
case
and
i
submit
there
is
a
very
good
reason
why
we
don't
have
a
statement
by
the
ceq.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
the
commission
is
obliged
to
file
an
impact
statement
in
a
every
rate
proceeding
in
a
30-day
period.
that's
not
what
the
district
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
the
issue
your
honor,
i
am
afraid
i
don't
understand
you,
the
district
court
held
that
the
commission
had
not
complied
with
nepa
in
this
case
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
it
didn't
say
exactly
what
procedure
the
commission
would
have
to
comply
with.
it
expressly
indicated
that
if
the
commission
made
a
good
faith
showing
of
compliance
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
that
it
would
be
inclined
not
to
impose
an
impact
statement
requirement
on
the
commission
or
to
indicate
that
its
order
had
violated
the
nepa.
the
commission
has
never
taken
the
position
until
it
arrived
in
court,
and
it
was
taken
by
its
lawyers
that
it's
an
impossibility
for
to
comply
with
the
act
in
a
30-day
period.
the
30-day
period
is
something
of
a
false
issue,
mr.
justice
white
because
rate
decisions
are
not
made,
at
least
general
rate
increase
proceedings
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
are
not
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
one
thing
the
commission
could
do
your
honor
and
other
thing
that
commission
to
do
was,
as
it
has
in
the
most
recent
general
rate
increase
proceedings,
tell
the
railroads
that
they
don't
have
special
permission
to
file
a
rate
within
a
short
period
of
time,
that
they
have
to
give
the
public
75
days
notice
or
90
days
notice
or
whatever
period
of
time
is
appropriate.
and
in
that
time
the
commission
can
comply
with
the
act
of
the
fullest
extent
possible,
and
that
i
submit
is
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
gives
the
commission,
not
the
power,
not
really
with
the
power,
but
the
duty
to
comply
with
the
act
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
no
your
honor
it
doesn't.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
in
case
where
an
environmental
impact
is
asserted,
it
may
well
be
that
one
doesn't
exist
and
in
those
circumstances
a
commission
finding
of
no
significant
environmental
impact,
if
it's
based
on
a
record
and
if
its
adequately
explained
or
at
least
if
the
district
court
can
figure
out
what
the
commission
did
would
suffice
or
in
review.
in
some
circumstances
where
you
have
a
general
rate
increase
proceeding,
where
you
have
a
rate
increase
on
recyclable
materials,
whether
is
a
significant
environmental
impact,
then
we
submit
it
is
appropriate
to
throw
out
the
30-day
proceeding
because
nepa
requires
that.
but
we
want
to
stress
that
the
30-day
issue
is
somewhat
false,
because
more
time
is
permitted
to
the
commission
under
the
act
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
nepa's
requirements
as
interpreted
by
the
ceq
guidelines,
and
i'll
refer
you
to
the
section
10
of
the
guidelines
is
flexible
to
permit
an
agency
to
come
to
the
ceq
and
say
look
we
have
these
problems,
this
is
how
we
want
to
comply
with
the
act,
this
is
what
we
think
is
compliance
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
and
the
ceq
would
say
alright.
but
in
further
response
to
what
mr.
justice
white
was
asking,
“commission
never
went
to
the
ceq.”
the
ceq's
communications
with
the
commission
have
indicated
that
the
commission
has
to
comply
with
nepa,
it
has
to
begun
and
it
should
have
been
gone
on
january
1st
1970
to
consider
the
effects
of
its
permitting
rights
to
continue
to
go
into
the
effect
on
recyclable
materials
and
it
hasn't
done
that.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
our
argument
is
that's
one
possibility
that
the
commission
could
employ
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
act.
there
are
others
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
even
if
they
didn't
suspend
your
honor,
they
could
do
something.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
for
example
they
could
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
and
let's
take
the
assumption
that
30
days
is
what
their
limit
too
which
i
think
is
not
the
case,
but
within
the
30-day
period
they
could
submit
an
outline
of
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement.
they
could
take
their
general
experience
and
the
evidence
that
the
parties
submit,
and
the
evidence
that
their
own
staff
develops
which
they
didn't
do
in
this
case,
and
they
could
make
a
decision;
a
good
faith
decision
whether
or
not
there
was
a
significant
environmental
impact.
as
the
solicitor
general
earlier
argued,
if
that
decision
is
supportable,
then
they
don't
have
any
further
requirement.
if
it's
not
and
if
there
is
an
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
there
maybe
circumstances
where
for
example
the
railroads
propose
a
change
in
one
rate,
and
it
will
go
into
the
effect
in
30
days
and
in
that
period
if
environmental
impact
may
exist
and
it's
alleged,
we
submit
the
commission
should
consider
whether
there
is
a
significant
environmental
impact
from
say
that
one
rate
and
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
among
the
things
that
would
be
open
to
the
commission
would
be
to
file
a
draft
impact
statement,
to
file
an
outline
of
draft
impact
statement
to
indicate
how
it's
going
to
go
about
complying
with
nepa,
to
indicate
the
process
it's
going
to
follow,
to
make
a
decision
in
good
faith
that
there
is
no
significant
environmental
impact.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
within
in
the
time
period
that
the
commission
has.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
it
is
not,
your
honor
in
a
general
rating
increase
proceedings
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
because
the
railroads
when
they
come
in
with
a
request
raise
general
rates,
as
i
understand
it
as
now
as
a
practical
matter
you
have
to
come
in
with
what's
called
a
master
terrier
instead
of
coming
in
as
i
understand
it,
with
an
indication
of
what
the
rate
on
scrap
on
between
buick
and
omaha
is
and
for
every
other
rate
in
the
country
they
come
in
with
general
guides.
this
doesn't
comply
with
other
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
i
understand
it,
meaning
section
4
and
others.
so
they
have
to
ask
for
a
special
permission
as
a
practical
matter
whatever
the
detail
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
one
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
you'd
have
to
ask
for
a
special
permission
in
order
to
be
able
to
publish
a
rate
that
doesn't
comply
with
all
of
the
other
requirements
of
the
act,
which
you
can
do.
if
you
can
indicate
what
your
rates
are,
you
don't
need
the
special
permission,
you
can
go
in
for
30
days
otherwise,
you
will
have
to
take
longer.
the
commission
can
then
tell
you
how
much
notice
you
have
to
give
and
in
the
last
three
general
rate
increase
proceedings
it's
been
something
like
75
days,
45
days,
60
days,
it's
a
flexible
time
period.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
the
commission's
authority
in
terms
of
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
yes,
that
is
part
of
the
leverage
under
the
suspension
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
no.
no,
we
are
not
trying
to
get
into
question
of
rate
making.
what
we
say
is
the
commission
must
comply
with
nepa
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
that's
a
flexible
provision
in
this
context
and
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
no
effort,
no
good
faith
effort
to
comply
and
that's
the
basis
of
the
injunction
in
this
case.
it
doesn't
extend
to
the
broad
range
of
questions
that
we
have
been
discussing.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
no
your
honor,
it
said
and
all
it
said
was
that
there
will
be
no
--
it
appears
that
there
will
be
no
significant
effect
on
the
environmental
policy,
on
the
human
environment,
under
the
national
environment
policy
act.
it
didn't
explain
the
basis
for
that
and
the
district
court
wanted
to
know,
how
did
it
find
that.
it
had
said
in
other
rate
increase
proceedings
that
it
was
granting
hold
downs
on
recyclable
commodities,
in
other
words,
not
giving
the
railroads
all
they
wanted
for
environmental
reasons
and
it
said
in
a
draft
impact
statement,
in
this
case
that
there
might
be
a
significant
impact.
it's
behavior
was
entirely
ambiguous
and
the
district
court
was
confronted
with
what
we
submitted
properly
called
boilerplate
and
that
boilerplate,
the
commission
has
used
in
virtually
every
order
since
1970
when
nepa
took
effect.
the
commission
has
simply
not
made
an
effort,
in
this
or
any
other
case
to
comply
with
the
act.
the
court
found
that
and
that
was
the
basis
of
it's
ruling
under
nepa.
if
i
may
go
on
to
the
question
that
i
believe
you
asked
mr.
chief
justice
burger
regarding
legislative
history
of
nepa
and
the
power
of
the
court
to
issue
an
injunction
which
would
extend
beyond
the
seven
month
period.
it's
true
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
regarding
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
responsibilities.
what
is
in
the
statute,
the
statute
itself
are
two
things
which
we
consider
to
be
significant.
first
the
requirement
that
agencies
began
to
accommodate
their
procedures
to
the
requirements
of
nepa,
an
immediate
and
a
continuing
requirement
which
was
confirmed
almost
immediately
after
the
act
was
passed
by
a
presidential
order,
number
11514.
the
second
thing
is
section
103
of
nepa,
which
says
to
an
agency,
“if
you
have
a
problem,
if
you
can't
comply
with
the
act”
and
in
this
case
compliance
might
be
suspending
for
even
more
than
seven
months
while
they
study,
we
don't
say,
it
would
have
to
be,
but
it
might
be,
“then
you
come
back,
you
go
to
congress
and
you
say,
look
we
found
this
problem,
we
need
to
resolve
it.”
well,
the
commission
didn't
do
that.
the
commission
seems
to
think
that
there
is
no
problem,
but
if
we
reach
the
point
of
an
injunction
extending
beyond
seven
months,
we
submit
we
have
a
conflict
between
a
statute
nepa
which
to
be
effective
may
require
that
an
injunction
issue
until
the
commission
is
complied
with
it's
obligations
under
nepa
and
another
statute,
the
icc
act
which
limits
the
commission
to
seven
months.
in
this
circumstance,
we
think
that
the
conflict
in
the
light
of
the
commission's
behavior
ought
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
affirming
the
district
court's
very
effective
action.
i
would
to
like
to
leave
the
standing
question
principally
to
the
brief.
i
believe
that
there
really
is
no
serious
issue
here.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
injured.
they
alleged
injury
in
fact.
this
case
doesn't
simply
involve
five
law
students
and
it's
not
an
academic
exercise
for
them.
the
conservation
groups
that
i
represent,
represents
a
130,000
citizens.
these
people
use
and
enjoy
the
environment.
there
can't
be
any
dispute
about
that.
these
people
are
affected
in
their
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
environment
by
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirement
of
nepa
that
we
maximize
recycling.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
we
alleged
the
membership
of
each
of
the
organizations
in
our
complaint
your
honor
and
the
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that
was
as
i
was
going
to
address
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
there
was
no
proof
put
on
with
respect
to
the,
no
testimony
taken
i
should
say,
with
respect
to
our
membership.
we
would
be
shocked
if
anyone
would
challenge,
the
fact
that
we
represent
this
large
number
of
members
or
that
those
people
are
--
enjoy
the
environment
and
certainly
since
this
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
suppose
and
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
this
in
response
to
the
claim
of
the
railroads
that
our
allegations
were
not
sufficiently
precise
that
they
take
discovery
if
they
want.
when
we
go
back,
if
we
go
back
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
if
they
wish
to
challenge
such
a
basic
thing
as
the
veracity
of
our
membership.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
it's
accepted
boilerplate
and
it
is
also
something
that
we
can
prove
if
we
are
out
to
it.
this
was
a
preliminary
injunction
your
honor
and
when
we
go
back
if
we
go
back,
we
can
put
that
kind
of
proof
on.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
no,
your
honor
i
don't
believe
so
and
certainly
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
freight
rates
on
recycling
which
is
the
other
part
of
the
allegation
of
injury,
but
the
proof
was
that,
each
of
these
allegations
are
provable,
the
environmental
groups
alleged
in
injury
in
fact,
which
we
submit
a
sufficient
sierra
club.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
nothing,
one
point
person
is
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
correct
your
honor,
i
agree.
i
was
responding
to
the
point
about
the
five
law
students.
one
law
student,
one
person
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
and
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
regarding
effects
of
recycling
which
it
seems
to
me
is
the
essence
of
the
claim
of
lack
of
standing
usually
a
question
on
the
merits,
do
we
have
some
sort
of
standing
to
litigate
this
issue
on
the
merits
because
we
have
alleged
a
sufficient
effect
as
a
result
of
the
rate
increases
and
we
submit
there
was
impact
on
that.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
would
submit
he
had
standing,
he
might
not
prevail
on
the
merits
your
honor
but
he
is
--
and
in
fact
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
he
satisfies
the
injury
in
fact
half
of
the
standing
test,
i
am
not,
i
can't
respond
to
the
zone
of
interest
question
there,
because
i
don't
know
what
the
statute
is
but
i
don't
know
what
the
statute
is
here
and
it's
need
and
it
creates
a
right
to
submit
on
any
citizen
to
seek
to
obtain
from
the
government
an
impact
statement.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
any
citizen
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
have
a
position
here
taken
by
the
government
and
railroads
in
essence
that
if
it's
any
citizen
and
he
is
injured
to
the
same
degree
as
any
other
citizen
then
no
citizen
has
standing
and
we
submit
that's
a
ridiculous
rule.
it's
inconsistent.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
pardon.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
we
get
that
right
from
nepa
and
also
from
from
the
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
the
review
here
is
under
the
new
state
procedure.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
there
is
no
specific
statement
in
nepa
providing
a
citizen
suit
provision.
there
is
the
statement
in
nepa
that
the
citizen
shall
enjoy
a
healthy
environment.
there
is,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
although
this
isn't
in
our
brief,
the
testimony
of
the
council
on
environmental
quality
in
june
of
1971
before
the
house
committee
on
fisheries
and
wild
life
conservation
regarding
a
citizen
action
bill
in
which
the
council,
the
agency
which
was
responsible
for
interpreting
nepa
says
that
council
takes
the
position
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
other
similar
environmental
protection
legislation
confers
standing
on
concerned
citizens
and
citizen
groups
to
challenge
violations
of
that
legislation.
we
submit
the
standing
issue
is
clear.
briefly,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
reviewability,
to
point
out
that
nothing
in
arrow
dealt
specifically
with
reviewability,
it
dealt
with
injunctive
relief.
we
can
have
review
under
nepa
and
still
have
an
injunction
not
issued
and
there
is
no
indication
in
the
icc
act,
a
clear
and
convincing
legislative
intent
to
preclude
review.
there
is
no
indication
in
nepa
that
review
is
warranted
and
that
the
government
here
is
seeking
an
exemption
for
the
icc
at
least
with
respect
to
suspension
decisions
which
doesn't
require
any
other
federal
agency.
so
we
submit
that
the
plaintiffs
here
have
a
standing
under
the
sierra
problem
that
this
decision
by
the
commission,
the
suspension
order
can
be
reviewed.
that
on
review
of
it
the
district
court
properly
found
that
the
commission
had
taken
no
steps
in
this
or
any
other
case
to
attempt
to
comply
with
nepa
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
that
that
was
appropriate
and
that
an
injunction
should
have
issued
and
that
this
court
should
have
affirm
that
injunction.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
discussing
some
of
the
questions
which
have
been
raised
by
the
court
to
other
counsel
and
initially
to
reply
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
posed
to
mr.
cox,
regarding
the
relationship
between
nepa
and
this
court's
decision
in
arrow.
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
applying
nepa
is
a
very
different
decision,
a
very
different
set
of
facts
than
the
decision
involved
in
arrow.
arrow
involved
judicial
interference
with
rate
making.
arrow
involved
a
court
deciding
what
a
reasonable
rate
would
be,
issuing
an
injunction
on
that
basis.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
kind
of
exercise
of
discretion
which
we
acknowledge
is
committed
to
an
agency.
this
case
deals
with
clear,
unambiguous
procedures
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
imposes
upon
all
federal
agencies
not
including
the
courts
who
are
not
agencies
under
the
apa
and
whom
we
submit
are
not
agencies
under
nepa.
the
significance
of
the
difference
between
the
arrow
set
of
facts
and
the
set
of
facts
in
this
case
is
that
in
arrow,
it
could
be
said
that
a
court
was
interfering
with
the
congressional
decision
to
commit
discretion
to
the
agency.
here,
what
the
court
is
doing
is
enforcing
on
what
is
perhaps
the
most
recalcitrant
agency
among
federal
agencies
with
respect
to
nepa
the
clear
congressional
requirements.
it
is
working
to
enforce
congressional
requirements,
it
is
not
working
against
the
discretion
of
an
agency
which
congress
has
committed
to
that
agency.
what
the
court
did
was
see
that
the
commission
from
the
beginning
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
on
january
1,
1970
had
done
nothing
to
attempt
to
accommodate
its
practices
to
the
requirements
of
nepa.
the
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
as
early
as
october
1970,
the
council
on
environmental
quality
which
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
is
the
agency
which
we
could
say
would
have
the
responsibility
to
interpret
nepa,
had
told
the
commission,
it's
your
job
to
begun
to
comply
with
nepa.
it's
particularly
your
job
to
apply
its
procedures
in
order
to
fulfill
the
explicit
policy,
that
congress
set
forth
in
nepa.
the
clearest
policy,
the
clearest
substantive
policy
that
congress
set
was
to
enhance
the
quality
of
renewable
resources
and
approach
the
maximum
attainable
recycling
of
depletable
resources.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
don't
believe
that
the
agency
has
said
either
way
on
that
question.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that
was
we
submit
the
issue
before
the
district
court.
the
ceq
didn't
say
one
way
or
another.
it
clearly
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
your
honor
we
don't
have
a
case
statement
in
this
record
from
the
agency
with
respect
to
the
general
question
of
whether
the
commission
is
obliged
with
respect
to
rate
increase
proposals
to
submit
an
impact
statement
in
a
30-day
period.
we
do
have
statements
from
the
ceq
criticizing
the
commission's
compliance
with
nepa
in
this
case
and
i
submit
there
is
a
very
good
reason
why
we
don't
have
a
statement
by
the
ceq.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
the
commission
is
obliged
to
file
an
impact
statement
in
a
every
rate
proceeding
in
a
30-day
period.
that's
not
what
the
district
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
the
issue
your
honor,
i
am
afraid
i
don't
understand
you,
the
district
court
held
that
the
commission
had
not
complied
with
nepa
in
this
case
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
it
didn't
say
exactly
what
procedure
the
commission
would
have
to
comply
with.
it
expressly
indicated
that
if
the
commission
made
a
good
faith
showing
of
compliance
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
that
it
would
be
inclined
not
to
impose
an
impact
statement
requirement
on
the
commission
or
to
indicate
that
its
order
had
violated
the
nepa.
the
commission
has
never
taken
the
position
until
it
arrived
in
court,
and
it
was
taken
by
its
lawyers
that
it's
an
impossibility
for
to
comply
with
the
act
in
a
30-day
period.
the
30-day
period
is
something
of
a
false
issue,
mr.
justice
white
because
rate
decisions
are
not
made,
at
least
general
rate
increase
proceedings
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
are
not
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
one
thing
the
commission
could
do
your
honor
and
other
thing
that
commission
to
do
was,
as
it
has
in
the
most
recent
general
rate
increase
proceedings,
tell
the
railroads
that
they
don't
have
special
permission
to
file
a
rate
within
a
short
period
of
time,
that
they
have
to
give
the
public
75
days
notice
or
90
days
notice
or
whatever
period
of
time
is
appropriate.
and
in
that
time
the
commission
can
comply
with
the
act
of
the
fullest
extent
possible,
and
that
i
submit
is
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
gives
the
commission,
not
the
power,
not
really
with
the
power,
but
the
duty
to
comply
with
the
act
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
no
your
honor
it
doesn't.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
in
case
where
an
environmental
impact
is
asserted,
it
may
well
be
that
one
doesn't
exist
and
in
those
circumstances
a
commission
finding
of
no
significant
environmental
impact,
if
it's
based
on
a
record
and
if
its
adequately
explained
or
at
least
if
the
district
court
can
figure
out
what
the
commission
did
would
suffice
or
in
review.
in
some
circumstances
where
you
have
a
general
rate
increase
proceeding,
where
you
have
a
rate
increase
on
recyclable
materials,
whether
is
a
significant
environmental
impact,
then
we
submit
it
is
appropriate
to
throw
out
the
30-day
proceeding
because
nepa
requires
that.
but
we
want
to
stress
that
the
30-day
issue
is
somewhat
false,
because
more
time
is
permitted
to
the
commission
under
the
act
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
nepa's
requirements
as
interpreted
by
the
ceq
guidelines,
and
i'll
refer
you
to
the
section
10
of
the
guidelines
is
flexible
to
permit
an
agency
to
come
to
the
ceq
and
say
look
we
have
these
problems,
this
is
how
we
want
to
comply
with
the
act,
this
is
what
we
think
is
compliance
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
and
the
ceq
would
say
alright.
but
in
further
response
to
what
mr.
justice
white
was
asking,
“commission
never
went
to
the
ceq.”
the
ceq's
communications
with
the
commission
have
indicated
that
the
commission
has
to
comply
with
nepa,
it
has
to
begun
and
it
should
have
been
gone
on
january
1st
1970
to
consider
the
effects
of
its
permitting
rights
to
continue
to
go
into
the
effect
on
recyclable
materials
and
it
hasn't
done
that.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
our
argument
is
that's
one
possibility
that
the
commission
could
employ
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
act.
there
are
others
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
even
if
they
didn't
suspend
your
honor,
they
could
do
something.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
for
example
they
could
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
and
let's
take
the
assumption
that
30
days
is
what
their
limit
too
which
i
think
is
not
the
case,
but
within
the
30-day
period
they
could
submit
an
outline
of
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement.
they
could
take
their
general
experience
and
the
evidence
that
the
parties
submit,
and
the
evidence
that
their
own
staff
develops
which
they
didn't
do
in
this
case,
and
they
could
make
a
decision;
a
good
faith
decision
whether
or
not
there
was
a
significant
environmental
impact.
as
the
solicitor
general
earlier
argued,
if
that
decision
is
supportable,
then
they
don't
have
any
further
requirement.
if
it's
not
and
if
there
is
an
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
there
maybe
circumstances
where
for
example
the
railroads
propose
a
change
in
one
rate,
and
it
will
go
into
the
effect
in
30
days
and
in
that
period
if
environmental
impact
may
exist
and
it's
alleged,
we
submit
the
commission
should
consider
whether
there
is
a
significant
environmental
impact
from
say
that
one
rate
and
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
among
the
things
that
would
be
open
to
the
commission
would
be
to
file
a
draft
impact
statement,
to
file
an
outline
of
draft
impact
statement
to
indicate
how
it's
going
to
go
about
complying
with
nepa,
to
indicate
the
process
it's
going
to
follow,
to
make
a
decision
in
good
faith
that
there
is
no
significant
environmental
impact.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
within
in
the
time
period
that
the
commission
has.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
it
is
not,
your
honor
in
a
general
rating
increase
proceedings
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
because
the
railroads
when
they
come
in
with
a
request
raise
general
rates,
as
i
understand
it
as
now
as
a
practical
matter
you
have
to
come
in
with
what's
called
a
master
terrier
instead
of
coming
in
as
i
understand
it,
with
an
indication
of
what
the
rate
on
scrap
on
between
buick
and
omaha
is
and
for
every
other
rate
in
the
country
they
come
in
with
general
guides.
this
doesn't
comply
with
other
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
i
understand
it,
meaning
section
4
and
others.
so
they
have
to
ask
for
a
special
permission
as
a
practical
matter
whatever
the
detail
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
one
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
you'd
have
to
ask
for
a
special
permission
in
order
to
be
able
to
publish
a
rate
that
doesn't
comply
with
all
of
the
other
requirements
of
the
act,
which
you
can
do.
if
you
can
indicate
what
your
rates
are,
you
don't
need
the
special
permission,
you
can
go
in
for
30
days
otherwise,
you
will
have
to
take
longer.
the
commission
can
then
tell
you
how
much
notice
you
have
to
give
and
in
the
last
three
general
rate
increase
proceedings
it's
been
something
like
75
days,
45
days,
60
days,
it's
a
flexible
time
period.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
the
commission's
authority
in
terms
of
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
yes,
that
is
part
of
the
leverage
under
the
suspension
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
no.
no,
we
are
not
trying
to
get
into
question
of
rate
making.
what
we
say
is
the
commission
must
comply
with
nepa
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
that's
a
flexible
provision
in
this
context
and
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
no
effort,
no
good
faith
effort
to
comply
and
that's
the
basis
of
the
injunction
in
this
case.
it
doesn't
extend
to
the
broad
range
of
questions
that
we
have
been
discussing.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
no
your
honor,
it
said
and
all
it
said
was
that
there
will
be
no
--
it
appears
that
there
will
be
no
significant
effect
on
the
environmental
policy,
on
the
human
environment,
under
the
national
environment
policy
act.
it
didn't
explain
the
basis
for
that
and
the
district
court
wanted
to
know,
how
did
it
find
that.
it
had
said
in
other
rate
increase
proceedings
that
it
was
granting
hold
downs
on
recyclable
commodities,
in
other
words,
not
giving
the
railroads
all
they
wanted
for
environmental
reasons
and
it
said
in
a
draft
impact
statement,
in
this
case
that
there
might
be
a
significant
impact.
it's
behavior
was
entirely
ambiguous
and
the
district
court
was
confronted
with
what
we
submitted
properly
called
boilerplate
and
that
boilerplate,
the
commission
has
used
in
virtually
every
order
since
1970
when
nepa
took
effect.
the
commission
has
simply
not
made
an
effort,
in
this
or
any
other
case
to
comply
with
the
act.
the
court
found
that
and
that
was
the
basis
of
it's
ruling
under
nepa.
if
i
may
go
on
to
the
question
that
i
believe
you
asked
mr.
chief
justice
burger
regarding
legislative
history
of
nepa
and
the
power
of
the
court
to
issue
an
injunction
which
would
extend
beyond
the
seven
month
period.
it's
true
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
regarding
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
responsibilities.
what
is
in
the
statute,
the
statute
itself
are
two
things
which
we
consider
to
be
significant.
first
the
requirement
that
agencies
began
to
accommodate
their
procedures
to
the
requirements
of
nepa,
an
immediate
and
a
continuing
requirement
which
was
confirmed
almost
immediately
after
the
act
was
passed
by
a
presidential
order,
number
11514.
the
second
thing
is
section
103
of
nepa,
which
says
to
an
agency,
“if
you
have
a
problem,
if
you
can't
comply
with
the
act”
and
in
this
case
compliance
might
be
suspending
for
even
more
than
seven
months
while
they
study,
we
don't
say,
it
would
have
to
be,
but
it
might
be,
“then
you
come
back,
you
go
to
congress
and
you
say,
look
we
found
this
problem,
we
need
to
resolve
it.”
well,
the
commission
didn't
do
that.
the
commission
seems
to
think
that
there
is
no
problem,
but
if
we
reach
the
point
of
an
injunction
extending
beyond
seven
months,
we
submit
we
have
a
conflict
between
a
statute
nepa
which
to
be
effective
may
require
that
an
injunction
issue
until
the
commission
is
complied
with
it's
obligations
under
nepa
and
another
statute,
the
icc
act
which
limits
the
commission
to
seven
months.
in
this
circumstance,
we
think
that
the
conflict
in
the
light
of
the
commission's
behavior
ought
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
affirming
the
district
court's
very
effective
action.
i
would
to
like
to
leave
the
standing
question
principally
to
the
brief.
i
believe
that
there
really
is
no
serious
issue
here.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
injured.
they
alleged
injury
in
fact.
this
case
doesn't
simply
involve
five
law
students
and
it's
not
an
academic
exercise
for
them.
the
conservation
groups
that
i
represent,
represents
a
130,000
citizens.
these
people
use
and
enjoy
the
environment.
there
can't
be
any
dispute
about
that.
these
people
are
affected
in
their
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
environment
by
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirement
of
nepa
that
we
maximize
recycling.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
we
alleged
the
membership
of
each
of
the
organizations
in
our
complaint
your
honor
and
the
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that
was
as
i
was
going
to
address
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
there
was
no
proof
put
on
with
respect
to
the,
no
testimony
taken
i
should
say,
with
respect
to
our
membership.
we
would
be
shocked
if
anyone
would
challenge,
the
fact
that
we
represent
this
large
number
of
members
or
that
those
people
are
--
enjoy
the
environment
and
certainly
since
this
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
suppose
and
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
this
in
response
to
the
claim
of
the
railroads
that
our
allegations
were
not
sufficiently
precise
that
they
take
discovery
if
they
want.
when
we
go
back,
if
we
go
back
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
if
they
wish
to
challenge
such
a
basic
thing
as
the
veracity
of
our
membership.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
it's
accepted
boilerplate
and
it
is
also
something
that
we
can
prove
if
we
are
out
to
it.
this
was
a
preliminary
injunction
your
honor
and
when
we
go
back
if
we
go
back,
we
can
put
that
kind
of
proof
on.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
no,
your
honor
i
don't
believe
so
and
certainly
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
freight
rates
on
recycling
which
is
the
other
part
of
the
allegation
of
injury,
but
the
proof
was
that,
each
of
these
allegations
are
provable,
the
environmental
groups
alleged
in
injury
in
fact,
which
we
submit
a
sufficient
sierra
club.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
nothing,
one
point
person
is
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
correct
your
honor,
i
agree.
i
was
responding
to
the
point
about
the
five
law
students.
one
law
student,
one
person
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
and
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
regarding
effects
of
recycling
which
it
seems
to
me
is
the
essence
of
the
claim
of
lack
of
standing
usually
a
question
on
the
merits,
do
we
have
some
sort
of
standing
to
litigate
this
issue
on
the
merits
because
we
have
alleged
a
sufficient
effect
as
a
result
of
the
rate
increases
and
we
submit
there
was
impact
on
that.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
would
submit
he
had
standing,
he
might
not
prevail
on
the
merits
your
honor
but
he
is
--
and
in
fact
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
he
satisfies
the
injury
in
fact
half
of
the
standing
test,
i
am
not,
i
can't
respond
to
the
zone
of
interest
question
there,
because
i
don't
know
what
the
statute
is
but
i
don't
know
what
the
statute
is
here
and
it's
need
and
it
creates
a
right
to
submit
on
any
citizen
to
seek
to
obtain
from
the
government
an
impact
statement.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
any
citizen
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
have
a
position
here
taken
by
the
government
and
railroads
in
essence
that
if
it's
any
citizen
and
he
is
injured
to
the
same
degree
as
any
other
citizen
then
no
citizen
has
standing
and
we
submit
that's
a
ridiculous
rule.
it's
inconsistent.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
pardon.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
we
get
that
right
from
nepa
and
also
from
from
the
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
the
review
here
is
under
the
new
state
procedure.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
there
is
no
specific
statement
in
nepa
providing
a
citizen
suit
provision.
there
is
the
statement
in
nepa
that
the
citizen
shall
enjoy
a
healthy
environment.
there
is,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
although
this
isn't
in
our
brief,
the
testimony
of
the
council
on
environmental
quality
in
june
of
1971
before
the
house
committee
on
fisheries
and
wild
life
conservation
regarding
a
citizen
action
bill
in
which
the
council,
the
agency
which
was
responsible
for
interpreting
nepa
says
that
council
takes
the
position
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
other
similar
environmental
protection
legislation
confers
standing
on
concerned
citizens
and
citizen
groups
to
challenge
violations
of
that
legislation.
we
submit
the
standing
issue
is
clear.
briefly,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
reviewability,
to
point
out
that
nothing
in
arrow
dealt
specifically
with
reviewability,
it
dealt
with
injunctive
relief.
we
can
have
review
under
nepa
and
still
have
an
injunction
not
issued
and
there
is
no
indication
in
the
icc
act,
a
clear
and
convincing
legislative
intent
to
preclude
review.
there
is
no
indication
in
nepa
that
review
is
warranted
and
that
the
government
here
is
seeking
an
exemption
for
the
icc
at
least
with
respect
to
suspension
decisions
which
doesn't
require
any
other
federal
agency.
so
we
submit
that
the
plaintiffs
here
have
a
standing
under
the
sierra
problem
that
this
decision
by
the
commission,
the
suspension
order
can
be
reviewed.
that
on
review
of
it
the
district
court
properly
found
that
the
commission
had
taken
no
steps
in
this
or
any
other
case
to
attempt
to
comply
with
nepa
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
that
that
was
appropriate
and
that
an
injunction
should
have
issued
and
that
this
court
should
have
affirm
that
injunction.
