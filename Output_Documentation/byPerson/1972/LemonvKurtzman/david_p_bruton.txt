mr.
david
p.
bruton
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
litigation
is
now
before
this
tribunal
for
the
second
time.
on
the
first
occasion,
this
court
ruled
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
that
pennsylvania
act
109
providing
aid
to
nonpublic
schools
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
under
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
the
case
has
returned
here
again
because
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
affect
and
purpose
of
that
prior
ruling,
and
the
question
which
is
now
presented
is
whether
the
commonwealth
can
now
disperse
an
additional
$24
million
approximately,
under
the
statute
which
has
been
held
unconstitutional
to
pennsylvania’s
sectarian
schools.
the
relevant
facts
i
think
are
these,
and
they
fall
into
two
categories,
first
with
respect
to
pennsylvania
act
109
itself.
that
statute
provided
a
scheme
for
subsidy
to
the
nonpublic
schools
in
the
form
of
reimbursement
for
certain
so
called
“secular
education
services”
as
defined
in
the
statute.
and
the
expenses
which
could
be
reimbursed
under
the
statute
included
the
cost
of
teacher
salaries,
textbooks,
and
instructional
materials
for
certain
specified
types
of
courses
of
instruction.
and
the
areas
of
instruction
which
were
included
were
mathematics,
modern
foreign
languages,
physical
sciences
and
physical
education.
the
schools
became
eligible
for
reimbursement
under
this
statute
by
entering
into
in
the
scheme
of
the
statute
certain
agreements,
purchase
of
service
contracts.
and
under
these
agreements
they
were
to
be
paid
by
the
state
in
the
subsequent
school
year
for
these
so
called
services
which
were
rendered
during
the
prior
year.
now,
it
was
not
of
course
necessary
for
any
school
to
show
that
it
had
in
fact
added
any
new
teachers,
admitted
any
new
pupils,
hired
any
new
textbooks
or
otherwise
really
incurred
any
new
expenses
in
order
to
receive
aid
under
the
statute.
all
it
was
required
that
it
was
the
school
satisfied
the
state
that
the
expenditures
in
question
fell
within
the
defined
statutory
categories
and,
this
is
a
very
vital
“and”
i
think,
that
the
services
for
which
reimbursement
was
sought
were
in
fact
secular,
and
did
not
include
any
subject
matter
expressing
religious
teaching
or
the
morals,
or
beliefs
of
any
particular
sect.
the
commonwealth
was
given
extensive
administrative
powers
in
carrying
out
the
purpose
of
this
statute
with
the
right
to
audit
the
performance
of
each
school
and
its
books
and
records
to
make
sure
that
the
expenditures
were
properly
made.
this
then,
in
brief
summary,
is
the
scheme
of
the
statute.
i’d
like
to
turn
now
to
the
chronology
of
events
here,
which
i
think
is
quite
significant.
the
statute
was
passed
in
june
of
1968,
and
within
one
month
the
plaintiffs
announced
publicly
and
this
was
in
the
news
media,
that
they
intended
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
this
act.
of
course,
the
suit
itself
could
not
be
brought
until
it
was
clear
that
the
statute
was
operational
that
in
fact
funds
were
going
to
be
disbursed
under
it,
otherwise
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
claim
could
be
dismissed
as
premature.
and
it
was
not
until
six
months
later,
at
the
end
of
1968
that
the
state
issued
rules
and
regulations
and
forms
and
so
forth
which
could
be
submitted
by
schools
seeking
subsidy
under
the
act.
now,
these
so
called
agreements
were
to
be
submitted
by
january
15th
of
1969
with
schedules
identifying
the
classes,
the
number
of
pupils
and
so
forth.
and
then
in
june,
at
the
end
of
the
school
year,
additional
schedules
were
to
be
submitted
which
detail
the
precise
items
of
expenditure
that
they
were
seeking
reimbursement
for.
once
it
was
clear
that
the
statute
was
indeed
operational,
plaintiffs
filed
suit.
now,
this
was
in
july
of
1969.
at
that
time
the
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
and
i
may
say
to
the
considerable
surprise
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
district
court
panel
in
a
2-1
decision
over
the
dissent
of
chief
justice
--
chief
judge
hastie
granted
that
motion
to
dismiss.
plaintiffs
immediately
appealed
to
this
court.
within
six
weeks,
after
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
schools
again
entered
into
these
contracts
which
are
annual
in
nature
on
the
15th
of
january
1970,
and
it’s
at
this
point,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
correct
a
factual
error
which
is
in
the
record
and
it
has
been
in
the
record
i’m
afraid
from
the
time
this
case
was
presented
to
the
district
court
on
remand.
and
i
think
that
mr.
ball
and
i
are
in
agreement
that
we
can
now
stipulate
to
this
change.
and
the
change
is
this,
it
was
stated
below
by
the
defendants
that
on
january
15,
1970
the
schools
entered
into
contracts
for
services
to
be
rendered
in
the
subsequent
school
year
1970
to
1971.
we
have
repeated
that
statement
in
the
briefs
that
we
have
filed
here.
that
is
not
correct.
the
contracts
that
were
signed
on
the
15th
of
january
1970
were
applicable
to
services
provided
in
that
school
year
that
was
already
half
over
1969-1970.
and
it
was
therefore
not
until
a
year
later,
january
15,
1971
that
agreements
were
entered
into
by
the
schools
covering
services
for
the
1970-1971
school
year.
there
is
a
one
year
difference
there,
and
although
i
frankly
don’t
believe
that
it’s
critical
to
the
plaintiffs’
case
here,
i
think
it
does
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
arguments
of
the
defendants
have
made
as
i
come
to
in
a
minute.
the
facts
that
these
agreements
were
not
signed
until
the
15th
of
january
1971,
means
that
a
number
of
other
intervening
events
have
occurred.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’m
now
referring
to
agreements
covering
the
1970-1971
school
year
that
is
the
year
and
the
only
year
which
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
right,
halfway
through
that
year.
the
state
has
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
yes,
september
1,
i
think
is
essentially
the
beginning.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
correct.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that.
the
funds
that
the
commonwealth
collected
for
those
years
have
already
been
disbursed
to
the
schools,
and
the
plaintiffs
are
not
here
seeking
a
return
of
any
moneys
which
have
already
been
paid
out.
we
are
seeking
only
an
order
which
would
bar
any
further
payment
of
funds
which
the
commonwealth
still
has.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i
do
not
have
that
figure.
i
believe
it
was
something
less
than
the
sum
that
we
now
have
here.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
about
$24
or
$25
million
approximately.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
it
is
the
date
which
was
established
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
schedule
which
was
put
out
by
the
state
itself
with
its
rules
and
regulations
when
they
were
issued
under
the
statute.
what
they
did
was
set
a
specific
schedule
for
the
1968-1969
year
and
then
said
it’s
the
same
schedule
every
year
thereafter
year
after
year.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i
do
not
believe
at
this
time
that
there
is,
your
honor.
i
think
we’re
now
focusing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
impact
of
this
court’s
decision
in
june
of
1971,
whatever
the
situation
may
have
been
before
that,
whether
the
impact
of
this
court’s
decision
in
june
of
1971
was
to
prevent
any
further
disbursements
under
the
unconstitutional
statute
thereafter.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
it
would
have
been
against
the
disbursements.
that
is
of
course
the
ultimate
nexus
the
focus
of
the
case.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
constitutionally
i
would
say
yes,
because
i
think
that
there
is
at
least
since
the
tidal
oil
case
in
1924.
it
is
clear
that
a
judicial
decision
nullifying
a
statute
can
have
full
retroactive
operation.
we
do
not
urge
it.
we
do
not
urge
it
here
and
whether
on
a
less
than
constitutional
plan
as
a
matter
of
policy,
this
court
would
determine
if
it
were
presented
that
question
that
it
was
appropriate
to
apply
the
decision
that
retroactively.
i
think
is
a
different
matter
and
one
that
[voice
overlap].
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i
think
in
that
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
yes,
i
think
i
have
reference
to
the
standards
which
have
been
suggested
in
linkletter
and
certain
other
cases
in
which
it’s
been
indicated
that
when
one
is
considering
retroactive
application,
one
ought
to
look
at
the
substance
of
the
rule
which
is
laid
down,
and
determine
whether
the
policy
that
lies
behind
that
rule
will
be
offended
or
not
if
only
a
prospective
application
is
given.
i
think
you’d
have
to
look
at
the
question
of
whether
you
would
be
really
remedying
or
preserving
the
integrity,
if
you
will,
of
the
rationale
behind
this
court’s
decision
in
lemon
by
ordering
a
return
of
those
prior
funds.
i
suggest
that
there
is
a
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
case
at
bar.
and
the
difference
is
this.
this
court,
i
think,
focused
principally
in
its
decision
which
came
down
in
june
of
1971,
holding
that
act
109
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
on
the
question
of
entanglement.
i
think
there
are
other
threads
that
can
be
discerned
in
the
fabric
of
the
opinions
of
the
court,
but
i
think
this
is
we’ll
assume
for
the
moment
the
primary
one.
and
as
to
entanglement,
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendants
here
that
all
the
entanglement
that
there
might
be
under
this
statute
has
already
occurred
with
respect
to
1970-1971.
in
effect,
the
horse
has
been
stolen,
there’s
no
point
in
locking
the
barn
now.
this
contention,
the
plaintiffs
disagree
with
vigorously.
we
say
that
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record.
in
fact,
there
is
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
there
has
been
the
kind
of
discriminating
meaningful
inquiry
by
the
commonwealth
into
the
applications
which
have
been
submitted
by
over
a
thousand
schools,
most
of
them
sectarian,
to
insure
that
these
funds
would
not
be
used
in
fact
for
the
furtherance
of
religious
purposes
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
and
not
only
is
there
no
evidence
in
the
record
whatsoever
to
support
the
position
of
the
defendants
on
this
point.
they
asked
simply
that
you
conclusively
presume
that
all
this
has
been
done.
i
think
there
is
now
evidence,
and
we’ve
referred
to
it
in
our
supplemental
brief
filed
only
last
week
that
indicates
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
the
commonwealth
has
advised
one
of
the
named
defendant
schools
in
this
very
litigation.
the
montgomery
--
philadelphia
montgomery
christian
academy
and
certain
other
schools
that
they
are
not
eligible
for
any
aid
under
act
109,
whatever
remaining
aid
there
may
be
under
it.
because
in
the
by-laws
or
a
charter
of
the
institution,
there
is
reference
made
to
the
fact
that
the
god’s
creation
has
a
bearing
on
the
teaching
practices
of
that
institution.
and
i
think
my
witty
opponent
mr.
ball,
would
be
the
first
one
to
concede
that
the
application
of
that
kind
of
administrative
standard
in
making
these
determinations
if
applied
to
all
of
the
schools
in
the
state
would
disqualify
every
catholic
parochial
school
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
about
that.
the
montgomery
academy
confronted
with
this
decision
brought
suit
against
the
commonwealth
in
the
federal
district
court
seeking
to
have
a
reversal.
they
were
told
not
surprisingly
at
that
point,
this
occurring
after
the
decision
of
this
court
striking
down
act
109,
they
were
told
that
they
could
not
have
a
hearing
to
review
the
administrative
determination
made
by
the
state
because
that
would
create
the
very
entanglement
which
this
court
has
said
is
forbidden
by
the
religion
clauses.
and
so
you
have
a
conundrum,
you
have
an
apparently
arbitrary
decision
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
there
are
two
years
in
question
in
that
case.
one
of
them
is
1970-1971,
one
of
them
is
1969
and
1970,
in
which
is
also
interesting
and
i’ll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
therefore,
i
submit
that
the
evidence
is
that
there
has
not
been
the
kind
of
discriminating
inquiry
that
the
really
terribly
difficult
question
of
looking
into
the
classroom,
and
that’s
what
it
came
down
to
in
this
case.
to
determine
whether
in
fact
these
expenditures
would
be
for
secular
purposes.
and
therefore,
i
suggest
that
to
permit
the
disbursement
of
the
$24
million
now
would
run
directly
afoul
of
the
rationale
of
this
court’s
decision
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman.
unless
of
course
you
simply
say,
“pay
the
money
out
without
any
further
inquiry.”
and
that
i
think
would
run
afoul
of
this
court’s
decision
because
it
would
be
done
without
any
insurance
that
you
weren’t
directly
violating
the
establishment
clause.
now,
turn
to
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
i’ve
been
speaking
now
out
in
terms
of
the
rationale
of
this
court’s
prior
ruling
in
whether
it
would
be
offended.
looking
now
to
the
other
side,
are
there
any
interests
here
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
schools
which
would
warrant
an
exception
to
what
i
submit
is
the
usual
effect
given
to
a
judicial
decision?
and
as
to
whether
it
is
the
usual
effect
without
getting
in
to
the
nice
philosophical
distinctions
between
the
blackstonian
approach
and
the
brooding
omnipresence
in
the
sky
and
so
forth,
and
the
more
contemporary
realistic
approach.
i
do
think
it’s
clear
that
it
has
long
been
recognized
and
for
good
reason
that
judicial
rulemaking
is
essentially
retroactive,
unless
there
is
good
reason
to
make
exception
to
that.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
constitutional
rulings
primarily
although
i
think
one
can
find
precedence
which
address
the
same
problem
even
in
other
areas
of
which
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
surely,
injunctions
by
their
very
nature
or
not,
yes.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
principally.
i
don’t
think
i
have
to
address
other
areas.
for
example,
without
getting
into
it,
there
are
areas
i
suppose
open
to
question
when
a
court
interprets
a
statute
in
one
way
and
then
reverses
itself
in
another
case
in
some
time
later
and
interprets
the
statute
in
another
way.
there
are
questions
there
whether
that
is
a
retroactive,
if
you
will,
interpretation
of
the
statute.
usually,
i
think
it’s
held
that
it
is.
although
there
maybe
some
exceptional
cases.
but
certainly,
in
the
area
of
constitutional
adjudication,
i
think
the
general
rule
is
that
it
is
retroactive
unless
there
is
sound
reason
to
depart
from
that,
and
the
two
principal
areas
of
exception
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief.
of
course
the
bond
cases
where
you
have
public
bonds
being
issued
in
reliance
on
the
validity
of
the
procedures
involved,
and
then
those
procedures
are
struck
down.
this
court
has,
on
many
occasions,
expressed
reluctance
and
unwillingness
to
hold
that
those
bonds
now
in
the
hands
of
innocent
holders
are
void,
and
that
the
money
that
has
been
paid
for,
that
is
simply
to
be
forfeited.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
this
is
exactly
what
i’m
coming
to.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
so-called
agreements,
i
think
there’re
several
points
to
be
made
here.
with
regard
to
the
so-called
agreements
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
well,
i
think
there’s
a
real
question,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
these
agreements
are
true
contracts
in
the
sense
of
a
quid
pro
quo
between
the
commonwealth
and
the
schools.
the
schools
don’t
have
to
show
that
they
are
really
hiring
any
new
teachers,
adding
any
new
pupils,
incurring
any
new
expenditure
in
order
to
be
reimbursed.
essentially
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
they’re
really
being
subsidized
for
doing
what
they
would
be
doing
anyway.
now,
i
know
that
defendants
have
cited
cases
which
indicate
that,
at
least
in
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
a
very
technical
approach
to
aspects
of
consideration
can
be
taken
and
you
can
say
there
are
valid
contracts
under
contract
law.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
perhaps.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
right.
perhaps
there
is
an
ultimate
quid
pro
quo.
i
think
it
depends
in
this
sense
on
whether
the,
i
call
them
in
terrorem.
i
think
kind
of
arguments
that
are
made
here
are
true.
that
is
that
without
the
subsidy,
you
will
have
widespread
closing
of
the
private
school
system
and
that
otherwise
this
great
burden
will
fall
upon
the
public
school
system.
i
suggest
that
the
record
doesn’t
really
indicate
that
that’s
the
fact.
it’s
not
the
parochial
schools
who
didn’t
open
this
fall
for
lack
of
funds
in
philadelphia.
it’s
the
public
school
system
that
didn’t
have
the
money
to
pay
its
teachers
and
its
two-and-a-half
weeks
late.
it’s
the
public
schools
who
may
have
to
close
early
next
spring.
but
in
that
ultimate
sense
if
that
were
ultimately
shown
to
be
the
case,
i
guess
it
could
be
said
yes,
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo.
i
suggest
it
need
not
be
assumed
to
be
true
at
this
point,
and
in
respect
of
the
particular
years
involved,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
the
schools
would
have
incurred
these
expenses
anyway.
secondly,
you
have
a
fact
that
the
commonwealth
itself
has
regarded
this
statutory
scheme
as
essentially
a
subsidy.
again,
i
point
to
the
case
referred
to
in
our
supplemental
brief.
the
philadelphia
montgomery
christian
academy
was
told
by
the
commonwealth
in
july
of
1970
that
it
would
receive
no
payments
in
respect
of
services
provided
during
the
preceding
school
year,
1969-1970.
and
interestingly
enough
the
district
court
never
faced
that
question
when
it
dismissed
the
academy’s
complaint.
the
commonwealth
didn’t
talk
about
contractual
reliance
there,
equitable
obligations,
contractual
obligations.
they
treated
it
as
a
subsidy
which
could
and
should
be
cut
off
at
any
time
the
state
decided
that
it
was
improper.
and
this
is
precisely
the
position
that
we’re
taking.
i
think
the
actions
of
the
commonwealth
confirm
it.
third,
the
fact
is
that
because
the
contracts
were
not
entered
into
for
the
year
in
question
until
january
15,
1971,
the
schools
had
already
incurred
whatever
expenses
there
were
in
teaching
the
subjects
they
were
halfway
through
the
school
year,
and
the
single
most
important
sentence
i
think
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
justified
the
decision
below
is
this,
and
i’m
quoting
from
our
jurisdictional
statement
page
9
of
the
appendix.
“in
reliance
on
these
contracts
--“
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’m
sorry.
it’s
the
appendix
your
honor,
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
--
rather
than
the
appendix
itself.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
page
9
of
the
appendix
which
is
toward
the
rear.
the
bottom
paragraph
on
that
page
the
court
said
“in
reliance
on
these
contracts”
and
it
used
the
word
contracts
in
quotes
because
it
wasn’t
deciding
whether
they
were
really
contracts
or
not,
“the
nonpublic
schools
adjusted
their
budgets
accordingly
and
performed
the
services
required
by
them.”
my
proposition
is
how
can
you
rely
on
contracts
that
haven’t
even
been
entered
into?
and
i
think,
i
can
only
assume
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
court
below
had
in
mind
that
these
contracts
had
been
signed
on
january
15,
1970
not
january
15,
1971.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
you’ve
anticipated
my
next
point
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
that
is
the
next
dimension
of
the
argument
that
the
defendants
are
making
that
they
thought
the
statute
was
constitutional.
they
say
they
assumed
it
was
going
to
continue
to
be
so
and
that
therefore
they
could
continue
to
rely
on
this
subsidy
which
they
had
had
in
prior
years.
and
i
think
there,
it’s
relevant
to
look
at
the
question
of
what
really
were
the
expectations
of
the
parties
here.
this
is
not,
as
we
had
made
clear,
a
case
of
an
overruling
of
prior
precedent.
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
statute
was
passed
and
from
the
very
beginning,
every
party
involved
would
it
recognized
that
its
constitutionality
was
open
to
serious
question.
everyone
knew
it
was
going
to
be
taken
to
the
courts
and
that
ultimately
this
court
was
going
to
have
to
decide
the
issue.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
the
first
decision,
i’m
not
sure
i
know
which
decision
you’re
referring
to.
the
first
decision
in
the
district
court
was
in
november
of
1969.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
and
that
was
to
the
effect
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
they
dismissed
the
complaint.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
the
second
decision
was
not
rendered
until
after
remand
from
this
court,
which
was
in
i
think
november
of
1971.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
correct.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that
--
it
is
correct.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
dicenso
case
came
down
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
june
of
1970
before
the
school
year
in
question
here
eight
months
before
the
contracts
were
signed,
unanimously
striking
down
a
very
similar
statute
concerning
salary
supplements.
this
court’s
decision
in
walz
versus
commissioner
which
to
be
sure
held
that
tax
deductions
for
religious
contributions
were
appropriate,
the
rationale
of
that
decision
certainly
prefigured
the
ultimate
result
in
this
case.
and
narrow
really
the
area
of
permissible
involvement
i
think
between
church
and
state
and
focused
on
the
problem
of
entanglement.
all
of
these
things
were
intervening.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’ll
be
happy
to.
let
me
start
first
with
the
argument
that
the
defendants
have
made.
they
have
said
in
effect
that
in
the
absence
of
any
proof,
it
falls
on
the
plaintiff
and
that
you
must
presume
that
everything
has
been
done
and
that
there
is
full
reliance
here.
perhaps
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i’ve
misanticipated
the
direction
of
your
question.
i
was
going
to
focus
on
whether
the
plaintiffs
or
the
defendants
had
to
show
that
all
had
been
done
by
the
state
that’s
necessary
to
be
done.
but
perhaps
your
question
was
directed
to
different
point.
i
want
to
be
sure
on
response.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
well,
they’ve
cited
the
allen
case
for
the
proposition
that
on
this
kind
of
record
it
must
be
presumed
that
the
state
has
been
doing
everything
right,
and
that
at
this
point,
this
money
can
be
distributed.
and
i
only
want
to
distinguish
what
this
court
did
in
allen
from
what
this
court
did
in
this
case
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman,
where
it
specifically
declined
to
assume
on
a
basis
of
a
bare
bones
record
that
there
could
be
no
entanglement
here.
allen
was
dealing
with
textbooks.
the
judgment
there
was
that
you
can’t
assume
that
the
state
isn’t
able
to
choose
the
right
kind
of
textbooks
in
approving
textbooks
for
the
parochial
schools.
in
this
case
where
you
have
teacher
salaries
involved
and
so
forth,
the
presumption
was
to
the
contrary
that
there
would
have
to
be
entanglement,
so
that
i’m
saying
that
i
don’t
think
the
defendant’s
citation
of
allen
is
well
founded
on
this
point.
plus
the
fact
that
i
say
the
record
does
have
positive
evidence
indicating
that
the
state
is
not
doing
what
it
would
have
to
do
really
to
take
care
of
its
constitutional
obligations
here.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that
is
certainly
often
done.
i
can
only
say
here,
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
expense
to
the
plaintiffs
would
have
been
in
seeking
such
a
stay,
or
any
kind
of
an
injunction.
they
would’ve
been
holding
up
funds
and
they
decided
not
to
hold
up
those
funds,
and
as
i
say
again
we’re
not
seeking
now
to
undo
those
payments.
the
payments
that
were
made
during
the
period
between
trial
and
appeal
had
been,
and
we’re
not
asking
to
reverse
them.
we’re
only
talking
about
the
future
payments
and
here
we’re
again
on
this
question
of
reliance,
and
as
i
say,
i
don’t
think
that
there
could
be
any
genuine
element
of
surprise
here.
i
think
it’s
perhaps
interesting
in
connection
with
the
question
you
raised,
to
look
at
the
one
case
in
this
court
that
i
have
found
which
lies
in
this
stream
of
municipal
bond
cases.
norton
versus
shelby
county,
it’s
cited
in
both
of
the
briefs.
it
may
even
be
referred
to
in
the
opinion
below.
now,
what
that
case
is
usually
cited
for
is
some
rather
black
stony
in
language
about
the
absolute
retroactivity
of
judicial
decisions.
but
what
i’d
like
to
call
attention
to
is
the
facts
of
that
case.
contrary
to
the
other
bond
cases,
in
that
case
you
had
a
statute
passed
which
purported
to
transfer
certain
taxing
powers
from
one
political
body
to
another.
the
statute
was
challenged.
the
lower
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
statute.
in
the
time
intervening
between
the
trial
and
the
appeal,
bonds
were
issued.
on
the
appeal,
the
lower
court
was
reversed,
and
in
that
case
this
court
concluded
that
the
bonds
were
invalid.
that
goes
farther
than
what
we
have
to
do
here,
but
i
think
it’s
the
only
case
in
that
line
of
cases
where
you
find
that
sequence
of
events.
elsewhere,
the
case
always
was
that
there
had
been
consistent
judicial
interpretations
upholding
a
statute
by
the
highest
court
of
the
jurisdiction
involved.
subsequent
to
the
issuance
of
bonds,
there
is
a
reversal
of
that
precedent.
i
think
that’s
a
very
different
case
and
certainly
not
one
that
we
have
here.
we’re
much
closer
to
norton
versus
shelby
county.
when
you’re
done,
i
think,
looking
at
this
reliance
question
and
really
looking
at
it
not
just
taking
it
on
its
face,
i
think
the
record
indicates
that
there
are
no
genuinely
persuasive
reasons
for
departing
from
the
precedence
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
perspective
and
retrospective
application.
indeed
as
i
say
again,
in
a
literal
sense
a
prospective
application
of
the
ruling
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
will
give
the
plaintiffs
the
result
that
they
are
asking
for.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
no,
i
think
that
the
reliance
point
is
only
an
element
which
has
been
indicated
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
be
taken
into
account.
i
would
say
that
not
withstanding
the
reliance,
the
fact
that
there’s
more
entanglement
here
would
override
that.
and
for
that
reason
alone,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
deny
any
further
claimants.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
precisely.
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
only
that
i
think
that
in
this
case
to
grant
the
relief
of
the
defendants
have
sought
and
have
obtained
below,
would
carry
this
court
really
beyond
the
verge
of
violation
of
substantial
first
amendment
rights.
and
beyond
the
verge
of
the
previous
limitations
which
had
been
developed
with
respect
to
prospective
limitation.
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
case
provides
an
appropriate
bridge
for
this
court
to
travel
in
either
of
those
two
directions.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
if
the
inquiry
is,
would
this
fully
pay
for
the
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
it
is
my
presumption
your
honor,
that
it
is
less
than
that
in
fact
that
there
are
more
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
we
have
here
the
attorney
general,
the
commonwealth
i’m
sure
if
necessary
he
could
be
more
specific
on
that.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
well,
the
inquiry
seemed
to
me
to
be
quite
perjury.
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
looking
at
some
language
which
appeared
in
the
brochure
or
the
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
whatever
it
was,
an
inquiry
was
made.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’m
suggesting
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’m
suggesting,
your
honor
that
if
the
state
were
to
be
consistent
with
what
it
has
done
in
this
case,
it
would
have
to
do
that
and
that
if
the
same
standard
were
applied,
it
would
rule
out
all
the
schools.
and
there
you
are
right
in
to
the
morass.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
correct.
he
was
asked
to
convene
a
three-judge
court.
it
was
judge
troutman,
one
of
the
three
judges
in
the
court
below
here.
he
declined
to
convene
the
three-judge
court.
it’s
now
on
appeal
on
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
litigation
is
now
before
this
tribunal
for
the
second
time.
on
the
first
occasion,
this
court
ruled
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
that
pennsylvania
act
109
providing
aid
to
nonpublic
schools
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
under
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
the
case
has
returned
here
again
because
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
affect
and
purpose
of
that
prior
ruling,
and
the
question
which
is
now
presented
is
whether
the
commonwealth
can
now
disperse
an
additional
$24
million
approximately,
under
the
statute
which
has
been
held
unconstitutional
to
pennsylvania’s
sectarian
schools.
the
relevant
facts
i
think
are
these,
and
they
fall
into
two
categories,
first
with
respect
to
pennsylvania
act
109
itself.
that
statute
provided
a
scheme
for
subsidy
to
the
nonpublic
schools
in
the
form
of
reimbursement
for
certain
so
called
“secular
education
services”
as
defined
in
the
statute.
and
the
expenses
which
could
be
reimbursed
under
the
statute
included
the
cost
of
teacher
salaries,
textbooks,
and
instructional
materials
for
certain
specified
types
of
courses
of
instruction.
and
the
areas
of
instruction
which
were
included
were
mathematics,
modern
foreign
languages,
physical
sciences
and
physical
education.
the
schools
became
eligible
for
reimbursement
under
this
statute
by
entering
into
in
the
scheme
of
the
statute
certain
agreements,
purchase
of
service
contracts.
and
under
these
agreements
they
were
to
be
paid
by
the
state
in
the
subsequent
school
year
for
these
so
called
services
which
were
rendered
during
the
prior
year.
now,
it
was
not
of
course
necessary
for
any
school
to
show
that
it
had
in
fact
added
any
new
teachers,
admitted
any
new
pupils,
hired
any
new
textbooks
or
otherwise
really
incurred
any
new
expenses
in
order
to
receive
aid
under
the
statute.
all
it
was
required
that
it
was
the
school
satisfied
the
state
that
the
expenditures
in
question
fell
within
the
defined
statutory
categories
and,
this
is
a
very
vital
“and”
i
think,
that
the
services
for
which
reimbursement
was
sought
were
in
fact
secular,
and
did
not
include
any
subject
matter
expressing
religious
teaching
or
the
morals,
or
beliefs
of
any
particular
sect.
the
commonwealth
was
given
extensive
administrative
powers
in
carrying
out
the
purpose
of
this
statute
with
the
right
to
audit
the
performance
of
each
school
and
its
books
and
records
to
make
sure
that
the
expenditures
were
properly
made.
this
then,
in
brief
summary,
is
the
scheme
of
the
statute.
i’d
like
to
turn
now
to
the
chronology
of
events
here,
which
i
think
is
quite
significant.
the
statute
was
passed
in
june
of
1968,
and
within
one
month
the
plaintiffs
announced
publicly
and
this
was
in
the
news
media,
that
they
intended
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
this
act.
of
course,
the
suit
itself
could
not
be
brought
until
it
was
clear
that
the
statute
was
operational
that
in
fact
funds
were
going
to
be
disbursed
under
it,
otherwise
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
claim
could
be
dismissed
as
premature.
and
it
was
not
until
six
months
later,
at
the
end
of
1968
that
the
state
issued
rules
and
regulations
and
forms
and
so
forth
which
could
be
submitted
by
schools
seeking
subsidy
under
the
act.
now,
these
so
called
agreements
were
to
be
submitted
by
january
15th
of
1969
with
schedules
identifying
the
classes,
the
number
of
pupils
and
so
forth.
and
then
in
june,
at
the
end
of
the
school
year,
additional
schedules
were
to
be
submitted
which
detail
the
precise
items
of
expenditure
that
they
were
seeking
reimbursement
for.
once
it
was
clear
that
the
statute
was
indeed
operational,
plaintiffs
filed
suit.
now,
this
was
in
july
of
1969.
at
that
time
the
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
and
i
may
say
to
the
considerable
surprise
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
district
court
panel
in
a
2-1
decision
over
the
dissent
of
chief
justice
--
chief
judge
hastie
granted
that
motion
to
dismiss.
plaintiffs
immediately
appealed
to
this
court.
within
six
weeks,
after
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
schools
again
entered
into
these
contracts
which
are
annual
in
nature
on
the
15th
of
january
1970,
and
it’s
at
this
point,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
correct
a
factual
error
which
is
in
the
record
and
it
has
been
in
the
record
i’m
afraid
from
the
time
this
case
was
presented
to
the
district
court
on
remand.
and
i
think
that
mr.
ball
and
i
are
in
agreement
that
we
can
now
stipulate
to
this
change.
and
the
change
is
this,
it
was
stated
below
by
the
defendants
that
on
january
15,
1970
the
schools
entered
into
contracts
for
services
to
be
rendered
in
the
subsequent
school
year
1970
to
1971.
we
have
repeated
that
statement
in
the
briefs
that
we
have
filed
here.
that
is
not
correct.
the
contracts
that
were
signed
on
the
15th
of
january
1970
were
applicable
to
services
provided
in
that
school
year
that
was
already
half
over
1969-1970.
and
it
was
therefore
not
until
a
year
later,
january
15,
1971
that
agreements
were
entered
into
by
the
schools
covering
services
for
the
1970-1971
school
year.
there
is
a
one
year
difference
there,
and
although
i
frankly
don’t
believe
that
it’s
critical
to
the
plaintiffs’
case
here,
i
think
it
does
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
arguments
of
the
defendants
have
made
as
i
come
to
in
a
minute.
the
facts
that
these
agreements
were
not
signed
until
the
15th
of
january
1971,
means
that
a
number
of
other
intervening
events
have
occurred.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’m
now
referring
to
agreements
covering
the
1970-1971
school
year
that
is
the
year
and
the
only
year
which
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
right,
halfway
through
that
year.
the
state
has
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
yes,
september
1,
i
think
is
essentially
the
beginning.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
correct.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that.
the
funds
that
the
commonwealth
collected
for
those
years
have
already
been
disbursed
to
the
schools,
and
the
plaintiffs
are
not
here
seeking
a
return
of
any
moneys
which
have
already
been
paid
out.
we
are
seeking
only
an
order
which
would
bar
any
further
payment
of
funds
which
the
commonwealth
still
has.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i
do
not
have
that
figure.
i
believe
it
was
something
less
than
the
sum
that
we
now
have
here.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
about
$24
or
$25
million
approximately.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
it
is
the
date
which
was
established
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
schedule
which
was
put
out
by
the
state
itself
with
its
rules
and
regulations
when
they
were
issued
under
the
statute.
what
they
did
was
set
a
specific
schedule
for
the
1968-1969
year
and
then
said
it’s
the
same
schedule
every
year
thereafter
year
after
year.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i
do
not
believe
at
this
time
that
there
is,
your
honor.
i
think
we’re
now
focusing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
impact
of
this
court’s
decision
in
june
of
1971,
whatever
the
situation
may
have
been
before
that,
whether
the
impact
of
this
court’s
decision
in
june
of
1971
was
to
prevent
any
further
disbursements
under
the
unconstitutional
statute
thereafter.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
it
would
have
been
against
the
disbursements.
that
is
of
course
the
ultimate
nexus
the
focus
of
the
case.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
constitutionally
i
would
say
yes,
because
i
think
that
there
is
at
least
since
the
tidal
oil
case
in
1924.
it
is
clear
that
a
judicial
decision
nullifying
a
statute
can
have
full
retroactive
operation.
we
do
not
urge
it.
we
do
not
urge
it
here
and
whether
on
a
less
than
constitutional
plan
as
a
matter
of
policy,
this
court
would
determine
if
it
were
presented
that
question
that
it
was
appropriate
to
apply
the
decision
that
retroactively.
i
think
is
a
different
matter
and
one
that
[voice
overlap].
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i
think
in
that
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
yes,
i
think
i
have
reference
to
the
standards
which
have
been
suggested
in
linkletter
and
certain
other
cases
in
which
it’s
been
indicated
that
when
one
is
considering
retroactive
application,
one
ought
to
look
at
the
substance
of
the
rule
which
is
laid
down,
and
determine
whether
the
policy
that
lies
behind
that
rule
will
be
offended
or
not
if
only
a
prospective
application
is
given.
i
think
you’d
have
to
look
at
the
question
of
whether
you
would
be
really
remedying
or
preserving
the
integrity,
if
you
will,
of
the
rationale
behind
this
court’s
decision
in
lemon
by
ordering
a
return
of
those
prior
funds.
i
suggest
that
there
is
a
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
case
at
bar.
and
the
difference
is
this.
this
court,
i
think,
focused
principally
in
its
decision
which
came
down
in
june
of
1971,
holding
that
act
109
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
on
the
question
of
entanglement.
i
think
there
are
other
threads
that
can
be
discerned
in
the
fabric
of
the
opinions
of
the
court,
but
i
think
this
is
we’ll
assume
for
the
moment
the
primary
one.
and
as
to
entanglement,
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendants
here
that
all
the
entanglement
that
there
might
be
under
this
statute
has
already
occurred
with
respect
to
1970-1971.
in
effect,
the
horse
has
been
stolen,
there’s
no
point
in
locking
the
barn
now.
this
contention,
the
plaintiffs
disagree
with
vigorously.
we
say
that
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record.
in
fact,
there
is
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
there
has
been
the
kind
of
discriminating
meaningful
inquiry
by
the
commonwealth
into
the
applications
which
have
been
submitted
by
over
a
thousand
schools,
most
of
them
sectarian,
to
insure
that
these
funds
would
not
be
used
in
fact
for
the
furtherance
of
religious
purposes
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
and
not
only
is
there
no
evidence
in
the
record
whatsoever
to
support
the
position
of
the
defendants
on
this
point.
they
asked
simply
that
you
conclusively
presume
that
all
this
has
been
done.
i
think
there
is
now
evidence,
and
we’ve
referred
to
it
in
our
supplemental
brief
filed
only
last
week
that
indicates
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
the
commonwealth
has
advised
one
of
the
named
defendant
schools
in
this
very
litigation.
the
montgomery
--
philadelphia
montgomery
christian
academy
and
certain
other
schools
that
they
are
not
eligible
for
any
aid
under
act
109,
whatever
remaining
aid
there
may
be
under
it.
because
in
the
by-laws
or
a
charter
of
the
institution,
there
is
reference
made
to
the
fact
that
the
god’s
creation
has
a
bearing
on
the
teaching
practices
of
that
institution.
and
i
think
my
witty
opponent
mr.
ball,
would
be
the
first
one
to
concede
that
the
application
of
that
kind
of
administrative
standard
in
making
these
determinations
if
applied
to
all
of
the
schools
in
the
state
would
disqualify
every
catholic
parochial
school
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
about
that.
the
montgomery
academy
confronted
with
this
decision
brought
suit
against
the
commonwealth
in
the
federal
district
court
seeking
to
have
a
reversal.
they
were
told
not
surprisingly
at
that
point,
this
occurring
after
the
decision
of
this
court
striking
down
act
109,
they
were
told
that
they
could
not
have
a
hearing
to
review
the
administrative
determination
made
by
the
state
because
that
would
create
the
very
entanglement
which
this
court
has
said
is
forbidden
by
the
religion
clauses.
and
so
you
have
a
conundrum,
you
have
an
apparently
arbitrary
decision
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
there
are
two
years
in
question
in
that
case.
one
of
them
is
1970-1971,
one
of
them
is
1969
and
1970,
in
which
is
also
interesting
and
i’ll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
therefore,
i
submit
that
the
evidence
is
that
there
has
not
been
the
kind
of
discriminating
inquiry
that
the
really
terribly
difficult
question
of
looking
into
the
classroom,
and
that’s
what
it
came
down
to
in
this
case.
to
determine
whether
in
fact
these
expenditures
would
be
for
secular
purposes.
and
therefore,
i
suggest
that
to
permit
the
disbursement
of
the
$24
million
now
would
run
directly
afoul
of
the
rationale
of
this
court’s
decision
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman.
unless
of
course
you
simply
say,
“pay
the
money
out
without
any
further
inquiry.”
and
that
i
think
would
run
afoul
of
this
court’s
decision
because
it
would
be
done
without
any
insurance
that
you
weren’t
directly
violating
the
establishment
clause.
now,
turn
to
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
i’ve
been
speaking
now
out
in
terms
of
the
rationale
of
this
court’s
prior
ruling
in
whether
it
would
be
offended.
looking
now
to
the
other
side,
are
there
any
interests
here
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
schools
which
would
warrant
an
exception
to
what
i
submit
is
the
usual
effect
given
to
a
judicial
decision?
and
as
to
whether
it
is
the
usual
effect
without
getting
in
to
the
nice
philosophical
distinctions
between
the
blackstonian
approach
and
the
brooding
omnipresence
in
the
sky
and
so
forth,
and
the
more
contemporary
realistic
approach.
i
do
think
it’s
clear
that
it
has
long
been
recognized
and
for
good
reason
that
judicial
rulemaking
is
essentially
retroactive,
unless
there
is
good
reason
to
make
exception
to
that.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
constitutional
rulings
primarily
although
i
think
one
can
find
precedence
which
address
the
same
problem
even
in
other
areas
of
which
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
surely,
injunctions
by
their
very
nature
or
not,
yes.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
principally.
i
don’t
think
i
have
to
address
other
areas.
for
example,
without
getting
into
it,
there
are
areas
i
suppose
open
to
question
when
a
court
interprets
a
statute
in
one
way
and
then
reverses
itself
in
another
case
in
some
time
later
and
interprets
the
statute
in
another
way.
there
are
questions
there
whether
that
is
a
retroactive,
if
you
will,
interpretation
of
the
statute.
usually,
i
think
it’s
held
that
it
is.
although
there
maybe
some
exceptional
cases.
but
certainly,
in
the
area
of
constitutional
adjudication,
i
think
the
general
rule
is
that
it
is
retroactive
unless
there
is
sound
reason
to
depart
from
that,
and
the
two
principal
areas
of
exception
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief.
of
course
the
bond
cases
where
you
have
public
bonds
being
issued
in
reliance
on
the
validity
of
the
procedures
involved,
and
then
those
procedures
are
struck
down.
this
court
has,
on
many
occasions,
expressed
reluctance
and
unwillingness
to
hold
that
those
bonds
now
in
the
hands
of
innocent
holders
are
void,
and
that
the
money
that
has
been
paid
for,
that
is
simply
to
be
forfeited.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
this
is
exactly
what
i’m
coming
to.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
so-called
agreements,
i
think
there’re
several
points
to
be
made
here.
with
regard
to
the
so-called
agreements
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
well,
i
think
there’s
a
real
question,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
these
agreements
are
true
contracts
in
the
sense
of
a
quid
pro
quo
between
the
commonwealth
and
the
schools.
the
schools
don’t
have
to
show
that
they
are
really
hiring
any
new
teachers,
adding
any
new
pupils,
incurring
any
new
expenditure
in
order
to
be
reimbursed.
essentially
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
they’re
really
being
subsidized
for
doing
what
they
would
be
doing
anyway.
now,
i
know
that
defendants
have
cited
cases
which
indicate
that,
at
least
in
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
a
very
technical
approach
to
aspects
of
consideration
can
be
taken
and
you
can
say
there
are
valid
contracts
under
contract
law.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
perhaps.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
right.
perhaps
there
is
an
ultimate
quid
pro
quo.
i
think
it
depends
in
this
sense
on
whether
the,
i
call
them
in
terrorem.
i
think
kind
of
arguments
that
are
made
here
are
true.
that
is
that
without
the
subsidy,
you
will
have
widespread
closing
of
the
private
school
system
and
that
otherwise
this
great
burden
will
fall
upon
the
public
school
system.
i
suggest
that
the
record
doesn’t
really
indicate
that
that’s
the
fact.
it’s
not
the
parochial
schools
who
didn’t
open
this
fall
for
lack
of
funds
in
philadelphia.
it’s
the
public
school
system
that
didn’t
have
the
money
to
pay
its
teachers
and
its
two-and-a-half
weeks
late.
it’s
the
public
schools
who
may
have
to
close
early
next
spring.
but
in
that
ultimate
sense
if
that
were
ultimately
shown
to
be
the
case,
i
guess
it
could
be
said
yes,
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo.
i
suggest
it
need
not
be
assumed
to
be
true
at
this
point,
and
in
respect
of
the
particular
years
involved,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
the
schools
would
have
incurred
these
expenses
anyway.
secondly,
you
have
a
fact
that
the
commonwealth
itself
has
regarded
this
statutory
scheme
as
essentially
a
subsidy.
again,
i
point
to
the
case
referred
to
in
our
supplemental
brief.
the
philadelphia
montgomery
christian
academy
was
told
by
the
commonwealth
in
july
of
1970
that
it
would
receive
no
payments
in
respect
of
services
provided
during
the
preceding
school
year,
1969-1970.
and
interestingly
enough
the
district
court
never
faced
that
question
when
it
dismissed
the
academy’s
complaint.
the
commonwealth
didn’t
talk
about
contractual
reliance
there,
equitable
obligations,
contractual
obligations.
they
treated
it
as
a
subsidy
which
could
and
should
be
cut
off
at
any
time
the
state
decided
that
it
was
improper.
and
this
is
precisely
the
position
that
we’re
taking.
i
think
the
actions
of
the
commonwealth
confirm
it.
third,
the
fact
is
that
because
the
contracts
were
not
entered
into
for
the
year
in
question
until
january
15,
1971,
the
schools
had
already
incurred
whatever
expenses
there
were
in
teaching
the
subjects
they
were
halfway
through
the
school
year,
and
the
single
most
important
sentence
i
think
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
justified
the
decision
below
is
this,
and
i’m
quoting
from
our
jurisdictional
statement
page
9
of
the
appendix.
“in
reliance
on
these
contracts
--“
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’m
sorry.
it’s
the
appendix
your
honor,
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
--
rather
than
the
appendix
itself.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
page
9
of
the
appendix
which
is
toward
the
rear.
the
bottom
paragraph
on
that
page
the
court
said
“in
reliance
on
these
contracts”
and
it
used
the
word
contracts
in
quotes
because
it
wasn’t
deciding
whether
they
were
really
contracts
or
not,
“the
nonpublic
schools
adjusted
their
budgets
accordingly
and
performed
the
services
required
by
them.”
my
proposition
is
how
can
you
rely
on
contracts
that
haven’t
even
been
entered
into?
and
i
think,
i
can
only
assume
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
court
below
had
in
mind
that
these
contracts
had
been
signed
on
january
15,
1970
not
january
15,
1971.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
you’ve
anticipated
my
next
point
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
that
is
the
next
dimension
of
the
argument
that
the
defendants
are
making
that
they
thought
the
statute
was
constitutional.
they
say
they
assumed
it
was
going
to
continue
to
be
so
and
that
therefore
they
could
continue
to
rely
on
this
subsidy
which
they
had
had
in
prior
years.
and
i
think
there,
it’s
relevant
to
look
at
the
question
of
what
really
were
the
expectations
of
the
parties
here.
this
is
not,
as
we
had
made
clear,
a
case
of
an
overruling
of
prior
precedent.
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
statute
was
passed
and
from
the
very
beginning,
every
party
involved
would
it
recognized
that
its
constitutionality
was
open
to
serious
question.
everyone
knew
it
was
going
to
be
taken
to
the
courts
and
that
ultimately
this
court
was
going
to
have
to
decide
the
issue.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
the
first
decision,
i’m
not
sure
i
know
which
decision
you’re
referring
to.
the
first
decision
in
the
district
court
was
in
november
of
1969.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
and
that
was
to
the
effect
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
they
dismissed
the
complaint.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
the
second
decision
was
not
rendered
until
after
remand
from
this
court,
which
was
in
i
think
november
of
1971.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
correct.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that
--
it
is
correct.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
dicenso
case
came
down
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
june
of
1970
before
the
school
year
in
question
here
eight
months
before
the
contracts
were
signed,
unanimously
striking
down
a
very
similar
statute
concerning
salary
supplements.
this
court’s
decision
in
walz
versus
commissioner
which
to
be
sure
held
that
tax
deductions
for
religious
contributions
were
appropriate,
the
rationale
of
that
decision
certainly
prefigured
the
ultimate
result
in
this
case.
and
narrow
really
the
area
of
permissible
involvement
i
think
between
church
and
state
and
focused
on
the
problem
of
entanglement.
all
of
these
things
were
intervening.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’ll
be
happy
to.
let
me
start
first
with
the
argument
that
the
defendants
have
made.
they
have
said
in
effect
that
in
the
absence
of
any
proof,
it
falls
on
the
plaintiff
and
that
you
must
presume
that
everything
has
been
done
and
that
there
is
full
reliance
here.
perhaps
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i’ve
misanticipated
the
direction
of
your
question.
i
was
going
to
focus
on
whether
the
plaintiffs
or
the
defendants
had
to
show
that
all
had
been
done
by
the
state
that’s
necessary
to
be
done.
but
perhaps
your
question
was
directed
to
different
point.
i
want
to
be
sure
on
response.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
well,
they’ve
cited
the
allen
case
for
the
proposition
that
on
this
kind
of
record
it
must
be
presumed
that
the
state
has
been
doing
everything
right,
and
that
at
this
point,
this
money
can
be
distributed.
and
i
only
want
to
distinguish
what
this
court
did
in
allen
from
what
this
court
did
in
this
case
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman,
where
it
specifically
declined
to
assume
on
a
basis
of
a
bare
bones
record
that
there
could
be
no
entanglement
here.
allen
was
dealing
with
textbooks.
the
judgment
there
was
that
you
can’t
assume
that
the
state
isn’t
able
to
choose
the
right
kind
of
textbooks
in
approving
textbooks
for
the
parochial
schools.
in
this
case
where
you
have
teacher
salaries
involved
and
so
forth,
the
presumption
was
to
the
contrary
that
there
would
have
to
be
entanglement,
so
that
i’m
saying
that
i
don’t
think
the
defendant’s
citation
of
allen
is
well
founded
on
this
point.
plus
the
fact
that
i
say
the
record
does
have
positive
evidence
indicating
that
the
state
is
not
doing
what
it
would
have
to
do
really
to
take
care
of
its
constitutional
obligations
here.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that
is
certainly
often
done.
i
can
only
say
here,
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
expense
to
the
plaintiffs
would
have
been
in
seeking
such
a
stay,
or
any
kind
of
an
injunction.
they
would’ve
been
holding
up
funds
and
they
decided
not
to
hold
up
those
funds,
and
as
i
say
again
we’re
not
seeking
now
to
undo
those
payments.
the
payments
that
were
made
during
the
period
between
trial
and
appeal
had
been,
and
we’re
not
asking
to
reverse
them.
we’re
only
talking
about
the
future
payments
and
here
we’re
again
on
this
question
of
reliance,
and
as
i
say,
i
don’t
think
that
there
could
be
any
genuine
element
of
surprise
here.
i
think
it’s
perhaps
interesting
in
connection
with
the
question
you
raised,
to
look
at
the
one
case
in
this
court
that
i
have
found
which
lies
in
this
stream
of
municipal
bond
cases.
norton
versus
shelby
county,
it’s
cited
in
both
of
the
briefs.
it
may
even
be
referred
to
in
the
opinion
below.
now,
what
that
case
is
usually
cited
for
is
some
rather
black
stony
in
language
about
the
absolute
retroactivity
of
judicial
decisions.
but
what
i’d
like
to
call
attention
to
is
the
facts
of
that
case.
contrary
to
the
other
bond
cases,
in
that
case
you
had
a
statute
passed
which
purported
to
transfer
certain
taxing
powers
from
one
political
body
to
another.
the
statute
was
challenged.
the
lower
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
statute.
in
the
time
intervening
between
the
trial
and
the
appeal,
bonds
were
issued.
on
the
appeal,
the
lower
court
was
reversed,
and
in
that
case
this
court
concluded
that
the
bonds
were
invalid.
that
goes
farther
than
what
we
have
to
do
here,
but
i
think
it’s
the
only
case
in
that
line
of
cases
where
you
find
that
sequence
of
events.
elsewhere,
the
case
always
was
that
there
had
been
consistent
judicial
interpretations
upholding
a
statute
by
the
highest
court
of
the
jurisdiction
involved.
subsequent
to
the
issuance
of
bonds,
there
is
a
reversal
of
that
precedent.
i
think
that’s
a
very
different
case
and
certainly
not
one
that
we
have
here.
we’re
much
closer
to
norton
versus
shelby
county.
when
you’re
done,
i
think,
looking
at
this
reliance
question
and
really
looking
at
it
not
just
taking
it
on
its
face,
i
think
the
record
indicates
that
there
are
no
genuinely
persuasive
reasons
for
departing
from
the
precedence
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
perspective
and
retrospective
application.
indeed
as
i
say
again,
in
a
literal
sense
a
prospective
application
of
the
ruling
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
will
give
the
plaintiffs
the
result
that
they
are
asking
for.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
no,
i
think
that
the
reliance
point
is
only
an
element
which
has
been
indicated
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
be
taken
into
account.
i
would
say
that
not
withstanding
the
reliance,
the
fact
that
there’s
more
entanglement
here
would
override
that.
and
for
that
reason
alone,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
deny
any
further
claimants.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
precisely.
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
only
that
i
think
that
in
this
case
to
grant
the
relief
of
the
defendants
have
sought
and
have
obtained
below,
would
carry
this
court
really
beyond
the
verge
of
violation
of
substantial
first
amendment
rights.
and
beyond
the
verge
of
the
previous
limitations
which
had
been
developed
with
respect
to
prospective
limitation.
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
case
provides
an
appropriate
bridge
for
this
court
to
travel
in
either
of
those
two
directions.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
if
the
inquiry
is,
would
this
fully
pay
for
the
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
it
is
my
presumption
your
honor,
that
it
is
less
than
that
in
fact
that
there
are
more
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
we
have
here
the
attorney
general,
the
commonwealth
i’m
sure
if
necessary
he
could
be
more
specific
on
that.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
well,
the
inquiry
seemed
to
me
to
be
quite
perjury.
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
looking
at
some
language
which
appeared
in
the
brochure
or
the
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
whatever
it
was,
an
inquiry
was
made.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’m
suggesting
--
mr.
david
p.
bruton
i’m
suggesting,
your
honor
that
if
the
state
were
to
be
consistent
with
what
it
has
done
in
this
case,
it
would
have
to
do
that
and
that
if
the
same
standard
were
applied,
it
would
rule
out
all
the
schools.
and
there
you
are
right
in
to
the
morass.
mr.
david
p.
bruton
that’s
correct.
he
was
asked
to
convene
a
three-judge
court.
it
was
judge
troutman,
one
of
the
three
judges
in
the
court
below
here.
he
declined
to
convene
the
three-judge
court.
it’s
now
on
appeal
on
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
