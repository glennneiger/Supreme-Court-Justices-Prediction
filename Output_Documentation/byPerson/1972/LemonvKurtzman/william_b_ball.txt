mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
arguing
here
today
not
only
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
schools
who
are
named
in
the
complaint,
lemon
versus
kurtzman,
but
also
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
who
is
represented
here
today
by
the
attorney
general
who
sits
next
to
me
at
counsel
table.
and
on
behalf
of
the
intervenor
defendant
of
pennsylvania
association
of
independent
schools,
whose
counsel
a
distinguished
philadelphia
--
a
member
of
the
philadelphia
bar
mr.
henry
t.
reath
is
here,
and
who
has
presented
a
brief
in
this
case.
the
appellants
agree
with
the
commonwealth,
with
the
schools,
with
the
intervenor
defendant
and
with
the
court
below
that
a
decree
of
unconstitutionality
does
not
necessarily
have,
in
all
cases,
a
retrospective
effect.
rather,
the
answer
to
whether
it
does
or
does
not
would
depend
in
part
upon
considerations
of
the
interests
of
justice
and
it
will
depend
also
upon
whether
the
constitutional
policy
which
was
expressed
in
the
decree
will
be
frustrated
if
the
application
is
made
only
prospectively.
the
appellants
on
the
first
point
have
said
there
was
really
no
interest
of
justice
involved,
so
far
as
the
schools
are
concerned,
and
they
have
said
secondly,
that
the
very
crisis
of
which
the
court
attract
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
will
be
perpetuated
should
the
court
hold
and
agree
with
the
unanimous
court
below
that
this
statute
should
be,
that
its
decree
should
be
applied
only
prospectively.
and
as
these
two
points
namely,
the
question
of
the
interest
of
justice,
the
question
of
the
constitutional
policy
that
i
will
address
myself
to
in
this
argument.
now,
we
speak
of
the
interest
of
justice,
i
think
your
honors
that
we
have
to
focus
first
of
all
on
the
holders
of
that
interest.
and
in
this
case,
they
are
school
people,
they
are
educators,
they
are
people
who
are
working
with
parents
and
with
children
in
pennsylvania.
in
the
real
life
business
of
being
locked
in
a
struggle
against
inflation
and
taxation
in
educating
23%
of
the
population
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
school
population
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
some
535,000
children.
children
who
are
being
educated
in
schools
in
the
inner
city
of
philadelphia,
in
the
large
population
centers
of
pittsburgh
and
scranton,
and
erie,
and
who
are
also
found
in
the
coal
regions
and
the
rural
regions
of
that
state.
as
we
look
at
these
holders
of
this
interest
then
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
whether
they
were
in
good
faith,
whether
they
were
justified
and
reasonably
relying
upon
the
continuing
validity
of
this
act
which
was
passed
by
the
legislature.
whether
indeed
there
were
actual
real
legal
contracts
which
they
had
entered
upon,
and
whether
they
are
going
to
suffer
hardship
if
the
1970-1971
claimants
which
they
have
earned
are
not
to
denied
them.
i
too
feel
that
the
chronology
of
events
becomes
important
in
understanding
this
case.
as
counsel
has
stated,
the
act
was
passed
in
june
of
1968.
immediately
thereafter,
the
commonwealth
department
of
education
tooled
up
to
put
the
act
into
full
operation.
that
began
to
occur
immediately
upon
the
passage
of
the
act,
and
by
the
fall,
time
of
the
opening
of
the
school
year
an
office
to
administer
this
act
had
been
set
up
and
paid
employees
of
that
office
appointed,
and
their
work
had
begun.
indeed,
counsel
speaks
of
the
regulations
which
counsel’s
briefs
tells
us
appeared
in
december
of
that
year.
these
were
created
in
the
fall
of
that
year.
thus,
the
fact
that
a
challenge
to
this
act
had
been
announced
in
the
press
immediately
upon
the
passage
of
the
act,
but
no
suit
brought
certainly
gave
the
administrators
of
the
schools
reasonable
reliance,
at
least
a
measure
of
it
that
the
act
was
going
to
remain
unchallenged.
the
plaintiffs
had
every
opportunity
to
bring
an
injunction
action
that
very
fall
because
money
was
committed
to
the
program
and
that
program
was
in
on
operation
at
this
time,
they
neglected
to
do
so.
mr.
william
b.
ball
in
june
of
1968,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that’s
correct.
and
there
was
full
opportunity
for
the
plaintiffs
to
have
brought
their
suit.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
action
was
brought
june
3,
1969.
mr.
william
b.
ball
almost
a
year.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
correct
as
counsel
in
his
statement
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
the
group
that
announced
that
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
a
spokesman
for
an
organization
known
as
americans
united
and
the
speech
given
at
pittsburgh.
counsel
has
said
and
admitted
in
his
argument
today
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
plural
did
announce
this
at
this
time.
thus,
this
was
apparently
with
the
concurrence
of
those
who
ultimately
did
become
all
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
now
then,
contracts
were
entered
into
january
15,
1969.
why
the
delay
if
this
was
a
true
contractual
situation?
in
this
governmental
program
as
in
many
similar
programs,
say
if
the
federal
government,
sometimes
legislation
is
passed
putting
a
program
into
effect.
then
the
people
who
are
going
to
participate
in
the
program
enter
into
application
relationships
in
anticipation
of
entering
contracts
under
the
program,
and
they
then
go
ahead
and
execute
the
contract
at
some
later
date.
and
this
is
how
that
january
15
date
gets
locked
in
to
the
annual
renewal
of
the
program.
1181
schools
entered
into
contracts
with
the
commonwealth,
and
i
should
like
to
pause
here
briefly
to
cover
a
point
that
i
don’t
think
is
essential
for
our
case,
though
i
think
it
does
add
to
the
interest
of
justice
the
equity
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
appropriations
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
would
not
become
available
till
the
following
september.
in
other
words,
the
first
payment
these
are
payments
by
reimbursement
in
a
typical
purchase
and
service
situation,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
first
payment
would
be
made
for
the
1968-1969
school
year.
the
first
payment
would
be
made
in
september
1969.
payments
were
always
after
the
fact.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
passing
word
about
contracts
because
we
do
not
think
that
the
existence
of
a
contract
is
essential
to
our
case
though
we
believe
it
adds
to
the
equities
of
our
case.
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
in
its
original
decision
upholding
the
act,
310
federal
supplement
at
page
40
called
these
contracts.
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
the
pennsylvania
law
which
is
applicable
to
these
agreements
and
which
clearly
demonstrates
their
contracts.
if
these
are
not
contracts,
then
the
purchase
of
service
contract
which
typifies
all
sorts
of
arrangements
between
states
and
sectarian
institutions
of
welfare
and
health,
and
care
of
the
aged,
childcare
and
so
on,
are
certainly
not
contracts
though
they
have
been
upheld
as
contracts
in
case
after
case.
among
these
the
leading
pennsylvania
case
on
purchase
of
service
from
sectarian
child
caring
institutions,
shade
versus
allegheny
county
institution
district
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
under
these
contracts
and
under
the
arrangement,
under
the
service
which
took
place
in
pursuant
to
the
act.
first
of
all,
it
was
necessary
that
the
sectarian
schools
replaced
any
religiously
oriented
textbooks
which
they
might
have
in
the
four
subjects
covered
by
the
act
with
books
which
had
to
have
the
prior
approval
of
the
state
secretary
of
education
as
provided
in
the
act
and
the
regulations.
furthermore,
they
had
to
conform
their
teaching
plans
to
the
severe
secularity
requirements
of
the
act,
so
that
in
the
teaching
of
these
four
subjects,
those
requirements
would
be
observed.
they
also
had
to
setup
separate
accounting
systems
according
to
one
provision
of
the
act,
whereby
they
had
to
keep
separate
accounts
related
to
these
four
subjects.
they
made
administrative
changes
obviously
in
the
areas
pertaining
to
teacher
certification
requirements
under
the
act,
and
also
with
respect
to
standardized
testing
which
came
as
a
new
requirement
to
many
of
the
schools
and
was
aimed
in
improving
quality.
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
made
note
of
the
fact
that
the
very
purpose
of
this
program
was
to
enhance,
and
this
court
found
was
to
enhance
the
quality
of
education
in
the
schools
which
were
served
under
the
act.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no
indeed.
and
the
fact
that
the
schools
now
did
in
some
cases
what
they
had
been
doing
before
now
being
funded
for
it,
present
us
a
picture
very,
very
similar
to
what
happens
under
medicaid,
to
what
happens
under
other
kinds
of
purchase
of
service
agreements.
that
is
to
say
the
state
enters
into
a
contract
with
let
us
say
a
sectarian
child
caring
institution.
it
does
so,
and
this
brings
us
back
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger
this
morning.
it
does
so
because
it
has
a
public
need.
the
state
has
a
need
for
that
service.
it
needs
to
have
someone
take
care
let’s
say
of
dependent
and
neglected
children.
so
it
goes
to
a
sectarian
institution,
child
caring
institution,
and
pays
it
to
carry
on
this
publicly
needed
service.
the
institution
itself
does
nothing
more
than
it
did
before,
but
it
is
now
aided
materially
in
the
rendering
of
that
service,
and
indeed
it
may
improve
the
services.
we
happen
to
know
that
in
pennsylvania,
what
this
act
meant
was
that
a
school
which
had
a
class
let’s
say
of
70
children
in
a
math
class
could
now
split
that
into
two
or
three
sections.
a
school
which
had
not
been
able
to
afford
to
have
a
calculus
course
could
now
hire
a
calculus
teacher.
a
school
which
had
not
previously
had
a
course
in
spanish
could
now
institute
a
course
in
spanish.
mr.
william
b.
ball
or
indeed
it
did,
yes.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
finally,
the
act
itself
four
times
uses
the
term
contract,
which
i
think
is
significant
in
terms
of
pennsylvania’s
legislation
knowing
pennsylvania’s
law
and
knowing
what
it
was
doing
pursuant
to
that
law.
then
in
june
3,
1969
the
plaintiffs
instituted
their
case.
the
program
goes
into
its
second
year.
and
in
november
28,
1969
the
very
form
selected
by
the
plaintiffs,
three-judge
federal
court
of
philadelphia,
upholds
the
act
as
being
constitutional.
i
could
scarcely
think
of
a
greater
incentive
to
the
schools
to
continue
to
serve
under
this
act.
as
to
the
commonwealth,
the
commonwealth
had
no
need
to
have
a
reliance
upon
the
act.
the
commonwealth
was
bound
by
the
act,
bound
by
the
law
of
pennsylvania
to
continue
the
program.
thereafter,
in
may
15,
1970
the
decision
of
this
court
in
walz
versus
the
tax
commission
takes
place.
there
was
some
comment
during
mr.
bruton’s
argument
with
respect
to
the
walz
case.
this
seemed
to
us
as
turnings
of
this
decision.
first
of
all
to
uphold
direct
aid
to
religion,
this
was
the
fact
of
the
case,
the
most
essential
part
of
it.
it
did
nothing
to
disturb
the
purpose
and
effect
test
in
allen,
and
allen’s
careful
demarcation
of
the
secular
function
which
was
found
to
be
supportable
by
the
public
in
that
case.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that’s
perfectly
true
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
the
fact
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that,
but
on
balance
as
we
read
that
opinion,
we
felt
that
it
did
not
disturb
and
could
not
have
disturbed
what
was
already
determined
by
the
court
in
board
of
education
versus
allen,
where
we
have
a
clear
support
with
public
funds
of
the
secular
function
clearly
spelled
out
by
the
court
which
takes
place
or
is
offered
in
sectarian
schools.
we
were
also
encouraged
by
the
fact
that
there
was
extensive
italicizing
by
the
chief
justice
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
of
a
number
of
passages
from
cases
in
which
the
aid
which
had
been
given
to
sectarian
education
as
for
example
in
allen
was
heavily
stressed.
again,
we
have
the
authority
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
walz
case
who
all
but
predicted
that
the
walz
decision
lead
directly
to
support
of
aid
to
parochial
schools.
again
we
found
no
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
indeed
was
a
dissent,
but
a
very
authoritative
dissent,
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
william
b.
ball
we
also
examined
the
concept
of
entanglement
in
terms
of,
or
in
comparison
to
the
extensive
regulation
of
nonpublic
schools
which
this
court
had
pointed
to
in
board
of
education
versus
allen.
we
did
not
think
that
the
provisions
with
respect
to
secularity,
with
respect
to
church
school
or
state
school
relationships
contained
in
act
109
added
a
feathers
weight
to
the
kind
of
relationship
which
was
already
considered
licit
in
the
law
and
which
had
been
recognized
by
this
court.
the
school
administrators
both
sectarian
and
nonsectarian
had
no
complaint
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
this
act.
conceivably
there
would
be
sense
to
it,
and
again
we
saw
no
degree
of
relationship
such
as
is
observed
in
purchase
of
service
arrangements
in
the
welfare
and
healthcare
fields.
and
thus,
we
think
that
the
situation
as
we
came
in
to
the
1970-1971
school
year
was
one
in
which
this
act
had
been
upheld
by
a
court
chosen
by
the
plaintiffs.
we
thought
this
act
basically
did
not
confront
the
decision
of
the
court
in
walz
and
therefore,
we
think
it
was
a
complete
basis
for
a
lawyer’s
reliance
in
proceeding
with
the
contracts
for
the
coming
year.
but
we
are
talking
here
not
about
a
lawyer’s
reliance,
but
educator’s
reliance,
people
who
are
in
the
job
of
educating
and
whose
schools
desperately
needed
the
funding
in
question.
those
people
and
the
parents
who
are
the
basic
source
of
support
of
the
schools
in
question,
and
they
certainly
could
not
have
desisted
from
the
program
in
accordance
with
the
ethical
obligation
which
they
have
to
their
constituents.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
were
indeed
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
stress
is
this,
that
if
we’re
talking
here
about
the
good
faith
reliance,
i
think
that
we
do
not
and
cannot
impose
upon
either
the
turnings
for
the
schools,
the
duties
of
predicting
where
this
court
would’ve
gone
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
the
test
case.
i
think
in
the
second
place,
the
educators,
the
people
who
are
operating
schools
and
the
parents
will
certainly
bond
to
continue
the
program,
and
having
before
them
--
having
before
them
not
a
decision
of
this
court
striking
down
such
a
program,
but
having
before
them
a
decision
of
the
district
court
upholding
the
program.
i
couldn’t
imagine
better
basis
for
reliance
and
good
faith
reliance.
the
decision
came
down
finally
june
28,
1971.
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court,
the
supreme
court
not
attempting
to
spell
out
to
rule
upon
the
effect
of
its
this
decision
in
kurtzman.
the
court
below,
after
full
briefing
an
argument
unanimously,
this
time
including
judge
hastie,
held
that
the
effect
of
this
decree
should
be
prospective
only,
and
pointed
to
the
elements,
reliance
and
hardship
which
we’ve
been
discussing
here.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
i
come
now
to
a
second
problem
that
this
case
poses.
then
(inaudible)
the
purpose
served
by
the
decree
of
the
court
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman,
namely
the
prevention
of
excessive
entanglement
will
be
frustrated
if
the
payments
are
to
be
made.
the
commonwealth
of
course
had
to
make
a
determination
of
the
eligibility
of
the
schools
before
it
could
have
taken
the
position
in
court
asking
that
these
schools
be
permitted
to
be
paid
the
money
in
question.
and
admittedly,
the
very
activities
which
the
act
required
the
commonwealth
to
go
through,
the
speedy
inspection,
the
surveillance,
the
audits
and
what
not
was
precisely
what
was
offensive
to
this
court
as
it
reviewed
the
act
in
question.
the
price,
in
other
words
of
payment
to
the
schools
would
be
the
subjecting
the
schools
to
these
various
kinds
of
controls
and
inspections
and
checkups
which
this
court
said
constituted
excessive
entanglement
between
the
state
and
the
church
schools.
i’d
like
to
focus,
if
we
might,
on
precisely
what
these
inspections
and
so
on,
what
the
requirements
of
the
act
were.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
contemplates
that
it
will
have
been
done.
mr.
william
b.
ball
precisely.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that’s
right.
the
act
calls
for
reimbursement
of
what
it
describes
as
actual
cost,
actual
cost
of
two
things.
teachers’
salaries
not
teachers’
salaries,
but
the
teachers’
salaries
allocated
to
the
four
subjects.
the
number
of
hours
a
teacher
logs
in
for
example
in
high
school
french
1.
secondly,
instructional
materials
and
textbooks
allocated
again
to
the
four
subjects.
actual
costs
of
these.
now,
as
to
the
textbooks
and
instructional
materials,
looking
at
it
now
from
the
point
of
view
in
entanglement,
the
act
required
that
these
be
previously
approved
prior
to
use,
prior
to
use
in
the
classroom,
prior
to
any
reimbursement
of
these
books,
previously
approved
and
the
regulations
spell
that
after.
the
regulations
say
that
a
list
of
textbooks
used
by
participating
nonpublic
schools
and
programs
for
which
payment
is
sought
onto
the
act
shall
be
submitted
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
by
the
nonpublic
schools.
thereafter,
the
superintendent
shall
review
each
list
and
will
notify
the
nonpublic
school
of
his
approval
in
whole
or
in
part
of
a
list
of
textbooks
being
guided
by
the
requirements
of
the
act.
so
as
far
as
textbooks
and
instructional
materials
are
concerned,
these
had
to
have
been
previously
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
superintendent
of
education.
this
has
been
discharged.
this
is
an
accomplished
fact.
payment
is
not
going
to
cause
some
state
official
now
to
go
into
classrooms
and
begin
to
examine
books.
secondly
as
to
teachers’
salaries,
the
classes
involved
took
place
years
ago.
so
that
if
it
were
asked
was
the
worthy
secularity
requirements
of
the
act
observed
in
the
teaching
of
the
four
subjects,
one
would
have
to
say
that
the
commonwealth
did
perform
that
function.
that
this
case
which
mr.
bruton
cites
is
strong
evidence
of
this
fact,
but
more
important
than
that
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
clearly
established
presumption
in
the
law
of
pennsylvania.
i
cite
the
case
of
falkenburg
versus
venango
township
297
pennsylvania.
there
was
always
a
presumption
that
official
acts
or
duties
have
been
properly
performed.
and
in
general,
this
is
to
be
presumed
that
everything
done
by
an
officer
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
an
official
act
in
the
line
of
his
duty
was
legally
done.
now
the
plaintiffs
had
every
opportunity
to
rebut
that
presumption.
they
would
not
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
as
to
teachers’
salaries?
mr.
william
b.
ball
as
to
the
instruction.
i
believe
you
mean
the
instruction
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
and
there
are
two
audits
which
then
take
place.
mr.
william
b.
ball
first
of
all
there
is
an
audit
which
neither
of
us
has
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
but
it
takes
place
under
pennsylvania
law.
it’s
an
audit
of
the
state
treasurer
which
would
be
obvious
that
the
state
treasurer
would
not
certify
the
certain
school
could
be
paid
any
money,
until
the
state
treasurer’s
auditors
had
checked
out
whether
these
hours
had
been
performed,
whether
teacher
“x”
had
taught
100
hours
of
freshman
high
school
of
french,
for
example.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct.
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
now
the
secretary
of
education
of
pennsylvania
has
the
duty
to
ascertain
whether
the
instruction
in
question,
rather
in
the
course
of
the
instruction
in
question
the
secularity
requirements
of
the
act
were
observed.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
i
can
not
answer.
the
act
requires
that
no
religious
matter
be
introduced
in
the
teaching
of
the
four
subjects.
whatever
technique
the
secretary
of
education
would
use
to
ascertain
that,
whether
he
would
have
an
inspector
spot
check
classrooms,
or
whether
he
would
assume
that
in
the
absence
of
complaint,
as
we
do
in
the
public
schools
with
respect
to
bible
reading
that
in
the
absence
of
complaint,
it
is
presumed
that
the
teacher
carried
out
the
obligation
imposed
upon
him
by
law.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
perfectly
correct
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
this
course
is
not
on
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
ball
and
nothing
that
has
been
cited
on
the
brief
submitted
is
necessarily
true
or
false.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it’s
a
statement
of
counsel
about
what’s
going
on
in
another
case.
taking
that
to
be
true
however,
as
i
do,
this
evidence
is
the
fact
that
the
commonwealth
used
certain
techniques
to
determine
whether
a
particular
school
was
within
or
outside
of
the
law
of
the
secularity
requirements
of
the
law.
mr.
william
b.
ball
precisely.
it’s
entanglement
already
over.
it
is
entanglement
which
took
place.
mr.
william
b.
ball
basic
point
is
that
it
is
water
over
the
dam.
mr.
william
b.
ball
exactly.
you
see
mr.
chief
justice
we’re
not
here
to
reargue
lemon
versus
kurtzman.
i
tried
to
state
very,
very
carefully
that
these
offending
relationships
are
precisely
what
took
place.
the
fact
of
having
to
change
the
textbooks,
to
get
approval
of
textbooks,
prior
approval
of
textbooks
and
the
instruction
materials,
the
requirement
with
the
secretary
of
education
satisfy
himself
that
no
religious
matter
was
introduced
in
the
teaching
of
the
four
subjects.
all
of
that
must
be
presumed
to
have
taken
place.
the
law
is
presumed
to
have
been
carried
out,
and
the
very
fact
that
the
commonwealth’s
having
made,
having
asked
the
court
to
make
the
payments
to
the
schools,
to
permit
the
payments
to
be
made
to
the
schools.
quite
as
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i’m
quite
confident
that
there
have
been
disqualifications
of
schools.
the
plaintiffs
in
their
--
this
brief
say
that
not
only
this
school
but
several
other
schools,
christian
montgomery
academy
and
other
schools
have
been
disqualified.
the
plaintiffs
have
had
every
opportunity
to
bring
this
into
court.
they
certainly
could’ve
had
used
evidence
to
show
what
kind
of
inspections
were
made
and
whether
these
inspections
conformed
the
act,
and
in
what
instances
there
had
been
improper
inspections,
not
enough
of
them
was
on.
they
have
never
rebutted
the
presumption.
and
i
think
that
we
cannot
presume
that
the
commonwealth
would
not
carry
out
the
law.
that
the
commonwealth
could
behave
dishonestly.
any
more
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
teachers
and
administrators
in
schools
are
not
capable
of
observing
the
law,
and
acting
as
good
citizens
capable
of
understanding
and
observing
the
law
in
spite
of
all
religious
zeal
which
they
might
have.
with
respect
then
to
the
all
of
these
features,
they
have
been
discharged,
and
these,
the
factors
of
entanglement
can
no
longer
exist.
mr.
william
b.
ball
approval
of
the
textbooks.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
secondly,
the
secretary
of
education’s
check
out
of
the
teacher.
mr.
william
b.
ball
thirdly,
the
state
treasurer’s
audit.
mr.
william
b.
ball
and
fourthly,
a
post
audit.
now
the
post
audit
is
referred
to
in
the
act
and
it
is
an
audit
whereby
the
auditor,
and
according
to
the
terms
of
the
act,
the
auditor
general
examines
the
separate
funds
and
accounts
not
of
the
school,
not
of
the
whole
school
operation
at
all.
separate
funds
and
accounts
pertaining
to
the
costs
of
secular
educational
service
which
is
a
defined
term
in
the
act,
the
providing
of
services
into
four
subjects.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it’s
a
check
on
the
check
so
to
speak.
mr.
william
b.
ball
in
other
words,
let
us
what
takes
place
in
the
post
audit
is
simply
a
review
of
the
audit
of
the
state
treasurer.
in
other
words,
the
checks
which
have
been
paid
out
are
examined,
examined
against
the
allocation
of
time
if
the
teacher
is
paid
$15.00
an
hour
let
us
suppose.
and
the
record
shows
that
she
put
in
60
hours
is
the
amount
is
to
be
paid,
or
was
paid,
or
is
listed
by
certified
by
the
state
treasurer
that
she
is
to
be
paid.
does
that
equal
15
times
60?
that’s
what
that
the
audit
amounts
in
those
sense
mr.
justice
brennan.
is
it
an
examination
of
the
whole
curriculum
or
life
of
the
school?
in
no
sense,
does
it
involve
classroom
surveillance?
i
therefore
conclude
by
urging
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
as
clear
as
it
was,
and
i
hope
it
is
clear
to
the
court
that
the
interest
of
justice
are
thereby
served,
and
secondly
that
no
entanglements
for
the
future
are
possible
under
the
decree
of
the
court
below.
mr.
william
b.
ball
my
response
to
that
is
that
the
problem
of
contracting
had
been
established
in
the
1968.
there
was
a
period
between
the
enactment
of
act
109
and
the
getting
it
into
operation.
during
which,
the
school
year
1968-1969
began.
therefore,
what
was
sought
were
applications
from
any
schools
that
were
interested
in
participating
in
the
program
and
they
began
to
flow
in.
everyone
had
read
the
terms
of
the
act
and
knew
that
they
would
be
under
contract.
the
nature
of
the
contract
could
certainly
be
defined
through
a
reading
of
the
act.
and
therefore,
in
the
initial
year
tooling
up,
there
was
a
small
lag
between
the
beginning
of
september
and
january
15
for
the
issuing
of
those
first
contracts.
then
a
program
is
instituted
which
will
obviously
an
annually
repeated
program.
and
each
year
therefore,
this
date
of
january
15th
was
carried
forward
so
that
there
could
be
complete
reliance
not
merely
on
the
contract
but
more
basically
upon
the
ongoing
continuation
of
the
program.
mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
arguing
here
today
not
only
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
schools
who
are
named
in
the
complaint,
lemon
versus
kurtzman,
but
also
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
who
is
represented
here
today
by
the
attorney
general
who
sits
next
to
me
at
counsel
table.
and
on
behalf
of
the
intervenor
defendant
of
pennsylvania
association
of
independent
schools,
whose
counsel
a
distinguished
philadelphia
--
a
member
of
the
philadelphia
bar
mr.
henry
t.
reath
is
here,
and
who
has
presented
a
brief
in
this
case.
the
appellants
agree
with
the
commonwealth,
with
the
schools,
with
the
intervenor
defendant
and
with
the
court
below
that
a
decree
of
unconstitutionality
does
not
necessarily
have,
in
all
cases,
a
retrospective
effect.
rather,
the
answer
to
whether
it
does
or
does
not
would
depend
in
part
upon
considerations
of
the
interests
of
justice
and
it
will
depend
also
upon
whether
the
constitutional
policy
which
was
expressed
in
the
decree
will
be
frustrated
if
the
application
is
made
only
prospectively.
the
appellants
on
the
first
point
have
said
there
was
really
no
interest
of
justice
involved,
so
far
as
the
schools
are
concerned,
and
they
have
said
secondly,
that
the
very
crisis
of
which
the
court
attract
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
will
be
perpetuated
should
the
court
hold
and
agree
with
the
unanimous
court
below
that
this
statute
should
be,
that
its
decree
should
be
applied
only
prospectively.
and
as
these
two
points
namely,
the
question
of
the
interest
of
justice,
the
question
of
the
constitutional
policy
that
i
will
address
myself
to
in
this
argument.
now,
we
speak
of
the
interest
of
justice,
i
think
your
honors
that
we
have
to
focus
first
of
all
on
the
holders
of
that
interest.
and
in
this
case,
they
are
school
people,
they
are
educators,
they
are
people
who
are
working
with
parents
and
with
children
in
pennsylvania.
in
the
real
life
business
of
being
locked
in
a
struggle
against
inflation
and
taxation
in
educating
23%
of
the
population
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
school
population
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
some
535,000
children.
children
who
are
being
educated
in
schools
in
the
inner
city
of
philadelphia,
in
the
large
population
centers
of
pittsburgh
and
scranton,
and
erie,
and
who
are
also
found
in
the
coal
regions
and
the
rural
regions
of
that
state.
as
we
look
at
these
holders
of
this
interest
then
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
whether
they
were
in
good
faith,
whether
they
were
justified
and
reasonably
relying
upon
the
continuing
validity
of
this
act
which
was
passed
by
the
legislature.
whether
indeed
there
were
actual
real
legal
contracts
which
they
had
entered
upon,
and
whether
they
are
going
to
suffer
hardship
if
the
1970-1971
claimants
which
they
have
earned
are
not
to
denied
them.
i
too
feel
that
the
chronology
of
events
becomes
important
in
understanding
this
case.
as
counsel
has
stated,
the
act
was
passed
in
june
of
1968.
immediately
thereafter,
the
commonwealth
department
of
education
tooled
up
to
put
the
act
into
full
operation.
that
began
to
occur
immediately
upon
the
passage
of
the
act,
and
by
the
fall,
time
of
the
opening
of
the
school
year
an
office
to
administer
this
act
had
been
set
up
and
paid
employees
of
that
office
appointed,
and
their
work
had
begun.
indeed,
counsel
speaks
of
the
regulations
which
counsel’s
briefs
tells
us
appeared
in
december
of
that
year.
these
were
created
in
the
fall
of
that
year.
thus,
the
fact
that
a
challenge
to
this
act
had
been
announced
in
the
press
immediately
upon
the
passage
of
the
act,
but
no
suit
brought
certainly
gave
the
administrators
of
the
schools
reasonable
reliance,
at
least
a
measure
of
it
that
the
act
was
going
to
remain
unchallenged.
the
plaintiffs
had
every
opportunity
to
bring
an
injunction
action
that
very
fall
because
money
was
committed
to
the
program
and
that
program
was
in
on
operation
at
this
time,
they
neglected
to
do
so.
mr.
william
b.
ball
in
june
of
1968,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that’s
correct.
and
there
was
full
opportunity
for
the
plaintiffs
to
have
brought
their
suit.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
action
was
brought
june
3,
1969.
mr.
william
b.
ball
almost
a
year.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
correct
as
counsel
in
his
statement
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
the
group
that
announced
that
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
a
spokesman
for
an
organization
known
as
americans
united
and
the
speech
given
at
pittsburgh.
counsel
has
said
and
admitted
in
his
argument
today
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
plural
did
announce
this
at
this
time.
thus,
this
was
apparently
with
the
concurrence
of
those
who
ultimately
did
become
all
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
now
then,
contracts
were
entered
into
january
15,
1969.
why
the
delay
if
this
was
a
true
contractual
situation?
in
this
governmental
program
as
in
many
similar
programs,
say
if
the
federal
government,
sometimes
legislation
is
passed
putting
a
program
into
effect.
then
the
people
who
are
going
to
participate
in
the
program
enter
into
application
relationships
in
anticipation
of
entering
contracts
under
the
program,
and
they
then
go
ahead
and
execute
the
contract
at
some
later
date.
and
this
is
how
that
january
15
date
gets
locked
in
to
the
annual
renewal
of
the
program.
1181
schools
entered
into
contracts
with
the
commonwealth,
and
i
should
like
to
pause
here
briefly
to
cover
a
point
that
i
don’t
think
is
essential
for
our
case,
though
i
think
it
does
add
to
the
interest
of
justice
the
equity
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
appropriations
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
would
not
become
available
till
the
following
september.
in
other
words,
the
first
payment
these
are
payments
by
reimbursement
in
a
typical
purchase
and
service
situation,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
first
payment
would
be
made
for
the
1968-1969
school
year.
the
first
payment
would
be
made
in
september
1969.
payments
were
always
after
the
fact.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
passing
word
about
contracts
because
we
do
not
think
that
the
existence
of
a
contract
is
essential
to
our
case
though
we
believe
it
adds
to
the
equities
of
our
case.
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
in
its
original
decision
upholding
the
act,
310
federal
supplement
at
page
40
called
these
contracts.
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
the
pennsylvania
law
which
is
applicable
to
these
agreements
and
which
clearly
demonstrates
their
contracts.
if
these
are
not
contracts,
then
the
purchase
of
service
contract
which
typifies
all
sorts
of
arrangements
between
states
and
sectarian
institutions
of
welfare
and
health,
and
care
of
the
aged,
childcare
and
so
on,
are
certainly
not
contracts
though
they
have
been
upheld
as
contracts
in
case
after
case.
among
these
the
leading
pennsylvania
case
on
purchase
of
service
from
sectarian
child
caring
institutions,
shade
versus
allegheny
county
institution
district
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
under
these
contracts
and
under
the
arrangement,
under
the
service
which
took
place
in
pursuant
to
the
act.
first
of
all,
it
was
necessary
that
the
sectarian
schools
replaced
any
religiously
oriented
textbooks
which
they
might
have
in
the
four
subjects
covered
by
the
act
with
books
which
had
to
have
the
prior
approval
of
the
state
secretary
of
education
as
provided
in
the
act
and
the
regulations.
furthermore,
they
had
to
conform
their
teaching
plans
to
the
severe
secularity
requirements
of
the
act,
so
that
in
the
teaching
of
these
four
subjects,
those
requirements
would
be
observed.
they
also
had
to
setup
separate
accounting
systems
according
to
one
provision
of
the
act,
whereby
they
had
to
keep
separate
accounts
related
to
these
four
subjects.
they
made
administrative
changes
obviously
in
the
areas
pertaining
to
teacher
certification
requirements
under
the
act,
and
also
with
respect
to
standardized
testing
which
came
as
a
new
requirement
to
many
of
the
schools
and
was
aimed
in
improving
quality.
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
made
note
of
the
fact
that
the
very
purpose
of
this
program
was
to
enhance,
and
this
court
found
was
to
enhance
the
quality
of
education
in
the
schools
which
were
served
under
the
act.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no
indeed.
and
the
fact
that
the
schools
now
did
in
some
cases
what
they
had
been
doing
before
now
being
funded
for
it,
present
us
a
picture
very,
very
similar
to
what
happens
under
medicaid,
to
what
happens
under
other
kinds
of
purchase
of
service
agreements.
that
is
to
say
the
state
enters
into
a
contract
with
let
us
say
a
sectarian
child
caring
institution.
it
does
so,
and
this
brings
us
back
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger
this
morning.
it
does
so
because
it
has
a
public
need.
the
state
has
a
need
for
that
service.
it
needs
to
have
someone
take
care
let’s
say
of
dependent
and
neglected
children.
so
it
goes
to
a
sectarian
institution,
child
caring
institution,
and
pays
it
to
carry
on
this
publicly
needed
service.
the
institution
itself
does
nothing
more
than
it
did
before,
but
it
is
now
aided
materially
in
the
rendering
of
that
service,
and
indeed
it
may
improve
the
services.
we
happen
to
know
that
in
pennsylvania,
what
this
act
meant
was
that
a
school
which
had
a
class
let’s
say
of
70
children
in
a
math
class
could
now
split
that
into
two
or
three
sections.
a
school
which
had
not
been
able
to
afford
to
have
a
calculus
course
could
now
hire
a
calculus
teacher.
a
school
which
had
not
previously
had
a
course
in
spanish
could
now
institute
a
course
in
spanish.
mr.
william
b.
ball
or
indeed
it
did,
yes.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
finally,
the
act
itself
four
times
uses
the
term
contract,
which
i
think
is
significant
in
terms
of
pennsylvania’s
legislation
knowing
pennsylvania’s
law
and
knowing
what
it
was
doing
pursuant
to
that
law.
then
in
june
3,
1969
the
plaintiffs
instituted
their
case.
the
program
goes
into
its
second
year.
and
in
november
28,
1969
the
very
form
selected
by
the
plaintiffs,
three-judge
federal
court
of
philadelphia,
upholds
the
act
as
being
constitutional.
i
could
scarcely
think
of
a
greater
incentive
to
the
schools
to
continue
to
serve
under
this
act.
as
to
the
commonwealth,
the
commonwealth
had
no
need
to
have
a
reliance
upon
the
act.
the
commonwealth
was
bound
by
the
act,
bound
by
the
law
of
pennsylvania
to
continue
the
program.
thereafter,
in
may
15,
1970
the
decision
of
this
court
in
walz
versus
the
tax
commission
takes
place.
there
was
some
comment
during
mr.
bruton’s
argument
with
respect
to
the
walz
case.
this
seemed
to
us
as
turnings
of
this
decision.
first
of
all
to
uphold
direct
aid
to
religion,
this
was
the
fact
of
the
case,
the
most
essential
part
of
it.
it
did
nothing
to
disturb
the
purpose
and
effect
test
in
allen,
and
allen’s
careful
demarcation
of
the
secular
function
which
was
found
to
be
supportable
by
the
public
in
that
case.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that’s
perfectly
true
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
the
fact
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that,
but
on
balance
as
we
read
that
opinion,
we
felt
that
it
did
not
disturb
and
could
not
have
disturbed
what
was
already
determined
by
the
court
in
board
of
education
versus
allen,
where
we
have
a
clear
support
with
public
funds
of
the
secular
function
clearly
spelled
out
by
the
court
which
takes
place
or
is
offered
in
sectarian
schools.
we
were
also
encouraged
by
the
fact
that
there
was
extensive
italicizing
by
the
chief
justice
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
of
a
number
of
passages
from
cases
in
which
the
aid
which
had
been
given
to
sectarian
education
as
for
example
in
allen
was
heavily
stressed.
again,
we
have
the
authority
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
walz
case
who
all
but
predicted
that
the
walz
decision
lead
directly
to
support
of
aid
to
parochial
schools.
again
we
found
no
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
indeed
was
a
dissent,
but
a
very
authoritative
dissent,
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
william
b.
ball
we
also
examined
the
concept
of
entanglement
in
terms
of,
or
in
comparison
to
the
extensive
regulation
of
nonpublic
schools
which
this
court
had
pointed
to
in
board
of
education
versus
allen.
we
did
not
think
that
the
provisions
with
respect
to
secularity,
with
respect
to
church
school
or
state
school
relationships
contained
in
act
109
added
a
feathers
weight
to
the
kind
of
relationship
which
was
already
considered
licit
in
the
law
and
which
had
been
recognized
by
this
court.
the
school
administrators
both
sectarian
and
nonsectarian
had
no
complaint
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
this
act.
conceivably
there
would
be
sense
to
it,
and
again
we
saw
no
degree
of
relationship
such
as
is
observed
in
purchase
of
service
arrangements
in
the
welfare
and
healthcare
fields.
and
thus,
we
think
that
the
situation
as
we
came
in
to
the
1970-1971
school
year
was
one
in
which
this
act
had
been
upheld
by
a
court
chosen
by
the
plaintiffs.
we
thought
this
act
basically
did
not
confront
the
decision
of
the
court
in
walz
and
therefore,
we
think
it
was
a
complete
basis
for
a
lawyer’s
reliance
in
proceeding
with
the
contracts
for
the
coming
year.
but
we
are
talking
here
not
about
a
lawyer’s
reliance,
but
educator’s
reliance,
people
who
are
in
the
job
of
educating
and
whose
schools
desperately
needed
the
funding
in
question.
those
people
and
the
parents
who
are
the
basic
source
of
support
of
the
schools
in
question,
and
they
certainly
could
not
have
desisted
from
the
program
in
accordance
with
the
ethical
obligation
which
they
have
to
their
constituents.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
there
were
indeed
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
stress
is
this,
that
if
we’re
talking
here
about
the
good
faith
reliance,
i
think
that
we
do
not
and
cannot
impose
upon
either
the
turnings
for
the
schools,
the
duties
of
predicting
where
this
court
would’ve
gone
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
the
test
case.
i
think
in
the
second
place,
the
educators,
the
people
who
are
operating
schools
and
the
parents
will
certainly
bond
to
continue
the
program,
and
having
before
them
--
having
before
them
not
a
decision
of
this
court
striking
down
such
a
program,
but
having
before
them
a
decision
of
the
district
court
upholding
the
program.
i
couldn’t
imagine
better
basis
for
reliance
and
good
faith
reliance.
the
decision
came
down
finally
june
28,
1971.
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court,
the
supreme
court
not
attempting
to
spell
out
to
rule
upon
the
effect
of
its
this
decision
in
kurtzman.
the
court
below,
after
full
briefing
an
argument
unanimously,
this
time
including
judge
hastie,
held
that
the
effect
of
this
decree
should
be
prospective
only,
and
pointed
to
the
elements,
reliance
and
hardship
which
we’ve
been
discussing
here.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
i
come
now
to
a
second
problem
that
this
case
poses.
then
(inaudible)
the
purpose
served
by
the
decree
of
the
court
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman,
namely
the
prevention
of
excessive
entanglement
will
be
frustrated
if
the
payments
are
to
be
made.
the
commonwealth
of
course
had
to
make
a
determination
of
the
eligibility
of
the
schools
before
it
could
have
taken
the
position
in
court
asking
that
these
schools
be
permitted
to
be
paid
the
money
in
question.
and
admittedly,
the
very
activities
which
the
act
required
the
commonwealth
to
go
through,
the
speedy
inspection,
the
surveillance,
the
audits
and
what
not
was
precisely
what
was
offensive
to
this
court
as
it
reviewed
the
act
in
question.
the
price,
in
other
words
of
payment
to
the
schools
would
be
the
subjecting
the
schools
to
these
various
kinds
of
controls
and
inspections
and
checkups
which
this
court
said
constituted
excessive
entanglement
between
the
state
and
the
church
schools.
i’d
like
to
focus,
if
we
might,
on
precisely
what
these
inspections
and
so
on,
what
the
requirements
of
the
act
were.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
contemplates
that
it
will
have
been
done.
mr.
william
b.
ball
precisely.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that’s
right.
the
act
calls
for
reimbursement
of
what
it
describes
as
actual
cost,
actual
cost
of
two
things.
teachers’
salaries
not
teachers’
salaries,
but
the
teachers’
salaries
allocated
to
the
four
subjects.
the
number
of
hours
a
teacher
logs
in
for
example
in
high
school
french
1.
secondly,
instructional
materials
and
textbooks
allocated
again
to
the
four
subjects.
actual
costs
of
these.
now,
as
to
the
textbooks
and
instructional
materials,
looking
at
it
now
from
the
point
of
view
in
entanglement,
the
act
required
that
these
be
previously
approved
prior
to
use,
prior
to
use
in
the
classroom,
prior
to
any
reimbursement
of
these
books,
previously
approved
and
the
regulations
spell
that
after.
the
regulations
say
that
a
list
of
textbooks
used
by
participating
nonpublic
schools
and
programs
for
which
payment
is
sought
onto
the
act
shall
be
submitted
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
by
the
nonpublic
schools.
thereafter,
the
superintendent
shall
review
each
list
and
will
notify
the
nonpublic
school
of
his
approval
in
whole
or
in
part
of
a
list
of
textbooks
being
guided
by
the
requirements
of
the
act.
so
as
far
as
textbooks
and
instructional
materials
are
concerned,
these
had
to
have
been
previously
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
superintendent
of
education.
this
has
been
discharged.
this
is
an
accomplished
fact.
payment
is
not
going
to
cause
some
state
official
now
to
go
into
classrooms
and
begin
to
examine
books.
secondly
as
to
teachers’
salaries,
the
classes
involved
took
place
years
ago.
so
that
if
it
were
asked
was
the
worthy
secularity
requirements
of
the
act
observed
in
the
teaching
of
the
four
subjects,
one
would
have
to
say
that
the
commonwealth
did
perform
that
function.
that
this
case
which
mr.
bruton
cites
is
strong
evidence
of
this
fact,
but
more
important
than
that
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
clearly
established
presumption
in
the
law
of
pennsylvania.
i
cite
the
case
of
falkenburg
versus
venango
township
297
pennsylvania.
there
was
always
a
presumption
that
official
acts
or
duties
have
been
properly
performed.
and
in
general,
this
is
to
be
presumed
that
everything
done
by
an
officer
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
an
official
act
in
the
line
of
his
duty
was
legally
done.
now
the
plaintiffs
had
every
opportunity
to
rebut
that
presumption.
they
would
not
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
as
to
teachers’
salaries?
mr.
william
b.
ball
as
to
the
instruction.
i
believe
you
mean
the
instruction
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
ball
and
there
are
two
audits
which
then
take
place.
mr.
william
b.
ball
first
of
all
there
is
an
audit
which
neither
of
us
has
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
but
it
takes
place
under
pennsylvania
law.
it’s
an
audit
of
the
state
treasurer
which
would
be
obvious
that
the
state
treasurer
would
not
certify
the
certain
school
could
be
paid
any
money,
until
the
state
treasurer’s
auditors
had
checked
out
whether
these
hours
had
been
performed,
whether
teacher
“x”
had
taught
100
hours
of
freshman
high
school
of
french,
for
example.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct.
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
now
the
secretary
of
education
of
pennsylvania
has
the
duty
to
ascertain
whether
the
instruction
in
question,
rather
in
the
course
of
the
instruction
in
question
the
secularity
requirements
of
the
act
were
observed.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
i
can
not
answer.
the
act
requires
that
no
religious
matter
be
introduced
in
the
teaching
of
the
four
subjects.
whatever
technique
the
secretary
of
education
would
use
to
ascertain
that,
whether
he
would
have
an
inspector
spot
check
classrooms,
or
whether
he
would
assume
that
in
the
absence
of
complaint,
as
we
do
in
the
public
schools
with
respect
to
bible
reading
that
in
the
absence
of
complaint,
it
is
presumed
that
the
teacher
carried
out
the
obligation
imposed
upon
him
by
law.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
perfectly
correct
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
this
course
is
not
on
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
ball
and
nothing
that
has
been
cited
on
the
brief
submitted
is
necessarily
true
or
false.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it’s
a
statement
of
counsel
about
what’s
going
on
in
another
case.
taking
that
to
be
true
however,
as
i
do,
this
evidence
is
the
fact
that
the
commonwealth
used
certain
techniques
to
determine
whether
a
particular
school
was
within
or
outside
of
the
law
of
the
secularity
requirements
of
the
law.
mr.
william
b.
ball
precisely.
it’s
entanglement
already
over.
it
is
entanglement
which
took
place.
mr.
william
b.
ball
basic
point
is
that
it
is
water
over
the
dam.
mr.
william
b.
ball
exactly.
you
see
mr.
chief
justice
we’re
not
here
to
reargue
lemon
versus
kurtzman.
i
tried
to
state
very,
very
carefully
that
these
offending
relationships
are
precisely
what
took
place.
the
fact
of
having
to
change
the
textbooks,
to
get
approval
of
textbooks,
prior
approval
of
textbooks
and
the
instruction
materials,
the
requirement
with
the
secretary
of
education
satisfy
himself
that
no
religious
matter
was
introduced
in
the
teaching
of
the
four
subjects.
all
of
that
must
be
presumed
to
have
taken
place.
the
law
is
presumed
to
have
been
carried
out,
and
the
very
fact
that
the
commonwealth’s
having
made,
having
asked
the
court
to
make
the
payments
to
the
schools,
to
permit
the
payments
to
be
made
to
the
schools.
quite
as
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i’m
quite
confident
that
there
have
been
disqualifications
of
schools.
the
plaintiffs
in
their
--
this
brief
say
that
not
only
this
school
but
several
other
schools,
christian
montgomery
academy
and
other
schools
have
been
disqualified.
the
plaintiffs
have
had
every
opportunity
to
bring
this
into
court.
they
certainly
could’ve
had
used
evidence
to
show
what
kind
of
inspections
were
made
and
whether
these
inspections
conformed
the
act,
and
in
what
instances
there
had
been
improper
inspections,
not
enough
of
them
was
on.
they
have
never
rebutted
the
presumption.
and
i
think
that
we
cannot
presume
that
the
commonwealth
would
not
carry
out
the
law.
that
the
commonwealth
could
behave
dishonestly.
any
more
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
teachers
and
administrators
in
schools
are
not
capable
of
observing
the
law,
and
acting
as
good
citizens
capable
of
understanding
and
observing
the
law
in
spite
of
all
religious
zeal
which
they
might
have.
with
respect
then
to
the
all
of
these
features,
they
have
been
discharged,
and
these,
the
factors
of
entanglement
can
no
longer
exist.
mr.
william
b.
ball
approval
of
the
textbooks.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
secondly,
the
secretary
of
education’s
check
out
of
the
teacher.
mr.
william
b.
ball
thirdly,
the
state
treasurer’s
audit.
mr.
william
b.
ball
and
fourthly,
a
post
audit.
now
the
post
audit
is
referred
to
in
the
act
and
it
is
an
audit
whereby
the
auditor,
and
according
to
the
terms
of
the
act,
the
auditor
general
examines
the
separate
funds
and
accounts
not
of
the
school,
not
of
the
whole
school
operation
at
all.
separate
funds
and
accounts
pertaining
to
the
costs
of
secular
educational
service
which
is
a
defined
term
in
the
act,
the
providing
of
services
into
four
subjects.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it’s
a
check
on
the
check
so
to
speak.
mr.
william
b.
ball
in
other
words,
let
us
what
takes
place
in
the
post
audit
is
simply
a
review
of
the
audit
of
the
state
treasurer.
in
other
words,
the
checks
which
have
been
paid
out
are
examined,
examined
against
the
allocation
of
time
if
the
teacher
is
paid
$15.00
an
hour
let
us
suppose.
and
the
record
shows
that
she
put
in
60
hours
is
the
amount
is
to
be
paid,
or
was
paid,
or
is
listed
by
certified
by
the
state
treasurer
that
she
is
to
be
paid.
does
that
equal
15
times
60?
that’s
what
that
the
audit
amounts
in
those
sense
mr.
justice
brennan.
is
it
an
examination
of
the
whole
curriculum
or
life
of
the
school?
in
no
sense,
does
it
involve
classroom
surveillance?
i
therefore
conclude
by
urging
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
as
clear
as
it
was,
and
i
hope
it
is
clear
to
the
court
that
the
interest
of
justice
are
thereby
served,
and
secondly
that
no
entanglements
for
the
future
are
possible
under
the
decree
of
the
court
below.
mr.
william
b.
ball
my
response
to
that
is
that
the
problem
of
contracting
had
been
established
in
the
1968.
there
was
a
period
between
the
enactment
of
act
109
and
the
getting
it
into
operation.
during
which,
the
school
year
1968-1969
began.
therefore,
what
was
sought
were
applications
from
any
schools
that
were
interested
in
participating
in
the
program
and
they
began
to
flow
in.
everyone
had
read
the
terms
of
the
act
and
knew
that
they
would
be
under
contract.
the
nature
of
the
contract
could
certainly
be
defined
through
a
reading
of
the
act.
and
therefore,
in
the
initial
year
tooling
up,
there
was
a
small
lag
between
the
beginning
of
september
and
january
15
for
the
issuing
of
those
first
contracts.
then
a
program
is
instituted
which
will
obviously
an
annually
repeated
program.
and
each
year
therefore,
this
date
of
january
15th
was
carried
forward
so
that
there
could
be
complete
reliance
not
merely
on
the
contract
but
more
basically
upon
the
ongoing
continuation
of
the
program.
