chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-1470,
lemon
against
kurtzman.
mr.
bruton
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
these
agreements
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
these
funds
can’t
be
disbursed
now
as
a
constitutional
matter,
then
recovery
of
the
amounts
paid
in
prior
years
is
in
what
status
in
your
view?
laying
aside
the
intentions
of
the
parties,
constitutionally
could
they
be
recovered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
policy
would
you
call
that?
what
kind
of
policy
would
we
be
employing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
official
policy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
agreement
to
say
“constitutional
rulings.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
all
judicial
--
all
judicial
rulings
are
not
retroactive,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean,
you
put
emphasis
on
constitutional
ruling,
constitutional
adjudication?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
reliance
factor
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
there
a
quid
in
the
sense
broadly
for
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
or
any
other
state
in
that
the
maintenance
of
private
schools
relieves
the
state
of
considerable
burden,
and
that
even
an
open
subsidy
identified
as
the
subsidy
is
a
partial
recompense
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you’re
now
talking
just
about
contract
law
and
not
the
constitutional
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
a
moment
here
to
find
page
9
of
the
appendix,
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
jurisdictional
statement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
the
course
of
the
conduct
over
the
relationships
between
the
parties
that
might
give
a
basis
for
some
reliance,
haven’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
entanglement
of
trying
to
determine
these
past
events?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
be
appropriate
for
someone
at
some
point
to
try
to
find
out
where
their
$24
million
if
that’s
the
amount
involved
here,
would
have
a
rationale
relationship
to
the
totality
of
secular
education
costs
involved
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
would
it
be
more
than,
not
fully
pay
for,
would
it
be
more
than
the
total
secular
education
expense
that
these
private
schools
dealt
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
think
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ball.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ball,
when
were
the
appropriations
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
you’re
--
do
i
understand
that
what
you’re
saying
is
that
in
effect
in
january
1969
effect
was
that
they
executed
a
formal
contract
that
carried
out
informal
understandings
and
agreements
that
had
been
reached
beginning
with
the
opening
of
the
school
or
before
the
opening
of
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
its
fair
--
isn’t
it
fair
to
say
that
the
court’s
opinion
indicated
some
doubts
about,
at
least
doubt
about
direct
subsidies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
take
it
you’re
addressing
yourself
in
part
at
least
to
the
predictability
of
the
court’s
holding
on
this
program
as
of
sometime
before
the
holding
was
actually
rendered?
i
suppose
it’s
reasonable
to
assume
that
people
trying
to
make
that
prediction
would
be
entitled
now
to
look
at
the
fact
that
some
members
of
the
court
didn’t
agree
with
the
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
recall
now
for
the
numbers
in
the
first
lemon
kurtzman,
there
were
dissenting
opinions
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
they
were
representing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
recall
it,
judge
hastie
dissented
in
the
first
three-judge
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
that
entanglement
that
formed
the
basis
of
the
court’s
holding
in
the
prior
case,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
said
that
under
pennsylvania
law
that
it’s
presumptively
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
