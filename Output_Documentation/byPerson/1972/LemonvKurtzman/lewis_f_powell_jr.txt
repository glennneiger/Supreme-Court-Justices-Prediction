justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
ball,
will
you
take
just
a
minute
and
try
to
get
me
clear
on
the
point
that
mr.
bruton
was
making
as
i
understood
in
that
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
record
as
to
the
date
the
contracts
were
entered
into?
i
think
he
said
they
were
entered
into
january
15,
1971
for
the
school
year
1970-1971,
and
therefore
they
could’ve
been
no
reliance
on
the
contracts
since
the
school
year
was
half
over.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
