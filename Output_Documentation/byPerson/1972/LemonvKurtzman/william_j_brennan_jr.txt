justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
are
the
contracts
that
were
made
in
january,
something
1971?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
school
year
i
gather,
begins
september
doesn’t
it
or
august?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
the
amount
for
the
1969
that
you
actually
disbursed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
sum
that
you
now
have
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
had
sought
an
injunction
would
it
have
been
against
disbursements,
or
against
entering
under
these
agreements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
that
montgomery
school,
is
it
a
disbursement
for
the
1970-1971
school
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
why
you
call
them
“so
called?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
it’s
a
subsidy
really?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
will
you
state
again
mr.
bruton
the
date
on
which
the
district
court
first
held
that
statute
unconstitutional
in
relation
to
this
january
15,
1971
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
to
what
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
constitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
at
least
so
far
as
would
any
judicial
determination,
that
determination
was
favorable
at
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
of
the
time
these
agreements
were
made.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
infer
it
correctly
mr.
bruton
that
if
you’re
wrong
in
this
reliance
point,
your
case
is
lost?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
mr.
bruton,
for
what
you’ve
been
telling
us
about
the
philadelphia
montgomery
case,
do
i
get
this
correctly?
at
least
in
its
administration,
the
state
itself
has
felt
that
some
kind
of
inquiry
of
this
nature
had
to
be
made
as
to
each
of
the
schools
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it
was
determined
therefore
that
perhaps
this
involves
some
support
of
the
religious
education
in
school,
and
therefore,
that
that
school
was
not
qualified.
does
this
suggest
that
this
would
have
to
be
done
then
by
the
or
is
this
what
the
state
intends
to
do
as
to
every
school
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
which
this
24
million
would
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
was
--
was
this
a
single
district
judge
who
took
the
view
he
couldn’t
look
into
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
actually
mr.
ball,
when
was
the
action
brought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
almost
a
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
announcement
had
been
made
upon
its
adoption
that
one
would
be
brought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
it
the
folks
who
announced
that
they
were
going
to
bring
it,
in
fact
the
ones
who
did
bring
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
expect
mr.
ball
that’s
not
to
suggest
that
the
schools
had
this
act
not
been
passed,
would
not
have
taught
these
four
subject.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
to
suggest
then
that
in
fact,
this
enable
expansion
of
faculties
at
least
in
terms
of
numbers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
ball
am
i
not
right
that
at
least
some
of
the
opinions
in
walz
suggest
that
there
might
be
a
distinction
between
subsidy
situations
and
tax
exemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
a
dissent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i’m
sure
of
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
before
you
do
mr.
ball
may
i
ask
does
payment
out
of
this
$24
million
contemplate
doing
this
as
to
each
of
the
recipient
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
before
the
money
is
paid
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you’re
now
going
to
tell
us
it
should
be
done
before
the
money
is
paid
out,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
know
in
fact
exactly
what
audit
procedures
were
followed
as
to
teachers’
salaries?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
tell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
said
mr.
ball
perhaps
i
didn’t
catch
it
correctly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
a
teacher
logged
in
a
certain
number
of
hours?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
submits,
i
gather,
the
school
submits
in
her
behalf
a
reimbursement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
school
of
the
amount
paid
out
to
that
teacher,
isn’t
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
what
i
was,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
that’s
the
extent
of
his
audit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
does
he
go
about
doing
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
mr.
ball,
we
have
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
us
what
in
fact
he
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
this
philadelphia,
the
case
that
mr.
bruton
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn’t
that
get
us
into
the
very
problem
of
entanglement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
now
mr.
ball,
whether
there
been
any
disqualifications
of
schools
upon
that
kind
of
audit,
and
a
determination
that
they
had
been
teaching
these?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
mr.
ball,
those
are
the
only
two
audit
operations
had
take
place?
one
of
the
treasurer
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
then
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
audit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
this
a
check
on
the
state
officials,
rather
than
a
check
on
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
are
the
contracts
that
were
made
in
january,
something
1971?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
school
year
i

it

william
j.

for
that
montgomery
school,
is
it
a
disbursement
for
the
1970-1971
school
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
why
you
call
them
“so
called?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
it’s
a
subsidy
really?
justice
william

was

so
at

so
