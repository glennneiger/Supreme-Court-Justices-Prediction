mr.
matthew
w.
goring
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
interested
in
several
of
the
colloquy
between
counsel
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
the
preceding
case
in
the
court.
one
of
my
interests
lies
in
the
dealing
of
the
government
with
the
subjective
evidence.
at
one
point
in
the
briefing
of
this
case,
a
suggestion
seem
to
me
clearly
was
that
my
subjective
evidence,
the
government
did
not
elect
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
subjective
evidence
should
not
be
admitted
and
indeed
they
made
no
objection
to
the
kind
of
evidence
we
are
talking
about
at
the
trial
level.
nonetheless,
admissible
or
not,
the
court
should
not
take
it
into
account
to
any
degree.
now,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggest,
the
government's
attitude
would
be
quite
different
in
the
subjective
evidence
they
were
thinking.
now,
we
have
the
same
sort
of
problem
in
the
court
below
and
this
is
somewhat
diverting
but
it
is
enlightening,
i
believe
with
respect
to
post-acquisition
evidence.
and
on
page
195
of
the
appendix,
what
trial
counsel
for
the
government
says
in
substance
is
that
in
some
cases,
well
this
is
a
quote,
“in
some
cases,
post-acquisition
evidence
showing
any
competitive
effects
after
an
acquisition
is
relevant.
however,
post-acquisition
evidence
to
show
what
would
have
been
had
this
particular
acquisition
not
taking
place.”
in
other
words,
if
the
evidence
to
be
introduced
was
such
to
show
that
after
an
acquisition
anticompetitive
effects
had
been
felt
in
the
marketplace
that
would
be
admissible.
judge
day
said
it
would
seem
that
a
court
common
justice
would
dictate.
the
evidence
indicated
the
other
way
ought
to
prevent
--
permit
a
defendant
to
introduce
it
and
(inaudible)
and
apply
the
merge.
now
that's
the
same
matter
to
the
government
has
about
subjective
evidence
and
let
me
turn
to
the
subjective
evidence
and
speak
upon
it.
while
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
clearly
suggest
and
i
know
of
no
contrary
decision
that
it
does
not
deem
its
function
to
retry
cases
and
will
not
do
it.
whether
examination
is
into
that
question
of
whether
the
findings
below
were
clearly
erroneous,
the
discussion
have
got
to
run
the
gamut
of
significant
evidence.
now,
the
evidence
that
were
talking
about
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
that
is
not
the
entire
standard
he
applied.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
he
referred
to
that
as
significant.
what
he
says
about
it
in
the
broad
is
incredible
evidence
establishes
and
it
was
not
a
potential
entrant
into
said
market,
by
any
means
or
way
other
than
by
said
acquisition.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
he
doesn't
--
that
is
correct.
he
does
not
refer
the
question
of
whether
fact
a
or
fact
b
leads
him
to
that
conclusion.
however
in
the
record
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
both
facets
have
some
significance
if
they
both
exist
that
is
the
likelihood
of
entry
and
the
apprehension
in
the
industry,
in
the
market.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
there
was
no
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
--
evidence
of
any
kind
that
that
apprehension
existed,
none
whatever.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
you
can't
from
the
record
pinpoint
it.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
things
that
i'm
talking
about
are
in
the
records
and
the
things
--
some
of
the
things
which
we
have
just
talked
about
a
moment
two
ago
are
not.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
evidence
offered
by
the
government
that
the
industry
in
the
new
england
market
had
any
apprehension
that
falstaff
would
enter
the
market.
and
there
was
therefore
no
threat
by
virtue
of
their
being
400
miles
away
which
the
government
suggested
in
new
england.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
if
there
were
any
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
there
are
no
facts
about
the
profitability
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
--
of
any
entry
which
could've
been
made
by
falstaff.
now
the
government
started
this
case
in
1965.
it
took
a
large
quantity
of
depositions.
it
sought
answers
to
a
large
quantity
of
interrogatories.
it
served
upon
falstaff
before
the
acquisition,
for
the
consummation
of
the
acquisition,
cid,
seeking
extensive
information.
after
the
commencement
of
the
suit,
it
took
extensive
depositions.
now
i
had
it
chosen
to
try
and
show
state
of
mind
of
the
industry
in
new
england
with
respect
to
the
threat
of
entry
by
falstaff,
there
were
large
quantity
of
witnesses
who
could
have
been
interrogated
on
this
point
other
members
of
the
industry.
and
i
suggest
to
some
evidence
of
that
kind
is
essential.
i
see
no
way,
no
reasonable
way
of
suggesting
but
that
in
the
industry,
one
competitor
who
does
not
know
something
about
what
another
possible
competitor
is
doing
and
thinking.
now,
the
reason
behind,
i'm
having
to
mixed
these
things
up
in
part,
but
the
reason
behind,
the
determination
of
falstaff
management,
not
to
enter
new
england
market
either
independently
or
by
what
is
referred
to
as
a
toe-hold
entry,
whatever
that
mean,
laying
the
fact
that
they
had
attempted
to
enter
the
detroit
market.
they
had
attempted
to
penetrate
chicago
market.
they
being
in
the
north
--
in
north
--
northern
california,
attempted
to
penetrate
the
southern
california
market.
and
in
each
case,
those
attempts
were
dismal
failures.
and
they
were
dismal
failures
so
mr.
griesedieck
testified
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
not
in
fact
when
they
went
into
these
areas
a
healthy
distributor
organization
and
in
at
least
one
of
them,
their
attempt
to
create
one
after
entering
the
market
were
a
failure.
and
their
conclusions
were
that
they'll
make
no
attempt
to
enter
a
market
thereafter.
this
occurred
before
1964,
1965.
they
would
make
no
attempts
to
penetrate
the
market
unless
they
knew
that
they
had
a
distributor
organization
which
was
energetic,
healthy,
and
which
promise
to
be
able
to
sell
the
product
which
they
were
producing.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
to
be
perfectly
frank,
i
should
think
they
might
be
very
willing
to
say
to
the
government
exactly
what
the
government
wanted
to
hear
that
they
were
afraid
of
this
just
standing
in
the
wind.
they
were
apprehensive.
it
did
have
something
to
do
with
their
price
structure.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
i'm
not
convinced
that
when
the
testimony
to
be
educed
that
way
runs
in
favor
of
the
government,
the
government
have
much
concern
with
your
observation.
but
i
do
believe
that
they
could
have
obtained
honest
evidence
no
matter
what
the
thinking
in
the
new
england
beer
industry
was
with
respect
to
the
likelihood
endanger
of
entering
into
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
other
brewers?
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
they
could
be
honest
but
let
me
give
you
a
sample
of
what
is
in
the
record
in
this
case.
it
was
offered
by
the
appellee,
no
testimony
on
this
point
was
offered
by
the
appellant.
mr.
haffenreffer,
who
had
been
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
sales
from
narragansett
for
a
number
of
years
before
the
acquisitions
was
called
by
the
appellees
and
he
was
--
on
page
376,
“what
have
you
to
say
about
the
presence
of
falstaff
in
ohio
on
the
west
and
in
washington
and/or
richmond,
virginia
on
the
south?
what
have
you
to
say
about
the
competitive
effect
of
their
presence
there
(inaudible)?”
answer
-
there
were
no
threat.
we
certainly
didn't
consider
them
any
threat
to
us.
certainly,
at
that
instance,
there
were
no
threat
because
of
transportation
costs.
now,
there
was
a
witness
who
at
that
time
had
no
acts
to
grind,
nothing
at
stake.
he
had
--
he
had
been
a
substantial
stockholder
in
narragansett.
and
when
these
acquisitions
were
consummated,
the
stockholders
in
narragansett
walked
off
with
19
and
half
million
dollars
scot-free.
the
district
court
refused
to
enjoin
the
acquisition
before
it
was
consummated
and
dismissed
narragansett
out
of
this
case
thereafter.
so
at
the
time
mr.
haffenreffer
testified
in
1970,
there
was
no
possible
conflict
of
interest.
he
had
no
acts
to
grind.
he
had
no
concern
with
the
outcome
of
litigation.
that
is
the
only
piece
of
evidence
in
this
record
concerning
the
thinking
of
people
in
the
industry
in
1965
about
the
danger
to
their
position
of
a
possible
entry
by
falstaff.
they
are
eliminated
as
the
potential
competitor
in
that
aspect
of
thing
by
that
piece
of
testimony.
and
the
trial
judge
was
of
course
entitled
to
accept
it
as
true
or
rejected
as
false
and
he
accepted
it
as
true.
with
respect
to
subjective
evidence
if
it
is
admissible,
it
is
initially
at
least
up
to
the
trier
of
fact
to
determine
its
truth
or
falsity.
if
he
finds
it
true,
i
suggest
he
is
entitled
to
find
upon
the
basis
of
its
truth
and
come
to
a
judgment
on
the
case
on
that
basis.
and
unless
the
court
has
changed
its
mind
on
the
view
that
it
had
in
yellow
cab
and
in
oregon
medical
society,
it
will
be
necessary
to
find
that
the
court
below
was
clearly
in
error
and
to
be
convinced
that
a
serious
mistake
has
been
made
by
the
court
below.
what
the
government
is
seeking
here
for
all
the
words
they
used
with
respect
to
incentive
to
falstaff
to
enter
this
market.
what
the
government
is
really
seeking
is
what
it
sought
in
penn-olin
which
is
the
equivalent
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption
from
two
things,
apparent
financial
ability
and
a
desire.
the
desire
does
not
reach
the
heights
of
incentive.
incentive
must
have
with
it
in
the
context
of
things
like
this
a
reasonable
anticipation
of
product.
and
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
by
the
government
of
any
reasonable
anticipation
of
profit.
but
they
used
the
word
incentive
almost
as
though
it
were
the
equal
of
desire
and
with
respect
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
trial
counsel
for
the
government
in
his
opening
said
that
he
would
show
that
for
a
number
of
years
falstaff
have
had
annoying
desire
to
enter
the
new
england
market.
falstaff
had
had
a
desire
to
enter
the
new
england
market
for
a
period
of
years
and
had
never
made
any
attempt
to
conceal
it.
the
question
of
whether
it
could
profit
or
probably
do
it
either
by
independent
entry
or
by
a
toe-hold
series
which
nobody
can
yet
completely
define,
chances
to
profit
entry
in
either
of
those
directions
were
not
acceptable
to
falstaff.
and
they
had
decided
sometime
before
not
to
build
a
brewery
in
new
england
for
example,
a
question
which
i
put
to
mr.
griesedieck
on
page
296
of
the
record.
after
he
had
told
me
it
was
his
view
and
the
unanimous
view
of
the
executive
committee
that
he'd
make
no
attempt
to
enter
independently.
my
question
is
to
pinpoint
this
to
a
degree,
“had
you
ever
entertained
the
idea
in
a
period
of
time
from
approximately
1950
on,
let's
say,
of
building
a
brewery
in
new
england?”
the
answer
was,
“no,
sir.”
i
asked
him,
“why
not?”
and
he
told
me
that
the
--
there
was
no
distributor
system
and
no
observable
way
to
acquire
one.
now,
let
me
speak
of
the
arthur
d.
little
report
very
briefly
because
that
has
been
--
it's
been
suggested
if
that
has
some
significance
with
respect
to
the
likelihood
entry
by
falstaff
independently
or
toe-hold.
the
arthur
d.
little
report
was
a
result
of
a
study
by
engineers
with
respect
to
certain
aspects
of
falstaff's
future,
what
they
should
do?
what
markets
they
should
enter?
how
they
should
try
to
enter
them?
no
live
witness
was
called
in
support
of
those
--
of
that
report.
i
objected
to
it
on
the
ground
that
it
could
not
stand
by
itself
before
its
conclusion.
it
was
omitted.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
whether
the
people
who
made
the
study
and
compose
the
report
and
offer
their
conclusions
and
opinions
in
the
report
itself
had
enough
expertise
to
qualify
the
witness
and
the
report
is
insignificant
because
of
that.
the
report
did
recommend
that
falstaff
build
a
brewery
in
the
baltimore
area
and
falstaff
decided
that
that
part
of
the
report
was
not
valid
enough
to
entertain.
the
report
did
recommend
attempts
to
penetrate
the
detroit-chicago
market.
those
suggestions
falstaff
analyzed
on
its
own
basis
found
they
have
some
merit,
tried
them
out
and
as
i
have
told
you,
failed.
now,
the
critical
part
of
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
burden
which
the
government
had.
it
certainly
--
the
government
certainly
have
to
demonstrate
on
the
one
hand
that
there
was
in
fact
likelihood
of
entry
which
involves
ability
to
finance,
desire
to
entry
and
a
reasonable
profitability
on
penetrating
the
market.
the
government
did
show
desire.
they
showed
apparent
financial
ability,
they
showed
nothing
about
profitability
and
you
cannot
tell
from
the
government's
case
whether
an
entry
in
the
--
either
in
the
method
which
they
suggest
made
any
sense
to
a
prudent
businessman.
and
i
think
it
is
--
seems
like
confident
to
remember
that
this
was
a
public
company,
stock
was
widely
held
and
there
was
some
danger
of
concern,
objection,
and
litigation
on
the
part
of
stockholders
if
they
made
more
blunders
of
the
same
kind
that
they
had
apparently
made
in
both
detroit
and
chicago.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
which
we
produce
showing
the
lack
of
sense
in
entering
the
market
in
the
two
names
suggested
by
the
government.
dr.
horowitz,
we
call
an
expert,
he
testified
was
not
feasible,
not
possible
enough
to
build
a
brewery
and
certainly
not
feasible
without
being
able
to
sell
the
beer.
mr.
haffenreffer
testified
that
he
did
not
believe
that
it
was
possible
for
falstaff
to
acquire
a
viable,
energetic,
reliable,
distribute
organization.
he
did
not
believe
it
was
feasible.
and
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record
which
carry
the
government's
burden
to
its
appropriate
conclusion.
there
are
facts
in
the
record
which
clearly
justify
the
trial
done
in
entering
judgment
for
the
appellee,
if
in
fact,
he
found
the
evidence
credible
and
believed
it.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
after
the
acquisition.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
do
you
say
after
the
acquisition?
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
until
the
judgment
was
entered.
i'm
not
sure
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
been
changed
today.
but
certainly
at
the
point
in
time
when
the
judgment
was
entered,
narragansett
was
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
falstaff
and
had
been
so
since
the
acquisition.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
1965,
july
1965.
and
that
situation
was
maintained
as
a
request
to
the
government
of
falstaff
and
by
agreement
of
falstaff
with
the
government
to
do
it
that
way.
whether
that
has
changed
in
the
meantime,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
represent
falstaff
in
any
other
matter
except
the
matter
which
is
before
you.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
oh
yes,
it
made
attempts
to
sell
falstaff
brand
in
new
england
using
the
distributor
organization
which
he
just
did
in
the
narragansett
operation.
and
the
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
no,
no
indeed.
there
is
a
mimeograph
at
the
end
of
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
which
show
what
happened
to
barrel
sales
of
various
brewers
in
the
period
from
1964
through
1968,
and
it
shows
that
narragansett
was
being
sold
under
its
own
brand
during
that
entire
time.
it
does
not
show
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
no.
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
was
because
the
quantity
of
beer
sold
by
falstaff
didn't
reach
the
bottom
line
of
the
graph.
but
the
fact
is
that
falstaff
brand
was
being
sold
by
narragansett
distributors
and
narragansett
brand
continue
to
be
sold
by
narragansett
distributors
from
the
time
of
the
acquisition
to
the
present
time.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
the
only
information
in
the
record
upon
that
and
they
should
have
adverted
to
this
is
a
testimony
of
mr.
griesedieck
under
examination
by
me.
my
question
was
in
substance,
“have
you
tried
to
exploit
and
promote
diligently
sale
of
falstaff
product
in
this
period
of
time?”
and
his
answer
was
they
have.
i
can
conceive
for
the
government
and
anybody
else
suspecting
that
an
acquisitor
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
might
deliver
a
(inaudible)
and
my
question
was
designed
to
get
into
the
record
evidence
that
they
did
not
do
so,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
interested
in
several
of
the
colloquy
between
counsel
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
the
preceding
case
in
the
court.
one
of
my
interests
lies
in
the
dealing
of
the
government
with
the
subjective
evidence.
at
one
point
in
the
briefing
of
this
case,
a
suggestion
seem
to
me
clearly
was
that
my
subjective
evidence,
the
government
did
not
elect
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
subjective
evidence
should
not
be
admitted
and
indeed
they
made
no
objection
to
the
kind
of
evidence
we
are
talking
about
at
the
trial
level.
nonetheless,
admissible
or
not,
the
court
should
not
take
it
into
account
to
any
degree.
now,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggest,
the
government's
attitude
would
be
quite
different
in
the
subjective
evidence
they
were
thinking.
now,
we
have
the
same
sort
of
problem
in
the
court
below
and
this
is
somewhat
diverting
but
it
is
enlightening,
i
believe
with
respect
to
post-acquisition
evidence.
and
on
page
195
of
the
appendix,
what
trial
counsel
for
the
government
says
in
substance
is
that
in
some
cases,
well
this
is
a
quote,
“in
some
cases,
post-acquisition
evidence
showing
any
competitive
effects
after
an
acquisition
is
relevant.
however,
post-acquisition
evidence
to
show
what
would
have
been
had
this
particular
acquisition
not
taking
place.”
in
other
words,
if
the
evidence
to
be
introduced
was
such
to
show
that
after
an
acquisition
anticompetitive
effects
had
been
felt
in
the
marketplace
that
would
be
admissible.
judge
day
said
it
would
seem
that
a
court
common
justice
would
dictate.
the
evidence
indicated
the
other
way
ought
to
prevent
--
permit
a
defendant
to
introduce
it
and
(inaudible)
and
apply
the
merge.
now
that's
the
same
matter
to
the
government
has
about
subjective
evidence
and
let
me
turn
to
the
subjective
evidence
and
speak
upon
it.
while
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
clearly
suggest
and
i
know
of
no
contrary
decision
that
it
does
not
deem
its
function
to
retry
cases
and
will
not
do
it.
whether
examination
is
into
that
question
of
whether
the
findings
below
were
clearly
erroneous,
the
discussion
have
got
to
run
the
gamut
of
significant
evidence.
now,
the
evidence
that
were
talking
about
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
that
is
not
the
entire
standard
he
applied.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
he
referred
to
that
as
significant.
what
he
says
about
it
in
the
broad
is
incredible
evidence
establishes
and
it
was
not
a
potential
entrant
into
said
market,
by
any
means
or
way
other
than
by
said
acquisition.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
he
doesn't
--
that
is
correct.
he
does
not
refer
the
question
of
whether
fact
a
or
fact
b
leads
him
to
that
conclusion.
however
in
the
record
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
both
facets
have
some
significance
if
they
both
exist
that
is
the
likelihood
of
entry
and
the
apprehension
in
the
industry,
in
the
market.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
there
was
no
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
--
evidence
of
any
kind
that
that
apprehension
existed,
none
whatever.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
you
can't
from
the
record
pinpoint
it.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
things
that
i'm
talking
about
are
in
the
records
and
the
things
--
some
of
the
things
which
we
have
just
talked
about
a
moment
two
ago
are
not.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
evidence
offered
by
the
government
that
the
industry
in
the
new
england
market
had
any
apprehension
that
falstaff
would
enter
the
market.
and
there
was
therefore
no
threat
by
virtue
of
their
being
400
miles
away
which
the
government
suggested
in
new
england.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
if
there
were
any
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
there
are
no
facts
about
the
profitability
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
--
of
any
entry
which
could've
been
made
by
falstaff.
now
the
government
started
this
case
in
1965.
it
took
a
large
quantity
of
depositions.
it
sought
answers
to
a
large
quantity
of
interrogatories.
it
served
upon
falstaff
before
the
acquisition,
for
the
consummation
of
the
acquisition,
cid,
seeking
extensive
information.
after
the
commencement
of
the
suit,
it
took
extensive
depositions.
now
i
had
it
chosen
to
try
and
show
state
of
mind
of
the
industry
in
new
england
with
respect
to
the
threat
of
entry
by
falstaff,
there
were
large
quantity
of
witnesses
who
could
have
been
interrogated
on
this
point
other
members
of
the
industry.
and
i
suggest
to
some
evidence
of
that
kind
is
essential.
i
see
no
way,
no
reasonable
way
of
suggesting
but
that
in
the
industry,
one
competitor
who
does
not
know
something
about
what
another
possible
competitor
is
doing
and
thinking.
now,
the
reason
behind,
i'm
having
to
mixed
these
things
up
in
part,
but
the
reason
behind,
the
determination
of
falstaff
management,
not
to
enter
new
england
market
either
independently
or
by
what
is
referred
to
as
a
toe-hold
entry,
whatever
that
mean,
laying
the
fact
that
they
had
attempted
to
enter
the
detroit
market.
they
had
attempted
to
penetrate
chicago
market.
they
being
in
the
north
--
in
north
--
northern
california,
attempted
to
penetrate
the
southern
california
market.
and
in
each
case,
those
attempts
were
dismal
failures.
and
they
were
dismal
failures
so
mr.
griesedieck
testified
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
not
in
fact
when
they
went
into
these
areas
a
healthy
distributor
organization
and
in
at
least
one
of
them,
their
attempt
to
create
one
after
entering
the
market
were
a
failure.
and
their
conclusions
were
that
they'll
make
no
attempt
to
enter
a
market
thereafter.
this
occurred
before
1964,
1965.
they
would
make
no
attempts
to
penetrate
the
market
unless
they
knew
that
they
had
a
distributor
organization
which
was
energetic,
healthy,
and
which
promise
to
be
able
to
sell
the
product
which
they
were
producing.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
to
be
perfectly
frank,
i
should
think
they
might
be
very
willing
to
say
to
the
government
exactly
what
the
government
wanted
to
hear
that
they
were
afraid
of
this
just
standing
in
the
wind.
they
were
apprehensive.
it
did
have
something
to
do
with
their
price
structure.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
i'm
not
convinced
that
when
the
testimony
to
be
educed
that
way
runs
in
favor
of
the
government,
the
government
have
much
concern
with
your
observation.
but
i
do
believe
that
they
could
have
obtained
honest
evidence
no
matter
what
the
thinking
in
the
new
england
beer
industry
was
with
respect
to
the
likelihood
endanger
of
entering
into
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
other
brewers?
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
they
could
be
honest
but
let
me
give
you
a
sample
of
what
is
in
the
record
in
this
case.
it
was
offered
by
the
appellee,
no
testimony
on
this
point
was
offered
by
the
appellant.
mr.
haffenreffer,
who
had
been
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
sales
from
narragansett
for
a
number
of
years
before
the
acquisitions
was
called
by
the
appellees
and
he
was
--
on
page
376,
“what
have
you
to
say
about
the
presence
of
falstaff
in
ohio
on
the
west
and
in
washington
and/or
richmond,
virginia
on
the
south?
what
have
you
to
say
about
the
competitive
effect
of
their
presence
there
(inaudible)?”
answer
-
there
were
no
threat.
we
certainly
didn't
consider
them
any
threat
to
us.
certainly,
at
that
instance,
there
were
no
threat
because
of
transportation
costs.
now,
there
was
a
witness
who
at
that
time
had
no
acts
to
grind,
nothing
at
stake.
he
had
--
he
had
been
a
substantial
stockholder
in
narragansett.
and
when
these
acquisitions
were
consummated,
the
stockholders
in
narragansett
walked
off
with
19
and
half
million
dollars
scot-free.
the
district
court
refused
to
enjoin
the
acquisition
before
it
was
consummated
and
dismissed
narragansett
out
of
this
case
thereafter.
so
at
the
time
mr.
haffenreffer
testified
in
1970,
there
was
no
possible
conflict
of
interest.
he
had
no
acts
to
grind.
he
had
no
concern
with
the
outcome
of
litigation.
that
is
the
only
piece
of
evidence
in
this
record
concerning
the
thinking
of
people
in
the
industry
in
1965
about
the
danger
to
their
position
of
a
possible
entry
by
falstaff.
they
are
eliminated
as
the
potential
competitor
in
that
aspect
of
thing
by
that
piece
of
testimony.
and
the
trial
judge
was
of
course
entitled
to
accept
it
as
true
or
rejected
as
false
and
he
accepted
it
as
true.
with
respect
to
subjective
evidence
if
it
is
admissible,
it
is
initially
at
least
up
to
the
trier
of
fact
to
determine
its
truth
or
falsity.
if
he
finds
it
true,
i
suggest
he
is
entitled
to
find
upon
the
basis
of
its
truth
and
come
to
a
judgment
on
the
case
on
that
basis.
and
unless
the
court
has
changed
its
mind
on
the
view
that
it
had
in
yellow
cab
and
in
oregon
medical
society,
it
will
be
necessary
to
find
that
the
court
below
was
clearly
in
error
and
to
be
convinced
that
a
serious
mistake
has
been
made
by
the
court
below.
what
the
government
is
seeking
here
for
all
the
words
they
used
with
respect
to
incentive
to
falstaff
to
enter
this
market.
what
the
government
is
really
seeking
is
what
it
sought
in
penn-olin
which
is
the
equivalent
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption
from
two
things,
apparent
financial
ability
and
a
desire.
the
desire
does
not
reach
the
heights
of
incentive.
incentive
must
have
with
it
in
the
context
of
things
like
this
a
reasonable
anticipation
of
product.
and
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
by
the
government
of
any
reasonable
anticipation
of
profit.
but
they
used
the
word
incentive
almost
as
though
it
were
the
equal
of
desire
and
with
respect
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
trial
counsel
for
the
government
in
his
opening
said
that
he
would
show
that
for
a
number
of
years
falstaff
have
had
annoying
desire
to
enter
the
new
england
market.
falstaff
had
had
a
desire
to
enter
the
new
england
market
for
a
period
of
years
and
had
never
made
any
attempt
to
conceal
it.
the
question
of
whether
it
could
profit
or
probably
do
it
either
by
independent
entry
or
by
a
toe-hold
series
which
nobody
can
yet
completely
define,
chances
to
profit
entry
in
either
of
those
directions
were
not
acceptable
to
falstaff.
and
they
had
decided
sometime
before
not
to
build
a
brewery
in
new
england
for
example,
a
question
which
i
put
to
mr.
griesedieck
on
page
296
of
the
record.
after
he
had
told
me
it
was
his
view
and
the
unanimous
view
of
the
executive
committee
that
he'd
make
no
attempt
to
enter
independently.
my
question
is
to
pinpoint
this
to
a
degree,
“had
you
ever
entertained
the
idea
in
a
period
of
time
from
approximately
1950
on,
let's
say,
of
building
a
brewery
in
new
england?”
the
answer
was,
“no,
sir.”
i
asked
him,
“why
not?”
and
he
told
me
that
the
--
there
was
no
distributor
system
and
no
observable
way
to
acquire
one.
now,
let
me
speak
of
the
arthur
d.
little
report
very
briefly
because
that
has
been
--
it's
been
suggested
if
that
has
some
significance
with
respect
to
the
likelihood
entry
by
falstaff
independently
or
toe-hold.
the
arthur
d.
little
report
was
a
result
of
a
study
by
engineers
with
respect
to
certain
aspects
of
falstaff's
future,
what
they
should
do?
what
markets
they
should
enter?
how
they
should
try
to
enter
them?
no
live
witness
was
called
in
support
of
those
--
of
that
report.
i
objected
to
it
on
the
ground
that
it
could
not
stand
by
itself
before
its
conclusion.
it
was
omitted.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
whether
the
people
who
made
the
study
and
compose
the
report
and
offer
their
conclusions
and
opinions
in
the
report
itself
had
enough
expertise
to
qualify
the
witness
and
the
report
is
insignificant
because
of
that.
the
report
did
recommend
that
falstaff
build
a
brewery
in
the
baltimore
area
and
falstaff
decided
that
that
part
of
the
report
was
not
valid
enough
to
entertain.
the
report
did
recommend
attempts
to
penetrate
the
detroit-chicago
market.
those
suggestions
falstaff
analyzed
on
its
own
basis
found
they
have
some
merit,
tried
them
out
and
as
i
have
told
you,
failed.
now,
the
critical
part
of
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
burden
which
the
government
had.
it
certainly
--
the
government
certainly
have
to
demonstrate
on
the
one
hand
that
there
was
in
fact
likelihood
of
entry
which
involves
ability
to
finance,
desire
to
entry
and
a
reasonable
profitability
on
penetrating
the
market.
the
government
did
show
desire.
they
showed
apparent
financial
ability,
they
showed
nothing
about
profitability
and
you
cannot
tell
from
the
government's
case
whether
an
entry
in
the
--
either
in
the
method
which
they
suggest
made
any
sense
to
a
prudent
businessman.
and
i
think
it
is
--
seems
like
confident
to
remember
that
this
was
a
public
company,
stock
was
widely
held
and
there
was
some
danger
of
concern,
objection,
and
litigation
on
the
part
of
stockholders
if
they
made
more
blunders
of
the
same
kind
that
they
had
apparently
made
in
both
detroit
and
chicago.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
which
we
produce
showing
the
lack
of
sense
in
entering
the
market
in
the
two
names
suggested
by
the
government.
dr.
horowitz,
we
call
an
expert,
he
testified
was
not
feasible,
not
possible
enough
to
build
a
brewery
and
certainly
not
feasible
without
being
able
to
sell
the
beer.
mr.
haffenreffer
testified
that
he
did
not
believe
that
it
was
possible
for
falstaff
to
acquire
a
viable,
energetic,
reliable,
distribute
organization.
he
did
not
believe
it
was
feasible.
and
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record
which
carry
the
government's
burden
to
its
appropriate
conclusion.
there
are
facts
in
the
record
which
clearly
justify
the
trial
done
in
entering
judgment
for
the
appellee,
if
in
fact,
he
found
the
evidence
credible
and
believed
it.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
after
the
acquisition.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
do
you
say
after
the
acquisition?
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
until
the
judgment
was
entered.
i'm
not
sure
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
been
changed
today.
but
certainly
at
the
point
in
time
when
the
judgment
was
entered,
narragansett
was
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
falstaff
and
had
been
so
since
the
acquisition.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
1965,
july
1965.
and
that
situation
was
maintained
as
a
request
to
the
government
of
falstaff
and
by
agreement
of
falstaff
with
the
government
to
do
it
that
way.
whether
that
has
changed
in
the
meantime,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
represent
falstaff
in
any
other
matter
except
the
matter
which
is
before
you.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
oh
yes,
it
made
attempts
to
sell
falstaff
brand
in
new
england
using
the
distributor
organization
which
he
just
did
in
the
narragansett
operation.
and
the
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
no,
no
indeed.
there
is
a
mimeograph
at
the
end
of
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
which
show
what
happened
to
barrel
sales
of
various
brewers
in
the
period
from
1964
through
1968,
and
it
shows
that
narragansett
was
being
sold
under
its
own
brand
during
that
entire
time.
it
does
not
show
--
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
no.
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
was
because
the
quantity
of
beer
sold
by
falstaff
didn't
reach
the
bottom
line
of
the
graph.
but
the
fact
is
that
falstaff
brand
was
being
sold
by
narragansett
distributors
and
narragansett
brand
continue
to
be
sold
by
narragansett
distributors
from
the
time
of
the
acquisition
to
the
present
time.
mr.
matthew
w.
goring
the
only
information
in
the
record
upon
that
and
they
should
have
adverted
to
this
is
a
testimony
of
mr.
griesedieck
under
examination
by
me.
my
question
was
in
substance,
“have
you
tried
to
exploit
and
promote
diligently
sale
of
falstaff
product
in
this
period
of
time?”
and
his
answer
was
they
have.
i
can
conceive
for
the
government
and
anybody
else
suspecting
that
an
acquisitor
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
might
deliver
a
(inaudible)
and
my
question
was
designed
to
get
into
the
record
evidence
that
they
did
not
do
so,
your
honor.
