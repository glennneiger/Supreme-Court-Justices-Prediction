mr.
kauper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
from
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
rhode
island
dismissing
the
government's
complaint
with
the
antitrust
laws
against
the
falstaff
brewing
company.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
1965
acquisition
by
falstaff
brewing
corporation,
the
nation's
fourth
largest
brewer
of
the
assets
of
the
narragansett
brewing
company,
the
largest
brewer
in
new
england
violates
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended.
like
greeley,
the
preceding
case
on
the
docket,
it
is
a
potential
competition
case.
central
to
the
case
is
the
need
to
halt
and
if
possible
to
reverse
the
increasing
trend
towards
concentration
in
the
brewing
industry
in
local
markets,
a
trend
which
was
both
noted
with
concern
and
was
the
primary
basis
for
this
court's
1966
holding
in
united
states
against
pabst
brewing
company.
the
market
in
this
case
is
not
in
dispute,
it
is
stipulated,
it
is
the
production
and
sale
of
beer
in
the
new
england
area
comprised
of
the
six
new
england
states.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
case
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
there
was
any
direct
competition
between
falstaff
and
narragansett.
the
government
alleged
rather
that
falstaff
was
a
significant
potential
competitor
in
this
market
that
the
market
was
concentrated
and
becoming
increasingly
so
and
that
the
net
effect
of
its
elimination
as
a
potential
competitor
therefore
substantially
lessened
competition
within
the
meaning
of
section
7.
more
particularly,
the
government
alleged
that
falstaff
had
the
incentive
to
enter
--
it
had
the
financial
capability
to
enter.
it
had
reasonable
prospects
for
a
successful
de
novo
or
toe-hold
entry.
the
district
court
relying
on
two
findings
dismissed
the
government's
complaint.
more
specifically,
the
court
concluded
that
falstaff's
management
had
considered
the
acquisition
by
other
means,
find
them
unprofitable,
and
that
therefore,
the
decision
was
made
by
falstaff
not
to
enter
this
market
by
any
means
other
than
the
acquisition
of
narragansett.
mr.
kauper
no.
mr.
kauper
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
government's
theory
is
it
was
one
of
the
most
likely
entrants.
mr.
kauper
more
specifically,
if
i'm
right,
the
allegation
and
the
evidence
submitted
would
tend
to
indicate
that
it
is
one
of
the
nation's
10
largest
brewers.
seven
of
those
brewers
are
already
in
the
new
england
market.
mr.
kauper
two
of
them
--
well,
i
don't
know
who
had
said
they
were
way
out
west
but
they
were
significantly
further
west
than
falstaff
and
they
are
also
significantly
smaller
than
falstaff.
mr.
kauper
i
believe
that
was
the
case.
i
don't
think
we
would
have
to
establish
that
it
was
absolutely
the
only
one
that
could
do
so.
mr.
kauper
yes,
i
think
if
--
if
the
evidence
were
to
demonstrate
that
there
were
very
large
number
of
potential
entrants,
then
clearly
one
would
have
to
take
the
position
elimination
of
one
had
no
particular
impact.
mr.
kauper
i
think
that
essentially
is
correct,
yes.
so
that
its
elimination
had
some
consequence,
otherwise
clearly
it
would
not.
the
court
below,
we
believe
misconceived
standards
which
are
to
be
applied
in
this
sort
of
a
case,
more
particularly
in
its
two
key
holdings,
we
believe
that
it
improperly
relied
upon
subjective
statements
made
after
the
fact
as
to
what
the
intentions
of
falstaff's
management
would
have
been
at
a
previous
point
in
time.
second,
we
believe
that
it
failed
to
recognize
the
concentrated
nature
of
the
market
in
the
new
england
area.
in
finding
that,
this
particular
market
was
“intensely
competitive”.
finally,
we
believe
it
put
undue
weight
upon
certain
post-acquisition
evidence
which
tended
to
indicate
that
following
the
acquisition
by
falstaff,
narragansett's
market
share
declined.
let
me
now
briefly
deal
with
the
facts.
the
new
england
beer
market,
first
of
all,
is
a
growing
market
sales
--
total
sales
increased
by
9.5%
during
the
period
from
1960
to
1964.
in
1960,
the
top
eight
firms
in
the
market
controlled
74%
of
the
sales,
by
1964,
that
figure
was
81%.
in
1960,
the
top
four
firms
controlled
50%
of
the
market,
the
top
four
firms
in
1965,
61.3%
of
the
market.
in
the
seven
years
preceding
the
acquisition,
the
number
of
brewers
operating
plants
in
new
england
declined
from
11
to
6.
in
short,
we
believe
that
this
evidence
carefully
tracks
the
same
trends
which
were
noted
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
pabst
brewing
company
in
1966.
the
increasing
trend
towards
concentration,
the
decline
in
number
of
brewers
is
approximately
the
same.
we
also,
as
i
indicated,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
facts
are
indicated
that
there
are
10
--
of
the
10
largest
brewers
in
the
nation,
seven
are
already
marketing
in
the
new
england
area.
the
remaining
three
--
of
the
remaining
three,
falstaff
is
clearly
the
largest,
it
is
also
the
one
most
geographically
proximate
to
the
new
england
market
although
i
think
we
would
all
recognize
that
it's
not
within,
let's
suppose,
a
hundred
mile.
the
market
is
characterized
as
is
the
marketing
at
most
beer
by
heavy
promotional
and
advertising
expenditure.
the
narragansett
brewing
company
acquired
by
falstaff
at
the
time
of
acquisition
was
the
leading
brewer
in
terms
of
sales
in
the
new
england
area
with
approximately
20%
of
the
market.
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
a
healthy
firm,
its
profits
and
sales
had
increased
substantially
during
the
four
years
prior
to
the
acquisition.
it
had
engaged
in
significant
planned
expansion
and
indeed
inquired
--
acquired
certain
assets
from
certain
other
brewers
during
that
same
period.
its
distribution
system
was
primarily
through
independent
wholesale
distributors.
they
were
not
bound
by
contract
to
narragansett,
to
handle
narragansett's
beer
exclusively
and
indeed
the
evidence
suggest
than
in
most
instances
they
did
not.
the
falstaff
brewing
company,
the
acquiring
corporation,
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
was
the
fourth
largest
brewer
in
the
united
states
having
5.9%
of
the
market.
it
at
that
time
operated
eight
breweries.
most
of
those
breweries
had
been
acquired
by
falstaff
during
a
20-year
period.
in
most
instance,
there
were
small
failing
breweries
of
capacities
of
some
hundred,
two
hundred
thousand
barrels.
in
each
instance,
falstaff
had
substantially
modernized
those
plants,
had
greatly
expanded
their
capacity,
and
in
that
manner,
had
developed
the
system
which
made
them,
by
1965,
the
fourth
largest
brewer
in
the
nation.
during
the
period
preceding
--
immediately
preceding
the
acquisition,
falstaff's
sales
and
profits
had
also
expanded
greatly.
it
was
a
financially
healthy
company.
it
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
capital.
falstaff
distributed
its
beer
in
two
ways.
approximately
80%
of
its
beer
in
various
markets
was
distributed
through
independent
wholesale
distributors.
most
of
those
distributors
were
non-exclusive
distributors.
i
think
the
figure
is
something
like
75%
of
the
total
wholesale
distributors
did
not
carry
falstaff's
line
exclusively.
the
balance
of
its
beer
was
distributed
through
its
own
owned
branch
operations.
now
that
was
true
in
cities
where
it
operated
breweries.
it
was
also
true
in
the
number
of
cities
in
california.
so
that
it
was
experienced
with
at
least
two
types
of
distribution
system
namely
the
independent
wholesale
distributor
as
well
as
the
branch
distributor
which
it
owned.
so
far
as
entry
is
concerned,
falstaff
had
conceived
or
perceived
by
--
that
national
breweries
and
you
had
mr.
metzger
in
the
previous
case
referred
to
probably
the
four
best
known
international
brewers,
by
virtue
of
their
national
status
had
certain
competitive
advantages
over
falstaff.
this
includes
the
ability
to
advertise
on
a
national
basis
and
what
is
referred
to
as
the
so-called
prestige
factor.
in
fact,
an
individual
who
goes
in
to
buy
a
can
or
a
bottle
of
beer,
he
gets
accustomed
to
a
particular
brand
which
he
can
find
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
in
1958,
falstaff
commissioned
a
report
to
be
made
ahead
on
its
future
growth.
that
report
is
referred
to
throughout
the
record
as
the
arthur
d.
little
report
which
was
submitted
to
falstaff
in
1960.
that
report
was
designed
to
indicate
the
method
of
growth
for
the
falstaff
brewing
company
in
the
years
to
come.
it
made
a
number
of
recommendations
but
i'd
--
let
me
refer
to
three.
first,
it
rather
clearly
and
categorically
stated
that
if
falstaff
was
to
expand
its
sales,
it
would
need
to
become
a
national
brewer,
but
national
brewer
status.
second,
it
recommended
that
entry
be
made
into
new
markets
by
the
building
of
new
brewers.
specifically,
in
the
context
of
our
case,
it
suggested
that
--
excuse
me
--
falstaff
should
enter
into
the
new
england
market
--
pardon,
the
northeastern
market
by
the
building
of
a
new
brewery,
which
was
to
be
located
in
baltimore,
maryland.
but
more
generally,
it
concluded
that
building
of
a
new
brewery
was
more
economical
than
entry
by
other
means.
it
also
indicated
that
distribution
by
falstaff
through
its
own
company-owned
outlets
was
more
profitable
to
falstaff
than
entry
--
pardon
me,
distribution
through
the
use
of
independent
distributors.
following
a
receipt
of
that
report,
falstaff
began
through
public
pronouncement
and
otherwise
to
indicate
its
desire
to
become
a
national
brewery.
foremost
among
its
desires
was
an
entry
into
the
northeastern
market.
in
pursuing
that
particular
goal,
it
had
negotiations
with
several
other
brewers
before
culmination
of
the
acquisition
of
narragansett.
these
brewers
--
i
think
it
--
must
be
indicated
that
at
least
in
several
instances
came
to
narragansett
and
not
came
to
falstaff
and
not
the
other
way
around,
but
there
were
extended
negotiations
with
the
liebmann
brewing
company.
there
were
extended
negotiations
with
rheingold
brewers.
these
are
both
brewers
operating
primarily
or
have
brewing
headquarters
in
new
york
--
in
the
new
york
city
area
but
marketing
in
the
new
england
area.
employees
were
sent
to
visit
the
plants
of
the
piel
brewery,
plants
both
in
new
york
and
massachusetts.
there
were
contacts
made
with
other
brewers
in
the
upstate
new
york
area
and
indeed
contacts
inquiries
made
of
falstaff
by
several
smaller
brewers,
at
least
two,
pardon
me,
in
the
new
england
areas.
now
it's
in
that
setting
that
the
government
contends
that
the
acquisition
of
narragansett
by
falstaff
eliminated
a
significant
potential
competitor
from
this
market.
falstaff
does
not,
as
we
understand
it,
deny
that
it
had
the
capability,
financial,
technical
capability
to
enter
the
new
england
market,
nor
does
it
deny
at
least
in
general
--
in
general
that
it
had
a
strong
incentive
to
enter
the
northeastern
market.
it
does
not
assert
as
out
far
as
we
can
tell
that
there
were
any
other
brewers
who
are
more
likely
to
enter
into
the
new
england
market.
its
essential
argument
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
it
could
not
enter
this
market
other
than
by
its
acquisition
of
the
narragansett
brewing
company
because
and
this
was
the
basis
defining
by
the
district
court,
statements
made
by
its
executives
that
it
was
necessary
to
secure
a
strong,
viable
distribution
system
to
enter
the
northeastern
market
and
that
kind
of
system
could
be
obtained
only
through
the
acquisition
of
narragansett.
hence,
i
think
the
issue
in
a
large
part
comes
down
to
the
criteria
by
which
one
identifies
a
potential
competitor
in
a
given
market.
that
is
in
a
sense
issue
one.
second
of
all,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
falstaff
also
contends
that
this
market
was
in
fact
intensely
competitive.
now
i
take
it
that
the
relevance
of
that
is
that
if
the
market
was
intensely
competitive
before
the
acquisition,
intensely
competitive
after
the
acquisition,
the
elimination
of
the
significant
potential
competitor
in
and
of
itself
would
not
materially
hold
the
competition
in
the
marketplace,
and
hence
under
those
circumstances,
we
should
not
be
concerned
about
the
question
whether
falstaff
is
such
a
significant
potential
competitor.
now
in
general,
i
don't
think
after
the
discussion
yesterday
we
need
to
review
in
detail
the
theory
of
a
potential
competition
case.
in
essence,
it
has
two
parts,
one
is
that
the
particular
firm,
the
acquiring
firm
in
this
instance
was
in
fact
likely
to
enter
the
market
and
that
this
because
of
the
concentrated
nature
of
the
market
would
be
pro-competitive.
that
is
it
is
in
fact
a
likely
entrant.
second
part
of
the
theory
says
in
essence
that
its
presence
as
a
potential
competitor
is
likely
to
have
had
an
impact
on
the
behavior
of
firms
already
in
the
market.
and
it
is
that
impact
which
is
then
eliminated
through
its
entry
of
a
brewer,
particularly
of
the
size
of
this
particular
firm,
narragansett.
indeed,
in
the
cases
decided
by
this
court,
dealing
with
potential
competition,
there
appears
to
be
--
appears
to
have
been
more
emphasis
on
the
latter
than
on
the
former.
those
cases,
the
el
paso
case,
the
penn-olin
case,
procter
&
gamble,
ford
motor
case
decided
last
term,
all
emphasize
the
effect
which
that
particular
acquiring
firm
had
on
the
market
even
without
actual
entry,
but
instead
by
virtue
of
its
existence,
and
the
phrase
which
has
come
to
be
used
is
on
the
wings
of
the
market.
as
it
was
put
in
the
panel,
the
existence
of
an
aggressive,
well-equipped,
and
well-financed
corporation
engaged
in
the
same
or
related
lines
of
commerce
waiting
anxiously
to
enter
an
oligopolistic
market
would
be
a
substantial
incentive
to
competition.
now
that's
the
basic
theory.
mr.
kauper
yes.
mr.
kauper
well
obviously,
there
is
a
factual
question,
but
it
was
one
thing
in
any
case
of
this
sort,
but
i
think
the
question
is
what
is
it
that
the
facts
have
to
show?
our
contention
in
this
case
is
what
the
facts
have
to
show
is
that
there
was
a
substantial
incentive
to
enter,
that
there
was
capability
to
enter,
that
there
were
reasonable
prospects
for
entry
and
that
to
a
reasonable
improving
management,
there
was
such
an
opportunity
to
enter.
mr.
kauper
well
i
think
the
court
dealt
to
some
extent
that
same
question
yesterday.
they
questioned
what
is
subjective,
what
is
objective.
i
think
in
the
sense
of
are
they
anxious,
that
may
not
be
best
term
to
use.
it
is
of
course,
i
recognized
that
the
term
used
by
the
court.
but
what
it
suggests
is
a
firm
which
is
positioned
at
a
certain
point
in
the
market.
and
because
of
that
position,
that
firm
when
eliminated,
brings
about
an
anticompetitive
effect.
now
i
think
so
far
as
what
is
subjective,
what
is
objective
and
that
is
indeed
the
major
part
of
what
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case.
let
me
if
i
might
turn
to
that
because
there
were
some
discussions
of
that
yesterday.
i
think
the
question
which
was
put
yesterday
is
this
simply
a
matter
of
trying
--
retrying
the
facts
of
this
case
cannot
be
put
in
quite
those
terms
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
trying
to
decide
what
it
is
the
facts
have
to
show.
it
is
not
a
question
of
do
the
facts
show
that
this
firm
would
or
would
not
in
fact
have
entered.
instead,
the
government's
contention
is
that
the
court
should
apply
here
criteria
which
are
objective
and
structural
in
nature.
and
having
applied
those
criteria,
we
believe
the
government
has
met
its
burden
on
this
case.
mr.
kauper
our
--
in
our
judgment,
the
ultimately
--
ultimate
factual
inquiry,
let
me
put
it
in
several
parts
because
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
several
issues
although
in
a
sense
we're
really
only
talking
about
one.
obviously
number
one,
is
this
a
--
is
it
a
concentrated
mark.
and
i
--
that's
not
the
point
we
are
talking
about
now.
number
two,
is
a
question
of
how
many
entrants
might
there
be.
is
this
a
peculiar
entrant
or
one
of
a
group
peculiarly
like
(inaudible)
but
so
far
as
the
question
of
entry
itself
is
our
belief
and
we
believe
the
court
has
already
so
indicated
that
the
standard
to
be
applied
is
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
management
on
the
facts
established
would
have
believed
there
was
a
basis
for
entry
if
this
acquisition
had
been
prohibited.
now
--
mr.
kauper
i
think
we
would
be
prepared
to
make
that
argument.
now
in
this
case,
mr.
justice,
i
think
we
would
also
contend
that
the
particular
fact
on
which
that
finding
was
based
really
was
not
--
i'm
taking
that
particular
finding,
was
not
based
on
evidence
which
show
what
that
management
had
in
fact
done
in
the
year
1964
and
1965.
in
other
words,
i
think
there
is
a
second
part
to
the
problem
in
this
case
because
the
testimony
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
president
of
falstaff
in
particular,
his
testimony
given
in
a
much
later
date
as
to
what
he
would
have
done
or
would
not
have
done,
what
other
in
the
management
of
falstaff
would
or
would
not
have
done.
but
the
testimony
being
given
on
the
later
date
has
some
of
the
aspects
obviously
of
the
self-serving
state.
mr.
kauper
no,
i
don't
think
i
would
say
it
should
have
disbelieved.
i
think
the
argument
we
are
making
is
that
because
of
the
nature
of
that
evidence,
it
should
not
be
the
governing
criterion
at
all.
now,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
an
issue
of
credibility
of
that
statement
in
a
case
by
case
sort
of
basis.
but
the
standard
should
be
drawn
so
that
that
statement
is
really
not
the
crucial
issue.
i
don't
know
whether
i
have
made
that
point
but
it
seems
to
me,
when
you
say
is
it
a
matter
of
should
it
be
believed
or
should
not
be
believed,
i
think
that
the
ideal
standard
would
be
a
situation
in
which
you
did
not
put
a
man
on
the
stand
and
say
to
him,
“what
would
you
have
done
three
or
four
years
ago?”
mr.
kauper
yes.
i
think
that's
not
quite
the
point
i
am
dealing
with
here.
i
think
there
are
two
points.
one
is,
i
would
not
approach
this
as
a
standard
which
is
based
upon
testimony
given
in
a
later
fact.
now,
your
question
which
goes
to
anxiously
waiting
could
also
go
to
the
use
of
subjective
evidence
which
is
contemporaneous
with
the
evidence
but
it
just
seems
to
me
there
are
two
parts
to
this
particular
problem.
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
relied
upon
statements
of
the
management
that
they
would
not
have
entered
in
any
other
manner
other
than
the
acquisition
of
narragansett.
that
is
testimony
taken
at
a
later
point
in
time.
mr.
kauper
that's
correct.
mr.
kauper
well,
i
take
it
--
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
while.
i
take
it,
what
you
are
suggesting
is
perhaps
what
we
should
do
in
this
case
is
put
the
actual
members
of
the
industry
on
the
--
on
the
stand.
mr.
kauper
well,
i
–
mr.
kauper
yes.
mr.
kauper
yes.
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
question
of
impact
whether
we
call
it
on
the
wings
or
on
the
edge
or
whatever
words
they
use,
almost
already
in
the
market
is
a
matter
and
i
think
this
is
your
point
of
the
perceptions
of
those
within
the
industry.
that
is
one
reason
why
we
think
a
statement
made
after
the
fact
as
to
what
a
firm's
intention
would
have
been
is
not
the
criteria
to
be
applied
in
such
a
case.
obviously,
that
is
not
perceived
by
those
who
are
already
members
of
the
industry.
i
think
our
position
on
your
question
would
be
if
the
facts
in
the
record
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
basis
for
entry
which
would
have
been
acceptable
to
reasonable
man,
that
that
justifies
the
belief
that
others
would
have
perceived
the
same
thing.
mr.
kauper
well,
i
think
mr.
justice,
there
may
be
a
case
where
it
is
precisely
the
question
of
actual
entry.
that
is,
there
could
conceivably
be
again
where
a
firm
has
no
impact
on
the
wings,
so
to
speak,
but
where
in
fact
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
it
would
have
entered.
mr.
kauper
yes,
i
believe
there
could
be.
mr.
kauper
yes.
i'm
nearing
it
--
mr.
kauper
i
believe
that's
right.
i'm
nearing
the
end
of
time
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
i
reserve
the
balance
--
mr.
kauper
let
me
address
myself
to
several
matters
raised
in
the
argument
of
counsel.
he
suggested
there
was
no
evidence
of
apprehension
within
the
new
england
market
on
the
part
of
those
in
the
market
of
the
likelihood
of
entry
by
falstaff.
i
think
it
should
be
indicated,
number
one,
that
the
testimony
of
mr.
haffenreffer
which
he
read
to
you
of
course
says
he
did
not
fear
them
because
of
their
transportation
cost.
we
are
not
talking
about
their
entry
through
transportation.
but
i
think
more
important,
there
is
an
impressive
list
of
concerns
marketing
in
new
england
who
contacted
this
particular
brewing
company
with
respect
to
likelihood
of
acquisition,
not
only
the
majors
which
are
referred
to
be
--
primarily
in
the
brief,
but
several
smaller
brewers
contacted
the
falstaff
brewing
company
as
a
firm
whom
they
believe
would
be
likely
to
enter.
the
letters
from
distributors
which
are
contained
in
the
record,
some
20
of
them
already
existing
beer
distributors
simply
elude
to
the
rumors
in
the
likelihood
that
falstaff
was
preparing
to
enter
this
market.
and
now
it's
true
there
is
no
testimony
by
competitors
that
their
conduct
was
influenced
by
this
individual
firm
on
the
edge
in
the
market.
it
is
quite
clear
however
they
were
perceived
by
those
in
the
industry
as
a
rather
likely
entry.
mr.
kauper
are
you
talking
about
chief
executive
officer?
mr.
kauper
well,
i
think
that
--
that
what
mr.
haffenreffer
said
as
i
understand
it
is
that
during
the
time
that
he
was
operating
the
narragansett
brewery
he
did
not
fear
and
as
--
maybe
i
read
the
statement
incorrect,
“shipment
into
the
area
by
falstaff.
he
puts
it
specifically
in
terms
of
transportation.”
now
it
maybe
that
at
that
point
there
was
no
particular
likelihood
of
that
sort
of
conduct.
but
i
think
given
the
objective
facts
here
with
respect
to
the
likelihood
of
entry
and
the
perception
of
falstaff's
entry
by
those
in
the
industry
and
given
the
concentrated
nature
of
this
market
that
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
their
behavior
was
affected
by
this
particular
firm.
now,
i
think
and
let
me
turn
to
that
issue
because
we
really
did
not
discuss
it
earlier.
the
second
critical
finding
i
think
made
by
the
judge
and
there
are
some
difficulties
here
because
the
judge
made
no
detail
of
findings
of
fact
is
that
the
market
was
intensely
competitive.
now,
if
that
is
so,
presumably
the
elimination
of
the
significant
potential
competitor
is
a
very
little
customer.
nowhere
in
his
opinion
does
he
refer
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
concentrated
market.
nowhere
does
he
refer
to
the
fact
that
that
trend
was
increasing.
he
accepts
primarily
the
testimony
by
falstaff's
president,
the
chief
executive
officer
of
narragansett
and
the
economic
expert
put
on
the
stand
by
falstaff
that
this
was
an
intensely
competitive
market.
and
the
statement
by
competitors
given
the
concentration
and
the
increasing
trend
towards
the
concentration
is
precisely
the
kind
of
testimony
given
by
bankers
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
which
the
court
said
was
lay
evidence
not
entitled
to
particular
weight
on
this
issue.
so
far
as
the
economist
is
concern,
he
conceded
his
primary
argument
was
that
prices
had
not
risen
in
this
market
commensurate
with
cost.
he
conceded
that
he
had
not
examined
the
price
and
cost
data
for
the
new
england
market.
now
under
those
circumstances
the
whole
thrust
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
past
has
been
to
look
to
concentration
as
the
indicator
of
competition
in
the
marketplace.
i
think
that
brings
me
to
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kauper
i
think
that
is
a
subjective
question.
i
believe
we
showed
however
that
perception
by
objective
fact.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kauper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
from
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
rhode
island
dismissing
the
government's
complaint
with
the
antitrust
laws
against
the
falstaff
brewing
company.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
1965
acquisition
by
falstaff
brewing
corporation,
the
nation's
fourth
largest
brewer
of
the
assets
of
the
narragansett
brewing
company,
the
largest
brewer
in
new
england
violates
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended.
like
greeley,
the
preceding
case
on
the
docket,
it
is
a
potential
competition
case.
central
to
the
case
is
the
need
to
halt
and
if
possible
to
reverse
the
increasing
trend
towards
concentration
in
the
brewing
industry
in
local
markets,
a
trend
which
was
both
noted
with
concern
and
was
the
primary
basis
for
this
court's
1966
holding
in
united
states
against
pabst
brewing
company.
the
market
in
this
case
is
not
in
dispute,
it
is
stipulated,
it
is
the
production
and
sale
of
beer
in
the
new
england
area
comprised
of
the
six
new
england
states.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
case
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
there
was
any
direct
competition
between
falstaff
and
narragansett.
the
government
alleged
rather
that
falstaff
was
a
significant
potential
competitor
in
this
market
that
the
market
was
concentrated
and
becoming
increasingly
so
and
that
the
net
effect
of
its
elimination
as
a
potential
competitor
therefore
substantially
lessened
competition
within
the
meaning
of
section
7.
more
particularly,
the
government
alleged
that
falstaff
had
the
incentive
to
enter
--
it
had
the
financial
capability
to
enter.
it
had
reasonable
prospects
for
a
successful
de
novo
or
toe-hold
entry.
the
district
court
relying
on
two
findings
dismissed
the
government's
complaint.
more
specifically,
the
court
concluded
that
falstaff's
management
had
considered
the
acquisition
by
other
means,
find
them
unprofitable,
and
that
therefore,
the
decision
was
made
by
falstaff
not
to
enter
this
market
by
any
means
other
than
the
acquisition
of
narragansett.
mr.
kauper
no.
mr.
kauper
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
government's
theory
is
it
was
one
of
the
most
likely
entrants.
mr.
kauper
more
specifically,
if
i'm
right,
the
allegation
and
the
evidence
submitted
would
tend
to
indicate
that
it
is
one
of
the
nation's
10
largest
brewers.
seven
of
those
brewers
are
already
in
the
new
england
market.
mr.
kauper
two
of
them
--
well,
i
don't
know
who
had
said
they
were
way
out
west
but
they
were
significantly
further
west
than
falstaff
and
they
are
also
significantly
smaller
than
falstaff.
mr.
kauper
i
believe
that
was
the
case.
i
don't
think
we
would
have
to
establish
that
it
was
absolutely
the
only
one
that
could
do
so.
mr.
kauper
yes,
i
think
if
--
if
the
evidence
were
to
demonstrate
that
there
were
very
large
number
of
potential
entrants,
then
clearly
one
would
have
to
take
the
position
elimination
of
one
had
no
particular
impact.
mr.
kauper
i
think
that
essentially
is
correct,
yes.
so
that
its
elimination
had
some
consequence,
otherwise
clearly
it
would
not.
the
court
below,
we
believe
misconceived
standards
which
are
to
be
applied
in
this
sort
of
a
case,
more
particularly
in
its
two
key
holdings,
we
believe
that
it
improperly
relied
upon
subjective
statements
made
after
the
fact
as
to
what
the
intentions
of
falstaff's
management
would
have
been
at
a
previous
point
in
time.
second,
we
believe
that
it
failed
to
recognize
the
concentrated
nature
of
the
market
in
the
new
england
area.
in
finding
that,
this
particular
market
was
“intensely
competitive”.
finally,
we
believe
it
put
undue
weight
upon
certain
post-acquisition
evidence
which
tended
to
indicate
that
following
the
acquisition
by
falstaff,
narragansett's
market
share
declined.
let
me
now
briefly
deal
with
the
facts.
the
new
england
beer
market,
first
of
all,
is
a
growing
market
sales
--
total
sales
increased
by
9.5%
during
the
period
from
1960
to
1964.
in
1960,
the
top
eight
firms
in
the
market
controlled
74%
of
the
sales,
by
1964,
that
figure
was
81%.
in
1960,
the
top
four
firms
controlled
50%
of
the
market,
the
top
four
firms
in
1965,
61.3%
of
the
market.
in
the
seven
years
preceding
the
acquisition,
the
number
of
brewers
operating
plants
in
new
england
declined
from
11
to
6.
in
short,
we
believe
that
this
evidence
carefully
tracks
the
same
trends
which
were
noted
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
pabst
brewing
company
in
1966.
the
increasing
trend
towards
concentration,
the
decline
in
number
of
brewers
is
approximately
the
same.
we
also,
as
i
indicated,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
facts
are
indicated
that
there
are
10
--
of
the
10
largest
brewers
in
the
nation,
seven
are
already
marketing
in
the
new
england
area.
the
remaining
three
--
of
the
remaining
three,
falstaff
is
clearly
the
largest,
it
is
also
the
one
most
geographically
proximate
to
the
new
england
market
although
i
think
we
would
all
recognize
that
it's
not
within,
let's
suppose,
a
hundred
mile.
the
market
is
characterized
as
is
the
marketing
at
most
beer
by
heavy
promotional
and
advertising
expenditure.
the
narragansett
brewing
company
acquired
by
falstaff
at
the
time
of
acquisition
was
the
leading
brewer
in
terms
of
sales
in
the
new
england
area
with
approximately
20%
of
the
market.
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
a
healthy
firm,
its
profits
and
sales
had
increased
substantially
during
the
four
years
prior
to
the
acquisition.
it
had
engaged
in
significant
planned
expansion
and
indeed
inquired
--
acquired
certain
assets
from
certain
other
brewers
during
that
same
period.
its
distribution
system
was
primarily
through
independent
wholesale
distributors.
they
were
not
bound
by
contract
to
narragansett,
to
handle
narragansett's
beer
exclusively
and
indeed
the
evidence
suggest
than
in
most
instances
they
did
not.
the
falstaff
brewing
company,
the
acquiring
corporation,
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
was
the
fourth
largest
brewer
in
the
united
states
having
5.9%
of
the
market.
it
at
that
time
operated
eight
breweries.
most
of
those
breweries
had
been
acquired
by
falstaff
during
a
20-year
period.
in
most
instance,
there
were
small
failing
breweries
of
capacities
of
some
hundred,
two
hundred
thousand
barrels.
in
each
instance,
falstaff
had
substantially
modernized
those
plants,
had
greatly
expanded
their
capacity,
and
in
that
manner,
had
developed
the
system
which
made
them,
by
1965,
the
fourth
largest
brewer
in
the
nation.
during
the
period
preceding
--
immediately
preceding
the
acquisition,
falstaff's
sales
and
profits
had
also
expanded
greatly.
it
was
a
financially
healthy
company.
it
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
capital.
falstaff
distributed
its
beer
in
two
ways.
approximately
80%
of
its
beer
in
various
markets
was
distributed
through
independent
wholesale
distributors.
most
of
those
distributors
were
non-exclusive
distributors.
i
think
the
figure
is
something
like
75%
of
the
total
wholesale
distributors
did
not
carry
falstaff's
line
exclusively.
the
balance
of
its
beer
was
distributed
through
its
own
owned
branch
operations.
now
that
was
true
in
cities
where
it
operated
breweries.
it
was
also
true
in
the
number
of
cities
in
california.
so
that
it
was
experienced
with
at
least
two
types
of
distribution
system
namely
the
independent
wholesale
distributor
as
well
as
the
branch
distributor
which
it
owned.
so
far
as
entry
is
concerned,
falstaff
had
conceived
or
perceived
by
--
that
national
breweries
and
you
had
mr.
metzger
in
the
previous
case
referred
to
probably
the
four
best
known
international
brewers,
by
virtue
of
their
national
status
had
certain
competitive
advantages
over
falstaff.
this
includes
the
ability
to
advertise
on
a
national
basis
and
what
is
referred
to
as
the
so-called
prestige
factor.
in
fact,
an
individual
who
goes
in
to
buy
a
can
or
a
bottle
of
beer,
he
gets
accustomed
to
a
particular
brand
which
he
can
find
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
in
1958,
falstaff
commissioned
a
report
to
be
made
ahead
on
its
future
growth.
that
report
is
referred
to
throughout
the
record
as
the
arthur
d.
little
report
which
was
submitted
to
falstaff
in
1960.
that
report
was
designed
to
indicate
the
method
of
growth
for
the
falstaff
brewing
company
in
the
years
to
come.
it
made
a
number
of
recommendations
but
i'd
--
let
me
refer
to
three.
first,
it
rather
clearly
and
categorically
stated
that
if
falstaff
was
to
expand
its
sales,
it
would
need
to
become
a
national
brewer,
but
national
brewer
status.
second,
it
recommended
that
entry
be
made
into
new
markets
by
the
building
of
new
brewers.
specifically,
in
the
context
of
our
case,
it
suggested
that
--
excuse
me
--
falstaff
should
enter
into
the
new
england
market
--
pardon,
the
northeastern
market
by
the
building
of
a
new
brewery,
which
was
to
be
located
in
baltimore,
maryland.
but
more
generally,
it
concluded
that
building
of
a
new
brewery
was
more
economical
than
entry
by
other
means.
it
also
indicated
that
distribution
by
falstaff
through
its
own
company-owned
outlets
was
more
profitable
to
falstaff
than
entry
--
pardon
me,
distribution
through
the
use
of
independent
distributors.
following
a
receipt
of
that
report,
falstaff
began
through
public
pronouncement
and
otherwise
to
indicate
its
desire
to
become
a
national
brewery.
foremost
among
its
desires
was
an
entry
into
the
northeastern
market.
in
pursuing
that
particular
goal,
it
had
negotiations
with
several
other
brewers
before
culmination
of
the
acquisition
of
narragansett.
these
brewers
--
i
think
it
--
must
be
indicated
that
at
least
in
several
instances
came
to
narragansett
and
not
came
to
falstaff
and
not
the
other
way
around,
but
there
were
extended
negotiations
with
the
liebmann
brewing
company.
there
were
extended
negotiations
with
rheingold
brewers.
these
are
both
brewers
operating
primarily
or
have
brewing
headquarters
in
new
york
--
in
the
new
york
city
area
but
marketing
in
the
new
england
area.
employees
were
sent
to
visit
the
plants
of
the
piel
brewery,
plants
both
in
new
york
and
massachusetts.
there
were
contacts
made
with
other
brewers
in
the
upstate
new
york
area
and
indeed
contacts
inquiries
made
of
falstaff
by
several
smaller
brewers,
at
least
two,
pardon
me,
in
the
new
england
areas.
now
it's
in
that
setting
that
the
government
contends
that
the
acquisition
of
narragansett
by
falstaff
eliminated
a
significant
potential
competitor
from
this
market.
falstaff
does
not,
as
we
understand
it,
deny
that
it
had
the
capability,
financial,
technical
capability
to
enter
the
new
england
market,
nor
does
it
deny
at
least
in
general
--
in
general
that
it
had
a
strong
incentive
to
enter
the
northeastern
market.
it
does
not
assert
as
out
far
as
we
can
tell
that
there
were
any
other
brewers
who
are
more
likely
to
enter
into
the
new
england
market.
its
essential
argument
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
it
could
not
enter
this
market
other
than
by
its
acquisition
of
the
narragansett
brewing
company
because
and
this
was
the
basis
defining
by
the
district
court,
statements
made
by
its
executives
that
it
was
necessary
to
secure
a
strong,
viable
distribution
system
to
enter
the
northeastern
market
and
that
kind
of
system
could
be
obtained
only
through
the
acquisition
of
narragansett.
hence,
i
think
the
issue
in
a
large
part
comes
down
to
the
criteria
by
which
one
identifies
a
potential
competitor
in
a
given
market.
that
is
in
a
sense
issue
one.
second
of
all,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
falstaff
also
contends
that
this
market
was
in
fact
intensely
competitive.
now
i
take
it
that
the
relevance
of
that
is
that
if
the
market
was
intensely
competitive
before
the
acquisition,
intensely
competitive
after
the
acquisition,
the
elimination
of
the
significant
potential
competitor
in
and
of
itself
would
not
materially
hold
the
competition
in
the
marketplace,
and
hence
under
those
circumstances,
we
should
not
be
concerned
about
the
question
whether
falstaff
is
such
a
significant
potential
competitor.
now
in
general,
i
don't
think
after
the
discussion
yesterday
we
need
to
review
in
detail
the
theory
of
a
potential
competition
case.
in
essence,
it
has
two
parts,
one
is
that
the
particular
firm,
the
acquiring
firm
in
this
instance
was
in
fact
likely
to
enter
the
market
and
that
this
because
of
the
concentrated
nature
of
the
market
would
be
pro-competitive.
that
is
it
is
in
fact
a
likely
entrant.
second
part
of
the
theory
says
in
essence
that
its
presence
as
a
potential
competitor
is
likely
to
have
had
an
impact
on
the
behavior
of
firms
already
in
the
market.
and
it
is
that
impact
which
is
then
eliminated
through
its
entry
of
a
brewer,
particularly
of
the
size
of
this
particular
firm,
narragansett.
indeed,
in
the
cases
decided
by
this
court,
dealing
with
potential
competition,
there
appears
to
be
--
appears
to
have
been
more
emphasis
on
the
latter
than
on
the
former.
those
cases,
the
el
paso
case,
the
penn-olin
case,
procter
&
gamble,
ford
motor
case
decided
last
term,
all
emphasize
the
effect
which
that
particular
acquiring
firm
had
on
the
market
even
without
actual
entry,
but
instead
by
virtue
of
its
existence,
and
the
phrase
which
has
come
to
be
used
is
on
the
wings
of
the
market.
as
it
was
put
in
the
panel,
the
existence
of
an
aggressive,
well-equipped,
and
well-financed
corporation
engaged
in
the
same
or
related
lines
of
commerce
waiting
anxiously
to
enter
an
oligopolistic
market
would
be
a
substantial
incentive
to
competition.
now
that's
the
basic
theory.
mr.
kauper
yes.
mr.
kauper
well
obviously,
there
is
a
factual
question,
but
it
was
one
thing
in
any
case
of
this
sort,
but
i
think
the
question
is
what
is
it
that
the
facts
have
to
show?
our
contention
in
this
case
is
what
the
facts
have
to
show
is
that
there
was
a
substantial
incentive
to
enter,
that
there
was
capability
to
enter,
that
there
were
reasonable
prospects
for
entry
and
that
to
a
reasonable
improving
management,
there
was
such
an
opportunity
to
enter.
mr.
kauper
well
i
think
the
court
dealt
to
some
extent
that
same
question
yesterday.
they
questioned
what
is
subjective,
what
is
objective.
i
think
in
the
sense
of
are
they
anxious,
that
may
not
be
best
term
to
use.
it
is
of
course,
i
recognized
that
the
term
used
by
the
court.
but
what
it
suggests
is
a
firm
which
is
positioned
at
a
certain
point
in
the
market.
and
because
of
that
position,
that
firm
when
eliminated,
brings
about
an
anticompetitive
effect.
now
i
think
so
far
as
what
is
subjective,
what
is
objective
and
that
is
indeed
the
major
part
of
what
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case.
let
me
if
i
might
turn
to
that
because
there
were
some
discussions
of
that
yesterday.
i
think
the
question
which
was
put
yesterday
is
this
simply
a
matter
of
trying
--
retrying
the
facts
of
this
case
cannot
be
put
in
quite
those
terms
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
trying
to
decide
what
it
is
the
facts
have
to
show.
it
is
not
a
question
of
do
the
facts
show
that
this
firm
would
or
would
not
in
fact
have
entered.
instead,
the
government's
contention
is
that
the
court
should
apply
here
criteria
which
are
objective
and
structural
in
nature.
and
having
applied
those
criteria,
we
believe
the
government
has
met
its
burden
on
this
case.
mr.
kauper
our
--
in
our
judgment,
the
ultimately
--
ultimate
factual
inquiry,
let
me
put
it
in
several
parts
because
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
several
issues
although
in
a
sense
we're
really
only
talking
about
one.
obviously
number
one,
is
this
a
--
is
it
a
concentrated
mark.
and
i
--
that's
not
the
point
we
are
talking
about
now.
number
two,
is
a
question
of
how
many
entrants
might
there
be.
is
this
a
peculiar
entrant
or
one
of
a
group
peculiarly
like
(inaudible)
but
so
far
as
the
question
of
entry
itself
is
our
belief
and
we
believe
the
court
has
already
so
indicated
that
the
standard
to
be
applied
is
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
management
on
the
facts
established
would
have
believed
there
was
a
basis
for
entry
if
this
acquisition
had
been
prohibited.
now
--
mr.
kauper
i
think
we
would
be
prepared
to
make
that
argument.
now
in
this
case,
mr.
justice,
i
think
we
would
also
contend
that
the
particular
fact
on
which
that
finding
was
based
really
was
not
--
i'm
taking
that
particular
finding,
was
not
based
on
evidence
which
show
what
that
management
had
in
fact
done
in
the
year
1964
and
1965.
in
other
words,
i
think
there
is
a
second
part
to
the
problem
in
this
case
because
the
testimony
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
president
of
falstaff
in
particular,
his
testimony
given
in
a
much
later
date
as
to
what
he
would
have
done
or
would
not
have
done,
what
other
in
the
management
of
falstaff
would
or
would
not
have
done.
but
the
testimony
being
given
on
the
later
date
has
some
of
the
aspects
obviously
of
the
self-serving
state.
mr.
kauper
no,
i
don't
think
i
would
say
it
should
have
disbelieved.
i
think
the
argument
we
are
making
is
that
because
of
the
nature
of
that
evidence,
it
should
not
be
the
governing
criterion
at
all.
now,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
an
issue
of
credibility
of
that
statement
in
a
case
by
case
sort
of
basis.
but
the
standard
should
be
drawn
so
that
that
statement
is
really
not
the
crucial
issue.
i
don't
know
whether
i
have
made
that
point
but
it
seems
to
me,
when
you
say
is
it
a
matter
of
should
it
be
believed
or
should
not
be
believed,
i
think
that
the
ideal
standard
would
be
a
situation
in
which
you
did
not
put
a
man
on
the
stand
and
say
to
him,
“what
would
you
have
done
three
or
four
years
ago?”
mr.
kauper
yes.
i
think
that's
not
quite
the
point
i
am
dealing
with
here.
i
think
there
are
two
points.
one
is,
i
would
not
approach
this
as
a
standard
which
is
based
upon
testimony
given
in
a
later
fact.
now,
your
question
which
goes
to
anxiously
waiting
could
also
go
to
the
use
of
subjective
evidence
which
is
contemporaneous
with
the
evidence
but
it
just
seems
to
me
there
are
two
parts
to
this
particular
problem.
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
relied
upon
statements
of
the
management
that
they
would
not
have
entered
in
any
other
manner
other
than
the
acquisition
of
narragansett.
that
is
testimony
taken
at
a
later
point
in
time.
mr.
kauper
that's
correct.
mr.
kauper
well,
i
take
it
--
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
while.
i
take
it,
what
you
are
suggesting
is
perhaps
what
we
should
do
in
this
case
is
put
the
actual
members
of
the
industry
on
the
--
on
the
stand.
mr.
kauper
well,
i
–
mr.
kauper
yes.
mr.
kauper
yes.
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
question
of
impact
whether
we
call
it
on
the
wings
or
on
the
edge
or
whatever
words
they
use,
almost
already
in
the
market
is
a
matter
and
i
think
this
is
your
point
of
the
perceptions
of
those
within
the
industry.
that
is
one
reason
why
we
think
a
statement
made
after
the
fact
as
to
what
a
firm's
intention
would
have
been
is
not
the
criteria
to
be
applied
in
such
a
case.
obviously,
that
is
not
perceived
by
those
who
are
already
members
of
the
industry.
i
think
our
position
on
your
question
would
be
if
the
facts
in
the
record
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
basis
for
entry
which
would
have
been
acceptable
to
reasonable
man,
that
that
justifies
the
belief
that
others
would
have
perceived
the
same
thing.
mr.
kauper
well,
i
think
mr.
justice,
there
may
be
a
case
where
it
is
precisely
the
question
of
actual
entry.
that
is,
there
could
conceivably
be
again
where
a
firm
has
no
impact
on
the
wings,
so
to
speak,
but
where
in
fact
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
it
would
have
entered.
mr.
kauper
yes,
i
believe
there
could
be.
mr.
kauper
yes.
i'm
nearing
it
--
mr.
kauper
i
believe
that's
right.
i'm
nearing
the
end
of
time
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
i
reserve
the
balance
--
mr.
kauper
let
me
address
myself
to
several
matters
raised
in
the
argument
of
counsel.
he
suggested
there
was
no
evidence
of
apprehension
within
the
new
england
market
on
the
part
of
those
in
the
market
of
the
likelihood
of
entry
by
falstaff.
i
think
it
should
be
indicated,
number
one,
that
the
testimony
of
mr.
haffenreffer
which
he
read
to
you
of
course
says
he
did
not
fear
them
because
of
their
transportation
cost.
we
are
not
talking
about
their
entry
through
transportation.
but
i
think
more
important,
there
is
an
impressive
list
of
concerns
marketing
in
new
england
who
contacted
this
particular
brewing
company
with
respect
to
likelihood
of
acquisition,
not
only
the
majors
which
are
referred
to
be
--
primarily
in
the
brief,
but
several
smaller
brewers
contacted
the
falstaff
brewing
company
as
a
firm
whom
they
believe
would
be
likely
to
enter.
the
letters
from
distributors
which
are
contained
in
the
record,
some
20
of
them
already
existing
beer
distributors
simply
elude
to
the
rumors
in
the
likelihood
that
falstaff
was
preparing
to
enter
this
market.
and
now
it's
true
there
is
no
testimony
by
competitors
that
their
conduct
was
influenced
by
this
individual
firm
on
the
edge
in
the
market.
it
is
quite
clear
however
they
were
perceived
by
those
in
the
industry
as
a
rather
likely
entry.
mr.
kauper
are
you
talking
about
chief
executive
officer?
mr.
kauper
well,
i
think
that
--
that
what
mr.
haffenreffer
said
as
i
understand
it
is
that
during
the
time
that
he
was
operating
the
narragansett
brewery
he
did
not
fear
and
as
--
maybe
i
read
the
statement
incorrect,
“shipment
into
the
area
by
falstaff.
he
puts
it
specifically
in
terms
of
transportation.”
now
it
maybe
that
at
that
point
there
was
no
particular
likelihood
of
that
sort
of
conduct.
but
i
think
given
the
objective
facts
here
with
respect
to
the
likelihood
of
entry
and
the
perception
of
falstaff's
entry
by
those
in
the
industry
and
given
the
concentrated
nature
of
this
market
that
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
their
behavior
was
affected
by
this
particular
firm.
now,
i
think
and
let
me
turn
to
that
issue
because
we
really
did
not
discuss
it
earlier.
the
second
critical
finding
i
think
made
by
the
judge
and
there
are
some
difficulties
here
because
the
judge
made
no
detail
of
findings
of
fact
is
that
the
market
was
intensely
competitive.
now,
if
that
is
so,
presumably
the
elimination
of
the
significant
potential
competitor
is
a
very
little
customer.
nowhere
in
his
opinion
does
he
refer
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
concentrated
market.
nowhere
does
he
refer
to
the
fact
that
that
trend
was
increasing.
he
accepts
primarily
the
testimony
by
falstaff's
president,
the
chief
executive
officer
of
narragansett
and
the
economic
expert
put
on
the
stand
by
falstaff
that
this
was
an
intensely
competitive
market.
and
the
statement
by
competitors
given
the
concentration
and
the
increasing
trend
towards
the
concentration
is
precisely
the
kind
of
testimony
given
by
bankers
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
which
the
court
said
was
lay
evidence
not
entitled
to
particular
weight
on
this
issue.
so
far
as
the
economist
is
concern,
he
conceded
his
primary
argument
was
that
prices
had
not
risen
in
this
market
commensurate
with
cost.
he
conceded
that
he
had
not
examined
the
price
and
cost
data
for
the
new
england
market.
now
under
those
circumstances
the
whole
thrust
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
past
has
been
to
look
to
concentration
as
the
indicator
of
competition
in
the
marketplace.
i
think
that
brings
me
to
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kauper
i
think
that
is
a
subjective
question.
i
believe
we
showed
however
that
perception
by
objective
fact.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
