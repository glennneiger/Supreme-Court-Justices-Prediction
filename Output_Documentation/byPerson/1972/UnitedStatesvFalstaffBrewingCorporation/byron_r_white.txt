my
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
the
--
since
your
premise
is
that
--
that
this
case
is
likely
the
impact
of
falstaff
is
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
market,
that
--
that
is
an
assumption
about
the
--
its
effect
on
the
contenders
in
the
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
shouldn't
the
standard
be
what
--
how
contenders
in
the
market
would
view
a
potential
entrant
in
the
likelihood
of
potential
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
how
you
--
but
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
is
that
this
has
an
impact
on
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
if
no
fool
was
competing
in
the
market
would
assume
that
or
would
even
think
that
some
company
would
enter,
your
case
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
evidence
that
apprehension
was
taken
into
account
by
the
district
judge
in
applying
the
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
deciding
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
it
is
--
in
the
legal
standard
that
he
applied?
can
you
tell
what
legal
standards
he
applied?
i
guess
you
can,
he
just
stated
his
conclusion.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
think
the
government's
argument
is
however
if
he
shows
some
facts
about
an
industry
in
a
market
area
and
perhaps
to
be
a
very
effective
place
to
do
business,
it's
profitable
that
almost
anyone
in
the
industry
would
think
that
--
that
a
--
an
outsider
with
financial
resources
would
be
interested
in
entering
in
order
to
share
the
prosperity.
i
take
that's
the
government's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
facts
like
that,
there
must
be
facts
about
the
condition
of
the
market
in
this
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
