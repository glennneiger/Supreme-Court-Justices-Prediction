the
quotation
you
just
read
spoke
in
terms
of
waiting
anxiously
and
you
earlier
used
the
term
“likelihood”,
don't
those
both
suggest
that
the
inquiry
here
is
basically
factual
one?
you
wouldn't
disagree
with
that.
justice

well
assuming
that
those
facts
are
at
least
--
as
i
would
say
wouldn't
necessarily
add
up
to
the
concepts
--
concept
of
anxiously
waiting
to
enter.
there
is
a
subjective
element
connoted
by
the
phrase
“anxiously
waiting”
as
by
the
term
“likelihood”
i
think.
justice

what
is
the
ultimate
factual
inquiry
as
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
trial
court
finds
as
a
fact
that
this
particular
management
however
a
reasonable
manager
might
have
operated
did
not
plan
to
enter.
justice
william

do
you
say
then
the
district
court
should
have
disbelieved
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
will
remove
the
concept
of
anxiously
waiting
or
subjective
attempt,
make
it
kind
of
a
reasonable
man
of
negligence.
justice

mr.
kauper,
let
--
let
me
ask
you
on
more
question
if
i
may
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
white
about
the
competitor's
perception
of
this
potential
competitor.
i
take
it
ultimately
that
too
is
a
subjective
determination
isn't
albeit
on
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
people
in
the
market
already,
they
must
have
perceived
that
being
--
rather
than
just
it
being
a
question
of
a
reasonable
person
in
their
position
being
capable
of
perceiving.
