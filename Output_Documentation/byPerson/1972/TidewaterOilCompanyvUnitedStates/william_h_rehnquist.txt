justice

mr.
lasky,
supposing
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
held
otherwise
as
to
its
jurisdiction
and
entertained
your
appeal
and
ruled
with
you,
would
the
result
had
been
in
that
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
dismissal
and
then
doesn't
the
government
have
a
right
to
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
to
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could.
at
any
rate
the
proprietary
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
been
reviewed
under
the
expediting
act
by
this
court
at
some
future
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lasky,
if
you
are
right
in
your
last
contention
that
1292
(b)
did
repeal
something,
it
did
not
repeal
1292
(a)’s
limitation
on
right
to
appeal
injunctive
decrees
to
the
court
that
had
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
was
the
evarts
act
and
not
the
expediting
act
that
precluded
interlocutory
appeals,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
randolph
i
have
read
the
footnote
of
brown
shoe
and
i
do
not
get
any
impression
from
the
footnote
that
the
court
was
even
aware
that
1292
(b)
had
been
passed
several
years
early,
do
you
think
i
am
wrong?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
certainly
no
indication
in
the
footnote
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
they
were
not
aware
of
a
statute
passed
in
1958,
certainly
that
footnote
isn't
addressed
in
to
detain
the
construe
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
any
of
those
separate
opinions
mention
1292
(b)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
congress
changes
purposes
in
the
new
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
expediting
act
does
not
by
its
terms
deal
with
interlocutory
appeal,
does
it?

mr.
randolph,
is
there
no
a
statute
of
limitations
at
all
in
the
government
civil
antitrust
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
injunctive
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

none
under
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
randolph,
supposing
that
we
were
to
hold
that
1292
(b)
did
apply
to
this
sort
of
situation.
don't
you
think
that
since
the
certification
by
the
district
judge
is
discretionary
and
the
entertainment
of
the
appeal
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
also
discretionary
that
those,
the
lower
federal
courts
could
be
trusted
to
be
pretty
sparing
with
this
type
of

of
allowing
us
type
of
appeal?
