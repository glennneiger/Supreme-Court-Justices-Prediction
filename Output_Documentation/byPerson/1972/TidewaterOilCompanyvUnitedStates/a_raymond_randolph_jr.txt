mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lasky
is
quite
right
in
characterizing
the
issue
here
is
one
of
the
statutory
interpretation
somewhat
complicated
because
here
we
have
two
statutes
to
interpret,
the
expediting
act
in
1903
and
the
interlocutory
appeals
and
then
the
1958,
which
is
section
1292
(b).
since
we
believe
that
the
expediting
act
controls
the
decision
in
this
case
and
that
decision
below
should
therefore
be
affirmed,
i
will
begin
with
that
statute.
section
2
of
the
expediting
act
provides
and
i
quote
“that
in
government
civil
antitrust
cases,
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
will
lie
only
to
the
supreme
court.”
sac
passed
in
1903
had
two
basic
purposes.
one
to
eliminate
the
delay
of
intermediate
appeals
and
two
to
ensure
that
this
court
and
only
this
court
would
decide
that
the
questions
in
the
cases
presented
there
in
these
cases
because
of
their
importance
in
order
to
and
order
to
ensure
nationwide
uniformity
in
the
interpretation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
accomplish
--
congress
accomplished
both
of
these
objectives
in
the
act
as
it
obvious
from
its
terms
include
direct
path
from
the
district
court
to
this
court
in
final
judgments,
for
review
of
final
judgments.
but
it
also
precluded
interlocutory
appeals
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
it
did
this
because
of
the
time
that
was
passed
the
evarts
act
as
mr.
lasky
pointed
out
said
that
the
courts
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
to
review
interlocutory
appeals
only
in
cases
where
they
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
final
judgment.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
question
can
be
cleared
up
when
i
discuss
the
cases
that
have
interpreted
the
expediting
act.
if
congress
wanted
to
do
--
if
congress
had
the
purpose
of
precluding
intermediate
appeals
in
the
expediting
act
and
we
think
it
did.
it
would
have
been
just
simply
superfluous
word
to
say
and
also
we
do
not
want
any
interlocutory
appeals
to
take
place.
it
didn't
have
to
say
that
because
under
the
provisions
of
the
evarts
act
there
would
be
no
interlocutory
appeals
once
the
expediting
act
was
passed
and
that
is
why
congress
when
they
gave
this
court
the
jurisdiction
over
final
judgments
precluded
interlocutory
appeals.
now,
over
the
years
there
has
been
a
consistent
interpretation
of
the
expediting
act
to
mean
exactly
what
congress
intended
to
mean.
in
1929
mr.
justice
brandeis
stated
for
the
court
that
the
expediting
act
had
amended
the
provisions
of
the
evarts
act
and
he
said,
in
the
expediting
act,
mr.
lasky
pointed
this
also,
congress
“limited
the
right
of
review
to
an
appeal
from
a
decree
which
disposed
of
all
matters
and
precluded
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
either
to
this
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
an
interlocutory
decree.”
and
mr.
lasky
tells
us
that
was
difficult.
mr.
justice
brandeis
who
was
noted
for
his
sensitivity
to
jurisdiction,
in
pronouncing
that
statement,
was
not
the
holding
of
the
court
and
he
tells
us
this
because
he
says
that
in
that
case
what
we
really
had
was
a
final
judgment,
but
i
think
if
this
court
examines
the
opinion
in
california
canneries,
they
will
notice
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
never
did
resolve
whether
the
order
being
appealed
from
in
that
case
was
a
final
judgment
or
a
final
decree
or
an
interlocutory
decree,
what
decree.
what
he
said
was
it
doesn't
matter
which
it
is
because
the
courts
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
over
neither.
15
years
later,
after
the
opinion
in
the
california
canneries
case,
this
court
decided
a
case
entitled
allen
calculators
which
we
have
cited,
i
believe
on
the
page
23
of
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
court
also
relying
on
california
canneries
and
again
--
again
stated,
“jurisdiction
to
review
district
court
decrees
was
not
vested
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
but
solely
in
this
court
and
the
expediting
act,
the
expediting
act
limited
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
final
decrees,”
not
the
evarts
act,
the
expediting
act.
then
surely
they
are
after
in
two
other
cases
in
alkali
exporters
and
in
de
beers
case
both
of
which
involved
the
review
of
interlocutory
orders
and
government
civil
antitrust
cases
by
the
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
under
the
all
writs
act,
the
court
said
that
sole
appellate
jurisdiction
in
these
kinds
of
cases
lies
in
this
court.
it
said
the
expediting
act
“permits
appellate
review
of
interlocutory
orders
only
on
appeal
from
final
judgment”
and
it
pointed
out
that
the
act
“manifests
the
plain
indication
of
the
legislative
purpose
to
avoid
piecemeal
reviews.”
this
brings
us
to
brown
shoe
decided
in
1962,
four
years
after
the
amendment
to
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
that
tidewater
relies
upon.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
for
the
majority
cited
canneries
and
said
that
in
the
expediting
act,
congress
precluded
appeals
to
this
court
and
to
the
courts
of
appeals
from
interlocutory
decrees.
mr.
lasky
points
out
that
1292
(b)
was
not
involved
in
brown
shoe.
that
is
true,
but
what
was
involved
in
brown
shoe
was
the
question
whether
the
decree
in
that
case
was
a
final
judgment
and
one
of
the
factors
that
motivated
the
court
to
hold
that
it
was
a
final
judgment,
was
simply
that
if
it
was
not,
it
was
not
appealable
at
all.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
court
was
aware
of
it
of
it
or
not
but
-
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
court
in
making
that
statement
as
the
court
has
said
since
1929
in
all
of
the
cases
i
have
just
discussed.
it
said
that
the
statute
that
governs
appeals
in
government
civil
antitrust
cases
since
1903
is
the
expediting
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
oh!
i
am
not
arguing
that
that
should
be
considered
to
hold,
not
at
all.
but
i
think
it
is
also
a
significant
that
in
his
concurring
opinion
mr.
justice
clark,
coincidentally
was
no
friend
of
the
expediting
act,
stated
and
i
quote
again,
“that
the
act
declares
in
appeals
and
civil
antitrust
cases
in
which
the
united
states
is
complainant
and
lie
only
to
this
court.
it
does
deprives
the
parties
of
an
intermediate
appeal
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
separate
opinion
said
and
i
quote
again
that
“congress
has
seem
fit
to
make
this
court
the
sole
appellate
tribunal
for
civil
antitrust
cases
instituted
by
the
united
states
in
doing
so
as
chosen
to
limit
this
court's
review
and
power
to
final
judgments.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
not
(b)
but
mr.
justice
harlan
did
mention
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
and
he
said
that
if
this
were
other
than
a
government
civil
antitrust
case,
it
could
have
been
--
the
decree
could
have
been
appealed
to
the
courts
of
appeals
under
1292
(a),
that’s
on
page
365-370
us
365.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
did
in
the
sense
that
i
am
now
about
to
propose
to
the
court.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
1292
(b)
certainly
[attempt
to
laughter]
certainly
was
not
involved
in
any
of
these
cases,
we
agree
with
that.
but
the
important
point
is
that
we
find
from
every
justice
that
has
ever
spoken
about
the
matter,
saying
that
the
purpose
of
congress
in
passing
the
expedite,
expediting
act
was
to
preclude
interlocutory
appeals
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
that
congress
did
just
that.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
i
am
gong
to
discuss.
since
that
is
what
we
have,
a
consistent
interpretation
of
the
expediting
act
for
since
1929
to
1962
at
least
and
i
might
add
that
in
opinions
we
cited
in
our
brief
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
chambers,
he
repeated
the
same
thing.
that
it
is
against
this
background,
this
is
the
background
against
which
tidewater
argues
that
it
may
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
decree
in
this
case
and
relies
upon
1292
(b)
which
says
that
when
a
district
judge
in
making
in
a
civil
action
in
order
not
otherwise
appealable
under
this
section
certifies
that
it
involves
a
controlling
question
of
law
about
which
there
is
substantial
difference
of
opinion
that
and
it
may
as
resolution
on
appeal
may
advance
termination
litigation
then
the
court
of
appeals
has
discretion
whether
to
hear
the
appeal.
tidewater's
position
amounts
to
this
that
although
the
courts
of
appeals
have
no
jurisdiction
to
review
final
judgments
in
this
case
they
may
nevertheless
cite
controlling
questions
of
law
in
governments
civil
antitrust
cases
by
reviewing
interlocutory
orders.
in
others
words,
they
may
speak
about
and
decide
controlling
questions
of
the
law
in
cases
where
they
have
no
authority
to
speak
with
finality.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
is
it
tidewater's
position?
in
their
reply
brief
they
come
very
close
to
taking
that
position.
they
say
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that’s
right.
the
justice
department,
i
might
add
had
argued
otherwise
for
a
number
of
years
had
attempted
to
argue
otherwise
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
i
think
so.
but
i
think
as
far
as
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
involved
in
here
what
it
means
is
that
given
that
consistent
interpretation
of
the
expediting
act
of
1903
and
i
have
said
what
it
stands
for
and
what
this
court
has
said
it
stands
for,
the
question
is
whether
anything
changed
in
1958
by
the
passage
of
this
general
provision
that
applies
to
appeals
in
general
and
if
congress
were
about
to
change
the
expediting
act
and
has
been
trying
to
do
that
now
and
might
add
with
bill
before
it
since
1963
at
least,
one
would
expect
at
least
a
reference
to
the
expediting
act
in
the
provision
that
supposedly
repeals
part
of
it.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
this
court
said
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
not
on
its
face
but
i
think
you
have
to
forget
about
50
years
of
history
and
the
legislative
history
behind
it
to
say
that
expediting
act
as
its
purpose
did
not
preclude
interlocutory
appeals,
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
was
passed.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
says
only
final
judgments
on
the
face.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
that
is
right.
what
it
does
not
say
is
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
so
that
is
what
this
court
had
said
for
since
1929.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
me
whether
one
can
see
that
on
his
face,
it
does
not
say
interlocutory
appeal
and
that
was
my
--
what
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right
and
that
was
not
in
inadvertence
or
that
was
one
of
the
very
reasons
it
was
passed.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
of
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
or
the
expediting
act
mr.
justice?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
with
i
think
so
and
i
am
about
to
discuss,
discuss
that
question.
it
would
seem
that
reasonable
to
expect
and
since
what
we
are
talking
about
is
revision
of
the
policy
of
procedural
policy
that
has
been
followed
for
50
years
that
if
congress
were
about
to
revise
that,
they
would
at
least
mention
the
expediting
act.
they
will
discuss
it
thoroughly
or
say
this
is
the
way
the
expediting
act
should
be
revised.
but
one
will
search
in
vain
in
the
three
years
of
committee
reports,
this
bill
1292
(b)
passed
in
1958
came
about
as
the
result
of
a
draft
by
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states.
in
three
years
of
reports
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
there
is
not
one
word
about
the
expediting
act
or
any
indication
they
intended
to
revise
that.
there
is
not
one
word
about
government
civil
antitrust
cases.
one
can
look
through
the
congressional
hearings
on
this
bill,
the
house
report,
the
senate
report,
the
remarks
on
the
floor
in
congress,
again,
not
one
word
about
the
expediting
act.
not
one
word
about
government
civil
antitrust
cases
and
yet
tidewater
tells
us
that
the
very
purpose
of
this
bill
was
to
repeal
the
expediting
act
insofar
as
it
precluded
interlocutory
appeals.
now
there
is
mentioned,
there
is
some
mention
of
antitrust
cases.
we
have
to
remember
that
all
the
expediting
act
deals
with
is
government
civil
antitrust
cases
and
we
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
when
congress
was
talking
about
antitrust
cases
in
the
legislative
history
of
1292
(b)
they
were
referring
only
to
private
treble-damage
actions.
that
is
on
page
11
of
our
brief.
that
is
wrong?
i
apologize,
it
is
page
29
of
our
brief.
that
is
on
page
11,
tidewater’s
brief,
this
is
quoted.
but
the
senate
reports
says
that
disposition
of
antitrust
cases
may
take
considerable
time,
yet
upon
appeal
found
final
disposition
of
such
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
know
and
may
will
determine
the
statute
of
limitation
had
run
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
what
is
obvious
is
what
they
are
talking
about
there
is
private
treble-damage
action
because
the
final
disposition
of
that
kind
of
antitrust
case
would
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
whereas
in
the
government
case
it
will
come
to
this
court
and
no
one
has
disputed
that.
there
was
another
reason
why
that
--
which
is
not
mentioned
in
our
brief
which
occurred
to
me,
why
that
cannot
apply
--
why
that
quotation
cannot
apply
to
government
civil
antitrust
cases
and
simply
this,
that
when
the
united
states
brings
an
action
for
an
injunction
under
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act
that
there’s
no
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
that
the
examples
in
the
senate
report
and
in
the
house
report
that
deal
with
antitrust
cases
were
taken
from
chief
judge
parker's
testimony
in
the
hearings
on
1292
(b)
and
as
the
court
refers
to
that
they
will
notice
that
chief
judge
parker
testifying
about
it,
did
say
that
he
was
only
talking
about
private
anti
--
private
treble-damages
actions.
he
said,
take
for
example
on
action
of
private
treble-damages
action.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
for
injunctive
relief?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
there
is
one
in
the
private
treble-damages
action,
it
is
four
years
after
the
cause
of
action
accrues.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
the
reason
is
the
same
as
the
reason
for
allowing
any
interlocutory
appeal
which
is
simply
that
it
says
the
litigants
in
trial
courts
is
great
deal.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
i
can
think
of
a
reason.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
let
me
just
say
this.
now,
since
1963
congress
has
been
considering
bills
to
revise
the
expediting
act
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
they
came
very
close
in
the
last
congress
to
giving
a
thorough
revision
to
the
expediting
act.
and
what
they
were
about
to
do
there
was
make
it
the
basic
rule
that
all
these
appeals
will
go
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
justice
department
supported
this
legislation,
but
then
there
would
be
an
exception
that
after
the
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
if
the
attorney
general
of
the
district
court
certified
that
the
case
was
of
general
public
importance
then
there
would
be
a
direct
appeal
of
this
court,
but
this
court
would
have
discretion
to
refuse
the
appeal
and
remand
the
case
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
one
provision
that
is
being
contained
in
every
bill
before
congress
since
1963
and
these
were
cited
in
our
brief,
is
dealing
with
interlocutory
appeals
and
it
says
this
that
appeals
shall
be
allowed
under
1292
(a),
but
not
otherwise
and
that's
the
bill
that
passed
both
houses
of
congress
last
year
and
the
reason
for
it
is
in
the
committee
reports,
i
haven't
cited
this
in
our
brief,
but
in
the
committee
reports
on
the
bill
that
was
in
the
last
house
of
congress
that
congress
thought
it
would
be
anomalous
to
have
the
courts
of
appeals
deciding
controlling
questions
of
the
law
in
a
case
where
the
direct
appeal
might
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
in
the
committee
report?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
they
are.
if
i
can
read
the
directly
for
a
minute
to
make
our
point,
so
i
can
show
you
there
that
is
the
reason
that
is
expressed
there,
i
can
give
you
the
citation
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
i
think
also
the
question
that
remains
in
this
case
that
constantly
remains
in
this
case
is
why
would
--
if
congress
wanted
to
revise
the
expediting
act,
why
would
they
have
done
it
this
way?
and
we
had
--
we're
given
an
expedite
–
well,
first
of
all
they
did
not
even
mention
the
expediting
act
in
any
of
the
history
and
what
we
have
is
a
clear
policy
of
the
expediting
act,
includes
interlocutory
appeals
and
i
think
that
unless
congress
even
deals
with
that
question
that
a
general
statute
can't
repeal
that
expediting
act
provision.
but
the
rationalization
that
tidewater
gives
is
well
what
congress
wanted
to
do
is
save
this
court
a
lot
of
time
and
wanted
to
reduce
this
court's
workload
because
of
the
direct
appeals
under
the
expediting
act.
well,
the
strange
thing
is
that
that's
not
mentioned
at
all
in
any
of
the
commission
--
committee
reports,
the
hearings
and
anything
else.
but
the
interesting
about
it
is,
i
fail
to
see
how
appeals
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
provision
is
going
to
reduce
this
court's
workload
one
iota
because
the
point
is
that
no
matter
what
the
court
of
appeals
decides
when
the
interlocutory
appeal,
the
number
of
cases
where
a
direct
appeal
would
lie
remains
the
same.
in
fact
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
would
depend,
it
would
depend.
well,
first
of
all
there
could
be
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals,
that
judgment.
that
would
be
one
avenue
and
the
court
would
get
the
case
after
considering
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
if
it
goes
back,
this
is
a
question
that
has
never
been
decided
by
the
court,
but
it's
possible,
when
you
have
multiple
parties
in
the
case
under
rule
54
(d)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
a
district
judge
may
enter
an
order
as
to
one
party
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--
a
final
judgment
order
and
then
we
may
appeal
just
simply
that
part
of
the
case
under
the
expediting
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
as
the
final
judgment,
but
anyway
take
for
example,
a
case
that
derives
under
the
clayton
--
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
question
in
the
case
is
that
is
there
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
defender.
he
claims
section
7
doesn't
cover
conglomerate
mergers
and
the
district
court
denies
the
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
suppose
you
can
have
an
interlocutory
appeal.
well,
the
defendant
then
takes
as
you
know
certainly
a
controlling
question
of
law,
certainly
important.
maybe
it
is
substantial
difference
of
opinion
about
it,
the
defendant
takes
his
appeal
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
affirms
let's
suppose
and
says
the
section
7
may
in
fact
cover
conglomerate
mergers,
then
what
happens?
of
course
since
it's
such
an
important
question,
the
defendant
petitions
for
certiorari
and
then
what
does
this
court
do?
well,
it
looks
at
it,
it's
certainly
important,
i
mean,
if
that
is
the
test
for
granting
certiorari,
certainly
significant.
suppose
the
court
grants
certiorari
and
then
decides
that
issue,
somewhat
in
the
abstract
i
might
happen
and
then
what
happens?
well,
then
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court
and
suppose
the
court
says
section
7
does
cover
conglomerate
mergers,
the
case
goes
back,
you
have
a
full
trial
after
which
there
could
be
another
direct
appeal
because
the
claim
would
be
then
that
the
evidence
does
not
support
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
case
would
have
looked
--
the
court
would
have
at
the
case
twice.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
suppose
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
it
could
be
on
any
number
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
right.
but
suppose
that
the
--
suppose
there
were
interlocutory
appeals
allowed
and
how
many
times
would
the
court
have
to
look
at
the
case?
once,
one
time.
of
course
the
litigants,
you
know,
if
the
court
finally
decides
that
section
7
does
not
cover
conglomerate
mergers,
it
put
the
litigants
to
a
great
deal
of
effort,
they
put
the
trial
court
to
a
great
deal
of
effort
that
might
otherwise
have
been
avoided.
but
the
point
is
that
that
--
congress
made
that
judgment
with
respect
to
government
civil
antitrust
cases.
it
decided,
look
we
have
a
choice.
one
is
to
allow
interlocutory
appeals
and
save
the
litigants
and
time
in
district
courts,
the
other
is
to
get
expeditious
review
on
appeal.
congress
made
the
choice
in
1903.
it
hasn't
changed
it
yet,
it
very
well
may
in
the
future,
it's
been
considering
that.
but
that's
--
that
judgment
as
the
government
civil
antitrust
case
is
already
been
made.
we
do
not
think
it
has
been
revised.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
just
have
no
basis
on
which
to
make
that
judgment.
i
might
say
this
though
that
in
these
government
civil
antitrust
cases,
i
would
--
if
i
were
a
district
judge,
perhaps
my
inclination
would
be
that
if
there
were
any
way
to
get
it
off
my
back,
i'd
do
that
and
one
of
the
ways
may
very
well
be
to
keep
certifying
interlocutory
appeals.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
thankfully
not,
i
maybe
hypothetical
with
myself,
but
anyway
that
possibility
is
real.
i
think
that
is
something
that
congress
has
to
consider,
the
possibility
of
too
many
certifications
and
therefore
slowing
down
the
disposition
of
these
cases
where
time
is
important.
the
cases
do
drag
out
over
a
number
of
years,
but
i
think
time
is
important
in
these
cases.
particularly
when
you
have
injunctions
in
effect
or
injunction
is
not
which
is
a
usual
type
situation.
and
so
i
think
in
summary
what
it
comes
down
to
is
this,
that
the
system
of
the
appellate
review
for
expediting
act
cases
that
tidewater
envisages.
with
circuit
courts
of
appeals
that
have
no
jurisdiction
to
review
final
judgments
passing
on
controlling
questions
of
law
is
an
anomaly
in
the
federal
appellate
system.
there
is
no
other
area
of
federal
appellate
law
where
that
exists.
now,
tidewater
says,
that's
may
be
congress
experimented,
but
it
seems
strange
that
congress
did
not
even
mention
this,
mentioned
the
possibility
of
this
kind
of
system
arising.
if
it
was
attempting
an
experiment
it
did
not
even
know
what
ingredients
it
was
pouring
into
the
brew.
and
i
think
that
in
itself
casts
substantial
doubt
in
the
correctness
of
tidewater's
position.
and
we
add
to
this
the
fact
there
is
no
indication,
whatsoever
the
congress
considered
the
expediting
act
or
even
considered
in
the
revision
of
1292
(b),
the
burdens
on
this
court
and
that
it's
doubtful
at
best
that
tidewater's
proposed
scheme
would
even
save
this
court
any
trouble
and
that
in
a
long
series
of
cases
from
the
canneries
case
to
brown
shoe
every
justice
who
has
spoken
on
the
matter
said
that
the
expediting
act
forbids
interlocutory
appeals.
when
you
put
all
this
together,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
court
below
correctly
held
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
tidewater's
appeal
and
we
think
therefore
that
decision
would
be
affirmed
--
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lasky
is
quite
right
in
characterizing
the
issue
here
is
one
of
the
statutory
interpretation
somewhat
complicated
because
here
we
have
two
statutes
to
interpret,
the
expediting
act
in
1903
and
the
interlocutory
appeals
and
then
the
1958,
which
is
section
1292
(b).
since
we
believe
that
the
expediting
act
controls
the
decision
in
this
case
and
that
decision
below
should
therefore
be
affirmed,
i
will
begin
with
that
statute.
section
2
of
the
expediting
act
provides
and
i
quote
“that
in
government
civil
antitrust
cases,
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
will
lie
only
to
the
supreme
court.”
sac
passed
in
1903
had
two
basic
purposes.
one
to
eliminate
the
delay
of
intermediate
appeals
and
two
to
ensure
that
this
court
and
only
this
court
would
decide
that
the
questions
in
the
cases
presented
there
in
these
cases
because
of
their
importance
in
order
to
and
order
to
ensure
nationwide
uniformity
in
the
interpretation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
accomplish
--
congress
accomplished
both
of
these
objectives
in
the
act
as
it
obvious
from
its
terms
include
direct
path
from
the
district
court
to
this
court
in
final
judgments,
for
review
of
final
judgments.
but
it
also
precluded
interlocutory
appeals
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
it
did
this
because
of
the
time
that
was
passed
the
evarts
act
as
mr.
lasky
pointed
out
said
that
the
courts
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
to
review
interlocutory
appeals
only
in
cases
where
they
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
final
judgment.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
question
can
be
cleared
up
when
i
discuss
the
cases
that
have
interpreted
the
expediting
act.
if
congress
wanted
to
do
--
if
congress
had
the
purpose
of
precluding
intermediate
appeals
in
the
expediting
act
and
we
think
it
did.
it
would
have
been
just
simply
superfluous
word
to
say
and
also
we
do
not
want
any
interlocutory
appeals
to
take
place.
it
didn't
have
to
say
that
because
under
the
provisions
of
the
evarts
act
there
would
be
no
interlocutory
appeals
once
the
expediting
act
was
passed
and
that
is
why
congress
when
they
gave
this
court
the
jurisdiction
over
final
judgments
precluded
interlocutory
appeals.
now,
over
the
years
there
has
been
a
consistent
interpretation
of
the
expediting
act
to
mean
exactly
what
congress
intended
to
mean.
in
1929
mr.
justice
brandeis
stated
for
the
court
that
the
expediting
act
had
amended
the
provisions
of
the
evarts
act
and
he
said,
in
the
expediting
act,
mr.
lasky
pointed
this
also,
congress
“limited
the
right
of
review
to
an
appeal
from
a
decree
which
disposed
of
all
matters
and
precluded
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
either
to
this
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
an
interlocutory
decree.”
and
mr.
lasky
tells
us
that
was
difficult.
mr.
justice
brandeis
who
was
noted
for
his
sensitivity
to
jurisdiction,
in
pronouncing
that
statement,
was
not
the
holding
of
the
court
and
he
tells
us
this
because
he
says
that
in
that
case
what
we
really
had
was
a
final
judgment,
but
i
think
if
this
court
examines
the
opinion
in
california
canneries,
they
will
notice
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
never
did
resolve
whether
the
order
being
appealed
from
in
that
case
was
a
final
judgment
or
a
final
decree
or
an
interlocutory
decree,
what
decree.
what
he
said
was
it
doesn't
matter
which
it
is
because
the
courts
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
over
neither.
15
years
later,
after
the
opinion
in
the
california
canneries
case,
this
court
decided
a
case
entitled
allen
calculators
which
we
have
cited,
i
believe
on
the
page
23
of
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
court
also
relying
on
california
canneries
and
again
--
again
stated,
“jurisdiction
to
review
district
court
decrees
was
not
vested
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
but
solely
in
this
court
and
the
expediting
act,
the
expediting
act
limited
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
final
decrees,”
not
the
evarts
act,
the
expediting
act.
then
surely
they
are
after
in
two
other
cases
in
alkali
exporters
and
in
de
beers
case
both
of
which
involved
the
review
of
interlocutory
orders
and
government
civil
antitrust
cases
by
the
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
under
the
all
writs
act,
the
court
said
that
sole
appellate
jurisdiction
in
these
kinds
of
cases
lies
in
this
court.
it
said
the
expediting
act
“permits
appellate
review
of
interlocutory
orders
only
on
appeal
from
final
judgment”
and
it
pointed
out
that
the
act
“manifests
the
plain
indication
of
the
legislative
purpose
to
avoid
piecemeal
reviews.”
this
brings
us
to
brown
shoe
decided
in
1962,
four
years
after
the
amendment
to
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
that
tidewater
relies
upon.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
for
the
majority
cited
canneries
and
said
that
in
the
expediting
act,
congress
precluded
appeals
to
this
court
and
to
the
courts
of
appeals
from
interlocutory
decrees.
mr.
lasky
points
out
that
1292
(b)
was
not
involved
in
brown
shoe.
that
is
true,
but
what
was
involved
in
brown
shoe
was
the
question
whether
the
decree
in
that
case
was
a
final
judgment
and
one
of
the
factors
that
motivated
the
court
to
hold
that
it
was
a
final
judgment,
was
simply
that
if
it
was
not,
it
was
not
appealable
at
all.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
court
was
aware
of
it
of
it
or
not
but
-
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
court
in
making
that
statement
as
the
court
has
said
since
1929
in
all
of
the
cases
i
have
just
discussed.
it
said
that
the
statute
that
governs
appeals
in
government
civil
antitrust
cases
since
1903
is
the
expediting
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
oh!
i
am
not
arguing
that
that
should
be
considered
to
hold,
not
at
all.
but
i
think
it
is
also
a
significant
that
in
his
concurring
opinion
mr.
justice
clark,
coincidentally
was
no
friend
of
the
expediting
act,
stated
and
i
quote
again,
“that
the
act
declares
in
appeals
and
civil
antitrust
cases
in
which
the
united
states
is
complainant
and
lie
only
to
this
court.
it
does
deprives
the
parties
of
an
intermediate
appeal
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
separate
opinion
said
and
i
quote
again
that
“congress
has
seem
fit
to
make
this
court
the
sole
appellate
tribunal
for
civil
antitrust
cases
instituted
by
the
united
states
in
doing
so
as
chosen
to
limit
this
court's
review
and
power
to
final
judgments.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
not
(b)
but
mr.
justice
harlan
did
mention
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
and
he
said
that
if
this
were
other
than
a
government
civil
antitrust
case,
it
could
have
been
--
the
decree
could
have
been
appealed
to
the
courts
of
appeals
under
1292
(a),
that’s
on
page
365-370
us
365.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
did
in
the
sense
that
i
am
now
about
to
propose
to
the
court.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
1292
(b)
certainly
[attempt
to
laughter]
certainly
was
not
involved
in
any
of
these
cases,
we
agree
with
that.
but
the
important
point
is
that
we
find
from
every
justice
that
has
ever
spoken
about
the
matter,
saying
that
the
purpose
of
congress
in
passing
the
expedite,
expediting
act
was
to
preclude
interlocutory
appeals
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
that
congress
did
just
that.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
i
am
gong
to
discuss.
since
that
is
what
we
have,
a
consistent
interpretation
of
the
expediting
act
for
since
1929
to
1962
at
least
and
i
might
add
that
in
opinions
we
cited
in
our
brief
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
chambers,
he
repeated
the
same
thing.
that
it
is
against
this
background,
this
is
the
background
against
which
tidewater
argues
that
it
may
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
decree
in
this
case
and
relies
upon
1292
(b)
which
says
that
when
a
district
judge
in
making
in
a
civil
action
in
order
not
otherwise
appealable
under
this
section
certifies
that
it
involves
a
controlling
question
of
law
about
which
there
is
substantial
difference
of
opinion
that
and
it
may
as
resolution
on
appeal
may
advance
termination
litigation
then
the
court
of
appeals
has
discretion
whether
to
hear
the
appeal.
tidewater's
position
amounts
to
this
that
although
the
courts
of
appeals
have
no
jurisdiction
to
review
final
judgments
in
this
case
they
may
nevertheless
cite
controlling
questions
of
law
in
governments
civil
antitrust
cases
by
reviewing
interlocutory
orders.
in
others
words,
they
may
speak
about
and
decide
controlling
questions
of
the
law
in
cases
where
they
have
no
authority
to
speak
with
finality.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
is
it
tidewater's
position?
in
their
reply
brief
they
come
very
close
to
taking
that
position.
they
say
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that’s
right.
the
justice
department,
i
might
add
had
argued
otherwise
for
a
number
of
years
had
attempted
to
argue
otherwise
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
i
think
so.
but
i
think
as
far
as
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
involved
in
here
what
it
means
is
that
given
that
consistent
interpretation
of
the
expediting
act
of
1903
and
i
have
said
what
it
stands
for
and
what
this
court
has
said
it
stands
for,
the
question
is
whether
anything
changed
in
1958
by
the
passage
of
this
general
provision
that
applies
to
appeals
in
general
and
if
congress
were
about
to
change
the
expediting
act
and
has
been
trying
to
do
that
now
and
might
add
with
bill
before
it
since
1963
at
least,
one
would
expect
at
least
a
reference
to
the
expediting
act
in
the
provision
that
supposedly
repeals
part
of
it.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
this
court
said
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
not
on
its
face
but
i
think
you
have
to
forget
about
50
years
of
history
and
the
legislative
history
behind
it
to
say
that
expediting
act
as
its
purpose
did
not
preclude
interlocutory
appeals,
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
was
passed.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
says
only
final
judgments
on
the
face.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
that
is
right.
what
it
does
not
say
is
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
so
that
is
what
this
court
had
said
for
since
1929.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
me
whether
one
can
see
that
on
his
face,
it
does
not
say
interlocutory
appeal
and
that
was
my
--
what
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right
and
that
was
not
in
inadvertence
or
that
was
one
of
the
very
reasons
it
was
passed.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
of
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
or
the
expediting
act
mr.
justice?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
with
i
think
so
and
i
am
about
to
discuss,
discuss
that
question.
it
would
seem
that
reasonable
to
expect
and
since
what
we
are
talking
about
is
revision
of
the
policy
of
procedural
policy
that
has
been
followed
for
50
years
that
if
congress
were
about
to
revise
that,
they
would
at
least
mention
the
expediting
act.
they
will
discuss
it
thoroughly
or
say
this
is
the
way
the
expediting
act
should
be
revised.
but
one
will
search
in
vain
in
the
three
years
of
committee
reports,
this
bill
1292
(b)
passed
in
1958
came
about
as
the
result
of
a
draft
by
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states.
in
three
years
of
reports
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
there
is
not
one
word
about
the
expediting
act
or
any
indication
they
intended
to
revise
that.
there
is
not
one
word
about
government
civil
antitrust
cases.
one
can
look
through
the
congressional
hearings
on
this
bill,
the
house
report,
the
senate
report,
the
remarks
on
the
floor
in
congress,
again,
not
one
word
about
the
expediting
act.
not
one
word
about
government
civil
antitrust
cases
and
yet
tidewater
tells
us
that
the
very
purpose
of
this
bill
was
to
repeal
the
expediting
act
insofar
as
it
precluded
interlocutory
appeals.
now
there
is
mentioned,
there
is
some
mention
of
antitrust
cases.
we
have
to
remember
that
all
the
expediting
act
deals
with
is
government
civil
antitrust
cases
and
we
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
when
congress
was
talking
about
antitrust
cases
in
the
legislative
history
of
1292
(b)
they
were
referring
only
to
private
treble-damage
actions.
that
is
on
page
11
of
our
brief.
that
is
wrong?
i
apologize,
it
is
page
29
of
our
brief.
that
is
on
page
11,
tidewater’s
brief,
this
is
quoted.
but
the
senate
reports
says
that
disposition
of
antitrust
cases
may
take
considerable
time,
yet
upon
appeal
found
final
disposition
of
such
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
know
and
may
will
determine
the
statute
of
limitation
had
run
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
what
is
obvious
is
what
they
are
talking
about
there
is
private
treble-damage
action
because
the
final
disposition
of
that
kind
of
antitrust
case
would
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
whereas
in
the
government
case
it
will
come
to
this
court
and
no
one
has
disputed
that.
there
was
another
reason
why
that
--
which
is
not
mentioned
in
our
brief
which
occurred
to
me,
why
that
cannot
apply
--
why
that
quotation
cannot
apply
to
government
civil
antitrust
cases
and
simply
this,
that
when
the
united
states
brings
an
action
for
an
injunction
under
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act
that
there’s
no
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
that
the
examples
in
the
senate
report
and
in
the
house
report
that
deal
with
antitrust
cases
were
taken
from
chief
judge
parker's
testimony
in
the
hearings
on
1292
(b)
and
as
the
court
refers
to
that
they
will
notice
that
chief
judge
parker
testifying
about
it,
did
say
that
he
was
only
talking
about
private
anti
--
private
treble-damages
actions.
he
said,
take
for
example
on
action
of
private
treble-damages
action.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
for
injunctive
relief?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
there
is
one
in
the
private
treble-damages
action,
it
is
four
years
after
the
cause
of
action
accrues.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
the
reason
is
the
same
as
the
reason
for
allowing
any
interlocutory
appeal
which
is
simply
that
it
says
the
litigants
in
trial
courts
is
great
deal.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
i
can
think
of
a
reason.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
let
me
just
say
this.
now,
since
1963
congress
has
been
considering
bills
to
revise
the
expediting
act
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
they
came
very
close
in
the
last
congress
to
giving
a
thorough
revision
to
the
expediting
act.
and
what
they
were
about
to
do
there
was
make
it
the
basic
rule
that
all
these
appeals
will
go
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
justice
department
supported
this
legislation,
but
then
there
would
be
an
exception
that
after
the
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
if
the
attorney
general
of
the
district
court
certified
that
the
case
was
of
general
public
importance
then
there
would
be
a
direct
appeal
of
this
court,
but
this
court
would
have
discretion
to
refuse
the
appeal
and
remand
the
case
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
one
provision
that
is
being
contained
in
every
bill
before
congress
since
1963
and
these
were
cited
in
our
brief,
is
dealing
with
interlocutory
appeals
and
it
says
this
that
appeals
shall
be
allowed
under
1292
(a),
but
not
otherwise
and
that's
the
bill
that
passed
both
houses
of
congress
last
year
and
the
reason
for
it
is
in
the
committee
reports,
i
haven't
cited
this
in
our
brief,
but
in
the
committee
reports
on
the
bill
that
was
in
the
last
house
of
congress
that
congress
thought
it
would
be
anomalous
to
have
the
courts
of
appeals
deciding
controlling
questions
of
the
law
in
a
case
where
the
direct
appeal
might
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
in
the
committee
report?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
they
are.
if
i
can
read
the
directly
for
a
minute
to
make
our
point,
so
i
can
show
you
there
that
is
the
reason
that
is
expressed
there,
i
can
give
you
the
citation
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
i
think
also
the
question
that
remains
in
this
case
that
constantly
remains
in
this
case
is
why
would
--
if
congress
wanted
to
revise
the
expediting
act,
why
would
they
have
done
it
this
way?
and
we
had
--
we're
given
an
expedite
–
well,
first
of
all
they
did
not
even
mention
the
expediting
act
in
any
of
the
history
and
what
we
have
is
a
clear
policy
of
the
expediting
act,
includes
interlocutory
appeals
and
i
think
that
unless
congress
even
deals
with
that
question
that
a
general
statute
can't
repeal
that
expediting
act
provision.
but
the
rationalization
that
tidewater
gives
is
well
what
congress
wanted
to
do
is
save
this
court
a
lot
of
time
and
wanted
to
reduce
this
court's
workload
because
of
the
direct
appeals
under
the
expediting
act.
well,
the
strange
thing
is
that
that's
not
mentioned
at
all
in
any
of
the
commission
--
committee
reports,
the
hearings
and
anything
else.
but
the
interesting
about
it
is,
i
fail
to
see
how
appeals
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
provision
is
going
to
reduce
this
court's
workload
one
iota
because
the
point
is
that
no
matter
what
the
court
of
appeals
decides
when
the
interlocutory
appeal,
the
number
of
cases
where
a
direct
appeal
would
lie
remains
the
same.
in
fact
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
would
depend,
it
would
depend.
well,
first
of
all
there
could
be
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals,
that
judgment.
that
would
be
one
avenue
and
the
court
would
get
the
case
after
considering
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
if
it
goes
back,
this
is
a
question
that
has
never
been
decided
by
the
court,
but
it's
possible,
when
you
have
multiple
parties
in
the
case
under
rule
54
(d)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
a
district
judge
may
enter
an
order
as
to
one
party
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--
a
final
judgment
order
and
then
we
may
appeal
just
simply
that
part
of
the
case
under
the
expediting
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
as
the
final
judgment,
but
anyway
take
for
example,
a
case
that
derives
under
the
clayton
--
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
question
in
the
case
is
that
is
there
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
defender.
he
claims
section
7
doesn't
cover
conglomerate
mergers
and
the
district
court
denies
the
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
suppose
you
can
have
an
interlocutory
appeal.
well,
the
defendant
then
takes
as
you
know
certainly
a
controlling
question
of
law,
certainly
important.
maybe
it
is
substantial
difference
of
opinion
about
it,
the
defendant
takes
his
appeal
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
affirms
let's
suppose
and
says
the
section
7
may
in
fact
cover
conglomerate
mergers,
then
what
happens?
of
course
since
it's
such
an
important
question,
the
defendant
petitions
for
certiorari
and
then
what
does
this
court
do?
well,
it
looks
at
it,
it's
certainly
important,
i
mean,
if
that
is
the
test
for
granting
certiorari,
certainly
significant.
suppose
the
court
grants
certiorari
and
then
decides
that
issue,
somewhat
in
the
abstract
i
might
happen
and
then
what
happens?
well,
then
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court
and
suppose
the
court
says
section
7
does
cover
conglomerate
mergers,
the
case
goes
back,
you
have
a
full
trial
after
which
there
could
be
another
direct
appeal
because
the
claim
would
be
then
that
the
evidence
does
not
support
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
case
would
have
looked
--
the
court
would
have
at
the
case
twice.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
suppose
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
it
could
be
on
any
number
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
right.
but
suppose
that
the
--
suppose
there
were
interlocutory
appeals
allowed
and
how
many
times
would
the
court
have
to
look
at
the
case?
once,
one
time.
of
course
the
litigants,
you
know,
if
the
court
finally
decides
that
section
7
does
not
cover
conglomerate
mergers,
it
put
the
litigants
to
a
great
deal
of
effort,
they
put
the
trial
court
to
a
great
deal
of
effort
that
might
otherwise
have
been
avoided.
but
the
point
is
that
that
--
congress
made
that
judgment
with
respect
to
government
civil
antitrust
cases.
it
decided,
look
we
have
a
choice.
one
is
to
allow
interlocutory
appeals
and
save
the
litigants
and
time
in
district
courts,
the
other
is
to
get
expeditious
review
on
appeal.
congress
made
the
choice
in
1903.
it
hasn't
changed
it
yet,
it
very
well
may
in
the
future,
it's
been
considering
that.
but
that's
--
that
judgment
as
the
government
civil
antitrust
case
is
already
been
made.
we
do
not
think
it
has
been
revised.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
just
have
no
basis
on
which
to
make
that
judgment.
i
might
say
this
though
that
in
these
government
civil
antitrust
cases,
i
would
--
if
i
were
a
district
judge,
perhaps
my
inclination
would
be
that
if
there
were
any
way
to
get
it
off
my
back,
i'd
do
that
and
one
of
the
ways
may
very
well
be
to
keep
certifying
interlocutory
appeals.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
thankfully
not,
i
maybe
hypothetical
with
myself,
but
anyway
that
possibility
is
real.
i
think
that
is
something
that
congress
has
to
consider,
the
possibility
of
too
many
certifications
and
therefore
slowing
down
the
disposition
of
these
cases
where
time
is
important.
the
cases
do
drag
out
over
a
number
of
years,
but
i
think
time
is
important
in
these
cases.
particularly
when
you
have
injunctions
in
effect
or
injunction
is
not
which
is
a
usual
type
situation.
and
so
i
think
in
summary
what
it
comes
down
to
is
this,
that
the
system
of
the
appellate
review
for
expediting
act
cases
that
tidewater
envisages.
with
circuit
courts
of
appeals
that
have
no
jurisdiction
to
review
final
judgments
passing
on
controlling
questions
of
law
is
an
anomaly
in
the
federal
appellate
system.
there
is
no
other
area
of
federal
appellate
law
where
that
exists.
now,
tidewater
says,
that's
may
be
congress
experimented,
but
it
seems
strange
that
congress
did
not
even
mention
this,
mentioned
the
possibility
of
this
kind
of
system
arising.
if
it
was
attempting
an
experiment
it
did
not
even
know
what
ingredients
it
was
pouring
into
the
brew.
and
i
think
that
in
itself
casts
substantial
doubt
in
the
correctness
of
tidewater's
position.
and
we
add
to
this
the
fact
there
is
no
indication,
whatsoever
the
congress
considered
the
expediting
act
or
even
considered
in
the
revision
of
1292
(b),
the
burdens
on
this
court
and
that
it's
doubtful
at
best
that
tidewater's
proposed
scheme
would
even
save
this
court
any
trouble
and
that
in
a
long
series
of
cases
from
the
canneries
case
to
brown
shoe
every
justice
who
has
spoken
on
the
matter
said
that
the
expediting
act
forbids
interlocutory
appeals.
when
you
put
all
this
together,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
court
below
correctly
held
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
tidewater's
appeal
and
we
think
therefore
that
decision
would
be
affirmed
--
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
