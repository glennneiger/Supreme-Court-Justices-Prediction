(inaudible)
justice

well,
is
it
their
position
they
can
review
and
give
injunction
orders
to
interlocutory
exempted
orders?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
from
91
--
992
(a)
is
clear
that
courts
of
appeals
may
not
review
interlocutory
exempted
orders?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
say
final
judgments?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
does
deal
with
interlocutory
appeals
since
the
interlocutory
appeals
may
not
be
solved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
possibly
it
means
that
no
interlocutory
appeals
should
be
taken
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
interlocutory
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
suggest
as
the
reason
for
1292
(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
reasons
for
1292
(b)
would
apply
equally
do
the
kind
of
the
suit
we
have
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
would
be
no
reason
if
you
could
think
of
to
exclude
this
kind
of
case
from
1292
(b)
if
you
were
approaching
it
rationally
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
your
interlocutory
of
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
an
interlocutory
appeal
somewhere,
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
--
are
those
reasons
expressed
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
there
is
some
reason,
some
sensible
reason
for
saying
that
the
policy
of
1292
should
not
reach
cases
like
this?
justice
byron

white
do
you
agree
that
if

of
appeals
had
allowed
this
interlocutory
appeal
and
it
decided
for
tidewater
that
--
that
would
that
--
the
matter
would
have
gone
back
to
the
district
court
and
that
issue
would
have
been
appealable
here
by
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
if
that
--
that
means
that
if
you
don't
have
an
appeal
as
a
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
final
