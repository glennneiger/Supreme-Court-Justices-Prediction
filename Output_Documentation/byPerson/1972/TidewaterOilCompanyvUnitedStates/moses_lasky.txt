mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
can
be
stated
quite
quickly
and
quite
succinctly.
it
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
it
can
be
stated
this
way,
“does
the
court
of
appeals
have
jurisdiction
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958
to
entertain
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
a
government
civil
antitrust
case
or
has
that
appeal
been
precluded
by
the
much
earlier
expediting
act
of
1903.”
now
the
act
of
1958
was
of
course
a
revolutionary
act
because
it
was
the
customary
and
traditional
animosity
of
the
law
to
interlocutory
appeals
that
had
been
existed
from
time
immemorial,
first
broken
through
in
the
evarts
act
of
1891
to
have
interlocutory
appeals
on
the
injunctive
orders.
in
1958,
as
a
result
of
the
experience
of
judges,
and
administrative
office
of
the
courts,
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
was
enacted
because
it
was
believed
there
were
situations
where
an
interlocutory
appeal
could
be
very
helpful
in
speeding
along
the
law
in
situation
of
both
the
district
judge
certified
the
cases
in
appropriate
one
and
the
court
of
appeals
felt
the
same.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh!
yes
and
our
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
pass
upon
that.
it
simply
said
it
had
no
jurisdiction
even
to
consider
the
matter.
mr.
moses
lasky
they
didn't
consider
the
matter
on
its
merits.
now
this
case
the
present
case
would,
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction,
have
been
the
perfect
textbook
example
of
an
appropriate
case
for
an
interlocutory
appeal.
now
the
question
on
which
the
interlocutory
appeal
was
certified
by
the
district
court
was
a
sharp,
simple
and
controlling
question
of
law.
this
suit
had
been
filed
in
1966
to
enjoin
acquisition
by
phillips
petroleum
company
of
certain
of
the
assets
in
the
west
of
tidewater
oil
company
charging
that
it
would
violate
clayton
act,
section
7.
after
extensive
hearings,
taking
of
evidence,
the
district
court
had
denied
a
restraining
order,
denied
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
parties
although
the
closing
date
had
come,
did
not
consummate
the
case
could
deferred
--
doing
anything
at
all
until
the
district
court
had
denied
the
restraint
and
injunction
and
then
the
transaction
was
consummated,
the
sale
was
made.
the
case
then
proceeded
for
the
next
five
years
as
one
for
divestiture
against
phillips
petroleum.
and
the
seller,
my
client,
tidewater
remained
in
the
case
passively
except
to
respond
to
all
discovery,
and
then
when
discovered
was
completed
and
the
government
announced
it
was
ready
to
go
to
trial.
tidewater
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
as
against
it
on
the
simple
legal
proposition
that
section
7
is
not
aimed
at
the
seller,
but
is
directed
solely
at
the
buyer.
that
was
a
clean
cut
proposition.
if
we
were
correct
that
prevented
the
cases
to
tidewater
and
as
the
trial
judge
said
that
the
case
would
be
a
different
case.
the
district
judge,
this
time
a
different
district
judge
denied
the
motion.
our
motion
to
be
dismissed
but
being
doubtful
of
the
correctness
of
his
decision,
he
volunteered
to
certify
for
interlocutory
appeal
or
in
the
alternative
suggested
that
would
mandamus.
well
mandamus
was
of
course
not
an
open
remedy
because
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
what
the
laws
meant.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
misconstrue
the
law,
so
mandamus
was
not
over.
now,
we
did
hereupon
petitioned
the
ninth
circuit
within
the
time
allowed
by
the
act
for
an
interlocutory
appeal.
that
court
held
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
and
it
held
that
the
expediting
act
of
1903
precluded
it
from
having
jurisdiction.
it
did
saw
however
solely
upon
the
basis
of
authorities
having
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
of
appeals
to
entertain
an
appeal
from
orders
granting
or
denying
interlocutory
injunctions
and
that
has
a
wholly
different
history
as
i
will
suggest
and
indicate.
now
the
case
is
here
before
this
court
because
of
the
conflict.
the
ninth
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuits
both
in
the
same
quick
decision
cited
some
authorities
that
held
that
court
of
appeals
lacks
jurisdiction
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act.
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
very
careful
opinion
has
held
that
court
of
appeals
do
possess
jurisdiction.
and
thereupon,
this
court
having
denied
my
petition
for
certiorari,
granted
it
upon
a
petition
for
rehearing.
now
the
place
to
start
analysis
i
would
assume
must
be
the
text
of
two
statutes.
if
it
isn't
the
place
to
end
it
now,
this
is
certainly
the
place
to
start
analysis.
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958
states
in
the
plaintiffs
possible
language,
“that
in
a
civil
action,
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
a
court
of
appeals
may
be
taken,
if
the
district
court
makes
a
certain
certification
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
discretionary
permits.”
in
other
words,
in
a
civil
action
are
all
comprehensive,
they
are
unlimited
as
to
type
of
suit,
there
are
unlimited
as
to
litigant.
on
the
other
hand,
the
expediting
act
which
was
enacted
of
course
55
years
earlier
says
nothing
at
all
about
interlocutory
appeals.
there
is
not
a
word
in
it
about
the
subject.
it
simply
says,
“that
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment”
and
“in
the
government
civil
antitrust
suit
will
lie
only
to
this
court.”
now
as
the
seventh
circuit
very
closely
observed
if
these
two
acts
had
been
enacted
by
congress
simultaneously,
the
language
of
each
could
have
been
given
effect
without
limiting
the
scope
of
the
other.
and
it
is
of
course
the
fundamental
principle
that
of
statutory
construction
that
where
there
are
two
acts
effect
should
be
given
to
each,
if
possible.
now
as
the
seventh
circuit
commented,
there
is
entirely
different
language
with
respect
to
interlocutory
appeals
from
injunctive
orders,
that
goes
back
to
the
evarts
act
of
1891.
and
what
the
evarts
act
said
was
that
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
injunctive
orders
can
be
taken
to
a
court
of
appeals
if
that
court
has
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment,
that
was
in
the
act.
so
that
what
when
in
1903,
the
expediting
act
was
passed
which
said
that
appeals
from
final
judgments
as
its
language
in
government
civil
antitrust
cases
lay
to
this
court
alone,
that
class
of
cases
seize
to
be
the
class
of
cases
to
that
the
evarts
act
had
to
do
with
by
its
express
language.
now
over
the
years,
there
has
been
--
there
have
been
revisions
in
the
language
of
the
evarts
act,
revisions
of
amendments
and
codifications,
finally
getting
into
the
judicial
code
in
1948
and
as
a
result
there
has
been
debate
whether
the
court
of
appeals
can
entertain
an
appeal
from
interlocutory
injunctive
order
as
of
right
and
again
there
is
a
conflict.
the
ninth
circuit
and
one
of
the
other
circuits
holds
no
and
the
first
circuit
held
yes.
and
that
question
has
never
reached
this
court
because
it
was
never
to
anybody's
interest
to
bring
it
here.
now
i
am
not
debating
that
line
of
decisions
here,
it's
not
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
right
to
interlocutory
appeal
not
as
of
right
but
discretionary
under
the
act
of
1958.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh!
yes
and
that
if
the
court
please
is
why
i
do
not
ask
this
court
to
determine
whether
the
appeal
should
be
allowed.
i
merely
ask
this
court
to
tell
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
that
question
and
to
remand
this
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
to
determine
whether
we
should
have
an
appeal.
it's
well
established
i
think
that
if
lower
court
denies
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
therefore
refuses
to
exercise
it
this
court
can
tell
it
you
do
have
jurisdiction
now
exercise
it.
what
the
ninth
circuit
might
do
to
my
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
when
we
get
back
is
an
open
question,
but
it's
not
a
question
i
can
present
to
this
court.
now
the
government's
argument
here
has
been
that
the
expediting
act
is
a
special
act
and
that
1958
interlocutory
appeals
act
is
a
general
act
and
that
a
later
general
is
not
repeal
an
earlier
special
act
unless
it
is
very
specific,
but
the
error
in
that
argument
is
that
both
acts
are
special
acts
and
the
act
of
1958
repeals
nothing.
i
would
say
they
are
both
special
acts
in
this
sense.
the
expediting
act
of
1903
is
a
special
act
dealing
with
the
problem
of
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
in
a
specific
kind
of
case,
government
civil
antitrust.
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958
is
a
special
act
dealing
with
the
right
to
take
interlocutory
appeals
in
all
kinds
of
legislation.
no
repeal
of
the
expediting
act
is
involved
here
because
as
i
have
already
suggested
to
the
court
the
expediting
act
is
nothing
about
interlocutory
appeals.
now
the
reason,
the
reason
why
before
1958
there
was
no
right
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
a
government
antitrust
case
was
not
that
the
expediting
act
prohibited
it,
but
because
there
was
no
act
of
congress
which
authorized
it.
prior
to
1891
there
was
no
act
that
authorized
any
interlocutory
appeal.
then
we
had
an
act
that
authorized
interlocutory
appeals
on
injunctive
orders
to
a
court
that
had
a
jurisdiction
over
the
final
appeal,
but
not
until
1958
that
any
kind
of
law
or
statute
authorize
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
different
character.
so
the
act
of
1958
repeals
nothing,
it
added
something
brand
new
to
the
law,
something
which
the
courts
have
felt
would
be
useful
and
i
have
cited
in
the
brief,
a
statement
from
the
harvard
journal
on
legislation
that
the
judgment
of
the
congress
that
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
would
expedite
litigation
have
proved
to
be
sound
from
experience.
now
we
come
then
to
this
question,
that
government
has
relied
primarily
on
dictum,
language
of
justice
brandeis
in
united
states
versus
california
canneries,
the
famous
language
and
i
will
read
those
two
sentences
because
this
what
the
case
has
been
made
to
turn
on
by
the
court
below.
he
said
the
court
referring
to
the
provisions
concerning
appeal
prior
to
the
expediting
act,
these
provisions
governing
appeals
in
general
were
amended
by
the
expediting
act
so
that
the
suit
in
equity
under
the
antitrust
act
“in
which
the
united
is
complainant”
the
appeal
should
be
direct
to
this
court
from
the
final
decree
in
the
trial
court.
thus
congress
limited
the
right
of
review
to
an
appeal
from
the
decree
which
disposed
of
all
matters
and
have
precluded
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
to
either
court
from
an
interlocutory
decree.
that’s
the
language
my
adversary
seeks
to
fasten
on
us
as
somehow
disposing
of
this
case.
i
have
two
observations
i
wish
to
make
about
that
language
and
i
believe
both
them
are
very
(inaudible).
first
the
court
was
not
then
laying
down
any
rule
of
constitutional
law.
it
says
there
cannot
be
interlocutory
appeals
and
that
everything
must
be
decided
on
a
final
appeal.
it
was
laying
down
no
law
of
nature,
some
to
use
of
expression
of
mr.
justice
homes,
some
bruiting
omni
presence
in
the
sky.
it
was
saying
nothing
about
some
immutable
perpetual
restriction.
it
was
chief
speaking
about
(inaudible)
legislative
policy
on
the
state
of
the
statutes
in
1925
and
it
was
entirely
correct
in
what
it
said
because
since
congress
had
made
no
provision
for
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
it
provided
that
it
could
only
--
the
final
appeal
went
to
this
court
it
was
correct
there
was
no
way
to
get
an
interlocutory
appeal.
now
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
was
enacted
55
years
after
the
expediting
act,
about
30
years
after
the
california
canneries
case
was
a
sharp
break
with
former
attitudes
about
desirability
of
interlocutory
appeals.
as
i
have
already
suggested
it
was
a
new
departure
manifesting
erratically
different
attitude
toward
interlocutory
appeals
from
the
former
antipathy.
and
in
the
canneries
case
this
court
was
at
most
expressing
a
judgment
on
what
congress
had
done,
not
on
what
congress
could
do
or
what
might
be
doing
30
years
later.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
it
was.
mr.
moses
lasky
now
the
point
the
brown
shoe
was
that
it
was
pure
dictum.
the
question
was
not
--
that
was
not
the
question
in
brown
shoe.
the
question
in
brown
shoe
was
whether
a
decision
by
the
trial
court
in
an
acquisition
violated
the
law
before
it
had
created
a
remedy
was
sufficiently
final
to
permit
appeal
to
toll
and
the
court
held
it
was.
then
in
a
footnote,
it
had
this
statement.
now
as
to
that
of
course
it
is
well
settled
that
not
only
the
dictum
is
not
binding,
but
statements
made
in
a
context
in
which
the
matter
is
not
even
before
the
court
should
not
be
given
broad
and
exaggerated
value.
just
the
other
day
i
said
the
other
day,
in
may
of
this
year
in
kastigar
versus
the
united
states,
visited
here
which
is
reported
in
406
united
states
this
court
observed
that
broad
language,
particularly
in
dictum
and
in
the
context
of
ancillary
points,
not
essential
to
the
decision
of
the
court
has
no
weight.
now
not
only
was
brown
shoe
dictum
where
the
court
wasn't
dealing
with
the
question,
it
wasn't
presented
to
it
for
its
consideration
but
what
was
said
in
the
canneries
case
on
the
subject
was
also
a
dictum,
also
a
dictum
for
this
reason.
there
what
was
being
appealed
from
was
an
order
denying
a
motion
for
leave
to
intervene
after
a
final
decree,
the
united
states
versus
swift
&
company
and
it's
settled
law
that
a
post
judgment
order
on
appeal
from
a
post
judgment
order
is
not
an
interlocutory
appeal.
it
itself
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
order
which
this
court
has
held
in
el
paso
case,
one
of
the
el
paso
natural
gas
cases,
well,
settled
at
the
time
and
most
of
justice
brandeis’
opinion
was
pointing
that
out
if
that
was
a
final
order
therefore
the
appeal
lay
only
to
that
court.
mr.
moses
lasky
definitely.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
can
answer
that.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
expediting
act
was
enacted
under
certain
suppositions.
that
this
was
a
way
to
expedite
litigation
and
experience
has
shown
that
it
was
not.
secondly,
that
it
was
better
to
get
the
case
into
the
hands
of
this
court
and
bypass
the
courts
of
appeal
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
remarked
much
more
has
been
read
into
the
expediting
act
then
it
actually
contained.
now
we're
coming
now
to
questions
of
policy
and
as
to
this
i
think
my
adversaries
when
they
present
this
questions
of
policy
or
holding
the
sword
by
its
blade.
this
court
has
frequently
observed
that
it
appreciates,
i
can
make
good
use
of
the
screening
function
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
useful.
this
court
or
justices
of
this
court
have
more
than
once
in
the
last
few
years
observed
that
the
expediting
act
is
not
as
desirable
to
milly
(ph)
as
it
once
was.
now
we
have
an
act
here,
and
my
adversary
says
they
can
conceive
legislation
to
handle
the
problem
much
better
than
this
and
i
do
not
dispute,
the
congress
might
think
of
legislation
better
than
this,
but
i
say,
here
is
an
act
that
exists
and
what
aid
the
congress
has
given
to
this
court
should
not
be
spurned
even
if
there
maybe
foul.
now
let
me
address
myself
to
the
question
of
two
things
whether
this
is
an
anomalous
procedure
and
whether
it
would
impose
a
burden
on
this
court
instead
of
alleviating
a
burden
which
i
submit
is
the
case.
it
is
not
anomalous.
congress
has
a
right
to
experiment
on
appellate
procedure.
it
could
well
determine
that
interlocutory
appeals
are
helpful.
it
did
so
determined
experience
showed
it
was
right.
at
the
same
time
he
could
very
well
say
but
let
us
not
burden
supreme
court
with
interlocutory
appeals.
let
us
carry
them
through
the
court
of
appeals,
then
this
court
through
it
certiorari
jurisdiction
having
the
benefit
of
that
screening,
the
benefit
of
that
judgment
can
look
at
it
upon
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
determine
whether
it
deserves
further
review.
mr.
moses
lasky
it
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
to
this
court
at
the
end
of
the
whole
case
or
immediately
if
the
court
made
a
proper
order
i
think
it
is
under
rule
54,
i
don't
have
the
exact
rule
number,
but
could
have
specified
no
reason
for
delay
on
that
appeal,
that
is
true.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
in
other
this
court
remains
the
final
word
in
government
civil
antitrust
cases,
but
it
also
remains
the
final
word
in
every
other
case.
and
in
every
other
case
it
determines
that
question
whether
it
should
intervene
after
it
has
had
the
benefit
of
the
views
of
court
of
appeals.
the
procedure
that
i
say
submit
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
offers
is
that
it
can
do
the
same
here
and
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
extraordinarily
useful
if
the
courts
below
made
greater
use
of
this
kind
of
procedure.
now
there
are
other
arguments
that
have
been
presented
by
my
adversaries
and
i
approach
the
matter
from
a
standpoint
of
responding
to
adversaries
argument
because
it
seems
to
me
and
as
it
seemed
to
the
seventh
circuit
if
you
take
the
language
of
the
statute
on
his
face,
it
is
plainly
in
favor
of
the
interlocutory
appeal.
the
only
way
adversaries
read
the
language
to
eliminate
that
is
to
bring
the
bear
upon
an
erroneous
history
which
is
--
or
the
history
of
interlocutory
appeals
from
injunctive
orders.
now
one
other
argument
has
been
presented
by
solicitor
general's
office
which
is
that
interlocutory
appeals
from
injunctive
orders
deserve,
are
more
meritorious,
and
should
be
allowed
more
than
interlocutory
appeals
of
the
discretionary
type
that
the
1958
act
deals
with.
of
course
that
is
a
value
judgment,
they
start
with
that
premise.
and
they
say
that
no
interlocutory
appeal
lies
from
an
injunctive
order
in
a
government
antitrust
suit
and
it
would
be
very
anomalous
then
to
permit
it
to
lie
from
another
type
of
order.
this
is
one
of
the
major
arguments
made
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
it
has
several
flaws
about
it.
in
first
place,
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
an
injunction
does
--
an
appeal
does
not
lie
form
an
interlocutory
appeals
injunctive
order
in
a
government
antitrust
suit
under
28
u.s.c.
§
1292
(a).
now
1292
(a)
is
the
old
evarts
act
brought
up
to
date.
1292
(b)
is
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958.
there
was
a
difference.
where
you
have
an
appeal
under
1292
(a)
it
is
as
of
right
of
injunctive
orders,
receiverships.
to
have
an
appeal
under
1292
(b)
it
is
a
matter
of
joint
discretion
of
the
two
lower
courts.
now
it
is
not
at
all
settled
that
there
is
no
(inaudible)
as
of
right
from
an
injunctive
order
because
as
i
say
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
circuits
on
that
and
this
court
has
never
resolved
it.
but
assuming
that
you
cannot
have
an
appeal
from
an
injunctive
order
as
of
right
under
1292
(a)
then
you
do
have
that
right
under
1292
(b)
because
1292
(b)
says,
here
is
its
language,
“when
a
district
judge
in
making
in
a
civil
action
an
order
not
otherwise
appealable
under
this
section”
that’s
1292,
“then
the
1958
procedure
applies.”
so
that
the
argument
doesn’t
hold
up.
i
submit
the
matter
in
this
way.
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958
was
the
combination
of
a
growing
feeling
over
the
years
with
the
old,
hard
rule
against
interlocutory
appeals
was
injurious
to
the
administration
of
justice
and
it
opened
it
up.
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
repealed
nothing.
it
added
something
to
the
law.
on
a
face
of
the
statute
literally
it
allows
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
any
kind
of
civil
case
to
a
court
of
appeals
if
the
two
lower
courts
believe
it
isn't
a
appropriate
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
in
this
--
it
not
really
repealed
add
to
because
1292
(a)
is
a
right
to
appeal
as
a
right.
it
does
not
call
for
any
certification
by
the
district
court.
it
calls
for
no
permission
by
court
of
appeal.
then
had
an
order
to
--
in
order
to
come
in
under
1292
(b)
one
would
have
to
show
that
there
is
involved
a
controlling
question
of
law
upon
which
there
is
good
grounds
for
dispute.
i
think
and
that
the
decision
would
expedite
the
litigation.
those
were
the
tests
that
have
to
be
made
under
1292
(b)
that
do
not
have
to
be
made
under
1292
(a).
now
in
how
many
injunction,
preliminary
injunction
cases,
matters
that
would
--
you
could
meet
those
tests,
i
do
not
know.
i
think
you
might
often
be
able
to
do
so
because
an
interlocutory
injunction
as
was
observed,
i
think
by
mr.
justice
fortas
in
one
of
the
cases
in
this
court,
granted
in
a
section
7
case
often
has
the
effect
of
terminating
the
transaction
and
terminating
litigation.
so
that
i
submit
that
the
statute
on
its
face
allows
an
interlocutory
appeal.
i
submit
that
the
statute,
so
interpreted,
so
applied
would
go
along
way
to
alleviate
the
burden
of
this
court,
would
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
the
screening
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
do
not
dispute
that
congress
might
well
look
at
it
again
and
determine
what
other
relief
would
be
in
order,
but
that
is
no
reason
to
spurn
the
relief
which
congress
has
presently
given
to
us.
thank
you.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
if
the
court
please,
i
have
to
submit.
mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
can
be
stated
quite
quickly
and
quite
succinctly.
it
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
it
can
be
stated
this
way,
“does
the
court
of
appeals
have
jurisdiction
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958
to
entertain
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
a
government
civil
antitrust
case
or
has
that
appeal
been
precluded
by
the
much
earlier
expediting
act
of
1903.”
now
the
act
of
1958
was
of
course
a
revolutionary
act
because
it
was
the
customary
and
traditional
animosity
of
the
law
to
interlocutory
appeals
that
had
been
existed
from
time
immemorial,
first
broken
through
in
the
evarts
act
of
1891
to
have
interlocutory
appeals
on
the
injunctive
orders.
in
1958,
as
a
result
of
the
experience
of
judges,
and
administrative
office
of
the
courts,
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
was
enacted
because
it
was
believed
there
were
situations
where
an
interlocutory
appeal
could
be
very
helpful
in
speeding
along
the
law
in
situation
of
both
the
district
judge
certified
the
cases
in
appropriate
one
and
the
court
of
appeals
felt
the
same.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh!
yes
and
our
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
pass
upon
that.
it
simply
said
it
had
no
jurisdiction
even
to
consider
the
matter.
mr.
moses
lasky
they
didn't
consider
the
matter
on
its
merits.
now
this
case
the
present
case
would,
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction,
have
been
the
perfect
textbook
example
of
an
appropriate
case
for
an
interlocutory
appeal.
now
the
question
on
which
the
interlocutory
appeal
was
certified
by
the
district
court
was
a
sharp,
simple
and
controlling
question
of
law.
this
suit
had
been
filed
in
1966
to
enjoin
acquisition
by
phillips
petroleum
company
of
certain
of
the
assets
in
the
west
of
tidewater
oil
company
charging
that
it
would
violate
clayton
act,
section
7.
after
extensive
hearings,
taking
of
evidence,
the
district
court
had
denied
a
restraining
order,
denied
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
parties
although
the
closing
date
had
come,
did
not
consummate
the
case
could
deferred
--
doing
anything
at
all
until
the
district
court
had
denied
the
restraint
and
injunction
and
then
the
transaction
was
consummated,
the
sale
was
made.
the
case
then
proceeded
for
the
next
five
years
as
one
for
divestiture
against
phillips
petroleum.
and
the
seller,
my
client,
tidewater
remained
in
the
case
passively
except
to
respond
to
all
discovery,
and
then
when
discovered
was
completed
and
the
government
announced
it
was
ready
to
go
to
trial.
tidewater
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
as
against
it
on
the
simple
legal
proposition
that
section
7
is
not
aimed
at
the
seller,
but
is
directed
solely
at
the
buyer.
that
was
a
clean
cut
proposition.
if
we
were
correct
that
prevented
the
cases
to
tidewater
and
as
the
trial
judge
said
that
the
case
would
be
a
different
case.
the
district
judge,
this
time
a
different
district
judge
denied
the
motion.
our
motion
to
be
dismissed
but
being
doubtful
of
the
correctness
of
his
decision,
he
volunteered
to
certify
for
interlocutory
appeal
or
in
the
alternative
suggested
that
would
mandamus.
well
mandamus
was
of
course
not
an
open
remedy
because
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
what
the
laws
meant.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
misconstrue
the
law,
so
mandamus
was
not
over.
now,
we
did
hereupon
petitioned
the
ninth
circuit
within
the
time
allowed
by
the
act
for
an
interlocutory
appeal.
that
court
held
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
and
it
held
that
the
expediting
act
of
1903
precluded
it
from
having
jurisdiction.
it
did
saw
however
solely
upon
the
basis
of
authorities
having
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
of
appeals
to
entertain
an
appeal
from
orders
granting
or
denying
interlocutory
injunctions
and
that
has
a
wholly
different
history
as
i
will
suggest
and
indicate.
now
the
case
is
here
before
this
court
because
of
the
conflict.
the
ninth
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuits
both
in
the
same
quick
decision
cited
some
authorities
that
held
that
court
of
appeals
lacks
jurisdiction
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act.
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
very
careful
opinion
has
held
that
court
of
appeals
do
possess
jurisdiction.
and
thereupon,
this
court
having
denied
my
petition
for
certiorari,
granted
it
upon
a
petition
for
rehearing.
now
the
place
to
start
analysis
i
would
assume
must
be
the
text
of
two
statutes.
if
it
isn't
the
place
to
end
it
now,
this
is
certainly
the
place
to
start
analysis.
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958
states
in
the
plaintiffs
possible
language,
“that
in
a
civil
action,
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
a
court
of
appeals
may
be
taken,
if
the
district
court
makes
a
certain
certification
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
discretionary
permits.”
in
other
words,
in
a
civil
action
are
all
comprehensive,
they
are
unlimited
as
to
type
of
suit,
there
are
unlimited
as
to
litigant.
on
the
other
hand,
the
expediting
act
which
was
enacted
of
course
55
years
earlier
says
nothing
at
all
about
interlocutory
appeals.
there
is
not
a
word
in
it
about
the
subject.
it
simply
says,
“that
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment”
and
“in
the
government
civil
antitrust
suit
will
lie
only
to
this
court.”
now
as
the
seventh
circuit
very
closely
observed
if
these
two
acts
had
been
enacted
by
congress
simultaneously,
the
language
of
each
could
have
been
given
effect
without
limiting
the
scope
of
the
other.
and
it
is
of
course
the
fundamental
principle
that
of
statutory
construction
that
where
there
are
two
acts
effect
should
be
given
to
each,
if
possible.
now
as
the
seventh
circuit
commented,
there
is
entirely
different
language
with
respect
to
interlocutory
appeals
from
injunctive
orders,
that
goes
back
to
the
evarts
act
of
1891.
and
what
the
evarts
act
said
was
that
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
injunctive
orders
can
be
taken
to
a
court
of
appeals
if
that
court
has
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment,
that
was
in
the
act.
so
that
what
when
in
1903,
the
expediting
act
was
passed
which
said
that
appeals
from
final
judgments
as
its
language
in
government
civil
antitrust
cases
lay
to
this
court
alone,
that
class
of
cases
seize
to
be
the
class
of
cases
to
that
the
evarts
act
had
to
do
with
by
its
express
language.
now
over
the
years,
there
has
been
--
there
have
been
revisions
in
the
language
of
the
evarts
act,
revisions
of
amendments
and
codifications,
finally
getting
into
the
judicial
code
in
1948
and
as
a
result
there
has
been
debate
whether
the
court
of
appeals
can
entertain
an
appeal
from
interlocutory
injunctive
order
as
of
right
and
again
there
is
a
conflict.
the
ninth
circuit
and
one
of
the
other
circuits
holds
no
and
the
first
circuit
held
yes.
and
that
question
has
never
reached
this
court
because
it
was
never
to
anybody's
interest
to
bring
it
here.
now
i
am
not
debating
that
line
of
decisions
here,
it's
not
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
right
to
interlocutory
appeal
not
as
of
right
but
discretionary
under
the
act
of
1958.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh!
yes
and
that
if
the
court
please
is
why
i
do
not
ask
this
court
to
determine
whether
the
appeal
should
be
allowed.
i
merely
ask
this
court
to
tell
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
that
question
and
to
remand
this
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
to
determine
whether
we
should
have
an
appeal.
it's
well
established
i
think
that
if
lower
court
denies
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
therefore
refuses
to
exercise
it
this
court
can
tell
it
you
do
have
jurisdiction
now
exercise
it.
what
the
ninth
circuit
might
do
to
my
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
when
we
get
back
is
an
open
question,
but
it's
not
a
question
i
can
present
to
this
court.
now
the
government's
argument
here
has
been
that
the
expediting
act
is
a
special
act
and
that
1958
interlocutory
appeals
act
is
a
general
act
and
that
a
later
general
is
not
repeal
an
earlier
special
act
unless
it
is
very
specific,
but
the
error
in
that
argument
is
that
both
acts
are
special
acts
and
the
act
of
1958
repeals
nothing.
i
would
say
they
are
both
special
acts
in
this
sense.
the
expediting
act
of
1903
is
a
special
act
dealing
with
the
problem
of
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
in
a
specific
kind
of
case,
government
civil
antitrust.
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958
is
a
special
act
dealing
with
the
right
to
take
interlocutory
appeals
in
all
kinds
of
legislation.
no
repeal
of
the
expediting
act
is
involved
here
because
as
i
have
already
suggested
to
the
court
the
expediting
act
is
nothing
about
interlocutory
appeals.
now
the
reason,
the
reason
why
before
1958
there
was
no
right
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
a
government
antitrust
case
was
not
that
the
expediting
act
prohibited
it,
but
because
there
was
no
act
of
congress
which
authorized
it.
prior
to
1891
there
was
no
act
that
authorized
any
interlocutory
appeal.
then
we
had
an
act
that
authorized
interlocutory
appeals
on
injunctive
orders
to
a
court
that
had
a
jurisdiction
over
the
final
appeal,
but
not
until
1958
that
any
kind
of
law
or
statute
authorize
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
different
character.
so
the
act
of
1958
repeals
nothing,
it
added
something
brand
new
to
the
law,
something
which
the
courts
have
felt
would
be
useful
and
i
have
cited
in
the
brief,
a
statement
from
the
harvard
journal
on
legislation
that
the
judgment
of
the
congress
that
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
would
expedite
litigation
have
proved
to
be
sound
from
experience.
now
we
come
then
to
this
question,
that
government
has
relied
primarily
on
dictum,
language
of
justice
brandeis
in
united
states
versus
california
canneries,
the
famous
language
and
i
will
read
those
two
sentences
because
this
what
the
case
has
been
made
to
turn
on
by
the
court
below.
he
said
the
court
referring
to
the
provisions
concerning
appeal
prior
to
the
expediting
act,
these
provisions
governing
appeals
in
general
were
amended
by
the
expediting
act
so
that
the
suit
in
equity
under
the
antitrust
act
“in
which
the
united
is
complainant”
the
appeal
should
be
direct
to
this
court
from
the
final
decree
in
the
trial
court.
thus
congress
limited
the
right
of
review
to
an
appeal
from
the
decree
which
disposed
of
all
matters
and
have
precluded
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
to
either
court
from
an
interlocutory
decree.
that’s
the
language
my
adversary
seeks
to
fasten
on
us
as
somehow
disposing
of
this
case.
i
have
two
observations
i
wish
to
make
about
that
language
and
i
believe
both
them
are
very
(inaudible).
first
the
court
was
not
then
laying
down
any
rule
of
constitutional
law.
it
says
there
cannot
be
interlocutory
appeals
and
that
everything
must
be
decided
on
a
final
appeal.
it
was
laying
down
no
law
of
nature,
some
to
use
of
expression
of
mr.
justice
homes,
some
bruiting
omni
presence
in
the
sky.
it
was
saying
nothing
about
some
immutable
perpetual
restriction.
it
was
chief
speaking
about
(inaudible)
legislative
policy
on
the
state
of
the
statutes
in
1925
and
it
was
entirely
correct
in
what
it
said
because
since
congress
had
made
no
provision
for
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
it
provided
that
it
could
only
--
the
final
appeal
went
to
this
court
it
was
correct
there
was
no
way
to
get
an
interlocutory
appeal.
now
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
was
enacted
55
years
after
the
expediting
act,
about
30
years
after
the
california
canneries
case
was
a
sharp
break
with
former
attitudes
about
desirability
of
interlocutory
appeals.
as
i
have
already
suggested
it
was
a
new
departure
manifesting
erratically
different
attitude
toward
interlocutory
appeals
from
the
former
antipathy.
and
in
the
canneries
case
this
court
was
at
most
expressing
a
judgment
on
what
congress
had
done,
not
on
what
congress
could
do
or
what
might
be
doing
30
years
later.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
it
was.
mr.
moses
lasky
now
the
point
the
brown
shoe
was
that
it
was
pure
dictum.
the
question
was
not
--
that
was
not
the
question
in
brown
shoe.
the
question
in
brown
shoe
was
whether
a
decision
by
the
trial
court
in
an
acquisition
violated
the
law
before
it
had
created
a
remedy
was
sufficiently
final
to
permit
appeal
to
toll
and
the
court
held
it
was.
then
in
a
footnote,
it
had
this
statement.
now
as
to
that
of
course
it
is
well
settled
that
not
only
the
dictum
is
not
binding,
but
statements
made
in
a
context
in
which
the
matter
is
not
even
before
the
court
should
not
be
given
broad
and
exaggerated
value.
just
the
other
day
i
said
the
other
day,
in
may
of
this
year
in
kastigar
versus
the
united
states,
visited
here
which
is
reported
in
406
united
states
this
court
observed
that
broad
language,
particularly
in
dictum
and
in
the
context
of
ancillary
points,
not
essential
to
the
decision
of
the
court
has
no
weight.
now
not
only
was
brown
shoe
dictum
where
the
court
wasn't
dealing
with
the
question,
it
wasn't
presented
to
it
for
its
consideration
but
what
was
said
in
the
canneries
case
on
the
subject
was
also
a
dictum,
also
a
dictum
for
this
reason.
there
what
was
being
appealed
from
was
an
order
denying
a
motion
for
leave
to
intervene
after
a
final
decree,
the
united
states
versus
swift
&
company
and
it's
settled
law
that
a
post
judgment
order
on
appeal
from
a
post
judgment
order
is
not
an
interlocutory
appeal.
it
itself
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
order
which
this
court
has
held
in
el
paso
case,
one
of
the
el
paso
natural
gas
cases,
well,
settled
at
the
time
and
most
of
justice
brandeis’
opinion
was
pointing
that
out
if
that
was
a
final
order
therefore
the
appeal
lay
only
to
that
court.
mr.
moses
lasky
definitely.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
can
answer
that.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
expediting
act
was
enacted
under
certain
suppositions.
that
this
was
a
way
to
expedite
litigation
and
experience
has
shown
that
it
was
not.
secondly,
that
it
was
better
to
get
the
case
into
the
hands
of
this
court
and
bypass
the
courts
of
appeal
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
remarked
much
more
has
been
read
into
the
expediting
act
then
it
actually
contained.
now
we're
coming
now
to
questions
of
policy
and
as
to
this
i
think
my
adversaries
when
they
present
this
questions
of
policy
or
holding
the
sword
by
its
blade.
this
court
has
frequently
observed
that
it
appreciates,
i
can
make
good
use
of
the
screening
function
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
useful.
this
court
or
justices
of
this
court
have
more
than
once
in
the
last
few
years
observed
that
the
expediting
act
is
not
as
desirable
to
milly
(ph)
as
it
once
was.
now
we
have
an
act
here,
and
my
adversary
says
they
can
conceive
legislation
to
handle
the
problem
much
better
than
this
and
i
do
not
dispute,
the
congress
might
think
of
legislation
better
than
this,
but
i
say,
here
is
an
act
that
exists
and
what
aid
the
congress
has
given
to
this
court
should
not
be
spurned
even
if
there
maybe
foul.
now
let
me
address
myself
to
the
question
of
two
things
whether
this
is
an
anomalous
procedure
and
whether
it
would
impose
a
burden
on
this
court
instead
of
alleviating
a
burden
which
i
submit
is
the
case.
it
is
not
anomalous.
congress
has
a
right
to
experiment
on
appellate
procedure.
it
could
well
determine
that
interlocutory
appeals
are
helpful.
it
did
so
determined
experience
showed
it
was
right.
at
the
same
time
he
could
very
well
say
but
let
us
not
burden
supreme
court
with
interlocutory
appeals.
let
us
carry
them
through
the
court
of
appeals,
then
this
court
through
it
certiorari
jurisdiction
having
the
benefit
of
that
screening,
the
benefit
of
that
judgment
can
look
at
it
upon
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
determine
whether
it
deserves
further
review.
mr.
moses
lasky
it
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
to
this
court
at
the
end
of
the
whole
case
or
immediately
if
the
court
made
a
proper
order
i
think
it
is
under
rule
54,
i
don't
have
the
exact
rule
number,
but
could
have
specified
no
reason
for
delay
on
that
appeal,
that
is
true.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
in
other
this
court
remains
the
final
word
in
government
civil
antitrust
cases,
but
it
also
remains
the
final
word
in
every
other
case.
and
in
every
other
case
it
determines
that
question
whether
it
should
intervene
after
it
has
had
the
benefit
of
the
views
of
court
of
appeals.
the
procedure
that
i
say
submit
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
offers
is
that
it
can
do
the
same
here
and
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
extraordinarily
useful
if
the
courts
below
made
greater
use
of
this
kind
of
procedure.
now
there
are
other
arguments
that
have
been
presented
by
my
adversaries
and
i
approach
the
matter
from
a
standpoint
of
responding
to
adversaries
argument
because
it
seems
to
me
and
as
it
seemed
to
the
seventh
circuit
if
you
take
the
language
of
the
statute
on
his
face,
it
is
plainly
in
favor
of
the
interlocutory
appeal.
the
only
way
adversaries
read
the
language
to
eliminate
that
is
to
bring
the
bear
upon
an
erroneous
history
which
is
--
or
the
history
of
interlocutory
appeals
from
injunctive
orders.
now
one
other
argument
has
been
presented
by
solicitor
general's
office
which
is
that
interlocutory
appeals
from
injunctive
orders
deserve,
are
more
meritorious,
and
should
be
allowed
more
than
interlocutory
appeals
of
the
discretionary
type
that
the
1958
act
deals
with.
of
course
that
is
a
value
judgment,
they
start
with
that
premise.
and
they
say
that
no
interlocutory
appeal
lies
from
an
injunctive
order
in
a
government
antitrust
suit
and
it
would
be
very
anomalous
then
to
permit
it
to
lie
from
another
type
of
order.
this
is
one
of
the
major
arguments
made
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
it
has
several
flaws
about
it.
in
first
place,
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
an
injunction
does
--
an
appeal
does
not
lie
form
an
interlocutory
appeals
injunctive
order
in
a
government
antitrust
suit
under
28
u.s.c.
§
1292
(a).
now
1292
(a)
is
the
old
evarts
act
brought
up
to
date.
1292
(b)
is
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958.
there
was
a
difference.
where
you
have
an
appeal
under
1292
(a)
it
is
as
of
right
of
injunctive
orders,
receiverships.
to
have
an
appeal
under
1292
(b)
it
is
a
matter
of
joint
discretion
of
the
two
lower
courts.
now
it
is
not
at
all
settled
that
there
is
no
(inaudible)
as
of
right
from
an
injunctive
order
because
as
i
say
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
circuits
on
that
and
this
court
has
never
resolved
it.
but
assuming
that
you
cannot
have
an
appeal
from
an
injunctive
order
as
of
right
under
1292
(a)
then
you
do
have
that
right
under
1292
(b)
because
1292
(b)
says,
here
is
its
language,
“when
a
district
judge
in
making
in
a
civil
action
an
order
not
otherwise
appealable
under
this
section”
that’s
1292,
“then
the
1958
procedure
applies.”
so
that
the
argument
doesn’t
hold
up.
i
submit
the
matter
in
this
way.
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
of
1958
was
the
combination
of
a
growing
feeling
over
the
years
with
the
old,
hard
rule
against
interlocutory
appeals
was
injurious
to
the
administration
of
justice
and
it
opened
it
up.
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
repealed
nothing.
it
added
something
to
the
law.
on
a
face
of
the
statute
literally
it
allows
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
any
kind
of
civil
case
to
a
court
of
appeals
if
the
two
lower
courts
believe
it
isn't
a
appropriate
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
in
this
--
it
not
really
repealed
add
to
because
1292
(a)
is
a
right
to
appeal
as
a
right.
it
does
not
call
for
any
certification
by
the
district
court.
it
calls
for
no
permission
by
court
of
appeal.
then
had
an
order
to
--
in
order
to
come
in
under
1292
(b)
one
would
have
to
show
that
there
is
involved
a
controlling
question
of
law
upon
which
there
is
good
grounds
for
dispute.
i
think
and
that
the
decision
would
expedite
the
litigation.
those
were
the
tests
that
have
to
be
made
under
1292
(b)
that
do
not
have
to
be
made
under
1292
(a).
now
in
how
many
injunction,
preliminary
injunction
cases,
matters
that
would
--
you
could
meet
those
tests,
i
do
not
know.
i
think
you
might
often
be
able
to
do
so
because
an
interlocutory
injunction
as
was
observed,
i
think
by
mr.
justice
fortas
in
one
of
the
cases
in
this
court,
granted
in
a
section
7
case
often
has
the
effect
of
terminating
the
transaction
and
terminating
litigation.
so
that
i
submit
that
the
statute
on
its
face
allows
an
interlocutory
appeal.
i
submit
that
the
statute,
so
interpreted,
so
applied
would
go
along
way
to
alleviate
the
burden
of
this
court,
would
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
the
screening
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
do
not
dispute
that
congress
might
well
look
at
it
again
and
determine
what
other
relief
would
be
in
order,
but
that
is
no
reason
to
spurn
the
relief
which
congress
has
presently
given
to
us.
thank
you.
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
if
the
court
please,
i
have
to
submit.
