mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
a
witness
was
subpoenaed
from
penitentiary,
the
federal
penitentiary
in
leavenworth
kansas,
and
subpoenaed
down
into
texas
or
florida
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
put
in
detention
while
he
is
waiting.
does
he
get
$21.00
a
day?
that’s
in
your
theory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he’s
attending
the
trial
then.
he’s
in
attendance
for
the
purposes
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
trial
going
on?
was
there
a
trial
going
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
correct
that
if
they
were
not
being
held
in
jail,
they
would
be
or
would
have
been
deported
by
now?
chief

(voice

chief

e.

mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
resume
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
their
convictions
i
take
it
followed
the
events
we’re
talking
about,
did
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
were
not
under
conviction
while
they
were
being
held?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
were,
under
my
point
that
i'm
driving
at
is,
if
they
were
under
the
sentence
it
could’ve
been
held
without
any
question
of
reason
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see,
but
it
could’ve
done
otherwise
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
sentence
had
not
been
suspended
until
after
these
events,
you
wouldn’t
be
here
on
this
case
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
of
the
after
trial
period.
after
they’d
have
been
found
guilty
if
instead
of
suspending
the
sentence,
the
judge
had
put
them
in
the
same
building
and
said,
“i’ll
consider
motion
for
modification
of
the
sentence
and
suspension
of
the
sentence
after
you
testified?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
armendariz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
say
that
we
cannot
judicially
notice
the
records
of
the
united
states’
district
court.
so,
that
these
people
were
found,
were
were
charged,
indicted,
found
guilty
for
entered
a
guilty
plea
and
that
they
were
sentenced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you’ve
come
now
--
there’s
quite
a
difference
between
a
classification
that
differs
between
the
generality
of
the
citizens
and
aliens
who've
been
found
guilty
of
illegally
entering
the
country
and
had
been
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
that
purpose,
even
though
that
sentence
was
suspended.
your
burden
is
to
show
that
that’s
an
irrational
classification,
isn’t?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
maximum
money
fine
that
could
be
imposed
on
an
alien
in
these
circumstances
illegally
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
how
much
is
the
most
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
$500.00
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
what's
your
suggesting
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
speaking
of
these
plaintiffs
right
here,
that
your
petitioners
there.
how
much
they
have
been
fined
for
the
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
if
the
judge
had
fined
them
$500.00
and
six
months
then
he
could
take
--
if
you're
right
on
your
argument
you
could
--
the
government
could
nevertheless
take
the
$20.00
a
day
out
of
that
$500.00,
couldn’t
they,
as
an
offset?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
you’re
suggesting
a
premium
on
judges
to
impose
the
maximum
sentence
in
every
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
the
cases
we’re
dealing
with,
they
did
not
fall
because
there
were
verdicts
or
there
were
judgments
of
guilty
by
some
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
