mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
troublesome
case
and
it
is
good
i
think
that
the
problem
has
been
brought
to
light.
whether
there
is
anything
that
this
court
can
properly
or
should
do
about
it
is
and
not
so
clear.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me
important
to
put
before
the
court
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
basis
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
there
is
in
the
appendix,
the
original
complaint
beginning
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
and
there
is
also
a
first
amended
complaint
beginning
on
page
28
of
the
appendix.
it
isn’t
wholly
clear
to
me
which
one
is
actually
the
one
upon
which
the
district
court
acted,
but
i
would
assume
that
the
first
amended
complaint
is
the
one
which
is
before
the
court.
the
united
states
is
the
sole
defendant
named
in
this
complaint.
there
is
no
officer
of
the
united
states,
no
marshal,
and
no
united
states
attorney,
and
no
cabinet
officer,
and
no
one,
but
the
united
states
is
named
as
a
defendant.
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
paragraph
two
it
says,
“that
this
suit
seeks
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
a
federal
statute
to
title
28
u.s.c.
1821
and
it
requests
a
three-judge
court.”
and
then
if
you
look
at
paragraph
three,
you
will
find
that
it
is
alleged
that
there
is
a
case
of
actual
controversy
and
there
is
a
reference
to
the
declaratory
judgment
statute.
now,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
congress
has
never
consented
to
a
suit
by
citizen
or
an
alien
against
the
united
states
to
enjoin
the
united
states
from
anything.
it
may
have
in
some
special
acts,
but
it
has
not
in
any
statute
which
is
applicable
here.
and
similarly,
i
think
that
sovereign
immunity
is
a
barrier
to
a
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment
against
the
united
states
unless
the
case
is
in
some
other
way
brought
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
when
we
examined
the
statutes
which
relate
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
the
only
one
which
can
have
any
application
here
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
is
the
question.
yes,
i
say
it
is.
i
say
that
it
is
quite
clear
it
seems
to
me
that
this
cannot
be
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
united
states
because
the
united
states
is
not
consented
to
any
such
suit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
think
that
there
any
officer
of
the
united
states
has
authority
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
congress
has
power
to,
and
the
only
place
that
i
know
of
that
congress
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
suits
against
united
states.
this
section
1346
of
title
28
and
the
first
provision
of
that
is
internal
revenue
tax
cases
and
the
second
is
the
tucker
act.
now,
the
tucker
act
provides
that
the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
in
any
claim
not
exceeding
$10,000.00
and
incidentally
in
order
to
come
in
with
respect
to
federal
question.
it
would
have
to
exceed
$10,000.00
which
is
simply
another
technical
reason
why
quite
apart
from
federal
--
from
sovereign
immunity
that
would
not
be
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
understand
and
i'm
trying
to
narrow
it
down
and
say
that
this
case
is
solely
and
simple
a
case
under
the
tucker
act,
section
1346
(a)
(2).
there
is
section
1346
(b)
which
is
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
this
does
not
purport
to
be
such
a
suit
though
conceivably
someone
might
contend
that
there
was
a
basis
for
that
nor
does
it
purport
to
be
a
suit
with
respect
to
civil
rights
act.
so,
i
am
suggesting
that
this
case
can
be
before
the
district
court
and
can
be
considered
by
this
court,
not
as
a
question
of
enjoining
anything.
it
is
not
a
question
whether
if
the
people
are
now
in
custody
they
can
be
held
--
conceivably
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
might
be
filed
to
release
someone
on
the
ground
that
detention
under
section
46
(b)
without
proper
compensation
violates
some
provision
of
the
constitution.
these
people
are
not
now
in
custody.
they
have
been
released
sometime
since
and
so
this
is
and
perhaps
i
shouldn’t
have
taken
this
much
time
to
bring
this
out,
but
i
think
it
is
important.
this
case
is
before
the
district
court,
and
therefore,
here
only
as
a
suit
under
the
tucker
act
which
means
that
it
must
be
not
exceeding
$10,000.00
in
amount,
founded
either
upon
the
constitution
or
any
act
of
congress,
or
any
regulations
of
an
executive
department,
or
upon
any
express
or
implied
contract
with
the
united
states
in
cases
not
sounding
in
torts.
well,
now
it
obviously
is
not
upon
an
express
or
implied
contract
nor
does
it
rest
on
a
regulation
of
an
executive
department.
so,
it
has
to
be
in
order
to
allow
recovery
have
founded
either
upon
the
constitution
for
any
act
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
understand
that
and
so
that
gets
us
down
to
--
there
is
also
a
lot
of
other
things
that
will
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
within
the
--
that
is
within
the
tucker
act
but
the
act
of
congress
is
section
1821.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
so
we
are
now
confronted
with
the
problem
of
construing
section
1821
and
my
opponent
contends
that
the
proper
construction
of
that
is
that
it
provides
for
a
per
diem
of
$21.00
per
day
to
the
detained
witness
and
this
court
can
of
course
make
a
statute
mean
anything
it
feels
that
it
ought
to
mean,
but
i
find
it
extraordinarily
difficult
to
find
that
that
is
either
the
literal
proper
construction
of
the
statute
or
that
it
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
which
can
be
supported
in
terms
of
its
history
or
the
practice
under
it.
we
--
before
i
go
further.
i
think
it
is
not
unimportant
to
have
the
facts
of
this
case
somewhat
more
fully
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
if
it
is
unconstitutional,
i
find
no
basis
for
sustaining
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
tucker
act
permits
a
claim
if
it
is
based
upon
the
constitution,
but
suppose
you
find
the
statute
unconstitutional.
what
basis
is
there
for
awarding
a
judgment
against
the
united
states?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
one
little
trouble
that
fifth
amendment
has
no
equal
protection
clause,
that’s
a
problem
with
the
court
has
wrestled
with
and
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
various
circumstances.
moreover,
even
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
you
have
the
question
of
proper
classification
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
where
the
facts
i
would
like
to
put
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
would
be
a
tucker
act
case,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
would
not
agree
that
was
the
solution
or
analysis.
yes!
it
is
a
tucker
act
case.
i'm
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don’t
see
how
it
can
be
limited
solely
to
that
although
that
of
course
was
--
is
i
suppose
a
large
part
of
the
basis
of
upon
which
suits
under
the
constitution
are
brought
either
in
district
courts
for
less
than
$10,000.00
or
in
the
court
of
claims
for
greater
sums.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
gets
$20.00
a
day.
yes,
that
would
seem
to
be
that.
if
the
court
concludes
that
on
the
constitutional
claim
some
kind
of
automatic
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
equality
is
required
despite
the
basis
for
proper
classification
which
i
would
like
to
put
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
not
irrelevant
that
all
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
and
far
as
anything
appears
and
i
don’t
understand
class
actions,
particularly
as
applied
to
this
sort
of
a
situation,
as
far
as
it
appeared
with
respect
to
the
numerous
people
who
are
said
to
be
of
the
same
class
involved,
but
of
all
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
people
who
illegally
enter
the
united
states,
who
were
arrested
together
with
the
people
who
bought
them
into
the
united
states,
who
were
under
the
benign
policy
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
treated
very
gently
as
illegal
immigrants,
but
whose
services
were
wanted
for
the
purpose
of
proceeding
against
those
who
were
apparently
engaged
in
the
business
of
bringing
a
mexicans
into
the
united
states
illegally.
all
of
the
people
involved
in
this
case
were
subject
to
deportation.
all
of
them
were
proceeded
against
criminally
and
were
convicted
of
the
crime
of
illegal
entry.
all
of
them
were
given
a
sentence
of
a
year,
but
placed
on
immediate
probation.
and
i
would
like
to
call
attention
not
only
to
rule
46
(b)
which
after
all
is
a
rule
of
this
court
and
must
at
sometime
have
obtained
approval
by
this
court
and
there
are
cited
in
our
brief
of
various
cases
which
support
the
holding
of
the
witnesses
who
will
not
otherwise
be
available
for
criminal
trial.
and
the
brief
also
shows
that
this
goes
back
to
the
very
earliest
days
of
the
republic
under
the
constitution,
statutes
passed
in
1789,
recognize
that
people
could
be
held
as
material
witnesses
and
it
has
always
been
done.
the
business
of
payment
has
had
an
experience
of
what
i
would
call
neglect.
back
in
1850
a
120
years
ago,
there
was
provided
a
separate
fee
of
a
$1.00
a
day
for
witnesses
held
in
custody
and
at
that
time,
there
was
provided
a
fee
of,
i
think,
a
dollar-and-a-half
a
day
for
other
witnesses.
over
the
years.
but
only
really
within
the
past
20
years,
the
regular
witness
fee
has
escalated
and
has
got
now
to
$20.00
a
day
plus
$16.00
a
day
for
subsistence.
but
no
one
has
ever
changed
the
dollar
a
day
for
people
who
are
held
in
custody
except
that
in
1948
even
that
was
omitted
when
the
judicial
code
was
revised
in
1948.
and
a
year
or
two
later,
in
a
comprehensive
amendment
to
the
judicial
code
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
errors
which
were
made
when
it
was
put
together.
the
dollar
a
day
was
put
back
in.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
know
but
i
don’t
think
so.
i
--
my
guess
is
that
they
just
went
ahead
and
paid
them
a
dollar
a
day
on
the
ground
that
this
was
going
to
be
straightened
out
any
how.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
relevant
to
point
out
as
we
have
in
our
brief
on
page
31.
that
section
1821
is
not
the
only
statute
and
this
i
think
has
some
bearing
on
the
construction
of
section
1821,
is
not
the
only
statute
which
provides
for
detaining
persons
in
this
situation
at
a
fee
of
one
dollar
a
day.
this
is
printed
in
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
half
of
page
31.
the
attorney
general
under
such
conditions,
as
our
regulations
prescribe
may
stay
the
deportation
of
any
alien
deportable
under
this
section
and
these
aliens
were,
if
in
his
judgment,
the
testimony
of
such
alien
is
necessary
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
the
prosecution
of
offenders
against
any
provision
of
this
chapter
or
other
laws
of
the
united
states,
all
of
these
people
were
held
for
the
purpose
of
being
available
to
testify
against
the
people
who
introduce
them
into
the
united
states.
all
of
those
persons
who
were
prosecuted
pleaded
guilty
and
all
of
these
persons
were
discharged
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
that
criminal
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
insofar
as
this
case
turns
under
the
tucker
act
on
the
construction
of
a
statute
and
we
have
referred
primarily
to
section
1821,
but
i
have
also
mentioned
the
corresponding
immigration
statute,
title
8
section
1227
(d).
i
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
a
construction
of
the
statute
which
would
lead
to
the
payment
of
$21.00
a
day
to
these
detained
witnesses.
not
only
is
that
not
a
feasible
or
reasonable
construction
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
the
contrary
is
provided
by
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
justice
which
are
printed
on
page
16
of
our
brief.
incidentally,
i
would
call
particular
attention
to
the
second
paragraph
of
the
united
states
marshal’s
manual
of
the
department
of
justice.
“witnesses
detained
under
rule
46
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures
should
be
paid
the
compensation
of
$1.00
per
day
except
for
the
days
they
attend
in
court.
when
they
are
entitled
to
the
regular
witness
fee
of
$20.00
and
the
same
construction
appears
in
this
record.
and
the
answer
of
the
united
states
attorney
which
since
the
defendant,
since
the
respondent
or
the
petitioner
here
had
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
this
is
on
page
23
of
the
appendix
where
the
united
states
attorney
alleged
that
it
was
the
practice
to
pay
$1.00
in
these
cases,
but
whenever
a
witness
who
is
detained
in
custody
is
in
attendance
in
court
or
before
a
united
states
commissioner
or
before
a
person
authorized
to
take
his
deposition,
he
receives
the
witness
fee
of
$20.00
for
each
days
attendance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
--
here
again,
i
m
not
wholly
clear
but
there
were
joint
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
when
the
matter
is
before
the
court
on
joint
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
is
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
material
issue
of
fact
in
either
way.
and
i
would
--
i
had
in
mind
the
fact
that
it
was
the
government’s
motion
which
was
granted,
but
there
was
also
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
petitioners
here
and
i
don’t
greatly
care
whether
this
is
regarded
as
admitted
or
not.
i
believe
that
it
is
the
practice
and
that
that
is
plainly
evidenced
by
the
united
states
attorney’s
--
united
states
marshal’s
manual
which
is
printed
on
page
16.
if
there
is
a
question
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
so
construed,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
the
answer
is
that
this
court
should
somehow
or
rather
rewrite
the
statute
and
provide
that
an
amount
should
be
paid.
suggestion
has
been
made
in
equal
protection
terms.
if
they
are
applicable
to
the
federal
government
and
i
have
tried
to
argue
in
our
position
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
any
sort
of
a
witness
fee,
and
that
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
classification
or
discrimination
here
with
respect
to
people
like
these
particular
petitioners
who
were
themselves
violators
of
the
law,
who
were
subject
to
a
one
year
sentence
in
jail,
whose
grant
of
probation
was
coincident
with
the
holding
as
material
witnesses,
and
who
were
then
held
until
people
who
introduced
them
into
the
united
states
pleaded
guilty
and
were
then
immediately
discharged.
as
i
understand
the
situation,
no
one
of
these
petitioners
was
paid
$20.00
for
any
day
because
no
one
of
these
petitioners
appeared
in
court
because
the
people
who
introduced
them
into
the
united
states
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
chief
justice
the
dates
are
stated
on
pages
8,
9,
and
10,
but
the
chronology
is
a
little,
certainly
too
difficult
for
me
to
keep
in
mind
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
were
under
the
sentence
and
it
could
have
been
held
except
that
the
sentence
granted
immediate
probation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
could
have
done
otherwise
and
was
i
am
sure
done
as
a
part
of
the
process
by
which
they
were
dealt
with
and
then
held
until
the
people
who
introduced
them
into
the
united
states
came
to
trial
which
in
one
case
was
about
six
weeks
later
and
in
another
case
was
about
a
month.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
wouldn’t
be
any
problem
of
--
as
to
this,
except
conceivably
under
the
bail
reform
act.
they
might
have
been
entitled
to
bail
before
trial.
whereas
here
they
were
in
fact
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
after
the
trial
there
would
have
been
no
problem
about
that
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that’s
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
same
day
as
executed.
my
interpretation
is
that
it’s
all
part
of
one
process
and
designed
to
deal
appropriately
with
these
people
who
had
broken
the
law
and
to
provide
the
evidence
which
is
necessary
to
appear
against
the
other
persons
who
have
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
there
hadn’t
been
a
suspension
there
would
be
any
problem.
now,
let
me
say
as
i
indicated
in
our
brief
in
our
position
that
i
have
tried
to
do
a
little
good
in
this
matter.
i
have
called
it
to
the
attention
of
the
deputy
attorney
general
and
of
the
attorney
general
and
it
has
proceeded
this
far.
that
on
january
10,
1973,
the
attorney
general
sent
a
letter
addressed
to
the
speaker,
a
corresponding
letter
to
the
vice
president,
but
the
letter
has
not
yet
been
sent
to
this
speaker
or
to
the
vice
president.
the
form
i
have
has
a
big
rubber
stamp
on
it
to
budget
for
clearance
not
sent
to
congress
and
under
the
form,
there
has
to
be
clearance
from
the
office
of
management
and
budget
the
last
paragraph
of
the
letter
says,
“the
office
of
management
and
budget
has
advised
that
enactment
of
this
legislation
is
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
this
administration.”
now,
when
clearance
is
obtained
from
the
office
of
management
and
budget
and
my
influence
is
that
office
is
not
always
very
great,
but
the
attorney
general
has
recommended
it
to
them.
if
it
is
obtained
then
this
proposal
will
be
sent
to
congress.
the
proposal
as
is
indicated
raises
the
$1.00
per
day
in
both
places,
that
is
both
in
section
1821
and
in
the
immigration
provision
to
$20.00
per
day.
it
also
takes
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
make
a
change
in
the
provision
with
respect
to
transportation
cost
for
ordinary
witnesses
where
the
statute
now
provides
that
it
should
be
first
class
and
the
suggestion
is
made
that
in
modern
times
the
economy
class
airfare
is
adequate
and
they
are
doing
that.
however,
i
am
told
that
this
will
be
simply
a
means
of
putting
it
before
congress
if
it
gets
before
congress
and
that
the
department
may
well
not
support
the
full
$20.00
a
day
and
there
is
a
really
real
problem
here
which
needs
to
be
considered.
$20.00
a
day
for
30
days
in
a
month
is
$600.00
a
month
and
in
this
particular
area
of
mexico,
70%
of
the
people
have
an
income
of
less
than
$80.00
a
month.
and
there
is
great
concern
that
if
we
provide
a
build
in
way
to
make
$600.00
a
month
by
illegally
entering
the
united
states
and
being
detained
as
a
witness
that
the
number
of
people
who
do
this
maybe
very
greatly
increased.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
maybe
detained
as
a
visitor?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
a
prisoner,
yes.
but,
if
that
is
works
out
to
be
eight
times
as
much
as
you
can
make
working
in
the
fields
in
mexico,
it
may
look
pretty
good
and
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
if
this
does
come
before
congress
that
representatives
of
the
department
will
recommend
that
there
be
added
a
proviso
to
this
effect.
this
wording
is
not
final,
but
it
explains
the
idea
provided
that
any
alien
who
has
entered
the
country
illegally
and
who
is
held
not
more
than
30
days
as
a
material
witness
in
a
case
involving
the
illegal
entrance
of
himself
or
another
or
any
violation
of
the
immigration
law
shall
receive
only
$5.00
per
day
for
such
period
of
incarceration
when
not
attending
in
court.
and
this
i
mention,
because
it
seems
to
me
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
is
a
problem
which
ought
not
to
be
resolved
in
some
kind
of
rigid
constitutional
terms
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
everybody
be
treated
the
same.
that
it
obviously
has
practical
connotations.
this
is
not
just
a
mechanical
thing,
but
the
protection
of
our
borders
against
the
introduction
of
illegal
immigrants
who
compete
for
jobs
against
american
citizens
in
areas
where
jobs
are
not
readily
available.
it
is
a
legitimate
matter
of
american
policy.
it
is
a
matter
which
can
appropriately
receive
the
attention
and
consideration
of
congress
and
which
seems
to
me
in
a
proper
allocation
of
function
should
be
determined
in
detail
by
the
congress
and
not
by
this
court.
now,
it
is
very
appropriate
i
think
that
the
issue
has
been
raised
and
that
steps
are
being
taken
so
that
it
will
be
put
before
congress
for
active
consideration
there.
i
would
think
that
the
ultimate
resolution
of
the
problem
would
be
better
in
the
hands
of
congress
then
by
any
solution
which
it
seems
to
me
this
court
can
make.
this
court
cannot
spell
out
a
detailed
statute
which
will
say,
“well
in
case
of
illegal
immigrants
and
so
on.”
the
only
analogy
that
has
been
suggested
for
proceeding
by
this
court
is
in
terms
of
some
equal
protection
idea
which
idea
i
think
is
not
relevant
here
in
the
fact
of
this
case.
accordingly,
we
would
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
pleases,
i
would
lodge
this
submission
to
the
budget
bureau
with
the
clerk
so
that
the
clerk
will
have
the
information
available.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
assume
that
it
would
get
--
well,
it
could
be
made
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
could
be
made
retroactive
but
the
proposal
is
simply
prospective
and
whether
anything
will
come
of
this,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
troublesome
case
and
it
is
good
i
think
that
the
problem
has
been
brought
to
light.
whether
there
is
anything
that
this
court
can
properly
or
should
do
about
it
is
and
not
so
clear.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me
important
to
put
before
the
court
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
basis
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
there
is
in
the
appendix,
the
original
complaint
beginning
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
and
there
is
also
a
first
amended
complaint
beginning
on
page
28
of
the
appendix.
it
isn’t
wholly
clear
to
me
which
one
is
actually
the
one
upon
which
the
district
court
acted,
but
i
would
assume
that
the
first
amended
complaint
is
the
one
which
is
before
the
court.
the
united
states
is
the
sole
defendant
named
in
this
complaint.
there
is
no
officer
of
the
united
states,
no
marshal,
and
no
united
states
attorney,
and
no
cabinet
officer,
and
no
one,
but
the
united
states
is
named
as
a
defendant.
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
paragraph
two
it
says,
“that
this
suit
seeks
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
a
federal
statute
to
title
28
u.s.c.
1821
and
it
requests
a
three-judge
court.”
and
then
if
you
look
at
paragraph
three,
you
will
find
that
it
is
alleged
that
there
is
a
case
of
actual
controversy
and
there
is
a
reference
to
the
declaratory
judgment
statute.
now,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
congress
has
never
consented
to
a
suit
by
citizen
or
an
alien
against
the
united
states
to
enjoin
the
united
states
from
anything.
it
may
have
in
some
special
acts,
but
it
has
not
in
any
statute
which
is
applicable
here.
and
similarly,
i
think
that
sovereign
immunity
is
a
barrier
to
a
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment
against
the
united
states
unless
the
case
is
in
some
other
way
brought
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
when
we
examined
the
statutes
which
relate
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
the
only
one
which
can
have
any
application
here
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
is
the
question.
yes,
i
say
it
is.
i
say
that
it
is
quite
clear
it
seems
to
me
that
this
cannot
be
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
united
states
because
the
united
states
is
not
consented
to
any
such
suit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
think
that
there
any
officer
of
the
united
states
has
authority
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
congress
has
power
to,
and
the
only
place
that
i
know
of
that
congress
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
suits
against
united
states.
this
section
1346
of
title
28
and
the
first
provision
of
that
is
internal
revenue
tax
cases
and
the
second
is
the
tucker
act.
now,
the
tucker
act
provides
that
the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
in
any
claim
not
exceeding
$10,000.00
and
incidentally
in
order
to
come
in
with
respect
to
federal
question.
it
would
have
to
exceed
$10,000.00
which
is
simply
another
technical
reason
why
quite
apart
from
federal
--
from
sovereign
immunity
that
would
not
be
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
understand
and
i'm
trying
to
narrow
it
down
and
say
that
this
case
is
solely
and
simple
a
case
under
the
tucker
act,
section
1346
(a)
(2).
there
is
section
1346
(b)
which
is
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
this
does
not
purport
to
be
such
a
suit
though
conceivably
someone
might
contend
that
there
was
a
basis
for
that
nor
does
it
purport
to
be
a
suit
with
respect
to
civil
rights
act.
so,
i
am
suggesting
that
this
case
can
be
before
the
district
court
and
can
be
considered
by
this
court,
not
as
a
question
of
enjoining
anything.
it
is
not
a
question
whether
if
the
people
are
now
in
custody
they
can
be
held
--
conceivably
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
might
be
filed
to
release
someone
on
the
ground
that
detention
under
section
46
(b)
without
proper
compensation
violates
some
provision
of
the
constitution.
these
people
are
not
now
in
custody.
they
have
been
released
sometime
since
and
so
this
is
and
perhaps
i
shouldn’t
have
taken
this
much
time
to
bring
this
out,
but
i
think
it
is
important.
this
case
is
before
the
district
court,
and
therefore,
here
only
as
a
suit
under
the
tucker
act
which
means
that
it
must
be
not
exceeding
$10,000.00
in
amount,
founded
either
upon
the
constitution
or
any
act
of
congress,
or
any
regulations
of
an
executive
department,
or
upon
any
express
or
implied
contract
with
the
united
states
in
cases
not
sounding
in
torts.
well,
now
it
obviously
is
not
upon
an
express
or
implied
contract
nor
does
it
rest
on
a
regulation
of
an
executive
department.
so,
it
has
to
be
in
order
to
allow
recovery
have
founded
either
upon
the
constitution
for
any
act
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
understand
that
and
so
that
gets
us
down
to
--
there
is
also
a
lot
of
other
things
that
will
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
within
the
--
that
is
within
the
tucker
act
but
the
act
of
congress
is
section
1821.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
so
we
are
now
confronted
with
the
problem
of
construing
section
1821
and
my
opponent
contends
that
the
proper
construction
of
that
is
that
it
provides
for
a
per
diem
of
$21.00
per
day
to
the
detained
witness
and
this
court
can
of
course
make
a
statute
mean
anything
it
feels
that
it
ought
to
mean,
but
i
find
it
extraordinarily
difficult
to
find
that
that
is
either
the
literal
proper
construction
of
the
statute
or
that
it
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
which
can
be
supported
in
terms
of
its
history
or
the
practice
under
it.
we
--
before
i
go
further.
i
think
it
is
not
unimportant
to
have
the
facts
of
this
case
somewhat
more
fully
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
if
it
is
unconstitutional,
i
find
no
basis
for
sustaining
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
tucker
act
permits
a
claim
if
it
is
based
upon
the
constitution,
but
suppose
you
find
the
statute
unconstitutional.
what
basis
is
there
for
awarding
a
judgment
against
the
united
states?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
one
little
trouble
that
fifth
amendment
has
no
equal
protection
clause,
that’s
a
problem
with
the
court
has
wrestled
with
and
in
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
various
circumstances.
moreover,
even
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
you
have
the
question
of
proper
classification
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
where
the
facts
i
would
like
to
put
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
would
be
a
tucker
act
case,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
would
not
agree
that
was
the
solution
or
analysis.
yes!
it
is
a
tucker
act
case.
i'm
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don’t
see
how
it
can
be
limited
solely
to
that
although
that
of
course
was
--
is
i
suppose
a
large
part
of
the
basis
of
upon
which
suits
under
the
constitution
are
brought
either
in
district
courts
for
less
than
$10,000.00
or
in
the
court
of
claims
for
greater
sums.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
gets
$20.00
a
day.
yes,
that
would
seem
to
be
that.
if
the
court
concludes
that
on
the
constitutional
claim
some
kind
of
automatic
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
equality
is
required
despite
the
basis
for
proper
classification
which
i
would
like
to
put
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
not
irrelevant
that
all
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
and
far
as
anything
appears
and
i
don’t
understand
class
actions,
particularly
as
applied
to
this
sort
of
a
situation,
as
far
as
it
appeared
with
respect
to
the
numerous
people
who
are
said
to
be
of
the
same
class
involved,
but
of
all
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
people
who
illegally
enter
the
united
states,
who
were
arrested
together
with
the
people
who
bought
them
into
the
united
states,
who
were
under
the
benign
policy
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
treated
very
gently
as
illegal
immigrants,
but
whose
services
were
wanted
for
the
purpose
of
proceeding
against
those
who
were
apparently
engaged
in
the
business
of
bringing
a
mexicans
into
the
united
states
illegally.
all
of
the
people
involved
in
this
case
were
subject
to
deportation.
all
of
them
were
proceeded
against
criminally
and
were
convicted
of
the
crime
of
illegal
entry.
all
of
them
were
given
a
sentence
of
a
year,
but
placed
on
immediate
probation.
and
i
would
like
to
call
attention
not
only
to
rule
46
(b)
which
after
all
is
a
rule
of
this
court
and
must
at
sometime
have
obtained
approval
by
this
court
and
there
are
cited
in
our
brief
of
various
cases
which
support
the
holding
of
the
witnesses
who
will
not
otherwise
be
available
for
criminal
trial.
and
the
brief
also
shows
that
this
goes
back
to
the
very
earliest
days
of
the
republic
under
the
constitution,
statutes
passed
in
1789,
recognize
that
people
could
be
held
as
material
witnesses
and
it
has
always
been
done.
the
business
of
payment
has
had
an
experience
of
what
i
would
call
neglect.
back
in
1850
a
120
years
ago,
there
was
provided
a
separate
fee
of
a
$1.00
a
day
for
witnesses
held
in
custody
and
at
that
time,
there
was
provided
a
fee
of,
i
think,
a
dollar-and-a-half
a
day
for
other
witnesses.
over
the
years.
but
only
really
within
the
past
20
years,
the
regular
witness
fee
has
escalated
and
has
got
now
to
$20.00
a
day
plus
$16.00
a
day
for
subsistence.
but
no
one
has
ever
changed
the
dollar
a
day
for
people
who
are
held
in
custody
except
that
in
1948
even
that
was
omitted
when
the
judicial
code
was
revised
in
1948.
and
a
year
or
two
later,
in
a
comprehensive
amendment
to
the
judicial
code
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
errors
which
were
made
when
it
was
put
together.
the
dollar
a
day
was
put
back
in.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
know
but
i
don’t
think
so.
i
--
my
guess
is
that
they
just
went
ahead
and
paid
them
a
dollar
a
day
on
the
ground
that
this
was
going
to
be
straightened
out
any
how.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
relevant
to
point
out
as
we
have
in
our
brief
on
page
31.
that
section
1821
is
not
the
only
statute
and
this
i
think
has
some
bearing
on
the
construction
of
section
1821,
is
not
the
only
statute
which
provides
for
detaining
persons
in
this
situation
at
a
fee
of
one
dollar
a
day.
this
is
printed
in
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
half
of
page
31.
the
attorney
general
under
such
conditions,
as
our
regulations
prescribe
may
stay
the
deportation
of
any
alien
deportable
under
this
section
and
these
aliens
were,
if
in
his
judgment,
the
testimony
of
such
alien
is
necessary
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
the
prosecution
of
offenders
against
any
provision
of
this
chapter
or
other
laws
of
the
united
states,
all
of
these
people
were
held
for
the
purpose
of
being
available
to
testify
against
the
people
who
introduce
them
into
the
united
states.
all
of
those
persons
who
were
prosecuted
pleaded
guilty
and
all
of
these
persons
were
discharged
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
that
criminal
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
insofar
as
this
case
turns
under
the
tucker
act
on
the
construction
of
a
statute
and
we
have
referred
primarily
to
section
1821,
but
i
have
also
mentioned
the
corresponding
immigration
statute,
title
8
section
1227
(d).
i
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
a
construction
of
the
statute
which
would
lead
to
the
payment
of
$21.00
a
day
to
these
detained
witnesses.
not
only
is
that
not
a
feasible
or
reasonable
construction
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
the
contrary
is
provided
by
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
justice
which
are
printed
on
page
16
of
our
brief.
incidentally,
i
would
call
particular
attention
to
the
second
paragraph
of
the
united
states
marshal’s
manual
of
the
department
of
justice.
“witnesses
detained
under
rule
46
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures
should
be
paid
the
compensation
of
$1.00
per
day
except
for
the
days
they
attend
in
court.
when
they
are
entitled
to
the
regular
witness
fee
of
$20.00
and
the
same
construction
appears
in
this
record.
and
the
answer
of
the
united
states
attorney
which
since
the
defendant,
since
the
respondent
or
the
petitioner
here
had
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
this
is
on
page
23
of
the
appendix
where
the
united
states
attorney
alleged
that
it
was
the
practice
to
pay
$1.00
in
these
cases,
but
whenever
a
witness
who
is
detained
in
custody
is
in
attendance
in
court
or
before
a
united
states
commissioner
or
before
a
person
authorized
to
take
his
deposition,
he
receives
the
witness
fee
of
$20.00
for
each
days
attendance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
--
here
again,
i
m
not
wholly
clear
but
there
were
joint
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
when
the
matter
is
before
the
court
on
joint
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
is
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
material
issue
of
fact
in
either
way.
and
i
would
--
i
had
in
mind
the
fact
that
it
was
the
government’s
motion
which
was
granted,
but
there
was
also
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
petitioners
here
and
i
don’t
greatly
care
whether
this
is
regarded
as
admitted
or
not.
i
believe
that
it
is
the
practice
and
that
that
is
plainly
evidenced
by
the
united
states
attorney’s
--
united
states
marshal’s
manual
which
is
printed
on
page
16.
if
there
is
a
question
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
so
construed,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
the
answer
is
that
this
court
should
somehow
or
rather
rewrite
the
statute
and
provide
that
an
amount
should
be
paid.
suggestion
has
been
made
in
equal
protection
terms.
if
they
are
applicable
to
the
federal
government
and
i
have
tried
to
argue
in
our
position
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
any
sort
of
a
witness
fee,
and
that
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
classification
or
discrimination
here
with
respect
to
people
like
these
particular
petitioners
who
were
themselves
violators
of
the
law,
who
were
subject
to
a
one
year
sentence
in
jail,
whose
grant
of
probation
was
coincident
with
the
holding
as
material
witnesses,
and
who
were
then
held
until
people
who
introduced
them
into
the
united
states
pleaded
guilty
and
were
then
immediately
discharged.
as
i
understand
the
situation,
no
one
of
these
petitioners
was
paid
$20.00
for
any
day
because
no
one
of
these
petitioners
appeared
in
court
because
the
people
who
introduced
them
into
the
united
states
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
chief
justice
the
dates
are
stated
on
pages
8,
9,
and
10,
but
the
chronology
is
a
little,
certainly
too
difficult
for
me
to
keep
in
mind
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
were
under
the
sentence
and
it
could
have
been
held
except
that
the
sentence
granted
immediate
probation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
could
have
done
otherwise
and
was
i
am
sure
done
as
a
part
of
the
process
by
which
they
were
dealt
with
and
then
held
until
the
people
who
introduced
them
into
the
united
states
came
to
trial
which
in
one
case
was
about
six
weeks
later
and
in
another
case
was
about
a
month.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
wouldn’t
be
any
problem
of
--
as
to
this,
except
conceivably
under
the
bail
reform
act.
they
might
have
been
entitled
to
bail
before
trial.
whereas
here
they
were
in
fact
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
after
the
trial
there
would
have
been
no
problem
about
that
at
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that’s
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
same
day
as
executed.
my
interpretation
is
that
it’s
all
part
of
one
process
and
designed
to
deal
appropriately
with
these
people
who
had
broken
the
law
and
to
provide
the
evidence
which
is
necessary
to
appear
against
the
other
persons
who
have
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
there
hadn’t
been
a
suspension
there
would
be
any
problem.
now,
let
me
say
as
i
indicated
in
our
brief
in
our
position
that
i
have
tried
to
do
a
little
good
in
this
matter.
i
have
called
it
to
the
attention
of
the
deputy
attorney
general
and
of
the
attorney
general
and
it
has
proceeded
this
far.
that
on
january
10,
1973,
the
attorney
general
sent
a
letter
addressed
to
the
speaker,
a
corresponding
letter
to
the
vice
president,
but
the
letter
has
not
yet
been
sent
to
this
speaker
or
to
the
vice
president.
the
form
i
have
has
a
big
rubber
stamp
on
it
to
budget
for
clearance
not
sent
to
congress
and
under
the
form,
there
has
to
be
clearance
from
the
office
of
management
and
budget
the
last
paragraph
of
the
letter
says,
“the
office
of
management
and
budget
has
advised
that
enactment
of
this
legislation
is
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
this
administration.”
now,
when
clearance
is
obtained
from
the
office
of
management
and
budget
and
my
influence
is
that
office
is
not
always
very
great,
but
the
attorney
general
has
recommended
it
to
them.
if
it
is
obtained
then
this
proposal
will
be
sent
to
congress.
the
proposal
as
is
indicated
raises
the
$1.00
per
day
in
both
places,
that
is
both
in
section
1821
and
in
the
immigration
provision
to
$20.00
per
day.
it
also
takes
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
make
a
change
in
the
provision
with
respect
to
transportation
cost
for
ordinary
witnesses
where
the
statute
now
provides
that
it
should
be
first
class
and
the
suggestion
is
made
that
in
modern
times
the
economy
class
airfare
is
adequate
and
they
are
doing
that.
however,
i
am
told
that
this
will
be
simply
a
means
of
putting
it
before
congress
if
it
gets
before
congress
and
that
the
department
may
well
not
support
the
full
$20.00
a
day
and
there
is
a
really
real
problem
here
which
needs
to
be
considered.
$20.00
a
day
for
30
days
in
a
month
is
$600.00
a
month
and
in
this
particular
area
of
mexico,
70%
of
the
people
have
an
income
of
less
than
$80.00
a
month.
and
there
is
great
concern
that
if
we
provide
a
build
in
way
to
make
$600.00
a
month
by
illegally
entering
the
united
states
and
being
detained
as
a
witness
that
the
number
of
people
who
do
this
maybe
very
greatly
increased.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
maybe
detained
as
a
visitor?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
a
prisoner,
yes.
but,
if
that
is
works
out
to
be
eight
times
as
much
as
you
can
make
working
in
the
fields
in
mexico,
it
may
look
pretty
good
and
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
if
this
does
come
before
congress
that
representatives
of
the
department
will
recommend
that
there
be
added
a
proviso
to
this
effect.
this
wording
is
not
final,
but
it
explains
the
idea
provided
that
any
alien
who
has
entered
the
country
illegally
and
who
is
held
not
more
than
30
days
as
a
material
witness
in
a
case
involving
the
illegal
entrance
of
himself
or
another
or
any
violation
of
the
immigration
law
shall
receive
only
$5.00
per
day
for
such
period
of
incarceration
when
not
attending
in
court.
and
this
i
mention,
because
it
seems
to
me
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
is
a
problem
which
ought
not
to
be
resolved
in
some
kind
of
rigid
constitutional
terms
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
everybody
be
treated
the
same.
that
it
obviously
has
practical
connotations.
this
is
not
just
a
mechanical
thing,
but
the
protection
of
our
borders
against
the
introduction
of
illegal
immigrants
who
compete
for
jobs
against
american
citizens
in
areas
where
jobs
are
not
readily
available.
it
is
a
legitimate
matter
of
american
policy.
it
is
a
matter
which
can
appropriately
receive
the
attention
and
consideration
of
congress
and
which
seems
to
me
in
a
proper
allocation
of
function
should
be
determined
in
detail
by
the
congress
and
not
by
this
court.
now,
it
is
very
appropriate
i
think
that
the
issue
has
been
raised
and
that
steps
are
being
taken
so
that
it
will
be
put
before
congress
for
active
consideration
there.
i
would
think
that
the
ultimate
resolution
of
the
problem
would
be
better
in
the
hands
of
congress
then
by
any
solution
which
it
seems
to
me
this
court
can
make.
this
court
cannot
spell
out
a
detailed
statute
which
will
say,
“well
in
case
of
illegal
immigrants
and
so
on.”
the
only
analogy
that
has
been
suggested
for
proceeding
by
this
court
is
in
terms
of
some
equal
protection
idea
which
idea
i
think
is
not
relevant
here
in
the
fact
of
this
case.
accordingly,
we
would
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
pleases,
i
would
lodge
this
submission
to
the
budget
bureau
with
the
clerk
so
that
the
clerk
will
have
the
information
available.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
assume
that
it
would
get
--
well,
it
could
be
made
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
could
be
made
retroactive
but
the
proposal
is
simply
prospective
and
whether
anything
will
come
of
this,
i
have
no
idea.
