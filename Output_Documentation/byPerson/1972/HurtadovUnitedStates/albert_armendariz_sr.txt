mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
how
are
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
that
we
are
going
to
consider
today
gentlemen
arises
out
of
a
right
that
the
united
states
government
and
for
that
matter,
state
government
have
in
securing
the
services
of
the
witnesses
in
case
in
which
the
federal
government
and
the
states
are,
this
involves
federal
government
only,
but
in
general,
the
states
are
interested
in
having.
in
other
words,
witnesses
for
the
state,
witnesses
for
the
united
states
government
and
in
the
process
of
securing
these
witnesses
the
congress
has
passed
rule
46
(b)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
authorizes
the
incarceration
of
these
witnesses
during
the
pretrial
procedure
to
guarantee
that
they
will
be
there
and
should
they
not
be
able
to
make
bond
and
that
they
will
be
there
to
testify
during
the
proceedings
involved.
then,
we
have
in
conjunction
with
this,
and
by
the
way,
i
might
say
here
that
there
are
other
ways
that
a
witness
maybe
detained
such
as
an
example
of
the
mafia
or
a
mafia
witness
who
is
--
who
the
federal
government
that
fears
maybe
killed
maybe
detained
in.
so
there
are
other
ways
of
detention
other
than
through
46
(b),
but
then
we
have
an
article
which
is
found
in
the
law
regarding
the
payment
of
these
witnesses
and
this
is
the
statute
which
is
in
question
here.
the
main
issue
here
as
i
see
it
is
the
interpretation
of
1821
regarding
the
payment
of
witnesses.
this
is
the
main
issue
and
the
main
issue
arises
because
of
course
in
the
--
if
it
is
interpreted
in
a
certain
way
then
of
course
the
constitutional
issues
can
be
reached,
but
the
main
issue
arises
because
we
have
a
statute
which
is
in
three
pieces,
it
is
a
tripod,
the
statute
is
in
three
pieces
or
three
sections.
the
first
section
is
that
no
person
shall
be
held
to,
excuse
me,
i
think
i'm
reading
--
the
first
section
involves
the
payment
of
a
per
diem,
a
per
diem
to
all
witnesses.
now,
the
second
section
involves
itself
with
the
payment
of
that
part
of
the
money
that
a
person
or
a
witness
would
spend
in
hotel
and
eating
or
sustenance.
and
then
the
statute
in
its
evolvement
has
a
last
section
which
refers
to
incarcerated
witnesses
and
states
that
such
witnesses
will
receive
$1.00
a
day
compensation.
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
really
the
important
thing
here.
i
think
that
we
have
a
very
similar
case
in
the
way
that
the
court
should
proceed
as
the
dandridge
case
and
that
is
--
that
is
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
of
first
consideration
because
if
the
interpretation
is
--
that
is
$20.00
a
day
then
we
don’t
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
now,
it’s
important
then
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
words
of
the
statute
and
to
look
to
the
rules
of
interpretation
of
statutes
and
this
is
of
course
what
we
feel
has
--
has
not
been
done
by
the
court’s
below.
first,
you
must
look
at
the
fact
that
the
very
first
section
refers
to
a
per
diem,
it
calls
it
a
per
diem.
now,
this
is
of
course
a
daily
payment
and
if
we
look
at
the
statute
itself,
and
we
look
at
the
intention
of
congress
in
all
of
these
things.
we
are
faced
as
lawyers
and
as
judges
with
this
situation.
we
must
recognize
that
congress
in
its
scheme
of
things
has
provided
for
payment,
for
services,
for
all
court
attachés.
it
has
provided
for
payment
to
each
one
of
you
as
judges
of
the
supreme
court.
it
has
provided
for
payment
for
we
lawyers
who
might
be
asked
to
participate
in
the
defense
of
a
person.
congress
has
provided
for
payment
for
the
bailiffs,
for
the
janitor
of
the
court.
and
congress
has
provided
likewise
for
the
payment
of
witnesses,
$20.00
per
day.
now,
must
congress
say
that
in
that
first
section
that
a
per
diem
shall
be
paid
to
witnesses,
including
those
incarcerated.
this
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
think,
but
that’s
not
the
rule
of
interpretation
of
statutes.
now,
look
at
the
second
section
that
we
have
here
gentlemen.
the
second
section
excludes
salaried
employees
of
the
government
from
the
$16.00
payment.
now
there's
rational
there.
the
rational
is
that
salaried
employees
of
the
government
receive
money
from
the
government
to
pay
their
daily
expenses,
their
hotel.
it
excludes
the
witnesses
in
custody.
this
is
reasonable.
it
excludes
them
from
the
$16.00
specifically
because
they
are
having
their
room
and
board
paid
for
by
in
the
local
pool
keep.
it
excludes
witnesses
who
reside
near
the
court.
this
is
also
reasonable
because
if
you
live
near
the
court,
you
go
home
and
you
eat
at
home.
you
don’t
need
pay
a
hotel
bill.
now,
the
second
section
excludes
those
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
it,
means
that
the
first
section
doesn’t.
the
first
section
says,
“all
witnesses.”
now,
we
come
then
to
of
course
the
work
or
the
term
“attending
court”
and
this
is
where
the
fifth
circuit
has
stated
that,
a
witness
in
jail
is
not
attending
court.
they
seem
to
–
they
seem
to
say,
i
mean
they
say,
although
they
--
they
don’t
quote
a
case
to
us
that
this
is
a
stage
of
the
proceeding,
but
we’re
not
dealing
with
semantics
and
words.
we’re
dealing
with
fairness
and
equality
and
we
are
dealing
with
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
of
congress
in
which
we
should
not
attribute
to
congress
such
a
–
such
a
disposition
to
give
to
one
witness
who
is
free,
who
is
in
a
hotel,
enjoying
himself
$20.00
a
day
while
he
waits
and
the
person
who
is
placed
in
jail,
give
him
$1.00
a
day
while
he
waits.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
you’re
referring
to
a
case
which
is
already
decided.
i
believe
we
quoted
in
our
brief
and
the
court
distinguished,
i
forget
which
court
it
was?
but
this
is
been
decided
already.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
and
the
court
distinguished
that
case
as
--
and
i
think
rationally
so
because
this
was
a
person
who
was
arguing
that
his
right
to
work
within
the
penitentiary,
but
this
is
a
prisoner
who
is
being
held
for
another
reason.
he
would
be
held
anyway
and
i
think
--
i
think
the
--
the
government
concedes
that
in
its
original
brief
--
in
opposition
to
this
granting
of
the
writ
where
the
government
concedes
that
there
is
very
limited
reason
to
differentiate
between
these
people
when
they’re
being
held
for
no
other
reason
than
to
testify
and
this
i
submit
is
the
situation
here.
in
the
other
case,
they
are
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
is
not
in
the
record.
the
--
we
contend
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
our
position
is
that
they
were
not
paid
in
any
case
that
we
have
found,
but
this
is
not
in
the
record
because
this
case
came
up
for
some
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no
sir.
our
position
of
course
would
be
in
line
with
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
they
should
get
a
payment
of
$20.00
for
the
day
of
the
trial,
at
least
for
the
day
of
the
trial
whether
they
testify
or
not,
but
it’s
very
interesting
to
note
and
we
ask
or
we
sent
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
he
is
treated
differently
in
a
very,
very
substantial
way
and
that
is
that
in
a
witness
that
the
example
that
was
put
it
by
one
of
the
other
justices.
you
are
--
let's
say
he
is
not
in
prison,
alright.
you’re
subpoenaed
from
here
to
el
paso,
texas.
you’re
going
to
testify
before
the
western
district
of
texas.
you
get
$20.00
a
day
from
the
minute
you
leave
here
whether
you
testify
or
not.
now,
you
go
to
el
paso,
you
take
two
days
if
you
drive,
you
fly.
now,
let’s
suppose
the
case
is
set
for
monday
morning
which
is
the
case
in
most
of
our
courts
and
he
gets
there
and
he
reports
to
the
district
attorney.
and
the
district
attorney
tells
him,
“well,
we’ve
got
six
cases
ahead
of
you.
we
won’t
need
you
till
thursday.
go
down
where
are
you?”
“well,
i'm
at
motel
so
and
so.”
“well,
you
stay
there
and
stick
around
and
we’ll
call
you
when
we
need
you.”
he
gets
$20.00
a
day
while
waiting
in
the
hotel
while
the
man
who
is
waiting
in
the
jail
gets
$1.00.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
well,
so
he
is
the
man
in
jail
here,
your
honor.
i
submit
to
you
that
he
is
very
much
so.
how
much
more
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
i
submit
to
your
honor,
yes
sir.
that
when
the
minute
that
a
complaint
is
filed
against
the
person
and
that
man
is
put
in
under
46
(b),
there
is
a
trial
stage
or
there
is
a
trial
going
on
and
it’s
the
same
stage
because
you
are
in
that
stage
of
the
game
and
i
submit
to
you,
yes
sir?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor,
we
have
a
--
in
our
whole
position,
we
have
evaded
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process
in
the
holding.
we
have
limited
our
position
to
the
fact
that
given
the
right
to
hold
and
it
is
only
in
the
matters
presented
by
the
defendant,
i
beg
your
pardon,
by
the
government
that
we
have
reached
this
particular
point
and
of
course
we
would
go
into
it
a
little
bit
more
in
rebuttal,
and
intend
to.
but
specifically,
what
you
have
here
of
course
is
an
interpretation
of
attending
in
court.
now,
i
agree
with
you
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
one
of
the
issues
here,
but
i
fail
to
see
how
interpretation
of
statutes
and
logic
or
anything
else
can
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
a
person
that
is
in
jail
because
a
case
has
been
initiated
and
it
is
in
progress
is
not
attending
in
court
simply
because
he
is
in
jail
waiting
for
his
honor
to
call
the
case.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor
with
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
there
would
no
reason
to
hold
them
other
than
as
witnesses
at
this
time.
it
would
have
been
gone.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
downstairs
in
its
decision
stated
what
we
contended
at
the
time
that
this
is
a
recognition
by
congress
that
a
man
in
jail.
now
mind
you,
look
at
the
whole
statute
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
it
applies
to
those
persons
who
are
in
custody,
who
are
in
jail,
in
order
to
provide
toiletries
and
things
that
they
need
while
they
are
in
jail
because
notice
that
the
other
witness
who
is
free
gets
$16.00.
ask
yourselves
there,
why
16,
why
not
15?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
it’s
an
addendum.
it’s
an
addition.
it
calls
something
else.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
applicable
to
persons
in
jail.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
$21.00,
yes
sir.
because
$20.00
is
the
per
diem
and
$1.00
is
for
toiletries
and
other
things
that
a
man
needs
in
jail
and
i
suggest
that
the
statutes
suggest
also
that
the
payment
be
made
on
a
daily
basis
so
that
they
can
have
those
--
and
it
uses
the
word
per
day.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
and
it's
reasonable.
this
is
logical
that
it
is
relating
to
a
man
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir
and
then
outside
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
$21.00
yes,
sir.
the
$15.00
is
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
this
is
what
this
is
all
about,
yes
sir.
and
i
want
to
reserve
whatever
left
or
time
i
have
for
rebuttal
in
court.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
if
court
please
if
i
may
respond.
gentlemen,
we
have
listened
--
first
let
me
tell
you
that
up
to
the
--
in
the
lower
court
as
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
the
government
did
not
argue
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
this
invidious
discrimination
that
exists
in
this
statute.
the
government
has
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
what,
sir?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
i
recognize
that
but
i
think
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
invidious
and
i
think
that
--
the
point
to
that
i'm
making
is
that
they
resorted
to
201
which
is
something
all
of
this
argument
that
counsel
has
made
is
subject
to
a
motion
to
strike
because
they
have
added
to
this
record
in
a
rule
that
doesn’t
come
into
effect
till
july
1,
1973.
and
they
have
--
we
had
submitted
a
stipulation
as
to
the
appendix
and
now,
he
has
added
an
appendix
under
this
rule
which
isn’t
a
rule
yet.
but
the
real
reason
for
it
is
because
up
to
now
they
had
advanced
no
reason,
your
honor,
regarding
the
rationale
under
which
this
statute
might
stand
constitutionally.
now,
they
say
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
they
have
added
all
of
these
business
about
the
--
that
they
were
in
--
that
they
were
charged,
that
they
had
six
months
given
to
them,
that
they
were
granted
voluntary
departure.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes
sir,
they
have
added,
on
page
31
of,
excuse
me
let
me
find
it
in
--
on
page
--
they
make
a
statement
in
their
brief
and
i’ll
find
it
in
a
minute.
although,
we
don’t
--
here!
here
it
is.
it
is
on
page
5.
“although,
we
did
not
suggest
that
additional
facts
are
in
anyway
necessary
to
the
resolution
of
the
case
at
this
stage,
we
believe
the
court
may
find
in
pertinence
so
on
and
so
forth
under
rule
201
(b)
(2)
of
the
new
federal
rules
of
evidence.”
then
they
add
all
of
the
argument
of
counsel
regarding
what
actually
happened
in
this
case
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no,
sir.
not
until
july
1
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no,
the
point
that
i'm
making
your
honor
is
so
that
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
well,
they
do
because
they
have
added
a
--
the
whole
addendum
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
precisely.
they
have
added
--
and
to
evade
the
fact
that
here
we
are
talking
about
witnesses
who
are
in
jail.
they
would
like
isolate
this
into
a
class.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor,
in
the
--
in
this
dandridge
case,
this
court
established
clearly
the
right
of
this
court
to
establish
judicial,
through
judicial
notice.
those
things
are
in
that
case
it
was
that
women
act
more
as
--
but
this
is
a
--
these
are
specific
facts
about
specific
people
that
have
to
be
placed.
i
knew
nothing
about
this
until
i
received
this.
but
the
point
that
i'm
really
making
is
that
this
is
trying
to
sustain
on
a
rationale
basis
on
irrational
generalizations
which
are
present
in
every
case
of
invidious
discrimination.
it’s
a
wonder
that
they
don’t
argue
that
you
should
let
us
all
say
because
they're
brown,
because
they
have
long
hair,
because
--
but
the
argument
is
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
precisely.
it
is,
and
this
is
when
we
say
that
it
is
irrational
because
they
are
--
these
are
only
generalizations.
they
haven’t
now
--
now,
they
say
there
is
another
statute.
now,
that
other
statute,
notice
the
words
it’s
another
per
diem
because
they
are
being
held
in
another
agency
to
give
authority
to
the
other
agency
to
give
them
that
dollar
a
day
that
they
need
for
their
--
now,
they
come
in
and
admit
their
going
to
go
to
congress,
“give
us
$20.00
or
give
us
$5.00”
in
the
case
of
this
type
of
alien.
now,
notice
your
honor
that
there
is
a
limitation
there.
i
suggest
your
honor
in
the
added
material
we
find
for
instance
that
the
government
has
fined
the
principles.
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
here.
one
of
them
was
fine
$1,500.00,
the
other
$1,500.00,
another
$300.00
which
fully
covers
the
cost
of
this.
that
congress
had
this
in
mind
and
that
there
are
other
solutions
other
than
--
that
this
is
not
rational,
there
is
no
rationale.
the
classification
statute
applies
to
all
witnesses
detained,
all
witnesses
alike.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
if
it’s
a
--
your
honor,
the
statute
title
8,
1325
and
1326
categorized
these
things
as
felonies
and
misdemeanors
which
is
that
the
discretion
of
the
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
$500.00
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
and
six
months
in
jail.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no.
no,
wait
a
minute.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
people
who
had
them
that
transport
them.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
$500.00
and
six
months
in
jail
is
the
maximum
for
each
offense.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
it
would
seem
to
me
sir
that
that
might
be
one
of
the
solutions
to
the
problem,
yes?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no,
sir.
this
doesn’t
necessary
follow
because
you
also
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
this
is
what
we
haven’t
considered.
what
is
the
purpose
of
1821?
the
purpose
of
1821
is
to
make
payment
to
witnesses
to
see
that
they
don’t
loose
out
of
their
own
pocket.
the
government
admits
that
in
their
brief.
they
have
a
statement
that
it
is
not
reasonable
for
--
it
is
on
page
21,
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
and
require
witnesses
to
attend
court
at
a
personal
financial
loss.
now,
either
their
witnesses
or
their
defendants
because
if
they
have
--
if
their
defendants
then
they
have
to
be
provided
counsel.
they
may
not
want
to
testify
and
the
whole
case
may
fall.
this
is
a
convenience
of
the
government,
your
honor.
this
is
something
that
the
government
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
the
word
judgment
of
guilty
and
the
whole
legal
process,
administrative
and
criminal
had
terminated.
they
have
been
granted
voluntary
departure.
they
could
leave
for
mexico
immediately.
they
didn’t
have
to
be
witnesses.
they
had
been
given
a
suspended
sentence.
they
could
leave
from
mexico.
they
were
held
here
at
the
convenience
of
the
government
and
the
government
received
$1,500.00
from
one
$1,500.00
from
the
other
$300.00
and
got
convictions
because
of
this.
the
government,
i
submit
to
your
honor
either
has
witnesses
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
reason
they’ve
gone
to
congress.
they
realize
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
they're
going
to
have
to
change
it.
they're
going
to
have
to
do
something
because
it
is
unconstitutional
as
it
is
and
they've
gone
to
congress
because
it
is
unconstitutional
and
they
have
recognized
that
their
might
be
some
differences,
but
the
statute
itself
at
this
time
is
invidious.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
well,
two
of
them
where
held
almost
90
days
sir,
but
we
have
some
that
were
held
six
months,
some
of
them
nine
months,
they
put
them
in
jail
and
threw
away
the
keys.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
sir?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
two
of
the
named
petitioners
were
there
almost
90
days,
justice
marshall.
and
they
threw
away
the
key
now.
they
could
have
taken
their
deposition.
they
could
have
done
several
things
but
if
you
have
to
pay
him
a
dollar
a
day,
therefore
a
reason
to
do
that.
just
keep
them
it
is
cheaper.
it
is
cheaper!
it
is
cheaper
to
pay
him
a
dollar
a
day
than
to
take
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no,
for
the
time
after
the
conviction.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
that’s
all
we’re
asking
for.
yes,
sir.
only
when
they
were
detained
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
well,
that’s
what
we
meant.
if
your
honor
will
see
that’s
what
we
meant.
yes,
sir
and
i
think
that
we
are
off
base
if
we
look
at
this
thing
in
the
alien
only
because
46
(b)
is
for
all
witnesses
and
all
witnesses
who
are
detained
and
the
--
this
is
the
whole
matter
as
it
stands.
i
think
your
honors
we
have
an
unconstitutional
statute.
i
notice
the
white
light,
i
wanted
to
take
one
minute
to
thank
your
honors
for
allowing
me
to
sit
my
son
who
is
my
partner
and
who
helped
me
to
--
who
is
not
a
member
of
this
bar
for
permission
that
you
gave
me
for
the
attention
that
you
gave
me,
i
sincerely
appreciate
it.
i
would
like
to
call
just
one
case
more
in
graham
v.
richardson,
you
dealt
with
this
issue
of
differentiation
in
the
cause
of
alienate,
and
i
suggest
that
that
case
is
in
point
here.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
how
are
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
that
we
are
going
to
consider
today
gentlemen
arises
out
of
a
right
that
the
united
states
government
and
for
that
matter,
state
government
have
in
securing
the
services
of
the
witnesses
in
case
in
which
the
federal
government
and
the
states
are,
this
involves
federal
government
only,
but
in
general,
the
states
are
interested
in
having.
in
other
words,
witnesses
for
the
state,
witnesses
for
the
united
states
government
and
in
the
process
of
securing
these
witnesses
the
congress
has
passed
rule
46
(b)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
authorizes
the
incarceration
of
these
witnesses
during
the
pretrial
procedure
to
guarantee
that
they
will
be
there
and
should
they
not
be
able
to
make
bond
and
that
they
will
be
there
to
testify
during
the
proceedings
involved.
then,
we
have
in
conjunction
with
this,
and
by
the
way,
i
might
say
here
that
there
are
other
ways
that
a
witness
maybe
detained
such
as
an
example
of
the
mafia
or
a
mafia
witness
who
is
--
who
the
federal
government
that
fears
maybe
killed
maybe
detained
in.
so
there
are
other
ways
of
detention
other
than
through
46
(b),
but
then
we
have
an
article
which
is
found
in
the
law
regarding
the
payment
of
these
witnesses
and
this
is
the
statute
which
is
in
question
here.
the
main
issue
here
as
i
see
it
is
the
interpretation
of
1821
regarding
the
payment
of
witnesses.
this
is
the
main
issue
and
the
main
issue
arises
because
of
course
in
the
--
if
it
is
interpreted
in
a
certain
way
then
of
course
the
constitutional
issues
can
be
reached,
but
the
main
issue
arises
because
we
have
a
statute
which
is
in
three
pieces,
it
is
a
tripod,
the
statute
is
in
three
pieces
or
three
sections.
the
first
section
is
that
no
person
shall
be
held
to,
excuse
me,
i
think
i'm
reading
--
the
first
section
involves
the
payment
of
a
per
diem,
a
per
diem
to
all
witnesses.
now,
the
second
section
involves
itself
with
the
payment
of
that
part
of
the
money
that
a
person
or
a
witness
would
spend
in
hotel
and
eating
or
sustenance.
and
then
the
statute
in
its
evolvement
has
a
last
section
which
refers
to
incarcerated
witnesses
and
states
that
such
witnesses
will
receive
$1.00
a
day
compensation.
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
really
the
important
thing
here.
i
think
that
we
have
a
very
similar
case
in
the
way
that
the
court
should
proceed
as
the
dandridge
case
and
that
is
--
that
is
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
of
first
consideration
because
if
the
interpretation
is
--
that
is
$20.00
a
day
then
we
don’t
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
now,
it’s
important
then
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
words
of
the
statute
and
to
look
to
the
rules
of
interpretation
of
statutes
and
this
is
of
course
what
we
feel
has
--
has
not
been
done
by
the
court’s
below.
first,
you
must
look
at
the
fact
that
the
very
first
section
refers
to
a
per
diem,
it
calls
it
a
per
diem.
now,
this
is
of
course
a
daily
payment
and
if
we
look
at
the
statute
itself,
and
we
look
at
the
intention
of
congress
in
all
of
these
things.
we
are
faced
as
lawyers
and
as
judges
with
this
situation.
we
must
recognize
that
congress
in
its
scheme
of
things
has
provided
for
payment,
for
services,
for
all
court
attachés.
it
has
provided
for
payment
to
each
one
of
you
as
judges
of
the
supreme
court.
it
has
provided
for
payment
for
we
lawyers
who
might
be
asked
to
participate
in
the
defense
of
a
person.
congress
has
provided
for
payment
for
the
bailiffs,
for
the
janitor
of
the
court.
and
congress
has
provided
likewise
for
the
payment
of
witnesses,
$20.00
per
day.
now,
must
congress
say
that
in
that
first
section
that
a
per
diem
shall
be
paid
to
witnesses,
including
those
incarcerated.
this
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
think,
but
that’s
not
the
rule
of
interpretation
of
statutes.
now,
look
at
the
second
section
that
we
have
here
gentlemen.
the
second
section
excludes
salaried
employees
of
the
government
from
the
$16.00
payment.
now
there's
rational
there.
the
rational
is
that
salaried
employees
of
the
government
receive
money
from
the
government
to
pay
their
daily
expenses,
their
hotel.
it
excludes
the
witnesses
in
custody.
this
is
reasonable.
it
excludes
them
from
the
$16.00
specifically
because
they
are
having
their
room
and
board
paid
for
by
in
the
local
pool
keep.
it
excludes
witnesses
who
reside
near
the
court.
this
is
also
reasonable
because
if
you
live
near
the
court,
you
go
home
and
you
eat
at
home.
you
don’t
need
pay
a
hotel
bill.
now,
the
second
section
excludes
those
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
it,
means
that
the
first
section
doesn’t.
the
first
section
says,
“all
witnesses.”
now,
we
come
then
to
of
course
the
work
or
the
term
“attending
court”
and
this
is
where
the
fifth
circuit
has
stated
that,
a
witness
in
jail
is
not
attending
court.
they
seem
to
–
they
seem
to
say,
i
mean
they
say,
although
they
--
they
don’t
quote
a
case
to
us
that
this
is
a
stage
of
the
proceeding,
but
we’re
not
dealing
with
semantics
and
words.
we’re
dealing
with
fairness
and
equality
and
we
are
dealing
with
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
of
congress
in
which
we
should
not
attribute
to
congress
such
a
–
such
a
disposition
to
give
to
one
witness
who
is
free,
who
is
in
a
hotel,
enjoying
himself
$20.00
a
day
while
he
waits
and
the
person
who
is
placed
in
jail,
give
him
$1.00
a
day
while
he
waits.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
you’re
referring
to
a
case
which
is
already
decided.
i
believe
we
quoted
in
our
brief
and
the
court
distinguished,
i
forget
which
court
it
was?
but
this
is
been
decided
already.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
and
the
court
distinguished
that
case
as
--
and
i
think
rationally
so
because
this
was
a
person
who
was
arguing
that
his
right
to
work
within
the
penitentiary,
but
this
is
a
prisoner
who
is
being
held
for
another
reason.
he
would
be
held
anyway
and
i
think
--
i
think
the
--
the
government
concedes
that
in
its
original
brief
--
in
opposition
to
this
granting
of
the
writ
where
the
government
concedes
that
there
is
very
limited
reason
to
differentiate
between
these
people
when
they’re
being
held
for
no
other
reason
than
to
testify
and
this
i
submit
is
the
situation
here.
in
the
other
case,
they
are
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
is
not
in
the
record.
the
--
we
contend
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
our
position
is
that
they
were
not
paid
in
any
case
that
we
have
found,
but
this
is
not
in
the
record
because
this
case
came
up
for
some
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no
sir.
our
position
of
course
would
be
in
line
with
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
they
should
get
a
payment
of
$20.00
for
the
day
of
the
trial,
at
least
for
the
day
of
the
trial
whether
they
testify
or
not,
but
it’s
very
interesting
to
note
and
we
ask
or
we
sent
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
he
is
treated
differently
in
a
very,
very
substantial
way
and
that
is
that
in
a
witness
that
the
example
that
was
put
it
by
one
of
the
other
justices.
you
are
--
let's
say
he
is
not
in
prison,
alright.
you’re
subpoenaed
from
here
to
el
paso,
texas.
you’re
going
to
testify
before
the
western
district
of
texas.
you
get
$20.00
a
day
from
the
minute
you
leave
here
whether
you
testify
or
not.
now,
you
go
to
el
paso,
you
take
two
days
if
you
drive,
you
fly.
now,
let’s
suppose
the
case
is
set
for
monday
morning
which
is
the
case
in
most
of
our
courts
and
he
gets
there
and
he
reports
to
the
district
attorney.
and
the
district
attorney
tells
him,
“well,
we’ve
got
six
cases
ahead
of
you.
we
won’t
need
you
till
thursday.
go
down
where
are
you?”
“well,
i'm
at
motel
so
and
so.”
“well,
you
stay
there
and
stick
around
and
we’ll
call
you
when
we
need
you.”
he
gets
$20.00
a
day
while
waiting
in
the
hotel
while
the
man
who
is
waiting
in
the
jail
gets
$1.00.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
well,
so
he
is
the
man
in
jail
here,
your
honor.
i
submit
to
you
that
he
is
very
much
so.
how
much
more
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
i
submit
to
your
honor,
yes
sir.
that
when
the
minute
that
a
complaint
is
filed
against
the
person
and
that
man
is
put
in
under
46
(b),
there
is
a
trial
stage
or
there
is
a
trial
going
on
and
it’s
the
same
stage
because
you
are
in
that
stage
of
the
game
and
i
submit
to
you,
yes
sir?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor,
we
have
a
--
in
our
whole
position,
we
have
evaded
the
issue
of
procedural
due
process
in
the
holding.
we
have
limited
our
position
to
the
fact
that
given
the
right
to
hold
and
it
is
only
in
the
matters
presented
by
the
defendant,
i
beg
your
pardon,
by
the
government
that
we
have
reached
this
particular
point
and
of
course
we
would
go
into
it
a
little
bit
more
in
rebuttal,
and
intend
to.
but
specifically,
what
you
have
here
of
course
is
an
interpretation
of
attending
in
court.
now,
i
agree
with
you
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
one
of
the
issues
here,
but
i
fail
to
see
how
interpretation
of
statutes
and
logic
or
anything
else
can
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
a
person
that
is
in
jail
because
a
case
has
been
initiated
and
it
is
in
progress
is
not
attending
in
court
simply
because
he
is
in
jail
waiting
for
his
honor
to
call
the
case.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor
with
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
there
would
no
reason
to
hold
them
other
than
as
witnesses
at
this
time.
it
would
have
been
gone.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
downstairs
in
its
decision
stated
what
we
contended
at
the
time
that
this
is
a
recognition
by
congress
that
a
man
in
jail.
now
mind
you,
look
at
the
whole
statute
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
it
applies
to
those
persons
who
are
in
custody,
who
are
in
jail,
in
order
to
provide
toiletries
and
things
that
they
need
while
they
are
in
jail
because
notice
that
the
other
witness
who
is
free
gets
$16.00.
ask
yourselves
there,
why
16,
why
not
15?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
it’s
an
addendum.
it’s
an
addition.
it
calls
something
else.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
applicable
to
persons
in
jail.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
$21.00,
yes
sir.
because
$20.00
is
the
per
diem
and
$1.00
is
for
toiletries
and
other
things
that
a
man
needs
in
jail
and
i
suggest
that
the
statutes
suggest
also
that
the
payment
be
made
on
a
daily
basis
so
that
they
can
have
those
--
and
it
uses
the
word
per
day.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
and
it's
reasonable.
this
is
logical
that
it
is
relating
to
a
man
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir
and
then
outside
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
$21.00
yes,
sir.
the
$15.00
is
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
this
is
what
this
is
all
about,
yes
sir.
and
i
want
to
reserve
whatever
left
or
time
i
have
for
rebuttal
in
court.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
if
court
please
if
i
may
respond.
gentlemen,
we
have
listened
--
first
let
me
tell
you
that
up
to
the
--
in
the
lower
court
as
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
the
government
did
not
argue
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
this
invidious
discrimination
that
exists
in
this
statute.
the
government
has
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
what,
sir?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
i
recognize
that
but
i
think
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
invidious
and
i
think
that
--
the
point
to
that
i'm
making
is
that
they
resorted
to
201
which
is
something
all
of
this
argument
that
counsel
has
made
is
subject
to
a
motion
to
strike
because
they
have
added
to
this
record
in
a
rule
that
doesn’t
come
into
effect
till
july
1,
1973.
and
they
have
--
we
had
submitted
a
stipulation
as
to
the
appendix
and
now,
he
has
added
an
appendix
under
this
rule
which
isn’t
a
rule
yet.
but
the
real
reason
for
it
is
because
up
to
now
they
had
advanced
no
reason,
your
honor,
regarding
the
rationale
under
which
this
statute
might
stand
constitutionally.
now,
they
say
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
they
have
added
all
of
these
business
about
the
--
that
they
were
in
--
that
they
were
charged,
that
they
had
six
months
given
to
them,
that
they
were
granted
voluntary
departure.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes
sir,
they
have
added,
on
page
31
of,
excuse
me
let
me
find
it
in
--
on
page
--
they
make
a
statement
in
their
brief
and
i’ll
find
it
in
a
minute.
although,
we
don’t
--
here!
here
it
is.
it
is
on
page
5.
“although,
we
did
not
suggest
that
additional
facts
are
in
anyway
necessary
to
the
resolution
of
the
case
at
this
stage,
we
believe
the
court
may
find
in
pertinence
so
on
and
so
forth
under
rule
201
(b)
(2)
of
the
new
federal
rules
of
evidence.”
then
they
add
all
of
the
argument
of
counsel
regarding
what
actually
happened
in
this
case
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no,
sir.
not
until
july
1
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no,
the
point
that
i'm
making
your
honor
is
so
that
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
well,
they
do
because
they
have
added
a
--
the
whole
addendum
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
precisely.
they
have
added
--
and
to
evade
the
fact
that
here
we
are
talking
about
witnesses
who
are
in
jail.
they
would
like
isolate
this
into
a
class.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
your
honor,
in
the
--
in
this
dandridge
case,
this
court
established
clearly
the
right
of
this
court
to
establish
judicial,
through
judicial
notice.
those
things
are
in
that
case
it
was
that
women
act
more
as
--
but
this
is
a
--
these
are
specific
facts
about
specific
people
that
have
to
be
placed.
i
knew
nothing
about
this
until
i
received
this.
but
the
point
that
i'm
really
making
is
that
this
is
trying
to
sustain
on
a
rationale
basis
on
irrational
generalizations
which
are
present
in
every
case
of
invidious
discrimination.
it’s
a
wonder
that
they
don’t
argue
that
you
should
let
us
all
say
because
they're
brown,
because
they
have
long
hair,
because
--
but
the
argument
is
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
precisely.
it
is,
and
this
is
when
we
say
that
it
is
irrational
because
they
are
--
these
are
only
generalizations.
they
haven’t
now
--
now,
they
say
there
is
another
statute.
now,
that
other
statute,
notice
the
words
it’s
another
per
diem
because
they
are
being
held
in
another
agency
to
give
authority
to
the
other
agency
to
give
them
that
dollar
a
day
that
they
need
for
their
--
now,
they
come
in
and
admit
their
going
to
go
to
congress,
“give
us
$20.00
or
give
us
$5.00”
in
the
case
of
this
type
of
alien.
now,
notice
your
honor
that
there
is
a
limitation
there.
i
suggest
your
honor
in
the
added
material
we
find
for
instance
that
the
government
has
fined
the
principles.
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
here.
one
of
them
was
fine
$1,500.00,
the
other
$1,500.00,
another
$300.00
which
fully
covers
the
cost
of
this.
that
congress
had
this
in
mind
and
that
there
are
other
solutions
other
than
--
that
this
is
not
rational,
there
is
no
rationale.
the
classification
statute
applies
to
all
witnesses
detained,
all
witnesses
alike.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
if
it’s
a
--
your
honor,
the
statute
title
8,
1325
and
1326
categorized
these
things
as
felonies
and
misdemeanors
which
is
that
the
discretion
of
the
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
$500.00
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
and
six
months
in
jail.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no.
no,
wait
a
minute.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
people
who
had
them
that
transport
them.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
$500.00
and
six
months
in
jail
is
the
maximum
for
each
offense.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
it
would
seem
to
me
sir
that
that
might
be
one
of
the
solutions
to
the
problem,
yes?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no,
sir.
this
doesn’t
necessary
follow
because
you
also
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
this
is
what
we
haven’t
considered.
what
is
the
purpose
of
1821?
the
purpose
of
1821
is
to
make
payment
to
witnesses
to
see
that
they
don’t
loose
out
of
their
own
pocket.
the
government
admits
that
in
their
brief.
they
have
a
statement
that
it
is
not
reasonable
for
--
it
is
on
page
21,
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
and
require
witnesses
to
attend
court
at
a
personal
financial
loss.
now,
either
their
witnesses
or
their
defendants
because
if
they
have
--
if
their
defendants
then
they
have
to
be
provided
counsel.
they
may
not
want
to
testify
and
the
whole
case
may
fall.
this
is
a
convenience
of
the
government,
your
honor.
this
is
something
that
the
government
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
the
word
judgment
of
guilty
and
the
whole
legal
process,
administrative
and
criminal
had
terminated.
they
have
been
granted
voluntary
departure.
they
could
leave
for
mexico
immediately.
they
didn’t
have
to
be
witnesses.
they
had
been
given
a
suspended
sentence.
they
could
leave
from
mexico.
they
were
held
here
at
the
convenience
of
the
government
and
the
government
received
$1,500.00
from
one
$1,500.00
from
the
other
$300.00
and
got
convictions
because
of
this.
the
government,
i
submit
to
your
honor
either
has
witnesses
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
reason
they’ve
gone
to
congress.
they
realize
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
they're
going
to
have
to
change
it.
they're
going
to
have
to
do
something
because
it
is
unconstitutional
as
it
is
and
they've
gone
to
congress
because
it
is
unconstitutional
and
they
have
recognized
that
their
might
be
some
differences,
but
the
statute
itself
at
this
time
is
invidious.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
well,
two
of
them
where
held
almost
90
days
sir,
but
we
have
some
that
were
held
six
months,
some
of
them
nine
months,
they
put
them
in
jail
and
threw
away
the
keys.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
sir?
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
two
of
the
named
petitioners
were
there
almost
90
days,
justice
marshall.
and
they
threw
away
the
key
now.
they
could
have
taken
their
deposition.
they
could
have
done
several
things
but
if
you
have
to
pay
him
a
dollar
a
day,
therefore
a
reason
to
do
that.
just
keep
them
it
is
cheaper.
it
is
cheaper!
it
is
cheaper
to
pay
him
a
dollar
a
day
than
to
take
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
no,
for
the
time
after
the
conviction.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
that’s
all
we’re
asking
for.
yes,
sir.
only
when
they
were
detained
--
mr.
albert
armendariz,
sr.
well,
that’s
what
we
meant.
if
your
honor
will
see
that’s
what
we
meant.
yes,
sir
and
i
think
that
we
are
off
base
if
we
look
at
this
thing
in
the
alien
only
because
46
(b)
is
for
all
witnesses
and
all
witnesses
who
are
detained
and
the
--
this
is
the
whole
matter
as
it
stands.
i
think
your
honors
we
have
an
unconstitutional
statute.
i
notice
the
white
light,
i
wanted
to
take
one
minute
to
thank
your
honors
for
allowing
me
to
sit
my
son
who
is
my
partner
and
who
helped
me
to
--
who
is
not
a
member
of
this
bar
for
permission
that
you
gave
me
for
the
attention
that
you
gave
me,
i
sincerely
appreciate
it.
i
would
like
to
call
just
one
case
more
in
graham
v.
richardson,
you
dealt
with
this
issue
of
differentiation
in
the
cause
of
alienate,
and
i
suggest
that
that
case
is
in
point
here.
thank
you
gentlemen.
