j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
armendariz.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you’re
going
--
if
we
should
agree
with
you
that
the
$20.00
per
day
applies
as
well
to
the
man
in
jail.
what
do
you
do
then
with
the
last
sentence?
to
what
does
that
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
now,
my
question
is
to
whom,
to
what
witness
that
this
last
sentence
apply
if
would
agree
with
you
that
your
man
was
entitled
to
$20.00
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
afraid
i
haven’t
made
myself
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
agree
with
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
your
man
was
entitled
to
$20.00
a
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
anyone
in
the
position
of
your
client
is
entitled
to
$20.00
a
day
and
read
the
statute
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
we
do
with
the
last
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
applicable
to
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
man
outside
unless
he
is
in
government
service,
he
really
gets
$36.00
a
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
since
your
man
is
in
prison,
he
at
least
gets
$21.00?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
what
this
is
all
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
of
course
they
expressly
allege
that
each
claim
is
based
on
an
act
of
congress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
proceed
mr.
solicitor
general.
but
his
alternative
is
if
you
don’t
construe
it
that
way
then
it’s
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
outside
the
party?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
what
i
want
to
ask
you.
does
in
the
tucker
act
permit
a
claim
founded
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
purpose
of
my
question
at
this
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
probably
of
that
because
it
was
on
march
26th,
when
apparently
they
pleaded
guilty
to
the
misdemeanor
which
was
although
six
months
imprisonment
and
then
suspended
and
supervised
probation
for
one
year,
and
that
same
day,
they
were
committed
as
material
witnesses.
so,
it
must
happen
almost
simultaneously
i
gather
mr.
solicitor
general.
i'm
reading
from
what
you
say
page
7,
and
8.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
--
you
said
page
seven
that
was
on
the
26th
of
they
pleaded,
these
petitioners
pleaded
guilty
and
got
a
six
months
execution
which
was
suspended
that
they
were
put
on
probation
for
one
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
on
next
page
it
says
on
that
day
they
were
committed
as
material
witness
on
the
same
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
you
know
this
is
quite
right
if
it
haven’t
been
that
suspension
the
right
of
having
a
sentence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
you
say
the
government
has
added?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
just
a
reference
c,
i
don’t
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
recite
that
is
expressing
the
prevailing
practice
as
i
read?
they
don’t
rely
on
that
new
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
i
will
don’t
waste
your
time.
