mr.
robert
v.
bullock
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
as
has
been
stated
that's
before
the
court
is
in
the
absence
of
a
prior
adversary
hearing
is
the
seizure
incident
to
arrest
of
allegedly
obscene
material,
a
violation
of
due
process.
my
answer
of
course,
is
no.
let
me
go
into
if
i
may
a
few
the
facts
that
may
not
have
been
fully
brought
out
before.
on
september
28,
1970,
the
deputy
sheriff
of
pulaski
county
observed
approximately
30
minutes
of
the
film
"cindy
and
donna"
from
advantage
point
outside
of
the
theater
at
a
road
nearby.
thereafter
he
reported
to
a
superior,
the
sheriff
of
pulaski
county.
the
next
evening
as
was
noted,
on
september
29th,
1970,
the
sheriff
accompanied,
in
this
case
by
the
commonwealth
attorney,
who
is
the
chief
prosecuting
officer
for
that
district,
paid
admission
for
entrance
into
the
theater
for
showing
of
the
film.
after
viewing
of
the
entire
film,
the
entire
film,
the
sheriff
proceeded
to
the
projection
booth
and
arrested
the
petitioner,
mr.
roaden,
who
was
at
that
time
changing
the
carton.
i
believe
it
was
on
the
projection
theater
was
upside
down.
the
sheriff
seized
the
film
incident
to
the
lawful
arrest.
the
following
day
on
september
30th,
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
who
returned
the
indictment,
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
case
was
had
and
a
verdict
was
entered
october
21st,
1970.
now
there
are
certain
facts
in
this
case
they
are
somewhat
peculiar.
we
take
issue
with
my
brother
wicker,
concerning
whether
the
film's
obscenity
has
been
acknowledged.
petitioner
obviously
acknowledged
the
obscenity
of
the
film
as
was
earlier
noted
and
during
the
course
of
appeal
through
the
courts,
he
is
not
seriously
contended
otherwise.
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall
in
our
opinion
the
film
was
obscene
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
also
moved
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
when
is
it
or
has
it
been?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
it
is
in
the
custody
of
the
court
of
appeals,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
until
this
day,
yes
sir
of
kentucky.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no
sir,
because
even
to
this
day
and
this
was
my
next
point,
petitioner
has
not
moved
for
the
return
of
the
film,
his
moved
for
the
film
which
was
admittedly
obscene
to
be
suppressed
in
evidence
but
he
has
not
moved
for
a
return
of
this
film
so
he
might
later
show
it.
copies
of
cindy
and
donna.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
sir,
that
is
correct,
for
use
it
is
evidence.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
would
say
that
the
burden
would
be
upon
petitioner
to
move
for
its
return.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no
sir.
extreme
caution
we
maintain
was
used
to
safeguard
against
infringement
of
petitioner's
constitution
right.
the
chief
prosecutor
for
the
district
accompanied
the
sheriff
in
this
case.
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
seizure
and
presumably
he
would
have
the
opportunity
to
advice
the
sheriff
on
the
probable
cause.
as
i
noted
the
grand
jury
the
next
day
affirmed,
and
confirmed
the
fact
that
there
was
probable
cause
and
they
returned
an
indictment
and
in
this
case
i
mean
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
trial
of
the
case
was
completed
some
22
days
after
the
original
arrest
and
seizure.
there
was
a
determination
within
that
period
of
time.
we
maintain
that
the
seizure
of
the
film
was
incidental
to
lawful
arrest
for
crime
which
was
committed
in
the
officer's
presence.
and
that
the
reason
for
the
seizure
of
this
film
was
for
as
used
as
best
evidence
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
not
for
the
purposes
of
suppressing
ideas
or
first
amendment
rights.
as
noted
by
our
kentucky
court
of
appeals
this
is
the
way
we
are
differentiating.
we
have
differentiated
the
marcus
and
quantity
cases
which
were
we
interpret
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
suppressing
and
destroying
evidence.
i
might
also
add
with
the
kentucky
statute
specifically
permit
a
peace
officer
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
for
a
misdemeanor
that
is
committed
in
his
presence.
and
also
in
answer
to
a
earlier
question
i
would
say
there
are
many
instances
a
police
officer
must
make
a
quick
judgment
concerning
an
obscene
situation
and
the
peace
officers
in
most
instances
and
all
instances
are
law
abiding
officers
are
sworn
to
a
particular
duty.
the
material
here
which
was
a
film
differs
from
books
and
pamphlets.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
right.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
well,
i
think
there
might
be
two
answers
to
that
sir.
first
the
case
we're
involved
in
here
was
a
crime
that
was
committed
in
the
officer's
presence
and
second
we're
dealing
with
a
film
as
opposed
to
a
book.
there
is
a
big
difference
in
a
film.
films
can
be
altered
quickly.
they
can
be
changed,
certain
objectionable
portions
can
be
quickly
taken
out.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes.
i
am
not
surely
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
there
was
no
warrant,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
there
was
an
arrest
in
the
officer's
presence.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
and
we
maintained
that
you
do
not
have
to
have
the
prior
adversary
hearing
or
determination
vel
non
ahead
of
time.
what
you
need
is
a
determination
of
probable
cause.
in
this
case
the
sheriff
made
that
determination.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that
is
a
part
of,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
well,
it
is
--
there
has
been
a
number
of
cases
in
the
lower
court,
specially
the
district
courts
that
have
held,
you
could
have
seizure
and
then
they
been
sometimes
overturned,
a
number
of
state
courts
the
same
way,
they
have
been
overturned
but
there
is
still
some
cases
left.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
not
to
my
recollection,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
well
as
we
maintain
mr.
justice
white
in
our
brief,
we
feel
that
it's
not
unreasonable
to
require
under
certain
circumstances
a
second
copy
to
be
kept.
if
there
is
a
probability
or
a
possibility
that
this
is
an
obscene
movie.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
believe
there
is
substance
in
the
alteration
theory,
yes
sir.
i
also
believe
that
there
is
some
substance
in
the
difficulty
in
which
we
face
where
a
operator
may
remove
that
film
and
send
it
to
another
state
very
quickly
because
most
of
these
films
are
on
a
schedule
of
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
sir.
one
film
for
evidentiary
purposes
only.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
the
question.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
sir?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
if
that
were
the
only
print,
then
in
that
case
i
would
suggest
a
motion
whereby
maybe
some
security
could
be
given
that
the
film
would
be
returned
in
its
original
shape
for
use
in
the
trial,
could
be
--
some
limitations
could
be
put
on
it.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
can
state
that
outside
the
record
to
my
knowledge,
if
it
please
the
court,
it's
showing
here
in
town.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
in
washington,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
it's
my
understanding
that's
showing,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
haven't
seen
it
sir
in
washington,
i
couldn't
tell
you.
it
could
be
contented
that
there
could
be
other
evidence
such
as
oral
statements
admitted
to
show
the
obscenity
of
a
particular
film.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
the
kentucky
law
though
says
that
it
is
proper
to
seize
the
evidence,
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
there
was
a
proper
arrest
and
it's
my
understanding
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
there
is
a
need
for
a
prior
adversary
hearing
and
it's
of
course,
our
contention
that
it
is
not
necessary.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
accept
that
in
this
case
there
was
not
just
a
sheriff.
there
was
also
the
chief
prosecuting
attorney
for
that
district
was
present.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
he
is
going
to
be
the
one
that
charged
with
bringing
the
prosecution
obviously
since
the
monkey
would
be
his
back
so
to
speak,
he
would
have
reason
to
make
certain
that
there
is
probable
cause
before
making
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
he
is
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
couldn't
possibly
do
that,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
i
thought
you
asked
for
a
search
warrant
is
concerned,
i
misunderstood
you?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
the
record
mr.
justice
marshall
shows
that
the
sheriff
was
--
had
been
a
sheriff
for
some
ten
years.
it
shows
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
statute,
in
fact,
as
he
quoted
it
during
the
trial
on
the
issue,
he
knew
what
the
statute
was
and
i
think
a
man
of
common
intelligence
can
determine
what
is
prurient.
if
this
material
taken
as
a
whole
appeals
to
prurient
interest
and
is
without
redeeming
social
value,
this
is
not
a
determination,
a
final
determination
on
the
matter.
it
is
a
determination
of
a
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
but
of
course,
if
it
is
not
obscene
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
of
course,
if
it
is
not
obscene,
it
would
be
returned.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
that
he
has
any
expertise
other
than
being
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
because
he
could
observe
that
the
situation
that
is
occurring
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
did
appeal
to
prurient
interest.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
not
for
misdemeanor,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
was
going
to
mention
that,
sir.
what
appeared
to
me
that
if
a
jury
can
make
a
determination
that
a
particular
film
is
obscene,
this
would
likewise
be
true
for
a
peace
officer,
at
least
as
far
as
probable
cause
is
concerned.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir,
that
would
be
my
point.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir,
it
was
a
drive-in
which
without
getting
to
the
rape
or
robbery
case,
at
least
the
deputy
sheriff
was
to
the
side
of
the
movie
theater
and
was
observing
that
from
a
post
outside
of
the
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
it
was
a
little
street,
a
road
to
the
side
of
the
drive-in
theater.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
he
could
see
the
nude
scenes
that
were
going
on
from
that
area,
yes
sir.
i
might
also
point
out
the
difference
between
the
films
and
the
books
is
that
you
can
purchase
books
for
use
in
evidence
whereas
in
the
case
of
a
film
being
shown
in
a
drive-in
theater,
you
can't
very
easily
purchase
that
for
use
in
evidence.
and
as
we
say
the
film
is
a
best
evidence
and
it
will
provide
a
fair
basis
for
a
decision
of
the
court
not
only
for
the
prosecution,
but
also
for
the
defense
because
obviously
if
we're
talking
about
certain
isolated
segments,
this
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
problems
or
the
definition
involved
in
roth.
so
the
film
itself
taken
as
a
whole
must
be
obtained
in
order
to
make
a
decision
in
this
case.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
ideas
that
are
conveyed
in
cindy
and
donna
are
probably
not
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
be
a
tremendous
abridgment
of
first
amendment
rights.
cindy
and
donna
is
basically
a
business
proposition.
it's
not
not
like
a
book
like,
say
mein
kampf
or
story
of
lenin
or
something
that
might
be
of
necessity
that
the
information
immediately
reach
the
public.
cindy--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
sir.
well,
i
am
not
sure,
it's
in
the
record.
i
think
he
was
--
yes,
he
was
told
by
the
sheriff
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
place.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
on
this
place,
yes
sir.
it
had
been
shown
for
two
days
prior
to
the
seizure.
so
we
are
saying
that
absent
a
pattern
of
harassment
or
an
attempt
to
suppress
ideas,
a
seizure
of
obscene
material
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
is
beneficial
to
judge
--
justice,
both
for
the
prosecution
and
the
defense.
since
this
court
has
stated
in
roth
and
later
in
reidel
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
there
is
no
basis
for
placing
hurdles
in
front
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
prosecution
of
their
duties.
this
film
as
we
say
was
admittedly
obscene,
it's
not
allegedly
obscene.
it
is
an
obscene
film
requiring
an
adversary
hearing
as
suggested
by
petitioner,
would
put
law
enforcement
officials
on
a
untenable
position
of
trying
to
enforce
laws
while
which
this
court
and
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
say
are
lawful,
while
putting
obstacles
and
the
best
means
--
for
the
best
means
of
doing
so
in
the
way
of
the
law
enforcement
officers.
in
this
respect,
i
think
it's
important
that
we
enforce
white
collar
crime,
laws
against
white
collar
crime
just
as
much
as
we
do
crimes
of
violence.
obviously,
if
you
can
get
by
with
white
collar
crimes
such
as
obscenity
or
consumer
protection
or
environmental
laws,
this
breaks
down
a
respect
for
the
judiciary
and
the
law
enforcement
officials
if
they
can
see
this
going
on
here
and
the
other
man
who
does
a
crime
of
violence
is
immediately
placed
in
custody
and
tried.
as
we
noted
earlier
the
petitioner
did
not
move
for
return
of
his
material.
we
feel
that
it
can
be
assumed
that
his
purpose
for
this
motion
which
he
made
before
the
court
was
for
the
purpose
of
suppression
of
an
obscene
film
to
avoid
prosecution.
there
was
a
speedy
review
of
the
action
taken
by
taking
the
matter
before
the
grand
jury
of
pulaski
county
the
next
day.
and
your
honor,
as
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
state
that
in
an
attempt
not
to
overstate
my
case,
in
my
brief
i
may
have
understated
my
case
on
a
particular
point.
on
page
11,
i
stated
although
a
failure
to
indict
by
grand
jury
would
not
have
assured
petitioner
of
his
release
or
the
release
of
his
film,
the
fact
that
it
went
before
the
grand
jury
was
showing
a
good
faith.
i
would
like
to
correct
any
ambiguity
there
by
saying
that
pursuant
to
the
kentucky
rules
of
criminal
procedure
5.22,
if
a
defendant
is
not
indicted
by
grand
jury,
he
must
be
released,
however,
a
subsequent
grand
jury
could
later
indict
it.
this
is
marcus
v.
bradley,
385
s.w.
2nd
165.
a
failure
of
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
to
indict
would
have
resulted
in
the
release
of
petitioner,
immediate
release
and
he
would
have
remained
free
absent
a
subsequent
grand
jury
indictment
and
presumably
his
film
would
have
been
released
with
him.
i
might
add
that
if
his
film
was
not
released,
he
could
have
made
a
motion
to
the
court
for
its
release
and
if
the
lower
court
refused
to
do
a
it
a
writ
mandamus
would
be
a
proper
remedy
before
court
of
appeals.
this
was
indicated
in
the
case
of
johnson
versus
commonwealth,
475
s.w.
2nd
893
which
was
decided
subsequent
to
the
case
before
this
court.
there
was
a
speedy
trial
in
this
case,the
22
days.
this
was
done
in
order
to
zealously
guard
petitioner's
rights.
this
court
recently
in
u.s.
versus
37
photographs
held
that
where
there
were
seizure
of
allegedly
obscene
material
by
custom
officials,
there
would
not
be
an
undue
hardship
if
the
forfeiture
proceedings
were
commenced
within
14
days
and
completed
it
within
60
days
of
their
commencement.
this
would
allow
a
total
of
74
days
from
seizure
to
decision.
now
in
our
present
case
before
our
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
there
was
seizure
on
september
29th,
1970
and
indictment
the
following
day
and
the
trial
was
concluded
on
october
21st,
1970.
this
was
some
22
days
after
the
arrest
and
seizure.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
significantly
less
than
the
74
days
that
was
indicated
in
the
37
photographs
case.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
sir,
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record.
i
assume
it
could
be
done
fairly
easily
and
without
a
whole
lot
of
cost.
pulaski
county,
kentucky
is
not
like
new
york
city
or
some
of
the
big
cities.
pulaski
county,
kentucky
is
essentially
a
rural
area.
requiring
an
adversary
hearing
would
in
my
estimation,
penalize
rural
areas.
for
instance,
in
pulaski
county,
there
is
one
circuit
judge
who
kind
of
covers
two
counties.
now
there
are
other
lesser
judges
but
our
main
judge
is
the
circuit
judge
and
he
covers
two
counties.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
magistrates,
i
believe
can
issue.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
we
have
county
judge
too.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
in
a
warrant
situation,
i
would
suppose
that
is
true.
there
are
not,
however,
judges
that
are
quickly
available
to
be
able
to
go
and
have
a
prior
adversary
hearing
before
this
film
which
we
submit
is
fugitive
in
nature
and
can
be
shifted
to
another
state
and
the
lost,
the
evidence
lost
to
the
commission
of
the
crime.
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
commonwealth
has
used
careful
procedures
to
protect
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
we're
basically
talking
about
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
not
necessarily
a
first
amendment
case.
the
prior
adversary
hearing
situation
which
has
been
interpreted
by
many
of
the
courts
is
simply
not
a
workable
solution,
it
won't
work.
what
is
needed
is
a
firm
determination
by
this
court
that
a
peace
officer
can
make
arrest
and
seizure
of
the
film,
when
that
arrest
and
seizure
is
for
the
purposes
of
using
in
evidence,
the
material.
for
these
reasons,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
holding
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
as
has
been
stated
that's
before
the
court
is
in
the
absence
of
a
prior
adversary
hearing
is
the
seizure
incident
to
arrest
of
allegedly
obscene
material,
a
violation
of
due
process.
my
answer
of
course,
is
no.
let
me
go
into
if
i
may
a
few
the
facts
that
may
not
have
been
fully
brought
out
before.
on
september
28,
1970,
the
deputy
sheriff
of
pulaski
county
observed
approximately
30
minutes
of
the
film
"cindy
and
donna"
from
advantage
point
outside
of
the
theater
at
a
road
nearby.
thereafter
he
reported
to
a
superior,
the
sheriff
of
pulaski
county.
the
next
evening
as
was
noted,
on
september
29th,
1970,
the
sheriff
accompanied,
in
this
case
by
the
commonwealth
attorney,
who
is
the
chief
prosecuting
officer
for
that
district,
paid
admission
for
entrance
into
the
theater
for
showing
of
the
film.
after
viewing
of
the
entire
film,
the
entire
film,
the
sheriff
proceeded
to
the
projection
booth
and
arrested
the
petitioner,
mr.
roaden,
who
was
at
that
time
changing
the
carton.
i
believe
it
was
on
the
projection
theater
was
upside
down.
the
sheriff
seized
the
film
incident
to
the
lawful
arrest.
the
following
day
on
september
30th,
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
who
returned
the
indictment,
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
case
was
had
and
a
verdict
was
entered
october
21st,
1970.
now
there
are
certain
facts
in
this
case
they
are
somewhat
peculiar.
we
take
issue
with
my
brother
wicker,
concerning
whether
the
film's
obscenity
has
been
acknowledged.
petitioner
obviously
acknowledged
the
obscenity
of
the
film
as
was
earlier
noted
and
during
the
course
of
appeal
through
the
courts,
he
is
not
seriously
contended
otherwise.
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall
in
our
opinion
the
film
was
obscene
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
also
moved
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
when
is
it
or
has
it
been?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
it
is
in
the
custody
of
the
court
of
appeals,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
until
this
day,
yes
sir
of
kentucky.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no
sir,
because
even
to
this
day
and
this
was
my
next
point,
petitioner
has
not
moved
for
the
return
of
the
film,
his
moved
for
the
film
which
was
admittedly
obscene
to
be
suppressed
in
evidence
but
he
has
not
moved
for
a
return
of
this
film
so
he
might
later
show
it.
copies
of
cindy
and
donna.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
sir,
that
is
correct,
for
use
it
is
evidence.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
would
say
that
the
burden
would
be
upon
petitioner
to
move
for
its
return.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no
sir.
extreme
caution
we
maintain
was
used
to
safeguard
against
infringement
of
petitioner's
constitution
right.
the
chief
prosecutor
for
the
district
accompanied
the
sheriff
in
this
case.
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
seizure
and
presumably
he
would
have
the
opportunity
to
advice
the
sheriff
on
the
probable
cause.
as
i
noted
the
grand
jury
the
next
day
affirmed,
and
confirmed
the
fact
that
there
was
probable
cause
and
they
returned
an
indictment
and
in
this
case
i
mean
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
trial
of
the
case
was
completed
some
22
days
after
the
original
arrest
and
seizure.
there
was
a
determination
within
that
period
of
time.
we
maintain
that
the
seizure
of
the
film
was
incidental
to
lawful
arrest
for
crime
which
was
committed
in
the
officer's
presence.
and
that
the
reason
for
the
seizure
of
this
film
was
for
as
used
as
best
evidence
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
not
for
the
purposes
of
suppressing
ideas
or
first
amendment
rights.
as
noted
by
our
kentucky
court
of
appeals
this
is
the
way
we
are
differentiating.
we
have
differentiated
the
marcus
and
quantity
cases
which
were
we
interpret
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
suppressing
and
destroying
evidence.
i
might
also
add
with
the
kentucky
statute
specifically
permit
a
peace
officer
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
for
a
misdemeanor
that
is
committed
in
his
presence.
and
also
in
answer
to
a
earlier
question
i
would
say
there
are
many
instances
a
police
officer
must
make
a
quick
judgment
concerning
an
obscene
situation
and
the
peace
officers
in
most
instances
and
all
instances
are
law
abiding
officers
are
sworn
to
a
particular
duty.
the
material
here
which
was
a
film
differs
from
books
and
pamphlets.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
right.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
well,
i
think
there
might
be
two
answers
to
that
sir.
first
the
case
we're
involved
in
here
was
a
crime
that
was
committed
in
the
officer's
presence
and
second
we're
dealing
with
a
film
as
opposed
to
a
book.
there
is
a
big
difference
in
a
film.
films
can
be
altered
quickly.
they
can
be
changed,
certain
objectionable
portions
can
be
quickly
taken
out.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes.
i
am
not
surely
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
there
was
no
warrant,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
there
was
an
arrest
in
the
officer's
presence.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
and
we
maintained
that
you
do
not
have
to
have
the
prior
adversary
hearing
or
determination
vel
non
ahead
of
time.
what
you
need
is
a
determination
of
probable
cause.
in
this
case
the
sheriff
made
that
determination.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that
is
a
part
of,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
well,
it
is
--
there
has
been
a
number
of
cases
in
the
lower
court,
specially
the
district
courts
that
have
held,
you
could
have
seizure
and
then
they
been
sometimes
overturned,
a
number
of
state
courts
the
same
way,
they
have
been
overturned
but
there
is
still
some
cases
left.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
not
to
my
recollection,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
well
as
we
maintain
mr.
justice
white
in
our
brief,
we
feel
that
it's
not
unreasonable
to
require
under
certain
circumstances
a
second
copy
to
be
kept.
if
there
is
a
probability
or
a
possibility
that
this
is
an
obscene
movie.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
believe
there
is
substance
in
the
alteration
theory,
yes
sir.
i
also
believe
that
there
is
some
substance
in
the
difficulty
in
which
we
face
where
a
operator
may
remove
that
film
and
send
it
to
another
state
very
quickly
because
most
of
these
films
are
on
a
schedule
of
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
sir.
one
film
for
evidentiary
purposes
only.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
the
question.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
sir?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
if
that
were
the
only
print,
then
in
that
case
i
would
suggest
a
motion
whereby
maybe
some
security
could
be
given
that
the
film
would
be
returned
in
its
original
shape
for
use
in
the
trial,
could
be
--
some
limitations
could
be
put
on
it.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
can
state
that
outside
the
record
to
my
knowledge,
if
it
please
the
court,
it's
showing
here
in
town.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
in
washington,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
it's
my
understanding
that's
showing,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
haven't
seen
it
sir
in
washington,
i
couldn't
tell
you.
it
could
be
contented
that
there
could
be
other
evidence
such
as
oral
statements
admitted
to
show
the
obscenity
of
a
particular
film.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
the
kentucky
law
though
says
that
it
is
proper
to
seize
the
evidence,
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
there
was
a
proper
arrest
and
it's
my
understanding
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
there
is
a
need
for
a
prior
adversary
hearing
and
it's
of
course,
our
contention
that
it
is
not
necessary.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
accept
that
in
this
case
there
was
not
just
a
sheriff.
there
was
also
the
chief
prosecuting
attorney
for
that
district
was
present.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
he
is
going
to
be
the
one
that
charged
with
bringing
the
prosecution
obviously
since
the
monkey
would
be
his
back
so
to
speak,
he
would
have
reason
to
make
certain
that
there
is
probable
cause
before
making
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
he
is
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
couldn't
possibly
do
that,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
i
thought
you
asked
for
a
search
warrant
is
concerned,
i
misunderstood
you?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
the
record
mr.
justice
marshall
shows
that
the
sheriff
was
--
had
been
a
sheriff
for
some
ten
years.
it
shows
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
statute,
in
fact,
as
he
quoted
it
during
the
trial
on
the
issue,
he
knew
what
the
statute
was
and
i
think
a
man
of
common
intelligence
can
determine
what
is
prurient.
if
this
material
taken
as
a
whole
appeals
to
prurient
interest
and
is
without
redeeming
social
value,
this
is
not
a
determination,
a
final
determination
on
the
matter.
it
is
a
determination
of
a
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
but
of
course,
if
it
is
not
obscene
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
of
course,
if
it
is
not
obscene,
it
would
be
returned.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
that
he
has
any
expertise
other
than
being
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
because
he
could
observe
that
the
situation
that
is
occurring
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
did
appeal
to
prurient
interest.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
not
for
misdemeanor,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
was
going
to
mention
that,
sir.
what
appeared
to
me
that
if
a
jury
can
make
a
determination
that
a
particular
film
is
obscene,
this
would
likewise
be
true
for
a
peace
officer,
at
least
as
far
as
probable
cause
is
concerned.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir,
that
would
be
my
point.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir,
it
was
a
drive-in
which
without
getting
to
the
rape
or
robbery
case,
at
least
the
deputy
sheriff
was
to
the
side
of
the
movie
theater
and
was
observing
that
from
a
post
outside
of
the
--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
it
was
a
little
street,
a
road
to
the
side
of
the
drive-in
theater.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
he
could
see
the
nude
scenes
that
were
going
on
from
that
area,
yes
sir.
i
might
also
point
out
the
difference
between
the
films
and
the
books
is
that
you
can
purchase
books
for
use
in
evidence
whereas
in
the
case
of
a
film
being
shown
in
a
drive-in
theater,
you
can't
very
easily
purchase
that
for
use
in
evidence.
and
as
we
say
the
film
is
a
best
evidence
and
it
will
provide
a
fair
basis
for
a
decision
of
the
court
not
only
for
the
prosecution,
but
also
for
the
defense
because
obviously
if
we're
talking
about
certain
isolated
segments,
this
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
problems
or
the
definition
involved
in
roth.
so
the
film
itself
taken
as
a
whole
must
be
obtained
in
order
to
make
a
decision
in
this
case.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
ideas
that
are
conveyed
in
cindy
and
donna
are
probably
not
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
be
a
tremendous
abridgment
of
first
amendment
rights.
cindy
and
donna
is
basically
a
business
proposition.
it's
not
not
like
a
book
like,
say
mein
kampf
or
story
of
lenin
or
something
that
might
be
of
necessity
that
the
information
immediately
reach
the
public.
cindy--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
sir.
well,
i
am
not
sure,
it's
in
the
record.
i
think
he
was
--
yes,
he
was
told
by
the
sheriff
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
place.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
on
this
place,
yes
sir.
it
had
been
shown
for
two
days
prior
to
the
seizure.
so
we
are
saying
that
absent
a
pattern
of
harassment
or
an
attempt
to
suppress
ideas,
a
seizure
of
obscene
material
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
is
beneficial
to
judge
--
justice,
both
for
the
prosecution
and
the
defense.
since
this
court
has
stated
in
roth
and
later
in
reidel
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
there
is
no
basis
for
placing
hurdles
in
front
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
prosecution
of
their
duties.
this
film
as
we
say
was
admittedly
obscene,
it's
not
allegedly
obscene.
it
is
an
obscene
film
requiring
an
adversary
hearing
as
suggested
by
petitioner,
would
put
law
enforcement
officials
on
a
untenable
position
of
trying
to
enforce
laws
while
which
this
court
and
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
say
are
lawful,
while
putting
obstacles
and
the
best
means
--
for
the
best
means
of
doing
so
in
the
way
of
the
law
enforcement
officers.
in
this
respect,
i
think
it's
important
that
we
enforce
white
collar
crime,
laws
against
white
collar
crime
just
as
much
as
we
do
crimes
of
violence.
obviously,
if
you
can
get
by
with
white
collar
crimes
such
as
obscenity
or
consumer
protection
or
environmental
laws,
this
breaks
down
a
respect
for
the
judiciary
and
the
law
enforcement
officials
if
they
can
see
this
going
on
here
and
the
other
man
who
does
a
crime
of
violence
is
immediately
placed
in
custody
and
tried.
as
we
noted
earlier
the
petitioner
did
not
move
for
return
of
his
material.
we
feel
that
it
can
be
assumed
that
his
purpose
for
this
motion
which
he
made
before
the
court
was
for
the
purpose
of
suppression
of
an
obscene
film
to
avoid
prosecution.
there
was
a
speedy
review
of
the
action
taken
by
taking
the
matter
before
the
grand
jury
of
pulaski
county
the
next
day.
and
your
honor,
as
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
state
that
in
an
attempt
not
to
overstate
my
case,
in
my
brief
i
may
have
understated
my
case
on
a
particular
point.
on
page
11,
i
stated
although
a
failure
to
indict
by
grand
jury
would
not
have
assured
petitioner
of
his
release
or
the
release
of
his
film,
the
fact
that
it
went
before
the
grand
jury
was
showing
a
good
faith.
i
would
like
to
correct
any
ambiguity
there
by
saying
that
pursuant
to
the
kentucky
rules
of
criminal
procedure
5.22,
if
a
defendant
is
not
indicted
by
grand
jury,
he
must
be
released,
however,
a
subsequent
grand
jury
could
later
indict
it.
this
is
marcus
v.
bradley,
385
s.w.
2nd
165.
a
failure
of
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
to
indict
would
have
resulted
in
the
release
of
petitioner,
immediate
release
and
he
would
have
remained
free
absent
a
subsequent
grand
jury
indictment
and
presumably
his
film
would
have
been
released
with
him.
i
might
add
that
if
his
film
was
not
released,
he
could
have
made
a
motion
to
the
court
for
its
release
and
if
the
lower
court
refused
to
do
a
it
a
writ
mandamus
would
be
a
proper
remedy
before
court
of
appeals.
this
was
indicated
in
the
case
of
johnson
versus
commonwealth,
475
s.w.
2nd
893
which
was
decided
subsequent
to
the
case
before
this
court.
there
was
a
speedy
trial
in
this
case,the
22
days.
this
was
done
in
order
to
zealously
guard
petitioner's
rights.
this
court
recently
in
u.s.
versus
37
photographs
held
that
where
there
were
seizure
of
allegedly
obscene
material
by
custom
officials,
there
would
not
be
an
undue
hardship
if
the
forfeiture
proceedings
were
commenced
within
14
days
and
completed
it
within
60
days
of
their
commencement.
this
would
allow
a
total
of
74
days
from
seizure
to
decision.
now
in
our
present
case
before
our
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
there
was
seizure
on
september
29th,
1970
and
indictment
the
following
day
and
the
trial
was
concluded
on
october
21st,
1970.
this
was
some
22
days
after
the
arrest
and
seizure.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
significantly
less
than
the
74
days
that
was
indicated
in
the
37
photographs
case.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
sir,
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record.
i
assume
it
could
be
done
fairly
easily
and
without
a
whole
lot
of
cost.
pulaski
county,
kentucky
is
not
like
new
york
city
or
some
of
the
big
cities.
pulaski
county,
kentucky
is
essentially
a
rural
area.
requiring
an
adversary
hearing
would
in
my
estimation,
penalize
rural
areas.
for
instance,
in
pulaski
county,
there
is
one
circuit
judge
who
kind
of
covers
two
counties.
now
there
are
other
lesser
judges
but
our
main
judge
is
the
circuit
judge
and
he
covers
two
counties.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
magistrates,
i
believe
can
issue.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
we
have
county
judge
too.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
in
a
warrant
situation,
i
would
suppose
that
is
true.
there
are
not,
however,
judges
that
are
quickly
available
to
be
able
to
go
and
have
a
prior
adversary
hearing
before
this
film
which
we
submit
is
fugitive
in
nature
and
can
be
shifted
to
another
state
and
the
lost,
the
evidence
lost
to
the
commission
of
the
crime.
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
commonwealth
has
used
careful
procedures
to
protect
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
we're
basically
talking
about
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
not
necessarily
a
first
amendment
case.
the
prior
adversary
hearing
situation
which
has
been
interpreted
by
many
of
the
courts
is
simply
not
a
workable
solution,
it
won't
work.
what
is
needed
is
a
firm
determination
by
this
court
that
a
peace
officer
can
make
arrest
and
seizure
of
the
film,
when
that
arrest
and
seizure
is
for
the
purposes
of
using
in
evidence,
the
material.
for
these
reasons,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
holding
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
thank
you,
your
honor.
