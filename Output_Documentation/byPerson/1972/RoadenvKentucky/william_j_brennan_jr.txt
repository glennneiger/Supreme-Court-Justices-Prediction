justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
the
issue
then
not
be
probable
cause,
but
obscenity
down
on
of
the
film?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
probable
cause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
wicker,
i
thought,
perhaps
alone,
in
marcus
and
quantity
of
books
both
of
which
involved
magazines
as
i
remember,
i
thought
we
held
the
proceedings,
you
know,
it's
a
warrant
proceeding,
had
to
be
one
in
which
there
was
the
determination
not
a
probable
cause,
but
of
the
obscenity
vel
non
of
material
before
they
could
be
seized,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
prove
too
much?[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
mr.
bullock?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
marcus
case,
the
police
officer
there
involved
went
to
the
various
newsstands
and
picked
up
a
copy
of
each
of
the
magazines
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
he
went
before
a
magistrate
on
sworn
complaints
in
which
he
stated
that
each
of
those
places,
each
of
the
news
dealers,
and
i
am
quoting,
kept
for
the
purpose
of
sale
of
obscene
publications.”
and
then
got
the
--on
the
basis
of
that
the
circuit
judge
issued
the
six
warrants
which
weren't
executed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
held
with
that
procedure
did
not
comport
with
constitutional
due
process
and
liability
limit
implications
involved,
did
we
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
does
that
procedure
differ
and
how
is
the
procedure
here
differ
any
from
that
was
done
there.
you
say
this
was
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
was
a
seizure
and
similarly
nobody
was
arrested
at
that
time
because
that
was
a,
as
you
have
pointed
out
is
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
other
than
that
how
is
only
difference
between
two
procedures?
why
does
the
seizure
of
the
operator
make
that
any
different
from
due
process
in
first
amendment
context?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
our
point
is
not
whether
statement
have
a
procedure
to
seize
a
film
and
prevent
its
being
altered.
our
question
is,
isn't
it,
whether
or
not
the
statement
have
a
procedure
before
seizure
of
the
film
itself,
without
first
determining
its
obscenity
as
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
we
concerned
with
here
is
whether
you
can
issue
a
warrant
as
was
done
in
this
case,
wasn't
it,
on
probable
cause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what,
just
an
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
question
is
whether
you
can
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
having
a
determination
of
the
obscenity
vel
non
of
a
motion
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
on
the
grounds
of
difference
between
films
and
magazine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
there
are
good
many
cases
that
have
held
the
other
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
most
of
them
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
that's
the
only
print
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
is
the
only
print
that's
supplied
to
the
exhibitor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
know
here
whether
there
are
more
than
one
print,
i
guess,
mr.
justice
powell
asked
you
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
washington?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
name
the
theater.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
a
drive-in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning
a
bridge
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
could
see
it
from
the
street.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
officer
on
that
side
of
street
just
by
happenstance
or
he
goes
there
for
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
this
very
place?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
issues
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
issues
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
mean
you
have
available
magistrates,
so
if
warrant
had
been
required
here
i
gather
that
had
been
an
available
magistrate
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
the
issue
then
not
be
probable

but
obscenity
down
