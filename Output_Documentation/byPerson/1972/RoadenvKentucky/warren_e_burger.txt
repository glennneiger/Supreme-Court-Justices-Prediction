mr.
wicker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
if
on
monday
night
the
sheriff
went
with
the
local
magistrate,
a
person
authorized
to
issue
warrants
and
the
magistrate
observed
the
film
and
then
on
tuesday
morning
issued
a
warrant,
would
that
satisfy
your
claims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
want
a
--
you
would
want
an
adversary
proceeding
in
which
you
could
appear
to
try
to
persuade
the
magistrate
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
going
to
tie
out
the
issue
of
obscenity
in
the
warrant
issuing
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
it's
more
sensitive
than
searching
a
private
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
kentucky
law
do
you
have
an
adversary
proceeding
to
get
a
search
warrant
to
search
a
private
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
what
is
there
to
try,
what
would
be
there
to
try
if
the
determination
was
a
determination
vel
non
of
the
obscenity.
what
do
you
need
a
further
proceeding
for
is
that
by
way
of
appellate
review
or
trial
de
novo?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
taking
the
other
time,
if
the
magistrate
issues
the
warrant
on
a
showing
which
must
reach
the
level
of
determination
of
obscenity
rather
than
probable
cause
or
probable
obscenity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
might
be
in
the
trial
right
the
next
morning
after
showing
of
the
film,
would
you
not,would
be
res
judicata
of
the
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
a
policeman
on
the
beach
witnesses
conduct
which
he
regards
as
obscene
and
offends
particular
ordinances
or
statutes,
doesn't
he
have
to
make
a
judgment
then
and
there
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
and
take
the
person
in
the
custody?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
suppose
--
suppose
the
man
says
that
he
is
picketing
for
something
or
other
but
he
is
engaging
in
a
lurid
and
obscene
exhibition
in
that
process
carrying
a
picket
sign
at
the
same
time,
doesn't
the
policeman
have
to
make
judgments
constantly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
he
doesn't
--
a
policeman
in
these
circumstances
isn't
making
any
final
determination,
is
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
how
is
your
situation
different
in
this
case
with
that
argument
than
if
you
had
been
trying
a
man,
defending
a
man
on
a
first
degree
murder
charge
and
you
argued
to
the
jury
that
yes
undoubtedly
he
did
kill
the
victim,
but
it
was
an
accident
and
therefore
it
should
be
a
manslaughter
verdict
and
not
a
first
degree
murder
verdict.
is
this
any
different?
if
so
how
is
it
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
wicker.
mr.
bullock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
it
be
wrong
with
having
the
magistrate
and
the
sheriff
and
the
prosecutor
go
and
see
the
movie
on
monday,
issue
the
warrant
on
tuesday
and
go
out
and
seize
it
then,
if
a
non-adversary
proceeding
would
satisfy
kentucky
law
and
the
constitution,
a
number
of
ifs
in
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
wouldn't
--
would
it
not
follow
is
a
matter
of
course
that
if
lay
jurors
can
do
it,
a
peace
officer
can
do
it
on
the
lesser
standard
of
probable
cause
whereas
the
lay
juror
has
got
to
find
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
what
it
cost
to
rent
this
film
and
how
long
it
would
have
taken
him
to
get
a
substitute
film?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
bullock,
mr.
wicker,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
state's
position
here
that
one
exhibition
reaches
many,
many
people,
are
you
supporting
the
state's
position
on
that
score?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it's
obscenity
do
you
concede
that
it
--
they
are
not
entitled
to
exhibit
it
and
people
are
not
entitled
to
receive
it,
if
it
is
obscenity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
