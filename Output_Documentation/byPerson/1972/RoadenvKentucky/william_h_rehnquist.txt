justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wicker
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
the
commissioner
who
wrote
the
opinion
said
that,
during
the
trial
of
the
action,
you
conceded
the
obscenity
of
the
film,
is
that
a
correct
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
an
adversary
hearing
had
been
pretty
much
of
a
charade
in
this
case,
if
when
you
first
got
your
chance
to
have
an
adversary
hearing
and
the
trial
you
conceded
the
obscenity
of
the
film?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wicker,
returning
for
a
moment
to
the
question
i
asked
you
earlier,
i
call
your
attention
to
page
37
of
the
appendix
and
what
was
apparently
your
argument
at
the
jury,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
37.
you
say
in
the
film
which
you
saw
yesterday
was
all
--
if
the
film
which
you
saw
yesterday
was
all,
was
on
trial
here,
i
would
not
be
here.
i
would
be
good
enough
to
tell
you
at
the
outset
that
on
behalf
of
mr.
roaden.
i
am
not
going
to
get
up
here
and
defend
the
film
observed
yesterday,
you
know,
the
revolting
scenes
in
it
or
try
to
argue
or
persuade
you
that
those
scenes
were
not
obscene.
now
i
take
it
that's
what
the
commissioner
were
referred
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
i
would
certainly
be
inclined
to
think
that
supported
his
suggestion
that
you
had
conceded
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
always
had
any
particular
expertise
when
they
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty?
