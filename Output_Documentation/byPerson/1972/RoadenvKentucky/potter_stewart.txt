i
don't
see,
to
follow
up
the
question
of
chief
justice,
i
don't
see
why
in
your
case,
may
be
you
are
concerned
about
in
hearing
the
success
of
the
next
case,
but
taking
your
case
alone,
i
don't
see
why
you
need
to
contend
that
the
constitution
requires
an
adversary
hearing.
you
simply
i
should
suppose
make
the
contend
that
the
constitution
requires
that
there
can
be
no
seizure
except
by
warrant
issued
by
magistrate,
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
yet
all
through
your
brief,
you
talk
about
of
an
adversary
hearing
being
required.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
there
isn't
a
need
for
a
prior
adversary
hearing,
you
would
lose
if
the
constitution
requires
a
determination
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
would
you
not,
if
there
is
just
simply
a
requirement
of
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
he
is
not
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
is
a
prosecutor?
