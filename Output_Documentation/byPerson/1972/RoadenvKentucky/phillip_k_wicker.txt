mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
single
issue
in
this
case
arises
out
of
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
in
the
circuit
court
of
pulaski
county,
kentucky
following
a
jury
trial
for
violating
kentucky's
obscenity
statute
which
is
kentucky
revised
statute,
chapter
436,
section
101.
petitioner
was
convicted
under
subsection
(2)
of
that
statue
which
may
be
found
on
pages
3
and
4
of
the
brief
for
petitioner.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
simple
and
for
the
most
part
undisputed.
on
the
9
--
september
the
29th,
1970,
the
sheriff
of
pulaski
county,
kentucky
purchased
a
ticket
to
highway
27
drive-in
theater
which
was
managed
by
the
petitioner.
the
sheriff
viewed
the
entire
film
being
exhibited
that
evening
which
was
entitled
cindy
and
donna.
immediately
following
the
exhibition
of
the
film,
the
sheriff
proceeded
to
the
projection
booth
of
the
theater
and
there
arrested
the
petitioner
upon
a
charge
of
violating
the
statue
and
seized
the
film.
at
the
time
the
arrest
was
made
and
the
film
was
seized,
there
was
no
warrant
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
issued
by
any
magistrate.
no
magistrate
had
viewed
the
film.
there
were
no
descriptive
affidavits
before,
for
instance,
any
magistrate.
immediately
there
was
no
hearing
of
any
kind
before
a
judicial
officer,
advisory
or
ex
parte
to
focus
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
the
sheriff
upon
viewing
the
film,
ex
parte
and
on
his
own
made
a
determination
that
the
film
was
obscene
and
such
ex
parte
determination
on
his
part
led
to
the
arrest
and
seizure
of
the
film.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
no,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
we,
we
would
ask
a
meaningful
opportunity
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
to
be
heard
to
counter
the
judgment
of
the
local
law
enforcement
officer,
that
the
film
was
obscene.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
i
think
the
issue
would
be
probable
obscenity
of
the
film.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
your
honor,
we
believe
the
issue
of
obscenity
is
so
sensitive
and
this
court
had
said
that
it's
separated
by
only
a
down
and
uncertain
line
and
that
separation
calls
for
the
use
of
sensitive
tools.
we
believe
that
it
is
required
here.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
yes.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
my
reading
of
the
marcus
and
books
case
convinces
me
that
adversary
hearing
pertains
to
probable
obscenity.
you
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
further
proceeding
if
it
were
determined
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
to
believe
the
film
to
be
obscene.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
there
would
be
no
need
for
further
trial
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
no,
your
honor
at
the
time.
on
the
day
following
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
and
the
seizure
of
this
film,
the
sheriff
took
it
to
the
grand
jury
of
pulaski
county
and
an
indictment
was
returned
charging
the
petitioner
with
the
offense
for
which
he
was
convicted.
the
petitioner
three
days
later
pleaded
not
guilty
and
the
case
was
set
for
trail
on
the
20th
of
october.
on
the
12th
of
october
the
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
this
film
as
evidence
and
to
dismiss
the
indictment
contending
as
he
does
here
today,
that
the
film
was
illegally
seized
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law
because
there
had
been
no
adversary
hearing
prior
to
the
seizure.
the
motion
to
suppress
and
dismiss
the
indictment
was
overruled
and
petitioner's
trial
began.
now
petitioner
at
the
trial
again
objected
to
admission
of
the
film
in
evidence
and
renewed
his
motion
to
suppress.
the
trial
court
overruled.
the
issue
was
again
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
and
that
court
affirmed
the
conviction
on
june
the
25th
1971
and
denied
a
re-hearing.
at
no
point,
prior
to
the
seizure
that
the
petitioner
or
anyone
in
his
behalf
had
an
opportunity
to
contest
the
judgment
of
the
sheriff
that
this
film
was
obscene.
so
that's
presented
the
single
issue
of
whether
in
the
absence
of
a
prior
adversary
hearing,
the
seizure
incident
to
arrest
of
allegedly
obscene
material
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
maintain
that,
that
it
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
closing
argument
and
we
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
closing
argument
will
disclose
to
this
court
that
was
trial
strategy
and
even,
even
if
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
a
concession
made
in
the
closing
argument,
we
nevertheless
maintain
that
all
material
regardless
of
its
eventual
characterization
as
obscene
or
non-obscene
is
clothed
with
the
same
procedural
safeguards
until
there
has
been
an
adversary
hearing.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
we
did
not
concede
the
obscenity
and
--
but
for
the
protection
of
material
that
is
not
obscene
whether
this
material
will
turn
out
to
be
obscene
or
not
or
whether
it
was
conceded
that
any
time
during
the
trial,
we
don't
think
it
is
important.
we
think
it
was
clothed
with
the
same
procedural
safeguards
as
non-obscene
material
until
the
determination
in
the
adversary
hearing.
petitioner
and
his
contention
here
relies
on
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
marcus
versus
search
warrant
properly,
a
quantity
of
books
versus
kansas,
and
lee
art
theatre
versus
virginia.
and
the
gist
again
of
petitioner's
contention
is
that
discretion
to
seize
allegedly
obscene
material
cannot
be
confided
to
law
enforcement
officers
without
some
safeguards
for
the
protection
of
non-obscene
material.
and
a
seizure
without
a
warrant
such
as
occurred
in
this
case,
there
were
no
safeguards
at
all
to
prevent
this
question
of
not
obscene
film
which
are
protected
by
the
constitution.
and
because
first
amendment
rights
are
involved
here
the
sheriff
of
pulaski
county,
kentucky
have
no
discretion
to
say
that
a
crime
have
been
committed
in
his
presence.
a
state
is
not
free,
this
court
said
in
marcus
to
adopt
whatever
procedures
it
pleases
for
dealing
with
obscenity
without
regard
to
the
possible
consequences
for
constitutionally
protected
speech.
and
the
line
between
speech
unconditionally
guaranteed
and
speech
which
may
legitimately
be
punished
is
finely
drawn,
it's
dim
and
uncertain
and
separation
of
the
legitimate
for
the
illegitimate,
calls
for
the
use
of
sensitive
tool.
so
here
we
have
an
ex
parte
non-judicial
determination
of
probable
obscenity
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
the
thief.
the
sheriff
acted
as
judge
and
in
a
sense
no
where
was
there
any
procedure
designed
to
focus
searching
--
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
this
film
had
shown
for
two
nights
prior
to
the
seizure.
there
was
no
emergency
or
danger
to
the
community
which
compelled
the
seizure
without
at
least
a
warrant
or
some
prior
judicial
scrutiny.
the
test
of
obscenity
as
laid
down
of
this
court
in
the
roth
case
as
so
apply
then
it
must
be
made
judicial.
to
permit
unbridled
discretion
on
law
enforcement
officers
to
apply
such
tests
amounts
to
a
vague
understanding
of
this
delegation
of
judicial
power.
we
believe
that
marcus
and
books
required
the
court
of
law
to
make
the
determination
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
the
film
obscene
and
this
only
after
a
meaning
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
police
officers
in
the
field
are
not
equipped
to
apply
the
test
and
separate
the
legitimate
from
the
illegitimate.
while
police
officers
may
be
property
trained
experts
in
the
detection
and
proper
identification
of
the
usual
paraphernalia
of
crime,
they
do
not
enjoy
such
a
status
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
literature
and
movies.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
that's
true
in
most
cases
mr.
chief
justice
but
not
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
i
don't
believe
that
a
police
officer
in
the
field
is
capable
of
applying
roth
test
with
respect
to
obscenity.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
but
once
he
makes
his
determination
and
seizes
the
film
then
there
is
the
danger
that
non-obscene
material
has
been
restrained.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe
that
any
requirement
that
a
theater
owner
–
he
–
two
films
on
him
is
too
burdensome
and
are
made
--
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
i
still
feel
that
the
petitioner's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
involved
and
that
even
the
seizure
of
one
film
imposes
a
restraint,
whether
it's
one
film
or
dozen
films.
that
particular
film
was
restrained.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
my
answer
would
be
the
same
mr.
justice
powell
because
we
believe
the
first
amendment
makes
no
reference
to
quantity
that
it
affords
one
book,
one
film,
the
same
protection.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
we
maintain
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
we
did
not
concede
the
obscenity
of
the
film
that
this
was
trial
strategy.
the
jury
which
heard
this
--
which
saw
this
film
and
came
back
to
the
courtroom
was
ready
to,
if
protected
law
has
permitted
it
would
have
hung
this
man.
they
would
have
given
him
the
death
penalty.
we
found
that
there
was
no
chance
of
persuading
this
jury
that
the
film
was
not
obscene.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
is
much
difference
in
that
the
jury
had
to
make
two
findings.
first
was,
is
the
film
obscene
and
second
was
is
defendant
guilty
of
showing
an
obscene
film
and
we
concentrated
only
second
finding,
conviction
of
the
defendant
in
regard.
but
now
we
didn't
have
much
chance
to
convince
that
jury
that
this
film
wasn't
obscene.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
no
it
doesn't,
mr.
justice
marshall
because
--
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
justice
marshall
i
did
not
believe
that
that
film
was
obscene
when
compared
with
other
films
which
have
been
held
not
be
obscene.
mr.
chief
justice
i
request
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
yes,
your
honor.
as
to
the
expertise
of
the
sheriff
of
pulaski
county,
in
this
case,
if
a
comparison
is
made
of
the
sheriff's
reading
of
the
roth
definition
of
obscenity
which
he
copied
from
the
kentucky
statute
is
shown
on
page
17
of
the
appendix.
a
comparison
of
that
what
statute
actually
says
as
shown
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief
preferably
illustrates
that
the
sheriff
did
not
even
read
the
definition
of
obscenity
much
less
comprehend
it.
(inaudible)
to
the
average
person
applying
to
a
temporary
standard
when
the
statute
says
applying
contemporary
community
standards.
now
we
make
the
point
that
the
petitioner
also
contends
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
in
this
case.
the
prosecution
would
distinguish
the
books
and
marcus
cases
by
saying
that
in
those
cases
large
quantities
of
books
were
seized
while
in
this
case
only
one
copy
of
a
film
was
seized.
we
say
that
this
distinction
is
not
likely
significant
because
a
single
film
is
equal
when
disseminated
in
parts
to
a
large
quantity
of
books,
it's
equal
to
the
entire
stock
of
the
newsdealer
or
to
the
entire
inventory
of
the
the
newsdealer.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
the
restrained
imposed
upon
us
exhibition
deprives
many
people
of
an
opportunity
to
see
the
film,
to
receive
the
expression
and
the
ideas
contained
therein.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
again,
your
honor,
the
determination
is
so
sensitive
under
the
roth
test
that
there
is
no
other
way,
to
determine
obscenity.
i
say
that
it
can't
be
delegated
to
local
police
officers
in
the
field
and
it's
not
any
answer
to
say
that
just
one
copy
of
the
film
was
seized.
the
effect
of
the
seizure,
of
one
seizure
and
one
prosecution
can
perceive
ripple
effect
from
its
source
and
we
say
that
the
first
amendment
affords
national
protection
at
a
scope
that
extends
beyond
kentucky.
another
point
made
with
the
prosecution
is
they
apprehend
and
if
an
adversary
hearing
is
afforded
that
the
film
might
be
shift
out
of
the
jurisdiction,
edited
or
altered
before
the
adversary
hearing
to
be
concluded
and
they
say
that
the
adversary
hearing
just
won't
work.
we
might
point
out
that
these
figures
can
be
made
by
protective
orders
of
the
magistrate,
subject
to
the
sanction
of
contempt.
i'll
give
example,
in
texas
the
legislature
has
expressly
authorized
protective
orders
to
prevent
a
film
from
moving
from
the
jurisdiction
or
alteration
and
a
knowing
violation
of
these
orders
is
made
a
separate
offense.
and
courts
have
consistently
indicated
that
compact
designed
to
subvert
or
bypass
administration
of
justice
will
not
be
permitted
merely
because
obscenity
litigation
may
involve
the
sensitive
procedural
tools
of
the
first
amendment.
the
report
of
the
president's
commission
on
obscenity
and
points
–
arbitrarily
points
out
that
legislation
can
be
drafted
to
require
an
exhibitor
or
distributor
to
make
a
film
available
for
judicial
hearing
by
permitting
it's
exhibition
pending
that
hearing.
the
adoption
of
such
legislation
consists
of
a
local
practice
would
appear
warranted
and
jurisdiction
to
which
it
may
continue
to
seek
to
prosecute
film
exhibitors
for
adults,
contrary
to
the
commission's
recommendation.
the
commission
proposed
a
model
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
statute.
it
provides
whenever
material
is
being
disseminated
in
violation
of
this
obscenity
laws,
the
state
may
bring
several
action
against
the
disseminators
in
order
to
obtain
a
declaration
that
the
dissemination
was
prohibited.
we
say
that
the
requirement
of
an
adversary
hearing
will
work.
application
to
be
made
for
preliminary
injunction
after
notice
to
the
adverse
party
an
opportunity
for
him
to
be
heard.
the
court
could
grant
an
ex
parte
restraining
order
to
control
any
real
threat
of
editing.
the
order
can
direct
the
exhibitor
to
keep
and
maintain
the
film
within
the
jurisdiction
and
keep
it
in
intact
and
order
--
and
enjoin
the
exhibitor
from
altering
any
part
of
it
and
it
can
punish
violations
of
those
orders
by
contempt.
there
is
nothing
we
say
to
prevent
diligent
state
prosecutor
from
executing
adversary
proceedings
before
judicial
officer
through
notice
to
the
distributor
and
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
directed
to
advert
the
(inaudible)
challenged
publication
and
following
judicial
determination
of
obscenity
the
state
authorities
may
seize
and
prosecute
if
the
publications
and
materials
are
put
on
sale
and
this
is
very
clear
where
a
state
procedure
is
(inaudible).
the
prosecution
contends
that
it
is
significant
that
the
petitioner
did
not
move
or
return
of
the
film,
so
that
he
might
continue
to
show
it,
at
the
theater
and
we
did
not
think
this
is
significant.
clearly
the
prosecution
must
proceed
about
the
injunctive
process
or
in
some
combination
of
manner
which
will
afford
an
opportunity
for
the
prior
adversary
hearing.
it's
not
up
to
the
defendant
to
seek
return
of
the
film.
at
the
trial
court
hearing
it
sustained
his
motion
to
suppress
return
of
the
film
necessarily
would
violate.
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
show
the
(inaudible)
to
keep
it
and
return
of
the
film
in
any
event
is
not
an
adequate
remedy
because
it,
there
is
not
the
restrain
which
is
already
occurred
up
until
the
time
the
film
is
ordered
to
return.
the
quantity
of
books
case
i
believe
makes
it
clear
that
the
adversary
hearing
must
precede
seizure
in
order
to
protect
the
right
to
circulate
non-obscene
material
and
again
the
prosecution's
argument
has
not
taken
into
account
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights
to
be
free
from

may

the
single
issue
in
this
case
arises
out
of
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
in
the
circuit
court
of
pulaski
county,
kentucky
following
a
jury
trial
for
violating
kentucky's
obscenity
statute
which
is
kentucky
revised
statute,
chapter
436,
section
101.
petitioner
was
convicted
under
subsection
(2)
of
that
statue
which
may
be
found
on
pages
3
and
4
of
the
brief
for
petitioner.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
simple
and
for
the
most
part
undisputed.
on
the
9
--
september
the
29th,
1970,
the
sheriff
of
pulaski
county,
kentucky
purchased
a
ticket
to
highway
27
drive-in
theater
which
was
managed
by
the
petitioner.
the
sheriff
viewed
the
entire
film
being
exhibited
that
evening
which
was
entitled
cindy
and
donna.
immediately
following
the
exhibition
of
the
film,
the
sheriff
proceeded
to
the
projection
booth
of
the
theater
and
there
arrested
the
petitioner
upon
a
charge
of
violating
the
statue
and
seized
the
film.
at
the
time
the
arrest
was
made
and
the
film
was
seized,
there
was
no
warrant
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
issued
by
any
magistrate.
no
magistrate
had
viewed
the
film.
there
were
no
descriptive
affidavits
before,
for
instance,
any
magistrate.
immediately
there
was
no
hearing
of
any
kind
before
a
judicial
officer,
advisory
or
ex
parte
to
focus
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
the
sheriff
upon
viewing
the
film,
ex
parte
and
on
his
own
made
a
determination
that
the
film
was
obscene
and
such
ex
parte
determination
on
his
part
led
to
the
arrest
and
seizure
of
the
film.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
no,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
we,
we
would
ask
a
meaningful
opportunity
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
to
be
heard
to
counter
the
judgment
of
the
local
law
enforcement
officer,
that
the
film
was
obscene.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
i
think
the
issue
would
be
probable
obscenity
of
the
film.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
your
honor,
we
believe
the
issue
of
obscenity
is
so
sensitive
and
this
court
had
said
that
it's
separated
by
only
a
down
and
uncertain
line
and
that
separation
calls
for
the
use
of
sensitive
tools.
we
believe
that
it
is
required
here.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
yes.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
my
reading
of
the
marcus
and
books
case
convinces
me
that
adversary
hearing
pertains
to
probable
obscenity.
you
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
further
proceeding
if
it
were
determined
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
to
believe
the
film
to
be
obscene.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
there
would
be
no
need
for
further
trial
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
no,
your
honor
at
the
time.
on
the
day
following
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
and
the
seizure
of
this
film,
the
sheriff
took
it
to
the
grand
jury
of
pulaski
county
and
an
indictment
was
returned
charging
the
petitioner
with
the
offense
for
which
he
was
convicted.
the
petitioner
three
days
later
pleaded
not
guilty
and
the
case
was
set
for
trail
on
the
20th
of
october.
on
the
12th
of
october
the
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
this
film
as
evidence
and
to
dismiss
the
indictment
contending
as
he
does
here
today,
that
the
film
was
illegally
seized
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law
because
there
had
been
no
adversary
hearing
prior
to
the
seizure.
the
motion
to
suppress
and
dismiss
the
indictment
was
overruled
and
petitioner's
trial
began.
now
petitioner
at
the
trial
again
objected
to
admission
of
the
film
in
evidence
and
renewed
his
motion
to
suppress.
the
trial
court
overruled.
the
issue
was
again
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
and
that
court
affirmed
the
conviction
on
june
the
25th
1971
and
denied
a
re-hearing.
at
no
point,
prior
to
the
seizure
that
the
petitioner
or
anyone
in
his
behalf
had
an
opportunity
to
contest
the
judgment
of
the
sheriff
that
this
film
was
obscene.
so
that's
presented
the
single
issue
of
whether
in
the
absence
of
a
prior
adversary
hearing,
the
seizure
incident
to
arrest
of
allegedly
obscene
material
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
maintain
that,
that
it
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
closing
argument
and
we
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
closing
argument
will
disclose
to
this
court
that
was
trial
strategy
and
even,
even
if
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
a
concession
made
in
the
closing
argument,
we
nevertheless
maintain
that
all
material
regardless
of
its
eventual
characterization
as
obscene
or
non-obscene
is
clothed
with
the
same
procedural
safeguards
until
there
has
been
an
adversary
hearing.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
we
did
not
concede
the
obscenity
and
--
but
for
the
protection
of
material
that
is
not
obscene
whether
this
material
will
turn
out
to
be
obscene
or
not
or
whether
it
was
conceded
that
any
time
during
the
trial,
we
don't
think
it
is
important.
we
think
it
was
clothed
with
the
same
procedural
safeguards
as
non-obscene
material
until
the
determination
in
the
adversary
hearing.
petitioner
and
his
contention
here
relies
on
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
marcus
versus
search
warrant
properly,
a
quantity
of
books
versus
kansas,
and
lee
art
theatre
versus
virginia.
and
the
gist
again
of
petitioner's
contention
is
that
discretion
to
seize
allegedly
obscene
material
cannot
be
confided
to
law
enforcement
officers
without
some
safeguards
for
the
protection
of
non-obscene
material.
and
a
seizure
without
a
warrant
such
as
occurred
in
this
case,
there
were
no
safeguards
at
all
to
prevent
this
question
of
not
obscene
film
which
are
protected
by
the
constitution.
and
because
first
amendment
rights
are
involved
here
the
sheriff
of
pulaski
county,
kentucky
have
no
discretion
to
say
that
a
crime
have
been
committed
in
his
presence.
a
state
is
not
free,
this
court
said
in
marcus
to
adopt
whatever
procedures
it
pleases
for
dealing
with
obscenity
without
regard
to
the
possible
consequences
for
constitutionally
protected
speech.
and
the
line
between
speech
unconditionally
guaranteed
and
speech
which
may
legitimately
be
punished
is
finely
drawn,
it's
dim
and
uncertain
and
separation
of
the
legitimate
for
the
illegitimate,
calls
for
the
use
of
sensitive
tool.
so
here
we
have
an
ex
parte
non-judicial
determination
of
probable
obscenity
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
the
thief.
the
sheriff
acted
as
judge
and
in
a
sense
no
where
was
there
any
procedure
designed
to
focus
searching
--
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
this
film
had
shown
for
two
nights
prior
to
the
seizure.
there
was
no
emergency
or
danger
to
the
community
which
compelled
the
seizure
without
at
least
a
warrant
or
some
prior
judicial
scrutiny.
the
test
of
obscenity
as
laid
down
of
this
court
in
the
roth
case
as
so
apply
then
it
must
be
made
judicial.
to
permit
unbridled
discretion
on
law
enforcement
officers
to
apply
such
tests
amounts
to
a
vague
understanding
of
this
delegation
of
judicial
power.
we
believe
that
marcus
and
books
required
the
court
of
law
to
make
the
determination
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
the
film
obscene
and
this
only
after
a
meaning
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
police
officers
in
the
field
are
not
equipped
to
apply
the
test
and
separate
the
legitimate
from
the
illegitimate.
while
police
officers
may
be
property
trained
experts
in
the
detection
and
proper
identification
of
the
usual
paraphernalia
of
crime,
they
do
not
enjoy
such
a
status
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
literature
and
movies.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
that's
true
in
most
cases
mr.
chief
justice
but
not
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
i
don't
believe
that
a
police
officer
in
the
field
is
capable
of
applying
roth
test
with
respect
to
obscenity.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
but
once
he
makes
his
determination
and
seizes
the
film
then
there
is
the
danger
that
non-obscene
material
has
been
restrained.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe
that
any
requirement
that
a
theater
owner
–
he
–
two
films
on
him
is
too
burdensome
and
are
made
--
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
i
still
feel
that
the
petitioner's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
involved
and
that
even
the
seizure
of
one
film
imposes
a
restraint,
whether
it's
one
film
or
dozen
films.
that
particular
film
was
restrained.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
my
answer
would
be
the
same
mr.
justice
powell
because
we
believe
the
first
amendment
makes
no
reference
to
quantity
that
it
affords
one
book,
one
film,
the
same
protection.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
we
maintain
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
we
did
not
concede
the
obscenity
of
the
film
that
this
was
trial
strategy.
the
jury
which
heard
this
--
which
saw
this
film
and
came
back
to
the
courtroom
was
ready
to,
if
protected
law
has
permitted
it
would
have
hung
this
man.
they
would
have
given
him
the
death
penalty.
we
found
that
there
was
no
chance
of
persuading
this
jury
that
the
film
was
not
obscene.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
is
much
difference
in
that
the
jury
had
to
make
two
findings.
first
was,
is
the
film
obscene
and
second
was
is
defendant
guilty
of
showing
an
obscene
film
and
we
concentrated
only
second
finding,
conviction
of
the
defendant
in
regard.
but
now
we
didn't
have
much
chance
to
convince
that
jury
that
this
film
wasn't
obscene.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
no
it
doesn't,
mr.
justice
marshall
because
--
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
mr.
justice
marshall
i
did
not
believe
that
that
film
was
obscene
when
compared
with
other
films
which
have
been
held
not
be
obscene.
mr.
chief
justice
i
request
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
yes,
your
honor.
as
to
the
expertise
of
the
sheriff
of
pulaski
county,
in
this
case,
if
a
comparison
is
made
of
the
sheriff's
reading
of
the
roth
definition
of
obscenity
which
he
copied
from
the
kentucky
statute
is
shown
on
page
17
of
the
appendix.
a
comparison
of
that
what
statute
actually
says
as
shown
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief
preferably
illustrates
that
the
sheriff
did
not
even
read
the
definition
of
obscenity
much
less
comprehend
it.
(inaudible)
to
the
average
person
applying
to
a
temporary
standard
when
the
statute
says
applying
contemporary
community
standards.
now
we
make
the
point
that
the
petitioner
also
contends
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
in
this
case.
the
prosecution
would
distinguish
the
books
and
marcus
cases
by
saying
that
in
those
cases
large
quantities
of
books
were
seized
while
in
this
case
only
one
copy
of
a
film
was
seized.
we
say
that
this
distinction
is
not
likely
significant
because
a
single
film
is
equal
when
disseminated
in
parts
to
a
large
quantity
of
books,
it's
equal
to
the
entire
stock
of
the
newsdealer
or
to
the
entire
inventory
of
the
the
newsdealer.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
the
restrained
imposed
upon
us
exhibition
deprives
many
people
of
an
opportunity
to
see
the
film,
to
receive
the
expression
and
the
ideas
contained
therein.
mr.
phillip
k.
wicker
again,
your
honor,
the
determination
is
so
sensitive
under
the
roth
test
that
there
is
no
other
way,
to
determine
obscenity.
i
say
that
it
can't
be
delegated
to
local
police
officers
in
the
field
and
it's
not
any
answer
to
say
that
just
one
copy
of
the
film
was
seized.
the
effect
of
the
seizure,
of
one
seizure
and
one
prosecution
can
perceive
ripple
effect
from
its
source
and
we
say
that
the
first
amendment
affords
national
protection
at
a
scope
that
extends
beyond
kentucky.
another
point
made
with
the
prosecution
is
they
apprehend
and
if
an
adversary
hearing
is
afforded
that
the
film
might
be
shift
out
of
the
jurisdiction,
edited
or
altered
before
the
adversary
hearing
to
be
concluded
and
they
say
that
the
adversary
hearing
just
won't
work.
we
might
point
out
that
these
figures
can
be
made
by
protective
orders
of
the
magistrate,
subject
to
the
sanction
of
contempt.
i'll
give
example,
in
texas
the
legislature
has
expressly
authorized
protective
orders
to
prevent
a
film
from
moving
from
the
jurisdiction
or
alteration
and
a
knowing
violation
of
these
orders
is
made
a
separate
offense.
and
courts
have
consistently
indicated
that
compact
designed
to
subvert
or
bypass
administration
of
justice
will
not
be
permitted
merely
because
obscenity
litigation
may
involve
the
sensitive
procedural
tools
of
the
first
amendment.
the
report
of
the
president's
commission
on
obscenity
and
points
–
arbitrarily
points
out
that
legislation
can
be
drafted
to
require
an
exhibitor
or
distributor
to
make
a
film
available
for
judicial
hearing
by
permitting
it's
exhibition
pending
that
hearing.
the
adoption
of
such
legislation
consists
of
a
local
practice
would
appear
warranted
and
jurisdiction
to
which
it
may
continue
to
seek
to
prosecute
film
exhibitors
for
adults,
contrary
to
the
commission's
recommendation.
the
commission
proposed
a
model
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
statute.
it
provides
whenever
material
is
being
disseminated
in
violation
of
this
obscenity
laws,
the
state
may
bring
several
action
against
the
disseminators
in
order
to
obtain
a
declaration
that
the
dissemination
was
prohibited.
we
say
that
the
requirement
of
an
adversary
hearing
will
work.
application
to
be
made
for
preliminary
injunction
after
notice
to
the
adverse
party
an
opportunity
for
him
to
be
heard.
the
court
could
grant
an
ex
parte
restraining
order
to
control
any
real
threat
of
editing.
the
order
can
direct
the
exhibitor
to
keep
and
maintain
the
film
within
the
jurisdiction
and
keep
it
in
intact
and
order
--
and
enjoin
the
exhibitor
from
altering
any
part
of
it
and
it
can
punish
violations
of
those
orders
by
contempt.
there
is
nothing
we
say
to
prevent
diligent
state
prosecutor
from
executing
adversary
proceedings
before
judicial
officer
through
notice
to
the
distributor
and
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
directed
to
advert
the
(inaudible)
challenged
publication
and
following
judicial
determination
of
obscenity
the
state
authorities
may
seize
and
prosecute
if
the
publications
and
materials
are
put
on
sale
and
this
is
very
clear
where
a
state
procedure
is
(inaudible).
the
prosecution
contends
that
it
is
significant
that
the
petitioner
did
not
move
or
return
of
the
film,
so
that
he
might
continue
to
show
it,
at
the
theater
and
we
did
not
think
this
is
significant.
clearly
the
prosecution
must
proceed
about
the
injunctive
process
or
in
some
combination
of
manner
which
will
afford
an
opportunity
for
the
prior
adversary
hearing.
it's
not
