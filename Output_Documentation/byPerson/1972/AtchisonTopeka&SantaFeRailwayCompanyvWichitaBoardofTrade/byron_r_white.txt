justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
what
if
the
district
court
had
held
the
findings
of
the
commission
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
set
them
aside?
then
on
the
--
could
it
have
enjoined
the
rates
under
arrow
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
only
--
that
the
only
--
that
the
only,
the
thing
was
suspend
the
rates
once
the
seven
months
is
expired,
is
a
finding
by
the
commission,
that
they
were
unjust
and
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
when
the
court
sets
aside
a
commission's
finding
that
they
are
just
and
reasonable?
and
a
court
sets
them
aside,
what
happens
to
the
rates?
could
the
commission
just
sit
there
and
lead
the
rates
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
until
and
unless
they
find
the
rates
unjust
and
unreasonable,
the
rates
stand
to
affect?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
court,
the
commission
can
just
the
bat
the
ball
back
and
forth
forever?
justice
byron
r.
white
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
the
commission
ever
do
it
if
it
didn't
agree
with
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
couldn't
enjoin
the
rates
--
enjoin
the
rates,
could
it
after
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
set
aside
the
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
couldn't
do
that
except
upon
of
finding
of
just
and
reasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
kind
of
take
it
that
the
courts
do
not
have
that
power
either,
do
they,
can
find
the
rates
unlawful?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
until
the
commission
finds
them
unlawful,
the
rates
stand
to
affect,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
about
my
question
to
mr.
pollock
where
the
commission
upholds
the
rates
as
lawful
and
they
are
in
effect
and
the
district
court
claims
that
the
judgment
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
it
sets
aside
the
commission's
findings
and
let
us
assumes
the
court
is
quite
right
that
the
commission's
finding
weren't
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
well,
further
reasons
were
invalid,
the
rates
still
stand
to
effect,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
these
are
automatically
followed
from
the
--
if
the
record
remains
the
same,
the
commission
must
then
automatically
enter
a
judgment
finding
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
a
district
court
order
a
commission
to
find
them
unlawful
unless
the
record
is
examined?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
the
court
itself
enter
a
refund
order
contingent
upon
finding
of
unlawfulness.
let's
suppose
that
when
the
seven
months
expire,
the
commission
does
not
enter
any
order
about
a
refund
in
the
event
of
finding
unlawfulness?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
cannot
find
the
rates
unjust
and
unreasonable
or
suspend
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
certainly
is
anticipated
that
the
commission
is
going
to
take
some
further
proceedings
in
the
meanwhile?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
think
so
it
would
–
we
set
aside
the
order
because
you
haven't
given
a
decent
enough
reasons.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
is
--
it's
not
been
held
that
rates
are
unjust
and
unreasonable,
don't
you
or
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
the
congress
provided
or
hasn't
that
the
rates
may
not
be
suspended
beyond
seven
months
until
there
is
a
finding
of
it
as
unjust
and
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
order
in
case
that
they
unjust
and
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
if
rates
in
effect
commission
finds
the
rates
just
and
reasonable,
the
commission
itself
could
suspend
the
rates
beyond
the
seven
months
pending
judicial
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
they
are
kind
of
just
and
reasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't,
even
though
a
court
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
i
know
but
that
still
leaves
the
rates
in
effect
that
under
the
seven
months
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if

what
if
the
district
court
had
held
the

of
the
commission
were

what

a

that
they
are
just

and
a

sets
them
aside,
what

to
the
