are
you
suggesting
there
are
no
other
alternatives
for
solving
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
that
is
obviously
an
easy
solution,
but
the
carrier
has
no
interest
in
the
quality
of
that
grain,
has
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
agree
with
i
think
it
was
mr.
pollock's
comment
that
the
railroads
lose
money
on
this
inspection
and
that
the
inspection
process
costs
more
than
the
enhanced
rate.
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.

we
are
just

chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
my
question
was
just
of
losing
money
on
the
inspection
process
standing
alone,
that
is
so
that
they
would
rather
eliminate
the
whole
process
and
from
their
point
of
view,
they
argue
that
they
would
be
better
off?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
paradox
though,
isn't
it?
it's
an
increase
in
total
rate
which
the
carrier
doesn't
want.

chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
just
relying
on
what
they
represent
in
the
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
read
the
arrow
case
as
taking
the
judges
out
of

making
men
as
in
the
barred

that
the
