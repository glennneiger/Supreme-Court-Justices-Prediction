mr.
earl
e.
pollock
may
it
please
the
court.
within
the
past
year,
this
is
the
third
case
to
come
before
the
court,
arising
out
of
efforts
to
release
the
critical
shortage
of
freight
cars
on
the
nation's
railroads.
the
other
two
cases
allegheny-ludlum
and
florida
east
coast
involve
rules
and
rates
intended
to
discourage
delay
in
returning
cars.
this
case
involves
railroad
charges
intended
to
discourage
the
in-transit
inspection
of
grain
and
in
that
way
reduce
the
wasteful
use
of
cars.
the
new
tariffs
were
published
by
the
railroads
almost
exactly
three
years
ago
to
become
effective
on
march
28,
1970,
but
before
the
effective
date,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
acting
under
section
15(7)
of
the
act
suspended
the
charges
for
the
maximum
seven
month
period
provided
by
the
statute.
the
suspension
was
voluntarily
extended
by
the
affected
railroads
for
an
additional
six
months.
the
charges
were
finally
put
into
effect
in
may
1971.
after
extensive
hearings,
the
commission
found
that
the
charges
were
just
and
reasonable
and
also
found
that
the
charges
would
make
a
substantial
contribution
to
the
improvement
of
the
national
freight
car
supply.
the
district
court,
the
court
below,
set
aside
the
commission's
order,
in
addition
without
any
request
by
the
plaintiffs
to
grant
such
relief,
without
any
discussion
of
its
authority
to
grant
such
relief,
without
any
finding
of
irreplaceable
injury,
and
indeed
without
any
injunction
findings
whatsoever.
the
district
court
suspended
the
charges
which
are
then
been
in
effect
for
over
a
year.
thereafter,
this
court
entered
and
ordered
which
stayed
the
judgment
below
and
which
permitted
the
rates
to
go
back
into
effect.
my
co-counsel,
mrs.
christian,
associate
general
counsel
of
the
commission
will
present
the
position
of
the
appellants
and
the
united
states
on
the
district
court's
suspension
of
the
charges,
while
my
argument
will
deal
with
the
district
court's
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
commission's
order.
these
tariffs
imposed
charges
for
interrupting
grain
shipments
for
the
purpose
of
in-transit
inspection.
this
service
involves
stopping
a
car
loaded
with
grain
while
it
is
already
en-route,
switching
the
car
to
a
separate
track
at
a
few
locations
in
the
country,
where
the
car
is
held
for
sampling
and
grading
of
the
contents,
waiting
for
disposition
orders
from
the
shipper
or
his
consignee
after
he
receives
the
results
of
the
inspection,
and
then
eventually
switching
the
car
back
into
the
regular
line-haul
movement.
the
car
delay
resulting
from
this
practice
amounts
on
the
average
to
more
than
three
days
for
each
and
every
inspection.
now
this
delay
can
readily
be
avoided
by
having
the
inspection,
if
an
inspection
is
desired,
made
either
at
the
point
of
origin
or
at
the
point
of
destination
after
delivery,
or
by
omitting
the
inspection
altogether
as
it's
frequently
done.
historically,
the
nation's
railroads
have
made
separate
charges
for
providing
in-transit
inspection
service,
but
in
the
western
district,
unlike
the
east
which
has
been
doing
this
since
1963,
these
charges
previously
applied,
although
with
a
number
of
various
substantial
exceptions,
only
to
the
second
and
subsequent
inspections
on
any
one
grain
shipment.
the
first
inspection
in
other
words,
was
in
the
western
district
provided
without
additional
charge.
this
extraordinary
practice
grew
out
of
a
legal
requirement
which
no
longer
exists.
until
five
years
ago,
the
inspection
of
interstate
grain
shipments
was
required
by
federal
law,
but
in
1968,
congress
repealed
this
requirement.
at
the
same
time,
the
congress
authorized
inspection
on
the
basis
of
so
called
submitted
samples.
the
result
of
these
changes
in
the
law
is
that
under
the
law
at
present,
any
shipping
point
in
the
country
can
also
be
an
inspection
point.
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
did
not
have
to
be
done
while
it
was
in
transit,
but
as
the
commission
pointed
out
because
of
prior
practice
and
because
of
convenience,
the
practice
of
in-transit
inspection
of
grain
continued.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
was
not
required
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
is
to
stimulate
the
grain
trade
so
as
to
depart
from
this
practice
in
the
light
of
the
commission's
findings
that
in-transit
inspection
is
by
no
means
essential.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
could
have
been
done
the
other
way
but
it
was
not.
the
court
below
found
with
respect
to
this
1968
repeal
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
congress
was
to
affect
an
increased
utilization
of
rail
cars.
nevertheless,
in-transit
inspections
continued
in
very
large
numbers
even
after
the
repeal,
amounting
in
1969
to
over
or
almost
half
a
million
inspections
in
just
the
western
district
alone.
now
faced
with
this
situation
and
an
increasingly
critical
car
shortage,
the
western
railroads
responded
by
publishing
the
tariffs
which
are
challenged
in
this
case.
these
tariffs
imposed
essentially
the
same
charge
for
the
first
in-transit
inspection
that
previously
applied
to
the
second
and
subsequent
inspections.
the
tariffs
of
course
apply
only
to
grain
shipments
which
are
inspected
while
in-transit.
there
is
no
charge
if
the
shipment
is
inspected
at
origin
or
at
destination
after
delivery
or
if
inspection
is
avoided
altogether.
and
before
the
commission,
the
railroads
even
expressed
the
hope
that
they
would
not
have
to
collect
one
single
cent
of
these
charges
because
the
purpose
was
to
avoid
the
inspections
and
not
to
raise
revenue.
the
commission
summarized
this
decision
of
holding
the
charges
in
four
chief
findings.
first
of
all,
the
commission
found
that
because
of
the
repeal
in
1968
and
because
of
other
evidence
in
record,
in-transit
inspection
is
no
longer
essential
to
the
orderly
marketing
of
grain.
the
commission
found
instead
that
this
service
was
entirely
optional
with
shippers
and
their
consignees,
and
that
the
basic
responsibility
of
the
railroads
with
respect
to
transportation
does
not
require
them
to
provide
this
service.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
primarily,
the
consignee
and
indeed
primarily
from
the
grain
exchanges
which
are
the
principal
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
indeed
there
is
a
considerable
economic
advantage
to
these
grain
exchanges
by
virtue
of
the
in-transit
inspection
of
grain,
since
if
the
shipment
is
made
to
a
particular
point
for
the
in-transit
inspection,
at
that
point
the
grain
merchants
in
that
particular
area
have
in
fact
a
captive
market
with
respect
to
that
grain
shipment.
the
grain
being
there,
it
then
becomes
exceedingly
difficult
for
reconsignment
of
that
grain
to
a
distant
market
or
to
a
market
which
would
require
a
back
call
on
the
transportation
and
indeed
this
is
the
--
it
is
this
kind
of
dislocation,
particularly
among
the
grain
dealers
and
the
grain
exchanges
which
has
brought
forth
the
principal
opposition
to
these
charges.
in
other
words,
the
commission
found
that
this
service
was
purely
an
accessorial
service,
it
was
a
special
service
and
it
was
quite
like
a
service,
for
example,
that
was
needed
for
delivery
of
the
goods.
second,
the
commission
sustained
the
reasonableness
of
the
combination
of
the
line-haul
rate
and
these
inspection
charges.
the
commission
pointed
out
that
under
the
terras,
the
aggregate
charges
could
never
exceed
the
maximum
reasonable
level
determined
by
the
commission
and
the
commission
reaffirm
the
vitality
of
the
maximum
level,
pointing
out
that
there
was
probably
no
segment
of
the
country's
railroad
freight
structure
that
had
been
reviewed
more
frequently
and
intimately
than
the
one
that
has
application
to
the
movement
of
grain.
third,
the
commission
found
that
the
inspection
charges
themselves,
are
just
and
reasonable
because
they
were
less
than
the
cost
of
the
service
to
the
railroads.
and
fourth,
the
commission
found
that
the
charges
would
materially
increase
car
utilization
and
that
elimination
of
in-transit
inspection
of
grain
would
increase
the
number
of
available
freight
cars
by
several
thousand
annually.
the
commission
retained
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
any
funds
derived
from
these
charges
should
be
used
to
upgrade
the
railroad
freight
car
fleets
and
for
this
purpose,
the
commission
ordered
the
railroads
to
file
periodic
reports
showing
just
what
was
the
actual
operation
of
these
charges.
these
reports
dramatically
confirm
the
effectiveness
of
these
charges
in
reducing
the
volume
of
in-transit
inspections.
they
also
serve
to
demonstrate,
as
the
commission
found,
the
purely
optional
elective
nature
of
the
in-transit
inspection
service.
the
report
show
that
the
frequency
of
such
inspections
before
the
charges
became
effective
was
nearly
two-and-a-half
times
higher
than
the
frequency
afterwards.
stated
otherwise,
there
is
already
been,
in
the
short
time
of
these
charges
have
been
an
effect,
a
60%
reduction
and
the
frequency
continues
to
decline
because
of
the
economic
incentive
which
these
charges
provide.
the
most
recent
report
shows
that
there
was
only
about
one
in-transit
inspection
for
every
five
grain
shipments.
the
commission's
findings
were
sustained
by
the
district
court
as
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
but
the
court
satisfied
the
commission's
order
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
commission
did
not
adequately
explain
what
the
court
viewed
as
a
departure
from
an
allegedly
long-established
commission
doctrine.
the
court
based
this
conclusion
not
on
the
commission's
findings,
but
instead
on
an
expressly
secondary
reasons
cited
by
the
commission
for
distinguishing
a
1969
decision
by
the
commission.
entirely,
on
this
very
slim
read,
just
four
sentences
taken
out
of
a
43-page
report,
four
sentences,
constituting
little
more
than
a
dictum,
the
court
below
held
that
the
commission
had
adopted
what
the
court
called
an
evidentiary
rule
which
is
discriminatory
per
se
and
that
the
commission
had
thereby
departed
from
its
prior
decisions
which
require
consideration
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
aggregate
charges
in
these
service
cases.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
said
absolutely
nothing,
your
honor.
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
court's
decision
concerning
arrow
or
its
authority
to
grant
that
relief.
the
only
thing
that
appears
in
the
opinion
is
that
in
the
very
last
sentence
of
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
douglas,
after
the
court
sets
aside
the
order,
it
adds
a
sentence
saying
that
the
charges
are
suspended
until
further
notice
and
permission
of
this
court.
there
is
no
reference
at
all
to
this
very
important
arrow
issue
which
my
colleague
mrs.
christian
will
be
dealing
with
in
greater
detail.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no
your
honor,
because
all
that
we
would
have
in
that
case
would
be
a
situation
where
the
commission
had
intervened
with
respect
to
carrier
made
rates
and
the
entire
seven
month
period
of
suspension
had
expired.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right,
that's
what
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
matter
would
then
go
back
to
the
commission
for
consideration
of
the
alleged
error
pointed
out
by
the
district
court.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
that
has
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
it
isn't
quite
like
that,
your
honor.
as
it
was
planned
out
in
the
arrow
decision
itself
and
as
mrs.
christian
will
deal
with
in
greater
detail.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
that's
quite
alright,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
answer
that
immediately,
that
is
the
congress
provided
two
very
specific
remedies
for
that
situation.
it
dealt
with
that
situation.
it
provided
number
one,
a
reparations
remedy
by
which
any
unjust
charges
can
be
collected
and
second
it
authorized
the
commission
to
institute
an
accounting
and
refund
order
whereby
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
would
be
again
within
the
matter
of
the
discretion
of
the
commission
to
grant
such
relief,
your
honor,
while
it
is
considering
whether
the
court's
order
is
appropriate.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
can
set
aside
the
rates.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
it
can
set
aside
the
rates.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
that's
right,
but
that's
exactly
the
structure
that
was
set
up
and
the
delicate
balance
which
was
established
by
congress
and
i
am
sure
mrs.
christian
will
spell
that
out
even
more
thoroughly.
i
find
that
my
time
is
up
and
i
am
sure
that
mrs.
christian
will
deal
further
with
that
issue.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
of
all
point
out
that
much
of
the
argument
made
by
the
appellees
here
bears
no
relationship
either
to
the
findings
made
by
the
commission
which
i
comment
to
your
honors,
or
to
the
proceeding
that
was
conducted
before
the
commission.
for
example,
mr.
sweeney's
principle
argument
here
concerning
the
necessity
of
a
cost
analysis
under
section
15
(a)
(2)
was
never
raised
before
the
commission
and
of
course,
under
this
court's
decision
in
tucker
and
in
other
cases
is
barred,
but
more
fundamentally,
the
appellee's
arguments
and
i
think
this
gets
perhaps
to
crux
of
it
failed
to
take
account
of
the
nature
of
the
rate
making
function
and
the
commission's
role
and
discretion
in
performing
that
function.
when
it
comes
to
carrier
made
rates
there
is
contrary
to
the
appellee's
suggestion
no
single
rate
which
is
reasonable.
there
is
instead
a
zone
of
reasonableness
and
this
zone
is
located
between
a
reasonable
maximum
and
a
reasonable
minimum,
and
the
carrier
is
free
under
repeated
decisions
of
this
court,
without
a
special
permission
from
the
commission
to
adjust
its
rates
as
well
as
those
rates
stay
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
and
do
not
violate
the
act.
now
what
could
the
commission
do
here.
on
the
basis
of
its
own
prior
decisions
and
its
particularized
attention
year
after
year
after
year,
decision
after
decision
after
decision,
the
commission
reaffirmed
the
vitality
of
the
current
maximum
reasonable
level
and
said
across
even
if
we
add,
even
if
we
were
to
add
these
inspection
charges
to
the
existing
line-haul
rates,
the
resulting
combination
would
still
not
exceed
the
zone
of
reasonableness.
further
more,
and
in
particular
relation
to
mr.
justice
white's
earlier
question,
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
under
the
statutory
scheme,
carrier
initiated
rates
are
valid
unless
set
aside
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
not
vice
versa.
in
other
words,
under
the
statutory
scheme,
a
carrier
need
not
get
permission
to
institute
rates,
instead
the
carrier
has
that
right.
congress
gave
the
carrier
that
right
subject
only
to
the
commission
power
to
suspend
the
rates
for
this
limited
period
of
seven
months
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
this
court
in
arrow
said
that
that
is
the
only
exception
made
by
congress
and
neither
the
commission
nor
courts
can
intervene
beyond
that.
with
respect
to
the
optional
nature
of
the
inspection,
mr.
sweeney
has
said
that
this
is
absolutely
essential
but
look
at
the
facts.
at
the
present
time,
only
one
inspection
is
made
for
every
five
shipments
certainly
indicating
that
it
is
not
essential.
further
more
in-transit
inspection
has
never
taken
place,
as
the
commission
pointed
out
on
page
15
of
the
appendix,
with
respect
to
all
large
traffic
carrying
grain,
all
truck
traffic
carrying
grain
and
now
80
%
of
the
shipments
go
without
--
by
rail,
go
without
any
in-transit
inspection.
it
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
necessity
and
the
commission
found
--
pages
56
and
pages
17
through
90
of
the
appendix
that
it
was
not
essential
and
certainly,
this
is
not
the
form
to
re-argue
the
nitty-gritty
of
rate
making
issues.
if
there
is
anything
which
is
committed
to
the
discretion
of
interstate
commerce
commission,
it
is
this
matter
of
determining
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
rate
under
established
principles.
it
is
also
instructive,
i
would
say
is
closing
that
although
both
appellees
now
argue
for
the
necessity
of
the
suspension
power
in
courts,
they
do
not
even
see
fit
to
request
such
relief
in
the
district
court.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
may
it
please
the
court.
within
the
past
year,
this
is
the
third
case
to
come
before
the
court,
arising
out
of
efforts
to
release
the
critical
shortage
of
freight
cars
on
the
nation's
railroads.
the
other
two
cases
allegheny-ludlum
and
florida
east
coast
involve
rules
and
rates
intended
to
discourage
delay
in
returning
cars.
this
case
involves
railroad
charges
intended
to
discourage
the
in-transit
inspection
of
grain
and
in
that
way
reduce
the
wasteful
use
of
cars.
the
new
tariffs
were
published
by
the
railroads
almost
exactly
three
years
ago
to
become
effective
on
march
28,
1970,
but
before
the
effective
date,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
acting
under
section
15(7)
of
the
act
suspended
the
charges
for
the
maximum
seven
month
period
provided
by
the
statute.
the
suspension
was
voluntarily
extended
by
the
affected
railroads
for
an
additional
six
months.
the
charges
were
finally
put
into
effect
in
may
1971.
after
extensive
hearings,
the
commission
found
that
the
charges
were
just
and
reasonable
and
also
found
that
the
charges
would
make
a
substantial
contribution
to
the
improvement
of
the
national
freight
car
supply.
the
district
court,
the
court
below,
set
aside
the
commission's
order,
in
addition
without
any
request
by
the
plaintiffs
to
grant
such
relief,
without
any
discussion
of
its
authority
to
grant
such
relief,
without
any
finding
of
irreplaceable
injury,
and
indeed
without
any
injunction
findings
whatsoever.
the
district
court
suspended
the
charges
which
are
then
been
in
effect
for
over
a
year.
thereafter,
this
court
entered
and
ordered
which
stayed
the
judgment
below
and
which
permitted
the
rates
to
go
back
into
effect.
my
co-counsel,
mrs.
christian,
associate
general
counsel
of
the
commission
will
present
the
position
of
the
appellants
and
the
united
states
on
the
district
court's
suspension
of
the
charges,
while
my
argument
will
deal
with
the
district
court's
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
commission's
order.
these
tariffs
imposed
charges
for
interrupting
grain
shipments
for
the
purpose
of
in-transit
inspection.
this
service
involves
stopping
a
car
loaded
with
grain
while
it
is
already
en-route,
switching
the
car
to
a
separate
track
at
a
few
locations
in
the
country,
where
the
car
is
held
for
sampling
and
grading
of
the
contents,
waiting
for
disposition
orders
from
the
shipper
or
his
consignee
after
he
receives
the
results
of
the
inspection,
and
then
eventually
switching
the
car
back
into
the
regular
line-haul
movement.
the
car
delay
resulting
from
this
practice
amounts
on
the
average
to
more
than
three
days
for
each
and
every
inspection.
now
this
delay
can
readily
be
avoided
by
having
the
inspection,
if
an
inspection
is
desired,
made
either
at
the
point
of
origin
or
at
the
point
of
destination
after
delivery,
or
by
omitting
the
inspection
altogether
as
it's
frequently
done.
historically,
the
nation's
railroads
have
made
separate
charges
for
providing
in-transit
inspection
service,
but
in
the
western
district,
unlike
the
east
which
has
been
doing
this
since
1963,
these
charges
previously
applied,
although
with
a
number
of
various
substantial
exceptions,
only
to
the
second
and
subsequent
inspections
on
any
one
grain
shipment.
the
first
inspection
in
other
words,
was
in
the
western
district
provided
without
additional
charge.
this
extraordinary
practice
grew
out
of
a
legal
requirement
which
no
longer
exists.
until
five
years
ago,
the
inspection
of
interstate
grain
shipments
was
required
by
federal
law,
but
in
1968,
congress
repealed
this
requirement.
at
the
same
time,
the
congress
authorized
inspection
on
the
basis
of
so
called
submitted
samples.
the
result
of
these
changes
in
the
law
is
that
under
the
law
at
present,
any
shipping
point
in
the
country
can
also
be
an
inspection
point.
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
did
not
have
to
be
done
while
it
was
in
transit,
but
as
the
commission
pointed
out
because
of
prior
practice
and
because
of
convenience,
the
practice
of
in-transit
inspection
of
grain
continued.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
was
not
required
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
is
to
stimulate
the
grain
trade
so
as
to
depart
from
this
practice
in
the
light
of
the
commission's
findings
that
in-transit
inspection
is
by
no
means
essential.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
could
have
been
done
the
other
way
but
it
was
not.
the
court
below
found
with
respect
to
this
1968
repeal
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
congress
was
to
affect
an
increased
utilization
of
rail
cars.
nevertheless,
in-transit
inspections
continued
in
very
large
numbers
even
after
the
repeal,
amounting
in
1969
to
over
or
almost
half
a
million
inspections
in
just
the
western
district
alone.
now
faced
with
this
situation
and
an
increasingly
critical
car
shortage,
the
western
railroads
responded
by
publishing
the
tariffs
which
are
challenged
in
this
case.
these
tariffs
imposed
essentially
the
same
charge
for
the
first
in-transit
inspection
that
previously
applied
to
the
second
and
subsequent
inspections.
the
tariffs
of
course
apply
only
to
grain
shipments
which
are
inspected
while
in-transit.
there
is
no
charge
if
the
shipment
is
inspected
at
origin
or
at
destination
after
delivery
or
if
inspection
is
avoided
altogether.
and
before
the
commission,
the
railroads
even
expressed
the
hope
that
they
would
not
have
to
collect
one
single
cent
of
these
charges
because
the
purpose
was
to
avoid
the
inspections
and
not
to
raise
revenue.
the
commission
summarized
this
decision
of
holding
the
charges
in
four
chief
findings.
first
of
all,
the
commission
found
that
because
of
the
repeal
in
1968
and
because
of
other
evidence
in
record,
in-transit
inspection
is
no
longer
essential
to
the
orderly
marketing
of
grain.
the
commission
found
instead
that
this
service
was
entirely
optional
with
shippers
and
their
consignees,
and
that
the
basic
responsibility
of
the
railroads
with
respect
to
transportation
does
not
require
them
to
provide
this
service.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
primarily,
the
consignee
and
indeed
primarily
from
the
grain
exchanges
which
are
the
principal
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
indeed
there
is
a
considerable
economic
advantage
to
these
grain
exchanges
by
virtue
of
the
in-transit
inspection
of
grain,
since
if
the
shipment
is
made
to
a
particular
point
for
the
in-transit
inspection,
at
that
point
the
grain
merchants
in
that
particular
area
have
in
fact
a
captive
market
with
respect
to
that
grain
shipment.
the
grain
being
there,
it
then
becomes
exceedingly
difficult
for
reconsignment
of
that
grain
to
a
distant
market
or
to
a
market
which
would
require
a
back
call
on
the
transportation
and
indeed
this
is
the
--
it
is
this
kind
of
dislocation,
particularly
among
the
grain
dealers
and
the
grain
exchanges
which
has
brought
forth
the
principal
opposition
to
these
charges.
in
other
words,
the
commission
found
that
this
service
was
purely
an
accessorial
service,
it
was
a
special
service
and
it
was
quite
like
a
service,
for
example,
that
was
needed
for
delivery
of
the
goods.
second,
the
commission
sustained
the
reasonableness
of
the
combination
of
the
line-haul
rate
and
these
inspection
charges.
the
commission
pointed
out
that
under
the
terras,
the
aggregate
charges
could
never
exceed
the
maximum
reasonable
level
determined
by
the
commission
and
the
commission
reaffirm
the
vitality
of
the
maximum
level,
pointing
out
that
there
was
probably
no
segment
of
the
country's
railroad
freight
structure
that
had
been
reviewed
more
frequently
and
intimately
than
the
one
that
has
application
to
the
movement
of
grain.
third,
the
commission
found
that
the
inspection
charges
themselves,
are
just
and
reasonable
because
they
were
less
than
the
cost
of
the
service
to
the
railroads.
and
fourth,
the
commission
found
that
the
charges
would
materially
increase
car
utilization
and
that
elimination
of
in-transit
inspection
of
grain
would
increase
the
number
of
available
freight
cars
by
several
thousand
annually.
the
commission
retained
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
any
funds
derived
from
these
charges
should
be
used
to
upgrade
the
railroad
freight
car
fleets
and
for
this
purpose,
the
commission
ordered
the
railroads
to
file
periodic
reports
showing
just
what
was
the
actual
operation
of
these
charges.
these
reports
dramatically
confirm
the
effectiveness
of
these
charges
in
reducing
the
volume
of
in-transit
inspections.
they
also
serve
to
demonstrate,
as
the
commission
found,
the
purely
optional
elective
nature
of
the
in-transit
inspection
service.
the
report
show
that
the
frequency
of
such
inspections
before
the
charges
became
effective
was
nearly
two-and-a-half
times
higher
than
the
frequency
afterwards.
stated
otherwise,
there
is
already
been,
in
the
short
time
of
these
charges
have
been
an
effect,
a
60%
reduction
and
the
frequency
continues
to
decline
because
of
the
economic
incentive
which
these
charges
provide.
the
most
recent
report
shows
that
there
was
only
about
one
in-transit
inspection
for
every
five
grain
shipments.
the
commission's
findings
were
sustained
by
the
district
court
as
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
but
the
court
satisfied
the
commission's
order
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
commission
did
not
adequately
explain
what
the
court
viewed
as
a
departure
from
an
allegedly
long-established
commission
doctrine.
the
court
based
this
conclusion
not
on
the
commission's
findings,
but
instead
on
an
expressly
secondary
reasons
cited
by
the
commission
for
distinguishing
a
1969
decision
by
the
commission.
entirely,
on
this
very
slim
read,
just
four
sentences
taken
out
of
a
43-page
report,
four
sentences,
constituting
little
more
than
a
dictum,
the
court
below
held
that
the
commission
had
adopted
what
the
court
called
an
evidentiary
rule
which
is
discriminatory
per
se
and
that
the
commission
had
thereby
departed
from
its
prior
decisions
which
require
consideration
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
aggregate
charges
in
these
service
cases.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
said
absolutely
nothing,
your
honor.
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
court's
decision
concerning
arrow
or
its
authority
to
grant
that
relief.
the
only
thing
that
appears
in
the
opinion
is
that
in
the
very
last
sentence
of
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
douglas,
after
the
court
sets
aside
the
order,
it
adds
a
sentence
saying
that
the
charges
are
suspended
until
further
notice
and
permission
of
this
court.
there
is
no
reference
at
all
to
this
very
important
arrow
issue
which
my
colleague
mrs.
christian
will
be
dealing
with
in
greater
detail.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no
your
honor,
because
all
that
we
would
have
in
that
case
would
be
a
situation
where
the
commission
had
intervened
with
respect
to
carrier
made
rates
and
the
entire
seven
month
period
of
suspension
had
expired.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right,
that's
what
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
matter
would
then
go
back
to
the
commission
for
consideration
of
the
alleged
error
pointed
out
by
the
district
court.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
that
has
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
it
isn't
quite
like
that,
your
honor.
as
it
was
planned
out
in
the
arrow
decision
itself
and
as
mrs.
christian
will
deal
with
in
greater
detail.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
that's
quite
alright,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
answer
that
immediately,
that
is
the
congress
provided
two
very
specific
remedies
for
that
situation.
it
dealt
with
that
situation.
it
provided
number
one,
a
reparations
remedy
by
which
any
unjust
charges
can
be
collected
and
second
it
authorized
the
commission
to
institute
an
accounting
and
refund
order
whereby
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
would
be
again
within
the
matter
of
the
discretion
of
the
commission
to
grant
such
relief,
your
honor,
while
it
is
considering
whether
the
court's
order
is
appropriate.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
can
set
aside
the
rates.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
it
can
set
aside
the
rates.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
that's
right,
but
that's
exactly
the
structure
that
was
set
up
and
the
delicate
balance
which
was
established
by
congress
and
i
am
sure
mrs.
christian
will
spell
that
out
even
more
thoroughly.
i
find
that
my
time
is
up
and
i
am
sure
that
mrs.
christian
will
deal
further
with
that
issue.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
of
all
point
out
that
much
of
the
argument
made
by
the
appellees
here
bears
no
relationship
either
to
the
findings
made
by
the
commission
which
i
comment
to
your
honors,
or
to
the
proceeding
that
was
conducted
before
the
commission.
for
example,
mr.
sweeney's
principle
argument
here
concerning
the
necessity
of
a
cost
analysis
under
section
15
(a)
(2)
was
never
raised
before
the
commission
and
of
course,
under
this
court's
decision
in
tucker
and
in
other
cases
is
barred,
but
more
fundamentally,
the
appellee's
arguments
and
i
think
this
gets
perhaps
to
crux
of
it
failed
to
take
account
of
the
nature
of
the
rate
making
function
and
the
commission's
role
and
discretion
in
performing
that
function.
when
it
comes
to
carrier
made
rates
there
is
contrary
to
the
appellee's
suggestion
no
single
rate
which
is
reasonable.
there
is
instead
a
zone
of
reasonableness
and
this
zone
is
located
between
a
reasonable
maximum
and
a
reasonable
minimum,
and
the
carrier
is
free
under
repeated
decisions
of
this
court,
without
a
special
permission
from
the
commission
to
adjust
its
rates
as
well
as
those
rates
stay
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
and
do
not
violate
the
act.
now
what
could
the
commission
do
here.
on
the
basis
of
its
own
prior
decisions
and
its
particularized
attention
year
after
year
after
year,
decision
after
decision
after
decision,
the
commission
reaffirmed
the
vitality
of
the
current
maximum
reasonable
level
and
said
across
even
if
we
add,
even
if
we
were
to
add
these
inspection
charges
to
the
existing
line-haul
rates,
the
resulting
combination
would
still
not
exceed
the
zone
of
reasonableness.
further
more,
and
in
particular
relation
to
mr.
justice
white's
earlier
question,
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
under
the
statutory
scheme,
carrier
initiated
rates
are
valid
unless
set
aside
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
not
vice
versa.
in
other
words,
under
the
statutory
scheme,
a
carrier
need
not
get
permission
to
institute
rates,
instead
the
carrier
has
that
right.
congress
gave
the
carrier
that
right
subject
only
to
the
commission
power
to
suspend
the
rates
for
this
limited
period
of
seven
months
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
this
court
in
arrow
said
that
that
is
the
only
exception
made
by
congress
and
neither
the
commission
nor
courts
can
intervene
beyond
that.
with
respect
to
the
optional
nature
of
the
inspection,
mr.
sweeney
has
said
that
this
is
absolutely
essential
but
look
at
the
facts.
at
the
present
time,
only
one
inspection
is
made
for
every
five
shipments
certainly
indicating
that
it
is
not
essential.
further
more
in-transit
inspection
has
never
taken
place,
as
the
commission
pointed
out
on
page
15
of
the
appendix,
with
respect
to
all
large
traffic
carrying
grain,
all
truck
traffic
carrying
grain
and
now
80
%
of
the
shipments
go
without
--
by
rail,
go
without
any
in-transit
inspection.
it
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
necessity
and
the
commission
found
--
pages
56
and
pages
17
through
90
of
the
appendix
that
it
was
not
essential
and
certainly,
this
is
not
the
form
to
re-argue
the
nitty-gritty
of
rate
making
issues.
if
there
is
anything
which
is
committed
to
the
discretion
of
interstate
commerce
commission,
it
is
this
matter
of
determining
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
rate
under
established
principles.
it
is
also
instructive,
i
would
