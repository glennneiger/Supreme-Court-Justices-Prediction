ms.
betty
jo
christian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
pollock
has
stated,
my
argument
this
morning
will
be
devoted
to
the
second
issue
presented
by
this
case.
that
is
even
assuming
that
the
district
court
correctly
reversed
the
commission's
decision
on
the
merits
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
did
it
nevertheless
act
beyond
the
scope
of
its
power
in
ordering
that
that
the
rates
themselves
be
suspended
unless
and
until
otherwise
ordered
by
the
court.
on
this
issue,
i
am
speaking
on
behalf
of
both
the
united
states
and
the
commission.
it
is
our
position
that
the
order
of
the
court
was
beyond
the
scope
of
its
powers.
mr.
pollock
has
already
stated
the
facts
related
to
the
suspension
issue
and
i
will
not
repeat
them
in
any
detail.
briefly
these
rates
went
into
effect
on
may
4,
1971,
and
they
remained
in
effect
until
the
commission
had
issued
its
original
decision
and
during
the
entire
pendency
of
this
judicial
review
proceeding.
it
was
after
a
year
later,
in
may
of
1971
–1972,
the
district
court
issued
its
opinion,
reversing
the
commission's
decision
and
setting
aside
the
rates.
it
is
this
portion
of
the
order,
that
we
believe
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
court's
power.
the
solution
of
this
issue
turns
on
section
15(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
1963
in
arrow
transportation
company
against
southern
railway.
under
section
15,
the
right
to
initiate
changes
in
their
rates
is
essentially
a
matter
for
the
managerial
discretion
of
the
carriers.
the
commission
is
empowered
to
declare
the
rates
unlawful
only
after
full
investigation.
the
only
other
limit
upon
the
carrier's
right
to
initiate
changes
in
their
rates
is
the
provision
of
section
15(7)
which
authorizes
the
commission
in
its
discretion
to
suspend
the
rates
for
a
maximum
period
of
seven
months.
the
statute
explicitly
provides
that
if
the
proceeding
has
not
been
completed
at
the
end
of
the
seven
month
period,
the
rates
“shall
go
into
effect.”
in
the
arrow
case,
this
court
was
faced
with
a
question
of
whether
a
district
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
itself
suspend
or
enjoin
the
rates
after
the
seventh
month
period
had
expired,
but
before
the
commission
had
issued
its
original
decision
in
the
case.
this
court
held
that
it
could
not
do
so.
it
is
stated
at
page
667
of
its
opinion
that
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
section
15(7)
was
to
vest
in
the
commission,
the
sole
and
exclusive
power
to
suspend
and
to
withdraw
from
the
judiciary
any
pre-existing
power
to
grant
injunctive
relief.
the
only
difference
between
arrow
and
this
case
is
the
stage
at
which
the
court
has
employed
a
judicial
suspension.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
sufficient
difference
toward
a
different
result
.in
other
words,
we
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
arrow
applies
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
basic
congressional
policy
of
section
15(7)
as
confirmed
in
arrow
is
to
allocate
between
the
shippers
and
carriers,
the
risks
and
versions
that
are
necessarily
associated
with
any
proposed
rate
change.
inevitably,
a
carrier
proposing
a
change
in
its
rates
wishes
to
implement
that
proposal
immediately,
while
the
shippers
on
the
other
hand
would
prefer
to
delay
it
until
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
has
been
finally
determined.
the
policy
of
congress
as
adopted
in
section
15(7)
was
essentially
a
compromise.
it
provided
that
during
the
first
seven
months,
the
risks
and
the
burdens
of
a
proposed
rate
change
should
be
placed
entirely
on
the
carriers.
that
is,
if
the
commission
chooses
to
suspend,
the
carrier
cannot
implement
its
rate
change
and
if
the
rates
are
ultimately
found
to
be
lawful,
the
carrier
has
no
remedy,
it
can
never
recover
the
lost
remedies
or
the
other
lost
benefits
of
that
seven
month
period.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
yes
sir.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
on
footnote
22,
your
honor,
this
court
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
reflecting
in
anyway
upon
decisions
recognizing
a
limited
power
of
the
courts
to
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
judicial
review.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
is
not
this
case.
to
begin
with,
the
--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
what
was
on
review
was
a
final
agency
action,
your
honor,
but
this
footnote
does
not
apply
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
not
issued
pending
judicial
review,
it
was
issued
at
the
conclusion
of
the
review
proceeding,
pending
reconsideration
of
the
case
by
the
agency.
secondly,
the
suspension
order
entered
here
by
the
court
did
not
preserve
the
status
quo.
these
rates
have
been
in
effect
for
over
a
year.
the
effect
of
the
court's
order
was
to
change
the
status
quo.
so
the
suggestion
of
a
limited
power
to
maintain
the
status
quo
pending
judicial
review
simply
is
not
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
careful
congressional
balancing
of
the
risks
and
burdens
of
suspension
which
this
court
held
in
arrow,
congress
intended
to
place
on
the
carrier
for
the
first
seven
months
and
upon
the
shippers
thereafter,
subject
to
the
protection
of
a
possible
accounting
and
refund
provision
of
a
recollection
suit
applies
equally
when
the
case
is
pending
before
the
commission
on
remand,
as
when
it
was
pending
before
the
commission
in
the
first
instance.
in
neither
event
has
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
than
finally
determined.
and
we
believe
that
the
congressional
policy
is
that
once
the
seventh
month
period
has
expired,
the
carriers
are
entitled
to
place
their
rates
into
effect
and
to
keep
them
in
effect
unless
and
until
the
rates
are
finally
adjudged
unlawful.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
this
is
exactly
the
point
i
was
coming
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case
--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
yes
your
honor,
it
is
solely
a
question
of
substantial
evidence.
it
would
be
up
to
the
agency
as
to
whether
to
decide
the
case
on
the
present
record
in
which
case
they
would
be
obliged
to
summarily
find
that
the
rates
have
not
been
shown
just
and
reasonable,
and
to
order
a
--
or
to
order
(voice
overlap)
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
would
not
say
automatically,
your
honor.
certainly
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
a
court
opinion
makes
it
clear
that
under
the
legal
standards
established
by
the
court,
the
rates
cannot
possibly
be
justified.
in
that
situation,
the
commission
would
have
no
alternative,
but
to
immediately
enter
it
an
order.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
that
the
court
could
not
order
them
to
find
the
rates
unlawful,
but
certainly
its
opinion
could
be
written
in
such
a
way
that
under
the
court's
legal
standards,
the
commission
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
find
them
unlawful.
in
that
situation,
the
commission
could
simply
enter
an
order
finding
an
accordance
with
the
legal
standards
established
by
the
court
that
the
rates
have
not
been
shown
to
be
just
unreasonable
and
ordering
them
canceled.
if
it
was
strictly
a
question
of
substantial
evidence
which
might
be
supplemented
by
further
evidence,
then
there
would
be
a
matter
for
the
discretion
for
the
commission
as
to
whether
to
permit
the
carriers
to
reopen
the
record
to
offer
further
evidence.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
certainly,
in
connection
with
an
appeal
of
the
agency's
final
decision
to
court,
the
courts
and
the
agency
have
assumed
that
the
courts
have
the
power
to
issue
an
accounting
and
refund
order.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
issued
an
accounting
and
refund
requirement
at
the
time
that
it
granted
a
stay
of
the
lower
court's
judgment
in
this
case.
we
have
always
assumed
that
the
court
does
have
that
power.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
exactly,
your
honor.
it
is
other
equitable
powers
to
impose
conditions
for
the
protection
of
the
shipments
such
as
an
accounting
and
refund
provisions
are
not
affected
in
anyway.
in
addition
to
the
congressional
policy
which
i
have
mentioned
that
the
carriers
be
permitted
to
put
their
rates
into
effect
after
seven
months
and
keep
them
in
effect
unless
and
until
they
are
found
unlawful,
we
believe
the
arrow
decision
cited
two
additional
policy
reasons
for
denying
the
court's
power
of
judicial
suspension
which
we
believe
are
equally
applicable
when
the
case
is
pending
before
the
commission
on
remand
as
when
it
was
pending
in
the
first
instance.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
exercise
of
a
judicial
suspension
power
would
interfere
with
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
agency
and
as
i
have
just
pointed
out
in
answering
mr.
justice
white's
questions,
the
agency
continues
to
have
primary
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
specific
rates
even
though
an
error
of
law
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
courts
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
commission.
the
actual
determination
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
is
still
for
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
and
the
same
nexus
that
this
court
found
in
arrow
between
primary
jurisdiction
and
the
suspension
power
applies
here
as
in
the
situation
that
existed
in
arrow.
secondly
this
court
pointed
out
in
arrow
that
if
the
courts
were
permitted
to
suspend,
the
result
might
be
different
results
to
different
shippers.
the
same
situation
could
occur
if
the
judicial
suspension
were
permitted
in
connection
with
a
remand
because
as
this
court
is
aware,
any
number
of
suits
can
be
brought
to
set
aside
the
same
commission
order
in
district
courts
all
over
the
country.
if
those
courts
should
reach
different
results,
one
sustaining
and
the
other
reversing
the
commission
and
if
the
reversing
court
were
permitted
to
exercise
a
suspension
power,
then
you
would
have
the
same
type
of
different
results
to
different
shippers
that
this
court
was
concerned
within
arrow.
thank
you.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
pollock
has
stated,
my
argument
this
morning
will
be
devoted
to
the
second
issue
presented
by
this
case.
that
is
even
assuming
that
the
district
court
correctly
reversed
the
commission's
decision
on
the
merits
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
did
it
nevertheless
act
beyond
the
scope
of
its
power
in
ordering
that
that
the
rates
themselves
be
suspended
unless
and
until
otherwise
ordered
by
the
court.
on
this
issue,
i
am
speaking
on
behalf
of
both
the
united
states
and
the
commission.
it
is
our
position
that
the
order
of
the
court
was
beyond
the
scope
of
its
powers.
mr.
pollock
has
already
stated
the
facts
related
to
the
suspension
issue
and
i
will
not
repeat
them
in
any
detail.
briefly
these
rates
went
into
effect
on
may
4,
1971,
and
they
remained
in
effect
until
the
commission
had
issued
its
original
decision
and
during
the
entire
pendency
of
this
judicial
review
proceeding.
it
was
after
a
year
later,
in
may
of
1971
–1972,
the
district
court
issued
its
opinion,
reversing
the
commission's
decision
and
setting
aside
the
rates.
it
is
this
portion
of
the
order,
that
we
believe
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
court's
power.
the
solution
of
this
issue
turns
on
section
15(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
1963
in
arrow
transportation
company
against
southern
railway.
under
section
15,
the
right
to
initiate
changes
in
their
rates
is
essentially
a
matter
for
the
managerial
discretion
of
the
carriers.
the
commission
is
empowered
to
declare
the
rates
unlawful
only
after
full
investigation.
the
only
other
limit
upon
the
carrier's
right
to
initiate
changes
in
their
rates
is
the
provision
of
section
15(7)
which
authorizes
the
commission
in
its
discretion
to
suspend
the
rates
for
a
maximum
period
of
seven
months.
the
statute
explicitly
provides
that
if
the
proceeding
has
not
been
completed
at
the
end
of
the
seven
month
period,
the
rates
“shall
go
into
effect.”
in
the
arrow
case,
this
court
was
faced
with
a
question
of
whether
a
district
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
itself
suspend
or
enjoin
the
rates
after
the
seventh
month
period
had
expired,
but
before
the
commission
had
issued
its
original
decision
in
the
case.
this
court
held
that
it
could
not
do
so.
it
is
stated
at
page
667
of
its
opinion
that
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
section
15(7)
was
to
vest
in
the
commission,
the
sole
and
exclusive
power
to
suspend
and
to
withdraw
from
the
judiciary
any
pre-existing
power
to
grant
injunctive
relief.
the
only
difference
between
arrow
and
this
case
is
the
stage
at
which
the
court
has
employed
a
judicial
suspension.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
sufficient
difference
toward
a
different
result
.in
other
words,
we
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
arrow
applies
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
basic
congressional
policy
of
section
15(7)
as
confirmed
in
arrow
is
to
allocate
between
the
shippers
and
carriers,
the
risks
and
versions
that
are
necessarily
associated
with
any
proposed
rate
change.
inevitably,
a
carrier
proposing
a
change
in
its
rates
wishes
to
implement
that
proposal
immediately,
while
the
shippers
on
the
other
hand
would
prefer
to
delay
it
until
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
has
been
finally
determined.
the
policy
of
congress
as
adopted
in
section
15(7)
was
essentially
a
compromise.
it
provided
that
during
the
first
seven
months,
the
risks
and
the
burdens
of
a
proposed
rate
change
should
be
placed
entirely
on
the
carriers.
that
is,
if
the
commission
chooses
to
suspend,
the
carrier
cannot
implement
its
rate
change
and
if
the
rates
are
ultimately
found
to
be
lawful,
the
carrier
has
no
remedy,
it
can
never
recover
the
lost
remedies
or
the
other
lost
benefits
of
that
seven
month
period.

your
honor,
this
court
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
reflecting
in
anyway
upon
decisions
recognizing
a
limited
power
of
the
courts
to
preserve
the
status

pending

ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
is
not
this
case.
to
begin
with,
the
--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
what
was
on
review
was
a
final
agency
action,
your
honor,
but
this
footnote
does
not
apply
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
not
issued
pending
judicial
review,
it
was
issued
at
the
conclusion
of
the
review
proceeding,
pending
reconsideration
of
the
case
by
the
agency.
secondly,
the
suspension
order
entered
here
by
the
court
did
not
preserve
the
status
quo.
these
rates
have
been
in
effect
for
over
a
year.
the
effect
of
the
court's
order
was
to
change
the
status
quo.
so
the
suggestion
of
a
limited
power
to
maintain
the
status
quo
pending
judicial
review
simply
is
not
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
careful
congressional
balancing
of
the
risks
and
burdens
of
suspension
which
this
court
held
in
arrow,
congress
intended
to
place
on
the
carrier
for
the
first
seven
months
and
upon
the
shippers
thereafter,
subject
to
the
protection
of
a
possible
accounting
and
refund
provision
of
a
recollection
suit
applies
equally
when
the
case
is
pending
before
the
commission
on
remand,
as
when
it
was
pending
before
the
commission
in
the
first
instance.
in
neither
event
has
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
than
finally
determined.
and
we
believe
that
the
congressional
policy
is
that
once
the
seventh
month
period
has
expired,
the
carriers
are
entitled
to
place
their
rates
into
effect
and
to
keep
them
in
effect
unless
and
until
the
rates
are
finally
adjudged
unlawful.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
this
is
exactly
the
point
i
was
coming
to
mr.
justice
stewart.

that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case
--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
yes
your
honor,
it
is
solely
a
question
of
substantial
evidence.
it
would
be
up
to
the
agency
as
to
whether
to
decide
the
case
on
the
present
record
in
which
case
they
would
be
obliged
to
summarily
find
that
the
rates
have
not
been
shown
just
and
reasonable,
and
to
order
a
--
or
to
order
(voice

ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
would
not
say
automatically,
your
honor.
certainly
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
a
court
opinion
makes
it
clear
that
under
the
legal
standards
established
by
the
court,
the
rates
cannot
possibly
be
justified.
in
that
situation,
the
commission
would
have
no
alternative,
but
to
immediately
enter
it
an
order.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
that
the
court
could
not
order
them
to
find
the
rates
unlawful,
but
certainly
its
opinion
could
be
written
in
such
a
way
that
under
the
court's
legal
standards,
the
commission
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
find
them
unlawful.
in
that
situation,
the
commission
could
simply
enter
an
order
finding
an
accordance
with
the
legal
standards
established
by
the
court
that
the
rates
have
not
been
shown
to
be
just
unreasonable
and
ordering
them
canceled.
if
it
was
strictly
a
question
of
substantial
evidence
which
might
be
supplemented
by
further
evidence,
then
there
would
be
a
matter
for
the
discretion
for
the
commission
as
to
whether
to
permit
the
carriers
to
reopen
the
record
to
offer
further
evidence.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
certainly,
in
connection
with
an
appeal
of
the
agency's
final
decision
to
court,
the
courts
and
the
agency
have
assumed
that
the
courts
have
the
power
to
issue
an
accounting
and
refund
order.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
issued
an
accounting
and
refund
requirement
at
the
time
that
it
granted
a
stay
of
the
lower
court's
judgment
in
this
case.
we
have
always
assumed
that
the
court
does
have
that
power.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
exactly,
your
honor.
it
is
other
equitable
powers
to
impose
conditions
for
the
protection
of
the
shipments
such
as
an
accounting
and
refund
provisions
are
not
affected
in
anyway.
in
addition
to
the
congressional
policy
which
i
have
mentioned
that
the
carriers
be
permitted
to
put
their
rates
into
effect
after
seven
months
and
keep
them
in
effect
unless
and
until
they
are
found
unlawful,
we
believe
the
arrow
decision
cited
two
additional
policy
reasons
for
denying
the
court's
power
of
judicial
suspension
which
we
believe
are
equally
applicable
when
the
case
is
pending
before
the
commission
on
remand
as
when
it
was
pending
in
the
first
instance.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
exercise
of
a
judicial
suspension
power
would
interfere
with
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
agency
and
as
i
have
just
pointed
out
in
answering
mr.
justice
white's
questions,
the
agency
continues
to
have
primary
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
specific
rates
even
though
an
error
of
law
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
courts
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
commission.
the
actual
determination
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
is
still
for
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
and
the
same
nexus
that
this
court
found
in
arrow
between
primary
jurisdiction
and
the
suspension
power
applies
here
as
in
the
situation
that
existed
in
arrow.
secondly
this
court
pointed
out
in
arrow
that
if
the
courts
were
permitted
to
suspend,
the
result
might
be
different
results
to
different
shippers.
the
same
situation
could
occur
if
the
judicial
suspension
were
permitted
in
connection
with
a
remand
because
as
this
court
is
aware,
any
number
of
suits
can
be
brought
to
set
aside
the
same
commission
order
in
district
courts
all
over
the
country.
if
those
courts
should
reach
different
results,
one
sustaining
and
the
other
reversing
the
commission
and
if
the
reversing
court
were
permitted
to
exercise
a
suspension
power,
then
you
would
have
the
same
type
of
different
results
to
different
shippers
that
this
court
was
concerned
within
arrow.
thank
you.
