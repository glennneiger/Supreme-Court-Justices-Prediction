mr.
william
a.
imhof
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
imhof,
i
represent
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
the
secretary
is
represented
here
today
because
both
of
the
issues
principally
before
the
court
today
are
of
vital
concern
to
farmers.
farmers
after
all
are
the
fellows
who
are
bearing
this
charge
that
we
have
been
fighting
about.
the
grain
farmer
in
the
west
sells
his
grain
to
a
country
elevator.
he
receives
the
price
that
day
at
minneapolis
or
chicago
less
the
cost
of
getting
it
there
by
railroad.
historically,
line-haul
rate
included
a
stop
for
inspection
which
facilitated
that
the
sell
of
the
grain
at
the
market.
now
the
railroads
have
added
a
penalty
charge
over
and
above
the
line-haul
rates
for
the
inspection
and
that
penalty
charge
too
is
deducted
from
the
price
the
farmer
receives
for
his
grain.
and
this
burden
is
especially
better
for
the
farmer
because
he
knows
and
indeed
our
friends,
the
railroads
conceded
at
the
hearing
below,
that
they
were
already
collecting
for
this
inspection
charge
out
of
the
line-haul
rate
and
therefore
the
new
inspection
charge
from
a
revenue
standpoint
for
the
railroads
is
largely
gravy.
however,
we
are
more
greatly
concerned
and
i
will
confine
my
remarks
to
appellant's
attack
upon
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
district
courts,
upon
review
of
icc
orders
and
this
issue
is
of
concern
not
only
to
grain
farmers
but
to
farmers
generally.
farmers
rely
heavily
upon
rail
transportation
for
both
transportation
of
their
produce
and
also
for
their
supplies.
their
livelihood,
sometimes
even
their
economic
survival
depends
on
having
available
rail
transportation
at
reasonable
rates.
of
course,
what
is
their
first
line
of
defense
against
unreasonable
rates?
it's
the
commission,
but
if
the
commission
makes
a
mistake,
if
it
approves
a
railroad
proposed
charge
on
less
than
requisite
amount
of
substantial
evidence,
where
should
they
go?
until
recently,
it
seemed
clear
enough
that
a
shipper
could
bring
suit
in
a
three-judge
district
court
which
if
it
sustained
his
charges
about
the
commission's
failure,
could
enjoin
collection
of
the
charge.
this
was
the
view
of
the
alabama
district
court
and
of
the
fifth
circuit
whose
judgments
you
affirmed
in
the
case
in
arrow.
in
this
case
of
course,
it
was
the
view
of
the
district
court
in
kansas.
we
belief
it
was
also
the
district
court
--
the
view
of
the
district
courts
in
california
in
the
cantley
case,
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
ad
hoc
committee
on
consumer
protection
case.
i
think
we
might
note
in
passing
that
it
was
also
the
view
of
the
illinois
district
court
in
the
inland
waterways
case
which
was
relied
upon
by
the
railroads,
this
court
reversed
the
district
court
in
that
case
but
didn't
question
the
exercise
of
equitable
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court.
i
think
the
district
court
in
that
case
did
go
too
far
and
foreclosed
the
discretion
of
the
agency
on
remand
and
that
was
the
reason
that
it
was
overturned
by
this
court.
just
over
two
years
ago,
however,
a
district
court,
three-judge
district
court
in
new
york
declined
to
enjoin
collection
of
commission
approved
rates
on
the
ground
that
the
theory
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
arrow
logically
extended
foreclosed
such
relief.
the
small
shipment
decision
was
of
course
pressed
upon
the
kansas
court
in
this
case,
but
the
kansas
court
declined
to
alter
its
judgment
and
indeed
refused
to
stay
of
its
judgment
especially
because
the
farmer
who
was
bearing
this
inspection
charge,
can
be
protected
only
if
collection
of
the
charge
is
enjoined.
the
appellants
argue
that
the
injunction
issue
is
controlled
by
arrow
and
that
under
section
15(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
only
the
commission
can
suspend
the
railroad
rate
and
then
only
for
the
statutory
period.
however
they
overlook
the
fact
that
the
suspension
provision
in
section
15(7)
is
confined
by
its
own
terms
to
the
period
prior
to
commission
decision
and
they
also
overlook
the
fact
that
in
arrow,
both
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
were
careful
to
confine
their
holdings
to
the
situation
presented,
that
is
where
the
commission
had
not
yet
completed
its
investigation
or
issued
an
order.
while
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
arrow
denied
the
availability
of
injunctive
relief
at
that
stage,
both
concluded
that
after
final
order
by
the
commission
approving
railroad
rates,
the
three-judge
court
upon
review
of
that
order
has
the
power
to
enjoin
the
effect
in
the
rates,
in
affirming
those
judgments.
this
court
also
pointed
out
that
judicial
cognizance
of
the
reasonableness
of
rates
is
confined
to
review
by
a
three-judge
court
of
the
icc
order,
it
can't
take
place
before
that.
we
submit
that
therefore
upon
a
fair
reading
arrow
lends
no
support
to
appellant's
arguments.
this
is
not
simply
our
conclusion.
we
would
refer
your
honors
to
the
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
is
referred
to
in
the
decision
in
ad
hoc
committee
on
consumer
protection.
we
note
also
that
in
that
case,
the
court
held
injunctive
relief
to
be
available
not
withstanding
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
motion
for
reconsideration
before
the
commission.
the
dichotomy
drawn
by
the
courts
in
arrow
and
ad
hoc
between
the
judicial
roll
before
and
after
decision
by
the
commission
approving
rates
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
statutory
scheme.
the
congress
provided
for
two
situations.
the
arrow
case
dealt
with
of
them
and
that
was
shippers
resorting
to
injunction
prior
to
commission
decision
and
they
amended
15(7)
to
provide
for
that.
but
in
this
case
we
are
not
talking
about
15(7),
we
are
talking
about
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
which
congress
provided
especially
for
judicial
review
of
commission
orders.
it
created
a
commerce
court
and
transferred
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
in
turn
to
the
district
courts.
it
had
no
intention
at
anytime
of
restricting
the
equitable
powers
of
the
circuit
courts
or
the
commerce
court
in
making
those
transfers.
i
think
i
would
like
to
address
a
couple
of
specific
points
which
have
been
of
interest
to
the
justices
in
the
arguments
presented
heretofore
this
morning.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
on
footnote
22,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
imhof
first
of
all
i
think
we
might
argue,
we
might
well
remember
that
the
court
here
did
not
flatly
remanded
to
the
commission
and
lose
hold
of
it.
the
court
retained
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
so
it
is
for
all
practical
purposes
pending
judicial
review
and
professor
(inaudible)
at
least
has
sanctioned
that
as
a
legitimate
judicial
device
to
retain
jurisdiction
of
a
case.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
yes,
your
honor,
i
suppose
it
would
be,
yeah.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
i
would
assume
that
it
would
be
remanded
with
directions.
it
was
not
remanded
with
directions
here
or
may
be
it
was.
the
proceeding
is
not
in
consistent
with
its
opinion.
so
the
answer
will
be
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
i
would
like
to
address
perhaps
your
honor's
question
about
the
possibility
of
a
decision
being
bated
back
and
forth
between
the
reviewing
court
and
the
commission.
i
think
if
you
logically
extend
the
commission's
argument
to
its
fullest
length
you
are
reviving
the
negative
order
doctrine.
as
you
remember
the
commerce
court
produced
the
decision
in
procter
&
gamble
and
in
procter
&
gamble,
this
court
held
that
an
order
such
as
the
one
we
are
referring
to
here
is
a
negative
order
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
of
course,
then
injunctive
relief
was
not
available
because
the
court
never
even
got
jurisdiction
over
the
order.
but
if
you
push
their
argument
to
its
logical
extent,
i
think
we
are
getting
right
back
to
the
negative
order
doctrine
and
i
don't
believe
this
court
should
take
that
action.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
in
overturning
the
negative
order
doctrine
in
the
rochester
telephone
case,
had
any
intention
of
the
--
mr.
william
a.
imhof
i
tend
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
a
matter
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
until
there
is
an
order
of
the
commission,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
that's
a
very
valid
and
vital
distinction
in
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
till
there
is
an
order
of
the
commission
in
the
proceeding
pending
at
that
time
before
the
commission.
the
judgment
made
by
the
congress
was
to
keep
the
courts
out
of
the
commission's
hair
for
whatever
period
of
time
it
required
for
the
commission
to
exercise
initially
at
least
its
primary
jurisdiction.
that
period
varied.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
if
the
rates
were
just
and
reasonable?
mr.
william
a.
imhof
no,
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
a
court
could
suspend
the
rates
if
it
found
that
the
commission's
decision
was
not
supported
in
your
example
by
substantial
evidence.
therefore
the
commission's
finding
that
the
rates
were
just
and
reasonable
would
have
no
support,
it
would
be
invalid
to
find
support.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
and
not
once
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
i
would
submit
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
can
draw
on
this
dichotomy
between
judicial
review
of
an
order
and
equitable
relief
and
i
feel
this
matter
is
perhaps
disposed
off
in
the
footnote
in
the
the
rochester
telephone
case
as
to
the
forms
of
directions
which
would
be
available
to
a
court
upon
review
of
such
an
order.
i
believe
it's
1229.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
i
am
not
sure
if
i
did
or
not,
your
honor,
i
believe
i
answered
the
first
part
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
is
retaining
jurisdiction,
pending
judicial
review
and
mr.
sweeney
has
pointed
the
case
as
indicating
the
status
quo
can
be
restored
and
i
submit
to
your
honor,
that
effect
would
answer
the
second
question.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
with
that
argument,
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
imhof,
i
represent
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
the
secretary
is
represented
here
today
because
both
of
the
issues
principally
before
the
court
today
are
of
vital
concern
to
farmers.

however,
we
are
more
greatly
concerned
and
i
will
confine
my
remarks
to
appellant's
attack
upon
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
district
courts,
upon
review
of
icc
orders
and
this
issue
is
of
concern
not
only
to
grain
farmers
but
to
farmers
generally.
farmers
rely
heavily
upon
rail
transportation
for
both
transportation
of
their
produce
and
also
for
their
supplies.
their
livelihood,
sometimes
even

on
having

rail
transportation
at
reasonable

of

what
is

it's
the

but
if
the

if

on
less
than

where
should
they
go?
until
recently,
it
seemed
clear
enough
that
a
shipper
could
bring

in
a
three-judge
district
court
which
if
it
sustained
his
charges
about
the
commission's
failure,
could
enjoin
collection
of
the
charge.
this
was
the
view
of
the
alabama
district
court
and
of
the
fifth
circuit
whose
judgments
you
affirmed
in
the
case
in
arrow.
in
this
case
of
course,
it
was
the
view
of
the
district
court
in
kansas.
we
belief
it
was
also
the
district
court
--
the
view
of
the
district
courts
in
california
in
the
cantley
case,
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
ad
hoc
committee
on
consumer
protection
case.
i
think
we
might
note
in
passing
that
it
was
also
the
view
of
the
illinois
district
court
in
the
inland
waterways
case
which
was
relied
upon
by
the
railroads,
this
court
reversed
the
district
court
in
that
case
but
didn't
question
the
exercise
of
equitable
jurisdiction
by
the
district

i
think
the
district
court
in
that
case
did
go
too
far
and
foreclosed
the
discretion
of
the
agency
on
remand
and
that
was
the
reason
that
it
was
overturned
by
this

just
over
two
years

however,
a
district
court,
three-judge

on
the
ground
that

the

but
the
kansas
court
declined

indeed
refused
to
stay
of
its

especially
because
the
farmer
who
was
bearing
this
inspection
charge,
can
be
protected
only
if
collection
of
the
charge
is
enjoined.
the
appellants
argue
that
the
injunction
issue
is
controlled
by
arrow
and
that
under
section
15(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
only
the
commission
can
suspend
the
railroad
rate
and
then
only
for
the
statutory
period.
however
they
overlook
the
fact
that
the
suspension
provision
in
section
15(7)
is
confined
by
its
own
terms
to
the
period
prior
to
commission
decision
and
they
also
overlook
the

this

also
pointed
out
that

of
rates
is
confined
to
review
by
a
three-judge
court
of
the
icc

it
can't
take
place
before
that.
we
submit
that
therefore
upon
a
fair
reading
arrow
lends
no
support
to
appellant's
arguments.
this
is
not
simply
our
conclusion.
we
would
refer
your

to
the

of
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
is
referred
to
in
the
decision
in
ad

committee
on

we
note
also
that
in
that

the

injunctive
relief
to
be

not
withstanding
that
there
was
a

are
not
talking
about
15(7),
we
are
talking
about
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
which
congress
provided
especially
for
judicial
review
of
commission
orders.
it
created
a
commerce
court
and
transferred
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
in
turn
to
the
district
courts.
it
had
no
intention
at
anytime
of
restricting
the
equitable
powers
of
the
circuit
courts
or
the
commerce
court
in
making
those
transfers.
i
think
i
would
like
to
address
a
couple
of
specific
points
which
have
been
of
interest
to
the
justices
in
the
arguments
presented
heretofore
this
morning.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
on
footnote
22,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.
imhof
first
of
all
i
think
we
might
argue,
we
might
well
remember
that
the
court
here
did
not
flatly
remanded
to
the
commission
and
lose
hold
of
it.
the
court
retained
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
so
it
is
for
all
practical
purposes
pending
judicial
review
and
professor
(inaudible)
at
least
has
sanctioned
that
as
a
legitimate
judicial
device
to
retain
jurisdiction
of
a
case.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
yes,
your
honor,
i
suppose
it
would
be,
yeah.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
i
would
assume
that
it
would
be
remanded
with
directions.
it
was
not
remanded
with
directions
here
or
may
be
it
was.
the
proceeding
is
not
in
consistent
with
its
opinion.
so
the
answer
will
be
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
i
would
like
to
address
perhaps
your
honor's
question
about
the
possibility
of
a
decision
being
bated
back
and
forth
between
the
reviewing
court
and
the
commission.
i
think
if
you
logically
extend
the
commission's
argument
to
its
fullest
length
you
are
reviving
the
negative
order
doctrine.
as
you
remember
the
commerce
court
produced
the
decision
in
procter
&
gamble
and
in
procter
&
gamble,
this
court
held
that
an
order
such
as
the
one
we
are
referring
to
here
is
a
negative
order
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
of
course,
then
injunctive
relief
was
not
available
because
the
court
never
even
got
jurisdiction
over
the
order.
but
if
you
push
their
argument
to
its
logical
extent,
i
think
we
are
getting
right
back
to
the
negative
order
doctrine
and
i
don't
believe
this
court
should
take
that
action.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
in
overturning
the
negative
order
doctrine
in
the
rochester
telephone
case,
had
any
intention
of
the
--
mr.
william
a.
imhof
i
tend
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
a
matter
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
until
there
is
an
order
of
the
commission,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
that's
a
very
valid
and
vital
distinction
in
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
till
there
is
an
order
of
the
commission
in
the
proceeding
pending
at
that
time
before
the
commission.
the
judgment
made
by
the
congress
was
to
keep
the
courts
out
of
the
commission's
hair
for
whatever
period
of
time
it
required
for
the
commission
to
exercise
initially
at
least
its
primary
jurisdiction.
that
period
varied.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
if
the
rates
were
just
and
reasonable?
mr.
william
a.
imhof
no,
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
a
court
could
suspend
the
rates
if
it
found
that
the
commission's
decision
was
not
supported
in
your
example
by
substantial
evidence.
therefore
the
commission's
finding
that
the
rates
were
just
and
reasonable
would
have
no
support,
it
would
be
invalid
to
find
support.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
and
not
once
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
i
would
submit
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
can
draw
on
this
dichotomy
between
judicial
review
of
an
order
and
equitable
relief
and
i
feel
this
matter
is
perhaps
disposed
off
in
the
footnote
in
the
the
rochester
telephone
case
as
to
the
forms
of
directions
which
would
be
available
to
a
court
upon
review
of
such
an
order.
i
believe
it's
1229.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
i
am
not
sure
if
i
did
or
not,
your
honor,
i
believe
i
answered
the
first
part
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
is
retaining
jurisdiction,
pending
judicial
review
and
mr.
sweeney
has
pointed
the
case
as
indicating
the
status
quo
can
be
restored
and
i
submit
to
your
honor,
that
effect
would
answer
the
second
question.
mr.
william
a.
imhof
with
that
argument,
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
thank
you
very
much.
