mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
representing
here
the
wichita
board
of
trade
and
37
other
grain
industry
groups
which
comprise
in
effect
the
farmers
in
the
western
united
states,
the
country
grain
elevator
operators
in
that
part
of
the
country,
as
well
as
the
boards
of
trade
on
which
grain
is
bought
and
sold
and
many
of
the
grain
companies
which
are
the
people
who
buy
and
sell
the
grain.
first
of
all,
this
concept
of
inspection
does
not
explain
itself.
what
we
mean
here
by
inspection
is
a
grading
of
the
grain
in
order
to
determine
the
quality
of
the
grain
and
the
value
of
the
grain.
grain
is
susceptible
to
moisture,
susceptible
to
contamination
of
farm
material
and
kernel
content
and
this
type
of
thing.
so
that
to
know
the
other
call
out
of
grain
does
not
tell
you
anything
about
what
it
is
value
is
or
whether
it
can
be
used
for
human
food
and
things
like
that.
so
you
have
to
get
a
grade
in
order
to
determine
these
things.
the
practice
over
the
years
as
these
gentleman
have
told
you
and
the
young
lady
has
been
to
take
this
grade
at
a
marketplace
such
as
chicago
or
kansas
city
or
omaha.
the
cars
come
in
there
and
the
government
employed
samplers
take
the
the
sample
of
the
grain.
they
write
down
to
board
of
trade
and
it
is
inspected
and
analyzed
by
impartial
government
people
and
they
say,
this
carload
is
number
2,
yellow
corn
and
it
has
so
much
moisture
in
it
and
so
forth.
at
that
point,
it
becomes
a
salable
commodity
because
we
know
what
we
have.
so
that
the
reason
why
the
grain
has
been
inspected
in
transit
has
not
been
because
of
the
grain
standards
act.
it
has
been
because
this
is
the
place
to
do
it.
this
is
where
the
market
is,
this
is
the
condition
of
a
grain
on
a
day
that
it
is
sold
on
a
market
and
this
is
where
the
impartial
inspection
is
available.
the
change
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
no,
it
shipped
to
the
market.
it
will
go
from
a
country
elevated
to
the
market
say
to
omaha
for
instructions
and
re-consignment.
after
the
inspection
is
made
then
whoever
buys
the
grains
says
well,
ship
it
to
chicago
or
something
like
that.
you
do
not
know
who
is
going
to
buy
the
grain
until
it
is
inspected,
that
is
the
whole
idea.
in
other
words,
when
you
bring
it
to
central
grain
exchange,
they
can
bring
that
sample
before
the
board
of
trade
and
people
all
over
the
country,
all
of
the
world
can
bid
on
that
grain
and
in
effect
the
farmers
getting
the
benefit
of
this
total
market.
the
other
way
to
go
always
for
the
farmer
to
ship
his
grain
to
omaha
to
one
of
the
handful
--
maybe
half
a
dozen
elevators
that
are
located
there.
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
those
people,
he
has
to
sell
to
them.
the
other
way
he
can
go
now
is
to
ship
it
in
there
and
have
it
inspected
and
pay
the
$17,
in
which
case
he
is
paying
$17
extra
a
car
was
something
that
he
has
always
done
and
which
is
already
paid
for
under
the
line
haul
rate
itself.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well,
i
think
the
alternative
that
many
people
have
suggested
is
that
if
the
railroads
are
really
concerned
about
giving
the
shippers
an
incentive
to
eliminate
the
grain
inspection,
the
thing
for
them
to
do
would
be
to
reduce
their
rates.
in
other
words,
let
us
say
the
rate
is
$0.20
from
a
point
in
nebraska
at
omaha.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
the
carrier
has
no
interest
in
the
quality
of
grain,
however,
by
providing
a
service
which
is
of
value,
he
is
enhancing
the
attractiveness
of
the
railroad
service,
but
the
point
is
that
the
carriers,
when
they
made
the
$0.20
rate
for
example,
they
put
into
that
rate
$0.2
specifically
because
of
the
cost
of
the
grain
inspection,
this
was
stipulated
in
the
record.
if
the
rate
was
not
a
full
service
rate,
if
the
rate
did
not
include
the
grain
inspection,
that
rate
would
be
$0.18.
so
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is
if
they
want
to
give
them
an
incentive,
let
us
do
what
they
should
do.
they
can
not
take
away
the
service
and
continue
the
charge
us
the
full
$0.20.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well,
if
you
are
talking
about
the
$17
per
car
charge,
the
$17
approximates
what
it
costs
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
they
are
always
not
losing
money
on
grain
traffic.
they
are
making
a
very
substantial
profit.
for
example,
somebody
put
some
evidence
in
that
on
the
whole,
they
are
making
150%
of
the
direct
cost.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
am
trying
to
get
your
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
now,
he
has
not
said
that
he
is
losing
money
on
inspection
process.
what
he
has
said
is
that
part
of
the
total
transportation
as
has
existed
has
been
a
portion
in
the
middle
whereby
the
grain
has
been
inspected
and
takes
three
days
to
do
that
and
he
said
they
are
occupying
our
cars
for
three
days.
now,
if
we
can
put
something
new
in
the
tariff,
that
will
discourage
that,
eliminate
it,
then
we
can
free
up
more
cars
and
alleviate
to
some
extent
the
grain
car
shortage,
this
is
the
basic
proposition
on
which
they
present
this
case
to
the
icc.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor
because
if
they
want
to
do
that,
they
would
have
proposed
and
said,
as
from
tomorrow,
we
will
not
form
any
grain
inspections,
regardless
of
price.
they
have
not
done
that.
they
said,
we
will
continue
to
perform
grain
inspections,
but
we
will
do
it
at
an
additional
cost
of
$17
in
addition
to
our
rates
which
already
pay
us
once
for
that.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well,
they
are
competing
with
other
modes
of
transportation.
railroads
are
not
the
only
way
to
route
this
grain
and
by
having
this
grain
inspection
and
allowing
the
grain
to
come
to
the
market
in
a
car,
the
man
in
the
field,
the
farmer,
he
has
an
opportunity
of
bringing
his
grain
to
market
and
getting
a
price
on
a
competitive
market.
now
the
other
way
he
can
go
is
he
can
put
on
a
truck
and
he
can
send
it
to
market
but
if
he
does
that,
he
is
not
going
to
get
the
same
market
structure.
he
is
not
going
to
have
the
advantage
of
a
nationwide
buyers,
he
is
going
to
get
less
money.
for
example,
he
could
have
a
lower
truck
rate
than
the
rail
rate
and
this
many
times
happens
and
he
can
ship
by
rail
nevertheless
at
a
higher
price
because
when
he
gets
to
the
market,
he
is
going
to
have
the
advantage
of
the
marketplace.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
the
inspection
helps
the
carrier
to
get
grain
on
his
railroad
instead
of
having
that
grain
go
down
the
river
on
the
barge,
instead
of
going
by
truck.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
yes
your
honor
we
object
it
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
he
is
destroying
the
marketing
structure
which
we
have
built
up
over
50
years.
he
is
putting
a
lot
of
people
out
of
business
that
are
involved
in
this
thing.
the
second
thing
that
he
is
doing
is
he
is
saying
to
us,
i
am
going
to
take
the
service
away
from
you
and
as
i
continue
to
charge
you
a
rate
which
includes
a
specific
cost
of
that
service.
we
would
have
a
much
different
case,
if
they
were
here
saying,
we
took
our
rates
and
we
took
two
cents
off,
we
have
published
upper
grades.
now
this
is
what
has
happened
in
the
past,
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
at
such
cross
roads.
in
the
past
where
the
railroads
wanted
to
put
rates
in
without
inspection,
they
have
reduced
their
rate.
they
have
said
we
will
drop
from
$0.20
to
$0.18.
we
will
now
give
you
an
$0.18
rate
which
you
can
use
without
grain
inspection.
we
will
give
you
an
incentive
and
this
is
what
has
happened
and
now
all
of
a
sudden,
they
have
switched
into
this
new
position.
they
want
to
take
away
the
grain
inspection
and
they
want
to
keep
the
higher
rates
which
compensate
them
for
it
and
they
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
if
they
want
to
go
down
this
other
road,
if
they
want
to
come
back
next
week,
they
can
publish
a
new
tariff
and
say,
every
rate
in
the
west
shall
be
$0.2
lower
whenever
a
grain
inspection
is
weighed.
this
is
a
way
that
they
could
have
gone.
they
could
have
avoided
all
these
problems.
they
could
have
solved
the
car
supply
problem
that
they
have
been
talking
about
that
it
said
that
they
want,
but
they
did
not
want
to
do
that.
they
wanted
to
add
a
charge
so
that
the
man
who
takes
the
grain
inspection
has
to
pay
for
it
once
in
the
rate
and
secondly
with
the
$17
and
the
man
who
was
prevented
from
doing
it
because
he
says,
i
do
not
want
to
add
another
$17,
he
still
pays
the
old
rate
which
included
the
compensation.
so
that
people
that
are
using
the
inspection
are
being
deprived
because
they're
paying
double,
people
who
don't
use
the
inspection
are
being
deprived
of
the
service
that
they're
paying
for
right
now
today.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
it
certainly
is
your
honor.
it's
increasing
the
total
charges
and
in
effect
it's
increasing
the
line
haul
rate
indirectly
by
reducing
the
service.
you
still
pay
the
same
price
but
you
get
a
service
more.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well,
it's
selected,
your
honor,
as
we
figure
they've
collected
between
four
and
five
million
dollars
a
year
on
this
so
they've
been
getting
money
on
this.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
find
that
paradoxical.
i
think
if
they
were
really
sincere
and
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
get
this
goal
of
helping
the
car
supply,
they
would
come
out
with
a
very
straightforward
proposition.
they
would
say
we're
going
to
knock
two
cents
off
every
rate.
as
of
tomorrow,
if
you
don't
take
your
inspection,
you're
going
to
save
two
cents.
this
is
what
i
call
an
incentive.
what
they've
been
calling
an
incentive
is
actually
a
penalty.
they're
saying
you're
already
paying
for
it
once,
tomorrow
you're
going
to
pay
for
it
twice.
we
can't
go
along
with
that.
unfortunately,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
did.
now,
we
get
to
the
question
of
why
are
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decisions
renewed
at
all
by
courts.
the
reason
is,
because
congress
put
statutes
and
they
said
you
can
interpret
these
statutes
and
you
can
apply
them
to
the
facts,
but
you
can't
do
it
arbitrarily
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
have
an
arbitrary
decision.
we
have
decision
where
the
commission
was
overwhelmed
with
all
this
evidence
and
repetitive
testimony,
all
this
legislative
history
from
the
grain
standards
act
about
how
important
car
supply
is,
and
how
this
thing
is
going
to
help
car
supply.
so
the
commissioners
are
sitting
there
and
they've
got
letters
in
their
files,
they've
got
complaints,
they've
got
people
criticizing
them
in
the
newspapers
about
the
car
supply.
really,
the
problem
is
that
the
railroads
just
don't
buy
enough
cars
to
replace
the
old
ones.
in
the
last
15
years,
they've
dropped
300,000
box
cars,
they
used
to
have
over
600,000.
now
we've
got
300,000
plus.
so
when
they
talk
about
a
saving
here,
300,000
cars
a
year
or
600,000
cars
a
year,
this
is
not
the
solution
to
the
car
shortage
problem.
it's
a
small
step
in
that
direction,
but
it's
not
the
great
solution
as
presented.
so
the
commission
looked
up
and
they
said,
well
this
is
a
car
supply
case,
we're
going
to
approve
this
thing
and
at
that
point
they
said
we
are
not
going
to
follow
the
statute
and
we're
not
going
to
look
at
this
pile
of
evidence
over
here.
we,
at
the
commission
know
well
enough,
what's
good
for
the
public,
what's
good
for
the
railroad's
car
supply.
we
don't
have
to
look
at
statute
then
we
have
to
look
to
the
merits
of
the
decision
with
this
background,
because
this
is
really
the
background
on
which
the
commission
decided
the
case.
when
the
commission
came
here,
in
a
jurisdictional
statement
they
specifically
said
to
this
court
that
they
were
not
going
to
ask
the
court
to
review
the
merits
of
their
decision.
apparently
at
that
time,
when
they
first
came
here
they
were
convinced
that
they
couldn't
defend
their
decision.
in
the
last
few
months
something
has
happened.
they
filed
a
brief
and
they're
now
trying
to
defend
themselves
on
the
merits.
i'm
not
going
to
question
their
right
to
do
that,
but
i
think
it
does
show
a
little
bit
that
there
was
certain
lack
of
confidence
in
their
own
decision.
what
do
you
have
to
prove
in
a
case
like
this?
you
have
to
prove
that
the
changes,
in
the
rates
and
charges
are
just
and
reasonable.
this
is
section
15(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now
one
bar
is
on
thing,
when
you
have
concepts
of
just
and
reasonable,
it's
somewhat
vague
and
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
well,
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
particular
act,
congress
put
in
specific
standards
that
the
commission
shall
consider
in
determining
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
the
standards
are
in
15
(a)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
one
thing
is
that
they
must
show
that
the
rates
are
at
the
lowest
cost
consistent
with
the
total
services
and
the
other
thing
is,
they
have
to
show
the
effect
on
the
movement
of
the
traffic,
whether
or
not
the
traffic
would
be
diverted.
so
the
commission
then
has
to
come
to
grips
with
the
situation.
more
specifically
within
three
months
before
these
tariffs
were
published,
the
district
court
in
ohio
had
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
icc
in
the
transit
charges
case,
which
was
the
same
kind
of
a
situation.
the
southern
railroads
decided
that
we've
been
providing
transit
on
cotton
for
long
time
at
the
line
haul
rate.
we
will
now
add
a
charge
of
something
like
$50
a
car
for
it.
that
case
went
before
the
icc
and
the
icc
decided,
one
you
have
got
to
present
costs
for
the
through
movement,
show
us
how
much
it
cost
to
handle
this
traffic,
how
much
your
cost
is
for
the
transit
and
give
us
your
total
revenue
and
your
total
cost,
otherwise
we
can't
determine
the
overall
reasonableness
of
your
proposal.
the
other
thing
i
said
is
that
there
would
be
a
likelihood
that
you're
going
to
lose
lot
of
traffic
to
the
trucks
if
you
raise
your
rate
like
this.
that
case
went
to
the
district
court
in
ohio,
and
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
and
then
went
to
this
court
and
was
affirmed.
so
here
we're
starting
out
and
we're
going
to
trial
in
this
case
and
the
railroads
have
got
to
prove
these
things.
yet,
they
put
in
no
evidence
whatsoever
on
these
issues
and
this
is
how
the
case
comes
to
the
commission
and
they
are
sitting,
trying
to
write
a
report
which
is
going
to
find
these
rates
just
and
reasonable
when
the
railroads
have
put
no
evidence
in
on
two
issues
that
are
spelled
out
by
section
15
(a)
(2).
well,
they
had
quite
a
job
on
the
hand
trying
to
do
that.
here
is
how
they
went
about
it.
they
said
well,
we
don't
have
to
follow
the
principles
of
the
southern
transit
case,
which
incidentally
are
the
statutory
principles.
they
said,
this
case
is
different
from
the
southern
transit
case
where
we
said
you
have
to
have
total
cost
with
the
total
movement
and
show
us
how
much
money
you're
making
on
this
traffic
before
we're
going
to
let
you
tack
a
charge
on
top
of
it.
so
they
said,
well,
in
this
case,
we've
got
thousands
of
rates
in
a
wide
area.
where
we've
got
a
big
job
on
our
hands
like
this,
well
it's
just
too
much
to
ask
railroads
to
supply
with
cars.
we
shouldn't
have
to
do
that.
well,
of
course,
the
southern
transit
case
involved
rates
throughout
the
south
and
involved
all
the
railroads
and
involved
thousands
of
rates.
so
this
distinction
was
i
would
say
specious
at
this
point.
i
don't
know
how
stronger
these
people
are
defending
that
in
this
case.
they
talk
about
it
as
a
dictum,
they
walk
away,
it's
virtually
a
dictum.
this
court
many
years
ago
in
the
(inaudible)
divisions
case
said
that
there
are
means
of
meeting
it
when
you've
got
thousands
of
rates
involved,
present
typical
evidence
and
there
was
some
kind
of
a
sample,
show
us
representative
rates
and
that's
good
enough.
this
is
how
the
business
of
the
commission
is
carried
on.
everyday,
all
the
day
we've
got
cases
involving
thousands
of
rates.
nobody
throws
up
their
hands
and
says
there
is
thousands
of
rates,
they
don't
put
any
evidence.
that's
not
true
at
all,
where
you've
got
thousands
of
rates,
the
justification
and
necessity
for
putting
in
these
costs
required
by
the
statute
is
even
greater,
because
there
is
more
people
affected
by
a
case
like
this.
they
could
have
broken
this
case
into
50
different
cases,
let
each
railroad
try
their
own
case.
it
would
be
that
much
less
rates
in
each
one,
but
because
they
all
come
together
and
all
simultaneously
try
to
put
this
thing
across.
it
doesn't
take
out
of
the
statute
and
leave
him
from
the
statutory
burden
of
proof.
the
other
way
that
commission
went
on
this
point
is
they
said,
well,
we
find
that
way
back
in
1934
issued
a
decision
on
grain
rates
and
in
that
case
we
looked
very
closely
and
we
decided
what
a
reasonable
level
of
rate
would
be.
now
if
we
take
those
rates,
and
add
to
it,
every
single
general
increase
we've
had
in
the
last
40
years,
we
will
find
that
that
total
rate
is
still
higher
than
what
the
shippers
would
get
here
if
they
add
the
$17
on
top
of
the
rates
that
they're
paying
today.
what
had
happened
is
that
the
1934
rates
have
become
obsolete.
they
no
longer
move
the
grain
traffic
today.
if
these
were
the
only
rates
that
we
have
in
the
tariffs,
the
grain
traffic
wouldn't
move
by
rail
at
all.
it
would
either
be
uneconomic
or
the
barges
and
the
trucks
would
get
it
on.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
these
rates
are
as
high
as
the
sky.
so
the
commission
said,
well,
we've
got
that,
and
as
long
as
the
railroads
haven't
exceeded
those
rates,
which
their
principle
witness
said,
are
paper
rates
don't
move
any
traffic,
as
long
as
they
don't
like
see
those
rates,
we
find
that,
this
is
alright.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
would
treat
that
as
a
conclusion
rather
than
a
finding.
the
findings
that
are
required
on
the
section
15
(a)
(2),
the
commission
shall
consider
the
relationship
between
the
costs
and
the
revenue.
now
instead
of
doing
what
they're
supposed
to
do
on
the
15
(a)
(2),
they
off
into
the
wide
blue
yonder
and
they
say,
well,
we'll
consider
the
fact
that
these
rates
are
not
higher
than
the
1934
rates
plus
a
150%
over
the
last
40
years.
they
did
not
do
what
the
statute
said.
we
don't
deny
that
they
have
the
right
to
throw
this
kind
of
language
into
report
and
say
well,
these
rates
are
no
higher
than
the
1934
rates
plus
a
150%,
but
that
doesn't
excuse
them
in
anyway,
from
fulfilling
their
function
under
15
(a)
(2),
which
says,
you
shall
consider
the
costs
and
the
revenues.
they
have
to
consider
the
costs
and
the
revenues
today.
this
is
what
it's
all
about.
what's
happening
today?
how
much
does
it
cost
in
the
handle
of
traffic
today?
they
can't
just
simply
say
we've
got
res
judicata,
we've
got
a
rate
that
was
decided
four
years
ago.
there
is
no
res
judicata
in
administrative
law
and
commission
cases.
they've
got
to
come
in.
they've
got
to
get
evidence.
they've
got
to
decide
it
on
the
facts.
they
have
to
know
how
much
profit
are
the
railroads
making
on
these
rates
today.
can
they
afford
to
reduce
the
rate
and
give
them
a
reduced
scale
of
rates
instead
of
adding
something
on
top
of
them,
on
top
of
rates
in
many
cases
which
are
rather
high.
they
try
to
get
off
the
hook.
they
try
to
walk
away
from
the
statute,
or
refine
to
an
old
decision.
now
if
you
stay
with
that
for
a
moment,
let's
say
they
prescribed
the
rates
of
1934,
10
cents,
that
rate
today
is
say
25
cents.
it's
gone
up
150%.
there
was
never
any
prescription
by
the
commission
that
25
cent
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
in
order
to
bridge
this
tremendous
leap
from
a
10
cent
rate
to
a
25
cent
rate,
the
commission
said,
well,
over
the
years
those
cases
have
gone
up
in
this
general
increase
cases
and
therefore
every
time
we
got
any
general
increase
case,
this
rate
now
becomes
a
new
maximum
reasonable
rate.
well,
that
isn't
true
at
all.
they
have
been
taken
to
court
after
general
increase
cases
where
shippers
and
groups
of
shippers
have
ask
the
court
to
review
and
say,
our
rates
are
unjust
and
unreasonable
with
this
5%
increase.
the
commission
and
the
railroads
say,
that's
not
involved
here.
the
level
of
the
rates
and
whether
they
are
just
and
reasonable
is
not
involved
in
our
general
increase
cases.
all
we
are
looking
for
in
general
case
is
a
total
piece
of
money.
we
need
$15
million,
you
could
buy
this
year
and
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates
on
grain,
the
rates
of
potatoes,
the
rates
automobiles
are
just
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
this
court
sustained
a
decision
of
a
district
court
on
exactly
that
point
that
you
can
even
get
a
review
of
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates
established
in
these
general
increase
cases.
now
they
want
to
have
the
other
side
of
the
coin
and
come
back
here
and
say,
oh,
yes,
these
rates
are
just
and
reasonable.
they
were
established
in
a
general
increase
cases
as
just
and
reasonable.
those
two
concepts
cannot
live
together.
there
is
no
room
for
both
of
those
things
do
exist
side-by-side.
if
they
found
them
just
and
reasonable,
then
they
should
really
review
it.
i
don't
see
how
they
could
find
it
just
and
reasonable,
they
never
looked
at
them,
all
they
look
at
in
those
general
increase
cases
is
the
total
revenue
need
of
the
railroads.
so
they
need
5%
more
money
and
if
they
find
that
they
do
it,
they'll
give
it
to
them.
i
want
to
say
just
something
on
this
arrow
case
and
we
have
here
a
special
situation
and
all
the
talk
about
possible
refunds
gives
us
no
help
at
all.
these
people
have
put
in
a
charge
which
they
want
to
be
a
barrier.
they
have
come
into
this
court
to
say
that
since
the
charge
went
in,
50%
of
these
inspections
no
longer
take
place.
so
that
on
the
shipments
which
they
have
precluded,
nobody
is
going
to
get
a
refund
of
$17
a
car
on
a
shipment
that
wasn't
inspected
because
the
charge
was
so
high
that
nobody
could
use
it.
on
the
other
50%
what
happened
to
the
charge
is
that
it
was
passed
onto
the
farmer.
when
the
purchase
was
made
from
the
farmer
they
deduct
the
freight
rate
and
the
$17
a
car,
that's
taken
right
away
from
him.
he
is
not
a
party
to
the
transportation
with
the
railroad,
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
shipment.
he
will
never
get
that
$17
back.
everyday
that
this
case
goes
on
without
restoring
the
district
court's
decree,
the
farmer
is
loosing
$17
on
every
car
that
is
inspected.
the
other
way
he
loses
is
that
he
is
losing
his
market.
he
can't
get
this
nationwide
market
that
we
have
been
providing
him.
so
we
have
people
going
out
of
business.
we
have
grain
inspectors
that
have
been
fired,
we
have
this
whole
system
of
marketing
through
grain
inspection
which
is
being
gradually
destroyed
and
taken
apart
while
the
litigation
goes
forward
and
the
railroads
understandably
and
the
icc,
not
quite
so
understandably
say
that
no
one
can
do
anything
about
it
and
they
rely
upon
arrow
case
which
said
that
we
don't
want
single
judge
courts
doing
a
job
before
the
icc
decision
which
can
only
be
done
by
three-judge
courts
under
the
statute
after
an
icc
decision.
we
summit
that
the
railroads
lose
a
case,
they
can
go
to
court
get
the
commission
set
aside
and
then
they
can
put
their
rates
in.
on
the
other
hand,
the
shipper
should
have
the
same
power.
they
should
have
the
same
right.
they
shouldn't
be
just
going
to
court
to
touch
bases
and
to
go
back
to
the
icc
again.
they
should
be
able
to
get
some
substantial
relief
while
the
case
was
back
to
the
icc.
bearing
in
mind
particularly
that
it
isn't
necessary
for
the
court
to
say
this
is
just
and
reasonable
or
it's
not
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
because
arrow
concerned
itself
with
what
could
take
place
before
the
decision
of
the
commission?
what
would
happen
if
the
commission
doesn't
makes
its
decision
within
a
seven
month
suspension,
but
takes
them
a
year?
what
happens
in
that
five
months
before
the
commission
has
discharged
that
function
and
they
said
we
do
not
think
that
the
court
should
be
taking
a
crack
at
this
kind
of
case
before
the
commission
and
its
primary
jurisdiction,
has
completed
the
record
and
has
made
its
findings.
at
that
point
as
it
was
noted
in
the
footnote
the
case
belongs
to
the
three
judge
courts,
it's
up
to
them
to
decide
and
it's
up
to
them
to
decide
whether
the
situation
is
such
that
they
have
to
grant
some
kind
of
ancillary
relief
and
we
asked
that
court
to
grant
us
ancillary
relief.
we
didn't
have
some
grant,
the
specific
relief
that
they
did,
but
we
asked
them
to
order
the
icc
on
remand
to
immediately
have
this
rates
canceled.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well
the
status
quo,
your
honor,
is
the
last
piece
of
those
status
prior
to
litigation.
in
this
case,
that
was
prior
to
the
publication
of
the
rates,
prior
to
this
controversy
arising
there
was
no
inspection
charge.
now
because
they
had
succeeded
in
maneuvering
this
case
that
by
the
time,
they
got
to
the
courthouse
the
rates
have
been
in
for
a
few
months.
it
doesn't
change
the
court's
right
to
restore
the
status
quo,
the
status
quo
that
existed
before
the
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
don't
think
that
affects
rate
making
one
way
or
the
other
i
think
for
a
court
to
issue
an
injunction
like
they
did
here,
all
they
are
saying
is
that
you
are
required
on
the
16,
section
15
(7)
to
fulfill
a
burden
of
proof
of
showing
the
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
the
district
court
below
found
the
statutory
requirements
that
the
railroads
had
to
put
in
cost.
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record.
the
railroads
had
failed
to
meet
the
burden
of
proof
and
all
of
the
district
court
was
saying
is
since
you've
failed
to
meet
your
burden
of
proof
in
a
case
in
which
you
had
ample
of
time
to
do
so,
as
of
this
date
you
have
no
further
right
to
keep
those
rates
in.
without
prejudice
to
down
the
road
perhaps
the
icc
will
give
them
another
hearing,
perhaps
some
decisions,
some
valid
decisions
will
be
issued
some
day
that
will
approve
this.
but
in
the
mean
time,
the
life
of
these
rates
as
of
september
1971,
when
the
icc
issued
it's
decision,
was
critically
dependent
upon
whether
or
not
the
icc
found
that
they
had
fulfilled
their
burden
of
proof
and
if
they
didn't
fulfill
the
burden
of
proof
as
of
the
next
day,
they
have
no
right
to
be
in
effect
and
the
court
is
in
effect
saying
you
made
a
mistake,
you
didn't
follow
the
law
and
therefore
these
rates
have
to
go
out,
until
such
time
as
you
fulfill
your
obligation
and
prove
that
they
are
just
and
reasonable.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
representing
here
the
wichita
board
of
trade
and
37
other
grain
industry
groups
which
comprise
in
effect
the
farmers
in
the
western
united
states,
the
country
grain
elevator
operators
in
that
part
of
the
country,
as
well
as
the
boards
of
trade
on
which
grain
is
bought
and
sold
and
many
of
the
grain
companies
which
are
the
people
who
buy
and
sell
the
grain.
first
of
all,
this
concept
of
inspection
does
not
explain
itself.
what
we
mean
here
by
inspection
is
a
grading
of
the
grain
in
order
to
determine
the
quality
of
the
grain
and
the
value
of
the
grain.
grain
is
susceptible
to
moisture,
susceptible
to
contamination
of
farm
material
and
kernel
content
and
this
type
of
thing.
so
that
to
know
the
other
call
out
of
grain
does
not
tell
you
anything
about
what
it
is
value
is
or
whether
it
can
be
used
for
human
food
and
things
like
that.
so
you
have
to
get
a
grade
in
order
to
determine
these
things.
the
practice
over
the
years
as
these
gentleman
have
told
you
and
the
young
lady
has
been
to
take
this
grade
at
a
marketplace
such
as
chicago
or
kansas
city
or
omaha.
the
cars
come
in
there
and
the
government
employed
samplers
take
the
the
sample
of
the
grain.
they
write
down
to
board
of
trade
and
it
is
inspected
and
analyzed
by
impartial
government
people
and
they
say,
this
carload
is
number
2,
yellow
corn
and
it
has
so
much
moisture
in
it
and
so
forth.
at
that
point,
it
becomes
a
salable
commodity
because
we
know
what
we
have.
so
that
the
reason
why
the
grain
has
been
inspected
in
transit
has
not
been
because
of
the
grain
standards
act.
it
has
been
because
this
is
the
place
to
do
it.
this
is
where
the
market
is,
this
is
the
condition
of
a
grain
on
a
day
that
it
is
sold
on
a
market
and
this
is
where
the
impartial
inspection
is
available.
the
change
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
no,
it
shipped
to
the
market.
it
will
go
from
a
country
elevated
to
the
market
say
to
omaha
for
instructions
and
re-consignment.
after
the
inspection
is
made
then
whoever
buys
the
grains
says
well,
ship
it
to
chicago
or
something
like
that.
you
do
not
know
who
is
going
to
buy
the
grain
until
it
is
inspected,
that
is
the
whole
idea.
in
other
words,
when
you
bring
it
to
central
grain
exchange,
they
can
bring
that
sample
before
the
board
of
trade
and
people
all
over
the
country,
all
of
the
world
can
bid
on
that
grain
and
in
effect
the
farmers
getting
the
benefit
of
this
total
market.
the
other
way
to
go
always
for
the
farmer
to
ship
his
grain
to
omaha
to
one
of
the
handful
--
maybe
half
a
dozen
elevators
that
are
located
there.
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
those
people,
he
has
to
sell
to
them.
the
other
way
he
can
go
now
is
to
ship
it
in
there
and
have
it
inspected
and
pay
the
$17,
in
which
case
he
is
paying
$17
extra
a
car
was
something
that
he
has
always
done
and
which
is
already
paid
for
under
the
line
haul
rate
itself.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well,
i
think
the
alternative
that
many
people
have
suggested
is
that
if
the
railroads
are
really
concerned
about
giving
the
shippers
an
incentive
to
eliminate
the
grain
inspection,
the
thing
for
them
to
do
would
be
to
reduce
their
rates.
in
other
words,
let
us
say
the
rate
is
$0.20
from
a
point
in
nebraska
at
omaha.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
the
carrier
has
no
interest
in
the
quality
of
grain,
however,
by
providing
a
service
which
is
of
value,
he
is
enhancing
the
attractiveness
of
the
railroad
service,
but
the
point
is
that
the
carriers,
when
they
made
the
$0.20
rate
for
example,
they
put
into
that
rate
$0.2
specifically
because
of
the
cost
of
the
grain
inspection,
this
was
stipulated
in
the
record.
if
the
rate
was
not
a
full
service
rate,
if
the
rate
did
not
include
the
grain
inspection,
that
rate
would
be
$0.18.
so
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is
if
they
want
to
give
them
an
incentive,
let
us
do
what
they
should
do.
they
can
not
take
away
the
service
and
continue
the
charge
us
the
full
$0.20.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well,
if
you
are
talking
about
the
$17
per
car
charge,
the
$17
approximates
what
it
costs
--
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
they
are
always
not
losing
money
on
grain
traffic.
they
are
making
a
very
substantial
profit.
for
example,
somebody
put
some
evidence
in
that
on
the
whole,
they
are
making
150%
of
the
direct
cost.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
am
trying
to
get
your
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
now,
he
has
not
said
that
he
is
losing
money
on
inspection
process.
what
he
has
said
is
that
part
of
the
total
transportation
as
has
existed
has
been
a
portion
in
the
middle
whereby
the
grain
has
been
inspected
and
takes
three
days
to
do
that
and
he
said
they
are
occupying
our
cars
for
three
days.
now,
if
we
can
put
something
new
in
the
tariff,
that
will
discourage
that,
eliminate
it,
then
we
can
free
up
more
cars
and
alleviate
to
some
extent
the
grain
car
shortage,
this
is
the
basic
proposition
on
which
they
present
this
case
to
the
icc.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor
because
if
they
want
to
do
that,
they
would
have
proposed
and
said,
as
from
tomorrow,
we
will
not
form
any
grain
inspections,
regardless
of
price.
they
have
not
done
that.
they
said,
we
will
continue
to
perform
grain
inspections,
but
we
will
do
it
at
an
additional
cost
of
$17
in
addition
to
our
rates
which
already
pay
us
once
for
that.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well,
they
are
competing
with
other
modes
of
transportation.
railroads
are
not
the
only
way
to
route
this
grain
and
by
having
this
grain
inspection
and
allowing
the
grain
to
come
to
the
market
in
a
car,
the
man
in
the
field,
the
farmer,
he
has
an
opportunity
of
bringing
his
grain
to
market
and
getting
a
price
on
a
competitive
market.
now
the
other
way
he
can
go
is
he
can
put
on
a
truck
and
he
can
send
it
to
market
but
if
he
does
that,
he
is
not
going
to
get
the
same
market
structure.
he
is
not
going
to
have
the
advantage
of
a
nationwide
buyers,
he
is
going
to
get
less
money.
for
example,
he
could
have
a
lower
truck
rate
than
the
rail
rate
and
this
many
times
happens
and
he
can
ship
by
rail
nevertheless
at
a
higher
price
because
when
he
gets
to
the
market,
he
is
going
to
have
the
advantage
of
the
marketplace.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
the
inspection
helps
the
carrier
to
get
grain
on
his
railroad
instead
of
having
that
grain
go
down
the
river
on
the
barge,
instead
of
going
by
truck.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
yes
your
honor
we
object
it
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
he
is
destroying
the
marketing
structure
which
we
have
built
up
over
50
years.
he
is
putting
a
lot
of
people
out
of
business
that
are
involved
in
this
thing.
the
second
thing
that
he
is
doing
is
he
is
saying
to
us,
i
am
going
to
take
the
service
away
from
you
and
as
i
continue
to
charge
you
a
rate
which
includes
a
specific
cost
of
that
service.
we
would
have
a
much
different
case,
if
they
were
here
saying,
we
took
our
rates
and
we
took
two
cents
off,
we
have
published
upper
grades.
now
this
is
what
has
happened
in
the
past,
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
at
such
cross
roads.
in
the
past
where
the
railroads
wanted
to
put
rates
in
without
inspection,
they
have
reduced
their
rate.
they
have
said
we
will
drop
from
$0.20
to
$0.18.
we
will
now
give
you
an
$0.18
rate
which
you
can
use
without
grain
inspection.
we
will
give
you
an
incentive
and
this
is
what
has
happened
and
now
all
of
a
sudden,
they
have
switched
into
this
new
position.
they
want
to
take
away
the
grain
inspection
and
they
want
to
keep
the
higher
rates
which
compensate
them
for
it
and
they
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
if
they
want
to
go
down
this
other
road,
if
they
want
to
come
back
next
week,
they
can
publish
a
new
tariff
and
say,
every
rate
in
the
west
shall
be
$0.2
lower
whenever
a
grain
inspection
is
weighed.
this
is
a
way
that
they
could
have
gone.
they
could
have
avoided
all
these
problems.
they
could
have
solved
the
car
supply
problem
that
they
have
been
talking
about
that
it
said
that
they
want,
but
they
did
not
want
to
do
that.
they
wanted
to
add
a
charge
so
that
the
man
who
takes
the
grain
inspection
has
to
pay
for
it
once
in
the
rate
and
secondly
with
the
$17
and
the
man
who
was
prevented
from
doing
it
because
he
says,
i
do
not
want
to
add
another
$17,
he
still
pays
the
old
rate
which
included
the
compensation.
so
that
people
that
are
using
the
inspection
are
being
deprived
because
they're
paying
double,
people
who
don't
use
the
inspection
are
being
deprived
of
the
service
that
they're
paying
for
right
now
today.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
it
certainly
is
your
honor.
it's
increasing
the
total
charges
and
in
effect
it's
increasing
the
line
haul
rate
indirectly
by
reducing
the
service.
you
still
pay
the
same
price
but
you
get
a
service
more.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well,
it's
selected,
your
honor,
as
we
figure
they've
collected
between
four
and
five
million
dollars
a
year
on
this
so
they've
been
getting
money
on
this.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
find
that
paradoxical.
i
think
if
they
were
really
sincere
and
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
get
this
goal
of
helping
the
car
supply,
they
would
come
out
with
a
very
straightforward
proposition.
they
would
say
we're
going
to
knock
two
cents
off
every
rate.
as
of
tomorrow,
if
you
don't
take
your
inspection,
you're
going
to
save
two
cents.
this
is
what
i
call
an
incentive.
what
they've
been
calling
an
incentive
is
actually
a
penalty.
they're
saying
you're
already
paying
for
it
once,
tomorrow
you're
going
to
pay
for
it
twice.
we
can't
go
along
with
that.
unfortunately,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
did.
now,
we
get
to
the
question
of
why
are
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decisions
renewed
at
all
by
courts.
the
reason
is,
because
congress
put
statutes
and
they
said
you
can
interpret
these
statutes
and
you
can
apply
them
to
the
facts,
but
you
can't
do
it
arbitrarily
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
have
an
arbitrary
decision.
we
have
decision
where
the
commission
was
overwhelmed
with
all
this
evidence
and
repetitive
testimony,
all
this
legislative
history
from
the
grain
standards
act
about
how
important
car
supply
is,
and
how
this
thing
is
going
to
help
car
supply.
so
the
commissioners
are
sitting
there
and
they've
got
letters
in
their
files,
they've
got
complaints,
they've
got
people
criticizing
them
in
the
newspapers
about
the
car
supply.
really,
the
problem
is
that
the
railroads
just
don't
buy
enough
cars
to
replace
the
old
ones.
in
the
last
15
years,
they've
dropped
300,000
box
cars,
they
used
to
have
over
600,000.
now
we've
got
300,000
plus.
so
when
they
talk
about
a
saving
here,
300,000
cars
a
year
or
600,000
cars
a
year,
this
is
not
the
solution
to
the
car
shortage
problem.
it's
a
small
step
in
that
direction,
but
it's
not
the
great
solution
as
presented.
so
the
commission
looked
up
and
they
said,
well
this
is
a
car
supply
case,
we're
going
to
approve
this
thing
and
at
that
point
they
said
we
are
not
going
to
follow
the
statute
and
we're
not
going
to
look
at
this
pile
of
evidence
over
here.
we,
at
the
commission
know
well
enough,
what's
good
for
the
public,
what's
good
for
the
railroad's
car
supply.
we
don't
have
to
look
at
statute
then
we
have
to
look
to
the
merits
of
the
decision
with
this
background,
because
this
is
really
the
background
on
which
the
commission
decided
the
case.
when
the
commission
came
here,
in
a
jurisdictional
statement
they
specifically
said
to
this
court
that
they
were
not
going
to
ask
the
court
to
review
the
merits
of
their
decision.
apparently
at
that
time,
when
they
first
came
here
they
were
convinced
that
they
couldn't
defend
their
decision.
in
the
last
few
months
something
has
happened.
they
filed
a
brief
and
they're
now
trying
to
defend
themselves
on
the
merits.
i'm
not
going
to
question
their
right
to
do
that,
but
i
think
it
does
show
a
little
bit
that
there
was
certain
lack
of
confidence
in
their
own
decision.
what
do
you
have
to
prove
in
a
case
like
this?
you
have
to
prove
that
the
changes,
in
the
rates
and
charges
are
just
and
reasonable.
this
is
section
15(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now
one
bar
is
on
thing,
when
you
have
concepts
of
just
and
reasonable,
it's
somewhat
vague
and
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
well,
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
particular
act,
congress
put
in
specific
standards
that
the
commission
shall
consider
in
determining
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
the
standards
are
in
15
(a)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
one
thing
is
that
they
must
show
that
the
rates
are
at
the
lowest
cost
consistent
with
the
total
services
and
the
other
thing
is,
they
have
to
show
the
effect
on
the
movement
of
the
traffic,
whether
or
not
the
traffic
would
be
diverted.
so
the
commission
then
has
to
come
to
grips
with
the
situation.
more
specifically
within
three
months
before
these
tariffs
were
published,
the
district
court
in
ohio
had
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
icc
in
the
transit
charges
case,
which
was
the
same
kind
of
a
situation.
the
southern
railroads
decided
that
we've
been
providing
transit
on
cotton
for
long
time
at
the
line
haul
rate.
we
will
now
add
a
charge
of
something
like
$50
a
car
for
it.
that
case
went
before
the
icc
and
the
icc
decided,
one
you
have
got
to
present
costs
for
the
through
movement,
show
us
how
much
it
cost
to
handle
this
traffic,
how
much
your
cost
is
for
the
transit
and
give
us
your
total
revenue
and
your
total
cost,
otherwise
we
can't
determine
the
overall
reasonableness
of
your
proposal.
the
other
thing
i
said
is
that
there
would
be
a
likelihood
that
you're
going
to
lose
lot
of
traffic
to
the
trucks
if
you
raise
your
rate
like
this.
that
case
went
to
the
district
court
in
ohio,
and
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
and
then
went
to
this
court
and
was
affirmed.
so
here
we're
starting
out
and
we're
going
to
trial
in
this
case
and
the
railroads
have
got
to
prove
these
things.
yet,
they
put
in
no
evidence
whatsoever
on
these
issues
and
this
is
how
the
case
comes
to
the
commission
and
they
are
sitting,
trying
to
write
a
report
which
is
going
to
find
these
rates
just
and
reasonable
when
the
railroads
have
put
no
evidence
in
on
two
issues
that
are
spelled
out
by
section
15
(a)
(2).
well,
they
had
quite
a
job
on
the
hand
trying
to
do
that.
here
is
how
they
went
about
it.
they
said
well,
we
don't
have
to
follow
the
principles
of
the
southern
transit
case,
which
incidentally
are
the
statutory
principles.
they
said,
this
case
is
different
from
the
southern
transit
case
where
we
said
you
have
to
have
total
cost
with
the
total
movement
and
show
us
how
much
money
you're
making
on
this
traffic
before
we're
going
to
let
you
tack
a
charge
on
top
of
it.
so
they
said,
well,
in
this
case,
we've
got
thousands
of
rates
in
a
wide
area.
where
we've
got
a
big
job
on
our
hands
like
this,
well
it's
just
too
much
to
ask
railroads
to
supply
with
cars.
we
shouldn't
have
to
do
that.
well,
of
course,
the
southern
transit
case
involved
rates
throughout
the
south
and
involved
all
the
railroads
and
involved
thousands
of
rates.
so
this
distinction
was
i
would
say
specious
at
this
point.
i
don't
know
how
stronger
these
people
are
defending
that
in
this
case.
they
talk
about
it
as
a
dictum,
they
walk
away,
it's
virtually
a
dictum.
this
court
many
years
ago
in
the
(inaudible)
divisions
case
said
that
there
are
means
of
meeting
it
when
you've
got
thousands
of
rates
involved,
present
typical
evidence
and
there
was
some
kind
of
a
sample,
show
us
representative
rates
and
that's
good
enough.
this
is
how
the
business
of
the
commission
is
carried
on.
everyday,
all
the
day
we've
got
cases
involving
thousands
of
rates.
nobody
throws
up
their
hands
and
says
there
is
thousands
of
rates,
they
don't
put
any
evidence.
that's
not
true
at
all,
where
you've
got
thousands
of
rates,
the
justification
and
necessity
for
putting
in
these
costs
required
by
the
statute
is
even
greater,
because
there
is
more
people
affected
by
a
case
like
this.
they
could
have
broken
this
case
into
50
different
cases,
let
each
railroad
try
their
own
case.
it
would
be
that
much
less
rates
in
each
one,
but
because
they
all
come
together
and
all
simultaneously
try
to
put
this
thing
across.
it
doesn't
take
out
of
the
statute
and
leave
him
from
the
statutory
burden
of
proof.
the
other
way
that
commission
went
on
this
point
is
they
said,
well,
we
find
that
way
back
in
1934
issued
a
decision
on
grain
rates
and
in
that
case
we
looked
very
closely
and
we
decided
what
a
reasonable
level
of
rate
would
be.
now
if
we
take
those
rates,
and
add
to
it,
every
single
general
increase
we've
had
in
the
last
40
years,
we
will
find
that
that
total
rate
is
still
higher
than
what
the
shippers
would
get
here
if
they
add
the
$17
on
top
of
the
rates
that
they're
paying
today.
what
had
happened
is
that
the
1934
rates
have
become
obsolete.
they
no
longer
move
the
grain
traffic
today.
if
these
were
the
only
rates
that
we
have
in
the
tariffs,
the
grain
traffic
wouldn't
move
by
rail
at
all.
it
would
either
be
uneconomic
or
the
barges
and
the
trucks
would
get
it
on.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
these
rates
are
as
high
as
the
sky.
so
the
commission
said,
well,
we've
got
that,
and
as
long
as
the
railroads
haven't
exceeded
those
rates,
which
their
principle
witness
said,
are
paper
rates
don't
move
any
traffic,
as
long
as
they
don't
like
see
those
rates,
we
find
that,
this
is
alright.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
would
treat
that
as
a
conclusion
rather
than
a
finding.
the
findings
that
are
required
on
the
section
15
(a)
(2),
the
commission
shall
consider
the
relationship
between
the
costs
and
the
revenue.
now
instead
of
doing
what
they're
supposed
to
do
on
the
15
(a)
(2),
they
off
into
the
wide
blue
yonder
and
they
say,
well,
we'll
consider
the
fact
that
these
rates
are
not
higher
than
the
1934
rates
plus
a
150%
over
the
last
40
years.
they
did
not
do
what
the
statute
said.
we
don't
deny
that
they
have
the
right
to
throw
this
kind
of
language
into
report
and
say
well,
these
rates
are
no
higher
than
the
1934
rates
plus
a
150%,
but
that
doesn't
excuse
them
in
anyway,
from
fulfilling
their
function
under
15
(a)
(2),
which
says,
you
shall
consider
the
costs
and
the
revenues.
they
have
to
consider
the
costs
and
the
revenues
today.
this
is
what
it's
all
about.
what's
happening
today?
how
much
does
it
cost
in
the
handle
of
traffic
today?
they
can't
just
simply
say
we've
got
res
judicata,
we've
got
a
rate
that
was
decided
four
years
ago.
there
is
no
res
judicata
in
administrative
law
and
commission
cases.
they've
got
to
come
in.
they've
got
to
get
evidence.
they've
got
to
decide
it
on
the
facts.
they
have
to
know
how
much
profit
are
the
railroads
making
on
these
rates
today.
can
they
afford
to
reduce
the
rate
and
give
them
a
reduced
scale
of
rates
instead
of
adding
something
on
top
of
them,
on
top
of
rates
in
many
cases
which
are
rather
high.
they
try
to
get
off
the
hook.
they
try
to
walk
away
from
the
statute,
or
refine
to
an
old
decision.
now
if
you
stay
with
that
for
a
moment,
let's
say
they
prescribed
the
rates
of
1934,
10
cents,
that
rate
today
is
say
25
cents.
it's
gone
up
150%.
there
was
never
any
prescription
by
the
commission
that
25
cent
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
in
order
to
bridge
this
tremendous
leap
from
a
10
cent
rate
to
a
25
cent
rate,
the
commission
said,
well,
over
the
years
those
cases
have
gone
up
in
this
general
increase
cases
and
therefore
every
time
we
got
any
general
increase
case,
this
rate
now
becomes
a
new
maximum
reasonable
rate.
well,
that
isn't
true
at
all.
they
have
been
taken
to
court
after
general
increase
cases
where
shippers
and
groups
of
shippers
have
ask
the
court
to
review
and
say,
our
rates
are
unjust
and
unreasonable
with
this
5%
increase.
the
commission
and
the
railroads
say,
that's
not
involved
here.
the
level
of
the
rates
and
whether
they
are
just
and
reasonable
is
not
involved
in
our
general
increase
cases.
all
we
are
looking
for
in
general
case
is
a
total
piece
of
money.
we
need
$15
million,
you
could
buy
this
year
and
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates
on
grain,
the
rates
of
potatoes,
the
rates
automobiles
are
just
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
this
court
sustained
a
decision
of
a
district
court
on
exactly
that
point
that
you
can
even
get
a
review
of
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates
established
in
these
general
increase
cases.
now
they
want
to
have
the
other
side
of
the
coin
and
come
back
here
and
say,
oh,
yes,
these
rates
are
just
and
reasonable.
they
were
established
in
a
general
increase
cases
as
just
and
reasonable.
those
two
concepts
cannot
live
together.
there
is
no
room
for
both
of
those
things
do
exist
side-by-side.
if
they
found
them
just
and
reasonable,
then
they
should
really
review
it.
i
don't
see
how
they
could
find
it
just
and
reasonable,
they
never
looked
at
them,
all
they
look
at
in
those
general
increase
cases
is
the
total
revenue
need
of
the
railroads.
so
they
need
5%
more
money
and
if
they
find
that
they
do
it,
they'll
give
it
to
them.
i
want
to
say
just
something
on
this
arrow
case
and
we
have
here
a
special
situation
and
all
the
talk
about
possible
refunds
gives
us
no
help
at
all.
these
people
have
put
in
a
charge
which
they
want
to
be
a
barrier.
they
have
come
into
this
court
to
say
that
since
the
charge
went
in,
50%
of
these
inspections
no
longer
take
place.
so
that
on
the
shipments
which
they
have
precluded,
nobody
is
going
to
get
a
refund
of
$17
a
car
on
a
shipment
that
wasn't
inspected
because
the
charge
was
so
high
that
nobody
could
use
it.
on
the
other
50%
what
happened
to
the
charge
is
that
it
was
passed
onto
the
farmer.
when
the
purchase
was
made
from
the
farmer
they
deduct
the
freight
rate
and
the
$17
a
car,
that's
taken
right
away
from
him.
he
is
not
a
party
to
the
transportation
with
the
railroad,
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
shipment.
he
will
never
get
that
$17
back.
everyday
that
this
case
goes
on
without
restoring
the
district
court's
decree,
the
farmer
is
loosing
$17
on
every
car
that
is
inspected.
the
other
way
he
loses
is
that
he
is
losing
his
market.
he
can't
get
this
nationwide
market
that
we
have
been
providing
him.
so
we
have
people
going
out
of
business.
we
have
grain
inspectors
that
have
been
fired,
we
have
this
whole
system
of
marketing
through
grain
inspection
which
is
being
gradually
destroyed
and
taken
apart
while
the
litigation
goes
forward
and
the
railroads
understandably
and
the
icc,
not
quite
so
understandably
say
that
no
one
can
do
anything
about
it
and
they
rely
upon
arrow
case
which
said
that
we
don't
want
single
judge
courts
doing
a
job
before
the
icc
decision
which
can
only
be
done
by
three-judge
courts
under
the
statute
after
an
icc
decision.
we
summit
that
the
railroads
lose
a
case,
they
can
go
to
court
get
the
commission
set
aside
and
then
they
can
put
their
rates
in.
on
the
other
hand,
the
shipper
should
have
the
same
power.
they
should
have
the
same
right.
they
shouldn't
be
just
going
to
court
to
touch
bases
and
to
go
back
to
the
icc
again.
they
should
be
able
to
get
some
substantial
relief
while
the
case
was
back
to
the
icc.
bearing
in
mind
particularly
that
it
isn't
necessary
for
the
court
to
say
this
is
just
and
reasonable
or
it's
not
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
because
arrow
concerned
itself
with
what
could
take
place
before
the
decision
of
the
commission?
what
would
happen
if
the
commission
doesn't
makes
its
decision
within
a
seven
month
suspension,
but
takes
them
a
year?
what
happens
in
that
five
months
before
the
commission
has
discharged
that
function
and
they
said
we
do
not
think
that
the
court
should
be
taking
a
crack
at
this
kind
of
case
before
the
commission
and
its
primary
jurisdiction,
has
completed
the
record
and
has
made
its
findings.
at
that
point
as
it
was
noted
in
the
footnote
the
case
belongs
to
the
three
judge
courts,
it's
up
to
them
to
decide
and
it's
up
to
them
to
decide
whether
the
situation
is
such
that
they
have
to
grant
some
kind
of
ancillary
relief
and
we
asked
that
court
to
grant
us
ancillary
relief.
we
didn't
have
some
grant,
the
specific
relief
that
they
did,
but
we
asked
them
to
order
the
icc
on
remand
to
immediately
have
this
rates
canceled.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
well
the
status
quo,
your
honor,
is
the
last
piece
of
those
status
prior
to
litigation.
in
this
case,
that
was
prior
to
the
publication
of
the
rates,
prior
to
this
controversy
arising
there
was
no
inspection
charge.
now
because
they
had
succeeded
in
maneuvering
this
case
that
by
the
time,
they
got
to
the
courthouse
the
rates
have
been
in
for
a
few
months.
it
doesn't
change
the
court's
right
to
restore
the
status
quo,
the
status
quo
that
existed
before
the
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
sweeney
i
don't
think
that
affects
rate
making
one
way
or
the
other
i
think
for
a
court
to
issue
an
injunction
like
they
did
here,
all
they
are
saying
is
that
you
are
required
on
the
16,
section
15
(7)
to
fulfill
a
burden
of
proof
of
showing
the
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
the
district
court
below
found
the
statutory
requirements
that
the
railroads
had
to
put
in
cost.
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record.
the
railroads
had
failed
to
meet
the
burden
of
proof
and
all
of
the
district
court
was
saying
is
since
you've
failed
to
meet
your
burden
of
proof
in
a
case
in
which
you
had
ample
of
time
to
do
so,
as
of
this
date
you
have
no
further
right
to
keep
those
rates
in.
without
prejudice
to
down
the
road
perhaps
the
icc
will
give
them
another
hearing,
perhaps
some
decisions,
some
valid
decisions
will
be
issued
some
day
that
will
approve
this.
but
in
the
mean
time,
the
life
of
these
rates
as
of
september
1971,
when
the
icc
issued
it's
decision,
was
critically
dependent
upon
whether
or
not
the
icc
found
that
they
had
fulfilled
their
burden
of
proof
and
if
they
didn't
fulfill
the
burden
of
proof
as
of
the
next
day,
they
have
no
right
to
be
in
effect
and
the
court
is
in
effect
saying
you
made
a
mistake,
you
didn't
follow
the
law
and
therefore
these
rates
have
to
go
out,
until
such
time
as
you
fulfill
your
obligation
and
prove
that
they
are
just
and
reasonable.
thank
you.
