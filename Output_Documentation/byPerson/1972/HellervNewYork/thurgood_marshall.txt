justice
thurgood

assuming
that
they
follow
this
procedure
and
they
seize
the
man
who
was
showing
the
film
who
is
the
owner
and
he
is
also
the
operator,
and
you
have
this
full
adversary
hearing
and
you
lose
there,
and
you
have
a

trial--
you
have
the
trial
and
you
waive
the
jury.
please
tell
me
the
difference
between
the
first
hearing
and
the
second.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
talking
about
what
happens.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
my
case
there’s
no
question
the
man
showed
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
the
second
case,
what
other
evidence
would
you
put
in?
the
fact
that
he
shown--
that
he
showed
the
film?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
would
you
put
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
do
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
shows
that
they
went
in
the
place
and
they
found
the
man
up
in
the
place
in
the
projection
room
running
the
camera
and
they
also
saw
him
picking
up
the
money
and
there
was
nobody
there
but
him.
now,
what
else
do
you
have
to
show?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he’s
already
testified
in
the
other
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wasn’t?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
in
this--
my
hypothetical,
they
start
this
adversary
hearing
the
day
after
the
picture
is
shown,
adversary
hearing,
and
the
other
hypothetical
is
they
start
his
trial
on
the
merits
the
day
after
the
hearing.
the
difference
being,
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
practical
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
we’re
worried
about,
isn’t
this
just
like
some
narcotics
cases
when
you,
as
defense
counsel,
you
lose
the
motion
to
suppress,
you
lose
your
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
i’m
going
to
practical.
i
said,
practical.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
wouldn’t
push
you
a
number.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
those
that
i--
i
limited
mine
to
that
because
i
don’t
think
the
others
apply.
i
still--
i’m
unconvinced
of
the
difference
between
these
two
when
you
ins--
i
only
limited
my
questions
that
you
insist
that
there’d
be
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
that
prevents
you
from
going
down
at
the
district
attorney
from
going
from
judge
to
judge,
through
about
30
judges
until
he
finds
one
that
agrees
with
him?
is
there
anything
to
stop
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
justified
this
on
the
fact
that,
i
think
i
heard
you
correctly,
that
if
it’s
found
out
that
it
was
obscene
then
that
makes
everything
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
i
mean--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
i
thought
you
shared--
what
prompted
my
question
was
that
once
the
hearing
does
determine
that
the
picture
is
obscene,
however
it
was
seized
and
under
whatever
conditions,
it’s
nothing
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
not
my
idea
of
search
and
seizure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
fact--
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
a
minute,
on
search
and
seizure,
if
you
make
an
illegal
search
and
you
find
a
million
pounds
of
the
purest
of
heroin
in
the
world.
the
fact
that
it’s
pure
heroin
doesn’t
protect
it,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that--
do
you
want
to
make
that
true
here
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you’re
vindicating
the
seizure
of
property
which
allegedly
is
under
first
amendment
protection.
justice
thurgood
marshall
allegedly.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
obscene
under
the
state
law
of
new
york.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
sound
instead
to
give
a
proof
of
what
you’re
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
can’t
we
have
this
hearing,
other
than
the
fact
that
it
takes
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
other
than
the
fact
that
it
takes
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
go
through
any
hearing?
why
don’t
you
just
go
and
seize
it?
they
did
go
through
the
trouble
of
getting
the
magistrate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
all
you
say
is
true,
why’d
you
worry
about
getting
the
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
you
can--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
man
has
been
without
this
film
for
how
long
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
huh?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
doesn’t
give
any
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
apply
to
a
book?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
apply
to
a
book?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
it
was
the
only
book?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
was
the
only
copy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
seized--
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
it
could
be
kept
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
destroyed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
gives
you
no
first
amendment
problems?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mind
if
it
gives
me
some?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
wouldn’t
have
that
problem
in
the
case
we
had
earlier
because
somebody
destroyed
it.
we
could
just
go
down
the
street
here
in
washington
and
see
it.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
it
some
place
in
brooklyn
that
has
this
“library”
on
it?
is
it
the
federal
or
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
need
to
use
the
word
“library.”[laughter]
