mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
if
this
were,
in
fact,
the
only
copy
of
this
film
in
existence
that
it
would
not
be
such
a
unique
composition
that
it
would’ve
been
made
the
subject
of
some
inquiry
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
very
many
films
of
which
there
is
only
one
copy
in
this
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
wouldn’t
be
much
profit
in
it
if
there
were
only
copy,
would
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
had
to
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you’re
saying
is
that
there
must
be
a
full-scale
adversary
criminal
trial
to
determine
whether
there
should
be
a
full-scale
adversary
criminal
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
that
what
you’re
arguing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there’s
no
escape
from
it,
is
there?
on
your
position,
you
want
a
trial
to
see
whether
there
should
be
a
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
you’re
backing
away
from
your
ammos
to
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
don’t
let
my
questions
mislead
you.
i
just
want
your
answers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
when
you
come
to
the
later
trial,
how
is
the
state
going
to
meet
its
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
the
film
brought
in
at
the
trial
is
the
same
film
they
had--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
preliminary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
make
copies.
you
can
do
a
lot
of
things.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
each
exhibition
is
a
new
crime,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
there
a
solution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
there
a
solution
to
go
to
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
there’s
a
due
process
right
as
to--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman,
is
there’s
a
due
process
right
to
some
kind
of
a
hearing,
adversary
or
otherwise,
do
you
suggest
that
that
right
can
yield
to
the
fact
that
some
judges
in
new
york
don’t
get
on
with
the
trial
of
their
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
return
it
to
the
defendant.
chief

who’s
in

of
the
