justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
you
mean,
an
adversary
hearing
to
determine
obscenity
del
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
just
probable
cause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
the
only
print?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
clear
too
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
how
will
we
assume
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
like
the
picture
in
the
previous
cases,
it’s
also
showing
in
washington?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don’t
think
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
print,
what,
in
existence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn’t--
shouldn’t
there
be
another
question
of
whether
there’s
more
than
one
print
that
might
be
available
to
this
man?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
clear
in
the--
is
that
clear
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
appreciate
why
we’re
asking
all
those
questions
to
call
in
both
quantity
of
books
and
marcus.
end--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
end
result
there
was
to
take
everything
out
right
of
the
circulation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
you
wouldn’t
even
have
to
argue
it
if
we--
the
record
show
that,
actually,
this
was
the
only
print
in
existence,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
kind
of
film
that’s--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
does
it
run
the
ordinary
booking
procedures?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
as
war
hole?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
whether
that’s
a
standard
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
anolik.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
talk
about
adversary
hearing,
what
do
you
concede
this
to
be?
i
gather,
certainly
one
element
has
to
be
and
there
has
to
be
a
judicial
determination
that
the
film
is
or
is
not
obscene.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
for
that
purpose,
what
kinds
of
proof
would
the
city
have
to
use
and
what
kind
of
proofs
and
defense
would
you
use?
would
this
be
a
full-scale
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
full-scale
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you’re
talking
about
a
determination
going
on.
i
suppose,
nothing
short
of
that--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
suffice,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
that
mean?
that
you
could
introduce
all
kinds
of
expert
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bearing
on--
the
city
would
have
to
prove
obscenity.
is
this
a
city
or
a--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
state?
and,
the
state
would
have
to--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
obscenity
in
the
first
instance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
by
what,
preponderance
or--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
beyond
reasonable
doubt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
not
because
the
object
of
seizing
the
film
is
to
get
evidence
to
support
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that.
i’m
interested
why
you
suggest
it
has
to
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
is
it
that
it’s
connected
with
a
possible
criminal
prosecution
or
even
if
it
isn’t,
you’d
still
say
that
it
had
to
be
unreasonable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
i
take
it,
if
the
tryer
applied
beyond
reasonable
doubt
standard
and
then
they--
and
determined
obscenity
and
then
a
criminal
prosecution
ensued,
you’d
still
insist
the
state
had
over
again,
in
the
criminal
trial,
to
prove
obscenity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
still,
the
st--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
standard
for
the
decision
of
the
jury
would
have
to
be
obscenity
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily,
does
he
get
more
than
one
print?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
sort
of
distribution
method
this
film
was
subject
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
that--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn’t
mean
much
if
there’s
not
a
second
print
available
to
this
exhibitor,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
mr.
anolik
suggested
to
us
earlier
that
because
of
some
decisions
of
the
second
circuit
you
are
actually
providing
an
adversary
hearing.
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
form
did
they
take?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
this--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
whom,
a
magistrate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
you
saying
there’d
been
two
other
instances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
different
or
are
they
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
kind
of
case--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
time
of
case--
or
what
kind
of
case
did
the
state
put
in,
in
this
first
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
but
the
film?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
rested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
defense
put
on
expert
testimony,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
guess,
he’s
entitled
to
some
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
for
your
state
judges,
isn’t
it,
not
for
the
rest
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
that
procedure--
is
it
still
obtained
in
new
york
when
we
have
in
king--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
kingsley
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn’t
that
require
a
hearing
within
a
day
or
something
and
a
decision
within
two
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know,
but
is
that
still--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
recall,
that
one--
doesn’t
that--
that
requires
a
hearing
within
what,
one
day
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
take
it
if
they--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
ask
for
more
time
and
the
court
grants
it,
that’s
too
bad
to
the
state
but
that’s
hitting
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
some
reason--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
some
reason,
mr.
friedman,
now
that
you’ve
amended
that
kingsberg--
was
it
kings--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
kingsley
books
statute,
is
there
any
reason
you
don’t
resort
to
that
instead
of
this
type
of
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
a
good
reason.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
an
injunction
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
an
injunction
procedure,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
on
the
ground
that
if
there’s
a
determination
of
obscenity
that
takes
it
outside
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
it
could
be
treated
as
without
or--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
it’s
contraband,
in
any
event--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
new
york
statute
have
any
provision
for
destruction
of
material
when
finally
adjudicated
obscene?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
other
than--
i
mean--
even
after--
i’m
just
interested.
after
the
adjudication,
and
what’s
the
basis
upon
which--
of
course,
it
may
be
treated,
as
we
agreed
without,
as
now,
no
longer
entitled
to
any
first
amendment
consideration
at
all
when
finally
adjudicated,
but
how
does
that
still
entitle
you
to
keep
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think,
usually--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
usually,
these
statutes
provide
for
its
destruction
in
that
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
when
it’s--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
it’s
heroin
or
something
like
that,
isn’t
there
some
statutory
provision
in
which
you
keep
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it’s
contraband,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
destroy
it,
you
don’t
know
whether
that’s
done
under
statutory
authority
or
just--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
word
“adversary”
has
appeared
first
in
marcus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
ordinarily
connotes,
doesn’t
it,
a
contest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
you’re
doing
now
with
the
magistrate
going
to
the
theater,
that--
there’s
no--
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
contest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
to
that
extent,
if
the
principle
of
marcus
and
quantity
of
books
applies
in
this
situation,
to
that
extent,
surely
your
procedure
is
deficient.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
here,
there’s
no
contest
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
the
contest
may
be,
i
just
suggest
that
i
think
marcus
and
quantity
of
books
does
suggest
there
has
to
be
some
contest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
an
ex
parte
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
what
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
you
mean,
an
adversary
hearing
to
determine
obscenity
del
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
just

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
clear
too
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
how
will
we
assume
it?

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
like
the
picture
in
the
previous
cases,
it’s
also
showing
in
washington?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don’t
think
that
makes
a

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
print,
what,
in

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn’t--
shouldn’t
there
be
another
question
of
whether
there’s
more

that
might
be
available
to
this

justice
william

is

is
that
clear

william

but
you
appreciate
why
we’re
asking
all

do

brennan,

didn’t
that
require
a
hearing
within
a
day
or
something
and
a
decision
within
two
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know,
but
is
that
still--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
recall,
that
one--
doesn’t
that--
that
requires
a
hearing
within
what,
one
day
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
take
it
if
they--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
ask
for
more
time
and
the
court
grants
it,
that’s
too
bad
to
the
state
but
that’s
hitting
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
some
reason--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
some
reason,
mr.
friedman,
now
that
you’ve
amended
that
kingsberg--
was
it
kings--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
kingsley
books
statute,
is
there
any
reason
you
don’t
resort
to
that
instead
of
this
type
of
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
a
good
reason.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
an
injunction
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
an
injunction
procedure,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
on
the
ground
that
if
there’s
a
determination
of
obscenity
that
takes
it
outside
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
it
could
be
treated
as
without
or--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
it’s
contraband,
in
any
event--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
new
york
statute
have
any
provision
for
destruction
of
material
when
finally
adjudicated
obscene?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
other
than--
i
mean--
even
after--
i’m
just
interested.
after
the
adjudication,
and
what’s
the
basis
upon
which--
of
course,
it
may
be
treated,
as
we
agreed
without,
as
now,
no
longer
entitled
to
any
first
amendment
consideration
at
all
when
finally
adjudicated,
but
how
does
that
still
entitle
you
to
keep
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think,
usually--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
usually,
these
statutes
provide
for
its
destruction
in
that
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
when
it’s--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
it’s
heroin
or
something
like
that,
isn’t
there
some
statutory
provision
in
which
you
keep
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it’s
contraband,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
destroy
it,
you
don’t
know
whether
that’s
done
under
statutory
authority
or
just--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
word
“adversary”
has
appeared
first
in
marcus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
ordinarily
connotes,
doesn’t
it,
a
contest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
you’re
doing
now
with
the
magistrate
going
to
the
theater,
that--
there’s
no--
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
contest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
to
that
extent,
if
the
principle
of
marcus
and
quantity
of
books
applies
in
this
situation,
to
that
extent,
surely
your
procedure
is
deficient.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
here,
there’s
no
contest
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
the
contest
may
be,
i
just
suggest
that
i
think
marcus
and
quantity
of
books
does
suggest
there
has
to
be
some
contest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
an
ex
parte
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
what
it
is.
