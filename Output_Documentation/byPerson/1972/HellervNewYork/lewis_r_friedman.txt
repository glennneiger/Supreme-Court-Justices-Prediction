mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
has,
as
this
court
has
held
many
times,
a
valid
important
interest
in
the
prosecution
of
obscenity
and
the
enforcement
of
the
obscenity
laws
and
that
is
a
state
interest
which
may
be
vindicated
in
any
number
of
ways.
the
state
has
a
number
of
alternatives
opened
to
it,
and
the
court
has
also
held
that
if
there
is
an
important
governmental
interest
which
might
incidentally
limit
protected
speech
that
the
court
must
weigh
the
interest
of
the
state
on
one
hand
and
the
procedures
used
so
that
the
incidental
effects
can
be
minimized
and
that
it
is
this
tight
of
balance
that
must
be
decided
in
any
given
situation.
and,
what
have
we
here?
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
state
has
chosen
to
use
its
penal
statutes,
its
penal
provisions
which
impose
a
penalty
for
the
prior
showing
of
the
film.
that
is,
they
do
not
aim
at
the
future
showing
but
only
at
the
showing
that
occurred
at
some
point
in
the
past
at
some
act
the
defendant
has
already
performed
and,
in
the
course
of
enforcing
this
valid
state
interest
of
imposing
a
penalty
for
the
past
showing,
the
state
of
necessity
must
have
evidence.
and,
in
order
to
obtain
evidence,
there
are
two
choices
at
this
stage.
the
state,
in
a
case
of
a
film,
must
have
testi--
can
have
testimony
of
someone
who
has
seen
the
film
that
testifies
to
its
contents,
or
can
have
the
film.
now,
if
a
person
who
has
seen
the
film
tries
to
testify,
the
problems
of
proof
are,
in
many
cases,
overwhelming.
and
i
believe,
as
the
summary
of
evidence
which
we
have
given
in
our
brief
indicates,
any
testimony
concerning
blue
movie
would
have
been
very
hard
to
discern
by
the
tryer
of
fact.
it
is
a
type
of
movie
which
can
be
seen
in
its
entirety,
as
it--
sorry,
which
must
be
seen
in
its
entirety
as
the
only
way
to
ascertain
what
this
movie
is.
the
description
is
very
difficult
to
do
and,
i
say,
even
counsel,
with
great
deal
of
leisure,
have
had
difficulty
attempting
to
summarize
it
in
any
useful
form.
now,
given
this
problem,
why
should
the
state
be
relegated
to
less
than
the
best
available
probative
evidence
of
a
crime?
why
must
the
state
rely
on
secondary
evidence
which
is
really,
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
worthless?
because,
in
this
case,
i
would
submit
that
a
finder
of
fact
would
have
had
almost
impossible
task
in
figuring
out
what
blue
movie
is
about.
now,
they
say
the
state
has
chosen
the
penal
sanction,
and
i
mention
that
because
that
distinguishes,
in
large
part,
many
of
the
prior
cases
in
this
court
where
states
have
tried
a
civil
injunctive
remedy.
that
is
where
the
state
has
attempted
to
prevent
future
showing.
what
we
are
doing
here
is
enforcing
a
right
against
past
showings.
now,
it
is
true--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
we--
the
film
didn’t
have
to
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
in
order
to
prosecute
it.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
we
did
seize
the
film
and,
in
partial
answer
of
a
question
mr.
justice
marshall
had
asked
before,
the
film
was
currently
in
this
court’s
custody
actually.
it
was
delivered
to
the
court
by
the
district
attorney.
we
still
have
the
film,
but--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
the
subpoena
route
is
not
as
simple,
i
submit,
as
has
been
suggested
by
my
adversary.
the
subpoena
route
has
raised
many
serious
fifth
amendment
problems
where
the
perspective
defendant
is
subpoenaed
to
produce
a
document
in
his
possession
which
is
incriminating.
and,
as
a
practical
matter,
we
have
been
subjected
to
collateral
proceedings
every
time
we
ever
tried
the
subpoena
route.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
and
i
think
the
contemptor’s
power
is
not
a
very
effective
one
for
this
reason.
as
has
been
mentioned
several
times
here,
the
films
are
on
a
schedule
of
circulation
and
if
the
current
distributor--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
has
a
contract
right
which
limits
his
right
to
possession
to
a
very
limited
period
of
time,
he
may
well
have
a
defense
to
any
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
individual
distributer,
generally,
would
have
one
print,
although--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
i
presume
that
each
person
who
had
this
film
had
one
print
in
his
possession.
the
record
doesn’t
tell
us,
but
that
more
than
one
print
exists,
i
think,
is
just
facing
the
facts
of--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
commercial
distribution.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
we
don’t
know
whether
there’s
a
second
print
available
to
this
exhibitor.
we
don’t
know
what
the
terms
of
his
distribution
agreement
were.
he
never
put
any
of
this
in
the
record,
your
honor.
if
the--
if
he
was
going
to
lie
on
that
claim,
then
the
record
is--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
it
certainly
would,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
films
have
shown
in
several
theaters
even
within
the
city
and
we
have
seized
one
print
for
evidence,
but
the
problem
is
this,
and
it’s
a
very
practical
problem.
the
seizure
of
that
first
print
will
effectively
tell
any
defendant
who
is
represented
by
competent
counsel
that
perhaps
he
ought
not
to
show
the
film
in
the
future.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
but
not
because
we
are
preventing
it,
but
because
practicality
of
law
enforcement
is
that
the
penal
sanction,
having
been
invoked
as
to
one
showing,
the
man
runs
a
risk
of
subsequent
prosecution.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
where
they’re
not
subsequent
seizure.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
the
point
is,
your
honor,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
film
is
not
shown
again
even
if
he
had
a
second
print
available
would
not
necessarily
be
because
the
state
would
seize
it,
but
because
the
man
might
be
well-advised
not
to
show
it.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
but,
your
honor,
the
problem
is
this,
and
that’s
why
i
refer
to
this
case
involving
a
film
called
deep
throat
which,
i
believe,
is
referred
to
in
one
of
the
briefs
for
amicus
curiae
in
this
matter,
a
motion
in
brief
which
has
not
yet
been
accepted
by
the
court.
in
that
case,
the
defendant
has
no
incentive
in
conducting
a
hearing.
there
is
no
interest
on
this
defendant’s
part.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
they
have
this
case
come
to
a
hearing.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
our--
we
have
made
every
effort,
your
honor.
this
matter
has
been
on
the
calendar
on
six
occasions
by
my
count
and,
yet,
we
cannot
force
the
case
to
a
hearing,
but
why?
because
the
exhibitor
who
is
commercially
exploiting
the
film
will
not,
in
any
way,
cooperate
with
prosecution,
and
i
think
that
some
of
the
suggestions
made
by
my
adversary
are
perhaps
suggestions
of
fantasy
because
there
is
not
cooperation.
there
is
a
reported
case
in
the
official
reports
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
which
an
adversary
hearing
was
attempted
in
new
york
county.
that
was
our
last
attempt.
that
also
went
on
for
six
weeks.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
we
have
been
held.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
to
my
recollection,
there
had
been
three.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
the
first
one
was
in
1970.
it
went
on
through
the
summer.
we
served
the
defendant
a
notice
of
an
adversary
hearing
to
be
held
the
next
day.
the
upshot
of
that--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
six
weeks
later--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
before
a
magistrate.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
six
weeks
later,
there
were
three
days
of
testimony
given
by
defense
experts.
two
weeks
after
that,
the
judge
handed
down
an
opinion.
six
weeks
after
that,
there
was
a
motion
for
re-argument
on
the
question
of
the
prior
adversary
hearing.
our
experience
in
that
case
led
us
to
litigate
this
case.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
one
terminated
in
an
article
78--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
--
it
would
never
go
to
a
full
hearing.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
film.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
nothing
but
the
film.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
and
then
rested.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct.
in
the
third
case,
i
refer
to
as
deep
throat
which
has
not
yet
come
to
a
hearing,
we
have
tried.
indeed,
it
is
this
problem
that
faces
us
in
the
second
circuit
which
has--
which
prompted
our
office
to,
in
response
to
the
certiorari
petition,
to
suggest
the
court
hear
this
case.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
because
there
is
a
problem
in
new
york--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
our
proposition
is
this.
that
the
state
stands
ready
to
give
the
man
an
adversary
hearing
immediately,
forthwith,
on
the
seizure.
at
the
time
of
the
seizure,
the
man
is
brought
before
a
magistrate.
if
he
wants
a
hearing,
he
can
have
a
hearing
because
the
state’s
whole
case
is
available.
that
is,
the
film
is
before
the
court.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
because
i--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
justice
harlan,
in
his
dissent
in
quantity
of
books
from
market,
11
days
was
a
reasonable
time
for
a
defendant
to
request
to
prepare
a
defense.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
he’s
entitled
to
time
and
the
question
of
how
much
time.
he’s
entitled
to
counsel,
to
declaration--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
if
the
first
amendment
mandates
an
adversary
hearing,
then
i
submit
that
what
we
have
is
the
sixth
amendment
mandating
a
delayed
adversary
hearing--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
kingsley
books.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
now--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that
procedure
was
not
applicable
to
films
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
is
now.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
has
been
amended
to
be
applicable
to
films.
to
my
knowledge,
no
proceeding
under
that
section
has
been--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
and
as
the
cases
of
this
court
have
indicated,
those
hearings
also
go
on
for
months,
that,
although
the
hearings
are
required,
the
defendants
request
time
and,
in
kingsley
books,
they
consented
to
the
injunction
pendently
to
provide
time
to
prepare.
but,
our
experience
with
obscenity,
defendants
has
not
been
that
of--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
of
a
consent
to
delay.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not
in
new
york.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not
in
new
york
currently.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
believe
the
court
has
said
yes,
although
i
believe
the
current
state
of
the
law
has
been
to--
they’ve
been
repealed
in,
i
believe,
every
state
though
i
won’t--
i’m
not
sure.
they
had--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
as
a
result
of
this
courts’
decisions
which
have
cut
down
the
proceeding--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
but
in
freedman
the
court
said
that
a
temporary
removal
of
a
film
from
exhibition
for
a
limited
period,
pending
rapid
state
proceedings,
was
permissible.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
in
a
case
of
this
type,
and
that’s
what
i
see
here,
is
that
this
man
has
shown
the
film
in
the
past.
he
has
not
been
prevented
in
showing
it
in
the
first
instance,
as
in
the
censorship
case.
he
has
shown
the
film
for
several
days.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
except
that
in
these
instances,
and
that
all
we
can
speak
of
is
the
experience.
and,
i
think
that
the
experience
has
indicated
that
the
state
is
ready
to
cooperate
and
conduct
a
hearing,
but
to
follow
out
the
analogy
on
the
censure
case,
in
a
censorship
situation,
a
limited
period
of
delay,
however
short
the
cases
may
differ,
but
a
limited
period
is
permissible.
that
is
all
that
the
state
is
really
seeking
here.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
and,
prior
to
a
judicial
hearing--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
kingsley
books.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
first
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statute--
the
amendment,
i
believe,
became
effective
in
august
of
1972.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
secondly,
it’s
a--
i
have
been
told
that
the
effectiveness
of
the
kingsley
books
statute
is
somewhat
limited
because
it’s
a--
in
a
book
situation.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
had
been
a
very
cumbersome
procedure
to
serve
and
hold
in
advance.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it’s
a
purely
civil
injunction
procedure
which
is
now
contained
in
the
civil
practice
act.
it’s
not
in
civil
practice
law
of
the
rules.
it’s
no
longer
part
of
the
criminal
procedure
statutes
in
new
york,
but
in
a
situation
here,
we
are
only
asking
of
a
seizure
for
a
limited
period,
a
very
limited
period,
until
it
can
be
a
hearing.
we
want
a
speedy
hearing
because
there
is
no
reason
for
these
cases
to
remain
in
the
court
structure
at
all
if
the
def--
if
the
film
is
seized
inadvertently,
and
really
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about.
we’re
really
just
talking
about
the
possible
effect
on
the
first
amendment
if
a
film
is
improperly
seized
in
the
first
instance.
those
films
should
be
returned
to
circulation
forthwith,
but
if
a
film
is
properly
seized,
after
hearing,
a
state
may
hold
it.
i
mean,
even
under
a
quantity
of
books
after
a
full
adversary
hearing
or,
say
in
case
of
this
sort,
after
a
trial,
the
state
may
validly
maintain
custody
of
the
film.
indeed,
an
injunction
could
issue
after
the
trial.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
contraband
or--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
or
a
nuisance
or
one,
whatever
the
appropriate
rupert
might
be
under
the
particular
jurisdiction
but,
the
point
is,
here--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
to
stop,
but
there
is
nothing
to
stop
it
in
any
search
warrant
case.
in
any
case
in
which
a
court
has
multiple
judges
who
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
judge-shopping
for
the
purposes
of
trial.
somehow
or
rather,
a
judge
must
be
selected.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
only
thing
i
understand
new
york
law
would
require
is
that
if
there
were
multiple
applications
for
a
search
warrant,
you
must
indicate
to
the
magistrate
you
apply
to
the
history
of
the
prior
applications.
it
is--
the
magistrate
must
know
that
you’ve
gone
to
someone
before.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
but
the
real
problem
is
getting
a
magistrate
willing
to
hear
it.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
wouldn’t
justify
judge-shopping.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
except
as
a--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
the
questions
is
what’s
before
the
magistrate
on
a
question
of
search
and
seizure
and,
in
new
york,
that
magistrate
has
seen
the
film--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
which
is
the
whole--
all
the
evidence
that
there
really
is,
from
the
prosecution’s
point
of
view,
what
the--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
we’re
not
trying
to
vindicate
a
search
by
what--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
allegedly,
your
honor,
but
what
we
have
in
this
case,
and
i
think
you’ve
realistically
thrown
all
of
these
cases,
we
have
had
a
search
and
seizure
where
a
magistrate
has
seen
the
evidence
and
has
found
eh
film
to
be
obscene.
now,
there’s
some
question
as
to
what
you
found
and
i
just
would
quote
from
the
judge
who
issued
the
warrant,
and
this
appears
in
the
record.
“i
had
seen
the
film
and
it
was
and
is
my
opinion
that
that
film
is
obscene
and
was
obscene
as
i
saw
it
then
under
the
definition
of
obscene,
section
235.00,
the
penal
law.”
now,
the
judge--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
under
the
state
law
of
new
york,
your
honor,
and
i
think
as
we
set
forth
the
state
statute
at
the
outset
of
our
brief,
i
think
the
court
will
see
that
that
is
as
close
a
paraphrase
as
the
legislative
draftsman
was
capable
of
doing
of
the
three-fold
test
this
court
has
announced
in
its
five
decisions
on
obscenity.
if
the
state
statute
is--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
question
is
one
which
can
be
seen
from
the
statute
itself,
that
the
state
has
codified
the
sound
in
this
question--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
why
not
hold
the
hearing,
your
honor?
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
after
a
magistrate
has
seen
the
film,
we
run
a
substantial
risk,
and
has
been
mentioned
several
times
today,
of
alteration
of
a
film,
we
run
the
risk
of
film
disappearing
because
of
will,
and
these
are
not
imaginary.
i
think
there
is
some
concrete
examples
referred
to
in
our
brief
where
it
has
occurred,
and
the
remedies
of
contempt
are
not
practical.
if
the
film
itself
is
gone
and
the
original
version
is
not
available
for
comparison,
the
hearing
process
itself
will
have
to
be
held
sooner
or
later.
the
state--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
because
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
there’d
be
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
who
ascertains
that
there
is
grounds
for
seizure
and
this
court
has
suggested
in
marcus
that
the
first
amendment
does
run
into
that.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
we
might
suggest
that
the
magistrate
must
have,
as
close
to
firsthand,
knowledge
of
the
material
to
be
seized
as
is
possible
in
order
for
him,
in
his
judicial
role,
to
make
that
decision.
that’s
why
the
magistrate
is
required
in
this
seizure
as
in
any
other.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
this
stage,
three
years.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
three
years
and
four
months
to
this
date.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
there
has
been
a
final
adjudication
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
film
was
obscene
and,
given
that
final
adjudication
and
in
48
days
after
the
seizure,
the
state
may
validly
seize
and
hold
that
film.
it
is
not
protected
once--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
would
see
no
reason
why
not.
the--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
single
copy
of
the
book
that
is
seized,
certainly.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
it’s
the
only
book--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
a
final
adjudication
of
obscenity
has
been
made.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
probably
true,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
as
long
as
the
state
has
a--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
why
we’re
here,
your
honor.
that
is--
the
problem
is
that
the
court
has
held
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
obscenity
and,
at
some
stage,
a
decision
must
be
made
in
one
form
or
another
whether
a
matter
is
obscene
or
isn’t.
and,
in
this
situation,
we
have
a
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by,
in
this
case,
a
non-jury
trial,
three-judge
trial,
and
that
is
a
final
judicial
determination
of
the
obscenity
of
this
film.
now,
of
course,
it’s
subject
to
review
on
appeal
and
were
the
film,
returned
or
destroyed,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
court
would
be
unable
to
review
it.
and,
it
is
for
that
reason
the
film
is,
as
i
say,
in
the
custody
of
the
court
clerk’s
office
at
the
current
time,
but
once
that
determination
is
made--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
it’s
the
same
film,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
the
attorney
general
from
kentucky
indicated
he
hadn’t
seen
it
to
see
if
it
is
the
same
film.
and,
i
would
submit
that
if
the
court
choose
to
see
blue
movie--
you’d
see
that
it’d
be
very
difficult
to
ascertain
if
this
was
the
same
film.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
to
return
it
at
any
stage
creates
as--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
many
problems
as
the
retention.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
mit
may
be
a
statute
in
new
york,
your
honor,
that
i’m
unaware
of.
i
just
indicate
that,
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
none
and,
as
a
practical
matter
in
a
case
which
has
been
reported--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
the
film
is
gone,
the
precedential
value
of
the
cases--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not--
the
statutes
are
vague,
at
best,
as
to
the
right
to
retain
or
destroy
evidence
at
the
expiration
of
a
case.
as
a
general
matter,
heroin
is
fungible
and
not
necessarily
valuable
after
a
case
is
disposed
of.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
certainly
is,
and
it’s
generally
destroyed,
but--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
we
certainly
don’t
return
heroin
to
defendants.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
presume
there
is
a
statute
regulating
the
police
property
clerk
which
governs
that
but,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
the
court’s
aware
there’s
a
substantial
problem
in
obscenity
cases
of
the
bar
or
anyone
else
knowing
precisely
what
the
item
that
has
been
adjudicated
is,
and
that
the
objects
are
usually
retained
for
as
long
as
it
is
possible
to
keep
them
in
some
form
of
intact
state
or
another
so
as
to
provide
that
insight
for
further
study,
so
that
in
most
cases
and
certainly
in
most
obscenity
cases
the
material
that’s
been
seized
has
been
held
for
years
and
years.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
believe
the
state
of
new
york
was
in
the
process
of
setting
one
up.
i
don’t
know
if
they
actually
did.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
value
of
a
library
of
obscenity--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
i
think
that’s
the
way
it’s
been
popularly
described,
your
honor.
but,
the
point
we
face
here
is
that
the
state’s
effort
that
new
york
has
adopted
of
acquiring
the
magistrate
to
actually
see
the
material
is
one
which
walks,
we
think,
a
fair
middle
ground
between
the
seizure
by
an
untrained
officer
who
sees
a
film
and
then
seizes
it
and
a
procedure
where
perhaps,
if
the
state
is
lucky,
a
hearing
can
be
held
prior
to
the
time
the
film
is
removed
from
the
jurisdiction.
and,
the
adversary
hearing
approach
in
the
limited
cases
in
which
we
have
tried
it
has
been
very
unsuccessful,
and
i
don’t
blame
the
judges
of
new
york
for
this
purpose.
it
is,
in
fact,
the
nature
of
the
obscenity
business
which
puts
the
incentive
of
delay
and
obstruction
on
the
defendant.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
it
is
the
judges,
but
the
defendant’s
fifth--
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
generally
what
has
been
interjected
and,
i
think,
not
unjustifiably
where
counsel
needs
time
to
prepare.
it
certainly
needs
time
to
prepare.
he
has
to
see
the
film.h
e
has
to
come
get
experts.
experts
have
to
be
contacted.
they
have
to
see
the
film.
a
lengthy
period
of
time
is
required.
we
cannot
have--
if
a
full-pledged
hearing,
as
mr.
anolik
suggested,
be
held,
if
that
is
what
an
adversary
hearing
is
and,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don’t
think
anyone
is
really
to
find
what
it
is
because
the
court
is
just
simply
saying
either
one
is
needed
or
isn’t
and
leave
it
to
the
states
to
work
out
what
they
will.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
but
if
a
hearing
is
required,
then
the
problem
of
delay
is
forced
into
the
hearing
process
by
the
sixth
amendment,
if
nothing
else.
it’s
not
even
bad
faith.
it
may
even
be
good
faith,
but
there
must
be
delay.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
the
def--
if
the
person
who
had
custody
of
the
film
requires
a
time
for
preparation,
then
the
state--
if
he
wants
the
time,
then
should
that
state
return
it
to
him
during
that
period.
i
mean,
that’s
the
practical
effect
of
the
question
because
we
are
ready
for
a
hearing
once
the
film
has
been
seized
as
before
the
court.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
they
may
or
they
may
not,
depending
on
how
it
suits
the
strategy
of
a
particular
defense,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
state
must
be
put
in
a
position
where
delay
is
a
matter
of
right,
and
i
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
make
it
a
matter
of
right.
so
that,
it
is
particularly
appropriate
in
this
instance
where,
in
a
movie
case,
the
state’s
only
proof
is
the
film.
more
than
the
film
would
not
be
required
and
submitted,
and
that
can
be
held
at
the
movie
theater
when
the
man
is
arraigned
promptly,
we
have
courts
operating
from
9
in
the
morning
until
midnight
every
day.
hearings
can
be
held,
but
who
should
have
the
burden
of
initiating
it
after
a
judge
has
seen
the
film
and
has
made
a
determination?
because,
we
submit,
that
it
is
the
judicial
presence
and
not
the
adversary’s
presence
which
is
the
crux
of
what
this
court
has
tried
to
say
in
marcus
and
a
quantity
of
books.
that
is,
there
must
be
a
magistrate
who’s
made
a
specific
determination
on
a
specific
film
and
how
as
to
whether
he
must
hear
argument
or
not,
we
can’t
tell.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
but
the
problem
of
how
much
of
a
contest.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
in
its
opinion
seem
to
treat
it
as
being
a
question
of
argument
as
oppose
to
a
question
of
proof.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
does
bring
the--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
it
is
a
full
contest
at
that
stage
which
is
required.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
the
sug--
the
reading
the
new
york
courts
have
taken
i
think
is
a
reasonable
one
and
that
is
that
the
constitution
in
the
seizure
of
possibly
protected
material
requires
more
than
an
officer’s
statement
as
to
probable
cause,
and
if
a
magistrate,
bringing
the
judicial
mind
to
the
question
of
obscenity,
has
made
a
determination
which,
for
all
intense
and
purposes,
must
be
a
prima
facie
determination,
not
one
of
probably
cause.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
may
be
ex
parte
in
that--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
may
be
ex
parte,
but
that
doesn’t
necessarily
make
it
deficient
because
in
a
judge--
in
deciding
the
questions
of
obscenity,
there
are
no
questions
of
fact
in
the
sense
of
an
informant
type
of
search
warrant
case.
it’s
not
a
factual
determination.
it’s
an
inference
determination,
an
inference
from
basically
a
conceded
fact,
that
is,
the
film
is
conceded
to
be
here.
from
that
film,
what
inference
could
be
drawn?
and,
to
require
the
defendant’s
presence
with
counsel
and,
conceivably,
experts
and
we
really
don’t
know
what
else,
at
this
stage,
would
really
be
an
unreasonable
burden
of
a
valid
state
interest,
a
valid
state
interest
which
this
court
has
upheld
in
saying
that
the
prosecution
of
obscenity
laws
may
be
continued.
so
that,
we
submit
that
the
new
york
practice
under
which
a
magistrate
seize
a
film
prior
to
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
of
allegedly
obscene
material
is
constitutionally
sufficient.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
has,
as
this
court
has
held
many
times,
a
valid
important
interest
in
the
prosecution
of
obscenity
and
the
enforcement
of
the
obscenity
laws
and
that
is
a
state
interest
which
may
be
vindicated
in
any
number
of
ways.
the
state
has
a
number
of
alternatives
opened
to
it,
and
the
court
has
also
held
that
if
there
is
an
important
governmental
interest
which
might
incidentally
limit
protected
speech
that
the
court
must
weigh
the
interest
of
the
state
on
one
hand
and
the
procedures
used
so
that
the
incidental
effects
can
be
minimized
and
that
it
is
this
tight
of
balance
that
must
be
decided
in
any
given
situation.
and,
what
have
we
here?
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
state
has
chosen
to
use
its
penal
statutes,
its
penal
provisions
which
impose
a
penalty
for
the
prior
showing
of
the
film.
that
is,
they
do
not
aim
at
the
future
showing
but
only
at
the
showing
that
occurred
at
some
point
in
the
past
at
some
act
the
defendant
has
already
performed
and,
in
the
course
of
enforcing
this
valid
state
interest
of
imposing
a
penalty
for
the
past
showing,
the
state
of
necessity
must
have
evidence.
and,
in
order
to
obtain
evidence,
there
are
two
choices
at
this
stage.
the
state,
in
a
case
of
a
film,
must
have
testi--
can
have
testimony
of
someone
who
has
seen
the
film
that
testifies
to
its
contents,
or
can
have
the
film.
now,
if
a
person
who
has
seen
the
film
tries
to
testify,
the
problems
of
proof
are,
in
many
cases,
overwhelming.
and
i
believe,
as
the
summary
of
evidence
which
we
have
given
in
our
brief
indicates,
any
testimony
concerning
blue
movie
would
have
been
very
hard
to
discern
by
the
tryer
of
fact.
it
is
a
type
of
movie
which
can
be
seen
in
its
entirety,
as
it--
sorry,
which
must
be
seen
in
its
entirety
as
the
only
way
to
ascertain
what
this
movie
is.
the
description
is
very
difficult
to
do
and,
i
say,
even
counsel,
with
great
deal
of
leisure,
have
had
difficulty
attempting
to
summarize
it
in
any
useful
form.
now,
given
this
problem,
why
should
the
state
be
relegated
to
less
than
the
best
available
probative
evidence
of
a
crime?
why
must
the
state
rely
on
secondary
evidence
which
is
really,
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
worthless?
because,
in
this
case,
i
would
submit
that
a
finder
of
fact
would
have
had
almost
impossible
task
in
figuring
out
what
blue
movie
is
about.
now,
they
say
the
state
has
chosen
the
penal
sanction,
and
i
mention
that
because
that
distinguishes,
in
large
part,
many
of
the
prior
cases
in
this
court
where
states
have
tried
a
civil
injunctive
remedy.
that
is
where
the
state
has
attempted
to
prevent
future
showing.
what
we
are
doing
here
is
enforcing
a
right
against
past
showings.
now,
it
is
true--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
we--
the
film
didn’t
have
to
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
in
order
to
prosecute
it.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
we
did
seize
the
film
and,
in
partial
answer
of
a
question
mr.
justice
marshall
had
asked
before,
the
film
was
currently
in
this
court’s
custody
actually.
it
was
delivered
to
the
court
by
the
district
attorney.
we
still
have
the
film,
but--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
the
subpoena
route
is
not
as
simple,
i
submit,
as
has
been
suggested
by
my
adversary.
the
subpoena
route
has
raised
many
serious
fifth
amendment
problems
where
the
perspective
defendant
is
subpoenaed
to
produce
a
document
in
his
possession
which
is
incriminating.
and,
as
a
practical
matter,
we
have
been
subjected
to
collateral
proceedings
every
time
we
ever
tried
the
subpoena
route.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
and
i
think
the
contemptor’s
power
is
not
a
very
effective
one
for
this
reason.
as
has
been
mentioned
several
times
here,
the
films
are
on
a
schedule
of
circulation
and
if
the
current
distributor--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
has
a
contract
right
which
limits
his
right
to
possession
to
a
very
limited
period
of
time,
he
may
well
have
a
defense
to
any
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
individual
distributer,
generally,
would
have
one
print,
although--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
i
presume
that
each
person
who
had
this
film
had
one
print
in
his
possession.
the
record
doesn’t
tell
us,
but
that
more
than
one
print
exists,
i
think,
is
just
facing
the
facts
of--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
commercial
distribution.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
we
don’t
know
whether
there’s
a
second
print
available
to
this
exhibitor.
we
don’t
know
what
the
terms
of
his
distribution
agreement
were.
he
never
put
any
of
this
in
the
record,
your
honor.
if
the--
if
he
was
going
to
lie
on
that
claim,
then
the
record
is--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
it
certainly
would,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
films
have
shown
in
several
theaters
even
within
the
city
and
we
have
seized
one
print
for
evidence,
but
the
problem
is
this,
and
it’s
a
very
practical
problem.
the
seizure
of
that
first
print
will
effectively
tell
any
defendant
who
is
represented
by
competent
counsel
that
perhaps
he
ought
not
to
show
the
film
in
the
future.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
but
not
because
we
are
preventing
it,
but
because
practicality
of
law
enforcement
is
that
the
penal
sanction,
having
been
invoked
as
to
one
showing,
the
man
runs
a
risk
of
subsequent
prosecution.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
where
they’re
not
subsequent
seizure.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
the
point
is,
your
honor,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
film
is
not
shown
again
even
if
he
had
a
second
print
available
would
not
necessarily
be
because
the
state
would
seize
it,
but
because
the
man
might
be
well-advised
not
to
show
it.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
but,
your
honor,
the
problem
is
this,
and
that’s
why
i
refer
to
this
case
involving
a
film
called
deep
throat
which,
i
believe,
is
referred
to
in
one
of
the
briefs
for
amicus
curiae
in
this
matter,
a
motion
in
brief
which
has
not
yet
been
accepted
by
the
court.
in
that
case,
the
defendant
has
no
incentive
in
conducting
a
hearing.
there
is
no
interest
on
this
defendant’s
part.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
they
have
this
case
come
to
a
hearing.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
our--
we
have
made
every
effort,
your
honor.
this
matter
has
been
on
the
calendar
on
six
occasions
by
my
count
and,
yet,
we
cannot
force
the
case
to
a
hearing,
but
why?
because
the
exhibitor
who
is
commercially
exploiting
the
film
will
not,
in
any
way,
cooperate
with
prosecution,
and
i
think
that
some
of
the
suggestions
made
by
my
adversary
are
perhaps
suggestions
of
fantasy
because
there
is
not
cooperation.
there
is
a
reported
case
in
the
official
reports
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
which
an
adversary
hearing
was
attempted
in
new
york
county.
that
was
our
last
attempt.
that
also
went
on
for
six
weeks.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
we
have
been
held.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
to
my
recollection,
there
had
been
three.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
the
first
one
was
in
1970.
it
went
on
through
the
summer.
we
served
the
defendant
a
notice
of
an
adversary
hearing
to
be
held
the
next
day.
the
upshot
of
that--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
six
weeks
later--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
before
a
magistrate.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
six
weeks
later,
there
were
three
days
of
testimony
given
by
defense
experts.
two
weeks
after
that,
the
judge
handed
down
an
opinion.
six
weeks
after
that,
there
was
a
motion
for
re-argument
on
the
question
of
the
prior
adversary
hearing.
our
experience
in
that
case
led
us
to
litigate
this
case.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
one
terminated
in
an
article
78--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
--
it
would
never
go
to
a
full
hearing.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
film.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
nothing
but
the
film.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
and
then
rested.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct.
in
the
third
case,
i
refer
to
as
deep
throat
which
has
not
yet
come
to
a
hearing,
we
have
tried.
indeed,
it
is
this
problem
that
faces
us
in
the
second
circuit
which
has--
which
prompted
our
office
to,
in
response
to
the
certiorari
petition,
to
suggest
the
court
hear
this
case.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
because
there
is
a
problem
in
new
york--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
our
proposition
is
this.
that
the
state
stands
ready
to
give
the
man
an
adversary
hearing
immediately,
forthwith,
on
the
seizure.
at
the
time
of
the
seizure,
the
man
is
brought
before
a
magistrate.
if
he
wants
a
hearing,
he
can
have
a
hearing
because
the
state’s
whole
case
is
available.
that
is,
the
film
is
before
the
court.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
because
i--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
justice
harlan,
in
his
dissent
in
quantity
of
books
from
market,
11
days
was
a
reasonable
time
for
a
defendant
to
request
to
prepare
a
defense.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
he’s
entitled
to
time
and
the
question
of
how
much
time.
he’s
entitled
to
counsel,
to
declaration--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
if
the
first
amendment
mandates
an
adversary
hearing,
then
i
submit
that
what
we
have
is
the
sixth
amendment
mandating
a
delayed
adversary
hearing--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
kingsley
books.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
now--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that
procedure
was
not
applicable
to
films
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
is
now.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
has
been
amended
to
be
applicable
to
films.
to
my
knowledge,
no
proceeding
under
that
section
has
been--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
and
as
the
cases
of
this
court
have
indicated,
those
hearings
also
go
on
for
months,
that,
although
the
hearings
are
required,
the
defendants
request
time
and,
in
kingsley
books,
they
consented
to
the
injunction
pendently
to
provide
time
to
prepare.
but,
our
experience
with
obscenity,
defendants
has
not
been
that
of--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
of
a
consent
to
delay.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not
in
new
york.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not
in
new
york
currently.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
believe
the
court
has
said
yes,
although
i
believe
the
current
state
of
the
law
has
been
to--
they’ve
been
repealed
in,
i
believe,
every
state
though
i
won’t--
i’m
not
sure.
they
had--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
as
a
result
of
this
courts’
decisions
which
have
cut
down
the
proceeding--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
but
in
freedman
the
court
said
that
a
temporary
removal
of
a
film
from
exhibition
for
a
limited
period,
pending
rapid
state
proceedings,
was
permissible.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
in
a
case
of
this
type,
and
that’s
what
i
see
here,
is
that
this
man
has
shown
the
film
in
the
past.
he
has
not
been
prevented
in
showing
it
in
the
first
instance,
as
in
the
censorship
case.
he
has
shown
the
film
for
several
days.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
except
that
in
these
instances,
and
that
all
we
can
speak
of
is
the
experience.
and,
i
think
that
the
experience
has
indicated
that
the
state
is
ready
to
cooperate
and
conduct
a
hearing,
but
to
follow
out
the
analogy
on
the
censure
case,
in
a
censorship
situation,
a
limited
period
of
delay,
however
short
the
cases
may
differ,
but
a
limited
period
is
permissible.
that
is
all
that
the
state
is
really
seeking
here.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
and,
prior
to
a
judicial
hearing--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
kingsley
books.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
first
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statute--
the
amendment,
i
believe,
became
effective
in
august
of
1972.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
secondly,
it’s
a--
i
have
been
told
that
the
effectiveness
of
the
kingsley
books
statute
is
somewhat
limited
because
it’s
a--
in
a
book
situation.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
had
been
a
very
cumbersome
procedure
to
serve
and
hold
in
advance.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it’s
a
purely
civil
injunction
procedure
which
is
now
contained
in
the
civil
practice
act.
it’s
not
in
civil
practice
law
of
the
rules.
it’s
no
longer
part
of
the
criminal
procedure
statutes
in
new
york,
but
in
a
situation
here,
we
are
only
asking
of
a
seizure
for
a
limited
period,
a
very
limited
period,
until
it
can
be
a
hearing.
we
want
a
speedy
hearing
because
there
is
no
reason
for
these
cases
to
remain
in
the
court
structure
at
all
if
the
def--
if
the
film
is
seized
inadvertently,
and
really
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about.
we’re
really
just
talking
about
the
possible
effect
on
the
first
amendment
if
a
film
is
improperly
seized
in
the
first
instance.
those
films
should
be
returned
to
circulation
forthwith,
but
if
a
film
is
properly
seized,
after
hearing,
a
state
may
hold
it.
i
mean,
even
under
a
quantity
of
books
after
a
full
adversary
hearing
or,
say
in
case
of
this
sort,
after
a
trial,
the
state
may
validly
maintain
custody
of
the
film.
indeed,
an
injunction
could
issue
after
the
trial.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
contraband
or--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
or
a
nuisance
or
one,
whatever
the
appropriate
rupert
might
be
under
the
particular
jurisdiction
but,
the
point
is,
here--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
to
stop,
but
there
is
nothing
to
stop
it
in
any
search
warrant
case.
in
any
case
in
which
a
court
has
multiple
judges
who
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
judge-shopping
for
the
purposes
of
trial.
somehow
or
rather,
a
judge
must
be
selected.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
only
thing
i
understand
new
york
law
would
require
is
that
if
there
were
multiple
applications
for
a
search
warrant,
you
must
indicate
to
the
magistrate
you
apply
to
the
history
of
the
prior
applications.
it
is--
the
magistrate
must
know
that
you’ve
gone
to
someone
before.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
but
the
real
problem
is
getting
a
magistrate
willing
to
hear
it.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
wouldn’t
justify
judge-shopping.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
except
as
a--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
the
questions
is
what’s
before
the
magistrate
on
a
question
of
search
and
seizure
and,
in
new
york,
that
magistrate
has
seen
the
film--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
which
is
the
whole--
all
the
evidence
that
there
really
is,
from
the
prosecution’s
point
of
view,
what
the--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
we’re
not
trying
to
vindicate
a
search
by
what--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
allegedly,
your
honor,
but
what
we
have
in
this
case,
and
i
think
you’ve
realistically
thrown
all
of
these
cases,
we
have
had
a
search
and
seizure
where
a
magistrate
has
seen
the
evidence
and
has
found
eh
film
to
be
obscene.
now,
there’s
some
question
as
to
what
you
found
and
i
just
would
quote
from
the
judge
who
issued
the
warrant,
and
this
appears
in
the
record.
“i
had
seen
the
film
and
it
was
and
is
my
opinion
that
that
film
is
obscene
and
was
obscene
as
i
saw
it
then
under
the
definition
of
obscene,
section
235.00,
the
penal
law.”
now,
the
judge--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
under
the
state
law
of
new
york,
your
honor,
and
i
think
as
we
set
forth
the
state
statute
at
the
outset
of
our
brief,
i
think
the
court
will
see
that
that
is
as
close
a
paraphrase
as
the
legislative
draftsman
was
capable
of
doing
of
the
three-fold
test
this
court
has
announced
in
its
five
decisions
on
obscenity.
if
the
state
statute
is--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
question
is
one
which
can
be
seen
from
the
statute
itself,
that
the
state
has
codified
the
sound
in
this
question--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
why
not
hold
the
hearing,
your
honor?
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
after
a
magistrate
has
seen
the
film,
we
run
a
substantial
risk,
and
has
been
mentioned
several
times
today,
of
alteration
of
a
film,
we
run
the
risk
of
film
disappearing
because
of
will,
and
these
are
not
imaginary.
i
think
there
is
some
concrete
examples
referred
to
in
our
brief
where
it
has
occurred,
and
the
remedies
of
contempt
are
not
practical.
if
the
film
itself
is
gone
and
the
original
version
is
not
available
for
comparison,
the
hearing
process
itself
will
have
to
be
held
sooner
or
later.
the
state--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
because
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
there’d
be
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
who
ascertains
that
there
is
grounds
for
seizure
and
this
court
has
suggested
in
marcus
that
the
first
amendment
does
run
into
that.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
we
might
suggest
that
the
magistrate
must
have,
as
close
to
firsthand,
knowledge
of
the
material
to
be
seized
as
is
possible
in
order
for
him,
in
his
judicial
role,
to
make
that
decision.
that’s
why
the
magistrate
is
required
in
this
seizure
as
in
any
other.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
this
stage,
three
years.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
three
years
and
four
months
to
this
date.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
there
has
been
a
final
adjudication
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
film
was
obscene
and,
given
that
final
adjudication
and
in
48
days
after
the
seizure,
the
state
may
validly
seize
and
hold
that
film.
it
is
not
protected
once--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
would
see
no
reason
why
not.
the--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
single
copy
of
the
book
that
is
seized,
certainly.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
it’s
the
only
book--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
a
final
adjudication
of
obscenity
has
been
made.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
probably
true,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
as
long
as
the
state
has
a--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
why
we’re
here,
your
honor.
that
is--
the
problem
is
that
the
court
has
held
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
obscenity
and,
at
some
stage,
a
decision
must
be
made
in
one
form
or
another
whether
a
matter
is
obscene
or
isn’t.
and,
in
this
situation,
we
have
a
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by,
in
this
case,
a
non-jury
trial,
three-judge
trial,
and
that
is
a
final
judicial
determination
of
the
obscenity
of
this
film.
now,
of
course,
it’s
subject
to
review
on
appeal
and
were
the
film,
returned
or
destroyed,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
court
would
be
unable
to
review
it.
and,
it
is
for
that
reason
the
film
is,
as
i
say,
in
the
custody
of
the
court
clerk’s
office
at
the
current
time,
but
once
that
determination
is
made--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
it’s
the
same
film,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
the
attorney
general
from
kentucky
indicated
he
hadn’t
seen
it
to
see
if
it
is
the
same
film.
and,
i
would
submit
that
if
the
court
choose
to
see
blue
movie--
you’d
see
that
it’d
be
very
difficult
to
ascertain
if
this
was
the
same
film.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
to
return
it
at
any
stage
creates
as--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
many
problems
as
the
retention.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
mit
may
be
a
statute
in
new
york,
your
honor,
that
i’m
unaware
of.
i
just
indicate
that,
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
none
and,
as
a
practical
matter
in
a
case
which
has
been
reported--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
the
film
is
gone,
the
precedential
value
of
the
cases--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
not--
the
statutes
are
vague,
at
best,
as
to
the
right
to
retain
or
destroy
evidence
at
the
expiration
of
a
case.
as
a
general
matter,
heroin
is
fungible
and
not
necessarily
valuable
after
a
case
is
disposed
of.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
certainly
is,
and
it’s
generally
destroyed,
but--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
we
certainly
don’t
return
heroin
to
defendants.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
presume
there
is
a
statute
regulating
the
police
property
clerk
which
governs
that
but,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
the
court’s
aware
there’s
a
substantial
problem
in
obscenity
cases
of
the
bar
or
anyone
else
knowing
precisely
what
the
item
that
has
been
adjudicated
is,
and
that
the
objects
are
usually
retained
for
as
long
as
it
is
possible
to
keep
them
in
some
form
of
intact
state
or
another
so
as
to
provide
that
insight
for
further
study,
so
that
in
most
cases
and
certainly
in
most
obscenity
cases
the
material
that’s
been
seized
has
been
held
for
years
and
years.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
i
believe
the
state
of
new
york
was
in
the
process
of
setting
one
up.
i
don’t
know
if
they
actually
did.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
value
of
a
library
of
obscenity--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
i
think
that’s
the
way
it’s
been
popularly
described,
your
honor.
but,
the
point
we
face
here
is
that
the
state’s
effort
that
new
york
has
adopted
of
acquiring
the
magistrate
to
actually
see
the
material
is
one
which
walks,
we
think,
a
fair
middle
ground
between
the
seizure
by
an
untrained
officer
who
sees
a
film
and
then
seizes
it
and
a
procedure
where
perhaps,
if
the
state
is
lucky,
a
hearing
can
be
held
prior
to
the
time
the
film
is
removed
from
the
jurisdiction.
and,
the
adversary
hearing
approach
in
the
limited
cases
in
which
we
have
tried
it
has
been
very
unsuccessful,
and
i
don’t
blame
the
judges
of
new
york
for
this
purpose.
it
is,
in
fact,
the
nature
of
the
obscenity
business
which
puts
the
incentive
of
delay
and
obstruction
on
the
defendant.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
your
honor,
it
is
the
judges,
but
the
defendant’s
fifth--
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
generally
what
has
been
interjected
and,
i
think,
not
unjustifiably
where
counsel
needs
time
to
prepare.
it
certainly
needs
time
to
prepare.
he
has
to
see
the
film.h
e
has
to
come
get
experts.
experts
have
to
be
contacted.
they
have
to
see
the
film.
a
lengthy
period
of
time
is
required.
we
cannot
have--
if
a
full-pledged
hearing,
as
mr.
anolik
suggested,
be
held,
if
that
is
what
an
adversary
hearing
is
and,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don’t
think
anyone
is
really
to
find
what
it
is
because
the
court
is
just
simply
saying
either
one
is
needed
or
isn’t
and
leave
it
to
the
states
to
work
out
what
they
will.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
but
if
a
hearing
is
required,
then
the
problem
of
delay
is
forced
into
the
hearing
process
by
the
sixth
amendment,
if
nothing
else.
it’s
not
even
bad
faith.
it
may
even
be
good
faith,
but
there
must
be
delay.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
the
def--
if
the
person
who
had
custody
of
the
film
requires
a
time
for
preparation,
then
the
state--
if
he
wants
the
time,
then
should
that
state
return
it
to
him
during
that
period.
i
mean,
that’s
the
practical
effect
of
the
question
because
we
are
ready
for
a
hearing
once
the
film
has
been
seized
as
before
the
court.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
no,
they
may
or
they
may
not,
depending
on
how
it
suits
the
strategy
of
a
particular
defense,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
state
must
be
put
in
a
position
where
delay
is
a
matter
of
right,
and
i
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
make
it
a
matter
of
right.
so
that,
it
is
particularly
appropriate
in
this
instance
where,
in
a
movie
case,
the
state’s
only
proof
is
the
film.
more
than
the
film
would
not
be
required
and
submitted,
and
that
can
be
held
at
the
movie
theater
when
the
man
is
arraigned
promptly,
we
have
courts
operating
from
9
in
the
morning
until
midnight
every
day.
hearings
can
be
held,
but
who
should
have
the
burden
of
initiating
it
after
a
judge
has
seen
the
film
and
has
made
a
determination?
because,
we
submit,
that
it
is
the
judicial
presence
and
not
the
adversary’s
presence
which
is
the
crux
of
what
this
court
has
tried
to
say
in
marcus
and
a
quantity
of
books.
that
is,
there
must
be
a
magistrate
who’s
made
a
specific
determination
on
a
specific
film
and
how
as
to
whether
he
must
hear
argument
or
not,
we
can’t
tell.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
yes,
but
the
problem
of
how
much
of
a
contest.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
in
its
opinion
seem
to
treat
it
as
being
a
question
of
argument
as
oppose
to
a
question
of
proof.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
does
bring
the--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
if
it
is
a
full
contest
at
that
stage
which
is
required.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
that’s
correct.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
well,
your
honor,
the
sug--
the
reading
the
new
york
courts
have
taken
i
think
is
a
reasonable
one
and
that
is
that
the
constitution
in
the
seizure
of
possibly
protected
material
requires
more
than
an
officer’s
statement
as
to
probable
cause,
and
if
a
magistrate,
bringing
the
judicial
mind
to
the
question
of
obscenity,
has
made
a
determination
which,
for
all
intense
and
purposes,
must
be
a
prima
facie
determination,
not
one
of
probably
cause.
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
may
be
ex
parte
in
that--
mr.
lewis
r.
friedman
it
may
be
ex
parte,
but
that
doesn’t
necessarily
make
it
deficient
because
in
a
judge--
in
deciding
the
questions
of
obscenity,
there
are
no
questions
of
fact
in
the
sense
of
an
informant
type
of
search
warrant
case.
it’s
not
a
factual
determination.
it’s
an
inference
determination,
an
inference
from
basically
a
conceded
fact,
that
is,
the
film
is
conceded
to
be
here.
from
that
film,
what
inference
could
be
drawn?
and,
to
require
the
defendant’s
presence
with
counsel
and,
conceivably,
experts
and
we
really
don’t
know
what
else,
at
this
stage,
would
really
be
an
unreasonable
burden
of
a
valid
state
interest,
a
valid
state
interest
which
this
court
has
upheld
in
saying
that
the
prosecution
of
obscenity
laws
may
be
continued.
so
that,
we
submit
that
the
new
york
practice
under
which
a
magistrate
seize
a
film
prior
to
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
of
allegedly
obscene
material
is
constitutionally
sufficient.
