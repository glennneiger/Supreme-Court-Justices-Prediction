quantity
didn’t
hold

that
issue
has
been
on
many
times.
justice

why
is
there
any
more
of
a
chilling
effect
when
in
connection
with
movies?
justice
byron

white
why
do
you
need
to
take
the
film
out
of
circulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
seized
it,
didn’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
was--
wouldn’t
it
have
been
enough
for
your
purposes
to
subpoena
it
for
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
film
would
finish
its
showing
and
they’d
be
out
of
jurisdiction
anyways.
justice

but
if
there
were--
justice
byron

white
let’s
assume
that
there
were
two
copies
readily
available
to
him
and
you
could
have
one
of
them
but
he
could
go
on
showing
the
other.
if
all
you
want
is
evidence,
just
having
one
copy
but
letting
the
other
one
show
would
satisfy
your
need,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
significance
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that’s
a
little
different
situation
than
when
you
effectively
preclude
him
from
showing
the
film.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
i
do
not
recall,
offhand,
the
situation
where
we
have
actually
prosecuted
multiple
counts
for
every
repeated
showing,
but
i
can
bring
to
this
court’s
attention
a
case
which
is
currently
pending
in
the
courts
of
new
york
county
in
which
we
have
started
a
prosecution
and
this
prosecution
was
started
by
the
same
route
as
was
used
here,
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
on
august
17,
1972.
on
august
18,
the
judge
who
awarded
the
seizure
directed
the
film
to
be
returned
to
the
distributor.
that
film
was
at
the
hand
of
the
distributor.
it
has
never
been
produced
in
court
to
this
date.
it
was
on
the
calendar
for
yesterday.
it
was
not
produced
yesterday.
the
distributor
is
showing
it.
since
the
time
of
the
seizure,
i
believe
published
reports
have
shown
that
about
$400,000
in
gross
has
been
taken-in
in
this
picture.
it’s
a
film
showing
in
several
theaters
in
new
york.
the
prospect
of
the
defendant
being
charged
with
multiple
counts
has
maybe
not
dissuaded
him,
although
the
statute
of
limitations
has
not
yet
run
in
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
tell
you
that
until
you
decide
obscenity,
you’re
not
supposed
to
take
steps
to
preclude
circulation
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
have
the
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
wanted
to
get
to
it
and
hold
it,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
film--
isn’t
the
film--
aren’t
films
subject
to
a
different
approach,
in
any
event,
to
licensing?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
advance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
constitutionally
it
could
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
not
under
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
we
never
said
in
freedman
that
there
couldn’t
be
such
a
support.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
why
isn’t
that--
why
doesn’t
that
still
obtain?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
in
censorship
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
if
any--
but
if
you
think
the
other
approach
is
preventing
from
showing
in
advance,
then
there
is
some
pressure
on
him
to
get
on

the
hearing,
