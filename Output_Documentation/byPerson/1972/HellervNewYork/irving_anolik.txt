mr.
irving
anolik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
prior
case.
however,
there
are
marked
differences.
in
this
case,
your
honors,
just
to
orient
the
court
briefly,
on
july
29,
1969,
inspector
smyth
went
to
the
gerak
theater
in
greenwich
village
and
saw
a
movie,
which
is
the
subject
of
the
litigation
before
this
court,
blue
moon
and
apparently
felt
that
it
was
obscene.
he
then
communicated
with
the
prosecutor’s
office
and
on
july
31,
1969,
together
with
just--
the
judge
arthur
goldberg,
no
relation
to
any
judge
in
this
court,
he
returned
to
the
theater
and
judge
goldberg
and
inspector
smyth
saw
the
film
again.
at
that
point,
after
the
film
was
completed
at
july
31,
judge
goldberg
forthwith
signed
a
search
and
seizure
order
without
a
hearing
of
any
sort
whatsoever
and
also
issued
warrants
for
the
arrests
of
mr.
heller,
the
petitioner
here,
and
two
other
employees
of
the
theater.
as
it
turned
out,
of
course,
two
of
the
three
arrests
should
never
have
occurred
because,
before
the
beginning
of
trial
my
concession
with
the
district
attorney,
those
two
arrests
were--
those
two
individuals
were
dismissed
in
the
case
because
they
should
never
have
been
arrested.
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should’ve
been
an
adversary
hearing
is
preserved
in
this
record.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
in
a
first
amendment
situation
that
we
have
here,
the
general
rule
appertaining
to
search
and
seizures
cannot
be
followed,
that
an
adversary
hearing
is
essential
to
protect
vital
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
we
have
the
seizure
of
a
film.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
to
determine
obscenity
del
not.
that’s
correct
because,
first
of
all,
we
do
not
have
a
clear
and
pleasant
danger
here
as
we
might
if
a
person
possessed
munitions
or
narcotics
or
something
of
that
sort.
indeed,
we
know
from
various
cases
and
even
from
the
history
of
this
case
before
the
new
york
courts
that
there
was
sharp
disagreement
as
to
whether
this
film
was
even
obscene
and
we
do
not,
unlike
our
prior--
unlike
the
prior
case,
we
do
not
for
a
moment
concede
that
this
was
obscene.
in
fact,
we
don’t
think
it
was
and,
indeed,
in
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
the
appellate
term
of
the
supreme
court.
the
decision
was
two-to-one
with
justice
markowitz
dissenting
and,
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
chief
judge
and
another
judge
dissented
and
held
that--
or
said
that
the
film
was
not
obscene.
so,
we
have
a
real
sharp
issue
as
to
obscenity,
but
i
want
to
pass
what
i
consider
to
be
an
even
more
paramount
issue.
the
problem
that
we
face
here
is
that
once
this
film
was
seized
and
the
printed--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
the
only
print
and,
indeed,
that--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not
appear
clearly
in
the
record.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
can
only
say
you
asked
a
question
and
it
has
been
told
to
me.
the
district
attorney
has
taken
the
liberty
toward
the
end
of
his
brief
to
go
outside
the
record
to
tell
you
what
his
experience
has
been
with
respect
to
subpoenas,
and
i
ask
this
court
to
accept
it
or
reject
it
however--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
really
don’t
know.[attempt
to
laughter]
however,
let
us
assume,
justice
brennan,
that
arguendo
it
is
the
only
print
because
if--
i
don’t
want
to
go--
mr.
irving
anolik
it
makes
a
difference?
no,
i
don’t
think
it
makes
a
difference
at
all.
mr.
irving
anolik
apparently,
the
only
one
in
existence.
mr.
irving
anolik
the--
apparently,
there
was
no
other
available
to
this
man,
but
we
have
an
overwriting
problem.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
is
not
clear
in
the
record,
no.
it
is
not
clear.
i’m
asking
the
court
to
assume
arguendo,
however,
but
that
was
a--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
know.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
know
that.
however,
we
maintain
that
the
seizure
of
a
film
must
be
equated
with
the
seizure
of
a
mass
quantity
of
books.
mr.
irving
anolik
let
us
assume
there’s
another
film
available,
justice
white,
the
deterrent
effect
of
an
immediate
arrest
for
showing
that
other
film
casts
a
chilling
effect
and
an
impossible
burden.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
realize
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
realize
that,
but
by
the
same
token--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
because
of
the
fact
that
movies
can
be
shown
to
a
large
audience.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
size
of
the
audience
that
must
be
the
criterion
and
not
the
item.
the
district
attorney,
indeed,
in
his
brief
says,
on
page
35,
that
this
court
should
consider
the
seizure
of
a
film
and
equate
it
to
a
seizure
of
one
book,
and
we
do
not
subscribe
to
that
and,
indeed,
the
united--
mr.
irving
anolik
unfortunately,
that
was
never
actually
developed
in
the
record.
i
have
not
tried
the
case.
it
was
not
actually
developed
in
the
record,
justice
brennan.
but,
to
say
that
another
print
of
the
film
is
available,
i
think,
actually
begs
the
issue
here
because
it
is
the
adversary
proceeding
that
we
are
addressing
ourselves
to
at
this
time,
and
we
think
that
is
a
very
important
issue
and
we
are
leading
aside
to
the
time
being
whether
or
not
it’s
even
obscene.
mr.
irving
anolik
perhaps
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
would
say
that
it’s
quite
unusual
for
a
film
to
be
produced
where
there’s
only
one
print.
that’s
quite
unusual.
mr.
irving
anolik
this
is
a
low-budget--
mr.
irving
anolik
as
far
as
i
know,
it
was
shown
in
only
one
theater
in
new
york.
this
was
not
syndicated
through
a
number
of
theaters.
it
was
only
at
the
gerak
theater
that
this
was
being
shown.
apparently,
it
was
a
low-budget
picture.
the
quality
of
the
film
is
not
even
good.
i
think
that’s
conceded
in
the
record.
it
was--
mr.
irving
anolik
it’s
a
war
hole
film,
but
it’s
not
like
some
of
those
others
which
are
being
syndicated
around
town
such
as
heat
and
things
of
that
sort.
this
is
a
different
type
and
this
was
apparently
issued
through
a
corporation
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
owners
of
the
stock.
mr.
irving
anolik
there
probably
would
not
be,
but
let
us--
mr.
irving
anolik
there
may
have
been
copies
in
the
west
coast.
that’s
a
possibility
but,
nonetheless,
the
seizure
here
amounted
to
what
we
consider
to
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
problem
that
arises,
of
course,
is
that
the
film
itself
is
seized
and
it’s
true
that
the
district
attorney
argues
that,
well,
a
motion
to
suppress
can
be
promptly
made.
but,
he
casts
the
burden
upon
the
defendant
to
make
such
a
motion
and
says
that
were
the
burden
otherwise,
in
other
words,
if
an
adversary
hearing
had
to
be
held
before
you
could
seize
a
film,
then
a
defendant
could
delay
such
an
adversary
hearing
and
delay
justice,
but
you
can
turn
that
right
around.
the
district
attorney
asks
this
court
to
assume
that
the
district
attorney
or
other
prosecutor
would
never
delay
such
a
proceeding.
that
is
not
at
all
evident.
we’re
not
dealing
with
new
york
county
alone.
we’re
dealing
with
an
overwriting
consideration
here.
there
could
be
delay
on
the
part
of
a
prosecutor
but,
more
important
than
that,
when
we
deal
with
a
first
amendment
situation
such
as
this
where
we
have
a
theater
with
299
seats,
and
this
incidentally
is
a
closed
theater.
this
is
not
a
theater
such
as
in
a
rave
or
in
the
roaden
case
where
maybe
you
can
see
something
from
the
road.
mr.
heller
who
testified,
who
happens
to
be
an
attorney
incidentally,
testified
that
the--
there
was
a
sign
in
the
lobby
of
the
theater
that
the
film
was
marked
x,
that
no
one
under
17
would
be
admitted
and,
indeed,
he
said
they,
including
him,
enforced
a
rule
that
no
one
apparently
under
18
was
admitted.
there
was
no
complaint
received
by
any
member
of
the
public.
this
was
a
situation
where
the
police,
apparently
protecting
some
unknown
and
anonymous
person,
were
arrogating
to
themselves
the
right
of
censorship
over
films,
decided
to
look
at
the
films
and
“well,
we’re
going
to
seize
this
film.”
that’s
about
the
size
of
it,
and
we
maintain
that
the
problem
of
not
holding
the
adversary
hearing,
in
essence,
means
that
the
prosecutor
can
arrogate
to
himself
the
right
to
seize
the
film
and
to
put
the
theater
out
of
business
because
most
theaters
book
films,
let’s
say,
for
three,
four
days
a
week
or
so.
it’s
not
that
easy
once
the
film
is
seized
suddenly,
as
was--
as
happened
here,
to
suddenly
get
another
replacement
film.
it’s
quite
difficult
in
fact.
the
arrest
of
the
personnel
is
quite
a
traumatic
effect,
as
indeed
two
of
the
three
arrests
here
should
not
even
have
occurred.
and,
the
net
result
is
that
not
only
do
you
have
an
economic
loss
to
the
owner
of
the
film,
but
you
have
a
tremendous
economic
loss
to
the
movie
house,
the
exhibit.
now,
let
us
consider
the
situation
where
a
prosecutor,
perhaps
not
as
liberal
as
some,
decides
that
a
particular
movie
is
offensive.
that
prosecutor,
if
he
follows
the
procedure
here,
can
handpick
a
judge
and,
incidentally,
there’s
no--
nothing
in
the
record
here
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
how
judge
goldberg
was
chosen
to
come
down
to
court.
so,
we
could--
we
have
a
right
at
least
to
speculate
that
maybe
this
judge
was
handpicked,
brought
down,
and
he
issues
this
forthwith
warrant.
now,
if
judge
markowitz,
for
example,
who
dissented
in
the
appellant
term,
had
been
used
as
the
magistrate,
there
would
not
have
been
a
seizure,
there
would
not
have
been
an
arrest
and,
indeed,
this
case
may
not--
might
not
have
even
been
up
here.
so,
w
have
that
dangerous
situation
in
a
first
amendment
case
whereby
the
district
attorney
can
decide,
perhaps
subject
to
a
certain
ethics
of
course,
and
we
don’t
maintain
that
all
prosecutors
necessarily
have
the
ethics
of
the
new
york
county
district
attorney’s
office,
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
magistrate
came
down
there
and
forthwith
issued
this
search
and
seizure
order
and
arrest
order.
mr.
irving
anolik
now,
i
understand
that
since
this
situation
has
occurred
and
in
view
of
death
view
amusement
park,
in
the
second
circuit--
an
astro
film
is
in
the
second
circuit
and,
indeed,
decisions
in
sixth
circuit
courts
of
appeal--
i
believe
the
procedure
in
new
york
county
is
that
they
do
give
out
that
sort
of
hearings
now.
apparently,
it
recognizes
the
serious
question
as
to
whether
they
should
or
should
not.
this
is
the
case
which
apparently
will
crystallize
whether
or
not
they
should
continue
doing
it,
but
i’m
sure
mr.
friedman
will
be
able
to
speak
more
authority
as
what
the
actual
procedure
is.
but,
be
that
as
it
may,
in
the
brief
of
the
district
attorney,
he
says
that
judge
goldberg
and
inspector
smyth
did
not
see
or
do
not
recall
seeing
signs
that
this
was
restricted
to
people
over
17
years
of
age
and
that
the
film
was
marked
x.
mr.
heller
testified
under
oath
that
that
was
in
fact
the
case,
and
there’s
nothing
to
contradict
that
in
the
record.
merely,
the
fact
they
didn’t
recall
seeing
it
certainly
is
not
contradiction.
the--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
that’s
in
the
record.
mr.
irving
anolik
judge
goldberg
testified
and
so
did
inspector
smyth
testify.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
rehnquist,
there
was
an
attempt
to
cross-examine
judge
goldberg
as
to
what
criteria
he
used
to
determine
what--
why
this
was
obscene
and,
indeed,
perhaps
to
determine
if
he
was
even
familiar
with
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court
in
roth
and
in
other
cases
because
i
don’t
think
we
have
a
right
to
assume
that
lower
court
judges
necessarily
are
always
conversant
with
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court.
in
an
adversary
hearing,
at
least
these
matters
could
be
called
to
the
attention
of
these
jurors
to
determine
“are
you,
in
fact,
judging
this
seizure
by
the
standards
set
down
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
or
is
it
some
visceral
reaction
that
you
are
motivated
by?”
mr.
irving
anolik
at
least
to
cross-examine
the
complainant
be
he
a
magistrate
or
for
inspector
smyth.
mr.
irving
anolik
he
was
the
magistrate
who
issued
the
search
warrant,
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
i
would
say
that
if
the
party
at
least
who
was
in
the
role
of
the
complainant.
the
problem
with
this
case,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
judge
goldberg
became
a
prosecution
witness,
so
to
speak,
in
this
case
saying
that
he
determined
that
the
film
was
obscene
and,
to
that
extent,
having
become
a
witness
at
the
trial,
counsel
at
least
tried
to
determine
what
standards
he
had
applied
and
they
did
not
permit
cross-examination
as
to
that
question.
i
am
not
saying--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
am
not
saying
that
necessarily,
in
all
cases,
i
would
say
that
where
a
detached
impartial
magistrate
issues
a
search
warrant
that
you
have
a
right
to
cross-examine
him
as
to
why
he
did
it.
if
i
interpret
it
saying
that,
i
didn’t
mean
to
imply
that,
justice
rehnquist.
i
am
saying
that
at
least
the
complainant,
in
this
case,
inspector
smyth.
at
least
to
that
extent,
cross-examination
should
be
permitted
and
an
opportunity
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
magistrate
the
precedence
and
the
holdings
of
this
court
and,
perhaps,
the
courts
of
new
york
as
to
what
the
definition
of
community
standards
are,
what
the
definition
of
obscenity
is
under
the
roth
testing
of
the
test.
that,
at
least,
should
have
been
permitted
and
ought
to
be
permitted
in
any
first
amendment
situation
case.
that
is
our
position,
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
thought
it
was
reproduced.
mr.
irving
anolik
your
friend
from
the
state
seems
to
indicate
that
he
doesn’t
think
it’s
in
there.
mr.
irving
anolik
it--
if
it
were
to
follow
the
usual
search
warrant
situation,
it
would
say
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
search
warrant
should
issue,
and
he
applied
a
fourth
amendment
standard
to
a
search
and
seizure
situation.
that
is
what
would
obtain
here,
and
that
is
the
situation
which,
no
doubt,
motivated
justice
goldberg.
we
maintain
that
a
fourth
amendment
standard
may
not
be
applied
in
first
amendment
situations
such
as
this.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes?
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
would
certainly
be
a
full-scale
hearing.
they
presumably
have
to--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes?
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
not.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
this
is
the
state
of
new
york,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
county
of
new
york.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
would
say
that
they
would
have
to
prove
it
by
the
standard
appertainable
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
right,
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
don’t
think
preponderance--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
the
object
of
seizing
the
film
here
is
to,
in
effect,
take
the
film
away,
out
of
the
possession
of
the
individual
and,
while
it’s
true
that
is
evidence,
we
maintain
they
must
proceed
by
subpoena
and,
of
course,
with
the
subpoena
you
can
make
a
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena.
but,
in
a
first
amendment
situation,
we
would
ask
that
nothing
less
than
a
full
adversary
hearing--
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
if
it’s
an
injunction,
then
i
would
say
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
credible
evidence
might
be
sufficient.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
that
the
standard
that
you
would
use--
mr.
irving
anolik
in
effect,
i
would
say--
although
it
seems
to
be
rather
logical
to
say
that,
i
would
say,
in
effect,
that
would
have
to
be
our
position.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
would
say
that
perhaps
we
could
use
a
different
standard
because,
as
i
understand
it,
a
standard
as
to,
for
example,
a
fair
preponderance
might
be
sufficient
to
see
that
at
least
some
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
has
not
occurred.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
be
prepared,
as
i
say,
to
at
least
reanalyze
the
standard
of
proof,
in
view
of
the
way
you
set
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
be
willing
to
do
or
at
least
concede--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
it
is
my
position,
as
i
say,
that
nothing
less
than
a
full
adversary
hearing
where
a
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
obtained
should
be
had.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
would
say
that
would,
of
course,
would
seem
to
be
a
situation
where
you’d
have
a
jury
trial
perhaps
on
a
different
scale,
because
there
you’d
be
trying--
mr.
irving
anolik
an
individual.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
but
the
point
is,
in
the
one
case,
you’re
judging
the
film
itself.
in
the
other
case,
you’re
judging
whether
he
promoted
in--
obscenity.
it’s
a
little
bit
different
standard
there
because
it’s
section
235,
the
obscenity
section
235.05
that
we
have
promoting
obscenity.
so,
it’s
a
little
bit
different
standard
that
we’re
dealing
with.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes?
mr.
irving
anolik
the
first
hearing
would
determine
what
the
film
itself--
mr.
irving
anolik
what
happens?
n
the
first
hearing,
there
would
be
a
determination
of
whether--
as
to
whether
the
film
itself
is
obscene
under
appropriate
community
standards.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
he
showed
the
film?
no,
doubt
about
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
he--
i
think
that
we
have--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
think
you’d
have
to
show
that
he
had
knowledge
and
intent.
mr.
irving
anolik
to
show
an
obscene
film.
in
other
words,
we
maintain
that
there
is,
at
the
basis
of
a
criminal
statute,
at
least
that
degree
of
due
process
which
would
require
the
state
to
establish
that
this
man
knowingly
and
willfully--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
the--
i
think
you’d
have
to
show
some
intent.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
that
for
example,
this
man,
in
good
faith,
believes
this
was
not
an
obscene
film
because
it’s--
mr.
irving
anolik
he
has
testified,
that’s
right,
but
he
was
not
the
subject
of
the
other
hearing.
the
subject
of
the
other
hearing
was
the
film
itself.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
we
maintain
that
it
was
the
film
itself
which
is
the
criterion
of
the
other
hearing.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
difference
being
that,
in
the
one
case--
mr.
irving
anolik
the
practical
is
that,
in
the
one
case,
we’re
testing
out
whether
or
not
the
film
itself
should’ve
been
seized,
whether
or
not
it’s
in
fact
obscene.
let
us
assume
the
court
then
decides
that
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
defendant,
that
they
hold
that
the
film
was
obscene.
the
issue
then
is
did
he
promote--
if
he
pleads
not
guilty,
now,
it
may
be
that
he
was
found
in
the
projection
room.
it
may
be
that
he
was
found
taking
money,
but
that
would
not
automatically
presume
him
guilty.
having
plead
not
guilty,
he’d
be
entitled
to
a
trial
as
to
his
own--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
wouldn’t
think
so,
because
in
narcotics
cases
there,
again,
has
to
be
some
element
of
criminal
intent
and
knowledge
because,
frequently,
a
person
who’s
found
in
possession
of
heroin
and
there’s
a
chemical
analysis.
there’s
absolutely
no
doubt
that
the
matter
is
heroin
and
that
he
was
found
with
it
and
was
sold
to
an
agent.
that
does
not
mean
he’s
not
entitled
to
a
trial
in
the
merits.
mr.
irving
anolik
as
a
practical
effect,
i’ll
say
this.
that
i
have
seen
cases,
justice
marshall,
where
there
had
been
disagreements
or
acquittals
of
defendants
notwithstanding
the
fact
that,
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
they
lost
the
case
they
were
called.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
there
aren’t
too
many
of
those.
i’d
have
to
agree.
there
aren’t
too
many
of
those
because
you
are
taking
the
narcotics
here,
but
why
don’t
we
take
some
other
situation
where
we’re
not
dealing
with
anything
as
dramatic
as
narcotics,
where
we’re
dealing
with
something,
perhaps
the
possession
of
an
unloaded
gun
or
the
possession,
for
example,
of
the
material--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
your
honor,
as
i
said,
i--
if
you
noted,
i
was
willing
to
backtrack
a
little
bit
on
that
aspect.
i
would
say
that
i
perhaps
should
adopt
the
standard
of
a
fair
preponderance
for
that
purpose,
and
insist
upon
beyond
reasonable
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
trial.
as
i
say,
upon
analysis,
justice
marshall,
and
if
you
would
give
me
an
opportunity
perhaps
to
amend
my
rather
adamant
position
previously,
that
perhaps
upon
reflection
a
preponderance
test
should
be
used
in
the
initial
hearing
and
reasonable
doubt
in
the
trial
proper.
that
would
be
perhaps
a
more
reasonable
situation.
what--
an
adversary
hearing,
however,
of
some
sort
must,
of
necessity,
be
held,
we
maintain,
to
protect
a
first
amendment
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
justice
stewart?
mr.
irving
anolik
the
movie
would
have
to
be
there,
but
the
point
is
this.
it
should
not
be
in--
with
the
possession
of
the
district
attorney
because
assuming--
let’s
say
that
we
won
the
suppression
hearing.
they
said
it
should
not
have
been
seized.
under
new
york
law,
the
district
attorney
could
appeal
that
and
retains
possession
of
the
property
until
it
goes
through
the
appellate
process.
he
is
not
required
to
return
that
film
because
that’s
true
in
all
search
and
seizure
cases.
the
district
attorney
can
appeal
forthwith
if
he
says
he
cannot
proceed
with
the
case
and,
therefore,
he
retains
possession
of
that
until
it
goes
through
the
full
appellate
process.
we
do
not
have
a
concomitant
right
of
appeal
if
the
suppression
is
not
granted
because
we
would
have
to
either,
plead
guilty
and
then
appeal,
or
else
we
have
to
go
through
a
full
trial
and
then
appeal
for
the
judgment
of
conviction
before
we
could
appeal
that
question.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
would
work
by--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
a
subpoena
and
we
maintain
the
subpoena
is
perfectly
alright
because
there’s
a
contempt
power
behind
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct,
for
the
film.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
just--
mr.
irving
anolik
but
just
for
one
day,
not
for
weeks
or
months
or
years,
just
for
one
day,
just
for
the
purpose
of
showing
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
and
then
it’s
immediately
returned.
mr.
irving
anolik
i’d
say
that
they
would
have
to
schedule
a
showing.
on
the
subpoena,
you
are
to
bring
the
subpoena
on
the--
at
10
a.m.
on
monday,
whenever
it
might
be,
for
the
purpose
of
showing
it
to
the
court.
they
bring
it
there
at
that
time,
they
show
it
to
the
court,
and
they
take
it
right
back
to
the
theater.
mr.
irving
anolik
but,
that’s
true--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that’s
true
of
any
situation
where
you
have
subpoenaed
records.
as
i
understand,
a
subpoena
does
not
entitle--
mr.
irving
anolik
well--
but,
it’s
not
that
easy.
it
has
to
be
taken
to
particular
labs.
exhibitors
don’t
have
the
facilities
to
do
that
and,
also,
why
should
we
imply
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
any
citizen
without
proof
of
that?
i
mean,
why
is
it
that
the
district
attorney
can
do
no
wrong?
the
district
attorney
might
doctor
that
film,
for
all
we
know,
if
he
has
it
in
his
position.
why
should
we
assume
that
he
wouldn’t
do
that?i
mean,
if
this
is
custodia
legis
in
the
hands
of
an
individual,
it’s
his
property.
why
should
he
be
deprived
of
it
and
why
should
we--
mr.
irving
anolik
absolutely.
mr.
irving
anolik
not
only
contempt,
perhaps
forgery
prosecution
of
offering
a
forged
document.
i
mean,
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
inhibitions
that
can
be
done.
now,
sixth
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
held
that
adversary
hearing
should
be
held.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
what
happens
is
then,
it’s
true.
he’s
going
to
be
the
problem
of
his
film.
he’s
going
to
be
the
problem
of
his
film--
mr.
irving
anolik
pardon
me?
mr.
irving
anolik
i’m
sorry.
did
you
say
before
the
criminal
conviction?
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
hearing--
mr.
irving
anolik
and
if
it’s
only
the
adversary
hearing,
they
would
have
to
wait
for
a
conviction
on
the
merits,
we
would
maintain.
mr.
irving
anolik
before
that
was
done.
mr.
irving
anolik
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
say,
to
take
a
constant
position,
that
until
there’s
a
finding
of
guilt
by
a
court
that
the
film,
it
being
a
first
amendment
property
right
we’re
dealing
with--
mr.
irving
anolik
should
not
be
seized
at
all.
mr.
irving
anolik
we
don’t
think
that
present
situation
requires
that
to
be
seized.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
would
be
an
adversary
hearing
and
we--
mr.
irving
anolik
we
would
use
a
standard
of
a
fair
preponderance.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
as
promptly
as
possible.
mr.
irving
anolik
again,
through
subpoena,
it
is
displayed
to
the
court,
and
until
there’s
a
finding
of
guilty,
it
should
not
be
seized.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
eventually,
if
it’s
deemed
to
be
obscene
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
i
presume
they
could
seize
it
because
it
would
technically
be
contraband
at
that
point.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes?
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
so.
i
think
for--
like
a
video
tape
or
something
of
the
films?
mr.
irving
anolik
that
might
be--
that
would
probably
satisfy
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
irving
anolik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
prior
case.
however,
there
are
marked
differences.
in
this
case,
your
honors,
just
to
orient
the
court
briefly,
on
july
29,
1969,
inspector
smyth
went
to
the
gerak
theater
in
greenwich
village
and
saw
a
movie,
which
is
the
subject
of
the
litigation
before
this
court,
blue
moon
and
apparently
felt
that
it
was
obscene.
he
then
communicated
with
the
prosecutor’s
office
and
on
july
31,
1969,
together
with
just--
the
judge
arthur
goldberg,
no
relation
to
any
judge
in
this
court,
he
returned
to
the
theater
and
judge
goldberg
and
inspector
smyth
saw
the
film
again.
at
that
point,
after
the
film
was
completed
at
july
31,
judge
goldberg
forthwith
signed
a
search
and
seizure
order
without
a
hearing
of
any
sort
whatsoever
and
also
issued
warrants
for
the
arrests
of
mr.
heller,
the
petitioner
here,
and
two
other
employees
of
the
theater.
as
it
turned
out,
of
course,
two
of
the
three
arrests
should
never
have
occurred
because,
before
the
beginning
of
trial
my
concession
with
the
district
attorney,
those
two
arrests
were--
those
two
individuals
were
dismissed
in
the
case
because
they
should
never
have
been
arrested.
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should’ve
been
an
adversary
hearing
is
preserved
in
this
record.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
in
a
first
amendment
situation
that
we
have
here,
the
general
rule
appertaining
to
search
and
seizures
cannot
be
followed,
that
an
adversary
hearing
is
essential
to
protect
vital
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
we
have
the
seizure
of
a
film.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
to
determine
obscenity
del
not.
that’s
correct
because,
first
of
all,
we
do
not
have
a
clear
and
pleasant
danger
here
as
we
might
if
a
person
possessed
munitions
or
narcotics
or
something
of
that
sort.
indeed,
we
know
from
various
cases
and
even
from
the
history
of
this
case
before
the
new
york
courts
that
there
was
sharp
disagreement
as
to
whether
this
film
was
even
obscene
and
we
do
not,
unlike
our
prior--
unlike
the
prior
case,
we
do
not
for
a
moment
concede
that
this
was
obscene.
in
fact,
we
don’t
think
it
was
and,
indeed,
in
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
the
appellate
term
of
the
supreme
court.
the
decision
was
two-to-one
with
justice
markowitz
dissenting
and,
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
chief
judge
and
another
judge
dissented
and
held
that--
or
said
that
the
film
was
not
obscene.
so,
we
have
a
real
sharp
issue
as
to
obscenity,
but
i
want
to
pass
what
i
consider
to
be
an
even
more
paramount
issue.
the
problem
that
we
face
here
is
that
once
this
film
was
seized
and
the
printed--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
the
only
print
and,
indeed,
that--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not
appear
clearly
in
the
record.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
can
only
say
you
asked
a
question
and
it
has
been
told
to
me.
the
district
attorney
has
taken
the
liberty
toward
the
end
of
his
brief
to
go
outside
the
record
to
tell
you
what
his
experience
has
been
with
respect
to
subpoenas,
and
i
ask
this
court
to
accept
it
or
reject
it
however--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
really
don’t
know.[attempt
to
laughter]
however,
let
us
assume,
justice
brennan,
that
arguendo
it
is
the
only
print
because
if--
i
don’t
want
to
go--
mr.
irving
anolik
it
makes
a
difference?
no,
i
don’t
think
it
makes
a
difference
at
all.
mr.
irving
anolik
apparently,
the
only
one
in
existence.
mr.
irving
anolik
the--
apparently,
there
was
no
other
available
to
this
man,
but
we
have
an
overwriting
problem.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
is
not
clear
in
the
record,
no.
it
is
not
clear.
i’m
asking
the
court
to
assume
arguendo,
however,
but
that
was
a--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
know.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
know
that.
however,
we
maintain
that
the
seizure
of
a
film
must
be
equated
with
the
seizure
of
a
mass
quantity
of
books.
mr.
irving
anolik
let
us
assume
there’s
another
film
available,
justice
white,
the
deterrent
effect
of
an
immediate
arrest
for
showing
that
other
film
casts
a
chilling
effect
and
an
impossible
burden.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
realize
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
realize
that,
but
by
the
same
token--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
because
of
the
fact
that
movies
can
be
shown
to
a
large
audience.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
size
of
the
audience
that
must
be
the
criterion
and
not
the
item.
the
district
attorney,
indeed,
in
his
brief
says,
on
page
35,
that
this
court
should
consider
the
seizure
of
a
film
and
equate
it
to
a
seizure
of
one
book,
and
we
do
not
subscribe
to
that
and,
indeed,
the
united--
mr.
irving
anolik
unfortunately,
that
was
never
actually
developed
in
the
record.
i
have
not
tried
the
case.
it
was
not
actually
developed
in
the
record,
justice
brennan.
but,
to
say
that
another
print
of
the
film
is
available,
i
think,
actually
begs
the
issue
here
because
it
is
the
adversary
proceeding
that
we
are
addressing
ourselves
to
at
this
time,
and
we
think
that
is
a
very
important
issue
and
we
are
leading
aside
to
the
time
being
whether
or
not
it’s
even
obscene.
mr.
irving
anolik
perhaps
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
would
say
that
it’s
quite
unusual
for
a
film
to
be
produced
where
there’s
only
one
print.
that’s
quite
unusual.
mr.
irving
anolik
this
is
a
low-budget--
mr.
irving
anolik
as
far
as
i
know,
it
was
shown
in
only
one
theater
in
new
york.
this
was
not
syndicated
through
a
number
of
theaters.
it
was
only
at
the
gerak
theater
that
this
was
being
shown.
apparently,
it
was
a
low-budget
picture.
the
quality
of
the
film
is
not
even
good.
i
think
that’s
conceded
in
the
record.
it
was--
mr.
irving
anolik
it’s
a
war
hole
film,
but
it’s
not
like
some
of
those
others
which
are
being
syndicated
around
town
such
as
heat
and
things
of
that
sort.
this
is
a
different
type
and
this
was
apparently
issued
through
a
corporation
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
owners
of
the
stock.
mr.
irving
anolik
there
probably
would
not
be,
but
let
us--
mr.
irving
anolik
there
may
have
been
copies
in
the
west
coast.
that’s
a
possibility
but,
nonetheless,
the
seizure
here
amounted
to
what
we
consider
to
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
problem
that
arises,
of
course,
is
that
the
film
itself
is
seized
and
it’s
true
that
the
district
attorney
argues
that,
well,
a
motion
to
suppress
can
be
promptly
made.
but,
he
casts
the
burden
upon
the
defendant
to
make
such
a
motion
and
says
that
were
the
burden
otherwise,
in
other
words,
if
an
adversary
hearing
had
to
be
held
before
you
could
seize
a
film,
then
a
defendant
could
delay
such
an
adversary
hearing
and
delay
justice,
but
you
can
turn
that
right
around.
the
district
attorney
asks
this
court
to
assume
that
the
district
attorney
or
other
prosecutor
would
never
delay
such
a
proceeding.
that
is
not
at
all
evident.
we’re
not
dealing
with
new
york
county
alone.
we’re
dealing
with
an
overwriting
consideration
here.
there
could
be
delay
on
the
part
of
a
prosecutor
but,
more
important
than
that,
when
we
deal
with
a
first
amendment
situation
such
as
this
where
we
have
a
theater
with
299
seats,
and
this
incidentally
is
a
closed
theater.
this
is
not
a
theater
such
as
in
a
rave
or
in
the
roaden
case
where
maybe
you
can
see
something
from
the
road.
mr.
heller
who
testified,
who
happens
to
be
an
attorney
incidentally,
testified
that
the--
there
was
a
sign
in
the
lobby
of
the
theater
that
the
film
was
marked
x,
that
no
one
under
17
would
be
admitted
and,
indeed,
he
said
they,
including
him,
enforced
a
rule
that
no
one
apparently
under
18
was
admitted.
there
was
no
complaint
received
by
any
member
of
the
public.
this
was
a
situation
where
the
police,
apparently
protecting
some
unknown
and
anonymous
person,
were
arrogating
to
themselves
the
right
of
censorship
over
films,
decided
to
look
at
the
films
and
“well,
we’re
going
to
seize
this
film.”
that’s
about
the
size
of
it,
and
we
maintain
that
the
problem
of
not
holding
the
adversary
hearing,
in
essence,
means
that
the
prosecutor
can
arrogate
to
himself
the
right
to
seize
the
film
and
to
put
the
theater
out
of
business
because
most
theaters
book
films,
let’s
say,
for
three,
four
days
a
week
or
so.
it’s
not
that
easy
once
the
film
is
seized
suddenly,
as
was--
as
happened
here,
to
suddenly
get
another
replacement
film.
it’s
quite
difficult
in
fact.
the
arrest
of
the
personnel
is
quite
a
traumatic
effect,
as
indeed
two
of
the
three
arrests
here
should
not
even
have
occurred.
and,
the
net
result
is
that
not
only
do
you
have
an
economic
loss
to
the
owner
of
the
film,
but
you
have
a
tremendous
economic
loss
to
the
movie
house,
the
exhibit.
now,
let
us
consider
the
situation
where
a
prosecutor,
perhaps
not
as
liberal
as
some,
decides
that
a
particular
movie
is
offensive.
that
prosecutor,
if
he
follows
the
procedure
here,
can
handpick
a
judge
and,
incidentally,
there’s
no--
nothing
in
the
record
here
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
how
judge
goldberg
was
chosen
to
come
down
to
court.
so,
we
could--
we
have
a
right
at
least
to
speculate
that
maybe
this
judge
was
handpicked,
brought
down,
and
he
issues
this
forthwith
warrant.
now,
if
judge
markowitz,
for
example,
who
dissented
in
the
appellant
term,
had
been
used
as
the
magistrate,
there
would
not
have
been
a
seizure,
there
would
not
have
been
an
arrest
and,
indeed,
this
case
may
not--
might
not
have
even
been
up
here.
so,
w
have
that
dangerous
situation
in
a
first
amendment
case
whereby
the
district
attorney
can
decide,
perhaps
subject
to
a
certain
ethics
of
course,
and
we
don’t
maintain
that
all
prosecutors
necessarily
have
the
ethics
of
the
new
york
county
district
attorney’s
office,
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
magistrate
came
down
there
and
forthwith
issued
this
search
and
seizure
order
and
arrest
order.
mr.
irving
anolik
now,
i
understand
that
since
this
situation
has
occurred
and
in
view
of
death
view
amusement
park,
in
the
second
circuit--
an
astro
film
is
in
the
second
circuit
and,
indeed,
decisions
in
sixth
circuit
courts
of
appeal--
i
believe
the
procedure
in
new
york
county
is
that
they
do
give
out
that
sort
of
hearings
now.
apparently,
it
recognizes
the
serious
question
as
to
whether
they
should
or
should
not.
this
is
the
case
which
apparently
will
crystallize
whether
or
not
they
should
continue
doing
it,
but
i’m
sure
mr.
friedman
will
be
able
to
speak
more
authority
as
what
the
actual
procedure
is.
but,
be
that
as
it
may,
in
the
brief
of
the
district
attorney,
he
says
that
judge
goldberg
and
inspector
smyth
did
not
see
or
do
not
recall
seeing
signs
that
this
was
restricted
to
people
over
17
years
of
age
and
that
the
film
was
marked
x.
mr.
heller
testified
under
oath
that
that
was
in
fact
the
case,
and
there’s
nothing
to
contradict
that
in
the
record.
merely,
the
fact
they
didn’t
recall
seeing
it
certainly
is
not
contradiction.
the--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
that’s
in
the
record.
mr.
irving
anolik
judge
goldberg
testified
and
so
did
inspector
smyth
testify.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
rehnquist,
there
was
an
attempt
to
cross-examine
judge
goldberg
as
to
what
criteria
he
used
to
determine
what--
why
this
was
obscene
and,
indeed,
perhaps
to
determine
if
he
was
even
familiar
with
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court
in
roth
and
in
other
cases
because
i
don’t
think
we
have
a
right
to
assume
that
lower
court
judges
necessarily
are
always
conversant
with
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court.
in
an
adversary
hearing,
at
least
these
matters
could
be
called
to
the
attention
of
these
jurors
to
determine
“are
you,
in
fact,
judging
this
seizure
by
the
standards
set
down
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
or
is
it
some
visceral
reaction
that
you
are
motivated
by?”
mr.
irving
anolik
at
least
to
cross-examine
the
complainant
be
he
a
magistrate
or
for
inspector
smyth.
mr.
irving
anolik
he
was
the
magistrate
who
issued
the
search
warrant,
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
i
would
say
that
if
the
party
at
least
who
was
in
the
role
of
the
complainant.
the
problem
with
this
case,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
judge
goldberg
became
a
prosecution
witness,
so
to
speak,
in
this
case
saying
that
he
determined
that
the
film
was
obscene
and,
to
that
extent,
having
become
a
witness
at
the
trial,
counsel
at
least
tried
to
determine
what
standards
he
had
applied
and
they
did
not
permit
cross-examination
as
to
that
question.
i
am
not
saying--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
am
not
saying
that
necessarily,
in
all
cases,
i
would
say
that
where
a
detached
impartial
magistrate
issues
a
search
warrant
that
you
have
a
right
to
cross-examine
him
as
to
why
he
did
it.
if
i
interpret
it
saying
that,
i
didn’t
mean
to
imply
that,
justice
rehnquist.
i
am
saying
that
at
least
the
complainant,
in
this
case,
inspector
smyth.
at
least
to
that
extent,
cross-examination
should
be
permitted
and
an
opportunity
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
magistrate
the
precedence
and
the
holdings
of
this
court
and,
perhaps,
the
courts
of
new
york
as
to
what
the
definition
of
community
standards
are,
what
the
definition
of
obscenity
is
under
the
roth
testing
of
the
test.
that,
at
least,
should
have
been
permitted
and
ought
to
be
permitted
in
any
first
amendment
situation
case.
that
is
our
position,
justice
stewart.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
thought
it
was
reproduced.
mr.
irving
anolik
your
friend
from
the
state
seems
to
indicate
that
he
doesn’t
think
it’s
in
there.
mr.
irving
anolik
it--
if
it
were
to
follow
the
usual
search
warrant
situation,
it
would
say
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
search
warrant
should
issue,
and
he
applied
a
fourth
amendment
standard
to
a
search
and
seizure
situation.
that
is
what
would
obtain
here,
and
that
is
the
situation
which,
no
doubt,
motivated
justice
goldberg.
we
maintain
that
a
fourth
amendment
standard
may
not
be
applied
in
first
amendment
situations
such
as
this.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes?
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
would
certainly
be
a
full-scale
hearing.
they
presumably
have
to--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes?
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
not.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
this
is
the
state
of
new
york,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
county
of
new
york.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
would
say
that
they
would
have
to
prove
it
by
the
standard
appertainable
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
right,
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
don’t
think
preponderance--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
the
object
of
seizing
the
film
here
is
to,
in
effect,
take
the
film
away,
out
of
the
possession
of
the
individual
and,
while
it’s
true
that
is
evidence,
we
maintain
they
must
proceed
by
subpoena
and,
of
course,
with
the
subpoena
you
can
make
a
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena.
but,
in
a
first
amendment
situation,
we
would
ask
that
nothing
less
than
a
full
adversary
hearing--
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
if
it’s
an
injunction,
then
i
would
say
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
credible
evidence
might
be
sufficient.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
that
the
standard
that
you
would
use--
mr.
irving
anolik
in
effect,
i
would
say--
although
it
seems
to
be
rather
logical
to
say
that,
i
would
say,
in
effect,
that
would
have
to
be
our
position.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
would
say
that
perhaps
we
could
use
a
different
standard
because,
as
i
understand
it,
a
standard
as
to,
for
example,
a
fair
preponderance
might
be
sufficient
to
see
that
at
least
some
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
has
not
occurred.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
be
prepared,
as
i
say,
to
at
least
reanalyze
the
standard
of
proof,
in
view
of
the
way
you
set
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
be
willing
to
do
or
at
least
concede--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
it
is
my
position,
as
i
say,
that
nothing
less
than
a
full
adversary
hearing
where
a
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
obtained
should
be
had.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
would
say
that
would,
of
course,
would
seem
to
be
a
situation
where
you’d
have
a
jury
trial
perhaps
on
a
different
scale,
because
there
you’d
be
trying--
mr.
irving
anolik
an
individual.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
but
the
point
is,
in
the
one
case,
you’re
judging
the
film
itself.
in
the
other
case,
you’re
judging
whether
he
promoted
in--
obscenity.
it’s
a
little
bit
different
standard
there
because
it’s
section
235,
the
obscenity
section
235.05
that
we
have
promoting
obscenity.
so,
it’s
a
little
bit
different
standard
that
we’re
dealing
with.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes?
mr.
irving
anolik
the
first
hearing
would
determine
what
the
film
itself--
mr.
irving
anolik
what
happens?
n
the
first
hearing,
there
would
be
a
determination
of
whether--
as
to
whether
the
film
itself
is
obscene
under
appropriate
community
standards.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
he
showed
the
film?
no,
doubt
about
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
he--
i
think
that
we
have--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
think
you’d
have
to
show
that
he
had
knowledge
and
intent.
mr.
irving
anolik
to
show
an
obscene
film.
in
other
words,
we
maintain
that
there
is,
at
the
basis
of
a
criminal
statute,
at
least
that
degree
of
due
process
which
would
require
the
state
to
establish
that
this
man
knowingly
and
willfully--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
the--
i
think
you’d
have
to
show
some
intent.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
that
for
example,
this
man,
in
good
faith,
believes
this
was
not
an
obscene
film
because
it’s--
mr.
irving
anolik
he
has
testified,
that’s
right,
but
he
was
not
the
subject
of
the
other
hearing.
the
subject
of
the
other
hearing
was
the
film
itself.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
we
maintain
that
it
was
the
film
itself
which
is
the
criterion
of
the
other
hearing.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
difference
being
that,
in
the
one
case--
mr.
irving
anolik
the
practical
is
that,
in
the
one
case,
we’re
testing
out
whether
or
not
the
film
itself
should’ve
been
seized,
whether
or
not
it’s
in
fact
obscene.
let
us
assume
the
court
then
decides
that
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
defendant,
that
they
hold
that
the
film
was
obscene.
the
issue
then
is
did
he
promote--
if
he
pleads
not
guilty,
now,
it
may
be
that
he
was
found
in
the
projection
room.
it
may
be
that
he
was
found
taking
money,
but
that
would
not
automatically
presume
him
guilty.
having
plead
not
guilty,
he’d
be
entitled
to
a
trial
as
to
his
own--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
wouldn’t
think
so,
because
in
narcotics
cases
there,
again,
has
to
be
some
element
of
criminal
intent
and
knowledge
because,
frequently,
a
person
who’s
found
in
possession
of
heroin
and
there’s
a
chemical
analysis.
there’s
absolutely
no
doubt
that
the
matter
is
heroin
and
that
he
was
found
with
it
and
was
sold
to
an
agent.
that
does
not
mean
he’s
not
entitled
to
a
trial
in
the
merits.
mr.
irving
anolik
as
a
practical
effect,
i’ll
say
this.
that
i
have
seen
cases,
justice
marshall,
where
there
had
been
disagreements
or
acquittals
of
defendants
notwithstanding
the
fact
that,
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
they
lost
the
case
they
were
called.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
there
aren’t
too
many
of
those.
i’d
have
to
agree.
there
aren’t
too
many
of
those
because
you
are
taking
the
narcotics
here,
but
why
don’t
we
take
some
other
situation
where
we’re
not
dealing
with
anything
as
dramatic
as
narcotics,
where
we’re
dealing
with
something,
perhaps
the
possession
of
an
unloaded
gun
or
the
possession,
for
example,
of
the
material--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
your
honor,
as
i
said,
i--
if
you
noted,
i
was
willing
to
backtrack
a
little
bit
on
that
aspect.
i
would
say
that
i
perhaps
should
adopt
the
standard
of
a
fair
preponderance
for
that
purpose,
and
insist
upon
beyond
reasonable
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
trial.
as
i
say,
upon
analysis,
justice
marshall,
and
if
you
would
give
me
an
opportunity
perhaps
to
amend
my
rather
adamant
position
previously,
that
perhaps
upon
reflection
a
preponderance
test
should
be
used
in
the
initial
hearing
and
reasonable
doubt
in
the
trial
proper.
that
would
be
perhaps
a
more
reasonable
situation.
what--
an
adversary
hearing,
however,
of
some
sort
must,
of
necessity,
be
held,
we
maintain,
to
protect
a
first
amendment
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
justice
stewart?
mr.
irving
anolik
the
movie
would
have
to
be
there,
but
the
point
is
this.
it
should
not
be
in--
with
the
possession
of
the
district
attorney
because
assuming--
let’s
say
that
we
won
the
suppression
hearing.
they
said
it
should
not
have
been
seized.
under
new
york
law,
the
district
attorney
could
appeal
that
and
retains
possession
of
the
property
until
it
goes
through
the
appellate
process.
he
is
not
required
to
return
that
film
because
that’s
true
in
all
search
and
seizure
cases.
the
district
attorney
can
appeal
forthwith
if
he
says
he
cannot
proceed
with
the
case
and,
therefore,
he
retains
possession
of
that
until
it
goes
through
the
full
appellate
process.
we
do
not
have
a
concomitant
right
of
appeal
if
the
suppression
is
not
granted
because
we
would
have
to
either,
plead
guilty
and
then
appeal,
or
else
we
have
to
go
through
a
full
trial
and
then
appeal
for
the
judgment
of
conviction
before
we
could
appeal
that
question.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
would
work
by--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
a
subpoena
and
we
maintain
the
subpoena
is
perfectly
alright
because
there’s
a
contempt
power
behind
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct,
for
the
film.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
just--
mr.
irving
anolik
but
just
for
one
day,
not
for
weeks
or
months
or
years,
just
for
one
day,
just
for
the
purpose
of
showing
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
and
then
it’s
immediately
returned.
mr.
irving
anolik
i’d
say
that
they
would
have
to
schedule
a
showing.
on
the
subpoena,
you
are
to
bring
the
subpoena
on
the--
at
10
a.m.
on
monday,
whenever
it
might
be,
for
the
purpose
of
showing
it
to
the
court.
they
bring
it
there
at
that
time,
they
show
it
to
the
court,
and
they
take
it
right
back
to
the
theater.
mr.
irving
anolik
but,
that’s
true--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that’s
true
of
any
situation
where
you
have
subpoenaed
records.
as
i
understand,
a
subpoena
does
not
entitle--
mr.
irving
anolik
well--
but,
it’s
not
that
easy.
it
has
to
be
taken
to
particular
labs.
exhibitors
don’t
have
the
facilities
to
do
that
and,
also,
why
should
we
imply
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
any
citizen
without
proof
of
that?
i
mean,
why
is
it
that
the
district
attorney
can
do
no
wrong?
the
district
attorney
might
doctor
that
film,
for
all
we
know,
if
he
has
it
in
his
position.
why
should
we
assume
that
he
wouldn’t
do
that?i
mean,
if
this
is
custodia
legis
in
the
hands
of
an
individual,
it’s
his
property.
why
should
he
be
deprived
of
it
and
why
should
we--
mr.
irving
anolik
absolutely.
mr.
irving
anolik
not
only
contempt,
perhaps
forgery
prosecution
of
offering
a
forged
document.
i
mean,
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
inhibitions
that
can
be
done.
now,
sixth
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
held
that
adversary
hearing
should
be
held.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
what
happens
is
then,
it’s
true.
he’s
going
to
be
the
problem
of
his
film.
he’s
going
to
be
the
problem
of
his
film--
mr.
irving
anolik
pardon
me?
mr.
irving
anolik
i’m
sorry.
did
you
say
before
the
criminal
conviction?
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
hearing--
mr.
irving
anolik
and
if
it’s
only
the
adversary
hearing,
they
would
have
to
wait
for
a
conviction
on
the
merits,
we
would
maintain.
mr.
irving
anolik
before
that
was
done.
mr.
irving
anolik
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
say,
to
take
a
constant
position,
that
until
there’s
a
finding
of
guilt
by
a
court
that
the
film,
it
being
a
first
amendment
property
right
we’re
dealing
with--
mr.
irving
anolik
should
not
be
seized
at
all.
mr.
irving
anolik
we
don’t
think
that
present
situation
requires
that
to
be
seized.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
would
be
an
adversary
hearing
and
we--
mr.
irving
anolik
we
would
use
a
standard
of
a
fair
preponderance.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
as
promptly
as
possible.
mr.
irving
anolik
again,
through
subpoena,
it
is
displayed
to
the
court,
and
until
there’s
a
finding
of
guilty,
it
should
not
be
seized.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
eventually,
if
it’s
deemed
to
be
obscene
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
i
presume
they
could
seize
it
because
it
would
technically
be
contraband
at
that
point.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes?
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
so.
i
think
for--
like
a
video
tape
or
something
of
the
films?
mr.
irving
anolik
that
might
be--
that
would
probably
satisfy
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
that’s
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
