justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i--
justice
potter
stewart
is
a
copy
of
the
search
warrant
in
the
appendix
here?
i
don’t
seem
to
be
able
to
find
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
what
judge
goldberg
did
find--
he
didn’t
find
that
this
movie
was
obscene.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
did
he
recite?
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
anolik.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
visualize
this
adversary
hearing?
the
movie
would
have
to
be
there,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
brings
me
back
to
my
question.
how
do
you
visualize
that
the
final
adversary
hearing
will
work?
justice
potter
stewart
would
there
be
a
subpoena
first
to--
justice
potter
stewart
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
theater
owner--
justice
potter
stewart
to
produce
the
film
and
that
immediately
would
take
the
film
away--
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
projection
booth
and
deprive
all
these
people
of
their
first
amendment
rights
to
see
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
suggesting
that--
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
suggesting
that
the
subpoena
has
to
be--
that
the
hearing
has
to
be
within
a
matter
of
hours
after
the
subpoena?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there
could
be
ancillary
restraints
on
its
return
against
tampering
with
it
and
so
forth,
which
would--
justice
potter
stewart
which
would
subject
the
exhibitor
to
contempt
if
it--
justice
potter
stewart
just--
i
wasn’t--
i’m
not
finished
with
my
questions.
your
idea--
your
submission
is
that
there’d
be
a
subpoena
and
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
hearing
be
very,
very
prompt
after--
justice
potter
stewart
the
theater
owner
shows
up
in
response
to
this
subpoena
duces
tecum.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
let’s
assume
that
the
magistrate,
after
the
adversary
hearing,
finds
that
this
probably
is
or
that
the
prosecution
has
sustained
its
burden
of
proving
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
this
is
obscene,
and
then
what
happens?
does
he--
justice
potter
stewart
is
he?
wouldn’t
you--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
you
would
say
that
the
constitution
requires
that,
nonetheless,
the
film
be
returned
to
the
theater
until
or
unless
there’s
been
a
criminal
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
talking
about
this--
justice
potter
stewart
adversary
hearing
that
you
say
the
constitution
requires.
i’m
trying
to
find
out
what
it
is
in
your
hard
work.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that,
although
there’s
a
finding
by
the
magistrate
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
shows
that
this
is
an
obscene
film.
justice
potter
stewart
then,
you
say
that,
after
such
a
finding,
the
constitution
requires
that
the
film
be
returned
to
the
theater.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
see,
because
all
these
cases
in
these
briefs
talk
about
an
adversary
hearing
and
i
have
a
very
great
deal
of
trouble
visualizing
what--
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
counsel
had
in
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
alright
and--there’s
a
finding
that
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence
the
film
is
obscene,
then
you
say
the
constitution
then
requires
the
film
to
be
returned
to
the
theater?
justice
potter
stewart
immediately
or
very
promptly.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
case
comes
to
trial,
then
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it’s
subpoenaed
and
then
displayed
to
the
finder
of
the
fact,
the
jury
or
the
trial
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
it’s--
and
then,
assuming
it’s
a
criminal
trial,
then
the
man
may
be
punished
but
the
film
never
does
gets
seized,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you--
if
it
were
the
other
way,
then
the
state
concedes
and
holds
pending
what
you
say
is
necessarily
a
period
of
time
for
preparation?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i--
justice
potter
stewart
is
a

of
the

i
don’t
