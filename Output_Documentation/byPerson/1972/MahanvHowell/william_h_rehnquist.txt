justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frazier,
wouldn’t
there
be
some
questions
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
district
court
being
a
source
of
policy
judgments
as
to
what
factors
are
to
be
considered
other
than
numbers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
the
virginia
legislature
have
done
the
congressional
districting,
so
that
the
line
between
say
the
second
district
and
its
adjoining
district
were
the
same
as
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
state
district
that
you
are
talking
about,
the
same
fallacy
would
have
been
true
for
congressional
apportionment,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it’s
up
to
the
legislatures
to
where
they
draw
the
line
between
the
districts
and
conceivably
if
they
had
drawn
the
congressional
line
at
the
place
that
they
drew
the
state
district
line
here,
you
could
have
the
same
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
duval.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
you
determine
what
counties
and
cities
comprise
northern
virginia
for
the
purpose
of
your
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they’re
under
state
legislation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
the
principal
reason
for
your
suggesting
that
these
be
treated
as
a
group
for
comparison
with
other
areas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
duval,
couldn’t
we
count
on
that
new
general
assembly
if
it
decided
that
it
no
longer
wanted
to
prosecute
this
appeal,
that
so
advised
the
attorney
general?
