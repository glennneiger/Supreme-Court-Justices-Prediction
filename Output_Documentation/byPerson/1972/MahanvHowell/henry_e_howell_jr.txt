mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices,
i
represent
the
plaintiffs
in
the
suit
that
was
filed
on
march
3rd
challenging
the
validity
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
senate
reapportionment
of
council
as
senator
peter
babalas
of
norfolk.
our
case
was
separate,
but
we
come
up
here
on
a
unitary
opinion
that
dealt
with
two
separate
cases.
at
the
outset,
if
your
honors
please,
it’s
often
important
to
know
that
the
constitution
of
virginia
was
changed
since
the
day
that
i
had
the
privilege
of
sharing
the
side
with
the
distinguished
attorney,
mr.
edmund
campbell
and
argue
mann
v.
davis.
when
we
argued
mann
v.
davis,
the
rule
that
governs
reapportionment
of
congress
that
the
district
shall
be
contiguous
has
become
compact
and
contained
as
nearly
as
practicable
the
same
number
of
inhabitants
which
contained
in
one
section
of
our
constitution
and
that
language
was
not
embodied
in
another
section
which
merely
said,
that
we
should
reapportion
the
state
legislature
every
ten
years.
but
when
the
people
went
to
the
polls
in
1970
to
amend
the
constitution,
they
dictated
that
the
same
test
for
congressional
reapportionment,
governed
state
legislative
reapportionment.
so,
if
this
distinguished
tribunal
has
taken
the
virginia
case
to
hand
down
a
ruling
that
they
should
be
a
more
given
the
joints
when
it
comes
to
cutting
the
legislative
pie
into
a
100
slices
then
they
should
be
in
the
slicing
of
the
congressional
pie
into
10
slices,
it’s
the
wrong
case.
we
cited
in
our
brief
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i
understand.
but
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
your
honor,
please
but
judge
albert
bryan
pointed
out
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
mandate
in
virginia
had
been
underscored
so
that
in
our
constitution
we
have
anticipated
and
adopted
a
majority
opinion
in
the
preisler
kirkpatrick
gainst
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
your
honor,
please,
i
am
submitting
that
when
our
constitution
says
that
the
house
of
representative
of
the
united
states
and
the
members
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
delegates
shall
be
elected
from
the
districts
established
and
every
district
shall
be
composed
of
contiguous
compact
territory
and
shall
be
so
constituted
as
to
give
us
nearly
as
practicable
representation
in
proportion
to
the
population
of
a
district
that
in
that
state,
there
can
be
no
constitutional
difference
in
what
measures
up
to
the
test
of
nearly
as
practicable.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
right,
we
will
not
chase
that
rabbit
if
your
honor
please
because
it
is
not
necessary.
in
the
senate
case,
we
have
a
plan
involved
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
every
reapportionment
opinion
that
is
ever
been
handed
down
by
this
court.
and
at
that
point,
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
pull
out
of
the
appendix
a
map
of
the
city
of
norfolk
because
we
are
a
distinctive
city.
there
are
maybe
a
few
other
cities
that
can
brag
about
being
the
largest
naval
base
in
the
world,
but
i
don’t
think
so.
and
now,
in
the
light
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
it
is
all
in
this
map.
the
big
quite
area
that
looks
somewhat
like
snowfall
in
the
winter
time
is
a
naval
operating
base.
that’s
in
the
upper
left
hand
corner
of
the
exhibit.
that
could
be
what
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
that
district,
that
first
district
to
your
left
is
district
five,
the
middle
district
was
district
six
and
then
the
remainder
is
district
seven.
now,
we
are
focusing
attention
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
district
five.
behind
a
fence,
that
has
to
be
there
for
security
purposes,
the
united
states
census
delegated
to
the
navy
department
the
task
of
enumerating
sailors.
when
the
navy
has
enough
trouble
of
its
own
without
undertaking
the
100
years
of
experience,
the
department
of
commerce
has
acquired
through
the
census
department.
so,
you
will
find
in
the
exhibits,
if
your
honor
please
a
typical
military
approach
to
taking
the
census.
they
sent
them
on
to
aboard
the
ships,
signed
a
certificate
is
to
how
many
crew
members
are
assigned
to
vessels
“home-ported”
in
this
example
at
norfolk,
virginia
on
the
day
we
take
the
census.
count
on
as
if
they
lived
aboard
the
ships
and
had
no
family
homes
in
the
norfolk
area
and
in
that
mandate
and
i
do
not
blame
the
department
of
navy.
if
i
criticize
anybody
i
would
criticize
the
census
department
for
delegating
to
the
navy
a
very
sophisticated
task
and
that
is
of
counting
the
total
number
of
habitants
within
the
united
states
of
america.
but
having
seen
that
we
have
50,000
people
behind
that
fence,
if
we
were
to
just
take
this
arbitrary
census
tract,
census
tract
000999.
it
consists
of
these
little
white
lines
projecting
out
into
the
elizabeth
river
known
as
the
piers
at
the
naval
base
and
we
have
as
an
exhibit
the
total
number
of
vessels
that
were
“home-ported”
at
these
piers.
and
there
were
38,000
people
that
were
considered
as
being
residents
along
this
pier.
when
in
fact
--
now
we
are
not
just
relaying
upon
the
testimony
of
professor
reed
who
had
some
30
years
experience
as
a
census
enumerator
and
whose
documents
are
well
established
in
the
transcript,
but
we
had
un-contradicted
testimony
of
admiral
cob
who
was
a
commandant
of
the
fifth
naval
district
and
mr.
bergmannsheil,
the
assistant
administrative
from
management
to
the
fifth
naval
district
and
both
of
them
testified
without
contradiction
that
at
least
50%
of
the
people
that
were
counted
in
000999
along
those
piers
actually
lived
with
their
families,
their
wives
and
children
in
other
sections
of
the
general
area.
so,
if
your
honor
please,
on
this
we
are
going
to
subscribe
to
a
phantom
population
as
being
in
compliance
with
what
i
think
was
a
magnificent
principle
that
restored
representative
government
throughout
this
nation
and
state
legislative
bodies
and
in
congress
too.
if
we
go
for
phantom
populations,
we
have
destroyed
the
vitality
of
“one
person,
one
vote”
and
then
you
will
see
all
kind
of
phantom
schemes
for
artificially
complying
with
having
nearly
as
practicable,
the
same
number
of
inhabitants.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
the
enumeration
of
the
total
number
of
inhabitants
was
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
the
census.
the
census
was
first
taken
in
1790
for
the
sole
purpose
of
reapportioning
congress
and
the
un-contradicted
testimony
of
mr.
conrad
toper
(ph)
is
that
there
is
no
factor
considered
in
the
taking
of
the
census
that
is
relevant
to
state
legislative
reapportionment.
and
so,
i
say
to
you
that
the
enumeration
of
the
total
number
of
inhabitants
within
the
second
congressional
district
was
entirely
accurate
because
all
they
have
to
do
is
be
spread
through
that
total
area
and
these
people
were
there.
they
were
either
on
ships
or
living
in
apartments
and
houses
with
their
wives
and
children
like
every
other
american
who
has
a
job
on
land.
what
i
say
is
that
when
you
have
a
substantial
impact
of
people
who
might
find
and
fall
in
the
category
of
sailors
and
the
state
doesn't
want
to
take
the
time
to
find
where
they
actually
live,
whether
they
live
aboard
ship
or
live
with
their
wives
and
children
you
defuse
it
by
at
large
elections.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
not
when
they
are
artificial.
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
not
any.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
not
any.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
a
case
where
we
established
the
opinion
of
judge
albert
bryan
which
i
don’t
believe
can
be
blinked
away,
said
that
if
your
honor
please,
the
remainder
with
their
families
reside
for
most
part
and
other
sections
of
the
city
of
norfolk,
he
stated
that
it
was
factually
without
dispute
that
only
8,100
of
the
36,693
were
within
the
fifth
senatorial
district.
so,
we
have
an
undisputed
fact
of
the
eminent
three-judge
court
and
i
say
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
stop
throwing
factual
findings
of
a
lower
court
to
the
four
wins
and
we
come
here
in
the
rare
position
of
having
judge
albert
bryan
saying
that
it
was
an
undisputed
fact
that
the
people
just
weren’t
there.
the
ridicularity
of
going
for
this
artificial
population
count,
a
count
that
was
adopted
by
senate
privileges
in
elections
as
a
matter
of
convenience
would
be,
if
you
would
have
single
member
highest
districts
in
norfolk,
you
would
have
50,000
military
people
behind
the
fence
entitled
to
a
delegate.
so,
you
would
elect
admiral
cobb
soon,
most
of
the
enlisted
men
will
elect
admiral
cobb
and
then
when
we
call
the
session
on
the
general
assembly,
he
would
be
out
in
the
south
pacific
responding
to
a
breakout
in
the
far
east,
if
everything
then
go
alright
and
this
would
be
absolutely
ridiculous.
now,
the
house
of
delegates
recognized
that
and
went
for
at
large
district.
in
a
military
area
like
norfolk,
you
have
to
count
these
people
because
they
are
just
as
much
interested
in
their
children
living
in
rhode
island
park
or
commodore
park
in
norfolk.
they
are
just
much
interested
in
them
having
good
schools.
they
want
good
roads
to
travel
on
in
norfolk
and
virginia
until
they
get
inside
the
naval
base
and
then
uncle
sam
has
good
roads.
they’re
not
worried
about
what’s
inside
the
fence.
they
are
worried
about
what
is
on
the
outside
of
the
fence.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
no
sir.
the
census
figures
were
not
put
together
to
assist
in
state
legislative
reapportionment,
if
congress
wants
to
give
a
mandate
to
the
census
and
give
them
the
money
and
the
people.
mr.
conrad
toper
and
whoever
might
be
the
secretary
of
commerce,
it
was
mr.
stance
at
the
time
of
this
particular
taking,
they
will
be
happy
to
compute
and
get
figures
for
legislative
reapportionment.
i
am
saying
that
these
figures
are
100%
correct
for
allocating
the
ten
congressmen
in
virginia
because
you’re
slicing
the
pie
in
such
large
slices
that
you
diffuse
the
military
population
whether
they
would
be
hanging
on
the
end
of
the
convoy
escort
piers
or
living
in
a
townhouse
over
in
the
same
district.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
absolutely
not.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
it's
just
as
you
would
with
the
walk
out
here
to
get
a
little
breath
of
air
following
this
hectic
day
here
in
this
distinguished
tribunal
and
you
saw
a
black
round
sphere
laying
in
a
field
and
wanting
to
play
a
little
touch
football
with
justice
byron
white,
you
picked
it
up
and
threw
it
to
him
and
then
he
caught
it,
it
exploded.
it
is
good
as
a
bomb
but
it
was
poor
as
a
football.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
now,
let
me
get
that
right
on
point,
if
your
honor
please.
the
congress
has
not
told
the
department
of
commerce
to
have
the
census
taken,
so
that
you
could
slice
virginia
up
into
100
delegate
seats
and
40
senate
seats.
all
they
have
told
him
to
do
is
to
take
the
census,
so
we
can
slice
it
up
into
ten
congressional
seats
and
they
have
enumerated,
so
that
we
can
slice
it
up
in
ten
congressional
seats
because
norfolk
and
virginia
beach
constitute
the
second
congressional
district
and
we
diffuse
this
military
personnel.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
well,
that
could
not
happen
because
you
know
it
takes
46000
tenant
to
--
takes
465,000
people
to
get
a
congressman.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
it’s
nearly
impossible
to
do
so.
you
can’t
get
465,000
people
into
district
five
or
the
district
six
or
district
seven.
i
mean
it's
just
--
you
know
when
you
are
getting
a
slice
of
pie
that
big,
you
don’t
need
to
worry
about
the
preciseness.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
just
a
scintilla,
if
your
honor
please,
it
was
not
50%.
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what
small
percentage
lived
in
chesapeake
and
commuted
to
suffolk,
virginia,
but
it
was
just
a
scintilla.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i
suggest
if
the
record
is
read
with
the
care
which
characterizes
this
court,
you
will
find
that
there’s
no
evidence
to
show
that
any
recognizable
number
of
people
lived
outside
of
five,
six
and
seven.
and
so
what
now
--
we
show
that
98%
of
them
were
within
five,
six
and
seven.
we
couldn’t
go
looking
for
that
one
person
as
appellants.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
insofar
as
military
would
concern.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
they
counted
the
wife
of
this
sailor
in
her
home
in
district
six,
but
they
counted
the
sailor.
he
was
the
only
person
that
was
enumerated
where
he
worked
rather
than
where
he
lived.
senator
babalas
and
his
wife
were
counted
where
the
senator
lived
with
his
wife,
even
though
he
may
spent
half
of
his
time
in
richmond.
but
the
sailor
was
counted
on
board
of
ship.
so,
there
was
discrimination
in
the
basic
approach.
the
only
person
who
was
enumerated
by
occupation
rather
than
residence,
and
this
was
wrong.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
because,
if
your
honor
please,
we
did
not
have
sufficiently
precise
enumeration
on
a
house-by-house
basis.
the
navy
could
have
put
a
line,
an
additional
line
on
the
sampler.
do
you
live
with
your
wife
within
the
second
naval
district?
if
so,
put
your
address
and
then
we
could
have
done
it
but
the
navy
didn’t
put
that
line.
they
were
in
hurry
to
fight
a
war.
they
regretted
the
fact,
but
somebody
told
them
to
participate
in
the
census
and
they
got
rid
of
it
as
quick
as
they
could.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
in
an
area
like
norfolk,
i
do
not
believe
in
single-member
districts
because
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
no,
that’s
--
you
brought
me
to
a
very
interesting
point.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i
want
to
say
that
there
was
no
legislative
policy.
i
was
an
incumbent
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
they
had
said
it,
then
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that’s
the
plan
they
came
up
with
in
about
35
minutes
figuratively
speaking.
about
a
day
and
a
half
i’d
like
to
show
you,
there’s
no
expertise
behind
the
senate
plan.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
it's
politics
behind
it
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
well,
we
would
have
come
here
and
said
that
in
norfolk
where
the
blacks
are
a
minority
and
where
they
do
not
constitute
a
majority
in
either
one
of
the
three
senatorial
districts.
we
created
a
primary,
at
that
time
at
primarily
all
white
district
five,
a
primarily
all
white
district
seven
suburbia
and
then
in
the
middle
district,
we
came
up
with
about
60%
white
and
40%
black,
that’s
a
rough
approximation,
the
demographers
may
put
the
geometry
on
it,
but
that’s
roughly
it.
so,
where
we
now
have,
we’ve
elected
a
black
delegate.
no
one’s
ever
run
as
a
black
senator,
but
we
have
elected
a
black
delegate
in
the
house
at
large
but
if
we
set
up
this
bars
which
have
been
condemned
and
justice
douglas
has
gone
out,
but
a
magnificent
condemnation
of
bars
in
reapportionment.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i’d
say
that
single-member
districts
would
dilute
the
black
vote
in
a
city
like
norfolk,
if
you
know
the
balance
because
you’re
going
to
get
two
white
senators
who
are
not
going
to
a
single
black
lodge
or
church
and
they
are
going
to
have
a
deaf
ear
to
every
black
request
that
comes
as
we
try
to
appeal
to
the
majority
of
all.
right
now,
we
have
a
scramble
in
norfolk.
we
go
every
place,
and
the
most
of
the
outs
to
the
exbuala
(ph)
clubs,
to
the
italian
folks,
or
people
of
brick
background
black
and
white.
we
are
all
looking
for
votes,
we
go
all
over
the
city
and
everybody
gets
an
ear.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes
sir
my
time
is
up
and
i
do
not
wish
to
trespass.
i
would
merely
sit
down
by
saying,
that
if
you
will
read
my
brief,
you
would
see
that
the
incumbent
senators
were
given
the
option
to
have
single-member
or
multimember,
either
one
but
because
we
couldn’t
agree
that
had
to
do
it
overnight
and
we
round
up
with
what
we
did.
but
if
the
incumbent
senators
in
congressional
district
number
two
could
have
agreed,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
i
am
glad
to
say
we
don’t
have
too
many
people
against
us
today
insofar
as
virginia
beach
is
concerned
and
other
appellees.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices,
i
represent
the
plaintiffs
in
the
suit
that
was
filed
on
march
3rd
challenging
the
validity
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
senate
reapportionment
of
council
as
senator
peter
babalas
of
norfolk.
our
case
was
separate,
but
we
come
up
here
on
a
unitary
opinion
that
dealt
with
two
separate
cases.
at
the
outset,
if
your
honors
please,
it’s
often
important
to
know
that
the
constitution
of
virginia
was
changed
since
the
day
that
i
had
the
privilege
of
sharing
the
side
with
the
distinguished
attorney,
mr.
edmund
campbell
and
argue
mann
v.
davis.
when
we
argued
mann
v.
davis,
the
rule
that
governs
reapportionment
of
congress
that
the
district
shall
be
contiguous
has
become
compact
and
contained
as
nearly
as
practicable
the
same
number
of
inhabitants
which
contained
in
one
section
of
our
constitution
and
that
language
was
not
embodied
in
another
section
which
merely
said,
that
we
should
reapportion
the
state
legislature
every
ten
years.
but
when
the
people
went
to
the
polls
in
1970
to
amend
the
constitution,
they
dictated
that
the
same
test
for
congressional
reapportionment,
governed
state
legislative
reapportionment.
so,
if
this
distinguished
tribunal
has
taken
the
virginia
case
to
hand
down
a
ruling
that
they
should
be
a
more
given
the
joints
when
it
comes
to
cutting
the
legislative
pie
into
a
100
slices
then
they
should
be
in
the
slicing
of
the
congressional
pie
into
10
slices,
it’s
the
wrong
case.
we
cited
in
our
brief
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i
understand.
but
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
your
honor,
please
but
judge
albert
bryan
pointed
out
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
mandate
in
virginia
had
been
underscored
so
that
in
our
constitution
we
have
anticipated
and
adopted
a
majority
opinion
in
the
preisler
kirkpatrick
gainst
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
your
honor,
please,
i
am
submitting
that
when
our
constitution
says
that
the
house
of
representative
of
the
united
states
and
the
members
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
delegates
shall
be
elected
from
the
districts
established
and
every
district
shall
be
composed
of
contiguous
compact
territory
and
shall
be
so
constituted
as
to
give
us
nearly
as
practicable
representation
in
proportion
to
the
population
of
a
district
that
in
that
state,
there
can
be
no
constitutional
difference
in
what
measures
up
to
the
test
of
nearly
as
practicable.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
right,
we
will
not
chase
that
rabbit
if
your
honor
please
because
it
is
not
necessary.
in
the
senate
case,
we
have
a
plan
involved
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
every
reapportionment
opinion
that
is
ever
been
handed
down
by
this
court.
and
at
that
point,
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
pull
out
of
the
appendix
a
map
of
the
city
of
norfolk
because
we
are
a
distinctive
city.
there
are
maybe
a
few
other
cities
that
can
brag
about
being
the
largest
naval
base
in
the
world,
but
i
don’t
think
so.
and
now,
in
the
light
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
it
is
all
in
this
map.
the
big
quite
area
that
looks
somewhat
like
snowfall
in
the
winter
time
is
a
naval
operating
base.
that’s
in
the
upper
left
hand
corner
of
the
exhibit.
that
could
be
what
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
that
district,
that
first
district
to
your
left
is
district
five,
the
middle
district
was
district
six
and
then
the
remainder
is
district
seven.
now,
we
are
focusing
attention
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
district
five.
behind
a
fence,
that
has
to
be
there
for
security
purposes,
the
united
states
census
delegated
to
the
navy
department
the
task
of
enumerating
sailors.
when
the
navy
has
enough
trouble
of
its
own
without
undertaking
the
100
years
of
experience,
the
department
of
commerce
has
acquired
through
the
census
department.
so,
you
will
find
in
the
exhibits,
if
your
honor
please
a
typical
military
approach
to
taking
the
census.
they
sent
them
on
to
aboard
the
ships,
signed
a
certificate
is
to
how
many
crew
members
are
assigned
to
vessels
“home-ported”
in
this
example
at
norfolk,
virginia
on
the
day
we
take
the
census.
count
on
as
if
they
lived
aboard
the
ships
and
had
no
family
homes
in
the
norfolk
area
and
in
that
mandate
and
i
do
not
blame
the
department
of
navy.
if
i
criticize
anybody
i
would
criticize
the
census
department
for
delegating
to
the
navy
a
very
sophisticated
task
and
that
is
of
counting
the
total
number
of
habitants
within
the
united
states
of
america.
but
having
seen
that
we
have
50,000
people
behind
that
fence,
if
we
were
to
just
take
this
arbitrary
census
tract,
census
tract
000999.
it
consists
of
these
little
white
lines
projecting
out
into
the
elizabeth
river
known
as
the
piers
at
the
naval
base
and
we
have
as
an
exhibit
the
total
number
of
vessels
that
were
“home-ported”
at
these
piers.
and
there
were
38,000
people
that
were
considered
as
being
residents
along
this
pier.
when
in
fact
--
now
we
are
not
just
relaying
upon
the
testimony
of
professor
reed
who
had
some
30
years
experience
as
a
census
enumerator
and
whose
documents
are
well
established
in
the
transcript,
but
we
had
un-contradicted
testimony
of
admiral
cob
who
was
a
commandant
of
the
fifth
naval
district
and
mr.
bergmannsheil,
the
assistant
administrative
from
management
to
the
fifth
naval
district
and
both
of
them
testified
without
contradiction
that
at
least
50%
of
the
people
that
were
counted
in
000999
along
those
piers
actually
lived
with
their
families,
their
wives
and
children
in
other
sections
of
the
general
area.
so,
if
your
honor
please,
on
this
we
are
going
to
subscribe
to
a
phantom
population
as
being
in
compliance
with
what
i
think
was
a
magnificent
principle
that
restored
representative
government
throughout
this
nation
and
state
legislative
bodies
and
in
congress
too.
if
we
go
for
phantom
populations,
we
have
destroyed
the
vitality
of
“one
person,
one
vote”
and
then
you
will
see
all
kind
of
phantom
schemes
for
artificially
complying
with
having
nearly
as
practicable,
the
same
number
of
inhabitants.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
the
enumeration
of
the
total
number
of
inhabitants
was
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
the
census.
the
census
was
first
taken
in
1790
for
the
sole
purpose
of
reapportioning
congress
and
the
un-contradicted
testimony
of
mr.
conrad
toper
(ph)
is
that
there
is
no
factor
considered
in
the
taking
of
the
census
that
is
relevant
to
state
legislative
reapportionment.
and
so,
i
say
to
you
that
the
enumeration
of
the
total
number
of
inhabitants
within
the
second
congressional
district
was
entirely
accurate
because
all
they
have
to
do
is
be
spread
through
that
total
area
and
these
people
were
there.
they
were
either
on
ships
or
living
in
apartments
and
houses
with
their
wives
and
children
like
every
other
american
who
has
a
job
on
land.
what
i
say
is
that
when
you
have
a
substantial
impact
of
people
who
might
find
and
fall
in
the
category
of
sailors
and
the
state
doesn't
want
to
take
the
time
to
find
where
they
actually
live,
whether
they
live
aboard
ship
or
live
with
their
wives
and
children
you
defuse
it
by
at
large
elections.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
not
when
they
are
artificial.
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
not
any.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
not
any.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
a
case
where
we
established
the
opinion
of
judge
albert
bryan
which
i
don’t
believe
can
be
blinked
away,
said
that
if
your
honor
please,
the
remainder
with
their
families
reside
for
most
part
and
other
sections
of
the
city
of
norfolk,
he
stated
that
it
was
factually
without
dispute
that
only
8,100
of
the
36,693
were
within
the
fifth
senatorial
district.
so,
we
have
an
undisputed
fact
of
the
eminent
three-judge
court
and
i
say
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
stop
throwing
factual
findings
of
a
lower
court
to
the
four
wins
and
we
come
here
in
the
rare
position
of
having
judge
albert
bryan
saying
that
it
was
an
undisputed
fact
that
the
people
just
weren’t
there.
the
ridicularity
of
going
for
this
artificial
population
count,
a
count
that
was
adopted
by
senate
privileges
in
elections
as
a
matter
of
convenience
would
be,
if
you
would
have
single
member
highest
districts
in
norfolk,
you
would
have
50,000
military
people
behind
the
fence
entitled
to
a
delegate.
so,
you
would
elect
admiral
cobb
soon,
most
of
the
enlisted
men
will
elect
admiral
cobb
and
then
when
we
call
the
session
on
the
general
assembly,
he
would
be
out
in
the
south
pacific
responding
to
a
breakout
in
the
far
east,
if
everything
then
go
alright
and
this
would
be
absolutely
ridiculous.
now,
the
house
of
delegates
recognized
that
and
went
for
at
large
district.
in
a
military
area
like
norfolk,
you
have
to
count
these
people
because
they
are
just
as
much
interested
in
their
children
living
in
rhode
island
park
or
commodore
park
in
norfolk.
they
are
just
much
interested
in
them
having
good
schools.
they
want
good
roads
to
travel
on
in
norfolk
and
virginia
until
they
get
inside
the
naval
base
and
then
uncle
sam
has
good
roads.
they’re
not
worried
about
what’s
inside
the
fence.
they
are
worried
about
what
is
on
the
outside
of
the
fence.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
no
sir.
the
census
figures
were
not
put
together
to
assist
in
state
legislative
reapportionment,
if
congress
wants
to
give
a
mandate
to
the
census
and
give
them
the
money
and
the
people.
mr.
conrad
toper
and
whoever
might
be
the
secretary
of
commerce,
it
was
mr.
stance
at
the
time
of
this
particular
taking,
they
will
be
happy
to
compute
and
get
figures
for
legislative
reapportionment.
i
am
saying
that
these
figures
are
100%
correct
for
allocating
the
ten
congressmen
in
virginia
because
you’re
slicing
the
pie
in
such
large
slices
that
you
diffuse
the
military
population
whether
they
would
be
hanging
on
the
end
of
the
convoy
escort
piers
or
living
in
a
townhouse
over
in
the
same
district.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
absolutely
not.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
it's
just
as
you
would
with
the
walk
out
here
to
get
a
little
breath
of
air
following
this
hectic
day
here
in
this
distinguished
tribunal
and
you
saw
a
black
round
sphere
laying
in
a
field
and
wanting
to
play
a
little
touch
football
with
justice
byron
white,
you
picked
it
up
and
threw
it
to
him
and
then
he
caught
it,
it
exploded.
it
is
good
as
a
bomb
but
it
was
poor
as
a
football.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
now,
let
me
get
that
right
on
point,
if
your
honor
please.
the
congress
has
not
told
the
department
of
commerce
to
have
the
census
taken,
so
that
you
could
slice
virginia
up
into
100
delegate
seats
and
40
senate
seats.
all
they
have
told
him
to
do
is
to
take
the
census,
so
we
can
slice
it
up
into
ten
congressional
seats
and
they
have
enumerated,
so
that
we
can
slice
it
up
in
ten
congressional
seats
because
norfolk
and
virginia
beach
constitute
the
second
congressional
district
and
we
diffuse
this
military
personnel.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
well,
that
could
not
happen
because
you
know
it
takes
46000
tenant
to
--
takes
465,000
people
to
get
a
congressman.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
it’s
nearly
impossible
to
do
so.
you
can’t
get
465,000
people
into
district
five
or
the
district
six
or
district
seven.
i
mean
it's
just
--
you
know
when
you
are
getting
a
slice
of
pie
that
big,
you
don’t
need
to
worry
about
the
preciseness.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
just
a
scintilla,
if
your
honor
please,
it
was
not
50%.
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what
small
percentage
lived
in
chesapeake
and
commuted
to
suffolk,
virginia,
but
it
was
just
a
scintilla.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i
suggest
if
the
record
is
read
with
the
care
which
characterizes
this
court,
you
will
find
that
there’s
no
evidence
to
show
that
any
recognizable
number
of
people
lived
outside
of
five,
six
and
seven.
and
so
what
now
--
we
show
that
98%
of
them
were
within
five,
six
and
seven.
we
couldn’t
go
looking
for
that
one
person
as
appellants.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
insofar
as
military
would
concern.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
they
counted
the
wife
of
this
sailor
in
her
home
in
district
six,
but
they
counted
the
sailor.
he
was
the
only
person
that
was
enumerated
where
he
worked
rather
than
where
he
lived.
senator
babalas
and
his
wife
were
counted
where
the
senator
lived
with
his
wife,
even
though
he
may
spent
half
of
his
time
in
richmond.
but
the
sailor
was
counted
on
board
of
ship.
so,
there
was
discrimination
in
the
basic
approach.
the
only
person
who
was
enumerated
by
occupation
rather
than
residence,
and
this
was
wrong.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
because,
if
your
honor
please,
we
did
not
have
sufficiently
precise
enumeration
on
a
house-by-house
basis.
the
navy
could
have
put
a
line,
an
additional
line
on
the
sampler.
do
you
live
with
your
wife
within
the
second
naval
district?
if
so,
put
your
address
and
then
we
could
have
done
it
but
the
navy
didn’t
put
that
line.
they
were
in
hurry
to
fight
a
war.
they
regretted
the
fact,
but
somebody
told
them
to
participate
in
the
census
and
they
got
rid
of
it
as
quick
as
they
could.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
in
an
area
like
norfolk,
i
do
not
believe
in
single-member
districts
because
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
no,
that’s
--
you
brought
me
to
a
very
interesting
point.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i
want
to
say
that
there
was
no
legislative
policy.
i
was
an
incumbent
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
they
had
said
it,
then
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that’s
the
plan
they
came
up
with
in
about
35
minutes
figuratively
speaking.
about
a
day
and
a
half
i’d
like
to
show
you,
there’s
no
expertise
behind
the
senate
plan.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
it's
politics
behind
it
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
well,
we
would
have
come
here
and
said
that
in
norfolk
where
the
blacks
are
a
minority
and
where
they
do
not
constitute
a
majority
in
either
one
of
the
three
senatorial
districts.
we
created
a
primary,
at
that
time
at
primarily
all
white
district
five,
a
primarily
all
white
district
seven
suburbia
and
then
in
the
middle
district,
we
came
up
with
about
60%
white
and
40%
black,
that’s
a
rough
approximation,
the
demographers
may
put
the
geometry
on
it,
but
that’s
roughly
it.
so,
where
we
now
have,
we’ve
elected
a
black
delegate.
no
one’s
ever
run
as
a
black
senator,
but
we
have
elected
a
black
delegate
in
the
house
at
large
but
if
we
set
up
this
bars
which
have
been
condemned
and
justice
douglas
has
gone
out,
but
a
magnificent
condemnation
of
bars
in
reapportionment.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i’d
say
that
single-member
districts
would
dilute
the
black
vote
in
a
city
like
norfolk,
if
you
know
the
balance
because
you’re
going
to
get
two
white
senators
who
are
not
going
to
a
single
black
lodge
or
church
and
they
are
going
to
have
a
deaf
ear
to
every
black
request
that
comes
as
we
try
to
appeal
to
the
majority
of
all.
right
now,
we
have
a
scramble
in
norfolk.
we
go
every
place,
and
the
most
of
the
outs
to
the
exbuala
(ph)
clubs,
to
the
italian
folks,
or
people
of
brick
background
black
and
white.
we
are
all
looking
for
votes,
we
go
all
over
the
city
and
everybody
gets
an
ear.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes
sir
my
time
is
up
and
i
do
not
wish
to
trespass.
i
would
merely
sit
down
by
saying,
that
if
you
will
read
my
brief,
you
would
see
that
the
incumbent
senators
were
given
the
option
to
have
single-member
or
multimember,
either
one
but
because
we
couldn’t
agree
that
had
to
do
it
overnight
and
we
round
up
with
what
we
did.
but
if
the
incumbent
senators
in
congressional
district
number
two
could
have
agreed,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
i
am
glad
to
say
we
don’t
have
too
many
people
against
us
today
insofar
as
virginia
beach
is
concerned
and
other
appellees.
thank
you.
