justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand,
in
your
position,
mr.
frazier,
it
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
what
is
constitutionally
required
under
article
i,
section
2,
with
respect
to
congressional
apportionment
or
districting,
from
what
is
required
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
specifically,
the
equal
protection
clause
with
respect
to
reapportionment
of
state
legislatures
and
that
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
that
difference.
do
you
take
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
wesberry
against
sanders
which
was
based
on
article
i,
section
2
illustrates
that
in
particularly
when
one
reads
mr.
justice
clark’s
opinion
different
from
the
court
saying
that
in
wesberry
against
sanders,
he
would
apply
the
different
test
of
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
i
have
read
the
brief
of
the
city
of
norfolk,
who
is
an
appellee
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
that
the
city
is
not
going
to
be
represented
here
in
oral
argument
today
or
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
it
is
an
appellee
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
an
amicus,
but
it's
not
going
to
be
represented
in
oral
argument
today.
you
referred
to
that
brief
until
it’s
the
dramatic
presentation
of
the
basic
differences
between
virginia
beach
and
norfolk.
do
you
understand
as
brief,
do
you
understand
what
they’re
asking
the
court
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
in
an
appellee’s
brief
just
for
the
position
of
taking.
is
somebody
going
to
explain
that
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
i
would
trust
somebody
would
--
maybe
other
people
understand
this
brief
but
i
didn’t
and
i--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
quite
understandable,
of
course.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
their
position
as
to
what
they
think
the
court
ought
to
do,
that
it
thinks
norfolk,
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
here
with
the
virginia
constitution,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
federal
constitution,
so
then
can
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
any
case
is
the
right
case.
when
we
are
talking
about
--
if
that
issue
is
presented
under
the
federal
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
constitutional,
federal
constitutional
validity
of
what's
your
legislature
did,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
in
understanding
that
the
issue
here
is
the
federal
constitutional
validity
of
what
your
virginia
legislature
did.
now,
maybe
your
legislature
violated
your
own
state
constitution,
but
that’s
no
concern
to
us
here?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
would
your
argument
mr.
howell,
your
claim
here
is
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
accept
census
figures
for
the
reason
that
you
have
explained
that
census
figures
with
respect
to
a
certain
district
in
norfolk
were
invalid
and
unsound
and
inaccurate
because
the
census
with
respect
to
that
district
delegated
the
job
to
the
navy
which
did
it
by
counting
the
number
of
men
on
the
ships.
i
understand
your
claim
as
to
why
the
census
figures
were
invalid?
and
you
therefore
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
accept
census
figures.
now,
does
that
mean
that
in
every
case
it’s
up
to
the
courts
or
the
legislatures
to
go
behind
the
census
figures
and
if
they
find
it
for
some
reason
or
another,
they
think
they
are
inaccurate
that
they
are
not
allowed
to
follow
them?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument
but
i
wonder
where
it
leads.
you
say
it’s
--
a
state
is
not
constitutionally
permitted
to
use
the
figures
of
the
united
states
census?
justice
potter
stewart
can
any
litigant
come
in
and
say
these
census
figures
are
artificial
or
inaccurate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
require
a
court
to
make
its
own
census
or
a
state
legislature
to
make
its
own
census?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
that,
what
is
the
us
department
of
census
for?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
howell,
in
this
case
doing
exactly
or
aren’t
you,
what
the
chief
justice’s
question
suggests.
you’re
saying
that
the
constitution
requires
that
we
do
not
accept
the
census
figures
for
purposes
of
this
case.
isn’t
that
your
point,
am
i
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
tell
me
why
i
was
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
really
doesn’t
impress
me.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
the
basic
state
reapportionment?
justice
potter
stewart
following
up
my
brother
rehnquist’s
question,
does
tidewater
have
a
specific
kind
of
definition
or
meet
some
bounds
on
identity
just
as
northern
virginia
does?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand,
in
your
position,
mr.
frazier,
it
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
what
is
constitutionally
required
under
article
i,
section
2,
with

from
what
is

under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
specifically,
the
equal
protection
clause
with
respect
to
reapportionment
of
state
legislatures
and
that
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
that
difference.
do
you
take
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
wesberry
against
sanders
which
was
based
on
article
i,
section
2
illustrates
that
in
particularly
when
one
reads
mr.
justice
clark’s

different
from

against

justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
i
have
read
the
brief
of
the
city
of
norfolk,
who
is
an
appellee
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
that
the
city
is
not
going
to
be
represented
here
in
oral
argument
today
or
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
it
is
an
appellee
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
an
amicus,
but
it's
not
going
to
be
represented
in
oral
argument
today.
you
referred
to
that
brief
until
it’s
the
dramatic
presentation
of
the

differences
between
virginia
beach
and
norfolk.
do
you
understand
as

do
you
understand
what
they’re
asking
the
court
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
in
an
appellee’s
brief
just
for
the
position
of
taking.
is
somebody
going
to
explain
that
to
us?
justice

oh!
i

this

but
i
didn’t
and
i--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
quite

justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
their
position
as
to
what
they
think
the
court
ought
to
do,
that
it
thinks
norfolk,
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
here
with
the
virginia
constitution,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
federal
constitution,
so
then
can
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
any
case
is
the
right
case.
when
we
are
talking
about
--
if
that
issue
is
presented
under
the
federal
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
constitutional,
federal
constitutional
validity
of
what's
your
legislature
did,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
in
understanding
that
the
issue
here
is
the
federal
constitutional
validity
of
what
your
virginia
legislature
did.
now,
maybe
your
legislature
violated
your
own
state
constitution,
but
that’s
no
concern
to
us
here?
justice

how
