mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
as
counsel
pro
se.
i
was
a
lead
plaintiff
in
the
lower
court
action
which
we
challenge
the
virginia
general
assembly’s
house
of
delegate
plan,
and
as
the
result
of
which
the
lower
court
throughout
the
assembly’s
plan
adopted
its
own
reapportionment
plan
for
the
house
of
delegates.
i
am
interested
in
only
the
house
of
delegate
plan.
we
did
not
challenge
the
senate
plan
in
any
respect.
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
make
claim
to
the
court
that
i
diametrically
disagree
with
the
attorney
general
and
counsel
for
virginia
beach
who
apparently
believe
that
this
court
can
affirm
the
lower
court
only
on
the
kirkpatrick
versus
priesler
basis
of
mathematical
exactness.
this
is
certainly
not
the
case,
in
my
opinion,
and
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
there
is
ample
authority
by
which
you
could
affirm
the
lower
court’s
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
basic
cases
in
state
reapportionment
matters,
that
is
reynolds
versus
sims,
roman
versus
sincock
and
swann
versus
adams.
i’m
just
saying,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
i
believe
the
court
has
ample
authority
to
affirm
the
lower
court’s
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
long
standing
cases
such
as
reynolds,
roman
versus
sincock
and
swann
versus
adams.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
the
basic
state
reapportionment
cases.
i
am
well
aware
of
the
kirkpatrick
holding.
i
know
that
this
matter
is
under
discussion
in
the
court
here.
i’m
not
interested
in
the
outcome
in
this
case
because
i
rely
basically
on
the
swann
case
written
by
mr.
justice
white,
in
which
case,
the
court
held
that
the
issue
on
evaluating
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
state
legislative
reapportionment
scheme
is
whether
“there
has
been
faithful
adherence
to
a
plan
of
population-based
representation
with
such
minor
deviations
only
as
may
occur
in
recognizing
certain
factors
that
are
free
from
many
taint
of
arbitrariness
or
discrimination.”
now,
the
position
that
i
am
taking
here
is
that
the
assembly,
house
of
delegates’
plan
flunked
the
test
set
down
and
the
statement
i
just
read
you.
and
then
first
of
all
because
it
discriminated
against
northern
virginia
as
a
region
in
the
house
of
delegates
plan
and
that
was
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
and
within
the
band
that
i
just
mentioned.
this
court
in
1971,
specifically
condemned
a
plan
that
has
such
a
taint
of
arbitrariness
or
discrimination
in
abate
versus
mundt
in
which
justice
marshall
wrote
and
i
quote,
“we
have
underscored
the
danger
apportionment
structures
that
contain
a
built-in
bias
tend
to
favor
the
particular
geographic
areas
or
political
interests
or
which
necessarily
will
tend
to
favor
for
example
less
popular
districts
over
their
more
highly
populated
neighbors,”
citing
hadley
versus
junior
college
district.
now,
the
facts,
we
believe
clearly
show
discrimination
against
the
number
of
districts
and
seats
represented
in
the
northern
virginia
area.
thus
all
19
seats
in
northern
virginia,
delegate
seats
were
underrepresented
by
an
average
of
4.3%.
in
terms
of
population,
northern
virginia
was
underrepresented
by
38,100
persons.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
a
court
plan
reduces
the
--
by
about
half.
we
got
a
delegate,
another
delegate
is
given
to
us
to
even
it
out.
those
under
representation
is
corrected
and
spread
out
across
the
state.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
we
are
underrepresented
by
a
small
amount
as
of
the
1970
census
but
because
of
our
very
rapidly
growing
population,
our
population
as
of
august
1
actually
would
have
entitled
less
to
21
delegates,
not
just
20
or
19
but
21
under
the
46,485
ideal
population.
now,
under
the
assembly
passed
reapportionment
redistricting
plans,
in
the
conventional
redistricting
plan,
northern
virginia
was
entitled
to
a
--
by
its
population
to
20%
of
the
congressional
seats
and
it
got
them.
in
the
senate
plan,
it
got
20%
of
the
senate
seats.
but
in
the
house
plan,
it
was
given
only
19%
and
of
course
that’s
what
brought
us
in
the
court.
we
felt
that
this
discrimination
against
this
us
particularly
unfair
because
of
the
population
growth
trends.
northern
virginia
for
the
last
decade
and
now
is
growing
much
more
rapidly
than
the
rest
of
the
state.
in
the
last
decade,
its
growth
rate,
average
annual
growth
rate
was
three
times
that
of
the
rest
of
the
state.
and
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
decisions,
a
virginia
case
that
came
before
you
on
reapportionment,
davis
versus
mann
and
kilgarlin
versus
hill
and
then
kirkpatrick
that
it
is
proper
for
the
legislature
and
for
reapportioning
court
to
consider
the
matter
of
growth
and
population.
in
kilgarlin
in
fact,
the
court
approved
a
over
representation
of
one
particular
area
because
the
district
court
showed
that
that
was
a
very
rapidly
growing
district.
though
we
say
that
the
assembly
plan
not
only
discriminated
against
northern
virginia,
but
the
other
side
of
it
was
that
there
was
substantial
over
representation
or
a
bias
in
favor
of
the
tidewater
area
and
thus
as
to
11
tidewater
delegate
seats
and
there
was
an
over
representation
by
an
average
of
7%
per
seat.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
it
is
a
--
for
a
number
of
purposes,
it
is
a
state
planning
district,
it’s
the
counties
of
arlington,
fairfax,
loudoun
and
prince
william
and
the
cities
of
alexandria,
fairfax
and
falls
church.
they’re
considered
for
certain
planning
purposes
to
be
a
separate
planning
district.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
yes,
under
state
legislation.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
yes,
it
was
a
convenient
way
of
considering
northern
virginia
as
a
district
already
regularized
by
state
law.
in
the
same
way
most
of
the
tidewater
jurisdictions
are
lumped
in
a
particular
planning
district
down
there.
when
i
speak
of
tidewater,
i’m
again
speaking
of
a
planning
district
identified
in
affect
the
tidewater
communities.
as
i
say,
11
tidewater
delegates
seats
were
overrepresented
by
7%
a
piece.
the
population
in
the
tidewater
would
represent
an
over
representation
of
36,650
persons.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
that
i
have
reported
to
you,
the
lower
court,
we
say
found
that
there
was
discrimination
on
a
built-in
bias
against
northern
virginia
and
favor
of
tidewater,
not
in
those
exact
words
but
the
lower
court
found
pervasive
under
representation
in
districts
in
northern
virginia,
and
over
representation
in
tidewater.
as
a
result
of
which,
one
delegate
seat
was
removed
from
tidewater
and
transferred
to
northern
virginia
to
eliminate
this
built-in
bias.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
yes
sir.
there
is
a
planning,
at
least
there
is
a
planning
district
under
state
laws
set
forth
in
my
brief
at
page
4
here,
as
used
here
in
tidewater
area
means
the
counties
of
isle
of
wight,
mount
simon,
south
hampton,
cities
of
chesapeake,
franklin,
norfolk,
portsmouth,
suffolk
and
virginia
beach.
for
certain
state
purposes
these
jurisdictions
are
grouped
in
state
planning
district
20.
now,
my
second
point
is
that
the
--
of
course
were
objectionable
population
deviations
in
this
plan
that
do
not
meet
the
swann
test
of
minor
variations.
i
emphasize
this
only
really
as
these
deviations
reflect
the
bias
and
discrimination
that
we
believe
was
present
in
the
house
of
delegates
plan
enacted
by
the
legislature.
percentage
wise,
including
all
the
districts
and
there
were
four
floaters
here,
the
overall
variation
from
population
equality
between
smallest
and
biggest
district
was
23.6%.
the
total
population
difference
between
biggest
and
smallest
districts
was
10,973
persons
and
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
abate,
justice
marshall
said
that,
and
there
the
11.9%
was
the
total
deviation
which
the
court
upheld
because
of
various
factors.
justice
marshall
said,
“and
nothing
we
say
today
should
be
taken
to
imply
that
even
these
factors,
those
that
were
considered
to
uphold
the
11.9%
degree
of
deviation,
justifies
substantially
greater
deviations
from
population
equality.”
i
might
also
note
in
passing
that
the
23.6
total
deviation
in
the
legislator's
plan
--
the
legislature's
plan
is
almost
doubled
at
10-15%
variation
between
largest
and
smallest
districts
which
justice
white
said
in
his
dissent
in
kirkpatrick
as
a
personal
rule
of
thumb
wouldn’t
bother
him
too
much.
our
third
point
is
that
the
justification
which
the
state
of
virginia
beach
relies
on,
presents
for
these
variations
even
though
we
say
they
can't
be
justified
because
they
weren’t
minor
but
the
one
the
state
relies
on,
the
only
one,
simply
doesn’t
hold
water,
in
that
the
state
has
not
consistently
applied
a
respect
for
the
integrity
of
boundary
lines
in
drawing
its
reapportionment
plans
and
that
includes
the
house
of
delegates
plan.
as
governor,
lieutenant
governor
howell
pointed
out
our
1970
constitution
requires
that
every
electoral
district
without
any
distinction
between
the
house
of
delegates
districts,
senate
districts
or
congressional
districts
comply
with
the
population,
equal
population
principle.
also
all
of
the
reapportionment,
redistricting
plans
adopted
by
the
virginia
general
assembly
disregards
subdivision
lines
in
one
degree
or
another.
the
congressional
and
senate
plans
in
many
respects,
the
house
of
delegates
reapportionment
plan
in
the
case
of
one
county.
but
beyond
that,
the
house
of
delegates
plan
has
a
board
provision
in
it
which
opens
the
door
to
frequent
violations
of
the
integrity
of
subdivision
lines.
that
is
that
act
says
that
the
description
of
all
legislative
districts
are
final
on
the
effective
date
of
enactment,
march
1,
1971,
notwithstanding
future
boundary
changes
by
annexation,
merger,
consolidation
or
the
voiding
of
boundary
changes.
now,
at
the
present
time,
half
a
dozen
of
cases
pending
in
virginia
in
the
federal
or
state
courts
in
which
are
the
counties
are
seeking
to
repeal
annexation
of
part
of
their
land
for
various
reasons
and
having
been
annexed
before
march
01,
1971
by
adjacent
city,
where
cities
are
trying
to
bite
off
chunks
in
neighboring
counties.
and
any
or
all
of
these
cases,
the
result
could
be
a
disregard
of
subdivision
lines
because
if
in
effect
a
city
where
compelled
to
disgorge
a
part
of
a
county,
annexed
prior
to
march
01,
1971,
then
of
course,
the
line
would
pick
up
a
part
of
the
county,
the
existing
legislative
district.
or
if
a
city
prevails
in
annexing
part
of
the
county
in
the
future,
and
there
are
three
such
cases
now
pending,
then
a
legislated
district
would
cut
part
of
the
city.
my
fourth
point
is
directed
to
appellant’s
main
thrust
here
that
the
lower
court
should
not
have
formulated
its
own
plan
but
rather
should
have
sent
the
plan
back
to
the
general
assembly
for
action.
now,
it’s
obvious
that
in
most
cases,
court
should
leave
reapportionment
to
the
legislature.
the
point
is
that
in
this
case,
there
is
simply
wasn’t
time
to
do
it
or
havoc
would
have
been
created
with
the
elective
processes
of
virginia.
the
primary
election
set
by
law
for
june
8
had
already
once
been
postponed
in
this
case.
candidates
for
the
general
assembly
running
in
those
primaries
were
to
file
for
revised
districts
within
two
weeks
after
the
court
handed
down
its
plan.
and
it
seems
perfectly
clear
that
the
lower
court
could
not
as
a
practical
matter,
have
given
guidelines
to
the
assembly,
sent
the
matter
back
to
the
assembly,
received
back
whatever
plan
they
developed,
reviewed
it,
modified
it,
held
hearings,
ordered
in
to
effect
without
great
disruption
to
virginia’s
elective
procedures.
for
example,
it
would
have
obviously
compressed
to
the
very
end
the
filing
dates
for
candidates.
the
primary
would
certainly
–
probably
had
to
been
postponed
for
the
second
time
from
september
14.
campaigns
would
have
been
compressed
and
perhaps
the
general
election
would
have
to
been
postponed.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
what
the
lower
court
did
was
entirely
proper
in
accordance
with
the
holding
and
opinion
in
reynolds
versus
sims
where
the
court
stated
that
lower
courts
would
have
a
wide
latitude
in
developing
“remedial
techniques”
and
that
these
techniques
“will
probably
often
differed
depending
on
local
conditions.”
the
court
there
further
stated
and
i
think
it’s
particularly
pertinent
to
this
case
that
in
a
warning
or
withholding
immediate
relief
the
court
is
entitled
to
and
should
consider
the
proximity
of
a
forthcoming
election
and
the
mechanics
and
complexities
of
state
election
laws
and
should
act
and
rely
up
on
general
equitable
principles.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
beans,
the
discretion
of
reapportioning
court
is
not
unlimited
but
it
is
certainly
broad.
i
can
tell
that
the
court
proceeded
properly
and
in
accordance
with
equitable
principles.
first
of
all
and
most
important
to
us
it
abolished
the
discrimination
we
complained
of,
and
gave
us
the
additional
delegate
we
are
entitled
to.
also
acting
reasonable,
i
believe,
because
it
took
the
assembly’s
house
of
delegate
plan
and
simply
modified
it
as
necessary
to
reduce
the
population
deviations
by
about
one
half,
the
result
being
that
the
court’s
plan
in
virginia,
we
have
134
counties
and
cities.
the
courts
plan
found
it
necessary
to
cross
boundary
lines
in
the
case
of
only
12
of
these
counties
and
cities.
so,
i
believe
and
submit
to
you
that
the
court’s
plan
was
entirely
reasonable
and
proper.
and
finally,
your
honors,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
submit
that
it’s
unnecessary
for
the
supreme
court
to
further
consider
this
case
at
this
stage.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
remind
you
that
the
appeal
here
is
from
an
interlocutory
order
below.
also,
the
virginia
general
assembly
will
meet
next
month
at
a
regular
session
and
under
the
clear
holding
in
connor
versus
williams,
it
could
have
caused
at
that
time
enact
or
reenact
any
reapportionment
legislation
it
saw
fit,
subject
only
of
course
to
proper
constitutional
considerations.
now
if
it
does
so,
at
the
coming
general
assembly,
that
plan
presumably
would
be
referred
back
to
the
lower
court
for
consideration
and
modification
perhaps.
if
then,
further
appeals
are
taken
to
this
court,
the
situation
deemed
desirable
by
the
court
in
connor
versus
williams
will
then
occur.
the
court
will
then
have
it
--
will
then
have
which
it
does
not
now
have
a
final
order
before
it
on
appeal
covering
the
entire
state.
as
i
say,
it
is
only
an
interlocutory
order
that
is
before
you
now.
now,
if
on
the
other
hand
the
general
assembly
and
it
is
much
more
likely
fails
to
enact
a
new
plan
of
reapportionment,
its
continued
inaction
will
demonstrate
very
clearly,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
the
assembly
now
has
no
objection
whatsoever
to
the
district
court’s
plan.
and
this,
as
a
matter
of
practicalities,
i
believe
is
the
actual
situation.
here
are
the
facts;
in
1971,
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
my
good
friend
mr.
miller
was
asked
to
take
this
appeal
by
the
1971
assembly
elected
under
the
old
law.
since
then,
a
new
general
assembly
has
been
elected
and
is
sitting
and
acting
--
acted
at
the
assembly
session
earlier
this
year
and
passed
laws
for
the
government
of
virginia.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
i
think
it
might
well
do
so.
that
is
a
perfectly
good
contingency,
i
believe
and
at
the
past
72
session,
your
honors,
the
house
of
delegates
did
not
even
consider
much
less
enact
as
it
could
have
done
under
connor
versus
williams,
any
new
reapportionment
legislation.
the
clarification
being
that
the
last
thing
the
house
of
delegates,
the
present
house
of
delegates
wants
is
a
reversal
of
the
reapportionment
plan
under
which
they
were
elected.
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
under
the
circumstances
here
present
where
the
legislative
body
elected
and
acting,
under
a
district
court
plan,
a
reversal
of
the
lower
court’s
plan
will
be
confusing
to
the
voters,
difficult
for
candidates
and
certainly
not
my
judgment
in
the
best
interest
the
people
of
virginia.
for
these
reasons,
your
honors,
i
submit
that
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
and
the
counsel
for
virginia
beach
may
will
be
the
only
persons
in
the
commonwealth
who
are
desirous
of
seeing
this
appeal,
their
appeal
succeed.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
no,
your
honor.
in
the
assembly,
during
the
discussion
of
the
plan
there,
we
at
northern
virginia
did
submit
plans
that
we
felt
would
prevent
any
discrimination
against
us,
but
they
were
rejected.
when
we
came
before
the
lower
court,
of
course,
our
principal
interest
was
in
the
northern
virginia
region
and
not
in
the
state
as
whole;
we
therefore,
did
not
propose
the
statewide
plan.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
we
proposed
single-member
districts
in
the
assembly
and
that’s
what
we
desired,
but
we
gave
up
that
contention
after
chavis
versus
whitcomb.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
that
issue
is
not
here.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
in
northern
virginia
--
in
my
case,
we
felt
that
a
division
of
northern
virginia
to
two
districts
of
five
and
six
delegates
was
simply
preferable
to
one
of
11
districts.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
that
issue
is
not
here.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
those
issues
were
all
dropped
at
the
lower
level.
in
conclusion
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
who
lost
his
bark
on
these
appellate
seats
in
1971
with
a
crew
of
many
supporters
whom
i
might
say
as
you
proceed,
he
is
a
very
fine
attorney
and
a
close
friend
of
mine,
now
finds
himself
in
a
situation
reminiscent
i
say
of
coleridge's
“ancient
mariner
-
alone,
alone,
all
all
alone,
alone
on
a
wide,
wide
sea.”
the
fact
is
that
the
attorney
general’s
1971
crew
has
left
him
and
a
new
crew
is
sitting
back
in
port
in
richmond
hopeful
that
his
vessel,
this
appeal
will
sink
without
trace.
i
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court’s
order
or
alternately
to
dismiss
the
appeals
herein
without
prejudice.
thank
you.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
as
counsel
pro
se.
i
was
a
lead
plaintiff
in
the
lower
court
action
which
we
challenge
the
virginia
general
assembly’s
house
of
delegate
plan,
and
as
the
result
of
which
the
lower
court
throughout
the
assembly’s
plan
adopted
its
own
reapportionment
plan
for
the
house
of
delegates.
i
am
interested
in
only
the
house
of
delegate
plan.
we
did
not
challenge
the
senate
plan
in
any
respect.
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
make
claim
to
the
court
that
i
diametrically
disagree
with
the
attorney
general
and
counsel
for
virginia
beach
who
apparently
believe
that
this
court
can
affirm
the
lower
court
only
on
the
kirkpatrick
versus
priesler
basis
of
mathematical
exactness.
this
is
certainly
not
the
case,
in
my
opinion,
and
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
there
is
ample
authority
by
which
you
could
affirm
the
lower
court’s
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
basic
cases
in
state
reapportionment
matters,
that
is
reynolds
versus
sims,
roman
versus
sincock
and
swann
versus
adams.
i’m
just
saying,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
i
believe
the
court
has
ample
authority
to
affirm
the
lower
court’s
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
long
standing
cases
such
as
reynolds,
roman
versus
sincock
and
swann
versus
adams.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
the
basic
state
reapportionment
cases.
i
am
well
aware
of
the
kirkpatrick
holding.
i
know
that
this
matter
is
under
discussion
in
the
court
here.
i’m
not
interested
in
the
outcome
in
this
case
because
i
rely
basically
on
the
swann
case
written
by
mr.
justice
white,
in
which
case,
the
court
held
that
the
issue
on
evaluating
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
state
legislative
reapportionment
scheme
is
whether
“there
has
been
faithful
adherence
to
a
plan
of
population-based
representation
with
such
minor
deviations
only
as
may
occur
in
recognizing
certain
factors
that
are
free
from
many
taint
of
arbitrariness
or
discrimination.”
now,
the
position
that
i
am
taking
here
is
that
the
assembly,
house
of
delegates’
plan
flunked
the
test
set
down
and
the
statement
i
just
read
you.
and
then
first
of
all
because
it
discriminated
against
northern
virginia
as
a
region
in
the
house
of
delegates
plan
and
that
was
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
and
within
the
band
that
i
just
mentioned.
this
court
in
1971,
specifically
condemned
a
plan
that
has
such
a
taint
of
arbitrariness
or
discrimination
in
abate
versus
mundt
in
which
justice
marshall
wrote
and
i
quote,
“we
have
underscored
the
danger
apportionment
structures
that
contain
a
built-in
bias
tend
to
favor
the
particular
geographic
areas
or
political
interests
or
which
necessarily
will
tend
to
favor
for
example
less
popular
districts
over
their
more
highly
populated
neighbors,”
citing
hadley
versus
junior
college
district.
now,
the
facts,
we
believe
clearly
show
discrimination
against
the
number
of
districts
and
seats
represented
in
the
northern
virginia
area.
thus
all
19
seats
in
northern
virginia,
delegate
seats
were
underrepresented
by
an
average
of
4.3%.
in
terms
of
population,
northern
virginia
was
underrepresented
by
38,100
persons.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
a
court
plan
reduces
the
--
by
about
half.
we
got
a
delegate,
another
delegate
is
given
to
us
to
even
it
out.
those
under
representation
is
corrected
and
spread
out
across
the
state.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
we
are
underrepresented
by
a
small
amount
as
of
the
1970
census
but
because
of
our
very
rapidly
growing
population,
our
population
as
of
august
1
actually
would
have
entitled
less
to
21
delegates,
not
just
20
or
19
but
21
under
the
46,485
ideal
population.
now,
under
the
assembly
passed
reapportionment
redistricting
plans,
in
the
conventional
redistricting
plan,
northern
virginia
was
entitled
to
a
--
by
its
population
to
20%
of
the
congressional
seats
and
it
got
them.
in
the
senate
plan,
it
got
20%
of
the
senate
seats.
but
in
the
house
plan,
it
was
given
only
19%
and
of
course
that’s
what
brought
us
in
the
court.
we
felt
that
this
discrimination
against
this
us
particularly
unfair
because
of
the
population
growth
trends.
northern
virginia
for
the
last
decade
and
now
is
growing
much
more
rapidly
than
the
rest
of
the
state.
in
the
last
decade,
its
growth
rate,
average
annual
growth
rate
was
three
times
that
of
the
rest
of
the
state.
and
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
decisions,
a
virginia
case
that
came
before
you
on
reapportionment,
davis
versus
mann
and
kilgarlin
versus
hill
and
then
kirkpatrick
that
it
is
proper
for
the
legislature
and
for
reapportioning
court
to
consider
the
matter
of
growth
and
population.
in
kilgarlin
in
fact,
the
court
approved
a
over
representation
of
one
particular
area
because
the
district
court
showed
that
that
was
a
very
rapidly
growing
district.
though
we
say
that
the
assembly
plan
not
only
discriminated
against
northern
virginia,
but
the
other
side
of
it
was
that
there
was
substantial
over
representation
or
a
bias
in
favor
of
the
tidewater
area
and
thus
as
to
11
tidewater
delegate
seats
and
there
was
an
over
representation
by
an
average
of
7%
per
seat.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
it
is
a
--
for
a
number
of
purposes,
it
is
a
state
planning
district,
it’s
the
counties
of
arlington,
fairfax,
loudoun
and
prince
william
and
the
cities
of
alexandria,
fairfax
and
falls
church.
they’re
considered
for
certain
planning
purposes
to
be
a
separate
planning
district.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
yes,
under
state
legislation.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
yes,
it
was
a
convenient
way
of
considering
northern
virginia
as
a
district
already
regularized
by
state
law.
in
the
same
way
most
of
the
tidewater
jurisdictions
are
lumped
in
a
particular
planning
district
down
there.
when
i
speak
of
tidewater,
i’m
again
speaking
of
a
planning
district
identified
in
affect
the
tidewater
communities.
as
i
say,
11
tidewater
delegates
seats
were
overrepresented
by
7%
a
piece.
the
population
in
the
tidewater
would
represent
an
over
representation
of
36,650
persons.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
that
i
have
reported
to
you,
the
lower
court,
we
say
found
that
there
was
discrimination
on
a
built-in
bias
against
northern
virginia
and
favor
of
tidewater,
not
in
those
exact
words
but
the
lower
court
found
pervasive
under
representation
in
districts
in
northern
virginia,
and
over
representation
in
tidewater.
as
a
result
of
which,
one
delegate
seat
was
removed
from
tidewater
and
transferred
to
northern
virginia
to
eliminate
this
built-in
bias.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
yes
sir.
there
is
a
planning,
at
least
there
is
a
planning
district
under
state
laws
set
forth
in
my
brief
at
page
4
here,
as
used
here
in
tidewater
area
means
the
counties
of
isle
of
wight,
mount
simon,
south
hampton,
cities
of
chesapeake,
franklin,
norfolk,
portsmouth,
suffolk
and
virginia
beach.
for
certain
state
purposes
these
jurisdictions
are
grouped
in
state
planning
district
20.
now,
my
second
point
is
that
the
--
of
course
were
objectionable
population
deviations
in
this
plan
that
do
not
meet
the
swann
test
of
minor
variations.
i
emphasize
this
only
really
as
these
deviations
reflect
the
bias
and
discrimination
that
we
believe
was
present
in
the
house
of
delegates
plan
enacted
by
the
legislature.
percentage
wise,
including
all
the
districts
and
there
were
four
floaters
here,
the
overall
variation
from
population
equality
between
smallest
and
biggest
district
was
23.6%.
the
total
population
difference
between
biggest
and
smallest
districts
was
10,973
persons
and
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
abate,
justice
marshall
said
that,
and
there
the
11.9%
was
the
total
deviation
which
the
court
upheld
because
of
various
factors.
justice
marshall
said,
“and
nothing
we
say
today
should
be
taken
to
imply
that
even
these
factors,
those
that
were
considered
to
uphold
the
11.9%
degree
of
deviation,
justifies
substantially
greater
deviations
from
population
equality.”
i
might
also
note
in
passing
that
the
23.6
total
deviation
in
the
legislator's
plan
--
the
legislature's
plan
is
almost
doubled
at
10-15%
variation
between
largest
and
smallest
districts
which
justice
white
said
in
his
dissent
in
kirkpatrick
as
a
personal
rule
of
thumb
wouldn’t
bother
him
too
much.
our
third
point
is
that
the
justification
which
the
state
of
virginia
beach
relies
on,
presents
for
these
variations
even
though
we
say
they
can't
be
justified
because
they
weren’t
minor
but
the
one
the
state
relies
on,
the
only
one,
simply
doesn’t
hold
water,
in
that
the
state
has
not
consistently
applied
a
respect
for
the
integrity
of
boundary
lines
in
drawing
its
reapportionment
plans
and
that
includes
the
house
of
delegates
plan.
as
governor,
lieutenant
governor
howell
pointed
out
our
1970
constitution
requires
that
every
electoral
district
without
any
distinction
between
the
house
of
delegates
districts,
senate
districts
or
congressional
districts
comply
with
the
population,
equal
population
principle.
also
all
of
the
reapportionment,
redistricting
plans
adopted
by
the
virginia
general
assembly
disregards
subdivision
lines
in
one
degree
or
another.
the
congressional
and
senate
plans
in
many
respects,
the
house
of
delegates
reapportionment
plan
in
the
case
of
one
county.
but
beyond
that,
the
house
of
delegates
plan
has
a
board
provision
in
it
which
opens
the
door
to
frequent
violations
of
the
integrity
of
subdivision
lines.
that
is
that
act
says
that
the
description
of
all
legislative
districts
are
final
on
the
effective
date
of
enactment,
march
1,
1971,
notwithstanding
future
boundary
changes
by
annexation,
merger,
consolidation
or
the
voiding
of
boundary
changes.
now,
at
the
present
time,
half
a
dozen
of
cases
pending
in
virginia
in
the
federal
or
state
courts
in
which
are
the
counties
are
seeking
to
repeal
annexation
of
part
of
their
land
for
various
reasons
and
having
been
annexed
before
march
01,
1971
by
adjacent
city,
where
cities
are
trying
to
bite
off
chunks
in
neighboring
counties.
and
any
or
all
of
these
cases,
the
result
could
be
a
disregard
of
subdivision
lines
because
if
in
effect
a
city
where
compelled
to
disgorge
a
part
of
a
county,
annexed
prior
to
march
01,
1971,
then
of
course,
the
line
would
pick
up
a
part
of
the
county,
the
existing
legislative
district.
or
if
a
city
prevails
in
annexing
part
of
the
county
in
the
future,
and
there
are
three
such
cases
now
pending,
then
a
legislated
district
would
cut
part
of
the
city.
my
fourth
point
is
directed
to
appellant’s
main
thrust
here
that
the
lower
court
should
not
have
formulated
its
own
plan
but
rather
should
have
sent
the
plan
back
to
the
general
assembly
for
action.
now,
it’s
obvious
that
in
most
cases,
court
should
leave
reapportionment
to
the
legislature.
the
point
is
that
in
this
case,
there
is
simply
wasn’t
time
to
do
it
or
havoc
would
have
been
created
with
the
elective
processes
of
virginia.
the
primary
election
set
by
law
for
june
8
had
already
once
been
postponed
in
this
case.
candidates
for
the
general
assembly
running
in
those
primaries
were
to
file
for
revised
districts
within
two
weeks
after
the
court
handed
down
its
plan.
and
it
seems
perfectly
clear
that
the
lower
court
could
not
as
a
practical
matter,
have
given
guidelines
to
the
assembly,
sent
the
matter
back
to
the
assembly,
received
back
whatever
plan
they
developed,
reviewed
it,
modified
it,
held
hearings,
ordered
in
to
effect
without
great
disruption
to
virginia’s
elective
procedures.
for
example,
it
would
have
obviously
compressed
to
the
very
end
the
filing
dates
for
candidates.
the
primary
would
certainly
–
probably
had
to
been
postponed
for
the
second
time
from
september
14.
campaigns
would
have
been
compressed
and
perhaps
the
general
election
would
have
to
been
postponed.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
what
the
lower
court
did
was
entirely
proper
in
accordance
with
the
holding
and
opinion
in
reynolds
versus
sims
where
the
court
stated
that
lower
courts
would
have
a
wide
latitude
in
developing
“remedial
techniques”
and
that
these
techniques
“will
probably
often
differed
depending
on
local
conditions.”
the
court
there
further
stated
and
i
think
it’s
particularly
pertinent
to
this
case
that
in
a
warning
or
withholding
immediate
relief
the
court
is
entitled
to
and
should
consider
the
proximity
of
a
forthcoming
election
and
the
mechanics
and
complexities
of
state
election
laws
and
should
act
and
rely
up
on
general
equitable
principles.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
beans,
the
discretion
of
reapportioning
court
is
not
unlimited
but
it
is
certainly
broad.
i
can
tell
that
the
court
proceeded
properly
and
in
accordance
with
equitable
principles.
first
of
all
and
most
important
to
us
it
abolished
the
discrimination
we
complained
of,
and
gave
us
the
additional
delegate
we
are
entitled
to.
also
acting
reasonable,
i
believe,
because
it
took
the
assembly’s
house
of
delegate
plan
and
simply
modified
it
as
necessary
to
reduce
the
population
deviations
by
about
one
half,
the
result
being
that
the
court’s
plan
in
virginia,
we
have
134
counties
and
cities.
the
courts
plan
found
it
necessary
to
cross
boundary
lines
in
the
case
of
only
12
of
these
counties
and
cities.
so,
i
believe
and
submit
to
you
that
the
court’s
plan
was
entirely
reasonable
and
proper.
and
finally,
your
honors,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
submit
that
it’s
unnecessary
for
the
supreme
court
to
further
consider
this
case
at
this
stage.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
remind
you
that
the
appeal
here
is
from
an
interlocutory
order
below.
also,
the
virginia
general
assembly
will
meet
next
month
at
a
regular
session
and
under
the
clear
holding
in
connor
versus
williams,
it
could
have
caused
at
that
time
enact
or
reenact
any
reapportionment
legislation
it
saw
fit,
subject
only
of
course
to
proper
constitutional
considerations.
now
if
it
does
so,
at
the
coming
general
assembly,
that
plan
presumably
would
be
referred
back
to
the
lower
court
for
consideration
and
modification
perhaps.
if
then,
further
appeals
are
taken
to
this
court,
the
situation
deemed
desirable
by
the
court
in
connor
versus
williams
will
then
occur.
the
court
will
then
have
it
--
will
then
have
which
it
does
not
now
have
a
final
order
before
it
on
appeal
covering
the
entire
state.
as
i
say,
it
is
only
an
interlocutory
order
that
is
before
you
now.
now,
if
on
the
other
hand
the
general
assembly
and
it
is
much
more
likely
fails
to
enact
a
new
plan
of
reapportionment,
its
continued
inaction
will
demonstrate
very
clearly,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
the
assembly
now
has
no
objection
whatsoever
to
the
district
court’s
plan.
and
this,
as
a
matter
of
practicalities,
i
believe
is
the
actual
situation.
here
are
the
facts;
in
1971,
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
my
good
friend
mr.
miller
was
asked
to
take
this
appeal
by
the
1971
assembly
elected
under
the
old
law.
since
then,
a
new
general
assembly
has
been
elected
and
is
sitting
and
acting
--
acted
at
the
assembly
session
earlier
this
year
and
passed
laws
for
the
government
of
virginia.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
i
think
it
might
well
do
so.
that
is
a
perfectly
good
contingency,
i
believe
and
at
the
past
72
session,
your
honors,
the
house
of
delegates
did
not
even
consider
much
less
enact
as
it
could
have
done
under
connor
versus
williams,
any
new
reapportionment
legislation.
the
clarification
being
that
the
last
thing
the
house
of
delegates,
the
present
house
of
delegates
wants
is
a
reversal
of
the
reapportionment
plan
under
which
they
were
elected.
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
under
the
circumstances
here
present
where
the
legislative
body
elected
and
acting,
under
a
district
court
plan,
a
reversal
of
the
lower
court’s
plan
will
be
confusing
to
the
voters,
difficult
for
candidates
and
certainly
not
my
judgment
in
the
best
interest
the
people
of
virginia.
for
these
reasons,
your
honors,
i
submit
that
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
and
the
counsel
for
virginia
beach
may
will
be
the
only
persons
in
the
commonwealth
who
are
desirous
of
seeing
this
appeal,
their
appeal
succeed.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
no,
your
honor.
in
the
assembly,
during
the
discussion
of
the
plan
there,
we
at
northern
virginia
did
submit
plans
that
we
felt
would
prevent
any
discrimination
against
us,
but
they
were
rejected.
when
we
came
before
the
lower
court,
of
course,
our
principal
interest
was
in
the
northern
virginia
region
and
not
in
the
state
as
whole;
we
therefore,
did
not
propose
the
statewide
plan.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
we
proposed
single-member
districts
in
the
assembly
and
that’s
what
we
desired,
but
we
gave
up
that
contention
after
chavis
versus
whitcomb.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
that
issue
is
not
here.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
in
northern
virginia
--
in
my
case,
we
felt
that
a
division
of
northern
virginia
to
two
districts
of
five
and
six
delegates
was
simply
preferable
to
one
of
11
districts.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
that
issue
is
not
here.
mr.
clive
l.
duval,
ii
those
issues
were
all
dropped
at
the
lower
level.
in
conclusion
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
who
lost
his
bark
on
these
appellate
seats
in
1971
with
a
crew
of
many
supporters
whom
i
might
say
as
you
proceed,
he
is
a
very
fine
attorney
and
a
close
friend
of
mine,
now
finds
himself
in
a
situation
reminiscent
i
say
of
coleridge's
“ancient
mariner
-
alone,
alone,
all
all
alone,
alone
on
a
wide,
wide
sea.”
the
fact
is
that
the
attorney
general’s
1971
crew
has
left
him
and
a
new
crew
is
sitting
back
in
port
in
richmond
hopeful
that
his
vessel,
this
appeal
will
sink
without
trace.
i
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court’s
order
or
alternately
to
dismiss
the
appeals
herein
without
prejudice.
thank
you.
