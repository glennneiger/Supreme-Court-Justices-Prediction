mr.
andrew
p.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
attorney
general
of
commonwealth,
i
am
here
today
representing
its
state
board
of
elections
in
these
cases.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
at
the
outset,
i
sketch
very
briefly
the
factual
background
involved
here
due
to
the
complexities
of
that
background.
under
the
revised
virginia
constitution,
article
ii,
section
6,
reapportionment,
unlike
many
states
was
required
in
1971.
under
schedule
of
that
constitution,
section
5,
the
virginia
general
assembly
was
required
to
convene
in
session
on
january
6,
1971
for
the
purpose
of
reapportionment.
as
a
result,
two
acts
were
adopted
and
the
first,
section
24.1-12.1
establishing
52
districts
for
the
virginia
house
of
delegates.
there
are
hundred
members
of
that
body.
this
plan
consisted
of
single-member
districts,
multi-member
districts
and
floater
districts.
also,
section
24.1-14.1
establishing
40
single-member
districts
for
the
40
member
senate
of
virginia.
as
soon
as
these
acts
were
approved
on
march
1,
1971,
they
were
forwarded
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
there
were
three
suits
bought
and
i’ll
touch
on
them
to
the
extent
that
they
are
relevant
here.
first,
on
march
8,
by
mr.
duval
alleging
a
failure
to
provide
equal
representation
and
also
objecting
to
multi-member
districts
as
such;
by
mr.
perez,
who
is
not
here
today,
alleging
a
failure
to
provide
equal
representation
and
seeking
the
creation
of
a
single
multi-member
district
in
fairfax
county,
rather
than
the
two
multi-member
districts
consisting
of
five
delegates
each,
which
were
created
by
the
general
assembly.
that
case
was
filed
on
march
of
22.
on
the
march
the
2nd,
the
attorney
governor
howell,
who
is
here
with
us
today,
also
filed
a
suit,
again
alleging
failure
of
equal
representation
but
that
suit
was
limited
to
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
seventh
senate
districts.
those
districts
are
located
in
norfolk
and
a
portion
of
virginia
beach.
as
i
said
earlier,
they
are
single-member
districts
and
cut
across
jurisdictional
lines.
in
addition,
the
cities
of
virginia
beach
and
norfolk
intervened.
mr.
frazier
is
here
representing
the
city
of
virginia
beach
this
morning
and
the
city
of
norfolk
is
not
represented
by
counsel
and
there
were
a
group
of
plaintiff
interveners,
taking
the
position
that
multi-member
districts
were
inappropriate
because
of
the
fact
that
they
constituted
a
delusion
of
the
negro
vote.
mr.
howell,
in
his
case,
took
the
opposing
position
that
in
fact,
the
creation
of
single-member
districts
represented
in
the
norfolk-virginia
beach
area,
a
delusion
of
the
negro
vote.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
the
contrast
that
we
have
here
because
it
shows
how
peculiarly
these
considerations
are
ones
which
a
legislature
such
as
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
has
great
difficulty
in
solving.
there
are
different
points
of
view
with
respect
to
multi-member
and
single-member
districts.
now,
the
different
points
of
view
as
to
what
the
effect
to
the
creation
of
these
districts
are.
so
the
general
assembly
was
faced
with
exceedingly
difficult
task.
the
lower
court
found
that
variations
existed
in
their
plans,
which
exceeded
what
the
court
considered
permissible
limits
on
the
basis
of
numbers
only.
as
to
the
house
of
delegates,
the
court
proceeded
to
draw
its
own
plan
rather
than
allowing
the
general
assembly
to
proceed
once
the
constitutional
guidelines
have
been
established
to
the
court
and
the
same
thing
occurred
with
respect
to
the
senate.
the
court's
house
of
district
plan,
house
of
delegates
plan,
fragmented
various
governmental
entities
within
the
commonwealth,
shifted
one
delegate
from
the
tidewater
area
to
northern
virginia,
denied,
mr.
duval’s
prayer
for
single-member
districts
and
denied,
mr.
perez’
prayer
for
a
large
multi-member
district
in
fairfax
county.
the
plan
itself
resulted
in
a
variation
from
norm
of
some
10.27%,
this
is
the
court
plan.
as
for
the
senate,
the
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
districts,
which
i
refer
to,
the
court
found
that
the
population
of
those
districts
were
almost
at
the
norm,
but
because
of
a
housing
sample
relating
to
some
36,000
sailors
who
were
counted
by
the
census
in
norfolk
because
of
the
fact
that
the
ships
they
are
on
are
“home-ported”
at
norfolk.
this
census
showing
that
some
21,000
of
these
individuals
had
addresses
outside
of
the
fifth
senatorial
district
in
which
the
naval
base
is
located,
established
a
multi-membered
district
consisting
of
the
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
senatorial
districts.
in
other
words,
those
districts
were
combined
into
a
single
district
which
of
course,
represented
an
anomaly
as
far
as
the
senate
plan
is
concerned
because
otherwise
it
was
completely
a
single
district
plan
as
desired
by
the
general
assembly.
i
want
to
mention
before
i
proceed
further,
certain
dates
because
i
think
they
will
set
the
background
for
what
i
will
be
addressing
myself
to.
on
may
7,
i
already
mentioned
that
the
plans
were
forwarded
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
the
attorney
general
filed
with
state
objections
under
the
voting
rights
act
in
two
respects.
one,
the
division
line
between
senate
districts
five
and
six
which
i
have
just
referred
to,
and
also
to
the
five
multi-member
districts
in
the
house,
that
objection
being
based
on
the
lower
court
decision
in
the
case
of
chavis
versus
whitcomb.
on
may
the
10th,
the
general
assembly
reconvened,
but
this
court
had
not
decided
the
chavis
case.
the
lower
court
had
not
acted
and
consequently,
the
general
assembly
recessed
to
await
the
chavis
decision
and
to
give
the
time
for
the
court
to
act
with
respect
to
these
suits
which
were
pending
before
it.
on
may
the
24th,
the
court
entered
an
order
on
first
hearing,
which
said
in
essence
that
on
or
before
june
15th,
1971,
virginia
was
to
adopt
and
submit
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
curative
legislation
with
respect
to
the
two
objections
i
have
just
mentioned.
if
that
were
not
done
by
that
date,
then
the
court
would
proceed
the
trial.
on
june
the
3rd,
the
general
assembly
came
back
into
session.
senate
bill
125
was
introduced
to
cure
the
attorney
general's
objections
to
the
senate
plan,
which
constituted
the
drawing
of
a
single
line
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
districts.
and
then,
the
general
assembly
recessed
until
june,
the
7th,
to
await
this
court’s
decision
in
chavis
versus
whitcomb.
on
june
the
7th,
chavis
versus
whitcomb
was
decided.
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
withdrew
his
objections
to
the
house
plan.
the
general
assembly
passed
senate
bill
125,
curing
the
objection
with
respect
to
the
senate
line
in
districts
five
and
six.
consequently,
the
court’s
order,
which
i
refer
to
on
may
24th,
was
fully
complied
with
and
so
the
general
assembly
recessed
until
august
16th,
the
subject
of
course,
to
being
reconvened
earlier
for
the
court
to
decide
the
issues
before
it.
on
june
the
16th,
there
was
such
a
hearing.
on
july
the
2nd,
the
court
in
its
order
found
the
plans
constitutionally
defective,
but
instead
of
permitting
the
general
assembly
to
come
back
into
session
and
to
act
on
the
guidelines
established
in
the
court’s
opinion
as
to
what
in
fact
would
be
a
constitutionally
appropriate,
reapportionment
plan
proceeded
to
mandate
on
itself.
on
july
8th,
the
general
assembly
reconvened,
directed
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
to
appeal
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
adjourn
since
there
was
nothing
further,
which
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
could
do
under
those
circumstances.
thus
today,
we
start
a
second
round
or
second
decade
of
reapportionment
litigation
with
the
hope
that
guidelines
maybe
established
in
order
that
states
throughout
the
country
will
not
be
faced
with
subsequent
rounds
of
litigation
as
to
what
in
fact
is
constitutionally
permitted
in
terms
of
the
drawing
of
legislated
district
lines.
i
want
to
address
myself
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
house
plan
and
then
to
the
senate
plan
and
then
i
will
cease
at
that
point
and
mr.
frazier
will
deliver
his
argument.
with
respect
to
the
house,
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
based
on
numbers
and
numbers
alone
when
it
struck
down
the
validity
of
the
virginia
house
and
delegate's
plan.
the
lower
court
relying
on
this
court’s
previous
decisions
in
kirkpatrick
and
wells,
both
of
course
being
congressional
redistricting
cases,
not
state
legislative
cases,
found
variations
exceeding
those
which
were
struck
down
in
those
two
cases.
now,
if
numbers
must
be
the
sole
criteria
of
the
virginia
plan,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
not
have
looked
only
at
the
maximum
variation
of
plus
9.6%
and
minus
6.8%
depending
on
the
calculations
of
the
floater
district
concept.
it
should
have
considered
that
of
52
house
districts,
35
were
within
4%
of
the
norm,
that
of
52
house
districts,
only
two
exceeded
8%,
that
of
52
house
districts,
the
average
deviation
from
the
norm
was
only
3.8%,
that
of
the
52
house
districts,
a
majority
of
the
delegates
elected
by
or
in
those
districts
would
be
elected
by
49.3%
of
the
population
of
the
state.
but
we
further
submit
that
numbers
and
numbers
alone
viewed
in
the
manner
in
which
the
lower
court
viewed
them
on
the
overall
aspect
as
i
have
just
presented
them
to
you,
cannot
be
what
this
court
meant
in
reynolds
versus
sims
when
it
stated
that
“one
man,
one
vote”
means
an
individual
is
entitled
to
fair
and
effective
representation.
that
is
the
constitutional
criteria
which
we
submit
must
be
met.
it
cannot
be
numerically
measured
alone
for
purposes
of
state
legislative
reapportionment.
but
it
can
be,
we
submit,
measured
by
two-pronged
test.
one,
is
the
apportionment
of
the
house
in
question
based
on
a
permissible
standard.
two,
there
is
the
plan
approached
population
equality
as
closely
as
possible
in
consistency
with
that
rationale.
the
rationale
of
the
virginia
plan
is
very
simple.
it
is
one
suggested
by
this
court
that
a
state
can
accord
political
subdivisions,
some
independent
representation
and
at
least
one
body
of
the
state
legislature,
as
long
as
the
basic
standard
of
equality
of
population
among
districts
is
maintained.
that
was
the
rationale
adopted
in
virginia
and
today
it
is
more
important
than
ever
before
under
the
newly
adopted
virginia
constitution
because
under
this
constitution
which
went
into
effect
in
1971,
counties
of
which
we
have
95
in
the
state
as
well
as
cities
are
given
the
opportunity
to
have
enacted
for
them
numerous
local
or
special
legislation
applicable
to
specific
problems
which
that
jurisdiction
as
a
jurisdiction,
maybe
confronted
with.
now
the
second
test
that
we
suggest
was
also
met.
the
lower
court
specifically
found
that
disparities
in
the
virginia
plan
cannot
be
reduced
at
all
if
the
integrity
of
political
subdivisions
are
mandated.
no
plan
has
been
presented,
which
keeping
intact
local
political
subdivision
boundaries
for
one
house
of
a
bicameral
legislature
achieves
closer
population
equality.
how
then
can
the
lower
court’s
decision
as
to
the
house
plan
be
upheld?
only
in
two
ways,
neither
of
which
were
sustainable
in
this
instance.
first
that
the
court
finds,
that
the
rationale
or
the
virginia
plan,
is
one
that
is
not
permissible
or
is
one
that
was
not
rationally
applied.
according
to
political
subdivisions,
independent
representation
is,
we
submit,
permissible.
the
policy
of
virginia
in
this
regard
was
rationally
applied.
appellant
duval's
argument
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
virginia
constitution
allowing
independent
representation
ignores
a
basic
constitutional
principle
and
that
is
that
a
state
constitution
is
a
document
of
limitation.
nothing
in
virginia’s
constitution
prohibits
according
to
political
subdivisions
independent
representation.
virginia
has
not
abandoned
her
policy,
a
traditional
policy
of
according
political
subdivisions
independent
representation.
she
did
change
this
policy
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned
but
clearly,
in
light
with
this
court’s
language
and
opinion
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
this
does
not
mandate
an
abandonment
of
this
policy
in
the
house
also.
in
fact,
the
design
of
virginia’s
reapportionment
was
to
balance
the
two
houses
of
her
general
assembly
in
this
respect.
the
only
other
manner
in
which
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
can
be
sustained
is
if
this
court
now
decides
that
the
principles
of
congressional
redistricting
are
also
applicable
to
legislative
redistricting.
we
submit,
they
are
none;
for
if
there
were
numbers
and
numbers
alone
which
we're
concerned
with,
there
would
be
no
need
to
determine
whether
various
rationales,
as
suggested
by
this
court
in
previous
opinions
could
be
applied
because
the
only
rationale
would
be
numbers.
there
would
be
no
need
to
determine
whether
one
house
of
a
bicameral
legislature
balances
inequities
in
another
house.
now
for
this
court
to
make
applicable
to
legislative
redistricting,
the
congressional
redistricting
decisions
would
repudiate
its
past
enunciation
that
numbers
and
numbers
alone,
though
most
important,
are
not
the
sole
criteria,
that
a
balancing
concept
of
a
bicameral
legislature
is
constitutionally
acceptable,
and
that
the
maintenance
of
political
subdivisions
is
a
permissible,
a
rationale.
congressional
redistricting,
allocating
representatives
to
congress
is
entirely
different
from
allocating
state
delegates
for
each
state’s
legislative
processes.
the
relationship
of
congressional
districts
to
the
federal
government
simply
cannot
be
compared
with
that
of
legislative
districts
or
to
a
state
government
for
reasons
i
have
previously
assigned.
there
is
one
other
way
in
which
the
court’s
decision
below
may
be
sustained
and
that
is
for
this
court
to
agree
with
everything
that
has
been
stated
here
today,
within
the
state
that
nonetheless
percentage
variation
is
impermissible,
that
the
percentage
is
too
much.
but
for
this
court
to
say
that
would
be
saying
it
on
the
basis
of
numbers
and
numbers
alone.
for
we
have
already
demonstrated
that
virginia
has
applied
a
permissible
rationale
in
a
consisted
manner
and
we
have
come
as
close
to
population
equality
as
possible
in
conformity
with
that
rationale.
the
last
aspect
to
the
lower
court’s
decision,
which
affected
the
house
of
delegates
plan
was
the
removal
of
the
delegate
from
tidewater
area
to
northern
virginia.
this
was
done
essentially
on
the
basis
of
projected
population
growth.
the
virginia
general
assembly
did
not
use
population
projections
and
this
non-use,
we
submit,
is
permissible.
in
any
event,
to
apply
the
population
projections
only
in
one
part
of
the
state
rather
than
utilize
them
consistently
and
rationally
throughout
the
state,
clearly
is
contrary
to
the
ad
hoc
application,
which
this
court
discouraged
in
kirkpatrick.
i
do
not
have
to
stand
here
and
argue
why
the
general
assembly
did
not
use
population
projection.
as
seen
in
the
appendix
at
page
66,
the
projections
on
the
basis
of
fertility
assumptions,
industrial
development,
present
and
planned
highway
and
many
other
considerations,
all
of
which
the
general
assembly
felt
too
speculative
for
proper
utilization.
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned,
there
is
one
simple
issue.
may
apportionment
be
based
on
the
decennial
census
or
must
have
been
based
on
a
sample
housing
survey
conducted
by
a
review
of
zip
codes.
virginia
adopted
two
policies
with
respect
to
the
senate.
the
first
policy
was
that
the
entire
senate
would
consist
of
single-member
districts.
one
does
not
have
to
read
many
cases
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
matter
peculiarly
within
the
expertise
of
various
state
legislatures.
and
the
second
choice
that
virginia
made
was
the
adoption
of
a
total
population
apportionment
base.
obviously,
there
are
various
basis
which
a
state
might
adopt,
but
in
virginia,
the
intent,
as
demonstrated
in
the
debates
of
the
virginia
constitutional
revisions
as
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
8,
was
for
redistricting
to
include
every
human
being
living
and
counted,
balloted
at
decennial
census
of
the
united
states
government.
that
means
that
the
lower
court
was
faced
with
what
we
submit,
were
two
valid
constitutional
policies.
it
ignored
both.
it
found
that
the
apportionment
base
was
not
proper
simply
because
a
sample
zip
code
housing
survey
showed
that
of
the
36,000
sailors
enumerated
aboard
vessels,
approximately
50%
had
addresses
outside
the
fifth
senatorial
district.
if
the
court
had
bothered
to
consistently
apply
this
sample
housing
survey,
it
would
have
seen
that
the
survey
at
least
purported
to
show
that
not
only
that
18,000
had
addresses
outside
the
fifth
senatorial
district,
but
that
approximately
half
of
these
addresses,
in
other
words
9,000
or
9,500
were
outside
of
the
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
senatorial
districts
because
they
lived
in
other
jurisdictions
in
the
hampton
roads
area,
the
cities
of
portsmouth
and
chesapeake,
the
cities
of
newport
news
and
hampton.
and
i
think
it
is
well-settled
that
a
state
has
great
latitude
in
choosing
its
own
apportionment
base
and
i
submit
that
the
base
chosen
by
virginia
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
consequently
should
be
approved
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
may
it
please
the
court.
what
you
have
just
heard
sounds
to
me,
as
if
it’s
an
instant
replay
of
certain
political
arguments
with
which
this
court
should
not
necessarily
be
concerned.
but
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
issue
which
is
before
us
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
draw
your
attention
to
plaintiff’s
exhibit
number
29
because
in
response
to
mr.
rehnquist’s
point,
there
is
a
second
congressional
district
which
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
yes
sir,
which
i
believe
you
have
in
your
right
hand,
a
second
congressional
district
consisting
of
the
city
of
norfolk
and
most
but
not
all
of
virginia
beach.
now,
we
have
three
senate
districts
here,
five,
six
and
seven
which
cover
all
of
norfolk
and
a
portion
of
virginia
beach.
in
other
words,
with
one
more
senate
district,
one
would
have
had
the
congressional
district
which
you
refer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
consequently
your
point
is
very
well
taken.
i
was
amazed
at
mr.
howell’s
suggestion
that
in
fact
there
are
not
a
significant
number
of
people
who
are
enumerated
as
“home-ported”
in
census
tract
999
who
do
not
live
outside
of
the
fifth,
six
and
seventh
senatorial
districts.
the
facts
are
exactly
to
the
contrary.
if
your
honors
would
turn
to
appendix
140,
you
will
see
a
listing
of
zip
codes.
those
zip
codes
show
that
a
significant
number
of
the
individuals
involved
live
in
chesapeake
which
is
the
city
at
the
bottom
of
the
map
here,
live
in
portsmouth
which
is
the
city
just
off
the
map
to
my
left
and
in
hampton
and
newport
news
which
are
in
fact
across
hampton
roads,
the
only
way
you
can
get
there
is
by
crossing
a
bridge
tunnel.
in
terms
of
evidence,
which
relates
to
this
point
i
would
like
to
refer
your
honors
to
appendix
200,
and
read
the
following
colloquy
which
took
place
in
the
deposition.
this
is
mr.
reed’s
deposition
which
is
take
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
yes
sir,
it's
in
--
yes
sir,
it’s
part
of
the
record
in
the
case
and
is
in
appendix
on
page
200,
the
portion
i
am
reading
sir.
now,
we
have
testified
and
also
supplied
an
affidavit
that
59%
of
the
36,693
or
approximately
21,600
do
not
live
in
the
fifth
senatorial
district.
is
that
correct?
that’s
correct.
and
then
going
down,
have
you
got
it
answer,
5,050
in
senate
district
six,
7100
in
the
norfolk
portion
of
district
seven
and
9500
live
outside
the
city
limits
of
norfolk.
they
live
in
virginia
beach
and
some
live
in
chesapeake,
right.
and
some
live
in
portsmouth,
right.
and
some
live
in
newport
news,
right
and
some
live
in
hampton
and
then
there
is
colloquy,
in
the
end,
he
admits
that
some
in
fact
do
live
in
hampton
as
shown
by
the
zip
codes,
set
forth
on
appendix
140.
so,
i
think
that
lays
that
particular
issue
to
rest.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
we
did
know
sir,
we
don't.
we
do
know
that
clearly
significant
number.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
right,
well
your
honor
no
part
of
the
city
of
chesapeake
is
in
five,
six
or
seven,
no
part
of
the
city
of
portsmouth
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
and
hampton
and
newport
news.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
yes
sir.
well,
he
suggested
that
9,500
lived
out
of
the
boundaries
of
the
city
of
norfolk,
so
as
far
--
the
only
portion
of
senate
districts
five,
six
and
seven
which
the
district
court
consolidated,
outside
the
city
of
norfolk
40,000
out
of
a
170,000
total
population
of
virginia
beach.
so
i
would
readily
concede
your
honor
there
maybe
1,000-2,000
of
the
9,500
may
live
in
the
40,000
which
are
part
of
virginia
beach
and
then
put
in
with
norfolk
but
clearly
you
are
talking
about
a
very
significant
number
40%
on
the
basis
of
the
zip
codes
at
the
minimum
which
live
in
other
cities
and
outside
the
senatorial
districts
in
question.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
no
sir.
i
don’t
think
it
could
be
done
as
a
practical
matter
and
if
i
may
address
myself
to
that
for
just
a
moment.
i
submit
that
the
only
way
which
the
lower
court’s
decision
can
be
upheld
is
for
this
court
to
determine
that
it
was
arbitrary
for
the
commonwealth
to
utilize
the
census.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
your
honor,
i
was
getting
to
that
and
the
point
is
that
one
would
simply
open
up
pandora’s
box,
if
one
took
that
out
and
let
me
explain
why
because
one
is
not
only
talking
about
naval
personnel
here.
we
are
talking
about
all
members
of
the
military.
we
are
talking
about
college
students,
we
are
talking
about
inmates
of
mental
institutions
and
penitentiaries,
individuals
who
work
in
one
location
or
live
there
during
the
week
and
go
elsewhere
for
the
weekend.
consequently,
what
mr.
howell
was
suggesting
in
this
case
that
one
goes
completely
behind
the
census,
and
one
will
have
constant
litigation
as
to
where
in
fact
the
individuals
in
the
categories
i
just
mentioned
and
that
list
is
not
exclusive
should
in
fact
be
located.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
let
me
conclude
by
saying,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
observation,
that
we
are
faced
here
with
a
rational
plan,
unlike
the
situation
in
swann
that
there
was
a
balancing
in
northern
virginia
between
the
house
of
delegates
and
the
senate.
one
being
over
represented,
the
other
being
under
represented
and
that
the
general
assembly
will
again
be
in
session
in
january.
if
the
court
finds
that
there
is
any
constitutional
defect
in
the
plan
it
adopted,
it
would
be
in
a
position
to
act
in
that
session
in
accordance
to
whatever
guidelines
this
court
lays
down.
however,
i
urge
the
court
to
sustain
the
plan,
as
adopted
by
the
general
assembly,
as
being
fully
in
accord
with
the
guidelines
handed
down
by
this
court
in
its
decision
in
reynolds
versus
sims.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
attorney
general
of
commonwealth,
i
am
here
today
representing
its
state
board
of
elections
in
these
cases.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
at
the
outset,
i
sketch
very
briefly
the
factual
background
involved
here
due
to
the
complexities
of
that
background.
under
the
revised
virginia
constitution,
article
ii,
section
6,
reapportionment,
unlike
many
states
was
required
in
1971.
under
schedule
of
that
constitution,
section
5,
the
virginia
general
assembly
was
required
to
convene
in
session
on
january
6,
1971
for
the
purpose
of
reapportionment.
as
a
result,
two
acts
were
adopted
and
the
first,
section
24.1-12.1
establishing
52
districts
for
the
virginia
house
of
delegates.
there
are
hundred
members
of
that
body.
this
plan
consisted
of
single-member
districts,
multi-member
districts
and
floater
districts.
also,
section
24.1-14.1
establishing
40
single-member
districts
for
the
40
member
senate
of
virginia.
as
soon
as
these
acts
were
approved
on
march
1,
1971,
they
were
forwarded
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
there
were
three
suits
bought
and
i’ll
touch
on
them
to
the
extent
that
they
are
relevant
here.
first,
on
march
8,
by
mr.
duval
alleging
a
failure
to
provide
equal
representation
and
also
objecting
to
multi-member
districts
as
such;
by
mr.
perez,
who
is
not
here
today,
alleging
a
failure
to
provide
equal
representation
and
seeking
the
creation
of
a
single
multi-member
district
in
fairfax
county,
rather
than
the
two
multi-member
districts
consisting
of
five
delegates
each,
which
were
created
by
the
general
assembly.
that
case
was
filed
on
march
of
22.
on
the
march
the
2nd,
the
attorney
governor
howell,
who
is
here
with
us
today,
also
filed
a
suit,
again
alleging
failure
of
equal
representation
but
that
suit
was
limited
to
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
seventh
senate
districts.
those
districts
are
located
in
norfolk
and
a
portion
of
virginia
beach.
as
i
said
earlier,
they
are
single-member
districts
and
cut
across
jurisdictional
lines.
in
addition,
the
cities
of
virginia
beach
and
norfolk
intervened.
mr.
frazier
is
here
representing
the
city
of
virginia
beach
this
morning
and
the
city
of
norfolk
is
not
represented
by
counsel
and
there
were
a
group
of
plaintiff
interveners,
taking
the
position
that
multi-member
districts
were
inappropriate
because
of
the
fact
that
they
constituted
a
delusion
of
the
negro
vote.
mr.
howell,
in
his
case,
took
the
opposing
position
that
in
fact,
the
creation
of
single-member
districts
represented
in
the
norfolk-virginia
beach
area,
a
delusion
of
the
negro
vote.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
the
contrast
that
we
have
here
because
it
shows
how
peculiarly
these
considerations
are
ones
which
a
legislature
such
as
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
has
great
difficulty
in
solving.
there
are
different
points
of
view
with
respect
to
multi-member
and
single-member
districts.
now,
the
different
points
of
view
as
to
what
the
effect
to
the
creation
of
these
districts
are.
so
the
general
assembly
was
faced
with
exceedingly
difficult
task.
the
lower
court
found
that
variations
existed
in
their
plans,
which
exceeded
what
the
court
considered
permissible
limits
on
the
basis
of
numbers
only.
as
to
the
house
of
delegates,
the
court
proceeded
to
draw
its
own
plan
rather
than
allowing
the
general
assembly
to
proceed
once
the
constitutional
guidelines
have
been
established
to
the
court
and
the
same
thing
occurred
with
respect
to
the
senate.
the
court's
house
of
district
plan,
house
of
delegates
plan,
fragmented
various
governmental
entities
within
the
commonwealth,
shifted
one
delegate
from
the
tidewater
area
to
northern
virginia,
denied,
mr.
duval’s
prayer
for
single-member
districts
and
denied,
mr.
perez’
prayer
for
a
large
multi-member
district
in
fairfax
county.
the
plan
itself
resulted
in
a
variation
from
norm
of
some
10.27%,
this
is
the
court
plan.
as
for
the
senate,
the
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
districts,
which
i
refer
to,
the
court
found
that
the
population
of
those
districts
were
almost
at
the
norm,
but
because
of
a
housing
sample
relating
to
some
36,000
sailors
who
were
counted
by
the
census
in
norfolk
because
of
the
fact
that
the
ships
they
are
on
are
“home-ported”
at
norfolk.
this
census
showing
that
some
21,000
of
these
individuals
had
addresses
outside
of
the
fifth
senatorial
district
in
which
the
naval
base
is
located,
established
a
multi-membered
district
consisting
of
the
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
senatorial
districts.
in
other
words,
those
districts
were
combined
into
a
single
district
which
of
course,
represented
an
anomaly
as
far
as
the
senate
plan
is
concerned
because
otherwise
it
was
completely
a
single
district
plan
as
desired
by
the
general
assembly.
i
want
to
mention
before
i
proceed
further,
certain
dates
because
i
think
they
will
set
the
background
for
what
i
will
be
addressing
myself
to.
on
may
7,
i
already
mentioned
that
the
plans
were
forwarded
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
the
attorney
general
filed
with
state
objections
under
the
voting
rights
act
in
two
respects.
one,
the
division
line
between
senate
districts
five
and
six
which
i
have
just
referred
to,
and
also
to
the
five
multi-member
districts
in
the
house,
that
objection
being
based
on
the
lower
court
decision
in
the
case
of
chavis
versus
whitcomb.
on
may
the
10th,
the
general
assembly
reconvened,
but
this
court
had
not
decided
the
chavis
case.
the
lower
court
had
not
acted
and
consequently,
the
general
assembly
recessed
to
await
the
chavis
decision
and
to
give
the
time
for
the
court
to
act
with
respect
to
these
suits
which
were
pending
before
it.
on
may
the
24th,
the
court
entered
an
order
on
first
hearing,
which
said
in
essence
that
on
or
before
june
15th,
1971,
virginia
was
to
adopt
and
submit
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
curative
legislation
with
respect
to
the
two
objections
i
have
just
mentioned.
if
that
were
not
done
by
that
date,
then
the
court
would
proceed
the
trial.
on
june
the
3rd,
the
general
assembly
came
back
into
session.
senate
bill
125
was
introduced
to
cure
the
attorney
general's
objections
to
the
senate
plan,
which
constituted
the
drawing
of
a
single
line
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
districts.
and
then,
the
general
assembly
recessed
until
june,
the
7th,
to
await
this
court’s
decision
in
chavis
versus
whitcomb.
on
june
the
7th,
chavis
versus
whitcomb
was
decided.
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
withdrew
his
objections
to
the
house
plan.
the
general
assembly
passed
senate
bill
125,
curing
the
objection
with
respect
to
the
senate
line
in
districts
five
and
six.
consequently,
the
court’s
order,
which
i
refer
to
on
may
24th,
was
fully
complied
with
and
so
the
general
assembly
recessed
until
august
16th,
the
subject
of
course,
to
being
reconvened
earlier
for
the
court
to
decide
the
issues
before
it.
on
june
the
16th,
there
was
such
a
hearing.
on
july
the
2nd,
the
court
in
its
order
found
the
plans
constitutionally
defective,
but
instead
of
permitting
the
general
assembly
to
come
back
into
session
and
to
act
on
the
guidelines
established
in
the
court’s
opinion
as
to
what
in
fact
would
be
a
constitutionally
appropriate,
reapportionment
plan
proceeded
to
mandate
on
itself.
on
july
8th,
the
general
assembly
reconvened,
directed
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
to
appeal
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
adjourn
since
there
was
nothing
further,
which
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
could
do
under
those
circumstances.
thus
today,
we
start
a
second
round
or
second
decade
of
reapportionment
litigation
with
the
hope
that
guidelines
maybe
established
in
order
that
states
throughout
the
country
will
not
be
faced
with
subsequent
rounds
of
litigation
as
to
what
in
fact
is
constitutionally
permitted
in
terms
of
the
drawing
of
legislated
district
lines.
i
want
to
address
myself
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
house
plan
and
then
to
the
senate
plan
and
then
i
will
cease
at
that
point
and
mr.
frazier
will
deliver
his
argument.
with
respect
to
the
house,
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
based
on
numbers
and
numbers
alone
when
it
struck
down
the
validity
of
the
virginia
house
and
delegate's
plan.
the
lower
court
relying
on
this
court’s
previous
decisions
in
kirkpatrick
and
wells,
both
of
course
being
congressional
redistricting
cases,
not
state
legislative
cases,
found
variations
exceeding
those
which
were
struck
down
in
those
two
cases.
now,
if
numbers
must
be
the
sole
criteria
of
the
virginia
plan,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
not
have
looked
only
at
the
maximum
variation
of
plus
9.6%
and
minus
6.8%
depending
on
the
calculations
of
the
floater
district
concept.
it
should
have
considered
that
of
52
house
districts,
35
were
within
4%
of
the
norm,
that
of
52
house
districts,
only
two
exceeded
8%,
that
of
52
house
districts,
the
average
deviation
from
the
norm
was
only
3.8%,
that
of
the
52
house
districts,
a
majority
of
the
delegates
elected
by
or
in
those
districts
would
be
elected
by
49.3%
of
the
population
of
the
state.
but
we
further
submit
that
numbers
and
numbers
alone
viewed
in
the
manner
in
which
the
lower
court
viewed
them
on
the
overall
aspect
as
i
have
just
presented
them
to
you,
cannot
be
what
this
court
meant
in
reynolds
versus
sims
when
it
stated
that
“one
man,
one
vote”
means
an
individual
is
entitled
to
fair
and
effective
representation.
that
is
the
constitutional
criteria
which
we
submit
must
be
met.
it
cannot
be
numerically
measured
alone
for
purposes
of
state
legislative
reapportionment.
but
it
can
be,
we
submit,
measured
by
two-pronged
test.
one,
is
the
apportionment
of
the
house
in
question
based
on
a
permissible
standard.
two,
there
is
the
plan
approached
population
equality
as
closely
as
possible
in
consistency
with
that
rationale.
the
rationale
of
the
virginia
plan
is
very
simple.
it
is
one
suggested
by
this
court
that
a
state
can
accord
political
subdivisions,
some
independent
representation
and
at
least
one
body
of
the
state
legislature,
as
long
as
the
basic
standard
of
equality
of
population
among
districts
is
maintained.
that
was
the
rationale
adopted
in
virginia
and
today
it
is
more
important
than
ever
before
under
the
newly
adopted
virginia
constitution
because
under
this
constitution
which
went
into
effect
in
1971,
counties
of
which
we
have
95
in
the
state
as
well
as
cities
are
given
the
opportunity
to
have
enacted
for
them
numerous
local
or
special
legislation
applicable
to
specific
problems
which
that
jurisdiction
as
a
jurisdiction,
maybe
confronted
with.
now
the
second
test
that
we
suggest
was
also
met.
the
lower
court
specifically
found
that
disparities
in
the
virginia
plan
cannot
be
reduced
at
all
if
the
integrity
of
political
subdivisions
are
mandated.
no
plan
has
been
presented,
which
keeping
intact
local
political
subdivision
boundaries
for
one
house
of
a
bicameral
legislature
achieves
closer
population
equality.
how
then
can
the
lower
court’s
decision
as
to
the
house
plan
be
upheld?
only
in
two
ways,
neither
of
which
were
sustainable
in
this
instance.
first
that
the
court
finds,
that
the
rationale
or
the
virginia
plan,
is
one
that
is
not
permissible
or
is
one
that
was
not
rationally
applied.
according
to
political
subdivisions,
independent
representation
is,
we
submit,
permissible.
the
policy
of
virginia
in
this
regard
was
rationally
applied.
appellant
duval's
argument
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
virginia
constitution
allowing
independent
representation
ignores
a
basic
constitutional
principle
and
that
is
that
a
state
constitution
is
a
document
of
limitation.
nothing
in
virginia’s
constitution
prohibits
according
to
political
subdivisions
independent
representation.
virginia
has
not
abandoned
her
policy,
a
traditional
policy
of
according
political
subdivisions
independent
representation.
she
did
change
this
policy
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned
but
clearly,
in
light
with
this
court’s
language
and
opinion
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
this
does
not
mandate
an
abandonment
of
this
policy
in
the
house
also.
in
fact,
the
design
of
virginia’s
reapportionment
was
to
balance
the
two
houses
of
her
general
assembly
in
this
respect.
the
only
other
manner
in
which
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
can
be
sustained
is
if
this
court
now
decides
that
the
principles
of
congressional
redistricting
are
also
applicable
to
legislative
redistricting.
we
submit,
they
are
none;
for
if
there
were
numbers
and
numbers
alone
which
we're
concerned
with,
there
would
be
no
need
to
determine
whether
various
rationales,
as
suggested
by
this
court
in
previous
opinions
could
be
applied
because
the
only
rationale
would
be
numbers.
there
would
be
no
need
to
determine
whether
one
house
of
a
bicameral
legislature
balances
inequities
in
another
house.
now
for
this
court
to
make
applicable
to
legislative
redistricting,
the
congressional
redistricting
decisions
would
repudiate
its
past
enunciation
that
numbers
and
numbers
alone,
though
most
important,
are
not
the
sole
criteria,
that
a
balancing
concept
of
a
bicameral
legislature
is
constitutionally
acceptable,
and
that
the
maintenance
of
political
subdivisions
is
a
permissible,
a
rationale.
congressional
redistricting,
allocating
representatives
to
congress
is
entirely
different
from
allocating
state
delegates
for
each
state’s
legislative
processes.
the
relationship
of
congressional
districts
to
the
federal
government
simply
cannot
be
compared
with
that
of
legislative
districts
or
to
a
state
government
for
reasons
i
have
previously
assigned.
there
is
one
other
way
in
which
the
court’s
decision
below
may
be
sustained
and
that
is
for
this
court
to
agree
with
everything
that
has
been
stated
here
today,
within
the
state
that
nonetheless
percentage
variation
is
impermissible,
that
the
percentage
is
too
much.
but
for
this
court
to
say
that
would
be
saying
it
on
the
basis
of
numbers
and
numbers
alone.
for
we
have
already
demonstrated
that
virginia
has
applied
a
permissible
rationale
in
a
consisted
manner
and
we
have
come
as
close
to
population
equality
as
possible
in
conformity
with
that
rationale.
the
last
aspect
to
the
lower
court’s
decision,
which
affected
the
house
of
delegates
plan
was
the
removal
of
the
delegate
from
tidewater
area
to
northern
virginia.
this
was
done
essentially
on
the
basis
of
projected
population
growth.
the
virginia
general
assembly
did
not
use
population
projections
and
this
non-use,
we
submit,
is
permissible.
in
any
event,
to
apply
the
population
projections
only
in
one
part
of
the
state
rather
than
utilize
them
consistently
and
rationally
throughout
the
state,
clearly
is
contrary
to
the
ad
hoc
application,
which
this
court
discouraged
in
kirkpatrick.
i
do
not
have
to
stand
here
and
argue
why
the
general
assembly
did
not
use
population
projection.
as
seen
in
the
appendix
at
page
66,
the
projections
on
the
basis
of
fertility
assumptions,
industrial
development,
present
and
planned
highway
and
many
other
considerations,
all
of
which
the
general
assembly
felt
too
speculative
for
proper
utilization.
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned,
there
is
one
simple
issue.
may
apportionment
be
based
on
the
decennial
census
or
must
have
been
based
on
a
sample
housing
survey
conducted
by
a
review
of
zip
codes.
virginia
adopted
two
policies
with
respect
to
the
senate.
the
first
policy
was
that
the
entire
senate
would
consist
of
single-member
districts.
one
does
not
have
to
read
many
cases
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
matter
peculiarly
within
the
expertise
of
various
state
legislatures.
and
the
second
choice
that
virginia
made
was
the
adoption
of
a
total
population
apportionment
base.
obviously,
there
are
various
basis
which
a
state
might
adopt,
but
in
virginia,
the
intent,
as
demonstrated
in
the
debates
of
the
virginia
constitutional
revisions
as
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
8,
was
for
redistricting
to
include
every
human
being
living
and
counted,
balloted
at
decennial
census
of
the
united
states
government.
that
means
that
the
lower
court
was
faced
with
what
we
submit,
were
two
valid
constitutional
policies.
it
ignored
both.
it
found
that
the
apportionment
base
was
not
proper
simply
because
a
sample
zip
code
housing
survey
showed
that
of
the
36,000
sailors
enumerated
aboard
vessels,
approximately
50%
had
addresses
outside
the
fifth
senatorial
district.
if
the
court
had
bothered
to
consistently
apply
this
sample
housing
survey,
it
would
have
seen
that
the
survey
at
least
purported
to
show
that
not
only
that
18,000
had
addresses
outside
the
fifth
senatorial
district,
but
that
approximately
half
of
these
addresses,
in
other
words
9,000
or
9,500
were
outside
of
the
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
senatorial
districts
because
they
lived
in
other
jurisdictions
in
the
hampton
roads
area,
the
cities
of
portsmouth
and
chesapeake,
the
cities
of
newport
news
and
hampton.
and
i
think
it
is
well-settled
that
a
state
has
great
latitude
in
choosing
its
own
apportionment
base
and
i
submit
that
the
base
chosen
by
virginia
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
consequently
should
be
approved
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
may
it
please
the
court.
what
you
have
just
heard
sounds
to
me,
as
if
it’s
an
instant
replay
of
certain
political
arguments
with
which
this
court
should
not
necessarily
be
concerned.
but
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
issue
which
is
before
us
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
draw
your
attention
to
plaintiff’s
exhibit
number
29
because
in
response
to
mr.
rehnquist’s
point,
there
is
a
second
congressional
district
which
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
yes
sir,
which
i
believe
you
have
in
your
right
hand,
a
second
congressional
district
consisting
of
the
city
of
norfolk
and
most
but
not
all
of
virginia
beach.
now,
we
have
three
senate
districts
here,
five,
six
and
seven
which
cover
all
of
norfolk
and
a
portion
of
virginia
beach.
in
other
words,
with
one
more
senate
district,
one
would
have
had
the
congressional
district
which
you
refer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
consequently
your
point
is
very
well
taken.
i
was
amazed
at
mr.
howell’s
suggestion
that
in
fact
there
are
not
a
significant
number
of
people
who
are
enumerated
as
“home-ported”
in
census
tract
999
who
do
not
live
outside
of
the
fifth,
six
and
seventh
senatorial
districts.
the
facts
are
exactly
to
the
contrary.
if
your
honors
would
turn
to
appendix
140,
you
will
see
a
listing
of
zip
codes.
those
zip
codes
show
that
a
significant
number
of
the
individuals
involved
live
in
chesapeake
which
is
the
city
at
the
bottom
of
the
map
here,
live
in
portsmouth
which
is
the
city
just
off
the
map
to
my
left
and
in
hampton
and
newport
news
which
are
in
fact
across
hampton
roads,
the
only
way
you
can
get
there
is
by
crossing
a
bridge
tunnel.
in
terms
of
evidence,
which
relates
to
this
point
i
would
like
to
refer
your
honors
to
appendix
200,
and
read
the
following
colloquy
which
took
place
in
the
deposition.
this
is
mr.
reed’s
deposition
which
is
take
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
yes
sir,
it's
in
--
yes
sir,
it’s
part
of
the
record
in
the
case
and
is
in
appendix
on
page
200,
the
portion
i
am
reading
sir.
now,
we
have
testified
and
also
supplied
an
affidavit
that
59%
of
the
36,693
or
approximately
21,600
do
not
live
in
the
fifth
senatorial
district.
is
that
correct?
that’s
correct.
and
then
going
down,
have
you
got
it
answer,
5,050
in
senate
district
six,
7100
in
the
norfolk
portion
of
district
seven
and
9500
live
outside
the
city
limits
of
norfolk.
they
live
in
virginia
beach
and
some
live
in
chesapeake,
right.
and
some
live
in
portsmouth,
right.
and
some
live
in
newport
news,
right
and
some
live
in
hampton
and
then
there
is
colloquy,
in
the
end,
he
admits
that
some
in
fact
do
live
in
hampton
as
shown
by
the
zip
codes,
set
forth
on
appendix
140.
so,
i
think
that
lays
that
particular
issue
to
rest.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
we
did
know
sir,
we
don't.
we
do
know
that
clearly
significant
number.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
right,
well
your
honor
no
part
of
the
city
of
chesapeake
is
in
five,
six
or
seven,
no
part
of
the
city
of
portsmouth
--
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
and
hampton
and
newport
news.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
yes
sir.
well,
he
suggested
that
9,500
lived
out
of
the
boundaries
of
the
city
of
norfolk,
so
as
far
--
the
only
portion
of
senate
districts
five,
six
and
seven
which
the
district
court
consolidated,
outside
the
city
of
norfolk
40,000
out
of
a
170,000
total
population
of
virginia
beach.
so
i
would
readily
concede
your
honor
there
maybe
1,000-2,000
of
the
9,500
may
live
in
the
40,000
which
are
part
of
virginia
beach
and
then
put
in
with
norfolk
but
clearly
you
are
talking
about
a
very
significant
number
40%
on
the
basis
of
the
zip
codes
at
the
minimum
which
live
in
other
cities
and
outside
the
senatorial
districts
in
question.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
no
sir.
i
don’t
think
it
could
be
done
as
a
practical
matter
and
if
i
may
address
myself
to
that
for
just
a
moment.
i
submit
that
the
only
way
which
the
lower
court’s
decision
can
be
upheld
is
for
this
court
to
determine
that
it
was
arbitrary
for
the
commonwealth
to
utilize
the
census.
mr.
andrew
p.
miller
your
honor,
i
was
getting
to
that
and
the
point
is
that
one
would
simply
open
up
pandora’s
box,
if
one
took
that
out
and
let
me
explain
why
because
one
is
not
only
talking
about
naval
personnel
here.
we
are
talking
about
all
members
of
the
military.
we
are
talking
about
college
students,
we
are
talking
about
inmates
of
mental
institutions
and
penitentiaries,
individuals
who
work
in
one
location
or
live
there
during
the
week
and
go
elsewhere
for
the
weekend.
consequently,
what
mr.
howell
was
suggesting
in
this
case
that
one
goes
completely
behind
the
census,
and
one
will
have
constant
litigation
as
to
where
in
fact
the
individuals
in
the
categories
i
just
mentioned
and
that
list
is
not
exclusive
should
in
fact
be
located.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
let
me
conclude
by
saying,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
observation,
that
we
are
faced
here
with
a
rational
plan,
unlike
the
situation
in
swann
that
there
was
a
balancing
in
northern
virginia
between
the
house
of
delegates
and
the
senate.
one
being
over
represented,
the
other
being
under
represented
and
that
the
general
assembly
will
again
be
in
session
in
january.
if
the
court
finds
that
there
is
any
constitutional
defect
in
the
plan
it
adopted,
it
would
be
in
a
position
to
act
in
that
session
in
accordance
to
whatever
guidelines
this
court
lays
down.
however,
i
urge
the
court
to
sustain
the
plan,
as
adopted
by
the
general
assembly,
as
being
fully
in
accord
with
the
guidelines
handed
down
by
this
court
in
its
decision
in
reynolds
versus
sims.
thank
you
very
much.
