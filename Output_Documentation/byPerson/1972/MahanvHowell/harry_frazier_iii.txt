mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
city
of
virginia
beach
stands
shoulder
by
shoulder
with
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
in
upholding
the
general
assembly’s
house
redistricting
plan
and
in
urging
the
reversal
of
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case.
the
city
of
virginia
beach
is
not
involved
in
the
senate
side
of
the
controversy.
our
position
here
this
morning
is
that
a
state
reapportionment
plan
should
be
judged
not
solely
on
mathematical
comparisons,
but
it
should
be
judged
also
on
the
quality
of
the
representation
that
it
affords
the
people.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
court
cannot
uphold
the
district
court
below,
without
overruling
a
great
deal
of
what
this
court
said
in
reynolds
against
sims.
the
district
court
plan
itself
contains
significant
deviations
from
population
equality
without
any
policy
justification
whatsoever.
the
district
court
said
in
its
opinion
this.
“while
we
have
endeavored
to
reach
a
perfect
mathematical
division,
we
had
been
unable
to
do
so
because
of
the
multiplicity
of
delegates,
the
geography
of
the
state,
and
the
diversity
of
population
concentrations.”
so,
if
you
look
at
numbers
and
that’s
all
the
district
court
did,
its
own
plan
comes
up
with
a
variation
of
10%
but
no
basis
of
that
was
given,
no
effort
was
made
to
justify
that
kind
of
variation
at
all.
as
the
attorney
general
has
pointed
out,
the
greater
variation
in
the
virginia
plan
was
the
result
of
a
rational
basis,
a
desire
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
political
subdivisions
and
to
give
them
an
effective
voice
in
one
house
of
the
general
assembly.
now,
if
the
district
court
was
serious
in
what
it
said
and
was
going
to
abide
by
the
numbers
alone,
it
could
have
done
a
whole
lot
better
job
than
it
did.
so,
without
being
able
to
do
better
than
it
did
and
without
affording
any
basis
whatsoever
for
its
position,
we
think
its
plan
must
fall.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
very
definitely,
we
feel
that
this
court
has
leaned
over
backwards
on
occasion
after
occasion
to
say
that
policy
decision
is
one
for
the
legislature,
not
for
the
district
court
at
all.
and
we
propose
to
emphasize
this
in
several
ways
before
we
are
through
today
but
we
feel
and
one
of
their
arguments
is
that
there
is
a
fundamental
violation
of
due
process
when
the
district
court
arbitrarily
took
the
bit
in
its
teeth
and
said,
this
is
your
plan.
this,
we
think
is
a
second,
but
very
important
phase
of
the
problem
before
the
court
today.
now,
returning
to
the
basic
problem
of
state
reapportionment,
we
think
that
a
fundamental
principle
here
is
that
reynolds
rejects
mathematical
precision
as
a
constitutional
requirement
and
recognizes
the
validity
of
representation
of
political
subdivisions
as
such.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
that
is
our
position--
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
and
as
that
is
brought
down
today
in
kirkpatrick,
the
phrase
as
nearly
as
practicable
appears
whereas
in
reynolds,
construing
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
is
substantial
equality.
and
what
we
are
faced
with
today,
i
believe,
is
the
first
opportunity
the
court
has
had
to
decide
the
question.
what
worry
--
what
right
are
we
headed
in
the
decade
of
the
70’s?
do
they
mean
the
same
thing,
these
phrases,
or
do
they
not?
we,
of
course,
submit
that
they
do
not.
now,
we
find
that
there
is
no
place,
no
valid
place
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
a
representation
of
political
subdivisions
as
such
because
in
congress,
we
are
concerned
with
the
formulation
of
national
policy.
and
the
interest
of
the
states
are
being
represented,
yes,
but
cities,
counties,
we
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
basis
that
we
can
argue
here
for
our
saying
that
they
need
to
be
separately
heard.
and
i
think
this
is
evidenced
by
the
historical
fact
that
for
the
first
50
years
of
our
country,
you
had
at
large
representations
in
many
congressional
districts.
but
there
is
a
place
in
the
states
for
this
type
of
representation
and
we
think
this
court
specifically
so
stated
in
reynolds.
local
government
entities
are
frequently
charged
with
various
responsibilities
incident
to
the
operation
of
state
government.
in
many
states,
much
of
the
legislature’s
activity
involves
the
enactment
of
so-called
local
legislation
directed
only
to
the
concerns
of
political
subdivisions.
we
see
no
reason
why
that
is
not
as
valid
today
as
it
was
in
1964
and
when
we
look
at
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
session
of
its
general
assembly,
most
recently
held,
a
104
of
a
133
local
bills
were
introduced
in
the
house
of
delegates.
this
is
where
the
localities
find
their
primary
voice
and
their
primary
source
of
representation.
so,
that
we
think,
has
a
rational
basis
to
support
it.
we
feel
that
there
are
numbers
of
phrases,
points,
in
the
reynolds
decision
that
must
be
overlooked,
swept
out
under
the
rug
if
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
is
to
be
upheld.
now,
what
is
the
result
of
affirming
that
decision
of
the
lower
court?
first,
reapportionment
will
then
be
reduced
to
a
mathematical
exercise.
if
this
court
is
to
say
today,
kirkpatrick
governs
congressional
and
state
reapportionment
then
all
we
got
to
do
is
become
a
slave
to
numbers
maybe
even
to
computers
and
little
judgment
will
be
exercised.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
policy
decisions
were
no
longer
be
permitted
in
how
you
structure
at
least
one
house
of
the
legislature,
either
house
of
the
legislature,
you
do
it
by
the
numbers.
then
we
would
be
concerned
only
with
the
extremes
of
the
variations
in
the
numbers
and
that’s
what
the
district
court
did
here.
it
took
the
most
over-represented,
the
most
under-represented,
and
added
up
the
percentages
and
said,
that’s
bad,
we
can’t
have
it.
you
do
it
our
way
and
this
is
our
plan,
but
what
happens
here,
you
have
no
quality
of
representation.
no
consideration
of
who
the
people
in
a
given
jurisdiction
can
vote
for.
political
subdivisions
will
be
largely
ignored
as
such,
this
mix
of
rendering
obsolete
bicameral
legislatures.
what
will
be
the
difference
between
the
senate
and
the
house
of
delegates
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
or
any
other
of
the
states?
the
differences
would
merely
be
how
long
the
members
are
elected
for
and
how
many
people
they
represent;
the
size
of
the
districts.
the
only
validity
that
i
can
see
for
affirming
the
district
court
would
be
to
achieve
the
uniformity
in
congressional
and
state
reapportionment
mechanics,
possibly
this
would
cut
down
on
the
amount
of
litigation.
i
am
not
a
bit
sure
that
it
would
but
what
is
the
prize
that
you
pay
for
doing
this.
we
think
there
is
a
loss
of
quality
in
representation.
we
think
the
fallacy
of
the
district
court
numbers
game
is
demonstrated
very
clearly
in
the
case
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
what
happened
at
virginia
beach?
the
general
assembly’s
plan
there
was
not
perfect.
according
to
mr.
duval’s
theory
of
valuing
floater
delegates,
virginia
beach
was
represented
--
under
represented
by
7.3%.
the
district
court
reduced
that
under
representation
to
approximately
2.5%,
but
it
took
29,000
virginia
beach
citizens,
put
them
over
into
norfolk’s
multimember
district,
where
they
now
vote
with
307,000
people
in
a
seven-member
district.
so,
what
has
happened
to
the
quality
of
the
representation
for
those
29,000
people?
they’re
not
a
part
of
virginia
beach.
they
must
vote
for
norfolk
and
how
will
the
delegates
in
the
general
assembly
from
norfolk
feel
if
a
matter
comes
before
the
general
assembly
that
pits
norfolk,
the
interest
of
norfolk
against
that
of
virginia
beach.
obviously,
they’re
not
going
to
go
with
the
29,000;
they’re
going
to
go
with
the
307,000.
the
district
court
has
sacrificed
the
community
interest
of
virginia
beach.
now,
this
is
done
too
in
the
senate
because
40,000
members
of
the
senate,
in
the
senate
--
40,000
of
virginia
beach
people
in
the
senate
district
are
combined
with
75,000
norfolk
citizens
in
a
multimember
district.
i
am
sorry
what
was
started
off
as
a
single-member
district,
it
is
now
a
multimember
district;
40,000
virginia
beach
citizens
and
307,000
norfolk
citizens,
the
same
sort
of
thing.
now,
we
could
live
with
this
in
the
senate.
we
find
it
hard
to
live
with,
in
both
houses
where
the
discrimination
against
virginia
beach
is
so
pointed.
one
right
to
have
solved
this,
if
the
court
is
the
final
arbiter
of
these
political
decisions,
was
not
to
take
29,000
from
virginia
beach
and
put
them
over
in
norfolk’s
multimember
district.
it
would
have
been
to
move
one
seat
to
virginia
beach
and
take
13,000
norfolkians
and
put
them
into
the
virginia
beach,
saying,
to
reverse
the
flow,
if
you
will,
to
balance
some
equities
but
the
court
didn’t
do
that.
this
comes
back
to
a
question
of
remedies,
to
a
question
of
policy
on
which
the
city
of
virginia
beach
had
no
say.
but
coming
back
to
the
subject
of
community
interest
to
making
effective
representation
in
the
general
assembly
for
political
subdivisions,
norfolk
and
virginia
beach
sit
side
by
side.
they’re
different
types
of
cities,
they
have
different
problems.
the
city
of
norfolk
in
its
brief
has
painted
this
picture
very
clearly,
much
more
clearly,
i
am
afraid,
than
i
could
have
done.
it
is
pointed
out
that
the
interest
of
budding
political
subdivisions
can
be
adverse
and
then
it
lists
areas
in
which
they
are
adverse.
in
the
question
of
water
supply
or
the
regulation
of
water
rates
and
services,
norfolk
has
got
all
the
water;
virginia
beach
has
none.
virginia
beach
has
to
rely
on
norfolk
for
water
service
and
in
matters
of
this
area,
if
legislative
policy
is
involved,
their
interests
are
different.
the
piggy-back
income
tax
is
something
that
norfolk
would
desperately
like
to
have
as
would
any
core
city.
virginia
beach
of
a
different
nature
would
not
like
to
have
it.
so,
community
interests
are
sacrificed,
not
only
in
virginia
beach,
in
the
case
that
i
am
concerned
with,
but
they
are
sacrificed
everywhere
that
the
district
court
has
moved
lines
around
to
disregard
the
integrity,
purposefully
accorded
political
subdivisions
by
the
general
assembly.
nothing
is
being
given
in
return
for
getting
mathematical
equality.
there
are
at
least
nine
counties
and
two
cities
in
the
state
that
have
suffered
by
having
bunches
of
their
people
arbitrarily
put
here
or
there
by
the
district
court
plan.
so,
virginia
beach
is
a
prime
example
of
what
happens
when
the
political
subdivisions
are
ignored
in
this
instance.
now,
coming
to
the
remedies
in
the
case,
there
are
many
remedies
that
were
available
here
if
the
district
court
had
found
the
general
assemblies
plan
to
have
been
invalid.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
i
understand
that
it
is
not
being
represented.
it
was
an
intervener
as
--
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
it
is
indeed.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
i
think
they
have
sort
of
turned
around
and
joined
our
team.
i
think
--
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
well,
i
think
the
reason
they’re
not
being
represented
orally
is
the
limitation
on
the
number
of
counsel
permitted
to
argue.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
well,
i
interpreted
it
to
mean
this.
certainly,
norfolk
is
not
going
to
concede
our
point
that
it
should
suffer
any
loss
of
representation
for
the
gain
of
virginia
beach.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
quite
understandable,
but
they
also
recognize
the
importance
that
we
lay
stress
on
for
representation
of
local
government
in
the
lay
--
in
one
house
of
the
legislative
body
and
they
are
pointing
out
in
an
effective
way
the
particulars
in
their
case
where
interest
of
virginia
beach
and
norfolk
are
so
different.
that
is
my
understanding
of
--
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
well,
i
think
their
position
is
that
the
general
assembly’s
plan
was
acceptable
and
should
have
been
upheld
and
this
is
a
justification
in
terms
of
their
particular
circumstances
for
upholding
the
general
assembly’s
plan
and
reversing
the
district
court.
now,
my
time
is
approximately
up.
what
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
is
the
matter
of
remedies
which
in
the
substantive
--
in
the
importance
of
the
substantive
area
cancel
easily
be
overworked.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
general
assembly
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
correct
this
situation
if
correction
was
needed.
the
general
assembly
was
standing
by,
willing
to
act.
it
had
time
to
act.
it
could
act
quickly.
it
has
acted
effectively
before
when
it
has
been
told
to
correct
its
reapportionment,
but
it
was
not
accorded
that
time.
at
the
worst,
the
court
could
have
said,
“alright,
hold
your
1971
elections
under
this
plan
but
fix
it
for
next
time”
and
that’s
what
it
did
and
what
it
specifically
approved
in
the
arizona
case,
ely
versus
klahr
where
three
successive
reapportionment
plans
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
and
the
district
court
still
said,
“okay,
hold
it
under
this
invalid
plan,
but
fix
it
for
next
time.”
now,
even
if
the
district
court
should
be
so
bold
as
to
write
its
own
plan,
the
basic
concepts
of
due
process
require
that
you
at
least
give
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
here,
there
was
no
indication
as
to
what
the
court
would
do
on
this
case.
it
hadn’t
said
the
state’s
plan
was
unconstitutional.
it
had
not
made
any
effort.
no
parties
had
come
forward
and
talked
about
specific
relief.
how
could
virginia
beach
have
known
that
29,000
of
its
people
would
be
summarily
dumped
into
a
mammoth
district
over
in
norfolk?
these
interests
were
never
given
any
chance
to
be
heard,
so
that
regardless
of
the
validity
of
the
general
assembly’s
plan
in
an
unfairness
and
violation
of
due
process
by
the
district
court
demands
reversal.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
city
of
virginia
beach
stands
shoulder
by
shoulder
with
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
in
upholding
the
general
assembly’s
house
redistricting
plan
and
in
urging
the
reversal
of
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case.
the
city
of
virginia
beach
is
not
involved
in
the
senate
side
of
the
controversy.
our
position
here
this
morning
is
that
a
state
reapportionment
plan
should
be
judged
not
solely
on
mathematical
comparisons,
but
it
should
be
judged
also
on
the
quality
of
the
representation
that
it
affords
the
people.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
court
cannot
uphold
the
district
court
below,
without
overruling
a
great
deal
of
what
this
court
said
in
reynolds
against
sims.
the
district
court
plan
itself
contains
significant
deviations
from
population
equality
without
any
policy
justification
whatsoever.
the
district
court
said
in
its
opinion
this.
“while
we
have
endeavored
to
reach
a
perfect
mathematical
division,
we
had
been
unable
to
do
so
because
of
the
multiplicity
of
delegates,
the
geography
of
the
state,
and
the
diversity
of
population
concentrations.”
so,
if
you
look
at
numbers
and
that’s
all
the
district
court
did,
its
own
plan
comes
up
with
a
variation
of
10%
but
no
basis
of
that
was
given,
no
effort
was
made
to
justify
that
kind
of
variation
at
all.
as
the
attorney
general
has
pointed
out,
the
greater
variation
in
the
virginia
plan
was
the
result
of
a
rational
basis,
a
desire
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
political
subdivisions
and
to
give
them
an
effective
voice
in
one
house
of
the
general
assembly.
now,
if
the
district
court
was
serious
in
what
it
said
and
was
going
to
abide
by
the
numbers
alone,
it
could
have
done
a
whole
lot
better
job
than
it
did.
so,
without
being
able
to
do
better
than
it
did
and
without
affording
any
basis
whatsoever
for
its
position,
we
think
its
plan
must
fall.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
very
definitely,
we
feel
that
this
court
has
leaned
over
backwards
on
occasion
after
occasion
to
say
that
policy
decision
is
one
for
the
legislature,
not
for
the
district
court
at
all.
and
we
propose
to
emphasize
this
in
several
ways
before
we
are
through
today
but
we
feel
and
one
of
their
arguments
is
that
there
is
a
fundamental
violation
of
due
process
when
the
district
court
arbitrarily
took
the
bit
in
its
teeth
and
said,
this
is
your
plan.
this,
we
think
is
a
second,
but
very
important
phase
of
the
problem
before
the
court
today.
now,
returning
to
the
basic
problem
of
state
reapportionment,
we
think
that
a
fundamental
principle
here
is
that
reynolds
rejects
mathematical
precision
as
a
constitutional
requirement
and
recognizes
the
validity
of
representation
of
political
subdivisions
as
such.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
that
is
our
position--
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
and
as
that
is
brought
down
today
in
kirkpatrick,
the
phrase
as
nearly
as
practicable
appears
whereas
in
reynolds,
construing
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
is
substantial
equality.
and
what
we
are
faced
with
today,
i
believe,
is
the
first
opportunity
the
court
has
had
to
decide
the
question.
what
worry
--
what
right
are
we
headed
in
the
decade
of
the
70’s?
do
they
mean
the
same
thing,
these
phrases,
or
do
they
not?
we,
of
course,
submit
that
they
do
not.
now,
we
find
that
there
is
no
place,
no
valid
place
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
a
representation
of
political
subdivisions
as
such
because
in
congress,
we
are
concerned
with
the
formulation
of
national
policy.
and
the
interest
of
the
states
are
being
represented,
yes,
but
cities,
counties,
we
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
basis
that
we
can
argue
here
for
our
saying
that
they
need
to
be
separately
heard.
and
i
think
this
is
evidenced
by
the
historical
fact
that
for
the
first
50
years
of
our
country,
you
had
at
large
representations
in
many
congressional
districts.
but
there
is
a
place
in
the
states
for
this
type
of
representation
and
we
think
this
court
specifically
so
stated
in
reynolds.
local
government
entities
are
frequently
charged
with
various
responsibilities
incident
to
the
operation
of
state
government.
in
many
states,
much
of
the
legislature’s
activity
involves
the
enactment
of
so-called
local
legislation
directed
only
to
the
concerns
of
political
subdivisions.
we
see
no
reason
why
that
is
not
as
valid
today
as
it
was
in
1964
and
when
we
look
at
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
session
of
its
general
assembly,
most
recently
held,
a
104
of
a
133
local
bills
were
introduced
in
the
house
of
delegates.
this
is
where
the
localities
find
their
primary
voice
and
their
primary
source
of
representation.
so,
that
we
think,
has
a
rational
basis
to
support
it.
we
feel
that
there
are
numbers
of
phrases,
points,
in
the
reynolds
decision
that
must
be
overlooked,
swept
out
under
the
rug
if
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
is
to
be
upheld.
now,
what
is
the
result
of
affirming
that
decision
of
the
lower
court?
first,
reapportionment
will
then
be
reduced
to
a
mathematical
exercise.
if
this
court
is
to
say
today,
kirkpatrick
governs
congressional
and
state
reapportionment
then
all
we
got
to
do
is
become
a
slave
to
numbers
maybe
even
to
computers
and
little
judgment
will
be
exercised.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
policy
decisions
were
no
longer
be
permitted
in
how
you
structure
at
least
one
house
of
the
legislature,
either
house
of
the
legislature,
you
do
it
by
the
numbers.
then
we
would
be
concerned
only
with
the
extremes
of
the
variations
in
the
numbers
and
that’s
what
the
district
court
did
here.
it
took
the
most
over-represented,
the
most
under-represented,
and
added
up
the
percentages
and
said,
that’s
bad,
we
can’t
have
it.
you
do
it
our
way
and
this
is
our
plan,
but
what
happens
here,
you
have
no
quality
of
representation.
no
consideration
of
who
the
people
in
a
given
jurisdiction
can
vote
for.
political
subdivisions
will
be
largely
ignored
as
such,
this
mix
of
rendering
obsolete
bicameral
legislatures.
what
will
be
the
difference
between
the
senate
and
the
house
of
delegates
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
or
any
other
of
the
states?
the
differences
would
merely
be
how
long
the
members
are
elected
for
and
how
many
people
they
represent;
the
size
of
the
districts.
the
only
validity
that
i
can
see
for
affirming
the
district
court
would
be
to
achieve
the
uniformity
in
congressional
and
state
reapportionment
mechanics,
possibly
this
would
cut
down
on
the
amount
of
litigation.
i
am
not
a
bit
sure
that
it
would
but
what
is
the
prize
that
you
pay
for
doing
this.
we
think
there
is
a
loss
of
quality
in
representation.
we
think
the
fallacy
of
the
district
court
numbers
game
is
demonstrated
very
clearly
in
the
case
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
what
happened
at
virginia
beach?
the
general
assembly’s
plan
there
was
not
perfect.
according
to
mr.
duval’s
theory
of
valuing
floater
delegates,
virginia
beach
was
represented
--
under
represented
by
7.3%.
the
district
court
reduced
that
under
representation
to
approximately
2.5%,
but
it
took
29,000
virginia
beach
citizens,
put
them
over
into
norfolk’s
multimember
district,
where
they
now
vote
with
307,000
people
in
a
seven-member
district.
so,
what
has
happened
to
the
quality
of
the
representation
for
those
29,000
people?
they’re
not
a
part
of
virginia
beach.
they
must
vote
for
norfolk
and
how
will
the
delegates
in
the
general
assembly
from
norfolk
feel
if
a
matter
comes
before
the
general
assembly
that
pits
norfolk,
the
interest
of
norfolk
against
that
of
virginia
beach.
obviously,
they’re
not
going
to
go
with
the
29,000;
they’re
going
to
go
with
the
307,000.
the
district
court
has
sacrificed
the
community
interest
of
virginia
beach.
now,
this
is
done
too
in
the
senate
because
40,000
members
of
the
senate,
in
the
senate
--
40,000
of
virginia
beach
people
in
the
senate
district
are
combined
with
75,000
norfolk
citizens
in
a
multimember
district.
i
am
sorry
what
was
started
off
as
a
single-member
district,
it
is
now
a
multimember
district;
40,000
virginia
beach
citizens
and
307,000
norfolk
citizens,
the
same
sort
of
thing.
now,
we
could
live
with
this
in
the
senate.
we
find
it
hard
to
live
with,
in
both
houses
where
the
discrimination
against
virginia
beach
is
so
pointed.
one
right
to
have
solved
this,
if
the
court
is
the
final
arbiter
of
these
political
decisions,
was
not
to
take
29,000
from
virginia
beach
and
put
them
over
in
norfolk’s
multimember
district.
it
would
have
been
to
move
one
seat
to
virginia
beach
and
take
13,000
norfolkians
and
put
them
into
the
virginia
beach,
saying,
to
reverse
the
flow,
if
you
will,
to
balance
some
equities
but
the
court
didn’t
do
that.
this
comes
back
to
a
question
of
remedies,
to
a
question
of
policy
on
which
the
city
of
virginia
beach
had
no
say.
but
coming
back
to
the
subject
of
community
interest
to
making
effective
representation
in
the
general
assembly
for
political
subdivisions,
norfolk
and
virginia
beach
sit
side
by
side.
they’re
different
types
of
cities,
they
have
different
problems.
the
city
of
norfolk
in
its
brief
has
painted
this
picture
very
clearly,
much
more
clearly,
i
am
afraid,
than
i
could
have
done.
it
is
pointed
out
that
the
interest
of
budding
political
subdivisions
can
be
adverse
and
then
it
lists
areas
in
which
they
are
adverse.
in
the
question
of
water
supply
or
the
regulation
of
water
rates
and
services,
norfolk
has
got
all
the
water;
virginia
beach
has
none.
virginia
beach
has
to
rely
on
norfolk
for
water
service
and
in
matters
of
this
area,
if
legislative
policy
is
involved,
their
interests
are
different.
the
piggy-back
income
tax
is
something
that
norfolk
would
desperately
like
to
have
as
would
any
core
city.
virginia
beach
of
a
different
nature
would
not
like
to
have
it.
so,
community
interests
are
sacrificed,
not
only
in
virginia
beach,
in
the
case
that
i
am
concerned
with,
but
they
are
sacrificed
everywhere
that
the
district
court
has
moved
lines
around
to
disregard
the
integrity,
purposefully
accorded
political
subdivisions
by
the
general
assembly.
nothing
is
being
given
in
return
for
getting
mathematical
equality.
there
are
at
least
nine
counties
and
two
cities
in
the
state
that
have
suffered
by
having
bunches
of
their
people
arbitrarily
put
here
or
there
by
the
district
court
plan.
so,
virginia
beach
is
a
prime
example
of
what
happens
when
the
political
subdivisions
are
ignored
in
this
instance.
now,
coming
to
the
remedies
in
the
case,
there
are
many
remedies
that
were
available
here
if
the
district
court
had
found
the
general
assemblies
plan
to
have
been
invalid.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
i
understand
that
it
is
not
being
represented.
it
was
an
intervener
as
--
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
it
is
indeed.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
i
think
they
have
sort
of
turned
around
and
joined
our
team.
i
think
--
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
well,
i
think
the
reason
they’re
not
being
represented
orally
is
the
limitation
on
the
number
of
counsel
permitted
to
argue.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
well,
i
interpreted
it
to
mean
this.
certainly,
norfolk
is
not
going
to
concede
our
point
that
it
should
suffer
any
loss
of
representation
for
the
gain
of
virginia
beach.
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
quite
understandable,
but
they
also
recognize
the
importance
that
we
lay
stress
on
for
representation
of
local
government
in
the
lay
--
in
one
house
of
the
legislative
body
and
they
are
pointing
out
in
an
effective
way
the
particulars
in
their
case
where
interest
of
virginia
beach
and
norfolk
are
so
different.
that
is
my
understanding
of
--
mr.
harry
frazier,
iii
well,
i
think
their
position
is
that
the
general
assembly’s
plan
was
acceptable
and
should
have
been
upheld
and
this
is
a
justification
in
terms
of
their
particular
circumstances
for
upholding
the
general
assembly’s
plan
and
reversing
the
district
court.
now,
my
time
is
approximately
up.
what
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
is
the
matter
of
remedies
which
in
the
substantive
--
in
the
importance
of
the
substantive
area
cancel
easily
be
overworked.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
general
assembly
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
correct
this
situation
if
correction
was
needed.
the
general
assembly
was
standing
by,
willing
to
act.
it
had
time
to
act.
it
could
act
quickly.
it
has
acted
effectively
before
when
it
has
been
told
to
correct
its
reapportionment,
but
it
was
not
accorded
that
time.
at
the
worst,
the
court
could
have
said,
“alright,
hold
your
1971
elections
under
this
plan
but
fix
it
for
next
time”
and
that’s
what
it
did
and
what
it
specifically
approved
in
the
arizona
case,
ely
versus
klahr
where
three
successive
reapportionment
plans
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
and
the
district
court
still
said,
“okay,
hold
it
under
this
invalid
plan,
but
fix
it
for
next
time.”
now,
even
if
the
district
court
should
be
so
bold
as
to
write
its
own
plan,
the
basic
concepts
of
due
process
require
that
you
at
least
give
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
here,
there
was
no
indication
as
to
what
the
court
would
do
on
this
case.
it
hadn’t
said
the
state’s
plan
was
unconstitutional.
it
had
not
made
any
effort.
no
parties
had
come
forward
and
talked
about
specific
relief.
how
could
virginia
beach
have
known
that
29,000
of
its
people
would
be
summarily
dumped
into
a
mammoth
district
over
in
norfolk?
these
interests
were
never
given
any
chance
to
be
heard,
so
that
regardless
of
the
validity
of
the
general
assembly’s
plan
in
an
unfairness
and
violation
of
due
process
by
the
district
court
demands
reversal.
thank
you.
