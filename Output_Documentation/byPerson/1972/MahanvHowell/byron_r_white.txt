justice

i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
you
don't
attack
the
census
figures
at
all.
they
were
quite
accurate
for
what
they
showed.
the
only
thing
is
they
didn't
show
where
people
lived
and
that
the
census
figures
were
used,
they
were
permissibly
used
but
they
were
used
in
the
wrong
way
in
the
sense
that
the
census
figures
didn’t
purport
to
show
where
people
lived,
only
whether
they
were
home
ported?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn’t
that
have
been
sensible
for
the
district
court
to
have
allocated
between
the
three
districts
a
certain
proportion
of
the
sailors
who
were
said
not
to
live
where
the
census
put
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
objected
if
the
court
had
said
we
are
going
to
split
these
military
people
equally
between
the
three
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
not
believe
in
them
but
the
legislature
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
very
interesting
point
as
to
what
the
district
court
was
permitted
to
do.
if
it
could
have
observed
the
legislative
policy,
why
shouldn’t
it
have
done
so,
if
it
could
have
done
so
permissibly?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
legislative
plan
that
said
single-member
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
was
the
plan
was,
wasn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
it
was,
the
plan
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
legislative
plan
that
was
declared
unconstitutional,
opted
for
single-member
districts
in
the
senate?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
argument
that
as
the
legislature
--
but
what
about
the
relevance
of
this
to
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
district
court
was
applied
to
do
what
it
did
rather
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then,
even
if
they
have
done
anything
wrong
with
the
single-member
district
seem
so
far
as
the
allocation
of
the
military
was
concerned,
you
would
have
argued
that
single-member
districts
in
that
area
was
unconstitutional
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
court
plan
do
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
underrepresented,
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
duval,
if
you
assume
the
court
thought
that
the
particular
variations
in
this
case
were
justified
by
respect
for
county
lines
or
something
like
that.
was
there
some
plan
put
forward
in
this
case
to
--
that
would
have
cured
that
and
still
have
respected
the
state
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
did
you
propose
a
different
arrangement
on
multimember
districts
in
northern
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
issue
is
not
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
you
propose
that
if
there
were
going
to
be
multimember
districts
they
ought
to
be
only
one,
or
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
know
many
of
the
9,500
live
outside
of
the
five,
six
and
seventh?
justice
byron

some
live
in

that’s
right.

in

now,
based
on

tract
