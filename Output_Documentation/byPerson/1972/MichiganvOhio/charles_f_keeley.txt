mr.
charles
f.
keeley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
michigan
instituted
this
action
back
in
1966
tactically
on
the
invitation
of
governor
rhodes
who
indicated
that
it
would
be
quicker
to
solve
the
controversy
between
the
north
cape
of
maumee
bay
to
the
international
boundary.
we
filed
this
matter
with
this
court
was
referred
to
special
master
maris
for
hearing.
he
held
several
hearings
and
finally
he
made
a
report.
it
is
this
report
for
which
michigan
has
found
some
exceptions.
the
first
exception
that
the
state
of
michigan
finds
is
that
the
special
master
did
not
correctly
relocate
the
north
cape
of
maumee
bay.
i
would
refer
you
to
finding
number
31
in
which
he
said
that
the
location
of
the
north
cape
of
maumee
bay
can
be
found
by
referring
to
captain
anthony
--
to
captain
a.
talcott’s
survey.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
yes,
sir?
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
yes,
page
15.
at
that
time,
it
was
recognized
by
the
special
master
that
that
is
a
correct
conclusion
as
to
what
the
north
cape
of
maumee
bay
was
in
1835.
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
say
that
the
north
cape
had
washed
away
by
1836.
so
we
would
submit
that
this
is
the
better
method
of
finding
the
north
cape
of
maumee
bay
and
we’d
also
like
to
cite
the
matter
of
chinoweth
versus
haskell,
which
28
united
states
reports
page
92.
this
case
said
that
courses
and
distances
should
be
regarded
in
locating
boundaries.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
no,
i
think
the
rules
in
that
this
case
began,
your
honor,
is
because
there
was
oil
and
gas
believed
to
have
been
underneath
this
water
and
additionally
there
have
been
some
other
mineral
developments
that
are
not
in
the
record
at
all
but
are
important
to
both
states.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
when
the
special
master
made
his
relocation
of
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay,
he
did
not
determine
pursuant
to
the
statute
of
1836,
that’s
june
15,
1836,
but
he
relied
on
the
survey
by
engineer
gannet
when
there
was
a
joint
commission
between
--
provided
by
these
two
states
to
survey
the
land
boundary.
and
when
he
relocated
that
line,
he
used
the
same
degree
of
measurement
from
post
70
to
71
until
it
intersected
with
itself,
45
degree
angle
from
the
existing
seawall
on
turtle
island.
that
is
why
we
believe
that
our
position
is
correct
because
it
is
a
contemporary
with
the
statute
of
1836.
it
was
a
statute
and
a
report
of
which
was
before
the
congress
at
that
time
that
the
statute
was
passed.
judge
maris
assumed
that
the
line
would
be
north
87
degrees
49
minutes
and
44
seconds
east
and
there
is
no
way
you
can
do
that
except
by
going
back
to
this
previous
survey
in
the
teams
of
the
1900,
teams
of
the
20th
century,
and
this
is
not
where
it
should
--
should
have
located.
he
should
have
gone
back
to
the
survey
just
prior
to
the
passing
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
what
island
would
be
in
michigan?
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
i
am
not
aware
that
he
did
say
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
okay.
thank
you.
we
take
a
very
fundamental
disagreement
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
special
master
said.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
i
believe
it’s
on
page
29
of
his
report
that
the
statute
of
1836,
june
15th
of
1836
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
we
feel
that
this
statute
was
not
clear
and
unambiguous.
we
say
that
the
24th
congress
itself
felt
the
statute
was
not
clear
and
unambiguous,
because
only
eight
days
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
they
came
and
enacted
another
statute
to
define
the
northern
boundary
of
the
state
of
ohio.
and
if
you
look
at
the
statutes,
they
are
almost
identical
from
the
point
of
view
whether
they
ae
--
thence,
northeast
to
the
international
boundary
line.
therefore,
we
believe
that
you
must
take
another
look
at
the
statute
and
recreate
the
history
by
which
it
was
enacted.
we
also
put
into
evidence
the
case,
the
witness,
ralph
berry
who
comes
with
imminent
qualifications.
he
is
a
civil
engineer,
he
is
a
professor
of
geodesy
at
the
university
of
michigan
and
he
has
testified
on
page
88
of
the
record
that
this
is
a
matter
that
it
is
not
clear
and
unambiguous.
they
have
to
take
into
consideration
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
have
this
court
consider
the
fact
that
the
special
master
included
in
his
definition
of
the
boundary
line
from
the
north
cape
to
the
international
boundary
line,
turtle
island,
and
in
no
way
was
turtle
island
a
part
of
the
statutory
language
defining
this
boundary.
turtle
island
was
a
point
of
reference
by
captain
a.
talcott
to
locate
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
he
referred
to
--
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
but
as
far
as
the
statute
creating
the
boundary
line
is
concerned,
that
only
relocates
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
from
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay.
there
is
no
reference
at
all
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
northeast
course,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
and
he
maintains
that
further
on
the
grounds
that
the
case
is
--
that
the
statute
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
i
would
think
there
is
any
perfect
way
to
achieve
anything
except
i
think
you
can
follow
the
statute
and
if
you
want
to
call
that
as
a
perfect
remedy,
that’s
--
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
yes,
i
see
what
you
mean
mr.
chief
justice.
if
you
are
going
to
do
that,
i
suspect
to
one
of
the
things
you
might
look
at
would
be
taking
a
perpendicular
line
to
the
north
cape
and
draw
that
as
the
line
which
would
separate
the
two
states,
and
--
but
that
was
not
in
the
evidence,
that’s
why
i
would
hesitate
to
call
that
to
your
attention
at
this
time,
but
i
think
that
would
be
one
way
in
which
the
parties
on
both
sides
of
the
bay
would
get
what
was
perhaps
given
to
them
by
the
congress.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
perpendicular
to
the
bay.
that’s
one
of
the
problems
that
would
be
confronted
with
any
--
determination
of
that
is
to
find
out
what
the
bay
consists
of.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
that’s
right.
that’s
approximately
what
it
would
be.
and
would
it
be
from
the
north
cape
down
to
kelley’s
island
or
would
it
be
embraced
from
the
end
of
the
detroit
river
down
to
some
other
group
of
islands
across
the
bay,
across
the
lake.
i
don't
have
anything
more.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
f.
keeley
i
have
nothing,
