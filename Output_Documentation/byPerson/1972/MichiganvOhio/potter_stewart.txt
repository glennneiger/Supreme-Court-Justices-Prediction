justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
that’s
the
only
way
the
that
the
special
master
used
it
and
what
he
did
was
to
use
the
old
lighthouse,
which
was
located
on
turtle
island
within
a
very
small
margin
of
era,
and
he
reversed
the
northeast
course
backwardly.
what
we’ve
got
is
in
sailing
in
cal
of
45-degree
course,
he
reversed
it
backwardly
into
a
225-degree
course
to
get
to
line,
isn’t
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
through
the
old
lighthouse?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
way
i
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
reference
is
to
a
northeast
course,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
northeast
means
45
degrees,
so
the
special
master
held
and
your
claim
is
that
it
means
generally
northeastwardly
following
the
previous
line,
isn’t
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
which
would
be
just
a
couple
of
degrees
north
of
east,
isn’t
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
this
dispute,
this
general
dispute,
has
a
long,
long
history
doesn’t
it
mr.
rawlings
and
back
to
the
so-called
war
of
toledo
when
each
troops
from
michigan
and
troops
from
ohio
were
well
on
their
way
to
a
confrontation
over
this
boundary
dispute?
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
that?
in
1930’s?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
done
with
the
prospect
that
michigan
would
pass
a
concurrent
resolution
but
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
michigan
did
so.
justice
