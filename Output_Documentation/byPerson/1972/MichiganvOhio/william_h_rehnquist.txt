justice
william

rehnquist
do
you
mean
a
line
across
the
mouth
of
the
bay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rawlings,
would
congress
have
had
any
reason
to
think
that
a
line
between
the
southern
tip
of
lake
michigan
and
the
north
cape
of
maumee
bay
would
have
been
an
east-west
line
as
opposed
to
perhaps
a
more
northeasterly
line
than
it
turned
out
to
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
then
you
say
that
the
congress
knew
this
in
1836?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
they
knew
that
the
line
were
northeast,
doesn’t
that
give
some
plausibility
to
michigan’s
contention
that
when
it
speaks
of
the
northeast
projection
out
into
the
lake
that
they
meant
simply
a
continuation
of
the
land
boundary?
