mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
involved
in
the
michigan-ohio
boundary
dispute
as
it
goes
through
lake
erie
or
basically
to
the
enabling
legislation
at
issue
of
course
is
the
legislation
of
june
15,
1836,
which
legislation
established
the
northern
boundary
line
of
the
state
of
ohio,
and
provided
for
the
admission
of
the
then
territory
of
michigan
into
the
union
upon
the
conditions
expressed
in
that
statute.
one
of
the
conditions
expressed
was
that
michigan
specifically
ascent
to
the
boundary
line
as
set
forth
in
the
statute.
after
some
months
of
debate
in
the
territory
of
michigan,
michigan
did
ascent
in
december
of
1836
and
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
january
of
1837.
the
boundary
description,
of
course,
as
it
affects
us
in
this
particular
dispute,
extends
from
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
to
the
most
northerly
cape
of
the
maumee
bay,
the
most
northerly
cape
as
it
existed
in
1836
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
before
us,
and
from
that
point,
northeast
to
the
international
boundary
line
between
united
states
and
canada.
it
is
and
has
been
ohio’s
position
throughout
the
course
of
this
controversy
that
the
term
northeast
used
in
the
1836
legislation
means
halfway
between
north
and
east
or
in
equal
point
from
each,
and
in
terms
of
degrees
that
would
translate
into
north
45
degrees
east.
we
feel
that
a
statute
embodying
this
term
is
clear
and
free
from
ambiguity,
and
if
that
is
so,
it
is
not
necessary
to
look
to
contemporary
historical
documentation,
such
as
in
evidence
in
this
particular
case,
in
order
to
locate
the
direction
of
the
course
from
the
former
north
cape
to
the
international
boundary
line.
if
one
accepts
ohio’s
premise
in
the
special
master’s
conclusion
that
northeast
means
north
45
degrees
east,
we
are
still
left
with
the
problem
of
relocating
the
former
position
of
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay.
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay,
as
it
existed
in
1836,
has
been
subject
to
considerable
erosion
at
that
time
and,
of
course,
no
longer
occupies
its
former
position.
in
trying
to
reach
a
solution
to
this
problem,
we
are
aided
by
several
factors.
initially,
we
know
that
the
land
portion
of
the
boundary
line
between
michigan
and
ohio
was
monumented
and
surveyed
by
joint
agreement
between
the
two
states
in
1915,
and
currently
terminates
at
what
is
known
as
post
71
which
is
the
easternmost
terminal
monument
going
toward
the
former
land
position
of
the
north
cape
as
it
existed
in
1836.
that
land
boundary
has
been
unchallenged
so
far
as
we
are
aware
since
1915
and
it
does
follow
a
defined
course.
we
are
further
aided
--
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
apparently
--
well,
of
course
the
dispute
between
the
two
states
was
settled
in
1836
by
virtue
of
the
enabling
legislation.
apparently,
from
1836
until
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century,
the
territory
around
toledo
and
lucas
county
and
what
is
northwestern
ohio
was
not
fully
developed
to
an
extent
to
cause
too
much
confusion.
the
report
of
the
survey,
an
engineer’s
report
in
1915,
last
says,
the
cause
of
the
survey,
the
fact
that
land
values
have
been
appreciating
rapidly
in
the
toledo-lucas
county
area
and
also
states
in
the
course
of
its
report
that
there
was
considerable
apprehension
among
the
citizens,
because
of
this
increase
in
land
value
as
to
where
the
boundary
lay,
and
it
was
therefore
felt
necessary
by
both
states
of
ohio
and
michigan
to
permanently
monument
that
particular
boundary.
in
so
doing,
they
attempted
to
retrace
the
boundary
as
set
forth
and
monumented
by
william
harris
in
the
year
1817.
the
stated
reason
again
in
the
1915
report
is
that
land
had
been
increasing
and
there
was
enough
concern
on
the
part
of
all
land
owners
in
the
area
to,
at
this
point
in
time,
warrant
a
survey
of
the
land
boundary.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
yes,
it
does
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
misunderstanding,
of
course,
originally
given
rise
to
the
dispute.
it
was
due
to
the
incorrect
position
of
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
as
shown
on
most
of
the
maps
of
the
day,
and
they
further
dispute
between
the
states
as
to
whether
the
boundary
line
on
the
land
portion
should
go
from
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
to
the
north
cape
of
maumee
bay
or
should
be
a
due
east
line
from
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
as
your
--
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
yes,
although
when
one
considers
that
ohio
and
michigan
are
part
of
the
five
states
carved
out
of
the
northwest
territory
and
further
considers
that
at
that
point
in
time,
lake
michigan
was
perhaps
the
only
known
physical
feature
of
that
area,
which
could
be
located
other
than
the
ohio
river
on
the
south
and
the
pennsylvania
line
on
the
east.
it
isn’t
too
surprising
because
congress
was
concerned
itself
with
carving
out
three
states
at
least,
perhaps
five,
out
of
the
northwest
territory.
it
is
surprising
in
the
sense
that
the
position
of
lake
michigan
or
at
least
its
southern
extreme,
as
shown
on
the
prevailing
maps
of
the
day,
primarily
mitchell’s
map
of
1755,
was
generally
assumed
to
be
quite
valid
and
showed
a
latitude
of
42
degrees,
30
minutes
north,
whereas
in
fact
the
position,
as
shown,
was
considerably
north
of
its
true
position.
this
error
and
this
mistake
and
what
everyone,
prior
to
around
1818,
had
considered
a
rather
fixed
monument
from
which
to
draw
a
boundary
was
the
cause
of
considerable
historical
prevalence
between
ohio
and
michigan,
and
as
it
has
been
alluded
to,
almost
caused
a
war
between
the
two
states.
only
the
personal
intervention
of
president
jackson
and
a
considerable
diplomatic
maneuvering
prevented
armed
conflict
between
ohio
and
michigan.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
by
the
time
a
legislation
of
1836
had
been
enacted
the
true
position
of
the
southerly
extreme
of
lake
michigan
was
known.
and
that
true
position
fall
south
of
the
north
cape.
so
that
a
line
drawn
due
east
from
the
true
position
of
the
southerly
extreme
of
lake
michigan
would
not
strike
the
north
cape
at
all
but
would
strike
several
miles
below
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
i
believe
in
1836
congress
knew
the
physical
fact
of
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
much
better
than
they
had
realized
it
prior
to
that
time.
they
had
taken
into
consideration
many
arguments
from
senators
and
representative
from
both
the
state
of
ohio
and
to
then
territory
of
michigan
and
a
memorial
sent
to
congress
and
to
the
executive
branch,
most
of
this
documentation
is
an
evidence
in
this
proceeding
and
before
the
special
master.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
due
east
line
which
was
striven
for
by
the
territory
or
michigan,
up
until
the
enactment
of
the
1836
legislation,
was
rejected
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
congress
in
so
reject
in
it
recognized
in
effect
the
ohio
proviso
to
the
constitution
of
1802,
and
extended
of
the
boundary
northeast.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
considerably
more
logical
to
believe
that
congress,
in
using
the
term
northeast,
meant
north
45
degrees
east
than
to
conclude
that
they
meant
a
line
which
although
true
it
is
about
2
degrees
10
seconds
north
of
east,
comes
very
close
in
practical
effect
being
due
east
line.
i
think
if
congress
had
meant
to
extend
the
existing
land
boundary
according
to
the
talcott
survey
of
1834,
they
might
well
have
used
the
language
in
the
legislation
appropriate
to
the
purpose,
either
indicating
direct
to
the
international
boundary
line
or
using
phraseology
more
appropriate
to
that
end.
the
turtle
island
which
has
been
referred
to
and
considerably
in
the
briefs
and
arguments
before
the
special
master
and
in
argument
this
morning,
is
a
small
island
located
by
captain
talcott
in
1834
and
its
existence
was
known
prior
to
that
time
at
the
mouth
of
the
maumee
bay.
it
is
located
approximately
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
maumee
bay
and
we
know,
by
reference
to
historical
surveys
and
evidence
in
this
proceeding
that
a
line
drawn
north
45
degrees
east
was
passed
through
the
existing
circular
concrete
seawall
on
turtle
island.
now,
we
have
never
contended
in
the
course
of
this
proceeding
that
the
existence
of
turtle
island
is
determinative
of
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
northeast,
clearly
it
is
not.
it
is
relevant,
however,
if
one
accepts
the
basic
premise
that
northeast
means
north
45
degrees
east.
by
reference
to
historical
survey
as
we
know
that
a
line
drawn
north
45
degrees
east
will
pass
through
that
island.
it
is
then
logical
to
reverse
that
known
col
south
45
degrees
west
until
we
strike
the
projection
of
the
known
and
existing
line
boundary
line
monumented
in
1915.
it
is
at
that
point
in
time
that
both
ohio
and
the
special
master
contend
one
has
relocated
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay
with
about
as
much
practicable
accuracy
as
one
can
hope
for
i
think
when
one
is
trying
to
locate
a
point
which
is
not
been
in
existence
since
well
before
the
middle
of
the
19th
century.
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay,
therefore
under
that
theory,
would
be
readily
ascertained
and
turtle
island
would
serve
as
a
convenient
fixed
boundary
or
monument
readily
seen
by
anyone
sailing
in
and
out
of
maumee
as
a
memorial
or
monument
on
the
boundary
line.
throughout
the
course
of
michigan’s
arguments
both
before
the
special
master
and
in
this
court,
there
has
been
reference
to
the
survey
made
by
captain
andrew
talcott
in
1834.
and
of
course,
michigan’s
basic
position
in
this
litigation
is
that,
that
survey
or
at
least
a
computation
or
an
extension
of
the
line
of
that
survey
through
mathematical
computations
of
its
witness
called
in
this
proceeding,
should
be
extended
in
a
northeasterly
direction
about
2
degrees
north
of
east
to
the
international
boundary
line.
we
would
point
out
that
congress
in
1836
when
it
enacted
the
statute
providing
for
the
admission
of
the
territory
of
michigan
into
the
union
had
before
it
three
basic
surveys.
it
had
before
the
harris
survey
of
1817,
which
was
drawn
in
accordance
with
the
ohio
proviso
and
went
from
the
southerly
extreme
of
lake
michigan
to
the
most
northerly
cape
of
the
maumee
bay.
it
had
before
the
fulton
survey,
which
was
a
due
east
line
drawn
really
at
the
request
of
then
acting
governor
cass
of
the
territory
of
michigan
who
complained
that
the
harris
survey
was
not
drawn
in
accordance
with
then
existing
legislation.
and
the
talcott
survey
in
1834.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
which
indicates
at
all
that
congress
intended
to
extend
the
talcott
line
across
the
lake.
the
very
title
of
the
act
providing
for
the
talcott
survey
is
called
“an
act
preparatory
to
adjust
in
the
northern
boundary
of
the
state
of
ohio.”
and
apparently,
congress
at
least
has
revealed
in
the
michigan
exhibit
8
senate
report
on
the
territories,
felt
that
necessary
in
view
of
the
very
difficult
situation
which
had
developed
between
the
state
and
territory,
and
in
view
the
conflicting
claims
to
have
captain
talcott
ascertain
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
the
points
in
issue
prior
to
further
considering
the
arguments
between
the
state
and
territory
and
coming
to
a
conclusion
on
the
boundary.
it
did
come
to
a
conclusion
on
that
boundary
in
1836
and
that
conclusion
settled
the
issue
in
favor
of
the
state
of
ohio.
and
finally,
as
we
have
indicated,
if
the
position
is
adopted
that
the
legislation
of
1836
was
clear
on
its
face,
then
there
is
no
need
to
refer
to
debates
between
senators
and
congressmen
or
letters
addressed
to
congress
to
construe
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
but
if
this
court
determines
that
indeed,
in
accordance
with
the
claim
of
michigan,
the
statute
is
not
clear
on
its
face
that
there
is
some
ambiguity,
and
if
there
is
then
a
felt
need
to
refer
to
the
documentation
introduced
in
evidenced
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
a
review
of
that
documentation
will
not
support
the
claim
of
michigan.
we
point,
for
example,
to
michigan
exhibit
10
in
evidence
in
this
proceeding
particularly
pages
4
and
6
of
that
exhibit,
which
contain
statements
by
the
then
duly
authorized
representatives
of
the
territory
of
michigan
rejecting
admission
of
their
state
or
their
territory
into
the
union
because
they
could
not
live
with
the
boundary
lines
set
by
congress
in
the
statute,
and
noting
clearly
in
that
particular
documentation
that
michigan
knew
the
import
of
the
congressional
decision.
there
is
reference
in
that
exhibit
to
the
fact
that
ohio,
if
michigan
has
to
accede
to
this
proposition,
will
obtain
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
western
end
of
lake
erie,
almost
to
the
mouth
of
the
detroit
river
and
above
the
river
rouge.
michigan
decries
this,
they
say
it’s
unfair,
they
indicated
this
is
not
in
conformance
with
the
ordinance
of
1787,
they
indicated
this
is
not
in
conformance
with
the
legislation
of
1805
by
virtue
of
which
the
territory
of
michigan
was
formed
out
of
indiana
territory,
but
they
nonetheless
recognize
what
the
meaning
of
the
legislation
is.
and
after
rejecting
congress
proposal
twice,
finally
the
third
time
around
they
agreed
to
this
proposal
with
much
bitterness
in
ranker
as
is
revealed
in
the
debates
feeling
that
the
admission
into
the
union
and
the
advantages
of
the
statehood
outweighed
losing
a
position
for
which
they
had
striven
for
some
25
or
30
years
prior
to
that
time.
we
would
also
note
the
fact
as
it’s
revealed
in
the
documentation
and
evidence
in
this
case
most
of
it
supplied
by
michigan
that
under
a
theory
of
the
due
east
line
extending
from
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan,
the
theory
that
is
contained
in
the
statutes
before
the
exact
position
of
the
southern
extreme
of
lake
michigan
was
known.
and
under
the
maps
and
existence
of
that
time,
ohio
would
have
gotten
almost
all
of
lake
erie.
clearly,
it
seemed
that
congress
had
before
it
maps
of
the
lake
and
there
is
even
references
in
the
documentation
and
evidence
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
ohio
might
have
claimed
more
than
it
chose
to
claim,
had
it
not
inserted
the
proviso
indicating
that
the
boundary
should
be
established
to
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay.
the
reason
they
inserted
that
proviso,
i
believe
both
states
can
agree,
is
because
ohio
at
that
time
was
primarily
concerned
with
preserving
port
city
of
toledo
in
the
mouth
of
the
maumee
bay.
the
debate
between
the
two
states
prior
to
1836
over
what
was
referred
to
as
the
toledo
strip
being
concerned
with
those
points.
we
further
note
the
testimony
which
has
been
referred
to
in
argument
this
afternoon
and
was
discussed
extensively
in
briefing
and
argument
before
the
special
master
that
is
the
testimony
of
the
geodetic
engineer
of
the
university
of
michigan
called
on
behalf
of
michigan.
we
indicated
at
the
time
to
the
special
master
and
reiterate
our
position
this
afternoon
that
although
the
state
of
ohio
has
no
evidence
rebutting
the
mathematical
calculations
of
professor
berry
as
he
extends
the
talcott
line
across
the
lake
to
the
international
boundary
line,
we
consider
this
calculations
totally
irrelevant
if
this
court
believes
that
the
true
boundary,
as
revealed
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
north
45
degrees
east.
much
of
the
testimony
concerns
the
professor’s
opinion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
historical
documents
and
his
ultimate
conclusion
of
law
on
this
case,
we
consider
it
not
relevant
if
the
court
initially
holds
that
the
line
is
due
northeast.
and
finally
we
would
refer
the
court's
attention
to
the
other
exhibits
offered
by
ohio,
the
resolution
of
the
ohio
general
assembly
in
1933
defining
the
boundary
as
we
have
contended
it
to
be
today.
the
michigan
rescission
resolution
of
1945
in
which
they
agreed
with
the
state
of
ohio.
true
they
rescinded
that
resolution
two
years
later,
but
it
indicates
at
least
to
us
that
highly-placed
officials
of
the
state
of
michigan
at
that
point
in
time
were
aware
of
where
the
boundary
lay
and
agreed
with
ohio.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
yes,
the
ohio
general
assembly
passed
their
resolution
in
1933.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
yes,
specifically
stated
in
the
1933
resolution
as
the
hope
that
michigan
would
pass
a
like
resolution.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
they
did
in
1945
identical
to
that
of
ohio.
they
rescinded
that
resolution
on
1947
two
years
later.
and
that
is
where
the
matter
lay
until
--
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
--
the
filing
of
this
litigation.
we
would
also
refer
the
court’s
attention
respectfully
to
the
two
other
exhibits
submitted
by
ohio,
the
maps
of
the
erie
and
oregon
quadrangle
compiled
by
the
geodetic
service.
both
of
those
maps
show
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states
as
being
north
45
degrees
east
from
a
point
located
as
north
cape,
and
notations
at
the
top
of
those
exhibits
indicate
that
the
exhibits
were
prepared
in
collaboration
with
the
commissioner
of
highways
of
state
of
michigan.
in
summary,
therefore,
we
would
respectfully
urged
this
court
to
confirm
the
findings
and
the
conclusions
issued
by
judge
maris,
the
special
master
in
this
case,
and
to
enter
a
decree
in
this
matter
in
conformance
with
the
findings
and
conclusions,
and
recommend
the
decree
of
the
special
master.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
involved
in
the
michigan-ohio
boundary
dispute
as
it
goes
through
lake
erie
or
basically
to
the
enabling
legislation
at
issue
of
course
is
the
legislation
of
june
15,
1836,
which
legislation
established
the
northern
boundary
line
of
the
state
of
ohio,
and
provided
for
the
admission
of
the
then
territory
of
michigan
into
the
union
upon
the
conditions
expressed
in
that
statute.
one
of
the
conditions
expressed
was
that
michigan
specifically
ascent
to
the
boundary
line
as
set
forth
in
the
statute.
after
some
months
of
debate
in
the
territory
of
michigan,
michigan
did
ascent
in
december
of
1836
and
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
january
of
1837.
the
boundary
description,
of
course,
as
it
affects
us
in
this
particular
dispute,
extends
from
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
to
the
most
northerly
cape
of
the
maumee
bay,
the
most
northerly
cape
as
it
existed
in
1836
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
before
us,
and
from
that
point,
northeast
to
the
international
boundary
line
between
united
states
and
canada.
it
is
and
has
been
ohio’s
position
throughout
the
course
of
this
controversy
that
the
term
northeast
used
in
the
1836
legislation
means
halfway
between
north
and
east
or
in
equal
point
from
each,
and
in
terms
of
degrees
that
would
translate
into
north
45
degrees
east.
we
feel
that
a
statute
embodying
this
term
is
clear
and
free
from
ambiguity,
and
if
that
is
so,
it
is
not
necessary
to
look
to
contemporary
historical
documentation,
such
as
in
evidence
in
this
particular
case,
in
order
to
locate
the
direction
of
the
course
from
the
former
north
cape
to
the
international
boundary
line.
if
one
accepts
ohio’s
premise
in
the
special
master’s
conclusion
that
northeast
means
north
45
degrees
east,
we
are
still
left
with
the
problem
of
relocating
the
former
position
of
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay.
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay,
as
it
existed
in
1836,
has
been
subject
to
considerable
erosion
at
that
time
and,
of
course,
no
longer
occupies
its
former
position.
in
trying
to
reach
a
solution
to
this
problem,
we
are
aided
by
several
factors.
initially,
we
know
that
the
land
portion
of
the
boundary
line
between
michigan
and
ohio
was
monumented
and
surveyed
by
joint
agreement
between
the
two
states
in
1915,
and
currently
terminates
at
what
is
known
as
post
71
which
is
the
easternmost
terminal
monument
going
toward
the
former
land
position
of
the
north
cape
as
it
existed
in
1836.
that
land
boundary
has
been
unchallenged
so
far
as
we
are
aware
since
1915
and
it
does
follow
a
defined
course.
we
are
further
aided
--
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
apparently
--
well,
of
course
the
dispute
between
the
two
states
was
settled
in
1836
by
virtue
of
the
enabling
legislation.
apparently,
from
1836
until
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century,
the
territory
around
toledo
and
lucas
county
and
what
is
northwestern
ohio
was
not
fully
developed
to
an
extent
to
cause
too
much
confusion.
the
report
of
the
survey,
an
engineer’s
report
in
1915,
last
says,
the
cause
of
the
survey,
the
fact
that
land
values
have
been
appreciating
rapidly
in
the
toledo-lucas
county
area
and
also
states
in
the
course
of
its
report
that
there
was
considerable
apprehension
among
the
citizens,
because
of
this
increase
in
land
value
as
to
where
the
boundary
lay,
and
it
was
therefore
felt
necessary
by
both
states
of
ohio
and
michigan
to
permanently
monument
that
particular
boundary.
in
so
doing,
they
attempted
to
retrace
the
boundary
as
set
forth
and
monumented
by
william
harris
in
the
year
1817.
the
stated
reason
again
in
the
1915
report
is
that
land
had
been
increasing
and
there
was
enough
concern
on
the
part
of
all
land
owners
in
the
area
to,
at
this
point
in
time,
warrant
a
survey
of
the
land
boundary.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
yes,
it
does
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
misunderstanding,
of
course,
originally
given
rise
to
the
dispute.
it
was
due
to
the
incorrect
position
of
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
as
shown
on
most
of
the
maps
of
the
day,
and
they
further
dispute
between
the
states
as
to
whether
the
boundary
line
on
the
land
portion
should
go
from
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
to
the
north
cape
of
maumee
bay
or
should
be
a
due
east
line
from
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
as
your
--
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
yes,
although
when
one
considers
that
ohio
and
michigan
are
part
of
the
five
states
carved
out
of
the
northwest
territory
and
further
considers
that
at
that
point
in
time,
lake
michigan
was
perhaps
the
only
known
physical
feature
of
that
area,
which
could
be
located
other
than
the
ohio
river
on
the
south
and
the
pennsylvania
line
on
the
east.
it
isn’t
too
surprising
because
congress
was
concerned
itself
with
carving
out
three
states
at
least,
perhaps
five,
out
of
the
northwest
territory.
it
is
surprising
in
the
sense
that
the
position
of
lake
michigan
or
at
least
its
southern
extreme,
as
shown
on
the
prevailing
maps
of
the
day,
primarily
mitchell’s
map
of
1755,
was
generally
assumed
to
be
quite
valid
and
showed
a
latitude
of
42
degrees,
30
minutes
north,
whereas
in
fact
the
position,
as
shown,
was
considerably
north
of
its
true
position.
this
error
and
this
mistake
and
what
everyone,
prior
to
around
1818,
had
considered
a
rather
fixed
monument
from
which
to
draw
a
boundary
was
the
cause
of
considerable
historical
prevalence
between
ohio
and
michigan,
and
as
it
has
been
alluded
to,
almost
caused
a
war
between
the
two
states.
only
the
personal
intervention
of
president
jackson
and
a
considerable
diplomatic
maneuvering
prevented
armed
conflict
between
ohio
and
michigan.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
by
the
time
a
legislation
of
1836
had
been
enacted
the
true
position
of
the
southerly
extreme
of
lake
michigan
was
known.
and
that
true
position
fall
south
of
the
north
cape.
so
that
a
line
drawn
due
east
from
the
true
position
of
the
southerly
extreme
of
lake
michigan
would
not
strike
the
north
cape
at
all
but
would
strike
several
miles
below
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
i
believe
in
1836
congress
knew
the
physical
fact
of
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan
much
better
than
they
had
realized
it
prior
to
that
time.
they
had
taken
into
consideration
many
arguments
from
senators
and
representative
from
both
the
state
of
ohio
and
to
then
territory
of
michigan
and
a
memorial
sent
to
congress
and
to
the
executive
branch,
most
of
this
documentation
is
an
evidence
in
this
proceeding
and
before
the
special
master.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
due
east
line
which
was
striven
for
by
the
territory
or
michigan,
up
until
the
enactment
of
the
1836
legislation,
was
rejected
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
congress
in
so
reject
in
it
recognized
in
effect
the
ohio
proviso
to
the
constitution
of
1802,
and
extended
of
the
boundary
northeast.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
considerably
more
logical
to
believe
that
congress,
in
using
the
term
northeast,
meant
north
45
degrees
east
than
to
conclude
that
they
meant
a
line
which
although
true
it
is
about
2
degrees
10
seconds
north
of
east,
comes
very
close
in
practical
effect
being
due
east
line.
i
think
if
congress
had
meant
to
extend
the
existing
land
boundary
according
to
the
talcott
survey
of
1834,
they
might
well
have
used
the
language
in
the
legislation
appropriate
to
the
purpose,
either
indicating
direct
to
the
international
boundary
line
or
using
phraseology
more
appropriate
to
that
end.
the
turtle
island
which
has
been
referred
to
and
considerably
in
the
briefs
and
arguments
before
the
special
master
and
in
argument
this
morning,
is
a
small
island
located
by
captain
talcott
in
1834
and
its
existence
was
known
prior
to
that
time
at
the
mouth
of
the
maumee
bay.
it
is
located
approximately
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
maumee
bay
and
we
know,
by
reference
to
historical
surveys
and
evidence
in
this
proceeding
that
a
line
drawn
north
45
degrees
east
was
passed
through
the
existing
circular
concrete
seawall
on
turtle
island.
now,
we
have
never
contended
in
the
course
of
this
proceeding
that
the
existence
of
turtle
island
is
determinative
of
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
northeast,
clearly
it
is
not.
it
is
relevant,
however,
if
one
accepts
the
basic
premise
that
northeast
means
north
45
degrees
east.
by
reference
to
historical
survey
as
we
know
that
a
line
drawn
north
45
degrees
east
will
pass
through
that
island.
it
is
then
logical
to
reverse
that
known
col
south
45
degrees
west
until
we
strike
the
projection
of
the
known
and
existing
line
boundary
line
monumented
in
1915.
it
is
at
that
point
in
time
that
both
ohio
and
the
special
master
contend
one
has
relocated
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay
with
about
as
much
practicable
accuracy
as
one
can
hope
for
i
think
when
one
is
trying
to
locate
a
point
which
is
not
been
in
existence
since
well
before
the
middle
of
the
19th
century.
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay,
therefore
under
that
theory,
would
be
readily
ascertained
and
turtle
island
would
serve
as
a
convenient
fixed
boundary
or
monument
readily
seen
by
anyone
sailing
in
and
out
of
maumee
as
a
memorial
or
monument
on
the
boundary
line.
throughout
the
course
of
michigan’s
arguments
both
before
the
special
master
and
in
this
court,
there
has
been
reference
to
the
survey
made
by
captain
andrew
talcott
in
1834.
and
of
course,
michigan’s
basic
position
in
this
litigation
is
that,
that
survey
or
at
least
a
computation
or
an
extension
of
the
line
of
that
survey
through
mathematical
computations
of
its
witness
called
in
this
proceeding,
should
be
extended
in
a
northeasterly
direction
about
2
degrees
north
of
east
to
the
international
boundary
line.
we
would
point
out
that
congress
in
1836
when
it
enacted
the
statute
providing
for
the
admission
of
the
territory
of
michigan
into
the
union
had
before
it
three
basic
surveys.
it
had
before
the
harris
survey
of
1817,
which
was
drawn
in
accordance
with
the
ohio
proviso
and
went
from
the
southerly
extreme
of
lake
michigan
to
the
most
northerly
cape
of
the
maumee
bay.
it
had
before
the
fulton
survey,
which
was
a
due
east
line
drawn
really
at
the
request
of
then
acting
governor
cass
of
the
territory
of
michigan
who
complained
that
the
harris
survey
was
not
drawn
in
accordance
with
then
existing
legislation.
and
the
talcott
survey
in
1834.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
which
indicates
at
all
that
congress
intended
to
extend
the
talcott
line
across
the
lake.
the
very
title
of
the
act
providing
for
the
talcott
survey
is
called
“an
act
preparatory
to
adjust
in
the
northern
boundary
of
the
state
of
ohio.”
and
apparently,
congress
at
least
has
revealed
in
the
michigan
exhibit
8
senate
report
on
the
territories,
felt
that
necessary
in
view
of
the
very
difficult
situation
which
had
developed
between
the
state
and
territory,
and
in
view
the
conflicting
claims
to
have
captain
talcott
ascertain
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
the
points
in
issue
prior
to
further
considering
the
arguments
between
the
state
and
territory
and
coming
to
a
conclusion
on
the
boundary.
it
did
come
to
a
conclusion
on
that
boundary
in
1836
and
that
conclusion
settled
the
issue
in
favor
of
the
state
of
ohio.
and
finally,
as
we
have
indicated,
if
the
position
is
adopted
that
the
legislation
of
1836
was
clear
on
its
face,
then
there
is
no
need
to
refer
to
debates
between
senators
and
congressmen
or
letters
addressed
to
congress
to
construe
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
but
if
this
court
determines
that
indeed,
in
accordance
with
the
claim
of
michigan,
the
statute
is
not
clear
on
its
face
that
there
is
some
ambiguity,
and
if
there
is
then
a
felt
need
to
refer
to
the
documentation
introduced
in
evidenced
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
a
review
of
that
documentation
will
not
support
the
claim
of
michigan.
we
point,
for
example,
to
michigan
exhibit
10
in
evidence
in
this
proceeding
particularly
pages
4
and
6
of
that
exhibit,
which
contain
statements
by
the
then
duly
authorized
representatives
of
the
territory
of
michigan
rejecting
admission
of
their
state
or
their
territory
into
the
union
because
they
could
not
live
with
the
boundary
lines
set
by
congress
in
the
statute,
and
noting
clearly
in
that
particular
documentation
that
michigan
knew
the
import
of
the
congressional
decision.
there
is
reference
in
that
exhibit
to
the
fact
that
ohio,
if
michigan
has
to
accede
to
this
proposition,
will
obtain
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
western
end
of
lake
erie,
almost
to
the
mouth
of
the
detroit
river
and
above
the
river
rouge.
michigan
decries
this,
they
say
it’s
unfair,
they
indicated
this
is
not
in
conformance
with
the
ordinance
of
1787,
they
indicated
this
is
not
in
conformance
with
the
legislation
of
1805
by
virtue
of
which
the
territory
of
michigan
was
formed
out
of
indiana
territory,
but
they
nonetheless
recognize
what
the
meaning
of
the
legislation
is.
and
after
rejecting
congress
proposal
twice,
finally
the
third
time
around
they
agreed
to
this
proposal
with
much
bitterness
in
ranker
as
is
revealed
in
the
debates
feeling
that
the
admission
into
the
union
and
the
advantages
of
the
statehood
outweighed
losing
a
position
for
which
they
had
striven
for
some
25
or
30
years
prior
to
that
time.
we
would
also
note
the
fact
as
it’s
revealed
in
the
documentation
and
evidence
in
this
case
most
of
it
supplied
by
michigan
that
under
a
theory
of
the
due
east
line
extending
from
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
michigan,
the
theory
that
is
contained
in
the
statutes
before
the
exact
position
of
the
southern
extreme
of
lake
michigan
was
known.
and
under
the
maps
and
existence
of
that
time,
ohio
would
have
gotten
almost
all
of
lake
erie.
clearly,
it
seemed
that
congress
had
before
it
maps
of
the
lake
and
there
is
even
references
in
the
documentation
and
evidence
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
ohio
might
have
claimed
more
than
it
chose
to
claim,
had
it
not
inserted
the
proviso
indicating
that
the
boundary
should
be
established
to
the
north
cape
of
the
maumee
bay.
the
reason
they
inserted
that
proviso,
i
believe
both
states
can
agree,
is
because
ohio
at
that
time
was
primarily
concerned
with
preserving
port
city
of
toledo
in
the
mouth
of
the
maumee
bay.
the
debate
between
the
two
states
prior
to
1836
over
what
was
referred
to
as
the
toledo
strip
being
concerned
with
those
points.
we
further
note
the
testimony
which
has
been
referred
to
in
argument
this
afternoon
and
was
discussed
extensively
in
briefing
and
argument
before
the
special
master
that
is
the
testimony
of
the
geodetic
engineer
of
the
university
of
michigan
called
on
behalf
of
michigan.
we
indicated
at
the
time
to
the
special
master
and
reiterate
our
position
this
afternoon
that
although
the
state
of
ohio
has
no
evidence
rebutting
the
mathematical
calculations
of
professor
berry
as
he
extends
the
talcott
line
across
the
lake
to
the
international
boundary
line,
we
consider
this
calculations
totally
irrelevant
if
this
court
believes
that
the
true
boundary,
as
revealed
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
north
45
degrees
east.
much
of
the
testimony
concerns
the
professor’s
opinion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
historical
documents
and
his
ultimate
conclusion
of
law
on
this
case,
we
consider
it
not
relevant
if
the
court
initially
holds
that
the
line
is
due
northeast.
and
finally
we
would
refer
the
court's
attention
to
the
other
exhibits
offered
by
ohio,
the
resolution
of
the
ohio
general
assembly
in
1933
defining
the
boundary
as
we
have
contended
it
to
be
today.
the
michigan
rescission
resolution
of
1945
in
which
they
agreed
with
the
state
of
ohio.
true
they
rescinded
that
resolution
two
years
later,
but
it
indicates
at
least
to
us
that
highly-placed
officials
of
the
state
of
michigan
at
that
point
in
time
were
aware
of
where
the
boundary
lay
and
agreed
with
ohio.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
yes,
the
ohio
general
assembly
passed
their
resolution
in
1933.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
yes,
specifically
stated
in
the
1933
resolution
as
the
hope
that
michigan
would
pass
a
like
resolution.
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
they
did
in
1945
identical
to
that
of
ohio.
they
rescinded
that
resolution
on
1947
two
years
later.
and
that
is
where
the
matter
lay
until
--
mr.
charles
s.
rawlings
--
the
filing
of
this
litigation.
we
would
also
refer
the
court’s
attention
respectfully
to
the
two
other
exhibits
submitted
by
ohio,
the
maps
of
the
erie
and
oregon
quadrangle
compiled
by
the
geodetic
service.
both
of
those
maps
show
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states
as
being
north
45
degrees
east
from
a
point
located
as
north
cape,
and
notations
at
the
top
of
those
exhibits
indicate
that
the
exhibits
were
prepared
in
collaboration
with
the
commissioner
of
highways
of
state
of
michigan.
in
summary,
therefore,
we
would
respectfully
urged
this
court
to
confirm
the
findings
and
the
conclusions
issued
by
judge
maris,
the
special
master
in
this
case,
and
to
enter
a
decree
in
this
matter
in
conformance
with
the
findings
and
conclusions,
and
recommend
the
decree
of
the
special
master.
