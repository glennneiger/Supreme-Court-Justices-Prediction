mr.
peter
westen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
leon
chambers
was
convicted
of
a
murder
which
another
man
was
seen
committing
and
towards
that
other
man
spontaneously
and
repeatedly
confessed
within
hours
of
the
shooting.
the
case
presents
two
questions.
first,
whether
chambers
has
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
introduce
the
other
man's
confessions
to
prove
he
is
innocent
and
second,
whether
chambers
has
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
cross-examine
the
other
man
and
to
impeach
him
for
repudiating
his
confession
in
court
and
denying
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
crime.
the
case
began
with
a
shooting
that
it
took
place
at
night
during
a
racial
disturbance
in
june,
1969
in
the
town
of
woodville,
mississippi.
the
victim
was
a
policeman
named
aaron
liberty.
liberty
and
other
policemen
were
confronting
an
angry
crowd
of
about
50
blacks.
as
liberty
faced
the
crowd,
he
was
suddenly
shot
four
times
in
the
back.
the
bullets
came
from
a
22-caliber
gun
from
somewhere
in
the
alley
behind
him.
as
he
died,
he
turned
and
shot
both
barrels
of
his
riot
gun
into
the
alley.
the
first
shot
passed
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd,
the
second
shot
hit
a
man,
who
by
then
was
running
down
the
alley.
that
man
was
the
petitioner,
leon
chambers.
chambers
was
left
in
the
alley
severely
wounded.
when
the
police
had
gone,
he
was
taken
to
a
local
hospital
where
two
days
later,
he
was
placed
under-arrest
for
the
murder
of
aaron
liberty.
chambers
insisted
from
the
outset
that
he
was
innocent
and
that
the
state
had
arrested
the
wrong
man.
indeed,
within
hours
of
shooting,
another
man
gable
mcdonald
spontaneously
confessed
on
separate
occasions
to
three
different
people
that
he
was
the
one
who
shot
officer
liberty.
he
first
confessed
to
berkley
turner,
who
left
the
scene
of
the
shooting
with
him,
that
night.
he
next
confessed
to
sam
hardin
who
he
had
known
all
of
his
life
and
who
drove
him
home
on
the
night
of
the
shooting.
he
confessed
the
next
day
to
albert
carter,
his
next
door
neighbor
whom
he
had
known
for
at
least
25
years.
four
months
later,
mcdonald
repeated
his
confession.
he
dictated
it
in
the
presence
of
a
minister
and
signed
it
under
oath,
it
was
detailed.
he
said
that
he
shot
officer
liberty
at
close
range
from
the
mouth
of
the
alley.
he
said
that
he
used
his
own
nine-shot
22-caliber
pistol
which
he
discarded
after
the
shooting.
he
said
that
he
was
confessing
because
it
was
no
secret
any
longer
that
he
was
the
one
that
shot
liberty.
he
said
that
he
was
telling
the
truth,
but
admitted
that
he
would
be
afraid
to
testify
in
court.
mr.
peter
westen
gable
mcdonald
had
a
preliminary
hearing,
one
month
after
he
signed
his
written
confession
for
justice
of
the
peace
who
after
a
few
days
of
deliberation,
dismissed
the
charges
against
him.
one
year
later,
chambers
himself
went
to
trial
for
the
murder
of
aaron
liberty.
he
based
this
defense
on
showing
that
he
was
innocent
and
that
it
was
not
he
but
mcdonald
who
killed
liberty.
the
evidence
against
chambers
is
practically
nonexistent.
one
witness
testified
that
he
was
watching
chambers
at
the
time
of
the
shooting,
and
could
swear
that
chambers
did
not
shoot
liberty.
three
policemen
who
were
on
the
scene;
one
who
was
standing
only
two
yards
from
chambers
and
another
who
was
standing
four
yards
from
chambers
and
watching
him
at
the
time,
denied
seeing
chambers
shoot
liberty.
the
police
testified
also
that
despite
diligence
search,
they
never
found
the
murder
weapon.
there
was
evidence
also
in
the
record
of
the
chamber
--
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
chambers
had
ever
owned
a
22-caliber
gun.
it
is
true
that
one
witness,
a
policeman,
the
one
who
was
standing
farthest
from
chambers,
testified
that
he
saw
chamber
shoot
liberty.
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
the
record
showed
that
he
had
purchased
before
the
shooting
a
9-shot
.22-caliber
pistol
and
that
he
purchased
shortly
after
the
shooting,
a
second
.22
caliber
pistol.
mr.
peter
westen
that
was
offered
as
part
of
the
defendant's
affirmative
case.
the
defendant
called
a
witness
who
sold
the
two
guns
to
gable
mcdonald
in
natchez,
mississippi
and
we
had
federal
fire
arms
records.
i
was
saying
that
there
was
one
eyewitness,
a
policeman
who
testified
that
he
saw
chamber
shoot
liberty.
but,
the
record
also
shows
that
neither
that
policeman
nor
any
other
policeman
even
searched
chambers
who
was
lying
at
the
most
20-25
feet
from
them
after
he
was
shot
and
that,
that
same
policeman
spent
the
next
day
asking
members
of
the
black
community
if
they
knew
who
shot
liberty.
as
for
chamber's
affirmative
case,
which
is
the
issue
here,
he
moved
first
to
introduce
mcdonald's
oral
confessions.
the
confession
was
spontaneous,
they
were
independent
of
one
another.
they
were
uttered
on
the
scene
of
the
--
they
were
uttered
within
hours
of
the
shooting.
they
were
made
to
friends
of
his
and
the
people
who
had
themselves
witnessed
the
shooting.
furthermore,
the
confessions
were
corroborated
by
eye-witness
testimony.
one
witness
testified
that
he
saw
mcdonald
shoot
liberty,
another
testified
that
he
saw
mcdonald
immediately
after
the
shooting
carrying
a
pistol.
as
i
said
before,
there
was
evidence
that
mcdonald
had
owned
two
.22
caliber
pistols.
one
that
he
had
purchased
before
the
shooting
and
another
that
he
had
purchased
immediately
thereafter.
nonetheless,
when
chambers
called
sam
hardin
and
berkley
turner
as
defense
witnesses,
the
trial
court
excluded,
prevented
them
from
discussing
mcdonald's
confessions.
he
excluded
the
confessions
on
the
ground
that
declarations
against
penal
interest
are
hearsay
and
inadmissible
in
mississippi.
chambers
then
moved
to
introduce
mcdonald's
written
confession.
for
that
purpose,
he
called
mcdonald
as
a
defense
witness.
he
had
no
illusions
at
that
point
that
mcdonald
would
be
a
friendly
witness,
because
of
mcdonald's
own
preliminary
hearing
long
before
the
trial,
mcdonald
had
repudiated
his
confession.
but
chambers
called
him
for
the
purpose
of
authenticating
the
confession
and
laying
a
basis
for
introducing
it
and
he
examined
mcdonald
for
that
purpose
only.
when
--
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
it
was.
it
was
--
mr.
peter
westen
it
was
introduced--
mr.
peter
westen
i
think
if
the
state
hadn't
made
a
hearsay
objection,
it
would
have
probably
been
sustained,
but
they
did
not
and
hearsay
is
only
excluded
on
motion,
on
objection
in
mississippi.
it
may
well
have
been
--
mr.
peter
westen
the
state
interrogated
him
about
the
truth
of
his
confession,
but
chambers
was
denied
the
right
to
cross-examine
him
following
the
state's
examination
about
his
repudiation.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right.
mr.
peter
westen
he
knew
at
that
point.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right,
and
the
state
made
no
objection.
it
may
have
been
that
the
written
confession
had
already
been
introduced
in
mcdonald's
own
preliminary
hearing,
whether
that
was
the
reason
or
whether
the
state
failed
to
make
the
objection
for
other
reasons,
it
was
directed
to
jury.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right.
mr.
peter
westen
yes.
mr.
peter
westen
he
might
have
asked
that
question,
but
he
had
very
good
reasons
for
not
asking
it.
he
made
a
motion
before
trial
to
examine
mcdonald
--
mr.
peter
westen
certainly
and
i
think
if
he
had
asked
that
question,
it
would
have
been
admitted
but
there
were
reasons.
mr.
peter
westen
he
might
--
but
he
most
likely
would
have
denied
it
for
these
reasons.
mr.
peter
westen
if
he
had
denied
it,
which
is
what
chambers
expected
because
mcdonalds
on
preliminary
hearing,
he
had
already
denied
talking
to
anyone
else
about
the
shooting
or
having
confessed
to
anyone
else
before
his
written
confession.
if
he
had
denied
it,
chambers
would
have
been
left
with
an
answer
that
he
couldn't
impeach
and
could
not
follow
up
because
the
trial
court
had
already
ruled
that
--
mr.
peter
westen
that's
a
question
perhaps
a
trial
strategy
--
mr.
peter
westen
but,
i
think
it
would
have
been
madness
to
ask
a
witness
for
an
answer
that
could
not
be
impeached.
chambers
called
mcdonald
because
there
was
certain
testimony
he
wanted
from
him
and
he
examined
him
for
that
purpose
only
and
until
the
court
permitted
him
to
pursue
inquiry
fully,
he
refused
to
elicit
answers
that
he
could
not
follow
up.
mr.
peter
westen
there
are
two
answers
of
that.
redirect
makes
some
sense
where
there
is
a
hope
of
rehabilitating
a
witness,
where
the
witness
is
friendly,
where
he
is
prepared
to
support
the
party
who
called
him.
but
in
this
case,
mcdonald
had
denied
on
cross-examination
everything
he
had
said
on
direct
examination,
he
repudiated
it,
and
the
only
thing
--
and
there
is
almost
nothing
that
can
be
done
on
redirect
with
the
witness
like
that.
the
reason
why
chambers
did
not
go
ahead
and
asked
individual
questions
on
cross-examination,
but
ask
him
about
his
explanation
for
repudiating
the
confession
and
what
he
was
really
doing
that
night
and
about
the
truth
of
his
alibi
and
about
his
22-caliber
pistol
is
that
the
judge
had
ruled,
and
made
a
ruling
that
he
had
no
right
to
put
a
leading
questions
to
his
witness.
mr.
peter
westen
he
would
have
been,
and
that
is
what
he
had
been
told
from
the
outset
of
trial.
mr.
peter
westen
that
is
our
answer.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
what
was
argued
in
the
state
court.
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
as
far
as
the
constitutional
question
is
concerned,
mcdonald
became
a
witness
against
chambers
when
he
denied
the
truth
of
the
facts
on
which
chambers
rested
his
defense.
it
was
at
that
point
that
chambers
we
submit
had
a
constitutional
right
to
cross-examine
him,
to
probe
the
truth
of
his
testimony,
to
determine
if
he
was
committing
perjury,
and
to
impeach
him
with
independent
evidence
to
show
--
to
discredit
his
testimony.
mr.
peter
westen
no,
he
was
not,
and
i
should
say
that
at
the
point
where
the
justice
of
the
peace
dismissed
charges
against
mcdonald,
the
only
evidence
they
had
against
mcdonald
was
his
sworn
confession.
they
did
not
know
about
the
three
oral
confessions,
and
they
did
not
know
about
the
eye-witness.
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
he
was.
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
he
did.
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
conviction
on
two
independent
grounds.
first,
chambers
was
denied
his
right
under
the
constitution
to
call
hardin
and
turner
as
witnesses
in
his
behalf,
and
to
introduce
mcdonald's
confessions
to
prove
he
was
innocent.
the
right
to
call
witnesses,
the
right
of
the
accused
to
call
witnesses
and
present
testimony
is
protected
by
both
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
compulsory
process
clause
as
the
sixth
amendment.
with
respect
to
due
process,
we
rely
on
a
line
of
cases
of
which
the
leading
case
is
brady
versus
maryland.
brady
stands
for
the
general
proposition
that
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
for
the
stake,
for
no
good
reason
to
deprive
a
defendant
of
exculpatory
evidence
that
has
a
material
bearing
on
his
innocence.
in
brady,
the
state
deprived
the
defendant
of
exculpatory
evidence
by
withholding
it
from
him.
in
this
case,
mississippi
has
denied
chambers
the
benefit
of
exculpatory
confessions
by
withholding
them
from
the
jury.
the
effect
in
each
case
is
the
same.
in
each
case,
the
state
put
a
man
on
trial
for
his
life,
and
then
for
no
good
reason,
deprived
him
of
the
benefit
of
evidence
that
would
have
shown
he
was
innocent.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right,
that's
--
mr.
peter
westen
that
is
our
position,
but
i
should
expand
on
it.
it's
our
position
that
due
process
and
compulsory
process
entitled
the
accused
to
offer
evidence
to
show
he
is
innocent,
unless
the
state
can
show
some
reason
for
withholding
it
from
the
jury
and
in
this
--
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right.
mr.
peter
westen
we
submit
that
we
should
have
been
permitted
to
put
on
the
stand
sam
hardin
and
berkley
turner
to
testify
--
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right,
to
recite
mcdonald's
out-of-court
confessions.
mr.
peter
westen
no,
because
we
think
that,
that's
one
reason
why
mississippi
is
incapable
in
this
case
of
making
a
showing
--
of
showing
a
reason
for
withholding
the
confession,
the
presence
of
mcdonald,
renders
his
out-of-court
confession,
sufficiently
reliable.
it
provided
a
sufficient
basis
for
introducing
his
hearsay
confession
that
there
was
no
legitimate
reason
to
keep
it
out.
there
is
another
reason.
we
think
that
--
mr.
peter
westen
we
do
not
think
that
court
has
to
overrule
donnelly.
donnelly
was
not
a
constitutional
case.
it
established
a
federal
hearsay
rule,
and
it
did
so
on
facts
that
were
not
nearly
as
compelling
as
they
are
in
this
case.
in
donnelly,
the
declarant
was
dead
and
there
was
no
way
to
cross-examine
him
about
the
truth
of
his
out-of-court
statement.
in
addition,
there
was
only
one
confession
as
opposed
to
three
as
in
this
case
and
finally,
there
was
eyewitness
testimony
in
this
case
to
corroborate
the
hearsay
confession
which
is
not
the
case
in
donnelly.
mr.
peter
westen
i
think
that
--
and
that
relates
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
and
i
think
that
kind
of
rule
would
make
a
lot
of
sense.
that's
the
proposed
federal
rule,
that's
the
rule
in
california,
but
mississippi
does
not
have
that
rule.
it
excludes
hearsay
confessions
whether
or
not
there
is
a
predicate,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
priors
question
to
the
witness
to
about
whether
he
made
the
out-of-court
statement.
it
is
our
position
that
it
would
have
served
no
purpose
to
ask,
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
mcdonald's
out-of-court
confessions
for
that
truth
as
hearsay,
the
prove
chambers
was
innocent,
there
was
no
purpose
served
by
asking
mcdonald
in
mississippi.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right,
there
are
two
arguments
we
made.
the
first
is
the
chambers
had
an
affirmative
right
to
show
he
was
innocent,
by
offering
evidence
and
--
mr.
peter
westen
that
it
was
not
he
but
someone
else
who
committed
the
crime.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
california
versus
green
and
in
dutton
versus
evans,
there
is
no
legitimate
ground
fro
withholding
those
hearsay
confessions
to
exculpate
chambers.
in
dutton
versus
evans,
the
court
--
in
dutton
versus
evans,
the
court
--
mr.
peter
westen
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
westen
we
think
that
california
versus
green,
and
dutton
versus
evans
are
cumulative
in
this
case.
both
factors
are
present
--
under
the
standard
in
california
versus
green,
the
declarant
was
present,
under
the
standard
in
dutton
versus
evans,
the
statement
was
a
spontaneous
declaration
against
penal
interest.
it
carries
the
language
of
plurality
opinion
such
indicia
of
reliability,
that
they
can
be
introduced
in
satisfaction
of
the
strict
constitutional
standard
of
the
confrontation
clause.
in
this
case
--
mr.
peter
westen
in
many
ways
we
are
--
in
some
ways,
perhaps
it's
the
converse
of
dutton
and
of
california
versus
green,
but
for
this
reason.
in
california
versus
green
and
in
dutton,
the
state
offered
hearsay
against
the
accused
under
its
own
rules
of
evidence,
and
the
question
was
were
those
hearsay
statements,
so
inherently
reliable
in
their
context
that
they
could
be
introduced
in
satisfaction
of
the
strict
constitutional
standard
of
the
confrontation
clause.
in
this
case,
chambers
contends
that
he
has
a
right
under
the
compulsory
process
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
confrontation,
and
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
offer
the
evidence
in
his
favor
affirmatively
to
prove
his
innocent,
unless
the
state
can
demonstrate,
that
the
hearsay
is
so
inherently
unreliable
that
the
only
way
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
courtroom
is
to
exclude
it
all
together.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
federal
standard,
and
i
should
say
that
whether
or
not
the
hearsay
is
reliable,
is
itself
a
federal
question.
and
it
is
a
federal
question
because
it
determines
the
scope
of
the
defendants'
right
to
prove
he
is
innocent.
and
in
light
of
california
versus
green
and
dutton
versus
evans,
i
see
no
way
in
which
mississippi
can
demonstrate
that
these
statements
are
so
unreliable
that
they
have
to
be
kept
out
to
preserve
integrity
of
the
courtroom.
mr.
peter
westen
it
is
my
feeling
that
where
a
hearsay
statement
is
corroborated
by
an
eyewitness,
and
is
corroborated
by
the
declarance
on
written
confession,
and
corroborated
by
independent
oral
confessions,
and
is
a
declaration
against
penal
interest,
and
is
spontaneous
and
other
than
on
the
scene
at
the
crime,
defense
of
the
declarant,
that
it
is
sufficiently
reliable
to
be
introduced
in
his
favor.
but,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
because
the
declarant
was
present
here.
i
think
it
is
important--
mr.
peter
westen
well,
perhaps
i
have
mislead
you
mr.
justice
powell.
it's
my
position
that
the
due
process
clause
and
the
compulsory
process
clause
entitle
the
accused
to
offer
any
exculpatory
evidence,
that
has
a
material
bearing
on
his
innocence
unless
the
state
comes
forward
and
makes
it
showing
that
the
evidence
is
so
unreliable
that
it
has
to
be
kept
out.
so
it
is
not
the
accused
to
have
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
reliable,
it
is
the
state
that
has
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
inherently
unreliable.
mr.
peter
westen
there
is
a
hearsay
rule
and
there
is
a
state
and
--
mr.
peter
westen
that
is
the
rule
that
perhaps
--
mr.
peter
westen
the
rule
in
federal
courts
which
has
been
established
in
donnelly
versus
united
states
to
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred,
establishes
that
standard,
that
establishes
that
proposition
--
mr.
peter
westen
and
the
states
are
generally
in
agreement
with
donnelly
about
that
but
i
--
mr.
peter
westen
it's
our
position
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
a
persuasive
reason
for
preventing
the
accused
from
proving
he
is
innocent.
as
per
the
hearsay
rule
as
you
would
referring
to
mr.
justice
white,
donnelly
itself
has
been
severely
questioned.
it
would
be
abolished
by
the
new
proposed
federal
rule
of
evidence,
the
dissent
by
mr.
justice
holmes
is
slowly
becoming
the
prevailing
position
in
all
of
recent
states
that
have
recently
codified
their
laws
of
evidence.
but
we
are
not
making
the
argument
as
a
general
matter
that
declarations
against
penal
interest
should
always
be
admissible.
we're
making
the
--
it's
our
possession
that
in
a
criminal
case,
where
there
is
practically
no
evidence
against
the
accused,
and
where
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
is
being
tried
for
a
crime
to
which
someone
else
committed,
and
he
has
--
mr.
peter
westen
if
this
were
a
case
like
dutton
versus
evans
in
which
there
were
19
witnesses
against
the
accused
who
all
pointed
the
finger
at
him,
there
might
be
some
question
about
whether
he
could
offer
a
heresy
confession
to
prove
that
he
didn't
do
it.
mr.
peter
westen
i
am
not
sure
that
i
know
what
you
mean
by
totality.
i
think
the
question
is,
is
the
statement
exculpatory,
is
it
material?
mr.
peter
westen
well,
the
general
propositions
on
which
we
rest
our
argument
is
that
accused
does
have
an
affirmative
right
to
prove
he
is
innocent
unless
the
state
can
make
some
showing
and
that's
in
this
case,
it
is
we
submit
absolutely
untenable
to
argue
that
out
of
court
statements
confessions
are
unreliable.
mr.
peter
westen
oh,
that's
right.
the
constitutional
basis
is
--
i
refer
the
court
to
the
opinion
on
the
last
day
of
the
term
in
june
and
the
case
holding
that
parolees
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
they
are
--
before
their
parole
is
revoked.
the
court
said
in
that
opinion,
that
the
due
process
entitles
an
accused
to
offer
evidence
to
show
he
is
innocent
and
to
confront
the
witness
is
against
him.
that's
our
position,
that
there
is
an
affirmative
right
to
an
accused
to
make
out
a
defense,
and
to
offer
evidence
that
is
reliable
and
persuasive,
and
material
to
his
innocence,
and
as
our
second
ground
which
i
haven't
discussed
yet
and
probably
won't
reach,
that
the
accused
has
a
right
to
confront
and
impeach,
cross-examine
witnesses
against
him.
mr.
peter
westen
--and
when
he
denied
the
truth
of
chamber's
affirmative
defense.
perhaps
i'll
reserve
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
westen
i
will
refer
the
court
to
our
reply
brief
and
all
of
these
questions
concerning
the
failure
to
ask
a
question
and
the
failure
to
lay
a
foundation,
but
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
it
to
mr.
rehnquist,
and
mr.
justice
white.
chambers
offered
confessions
for
two
different
purposes.
first,
as
affirmative
evidence
of
his
own
innocence.
for
that
purpose,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
proper
foundation
in
mississippi.
there
is
no
rule
in
mississippi
that
to
offer
hearsay
for
its
truth,
you
have
to
first
ask
the
witness,
that
the
witness
understand
whether
or
not
he
made
the
out
of
court
statement
.that
might
be
a
good
rule.
it
is
a
rule
in
california,
it
is
not
the
rule
in
mississippi.
as
for
the
--
we
have
offered
a
confession
for
an
entirely
different
purpose,
an
opposite
purpose.
we
offered
the
confession
to
albert
carter
in
order
to
impeach
gable
mcdonald.
in
order
to
lay
the
foundation
for
an
impeaching
confession,
it
is
necessary
to
ask
the
witness
whether
or
not
he
made
the
out
of
court
statement.
but,
we
were
not
able
to
do
that
at
the
trial
court,
because
at
that
point
in
time,
the
trial
court
had
ruled
that
we
could
not
cross-examine
mcdonald,
and
the
question
put
to
mcdonald
whether
or
not
he
had
made
an
out
of
court
confession,
inconsistent
with
what
he
had
just
testified
to,
to
the
state
would
have
been
in
the
nature
of
cross-examination.
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
and
for
the
above
reasons,
for
the
reasons
that
chambers
was
unable
to
offer
a
hearsay
confession
to
prove
he
was
innocent,
and
to
cross-examine
mcdonald.
mr.
peter
westen
no,
but
i
think
it's
implied
because
the
above
grounds
are
the
errors
that
--
are
the
specific
errors
alleged.
the
argument
was
raise
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court
specifically
even
if
it
had
not
been,
it
would
have
been
before
that
court
properly
under
the
mississippi
plain
error,
but
it
was
raised.
mr.
peter
westen
i
think
that
is
right,
but
that
is
because
they
did
not
bother
with
them.
the
questions
were
properly
before
them,
they
were
passed
upon
necessarily,
and
they
were
implicitly
denied.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
westen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
leon
chambers
was
convicted
of
a
murder
which
another
man
was
seen
committing
and
towards
that
other
man
spontaneously
and
repeatedly
confessed
within
hours
of
the
shooting.
the
case
presents
two
questions.
first,
whether
chambers
has
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
introduce
the
other
man's
confessions
to
prove
he
is
innocent
and
second,
whether
chambers
has
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
cross-examine
the
other
man
and
to
impeach
him
for
repudiating
his
confession
in
court
and
denying
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
crime.
the
case
began
with
a
shooting
that
it
took
place
at
night
during
a
racial
disturbance
in
june,
1969
in
the
town
of
woodville,
mississippi.
the
victim
was
a
policeman
named
aaron
liberty.
liberty
and
other
policemen
were
confronting
an
angry
crowd
of
about
50
blacks.
as
liberty
faced
the
crowd,
he
was
suddenly
shot
four
times
in
the
back.
the
bullets
came
from
a
22-caliber
gun
from
somewhere
in
the
alley
behind
him.
as
he
died,
he
turned
and
shot
both
barrels
of
his
riot
gun
into
the
alley.
the
first
shot
passed
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd,
the
second
shot
hit
a
man,
who
by
then
was
running
down
the
alley.
that
man
was
the
petitioner,
leon
chambers.
chambers
was
left
in
the
alley
severely
wounded.
when
the
police
had
gone,
he
was
taken
to
a
local
hospital
where
two
days
later,
he
was
placed
under-arrest
for
the
murder
of
aaron
liberty.
chambers
insisted
from
the
outset
that
he
was
innocent
and
that
the
state
had
arrested
the
wrong
man.
indeed,
within
hours
of
shooting,
another
man
gable
mcdonald
spontaneously
confessed
on
separate
occasions
to
three
different
people
that
he
was
the
one
who
shot
officer
liberty.
he
first
confessed
to
berkley
turner,
who
left
the
scene
of
the
shooting
with
him,
that
night.
he
next
confessed
to
sam
hardin
who
he
had
known
all
of
his
life
and
who
drove
him
home
on
the
night
of
the
shooting.
he
confessed
the
next
day
to
albert
carter,
his
next
door
neighbor
whom
he
had
known
for
at
least
25
years.
four
months
later,
mcdonald
repeated
his
confession.
he
dictated
it
in
the
presence
of
a
minister
and
signed
it
under
oath,
it
was
detailed.
he
said
that
he
shot
officer
liberty
at
close
range
from
the
mouth
of
the
alley.
he
said
that
he
used
his
own
nine-shot
22-caliber
pistol
which
he
discarded
after
the
shooting.
he
said
that
he
was
confessing
because
it
was
no
secret
any
longer
that
he
was
the
one
that
shot
liberty.
he
said
that
he
was
telling
the
truth,
but
admitted
that
he
would
be
afraid
to
testify
in
court.
mr.
peter
westen
gable
mcdonald
had
a
preliminary
hearing,
one
month
after
he
signed
his
written
confession
for
justice
of
the
peace
who
after
a
few
days
of
deliberation,
dismissed
the
charges
against
him.
one
year
later,
chambers
himself
went
to
trial
for
the
murder
of
aaron
liberty.
he
based
this
defense
on
showing
that
he
was
innocent
and
that
it
was
not
he
but
mcdonald
who
killed
liberty.
the
evidence
against
chambers
is
practically
nonexistent.
one
witness
testified
that
he
was
watching
chambers
at
the
time
of
the
shooting,
and
could
swear
that
chambers
did
not
shoot
liberty.
three
policemen
who
were
on
the
scene;
one
who
was
standing
only
two
yards
from
chambers
and
another
who
was
standing
four
yards
from
chambers
and
watching
him
at
the
time,
denied
seeing
chambers
shoot
liberty.
the
police
testified
also
that
despite
diligence
search,
they
never
found
the
murder
weapon.
there
was
evidence
also
in
the
record
of
the
chamber
--
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
chambers
had
ever
owned
a
22-caliber
gun.
it
is
true
that
one
witness,
a
policeman,
the
one
who
was
standing
farthest
from
chambers,
testified
that
he
saw
chamber
shoot
liberty.
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
the
record
showed
that
he
had
purchased
before
the
shooting
a
9-shot
.22-caliber
pistol
and
that
he
purchased
shortly
after
the
shooting,
a
second
.22
caliber
pistol.
mr.
peter
westen
that
was
offered
as
part
of
the
defendant's
affirmative
case.
the
defendant
called
a
witness
who
sold
the
two
guns
to
gable
mcdonald
in
natchez,
mississippi
and
we
had
federal
fire
arms
records.
i
was
saying
that
there
was
one
eyewitness,
a
policeman
who
testified
that
he
saw
chamber
shoot
liberty.
but,
the
record
also
shows
that
neither
that
policeman
nor
any
other
policeman
even
searched
chambers
who
was
lying
at
the
most
20-25
feet
from
them
after
he
was
shot
and
that,
that
same
policeman
spent
the
next
day
asking
members
of
the
black
community
if
they
knew
who
shot
liberty.
as
for
chamber's
affirmative
case,
which
is
the
issue
here,
he
moved
first
to
introduce
mcdonald's
oral
confessions.
the
confession
was
spontaneous,
they
were
independent
of
one
another.
they
were
uttered
on
the
scene
of
the
--
they
were
uttered
within
hours
of
the
shooting.
they
were
made
to
friends
of
his
and
the
people
who
had
themselves
witnessed
the
shooting.
furthermore,
the
confessions
were
corroborated
by
eye-witness
testimony.
one
witness
testified
that
he
saw
mcdonald
shoot
liberty,
another
testified
that
he
saw
mcdonald
immediately
after
the
shooting
carrying
a
pistol.
as
i
said
before,
there
was
evidence
that
mcdonald
had
owned
two
.22
caliber
pistols.
one
that
he
had
purchased
before
the
shooting
and
another
that
he
had
purchased
immediately
thereafter.
nonetheless,
when
chambers
called
sam
hardin
and
berkley
turner
as
defense
witnesses,
the
trial
court
excluded,
prevented
them
from
discussing
mcdonald's
confessions.
he
excluded
the
confessions
on
the
ground
that
declarations
against
penal
interest
are
hearsay
and
inadmissible
in
mississippi.
chambers
then
moved
to
introduce
mcdonald's
written
confession.
for
that
purpose,
he
called
mcdonald
as
a
defense
witness.
he
had
no
illusions
at
that
point
that
mcdonald
would
be
a
friendly
witness,
because
of
mcdonald's
own
preliminary
hearing
long
before
the
trial,
mcdonald
had
repudiated
his
confession.
but
chambers
called
him
for
the
purpose
of
authenticating
the
confession
and
laying
a
basis
for
introducing
it
and
he
examined
mcdonald
for
that
purpose
only.
when
--
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
it
was.
it
was
--
mr.
peter
westen
it
was
introduced--
mr.
peter
westen
i
think
if
the
state
hadn't
made
a
hearsay
objection,
it
would
have
probably
been
sustained,
but
they
did
not
and
hearsay
is
only
excluded
on
motion,
on
objection
in
mississippi.
it
may
well
have
been
--
mr.
peter
westen
the
state
interrogated
him
about
the
truth
of
his
confession,
but
chambers
was
denied
the
right
to
cross-examine
him
following
the
state's
examination
about
his
repudiation.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right.
mr.
peter
westen
he
knew
at
that
point.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right,
and
the
state
made
no
objection.
it
may
have
been
that
the
written
confession
had
already
been
introduced
in
mcdonald's
own
preliminary
hearing,
whether
that
was
the
reason
or
whether
the
state
failed
to
make
the
objection
for
other
reasons,
it
was
directed
to
jury.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right.
mr.
peter
westen
yes.
mr.
peter
westen
he
might
have
asked
that
question,
but
he
had
very
good
reasons
for
not
asking
it.
he
made
a
motion
before
trial
to
examine
mcdonald
--
mr.
peter
westen
certainly
and
i
think
if
he
had
asked
that
question,
it
would
have
been
admitted
but
there
were
reasons.
mr.
peter
westen
he
might
--
but
he
most
likely
would
have
denied
it
for
these
reasons.
mr.
peter
westen
if
he
had
denied
it,
which
is
what
chambers
expected
because
mcdonalds
on
preliminary
hearing,
he
had
already
denied
talking
to
anyone
else
about
the
shooting
or
having
confessed
to
anyone
else
before
his
written
confession.
if
he
had
denied
it,
chambers
would
have
been
left
with
an
answer
that
he
couldn't
impeach
and
could
not
follow
up
because
the
trial
court
had
already
ruled
that
--
mr.
peter
westen
that's
a
question
perhaps
a
trial
strategy
--
mr.
peter
westen
but,
i
think
it
would
have
been
madness
to
ask
a
witness
for
an
answer
that
could
not
be
impeached.
chambers
called
mcdonald
because
there
was
certain
testimony
he
wanted
from
him
and
he
examined
him
for
that
purpose
only
and
until
the
court
permitted
him
to
pursue
inquiry
fully,
he
refused
to
elicit
answers
that
he
could
not
follow
up.
mr.
peter
westen
there
are
two
answers
of
that.
redirect
makes
some
sense
where
there
is
a
hope
of
rehabilitating
a
witness,
where
the
witness
is
friendly,
where
he
is
prepared
to
support
the
party
who
called
him.
but
in
this
case,
mcdonald
had
denied
on
cross-examination
everything
he
had
said
on
direct
examination,
he
repudiated
it,
and
the
only
thing
--
and
there
is
almost
nothing
that
can
be
done
on
redirect
with
the
witness
like
that.
the
reason
why
chambers
did
not
go
ahead
and
asked
individual
questions
on
cross-examination,
but
ask
him
about
his
explanation
for
repudiating
the
confession
and
what
he
was
really
doing
that
night
and
about
the
truth
of
his
alibi
and
about
his
22-caliber
pistol
is
that
the
judge
had
ruled,
and
made
a
ruling
that
he
had
no
right
to
put
a
leading
questions
to
his
witness.
mr.
peter
westen
he
would
have
been,
and
that
is
what
he
had
been
told
from
the
outset
of
trial.
mr.
peter
westen
that
is
our
answer.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
what
was
argued
in
the
state
court.
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
as
far
as
the
constitutional
question
is
concerned,
mcdonald
became
a
witness
against
chambers
when
he
denied
the
truth
of
the
facts
on
which
chambers
rested
his
defense.
it
was
at
that
point
that
chambers
we
submit
had
a
constitutional
right
to
cross-examine
him,
to
probe
the
truth
of
his
testimony,
to
determine
if
he
was
committing
perjury,
and
to
impeach
him
with
independent
evidence
to
show
--
to
discredit
his
testimony.
mr.
peter
westen
no,
he
was
not,
and
i
should
say
that
at
the
point
where
the
justice
of
the
peace
dismissed
charges
against
mcdonald,
the
only
evidence
they
had
against
mcdonald
was
his
sworn
confession.
they
did
not
know
about
the
three
oral
confessions,
and
they
did
not
know
about
the
eye-witness.
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
he
was.
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
he
did.
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
conviction
on
two
independent
grounds.
first,
chambers
was
denied
his
right
under
the
constitution
to
call
hardin
and
turner
as
witnesses
in
his
behalf,
and
to
introduce
mcdonald's
confessions
to
prove
he
was
innocent.
the
right
to
call
witnesses,
the
right
of
the
accused
to
call
witnesses
and
present
testimony
is
protected
by
both
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
compulsory
process
clause
as
the
sixth
amendment.
with
respect
to
due
process,
we
rely
on
a
line
of
cases
of
which
the
leading
case
is
brady
versus
maryland.
brady
stands
for
the
general
proposition
that
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
for
the
stake,
for
no
good
reason
to
deprive
a
defendant
of
exculpatory
evidence
that
has
a
material
bearing
on
his
innocence.
in
brady,
the
state
deprived
the
defendant
of
exculpatory
evidence
by
withholding
it
from
him.
in
this
case,
mississippi
has
denied
chambers
the
benefit
of
exculpatory
confessions
by
withholding
them
from
the
jury.
the
effect
in
each
case
is
the
same.
in
each
case,
the
state
put
a
man
on
trial
for
his
life,
and
then
for
no
good
reason,
deprived
him
of
the
benefit
of
evidence
that
would
have
shown
he
was
innocent.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right,
that's
--
mr.
peter
westen
that
is
our
position,
but
i
should
expand
on
it.
it's
our
position
that
due
process
and
compulsory
process
entitled
the
accused
to
offer
evidence
to
show
he
is
innocent,
unless
the
state
can
show
some
reason
for
withholding
it
from
the
jury
and
in
this
--
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right.
mr.
peter
westen
we
submit
that
we
should
have
been
permitted
to
put
on
the
stand
sam
hardin
and
berkley
turner
to
testify
--
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right,
to
recite
mcdonald's
out-of-court
confessions.
mr.
peter
westen
no,
because
we
think
that,
that's
one
reason
why
mississippi
is
incapable
in
this
case
of
making
a
showing
--
of
showing
a
reason
for
withholding
the
confession,
the
presence
of
mcdonald,
renders
his
out-of-court
confession,
sufficiently
reliable.
it
provided
a
sufficient
basis
for
introducing
his
hearsay
confession
that
there
was
no
legitimate
reason
to
keep
it
out.
there
is
another
reason.
we
think
that
--
mr.
peter
westen
we
do
not
think
that
court
has
to
overrule
donnelly.
donnelly
was
not
a
constitutional
case.
it
established
a
federal
hearsay
rule,
and
it
did
so
on
facts
that
were
not
nearly
as
compelling
as
they
are
in
this
case.
in
donnelly,
the
declarant
was
dead
and
there
was
no
way
to
cross-examine
him
about
the
truth
of
his
out-of-court
statement.
in
addition,
there
was
only
one
confession
as
opposed
to
three
as
in
this
case
and
finally,
there
was
eyewitness
testimony
in
this
case
to
corroborate
the
hearsay
confession
which
is
not
the
case
in
donnelly.
mr.
peter
westen
i
think
that
--
and
that
relates
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
and
i
think
that
kind
of
rule
would
make
a
lot
of
sense.
that's
the
proposed
federal
rule,
that's
the
rule
in
california,
but
mississippi
does
not
have
that
rule.
it
excludes
hearsay
confessions
whether
or
not
there
is
a
predicate,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
priors
question
to
the
witness
to
about
whether
he
made
the
out-of-court
statement.
it
is
our
position
that
it
would
have
served
no
purpose
to
ask,
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
mcdonald's
out-of-court
confessions
for
that
truth
as
hearsay,
the
prove
chambers
was
innocent,
there
was
no
purpose
served
by
asking
mcdonald
in
mississippi.
mr.
peter
westen
that's
right,
there
are
two
arguments
we
made.
the
first
is
the
chambers
had
an
affirmative
right
to
show
he
was
innocent,
by
offering
evidence
and
--
mr.
peter
westen
that
it
was
not
he
but
someone
else
who
committed
the
crime.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
california
versus
green
and
in
dutton
versus
evans,
there
is
no
legitimate
ground
fro
withholding
those
hearsay
confessions
to
exculpate
chambers.
in
dutton
versus
evans,
the
court
--
in
dutton
versus
evans,
the
court
--
mr.
peter
westen
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
westen
we
think
that
california
versus
green,
and
dutton
versus
evans
are
cumulative
in
this
case.
both
factors
are
present
--
under
the
standard
in
california
versus
green,
the
declarant
was
present,
under
the
standard
in
dutton
versus
evans,
the
statement
was
a
spontaneous
declaration
against
penal
interest.
it
carries
the
language
of
plurality
opinion
such
indicia
of
reliability,
that
they
can
be
introduced
in
satisfaction
of
the
strict
constitutional
standard
of
the
confrontation
clause.
in
this
case
--
mr.
peter
westen
in
many
ways
we
are
--
in
some
ways,
perhaps
it's
the
converse
of
dutton
and
of
california
versus
green,
but
for
this
reason.
in
california
versus
green
and
in
dutton,
the
state
offered
hearsay
against
the
accused
under
its
own
rules
of
evidence,
and
the
question
was
were
those
hearsay
statements,
so
inherently
reliable
in
their
context
that
they
could
be
introduced
in
satisfaction
of
the
strict
constitutional
standard
of
the
confrontation
clause.
in
this
case,
chambers
contends
that
he
has
a
right
under
the
compulsory
process
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
confrontation,
and
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
offer
the
evidence
in
his
favor
affirmatively
to
prove
his
innocent,
unless
the
state
can
demonstrate,
that
the
hearsay
is
so
inherently
unreliable
that
the
only
way
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
courtroom
is
to
exclude
it
all
together.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
federal
standard,
and
i
should
say
that
whether
or
not
the
hearsay
is
reliable,
is
itself
a
federal
question.
and
it
is
a
federal
question
because
it
determines
the
scope
of
the
defendants'
right
to
prove
he
is
innocent.
and
in
light
of
california
versus
green
and
dutton
versus
evans,
i
see
no
way
in
which
mississippi
can
demonstrate
that
these
statements
are
so
unreliable
that
they
have
to
be
kept
out
to
preserve
integrity
of
the
courtroom.
mr.
peter
westen
it
is
my
feeling
that
where
a
hearsay
statement
is
corroborated
by
an
eyewitness,
and
is
corroborated
by
the
declarance
on
written
confession,
and
corroborated
by
independent
oral
confessions,
and
is
a
declaration
against
penal
interest,
and
is
spontaneous
and
other
than
on
the
scene
at
the
crime,
defense
of
the
declarant,
that
it
is
sufficiently
reliable
to
be
introduced
in
his
favor.
but,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
because
the
declarant
was
present
here.
i
think
it
is
important--
mr.
peter
westen
well,
perhaps
i
have
mislead
you
mr.
justice
powell.
it's
my
position
that
the
due
process
clause
and
the
compulsory
process
clause
entitle
the
accused
to
offer
any
exculpatory
evidence,
that
has
a
material
bearing
on
his
innocence
unless
the
state
comes
forward
and
makes
it
showing
that
the
evidence
is
so
unreliable
that
it
has
to
be
kept
out.
so
it
is
not
the
accused
to
have
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
reliable,
it
is
the
state
that
has
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
inherently
unreliable.
mr.
peter
westen
there
is
a
hearsay
rule
and
there
is
a
state
and
--
mr.
peter
westen
that
is
the
rule
that
perhaps
--
mr.
peter
westen
the
rule
in
federal
courts
which
has
been
established
in
donnelly
versus
united
states
to
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred,
establishes
that
standard,
that
establishes
that
proposition
--
mr.
peter
westen
and
the
states
are
generally
in
agreement
with
donnelly
about
that
but
i
--
mr.
peter
westen
it's
our
position
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
a
persuasive
reason
for
preventing
the
accused
from
proving
he
is
innocent.
as
per
the
hearsay
rule
as
you
would
referring
to
mr.
justice
white,
donnelly
itself
has
been
severely
questioned.
it
would
be
abolished
by
the
new
proposed
federal
rule
of
evidence,
the
dissent
by
mr.
justice
holmes
is
slowly
becoming
the
prevailing
position
in
all
of
recent
states
that
have
recently
codified
their
laws
of
evidence.
but
we
are
not
making
the
argument
as
a
general
matter
that
declarations
against
penal
interest
should
always
be
admissible.
we're
making
the
--
it's
our
possession
that
in
a
criminal
case,
where
there
is
practically
no
evidence
against
the
accused,
and
where
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
is
being
tried
for
a
crime
to
which
someone
else
committed,
and
he
has
--
mr.
peter
westen
if
this
were
a
case
like
dutton
versus
evans
in
which
there
were
19
witnesses
against
the
accused
who
all
pointed
the
finger
at
him,
there
might
be
some
question
about
whether
he
could
offer
a
heresy
confession
to
prove
that
he
didn't
do
it.
mr.
peter
westen
i
am
not
sure
that
i
know
what
you
mean
by
totality.
i
think
the
question
is,
is
the
statement
exculpatory,
is
it
material?
mr.
peter
westen
well,
the
general
propositions
on
which
we
rest
our
argument
is
that
accused
does
have
an
affirmative
right
to
prove
he
is
innocent
unless
the
state
can
make
some
showing
and
that's
in
this
case,
it
is
we
submit
absolutely
untenable
to
argue
that
out
of
court
statements
confessions
are
unreliable.
mr.
peter
westen
oh,
that's
right.
the
constitutional
basis
is
--
i
refer
the
court
to
the
opinion
on
the
last
day
of
the
term
in
june
and
the
case
holding
that
parolees
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
they
are
--
before
their
parole
is
revoked.
the
court
said
in
that
opinion,
that
the
due
process
entitles
an
accused
to
offer
evidence
to
show
he
is
innocent
and
to
confront
the
witness
is
against
him.
that's
our
position,
that
there
is
an
affirmative
right
to
an
accused
to
make
out
a
defense,
and
to
offer
evidence
that
is
reliable
and
persuasive,
and
material
to
his
innocence,
and
as
our
second
ground
which
i
haven't
discussed
yet
and
probably
won't
reach,
that
the
accused
has
a
right
to
confront
and
impeach,
cross-examine
witnesses
against
him.
mr.
peter
westen
--and
when
he
denied
the
truth
of
chamber's
affirmative
defense.
perhaps
i'll
reserve
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
westen
i
will
refer
the
court
to
our
reply
brief
and
all
of
these
questions
concerning
the
failure
to
ask
a
question
and
the
failure
to
lay
a
foundation,
but
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
it
to
mr.
rehnquist,
and
mr.
justice
white.
chambers
offered
confessions
for
two
different
purposes.
first,
as
affirmative
evidence
of
his
own
innocence.
for
that
purpose,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
proper
foundation
in
mississippi.
there
is
no
rule
in
mississippi
that
to
offer
hearsay
for
its
truth,
you
have
to
first
ask
the
witness,
that
the
witness
understand
whether
or
not
he
made
the
out
of
court
statement
.that
might
be
a
good
rule.
it
is
a
rule
in
california,
it
is
not
the
rule
in
mississippi.
as
for
the
--
we
have
offered
a
confession
for
an
entirely
different
purpose,
an
opposite
purpose.
we
offered
the
confession
to
albert
carter
in
order
to
impeach
gable
mcdonald.
in
order
to
lay
the
foundation
for
an
impeaching
confession,
it
is
necessary
to
ask
the
witness
whether
or
not
he
made
the
out
of
court
statement.
but,
we
were
not
able
to
do
that
at
the
trial
court,
because
at
that
point
in
time,
the
trial
court
had
ruled
that
we
could
not
cross-examine
mcdonald,
and
the
question
put
to
mcdonald
whether
or
not
he
had
made
an
out
of
court
confession,
inconsistent
with
what
he
had
just
testified
to,
to
the
state
would
have
been
in
the
nature
of
cross-examination.
mr.
peter
westen
yes,
and
for
the
above
reasons,
for
the
reasons
that
chambers
was
unable
to
offer
a
hearsay
confession
to
prove
he
was
innocent,
and
to
cross-examine
mcdonald.
mr.
peter
westen
no,
but
i
think
it's
implied
because
the
above
grounds
are
the
errors
that
--
are
the
specific
errors
alleged.
the
argument
was
raise
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court
specifically
even
if
it
had
not
been,
it
would
have
been
before
that
court
properly
under
the
mississippi
plain
error,
but
it
was
raised.
mr.
peter
westen
i
think
that
is
right,
but
that
is
because
they
did
not
bother
with
them.
the
questions
were
properly
before
them,
they
were
passed
upon
necessarily,
and
they
were
implicitly
denied.
thank
you.
