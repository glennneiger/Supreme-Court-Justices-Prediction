justice
potter
stewart
i
have
an
understanding
that
basically
this
case
is
–
180
degrees
offset
from
either
dutton
against
evans
or
the
green
against
california.
there
the
claim
was,
the
constitutional
claim
was,
that
the
sixth
amendment
permitted
--
did
not
permit
those
exceptions
to
hearsay
rule.
in
this
case,
you're
saying
that
the
constitution
including
the
sixth
amendment
requires
that
mississippi
make
these
exceptions
to
hearsay
rule,
that's
exactly
the
opposite
claim,isn't
it?
like
i
have
got
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
oral
confession.
