mr.
westen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
evidence
offered
that
mcdonald
ever
owned
a
gun
like
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
stage
in
the
process
of
the
proposed
impeachment
was
that
evidence
offered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
position
is
that
he
was
a
hostile
witness
inherently,
and
that
he
should
have
the
privilege
of
treating
him
that
way
from
the
outset.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
to
make
this
on
a
constitutional
basis,
not
on
a
supervisory
power
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
became
a
witness
against
in
that
sense
when
he
repudiated
his
confession,
that's
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hancock,
either
now
or
at
sometime
in
your
argument,
would
you
address
yourself
to
the
situation,
a
hypothetical
situation
that
i
will
give
you
now?
what
would
be
the
situation
under
brady
if
all
three
of
these
witnesses
had
gone
through
the
prosecutor
or
the
police,
and
told
them
of
this
confession
and
let's
add
that
mcdonald
himself
went
to
the
police
and
told
them
what
he
told
the
others.
now
the
prosecution
never
disclosed
that
to
anybody,
and
it
was
never
discovered
until
after
a
conviction.
what
would
be
the
situation
in
this
case
under
brady
and
subsequent
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
in
this
case
then
we
have
--
essentially
if
it
is
not
the
question
of
what
use
the
defense
can
make
of
that
information
after
they
discover
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
mcdonald
asked
to
whether
he
had
made
these
oral
admissions
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
unless
he
claimed,
unless
mcdonald
claimed
that
these
other
three
people
to
whom
he
made
the
oral
admissions
had
also
promised
him
money,
would
they
not
be
those
three
confessions;
would
they
not
be
as
justice
blackmun
suggested,
more
cogent,
more
reliable
than
the
one
that
he
said
was
given
for
a
promise
of
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
hancock

mr.
westen,
you
have
about
one
minute
left.
