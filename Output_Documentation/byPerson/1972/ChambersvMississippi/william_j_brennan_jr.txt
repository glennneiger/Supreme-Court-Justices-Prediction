william
j.
brennan,

was
mcdonald
ever
indicted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
westen
did
you
--
what
you
felt
you
should
be
committed
to
do
was
to
produce
the
men
to
whom
the
all
confessions
were
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
some
policemen
to
testify
that
chambers
had
admitted
to
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ones
to
whom
alleged
oral
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
gather
your
submission
is
that
you
should
have
been
permitted
to
put
on
hardin
and
whatever
the
chap
was
and
testify
what
mcdonald
have
told
them
not
for
impeachment
purposes
but
affirmatively
on
your
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
somebody
else
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
mr.
westen
is
it
that
a
totality
approach
as
mr.
justice
powell
suggested?
what
you
are
now
suggesting
as
i
understand
it
is
at
least
in
the
facts
of
this
case
where
there
is
so
little
evidence,
otherwise
against
chambers,
there
is
a
little
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
ask
you
again
why
is
this
as
mr.
justice
powell
suggested,
argument
for
a
totality
approach
in
this
context?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
mean
is,
that
whether
or
not
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case,
he
should
be
permitted
it.
that
you
are
not
arguing
that
necessarily
there
should
be
a
general
proposition
that
always
exculpatory
statement
should
be
admitted?
