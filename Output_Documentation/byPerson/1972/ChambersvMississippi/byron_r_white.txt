justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
written
confession
introduced?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
subjected
to
cross-examination
on
his
repudiation?
i
mean
he
was
subjected
to
questioning
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
all
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
introduced
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so
the
chamber
said
that
he
called
him
stand
and
said
this
showed
him
the
copy
(inaudible)
is
this
your
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
signed
it,
it
is
your
signature?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
next
question
might
have
been
did
you
also
admit
that
you
killed
liberty,
do
you
also
admit
that
to
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
let's
assume
he
had
asked.
if
the
written
confession
--
if
he
was
entitled
or
permitted
to
inquire
about
the
written
confession,
might
he
be
not
then
have
permitted
to
inquire
about
the
oral
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mcdonald
might
have
said,
yes,
i
did
tell
so
and
so
and
i
killed
the
liberty.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
he
had
denied
it
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
have
been
tough,
he
would
have
been
in
better
shape
than
he
is
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
your
position
that
he
should
be
able
to
call
witness
to
testify
as
to
an
exculpatory
confession,
wholly
aside
from
impeaching
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
just
as
a
general
proposition
even
if
mcdonald
never
has
been
called
at
all,
he
should
have
been
able
to
call
the
policeman
and
who
would
testify
as
to
and
out
of
court
confession
by
some
third
party.
is
that
your
position?
justice
byron

white
even
though
mcdonald
(inaudible)

that's

long

(inaudible)

byron

white
as
long

is
subjected

this
is

(inaudible)

it
hasn't
–
the
(inaudible)
hasn't
the

(inaudible)
the
