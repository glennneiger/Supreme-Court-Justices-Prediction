justice

rehnquist
mr.
westen,
if
the
conclusion
of
the
mcdonald's
cross-examination
by
the
state,
your
client's
counsel
asked
leave
to
cross-examine
was
denied,
but
then
he
didn't
even
make
any
effort
to
put
any
questions
on
what
would
we
call
redirect,
i
suppose.
i
would
think
he
could
have
gotten
some
of
what
he
wanted
in
--
on
redirect
without
necessarily
having
leave
to
cross?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
eyewitness
called
at
chambers
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
he
testify
that
he
had
seen
mcdonald
rather
than
chamber
shoot
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)go
so
far
as
it
require
a
predicate
for
the
hearsay
testimony
as
most
states
i
believe
do
by
first
asking
mcdonald
as
long
as
he
is
there,
did
you
ever
make
a
confession,
oral
confession
to
berkley
turner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
mississippi
practice
mr.
hancock,
is
the
trial
judge
permitted
or
authorized
to
allow
leading
questions
in
particular
questioning
situations
even
though
the
witness
is
not
an
adverse
witness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
weston,
turning
to
page
146
of
your
appendix,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
only
time
during
the
trial
proceedings
that
any
constitutional
dimension
was
suggested
to
these
rulings
of
the
trial
court
was
in
the
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdict
where
at
paragraph
six
of
that
motion
you
say
the
trial
of
the
defendant
was
not
in
accord
with
fundamental
fairness
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
had
motion
for
the
above
discussion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
these
are
the
opinions
in
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
you
can
treat
if
the
matter
of
the
constitution?
