mr.
timmie
hancock
i
believe
probably
under
such
circumstances
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
prosecution
to
inform
the
defendant
or
petitioner
here
of
any
evidence
that
was
favorable
to
him,
and
that
the
denial
of
the
state
to
do
such
would
be
certainly
considered
by
this
court
and
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
that
is
correct.
i
think
here
--
start
out
saying
that
the
state
put
on
their
case
here.
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
raise.
the
state
in
putting
on
their
case
introduced
witnesses
who
stated
that
they
saw
leon
chambers
do
the
shooting.
the
jury
was
justified
from
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
one
witness
testified
that
he
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
one
witness
testified
that
he
saw
chambers
when
he
actually
pulled
the
trigger
and
he
saw
the
wounded
man
flinching
as
his
bullets
hit
him.
another
witness
testified
that
he
saw
leon
chambers
bring
his
hand
down
and
about
that
time,
he
heard
the
shot
fired.
mr.
timmie
hancock
these
were
policemen.
mr.
timmie
hancock
oh,
chambers
was
shot
immediately
thereafter
by
the
man
whom
he
shot.
chambers
shot
aaron
liberty,
who
was
a
policeman.
at
that
time,
aaron
liberty
fell
back
and
then
he
turned
around
and
fired
one
shot
into
the
air
and
then
shot
leon
chambers.
leon
chambers
was
carried
to
the
hospital.
mr.
timmie
hancock
the
sheriff,
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
was
to
the
fact
that
he
was
considered
him
to
be
under
arrest.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
was
arraigned
though
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
believe
he
was
--
it
was
sometime
later,
i
do
not
remember
the
exact
time.
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
leon
chambers
during
this
time
was
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
i
think
that
depends
to
some
extent
upon
the
physical
condition
of
leon
chambers
at
the
time.
mr.
timmie
hancock
pardon
sir.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
did
not
know.
this
was
not
brought
up
in
the
trial,
i
do
not
believe.
mr.
timmie
hancock
no
your
honor,
not
based
upon
the
record,
i
do
not,
but
this
question--
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
know.
the
record
does
not
show
that.
mr.
timmie
hancock
pardon
me?
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
was
arrested.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
was
arrested
i
believe
within
a
week
after
he
was
shot.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
was
released
on
bail.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
believe
yes
sir
it
is,
he
was
released
on
$15,000
bail
i
believe.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
am
not
sure
when
he
was
released,
that
question
was
not
raised
previous
to
this
time.
the
petitioner
now
states
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
put
on
his
affirmative
defense.
however,
the
petitioner
was
allowed
to
introduce
a
witness
who
testified
that
he
saw
gable
mcdonald
shoot
leon
chambers.
now,
gable
mcdonald
was
not
the
defendant.
the
petitioner
tried
--
attempted
to
show
that
he
was
innocent
by
showing
that
another
man
was
guilty,
this
man
being
gable
mcdonald.
as
i
said,
the
court,
trial
court
allowed
the
petitioner
to
put
on
testimony
of
an
eye-witnesses,
of
a
person
who
said
he
was
--
that
he
was
an
eye-witness
and
that
he
saw
gable
mcdonald
shoot
leon
chambers.
also,
the
defendant
was
allowed
to
call
gable
mcdonald
as
a
witness.
gable
mcdonald
admitted
that
he
confessed
to
this
crime.
he
said
that
he
went
to
the
petitioners'
counsel,
petitioners'
lower
court,
to
trial
court,
he
went
to
petitioners'
council
and
gave
them
a
confession.
now,
this
confession
was
introduced
into
evidence.
the
court
allowed
this
confession
to
be
introduced,
and
question,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
were
required
to
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
donnelly
and
universal
rule
almost,
but
the
trial
court
allowed
this
confession
to
be
introduced
into
evidence,
and
the
state
questioned
gable
mcdonald
and
gable
mcdonald
testified
that
he
did
give
the
confession.
and
he
testified
that
he
gave
the
confession
because
he
was
promised
that
he
would
get
some
money
for
it,
if
he
would
confess.
that
the
police
and
law
enforcements
officers
were
never
know
about
it
and
that
it
would
ultimately
wind
up
in
a
lawsuit
wherein
he
would
get
one-third
of
the
money,
it
was
brought
about
in
this
lawsuit.
so
mcdonald
repudiated
his
confession
and
he
explained
why.
at
that
time,
leon
chambers
brought
on
three
more
witnesses
and
he
asked
them,
if
gable
mcdonald
and
confessed
to
them
the
prosecuting
attorneys
objected
to
this
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
hearsay.
well,
certainly
it
was.
these
statements
were
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
the
truthfulness
of
those
statements.
well,
the
person
who
knew
the
truth
if
those
statements
were
made
by
gable
mcdonald,
was
gable
mcdonald
himself.
he
is
only
individual
who
would
know
if
he
made
those
statements
and
if
whether
they
were
true.
mr.
timmie
hancock
right,
right.
i
believe
that
is
true.
i
think
the
state
allowed
more
evidence,
more
affirmative
evidence
for
the
defendant
to
go
in,
then
the
state
was
required
to
do
so.
mr.
timmie
hancock
no
your
honor,
he
was
not.
the
petitioner
now
states
that
he
did
not
ask
him
because
the
trial
court
refused
to
allow
mcdonald
to
be
questioned
as
an
adverse
witness.
now
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
believe
it
necessarily
can.
gable
mcdonald
would
be
the
only
one
who
--
gable
mcdonald
was
available
as
a
witness
and
he
did
testify
in
this
trial.
he
would
be
the
one
to
testify
yes,
i
gave
those
confessions,
and
those
confessions
were
truthful,
or
yes,
i
gave
those
confessions
and
they
were
false,
or
no
i
do
not
give
those
confessions.
the
testimony
of
these
other
witnesses
would
be
based
purely
up
on
hearsay.
they
would
not
know
the
truthfulness
of
them.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
necessarily
think
so,
because
after
this
great
deal
of
time,
the
gable
mcdonald
knew
that
an
investigation
was
being
conducted
into
the
trial.
he
knew
that
prosecution
would
be
coming
about
and
under
these
circumstances,
he
then
made
his
written
confession.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
there
would
be
any
greater
grounds
for
the
admissions
to
be
truthful
soon
after,
then
it
would
have
been
at
the
later
date.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
did
testify
not
as
to
the
confession
because
an
objection
to
that
was
sustained
upon
the
grounds
that
it
was
hearsay.
but
one
of
the
parties
who
was
going
to
testify
to
this,
did
testify
and
he
testified
that
he
saw
gable
mcdonald.
the
witness
testified
that
he
saw
gable
mcdonald
shoot
in
the
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
believe
that
your
honor.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
am
not
being
mistaken,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
they
sustain
an
objection
to
his
testimony
that
he
saw
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
oh,
yes.
mr.
timmie
hancock
yes,
that
has
to
do
hearsay
objections
on
whether
or
not
a
confession
was
given.
mr.
timmie
hancock
the
oral
confession,
this
is
not
sustained
objection
to
his
eye-witness
testimony
that
i
saw
gable
mcdonald
shoot
leon
chambers.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
end
of
appendix,
it
is
in
the
trial.
it
is
in
the
trial
that
gable
mcdonald
testified
that
he
--
hardin
testified
that
he
did
see
gable
mcdonald
shoot
leon
chambers.
the
gable
mcdonald,
leon
chambers
rather
could
have
asked
gable
mcdonald
if
he
in
fact
made
these
other
confessions,
but
he
did
not
do
so.
he
chose
not
to
ask
him.
he
says
he
could
not
because
he
had
requested
the
trial
court
to
allow
him
to
question
gable
mcdonald
as
an
adverse
witness.
now,
under
mississippi
rules,
a
petitioner,
a
defendant
is
allowed
to
question
a
witness
as
an
adverse
witness,
a
witness
whom
he
calls
as
an
adverse
witness
when
it
is
shown
that
the
testimony
of
the
witness
takes
him
by
surprise
or
he
is
hostile.
well,
there
was
no
showing
here
in
this
case
but
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
there
is
measured
significance
to
the
word
cross-examination.
he
could
have
still
ask
gable
mcdonald,
did
you
make
another
confessions?
he
never
did
this,
he
never
questioned
gable
mcdonald
at
all.
then
he
come
back
on
redirect
examination
after
gable
mcdonald
said
no,
the
confession
--
i
did
give
a
previous
confession
and
that
confession
was
not
true.
mr.
timmie
hancock
this
is
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
but
here
no
attempt
was
made
at
that.
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
as
i
said,
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
cross-examine
and
this
is
as
i
said,
there
is
nothing
i
do
not
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
but,
maybe
this
was
a
descending
opinion,
but
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
magic
meaning
to
the
word
cross-examination.
he
could
have
asked
him
on
direct
examination,
not
only
a
lead
question
possibly.
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
maybe
the
testimony
that
leon
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
we
ordinarily
are
bound
by
the
answer
however
the
answer
might
be
such
as
to
allow
the
defendant
to
then
question.
mr.
timmie
hancock
that
was
an
after
the
fact
opinion.
mr.
timmie
hancock
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
in
lower
court.
mr.
timmie
hancock
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
and
then
later
requested
the
trial
court
to
proclaim
gable
mcdonald
to
be
an
adverse
witness.
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
when
the
trial
was
--
when
the
motion
was
first
made,
the
judge
said,
i
will
reserve
my
ruling
on
that
later,
when
gable
mcdonald
is
introduced
as
a
witness.
gable
mcdonald
was
introduced
as
a
witness.
this
motion
was
made
to
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
court
overruled
it.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
showing
that
any
of
gable
mcdonald's
testimony
was
--
took
the
defendant
by
surprise.
he
was
willing
and
able
to
answer
every
question
that
was
asked
and
that
they
are
willing
to
testify.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
did
not
give
him
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
i
would
think
that
would
depend
upon
the
answer.
mr.
timmie
hancock
the
law
in
mississippi
as
is
in
most
jurisdictions
now
is
that
you
cannot
impeach
your
own
witness
under
ordinary
circumstances.
mr.
timmie
hancock
if
gable
mcdonald
had
said,
well,
i
refuse
to
answer
that
at
that
point,
he
would
become
a
hostile
witness
and
he
could
have
been
cross-examine
under
mississippi
law.
mr.
timmie
hancock
yes.
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
i
believe
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
goes
to
matter
of
the
trial
strategy.
i
cannot
read
into
the
trial
record,
the
trial
strategy
of
why
he
elected
not
to
question,
and
why
he
did
not.
but,
in
any
event,
we
would
consider
that
if
there
were
error,
it
was
a
harmless
error
because
there
was
testimony
to
the
effect
that
was
put
before
the
jury
that
gable
mcdonald
shot
aaron
liberty,
and
eye-witness
--
the
witness
testified
that
he
was
an
eye-witness
to
this.
gable
mcdonald's
confession
was
put
before
the
jury
that
he
on
one
occasion
confessed
to
the
crime.
we
do
not
believe
this
would
be
devastating
in
anyway.
we
believe
under
the
circumstances
and
rulings
of
the
trial
court
it
was
proper
that
he
did
receive
a
fair
trail
and
if
there
were
any
errors,
it
was
purely
harmless
error.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
believe
probably
under
such
circumstances
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
prosecution
to
inform
the
defendant
or
petitioner
here
of
any
evidence
that
was
favorable
to
him,
and
that
the
denial
of
the
state
to
do
such
would
be
certainly
considered
by
this
court
and
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
that
is
correct.
i
think
here
--
start
out
saying
that
the
state
put
on
their
case
here.
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
raise.
the
state
in
putting
on
their
case
introduced
witnesses
who
stated
that
they
saw
leon
chambers
do
the
shooting.
the
jury
was
justified
from
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
one
witness
testified
that
he
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
one
witness
testified
that
he
saw
chambers
when
he
actually
pulled
the
trigger
and
he
saw
the
wounded
man
flinching
as
his
bullets
hit
him.
another
witness
testified
that
he
saw
leon
chambers
bring
his
hand
down
and
about
that
time,
he
heard
the
shot
fired.
mr.
timmie
hancock
these
were
policemen.
mr.
timmie
hancock
oh,
chambers
was
shot
immediately
thereafter
by
the
man
whom
he
shot.
chambers
shot
aaron
liberty,
who
was
a
policeman.
at
that
time,
aaron
liberty
fell
back
and
then
he
turned
around
and
fired
one
shot
into
the
air
and
then
shot
leon
chambers.
leon
chambers
was
carried
to
the
hospital.
mr.
timmie
hancock
the
sheriff,
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
was
to
the
fact
that
he
was
considered
him
to
be
under
arrest.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
was
arraigned
though
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
believe
he
was
--
it
was
sometime
later,
i
do
not
remember
the
exact
time.
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
leon
chambers
during
this
time
was
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
i
think
that
depends
to
some
extent
upon
the
physical
condition
of
leon
chambers
at
the
time.
mr.
timmie
hancock
pardon
sir.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
did
not
know.
this
was
not
brought
up
in
the
trial,
i
do
not
believe.
mr.
timmie
hancock
no
your
honor,
not
based
upon
the
record,
i
do
not,
but
this
question--
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
know.
the
record
does
not
show
that.
mr.
timmie
hancock
pardon
me?
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
was
arrested.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
was
arrested
i
believe
within
a
week
after
he
was
shot.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
was
released
on
bail.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
believe
yes
sir
it
is,
he
was
released
on
$15,000
bail
i
believe.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
am
not
sure
when
he
was
released,
that
question
was
not
raised
previous
to
this
time.
the
petitioner
now
states
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
put
on
his
affirmative
defense.
however,
the
petitioner
was
allowed
to
introduce
a
witness
who
testified
that
he
saw
gable
mcdonald
shoot
leon
chambers.
now,
gable
mcdonald
was
not
the
defendant.
the
petitioner
tried
--
attempted
to
show
that
he
was
innocent
by
showing
that
another
man
was
guilty,
this
man
being
gable
mcdonald.
as
i
said,
the
court,
trial
court
allowed
the
petitioner
to
put
on
testimony
of
an
eye-witnesses,
of
a
person
who
said
he
was
--
that
he
was
an
eye-witness
and
that
he
saw
gable
mcdonald
shoot
leon
chambers.
also,
the
defendant
was
allowed
to
call
gable
mcdonald
as
a
witness.
gable
mcdonald
admitted
that
he
confessed
to
this
crime.
he
said
that
he
went
to
the
petitioners'
counsel,
petitioners'
lower
court,
to
trial
court,
he
went
to
petitioners'
council
and
gave
them
a
confession.
now,
this
confession
was
introduced
into
evidence.
the
court
allowed
this
confession
to
be
introduced,
and
question,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
were
required
to
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
donnelly
and
universal
rule
almost,
but
the
trial
court
allowed
this

to
be

and
the
state
questioned
gable
mcdonald
and
gable
mcdonald
testified
that
he
did
give
the
confession.
and
he
testified
that
he
gave
the
confession
because
he
was
promised
that
he
would
get
some
money
for
it,
if
he
would
confess.
that
the
police
and
law
enforcements
officers
were
never
know
about
it
and
that
it
would
ultimately
wind
up
in
a
lawsuit
wherein
he
would
get
one-third
of
the
money,
it
was
brought
about
in
this
lawsuit.
so
mcdonald
repudiated
his
confession
and
he
explained
why.
at
that
time,
leon
chambers
brought
on
three
more
witnesses
and
he
asked
them,
if
gable
mcdonald
and
confessed
to
them
the
prosecuting
attorneys
objected
to
this
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
hearsay.
well,
certainly
it
was.
these
statements
were
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
the
truthfulness
of
those
statements.
well,
the
person
who
knew
the
truth
if
those
statements
were
made
by
gable
mcdonald,
was
gable
mcdonald
himself.
he
is
only
individual
who
would
know
if
he
made
those
statements
and
if
whether
they
were
true.
mr.
timmie
hancock
right,
right.
i
believe
that
is
true.
i
think
the
state
allowed
more
evidence,
more
affirmative
evidence
for
the
defendant
to
go
in,
then
the
state
was
required
to
do
so.
mr.
timmie
hancock
no
your
honor,
he
was
not.
the
petitioner
now
states
that
he
did
not
ask
him
because
the
trial
court
refused
to
allow
mcdonald
to
be
questioned
as
an
adverse
witness.
now
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
believe
it
necessarily
can.
gable
mcdonald
would
be
the
only
one
who
--
gable
mcdonald
was
available
as
a
witness
and
he
did
testify
in
this
trial.
he
would
be
the
one
to
testify
yes,
i
gave
those
confessions,
and
those
confessions
were
truthful,
or
yes,
i
gave
those
confessions
and
they
were
false,
or
no
i
do
not
give
those
confessions.
the
testimony
of
these
other
witnesses
would
be
based
purely
up
on
hearsay.
they
would
not
know
the
truthfulness
of
them.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
necessarily
think
so,
because
after
this
great
deal
of
time,
the
gable
mcdonald
knew
that
an
investigation
was
being
conducted
into
the
trial.
he
knew
that
prosecution
would
be
coming
about
and
under
these
circumstances,
he
then
made
his
written
confession.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
there
would
be
any
greater
grounds
for
the
admissions
to
be
truthful
soon
after,
then
it
would
have
been
at
the
later
date.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
did
testify
not
as
to
the
confession
because
an
objection
to
that
was
sustained
upon
the
grounds
that
it
was
hearsay.
but
one
of
the
parties
who
was
going
to
testify
to
this,
did
testify
and
he
testified
that
he
saw
gable
mcdonald.
the
witness
testified
that
he
saw
gable
mcdonald
shoot
in
the
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
do
not
believe
that
your
honor.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
am
not
being
mistaken,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
they
sustain
an
objection
to
his
testimony
that
he
saw
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
oh,
yes.
mr.
timmie
hancock
yes,
that
has
to
do
hearsay
objections
on
whether
or
not
a
confession
was
given.
mr.
timmie
hancock
the
oral
confession,
this
is
not
sustained
objection
to
his
eye-witness
testimony
that
i
saw
gable
mcdonald
shoot
leon
chambers.
mr.
timmie
hancock
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
end
of
appendix,
it
is
in
the
trial.
it
is
in
the
trial
that
gable
mcdonald
testified
that
he
--
hardin
testified
that
he
did
see
gable
mcdonald
shoot
leon
chambers.
the
gable
mcdonald,
leon
chambers
rather
could
have
asked
gable
mcdonald
if
he
in
fact
made
these
other
confessions,
but
he
did
not
do
so.
he
chose
not
to
ask
him.
he
says
he
could
not
because
he
had
requested
the
trial
court
to
allow
him
to
question
gable
mcdonald
as
an
adverse
witness.
now,
under
mississippi
rules,
a
petitioner,
a
defendant
is
allowed
to
question
a
witness
as
an
adverse
witness,
a
witness
whom
he
calls
as
an
adverse
witness
when
it
is
shown
that
the
testimony
of
the
witness
takes
him
by
surprise
or
he
is
hostile.
well,
there
was
no
showing
here
in
this
case
but
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
there
is
measured
significance
to
the
word
cross-examination.
he
could
have
still
ask
gable
mcdonald,
did
you
make
another
confessions?
he
never
did
this,
he
never
questioned
gable
mcdonald
at
all.
then
he
come
back
on
redirect
examination
after
gable
mcdonald
said
no,
the
confession
--
i
did
give
a
previous
confession
and
that
confession
was
not
true.
mr.
timmie
hancock
this
is
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
but
here
no
attempt
was
made
at
that.
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
as
i
said,
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
cross-examine
and
this
is
as
i
said,
there
is
nothing
i
do
not
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
but,
maybe
this
was
a
descending
opinion,
but
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
magic
meaning
to
the
word
cross-examination.
he
could
have
asked
him
on
direct
examination,
not
only
a
lead
question
possibly.
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
maybe
the
testimony
that
leon
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
we
ordinarily
are
bound
by
the
answer
however
the
answer
might
be
such
as
to
allow
the
defendant
to
then
question.
mr.
timmie
hancock
that
was
an
after
the
fact
opinion.
mr.
timmie
hancock
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
in
lower
court.
mr.
timmie
hancock
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
and
then
later
requested
the
trial
court
to
proclaim
gable
mcdonald
to
be
an
adverse
witness.
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
when
the
trial
was
--
when
the
motion
was
first
made,
the
judge
said,
i
will
reserve
my
ruling
on
that
later,
when
gable
mcdonald
is
introduced
as
a
witness.
gable
mcdonald
was
introduced
as
a
witness.
this
motion
was
made
to
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
court
overruled
it.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
showing
that
any
of
gable
mcdonald's
testimony
was
--
took
the
defendant
by
surprise.
he
was
willing
and
able
to
answer
every
question
that
was
asked
and
that
they
are
willing
to
testify.
mr.
timmie
hancock
he
did
not
give
him
--
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
i
would
think
that
would
depend
upon
the
answer.
mr.
timmie
hancock
the
law
in
mississippi
as
is
in
most
jurisdictions
now
is
that
you
cannot
impeach
your
own
witness
under
ordinary
circumstances.
mr.
timmie
hancock
if
gable
mcdonald
had
said,
well,
i
refuse
to
answer
that
at
that
point,
he
would
become
a
hostile
witness
and
he
could
have
been
cross-examine
under
mississippi
law.
mr.
timmie
hancock
yes.
mr.
timmie
hancock
well,
i
believe
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
goes
to
matter
of
the
trial
strategy.
i
cannot
read
into
the
trial
record,
the
trial
strategy
of
why
he
elected
not
to
question,
and
why
he
did
not.
but,
in
any
event,
we
would
consider
that
if
there
were
error,
it
was
a
harmless
error
because
there
was
testimony
to
the
effect
that
was
put
before
the
jury
that
gable
mcdonald
shot
aaron
liberty,
and
eye-witness
--
the
witness
testified
that
he
was
an
eye-witness
to
this.
gable
mcdonald's
confession
was
put
before
the
jury
that
he
on
one
occasion
confessed
to
the
crime.
we
do
not
believe
this
would
be
devastating
in
anyway.
we
believe
under
the
circumstances
and
rulings
of
the
trial
court
it
was
proper
that
he
did
receive
a
fair
trail
and
if
there
were
any
errors,
it
was
purely
harmless
error.
