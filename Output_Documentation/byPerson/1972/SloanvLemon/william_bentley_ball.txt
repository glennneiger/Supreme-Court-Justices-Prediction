mr.
william
bentley
ball
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commonwealth,
following
lemon
versus
kurtzman,
carefully
structured
the
act
which
you
are
considering
today,
structured
it
to
thrive
fully
and
faithfully
to
meet
every
standard
which
this
court
had
expressed
in
its
various
decisions
under
the
establishment
clause.
why,
in
a
effort
to
solve
a
two-fold
problem
which
simply
won't
go
away.
the
first
part
of
that
problem
having
been
described
by
the
attorney
general
just
now;
a
massive
public
problem
which
involves
the
total
fiscal,
the
economic
and
educational
crisis
that
the
commonwealth
today
does
face.
secondly,
the
severe
problem
of
thousands
of
pennsylvania
individual
parents,
broad
masses
of
parents
and
the
middle
income
group
and
including
the
lower
income
parents
in
pennsylvania
were
involved
in
a
problem
relating
to
law,
to
conscience
and
the
family
economy.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
12
such
parents
here
this
afternoon.
a
group
described
in
our
papers
as
jose
diaz
et
al.,
who
last
year
had
paid
a
tuition
at
a
protestant,
a
catholic,
a
jewish
or
a
non
sectarian
school.
they
are
members
of
a
numerous
group
in
pennsylvania
who
are
in
fact
truly
caught
in
a
three-sided
vice.
they
are
faced
with
the
compulsion
of
law
to
begin
with,
they
are
faced
with
the
fact
that
the
under
criminal
sanction
of
pennsylvania
compulsory
attendance
law
requires
them
to
have
their
children
in
some
school,
which
meets
reasonable
state
requirements.
they
are
also
under
legal
compulsion
of
course
to
do
what
they
have
always
been
doing,
they
are
all
tax
payers
and
paying
their
public
school
tax.
they
also
face
a
compulsion
for
conscience
which
impels
them
to
seek
other
education
for
their
children
and
thirdly,
they
are
faced
with
the
twin
effects
which
we
hardly
need
to
describe
further
today
of
inflation
and
taxation.
now,
how
does
act
92
seek
to
remedy
this
problem?
it
does
it
by
giving
un-earmarked
payments
to
people
whom
the
legislature
determine
to
have
special
need
because
they
carry
a
special
burden.
the
proof
of
that
burden,
the
general
assembly
found
to
be
best
selected
proof
of
their
carrying
of
this
burden
is
the
fact
that
they
had
in
fact
paid
a
tuition
at
a
non-public
school,
the
year
past.
now
court
below
looked
at
the
statute
and
found
it
unconstitutional.
the
court
below
said
that
this
statute,
first
of
all
it
said,
it
had
a
secular
legislative
purpose
and
that
wins
the
court's
tests.
it
then
looked
at
the
entanglement
problem
and
found
no
kind
of
entanglement
whatever
to
be
involved
in
this
statute.
what
it
did
at
least
grope
at
the
idea
that
the
statute
has
a
primary
effective
advancing
religion.
i
say
that
the
court
groped
at
it
because
as
you
read
the
opinion,
you
find
that
it's
hard
to
point
it
right
down
where
you
find
the
court
truly
talking
about
primacy
or
principle
character
of
the
fact
and
advancing
religion
rather
than
having
possibly
a
relationship
to
religion.
at
any
rate,
the
court
plays
what
we
will
be
willing
to
call
the
failure
of
the
act
to
meet
the
primary
effect
test
on
three
different
arguments.
the
first
that
the
parents
were
merely
a
conduit
under
the
act
that
they
are
merely
a
conduit
under
the
act
for
the
payment
of
public
funds
to
nonpublic
schools.
secondly,
it
was
possible
and
quite
likely
that
the
parents
were
going
to
use
the
money
they
got
under
these
payments
in
the
future,
fourth
payments,
to
sectarian
schools.
thirdly,
the
court
pointed
out
and
this
is
not
in
its
opinion,
but
appears
in
its
order,
its
final
order,
at
page
53
a
of
the
appendix,
pointed
out
that
or
stated
that
90%
of
the
children
attending
nonpublic
schools
in
pennsylvania
are
enrolled
in
schools
for
which
are
religious
in
character.
there
was
no
record
evidence
of
this,
but
this
was
the
court's
reasoning.
as
to
the
conduit
argument,
here
the
court
immediately
invoked
as
did
mr.
(inaudible)
this
morning
to
which
it
grant
cases
from
the
southern
states
allen
versus
day
(ph)
and
so
on
and
equated
the
arrangement
provided
by
the
act
with
the
situation
found
in
those
cases.
the
handling
to
a
parent
of
a
check
which
would
be
negotiable
only
at
an
institution
or
the
providing
of
a
parent
with
a
voucher
which
he
could
then
could
take
an
exchange
for
education
at
an
institution.
none
of
these
techniques
appear
in
this
act.
there
was
no
such
provision
under
act
92.
there
is
no
condition
whatever
attached
to
payment
under
this
act.
the
money
thus,
in
fact,
in
legal
fact,
become
that
of
the
parent.
it's
subject
to
his
own
limited
power
of
disposal.
the
money
becomes
his
private
money
and
regardless
of
what
hopes
the
state
public
policy
has
as
to
how
he
may
relieve
the
education
prices,
in
expending
this
tuition,
the
very
legal
fact
of
the
act
is
that
he
may
use
it
for
education
or
he
may
not.
he
need
not
under
the
terms
of
the
act
use
it
for
education.
no
institution
and
i
want
to
underscore
this
to
your
honors,
no
institution
has
a
breadth
of
legal
claim,
right
title
or
interest
in
one
set
of
the
money
in
question.
now
the
court
almost
as
though
it
felt
it
couldn't
make,
they
conduit
argument
stick,
invented
then
an
amazingly
vague
standard
for
constitutional
adjudication.
in
its
rule
of
possible
and
quite
likely,
the
court
said
this
that
the
act
offended
the
establishment
clause
and
now
i
quote
“a
possible
and
quite
likely
use
of
the
aid
under
review
is
to
enable
parents
to
continue
to
pay
tuition
at
sectarian
schools.”
this
rule
has
no
foundation
in
decisions
of
this
court.
it's
guess
work
perhaps
it's
intelligent
guess
work,
but
it
is
that.
it
certainly
does
not
measure
up
to
and
is
not
synonymous
with
or
any
privilege
of
the
clear
standard
which
this
court
stated
it
when
it
said
that
to
meet
the
strictures
of
the
establishment
clause
it
must
be
shown
that
an
enactment
does
not
have
a
primary
effect
advancing
religion.
thirdly,
on
the
matter
of
90%.
i
mentioned
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
record
of
evidence
at
all
on
the
90%
figure
respecting
children.
however,
it
also
must
be
considered
that
these
payments
go
to
individuals
and
the
law
controls
or
conditions
no
man's
choice
under
this
act,
the
choice
of
no
parent.
thirdly,
if
one
is
to
take
play
the
percentage
game,
i
think
we
begin
when
it's
like
problem
which
have
possibly
not
been
foreseen.
if
one
would
have
make
a
head
count
with
respect
to
who
is
getting
certain
welfare
benefits
or
who
is
benefiting
under
an
anti-poverty
program
and
then
determined
as
a
result
of
that
head
count
that
the
people
who
were
beneficiaries
were
90%
lax,
would
this
make
this
class
legislation.
we
have
just
enacted
a
perfectly
splendid
program,
and
immensely
humane
program
for
relief,
of
relief
through
expenditure
of
some
$135
million
of
tax
payer's
money
for
resettlement
in
israel
of
jewish
refugees
from
religious
persecution
in
the
soviet
union.
undoubtedly,
90%
of
these
individuals
are
of
a
single
religious
faith.
certainly,
this
cannot
be
taken
as
a
standard
for
invalidating
any
such
program.
what
we
have
here
and
we
believe
is
a
measure
which
in
no
ways
offends
the
establishment
clause.
we
have,
however,
raised
the
affirmative
defenses
as
your
honors
have
doubtless
noted
in
our
brief
and
from
the
record.
the
parents
in
this
case,
have
raised
affirmative
defenses
of
equal
protection
which
i
should
like
briefly
to
comment
upon.
i
should
point
out
at
the
offset
that
we
are
not
here
arguing
the
proposition
which
was
argued
for
in
brusca,
the
case
to
which
mr.
pfeffer
referred
this
morning,
where
parents
of
nonpublic
school,
children
asserted
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
participate
in
public
funds,
a
right
to
have
these
funds
devoted
to
nonpublic
education.
rather
here
a
statute
exists
and
that
statute
bears
un-earmarked
assistance
benefits
to
a
classic
parents
rationally
determined
and
without
conditions
attached.
i
would
like
to
talk
first
of
all
about
parents
who
are
described
in
the
papers,
and
in
our
briefs,
as
the
watson
parents.
mr.
&
mrs.
watson
have
a
daughter
ellen
who
attends
baldwin
school,
a
nonsectarian
school
in
pennsylvania.
they
are
express
beneficiaries
of
this
act.
they
are
parents
of
nonpublic
school
children
and
nonpublic
school
is
clearly
defined
in
the
act
in
a
measure
and
in
a
way
that
includes
a
nonsectarian
nonpublic
schools.
they
cannot
have
an
establishment
problem.
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
have
an
establishment
problem.
they
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
the
lower
court
and
the
court
denied
their
motion
on
a
peculiar
ground
that
although
they
were
--
had
been
granted
intervention
as
a
right.
court's
reasoning
was
they
--
that
the
plaintiff's
had
sought
no
relief
against
them.
later
the
order
of
the
court
was
to
state
that
90%
of
the
beneficiaries
of
this
act
being
the
parents
of
children
attending
sectarian
schools,
they
“undoubtedly
by
that
sought
provide
another
means
for
denying
these
individuals,
the
benefits
of
the
act.”
it's
perfectly
clear
that
to
cut
the
watsons
out
of
the
act
underground
that
they
are
minority
beneficiaries
under
the
court's
reasoning
would
certainly
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
to
say
that
they
were
not
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
act
directly
conflicts
with
what
the
legislature
itself
said
in
its
definition,
a
parents
of
nonpublic
schools.
the
second
group
of
beneficiaries
under
this
act
we're
here
to
speak
for
today,
are
mr.
&
mrs.
jose
diaz,
who
have
a
boy
jose
junior
in
st.
peter
apostle
school
in
philadelphia,
mr.
&
mrs.
kurtzman
whose
daughter,
debbi,
attends
redeemer
--
attended
redeemer
lutheran
school
and
he
is
now
attending
public
school.
here
incidentally,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
an
example
of
the
parent
who
is
eligible
today
for
the
benefit
of
the
act
on
account
of
the
fact
that
he
had,
had,
these
parents
had
had
their
children,
they
had
paid
a
tuition
for
their
children
in
a
school,
in
a
sectarian
school.
now
they
have
elected
high
school
time
as
coming,
they
are
electing
to
send
these
children
--
this
child
to
a
public
school.
another
pair
of
parents
are
mr.
&
mrs.
zorbits
(ph)
who
have
their
daughter
roselleth
at
jacob's
school.
now
these
people
have
been
told
by
the
court
that
they
may
not
participate
in
the
benefits
of
this
act.
the
court
below
said
that
these
latter
parents
cannot
be
paid
because
of
two
things.
first
of
all
they
had
antecedently
paid
out
of
their
own
pockets,
money
for
tuition
last
year.
secondly,
the
court
thinks
it's
likely
possible
and
quite
likely
that
in
another
year,
they
will
pay
another
tuition
to
maintain
that
child
in
a
sectarian
school
even
though,
as
we
have
said
the
payment
of
that
subsequent
tuition
is
absolutely,
certainly
a
payment
of
out
of
private
money.
therefore,
the
court
has
said
that
these
parents
must
be
excluded
from
a
public
welfare
benefit,
because
of
what?
because
they
exercised
an
act
of
the
will
whereby
yesterday
they
spent
their
own
money,
their
own
private
money
because
of
their
religion
and
tomorrow
for
the
same
reason,
they
may
again
expend
their
private
money.
a
person
certainly
may
not
be
excluded
from
a
program
of
public
welfare
benefits
because
of
his
race,
because
of
alienage
or
because
he
has
done
something
which
is
nothing
other
than
an
exercise
of
religious
choice.
finally
may
it
please
the
court,
the
appellees
have
devoted
some
time
and
much
bigger
in
speaking
of
political
entanglement
with
respect
to
this
act.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
this
act
is
self
executing,
paid
for
out
of
the
cigarette
tax.
there
is
no
record.
the
court
below
in
no
way
discussed
any
such
issue
and
there
is
no
record
whatsoever
of
any
evidence
at
all
at
the
plaintiff
sought
to
introduce
below
on
this
issue,
referring
conceivably
to
leave
the
matter
to
supposition
to
guesswork.
in
conclusion,
may
i
say
to
the
court
that
a
secular
need
of
the
nation
is
today
in
a
growingly
socialized
society
for
people
to
be
reasonably
enabled
to
follow
conscientious
choices,
nowhere
is
this
more
important
than
with
respect
to
education,
especially
under
this
act
where
it
is
possible
that
a
such
choice
may
help
some
parents
to
rear
their
children
in
the
traditions
of
civility,
non-violence,
decency
and
morality
as
i
like
to
put.
mr.
william
bentley
ball
if
i
may.
mr.
william
bentley
ball
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.i
will
save
you
30
seconds
mr.
reath.
mr
mann
spoke
first
of
all
about
the
character
of
aided
activity.
the
aided
activity
here,
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
call
it
aided
activity
a
parochial
school.
the
aided
activity
here
is
an
act
of
will
of
the
parent.
i
don't
believe
the
bridge
was
crossed.
we
have
talked
about
conduit
throughout
this
case
but
nothing
that
mr
mann
said
in
spite
of
all
appeals,
the
questions
concerning
religious
controversy,
got
him
across
that
legal
point,
nothing
can
change
the
act.
the
act
in
fact
does
rack
money
to
individuals
who
have
total
disposition
over
that
money.
his
whole
case
depends
on
the
conduit
except
for
his
remarks
concerning
religious
divisiveness.
now
i
beg
the
court,
where
is
their
a
record
of
this.
it
is
fine
to
talk
about
what
no
historical
research
supports
the
founding
fathers
as
having
said.
but
we
have
to
live
in
today's
day.
when
we
look
at
the
record,
which
the
plaintiffs
could
have
made
below,
which
they
neglected
made
below,
where
was
the
religious
divisiveness?
does
it
consist
in
the
fact
that
some
people
decide
to
go
into
the
forum
and
make
a
religious
issue
out
of
something.
we
didn’t
even
have
it
in
spite
of
the
intervention
of
religious
groups
in
their
own
names
in
pennsylvania.
we
have
shown,
we
have
been
willing
to
show
that
the
record,
the
voting
record
was
on
both
sides
of
the
island
favor
of
this
act
and
opposed
to
this
act
that
jews,
protestants
and
catholics
voted
against
the
act,
voted
for
the
act.
there’s
absolutely
no
foundation
for
this
perfectly
luridness
charge
of
a
holy
war
going
out
in
pennsylvania.
the
g.i
bill
of
rights
is
perfectly
justified
in
the
same
way
that
this
act
is
justified.
certainly
people
could
have
made
a
religious
issue
out
of
it.
2000
people
were
educated
at
divinity
school
under
a
g
i
bill
of
rights
which
at
that
time
required
that
the
check
go
directly
to
the
school.
you
can't
violate
the
constitution
because
somebody
was
coming
back
from
war.
if
that
act
which
was
generally
accepted
just
as
the
pennsylvania
act
is
generally
accepted.
if
that
act
were
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
a
very
strange
thing
in
our
history,
it
was
broadly
accepted
just
as
this
act
is
being
broadly
accepted
today
among
the
people
of
the
state
in
real
life
in
actual
pennsylvania.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
bentley
ball
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commonwealth,
following
lemon
versus
kurtzman,
carefully
structured
the
act
which
you
are
considering
today,
structured
it
to
thrive
fully
and
faithfully
to
meet
every
standard
which
this
court
had
expressed
in
its
various
decisions
under
the
establishment
clause.
why,
in
a
effort
to
solve
a
two-fold
problem
which
simply
won't
go
away.
the
first
part
of
that
problem
having
been
described
by
the
attorney
general
just
now;
a
massive
public
problem
which
involves
the
total
fiscal,
the
economic
and
educational
crisis
that
the
commonwealth
today
does
face.
secondly,
the
severe
problem
of
thousands
of
pennsylvania
individual
parents,
broad
masses
of
parents
and
the
middle
income
group
and
including
the
lower
income
parents
in
pennsylvania
were
involved
in
a
problem
relating
to
law,
to
conscience
and
the
family
economy.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
12
such
parents
here
this
afternoon.
a
group
described
in
our
papers
as
jose
diaz
et
al.,
who
last
year
had
paid
a
tuition
at
a
protestant,
a
catholic,
a
jewish
or
a
non
sectarian
school.
they
are
members
of
a
numerous
group
in
pennsylvania
who
are
in
fact
truly
caught
in
a
three-sided
vice.
they
are
faced
with
the
compulsion
of
law
to
begin
with,
they
are
faced
with
the
fact
that
the
under
criminal
sanction
of
pennsylvania
compulsory
attendance
law
requires
them
to
have
their
children
in
some
school,
which
meets
reasonable
state
requirements.
they
are
also
under
legal
compulsion
of
course
to
do
what
they
have
always
been
doing,
they
are
all
tax
payers
and
paying
their
public
school
tax.
they
also
face
a
compulsion
for
conscience
which
impels
them
to
seek
other
education
for
their
children
and
thirdly,
they
are
faced
with
the
twin
effects
which
we
hardly
need
to
describe
further
today
of
inflation
and
taxation.
now,
how
does
act
92
seek
to
remedy
this
problem?
it
does
it
by
giving
un-earmarked
payments
to
people
whom
the
legislature
determine
to
have
special
need
because
they
carry
a
special
burden.
the
proof
of
that
burden,
the
general
assembly
found
to
be
best
selected
proof
of
their
carrying
of
this
burden
is
the
fact
that
they
had
in
fact
paid
a
tuition
at
a
non-public
school,
the
year
past.
now
court
below
looked
at
the
statute
and
found
it
unconstitutional.
the
court
below
said
that
this
statute,
first
of
all
it
said,
it
had
a
secular
legislative
purpose
and
that
wins
the
court's
tests.
it
then
looked
at
the
entanglement
problem
and
found
no
kind
of
entanglement
whatever
to
be
involved
in
this
statute.
what
it
did
at
least
grope
at
the
idea
that
the
statute
has
a
primary
effective
advancing
religion.
i
say
that
the
court
groped
at
it
because
as
you
read
the
opinion,
you
find
that
it's
hard
to
point
it
right
down
where
you
find
the
court
truly
talking
about
primacy
or
principle
character
of
the
fact
and
advancing
religion
rather
than
having
possibly
a
relationship
to
religion.
at
any
rate,
the
court
plays
what
we
will
be
willing
to
call
the
failure
of
the
act
to
meet
the
primary
effect
test
on
three
different
arguments.
the
first
that
the
parents
were
merely
a
conduit
under
the
act
that
they
are
merely
a
conduit
under
the
act
for
the
payment
of
public
funds
to
nonpublic
schools.
secondly,
it
was
possible
and
quite
likely
that
the
parents
were
going
to
use
the
money
they
got
under
these
payments
in
the
future,
fourth
payments,
to
sectarian
schools.
thirdly,
the
court
pointed
out
and
this
is
not
in
its
opinion,
but
appears
in
its
order,
its
final
order,
at
page
53
a
of
the
appendix,
pointed
out
that
or
stated
that
90%
of
the
children
attending
nonpublic
schools
in
pennsylvania
are
enrolled
in
schools
for
which
are
religious
in
character.
there
was
no
record
evidence
of
this,
but
this
was
the
court's
reasoning.
as
to
the
conduit
argument,
here
the
court
immediately
invoked
as
did
mr.
(inaudible)
this
morning
to
which
it
grant
cases
from
the
southern
states
allen
versus
day
(ph)
and
so
on
and
equated
the
arrangement
provided
by
the
act
with
the
situation
found
in
those
cases.
the
handling
to
a
parent
of
a
check
which
would
be
negotiable
only
at
an
institution
or
the
providing
of
a
parent
with
a
voucher
which
he
could
then
could
take
an
exchange
for
education
at
an
institution.
none
of
these
techniques
appear
in
this
act.
there
was
no
such
provision
under
act
92.
there
is
no
condition
whatever
attached
to
payment
under
this
act.
the
money
thus,
in
fact,
in
legal
fact,
become
that
of
the
parent.
it's
subject
to
his
own
limited
power
of
disposal.
the
money
becomes
his
private
money
and
regardless
of
what
hopes
the
state
public
policy
has
as
to
how
he
may
relieve
the
education
prices,
in
expending
this
tuition,
the
very
legal
fact
of
the
act
is
that
he
may
use
it
for
education
or
he
may
not.
he
need
not
under
the
terms
of
the
act
use
it
for
education.
no
institution
and
i
want
to
underscore
this
to
your
honors,
no
institution
has
a
breadth
of
legal
claim,
right
title
or
interest
in
one
set
of
the
money
in
question.
now
the
court
almost
as
though
it
felt
it
couldn't
make,
they
conduit
argument
stick,
invented
then
an
amazingly
vague
standard
for
constitutional
adjudication.
in
its
rule
of
possible
and
quite
likely,
the
court
said
this
that
the
act
offended
the
establishment
clause
and
now
i
quote
“a
possible
and
quite
likely
use
of
the
aid
under
review
is
to
enable
parents
to
continue
to
pay
tuition
at
sectarian
schools.”
this
rule
has
no
foundation
in
decisions
of
this
court.
it's
guess
work
perhaps
it's
intelligent
guess
work,
but
it
is
that.
it
certainly
does
not
measure
up
to
and
is
not
synonymous
with
or
any
privilege
of
the
clear
standard
which
this
court
stated
it
when
it
said
that
to
meet
the
strictures
of
the
establishment
clause
it
must
be
shown
that
an
enactment
does
not
have
a
primary
effect
advancing
religion.
thirdly,
on
the
matter
of
90%.
i
mentioned
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
record
of
evidence
at
all
on
the
90%
figure
respecting
children.
however,
it
also
must
be
considered
that
these
payments
go
to
individuals
and
the
law
controls
or
conditions
no
man's
choice
under
this
act,
the
choice
of
no
parent.
thirdly,
if
one
is
to
take
play
the
percentage
game,
i
think
we
begin
when
it's
like
problem
which
have
possibly
not
been
foreseen.
if
one
would
have
make
a
head
count
with
respect
to
who
is
getting
certain
welfare
benefits
or
who
is
benefiting
under
an
anti-poverty
program
and
then
determined
as
a
result
of
that
head
count
that
the
people
who
were
beneficiaries
were
90%
lax,
would
this
make
this
class
legislation.
we
have
just
enacted
a
perfectly
splendid
program,
and
immensely
humane
program
for
relief,
of
relief
through
expenditure
of
some
$135
million
of
tax
payer's
money
for
resettlement
in
israel
of
jewish
refugees
from
religious
persecution
in
the
soviet
union.
undoubtedly,
90%
of
these
individuals
are
of
a
single
religious
faith.
certainly,
this
cannot
be
taken
as
a
standard
for
invalidating
any
such
program.
what
we
have
here
and
we
believe
is
a
measure
which
in
no
ways
offends
the
establishment
clause.
we
have,
however,
raised
the
affirmative
defenses
as
your
honors
have
doubtless
noted
in
our
brief
and
from
the
record.
the
parents
in
this
case,
have
raised
affirmative
defenses
of
equal
protection
which
i
should
like
briefly
to
comment
upon.
i
should
point
out
at
the
offset
that
we
are
not
here
arguing
the
proposition
which
was
argued
for
in
brusca,
the
case
to
which
mr.
pfeffer
referred
this
morning,
where
parents
of
nonpublic
school,
children
asserted
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
participate
in
public
funds,
a
right
to
have
these
funds
devoted
to
nonpublic
education.
rather
here
a
statute
exists
and
that
statute
bears
un-earmarked
assistance
benefits
to
a
classic
parents
rationally
determined
and
without
conditions
attached.
i
would
like
to
talk
first
of
all
about
parents
who
are
described
in
the
papers,
and
in
our
briefs,
as
the
watson
parents.
mr.
&
mrs.
watson
have
a
daughter
ellen
who
attends
baldwin
school,
a
nonsectarian
school
in
pennsylvania.
they
are
express
beneficiaries
of
this
act.
they
are
parents
of
nonpublic
school
children
and
nonpublic
school
is
clearly
defined
in
the
act
in
a
measure
and
in
a
way
that
includes
a
nonsectarian
nonpublic
schools.
they
cannot
have
an
establishment
problem.
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
have
an
establishment
problem.
they
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
the
lower
court
and
the
court
denied
their
motion
on
a
peculiar
ground
that
although
they
were
--
had
been
granted
intervention
as
a
right.
court's
reasoning
was
they
--
that
the
plaintiff's
had
sought
no
relief
against
them.
later
the
order
of
the
court
was
to
state
that
90%
of
the
beneficiaries
of
this
act
being
the
parents
of
children
attending
sectarian
schools,
they
“undoubtedly
by
that
sought
provide
another
means
for
denying
these
individuals,
the
benefits
of
the
act.”
it's
perfectly
clear
that
to
cut
the
watsons
out
of
the
act
underground
that
they
are
minority
beneficiaries
under
the
court's
reasoning
would
certainly
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
to
say
that
they
were
not
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
act
directly
conflicts
with
what
the
legislature
itself
said
in
its
definition,
a
parents
of
nonpublic
schools.
the
second
group
of
beneficiaries
under
this
act
we're
here
to
speak
for
today,
are
mr.
&
mrs.
jose
diaz,
who
have
a
boy
jose
junior
in
st.
peter
apostle
school
in
philadelphia,
mr.
&
mrs.
kurtzman
whose
daughter,
debbi,
attends
redeemer
--
attended
redeemer
lutheran
school
and
he
is
now
attending
public
school.
here
incidentally,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
an
example
of
the
parent
who
is
eligible
today
for
the
benefit
of
the
act
on
account
of
the
fact
that
he
had,
had,
these
parents
had
had
their
children,
they
had
paid
a
tuition
for
their
children
in
a
school,
in
a
sectarian
school.
now
they
have
elected
high
school
time
as
coming,
they
are
electing
to
send
these
children
--
this
child
to
a
public
school.
another
pair
of
parents
are
mr.
&
mrs.
zorbits
(ph)
who
have
their
daughter
roselleth
at
jacob's
school.
now
these
people
have
been
told
by
the
court
that
they
may
not
participate
in
the
benefits
of
this
act.
the
court
below
said
that
these
latter
parents
cannot
be
paid
because
of
two
things.
first
of
all
they
had
antecedently
paid
out
of
their
own
pockets,
money
for
tuition
last
year.
secondly,
the
court
thinks
it's
likely
possible
and
quite
likely
that
in
another
year,
they
will
pay
another
tuition
to
maintain
that
child
in
a
sectarian
school
even
though,
as
we
have
said
the
payment
of
that
subsequent
tuition
is
absolutely,
certainly
a
payment
of
out
of
private
money.
therefore,
the
court
has
said
that
these
parents
must
be
excluded
from
a
public
welfare
benefit,
because
of
what?
because
they
exercised
an
act
of
the
will
whereby
yesterday
they
spent
their
own
money,
their
own
private
money
because
of
their
religion
and
tomorrow
for
the
same
reason,
they
may
again
expend
their
private
money.
a
person
certainly
may
not
be
excluded
from
a
program
of
public
welfare
benefits
because
of
his
race,
because
of
alienage
or
because
he
has
done
something
which
is
nothing
other
than
an
exercise
of
religious
choice.
finally
may
it
please
the
court,
the
appellees
have
devoted
some
time
and
much
bigger
in
speaking
of
political
entanglement
with
respect
to
this
act.
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
this
act
is
self
executing,
paid
for
out
of
the
cigarette
tax.
there
is
no
record.
the
court
below
in
no
way
discussed
any
such
issue
and
there
is
no
record
whatsoever
of
any
evidence
at
all
at
the
plaintiff
sought
to
introduce
below
on
this
issue,
referring
conceivably
to
leave
the
matter
to
supposition
to
guesswork.
in
conclusion,
may
i
say
to
the
court
that
a
secular
need
of
the
nation
is
today
in
a
growingly
socialized
society
for
people
to
be
reasonably
enabled
to
follow
conscientious
choices,
nowhere
is
this
more
important
than
with
respect
to
education,
especially
under
this
act
where
it
is
possible
that
a
such
choice
may
help
some
parents
to
rear
their
children
in
the
traditions
of
civility,
non-violence,
decency
and
morality
as
i
like
to
put.
mr.
william
bentley
ball
if
i
may.
mr.
william
bentley
ball
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.i
will
save
you
30
seconds
mr.
reath.
mr
mann
spoke
first
of
all
about
the
character
of
aided
activity.
the
aided
activity
here,
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
call
it
aided
activity
a
parochial
school.
the
aided
activity
here
is
an
act
of
will
of
the
parent.
i
don't
believe
the
bridge
was
crossed.
we
have
talked
about
conduit
throughout
this
case
but
nothing
that
mr
mann
said
in
spite
of
all
appeals,
the
questions
concerning
religious
controversy,
got
him
across
that
legal
point,
nothing
can
change
the
act.
the
act
in
fact
does
rack
money
to
individuals
who
have
total
disposition
over
that
money.
his
whole
case
depends
on
the
conduit
except
for
his
remarks
concerning
religious
divisiveness.
now
i
beg
the
court,
where
is
their
a
record
of
this.
it
is
fine
to
talk
about
what
no
historical
research
supports
the
founding
fathers
as
having
said.
but
we
have
to
live
in
today's
day.
when
we
look
at
the
record,
which
the
plaintiffs
could
have
made
below,
which
they
neglected
made
below,
where
was
the
religious
divisiveness?
does
it
consist
in
the
fact
that
some
people
decide
to
go
into
the
forum
and
make
a
religious
issue
out
of
something.
we
didn’t
even
have
it
in
spite
of
the
intervention
of
religious
groups
in
their
own
names
in
pennsylvania.
we
have
shown,
we
have
been
willing
to
show
that
the
record,
the
voting
record
was
on
both
sides
of
the
island
favor
of
this
act
and
opposed
to
this
act
that
jews,
protestants
and
catholics
voted
against
the
act,
voted
for
the
act.
there’s
absolutely
no
foundation
for
this
perfectly
luridness
charge
of
a
holy
war
going
out
in
pennsylvania.
the
g.i
bill
of
rights
is
perfectly
justified
in
the
same
way
that
this
act
is
justified.
certainly
people
could
have
made
a
religious
issue
out
of
it.
2000
people
were
educated
at
divinity
school
under
a
g
i
bill
of
rights
which
at
that
time
required
that
the
check
go
directly
to
the
school.
you
can't
violate
the
constitution
because
somebody
was
coming
back
from
war.
if
that
act
which
was
generally
accepted
just
as
the
pennsylvania
act
is
generally
accepted.
if
that
act
were
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
a
very
strange
thing
in
our
history,
it
was
broadly
accepted
just
as
this
act
is
being
broadly
accepted
today
among
the
people
of
the
state
in
real
life
in
actual
pennsylvania.
thank
you,
your
honors.
