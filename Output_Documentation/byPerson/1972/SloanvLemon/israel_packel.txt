mr.
israel
packel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
to
make
one
point
and
i
think
it's
controlling
point
and
that
is,
that
the
dominant
purpose
and
the
primary
effect
of
the
pennsylvania
act
is
economic
and
not
religious.
of
course,
i
realize
that
the
case
does
have
sociological
and
religious
collateral
effects,
but
i
say,
we
essentially,
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
economic
measure
by
the
commonwealth.
what
is
the
economic
situation
that
confronted
pennsylvania
here?
there
were
several
factors;
first
of
all
and
i,
of
course,
talking
about
education.
first
of
all,
in
our
schools
throughout
the
commonwealth
and
in
particularly
in
pennsylvania
there
was
a
serious
financial
situation.
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
two
serious
strikes
that
we
had
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
because
of
financial
problems.
secondly,
there
was
a
factor
that
20%
of
the
students
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
were
going
to
non-public
schools.
thirdly,
the
average
annual
cost
for
a
student
in
a
public
school
was
at
$980
per
year.
next
item
was
the
fact
that
many
of
the
non
public
schools
were
threatening,
there
was
a
present
danger
that
they
were
going
to
shift,
give
up
their
schools
and
the
students
would
be
all
be,
a
great
many
of
them
would
be
shifted
to
the
public
school.
and
the
fourth
significant
factor
is
the
obvious
one,
true
in
so
many
other
states,
pennsylvania
under
its
constitution
had
the
duty
to
make
provision
for
the
education
of
all
that
is
young.
now,
what
to
do?
how
to
cope
with
this
economic
situation?
the
legislature
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
thing
to
be
done
was
to
offer
to
parents
of
non-public
students
$75
if
they
were
in
the
elementary
school
or
$150
if
they
were
in
a
secondary
school.
in
effect,
pennsylvania
was
saying
to
these
parents,
look
folks,
if
we
have
your
students
here,
not
only
would
we
have
a
tremendous
capital
program
which
would
take
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
to
build
enough
schools,
but
if
you
continue
to
send
your
children
to
the
school
where
you
have
been
sending
them,
if
you
don't
switch
them,
we
would
be
saving
at
the
least
$980
and
to
induce
you
to
keep
doing
that
because
of
the
economic
plate
in
which
we
all
are,
we
will
pay
you
the
$150
or
$75
per
student.
it
was
purely
this
economic
measure,
it's
spelled
out
in
legislation,
the
general
assembly
made
it
crystal
clear
that
this
was
an
economic
motive
in
which
they
were
trying
to
cope
with
this
very,
very
serious
situation
before
them.
really,
i
think
in
the
analysis,
you
have
got
to
consider
this
very
high
function
of
this
court
to
say
that
legislation
of
a
state
is
unconstitutional
or
to
be
asserted
only
in
the
case
where
there
are
legitimate
ends
being
ought
to
be
achieved.
i
can't
help,
but
make
he
analogy,
it
may
be
a
little
far-fetched,
i
am
thinking
of
the
20s
and
the
earlier
period
when
we
had
the
situation
in
dealing
with
congressional
power,
where
the
court
would
say,
well,
you
may
have
the
power,
but
what
you
are
trying
to
do
with
this
statute,
it's
collateral
effects
are
something
different.
i
am
thinking
for
example,
the
pierce
and
labor
(ph)
case
or
the
cases
where
congress
purported,
attempted
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
and
this
court
use
to
say,
oh
well,
if
what
you
are
trying
to
accomplish,
if
you
are
trying
to
regulate
manufacturing
or
if
it
has
the
effect
of
regulating
manufacture,
we
don't
care
even
though
you
are
asserting
a
power
over
interstate
commerce.
similarly
i
say
here,
we
shouldn't
look
to
the
collateral
effect
where
the
legislature
is
clearly
asserting
a
legitimate
end.
here
in
the
pennsylvania
legislature
said,
we
are
trying
to
save
money
so
that
the
schools
as
we
are
trying,
one
will
be
conducted
properly,
sure
it
has
a
collateral
effect.
it
gives
some
benefit,
but
i
say,
look
at
the
main
object
that
what
the
legislation
is
trying
to
do
and
for
that
reason
this
legislation
should
be
held
constitutional.
