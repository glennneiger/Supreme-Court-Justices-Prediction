mr.
theodore
r.
mann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
express
my
deep
appreciation
to
the
court
for
having
found
sufficient
play
in
the
joints
of
the
first
amendment
to
have
accommodated
the
religious
sensibilities
of
several
of
us
by
extending
argument
to
3:30
today,
which
i
trust
is
not
a
violation
of
the
law
between
separation
in
church
and
state
and
i
will
try
to
repay
that
kindness
by
taking
considerably
less
than
my
full
time.
if
it
please
the
court,
it
is
our
judgment
the
act
92
is
unconstitutional
in
purpose,
in
effect
and
because
of
the
political
divisiveness
that
it
causes.
very
briefly,
it's
our
judgment
that
it
passes
none
of
the
standards
that
the
court
has
recently
set
forth.
i
will
take
just
a
moment
on
purpose.
i
am
of
course
well
aware
that
this
court
in
the
last
11
pennsylvania
case
found
that
the
legislative
purpose
must
be
accorded
appropriate
deference,
but
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
legislative
purpose
in
the
last
pennsylvania
statue,
a
statute
whereby
secular,
educational
services
were
being
purchased
by
the
state
was
to
enhance
and
“the
quality
of
the
secular
eduction
in
all
schools
covered
by
the
compulsory
attendance
law.“
now
clearly
the
state
has
a
comprehensive
and
pervasive
interest
in
advancing
the
quality
of
secular
eduction
in
all
schools
and
that
is
clearly
a
legitimate
public
purpose.
it's
not
the
same
purpose.
it's
nothing
like
the
purpose
set
forth
in
act
92.
act
92
purports
to
have
several
purposes.
several
that
are
secular
and
one
that
is
clearly
not
and
several
that
are
secular
or
foresees
that
it
aims
to
make
sure
that
our
public
school
classrooms
do
not
get
too
overcrowded
and
that
is
an
obviously
appropriate
purpose.
it
aims
to
keep
a
large
tax
load
and
additional
tax
load
off
the
back
of
the
public
in
pennsylvania
and
that
is
obviously
a
legitimate
purpose.
but
it
means
to
do
this
and
i
read
sirs
from
the
legislative
findings.
and
what
they
say
essentially
is
that
should
parents
of
children
now
enrolled
in
non
public
schools
be
forced
by
economic
circumstances
to
transfer
any
substantial
number
of
their
children
to
public
schools.
it
would
be
an
enormous
additional
burden
to
the
tax
payer
wherefore
that
in
order
to
reimburse
parents
partially
for
this
service
so
vitally
needed
by
the
commonwealth,
this
act
is
passed.
what
is
this
service
so
vitally
needed
by
the
commonwealth?
it
is
the
service
“performed
by
parents
in
sending
their
children
to
non
public
schools
which
in
the
maine
and
pennsylvania
are
sectarian
schools.”
so
that
the
state
through
the
payment
of
money
undertakes
and
in
the
purpose
sets
forth
that
that's
what
it's
intention
is.
undertakes
to
encourage
parents
to
keep
their
children
in
the
parochial
school
so
that
they
will
not
overcrowd
the
public
schools
and
i
submit
that
in
the
evolving
standards
and
this
court
has
said
recently
that
these
standards
are
evolving,
that
this
court
might
now
adopt
the
definition
of
primary
purpose
used
by
justice
frankfurter
concurring
with
justice
harlan
in
the
mcgowan
case
and
what
he
said
there
was
that
if
the
primary
end
achieved
by
a
form
of
regulation
is
the
affirmation
or
promotion
of
religious
doctrine,
primary
in
the
sense
that
all
secular
ends
which
it
purportedly
serves
are
derivative
from
and
not
wholly
independent
of
the
advancement
of
religion,
then
the
regulation
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
and
i
submit
that
whatever
proper
secular
purposes
are
found
in
the
legislative
findings
are
entirely
derivative
from
the
improper
sectarian
purpose
set
forth
in
the
legislative
findings
to
which
i
have
referred.
and
of
course
to
the
second
portion
of
our
argument,
we
say
that
this
legislation
is
unconstitutional
in
effect.
first
of
all
because
to
the
extent
that
it
effectuates
its
invalid
purpose
of
course
it's
unconstitutional.
appellants
argue
and
all
of
them
have
argued
that
since
the
money
does
not
go
to
the
school
treasury,
but
rather
to
the
parents
that
this
makes
a
difference
and
we
hold
with
professor
freund
when
he
said,
“the
sharp
dichotomy
between
pupil
benefit
and
benefit
to
the
school
seems
to
me
a
chimerical
constitutional
criteria
and
chimerical
indeed
because
the
question
of
whether
the
money
goes
to
the
church
or
to
the
parent
should
not
be
and
i
don't
even
has
been
the
focal
point
of
inquiry
when
what
we
are
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
a
legislative
scheme
has
a
primary
effective
advancing
religion.”
religion
not
a
church
and
the
first
amendment
talks
about
religion
not
a
church.
of
course
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
the
everson
case
sir
is
probably
the
only
exception
to
the
analysis
i
was
about
to
make.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
and
with
your
honors'
permissions
because
i
think
it's
quite
distinguishable,
that
in
tilton
versus
richardson
of
course,
this
court
made
clear
to
all
of
us
that
indeed
a
state
can
provide
money
directly
to
a
church
institution,
so
provided
that
the
propose
is
proper.
in
the
end
to
determine
whether
the
primary
effect
of
a
law
advances
religion,
what
must
be
examined
is
the
character
of
the
aided
activity,
that's
what
the
lower
court
said
and
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
if
we
examine
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
in
the
recent
cases
decided
by
this
court,
whether
it
is
secular
text
books
you
know
provided
to
parochial
school
or
adding,
giving
15%
salary
supplement
to
secular
teachers
in
religious
schools
or
whether
the
state
is
purchasing
secular
subjects
in
math
and
science
and
foreign
language
from
the
parochial
schools,
in
every
case
except
for
everson,
which
i
will
come
to
in
just
a
moment,
in
every
case
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
is
primary
secular
education.
in
every
case
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
is
ideologically
neutral.
here
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
legislative
scheme
which
is
reimbursing
general
tuition
to
parochial
education
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
argue
with
the
point
that
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
is
parochial
eduction
which
this
court
has
defined0
in
lemon
the
sense
of
this
court
said
the
various
characteristics
of
the
schools
make
them
a
powerful
vehicle
for
transmitting
the
catholic
faith
to
the
next
generation
in
the
case
of
jewish
parochial
schools
or
lutheran
parochial
schools,
the
identical
thing
could
be
said
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“in
short
parochial
schools
involve
substantial
religious
activity
and
purpose.”
so
that
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
under
act
92
is
religious
activity
and
therefore
it
is
invalid.
the
only
exception
i
think
to
that
kind
of
analysis
is
everson,
because
i
think
in
everson
although
the
bus
ride
is
ideologically
neutral,
it
can
i
think
more
accurately
be
said
that
the
effect
of
reimbursing
parents
for
transporting
their
children
to
parochial
schools
comes
closer
to
being
the
primary
effect
which
aids
religion
in
any
of
these
other
more
recent
cases
that
i
noted.
but
everson
is
distinguishable
not
only
because
the
bus
ride
is
non
ideological,
it's
distinguishable
too
because
there
is
a
very
finite
point,
a
bus
ride
in
terms
of
a
parochial
school's
budget
can
never
account
for
more
than
a
small
fraction
and
if
the
legislative
scheme
is
played
out
to
the
end,
it
has
--
it
comes
to
an
end
and
it
comes
to
an
end
early.
when
we
are
talking
about
reimbursing
tuition,
we
are
talking
about
reimbursing
the
total
cost
really
of
operating
the
parochial
school.
there
is
no
end,
if
this
act
constitutional
then
why
not
five
times
the
amount.
but
the
--
let
me
just
close
this
portion
of
the
argument
by
saying
that
it's
clear
to
me
that
the
state
has
no
more
power
to
help
a
parent
give
his
child
a
sectarian
education
than
it
has
to
give
--
to
help
a
church
give
the
children
of
its
parishioners
a
parochial
education
because
it's
not
a
church
which
the
first
amendment
forbids
from
being
aided
its
religion.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes
they
did
and
i
think
the
court
was
absolutely
correct.
if
a
legislative
scheme
has
an
incidental
effect,
such
as
your
honor
has
described,
that
in
itself
is,
i
think
what
we
are
really
dealing
with
is
the
definition
of
primary
effect.
the
primary
purpose
of
this
legislation,
however,
is
to
achieve
all
of
its
ends
through
purposely
encouraging
as
many
as
parents
as
possible
to
keep
all
of
their
children
in
the
parochial
schools,
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying,
well,
just
because
a
piece
of
legislation
might
have
an
incidental
effect
of
encouraging
somebody.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
think
it's
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
i
must
say,
the
statistics
i
read
don't,
i
think
indicate
that
the
overcrowded
conditions
of
the
public
schools
are
improving
quite
their
own
with
that
respect
of
this
problem
in
the
last
several
years,
but
i
think
they
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
what
the
legislature
is
trying
to
do
is
not
get
the
schools
overcrowded
like
encouraging,
purposely
encouraging
parents,
not
incidentally,
purposely
that's
on
bases
of
the
scheme
to
give
their
kids,
continue
to
give
their
kids
a
sectarian
education
and
if
that
isn't
violative
of
the
first
amendment,
i
don't
know
what
is?
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes
the
matter
of
fact
it's
true
that
the
states
--
if
a
100%
of
the
children
went
to
non-sectarian
private
schools,
the
state's
purpose
would
be
accomplished
in
the
same
way,
that
is
absolutely
correct
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
hear
that?
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
in
terms
of
whether
it
passes
constitutional
muster
on
the
primary
effect
test,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
50%
of
the
kids
are
going
to
private
non-sectarian
and
50%
to
private
sectarian
or
whatever
the
percentage
is,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
in
terms
of
passing
constitutional
muster
on
the
third
test
that
has
been
announced
by
the
court,
the
question
of
political
divisiveness
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
few
moments,
i
think
it
makes
all
of
the
difference
in
the
world.
one
of
the
arguments
that
mr.
ball
has
made
is
that
--
all
of
the
appellants
have
made
and
we
have
heard
it
all
day
to
day
is
that
there
are
some
how
a
difference
here
because
the
parents
are
getting
the
money
at
the
end
of
the
school
year
and
they
may
spend
it
for
a
vacation
or
for
a
down
payment
on
a
car
anyway
they
want
and
it's
just
like
another,
so
the
argument
goes
it's
just
like
any
other
general
purpose,
general
welfare
legislation.
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
directory,
before
i
do
i
want
to
address
my
self
to
it
factually
because
i
believe
it
is
factually
incorrect,
although
none
of
us,
myself
included
have
made
this
point
in
our
briefs.
this
is
not
a
true
tuition
reimbursement
law.
if
your
honors
will
look
the
appendix,
pages
60-61,
which
contains
the
act,
it
says
that
to
become
eligible,
to
receive
this
reimbursement,
$150
for
a
high
school
child,
$75
for
an
elementary
school
child,
the
parent
must
produce
and
show
to
the
authority
a
receipted
tuition
bill
or
a
copy
of
an
executed
contract,
under
which
the
student
attended
the
public
--
non-public
school
and
in
the
next
paragraph
when
it
talks
about
receiving
the
money,
the
amount
a
parent
receives,
apparently
receives
the
less
of
$150
or
“the
actual
amount
of
tuition
paid
or
contracted
to
be
paid
by
a
parent.”
so
let's
understand
the
legislative
scheme.
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
a
parent
to
have
paid
this
tuition
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
year
get
it
back
from
the
state.
the
parent
need
only
execute
a
contract
at
the
begging
of
the
school
year,
at
the
end
of
the
school
year,
he
must
only
show
the
contract
and
upon
showing
the
contract,
he
gets
his
$150
and
he
may
or
may
not,
pay
is
overdue
tuition
bill,
but
i
wouldn't
want
this
case
to
go
off
on
factual
difference.
but
i
wanted
to
make
the
point,
because
it
seem
clear
to
me
that
even
this
was
true
tuition
reimbursement
bill,
it
isn't
so
much
the
receipt
of
money
by
your
parent
or
last
year's
attendance,
which
encourages
that
parent
to
send
us
child
to
parochial
school
next
year.
indeed
in
the
case
of
a
high
school
senior
at
a
parochial
school
that's
not
so
at
all.
the
parent
gets
the
money
for
the
12th
grade
at
the
end
of
12th
grade
and
he
is
not
going
to
use
the
parochial
education
of
his
child.
it
seems
to
me
that,
that's
not
pertinent.
it
is
in
fact
a
promise
of
reimbursement
made
by
the
state
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
when
the
parent
is
deciding
whether
to
go
to
a
--
send
his
child
to
a
public
or
parochial
school,
it's
through
that
promise,
the
statutory
promise
by
which
pennsylvania
is
encouraging
parents
to
send
or
to
continue
to
send
their
children
to
non-public
schools
which
in
the
maine
and
pennsylvania
are
sectarians
schools.
this
is
nothing
like
general
welfare
legislation.
of
course,
of
the
recipient
of
a
social
security
to
check
and
decide
to
use
it
send
his
grandchild
to
parochial
school.
the
recipient
of
an
employment
compensation
check
can
turn
it
over
to
his
parish
priest.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes
sir,
by
all
means,
by
all
means.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
clearly
here
we
have
the
state
may
be
paying
the
entire
tuition
because
if
it's
less
than
a
150
–
the
entire
tuition
is
a
$150,
the
child
gets
a
$150.
i
understood
your
honor
to
be
asking
the
question
what
if
the
statute
said,
never
more
than
half
the
tuition
and
made
a
legislative
finding
that
at
least
half
of
the
budget
of
the
parochial
school
is
spent
for
secular
educational
parochial.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
my
argument
remain
the
same,
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes,
sir
it
makes
no
difference
at
all.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
am
not
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
am
so
much
in
trouble
[laughter]
as
you
know
any
attempt
sir,
it
will
take
all
of
the
court's
previous
decisions
and
apply
them
in
a
symmetrical
way
to
every
church
state
case
that
comes
before
the
court,
is
going
to
meet
with
some
trouble
and
i
will
grant
justice
white
that,
but
i
think
the
everson
case
gives
me
some
problems,
it
gave
the
court
problems
and
as
i
understand
it
some
of
those
who
voted
in
favor
of
it
that
now
sit
on
this
court
have
indicated
if
they
had
to
do
it
over
again,
they
wouldn't.
point
of
the
matter
of
course
is
that
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
the
lemon
dissent
so
case
said
that,
everson,
a
decision
which
was
thought
to
take
us
to
the
verge
of
constitutional
permissibility
really
began
us
what
might
be
a
downhill
thrust
and
as
i
understood
that
context
in
which
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
was
talking
in
that
case,
it
was
an
effort
to
say,
we
got
to
be
careful
in
each
decision
as
to
where
it's
going
to
lead
us.
in
everson,
i
think
led
the
court,
led
the
society
into
a
great
many
legislative
schemes
that
have
had
to
pass
constitutional
muster
or
fail
to
pass
constitutional
muster
before
this
court
before.
i
was
making
the
point
just
a
moment
ago
that
the
difference
between
the
fellow
who
gets
his
unemployment
compensation
check
and
turns
it
over
to
his
church
and
the
parent
who
gets
reimbursement
here
is
that
that
fellow
who
gets
his
unemployment
compensation
check
didn't
get
it
because
he
performed
some
religious
act
or
did
something
that
advanced
religion.
he
got
it
for
entirely
different
reasons
and
he
is
free
to
use
as
he
will,
but
judge
lord
in
the
lower
court
here
i
think
was
precisely
correct
when
he
defined
this
issue
by
saying,
“it
is
whether
individuals
may
receive
state
funds
solely
because
they
have
paid
tuition
at
a
church
related
school.”
if
i
may
paraphrase
what
the
court
said
in
lemon
dissent
sir.
“if
rhode
island
may
not
supplement
teachers'
salaries
without
being
certain
that
those
teachers
do
not
teach
religion
then
it
seems
to
me
a
fortiori
that
pennsylvania
may
not
reimburse
tuition
to
parochial
school
parents
when
they
are
absolutely
certain
that,
that
tuition
is
being
used
to
advance
or
teach
religion.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
what
i
reminded
of
sir
is
some
of
the
court's
opinions
or
concurring
opinions
or
dissenting
opinions,
i
do
not
remember
now
which,
years
ago
we
used
to
cite
bible
reading
in
the
public
schools
which
had
not
yet
been
declared
unconstitutional
as
saying
well
how
about
bible
reading
of
the
public
schools.
we
have
been
doing
back
for
a
years,
so
it
does
not
it
justify
the
next
process
and
of
course
when
bible
reading
in
the
public
schools
finally
came
before
the
court
it
was
unanimously
declared
unconstitutional.
i
only
make
that
point
to
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
gi
bill
of
rights,
has
ever
come
before
this
or
any
other
court
on
first
amendment
grounds.
i
am
not
suggesting
which
way
it
should
go
if
it
should
come
here
and
i
hope
it
does
not
come
here,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
and
by
the
way
that
is
saying
something
significant
too.
i
think
that
since
the
gi
bill
has
been
in
affect
for
so
many,
many,
many
years
and
nobody
has
ever
challenged
it,
indicates
that
it's
something
that
the
society
has
fully
accepted
and
will
not
and
would
never
caused
the
political
divisiveness
that
some
other
types
of
legislation
will,
such
as
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
take,
there
are
distinctions
of
course,
but
to
take
the
kind
of
statute
that
a
nation
passes
after
a
war
in
which
it
feels
it
owe
so
much
to
those
people
who
fought
the
war
for
them
and
say
we
are
going
to
repay
this
by
making
your
education
possible,
here
is
the
money,
spend
it
anyway
you
will,
but
for
education
per
se,
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
is
not
precedent
for
anything
that
we
have
before
for
anything
that
we
have
before
the
court
today.
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
well,
i
have
reach
the
point
in
my
argument
and
if
i
may,
it
is
the
last
point
in
my
argument,
it
is
political
entanglement
and
i
want
to
spend
a
few
moments
on
it
with
the
court's
permission
and
i
will
close.
if
this
legislation
were
validated,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
that
fears
expressed
by
the
founding
fathers
and
justices
of
this
court
justice
after
justice
of
divisiveness
along
religious
lines,
sect
again
sect,
each
sect
attempting
to
use
whatever
political
muscle
it
can
garner
to
get
its
fair
share
of
the
pie,
deal
making
between
sects
in
order
to
get
that
muscle,
all
of
those
spheres
it
seems
to
me
realistically
would
spring
back
to
life
again.
and
our
political
process
would
be
corrupted
and
i
submit
our
religions
would
be
demeaned.
mr.
ball
has
said
in
his
reply
brief
that
that
is
a
constitutionally
malevolent
argument
that
to
permit
blacks
and
other
groups
within
the
society
to
seek
financial
aid
of
various
sorts
for
various
reasons
but
not
permit
parochial
school
advocates
to
do
the
same
thing
is
constitutionally
malevolent.
and
i
suppose
that
it's
true
that
every
effort
by
any
group
in
the
society
to
attain
funding
is
opposed
in
a
society
as
large
as
ours
by
some
other
group
and
to
that
degree
it's
of
course
divisive,
but
mr.
chief
justice
berger
made
it
abundantly
clear
in
lemon
dissent
so
that
the
attempt
to
obtain
funding
for
religious
purposes
has
always
been
meaner,
has
always
been
divisive
and
is
likely
to
strain
a
society
like
ours
to
the
breaking
point
and
that
is
why
in
schempp
this
court
said
the
very
purpose
of
a
bill
of
rights
was
to
withdraw
certain
subjects
from
the
divestitutes
of
political
controversy,
religion
being
one
of
them,0
they
depend
on
the
outcome
of
no
elections
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
religious
freedom
was
first
in
the
bill
of
rights
because
it
was
first
in
the
forefathers'
mind
and
it
was
set
forth
in
absolute
terms
and
it
is
strength
is
its
rigidity.
so
when
the
appellants
are
offended
by
political
divisiveness
argument
their
quarrel
is
not
with
me
and
is
not
with
the
court,
it
is
with
the
very
underpinnings
of
the
first
amendment
and
i
take
it
we
do
not
have
before
us
today
the
question
of
whether
we
don't
deal
or
we
deal.
the
point
is
if
i
may
for
just
a
moment,
it
is
difficult
to
talk
about
a
little
–
even
a
little
history
before
this
court
which
has
expressed
so
much
honor,
the
point
is
that,
that
we
were
an
enormously
diverse
people
in
the
first
place
and
that
is
why
we
made
the
separation
experiment
and
europe
did
not
it,
it
was
an
american
experiment
because
you
know
it
strikes
me
of
the
thomas
jefferson,
james
madison,
they
weren't
the
only
two
gentleman
who
understood
in
their
bones
that
when
the
power
of
religion,
when
religion
is
backed
by
the
power
of
government,
that
it
corrodes
both
processes,
government
and
religion.
the
european
contemporaries
must
have
known
it
better
than
they,
but
they
did
not
experiment
with
separation.
we
did
and
why
did
we
because
we
were
nation
building
and
we
were
building
a
nation
of
diverse
religions
and
ethnic
groups
and
it
is
not
a
question
of
ancient
history
as
mr.
ball
implied
in
his
brief.
mr.
brennan,
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
his
separate
schempp
opinion
that
our
religious
composition
in
this
country
today
is
far
more
the
diverse
than
it
was
several
hundred
years
ago
and
i
think
that
the
point
must
be
made
that
there
is
an
enormous
unity
that
--
and
here
as
in
european
society
which
for
1000
or
2000
years
has
shared
a
common
soil,
developed
a
common
language
undergoing
common
terrible
trauma,
a
unity
that
we
did
not
have
two
hundred
years
ago
which
i
suggest
contemporary
events
can
lead
us
all
to
believe
we
still
do
not
have.
so
perhaps
europe
would
survive
the
strains
of
establishment,
but
we
could
not.
the
judgment
was
made
by
the
forefathers
that
we
could
not
and
that
is
why
--
that
is
what
i
think
justice
frankfurter
was
saying
in
mcgowan
when
he
said
the
great
american
principle
of
eternal
separation
is
one
of
the
vital
reliances
of
our
system
for
assuring
unities
then
our
diversities.
given
and
already
at
--
well,
let
me
conclude.
this
legislation,
act
92,
i
do
not
understand
distinction
between
this
situation
in
wolman
versus
essex.
i
do
not
understand
this
argument
about
annual
appropriations
because
there
really
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
this
law
that
identical
it
validated
would
come
up
year
after
year,
not
in
some
administrative
body
where
after
all
there
isn't
much
entanglement,
but
in
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
where
there
is
a
great
deal,
there
is
no
reasoning
in
the
world
to
believe
that
a
$150
for
a
high
school
child
and
75
is
the
end
of
road.
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
berger
noted
in
lemon
v.
dicenso
about
that
pennsylvania
law,
lemon
versus
kurtzman
about
that
pennsylvania
law
passed
in
1968
that
under
it
$5
million
a
year
went
to
parochial
--
to
non-public
schools,
most
of
which
were
parochial.
i
call
to
your
honor's
attention
that
that
law
was
invalidated
in
june
of
1971.
that
this
law
was
passed
less
than
two
months
later
that
attorney
general
packel
has
nodded
in
his
brief
that
under
this
law
up
to
$75
million
will
be
paid
to
parents
of
non-public
school
children.
a
15-fold
increase
in
several
years
reminds
me
of
mr.
chief
justice
berger's
comments
in
waltz
that
if
tax
exemption
can
be
seen
as
the
first
step
in
the
establishment
of
religion
then
the
second
step
has
been
long
in
coming,
that
may
very
well
be
in
respect
of
tax
exemption,
it
most
certainly
is
not
in
respective
aid
to
sectarian
education.
the
second
step
came
within
two
months
and
it
was
a
15-fold
increase.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
am
not
sure
sir,
the
attorney
general
does
know?[laughter]
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
77%
balance,
i
do
not
go
where
it
goes
for
other
purposes
and
i
do
not
know
what
they
are.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
believe
--
i
cannot
answer
that
because
i
believe,
but
i
am
not
certain
that
the
1968
law
that
was
invalidated
by
this
court
was
initially
funded
through
the
harness
raising
receipts
and
then
was
funded
by
the
cigarette
tax
which
i
think
was
increased
for
that
purpose,
but
i
am
really
not
certain
and
i
am
not
helping
the
court
by
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
think
there
was
but
i
am
not
sure
i
am
sorry.
i
want
to
simply
say
this
on
political
entanglement
and
then
i
will
sit
down.
in
the
lower
court
i
was
joined
by
amici
who
joined
in
my
brief,
many,
one
of
them
was
the
state
counsel
of
churches
which
is
organized,
mostly
organized
protestants
in
pennsylvania,
and
another
was
pennsylvania
jewish
community
relations
conference
which
is
the
most
of
the
organized
jury
in
pennsylvania
and
i
asked,
to
ask
myself,
take
product
--
the
bitter,
angry,
and
frustrated
when
legislation
like
this
comes
up
for
consideration
and
is
indeed
passed.
this
legislation
represents
an
enormous
change
if
i
may
say
at
this
way
in
the
rules
of
the
game
after
one
side
has
committed
itself
to
the
old
rules
and
has
changed
its
position
irretrievably,
by
that
i
mean
that
it
is
a
130
years
ago,
when
every
state
in
the
union
already
had
as
part
of
its
fundamental
law
that
the
state
could
not
support
sectarian
education.
all
those
cards
were
on
the
table,
everybody
knew
that
and
at
that
point
in
time
protestant
america
decided
to
let
its
religious
schools
become
public
schools.
catholic
america
decided
to
start
on
the
process
of
building
the
great
and
complex
parochial
school
system
that
it
has
today.
for
the
government
to
come
along
a
130
years
later
and
say
now
we
are
going
to
begin
funding
sectarian
education
is
it
seems
to
me
the
grossest
kind
of
interference
of
government
in
the
competition
between
queens
which
justice
douglas
and
zorach
said
that
in
that
competition
between
these,
the
government
must
be
absolutely
neutral.
this
is
isn’t
some
peripheral
thing
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
parochial
education
which
this
court
has
set
and
which
many
educators
has
set,
is
singularly
the
most
effective
way
of
passing
on
a
religious
heritage
from
one
generation
to
another,
where
the
states
have
come
along
and
begin
to
support
only
those
religions
and
there
are
a
number
of
them
which
have
parochial
schools,
but
none
of
the
religions
and
this
is
most
of
them
which
do
not
have
parochial
school
is
laying
the
heavy
hand
of
government
on
that
competition
and
for
that
reason
will
cause
enormous
and
has
caused
enormous
divisiveness.
for
all
of
these
reasons
i
respectfully
request
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
express
my
deep
appreciation
to
the
court
for
having
found
sufficient
play
in
the
joints
of
the
first
amendment
to
have
accommodated
the
religious
sensibilities
of
several
of
us
by
extending
argument
to
3:30
today,
which
i
trust
is
not
a
violation
of
the
law
between
separation
in
church
and
state
and
i
will
try
to
repay
that
kindness
by
taking
considerably
less
than
my
full
time.
if
it
please
the
court,
it
is
our
judgment
the
act
92
is
unconstitutional
in
purpose,
in
effect
and
because
of
the
political
divisiveness
that
it
causes.
very
briefly,
it's
our
judgment
that
it
passes
none
of
the
standards
that
the
court
has
recently
set
forth.
i
will
take
just
a
moment
on
purpose.
i
am
of
course
well
aware
that
this
court
in
the
last
11
pennsylvania
case
found
that
the
legislative
purpose
must
be
accorded
appropriate
deference,
but
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
legislative
purpose
in
the
last
pennsylvania
statue,
a
statute
whereby
secular,
educational
services
were
being
purchased
by
the
state
was
to
enhance
and
“the
quality
of
the
secular
eduction
in
all
schools
covered
by
the
compulsory
attendance
law.“
now
clearly
the
state
has
a
comprehensive
and
pervasive
interest
in
advancing
the
quality
of
secular
eduction
in
all
schools
and
that
is
clearly
a
legitimate
public
purpose.
it's
not
the
same
purpose.
it's
nothing
like
the
purpose
set
forth
in
act
92.
act
92
purports
to
have
several
purposes.
several
that
are
secular
and
one
that
is
clearly
not
and
several
that
are
secular
or
foresees
that
it
aims
to
make
sure
that
our
public
school
classrooms
do
not
get
too
overcrowded
and
that
is
an
obviously
appropriate
purpose.
it
aims
to
keep
a
large
tax
load
and
additional
tax
load
off
the
back
of
the
public
in
pennsylvania
and
that
is
obviously
a
legitimate
purpose.
but
it
means
to
do
this
and
i
read
sirs
from
the
legislative
findings.
and
what
they
say
essentially
is
that
should
parents
of
children
now
enrolled
in
non
public
schools
be
forced
by
economic
circumstances
to
transfer
any
substantial
number
of
their
children
to
public
schools.
it
would
be
an
enormous
additional
burden
to
the
tax
payer
wherefore
that
in
order
to
reimburse
parents
partially
for
this
service
so
vitally
needed
by
the
commonwealth,
this
act
is
passed.
what
is
this
service
so
vitally
needed
by
the
commonwealth?
it
is
the
service
“performed
by
parents
in
sending
their
children
to
non
public
schools
which
in
the
maine
and
pennsylvania
are
sectarian
schools.”
so
that
the
state
through
the
payment
of
money
undertakes
and
in
the
purpose
sets
forth
that
that's
what
it's
intention
is.
undertakes
to
encourage
parents
to
keep
their
children
in
the
parochial
school
so
that
they
will
not
overcrowd
the
public
schools
and
i
submit
that
in
the
evolving
standards
and
this
court
has
said
recently
that
these
standards
are
evolving,
that
this
court
might
now
adopt
the
definition
of
primary
purpose
used
by
justice
frankfurter
concurring
with
justice
harlan
in
the
mcgowan
case
and
what
he
said
there
was
that
if
the
primary
end
achieved
by
a
form
of
regulation
is
the
affirmation
or
promotion
of
religious
doctrine,
primary
in
the
sense
that
all
secular
ends
which
it
purportedly
serves
are
derivative
from
and
not
wholly
independent
of
the
advancement
of
religion,
then
the
regulation
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
and
i
submit
that
whatever
proper
secular
purposes
are
found
in
the
legislative
findings
are
entirely
derivative
from
the
improper
sectarian
purpose
set
forth
in
the
legislative
findings
to
which
i
have
referred.
and
of
course
to
the
second
portion
of
our
argument,
we
say
that
this
legislation
is
unconstitutional
in
effect.
first
of
all
because
to
the
extent
that
it
effectuates
its
invalid
purpose
of
course
it's
unconstitutional.
appellants
argue
and
all
of
them
have
argued
that
since
the
money
does
not
go
to
the
school
treasury,
but
rather
to
the
parents
that
this
makes
a
difference
and
we
hold
with
professor
freund
when
he
said,
“the
sharp
dichotomy
between
pupil
benefit
and
benefit
to
the
school
seems
to
me
a
chimerical
constitutional
criteria
and
chimerical
indeed
because
the
question
of
whether
the
money
goes
to
the
church
or
to
the
parent
should
not
be
and
i
don't
even
has
been
the
focal
point
of
inquiry
when
what
we
are
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
a
legislative
scheme
has
a
primary
effective
advancing
religion.”
religion
not
a
church
and
the
first
amendment
talks
about
religion
not
a
church.
of
course
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
the
everson
case
sir
is
probably
the
only
exception
to
the
analysis
i
was
about
to
make.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
and
with
your
honors'
permissions
because
i
think
it's
quite
distinguishable,
that
in
tilton
versus
richardson
of
course,
this
court
made
clear
to
all
of
us
that
indeed
a
state
can
provide
money
directly
to
a
church
institution,
so
provided
that
the
propose
is
proper.
in
the
end
to
determine
whether
the
primary
effect
of
a
law
advances
religion,
what
must
be
examined
is
the
character
of
the
aided
activity,
that's
what
the
lower
court
said
and
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
if
we
examine
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
in
the
recent
cases
decided
by
this
court,
whether
it
is
secular
text
books
you
know
provided
to
parochial
school
or
adding,
giving
15%
salary
supplement
to
secular
teachers
in
religious
schools
or
whether
the
state
is
purchasing
secular
subjects
in
math
and
science
and
foreign
language
from
the
parochial
schools,
in
every
case
except
for
everson,
which
i
will
come
to
in
just
a
moment,
in
every
case
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
is
primary
secular
education.
in
every
case
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
is
ideologically
neutral.
here
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
legislative
scheme
which
is
reimbursing
general
tuition
to
parochial
education
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
argue
with
the
point
that
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
is
parochial
eduction
which
this
court
has
defined0
in
lemon
the
sense
of
this
court
said
the
various
characteristics
of
the
schools
make
them
a
powerful
vehicle
for
transmitting
the
catholic
faith
to
the
next
generation
in
the
case
of
jewish
parochial
schools
or
lutheran
parochial
schools,
the
identical
thing
could
be
said
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“in
short
parochial
schools
involve
substantial
religious
activity
and
purpose.”
so
that
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
under
act
92
is
religious
activity
and
therefore
it
is
invalid.
the
only
exception
i
think
to
that
kind
of
analysis
is
everson,
because
i
think
in
everson
although
the
bus
ride
is
ideologically
neutral,
it
can
i
think
more
accurately
be
said
that
the
effect
of
reimbursing
parents
for
transporting
their
children
to
parochial
schools
comes
closer
to
being
the
primary
effect
which
aids
religion
in
any
of
these
other
more
recent
cases
that
i
noted.
but
everson
is
distinguishable
not
only
because
the
bus
ride
is
non
ideological,
it's
distinguishable
too
because
there
is
a
very
finite
point,
a
bus
ride
in
terms
of
a
parochial
school's
budget
can
never
account
for
more
than
a
small
fraction
and
if
the
legislative
scheme
is
played
out
to
the
end,
it
has
--
it
comes
to
an
end
and
it
comes
to
an
end
early.
when
we
are
talking
about
reimbursing
tuition,
we
are
talking
about
reimbursing
the
total
cost
really
of
operating
the
parochial
school.
there
is
no
end,
if
this
act
constitutional
then
why
not
five
times
the
amount.
but
the
--
let
me
just
close
this
portion
of
the
argument
by
saying
that
it's
clear
to
me
that
the
state
has
no
more
power
to
help
a
parent
give
his
child
a
sectarian
education
than
it
has
to
give
--
to
help
a
church
give
the
children
of
its
parishioners
a
parochial
education
because
it's
not
a
church
which
the
first
amendment
forbids
from
being
aided
its
religion.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes
they
did
and
i
think
the
court
was
absolutely
correct.
if
a
legislative
scheme
has
an
incidental
effect,
such
as
your
honor
has
described,
that
in
itself
is,
i
think
what
we
are
really
dealing
with
is
the
definition
of
primary
effect.
the
primary
purpose
of
this
legislation,
however,
is
to
achieve
all
of
its
ends
through
purposely
encouraging
as
many
as
parents
as
possible
to
keep
all
of
their
children
in
the
parochial
schools,
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying,
well,
just
because
a
piece
of
legislation
might
have
an
incidental
effect
of
encouraging
somebody.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
think
it's
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
i
must
say,
the
statistics
i
read
don't,
i
think
indicate
that
the
overcrowded
conditions
of
the
public
schools
are
improving
quite
their
own
with
that
respect
of
this
problem
in
the
last
several
years,
but
i
think
they
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
what
the
legislature
is
trying
to
do
is
not
get
the
schools
overcrowded
like
encouraging,
purposely
encouraging
parents,
not
incidentally,
purposely
that's
on
bases
of
the
scheme
to
give
their
kids,
continue
to
give
their
kids
a
sectarian
education
and
if
that
isn't
violative
of
the
first
amendment,
i
don't
know
what
is?
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes
the
matter
of
fact
it's
true
that
the
states
--
if
a
100%
of
the
children
went
to
non-sectarian
private
schools,
the
state's
purpose
would
be
accomplished
in
the
same
way,
that
is
absolutely
correct
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
hear
that?
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
in
terms
of
whether
it
passes
constitutional
muster
on
the
primary
effect
test,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
50%
of
the
kids
are
going
to
private
non-sectarian
and
50%
to
private
sectarian
or
whatever
the
percentage
is,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
in
terms
of
passing
constitutional
muster
on
the
third
test
that
has
been
announced
by
the
court,
the
question
of
political
divisiveness
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
few
moments,
i
think
it
makes
all
of
the
difference
in
the
world.
one
of
the
arguments
that
mr.
ball
has
made
is
that
--
all
of
the
appellants
have
made
and
we
have
heard
it
all
day
to
day
is
that
there
are
some
how
a
difference
here
because
the
parents
are
getting
the
money
at
the
end
of
the
school
year
and
they
may
spend
it
for
a
vacation
or
for
a
down
payment
on
a
car
anyway
they
want
and
it's
just
like
another,
so
the
argument
goes
it's
just
like
any
other
general
purpose,
general
welfare
legislation.
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
directory,
before
i
do
i
want
to
address
my
self
to
it
factually
because
i
believe
it
is
factually
incorrect,
although
none
of
us,
myself
included
have
made
this
point
in
our
briefs.
this
is
not
a
true
tuition
reimbursement
law.
if
your
honors
will
look
the
appendix,
pages
60-61,
which
contains
the
act,
it
says
that
to
become
eligible,
to
receive
this
reimbursement,
$150
for
a
high
school
child,
$75
for
an
elementary
school
child,
the
parent
must
produce
and
show
to
the
authority
a
receipted
tuition
bill
or
a
copy
of
an
executed
contract,
under
which
the
student
attended
the
public
--
non-public
school
and
in
the
next
paragraph
when
it
talks
about
receiving
the
money,
the
amount
a
parent
receives,
apparently
receives
the
less
of
$150
or
“the
actual
amount
of
tuition
paid
or
contracted
to
be
paid
by
a
parent.”
so
let's
understand
the
legislative
scheme.
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
a
parent
to
have
paid
this
tuition
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
year
get
it
back
from
the
state.
the
parent
need
only
execute
a
contract
at
the
begging
of
the
school
year,
at
the
end
of
the
school
year,
he
must
only
show
the
contract
and
upon
showing
the
contract,
he
gets
his
$150
and
he
may
or
may
not,
pay
is
overdue
tuition
bill,
but
i
wouldn't
want
this
case
to
go
off
on
factual
difference.
but
i
wanted
to
make
the
point,
because
it
seem
clear
to
me
that
even
this
was
true
tuition
reimbursement
bill,
it
isn't
so
much
the
receipt
of
money
by
your
parent
or
last
year's
attendance,
which
encourages
that
parent
to
send
us
child
to
parochial
school
next
year.
indeed
in
the
case
of
a
high
school
senior
at
a
parochial
school
that's
not
so
at
all.
the
parent
gets
the
money
for
the
12th
grade
at
the
end
of
12th
grade
and
he
is
not
going
to
use
the
parochial
education
of
his
child.
it
seems
to
me
that,
that's
not
pertinent.
it
is
in
fact
a
promise
of
reimbursement
made
by
the
state
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
when
the
parent
is
deciding
whether
to
go
to
a
--
send
his
child
to
a
public
or
parochial
school,
it's
through
that
promise,
the
statutory
promise
by
which
pennsylvania
is
encouraging
parents
to
send
or
to
continue
to
send
their
children
to
non-public
schools
which
in
the
maine
and
pennsylvania
are
sectarians
schools.
this
is
nothing
like
general
welfare
legislation.
of
course,
of
the
recipient
of
a
social
security
to
check
and
decide
to
use
it
send
his
grandchild
to
parochial
school.
the
recipient
of
an
employment
compensation
check
can
turn
it
over
to
his
parish
priest.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes
sir,
by
all
means,
by
all
means.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
clearly
here
we
have
the
state
may
be
paying
the
entire
tuition
because
if
it's
less
than
a
150
–
the
entire
tuition
is
a
$150,
the
child
gets
a
$150.
i
understood
your
honor
to
be
asking
the
question
what
if
the
statute
said,
never
more
than
half
the
tuition
and
made
a
legislative
finding
that
at
least
half
of
the
budget
of
the
parochial
school
is
spent
for
secular
educational
parochial.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
my
argument
remain
the
same,
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes,
sir
it
makes
no
difference
at
all.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
am
not
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
am
so
much
in
trouble
[laughter]
as
you
know
any
attempt
sir,
it
will
take
all
of
the
court's
previous
decisions
and
apply
them
in
a
symmetrical
way
to
every
church
state
case
that
comes
before
the
court,
is
going
to
meet
with
some
trouble
and
i
will
grant
justice
white
that,
but
i
think
the
everson
case
gives
me
some
problems,
it
gave
the
court
problems
and
as
i
understand
it
some
of
those
who
voted
in
favor
of
it
that
now
sit
on
this
court
have
indicated
if
they
had
to
do
it
over
again,
they
wouldn't.
point
of
the
matter
of
course
is
that
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
the
lemon
dissent
so
case
said
that,
everson,
a
decision
which
was
thought
to
take
us
to
the
verge
of
constitutional
permissibility
really
began
us
what
might
be
a
downhill
thrust
and
as
i
understood
that
context
in
which
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
was
talking
in
that
case,
it
was
an
effort
to
say,
we
got
to
be
careful
in
each
decision
as
to
where
it's
going
to
lead
us.
in
everson,
i
think
led
the
court,
led
the
society
into
a
great
many
legislative
schemes
that
have
had
to
pass
constitutional
muster
or
fail
to
pass
constitutional
muster
before
this
court
before.
i
was
making
the
point
just
a
moment
ago
that
the
difference
between
the
fellow
who
gets
his
unemployment
compensation
check
and
turns
it
over
to
his
church
and
the
parent
who
gets
reimbursement
here
is
that
that
fellow
who
gets
his
unemployment
compensation
check
didn't
get
it
because
he
performed
some
religious
act
or
did
something
that
advanced
religion.
he
got
it
for
entirely
different
reasons
and
he
is
free
to
use
as
he
will,
but
judge
lord
in
the
lower
court
here
i
think
was
precisely
correct
when
he
defined
this
issue
by
saying,
“it
is
whether
individuals
may
receive
state
funds
solely
because
they
have
paid
tuition
at
a
church
related
school.”
if
i
may
paraphrase
what
the
court
said
in
lemon
dissent
sir.
“if
rhode
island
may
not
supplement
teachers'
salaries
without
being
certain
that
those
teachers
do
not
teach
religion
then
it
seems
to
me
a
fortiori
that
pennsylvania
may
not
reimburse
tuition
to
parochial
school
parents
when
they
are
absolutely
certain
that,
that
tuition
is
being
used
to
advance
or
teach
religion.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
what
i
reminded
of
sir
is
some
of
the
court's
opinions
or
concurring
opinions
or
dissenting
opinions,
i
do
not
remember
now
which,
years
ago
we
used
to
cite
bible
reading
in
the
public
schools
which
had
not
yet
been
declared
unconstitutional
as
saying
well
how
about
bible
reading
of
the
public
schools.
we
have
been
doing
back
for
a
years,
so
it
does
not
it
justify
the
next
process
and
of
course
when
bible
reading
in
the
public
schools
finally
came
before
the
court
it
was
unanimously
declared
unconstitutional.
i
only
make
that
point
to
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
gi
bill
of
rights,
has
ever
come
before
this
or
any
other
court
on
first
amendment
grounds.
i
am
not
suggesting
which
way
it
should
go
if
it
should
come
here
and
i
hope
it
does
not
come
here,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
and
by
the
way
that
is
saying
something
significant
too.
i
think
that
since
the
gi
bill
has
been
in
affect
for
so
many,
many,
many
years
and
nobody
has
ever
challenged
it,
indicates
that
it's
something
that
the
society
has
fully
accepted
and
will
not
and
would
never
caused
the
political
divisiveness
that
some
other
types
of
legislation
will,
such
as
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
take,
there
are
distinctions
of
course,
but
to
take
the
kind
of
statute
that
a
nation
passes
after
a
war
in
which
it
feels
it
owe
so
much
to
those
people
who
fought
the
war
for
them
and
say
we
are
going
to
repay
this
by
making
your
education
possible,
here
is
the
money,
spend
it
anyway
you
will,
but
for
education
per
se,
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
is
not
precedent
for
anything
that
we
have
before
for
anything
that
we
have
before
the
court
today.
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
well,
i
have
reach
the
point
in
my
argument
and
if
i
may,
it
is
the
last
point
in
my
argument,
it
is
political
entanglement
and
i
want
to
spend
a
few
moments
on
it
with
the
court's
permission
and
i
will
close.
if
this
legislation
were
validated,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
that
fears
expressed
by
the
founding
fathers
and
justices
of
this
court
justice
after
justice
of
divisiveness
along
religious
lines,
sect
again
sect,
each
sect
attempting
to
use
whatever
political
muscle
it
can
garner
to
get
its
fair
share
of
the
pie,
deal
making
between
sects
in
order
to
get
that
muscle,
all
of
those
spheres
it
seems
to
me
realistically
would
spring
back
to
life
again.
and
our
political
process
would
be
corrupted
and
i
submit
our
religions
would
be
demeaned.
mr.
ball
has
said
in
his
reply
brief
that
that
is
a
constitutionally
malevolent
argument
that
to
permit
blacks
and
other
groups
within
the
society
to
seek
financial
aid
of
various
sorts
for
various
reasons
but
not
permit
parochial
school
advocates
to
do
the
same
thing
is
constitutionally
malevolent.
and
i
suppose
that
it's
true
that
every
effort
by
any
group
in
the
society
to
attain
funding
is
opposed
in
a
society
as
large
as
ours
by
some
other
group
and
to
that
degree
it's
of
course
divisive,
but
mr.
chief
justice
berger
made
it
abundantly
clear
in
lemon
dissent
so
that
the
attempt
to
obtain
funding
for
religious
purposes
has
always
been
meaner,
has
always
been
divisive
and
is
likely
to
strain
a
society
like
ours
to
the
breaking
point
and
that
is
why
in
schempp
this
court
said
the
very
purpose
of
a
bill
of
rights
was
to
withdraw
certain
subjects
from
the
divestitutes
of
political
controversy,
religion
being
one
of
them,0
they
depend
on
the
outcome
of
no
elections
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
religious
freedom
was
first
in
the
bill
of
rights
because
it
was
first
in
the
forefathers'
mind
and
it
was
set
forth
in
absolute
terms
and
it
is
strength
is
its
rigidity.
so
when
the
appellants
are
offended
by
political
divisiveness
argument
their
quarrel
is
not
with
me
and
is
not
with
the
court,
it
is
with
the
very
underpinnings
of
the
first
amendment
and
i
take
it
we
do
not
have
before
us
today
the
question
of
whether
we
don't
deal
or
we
deal.
the
point
is
if
i
may
for
just
a
moment,
it
is
difficult
to
talk
about
a
little
–
even
a
little
history
before
this
court
which
has
expressed
so
much
honor,
the
point
is
that,
that
we
were
an
enormously
diverse
people
in
the
first
place
and
that
is
why
we
made
the
separation
experiment
and
europe
did
not
it,
it
was
an
american
experiment
because
you
know
it
strikes
me
of
the
thomas
jefferson,
james
madison,
they
weren't
the
only
two
gentleman
who
understood
in
their
bones
that
when
the
power
of
religion,
when
religion
is
backed
by
the
power
of
government,
that
it
corrodes
both
processes,
government
and
religion.
the
european
contemporaries
must
have
known
it
better
than
they,
but
they
did
not
experiment
with
separation.
we
did
and
why
did
we
because
we
were
nation
building
and
we
were
building
a
nation
of
diverse
religions
and
ethnic
groups
and
it
is
not
a
question
of
ancient
history
as
mr.
ball
implied
in
his
brief.
mr.
brennan,
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
his
separate
schempp
opinion
that
our
religious
composition
in
this
country
today
is
far
more
the
diverse
than
it
was
several
hundred
years
ago
and
i
think
that
the
point
must
be
made
that
there
is
an
enormous
unity
that
--
and
here
as
in
european
society
which
for
1000
or
2000
years
has
shared
a
common
soil,
developed
a
common
language
undergoing
common
terrible
trauma,
a
unity
that
we
did
not
have
two
hundred
years
ago
which
i
suggest
contemporary
events
can
lead
us
all
to
believe
we
still
do
not
have.
so
perhaps
europe
would
survive
the
strains
of
establishment,
but
we
could
not.
the
judgment
was
made
by
the
forefathers
that
we
could
not
and
that
is
why
--
that
is
what
i
think
justice
frankfurter
was
saying
in
mcgowan
when
he
said
the
great
american
principle
of
eternal
separation
is
one
of
the
vital
reliances
of
our
system
for
assuring
unities
then
our
diversities.
given
and
already
at
--
well,
let
me
conclude.
this
legislation,
act
92,
i
do
not
understand
distinction
between
this
situation
in
wolman
versus
essex.
i
do
not
understand
this
argument
about
annual
appropriations
because
there
really
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
this
law
that
identical
it
validated
would
come
up
year
after
year,
not
in
some
administrative
body
where
after
all
there
isn't
much
entanglement,
but
in
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
where
there
is
a
great
deal,
there
is
no
reasoning
in
the
world
to
believe
that
a
$150
for
a
high
school
child
and
75
is
the
end
of
road.
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
berger
noted
in
lemon
v.
dicenso
about
that
pennsylvania
law,
lemon
versus
kurtzman
about
that
pennsylvania
law
passed
in
1968
that
under
it
$5
million
a
year
went
to
parochial
--
to
non-public
schools,
most
of
which
were
parochial.
i
call
to
your
honor's
attention
that
that
law
was
invalidated
in
june
of
1971.
that
this
law
was
passed
less
than
two
months
later
that
attorney
general
packel
has
nodded
in
his
brief
that
under
this
law
up
to
$75
million
will
be
paid
to
parents
of
non-public
school
children.
a
15-fold
increase
in
several
years
reminds
me
of
mr.
chief
justice
berger's
comments
in
waltz
that
if
tax
exemption
can
be
seen
as
the
first
step
in
the
establishment
of
religion
then
the
second
step
has
been
long
in
coming,
that
may
very
well
be
in
respect
of
tax
exemption,
it
most
certainly
is
not
in
respective
aid
to
sectarian
education.
the
second
step
came
within
two
months
and
it
was
a
15-fold
increase.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
am
not
sure
sir,
the
attorney
general
does
know?[laughter]
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
77%
balance,
i
do
not
go
where
it
goes
for
other
purposes
and
i
do
not
know
what
they
are.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
believe
--
i
cannot
answer
that
because
i
believe,
but
i
am
not
certain
that
the
1968
law
that
was
invalidated
by
this
court
was
initially
funded
through
the
harness
raising
receipts
and
then
was
funded
by
the
cigarette
tax
which
i
think
was
increased
for
that
purpose,
but
i
am
really
not
certain
and
i
am
not
helping
the
court
by
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
think
there
was
but
i
am
not
sure
i
am
sorry.
i
want
to
simply
say
this
on
political
entanglement
and
then
i
will
sit
down.
in
the
lower
court
i
was
joined
by
amici
who
joined
in
my
brief,
many,
one
of
them
was
the
state
counsel
of
churches
which
is
organized,
mostly
organized
protestants
in
pennsylvania,
and
another
was
pennsylvania
jewish
community
relations
conference
which
is
the
most
of
the
organized
jury
in
pennsylvania
and
i
asked,
to
ask
myself,
take
product
--
the
bitter,
angry,
and
frustrated
when
legislation
like
this
comes
up
for
consideration
and
is
indeed
passed.
this
legislation
represents
an
enormous
change
if
i
may
say
at
this
way
in
the
rules
of
the
game
after
one
side
has
committed
itself
to
the
old
rules
and
has
changed
its
position
irretrievably,
by
that
i
mean
that
it
is
a
130
years
ago,
when
every
state
in
the
union
already
had
as
part
of
its
fundamental
law
that
the
state
could
not
support
sectarian
education.
all
those
cards
were
on
the
table,
everybody
knew
that
and
at
that
point
in
time
protestant
america
decided
to
let
its
religious
schools
become
public
schools.
catholic
america
decided
to
start
on
the
process
of
building
the
great
and
complex
parochial
school
system
that
it
has
today.
for
the
government
to
come
along
a
130
years
later
and
say
now
we
are
going
to
begin
funding
sectarian
education
is
it
seems
to
me
the
grossest
kind
of
interference
of
government
in
the
competition
between
queens
which
justice
douglas
and
zorach
said
that
in
that
competition
between
these,
the
government
must
be
absolutely
neutral.
this
is
isn’t
some
peripheral
thing
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
parochial
education
which
this
court
has
set
and
which
many
educators
has
set,
is
singularly
the
most
effective
way
of
passing
on
a
religious
heritage
from
one
generation
to
another,
where
the
states
have
come
along
and
begin
to
support
only
those
religions
and
there
are
a
number
of
them
which
have
parochial
schools,
but
none
of
the
religions
and
this
is
most
of
them
which
do
not
have
parochial
school
is
laying
the
heavy
hand
of
government
on
that
competition
and
for
that
reason
will
cause
enormous
and
has
caused
enormous
divisiveness.
for
all
of
these
reasons
i
respectfully
request
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
