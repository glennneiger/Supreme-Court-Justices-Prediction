mr.
henry
t.
reath
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
today
on
behalf
of
one
parent
with
children
in
nonpublic
schools,
private
independent
schools.
i
am
also
counsel
for
the
pennsylvania
association
of
independent
schools
and
in
essence
i
speak
really
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
parents
of
the
children
attending
nonpublic
schools
within
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
i
think
that
at
the
outset
it
is
important
to
notice
the
tremendous
diversity
of
interests
that
had
shown
their
unqualified
support
for
this
pennsylvania
act.
for
example,
we
have
filed
in
this
case
or
in
the
court
below,
amicus
briefs
filed
by
solicitor
general
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government,
a
very
strong
brief
filed
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
pennsylvania.
there
is
an
exceptionally
strong
brief
filed
by
the
city
solicitor
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
it's
financially
beleaguered
school
district.
there
is
a
brief
that
has
been
filed
by
the
national
association
of
independent
schools
supporting
100%
this
act.
there
is
also
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
court
below
by
the
pennsylvania
association
of
independent
schools
and
finally
and
i
think
most
significantly,
your
honors,
will
see
attached
to
our
brief,
a
copy
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
court
below
by
the
benjamin
banneker
preschool,
which
is
a
school
in
a
prominently
urban
ghetto
district
of
philadelphia
and
it
is
a
school
which
depends
almost
entirely
upon
individual
tuitions
and
because
all
of
the
students
attending
that
school
are
eligible,
they
too
have
joined
in.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no
sir,
not
at
all,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
the
only
point
that
i
want
to
mention
is
that
this
--
that
the
effect
of
this
act
is
to
cover
every
segment
of
education
in
pennsylvania
and
in
no
way
could
it
be
said,
that
it
either
its
purpose
or
effect
was
designed
solely
for
religious
or
secular
schools.
now
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
respectfully
state
to
the
court
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
rationale,
if
this
court
affirms
of
the
rationale
of
the
lower
court
in
holding
pennsylvania
act
92
unconstitutional
then
you
have
to
invalidate
every
major
piece
of
federal
and
most
state
legislations,
including
the
gi
bill
and
it
successor
whereby
grants
or
low
interest
loans
with
liberal
forgiveness
provisions
are
given
to
college
and
post
graduate
students.
for
example,
under
the
1958
national
defense
student
loan
program
act
has
greatly
expanded
by
the
higher
education
act
of
1965.
there
is
presently
in
excess
of
one
billion
dollars
being
paid
out
to
several
million
students
of
college
age
attending
higher
education
and
postgraduate
work.
but
these
acts
if
your
honor's
please,
as
is
the
case
with
the
pennsylvania
act
which
was
stricken,
and
for
the
reason
that
the
pennsylvania
act
was
stricken,
do
not
place
any
restriction
whatsoever
to
ensure
that
the
funds
are
restricted
and
here
i
quote
the
language
of
the
lower
court,
“to
secular
education
or
general
welfare
services.”
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
even
invalidate
an
act
which
is
in
been
in
effect
for
the
last
25
years
whereby
the
congress
authorizes
pages
in
this
very
court
to
receive
a
private
education,
nonpublic
education
at
a
private
or
parochial
school
of
their
choice.
and
there
is
absolutely
of
course,
in
that
act
not
only
not
a
restriction,
but
a
recognition
that
as
long
as
the
money
goes
to
the
child
or
to
the
parent
and
the
parent
is
the
one
who
controls
the
choice
of
school
that
does
not
constitute
any
act
of
the
state
or
the
federal
government
involved
in
advancing
religion,
but
to
the
contrary
it
is
the
traditional
role
of
the
state
or
federal
government
being
absolutely
neutral.
now
in
this
case
your
honors,
there
were
three
points
that
the
lower
court
made
that
were
absolutely
wrong
and
show
how
totally
in
err
they
were
in
offsetting
this
act.
the
first
of
course,
is
the
failure
to
restrict
to
sectarian
education,
a
concept
that
this
court
has
never
accepted
and
i
would
hope
that
the
court
never
would
with
the
frightful
consequences
that
would
flow
as
a
result
of
such
a
narrow
interpretation.
the
second
had
to
do
with
the
so
called
conduit
theory.
what
the
court
said
was
well,
it
does
not
really
make
any
difference.
when
you
pay
the
money
to
the
parent
you
really
are
giving
it
to
the
school
and
why
try
to
say
that
there
is
any
essential
difference
or
distinction.
and
then
finally
as
mr.
ball
pointed
out,
what
the
court
tried
to
do
was
to
buoy
up
the
weakness
of
the
other
two
arguments
to
say
well,
anyhow
we
find
that
the
effect
of
this
act,
even
though,
the
purpose
is
secular
in
nature
to
advance
education,
that
the
effect
of
the
act
is
to
aid
and
advance
religion
because
we
find
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
that
90%
of
the
children
who
might
be
benefited
are
attending
parochial
schools.
now
as
far
as
the
--
i
think
and
here
is
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
as
emphatically
your
honors
as
i
possibly
can,
that
where
the
court
fail
into
the
error
of
its
ways
in
the
lower
court
was
it
totally
and
completely
misunderstood
the
problem
facing
this
court
in
lemon
and
tilton
and
di
sanzo
(ph),
where
the
court
was
trying
to
experiment
or
trying
to
find
the
outer
and
the
inner
limits
of
how
you
could
pay
money
directly
to
an
institution,
directly
to
an
institution.
that
was
the
problem
in
tilton
that
mr.
chief
justice
had
to
resolve.
that
was
the
problem
in
lemon
and
kurtzman.
the
funds
were
paid
to
the
institution.
it
was
the
institution
that
had
the
control
of
the
funds
and
not
the
parent.
now
in
order
to
cope
with
that
problem,
in
order
to
face
up
to
that
situation,
the
court
in
tilton
quite
properly
said,
if
you
are
going
to
pay
funds
to
an
institution
we
want
some
safeguards
and
those
safeguards
were
at
this
probation
against
religious
use.
now
as
far
as
the
conduit
theory.
the
conduit
what
they
say
is
that
it
makes
no
difference.
it
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
and
we
say
to
your
honors
it
is
a
distinction
which
makes
all
the
difference
because
when
you
pay
the
money
to
the
parent,
the
parent
becomes
the
wall
of
separation
between
church
and
state.
the
recipient
institution
who
may
ultimately
benefit,
of
course,
they
will
indirectly
benefit
from
this
tuition
program
in
a
sense,
but
they
have
no
call
on
the
funds.
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
ensure
year
after
year
they
are
going
to
get
the
funds.
that
isn't
true
where
you
have
payments
direct
made
directly
to
the
institution.
secondly
the
state
has
no
control
over
the
use
of
the
funds.
now,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
read
to
the
court
one
statement
that
was
made
by
kingman
brewster
in
a
report
of
the
president,
at
the
yale
university
in
1970
because
i
think
it
illustrates
the
very
basic
and
fundamental
difference
whether
you
are
dealing
in
secondary
education
or
in
higher
education,
between
payment
to
the
parent
and
payment
to
the
institution
and
here
is
what
mr.
brewster
said,
talking
about
the
plight
of
higher
education.
“the
only
other
prospect
for
a
new
trigatory
to
fee
yale’s
income
stream
would
be
the
introduction
of
some
massive
program
of
federal
assistance.
if
this
took
the
form
of
assisting
students,
either
with
grants
or
with
a
guarantee
of
their
postponed
tuition
payments,
it
would
be
quite
consistent
with
the
university’s
freedom
and
autonomy.
if
on
the
other
hand,
new
federal
subvention
were
to
take
the
form
of
direct
block
grants
to
the
institution,
there
would
be
serious
worries
about
the
dependents
upon
political
favor
which
this
would
entail.
if
federal
assistance
became
built
into
yale’s
budget,
we
might
find
ourselves
in
a
terrible
bind
if
they
shift
the
national
priorities
cut
off
the
pipeline.
more
serious
would
be
the
temptation
of
some
future
congress
to
attach
strings
and
conditions
to
such
grants.
future
legislators
might
seek
to
bend
or
work,
if
not
direct
our
educational
research
or
admissions
policy.”
and
to
the
same
effect
is
a
statement
made
by
william
bowen,
now
president
of
princeton
university
in
which
he
said
exactly
the
same
thing,
highlighting
the
essential
distinction
between
payment
to
the
parent
and
payment
to
an
institution.
indeed,
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
channeling
funds
for
higher
education
through
the
student
is
that
this
minimizes
the
danger
of
political
control
of
higher
education.
now
in
addition
to
the
practical
considerations,
your
honors,
there
are
two
very
significant
and
major
constitutional
differences
where
the
money
is
paid
to
the
parent,
rather
than
to
the
institution.
one
of
them
is
illustrated
by
the
judd
case
which
is
cited
by
mr.
mann
in
his
brief
because
he
says
there
that
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference,
whether
it’s
a
direct
or
an
indirect
payment.
well,
it
makes
a
tremendous
difference
because
in
the
judd
case,
which
interestingly
enough
was
decided
8
years
before
everson
and
it
had
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
state
of
new
york
will
provide
a
bussing
for
parents.
there
the
court
held
that
there
was
an
indirect
benefit
and
if
you
were
dealing
with
an
indirect
benefit
and
that,
that
was
a
specific
violation
of
a
very
specific
provision
in
the
new
york
state
constitution
which
under
section
4,
article
9
of
the
constitution
says,
that
you
may
not
use
public
funds
to
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
in
aid
or
maintenance,
other
than
for
etcetera
--
for
an
educational
institution
that
teaches
a
specific
religious
doctrine.
then
and
i
don’t
have
time
to
read
it
to
you,
your
honors,
now
but
i
would
ask
you
to
make
note
of
a
the
court's,
at
page
212
of
the
court's
decision
in
this
regard
where
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
reason
that
the
reason
that
there
was
such
a
difference
--
that
there
was
no
difference
between
a
direct
and
indirect
was
because
the
statue
specifically
said,
direct
or
indirect.
that
clearly
as
your
honors
know
is
not
the
test
that
this
court
has
decided
in
the
everson,
in
allen
and
in
tilton.
the
mere
fact
that
the
religious
institution
may
benefit
indirectly
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
now
the
other
constitutional
difference
and
this
is
referred
to
in
my
brief
and
i
won’t
have
time
to
develop
it
extensively
before
the
court,
but
it’s
in
our
brief
at
page
32,
the
other
significant
constitutional
difference,
when
you
pay
money
to
the
parent,
is
that
when
the
parent
gets
this
money,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
at
that
point
he
is
free
from
any
further
inquiry
by
the
state,
by
the
court
or
any
other
body
as
to
what
he
does
with
it
and
what
are
or
are
not
the
religious
practices
of
the
school
to
which
he
elects
to
send
his
children.
this
is
under
the
very
same
first
amendment
rights
and
the
other
rights
that
this
court
has
found
such
as
the
right
of
privacy,
which
was
discussed
in
a
roe
v.
wade
and
other
cases,
where
the
court
has
said
that
you
are
free
from
inquiry
and
if
you
are
free
from
inquiry,
you
cannot
trace
and
attempt
to
trace
the
funds
from
the
parent
into
any
religious
institution.
and
therein
you
see
lies
the
error
of
the
ways
of
the
lower
court
because
what
the
lower
court
did,
they
were
faced
with
this
problem
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
early
in
the
pleadings,
but
they
ultimately
swept
the
problem
under
the
rug
and
in
the
final
decision
of
the
court
they
said,
well,
we
find
as
a
practical
matter
that
90%
of
the
parents
who
are
benefiter
children
who
are
going
to
religious
schools,
but
you
cannot,
where
the
money
is
paid
to
the
parent
i
suggest,
you
cannot
make
any
determination
of
what
happens
thereafter.
you
cannot
make
any
determination
to
trying
to
trace
the
religious
or
non-religious
use
and
if
you
can’t
do
that
and
that
then
brings
me,
if
your
honors
please,
to
the
last
point
that
i
want
to
make.
it
has
to
do
with
the
whole
question
of
burden
of
proof.
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
a
party
coming
in
to
this
court
or
the
federal
court,
to
ask
this
court
the
extraordinary
--
to
use
the
extraordinary
powers
it
has
of
declaring
state
action
unconstitutional
must
carry
the
burden
and
he
must
establish
those
facts
on
the
record
to
show
that
there
is
a
religious
effect,
for
example,
in
this
case.
secondly,
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
there
is
a
very
heavy
presumption
of
constitutionality
to
state
action
and
the
court
will
only
overrule
state
action,
will
reverse
state
action
in
the
very
clearest
of
cases.
and
finally,
this
court,
mr.
justice
powell
will
know
very
well
of
what
i
speak,
in
the
court's
opinion
in
the
rodriguez
case
and
as
reaffirmed
as
lately
as
a
in
lemon
and
sloane
ii
where
the
court
again
pointed
out
that
the
reluctance
of
this
court
in
a
federal
system
to
substitute
it’s
judgment
or
to
interfere
with,
the
delicate
and
complex
problems
of
social
and
educational
policy
that
are
involved
in
this
whole
question
of
whether
you
are
going
to
support
pluralism
in
education
or
whether
you
are
going
to
have
a
single
own
bracing
monolithic
public
system.
now
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
there
are
good,
sound
arguments
to
be
made
for
both.
it
happens,
however,
that
pennsylvania
has
made
a
commitment
to
pluralism,
and
one
which
i
happily
endorse
and
applaud,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
i
think
that
that
is
a
matter
for
the
individual
sovereign
states
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
the
will
and
desire
of
the
sovereign
states,
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
take
a
look,
when
you
review
this
case
further,
it
–
exhibit
c
of
our
brief,
where
we
have
attached
a
list
of
the
different
ways
in
which
the
several
states
have
attempted
to
make
their
major
commitment
to
pluralism
in
education.
i
would
like
to
close
my
remarks,
if
i
may,
by
reading
several
lines
from
the
brief
of
the
national
association
of
independent
schools
which
i
think
speaks
as
eloquently
to
this
whole
problem
as
any
language
that
has
been
set
down
on
paper
to
date
and
it
as
follow.
“to
say
as
some
critics
do
and
without
a
shred
of
evidence
to
support
it,
that
the
parent
acts
as
a
mere
conduit
to
the
school
is
to
denegrade
the
very
stuff
of
which
this
country’s
greatness
was
made
and
to
undermine
the
rock
upon
which
our
constitution
and
bill
of
rights
is
grounded;
personal
freedom
and
the
right
of
each
individual
to
make
his
own
free
choice.
where
the
parent
is
a
recipient
of
state
a,
he
alone
decides
how
and
where
the
funds
are
applied
and
thus,
effectively
cuts
off
state
control
or
participation
thereby,
enabling
the
state
to
aid
it’s
legitimate
interests
in
secular
education
and
at
the
same
time
to
preserve
in
the
words
of
the
chief
justice’s
disparate
of
the
naval
neutrality
which
will
neither
advance
nor
inhibit
religion.
this
is
in
the
best
tradition
of
a
country
that
treasures
it’s
private
institutions
and
the
freedom
and
rights
of
individuals
far
from
offending
the
constitution
to
wish
an
aid
to
parent
supports
and
reinforces
the
very
principles
the
constitution
was
designed
to
protect.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
lower
court
and
to
find
that
this
is
a
lawful
exercise
of
the
state's
concern
with
preserving
pluralism
in
education
and
define
that
the
pennsylvania
act
1992
apparent
reimbursement
is
in
every
sense
constitutional.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
there
are
several
very
fundamental
differences.
i
think
the
most
important,
your
honor
is
that
this
bill
as
has
been
pointed
out
previously
is
self-executing.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
there
are
other
differences
in
the
structure
of
the
act.
in
wolman
it
was
part
of
a
total
educational
appropriation
which
i
guess
comes
back
to
the
same
point
of
one
year
and
i
confess
that
i
am
not
familiar,
your
honor,
with
the
intimate
workings
of
the
ohio
case,
but
i
think
that
essentially
that
is
the
basis
that
ohio
was
turned
down
the
lower
court
was
on
the
concept
of
entanglement.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
devise
and
here
that
has
been
completely
eliminated.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
my
closing
statement?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no
sir,
it
is
not.
it
was
in
the
record
below
and
i
read
it
at
the
time
of
oral
argument.
i
have
the
copy
and
i
would
be
happy
to
furnish
the
full
statement
to
the
court
if
that
was
desired.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
but
it
was
read.
i
mean,
the
document
itself
wasn't
offered,
but
it
was
read
and
used
in
the
oral
argument
below.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
it
was
in
the
--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes
sir,
it
was
in
the
president's
annual
report
for
the
--
the
report
of
the
president
of
yale
university
for
1970-71.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
your
honors
please,
just
a
simple
matter
with
what
mr.
ball
said
in
response
to
mr.
mann's
statement
about
the
character,
the
aided
activity.
he
said
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
was
parochial
education.
i
submit
there
was
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
it
to
the
contrary.
the
parent
gets
the
money
not
because
he
sends
his
child
to
a
parochial
school,
but
because
he
has
assisted
the
state
in
meeting
the
state's
requirement
for
compulsory
education.
secondly
with
respect
to
political
divisiveness,
i
agree
again
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
further
more
i
would
point
out
that
mr
chief
justice
in
the
lemon
and
tilton
cases
when
he
spoke
of
political
divisiveness
there,
we
are
dealing
again
with
the
problem
of
aid
to
an
institution
where
the
institution
had
an
on
going
call
for
the
funds.
here
you
have
payment
to
a
parent.
a
parent
is
an
individual
person.
he
has
individual
constitutional
rights
and
one
of
those
rights,
is
the
right
of
free
speech,
the
right
of
freedom
of
petition,
the
right
to
go
to
his
legislative
assembly
and
say,
i
want
this
because
i
am
entitled
to
it.
i
think
the
difference
again
highlights
the
essential
distinction
between
payment
to
a
parent
which
we
have
here,
payment
to
institution
which
we
have
in
lemon
and
kurtzman.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
today
on
behalf
of
one
parent
with
children
in
nonpublic
schools,
private
independent
schools.
i
am
also
counsel
for
the
pennsylvania
association
of
independent
schools
and
in
essence
i
speak
really
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
parents
of
the
children
attending
nonpublic
schools
within
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
i
think
that
at
the
outset
it
is
important
to
notice
the
tremendous
diversity
of
interests
that
had
shown
their
unqualified
support
for
this
pennsylvania
act.
for
example,
we
have
filed
in
this
case
or
in
the
court
below,
amicus
briefs
filed
by
solicitor
general
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government,
a
very
strong
brief
filed
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
pennsylvania.
there
is
an
exceptionally
strong
brief
filed
by
the
city
solicitor
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
it's
financially
beleaguered
school
district.
there
is
a
brief
that
has
been
filed
by
the
national
association
of
independent
schools
supporting
100%
this
act.
there
is
also
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
court
below
by
the
pennsylvania
association
of
independent
schools
and
finally
and
i
think
most
significantly,
your
honors,
will
see
attached
to
our
brief,
a
copy
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
court
below
by
the
benjamin
banneker
preschool,
which
is
a
school
in
a
prominently
urban
ghetto
district
of
philadelphia
and
it
is
a
school
which
depends
almost
entirely
upon
individual
tuitions
and
because
all
of
the
students
attending
that
school
are
eligible,
they
too
have
joined
in.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no
sir,
not
at
all,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
the
only
point
that
i
want
to
mention
is
that
this
--
that
the
effect
of
this
act
is
to
cover
every
segment
of
education
in
pennsylvania
and
in
no
way
could
it
be
said,
that
it
either
its
purpose
or
effect
was
designed
solely
for
religious
or
secular
schools.
now
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
respectfully
state
to
the
court
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
rationale,
if
this
court
affirms
of
the
rationale
of
the
lower
court
in
holding
pennsylvania
act
92
unconstitutional
then
you
have
to
invalidate
every
major
piece
of
federal
and
most
state
legislations,
including
the
gi
bill
and
it
successor
whereby
grants
or
low
interest
loans
with
liberal
forgiveness
provisions
are
given
to
college
and
post
graduate
students.
for
example,
under
the
1958
national
defense
student
loan
program
act
has
greatly
expanded
by
the
higher
education
act
of
1965.
there
is
presently
in
excess
of
one
billion
dollars
being
paid
out
to
several
million
students
of
college
age
attending
higher
education
and
postgraduate
work.
but
these
acts
if
your
honor's
please,
as
is
the
case
with
the
pennsylvania
act
which
was
stricken,
and
for
the
reason
that
the
pennsylvania
act
was
stricken,
do
not
place
any
restriction
whatsoever
to
ensure
that
the
funds
are
restricted
and
here
i
quote
the
language
of
the
lower
court,
“to
secular
education
or
general
welfare
services.”
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
even
invalidate
an
act
which
is
in
been
in
effect
for
the
last
25
years
whereby
the
congress
authorizes
pages
in
this
very
court
to
receive
a
private
education,
nonpublic
education
at
a
private
or
parochial
school
of
their
choice.
and
there
is
absolutely
of
course,
in
that
act
not
only
not
a
restriction,
but
a
recognition
that
as
long
as
the
money
goes
to
the
child
or
to
the
parent
and
the
parent
is
the
one
who
controls
the
choice
of
school
that
does
not
constitute
any
act
of
the
state
or
the
federal
government
involved
in
advancing
religion,
but
to
the
contrary
it
is
the
traditional
role
of
the
state
or
federal
government
being
absolutely
neutral.
now
in
this
case
your
honors,
there
were
three
points
that
the
lower
court
made
that
were
absolutely
wrong
and
show
how
totally
in
err
they
were
in
offsetting
this
act.
the
first
of
course,
is
the
failure
to
restrict
to
sectarian
education,
a
concept
that
this
court
has
never
accepted
and
i
would
hope
that
the
court
never
would
with
the
frightful
consequences
that
would
flow
as
a
result
of
such
a
narrow
interpretation.
the
second
had
to
do
with
the
so
called
conduit
theory.
what
the
court
said
was
well,
it
does
not
really
make
any
difference.
when
you
pay
the
money
to
the
parent
you
really
are
giving
it
to
the
school
and
why
try
to
say
that
there
is
any
essential
difference
or
distinction.
and
then
finally
as
mr.
ball
pointed
out,
what
the
court
tried
to
do
was
to
buoy
up
the
weakness
of
the
other
two
arguments
to
say
well,
anyhow
we
find
that
the
effect
of
this
act,
even
though,
the
purpose
is
secular
in
nature
to
advance
education,
that
the
effect
of
the
act
is
to
aid
and
advance
religion
because
we
find
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
that
90%
of
the
children
who
might
be
benefited
are
attending
parochial
schools.
now
as
far
as
the
--
i
think
and
here
is
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
as
emphatically
your
honors
as
i
possibly
can,
that
where
the
court
fail
into
the
error
of
its
ways
in
the
lower
court
was
it
totally
and
completely
misunderstood
the
problem
facing
this
court
in
lemon
and
tilton
and
di
sanzo
(ph),
where
the
court
was
trying
to
experiment
or
trying
to
find
the
outer
and
the
inner
limits
of
how
you
could
pay
money
directly
to
an
institution,
directly
to
an
institution.
that
was
the
problem
in
tilton
that
mr.
chief
justice
had
to
resolve.
that
was
the
problem
in
lemon
and
kurtzman.
the
funds
were
paid
to
the
institution.
it
was
the
institution
that
had
the
control
of
the
funds
and
not
the
parent.
now
in
order
to
cope
with
that
problem,
in
order
to
face
up
to
that
situation,
the
court
in
tilton
quite
properly
said,
if
you
are
going
to
pay
funds
to
an
institution
we
want
some
safeguards
and
those
safeguards
were
at
this
probation
against
religious
use.
now
as
far
as
the
conduit
theory.
the
conduit
what
they
say
is
that
it
makes
no
difference.
it
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
and
we
say
to
your
honors
it
is
a
distinction
which
makes
all
the
difference
because
when
you
pay
the
money
to
the
parent,
the
parent
becomes
the
wall
of
separation
between
church
and
state.
the
recipient
institution
who
may
ultimately
benefit,
of
course,
they
will
indirectly
benefit
from
this
tuition
program
in
a
sense,
but
they
have
no
call
on
the
funds.
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
ensure
year
after
year
they
are
going
to
get
the
funds.
that
isn't
true
where
you
have
payments
direct
made
directly
to
the
institution.
secondly
the
state
has
no
control
over
the
use
of
the
funds.
now,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
read
to
the
court
one
statement
that
was
made
by
kingman
brewster
in
a
report
of
the
president,
at
the
yale
university
in
1970
because
i
think
it
illustrates
the
very
basic
and
fundamental
difference
whether
you
are
dealing
in
secondary
education
or
in
higher
education,
between
payment
to
the
parent
and
payment
to
the
institution
and
here
is
what
mr.
brewster
said,
talking
about
the
plight
of
higher
education.
“the
only
other
prospect
for
a
new
trigatory
to
fee
yale’s
income
stream
would
be
the
introduction
of
some
massive
program
of
federal
assistance.
if
this
took
the
form
of
assisting
students,
either
with
grants
or
with
a
guarantee
of
their
postponed
tuition
payments,
it
would
be
quite
consistent
with
the
university’s
freedom
and
autonomy.
if
on
the
other
hand,
new
federal
subvention
were
to
take
the
form
of
direct
block
grants
to
the
institution,
there
would
be
serious
worries
about
the
dependents
upon
political
favor
which
this
would
entail.
if
federal
assistance
became
built
into
yale’s
budget,
we
might
find
ourselves
in
a
terrible
bind
if
they
shift
the
national
priorities
cut
off
the
pipeline.
more
serious
would
be
the
temptation
of
some
future
congress
to
attach
strings
and
conditions
to
such
grants.
future
legislators
might
seek
to
bend
or
work,
if
not
direct
our
educational
research
or
admissions
policy.”
and
to
the
same
effect
is
a
statement
made
by
william
bowen,
now
president
of
princeton
university
in
which
he
said
exactly
the
same
thing,
highlighting
the
essential
distinction
between
payment
to
the
parent
and
payment
to
an
institution.
indeed,
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
channeling
funds
for
higher
education
through
the
student
is
that
this
minimizes
the
danger
of
political
control
of
higher
education.
now
in
addition
to
the
practical
considerations,
your
honors,
there
are
two
very
significant
and
major
constitutional
differences
where
the
money
is
paid
to
the
parent,
rather
than
to
the
institution.
one
of
them
is
illustrated
by
the
judd
case
which
is
cited
by
mr.
mann
in
his
brief
because
he
says
there
that
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference,
whether
it’s
a
direct
or
an
indirect
payment.
well,
it
makes
a
tremendous
difference
because
in
the
judd
case,
which
interestingly
enough
was
decided
8
years
before
everson
and
it
had
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
state
of
new
york
will
provide
a
bussing
for
parents.
there
the
court
held
that
there
was
an
indirect
benefit
and
if
you
were
dealing
with
an
indirect
benefit
and
that,
that
was
a
specific
violation
of
a
very
specific
provision
in
the
new
york
state
constitution
which
under
section
4,
article
9
of
the
constitution
says,
that
you
may
not
use
public
funds
to
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
in
aid
or
maintenance,
other
than
for
etcetera
--
for
an
educational
institution
that
teaches
a
specific
religious
doctrine.
then
and
i
don’t
have
time
to
read
it
to
you,
your
honors,
now
but
i
would
ask
you
to
make
note
of
a
the
court's,
at
page
212
of
the
court's
decision
in
this
regard
where
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
reason
that
the
reason
that
there
was
such
a
difference
--
that
there
was
no
difference
between
a
direct
and
indirect
was
because
the
statue
specifically
said,
direct
or
indirect.
that
clearly
as
your
honors
know
is
not
the
test
that
this
court
has
decided
in
the
everson,
in
allen
and
in
tilton.
the
mere
fact
that
the
religious
institution
may
benefit
indirectly
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
now
the
other
constitutional
difference
and
this
is
referred
to
in
my
brief
and
i
won’t
have
time
to
develop
it
extensively
before
the
court,
but
it’s
in
our
brief
at
page
32,
the
other
significant
constitutional
difference,
when
you
pay
money
to
the
parent,
is
that
when
the
parent
gets
this
money,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
at
that
point
he
is
free
from
any
further
inquiry
by
the
state,
by
the
court
or
any
other
body
as
to
what
he
does
with
it
and
what
are
or
are
not
the
religious
practices
of
the
school
to
which
he
elects
to
send
his
children.
this
is
under
the
very
same
first
amendment
rights
and
the
other
rights
that
this
court
has
found
such
as
the
right
of
privacy,
which
was
discussed
in
a
roe
v.
wade
and
other
cases,
where
the
court
has
said
that
you
are
free
from
inquiry
and
if
you
are
free
from
inquiry,
you
cannot
trace
and
attempt
to
trace
the
funds
from
the
parent
into
any
religious
institution.
and
therein
you
see
lies
the
error
of
the
ways
of
the
lower
court
because
what
the
lower
court
did,
they
were
faced
with
this
problem
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
early
in
the
pleadings,
but
they
ultimately
swept
the
problem
under
the
rug
and
in
the
final
decision
of
the
court
they
said,
well,
we
find
as
a
practical
matter
that
90%
of
the
parents
who
are
benefiter
children
who
are
going
to
religious
schools,
but
you
cannot,
where
the
money
is
paid
to
the
parent
i
suggest,
you
cannot
make
any
determination
of
what
happens
thereafter.
you
cannot
make
any
determination
to
trying
to
trace
the
religious
or
non-religious
use
and
if
you
can’t
do
that
and
that
then
brings
me,
if
your
honors
please,
to
the
last
point
that
i
want
to
make.
it
has
to
do
with
the
whole
question
of
burden
of
proof.
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
a
party
coming
in
to
this
court
or
the
federal
court,
to
ask
this
court
the
extraordinary
--
to
use
the
extraordinary
powers
it
has
of
declaring
state
action
unconstitutional
must
carry
the
burden
and
he
must
establish
those
facts
on
the
record
to
show
that
there
is
a
religious
effect,
for
example,
in
this
case.
secondly,
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
there
is
a
very
heavy
presumption
of
constitutionality
to
state
action
and
the
court
will
only
overrule
state
action,
will
reverse
state
action
in
the
very
clearest
of
cases.
and
finally,
this
court,
mr.
justice
powell
will
know
very
well
of
what
i
speak,
in
the
court's
opinion
in
the
rodriguez
case
and
as
reaffirmed
as
lately
as
a
in
lemon
and
sloane
ii
where
the
court
again
pointed
out
that
the
reluctance
of
this
court
in
a
federal
system
to
substitute
it’s
judgment
or
to
interfere
with,
the
delicate
and
complex
problems
of
social
and
educational
policy
that
are
involved
in
this
whole
question
of
whether
you
are
going
to
support
pluralism
in
education
or
whether
you
are
going
to
have
a
single
own
bracing
monolithic
public
system.
now
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
there
are
good,
sound
arguments
to
be
made
for
both.
it
happens,
however,
that
pennsylvania
has
made
a
commitment
to
pluralism,
and
one
which
i
happily
endorse
and
applaud,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
i
think
that
that
is
a
matter
for
the
individual
sovereign
states
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
the
will
and
desire
of
the
sovereign
states,
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
take
a
look,
when
you
review
this
case
further,
it
–
exhibit
c
of
our
brief,
where
we
have
attached
a
list
of
the
different
ways
in
which
the
several
states
have
attempted
to
make
their
major
commitment
to
pluralism
in
education.
i
would
like
to
close
my
remarks,
if
i
may,
by
reading
several
lines
from
the
brief
of
the
national
association
of
independent
schools
which
i
think
speaks
as
eloquently
to
this
whole
problem
as
any
language
that
has
been
set
down
on
paper
to
date
and
it
as
follow.
“to
say
as
some
critics
do
and
without
a
shred
of
evidence
to
support
it,
that
the
parent
acts
as
a
mere
conduit
to
the
school
is
to
denegrade
the
very
stuff
of
which
this
country’s
greatness
was
made
and
to
undermine
the
rock
upon
which
our
constitution
and
bill
of
rights
is
grounded;
personal
freedom
and
the
right
of
each
individual
to
make
his
own
free
choice.
where
the
parent
is
a
recipient
of
state
a,
he
alone
decides
how
and
where
the
funds
are
applied
and
thus,
effectively
cuts
off
state
control
or
participation
thereby,
enabling
the
state
to
aid
it’s
legitimate
interests
in
secular
education
and
at
the
same
time
to
preserve
in
the
words
of
the
chief
justice’s
disparate
of
the
naval
neutrality
which
will
neither
advance
nor
inhibit
religion.
this
is
in
the
best
tradition
of
a
country
that
treasures
it’s
private
institutions
and
the
freedom
and
rights
of
individuals
far
from
offending
the
constitution
to
wish
an
aid
to
parent
supports
and
reinforces
the
very
principles
the
constitution
was
designed
to
protect.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
lower
court
and
to
find
that
this
is
a
lawful
exercise
of
the
state's
concern
with
preserving
pluralism
in
education
and
define
that
the
pennsylvania
act
1992
apparent
reimbursement
is
in
every
sense
constitutional.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
there
are
several
very
fundamental
differences.
i
think
the
most
important,
your
honor
is
that
this
bill
as
has
been
pointed
out
previously
is
self-executing.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
well,
there
are
other
differences
in
the
structure
of
the
act.
in
wolman
it
was
part
of
a
total
educational
appropriation
which
i
guess
comes
back
to
the
same
point
of
one
year
and
i
confess
that
i
am
not
familiar,
your
honor,
with
the
intimate
workings
of
the
ohio
case,
but
i
think
that
essentially
that
is
the
basis
that
ohio
was
turned
down
the
lower
court
was
on
the
concept
of
entanglement.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
devise
and
here
that
has
been
completely
eliminated.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
my
closing
statement?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no
sir,
it
is
not.
it
was
in
the
record
below
and
i
read
it
at
the
time
of
oral
argument.
i
have
the
copy
and
i
would
be
happy
to
furnish
the
full
statement
to
the
court
if
that
was
desired.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
but
it
was
read.
i
mean,
the
document
itself
wasn't
offered,
but
it
was
read
and
used
in
the
oral
argument
below.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
it
was
in
the
--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes
sir,
it
was
in
the
president's
annual
report
for
the
--
the
report
of
the
president
of
yale
university
for
1970-71.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
your
honors
please,
just
a
simple
matter
with
what
mr.
ball
said
in
response
to
mr.
mann's
statement
about
the
character,
the
aided
activity.
he
said
the
character
of
the
aided
activity
was
parochial
education.
i
submit
there
was
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
it
to
the
contrary.
the
parent
gets
the
money
not
because
he
sends
his
child
to
a
parochial
school,
but
because
he
has
assisted
the
state
in
meeting
the
state's
requirement
for
compulsory
education.
secondly
with
respect
to
political
divisiveness,
i
agree
again
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
further
more
i
would
point
out
that
mr
chief
justice
in
the
lemon
and
tilton
cases
when
he
spoke
of
political
divisiveness
there,
we
are
dealing
again
with
the
problem
of
aid
to
an
institution
where
the
institution
had
an
on
going
call
for
the
funds.
here
you
have
payment
to
a
parent.
a
parent
is
an
individual
person.
he
has
individual
constitutional
rights
and
one
of
those
rights,
is
the
right
of
free
speech,
the
right
of
freedom
of
petition,
the
right
to
go
to
his
legislative
assembly
and
say,
i
want
this
because
i
am
entitled
to
it.
i
think
the
difference
again
highlights
the
essential
distinction
between
payment
to
a
parent
which
we
have
here,
payment
to
institution
which
we
have
in
lemon
and
kurtzman.
thank
you,
your
honors.
