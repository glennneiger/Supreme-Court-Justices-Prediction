justice
potter
stewart
did
you
say
that
the
district
court,
and
i
just
reread
it,
sorry,
glanced
over
its
decision
again,
i
can't
find
it
in
here,
that
the
district
court
held
that
the
$50.00
fee
was
not
itself
dis-chargeable
in
bankruptcy
and
will
remain
liability
of
the
debtor?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
didn't
see
that
in
its
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
since
you've
now
been
interrupted,
since
congress
has
left
it
up
to
this
court
in
this
general
order
in
bankruptcy
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
installment
payments,
whether
or
not
an
amended
general
order,
it's
the
new
general
order
that
has
to
deal
with
the
problems
in
this
case
or
at
least
go
far
toward
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
--
we
are
talking
about
the
statute
enacted
in
what
year?
justice
potter
stewart
provided
however
that
in
cases
of
voluntary
bankruptcy?
justice
potter
stewart
if
so
authorized
by
general
orders
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
could
make
it
$00.10
a
year
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
think
the
power
--
that
the
court
would
have
power
under
the
statute
by
general
order
to
say
that
there
is
going
to
be
discharged
prior
to
the
payment
of
the
whole
$50.00?m
justice
potter
stewart
no
state
has
constitutionally
required
to
have
statutes
permitting
divorce
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
there
is
anything,
i
don't
remember
anything
in
boddie
offhand
that
says
that
the
state
has
to
have
provision
for
dissolution
of
marriage.
i
believe
that
one
state
i
think
it
was
mississippi,
for
years
didn't
have
any
divorce,
you
have
maybe
in
south
carolina,
one
of
those
states
had
to
get
a
special
act
of
the
state
legislature
to
have
a
divorce,
and
i
don't
know
that
anybody
ever
attacked
that
situation
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view,
and
of
course
it
was
good
many
years
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
indeed,
and
the
state
might
determine
that
it's
not
going
to
permit
the
dissolution
of
that
fundamental
human
relationship.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
he
couldn't
pay
the
filing
fee
is
to
bring
some
law
suit
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
korman,
you
haven't,
unless
i
missed
it,
dealt
with
the
argument
under
the
statute,
28
u.s.c.
1915
(a)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
law
was
enacted
when?
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
was
1915
(a)
last
addressed
by
congress,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
has
been
the
holding,
but
wouldn't
you
agree
that
the
plain
language
of
1915
(a)
covers
this?
justice
potter
stewart
now
generally
or
at
least
the
old-fashioned
way
of
statutory
construction
was
that
if
the
plain
language
was
clear,
that
was
the
end
of
it,
you
didn't
look
at
the
legislative
history?
justice
potter
stewart
i
grant
you,
that's
a
little
bit
out
of
style?
justice
potter
stewart
and
assumes
the
ability
to
pay?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
1915
(a)
assumes
the
existence
of
a
pauper
who
is
not
able
to
pay?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
first
time
that
congress
has
done
a
silly
thing,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
broadly
has
1915
(a)
been
applied
in
the
district
courts,
do
you
know?
i
don’t
really
--
we
see
it
in
criminal
cases,
i
wondered
if
in
bringing
or
defending
civil
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
discharge
won’t
decide
whether
or
not
he
was
a
thief
or
has
any
bearing
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
nature
of
his
employment?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
given
any
though
to
whether
or
not
this
court
in
a
general
order
could
solve
this
situation
as
authorized
by
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
while
i
interrupted
you,
i
am
curious.
are
you
in
formal
pauperis
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
curious,
you
have
a
very
nicely
credit
brief
here
and
i
wondered
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
where
the
money
came
to
print
that?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
in
your
brief,
there
is
any
reliance
at
all
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
turn
the
--
the
lower
court
turned
it
out.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
came
earlier,
i
know
that
forma
pauperis
statute
goes
away
back,
but
--
there
was
a
bankruptcy
law
back
in
the
early
18th
or
19th
century?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
in
a
better
position
and
i
know
this.
has
1915
you
have
been
given
a
very
generous
application
--
justice
potter
stewart
both
as
a
plaintiff
as
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
kind
of
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
and
attainable
in
the
federal
court?
