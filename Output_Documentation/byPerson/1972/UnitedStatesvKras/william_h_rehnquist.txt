justice

rehnquist
mr.
korman,
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
is,
as
i
read
the
respondent's
affidavit,
he
does
state
that
one
of
the
reason
he
wants
to
be
able
to
file
a
petition
is
to
relieve
creditor
harassment.
so
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
concede
that
there
is
harassment
in
fact
and
to
contend
that
it
may
be
a
diminishing
factor
and
at
any
rate
it
could
be
settled
in
some
other
ways?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
more
accurately,
i
suppose
what
you
mean
is
they
can’t
make
the
promise
with
any
reasonable
expectation
of
performing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
finkel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
agree
that
your
client
probably
cannot
force
metropolitan
to
come
in
and
defend
the
merits
of
its
acquisitions
against
him
in
a
bankruptcy
court.
if
metropolitan
doesn’t
present
evidence
of
fraud,
that
debt
would
be
discharged
along
with
all
the
others,
but
metropolitan's
failure
to
appear
at
all,
for
example,
the
res
judicata
against
it
in
an
action
by
your
client,
say
for
slander
or
some
action
of
that
sort?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
it
is
not
an
adjudication
on
the
merits?
