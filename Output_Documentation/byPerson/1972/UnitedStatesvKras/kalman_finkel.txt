mr.
kalman
finkel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
ironic
considering
the
broad
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act
that
appellant
would
argue
that
mr.
kras
is
just
a
little
too
poor
to
be
entitled
to
a
bankruptcy
discharge.
i
would
like
to
briefly
focus,
since
appellant
has
not,
mr.
kras'
financial
plight
and
its
relationship
to
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
kras
can
be
characterized
as
a
man
who
is
down
on
his
luck.
he
was
last
steadily
employed
in
1969
for
an
insurance
company.
premiums
that
he
had
collected
were
stolen
from
his
home.
basically,
he
was
discharged
from
his
job
and
he
was
basically
accused
of
stealing
the
premiums.
each
time
he
went
to
apply
for
employment,
bad
references
of
the
insurance
company
followed
him.
meanwhile,
his
debts
began
to
accumulate,
he
was
harassed
by
creditors.
he
found
himself
on
public
assistance
and
his
wife
is
home
taking
care
of
a
handicapped
child.
this
is
a
man
who
can
be
characterized
as
completely
frustrated
and
a
failure.
he
sees
no
way
other
than
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
to
extricate
himself
from
his
present
plight.
this
man
is
a
natural
candidate
for
a
bankruptcy
discharge.
congress
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
act
understood
that
one
of
the
most
fundamental
liberties
an
individual
has
is
his
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
and
they
recognized
that
on
some
occasions
a
man
becomes
so
overwhelmed
by
debt,
so
harassed
by
creditors
that
he
becomes
immobilized,
that
he
has
nowhere
to
turn,
and
congress
enacted
the
bankruptcy
act,
not
in
the
narrow
reading
of
what
appellant
says,
not
merely
as
economic
relief,
the
interest
of
society
at
large
was
at
stake.
they
wanted
not
only
to
relieve
the
man
of
his
debts,
free
him
from
creditor
harassment,
they
were
interested
in
emancipating
him
from
his
debts
and
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
start
afresh.
mr.
kalman
finkel
but,
your
honor
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
as
a
practical
manner
perhaps,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
at
the
outset
that
this
individual
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
file
his
petition,
but
for
the
district
court
declaring
it
unconstitutional,
because
there
was
no
way
for
mr.
kras
to
promise
that
he
would
be
able
to
pay
in
six
months,
$40.00
or
$50.00.
that
petition
would
have
been
dismissed
immediately.
there
would
have
been
no
stay.
the
only
reason
there
is
a
stay
in
this
case
is
that
the
united
states
district
court
declared
the
fee
unconstitutional.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yeah,
there
are
situations
where
perhaps
that
has
happened,
but
in
this
particular
case
and
many
other
cases
that
we
represent
clients,
they
cannot
make
that
promise,
and
there
is
an
initial
fees
of
$10.00
that
they
also
do
not
have,
that
has
to
be
paid
immediately.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
they
don’t
know.
these
are
people
who
are,
you
know,
have
lived
with
debts
and
creditor
harassment
and
they
need
something
dramatic
to
give
them
a
chance,
and
that
dramatic
gesture
is
what
the
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is,
to
tell
him
that
he
is
discharged.
the
man
is
--
personally,
he
has
another
chance,
and
the
united
states
government
makes
a
laughing
matter
of
it,
but
he
has
a
chance
to
somehow
be
personally
vindicated.
he
has
been
accused
of
being
a
thief.
if,
and
as
happened,
the
insurance
company
does
not
come
into
the
bankruptcy
court,
that
debt
would
be
discharged.
personally
he
will
feel
vindicated.
now,
in
fact,
he
may
still
receive
bad
references
from
metropolitan,
but
that
personal
vindication
will
have
huge
psychological
implications
to
that
individual;
his
ability
to
earn
a
living,
to
become
rehabilitated
and
perhaps
a
productive
member
of
society,
and
the
mere
stay
just
doesn’t
accomplish
that
result.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
it
will
in
one
sense,
because
if
the
insurance
company
had
any
evidence
whatsoever
that
he
committed
a
fraud,
that
debt
would
survive
the
discharge
and
bankruptcy,
and
therefore
had
they
come
into
the
bankruptcy
court
and
prove
their
claim,
that
debt
would
have
survived.
the
fact
that
it
does
not
survive
now
gives
him
a
sort
of
personal
vindication.
mr.
kalman
finkel
$1016.00.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
metropolitan
will
do,
but
it
wouldn’t
be
surprising
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
would
say
no
your
honor,
it's
not
because
the
majority
of
bankruptcies
that
we
have
today
are
individuals
and
that's
the
reason
there
is
a
huge
financial
deficit
in
the
system,
are
individuals
with
income
with
less
than
$4,000.00
who
are
subjected
to
creditor
harassment
and
creditors
do
go
after
them
and
to
judgments.
some
of
them
by
the
way
are
default
judgments,
that
today
the
reason
that
the
system
is
not
any
longer
self-sufficient
--
self-sufficient
since
1969
is
that,
if
not
a
majority,
many
petitioners
are
people
with
gross
income
of
less
than
$4,000.00.
consumers,
the
bankruptcy
court
is
now
become
what
was
hopefully
designed
to
be
a
court
for
consumers
also,
not
only
for
business
people,
and
these
consumers
have
less
than
$4,000.00
in
gross
assets.
and
they
are
harassed,
there
are
judgments
against
them,
even
though
the
creditor
should
know
that
these
people
do
not
have
huge
sums
of
money.
in
fact,
i
should
also
point
out
that
congress
never
intended,
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
congress
intended
that
an
individual
such
as
mr.
kras
should
be
denied
a
bankruptcy
discharge,
or
that
he
was
too
poor.
what
happened
under
the
forma
pauperis
provisions
basically,
the
referees
were
extorting
money
from
the
indigents.
they
were
making
these
people
pay
because
that
went
into
their
fees,
where
they
got
--
some
couldn’t
pay
and
they
didn’t
get
the
discharge
of
this
pay,
and
congress
in
order
to
eliminate
this
inconsistent
and
unjust
result
setup
a
system
of
installment
payments.
but
there
is
no
legislative
finding
or
congressional
finding
that
an
individual
who
is
too
poor
for
a
discharge
is
not
entitled
to
a
statutory
right
to
a
discharge.
there
is
no
such
finding
in
congress.
in
fact,
today,
there
are
many
people
that
we
have
to
turn
away,
because
they
do
not
have
the
filing
fee
and
legal
aid
does
not
have
any
funds
for
it,
and
they
cannot
promise.
and
prior
to
this
case,
we
turned
away
many
people
at
our
trial
office
before
this
suit
was
brought,
because
we
just
--
there
is
no
funds
available
and
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
promise
to
pay
within
six
months,
and
then
you
have
to
get
another
extension
for
three
months,
so
it
was
not
quite
nine
months.
but
this
individual
is
caught
in
a
vicious
cycle,
and
because
he
is
so
overwhelmed
and
so
harassed,
he
has
no
where
to
turn,
it's
difficult
for
him
to
even
seek
employment.
he
is
defeated
and
exactly
what
the
bankruptcy
law
was
designed
to
do
was
to
say,
forget
the
debts,
forget
the
creditor
harassment,
now
we’re
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
start
over,
to
rehabilitate
yourself,
feel
free,
and
maybe
then,
not
only
will
the
debts
be
forgiven,
but
they’ll
be
forgotten.
if
we
get
to
all
the,
you
know,
the
hardships
that
he
had,
then
he
will
be
able
to
uplift
himself
and
try
for
a
job.
mr.
kalman
finkel
he
was
a
salesman
for
the
insurance
company,
and
after
that
he
was
only
able
to
find
odd
jobs,
equaling
about
$600.00.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
the
record
indicates
the
petitioner
--
that
he
has
applied
not
only
within
new
york
city,
but
he
has
gone
outside
the
city
to
seek
employment,
and
the
bad
references
of
metropolitan
he
claims
has
followed
him
outside
new
york
city.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
it
probably
will
follow
him,
but
once
discharged,
then
i
think
he
has
a
better
chance
of
bringing
a
civil
action
against
them
and
he
has
a
better
chance
of
explaining
it
to
an
employer
that
metropolitan
didn’t
see
fit
to
come
into
court
and
protect
that
interest
and
really
prove
their
case
that
maybe
it's
a
false
accusation,
i
don't
know.
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
think
it
may,
i
just
don’t
know,
but
i
think
it
has
--
i
think
personally
his
personal
sense
of
vindication,
that's
very
important,
will
have
an
impact
on
his
ability
to
proceed
and
obtain
employment.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
your
honor,
i
am
arguing
that
the
individual
is
--
there
is
a
procedural
bar
in
an
individual
statutory
discharge,
and
that
procedural
bar
violates
his
constitutional
right
to
be
heard
and
has
to
be
struck
down.
congress
setup
a
bankruptcy
act.
a
man
cannot
get
--
can’t
even
get
into
court
unless
he
pays
his
fee.
that
fee
has
applied
to
indigents
is
unconstitutional.
it
doesn’t
matter
how
reasonable
the
filing
fees.
in
boddie
versus
connecticut,
the
filing
fee
was
very
reasonable,
but
not
as
applied
to
indigents.
here
too,
the
bankruptcy
installment
fee
may
be
a
very
reasonable
thing,
but
not
as
applied
to
mr.
kras.
mr.
kalman
finkel
it
was
a
little
higher.
the
fee
here
your
honor
is
higher
than
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
it’s
not.
the
fee
maybe
--
a
state
may
setup
a
filing
fee
system
that
is
reasonable,
but
if
it
works
to
preclude
an
indigent's
access
to
court,
on
bounds,
it
becomes
unconstitutional
and
unreasonable
as
applied
to
that
indigent.
that's
what
happened
in
boddie,
it
wasn’t
the
amount
in
controversy.
the
fee
here
is
much
larger
than
the
forma
pauperis
application
in
both
the
trial
or
the
appellate
court
under
1915;
there
the
fees
are
only
$15.00
and
$25.00
for
pauperis.
and
here
we
have
a
much
greater
check
on
the
man’s
actual
poverty
on
the
formal
pauperis
1915,
there
is
hardly
a
check
to
determine
whether
the
man
is
truly
an
indigent.
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
gave
it
a
thought
about
20
minutes
ago,
your
honor,
when
you
asked
that
question.[attempt
to
laughter]
i
would
say
that
regardless
of
how
small
the
fee
is,
which
is
the
only
power
this
court
can
really
have,
because
i
think
the
statute
mandates
a
certain
fee
prior
to
discharge,
and
regardless
of
how
long
the
period
will
be,
it
will
still
be
insufficient,
it
would
be
contrarily
to
the
real
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
man
should
have
his
discharge
if
he
cannot
pay
it
without
any
payment
because
he
is
being
denied
his
opportunity
to
be
heard.
now,
in
boddie,
i
just
address
myself
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes.
mr.
kalman
finkel
it
comes
with
the
united
states
supreme
court.
we
are
forma
pauperis
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
your
honor,
we
don’t
know
where
his
authority
is,
but
we
have
no
trouble
with
it,
because
as
long
as
the
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
he
comes
out
with
this
debt
and
he
comes
out
with
the
debt
to
the
federal
government
of
$150.00
in
taxes
and
a
few
other
debts,
but
he
comes
out
with
a
complete
discharge.
mr.
kalman
finkel
right.
mr.
kalman
finkel
we
didn’t
object
to
that
part
of
the
order
that
was
inserted,
and
we
have
no
--
we
didn’t
object
to
it
upon
consideration,
we
might
in
the
future,
but
as
of
now
we
have
accepted
that.
he
would
survive
as
long
as
he
has
the
discharge.
mr.
kalman
finkel
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
taking
boddie,
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
all
filing
fee
cases
and
come
within
boddie,
because
this
individual
although
it’s
not
an
absolute
monopoly,
the
state
has
interposed
a
statutory
scheme
and
there
are
no
realistic
alternatives
for
mr.
kras.
he
cannot
offer
anything
in
settlement
for
his
claim.
with
respect
to
the
broader
question,
your
honor,
i
would
answer
yes,
unequivocally,
that
i
feel
that
all
filing
fees
that
bar
an
indigent's
access
to
court
in
the
first
instance
should
be
struck
down
as
relative
depressive.
i
don't
say
that
can
be
found
in
the
narrow
reading
of
boddie,
but
i
do
say
it
is
found
in
the
substance
of
due
process
on
the
right
to
be
heard,
and
that
that
individual's
right
goes
back
thousands
of
years.
under
the
roman
law
there
was
a
waiver
of
filing
fees.
almost
500
years
ago
in
the
statute
of
henry
xii,
there
were
provisions
for
waiver
of
filing
fees
for
indigent
plaintiffs
in
civil
cases.
there
were
also
provisions
for
counsel.
on
the
criminal
side,
we
have
given
much
more
than
bare
access.
we've
allowed
them
in
and
we've
given
all
the
instrumentalities
necessary
to
vindicate
their
legal
rights.
counsel,
free
transcript
of
the
minutes.
on
the
civil
side,
what
we're
basically
talking
about
is,
get
access
to
court,
which
i
feel
and
i
think
the
constitution
mandates
is
part
of
the
substance
of
due
process,
and
even
though
under
the
common
law
they
never
lived
up,
there
was
disparity
between
the
ideals
and
reality
of
the
system
of
justice
as
professor
mcguire
pointed
out
in
his
classic
article,
almost
50
years
ago,
most
of
the
problems
were
administrative.
the
courts
had
no
way
to
ferret
out
the
meritorious
from
the
frivolous
claims.
no
way
to
determine
who
was
really
an
indigent,
who
was
more
affluent.
today,
we
don’t
have
that
problem
administratively.
many
courts
already
have
waiver
of
filing
fees.
administratively,
there
can
be
a
provision
perhaps,
an
affidavit
of
merit.
if
the
indigent
is
represented
by
counsel
that
affidavit
can
be
more
thorough
and
more
extensive.
there
are
provisions
for
recoupment
in
case
of
recovery.
there
are
provisions
that
the
debt
can
survive.
there
are
penalties
for
perjury,
that
the
cost
would
not
be
that
high.
but
your
honors
regardless
of
what
the
court
does,
i
ask
your
honors
to
consider
the
other
side
of
the
claim,
the
cost
and
lost
of
personal
freedom
for
an
individual
that
doesn’t
has
his
day
in
court
is
immeasurable.
the
social
cost
to
a
society
where
there
is
no
lack
of
respect
to
the
judicial
system
is
staggering.
it
is
the
civil
courts
of
the
united
states
that
an
individual
has
the
right
to
defend
all
things
that
dear
to
him,
his
life,
his
liberty
and
property.
and
part
of
our
anglo
american
heritage
offense
and
equal
justice
on
the
law
that
it
should
be
a
meaningful
concept
and
not
a
mockery.
i
think
the
time
is
right
for
this
court
to
declare
that
a
man’s
right
to
be
heard
should
not
be
dependent
upon
the
size
of
his
pocketbook.
and
i
would
ask
that
the
court
consider
going
beyond
a
narrow
reading
of
body
and
a
broader
reading
of
the
due
process
clause
for
initial
access
to
the
court
to
strike
down
all
filing
fees
that
is
stand
in
the
way
of
an
indigent's
right
at
least
to
get
into
court
at
the
first
instance.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
there
is.
there
is
this
barrier
that
a
man
will
have
to
sign
an
affidavit
that
he
will
promise
to
pay
$50
in
six
months
that
he
may
not
be
able
to
pay.
mr.
kalman
finkel
he
is
in
court,
when
he
signs
that
affidavit,
that
will
be
totally
meaningless
on
the
empty
promise
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
your
honor
i
define
access
to
mean
that
the
individual
is
in
court
and
the
relief
he
seeks
he
can
obtain
without
any
financial
barriers.
that
is
the
way
i
would
define
initial
access
to
court.
the
fact
that
he
is
in
and
he
cannot
receive
any
relief
is
to
me
meaningless.
first,
he
is
not
really
in,
the
petition
will
not
be
considered
at
all
unless
he
makes
that
promise
and
i
am
not
sure,
the
very
few
debtors
that
will
be
willing
to
sign
a
sworn
affidavit
that
within
six
months,
they
know
they’re
going
to
have
$50
to
pay.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
your
honor,
we
don’t
know
and
i
checked
with
our
law
offices.
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
that
were
turned
away.
you
can
only
see
the
petitions
before
the
court,
the
once
that
the
people
promise,
but
the
thousands
of
poor
people
who
are
turned
away
by
legal
services
offices
because
they
don’t
know
that
they
will
have
a
job
and
refused
to
sign
that
and
there
is
no
other
way
to
be
paid
and
they
just
don’t
receive
their
discharge.
once
you’re
in
court,
that
is
only
a
minored
amount
that
the
people
who
need
a
bankruptcy
discharge.
there
are
thousands
of
other
people
who
need
this
discharge,
but
do
not
receive
it.
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
would
say
no
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
just
the
added
expenses.
it's
$4.5
million,
1971,
$2.5
million
a
few
years
ago.
i
don’t
think
it
has
anything
to
do,
not
that
much.
mr.
kalman
finkel
contributes,
but
negligible
and
not
to
override
the
individual's
right
to
be
there.
there
is
no
statistics
at
all
from
the
government
showing
in
anyway
what
the
loss
would
be.
there
are
none
whatsoever.
we
have
waited
for
those
statics
in
everyone
of
the
briefs
to
show
us
in
documentation.
what
they
have
argued
is
that
everybody
who
pays
an
installment
will
now
come
under
forma
pauperis,
that
may
not
be
so.
in
fact,
in
one
of
the
companion
case
in
the
southern
district
that
we
brought
after
we
lost,
the
referee
decided
against
us,
the
individual
obtained
the
employment
and
now
he
promised
to
pay
the
fee.
thank
you.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes
sir.
mr.
kalman
finkel
absolutely
not.
in
fact
that
is
one
of
the
factors
you
would
be
looking
for
if
metropolitan
has
not
come
in,
we
did
have
a
meeting
of
creditors
and
the
creditor
did
not
show
up.
the
only
thing
that
now
what
stands
in
the
way
of
the
discharge
is
the
fee.
we’ve
gone
through
the
entire
period
and
the
individual
is
unable
to
pay
the
fee.
either
he
gets
discharged
or
his
petition
gets
dismissed.
that’s
the
state
we're
in
right
now,
is
this
law
suit.
and
therefore,
when
he
--
when
in
fact
the
metropolitan
did
not
come
in
and
this
debt
is
discharged,
will
give
mr.
kras
an
opportunity
to
possibly
turn
around
and
possibly
sue
them
and
use
this
as
part
of
his
proof.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
it’s
not
an
adjudication
on
merits,
except
that
it
has
been
discharged
and
they
didn’t
come
into
prove
fraud.
that's
the
most,
i
think
we
can
say
about
it.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
in
the
lower
court,
we
did
your
honor.
it
was
rejected.
mr.
kalman
finkel
we
feel
that
1915
is
very
broadly
construed.
there
is
--
where
there
is
a
specific
statute
versus
the
general
statute
of
specific
one
covers
and
we
do
acknowledge
that
they
did
specifically
overrule
abolish
forma
pauperis
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
but
at
the
time
they
abolished
forma
pauperis
for
bankruptcy
in
1946
or
1948,
there
already
was
1915
on
the
books
and
they
past
what
would
the
installing
fees
which
all
lower
courts
have
considered
it
and
we
thought
they
were
right,
held
that
that
covered
the
point
and
therefore
bankruptcy
is
not
within
1915.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
other
than
the
bankruptcy
discharge,
i
know
of
no
other
federal
filing
fee
that
doesn’t
come
within
1915.
mr.
kalman
finkel
both
as
plaintiff
as
defendant
on
appeal,
both
civil
and
criminally.
mr.
kalman
finkel
any
kins
of
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes.
we’ve
perceived
at
many
times
in
various
cases
in
social
security
to
constitutional
attacks
and
the
whole
spectrum
of
cases,
we
perceive
4%
from
1915.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
we
don't
have
any
of
that
in
the
brief.
the
only
thing
that
i
refer
to
is
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
nlada
in
boddie
versus
connecticut
in
which
they
have
the
breakdown
of
filing
fee
costs
of
all
the
states.
i
mean
which
states
have
way
over
filing
fees.
they
have
no
--
they
have
been
unable
to
find
the
classic
articles,
50
years
old
the
mcguire's
and
since
then,
the
updating
articles,
i
have
been
unable
to
find
the
real
statistical
breakdown.
but
the
amicus
brief
that
we
cite
to
in
boddie
details
what
every
state
has
done
with
respect
to
waiver
of
the
filling
fees
and
many
states
have
given
that
relief
either
by
constitutional
law,
common
law,
or
statute
or
their
own
discretionary
powers.
mr.
kalman
finkel
today,
the
bankruptcy
deficit
is
so
enormous,
i
would
say
that
it
was
negligible
the
relationship
to
the
$50
fee.
it
is
$4.5
million,
and
1969,
it
was
self
sufficient.
so
you
determine
that
in
the
last
four
years
that
has
been
increased
deficit
than
the
filling
fee,
i
don’t
think
the
responsibility
because
people
have
been
paying
the
$50
for
getting
in.
so
they
have
collected
their
fee
and
those
who
haven’t
paid
just
didn’t
get
into
the
court
until
few
district
courts
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
kalman
finkel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
ironic
considering
the
broad
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act
that
appellant
would
argue
that
mr.
kras
is
just
a
little
too
poor
to
be
entitled
to
a
bankruptcy
discharge.
i
would
like
to
briefly
focus,
since
appellant
has
not,
mr.
kras'
financial
plight
and
its
relationship
to
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
kras
can
be
characterized
as
a
man
who
is
down
on
his
luck.
he
was
last
steadily
employed
in
1969
for
an
insurance
company.
premiums
that
he
had
collected
were
stolen
from
his
home.
basically,
he
was
discharged
from
his
job
and
he
was
basically
accused
of
stealing
the
premiums.
each
time
he
went
to
apply
for
employment,
bad
references
of
the
insurance
company
followed
him.
meanwhile,
his
debts
began
to
accumulate,
he
was
harassed
by
creditors.
he
found
himself
on
public
assistance
and
his
wife
is
home
taking
care
of
a
handicapped
child.
this
is
a
man
who
can
be
characterized
as
completely
frustrated
and
a
failure.
he
sees
no
way
other
than
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
to
extricate
himself
from
his
present
plight.
this
man
is
a
natural
candidate
for
a
bankruptcy
discharge.
congress
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
act
understood
that
one
of
the
most
fundamental
liberties
an
individual
has
is
his
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
and
they
recognized
that
on
some
occasions
a
man
becomes
so
overwhelmed
by
debt,
so
harassed
by
creditors
that
he
becomes
immobilized,
that
he
has
nowhere
to
turn,
and
congress
enacted
the
bankruptcy
act,
not
in
the
narrow
reading
of
what
appellant
says,
not
merely
as
economic
relief,
the
interest
of
society
at
large
was
at
stake.
they
wanted
not
only
to
relieve
the
man
of
his
debts,
free
him
from
creditor
harassment,
they
were
interested
in
emancipating
him
from
his
debts
and
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
start
afresh.
mr.
kalman
finkel
but,
your
honor
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
as
a
practical
manner
perhaps,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
at
the
outset
that
this
individual
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
file
his
petition,
but
for
the
district
court
declaring
it
unconstitutional,
because
there
was
no
way
for
mr.
kras
to
promise
that
he
would
be
able
to
pay
in
six
months,
$40.00
or
$50.00.
that
petition
would
have
been
dismissed
immediately.
there
would
have
been
no
stay.
the
only
reason
there
is
a
stay
in
this
case
is
that
the
united
states
district
court
declared
the
fee
unconstitutional.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yeah,
there
are
situations
where
perhaps
that
has
happened,
but
in
this
particular
case
and
many
other
cases
that
we
represent
clients,
they
cannot
make
that
promise,
and
there
is
an
initial
fees
of
$10.00
that
they
also
do
not
have,
that
has
to
be
paid
immediately.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
they
don’t
know.
these
are
people
who
are,
you
know,
have
lived
with
debts
and
creditor
harassment
and
they
need
something
dramatic
to
give
them
a
chance,
and
that
dramatic
gesture
is
what
the
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is,
to
tell
him
that
he
is
discharged.
the
man
is
--
personally,
he
has
another
chance,
and
the
united
states
government
makes
a
laughing
matter
of
it,
but
he
has
a
chance
to
somehow
be
personally
vindicated.
he
has
been
accused
of
being
a
thief.
if,
and
as
happened,
the
insurance
company
does
not
come
into
the
bankruptcy
court,
that
debt
would
be
discharged.
personally
he
will
feel
vindicated.
now,
in
fact,
he
may
still
receive
bad
references
from
metropolitan,
but
that
personal
vindication
will
have
huge
psychological
implications
to
that
individual;
his
ability
to
earn
a
living,
to
become
rehabilitated
and
perhaps
a
productive
member
of
society,
and
the
mere
stay
just
doesn’t
accomplish
that
result.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
it
will
in
one
sense,
because
if
the
insurance
company
had
any
evidence
whatsoever
that
he
committed
a
fraud,
that
debt
would
survive
the
discharge
and
bankruptcy,
and
therefore
had
they
come
into
the
bankruptcy
court
and
prove
their
claim,
that
debt
would
have
survived.
the
fact
that
it
does
not
survive
now
gives
him
a
sort
of
personal
vindication.
mr.
kalman
finkel
$1016.00.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
metropolitan
will
do,
but
it
wouldn’t
be
surprising
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
would
say
no
your
honor,
it's
not
because
the
majority
of
bankruptcies
that
we
have
today
are
individuals
and
that's
the
reason
there
is
a
huge
financial
deficit
in
the
system,
are
individuals
with
income
with
less
than
$4,000.00
who
are
subjected
to
creditor
harassment
and
creditors
do
go
after
them
and
to
judgments.
some
of
them
by
the
way
are
default
judgments,
that
today
the
reason
that
the
system
is
not
any
longer
self-sufficient
--
self-sufficient
since
1969
is
that,
if
not
a
majority,
many
petitioners
are
people
with
gross
income
of
less
than
$4,000.00.
consumers,
the
bankruptcy
court
is
now
become
what
was
hopefully
designed
to
be
a
court
for
consumers
also,
not
only
for
business
people,
and
these
consumers
have
less
than
$4,000.00
in
gross
assets.
and
they
are
harassed,
there
are
judgments
against
them,
even
though
the
creditor
should
know
that
these
people
do
not
have
huge
sums
of
money.
in
fact,
i
should
also
point
out
that
congress
never
intended,
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
congress
intended
that
an
individual
such
as
mr.
kras
should
be
denied
a
bankruptcy
discharge,
or
that
he
was
too
poor.
what
happened
under
the
forma
pauperis
provisions
basically,
the
referees
were
extorting
money
from
the
indigents.
they
were
making
these
people
pay
because
that
went
into
their
fees,
where
they
got
--
some
couldn’t
pay
and
they
didn’t
get
the
discharge
of
this
pay,
and
congress
in
order
to
eliminate
this
inconsistent
and
unjust
result
setup
a
system
of
installment
payments.
but
there
is
no
legislative
finding
or
congressional
finding
that
an
individual
who
is
too
poor
for
a
discharge
is
not
entitled
to
a
statutory
right
to
a
discharge.
there
is
no
such
finding
in
congress.
in
fact,
today,
there
are
many
people
that
we
have
to
turn
away,
because
they
do
not
have
the
filing
fee
and
legal
aid
does
not
have
any
funds
for
it,
and
they
cannot
promise.
and
prior
to
this
case,
we
turned
away
many
people
at
our
trial
office
before
this
suit
was
brought,
because
we
just
--
there
is
no
funds
available
and
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
promise
to
pay
within
six
months,
and
then
you
have
to
get
another
extension
for
three
months,
so
it
was
not
quite
nine
months.
but
this
individual
is
caught
in
a
vicious
cycle,
and
because
he
is
so
overwhelmed
and
so
harassed,
he
has
no
where
to
turn,
it's
difficult
for
him
to
even
seek
employment.
he
is
defeated
and
exactly
what
the
bankruptcy
law
was
designed
to
do
was
to
say,
forget
the
debts,
forget
the
creditor
harassment,
now
we’re
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
start
over,
to
rehabilitate
yourself,
feel
free,
and
maybe
then,
not
only
will
the
debts
be
forgiven,
but
they’ll
be
forgotten.
if
we
get
to
all
the,
you
know,
the
hardships
that
he
had,
then
he
will
be
able
to
uplift
himself
and
try
for
a
job.
mr.
kalman
finkel
he
was
a
salesman
for
the
insurance
company,
and
after
that
he
was
only
able
to
find
odd
jobs,
equaling
about
$600.00.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
the
record
indicates
the
petitioner
--
that
he
has
applied
not
only
within
new
york
city,
but
he
has
gone
outside
the
city
to
seek
employment,
and
the
bad
references
of
metropolitan
he
claims
has
followed
him
outside
new
york
city.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
it
probably
will
follow
him,
but
once
discharged,
then
i
think
he
has
a
better
chance
of
bringing
a
civil
action
against
them
and
he
has
a
better
chance
of
explaining
it
to
an
employer
that
metropolitan
didn’t
see
fit
to
come
into
court
and
protect
that
interest
and
really
prove
their
case
that
maybe
it's
a
false
accusation,
i
don't
know.
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
think
it
may,
i
just
don’t
know,
but
i
think
it
has
--
i
think
personally
his
personal
sense
of
vindication,
that's
very
important,
will
have
an
impact
on
his
ability
to
proceed
and
obtain
employment.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
your
honor,
i
am
arguing
that
the
individual
is
--
there
is
a
procedural
bar
in
an
individual
statutory
discharge,
and
that
procedural
bar
violates
his
constitutional
right
to
be
heard
and
has
to
be
struck
down.
congress
setup
a
bankruptcy
act.
a
man
cannot
get
--
can’t
even
get
into
court
unless
he
pays
his
fee.
that
fee
has
applied
to
indigents
is
unconstitutional.
it
doesn’t
matter
how
reasonable
the
filing
fees.
in
boddie
versus
connecticut,
the
filing
fee
was
very
reasonable,
but
not
as
applied
to
indigents.
here
too,
the
bankruptcy
installment
fee
may
be
a
very
reasonable
thing,
but
not
as
applied
to
mr.
kras.
mr.
kalman
finkel
it
was
a
little
higher.
the
fee
here
your
honor
is
higher
than
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
it’s
not.
the
fee
maybe
--
a
state
may
setup
a
filing
fee
system
that
is
reasonable,
but
if
it
works
to
preclude
an
indigent's
access
to
court,
on
bounds,
it
becomes
unconstitutional
and
unreasonable
as
applied
to
that
indigent.
that's
what
happened
in
boddie,
it
wasn’t
the
amount
in
controversy.
the
fee
here
is
much
larger
than
the
forma
pauperis
application
in
both
the
trial
or
the
appellate
court
under
1915;
there
the
fees
are
only
$15.00
and
$25.00
for
pauperis.
and
here
we
have
a
much
greater
check
on
the
man’s
actual
poverty
on
the
formal
pauperis
1915,
there
is
hardly
a
check
to
determine
whether
the
man
is
truly
an
indigent.
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
gave
it
a
thought
about
20
minutes
ago,
your
honor,
when
you
asked
that
question.[attempt
to
laughter]
i
would
say
that
regardless
of
how
small
the
fee
is,
which
is
the
only
power
this
court
can
really
have,
because
i
think
the
statute
mandates
a
certain
fee
prior
to
discharge,
and
regardless
of
how
long
the
period
will
be,
it
will
still
be
insufficient,
it
would
be
contrarily
to
the
real
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
man
should
have
his
discharge
if
he
cannot
pay
it
without
any
payment
because
he
is
being
denied
his
opportunity
to
be
heard.
now,
in
boddie,
i
just
address
myself
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes.
mr.
kalman
finkel
it
comes
with
the
united
states
supreme
court.
we
are
forma
pauperis
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
your
honor,
we
don’t
know
where
his
authority
is,
but
we
have
no
trouble
with
it,
because
as
long
as
the
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
he
comes
out
with
this
debt
and
he
comes
out
with
the
debt
to
the
federal
government
of
$150.00
in
taxes
and
a
few
other
debts,
but
he
comes
out
with
a
complete
discharge.
mr.
kalman
finkel
right.
mr.
kalman
finkel
we
didn’t
object
to
that
part
of
the
order
that
was
inserted,
and
we
have
no
--
we
didn’t
object
to
it
upon
consideration,
we
might
in
the
future,
but
as
of
now
we
have
accepted
that.
he
would
survive
as
long
as
he
has
the
discharge.
mr.
kalman
finkel
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
taking
boddie,
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
all
filing
fee
cases
and
come
within
boddie,
because
this
individual
although
it’s
not
an
absolute
monopoly,
the
state
has
interposed
a
statutory
scheme
and
there
are
no
realistic
alternatives
for
mr.
kras.
he
cannot
offer
anything
in
settlement
for
his
claim.
with
respect
to
the
broader
question,
your
honor,
i
would
answer
yes,
unequivocally,
that
i
feel
that
all
filing
fees
that
bar
an
indigent's
access
to
court
in
the
first
instance
should
be
struck
down
as
relative
depressive.
i
don't
say
that
can
be
found
in
the
narrow
reading
of
boddie,
but
i
do
say
it
is
found
in
the
substance
of
due
process
on
the
right
to
be
heard,
and
that
that
individual's
right
goes
back
thousands
of
years.
under
the
roman
law
there
was
a
waiver
of
filing
fees.
almost
500
years
ago
in
the
statute
of
henry
xii,
there
were
provisions
for
waiver
of
filing
fees
for
indigent
plaintiffs
in
civil
cases.
there
were
also
provisions
for
counsel.
on
the
criminal
side,
we
have
given
much
more
than
bare
access.
we've
allowed
them
in
and
we've
given
all
the
instrumentalities
necessary
to
vindicate
their
legal
rights.
counsel,
free
transcript
of
the
minutes.
on
the
civil
side,
what
we're
basically
talking
about
is,
get
access
to
court,
which
i
feel
and
i
think
the
constitution
mandates
is
part
of
the
substance
of
due
process,
and
even
though
under
the
common
law
they
never
lived
up,
there
was
disparity
between
the
ideals
and
reality
of
the
system
of
justice
as
professor
mcguire
pointed
out
in
his
classic
article,
almost
50
years
ago,
most
of
the
problems
were
administrative.
the
courts
had
no
way
to
ferret
out
the
meritorious
from
the
frivolous
claims.
no
way
to
determine
who
was
really
an
indigent,
who
was
more
affluent.
today,
we
don’t
have
that
problem
administratively.
many
courts
already
have
waiver
of
filing
fees.
administratively,
there
can
be
a
provision
perhaps,
an
affidavit
of
merit.
if
the
indigent
is
represented
by
counsel
that
affidavit
can
be
more
thorough
and
more
extensive.
there
are
provisions
for
recoupment
in
case
of
recovery.
there
are
provisions
that
the
debt
can
survive.
there
are
penalties
for
perjury,
that
the
cost
would
not
be
that
high.
but
your
honors
regardless
of
what
the
court
does,
i
ask
your
honors
to
consider
the
other
side
of
the
claim,
the
cost
and
lost
of
personal
freedom
for
an
individual
that
doesn’t
has
his
day
in
court
is
immeasurable.
the
social
cost
to
a
society
where
there
is
no
lack
of
respect
to
the
judicial
system
is
staggering.
it
is
the
civil
courts
of
the
united
states
that
an
individual
has
the
right
to
defend
all
things
that
dear
to
him,
his
life,
his
liberty
and
property.
and
part
of
our
anglo
american
heritage
offense
and
equal
justice
on
the
law
that
it
should
be
a
meaningful
concept
and
not
a
mockery.
i
think
the
time
is
right
for
this
court
to
declare
that
a
man’s
right
to
be
heard
should
not
be
dependent
upon
the
size
of
his
pocketbook.
and
i
would
ask
that
the
court
consider
going
beyond
a
narrow
reading
of
body
and
a
broader
reading
of
the
due
process
clause
for
initial
access
to
the
court
to
strike
down
all
filing
fees
that
is
stand
in
the
way
of
an
indigent's
right
at
least
to
get
into
court
at
the
first
instance.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
there
is.
there
is
this
barrier
that
a
man
will
have
to
sign
an
affidavit
that
he
will
promise
to
pay
$50
in
six
months
that
he
may
not
be
able
to
pay.
mr.
kalman
finkel
he
is
in
court,
when
he
signs
that
affidavit,
that
will
be
totally
meaningless
on
the
empty
promise
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
your
honor
i
define
access
to
mean
that
the
individual
is
in
court
and
the
relief
he
seeks
he
can
obtain
without
any
financial
barriers.
that
is
the
way
i
would
define
initial
access
to
court.
the
fact
that
he
is
in
and
he
cannot
receive
any
relief
is
to
me
meaningless.
first,
he
is
not
really
in,
the
petition
will
not
be
considered
at
all
unless
he
makes
that
promise
and
i
am
not
sure,
the
very
few
debtors
that
will
be
willing
to
sign
a
sworn
affidavit
that
within
six
months,
they
know
they’re
going
to
have
$50
to
pay.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
your
honor,
we
don’t
know
and
i
checked
with
our
law
offices.
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
that
were
turned
away.
you
can
only
see
the
petitions
before
the
court,
the
once
that
the
people
promise,
but
the
thousands
of
poor
people
who
are
turned
away
by
legal
services
offices
because
they
don’t
know
that
they
will
have
a
job
and
refused
to
sign
that
and
there
is
no
other
way
to
be
paid
and
they
just
don’t
receive
their
discharge.
once
you’re
in
court,
that
is
only
a
minored
amount
that
the
people
who
need
a
bankruptcy
discharge.
there
are
thousands
of
other
people
who
need
this
discharge,
but
do
not
receive
it.
mr.
kalman
finkel
i
would
say
no
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
just
the
added
expenses.
it's
$4.5
million,
1971,
$2.5
million
a
few
years
ago.
i
don’t
think
it
has
anything
to
do,
not
that
much.
mr.
kalman
finkel
contributes,
but
negligible
and
not
to
override
the
individual's
right
to
be
there.
there
is
no
statistics
at
all
from
the
government
showing
in
anyway
what
the
loss
would
be.
there
are
none
whatsoever.
we
have
waited
for
those
statics
in
everyone
of
the
briefs
to
show
us
in
documentation.
what
they
have
argued
is
that
everybody
who
pays
an
installment
will
now
come
under
forma
pauperis,
that
may
not
be
so.
in
fact,
in
one
of
the
companion
case
in
the
southern
district
that
we
brought
after
we
lost,
the
referee
decided
against
us,
the
individual
obtained
the
employment
and
now
he
promised
to
pay
the
fee.
thank
you.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes
sir.
mr.
kalman
finkel
absolutely
not.
in
fact
that
is
one
of
the
factors
you
would
be
looking
for
if
metropolitan
has
not
come
in,
we
did
have
a
meeting
of
creditors
and
the
creditor
did
not
show
up.
the
only
thing
that
now
what
stands
in
the
way
of
the
discharge
is
the
fee.
we’ve
gone
through
the
entire
period
and
the
individual
is
unable
to
pay
the
fee.
either
he
gets
discharged
or
his
petition
gets
dismissed.
that’s
the
state
we're
in
right
now,
is
this
law
suit.
and
therefore,
when
he
--
when
in
fact
the
metropolitan
did
not
come
in
and
this
debt
is
discharged,
will
give
mr.
kras
an
opportunity
to
possibly
turn
around
and
possibly
sue
them
and
use
this
as
part
of
his
proof.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
it’s
not
an
adjudication
on
merits,
except
that
it
has
been
discharged
and
they
didn’t
come
into
prove
fraud.
that's
the
most,
i
think
we
can
say
about
it.
mr.
kalman
finkel
well,
in
the
lower
court,
we
did
your
honor.
it
was
rejected.
mr.
kalman
finkel
we
feel
that
1915
is
very
broadly
construed.
there
is
--
where
there
is
a
specific
statute
versus
the
general
statute
of
specific
one
covers
and
we
do
acknowledge
that
they
did
specifically
overrule
abolish
forma
pauperis
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
but
at
the
time
they
abolished
forma
pauperis
for
bankruptcy
in
1946
or
1948,
there
already
was
1915
on
the
books
and
they
past
what
would
the
installing
fees
which
all
lower
courts
have
considered
it
and
we
thought
they
were
right,
held
that
that
covered
the
point
and
therefore
bankruptcy
is
not
within
1915.
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes,
other
than
the
bankruptcy
discharge,
i
know
of
no
other
federal
filing
fee
that
doesn’t
come
within
1915.
mr.
kalman
finkel
both
as
plaintiff
as
defendant
on
appeal,
both
civil
and
criminally.
mr.
kalman
finkel
any
kins
of
--
mr.
kalman
finkel
yes.
we’ve
perceived
at
many
times
in
various
cases
in
social
security
to
constitutional
attacks
and
the
whole
spectrum
of
cases,
we
perceive
4%
from
1915.
mr.
kalman
finkel
no,
we
don't
have
any
of
that
in
the
brief.
the
only
thing
that
i
refer
to
is
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
nlada
in
boddie
versus
connecticut
in
which
they
have
the
breakdown
of
filing
fee
costs
of
all
the
states.
i
mean
which
states
have
way
over
filing
fees.
they
have
no
--
they
have
been
unable
to
find
the
classic
articles,
50
years
old
the
mcguire's
and
since
then,
the
updating
articles,
i
have
been
unable
to
find
the
real
statistical
breakdown.
but
the
amicus
brief
that
we
cite
to
in
boddie
details
what
every
state
has
done
with
respect
to
waiver
of
the
filling
fees
and
many
states
have
given
that
relief
either
by
constitutional
law,
common
law,
or
statute
or
their
own
discretionary
powers.
mr.
kalman
finkel
today,
the
bankruptcy
deficit
is
so
enormous,
i
would
say
that
it
was
negligible
the
relationship
to
the
$50
fee.
it
is
$4.5
million,
and
1969,
it
was
self
sufficient.
so
you
determine
that
in
the
last
four
years
that
has
been
increased
deficit
than
the
filling
fee,
i
don’t
think
the
responsibility
because
people
have
been
paying
the
$50
for
getting
in.
so
they
have
collected
their
fee
and
those
who
haven’t
paid
just
didn’t
get
into
the
court
until
few
district
courts
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional.
