mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appeals
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
striking
down
as
unconstitutional,
an
act
of
congress,
which
required
the
payment
of
a
$50.00
filing
fee
as
a
condition
to
a
grant
of
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy.
the
district
court
held
that
the
statute
and
the
orders
in
bankruptcy
promulgated
by
this
court,
which
provide
that
the
filing
fee
may
be
paid
out
over
a
period
of
nine
months
--
up
to
nine
months
in
installments
after
the
filing
of
the
petition
were
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
an
asset-less
debtor
who
alleged
that
due
to
his
poverty
he
was
unable
to
promise
to
pay
the
filing
fee,
even
in
installments.
although
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
discharge
be
granted,
he
indicated
that
he
--
that
the
obligation
to
pay
the
$50.00
filing
fee
should
survive
the
discharge
and
be
paid
when
and
if
the
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
was
able
to
afford
it.
the
district
court
also
held
that
the
federal
in
forma
pauperis
statute,
28,
united
states
code
1915
(a)
was
inapplicable
here
since
congress
plainly
manifested
its
intent
to
abolish
in
forma
pauperis
proceedings
of
bankruptcy
and
substitute
in
its
place
a
system
of
installment
payments.
the
united
states
intervened
in
the
district
court
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
the
district
court
granted
a
stay
of
the
order
of
discharge
pending
the
resolution
of
this
appeal.
briefs
and
the
opinions
below
understandably
dwell
on
what
it
is
that
this
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
has
been
deprived
of
as
a
result
of
his
inability
to
pay
the
$50.00
filing
fee.
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
issues,
and
i
think
that
the
issues
raised
here
can
be
seen
in
their
proper
perspective
only
by
first
examining
what
it
is
that
congress
has
given,
an
indigent
asset-less
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
despite
his
inability
to
pay
this
$50.00
filing
fee.
initially,
it
must
be
observed
that
it
is
no
long
as
far
as
an
indigent
debtor
is
concerned,
this
is
no
longer
a
filing
fee
that
we
are
talking
about.
under
the
statute
the
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
may
file
his
petition
without
paying
any
fee
at
all,
provided
that
he
indicates
on
how
he
proposes
to
pay
that
filing
fee
in
installments
for
up
to
six
months,
and
the
period
may
be
extended
for
yet
an
additional
three
months.
now,
that
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
carries
significant
legal
consequences.
he
is
automatically
adjudged
to
be
a
bankrupt,
and
as
a
result
all
of
his
earnings
following
the
filing
of
the
petition
are
exempt
from
his
creditors.
and
so
what
congress
has
in
effect
said
to
an
asset-less
debtor,
said,
if
you
feel
that
you
have
earnings
that
you
want
to
immunize
from
the
reach
of
your
creditors,
you
can
file
your
petition.
you
will
have
up
to
nine
months
to
pay
and
as
those
earnings
which
you
expect
and
anticipate
come
in,
you
will
pay
us
out
this
$50.00
filing
fee
over
a
period
of
up
to
nine
months,
and
i
should
point
out
that
in
actuality
the
filing
fee
as
far
as
asset-less
debtors
go
is
really
$40.00,
$10.00
goes
to
the
trustee,
and
since
it
is
an
asset-less
debtor,
there
is
no
need
for
a
trustee.
on
the
other
hand,
if
as
this
petitioner
alleges,
he
does
not
anticipate
any
income,
he
does
not
anticipate
sufficient
income
to
pay
off
his
$50.00
or
$40.00
at
a
sum
of
about
a
dollar
a
week,
then
congress
may
rightly
inquire
why
it
is
that
he
needs
this
discharge
to
begin
with.
that
is,
the
discharge
becomes
meaningful
only
when
the
possibility
of
additional
assets
and
income
becomes
a
reality,
and
when
those
additional
assets
become
a
reality
then
the
$50.00
filing
fee
does
not
present
any
impediment
at
all
to
such
an
asset-less
debtor.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
if
he
doesn't
--
what
i
am
saying
justice
marshall,
if
he
doesn't
as
he
says,
expect
to
get
any
income,
his
welfare
benefits
are
exempt
from
his
creditors,
so
that
what
he
is
saying
is,
i
want
the
discharge,
the
reason
a
person
wants
a
discharge
is
so
that
any
future
earnings,
nonexempt
earnings
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
what
in
effect
congress
is
saying
is
that
when
you
need
it,
come
and
we
will
let
you
file
your
petition,
and
when
those
earnings
that
you
expect
and
you
want
to
immunize
become
a
reality,
as
those
earnings
come
in,
you
can
pay
us
out
this
$40.00
over
a
period
of
six
to
nine
months.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
appears
on
january
1
and
he
says,
i
don't
expect
to
have
any
income
for
the
next
six
months,
why
is
it
that
the
congress
can
may
rightly
ask,
why
it
is
that
this
gentleman
needs
a
discharge
to
begin
with?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
because
congress
has
decided
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
because
congress
has
just
decided
that
those
who
benefit
from
the
operation
of
the
bankruptcy
system
or
to
contribute
a
small
portion
of
the
cost
of
operating
it,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
while
the
congress
initially
intended
that
bankruptcy
system
be
self-sufficient
and
self-supporting,
because
of
the
increased
cost
and
the
failure
of
the
congress
to
increase
the
fee,
the
bankruptcy
system
is
now
running
at
a
deficit,
but
nevertheless
congress
has
a
legitimate
interest.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
is.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
did
operate
up
until
i
believe
1968,
it
operated
at
a
substantial
surplus.
at
the
moment
it's
operating
at
a
deficit
and
congress
is
in
fact
considering
now
that
it
is
operating
on
a
deficit
perhaps
repealing,
but
this
decision
to
abandon
in
forma
pauperis
petitions
in
bankruptcy,
which
was
made
in
1948,
was
based
on
a
congressional
finding
of
what
happened
during
the
years
when
in
forma
pauperis
applications
were
available.
what
happened
was
in
those
years
while
you
could
file
a
--
get
in
forma
pauperis
treatment
in
bankruptcy,
the
referees
were
paid
and
received
their
salary
only
out
of
the
fees
that
they
actually
collected.
the
referees
then
would
allow
the
petitioner
to
file
his
petition,
but
simply
refused
to
grant
them
the
discharge
until
they
were
paid.
and
what
congress
found
is,
is
that,
in
almost
every
case,
given
a
period
of
time
in
which
to
pay
out
the
filing
fees,
they
were
almost
invariably
paid.
so
congress
said,
that
seems
to
us
to
be
a
much
better
procedure
for
handling
these
in
forma
pauperis
petitions.
let
the
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
file
his
petition,
we
will
give
him
up
to
nine
months
to
pay,
and
then
he
can
obtain
his
discharge.
in
essence,
this
was
really
a
reasonable
substitute
for
the
in
forma
pauperis
proceedings
and
in
practice
it
does
not
operate
harshly,
in
practice
the
only
test
of
whether
you
get
a
discharge
or
not
is
need.
that
is,
if
you
need
the
discharge
because
you
expect
the
income,
you
can
file
your
petition
without
paying
anything,
and
as
that
income
which
you
anticipate
comes
in,
you
can
pay
out
this
filing
fee.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
as
this
petitioner
do
not
expect
to
have
any
income
to
pay
it
--
pay
this
$50.00,
then
you
really
do
not
need
the
discharge,
and
in
fact,
congress
is
really
saying,
our
bankruptcy
courts
are
overburdened
as
it
is,
when
you
need
the
discharge,
we
will
give
it
to
you.
now,
i
think
this
legislative
program
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
effort
on
the
part
of
congress
to
compromise
between
on
the
one
hand
the
indigent
debtor
and
on
the
other
hand
its
desire
to
see
that
those
who
benefit
from
a
particular
legislative
program
contribute
to
its
costs.
i
think
clearly
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this
classification
and
certainly
no
basis
to
strike
it
down
on
equal
protection
grounds
as
the
district
court
apparently
did.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it's
near
the
last
page
or
two
in
this
opinion
in
which
the
district
court
said
that.
i
think
that
is
an
implicit
recognition
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
statute
and
indeed
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
the
statute
in
this
classification
was
unreasonable
and
i
do
not
understand
--
my
advisory
here
to
argue
that.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct,
although
i
don't
know
where
the
district
court
thought
he
had
the
power
to
so
provide.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
because
i
believe
the
statute
provides
that
you
don't
get
the
discharge
until
you
actually
pay
the
fees
out
in
installments.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
the
1946
statute,
which
i
believe
appears
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
which
provides
that
the
court
shall
grant
a
discharge
unless
satisfied
that
the
bankrupt
has
failed
to
pay
the
filing
fees
required
to
be
paid
by
this
time
in
full.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
was
--
provided
then
the
fees
may
be
paid
in
installments,
but
first
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
what
i
think
the
court
can
do
is
extend
the
period
of
time,
make
it
a
year
for
the
installments,
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
suppose
that's
so.
there
is
no
limitations
as
i
see
in
the
statute
on
the
time
allotted
for
the
petitioner
to
make
the
payments.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
wouldn't
think
so,
and
the
particular
portion
of
the
statute
that
i
referred
to
is
section
14
(c)
(8),
which
appears
right
at
the
top
of
page
30.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct,
in
effect
what
congress,
as
i
tried
to
point
out
earlier,
in
effect,
congress
is
giving
the
indigent
asset-less
debtor
the
benefits
of
the
discharge
while
he
pays
out
the
money
that's
involved
here,
rather
small
sum.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
there
is
--
it's
different
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
what
we're
arguing
about
here
is
whether
or
not
the
congress
is
going
to
be
struck
down
as
unconstitutional.
i
think
that's
a
serious
question.
i
realize
that
conceivably
under
the
orders
of
this
court
the
period
of
time
in
which
a
person
has
to
pay
it
out
to
be
extended
for
quite
a
lengthy
period,
but
nevertheless,
there
may
be
a
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
as
a
matter
of
social
policy,
merely
to
say,
that
before
you
get
this
particular
benefit,
you
must
contribute
to
the
costs
of
the
operation
of
the
bankruptcy
system.
and
of
course
there
is
an
incentive
where
the
petitioner
is
getting
income
to
get
his
discharge
ultimately,
and
i
do
not
think
that
if
he
actually
has
the
money
and
income
is
coming
in,
he
is
not
going
to
deliberately
stall
the
payments
of
the
monies,
and
of
course
the
court
has
discretion
under
this
to
put
a
stop
to
any
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
debtor
where
it
fears
that
he
is
deliberately
stalling
and
delaying
the
payment
of
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
at
the
moment
that's
precisely
what
congress
is
studying,
whether
that
is
economically
feasible.
it's
not
economically
feasible
in
the
sense
that
we
can
go
out
and
check
each
and
every
case
to
determine
whether
the
petitions
that
are
filed
requesting
in
forma
pauperis
treatment
are
true,
and
in
effect,
in
almost
every
case
we
have
to
accept
all
of
these
allegations
as
true.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
may
be,
but
i
am
just
uncertain.
now,
the
district
court
held
--
did
not
hold,
nor
does
my
friend
here
argue
that
this
classification
is
unreasonable
or
that
it
involves
invidious
discrimination.
what
the
district
court
held
is
that
the
government
was
required
to
meet
a
compelling
interest
standard,
relying
on
cases
such
as
shapiro
versus
thompson,
and
we
submit
that
those
cases
are
holy
and
applicable
here.
those
cases
employ
the
compelling
interest
standard
where
a
particular
classification
infringed
upon
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
any
fundamental
constitutional
right.
congress
could
repeal
the
entire
bankruptcy
statute
tomorrow
or
the
discharge
provisions
tomorrow
without
raising
so
much
as
a
constitutional
ripple.
what
we
have
here
is
simply
a
benefit
that's
provided
by
congress
and
it's
clearly
improper
to
hold
that
congress
must
meet
a
compelling
interest
standard.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
qualify
that
by
saying
that
at
the
boddie
and
perhaps
griswold
versus
connecticut,
a
state
might
not
be
able
to
wholly
arbitrarily
deny
a
divorce.
i
would
think
that
they
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
it
in
boddie
there
is
rather
a
lengthy
discussion
of
what
is
involved
in
a
divorce,
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
--
it
involves
the
dissolution
of
a
rather
fundamental
human
relationship.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
i
think
there
were
two
aspects
to
the
boddie
holding,
as
there
must
be
since
boddie
was
a
due
process,
was
decided
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
of
course
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
due
process
required
a
court,
a
hearing
in
court,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
held
for
the
court,
that
it
must
have
been
because
he
decided
that
the
dissolution
of
this
fundamental
human
relationship
was
of
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause,
and
we
have
a
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause
and
the
state
saying
that
the
only
way
you
can
get
this
essential
liberty
is
to
come
into
the
courts.
you
can't
write
your
spouse
a
letter
and
say,
we're
divorced
and
you
can't
agree
to
it.
so
in
effect,
what
the
state
was
saying
in
divorce
cases
is
that,
in
order
to
get
this
fundamental
interest,
this
liberty
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
must
come
into
our
courts
said
justice
harlan,
under
those
circumstances
the
state
could
not
condition
the
right
to
dissolve
this
fundamental
human
relationship.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
a
debtor
and
creditor
can,
they
can
get
together
and
compromise
the
debt.
the
debt
can
be
simply
discharged
by
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
where
there
is
no
action
taken
to
enforce
it,
and
that's
not
a
wholly
unlikely
situation.
nobody
is
going
to
go
after
an
asset-less
debtor.
they
are
not
going
to
waste
as
much
as
a
nickel
to
attempt
to
enforce
their
claim
against
him,
and
as
i
read
the
petition
in
bankruptcy,
he
doesn't
really
allege
that
anyone
has
threatened
suit
against
him,
that
he
is
being
harassed.
but,
he
does
say
he
is
being
harassed
by
his
creditors,
but
the
harassment
that
he
speaks
of
is
simply
in
way
of
references
with
respect
to
his
character
rather
than
any
legal
proceedings
against
him.
so
that
no
one
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
am
not
assuming
that
people
on
welfare
are
not
--
i
am
assuming
that
people
who
are
asset-less
and
who
have
as
little
as
this
petitioner
claims
that
he
has,
it
would
be
somewhat
foolish
of
a
creditor
to
waste
his
money
in
an
attempt
to
invoke
the
judicial
process
to
obtain
funds.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
maybe
true,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
well,
the
harassment
that
i
was
speaking
of
was
in
the
real
situation,
whether
it
would
be
likely
that
a
debtor
--
a
creditor
would
bother
in
effect
to
go
after
him
in
a
judicial
proceeding
in
attempt
to
get
any
money
from
him,
since
he
is
not
working
and
he
obviously
has
no
assets.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
one
of
the
major
debts
about
which
this
petitioner
complains
is
thousand
dollar
debt
to
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company,
which
he
claims
they
say
he
stole
from
them,
and
therefore
they
have
an
action
converging
against
him.
now,
the
new
york
statute
of
limitations
for
an
action
in
conversion
is
three
years.
according
to
the
petition,
the
the
conversion,
act
of
conversion
alleged,
that
took
place
in
may
of
1969,
probably
he
has
been
discharged
already
by
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
that
unlike
boddie,
and
i
think
there
were
two
essential
distinctions
here,
both
crucial
points
of
boddie.
in
the
first
place
the
state
has
not
monopolized
the
means
of
dissolving
this
debtor-creditor
--
this
particular
relationship.
it
can
be
dissolved
by
the
parties
themselves,
the
debt
can
be
compromised,
and
indeed
it
could
be
discharged
simply
by
inaction
of
the
creditor
over
a
period
of
time
until
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
out,
and
in
the
second
place,
as
far
as
an
asset-less
debtor
goes,
certainly,
the
right
that's
involved
here
hardly
approaches
an
importance
and
significance,
the
right
of
an
individual
to
decide
whether
he
is
going
to
live
with
another
person
in
the
institution
of
marriage
and
indeed
the
right
to
remarry
again.
and
so
that
on
those
two
essential
grounds
we
feel
that
boddie
is
inapplicable
here
and
indeed
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court,
although
he
cited
boddie
a
good
deal,
did
not
really
rely
on
the
language
in
justice
harlan's
opinion,
but
relied
instead
on
the
concurring
opinions
and
on
justice
black’s
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari
on
the
garland
case,
which
was
a
case
in
which
the
first
circuit
upheld
the
$50.00
filing
fee,
and
this
court
denied
cert
almost
immediately
after
the
decision
in
boddie.
and
this
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
that
the
district
court
i
believe
cited
in
effect
unequivocally
stated
that
it
rejected
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
opinion
in
boddie.
and
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
there
is
very
little
in
boddie
when
it's
out
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
supports
petitioner’s
contention
--
petitioner
of
bankruptcy's
contention
here.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it's
a
diminishing
factor,
i
think
when
read
in
context,
when
you
look
at
the
next
sentence
that
follows
that.
the
kind
of
harassment
he
was
talking
about
was
in
fact
that
metropolitan
life
insurance
company,
whenever
he
gives
that
company
as
a
reference,
seek
employment,
says
to
the
prospective
employer
that
this
fellow
was
a
thief.
now,
how
a
discharge
of
bankruptcy
is
going
to
help
him,
i
don't
know,
but
if
you
look
at
page
13
of
the
brief,
what
he
says
is,
that
since
metropolitan
--
now,
if
he
gets
the
discharge
says
he,
it's
true
that
metropolitan
would
still
continue
to
tell
prospective
employers
that
he
is
a
thief,
but
says
he,
since
metropolitan
did
not
appear
before
the
referee
to
contest
the
debt,
appellee’s
discharge
in
bankruptcy
will
not
only
erase
this
debt,
but
will
hopefully
remove
the
unwarranted
stigma
that
operates
as
an
albatross
around
his
neck,
because
he
says
metropolitan
will
have
to
explain
why
it
is
they
didn't
appear
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
contest
the
discharge.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
until
he
anticipates
getting
it.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
as
soon
as
he
gets
a
job
or
he
is
offered
a
job,
he
can
come
in
and
file
his
bankruptcy
petition
and
that
will
in
effect
immunize
his
earnings
after
the
petition
is
filed.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
assume
that
--
i
am
thinking
about
as
a
practical
matter,
if
an
employer
was
offering
him
a
job
and
said,
well,
you
have
this
thousand
dollar
judgment
against
you,
i
am
not
going
to
hire
you.
he
can
say,
well,
if
that's
the
only
impediment,
i
will
file
a
bankruptcy
petition
tomorrow
and
that
will
resolve
the
problem.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
was
listed
as
a
debt
that
he
wanted
to
have
discharged,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
don't
know
justice
powell
that
new
york
allows
such
course
of
action.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
and
i
am
not
familiar
enough,
quite
frankly,
with
whether
under
the
bankruptcy
law
such
a
contingency
would
be
considered
an
asset.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
there
is
what
we
call
is
--
there
is
a
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute.
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
exception
to
that
statute,
which
is
based
on
a
congressional
finding
that
there
is
simply
another
and
a
better
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
in
forma
pauperis
applicants
in
bankruptcy
proceedings,
and
that
better
way
is
simply
you
have
the
asset-less
debtor
file
his
petition
and
pay
it
out
in
installments,
that
filing
of
the
petition
is
based
and
a
need
for
the
discharge
is
based
on
his
assumed
expectations
of
earnings,
and
for
these
reasons
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reversed.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
the
district
court
--
i
am
sorry,
the
district
court
said
that
the
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
you
can't
get
the
discharge
in
bankruptcy
until
you
pay
the
fee
in
each
challenge.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
when
he
filed
--
right,
and
he
said
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
either
prepayment
or
a
statement
of
indigency
with
a
proposed
plan
to
pay
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it
would
have
demanded
prepayment
or
a
statement
of
how
he
proposed
to
pay
in
installments,
and
he
said
that
he
could
make
no
promise
to
pay
in
installments.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
and
you
get
all
the
advantages
of
the
adjudication.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
the
reason
i
hadn't
mr.
justice
stewart
is
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
holding
of
the
district
court
is
contested.
the
legislative
history
is
rather
clear
on
the
issue.
it
clearly
indicates
the
intent
of
congress
to
abolish
in
forma
pauperis
proceedings
of
bankruptcy.
every
court
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
1946
i
believe.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don't
know.
i
know
that
there
was
a
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
in
effect
in
1898
when
congress
initially
provided
for
in
forma
pauperis
treatment
of
bankruptcy,
and
i
think
probably
the
fact
that
congress
felt
that
it
needed
a
special
statute
for
the
bankruptcy
act,
initially,
would
indicate
that
the
congress
was
not
of
the
view
that
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
applied
to
bankruptcy
proceedings.
but
as
a
general
matter,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
legislative
history
and
every
court
mr.
justice
stewart,
even
the
courts
that
have
struck
the
statute
down,
has
held
that
the
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
has
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
i
will
have
to
agree
that
the
plain
language
does
seem
to
cover
it,
if
you
don't
consider
the
particular
legislative
history
involved
here.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
but
there
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
but
the
language
of
the
statute
clearly
indicates
that
congress
did
not
want
the
discharge
to
be
granted
till
the
filing
fees
were
paid
in
the
the
legislative
history.
and
the
rules
of
this
court,
i
would
add,
the
orders
of
bankruptcy
which
were
based
on
the
statute
so
read
it.
it
said,
no
discharge
until
the
filing
fees
are
paid
and
the
legislative
history
clearly
assumes
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
assumes
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
the
rules
did
not
assume
an
ability
to
pay
initially,
that
is
on
the
show
that
you
are
a
pauper
in
order
to
get
this
benefit
of
installment
payments,
and
i
think
congress
clearly
--
it
would
be
somewhat
silly
for
congress
to
say
you
have
to
show
you
are
a
pauper
before
you
could
get
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it
wouldn't,
but
it
would
in
any
event
seem
somewhat
silly
for
congress
to
say
that
you
have
to
file
a
--
you
have
to
make
a
statement
of
indigency
before
you
can
get
benefit
of
an
installment
payment,
and
then
on
the
other
hand
contemplate
that
a
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
would
apply,
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
anything
except
file
the
petition
and
the
affidavit
of
indigency.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it
has
been
applied
broadly
except
in
this
area
where
the
--
all
of
the
lower
courts,
almost
--
i
don't
know
the
decision
the
other
way,
have
held
that
the
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
is
inapplicable
here.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appeals
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
striking
down
as
unconstitutional,
an
act
of
congress,
which
required
the
payment
of
a
$50.00
filing
fee
as
a
condition
to
a
grant
of
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy.
the
district
court
held
that
the
statute
and
the
orders
in
bankruptcy
promulgated
by
this
court,
which
provide
that
the
filing
fee
may
be
paid
out
over
a
period
of
nine
months
--
up
to
nine
months
in
installments
after
the
filing
of
the
petition
were
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
an
asset-less
debtor
who
alleged
that
due
to
his
poverty
he
was
unable
to
promise
to
pay
the
filing
fee,
even
in
installments.
although
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
discharge
be
granted,
he
indicated
that
he
--
that
the
obligation
to
pay
the
$50.00
filing
fee
should
survive
the
discharge
and
be
paid
when
and
if
the
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
was
able
to
afford
it.
the
district
court
also
held
that
the
federal
in
forma
pauperis
statute,
28,
united
states
code
1915
(a)
was
inapplicable
here
since
congress
plainly
manifested
its
intent
to
abolish
in
forma
pauperis
proceedings
of
bankruptcy
and
substitute
in
its
place
a
system
of
installment
payments.
the
united
states
intervened
in
the
district
court
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
the
district
court
granted
a
stay
of
the
order
of
discharge
pending
the
resolution
of
this
appeal.
briefs
and
the
opinions
below
understandably
dwell
on
what
it
is
that
this
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
has
been
deprived
of
as
a
result
of
his
inability
to
pay
the
$50.00
filing
fee.
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
issues,
and
i
think
that
the
issues
raised
here
can
be
seen
in
their
proper
perspective
only
by
first
examining
what
it
is
that
congress
has
given,
an
indigent
asset-less
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
despite
his
inability
to
pay
this
$50.00
filing
fee.
initially,
it
must
be
observed
that
it
is
no
long
as
far
as
an
indigent
debtor
is
concerned,
this
is
no
longer
a
filing
fee
that
we
are
talking
about.
under
the
statute
the
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
may
file
his
petition
without
paying
any
fee
at
all,
provided
that
he
indicates
on
how
he
proposes
to
pay
that
filing
fee
in
installments
for
up
to
six
months,
and
the
period
may
be
extended
for
yet
an
additional
three
months.
now,
that
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
carries
significant
legal
consequences.
he
is
automatically
adjudged
to
be
a
bankrupt,
and
as
a
result
all
of
his
earnings
following
the
filing
of
the
petition
are
exempt
from
his
creditors.
and
so
what
congress
has
in
effect
said
to
an
asset-less
debtor,
said,
if
you
feel
that
you
have
earnings
that
you
want
to
immunize
from
the
reach
of
your
creditors,
you
can
file
your
petition.
you
will
have
up
to
nine
months
to
pay
and
as
those
earnings
which
you
expect
and
anticipate
come
in,
you
will
pay
us
out
this
$50.00
filing
fee
over
a
period
of
up
to
nine
months,
and
i
should
point
out
that
in
actuality
the
filing
fee
as
far
as
asset-less
debtors
go
is
really
$40.00,
$10.00
goes
to
the
trustee,
and
since
it
is
an
asset-less
debtor,
there
is
no
need
for
a
trustee.
on
the
other
hand,
if
as
this
petitioner
alleges,
he
does
not
anticipate
any
income,
he
does
not
anticipate
sufficient
income
to
pay
off
his
$50.00
or
$40.00
at
a
sum
of
about
a
dollar
a
week,
then
congress
may
rightly
inquire
why
it
is
that
he
needs
this
discharge
to
begin
with.
that
is,
the
discharge
becomes
meaningful
only
when
the
possibility
of
additional
assets
and
income
becomes
a
reality,
and
when
those
additional
assets
become
a
reality
then
the
$50.00
filing
fee
does
not
present
any
impediment
at
all
to
such
an
asset-less
debtor.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
if
he
doesn't
--
what
i
am
saying
justice
marshall,
if
he
doesn't
as
he
says,
expect
to
get
any
income,
his
welfare
benefits
are
exempt
from
his
creditors,
so
that
what
he
is
saying
is,
i
want
the
discharge,
the
reason
a
person
wants
a
discharge
is
so
that
any
future
earnings,
nonexempt
earnings
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
what
in
effect
congress
is
saying
is
that
when
you
need
it,
come
and
we
will
let
you
file
your
petition,
and
when
those
earnings
that
you
expect
and
you
want
to
immunize
become
a
reality,
as
those
earnings
come
in,
you
can
pay
us
out
this
$40.00
over
a
period
of
six
to
nine
months.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
appears
on
january
1
and
he
says,
i
don't
expect
to
have
any
income
for
the
next
six
months,
why
is
it
that
the
congress
can
may
rightly
ask,
why
it
is
that
this
gentleman
needs
a
discharge
to
begin
with?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
because
congress
has
decided
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
because
congress
has
just
decided
that
those
who
benefit
from
the
operation
of
the
bankruptcy
system
or
to
contribute
a
small
portion
of
the
cost
of
operating
it,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
while
the
congress
initially
intended
that
bankruptcy
system
be
self-sufficient
and
self-supporting,
because
of
the
increased
cost
and
the
failure
of
the
congress
to
increase
the
fee,
the
bankruptcy
system
is
now
running
at
a
deficit,
but
nevertheless
congress
has
a
legitimate
interest.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
is.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
did
operate
up
until
i
believe
1968,
it
operated
at
a
substantial
surplus.
at
the
moment
it's
operating
at
a
deficit
and
congress
is
in
fact
considering
now
that
it
is
operating
on
a
deficit
perhaps
repealing,
but
this
decision
to
abandon
in
forma
pauperis
petitions
in
bankruptcy,
which
was
made
in
1948,
was
based
on
a
congressional
finding
of
what
happened
during
the
years
when
in
forma
pauperis
applications
were
available.
what
happened
was
in
those
years
while
you
could
file
a
--
get
in
forma
pauperis
treatment
in
bankruptcy,
the
referees
were
paid
and
received
their
salary
only
out
of
the
fees
that
they
actually
collected.
the
referees
then
would
allow
the
petitioner
to
file
his
petition,
but
simply
refused
to
grant
them
the
discharge
until
they
were
paid.
and
what
congress
found
is,
is
that,
in
almost
every
case,
given
a
period
of
time
in
which
to
pay
out
the
filing
fees,
they
were
almost
invariably
paid.
so
congress
said,
that
seems
to
us
to
be
a
much
better
procedure
for
handling
these
in
forma
pauperis
petitions.
let
the
petitioner
of
bankruptcy
file
his
petition,
we
will
give
him
up
to
nine
months
to
pay,
and
then
he
can
obtain
his
discharge.
in
essence,
this
was
really
a
reasonable
substitute
for
the
in
forma
pauperis
proceedings
and
in
practice
it
does
not
operate
harshly,
in
practice
the
only
test
of
whether
you
get
a
discharge
or
not
is
need.
that
is,
if
you
need
the
discharge
because
you
expect
the
income,
you
can
file
your
petition
without
paying
anything,
and
as
that
income
which
you
anticipate
comes
in,
you
can
pay
out
this
filing
fee.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
as
this
petitioner
do
not
expect
to
have
any
income
to
pay
it
--
pay
this
$50.00,
then
you
really
do
not
need
the
discharge,
and
in
fact,
congress
is
really
saying,
our
bankruptcy
courts
are
overburdened
as
it
is,
when
you
need
the
discharge,
we
will
give
it
to
you.
now,
i
think
this
legislative
program
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
effort
on
the
part
of
congress
to
compromise
between
on
the
one
hand
the
indigent
debtor
and
on
the
other
hand
its
desire
to
see
that
those
who
benefit
from
a
particular
legislative
program
contribute
to
its
costs.
i
think
clearly
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this
classification
and
certainly
no
basis
to
strike
it
down
on
equal
protection
grounds
as
the
district
court
apparently
did.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it's
near
the
last
page
or
two
in
this
opinion
in
which
the
district
court
said
that.
i
think
that
is
an
implicit
recognition
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
statute
and
indeed
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
the
statute
in
this
classification
was
unreasonable
and
i
do
not
understand
--
my
advisory
here
to
argue
that.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct,
although
i
don't
know
where
the
district
court
thought
he
had
the
power
to
so
provide.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
because
i
believe
the
statute
provides
that
you
don't
get
the
discharge
until
you
actually
pay
the
fees
out
in
installments.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
the
1946
statute,
which
i
believe
appears
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
which
provides
that
the
court
shall
grant
a
discharge
unless
satisfied
that
the
bankrupt
has
failed
to
pay
the
filing
fees
required
to
be
paid
by
this
time
in
full.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
was
--
provided
then
the
fees
may
be
paid
in
installments,
but
first
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
what
i
think
the
court
can
do
is
extend
the
period
of
time,
make
it
a
year
for
the
installments,
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
suppose
that's
so.
there
is
no
limitations
as
i
see
in
the
statute
on
the
time
allotted
for
the
petitioner
to
make
the
payments.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
wouldn't
think
so,
and
the
particular
portion
of
the
statute
that
i
referred
to
is
section
14
(c)
(8),
which
appears
right
at
the
top
of
page
30.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct,
in
effect
what
congress,
as
i
tried
to
point
out
earlier,
in
effect,
congress
is
giving
the
indigent
asset-less
debtor
the
benefits
of
the
discharge
while
he
pays
out
the
money
that's
involved
here,
rather
small
sum.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
there
is
--
it's
different
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
what
we're
arguing
about
here
is
whether
or
not
the
congress
is
going
to
be
struck
down
as
unconstitutional.
i
think
that's
a
serious
question.
i
realize
that
conceivably
under
the
orders
of
this
court
the
period
of
time
in
which
a
person
has
to
pay
it
out
to
be
extended
for
quite
a
lengthy
period,
but
nevertheless,
there
may
be
a
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
as
a
matter
of
social
policy,
merely
to
say,
that
before
you
get
this
particular
benefit,
you
must
contribute
to
the
costs
of
the
operation
of
the
bankruptcy
system.
and
of
course
there
is
an
incentive
where
the
petitioner
is
getting
income
to
get
his
discharge
ultimately,
and
i
do
not
think
that
if
he
actually
has
the
money
and
income
is
coming
in,
he
is
not
going
to
deliberately
stall
the
payments
of
the
monies,
and
of
course
the
court
has
discretion
under
this
to
put
a
stop
to
any
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
debtor
where
it
fears
that
he
is
deliberately
stalling
and
delaying
the
payment
of
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
at
the
moment
that's
precisely
what
congress
is
studying,
whether
that
is
economically
feasible.
it's
not
economically
feasible
in
the
sense
that
we
can
go
out
and
check
each
and
every
case
to
determine
whether
the
petitions
that
are
filed
requesting
in
forma
pauperis
treatment
are
true,
and
in
effect,
in
almost
every
case
we
have
to
accept
all
of
these
allegations
as
true.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
may
be,
but
i
am
just
uncertain.
now,
the
district
court
held
--
did
not
hold,
nor
does
my
friend
here
argue
that
this
classification
is
unreasonable
or
that
it
involves
invidious
discrimination.
what
the
district
court
held
is
that
the
government
was
required
to
meet
a
compelling
interest
standard,
relying
on
cases
such
as
shapiro
versus
thompson,
and
we
submit
that
those
cases
are
holy
and
applicable
here.
those
cases
employ
the
compelling
interest
standard
where
a
particular
classification
infringed
upon
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
any
fundamental
constitutional
right.
congress
could
repeal
the
entire
bankruptcy
statute
tomorrow
or
the
discharge
provisions
tomorrow
without
raising
so
much
as
a
constitutional
ripple.
what
we
have
here
is
simply
a
benefit
that's
provided
by
congress
and
it's
clearly
improper
to
hold
that
congress
must
meet
a
compelling
interest
standard.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
qualify
that
by
saying
that
at
the
boddie
and
perhaps
griswold
versus
connecticut,
a
state
might
not
be
able
to
wholly
arbitrarily
deny
a
divorce.
i
would
think
that
they
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
it
in
boddie
there
is
rather
a
lengthy
discussion
of
what
is
involved
in
a
divorce,
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
--
it
involves
the
dissolution
of
a
rather
fundamental
human
relationship.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
i
think
there
were
two
aspects
to
the
boddie
holding,
as
there
must
be
since
boddie
was
a
due
process,
was
decided
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
of
course
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
due
process
required
a
court,
a
hearing
in
court,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
held
for
the
court,
that
it
must
have
been
because
he
decided
that
the
dissolution
of
this
fundamental
human
relationship
was
of
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause,
and
we
have
a
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause
and
the
state
saying
that
the
only
way
you
can
get
this
essential
liberty
is
to
come
into
the
courts.
you
can't
write
your
spouse
a
letter
and
say,
we're
divorced
and
you
can't
agree
to
it.
so
in
effect,
what
the
state
was
saying
in
divorce
cases
is
that,
in
order
to
get
this
fundamental
interest,
this
liberty
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
must
come
into
our
courts
said
justice
harlan,
under
those
circumstances
the
state
could
not
condition
the
right
to
dissolve
this
fundamental
human
relationship.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
a
debtor
and
creditor
can,
they
can
get
together
and
compromise
the
debt.
the
debt
can
be
simply
discharged
by
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
where
there
is
no
action
taken
to
enforce
it,
and
that's
not
a
wholly
unlikely
situation.
nobody
is
going
to
go
after
an
asset-less
debtor.
they
are
not
going
to
waste
as
much
as
a
nickel
to
attempt
to
enforce
their
claim
against
him,
and
as
i
read
the
petition
in
bankruptcy,
he
doesn't
really
allege
that
anyone
has
threatened
suit
against
him,
that
he
is
being
harassed.
but,
he
does
say
he
is
being
harassed
by
his
creditors,
but
the
harassment
that
he
speaks
of
is
simply
in
way
of
references
with
respect
to
his
character
rather
than
any
legal
proceedings
against
him.
so
that
no
one
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
am
not
assuming
that
people
on
welfare
are
not
--
i
am
assuming
that
people
who
are
asset-less
and
who
have
as
little
as
this
petitioner
claims
that
he
has,
it
would
be
somewhat
foolish
of
a
creditor
to
waste
his
money
in
an
attempt
to
invoke
the
judicial
process
to
obtain
funds.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that
maybe
true,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
well,
the
harassment
that
i
was
speaking
of
was
in
the
real
situation,
whether
it
would
be
likely
that
a
debtor
--
a
creditor
would
bother
in
effect
to
go
after
him
in
a
judicial
proceeding
in
attempt
to
get
any
money
from
him,
since
he
is
not
working
and
he
obviously
has
no
assets.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
one
of
the
major
debts
about
which
this
petitioner
complains
is
thousand
dollar
debt
to
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company,
which
he
claims
they
say
he
stole
from
them,
and
therefore
they
have
an
action
converging
against
him.
now,
the
new
york
statute
of
limitations
for
an
action
in
conversion
is
three
years.
according
to
the
petition,
the
the
conversion,
act
of
conversion
alleged,
that
took
place
in
may
of
1969,
probably
he
has
been
discharged
already
by
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
that
unlike
boddie,
and
i
think
there
were
two
essential
distinctions
here,
both
crucial
points
of
boddie.
in
the
first
place
the
state
has
not
monopolized
the
means
of
dissolving
this
debtor-creditor
--
this
particular
relationship.
it
can
be
dissolved
by
the
parties
themselves,
the
debt
can
be
compromised,
and
indeed
it
could
be
discharged
simply
by
inaction
of
the
creditor
over
a
period
of
time
until
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
out,
and
in
the
second
place,
as
far
as
an
asset-less
debtor
goes,
certainly,
the
right
that's
involved
here
hardly
approaches
an
importance
and
significance,
the
right
of
an
individual
to
decide
whether
he
is
going
to
live
with
another
person
in
the
institution
of
marriage
and
indeed
the
right
to
remarry
again.
and
so
that
on
those
two
essential
grounds
we
feel
that
boddie
is
inapplicable
here
and
indeed
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court,
although
he
cited
boddie
a
good
deal,
did
not
really
rely
on
the
language
in
justice
harlan's
opinion,
but
relied
instead
on
the
concurring
opinions
and
on
justice
black’s
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari
on
the
garland
case,
which
was
a
case
in
which
the
first
circuit
upheld
the
$50.00
filing
fee,
and
this
court
denied
cert
almost
immediately
after
the
decision
in
boddie.
and
this
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
that
the
district
court
i
believe
cited
in
effect
unequivocally
stated
that
it
rejected
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
opinion
in
boddie.
and
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
there
is
very
little
in
boddie
when
it's
out
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
supports
petitioner’s
contention
--
petitioner
of
bankruptcy's
contention
here.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it's
a
diminishing
factor,
i
think
when
read
in
context,
when
you
look
at
the
next
sentence
that
follows
that.
the
kind
of
harassment
he
was
talking
about
was
in
fact
that
metropolitan
life
insurance
company,
whenever
he
gives
that
company
as
a
reference,
seek
employment,
says
to
the
prospective
employer
that
this
fellow
was
a
thief.
now,
how
a
discharge
of
bankruptcy
is
going
to
help
him,
i
don't
know,
but
if
you
look
at
page
13
of
the
brief,
what
he
says
is,
that
since
metropolitan
--
now,
if
he
gets
the
discharge
says
he,
it's
true
that
metropolitan
would
still
continue
to
tell
prospective
employers
that
he
is
a
thief,
but
says
he,
since
metropolitan
did
not
appear
before
the
referee
to
contest
the
debt,
appellee’s
discharge
in
bankruptcy
will
not
only
erase
this
debt,
but
will
hopefully
remove
the
unwarranted
stigma
that
operates
as
an
albatross
around
his
neck,
because
he
says
metropolitan
will
have
to
explain
why
it
is
they
didn't
appear
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
contest
the
discharge.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
until
he
anticipates
getting
it.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
as
soon
as
he
gets
a
job
or
he
is
offered
a
job,
he
can
come
in
and
file
his
bankruptcy
petition
and
that
will
in
effect
immunize
his
earnings
after
the
petition
is
filed.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
assume
that
--
i
am
thinking
about
as
a
practical
matter,
if
an
employer
was
offering
him
a
job
and
said,
well,
you
have
this
thousand
dollar
judgment
against
you,
i
am
not
going
to
hire
you.
he
can
say,
well,
if
that's
the
only
impediment,
i
will
file
a
bankruptcy
petition
tomorrow
and
that
will
resolve
the
problem.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
was
listed
as
a
debt
that
he
wanted
to
have
discharged,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
don't
know
justice
powell
that
new
york
allows
such
course
of
action.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
and
i
am
not
familiar
enough,
quite
frankly,
with
whether
under
the
bankruptcy
law
such
a
contingency
would
be
considered
an
asset.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
there
is
what
we
call
is
--
there
is
a
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute.
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
exception
to
that
statute,
which
is
based
on
a
congressional
finding
that
there
is
simply
another
and
a
better
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
in
forma
pauperis
applicants
in
bankruptcy
proceedings,
and
that
better
way
is
simply
you
have
the
asset-less
debtor
file
his
petition
and
pay
it
out
in
installments,
that
filing
of
the
petition
is
based
and
a
need
for
the
discharge
is
based
on
his
assumed
expectations
of
earnings,
and
for
these
reasons
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reversed.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
the
district
court
--
i
am
sorry,
the
district
court
said
that
the
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
you
can't
get
the
discharge
in
bankruptcy
until
you
pay
the
fee
in
each
challenge.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
when
he
filed
--
right,
and
he
said
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
either
prepayment
or
a
statement
of
indigency
with
a
proposed
plan
to
pay
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it
would
have
demanded
prepayment
or
a
statement
of
how
he
proposed
to
pay
in
installments,
and
he
said
that
he
could
make
no
promise
to
pay
in
installments.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
and
you
get
all
the
advantages
of
the
adjudication.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
the
reason
i
hadn't
mr.
justice
stewart
is
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
holding
of
the
district
court
is
contested.
the
legislative
history
is
rather
clear
on
the
issue.
it
clearly
indicates
the
intent
of
congress
to
abolish
in
forma
pauperis
proceedings
of
bankruptcy.
every
court
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
1946
i
believe.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don't
know.
i
know
that
there
was
a
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
in
effect
in
1898
when
congress
initially
provided
for
in
forma
pauperis
treatment
of
bankruptcy,
and
i
think
probably
the
fact
that
congress
felt
that
it
needed
a
special
statute
for
the
bankruptcy
act,
initially,
would
indicate
that
the
congress
was
not
of
the
view
that
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
applied
to
bankruptcy
proceedings.
but
as
a
general
matter,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
legislative
history
and
every
court
mr.
justice
stewart,
even
the
courts
that
have
struck
the
statute
down,
has
held
that
the
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
has
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
i
will
have
to
agree
that
the
plain
language
does
seem
to
cover
it,
if
you
don't
consider
the
particular
legislative
history
involved
here.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
but
there
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
but
the
language
of
the
statute
clearly
indicates
that
congress
did
not
want
the
discharge
to
be
granted
till
the
filing
fees
were
paid
in
the
the
legislative
history.
and
the
rules
of
this
court,
i
would
add,
the
orders
of
bankruptcy
which
were
based
on
the
statute
so
read
it.
it
said,
no
discharge
until
the
filing
fees
are
paid
and
the
legislative
history
clearly
assumes
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
assumes
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
the
rules
did
not
assume
an
ability
to
pay
initially,
that
is
on
the
show
that
you
are
a
pauper
in
order
to
get
this
benefit
of
installment
payments,
and
i
think
congress
clearly
--
it
would
be
somewhat
silly
for
congress
to
say
you
have
to
show
you
are
a
pauper
before
you
could
get
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it
wouldn't,
but
it
would
in
any
event
seem
somewhat
silly
for
congress
to
say
that
you
have
to
file
a
--
you
have
to
make
a
statement
of
indigency
before
you
can
get
benefit
of
an
installment
payment,
and
then
on
the
other
hand
contemplate
that
a
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
would
apply,
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
anything
except
file
the
petition
and
the
affidavit
of
indigency.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it
has
been
applied
broadly
except
in
this
area
where
the
--
all
of
the
lower
courts,
almost
--
i
don't
know
the
decision
the
other
way,
have
held
that
the
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute
is
inapplicable
here.
