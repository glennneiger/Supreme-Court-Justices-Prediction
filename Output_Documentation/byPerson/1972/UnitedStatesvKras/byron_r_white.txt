justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
just
a
question
then
of
when
the
discharge
occurs,
before
or
after
the
payment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
sooner
or
later
he
is
going
to
have
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
string
out
the
time
for
paying
the
installments
and
keep
the
injunction
in
force
you
really
in
effect
have
a
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
you
can
collect
the
fees
sometime,
or
if
you
can
extend
the
time
and
in
effect
get
a
discharge,
you
will
give
him
two
years
at
$00.10
a
week
before
he
gets
the
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
issue
here
whether
the
district
court
could
require
a
prepayment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
in
the
argument
that
(inaudible)
was
there
a
demand
that
he
prepaid
the
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
thought
the
question
was
how
could
simply
when
he
file
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
had
--
does
the
practice
in
the
district
court
require
prepayment
to
take
the
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
filed
the
petition
saying
he
was
an
indigent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
district
court
demand
--
would
have
demanded
that,
except
for
its
owing
one
constitutionality
would
have
demanded
prepayment,
wouldn't
have
taken
the
petition
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
actual
rule
is,
you
may
file
and
if
you
propose
installments,
you
may
file
and
the
process
will
go
forward
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
attack
the
district
judge's
indication
that
the
fee
may
be
collected
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
comes
out
of
bankruptcy
with
this
debt?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
a
discharge
covers
his
debt?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn’t
cover
this
debt?
justice
byron
r.
white
