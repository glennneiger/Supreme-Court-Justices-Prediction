mr.
fred
w.
phifer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
possibly
to
give
a
little
bit
more
background
on
this
case,
the
question
that
was
raised
about
tenancyat
sufferance
was
raised
in
the
wyoming
supreme
court
and
was
specifically
not
passed
on.
there
is
no
written
lease
in
this
case
as
the
interrogatory
shows.
this
was
a
working
arrangement
between
two
corporations
to
use
the
land.
now
what
isn't
shown
in
the
record
but
i
am
sure
mr.
burgess
would
concede
is
that
one
man
is
the
primary
stockholder
in
these
two
corporations.
they
both
belong
to
a
man
by
the
name
of
elvin
johnston.
he
has
several
ranches,
as
indicated
by
the
record,
johnston
fuel
liners
is
a
trucking
company.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
the
boards
are
the
same,
yes,
there
is
some
differentiation
in
some
of
the
minority
stockholders
but
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
the
stockholdings
are
not
quite
the
same
but
almost
the
same
mr.
justice.
secondly,
in
wyoming
there
is
a
statute
which
specifically
provides
that
you
are
a
tenant
at
sufferance
unless
you
have
a
specific
written
lease.
so
in
this
case,
there
are
a
candidate
sufferance
although
the
wyoming
supreme
court
passed
over
that
question
when
i
raised
it
in
my
brief.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
question
on
paying
for
this,
the
district
is
originally
formed
as
an
(inaudible)
would
indicate
on
a
watershed
area,
the
drainage
is
all
the
same.
then
after
the
district
is
formed
and
after
they
have
decided
that
it
is
feasible
to
build
a
dam
in
a
certain
location,
then
only
the
lands
that
are
benefited
below
that
dam
are
assessed.
in
other
words,
not
all
of
the
lands
that
is
in
the
watershed
district,
much
of
it
is
in
the
mountainous
area,
this
area
in
particular
is
an
outlying
area,
the
lowest
elevation
i
suppose
in
the
district
would
be
6900
feet
running
from
there
to
about
7200
feet.
it's
quite
an
arid
area.
the
dam
in
on
the
north
wyoming
river
which
is
a
very
small
river
but
normally
in
the
middle
of
the
summer,
you
could
step
across
it
in
places.
there
is
a
large
spring
run
off
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
type
of
law
in
wyoming
to
catch
this
spring
run
off,
so
that
it
can
be
used
later
for
irrigation.
the
meadows
that
are
irrigated
here
will
only
grow
in
hay
because
of
the
altitude
and
the
shortness
of
the
growing
season.
there
probably
is
2000
acres
involved
belonging
to
about
12
different
families.
the
production
on
these
wells
is
very
limited
again
because
of
the
fragility
of
the
soil,
it's
a
very
thin
outlying
soil
mostly
gravel.
it
will
produce
a
half-a-ton
to
a
ton
of
hay,
with
very
good
cultivation
and
some
fertilizer.
it
might
produce
a
ton-and-a
half
a
hay,
but
here
again
it's
not
alfalfa,
as
mr.
justice
quite
would
be
familiar
with
from
his
background
in
northern
colorado
but
primarily
wild
hay.
it
has
no
market
this
area
is
located
about
60
miles
from
the
nearest
town.
the
hay
is
used
primarily
by
the
ranchers
for
cattle.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
the
wyoming
peak
is
right
on
the
edge
of
this,
so
it's
in
the
vicinity
of
laramie,
wyoming
it
would
be
about
60
to
70
miles
in
north
of
laramie
wyoming.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
no
it's
irrigated
meadows.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
you
harvested
hay,
you
have
to
have
it
for
winter.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
all
that
most
part
they
don't
bale
it
here,
primarily
because
the
meadows
are
too
rough.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
keep
the
cattle
there
and
feed
them
there
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
in
the
winter
time.
this
would
provide
only
supplemental
water
incidentally
to
existing
water
rights.
it
would
not
bring
any
new
land
under
irrigation.
here
again
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
who
pays
for
this,
once
this
question
here
is
decided,
if
we
are
still
constitutional,
then
appraisers
are
ordered
by
the
court
to
go
out
and
appraise
the
land
that
will
be
benefited,
only
the
land
that
will
be
under
ditch.
now
the
land
will
be
classified,
by
these
appraisers
so
that
some
of
it
will
probably
pay
a
little
bit
more
than
others.
but
where
the
total
area
of
the
watershed
district
itself
might
be
15,000
or
20,000
acres.
the
area
that
will
pay
for
it
is
only
the
area
that's
benefited
that
would
come
under,
i
would
say
under
2000
acres
meadow.
now,
in
regard
to
the
question
on
priority
of
water
rights
in
wyoming,
domestic
consumption
does
come
first,
and
it
can
at
any
time
condemn
any
other
industrial
or
agricultural
water,
if
it's
necessary.
in
this
case
it's
very
unlikely,
it's
located
in
a
remote
area.
there
is
under
the
provisions
for
setting
up
the
watershed
law
in
the
first
place,
congress
enacted
specific
legislation
making
grants
in
aid
to
watershed
districts
to
build
these
sort
of
things.
in
the
interest
of
conservation
and
particularly
in
the
interest
of
flood
control,
and
we
have
a
flood
control
problem
here.
nothing
that
menaces
life
but
that
does
cause
damage,
quite
extensive
damage
down
the
river
each
year.
they
grant
about
50%
of
the
cost
of
these
projects
as
an
outright
rent.
then
the
other
half
of
it
is
loaned
to
the
projects
by
the
farmers
home
administration.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
the
case
got
started
primarily
right
after
the
district
was
formed,
we
asked
permission
to
go
on
to
johnston's
land
to
make
a
survey
to
see
if
the
foundation
studies
would
be
proper
to
build
a
dam
in
a
particular
location.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
he
allowed
us
to
go
on
first.
well,
he
have
already
guessed
the
formation
the
district
yes,
then
he
allowed
us
to
go
in
his
land
and
check
to
see,
then
as
it
often
happens
with
government
projects,
we
had
the
inadequate
data.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yes.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
actually
the
vote
--
there
were
only
three
land
owners
that
voted
against
that
there
were
about
12
that
voted
for
it.
there
were
two
large
land
owners
in
the
area
and
both
of
them
voted
for
it.
so
the
acreage
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
he
got
out
voted.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
as
to
the
land
owners.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
think
that
based
on
the
decisions
in
this
court,
all
of
which
are
concerned
with
so
called
popular
elections.
i
am
not
exactly
sure
what
a
popular
elections
except
that
it's
where
we
go
into
a
voting
booth
and
it's
a
secret
ballot
and
whether
we
are
voting
on
sewage
bonds
or
anything
else,
it
has
a
particular
form
to
it.
this
and
the
decision
of
this
court
apply
to
popular
elections,
unless
there
is
an
--
they
will
stand
unless
there
is
invidious
discrimination.
in
fact,
i
think
there
is
some
language
in
some
cases
of
this
court,
that
says
once
the
popular
election
process
shows
then
you
must
do
so
and
so.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
it
would
still
have
passed.
both
ways,
but
here
is
the
thing
this
is
not
popular
election.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
if
we
lose
this
suit,
the
entire
wyoming
watershed
law
i
think
is
unconstitutional,
then
probably
we
have
plans
to
go
back
and
form
a
private
ditch
company--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
they
wouldn't,
in
one
particular
instance,
if
lessees
are
allowed
to
vote,
then
what
is
to
prevent
the
landowner
who
is
against
this,
from
leasing,
ten
acres
out
of
10,000
acres
to
50
different
people
in
a
line
to
vote.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yeah.
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
these
are
things
that
open
to
fraud.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
but
we
know
how
the
new
vote
will
come
out
because
we
not
only
have
a
majority
in
number,
we
have
a
majority
in
acreage
both,
either
way
we
are
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that's
right,
and
they
will
control
the
election.
it
leaves
it
open
to
fraud
i
think.
i
think
that
this
is
the
compelling
state
interest
that,
the
state
of
wyoming
had
in
setting
up
this
proposition
of
landowners
only,
is
that
it
does
leave
it
open
to
fraud.
if
you
do
it
on
the
basis
of
letting
lessees
also.
not
only
that
but
let's
take
this
particular
instance.
here
is
johnston
fuel
liners
and
associated
enterprises,
are
you
going
to
say
that
only
lessees
can
vote
and
the
landowner
can't
if
there
is
a
lease
or
you
are
going
to
say
both
lessees
and
landlords
can
vote.
if
that's
the
case
mr.
johnson
would
be
allowed
to
vote
twice
in
this
instance.
because
he
owns
the
land
as
one
corporation
he
is
a
lessee
as
another.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
he
was
his
own
lessor
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
now
going
back
to
this
popular
election
proposition,
this
is
not
a
popular
election,
there
is
no
secret
ballot
to
start
with.
because
they
have
to
write
down
how
many
acres
they
have
so
that
we'll
know
when
we
look
at
their
name
at
the
counting
of
the
ballots
how
many
acres
are
involved.
there
is
no
age
limit
in
this
case.
there
is
no
residency
requirement,
in
fact
there
isn't
any
citizenship
requirement
nor
is
a
vote
limited
to
persons.
a
swiss
corporation
if
it
filed
to
do
business
in
wyoming
could
own
land
and
vote
in
this.
so
it
has
no
real
comparison
to
a
popular
election,
which
to
my
mind
distinguishes
this
from
the
whole
line
of
cases
on
one
man
one
vote.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that's
the
right
because
actually
as
you
said
in
previous
cases
the
renter
or
the
lessee
ends
up
paying
bill
and
increased
rent
at
least
to
next
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
do
accept
that,
except
that
i
am
afraid
that
the
compelling
state
interest
in
this
case
is
to
exclude
lessees
because
it
would
lead
the
elections
open
to
fraud
and
that
any
landowner
that
was
opposed
to
it
could
bring
an
enough
so
called
lessees
to
entirely
control
the
elections.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
no,
i
read
cipriano
and
all
the
other
cases
once
you
get
out
of
the
--
once
you
get
into
the
bond
election
sort
of
process.
everything
at
this
court
had
passed
on
before,
with
regard
to
school
district,
sewer
bonds
and
so
forth,
the
benefit
in
those
cases
were
things,
were
such
that
benefited
the
entire
community,
everybody
in
a
sewer
district
is
interested
in
sewers,
whether
they
own
land
and
have
to
pay
for
the
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
regardless
of
who
pays
the
bill,
everybody
is
directly
affected
by
sewage
disposal.
it's
a
matter
of
again
health
of
the
whole
community.
so
that
and
like
schools
whether
you
have
children
in
school
or
whether
you
own
property,
everyone
in
the
community
is
directly
affected
and
directly
interested
in
the
benefits
of
the
schools.
everyone
in
the
community
is
not
directly
interested
or
directly
benefited
by
a
watershed
district.
this
is
only
concerned
with
irrigation
water.
now
i
can't
differentiate
too
much
between
lessees
and
landlords.
but
you
can
certainly
differentiate
between
people
who
or
several
residents,
for
instance,
that
would
cabin
side
in
the
watershed
district
or
employees
on
ranches,
another
way
of
broodingly
controlling
this
election
would
be
to
bring
up
multitude
of
employees
in,
just
prior
to
election
and
allowing
them
to
vote
because
they
are
located
on
the
ranches.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
you
do
mr.
justice
up
to
the
point
that
they
have
to
support
them
for
about
30
days
i
believe
now
under
your
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
a
residency
equirement
in
here?
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
i
think
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
make
a
residency
requirement
here
because
here
we
go
back
to
the
matter
of
discrimination,
is
the
class
which
is
excluded
more
directly
interested
in
the
results
than
the
class
which
is
included.
and
in
this
case
if
you
put
a
residency
requirement
in,
all
the
corporations
at
a
glance
would
be
non-residents.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no
but
the
only
alternative
i
think
to
the
present
system
where
it
limits
the
landowners,
is
a
system
that
what
put
it
back
on
the
old
residency
requirement.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
lessor?
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
in
our
areas
yes
sir
they
all
pay
the
taxes
directly
themselves
generally
speaking
at
least
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
of
course
ultimately
then
it
goes
back
to
who
is
paying
the
bill.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
probably
12
families.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
not
a
thing
except
that
they
are
not
the
people
who
are
directly
interested
in
the
elections.
the
landowners
are
--
there
are
quite
a
few
landowners
that
live
in
this
area.
for
instances
neither
one
of
the
corporations
here
actually
headquarter
here.
they
wouldn't
be
classed
as
residents.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
the
other
cases
are
at
the
benefit,
i
think
sewer
or
bonds
or
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no
sir,
no
sir,
it's
only
of
interest
to
the
people
who
own
or
lease
irrigated
land.
it's
not
of
any
interest
to
summer
people,
except
for
the
low
possibility
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that
would
make
a
great
deal
of
interest,
because
even
if
you
are
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
i
think
that
if
you
limited
it
again,
as
i
said
to
residence,
then
you
will
be
excluding
a
great
number
of
land
owners
who
are
directly
interested
in
this.
and
i
think
then
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
if
lessees
were
allowed
to
vote
and
if
associated
or
johnston
fuel
liners
is
classified
as
lessee
which
has
no
lease.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
bona
fide
lessees
again,
you
can
make
out
50
leases
in
an
afternoon.
i
think
that
the
lessee's
interest
is
not
different
than
the
land
owners.
i
think
they
both
have
a
commonality
of
purpose
in
irrigation
districts.
so
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
voting
at
odds.
i
think
also,
that
it's
not
fair
for
a
lessee,
who
may
be
tenant
at
sufferance
or
at
least
for
a
term
of
years
to
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
push
through
a
large
expensive
project
--
the
payoff
on
this
is
estimated
as
50
years.
and
he
may
be
there
a
year
of
two
and
pull
out
and
leave
the
landlord
with
$3
½
or
$4
a
year
assessment
to
pay
on
this
project.
i
agree
that
it
doesn't
seem
on
itself
on
the
surface
to
be
fair,
except
that
you
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
and
i
think
it
is
more
fair
to
draw
the
line
against
the
lessees
that
it
would
be
to
set
up
a
residency
requirement
and
draw
the
line
against
--
but
non-resident
landowners
who
have
a
very
direct
interest
in
both
the
benefits
and
the
cost
of
this
project.
secondly,
i
really
believe
that
this
isn't
again
a
matter
of
government
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
they
wouldn't,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
am
differentiating
here
again,
mr.
justice,
between
--
if
the
lessee
is
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
here
again
the
lessees
would
not
have
to
come
up
here.
if
lessees
were
allowed
to
vote
without
a
residency
requirement.
if
there
is
a
residency
requirement,
i
am
not
worried
about
fraud,
because
i
don't
think
they
are
going
to
move
lessees
into
the
area
and
make
them
stay
there
almost
till
they
fill
up
the
lessee,
let's
say
a
fractional
residency
requirement.
it's
a
pretty
remote
and
cold
area.
but
i
do
think
that
then,
you
are
probably
excluding
a
great
many
people
who
are
directly
interested
in
the
thing,
and
there
are
non-residents,
or
even
non-citizens,
non-persons
as
these
corporations,
who
should
be
allowed
to
vote
at.
i
don't
think
you
could
device
a
fair
system.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
injustice
here.
no
large
landowner
can
force
through
a
vote,
on
his
small
neighbors
because
it
has
to
be
pass
by
a
majority
of
the
people.
conversely,
no
group
of
small
landowners
could
come
in
and
force
a
project
against
one
large
landowner
who
would
have
the
burden
of
pain
for
it.
because
it
must
pass
by
a
majority
of
the
acreage.
and
limiting
it
to
landowners
here
again
is
the
only
logical
way
that
it
can
be
done,
i
think.
here
again,
i
think
it
should
be
differentiated
from
a
governmental
unit.
it
is
a
governmental
entity,
but
it
exercises
no
sovereign
power
over
the
people.
none
of
the
---
it's
more
in
the
nature
of
a
quasi-private
corporation
or
quasi-public.
it
has
a
power
to
levy
and
collect
assessments,
which
almost
any
mutual
company
would
have.
it
has
the
power
to
buy
and
sell
real
estate
and
personal
property
and
the
power
to
borrow
money
and
sell
bonds
which
any
private
corporation
can
do.
it
does
have
the
power
to
receive
government
grants
and
loans,
that
i
think,
the
(inaudible)
corporation
has
that
power
also.
and
it
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
now
there
seems
to
be
in
counsel's
brief,
a
great
distinction
made
because
of
this
branding
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
every
private
or
public
utility
has
the
power
to
eminent
domain.
so
i
think
this
thing
has
much
more
in
common
with
private
corporations
than
it
does
with
any
public
governmental
entity.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no,
we
have
a
meeting,
and
they
come
in
and
vote.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
individual
representatives
of
the
corporation.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yes,
in
this
instance,
this
is
a
small
community
and
there
is
no
question
about
who
is
the
owner
of
the
corporation
and
also
the
land.
in
the
course
only
one
man
would
be
allowed.
here
again
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yes,
it
is
an
open
meeting
and
there
is
quite
an
involved
due
notice
requirement
here.
every
time
anything
is
done
by
this
thing,
by
the
watershed
district,
due
notice
must
be
given
in
and
it
must
be
posted
at
four
or
five
places
prominent
in
the
district
which
is
kind
of
hard
to
do,
when
there
ranches
are
ten
miles
are
apart,
they
post
them
on
the
bridge
post
and
it
has
to
be
advertised
in
the
newspaper
in
the
area
for
three
weeks
i
think,
prior
to
that
time.
so
there
is
good
notice
given,
not
only
that
but
because
we
anticipated
that
there
will
be
problems
in
the
first
place,
we
always
send
certified
letters
to
everyone
of
the
voters,
giving
them
due
notice
of
any
elections.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
they
only
have
one
market
and
that's
united
states
government,
the
bonds
as
such
are
merely
security
for
the
obligation
under
the
fha
rules.
it'd
be
interesting
to
see
how
they
were
foreclosed
on
those
bonds,
if
they
had
to
since
almost
all
of
the
land
involved
was
privately
mortgaged
to
insurance
companies
or
to
the
state
of
wyoming,
prior
to
this
time.
so
the
bonds
are
an
overriding
obligation
on
the
watershed
district,
and
they
had
quite
a
time
collecting
on
them
if
they
were
to
pay.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
they
are
really
not
a
private
debt,
there
are
debt
of
the
watershed
district
itself,
and
the
land
under
assessment
is
of
course
subject
to
leans
or
assessments,
but
--
and
it
might
be
subject
to
foreclosure
by
these,
but
i
think
the
government
would
have
step
in
pay
off,
lot
of
insurance
company
loans
before
they
can
do
it.
it
isn't
spelled
up
very
well.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no,
the
statute
does
not
say
something.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no,
it
hasn't
been
adjudicated.
i
don't
know
whether
they're
subordinate
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
don't
--
i
am
sorry,
i
think
you
are
right,
it
wouldn't
be
subordinate
but
the
assessments
are
not
subordinate.
but
the
assessments
don't
represent
the
bonds.
the
assessments
are
merely
--
assessments
made
by
the
districts
to
help
pay
the
bills
of
the
districts,
and
it
could
not
only
be
bonds
but
improvements
and
everything
else.
and
the
assessments
are
an
obligation
owing
to
the
district
from
that
landowner.
there
is
no
other
obligation,
from
the
district
to
the
federal
government
for
the
loan
except
the
bonds,
and
what
their
priority
is,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that's
right.
here
again
i
don't
know
what
the
priority
is,
that
would
be
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that
might
be.
thank
you
gentleman.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
possibly
to
give
a
little
bit
more
background
on
this
case,
the
question
that
was
raised
about
tenancyat
sufferance
was
raised
in
the
wyoming
supreme
court
and
was
specifically
not
passed
on.
there
is
no
written
lease
in
this
case
as
the
interrogatory
shows.
this
was
a
working
arrangement
between
two
corporations
to
use
the
land.
now
what
isn't
shown
in
the
record
but
i
am
sure
mr.
burgess
would
concede
is
that
one
man
is
the
primary
stockholder
in
these
two
corporations.
they
both
belong
to
a
man
by
the
name
of
elvin
johnston.
he
has
several
ranches,
as
indicated
by
the
record,
johnston
fuel
liners
is
a
trucking
company.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
the
boards
are
the
same,
yes,
there
is
some
differentiation
in
some
of
the
minority
stockholders
but
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
the
stockholdings
are
not
quite
the
same
but
almost
the
same
mr.
justice.
secondly,
in
wyoming
there
is
a
statute
which
specifically
provides
that
you
are
a
tenant
at
sufferance
unless
you
have
a
specific
written
lease.
so
in
this
case,
there
are
a
candidate
sufferance
although
the
wyoming
supreme
court
passed
over
that
question
when
i
raised
it
in
my
brief.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
question
on
paying
for
this,
the
district
is
originally
formed
as
an
(inaudible)
would
indicate
on
a
watershed
area,
the
drainage
is
all
the
same.
then
after
the
district
is
formed
and
after
they
have
decided
that
it
is
feasible
to
build
a
dam
in
a
certain
location,
then
only
the
lands
that
are
benefited
below
that
dam
are
assessed.
in
other
words,
not
all
of
the
lands
that
is
in
the
watershed
district,
much
of
it
is
in
the
mountainous
area,
this
area
in
particular
is
an
outlying
area,
the
lowest
elevation
i
suppose
in
the
district
would
be
6900
feet
running
from
there
to
about
7200
feet.
it's
quite
an
arid
area.
the
dam
in
on
the
north
wyoming
river
which
is
a
very
small
river
but
normally
in
the
middle
of
the
summer,
you
could
step
across
it
in
places.
there
is
a
large
spring
run
off
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
type
of
law
in
wyoming
to
catch
this
spring
run
off,
so
that
it
can
be
used
later
for
irrigation.
the
meadows
that
are
irrigated
here
will
only
grow
in
hay
because
of
the
altitude
and
the
shortness
of
the
growing
season.
there
probably
is
2000
acres
involved
belonging
to
about
12
different
families.
the
production
on
these
wells
is
very
limited
again
because
of
the
fragility
of
the
soil,
it's
a
very
thin
outlying
soil
mostly
gravel.
it
will
produce
a
half-a-ton
to
a
ton
of
hay,
with
very
good
cultivation
and
some
fertilizer.
it
might
produce
a
ton-and-a
half
a
hay,
but
here
again
it's
not
alfalfa,
as
mr.
justice
quite
would
be
familiar
with
from
his
background
in
northern
colorado
but
primarily
wild
hay.
it
has
no
market
this
area
is
located
about
60
miles
from
the
nearest
town.
the
hay
is
used
primarily
by
the
ranchers
for
cattle.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
the
wyoming
peak
is
right
on
the
edge
of
this,
so
it's
in
the
vicinity
of
laramie,
wyoming
it
would
be
about
60
to
70
miles
in
north
of
laramie
wyoming.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
no
it's
irrigated
meadows.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
you
harvested
hay,
you
have
to
have
it
for
winter.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
all
that
most
part
they
don't
bale
it
here,
primarily
because
the
meadows
are
too
rough.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
keep
the
cattle
there
and
feed
them
there
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
in
the
winter
time.
this
would
provide
only
supplemental
water
incidentally
to
existing
water
rights.
it
would
not
bring
any
new
land
under
irrigation.
here
again
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
who
pays
for
this,
once
this
question
here
is
decided,
if
we
are
still
constitutional,
then
appraisers
are
ordered
by
the
court
to
go
out
and
appraise
the
land
that
will
be
benefited,
only
the
land
that
will
be
under
ditch.
now
the
land
will
be
classified,
by
these
appraisers
so
that
some
of
it
will
probably
pay
a
little
bit
more
than
others.
but
where
the
total
area
of
the
watershed
district
itself
might
be
15,000
or
20,000
acres.
the
area
that
will
pay
for
it
is
only
the
area
that's
benefited
that
would
come
under,
i
would
say
under
2000
acres
meadow.
now,
in
regard
to
the
question
on
priority
of
water
rights
in
wyoming,
domestic
consumption
does
come
first,
and
it
can
at
any
time
condemn
any
other
industrial
or
agricultural
water,
if
it's
necessary.
in
this
case
it's
very
unlikely,
it's
located
in
a
remote
area.
there
is
under
the
provisions
for
setting
up
the
watershed
law
in
the
first
place,
congress
enacted
specific
legislation
making
grants
in
aid
to
watershed
districts
to
build
these
sort
of
things.
in
the
interest
of
conservation
and
particularly
in
the
interest
of
flood
control,
and
we
have
a
flood
control
problem
here.
nothing
that
menaces
life
but
that
does
cause
damage,
quite
extensive
damage
down
the
river
each
year.
they
grant
about
50%
of
the
cost
of
these
projects
as
an
outright
rent.
then
the
other
half
of
it
is
loaned
to
the
projects
by
the
farmers
home
administration.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
the
case
got
started
primarily
right
after
the
district
was
formed,
we
asked
permission
to
go
on
to
johnston's
land
to
make
a
survey
to
see
if
the
foundation
studies
would
be
proper
to
build
a
dam
in
a
particular
location.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
he
allowed
us
to
go
on
first.
well,
he
have
already
guessed
the
formation
the
district
yes,
then
he
allowed
us
to
go
in
his
land
and
check
to
see,
then
as
it
often
happens
with
government
projects,
we
had
the
inadequate
data.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yes.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
actually
the
vote
--
there
were
only
three
land
owners
that
voted
against
that
there
were
about
12
that
voted
for
it.
there
were
two
large
land
owners
in
the
area
and
both
of
them
voted
for
it.
so
the
acreage
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
he
got
out
voted.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
as
to
the
land
owners.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
think
that
based
on
the
decisions
in
this
court,
all
of
which
are
concerned
with
so
called
popular
elections.
i
am
not
exactly
sure
what
a
popular
elections
except
that
it's
where
we
go
into
a
voting
booth
and
it's
a
secret
ballot
and
whether
we
are
voting
on
sewage
bonds
or
anything
else,
it
has
a
particular
form
to
it.
this
and
the
decision
of
this
court
apply
to
popular
elections,
unless
there
is
an
--
they
will
stand
unless
there
is
invidious
discrimination.
in
fact,
i
think
there
is
some
language
in
some
cases
of
this
court,
that
says
once
the
popular
election
process
shows
then
you
must
do
so
and
so.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
it
would
still
have
passed.
both
ways,
but
here
is
the
thing
this
is
not
popular
election.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
if
we
lose
this
suit,
the
entire
wyoming
watershed
law
i
think
is
unconstitutional,
then
probably
we
have
plans
to
go
back
and
form
a
private
ditch
company--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
they
wouldn't,
in
one
particular
instance,
if
lessees
are
allowed
to
vote,
then
what
is
to
prevent
the
landowner
who
is
against
this,
from
leasing,
ten
acres
out
of
10,000
acres
to
50
different
people
in
a
line
to
vote.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yeah.
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
these
are
things
that
open
to
fraud.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
but
we
know
how
the
new
vote
will
come
out
because
we
not
only
have
a
majority
in
number,
we
have
a
majority
in
acreage
both,
either
way
we
are
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that's
right,
and
they
will
control
the
election.
it
leaves
it
open
to
fraud
i
think.
i
think
that
this
is
the
compelling
state
interest
that,
the
state
of
wyoming
had
in
setting
up
this
proposition
of
landowners
only,
is
that
it
does
leave
it
open
to
fraud.
if
you
do
it
on
the
basis
of
letting
lessees
also.
not
only
that
but
let's
take
this
particular
instance.
here
is
johnston
fuel
liners
and
associated
enterprises,
are
you
going
to
say
that
only
lessees
can
vote
and
the
landowner
can't
if
there
is
a
lease
or
you
are
going
to
say
both
lessees
and
landlords
can
vote.
if
that's
the
case
mr.
johnson
would
be
allowed
to
vote
twice
in
this
instance.
because
he
owns
the
land
as
one
corporation
he
is
a
lessee
as
another.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
he
was
his
own
lessor
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
now
going
back
to
this
popular
election
proposition,
this
is
not
a
popular
election,
there
is
no
secret
ballot
to
start
with.
because
they
have
to
write
down
how
many
acres
they
have
so
that
we'll
know
when
we
look
at
their
name
at
the
counting
of
the
ballots
how
many
acres
are
involved.
there
is
no
age
limit
in
this
case.
there
is
no
residency
requirement,
in
fact
there
isn't
any
citizenship
requirement
nor
is
a
vote
limited
to
persons.
a
swiss
corporation
if
it
filed
to
do
business
in
wyoming
could
own
land
and
vote
in
this.
so
it
has
no
real
comparison
to
a
popular
election,
which
to
my
mind
distinguishes
this
from
the
whole
line
of
cases
on
one
man
one
vote.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that's
the
right
because
actually
as
you
said
in
previous
cases
the
renter
or
the
lessee
ends
up
paying
bill
and
increased
rent
at
least
to
next
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
do
accept
that,
except
that
i
am
afraid
that
the
compelling
state
interest
in
this
case
is
to
exclude
lessees
because
it
would
lead
the
elections
open
to
fraud
and
that
any
landowner
that
was
opposed
to
it
could
bring
an
enough
so
called
lessees
to
entirely
control
the
elections.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
no,
i
read
cipriano
and
all
the
other
cases
once
you
get
out
of
the
--
once
you
get
into
the
bond
election
sort
of
process.
everything
at
this
court
had
passed
on
before,
with
regard
to
school
district,
sewer
bonds
and
so
forth,
the
benefit
in
those
cases
were
things,
were
such
that
benefited
the
entire
community,
everybody
in
a
sewer
district
is
interested
in
sewers,
whether
they
own
land
and
have
to
pay
for
the
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
regardless
of
who
pays
the
bill,
everybody
is
directly
affected
by
sewage
disposal.
it's
a
matter
of
again
health
of
the
whole
community.
so
that
and
like
schools
whether
you
have
children
in
school
or
whether
you
own
property,
everyone
in
the
community
is
directly
affected
and
directly
interested
in
the
benefits
of
the
schools.
everyone
in
the
community
is
not
directly
interested
or
directly
benefited
by
a
watershed
district.
this
is
only
concerned
with
irrigation
water.
now
i
can't
differentiate
too
much
between
lessees
and
landlords.
but
you
can
certainly
differentiate
between
people
who
or
several
residents,
for
instance,
that
would
cabin
side
in
the
watershed
district
or
employees
on
ranches,
another
way
of
broodingly
controlling
this
election
would
be
to
bring
up
multitude
of
employees
in,
just
prior
to
election
and
allowing
them
to
vote
because
they
are
located
on
the
ranches.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
you
do
mr.
justice
up
to
the
point
that
they
have
to
support
them
for
about
30
days
i
believe
now
under
your
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
a
residency
equirement
in
here?
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well
i
think
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
make
a
residency
requirement
here
because
here
we
go
back
to
the
matter
of
discrimination,
is
the
class
which
is
excluded
more
directly
interested
in
the
results
than
the
class
which
is
included.
and
in
this
case
if
you
put
a
residency
requirement
in,
all
the
corporations
at
a
glance
would
be
non-residents.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no
but
the
only
alternative
i
think
to
the
present
system
where
it
limits
the
landowners,
is
a
system
that
what
put
it
back
on
the
old
residency
requirement.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
lessor?
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
in
our
areas
yes
sir
they
all
pay
the
taxes
directly
themselves
generally
speaking
at
least
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
of
course
ultimately
then
it
goes
back
to
who
is
paying
the
bill.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
probably
12
families.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
not
a
thing
except
that
they
are
not
the
people
who
are
directly
interested
in
the
elections.
the
landowners
are
--
there
are
quite
a
few
landowners
that
live
in
this
area.
for
instances
neither
one
of
the
corporations
here
actually
headquarter
here.
they
wouldn't
be
classed
as
residents.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
the
other
cases
are
at
the
benefit,
i
think
sewer
or
bonds
or
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no
sir,
no
sir,
it's
only
of
interest
to
the
people
who
own
or
lease
irrigated
land.
it's
not
of
any
interest
to
summer
people,
except
for
the
low
possibility
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that
would
make
a
great
deal
of
interest,
because
even
if
you
are
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
i
think
that
if
you
limited
it
again,
as
i
said
to
residence,
then
you
will
be
excluding
a
great
number
of
land
owners
who
are
directly
interested
in
this.
and
i
think
then
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
if
lessees
were
allowed
to
vote
and
if
associated
or
johnston
fuel
liners
is
classified
as
lessee
which
has
no
lease.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
bona
fide
lessees
again,
you
can
make
out
50
leases
in
an
afternoon.
i
think
that
the
lessee's
interest
is
not
different
than
the
land
owners.
i
think
they
both
have
a
commonality
of
purpose
in
irrigation
districts.
so
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
voting
at
odds.
i
think
also,
that
it's
not
fair
for
a
lessee,
who
may
be
tenant
at
sufferance
or
at
least
for
a
term
of
years
to
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
push
through
a
large
expensive
project
--
the
payoff
on
this
is
estimated
as
50
years.
and
he
may
be
there
a
year
of
two
and
pull
out
and
leave
the
landlord
with
$3
½
or
$4
a
year
assessment
to
pay
on
this
project.
i
agree
that
it
doesn't
seem
on
itself
on
the
surface
to
be
fair,
except
that
you
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
and
i
think
it
is
more
fair
to
draw
the
line
against
the
lessees
that
it
would
be
to
set
up
a
residency
requirement
and
draw
the
line
against
--
but
non-resident
landowners
who
have
a
very
direct
interest
in
both
the
benefits
and
the
cost
of
this
project.
secondly,
i
really
believe
that
this
isn't
again
a
matter
of
government
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
they
wouldn't,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
am
differentiating
here
again,
mr.
justice,
between
--
if
the
lessee
is
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
here
again
the
lessees
would
not
have
to
come
up
here.
if
lessees
were
allowed
to
vote
without
a
residency
requirement.
if
there
is
a
residency
requirement,
i
am
not
worried
about
fraud,
because
i
don't
think
they
are
going
to
move
lessees
into
the
area
and
make
them
stay
there
almost
till
they
fill
up
the
lessee,
let's
say
a
fractional
residency
requirement.
it's
a
pretty
remote
and
cold
area.
but
i
do
think
that
then,
you
are
probably
excluding
a
great
many
people
who
are
directly
interested
in
the
thing,
and
there
are
non-residents,
or
even
non-citizens,
non-persons
as
these
corporations,
who
should
be
allowed
to
vote
at.
i
don't
think
you
could
device
a
fair
system.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
injustice
here.
no
large
landowner
can
force
through
a
vote,
on
his
small
neighbors
because
it
has
to
be
pass
by
a
majority
of
the
people.
conversely,
no
group
of
small
landowners
could
come
in
and
force
a
project
against
one
large
landowner
who
would
have
the
burden
of
pain
for
it.
because
it
must
pass
by
a
majority
of
the
acreage.
and
limiting
it
to
landowners
here
again
is
the
only
logical
way
that
it
can
be
done,
i
think.
here
again,
i
think
it
should
be
differentiated
from
a
governmental
unit.
it
is
a
governmental
entity,
but
it
exercises
no
sovereign
power
over
the
people.
none
of
the
---
it's
more
in
the
nature
of
a
quasi-private
corporation
or
quasi-public.
it
has
a
power
to
levy
and
collect
assessments,
which
almost
any
mutual
company
would
have.
it
has
the
power
to
buy
and
sell
real
estate
and
personal
property
and
the
power
to
borrow
money
and
sell
bonds
which
any
private
corporation
can
do.
it
does
have
the
power
to
receive
government
grants
and
loans,
that
i
think,
the
(inaudible)
corporation
has
that
power
also.
and
it
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
now
there
seems
to
be
in
counsel's
brief,
a
great
distinction
made
because
of
this
branding
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
every
private
or
public
utility
has
the
power
to
eminent
domain.
so
i
think
this
thing
has
much
more
in
common
with
private
corporations
than
it
does
with
any
public
governmental
entity.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no,
we
have
a
meeting,
and
they
come
in
and
vote.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
individual
representatives
of
the
corporation.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yes,
in
this
instance,
this
is
a
small
community
and
there
is
no
question
about
who
is
the
owner
of
the
corporation
and
also
the
land.
in
the
course
only
one
man
would
be
allowed.
here
again
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yes,
it
is
an
open
meeting
and
there
is
quite
an
involved
due
notice
requirement
here.
every
time
anything
is
done
by
this
thing,
by
the
watershed
district,
due
notice
must
be
given
in
and
it
must
be
posted
at
four
or
five
places
prominent
in
the
district
which
is
kind
of
hard
to
do,
when
there
ranches
are
ten
miles
are
apart,
they
post
them
on
the
bridge
post
and
it
has
to
be
advertised
in
the
newspaper
in
the
area
for
three
weeks
i
think,
prior
to
that
time.
so
there
is
good
notice
given,
not
only
that
but
because
we
anticipated
that
there
will
be
problems
in
the
first
place,
we
always
send
certified
letters
to
everyone
of
the
voters,
giving
them
due
notice
of
any
elections.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
they
only
have
one
market
and
that's
united
states
government,
the
bonds
as
such
are
merely
security
for
the
obligation
under
the
fha
rules.
it'd
be
interesting
to
see
how
they
were
foreclosed
on
those
bonds,
if
they
had
to
since
almost
all
of
the
land
involved
was
privately
mortgaged
to
insurance
companies
or
to
the
state
of
wyoming,
prior
to
this
time.
so
the
bonds
are
an
overriding
obligation
on
the
watershed
district,
and
they
had
quite
a
time
collecting
on
them
if
they
were
to
pay.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
well,
they
are
really
not
a
private
debt,
there
are
debt
of
the
watershed
district
itself,
and
the
land
under
assessment
is
of
course
subject
to
leans
or
assessments,
but
--
and
it
might
be
subject
to
foreclosure
by
these,
but
i
think
the
government
would
have
step
in
pay
off,
lot
of
insurance
company
loans
before
they
can
do
it.
it
isn't
spelled
up
very
well.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no,
the
statute
does
not
say
something.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
no,
it
hasn't
been
adjudicated.
i
don't
know
whether
they're
subordinate
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
i
don't
--
i
am
sorry,
i
think
you
are
right,
it
wouldn't
be
subordinate
but
the
assessments
are
not
subordinate.
but
the
assessments
don't
represent
the
bonds.
the
assessments
are
merely
--
assessments
made
by
the
districts
to
help
pay
the
bills
of
the
districts,
and
it
could
not
only
be
bonds
but
improvements
and
everything
else.
and
the
assessments
are
an
obligation
owing
to
the
district
from
that
landowner.
there
is
no
other
obligation,
from
the
district
to
the
federal
government
for
the
loan
except
the
bonds,
and
what
their
priority
is,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that's
right.
here
again
i
don't
know
what
the
priority
is,
that
would
be
--
mr.
fred
w.
phifer
that
might
be.
thank
you
gentleman.
