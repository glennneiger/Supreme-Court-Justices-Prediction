mr.
henry
a.
burgess
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
appeal
from
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
affirming
a
judgment
which
was
entered
by
the
state
district
court
for
albany
county,
wyoming.
the
mandate
and
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
found
that
certain
wyoming
statutes
providing
for
the
creation
of
a
watershed
improvement
district
do
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
fourteenth
amendment
united
states
constitution.
this
action
was
commenced
by
the
toltec
watershed
improvement
district
which
is
organized
under
the
provision
of
the
watershed
improvement
district
law
of
wyoming
seeking
the
entry
upon
the
lands
belonging
to
the
associated
enterprises
for
the
purpose
of
surveying
and
drilling
a
dam
site.
preliminary
to
the
construction
of
a
dam.
the
lands
involved
are
owned
by
associated
enterprises
that
are
under
lease
to
the
johnston
fuel
liners.
johnston
fuel
liners
as
lessee
was
not
allowed
to
vote
in
the
election
which
created
the
district.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
it
is
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
on
page
19
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
stipulation
of
the
facts,
and
paragraph
3
says
that
johnston
fuel
liners
is
not
a
land
owner.
as
defined
by
ws
1957
so
forth,
and
although
given
notice
at
the
time
and
place
to
the
referendum
had
no
legal
right
to
vote
and
did
not
vote.
that
was
in
the
stipulation
of
the
facts.
this
case
was
not
actually
tried.
it
was
submitted.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
that
is
correct.
they
alleged
that
they
are
in
possession
of
the
land
and
then
there
was
an
order
and
judgment
from
which
the
appeal
was
taken
and
on
page
24,
in
the
interrogatory,
and
interrogatory
number
3,
has
thus
used,
starting
from
bottom
of
the
page
23
and
we
go
down
through
the
interrogatories,
the
second
interrogatory
says
that
they
commenced
using
lands
in
1959.
the
use
was
continuous
since
1959
to
the
date
of
the
answer
of
the
interrogatories.
interrogatory
number
4
says,
associated
enterprises
had
purchase
some
cattle
in
1969,
around
the
cattle
and
lands
in
toltec
district,
then
in
entry
or
interrogatory
number
5,
it
talks
about
the
lease
agreement
between
these
two
companies
and
the
exchange
of
use
of
various
lands.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
i
believe
then
the
supreme
court
--
the
order
of
intervention
of
course,
johnston
fuel
liners
is
not
rich
as
your
party
defendant
and
they
were
allowed
to
intervene
and
in
the
motion
it
says,
that
--
this
is
again
on
pages
14
and
15
of
the
motion,
that
they
were
a
lessee
and
the
entry
of
the
lands
upon
toltec,
up
the
entry
by
toltec
upon
the
lands
of
johnston
fuel
liners
and
their
interference
to
move
and
strikes
to
its
use
and
possession
of
the
lands.
that's
on
pages
14
in
the
appendix.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
i
would
resume
that
you
could
term
it
that.
say
two
cooperations
own
lands
which
are
intermingled
and
one
of
them
uses
lands
in
one
area
and
one
uses
the
other,
there
is
a
monthly
payment,
i
would
take
it
that
it
is
a
tenancywhich
could
be
revoked
at
the
end
of
any
annual
period
of
time.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
yes
i
would
think
that
the
interest
of
any
user
of
this
land
who
occupies
it,
that
his
interest
is
as
great
as
the
interest
of
any
person
who
owns
a
title
to
that
land.
secondly,
of
course
anything
which
affects
the
rent
which
would
be
charged
upon
that
land
would
also
affect
a
person
who
uses
that
land.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
no
your
honor
i
think
that
the
right
to
vote
is
something
that
is
granted
by
this
particular
case
by
this
particular
act.
the
act
says
that
a
land
owner
may
vote,
and
all
other
parties
were
excluded.
so
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
are
not
a
land
owner,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
while
your
tenancyis
wanted
sufferance
for
a
year
or
for
99
years,
in
any
event
you
are
excluded
from
voting.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct
i
understand
that
and
that
is
why
in
the
interrogatories
and
the
order
of
the
court,
the
court
did
allow
johnston
fuel
liners
to
intervene
finding
perhaps
not
expressly
but
certainly
by
implication
and
as
a
general
orders
that
all
of
the
facts
and
legal
conclusions
necessary
enter
the
order
or
embodies
in
that
order.
as
i
say,
the
case
arises
under
the
statutes
of
relating
to
the
watershed
improvement
district
and
the
purposes
of
that
district
of
course,
or
to
provide
for
the
prevention
and
control
of
erosion,
flood
water,
sediment
damage
is
to
provide
for
storage,
conservation,
development,
utilization
and
disposal
of
water,
there
by
to
preserve
and
protect
land
and
water
resources.
it
is
also
designed
as
statutory
purpose
states,
from
all
the
health,
safety
and
general
welfare,
the
people
they
state.
now,
this
district
is
formed
by
the
written
petition
being
filed
by
land
owners
with
the
board
of
directors,
what
is
called
water
and
soil
conservation
district
which
board
then
determines
whether
or
not
in
their
opinion
the
district
would
be
feasible.
thereafter,
if
it
is
determined
that
it
would
be
feasible
a
referendum
has
had.
our
statute
provides
no
qualifications
for
the
boarders
except
that
you
have
to
be
a
land
owner.
the
land
owner
is
defined
by
the
statute
that
as
being
one
who
holds
the
legal
title
or
is
acquiring
title
by
a
contract.
there
is
no
qualification
as
to
residence,
a
non-resident
land
owner,
one
outside
of
the
state
may
vote,
a
minor
may
vote
by
a
guardian
and
deceased
to
state
by
an
executive
and
there
is
no
registration
requirement.
now
prior
to
the
actual
casting
of
the
ballot,
the
land
owner
must
make
an
affidavit
in
which
he
states
the
number
of
acres
he
owned.
he
then
votes
and
as
the
ballots
are
counted
and
in
order
to
pass
the
referendum
must
have
voting
in
favor
of
it,
a
majority
of
the
land
owners
who
also
represent
a
majority
of
the
acres.
so
in
effect
the
vote
is
weighted.
now,
after
the
creation
of
the
district,
a
board
of
directors
is
elected
to
operate
a
district,
there
are
five
of
them
and
in
order
to
be
nominated
you
have
to
be
nominated
by
ten
land
owners.
upon
the
creation
of
the
district,
the
statute
states
it
constitutes
a
governmental
subdivision
of
the
state
and
a
public
body
corporate
and
politic,
they
have
the
authority
to
levy
taxes,
make
assessments,
build
structures,
accept
grants,
apportion
benefits
against
irrigated
lands.
they
also
have
the
authority
to
submit
to
the
land
owners,
a
proposition
for
the
issuance
of
the
bonds.
now,
once
again,
only
the
land
owners
vote
on
the
bonds,
the
vote
must
carry
by
two-thirds
of
the
land
owners
voting.
and
those
two-thirds
must
own
a
majority
of
the
acreage.
so
once
again
you
have
a
waiting
of
the
vote
in
comparison
to
number
of
acre
zone.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
argued
of
course,
in
the
lower
courts
that
the
limiting
of
voter
franchise
to
the
land
owners
in
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
watershed
improvement
district
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
clause
and
that
it
creates
an
unreasonable
arbitrary
and
capricious
voting
classification.
the
second
argument
was
that
the
weighting
of
these
votes
by
requiring
a
majority
of
the
acreage
is
at
the
basement
of
the
votes
and
the
people
resident
in
the
district
and
the
owners
of
small
acreages.
our
supreme
court
held
that
while
wyoming
is
always
recognized
the
distinction
between
governmental
and
proprietary
functions
of
a
legal
subdivision
and
that
this
was
a
legal
subdivision,
that
a
watershed
improvement
district
functions
are
primarily
proprietary,
and
then
they
stated
that
the
appellants
in
that
case
would
fail
to
show
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
classification
of
the
burden
showing
this
classification
of
orders
was
upon
the
appellant.
our
court
also
made
the
observation
that
there
is
an
overreaction
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
both
by
judges
and
lawyers,
that
the
one
man
one
vote
rule
has
been
extended
to
a
local
specialized
unit
of
government,
and
wyoming
supreme
court
rejected
the
idea
or
extend
the
rules
include
such
water
a
improvement
district.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
what
if
it
were
to
be?
it
couldn't
be
under
our
statute.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
i
think
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
the
corporate
lessee
in
this
case
would
not
have
a
right
to
vote,
if
as
the
justice
says,
it
were
upon
the
basis
of
an
individual
person
voting.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
my
understanding,
that
is
the
law
that
it
would
be
constitutional.
now,
the
corporate
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
sir.
i
didn't
--.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
because
we
contend
that
is
a
unreasonable
and
capricious
exclusion.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
what
we
are
talking
about
here
as
i
understand
it,
in
a
sense
is
the
purpose
of
an
election
and
running
counter
and
at
the
same
time
going
along
with
that
is
a
question
of
the
qualification
of
a
voter.
now
i
think
that
when
you
vote
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
and
voting
the
acreage.
you
wait
the
vote.
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
voting
the
number
of
acres
you
own.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
right.
what
we
are
talking
about
as
i
understand,
in
these
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
is
people
and
certainly
not
acres,
the
corporations.
in
the
cipriano
case,
you
are
talking
about
striking
down
a
statute
that
was
provided
for
the
passage
of
sewer
bonds.
now
there
is
really
no
difference
between
this
case
and
that
case,
and
one
case
of
sewage
is
what
you
are
talking
about
on
a
bond
issue,
in
this
case
we
are
trying
to
get
the
water.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
the
bonds
are
paid
by
the
owner
of
the
land
who
benefits
from
the
improvements
made
in
form
of
the
dam,
and
canals
and
ditches.
now
in
the
instance
that
is
assessed
against
the
land
owner.
he
is
the
one
who
has
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
that
are
collected
by
the
county
treasure,
for
failure
to
pay
the
tax
as
the
land
is
sold
under
the
regular
laws
relating
to
delinquency
taxes.
we
contend
that
that
payment
and
the
case
below,
the
lessee
is
passed
over
to
the
lessee,
in
increased
breadths.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
it
is
based
upon
the
value
of
benefits
on
certain
acres,
for
instance,
if
a
total
project
had
cost
$100,000
and
there
is
10,000
acres,
it
must
be
$10
per
acres,
would
be
the
assessment.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
property
owners.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
only
property
owners.
it
is
my
understanding
that's
cipriano
v.
city
of
houma.
in
that
case
they
are
talking
about
paying
for
the
bonds,
for
the
sewage,
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
paying
for
the
bonds
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
water.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
anybody
in
the
district
has
a
right
to
vote.
i
think
that
in
this
day
and
age,
with
government
being
as
complex
as
it
is
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
no,
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
but
i
think
that
the
people
have
the
right
to
vote.
now
we
are
talking
about
an
arid
state
and
there
are
only
three
things
that
value
in
wyoming,
those
years
they
had
no
water
and
the
water
is
an
illusory
transitory
thing
and
if
you
don't
get
the
water
when
it's
there
and
if
you
don't
use
it,
is
forever
gone,
or
you
have
it
and
you
have
wealth,
you
have
homes,
you
have
an
irrigated
farms,
you
have
towns,
you
have
communities.
it
is
our
contention
that
everybody
in
the
community
whether
it
is
an
irrigated
has
a
vital
interest.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
doctrine
of
prior
appropriations.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
we
go
on
a
doctrine
of
priority,
if
you
have,
we
have
four
prime
preferred
uses,
if
you
have
a
preferred
use
which
is
subsequent
in
time
to
an
irrigation
right,
the
irrigation
right
prevails,
however
the
preferred
right
can
wyoming
domain
take
the
prior
use
or
on
the
scale--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
the
contemplated
use
is
used
for
agricultural
purposes.
now
wyoming
is
growing,
i
suppose
and
in
a
sense
it
could
be
used,
it
would
be
kept
in
wyoming--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
it
would
have
to
be
purchased
by
someone
else.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
that's
correct
you
have
to
file
to
the
state
engineer,
make
a
beneficial
use
of
the
water
and
then
you
get
a
water
right.
but
this
is
the
facility
and
the
structure.
now,
pardon
me,
but
under
this
the
water
district
could
file
an
application
to
construct
a
dam
and
get
what
they
call
a
primary
permit
which
would
authorize
them
to
then
impound
and
store
within
the
dam
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
districts
of
water.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
of
the
members
and
also
be
used
for
recreational
purposes,
fishing.
we
also
submit
that
this
is
a
case
which
probably
was
raised
by
the
dissent
of
justice
harlan,
which
he
said
that
on
this
day,
i
pleaded
the
hadley
case,
this
principle
which
was
handed
down
at
a
case
applies
to
an
irrigation
district
and
for
all
of
the
reasons
enunciated
by
this
court
in
previous
cases,
we
feel
it's
only
logical
that
this
press-school
be
applied
to
the
watershed
improvement
district
tax
of
the
state
of
wyoming.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court,
several
observations
i
make,
but
one
of
them
is,
and
i
think
we
got
a
little
bit
outside
of
the
record
here,
discussing
this
district.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
there
is
gerrymandering
went
on
here,
johnston
fuel
liners
does
have
a
number
of
employees
who
do
reside
in
the
district
of
course,
they
were
not
allowed
to
vote.
the
site
for
their
proposed
dam,
where
take
in
and
destroy
much
of
the
land
of
associated
enterprises
who
in
turn
have
upstream
dams,
and
what
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
i
will
stop
it
your
honor,
if
you
don't
believe,
it
shouldn't
go
on,
but
the
point
is
that
people
did
decide,
it
was
said
there
was
two
big
landowners
and
they
voted
the
acreage
and
that's
how
we
are
here.
now,
this
business
of
voting,
i
can't
visualize
as
one
of
the
justices
said,
anybody
moving
to
the
laramie
peak
country,
was
at
least
just
to
vote,
and
i
am
sure
that
every
election
case,
which
is
brought
before
this
court
has
thrown
out
to
it,
this
bug-a-boo
about
fraud
in
elections,
and
that's
no
problem.
a
small
community
like
wyoming,
at
first
place
we
all
think
we
are
honest,
secondly,
the
people
come
in
and
they
are
pretty
well
known
to
their
neighbors
and
they
are
that.
when
you
get
all
through
looking
at
this
case,
i
think
that
historically
these
cases
started
on
a
question
of
voting
for
congress
and
then
it
got
over
to
voting
of
a
school
trustee,
and
then
the
county
commissioner,
and
you
keep
growing
down
and
down
and
down
into
the
spectrum
of
local
self-government,
and
we
contend
that
this
principle
should
also
be
extended
into
the
lower
unit
of
this
particular
water
improvement
district.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct,
or
you
have
an
individual.
and
i
would
just
like
to
point
that
up,
the
saying
that
this
case
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
i
think
there
maybe
12
families
that
voted
for,
i
am
not
sure
the
exact
vote,
there
were
three
who
voted
against
as
i
understand,
but
there
are
more
families
involved
above
the
upper
limit
which
are
interested
in
this,
and
of
course,
they
were
brought
in.
if
this
is
a
live
issue
in
the
community,
it's
a
very
live
issue
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
both.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
certainly
they
should
be
allowed
to
vote,
but
they
weren't,
they
weren't
even
put
into
the
proposed
boundary.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
no.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
that's
correct,
that's
probably
it
was.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
that's
for
this
court
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well
i
suppose
not,
except
it
is
a
governmental,
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
appeal
from
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
affirming
a
judgment
which
was
entered
by
the
state
district
court
for
albany
county,
wyoming.
the
mandate
and
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
found
that
certain
wyoming
statutes
providing
for
the
creation
of
a
watershed
improvement
district
do
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
fourteenth
amendment
united
states
constitution.
this
action
was
commenced
by
the
toltec
watershed
improvement
district
which
is
organized
under
the
provision
of
the
watershed
improvement
district
law
of
wyoming
seeking
the
entry
upon
the
lands
belonging
to
the
associated
enterprises
for
the
purpose
of
surveying
and
drilling
a
dam
site.
preliminary
to
the
construction
of
a
dam.
the
lands
involved
are
owned
by
associated
enterprises
that
are
under
lease
to
the
johnston
fuel
liners.
johnston
fuel
liners
as
lessee
was
not
allowed
to
vote
in
the
election
which
created
the
district.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
it
is
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
on
page
19
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
stipulation
of
the
facts,
and
paragraph
3
says
that
johnston
fuel
liners
is
not
a
land
owner.
as
defined
by
ws
1957
so
forth,
and
although
given
notice
at
the
time
and
place
to
the
referendum
had
no
legal
right
to
vote
and
did
not
vote.
that
was
in
the
stipulation
of
the
facts.
this
case
was
not
actually
tried.
it
was
submitted.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
that
is
correct.
they
alleged
that
they
are
in
possession
of
the
land
and
then
there
was
an
order
and
judgment
from
which
the
appeal
was
taken
and
on
page
24,
in
the
interrogatory,
and
interrogatory
number
3,
has
thus
used,
starting
from
bottom
of
the
page
23
and
we
go
down
through
the
interrogatories,
the
second
interrogatory
says
that
they
commenced
using
lands
in
1959.
the
use
was
continuous
since
1959
to
the
date
of
the
answer
of
the
interrogatories.
interrogatory
number
4
says,
associated
enterprises
had
purchase
some
cattle
in
1969,
around
the
cattle
and
lands
in
toltec
district,
then
in
entry
or
interrogatory
number
5,
it
talks
about
the
lease
agreement
between
these
two
companies
and
the
exchange
of
use
of
various
lands.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
i
believe
then
the
supreme
court
--
the
order
of
intervention
of
course,
johnston
fuel
liners
is
not
rich
as
your
party
defendant
and
they
were
allowed
to
intervene
and
in
the
motion
it
says,
that
--
this
is
again
on
pages
14
and
15
of
the
motion,
that
they
were
a
lessee
and
the
entry
of
the
lands
upon
toltec,
up
the
entry
by
toltec
upon
the
lands
of
johnston
fuel
liners
and
their
interference
to
move
and
strikes
to
its
use
and
possession
of
the
lands.
that's
on
pages
14
in
the
appendix.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
i
would
resume
that
you
could
term
it
that.
say
two
cooperations
own
lands
which
are
intermingled
and
one
of
them
uses
lands
in
one
area
and
one
uses
the
other,
there
is
a
monthly
payment,
i
would
take
it
that
it
is
a
tenancywhich
could
be
revoked
at
the
end
of
any
annual
period
of
time.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
yes
i
would
think
that
the
interest
of
any
user
of
this
land
who
occupies
it,
that
his
interest
is
as
great
as
the
interest
of
any
person
who
owns
a
title
to
that
land.
secondly,
of
course
anything
which
affects
the
rent
which
would
be
charged
upon
that
land
would
also
affect
a
person
who
uses
that
land.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
no
your
honor
i
think
that
the
right
to
vote
is
something
that
is
granted
by
this
particular
case
by
this
particular
act.
the
act
says
that
a
land
owner
may
vote,
and
all
other
parties
were
excluded.
so
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
are
not
a
land
owner,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
while
your
tenancyis
wanted
sufferance
for
a
year
or
for
99
years,
in
any
event
you
are
excluded
from
voting.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct
i
understand
that
and
that
is
why
in
the
interrogatories
and
the
order
of
the
court,
the
court
did
allow
johnston
fuel
liners
to
intervene
finding
perhaps
not
expressly
but
certainly
by
implication
and
as
a
general
orders
that
all
of
the
facts
and
legal
conclusions
necessary
enter
the
order
or
embodies
in
that
order.
as
i
say,
the
case
arises
under
the
statutes
of
relating
to
the
watershed
improvement
district
and
the
purposes
of
that
district
of
course,
or
to
provide
for
the
prevention
and
control
of
erosion,
flood
water,
sediment
damage
is
to
provide
for
storage,
conservation,
development,
utilization
and
disposal
of
water,
there
by
to
preserve
and
protect
land
and
water
resources.
it
is
also
designed
as
statutory
purpose
states,
from
all
the
health,
safety
and
general
welfare,
the
people
they
state.
now,
this
district
is
formed
by
the
written
petition
being
filed
by
land
owners
with
the
board
of
directors,
what
is
called
water
and
soil
conservation
district
which
board
then
determines
whether
or
not
in
their
opinion
the
district
would
be
feasible.
thereafter,
if
it
is
determined
that
it
would
be
feasible
a
referendum
has
had.
our
statute
provides
no
qualifications
for
the
boarders
except
that
you
have
to
be
a
land
owner.
the
land
owner
is
defined
by
the
statute
that
as
being
one
who
holds
the
legal
title
or
is
acquiring
title
by
a
contract.
there
is
no
qualification
as
to
residence,
a
non-resident
land
owner,
one
outside
of
the
state
may
vote,
a
minor
may
vote
by
a
guardian
and
deceased
to
state
by
an
executive
and
there
is
no
registration
requirement.
now
prior
to
the
actual
casting
of
the
ballot,
the
land
owner
must
make
an
affidavit
in
which
he
states
the
number
of
acres
he
owned.
he
then
votes
and
as
the
ballots
are
counted
and
in
order
to
pass
the
referendum
must
have
voting
in
favor
of
it,
a
majority
of
the
land
owners
who
also
represent
a
majority
of
the
acres.
so
in
effect
the
vote
is
weighted.
now,
after
the
creation
of
the
district,
a
board
of
directors
is
elected
to
operate
a
district,
there
are
five
of
them
and
in
order
to
be
nominated
you
have
to
be
nominated
by
ten
land
owners.
upon
the
creation
of
the
district,
the
statute
states
it
constitutes
a
governmental
subdivision
of
the
state
and
a
public
body
corporate
and
politic,
they
have
the
authority
to
levy
taxes,
make
assessments,
build
structures,
accept
grants,
apportion
benefits
against
irrigated
lands.
they
also
have
the
authority
to
submit
to
the
land
owners,
a
proposition
for
the
issuance
of
the
bonds.
now,
once
again,
only
the
land
owners
vote
on
the
bonds,
the
vote
must
carry
by
two-thirds
of
the
land
owners
voting.
and
those
two-thirds
must
own
a
majority
of
the
acreage.
so
once
again
you
have
a
waiting
of
the
vote
in
comparison
to
number
of
acre
zone.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
argued
of
course,
in
the
lower
courts
that
the
limiting
of
voter
franchise
to
the
land
owners
in
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
watershed
improvement
district
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
clause
and
that
it
creates
an
unreasonable
arbitrary
and
capricious
voting
classification.
the
second
argument
was
that
the
weighting
of
these
votes
by
requiring
a
majority
of
the
acreage
is
at
the
basement
of
the
votes
and
the
people
resident
in
the
district
and
the
owners
of
small
acreages.
our
supreme
court
held
that
while
wyoming
is
always
recognized
the
distinction
between
governmental
and
proprietary
functions
of
a
legal
subdivision
and
that
this
was
a
legal
subdivision,
that
a
watershed
improvement
district
functions
are
primarily
proprietary,
and
then
they
stated
that
the
appellants
in
that
case
would
fail
to
show
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
classification
of
the
burden
showing
this
classification
of
orders
was
upon
the
appellant.
our
court
also
made
the
observation
that
there
is
an
overreaction
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
both
by
judges
and
lawyers,
that
the
one
man
one
vote
rule
has
been
extended
to
a
local
specialized
unit
of
government,
and
wyoming
supreme
court
rejected
the
idea
or
extend
the
rules
include
such
water
a
improvement
district.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
what
if
it
were
to
be?
it
couldn't
be
under
our
statute.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
i
think
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
the
corporate
lessee
in
this
case
would
not
have
a
right
to
vote,
if
as
the
justice
says,
it
were
upon
the
basis
of
an
individual
person
voting.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
my
understanding,
that
is
the
law
that
it
would
be
constitutional.
now,
the
corporate
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
sir.
i
didn't
--.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
because
we
contend
that
is
a
unreasonable
and
capricious
exclusion.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
what
we
are
talking
about
here
as
i
understand
it,
in
a
sense
is
the
purpose
of
an
election
and
running
counter
and
at
the
same
time
going
along
with
that
is
a
question
of
the
qualification
of
a
voter.
now
i
think
that
when
you
vote
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
and
voting
the
acreage.
you
wait
the
vote.
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
voting
the
number
of
acres
you
own.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
right.
what
we
are
talking
about
as
i
understand,
in
these
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
is
people
and
certainly
not
acres,
the
corporations.
in
the
cipriano
case,
you
are
talking
about
striking
down
a
statute
that
was
provided
for
the
passage
of
sewer
bonds.
now
there
is
really
no
difference
between
this
case
and
that
case,
and
one
case
of
sewage
is
what
you
are
talking
about
on
a
bond
issue,
in
this
case
we
are
trying
to
get
the
water.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
the
bonds
are
paid
by
the
owner
of
the
land
who
benefits
from
the
improvements
made
in
form
of
the
dam,
and
canals
and
ditches.
now
in
the
instance
that
is
assessed
against
the
land
owner.
he
is
the
one
who
has
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
that
are
collected
by
the
county
treasure,
for
failure
to
pay
the
tax
as
the
land
is
sold
under
the
regular
laws
relating
to
delinquency
taxes.
we
contend
that
that
payment
and
the
case
below,
the
lessee
is
passed
over
to
the
lessee,
in
increased
breadths.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
it
is
based
upon
the
value
of
benefits
on
certain
acres,
for
instance,
if
a
total
project
had
cost
$100,000
and
there
is
10,000
acres,
it
must
be
$10
per
acres,
would
be
the
assessment.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
property
owners.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
only
property
owners.
it
is
my
understanding
that's
cipriano
v.
city
of
houma.
in
that
case
they
are
talking
about
paying
for
the
bonds,
for
the
sewage,
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
paying
for
the
bonds
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
water.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
anybody
in
the
district
has
a
right
to
vote.
i
think
that
in
this
day
and
age,
with
government
being
as
complex
as
it
is
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
no,
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
but
i
think
that
the
people
have
the
right
to
vote.
now
we
are
talking
about
an
arid
state
and
there
are
only
three
things
that
value
in
wyoming,
those
years
they
had
no
water
and
the
water
is
an
illusory
transitory
thing
and
if
you
don't
get
the
water
when
it's
there
and
if
you
don't
use
it,
is
forever
gone,
or
you
have
it
and
you
have
wealth,
you
have
homes,
you
have
an
irrigated
farms,
you
have
towns,
you
have
communities.
it
is
our
contention
that
everybody
in
the
community
whether
it
is
an
irrigated
has
a
vital
interest.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
doctrine
of
prior
appropriations.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
we
go
on
a
doctrine
of
priority,
if
you
have,
we
have
four
prime
preferred
uses,
if
you
have
a
preferred
use
which
is
subsequent
in
time
to
an
irrigation
right,
the
irrigation
right
prevails,
however
the
preferred
right
can
wyoming
domain
take
the
prior
use
or
on
the
scale--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
the
contemplated
use
is
used
for
agricultural
purposes.
now
wyoming
is
growing,
i
suppose
and
in
a
sense
it
could
be
used,
it
would
be
kept
in
wyoming--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
it
would
have
to
be
purchased
by
someone
else.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
that's
correct
you
have
to
file
to
the
state
engineer,
make
a
beneficial
use
of
the
water
and
then
you
get
a
water
right.
but
this
is
the
facility
and
the
structure.
now,
pardon
me,
but
under
this
the
water
district
could
file
an
application
to
construct
a
dam
and
get
what
they
call
a
primary
permit
which
would
authorize
them
to
then
impound
and
store
within
the
dam
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
districts
of
water.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
of
the
members
and
also
be
used
for
recreational
purposes,
fishing.
we
also
submit
that
this
is
a
case
which
probably
was
raised
by
the
dissent
of
justice
harlan,
which
he
said
that
on
this
day,
i
pleaded
the
hadley
case,
this
principle
which
was
handed
down
at
a
case
applies
to
an
irrigation
district
and
for
all
of
the
reasons
enunciated
by
this
court
in
previous
cases,
we
feel
it's
only
logical
that
this
press-school
be
applied
to
the
watershed
improvement
district
tax
of
the
state
of
wyoming.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court,
several
observations
i
make,
but
one
of
them
is,
and
i
think
we
got
a
little
bit
outside
of
the
record
here,
discussing
this
district.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
there
is
gerrymandering
went
on
here,
johnston
fuel
liners
does
have
a
number
of
employees
who
do
reside
in
the
district
of
course,
they
were
not
allowed
to
vote.
the
site
for
their
proposed
dam,
where
take
in
and
destroy
much
of
the
land
of
associated
enterprises
who
in
turn
have
upstream
dams,
and
what
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
i
will
stop
it
your
honor,
if
you
don't
believe,
it
shouldn't
go
on,
but
the
point
is
that
people
did
decide,
it
was
said
there
was
two
big
landowners
and
they
voted
the
acreage
and
that's
how
we
are
here.
now,
this
business
of
voting,
i
can't
visualize
as
one
of
the
justices
said,
anybody
moving
to
the
laramie
peak
country,
was
at
least
just
to
vote,
and
i
am
sure
that
every
election
case,
which
is
brought
before
this
court
has
thrown
out
to
it,
this
bug-a-boo
about
fraud
in
elections,
and
that's
no
problem.
a
small
community
like
wyoming,
at
first
place
we
all
think
we
are
honest,
secondly,
the
people
come
in
and
they
are
pretty
well
known
to
their
neighbors
and
they
are
that.
when
you
get
all
through
looking
at
this
case,
i
think
that
historically
these
cases
started
on
a
question
of
voting
for
congress
and
then
it
got
over
to
voting
of
a
school
trustee,
and
then
the
county
commissioner,
and
you
keep
growing
down
and
down
and
down
into
the
spectrum
of
local
self-government,
and
we
contend
that
this
principle
should
also
be
extended
into
the
lower
unit
of
this
particular
water
improvement
district.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct,
or
you
have
an
individual.
and
i
would
just
like
to
point
that
up,
the
saying
that
this
case
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
i
think
there
maybe
12
families
that
voted
for,
i
am
not
sure
the
exact
vote,
there
were
three
who
voted
against
as
i
understand,
but
there
are
more
families
involved
above
the
upper
limit
which
are
interested
in
this,
and
of
course,
they
were
brought
in.
if
this
is
a
live
issue
in
the
community,
it's
a
very
live
issue
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
both.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
certainly
they
should
be
allowed
to
vote,
but
they
weren't,
they
weren't
even
put
into
the
proposed
boundary.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
no.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
that's
correct,
that's
probably
it
was.
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well,
that's
for
this
court
--
mr.
henry
a.
burgess
well
i
suppose
not,
except
it
is
a
governmental,
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
thank
you.
