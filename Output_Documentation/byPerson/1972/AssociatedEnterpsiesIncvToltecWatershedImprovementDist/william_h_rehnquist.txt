justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
burgess
where
in
the
record
is
there
a
finding
by
either
the
trial
court
or
supreme
court
of
wyoming
that
johnston
fuel
liners
was
a
lessee
from
associated
enterprise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
about.
the
reason
i
asked
is
that
i
did
not
find
in
your
stipulation
of
facts.
i
found
it
in
questions
and
answers
submitted
in
interrogatory
form
but
i
did
not
find
any
finding
at
least
in
my
study
either
by
the
trial
court
of
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
that
assumed
it
as
a
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
at
least
the
johnston
fuel
liners
almost
having
this
based
on
the
land.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay
this
is
johnston
fuel
liners
position
i
realize,
but
how
are
we
to
know
that
either
the
trial
court
or
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
accepted
this
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bunch
of
it
i
get,
as
to
--
i
was
just
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
order
to
as
maintain
--
you
have
standard
to
maintain
your
constitutional
issue,
you
got
to
show
that
if
the
constitution
were
applied
in
the
way
you
say
it
be
then
your
client
would
end
up
having
right
to
vote.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
under
wyoming
law,
that
watershed
improvement
district
must
be
or
formed
on
the
vote
of
all
the
registered
voters
within
that
proposed
district?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
if
the
statute
just
provided
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
i
don't
know
why
your
corporate
lessee
shouldn't
demand
on
the
same
argument
demand
the
right
to
vote?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
they
wouldn't,
i
said
that
they
wouldn't
have
the
right
according
to
the
statute
but
would
the
statute
be
constitutional
if,
it
like
the
present
one
excluded
your
corporate
lessee
from
voting.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
can't
the
state
then
exclude
it
under
this
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can't
the
state
exclude
your
corporate
lessee
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
under
the
other
one,
if
you
would
have
exactly
the
same
interest.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
improvement
district
doesn't
acquire
any
water
rights
of
its
own
as
a
result
of
constructing
this
facility.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
but
the
water
it
does
store
is
not
for
its
own
benefit
as
such
but
simply
for
the
benefit
of
its
members?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
really
it
is
just
irrigated
pasture
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
you
harvest
the
hay.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
is
lessor
voted
in
the
fist
instance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
his
own
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
other
than
that
you
have
no
answer
to
give?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phifer,
justice
powell
as
mr.
burgess
about
the
case
of
cipriano,
do
you
read
cipriano
the
same
way
mr.
burgess
does
as
involving
a
obligation
that
was
to
be
ultimately
paid
only
by
property
owners?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
occasionally,
when
one
recalls
at
lease
cases
where
the
bond
owner
has
sought
an
action
against
the
issuer
to
make
the
issuer
take
such
action
as
it
can
by
marshaling
of
assets
to
collect
funds
that
maybe
available
to
it
but
not
directly
to
the
bond
owner.
i
take
it
that,
if
a
land
owner
fails
to
pay
an
assessment
made
by
this
district,
the
district
has
the
power
to
have
the
property
sold
to
pay
the
assessment
under
wyoming
bond.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
colleague
said
that
the
question
of
tenancy
at
sufferance
would

court,
was
not
decided
to
pass
by
them,
which
i
take
it
means,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
one
on
the
supreme
court
in
terms
of
its
right,
if
this
were
a
wholly
independent
lessee
with
a
lease
of
10
years.
