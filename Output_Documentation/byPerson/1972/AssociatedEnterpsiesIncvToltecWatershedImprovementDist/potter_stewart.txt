justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
you
have
a
case
here,
you
think
you
have
case
here
only
because
they
proceeded
on
the
basis
of
land
owners
being
voters?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
say
therefore,
it
is
just
they
proceed
on
the
basis
of
the
land
owners,
it's
invidious
to
exclude
lessee?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
priority
of
the
used
water
in
wyoming
to--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
got
in
to
the
conflict
between
the
domestic
consumption
and
irrigation?
justice
potter
stewart
the
water
conserved
by
this
district
might
be
available
or
higher
usage
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
have
to
be
bought.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
boards
were
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
the
stockholders
are
not
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
present
in
the
vicinity
of--
justice
potter
stewart
irrigated
meadows.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
bale
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
keep
the
cattle
there?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
winter
time.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
does
this
case
get
started?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
johnston
must
have
gone
against
the
formation?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
people
of
--
there
were
other
owners
who
own
more
land
that
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
outvoted
him?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
got
voted.
justice
potter
stewart
now
if
this
lessee
is
entitled
to
vote,
that
isn't
going
to
do
any
good
because
he
would
have
been
out
voted
also
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
set
what,
do
you
have
to
really
strike
down,
do
you
have
to
get
to
the
acreage
limitations
as
well
as--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
goes
down
rather
than
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
this
election
have
come
out
in
the
first
place
if
the
rule
had
been
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
let's
assume
this,
let's
assume
you
lose
this
suit?
justice
potter
stewart
no
i
was
just
asking
just
really
a
fair
reliable
law
suit.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
interest
would
the
other
side
have,
and
they
would
would
still
lose
this,
they
would
still
lose
the
election.
they
still
would
have
then
lost
the
election?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
the
situation
for
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
you
lose
this
lawsuit
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
you
lose
this
lawsuit
there
will
be
a
new
vote
that's
the
point
and
you
don't
know
how
that's
going
to
come
out.
justice
potter
stewart
except
that,
if
there
is
a
new
vote
as
you
say
one
of
the
land
owners
that
might
lease
an
acre
of
piece
to
200
people,
of
all
them
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
his
lessor.
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
you
distinguish
the
cases
where
--
say
there
is
really
no
difference
between
landowner
and
a
lessee.
i
mean
there
is
a
not
enough
difference
land
owner
and
the
lessee
to
warrant
its
duty
for
the
lessee
simply
because
the
landowner
has
the
formal
obligation
to
pay
the
bill.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
accept
that?
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
who
pays
the
bill?
justice
potter
stewart
it
so
happened
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
phifer,
some
little
time
ago,
you
were
contrasting
the
situation
here
with
what
you
called
a
popular
election,
and
as
you
rightly
said,
in
a
popular
election
generally
there
is
a
vote
in
polling
place
by
a
secret
ballot
by
individual
voters.
since
so
many
of
these
voters
are
corporation,
how
is
the
vote
taken,
is
it
public,
is
it
just
done
by
a
letter
or--
justice
potter
stewart
individual
representatives
of
the
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
who
in
question
show
their
authority
to
represent
the
corporation.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
a
public
meeting?
justice
potter
stewart
actual
notice
by
them.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
know
that
if
these
assessments
and
the
leans,
the
representatives
--
subordinate
with
the
private
lease,
does
the
statute
say
something?
justice
potter
stewart
this
hasn't
been
adjudicated?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice

it
