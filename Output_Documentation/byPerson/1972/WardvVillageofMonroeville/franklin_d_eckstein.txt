mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
franklin
eckstein.
i'm
the
solicitor
for
the
village
of
monroeville,
ohio.
i'd
like
to
first
say
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
about
trial
de
novo
and
i'm
just
a
country
lawyer
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
although
i
hesitate
to
differ
with
opposing
counsel,
there
was
a
right
to
trial
de
novo
at
the
time
of
ward's
case.
it
was
in
the
common
pleas
court.
but
ward
did
not
have
the
right
to
a
trial
de
novo
for
the
reason
that
he
had
brought
in
a
court
stenographer.
and
the
rule
then
was
the
same
as
the
rule
as
today
although
you
go
to
the
county
court
or
municipal
court.
that
rule
is,
once
you
bring
in
a
stenographer
and
all
the
evidence
is
reduced
to
a
record,
you
have
the
right
to
appeal
on
questions
of
law,
but
not
on
questions
of
fact.
and
back
then
as
today,
if
you
don't
bring
in
your
stenographer
and
you
go
before
the
mayor,
the
mayor
prepares
his
docket
form
which
is
a
single
piece
of
paper.
no
evidence
or
testimony
other
than
the
mayor's
finding
of
guilty
is
on
that
piece
of
paper
and
you
go
to
the
county
court
or
the
municipal
court
where
you
have
a
complete
new
trier
of
the
facts,
as
well
as
the
law.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
he
could
not
in
his
first
case
because
he
brought
in
a
stenographer
and
what
i'll
call
a
second
case
where
he
did
not
bring
one
in
and
simply
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
that
was
a
fear
to
produce
a
driver's
license.
it
was
related.
we
consolidated
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
that
case,
he
could
have
had
a
trial
de
novo,
if
he
had
chosen,
and
that
would
be
same
rule
of
law
today.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
what
happened
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
the
rule
was
that
if
you
bring
in
a
court
reporter
and
the
testimony
and
the
written
evidence
is
reduced
to
a
writings
when
you
appeal
from
the
mayor's
court,
you
only
get
a
review
of
the
questions
of
law.
you
do
not
get
a
review
of
the
question's
effect.
if
you
leave
the
stenographer
home
which
is
a
tactical
decision,
then
if
you
lose,
you
can
start
all
over
in
the
county
court
or
municipal
court
and
have
a
legislature
who
wanted
to
keep
this
system.
in
1970,
before
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
says,
“now,
the
question
they
asked
us,
would
we
prepare
supplemental
briefs
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
appeal
from
mayor's
court
into
the
common
pleas
court
was
gone
because
of
a
recent
amendment.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
that's
correct.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
but
to
go
back
to
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
this
was
true
then,
and
as
i
say,
i
would
hesitate
to
differ
with
any
interpretation
with
our
practice
in
county
courts
and
municipal
courts
as
well
as
mayor's
courts
in
the
--
in
the
surrounding
communities.
and
this
is
the
practice
where
we
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
it's
the
same.
the
only
difference
was
the
court
you
went
into
on
appeal
because
of
an
amendment
to
(inaudible)
constitution
that
made
that
appear
to
be
doubtful,
whether
you
could
appeal
in
common
pleas
court
the
legislature
not
waiting
on
a
decision
in
our
case
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
amended
that
law.
but
as
recently
as
1970,
they
kept
the
system
although
they
changed
the
court.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
it
was
not
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
the
provisions
if
you
--
they're
--
they're
now,
unfortunately
set
up
(inaudible)
that
if
you
read
the
provisions
as
the
way
it
worked
out
and
that's
in
our
practice,
that's
the
way
it
was.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah,
it's
an
appeal,
mr.
justice
white.
in
other
words,
the
judge
--
the
county
court
judge
would
--
could
have
heard
a
worse
case
than
that;
it
would
have
been
a
common
pleas
judge.
we
would
have
heard
the
evidence
that
wouldn't
have
been,
i
don't
think,
influenced
by
the
fact
that
a
mayor
had
found
the
man
guilty
or
--
or
of
course
if
he
was
not
guilty,
he
wouldn't
be
in
it,
for
the
prosecution.
but
i
don't
think
that
a
county
court
judge
would
have
been
influenced.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
see.
well,
i
presume
that
it
would
be
up
to
him
as
a
reviewing
judge
to
decide
whether
or
not
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
it's
not
a
new
trial.
it's
just
a
review
of
questions
of
law
and
it
would
be
only
a
question
of
evidence.
was
the
judgment
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
in
that
case,
i
think
you
would
have
to.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
not
when
there's
a
transcript.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
none
to
my
knowledge
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
if
he
felt
that
he
would
not
get
a
favorable
decision
in
that
particular
mayor's
court,
he
could
bring
in
a
stenographer
to
preserve
a
record
so
that
he
could
go
to
the
--
to
the
county
court
and
perhaps
--
and
perhaps
did
a
very
minimal
effort
in
terms
of
time,
isn't
just
written
briefs,
perhaps,
could
get
a
reversal.
and
--
but
that
would
be
the
only
real
reason
that
--
that
a
defendant
would
want
to
bring
in
a
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
think
that
that
could
be
a
possible
consideration.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
they
would
not
be
able
to,
and
in
this
case,
the
maximum
fine
would
have
been
$50.
you'd
have
to
follow
the
ordinance
and
there
would
have
been
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
it
would
have
been
tried
to
a
judge.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
not
under
a
higher
law.
he
brought
in
a
stenographer
and
--
and
he
forfeited
that
right
when
he
brought
the
stenographer
in.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
that
has
been
--
that
has
been
merged
into
the
second
offense
and
the
failure
to
ask
for
a
--
a
complete
retrial
for
facts
in
that
case,
in
my
estimation
would
have
waived
the
right.
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
as
we
view
it
in
--
in
the
case
of
mayor's
courts,
an
appeal
would
only
be
where
you
have
the
transcripts
and
the
question
would
be
a
question
to
whether
or
not
the
law
had
been
properly
applied
to
the
facts
as
they
appear
in
the
transcript,
whereas,
trial
de
novo,
as
we
understand
it,
is
a
complete
retrial
as
to
an
introduction
of
evidence
and
everything
else.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
all
i
can
say,
mr.
justice,
is
that
i
believe
that
the
legislature
in
weighing
to
keep
this
court
system
wanted
to
provide
every
protection
they
recently
could
and
still
keep
the
system.
it
is
indeed
a
unique
situation.
but
i'd
like
to
say
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
first
time
that
affidavit
for
--
for
prejudice
was
filed
in
the
monroeville
mayor's
court,
that
the
mayor
granted
the
--
the
motion
of
the
defendant
and
he
did
certify
the
cases
to
the
huron
county
court.
now,
begin
--
from
beginning
to
end,
the
constitutional
question
has
been
raised
and
in
raising
the
--
the
question
on
the
affidavit,
the
mayor
said,
“yes,
you're
right.”
he
certified
the
county
court.
and
the
case
sat
over
there
for
about
four
months
until
december
17,
1968,
when
the
county
court
judge
discovered
the
grounds
for
the
transferal
and
decided
he
did
not
have
original
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
and
sent
it
back
to
mayor
(inaudible)
we
saw
in
the
first
instance,
the
mayor,
i
think,
bent
over
backwards
to
be
fair.
and
unfortunately,
the
county
court
did
not
send
back
the
second
case
involving
the
driver's
license
until
january,
so
that
you
were
not
tried
together
at
the
same
time,
before
mayor
(inaudible)
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
the
point
--
the
point
was,
mr.
justice
that
once
that
the
county
court
judge
returned
the
case
to
him,
he
felt
obligated
to
go
forward
under
--
under
ohio
law.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
the
county
court
did
not
have
original
jurisdiction
in
that
instance
to
--
to
hear
that
case,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
fine
was
less
than
$50,
and
the
basis
for
the
--
the
motion
in
the
county
court
judge's
opinion
was
not
well-taken.
that
was
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
don't
see
how
they
could
have
done
other
than
have
the
--
have
a
substitute
county
court
judge
hear
the
case
because
i
can't
--
i've
--
i've
not
personally
had
that
experience,
but
i
don't
see
how
they
did
appoint
a
mayor
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
--
under
the
system,
i'll
tell
you
that's
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
let's
open
to
question,
possibly
the
president
of
council,
who
assumes
the
role
of
mayor
when
the
mayor
is
out
of
town
or
resigns,
perhaps
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
that's
--
that's
a
question
i
simply
can't
answer,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
my
--
my
suggestion
was
that
he
should
have
based
it
on
other
facts.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
in
this
case,
i
don't
see
how
it
--
how
it
could
have
been
other
than
a
county
court
judge,
but
possibly,
it
could
have
appointed
the
president
of
the
council,
let's
say.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah,
that's
right.
but
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
i'd
like
to
briefly
point
out
that
the
facts
of
life
in
a
small
town
simply
aren't
the
way
that
the
--
that
the
(inaudible)
by
the
council
for
ward.
i
think
that
the
mayor's
exactly
--
responsibility
is
--
is
greatly
overstated.
it's
true
that
the
statute
says
a
mayor
is
to
report
to
council
on
a
financial
status
of
the
town.
but
as
a
point
of
fact,
the
only
one
who
has
any
idea
at
all
about
what's
going
on
in
town
is
that
there's
a
court
treasurer,
who
is
usually
the
only
full-time
salaried
official
in
the
town
other
than
the
street
department
man
or
the
policeman.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
he
received
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
as
a
footnote,
he
was
right.
the
case
didn't
make
him
any
richer
or
poorer.
he
retired
like
most
of
them
usually
do
after
he
had
enough
of
being
mayor.
it
did
not
lead
on
to
any
great
political
career
and
he
didn't
pick
any
political
or
--
or
financial
claims
during
the
time
he
was
a
mayor.
but
really,
a
small
village
does
not
resemble
the
--
the
federal
government
at
all
in
terms
of
domination
of
the
legislative
by
the
executive
branch.
if
--
if
it'd
be
so
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
it
has
a
population
of
1300,
your
honor.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
huron
county.
and
as
a
point
of
fact,
of
course,
you
can
prove
anything
with
statistics.
it's
true
that
the
village
did
have
traffic
fines
and
made
up
third
to
a
half
of
the
general
fund.
of
course,
the
general
fund
is
only
about
one-fifth
of
the
budget
of
the
village
because
you
have
street
fund,
electric
fund,
water
fund,
sewer
fund.
and
certainly,
all
of
these
other
funds
contribute
to
important
services
to
the
people
in
the
village.
and
so,
it's
a
question
of
--
of
relativity,
it
seems
to
me.
if
you
look
at
the
flow
of
traffic
through
town,
i
think
that
you
recognize
when
you
have
a
heavy
volume
of
traffic,
there
are
more
apt
to
be
convictions
because
there
are
offenses
and
as
through
the
public
utilities
commission,
does
run
these
safety
checks.
so
the
testimony
was
they
ran
about
one
a
month.
now,
that's
hardly,
if
the
village
were
in
the
position
of
wanting
to
make
money,
it
seems
to
me,
they'd
be
asking
to
do
a
lot
more
of
these
safety
checks.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
in
tumey,
you
had
a
very
remarkable
situation
where
the
mayor's
court
had
countywide
jurisdictions,
that
fines
were
in
the
thousands
of
dollars.
the
marshall
kept
15%,
the
prosecuting
attorney
10%,
and
the
special
policeman,
15%
of
the
fines.
they
were
interested
in
the
outcome.
the
mayor
kept
the
cost.
he
was
interested
in
the
outcome
and
in
paying
the
cost
for
this
people
who
are
doing
the
law
enforcement.
and
they're
going
through
a
small
village
under
a
big
city
to
enforce
the
prohibition
law.
but
that
was
set
up
by
the
legislature
separately
because
they
couldn't
get
it
enforced
any
other
way.
now,
today,
in
a
mayor's
court,
this
mayor
has
jurisdiction
only
over
offenses
within
his
own
boundaries,
within
a
municipal
corporation.
and
if
the
fine
is
over
$50,
the
person
has
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury,
which
means
you
go
to
the
county
court
and
then
you
can
waive
the
jury
trial
and
go
ahead
and
have
the
county
court
judge
try
it.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
would
simply
like
to
suggest,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
he
does
have
a
limited
judicial
function
just
as
he
has
a
limited
executive
function,
just
as
he
has
a
limited
legislative
function,
believe
it
or
not.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
he
sure
could.
he
can
be
--
this
man
was
a
truck
driver.
the
mayor
of
monroeville
who
tried
work
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yes.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yes,
he
was,
in
fact.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
in
this
particular
instance,
i
would
say
that
--
that
the
man
was
--
was
partial,
because
of
--
of
a
lot
of
things
that
got
into
newspapers
over
the
sixth-month
waiting
period.
some
of
them,
very
unfavorable
like
this
reference
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
don't
see
why
he
couldn't
be
just
as
impartial
as
a
man
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
can't
say
but
what
--
that
he
could
be
as
impartial
as
--
as
a
lawyer
could
be.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
with
--
within
the
limited
judicial
function
i
think
so.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yes,
he
was,
and
all
i
want
to
--
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
he
does
not
have
--
he
doesn't
have
--
the
mayor
doesn't
have
the
power
to
levy
taxes.
the
mayor
does
have
the
authority
to
appoint
a
policeman,
but
as
was
testified
to
below
and
as
this
was
the
practice,
safety
committee
of
council
goes
to
the
candidates.
they
have
the
mayor
appoint
him
but
the
council
must
approve
the
man,
the
council
must
appropriate
the
money
for
the
salaries,
the
council
must
buy
all
the
equipment
for
the
policeman.
and
it's
up
to
the
village
clerk
to
keep
the
council
informed
as
a
practical
matter
with
respect
to
what
is
going
on
financially
(inaudible)
and
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
take
a
look
at
what
actually
happened
below
that
the
facts
are
susceptible
to
different
interpretations.
now,
this
truck
driver
got
confused.
what
happened
was
he
granted
the
motion
the
first
time
around.
six
months
later,
it
bounced
back.
he
had
a
hearing.
he
started
to
open
the
court
and
council
for
ward
was
interrupting
him,
renewing
the
motion
he
said,
and
the
mayor
says,
“well,
i
can't
grant
it
now.”
then
a
proffer
was
read
into
the
record
and
the
mayor
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing.
i'll
admit
that.
he
then
preceeded
upon
the
end
of
the
proffer
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
ask
ward,
“do
you
have
anything
to
offer
for
a
testimony?”
this
proves,
in
my
estimation,
that
the
man
was
confused,
which
is
unfortunate,
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
mayor
put
some
burden
of
proof
on
defendants
or
at
all,
the
mayor
has
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
defendants.
same
way
with
what
happened
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
mayor
couldn't
see
that
we
were
going
to
end
up
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court.
he
didn't
know
all
the
questions
about
what
--
what
was
the
process
of
--
of
procedure
charging
under
ordinances
or
what
was
going
on
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
the
same
case.
he
thought
they
were
going
up
blind
alleys
wasting
time
and
he
got
mad
and
he
lost
his
temper
and
he
challenged
council
for
ward
and
then
with
respect
to
cross-examining
the
policeman.
i
would
say
that
the
mayor
in
this
case,
did
lose
his
temper.
he
did
act
poorly.
but
i
don't
think
council
for
ward
is
right
to
say
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
man
who's
above
reproach,
but
the
system
put
him
in
this
bad
spot.
i
think
you've
got
a
man
here,
who
listened
to
six
months
of
stuff
in
the
newspapers,
because
this
was
a
very
remarkable
case
for
--
for
a
small
town.
and
the
facts
were
in
the
story
that
it
wasn't
mace
that
was
used,
although
it
was
widely
reported
that
it
was
mace
and
other
facts
were
distorted.
the
mayor
came
with
pretrial
knowledge
that
was
--
was
improper
and
the
mayor
during
the
course
of
the
trial
lawsuits
(inaudible)
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
all
mayors
necessarily
are
--
are
in
the
same
category
as
this
one
mayor
with
respect
to
this
one
--
one
man.
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
--
that
there's
--
there's
no
denying
the
fact
that
this
mayor
did
a
bad
job,
i
think,
in
the
handling
of
this
case.
and
maybe
there
is
--
there
is
argument
there
for
consideration
by
this
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
make
the
leap
in
logic
and
see
that
all
mayors
always
play
some
burden
of
proof
on
defendants,
but
that
they
all
tend
to
defend
policeman
because
they
aren't
responsible
for
the
policeman.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
it
was
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah.
that
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
don't
think
that
that
argument
is
--
is
right.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
case,
i
think
the
system
is
okay.
but
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
they
should
have
filed
an
affidavit
for
prejudice,
based
on
the
facts
of
--
of
the
mayor's
prior
knowledge.
the
mayor
certainly
knew
about
this.
ward
was
arrested
in
monroeville
and
the
mayor
certainly
had
the
kind
of
a
pretrial
knowledge
that
i
think
would
have
been
a
basis
for
a
valid
affidavit
for
--
for
prejudice
for
interest.
he's
certainly
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i,
with
my
limited
experience,
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
was
i
would
presume
it
would
be
tried
by
a
county
court
judge
or
that
--
appointed
for
that
special
purpose
so
they'd
appoint
some
other
civilian.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
there
is
no
provision
in
the
laws,
i
--
as
i
have
read
it
to
say
who
must
then
take
this
spot
of
the
mayor.
i
think
that
--
that
another
question
that's
--
that's
worthy
of
consideration
is
what
will
happen
if
--
if
mayor's
courts
are
abolished.
i
think
that
the
--
the
state
of
ohio
has
indicated
through
the
legislature
they
want
to
keep
them
because
of
the
fact
that
they
do
serve
the
purpose
of
allowing
defendants
to
have
a
--
a
hearing
in
an
evening
before
a
mayor,
not
to
have
to
miss
work
and
go
and
appear
before
a
--
a
magistrate
who
does
--
does
have
court
like
a
municipal
court,
a
county
court
during
the
day.
mayors
are
--
are
part-time
employees
as
far
as
being
mayor's
concern.
they
have
court
session
in
the
evening
because
they
work
during
the
day
time.
in
fact,
you
could
--
you
could
argue
that
more
people
would
be
apt
to
post
bond
and
forfeit
it
rather
than
miss
work
and
appear
before
a
municipal
court
judge
or
county
court
judge.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
if
--
depending
on
the
holding
of
this
court
and
a
change
in
the
state
law
as
you
could,
your
honor,
but
not
under
the
existing
laws.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
was
assuming
that
if
the
mayor's
court
system
per
se
is
held
to
be
unconstitutional
that
people
would
have
to
go
immediately
to
a
county
court
for
relief
in
the
municipal
court.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
depending
on
the
grounds
for
the
holding
of
course.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
believe
it
or
not,
there
are
only
two,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
very
large
county.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
the
court
has
held
in
willard,
ohio
where
i
practice,
a
town
of
about
6,000.
the
other
session
is
in
the
county
seat
norwalk,
ohio,
town
of
about
12,000
or
11,000.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
and
these
judges
hold
court
during
the
day
time.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
this
is
provided
in
state
--
state
law.
they
retain
council
for
a
period
of
up
to
two
years
under
contract
and
i
must
say
that
the
financial
officer
who
knows
what's
going
on
the
village
clerk
more
often
than
not,
goes
to
the
state
auditor's
office
rather
than
come
to
council.
that's
one
of
the
many
bones
of
contention.
but
they
receive
their
advice
from
the
solicitor
when
they
ask
or
from
the
state
auditor,
whomever
prosecute
them,
or
they
consult.
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
--
a
unique
situation.
the
--
the
mayor
presides
also
in
the
sessions
of
council.
the
council
is
where
the
real
power
is
in
the
small
municipality.
they
have
the
power
to
tax.
they
have
the
power
to
spend.
and
the
mayor's
executive
financial
--
executive
responsibility
is
limited.
if
you
look
at
the
executive
power
as
invested
in
the
court
treasurer
or
in
the
marshall,
street
department
and
whoever
else
gets
appointed
in
--
in
small
towns.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
mayor
does
not
run
the
town.
it
is
in
the
executive
office
similar
to
large
cities
or
--
or
similar
to
the
federal
executive.
i
think
that
if
you
review
the
--
the
proceeding
that
actually
went
on
that
it's
susceptible
to
more
than
one
interpretation.
and
i
would
just
respectably
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
whether
--
whether
or
not
the
defendant
fully
availed
himself
of
all
the
rights
that
the
state
law
provided
with
respect
to
trial
de
novo,
which
i
--
i
say
did
exist,
and
with
respect
to
an
affidavit
for
prejudice
based
on
--
on
other
grounds.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
--
the
mayor
does
not
pick
any
great
financial
or
political
fruits
from
being
mayor.
and
the
fact
--
point
of
fact,
i
represent
five
municipalities
between
1,200
and
1,300
and
8,000
of
population
that
have
mayor's
courts.
and
we've
had
12
mayors
in
the
last
four
years.
i've
practiced
law
four
years
and
most,
only
one
was
defeated
for
re-election.
most
of
the
practice,
i
mean
there
are
service
mayors
for
a
couple
of
years
and
quit
because
there
has
one
and
they
pay
for
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
a
year.
they
don't
find
innocent
people
guilty
just
to
get
revenues
for
the
city.
and
--
and
i
guess
in
closing,
what
i'd
like
to
say
is,
i
don't
think
this
case
is
at
all
like
tumey.
and
if
the
court
should
find
though
that
the
--
the
operation
of
the
monroeville
mayor's
court
resembles
tumey,
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
conclude
that
all
mayor's
courts
have
a
high
revenue,
in
the
mayor's
court,
but
that
all
mayors
conduct
themselves
the
way
this
mayor
did.
he
was
provoked.
there
was
six
months
publication
in
magazine
and
newspapers
locally
about
this
particular
event
and
what
had
transpired.
and
i
think
that
i
can't
argue
with
the
--
the
fact
that
the
mayor
acted
improperly
at
some
points
in
the
hearing,
lost
his
temper
and
was
not
the
fair
and
impartial
judicial
officer
he
should
be.
but
i
don't
think
there
are
grounds
for
filing
that
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
that
other
mayors
would
be
like--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
i
think
that
if
the
defendant
had
filed
an
affidavit
for
prejudice
and
had
cited
facts
to
show
the
kind
of
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
think
that
you
can
--
that
if
you
look
at
the
fact
that
the
mayor
lost
his
temper
and
first,
i
think
on
--
on
the
findings
of
fact,
i
think
that
he
made,
as
far
as
the
findings
are
concerned,
i
don't
think
the
outcome
would
have
been
changed
but
that's
not
--
well,
then
i
think
the
mayor
losing
his
temper
acted
as
--
not
as
a
fair
and
impartial
judicial
officer.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
not
from
having
investigated,
in
a
small
town,
when
the
newspaper
picks
up
this
kind
of
events
and
they're
republished
over
six
months.
and
when
newsletters
are
published,
in
some
cases
they
distort
factual
events,
i
think
if
he
comes
to
the
trial
with
a
kind
of
prior
knowledge,
it
isn't
right.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
he
was
not
and
the
mayor
--
the
mayor
is
not
in
charge
of
police.
it
may
say
in
the
statute
that
he's
a
chief
conservator
of
the
peace.
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
the
mayor
does
not
set
schedules
for
policemen
to
work.
he
doesn't
tell
a
policeman
how
to
do
the
job.
the
real
authority
is
the
safety
committee
of
council
who
is
responsible
for
all
expenditures
and
really
responsible
for
the
hiring
of
police.
they
are
the
ones
who
govern
what
the
police
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
the
charges
are
always
brought
by
a
policeman
or
by
people
who
have
witnessed
events.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
suppose
so.
i
--
i
would
presume
that
he
would
have
that
right
if
he
felt
that
the
--
if
the
thing
were
clearly
illegal
and
the
affidavit
was
clearly
improper.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
don't
think
that
the
mayor
--
i
--
i
know
a
little
of
five
times
i
represented,
he
can
and
he
does.
i
don't
think
a
mayor
can
direct
that
charges
could
be
brought.
i
think
that
it's
up
to
the
chief
of
police
to
decide
how
to
enforce
law.
the
only
thing
the
mayor
can
do
is
what
he
did
in
this
case
which
is
to
say,
he
--
he
says
that
if
there's
a
clear-cut
violation,
arrest
people,
and
if
there's
not
a
clear-cut
violation,
forget
it.
and
--
but
i
don't
think
the
mayor
isn't
deeply
involved
in
law
enforcement.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
franklin
eckstein.
i'm
the
solicitor
for
the
village
of
monroeville,
ohio.
i'd
like
to
first
say
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
about
trial
de
novo
and
i'm
just
a
country
lawyer
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
although
i
hesitate
to
differ
with
opposing
counsel,
there
was
a
right
to
trial
de
novo
at
the
time
of
ward's
case.
it
was
in
the
common
pleas
court.
but
ward
did
not
have
the
right
to
a
trial
de
novo
for
the
reason
that
he
had
brought
in
a
court
stenographer.
and
the
rule
then
was
the
same
as
the
rule
as
today
although
you
go
to
the
county
court
or
municipal
court.
that
rule
is,
once
you
bring
in
a
stenographer
and
all
the
evidence
is
reduced
to
a
record,
you
have
the
right
to
appeal
on
questions
of
law,
but
not
on
questions
of
fact.
and
back
then
as
today,
if
you
don't
bring
in
your
stenographer
and
you
go
before
the
mayor,
the
mayor
prepares
his
docket
form
which
is
a
single
piece
of
paper.
no
evidence
or
testimony
other
than
the
mayor's
finding
of
guilty
is
on
that
piece
of
paper
and
you
go
to
the
county
court
or
the
municipal
court
where
you
have
a
complete
new
trier
of
the
facts,
as
well
as
the
law.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
he
could
not
in
his
first
case
because
he
brought
in
a
stenographer
and
what
i'll
call
a
second
case
where
he
did
not
bring
one
in
and
simply
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
that
was
a
fear
to
produce
a
driver's
license.
it
was
related.
we
consolidated
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
that
case,
he
could
have
had
a
trial
de
novo,
if
he
had
chosen,
and
that
would
be
same
rule
of
law
today.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
what
happened
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
the
rule
was
that
if
you
bring
in
a
court
reporter
and
the
testimony
and
the
written
evidence
is
reduced
to
a
writings
when
you
appeal
from
the
mayor's
court,
you
only
get
a
review
of
the
questions
of
law.
you
do
not
get
a
review
of
the
question's
effect.
if
you
leave
the
stenographer
home
which
is
a
tactical
decision,
then
if
you
lose,
you
can
start
all
over
in
the
county
court
or
municipal
court
and
have
a
legislature
who
wanted
to
keep
this
system.
in
1970,
before
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
says,
“now,
the
question
they
asked
us,
would
we
prepare
supplemental
briefs
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
appeal
from
mayor's
court
into
the
common
pleas
court
was
gone
because
of
a
recent
amendment.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
that's
correct.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
but
to
go
back
to
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
this
was
true
then,
and
as
i
say,
i
would
hesitate
to
differ
with
any
interpretation
with
our
practice
in
county
courts
and
municipal
courts
as
well
as
mayor's
courts
in
the
--
in
the
surrounding
communities.
and
this
is
the
practice
where
we
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
it's
the
same.
the
only
difference
was
the
court
you
went
into
on
appeal
because
of
an
amendment
to
(inaudible)
constitution
that
made
that
appear
to
be
doubtful,
whether
you
could
appeal
in
common
pleas
court
the
legislature
not
waiting
on
a
decision
in
our
case
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
amended
that
law.
but
as
recently
as
1970,
they
kept
the
system
although
they
changed
the
court.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
it
was
not
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
the
provisions
if
you
--
they're
--
they're
now,
unfortunately
set
up
(inaudible)
that
if
you
read
the
provisions
as
the
way
it
worked
out
and
that's
in
our
practice,
that's
the
way
it
was.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah,
it's
an
appeal,
mr.
justice
white.
in
other
words,
the
judge
--
the
county
court
judge
would
--
could
have
heard
a
worse
case
than
that;
it
would
have
been
a
common
pleas
judge.
we
would
have
heard
the
evidence
that
wouldn't
have
been,
i
don't
think,
influenced
by
the
fact
that
a
mayor
had
found
the
man
guilty
or
--
or
of
course
if
he
was
not
guilty,
he
wouldn't
be
in
it,
for
the
prosecution.
but
i
don't
think
that
a
county
court
judge
would
have
been
influenced.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
see.
well,
i
presume
that
it
would
be
up
to
him
as
a
reviewing
judge
to
decide
whether
or
not
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
it's
not
a
new
trial.
it's
just
a
review
of
questions
of
law
and
it
would
be
only
a
question
of
evidence.
was
the
judgment
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
in
that
case,
i
think
you
would
have
to.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
not
when
there's
a
transcript.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
none
to
my
knowledge
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
if
he
felt
that
he
would
not
get
a
favorable
decision
in
that
particular
mayor's
court,
he
could
bring
in
a
stenographer
to
preserve
a
record
so
that
he
could
go
to
the
--
to
the
county
court
and
perhaps
--
and
perhaps
did
a
very
minimal
effort
in
terms
of
time,
isn't
just
written
briefs,
perhaps,
could
get
a
reversal.
and
--
but
that
would
be
the
only
real
reason
that
--
that
a
defendant
would
want
to
bring
in
a
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
think
that
that
could
be
a
possible
consideration.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
they
would
not
be
able
to,
and
in
this
case,
the
maximum
fine
would
have
been
$50.
you'd
have
to
follow
the
ordinance
and
there
would
have
been
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
it
would
have
been
tried
to
a
judge.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
not
under
a
higher
law.
he
brought
in
a
stenographer
and
--
and
he
forfeited
that
right
when
he
brought
the
stenographer
in.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
that
has
been
--
that
has
been
merged
into
the
second
offense
and
the
failure
to
ask
for
a
--
a
complete
retrial
for
facts
in
that
case,
in
my
estimation
would
have
waived
the
right.
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
as
we
view
it
in
--
in
the
case
of
mayor's
courts,
an
appeal
would
only
be
where
you
have
the
transcripts
and
the
question
would
be
a
question
to
whether
or
not
the
law
had
been
properly
applied
to
the
facts
as
they
appear
in
the
transcript,
whereas,
trial
de
novo,
as
we
understand
it,
is
a
complete
retrial
as
to
an
introduction
of
evidence
and
everything
else.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
all
i
can
say,
mr.
justice,
is
that
i
believe
that
the
legislature
in
weighing
to
keep
this
court
system
wanted
to
provide
every
protection
they
recently
could
and
still
keep
the
system.
it
is
indeed
a
unique
situation.
but
i'd
like
to
say
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
first
time
that
affidavit
for
--
for
prejudice
was
filed
in
the
monroeville
mayor's
court,
that
the
mayor
granted
the
--
the
motion
of
the
defendant
and
he
did
certify
the
cases
to
the
huron
county
court.
now,
begin
--
from
beginning
to
end,
the
constitutional
question
has
been
raised
and
in
raising
the
--
the
question
on
the
affidavit,
the
mayor
said,
“yes,
you're
right.”
he
certified
the
county
court.
and
the
case
sat
over
there
for
about
four
months
until
december
17,
1968,
when
the
county
court
judge
discovered
the
grounds
for
the
transferal
and
decided
he
did
not
have
original
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
and
sent
it
back
to
mayor
(inaudible)
we
saw
in
the
first
instance,
the
mayor,
i
think,
bent
over
backwards
to
be
fair.
and
unfortunately,
the
county
court
did
not
send
back
the
second
case
involving
the
driver's
license
until
january,
so
that
you
were
not
tried
together
at
the
same
time,
before
mayor
(inaudible)
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
the
point
--
the
point
was,
mr.
justice
that
once
that
the
county
court
judge
returned
the
case
to
him,
he
felt
obligated
to
go
forward
under
--
under
ohio
law.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
the
county
court
did
not
have
original
jurisdiction
in
that
instance
to
--
to
hear
that
case,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
fine
was
less
than
$50,
and
the
basis
for
the
--
the
motion
in
the
county
court
judge's
opinion
was
not
well-taken.
that
was
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
don't
see
how
they
could
have
done
other
than
have
the
--
have
a
substitute
county
court
judge
hear
the
case
because
i
can't
--
i've
--
i've
not
personally
had
that
experience,
but
i
don't
see
how
they
did
appoint
a
mayor
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
--
under
the
system,
i'll
tell
you
that's
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
let's
open
to
question,
possibly
the
president
of
council,
who
assumes
the
role
of
mayor
when
the
mayor
is
out
of
town
or
resigns,
perhaps
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
that's
--
that's
a
question
i
simply
can't
answer,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
my
--
my
suggestion
was
that
he
should
have
based
it
on
other
facts.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
in
this
case,
i
don't
see
how
it
--
how
it
could
have
been
other
than
a
county
court
judge,
but
possibly,
it
could
have
appointed
the
president
of
the
council,
let's
say.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah,
that's
right.
but
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
i'd
like
to
briefly
point
out
that
the
facts
of
life
in
a
small
town
simply
aren't
the
way
that
the
--
that
the
(inaudible)
by
the
council
for
ward.
i
think
that
the
mayor's
exactly
--
responsibility
is
--
is
greatly
overstated.
it's
true
that
the
statute
says
a
mayor
is
to
report
to
council
on
a
financial
status
of
the
town.
but
as
a
point
of
fact,
the
only
one
who
has
any
idea
at
all
about
what's
going
on
in
town
is
that
there's
a
court
treasurer,
who
is
usually
the
only
full-time
salaried
official
in
the
town
other
than
the
street
department
man
or
the
policeman.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
he
received
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
as
a
footnote,
he
was
right.
the
case
didn't
make
him
any
richer
or
poorer.
he
retired
like
most
of
them
usually
do
after
he
had
enough
of
being
mayor.
it
did
not
lead
on
to
any
great
political
career
and
he
didn't
pick
any
political
or
--
or
financial
claims
during
the
time
he
was
a
mayor.
but
really,
a
small
village
does
not
resemble
the
--
the
federal
government
at
all
in
terms
of
domination
of
the
legislative
by
the
executive
branch.
if
--
if
it'd
be
so
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
it
has
a
population
of
1300,
your
honor.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
huron
county.
and
as
a
point
of
fact,
of
course,
you
can
prove
anything
with
statistics.
it's
true
that
the
village
did
have
traffic
fines
and
made
up
third
to
a
half
of
the
general
fund.
of
course,
the
general
fund
is
only
about
one-fifth
of
the
budget
of
the
village
because
you
have
street
fund,
electric
fund,
water
fund,
sewer
fund.
and
certainly,
all
of
these
other
funds
contribute
to
important
services
to
the
people
in
the
village.
and
so,
it's
a
question
of
--
of
relativity,
it
seems
to
me.
if
you
look
at
the
flow
of
traffic
through
town,
i
think
that
you
recognize
when
you
have
a
heavy
volume
of
traffic,
there
are
more
apt
to
be
convictions
because
there
are
offenses
and
as
through
the
public
utilities
commission,
does
run
these
safety
checks.
so
the
testimony
was
they
ran
about
one
a
month.
now,
that's
hardly,
if
the
village
were
in
the
position
of
wanting
to
make
money,
it
seems
to
me,
they'd
be
asking
to
do
a
lot
more
of
these
safety
checks.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
in
tumey,
you
had
a
very
remarkable
situation
where
the
mayor's
court
had
countywide
jurisdictions,
that
fines
were
in
the
thousands
of
dollars.
the
marshall
kept
15%,
the
prosecuting
attorney
10%,
and
the
special
policeman,
15%
of
the
fines.
they
were
interested
in
the
outcome.
the
mayor
kept
the
cost.
he
was
interested
in
the
outcome
and
in
paying
the
cost
for
this
people
who
are
doing
the
law
enforcement.
and
they're
going
through
a
small
village
under
a
big
city
to
enforce
the
prohibition
law.
but
that
was
set
up
by
the
legislature
separately
because
they
couldn't
get
it
enforced
any
other
way.
now,
today,
in
a
mayor's
court,
this
mayor
has
jurisdiction
only
over
offenses
within
his
own
boundaries,
within
a
municipal
corporation.
and
if
the
fine
is
over
$50,
the
person
has
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury,
which
means
you
go
to
the
county
court
and
then
you
can
waive
the
jury
trial
and
go
ahead
and
have
the
county
court
judge
try
it.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
would
simply
like
to
suggest,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
he
does
have
a
limited
judicial
function
just
as
he
has
a
limited
executive
function,
just
as
he
has
a
limited
legislative
function,
believe
it
or
not.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
he
sure
could.
he
can
be
--
this
man
was
a
truck
driver.
the
mayor
of
monroeville
who
tried
work
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yes.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yes,
he
was,
in
fact.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
in
this
particular
instance,
i
would
say
that
--
that
the
man
was
--
was
partial,
because
of
--
of
a
lot
of
things
that
got
into
newspapers
over
the
sixth-month
waiting
period.
some
of
them,
very
unfavorable
like
this
reference
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
don't
see
why
he
couldn't
be
just
as
impartial
as
a
man
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
can't
say
but
what
--
that
he
could
be
as
impartial
as
--
as
a
lawyer
could
be.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
with
--
within
the
limited
judicial
function
i
think
so.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yes,
he
was,
and
all
i
want
to
--
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
he
does
not
have
--
he
doesn't
have
--
the
mayor
doesn't
have
the
power
to
levy
taxes.
the
mayor
does
have
the
authority
to
appoint
a
policeman,
but
as
was
testified
to
below
and
as
this
was
the
practice,
safety
committee
of
council
goes
to
the
candidates.
they
have
the
mayor
appoint
him
but
the
council
must
approve
the
man,
the
council
must
appropriate
the
money
for
the
salaries,
the
council
must
buy
all
the
equipment
for
the
policeman.
and
it's
up
to
the
village
clerk
to
keep
the
council
informed
as
a
practical
matter
with
respect
to
what
is
going
on
financially
(inaudible)
and
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
take
a
look
at
what
actually
happened
below
that
the
facts
are
susceptible
to
different
interpretations.
now,
this
truck
driver
got
confused.
what
happened
was
he
granted
the
motion
the
first
time
around.
six
months
later,
it
bounced
back.
he
had
a
hearing.
he
started
to
open
the
court
and
council
for
ward
was
interrupting
him,
renewing
the
motion
he
said,
and
the
mayor
says,
“well,
i
can't
grant
it
now.”
then
a
proffer
was
read
into
the
record
and
the
mayor
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing.
i'll
admit
that.
he
then
preceeded
upon
the
end
of
the
proffer
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
ask
ward,
“do
you
have
anything
to
offer
for
a
testimony?”
this
proves,
in
my
estimation,
that
the
man
was
confused,
which
is
unfortunate,
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
mayor
put
some
burden
of
proof
on
defendants
or
at
all,
the
mayor
has
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
defendants.
same
way
with
what
happened
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
mayor
couldn't
see
that
we
were
going
to
end
up
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court.
he
didn't
know
all
the
questions
about
what
--
what
was
the
process
of
--
of
procedure
charging
under
ordinances
or
what
was
going
on
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
the
same
case.
he
thought
they
were
going
up
blind
alleys
wasting
time
and
he
got
mad
and
he
lost
his
temper
and
he
challenged
council
for
ward
and
then
with
respect
to
cross-examining
the
policeman.
i
would
say
that
the
mayor
in
this
case,
did
lose
his
temper.
he
did
act
poorly.
but
i
don't
think
council
for
ward
is
right
to
say
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
man
who's
above
reproach,
but
the
system
put
him
in
this
bad
spot.
i
think
you've
got
a
man
here,
who
listened
to
six
months
of
stuff
in
the
newspapers,
because
this
was
a
very
remarkable
case
for
--
for
a
small
town.
and
the
facts
were
in
the
story
that
it
wasn't
mace
that
was
used,
although
it
was
widely
reported
that
it
was
mace
and
other
facts
were
distorted.
the
mayor
came
with
pretrial
knowledge
that
was
--
was
improper
and
the
mayor
during
the
course
of
the
trial
lawsuits
(inaudible)
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
all
mayors
necessarily
are
--
are
in
the
same
category
as
this
one
mayor
with
respect
to
this
one
--
one
man.
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
--
that
there's
--
there's
no
denying
the
fact
that
this
mayor
did
a
bad
job,
i
think,
in
the
handling
of
this
case.
and
maybe
there
is
--
there
is
argument
there
for
consideration
by
this
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
make
the
leap
in
logic
and
see
that
all
mayors
always
play
some
burden
of
proof
on
defendants,
but
that
they
all
tend
to
defend
policeman
because
they
aren't
responsible
for
the
policeman.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
it
was
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
yeah.
that
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
don't
think
that
that
argument
is
--
is
right.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
case,
i
think
the
system
is
okay.
but
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
they
should
have
filed
an
affidavit
for
prejudice,
based
on
the
facts
of
--
of
the
mayor's
prior
knowledge.
the
mayor
certainly
knew
about
this.
ward
was
arrested
in
monroeville
and
the
mayor
certainly
had
the
kind
of
a
pretrial
knowledge
that
i
think
would
have
been
a
basis
for
a
valid
affidavit
for
--
for
prejudice
for
interest.
he's
certainly
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i,
with
my
limited
experience,
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
was
i
would
presume
it
would
be
tried
by
a
county
court
judge
or
that
--
appointed
for
that
special
purpose
so
they'd
appoint
some
other
civilian.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
there
is
no
provision
in
the
laws,
i
--
as
i
have
read
it
to
say
who
must
then
take
this
spot
of
the
mayor.
i
think
that
--
that
another
question
that's
--
that's
worthy
of
consideration
is
what
will
happen
if
--
if
mayor's
courts
are
abolished.
i
think
that
the
--
the
state
of
ohio
has
indicated
through
the
legislature
they
want
to
keep
them
because
of
the
fact
that
they
do
serve
the
purpose
of
allowing
defendants
to
have
a
--
a
hearing
in
an
evening
before
a
mayor,
not
to
have
to
miss
work
and
go
and
appear
before
a
--
a
magistrate
who
does
--
does
have
court
like
a
municipal
court,
a
county
court
during
the
day.
mayors
are
--
are
part-time
employees
as
far
as
being
mayor's
concern.
they
have
court
session
in
the
evening
because
they
work
during
the
day
time.
in
fact,
you
could
--
you
could
argue
that
more
people
would
be
apt
to
post
bond
and
forfeit
it
rather
than
miss
work
and
appear
before
a
municipal
court
judge
or
county
court
judge.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
if
--
depending
on
the
holding
of
this
court
and
a
change
in
the
state
law
as
you
could,
your
honor,
but
not
under
the
existing
laws.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
was
assuming
that
if
the
mayor's
court
system
per
se
is
held
to
be
unconstitutional
that
people
would
have
to
go
immediately
to
a
county
court
for
relief
in
the
municipal
court.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
depending
on
the
grounds
for
the
holding
of
course.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
believe
it
or
not,
there
are
only
two,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
very
large
county.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
the
court
has
held
in
willard,
ohio
where
i
practice,
a
town
of
about
6,000.
the
other
session
is
in
the
county
seat
norwalk,
ohio,
town
of
about
12,000
or
11,000.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
and
these
judges
hold
court
during
the
day
time.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
this
is
provided
in
state
--
state
law.
they
retain
council
for
a
period
of
up
to
two
years
under
contract
and
i
must
say
that
the
financial
officer
who
knows
what's
going
on
the
village
clerk
more
often
than
not,
goes
to
the
state
auditor's
office
rather
than
come
to
council.
that's
one
of
the
many
bones
of
contention.
but
they
receive
their
advice
from
the
solicitor
when
they
ask
or
from
the
state
auditor,
whomever
prosecute
them,
or
they
consult.
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
--
a
unique
situation.
the
--
the
mayor
presides
also
in
the
sessions
of
council.
the
council
is
where
the
real
power
is
in
the
small
municipality.
they
have
the
power
to
tax.
they
have
the
power
to
spend.
and
the
mayor's
executive
financial
--
executive
responsibility
is
limited.
if
you
look
at
the
executive
power
as
invested
in
the
court
treasurer
or
in
the
marshall,
street
department
and
whoever
else
gets
appointed
in
--
in
small
towns.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
mayor
does
not
run
the
town.
it
is
in
the
executive
office
similar
to
large
cities
or
--
or
similar
to
the
federal
executive.
i
think
that
if
you
review
the
--
the
proceeding
that
actually
went
on
that
it's
susceptible
to
more
than
one
interpretation.
and
i
would
just
respectably
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
whether
--
whether
or
not
the
defendant
fully
availed
himself
of
all
the
rights
that
the
state
law
provided
with
respect
to
trial
de
novo,
which
i
--
i
say
did
exist,
and
with
respect
to
an
affidavit
for
prejudice
based
on
--
on
other
grounds.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
--
the
mayor
does
not
pick
any
great
financial
or
political
fruits
from
being
mayor.
and
the
fact
--
point
of
fact,
i
represent
five
municipalities
between
1,200
and
1,300
and
8,000
of
population
that
have
mayor's
courts.
and
we've
had
12
mayors
in
the
last
four
years.
i've
practiced
law
four
years
and
most,
only
one
was
defeated
for
re-election.
most
of
the
practice,
i
mean
there
are
service
mayors
for
a
couple
of
years
and
quit
because
there
has
one
and
they
pay
for
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
a
year.
they
don't
find
innocent
people
guilty
just
to
get
revenues
for
the
city.
and
--
and
i
guess
in
closing,
what
i'd
like
to
say
is,
i
don't
think
this
case
is
at
all
like
tumey.
and
if
the
court
should
find
though
that
the
--
the
operation
of
the
monroeville
mayor's
court
resembles
tumey,
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
conclude
that
all
mayor's
courts
have
a
high
revenue,
in
the
mayor's
court,
but
that
all
mayors
conduct
themselves
the
way
this
mayor
did.
he
was
provoked.
there
was
six
months
publication
in
magazine
and
newspapers
locally
about
this
particular
event
and
what
had
transpired.
and
i
think
that
i
can't
argue
with
the
--
the
fact
that
the
mayor
acted
improperly
at
some
points
in
the
hearing,
lost
his
temper
and
was
not
the
fair
and
impartial
judicial
officer
he
should
be.
but
i
don't
think
there
are
grounds
for
filing
that
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
that
other
mayors
would
be
like--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
i
think
that
if
the
defendant
had
filed
an
affidavit
for
prejudice
and
had
cited
facts
to
show
the
kind
of
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
think
that
you
can
--
that
if
you
look
at
the
fact
that
the
mayor
lost
his
temper
and
first,
i
think
on
--
on
the
findings
of
fact,
i
think
that
he
made,
as
far
as
the
findings
are
concerned,
i
don't
think
the
outcome
would
have
been
changed
but
that's
not
--
well,
then
i
think
the
mayor
losing
his
temper
acted
as
--
not
as
a
fair
and
impartial
judicial
officer.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
not
from
having
investigated,
in
a
small
town,
when
the
newspaper
picks
up
this
kind
of
events
and
they're
republished
over
six
months.
and
when
newsletters
are
published,
in
some
cases
they
distort
factual
events,
i
think
if
he
comes
to
the
trial
with
a
kind
of
prior
knowledge,
it
isn't
right.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
no,
he
was
not
and
the
mayor
--
the
mayor
is
not
in
charge
of
police.
it
may
say
in
the
statute
that
he's
a
chief
conservator
of
the
peace.
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
the
mayor
does
not
set
schedules
for
policemen
to
work.
he
doesn't
tell
a
policeman
how
to
do
the
job.
the
real
authority
is
the
safety
committee
of
council
who
is
responsible
for
all
expenditures
and
really
responsible
for
the
hiring
of
police.
they
are
the
ones
who
govern
what
the
police
--
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
the
charges
are
always
brought
by
a
policeman
or
by
people
who
have
witnessed
events.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
well,
i
suppose
so.
i
--
i
would
presume
that
he
would
have
that
right
if
he
felt
that
the
--
if
the
thing
were
clearly
illegal
and
the
affidavit
was
clearly
improper.
mr.
franklin
d.
eckstein
i
don't
think
that
the
mayor
--
i
--
i
know
a
little
of
five
times
i
represented,
he
can
and
he
does.
i
don't
think
a
mayor
can
direct
that
charges
could
be
brought.
i
think
that
it's
up
to
the
chief
of
police
to
decide
how
to
enforce
law.
the
only
thing
the
mayor
can
do
is
what
he
did
in
this
case
which
is
to
say,
he
--
he
says
that
if
there's
a
clear-cut
violation,
arrest
people,
and
if
there's
not
a
clear-cut
violation,
forget
it.
and
--
but
i
don't
think
the
mayor
isn't
deeply
involved
in
law
enforcement.
