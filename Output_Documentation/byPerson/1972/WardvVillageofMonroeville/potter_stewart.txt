justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
what
the
mayor's
salary
was?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
the
salary
is
a
matter
of
a
local
decision
as
it
is
not
determined
by
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it'd
probably
be
to
the
few
hundred
dollars
in
a
village
like
this
one.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
-
it
could
be
the
county
court?
justice
potter
stewart
--
were
created
back
in
the
‘50s
right?
justice
potter
stewart
abolition
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
and
would
there
be
a
municipal
court
with
jurisdiction
over
monroeville?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
while
i
interrupted
you,
may
i
ask
if
i'm
right
in
my
understanding
that
this
is
a
--
this
system
is
not
in
anyway
peculiar
to
monroeville,
ohio
but
it
would
be
as
a
situation
to
be
found
in
all
of
the
non-chartered,
incorporated
villages
throughout
the
state,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
hundreds
of
such
villages.
justice
potter
stewart
but
again,
their
--
their
power
to
punish
is
limited
even
for
a
violation
of
those
state
laws,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
well,
a
limited
power
to
punish.
isn't
it
true?
justice
potter
stewart
should
a
village
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
fine
somebody
for
manslaughter?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
longer
i
got
it
from
what
you
said
earlier
that
the
mayor
gets
paid
part
of
his
compensation
from
the
fines.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
--
all
members
of
the
council
there
have
shared
the
responsibility
for
financing
the
municipality.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
way.
but
you
should
not
prevail
here.
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
there
is
no
transcript
in
this
record?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that's
true
also
now
since
1970?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
change
in
the
law
in
1970
but
you
say
--
and
this
reflects
us
that
the
law
is
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
so
while
the
--
while
the
1970
law
does
talk
about
a
trial
de
novo,
you
are
telling
us
that
when
in
fact
you
had
a
stenographer
in
the
mayor's
court,
it
may
not
be
a
trial
de
novo.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
--
even
though
the
legislature
is
calling
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
might
be
another
reason
again
to
the
argument
we
heard
earlier
today
in
this
antitrust
case
just
the
presence
of
the
stenographer
might
lead
to
a
fairer
trial
by
the
mayor,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
is
the
basis
--
were
a
valid
basis
i.e.,
let's
just
say
that
there
was
a
personal
prejudice
part
of
the
mayor.
then
--
then
what
--
what
substitute
judge
would
he
have
had,
the
mayor
of
another
town
or
the
county
judge
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
clear
under
the
ohio
law.
justice
potter
stewart
but
because
you
suggest
in
your
brief
that
he
could
have
filed
then.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right,
but
if
he
had,
and
if
that
had
been
valid,
now
my
question
is,
“what
would
have
happened?”
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
know
the
answer.
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
in
this
case,
the
county
court
judge
probably
said,
“i
have
no
jurisdiction
of
this
case,
even
though
the
mayor
had
disqualified
himself.”
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
mayor,
you're
telling
us,
gets
no
salary
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
what
the
population
of
monroeville
village?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
on
huron
county.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
he
was
elected
by
the
voters
of
monroeville,
wasn't
--
was
he
not
to
this
period?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
--
i
don't
understand,
mr.
berkman,
to
be
making
that
argument.
in
fact,
i
rather
understood
him
be
emphasizing
that
his
attack
is
upon
the
system
as
such.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
know,
i
think
that
the
system
may
in
some
cases
grant
very,
very
fair
trials.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
cases,
unfair
trials
but
that
the
system
itself
is
constitutionally
invalid.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
you
can't
tell
us
what,
under
the
law
of
ohio
would
have
happened,
if
the
mayor
had
said,
“yes,
you're
right
i
am
prejudiced.
i'm
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
know
that
the
law
is
not
clear,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
county
judges
are
there
in
huron
county?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
know.
it
is
--
does
either
one
of
them
live
in
monroeville,
hold
court
in
monroeville?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
day
time
sessions?
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
at
all
at
night?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
facts
were
quite
different
with
respect
to
in
his
salary
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
any
--
do
have
any
knowledge,
mr.
berkman,
as
to
how
wide
and
how
great
an
impact
a
decision
in
your
favor
in
this
case
would
have,
in
other
words,
of
how
many
states
are
--
exists
or
a
similar
system
exists?
justice
potter
stewart
giving
judicial
power
to
the
mayor
of
a

justice
