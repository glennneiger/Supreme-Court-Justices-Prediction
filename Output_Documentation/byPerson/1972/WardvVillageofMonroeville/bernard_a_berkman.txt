mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
squarely,
the
question
of
the
continuing
vitality
of
the
mayor's
court
system
and
a
dispensation
of
roadside
justice
in
ohio.
specifically,
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
mayor
charged
with
the
financial
and
law
enforcement
responsibilities
for
the
village
of
which
he
is
executive
and
the
administrative
head
can
serve
as
an
impartial
judge
and
fact
finder
in
criminal
proceedings
without
violating
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
issue
are
briefly
stated.
actually,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
couple
of
traffic
offenses
in
the
mayor's
court
in
monroeville.
he
was
convicted
of
offenses
which
are
violations
of
ordinances
of
that
incorporated
village.
monroeville
is
a
small,
uncharted,
incorporated
village
in
north
western,
ohio
and
huron
county
through
which
a
main
truck
in
auto
highways
state
route
20
rise.
it
carries
a
considerable
amount
of
truck
traffic
and
from
time
to
time,
public
utilities
commission
state
officials
conduct
safety
checks
at
its
village
boundaries
in
cooperation
with
village
constables.
and
the
record
reveals
that
in
some
instances
when
these
safety
checks
occur
up
to
20
arrests
per
day,
happen.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
failure
to
comply
with
a
lawful
order
of
the
police
in
and
which
it
was
contended
that
he
did
not
stop
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
after
having
been
waived
down
in
order
to
participate
in
one
of
these
puc
traffic
checks.
and
secondly,
he
was
charged
with
failure
to
produce
a
driver's
license
upon
request
of
a
police
officer
in
an
altercation,
which
occurred
after
he
did
stop
his
truck
somewhat
at
the
road
during
which
an
episode
of
shooting
of
mace
and
so
on
occurred.
petitioner
was
tried.
he
interposed
the
defense.
he
was
convicted
and
fined
the
maximum
of
$50
cost
in
each
case.
the
constitutional
question
which
is
here
presented
was
preserved
by
affidavit
to
disqualify
the
mayor
as
judge,
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
or
any
alternative
to
certify
to
a
proper
court.
in
all
of
these
instances,
the
petitioner
was
frustrated
and
a
number
of
it
has
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
trials
and
both
trials
ultimately
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
consolidated
so
that
they
are
here
presented.
a
number
of
rather
aberrant
episodes
occurred
during
which
the
mayor
sought
to
shift
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
accused,
a
period
that
somewhat
surprised
and
amazed
the
defense
council
would
even
challenge
the
credibility
of
a
uniformed
officer
under
oath,
abandoned
to
the
police
officer
witness
the
right
to
determine
whether
he
need
to
answer
questions
put
to
him
by
defense
council.
and
as
a
layman,
not
a
lawyer
relied
rather
substantially
and
heavily
upon
the
prosecutor's
legal
advice.
at
a
hearing
conducted
on
the
affidavit
to
disqualify,
some
additional
information
of
relevance
and
importance
to
the
constitutional
question
here
presented
emerged.
it
was
demonstrated
that
from
the
years
1964
through
1968,
the
five
previous
years,
prior
to
the
conviction
that
of
the
total
number
of
--
total
amount
of
money
in
the
village's
general
funds.
in
each
year
somewhere
between
36%
and
51%
of
all
of
the
general
revenues
of
the
village
came
from
fines
assessed
in
the
mayor's
court.
in
addition,
it
appeared
in
1959,
at
the
time
when
the
village
was
concerned
that
the
jurisdiction
of
mayor's
courts
was
to
be
less
the
alarm
that
the
village
had
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
lessening
of
jurisdiction
of
mayor's
courts
would
somehow
rather
affect
adversely
its
physical
position
is
demonstrated
by
a
village
ordinance
59-9
in
1959
in
which
an
expert
was
hired
in,
at
least
partially,
in
concern
over
the
fact
that
the
decrease
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mayor's
courts
would
involve
some
increased
tax
responsibilities
are
curtailed
services
for
the
members
of
the
village.
that
ordinance
is
reproduced
in
our
brief
and
also
appears
in
the
--
in
the
appendix.
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
as
a
part
of
the
hearings,
a
number
of
other
important
constitutional
facts
were
developed
in
the
case
below.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
established
in
the
law
of
ohio's
clearance,
i
think,
that
the
mayor
is
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
village
with
the
power
to
hire,
fire,
and
supervise
the
police
chief
and
all
the
members
of
the
--
of
the
police
force.
he
has
the
--
he
has
the
power
as
the
sheriff
and
is
to
enforce
the
--
the
piece
in
the
--
within
its
boundaries.
and
in
this
instance,
he
was
--
he
had
the
power
to
do
and
actually
did
appoint
--
the
police
chief
who
was
the
principal
witness
against
the
accused
in
this
case
and
had,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
determine
the
credibility
of
his
employee.
it
is
true
that
there
is
some
approval
required
of
council
in
this
instance.
but
the
--
the
principal
responsibility
in
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
i
think
without
question
is
the
mayor
who
sits
as
the
judge
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
the
ohio
revised
code
section
73715,
18,
73330
and
190520
made
very
clear
his
position
as
chief
law
enforcement
officer
in
the
village.
in
addition,
it
was
developed
and
the
law
is
also
clear
that
the
mayor
is
the
chief
executive
of
the
village
with
financial
responsibility
for
its
physical
condition.
he
is
required
to
report
his
physical
condition
in
the
event
that
there
were
excess
expenditures
or
expenditures
which
are
improper,
he
is
required
to
enforce
it
and
ohio
revised
code
section
73332
and
73333
make
that
abundantly
clear.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
it
does
not.
we
do
not
contend
that
his
salary
was
dependent
upon
the
--
the
outcome
of
a
particular
case
except
that
it
--
it
is
demonstrated
and
it
was
taken
from
the
general
fund.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
would
imagine.
it
was
also
developed
that
the
mayor
is
not
a
lawyer,
not
subject
to
the
canons
of
judicial
ethics
and
yet
required
by
law
to
make
procedural
and
evidentiary
rulings
under
ohio
revised
code
section
293815.
and
that,
inasmuch,
as
he
was
not
a
lawyer,
the
person
from
whom
he
sought
his
legal
advice
was
the
village
solicitor
who
happened
to
be
the
prosecutor
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
you're
quite
right.
i
think
that
that
in
itself
would
not
be
an
unusual
fact.
our
contention
was
that
coupled
with
all
of
the
other
factors
which
keep
the
--
the
tribunal
from
seeing
the
--
the
situation
in
a
neutral
manner,
add
to
the
situation
which
he
is
obtaining
all
of
his
information,
including
matters
of
admissibility
of
evidence
and
so
on
from
a
--
a
source
which
is
biased
in
one
direction
of
the
case.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that
is
not
our
--
our
particular
consideration.
as
a
matter
of
a
fact,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
entire
composite
of
circumstances
under
the
statutory
scheme
which
has
established
mayor's
courts
has
both
executives
in
charge
of
the
functions
of
their
village
and
also
to
see
it
as
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
in
--
in
criminal
manners,
is
in
itself
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
all
of
these
factors
add
together
to
create
the
constitutional
infirmity
of
which
we
complain.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
that
it
is
now
clear
that
under
the
1970
amendments
at
least
which
followed
the
--
the
case
as
it
was
tried
initially,
by
some
two
years,
now
that
there
is
under
section
1905
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the
county
court's
appeal
was
a
matter
of
law,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
additional
skirmish
or
issue
taken
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
and
at
the
supreme
court
level.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
think
that
it
would
not
make
any
difference
because
of
the
fact
that
we
contend
that
it
is
not
necessary
or
condition
to
proceed
to
go
through
an
unconstitutional
trial
in
order
to
get
a
constitutional
one.
our
--
our
position
is
that
they
have
to
go
through
two
--
two
trials
before
you
get
the
minimal
amount
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
stretch
that
far,
mr.
justice
white,
because
so
far
as
we
are
concerned,
at
least
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
the
bare
minimal
amount
of
due
process,
and
we
know
that
in
different
kinds
of
circumstances,
this
court
has
applied
different
standards
of
--
of
due
process.
but
we
say
this,
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
regardless
of
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
entitled
--
entitled
to
--
to
counsel.
regardless
of
whether
he's
entitled
to
have
witnesses
and
all
of
the
other
aspects
that
get
together
in
due
process,
we
think
that
at
the
very
minimum,
even
in
traffic
offenses,
even
in
petty
matters,
that
an
impartial
tribunal,
unquestioned
as
a
result
because
of
his
--
his
role
in
other
matters
is
a
basic
exemption.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
in
this
case,
the
maximum
was
imposed.
it
was
$50.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
could
not
because
under
--
under
the
--
the
rule,
if
the
fine
exceeds
$50,
then
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
individual
who
is
on
trial
is
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
court
of
record
in
as
much
as
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
right.
and
so
we
were
not
so
entitled.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
--
the
court
said
they
have
current
jurisdiction
which
are
courts
of
record
in
ohio
municipal
court
and
the
county
court
set
up
incidentally
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
back
in
1957,
as
a
result
of
the
--
the
legislative
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
abolition
of
the
justice
of
peace
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
not,
but
the
county
courts
have
jurisdiction
where
--
where
the
municipal
courts
do
not.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
it
is
set
out
in
section
1905,
chapter
1905
of
the
ohio
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
--
and
there,
i
would
imagine,
hundreds
of
--
of
such
mayoral
courts.
their
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
--
to
consideration
of
criminal
cases
under
their
village
ordinances
and
moving
traffic
violations
that
occur
within
their
border.
so
that
in
fact,
they
also
had
jurisdiction
over
state
statutory
violations
involving
moving
vehicular
traffic.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
to
the
extent
that
the
accused
actually
has
a
right
to
and
seeks
a
jury
trial.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
a
number
of
tactical
and
financial
reasons
why
somebody
would
decide
that
he
ought
not
to
have
a
jury
trial.
and
in
those
instances,
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
such
cases.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
i
--
i
find
those
such
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
--
no
such
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
find
no
such
statutory
limitation
and
desire
contention
that
traffic
manslaughter
is
indeed
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
if
the
accused
does
not
signature
a
trial.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
he
can.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
section
1905.30
specifically
indicates
that
particularly
in
the
event
of
--
of
the
non-payment
of
a
fine
that
the
individuals
to
be
incarcerated.
and
that
is
--
that
appears
specifically
in
the
statute.
as
i
read
its
jurisdiction,
i
think
that
traffic
manslaughter,
driving
while
intoxicated,
all
of
which
carry
penalties
including
imprisonment
would
be
within
the
court's
jurisdiction,
subject
only
to
the
provision
that
if
an
individual
seeks
a
jury
trial,
he
can
have
it
somewhere
else
and
that
is
in
the
court
of
record.
the
due
process
issue
was
preserved
at
each
level
of
appeal
and
the
hearing
county
court
of
appeals
consolidated
both
cases
and
affirmed
the
convictions
and
the
supreme
court
by
a
five-to-two
decision
and
ohio
did
the
same.
certiorari
was
granted
and
the
issue
is
now
before
us.
i
think
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
belabor
the
point
that
a
neutral,
detached,
impartial
judge
and
fact
finder
is
essential
to
minimum
standards
of
due
process
in
fair
hearings,
both
in
criminal
and
non-criminal
cases.
i
would
only
point
out
that
an
impartial
judge
as
a
requirement
of
fair
hearings
is
as
old
as
the
history
of
courts,
as
old
as
the
judicial
process
itself.
the
whole
point
it
seems
to
me,
of
letting
somebody
have
the
power
to
adjudicate
a
decision
between
two
competing
parties,
is
the
hope
that
the
judge
will
act
in
a
way
which
goes
straight
down
the
middle
and
be
neutral
and
determine
the
result
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
and
not
on
the
basis
of
his
own
self-interest.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
judges
appointed
by
the
mayor,
i
think
that
it
might
not
violate
due
process
under
such
circumstances
so
long
as
the
judge
takes
a
note
and
--
and
performs
as
--
as
officer.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
we
might
run
into
a
question
depending
upon
the
entire
aggregate
of
circumstances
under
those
concerned.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yeah,
it
seems
to
us
that
we
are
asking
too
much.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
--
we
think
that
he's
asking
too
much
of
a
system
and
too
much
of
an
individual
under
the
intertwined
system
in
--
in
which
he
must
wear
the
hat
of
a
policeman
and
the
hat
of
the
impartial
judge
and
the
hat
of
the
administrator
of
--
of
the
village
to
give,
not
only
justice,
but
the
appearance
of
justice
to
which
we
think
that
every
motorist
and
every
individual
comes
within
the
jurisdiction
that
the
court
is
entitled.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
situation
has
changed,
insofar
as
the
statutes
are
concerned
with
respect
to
tumey,
and
since
that
time
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
mayor's
court
has
been
whittled
away
so
that
it
no
longer
involves
countywide
jurisdiction
as
i've
indicated
in
response
and
answer
to
that.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
right.
those
--
those
are
two
distinctions
and
the
fact
that
we
present
to
you
now
as
--
as
distinguished
from
tumey.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
we
think
it
is
less
like
dugan
than
it
is
like
tumey.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
that
--
that
dugan
is
not
applicable
at
all
because
--
because
the
dugan
case
involved
a
--
a
chartered
municipality
and
a
commission
form
of
government
in
which
it
was
conceded
and
stipulated
by
all
of
the
parties,
that
the
person
designated,
the
mayor,
in
that
case,
was
not
the
chief
executive
officer
as
the
mayor
is
in
this
case.
and
that
really,
all
he
was,
was
a
member
of
the
--
a
commission
of
five
persons.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
--
that
he
was
not,
in
anyway,
involved
in
the
executive
operation
of
the
--
of
the
city.
really
that
--
that
executive
responsibility
was
posited
in
the
--
in
the
city
manager.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
he
was
but
the
actual
administrative
or
executive
function
was
confined
in
the
hands
of
the
city
manager
rather
than
the
commission
itself.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
--
that
the
individual
role
of
the
person
who
sat
as
a
mayor
was
subject
to
at
least
the
checks
and
balances
that
the
chartered
system
gave
under
those
circumstances.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
great
deal
of
time
and
attention
in
that
opinion,
a
short
one,
was
devoted
to
the
distinction
between
--
between
the
chartered
system
and
the
mayoral
system
which
--
which
we
had
in
tumey
and
which
appears
presently
before
this
court.
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
only
in
addition
to
tumey
and
dugan
which
--
which
are
at
the
--
at
the
core
of
this
court's
concerns
in
this
case.
in
re
murchison,
which,
i
think,
finishes
the
job
that
was
began
in
tumey,
to
indicate
that
the
appearance
as
well
as
the
actual
form
of
justice
has
got
to
appear.
now,
in
order
to
excuse
the
kind
of
--
of
system
that
we
have
had
in
ohio,
some
arguments
have
been
made
by
the
respondent.
some
arguments
have
been
made
by
legislators
and
i
think
that
there
are
basically
three.
the
first
is
that
this
is
de
minimis
and
that
the
kind
of
damage
that
can
be
done
to
an
accused
in
this
kind
of
court
is
something
that
really
ought
to
be
overlooked,
in
the
interest
of
the
expediency
of
--
of
operating
a
court
and
so
on.
it
is
the
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
--
we
think
that
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
has
been
an
indication
that
that
is
not
an
argument
that
is
--
that
is
necessary
to
deal
with
and
if
the
court
fields
that
we
ought
not,
we
will
move
on
to
our
next
contention,
which
is
--
which
is
a
contention
that
is
made,
that
with
respect
to
the
infliction
of
substantial,
that
no
substantial
damage
can
be
inflicted.
in
response
to
question
from
mr.
justice
stewart,
i've
indicated
that
there
are
grave
consequences.
but
i'd
like
to
add
one
more
to
that,
which
has
not
been
brought
out
and
that
is
that
under
ohio's
point
system
for
the
accumulation
of
points
to
revoke
a
driver's
license,
ohio
revised
code
section
4507.40.
twelve
points
are
necessary
to
take
away
a
driver's
license.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
truck
driver.
he
drives
a
truck
for
a
living.
the
events
of
which
he
was
convicted
under
the
list
of
points
per
violation
that
appear
in
that
statute
would
take
--
would
give
him
six
points.
and
a
mayor's
court,
although
there's
not
a
court
of
record,
for
purposes
of
giving
reports
to
the
bureau
of
motor
vehicles
on
--
in
ohio,
is
indeed
a
court
of
record
for
at
least
that
limited
purpose.
and
so,
as
a
result
of
this
conviction,
half
of
the
necessary
points
to
take
away
his
driver's
license
in
this
court
occurred.
bell
against
burson,
your
case
and
forward
to
u.s.,
i
think
indicates
the
importance
particularly
to
a
--
a
wager
around
the
road
of
having
his
driver's
license.
and
we
would
have
that
point.
i
think
we
have
dealt
with
our
contention
in
response
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
white
with
respect
to
the
appeal
de
novo.
but
i
would
only
add
that
the
appeal
de
novo
is
a
rather
peculiar
animal
in
ohio
and
the
one
that
you
will
be
considering
in
this
case
has
within
it,
a
couple
of
contradictions
that
caused
me
concern
to
think
that
maybe
it
isn't
a
fresh
slate
upon
which
is
written
in
the
new
trial.
our
answer
would
stand
that
we
think
that
you
don't
have
to
have
two
trials
in
order
to
get
one
that's
constitutional.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
another
question
which
i
don't
understand
the
answer
to.
particularly,
i
view
the
fact
that
during
the
course
of
our
appeal
that
new
right
in
our
contention
was
made
available
to
us.
but
i
will
only
urge
that
even
under
the
present
--
the
present
statutory
law,
the
section
1905.30
provides
for
incarceration
and
or
bond.
and
also,
the
1905.24
very
curiously
provides
that
the
appeal,
even
the
appeal
de
novo
which
is
referred
to
in
--
in
the
next
section
cannot
be
even
docketed
unless
a
transcript
to
the
proceedings
below
is
presented
to
the
court.
and
i
ask
for
what
purpose
if
this
is
a
de
novo
hearing.
is
a
transcript
necessary
to
be
prepared
and
how
is
that
to
be
used
either
to
influence
the
court
above
or
to
be
used
as
a
judicial
admission
in
the
taking
of
testimony
or
there
is
no
transcript.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
refer,
the
court
respectfully,
to
read
the
section
1905.24
which
makes
that
a
condition
proceeding
to
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
there
isn't
except
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
it
isn't
the
court
of
record.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
presume
that
--
that
the
parties
can
make
private
arrangement,
but
there
is
no
statutory
arrangement
for
a
statute.
and
i
point
out
only
the
difficulties
in
application
of
the
de
novo
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
practice
i
--
the
practice
i
believe
is
--
is
that
there
--
there
is
ordinarily,
the
practice
is
that
there
is
no
appeal
from
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i'm
sorry.
this
is
the
only
appeal
from
that
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
it
is
new
since
june
of
1970.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
because
the
original
papers
are
also
referred
to,
your
honor,
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure.
it
is
unclear.
also,
the
word
“trial”
as
used
in
that
--
in
that
statute,
and
i
only
suggest
that
merely
calling
something
de
novo
does
not
solve
all
of
the
problems
that
--
that
may
emerge
in
dealing
with
the
question,
and
it's
new.
an
argument
is
also
made
that
the
provisions
of
ohio
revised
code
section
2937.20,
which
provide
for
disqualification
for
bias
is
a
protection
against
excesses
in
the
mayor's
court.
and
we
tried
that
in
this
case,
and
i
--
i'm
here
to
report
to
you
that
it
didn't
work
successfully
unless
you
--
you
feel
that
--
that
at
every
$50-fine
needs
to
come
to
this
court
in
order
to
have
--
to
have
ultimate
adjudication.
what
we
are
saying
basically
is
that
there's
a
difference
between
individual
bias
and
systemic
interest.
and
we
are
saying
that
this
particular
statute
is
designed
to
deal
with
the
mayor
who
happens
to
be
the
brother-in-law
of
an
opposing
party
or
something
to
that
kind,
but
does
not
deal
with
the
inherent
systemic
problems
and
therefore
cannot
be
handled
in
every
case
in
a
way
which
--
which
permits
that
kind
of
--
of
disqualification.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
comments,
i
--
the
fact
that
the
judge
in
this
case
was
a
truck
driver
and
the
defendant
was
a
truck
driver,
i
think
is
not
the
kind
of
trial
by
what
appears
is
that
was
--
was
intended.
i
--
i
would
only
say
that
i
--
i
misspoke
in
my
principal
argument
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
word
“mace.”
the
record
specifically
says
tear
gas
and
i
would
--
i
think
there's
no
constitutional
difference.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
there
was
apparently
an
altercation
after
the
--
the
attempt
by
the
village
constable
to
flag
down
the
accused.
this
occurred
at
a
parking
lot
near
a
restaurant,
some
1,700
feet
beyond
the
point
at
which
the
individual
is
flagged
down.
his
defense
was
that
he
had
a
loaded
truck
and
that
he
could
not
stop
immediately
and
that
it
was
not
safe
to
stop
his
truck
there
and
he
pulled
into
the
first
location
off
the
berm
where
his
truck
could
reasonably
stop.
at
that
point,
the
village
constable
now
the
--
or
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
the
--
the
chief
of
police
of
the
city
took
chase
in
his
automobile,
an
altercation
took
place
there,
during
which
time
--
during
which
time
mr.
ward
was
hit
with
--
with
tear
gas
from
the
police
officer's
cannister.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
mayor
was
not
there
at
that
time.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no.
i
would
point
out
a
--
a
couple
things
that
this
court
has
a
rare
opportunity
to
determine
for
itself,
what,
or
i
should
say
that,
has
a
rare
opportunity
because
it
has
already
been
determined
whether
or
not
the
financial
responsibilities
of
the
mayor
are
such
that
they
involved
him
in
that
kind
of
activity.
in
tumey,
the
very
same
statutes
that
we
have
here
with
respect
to
the
mayor's
responsibility
were
considered
and
the
court
shall
find.
their
numbers
have
been
changed
with
the
renumbering
system
but
this
--
the
language
i
have
checked
and
it
is
identical
with
respect
to
the
responsibility
that
the
mayor
has
for
the
financial
affairs
in
the
city.
and
the
court's
specific
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
i'm
only
talking
about
those
particular
aspects
of
his
financial
responsibility,
which
were
an
issue
here.
i
would
also
urge
with
respect
to
the
necessary
neutrality,
necessary
detachment
which
is
required
although
we
have
not
taken
a
position
that
--
that
separation
of
powers
is
compelled
against
the
state.
we
--
we
do
say
that
this
court
has
drawn
a
line
between
judiciary
action
and
police
action,
at
least,
in
certain
areas.
and
we
have
called
the
court's
attention
in
our
brief,
the
coolidge
against
new
hampshire,
in
which
one
of
the
principle
points
dealt
with
the
importance
of
a
neutral
and
detached
judicial
officer
required
to
issue
a
warrant.
and
in
shadwick
against
tampa,
last
term,
in
407
u.s.,
this
court
in
distinguishing,
are
between
whether
or
not
a
clerk
could
issue
an
arrest
warrant,
made
it
very
clear
that
neutrality
and
detachment
of
the
judicial
officer
requires
severance
and
disengagement
from
activities
of
law
enforcement.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
easy
move
from
the
issuance
of
warrants
to
a
situation
where
a
--
a
determination
is
not
being
made
of
the
threshold
issue
of
probable
cause,
but
really
the
ultimate
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
how
much
more
important
is
it
to
make
sure
that
the
judicial
and
the
police
officers
are
not
intertwined
in
that
way?
we
would
urge
that
in
the
event
that
mayor's
courts
should
be
abolished
or
the
statutory
provision,
dealing
with
them
should
be
dealt
with
appropriately
by
this
court.
no
great
inconvenience
would
occur.
we
are
ready
to
stipulate
that
some
way
could
be
found
in
order
to
take
bond
forfeitures
and
pleas
of
guilty.
our
contention
is
that
when
you
have
a
dispute
that
court
is
of
no
use,
if
we
are
going
to
concern
ourselves
with
minimal
standards
of
due
process.
we
think
that
the
county
courts
which
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
are
available
and
can
set
up
some
kind
of
a
night
procedure
or
some
kind
of
a
procedure
for
bond
forfeitures
and
so
on
to
--
to
adapt
to
the
convenience
of
the
--
of
the
population.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
oh
no.
i
--
i'm
only
responding
to
the
policy
suggestion
that
there
might
be
some
difficultly
if
this
court
did
its
constitutional
duty
and
struck
down
this
court.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
are
saying
that
there
are
a
couple
of
alternatives,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
is
that
it
might
go
to
the
county
court
or
it
might
do
as
it
has
done
in
1957
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
--
in
tumey
in
striking
down
the
justice
of
the
peace
courts,
who
were
paid
on
the
fee
system
decried
by
the
court
in
tumey.
it
set
up
an
entirely
new
court
system
in
order
to
handle
the
traffic
of
problem
and
that's
not
the
county
courts
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
pardon?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
sometimes,
the
decisions
of
this
court
reach
ohio
slowly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
i
think
that's
an
example.
but
they
cited
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
history
that
this
was
the
reason
for
doing
it.
you
have
it
there
sometime
like
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
in
our
brief,
we
have
listed
in
one
of
the
footnotes
approximately
13
to
14
other
states
which
have
this
kind
of
--
of
system.
i
think
they're
probably
are
less
now,
and
their
number
is
dwindling.
there
was
a
time,
i
think,
when
some
40
states
had
some
--
something
similar.
they're
not
all
identical,
of
course,
but
something
similar.
i
think
there
are
now
some
13
states
which
we've
listed
in
our
brief
which
do
have
some
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
squarely,
the
question
of
the
continuing
vitality
of
the
mayor's
court
system
and
a
dispensation
of
roadside
justice
in
ohio.
specifically,
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
mayor
charged
with
the
financial
and
law
enforcement
responsibilities
for
the
village
of
which
he
is
executive
and
the
administrative
head
can
serve
as
an
impartial
judge
and
fact
finder
in
criminal
proceedings
without
violating
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
issue
are
briefly
stated.
actually,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
couple
of
traffic
offenses
in
the
mayor's
court
in
monroeville.
he
was
convicted
of
offenses
which
are
violations
of
ordinances
of
that
incorporated
village.
monroeville
is
a
small,
uncharted,
incorporated
village
in
north
western,
ohio
and
huron
county
through
which
a
main
truck
in
auto
highways
state
route
20
rise.
it
carries
a
considerable
amount
of
truck
traffic
and
from
time
to
time,
public
utilities
commission
state
officials
conduct
safety
checks
at
its
village
boundaries
in
cooperation
with
village
constables.
and
the
record
reveals
that
in
some
instances
when
these
safety
checks
occur
up
to
20
arrests
per
day,
happen.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
failure
to
comply
with
a
lawful
order
of
the
police
in
and
which
it
was
contended
that
he
did
not
stop
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
after
having
been
waived
down
in
order
to
participate
in
one
of
these
puc
traffic
checks.
and
secondly,
he
was
charged
with
failure
to
produce
a
driver's
license
upon
request
of
a
police
officer
in
an
altercation,
which
occurred
after
he
did
stop
his
truck
somewhat
at
the
road
during
which
an
episode
of
shooting
of
mace
and
so
on
occurred.
petitioner
was
tried.
he
interposed
the
defense.
he
was
convicted
and
fined
the
maximum
of
$50
cost
in
each
case.
the
constitutional
question
which
is
here
presented
was
preserved
by
affidavit
to
disqualify
the
mayor
as
judge,
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
or
any
alternative
to
certify
to
a
proper
court.
in
all
of
these
instances,
the
petitioner
was
frustrated
and
a
number
of
it
has
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
trials
and
both
trials
ultimately
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
consolidated
so
that
they
are
here
presented.
a
number
of
rather
aberrant
episodes
occurred
during
which
the
mayor
sought
to
shift
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
accused,
a
period
that
somewhat
surprised
and
amazed
the
defense
council
would
even
challenge
the
credibility
of
a
uniformed
officer
under
oath,
abandoned
to
the
police
officer
witness
the
right
to
determine
whether
he
need
to
answer
questions
put
to
him
by
defense
council.
and
as
a
layman,
not
a
lawyer
relied
rather
substantially
and
heavily
upon
the
prosecutor's
legal
advice.
at
a
hearing
conducted
on
the
affidavit
to
disqualify,
some
additional
information
of
relevance
and
importance
to
the
constitutional
question
here
presented
emerged.
it
was
demonstrated
that
from
the
years
1964
through
1968,
the
five
previous
years,
prior
to
the
conviction
that
of
the
total
number
of
--
total
amount
of
money
in
the
village's
general
funds.
in
each
year
somewhere
between
36%
and
51%
of
all
of
the
general
revenues
of
the
village
came
from
fines
assessed
in
the
mayor's
court.
in
addition,
it
appeared
in
1959,
at
the
time
when
the
village
was
concerned
that
the
jurisdiction
of
mayor's
courts
was
to
be
less
the
alarm
that
the
village
had
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
lessening
of
jurisdiction
of
mayor's
courts
would
somehow
rather
affect
adversely
its
physical
position
is
demonstrated
by
a
village
ordinance
59-9
in
1959
in
which
an
expert
was
hired
in,
at
least
partially,
in
concern
over
the
fact
that
the
decrease
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mayor's
courts
would
involve
some
increased
tax
responsibilities
are
curtailed
services
for
the
members
of
the
village.
that
ordinance
is
reproduced
in
our
brief
and
also
appears
in
the
--
in
the
appendix.
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
as
a
part
of
the
hearings,
a
number
of
other
important
constitutional
facts
were
developed
in
the
case
below.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
established
in
the
law
of
ohio's
clearance,
i
think,
that
the
mayor
is
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
village
with
the
power
to
hire,
fire,
and
supervise
the
police
chief
and
all
the
members
of
the
--
of
the
police
force.
he
has
the
--
he
has
the
power
as
the
sheriff
and
is
to
enforce
the
--
the
piece
in
the
--
within
its
boundaries.
and
in
this
instance,
he
was
--
he
had
the
power
to
do
and
actually
did
appoint
--
the
police
chief
who
was
the
principal
witness
against
the
accused
in
this
case
and
had,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
determine
the
credibility
of
his
employee.
it
is
true
that
there
is
some
approval
required
of
council
in
this
instance.
but
the
--
the
principal
responsibility
in
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
i
think
without
question
is
the
mayor
who
sits
as
the
judge
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
the
ohio
revised
code
section
73715,
18,
73330
and
190520
made
very
clear
his
position
as
chief
law
enforcement
officer
in
the
village.
in
addition,
it
was
developed
and
the
law
is
also
clear
that
the
mayor
is
the
chief
executive
of
the
village
with
financial
responsibility
for
its
physical
condition.
he
is
required
to
report
his
physical
condition
in
the
event
that
there
were
excess
expenditures
or
expenditures
which
are
improper,
he
is
required
to
enforce
it
and
ohio
revised
code
section
73332
and
73333
make
that
abundantly
clear.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
it
does
not.
we
do
not
contend
that
his
salary
was
dependent
upon
the
--
the
outcome
of
a
particular
case
except
that
it
--
it
is
demonstrated
and
it
was
taken
from
the
general
fund.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
would
imagine.
it
was
also
developed
that
the
mayor
is
not
a
lawyer,
not
subject
to
the
canons
of
judicial
ethics
and
yet
required
by
law
to
make
procedural
and
evidentiary
rulings
under
ohio
revised
code
section
293815.
and
that,
inasmuch,
as
he
was
not
a
lawyer,
the
person
from
whom
he
sought
his
legal
advice
was
the
village
solicitor
who
happened
to
be
the
prosecutor
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
you're
quite
right.
i
think
that
that
in
itself
would
not
be
an
unusual
fact.
our
contention
was
that
coupled
with
all
of
the
other
factors
which
keep
the
--
the
tribunal
from
seeing
the
--
the
situation
in
a
neutral
manner,
add
to
the
situation
which
he
is
obtaining
all
of
his
information,
including
matters
of
admissibility
of
evidence
and
so
on
from
a
--
a
source
which
is
biased
in
one
direction
of
the
case.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that
is
not
our
--
our
particular
consideration.
as
a
matter
of
a
fact,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
entire
composite
of
circumstances
under
the
statutory
scheme
which
has
established
mayor's
courts
has
both
executives
in
charge
of
the
functions
of
their
village
and
also
to
see
it
as
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
in
--
in
criminal
manners,
is
in
itself
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
all
of
these
factors
add
together
to
create
the
constitutional
infirmity
of
which
we
complain.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
that
it
is
now
clear
that
under
the
1970
amendments
at
least
which
followed
the
--
the
case
as
it
was
tried
initially,
by
some
two
years,
now
that
there
is
under
section
1905
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the
county
court's
appeal
was
a
matter
of
law,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
additional
skirmish
or
issue
taken
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
and
at
the
supreme
court
level.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
think
that
it
would
not
make
any
difference
because
of
the
fact
that
we
contend
that
it
is
not
necessary
or
condition
to
proceed
to
go
through
an
unconstitutional
trial
in
order
to
get
a
constitutional
one.
our
--
our
position
is
that
they
have
to
go
through
two
--
two
trials
before
you
get
the
minimal
amount
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
stretch
that
far,
mr.
justice
white,
because
so
far
as
we
are
concerned,
at
least
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
the
bare
minimal
amount
of
due
process,
and
we
know
that
in
different
kinds
of
circumstances,
this
court
has
applied
different
standards
of
--
of
due
process.
but
we
say
this,
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
regardless
of
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
entitled
--
entitled
to
--
to
counsel.
regardless
of
whether
he's
entitled
to
have
witnesses
and
all
of
the
other
aspects
that
get
together
in
due
process,
we
think
that
at
the
very
minimum,
even
in
traffic
offenses,
even
in
petty
matters,
that
an
impartial
tribunal,
unquestioned
as
a
result
because
of
his
--
his
role
in
other
matters
is
a
basic
exemption.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
in
this
case,
the
maximum
was
imposed.
it
was
$50.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
could
not
because
under
--
under
the
--
the
rule,
if
the
fine
exceeds
$50,
then
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
individual
who
is
on
trial
is
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
court
of
record
in
as
much
as
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
right.
and
so
we
were
not
so
entitled.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
--
the
court
said
they
have
current
jurisdiction
which
are
courts
of
record
in
ohio
municipal
court
and
the
county
court
set
up
incidentally
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
back
in
1957,
as
a
result
of
the
--
the
legislative
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
abolition
of
the
justice
of
peace
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
not,
but
the
county
courts
have
jurisdiction
where
--
where
the
municipal
courts
do
not.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
it
is
set
out
in
section
1905,
chapter
1905
of
the
ohio
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
--
and
there,
i
would
imagine,
hundreds
of
--
of
such
mayoral
courts.
their
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
--
to
consideration
of
criminal
cases
under
their
village
ordinances
and
moving
traffic
violations
that
occur
within
their
border.
so
that
in
fact,
they
also
had
jurisdiction
over
state
statutory
violations
involving
moving
vehicular
traffic.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
to
the
extent
that
the
accused
actually
has
a
right
to
and
seeks
a
jury
trial.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
a
number
of
tactical
and
financial
reasons
why
somebody
would
decide
that
he
ought
not
to
have
a
jury
trial.
and
in
those
instances,
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
such
cases.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
i
--
i
find
those
such
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
--
no
such
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
find
no
such
statutory
limitation
and
desire
contention
that
traffic
manslaughter
is
indeed
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
if
the
accused
does
not
signature
a
trial.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
he
can.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
section
1905.30
specifically
indicates
that
particularly
in
the
event
of
--
of
the
non-payment
of
a
fine
that
the
individuals
to
be
incarcerated.
and
that
is
--
that
appears
specifically
in
the
statute.
as
i
read
its
jurisdiction,
i
think
that
traffic
manslaughter,
driving
while
intoxicated,
all
of
which
carry
penalties
including
imprisonment
would
be
within
the
court's
jurisdiction,
subject
only
to
the
provision
that
if
an
individual
seeks
a
jury
trial,
he
can
have
it
somewhere
else
and
that
is
in
the
court
of
record.
the
due
process
issue
was
preserved
at
each
level
of
appeal
and
the
hearing
county
court
of
appeals
consolidated
both
cases
and
affirmed
the
convictions
and
the
supreme
court
by
a
five-to-two
decision
and
ohio
did
the
same.
certiorari
was
granted
and
the
issue
is
now
before
us.
i
think
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
belabor
the
point
that
a
neutral,
detached,
impartial
judge
and
fact
finder
is
essential
to
minimum
standards
of
due
process
in
fair
hearings,
both
in
criminal
and
non-criminal
cases.
i
would
only
point
out
that
an
impartial
judge
as
a
requirement
of
fair
hearings
is
as
old
as
the
history
of
courts,
as
old
as
the
judicial
process
itself.
the
whole
point
it
seems
to
me,
of
letting
somebody
have
the
power
to
adjudicate
a
decision
between
two
competing
parties,
is
the
hope
that
the
judge
will
act
in
a
way
which
goes
straight
down
the
middle
and
be
neutral
and
determine
the
result
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
and
not
on
the
basis
of
his
own
self-interest.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
judges
appointed
by
the
mayor,
i
think
that
it
might
not
violate
due
process
under
such
circumstances
so
long
as
the
judge
takes
a
note
and
--
and
performs
as
--
as
officer.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
we
might
run
into
a
question
depending
upon
the
entire
aggregate
of
circumstances
under
those
concerned.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yeah,
it
seems
to
us
that
we
are
asking
too
much.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
--
we
think
that
he's
asking
too
much
of
a
system
and
too
much
of
an
individual
under
the
intertwined
system
in
--
in
which
he
must
wear
the
hat
of
a
policeman
and
the
hat
of
the
impartial
judge
and
the
hat
of
the
administrator
of
--
of
the
village
to
give,
not
only
justice,
but
the
appearance
of
justice
to
which
we
think
that
every
motorist
and
every
individual
comes
within
the
jurisdiction
that
the
court
is
entitled.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
situation
has
changed,
insofar
as
the
statutes
are
concerned
with
respect
to
tumey,
and
since
that
time
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
mayor's
court
has
been
whittled
away
so
that
it
no
longer
involves
countywide
jurisdiction
as
i've
indicated
in
response
and
answer
to
that.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
right.
those
--
those
are
two
distinctions
and
the
fact
that
we
present
to
you
now
as
--
as
distinguished
from
tumey.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
we
think
it
is
less
like
dugan
than
it
is
like
tumey.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
that
--
that
dugan
is
not
applicable
at
all
because
--
because
the
dugan
case
involved
a
--
a
chartered
municipality
and
a
commission
form
of
government
in
which
it
was
conceded
and
stipulated
by
all
of
the
parties,
that
the
person
designated,
the
mayor,
in
that
case,
was
not
the
chief
executive
officer
as
the
mayor
is
in
this
case.
and
that
really,
all
he
was,
was
a
member
of
the
--
a
commission
of
five
persons.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
--
that
he
was
not,
in
anyway,
involved
in
the
executive
operation
of
the
--
of
the
city.
really
that
--
that
executive
responsibility
was
posited
in
the
--
in
the
city
manager.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
he
was
but
the
actual
administrative
or
executive
function
was
confined
in
the
hands
of
the
city
manager
rather
than
the
commission
itself.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
--
that
the
individual
role
of
the
person
who
sat
as
a
mayor
was
subject
to
at
least
the
checks
and
balances
that
the
chartered
system
gave
under
those
circumstances.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
great
deal
of
time
and
attention
in
that
opinion,
a
short
one,
was
devoted
to
the
distinction
between
--
between
the
chartered
system
and
the
mayoral
system
which
--
which
we
had
in
tumey
and
which
appears
presently
before
this
court.
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
only
in
addition
to
tumey
and
dugan
which
--
which
are
at
the
--
at
the
core
of
this
court's
concerns
in
this
case.
in
re
murchison,
which,
i
think,
finishes
the
job
that
was
began
in
tumey,
to
indicate
that
the
appearance
as
well
as
the
actual
form
of
justice
has
got
to
appear.
now,
in
order
to
excuse
the
kind
of
--
of
system
that
we
have
had
in
ohio,
some
arguments
have
been
made
by
the
respondent.
some
arguments
have
been
made
by
legislators
and
i
think
that
there
are
basically
three.
the
first
is
that
this
is
de
minimis
and
that
the
kind
of
damage
that
can
be
done
to
an
accused
in
this
kind
of
court
is
something
that
really
ought
to
be
overlooked,
in
the
interest
of
the
expediency
of
--
of
operating
a
court
and
so
on.
it
is
the
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
--
we
think
that
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
has
been
an
indication
that
that
is
not
an
argument
that
is
--
that
is
necessary
to
deal
with
and
if
the
court
fields
that
we
ought
not,
we
will
move
on
to
our
next
contention,
which
is
--
which
is
a
contention
that
is
made,
that
with
respect
to
the
infliction
of
substantial,
that
no
substantial
damage
can
be
inflicted.
in
response
to
question
from
mr.
justice
stewart,
i've
indicated
that
there
are
grave
consequences.
but
i'd
like
to
add
one
more
to
that,
which
has
not
been
brought
out
and
that
is
that
under
ohio's
point
system
for
the
accumulation
of
points
to
revoke
a
driver's
license,
ohio
revised
code
section
4507.40.
twelve
points
are
necessary
to
take
away
a
driver's
license.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
truck
driver.
he
drives
a
truck
for
a
living.
the
events
of
which
he
was
convicted
under
the
list
of
points
per
violation
that
appear
in
that
statute
would
take
--
would
give
him
six
points.
and
a
mayor's
court,
although
there's
not
a
court
of
record,
for
purposes
of
giving
reports
to
the
bureau
of
motor
vehicles
on
--
in
ohio,
is
indeed
a
court
of
record
for
at
least
that
limited
purpose.
and
so,
as
a
result
of
this
conviction,
half
of
the
necessary
points
to
take
away
his
driver's
license
in
this
court
occurred.
bell
against
burson,
your
case
and
forward
to
u.s.,
i
think
indicates
the
importance
particularly
to
a
--
a
wager
around
the
road
of
having
his
driver's
license.
and
we
would
have
that
point.
i
think
we
have
dealt
with
our
contention
in
response
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
white
with
respect
to
the
appeal
de
novo.
but
i
would
only
add
that
the
appeal
de
novo
is
a
rather
peculiar
animal
in
ohio
and
the
one
that
you
will
be
considering
in
this
case
has
within
it,
a
couple
of
contradictions
that
caused
me
concern
to
think
that
maybe
it
isn't
a
fresh
slate
upon
which
is
written
in
the
new
trial.
our
answer
would
stand
that
we
think
that
you
don't
have
to
have
two
trials
in
order
to
get
one
that's
constitutional.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
another
question
which
i
don't
understand
the
answer
to.
particularly,
i
view
the
fact
that
during
the
course
of
our
appeal
that
new
right
in
our
contention
was
made
available
to
us.
but
i
will
only
urge
that
even
under
the
present
--
the
present
statutory
law,
the
section
1905.30
provides
for
incarceration
and
or
bond.
and
also,
the
1905.24
very
curiously
provides
that
the
appeal,
even
the
appeal
de
novo
which
is
referred
to
in
--
in
the
next
section
cannot
be
even
docketed
unless
a
transcript
to
the
proceedings
below
is
presented
to
the
court.
and
i
ask
for
what
purpose
if
this
is
a
de
novo
hearing.
is
a
transcript
necessary
to
be
prepared
and
how
is
that
to
be
used
either
to
influence
the
court
above
or
to
be
used
as
a
judicial
admission
in
the
taking
of
testimony
or
there
is
no
transcript.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
refer,
the
court
respectfully,
to
read
the
section
1905.24
which
makes
that
a
condition
proceeding
to
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
there
isn't
except
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
it
isn't
the
court
of
record.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
presume
that
--
that
the
parties
can
make
private
arrangement,
but
there
is
no
statutory
arrangement
for
a
statute.
and
i
point
out
only
the
difficulties
in
application
of
the
de
novo
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
practice
i
--
the
practice
i
believe
is
--
is
that
there
--
there
is
ordinarily,
the
practice
is
that
there
is
no
appeal
from
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i'm
sorry.
this
is
the
only
appeal
from
that
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
it
is
new
since
june
of
1970.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
because
the
original
papers
are
also
referred
to,
your
honor,
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure.
it
is
unclear.
also,
the
word
“trial”
as
used
in
that
--
in
that
statute,
and
i
only
suggest
that
merely
calling
something
de
novo
does
not
solve
all
of
the
problems
that
--
that
may
emerge
in
dealing
with
the
question,
and
it's
new.
an
argument
is
also
made
that
the
provisions
of
ohio
revised
code
section
2937.20,
which
provide
for
disqualification
for
bias
is
a
protection
against
excesses
in
the
mayor's
court.
and
we
tried
that
in
this
case,
and
i
--
i'm
here
to
report
to
you
that
it
didn't
work
successfully
unless
you
--
you
feel
that
--
that
at
every
$50-fine
needs
to
come
to
this
court
in
order
to
have
--
to
have
ultimate
adjudication.
what
we
are
saying
basically
is
that
there's
a
difference
between
individual
bias
and
systemic
interest.
and
we
are
saying
that
this
particular
statute
is
designed
to
deal
with
the
mayor
who
happens
to
be
the
brother-in-law
of
an
opposing
party
or
something
to
that
kind,
but
does
not
deal
with
the
inherent
systemic
problems
and
therefore
cannot
be
handled
in
every
case
in
a
way
which
--
which
permits
that
kind
of
--
of
disqualification.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
comments,
i
--
the
fact
that
the
judge
in
this
case
was
a
truck
driver
and
the
defendant
was
a
truck
driver,
i
think
is
not
the
kind
of
trial
by
what
appears
is
that
was
--
was
intended.
i
--
i
would
only
say
that
i
--
i
misspoke
in
my
principal
argument
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
word
“mace.”
the
record
specifically
says
tear
gas
and
i
would
--
i
think
there's
no
constitutional
difference.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
there
was
apparently
an
altercation
after
the
--
the
attempt
by
the
village
constable
to
flag
down
the
accused.
this
occurred
at
a
parking
lot
near
a
restaurant,
some
1,700
feet
beyond
the
point
at
which
the
individual
is
flagged
down.
his
defense
was
that
he
had
a
loaded
truck
and
that
he
could
not
stop
immediately
and
that
it
was
not
safe
to
stop
his
truck
there
and
he
pulled
into
the
first
location
off
the
berm
where
his
truck
could
reasonably
stop.
at
that
point,
the
village
constable
now
the
--
or
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
the
--
the
chief
of
police
of
the
city
took
chase
in
his
automobile,
an
altercation
took
place
there,
during
which
time
--
during
which
time
mr.
ward
was
hit
with
--
with
tear
gas
from
the
police
officer's
cannister.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
mayor
was
not
there
at
that
time.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no.
i
would
point
out
a
--
a
couple
things
that
this
court
has
a
rare
opportunity
to
determine
for
itself,
what,
or
i
should
say
that,
has
a
rare
opportunity
because
it
has
already
been
determined
whether
or
not
the
financial
responsibilities
of
the
mayor
are
such
that
they
involved
him
in
that
kind
of
activity.
in
tumey,
the
very
same
statutes
that
we
have
here
with
respect
to
the
mayor's
responsibility
were
considered
and
the
court
shall
find.
their
numbers
have
been
changed
with
the
renumbering
system
but
this
--
the
language
i
have
checked
and
it
is
identical
with
respect
to
the
responsibility
that
the
mayor
has
for
the
financial
affairs
in
the
city.
and
the
court's
specific
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
i'm
only
talking
about
those
particular
aspects
of
his
financial
responsibility,
which
were
an
issue
here.
i
would
also
urge
with
respect
to
the
necessary
neutrality,
necessary
detachment
which
is
required
although
we
have
not
taken
a
position
that
--
that
separation
of
powers
is
compelled
against
the
state.
we
--
we
do
say
that
this
court
has
drawn
a
line
between
judiciary
action
and
police
action,
at
least,
in
certain
areas.
and
we
have
called
the
court's
attention
in
our
brief,
the
coolidge
against
new
hampshire,
in
which
one
of
the
principle
points
dealt
with
the
importance
of
a
neutral
and
detached
judicial
officer
required
to
issue
a
warrant.
and
in
shadwick
against
tampa,
last
term,
in
407
u.s.,
this
court
in
distinguishing,
are
between
whether
or
not
a
clerk
could
issue
an
arrest
warrant,
made
it
very
clear
that
neutrality
and
detachment
of
the
judicial
officer
requires
severance
and
disengagement
from
activities
of
law
enforcement.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
easy
move
from
the
issuance
of
warrants
to
a
situation
where
a
--
a
determination
is
not
being
made
of
the
threshold
issue
of
probable
cause,
but
really
the
ultimate
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
how
much
more
important
is
it
to
make
sure
that
the
judicial
and
the
police
officers
are
not
intertwined
in
that
way?
we
would
urge
that
in
the
event
that
mayor's
courts
should
be
abolished
or
the
statutory
provision,
dealing
with
them
should
be
dealt
with
appropriately
by
this
court.
no
great
inconvenience
would
occur.
we
are
ready
to
stipulate
that
some
way
could
be
found
in
order
to
take
bond
forfeitures
and
pleas
of
guilty.
our
contention
is
that
when
you
have
a
dispute
that
court
is
of
no
use,
if
we
are
going
to
concern
ourselves
with
minimal
standards
of
due
process.
we
think
that
the
county
courts
which
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
are
available
and
can
set
up
some
kind
of
a
night
procedure
or
some
kind
of
a
procedure
for
bond
forfeitures
and
so
on
to
--
to
adapt
to
the
convenience
of
the
--
of
the
population.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
oh
no.
i
--
i'm
only
responding
to
the
policy
suggestion
that
there
might
be
some
difficultly
if
this
court
did
its
constitutional
duty
and
struck
down
this
court.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
are
saying
that
there
are
a
couple
of
alternatives,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
is
that
it
might
go
to
the
county
court
or
it
might
do
as
it
has
done
in
1957
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
--
in
tumey
in
striking
down
the
justice
of
the
peace
courts,
who
were
paid
on
the
fee
system
decried
by
the
court
in
tumey.
it
set
up
an
entirely
new
court
system
in
order
to
handle
the
traffic
of
problem
and
that's
not
the
county
courts
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
pardon?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
sometimes,
the
decisions
of
this
court
reach
ohio
slowly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
i
think
that's
an
example.
but
they
cited
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
history
that
this
was
the
reason
for
doing
it.
you
have
it
there
sometime
like
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
in
our
brief,
we
have
listed
in
one
of
the
footnotes
approximately
13
to
14
other
states
which
have
this
kind
of
--
of
system.
i
think
they're
probably
are
less
now,
and
their
number
is
dwindling.
there
was
a
time,
i
think,
when
some
40
states
had
some
--
something
similar.
they're
not
all
identical,
of
course,
but
something
similar.
i
think
there
are
now
some
13
states
which
we've
listed
in
our
brief
which
do
have
some
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
yes.
thank
you.
