mr.
burt
neuborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
section
186
of
new
york?s
election
law,
which
imposes
severe
restrictions
upon
qualified
voters
seeking
to
join
the
political
party
of
their
choice
and
to
participate
in
their
party's
primary
elections
in
new
york
state.
the
complex
and
often
indirect
operation
of
new
york?s
deferred
party
enrollment
scheme
is
set
out
at
length
in
petitioner's
brief
at
pages
4
through
7.
but
while
the
operation
of
new
york
scheme
maybe
complex
and
difficult
to
follow,
it's
effect
is
very
clear.
new
york?s
scheme
imposes
two
serious
impediments
upon
the
free
operation
of
the
electoral
process
in
new
york
state.
first,
it
establishes
a
cut
off
period
for
participation
in
a
party
primary
which
is
longer
than
the
cut
off
period
of
any
other
state
in
the
united
states.
in
order
to
qualify
to
participate
in
a
presidential
primary
in
new
york
state
which
is
in
new
york
state
are
held
every
four
years
in
june,
a
potential
party
enrollee
must
enroll
in
october
of
the
preceding
year,
fully
eight
months
before
the
party
primary.
in
order
to
participate
in
a
primary
in
a
none
presidential
year
which
in
new
york
state
are
held
in
september,
a
potential
enrollee
must
enroll
in
the
party
in
october,
fully
11
months
prior
to
the
primary
in
question.
thus
petitioners
in
the
instance
case,
who
registered
to
vote
for
the
first
time
in
december
of
1971
and
who
sought
to
enroll
in
the
party
of
their
choice
for
the
first
time
in
december
of
1971,
were
barred
from
voting
in
the
june
1972
primary
because
their
enrollments
had
not
become
effective
on
or
before
october
2,
1971,
fully
eight
months
before
the
primary.
the
second
impact
which
new
york
statutory
scheme
has
on
the
operation
of
the
political
process
is
to
impose
a
waiting
period
of
a
substantial
period
of
time
between
the
attempt
of
a
voter
to
join
the
party
of
his
choice
and
the
effective
date
of
his
acceptance
by
the
party.
indeed,
petitioners
in
this
case
who
attempted
to
join
the
democratic
party
for
the
first
time
in
december
of
1971
and
be
completed
solemn
declarations
of
party
loyalty
at
that
time
pledging
to
adhere
to
principles
of
the
party
and
to
support
the
candidates
of
the
party
generally
at
the
next
elections,
will
not
be
recognized
by
the
state
of
new
york
as
members
of
the
democratic
party
until
sometime
between
november
14,
1972
and
february
1,
1973,
a
waiting
period
of
between
11
to
14
months.
indeed,
the
drastic
operation
of
new
york?s
law
can
be
understood,
if
we
apply
it
to
a
person
in
new
york
state
who
registers
today
for
the
first
time.
if
one
of
the
two
million
unregistered
voters
in
new
york
qualified
but
unregistered
voters
in
new
york
city
were
today
to
seek
to
enroll
and
to
seek
to
register
in
a
new
york
city
registration
office,
he
would
be
ineligible
to
participate
in
the
primaries
for
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
scheduled
to
be
held
in
september
of
1973
and
his
application
to
become
a
member
of
the
political
party
in
question
would
not
become
effective
under
new
york
law
until
sometime
between
november
15,
1973
and
february
1,
1974.
the
existence
of
so
drastic,
a
curtailment
of
the
political
process
poses
very
serious
constitutional
issues,
but
we
should
note
at
the
outset
that
there
are
several
issues
which
are
not
posed
in
this
case.
there
is
not
posed
in
this
case
any
issue
of
internal
party
regulation
in
that
the
statutes
in
question
are
imposed
by
new
york
state
upon
the
political
parties
of
new
york
whether
or
not
they
wish
to
have
them
applied.
indeed,
in
the
instant
case,
the
democratic
party,
the
party
into
which
the
four
petitioners
sought
entry
in
december
of
1971,
appeared
in
state
court
in
june
of
1972
shortly
before
the
primaries
and
requested
that
petitioners
similarly
situated,
that
that
plaintiffs
similarly
situated
to
the
petitioners
be
permitted
to
participate
in
the
democratic
primary.
that
state
court
preceding
was
dismissed
because
of
lack
of
time
and
has
not
been
re-instituted,
but
we
should
emphasize
that
there
is
no
interest
whatever
in
permitting
the
political
parties
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
regulate
themselves
raised
by
this
case.
nor
does
this
case
necessarily
raise
the
arguably
more
difficult
issue
of
party
switching
or
the
alteration
of
a
pre
existing
party
affiliation.
for
the
four
petitioners
in
this
case
are
all
new
registrants,
first
time
voters,
who
are
seeking
to
do
nothing
more
than
to
register
their
initial
party
affiliation.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
not
sir.
i
think
it
would
simply
permit
those
persons
who
wish
to
join
a
political
party
to
do
so.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
understand
sir.
it
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
frame
the
decision
narrowly
to
apply
only
to
those
persons
who
are
seeking
to
register
their
initial
party
affiliation.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no
sir,
we
are
not,
we
believe
that
the
application
of
the
new
york
process
even
to
persons
who
have
been
members
of
one
political
party
and
who
seek
to
alter
their
party
affiliations
raise
very
serious
constitutional
questions
and
we
believe
that
under
the
least
drastic
alternative
analysis
which
this
court
has
evolved
that
even
those
regulations
cannot
stand,
but
i
simply
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh!
yes
sir.
the
allegations
are
that
they
are
registering
for
the
first
time
and
that
they
had
never
before
been
members
of
any
political
party
and
i
do
not
believe
that
those
facts
are
controverted
or
that
any
contention
to
the
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
that
is
correct
also
your
honor.
mr.
burt
neuborne
precisely,
by
dealing
with
the
potential
class
from
which,
if
raiders
are
to
come
at
all,
they
will
come.
i
suggest
to
the
court
there
is
now
pending
before
the
court,
casper
versus
panticus,
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
in
the
illinois
district
court
in
which
the
issue
of
crossover
participation,
the
issue
of
switching
from
the
republican
party
to
the
democratic
party
was
discussed
by
the
court
below,
the
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional.
and
that
case
i
understand
is
now
pending
on
appeal
before
this
court
now
so
that
if
this
court
wish
to
address
itself
to
the
broader
issue
of
crossovers
as
well
as
initial
party
affiliation,
it
could
do
so
in
the
panticus
case.
the
basic
issue
as
we
see
it
therefore
raised
by
this
case
as
well
in
new
york
may
play
such
drastic
obstacles
in
the
path
of
persons
seeking
to
register
and
record
their
initial
party
affiliation
and
we
think
the
most
obvious
legal
disability
inherent
in
the
new
york
scheme
is
that
it
obviously
operates
as
a
durational
residence
requirement.
indeed,
new
york
state,
i
do
not
understand
to
argue
to
the
contrary.
it
is
conceded
that
any
person
who
established
a
residence
in
new
york
on
or
after
october
2,
1971
was
ineligible
to
participate
in
the
june
1972
primaries
and
it
is
conceded
that
any
person
who
established
to
residence
in
new
york
on
or
after
october
14,
1972
is
currently
ineligible
to
participate
in
the
september
primary
scheduled
for
september
1973.
instead
of
responding
to
the
argument
on
the
merits,
new
york
has
argued
only
that
the
petitioners
as
persons
who
are
long
time
residents
of
new
york
lack
standing
to
raise
the
durational
residence
requirement
issue.
but
there
seems
no
doubt
that
petitioners
have
suffered
an
injury
in
fact
at
the
hands
of
the
new
york?s
differed
enrollment
scheme.
there
seems
no
doubt
that
they
possess
the
classic
adversarial
posture
concerning
the
continuation
of
new
york?s
differed
enrollment
scheme.
and
this
court
in
similar
situations
in
the
past
has
permitted
petitioners
situated
similarly
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case
to
advance
the
arguments
with
persons
who
share
a
basic
community
of
interest
in
dealing
with
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
scheme
before
the
court.
thus
in
pierce
versus
the
society
of
sisters,
thornhill
versus
alabama,
barrows
versus
jackson,
griswold
versus
connecticut,
eisenstadt
versus
baird
and
most
recently
in
the
chief
justice?s
opinion
for
unanimous
court
in
bullock
versus
carter,
the
court
permitted
the
petitioners
before
the
court
to
raise
the
arguments
of
persons
with
whom
they
were
united
in
interest
in
seeking
to
deal
with
an
allegedly
unconstitutional
scheme,
especially
when
the
continuation
of
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
scheme
would
have
an
inhibitory
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
moreover,
the
rosario
case
was
brought
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
persons
who
were
being
impeded
in
attempting
to
join
a
political
party
by
the
operation
of
new
york?s
differed
enrollment
process.
judge
mishler
in
his
opinion
in
the
district
court
specifically
noted
to
be
a
class
action
and
thus
we
suggest
that
the
petitioners
herein
have
classic
standing
to
assert
the
arguments
of
the
members
of
their
class
as
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
section
186.
although
the
durational
residence
requirement,
we
suggest
is
the
most
obvious
violation
of
the
constitution
before
the
court,
quite
clearly
new
york?s
statute
operates
on
long
time
residence
as
well
to
violate
their
right
to
vote
and
participate
in
the
political
process.
this
court
in
the
past
decade
has
forged
a
rigorous
standard
which
must
be
applied
to
state
statutes
which
restrict
the
operation
of
the
franchise.
the
test
that?s
most
recently
formulated
by
the
court
in
dunn
versus
blumstein
is
whether
the
state
statute
at
issue
advances
a
compelling
state
interest
by
the
least
drastic
means.
new
york
state
argues
first
that
because
this
is
a
primary
election
we?re
talking
about
instead
of
a
general
election,
that
some
lesser
weakened
diluted
constitutional
standard
should
apply.
however,
this
court
has
recognized
for
30
years
that
the
right
to
vote
can
be
entirely
frustrated
unless
it
also
includes
the
right
to
participate
in
the
nominating
process.
indeed,
as
the
chief
justice
noted
in
bullock
versus
carter,
often
the
outcome
of
a
primary
election
is
even
more
important
than
the
outcome
of
the
general
election
because
quite
often
you
have
one
party
safe
seats.
this
is
specially
so
in
a
state
like
new
york
where
one
party
strongholds
have
existed
since
the
civil
war
and
there
were
numerous
primary
elections.
mr.
burt
neuborne
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
adjourned
for
lunch,
we
had
begun
to
discuss
the
argument
made
by
new
york
state
that
because
this
is
a
primary
election
that
we?re
dealing
with
here
instead
of
a
general
election
that
some
more
relaxed
constitutional
standard
maybe
utilized
to
judge
state
statutes
restricting
the
interested
parties
from
participating
in
such
an
election.
and
i
had
invited
the
court?s
attention
to
a
line
of
precedent
which
begun
30
years
ago
in
this
court
and
culminated
in
the
chief
justice?s
recent
opinion
in
bullock
versus
carter
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
outcome
of
a
primary
election
is
often
more
important
than
the
outcome
of
the
general
election
itself
and
that
for
precisely
those
reasons,
if
the
right
to
vote
is
to
receive
adequate
protection,
it
must
also
include
the
right
to
participate
in
the
process
by
which
the
candidates
are
chosen.
and
indeed,
that
has
been
the
law
in
new
york
state
pursuant
to
new
york
state
law
since
1911.
thus,
whatever
the
constitutional
standard
is
that
is
to
be
utilized
in
judging
the
constitutionality
of
state
statutes
restrictive
of
the
franchise,
petitioners
submit
that
the
same
standard
must
be
utilized
in
judging
statutes
which
restrict
participation
in
primary
elections.
the
state
argues,
however,
that
even
if
one
applies
the
compelling
state
interest
test
to
the
statutory
scheme
before
the
court,
new
york
is
able
to
meet
that
test
because
the
statutory
scheme
deters
bad
faith
raiding
of
a
political
party
by
persons
not
in
sympathy
with
the
parties
principles
who
will
attempt
to
participate
in
that
party's
primary
election
to
in
some
way
injure
the
party.
however,
even
assuming
that
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
in
guarding
against
bad
faith
raidiing
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
very
real
question
exists
as
to
whether
the
state
possess
any
compelling
interest
at
all
in
prohibiting
persons
attempting
to
affiliate
with
a
political
party
for
the
first
time
to
affiliate
with
that
party.
but
even
assuming
that
the
state
does
possess
some
compelling
interest
in
the
prevention
of
fraudulent
participation
in
the
primary,
it?s
clear
that
at
least
five
less
drastic
alternatives
exist
by
which
new
york
state
could
advance
its
commendable
interest
in
this
case
without
at
the
same
time
causing
the
broad
disenfranchisement
of
thousands
of
new
york
voters
each
year.
first
and
most
obviously,
new
york
already
has
a
very
effective
device
to
guard
against
bad
faith
raidiing.
section
332
of
new
york?s
election
law
provides
that
a
person
enrolling
in
a
political
party
maybe
summarily
dis-enrolled
at
the
instigation
of
a
member
of
the
party
after
a
hearing
before
a
party
functionary
upon
a
finding
that
the
attempted
enrollee
was
not
in
good
faith
in
his
attempt
to
join
the
political
party.
the
operation
of
section
332
in
new
york
state
has
been
one
of
extreme
effectiveness.
indeed,
the
history
of
section
332
in
new
york
state
demonstrates
beyond
argument
that
it
has
been
an
effective
tool
to
deal
with
precisely
the
evil
which
new
york
state
contends
section
186
is
designed
to
deal.
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
the
proof
that
has
been
adduced
in
the
various
cases
was
to
show
a
pattern
of
persons
moving
from
one
party
into
another
party
filing
virtually
identical
declaratory
statements
with
a
long
history
of
having
been
engaged
in
a
contrary
political
activity
and
some
evidence
that
they
intended
at
some
future
time
to
go
back
to
that
party.
the
hearings
under
section
332
are
reported
in
a
number
of
new
york
cases,
the
most
significant
of
which
i
suggest
is
zuckman
versus
donahue
where
900
persons
who
were
allegedly
raidiing
in
a
political
party
context
were
dis-enrolled
after
a
judicial
hearing
demonstrating
that
they
were
attempting
to
enroll
in
bad
faith.
as
chief
judge
mishler
pointed
out
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
it?s
brought
on
exceptionally
quickly,
yes
sir.
it
maybe
--
the
initial
hearing
is
one
held
before
the
county
committee
man
of
the
party
itself.
now
of
course
that
hearing
must
in
order
to
be
constitutionally
permissible
must
be
subject
to
judicial
review,
but
it?s
subject
to
judicial
review
on
a
summary
petition
with
a
very,
very
expeditious
consideration
and
has
in
the
past
in
new
york
worked
admirably
in
dealing
with
precisely
this
problem.
mr.
burt
neuborne
there
are
approximately
10
reported
cases
in
new
york
state,
situations
such
as
this.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
we?ve
had
section
186
on
the
books,
in
one
form
or
another
since
the
end
of
the
19th
century.
the
summary
dis-enrollment
procedure
has
been
available
to
us
for
a
substantially
shorter
period
of
time,
but
my
recollection
is
your
honor
that
the
earliest
cases
approximately
1930
that's
cited
in
the
reports.
most
of
the
raidiing,
if
that?s
what
one
can
call
that
has
gone
in
new
york,
went
on
during
the
period
when
the
american
labor
party
disintegrated
into
two
wings,
the
american
labor
party
and
the
liberal
party
at
a
contest
commenced
with
what
had
been
the
constituency
of
the
american
labor
party
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
most
of
the
raidiing
situations
came
up
and
even
in
that
context,
a
heated
political
struggle
between
to
factions,
332
was
utilized
with
great
effectiveness
in
maintaining
the
purity
of
both
political
parties.
mr.
burt
neuborne
section
186,
your
honor?
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir.
the
statutory
scheme
of
having
an
enrollment
box
which
is
open
once
a
year,
i
have
traced
back
to
1898.
it
is
in
the
codification
of
the
election
law
in
1909
that
has
been
continued
forward
to
the
present
time.
chief
judge
mishler
writing
in
the
district
court
noted
the
effectiveness
of
section
332
as
a
device
to
guard
against
party
raidiing
and
i
note
in
passing
that
chief
judge
mishler
spoke
with
a
great
deal
of
experience
before
his
elevation
to
the
bench
in
1961,
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
queens
county
republican
party
and
had
been
its
candidate
for
public
office
on
a
number
of
occasions,
is
familiar
with
the
operation
of
the
political
process
in
new
york
and
recognized
section
332
for
what
it
is,
a
very
effective
device
to
guard
against
bad
faith
raidiing.
a
second
less
drastic
alternative
open
to
new
york
would
be
to
apply
these
restrictive
affiliation
rules
only
to
those
political
parties
who
want
them.
in
other
words,
if
a
party
thinks
that
it
is
some
way
being
endangered,
it
could,
i
suppose
new
york
could
if
it
wished
to
setup
a
statutory
scheme
that
allowed
a
party
some
option
in
protecting
itself.
new
york
has
not
chosen
to
do
this,
has
chosen
instead
to
impose
these
restrictive
rules
on
parties
whether
or
not
they
wish
them
and
indeed
in
this
particular
case,
the
democratic
party
went
to
court
to
say
precisely
that
it
didn?t
want
them
and
nevertheless,
was
forced
to
live
with
them.
the
third
less
drastic
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
not
sir.
i
think
the
first
answer
is
that,
if
that?s
what
is
necessary
to
permit
persons
to
vote,
the
fact
that
it
would
be
administratively
more
difficult
to
operate
would
not
be
a
sufficient
justification
for
not
utilizing
it,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
wouldn't
--
that
it
would
create
substantial
administrative
problems
because
it
would
be
perfectly
possible.
we
only
have
--
we
four
parties
in
new
york
state,
the
republican,
the
democratic,
liberal
and
conservative.
it
would
be
perfectly
feasible
if
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
wished
to
permit
those
parties
to
opt
for
some
form
of
differed
enrollment
process
and
simply
have
the
registrars
make
the
entries
as
to
who
is
a
party
member
at
the
point
in
time
which
the
political
party
wished.
in
other
words,
those
parties
which
did
not
opt
would
have
the
entries
immediately.
those
parties
which
did
opt
could
if
they
wished,
have
the
material
in
the
enrollment
box
for
a
period
of
time,
but
the
same
number
of
entries
would
have
to
be
made
by
the
administrative
officials.
it
would
simply
be
making
them
over
a
longer
period
of
time,
indeed,
it
might
your
honor,
it
might
be
administratively
easier
to
do
it
this
way
because
the
way
the
system
works
now
all
party
enrollments
in
a
year
must
be
entered
by
the
officials
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
as
soon
as
the
enrollment
box
is
open
in
mid
november,
every
enrollment
that?s
been
made
during
a
preceding
year
must
be
entered
within
a
very
short
time,
creating
a
very
serious
administrative
backlog
for
the
process.
part
of
the
option
might
have
the
effect
of
spreading
it
out
over
a
longer
period
of
time
and
making
it
administratively
more
workable.
i
do
not
suggest
that
i?m
in
favor
of
the
party
option.
i
merely
pose
it
to
the
court
as
a
possible
less
drastic
alternative
which
new
york
could
have
utilized.
a
third
less
drastic
alternative
which
we
discussed
earlier
was
the
application
of
this
particular
statute
to
the
class
which
even
arguably
the
only
class
which
even
arguably
posses
a
danger
of
raidiing
and
that?s
those
persons
who
have
a
preexisting
party
affiliation
and
who
are
seeking
to
alter
that
preexisting
party
affiliation.
every
single
instance
of
raidiing
which
has
been
cited
in
the
new
york
reports
and
which
has
been
discussed
by
the
attorney
general
has
involved
persons
of
a
preexisting
party
affiliation
attempting
to
alter
that
affiliation
to
participate
in
the
affairs
of
another
party.
indeed,
no
other
state
except
new
york
has
found
it
necessary
to
apply
these
types
of
restrictions
to
persons
seeking
to
newly
affiliate
with
a
political
party.
in
city
of
phoenix
versus
kolodziejski,
mr.
justice
white
writing
for
this
court
noted
that
it
would
not
be
permissible
for
a
state
to
base
electoral
restrictions
upon
a
hypothetical
possibility
not
reasonably
likely
to
occur
and
in
that
case,
he
pointed
out
that
only
14
other
states
had
similar
restrictions
upon
the
franchise.
well,
this
case
is
even
dramatically
more
insubstantial,
in
that
no
other
state
has
seen
fit
to
impose
this
type
of
restriction
upon
persons
attempting
to
affiliate
with
a
political
party
for
the
first
time.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
don?t
clam
to
be
an
expert
on
the
political
party
structure
of
the
other
49
states
but
i
would
be
surprised
if
there
were
not
minority
parties
in
other
states
as
well.
if
ohio,
illinois,
california,
pennsylvania
can
get
along
without
this
type
of
restriction
applied
to
newly
enrolled
persons
seeking
to
merely
to
register
their
initial
party
affiliation,
it?s
inconceivable
to
know
that
new
york
requires
this
type
of
drastic,
drastic
restriction
which
has
the
effect
of
barring
persons
in
the
similarly
situated
from
the
petitioners
from
participating
in
the
primary
despite
the
fact
that
they
tried
to
enroll
in
that
primary
over
six
months
before
it
was
held.
the
fourth
less
drastic
alternative
would
be
a
reliance
upon
the
loyalty
oath
which
new
york
state
currently
requires
persons
attempting
to
enroll
in
political
party
to
sign.
in
order
to
enroll
in
a
political
party
in
new
york,
one
must
file
a
solemn
declaration
of
adherence
to
party
principle
and
a
solemn
declaration
of
intention
to
support
the
nominees
of
the
party
at
the
next
general
election.
that
requirement
forbids
casual
party
affiliation
in
new
york
and
it
has
the
effect
of
making
it
virtually
impossible
for
large
casual
party
switches
to
occur.
in
other
words,
we
must
assume
if
there
was
to
be
an
evil
in
new
york
state
that
persons
will
fraudulently
execute
this
affiliation,
these
enrollment
blanks
and
it
is
we
believe
inconceivable
to
think
that
large
scale
fraudulence
switching
will
occur.
finally,
if
large
scale
fraudulence
switching
does
occur
in
violation
of
the
party
loyalty
oaths,
new
york
maintains
a
comprehensive
system
of
criminal
sanctions
for
fraudulent
participation
in
the
electoral
process
which
is
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
dunn
versus
blumstein
can
be
used
effectively
to
guard
against
fraud.
so
that
really
what
new
york
has
done
here
has
not
used
the
least
drastic
alternative.
the
only
way
to
describe
what
they?ve
done
is
they?ve
used
the
most
drastic
possible
alternative
to
deal
with
this
problem
and
they
therefore,
and
in
so
doing
have
unnecessarily
disenfranchised
thousands
and
thousands
of
new
yorkers.
even
if
this
case
did
not
involve
voting
rights,
even
if
it
did
not
involve
a
delusion
of
the
franchise
and
the
triggering
of
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
it
would
never
the
less
raise
the
most
serious
questions
under
the
association
freedoms
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
because
the
effect
of
new
york
statutory
scheme
is
to
create
a
waiting
period
which
forces
persons
attempting
to
join
a
political
party
to
wait
as
long
as
14
months
before
they?re
accepted
into
that
party.
now,
the
right
to
join,
the
right
to
associate
with
the
political
party
for
the
advancement
of
common
beliefs
is
the
core
association
of
freedom
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
it
is
the
most
important
association
of
freedom
we
have.
now,
before
new
york
can
impose
this
type
of
drastic
and
unique
interference
with
the
operation
of
that
associational
freedom,
it
must
come
forward
and
demonstrate
some
overwriting
societal
interest
which
can
be
advanced
by
no
less
drastic
means.
that
is
precisely
the
test
that
mr.
justice
harland
used
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
williams
versus
rhodes
when
he
analyzed
the
impact
of
the
ohio
election
law
and
ruled
that
it
had
an
impermissible
constitutional
effect
upon
persons
attempting
to
associate
for
the
advancement
of
common
political
goals
in
ohio.
we
suggest
that
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
test,
the
constitutional
test
which
mr.
justice
harland
utilized
in
williams
versus
rhodes
is
very
similar
in
operation
and
effect
to
the
compelling
state
interest
test
which
mr.
justice
marshall
utilized
in
dunn
versus
blumstein.
they
worked
very,
very
similarly.
they
come
out
just
about
the
same
and
they
do
because
they
are
both
designed
to
protect
the
single
most
important
values
that
we
can
possibly
have
in
a
democracy
which
is
the
right
to
participate
in
the
political
process
by
which
our
leaders
are
chosen.
that
is
an
ultimate
first
amendment
right
as
well
as
the
right
to
vote.
and
we
suggest
therefore
that
even
if
as
mr.
justice
harland
did
in
williams
versus
rhodes,
even
if
one
is
to
choose
the
crime
where
evans
versus
cornman
done
a
line
of
authority
and
analyses
this
case
solely
as
an
association
of
freedom
test.
the
interests
which
new
state
has
advanced
are
far,
far
less
compelling
than
most
which
this
court
has
rejected
in
association
with
freedom
cases
in
the
past.
if
i
may
your
honor,
i?d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir.
the
friedman
case
your
honor
was
here
prior
to
this
case,
however,
two
distinguishing
characteristics
existed
in
friedman
case.
first,
friedman
was
attempting
to
be
a
candidate
similar
to
the
lippitt
situation
where
the
candidate
in
lippitt
was
attempting
to
run
not
vote
and
as
the
chief
justice
noted
in
bullock
versus
carter,
the
right
to
become
a
candidate
maybe
very
different
than
the
right
to
actually
vote
in
a
particular
election.
secondly,
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
know
of
no
provision
that
deals
only
with
candidates
so
assume
it
was
this.
mr.
burt
neuborne
secondly,
a
more
importantly
your
honor,
i
suggest
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
to
a
person
who
wished
to
become
a
candidate.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
the
major
distinction
that
i
have
with
that
case
is
that
the
record
in
that
case
indicated
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
question
as
to
the
good
fate
of
mr.
friedman?s
residence
and
in
fact
there
was
an
adequate
state
ground
upon
which
the
state
court
pass
on
that
case,
that
there
was
serious
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
address
from
which
he
was
attempting
to
enroll.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
i
understand
that
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
there
were
serious
statements
by
the
state
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
that
is
correct
sir.
however,
i
wish
to
reiteraid
that
that
was
again
a
candidate
case
very
much
as
lippitt
was
a
candidate
case.
more
importantly
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
but
his
right
to
become
a
candidate
triggered
the
particular
test
that
the
court
was
utilizing
at
that
time.
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
bullock,
a
very
different
set
of
considerations
come
into
play
when
the
person?s
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
i?m
frankly
troubled
by
that
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
was
troubled
by
the
distinction
in
lippitt
however,
it
is
a
distinction
which
has
been
made
by
this
court
and
which
does
distinguish
the
friedman
case.
briefly,
i?d
wish
to
point
out
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
could
have
registered
during
the
brief
period
between
the
time
of
twenty-sixth
amendment
was
ratified
in
june
of
1971
and
the
close
of
registration
in
new
york
in
october
of
1971,
but
they
would
have
been
registering
in
connection
with
elections
in
new
york
state
where
the
highest
office
at
stake
was
that
at
county
executive
and
where
they
turn
out
was
exceptionally
law
simply
because
there
were
no
significant
issues
presented
to
the
electoraid
at
that
time.
indeed,
the
turnout
was
so
low
that
vast
bulk
of
persons
who
registered
under
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
did
so
after
the
1971
general
election.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no
sir,
i
don?t
think
its
inadvertence,
judge
dooling
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
your
honor,
where
the
highest
office
at
stake
was
that
of
county
executive.
in
the
particular
primary
where
they
sought
to
enroll,
they
were
attempting
to
participate
in
a
presidential
primary
in
new
york.
judge
dooking
in
a
related
case
noted
that
you
can
swim
365
days
a
year
but
you
only
do
it
when
its
hot
and
that
is
a,
you
can
register
quite
often
but
you
only
do
it
when
the
political
season
begins
to
heat
up
and
this,
i
submit
to
you
that
these
petitioners
attempted
to
register
to
vote
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
that
maybe
so
your
honor,
yes
sir
but
again
you
only
raid
i
submit
if
you?re
moving
to
one
party
to
another.
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh,
no
question
about
it
sir,
it
would
have
been
virtually
impossible
for
large
numbers
of
peoples
?-
mr.
burt
neuborne
well
your
honor,
we
move
this
expeditiously
as
possible.
the
case
was
decided,
the
case
was
filed
immediately
after
they
were
denied
their
enrollment.
it
was
decided
by
judge
mishler
within
three
weeks,
it
then
went
up
on
an
expeditor
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
where
it
was
argued
on
february
24,
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
april
24,
we
lodged
a
certiorari
petition
that
same
day
with
this
court
and
move
for
a
stay,
the
stay
was
temporarily
granted
by
mr.
justice
marshall
on
the
26th
so
that
i
think
that
petitioners
move
as
absolutely
as
expeditiously
as
they
could.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
burt
neuborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
section
186
of
new
york?s
election
law,
which
imposes
severe
restrictions
upon
qualified
voters
seeking
to
join
the
political
party
of
their
choice
and
to
participate
in
their
party's
primary
elections
in
new
york
state.
the
complex
and
often
indirect
operation
of
new
york?s
deferred
party
enrollment
scheme
is
set
out
at
length
in
petitioner's
brief
at
pages
4
through
7.
but
while
the
operation
of
new
york
scheme
maybe
complex
and
difficult
to
follow,
it's
effect
is
very
clear.
new
york?s
scheme
imposes
two
serious
impediments
upon
the
free
operation
of
the
electoral
process
in
new
york
state.
first,
it
establishes
a
cut
off
period
for
participation
in
a
party
primary
which
is
longer
than
the
cut
off
period
of
any
other
state
in
the
united
states.
in
order
to
qualify
to
participate
in
a
presidential
primary
in
new
york
state
which
is
in
new
york
state
are
held
every
four
years
in
june,
a
potential
party
enrollee
must
enroll
in
october
of
the
preceding
year,
fully
eight
months
before
the
party
primary.
in
order
to
participate
in
a
primary
in
a
none
presidential
year
which
in
new
york
state
are
held
in
september,
a
potential
enrollee
must
enroll
in
the
party
in
october,
fully
11
months
prior
to
the
primary
in
question.
thus
petitioners
in
the
instance
case,
who
registered
to
vote
for
the
first
time
in
december
of
1971
and
who
sought
to
enroll
in
the
party
of
their
choice
for
the
first
time
in
december
of
1971,
were
barred
from
voting
in
the
june
1972
primary
because
their
enrollments
had
not
become
effective
on
or
before
october
2,
1971,
fully
eight
months
before
the
primary.
the
second
impact
which
new
york
statutory
scheme
has
on
the
operation
of
the
political
process
is
to
impose
a
waiting
period
of
a
substantial
period
of
time
between
the
attempt
of
a
voter
to
join
the
party
of
his
choice
and
the
effective
date
of
his
acceptance
by
the
party.
indeed,
petitioners
in
this
case
who
attempted
to
join
the
democratic
party
for
the
first
time
in
december
of
1971
and
be
completed
solemn
declarations
of
party
loyalty
at
that
time
pledging
to
adhere
to
principles
of
the
party
and
to
support
the
candidates
of
the
party
generally
at
the
next
elections,
will
not
be
recognized
by
the
state
of
new
york
as
members
of
the
democratic
party
until
sometime
between
november
14,
1972
and
february
1,
1973,
a
waiting
period
of
between
11
to
14
months.
indeed,
the
drastic
operation
of
new
york?s
law
can
be
understood,
if
we
apply
it
to
a
person
in
new
york
state
who
registers
today
for
the
first
time.
if
one
of
the
two
million
unregistered
voters
in
new
york
qualified
but
unregistered
voters
in
new
york
city
were
today
to
seek
to
enroll
and
to
seek
to
register
in
a
new
york
city
registration
office,
he
would
be
ineligible
to
participate
in
the
primaries
for
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
scheduled
to
be
held
in
september
of
1973
and
his
application
to
become
a
member
of
the
political
party
in
question
would
not
become
effective
under
new
york
law
until
sometime
between
november
15,
1973
and
february
1,
1974.
the
existence
of
so
drastic,
a
curtailment
of
the
political
process
poses
very
serious
constitutional
issues,
but
we
should
note
at
the
outset
that
there
are
several
issues
which
are
not
posed
in
this
case.
there
is
not
posed
in
this
case
any
issue
of
internal
party
regulation
in
that
the
statutes
in
question
are
imposed
by
new
york
state
upon
the
political
parties
of
new
york
whether
or
not
they
wish
to
have
them
applied.
indeed,
in
the
instant
case,
the
democratic
party,
the
party
into
which
the
four
petitioners
sought
entry
in
december
of
1971,
appeared
in
state
court
in
june
of
1972
shortly
before
the
primaries
and
requested
that
petitioners
similarly
situated,
that
that
plaintiffs
similarly
situated
to
the
petitioners
be
permitted
to
participate
in
the
democratic
primary.
that
state
court
preceding
was
dismissed
because
of
lack
of
time
and
has
not
been
re-instituted,
but
we
should
emphasize
that
there
is
no
interest
whatever
in
permitting
the
political
parties
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
regulate
themselves
raised
by
this
case.
nor
does
this
case
necessarily
raise
the
arguably
more
difficult
issue
of
party
switching
or
the
alteration
of
a
pre
existing
party
affiliation.
for
the
four
petitioners
in
this
case
are
all
new
registrants,
first
time
voters,
who
are
seeking
to
do
nothing
more
than
to
register
their
initial
party
affiliation.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
not
sir.
i
think
it
would
simply
permit
those
persons
who
wish
to
join
a
political
party
to
do
so.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
understand
sir.
it
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
frame
the
decision
narrowly
to
apply
only
to
those
persons
who
are
seeking
to
register
their
initial
party
affiliation.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no
sir,
we
are
not,
we
believe
that
the
application
of
the
new
york
process
even
to
persons
who
have
been
members
of
one
political
party
and
who
seek
to
alter
their
party
affiliations
raise
very
serious
constitutional
questions
and
we
believe
that
under
the
least
drastic
alternative
analysis
which
this
court
has
evolved
that
even
those
regulations
cannot
stand,
but
i
simply
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh!
yes
sir.
the
allegations
are
that
they
are
registering
for
the
first
time
and
that
they
had
never
before
been
members
of
any
political
party
and
i
do
not
believe
that
those
facts
are
controverted
or
that
any
contention
to
the
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
that
is
correct
also
your
honor.
mr.
burt
neuborne
precisely,
by
dealing
with
the
potential
class
from
which,
if
raiders
are
to
come
at
all,
they
will
come.
i
suggest
to
the
court
there
is
now
pending
before
the
court,
casper
versus
panticus,
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
in
the
illinois
district
court
in
which
the
issue
of
crossover
participation,
the
issue
of
switching
from
the
republican
party
to
the
democratic
party
was
discussed
by
the
court
below,
the
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional.
and
that
case
i
understand
is
now
pending
on
appeal
before
this
court
now
so
that
if
this
court
wish
to
address
itself
to
the
broader
issue
of
crossovers
as
well
as
initial
party
affiliation,
it
could
do
so
in
the
panticus
case.
the
basic
issue
as
we
see
it
therefore
raised
by
this
case
as
well
in
new
york
may
play
such
drastic
obstacles
in
the
path
of
persons
seeking
to
register
and
record
their
initial
party
affiliation
and
we
think
the
most
obvious
legal
disability
inherent
in
the
new
york
scheme
is
that
it
obviously
operates
as
a
durational
residence
requirement.
indeed,
new
york
state,
i
do
not
understand
to
argue
to
the
contrary.
it
is
conceded
that
any
person
who
established
a
residence
in
new
york
on
or
after
october
2,
1971
was
ineligible
to
participate
in
the
june
1972
primaries
and
it
is
conceded
that
any
person
who
established
to
residence
in
new
york
on
or
after
october
14,
1972
is
currently
ineligible
to
participate
in
the
september
primary
scheduled
for
september
1973.
instead
of
responding
to
the
argument
on
the
merits,
new
york
has
argued
only
that
the
petitioners
as
persons
who
are
long
time
residents
of
new
york
lack
standing
to
raise
the
durational
residence
requirement
issue.
but
there
seems
no
doubt
that
petitioners
have
suffered
an
injury
in
fact
at
the
hands
of
the
new
york?s
differed
enrollment
scheme.
there
seems
no
doubt
that
they
possess
the
classic
adversarial
posture
concerning
the
continuation
of
new
york?s
differed
enrollment
scheme.
and
this
court
in
similar
situations
in
the
past
has
permitted
petitioners
situated
similarly
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case
to
advance
the
arguments
with
persons
who
share
a
basic
community
of
interest
in
dealing
with
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
scheme
before
the
court.
thus
in
pierce
versus
the
society
of
sisters,
thornhill
versus
alabama,
barrows
versus
jackson,
griswold
versus
connecticut,
eisenstadt
versus
baird
and
most
recently
in
the
chief
justice?s
opinion
for
unanimous
court
in
bullock
versus
carter,
the
court
permitted
the
petitioners
before
the
court
to
raise
the
arguments
of
persons
with
whom
they
were
united
in
interest
in
seeking
to
deal
with
an
allegedly
unconstitutional
scheme,
especially
when
the
continuation
of
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
scheme
would
have
an
inhibitory
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
moreover,
the
rosario
case
was
brought
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
persons
who
were
being
impeded
in
attempting
to
join
a
political
party
by
the
operation
of
new
york?s
differed
enrollment
process.
judge
mishler
in
his
opinion
in
the
district
court
specifically
noted
to
be
a
class
action
and
thus
we
suggest
that
the
petitioners
herein
have
classic
standing
to
assert
the
arguments
of
the
members
of
their
class
as
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
section
186.
although
the
durational
residence
requirement,
we
suggest
is
the
most
obvious
violation
of
the
constitution
before
the
court,
quite
clearly
new
york?s
statute
operates
on
long
time
residence
as
well
to
violate
their
right
to
vote
and
participate
in
the
political
process.
this
court
in
the
past
decade
has
forged
a
rigorous
standard
which
must
be
applied
to
state
statutes
which
restrict
the
operation
of
the
franchise.
the
test
that?s
most
recently
formulated
by
the
court
in
dunn
versus
blumstein
is
whether
the
state
statute
at
issue
advances
a
compelling
state
interest
by
the
least
drastic
means.
new
york
state
argues
first
that
because
this
is
a
primary
election
we?re
talking
about
instead
of
a
general
election,
that
some
lesser
weakened
diluted
constitutional
standard
should
apply.
however,
this
court
has
recognized
for
30
years
that
the
right
to
vote
can
be
entirely
frustrated
unless
it
also
includes
the
right
to
participate
in
the
nominating
process.
indeed,
as
the
chief
justice
noted
in
bullock
versus
carter,
often
the
outcome
of
a
primary
election
is
even
more
important
than
the
outcome
of
the
general
election
because
quite
often
you
have
one
party
safe
seats.
this
is
specially
so
in
a
state
like
new
york
where
one
party
strongholds
have
existed
since
the
civil
war
and
there
were
numerous
primary
elections.
mr.
burt
neuborne
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
adjourned
for
lunch,
we
had
begun
to
discuss
the
argument
made
by
new
york
state
that
because
this
is
a
primary
election
that
we?re
dealing
with
here
instead
of
a
general
election
that
some
more
relaxed
constitutional
standard
maybe
utilized
to
judge
state
statutes
restricting
the
interested
parties
from
participating
in
such
an
election.
and
i
had
invited
the
court?s
attention
to
a
line
of
precedent
which
begun
30
years
ago
in
this
court
and
culminated
in
the
chief
justice?s
recent
opinion
in
bullock
versus
carter
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
outcome
of
a
primary
election
is
often
more
important
than
the
outcome
of
the
general
election
itself
and
that
for
precisely
those
reasons,
if
the
right
to
vote
is
to
receive
adequate
protection,
it
must
also
include
the
right
to
participate
in
the
process
by
which
the
candidates
are
chosen.
and
indeed,
that
has
been
the
law
in
new
york
state
pursuant
to
new
york
state
law
since
1911.
thus,
whatever
the
constitutional
standard
is
that
is
to
be
utilized
in
judging
the
constitutionality
of
state
statutes
restrictive
of
the
franchise,
petitioners
submit
that
the
same
standard
must
be
utilized
in
judging
statutes
which
restrict
participation
in
primary
elections.
the
state
argues,
however,
that
even
if
one
applies
the
compelling
state
interest
test
to
the
statutory
scheme
before
the
court,
new
york
is
able
to
meet
that
test
because
the
statutory
scheme
deters
bad
faith
raiding
of
a
political
party
by
persons
not
in
sympathy
with
the
parties
principles
who
will
attempt
to
participate
in
that
party's
primary
election
to
in
some
way
injure
the
party.
however,
even
assuming
that
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
in
guarding
against
bad
faith
raidiing
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
very
real
question
exists
as
to
whether
the
state
possess
any
compelling
interest
at
all
in
prohibiting
persons
attempting
to
affiliate
with
a
political
party
for
the
first
time
to
affiliate
with
that
party.
but
even
assuming
that
the
state
does
possess
some
compelling
interest
in
the
prevention
of
fraudulent
participation
in
the
primary,
it?s
clear
that
at
least
five
less
drastic
alternatives
exist
by
which
new
york
state
could
advance
its
commendable
interest
in
this
case
without
at
the
same
time
causing
the
broad
disenfranchisement
of
thousands
of
new
york
voters
each
year.
first
and
most
obviously,
new
york
already
has
a
very
effective
device
to
guard
against
bad
faith
raidiing.
section
332
of
new
york?s
election
law
provides
that
a
person
enrolling
in
a
political
party
maybe
summarily
dis-enrolled
at
the
instigation
of
a
member
of
the
party
after
a
hearing
before
a
party
functionary
upon
a
finding
that
the
attempted
enrollee
was
not
in
good
faith
in
his
attempt
to
join
the
political
party.
the
operation
of
section
332
in
new
york
state
has
been
one
of
extreme
effectiveness.
indeed,
the
history
of
section
332
in
new
york
state
demonstrates
beyond
argument
that
it
has
been
an
effective
tool
to
deal
with
precisely
the
evil
which
new
york
state
contends
section
186
is
designed
to
deal.
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
the
proof
that
has
been
adduced
in
the
various
cases
was
to
show
a
pattern
of
persons
moving
from
one
party
into
another
party
filing
virtually
identical
declaratory
statements
with
a
long
history
of
having
been
engaged
in
a
contrary
political
activity
and
some
evidence
that
they
intended
at
some
future
time
to
go
back
to
that
party.
the
hearings
under
section
332
are
reported
in
a
number
of
new
york
cases,
the
most
significant
of
which
i
suggest
is
zuckman
versus
donahue
where
900
persons
who
were
allegedly
raidiing
in
a
political
party
context
were
dis-enrolled
after
a
judicial
hearing
demonstrating
that
they
were
attempting
to
enroll
in
bad
faith.
as
chief
judge
mishler
pointed
out
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
it?s
brought
on
exceptionally
quickly,
yes
sir.
it
maybe
--
the
initial
hearing
is
one
held
before
the
county
committee
man
of
the
party
itself.
now
of
course
that
hearing
must
in
order
to
be
constitutionally
permissible
must
be
subject
to
judicial
review,
but
it?s
subject
to
judicial
review
on
a
summary
petition
with
a
very,
very
expeditious
consideration
and
has
in
the
past
in
new
york
worked
admirably
in
dealing
with
precisely
this
problem.
mr.
burt
neuborne
there
are
approximately
10
reported
cases
in
new
york
state,
situations
such
as
this.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
we?ve
had
section
186
on
the
books,
in
one
form
or
another
since
the
end
of
the
19th
century.
the
summary
dis-enrollment
procedure
has
been
available
to
us
for
a
substantially
shorter
period
of
time,
but
my
recollection
is
your
honor
that
the
earliest
cases
approximately
1930
that's
cited
in
the
reports.
most
of
the
raidiing,
if
that?s
what
one
can
call
that
has
gone
in
new
york,
went
on
during
the
period
when
the
american
labor
party
disintegrated
into
two
wings,
the
american
labor
party
and
the
liberal
party
at
a
contest
commenced
with
what
had
been
the
constituency
of
the
american
labor
party
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
most
of
the
raidiing
situations
came
up
and
even
in
that
context,
a
heated
political
struggle
between
to
factions,
332
was
utilized
with
great
effectiveness
in
maintaining
the
purity
of
both
political
parties.
mr.
burt
neuborne
section
186,
your
honor?
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir.
the
statutory
scheme
of
having
an
enrollment
box
which
is
open
once
a
year,
i
have
traced
back
to
1898.
it
is
in
the
codification
of
the
election
law
in
1909
that
has
been
continued
forward
to
the
present
time.
chief
judge
mishler
writing
in
the
district
court
noted
the
effectiveness
of
section
332
as
a
device
to
guard
against
party
raidiing
and
i
note
in
passing
that
chief
judge
mishler
spoke
with
a
great
deal
of
experience
before
his
elevation
to
the
bench
in
1961,
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
queens
county
republican
party
and
had
been
its
candidate
for
public
office
on
a
number
of
occasions,
is
familiar
with
the
operation
of
the
political
process
in
new
york
and
recognized
section
332
for
what
it
is,
a
very
effective
device
to
guard
against
bad
faith
raidiing.
a
second
less
drastic
alternative
open
to
new
york
would
be
to
apply
these
restrictive
affiliation
rules
only
to
those
political
parties
who
want
them.
in
other
words,
if
a
party
thinks
that
it
is
some
way
being
endangered,
it
could,
i
suppose
new
york
could
if
it
wished
to
setup
a
statutory
scheme
that
allowed
a
party
some
option
in
protecting
itself.
new
york
has
not
chosen
to
do
this,
has
chosen
instead
to
impose
these
restrictive
rules
on
parties
whether
or
not
they
wish
them
and
indeed
in
this
particular
case,
the
democratic
party
went
to
court
to
say
precisely
that
it
didn?t
want
them
and
nevertheless,
was
forced
to
live
with
them.
the
third
less
drastic
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
not
sir.
i
think
the
first
answer
is
that,
if
that?s
what
is
necessary
to
permit
persons
to
vote,
the
fact
that
it
would
be
administratively
more
difficult
to
operate
would
not
be
a
sufficient
justification
for
not
utilizing
it,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
wouldn't
--
that
it
would
create
substantial
administrative
problems
because
it
would
be
perfectly
possible.
we
only
have
--
we
four
parties
in
new
york
state,
the
republican,
the
democratic,
liberal
and
conservative.
it
would
be
perfectly
feasible
if
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
wished
to
permit
those
parties
to
opt
for
some
form
of
differed
enrollment
process
and
simply
have
the
registrars
make
the
entries
as
to
who
is
a
party
member
at
the
point
in
time
which
the
political
party
wished.
in
other
words,
those
parties
which
did
not
opt
would
have
the
entries
immediately.
those
parties
which
did
opt
could
if
they
wished,
have
the
material
in
the
enrollment
box
for
a
period
of
time,
but
the
same
number
of
entries
would
have
to
be
made
by
the
administrative
officials.
it
would
simply
be
making
them
over
a
longer
period
of
time,
indeed,
it
might
your
honor,
it
might
be
administratively
easier
to
do
it
this
way
because
the
way
the
system
works
now
all
party
enrollments
in
a
year
must
be
entered
by
the
officials
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
as
soon
as
the
enrollment
box
is
open
in
mid
november,
every
enrollment
that?s
been
made
during
a
preceding
year
must
be
entered
within
a
very
short
time,
creating
a
very
serious
administrative
backlog
for
the
process.
part
of
the
option
might
have
the
effect
of
spreading
it
out
over
a
longer
period
of
time
and
making
it
administratively
more
workable.
i
do
not
suggest
that
i?m
in
favor
of
the
party
option.
i
merely
pose
it
to
the
court
as
a
possible
less
drastic
alternative
which
new
york
could
have
utilized.
a
third
less
drastic
alternative
which
we
discussed
earlier
was
the
application
of
this
particular
statute
to
the
class
which
even
arguably
the
only
class
which
even
arguably
posses
a
danger
of
raidiing
and
that?s
those
persons
who
have
a
preexisting
party
affiliation
and
who
are
seeking
to
alter
that
preexisting
party
affiliation.
every
single
instance
of
raidiing
which
has
been
cited
in
the
new
york
reports
and
which
has
been
discussed
by
the
attorney
general
has
involved
persons
of
a
preexisting
party
affiliation
attempting
to
alter
that
affiliation
to
participate
in
the
affairs
of
another
party.
indeed,
no
other
state
except
new
york
has
found
it
necessary
to
apply
these
types
of
restrictions
to
persons
seeking
to
newly
affiliate
with
a
political
party.
in
city
of
phoenix
versus
kolodziejski,
mr.
justice
white
writing
for
this
court
noted
that
it
would
not
be
permissible
for
a
state
to
base
electoral
restrictions
upon
a
hypothetical
possibility
not
reasonably
likely
to
occur
and
in
that
case,
he
pointed
out
that
only
14
other
states
had
similar
restrictions
upon
the
franchise.
well,
this
case
is
even
dramatically
more
insubstantial,
in
that
no
other
state
has
seen
fit
to
impose
this
type
of
restriction
upon
persons
attempting
to
affiliate
with
a
political
party
for
the
first
time.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
don?t
clam
to
be
an
expert
on
the
political
party
structure
of
the
other
49
states
but
i
would
be
surprised
if
there
were
not
minority
parties
in
other
states
as
well.
if
ohio,
illinois,
california,
pennsylvania
can
get
along
without
this
type
of
restriction
applied
to
newly
enrolled
persons
seeking
to
merely
to
register
their
initial
party
affiliation,
it?s
inconceivable
to
know
that
new
york
requires
this
type
of
drastic,
drastic
restriction
which
has
the
effect
of
barring
persons
in
the
similarly
situated
from
the
petitioners
from
participating
in
the
primary
despite
the
fact
that
they
tried
to
enroll
in
that
primary
over
six
months
before
it
was
held.
the
fourth
less
drastic
alternative
would
be
a
reliance
upon
the
loyalty
oath
which
new
york
state
currently
requires
persons
attempting
to
enroll
in
political
party
to
sign.
in
order
to
enroll
in
a
political
party
in
new
york,
one
must
file
a
solemn
declaration
of
adherence
to
party
principle
and
a
solemn
declaration
of
intention
to
support
the
nominees
of
the
party
at
the
next
general
election.
that
requirement
forbids
casual
party
affiliation
in
new
york
and
it
has
the
effect
of
making
it
virtually
impossible
for
large
casual
party
switches
to
occur.
in
other
words,
we
must
assume
if
there
was
to
be
an
evil
in
new
york
state
that
persons
will
fraudulently
execute
this
affiliation,
these
enrollment
blanks
and
it
is
we
believe
inconceivable
to
think
that
large
scale
fraudulence
switching
will
occur.
finally,
if
large
scale
fraudulence
switching
does
occur
in
violation
of
the
party
loyalty
oaths,
new
york
maintains
a
comprehensive
system
of
criminal
sanctions
for
fraudulent
participation
in
the
electoral
process
which
is
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
dunn
versus
blumstein
can
be
used
effectively
to
guard
against
fraud.
so
that
really
what
new
york
has
done
here
has
not
used
the
least
drastic
alternative.
the
only
way
to
describe
what
they?ve
done
is
they?ve
used
the
most
drastic
possible
alternative
to
deal
with
this
problem
and
they
therefore,
and
in
so
doing
have
unnecessarily
disenfranchised
thousands
and
thousands
of
new
yorkers.
even
if
this
case
did
not
involve
voting
rights,
even
if
it
did
not
involve
a
delusion
of
the
franchise
and
the
triggering
of
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
it
would
never
the
less
raise
the
most
serious
questions
under
the
association
freedoms
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
because
the
effect
of
new
york
statutory
scheme
is
to
create
a
waiting
period
which
forces
persons
attempting
to
join
a
political
party
to
wait
as
long
as
14
months
before
they?re
accepted
into
that
party.
now,
the
right
to
join,
the
right
to
associate
with
the
political
party
for
the
advancement
of
common
beliefs
is
the
core
association
of
freedom
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
it
is
the
most
important
association
of
freedom
we
have.
now,
before
new
york
can
impose
this
type
of
drastic
and
unique
interference
with
the
operation
of
that
associational
freedom,
it
must
come
forward
and
demonstrate
some
overwriting
societal
interest
which
can
be
advanced
by
no
less
drastic
means.
that
is
precisely
the
test
that
mr.
justice
harland
used
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
williams
versus
rhodes
when
he
analyzed
the
impact
of
the
ohio
election
law
and
ruled
that
it
had
an
impermissible
constitutional
effect
upon
persons
attempting
to
associate
for
the
advancement
of
common
political
goals
in
ohio.
we
suggest
that
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
test,
the
constitutional
test
which
mr.
justice
harland
utilized
in
williams
versus
rhodes
is
very
similar
in
operation
and
effect
to
the
compelling
state
interest
test
which
mr.
justice
marshall
utilized
in
dunn
versus
blumstein.
they
worked
very,
very
similarly.
they
come
out
just
about
the
same
and
they
do
because
they
are
both
designed
to
protect
the
single
most
important
values
that
we
can
possibly
have
in
a
democracy
which
is
the
right
to
participate
in
the
political
process
by
which
our
leaders
are
chosen.
that
is
an
ultimate
first
amendment
right
as
well
as
the
right
to
vote.
and
we
suggest
therefore
that
even
if
as
mr.
justice
harland
did
in
williams
versus
rhodes,
even
if
one
is
to
choose
the
crime
where
evans
versus
cornman
done
a
line
of
authority
and
analyses
this
case
solely
as
an
association
of
freedom
test.
the
interests
which
new
state
has
advanced
are
far,
far
less
compelling
than
most
which
this
court
has
rejected
in
association
with
freedom
cases
in
the
past.
if
i
may
your
honor,
i?d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir.
the
friedman
case
your
honor
was
here
prior
to
this
case,
however,
two
distinguishing
characteristics
existed
in
friedman
case.
first,
friedman
was
attempting
to
be
a
candidate
similar
to
the
lippitt
situation
where
the
candidate
in
lippitt
was
attempting
to
run
not
vote
and
as
the
chief
justice
noted
in
bullock
versus
carter,
the
right
to
become
a
candidate
maybe
very
different
than
the
right
to
actually
vote
in
a
particular
election.
secondly,
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
know
of
no
provision
that
deals
only
with
candidates
so
assume
it
was
this.
mr.
burt
neuborne
secondly,
a
more
importantly
your
honor,
i
suggest
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
to
a
person
who
wished
to
become
a
candidate.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
the
major
distinction
that
i
have
with
that
case
is
that
the
record
in
that
case
indicated
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
question
as
to
the
good
fate
of
mr.
friedman?s
residence
and
in
fact
there
was
an
adequate
state
ground
upon
which
the
state
court
pass
on
that
case,
that
there
was
serious
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
address
from
which
he
was
attempting
to
enroll.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
i
understand
that
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
there
were
serious
statements
by
the
state
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
that
is
correct
sir.
however,
i
wish
to
reiteraid
that
that
was
again
a
candidate
case
very
much
as
lippitt
was
a
candidate
case.
more
importantly
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
but
his
right
to
become
a
candidate
triggered
the
particular
test
that
the
court
was
utilizing
at
that
time.
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
bullock,
a
very
different
set
of
considerations
come
into
play
when
the
person?s
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
i?m
frankly
troubled
by
that
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
was
troubled
by
the
distinction
in
lippitt
however,
it
is
a
distinction
which
has
been
made
by
this
court
and
which
does
distinguish
the
friedman
case.
briefly,
i?d
wish
to
point
out
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
could
have
registered
during
the
brief
period
between
the
time
of
twenty-sixth
amendment
was
ratified
in
june
of
1971
and
the
close
of
registration
in
new
york
in
october
of
1971,
but
they
would
have
been
registering
in
connection
with
elections
in
new
york
state
where
the
highest
office
at
stake
was
that
at
county
executive
and
where
they
turn
out
was
exceptionally
law
simply
because
there
were
no
significant
issues
presented
to
the
electoraid
at
that
time.
indeed,
the
turnout
was
so
low
that
vast
bulk
of
persons
who
registered
under
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
did
so
after
the
1971
general
election.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no
sir,
i
don?t
think
its
inadvertence,
judge
dooling
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
your
honor,
where
the
highest
office
at
stake
was
that
of
county
executive.
in
the
particular
primary
where
they
sought
to
enroll,
they
were
attempting
to
participate
in
a
presidential
primary
in
new
york.
judge
dooking
in
a
related
case
noted
that
you
can
swim
365
days
a
year
but
you
only
do
it
when
its
hot
and
that
is
a,
you
can
register
quite
often
but
you
only
do
it
when
the
political
season
begins
to
heat
up
and
this,
i
submit
to
you
that
these
petitioners
attempted
to
register
to
vote
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
that
maybe
so
your
honor,
yes
sir
but
again
you
only
raid
i
submit
if
you?re
moving
to
one
party
to
another.
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh,
no
question
about
it
sir,
it
would
have
been
virtually
impossible
for
large
numbers
of
peoples
?-
mr.
burt
neuborne
well
your
honor,
we
move
this
expeditiously
as
possible.
the
case
was
decided,
the
case
was
filed
immediately
after
they
were
denied
their
enrollment.
it
was
decided
by
judge
mishler
within
three
weeks,
it
then
went
up
on
an
expeditor
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
where
it
was
argued
on
february
24,
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
april
24,
we
lodged
a
certiorari
petition
that
same
day
with
this
court
and
move
for
a
stay,
the
stay
was
temporarily
granted
by
mr.
justice
marshall
on
the
26th
so
that
i
think
that
petitioners
move
as
absolutely
as
expeditiously
as
they
could.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir.
thank
you
your
honors.
