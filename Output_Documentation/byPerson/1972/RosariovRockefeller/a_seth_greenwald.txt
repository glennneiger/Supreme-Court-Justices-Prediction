mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
considering
this
case,
i
think
that
there?s
a
certain
similarity
to
the
previous
case
argued
here
if
the
both
of
us
are
quaint
to
professional
sports.
seem
to
me,
the
previous
case
concerned
itself
with
what
california
can
do
to
stop
the
pirates
and
the
present
case
involves
what
new
york
can
do
to
stop
the
raidiings.
the
statute
in
question,
new
york
state
election
law
section
186,
the
enrollment
box
statute
simply
provides
that
enrollment
blanks
in
party
are
placed
in
a
box
and
are
removed
after
the
general
election.
what
this
means
as
has
been
pointed
out
is
that
for
an
enrollment
to
be
effective
of
the
primary
next
succeeding,
it
has
to
be
done
before
the
general
election.
if
it?s
done
after
the
general
election,
it
is
differed
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
new
york
has
in
section
196,
a
general
rule
that
provides
the
registrations,
excuse
me,
enrollments
must
be
accomplished
before
the
general
election
to
avoid
the
danger
of
raidiing.
however,
the
next
section
of
the
law,
special
enrollments
provides
that
persons
who
have
reached
voting
age
after
the
general
election
can
get
a
special
enrollment
and
immediately
enrolling
in
a
party
up
to
30
days
before
the
primary.
there
are
number
of
other
exceptions
provided
in
section
187.
another
one
is
if
a
person
did
not
have
residency
requirements
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
general
election,
however,
once
again,
there?s
a
further
restriction
there
and
subdivision
6
of
187
that
is
restricted
to
the
same
county
as
the
person
resided
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
general
election.
so
i
think
that
new
york
has
shown
that
is
not
opposed
per
se
to
later
enrollments.
it
is
concerned
with
the
danger
of
raidiing
and
in
protecting
party
integrity
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
these
named
plaintiffs
are
voters
who
were
eligible
and
could
have
been
effectively
enrolled
in
a
party
before
the
proceeding
general
election
but
failed
to
do
so
for
unstated
reasons.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
they
never
had
been
enrolled,
that
is
correct.
and
the
point
is
that
the---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
they
can
be
because
new
york
is
concerned
with
non
party
votes
being
cast
in
a
party
primary
for
purposes
and
amicable
to
the
party
and
there
is
the
same
danger
with
the
independent
and
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
an
independent
is
one
of
the
major
political
blocks
of
american
political
life
and
independent
is
material
for
a
raid
also
just
as
people
who?ve
actually
enrolled
in
another
political
party.
i
think
that
it?s
quite
apparent
that
in
many
situations,
if
a
party
is
engaging
in
raidiing,
it?s
not
going
to
stop
just
with
its
own
members
for
the
raid,
it
also
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
these
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
was
ratified
in
the
summer
of
1971
i
believe
july.
at
that
time,
anyone
who
was
in
franchise
by
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
was
eligible
to
register
and
enroll
in
a
political
party
in
the
state
of
new
york.
if
they
failed
to
do
so
by
as
would
anyone
else
in
the
state
of
new
york,
if
they
fail
to
do
so
by
the
general
election
of--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
71,
they
were
not
enrolled
in
a
party
to
vote
in
the
1972
primary.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
specially
enrolled
under
section
187,
there
is
an
exception.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
this
group
could
not
because
it
had
not
availed
itself
of
the
statutory
obligation
to
enroll
in
the
party
which
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that?s
stipulated.
there
is
no
argument
that
these
named
plaintiffs,
the
petition
is
involved
here
just
simply
fail
to
take
the
opportunity
which
is
available
to
every
voter
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
enroll
in
a
political
party
timely
and
avoid
the
dangers
of
raidiing.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
that
is
part
of
it
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeal?s
opinion
addresses
itself
to
why
we
have
the
date
of
the
general
election
as
the
operative
date,
it
has
to
be
done
before
the
general
election
and
that
is
simply
that
before
the
general
election
would
be
the
rare
politician
that
would
encourage
a
voter
to
vote
for
his
party
at
the
general
election
but
enroll
in
another
party.
but
after
the
general
election,
no
such
deter
would
be
present.
he
doesn?t
have
to
put
himself
in
that
type
of
unseemly
incongruous
position.
and
i
have
indicated
that
we
are
seeking
to
discourage
raidiing.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
new
york
primary
was
june
28,
1972
this
year.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
at
that
time,
there
were
nominations
for
federal
officers
and
state
office
such
as
the
assembly
and
state
senate
involved,
yes.
there
was
state
offices
involved
also.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
to
join
justice
rehnquist,
to
join
it
in
a
raid
on
another
party,
i
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
day
and
age
when
we
have
a
lot
of
well
organized
independent
and
extensively
nonpolitical
groups
which
at
perhaps
primary
time
have
political
interest
say
to
defeat
a
candidate,
they
also
would
encourage
people
to
enroll
in
a
party
independent
to
other
party
members
to
defeat
a
candidate
who
is
adverse
to
the
interest
they
care
to
advance
and
i
think
once
again
that
this
is
destructive
of
the
political
party
processes
we
know
it.
new
york
of
course
has
a
close
primary
system,
close
primary
as
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
precisely,
it
can
work
both
ways.
i
think
in
the
past
year---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
and
it?s
not
an
issue
of
who?s
got
the
advantage
at
one
particular
time.
i
think
there
is
a
clear
compelling
state
interest
in
preventing
this
time
of
activity
from
occurring
and
certainly
section
186
is
an
affective
means
of
doing
it.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
basically
the
generally
accepted
definition.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
contend
that---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
they
were
not
ever
in
any
other
party.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
say
that
when
a
person
has
failed
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
timely
enroll
when
at
the
time
the
proceeding
general
election
he
failed
to
indicate
that
he
was
say
a
democrat
when
he
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so
that
when
he
later
seeks
to
in
effect
change
his
status---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
change
his
status,
his
political
status.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
from
independent
to
say
democrat
that
is
as
much
a
change
of
political
affiliation
is
when
someone
is
a
republican
and
seeks
to
change
it
to
democratic.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
question
of
why
people
don?t
vote
is
of
course
hotly
contested
matter,
a
lot
of
people
feel
that
it?s
simply
a
matter
of
apathy.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
the
dangers
involved
in
party
raidiing
may
not
be
immediately
presented
by
this
case
but
i
do
submit
that
if
section
186
had
not
been
effect
this
past
year,
there
would
have
been
a
substantial
crossover
vote
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
in
states
where
party
affiliation
restriction
had
been
struck
down
this
spring,
there
was
substantial
crossover
voting
and
none
party
members
voting
and
say
the
democratic
primary.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
understand
the
class
that?s
involved.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
there?s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
particular
petitions
were
crossover
voters
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
however
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
that
that
certainly
is
the
case.
we
have
here
a
statute
that
directs
itself
equally
at
an
evil.
it
places
the
same
requirements
on
all
voters
generally.
you
put
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
you
mean
the
one
past
june?
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
the
june
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
at
the
time
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
that
when
this
case
came
up
here
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
political
organization
lawyers
from
a
governed
file
the
brief
amicus
curiae.
it?s
interesting
that
today
they
didn?t
file
a
brief
on
the
actual
case,
they---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
it
shows
where
their
concern
is
at
one
particular
primary
in
the
personality
of
one
particular
candidate
or
perhaps
one
particular
issue
and
i
think
the
argument
that
the
petition
is
made
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
join
a
party
to
advance
the
interest
of
a
particular
candidate
or
a
particular
issue
strikes
at
the
heart
of
our
political
party
system
which
contemplates
the
people
joining
the
political
party
because
they
generally
attuned
to
the
basic
theories
of
government
of
the
party.
now,
once
again,
i
recognized
that
our
political
parties
are
fluid
in
the
united
states
and
i
think
that?s
the
beauty
of
the
differed
enrollment
system,
a
person
who
joins
the
democratic
party
in
a
national
election
year
such
as
this
year
could
effectively
join
say
the
liberal
party
for
a
municipal
election
which
is
coming
up
next
year
and
in
the
following
year,
join
the
republican
party
for
the
state
election
if
he
feels
the
issues
are
different.
now,
i
don?t
think
there
are
too
many
people
who
do
this
but
the
opportunity
is
available.
all
new
york
state
asks
is
that
the
person
do
this
at
the
proper
time
to
avoid
the
danger
of
raidiing
or
short
notice
takeover
a
political
parties.
and
involved
herein
is
the
integrity
of
the
close
party
primary
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
includes
not
just
democratic
and
republican
parties
but
rather
the
two
other
minor
parties,
the
conservative
and
liberal
parties
which
have
very
limited
enrollments
and
especially
when
you
get
down
to
an
assembly
district
basis
primaries
in
two
minor
parties
can
be
controlled
by
very
few
votes.
it?s
very
easy
to
take
them
over
with
members
of
other
political
parties
or
for
that
matter
well
organized
independents
with
interest
and
typical
to
the
political
party.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i?ve
checked
the
statutes
of
other
states.
kentucky
has
a
similar
system
as
to
people
who
have
affiliated
with
the
party,
you
cannot
switch
your
party
enrollment
between
the
periods
of
the
general
election
in
the
primary.
and
also
from
my
reading
of
the
kentucky
statute
would
say
that
this
would
include
anyone
who
registered
to
vote
by
failed
to
enroll
in
a
party.
however,
there
is
a
provision
as
it
said
for
new
registrants.
i
do
think
though
that
most
dates
or
a
goodly
number
of
states
are
trying
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
as
the
state
of
new
york
is
trying
to
accomplish
here
to
reduce
the
possibility
of
party
raidiing
and
the
fact
that
section
186
is
an
effective
means
of
doing
it
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
pointed
out
does
not
mean
that
it
is
in
an
improper
means.
and
i
think
this
brings
us
to
the
issue
of
just
what
is
the
nature
of
primary?
and
a
primary
is
not
a
general
election.
it
is
setup
to
allow
party
members
to
select
their
candidates
and
as
such
it
replaces
caucus
or
a
convention
and
the
vote
is
properly
limited
to
party
members
and
if
you
don?t
close
your
primary
and
some
states
don?t
close
them,
you
have
the
possibility,
indeed,
the
probability
of
raids.
i
think
this
is
demonstrated,
its
always
been
the
case
in
states
such
as
wisconsin,
what
happen
to
the
spring
is
instructive
and
i
would
submit
that
state
has
the
discretion
to
define
the
constituency
of
a
political
party
so
long
as
the
definition
does
not
permanently
exclude
anyone
who
may
wish
to
be
represented
and
that?s
exactly
what
is
done
here.
the
enrollment
is
taken
but
it
is
differed.
now,
we
have
i
think
at
this
point,
i
have
contended
that
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
apply
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
i
would
contend
that
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
is
perfectly
applicable
to
this
type
of
control
of
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
this
is
not
a
disenfranchising
statute
and
i
think
the
fact
that
it
applies
to
all
vote
is
equally
in
primary
voting
is
indicative
that
you
can
apply
the
rational
basis
test.
however,
and
i?m
all
aware
that
this
case
has
always
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
we
have
another
standard
and
i
think
it?s
called
perhaps
the
close
scrutiny
because
allegedly
fundamental
rights
are
involved.
once
again,
this
statute
has
withstood
close
scrutiny
and
the
statute
has
an
important
purpose
and
especially
because
it?s
a
primary
case
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
oh
yes,
it?s
been
on
that,
i
think
i?d
even
say
a
little
longer
than
mr.
neuborne
has
but
the
basic
point
is
that
since
the
beginning
of
the
primary
system
in
new
york,
we
have
had
this
differed
enrollment
system
and
i
think
that?s
instructive
if
you
know
probably
of
you
do,
some
of
the
political
history
the
state
of
new
york,
it
has
been
filled
with
a
lot
of
political
shenanigans
and
backroom
tactics
and
i
think
that
the
desire
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
preserve
party
integrity
to
avoid
unseemly
electoral
practices
is
perfectly
proper.
however,
if
we
have
to
meet
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
i
think
we
have
to
go
no
further
then
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
i
don?t
think
there?s
too
much
dispute
at
this
point
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
in
preserving
party
integrities
and
avoiding
raids.
and
as
such,
the
statute
achieve
its
ends
by
the
least
drastic
means.
i
object
to
this
test
because
theirs
is
a,
the
chief
justice
has
said
in
very
short
past
that
this
tests
demands
perfection
and
yet
still
186
has
met
this
test,
it
meets
it
because
the
suggested
alternatives
are
not
truly
viable
when
you
consider
the
dangers
of
large
scale
raidiing.
the
discussion
of
the
party
dis-enrollment
statutes
section
332
demonstraids
as
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
it
is
in
ultimately
time
consuming
and
ineffective,
it
would
be
ineffective
in
space
of
large
scale
raidiing,
the
point
being
of
course
in
the
course
of
the
cases
that
with
186,
you
don?t
have
too
many
332
cases.
the
fact
is
the
332
is
simply
supplement
to
section
186
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
if
we
had
to
rely
solely
in
332,
we?d
have
a
much
more
serious
infringement
to
first
amendment
rights
with
the
courts
inquiring
into
voters
political
belief
and
the
genuineness
of
those
beliefs
which
is
avoided
with
section
186.
and
as
to
this
alleged
infringement
of
first
amendment
rights,
it
should
be
noted
as
the
court
said
below,
186
is
designed
to
minimally
infringe
on
first
amendment
right.
a
person
has
the
right
enroll
in
a
party;
these
petitioners
have
the
right
to
enroll
in
a
party.
you
can
change
a
party
and
never
loss
a
primary
vote
which
is
a
distinction
from
a
number
of
other
post
primary
restrictions
that
we
instructed
down.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
that?s
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
who
may?
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
section
187
of
new
york?s
election
law
provides
a
number
of
categories.
if
i
could,
it
states,
the
subdivision
to
a
person
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
right
after
section
186,
i
don?t
believe
it?s
in
the
appendix
but
it
is
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
some
of
the
exceptions
of
187
are
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
one
of
the
exceptions
is
that
as
i
have
alluded
to
before,
person
who
became
of
age
after
the
proceeding
general
election,
person
who
became
naturalized,
person
who
didn?t
have
the
necessary
residential
qualifications
although
once
again,
i?d
direct
if
you
have
the
statute,
there?s
a
further
exception
in
subdivision
6
which
limits
that
to
the
same
county.
a
person
who
is
in
the
service
of
the
military
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
general
election
or
enrollment
time
and
a
person
who
was
in
a
veterans?
bureau
hospital
and
also
spouses
or
children
or
person
who
is
incapacitated
by
illness
during
the
proceeding
general
election.
these
are
all
people
who
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
he
goes
to
the
board
of
elections
within
at
least
30
days
before
the
primary
because
registration
enrollment
stops
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
and
he
gets
a
special
enrollment
and
he?s
immediately
enrolled
in
political
party
and
can
vote
in
the
primary.
and
i
think
that
it?s
instructive
when
you
talk
about
first
amendment
rights
that
if
a
four
year
restriction
on
a
person
who
voted
in
the
primary
of
another
party
from
being
a
candidate
of
the
second
party
is
not
an
unjust
infringement
to
first
amendment
right
as
was
affirmed
by
this
court
and
lippitt
against
cipollone
then
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
much
lower
restriction
or
whatever
requirements
of
section
186,
are
not
anymore
offensive
to
the
first
amendment,
they?re
amply
justified
by
the
situation
involved
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes
and
what
i
point
out
that
i
think
it
has
been
said
by
the
chief
justice
in
bullock
against
carter,
the
rights
of
voters
and
candidates
don?t
lend
themselves
to
neat
separation.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
is
as
much
a
first
amendment
right
as
the
right
to
be
the
right
to
vote.
they
are
both
encompassed
in
the
political
rights
of
citizens.
i
think
also
as
instructed
that
new
york
has
a
history
of
allowing
party
switches.
186
is
not
a
serious
bar,
if
we
look
back
to
1971,
the
situation
with
mayor
john
lindsay
who
changed
from
the
republican
to
democratic
party
and
then
proceeded
to
seek
the
democratic
nomination.
if
we
look
then
we
also,
even
during
the
period
when
section
186
would
differs
enrollment.
congressman
ogden
reid
switched
from
the
republican
to
democratic
party.
these
switches
are
made
in
good
fate
and
as
has
been
shown,
section
186
is
not
a
bar
to
such
switches
of
political
affiliation.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i?m
giving
this
example
to
demonstraid
that
section
186
does
not
prevent
the
honest
trustworthy
citizen
from
exercising
his
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
believe---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
section
187---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i?m
not
acquainted,
i?ll
accept
that.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
state
of
new
york
in
section
187
has
made
certain
exceptions.
they
feel
that
these
people
who
hadn?t
had
an
opportunity,
certainly
they
couldn?t
have
enrolled
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
general
election
should
have
an
opportunity
to
especially
enroll.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
don?t
say
that
as
raidiing,
it
maybe,
it
might
possibly
be
but
it?s
not
a
serious
nature.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
as
the
supplement
of
the
dis-enrollment
statute
section
332
could
be
applied
if
that
could
be
shown
to
be
raidiing.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
section
332
of
the
election
law,
the
dis-enrollments
statute
your
honor.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
if
they
were
drawn
that
it
was
raidiing,
i
doubt
if
in
such
a
situation
if
it
could
conceivably
be
raidiing
if
a
person
had
just
been
naturalized.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
raidiing
is
not
the
defined
in
the
statute
your
honor.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
doubt
if
anything
effectively
could
be
done.
the
final
thing
i?d
like
to
allot
to
is
the
injection
of
the
durational
residency
question
into
this
case,
i
do
not
think
it
is
present.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
instant
petitioner
is
the
people
involved
here
never
lacked
residency.
certainly
as
to
them,
they
are
not
being
subjected
to
a
durational
residency
requirement.
furthermore,
if
there
was
such
as
petitioner
in
this
case,
a
person
who
would
move
into
county
or
from
out
of
state,
there?s
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
there?s
another
section
of
the
law
that
they?ve
be
attacking
namely
187
subdivision
six.
and
to
that
extent,
it
seems
to
me
that
interest
of
that
class
and
my
adversary
has
pointed
out
to
the
various
classes
possibly
involved
although
we
don?t
have
one
class
in
this
case.
as
to
that
class,
the
interest
of
the
class,
the
petitioners
represent
are
antagonistic,
it?s
a
different
case
and
it
seems
that
the
statute
clearly
is
not
a
durational
residency
requirement,
does
not
by
its
very
terms
requires
someone
be
a
resident
of
the
state
for
a
certain
period
of
time
before
he
can
enroll
in
a
party
and
i
think
that
it?s
a
essentially
not
in
the
case.
in
summary,
i
think
it
can
fairly
be
stated
that
section
186
is
a
reasonable
statute
for
filling
a
compelling
state
interest
by
the
least
drastic
effective
means.
it
is
submitted
that
it
has
a
minimal
effect
on
first
amendment
rights
and
it
is
not
a
durational
residency
requirement
or
there?s
another
argument,
a
grandfather
clause,
there?s
no
racial
motivation
in
this
case.
if
not
a
grandfather
clause,
it?s
the
young
voters
indeed
we
do
have
an
exception
for
young
voters
who
come
of
age.
it
was
not
in
the
complaint
that
any
allegations
of
racial
discrimination
and
i
think
the
decision
in
a
welfare
case,
jefferson
against
hackney,
a
very
recent
decision
of
this
court
clearly
demonstraids
that
the
possible
greater
effect
on
a
racial
minority
or
an
age
minority
is
no
proof
of
the
fact
that
its
racially
discriminatory
law.
and
furthermore,
there?s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
and
at
this
point,
i
will
rest.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
was
this
question
here
before?
i
have
made
an
argument
that
there
were
appeals
from
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
which
did
involve
section
186
and
differing
of
enrollment
that
were
appealed
to
this
court,
i
think
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
contended
that
it
did
raise
the
question.
there
was
also
the
case
of
the
georgia
voter
who
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
friedman,
one
of
the
co-counsel
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
fact,
friedman
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
issue
was
that
mr.
friedman
could
not
be
a
candidate
for
congress
because
his
enrollment
was
differed
due
to
a
late
transfer
of
enrollment
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
believe
it
did
and
this
court
dismiss
for
lack
of
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
considering
this
case,
i
think
that
there?s
a
certain
similarity
to
the
previous
case
argued
here
if
the
both
of
us
are
quaint
to
professional
sports.
seem
to
me,
the
previous
case
concerned
itself
with
what
california
can
do
to
stop
the
pirates
and
the
present
case
involves
what
new
york
can
do
to
stop
the
raidiings.
the
statute
in
question,
new
york
state
election
law
section
186,
the
enrollment
box
statute
simply
provides
that
enrollment
blanks
in
party
are
placed
in
a
box
and
are
removed
after
the
general
election.
what
this
means
as
has
been
pointed
out
is
that
for
an
enrollment
to
be
effective
of
the
primary
next
succeeding,
it
has
to
be
done
before
the
general
election.
if
it?s
done
after
the
general
election,
it
is
differed
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
new
york
has
in
section
196,
a
general
rule
that
provides
the
registrations,
excuse
me,
enrollments
must
be
accomplished
before
the
general
election
to
avoid
the
danger
of
raidiing.
however,
the
next
section
of
the
law,
special
enrollments
provides
that
persons
who
have
reached
voting
age
after
the
general
election
can
get
a
special
enrollment
and
immediately
enrolling
in
a
party
up
to
30
days
before
the
primary.
there
are
number
of
other
exceptions
provided
in
section
187.
another
one
is
if
a
person
did
not
have
residency
requirements
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
general
election,
however,
once
again,
there?s
a
further
restriction
there
and
subdivision
6
of
187
that
is
restricted
to
the
same
county
as
the
person
resided
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
general
election.
so
i
think
that
new
york
has
shown
that
is
not
opposed
per
se
to
later
enrollments.
it
is
concerned
with
the
danger
of
raidiing
and
in
protecting
party
integrity
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
these
named
plaintiffs
are
voters
who
were
eligible
and
could
have
been
effectively
enrolled
in
a
party
before
the
proceeding
general
election
but
failed
to
do
so
for
unstated
reasons.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
they
never
had
been
enrolled,
that
is
correct.
and
the
point
is
that
the---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
they
can
be
because
new
york
is
concerned
with
non
party
votes
being
cast
in
a
party
primary
for
purposes
and
amicable
to
the
party
and
there
is
the
same
danger
with
the
independent
and
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
an
independent
is
one
of
the
major
political
blocks
of
american
political
life
and
independent
is
material
for
a
raid
also
just
as
people
who?ve
actually
enrolled
in
another
political
party.
i
think
that
it?s
quite
apparent
that
in
many
situations,
if
a
party
is
engaging
in
raidiing,
it?s
not
going
to
stop
just
with
its
own
members
for
the
raid,
it
also
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
these
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
was
ratified
in
the
summer
of
1971
i
believe
july.
at
that
time,
anyone
who
was
in
franchise
by
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
was
eligible
to
register
and
enroll
in
a
political
party
in
the
state
of
new
york.
if
they
failed
to
do
so
by
as
would
anyone
else
in
the
state
of
new
york,
if
they
fail
to
do
so
by
the
general
election
of--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
71,
they
were
not
enrolled
in
a
party
to
vote
in
the
1972
primary.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
specially
enrolled
under
section
187,
there
is
an
exception.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
this
group
could
not
because
it
had
not
availed
itself
of
the
statutory
obligation
to
enroll
in
the
party
which
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that?s
stipulated.
there
is
no
argument
that
these
named
plaintiffs,
the
petition
is
involved
here
just
simply
fail
to
take
the
opportunity
which
is
available
to
every
voter
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
enroll
in
a
political
party
timely
and
avoid
the
dangers
of
raidiing.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
that
is
part
of
it
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeal?s
opinion
addresses
itself
to
why
we
have
the
date
of
the
general
election
as
the
operative
date,
it
has
to
be
done
before
the
general
election
and
that
is
simply
that
before
the
general
election
would
be
the
rare
politician
that
would
encourage
a
voter
to
vote
for
his
party
at
the
general
election
but
enroll
in
another
party.
but
after
the
general
election,
no
such
deter
would
be
present.
he
doesn?t
have
to
put
himself
in
that
type
of
unseemly
incongruous
position.
and
i
have
indicated
that
we
are
seeking
to
discourage
raidiing.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
new
york
primary
was
june
28,
1972
this
year.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
at
that
time,
there
were
nominations
for
federal
officers
and
state
office
such
as
the
assembly
and
state
senate
involved,
yes.
there
was
state
offices
involved
also.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
to
join
justice
rehnquist,
to
join
it
in
a
raid
on
another
party,
i
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
day
and
age
when
we
have
a
lot
of
well
organized
independent
and
extensively
nonpolitical
groups
which
at
perhaps
primary
time
have
political
interest
say
to
defeat
a
candidate,
they
also
would
encourage
people
to
enroll
in
a
party
independent
to
other
party
members
to
defeat
a
candidate
who
is
adverse
to
the
interest
they
care
to
advance
and
i
think
once
again
that
this
is
destructive
of
the
political
party
processes
we
know
it.
new
york
of
course
has
a
close
primary
system,
close
primary
as
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
precisely,
it
can
work
both
ways.
i
think
in
the
past
year---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
and
it?s
not
an
issue
of
who?s
got
the
advantage
at
one
particular
time.
i
think
there
is
a
clear
compelling
state
interest
in
preventing
this
time
of
activity
from
occurring
and
certainly
section
186
is
an
affective
means
of
doing
it.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
basically
the
generally
accepted
definition.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
contend
that---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
they
were
not
ever
in
any
other
party.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
say
that
when
a
person
has
failed
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
timely
enroll
when
at
the
time
the
proceeding
general
election
he
failed
to
indicate
that
he
was
say
a
democrat
when
he
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so
that
when
he
later
seeks
to
in
effect
change
his
status---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
change
his
status,
his
political
status.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
from
independent
to
say
democrat
that
is
as
much
a
change
of
political
affiliation
is
when
someone
is
a
republican
and
seeks
to
change
it
to
democratic.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
question
of
why
people
don?t
vote
is
of
course
hotly
contested
matter,
a
lot
of
people
feel
that
it?s
simply
a
matter
of
apathy.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
the
dangers
involved
in
party
raidiing
may
not
be
immediately
presented
by
this
case
but
i
do
submit
that
if
section
186
had
not
been
effect
this
past
year,
there
would
have
been
a
substantial
crossover
vote
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
in
states
where
party
affiliation
restriction
had
been
struck
down
this
spring,
there
was
substantial
crossover
voting
and
none
party
members
voting
and
say
the
democratic
primary.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
understand
the
class
that?s
involved.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
there?s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
particular
petitions
were
crossover
voters
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
however
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
that
that
certainly
is
the
case.
we
have
here
a
statute
that
directs
itself
equally
at
an
evil.
it
places
the
same
requirements
on
all
voters
generally.
you
put
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
you
mean
the
one
past
june?
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
the
june
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
at
the
time
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
that
when
this
case
came
up
here
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
political
organization
lawyers
from
a
governed
file
the
brief
amicus
curiae.
it?s
interesting
that
today
they
didn?t
file
a
brief
on
the
actual
case,
they---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
it
shows
where
their
concern
is
at
one
particular
primary
in
the
personality
of
one
particular
candidate
or
perhaps
one
particular
issue
and
i
think
the
argument
that
the
petition
is
made
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
join
a
party
to
advance
the
interest
of
a
particular
candidate
or
a
particular
issue
strikes
at
the
heart
of
our
political
party
system
which
contemplates
the
people
joining
the
political
party
because
they
generally
attuned
to
the
basic
theories
of
government
of
the
party.
now,
once
again,
i
recognized
that
our
political
parties
are
fluid
in
the
united
states
and
i
think
that?s
the
beauty
of
the
differed
enrollment
system,
a
person
who
joins
the
democratic
party
in
a
national
election
year
such
as
this
year
could
effectively
join
say
the
liberal
party
for
a
municipal
election
which
is
coming
up
next
year
and
in
the
following
year,
join
the
republican
party
for
the
state
election
if
he
feels
the
issues
are
different.
now,
i
don?t
think
there
are
too
many
people
who
do
this
but
the
opportunity
is
available.
all
new
york
state
asks
is
that
the
person
do
this
at
the
proper
time
to
avoid
the
danger
of
raidiing
or
short
notice
takeover
a
political
parties.
and
involved
herein
is
the
integrity
of
the
close
party
primary
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
includes
not
just
democratic
and
republican
parties
but
rather
the
two
other
minor
parties,
the
conservative
and
liberal
parties
which
have
very
limited
enrollments
and
especially
when
you
get
down
to
an
assembly
district
basis
primaries
in
two
minor
parties
can
be
controlled
by
very
few
votes.
it?s
very
easy
to
take
them
over
with
members
of
other
political
parties
or
for
that
matter
well
organized
independents
with
interest
and
typical
to
the
political
party.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i?ve
checked
the
statutes
of
other
states.
kentucky
has
a
similar
system
as
to
people
who
have
affiliated
with
the
party,
you
cannot
switch
your
party
enrollment
between
the
periods
of
the
general
election
in
the
primary.
and
also
from
my
reading
of
the
kentucky
statute
would
say
that
this
would
include
anyone
who
registered
to
vote
by
failed
to
enroll
in
a
party.
however,
there
is
a
provision
as
it
said
for
new
registrants.
i
do
think
though
that
most
dates
or
a
goodly
number
of
states
are
trying
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
as
the
state
of
new
york
is
trying
to
accomplish
here
to
reduce
the
possibility
of
party
raidiing
and
the
fact
that
section
186
is
an
effective
means
of
doing
it
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
pointed
out
does
not
mean
that
it
is
in
an
improper
means.
and
i
think
this
brings
us
to
the
issue
of
just
what
is
the
nature
of
primary?
and
a
primary
is
not
a
general
election.
it
is
setup
to
allow
party
members
to
select
their
candidates
and
as
such
it
replaces
caucus
or
a
convention
and
the
vote
is
properly
limited
to
party
members
and
if
you
don?t
close
your
primary
and
some
states
don?t
close
them,
you
have
the
possibility,
indeed,
the
probability
of
raids.
i
think
this
is
demonstrated,
its
always
been
the
case
in
states
such
as
wisconsin,
what
happen
to
the
spring
is
instructive
and
i
would
submit
that
state
has
the
discretion
to
define
the
constituency
of
a
political
party
so
long
as
the
definition
does
not
permanently
exclude
anyone
who
may
wish
to
be
represented
and
that?s
exactly
what
is
done
here.
the
enrollment
is
taken
but
it
is
differed.
now,
we
have
i
think
at
this
point,
i
have
contended
that
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
apply
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
i
would
contend
that
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
is
perfectly
applicable
to
this
type
of
control
of
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
this
is
not
a
disenfranchising
statute
and
i
think
the
fact
that
it
applies
to
all
vote
is
equally
in
primary
voting
is
indicative
that
you
can
apply
the
rational
basis
test.
however,
and
i?m
all
aware
that
this
case
has
always
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
we
have
another
standard
and
i
think
it?s
called
perhaps
the
close
scrutiny
because
allegedly
fundamental
rights
are
involved.
once
again,
this
statute
has
withstood
close
scrutiny
and
the
statute
has
an
important
purpose
and
especially
because
it?s
a
primary
case
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
oh
yes,
it?s
been
on
that,
i
think
i?d
even
say
a
little
longer
than
mr.
neuborne
has
but
the
basic
point
is
that
since
the
beginning
of
the
primary
system
in
new
york,
we
have
had
this
differed
enrollment
system
and
i
think
that?s
instructive
if
you
know
probably
of
you
do,
some
of
the
political
history
the
state
of
new
york,
it
has
been
filled
with
a
lot
of
political
shenanigans
and
backroom
tactics
and
i
think
that
the
desire
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
preserve
party
integrity
to
avoid
unseemly
electoral
practices
is
perfectly
proper.
however,
if
we
have
to
meet
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
i
think
we
have
to
go
no
further
then
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
i
don?t
think
there?s
too
much
dispute
at
this
point
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
in
preserving
party
integrities
and
avoiding
raids.
and
as
such,
the
statute
achieve
its
ends
by
the
least
drastic
means.
i
object
to
this
test
because
theirs
is
a,
the
chief
justice
has
said
in
very
short
past
that
this
tests
demands
perfection
and
yet
still
186
has
met
this
test,
it
meets
it
because
the
suggested
alternatives
are
not
truly
viable
when
you
consider
the
dangers
of
large
scale
raidiing.
the
discussion
of
the
party
dis-enrollment
statutes
section
332
demonstraids
as
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
it
is
in
ultimately
time
consuming
and
ineffective,
it
would
be
ineffective
in
space
of
large
scale
raidiing,
the
point
being
of
course
in
the
course
of
the
cases
that
with
186,
you
don?t
have
too
many
332
cases.
the
fact
is
the
332
is
simply
supplement
to
section
186
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
if
we
had
to
rely
solely
in
332,
we?d
have
a
much
more
serious
infringement
to
first
amendment
rights
with
the
courts
inquiring
into
voters
political
belief
and
the
genuineness
of
those
beliefs
which
is
avoided
with
section
186.
and
as
to
this
alleged
infringement
of
first
amendment
rights,
it
should
be
noted
as
the
court
said
below,
186
is
designed
to
minimally
infringe
on
first
amendment
right.
a
person
has
the
right
enroll
in
a
party;
these
petitioners
have
the
right
to
enroll
in
a
party.
you
can
change
a
party
and
never
loss
a
primary
vote
which
is
a
distinction
from
a
number
of
other
post
primary
restrictions
that
we
instructed
down.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
that?s
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
who
may?
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
section
187
of
new
york?s
election
law
provides
a
number
of
categories.
if
i
could,
it
states,
the
subdivision
to
a
person
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
right
after
section
186,
i
don?t
believe
it?s
in
the
appendix
but
it
is
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
some
of
the
exceptions
of
187
are
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
one
of
the
exceptions
is
that
as
i
have
alluded
to
before,
person
who
became
of
age
after
the
proceeding
general
election,
person
who
became
naturalized,
person
who
didn?t
have
the
necessary
residential
qualifications
although
once
again,
i?d
direct
if
you
have
the
statute,
there?s
a
further
exception
in
subdivision
6
which
limits
that
to
the
same
county.
a
person
who
is
in
the
service
of
the
military
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
general
election
or
enrollment
time
and
a
person
who
was
in
a
veterans?
bureau
hospital
and
also
spouses
or
children
or
person
who
is
incapacitated
by
illness
during
the
proceeding
general
election.
these
are
all
people
who
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
he
goes
to
the
board
of
elections
within
at
least
30
days
before
the
primary
because
registration
enrollment
stops
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
and
he
gets
a
special
enrollment
and
he?s
immediately
enrolled
in
political
party
and
can
vote
in
the
primary.
and
i
think
that
it?s
instructive
when
you
talk
about
first
amendment
rights
that
if
a
four
year
restriction
on
a
person
who
voted
in
the
primary
of
another
party
from
being
a
candidate
of
the
second
party
is
not
an
unjust
infringement
to
first
amendment
right
as
was
affirmed
by
this
court
and
lippitt
against
cipollone
then
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
much
lower
restriction
or
whatever
requirements
of
section
186,
are
not
anymore
offensive
to
the
first
amendment,
they?re
amply
justified
by
the
situation
involved
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes
and
what
i
point
out
that
i
think
it
has
been
said
by
the
chief
justice
in
bullock
against
carter,
the
rights
of
voters
and
candidates
don?t
lend
themselves
to
neat
separation.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
is
as
much
a
first
amendment
right
as
the
right
to
be
the
right
to
vote.
they
are
both
encompassed
in
the
political
rights
of
citizens.
i
think
also
as
instructed
that
new
york
has
a
history
of
allowing
party
switches.
186
is
not
a
serious
bar,
if
we
look
back
to
1971,
the
situation
with
mayor
john
lindsay
who
changed
from
the
republican
to
democratic
party
and
then
proceeded
to
seek
the
democratic
nomination.
if
we
look
then
we
also,
even
during
the
period
when
section
186
would
differs
enrollment.
congressman
ogden
reid
switched
from
the
republican
to
democratic
party.
these
switches
are
made
in
good
fate
and
as
has
been
shown,
section
186
is
not
a
bar
to
such
switches
of
political
affiliation.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i?m
giving
this
example
to
demonstraid
that
section
186
does
not
prevent
the
honest
trustworthy
citizen
from
exercising
his
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
believe---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
section
187---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i?m
not
acquainted,
i?ll
accept
that.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
state
of
new
york
in
section
187
has
made
certain
exceptions.
they
feel
that
these
people
who
hadn?t
had
an
opportunity,
certainly
they
couldn?t
have
enrolled
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
general
election
should
have
an
opportunity
to
especially
enroll.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
don?t
say
that
as
raidiing,
it
maybe,
it
might
possibly
be
but
it?s
not
a
serious
nature.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well---
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
as
the
supplement
of
the
dis-enrollment
statute
section
332
could
be
applied
if
that
could
be
shown
to
be
raidiing.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
section
332
of
the
election
law,
the
dis-enrollments
statute
your
honor.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
if
they
were
drawn
that
it
was
raidiing,
i
doubt
if
in
such
a
situation
if
it
could
conceivably
be
raidiing
if
a
person
had
just
been
naturalized.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
raidiing
is
not
the
defined
in
the
statute
your
honor.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
doubt
if
anything
effectively
could
be
done.
the
final
thing
i?d
like
to
allot
to
is
the
injection
of
the
durational
residency
question
into
this
case,
i
do
not
think
it
is
present.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
instant
petitioner
is
the
people
involved
here
never
lacked
residency.
certainly
as
to
them,
they
are
not
being
subjected
to
a
durational
residency
requirement.
furthermore,
if
there
was
such
as
petitioner
in
this
case,
a
person
who
would
move
into
county
or
from
out
of
state,
there?s
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
there?s
another
section
of
the
law
that
they?ve
be
attacking
namely
187
subdivision
six.
and
to
that
extent,
it
seems
to
me
that
interest
of
that
class
and
my
adversary
has
pointed
out
to
the
various
classes
possibly
involved
although
we
don?t
have
one
class
in
this
case.
as
to
that
class,
the
interest
of
the
class,
the
petitioners
represent
are
antagonistic,
it?s
a
different
case
and
it
seems
that
the
statute
clearly
is
not
a
durational
residency
requirement,
does
not
by
its
very
terms
requires
someone
be
a
resident
of
the
state
for
a
certain
period
of
time
before
he
can
enroll
in
a
party
and
i
think
that
it?s
a
essentially
not
in
the
case.
in
summary,
i
think
it
can
fairly
be
stated
that
section
186
is
a
reasonable
statute
for
filling
a
compelling
state
interest
by
the
least
drastic
effective
means.
it
is
submitted
that
it
has
a
minimal
effect
on
first
amendment
rights
and
it
is
not
a
durational
residency
requirement
or
there?s
another
argument,
a
grandfather
clause,
there?s
no
racial
motivation
in
this
case.
if
not
a
grandfather
clause,
it?s
the
young
voters
indeed
we
do
have
an
exception
for
young
voters
who
come
of
age.
it
was
not
in
the
complaint
that
any
allegations
of
racial
discrimination
and
i
think
the
decision
in
a
welfare
case,
jefferson
against
hackney,
a
very
recent
decision
of
this
court
clearly
demonstraids
that
the
possible
greater
effect
on
a
racial
minority
or
an
age
minority
is
no
proof
of
the
fact
that
its
racially
discriminatory
law.
and
furthermore,
there?s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
and
at
this
point,
i
will
rest.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
was
this
question
here
before?
i
have
made
an
argument
that
there
were
appeals
from
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
which
did
involve
section
186
and
differing
of
enrollment
that
were
appealed
to
this
court,
i
think
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
contended
that
it
did
raise
the
question.
there
was
also
the
case
of
the
georgia
voter
who
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
friedman,
one
of
the
co-counsel
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
fact,
friedman
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
issue
was
that
mr.
friedman
could
not
be
a
candidate
for
congress
because
his
enrollment
was
differed
due
to
a
late
transfer
of
enrollment
and
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
believe
it
did
and
this
court
dismiss
for
lack
of
substantial
federal
question.
