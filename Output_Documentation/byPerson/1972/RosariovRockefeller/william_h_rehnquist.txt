can
your
narrower
argument
would
be
that
the
state?s
interest
against
raiding,
if
it
be
a
legitimate
interest,
can
be
adequately
protected
by
dealing
only
with
those
who
have
been
already
registered?
justice
william

might
not
that
pose
some
kind
of
serious
administrative
problems
though
to
the
registration
officials
that
one
party
could
be
in
and
one
party
be
out
as
long
as
you
do
have
a
state
registration
system?
justice
william

of

you
do
have
a

unique
situation
in

your
four
recognized

don?t
you?
justice

h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenwald,
i
was
a
little
bit
confused
by
one
of
your
earlier
references
to
raidiing.
i
have
understood
that
it
is
being
the
process
by
which
people
unsympathetic
to
the
basic
goals
of
a
party,
try
to
take
it
over
for
a
particular
period
of
time.
perhaps
erroneous,
i
got
the
impression
from
one
of
your
comments
that
you
thought
of
raidiing
as
something
broader
as
a
party
on
its
own
initiative
going
out
and
getting
independence
to
join
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
one
of
the
state?s
contentions
here
is
the
given
the
nature
of
the
evil,
it
was
entitled
to
adopt
a
prophylactic
solution
that
struck
generally
at
what
was
involved
and
the
fact
that
it
might
on
occasion
be
a
somewhat
more
attenuated,
nexus
than
others
wouldn?t
necessarily
make
it
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
neuborne,
barred
as
a
candidate
by
virtue
of
a
provision
dealing
with
candidates
or

barred
as
a
candidate
by
virtue
of
this
provision
dealing
with
registration
as
a
voter.

been
this
provision
then?
