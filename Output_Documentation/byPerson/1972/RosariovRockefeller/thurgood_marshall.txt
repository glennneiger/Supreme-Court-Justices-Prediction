mr.
greenwald,
basically
raidiing
is
done
by
one
party
going
into
the
other
party
temporarily,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that?s
not
true
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
this
record
that
shows
that
this
people
wherever
in
any
other
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
they
be
changing
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
change
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
political
status?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
to
show
that
they
were
independent,
maybe
they
weren?t
just
voting
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
people
who
don?t
vote
aren?t
independents.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you?re
dealing
with
peoples
rights
here
and
i
think
you
have
to
show
some
basis
in
order
to
deny
them
that
right.
and
your
basis
is
that
this
law
is
to
protect
people
from
raidiing
another
party
which
is
not
this
case
i
submit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
also
a
crossover
voting
in
new
zealand
i
imagine
too
but
these,
we
are
restricted
to
these
plaintiffs
and
declare
state
they
represent,
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
anybody
in
this
place
was
crossing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
those
the
constitution
speaks
as
to
the
person
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
two
voters
in
new
york
who
switched
parties
and
that
has
what
effect
on
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
about,
did
you
say
those
that
require
citizenship
in
the
meantime

be
registered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
could---
justice
thurgood
marshall
while
in
the
seventh
district,
there
is
sometime
three
and
400,
one
place,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
to
take
all
those
off
and
register
them
in
one
party,
would
that
be
raidiing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
wouldn?t
that
be
raidiing
as
i---
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there?s
nothing
you
can
do
about
that,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
it
was
raidiing,
is
there
anything
new
york
could
do
to
stop
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?s
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
be
dis-enrolled
for
going
in
a
block
to
register?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
in
your
statutes
defines
what?s
raidiing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
couldn?t
do
anything
for
instance.
