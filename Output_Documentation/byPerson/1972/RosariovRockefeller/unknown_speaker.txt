unknown
speaker
what
category
are
these
named
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
and
they
never
had
been
enrolled?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see,
i
thought
this
was
a
group
who
after
the
ratification
of
the
amendment
committing
18
to
21
year
olds
to
vote,
the
first
time
became
eligible
and
that
was
after
the
general
election,
is
not
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
aren?t
they
a
group
who
became
18
to
21
and
eligible
to
vote
following
the
ratification
of
the
amendment?
unknown
speaker
1971.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
become
18
after
the
general
election,
they
could.
unknown
speaker
but
this
group
could
not?
unknown
speaker
they
could
have,
you
say
that
this
named
plaintiffs
were
eligible
to
enroll
prior
to
the
general
election?
unknown
speaker
well
what
implications
under
new
york
primary?
unknown
speaker
and
where,
june
28,
and
at
that
primary
were
nominations
for
other
offices
in
the
federal
offices?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn?t
their
other
problem
of
a
crossover,
say
by
democrats
into
republican
primary
to
influence
the
choice
of
the
republican
nominee
and
then
vote
against
them
at
the
general
election.
unknown
speaker
it
can
work
both
ways
alright.
unknown
speaker
help
me
in
that
primary
in
june
were
to
be
any
sort
of
vote
which
had
a
bearing
on
the
selection
of
delegates
to
the
national
convention?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
fact
what
what?s
at
stake
in
this
particular
vote?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
wasn?t
this
a
bunch
of
youngsters
who
were
sort
if
they
could
vote
in
the
primary
would
probably
vote
for
the
democratic
candidates
something?
unknown
speaker
they?re
academic
now.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
it
based
on
the
fact
that
new
york
is
the
only
state
that
has
the
period,
the
first
period
from
the
date
before
the
previous
general
election?
unknown
speaker
has
(inaudible)
almost?
unknown
speaker
after
the
general
election,
could
anyone
of
these
have
enrolled?
unknown
speaker
after
the
71
general
election?
unknown
speaker
who
may?
unknown
speaker
who
may?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
that
in
there?
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
one
go
about
if
he
falls
anyone
of
those
classes,
what?s
he
do?
unknown
speaker
so
in
the
sense
that
starts
it
may
sometime?
unknown
speaker
and
led
a
higher
statute
and
barred
them
from
being
a
candidate
if
he
had
voted
on
a
primary
of
the
upset
party
anytime
within
the
previous
four
years
maybe?
unknown
speaker
was
this
question
here
before?
unknown
speaker
did
it
raise
the
same
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don?t
want
that
one,
i
want
friedman.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
issue
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
so
it
raises
the
same
issue,
the
constitutionality
of
this
section?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact
that
it
did
fill
with
the
application
of
186
treated
them
as
not
properly
enrolled,
didn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well
how
do
they
differ?
unknown
speaker
one
of
substantial
federal
question,
that?s
a
different
thing
to
dismissing
of
course
the
state
decision
to
the
rest
of
the
inadequate
state
candidates?
unknown
speaker
so
we
can?t
treat
it
as
having
been
handled
here
on
the
ground
of
the
rest
of
inadequate
state
candidate?
unknown
speaker
can
we
enlighten,
we
certainly
didn?t
when
we
dismissed
the
toronto?s
substantial
questions?
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
if
you
couldn?t
bar
a
voter,
for
sure
you
shouldn?t
be
able
to
bar
a
candidate?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
don?t
think
you
would
be.
unknown
speaker
they
only
raid
when
it?s
hot?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
fact
is
anyway
and
they
organized
effort
to
organize
the
new
18
to
21
new
voters
didn?t
get
underway
well
way
after
the
general
election
in
1971?
unknown
speaker
i
entirely
remember
it,
you
didn?t
come
here,
i
forgot
whether
it
was
you
on
the
stay
until
just
few
days
before
the
primary
even.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
did
that,
it
usually
the
way
with
this
election
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
category
are
these
named
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
and
they
never
had
been

unknown
