mr.
richard
e.
hicks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
question
we
have
here
is
a
very
narrow
one,
relative
to
the
pearce
due
process
question.
i
believe
this
court
has
held
in
stroud,
the
pearce,
and
the
colten
cases
that
nether
double
jeopardy
or
equal
protection
impose
an
absolute
bar
to
a
higher
sentence.
so
i
think,
we
are
limited
in
this
case
to
the
narrow
question
of
whether
or
not
a
jury
can
impose
a
harsher
sentence
on
retrial
and
the
authority
involved
here
is
the
pearce
case.
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
read
the
case
and
as
i
read
the
case.
and
hopefully
as
the
court
wrote
the
case
that
was
based
on
the
due
process
argument
or
requirement
that
a
prisoner
should
be
free
from
apprehension
that
should
he
appeal
he
might
receive
a
higher
sentence
solely
because
he
appealed.
the
judge
is
saying,
you
appealed
my
ruling,
my
sentence,
well,
i’m
going
to
show
you.
now,
we
just
don’t
have
that
with
juries.
there’s
not
the
same
motivation
there.
there
is
just
no
vindictiveness.
a
judge
has
his
career
to
look
after,
perhaps
as
in
georgia,
he
runs
for
election.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
we
don’t
ask
for
it,
it's
on
the
statute
books.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
mean
he
does
know
--
it's
not
up
to
us
to
decide.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
he
can
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
sometimes
he
doesn’t.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
what
i
have
said
in
myself
many
times
when
the
death
penalty
was
in
exist
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
would
say,
“well,
we’ve
waive
the
death
penalty
but
we
are
not
to
waive
anything
else.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
they
never
given
it
when
i
was
trying
the
case.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
whether
you
ask
for
it
or
not?
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
just
doesn’t
charge
on
death.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
in
my
experience,
right.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
been
my
experience.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
it
would
appear
from
that.
i
will
ask
the
question
that
was
asked
of
mr.
zell.
this
--
the
arguments
are
not
transcribed.
they
may
have
been
recorded,
but
they
are
not
transcribing
the
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
the
instruction,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
don’t
know.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
and
not
necessarily.
perhaps
they
just
didn’t
waive
it.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
they
will
normally
charge
him
anyway.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
for
robbery
he
was
charged
with
death,
life
or
up
one
to
twenty.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
he
charged
death,
he
also
charged
life
and
he
charged
120
on
both
trials.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
i
think
the
problem
with
that
is
then
the
jury
says
well,
that’s
the
top.
maybe,
we
don’t
want
to
give
him
the
maximum
as
they
said
in
this
case,
they
said
we
want
to
give
them
life,
we
don't
want
to
give
him
death,
but
they
say
that
the
15
would
be
the
top
limit
so
they
probably
come
down
a
little
bit.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well
if
there’s
vindictiveness,
that’s
way
i
read
pearce.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
he
could
say
that
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no,
he
can’t
do
it
on
the
life
or
death
charge
but
he
could
on
a
less
sentence.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
that
was
cited
in
our
brief
of
the
code
section.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no
sir.
i
have
copied
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
they
were
not
transcribed.
i
know
that,
whether
not
they
were
taken
down,
i
don’t
know
but
i
could
find
it
out.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes,
that’d
be
good.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no,
not
that
case
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
i
do
know
of
the
record
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
he
didn’t
waive
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
if
i
know
he
instructed
it
because
i
have
the
instructions.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
i
don’t
know
from
the
record
because
we
don’t
have
the
record.
now
personally,
the
prosecutor’s
office
is
right
next
door
to
me
and
he
has
told
me
that
he
asked
for
it
and
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
both,
the
facts
in
the
case,
it’s
a
horrible
case,
and
he
asked
for
it
in
both
cases
because
of
a
horribleness
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
when
he
says
i
assume
that’s
true.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
don’t
remember
reading
it
myself,
so
i
can't
say--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
okay.
i
like
to
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
the
appellant
here
seems
to
be
very
concerned
with
the
chilling
effect
of
the
possibility
of
a
higher
sentence
on
the
appeal
but
i
think
he
is
over
estimating
this
chilling
effect.
as
it
stands
now,
every
appellant,
everybody
who
is
convicted
who
comes
along
appeals
this
case
i
think
that’s
a
matter
of
general
knowledge.
now,
it
certainly
hasn’t
been
too
chilling
in
my
experience
so
far
and
look
at
the
possibilities
should
he
appeal.
the
fact
is
that
if
he
appeals,
he
has
a
four
possibilities.
he
can
come
out
less,
he
can
come
out
and
be
turned
loose
the
second
time
not
guilty,
he
can
come
out
with
less
time
the
second
time
around,
he
can
come
out
with
the
same
amount
or
he
can
get
more
but
the
first
two
possibilities,
that
is
that
he
will
be
found
not
guilty
or
he
will
get
less
times
seem
to
be
the
more
reasonable
predictions
of
what
will
happen
because
the
second
time
around,
the
prosecution,
i
can
tell
you
has
a
hard
time
getting
the
witness
as
the
first
time.
and
the
second
time,
it’s
even
harder
to
round
up
the
witnesses.
they
die,
they
move,
they
forget
what
they
said
the
first
time.
the
information
is
not
clear
on
their
minds
anymore
and
in
fact
the
possibilities
are
getting
more
time
or
very
negligible.
this
is
the
only
case
i’ve
seen
is
come
on,
of
course,
as
i
have
researched,
i’ve
seen
there
have
been
a
few
through
the
courts
but
it's
really
not
that
big
scare.
they
all
want
to
appeal.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
majority
of
them
want
to
appeal
anyway,
no
matter
what
their
sentence
is.
now,
mr.
zell
in
his
brief
in
his
argument,
it
seems
to
say
that
we
are
limited
at
first
sentence.
that
first
sentence
is
the
best,
i
guess,
but
really,
we
don’t
claim
that
this
first
sentence
is
anything
particularly
significant
are
wholly
about
the
first
sentence.
perhaps,
the
jury
and
jury
sentencing
didn’t
have
all
the
information
that
the
second
jury
had
and
what
we
are
looking
after
really
is
justice.
now,
what’s
right
in
a
particular
case,
a
particular
sentence
and
a
particular
case?
we’ll
bring
about
rehabilitation
of
this
person
if
he
is
really
rehabilitatable
or
what
punishment
is
due
if
punishment
is
due?
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no,
i
don’t.
the
first
time
around,
the
defendant
had
a
purely
an
alibi
defense.
he
said
he
was
in
warm
springs
at
the
time
this
crime
was
committed
and
he
presented
an
alibi
witness,
who
said
he
was
in
warm
springs.
that
was
his
defense.
the
second
time
around
and
now
of
course
the
state's
case
was
the
same,
we
had
the
same
victim,
same
outcry
of
witnesses
and
things
of
that
nature.
but
the
defendant,
the
second
time
around
said,
he
didn’t
present
his
alibi
witness,
he
just
said,
i
was
in
warm
springs
and
i
didn’t
do
it.
then,
he
also
presented
a
psychiatrist
and
a
psychologist
who
said
that
he
did
know
there’s
between
right
and
wrong
under
the
m'naghten
rule
and
he
wasn’t
guilty
for
that
reason.
on
rebuttal,
the
prosecutor
put
up
a
doctor
who
examined
the
defendant
within
four
to
five
hours
prior
to
the
commission
of
this
crime
and
said
he
was
perfectly
fine.
the
defense
psychiatrist
and
psychologist
didn’t
examine
him
until
nine
months
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
before
the
trial.
so,
it
would
seem
to
a
reasonable
person
sitting
on
jury,
a
doctor
who
examined
the
man
within
hours
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
would
seem
to
have
more
credibility
than
a
doctor
who
had
examined
him
some
nine
months
later.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
it
is
remarkable.
it's
almost
unbelievable
the
way
it
happened.
the
victim
in
the
case
lived
in
an
apartment
downstairs
from
the
apartment
where
the
defendant
lived
and
they
were
neighbors.
the
husband
of
the
victim
took
the
defendant
to
the
doctor
on
the
day
this
crime
was
committed.
when
he
came
home
from
the
doctor,
he
dropped
by
to
see
the
victim
and
thank
for
her
for
her
husband
taking
him
to
the
doctor.
and
for
some
reason,
he
then
proceeded
to
strike
her
in
the
head,
knock
her
down,
take
a
t-shirt
and
choke
her.
next
thing
she
remembers
is
waking
up
in
the
woods
in
clayton
county
some
distance
away
where
she
had
been
brutally
beaten.
some
object
had
been
used
on
her
to
sexually
molest
her
and
she
was
terribly
molested
and
beaten,
and
spent
some
considerable
time
in
the
hospital.
now
that
doctor,
we
managed
to
find
out
who
that
doctor
was
that
the
victim’s
husband
took
the
defendant
to
on
the
day
of
the
trial
--
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
and
i
--
as
i
understand,
mr.
zell
was
surprised
when
that
doctor
showed
up
on
rebuttal
testimony.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
so,
for
that
reason,
even
if
we
are
talking
about
the
pearce
pure
vindictiveness
rule
under
the
judge
theory
then,
we
think
there’s
reasonable
grounds
to
see
that
there
were
some
different
evidence
before
this
jury
to
give
more
time
than
the
first
time
around.
and
primarily,
we
say
that
the
pearce
rule
of
looking
for
identifiable
characteristics
after
the
first
trial,
doesn’t
apply
here
because
the
jury
just
doesn’t
apply
vindictiveness.
they
don’t
have
the
same
motivation.
a
judge
is
trying
to
look
out
for
himself.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
if
they
knew
it,
it
would
perhaps
make
a
difference.
but
they
just
don’t
know.
well,
they
would
know
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
it
was
used
here
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes
and
they
knew
there
was
previous
trial,
but
not
of
the
previous
conviction
or
what
the
previous
sentence
was.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
wouldn’t
agree
with
that.
you
have
many
mistrials
in
georgia.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
many
more
mistrials
and
reversals
and
retrials,
i'll
say
that.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
perhaps
they
would
be,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
don’t
think
you
could,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
it
would
--
that
certainly
would
not
be
admissible
in
georgia,
to
say
what
his
prior
sentence
was
and
they
just
wouldn't
know
that
unless
it
was
highly
publicized
crime
or
something
then
they
might
know.
in
a
situation
where
they
would
know
in
a
highly
publicized
crime
or
if
it
should
come
out
in
the
trial
then
the
pearce
rule
to
show
vindictiveness
could
be
applied
to
the
jury,
but
in
the
general
run
of
the
mill
cases
where
the
jury
does
the
sentencing
the
pearce
vindictiveness
rule
does
just
not
apply
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
also.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
question
we
have
here
is
a
very
narrow
one,
relative
to
the
pearce
due
process
question.
i
believe
this
court
has
held
in
stroud,
the
pearce,
and
the
colten
cases
that
nether
double
jeopardy
or
equal
protection
impose
an
absolute
bar
to
a
higher
sentence.
so
i
think,
we
are
limited
in
this
case
to
the
narrow
question
of
whether
or
not
a
jury
can
impose
a
harsher
sentence
on
retrial
and
the
authority
involved
here
is
the
pearce
case.
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
read
the
case
and
as
i
read
the
case.
and
hopefully
as
the
court
wrote
the
case
that
was
based
on
the
due
process
argument
or
requirement
that
a
prisoner
should
be
free
from
apprehension
that
should
he
appeal
he
might
receive
a
higher
sentence
solely
because
he
appealed.
the
judge
is
saying,
you
appealed
my
ruling,
my
sentence,
well,
i’m
going
to
show
you.
now,
we
just
don’t
have
that
with
juries.
there’s
not
the
same
motivation
there.
there
is
just
no
vindictiveness.
a
judge
has
his
career
to
look
after,
perhaps
as
in
georgia,
he
runs
for
election.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
we
don’t
ask
for
it,
it's
on
the
statute
books.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
mean
he
does
know
--
it's
not
up
to
us
to
decide.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
he
can
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
sometimes
he
doesn’t.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
what
i
have
said
in
myself
many
times
when
the
death
penalty
was
in
exist
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
would
say,
“well,
we’ve
waive
the
death
penalty
but
we
are
not
to
waive
anything
else.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
they
never
given
it
when
i
was
trying
the
case.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
whether
you
ask
for
it
or
not?
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
just
doesn’t
charge
on
death.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
in
my
experience,
right.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
been
my
experience.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
it
would
appear
from
that.
i
will
ask
the
question
that
was
asked
of
mr.
zell.
this
--
the
arguments
are
not
transcribed.
they
may
have
been
recorded,
but
they
are
not
transcribing
the
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
the
instruction,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
don’t
know.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
and
not
necessarily.
perhaps
they
just
didn’t
waive
it.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
they
will
normally
charge
him
anyway.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
for
robbery
he
was
charged
with
death,
life
or
up
one
to
twenty.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
he
charged
death,
he
also
charged
life
and
he
charged
120
on
both
trials.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
i
think
the
problem
with
that
is
then
the
jury
says
well,
that’s
the
top.
maybe,
we
don’t
want
to
give
him
the
maximum
as
they
said
in
this
case,
they
said
we
want
to
give
them
life,
we
don't
want
to
give
him
death,
but
they
say
that
the
15
would
be
the
top
limit
so
they
probably
come
down
a
little
bit.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well
if
there’s
vindictiveness,
that’s
way
i
read
pearce.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
he
could
say
that
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no,
he
can’t
do
it
on
the
life
or
death
charge
but
he
could
on
a
less
sentence.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
that
was
cited
in
our
brief
of
the
code
section.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no
sir.
i
have
copied
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
they
were
not
transcribed.
i
know
that,
whether
not
they
were
taken
down,
i
don’t
know
but
i
could
find
it
out.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes,
that’d
be
good.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no,
not
that
case
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
i
do
know
of
the
record
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
he
didn’t
waive
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
if
i
know
he
instructed
it
because
i
have
the
instructions.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
i
don’t
know
from
the
record
because
we
don’t
have
the
record.
now
personally,
the
prosecutor’s
office
is
right
next
door
to
me
and
he
has
told
me
that
he
asked
for
it
and
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
both,
the
facts
in
the
case,
it’s
a
horrible
case,
and
he
asked
for
it
in
both
cases
because
of
a
horribleness
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
when
he
says
i
assume
that’s
true.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
don’t
remember
reading
it
myself,
so
i
can't
say--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
okay.
i
like
to
--
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
the
appellant
here
seems
to
be
very
concerned
with
the
chilling
effect
of
the
possibility
of
a
higher
sentence
on
the
appeal
but
i
think
he
is
over
estimating
this
chilling
effect.
as
it
stands
now,
every
appellant,
everybody
who
is
convicted
who
comes
along
appeals
this
case
i
think
that’s
a
matter
of
general
knowledge.
now,
it
certainly
hasn’t
been
too
chilling
in
my
experience
so
far
and
look
at
the
possibilities
should
he
appeal.
the
fact
is
that
if
he
appeals,
he
has
a
four
possibilities.
he
can
come
out
less,
he
can
come
out
and
be
turned
loose
the
second
time
not
guilty,
he
can
come
out
with
less
time
the
second
time
around,
he
can
come
out
with
the
same
amount
or
he
can
get
more
but
the
first
two
possibilities,
that
is
that
he
will
be
found
not
guilty
or
he
will
get
less
times
seem
to
be
the
more
reasonable
predictions
of
what
will
happen
because
the
second
time
around,
the
prosecution,
i
can
tell
you
has
a
hard
time
getting
the
witness
as
the
first
time.
and
the
second
time,
it’s
even
harder
to
round
up
the
witnesses.
they
die,
they
move,
they
forget
what
they
said
the
first
time.
the
information
is
not
clear
on
their
minds
anymore
and
in
fact
the
possibilities
are
getting
more
time
or
very
negligible.
this
is
the
only
case
i’ve
seen
is
come
on,
of
course,
as
i
have
researched,
i’ve
seen
there
have
been
a
few
through
the
courts
but
it's
really
not
that
big
scare.
they
all
want
to
appeal.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
majority
of
them
want
to
appeal
anyway,
no
matter
what
their
sentence
is.
now,
mr.
zell
in
his
brief
in
his
argument,
it
seems
to
say
that
we
are
limited
at
first
sentence.
that
first
sentence
is
the
best,
i
guess,
but
really,
we
don’t
claim
that
this
first
sentence
is
anything
particularly
significant
are
wholly
about
the
first
sentence.
perhaps,
the
jury
and
jury
sentencing
didn’t
have
all
the
information
that
the
second
jury
had
and
what
we
are
looking
after
really
is
justice.
now,
what’s
right
in
a
particular
case,
a
particular
sentence
and
a
particular
case?
we’ll
bring
about
rehabilitation
of
this
person
if
he
is
really
rehabilitatable
or
what
punishment
is
due
if
punishment
is
due?
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
no,
i
don’t.
the
first
time
around,
the
defendant
had
a
purely
an
alibi
defense.
he
said
he
was
in
warm
springs
at
the
time
this
crime
was
committed
and
he
presented
an
alibi
witness,
who
said
he
was
in
warm
springs.
that
was
his
defense.
the
second
time
around
and
now
of
course
the
state's
case
was
the
same,
we
had
the
same
victim,
same
outcry
of
witnesses
and
things
of
that
nature.
but
the
defendant,
the
second
time
around
said,
he
didn’t
present
his
alibi
witness,
he
just
said,
i
was
in
warm
springs
and
i
didn’t
do
it.
then,
he
also
presented
a
psychiatrist
and
a
psychologist
who
said
that
he
did
know
there’s
between
right
and
wrong
under
the
m'naghten
rule
and
he
wasn’t
guilty
for
that
reason.
on
rebuttal,
the
prosecutor
put
up
a
doctor
who
examined
the
defendant
within
four
to
five
hours
prior
to
the
commission
of
this
crime
and
said
he
was
perfectly
fine.
the
defense
psychiatrist
and
psychologist
didn’t
examine
him
until
nine
months
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
before
the
trial.
so,
it
would
seem
to
a
reasonable
person
sitting
on
jury,
a
doctor
who
examined
the
man
within
hours
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
would
seem
to
have
more
credibility
than
a
doctor
who
had
examined
him
some
nine
months
later.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
it
is
remarkable.
it's
almost
unbelievable
the
way
it
happened.
the
victim
in
the
case
lived
in
an
apartment
downstairs
from
the
apartment
where
the
defendant
lived
and
they
were
neighbors.
the
husband
of
the
victim
took
the
defendant
to
the
doctor
on
the
day
this
crime
was
committed.
when
he
came
home
from
the
doctor,
he
dropped
by
to
see
the
victim
and
thank
for
her
for
her
husband
taking
him
to
the
doctor.
and
for
some
reason,
he
then
proceeded
to
strike
her
in
the
head,
knock
her
down,
take
a
t-shirt
and
choke
her.
next
thing
she
remembers
is
waking
up
in
the
woods
in
clayton
county
some
distance
away
where
she
had
been
brutally
beaten.
some
object
had
been
used
on
her
to
sexually
molest
her
and
she
was
terribly
molested
and
beaten,
and
spent
some
considerable
time
in
the
hospital.
now
that
doctor,
we
managed
to
find
out
who
that
doctor
was
that
the
victim’s
husband
took
the
defendant
to
on
the
day
of
the
trial
--
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
and
i
--
as
i
understand,
mr.
zell
was
surprised
when
that
doctor
showed
up
on
rebuttal
testimony.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
so,
for
that
reason,
even
if
we
are
talking
about
the
pearce
pure
vindictiveness
rule
under
the
judge
theory
then,
we
think
there’s
reasonable
grounds
to
see
that
there
were
some
different
evidence
before
this
jury
to
give
more
time
than
the
first
time
around.
and
primarily,
we
say
that
the
pearce
rule
of
looking
for
identifiable
characteristics
after
the
first
trial,
doesn’t
apply
here
because
the
jury
just
doesn’t
apply
vindictiveness.
they
don’t
have
the
same
motivation.
a
judge
is
trying
to
look
out
for
himself.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
well,
if
they
knew
it,
it
would
perhaps
make
a
difference.
but
they
just
don’t
know.
well,
they
would
know
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
it
was
used
here
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
yes
and
they
knew
there
was
previous
trial,
but
not
of
the
previous
conviction
or
what
the
previous
sentence
was.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
wouldn’t
agree
with
that.
you
have
many
mistrials
in
georgia.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
many
more
mistrials
and
reversals
and
retrials,
i'll
say
that.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
perhaps
they
would
be,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
i
don’t
think
you
could,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
hicks
it
would
--
that
certainly
would
not
be
admissible
in
georgia,
to
say
what
his
prior
sentence
was
and
they
just
wouldn't
know
that
unless
it
was
highly
publicized
crime
or
something
then
they
might
know.
in
a
situation
where
they
would
know
in
a
highly
publicized
crime
or
if
it
should
come
out
in
the
trial
then
the
pearce
rule
to
show
vindictiveness
could
be
applied
to
the
jury,
but
in
the
general
run
of
the
mill
cases
where
the
jury
does
the
sentencing
the
pearce
vindictiveness
rule
does
just
not
apply
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
also.
thank
you.
