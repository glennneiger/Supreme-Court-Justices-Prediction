justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
charge
he
gave
that
the
dismiss
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
mean
--
now,
he
charges
the
jury.
if
you
find
him
guilty
then
you
must
then
impose
sentence
and
the
limits
are
such
in
such?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
its
an
argument
for
permitting
the
sentence
to
be
increased
later.
i
mean,
after
all
that
the
system
is
supposed
to
be
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
supposed
to
max
the
penalty
of
the
crime
you
say
and
so
the
questions
should
be,
not
whether
its
higher
or
lower
than
the
first
time,
but
whether
on
its
own
basis
is
alright?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
stated
it,
you
just
stated
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
just
stated
that
the
sentencing
should
be
rational.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
should
be
based
on
facts
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
question
should
consider
the
sentence
at
the
second
trial
on
its
own
two
feet
without
regarding
to
the
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
the
way
jackson
just
set
aside
the
sentence,
not
the
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
jury
know
anything
about
the
first
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
possibility
of
vindictiveness?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
in
georgia
does
it
make
any
difference
how
the
prosecutor
goes
for
it?
can
you
argue
about
that?
can
this
prosecutor
argue
about
this
sentence
in
georgia?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
have
ever
any
effect,
do
you
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judge
knows
about
it,
doesn’t
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
prosecutor,
was
he
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
file,
it
is
the
same.
everybody
knows
that
he
was
trying
the
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
the
final
arguments
recorded
in
georgia?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
have
been
transcribed?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
would
you
ask
to
find
that
out,
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
are
colleague
on
the
other
side
may?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
whether
the
closing
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
remember
whether
he
did
the
first
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
first
trial?
is
there
any
transcripts
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same,
so
in
comparison
you
(inaudible)
to
have
both
trials?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
this
a
--
you
mean
43
of
the
50,
that’s
the
counting
them
after
pearce?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
are
wrong
inside?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can’t,
of
course,
you
can’t
claim
that
--
that
the
evil
you
want
to
cure
was
felt
by
your
plan.
he
got
a
higher
a
sentence,
but
his
right
to
appeal
wasn't
deterred?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
talking
about
safeguarding
the
right
of
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
way
you
put
it.
if
you’re
not
going
to
argue
vindictiveness,
you’re
talking
about
the
rights
of,
you
know
of,
somebody
who
wasn’t
here,
some
later
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
not
to
help
him,
but
to
help
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes
but
the
only
the
reason
you’re
doing
it
is
to
make
sure
that
somebody
else’s
rights
to
appeal
weren't
deterred
because
yours
weren’t.
however,
bad
it
is
to
face
the
risk
of
an
increased
sentence,
your
client
wasn’t
deterred
the
least?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
way
you
put
it,
you’re
going
to
have
to
make
the
argument
that
he
was
punished
for
it
and
you
didn’t
make
that
argument
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
after
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
were
the
odds
in
georgia
that
the
jury
would
or
do
you
know?
about
the
jury
giving
death
if
the
prosecutor
doesn’t
ask
for
it
or
is
that
wholly
out
of
the
hands
of
the
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
what
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
can
but
sometimes
he
doesn’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
he
say,
“no,
i
don’t
think
for
a
moment
that
the
death
is
appropriate
in
this
case?”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
not
asking
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
so
you
do
have
a
choice
and
ask
what
you
say
to
the
jury
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
--
in
your
experience
does
a
jury
ever
give
that
prosecution
that
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
do
not
go
for
it
if
you
don’t
ask
for
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
instructions
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
did
the
judge
instruct
for
the
death
penalty
in
the
first
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
is
alleged
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
he
did
then
the
prosecution
must
have
asked
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
both
trials?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
both
trials?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
were
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don’t
know
what
the
prosecutor
--
what
the
posture
of
the
prosecution
was
in
either
trial
with
regard
to
the
death
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
know
that
at
least
the
prosecution
didn’t
waive
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
second
trial
or
the
judge
wouldn’t
have
instructed
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
didn’t
waive
it
in
the
first
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don’t
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
basis
you
would
say
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
i
suppose
if
the
jury
knew
about
for
previous
conviction
and
sentence
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
one,
i
know
of.
i
think
its
certainly
unusual
for
the
transcript
for
previous
file
to
be
used,
in
the
course
to
examining
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
must
have
known
then
there
was
previous
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
are
the
odds
that
really
--
if
there
was
a
previous
trial
that
was
either
a
conviction
--
the
odds
are
that
there
was
a
conviction
that
was
set
aside
or
it
wouldn’t
be
a
second
trial
because
of
double
jeopardy.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
jury
would
be
confused
as
to
what
is
actually
happening.
you
couldn’t--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
couldn't
have
referred
to
the
jury
(inaudible)
been
convicted
and
move
to
set
aside
his
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
charge
he
gave

justice
byron

that
