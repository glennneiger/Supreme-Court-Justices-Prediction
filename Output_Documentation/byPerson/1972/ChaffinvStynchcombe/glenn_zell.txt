mr.
glenn
zell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
--
this
case
involves
the
re-sentence
of
a
man
to
a
higher
sentence
from
retrial.
in
the
first
trial
mr.
chaffin
was
indicted
and
convicted
of
robbery
by
open
force
and
violence,
received
a
sentence
of
15
years.
i
was
then
appointed
to
appeal
his
case.
i
appealed
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
i
raised
one
issue
that
of
the
--
an
instruction
involving
the
putting
the
burden
of
proving
of
alibi
of
the
defendant.
it
was
affirmed,
thereafter
it
went
to
federal
district
court
and
in
the
lead
case
in
georgia,
the
alibi
instruction
in
georgia
was
struck
down.
now,
mr.
justice
black
might
be
more
familiar
with
the
alibi
instruction
in
iowa
when
he
was
on
the
eight
circuit.
he
struck
down
a
similar
instruction
in
iowa.
the
state
did
not
appeal.
mr.
chaffin
then
was
tried
again
on
the
same
charge.
the
evidence
was
exactly
the
same
and
i
like
to
draw
in
this
point
for
just
a
moment.
at
the
second
trial,
i
was
ordered
to
represent
him
in
his
trial.
i
decided
to
add
the
defense
of
insanity.
i
felt
it
was
--
it
involved
with
this
particular
person.
the
evidence
as
to
the
crime
was
exactly
the
same,
one
eye
witness,
the
victim.
one
other
witness
who
thought
he
couldn’t
identify
mr.
chaffin
but
a
man
who
resembled
him.
the
extra
evidence
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
decision
points
out
and
the
state
points
out
in
their
brief
is
that
a
psychologist
and
a
psychiatrist
were
called
to
the
stand
to
testify
for
and
against
the
defendant.
i
called
a
psychiatrist
who
said
he
thought
he
had
a
mental
disorder.
the
state
called
the
psychiatrist
to
say
he
didn’t.
the
state
also
called
a
few
witnesses
to
testify
as
to
the
man’s
appeared
to
be
a
rational
prior
to
the
crime,
that
was
the
extra
evidence.
no
extra
evidence
related
to
the
crime
at
all.
the
jury
then
came
back
with
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
a
substantial
increase.
now
let
me
say
this
to
the
court.
i
had
submitted
an
instruction
to
the
judge
in
the
second
trial
that
the
jury
should
be
charged
if
they
could
give
mr.
chaffin
no
more
than
15
years
what
he
got
in
the
first
trial.
the
judge
refused
the
instruction.
after
the
jury
returned
a
sentence
of
life,
i
thereafter
objected
strenuously
under
pearce
versus
north
carolina.
the
judge
refused
and
let
the
life
sentence
stand.
i
might
add
that
when
the
jury
sets
the
sentence
in
georgia,
the
judge
does
actually
sign
the
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
now
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
let
me
clear
that
a
little
bit,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial
--
we
now
have
a
bifurcated
trial
in
georgia.
we
have
guilt
and
innocence.
now,
we
have
a
sentencing
or
punishment
to
phase
if
he’s
found
guilty.
at
the
time
of
mr.
chaffin’s
both
trials,
there
was
none
of
this.
they
tried
guilt
and
innocence
and
punishment
at
the
same
time.
so
the
judge
charged
the
jury
on
guilt
and
innocence,
and
also
charged
the
jury
on
sentence.
all
in
the
same
same
set
of
instructions,
you
see.
so,
in
charge
in
a
jury
prior
to
the
instructions,
i
said,
your
honor,
if
the
jury
does
find
him
guilty
would
you
include
in
your
charge
they
can
give
no
more
than
15
years
what
he
got
in
the
first
trial.
judge
refused
the
instruction.
mr.
glenn
zell
he
just
--
the
standard
sentence
of
life
or
death.
mr.
glenn
zell
drop
to
death.
mr.
glenn
zell
in
fact,
he
charged
death.
i’ll
cover
that,
the
jury
was
out
about
two
hours
in
the
death
sentence.
they
came
back
filing
for
life.
now
at
this
point,
of
course,
we
are
familiar
with
stroud
versus
u.
s.
which
this
court
in
1919,
“the
birdman
of
alcatraz”,
i
think
he
was
known
as,
received
a
life
sentence.
he
appealed
it,
reversed
it
and
on
this
retrial,
he
got
death
and
this
court
affirmed
it.
now
of
course,
furman
versus
georgia
come
out,
again
my
state,
and
this
--
that
they
may
or
may
not
still
be
enforced,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
there’s
been
the
greene
case,
but
that
deals
with
now
--
with
conviction
with
the
crime
itself,
we're
talking
about
punishment.
greene
dealt
with
first
degree
and
second
arson.
the
georgia
case,
i
think
it
was
price
versus
georgia
dealt
with
the
man
slaughter
murder
verdicts.
you
remember
that?
where
he
was
found
guilty
of
murder,
you
reversed
it.
you
found
him
guilty
of
man
slaughter,
georgia
tried
to
try
him
again
for
murder,
you
said
they
can't
do
it.
he
was
acquitted
of
murder,
manslaughter
was
most
he
could
get
on
second
retrial.
we’re
talking
here
about
punishment,
not
about
crime
which
clearly
there
is
a
difference.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
justice
harlan,
mr.
justice
marshall,
mr.
justice
douglas
say
that
double
jeopardy
applies
to
punishment
as
well
as
the
crime.
i’ve
taken
this
attack
as
well
and
accepted
it
naturally.
i
also
argued
due
process
and
equal
protection.
i
thereafter,
after
the
conviction
of
life,
i
went
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
they
affirmed
it,
again,
citing
a
previous
georgia
case.
i
then
went
to
the
federal
district
court
in
the
second
go
around
and
judge
sydney
smith
affirmed
it,
denied
the
writ
and
then
i
went
to
the
fifth
circuit.
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
i
lost
in
four
courts
and
i
am
now
before
this
court.
i
didn’t
get
a
a
dissent
yet.
i’d
like
to
then
get
into
the
constitutional
questions
involved
here.
very
surely
of
course,
it’s
the
right
of
appeal
obviously.
if
a
man
gets
a
sentence,
if
he
gets
a
high
sentence,
of
course,
he
has
less
to
loose.
he
will
appeal
if
he
gets
a
life
sentence
certainly
or
certainly
a
death
sentence,
but
if
a
man
gets
one
or
two
years,
now
for
example
rape.
in
georgia
it's
anywhere
from
one
year
to
20
years
life
or
death.
if
a
man
gets
one
or
two
years
on
a
rape
charge
or
a
robbery
charge
which
is
anywhere
from
one
to
20
years
life
or
death
or
burglary
which
is
one
to
20.
forgery
is
one
to
10,
theft
or
taking
is
one
to
10.
so
meaning,
if
it’s
a
low
end
of
sentence,
one
or
two
years.
there’s
this
threat
by
the
state.
it’s
implied
for
it
obviously,
that
if
you
appeal
on
a
retrial,
we’ll
go
for
the
maximum
sentence.
this
is
a
built-in
threat,
it’s
not
an
expressed
threat,
it’s
an
implied
threat,
not
to
appeal.
now,
i
think
in
any
system
of
justice,
we
should
encourage
a
man
to
exercise
his
rights,
whether
it'd
be
for
jury
trial
or
for
an
appeal
and
we
should
encourage
--
mr.
glenn
zell
we
have
--
i
think
we
have
a
more
subtle
vindictiveness,
your
honor.
in
pearce,
it
was
the
--
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
it’s
like
playing
russian
roulette
with
the
man’s
freedom.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
that’s
correct.
i
agree.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
--
no
--
the
way
of
a
different
problem
in
pearce.
pearce,
deals
with
an
obviously
vindictive
judge,
no
question
about
the
judge.
he
was
increasing
sentence
for
no
reason.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct,
but
there
are
words
in
pearce
that
i
could
certainly
use.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
pearce
just
dealt
with
the
vindictive
judge.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
my
argument
is
a
--
i
think
i've
several
points
of
argument,
i'll
discuss
jackson
versus
u.s,
i
think
its
a
very
similar
argument
to
this
case,
the
limburg
kidnapping
crime.
there
if
a
man
pled
guilty,
he
couldn’t
get
death,
but
if
he
had
a
jury
trial,
he
can
get
death
and
this
court
struck
it
down,
justice
marshall
wrote
the
opinion.
this
chills
a
man’s
rights.
so,
jackson
versus
us,
i
could
use
my
argument.
it
fetters
a
man’s
rights.
it
says,
don’t
try
a
jury
trial
or
you
might
get
death,
so
plead
guilty
to
life.
this
court
struck
down
that
provision
of
death
penalty
in
limburg
statute.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
a
possibility,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes
your
honor,
but
i
would
hope
judges
in
their
fairness
and
honesty,
compassion
will
set
a
sentence
that’s
in
line
with
the
crime.
i
think
our
whole
legal
system
is
based
on
fairness
and
justice,
and
i
would
like
to
think
that
a
judge
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
but
you
raise
the
proposition
that
what
is
the
state's
interested
in
increased
penalty
though,
what
is
the
policy,
why
should
the
state
introduce
this
punishment?
mr.
glenn
zell
i
said,
they
have
very
little
if
any
compelling
reason
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
but
of
course
then
you
place
--
the
man
is
going
to
appeal
his
first
conviction,
is
he
not,
and
then
he
won't
appeal
it
because
he
is
afraid
of
an
increase
sentence,
if
he
in
particularly
got
a
low
sentence
the
first
time.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct,
or
in
this
is
to
reduce
the
sentence,
i
am
not
asking
you
to
set
aside
the
conviction.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
there
are
words
in
pearce
that
are
very
helpful
to
this
case
about
the
right
to
extra
due
process,
the
right
to
appeal,
that
you
shouldn’t
be
worried
about
getting
an
increased
sentence.
you
could
certainly
used
that
to
the
subsequent
--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
they
did
not.
now,
let's
take
--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
there
is
none,
obviously
none.
mr.
glenn
zell
because
the
jury
did
not
know
the
first
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
in
the
sentence
increase
at
the
trial,
he
argues
for
a
greater
sentence
to
the
jury.
yes
he
does.
he
argues
for
it.
mr.
glenn
zell
i’m
sure,
it
does
occasionally.
they
hope
it
does,
i
think
the
prosecutor.
but
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
we
have
different
judge
by
the
way
which
makes
no
difference,
the
judges.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
think
the
prosecutor
is
different.
the
judges
--
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
except
the
jury.
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
before.
mr.
glenn
zell
all
at
once.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct
and
bifurcated
to
present
more
evidences
as
to
sentence.
we
have
a
complete
statute
whatever
is
admissible
in
a
sentencing
at
his
trial.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
they
didn’t.
i
didn’t
try
the
first
case.
i
don’t
think
they
did.
i
don’t
think
they
did,
but
they
went
for
it
on
the
second
one.
mr.
glenn
zell
there
was
no
question.
well,
i
argue
as
the
prosecutor
asked
for
the
death
penalty.
under
that
point,
we’d
been
vindicated.
they
did
go
for
the
death
penalty.
let
me
say
this
too
apart
from
vindictiveness,
prior
to
second
trial,
mr.
chaffin
is
in
a
dilemma
as
many
of
these
appellants
would
be,
defendants
would
be.
you
have
been
now
been
convicted
and
reversed
and
let’s
say
you
receive
--
let's
take
a
real
low
sentence
like
one
year.
you’ve
appealed.
there
were
legal
errors
and
you
reversed
it.
now,
what
you
do
at
the
second
trial?
to
protect
yourself
against
an
increased
sentence
by
jury,
you
waive
your
jury
trial
and
try
it
to
the
judge.
the
judge
obviously
knows
the
prior
conviction,
would
have
access
to
it
or
read
it
in
the
event
sheets.
so,
we
consider
this
by
the
way
waiving
his
right
to
jury
trial
in
the
second
trial.
we
consider
that.
he
asked
my
advice
i
remember
prior
to
the
trial
about
we
should
do,
will
i
get
an
increased
sentence
and
i
told
him
i
couldn’t
answer
that
question.
i
didn't
know,
the
law
was
unsettled.
so
with
the
increased
sentences
and
life
to
death,
four
states
do
not
follow
stroud
and
apparently,
three
do.
iowa
in
1926
allowed
a
sentence
to
go
from
life
to
death
on
the
second
trial
when
the
man
was
executed.
the
same
in
louisiana
and
in
massachusetts
and
dicta
has
said
they
will
allow
going
from
a
life
sentence
to
death.
now,
whether
we’re
talking
about
going
from
five
years
to
20
or
going
from
life
to
death,
i
think
this
is
just
offends
due
process.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
i
don’t
know,
i
better
not
say
that.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
there
was
no
record
made
in
this
case
and
let
me
explain
why.
when
i
filed
the
writ,
in
the
second
go
around
in
the
federal
court
for
judge
sydney
smith,
he
just
asked
for
briefs
and
he
did
not
allow
anything
in
the
record.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
on
both
trials.
they
do
exist.
mr.
glenn
zell
they
normally
are.
i
do
not
want
to
state
to
this
court
that
they
were
recorded
in
this
particular
because
i
don’t
remember.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
i
don’t
remember.
the
actual
trials
were
transcribed
to
show
that
the
evidence
was
exactly
the
same.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
could
check
with
the
clerk
of
the
both
superior
court
and
send
the
records
up
if
the
court
wanted
them
or
get
them
send
up?
mr.
glenn
zell
they
were
recorded
in
the
court
both
transfers.
they’re
filed
in
the
clerk's
office
standing
the
trial
court.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
do
not.
i
do
not,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
glenn
zell
possibly,
yes
your
honor.
possibly,
i
can’t
answer
that.
it’s
been
a
long
time
back
and
i
think
it
was
at
he
same
time
in
71.
it’s
been
almost
two
years.
so,
i
don’t
want
to
say
for
sure
whether
it
was
transcribed
or
not.
i
would
say
this
to
the
court,
i’d
be
going
to
file
an
affidavit
because
i
clearly
remember
it
that
mr.
bill
weller
did
try
for
the
try
for
death
penalty.
i
do
remember
jury
being
out
for
about
three
hours
because
--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
i
didn’t
try
the
first
case.
i
clearly
remember
the
second
trial,
the
reason
why
he
wanted
the
death
penalty
because
when
i
went
out
the
cargo
of
the
trial,
the
victim
was
running
up
and
down
the
cargo
laughing.
mr.
glenn
zell
of
the
trial,
but
i
don’t
know
of
the
final
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
i
think
i
get
affidavits
from
the
attorney,
mr.
rene,
tried
the
first
trial
an
affidavit
from
him,
and
the
district
attorney.
bill
weller
tried
both
trials,
the
district
attorney.
and
i
think
with
affidavits
to
verify
or
clear
up
that
--
but
i
do
not,
they
did
go
for
the
death
penalty
in
the
second
trial
knowing
they
only
got
15
years
the
first.
mr.
glenn
zell
the
death
penalty
in
the
second
trial.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
knowing,
just
knowing
that
he
got
15
in
the
first
and
that’s
vindictiveness
to
me,
is
it
not,
knowing
he
got
15?
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor,
very
definitely.
the
question
we
are
faced
here
of
course
is
does
this
chill
your
right
to
appeal?
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
absolutely
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
here’s
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
in
the
federal
system
in
43
of
the
50
states,
mr.
chaffin
can
actually
get
an
increased
sentence.
what’s
good
for
the
goose
should
be
good
gander
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
in
argument
charlesburg
versus
bradley
said,
well
had
you
until
--
that’s
not
true
in
the
federal
system,
if
you
appeal,
you
don’t
get
anymore
the
second
trial.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
no,
only
seven
states,
the
jury
sets
the
sentence.
only
seven
states.
now,
all
seven
are
against
me,
including
georgia,
all
are
increased.
the
fourth
circuit
agrees
with
me,
the
fifth
circuit
of
course
disagrees
and
there
are
three
district
courts
in
tennessee,
federal
would
agree
with
me.
and
of
course
its
four
to
three
in
states
are
going
from
life
to
death
in
my
favor
i
believe.
so,
there
is
involving
the
principle
of
increased
sentence.
of
course,
this
court
has
only
reached
decision
once
in
stroud.
mr.
glenn
zell
the
jury
sets
it.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct
and
they
are
all
against
me.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
it’s
in
my
brief,
footnote,
if
the
court
would
indulge,
it's
on
page
6,
footnote
2.
and
i
also
cite
the
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
tennessee
on
the
same
page.
but
it's
strange,
seven
to
nothing
against
me
on
life
to
death,
it's
four
to
three
in
my
favor.
so
apparently
as
the
sentence
gets
higher,
they
can
draw
the
line
i
guess.
now
this
court,
i
want
to
mention
this
colten
versus
kentucky,
i
was
frankly
surprised
by
that
decision,
honestly,
but
there
you
drew
the
line
in
misdemeanors.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
it
doesn’t,
it
sure
doesn’t.
but
there
you
drew
the
line
on
misdemeanors.
you
said
well
misdemeanors,
it
wasn’t
really
an
appeal,
it
was
just
going
from
a
g
plea
(ph)
to
a
little
court,
what’s
big
deal
about
going
from
$10.00
fine
to
a
year
in
jail.
i’m
not
sure
exactly
but
i
want
to
point
out
justice
brennan’s
concurring
in
yule
versus
u.s.
he
used
words
about
oppressiveness.
this
is
where
they
set
aside
that
government
withdrew
an
indictment,
one
can
indictment
into
three
can
of
indictment
and
you
concurred
to
the
judge
along,
you
said
it's
certainly
oppressive.
in
this
rule,
we
have
used
an
oppressive
threat
by
a
man
to
if
he
appeals,
if
he
appeals,
what
may
happen?
now,
is
this
what
we
wanted
on
our
system
of
justice?
that’s
all
it
is.
can
a
man
correct
legal
errors?
of
course,
you’ll
deny
an
appellate
court
the
right
of
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
i’m
sure
many
appellate
courts
wouldn't
mind
that.
they
are
overloaded,
but
you’re
certainly
on
a
low
sentence
would
deny
a
man
a
right
of
appeal
no
question
about
it
unless
the
court
will
disregard
that
statement.
i
was
going
to
raise
the
death
on
parker
versus
north
carolina
and
i’ll
point
out
where
they
had
a
bad
death
penalty
--
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
if
he
had
to
go
over
again
i’m
sure
he
would
want
to.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i’m
asking
this
court--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
you
can
correct
this
--
mr.
chaffin
--
you
can
reduce
the
sentence
to
15
years
or
i
think
under
georgia
procedures,
if
you
did
they
keep
the
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
we’ll
certainly
to
help
him.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
well,
he
did
appeal.
he
exercised
his
right
and
got
punished
for
it,
that’s
correct.
we’ve
had
about
four
subsequent
georgia
cases
on
the
same
point.
i
might
point
out,
it’s
not
in
my
brief,
i
reversed
the
case
--
mr.
glenn
zell
i
am
making
it
now
--
mr.
glenn
zell
--
and
i
clearly
state
in
my
brief
that
he
was
punished
and
he
did
get
an
increased
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
think
it’s
a
scheme
by
the
state
certainly
to
go
for,
in
this
case
death
penalty
maybe
what
if
they
didn't
get
this
one
for
life.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
didn’t
get
a
chance,
your
honor.
i
filed
a
writ
and
after
briefs
were
filed,
he
didn’t
ask
for
any
transcripts
which
is
that's
why
this
is
not
before
this
court,
he
denied
the
writ.
we're
talking
about
the
second
go
around
now,
an
increase?
mr.
glenn
zell
did
not
have
a
hearing,
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
would
offer
the
two
trial
transcripts
to
show
that
the
trials
were
exactly
the
same
not
as
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
say,
there
were
exactly
the
same
evidence.
no
reason
for
the
increase,
except
the
first
jury
did
and
another
first
--
mr.
glenn
zell
based
and
relied
on
pearce
that
he
was
punished
for
his
right
of
appeal.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
alleged
vindictiveness
by
the
state,
yes.
i
think
i
used
vindictiveness,
it's
in
the
appendix
and
we
have
it
laid
out.
mr.
glenn
zell
that
--
that
is
--
plea
negotiation,
your
honor
is
apparently
been
upheld
by
this
court
i
think
in
alfred
versus
north
carolina,
you
upheld
even
the
man
seems
innocent,
you
have
the
plea.
that’s
always
bothered
me
and
in
the
states
and
i
think
it’s
on
federal
courts
where
--
mr.
glenn
zell
it
certainly
bothers
me
because
the
man
should
exercised
--
mr.
glenn
zell
i
don’t
accept
that
principle
because
it
does
punish
for
you
saying,
i
am
saying
my
rights
to
have
a
jury
trial,
is
that
right?
yes,
you
do.
you
want
me
to
go
trial.
well,
if
you
go
to
trial
and
we
--
you
--
we
find
you
guilty
either
by
judge
or
jury
we’re
going
to
give
you
15.
it
bothers
me
because
why
would
they
offer
five
in
the
very
beginning,
if
he
didn’t
deserve
the
five.
we
are
talking
about
theoretical,
what
--
does
this
man
deserve
for
punishment?
what
he’s
done?
not
because
he
asked
for
a
jury
trial
or
because
he
asked
for
an
appeal.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
the
problem
that
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
it
would
possibly
break
down.
i
don’t
know
if
it
would
but
would
break
down
plea
negotiations.
now,
in
many
counties
in
our
state,
we
do
not
have
any
plea
negotiations
and
it
works.
the
system
works.
other
county
such
as
atlanta
which
is
a
big
city,
fulton
county,
we
have
plea
negotiations.
i
don’t
know
what
the
answer
would
be,
if
we
didn’t
punish
a
man
for
trying
this
case.
i
think
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia,
the
federal
court
i
don’t
like
to
think
and
i
don’t
believe
that
these
federal
judges,
punish
the
man
for
trying
his
case
i
don’t
think
they
do.
they
do
in
state
courts
obviously.
i
accept
that,
i
concede
that.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
page
5,
paragraph
7,
that
the
entire
retrial
was
void
and
illegal
since
the
jury
was
qualified
in
death
sentence
and
several
juries
were
excluded
and
the
state
argued
the
death
penalty
and
the
trial
judge
charged
on
a
law
of
capital
punishment
to
the
jury.
that
indicates
--
mr.
glenn
zell
i
think
it
would
be
a
reasonable--
mr.
glenn
zell
and
i
site
griffin
and
douglas
which
is
of
course
your
case
in
avenues
of
appeal.
once
they
are
open,
they
should
name
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
apparently
he
did
charge
but
they
only
filed
15
years.
apparently,
they
did
go
from
death
sentence
in
both
cases.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes
your
honor.
we
still
alleged
though.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
right.
mr.
glenn
zell
let
me
just
say
this
up
on
my
defense
is
a
fairly
pitch
quite
a
bit
from
doctors
and
so
the
witness.
they
would
have
just
had
seen
him
and
just
said
that
he
appeared
to
be
okay
to
me
which
you
could
think
of
napoleon,
and
some
of
you
might
think
you
are
okay
just
for
a
few
minutes
but
anyway,
the
evidence
was
the
same
as
to
the
crime.
you
say
that’s
the
important
thing
we
are
concerned
with.
this
court
has
never
commented
or
discussed
stroud
problem,
life
to
death.
it
seems
to
stay
away
from
that
and
that's
what
i
am
asking
this
court
to
do
is
overturn
the
doctrine.
and
the
--
what
i
am
saying
is
i
am
agreeing
with
justice
douglas
and
i
believe
justice
marshall
in
their
concurring
in
pearce
case.
the
balancing,
the
sentence
upward
or
downward
on
a
retrial,
you
should
favor
the
defendant
on
balance
to
give
him
the
unfettered
right
of
appeal.
that’s
basically
the
primary
base
of
my
argument
is
justice
douglas
as
concurring
in
pearce.
mr.
glenn
zell
they
charged
him
with
many,
many
other
crimes
in
other
counties.
clayton
county,
he
mentioned
an
adjoining
county
charged
with
some
sexual
act
and
another
crimes.
i
think
they
were
disposed
of--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
this
victim
and
i
think
they
were
disposed
of
either
by
concurring
sentence
of
few
years
or
dismissed.
but
the
only
charge
against
him
was
the
robbery
case.
he
actually
robbed
her
car
that’s
this
case
was
about.
after
not
already
took
her
car
and
that
what’s
the
charge
is
stealing
or
robbing
her
car
by
force
and
violence.
but
i
want
to
stress
this
stroud
doctrine
that
is
still
alive
and
that’s
what
i
want
to
see
overturned
from
life
to
death
that
is
still
with
this
court
it
has
never
been
overturned.
thank
you.
mr.
glenn
zell
thank
you.
mr.
glenn
zell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
--
this
case
involves
the
re-sentence
of
a
man
to
a
higher
sentence
from
retrial.
in
the
first
trial
mr.
chaffin
was
indicted
and
convicted
of
robbery
by
open
force
and
violence,
received
a
sentence
of
15
years.
i
was
then
appointed
to
appeal
his
case.
i
appealed
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
i
raised
one
issue
that
of
the
--
an
instruction
involving
the
putting
the
burden
of
proving
of
alibi
of
the
defendant.
it
was
affirmed,
thereafter
it
went
to
federal
district
court
and
in
the
lead
case
in
georgia,
the
alibi
instruction
in
georgia
was
struck
down.
now,
mr.
justice
black
might
be
more
familiar
with
the
alibi
instruction
in
iowa
when
he
was
on
the
eight
circuit.
he
struck
down
a
similar
instruction
in
iowa.
the
state
did
not
appeal.
mr.
chaffin
then
was
tried
again
on
the
same
charge.
the
evidence
was
exactly
the
same
and
i
like
to
draw
in
this
point
for
just
a
moment.
at
the
second
trial,
i
was
ordered
to
represent
him
in
his
trial.
i
decided
to
add
the
defense
of
insanity.
i
felt
it
was
--
it
involved
with
this
particular
person.
the
evidence
as
to
the
crime
was
exactly
the
same,
one
eye
witness,
the
victim.
one
other
witness
who
thought
he
couldn’t
identify
mr.
chaffin
but
a
man
who
resembled
him.
the
extra
evidence
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
decision
points
out
and
the
state
points
out
in
their
brief
is
that
a
psychologist
and
a
psychiatrist
were
called
to
the
stand
to
testify
for
and
against
the
defendant.
i
called
a
psychiatrist
who
said
he
thought
he
had
a
mental
disorder.
the
state
called
the
psychiatrist
to
say
he
didn’t.
the
state
also
called
a
few
witnesses
to
testify
as
to
the
man’s
appeared
to
be
a
rational
prior
to
the
crime,
that
was
the
extra
evidence.
no
extra
evidence
related
to
the
crime
at
all.
the
jury
then
came
back
with
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
a
substantial
increase.
now
let
me
say
this
to
the
court.
i
had
submitted
an
instruction
to
the
judge
in
the
second
trial
that
the
jury
should
be
charged
if
they
could
give
mr.
chaffin
no
more
than
15
years
what
he
got
in
the
first
trial.
the
judge
refused
the
instruction.
after
the
jury
returned
a
sentence
of
life,
i
thereafter
objected
strenuously
under
pearce
versus
north
carolina.
the
judge
refused
and
let
the
life
sentence
stand.
i
might
add
that
when
the
jury
sets
the
sentence
in
georgia,
the
judge
does
actually
sign
the
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
now
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
let
me
clear
that
a
little
bit,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial
--
we
now
have
a
bifurcated
trial
in
georgia.
we
have
guilt
and
innocence.
now,
we
have
a
sentencing
or
punishment
to
phase
if
he’s
found
guilty.
at
the
time
of
mr.
chaffin’s
both
trials,
there
was
none
of
this.
they
tried
guilt
and
innocence
and
punishment
at
the
same
time.
so
the
judge
charged
the
jury
on
guilt
and
innocence,
and
also
charged
the
jury
on
sentence.
all
in
the
same
same
set
of
instructions,
you
see.
so,
in
charge
in
a
jury
prior
to
the
instructions,
i
said,
your
honor,
if
the
jury
does
find
him
guilty
would
you
include
in
your
charge
they
can
give
no
more
than
15
years
what
he
got
in
the
first
trial.
judge
refused
the
instruction.
mr.
glenn
zell
he
just
--
the
standard
sentence
of
life
or
death.
mr.
glenn
zell
drop
to
death.
mr.
glenn
zell
in
fact,
he
charged
death.
i’ll
cover
that,
the
jury
was
out
about
two
hours
in
the
death
sentence.
they
came
back
filing
for
life.
now
at
this
point,
of
course,
we
are
familiar
with
stroud
versus
u.
s.
which
this
court
in
1919,
“the
birdman
of
alcatraz”,
i
think
he
was
known
as,
received
a
life
sentence.
he
appealed
it,
reversed
it
and
on
this
retrial,
he
got
death
and
this
court
affirmed
it.
now
of
course,
furman
versus
georgia
come
out,
again
my
state,
and
this
--
that
they
may
or
may
not
still
be
enforced,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
there’s
been
the
greene
case,
but
that
deals
with
now
--
with
conviction
with
the
crime
itself,
we're
talking
about
punishment.
greene
dealt
with
first
degree
and
second
arson.
the
georgia
case,
i
think
it
was
price
versus
georgia
dealt
with
the
man
slaughter
murder
verdicts.
you
remember
that?
where
he
was
found
guilty
of
murder,
you
reversed
it.
you
found
him
guilty
of
man
slaughter,
georgia
tried
to
try
him
again
for
murder,
you
said
they
can't
do
it.
he
was
acquitted
of
murder,
manslaughter
was
most
he
could
get
on
second
retrial.
we’re
talking
here
about
punishment,
not
about
crime
which
clearly
there
is
a
difference.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
justice
harlan,
mr.
justice
marshall,
mr.
justice
douglas
say
that
double
jeopardy
applies
to
punishment
as
well
as
the
crime.
i’ve
taken
this
attack
as
well
and
accepted
it
naturally.
i
also
argued
due
process
and
equal
protection.
i
thereafter,
after
the
conviction
of
life,
i
went
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
they
affirmed
it,
again,
citing
a
previous
georgia
case.
i
then
went
to
the
federal
district
court
in
the
second
go
around
and
judge
sydney
smith
affirmed
it,
denied
the
writ
and
then
i
went
to
the
fifth
circuit.
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
i
lost
in
four
courts
and
i
am
now
before
this
court.
i
didn’t
get
a
a
dissent
yet.
i’d
like
to
then
get
into
the
constitutional
questions
involved
here.
very
surely
of
course,
it’s
the
right
of
appeal
obviously.
if
a
man
gets
a
sentence,
if
he
gets
a
high
sentence,
of
course,
he
has
less
to
loose.
he
will
appeal
if
he
gets
a
life
sentence
certainly
or
certainly
a
death
sentence,
but
if
a
man
gets
one
or
two
years,
now
for
example
rape.
in
georgia
it's
anywhere
from
one
year
to
20
years
life
or
death.
if
a
man
gets
one
or
two
years
on
a
rape
charge
or
a
robbery
charge
which
is
anywhere
from
one
to
20
years
life
or
death
or
burglary
which
is
one
to
20.
forgery
is
one
to
10,
theft
or
taking
is
one
to
10.
so
meaning,
if
it’s
a
low
end
of
sentence,
one
or
two
years.
there’s
this
threat
by
the
state.
it’s
implied
for
it
obviously,
that
if
you
appeal
on
a
retrial,
we’ll
go
for
the
maximum
sentence.
this
is
a
built-in
threat,
it’s
not
an
expressed
threat,
it’s
an
implied
threat,
not
to
appeal.
now,
i
think
in
any
system
of
justice,
we
should
encourage
a
man
to
exercise
his
rights,
whether
it'd
be
for
jury
trial
or
for
an
appeal
and
we
should
encourage
--
mr.
glenn
zell
we
have
--
i
think
we
have
a
more
subtle
vindictiveness,
your
honor.
in
pearce,
it
was
the
--
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
it’s
like
playing
russian
roulette
with
the
man’s
freedom.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
that’s
correct.
i
agree.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
--
no
--
the
way
of
a
different
problem
in
pearce.
pearce,
deals
with
an
obviously
vindictive
judge,
no
question
about
the
judge.
he
was
increasing
sentence
for
no
reason.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct,
but
there
are
words
in
pearce
that
i
could
certainly
use.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
pearce
just
dealt
with
the
vindictive
judge.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
my
argument
is
a
--
i
think
i've
several
points
of
argument,
i'll
discuss
jackson
versus
u.s,
i
think
its
a
very
similar
argument
to
this
case,
the
limburg
kidnapping
crime.
there
if
a
man
pled
guilty,
he
couldn’t
get
death,
but
if
he
had
a
jury
trial,
he
can
get
death
and
this
court
struck
it
down,
justice
marshall
wrote
the
opinion.
this
chills
a
man’s
rights.
so,
jackson
versus
us,
i
could
use
my
argument.
it
fetters
a
man’s
rights.
it
says,
don’t
try
a
jury
trial
or
you
might
get
death,
so
plead
guilty
to
life.
this
court
struck
down
that
provision
of
death
penalty
in
limburg
statute.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
a
possibility,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes
your
honor,
but
i
would
hope
judges
in
their
fairness
and
honesty,
compassion
will
set
a
sentence
that’s
in
line
with
the
crime.
i
think
our
whole
legal
system
is
based
on
fairness
and
justice,
and
i
would
like
to
think
that
a
judge
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
but
you
raise
the
proposition
that
what
is
the
state's
interested
in
increased
penalty
though,
what
is
the
policy,
why
should
the
state
introduce
this
punishment?
mr.
glenn
zell
i
said,
they
have
very
little
if
any
compelling
reason
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
but
of
course
then
you
place
--
the
man
is
going
to
appeal
his
first
conviction,
is
he
not,
and
then
he
won't
appeal
it
because
he
is
afraid
of
an
increase
sentence,
if
he
in
particularly
got
a
low
sentence
the
first
time.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct,
or
in
this
is
to
reduce
the
sentence,
i
am
not
asking
you
to
set
aside
the
conviction.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
there
are
words
in
pearce
that
are
very
helpful
to
this
case
about
the
right
to
extra
due
process,
the
right
to
appeal,
that
you
shouldn’t
be
worried
about
getting
an
increased
sentence.
you
could
certainly
used
that
to
the
subsequent
--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
they
did
not.
now,
let's
take
--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
there
is
none,
obviously
none.
mr.
glenn
zell
because
the
jury
did
not
know
the
first
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
in
the
sentence
increase
at
the
trial,
he
argues
for
a
greater
sentence
to
the
jury.
yes
he
does.
he
argues
for
it.
mr.
glenn
zell
i’m
sure,
it
does
occasionally.
they
hope
it
does,
i
think
the
prosecutor.
but
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
we
have
different
judge
by
the
way
which
makes
no
difference,
the
judges.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
think
the
prosecutor
is
different.
the
judges
--
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
except
the
jury.
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
before.
mr.
glenn
zell
all
at
once.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct
and
bifurcated
to
present
more
evidences
as
to
sentence.
we
have
a
complete
statute
whatever
is
admissible
in
a
sentencing
at
his
trial.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
they
didn’t.
i
didn’t
try
the
first
case.
i
don’t
think
they
did.
i
don’t
think
they
did,
but
they
went
for
it
on
the
second
one.
mr.
glenn
zell
there
was
no
question.
well,
i
argue
as
the
prosecutor
asked
for
the
death
penalty.
under
that
point,
we’d
been
vindicated.
they
did
go
for
the
death
penalty.
let
me
say
this
too
apart
from
vindictiveness,
prior
to
second
trial,
mr.
chaffin
is
in
a
dilemma
as
many
of
these
appellants
would
be,
defendants
would
be.
you
have
been
now
been
convicted
and
reversed
and
let’s
say
you
receive
--
let's
take
a
real
low
sentence
like
one
year.
you’ve
appealed.
there
were
legal
errors
and
you
reversed
it.
now,
what
you
do
at
the
second
trial?
to
protect
yourself
against
an
increased
sentence
by
jury,
you
waive
your
jury
trial
and
try
it
to
the
judge.
the
judge
obviously
knows
the
prior
conviction,
would
have
access
to
it
or
read
it
in
the
event
sheets.
so,
we
consider
this
by
the
way
waiving
his
right
to
jury
trial
in
the
second
trial.
we
consider
that.
he
asked
my
advice
i
remember
prior
to
the
trial
about
we
should
do,
will
i
get
an
increased
sentence
and
i
told
him
i
couldn’t
answer
that
question.
i
didn't
know,
the
law
was
unsettled.
so
with
the
increased
sentences
and
life
to
death,
four
states
do
not
follow
stroud
and
apparently,
three
do.
iowa
in
1926
allowed
a
sentence
to
go
from
life
to
death
on
the
second
trial
when
the
man
was
executed.
the
same
in
louisiana
and
in
massachusetts
and
dicta
has
said
they
will
allow
going
from
a
life
sentence
to
death.
now,
whether
we’re
talking
about
going
from
five
years
to
20
or
going
from
life
to
death,
i
think
this
is
just
offends
due
process.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
i
don’t
know,
i
better
not
say
that.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
there
was
no
record
made
in
this
case
and
let
me
explain
why.
when
i
filed
the
writ,
in
the
second
go
around
in
the
federal
court
for
judge
sydney
smith,
he
just
asked
for
briefs
and
he
did
not
allow
anything
in
the
record.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
on
both
trials.
they
do
exist.
mr.
glenn
zell
they
normally
are.
i
do
not
want
to
state
to
this
court
that
they
were
recorded
in
this
particular
because
i
don’t
remember.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
i
don’t
remember.
the
actual
trials
were
transcribed
to
show
that
the
evidence
was
exactly
the
same.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
could
check
with
the
clerk
of
the
both
superior
court
and
send
the
records
up
if
the
court
wanted
them
or
get
them
send
up?
mr.
glenn
zell
they
were
recorded
in
the
court
both
transfers.
they’re
filed
in
the
clerk's
office
standing
the
trial
court.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
do
not.
i
do
not,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
glenn
zell
possibly,
yes
your
honor.
possibly,
i
can’t
answer
that.
it’s
been
a
long
time
back
and
i
think
it
was
at
he
same
time
in
71.
it’s
been
almost
two
years.
so,
i
don’t
want
to
say
for
sure
whether
it
was
transcribed
or
not.
i
would
say
this
to
the
court,
i’d
be
going
to
file
an
affidavit
because
i
clearly
remember
it
that
mr.
bill
weller
did
try
for
the
try
for
death
penalty.
i
do
remember
jury
being
out
for
about
three
hours
because
--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
i
didn’t
try
the
first
case.
i
clearly
remember
the
second
trial,
the
reason
why
he
wanted
the
death
penalty
because
when
i
went
out
the
cargo
of
the
trial,
the
victim
was
running
up
and
down
the
cargo
laughing.
mr.
glenn
zell
of
the
trial,
but
i
don’t
know
of
the
final
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
i
think
i
get
affidavits
from
the
attorney,
mr.
rene,
tried
the
first
trial
an
affidavit
from
him,
and
the
district
attorney.
bill
weller
tried
both
trials,
the
district
attorney.
and
i
think
with
affidavits
to
verify
or
clear
up
that
--
but
i
do
not,
they
did
go
for
the
death
penalty
in
the
second
trial
knowing
they
only
got
15
years
the
first.
mr.
glenn
zell
the
death
penalty
in
the
second
trial.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
knowing,
just
knowing
that
he
got
15
in
the
first
and
that’s
vindictiveness
to
me,
is
it
not,
knowing
he
got
15?
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor,
very
definitely.
the
question
we
are
faced
here
of
course
is
does
this
chill
your
right
to
appeal?
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
absolutely
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
here’s
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
in
the
federal
system
in
43
of
the
50
states,
mr.
chaffin
can
actually
get
an
increased
sentence.
what’s
good
for
the
goose
should
be
good
gander
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
in
argument
charlesburg
versus
bradley
said,
well
had
you
until
--
that’s
not
true
in
the
federal
system,
if
you
appeal,
you
don’t
get
anymore
the
second
trial.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
no,
only
seven
states,
the
jury
sets
the
sentence.
only
seven
states.
now,
all
seven
are
against
me,
including
georgia,
all
are
increased.
the
fourth
circuit
agrees
with
me,
the
fifth
circuit
of
course
disagrees
and
there
are
three
district
courts
in
tennessee,
federal
would
agree
with
me.
and
of
course
its
four
to
three
in
states
are
going
from
life
to
death
in
my
favor
i
believe.
so,
there
is
involving
the
principle
of
increased
sentence.
of
course,
this
court
has
only
reached
decision
once
in
stroud.
mr.
glenn
zell
the
jury
sets
it.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct
and
they
are
all
against
me.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
it’s
in
my
brief,
footnote,
if
the
court
would
indulge,
it's
on
page
6,
footnote
2.
and
i
also
cite
the
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
tennessee
on
the
same
page.
but
it's
strange,
seven
to
nothing
against
me
on
life
to
death,
it's
four
to
three
in
my
favor.
so
apparently
as
the
sentence
gets
higher,
they
can
draw
the
line
i
guess.
now
this
court,
i
want
to
mention
this
colten
versus
kentucky,
i
was
frankly
surprised
by
that
decision,
honestly,
but
there
you
drew
the
line
in
misdemeanors.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
it
doesn’t,
it
sure
doesn’t.
but
there
you
drew
the
line
on
misdemeanors.
you
said
well
misdemeanors,
it
wasn’t
really
an
appeal,
it
was
just
going
from
a
g
plea
(ph)
to
a
little
court,
what’s
big
deal
about
going
from
$10.00
fine
to
a
year
in
jail.
i’m
not
sure
exactly
but
i
want
to
point
out
justice
brennan’s
concurring
in
yule
versus
u.s.
he
used
words
about
oppressiveness.
this
is
where
they
set
aside
that
government
withdrew
an
indictment,
one
can
indictment
into
three
can
of
indictment
and
you
concurred
to
the
judge
along,
you
said
it's
certainly
oppressive.
in
this
rule,
we
have
used
an
oppressive
threat
by
a
man
to
if
he
appeals,
if
he
appeals,
what
may
happen?
now,
is
this
what
we
wanted
on
our
system
of
justice?
that’s
all
it
is.
can
a
man
correct
legal
errors?
of
course,
you’ll
deny
an
appellate
court
the
right
of
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
i’m
sure
many
appellate
courts
wouldn't
mind
that.
they
are
overloaded,
but
you’re
certainly
on
a
low
sentence
would
deny
a
man
a
right
of
appeal
no
question
about
it
unless
the
court
will
disregard
that
statement.
i
was
going
to
raise
the
death
on
parker
versus
north
carolina
and
i’ll
point
out
where
they
had
a
bad
death
penalty
--
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
if
he
had
to
go
over
again
i’m
sure
he
would
want
to.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i’m
asking
this
court--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
you
can
correct
this
--
mr.
chaffin
--
you
can
reduce
the
sentence
to
15
years
or
i
think
under
georgia
procedures,
if
you
did
they
keep
the
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
we’ll
certainly
to
help
him.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
correct.
well,
he
did
appeal.
he
exercised
his
right
and
got
punished
for
it,
that’s
correct.
we’ve
had
about
four
subsequent
georgia
cases
on
the
same
point.
i
might
point
out,
it’s
not
in
my
brief,
i
reversed
the
case
--
mr.
glenn
zell
i
am
making
it
now
--
mr.
glenn
zell
--
and
i
clearly
state
in
my
brief
that
he
was
punished
and
he
did
get
an
increased
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
think
it’s
a
scheme
by
the
state
certainly
to
go
for,
in
this
case
death
penalty
maybe
what
if
they
didn't
get
this
one
for
life.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
didn’t
get
a
chance,
your
honor.
i
filed
a
writ
and
after
briefs
were
filed,
he
didn’t
ask
for
any
transcripts
which
is
that's
why
this
is
not
before
this
court,
he
denied
the
writ.
we're
talking
about
the
second
go
around
now,
an
increase?
mr.
glenn
zell
did
not
have
a
hearing,
that’s
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
would
offer
the
two
trial
transcripts
to
show
that
the
trials
were
exactly
the
same
not
as
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
say,
there
were
exactly
the
same
evidence.
no
reason
for
the
increase,
except
the
first
jury
did
and
another
first
--
mr.
glenn
zell
based
and
relied
on
pearce
that
he
was
punished
for
his
right
of
appeal.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
alleged
vindictiveness
by
the
state,
yes.
i
think
i
used
vindictiveness,
it's
in
the
appendix
and
we
have
it
laid
out.
mr.
glenn
zell
that
--
that
is
--
plea
negotiation,
your
honor
is
apparently
been
upheld
by
this
court
i
think
in
alfred
versus
north
carolina,
you
upheld
even
the
man
seems
innocent,
you
have
the
plea.
that’s
always
bothered
me
and
in
the
states
and
i
think
it’s
on
federal
courts
where
--
mr.
glenn
zell
it
certainly
bothers
me
because
the
man
should
exercised
--
mr.
glenn
zell
i
don’t
accept
that
principle
because
it
does
punish
for
you
saying,
i
am
saying
my
rights
to
have
a
jury
trial,
is
that
right?
yes,
you
do.
you
want
me
to
go
trial.
well,
if
you
go
to
trial
and
we
--
you
--
we
find
you
guilty
either
by
judge
or
jury
we’re
going
to
give
you
15.
it
bothers
me
because
why
would
they
offer
five
in
the
very
beginning,
if
he
didn’t
deserve
the
five.
we
are
talking
about
theoretical,
what
--
does
this
man
deserve
for
punishment?
what
he’s
done?
not
because
he
asked
for
a
jury
trial
or
because
he
asked
for
an
appeal.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
the
problem
that
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
it
would
possibly
break
down.
i
don’t
know
if
it
would
but
would
break
down
plea
negotiations.
now,
in
many
counties
in
our
state,
we
do
not
have
any
plea
negotiations
and
it
works.
the
system
works.
other
county
such
as
atlanta
which
is
a
big
city,
fulton
county,
we
have
plea
negotiations.
i
don’t
know
what
the
answer
would
be,
if
we
didn’t
punish
a
man
for
trying
this
case.
i
think
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia,
the
federal
court
i
don’t
like
to
think
and
i
don’t
believe
that
these
federal
judges,
punish
the
man
for
trying
his
case
i
don’t
think
they
do.
they
do
in
state
courts
obviously.
i
accept
that,
i
concede
that.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
page
5,
paragraph
7,
that
the
entire
retrial
was
void
and
illegal
since
the
jury
was
qualified
in
death
sentence
and
several
juries
were
excluded
and
the
state
argued
the
death
penalty
and
the
trial
judge
charged
on
a
law
of
capital
punishment
to
the
jury.
that
indicates
--
mr.
glenn
zell
i
think
it
would
be
a
reasonable--
mr.
glenn
zell
and
i
site
griffin
and
douglas
which
is
of
course
your
case
in
avenues
of
appeal.
once
they
are
open,
they
should
name
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
apparently
he
did
charge
but
they
only
filed
15
years.
apparently,
they
did
go
from
death
sentence
in
both
cases.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes
your
honor.
we
still
alleged
though.
mr.
glenn
zell
that’s
right.
mr.
glenn
zell
let
me
just
say
this
up
on
my
defense
is
a
fairly
pitch
quite
a
bit
from
doctors
and
so
the
witness.
they
would
have
just
had
seen
him
and
just
said
that
he
appeared
to
be
okay
to
me
which
you
could
think
of
napoleon,
and
some
of
you
might
think
you
are
okay
just
for
a
few
minutes
but
anyway,
the
evidence
was
the
same
as
to
the
crime.
you
say
that’s
the
important
thing
we
are
concerned
with.
this
court
has
never
commented
or
discussed
stroud
problem,
life
to
death.
it
seems
to
stay
away
from
that
and
that's
what
i
am
asking
this
court
to
do
is
overturn
the
doctrine.
and
the
--
what
i
am
saying
is
i
am
agreeing
with
justice
douglas
and
i
believe
justice
marshall
in
their
concurring
in
pearce
case.
the
balancing,
the
sentence
upward
or
downward
on
a
retrial,
you
should
favor
the
defendant
on
balance
to
give
him
the
unfettered
right
of
appeal.
that’s
basically
the
primary
base
of
my
argument
is
justice
douglas
as
concurring
in
pearce.
mr.
glenn
zell
they
charged
him
with
many,
many
other
crimes
in
other
counties.
clayton
county,
he
mentioned
an
adjoining
county
charged
with
some
sexual
act
and
another
crimes.
i
think
they
were
disposed
of--
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
this
victim
and
i
think
they
were
disposed
of
either
by
concurring
sentence
of
few
years
or
dismissed.
but
the
only
charge
against
him
was
the
robbery
case.
he
actually
robbed
her
car
that’s
this
case
was
about.
after
not
already
took
her
car
and
that
what’s
the
charge
is
stealing
or
robbing
her
car
by
force
and
violence.
but
i
want
to
stress
this
stroud
doctrine
that
is
still
alive
and
that’s
what
i
want
to
see
overturned
from
life
to
death
that
is
still
with
this
court
it
has
never
been
overturned.
thank
you.
mr.
glenn
zell
thank
you.
