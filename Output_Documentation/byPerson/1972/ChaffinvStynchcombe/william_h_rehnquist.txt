is
it
possible
that
closing
argument
might
have
been
transcribed,
but
are
rather
taken
down
by
the
reporter,
but
not
transcribed
because
neither
party
designated
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state
frequently
asks
for
more
than
it
thinks
it
can
get
or
perhaps
more,
doesn’t
it,
on
a
penalty
phase?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
prosecuting
attorney
thought
that
the
15-year
sentence
awarded
at
the
end
of
first
trial
was
a
very
just
and
proper
one,
and
he
wanted
to
get
just
that
again.
if
he
has
any
sense,
he’s
not
going
to
ask
the
jury
for
15
years,
he’s
going
to
ask
them
for
something
more
because
you’ll
be
asking
for
something
less
and
the
chance
are
the
jury
will
split
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
punishment
connotes
some
sort
of
intentional
vindictiveness
when
you
used
the
word?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh
okay.
what
evidence
did
you
introduced
in
your
habeas
corpus
proceeding
before
judge
smith
in
atlanta
to
show
this
sort
of
intentional
vindictive
alibi?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
that
you
alleged
in
your
habeas
corpus
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
allege
that
there
were
some
sort
of
intentionally
vindictive
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
state?
justice
william

mr.
zell,
i'm
looking
at
pages
4
and
5
of
the
appendix
which
is
your
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
don’t
claim
to
have
read
every
word
of
it
but
i
would
characterize
it
as
simply
alleging
that
the
sentence
was
increased
and
therefore
pearce
was
violated.
i
don’t
see
any
allegation
of
any
sort
of
vindictiveness
or
intent
on
the
part
of
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
the
extent
of
the
allegation
of
vindictiveness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
prosecution
doesn’t
expressly
waive,
but
doesn’t
expressly
argue,
then
does
the
trial
judge
charge
on
him?
