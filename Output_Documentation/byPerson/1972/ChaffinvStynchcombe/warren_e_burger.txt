chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-6732,
chaffin
against
stynchcombe.
mr.
zell,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
give
that
instruction
that
you
requested
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
as
part
of
the
trial
before
they
had
reached
a
verdict,
it
might
have
been
quite
a
hazardous
business.
it
might
have
later
become
a
subject
of
a
charge
that
this
was
a
suggestion
on
a
part
of
the
judge
that
he
was
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
event,
you
covered
that
by
making
the
motion
again
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
almost
any
case
that
you
can
use
for
some
other
case,
can’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
there
another
aspect
of
russian
roulette
as
you
put
it
that
if
this
argument,
an
approach,
your
approach
should
prevail,
you
put
a
premium
on
every
trial
judge
to
give
the
maximum
sentence
on
every
case
so
that
this
can’t
happen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
more
than
a
possibility,
isn’t
it
a
real
probability
over
which
some
public
defenders
are
somewhat
concerned?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
man
was
tried
before
the
bifurcated
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
trial.
so
that
he
was
tried
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
prosecutor
is
considerably
more
inhibited
in
a
single
trial
than
he
is
in
a
bifurcated
trial
when
they
come
to
the
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
prosecution
go
for
the
death
in
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
think
you
might
argue
that
pearce
on
its
face
would
apply
to
a
situation
like
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
go
for
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
the
essence
of
the
adversary
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
made
the
point
a
moment
ago
that
if
your
client
had
to
do
it
over
again,
he
wouldn’t
do
it
and
you
seem
to
rest
something
on
that
as
something
wrong
in
the
system
of
justice.
but
if
you
have
the
man
who
is
offered
in
plea
negotiations
a
five-year
sentence
and
he
finally
rejects
that
and
goes
to
trial
and
then
gets
a
15
years
sentence,
would
you
say,
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
system
of
justice
then?
or
it
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
is
there
something
wrong
with
that
when
he
has
made
a
conscious
choice
with
advice
of
counsel
or
perhaps
against
the
advice
of
this
counsel
to
reject
a
guilty
plea
and
five-year
sentence
and
then
he
goes
to
trial
and
runs
out
and
gets
15,
something
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sure
bothers
the
defendant
when
he
has
made
that
choice
but
i
am
talking
about
the
principle
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
your
approach
would
stop
all
plea
negotiations
entirely
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
zell.
mr.
hicks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
a
jury
can
agree
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
perhaps
the
other
materials
with
the
clerk?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
the
explanation
for
that
rather
remarkable
coincidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there’ll
be
reasonable
grounds
for
surprise
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
circumstances
--[attempt
to
laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
mistrial
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
they
knew
that
to
--
would
it
be
likely
that
they
knew
the
precise
sentence
that
had
resulted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.

zell.

i
don’t
remember
from
the
record
here
was
