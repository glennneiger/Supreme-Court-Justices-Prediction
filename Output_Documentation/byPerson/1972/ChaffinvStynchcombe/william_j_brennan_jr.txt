the

justice

that

--
justice
william

are
you
going
to
try
to
bring
this

within
the
principle
stated
in

justice
william
j.

i
don’t
find
in

to
the

in
this
case,
was
it
recorded?

you
here,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
mean,
you
haven’t
a

justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
if

what
would
you
offer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
about
in
paragraph

the
second
clause
that
they
increased
his
sentence
without
any
legitimate
reason
penalizing
his
petition
for
appealing
his
first
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
notice
you
also,
in
paragraph
two
allege
that
at
the
first
trial,
the
jury
was
qualified
to
a
death
penalty
with
the
trial
judge
did
charge
on
the

well
tell
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

when
you
say,
we
are
waiving
the

penalty
what’s
the
nature
of
the
instruction
that
the

judge
sentenced
this
--
justice
william

well

if

allegations
in
paragraphs
2

5
--2

it

asked
for
the
death
penalty
since
the
trial
judge
charged
him
in
the
both
trials
on
the
death
penalty?

as
in
this

say
well
no
i'll
cut
that
back
to
30
years
or
15
or
something?
justice

that
is
if

10,

he
can’t
cut
