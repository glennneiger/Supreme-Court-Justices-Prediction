mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
like
the
one
which
is
just
been
argued,
the
government
is
appealing
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
enjoining
enforcement
of
a
provision
of
the
food
stamp
act
on
constitutional
grounds.
provision
in
question
is
another
1971
amendment
to
the
act,
this
one
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
tax
dependent
amendment.
generally
speaking,
the
amendment
provides
the
household
of
the
young
adult
was
claimed
by
his
parents
as
a
tax
dependent
is
not
eligible
to
participate
in
the
food
stamp
program
if
his
parents
themselves
do
not
qualify
for
food
stamp
assistance.
now
i
might
add
at
this
point
that
in
order
to
take
a
child
as
a
dependent
for
tax
purposes,
the
parent
must
provide
over
one
half
of
the
child
support.
the
eight
individual
appellees
here
brought
this
suit
as
a
class
action
alleging
that
they
had
been
excluded
from
participation
in
the
food
stamp
program
solely
by
virtue
of
the
operation
of
the
tax
dependent
amendment.
appellees
raise
no
question
of
statutory
interpretation
in
this
case
and
they
did
not
contest
the
applicability
of
the
statute
to
their
individual
cases.
they
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
solely
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
three-judge
court
held
the
provision
unconstitutional,
without
closely
analyzing
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
court
assumed
that
it
necessarily
acted
to
deny
food
stamps
on
the
valid
of
--
on
the
basis
of
invalid
taxpayer
dependency
claims.
court
considered
this
result
to
be
so
grossly
unfair,
in
the
court’s
terms,
as
to
constitute
both
the
denial
of
due
process
and
of
equal
protection.
court
therefore
enjoined
further
enforcement
in
implementation
of
the
tax
dependent
amendment.
as
we
have
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief,
this
case
presents
a
threshold
question
whether
adjudication
of
appellees’
constitutional
claims
as
appropriated
at
this
time.
it
now
appears
that
each
named
appellee
may
have
been
denied
food
stamps
solely
as
a
consequence
of
errors
in
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
tax
dependent
amendment.
we
have
set
forth
our
analysis
of
the
statutory
issues
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
will
not
discuss
them
at
length
here,
but
stated
very
briefly
five
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
were
denied
food
stamp
assistance
on
the
basis
solely
of
invalid
tax
payer
dependency
claims.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no
there
isn’t
and
it
has
been
the
administrative
interpretation
of
this
act
that
it
does
deny
food
stamps,
if
the
claim
of
an
injunction
is
made
and
there's
no
inquiry
into
it
whether
it
is
valid
or
invalid.
that
has
been
the
administrative
interpretation.
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
briefs,
the
statute
certainly
made
but
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
interpreted
in
that
way.
the
other
three
appellees
in
this
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
the
statute
is
construed
as
denying
food
stamps
on
the
basis
of
an
invalid
claim,
then
there
is
no
way
for
the
applicant
to
establish
that
their
claims
is
in
fact
--
that
that
the
tax
payer
claim
was
in
fact
invalid
and
if
they
should
receive
food
stamps,
that
is
correct.
the
statutory
language
talks
merely
in
terms
of
“is
claimed”
and
whether
that
imports
a
requirement
of
validity
is
an
open
question
i
would
think
at
this
time
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
it
concerns
me
in
the
sense
that
we
have
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
this
court
has
frequently
interpreted
statutes
so
as
to
avoid
constitutional
questions.
if
it
were
the
opinion
of
court
that
the
statute
would
be
invalid
as
so
construed
as
denying
food
stamps
on
the
basis
of
invalid
claims
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
interpret
it
as
not
denying
food
stamps
in
such
a
case.
and
i
think
that
such
an
interpretation
would
generally
accord
with
the
statutory
language,
and
would
not
do
a
violence.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
argued
that
even
if
it
is
construed
as
denying
food
stamps
on
the
basis
of
invalid
claims,
the
statute
is
nevertheless
constitutional
and
that
we
would
advance
two
reasons
for
this.
in
the
first
place,
congress
could
assume
that
such
invalid
claims
are
going
to
be
comparatively
rare.
there
are
civil
and
criminal
penalties
for
false
filing
of
tax
returns
and
surely
in
almost
all
cases
this
will
deter
false
dependency
claims.
now,
furthermore,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
tax
dependent
amendment
was
one
of
the
underlying
rationales
for
the
tax
dependent
amendment
was
that
through
the
granting
of
a
tax
dependency
deduction,
congress
is
already
providing
support,
is
already
making
in
a
sense
a
payment
towards
the
support
of
the
tax
dependent
and
that
payment
is
made
whether
or
not
claims
is
invalid.
so
that
for
example,
if
food
stamps
were
issued
to
a
dependent
or
to
an
applicant
and
then
those
food
stamps
were
stolen,
the
government
presumably
would
not
be
required
to
reissue
food
stamps
on
a
basis
of
private
theft
of
that
nature.
similarly
we
would
feel
that
equal
protection
would
not
require
the
government
to
step
in
and
take
care
of
dependents
who
have
falsely
claimed.
the
other
three
appellees
in
the
case
as
we
say
were
granted
--
oh!
excuse,
were
denied
food
stamps
after
they
have
moved
out
of
their
parent’s
households
and
established
their
own
households.
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief,
it
is
not
our
understanding
that
food
stamps
should
be
denied
in
such
a
situation.
we’ve
discussed
the
statutory
interpretation.
we
believe
that
these
three
appellees
apparently
were
erroneously
denied
food
stamps.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
white.
insofar
as
all
appellees
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
by
issuing
food
stamps
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
these
applicants
are
scattered
throughout
the
country
as
far
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
i
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
--
i
suppose
if
they
would
come
in
to
apply
for
food
stamps
we
could
do
that
except
for
one
fact
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we
have
not
conceded
however
that
the
statute
denies
or
grants
food
stamps
when
the
taxpayer
dependency
claim
is
invalid.
we
would
not
issue
food
stamps
in
such
a
case,
however,
as
i
point
out
in
order
to
save
the
statute
if
it
were
necessary
to
do
so,
the
court
will
construe
the
statute
otherwise.
but
in
short
as
we
point
out,
these
appellees
may
well
be
entitled
to
relief
on
purely
statutory
grounds
in
which
case
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
claims.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
they
are
related
cases
which
this
court
took
together.
i
turn
now
from
these
threshold
matters
to
a
discussion
of
the
constitutional
issues
in
this
case.
the
appellees’
principal
challenge
to
the
statute
is
on
grounds
of
equal
protection.
in
the
standard
of
reviewing
equal
protection
cases
or
cases
involving
equal
protection
challenges
to
welfare
classifications
is
by
now
well
established.
a
welfare
classification
such
as
the
one
involved
here,
must
be
upheld
if
it
furthers
any
reasonable
purpose
which
maybe
attributed
to
the
legislature.
as
this
court
reiterated
last
month
in
ortwein
against
schwab
and
in
the
last
term
in
richardson
against
belcher
and
jefferson
against
hackney,
a
legislative
allocation
of
welfare
benefits
maybe
sustained,
must
be
sustained
if
it
is
shown
that
the
allocation
has
a
reasonable
basis
and
we
believe
that
this
tax
dependent
amendment
does
have
such
a
reasonable
basis.
as
a
matter
it
was
added
to
the
food
stamp
act,
only
after
congress
had
acquired
several
years
experience
with
the
administration
of
food
stamp
program.
and
during
those
years
it
had
become
apparent
that
although
the
program
generally
upgraded
in
a
satisfactory
manner,
it
was
subject
to
some
abuses.
by
1970,
many
congressmen
fear
that
unless
these
abuses
could
somehow
be
eliminated,
the
whole
program
might
be
terminated
as
a
result
of
rising
political
opposition.
one
of
the
most
significant
abuses
at
least
in
the
minds
of
many
congressmen
was
the
obtaining
and
use
of
food
stamps
by
the
college-age
children
of
higher
income
families
and
the
tax
dependent
amendment
represents
the
congressional
response
to
this
general
problem.
the
underlying
premises
of
this
amendment
are
that
the
food
stamp
program
was
not
intended
to
provide
welfare
assistance
to
college
students
and
other
young
adults
who
are
being
supported
by
parents
who
are
financially
better
off.
and
also,
that
when
these
parents
receive
a
tax
benefit
for
supporting
their
children,
they
have
assumed
the
primary
responsibility
for
making
certain
that
that
support
is
adequate.
in
short,
through
the
tax
deduction
the
government
has
already
in
essence
paid
for
the
support
of
these
young
people.
it
needn’t
provide
food
stamps
as
well.
so
the
effect
of
the
amendment
is
to
restrict
the
coverage
of
the
food
stamp
program
to
low
income
households
which
have
no
apparent
access
to
substantial
parental
support
and
with
respect
to
which
no
higher
income
family
is
obtaining
a
tax
benefit
and
we
submit
that
congress
had
the
right
to
choose
to
go
this
far
and
no
further
in
the
provision
of
food
stamp
assistance.
appellees’
equal
protection
argument
apparently
is
based
on
the
general
claim
that
even
if
this
statute
was
generally
effective
in
eliminating
the
abuses
with
which
congress
was
concerned,
it’s
nevertheless
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
denies
food
stamps
to
certain
needy
households.
we
concede
that
some
needy
households
maybe
denied
of
food
stamps,
but
we
don’t
invest
that
fact
of
constitutional
significance.
first,
i
think
it’s
appropriate
to
point
out
that
the
appellees
seem
to
have
exaggerated
the
effect
of
this
amendment.
they
propound
a
variety
of
hypothetical
cases,
but
they
fail
to
show
that
the
amendment
will
in
fact
bar
assistance
to
significant
numbers
of
needy
households.
to
the
contrary,
congress
could
recently
assume
the
very
few
truly
poor
households
containing
young
adult
who
in
fact
is
receiving
more
than
half
of
his
support
from
a
parent
who
is
not
himself
poor,
congress
could
determine
that
parents
who
receive
the
tax
benefits
with
dependency
exemption,
have
assumed
and
are
fulfilling
their
responsibility
to
support
their
children.
secondly,
a
welfare
classification
such
as
this
one
is
not
unconstitutional
simply
because
it
doesn’t
reach
all
persons
who
had
benefit
from
welfare
assistance.
as
this
court
has
often
noted,
a
welfare
classification
need
not
be
made
with
mathematical
precision.
thus
in
this
case,
if
the
food
stamp
program
fails
to
reach
all
needy
households
which
have
no
access
to
parental
support,
it’s
not
for
that
reason
alone
unconstitutional.
finally,
congress
can
limit
the
coverage
of
a
welfare
program
by
the
use
of
non-need
eligibility
criteria.
it
needn't
restrict
itself
to
the
use
of
need
as
the
sole
eligibility
criteria.
given
that
many
necessary
physical
restraints
on
welfare
expenditures,
congress
could
reasonably
determine
that
if
children
of
higher
income
parents,
when
the
parents
themselves
are
enjoying
tax
benefits
from
supporting
their
children
or
needy
that’s
primarily
the
responsibility
of
the
parents
and
perhaps
also
the
children
if
they're
voluntarily
unemployed.
but
it’s
not
necessarily,
it’s
not
constitutionally
the
responsibility
of
the
government.
congress
has
paid
for
the
support
of
these
children
in
a
sense
through
the
tax
deductions,
doesn’t
have
to
provide
food
stamps
as
well.
appellees’
claim
in
essence
is
that
the
government
should
be
required
to
pay
twice
for
their
support.
once
through
the
tax
deduction
and
then
a
second
time
through
the
food
stamps.
we
see
no
reasons,
tax
exemption
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
the
head
of
the
household
fills
out
the
form
and
the
form
requests
information
about
whether
a
parent
of
any
of
the
18
and
older
people
in
the
household
is
providing
support
and
if
so
if
they're
taking
the
young
person
as
a
tax
exemption.
if
the
applicant
answers
--
we
don't
know
whether
they're
taking
as
an
exemption,
they
are
providing
support
and
this
is
a
hypothetical,
then
the
administration,
food
&
nutrition
service
or
the
state
agency
administering
plan
sends
to
the
parent
a
form
which
the
parents
fill
out
and
the
parent
will
state
whether
or
not
he
is
providing
support
and
whether
or
not
he
is
now
claiming
the
child
as
a
tax
dependent.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
that’s
when
they
file
their
tax
return.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
that’s
not
the
way
it’s
been
administered
and
i
think
rightly
so.
the
--
you
can
make
a
claim
of
tax
dependency
simply
by
filling
out
the
w4
form
which
asks,
do
you
have
any
dependents
or
are
you
taking
any
dependents
and
for
withholding
purposes
therefore
you’ve
made
the
claim.
furthermore,
i
think
that
when
the
parent
fills
out
the
form
that’s
sent
to
him
from
the
state
agency,
but
he
is
in
fact
making
a
claim
purposes
of
the
food
stamp
program.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
“is
claimed”
and
we
contend
that
“is
claimed”
refers
to
any
claim
that
the
taxpayer
makes
whether
it’s
on
the
withholding
statement
or
in
the
form
provided
to
the
food
stamp
administrator.
so
there
is
a
contemporaneous
claim
which
enables
the
food
stamp
program
to
be
administered
on
a
current
basis.
the
appellees
argue
to
the
contrary
that
in
fact
it's
never
done
this
way
but
that
is
the
common
method
of
administration.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
common
method
of
administration
that
you
--
at
the
time
of
the
application
to
send
out
to
parents
who
request
or
stay
respond
to.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
only
if
the
information
provided
by
the
applicant
suggests
the
possibility
that
there
is
a
tax
dependent.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
generally
i
think
it
is
accepted
although
other
some
evidence
i
think
in
the
appendix
that
in
cases
where
it
looks
suspicious
they
will
nevertheless
request
that
the
parent’s
address
be
provided
in
--
the
food
service
does
make
an
inquiry
in
those
cases
as
well.
but
i
would
suspect
that
in
the
majority
of
cases,
an
answer
of
no
is
accepted.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
would
be
accepted
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
to
my
understanding
that
even
if
the
applicant
responds
yes
that
there
is
a
form
sent
to
the
--
the
taxpayer,
excuse
me,
dependent’s
parents
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
(voice
overlap)
you
really
can’t
speak
with
that
--
on
that
with
certainty.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
no,
not
--
on
that
basis,
they
would
not
be
denied
food
stamps.
then
a
further
question
is
asked
to
your
knowledge
is
the
taxpayer
taking
the
child
as
a
dependent?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
depends
upon
the
administrator.
i
suspect,
the
administrator
could
simply
accept
that
answer
or
he
could
make
a
further
inquiry
of
the
following.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
would
certainly
be
my
understanding
of
how
the
statute
should
operate.
now
one
of
the
appellees
claims
that
she
was
denied
food
stamps
even
though
the
taxpayer
was
--
just
couldn’t
be
found.
but
we
don’t
--
we’re
not
here
to
support
every
single
act
of
the
administrators
in
the
separate
states
and
i
think
in
some
cases
since
this
is
a
new
program,
there
are
obviously
problems
which
have
to
be
worked
out
yet.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
nothing
in
the
record
suggests
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
would
point
out
that
under
section
6103
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
tax
returns
could
be
obtained
by
the
secretary
for
a
spot
check
purpose.
i
think
that
it
was
represented
in
the
court
below
that
that
had
not
been
done
as
of
that
time.
and
i
don’t
know
whether
it’s
a
--
been
put
into
effect,
whether
the
department
of
agriculture
has
institutes
such
a
spot
check
program
but
it
could
be
done.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct.
but
to
summarize
our
position
on
the
question
of
equal
protection,
we
feel
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
tax
dependent
households
and
other
households.
tax
dependent
household
has
a
higher
income
parent
who
receives
a
tax
benefit
for
assuming
a
responsibility
of
supporting
his
child
in
the
tax
dependent
household.
other
households
have
no
such
advantage.
congress
could
reasonably
discriminate
between
these
households
as
it
has
done
in
the
(inaudible).
appellees
raised
one
other
constitutional
claim
which
they
raise
in
terms
of
procedural
due
process.
they
contend
that
the
amendment
amounts
to
an
arbitrary
presumption
that
they’re
not
needy
and
they
would
like
to
have
a
hearing
to
show
that
they’re
needy,
but
the
statutory
criteria
do
not
include
need
as
such.
for
example,
statute
makes
no
pretense
of
providing
or
attempting
to
provide
all
needy
persons
with
nutritional
assistance.
for
example,
most
households
without
cooking
facilities
are
denied
any
assistance
under
the
act,
no
matter
how
needy
they
may
be.
congress
was
not
concerned
with
the
need
in
enacting
this
amendment.
it
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
the
double
benefit
involved
with
tax
dependents.
therefore,
we
feel
that
this
purported
procedural
due
process
in
question
is
really
just
a
broad
claim
that
congress
may
not
establish
eligibility
criteria
based
on
any
considerations
other
than
need
alone
and
such
a
claim
has
nothing
to
do
with
procedural
due
process.
if
anything,
it
would
be
a
substantive
due
process
claim
that
the
congress
--
this
court
has
long
since
rejected.
but
insofar
as
it
could
be
viewed
as
an
equal
protection
claim
then
it’s
clearly
erroneous
because
as
this
court
settled
in
dandridge
against
williams,
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
prohibit
the
use
of
welfare
eligibility
criteria
based
on
factors
other
than
need.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
i’d
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
the
appellees
have
focused
on
the
need
of
the
applicant
household
and
it’s
understandable
why
they
would
do
that,
those
are
their
clients.
the
congress
however
was
concerned
about
the
cost
of
the
welfare
programs.
as
i
pointed
out,
congress
has
already
made
a
payment
in
order
to
provide
for
the
support
of
tax
dependent
households.
it's
made
it
through
the
tax
system
as
a
tax
deduction.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
and
therefore,
those
households
are
different
from
households
for
which
no
tax
exemption
is
provided.
congress
was
concerned
about
the
problem
of
double
benefit.
appellees
pay
no
attention
to
this
problem
and
insist
that
the
statute
has
no
rational
basis
because
some
needy
people
are
eliminated,
but
the
rational
basis
is
the
problem
of
double
benefit
which
congress
understandably
went
into
limit
or
eliminate.
furthermore,
i
would
point
out
that
appellees
in
their
briefs
in
here
have
simply
and
flatly
misstated
the
application
of
the
program.
a
tax
dependent’s
household
is
denied
food
stamps
during
the
year
of
the
tax
dependency
claim
and
not
just
for
the
following
year.
there
is
a
carryover
provision.
congress
believed
that
filing
of
the
tax
return
would
certainly
be
corroborative
evidence
and
could
be
used
in
furthering
the
purposes
of
this
provision.
it
could
presume
that
parental
support
under
most
circumstances
would
be
continued
but
the
primary
denial
of
benefits
is
during
the
year
of
the
dependency
claim.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
how
do
they
catch
up
with
that
file?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
for
example,
the
parent
says
during
the
year
in
which
the
applicant
first
comes
to
the
administration
that
no,
i’m
not
claiming
my
son
as
a
dependent
and
then
he
files
a
tax
return
in
the
following
year
claiming
the
son
is
dependent
then
it’s
unlikely
quite
frankly
that
he’ll
be
caught
unless
there
is
a
spot
check
or
a
thorough
check
of
the
returns
of
such
parents.
enforcement
system
obviously
would
not
be
perfect
but
a
mechanism
which
would
be
checking
through
the
tax
returns.
if
there
are
no
further
question.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
like
the
one
which
is
just
been
argued,
the
government
is
appealing
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
enjoining
enforcement
of
a
provision
of
the
food
stamp
act
on
constitutional
grounds.
provision
in
question
is
another
1971
amendment
to
the
act,
this
one
is
commonly
referred
to
as
the
tax
dependent
amendment.
generally
speaking,
the
amendment
provides
the
household
of
the
young
adult
was
claimed
by
his
parents
as
a
tax
dependent
is
not
eligible
to
participate
in
the
food
stamp
program
if
his
parents
themselves
do
not
qualify
for
food
stamp
assistance.
now
i
might
add
at
this
point
that
in
order
to
take
a
child
as
a
dependent
for
tax
purposes,
the
parent
must
provide
over
one
half
of
the
child
support.
the
eight
individual
appellees
here
brought
this
suit
as
a
class
action
alleging
that
they
had
been
excluded
from
participation
in
the
food
stamp
program
solely
by
virtue
of
the
operation
of
the
tax
dependent
amendment.
appellees
raise
no
question
of
statutory
interpretation
in
this
case
and
they
did
not
contest
the
applicability
of
the
statute
to
their
individual
cases.
they
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
solely
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
three-judge
court
held
the
provision
unconstitutional,
without
closely
analyzing
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
court
assumed
that
it
necessarily
acted
to
deny
food
stamps
on
the
valid
of
--
on
the
basis
of
invalid
taxpayer
dependency
claims.
court
considered
this
result
to
be
so
grossly
unfair,
in
the
court’s
terms,
as
to
constitute
both
the
denial
of
due
process
and
of
equal
protection.
court
therefore
enjoined
further
enforcement
in
implementation
of
the
tax
dependent
amendment.
as
we
have
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief,
this
case
presents
a
threshold
question
whether
adjudication
of
appellees’
constitutional
claims
as
appropriated
at
this
time.
it
now
appears
that
each
named
appellee
may
have
been
denied
food
stamps
solely
as
a
consequence
of
errors
in
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
tax
dependent
amendment.
we
have
set
forth
our
analysis
of
the
statutory
issues
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
will
not
discuss
them
at
length
here,
but
stated
very
briefly
five
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
were
denied
food
stamp
assistance
on
the
basis
solely
of
invalid
tax
payer
dependency
claims.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no
there
isn’t
and
it
has
been
the
administrative
interpretation
of
this
act
that
it
does
deny
food
stamps,
if
the
claim
of
an
injunction
is
made
and
there's
no
inquiry
into
it
whether
it
is
valid
or
invalid.
that
has
been
the
administrative
interpretation.
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
briefs,
the
statute
certainly
made
but
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
interpreted
in
that
way.
the
other
three
appellees
in
this
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
the
statute
is
construed
as
denying
food
stamps
on
the
basis
of
an
invalid
claim,
then
there
is
no
way
for
the
applicant
to
establish
that
their
claims
is
in
fact
--
that
that
the
tax
payer
claim
was
in
fact
invalid
and
if
they
should
receive
food
stamps,
that
is
correct.
the
statutory
language
talks
merely
in
terms
of
“is
claimed”
and
whether
that
imports
a
requirement
of
validity
is
an
open
question
i
would
think
at
this
time
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
it
concerns
me
in
the
sense
that
we
have
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
this
court
has
frequently
interpreted
statutes
so
as
to
avoid
constitutional
questions.
if
it
were
the
opinion
of
court
that
the
statute
would
be
invalid
as
so
construed
as
denying
food
stamps
on
the
basis
of
invalid
claims
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
interpret
it
as
not
denying
food
stamps
in
such
a
case.
and
i
think
that
such
an
interpretation
would
generally
accord
with
the
statutory
language,
and
would
not
do
a
violence.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
argued
that
even
if
it
is
construed
as
denying
food
stamps
on
the
basis
of
invalid
claims,
the
statute
is
nevertheless
constitutional
and
that
we
would
advance
two
reasons
for
this.
in
the
first
place,
congress
could
assume
that
such
invalid
claims
are
going
to
be
comparatively
rare.
there
are
civil
and
criminal
penalties
for
false
filing
of
tax
returns
and
surely
in
almost
all
cases
this
will
deter
false
dependency
claims.
now,
furthermore,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
tax
dependent
amendment
was
one
of
the
underlying
rationales
for
the
tax
dependent
amendment
was
that
through
the
granting
of
a
tax
dependency
deduction,
congress
is
already
providing
support,
is
already
making
in
a
sense
a
payment
towards
the
support
of
the
tax
dependent
and
that
payment
is
made
whether
or
not
claims
is
invalid.
so
that
for
example,
if
food
stamps
were
issued
to
a
dependent
or
to
an
applicant
and
then
those
food
stamps
were
stolen,
the
government
presumably
would
not
be
required
to
reissue
food
stamps
on
a
basis
of
private
theft
of
that
nature.
similarly
we
would
feel
that
equal
protection
would
not
require
the
government
to
step
in
and
take
care
of
dependents
who
have
falsely
claimed.
the
other
three
appellees
in
the
case
as
we
say
were
granted
--
oh!
excuse,
were
denied
food
stamps
after
they
have
moved
out
of
their
parent’s
households
and
established
their
own
households.
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief,
it
is
not
our
understanding
that
food
stamps
should
be
denied
in
such
a
situation.
we’ve
discussed
the
statutory
interpretation.
we
believe
that
these
three
appellees
apparently
were
erroneously
denied
food
stamps.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
white.
insofar
as
all
appellees
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
by
issuing
food
stamps
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
these
applicants
are
scattered
throughout
the
country
as
far
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
i
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
--
i
suppose
if
they
would
come
in
to
apply
for
food
stamps
we
could
do
that
except
for
one
fact
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we
have
not
conceded
however
that
the
statute
denies
or
grants
food
stamps
when
the
taxpayer
dependency
claim
is
invalid.
we
would
not
issue
food
stamps
in
such
a
case,
however,
as
i
point
out
in
order
to
save
the
statute
if
it
were
necessary
to
do
so,
the
court
will
construe
the
statute
otherwise.
but
in
short
as
we
point
out,
these
appellees
may
well
be
entitled
to
relief
on
purely
statutory
grounds
in
which
case
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
claims.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
they
are
related
cases
which
this
court
took
together.
i
turn
now
from
these
threshold
matters
to
a
discussion
of
the
constitutional
issues
in
this
case.
the
appellees’
principal
challenge
to
the
statute
is
on
grounds
of
equal
protection.
in
the
standard
of
reviewing
equal
protection
cases
or
cases
involving
equal
protection
challenges
to
welfare
classifications
is
by
now
well
established.
a
welfare
classification
such
as
the
one
involved
here,
must
be
upheld
if
it
furthers
any
reasonable
purpose
which
maybe
attributed
to
the
legislature.
as
this
court
reiterated
last
month
in
ortwein
against
schwab
and
in
the
last
term
in
richardson
against
belcher
and
jefferson
against
hackney,
a
legislative
allocation
of
welfare
benefits
maybe
sustained,
must
be
sustained
if
it
is
shown
that
the
allocation
has
a
reasonable
basis
and
we
believe
that
this
tax
dependent
amendment
does
have
such
a
reasonable
basis.
as
a
matter
it
was
added
to
the
food
stamp
act,
only
after
congress
had
acquired
several
years
experience
with
the
administration
of
food
stamp
program.
and
during
those
years
it
had
become
apparent
that
although
the
program
generally
upgraded
in
a
satisfactory
manner,
it
was
subject
to
some
abuses.
by
1970,
many
congressmen
fear
that
unless
these
abuses
could
somehow
be
eliminated,
the
whole
program
might
be
terminated
as
a
result
of
rising
political
opposition.
one
of
the
most
significant
abuses
at
least
in
the
minds
of
many
congressmen
was
the
obtaining
and
use
of
food
stamps
by
the
college-age
children
of
higher
income
families
and
the
tax
dependent
amendment
represents
the
congressional
response
to
this
general
problem.
the
underlying
premises
of
this
amendment
are
that
the
food
stamp
program
was
not
intended
to
provide
welfare
assistance
to
college
students
and
other
young
adults
who
are
being
supported
by
parents
who
are
financially
better
off.
and
also,
that
when
these
parents
receive
a
tax
benefit
for
supporting
their
children,
they
have
assumed
the
primary
responsibility
for
making
certain
that
that
support
is
adequate.
in
short,
through
the
tax
deduction
the
government
has
already
in
essence
paid
for
the
support
of
these
young
people.
it
needn’t
provide
food
stamps
as
well.
so
the
effect
of
the
amendment
is
to
restrict
the
coverage
of
the
food
stamp
program
to
low
income
households
which
have
no
apparent
access
to
substantial
parental
support
and
with
respect
to
which
no
higher
income
family
is
obtaining
a
tax
benefit
and
we
submit
that
congress
had
the
right
to
choose
to
go
this
far
and
no
further
in
the
provision
of
food
stamp
assistance.
appellees’
equal
protection
argument
apparently
is
based
on
the
general
claim
that
even
if
this
statute
was
generally
effective
in
eliminating
the
abuses
with
which
congress
was
concerned,
it’s
nevertheless
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
denies
food
stamps
to
certain
needy
households.
we
concede
that
some
needy
households
maybe
denied
of
food
stamps,
but
we
don’t
invest
that
fact
of
constitutional
significance.
first,
i
think
it’s
appropriate
to
point
out
that
the
appellees
seem
to
have
exaggerated
the
effect
of
this
amendment.
they
propound
a
variety
of
hypothetical
cases,
but
they
fail
to
show
that
the
amendment
will
in
fact
bar
assistance
to
significant
numbers
of
needy
households.
to
the
contrary,
congress
could
recently
assume
the
very
few
truly
poor
households
containing
young
adult
who
in
fact
is
receiving
more
than
half
of
his
support
from
a
parent
who
is
not
himself
poor,
congress
could
determine
that
parents
who
receive
the
tax
benefits
with
dependency
exemption,
have
assumed
and
are
fulfilling
their
responsibility
to
support
their
children.
secondly,
a
welfare
classification
such
as
this
one
is
not
unconstitutional
simply
because
it
doesn’t
reach
all
persons
who
had
benefit
from
welfare
assistance.
as
this
court
has
often
noted,
a
welfare
classification
need
not
be
made
with
mathematical
precision.
thus
in
this
case,
if
the
food
stamp
program
fails
to
reach
all
needy
households
which
have
no
access
to
parental
support,
it’s
not
for
that
reason
alone
unconstitutional.
finally,
congress
can
limit
the
coverage
of
a
welfare
program
by
the
use
of
non-need
eligibility
criteria.
it
needn't
restrict
itself
to
the
use
of
need
as
the
sole
eligibility
criteria.
given
that
many
necessary
physical
restraints
on
welfare
expenditures,
congress
could
reasonably
determine
that
if
children
of
higher
income
parents,
when
the
parents
themselves
are
enjoying
tax
benefits
from
supporting
their
children
or
needy
that’s
primarily
the
responsibility
of
the
parents
and
perhaps
also
the
children
if
they're
voluntarily
unemployed.
but
it’s
not
necessarily,
it’s
not
constitutionally
the
responsibility
of
the
government.
congress
has
paid
for
the
support
of
these
children
in
a
sense
through
the
tax
deductions,
doesn’t
have
to
provide
food
stamps
as
well.
appellees’
claim
in
essence
is
that
the
government
should
be
required
to
pay
twice
for
their
support.
once
through
the
tax
deduction
and
then
a
second
time
through
the
food
stamps.
we
see
no
reasons,
tax
exemption
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
the
head
of
the
household
fills
out
the
form
and
the
form
requests
information
about
whether
a
parent
of
any
of
the
18
and
older
people
in
the
household
is
providing
support
and
if
so
if
they're
taking
the
young
person
as
a
tax
exemption.
if
the
applicant
answers
--
we
don't
know
whether
they're
taking
as
an
exemption,
they
are
providing
support
and
this
is
a
hypothetical,
then
the
administration,
food
&
nutrition
service
or
the
state
agency
administering
plan
sends
to
the
parent
a
form
which
the
parents
fill
out
and
the
parent
will
state
whether
or
not
he
is
providing
support
and
whether
or
not
he
is
now
claiming
the
child
as
a
tax
dependent.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
that’s
when
they
file
their
tax
return.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
that’s
not
the
way
it’s
been
administered
and
i
think
rightly
so.
the
--
you
can
make
a
claim
of
tax
dependency
simply
by
filling
out
the
w4
form
which
asks,
do
you
have
any
dependents
or
are
you
taking
any
dependents
and
for
withholding
purposes
therefore
you’ve
made
the
claim.
furthermore,
i
think
that
when
the
parent
fills
out
the
form
that’s
sent
to
him
from
the
state
agency,
but
he
is
in
fact
making
a
claim
purposes
of
the
food
stamp
program.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
“is
claimed”
and
we
contend
that
“is
claimed”
refers
to
any
claim
that
the
taxpayer
makes
whether
it’s
on
the
withholding
statement
or
in
the
form
provided
to
the
food
stamp
administrator.
so
there
is
a
contemporaneous
claim
which
enables
the
food
stamp
program
to
be
administered
on
a
current
basis.
the
appellees
argue
to
the
contrary
that
in
fact
it's
never
done
this
way
but
that
is
the
common
method
of
administration.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
common
method
of
administration
that
you
--
at
the
time
of
the
application
to
send
out
to
parents
who
request
or
stay
respond
to.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
only
if
the
information
provided
by
the
applicant
suggests
the
possibility
that
there
is
a
tax
dependent.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
generally
i
think
it
is
accepted
although
other
some
evidence
i
think
in
the
appendix
that
in
cases
where
it
looks
suspicious
they
will
nevertheless
request
that
the
parent’s
address
be
provided
in
--
the
food
service
does
make
an
inquiry
in
those
cases
as
well.
but
i
would
suspect
that
in
the
majority
of
cases,
an
answer
of
no
is
accepted.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
would
be
accepted
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
to
my
understanding
that
even
if
the
applicant
responds
yes
that
there
is
a
form
sent
to
the
--
the
taxpayer,
excuse
me,
dependent’s
parents
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
(voice
overlap)
you
really
can’t
speak
with
that
--
on
that
with
certainty.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
no,
not
--
on
that
basis,
they
would
not
be
denied
food
stamps.
then
a
further
question
is
asked
to
your
knowledge
is
the
taxpayer
taking
the
child
as
a
dependent?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
depends
upon
the
administrator.
i
suspect,
the
administrator
could
simply
accept
that
answer
or
he
could
make
a
further
inquiry
of
the
following.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
would
certainly
be
my
understanding
of
how
the
statute
should
operate.
now
one
of
the
appellees
claims
that
she
was
denied
food
stamps
even
though
the
taxpayer
was
--
just
couldn’t
be
found.
but
we
don’t
--
we’re
not
here
to
support
every
single
act
of
the
administrators
in
the
separate
states
and
i
think
in
some
cases
since
this
is
a
new
program,
there
are
obviously
problems
which
have
to
be
worked
out
yet.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
nothing
in
the
record
suggests
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
would
point
out
that
under
section
6103
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
tax
returns
could
be
obtained
by
the
secretary
for
a
spot
check
purpose.
i
think
that
it
was
represented
in
the
court
below
that
that
had
not
been
done
as
of
that
time.
and
i
don’t
know
whether
it’s
a
--
been
put
into
effect,
whether
the
department
of
agriculture
has
institutes
such
a
spot
check
program
but
it
could
be
done.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct.
but
to
summarize
our
position
on
the
question
of
equal
protection,
we
feel
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
tax
dependent
households
and
other
households.
tax
dependent
household
has
a
higher
income
parent
who
receives
a
tax
benefit
for
assuming
a
responsibility
of
supporting
his
child
in
the
tax
dependent
household.
other
households
have
no
such
advantage.
congress
could
reasonably
discriminate
between
these
households
as
it
has
done
in
the
(inaudible).
appellees
raised
one
other
constitutional
claim
which
they
raise
in
terms
of
procedural
due
process.
they
contend
that
the
amendment
amounts
to
an
arbitrary
presumption
that
they’re
not
needy
and
they
would
like
to
have
a
hearing
to
show
that
they’re
needy,
but
the
statutory
criteria
do
not
include
need
as
such.
for
example,
statute
makes
no
pretense
of
providing
or
attempting
to
provide
all
needy
persons
with
nutritional
assistance.
for
example,
most
households
without
cooking
facilities
are
denied
any
assistance
under
the
act,
no
matter
how
needy
they
may
be.
congress
was
not
concerned
with
the
need
in
enacting
this
amendment.
it
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
the
double
benefit
involved
with
tax
dependents.
therefore,
we
feel
that
this
purported
procedural
due
process
in
question
is
really
just
a
broad
claim
that
congress
may
not
establish
eligibility
criteria
based
on
any
considerations
other
than
need
alone
and
such
a
claim
has
nothing
to
do
with
procedural
due
process.
if
anything,
it
would
be
a
substantive
due
process
claim
that
the
congress
--
this
court
has
long
since
rejected.
but
insofar
as
it
could
be
viewed
as
an
equal
protection
claim
then
it’s
clearly
erroneous
because
as
this
court
settled
in
dandridge
against
williams,
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
prohibit
the
use
of
welfare
eligibility
criteria
based
on
factors
other
than
need.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
i’d
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
the
appellees
have
focused
on
the
need
of
the
applicant
household
and
it’s
understandable
why
they
would
do
that,
those
are
their
clients.
the
congress
however
was
concerned
about
the
cost
of
the
welfare
programs.
as
i
pointed
out,
congress
has
already
made
a
payment
in
order
to
provide
for
the
support
of
tax
dependent
households.
it's
made
it
through
the
tax
system
as
a
tax
deduction.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
and
therefore,
those
households
are
different
from
households
for
which
no
tax
exemption
is
provided.
congress
was
concerned
about
the
problem
of
double
benefit.
appellees
pay
no
attention
to
this
problem
and
insist
that
the
statute
has
no
rational
basis
because
some
needy
people
are
eliminated,
but
the
rational
basis
is
the
problem
of
double
benefit
which
congress
understandably
went
into
limit
or
eliminate.
furthermore,
i
would
point
out
that
appellees
in
their
briefs
in
here
have
simply
and
flatly
misstated
the
application
of
the
program.
a
tax
dependent’s
household
is
denied
food
stamps
during
the
year
of
the
tax
dependency
claim
and
not
just
for
the
following
year.
there
is
a
carryover
provision.
congress
believed
that
filing
of
the
tax
return
would
certainly
be
corroborative
evidence
and
could
be
used
in
furthering
the
purposes
of
this
provision.
it
could
presume
that
parental
support
under
most
circumstances
would
be
continued
but
the
primary
denial
of
benefits
is
during
the
year
of
the
dependency
claim.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
how
do
they
catch
up
with
that
file?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
for
example,
the
parent
says
during
the
year
in
which
the
applicant
first
comes
to
the
administration
that
no,
i’m
not
claiming
my
son
as
a
dependent
and
then
he
files
a
tax
return
in
the
following
year
claiming
the
son
is
dependent
then
it’s
unlikely
quite
frankly
that
he’ll
be
caught
unless
there
is
a
spot
check
or
a
thorough
check
of
the
returns
of
such
parents.
enforcement
system
obviously
would
not
be
perfect
but
a
mechanism
which
would
be
checking
through
the
tax
returns.
if
there
are
no
further
question.
