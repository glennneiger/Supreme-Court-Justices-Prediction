mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
concentrate
at
the
outset
the
appellant’s
noble
claim
and
that
is
a
question
that
there
is
no
standing
by
any
of
the
appellees
in
this
case.
appellees
would
just
like
to
seek
averted
decision
on
the
constitutionality
on
the
statute
because
they
say
that
the
statute
was
improperly
administered
rather
than
the
statute
itself
violates
equal
protection.
in
order
to
do
this,
they
raise
two
new
interpretations
of
the
statute,
interpretations
of
the
statute
that
differ
from
the
way
they
interpreted
the
statute
in
the
district
court.
in
fact,
interpretation
that
is
different
from
the
way
they
interpret
the
act
currently.
they
say
that
a
fraudulent
tax
claim
may
not
necessarily
disqualify
people
in
a
dependent
household.
well,
your
honors,
it’s
absolutely
clear
that
the
statute
itself
disqualifies
a
household
containing
a
dependent
even
if
that
dependent
was
claimed
fraudulently.
if
you
look
at
the
statute;
the
statute
says
very
clearly,
“any
household
which
includes
a
member
who
has
reached
his
18th
birthday
and
who
is
claimed
as
a
dependent
child
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
by
a
taxpayer
who
is
not
a
member
of
an
eligible
household
shall
be
ineligible
to
participate
in
any
food
stamp
program,
established
pursuant
to
this
chapter
during
the
tax
period
such
dependency
is
claimed
and
for
a
period
of
one
year
after
expiration
of
such
period.
appellants
admit
that
their
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
a
fraudulently
claimed
dependency
household
is
eliminated
from
the
food
stamp
program.
in
fact,
that’s
the
way
they
currently
administer
the
program.
if
this
case
were
reverse,
this
is
precisely
the
way
the
program
would
continue
to
operate.
appellants
forget
that
a
court
should
deference
to
administrating
agency's
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
this
is
precisely
the
way
that
the
department
of
agriculture
interprets
the
statute.
their
regulations
eliminate
fraudulently
claimed
dependent
households.
their
instructions
eliminate
fraudulently
claimed
dependent
households.
in
fact,
the
acting
administrator
of
the
food
&
nutrition
service,
mr.
howard
davis,
in
his
affidavit
and
you’ll
find
that
on
page
83
of
the
appendix,
he
says,
“there
are
no
factual
issues
to
be
presented
or
challenged
other
than
the
issue
of
whether
of
not
a
member
of
the
household
has
been
claimed
as
a
dependent
child.”
in
fact,
appellant’s
argument
in
the
district
court
was
that
it
is
illegal
to
check
into
the
tax
returns.
they
said
that
disclosure
to
the
dependent
or
to
the
food
stamp
office
as
to
whether
the
claim
was
proper
or
improper
is
impermissible
under
the
tax
statutes.
you’ll
find
that
statement
in
appendix
b
to
our
brief,
pages
22b
through
24b.
however,
even
if
this
court
wanted
to
fictionalize
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
change
the
way
this
agency,
the
department
of
agriculture
has
interpreted
this
provision
from
the
outset,
it
would
still
be
five
appellees
at
the
very
least
who
would
still
be
harmed
by
the
operation
of
the
statute.
appellees
alderete,
appellee
murry,
appellee
valdez,
appellee
broderson,
appellee
schultz.
appellee
murry
is
an
example
receives
only
$57.50
per
month,
that’s
the
only
income
she
has.
that
income
is
derived
from
her
ex-husband.
her
ex-husband
cannot
provide
any
additional
support
because
he
has
remarried.
he’s
got
two
children.
he’s
supporting
them
on
a
small
laborer's
wages.
she
receives
all
of
her
income
from
this
ex-husband
and
her
ex-husband
appropriately
has
claimed
her
as
a
tax
dependent.
consequently,
she
has
standing.
now,
the
appellants
have
said
that
the
food
stamp
benefits
she
gets,
that
those
food
stamp
benefits
should
be
included
in
the
determination
of
whether
the
household
receives
more
than
50%
of
its
income
from
the
claimant.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes,
however,
everyone
in
the
household
is
denied
food
stamps.
in
other
words,
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
person
over
18
years
of
age
in
mrs.
murry’s
household
who
is
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
there
is
a
young
child
by
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
18
years
of
age,
i
think
his
name
is
jordan
murry,
and
that
child
has
been
claimed
as
a
tax
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
right.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
right
but
everyone
in
the
household
is
denied
of
food
stamp.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
now,
appellee
--
appellant’s
misstate
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
the
statute
operates
only
because
one
of
the
children
was
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent,
not
because
one
of
the
grandchildren
was
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent.
the
appellants
would
have
us
believe
that
because
mrs.
murry
has
received
some
food
stamps,
that
those
food
stamp
benefits
should
be
included
in
determining
whether
the
taxpayer
who
made
the
claim
has
given
50%
to
the
income.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
the
statute
is
very
clear
on
this
issue.
look
at
section
2016
(c)
of
title
7.
it
says,
“the
value
of
the
coupon
allotment
provided
to
any
eligible
household
which
is
in
excess
of
the
amount
charged
such
households
for
such
allotment
shall
not
be
considered
to
be
income
or
resources
for
any
purpose
under
federal
or
state
laws
including
but
not
limited
to
laws
relating
to
taxation,
welfare
and
public
assistance
programs.”
the
only
provision
that
the
appellant
cite
to
the
contrary
is
a
tax
ruling
which
they
cite
at
page
3,
note
1.
that
ruling
however
has
absolutely
no
application
to
that
case
--
to
this
case.
that
ruling
merely
refers
to
“state
benefit
payments
measured
solely
by
a
recipient’s
needs.”
these
are
not
state
welfare
benefits.
these
are
federal
benefits.
all
of
the
benefits
are
subsidized
by
the
federal
government.
at
the
very
least
your
honors
there
are
five
appellees
who
are
not
harmed
because
of
the
wrongful
administration
of
the
statute.
they
are
harmed
because
of
the
statute
itself.
appellants'
other
new
statutory
interpretation
is
that
they
say
for
the
provision
to
operate,
you
do
not
have
to
have
been
outside
the
taxpayer
claimants
house
during
part
of
the
tax
year.
they
say
if
you
are
outside
of
the
household,
during
the
carryover
year,
the
year
after
the
period
for
which
the
tax
dependency
was
claimed,
but
you
were
not
outside
of
the
household
during
the
period
for
the
tax
dependency
claim,
then
you
should
not
have
been
denied
food
stamps.
however,
even
if
this
new
statutory
interpretation
was
accepted
by
the
court,
every
single
one
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
would
still
be
operate
--
would
still
be
harmed
by
the
operation
of
the
statute.
it
is
clear
that
this
case
is
not
moot,
it’s
a
very
live
controversy.
turning
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
it’s
clear
that
this
provision
was
designed
to
eliminate
non-needy
households
from
the
food
stamp
program.
however,
the
tax
dependency
provision
is
not
reasonably
related
to
that
purpose
at
all.
as
district
judge
hart
said,
he
said
that,
“eliminating
the
voluntary
poor
from
the
program
or
those
people
who
have
access
to
a
nutritional
adequacy,
that
operation
really
required
the
utilization
of
a
surgeon
scalpel.”
and
what
was
done
with
the
statute
was
congress
wound
up
using
a
meat
cleaver
and
started
eliminating
the
needy
people
from
the
program,
not
the
un-needy
from
the
program.
the
statute
completely
missed
in
its
statutory
objective.
the
tax
dependency
provision
is
wholly
unrelated
to
an
assessment
of
a
household’s
current
needs.
although
the
entire
food
stamp
program
operates
on
the
basis
of
current
circumstances,
the
provision
is
not
at
all
related
to
what
one's
current
circumstances
actually
are,
but
the
program
works
on
the
basis
of
current
circumstances.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
you’ll
find
that
your
honor
on
page
50
of
my
brief.
it’s
in
the
footnote
and
in
the
text.
there
are
two
different
statements
that
he
made.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
that
is
not
part
of
the
opinion.
that
was
part
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
district
court
and
i
have
provided
in
appendix
b
the
transcript
of
that
oral
argument
and
i
quoted
there
from.
this
program
operates
on
the
basis
of
current
need
is
clear.
certification
periods
are
very
short.
certification
periods
are
essentially
three
months
under
the
program
and
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
an
assessment
of
what
the
current
circumstances
of
a
household
are.
if
you
were
illegible
on
the
basis
of
current
income
or
if
you
were
--
if
you
have
current
resources
that
make
you
needy
then
you
are
illegible
for
the
food
stamp
program.
similarly,
even
if
you
refused
to
qualify
under
the
work
requirement
previously
if
you
are
now
willing
to
comply
with
the
work
requirement
you
are
ineligible
for
food
stamps.
clearly,
the
program
operates
on
the
basis
of
current
circumstances.
well,
this
provision
is
not
at
all
related
to
an
assessment
of
an
individual’s
current
need.
in
fact,
contrary
to
what
the
appellants
have
indicated,
this
provision
operates
on
the
basis
of
a
tax
dependency
claim
that
is
made
in
april
or
march
of
the
tax
year.
in
fact,
they
so
indicated
you’ll
find
that
in
the
appendix
at
page
81,
when
they
gave
an
example
of
how
the
provision
operates
and
you’ll
also
see
that’s
the
way
they
claim
the
way
provision
operates
and
that’s
in
our
appendix
to
the
brief,
appendix
17b.
what
happens
is,
you
are
denied
food
stamps
on
the
basis
of
a
tax
dependency
claim
that
is
made
in
april
or
march
subsequent
to
the
period
of
the
tax
year
for
which
you
are
making
the
claim.
consequently,
when
the
claim
is
made
the
tax
year
is
already
over.
the
period
is
an
entire
nullity
with
regard
to
the
tax
year
for
which
the
dependency
claim
was
made.
you
have
received
food
stamps
during
that
year.
in
other
words,
the
provision
only
operates
during
the
subsequent
year,
the
so-called
carryover
year
and
the
provision
rigidly
denies
you
food
stamps
during
the
year
after
the
period
for
which
the
dependency
claim
was
made.
in
fact,
all
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
were
denied
assistance
during
the
carryover
year,
not
the
year
for
which
the
dependency
claim
was
made
but
during
the
carryover
year.
in
fact,
every
one
is
essentially
affected
exclusively
during
the
carryover
year
and
the
tax
dependency
claim
has
absolutely
no
relationship
to
what
is
occurring
in
that
carryover
year.
at
best,
it
has
some
relationship
to
what
happened
during
the
preceding
year
for
which
that
the
tax
dependency
claim
was
made.
but
your
honors,
i
think
what
is
even
more
important
is
that
a
tax
dependency
claim
has
absolutely
no
correlation
to
a
household’s
actual
availability
of
income
and
that’s
because
under
the
tax
dependency
provision,
there
is
no
minimum
support
that
need
be
provided.
you
only
need
to
provide
over
50%
of
your
income.
in
other
words,
if
a
household
has
absolutely
no
income
at
all
and
the
taxpayer
gave
one
dollar
to
that
household
then
the
taxpayer
has
a
right
to
make
a
tax
dependency
claim
for
that
year.
despite
the
fact
that
that
household
has
only
one
dollar
of
income
for
that
entire
year,
they
are
denied
food
stamps
because
they
were
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
and
in
fact
properly
so
because
they
gave
over
50%
of
the
income
if
that
household
has
absolutely
no
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
for
non-students,
this
provision
is
entirely
arbitrary.
in
order
to
be
declared
a
tax
dependent,
a
non-student
must
have
income
under
$750.00.
if
a
non-student
has
income
over
$750,
you
cannot
claim
them
as
a
tax
dependent.
consequently,
if
you
were
--
if
you
gave
more
than
$750.00,
you
can
declare
a
non-student
as
a
tax
dependent
and
you
can
see
if
you
accumulate
that
--
the
student’s
income
or
the
non-students’
income
and
the
amount
provided
by
the
taxpayer,
it
still
provides
you
far
short
of
the
standards
of
need
that
are
established
by
the
appellants
on
this
case.
take
as
an
example,
the
six-person
eligibility
standard
under
the
food
stamp
program.
for
a
six-person
household
to
be
eligible
for
food
stamps,
you
must
have
an
annual
income
of
under
$6,084.00.
clearly,
a
non-student
is
a
very
substantial
likelihood.
in
fact,
there’s
a
probably
--
there's
a
probability
that
a
non-student
who
was
claimed
as
a
dependent
is
still
needy
under
the
appellant’s
own
standards.
nevertheless
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
between
the
ages
of
18
and
19,
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
if
you
are
over
19
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
if
you’re
18
or
19,
what
i
said
does
not
apply.
once
you
are
over
19,
it
does.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
now,
you
can
never
demonstrate
throughout
the
entire
administrative
process
that
you
have
absolutely
no
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
take
appellee
lula
mae
murry
as
an
example.
her
5%
household
receives
as
a
total
$57.50
per
month
in
income
of
which
$25.00
is
paid
directly
for
rent
and
then
she
pays
$18.50
for
her
utility
bill.
for
all
of
her
other
expenses,
that
includes
clothing,
medical
expenses,
school
supplies,
transportation,
household
supplies,
hygienic
items,
she
has
merely
nine
cents
a
person
per
day.
obviously,
she
cannot
purchase
a
nutritionally
adequate
diet.
she
cannot
live
without
receiving
some
kind
of
assistance.
she
needs
the
food
stamp
program.
indeed,
she
had
been
receiving
food
stamps
before.
she
had
been
receiving
$128.00
in
benefits
and
she
was
paying
for
that
only
$11.00.
that
was
what
permitted
her
to
survive.
but
because
of
the
fact
that
her
ex-husband
has
claimed
one
of
their
children
as
a
tax
dependent
every
one
in
the
household
is
denied
of
food
stamps.
it
is
presumed
in
essence
that
that
family
has
access
to
adequate
income
to
purchase
a
nutritionally
adequate
diet.
take
as
an
example
appellee
schultz.
appellee
schultz
has
absolutely
no
income
whatsoever.
she
doesn’t
have
a
single
penny
in
income.
in
fact,
she
has
been
in
a
hospital
for
four
months
suffering
from
malnutrition
because
all
she
was
leaving
on
was
wild
sweet
potatoes
and
water.
and
she’s
been
in
the
hospital
very
sick
because
she
did
not
have
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
nevertheless,
because
she
was
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
in
the
previous
year
and
despite
the
fact
that
she
receives
no
assistance
during
the
current
year
she
is
denied
food
stamps
during
this
current
year,
the
so-called
carryover
year.
your
honor,
the
one-year
carryover
period
is
also
extremely
rigid.
even
if
one
can
convincingly
demonstrate
that
the
taxpayer
cannot
provide
any
support
whatsoever
during
this
carryover
year
but
is
still
denied
food
stamps
by
virtue
of
the
tax
dependency
claim
of
the
previous
year.
even
if
one
can
convincingly
demonstrate
that
one
is
not
going
to
be
taking
a
tax
dependency
claim
for
this
year,
one
is
denied
food
stamps
during
the
carryover
year.
in
fact,
even
if
once
swore,
the
taxpayer
swore
that
a
dependency
claim
is
not
going
to
be
made
in
the
carryover
year,
people
are
denied
food
stamps
during
that
carryover
year.
it’s
a
very
rigid
provision
if
you
are
denied
food
stamps
during
that
carryover
year.
take
as
an
example
appellee
joe
ben
valdez.
his
father
took
him
as
a
tax
dependent
in
the
previous
year,
so
5%
of
the
household
that
his
father
is
a
head
of,
a
$450.00
of
income
of
which
they
have
$497.00
of
expenses
because
they
have
very
substantial
debts.
mr.
valdez
has
diabetes
and
an
ulcerous
condition
and
he
cannot
provide
any
support
for
the
tax
dependent’s
household.
nevertheless,
appellee’s
household
was
denied
food
stamps
even
though
they
can
convincingly
demonstrate
that
no
--
the
tax
dependency
claim
will
be
made
this
year.
even
though
they
can
convincingly
demonstrate
that
no
support
at
all
is
being
provided
this
year,
they
are
denied
food
stamps.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
there
is
no
remedy
whatsoever.
and
what
makes
that
even
clearer
your
honor,
if
you
take
a
look
at
our
appendix
a
you’ll
note
that
a
child
over
18
years
of
age
by
and
large
cannot
receive
--
cannot
legally
compel
support
from
a
taxpayer.
the
reason
is
that
in
the
majority
of
the
states
your
legal
liability
to
support
your
child
ends
at
18
years
of
age
so
that
in
the
situation
that
you
raise
mr.
justice
marshall,
even
let’s
say
there
was
a
fraudulent
tax
claim,
the
father
is
in
jail,
it’s
clear
that
he
made
a
fraudulent
tax
claim.
it’s
clear
that
the
household
is
denied
of
food
stamps
solely
because
of
his
fault.
there’s
just
nothing
that
can
be
done
to
help
the
tax
dependent’s
household.
they
are
rigidly
and
i
would
say
arbitrarily
denied
food
stamps.
they
have
no
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
the
father
can’t
support
them
in
jail.
he
never
had
any
intention
to
support
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
excuse
me.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
what
i
am
saying
however
is
that’s
not
reasonably
related
to
any
purpose.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
you
wanted
to
create
a
pure
fiction,
i
suppose
you
could.
however
the
administrative
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
mean
your
honor,
what
in
essence
you’re
doing
is
you’re
saying
the
provision
is
so
irrational
that
therefore
we’re
going
to
try
and
legislate
it
and
make
it
rationale.
well,
the
whole
equal
protection
argument
that
we’re
making
is
that
the
provision
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
don’t
know
of
an
instance,
your
honor
where
both
parties
agree
on
what
the
statute
says
and
the
court
wound
up
coming
up
with
a
new
interpretation
of
the
statute
just
to
save
the
statute.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
okay.
your
honor
even
if
you
read
into
the
provision
that
a
fraudulent
tax
claim
does
not
deny
food
stamps.
but
that
is
an
improper
administration
of
the
statute,
i
would
still
say
that
the
statute
is
arbitrary.
there’s
no
implication
whatsoever
that
because
the
tax
dependency
claim
was
made
that
the
tax
dependent’s
household
has
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
as
i
indicated
before,
if
a
household
has
no
income
at
all,
take
christie
schultz
as
an
example.
she
has
no
income
whatsoever.
if
her
parents
gave
her
merely
one
dollar,
then
they
could
probably
claim
christie
as
a
tax
dependent
and
as
a
result
of
merely
one
dollar
per
year
she
would
be
denied
food
stamps.
even
if
she
can
show
during
the
carryover
year
that
she’s
not
going
to
be
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent
she
is
going
to
be
denied
of
food
stamps.
your
honors,
it
seems
me
that
this
carryover
provision,
this
one
year
carryover
even
when
one
can
show
that
one
will
not
be
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
during
that
carryover
year
is
essentially
the
same
kind
of
blunderbuss
one
year
in
eligibility
system
that
was
scored
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
in
shapiro
v.
thompson,
you
also
indicated
that
that
provision,
the
one
year
durational
residence
requirement
would’ve
been
invalid
even
under
the
traditional
equal
protection
standard.
under
the
traditional
equal
protection
standard,
i
would
submit
that
this
case
is
stronger
than
the
one
in
shapiro
for
the
reason
that
in
shapiro
the
one
year
ineligibility
at
least
served
a
purpose.
it
served
the
purpose
of
deterring
fraud.
here,
the
one-year
carryover
provision
serves
no
purpose
whatsoever.
the
one-year
carryover
provision
is
rationalized
by
the
appellants
with
only
one
reason.
they
claim
that
it
is
the
only
practical
means
to
determine
whether
a
tax
dependency
claim
will
be
taken
for
the
carryover
year,
but
in
fact
the
provision
does
not
operate
as
such.
by
the
end
of
the
carryover
year,
december
31,
the
income
tax
for
that
year
have
not
yet
been
filed,
they
will
be
filed
three
months
subsequently
so
that
even
at
the
end
of
the
carryover
year,
you
cannot
determine
whether
a
tax
dependency
claim
will
be
made
in
that
carryover
year.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
for
--
your
honor,
for
withholding
purposes,
that
does
not
require
you
to
take
a
dependency
claim,
quite
the
contrary
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
it
may
be
an
indication,
yes
your
honor.
but
certainly
if
you
felt
that
was
an
indication,
why
should
one
rigidly
deny
food
stamps
during
the
carryover
year
when
one
has
indicated
in
one’s
withholding
statement
that
you’re
not
making
a
tax
dependency
claim
during
the
carryover
year
and
yet
even
if
you
indicate
in
your
withholding
statement
that
you’re
not
going
to
take
a
tax
dependency
claim
during
the
carryover
year,
you
are
still
denied
food
stamps
during
that
carryover
year.
it
seems
to
me
operate
one
way
or
another,
either
you
indicate
that
that
withholding
statement
is
a
true
indication
of
a
dependency
claim
or
it
is
not.
if
it
is,
then
there
is
no
reason
to
deny
food
stamps
during
the
carryover
year
when
an
indication
has
clearly
been
made
that
you’re
not
going
to
make
a
dependency
claim
during
that
carryover
year.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
if
you
wish
to
strip
all
the
arbitrary
features
of
the
statute,
that
would
be
fine
because
then
there
wouldn’t
--
then
we
wouldn’t
have
a
harmful
statute.
however,
the
statute
is
clearly
irrational
for
a
numerous
reasons,
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
you
--
that
the
tax
dependency
claim
assumes
no
income
whatsoever.
it
doesn’t
assume
any
minimal
amount
at
all.
as
i’ve
indicated
before
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
the
parent
--
it
is
assumed
that
he
does
have
income.
it’s
also
assumed
that
the
person
has
some
income
because
he’s
not
illegible
for
food
stamps
since
his
income
may
be
slightly
above
the
income
eligibility
criteria
as
with
appellee
valdez.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
no.
i
think
the
inquiry
that
needs
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
what
i’m
trying
to
make
clear
i
think
is
that
this
statute
has
no
reasonable
relationship
to
any
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
there’s
only
one
legitimate
governmental
purpose
that
the
government
is
here
--
that
the
government
here
is
hypothesizing
and
that
is
that
it
eliminates
from
the
program
those
people
who
have
access
to
adequate
income.
what
i’m
indicating
your
honor
is
that
this
provision
does
not
have
this
reasonable
relationship
to
it.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
not
reasonably
related
and
this
provision
is
not
reasonably
related.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
yes,
except
to
close
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
one
class
of
individuals
here
is
a
group
of
people
living
in
a
household
where
no
one
has
been
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
the
other
one
is
where
there
is
someone
who
has
been
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent
where
that
dependent
is
over
18
years
of
age
and
the
one
group
is
disqualified
and
the
other
group
is
not
disqualified.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
it
would
have
to
be
purely
by
coincidence,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
by
coincidence
someone
did
have
adequate
income,
access
to
adequate
income
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
--
then
if
i
could
imagine
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
that
makes
it
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
i’m
not
saying
that
the
purpose
is
impermissible.
i’m
saying
the
purpose
is
fine.
i’m
just
saying
that
this
provision
is
not
reasonably
related
to
that
purpose.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
if
we
set
as
an
example
that
all
people
who
are
left-handed
should
be
denied
food
stamps
because
congress
for
some
reason
thought
that
left
handed
people
have
access
to
adequate
nutrition,
i
could
imagine
some
circumstances
where
household
containing
a
left-handed
person
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
your
honor,
even
under
your
hypothetical,
the
tax
dependent
is
still
needy
under
the
appellant’s
standards.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
seven
hundred
and
fifty
dollars.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
it
seem
to
me
that
since
the
entire
basis
of
this
provision
assumes
that
those
people
who
have
been
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
have
access
to
adequate
income
would
seem
to
me,
we
would
at
least
have
to
make
some
reasonable
search
to
determine
whether
in
fact
that’s
true
and
we
can
still
look
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
not
in
each
case,
but
i
think
its
so
clear
as
to
how
this
provision
operates.
the
provision
clearly
operates
even
if
no
support
is
provided,
even
if
one
dollar
is
provided,
and
you
just
take
a
look
at
the
appellees
themselves
and
i
think
you
can
show
that
there’s
a
very
substantial
likelihood
even
more
than
a
substantial
likelihood,
that
persons
who
would
have
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
have
no
access
to
nutritional
adequacy
while
those
people
who
have
not
been
taken
as
a
tax
dependent,
let's
say
children
of
a
millionaire
parent
are
still
allowed
to
participate
in
the
food
stamp
program.
in
short,
i
believe
that
this
provision
violates
equal
protection.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
concentrate
at
the
outset
the
appellant’s
noble
claim
and
that
is
a
question
that
there
is
no
standing
by
any
of
the
appellees
in
this
case.
appellees
would
just
like
to
seek
averted
decision
on
the
constitutionality
on
the
statute
because
they
say
that
the
statute
was
improperly
administered
rather
than
the
statute
itself
violates
equal
protection.
in
order
to
do
this,
they
raise
two
new
interpretations
of
the
statute,
interpretations
of
the
statute
that
differ
from
the
way
they
interpreted
the
statute
in
the
district
court.
in
fact,
interpretation
that
is
different
from
the
way
they
interpret
the
act
currently.
they
say
that
a
fraudulent
tax
claim
may
not
necessarily
disqualify
people
in
a
dependent
household.
well,
your
honors,
it’s
absolutely
clear
that
the
statute
itself
disqualifies
a
household
containing
a
dependent
even
if
that
dependent
was
claimed
fraudulently.
if
you
look
at
the
statute;
the
statute
says
very
clearly,
“any
household
which
includes
a
member
who
has
reached
his
18th
birthday
and
who
is
claimed
as
a
dependent
child
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
by
a
taxpayer
who
is
not
a
member
of
an
eligible
household
shall
be
ineligible
to
participate
in
any
food
stamp
program,
established
pursuant
to
this
chapter
during
the
tax
period
such
dependency
is
claimed
and
for
a
period
of
one
year
after
expiration
of
such
period.
appellants
admit
that
their
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
a
fraudulently
claimed
dependency
household
is
eliminated
from
the
food
stamp
program.
in
fact,
that’s
the
way
they
currently
administer
the
program.
if
this
case
were
reverse,
this
is
precisely
the
way
the
program
would
continue
to
operate.
appellants
forget
that
a
court
should
deference
to
administrating
agency's
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
this
is
precisely
the
way
that
the
department
of
agriculture
interprets
the
statute.
their
regulations
eliminate
fraudulently
claimed
dependent
households.
their
instructions
eliminate
fraudulently
claimed
dependent
households.
in
fact,
the
acting
administrator
of
the
food
&
nutrition
service,
mr.
howard
davis,
in
his
affidavit
and
you’ll
find
that
on
page
83
of
the
appendix,
he
says,
“there
are
no
factual
issues
to
be
presented
or
challenged
other
than
the
issue
of
whether
of
not
a
member
of
the
household
has
been
claimed
as
a
dependent
child.”
in
fact,
appellant’s
argument
in
the
district
court
was
that
it
is
illegal
to
check
into
the
tax
returns.
they
said
that
disclosure
to
the
dependent
or
to
the
food
stamp
office
as
to
whether
the
claim
was
proper
or
improper
is
impermissible
under
the
tax
statutes.
you’ll
find
that
statement
in
appendix
b
to
our
brief,
pages
22b
through
24b.
however,
even
if
this
court
wanted
to
fictionalize
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
change
the
way
this
agency,
the
department
of
agriculture
has
interpreted
this
provision
from
the
outset,
it
would
still
be
five
appellees
at
the
very
least
who
would
still
be
harmed
by
the
operation
of
the
statute.
appellees
alderete,
appellee
murry,
appellee
valdez,
appellee
broderson,
appellee
schultz.
appellee
murry
is
an
example
receives
only
$57.50
per
month,
that’s
the
only
income
she
has.
that
income
is
derived
from
her
ex-husband.
her
ex-husband
cannot
provide
any
additional
support
because
he
has
remarried.
he’s
got
two
children.
he’s
supporting
them
on
a
small
laborer's
wages.
she
receives
all
of
her
income
from
this
ex-husband
and
her
ex-husband
appropriately
has
claimed
her
as
a
tax
dependent.
consequently,
she
has
standing.
now,
the
appellants
have
said
that
the
food
stamp
benefits
she
gets,
that
those
food
stamp
benefits
should
be
included
in
the
determination
of
whether
the
household
receives
more
than
50%
of
its
income
from
the
claimant.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes,
however,
everyone
in
the
household
is
denied
food
stamps.
in
other
words,
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
person
over
18
years
of
age
in
mrs.
murry’s
household
who
is
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
there
is
a
young
child
by
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
18
years
of
age,
i
think
his
name
is
jordan
murry,
and
that
child
has
been
claimed
as
a
tax
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
right.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
right
but
everyone
in
the
household
is
denied
of
food
stamp.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
now,
appellee
--
appellant’s
misstate
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
the
statute
operates
only
because
one
of
the
children
was
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent,
not
because
one
of
the
grandchildren
was
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent.
the
appellants
would
have
us
believe
that
because
mrs.
murry
has
received
some
food
stamps,
that
those
food
stamp
benefits
should
be
included
in
determining
whether
the
taxpayer
who
made
the
claim
has
given
50%
to
the
income.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
the
statute
is
very
clear
on
this
issue.
look
at
section
2016
(c)
of
title
7.
it
says,
“the
value
of
the
coupon
allotment
provided
to
any
eligible
household
which
is
in
excess
of
the
amount
charged
such
households
for
such
allotment
shall
not
be
considered
to
be
income
or
resources
for
any
purpose
under
federal
or
state
laws
including
but
not
limited
to
laws
relating
to
taxation,
welfare
and
public
assistance
programs.”
the
only
provision
that
the
appellant
cite
to
the
contrary
is
a
tax
ruling
which
they
cite
at
page
3,
note
1.
that
ruling
however
has
absolutely
no
application
to
that
case
--
to
this
case.
that
ruling
merely
refers
to
“state
benefit
payments
measured
solely
by
a
recipient’s
needs.”
these
are
not
state
welfare
benefits.
these
are
federal
benefits.
all
of
the
benefits
are
subsidized
by
the
federal
government.
at
the
very
least
your
honors
there
are
five
appellees
who
are
not
harmed
because
of
the
wrongful
administration
of
the
statute.
they
are
harmed
because
of
the
statute
itself.
appellants'
other
new
statutory
interpretation
is
that
they
say
for
the
provision
to
operate,
you
do
not
have
to
have
been
outside
the
taxpayer
claimants
house
during
part
of
the
tax
year.
they
say
if
you
are
outside
of
the
household,
during
the
carryover
year,
the
year
after
the
period
for
which
the
tax
dependency
was
claimed,
but
you
were
not
outside
of
the
household
during
the
period
for
the
tax
dependency
claim,
then
you
should
not
have
been
denied
food
stamps.
however,
even
if
this
new
statutory
interpretation
was
accepted
by
the
court,
every
single
one
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
would
still
be
operate
--
would
still
be
harmed
by
the
operation
of
the
statute.
it
is
clear
that
this
case
is
not
moot,
it’s
a
very
live
controversy.
turning
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
it’s
clear
that
this
provision
was
designed
to
eliminate
non-needy
households
from
the
food
stamp
program.
however,
the
tax
dependency
provision
is
not
reasonably
related
to
that
purpose
at
all.
as
district
judge
hart
said,
he
said
that,
“eliminating
the
voluntary
poor
from
the
program
or
those
people
who
have
access
to
a
nutritional
adequacy,
that
operation
really
required
the
utilization
of
a
surgeon
scalpel.”
and
what
was
done
with
the
statute
was
congress
wound
up
using
a
meat
cleaver
and
started
eliminating
the
needy
people
from
the
program,
not
the
un-needy
from
the
program.
the
statute
completely
missed
in
its
statutory
objective.
the
tax
dependency
provision
is
wholly
unrelated
to
an
assessment
of
a
household’s
current
needs.
although
the
entire
food
stamp
program
operates
on
the
basis
of
current
circumstances,
the
provision
is
not
at
all
related
to
what
one's
current
circumstances
actually
are,
but
the
program
works
on
the
basis
of
current
circumstances.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
you’ll
find
that
your
honor
on
page
50
of
my
brief.
it’s
in
the
footnote
and
in
the
text.
there
are
two
different
statements
that
he
made.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
that
is
not
part
of
the
opinion.
that
was
part
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
district
court
and
i
have
provided
in
appendix
b
the
transcript
of
that
oral
argument
and
i
quoted
there
from.
this
program
operates
on
the
basis
of
current
need
is
clear.
certification
periods
are
very
short.
certification
periods
are
essentially
three
months
under
the
program
and
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
an
assessment
of
what
the
current
circumstances
of
a
household
are.
if
you
were
illegible
on
the
basis
of
current
income
or
if
you
were
--
if
you
have
current
resources
that
make
you
needy
then
you
are
illegible
for
the
food
stamp
program.
similarly,
even
if
you
refused
to
qualify
under
the
work
requirement
previously
if
you
are
now
willing
to
comply
with
the
work
requirement
you
are
ineligible
for
food
stamps.
clearly,
the
program
operates
on
the
basis
of
current
circumstances.
well,
this
provision
is
not
at
all
related
to
an
assessment
of
an
individual’s
current
need.
in
fact,
contrary
to
what
the
appellants
have
indicated,
this
provision
operates
on
the
basis
of
a
tax
dependency
claim
that
is
made
in
april
or
march
of
the
tax
year.
in
fact,
they
so
indicated
you’ll
find
that
in
the
appendix
at
page
81,
when
they
gave
an
example
of
how
the
provision
operates
and
you’ll
also
see
that’s
the
way
they
claim
the
way
provision
operates
and
that’s
in
our
appendix
to
the
brief,
appendix
17b.
what
happens
is,
you
are
denied
food
stamps
on
the
basis
of
a
tax
dependency
claim
that
is
made
in
april
or
march
subsequent
to
the
period
of
the
tax
year
for
which
you
are
making
the
claim.
consequently,
when
the
claim
is
made
the
tax
year
is
already
over.
the
period
is
an
entire
nullity
with
regard
to
the
tax
year
for
which
the
dependency
claim
was
made.
you
have
received
food
stamps
during
that
year.
in
other
words,
the
provision
only
operates
during
the
subsequent
year,
the
so-called
carryover
year
and
the
provision
rigidly
denies
you
food
stamps
during
the
year
after
the
period
for
which
the
dependency
claim
was
made.
in
fact,
all
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
were
denied
assistance
during
the
carryover
year,
not
the
year
for
which
the
dependency
claim
was
made
but
during
the
carryover
year.
in
fact,
every
one
is
essentially
affected
exclusively
during
the
carryover
year
and
the
tax
dependency
claim
has
absolutely
no
relationship
to
what
is
occurring
in
that
carryover
year.
at
best,
it
has
some
relationship
to
what
happened
during
the
preceding
year
for
which
that
the
tax
dependency
claim
was
made.
but
your
honors,
i
think
what
is
even
more
important
is
that
a
tax
dependency
claim
has
absolutely
no
correlation
to
a
household’s
actual
availability
of
income
and
that’s
because
under
the
tax
dependency
provision,
there
is
no
minimum
support
that
need
be
provided.
you
only
need
to
provide
over
50%
of
your
income.
in
other
words,
if
a
household
has
absolutely
no
income
at
all
and
the
taxpayer
gave
one
dollar
to
that
household
then
the
taxpayer
has
a
right
to
make
a
tax
dependency
claim
for
that
year.
despite
the
fact
that
that
household
has
only
one
dollar
of
income
for
that
entire
year,
they
are
denied
food
stamps
because
they
were
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
and
in
fact
properly
so
because
they
gave
over
50%
of
the
income
if
that
household
has
absolutely
no
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
for
non-students,
this
provision
is
entirely
arbitrary.
in
order
to
be
declared
a
tax
dependent,
a
non-student
must
have
income
under
$750.00.
if
a
non-student
has
income
over
$750,
you
cannot
claim
them
as
a
tax
dependent.
consequently,
if
you
were
--
if
you
gave
more
than
$750.00,
you
can
declare
a
non-student
as
a
tax
dependent
and
you
can
see
if
you
accumulate
that
--
the
student’s
income
or
the
non-students’
income
and
the
amount
provided
by
the
taxpayer,
it
still
provides
you
far
short
of
the
standards
of
need
that
are
established
by
the
appellants
on
this
case.
take
as
an
example,
the
six-person
eligibility
standard
under
the
food
stamp
program.
for
a
six-person
household
to
be
eligible
for
food
stamps,
you
must
have
an
annual
income
of
under
$6,084.00.
clearly,
a
non-student
is
a
very
substantial
likelihood.
in
fact,
there’s
a
probably
--
there's
a
probability
that
a
non-student
who
was
claimed
as
a
dependent
is
still
needy
under
the
appellant’s
own
standards.
nevertheless
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
between
the
ages
of
18
and
19,
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
if
you
are
over
19
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
if
you’re
18
or
19,
what
i
said
does
not
apply.
once
you
are
over
19,
it
does.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
now,
you
can
never
demonstrate
throughout
the
entire
administrative
process
that
you
have
absolutely
no
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
take
appellee
lula
mae
murry
as
an
example.
her
5%
household
receives
as
a
total
$57.50
per
month
in
income
of
which
$25.00
is
paid
directly
for
rent
and
then
she
pays
$18.50
for
her
utility
bill.
for
all
of
her
other
expenses,
that
includes
clothing,
medical
expenses,
school
supplies,
transportation,
household
supplies,
hygienic
items,
she
has
merely
nine
cents
a
person
per
day.
obviously,
she
cannot
purchase
a
nutritionally
adequate
diet.
she
cannot
live
without
receiving
some
kind
of
assistance.
she
needs
the
food
stamp
program.
indeed,
she
had
been
receiving
food
stamps
before.
she
had
been
receiving
$128.00
in
benefits
and
she
was
paying
for
that
only
$11.00.
that
was
what
permitted
her
to
survive.
but
because
of
the
fact
that
her
ex-husband
has
claimed
one
of
their
children
as
a
tax
dependent
every
one
in
the
household
is
denied
of
food
stamps.
it
is
presumed
in
essence
that
that
family
has
access
to
adequate
income
to
purchase
a
nutritionally
adequate
diet.
take
as
an
example
appellee
schultz.
appellee
schultz
has
absolutely
no
income
whatsoever.
she
doesn’t
have
a
single
penny
in
income.
in
fact,
she
has
been
in
a
hospital
for
four
months
suffering
from
malnutrition
because
all
she
was
leaving
on
was
wild
sweet
potatoes
and
water.
and
she’s
been
in
the
hospital
very
sick
because
she
did
not
have
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
nevertheless,
because
she
was
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
in
the
previous
year
and
despite
the
fact
that
she
receives
no
assistance
during
the
current
year
she
is
denied
food
stamps
during
this
current
year,
the
so-called
carryover
year.
your
honor,
the
one-year
carryover
period
is
also
extremely
rigid.
even
if
one
can
convincingly
demonstrate
that
the
taxpayer
cannot
provide
any
support
whatsoever
during
this
carryover
year
but
is
still
denied
food
stamps
by
virtue
of
the
tax
dependency
claim
of
the
previous
year.
even
if
one
can
convincingly
demonstrate
that
one
is
not
going
to
be
taking
a
tax
dependency
claim
for
this
year,
one
is
denied
food
stamps
during
the
carryover
year.
in
fact,
even
if
once
swore,
the
taxpayer
swore
that
a
dependency
claim
is
not
going
to
be
made
in
the
carryover
year,
people
are
denied
food
stamps
during
that
carryover
year.
it’s
a
very
rigid
provision
if
you
are
denied
food
stamps
during
that
carryover
year.
take
as
an
example
appellee
joe
ben
valdez.
his
father
took
him
as
a
tax
dependent
in
the
previous
year,
so
5%
of
the
household
that
his
father
is
a
head
of,
a
$450.00
of
income
of
which
they
have
$497.00
of
expenses
because
they
have
very
substantial
debts.
mr.
valdez
has
diabetes
and
an
ulcerous
condition
and
he
cannot
provide
any
support
for
the
tax
dependent’s
household.
nevertheless,
appellee’s
household
was
denied
food
stamps
even
though
they
can
convincingly
demonstrate
that
no
--
the
tax
dependency
claim
will
be
made
this
year.
even
though
they
can
convincingly
demonstrate
that
no
support
at
all
is
being
provided
this
year,
they
are
denied
food
stamps.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
there
is
no
remedy
whatsoever.
and
what
makes
that
even
clearer
your
honor,
if
you
take
a
look
at
our
appendix
a
you’ll
note
that
a
child
over
18
years
of
age
by
and
large
cannot
receive
--
cannot
legally
compel
support
from
a
taxpayer.
the
reason
is
that
in
the
majority
of
the
states
your
legal
liability
to
support
your
child
ends
at
18
years
of
age
so
that
in
the
situation
that
you
raise
mr.
justice
marshall,
even
let’s
say
there
was
a
fraudulent
tax
claim,
the
father
is
in
jail,
it’s
clear
that
he
made
a
fraudulent
tax
claim.
it’s
clear
that
the
household
is
denied
of
food
stamps
solely
because
of
his
fault.
there’s
just
nothing
that
can
be
done
to
help
the
tax
dependent’s
household.
they
are
rigidly
and
i
would
say
arbitrarily
denied
food
stamps.
they
have
no
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
the
father
can’t
support
them
in
jail.
he
never
had
any
intention
to
support
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
excuse
me.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
what
i
am
saying
however
is
that’s
not
reasonably
related
to
any
purpose.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
you
wanted
to
create
a
pure
fiction,
i
suppose
you
could.
however
the
administrative
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
mean
your
honor,
what
in
essence
you’re
doing
is
you’re
saying
the
provision
is
so
irrational
that
therefore
we’re
going
to
try
and
legislate
it
and
make
it
rationale.
well,
the
whole
equal
protection
argument
that
we’re
making
is
that
the
provision
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
don’t
know
of
an
instance,
your
honor
where
both
parties
agree
on
what
the
statute
says
and
the
court
wound
up
coming
up
with
a
new
interpretation
of
the
statute
just
to
save
the
statute.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
okay.
your
honor
even
if
you
read
into
the
provision
that
a
fraudulent
tax
claim
does
not
deny
food
stamps.
but
that
is
an
improper
administration
of
the
statute,
i
would
still
say
that
the
statute
is
arbitrary.
there’s
no
implication
whatsoever
that
because
the
tax
dependency
claim
was
made
that
the
tax
dependent’s
household
has
access
to
nutritional
adequacy.
as
i
indicated
before,
if
a
household
has
no
income
at
all,
take
christie
schultz
as
an
example.
she
has
no
income
whatsoever.
if
her
parents
gave
her
merely
one
dollar,
then
they
could
probably
claim
christie
as
a
tax
dependent
and
as
a
result
of
merely
one
dollar
per
year
she
would
be
denied
food
stamps.
even
if
she
can
show
during
the
carryover
year
that
she’s
not
going
to
be
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent
she
is
going
to
be
denied
of
food
stamps.
your
honors,
it
seems
me
that
this
carryover
provision,
this
one
year
carryover
even
when
one
can
show
that
one
will
not
be
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
during
that
carryover
year
is
essentially
the
same
kind
of
blunderbuss
one
year
in
eligibility
system
that
was
scored
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
in
shapiro
v.
thompson,
you
also
indicated
that
that
provision,
the
one
year
durational
residence
requirement
would’ve
been
invalid
even
under
the
traditional
equal
protection
standard.
under
the
traditional
equal
protection
standard,
i
would
submit
that
this
case
is
stronger
than
the
one
in
shapiro
for
the
reason
that
in
shapiro
the
one
year
ineligibility
at
least
served
a
purpose.
it
served
the
purpose
of
deterring
fraud.
here,
the
one-year
carryover
provision
serves
no
purpose
whatsoever.
the
one-year
carryover
provision
is
rationalized
by
the
appellants
with
only
one
reason.
they
claim
that
it
is
the
only
practical
means
to
determine
whether
a
tax
dependency
claim
will
be
taken
for
the
carryover
year,
but
in
fact
the
provision
does
not
operate
as
such.
by
the
end
of
the
carryover
year,
december
31,
the
income
tax
for
that
year
have
not
yet
been
filed,
they
will
be
filed
three
months
subsequently
so
that
even
at
the
end
of
the
carryover
year,
you
cannot
determine
whether
a
tax
dependency
claim
will
be
made
in
that
carryover
year.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
for
--
your
honor,
for
withholding
purposes,
that
does
not
require
you
to
take
a
dependency
claim,
quite
the
contrary
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
it
may
be
an
indication,
yes
your
honor.
but
certainly
if
you
felt
that
was
an
indication,
why
should
one
rigidly
deny
food
stamps
during
the
carryover
year
when
one
has
indicated
in
one’s
withholding
statement
that
you’re
not
making
a
tax
dependency
claim
during
the
carryover
year
and
yet
even
if
you
indicate
in
your
withholding
statement
that
you’re
not
going
to
take
a
tax
dependency
claim
during
the
carryover
year,
you
are
still
denied
food
stamps
during
that
carryover
year.
it
seems
to
me
operate
one
way
or
another,
either
you
indicate
that
that
withholding
statement
is
a
true
indication
of
a
dependency
claim
or
it
is
not.
if
it
is,
then
there
is
no
reason
to
deny
food
stamps
during
the
carryover
year
when
an
indication
has
clearly
been
made
that
you’re
not
going
to
make
a
dependency
claim
during
that
carryover
year.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
if
you
wish
to
strip
all
the
arbitrary
features
of
the
statute,
that
would
be
fine
because
then
there
wouldn’t
--
then
we
wouldn’t
have
a
harmful
statute.
however,
the
statute
is
clearly
irrational
for
a
numerous
reasons,
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
you
--
that
the
tax
dependency
claim
assumes
no
income
whatsoever.
it
doesn’t
assume
any
minimal
amount
at
all.
as
i’ve
indicated
before
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
the
parent
--
it
is
assumed
that
he
does
have
income.
it’s
also
assumed
that
the
person
has
some
income
because
he’s
not
illegible
for
food
stamps
since
his
income
may
be
slightly
above
the
income
eligibility
criteria
as
with
appellee
valdez.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
no.
i
think
the
inquiry
that
needs
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
what
i’m
trying
to
make
clear
i
think
is
that
this
statute
has
no
reasonable
relationship
to
any
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
there’s
only
one
legitimate
governmental
purpose
that
the
government
is
here
--
that
the
government
here
is
hypothesizing
and
that
is
that
it
eliminates
from
the
program
those
people
who
have
access
to
adequate
income.
what
i’m
indicating
your
honor
is
that
this
provision
does
not
have
this
reasonable
relationship
to
it.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
not
reasonably
related
and
this
provision
is
not
reasonably
related.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
yes,
except
to
close
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
one
class
of
individuals
here
is
a
group
of
people
living
in
a
household
where
no
one
has
been
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
the
other
one
is
where
there
is
someone
who
has
been
claimed
as
a
tax
dependent
where
that
dependent
is
over
18
years
of
age
and
the
one
group
is
disqualified
and
the
other
group
is
not
disqualified.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
it
would
have
to
be
purely
by
coincidence,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
by
coincidence
someone
did
have
adequate
income,
access
to
adequate
income
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
--
then
if
i
could
imagine
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
that
makes
it
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
i’m
not
saying
that
the
purpose
is
impermissible.
i’m
saying
the
purpose
is
fine.
i’m
just
saying
that
this
provision
is
not
reasonably
related
to
that
purpose.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
if
we
set
as
an
example
that
all
people
who
are
left-handed
should
be
denied
food
stamps
because
congress
for
some
reason
thought
that
left
handed
people
have
access
to
adequate
nutrition,
i
could
imagine
some
circumstances
where
household
containing
a
left-handed
person
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
your
honor,
even
under
your
hypothetical,
the
tax
dependent
is
still
needy
under
the
appellant’s
standards.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
seven
hundred
and
fifty
dollars.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
it
seem
to
me
that
since
the
entire
basis
of
this
provision
assumes
that
those
people
who
have
been
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
have
access
to
adequate
income
would
seem
to
me,
we
would
at
least
have
to
make
some
reasonable
search
to
determine
whether
in
fact
that’s
true
and
we
can
still
look
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
not
in
each
case,
but
i
think
its
so
clear
as
to
how
this
provision
operates.
the
provision
clearly
operates
even
if
no
support
is
provided,
even
if
one
dollar
is
provided,
and
you
just
take
a
look
at
the
appellees
themselves
and
i
think
you
can
show
that
there’s
a
very
substantial
likelihood
even
more
than
a
substantial
likelihood,
that
persons
who
would
have
taken
as
a
tax
dependent
have
no
access
to
nutritional
adequacy
while
those
people
who
have
not
been
taken
as
a
tax
dependent,
let's
say
children
of
a
millionaire
parent
are
still
allowed
to
participate
in
the
food
stamp
program.
in
short,
i
believe
that
this
provision
violates
equal
protection.
