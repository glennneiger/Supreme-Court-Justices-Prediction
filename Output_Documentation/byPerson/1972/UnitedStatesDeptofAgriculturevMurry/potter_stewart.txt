justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
--
as
a
practical
matter
how
does
it
--
again
would
this
work?
does
every
member
of
an
applicant
household
have
to
fill
out
a
form
and
swear
to
it
that
he
has
not
been
claimed
as
a
dependent
by
a
parent?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
by
--
you
don’t
mean
now
claiming,
this
is
something
that’s
done
once
a
year
--
by
my
most
people
on
april
--
on
or
before
april
15.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
well
that’s
when
you
make
the
claim
too,
that’s
when
you
get
the
exemption?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that’s
not
the
statute
talks
about?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
--?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
only
if
--?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
he
might
--
if
he
says
no,
is
that
accepted?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
says
yes,
of
course
that’s
accepted
by
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
that
makes
the
man
eligible?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
says
i
don’t
know
my
father
and
i
haven’t
been
on
speaking
in
terms
for
the
last
three
years
then
and
only
then
are
on
this
sub-circumstances
you
--
the
agency
communicates
with
the
parent,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
may
just
interrupt
you
and
excuse
me.
i
thought
that
the
statutes
only
had
to
do
with
dependents
who
were
children,
not
ex-spouses.
it
says
that
the
claim
as
dependent
by
a
parent
or
guardian,
an
ex-spouse
is
certainly
not
a
parent
and
i
should
suppose
not
a
guardian
either?
justice
potter
stewart
now
who
is
that
person?
justice
potter
stewart
a
child?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it’s
not
the
--
not
--
it's
not
the
mother
you're
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
the
mother
gets
the
income
from
the
husband.
justice
potter
stewart
from
her
ex-husband.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
child
is
claimed?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
potter
stewart
somebody
under
19
can
be
a
dependent,
a
child
under
19
can
be
dependent
even
though
he
has
an

not
more

$750.00?
justice
potter
stewart
the
internal
revenue
code
makes
the
very
--
the
next
--
19
a
critical
age.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
law
makes
18
the
critical
age?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
between
18
and
19,
which
are
you
telling
us
is
not
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
generally
a
person
wouldn’t
claim
a

unless
he
hadn't--
unless
he
had
to
file
an

and
he
would
not
file
an

return
if
he
didn’t
have
income,
won’t
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
does
assume
pre-supposed
income
on
the
part
of
the
parent
or
guardian?
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
misunderstood
you,
