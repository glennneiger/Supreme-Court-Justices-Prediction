chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
jones.
mr.
pollack.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
construe
the
statute?
could
the
statute
be
construed
by
that
of
the
court
to
take
out
that
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
the
statutes
never
been
saved
by
that
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
my
question
was,
have
statutes
never
been
saved
by
that
precise
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
look
at
--
take
a
look
at
tilton
against
richardson
sometime
when
you
have
a
free
moment,
decided
last
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
can
in
some
cases,
can’t
you
mr.
pollack
where
a
statement
has
been
filed
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
for
the
deduction
purposes
--
for
the
withholding
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn’t
require
it,
but
permits
it,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
statute
be
saved
there
again
by
invalidating
if
that
provision
on
the
carryover
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
congress
hadn’t
--
had
a
report
here,
in
which
they
said
their
studies
and
searches
indicated
that
a
very
large
number
of
people
for
whom
a
deduction
was
taken
actually
received
an
average
of
$1,000.00
a
year
support
from
the
person
taking
the
deduction
for
them.
would
the
statute
then
serve
a
valid
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
does
it
serve
a
valid
purpose
if
that’s
the
finding
of
congress
that
if,
what
is
the
deduction
now,
$750.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
for
every
$750.00,
their
studies
showed
in
some
way
that
1,000
was
actually
given
by
way
of
support
by
the
person
claiming
the
deduction
and
representing
more
than
half
of
the
income?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
each
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.

do
you
have
anything
further?
