do
you
know
something
about
how
a
map
like
that
was
prepared
and
who
actually
made
a
decision
as
to
where
this
line
should
go?
you
know
there
may
have
been
a
survey
hired
a
couple
of
years
ago
that
wasn't
vested
with
any
decisional
authority
on
the
part

you
don't
treat
it
as
an
admission
against

on
their

(inaudible)
that
shipping
that
comes
into
port
aurthur
and
beaumont,
i
take
it
uses
the
port
aurthur
canal
rather
than
coming
into
sabine

is
that
right?

mr.
stockwell,
as
i
understand
the
common
law
anyway
if
you
were
to
occupy
a
property
which
i
claim
and
possess
it,
a
mere
letter
from
me
to
you
saying
i
claim
it
is
mine
which
did
not
change
your
possession
would
not
stop
the
prescriptive
period
for
money.
i
would
have
to
commence
a
lawsuit
to
evict
you
from
the
property
rather
than
simply
send
you
a
letter.
wouldn’t
you
agree
at
least
generally
that
that
same
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
i
would
agree
with
that
but
so
far
as
governor
jones'
letter
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
texas
was
exercising
possession
prior
to
that
and
continue
to
exercise
it
afterwards,
i
do
not
see
that
the
letter
would
be
terribly
relevant?
