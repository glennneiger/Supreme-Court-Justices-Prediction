(inaudible)
you
have
no
rebuttal
is
that
you
are
the
equivalent
of
the
not
of
the
appellant
of
the
petitioner
here,
but
basically
of
the
respondent,
aren't
you.
you
were
the
plaintiff
below,
your
master
did
what
you
wanted
him
to
do
with
one
minor
exception.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
this
case
is
reverse
from
its
ordinary
posture,
the
ordinary
posture
of
an
appellate
case
before
our
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
who
had
title
as
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
louisiana,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
other
possibilities?
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
either
one
of
them
will
be
on
either
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
a
river
that
shifts
the
way
that
mississippi
river
has
or
used
to?
justice
potter
stewart
would
there
be
any
difficulty
in
--
i
am
thinking
about
contrasting
the
the
thgalweg
with
the
geographical
center
at
the
river
which
should
be
the
easiest
advice
of
practical
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
it
is
at
least
arguable
that
it
is
almost
equal
depths
through
most
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
any,
does
this
controversy
have
to
do
with
the
boundary
between
louisiana
and
texas
seaward
of
the
coast
up
to
the
three
leagues
for
texas
and
three
miles
for
louisiana?
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
has
something
to
do
with
the
starting
point,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it's
the
middle
of
the
mouth
of
the
west
bank.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
between
you
--
as
between
texas
and
louisiana,
that
boundary
that's
seaward
of
the
shoreline
is
affected
by
this
controversy?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
