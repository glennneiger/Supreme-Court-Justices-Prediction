mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
it
is
very
important
from
louisiana's
standpoint
to
have
the
court
appreciate
the
early
history
of
this
particular
area
as
mr.
mcdaniel
has
mentioned
when
louisiana
was
purchased
from
france
in
1803
there
was
a
dispute
over
what
its
western
boundary
was
going
to
be.
so,
in
1804
they
created
the
territory
of
orleans
which
extended
to
the
33rd
degree
north
latitude
which
is
the
north
boundary
of
louisiana.
so,
in
1806
and
i
think
this
is
very
important,
neither
of
the
special
masters
of
texas
have
really
covered
this
issue,
in
1806,
the
united
states
and
spain,
entered
into
an
agreement
creating
what
was
known
as
a
neutral
zone.
now,
this
neutral
zone
extended
from
the
mermentau
river
up
to
the
red
river.
now
the
red
river
is
part
of
the
mississippi
watershed.
the
big
issue
was
louisiana
was
only
to
cover
the
louisiana
watershed
and
the
louisiana
watershed
fell
somewhere
between
lake
chapala
and
the
mermentau.
so,
spain
had
brought
troops
into
this
area
and
the
united
states
had
brought
troops
in
there
and
they
were
getting
ready
to
have
a
confrontation.
so
they
entered
into
this
agreement
in
1806
and
provided
that
neither
the
united
states
nor
spain
would
occupy
this
area.
they
would
assert
no
jurisdiction
over
it
and
it
really
became
a
no
man’s
land.
and
when
louisiana
was
admitted
as
a
state
in
1812
it
was
admitted
subject
to
this
outstanding
agreement.
louisiana
could
not
take
possession
of
this
area
of
land.
they
could
not
go
in
there
and
could
force
any
laws
at
all.
and
of
course
this
wasn't
settled
until
the
trivia
of
1890.
in
other
words
spain
and
the
united
states
negotiated
a
treaty
and
settled
the
western
boundary
of
the
louisiana
purchase
and
also
the
florida
parish.
of
course
the
boundary
one
could
find
this
to
louisiana,
it
went
on
up
to
the
red
river
and
out
to
the
pacific.
but
when
they
settled
that
boundary
they
settled
it
on
the
west
bank
of
the
sabine
up
to
the
32nd
degree
north
latitude
and
then
north
to
the
33rd
which
is
the
north
west
corner
of
louisiana.
so,
no
patent
were
issued
at
this
area
by
the
united
states.
when
louisiana
was
admitted
as
a
state
the
federal
government
retained
all
un-appropriated
lands.
now
texas
when
it
was
admitted
as
a
state
retained
these
lands.
so,
all
of
the
titles
to
louisiana
lands
emanate
from
the
federal
government
except
now
in
the
streams.
so
during
this
period
there
were
no
titles
issued
in
here
at
all.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
yes,
in
my
brief—
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
it's
liberty
of
putting
a
chapter
out
of
this
book
of
maroo
(ph)
who
was
a
freebooter
in
this
particular
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
live
in
lake
charles
which
is
in
this
particular
area.
it
is
about
70
miles
from
the
sabine
across
to
the
mermentau.
so,
you
can
see
that
it
was
quite
a
question
when
louisiana
was
admitted
into
the
union
up
till
they
settled
this
dispute
in
1890
and
finally
they
did
not
issue
patents
till
about
1824.
they
started
issuing
some
patents
and
even
when
they
surveyed
this
line
in
1840-41,
mr.
overton
who
was
representing
the
united
states
pointed
out
the
law
in
this
area.
and
so
even
when
texas
was
admitted
as
a
state
in
1845
they
still
had
this
problem.
now
texas
did
have
a
settlements
along
the
sabine
on
the
west
bank
but
louisiana
have
no
settlements.
all
this
was
marsh
land
and
it
is
marsh
to
date
and
way
up
to
river
its
marsh.
the
only
settlement
was
along
the
western
bank
and
i
think
that's
important
because
as
the
court
will
note
in
my
appendix
i
mentioned
a
letter
from
secretary
of
state
of
the
republic
of
texas
to
the
representative
of
united
states
concerning
an
interpretation
of
the
word
use
in
the
treaty
of
1890.
now,
both
the
special
master
and
texas
have
avoided
a
discussion
of
this
particular
phrase
which
i
think
is
the
main
issue
in
the
case.
now
the
representative
of
the
republic
of
texas
said
the
word
use
meant
to
the
jurisdiction
over
this
water.
you
see
in
the
treaty
both
the
inhabitants
of
texas
and
the
inhabitants
of
louisiana
had
equal
use
and
navigation
of
the
water
which
gave
them
a
use
throughout
the
whole
river
and
this
use
would
not
limit
it
to
navigation,
that
was
something
separate
and
texas
in
this
letter
which
is
in
the
appendix
defines
what
they
consider
this
used
to
be.
they
had
ports
here
and
ships
were
coming
in
and
smuggling
and
they
wanted
to
have
the
right
to
go
out
and
exercise
jurisdiction
to
stop
the
smuggling
which
they
said
they
had
a
right
to
do.
now
this
discussion
was
going
on,
this
was
just
prior
to
1845
when
texas
was
admitted.
so
it
wasn’t
unusual
for
louisiana
in
1848
to
say
that
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
full
jurisdiction
over
the
sabine
even
though
they
own
--
their
boundary
was
on
the
west
bank
because
the
constitution
said
commencing
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
bends
along
the
middle
to
the
33rd
degree
north
latitude
and
in
north
to
the
33rd.
so,
in
this
resolution
as
it
is
read
by
mr.
mcdaniel
accurately,
they
said
that
they
were
talking
about
extending
jurisdiction.
here
were
both
louisiana
and
texas
that
had
equal
jurisdiction
over
this
body
of
water
by
virtue
of
the
use
and
so
it
was
a
question
of
either
louisiana
having
a
full
jurisdiction
or
like
congress
decided
to
do,
they
gave
half
of
the
jurisdiction
to
texas
so
that
they
could
enforce
the
criminal
laws.
now
even
texas,
i
think
it
is
really
important
because
texas
talks
about
the
fact
that
louisiana
being
able
to
acquire
this
territory
without
a
specific
act
of
congress.
in
one
of
texas
briefs,
it
is
a
brief,
plaintiffs
reply
brief
before
the
special
master
on
page
six,
they
admit
that
--
in
other
words,
they
say
louisiana
obtained
title
to
the
unsold
federal
land
adjacent
to
the
texas-houston
land
boundary
line
by
grants
from
the
united
states
government
under
the
swamp
and
overflow
lands
act
after
its
jurisdiction
over
the
area
had
been
recognized
and
acquiesced
in
by
the
united
states
government’s
resurvey
of
such
land
as
a
waste
land
in
1846.
now
what
happened
was
that
before
texas
was
admitted
into
the
union
and
before
they
made
this
joint
survey,
the
united
states
had
gone
in
and
surveyed
a
lot
of
this
land
and
they
had
surveyed
as
part
of
the
land
that
they
considered
louisiana
that
extended
west
of
this
line.
so
when
they
made
this
survey
in
1841,
they
had
to
readjust
these
townships
and
some
of
the
people
that
had
purchased
land
from
the
united
states
government
in
louisiana
received
a
indemnity
for
it
and
so
they
--
that
meant
that
louisiana
had
to
give
up
some
land
out
of
this
area
and
the
lines
were
readjusted
as
texas
admits
in
1846
to
conform
to
this
boundary
agreement
in
1890.
now,
texas,
in
bringing
this
suit,
they
limited
it
to
this
water
boundary,
but
louisiana
feel
that
they
only
way
the
court
can
appreciate
this
boundary
dispute
is
that
it
must
consider
the
total
boundary
of
louisiana.
texas
knew
that
louisiana’s
boundaries
from
the
33rd
to
32nd
degree
north
latitude
would
have
to
be
recognized
as
the
treaty
boundary.
now
they
are
saying
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
the
treaty
boundary
from
the
32nd
degree
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
virtue
of
the
language
in
the
constitution
of
1812
of
louisiana
which
is
the
same
constitution
which
covered
the
northern
boundary
in
which
they
admit
we
are
entitled
to.
so
we
say
that
when
the
court
considered
this
case
in
the
light
of
the
historical
facts
that
this
act,
if
they
would
allow
this
resolution,
show
that
louisiana
considered
that
this
was
their
west
boundary.
they
are
only
asking
to
give
them
the
jurisdiction
and
the
congress
gave
the
jurisdiction
to
texas.
now,
if
it
is
intended
by
this
act
that
they
transfer
this
title
to
texas,
then
under
this
court’s
case
of
mississippi
versus
louisiana,
congress
could
not
deprive
louisiana
of
title
to
its
land.
so,
we
say
that
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
find
all
of
these
maps
and
things
with
this
line
now.
in
other
words,
there
have
been
no
question
about
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
fishing,
hunting
and
various
other
activities
on
these
navigable
bodies
of
water
because
the
citizens
of
both
states
had
equal
rights
unless
you
considered
that
the
jurisdiction
was
going
to
be
exercised
in
limited
areas
by
either
one
of
them.
now,
this
particular
body
of
water
here
is
not
--
as
a
recent
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
brought
about
by
compact
between
texas
and
louisiana
in
1954,
creating
the
toledo
bend
dam.
in
this
compact,
it
was
specifically
stated
that
this
would
not
attempt
to
settle
a
boundary.
in
other
words,
texas
knows
that
there
has
been
a
real
dispute
over
this
boundary
for
many
years
and
they
have
not
been
misled.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
governor
jones
in
1941
wrote
a
letter
to
the
governor
of
texas
stating
that
louisiana
owned
to
the
west
bank
of
the
sabine
under
the
treaty
of
1890.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
gouge,
who
was
then
land
commission
of
texas,
he
claimed
that
texas
owned
150
foot
strip
from
this
point
on
the
sabine,
32nd
to
the
33rd.
in
other
words,
at
that
time,
they
were
trying
to
claim
that
they
owned
over
to
louisiana’s
boundary
under
what
they
said
the
wording
of
the
constitution.
now
they
admit
that
louisiana
owns
it.
so
it
all
goes
to
show
that
texas
really
has
never
had
any
claim,
had
any
doubt
that
louisiana
has
its
plan.
now
they
thought
that
they
would
bring
in
a
picture
like
this
that
shows
the,
all
this
field
here.
well
actually
all
this
field
was
done
by
the
corps
of
engineers
in
digging
these
channels
and
this
was
not
done
by
texas.
the
fact
that
texas
has
used
some
of
them
and
of
course
the
united
states
has
a
navigational
easement
over
this
whole
body
of
water.
so
we
say
that
louisiana
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it—
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
the
put
all
the
people
who
built
it
on
this
field,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
no,
no
i
am
not
trying
to
see
it.
i
was
trying
to
say
the
field
was
built
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
now
they
have
built
on
that
but
most
of
that
was
built
after
1941
when
they
were
put
on
orders
by
governor
jones
that
louisiana
claimed
of
the
west
bank.
so
we
--
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
i
was
saying
that
--
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
yes
it
answers
justice
marshall.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
he
asked
me
who
built
on
this
--
the
pleasure
pier
and
all
these
wharfs
of
this
island
i
say
that
port
aurthur
did
the
shield
was
made
by
the
federal
government
but
most
of
this
work
was
done
after
texas
had
been
put
on
notice
by
the
governor
of
louisiana
in
1941.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
done
what
they
put
on
notice
that
louisiana
was
claiming.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
it
is
very
important
from
louisiana's
standpoint
to
have
the
court
appreciate
the
early
history
of
this
particular
area
as
mr.
mcdaniel
has
mentioned
when
louisiana
was
purchased
from
france
in
1803
there
was
a
dispute
over
what
its
western
boundary
was
going
to
be.
so,
in
1804
they
created
the
territory
of
orleans
which
extended
to
the
33rd
degree
north
latitude
which
is
the
north
boundary
of
louisiana.
so,
in
1806
and
i
think
this
is
very
important,
neither
of
the
special
masters
of
texas
have
really
covered
this
issue,
in
1806,
the
united
states
and
spain,
entered
into
an
agreement
creating
what
was
known
as
a
neutral
zone.
now,
this
neutral
zone
extended
from
the
mermentau
river
up
to
the
red
river.
now
the
red
river
is
part
of
the
mississippi
watershed.
the
big
issue
was
louisiana
was
only
to
cover
the
louisiana
watershed
and
the
louisiana
watershed
fell
somewhere
between
lake
chapala
and
the
mermentau.
so,
spain
had
brought
troops
into
this
area
and
the
united
states
had
brought
troops
in
there
and
they
were
getting
ready
to
have
a
confrontation.
so
they
entered
into
this
agreement
in
1806
and
provided
that
neither
the
united
states
nor
spain
would
occupy
this
area.
they
would
assert
no
jurisdiction
over
it
and
it
really
became
a
no
man’s
land.
and
when
louisiana
was
admitted
as
a
state
in
1812
it
was
admitted
subject
to
this
outstanding
agreement.
louisiana
could
not
take
possession
of
this
area
of
land.
they
could
not
go
in
there
and
could
force
any
laws
at
all.
and
of
course
this
wasn't
settled
until
the
trivia
of
1890.
in
other
words
spain
and
the
united
states
negotiated
a
treaty
and
settled
the
western
boundary
of
the
louisiana
purchase
and
also
the
florida
parish.
of
course
the
boundary
one
could
find
this
to
louisiana,
it
went
on
up
to
the
red
river
and
out
to
the
pacific.
but
when
they
settled
that
boundary
they
settled
it
on
the
west
bank
of
the
sabine
up
to
the
32nd
degree
north
latitude
and
then
north
to
the
33rd
which
is
the
north
west
corner
of
louisiana.
so,
no
patent
were
issued
at
this
area
by
the
united
states.
when
louisiana
was
admitted
as
a
state
the
federal
government
retained
all
un-appropriated
lands.
now
texas
when
it
was
admitted
as
a
state
retained
these
lands.
so,
all
of
the
titles
to
louisiana
lands
emanate
from
the
federal
government
except
now
in
the
streams.
so
during
this
period
there
were
no
titles
issued
in
here
at
all.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
yes,
in
my

mr.

p.

it's
liberty
of
putting

now
texas

a
settlements
along
the
sabine
on
the
west

but
louisiana
have
no
settlements.
all
this
was
marsh
land
and
it
is
marsh
to
date
and
way
up
to
river
its
marsh.
the
only
settlement
was
along
the
western
bank
and
i
think
that's
important
because
as
the
court
will
note
in
my
appendix
i
mentioned
a
letter
from
secretary
of
state
of
the
republic
of
texas
to
the
representative
of
united
states
concerning
an
interpretation
of
the
word
use
in
the
treaty
of
1890.
now,
both
the
special
master
and
texas
have
avoided
a
discussion
of
this
particular
phrase
which
i
think
is
the
main
issue
in
the
case.
now
the
representative
of
the
republic
of
texas
said
the
word
use
meant
to
the
jurisdiction
over
this
water.
you
see
in
the
treaty
both
the
inhabitants
of
texas
and
the
inhabitants
of
louisiana
had
equal
use
and
navigation
of
the
water
which
gave
them
a
use
throughout
the
whole
river
and
this
use
would
not
limit
it
to
navigation,
that
was
something
separate
and
texas
in
this
letter
which
is
in
the
appendix
defines
what
they
consider
this
used
to
be.
they
had
ports
here
and
ships
were
coming
in
and
smuggling
and
they
wanted
to
have
the
right
to
go
out
and
exercise
jurisdiction
to
stop
the
smuggling
which
they
said
they
had
a
right
to
do.
now
this
discussion
was
going
on,
this
was
just
prior
to
1845
when
texas
was
admitted.
so
it
wasn’t
unusual
for
louisiana
in
1848
to
say
that
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
full
jurisdiction
over
the
sabine
even
though
they
own
--
their
boundary
was
on
the
west
bank
because
the
constitution
said
commencing
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
bends
along
the
middle
to
the
33rd
degree
north
latitude
and
in
north
to
the
33rd.
so,
in
this
resolution
as
it
is
read
by
mr.
mcdaniel
accurately,
they
said
that
they
were
talking
about
extending
jurisdiction.
here
were
both
louisiana
and
texas
that
had
equal
jurisdiction
over
this
body
of
water
by
virtue
of
the
use
and
so
it
was
a
question
of
either
louisiana
having
a
full
jurisdiction
or
like
congress
decided
to
do,
they
gave
half
of
the
jurisdiction
to
texas
so
that
they
could
enforce
the
criminal
laws.
now
even
texas,
i
think
it
is
really
important
because
texas
talks
about
the
fact
that
louisiana
being
able
to
acquire
this
territory
without
a
specific
act
of
congress.
in
one
of
texas
briefs,
it
is
a
brief,
plaintiffs
reply
brief
before
the
special
master
on
page
six,
they
admit
that
--
in
other
words,
they
say
louisiana
obtained
title
to
the
unsold
federal
land
adjacent
to
the
texas-houston
land
boundary
line
by
grants
from
the
united
states
government
under
the
swamp
and
overflow
lands
act
after
its
jurisdiction
over
the
area
had
been
recognized
and
acquiesced
in
by
the
united
states
government’s
resurvey
of
such
land
as
a
waste
land
in
1846.
now
what
happened
was
that
before
texas
was
admitted
into
the
union
and
before
they
made
this
joint
survey,
the
united
states
had
gone
in
and
surveyed
a
lot
of
this
land
and
they
had
surveyed
as
part
of
the
land
that
they
considered
louisiana
that
extended
west
of
this
line.
so
when
they
made
this
survey
in
1841,
they
had
to
readjust
these
townships
and
some
of
the
people
that
had
purchased
land
from
the
united
states
government
in
louisiana
received
a
indemnity
for
it
and
so
they
--
that
meant
that
louisiana
had
to
give
up
some
land
out
of
this
area
and
the
lines
were
readjusted
as
texas
admits
in
1846
to
conform
to
this
boundary
agreement
in
1890.
now,
texas,
in
bringing
this
suit,
they
limited
it
to
this
water
boundary,
but
louisiana
feel
that
they
only
way
the
court
can
appreciate
this
boundary
dispute
is
that
it
must
consider
the
total
boundary
of
louisiana.
texas
knew
that
louisiana’s
boundaries
from
the
33rd
to
32nd
degree
north
latitude
would
have
to
be
recognized
as
the
treaty
boundary.
now
they
are
saying
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
the
treaty
boundary
from
the
32nd
degree
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
virtue
of
the
language
in
the
constitution
of
1812
of
louisiana
which
is
the
same
constitution
which
covered
the
northern
boundary
in
which
they
admit
we
are
entitled
to.
so
we
say
that
when
the
court
considered
this
case
in
the
light
of
the
historical
facts
that
this
act,
if
they
would
allow
this
resolution,
show
that
louisiana
considered
that
this
was
their
west
boundary.
they
are
only
asking
to
give
them
the
jurisdiction
and
the
congress
gave
the
jurisdiction
to
texas.
now,
if
it
is
intended
by
this
act
that
they
transfer
this
title
to
texas,
then
under
this
court’s
case
of
mississippi
versus
louisiana,
congress
could
not
deprive
louisiana
of
title
to
its
land.
so,
we
say
that
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
find
all
of
these
maps
and
things
with
this
line
now.
in
other
words,
there
have
been
no
question
about
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
fishing,
hunting
and
various
other
activities
on
these
navigable
bodies
of
water
because
the
citizens
of
both
states
had
equal
rights
unless
you
considered
that
the
jurisdiction
was
going
to
be
exercised
in
limited
areas
by
either
one
of
them.
now,
this
particular
body
of
water
here
is
not
--
as
a
recent
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
brought
about
by
compact
between
texas
and
louisiana
in
1954,
creating
the
toledo
bend
dam.
in
this
compact,
it
was
specifically
stated
that
this
would
not
attempt
to
settle
a
boundary.
in
other
words,
texas
knows
that
there
has
been
a
real
dispute
over
this
boundary
for
many
years
and
they
have
not
been
misled.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
governor
jones
in
1941
wrote
a
letter
to
the
governor
of
texas
stating
that
louisiana
owned
to
the
west
bank
of
the
sabine
under
the
treaty
of
1890.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
gouge,
who
was
then
land
commission
of
texas,
he
claimed
that
texas
owned
150
foot
strip
from
this
point
on
the
sabine,
32nd
to
the
33rd.
in
other
words,
at
that
time,
they
were
trying
to
claim
that
they
owned
over
to
louisiana’s
boundary
under
what
they
said
the
wording
of
the
constitution.
now
they
admit
that
louisiana
owns
it.
so
it
all
goes
to
show
that
texas
really
has
never
had
any
claim,
had
any
doubt
that
louisiana
has
its
plan.
now
they
thought
that
they
would
bring
in
a
picture
like
this
that
shows
the,
all
this
field
here.
well
actually
all
this
field
was
done
by
the
corps
of
engineers
in
digging
these
channels
and
this
was
not
done
by
texas.
the
fact
that
texas
has
used
some
of
them
and
of
course
the
united
states
has
a
navigational
easement
over
this
whole
body
of
water.
so
we
say
that
louisiana
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it—
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
the
put
all
the
people
who
built
it
on
this
field,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
no,
no
i
am
not
trying
to
see
it.
i
was
trying
to
say
the
field
was
built
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
now
they
have
built
on
that
but
most
of
that
was
built
after
1941
when
they
were
put
on
orders
by
governor
jones
that
louisiana
claimed
of
the
west
bank.
so
we
--
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
i
was
saying
that
--
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
yes
it
answers
justice
marshall.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
he
asked
me
who
built
on
this
--
the
pleasure
pier
and
all
these
wharfs
of
this
island
i
say
that
port
aurthur
did
the
shield
was
made
by
the
federal
government
but
most
of
this
work
was
done
after
texas
had
been
put
on
notice
by
the
governor
of
louisiana
in
1941.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
done
what
they
put
on
notice
that
louisiana
was
claiming.
