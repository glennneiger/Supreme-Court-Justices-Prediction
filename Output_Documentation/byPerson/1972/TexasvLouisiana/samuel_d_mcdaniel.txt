mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
former
governor
and
senator,
daniel
asked
me
to
express
to
you
his
regrets
that
he
could
not
appear
and
argue
this
case.
he
has
been
appointed
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
our
canons
of
judicial
ethics
prevent
him
from
appearing
in
that,
but
he
did
handled
the
case
before
the
special
master.
the
maps
which
are
behind
me,
one
you
have
an
individual
map
which
i
have
had
furnished
to
the
court,
the
large
map
is
furnished
by
mr.
stockwell,
the
counsel
of
louisiana.
i
apologize
to
the
court
that
only
three
of
the
copies
which
should
be
in
justice
marshall,
the
chief
justice
and
justice
blackmun’s
hand,
so
that
all
of
you
can
see
for
reference
purposes.
i
have
all
the
colored
copies
that
the
geological
survey
offers
here
in
washington
had
of
the
map,
the
others
are
reproductions
made
here.
i
will
refer
to
that
map
some
in
the
later
part
of
my
argument.
it’s
a
duplication
of
texas
exhibit
a47.
as
i
understand
the
procedure
that
is
to
be
followed
in
this
case,
there
will
be
no
rebuttal,
even
if
i
wanted
to
save
time
for
it.
so,
i
asked
the
court
to
please
ask
any
questions
that
you
may
have,
concerning
any
arguments
that
mr.
stockwell
has
raised
in
his
brief
in
order
that
i
may
have
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
them
and
i
also,
unless
the
court
have
some
question
about
it,
we
will
pass
over
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
course
and
also
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
united
states
is
a
necessary
party.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
was
the
arrangement
that
we
were
told
by
the
clerk,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
alright.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
am
glad
to
have
the
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no,
i
understand,
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
i
will
do
that.
let
me
commend
judge
wentall,
the
special
master,
not
only
because
i
believe
in
by
far
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
i
understand.
let
me
command
judge
for
his
report
which
in
the
great
part
i
speak
and
support
of.
we
have
one
exception
that
we
took
two
years
report.
really
it
did,
is
more
of
quibble
than
an
exception
almost
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
should
cover
that
last
in
my
argument.
i
particularly
command
judge
wentall
and
command
your
use
the
appendix
of
the
evidence
which
he
has
put
in
the
report
which
is
in
great
detail,
discussing
the
various
individual
exhibits
that
he
considers
to
support
his
findings.
this
is
a
boundary
case
as
you
know
and
it’s
over
the
texas,
louisiana
boundary,
blow
the
32nd
degree
of
north
latitude
which
is
the
boundary
in
the
sabine
river.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
with
one
minor
exception.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
the
32nd
degree
of
north
latitude
is
the
point
at
which
the
sabine
river
ceases
to
be
the
boundary
between
texas
and
louisiana.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
i’ll
discuss
the
specific
language
of
the
boundary
in
a
moment
and
its
significance
to
the
case.
texas
claims
by
grant
from
the
united
states
made
by
act
of
congress
on
july
the
5th
1848
and
also
claims
title
by
prescription
and
equity
assets.
now,
it
should
be
pointed
out
here
i
think,
because
this
does
bear
on
the
point
of
whether
or
not
the
united
states
should
conceivably
be
a
party
in
this
lawsuit.
the
area
which
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit
was
never
a
part
of
the
republic
of
texas
and
is
not
a
part
of
texas'
historic
claim.
we
claim
purely
as
a
grantee
of
the
united
states.
louisiana
claims
by
theory
of
agency
or
osmosis
or
something
to
have
had
prior
title
in
1848
as
a
result
of
the
treaty
of
1819
with
spain,
settling
the
territory
of
boundaries
of
the
united
states
and
spain.
this
treaty
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
louisiana.
to
texas,
the
basic
question
in
the
lawsuit
is
as
between
the
united
states
and
louisiana
on
july
5th
1848
who
had
title
to
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river
including
sabine
lake
and
sabine
pass.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that’s
correct,
at
least
certain
on
it
so
far
is
the
lawsuit
shows,
the
record
in
the
case
shows.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that's
correct,
we
contend
that
congress
never
granted
the
area
in
dispute
to
louisiana
and
the
louisiana
steering
of
the
case
in
addition
to
be
being
wrong
because
the
instruments
just
don’t
grant
it
to
louisiana,
is
constitutionally
wrong
because
article
4
section
3
gives
the
congress
the
exclusive
power
to
dispose
as
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
the
first
senate
to
the
constitution
defines
the
congress
is
consisting
of
the
senate
and
a
house
of
representatives.
and
the
treaty
which
acquired
property
for
the
united
states
is
an
executive
action
right
across
by
the
senate
and
it
cannot
dispose
the
property
to
one
of
the
states
of
the
union.
the
history
of
the
thing
starts
with
the
1803
purchase
of
louisiana
at
a
time,
when
the
westward
claim
of
the
louisiana
purchase
was
completely
unsettled.
jefferson
and
many
other
prominent
people
thought
that
the
claim
extended
clear
to
the
rio
grande.
in
1811,
the
congress
authorized
the
formation
of
the
state
of
louisiana
from
the
orleans
territory.
part
of
the
language,
the
part
of
the
description
relative
to
the
case
is
in
the
special
master's
report
on
page
41.
what
i’m
reading
is
from
the
statutes
at
large,
which
has
a
little
more
in
it
than
the
master
quoted.
it
reads
that
the
inhabitants
of
all
that
part
of
the
territory,
are
country
ceded
under
the
name
of
louisiana
and
then
it
talks
about
the
session
from
france.
contained
within
the
following
limits,
that
is
to
say
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine,
thence
by
land
to
be
drawn
along
the
middle
of
said
river,
including
all
islands
to
the
32nd
degree
of
latitude.
the
louisiana
constitution
of
1812
is
in
virtually
identical
language
except
that
it
inserts
the
word
if
between
all
and
islands
and
the
1812
act
of
admission
by
the
congress,
it
i
believe
in
precisely
the
same
language,
the
if
is
not
in
yet.
now,
the
1812
act
admitting
louisiana
as
a
state
is
also
pertinent
it
seems
to
us
in
another
regard
because
section
3
of
that
act
reads
this
way,
that
the
sub-state,
speaking
of
louisiana,
together
with
the
residue
of
that
portion
of
country
which
was
comprehended
within
the
territory
of
orleans,
as
constituted
by
the
act
entitling
an
act
directing
louisiana
into
two
territories
and
providing
contemporary
governments.
there
shall
be
one
district
and
be
called
the
louisiana
district
and
that
should
the
established
in
the
said
district,
a
district
court
who
consist
of
one
judge.
and
in
the
1850
publication
of
the
statute
at
large
which
is
the
ones,
we
have
down
in
texas,
there
is
one
of
these
little
marginal
squabs
here
that
says,
the
inhabitance
of
louisiana
within
directed
limits,
to
be
authorized
to
form
a
constitution
and
state.
we
contend
that
the
congress
of
course
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing
and
were
acting
within
what
was
the
normal
procedure
of
directing
state
boundary
in
the
middle
of
the
stream,
when
they
defined
louisiana's
eastern
boundary
up
to
the
32nd
degree
of
the
latitude
here
as
being
in
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river.
it
becomes
a
lawsuit
on
a
controversy
because
of
the
1819
treaty
with
spain.
when
that
treaty
was
executed
after
a
considerable
period
of
negotiation,
the
treaty
called
for
the
boundary
between
the
two
countries
to
be
the
western
bank
of
the
sabine,
starting
at
the
westward
mouth
of
the
sabine
and
then
up
to
the
western
bank.
this
treaty
was
ratified
by
mexico
in
1828
by
the
republic
of
texas.
in
1838,
the
boundary
was
actually
surveyed
in
1840-41
by
the
joint
commission
of
the
republic
of
texas
and
the
united
states
and
was
marked
on
the
ground.
and
that
was
the
extent
of
texas'
historic
claim.
in
1845
of
course,
we
had
the
annexation
of
texas
into
the
union
or
its
president
polk
referred
to
it
in
his
inaugural
address,
the
reannexation
of
texas
into
the
union.
now,
we
don't
think
that
there's
anything
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary
about
the
fact
that
the
people
who
were
leaders
in
this
country
in
the
other
part
of
the
last
century,
fully
expected
that
there
will
be
more
states
organized
to
the
westward
of
louisiana,
certainly
president
jackson
and
others
never
ceased
their
efforts,
to
get
texas
and
ultimately
they
did.
the
next
act
of
significance
in
this
controversy
is
important
enough,
that
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
will
read
it
to
you,
it's
on
page
42
of
the
special
master’s
report,
it's
a
resolution
not
by
some
pretty
functionary
of
the
government
of
louisiana,
but
a
solemn
declaration
of
the
louisiana
legislature
passed
in
1848.
it
reads
as
follows.
“whereas
the
constitution
and
the
laws
in
the
state
of
louisiana
nor
those
of
any
other
state
or
territory
extend
over
the
waters
of
the
sabine
river
in
the
middle
of
said
stream
to
the
western
bank
thereof.
and
it
is
of
importance
to
the
citizens
living
contiguous
thereto
and
to
the
people
in
general
that
the
jurisdiction
of
some
state
should
be
extended
over
said
territory
in
order
that
crimes
and
offenses
committed
thereon
should
be
punished
and
wrongs
and
damages
inflicted
should
be
redressed
in
a
speedy
and
convenient
manner.
therefore,
be
it
resolved
by
the
senate
house
of
representatives
of
the
state
of
louisiana
in
general
assembly
convened,
first
that
the
constitution
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
louisiana
shall
be
extended
over
part
of
the
united
states
embraced
in
the
following
limits
(whenever
the
consent
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
be
procured
there
too),
there
is
between
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river
and
the
western
bank
to
begin
at
the
mouth
of
said
river,
where
it
enters
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
thence
to
continue
along
to
the
said
western
bank
to
the
place
where
it
intersects
the
32nd
degree
of
north
latitude,
it
being
the
boundary
line
between
the
said
state
of
louisiana
and
the
state
of
texas.”
counsel
of
louisiana
argued
that
this
is
an
assertion
of
louisiana’s
boundary
to
the
west
bank.
we
argue
the
exact
contrary
that
it
is
an
admission
by
the
louisiana
legislature
that
they
did
not
own
the
west
bank
and
petitioned
to
congress
to
allow
and
to
extend
their
boundaries,
two
only.
texas
passed
a
similar
resolution
in
the
same
month
of
1848
and
sent
it
to
congress.
congress
denied
louisiana’s
petition
and
granted
texas'
petition
and
on
july
05,
1848,
passed
the
act
consenting
to
texas
to
extend
her
boundary
over
the
eastern
half
of
the
sabine
river.
i
would
like
to
read
out
particular
language
because
it
is
relevant
to
an
argument
that
i
make
a
little
further
on.
“be
it
enacted
and
so
forth
that
the
congress
consent
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
to
extend
her
eastern
boundaries,
so
as
to
include
within
her
limits
one-half
of
sabine
pass,
one-half
of
sabine
lake
and
also
one-half
of
the
sabine
river
from
its
mouth
as
far
north
is
a
32nd
degree
of
north
latitude.
now,
the
congress
apparently
realized
full
well,
that
louisiana
did
not
own
this
area
and
that
the
united
states
did
because
on
page
43
of
the
master’s
report
is
quoted
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
own
this
bill
and
then
the
last
paragraph
appearing
on
the
page
says,
mr.
butler
asked
for
the
immediate
consideration
of
the
bill
and
briefly
explained
it's
character.
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
it
was
known
embraced
the
sabine
river
and
lake
to
its
western
shore.
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
louisiana
extended
to
the
middle
of
the
sabine.
so
that
the
half
of
the
river
and
lake
to
the
western
shore
belonged
to
the
united
states
and
was
not
included
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
therefore,
the
boundary
of
the
state
and
that
of
the
united
states
was
not
identical.
the
bill
before
the
senate
gives
the
half
of
the
river
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
louisiana
to
the
state
of
texas
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
later
to
extend
her
criminal
jurisdiction
to
the
louisiana
boundary.
louisiana
has
also
argued
that
all
the
bill
does
is
allow
texas
to
extend
its
criminal
jurisdiction,
but
of
course
it
does
more,
it
allows
them
to
extend
their
boundary,
that
is
the
way
they
are
allowing
them
to
extend
their
criminal
jurisdiction.
and
then
it
concludes
mr.
johnson
of
louisiana
and
mr.
downs
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
louisiana
expressed
the
acquiescence
in
the
arrangement,
which
of
course
were
their
two
senators
at
that
time.
contrary
to
the
statement
in
the
master’s
report
on
page
9
which
i
think
is
in
inadvertence,
the
statement
of
the
second
question
is
the
doctrine
of
acquiescence
in
prescription
applied
to
the
plans
of
either
state
and
if
so,
what
is
his
application
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
louisiana
has
never
pled
nor
claimed
title
by
acquiescence
in
prescription
in
this
lawsuit
and
we
contend
that
on
the
law,
texas
is
entitled
to
judgment
confirming
her
title
in
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river.
turning
to
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
i
am
going
to
talk
about
them
little
later,
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
any
specific
question
you
had
at
this
time
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
texas
claims
that
the
ones
in
the
western
half
by
prescription.
louisiana
does
not
claim
any
islands
by
prescription.
they
claim
as
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
that
is
their
claim
for
the
islands.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that’s
correct,
only
texas
makes
that
claim.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes.
i
suppose
in
a
broad
sense
they
are
and
we
concede
that
a
line
drawn
along
the
middle
of
the
river
when
it
intersects
the
line
would
have
to
go
in
the
western
channel,
so
that
it
would
leave
that
island
on
louisiana’s
side.
but
we
do
not
concede
that
an
island
completely
on
the
western
side
of
the
river
over
and
the
western
half
of
the
river
would
be
louisiana’s
island.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that’s
correct.
even
if
they
were
in
existence
in
1812.
as
a
fact,
the
matter
and
this
is
the
reason
i
have
said
that
our
exception
was
more
equable.
there
are
few
if
any
islands
presently
in
the
river
that
was
there
in
1812.
there
were
very
few
islands
in
the
river
at
all.
now,
even
most
of
the
ones
that
are
shown
on
some
of
these
maps
are
not
there.
we
feel
confident
that
the
ones
we
are
interested
in
at
least
we
could
prove
title
to
that
via
prescription
because
texas
had
used
them
and
may
do
so
for
many
years.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no,
the
treaty
admitting
louisiana
--
i
mean
the
statute
admitting
louisiana
into
the
union
in
1812
provides
for
free
ride
of
navigation
to
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
all
other
states
and
the
treaty
of
1819
with
spain,
if
that
is
of
any
benefit
to
texas
and
there
are
some
questions
where
it
would
be
in
this
context
or
not
and
it
also
provides
for
a
free
navigation
of
the
sabine,
even
though
the
boundary
is
placed
by
that
treaty
on
the
west
bank.
the
special
master
on
the
issue
of
prescription
and
acquiescence
has
detailed
a
great
deal
of
evidence
and
even
what
he
details
is
not
all
of
it.
what
i
am
going
to
briefly
summarize
is
not
all
of
what
he
details
either.
on
maps
that
he
discusses
are
supported
with
his
finding
in
favor
of
texas.
he
discusses
12
mouths
by
texas,
18
by
the
federal
government
and
31
by
louisiana
all
which
recognized
the
mid
boundary.
this
is
a
typical
map.
you'll
notice
down
here
in
the
center
of
the
bottom
that
says
the
sale
by
the
us
geological
survey,
at
denver
and
washington
and
the
state
of
louisiana
department
of
public
works,
bad
moves.
this
is
their
map,
the
federal
government’s
map,
it
is
not
texas'
map.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well,
we
don't
say
that
is
conclusive,
your
honor,
we
just
say
that
it's
notice
to
them
in
their
own
instrument,
but
there
is
a
claim
here
that
in
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river
that
has
existed
for
many,
many
years
and
they
have
done
nothing
about
it.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well,
i
do
not
think
that
when
you
are
talking
about
acquiescence
and
prescription,
you’re
talking
about
the
same
thing
as
an
admission
against
interest
in
the
normal
sense.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no,
no,
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
i
agree
with
you
that
whoever
drew
the
map
could
not
make
an
admission
against
interest,
they
would
be
binding
against
the
state
of
louisiana,
it's
only
an
evidential
fact.
as
to
leases,
there
are
32
texas
sand
and
gravel
and
shore
leases
that
go
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
the
master
refers
to
a
whole
list
of
texas
oil
and
gas
leases
and
some
pipeline
easement.
there
are
32
louisiana
mineral
leases
to
the
middle
of
the
river
and
five
louisiana
pipeline
leads
us
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
both
states
have
closed
parts
of
their
respective
half
of
sabine
lake
to
ouster
dredging
because
of
pollution.
the
federal
rivers
and
harbors
appropriations
made
to
texas
over
the
years
for
use
in
the
sabine
have
been
numerous
which
the
special
master
found
to
be
a
federal
recognition
of
texas'
title.
the
period
1852
to
1913
there
were
61
such
appropriations
and
the
period
1914
to
1969
there
were
40
such
appropriations.
texas
has
participated
with
the
state
of
louisiana
in
erection
of
eight
bridges
across
the
sabine
river
which
were
built
to
and
maintained
to
and
policed
to
the
middle
by
both
states.
taxes
are
assessed
by
both
states
on
pipelines
and
railroad
bridges
across
the
sabine
river
on
the
basis
of
the
division
line
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
this
arrangement
has
been
worked
out
particularly
by
kansas
city
southern
railway
company
which
owned
more
than
one
of
the
bridges
across
the
river
with
the
officials
of
both
states.
police
jurisdiction;
both
states
through
their
highway
patrols
and
their
wildlife
officers,
patrol
to
the
middle
line.
on
the
map,
you
will
note
a
long
sliver
land
right
off
the
port
arthur.
this
is
pleasure
island
which
you
probably
recall
from
the
special
master's
report,
it's
an
area
of
3000
acres
which
has
been
reclaimed
from
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river.
that
reclamation
work
started
in
1911
and
louisiana
has
never
made
one
peep
about
texas
doing
it.
pleasure
island
contains
a
grass
course,
it
contains
a
pleasure
pier
in
marina,
it
contains
the
reserved
army
and
marine
training
station
and
it
contains
a
part
of
amusement
area,
in
addition
to
just
having
land
out
there.
it
also
is
reached
by
a
very
high
span
bridge
under
which
large
freighters
and
tankers
can
sail
with
sufficient
clarity.
port
arthur
is
the
12
port
in
the
united
states
towards
seaport
in
terms
of
tonnage
and
beaumont,
which
also
uses
this
channel
which
is
right
up
the
neches
river
here
out
of
lake
sabine
is
the
eighth
largest
port
in
the
united
states.
together,
i
believe
their
combine
tonnage
makes
them
the
fourth
largest
port
behind
new
york,
new
orleans
and
houston.
the
evidence
of
prescription
as
voluminous
as
it
is,
in
all
of
these
little
acts
is
not
merely
as
strong
as
four
things
which
i
will
now
detail
to
court
which
seem
to
me
to
be
very
strong
on
this
point.
first
of
course
is
the
solemn
declaration
of
the
louisiana
legislature
which
we
read
a
few
moments
ago,
expressly
admitting
that
they
do
not
own
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river.
that
was
followed
by
another
legislative
act
which
the
master's
report
mentions
on
page
106
in
the
form
of
an
appropriation
by
the
louisiana
legislature
in
1857,
a
$15,000
for
improvement
of
the
navigation
of
the
sabine
river
condition
upon
texas
making
a
like
appropriation
for
a
like
purpose.
in
1901
we
have
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
which
has
been
affirmed
three
or
four
times
since,
holding
that
louisiana
did
not
owned
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river
and
could
not
exercise
criminal
jurisdiction
therein.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
somewhat
amusing
and
are
pertinent
i
think.
the
de
soto,
a
parish
louisiana
in
shelby
county
of
texas
both
border
on
the
river.
apparently
gambling
was
illegal
in
shelby
county
of
texas
and
the
retail
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
was
against
the
law
in
the
de
soto
parish,
louisiana.
so
mr.
burton
hit
up
on
the
solution
of
anchoring
his
gambling
establishment
in
louisiana’s
half
of
the
river
and
his
whiskey
establishment
in
the
western
half
of
the
river
and
rigging
up
a
system
of
pulley
ropes
between
them
so
that
you
could
step
on
a
dingy
and
just
pull
yourself
down
the
rope
over
to
the
bar
if
you
wanted
to
and
get
a
drink
and
then
come
back
to
the
gambling
establishment.
the
louisiana
officials
prosecuted
in
for
selling
alcoholic
beverages
at
retail
in
de
soto
parish,
without
a
license
and
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
that
although
this
was
manifestly
an
attempt
to
subvert
the
law,
nevertheless
louisiana
could
not
extend
its
jurisdiction
over
texas
territory
by
the
means
of
a
rope.
and
next
time
he
got
caught
a
year
later,
he
miscalculated
the
mid-river
and
they
put
him
in
jail.
in
1938,
we
have
several
releases,
these
are
discussed
on
page
68
to
69
of
the
master’s
report,
signed
by
the
governor
of
louisiana
which
not
only
call
for
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river,
but
call
for
the
boundary
as
set
by
the
act
of
congress
of
july
5,
1848.
also
in
1938
we
have
an
opinion
issued
by
the
louisiana
attorney
general’s
office,
advising
a
man
in
monroe,
louisiana
is
to
igoe,
i
believe
it
is,
this
is
at
page
69
and
70
of
special
master’s
report,
that
the
louisiana
boundary
was
set
by
act
of
congress
of
april
6,
1812,
that
is
the
act
of
admission
to
find
him
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
the
texas
boundary
by
act
of
congress
of
july
5,
1848.
the
man
had
written
in
and
apparently
he
had
gotten
a
lease
which
purported
to
give
him
all
of
the
river
bottom
and
he
wanted
to
know
whether
he
got
all
or
half
and
the
louisiana
attorney
general
said
he
got
only
half.
so
we
have
the
declaration
by
all
of
three
of
the
department’s
of
government
in
louisiana.
the
legislature
in
1848,
the
supreme
court
at
1901
and
subsequently
and
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
in
1938
all
clearly
recognizing
that
texas
owned
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river.
in
our
answer
to
all
that
louisiana
alleges
that
three
parishes
purported
to
extend
that
boundary
to
the
west
bank.
i
would
point
out
to
this
that
all
three
of
those
attempts
were
before
the
act
of
congress
of
july
12,
1848
and
from
the
date
of
the
act
of
congress
on
july
12,
1848
until
the
inception
of
the
controversy
with
the
beginning
of
oil
and
gas
activity
in
the
area
about
1940-41,
there
was
a
no
question
of
title.
the
special
master
refers
to
the
desirability
of
having
settled
these
cases
years
ago
and
quotes
of
the
first
justice
harlan's
comment
to
that
effect
in
united
states
versus
texas
in
1895-96,
the
simple
truth
is
that
100
years
ago
there
was
certainly
no
controversy
about
this
plan.
louisiana
also
argues
that
thalweg
should
be
applied,
we
say
that
it
is
not
applicable
in
this
case
for
four
reasons.
number
one,
there
is
no
reason
for
it
where
navigational
rights
are
not
at
issue
and
we
cite
georgia
versus
south
carolina
for
that
proposition.
secondly,
we
say
that
the
prescription
and
acquiescence
establish
a
line
to
the
geographic
center
of
the
sabine
river
and
that
prescription
and
acquiescence
would
overcome
the
thalweg
doctrine
in
any
event.
thirdly,
and
this
is
not
mentioned
by
the
master,
there
is
considerable
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
is
no
thalweg
in
sabine
lake.
the
map
show
a
reasonable
uniform
depth
throughout
the
lake,
there
is
even
one
in
the
record
made
in
1777
that
has
uniform
soundings
throughout
the
lake.
and
fourthly,
and
the
master
emphasized
this,
the
act
of
congress
of
july
5th,
1848
indicated
that
it
was
the
view
of
congress
that
texas
was
together
at
one
half,
one
half,
one
half
not
merely
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
as
to
the
allowance
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
it
shifts
to
some
extent,
but
not
merely
enact
like
the
mississippi
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
as
a
practical
matter
the
geographic
center
would
be
far
easier
to
apply.
in
sabine
lake
for
example
you
would
have
to
go
out
there
and
i
suppose
take
specific
soundings
all
through
the
lake
to
try
to
find
a
channel
through
it,
which
we
don't
believe
would
be
found.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
on
the
island
question,
we
think
that
the
special
master
only
was
interpreting
the
phrase
including
all
islands
to
refer
to
the
whole
river
rather
than
the
area
of
the
river
defined
by
the
call
for
a
line
to
be
drawn
along
the
middle
of
the
said
river.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
on
this
map,
your
honor
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
alright,
the
sabine
island
after
which
we
recognize
is
in
louisiana.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
the
islands
coming
to
the
west
there,
western
middle
pass
sydney
island
those
are
spoil
banks
and
they
are
not
islands.
(inaudible)
island
is
not
an
island
at
all,
it's
an
area
cut
off
by
the
inter
coastal
canal
of
the
mainland.
the
little
area
there
that
is
called
doom's
island.
there
is
some
controversy
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
in
the
sabine
in
1812
or
not,
it
is
not
there
now,
so
it
probably
doesn't
make
too
much
difference
unless
the
court
should
decide
that
louisiana’s
line
is
entitled
to
be
swung
to
the
west
of
furtherest
island
then
it
might
become
pertinent.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
sydney
island
is
spoil
bank
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
you
see
the
intercoastal
canal
run
drive
there
behind,
it's
spoil,
the
inter
coastal
canal.
in
fact
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
island
controversy
is
not
too
significant
to
the
the
lawsuit
is
because
with
the
possible
exception
of
dooms
island
we
do
not
believe
there
are
any
island
there
that
were
there
in
1812.
the
all
–
oh
my
time
has
expired
i
am
sorry.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
channel
here
is
shown
to
be
12
feet
deep
which
is
the
normal
channel
of
the
inter
coastal
canal.
in
fact
i
feel
sorry
that
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
dispute
about
this,
the
ship
channel
which
comes
out
of
port
aurthur
and
then
goes
going
out
to
the
neches
to
belmont
is
considerably
deeper
that
that
because
it
uses
this
full
size
tankers
and
freighters
all
the
time
and
they
draw
more
than
12
feet,
but
they
do
use
that
area
and
not
sabine
lake.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
there
is
only
one
that
i
know
of
in
a
place
called
the
marrows
and
that
was
decided
by
the
department
of
the
interior
i
believe
in
1910
to
belong
to
louisiana,
that
it
should
be
measured
from
the
western
channel
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
i
would
say
it
is
more
of
a
quibble
really
than
an
exception
about
the
thing.
the
only
thing
that
scares
also
a
little
about
the
islands
is
that
the
the
court
should
determine
as
louisiana
contends
that
the
boundary
should
come
over
here
if
they
can
prove
say
the
dooms
island
existed
in
1812,
and
fix
the
boundary
on
the
west
side
of
dooms
islands
because
dooms
island
actually
is
the
little
beyond
island
in
the
mouth
of
the
neches
river.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
that
gets
us
back
to
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
an
interest
in
it
or
not
and
my
answer
to
that
is
this
your
honor,
it
does
have
an
interest
in
the
starting
point,
yes
as
to
the
boundary
between
louisiana
and
texas.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
where
there
is
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
on
the
west
bank.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
this
does
not
affect
the
united
states,
i
do
think
because
as
to
the
united
states
the
three
league
limit
only
comes
as
far
as
our
historic
boundary.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
the
congress
does
consider
ports
to
extend
it
here
anymore
than
they
have
consented
ports
to
extend
it
up
here
in
north
to
the
32
degree
latitude,
so
we
have
no
controversy.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
it
is
affected
and
most
states
have
stipulated
that
that
issue
is
to
be
excluded
from
this
lawsuit.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
now
it
will
determine
it
obviously
but
this
lawsuit
will
not
determine,
what
tangent
that
line
should
take,
whether
it
should
be
perpendicular
from
the
coast
or
whether
it
should
follow
some
other
line.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well,
we
are
saying,
mr.
justice
that
actually
as
far
as
i
can
understand,
as
far
as
the
records
show,
if
i
wasn't
in
this
in
the
beginning
so
i
certainly
wouldn’t
having
a
first
knowledge
it?
the
world
war
took
place
in
’41
which
we
all
know
about
that
and
then
soon
after
that,
texas
and
louisiana
got
involved
in
the
title
and
litigation
and
from
all
the
information
we
have,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
i
argued
the
matter
before
judge
van
pelt,
i
mentioned
that
fact
that
it
was
not
disputed,
that
there
was
kind
of
a
gentleman’s
understanding
that
neither
side
would
do
anything
pending
the
settlement
of
this
title
and
litigation.
but
texas
settled
and
had
immediately
file
a
suit
and
we
say
that
there
has
been
no
evidence
to
refute
it
although
in
their
brief
they
say
--
they
now
deny
that
but
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
is
exactly
what
--
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
your
honor
because
of
the
fact
that
we
had
put
them
on
notice
and
decided
not
to
do
anything
pending
this
title
end.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
filing
this
very
suit,
texas
asked
us
not
to
bring
in
the
title
ends
issue
on
it
which
like
justice
stewart
said,
we
are
going
to
have
to
settle
someday,
where
the
line
is
going
to
start
and
what
direction
it
is
going
to
take
into
the
gulf.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no
sir,
i
am
not
trying
to
do
that.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
i
do
not
think
they
intend
to
make
this
but
of
course
mr.
justice
marshall,
actually
many
things
are
built
on
fields
in
navigable
streams
without
affecting
the
title
to
the
subsoil.
in
other
words
viewing
in
this
--
if
the
federal
corps
of
engineers
give
port
aurthur
a
right
to
put
these
works
after
that.
that
doesn't
mean
they
would
have
title
to
the
subsoil
on
which
these
field
are
been
made
and
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
we
are
making
in
here.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
we
take
to
position,
justice
marshall
that
it
was
–
in
the
interest
of
both
parties,
this
was
a
navigable
stream.
both
parties
wanted
to
have
commerce
across
it.
now,
the
testimony
would
show
that
these
bridges
were
loaned
to
one
point
into
river,
they
were
in
half
and
half
all
the
way
across.
in
other
words
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no
sir
but
we,
some
of
our
people
testified
they
did
arrest
all
the
way
across,
i
would
say
that
most
haven’t
recognized
the
division
line,
i
mean
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
the
court.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
it
was
along
somewhere
in
there,
they
were
thinking
about
it
from
their
jurisdiction
but
i
think
as
far
as
the
bridges
were
concerned,
they
were
built
maybe
on
a
50-50
basis
and
they
owned
the
whole
bridge
together
and
i
think
you
would
see
from
the
testimony
there
were
not
any
line
picked
out
in
any
part
of
the
river.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
i
would
agree
generally
with
that
premise,
your
honor
but
i
feel
if
the
parties
mutually
understand,
that
they
have
got
another
matter
to
settle
and
they
are
not
going
to
litigate
over
it,
then
i
think
that
is
another
matter.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
i
think
it
would
have
it
then
because
states
really
act
a
little
different
than
the
individuals.
i
mean
i
think
that
it
is
harder
to
get
them
to
get
into
lawsuits
with
each
other,
in
particular
for
any
state.
i
mean
i
think
that
is
a
matter
that
certainly,
i
do
not
think
if
you
would
--
but
we
say
that
beyond
that,
that
they
agree
that
they
would
not
litigate
this
pending
this
title
end
litigation
which
is
evidently
in
this
very
case
because
we
are
not
litigating
the
part
that
extends
into
the
gulf.
now
your
honor
we
fell
that
the
question
of
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
we
do
not
make
that
as
a
reference
to
one
state,
one
state
to
another
state.
now
we
would
make
it
as
the
individuals.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
it
could
acquire
title
by
acquiescence
and
prescription,
i
mean
settle
the
boundaries.
so
i
want
to
accept
what
this
court
said
on
it,
that
as
far
as
between
the
states
that
you
would
not,
in
other
words,
we
could
not
say
prescription
would
run
against
louisiana
in
favor
of
texas
or
vice
versa.
so
i
would
think
if
it
is
an
individual,
there
would
be
a
different
problem.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
texas
had
this
very
same
problem
in
one
of
that,
in
the
mexican
boundary.
in
the
case
of
fergosa
(ph),
they
had
a
treaty
in
1905
in
which
they
settled
some
bancos
as
they
call
it
which
is
made
by
the
rio
grande
river.
now
part
of
these
bancos
were
taken
from
mexico
and
given
to
united
states
in
part
to
mexico.
now
the
question
came
up
in
this
case
as
whether
or
not
a
party
acquired
a
title
to
one
of
these
bancos
by
limitation.
and
the
only
way
he
could
acquire
that
title
was
if
texas
got
title
to
this
banco
by
virtue
of
the
treaty
and
not
by
virtue
of
some
acts
that
was
passed
in
1823
--
1923
and
the
court
held
that
when
the
united
states
and
mexico
settle
this
boundary,
that
those
lands
merely
became
part
of
texas
and
it
didn’t
need
any
further
action.
they
said
texas
had
given
up
some
land
and
they
acquired
some
land
and
that
is
the
same
thing
as
louisiana
has
done
here.
the
question
(inaudible)
we
say
that
(inaudible)
louisiana
is
in
this
position,
this
is
an
alternative
plea,
if
the
court
feel
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
it.
this
court
is
held
into
the
case
of
the
state
of
louisiana
versus
mississippi
that
the
thalweg
applied
to
the
east
boundary
of
louisiana
in
the
pearl
river
and
extending
all
down
into
the
gulf
interpreting
the
same
language
and
the
constitution
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
the
middle
of
the
sabine,
the
middle
of
the
pearl
and
the
question
they
both
have
arrived
at
navigation
and
of
course
we
feel
that
certainly,
this
court,
in
making
other
cases
dealing
with
navigable
streams
where
you
have
equal
rights
of
navigation
have
always
held
that
the
thalweg
applied.
now
the
case
of
georgia
versus
north
carolina
is
kind
of
an
unusual
case
and
we
do
not
believe
that
that
was
more
or
less,
the
parties
more
or
less
admitted
themselves
in
that
kind
of
a
position
but
we
feel
that
the
majority
of
the
jurisprudence
in
particular
interpret
their
own
constitution.
this
court
has
held
but
the
thalweg
rule
would
apply
if
you
feel
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
the
west
bank
boundary.
now
as
far
as
orleans,
i
want
to
make
a
quick
reference
to
that.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
it
made
quite
a
little—
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
your
honor
it
makes
a
good
deal
of
difference
as
to
how
they
come
out
of
the
sabine,
at
the
sabine
pass.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
can
see
they
have
done
a
lot
of
channel
work
in
here.
now
the
question
is
what
do
we
entitle
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
are
we
entitled
in
1848?
see
it
was
about
four
part
orleans
up
here
and
the
channel
came
out,
in
other
words
when
they
made
the
survey
in
1840-1841,
they
made
it
on
the
west
bank
of
the
furtherest
island
so
we
say
that
it
would
make
a
lot
of
difference
in
coming
out
of
here.
now
in
that
survey,
they
also
found
what
they
called
doom’s
island
right
of
the
neches.
that
was
in
the
survey
and
referred
to
it.
they
made
--
in
other
words
they
made
notes
of
all
of
the
surveys
so
they
referred
to
that.
now
if
you
follow
the
case
of
south
carolina
and
georgia,
then
the
court,
if
the
language
of
that
case
would
be
accepted,
would
take
the
channel
west
of
these
islands,
that
is
what
they
did
in
that
case.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
is
right.
so
--
and
then
they
all
hound
up
the
river
by
the
two.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
kind
of
unusual,
your
honors
because
texas,
in
their
motion
for
judgment
and
memorandum
with
respect
to
the
motion,
on
page
nine,
they
admitted
this,
they
say
that
congress
permitted
louisiana
to
include
within
its
state
boundary
all
of
the
eastern
half
of
the
sabine
including
all
islands
within
the
stream.
so
we
say
that
they
only
changed
their
position
later
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
letter
from
mr.
gouge
that
urged
the
same
thing.
in
other
words,
he
urged
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
west
half,
exclusion
of
all
the
islands.
so,
texas
in
its
own
brief,
and
they
already
stated
in
this
case,
they
admitted
louisiana
was
entitled
to
all
of
the
islands
in
the
sabine.
so
we
say
this
is
important
to
be
considered
by
the
court
to
consider
in
this
case.
i
certainly
thank
you
gentlemen.
yes
sir?
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no
sir
that
is
the
sabine
river.
the
sabine
river,
you
see
the
sabine
river
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
the
pass
is
down
here,
you
see
they
did
not
show
all
of
this
--
one
of
the
things
that
is
unusual.
yet
they
are
trying
to
make
these
lines
on
this
map
but
now
out
in
the
gulf
they
wanted
to
take
another
line.
they
do
not
want
the
same
lines
on
the
maps
out
in
the
gulf.
so
i
mean
it's
kind
of
a
map,
[attempt
to
laughter]
excuse
me.
that's
why
you
see
it's
all
handed
out
like
that
over
here.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
former
governor
and
senator,
daniel
asked
me
to
express
to
you
his
regrets
that
he
could
not
appear
and
argue
this
case.
he
has
been
appointed
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
our
canons
of
judicial
ethics
prevent
him
from
appearing
in
that,
but
he
did
handled
the
case
before
the
special
master.
the
maps
which
are
behind
me,
one
you
have
an
individual
map
which
i
have
had
furnished
to
the
court,
the
large
map
is
furnished
by
mr.
stockwell,
the
counsel
of
louisiana.
i
apologize
to
the
court
that
only
three
of
the
copies
which
should
be
in
justice
marshall,
the
chief
justice
and
justice
blackmun’s
hand,
so
that
all
of
you
can
see
for
reference
purposes.
i
have
all
the
colored
copies
that
the
geological
survey
offers
here
in
washington
had
of
the
map,
the
others
are
reproductions
made
here.
i
will
refer
to
that
map
some
in
the
later
part
of
my
argument.
it’s
a
duplication
of
texas
exhibit
a47.
as
i
understand
the
procedure
that
is
to
be
followed
in
this
case,
there
will
be
no
rebuttal,
even
if
i
wanted
to
save
time
for
it.
so,
i
asked
the
court
to
please
ask
any
questions
that
you
may
have,
concerning
any
arguments
that
mr.
stockwell
has
raised
in
his
brief
in
order
that
i
may
have
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
them
and
i
also,
unless
the
court
have
some
question
about
it,
we
will
pass
over
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
course
and
also
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
united
states
is
a
necessary
party.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
was
the
arrangement
that
we
were
told
by
the
clerk,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
alright.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
am
glad
to
have
the
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no,
i
understand,
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
i
will
do
that.
let
me
commend
judge
wentall,
the
special
master,
not
only
because
i
believe
in
by
far
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
i
understand.
let
me
command
judge
for
his
report
which
in
the
great
part
i
speak
and
support
of.
we
have
one
exception
that
we
took
two
years
report.
really
it
did,
is
more
of
quibble
than
an
exception
almost
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
should
cover
that
last
in
my
argument.
i
particularly
command
judge
wentall
and
command
your
use
the
appendix
of
the
evidence
which
he
has
put
in
the
report
which
is
in
great
detail,
discussing
the
various
individual
exhibits
that
he
considers
to
support
his
findings.
this
is
a
boundary
case
as
you
know
and
it’s
over
the
texas,
louisiana
boundary,
blow
the
32nd
degree
of
north
latitude
which
is
the
boundary
in
the
sabine
river.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
with
one
minor
exception.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
the
32nd
degree
of
north
latitude
is
the
point
at
which
the
sabine
river
ceases
to
be
the
boundary
between
texas
and
louisiana.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
i’ll
discuss
the
specific
language
of
the
boundary
in
a
moment
and
its
significance
to
the
case.
texas
claims
by
grant
from
the
united
states
made
by
act
of
congress
on
july
the
5th
1848
and
also
claims
title
by
prescription
and
equity
assets.
now,
it
should
be
pointed
out
here
i
think,
because
this
does
bear
on
the
point
of
whether
or
not
the
united
states
should
conceivably
be
a
party
in
this
lawsuit.
the
area
which
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit
was
never
a
part
of
the
republic
of
texas
and
is
not
a
part
of
texas'
historic
claim.
we
claim
purely
as
a
grantee
of
the
united
states.
louisiana
claims
by
theory
of
agency
or
osmosis
or
something
to
have
had
prior
title
in
1848
as
a
result
of
the
treaty
of
1819
with
spain,
settling
the
territory
of
boundaries
of
the
united
states
and
spain.
this
treaty
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
louisiana.
to
texas,
the
basic
question
in
the
lawsuit
is
as
between
the
united
states
and
louisiana
on
july
5th
1848
who
had
title
to
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river
including
sabine
lake
and
sabine
pass.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that’s
correct,
at
least
certain
on
it
so
far
is
the
lawsuit
shows,
the
record
in
the
case
shows.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that's
correct,
we
contend
that
congress
never
granted
the
area
in
dispute
to
louisiana
and
the
louisiana
steering
of
the
case
in
addition
to
be
being
wrong
because
the
instruments
just
don’t
grant
it
to
louisiana,
is
constitutionally
wrong
because
article
4
section
3
gives
the
congress
the
exclusive
power
to
dispose
as
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
the
first
senate
to
the
constitution
defines
the
congress
is
consisting
of
the
senate
and
a
house
of
representatives.
and
the
treaty
which
acquired
property
for
the
united
states
is
an
executive
action
right
across
by
the
senate
and
it
cannot
dispose
the
property
to
one
of
the
states
of
the
union.
the
history
of
the
thing
starts
with
the
1803
purchase
of
louisiana
at
a
time,
when
the
westward
claim
of
the
louisiana
purchase
was
completely
unsettled.
jefferson
and
many
other
prominent
people
thought
that
the
claim
extended
clear
to
the
rio
grande.
in
1811,
the
congress
authorized
the
formation
of
the
state
of
louisiana
from
the
orleans
territory.
part
of
the
language,
the
part
of
the
description
relative
to
the
case
is
in
the
special
master's
report
on
page
41.
what
i’m
reading
is
from
the
statutes
at
large,
which
has
a
little
more
in
it
than
the
master
quoted.
it
reads
that
the
inhabitants
of
all
that
part
of
the
territory,
are
country
ceded
under
the
name
of
louisiana
and
then
it
talks
about
the
session
from
france.
contained
within
the
following
limits,
that
is
to
say
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine,
thence
by
land
to
be
drawn
along
the
middle
of
said
river,
including
all
islands
to
the
32nd
degree
of
latitude.
the
louisiana
constitution
of
1812
is
in
virtually
identical
language
except
that
it
inserts
the
word
if
between
all
and
islands
and
the
1812
act
of
admission
by
the
congress,
it
i
believe
in
precisely
the
same
language,
the
if
is
not
in
yet.
now,
the
1812
act
admitting
louisiana
as
a
state
is
also
pertinent
it
seems
to
us
in
another
regard
because
section
3
of
that
act
reads
this
way,
that
the
sub-state,
speaking
of
louisiana,
together
with
the
residue
of
that
portion
of
country
which
was
comprehended
within
the
territory
of
orleans,
as
constituted
by
the
act
entitling
an
act
directing
louisiana
into
two
territories
and
providing
contemporary
governments.
there
shall
be
one
district
and
be
called
the
louisiana
district
and
that
should
the
established
in
the
said
district,
a
district
court
who
consist
of
one
judge.
and
in
the
1850
publication
of
the
statute
at
large
which
is
the
ones,
we
have
down
in
texas,
there
is
one
of
these
little
marginal
squabs
here
that
says,
the
inhabitance
of
louisiana
within
directed
limits,
to
be
authorized
to
form
a
constitution
and
state.
we
contend
that
the
congress
of
course
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing
and
were
acting
within
what
was
the
normal
procedure
of
directing
state
boundary
in
the
middle
of
the
stream,
when
they
defined
louisiana's
eastern
boundary
up
to
the
32nd
degree
of
the
latitude
here
as
being
in
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river.
it
becomes
a
lawsuit
on
a
controversy
because
of
the
1819
treaty
with
spain.
when
that
treaty
was
executed
after
a
considerable
period
of
negotiation,
the
treaty
called
for
the
boundary
between
the
two
countries
to
be
the
western
bank
of
the
sabine,
starting
at
the
westward
mouth
of
the
sabine
and
then
up
to
the
western
bank.
this
treaty
was
ratified
by
mexico
in
1828
by
the
republic
of
texas.
in
1838,
the
boundary
was
actually
surveyed
in
1840-41
by
the
joint
commission
of
the
republic
of
texas
and
the
united
states
and
was
marked
on
the
ground.
and
that
was
the
extent
of
texas'
historic
claim.
in
1845
of
course,
we
had
the
annexation
of
texas
into
the
union
or
its
president
polk
referred
to
it
in
his
inaugural
address,
the
reannexation
of
texas
into
the
union.
now,
we
don't
think
that
there's
anything
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary
about
the
fact
that
the
people
who
were
leaders
in
this
country
in
the
other
part
of
the
last
century,
fully
expected
that
there
will
be
more
states
organized
to
the
westward
of
louisiana,
certainly
president
jackson
and
others
never
ceased
their
efforts,
to
get
texas
and
ultimately
they
did.
the
next
act
of
significance
in
this
controversy
is
important
enough,
that
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
will
read
it
to
you,
it's
on
page
42
of
the
special
master’s
report,
it's
a
resolution
not
by
some
pretty
functionary
of
the
government
of
louisiana,
but
a
solemn
declaration
of
the
louisiana
legislature
passed
in
1848.
it
reads
as
follows.
“whereas
the
constitution
and
the
laws
in
the
state
of
louisiana
nor
those
of
any
other
state
or
territory
extend
over
the
waters
of
the
sabine
river
in
the
middle
of
said
stream
to
the
western
bank
thereof.
and
it
is
of
importance
to
the
citizens
living
contiguous
thereto
and
to
the
people
in
general
that
the
jurisdiction
of
some
state
should
be
extended
over
said
territory
in
order
that
crimes
and
offenses
committed
thereon
should
be
punished
and
wrongs
and
damages
inflicted
should
be
redressed
in
a
speedy
and
convenient
manner.
therefore,
be
it
resolved
by
the
senate
house
of
representatives
of
the
state
of
louisiana
in
general
assembly
convened,
first
that
the
constitution
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
louisiana
shall
be
extended
over
part
of
the
united
states
embraced
in
the
following
limits
(whenever
the
consent
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
be
procured
there
too),
there
is
between
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river
and
the
western
bank
to
begin
at
the
mouth
of
said
river,
where
it
enters
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
thence
to
continue
along
to
the
said
western
bank
to
the
place
where
it
intersects
the
32nd
degree
of
north
latitude,
it
being
the
boundary
line
between
the
said
state
of
louisiana
and
the
state
of
texas.”
counsel
of
louisiana
argued
that
this
is
an
assertion
of
louisiana’s
boundary
to
the
west
bank.
we
argue
the
exact
contrary
that
it
is
an
admission
by
the
louisiana
legislature
that
they
did
not
own
the
west
bank
and
petitioned
to
congress
to
allow
and
to
extend
their
boundaries,
two
only.
texas
passed
a
similar
resolution
in
the
same
month
of
1848
and
sent
it
to
congress.
congress
denied
louisiana’s
petition
and
granted
texas'
petition
and
on
july
05,
1848,
passed
the
act
consenting
to
texas
to
extend
her
boundary
over
the
eastern
half
of
the
sabine
river.
i
would
like
to
read
out
particular
language
because
it
is
relevant
to
an
argument
that
i
make
a
little
further
on.
“be
it
enacted
and
so
forth
that
the
congress
consent
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
to
extend
her
eastern
boundaries,
so
as
to
include
within
her
limits
one-half
of
sabine
pass,
one-half
of
sabine
lake
and
also
one-half
of
the
sabine
river
from
its
mouth
as
far
north
is
a
32nd
degree
of
north
latitude.
now,
the
congress
apparently
realized
full
well,
that
louisiana
did
not
own
this
area
and
that
the
united
states
did
because
on
page
43
of
the
master’s
report
is
quoted
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
own
this
bill
and
then
the
last
paragraph
appearing
on
the
page
says,
mr.
butler
asked
for
the
immediate
consideration
of
the
bill
and
briefly
explained
it's
character.
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
it
was
known
embraced
the
sabine
river
and
lake
to
its
western
shore.
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
louisiana
extended
to
the
middle
of
the
sabine.
so
that
the
half
of
the
river
and
lake
to
the
western
shore
belonged
to
the
united
states
and
was
not
included
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
therefore,
the
boundary
of
the
state
and
that
of
the
united
states
was
not
identical.
the
bill
before
the
senate
gives
the
half
of
the
river
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
louisiana
to
the
state
of
texas
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
later
to
extend
her
criminal
jurisdiction
to
the
louisiana
boundary.
louisiana
has
also
argued
that
all
the
bill
does
is
allow
texas
to
extend
its
criminal
jurisdiction,
but
of
course
it
does
more,
it
allows
them
to
extend
their
boundary,
that
is
the
way
they
are
allowing
them
to
extend
their
criminal
jurisdiction.
and
then
it
concludes
mr.
johnson
of
louisiana
and
mr.
downs
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
louisiana
expressed
the
acquiescence
in
the
arrangement,
which
of
course
were
their
two
senators
at
that
time.
contrary
to
the
statement
in
the
master’s
report
on
page
9
which
i
think
is
in
inadvertence,
the
statement
of
the
second
question
is
the
doctrine
of
acquiescence
in
prescription
applied
to
the
plans
of
either
state
and
if
so,
what
is
his
application
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
louisiana
has
never
pled
nor
claimed
title
by
acquiescence
in
prescription
in
this
lawsuit
and
we
contend
that
on
the
law,
texas
is
entitled
to
judgment
confirming
her
title
in
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river.
turning
to
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
i
am
going
to
talk
about
them
little
later,
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
any
specific
question
you
had
at
this
time
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
texas
claims
that
the
ones
in
the
western
half
by
prescription.
louisiana
does
not
claim
any
islands
by
prescription.
they
claim
as
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
that
is
their
claim
for
the
islands.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that’s
correct,
only
texas
makes
that
claim.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes.
i
suppose
in
a
broad
sense
they
are
and
we
concede
that
a
line
drawn
along
the
middle
of
the
river
when
it
intersects
the
line
would
have
to
go
in
the
western
channel,
so
that
it
would
leave
that
island
on
louisiana’s
side.
but
we
do
not
concede
that
an
island
completely
on
the
western
side
of
the
river
over
and
the
western
half
of
the
river
would
be
louisiana’s
island.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that’s
correct.
even
if
they
were
in
existence
in
1812.
as
a
fact,
the
matter
and
this
is
the
reason
i
have
said
that
our
exception
was
more
equable.
there
are
few
if
any
islands
presently
in
the
river
that
was
there
in
1812.
there
were
very
few
islands
in
the
river
at
all.
now,
even
most
of
the
ones
that
are
shown
on
some
of
these
maps
are
not
there.
we
feel
confident
that
the
ones
we
are
interested
in
at
least
we
could
prove
title
to
that
via
prescription
because
texas
had
used
them
and
may
do
so
for
many
years.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no,
the
treaty
admitting
louisiana
--
i
mean
the
statute
admitting
louisiana
into
the
union
in
1812
provides
for
free
ride
of
navigation
to
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
all
other
states
and
the
treaty
of
1819
with
spain,
if
that
is
of
any
benefit
to
texas
and
there
are
some
questions
where
it
would
be
in
this
context
or
not
and
it
also
provides
for
a
free
navigation
of
the
sabine,
even
though
the
boundary
is
placed
by
that
treaty
on
the
west
bank.
the
special
master
on
the
issue
of
prescription
and
acquiescence
has
detailed
a
great
deal
of
evidence
and
even
what
he
details
is
not
all
of
it.
what
i
am
going
to
briefly
summarize
is
not
all
of
what
he
details
either.
on
maps
that
he
discusses
are
supported
with
his
finding
in
favor
of
texas.
he
discusses
12
mouths
by
texas,
18
by
the
federal
government
and
31
by
louisiana
all
which
recognized
the
mid
boundary.
this
is
a
typical
map.
you'll
notice
down
here
in
the
center
of
the
bottom
that
says
the
sale
by
the
us
geological
survey,
at
denver
and
washington
and
the
state
of
louisiana
department
of
public
works,
bad
moves.
this
is
their
map,
the
federal
government’s
map,
it
is
not
texas'
map.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well,
we
don't
say
that
is
conclusive,
your
honor,
we
just
say
that
it's
notice
to
them
in
their
own
instrument,
but
there
is
a
claim
here
that
in
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river
that
has
existed
for
many,
many
years
and
they
have
done
nothing
about
it.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well,
i
do
not
think
that
when
you
are
talking
about
acquiescence
and
prescription,
you’re
talking
about
the
same
thing
as
an
admission
against
interest
in
the
normal
sense.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no,
no,
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
i
agree
with
you
that
whoever
drew
the
map
could
not
make
an
admission
against
interest,
they
would
be
binding
against
the
state
of
louisiana,
it's
only
an
evidential
fact.
as
to
leases,
there
are
32
texas
sand
and
gravel
and
shore
leases
that
go
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
the
master
refers
to
a
whole
list
of
texas
oil
and
gas
leases
and
some
pipeline
easement.
there
are
32
louisiana
mineral
leases
to
the
middle
of
the
river
and
five
louisiana
pipeline
leads
us
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
both
states
have
closed
parts
of
their
respective
half
of
sabine
lake
to
ouster
dredging
because
of
pollution.
the
federal
rivers
and
harbors
appropriations
made
to
texas
over
the
years
for
use
in
the
sabine
have
been
numerous
which
the
special
master
found
to
be
a
federal
recognition
of
texas'
title.
the
period
1852
to
1913
there
were
61
such
appropriations
and
the
period
1914
to
1969
there
were
40
such
appropriations.
texas
has
participated
with
the
state
of
louisiana
in
erection
of
eight
bridges
across
the
sabine
river
which
were
built
to
and
maintained
to
and
policed
to
the
middle
by
both
states.
taxes
are
assessed
by
both
states
on
pipelines
and
railroad
bridges
across
the
sabine
river
on
the
basis
of
the
division
line
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
this
arrangement
has
been
worked
out
particularly
by
kansas
city
southern
railway
company
which
owned
more
than
one
of
the
bridges
across
the
river
with
the
officials
of
both
states.
police
jurisdiction;
both
states
through
their
highway
patrols
and
their
wildlife
officers,
patrol
to
the
middle
line.
on
the
map,
you
will
note
a
long
sliver
land
right
off
the
port
arthur.
this
is
pleasure
island
which
you
probably
recall
from
the
special
master's
report,
it's
an
area
of
3000
acres
which
has
been
reclaimed
from
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river.
that
reclamation
work
started
in
1911
and
louisiana
has
never
made
one
peep
about
texas
doing
it.
pleasure
island
contains
a
grass
course,
it
contains
a
pleasure
pier
in
marina,
it
contains
the
reserved
army
and
marine
training
station
and
it
contains
a
part
of
amusement
area,
in
addition
to
just
having
land
out
there.
it
also
is
reached
by
a
very
high
span
bridge
under
which
large
freighters
and
tankers
can
sail
with
sufficient
clarity.
port
arthur
is
the
12
port
in
the
united
states
towards
seaport
in
terms
of
tonnage
and
beaumont,
which
also
uses
this
channel
which
is
right
up
the
neches
river
here
out
of
lake
sabine
is
the
eighth
largest
port
in
the
united
states.
together,
i
believe
their
combine
tonnage
makes
them
the
fourth
largest
port
behind
new
york,
new
orleans
and
houston.
the
evidence
of
prescription
as
voluminous
as
it
is,
in
all
of
these
little
acts
is
not
merely
as
strong
as
four
things
which
i
will
now
detail
to
court
which
seem
to
me
to
be
very
strong
on
this
point.
first
of
course
is
the
solemn
declaration
of
the
louisiana
legislature
which
we
read
a
few
moments
ago,
expressly
admitting
that
they
do
not
own
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river.
that
was
followed
by
another
legislative
act
which
the
master's
report
mentions
on
page
106
in
the
form
of
an
appropriation
by
the
louisiana
legislature
in
1857,
a
$15,000
for
improvement
of
the
navigation
of
the
sabine
river
condition
upon
texas
making
a
like
appropriation
for
a
like
purpose.
in
1901
we
have
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
which
has
been
affirmed
three
or
four
times
since,
holding
that
louisiana
did
not
owned
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river
and
could
not
exercise
criminal
jurisdiction
therein.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
somewhat
amusing
and
are
pertinent
i
think.
the
de
soto,
a
parish
louisiana
in
shelby
county
of
texas
both
border
on
the
river.
apparently
gambling
was
illegal
in
shelby
county
of
texas
and
the
retail
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
was
against
the
law
in
the
de
soto
parish,
louisiana.
so
mr.
burton
hit
up
on
the
solution
of
anchoring
his
gambling
establishment
in
louisiana’s
half
of
the
river
and
his
whiskey
establishment
in
the
western
half
of
the
river
and
rigging
up
a
system
of
pulley
ropes
between
them
so
that
you
could
step
on
a
dingy
and
just
pull
yourself
down
the
rope
over
to
the
bar
if
you
wanted
to
and
get
a
drink
and
then
come
back
to
the
gambling
establishment.
the
louisiana
officials
prosecuted
in
for
selling
alcoholic
beverages
at
retail
in
de
soto
parish,
without
a
license
and
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
that
although
this
was
manifestly
an
attempt
to
subvert
the
law,
nevertheless
louisiana
could
not
extend
its
jurisdiction
over
texas
territory
by
the
means
of
a
rope.
and
next
time
he
got
caught
a
year
later,
he
miscalculated
the
mid-river
and
they
put
him
in
jail.
in
1938,
we
have
several
releases,
these
are
discussed
on
page
68
to
69
of
the
master’s
report,
signed
by
the
governor
of
louisiana
which
not
only
call
for
the
middle
of
the
sabine
river,
but
call
for
the
boundary
as
set
by
the
act
of
congress
of
july
5,
1848.
also
in
1938
we
have
an
opinion
issued
by
the
louisiana
attorney
general’s
office,
advising
a
man
in
monroe,
louisiana
is
to
igoe,
i
believe
it
is,
this
is
at
page
69
and
70
of
special
master’s
report,
that
the
louisiana
boundary
was
set
by
act
of
congress
of
april
6,
1812,
that
is
the
act
of
admission
to
find
him
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
the
texas
boundary
by
act
of
congress
of
july
5,
1848.
the
man
had
written
in
and
apparently
he
had
gotten
a
lease
which
purported
to
give
him
all
of
the
river
bottom
and
he
wanted
to
know
whether
he
got
all
or
half
and
the
louisiana
attorney
general
said
he
got
only
half.
so
we
have
the
declaration
by
all
of
three
of
the
department’s
of
government
in
louisiana.
the
legislature
in
1848,
the
supreme
court
at
1901
and
subsequently
and
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
in
1938
all
clearly
recognizing
that
texas
owned
the
western
half
of
the
sabine
river.
in
our
answer
to
all
that
louisiana
alleges
that
three
parishes
purported
to
extend
that
boundary
to
the
west
bank.
i
would
point
out
to
this
that
all
three
of
those
attempts
were
before
the
act
of
congress
of
july
12,
1848
and
from
the
date
of
the
act
of
congress
on
july
12,
1848
until
the
inception
of
the
controversy
with
the
beginning
of
oil
and
gas
activity
in
the
area
about
1940-41,
there
was
a
no
question
of
title.
the
special
master
refers
to
the
desirability
of
having
settled
these
cases
years
ago
and
quotes
of
the
first
justice
harlan's
comment
to
that
effect
in
united
states
versus
texas
in
1895-96,
the
simple
truth
is
that
100
years
ago
there
was
certainly
no
controversy
about
this
plan.
louisiana
also
argues
that
thalweg
should
be
applied,
we
say
that
it
is
not
applicable
in
this
case
for
four
reasons.
number
one,
there
is
no
reason
for
it
where
navigational
rights
are
not
at
issue
and
we
cite
georgia
versus
south
carolina
for
that
proposition.
secondly,
we
say
that
the
prescription
and
acquiescence
establish
a
line
to
the
geographic
center
of
the
sabine
river
and
that
prescription
and
acquiescence
would
overcome
the
thalweg
doctrine
in
any
event.
thirdly,
and
this
is
not
mentioned
by
the
master,
there
is
considerable
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
is
no
thalweg
in
sabine
lake.
the
map
show
a
reasonable
uniform
depth
throughout
the
lake,
there
is
even
one
in
the
record
made
in
1777
that
has
uniform
soundings
throughout
the
lake.
and
fourthly,
and
the
master
emphasized
this,
the
act
of
congress
of
july
5th,
1848
indicated
that
it
was
the
view
of
congress
that
texas
was
together
at
one
half,
one
half,
one
half
not
merely
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
as
to
the
allowance
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
it
shifts
to
some
extent,
but
not
merely
enact
like
the
mississippi
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
as
a
practical
matter
the
geographic
center
would
be
far
easier
to
apply.
in
sabine
lake
for
example
you
would
have
to
go
out
there
and
i
suppose
take
specific
soundings
all
through
the
lake
to
try
to
find
a
channel
through
it,
which
we
don't
believe
would
be
found.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
yes,
on
the
island
question,
we
think
that
the
special
master
only
was
interpreting
the
phrase
including
all
islands
to
refer
to
the
whole
river
rather
than
the
area
of
the
river
defined
by
the
call
for
a
line
to
be
drawn
along
the
middle
of
the
said
river.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
on
this
map,
your
honor
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
alright,
the
sabine
island
after
which
we
recognize
is
in
louisiana.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
the
islands
coming
to
the
west
there,
western
middle
pass
sydney
island
those
are
spoil
banks
and
they
are
not
islands.
(inaudible)
island
is
not
an
island
at
all,
it's
an
area
cut
off
by
the
inter
coastal
canal
of
the
mainland.
the
little
area
there
that
is
called
doom's
island.
there
is
some
controversy
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
in
the
sabine
in
1812
or
not,
it
is
not
there
now,
so
it
probably
doesn't
make
too
much
difference
unless
the
court
should
decide
that
louisiana’s
line
is
entitled
to
be
swung
to
the
west
of
furtherest
island
then
it
might
become
pertinent.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
sydney
island
is
spoil
bank
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
you
see
the
intercoastal
canal
run
drive
there
behind,
it's
spoil,
the
inter
coastal
canal.
in
fact
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
island
controversy
is
not
too
significant
to
the
the
lawsuit
is
because
with
the
possible
exception
of
dooms
island
we
do
not
believe
there
are
any
island
there
that
were
there
in
1812.
the
all
–
oh
my
time
has
expired
i
am
sorry.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
channel
here
is
shown
to
be
12
feet
deep
which
is
the
normal
channel
of
the
inter
coastal
canal.
in
fact
i
feel
sorry
that
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
dispute
about
this,
the
ship
channel
which
comes
out
of
port
aurthur
and
then
goes
going
out
to
the
neches
to
belmont
is
considerably
deeper
that
that
because
it
uses
this
full
size
tankers
and
freighters
all
the
time
and
they
draw
more
than
12
feet,
but
they
do
use
that
area
and
not
sabine
lake.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
there
is
only
one
that
i
know
of
in
a
place
called
the
marrows
and
that
was
decided
by
the
department
of
the
interior
i
believe
in
1910
to
belong
to
louisiana,
that
it
should
be
measured
from
the
western
channel
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
i
would
say
it
is
more
of
a
quibble
really
than
an
exception
about
the
thing.
the
only
thing
that
scares
also
a
little
about
the
islands
is
that
the
the
court
should
determine
as
louisiana
contends
that
the
boundary
should
come
over
here
if
they
can
prove
say
the
dooms
island
existed
in
1812,
and
fix
the
boundary
on
the
west
side
of
dooms
islands
because
dooms
island
actually
is
the
little
beyond
island
in
the
mouth
of
the
neches
river.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
that
gets
us
back
to
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
an
interest
in
it
or
not
and
my
answer
to
that
is
this
your
honor,
it
does
have
an
interest
in
the
starting
point,
yes
as
to
the
boundary
between
louisiana
and
texas.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
where
there
is
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
on
the
west
bank.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
this
does
not
affect
the
united
states,
i
do
think
because
as
to
the
united
states
the
three
league
limit
only
comes
as
far
as
our
historic
boundary.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
the
congress
does
consider
ports
to
extend
it
here
anymore
than
they
have
consented
ports
to
extend
it
up
here
in
north
to
the
32
degree
latitude,
so
we
have
no
controversy.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
it
is
affected
and
most
states
have
stipulated
that
that
issue
is
to
be
excluded
from
this
lawsuit.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
now
it
will
determine
it
obviously
but
this
lawsuit
will
not
determine,
what
tangent
that
line
should
take,
whether
it
should
be
perpendicular
from
the
coast
or
whether
it
should
follow
some
other
line.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well,
we
are
saying,
mr.
justice
that
actually
as
far
as
i
can
understand,
as
far
as
the
records
show,
if
i
wasn't
in
this
in
the
beginning
so
i
certainly
wouldn’t
having
a
first
knowledge
it?
the
world
war
took
place
in
’41
which
we
all
know
about
that
and
then
soon
after
that,
texas
and
louisiana
got
involved
in
the
title
and
litigation
and
from
all
the
information
we
have,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
i
argued
the
matter
before
judge
van
pelt,
i
mentioned
that
fact
that
it
was
not
disputed,
that
there
was
kind
of
a
gentleman’s
understanding
that
neither
side
would
do
anything
pending
the
settlement
of
this
title
and
litigation.
but
texas
settled
and
had
immediately
file
a
suit
and
we
say
that
there
has
been
no
evidence
to
refute
it
although
in
their
brief
they
say
--
they
now
deny
that
but
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
is
exactly
what
--
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
your
honor
because
of
the
fact
that
we
had
put
them
on
notice
and
decided
not
to
do
anything
pending
this
title
end.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
filing
this
very
suit,
texas
asked
us
not
to
bring
in
the
title
ends
issue
on
it
which
like
justice
stewart
said,
we
are
going
to
have
to
settle
someday,
where
the
line
is
going
to
start
and
what
direction
it
is
going
to
take
into
the
gulf.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no
sir,
i
am
not
trying
to
do
that.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
i
do
not
think
they
intend
to
make
this
but
of
course
mr.
justice
marshall,
actually
many
things
are
built
on
fields
in
navigable
streams
without
affecting
the
title
to
the
subsoil.
in
other
words
viewing
in
this
--
if
the
federal
corps
of
engineers
give
port
aurthur
a
right
to
put
these
works
after
that.
that
doesn't
mean
they
would
have
title
to
the
subsoil
on
which
these
field
are
been
made
and
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
we
are
making
in
here.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
we
take
to
position,
justice
marshall
that
it
was
–
in
the
interest
of
both
parties,
this
was
a
navigable
stream.
both
parties
wanted
to
have
commerce
across
it.
now,
the
testimony
would
show
that
these
bridges
were
loaned
to
one
point
into
river,
they
were
in
half
and
half
all
the
way
across.
in
other
words
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no
sir
but
we,
some
of
our
people
testified
they
did
arrest
all
the
way
across,
i
would
say
that
most
haven’t
recognized
the
division
line,
i
mean
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
the
court.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
it
was
along
somewhere
in
there,
they
were
thinking
about
it
from
their
jurisdiction
but
i
think
as
far
as
the
bridges
were
concerned,
they
were
built
maybe
on
a
50-50
basis
and
they
owned
the
whole
bridge
together
and
i
think
you
would
see
from
the
testimony
there
were
not
any
line
picked
out
in
any
part
of
the
river.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
i
would
agree
generally
with
that
premise,
your
honor
but
i
feel
if
the
parties
mutually
understand,
that
they
have
got
another
matter
to
settle
and
they
are
not
going
to
litigate
over
it,
then
i
think
that
is
another
matter.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
i
think
it
would
have
it
then
because
states
really
act
a
little
different
than
the
individuals.
i
mean
i
think
that
it
is
harder
to
get
them
to
get
into
lawsuits
with
each
other,
in
particular
for
any
state.
i
mean
i
think
that
is
a
matter
that
certainly,
i
do
not
think
if
you
would
--
but
we
say
that
beyond
that,
that
they
agree
that
they
would
not
litigate
this
pending
this
title
end
litigation
which
is
evidently
in
this
very
case
because
we
are
not
litigating
the
part
that
extends
into
the
gulf.
now
your
honor
we
fell
that
the
question
of
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
we
do
not
make
that
as
a
reference
to
one
state,
one
state
to
another
state.
now
we
would
make
it
as
the
individuals.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
it
could
acquire
title
by
acquiescence
and
prescription,
i
mean
settle
the
boundaries.
so
i
want
to
accept
what
this
court
said
on
it,
that
as
far
as
between
the
states
that
you
would
not,
in
other
words,
we
could
not
say
prescription
would
run
against
louisiana
in
favor
of
texas
or
vice
versa.
so
i
would
think
if
it
is
an
individual,
there
would
be
a
different
problem.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
texas
had
this
very
same
problem
in
one
of
that,
in
the
mexican
boundary.
in
the
case
of
fergosa
(ph),
they
had
a
treaty
in
1905
in
which
they
settled
some
bancos
as
they
call
it
which
is
made
by
the
rio
grande
river.
now
part
of
these
bancos
were
taken
from
mexico
and
given
to
united
states
in
part
to
mexico.
now
the
question
came
up
in
this
case
as
whether
or
not
a
party
acquired
a
title
to
one
of
these
bancos
by
limitation.
and
the
only
way
he
could
acquire
that
title
was
if
texas
got
title
to
this
banco
by
virtue
of
the
treaty
and
not
by
virtue
of
some
acts
that
was
passed
in
1823
--
1923
and
the
court
held
that
when
the
united
states
and
mexico
settle
this
boundary,
that
those
lands
merely
became
part
of
texas
and
it
didn’t
need
any
further
action.
they
said
texas
had
given
up
some
land
and
they
acquired
some
land
and
that
is
the
same
thing
as
louisiana
has
done
here.
the
question
(inaudible)
we
say
that
(inaudible)
louisiana
is
in
this
position,
this
is
an
alternative
plea,
if
the
court
feel
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
it.
this
court
is
held
into
the
case
of
the
state
of
louisiana
versus
mississippi
that
the
thalweg
applied
to
the
east
boundary
of
louisiana
in
the
pearl
river
and
extending
all
down
into
the
gulf
interpreting
the
same
language
and
the
constitution
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
the
middle
of
the
sabine,
the
middle
of
the
pearl
and
the
question
they
both
have
arrived
at
navigation
and
of
course
we
feel
that
certainly,
this
court,
in
making
other
cases
dealing
with
navigable
streams
where
you
have
equal
rights
of
navigation
have
always
held
that
the
thalweg
applied.
now
the
case
of
georgia
versus
north
carolina
is
kind
of
an
unusual
case
and
we
do
not
believe
that
that
was
more
or
less,
the
parties
more
or
less
admitted
themselves
in
that
kind
of
a
position
but
we
feel
that
the
majority
of
the
jurisprudence
in
particular
interpret
their
own
constitution.
this
court
has
held
but
the
thalweg
rule
would
apply
if
you
feel
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
the
west
bank
boundary.
now
as
far
as
orleans,
i
want
to
make
a
quick
reference
to
that.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
it
made
quite
a
little—
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
well
your
honor
it
makes
a
good
deal
of
difference
as
to
how
they
come
out
of
the
sabine,
at
the
sabine
pass.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
can
see
they
have
done
a
lot
of
channel
work
in
here.
now
the
question
is
what
do
we
entitle
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
are
we
entitled
in
1848?
see
it
was
about
four
part
orleans
up
here
and
the
channel
came
out,
in
other
words
when
they
made
the
survey
in
1840-1841,
they
made
it
on
the
west
bank
of
the
furtherest
island
so
we
say
that
it
would
make
a
lot
of
difference
in
coming
out
of
here.
now
in
that
survey,
they
also
found
what
they
called
doom’s
island
right
of
the
neches.
that
was
in
the
survey
and
referred
to
it.
they
made
--
in
other
words
they
made
notes
of
all
of
the
surveys
so
they
referred
to
that.
now
if
you
follow
the
case
of
south
carolina
and
georgia,
then
the
court,
if
the
language
of
that
case
would
be
accepted,
would
take
the
channel
west
of
these
islands,
that
is
what
they
did
in
that
case.
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
that
is
right.
so
--
and
then
they
all
hound
up
the
river
by
the
two.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
kind
of
unusual,
your
honors
because
texas,
in
their
motion
for
judgment
and
memorandum
with
respect
to
the
motion,
on
page
nine,
they
admitted
this,
they
say
that
congress
permitted
louisiana
to
include
within
its
state
boundary
all
of
the
eastern
half
of
the
sabine
including
all
islands
within
the
stream.
so
we
say
that
they
only
changed
their
position
later
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
letter
from
mr.
gouge
that
urged
the
same
thing.
in
other
words,
he
urged
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
west
half,
exclusion
of
all
the
islands.
so,
texas
in
its
own
brief,
and
they
already
stated
in
this
case,
they
admitted
louisiana
was
entitled
to
all
of
the
islands
in
the
sabine.
so
we
say
this
is
important
to
be
considered
by
the
court
to
consider
in
this
case.
i
certainly
thank
you
gentlemen.
yes
sir?
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
no
sir
that
is
the
sabine
river.
the
sabine
river,
you
see
the
sabine
river
--
mr.
samuel
d.
mcdaniel
the
pass
is
down
here,
you
see
they
did
not
show
all
of
this
--
one
of
the
things
that
is
unusual.
yet
they
are
trying
to
make
these
lines
on
this
map
but
now
out
in
the
gulf
they
wanted
to
take
another
line.
they
do
not
want
the
same
lines
on
the
maps
out
in
the
gulf.
so
i
mean
it's
kind
of
a
map,
[attempt
to
laughter]
excuse
me.
that's
why
you
see
it's
all
handed
out
like
that
over
here.
thank
you.
