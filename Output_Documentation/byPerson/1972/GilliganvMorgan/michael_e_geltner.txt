mr.
michael
e.
geltner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
before
i
go
into
my
argument,
i
just
like
to
clarify
two
points
which
came
up
in
the
proceeding
arguments
and
that
--
which
i
might
be
able
to
clear
the
record.
the
first
is
the
claim
for
declaratory
relief.
since
on
the
drafting
of
the
complaint,
i
guess,
i
got
to
stand
by
it,
in
subparts
--
i’m
reading
from
page
11
of
the
appendix,
in
subparts
b,
c,
and
d
on
page
11
of
the
prayer
for
relief.
after
requesting
injunctive
relief,
the
paragraph
then
proceeds
to,
recite
the
words,
and
declaring
the
use
of
the
ohio
national
guard
troops
contrary
to
those
requirements
to
be
unlawful.
it
is
that
portion
which
is
intended
to
be
the
request
for
declaratory
as
well
as
injunctive
relief.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
have
not
learned
in
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
you
might.
yes,
your
honor.
you
might
as
to
some
aspects.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
you
would
not,
but
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that’s
right,
your
honor.
it
was
our
--
it
was
anticipated
that
the
injunctive
aspect
of
the
relief,
if
gotten,
need
not
simply
be
a
recital.
the
past
events
being
wrong
and
enjoining
future
events,
rather
it
might
be
directed
at
specific
items.
for
example,
specifically
ordering
the
guard
no
longer
to
carry
loaded
weapons,
into
engagement.
it
was
believed
that
in
that
certain
aspects
to
the
injunction
could
be
specific
whereas
certain
aspects
of
the
declaratory
judgment
might
be
more
general
in
terms.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
it
was
anticipated,
so
that
was
the
request.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
among
the
possible,
appropriately
some
might
be
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
the
rules
of
engagement
in
ohio
were
highly
objectionable.
it
was
anticipated
that
we
would
seek
either
a
specific
order
directed
at
specific
items,
or
that
the
court
would
order
the
defendants
in
the
event
that
it
found
wrongdoing,
to
come
forward
with
a
plan
for
ratification
of
the
conditions
and
then
into
the
plan.
as
part
of
its
order,
if
it
found
the
plan
to
be
adequate,
it
was
anticipated
in
court
that
it
might
well
be
the
army’s
rules
of
engagement
or
those
noted
by
judge
edmund
in
his
opinion
below.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
there
are
numerous
alternatives,
but
at
this
point,
the
rules
which
are
present
in
the
appendices
produced
by
the
army
are
sufficient,
but
we
believe
that
they
deal
only
with
a
certain
aspect
of
the
case.
and
in
addition,
that
may
will
be
necessary
to
have
them
entered
as
an
order
at
this
time
for
that
specific
purpose.
what
we
believe
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
maintain
the
existing
army
rules
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
would
satisfy
us
as
to
the
bulk
of
our
case,
but
we
perceive
a
substantial
difference
between
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
rules
are
in
force
and
the
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
rules
are
actually
enforced,
and
enforced
over
a
continuous
period
of
time
by
adequate
training
of
the
troops,
by
continuous
training
of
the
troops.
ohio,
prior
to
the
time
in
question,
did
not
have
these
rules.
ohio
might
well
go
back
to
its
old
rules
in
the
future.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
ohio
has
made
an
irrevocable
decision
for
these
rules.
the
rules
are
not
law,
they
are
not
law
in
ohio,
and
they
are
not
law
in
united
states.
in
addition
to
which
as
i
have
said,
it
is
basically
a
district
court
function
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
language
of
the
rules
is
actually
conveyed
to
the
troops
by
instruction
and
by
order.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
i
suppose
we
could.
it’s
taken
us
over
two
years
now
to
have
an
adjudication
and
we
still
have
not
yet
had
a
district
court
entering
order
or
decide.
i
would
assume
that
what
with
the
complicated
procedural
problems
involved
in
a
prospective
course
of
action
directed
against
the
government.
the
district
court
might
well
see
dismissal
as
a
logical
way
to
act.
it’s
important
i
believe
to
have
these
questions
decided
now,
assuming
as
you
say,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
proper
case,
is
justiciable
and
the
courts
do
have
standing.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
three
plaintiffs
have
all
graduated.
the
action
was
brought
as
a
class
action
at
the
time
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
entire
class
--
the
kent
state
university
student
body
is
the
class
represented.
none
of
the
three
named
plaintiffs
are
now
members
of
the
kent
student
body.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
have
not
sought,
but
we’ll
seek
at
the
district
court
level.
we
have
been
requested
by
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
believe
at
this
point,
the
complaint
stands
on
itself.
at
the
appropriate
time,
the
district
court
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
see
no
provision
in
the
rules
for
substituting
at
this
point.
the
district
court
can
substitute
and
we
have
been
requested
by
the
president
--
the
present
president
for
the
student
body
to
intervene
him
when
we
have
the
opportunity.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
have
not
asked
this
court
for
an
order.
as
i
said,
it
is
our
plan
to
seek
substitution
at
the
district
court
level
and
i
believe
that
the
cases
support
the
proposition
and
that’s
the
appropriate
place.
rule
25
speaks
to
substituting
defendants
at
any
stage
rather
than
substituting
plaintiffs
in
any
stage
or
proceedings.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor,
i
have
a
rather
lengthy
answer
for
that
question
because
it
requires
an
exploration
of
the
entire
standing
doctrine.
basically,
this
case
is
a
live
justiciable
case
because
of
the
specific
events.
the
complaint
alleges
and
we
believe
we
can
prove
that
there
were
specific
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights.
there
were
people
killed,
there
were
people
shot,
there
were
beatings
administered,
there
were
detentions,
there
were
lawful
assemblies
broken
up.
we
believe
we
can
prove
all
of
that
and
we’ve
alleged
to
all
of
that.
there's
been
a
specific
concrete
controversy.
it’s
an
event
which
was
explored
at
great
length
by
numerous
commissions,
but
we
believe
it’s
highly
justiciable
in
nature,
in
that,
it
relates
to
specific
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
government
in
the
past.
now,
the
key,
the
key
to
the
prospective
aspect
of
the
case
is
this
specific
wrongdoing.
it’s
in
that
sense
that
this
case
is
different
from
several
of
the
cases
in
recent
years
in
which
the
court
has
found
no
standing
because
of
an
absence
of
a
past
event.
that
is
we
are
not
seeking
merely
guidance
for
the
future;
we
are
seeking
guidance
for
the
future
arising
out
of
a
specific
event.
the
next
question
is,
what
is
the
nexus
as
to
these
particular
plaintiffs
to
this
past
event.
the
answer
to
that
is
complex.
but
basically,
the
past
event
forms
the
factual
basis
out
of
which
we
conclude
in
the
complaint
that
very
real
risk
exist
of
repetition
in
the
event
of
future
demonstrations,
future
lawful
assemblies.
the
plaintiffs
are
as
exposed
to
that
as
any
other
person
on
the
kent
state
university
campus,
but
students
at
kent
state
university
campus
at
the
time
of
the
filing
to
this
complain,
were
peculiarly
exposed
to
that
risk
because
of
what
had
happened
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
relationship
of
the
local
police
and
the
national
guard
to
that
community.
it
was
therefore
felt
and
it
is
still
felt
that
they
are
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
same
kind
of
conduct
and
that
the
factual
basis
on
which
a
court
can
act
has
got
to
be
this
past
conduct
in
which
we
seek
to
prove
that
certain
things
were
done
as
alleged
and
were
results
of
the
inadequacies
which
we
alleged
to
have
led
to
them.
that
is
what
makes
it
a
specific
controversy
as
opposed
to
a
law
suit
in
which
a
plaintiff
walks
into
the
court
and
says,
“i
hear
the
government
is
doing
something,
i
think
it
may
affect
me.
therefore,
i’d
like
to
bring
an
action.”
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
this
is
a
very
specific
background.
there
was
a
very
specific
conduct
and
it
is
very
specific
conduct
that
we
are
aiming
at.
it
is
only
at
kent
state
university
student
who
is
subjected
to
this
risk.
by
the
same
token
though,
a
kent
state
university
student
is
as
much
exposed
to
these
particular
risks
in
the
future
and
was
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
as
people
who
were
actually
been
subjected.
now,
we’ve
complained
about
a
bunch
of
diverse
constitutional
deprivations,
one
of
which
is
shooting.
now,
it
is
hard
to
see
for
the
purposes
of
prospective
relief,
why
the
court
would
want
to
require
somebody
who
was
actually
shot
to
be
the
plaintiff,
when
the
key
of
prospective
relief
is
preventing
future
shootings.
we
say
similar
things
about
beatings
and
about
detentions.
now,
as
to
the
breakup
of
lawful
assemblies,
the
complaint
does
not
allege
that
these
plaintiffs
were
participating
in
the
assemblies
which
were
broken
up.
now,
as
to
that
we
believe
the
complaint
does
not
preclude
us
from
proving
that
they
were
in
fact
participants
in
those
lawful
assemblies.
in
fact,
we
read
the
rule
of
conley
versus
gibson
as
holding
that
unless
your
complaint
establishes
that
your
are
not
in
fact
capable
of
proving
that
which
entitles
you
to
relief,
then
you
may
not
be
dismissed.
we
think
that
the
question
of
this
entitlement
as
to
that
item
is
properly
a
defensive
matter
or
a
matter
for
a
single
judgment.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that’s
right
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
theory
of
inadequate
training,
the
theory
of
improper
orders,
the
theory
of
improper
arming
of
the
troops.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
i
don’t
think
your
honor,
that
that
question
can
be
avoided.
what
happened
in
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
dismissed
without
an
opinion.
as
a
result
we
have
really
no
guidance
as
to
what
his
thinking
was.
judge
edwards
wrote
the
controlling
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
for
the
panel
of
the
sixth
circuit.
judge
edwards
split
the
complaint
in
three
parts,
properly
so.
one
part
of
the
complaint
deals
with
the
claim
that
a
section
of
ohio
law
which
the
national
guard
had
read
as
giving
it
an
immunity
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
judge
edwards
construed
that
narrowly
and
dismissed
it.
the
other
claim
deals
with
the
power
of
the
court
to
enjoin
the
governor
of
ohio
from
future
use
of
the
national
guard
prematurely.
judge
edwards
dismissed
that
on
the
ground
that
it
was
in
effect
a
prior
restraint
and
not
justified.
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
the
reasons
why
certiorari
was
not
filed
on
that,
which
leaves
the
rest
of
the
complaint
which
judge
edwards
ordered
to
dismiss
and
he
quotes
in
his
opinion
from
the
relevant
paragraphs
which
he
concludes,
stated
the
cause
of
action.
i
am
reading
now
from
page
15
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
contains
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
the
allegations
are
the
portion
of
the
complaint
which
he
find
subject
to
remand
are
subparts
a,
b,
c,
and
d
of
the
controlling
paragraph
describing
the
wrongs.
those
are
the
ones
which
describe
the
separate
wrongs,
which
are
an
issue
and
as
i
have
said
they
are
basically
the
shootings,
the
beatings,
the
detentions
without
arrest
and
the
breakup
of
assemblies
which
we
allege.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
accept
that
as
one
of
the
four
substantive
questions
which
i
believe
his
remand
puts
an
issue
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
one
of
the
four,
his
statement
of
that
portion
of
the
complaint
which
deals
with
the
unjustifiable
killings
and
shootings
is
perfectly
adequate
and
i
fully
accept
that
statement.
the
other
sub-paragraphs
of
the
complaint
which
he
had
just
quoted
from
include
cause
of
unlawful
and
unjustified
beatings,
unlawful
detentions,
and
breakup
of
lawful
and
peaceable
assemblies.
in
each
of
those
instances,
judge
edwards
in
his
opinion
italicized
the
key
language.
when
he
came
to
framing
the
question,
he
framed
only
the
question
as
it
related
to
the
shootings,
that
is
the
use
of
lethal
force
with
non-lethal
force
was
reasonably
necessary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
seems
to
me
he
has
remanded
all
the
questions
because
he
goes
onto
hold,
that
relief
is
appropriate
as
to
that
--
those
portions
of
the
complaint
that
key
question
in
part
is
the
entitlement
of
one
to
have
a
judicial
forum,
here
one's
claim
for
relief
and
that
those
aspects
of
the
complaint
are
distinguishable
from
those
portions
which
he
split
off
dealt
with
separate
land
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
that
your
honor,
fairly
read
the
complaint
raises
three
questions
which
are
admittedly
lesses
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
four
in
all.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
are
subsidiary
to
that
matter
and
that
maybe
dealt
with
independently.
now,
judge
edwards
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
your
honor,
it
may
well
be
that
judge
edwards
saw
those
matters
as
a
subsidiary
to
the
question
of
the
actual
use
of
deadly
weapons.
in
the
proposal
that
he
sets
forward
his
appendix
to
his
opinion,
he
deals
with
matters
which
relate
to
much
more
than
merely
the
use
of
deadly
force.
he
deals
with
the
futons,
he
deals
with
the
vein
which
a
mob
have
to
be
engaged
etcetera.
it's
possible
to
see
the
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
national
guard
is
authorized
to
detain
people,
to
beat
people
and
more
specifically
to
breakup
assemblies
as
subsidiary
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
way
in
which
it
conducts
itself
is
integral
to
an
unreasonable
risk
creation
as
to
death
or
shooting.
it
is
possible
to
see
the
most
subsidiary.
it
is
also
possible
to
see
the
most
separable.
it
is
our
position
that
the
complaint
should
fairly
be
read
as
treating
them
as
separable,
although
i
understand
that
judge
edwards’
opinion
tends
to
see
them
as
subsidiary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
court
issues
an
order
thereafter
the
--
the
order
enjoins
the
defendants
from
ordering
them
for
beating
their
troops
to
breakup
lawful
and
peaceable
assemblies.
thereafter,
the
defendant
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
not
for
purposes
of
a
contempt
power
of
the
court
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
for
example
that
the
defendant
did
in
fact
breakup
at
least
two
lawful
and
peaceable
assemblies.
i
know
of
no
mechanism
other
than
the
contempt
power
of
the
united
states
district
court
which
would
give
any
of
the
plaintiffs
or
their
representatives,
you
are
willing
to
call
the
defendants
to
task
for
that.
it
is
our
belief
that
the
injunction
is
necessary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
on
the
ground
your
honor
that
they
have
in
fact
broken
up
lawful
assemblies
in
the
past,
that
is
acted
unlawfully.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
hague
versus
c.i.o.
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
which
incorporated
in
part
the
opinion
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
there
were
four
opinions
in
the
court
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
my
recollection
is
that
at
one
point
of
my
brief,
i
have
traced
down
the
--
i
have
got
in
the
footnote
here,
haven’t
i?
i
see
six
votes
on
the
court
for
the
proposition
that
the
assembly
--
that
the
breakup
of
an
unlawful
assembly
is
a
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right
and
that
a
court
may
act
in
its
equity
jurisdictions
to
enjoin
that
future
conduct.
and
if
i
can
find
the
appropriate
page,
justice
roberts
for
himself
and
justice
black,
and
justice
stone
for
himself
and
justice
reed
and
chief
justice
hughes,
five
votes,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
justice
douglas
and
justice
frankfurter
did
not
participate
and
i
guess
that
leaves
us
with
three
dissenters.
so,
i
see
five,
five
votes,
two
dissenters.
i
see
five
votes
for
their
proposition
all
of
whom
were
agreed,
although
i
recognize
that
justice
stone
got
there
a
different
way
and
that's
the
basis
for
our
proposition.
thereafter
of
course,
the
district
courts
and
the
circuit
courts
have
expended
to
a
great
extent
on
that
power.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
i
can
grant
you
one
rock,
your
honor,
which
will
mean
a
crime.
that
would
not
be
a
right
under
ohio
law
that
would
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
constitution
does
not
protect
an
assembly
in
which
rocks
or
a
rock
are
thrown.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that’s
right.
i
am
willing
to
accept
that
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
you
have
changed
the
facts
on
me.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
we
do
not
want
that
law,
but
the
fact
--
the
question
is
may
the
assembly
be
broken
up
as
a
consequence
of
one
act
to
violence.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
question,
i
think
it
can
be,
but
the
other
side
of
the
question
is
may
the
assembly
be
broken
up
as
a
result
of
no
acts
of
violence,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
one
is
got
to
be
no.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
exactly,
it
is
truly
a
factual
point.
it
is
likewise
true
that
we
allege
as
a
factual
matter
that
defendants
did
breakup
a
lawful
assembly
and
we
plan
to
prove
that
the
assemblies
were
in
fact
wholly
lawful
and
wholly
peaceful
at
the
time
of
the
national
guard
acted
to
break
them
up.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
conditions
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
particular
assembly?
other
assemblies
have
occurred.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
is
not
in
the
records,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
occurred
after
the
day
of
the
complaint
your
honor.
it
is
not
lawful,
it
is
--
i
have
taken
a
position
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
class
as
of
now
consists
of
all
students
of
kent
state
university.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
which
consists
of
different
persons
from
when
it
was
filed.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
different
persons,
same
class.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
is
in
the
nature
of
the
class.
the
key
through
the
class
action
under
rule
23
(b)2
is
prospective
relief.
is
it
likely
that
defendants
will
act
toward
the
entire
class
in
a
way
such
as
to
justify
prospective
relief.
that
is
the
key
to
the
whole
complaint,
but
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
we're
in
difficult
position
here
because
the
fact
that
all
we
have
got
is
a
bad
complaint.
it
would
be
much
preferable,
if
we
had
a
record
to
deal
with,
but
we
do
not,
and
therefore
all
we
got
to
do
is
deal
with
influences.
now,
we
have
--
we're
willing
to
rest
on
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
now.
i
think
it
is
terribly
proper
for
me
to
come
here
and
try
to
tell
the
court
that
we
can
prove
things
which
are
beyond
the
face
of
the
complaint.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
is
contrary
point.
we
believe
--
we
believe
first
of
all
as
a
matter
of
law
that
because
of
the
wrong
doing,
because
of
the
very
specific
acts
even
if
these
regulations
are
legitimate,
they
should
be
entered
as
an
order
and
an
order
or
declaratory
judgment
should
be
entered
so
as
to
preclude
any
return
to
the
old
ways.
in
that
sense,
the
controversy
is
not
mooted.
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
would
go
very
far
to
satisfying
us.
the
other
aspect
of
a
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that’s
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
standing
justiciability,
the
absence
of
mootness
are
pre-requisites
to
this
court's
acting
or
continuation
and
the
actual
about
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
is
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
district
court
has
got
to
enter
an
order.
thereafter
the
district
court
has
got
to
make
itself
available
for
a
counsel
to
bring
to
its
attention
any
matters
including
the
counsel
for
the
defendants
in
the
event
that
they
seek
to
modify
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
i
believe
that
counsel
can
be
authorized
to
marshal
periodically
the
nature
of
the
training
and
to
make
available
to
the
court
whatever
evidence
is
necessary.
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
could
be
done
by
access.
it
could
be
done
by
permitting
counsel
to
come
forward
and
produce
witnesses.
a
motion
for
contempt
is
ordinarily
subject
to
proof
before
the
court
or
motion
for
modification
can
be
some
of
the
subjects.
courts
have
traditionally
and
increasingly
over
the
last
few
years
given
injunctive
relief
which
requires
the
injunction
to
be
administered.
it
has
been
done
in
bankruptcy
practice
for
many
years,
several
of
the
circuit
courts
in
the
last
few
years
have
upheld
the
issuance
of
relatively
broad
decrees
dealing
with
the
conduct
of
prisons
and
the
conduct
of
other
administrative
functions
to
the
state.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
the
court
could
send
a
master,
the
court
could
authorize
the
attorneys
or
their
representatives
to
appear
and
observe.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
might
be
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
would
not
be
required,
it
would
be
one
of
the
ways
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
all
i
can
say
your
honor,
is
that
that
over
the
past
few
years,
i
have
to
come
to
know
an
awful
lot
about
what
the
ohio
national
guard
is
doing
on
a
relatively
ongoing
basis
as
a
result
of
the
availability
of
witnesses.
it
is
not
the
cia,
it
is
not
a
secret
organization.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
its
people
are
part
time
soldiers,
they
are
soldiers
on
weekends,
or
for
a
couple
of
weeks
during
the
summer
doing
the
rest
of
the
time,
that's
not
any
(inaudible)
secrecy.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
believe
that
we
can
produce
expert
witnesses
testify
as
to
the
training
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
adequate.
where
upon
the
court
can
become
convinced
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
or
there
is
not
adequate
training.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
personally
am
not
an
expert.
we
have
consulted
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
district
court
can
be
made
an
expert
to
the
extent
that
there
is
not
any
other
(inaudible)
to
produce
witnesses.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
courts
hear
medical
witnesses,
medical
expert
witnesses
on
a
daily
basis.
district
judges
have
decide
practice
cases
involving
complicated
problems
of
organic
chemistry,
without
having
taken
the
chemistry
course
in
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
a
very
substantial
interference
with
the
national
guard
conduct.
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
we
have
alleged
and
hope
to
prove
that
the
national
guard
in
ohio
has
been
responsible
for
some
very
serious
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights.
we
believe
that
in
that
context
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
some
of
them
have.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
the
unit
remains
the
same.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
particular
defendants
have
been
changed,
but
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
if
you
want
me
to
go
beyond
the
record
your
honor,
the
answer
is
that
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
do
i
know
for
fact?
i
have
some
evidences
to
indicate
that
the
quality
of
training
as
to
these
matters
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor,
it's
absolutely
right.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
you
asked
me
the
question
your
honor,
i
feel
very
uncomfortable
going
beyond
the
record.
the
fact
of
the
matter
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
i
believe
as
a
district
judge
has
followed,
i
mean
there
is
just
--
it
is
a
--
you
can't
criticize
the
defendant
from
making
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
rules
authorize
the
defendant.
you
can't
criticize
the
district
judge
for
improperly
granting
a
motion
to
dismiss.
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
a
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor
and
this
i
don't
believe
is
one
of
them
at
the
time
this
complaint
was
filed.
it
has
stated
a
good
cause
of
action.
i
believe
that
to
this
day
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
it
states
a
good
cause
of
action.
if
these
case
were
remanded
and
a
factual
record
made,
then
this
court
would
have
before
it
questions
of
the
adequacy
of
the
training,
questions
which
relate
to
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs,
specifically
a
factual
record
on
the
question
of
eminence.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
is
right,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
the
question
of
mootness,
as
the
court
framed
the
issue
of
mootness
in
the
wt
grant
case,
there
are
really
two
senses
in
which
a
case
can
become
moot.
the
first
sense
is
a
pure
outright
change
of
law,
hall
versus
beals
is
an
example
of
that
kind
of
case
in
which
the
court
concluded
the
law
had
changed
and
therefore
the
controversy
no
longer
existed.
the
second
situation
is
a
situation
in
which
the
claimant
has
put
forth
that
that
which
was
highly
likely
at
a
proceeding
time
is
no
longer
highly
likely
because
of
a
change
in
circumstances.
that
is
a
factual
issue.
it
is
an
issue
to
be
set
decided
by
a
district
judge.
the
district
judge
as
we
all
know
has
discretion
in
granting
injunctive
relief
and
it
can
very
well
deny
injunctive
relief
on
the
ground
that
while
he
has
found
wrong
doing,
he
now
finds
that
the
circumstances
are
not
such
as
to
warrant
the
entering
even
injunction.
that's
a
district
judge’s
function.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
what
we
are
seeking
at
this
point.
understanding
that
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
we
were
seeking
a
more
specific
change
in
what
then
existed.
your
honor,
there
is
one
further
point
which
has
come
up
on
couple
of
occasions
and
i
have
never
really
specifically
addressed
myself
to
and
that
is
the
relationship
of
laird
versus
tatum
to
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
has
gone
to
some
length
to
demonstrate
the
way
in
which
this
case
is
like
laird.
we
think
this
case
is
different
from
laird
in
several
respects.
laird
was
basically
a
case
in
which
the
conduct
of
the
defendants
were
not
itself
unlawful
and
did
not
in
itself
involve
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right,
but
it
was
alleged
that
the
chilling
effect
of
the
defendants’
conduct
created
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
right.
so,
what
it
was,
it
was
an
attempt
to
bootstrap
from
an
injury
into
a
deprivation
of
a
right.
now,
irrespective
of
what
i
personally
may
think
about
that
in
the
privacy
area,
this
case
is
crucially
different.
first
of
all,
it
is
different
in
the
sense
that
the
people
that
are
subjected
to
the
kinds
of
injuries
that
occurred
here
and
which
we
see
as
possibly
appearing
in
the
future
or
the
opposite
of
the
people
who
were
going
to
be
chilled,
they
are
the
people
who
actually
participate
in
the
assemblies
and
so
we
believe
that
that
first
of
all
chilling
effect
as
to
these
people
is
really
not
pertinent
to
the
question
of
injury
here
or
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
complaint
states
a
wrong.
that's
the
first
different
the
way
in
which
the
case
is
different
from
laird.
the
second
way,
in
which
the
case
is
different
from
laird
lies
in
the
fact
that
this
case
alleges
an
injury
which
is
very
specific
in
nature
and
which
has
been
held
by
preceding
cases
to
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
deprivation.
that
is
one
who
is
unjustifiably
killed
by
government
action
is
in
fact
subjected
to
a
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right.
so,
that
the
inquiry
into
the
defendants’
conduct
stems
from
a
specific
constitutional
right
as
opposed
to
the
laird
case
in
which
there
is
no
specific
constitutional
right,
but
the
subject,
the
feeling
of
injury
is
said
to
be
enough
to
lead
to
the
finding
of
a
constitutional
deprivation.
i
think
that
is
a
very
substantial
difference.
there
is
one
further
aspect
of
laird
which
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
and
that
is
the
assumption
that
the
assumption
present
in
this
case
which
we
have
come
to
on
a
couple
of
our
occasions
that
the
nature
of
the
training
will
be
adequate
to
assure
that
the
new
rules
of
engagement
are
in
fact
more
forth
to
choose.
we
have
heard
a
good
deal
on
the
way
of
assurances
from
the
defendants,
there
is
more
on
the
briefs
and
what
we
see
in
laird
about
this
is
that
exactly,
very
similar
kinds
of
assurances
were
made
to
the
court
at
that
time.
specifically,
there
are
assurances
with
respect
to
the
retention
of
documents
etcetera.
it
was
then
found
by
a
senate
committee
that
documents
had
not
in
fact
been
retained.
we
believe
that
all
of
these
matters,
matters
with
respect
to
what
the
orders
are
and
how
they
are
implemented
are
purely
matters
of
proof
and
therefore
specifically
functions
for
a
district
rather
than
in
appellate
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
before
i
go
into
my
argument,
i
just
like
to
clarify
two
points
which
came
up
in
the
proceeding
arguments
and
that
--
which
i
might
be
able
to
clear
the
record.
the
first
is
the
claim
for
declaratory
relief.
since
on
the
drafting
of
the
complaint,
i
guess,
i
got
to
stand
by
it,
in
subparts
--
i’m
reading
from
page
11
of
the
appendix,
in
subparts
b,
c,
and
d
on
page
11
of
the
prayer
for
relief.
after
requesting
injunctive
relief,
the
paragraph
then
proceeds
to,
recite
the
words,
and
declaring
the
use
of
the
ohio
national
guard
troops
contrary
to
those
requirements
to
be
unlawful.
it
is
that
portion
which
is
intended
to
be
the
request
for
declaratory
as
well
as
injunctive
relief.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
have
not
learned
in
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
you
might.
yes,
your
honor.
you
might
as
to
some
aspects.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
you
would
not,
but
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that’s
right,
your
honor.
it
was
our
--
it
was
anticipated
that
the
injunctive
aspect
of
the
relief,
if
gotten,
need
not
simply
be
a
recital.
the
past
events
being
wrong
and
enjoining
future
events,
rather
it
might
be
directed
at
specific
items.
for
example,
specifically
ordering
the
guard
no
longer
to
carry
loaded
weapons,
into
engagement.
it
was
believed
that
in
that
certain
aspects
to
the
injunction
could
be
specific
whereas
certain
aspects
of
the
declaratory
judgment
might
be
more
general
in
terms.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
it
was
anticipated,
so
that
was
the
request.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
among
the
possible,
appropriately
some
might
be
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
the
rules
of
engagement
in
ohio
were
highly
objectionable.
it
was
anticipated
that
we
would
seek
either
a
specific
order
directed
at
specific
items,
or
that
the
court
would
order
the
defendants
in
the
event
that
it
found
wrongdoing,
to
come
forward
with
a
plan
for
ratification
of
the
conditions
and
then
into
the
plan.
as
part
of
its
order,
if
it
found
the
plan
to
be
adequate,
it
was
anticipated
in
court
that
it
might
well
be
the
army’s
rules
of
engagement
or
those
noted
by
judge
edmund
in
his
opinion
below.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
there
are
numerous
alternatives,
but
at
this
point,
the
rules
which
are
present
in
the
appendices
produced
by
the
army
are
sufficient,
but
we
believe
that
they
deal
only
with
a
certain
aspect
of
the
case.
and
in
addition,
that
may
will
be
necessary
to
have
them
entered
as
an
order
at
this
time
for
that
specific
purpose.
what
we
believe
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
maintain
the
existing
army
rules
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
would
satisfy
us
as
to
the
bulk
of
our
case,
but
we
perceive
a
substantial
difference
between
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
rules
are
in
force
and
the
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
rules
are
actually
enforced,
and
enforced
over
a
continuous
period
of
time
by
adequate
training
of
the
troops,
by
continuous
training
of
the
troops.
ohio,
prior
to
the
time
in
question,
did
not
have
these
rules.
ohio
might
well
go
back
to
its
old
rules
in
the
future.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
ohio
has
made
an
irrevocable
decision
for
these
rules.
the
rules
are
not
law,
they
are
not
law
in
ohio,
and
they
are
not
law
in
united
states.
in
addition
to
which
as
i
have
said,
it
is
basically
a
district
court
function
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
language
of
the
rules
is
actually
conveyed
to
the
troops
by
instruction
and
by
order.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
i
suppose
we
could.
it’s
taken
us
over
two
years
now
to
have
an
adjudication
and
we
still
have
not
yet
had
a
district
court
entering
order
or
decide.
i
would
assume
that
what
with
the
complicated
procedural
problems
involved
in
a
prospective
course
of
action
directed
against
the
government.
the
district
court
might
well
see
dismissal
as
a
logical
way
to
act.
it’s
important
i
believe
to
have
these
questions
decided
now,
assuming
as
you
say,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
proper
case,
is
justiciable
and
the
courts
do
have
standing.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
three
plaintiffs
have
all
graduated.
the
action
was
brought
as
a
class
action
at
the
time
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
entire
class
--
the
kent
state
university
student
body
is
the
class
represented.
none
of
the
three
named
plaintiffs
are
now
members
of
the
kent
student
body.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
have
not
sought,
but
we’ll
seek
at
the
district
court
level.
we
have
been
requested
by
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
believe
at
this
point,
the
complaint
stands
on
itself.
at
the
appropriate
time,
the
district
court
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
see
no
provision
in
the
rules
for
substituting
at
this
point.
the
district
court
can
substitute
and
we
have
been
requested
by
the
president
--
the
present
president
for
the
student
body
to
intervene
him
when
we
have
the
opportunity.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
have
not
asked
this
court
for
an
order.
as
i
said,
it
is
our
plan
to
seek
substitution
at
the
district
court
level
and
i
believe
that
the
cases
support
the
proposition
and
that’s
the
appropriate
place.
rule
25
speaks
to
substituting
defendants
at
any
stage
rather
than
substituting
plaintiffs
in
any
stage
or
proceedings.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor,
i
have
a
rather
lengthy
answer
for
that
question
because
it
requires
an
exploration
of
the
entire
standing
doctrine.
basically,
this
case
is
a
live
justiciable
case
because
of
the
specific
events.
the
complaint
alleges
and
we
believe
we
can
prove
that
there
were
specific
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights.
there
were
people
killed,
there
were
people
shot,
there
were
beatings
administered,
there
were
detentions,
there
were
lawful
assemblies
broken
up.
we
believe
we
can
prove
all
of
that
and
we’ve
alleged
to
all
of
that.
there's
been
a
specific
concrete
controversy.
it’s
an
event
which
was
explored
at
great
length
by
numerous
commissions,
but
we
believe
it’s
highly
justiciable
in
nature,
in
that,
it
relates
to
specific
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
government
in
the
past.
now,
the
key,
the
key
to
the
prospective
aspect
of
the
case
is
this
specific
wrongdoing.
it’s
in
that
sense
that
this
case
is
different
from
several
of
the
cases
in
recent
years
in
which
the
court
has
found
no
standing
because
of
an
absence
of
a
past
event.
that
is
we
are
not
seeking
merely
guidance
for
the
future;
we
are
seeking
guidance
for
the
future
arising
out
of
a
specific
event.
the
next
question
is,
what
is
the
nexus
as
to
these
particular
plaintiffs
to
this
past
event.
the
answer
to
that
is
complex.
but
basically,
the
past
event
forms
the
factual
basis
out
of
which
we
conclude
in
the
complaint
that
very
real
risk
exist
of
repetition
in
the
event
of
future
demonstrations,
future
lawful
assemblies.
the
plaintiffs
are
as
exposed
to
that
as
any
other
person
on
the
kent
state
university
campus,
but
students
at
kent
state
university
campus
at
the
time
of
the
filing
to
this
complain,
were
peculiarly
exposed
to
that
risk
because
of
what
had
happened
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
relationship
of
the
local
police
and
the
national
guard
to
that
community.
it
was
therefore
felt
and
it
is
still
felt
that
they
are
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
same
kind
of
conduct
and
that
the
factual
basis
on
which
a
court
can
act
has
got
to
be
this
past
conduct
in
which
we
seek
to
prove
that
certain
things
were
done
as
alleged
and
were
results
of
the
inadequacies
which
we
alleged
to
have
led
to
them.
that
is
what
makes
it
a
specific
controversy
as
opposed
to
a
law
suit
in
which
a
plaintiff
walks
into
the
court
and
says,
“i
hear
the
government
is
doing
something,
i
think
it
may
affect
me.
therefore,
i’d
like
to
bring
an
action.”
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
this
is
a
very
specific
background.
there
was
a
very
specific
conduct
and
it
is
very
specific
conduct
that
we
are
aiming
at.
it
is
only
at
kent
state
university
student
who
is
subjected
to
this
risk.
by
the
same
token
though,
a
kent
state
university
student
is
as
much
exposed
to
these
particular
risks
in
the
future
and
was
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
as
people
who
were
actually
been
subjected.
now,
we’ve
complained
about
a
bunch
of
diverse
constitutional
deprivations,
one
of
which
is
shooting.
now,
it
is
hard
to
see
for
the
purposes
of
prospective
relief,
why
the
court
would
want
to
require
somebody
who
was
actually
shot
to
be
the
plaintiff,
when
the
key
of
prospective
relief
is
preventing
future
shootings.
we
say
similar
things
about
beatings
and
about
detentions.
now,
as
to
the
breakup
of
lawful
assemblies,
the
complaint
does
not
allege
that
these
plaintiffs
were
participating
in
the
assemblies
which
were
broken
up.
now,
as
to
that
we
believe
the
complaint
does
not
preclude
us
from
proving
that
they
were
in
fact
participants
in
those
lawful
assemblies.
in
fact,
we
read
the
rule
of
conley
versus
gibson
as
holding
that
unless
your
complaint
establishes
that
your
are
not
in
fact
capable
of
proving
that
which
entitles
you
to
relief,
then
you
may
not
be
dismissed.
we
think
that
the
question
of
this
entitlement
as
to
that
item
is
properly
a
defensive
matter
or
a
matter
for
a
single
judgment.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that’s
right
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
theory
of
inadequate
training,
the
theory
of
improper
orders,
the
theory
of
improper
arming
of
the
troops.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
i
don’t
think
your
honor,
that
that
question
can
be
avoided.
what
happened
in
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
dismissed
without
an
opinion.
as
a
result
we
have
really
no
guidance
as
to
what
his
thinking
was.
judge
edwards
wrote
the
controlling
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
for
the
panel
of
the
sixth
circuit.
judge
edwards
split
the
complaint
in
three
parts,
properly
so.
one
part
of
the
complaint
deals
with
the
claim
that
a
section
of
ohio
law
which
the
national
guard
had
read
as
giving
it
an
immunity
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
judge
edwards
construed
that
narrowly
and
dismissed
it.
the
other
claim
deals
with
the
power
of
the
court
to
enjoin
the
governor
of
ohio
from
future
use
of
the
national
guard
prematurely.
judge
edwards
dismissed
that
on
the
ground
that
it
was
in
effect
a
prior
restraint
and
not
justified.
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
the
reasons
why
certiorari
was
not
filed
on
that,
which
leaves
the
rest
of
the
complaint
which
judge
edwards
ordered
to
dismiss
and
he
quotes
in
his
opinion
from
the
relevant
paragraphs
which
he
concludes,
stated
the
cause
of
action.
i
am
reading
now
from
page
15
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
contains
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
the
allegations
are
the
portion
of
the
complaint
which
he
find
subject
to
remand
are
subparts
a,
b,
c,
and
d
of
the
controlling
paragraph
describing
the
wrongs.
those
are
the
ones
which
describe
the
separate
wrongs,
which
are
an
issue
and
as
i
have
said
they
are
basically
the
shootings,
the
beatings,
the
detentions
without
arrest
and
the
breakup
of
assemblies
which
we
allege.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
accept
that
as
one
of
the
four
substantive
questions
which
i
believe
his
remand
puts
an
issue
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
one
of
the
four,
his
statement
of
that
portion
of
the
complaint
which
deals
with
the
unjustifiable
killings
and
shootings
is
perfectly
adequate
and
i
fully
accept
that
statement.
the
other
sub-paragraphs
of
the
complaint
which
he
had
just
quoted
from
include
cause
of
unlawful
and
unjustified
beatings,
unlawful
detentions,
and
breakup
of
lawful
and
peaceable
assemblies.
in
each
of
those
instances,
judge
edwards
in
his
opinion
italicized
the
key
language.
when
he
came
to
framing
the
question,
he
framed
only
the
question
as
it
related
to
the
shootings,
that
is
the
use
of
lethal
force
with
non-lethal
force
was
reasonably
necessary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
seems
to
me
he
has
remanded
all
the
questions
because
he
goes
onto
hold,
that
relief
is
appropriate
as
to
that
--
those
portions
of
the
complaint
that
key
question
in
part
is
the
entitlement
of
one
to
have
a
judicial
forum,
here
one's
claim
for
relief
and
that
those
aspects
of
the
complaint
are
distinguishable
from
those
portions
which
he
split
off
dealt
with
separate
land
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
think
that
your
honor,
fairly
read
the
complaint
raises
three
questions
which
are
admittedly
lesses
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
four
in
all.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
are
subsidiary
to
that
matter
and
that
maybe
dealt
with
independently.
now,
judge
edwards
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
your
honor,
it
may
well
be
that
judge
edwards
saw
those
matters
as
a
subsidiary
to
the
question
of
the
actual
use
of
deadly
weapons.
in
the
proposal
that
he
sets
forward
his
appendix
to
his
opinion,
he
deals
with
matters
which
relate
to
much
more
than
merely
the
use
of
deadly
force.
he
deals
with
the
futons,
he
deals
with
the
vein
which
a
mob
have
to
be
engaged
etcetera.
it's
possible
to
see
the
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
national
guard
is
authorized
to
detain
people,
to
beat
people
and
more
specifically
to
breakup
assemblies
as
subsidiary
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
way
in
which
it
conducts
itself
is
integral
to
an
unreasonable
risk
creation
as
to
death
or
shooting.
it
is
possible
to
see
the
most
subsidiary.
it
is
also
possible
to
see
the
most
separable.
it
is
our
position
that
the
complaint
should
fairly
be
read
as
treating
them
as
separable,
although
i
understand
that
judge
edwards’
opinion
tends
to
see
them
as
subsidiary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
court
issues
an
order
thereafter
the
--
the
order
enjoins
the
defendants
from
ordering
them
for
beating
their
troops
to
breakup
lawful
and
peaceable
assemblies.
thereafter,
the
defendant
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
not
for
purposes
of
a
contempt
power
of
the
court
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
for
example
that
the
defendant
did
in
fact
breakup
at
least
two
lawful
and
peaceable
assemblies.
i
know
of
no
mechanism
other
than
the
contempt
power
of
the
united
states
district
court
which
would
give
any
of
the
plaintiffs
or
their
representatives,
you
are
willing
to
call
the
defendants
to
task
for
that.
it
is
our
belief
that
the
injunction
is
necessary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
on
the
ground
your
honor
that
they
have
in
fact
broken
up
lawful
assemblies
in
the
past,
that
is
acted
unlawfully.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
hague
versus
c.i.o.
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
which
incorporated
in
part
the
opinion
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
there
were
four
opinions
in
the
court
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
my
recollection
is
that
at
one
point
of
my
brief,
i
have
traced
down
the
--
i
have
got
in
the
footnote
here,
haven’t
i?
i
see
six
votes
on
the
court
for
the
proposition
that
the
assembly
--
that
the
breakup
of
an
unlawful
assembly
is
a
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right
and
that
a
court
may
act
in
its
equity
jurisdictions
to
enjoin
that
future
conduct.
and
if
i
can
find
the
appropriate
page,
justice
roberts
for
himself
and
justice
black,
and
justice
stone
for
himself
and
justice
reed
and
chief
justice
hughes,
five
votes,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
justice
douglas
and
justice
frankfurter
did
not
participate
and
i
guess
that
leaves
us
with
three
dissenters.
so,
i
see
five,
five
votes,
two
dissenters.
i
see
five
votes
for
their
proposition
all
of
whom
were
agreed,
although
i
recognize
that
justice
stone
got
there
a
different
way
and
that's
the
basis
for
our
proposition.
thereafter
of
course,
the
district
courts
and
the
circuit
courts
have
expended
to
a
great
extent
on
that
power.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
i
can
grant
you
one
rock,
your
honor,
which
will
mean
a
crime.
that
would
not
be
a
right
under
ohio
law
that
would
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
constitution
does
not
protect
an
assembly
in
which
rocks
or
a
rock
are
thrown.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that’s
right.
i
am
willing
to
accept
that
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
you
have
changed
the
facts
on
me.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
we
do
not
want
that
law,
but
the
fact
--
the
question
is
may
the
assembly
be
broken
up
as
a
consequence
of
one
act
to
violence.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
question,
i
think
it
can
be,
but
the
other
side
of
the
question
is
may
the
assembly
be
broken
up
as
a
result
of
no
acts
of
violence,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
one
is
got
to
be
no.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
exactly,
it
is
truly
a
factual
point.
it
is
likewise
true
that
we
allege
as
a
factual
matter
that
defendants
did
breakup
a
lawful
assembly
and
we
plan
to
prove
that
the
assemblies
were
in
fact
wholly
lawful
and
wholly
peaceful
at
the
time
of
the
national
guard
acted
to
break
them
up.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
conditions
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
particular
assembly?
other
assemblies
have
occurred.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
is
not
in
the
records,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
occurred
after
the
day
of
the
complaint
your
honor.
it
is
not
lawful,
it
is
--
i
have
taken
a
position
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
class
as
of
now
consists
of
all
students
of
kent
state
university.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
which
consists
of
different
persons
from
when
it
was
filed.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
different
persons,
same
class.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
is
in
the
nature
of
the
class.
the
key
through
the
class
action
under
rule
23
(b)2
is
prospective
relief.
is
it
likely
that
defendants
will
act
toward
the
entire
class
in
a
way
such
as
to
justify
prospective
relief.
that
is
the
key
to
the
whole
complaint,
but
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
we're
in
difficult
position
here
because
the
fact
that
all
we
have
got
is
a
bad
complaint.
it
would
be
much
preferable,
if
we
had
a
record
to
deal
with,
but
we
do
not,
and
therefore
all
we
got
to
do
is
deal
with
influences.
now,
we
have
--
we're
willing
to
rest
on
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
now.
i
think
it
is
terribly
proper
for
me
to
come
here
and
try
to
tell
the
court
that
we
can
prove
things
which
are
beyond
the
face
of
the
complaint.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
is
contrary
point.
we
believe
--
we
believe
first
of
all
as
a
matter
of
law
that
because
of
the
wrong
doing,
because
of
the
very
specific
acts
even
if
these
regulations
are
legitimate,
they
should
be
entered
as
an
order
and
an
order
or
declaratory
judgment
should
be
entered
so
as
to
preclude
any
return
to
the
old
ways.
in
that
sense,
the
controversy
is
not
mooted.
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
would
go
very
far
to
satisfying
us.
the
other
aspect
of
a
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that’s
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
standing
justiciability,
the
absence
of
mootness
are
pre-requisites
to
this
court's
acting
or
continuation
and
the
actual
about
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
is
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
district
court
has
got
to
enter
an
order.
thereafter
the
district
court
has
got
to
make
itself
available
for
a
counsel
to
bring
to
its
attention
any
matters
including
the
counsel
for
the
defendants
in
the
event
that
they
seek
to
modify
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
i
believe
that
counsel
can
be
authorized
to
marshal
periodically
the
nature
of
the
training
and
to
make
available
to
the
court
whatever
evidence
is
necessary.
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
could
be
done
by
access.
it
could
be
done
by
permitting
counsel
to
come
forward
and
produce
witnesses.
a
motion
for
contempt
is
ordinarily
subject
to
proof
before
the
court
or
motion
for
modification
can
be
some
of
the
subjects.
courts
have
traditionally
and
increasingly
over
the
last
few
years
given
injunctive
relief
which
requires
the
injunction
to
be
administered.
it
has
been
done
in
bankruptcy
practice
for
many
years,
several
of
the
circuit
courts
in
the
last
few
years
have
upheld
the
issuance
of
relatively
broad
decrees
dealing
with
the
conduct
of
prisons
and
the
conduct
of
other
administrative
functions
to
the
state.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
the
court
could
send
a
master,
the
court
could
authorize
the
attorneys
or
their
representatives
to
appear
and
observe.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
might
be
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
it
would
not
be
required,
it
would
be
one
of
the
ways
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
all
i
can
say
your
honor,
is
that
that
over
the
past
few
years,
i
have
to
come
to
know
an
awful
lot
about
what
the
ohio
national
guard
is
doing
on
a
relatively
ongoing
basis
as
a
result
of
the
availability
of
witnesses.
it
is
not
the
cia,
it
is
not
a
secret
organization.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
its
people
are
part
time
soldiers,
they
are
soldiers
on
weekends,
or
for
a
couple
of
weeks
during
the
summer
doing
the
rest
of
the
time,
that's
not
any
(inaudible)
secrecy.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
believe
that
we
can
produce
expert
witnesses
testify
as
to
the
training
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
adequate.
where
upon
the
court
can
become
convinced
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
or
there
is
not
adequate
training.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
personally
am
not
an
expert.
we
have
consulted
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
district
court
can
be
made
an
expert
to
the
extent
that
there
is
not
any
other
(inaudible)
to
produce
witnesses.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
courts
hear
medical
witnesses,
medical
expert
witnesses
on
a
daily
basis.
district
judges
have
decide
practice
cases
involving
complicated
problems
of
organic
chemistry,
without
having
taken
the
chemistry
course
in
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
a
very
substantial
interference
with
the
national
guard
conduct.
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
we
have
alleged
and
hope
to
prove
that
the
national
guard
in
ohio
has
been
responsible
for
some
very
serious
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights.
we
believe
that
in
that
context
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
some
of
them
have.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
the
unit
remains
the
same.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
the
particular
defendants
have
been
changed,
but
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
if
you
want
me
to
go
beyond
the
record
your
honor,
the
answer
is
that
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
do
i
know
for
fact?
i
have
some
evidences
to
indicate
that
the
quality
of
training
as
to
these
matters
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor,
it's
absolutely
right.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
you
asked
me
the
question
your
honor,
i
feel
very
uncomfortable
going
beyond
the
record.
the
fact
of
the
matter
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
i
believe
as
a
district
judge
has
followed,
i
mean
there
is
just
--
it
is
a
--
you
can't
criticize
the
defendant
from
making
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
rules
authorize
the
defendant.
you
can't
criticize
the
district
judge
for
improperly
granting
a
motion
to
dismiss.
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
a
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor
and
this
i
don't
believe
is
one
of
them
at
the
time
this
complaint
was
filed.
it
has
stated
a
good
cause
of
action.
i
believe
that
to
this
day
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
it
states
a
good
cause
of
action.
if
these
case
were
remanded
and
a
factual
record
made,
then
this
court
would
have
before
it
questions
of
the
adequacy
of
the
training,
questions
which
relate
to
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs,
specifically
a
factual
record
on
the
question
of
eminence.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
is
right,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
the
question
of
mootness,
as
the
court
framed
the
issue
of
mootness
in
the
wt
grant
case,
there
are
really
two
senses
in
which
a
case
can
become
moot.
the
first
sense
is
a
pure
outright
change
of
law,
hall
versus
beals
is
an
example
of
that
kind
of
case
in
which
the
court
concluded
the
law
had
changed
and
therefore
the
controversy
no
longer
existed.
the
second
situation
is
a
situation
in
which
the
claimant
has
put
forth
that
that
which
was
highly
likely
at
a
proceeding
time
is
no
longer
highly
likely
because
of
a
change
in
circumstances.
that
is
a
factual
issue.
it
is
an
issue
to
be
set
decided
by
a
district
judge.
the
district
judge
as
we
all
know
has
discretion
in
granting
injunctive
relief
and
it
can
very
well
deny
injunctive
relief
on
the
ground
that
while
he
has
found
wrong
doing,
he
now
finds
that
the
circumstances
are
not
such
as
to
warrant
the
entering
even
injunction.
that's
a
district
judge’s
function.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
what
we
are
seeking
at
this
point.
understanding
that
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
we
were
seeking
a
more
specific
change
in
what
then
existed.
your
honor,
there
is
one
further
point
which
has
come
up
on
couple
of
occasions
and
i
have
never
really
specifically
addressed
myself
to
and
that
is
the
relationship
of
laird
versus
tatum
to
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
has
gone
to
some
length
to
demonstrate
the
way
in
which
this
case
is
like
laird.
we
think
this
case
is
different
from
laird
in
several
respects.
laird
was
basically
a
case
in
which
the
conduct
of
the
defendants
were
not
itself
unlawful
and
did
not
in
itself
involve
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right,
but
it
was
alleged
that
the
chilling
effect
of
the
defendants’
conduct
created
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
right.
so,
what
it
was,
it
was
an
attempt
to
bootstrap
from
an
injury
into
a
deprivation
of
a
right.
now,
irrespective
of
what
i
personally
may
think
about
that
in
the
privacy
area,
this
case
is
crucially
different.
first
of
all,
it
is
different
in
the
sense
that
the
people
that
are
subjected
to
the
kinds
of
injuries
that
occurred
here
and
which
we
see
as
possibly
appearing
in
the
future
or
the
opposite
of
the
people
who
were
going
to
be
chilled,
they
are
the
people
who
actually
participate
in
the
assemblies
and
so
we
believe
that
that
first
of
all
chilling
effect
as
to
these
people
is
really
not
pertinent
to
the
question
of
injury
here
or
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
complaint
states
a
wrong.
that's
the
first
different
the
way
in
which
the
case
is
different
from
laird.
the
second
way,
in
which
the
case
is
different
from
laird
lies
in
the
fact
that
this
case
alleges
an
injury
which
is
very
specific
in
nature
and
which
has
been
held
by
preceding
cases
to
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
deprivation.
that
is
one
who
is
unjustifiably
killed
by
government
action
is
in
fact
subjected
to
a
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right.
so,
that
the
inquiry
into
the
defendants’
conduct
stems
from
a
specific
constitutional
right
as
opposed
to
the
laird
case
in
which
there
is
no
specific
constitutional
right,
but
the
subject,
the
feeling
of
injury
is
said
to
be
enough
to
lead
to
the
finding
of
a
constitutional
deprivation.
i
think
that
is
a
very
substantial
difference.
there
is
one
further
aspect
of
laird
which
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
and
that
is
the
assumption
that
the
assumption
present
in
this
case
which
we
have
come
to
on
a
couple
of
our
occasions
that
the
nature
of
the
training
will
be
adequate
to
assure
that
the
new
rules
of
engagement
are
in
fact
more
forth
to
choose.
we
have
heard
a
good
deal
on
the
way
of
assurances
from
the
defendants,
there
is
more
on
the
briefs
and
what
we
see
in
laird
about
this
is
that
exactly,
very
similar
kinds
of
assurances
were
made
to
the
court
at
that
time.
specifically,
there
are
assurances
with
respect
to
the
retention
of
documents
etcetera.
it
was
then
found
by
a
senate
committee
that
documents
had
not
in
fact
been
retained.
we
believe
that
all
of
these
matters,
matters
with
respect
to
what
the
orders
are
and
how
they
are
implemented
are
purely
matters
of
proof
and
therefore
specifically
functions
for
a
district
rather
than
in
appellate
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
