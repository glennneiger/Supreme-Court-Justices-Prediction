mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
not
a
party
to
this
case
and
had
no
direct
role
in
the
events
which
occurred
at
kent
in
may
1970.
the
actors
there
were
officers
and
members
of
the
ohio
national
guard,
a
state
organization
acting
at
that
time
under
state
authority.
however,
the
united
states
army
is
responsible
for
the
training
of
the
national
guard.
consequently,
the
united
states
is
much
concerned
about
this
case
and
the
possible
impact
of
the
decision
below
and
the
complications
which
would
inevitably
ensue
if
the
federal
court
should
undertake
to
exercise
over
sight
of
the
training
of
the
national
guard.
under
the
system
established
by
congress,
national
guard
units
are
ordinarily
under
state
command
and
operational
control.
they
receive
federal
financial
support
though,
only
if
they
maintain
“federal
recognition”
by
meeting
prescribed
federal
standards.
state
is
free
to
have
to
support
its
own
national
guard
in
a
way
it
wants
to,
but
to
obtain
federal
control
and
the
federal
support,
they
must
meet
the
federal
standards.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
state
which
might
now
meet
federal
standards.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
have
been
in
the
past,
in
the
distant
past,
but
and
indeed
the
present
national
guard
organization
only
dates
from
the
early
part
of
this
century.
the
whole
business
of
trying
to
handle
the
civil
war
was
largely
done
through
state
that
raised
troops.
the
statute
passed
by
congress
authorizes
the
president
to,
again
i
quote,
“prescribe
regulations
and
issue
orders
necessary
to
organize,
discipline,
and
govern
the
national
guard.”
and
this
is
pursuant
to
the
provision
of
the
constitution
which
gives
congress
the
power
to
provide
for
organizing,
arming,
and
disciplining
the
militia
and
reserves
to
the
states
the
authority
of
training
the
militia
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress.
the
provision
for
uniform,
training,
or
discipline
ensures
that
the
militia
can
be
effectively
integrated
into
the
regular
army
if
the
need
arises.
the
constitution
contemplates
that
the
federal
government
will
prescribe
the
training
program
but
the
state
actually
administers
the
training
as
long
as
the
guard
has
not
been
federalized.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
have
adopted
the
federal
standards
since
this
case
was
begun
and
i
will
come
to
the
details
of
that
in
just
a
moment.
the
army
is
naturally,
primarily
concerned
with
ensuring
that
the
guard
is
qualified
to
serve
as
a
part
of
the
army
if
called
into
active
federal
duty,
but
the
army
has
also
promulgated
detailed
instructions
for
civil
defense
control
training
and
this
training
program
is
for
national
guardsmen
as
well
as
for
members
of
the
regular
army.
beginning
in
1971,
the
army
began
to
give
national
guard
recruits
16
hours
of
additional
special
civil
service,
civil
disturbance
control
training.
now,
this
special
training
was
initiated
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
guard
units
are
more
likely
to
be
called
to
suppress
civil
disturbance
within
our
regular
army
units.
an
important
aspect
that
civil
disturbance
control
training
is
the
rules
governing
the
use
of
force.
when
the
guard
is
in
state
stages,
it
is
subject
to
the
state's
use
of
force
regulations.
the
national
guards
of
all
states,
including
ohio,
have
now
voluntarily
adopted
the
federal
standards
on
use
of
force
as
their
own.
at
the
time
of
the
kent
state
incident,
however,
in
may
1970,
the
ohio
rules
were
substantially
different
from
the
federal
rules
and
different
from
what
they
are
today.
the
army
rules
which
have
been
in
effect
since
march
1968
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
the
government’s
brief
beginning
on
page
29.
and
the
relevant
portions
are
stated
on
pages
33
and
34
of
the
government’s
brief.
i
read
from
the
top
of
page
33.
these
are
the
federal
regulations
now
adopted
by
the
ohio
national
guard
and
all
other
national
guard.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
by
ohio
late
in
1970
since
the
events
and
since
this
suit
was
brought.
i
read
from
the
top
of
page
33,
the
presence
of
loaded
weapons
--
well,
let
me
change
to
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief
where
they
are
summarized
rather
than
the
full
text.
the
rules
provide
detailed
regulations
for
the
use
of
deadly
force
and
it
is
authorized
only
where
just
above
the
middle
of
page
13.
“lesser
means
have
been
exhausted
are
unavailable.
the
risk
of
death
or
seriously
bodily
harm
to
innocent
persons
is
not
significantly
increased
by
its
use
and
the
purpose
of
its
use
is
one
or
more
of
the
following;
self-defense
to
avoid
death
or
serious
bodily
harm,
prevention
of
a
crime
which
involves
a
substantial
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm.
for
example,
setting
fire
to
an
inhabited
dwelling
or
sniping,
including
the
defense
of
other
persons.
prevention
of
the
destruction
of
public
utilities
or
similar
property
vital
to
public
health
or
safety
or
the
detention
or
prevention
of
the
escape
of
persons
who
have
committed
or
attempted
to
commit
one
of
the
serious
offenses
referred
to
in
a,
b,
and
c
above.”
and
then
with
respect
to
live
ammunition,
the
present
rules
of
force
provide
as
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
14,
“task
force
commanders
are
authorized
to
have
live
ammunition
issued
to
personnel
under
their
command.
individual
soldiers
will
be
instructed
however
that
they
may
not
load
their
weapons
except
when
authorized
by
an
officer
or
provided
they
are
not
under
the
direct
control
and
the
supervision
of
an
officer
when
the
circumstances
would
justify
their
use
of
deadly
force.
retention
of
control
by
an
officer
over
the
loading
of
weapons
until
such
time
as
the
need
for
such
action
as
clearly
established,
is
a
critical
importance
in
preventing
the
unjustified
use
of
deadly
force.
whenever
possible,
command
and
controlled
arrangements
should
be
specifically
designed
to
facilitate
such
careful
control
of
deadly
weapons.
it’s
obviously
a
difficult
and
delicate
situation.
you
might
have
an
individual
soldier
out
alone
where
he
might
have
to
use
his
judgment,
but
it
is
placed
under
the
control
of
an
officer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
ohio
rules
which
were
then
enforced
are
said
out
on
pages
41
to
45
of
the
government’s
brief
and
i
would
call
attention
to
what
they
were
and
the
complete
change
between
that
and
the
present
rules.
this
appears
on
page
43
in
the
appendix
b
to
the
government’s
brief
under
the
heading,
f,
weapons,
“when
all
other
means
have
failed
or
chemicals
are
not
readily
available,
you
are
armed
with
a
rifle
and
have
been
issued
live
ammunition.”
now,
that’s
pretty
much
encouragement
i
should
think.
the
following
rules
apply
in
the
use
of
fire
arms:
one,
rifles
will
be
carried
with
a
round
in
the
chamber,
in
the
safe
position.
they
are
to
carry
loaded
weapons.
exercise,
care,
and
be
safety
minded
at
all
times.
well,
there
is
not
much
suggestion
about
safety
as
to
the
other
people.
and
then
i
will
skip
over
to
the
--
well,
two,
indiscriminate
firing
of
weapons
is
forbidden;
only
single
aim
shot
at
confirmed
targets
will
be
employed.
potential
targets
are,
and
then
i
will
turn
to
c
at
the
top
of
the
page
44.
“in
any
instance
where
human
life
is
in
danger
by
the
foreseeable
violent
action
of
a
rioter
or
and
it’s
or
when
rioters
to
whom
the
riot
act
has
been
read
cannot
be
dispersed
by
any
other
reasonable
means
then
shooting
is
justified.”
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
i
am
to
have
some
of
mr.
martin’s
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
he
had
some
left.
now,
in
december
1970,
some
seven
months
following
the
shooting
at
kent
state,
the
ohio
national
guard
issued
a
new
operational
plan
which
adopted
the
army
use
of
force
rules
verbatim.
now,
this
appears
on
orders
of
the
adjutant
general
of
ohio,
which
have
been
filed
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
i
think
that
such
orders
ought
to
have
the
status
of
regulations
and
ought
to
be
capable
of
being
taken
judicial
notice
out
by
the
court.
and
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
legal
position
or
it
seems
to
me
that
first,
we
have
a
good
old
question
quite
apart
from
political
question,
quite
apart
from
the
standing,
simply
of
equitable
jurisdiction.
the
only
prayer
in
this
complaint
is
for
equitable
jurisdiction
and
this
appears
on
page
10,
wherefore
plaintiff's
request
that
this
court
enter
judgment
as
follows:
(a)
enjoining
defendant
roll;
(b)
enjoining
defendant
rule;
(c)
enjoining
defendant
rule;
(d),
enjoining
defendants
and
their
successors,
and
finally
(e)
declaring
a
section
of
the
ohio
revised
code
to
be
unconstitutional
and
void.
that
is
a
declaratory
judgment,
but
the
court
below
decided
that
against
the
respondents
here
and
they
did
not
file
any
petition
and
it
is
not
before
the
court.
now,
i
recognize
that
one
isn’t
completely
bound
by
the
prayer,
but
there
isn’t
a
slightest
doubt
that
this
suit
was
not
brought
and
cannot
be
brought
because
of
the
harm
that
was
done
to
any
one
at
kent
state
in
1970.
this
is
not
a
tort
suit
and
there
would
not
be
federal
jurisdiction
of
this
case
as
a
tort
suit,
but
there
is
no
basis
for
this
suit
except
as
a
suit
to
enjoin
a
violation,
a
threatened
violation
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
mere
showing
that
there
was
an
event,
once
in
the
past
that
does
not
provide
a
basis
for
equitable
jurisdiction.
a
recent
case
which
is
fairly
close
to
that
is
laird
and
tatum.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
prayer
for
a
declaratory
judgment
except
with
respect
to
this
one
section
of
the
ohio
statute
which
they
lost
below
and
did
not
seek
to
bring
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
find
that
considerable
to
--
well,
sub-paragraph
f
is
such
other
and
further
--
granting
such
other
and
further
relief
as
this
court
deems
just
and
proper
and
i
assume
that
this
court
will
grant
such
further
relief
as
it
deems
just
and
proper.
i
don’t
think
that
really
adds
to
the
scope
of
the
claim
which
is
solely
for
an
injunction
and
i
also
have
considerable
feeling
that
the
same
rules
as
to
equitable
jurisdiction
are
applicable
to
a
declaratory
judgment
which
is
really
a
kind
of
injunction
which
doesn’t
have
quite
the
immediate
tithe
that
an
injunction
has,
but
it
is
res
judicata
and
you
can
then
come
in
and
apply
to
the
court
for
an
order
to
comply
with
it.
something
was
done
at
kent
state
which
was
unfortunate.
a
firm
action
was
taken
to
correct
the
regulations
and
instructions
and
training
of
the
ohio
national
guard.
this
may
well
have
been
due
to
federal
influence,
though
that
does
not
appear
affirmatively
in
the
record.
in
this
situation,
it’s
my
contention
that
it’s
not
appropriate
for
the
courts
to
intervene
and
undertake
to
prescribe
or
supervise
the
training
of
the
national
guard.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
is
the
court
limited
to
the
new
regulation?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
the
propriety
of
equitable
relief,
it
was.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
certainly
not.
i
don’t
approve
of
the
old
ones
and
i
gather
that
neither
does
ohio
now,
but
that
leads
me
to
the
next
question,
the
question
of
standing.
the
respondents
here
would
appear
to
have
no
personal
standing.
they
weren’t
injured
at
kent
state.
i’m
advised
that
they
are
no
longer
students
of
kent
state.
that
would
appear
from
the
offices
they
held
in
the
lapse
of
merely
three
years.
they
purport
to
bring
the
suit
as
a
class
action.
there
is
at
least
a
problem
as
to
whether
a
class
action
can
be
maintained
by
persons
who
are
no
longer
members
of
the
class.
they
allege
that
a
wrong
was
committed
in
may
1970,
but
they
do
not
sue
because
of
the
wrong,
and
the
district
court
below
would
not
have
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
based
on
that
wrong.
because
of
the
one
event,
they
say
that
their
rights
are
threatened,
but
their
claim
of
future
harm
is
wholly
speculative.
they
base
their
claim
upon
the
single
incident
at
kent
state
in
may
1970
and
ignored
the
substantial
revisions
that
have
since
been
made.
there
is
here
no
ongoing
event
or
program
which
the
respondents
will
inevitably
confront.
they
allege
merely
that
such
an
event
may
occur
at
some
unspecified
time
in
the
unstated
future.
now
courts
of
equity
should
not
exercise
their
injunctive
power
at
large
in
the
absence
of
a
more
specific
threat
of
potential
harm
than
is
alleged
here.
indeed,
the
case
is
here
in
a
rather
odd
and
highly
artificial
posture.
the
sole
relief
here,
claimed
is
prospective,
equitable,
and
injunctive.
but
(1)
the
plaintiffs
are
no
longer
students;
(2)
the
original
defendants
are
no
longer
in
office.
there
is
a
new
governor,
a
new
adjutant
general,
both
of
whom
have
made
it
plain
that
they
do
not
support
the
rules
upon
which
action
was
taken
before.
i
will
remember
when
in
filing
a
motion
to
substitute
new
government
officers,
you
had
to
get
a
declaration
from
them
as
to
whether
they
propose
to
continue
to
follow
the
same
policy.
now,
we
do
it
automatically
as
a
matter
of
course
which
is
probably
an
improvement,
but
it’s
perfectly
plain
that
the
present
officers
against
to
whom
the
injunction
is
sought
do
not
propose
to
follow
the
same
policy.
the
training
regulations
have
been
changed
and
the
statute
as
to
which
a
declaratory
judgment
was
sought
has
been
repealed.
much
of
the
talk
in
the
respondents’
brief
is
about
the
wrongs
that
the
governor
and
the
adjutant
general
did,
but
this
is
not
a
tort
suit.
it
is,
as
i
have
said,
solely
a
suit
for
an
injunction.
to
proceed
with
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
just
to
make
it
a
sort
of
phantom
case
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
when
i
have
more
time
available,
i
may
try
to
write
an
article
about
phantom
cases
in
the
supreme
court.
for
example,
bivens
decided
two
years
ago
was
a
phantom
case.
the
actual
facts
there
bear
no
relation
to
the
issue
which
was
decided
by
the
court
and
similarly,
last
term,
mandel
was
a
phantom
case
for
we
knew
facts
which
were
not
in
the
record,
which
made
it
a
very
different
case
than
it
was.
these
arise
because
people
filed
motions
to
dismiss
and
the
lower
courts
as
the
quickest
way
to
get
rid
of
a
case
and
it
seems
to
me
perhaps
doubtful
and
perhaps
questionable
under
the
case
and
controversy
standard
of
the
constitution
of
whether
the
court
should
undertake
to
decide
issues
in
cases
which
have
become
so
removed
from
reality
as
this
one
has.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
thank
you,
mr.
justice,
i’ll
be
glad
to
add
that
to
my
notes.
my
notes
have
largely
been
based
on
cases
through
my
office
and
i
will
look
for
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
accordingly
we
[laughter]
--
mr.
justice,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
would
[laughter]
i
would
like
them
very
much
and
i
will
give
credit
in
a
footnote.[laughter]
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
with
directions
that
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
not
a
party
to
this
case
and
had
no
direct
role
in
the
events
which
occurred
at
kent
in
may
1970.
the
actors
there
were
officers
and
members
of
the
ohio
national
guard,
a
state
organization
acting
at
that
time
under
state
authority.
however,
the
united
states
army
is
responsible
for
the
training
of
the
national
guard.
consequently,
the
united
states
is
much
concerned
about
this
case
and
the
possible
impact
of
the
decision
below
and
the
complications
which
would
inevitably
ensue
if
the
federal
court
should
undertake
to
exercise
over
sight
of
the
training
of
the
national
guard.
under
the
system
established
by
congress,
national
guard
units
are
ordinarily
under
state
command
and
operational
control.
they
receive
federal
financial
support
though,
only
if
they
maintain
“federal
recognition”
by
meeting
prescribed
federal
standards.
state
is
free
to
have
to
support
its
own
national
guard
in
a
way
it
wants
to,
but
to
obtain
federal
control
and
the
federal
support,
they
must
meet
the
federal
standards.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
state
which
might
now
meet
federal
standards.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
have
been
in
the
past,
in
the
distant
past,
but
and
indeed
the
present
national
guard
organization
only
dates
from
the
early
part
of
this
century.
the
whole
business
of
trying
to
handle
the
civil
war
was
largely
done
through
state
that
raised
troops.
the
statute
passed
by
congress
authorizes
the
president
to,
again
i
quote,
“prescribe
regulations
and
issue
orders
necessary
to
organize,
discipline,
and
govern
the
national
guard.”
and
this
is
pursuant
to
the
provision
of
the
constitution
which
gives
congress
the
power
to
provide
for
organizing,
arming,
and
disciplining
the
militia
and
reserves
to
the
states
the
authority
of
training
the
militia
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress.
the
provision
for
uniform,
training,
or
discipline
ensures
that
the
militia
can
be
effectively
integrated
into
the
regular
army
if
the
need
arises.
the
constitution
contemplates
that
the
federal
government
will
prescribe
the
training
program
but
the
state
actually
administers
the
training
as
long
as
the
guard
has
not
been
federalized.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
have
adopted
the
federal
standards
since
this
case
was
begun
and
i
will
come
to
the
details
of
that
in
just
a
moment.
the
army
is
naturally,
primarily
concerned
with
ensuring
that
the
guard
is
qualified
to
serve
as
a
part
of
the
army
if
called
into
active
federal
duty,
but
the
army
has
also
promulgated
detailed
instructions
for
civil
defense
control
training
and
this
training
program
is
for
national
guardsmen
as
well
as
for
members
of
the
regular
army.
beginning
in
1971,
the
army
began
to
give
national
guard
recruits
16
hours
of
additional
special
civil
service,
civil
disturbance
control
training.
now,
this
special
training
was
initiated
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
guard
units
are
more
likely
to
be
called
to
suppress
civil
disturbance
within
our
regular
army
units.
an
important
aspect
that
civil
disturbance
control
training
is
the
rules
governing
the
use
of
force.
when
the
guard
is
in
state
stages,
it
is
subject
to
the
state's
use
of
force
regulations.
the
national
guards
of
all
states,
including
ohio,
have
now
voluntarily
adopted
the
federal
standards
on
use
of
force
as
their
own.
at
the
time
of
the
kent
state
incident,
however,
in
may
1970,
the
ohio
rules
were
substantially
different
from
the
federal
rules
and
different
from
what
they
are
today.
the
army
rules
which
have
been
in
effect
since
march
1968
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
the
government’s
brief
beginning
on
page
29.
and
the
relevant
portions
are
stated
on
pages
33
and
34
of
the
government’s
brief.
i
read
from
the
top
of
page
33.
these
are
the
federal
regulations
now
adopted
by
the
ohio
national
guard
and
all
other
national
guard.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
by
ohio
late
in
1970
since
the
events
and
since
this
suit
was
brought.
i
read
from
the
top
of
page
33,
the
presence
of
loaded
weapons
--
well,
let
me
change
to
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief
where
they
are
summarized
rather
than
the
full
text.
the
rules
provide
detailed
regulations
for
the
use
of
deadly
force
and
it
is
authorized
only
where
just
above
the
middle
of
page
13.
“lesser
means
have
been
exhausted
are
unavailable.
the
risk
of
death
or
seriously
bodily
harm
to
innocent
persons
is
not
significantly
increased
by
its
use
and
the
purpose
of
its
use
is
one
or
more
of
the
following;
self-defense
to
avoid
death
or
serious
bodily
harm,
prevention
of
a
crime
which
involves
a
substantial
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm.
for
example,
setting
fire
to
an
inhabited
dwelling
or
sniping,
including
the
defense
of
other
persons.
prevention
of
the
destruction
of
public
utilities
or
similar
property
vital
to
public
health
or
safety
or
the
detention
or
prevention
of
the
escape
of
persons
who
have
committed
or
attempted
to
commit
one
of
the
serious
offenses
referred
to
in
a,
b,
and
c
above.”
and
then
with
respect
to
live
ammunition,
the
present
rules
of
force
provide
as
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
14,
“task
force
commanders
are
authorized
to
have
live
ammunition
issued
to
personnel
under
their
command.
individual
soldiers
will
be
instructed
however
that
they
may
not
load
their
weapons
except
when
authorized
by
an
officer
or
provided
they
are
not
under
the
direct
control
and
the
supervision
of
an
officer
when
the
circumstances
would
justify
their
use
of
deadly
force.
retention
of
control
by
an
officer
over
the
loading
of
weapons
until
such
time
as
the
need
for
such
action
as
clearly
established,
is
a
critical
importance
in
preventing
the
unjustified
use
of
deadly
force.
whenever
possible,
command
and
controlled
arrangements
should
be
specifically
designed
to
facilitate
such
careful
control
of
deadly
weapons.
it’s
obviously
a
difficult
and
delicate
situation.
you
might
have
an
individual
soldier
out
alone
where
he
might
have
to
use
his
judgment,
but
it
is
placed
under
the
control
of
an
officer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
ohio
rules
which
were
then
enforced
are
said
out
on
pages
41
to
45
of
the
government’s
brief
and
i
would
call
attention
to
what
they
were
and
the
complete
change
between
that
and
the
present
rules.
this
appears
on
page
43
in
the
appendix
b
to
the
government’s
brief
under
the
heading,
f,
weapons,
“when
all
other
means
have
failed
or
chemicals
are
not
readily
available,
you
are
armed
with
a
rifle
and
have
been
issued
live
ammunition.”
now,
that’s
pretty
much
encouragement
i
should
think.
the
following
rules
apply
in
the
use
of
fire
arms:
one,
rifles
will
be
carried
with
a
round
in
the
chamber,
in
the
safe
position.
they
are
to
carry
loaded
weapons.
exercise,
care,
and
be
safety
minded
at
all
times.
well,
there
is
not
much
suggestion
about
safety
as
to
the
other
people.
and
then
i
will
skip
over
to
the
--
well,
two,
indiscriminate
firing
of
weapons
is
forbidden;
only
single
aim
shot
at
confirmed
targets
will
be
employed.
potential
targets
are,
and
then
i
will
turn
to
c
at
the
top
of
the
page
44.
“in
any
instance
where
human
life
is
in
danger
by
the
foreseeable
violent
action
of
a
rioter
or
and
it’s
or
when
rioters
to
whom
the
riot
act
has
been
read
cannot
be
dispersed
by
any
other
reasonable
means
then
shooting
is
justified.”
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
i
am
to
have
some
of
mr.
martin’s
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
he
had
some
left.
now,
in
december
1970,
some
seven
months
following
the
shooting
at
kent
state,
the
ohio
national
guard
issued
a
new
operational
plan
which
adopted
the
army
use
of
force
rules
verbatim.
now,
this
appears
on
orders
of
the
adjutant
general
of
ohio,
which
have
been
filed
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
i
think
that
such
orders
ought
to
have
the
status
of
regulations
and
ought
to
be
capable
of
being
taken
judicial
notice
out
by
the
court.
and
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
legal
position
or
it
seems
to
me
that
first,
we
have
a
good
old
question
quite
apart
from
political
question,
quite
apart
from
the
standing,
simply
of
equitable
jurisdiction.
the
only
prayer
in
this
complaint
is
for
equitable
jurisdiction
and
this
appears
on
page
10,
wherefore
plaintiff's
request
that
this
court
enter
judgment
as
follows:
(a)
enjoining
defendant
roll;
(b)
enjoining
defendant
rule;
(c)
enjoining
defendant
rule;
(d),
enjoining
defendants
and
their
successors,
and
finally
(e)
declaring
a
section
of
the
ohio
revised
code
to
be
unconstitutional
and
void.
that
is
a
declaratory
judgment,
but
the
court
below
decided
that
against
the
respondents
here
and
they
did
not
file
any
petition
and
it
is
not
before
the
court.
now,
i
recognize
that
one
isn’t
completely
bound
by
the
prayer,
but
there
isn’t
a
slightest
doubt
that
this
suit
was
not
brought
and
cannot
be
brought
because
of
the
harm
that
was
done
to
any
one
at
kent
state
in
1970.
this
is
not
a
tort
suit
and
there
would
not
be
federal
jurisdiction
of
this
case
as
a
tort
suit,
but
there
is
no
basis
for
this
suit
except
as
a
suit
to
enjoin
a
violation,
a
threatened
violation
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
mere
showing
that
there
was
an
event,
once
in
the
past
that
does
not
provide
a
basis
for
equitable
jurisdiction.
a
recent
case
which
is
fairly
close
to
that
is
laird
and
tatum.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
prayer
for
a
declaratory
judgment
except
with
respect
to
this
one
section
of
the
ohio
statute
which
they
lost
below
and
did
not
seek
to
bring
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
find
that
considerable
to
--
well,
sub-paragraph
f
is
such
other
and
further
--
granting
such
other
and
further
relief
as
this
court
deems
just
and
proper
and
i
assume
that
this
court
will
grant
such
further
relief
as
it
deems
just
and
proper.
i
don’t
think
that
really
adds
to
the
scope
of
the
claim
which
is
solely
for
an
injunction
and
i
also
have
considerable
feeling
that
the
same
rules
as
to
equitable
jurisdiction
are
applicable
to
a
declaratory
judgment
which
is
really
a
kind
of
injunction
which
doesn’t
have
quite
the
immediate
tithe
that
an
injunction
has,
but
it
is
res
judicata
and
you
can
then
come
in
and
apply
to
the
court
for
an
order
to
comply
with
it.
something
was
done
at
kent
state
which
was
unfortunate.
a
firm
action
was
taken
to
correct
the
regulations
and
instructions
and
training
of
the
ohio
national
guard.
this
may
well
have
been
due
to
federal
influence,
though
that
does
not
appear
affirmatively
in
the
record.
in
this
situation,
it’s
my
contention
that
it’s
not
appropriate
for
the
courts
to
intervene
and
undertake
to
prescribe
or
supervise
the
training
of
the
national
guard.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
is
the
court
limited
to
the
new
regulation?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
the
propriety
of
equitable
relief,
it
was.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
certainly
not.
i
don’t
approve
of
the
old
ones
and
i
gather
that
neither
does
ohio
now,
but
that
leads
me
to
the
next
question,
the
question
of
standing.
the
respondents
here
would
appear
to
have
no
personal
standing.
they
weren’t
injured
at
kent
state.
i’m
advised
that
they
are
no
longer
students
of
kent
state.
that
would
appear
from
the
offices
they
held
in
the
lapse
of
merely
three
years.
they
purport
to
bring
the
suit
as
a
class
action.
there
is
at
least
a
problem
as
to
whether
a
class
action
can
be
maintained
by
persons
who
are
no
longer
members
of
the
class.
they
allege
that
a
wrong
was
committed
in
may
1970,
but
they
do
not
sue
because
of
the
wrong,
and
the
district
court
below
would
not
have
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
based
on
that
wrong.
because
of
the
one
event,
they
say
that
their
rights
are
threatened,
but
their
claim
of
future
harm
is
wholly
speculative.
they
base
their
claim
upon
the
single
incident
at
kent
state
in
may
1970
and
ignored
the
substantial
revisions
that
have
since
been
made.
there
is
here
no
ongoing
event
or
program
which
the
respondents
will
inevitably
confront.
they
allege
merely
that
such
an
event
may
occur
at
some
unspecified
time
in
the
unstated
future.
now
courts
of
equity
should
not
exercise
their
injunctive
power
at
large
in
the
absence
of
a
more
specific
threat
of
potential
harm
than
is
alleged
here.
indeed,
the
case
is
here
in
a
rather
odd
and
highly
artificial
posture.
the
sole
relief
here,
claimed
is
prospective,
equitable,
and
injunctive.
but
(1)
the
plaintiffs
are
no
longer
students;
(2)
the
original
defendants
are
no
longer
in
office.
there
is
a
new
governor,
a
new
adjutant
general,
both
of
whom
have
made
it
plain
that
they
do
not
support
the
rules
upon
which
action
was
taken
before.
i
will
remember
when
in
filing
a
motion
to
substitute
new
government
officers,
you
had
to
get
a
declaration
from
them
as
to
whether
they
propose
to
continue
to
follow
the
same
policy.
now,
we
do
it
automatically
as
a
matter
of
course
which
is
probably
an
improvement,
but
it’s
perfectly
plain
that
the
present
officers
against
to
whom
the
injunction
is
sought
do
not
propose
to
follow
the
same
policy.
the
training
regulations
have
been
changed
and
the
statute
as
to
which
a
declaratory
judgment
was
sought
has
been
repealed.
much
of
the
talk
in
the
respondents’
brief
is
about
the
wrongs
that
the
governor
and
the
adjutant
general
did,
but
this
is
not
a
tort
suit.
it
is,
as
i
have
said,
solely
a
suit
for
an
injunction.
to
proceed
with
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
just
to
make
it
a
sort
of
phantom
case
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
when
i
have
more
time
available,
i
may
try
to
write
an
article
about
phantom
cases
in
the
supreme
court.
for
example,
bivens
decided
two
years
ago
was
a
phantom
case.
the
actual
facts
there
bear
no
relation
to
the
issue
which
was
decided
by
the
court
and
similarly,
last
term,
mandel
was
a
phantom
case
for
we
knew
facts
which
were
not
in
the
record,
which
made
it
a
very
different
case
than
it
was.
these
arise
because
people
filed
motions
to
dismiss
and
the
lower
courts
as
the
quickest
way
to
get
rid
of
a
case
and
it
seems
to
me
perhaps
doubtful
and
perhaps
questionable
under
the
case
and
controversy
standard
of
the
constitution
of
whether
the
court
should
undertake
to
decide
issues
in
cases
which
have
become
so
removed
from
reality
as
this
one
has.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
thank
you,
mr.
justice,
i’ll
be
glad
to
add
that
to
my
notes.
my
notes
have
largely
been
based
on
cases
through
my
office
and
i
will
look
for
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
accordingly
we
[laughter]
--
mr.
justice,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
would
[laughter]
i
would
like
them
very
much
and
i
will
give
credit
in
a
footnote.[laughter]
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
with
directions
that
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
