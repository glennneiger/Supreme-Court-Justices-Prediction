--
this
morning
in
71-1553,
gilligan
against
morgan.
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
was
no
standing,
you
wouldn’t
have
to
reach
all
of
those
questions,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
avoid
these
important
constitutional
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
student
in
another
state,
in
another
university
where
the
regulations
governing
the
national
guard
were
the
same
as
existent
at
the
time
of
the
kent
state
episode?
will
they
have
standing
on
the
theory
of
the
respondents?
perhaps
i’ll
ask
your
friend
to
address
himself
to
that
later
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
geltner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
along,
i
have
learned
a
little
bit
and
relating
it
to
the
relief
that
you
were
seeking,
mr.
geltner.
suppose
there
had
been
no
appeal
here,
this
is
obviously
hypothetical,
no
appeal
here
and
you
had
gone
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
after
hearings,
taking
expert
testimony
and
what
not,
had
decreed
a
set
of
rules
for
the
national
guard,
which
for
the
same
as
those,
essentially
the
same
as
those
which
are
now
enforced
by
virtue
of
the
army
regulations.
would
you
think
that
was
the
kind
of
relief
that
would
be
appropriate
for
a
court
of
equity
to
give
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
more
would
you
want
beyond
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
there
some
beyond
the
army
regulations
that
you
would
seek
in
the
district
court
if
you
go
back
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
satisfy
you
if
a
court
of
equity
ordered,
irrevocably
ordered
the
state
of
ohio
to
maintain
the
army
rules
and
force?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
new
ones,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
have
standing
and
if
this
is
a
justiciable
question
and
all
the
other
barriers
are
satisfied
and
the
state
of
ohio
went
back
to
its
old
rules,
couldn’t
you
always
on
your
theory
start
a
new
suit
in
equity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
district
judge
concluded
either
that
there
was
no
standing
or
that
there
was
no
justiciable
question
presented
or
that
the
issue
was
moot
or
all
three,
then
he
should
not
take
any
evidence,
should
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
a
fair
characterization
of
your
position
that
if
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
you
do
not
quarrel
with
the
specific
regulations
now
enforced,
that
(a)
you
want
them
made
permanent
and
(b)
you
want
a
continuing
surveillance
to
see
that
they
are
carried
out,
is
that
fair
statement
of
your
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
geltner.
does
the
petitioner
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
