the

declaratory
relief
only,
isn’t
it?
justice

stewart
that
is
proper
in
the
view
of
the
court?
justice

and
there
is
no
--
was
there
ever
here
in
action
for
a
damages
as
result
of
what
happened
at
kent
state
in

of
1970?
justice

but
this
lawsuit
doesn’t
involve
anything,
any
damages
for
what
happened
there.
it’s
directed
to
the
future
entirely.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
about
it
right
now?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
line
of
cases
are
you
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
is
no
state
--
there
is
not
state
that
doesn’t
[voice
overlaps]
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
adopted
since
may
of
1970?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
write
that
article,
have
in
mind
robinson
against
california?[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
he
says
on
the
top
of
page
18
in
the
language
that
my
brother
powell
has
just
referred
to,
he
says,
the
question
which
we
think
these
paragraphs
serve
to
pose,
that’s
all
the
paragraphs,
a,
b,
c,
d
and
then
he
is
in
this
–
and
he
makes
--
and
your
summary
of
his
understanding
of
all
the
paragraphs.
i
have
thought
and
i
understood
and
i
gather,
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
of
understood
that
what
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
and
all
that
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
was
this
question
summarized
here
by
judge
edwards
in
his
opinion
on
page
18,
am
i
wrong
about
that,
you
say
there
is
three
other
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
three
other
questions,
four
in
all.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
district
court
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
were
defined
from
the
facts
developed
before
it,
that
an
affirmative
answer
should
be
made
to
the
summary
question
previously
raised
in
this
opinion.
then
on
21
as
to
this
phase
of
the
complaint,
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
in
(inaudible).
now,
i
can
certainly
understand
why
you
would
--
why
those
other
things
that
are
--
those
other
italicized
language
is
that
--
seem
very
relevant,
but
i
thought
the
issue
was
limited
here
since
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
no
opinion
in
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
threshold
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
mr.
geltner
and
you
told
me
if
i
misunderstood
you
to
answer
the
question,
my
brother
marshall
just
asked
you
a
while
ago
and
the
question
was
phrased
in
somewhat
different
way
by
the
chief
justice
that
assuming
we
get
over
all
these
and
that
you
are
right
that
these
threshold
issues
are
not
obstacles
and
we
get
over
and
get
to
the
mass,
that
you
really
wouldn't
be
satisfied
by
even
then,
by
an
order
of
a
court
putting
in
permanently
the
present
directors
to
the
national
guard
because
while
that
might
be
alright
on
paper,
your
concern
with
the
actual
pattern
of
training,
isn't
that
what
you
said
to
the
chief
justice?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
you
would
say
that
the
district
court
has
to
get
out
there
every
week
for
two
hours
and
watch
the
people
drill
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
counsel
going
to
know
without
getting
out
there
in
the
national
guard
on
their
weekends
of
training,
or
is
the
court
to
send
the
master
out
there?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
this
going
to
be
done?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
was
just
a
little
curious,
i
am
a
little
curious
as
to
how
it
is
that
the
court
or
you
as
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
or
the
plaintiffs
as
individually,
any
members
of
the
class
can
really
know
what
the
content
is
of
the
training
when
the
national
guard
goes
on
its
training
weekends,
unless,
the
court
sends
a
master
or
referee
out
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
that
what
you
think
would
be
required?
justice
potter
stewart
otherwise,
all
you
would
have
would
be
something
on
paper
that
you
say
is
insufficient?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
other
way
would
be
there?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
justice
potter
stewart
would
the
district
court
would
be
an
expert?
justice
potter
stewart
the
relief
requested
is
injunctive

isn’t
it?
justice
potter

is
