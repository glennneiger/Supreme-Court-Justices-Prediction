mr.
thomas
v.
martin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
propriety
of
the
training,
weapons
and
orders
should
be
determined
by
the
federal
court
or
by
the
other
branches
of
the
federal
government.
another
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
injunctive
relief
against
the
use
of
the
national
guard
or
against
the
use
of
certain
training,
weapons
or
equipment
of
the
guard
would
constitute
an
unwarranted
interference
with
a
legitimate
activity
of
a
state.
this
case
arose
of
the
use
of
the
national
guard
to
control
civil
disorders
which
occurred
at
kent
state
university
in
may
of
1970.
the
respondents
filed
suit,
the
following
fall
claiming
that
the
governor
had
prematurely
called
the
guard
to
duty,
that
the
conduct
of
the
guard
while
on
duty
at
kent
state
violated
the
student's
constitutional
rights
and
that
section
5923.55
which
provides
under
limited
circumstances
immunity
for
members
of
the
national
guard
was
unconstitutional.
respondents
also
claimed
that
the
continuance
of
the
same
operating
methods
and
procedures
of
the
national
guard
under
the
continued
direction
of
defendants
constituted
a
threat
of
repetition
of
injury
in
the
future.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
affirmed
the
district
court
in
its
dismissal
of
two
causes
of
action.
however,
it
found
that
the
complaint
did
state
a
claim
with
respect
to
the
following
question.
whether
there
was
and
is
a
pattern
of
training,
weaponry,
and
orders
of
the
national
guard
which
requires
or
makes
inevitable
the
use
of
a
lethal
force
in
controlling
civil
disorders
where
such
force
is
not
reasonably
necessary.
petitioners
who
are
the
successors
in
office
to
defendants
below
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
to
review
the
portion
of
a
judgment
which
reversed
the
district
court.
the
issue
as
framed
by
the
court
of
appeals
will
require
the
court
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
training,
weapons
and
orders
of
the
national
guard.
the
resolution
of
this
issue
has
been
committed
to
the
other
branches
of
the
federal
government.
petitioners
therefore
contend
that
this
issue
presents
a
non-justiciable
political
question.
all
of
the
factors
or
formulations
which
this
court
has
said,
may
describe
a
political
question
are
involved
herein.
there
is
a
demonstrable
constitutional
commitment
of
the
issue
to
congress.
article
1,
section
8
of
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
power
to
provide
for
the
training
and
equipment
of
the
national
guard.
the
congress
pursuant
to
this
power
has
enacted
legislation
which
prescribes
the
proper
training,
weapons
and
orders
for
the
national
guard.
congress
has
also
enacted
legislation
which
delegates
to
the
president,
the
authority
to
prescribe
regulations
and
issue
orders
concerning
these
matters.
the
president
has
also
acted
pursuant
to
his
authority
and
has
prescribed
mandatory
riot
control
training
requirements
for
the
national
guard.
any
relief
which
the
district
--
which
a
federal
court
could
give
would
express
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
coordinate
branches
of
the
government.
both
congress
and
the
president
have
the
authority
and
the
responsibility
to
determine
the
proper
methods
of
training
and
equipping
the
national
guard.
any
judicial
relief
which
would
control
these
matters
would
therefore
indicate
a
lack
of
respect
by
the
court
for
these
coordinate
branches
to
carryout
their
responsibilities.
any
judicial
relief
which
controlled
the
training,
weapons
or
orders
of
the
national
guard
would
also
run
the
risk,
create
the
risk
of
conflicting
pronouncements
by
the
various
departments
on
the
same
subject.
both
congress
and
the
president
have
acted
pursuant
to
their
authority
in
the
past.
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
they
will
not
again
so
act
in
the
future.
any
judicial
relief
as
to
these
matters
might
create
varying
or
even
conflicting
directives
with
future
directives
from
either
congress
or
the
president.
these
conflicting
directives
could
cause
confusion
and
delay
responding
to
the
civil
disorders.
this
delay
could
impede
the
ability
of
the
state
to
control
the
disorders.
the
proper
method
of
training
and
equipping
the
national
guard
and
preparing
them
to
carryout
their
responsibilities
should
be
made
by
congress
or
the
president
and
not
by
the
court.
the
relief
requested
by
respondents
herein
shows
the
need
for
expertise
and
specialized
knowledge.
the
respondents
have
requested
that
the
use
of
the
national
guard
to
control
disorders
be
enjoined
until
it
is
determined
that
the
training
of
the
members
of
the
national
guard
is
competent
and
that
they
have
been
provided
with
the
best
available
nonlethal
equipment.
there
is
no
ready
criteria
or
standard
for
a
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
training
is
competent
and
whether
or
not
the
equipment
is
the
best
available.
the
department
of
the
army,
because
of
its
experience
in
the
area
is
better
able
to
determine
the
amount
of
training
that
such
troops
need
and
the
type
of
training.
the
department
of
the
army
is
also
more
likely
to
have
knowledge
of
new
developments
in
theories,
in
methods
on
controlling
civil
disorders
and
to
have
knowledge
of
new
developments
and
new
equipment.
it
is
also
better
able
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
such
techniques
and
equipment
not
only
because
of
its
experience,
but
because
it
has
facilities
whereby
the
techniques
and
equipment
maybe
tested
under
simulated
riot
conditions.
in
addition,
a
court
cannot
provide
a
continuing
supervision
and
revision
of
the
training
and
weapons
of
the
national
guard
which
is
necessary
to
properly
prepare
them
to
perform
their
functions.
the
court
is
limited
and
must
wait
for
litigants
to
bring
a
case
or
controversy
in
order
for
it
to
make
its
determination.
petitioners
also
contend
that
the
relief
requested
herein
would
be
an
unwarranted
interference
with
a
vital
activity
of
the
state,
preparation
for
and
control
civil
disorders.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
main
relief
is
to
enjoin
the
use
of
the
national
guard
until
it
is
determined
that
the
training,
weapons
and
orders
are
proper.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
none
in
this
suit,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
are
various
suits
pending
for
actions
which
involve
what
occurred
at
kent
state.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes
your
honor,
we
contend
that
no
type
of
relief
is
warranted.
petitioners
are
particularly
concerned
with
the
relief
requested
which
would
enjoin
the
use
of
the
national
guard
until
a
court
had
determined
the
propriety
of
their
training,
weapons,
and
orders.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor,
petitioners
--
petitioner's
interest
in
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
limited
to
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
would
have
the
same
disruptive
effect
upon
the
use
of
the
national
guard
as
an
injunction.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
would
eliminate
all,
that
is
right
your
honor.
that’s
our
position.
our
position
is,
if
it
is
not
a
political
question,
even
if
it
is
not
a
political
question,
we
do
not
believe
that
injunctive
relief
against
either
the
use
of
the
national
guard
or
which
would
specify
certain
training,
weapons,
and
orders
is
warranted.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
we
do
not.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
it
is
open.
the
court
below
expressly
reserved
that
question
for
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
part
of
it,
your
honor,
is
we’ve
--
since
we
failed
to
do
it
below,
we
may
not
have
realized
that
we
could
have
and
we
believed
that
even
if
plaintiffs
or
respondents
did
have
standing,
there
was
still
no
relief
which
could
be
granted.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
it
is
a
threshold
question
and
it
maybe
we
should
have
raised
that
issue
but
we
didn’t.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
alright,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
respondents
were
even
students
at
the
time
the
disorders
occurred.
the
complaint
was
filed
the
following
fall.
the
plaintiffs
at
that
time
contended
they
were
students
and
sought
injunctive
relief.
we
also
believe
that
any
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
injunctive
relief
is
now
moot.
plaintiffs
or
respondents
base
their
claim
for
injunctive
relief
in
a
continuing
threat
of
injury
on
the
continuance
for
the
same
rules
and
operating
procedures
of
the
national
guard
under
the
continued
supervision
and
direction
of
the
defendants.
neither
condition
now
obtains.
the
rules
of
conflict
or
rules
of
engagement
of
the
ohio
national
guard
have
been
changed
and
ohio
has
now
adopted
the
federal
rules
of
engagement.
none
of
the
defendants
who
were
in
control
of
the
national
guard
at
the
time
of
the
kent
state
disorders
now
have
any
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
national
guard.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
it
was
changed
by
--
i’m
not
sure
of
the
proper
term
of
it;
a
directive
or
order
of
the
adjutant
general.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor,
the
only
way
it
may
show
it
is
we
filed
a
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
which
contained
these
rules.
the
title
is
“a
plan
to
for
control
of
civil
disorders.”
we
filed
a
copy
of
that
with
our
memorandum
suggesting
mootness.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
as
i
construe
their
complaint,
your
honor,
they
claim
a
different
interest
in
that
they
are
students
and
the
national
guard
could
again
be
called
to
the
university;
to
kent
state
university
to
control
disorders.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
i’m
sure
he
could
better
address
himself
to
that,
your
honor.
the
petitioners
contend
that
the
same
considerations
which
required
denial
of
injunctive
relief
against
the
governor
from
prematurely
calling
the
guard
to
duty
should
also
require
denial
of
injunctive
relief
against
the
use
of
the
national
guard
until
there
is
a
judicial
determination
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
training,
weapons,
and
orders.
in
order
to
control
civil
disorders,
the
state
must
be
able
to
act
immediately.
if
it’s
required
to
await
a
judicial
determination,
before
it
can
act,
the
harm
could
be
prevented,
could
occur
without
any
opposition.
petitioners
also
contend
that
any
relief
which
would
require
or
prohibit
the
use
of
certain
training,
weapons,
or
orders
of
the
national
guard
would
also
unduly
impair
the
ability
of
the
state
to
prepare
for
and
control
disorders.
no
one
can
predict
the
time,
place,
size,
or
type
of
disorders
and
no
one
can
predict
what
measures
will
be
necessary
to
control.
the
state
officials
must
therefore
be
given
broad
discretion
to
prepare
for
any
eventuality
and
the
state
officials
must
also
be
given
broad
discretion
to
determine
under
emergency
conditions
just
what
methods
or
techniques
should
be
used
to
control
the
disorder.
any
relief
by
a
court
which
would
control
the
training
or
weapons
or
orders
of
the
court
would
restrict
this
discretion
and
thereby
impair
their
ability
to
prepare
for
and
control
disorders.
we
believe
the
instant
case
is
readily
distinguishable
from
the
cases
relied
upon
by
respondents
and
cited
by
the
court
below
which
granted
injunctive
relief
against
illegal
police
activity.
none
of
those
cases
required
the
court
to
review
the
training,
weapons,
or
orders
of
the
police
department.
none
of
those
cases
enjoined
or
required
the
use
of
certain
training,
weapons,
or
orders.
the
injunctive
relief
in
those
cases
was
very
narrow.
it
was
limited
to
conduct
which
could
not
be
constitutional
or
cannot
be
valid
under
any
circumstances.
there
was
therefore
a
little
risk
that
injunctive
relief
would
inhibit
beneficial
and
lawful
police
conduct
as
well
as
unconstitutional
police
conduct.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
hague
versus
cio,
your
honor,
and
the
case
is
where
a
federal
court
has
granted
injunctive
relief
against
certain
conduct
of
a
police
department.
in
the
instant
case
on
the
other
hand,
the
training,
weapons
and
orders
of
the
national
guard
are
not
illegal
in
themselves
and
not
illegal
under
any
circumstances.
the
basis
for
the
claim
that
they
maybe
illegal
or
maybe
unconstitutional
is
that
alleged
unconstitutional
conduct
by
the
guard
resulted
therefrom.
injunctive
relief
against
the
training,
weapons,
or
orders
of
the
national
guard
could
therefore
also
inhibit
lawful
conduct
by
the
state
and
beneficial
conduct
in
controlling
disorders.
petitioners
contend
that
the
issue
of
the
training,
weapons,
and
orders
of
the
national
guard
has
been
committed
to
the
other
branches
of
the
federal
government
and
that
these
branches
of
the
federal
government
are
better
able
to
deal
with
the
problem.
petitioners,
therefore,
respectfully
submit
that
this
case
presents
a
non-justiciable
political
question.
petitioners
also
contend
that
any
injunctive
relief
which
could
be
granted
against
the
use
of
the
national
guard
or
against
its
training,
weapons,
and
orders
would
constitute
an
unwarranted
interference
with
the
ability
of
the
state
to
protect
itself
against
disorders.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
i
have
nothing
further
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
propriety
of
the
training,
weapons
and
orders
should
be
determined
by
the
federal
court
or
by
the
other
branches
of
the
federal
government.
another
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
injunctive
relief
against
the
use
of
the
national
guard
or
against
the
use
of
certain
training,
weapons
or
equipment
of
the
guard
would
constitute
an
unwarranted
interference
with
a
legitimate
activity
of
a
state.
this
case
arose
of
the
use
of
the
national
guard
to
control
civil
disorders
which
occurred
at
kent
state
university
in
may
of
1970.
the
respondents
filed
suit,
the
following
fall
claiming
that
the
governor
had
prematurely
called
the
guard
to
duty,
that
the
conduct
of
the
guard
while
on
duty
at
kent
state
violated
the
student's
constitutional
rights
and
that
section
5923.55
which
provides
under
limited
circumstances
immunity
for
members
of
the
national
guard
was
unconstitutional.
respondents
also
claimed
that
the
continuance
of
the
same
operating
methods
and
procedures
of
the
national
guard
under
the
continued
direction
of
defendants
constituted
a
threat
of
repetition
of
injury
in
the
future.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
affirmed
the
district
court
in
its
dismissal
of
two
causes
of
action.
however,
it
found
that
the
complaint
did
state
a
claim
with
respect
to
the
following
question.
whether
there
was
and
is
a
pattern
of
training,
weaponry,
and
orders
of
the
national
guard
which
requires
or
makes
inevitable
the
use
of
a
lethal
force
in
controlling
civil
disorders
where
such
force
is
not
reasonably
necessary.
petitioners
who
are
the
successors
in
office
to
defendants
below
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
to
review
the
portion
of
a
judgment
which
reversed
the
district
court.
the
issue
as
framed
by
the
court
of
appeals
will
require
the
court
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
training,
weapons
and
orders
of
the
national
guard.
the
resolution
of
this
issue
has
been
committed
to
the
other
branches
of
the
federal
government.
petitioners
therefore
contend
that
this
issue
presents
a
non-justiciable
political
question.
all
of
the
factors
or
formulations
which
this
court
has
said,
may
describe
a
political
question
are
involved
herein.
there
is
a
demonstrable
constitutional
commitment
of
the
issue
to
congress.
article
1,
section
8
of
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
power
to
provide
for
the
training
and
equipment
of
the
national
guard.
the
congress
pursuant
to
this
power
has
enacted
legislation
which
prescribes
the
proper
training,
weapons
and
orders
for
the
national
guard.
congress
has
also
enacted
legislation
which
delegates
to
the
president,
the
authority
to
prescribe
regulations
and
issue
orders
concerning
these
matters.
the
president
has
also
acted
pursuant
to
his
authority
and
has
prescribed
mandatory
riot
control
training
requirements
for
the
national
guard.
any
relief
which
the
district
--
which
a
federal
court
could
give
would
express
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
coordinate
branches
of
the
government.
both
congress
and
the
president
have
the
authority
and
the
responsibility
to
determine
the
proper
methods
of
training
and
equipping
the
national
guard.
any
judicial
relief
which
would
control
these
matters
would
therefore
indicate
a
lack
of
respect
by
the
court
for
these
coordinate
branches
to
carryout
their
responsibilities.
any
judicial
relief
which
controlled
the
training,
weapons
or
orders
of
the
national
guard
would
also
run
the
risk,
create
the
risk
of
conflicting
pronouncements
by
the
various
departments
on
the
same
subject.
both
congress
and
the
president
have
acted
pursuant
to
their
authority
in
the
past.
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
they
will
not
again
so
act
in
the
future.
any
judicial
relief
as
to
these
matters
might
create
varying
or
even
conflicting
directives
with
future
directives
from
either
congress
or
the
president.
these
conflicting
directives
could
cause
confusion
and
delay
responding
to
the
civil
disorders.
this
delay
could
impede
the
ability
of
the
state
to
control
the
disorders.
the
proper
method
of
training
and
equipping
the
national
guard
and
preparing
them
to
carryout
their
responsibilities
should
be
made
by
congress
or
the
president
and
not
by
the
court.
the
relief
requested
by
respondents
herein
shows
the
need
for
expertise
and
specialized
knowledge.
the
respondents
have
requested
that
the
use
of
the
national
guard
to
control
disorders
be
enjoined
until
it
is
determined
that
the
training
of
the
members
of
the
national
guard
is
competent
and
that
they
have
been
provided
with
the
best
available
nonlethal
equipment.
there
is
no
ready
criteria
or
standard
for
a
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
training
is
competent
and
whether
or
not
the
equipment
is
the
best
available.
the
department
of
the
army,
because
of
its
experience
in
the
area
is
better
able
to
determine
the
amount
of
training
that
such
troops
need
and
the
type
of
training.
the
department
of
the
army
is
also
more
likely
to
have
knowledge
of
new
developments
in
theories,
in
methods
on
controlling
civil
disorders
and
to
have
knowledge
of
new
developments
and
new
equipment.
it
is
also
better
able
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
such
techniques
and
equipment
not
only
because
of
its
experience,
but
because
it
has
facilities
whereby
the
techniques
and
equipment
maybe
tested
under
simulated
riot
conditions.
in
addition,
a
court
cannot
provide
a
continuing
supervision
and
revision
of
the
training
and
weapons
of
the
national
guard
which
is
necessary
to
properly
prepare
them
to
perform
their
functions.
the
court
is
limited
and
must
wait
for
litigants
to
bring
a
case
or
controversy
in
order
for
it
to
make
its
determination.
petitioners
also
contend
that
the
relief
requested
herein
would
be
an
unwarranted
interference
with
a
vital
activity
of
the
state,
preparation
for
and
control
civil
disorders.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
main
relief
is
to
enjoin
the
use
of
the
national
guard
until
it
is
determined
that
the
training,
weapons
and
orders
are
proper.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
none
in
this
suit,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
are
various
suits
pending
for
actions
which
involve
what
occurred
at
kent
state.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes
your
honor,
we
contend
that
no
type
of
relief
is
warranted.
petitioners
are
particularly
concerned
with
the
relief
requested
which
would
enjoin
the
use
of
the
national
guard
until
a
court
had
determined
the
propriety
of
their
training,
weapons,
and
orders.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor,
petitioners
--
petitioner's
interest
in
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
limited
to
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
would
have
the
same
disruptive
effect
upon
the
use
of
the
national
guard
as
an
injunction.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
would
eliminate
all,
that
is
right
your
honor.
that’s
our
position.
our
position
is,
if
it
is
not
a
political
question,
even
if
it
is
not
a
political
question,
we
do
not
believe
that
injunctive
relief
against
either
the
use
of
the
national
guard
or
which
would
specify
certain
training,
weapons,
and
orders
is
warranted.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
we
do
not.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
it
is
open.
the
court
below
expressly
reserved
that
question
for
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
part
of
it,
your
honor,
is
we’ve
--
since
we
failed
to
do
it
below,
we
may
not
have
realized
that
we
could
have
and
we
believed
that
even
if
plaintiffs
or
respondents
did
have
standing,
there
was
still
no
relief
which
could
be
granted.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
it
is
a
threshold
question
and
it
maybe
we
should
have
raised
that
issue
but
we
didn’t.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
alright,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
respondents
were
even
students
at
the
time
the
disorders
occurred.
the
complaint
was
filed
the
following
fall.
the
plaintiffs
at
that
time
contended
they
were
students
and
sought
injunctive
relief.
we
also
believe
that
any
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
injunctive
relief
is
now
moot.
plaintiffs
or
respondents
base
their
claim
for
injunctive
relief
in
a
continuing
threat
of
injury
on
the
continuance
for
the
same
rules
and
operating
procedures
of
the
national
guard
under
the
continued
supervision
and
direction
of
the
defendants.
neither
condition
now
obtains.
the
rules
of
conflict
or
rules
of
engagement
of
the
ohio
national
guard
have
been
changed
and
ohio
has
now
adopted
the
federal
rules
of
engagement.
none
of
the
defendants
who
were
in
control
of
the
national
guard
at
the
time
of
the
kent
state
disorders
now
have
any
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
national
guard.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
it
was
changed
by
--
i’m
not
sure
of
the
proper
term
of
it;
a
directive
or
order
of
the
adjutant
general.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
your
honor,
the
only
way
it
may
show
it
is
we
filed
a
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
which
contained
these
rules.
the
title
is
“a
plan
to
for
control
of
civil
disorders.”
we
filed
a
copy
of
that
with
our
memorandum
suggesting
mootness.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
as
i
construe
their
complaint,
your
honor,
they
claim
a
different
interest
in
that
they
are
students
and
the
national
guard
could
again
be
called
to
the
university;
to
kent
state
university
to
control
disorders.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
i’m
sure
he
could
better
address
himself
to
that,
your
honor.
the
petitioners
contend
that
the
same
considerations
which
required
denial
of
injunctive
relief
against
the
governor
from
prematurely
calling
the
guard
to
duty
should
also
require
denial
of
injunctive
relief
against
the
use
of
the
national
guard
until
there
is
a
judicial
determination
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
training,
weapons,
and
orders.
in
order
to
control
civil
disorders,
the
state
must
be
able
to
act
immediately.
if
it’s
required
to
await
a
judicial
determination,
before
it
can
act,
the
harm
could
be
prevented,
could
occur
without
any
opposition.
petitioners
also
contend
that
any
relief
which
would
require
or
prohibit
the
use
of
certain
training,
weapons,
or
orders
of
the
national
guard
would
also
unduly
impair
the
ability
of
the
state
to
prepare
for
and
control
disorders.
no
one
can
predict
the
time,
place,
size,
or
type
of
disorders
and
no
one
can
predict
what
measures
will
be
necessary
to
control.
the
state
officials
must
therefore
be
given
broad
discretion
to
prepare
for
any
eventuality
and
the
state
officials
must
also
be
given
broad
discretion
to
determine
under
emergency
conditions
just
what
methods
or
techniques
should
be
used
to
control
the
disorder.
any
relief
by
a
court
which
would
control
the
training
or
weapons
or
orders
of
the
court
would
restrict
this
discretion
and
thereby
impair
their
ability
to
prepare
for
and
control
disorders.
we
believe
the
instant
case
is
readily
distinguishable
from
the
cases
relied
upon
by
respondents
and
cited
by
the
court
below
which
granted
injunctive
relief
against
illegal
police
activity.
none
of
those
cases
required
the
court
to
review
the
training,
weapons,
or
orders
of
the
police
department.
none
of
those
cases
enjoined
or
required
the
use
of
certain
training,
weapons,
or
orders.
the
injunctive
relief
in
those
cases
was
very
narrow.
it
was
limited
to
conduct
which
could
not
be
constitutional
or
cannot
be
valid
under
any
circumstances.
there
was
therefore
a
little
risk
that
injunctive
relief
would
inhibit
beneficial
and
lawful
police
conduct
as
well
as
unconstitutional
police
conduct.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
hague
versus
cio,
your
honor,
and
the
case
is
where
a
federal
court
has
granted
injunctive
relief
against
certain
conduct
of
a
police
department.
in
the
instant
case
on
the
other
hand,
the
training,
weapons
and
orders
of
the
national
guard
are
not
illegal
in
themselves
and
not
illegal
under
any
circumstances.
the
basis
for
the
claim
that
they
maybe
illegal
or
maybe
unconstitutional
is
that
alleged
unconstitutional
conduct
by
the
guard
resulted
therefrom.
injunctive
relief
against
the
training,
weapons,
or
orders
of
the
national
guard
could
therefore
also
inhibit
lawful
conduct
by
the
state
and
beneficial
conduct
in
controlling
disorders.
petitioners
contend
that
the
issue
of
the
training,
weapons,
and
orders
of
the
national
guard
has
been
committed
to
the
other
branches
of
the
federal
government
and
that
these
branches
of
the
federal
government
are
better
able
to
deal
with
the
problem.
petitioners,
therefore,
respectfully
submit
that
this
case
presents
a
non-justiciable
political
question.
petitioners
also
contend
that
any
injunctive
relief
which
could
be
granted
against
the
use
of
the
national
guard
or
against
its
training,
weapons,
and
orders
would
constitute
an
unwarranted
interference
with
the
ability
of
the
state
to
protect
itself
against
disorders.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
martin
i
have
nothing
further
your
honor.
