justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
martin,
my
understanding
of
the
general
rule
is
that
the
prayer
for
relief
is
not
a
part
of
the
complaint,
and
therefore,
if
the
district
court
is
going
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
it
would
have
to
conclude
not
only
that
the
particular
relief
sought
is
not
warranted,
but
that
no
conceivable
type
of
equitable
relief
would
be
warranted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
solicitor
general,
when
you
say
only
equitable
relief
was
sought,
are
you
including
within
equitable
relief,
possibility
of
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
sub-paragraph,
f
the
[voice
overlap]
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
asking
them
if
you
say
it
should
be
entered
as
an
order
of
the
district
court
in
the
form
of
declaratory
judgment,
if
that
would
have
be
done,
that
would
require
that
we
decide
all
of
these
constitutional
issues
standing,
justiciability
and
so
forth
i
mean
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
mr.
geltner,
you
would
feel
that
had
not
the
petitioner
here
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
and
succeeded
that
you
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
compile
some
sort
of
a
record.
and
i
know
it
is
not
really
at
your
behest
that
you
are
here
without
any
more
of
a
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
some
motions
to
dismiss
are
obviously
should
be
granted
by
the
federal
rules.
so,
there
will
be
some
cases
that
simply
come
up
on,
on
the
complaint?
