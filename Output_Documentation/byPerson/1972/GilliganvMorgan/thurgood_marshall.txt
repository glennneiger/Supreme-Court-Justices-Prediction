justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
as
i
understand
mr.
martin
correct
that
they
just
adopted
these
federal
standards
while
this
case
was
pending?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
time
when
this
suit
was
filed,
the
complaint
was
as
i
understand
it
that
the
ohio
rules
allowed
them
to
carry
loaded
weapons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
the
suit
was
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
should
we
limit
that
to
the
new
regulation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
wouldn’t
have
to
approve
of
those
old
ones,
would
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
in
any
form
of
(inaudible)
everyone
out
there
was
saying,
you
ask
for
declaratory
injunction
and
then
you
asked
for
the
injunction,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
get
an
injunction,
do
you
need
the
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
properly
drew
your
injunction,
would
you
need
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
asked
for
an
injunction
and
you
claim
is
last
thing,
you
also
want
declaratory
judgment
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you’d
never
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
of
your
clients
are
there
in
school
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
in
the
class
is
now
at
kent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
sought
to
intervene
any
new
plaintiffs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
we
have
now?
don’t
we
need
a
named
plaintiff
with
an
interest
as
of
this
moment
in
order
to
have
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
they
all
drop
dead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
all
the
named
plaintiffs
drop
dead,
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
asked
this
court
to
be
permitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
geltner,
help
me
out
on
this
breaking
up
of
unlawful
assembly.
under
your
ideas
of
what
you
want
who
decides
what
is
lawful
or
unlawful?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
cannot
be
already
under
that
injunction,
now,
the
laws
of
the
land.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
the
governor
and
all
of
his
authorities
have
to
make
the
judgment
as
to
whether
this
is
lawful
or
unlawful,
subject
to
the
contempt
trial
of
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
may
i
carry
on
the
suggestion
of
your
friends
that
what
case
do
you
have
at
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
hague
versus
the
c.i.o.,
which
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
suppose
if
you
were
sitting
as
a
court
and
you
have
an
assembly
of
a
thousand
people,
were
throwing
rocks,
would
that
be
an
unlawful
assembly?
and
before
you
answer,
i
want
to
tell
you,
i
will
ask
you
next
how
many
rocks?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
talking
about
rights
under
ohio
law,
we
are
talking
about
of
very
nice
phrase
called
lawful
assembly
and
what
a
--
lawful
assembly
being
one
in
which
one
rock
was
thrown?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
one
rock
was
thrown,
it
would
be
--
it
would
not
be
protected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
then
the
government
issues
an
order
that
if
anybody
throws
one
rock,
shoot,
you
want
that
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
want
that
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
a
factual
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
far
as
we
know,
it
will
never
occur
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
has
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
any
other
lawful
assembly
occurred
on
kent
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
has
it
been
disturbed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
been
disturbed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
complaint?
why
did
not
you
leave
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
did
you
leave
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
we
have
that
--
what
do
we
have
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
entitles
the
class
and
what
is
the
class
as
of
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
a
different
class
from
when
it
was
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
we
take
a
year
to
decide
it,
it
will
be
still
another
class?
justice
thurgood
marshall
different
persons,
same
class.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
two-thirds
of
what
both
sides
have
told
us,
so
80%
of
things
that
were
not
before
the
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wanted
the
rest
on
the
new
regulations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
satisfy
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
guidelines
do
you
use
for
adequacy
of
the
training?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
know
what
would
be
adequate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
a
district
judge,
who
doesn't
know
a
difference
between
a
bazooka
and
pee
shooter?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
meantime,
the
national
guard
got
all
of
you
all
over
the
lot,
watching
everything
they
do
and
at
the
same
time
they're
trying
to
train
somebody
to
combat?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
officers
in
the
national
guard
have
been
responsible
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
have
all
been
changed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
as
if
now
that
they
are
not
following
the
military
regulations
to
the
letter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
ask
you
to
go
beyond
the
record,
as
your
question.
do
you
know
it
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
hearsay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
that
sort
of
persuades
you
not
to
talk
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
asked
you
to
go
beyond
the
record,
i
am
just
--
that
is
the
trouble
with
this
record.
everything
you
said
since
you
have
been
on
your

is
been

everything,
