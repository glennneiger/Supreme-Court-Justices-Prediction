mr.
william
j.
mulligan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
before
us
two
searches,
a
search
of
a
ford
thunderbird
and
search
of
a
dodge.
in
connection
with
the
search
of
the
ford
thunderbird,
i
think
it
is
imperative
to
consider
some
of
the
additional
facts
surrounding
the
circumstances
of
the
various
searches
that
were
conducted
of
that
automobile.
his
counsel
indicated
on
september
11,
1967
at
10:30
at
night,
that
car
was
involved
in
a
one-car
accident.
mr.
dombrowski,
an
off-duty
chicago
police
officer
summoned
the
sheriff’s
deputies
to
the
accident,
to
come
with
him
to
the
accident
scene.
he
communicated
with
those
officers
during
that
time
period.
he
assisted
them
in
locating
the
accident.
he
told
them
what
his
occupation
was,
told
them
that
there
were
no
other
persons
involved
in
the
accident,
that
he
was
alone
at
the
scene.
he
told
them
three
different
versions
of
how
the
accident
occurred.
he
furnished
them
his
license
and
identification.
the
officers
investigated
that
accident
and
called
the
record.
prior
to
the
removal,
officer
bowdry
searched
through
the
entire
interior
of
the
car.
he
searched
under
the
seat,
in
the
glove
compartment
and
in
the
backseat
of
that
car.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
in
--
in
some
details,
i
think
you’d
have
to
consider
them
to
be
inconsistent,
basically,
he
said
--
i
think
characterizing
this
is
inconsistent,
yes.
the
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
think
the
record
indicates
mr.
chief
justice
that
dombrowski
had
been
drinking
but
it
was
not
until
for
the
first
time
that
the
west
bend
police
station
that
the
record
indicates
that
he
became
in
any
way
uncommunicative
and
it
wasn’t
until
at
2
o’clock
the
following
morning
when
he
was
in
the
west
bend
hospital
that
he
was
unable
to
speak
at
all
and
that
no
prior
time,
at
the
accident
scene
or
at
the
west
bend
sheriffs
department
or
the
police
department
to
the
officers
who
searched
the
car
for
the
gun,
even
asked
mr.
dombrowski
whether
he
was
required
to
have
a
gun
and
whether
he
in
fact
had
such
a
gun
or
where
it
might
be
located.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
officer
weiss
testified
that
he
was
searching
for
the
officers’
service
revolver.
i
don’t
think
the
motivation
is
clear
whether
this
was
a
search
for
some
beneficial
purpose
or
whether
it
was
investigatory
in
nature.
i
think
the
record
could
be
interpreted
either
way
with
respect
to
that.
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record.
at
the
scene,
when
officer
bowdry
made
this
search,
he
locked
the
car
before
it
was
towed
away.
the
car
was
removed
to
a
private
garage
in
kewaskum.
it
was
not
in
police
custody
nor
representative
of
the
sheriff’s
office,
remained
with
the
vehicle.
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record
where
the
keys
to
the
automobile
were.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
think
that
it’s
clear
from
the
record
that
had
the
sheriff’s
department
desire
to
impound
the
car
and
keep
in
safekeeping,
this
thunderbird.
they
would’ve
done
what
they
did
later
on.
they
would’ve
towed
the
car
to
the
sheriff’s
garage.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
and
i
think
that
indicates
that
they
did
have
the
facilities
have
they
desired
to
do
so,
to
safe
keep
it
and
subsequently
with
respect
to
one
of
these
vehicles.
they
parked
it
at
a
county
garage
while
it
was
being
held
to
the
trial.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
correct.
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
any
reason
to
seize
the
vehicle
at
that
time.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
it
is
possible
that
there
could
be
separate
methods
of
operation.
however,
it
is
indicated
in
the
record
that
when
sheriff
howard
went
to
execute
the
search
warrants.
one
was
issued
on
september
12
for
the
dodge
and
then
a
search
warrant
was
issued
on
september
12
for
the
thunderbird.
and
he,
when
he
went
to
search
or
execute
the
search
warrant
for
the
thunderbird
went
to
the
sheriff’s
garage
at
west
bend
to
execute
it.
it’s
only
logical
to
presume
the
interim
of
that
vehicle
after
the
goods,
bloody
articles
were
located,
was
taken
to
the
sheriff’s
garage
at
west
bend,
wisconsin
and
impounded
there.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
i
think
there’s
a
logical
basis
for
treating
them
differently
and
i
think
what’s
indicated
here
by
the
difference
in
the
way
these
cars
were
handled
is
that
in
the
one
case
with
respect
to
the
thunderbird
that
it
was
never
considered
to
be
in
police
custody.
it
was
merely
taken
to
the
private
garage
and
left
there
in
a
locked
condition.
as
opposed
to
the
way
you
would
handle
something
that
was
in
your
custody
where
you’re
maintaining
a
chain
of
control
over
the
article.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
doubt
that
such
evidence
would
normally
be
offered
in
a
drunken
driving
case.
the
fact
that
the
car
has
been
in
an
accident
really
is
an
indicative
of
the
nature
of
the
driving
that
took
place
prior
to
it
and
i
think
it
be
some
question
whether
would
be
material
or
relevant
if
it
had
been
seized
as
evidence
of
that
crime
but
there’s
no
indication
in
the
record
here
that
it
was
seized.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
no.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
i
think
there’s
some
question
whether
it
would
be
--
i
think
the
officers
testifying
as
to
the
location
of
the
car
being
off
the
highway
and
had
left
the
highway
is
probably
as
indicative
of
drunk
driving
as
the
particular
extent
of
damage
that
may
have
occurred
to
the
vehicle
itself.
the
officers
that
left
the
accident
scene
at
11:33
that
night,
they
went
to
the
west
bend
sheriff’s
office.
at
the
west
bend
sheriff’s
office,
mr.
dombrowski
conferred
with
an
assistant
district
attorney
there.
it
wasn’t
until
11:58
that
evening
that
he
was
arrested
for
drunk
driving.
he
was
taken
to
the
west
bend
police
department.
there,
he
was
offered
an
opportunity
to
take
a
breathalyzer
test
but
refused
that
test.
he
was
then
taken
to
the
west
bend
hospital
to
be
treated
for
injuries
that
he
had
sustained
in
the
accident.
at
the
hospital,
he
talked
by
telephone
to
the
doctor
and
it
was
not
until
the
doctor
came
to
the
hospital
at
2
o’clock
that
there
was
any
indication
that
dombrowski
was
uncommunicative.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
he
had
presumably
been
still
drinking
until
the
officers
met
him
at
the
pleasure
inn
in
kewaskum
sometime
after
10:30
that
evening.
he
was
described
in
the
hospital
as
having
blood
upon
him,
possibility
of
nose
bleeding
and
at
one
point,
his
legs
began
shaking
and
his
head
went
back.
i
believe
the
way
it
was
described
in
the
record
by
the
doctor
when
he
testified
and
at
this
point,
he
was
not
able
to
express
himself.
the
doctor
with
the
officers
told,
dombrowski’s
wife
in
chicago
to
see
if
there
were
some
other
explanation
as
to
what
his
condition
could
be
other
than
perhaps
drinking
and
a
nosebleed
from
the
accident.
during
that
conversation,
the
police
officers
did
not
take
the
opportunity
to
inquire
mrs.
dombrowski
as
to
what
she
might
have
known
with
respect
to
the
officer’s
revolver
whether
he
had
it
with
him
or
where
it
might
be
located.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
police
officers
together
with
the
doctor
made
that
call.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
think
that
is
think
is
indicative
--
indicated
in
the
record
that
he
was
seeking
to
see
if
there
was
some
other
medical
reason
for
the
man’s
condition
at
that
time.
after
this,
dombrowski
remained
in
the
hospital,
under
guard
at
all
times,
thereafter.
at
2:13
that
morning,
approximately
four
hours
after
the
time
of
the
accident
and
two-and-a-half
hours,
two-and-a-quarter
hours
from
mr.
dombrowski’s
arrest,
officer
weiss
went
back
from
west
bend
to
kewaskum,
wisconsin
to
the
private
garage,
unlocked
the
car
and
again
searched
the
interior
of
the
vehicle.
he
had
to
unlock
the
trunk
to
look
into
the
trunk
where
he
searched
for
dombrowski’s
gun.
in
the
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
the
record
indicates
that
initially,
officer
bowdry
searched
the
entire
interior
part
of
the
automobile.
he
went
in
the
glove
compartment,
under
the
seat,
in
the
backseat
of
the
vehicle
before
he
locked
it
and
had
towed
away.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
he
was
--
i
believe
that
the
record
at
that
point
is
that
he
was
searching.
weiss
described
the
search
as
a
search
for
the
service
revolver.
it
isn’t
even
clear
from
the
record
whether
at
the
accident
scene
or
at
any
time
prior
to
that
that
dombrowski
himself
was
searched
to
see
if
he
have
the
weapon
on
his
person
and
that
was
noted
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
when
they
considered
this
matter.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
mr.
dombrowski
was
off
duty
at
the
time
and
he
was
not
in
uniform.
perhaps
at
the
hospital
if
he
was
changed
into
hospital
attire,
it
might
have
been
possible
to
note
that
but
i’m
not
so
sure
that
a
service
revolver
could
be
detected
on
an
off-duty
police
officer
wearing
civilian
clothes
and
concealing
it
upon
his
person.
there
never
was
any
consent
by
dombrowski
to
search
the
thunderbird.
that
does
not
appear
when
it
comes
to
the
time
of
the
second
search
of
that
automobile
to
then
anything
additional
that
had
come
to
the
police
attention
that
would’ve
given
them
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle
at
2:13
that
morning.
the
county
court
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don’t
think
that
is
reasonable
conclusion
to
reach
in
a
rural
community
of
--
in
wisconsin
and
the
nature
of
kewaskum,
wisconsin
that
it
became
any
more
target
of
a
break
in
and
perhaps
dombrowski’s
home
in
chicago
where
he
may
well
have
kept
the
service
revolver
and
i
don’t
think
a
fact
that
he
was
in
wisconsin
would’ve
have
given
them
a
right
to
have
his
home
in
chicago
searched
the
possibility.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
i’m
not
sure
that
it
has
never
occurred
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
i
would
agree
with
it.
it’s
less
likely
that
any
risk
to
a
vehicle
in
a
town
of
the
nature
of
kewaskum,
wisconsin
than
there
is
in
chicago
or
new
york
or
any
larger
city.
and
here,
we’re
dealing
with
a
vehicle
that
had
already
been
searched
in
the
interior
and
there
was
nothing
indicative
of
anything
that
would
be
a
target.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
trunk
had
not
been
searched
but
was
locked
and
presumably
is
not
type
of
thing
that
you
could
easily
get
into
without
a
key.
the
county
court
of
fond
du
lac
county
upheld
the
search
of
the
thunderbird
in
part
and
the
basis
that
it
was
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest
for
drunk
driving.
do
you
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
application
of
the
preston
case
that
such
a
search
that
was
conducted
at
a
different
time
and
place
could
not
be
upheld
as
incident
to
the
arrest?
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
it
never
was
found.
when
the
trunk
was
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
pre-trial
motions
were
made
to
suppress
on
a
voir
dire.
an
examination
was
held
at
trial
in
which
those
motions
to
suppress
were
renewed.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
no
such
weapon
was
ever
produced.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
victim
was
shot
and
apparently
beaten
with
some
object.
during
the
closing
arguments,
it
was
even
suggested
that
the
defendant
could’ve
produced
the
gun,
his
own
service
revolver.
as
ballistic
said
--
examinations
had
indicated
that
the
bullet
had
been
riffled
with
six
lands
and
grooves
to
the
left
and
that
evidence
was
offered
that
colt
revolver
such
as
registered
to
the
defendant
had
such
price
lin.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
was
not.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
was
appointed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
motions
to
suppress
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
--
was
made
before
the
trial
court.
that
is
correct
and
preserved
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
--
it
was
alleged
in
the
district
court
petition
that
he
had
pled
not
guilty
to
the
offense
and
there
was
no
confession
here.
there
has
been
no
indication
that
mr.
dombrowski
has
ever
indicated
any
guilt
for
this
crime.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
presumably
the
mo
--
mr.
dombrowski
communicated
with
the
attorney
schlamer
in
the
hospital
room
and
told
him
information
that
a
body
could
be
found
in
the
picnic
area
of
his
brother’s
farm.
but
in
a
writ
of
prohibition
had
been
sought
through
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
to
prohibit
this
disclosure
of
attorney-client
privileged
information
but
that
court
interpreted
that
there
had
been
an
intentional,
a
desire
that
this
information
be
communicated
to
other
sorts.
but
in
your
their
statement
that
there
is
a
body
in
that
farm
is
not
a
confession
that
this
man
is
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
of
murdering
that
person.
we
also
submit
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
vehicle
was
never
a
police
custody.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
of
the
thunderbird.
and
wisconsin
has
no
law
which
would
authorize
authorities
to
take
into
custody
vehicles
that
have
been
involved
in
auto
accidents
or
vehicles
that
had
been
used
a
drunken
driver.
there
are
laws
that
are
enacted
now
in
wisconsin
which
would’ve
permitted
the
impounding
of
vehicles
for
use
in
connection
with
drug
offenses
and
other
matters.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
if
that
was
not
--
not
being
seized
as
evidence
of
that
particular
crime,
it
was
being
impounded
into
police
custody
for
some
other
purpose
such
as
was
the
case
in
cooper
versus
california.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
presumably
it
could
be
but
there
is
no
indication
that
this
car
ever
was
in
involved
here?
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
basically
all
the
materials
found
in
the
thunderbird
were
introduced
consisted
of
a
bloody
nightstick,
consisted
of
a
towel,
consisted
of
a
floor
mat
which
by
expert
testimony
was
later
linked
to
the
floor
mat
in
the
dodge,
a
rule
book,
a
hot
sheet
from
the
chicago
police
department,
some
pants
that
had
some
blood
splattering
on
them.
there
is
enumeration
that
there
were
13
exhibits
that
were
seized
from
the
thunderbird
that
were
all
offered
and
admitted
into
evidence
over
objection.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
no,
i
think
we
have
two
searches
involved
here.
both
of
which
had
a
substantial
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
the
articles
that
were
taken
from
the
dodge
were
also
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
right.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
based
on
the
search
of
the
thunderbird
automobile.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
right
and
the
court
further
on
in
its
opinion
indicated
that
in
the
light
of
the
possibility
of
a
retrial
in
light
of
effect
of
administration
of
justice,
it
expressed
its
opinion
with
respect
to
the
legality.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
think
that
it
was
not
the
actual
decision
of
the
court
and
was
advisory
in
character.
the
court
only
ruled
on
one
aspect
of
the
--
even
at
on
advisory
nature
with
respect
to
the
search
of
the
dodge,
namely
the
search
by
mauer.
there’s
also
a
question
that
was
raised
with
respect
to
the
legality
of
the
search
warrant
that
had
issued
for
the
vehicle
and
the
court
specifically
withheld
expressing
opinion
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
search
warrant
that
was
in
fact
issued.
doing
so
because
it
held
that
the
mauer
search
by
the
state
crime
lab
representative
was
improper
and
therefore
it
didn’t
--
where
the
items
were
seized,
it
did
not
have
reach
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
which
had
been
challenged
as
a
general
warrant
in
the
light
of
the
nature
of
the
failure
to
describe
the
things
particularly
that
were
to
searched
or
seized.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
no,
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
he
did
offer
evidence
during
the
course
of
the
trial
and
there
was
testimony
that
he
submitted
from
family
member.
he
called
police
officers
to
testify
in
connection
with
the
case
but
he
did
not
personally
testify.
the
--
my
comment
that
only
with
respect
to
the
search
of
the
dodge
aspect
to
this
case
that
the
officer
mauer
searched
the
vehicle
was
his
testimony
immediately
after
receiving
the
warrant.
he
went
out
and
he
searched
the
vehicle.
there
was
no
indication
that
he
was
hampered
by
life
conditions.
he
indicated
that
the
time
he
found
bloody
articles
in
the
car.
he
also
indicated
on
his
return
that
he
located
a
tie
away
from
the
vehicle,
some
articles
that
were
located
underneath
of
car,
when
it
was
searched,
matches,
and
straw.
he
testified
on
the
return
of
the
morning
in
september
14th,
he
indicated
what
was
discovered
in
the
search
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
never
indicated
that
the
items
that
have
been
seized
at
that
time
by
mr.
mauer
on
the
following
day
where
anywhere
at
were
all
related
to
that
search
warrant.
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
before
us
two
searches,
a
search
of
a
ford
thunderbird
and
search
of
a
dodge.
in
connection
with
the
search
of
the
ford
thunderbird,
i
think
it
is
imperative
to
consider
some
of
the
additional
facts
surrounding
the
circumstances
of
the
various
searches
that
were
conducted
of
that
automobile.
his
counsel
indicated
on
september
11,
1967
at
10:30
at
night,
that
car
was
involved
in
a
one-car
accident.
mr.
dombrowski,
an
off-duty
chicago
police
officer
summoned
the
sheriff’s
deputies
to
the
accident,
to
come
with
him
to
the
accident
scene.
he
communicated
with
those
officers
during
that
time
period.
he
assisted
them
in
locating
the
accident.
he
told
them
what
his
occupation
was,
told
them
that
there
were
no
other
persons
involved
in
the
accident,
that
he
was
alone
at
the
scene.
he
told
them
three
different
versions
of
how
the
accident
occurred.
he
furnished
them
his
license
and
identification.
the
officers
investigated
that
accident
and
called
the
record.
prior
to
the
removal,
officer
bowdry
searched
through
the
entire
interior
of
the
car.
he
searched
under
the
seat,
in
the
glove
compartment
and
in
the
backseat
of
that
car.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
in
--
in
some
details,
i
think
you’d
have
to
consider
them
to
be
inconsistent,
basically,
he
said
--
i
think
characterizing
this
is
inconsistent,
yes.
the
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
think
the
record
indicates
mr.
chief
justice
that
dombrowski
had
been
drinking
but
it
was
not
until
for
the
first
time
that
the
west
bend
police
station
that
the
record
indicates
that
he
became
in
any
way
uncommunicative
and
it
wasn’t
until
at
2
o’clock
the
following
morning
when
he
was
in
the
west
bend
hospital
that
he
was
unable
to
speak
at
all
and
that
no
prior
time,
at
the
accident
scene
or
at
the
west
bend
sheriffs
department
or
the
police
department
to
the
officers
who
searched
the
car
for
the
gun,
even
asked
mr.
dombrowski
whether
he
was
required
to
have
a
gun
and
whether
he
in
fact
had
such
a
gun
or
where
it
might
be
located.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
officer
weiss
testified
that
he
was
searching
for
the
officers’
service
revolver.
i
don’t
think
the
motivation
is
clear
whether
this
was
a
search
for
some
beneficial
purpose
or
whether
it
was
investigatory
in
nature.
i
think
the
record
could
be
interpreted
either
way
with
respect
to
that.
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record.
at
the
scene,
when
officer
bowdry
made
this
search,
he
locked
the
car
before
it
was
towed
away.
the
car
was
removed
to
a
private
garage
in
kewaskum.
it
was
not
in
police
custody
nor
representative
of
the
sheriff’s
office,
remained
with
the
vehicle.
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record
where
the
keys
to
the
automobile
were.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
think
that
it’s
clear
from
the
record
that
had
the
sheriff’s
department
desire
to
impound
the
car
and
keep
in
safekeeping,
this
thunderbird.
they
would’ve
done
what
they
did
later
on.
they
would’ve
towed
the
car
to
the
sheriff’s
garage.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
and
i
think
that
indicates
that
they
did
have
the
facilities
have
they
desired
to
do
so,
to
safe
keep
it
and
subsequently
with
respect
to
one
of
these
vehicles.
they
parked
it
at
a
county
garage
while
it
was
being
held
to
the
trial.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
correct.
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
any
reason
to
seize
the
vehicle
at
that
time.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
it
is
possible
that
there
could
be
separate
methods
of
operation.
however,
it
is
indicated
in
the
record
that
when
sheriff
howard
went
to
execute
the
search
warrants.
one
was
issued
on
september
12
for
the
dodge
and
then
a
search
warrant
was
issued
on
september
12
for
the
thunderbird.
and
he,
when
he
went
to
search
or
execute
the
search
warrant
for
the
thunderbird
went
to
the
sheriff’s
garage
at
west
bend
to
execute
it.
it’s
only
logical
to
presume
the
interim
of
that
vehicle
after
the
goods,
bloody
articles
were
located,
was
taken
to
the
sheriff’s
garage
at
west
bend,
wisconsin
and
impounded
there.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
i
think
there’s
a
logical
basis
for
treating
them
differently
and
i
think
what’s
indicated
here
by
the
difference
in
the
way
these
cars
were
handled
is
that
in
the
one
case
with
respect
to
the
thunderbird
that
it
was
never
considered
to
be
in
police
custody.
it
was
merely
taken
to
the
private
garage
and
left
there
in
a
locked
condition.
as
opposed
to
the
way
you
would
handle
something
that
was
in
your
custody
where
you’re
maintaining
a
chain
of
control
over
the
article.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
doubt
that
such
evidence
would
normally
be
offered
in
a
drunken
driving
case.
the
fact
that
the
car
has
been
in
an
accident
really
is
an
indicative
of
the
nature
of
the
driving
that
took
place
prior
to
it
and
i
think
it
be
some
question
whether
would
be
material
or
relevant
if
it
had
been
seized
as
evidence
of
that
crime
but
there’s
no
indication
in
the
record
here
that
it
was
seized.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
no.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
i
think
there’s
some
question
whether
it
would
be
--
i
think
the
officers
testifying
as
to
the
location
of
the
car
being
off
the
highway
and
had
left
the
highway
is
probably
as
indicative
of
drunk
driving
as
the
particular
extent
of
damage
that
may
have
occurred
to
the
vehicle
itself.
the
officers
that
left
the
accident
scene
at
11:33
that
night,
they
went
to
the
west
bend
sheriff’s
office.
at
the
west
bend
sheriff’s
office,
mr.
dombrowski
conferred
with
an
assistant
district
attorney
there.
it
wasn’t
until
11:58
that
evening
that
he
was
arrested
for
drunk
driving.
he
was
taken
to
the
west
bend
police
department.
there,
he
was
offered
an
opportunity
to
take
a
breathalyzer
test
but
refused
that
test.
he
was
then
taken
to
the
west
bend
hospital
to
be
treated
for
injuries
that
he
had
sustained
in
the
accident.
at
the
hospital,
he
talked
by
telephone
to
the
doctor
and
it
was
not
until
the
doctor
came
to
the
hospital
at
2
o’clock
that
there
was
any
indication
that
dombrowski
was
uncommunicative.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
he
had
presumably
been
still
drinking
until
the
officers
met
him
at
the
pleasure
inn
in
kewaskum
sometime
after
10:30
that
evening.
he
was
described
in
the
hospital
as
having
blood
upon
him,
possibility
of
nose
bleeding
and
at
one
point,
his
legs
began
shaking
and
his
head
went
back.
i
believe
the
way
it
was
described
in
the
record
by
the
doctor
when
he
testified
and
at
this
point,
he
was
not
able
to
express
himself.
the
doctor
with
the
officers
told,
dombrowski’s
wife
in
chicago
to
see
if
there
were
some
other
explanation
as
to
what
his
condition
could
be
other
than
perhaps
drinking
and
a
nosebleed
from
the
accident.
during
that
conversation,
the
police
officers
did
not
take
the
opportunity
to
inquire
mrs.
dombrowski
as
to
what
she
might
have
known
with
respect
to
the
officer’s
revolver
whether
he
had
it
with
him
or
where
it
might
be
located.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
police
officers
together
with
the
doctor
made
that
call.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
think
that
is
think
is
indicative
--
indicated
in
the
record
that
he
was
seeking
to
see
if
there
was
some
other
medical
reason
for
the
man’s
condition
at
that
time.
after
this,
dombrowski
remained
in
the
hospital,
under
guard
at
all
times,
thereafter.
at
2:13
that
morning,
approximately
four
hours
after
the
time
of
the
accident
and
two-and-a-half
hours,
two-and-a-quarter
hours
from
mr.
dombrowski’s
arrest,
officer
weiss
went
back
from
west
bend
to
kewaskum,
wisconsin
to
the
private
garage,
unlocked
the
car
and
again
searched
the
interior
of
the
vehicle.
he
had
to
unlock
the
trunk
to
look
into
the
trunk
where
he
searched
for
dombrowski’s
gun.
in
the
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
the
record
indicates
that
initially,
officer
bowdry
searched
the
entire
interior
part
of
the
automobile.
he
went
in
the
glove
compartment,
under
the
seat,
in
the
backseat
of
the
vehicle
before
he
locked
it
and
had
towed
away.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
he
was
--
i
believe
that
the
record
at
that
point
is
that
he
was
searching.
weiss
described
the
search
as
a
search
for
the
service
revolver.
it
isn’t
even
clear
from
the
record
whether
at
the
accident
scene
or
at
any
time
prior
to
that
that
dombrowski
himself
was
searched
to
see
if
he
have
the
weapon
on
his
person
and
that
was
noted
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
when
they
considered
this
matter.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
mr.
dombrowski
was
off
duty
at
the
time
and
he
was
not
in
uniform.
perhaps
at
the
hospital
if
he
was
changed
into
hospital
attire,
it
might
have
been
possible
to
note
that
but
i’m
not
so
sure
that
a
service
revolver
could
be
detected
on
an
off-duty
police
officer
wearing
civilian
clothes
and
concealing
it
upon
his
person.
there
never
was
any
consent
by
dombrowski
to
search
the
thunderbird.
that
does
not
appear
when
it
comes
to
the
time
of
the
second
search
of
that
automobile
to
then
anything
additional
that
had
come
to
the
police
attention
that
would’ve
given
them
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle
at
2:13
that
morning.
the
county
court
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don’t
think
that
is
reasonable
conclusion
to
reach
in
a
rural
community
of
--
in
wisconsin
and
the
nature
of
kewaskum,
wisconsin
that
it
became
any
more
target
of
a
break
in
and
perhaps
dombrowski’s
home
in
chicago
where
he
may
well
have
kept
the
service
revolver
and
i
don’t
think
a
fact
that
he
was
in
wisconsin
would’ve
have
given
them
a
right
to
have
his
home
in
chicago
searched
the
possibility.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
i’m
not
sure
that
it
has
never
occurred
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
i
would
agree
with
it.
it’s
less
likely
that
any
risk
to
a
vehicle
in
a
town
of
the
nature
of
kewaskum,
wisconsin
than
there
is
in
chicago
or
new
york
or
any
larger
city.
and
here,
we’re
dealing
with
a
vehicle
that
had
already
been
searched
in
the
interior
and
there
was
nothing
indicative
of
anything
that
would
be
a
target.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
trunk
had
not
been
searched
but
was
locked
and
presumably
is
not
type
of
thing
that
you
could
easily
get
into
without
a
key.
the
county
court
of
fond
du
lac
county
upheld
the
search
of
the
thunderbird
in
part
and
the
basis
that
it
was
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest
for
drunk
driving.
do
you
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
application
of
the
preston
case
that
such
a
search
that
was
conducted
at
a
different
time
and
place
could
not
be
upheld
as
incident
to
the
arrest?
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
it
never
was
found.
when
the
trunk
was
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
pre-trial
motions
were
made
to
suppress
on
a
voir
dire.
an
examination
was
held
at
trial
in
which
those
motions
to
suppress
were
renewed.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
no
such
weapon
was
ever
produced.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
victim
was
shot
and
apparently
beaten
with
some
object.
during
the
closing
arguments,
it
was
even
suggested
that
the
defendant
could’ve
produced
the
gun,
his
own
service
revolver.
as
ballistic
said
--
examinations
had
indicated
that
the
bullet
had
been
riffled
with
six
lands
and
grooves
to
the
left
and
that
evidence
was
offered
that
colt
revolver
such
as
registered
to
the
defendant
had
such
price
lin.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
was
not.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
was
appointed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
motions
to
suppress
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
--
was
made
before
the
trial
court.
that
is
correct
and
preserved
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
the
--
it
was
alleged
in
the
district
court
petition
that
he
had
pled
not
guilty
to
the
offense
and
there
was
no
confession
here.
there
has
been
no
indication
that
mr.
dombrowski
has
ever
indicated
any
guilt
for
this
crime.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
well,
presumably
the
mo
--
mr.
dombrowski
communicated
with
the
attorney
schlamer
in
the
hospital
room
and
told
him
information
that
a
body
could
be
found
in
the
picnic
area
of
his
brother’s
farm.
but
in
a
writ
of
prohibition
had
been
sought
through
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
to
prohibit
this
disclosure
of
attorney-client
privileged
information
but
that
court
interpreted
that
there
had
been
an
intentional,
a
desire
that
this
information
be
communicated
to
other
sorts.
but
in
your
their
statement
that
there
is
a
body
in
that
farm
is
not
a
confession
that
this
man
is
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
of
murdering
that
person.
we
also
submit
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
vehicle
was
never
a
police
custody.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
of
the
thunderbird.
and
wisconsin
has
no
law
which
would
authorize
authorities
to
take
into
custody
vehicles
that
have
been
involved
in
auto
accidents
or
vehicles
that
had
been
used
a
drunken
driver.
there
are
laws
that
are
enacted
now
in
wisconsin
which
would’ve
permitted
the
impounding
of
vehicles
for
use
in
connection
with
drug
offenses
and
other
matters.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
if
that
was
not
--
not
being
seized
as
evidence
of
that
particular
crime,
it
was
being
impounded
into
police
custody
for
some
other
purpose
such
as
was
the
case
in
cooper
versus
california.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
presumably
it
could
be
but
there
is
no
indication
that
this
car
ever
was
in
involved
here?
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
basically
all
the
materials
found
in
the
thunderbird
were
introduced
consisted
of
a
bloody
nightstick,
consisted
of
a
towel,
consisted
of
a
floor
mat
which
by
expert
testimony
was
later
linked
to
the
floor
mat
in
the
dodge,
a
rule
book,
a
hot
sheet
from
the
chicago
police
department,
some
pants
that
had
some
blood
splattering
on
them.
there
is
enumeration
that
there
were
13
exhibits
that
were
seized
from
the
thunderbird
that
were
all
offered
and
admitted
into
evidence
over
objection.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
no,
i
think
we
have
two
searches
involved
here.
both
of
which
had
a
substantial
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
the
articles
that
were
taken
from
the
dodge
were
also
--
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
right.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
based
on
the
search
of
the
thunderbird
automobile.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
that
is
right
and
the
court
further
on
in
its
opinion
indicated
that
in
the
light
of
the
possibility
of
a
retrial
in
light
of
effect
of
administration
of
justice,
it
expressed
its
opinion
with
respect
to
the
legality.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
i
think
that
it
was
not
the
actual
decision
of
the
court
and
was
advisory
in
character.
the
court
only
ruled
on
one
aspect
of
the
--
even
at
on
advisory
nature
with
respect
to
the
search
of
the
dodge,
namely
the
search
by
mauer.
there’s
also
a
question
that
was
raised
with
respect
to
the
legality
of
the
search
warrant
that
had
issued
for
the
vehicle
and
the
court
specifically
withheld
expressing
opinion
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
search
warrant
that
was
in
fact
issued.
doing
so
because
it
held
that
the
mauer
search
by
the
state
crime
lab
representative
was
improper
and
therefore
it
didn’t
--
where
the
items
were
seized,
it
did
not
have
reach
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
which
had
been
challenged
as
a
general
warrant
in
the
light
of
the
nature
of
the
failure
to
describe
the
things
particularly
that
were
to
searched
or
seized.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
no,
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
he
did
offer
evidence
during
the
course
of
the
trial
and
there
was
testimony
that
he
submitted
from
family
member.
he
called
police
officers
to
testify
in
connection
with
the
case
but
he
did
not
personally
testify.
the
--
my
comment
that
only
with
respect
to
the
search
of
the
dodge
aspect
to
this
case
that
the
officer
mauer
searched
the
vehicle
was
his
testimony
immediately
after
receiving
the
warrant.
he
went
out
and
he
searched
the
vehicle.
there
was
no
indication
that
he
was
hampered
by
life
conditions.
he
indicated
that
the
time
he
found
bloody
articles
in
the
car.
he
also
indicated
on
his
return
that
he
located
a
tie
away
from
the
vehicle,
some
articles
that
were
located
underneath
of
car,
when
it
was
searched,
matches,
and
straw.
he
testified
on
the
return
of
the
morning
in
september
14th,
he
indicated
what
was
discovered
in
the
search
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
never
indicated
that
the
items
that
have
been
seized
at
that
time
by
mr.
mauer
on
the
following
day
where
anywhere
at
were
all
related
to
that
search
warrant.
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
mulligan
thank
you.
