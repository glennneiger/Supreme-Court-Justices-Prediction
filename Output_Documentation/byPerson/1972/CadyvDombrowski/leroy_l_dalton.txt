mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
in
habeas
corpus
in
which
the
court
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
granted
dombrowski
the
respondent
a
writ
from
his
imprisonment
in
wisconsin
for
murder
unless
the
state
elects
to
retry
dombrowski.
dombrowski
was
convicted
of
murder
in
1968
in
fond
du
lac
county,
wisconsin.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
which
affirmed
that
a
collateral
attack
was
made
on
that
judgment
in
the
district
court
of
milwaukee.
habeas
corpus
was
denied.
the
case
went
to
the
seventh
circuit.
on
september
9,
1967,
mr.
dombrowski
who
was
an
off-duty
chicago
policeman
drove
his
1960
dodge
automobile
to
his
brother’s
farm
near
kewaskum,
wisconsin.
that
evening,
the
car
became
disabled.
in
the
following
afternoon,
he
had
it
towed
to
his
brother’s
farm.
he
left
it
there
and
returned
to
chicago
with
his
brother
that
day.
at
12:30
a.m.,
the
following
morning,
that’s
september
11,
he
rented
a
1967
red
thunderbird
at
the
o’hare
airport
in
chicago.
at
10:30
that
night,
still
the
11th,
he
was
involved
in
an
accident
near
kewaskum,
wisconsin.
he
called
the
sheriff’s
department
and
two
officers
picked
him
up
in
the
village
of
kewaskum
and
went
to
the
scene
of
the
accident.
he
informed
them
that
he
was
a
chicago
police
officer.
they
found
the
car
off
to
the
highway
and
they
called
for
a
wrecker,
and
officer
bowdry
did
a
cursory
inspection
of
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
to
see
if
his
service
revolver
was
there.
it
was
not.
the
vehicle
was
towed
to
the
garage
at
kewaskum
where
it
was
parked
outside
of
the
garage
and
dombrowski
was
taken
to
the
sheriff’s
office
in
west
bend.
he
was
later
charged
with
drunk
driving,
became
incoherent
and
was
at
the
hospital
being
checked
by
a
doctor,
unable
to
communicate
with
the
doctor.
an
officer
weiss,
the
other
officer
who
had
been
on
the
sheriff’s
department
for
five-and-a-half
months
decided
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
man
was
a
chicago
police
officer,
he
very
likely
had
that
gun
somewhere
in
his
vehicle
and
he
should
go
back
and
look
for
it.
so,
he
drove
back
to
the
unattended
vehicle,
opened
up
the
front
door,
looked
in
the
front
end
and
found
a
book
of
rules
of
the
chicago
police
department.
obviously,
feeling
then
that
he
was
on
the
right
track
because
if
a
man
carries
his
rulebook,
he
probably
has
his
other
paraphernalia
of
his
police
officer
status,
he
opened
the
trunk
still
looking
for
the
gun
but
he
found
bloody
material
including
officer’s
pants,
a
nightstick
covered
with
blood
and
a
tarp,
a
floor
tarp
from
a
dodge
automobile.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
saturated
with
blood.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
was
outside
of
a
filling
station
garage
in
this
small
town.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
had
been
towed
there
and
left
there
outside
of
the
garage
by
the
officers.
the
officers
called
the
tow
operator
and
he
brought
the
vehicle
there.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
it
had
been
locked?
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
from
officer
bowdry.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
was
present
at
the
time
and
made
no
objection.
the
record
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
it
–-
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it’s
something
that
happens
all
the
time
in
our
society
now
where
a
mobile
society
and
we
get
in
trouble
with
automobiles.
in
this
case,
it
was
disabled.
it
can’t
stay
on
the
highway,
it
has
to
go
somewhere.
so,
it
--
and
the
officers
having
the
custody,
so
they
have
to
take
that
vehicle
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
this
was
a
standard
procedure
apparently
in
this
part
of
the
county
where
the
sheriff’s
office
called
this
wrecker
operator
and
had
him
tow
these
cars
to
disabled
cars
to
his
place
until
they
were
properly
taken
care
of,
on
some
way
or
another.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
think
so,
yes.
i
think
it
was
their
responsibility
especially
in
that
hour
of
the
night.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
pardon?
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
don’t
think
that
was
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
they
could
have
--
i
suppose
they
could
have
taken
the
car
right
to
west
bend
to
their
police
station.
i
would
imagine
they
could.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
this
was
a
filling
station
type
operation
where
there
isn’t
room
inside
the
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
assume
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
think
he
was
concerned
and
this
is
of
course
not
in
the
record
because
the
officer
was
not
cross-examined
during
anyone
of
these
five
different
proceeding
to
establish
anything
other
than
his
intention
to
preserve
that
gun
for
that
fellow
officer.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
when?
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
when
he
was
brought
to
the
sheriff.
that’s
when
they
announced
that
he
was
--
they
were
charging
him
with
drunk
driving.
now,
he
was
under
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
technically,
i
suppose,
he
was
under
the
custody
of
the
officers
from
the
time
they
took
him
and
took
his
car
to
the
towing
station
garage.
but
he
wasn’t
charged
with
the
specific
offense
until
they
had
talked
to
the
district
attorney
when
he
was
charged
with
drunk
driving.
when
the
officer
observed
these
bloody
materials,
he
picked
them
out
of
the
trunk.
they
were
still
wet
and
the
tarp
was
basically
was
saturated
with
blood.
he
took
these
materials
back
to
the
sheriff’s
office
and
then
when
dombrowski
was
able
to
communicate,
they
confronted
him
and
he
asked
to
talk
to
an
attorney.
the
attorney
was
brought
in,
conferred
with
dombrowski,
and
later,
the
attorney
went
to
the
district
attorney
who
was
from
the
same
area
and
advised
the
district
attorney
that
if
they
searched
the
dombrowski
farm,
they
would
find
the
body.
so,
the
officers
accompanied
by
one
of
the
attorneys,
an
associate
of
the
attorney
who
had
relayed
the
message,
went
to
the
farm
and
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
they
got
this
from
dombrowski’s
lawyer.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
when
they
had
confronted
dombrowski
with
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
with
the
bloody
materials,
he
asked,
he
didn’t
want
to
speak;
he
wanted
to
talk
to
an
attorney
and
so
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
a
local
lawyer
talked
to
him
and
later
on
came
out
and
advised.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
right,
in
a
hospital.
and
he
advised
the
county
district
attorney
for
washington
county
where
west
bend
is
located
that
there
be
a
body
on
the
dombrowski
farm
which
is
just
across
the
county
line
in
fond
du
lac
county.
so,
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
in
washington
county.
the
village
is
but
the
farm,
the
dombrowski
farm
is
in
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
fond
du
lac
county.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
north,
north
of
kewaskum
and
west
bend.
south
of
fond
du
lac,
fond
du
lac
is
at
the
foot
of
the
lake,
as
the
name
indicates
and
about
half
or
the
third
of
the
way
between
the
oshkosh
and
milwaukee,
generally
speaking.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
knows
that.
this
is
the
area
where
mr.
dombrowski
grew
up.
when
the
party
arrived
at
the
farm,
they
realized
that
they’re
in
fond
du
lac
county,
so
they
contacted
the
fond
du
lac
county
authorities
as
well.
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day,
the
dead
body
of
herbert
mckinney
was
found
on
a
dump,
on
the
family
farm
near
a
picnic
area,
which
was
north
of
the
buildings
and
the
spot
where
the
dodge
vehicle
had
been
parked
the
day
before.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
victim
was
from
chicago.
we
have
no
motive.
we
were
able
to
prove
only
that
they
frequented
the
same
pool
hall
in
chicago.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
think,
reconstructing
the
crime
that
he
brought
mckinney
from
chicago
in
the
thunderbird
because
he
had
rented
the
car
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
the
car
matching
that
description
was
seen
by
the
dodge
somewhere
around
4
o’clock
to
7
o’clock
in
the
morning.
the
pathologist
established
the
time
of
death
as
around
7
a.m.
the
inside
of
the
dodge
automobile
was
saturated
with
blood.
and
one
of
the
socks
which
is
alleged
to
be
a
contaminated
piece
of
evidence
was
in
the
dodge.
the
other
sock
was
out
with
the
body
near
the
dump.
the
--
i
would
think
the
reconstruction
would
go
like
this.
he
took
dombrowski
poss
--
or
he
took
mckinney
possibly
when
he
was
unconscious
out
of
the
thunderbird
into
the
back
seat
of
the
dodge,
killed
him
there,
shot
him
and
the
pathologist
established
and
we
were
able
to
established
the
venue
which
is
a
necessary
element
in
first-degree
murder
in
wisconsin.
the
pathologist’s
testimony
that
he,
in
his
opinion
bled
to
death
in
the
dodge
automobile.
he
took
the
body
out
of
the
dodge
automobile,
put
it
in
the
trunk
of
the
thunderbird,
carried
it
to
few
hundred
yards
over
to
the
dump
area,
pulled
the
body
out
of
the
trunk,
and
dumped
it.
then
at
10:30
that
morning,
he
was
seen
buying
two
towels
at
a
store
in
the
village
kewaskum.
towel
hands
wring,
the
description
of
the
towel
was
among
the
materials
retrieved
from
the
thunderbird.
now,
when
the
body
was
found,
one
of
the
investigating
officers,
the
undersheriff
of
fond
de
lac
county
walked
over
toward
the
farm
village
and
he
saw
this
dodge
automobile
a
known
license
plate.
he
looked
in
the
dodge
and
he
saw
it
was
saturated
with
blood
in
the
backseat
running
over
the
front
of
that
as
he
described.
there
was
blood
on
the
briefcase.
there
was
blood
all
over
the
backseat
area,
he
various
upholster
and
so
on
in
the
head
--
blood.
it
didn’t
take
an
awful
out
of
putting
together
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
possibly
this
dead
body
had
been
in
that
car
because
there
was
hardly
any
blood
left
in
that
body.
it
was
laying
on
the
dump
with
the
head
down
and
the
body
was
white.
the
pathologist
testified
later
on
that
this
body
had
pumped
practically
all
of
the
blood
out
in
an
attempt
to
save
the
life
of
the
individual.
whenever
the
body
is
injured
in
a
vital
area
such
as
the
brain
or
the
heart,
the
rest
of
the
body
works
and
creates
terrific
pressure
to
send
blood
to
that
emergency
area
and
so
you
can
imagine
that
blood
was
spurting
out
of
this
wound
every
time
his
heart
beat.
it
did
that
until
there
was
no
more
blood
to
send.
so,
they
asked
for
a
search
warrant.
they
went
to
the
judge
and
they
said,
we
have
the
body
we
have
the
material
from
the
thunderbird
automobile.among
those
materials
which
were
blood-soak
is
a
man
from
a
dodge
automobile
which
is
saturated
with
blood.
we
have
the
dodge
automobile
on
the
farm
and
then
on
the
backseat
it’s
saturated
with
blood.
we
would
like
to
take
that
vehicle
and
search
it
for
further
evidence
of
this
apparent
murder
and
the
judge
says
yes,
you
do
it.
and
you
impound
the
vehicle
and
then
it
later
became
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
issued
a
search
warrant
for
the
vehicle.
he
also
directed
them
to
impound
the
vehicle
which
is
in
the
record.
the
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
first
one
but
not
the
dodge.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
thunderbird
yes,
but
the
dodge
vehicle
was
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
we’re
talking
about
the
dodge
that,
it
was
on
the
farm.
and
so
the
search
warrant
issued
at
8:15
that
evening.
this
is
september
in
wisconsin.
and
as
the
record
indicates,
it
was
getting
dusk
when
the
crime
laboratory
people
arrived
from
madison
at
7:20.
so,
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
that
at
8:15
it
was
getting
pretty
dark.
the
search
warrant
was
issued,
the
under
sheriff
from
the
others
went
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
got
a
tow
truck
to
haul
to
vehicle
into
fond
du
lac
in
sheriff’s
garage.
now,
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think
made
a
serious
error
in
finding
that
the
under
sheriff
had
executed
the
search
warrant
at
the
farm
when
he
went
out
and
looked
into
the
dodge.
there
was
testimony
that
he
opened
the
door
and
looked
in.
i
think
they
questioned
him
on
a
motion
after
verdict
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
searched
the
vehicle
and
he
said
yes.
no
materials
were
taken
out
of
that
vehicle
at
the
farm
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
trial
record
and
find
out
who
identified
all
of
these
items
and
a
murder
case
where
you
got
a
lot
people
handling
the
various
items
of
evidence,
you
have
to
have
a
chain
of
evidence
proof,
the
chain
of
evidence
firmly
establishes
that
this
mr.
mauer
from
the
crime
laboratory
was
the
first
man
to
take
anything
under
that
dodge
and
that
was
done
while
the
dodge
was
impounded
in
the
sheriff’s
garage
in
fond
du
lac.
now,
there’s
a
direct
quote
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
undersheriff
seized
the
tarp
and
the
sock
in
the
dodge
that
evening.
it
is
not
true.
it
cannot
be
supported
by
any
interpretation
of
this
record.
in
fact,
the
record
is
so
clear
that
everything
was
taken
out
of
that
dodge
at
the
time
of
the
search
on
the
morning
of
the
13th.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
mr.
mauer
from
the
crime
laboratory.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
mr.
mauer
is
an
expert
who
--
we
have
a
crime
laboratory
system
in
our
department
of
justice.
they
go
out
and
help
local
unfortunate
people
on
specialized
things.
the
sheriff
called.
sheriffs
in
small
counties
are
not
experts.
as
we
all
know
from
all
these
search
and
seizure
cases.
we’re
putting
too
much
burden
on
them.
but
mr.
mauer
was
called.
he
was
told
that
there’s
a
search
warrant
and
so
since
the
vehicle
was
impounded,
they
waited
until
the
next
morning
and
conducted
the
thorough
search
because
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
search
in
that
vehicle.
it
was
to
obtain
all
of
the
physical
evidence
of
the
crime
that
were
--
that
was
available.
and
only
an
expert
who
knew
what
take
out
of
the
vehicle
could
decide
that
at
that
time.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor.
when
i
was
preparing
the
appendix,
i
contacted
the
clerk’s
office
in
milwaukee
and
for
some
reason
or
other,
there
was
no
entry
made
in
the
docket
to
show
that
after
a
stipulation
had
been
entered
that
the
record
was
not
brought
to
chicago,
it
did
and
that
letter
was
later
on
sent
to
the
court
and
the
clerk
has
it
now.
so,
i
apologize
for
any
misleading.
it
was
unintentional.
i
thought
i
checked
everything
and
i
went
there
personally
to
see
what
the
record
consisted
of
and
it
was
later
on
when
the
--
mr.
mulligan
was
preparing
his
brief
that
these
records
were
found.
part
of
them
is
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
clerk’s
office
and
part
of
them
in
milwaukee.
but
they
are
here
no,
all
the
record
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
seventh
circuit
asked
for
the
record
to
be
sent
down
there
several
months
after
the
other
--
the
rest
of
the
record
went.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
subsequently,
the
clerk
in
milwaukee
found
a
transmittal
letter.
it
wasn’t
in
this
file,
apparently
in
this
file.
and
the
letter
was
sent
to
this
court
after
the
record
came
down.
it
was
added
to
the
record
here.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
the
court
of
appeals,
i’m
satisfied,
have
the
full
record.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
it
did.
the
return
on
the
warrant
was
made
on
the
14th.
that’s
another
fact
that
the
seventh
circuit
determined
that
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
they
said
that
the
warrant
was
executed
and
a
return
prepared
and
therefore
the
warrant
was
functus
officio.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
what
kind
of
games
are
we
playing?
we
can’t
even
take
a
vehicle
that’s
been
impounded
and
search
it
for
evidence
of
murder
without
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
on
both
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
if
i
may
just
at
the
moment,
the
search
by
officer
weiss,
if
we
want
to
call
the
search,
every
court
has
picked
up
a
new
name
and
we
try
to
stay
away
from
the
word
search
because
we
--
we
really
don’t
know
what
a
search
is.
it
was
done
by
officer
weiss
with
the
intention
of
securing
some
property
of
mr.
dombrowski.
five
different
times,
there
were
fact-finding
hearings
where
this
fact
could’ve
been
refuted
by
mr.
dombrowski
including
a
hearing
before
the
district
court
of
milwaukee
which
he
did
not
avail
himself
of,
so
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
mr.
weiss’
statement
that
he
was
looking
for
the
gun.
he
had
no
knowledge
of
any
other
kind.
he
was
completely
surprised
by
the
evidence
of
murder
which
emerged
when
he
opened
the
trunk.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that’s
right,
your
honor.
the
--
i
think
on
that
point,
that
nowadays
police
officers
are
not
just
law
enforcers.
we
have
millions
of
vehicles
on
the
highway
everyday
and
everywhere
where
you
and
i
drive
our
vehicles,
we
might
force
a
local
law
enforcement
official
to
either
arrest
us
for
violating
the
law,
to
come
to
our
aid
if
we
have
an
accident,
to
come
to
our
aid
if
we
have
a
heart
attack.
in
any
of
a
number
of
circumstances,
a
law
enforcement
officer
may
be
called
upon
to
help
someone
who
is
in
a
vehicle
away
from
his
home.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
should
look
at
what
we
are
calling
now,
i
guess,
inventory
searches,
and
see
whether
or
not
you
can’t
find
some
area
where
a
person
that
gets
out
in
the
highway
with
his
vehicle
doesn’t
leave
behind
a
little
bit
of
that
privacy
that
we
are
so
concerned
about.
it’s
very
difficult
to
play
the
dual
role
of
a
law-enforcement
officer
and
the
helper.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that’s
right.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
and
that
record
is
so
clear
on
that,
that
we
think
that
this
act
of
the
guy
of
sending
that
rookie
police
officer
to
look
after
this
fellow
officer’s
gun
should
not
result
in
the
freeing
of
a
man
who
has
been
convicted
fairly
of
first
degree
murder.
thank
you.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
thank
you
your
honor.
the
reasonableness
of
suspecting
that
someone
may
try
to
get
into
the
trunk
of
the
disabled
automobile
has
been
brought
up
and
the
allegation
by
other
counsel
is
that
in
a
small
town,
you
don’t
have
those
worries.
i
know
a
lot
of
small
town
district
attorneys
that
would
like
to
have
some
proof
of
that
when
they
are
prosecuting
people
for
breaking
open
trunks
and
taking
spare
tires
and
wheels.
and
especially
when
they
see
a
car
disabled
to
modern
state.
how
naïve
are
we?
this
is
1973.
people
move
from
here
to
there
to
everywhere
and
small
towns
are
no
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
pretty
close
to
it,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it’s
on
highway
45
between
milwaukee
and
fond
du
lac.
i
just
like
to
pause
by
saying
that
we’re
not
here
to
determine
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
dombrowski.
he
has
been
found
guilty
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
by
the
proper
courts
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
we
are
here
on
a
collateral
attack
upon
that
judgment
and
what
you
have
to
determine
is
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
punish
two
law
enforcement
people
who
thought
they
were
doing
their
duty
five
years
ago,
five-and-a-half
years
ago.
and
what
your
theory
will
have
to
be
is
that
if
you
free
this
man,
you
will
thereby
have
slapped
those
two
officers
in
the
face.
and
you
would
have
told
them,
don’t
do
it
again
and
you
will
told
other
officers
don’t
do
this.
it
won’t
work.
one
of
the
officers
is
no
longer
in
wisconsin.
i
don’t
know
if
he’s
even
in
law
enforcement.
you
cannot
by
this
method,
satisfy
society’s
needs
to
deal
with
criminals.
and
i
would
urge
that
you
recognize
that
this
man
is
a
convicted
murderer
and
reverse
the
seventh
circuit.
thank
you.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
in
habeas
corpus
in
which
the
court
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
granted
dombrowski
the
respondent
a
writ
from
his
imprisonment
in
wisconsin
for
murder
unless
the
state
elects
to
retry
dombrowski.
dombrowski
was
convicted
of
murder
in
1968
in
fond
du
lac
county,
wisconsin.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
which
affirmed
that
a
collateral
attack
was
made
on
that
judgment
in
the
district
court
of
milwaukee.
habeas
corpus
was
denied.
the
case
went
to
the
seventh
circuit.
on
september
9,
1967,
mr.
dombrowski
who
was
an
off-duty
chicago
policeman
drove
his
1960
dodge
automobile
to
his
brother’s
farm
near
kewaskum,
wisconsin.
that
evening,
the
car
became
disabled.
in
the
following
afternoon,
he
had
it
towed
to
his
brother’s
farm.
he
left
it
there
and
returned
to
chicago
with
his
brother
that
day.
at
12:30
a.m.,
the
following
morning,
that’s
september
11,
he
rented
a
1967
red
thunderbird
at
the
o’hare
airport
in
chicago.
at
10:30
that
night,
still
the
11th,
he
was
involved
in
an
accident
near
kewaskum,
wisconsin.
he
called
the
sheriff’s
department
and
two
officers
picked
him
up
in
the
village
of
kewaskum
and
went
to
the
scene
of
the
accident.
he
informed
them
that
he
was
a
chicago
police
officer.
they
found
the
car
off
to
the
highway
and
they
called
for
a
wrecker,
and
officer
bowdry
did
a
cursory
inspection
of
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
to
see
if
his
service
revolver
was
there.
it
was
not.
the
vehicle
was
towed
to
the
garage
at
kewaskum
where
it
was
parked
outside
of
the
garage
and
dombrowski
was
taken
to
the
sheriff’s
office
in
west
bend.
he
was
later
charged
with
drunk
driving,
became
incoherent
and
was
at
the
hospital
being
checked
by
a
doctor,
unable
to
communicate
with
the
doctor.
an
officer
weiss,
the
other
officer
who
had
been
on
the
sheriff’s
department
for
five-and-a-half
months
decided
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
man
was
a
chicago
police
officer,
he
very
likely
had
that
gun
somewhere
in
his
vehicle
and
he
should
go
back
and
look
for
it.
so,
he
drove
back
to
the
unattended
vehicle,
opened
up
the
front
door,
looked
in
the
front
end
and
found
a
book
of
rules
of
the
chicago
police
department.
obviously,
feeling
then
that
he
was
on
the
right
track
because
if
a
man
carries
his
rulebook,
he
probably
has
his
other
paraphernalia
of
his
police
officer
status,
he
opened
the
trunk
still
looking
for
the
gun
but
he
found
bloody
material
including
officer’s
pants,
a
nightstick
covered
with
blood
and
a
tarp,
a
floor
tarp
from
a
dodge
automobile.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
saturated
with
blood.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
was
outside
of
a
filling
station
garage
in
this
small
town.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
had
been
towed
there
and
left
there
outside
of
the
garage
by
the
officers.
the
officers
called
the
tow
operator
and
he
brought
the
vehicle
there.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
it
had
been
locked?
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
from
officer
bowdry.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
was
present
at
the
time
and
made
no
objection.
the
record
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
it
–-
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it’s
something
that
happens
all
the
time
in
our
society
now
where
a
mobile
society
and
we
get
in
trouble
with
automobiles.
in
this
case,
it
was
disabled.
it
can’t
stay
on
the
highway,
it
has
to
go
somewhere.
so,
it
--
and
the
officers
having
the
custody,
so
they
have
to
take
that
vehicle
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
this
was
a
standard
procedure
apparently
in
this
part
of
the
county
where
the
sheriff’s
office
called
this
wrecker
operator
and
had
him
tow
these
cars
to
disabled
cars
to
his
place
until
they
were
properly
taken
care
of,
on
some
way
or
another.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
think
so,
yes.
i
think
it
was
their
responsibility
especially
in
that
hour
of
the
night.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
pardon?
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
don’t
think
that
was
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
they
could
have
--
i
suppose
they
could
have
taken
the
car
right
to
west
bend
to
their
police
station.
i
would
imagine
they
could.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
this
was
a
filling
station
type
operation
where
there
isn’t
room
inside
the
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
assume
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
think
he
was
concerned
and
this
is
of
course
not
in
the
record
because
the
officer
was
not
cross-examined
during
anyone
of
these
five
different
proceeding
to
establish
anything
other
than
his
intention
to
preserve
that
gun
for
that
fellow
officer.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
when?
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
when
he
was
brought
to
the
sheriff.
that’s
when
they
announced
that
he
was
--
they
were
charging
him
with
drunk
driving.
now,
he
was
under
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
technically,
i
suppose,
he
was
under
the
custody
of
the
officers
from
the
time
they
took
him
and
took
his
car
to
the
towing
station
garage.
but
he
wasn’t
charged
with
the
specific
offense
until
they
had
talked
to
the
district
attorney
when
he
was
charged
with
drunk
driving.
when
the
officer
observed
these
bloody
materials,
he
picked
them
out
of
the
trunk.
they
were
still
wet
and
the
tarp
was
basically
was
saturated
with
blood.
he
took
these
materials
back
to
the
sheriff’s
office
and
then
when
dombrowski
was
able
to
communicate,
they
confronted
him
and
he
asked
to
talk
to
an
attorney.
the
attorney
was
brought
in,
conferred
with
dombrowski,
and
later,
the
attorney
went
to
the
district
attorney
who
was
from
the
same
area
and
advised
the
district
attorney
that
if
they
searched
the
dombrowski
farm,
they
would
find
the
body.
so,
the
officers
accompanied
by
one
of
the
attorneys,
an
associate
of
the
attorney
who
had
relayed
the
message,
went
to
the
farm
and
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
they
got
this
from
dombrowski’s
lawyer.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
when
they
had
confronted
dombrowski
with
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
with
the
bloody
materials,
he
asked,
he
didn’t
want
to
speak;
he
wanted
to
talk
to
an
attorney
and
so
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
a
local
lawyer
talked
to
him
and
later
on
came
out
and
advised.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
right,
in
a
hospital.
and
he
advised
the
county
district
attorney
for
washington
county
where
west
bend
is
located
that
there
be
a
body
on
the
dombrowski
farm
which
is
just
across
the
county
line
in
fond
du
lac
county.
so,
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
in
washington
county.
the
village
is
but
the
farm,
the
dombrowski
farm
is
in
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
fond
du
lac
county.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
north,
north
of
kewaskum
and
west
bend.
south
of
fond
du
lac,
fond
du
lac
is
at
the
foot
of
the
lake,
as
the
name
indicates
and
about
half
or
the
third
of
the
way
between
the
oshkosh
and
milwaukee,
generally
speaking.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
knows
that.
this
is
the
area
where
mr.
dombrowski
grew
up.
when
the
party
arrived
at
the
farm,
they
realized
that
they’re
in
fond
du
lac
county,
so
they
contacted
the
fond
du
lac
county
authorities
as
well.
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day,
the
dead
body
of
herbert
mckinney
was
found
on
a
dump,
on
the
family
farm
near
a
picnic
area,
which
was
north
of
the
buildings
and
the
spot
where
the
dodge
vehicle
had
been
parked
the
day
before.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
victim
was
from
chicago.
we
have
no
motive.
we
were
able
to
prove
only
that
they
frequented
the
same
pool
hall
in
chicago.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
think,
reconstructing
the
crime
that
he
brought
mckinney
from
chicago
in
the
thunderbird
because
he
had
rented
the
car
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
the
car
matching
that
description
was
seen
by
the
dodge
somewhere
around
4
o’clock
to
7
o’clock
in
the
morning.
the
pathologist
established
the
time
of
death
as
around
7
a.m.
the
inside
of
the
dodge
automobile
was
saturated
with
blood.
and
one
of
the
socks
which
is
alleged
to
be
a
contaminated
piece
of
evidence
was
in
the
dodge.
the
other
sock
was
out
with
the
body
near
the
dump.
the
--
i
would
think
the
reconstruction
would
go
like
this.
he
took
dombrowski
poss
--
or
he
took
mckinney
possibly
when
he
was
unconscious
out
of
the
thunderbird
into
the
back
seat
of
the
dodge,
killed
him
there,
shot
him
and
the
pathologist
established
and
we
were
able
to
established
the
venue
which
is
a
necessary
element
in
first-degree
murder
in
wisconsin.
the
pathologist’s
testimony
that
he,
in
his
opinion
bled
to
death
in
the
dodge
automobile.
he
took
the
body
out
of
the
dodge
automobile,
put
it
in
the
trunk
of
the
thunderbird,
carried
it
to
few
hundred
yards
over
to
the
dump
area,
pulled
the
body
out
of
the
trunk,
and
dumped
it.
then
at
10:30
that
morning,
he
was
seen
buying
two
towels
at
a
store
in
the
village
kewaskum.
towel
hands
wring,
the
description
of
the
towel
was
among
the
materials
retrieved
from
the
thunderbird.
now,
when
the
body
was
found,
one
of
the
investigating
officers,
the
undersheriff
of
fond
de
lac
county
walked
over
toward
the
farm
village
and
he
saw
this
dodge
automobile
a
known
license
plate.
he
looked
in
the
dodge
and
he
saw
it
was
saturated
with
blood
in
the
backseat
running
over
the
front
of
that
as
he
described.
there
was
blood
on
the
briefcase.
there
was
blood
all
over
the
backseat
area,
he
various
upholster
and
so
on
in
the
head
--
blood.
it
didn’t
take
an
awful
out
of
putting
together
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
possibly
this
dead
body
had
been
in
that
car
because
there
was
hardly
any
blood
left
in
that
body.
it
was
laying
on
the
dump
with
the
head
down
and
the
body
was
white.
the
pathologist
testified
later
on
that
this
body
had
pumped
practically
all
of
the
blood
out
in
an
attempt
to
save
the
life
of
the
individual.
whenever
the
body
is
injured
in
a
vital
area
such
as
the
brain
or
the
heart,
the
rest
of
the
body
works
and
creates
terrific
pressure
to
send
blood
to
that
emergency
area
and
so
you
can
imagine
that
blood
was
spurting
out
of
this
wound
every
time
his
heart
beat.
it
did
that
until
there
was
no
more
blood
to
send.
so,
they
asked
for
a
search
warrant.
they
went
to
the
judge
and
they
said,
we
have
the
body
we
have
the
material
from
the
thunderbird
automobile.among
those
materials
which
were
blood-soak
is
a
man
from
a
dodge
automobile
which
is
saturated
with
blood.
we
have
the
dodge
automobile
on
the
farm
and
then
on
the
backseat
it’s
saturated
with
blood.
we
would
like
to
take
that
vehicle
and
search
it
for
further
evidence
of
this
apparent
murder
and
the
judge
says
yes,
you
do
it.
and
you
impound
the
vehicle
and
then
it
later
became
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
issued
a
search
warrant
for
the
vehicle.
he
also
directed
them
to
impound
the
vehicle
which
is
in
the
record.
the
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
first
one
but
not
the
dodge.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
thunderbird
yes,
but
the
dodge
vehicle
was
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
we’re
talking
about
the
dodge
that,
it
was
on
the
farm.
and
so
the
search
warrant
issued
at
8:15
that
evening.
this
is
september
in
wisconsin.
and
as
the
record
indicates,
it
was
getting
dusk
when
the
crime
laboratory
people
arrived
from
madison
at
7:20.
so,
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
that
at
8:15
it
was
getting
pretty
dark.
the
search
warrant
was
issued,
the
under
sheriff
from
the
others
went
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
got
a
tow
truck
to
haul
to
vehicle
into
fond
du
lac
in
sheriff’s
garage.
now,
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think
made
a
serious
error
in
finding
that
the
under
sheriff
had
executed
the
search
warrant
at
the
farm
when
he
went
out
and
looked
into
the
dodge.
there
was
testimony
that
he
opened
the
door
and
looked
in.
i
think
they
questioned
him
on
a
motion
after
verdict
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
searched
the
vehicle
and
he
said
yes.
no
materials
were
taken
out
of
that
vehicle
at
the
farm
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
trial
record
and
find
out
who
identified
all
of
these
items
and
a
murder
case
where
you
got
a
lot
people
handling
the
various
items
of
evidence,
you
have
to
have
a
chain
of
evidence
proof,
the
chain
of
evidence
firmly
establishes
that
this
mr.
mauer
from
the
crime
laboratory
was
the
first
man
to
take
anything
under
that
dodge
and
that
was
done
while
the
dodge
was
impounded
in
the
sheriff’s
garage
in
fond
du
lac.
now,
there’s
a
direct
quote
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
undersheriff
seized
the
tarp
and
the
sock
in
the
dodge
that
evening.
it
is
not
true.
it
cannot
be
supported
by
any
interpretation
of
this
record.
in
fact,
the
record
is
so
clear
that
everything
was
taken
out
of
that
dodge
at
the
time
of
the
search
on
the
morning
of
the
13th.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
mr.
mauer
from
the
crime
laboratory.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
mr.
mauer
is
an
expert
who
--
we
have
a
crime
laboratory
system
in
our
department
of
justice.
they
go
out
and
help
local
unfortunate
people
on
specialized
things.
the
sheriff
called.
sheriffs
in
small
counties
are
not
experts.
as
we
all
know
from
all
these
search
and
seizure
cases.
we’re
putting
too
much
burden
on
them.
but
mr.
mauer
was
called.
he
was
told
that
there’s
a
search
warrant
and
so
since
the
vehicle
was
impounded,
they
waited
until
the
next
morning
and
conducted
the
thorough
search
because
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
search
in
that
vehicle.
it
was
to
obtain
all
of
the
physical
evidence
of
the
crime
that
were
--
that
was
available.
and
only
an
expert
who
knew
what
take
out
of
the
vehicle
could
decide
that
at
that
time.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor.
when
i
was
preparing
the
appendix,
i
contacted
the
clerk’s
office
in
milwaukee
and
for
some
reason
or
other,
there
was
no
entry
made
in
the
docket
to
show
that
after
a
stipulation
had
been
entered
that
the
record
was
not
brought
to
chicago,
it
did
and
that
letter
was
later
on
sent
to
the
court
and
the
clerk
has
it
now.
so,
i
apologize
for
any
misleading.
it
was
unintentional.
i
thought
i
checked
everything
and
i
went
there
personally
to
see
what
the
record
consisted
of
and
it
was
later
on
when
the
--
mr.
mulligan
was
preparing
his
brief
that
these
records
were
found.
part
of
them
is
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
clerk’s
office
and
part
of
them
in
milwaukee.
but
they
are
here
no,
all
the
record
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
seventh
circuit
asked
for
the
record
to
be
sent
down
there
several
months
after
the
other
--
the
rest
of
the
record
went.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
subsequently,
the
clerk
in
milwaukee
found
a
transmittal
letter.
it
wasn’t
in
this
file,
apparently
in
this
file.
and
the
letter
was
sent
to
this
court
after
the
record
came
down.
it
was
added
to
the
record
here.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
the
court
of
appeals,
i’m
satisfied,
have
the
full
record.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
it
did.
the
return
on
the
warrant
was
made
on
the
14th.
that’s
another
fact
that
the
seventh
circuit
determined
that
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
they
said
that
the
warrant
was
executed
and
a
return
prepared
and
therefore
the
warrant
was
functus
officio.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
what
kind
of
games
are
we
playing?
we
can’t
even
take
a
vehicle
that’s
been
impounded
and
search
it
for
evidence
of
murder
without
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
on
both
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
if
i
may
just
at
the
moment,
the
search
by
officer
weiss,
if
we
want
to
call
the
search,
every
court
has
picked
up
a
new
name
and
we
try
to
stay
away
from
the
word
search
because
we
--
we
really
don’t
know
what
a
search
is.
it
was
done
by
officer
weiss
with
the
intention
of
securing
some
property
of
mr.
dombrowski.
five
different
times,
there
were
fact-finding
hearings
where
this
fact
could’ve
been
refuted
by
mr.
dombrowski
including
a
hearing
before
the
district
court
of
milwaukee
which
he
did
not
avail
himself
of,
so
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
mr.
weiss’
statement
that
he
was
looking
for
the
gun.
he
had
no
knowledge
of
any
other
kind.
he
was
completely
surprised
by
the
evidence
of
murder
which
emerged
when
he
opened
the
trunk.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that’s
right,
your
honor.
the
--
i
think
on
that
point,
that
nowadays
police
officers
are
not
just
law
enforcers.
we
have
millions
of
vehicles
on
the
highway
everyday
and
everywhere
where
you
and
i
drive
our
vehicles,
we
might
force
a
local
law
enforcement
official
to
either
arrest
us
for
violating
the
law,
to
come
to
our
aid
if
we
have
an
accident,
to
come
to
our
aid
if
we
have
a
heart
attack.
in
any
of
a
number
of
circumstances,
a
law
enforcement
officer
may
be
called
upon
to
help
someone
who
is
in
a
vehicle
away
from
his
home.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
should
look
at
what
we
are
calling
now,
i
guess,
inventory
searches,
and
see
whether
or
not
you
can’t
find
some
area
where
a
person
that
gets
out
in
the
highway
with
his
vehicle
doesn’t
leave
behind
a
little
bit
of
that
privacy
that
we
are
so
concerned
about.
it’s
very
difficult
to
play
the
dual
role
of
a
law-enforcement
officer
and
the
helper.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that’s
right.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
and
that
record
is
so
clear
on
that,
that
we
think
that
this
act
of
the
guy
of
sending
that
rookie
police
officer
to
look
after
this
fellow
officer’s
gun
should
not
result
in
the
freeing
of
a
man
who
has
been
convicted
fairly
of
first
degree
murder.
thank
you.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
thank
you
your
honor.
the
reasonableness
of
suspecting
that
someone
may
try
to
get
into
the
trunk
of
the
disabled
automobile
has
been
brought
up
and
the
allegation
by
other
counsel
is
that
in
a
small
town,
you
don’t
have
those
worries.
i
know
a
lot
of
small
town
district
attorneys
that
would
like
to
have
some
proof
of
that
when
they
are
prosecuting
people
for
breaking
open
trunks
and
taking
spare
tires
and
wheels.
and
especially
when
they
see
a
car
disabled
to
modern
state.
how
naïve
are
we?
this
is
1973.
people
move
from
here
to
there
to
everywhere
and
small
towns
are
no
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
pretty
close
to
it,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it’s
on
highway
45
between
milwaukee
and
fond
du
lac.
i
just
like
to
pause
by
saying
that
we’re
not
here
to
determine
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
dombrowski.
he
has
been
found
guilty
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
by
the
proper
courts
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
we
are
here
on
a
collateral
attack
upon
that
judgment
and
what
you
have
to
determine
is
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
punish
two
law
enforcement
people
who
thought
they
were
doing
their
duty
five
years
ago,
five-and-a-half
years
ago.
and
what
your
theory
will
have
to
be
is
that
if
you
free
this
man,
you
will
thereby
have
slapped
those
two
officers
in
the
face.
and
you
would
have
told
them,
don’t
do
it
again
and
you
will
told
other
officers
don’t
do
this.
it
won’t
work.
one
of
the
officers
is
no
longer
in
wisconsin.
i
don’t
know
if
he’s
even
in
law
enforcement.
you
cannot
by
this
method,
satisfy
society’s
needs
to
deal
with
criminals.
and
i
would
urge
that
you
recognize
that
this
man
is
a
convicted
murderer
and
reverse
the
seventh
circuit.
thank
you.
