mr.
dalton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
dombrowski
authorized
them
to
take
the
car
to
this
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
inference
reasonable
that
the
man,
the
body
was
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
carried
up
to
the
farm
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
whom?
who
did
that
searching?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
not
the
deputy.
it
is
the
other
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
time,
the
only
crime,
if
any,
was
the
crime
of
drunken
driving
and
the
consequences
of
the
accident,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
dalton.
mr.
mulligan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
that
time,
your
friend
indicated
that
dombrowski
was
suffering
from
over-indulgence
in
alcohol
and
perhaps
from
some
shock
from
the
accident,
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
sure
just
what
the
point
here
or
whether
you
had
a
point
in
mind
in
comparing
the
casual
weight
of
the
first
car,
the
ford
involved
in
the
accident
was
taken
to
the
filling
station
as
compared
with
the
more
careful
steps
with
respect
to
the
dodge
but
would
you
agree
that
it
might
be
reasonable
to
take
very
casual
steps
with
respect
to
just
a
damaged
car
with
no
criminal
acts
involved
except
drunken
driving
and
much
more
precise
and
careful
steps
when
there
appeared
to
be
a
homicide
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
automobile
involved
in
the
accident
would
be
an
important
item
of
evidence
even
in
a
drunk
driving
charge,
would
it
not?
to
show
the
extent
of
the
damage,
as
it
would
bear
upon
the
quality
of
the
driving,
just
as
an
evidentiary
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
dombrowski
ran
into
some
immovable
object,
didn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn’t
hit
another
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
suggest
that
the
condition
of
the
car
would
not
be
an
evidentiary
irrelevant
piece
of
evidence
in
establishing
the
drunken
driving
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
made
that
call,
the
doctor
or
the
police?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
you
suggesting
that
the
doctor
wanted
to
find
out
whether
he
suffered
perhaps
from
epilepsy
or
heart
condition
or
something
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
wouldn’t
be
very
difficult
to
observe
when
they
took
him
into
the
station
and
down
to
the
hospital
in
that
period
of
time,
they
certainly
would’ve
--
quite
casual
observation
of
them
whether
he
had
a
typical
service
revolver
on
him,
wouldn’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
would
it
be
unreasonable
for
police
to
assume
in
this
day
and
age
than
an
unattended
car
sitting
in
a
filling
station
light
overnight
might
be
broken
into
both
trunk
and
the
body
of
the
car
by
either
vandals
or
youngsters
or
somebody
been
on
theft.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
talking
about
right
--
i’m
talking
about
the
practical
aspect.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
conditions
are
so
safe
in
that
part
of
wisconsin
that
no
one
ever
has
his
car
broken
into
at
night
if
it’s
left
out
unattended?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
not
as
often
as
chicago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
trunk
hadn’t
been
searched?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
not
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
were
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
appointed
only
at
this
stage
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
seventh
circuit
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
speaking
of
the
thunderbird
before.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
you’d
have
to
have
an
explicit
statutory
authority,
mr.
mulligan
to
take
into
police
custody,
the
car
involved
in
a
drunken
driving
situation
where
there
was
damage
to
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
it
could
be
impounded
as
evidence
in
the
drunk
driving
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
inherently,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
understand
your
argument
that
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
it
but
you
do
concede
that
they
would
the
power
to
take
it
for
that
for
that
purpose,
if
they
wanted
to
use
it
as
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
mulligan.
mr.
dalton,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
dalton.
mr.

you
served
at
the

on
