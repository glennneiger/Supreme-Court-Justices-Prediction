unknown
speaker
had
it
been
a
locked?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
this
officer
weiss,
where
did
he
get
the
key
to
open
it?
unknown
speaker
it
had
been
taken
from
dombrowski
when
he
was
left
in
the
hospital?
unknown
speaker
but
why
was
it
taken
there
at
all,
just
because
it
was
some
place
to
--
unknown
speaker
for
safekeeping
or
what?
unknown
speaker
so,
this
was
the
usual
arrangement
for
the
custody
of
the
car?
unknown
speaker
with
the
station?
i
mean,
what
--
unknown
speaker
did
he
just
say
yes
or
did
he
issue
a
search
warrant?
unknown
speaker
the
first
one.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dalton,
i’m
confused
about
one
thing.
is
it
clear
that
the
seventh
circuit
had
the
entire
state
record
before
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
another
question
mr.
dalton,
i
take
it
that
all
of
the
items
taken
from
the
dodge
were
taken
within
the
48
hours,
it
issues
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me
--
unknown
speaker
but
did
it
--
i
understood
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
turned
not
on
any
search.
i
know
it
did
a
lot
of
talking
about
the
search
of
the
dodge.
but
i
thought
what
really
happened
here
was
that
they
reversed
on
the
search
of
the
ford.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it’s
on
both?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
the
officer
didn’t
want
to
as
excuse
or
his
only
advice
was
that
he
wanted
to.
if
there
was
a
gun
in
the
car,
he
didn’t
want
it
floating
around
in
that
car
--
unknown
speaker
--
he
wants
to
get
it
out.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mulligan,
when
you
said
he
gave
them
three
different
versions,
were
they
inconsistent
versions
of
the
accident?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
accept
the
version
that
what
they
were
doing,
they
were
doing
as
a
favor
for
a
fellow
officer
anyway?
that’s
the
reason
they
were
searching
for
the
gun?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show,
what
was
the
matter
with
him
at
that
time?
that’s
quite
a
period
of
time
and
was
he
still
--
but
was
he
still
drinking
or
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
then
if
they
were
improperly
admitted,
there
should
be
an
affirmance
here
without
reaching
the
question
that
was
taken
from
the
dodge.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
i’ve
said
is
if
the
--
if
the
materials
taken
from
the
ford
should
not
have
been
admitted,
there
has
to
be
a
reversal
of
this
conviction,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
reach
the
other
question.
unknown
speaker
whether
that’s
the
way
judge
dock
(ph)
read
it
because
that’s
the
only
search
to
which
he
addressed
this
dissent,
wasn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
advisory
apparently
not
an
actual
decision
on
that
search,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mulligan,
did
the
defendant
take
the
stand
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
had
it
been
a
locked?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
this
officer
weiss,
where
did
he
get
the
key
to
open
it?
unknown
speaker
it
