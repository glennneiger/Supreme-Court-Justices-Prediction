mr.
thomas
h.
denney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
the
superintendent
of
the
oregon
state
penitentiary
and
he
has
the
respondent
daniel
p.
murphy
in
his
custody.
an
oregon
state
trial
court
convicted
murphy
of
second
degree
murder,
the
second
degree
murder
of
his
wife.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
the
oregon
supreme
court
denied
a
petition
for
discretionary
review
of
that
decision.
this
court
denied
murphy’s
petition
for
certiorari,
murphy
then
commenced
this
presently
federal
habeas
corpus
action,
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
district
of
oregon
relying
very
much
on
the
opinion
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
and
agreeing
with
it
in
full
denied
habeas
corpus
relief
and
on
murphy’s
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
ordering
petitioner
cupp
to
release
murphy
within
60
days
unless
the
state
of
oregon
retries
him
within
that
time.
there’s
been
only
one
question
raised
in
preserve
throughout
these
proceedings
and
that
is
the
legality
of
the
seizure
of
certain
evidence
which
was
used
in
murphy’s
trial.
in
the
state
court
trial
as
part
of
the
showing
that
murphy
strangled
his
wife
while
she
was
asleep
in
bed
and
while
wearing
a
rayon
acetate
night
gown.
the
state
introduced
some
scrapings
that
were
taken
from
underneath
murphy’s
fingernails
while
he
was
at
the
police
station
and
those
scrapings
revealed
the
presence
of
blood,
skin
cells,
cotton
fibers
and
rayon
and
acetate
fibers.
the
case
--
well
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
and
the
us
district
court
and
our
position
here
can
be
reduced
into
three
simple
propositions
basically.
the
first
being
that
as
the
courts
of
oregon
held,
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
either
arrest
or
to
search
murphy
at
the
time
they
conducted
the
search
that
there
were
exigent
circumstances
justifying
an
immediate
taking
of
the
evidence
from
murphy
even
though
the
police
did
not
formally
place
murphy
under
arrest
nor
did
they
seek
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
to
seize
this
evidence
from
underneath
murphy’s
fingernails
and
finally
that
the
momentary
detention
while
this
evidence
was
taken
was
more
reasonable
or
at
least
no
less
reasonable
than
the
full
scale
formal
arrest
would
have
been
or
then
detaining
murphy
indefinitely.
restraining
him
physically
to
the
degree
that
would
have
been
necessary
to
prevent
possible
loss
or
destruction
of
this
evidence,
for
the
longer
time
that
would
have
been
necessary
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
after
murphy
arrived
at
the
police
station,
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cost
to
conduct
the
search
every
court
below
has
held
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
police
to
act
but
of
course
the
question
is
briefed
and
argued
here.
i
think
that
in
their
brief,
counsel
for
murphy
and
counsel
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union
who
are
appearing
here
amicus
curiae
on
murphy’s
behalf
understate
the
evidence.
the
facts
of
the
case
in
this
particular
situation
were
that
the
police
had
the
--
were
investigating
a
strangulation
murder.
the
deceased
was
found
in
her
bed
in
a
perfectly
made
up
room.
there
was
no
signs
of
disturbance,
no
signs
of
forced
entry
of
the
house,
no
signs
of
robbery.
all
of
this
we
think
tends
to
show
that
the
killer
was
probably
known
to
the
deceased.
the
murphy’s
have
been
separated
for
some
time
and
murphy
was
not
living
in
the
murphy
house
at
the
time
of
the
homicide
but
he
had
been
and
the
police
learned
expected
home
that
night.
the
deceased
was
manually
strangled
to
the
observation
of
the
homicide
detectives.
there
was
not
a
formal
medical
report
on
this
point
for
some
time
but
the
officers
made
their
own
opinion
which
i
think
is
enough
to
go
to
constitute
probable
cause
even
though
we
of
course
don’t
have
at
this
point
legal
admissible
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
death.
there
were
scratches
on
the
neck
of
the
deceased
which
appeared
to
the
officers
to
be
scratches
made
from
fingernails
of
the
strangler.
this
was
later
confirmed
at
least
to
be
a
fingernail
scraping
by
the
pathologist
who
examined
the
body.
and
the
son,
the
18-year-old
son
of
the
murphy’s
who
was
the
only
other
person
in
the
house
or
known
to
be
in
the
house
on
the
night
of
the
murder
was
apparently
a
chronic
nail
biter.
now
the
record
is
not
perhaps
is
clear
on
this
point
as
it
might
be
desired
but
the
police
do
say
that
he
bit
his
fingernails
well
back
into
the
quick,
he
had
no
fingernails
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
scrape
them.
i
believe
that’s
all
the
record
specifically
says,
i
conjecture
from
this
perhaps
unjustifiably,
i
don’t
know
that
he
is
a
chronic
nail
biter
who
has
bit
his
nails
for
a
long
time.
there’s
a
suggestion
in
trying
to
negate
the
existence
of
probable
cause
in
respondents
brief
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
when
this
nail
biting
occurred.
my
inference
from
my
reading
of
the
record
simply
as
it
this
was
a
chronically
reoccurring
condition.
in
any
rate,
they
also
learned,
the
police
also
learned
from
the
son
patrick
murphy
that
murphy
was
expected
home
that
evening.
the
police
called
camp
sherman
oregon
which
is
in
eastern
oregon
incidentally
rather
than
in
southern
oregon
as
the
record
several
times
says.
it’s
in
central
oregon
about
a
100
miles
east
of
salem
and
left
word
of
mrs.
murphy’s
death.
murphy
was
not
at
camp
sherman
at
the
time,
they
learned
from
the
person
that
they
talked
to
over
the
telephone
that
he
had
substantially
been
going
into
portland
that
preceding
night
and
he
was
expected
back.
the
police
left
word
for
murphy
to
call
and
he
did
about
4
pm,
without
--
apparently
according
to
the
record,
without
inquiring
into
the
circumstances
of
his
wife’s
death
other
than
to
confirm
the
fact
that
his
wife
was
indeed
dead.
murphy
immediately
went
into
a
long
account
of
where
he
had
been
the
night
before
without
any
questioning
on
the
officers
part.
he
then
agreed
to
come
to
portland
to
discuss
the
case
further
with
the
police.
when
he
arrived
to
the
station,
he
was
fully
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
he
had
two
lawyers
called
who
came
to
the
station
to
represent
him.
murphy
again
seemed
curiously
disinterested
in
the
circumstances
of
his
wife’s
death
and
instructed
his
behavior
struck
the
detectives
as
unusual
in
that
respect.
while
they
were
talking
to
him
one
of
the
detectives
saw
a
dark
spot
underneath
murphy’s
right
thumbnail
which
prompted
him
to
think
about
taking
fingernail
scrapings.
they
asked
murphy
for
permission
to
scrape
his
fingernails
and
on
the
advice
of
counsel
he
refused
where
upon
the
police
scraped
the
fingernails
anyway.
there
is
also
testimony
in
the
record
that
when
the
request
for
fingernail
scrapings
was
made,
murphy
suddenly
and
immediately
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
started
moving
his
hands
and
that
he
then
inserted
them
to
his
pockets
moving
them
around
very
vigorously
so
that
change
or
something
metallic
in
the
pocket
was
heard
rattling.
we
think
that
all
of
this,
all
of
these
circumstances
clearly
gave
the
police
probable
cause
to
act
to
secure
the
fingernail
scrapings.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
thought
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
would
have
no
difficulty
if
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
perhaps
it
is,
the
definition
that
the
oregon
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
right,
i
suppose
the
only
answer
i
can
give
there
mr.
justice
stuart
because
it
does
occur
to
me
that
this
could
be
perfectly
well
denominated
an
arrest
and
that
would
be
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
reason
i
think
is
because
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
held
rightly
or
wrongly
and
we
have
followed
this
all
the
way
along
and
i
believe
that
they
sited
one
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
so
said,
that
the
arrest
is
the
taking
of
the
person
into
custody
to
make
him
answer
for
the
charge.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
see.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well
i’m
simply
adhering
to
what
the
oregon
court
said
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
at
page
79
of
the
printed
appendix,
they
site
terry
versus
ohio
for
the
definition
that
they
used
and
went
from
there
to
say
well
even
if
it
isn’t
an
arrest
or
assuming
that
it
isn’t
an
arrest.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well
i
appreciate
that
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
did
not
have
the
confidence
in
the
position
that
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
did
not
adopt
that
i
have
here,
it’s
that
simple.
of
course
if
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
if
this
court
of
course
holds
that
is
an
arrest
within
the
meaning
of
the
search
and
seizure
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
problem,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case
of
course
and
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
your
honor
and
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
that
is
true,
that
is
essentially
the
position
that
the
court
of
oregon
court
of
appeals
took
and
perhaps
they
misunderstood
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
whether
this
was
an
arrest
or
not.
as
for
the
exigent
circumstances
which
justified
the
immediate
seizure
from
murphy’s
person
whether
or
not
he
was
under
arrest.
we
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
this
evidence
at
least
was
potentially
readily
destructible
and
perhaps
if
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
district
attorney
who
was
present
at
the
time
the
request
was
made
and
one
of
the
detectives
if
that
testimony
is
to
be
believed.
it
was
in
fact
in
the
actual
process
of
destruction
at
the
time
the
police
took
the
fingernails
scraping.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
no,
in
the
absence
of
the
exigent
circumstances
which
are
present
here,
i’m
not
arguing
for
a
blanket
rule
that
probable
cause
just
by
a
seizure
warrant
less
seizure
from
the
person.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
very
much
so
and
if
anything
the
situation
here
is
even
more
critical
because
the
alcohol
in
schmerber’s
blood
stream
was
so
--
would
only
dissipate
itself
over
a
relatively
lengthy
period
of
time
where
as
murphy
could
have
destroyed
the
fingernail
scrapings
if
given
the
opportunity
in
a
matter
of
seconds.
again
assuming
that
this
was
not
an
arrest
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
the
search
in
this
case
has
to
be
justified
without
the
arrest
factor
involved
in
it,
it
is
our
position
as
developed
in
the
brief
that
this
is
in
fact
a
less
serious
invasion
of
murphy’s
privacy
then
would
have
been
the
case.
either
had
the
police
made
a
full
scale
arrest
and
kept
him
indefinitely
while
the
fingernail
scrapings
were
analyzed
instead
of
releasing
him
after
the
scrapings
were
taken
or
holding
him
at
the
station
and
forcibly
restraining
him
from
making
any
attempt
to
destroy
the
evidence
which
was
literally
at
his
fingertips.
as
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
observed,
we
just
don’t
think
proper
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
requires
any
such
extreme
measure.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
just
briefly,
two
points
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
police
did
not
in
fact
arrest
murphy
at
that
time
or
did
not
formally
place
him
under
arrest
and
hold
him
indefinitely.
no
more
negates
to
the
existence
of
probable
cause
than
the
fact
that
a
person
is
arrested
establishes
that
there
is.
this
is
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
review
in
the
light
of
what
the
facts
and
circumstances
known
the
police
officer
are
and
our
position
is
that
there
was
ample
cause
here
and
i
think
we
have
been
supported
in
that
determination
by
every
court
below.
the
second
thing
is
i
do
not
see
this
case
as
controlled
by
davis
and
with
respect
are
advocated
by
counsel
here
because
as
i
have
developed
in
our
petitioners
brief.
the
davis,
there
was
no
probable
cause,
this
was
a
summary
roundup
off
every
negro
in
the
community
when
all
the
assailant
the
rape
case
new
was
that
her
assailant
was
a
negro
and
the
fingerprinting
of
them
all.
our
contention
here
is
that
the
finger
of
probable
cause
are
pretty
well
focused
on
murphy
at
the
time
the
police
acted.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
the
superintendent
of
the
oregon
state
penitentiary
and
he
has
the
respondent
daniel
p.
murphy
in
his
custody.
an
oregon
state
trial
court
convicted
murphy
of
second
degree
murder,
the
second
degree
murder
of
his
wife.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
the
oregon
supreme
court
denied
a
petition
for
discretionary
review
of
that
decision.
this
court
denied
murphy’s
petition
for
certiorari,
murphy
then
commenced
this
presently
federal
habeas
corpus
action,
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
district
of
oregon
relying
very
much
on
the
opinion
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
and
agreeing
with
it
in
full
denied
habeas
corpus
relief
and
on
murphy’s
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
ordering
petitioner
cupp
to
release
murphy
within
60
days
unless
the
state
of
oregon
retries
him
within
that
time.
there’s
been
only
one
question
raised
in
preserve
throughout
these
proceedings
and
that
is
the
legality
of
the
seizure
of
certain
evidence
which
was
used
in
murphy’s
trial.
in
the
state
court
trial
as
part
of
the
showing
that
murphy
strangled
his
wife
while
she
was
asleep
in
bed
and
while
wearing
a
rayon
acetate
night
gown.
the
state
introduced
some
scrapings
that
were
taken
from
underneath
murphy’s
fingernails
while
he
was
at
the
police
station
and
those
scrapings
revealed
the
presence
of
blood,
skin
cells,
cotton
fibers
and
rayon
and
acetate
fibers.
the
case
--
well
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
and
the
us
district
court
and
our
position
here
can
be
reduced
into
three
simple
propositions
basically.
the
first
being
that
as
the
courts
of
oregon
held,
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
either
arrest
or
to
search
murphy
at
the
time
they
conducted
the
search
that
there
were
exigent
circumstances
justifying
an
immediate
taking
of
the
evidence
from
murphy
even
though
the
police
did
not
formally
place
murphy
under
arrest
nor
did
they
seek
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
to
seize
this
evidence
from
underneath
murphy’s
fingernails
and
finally
that
the
momentary
detention
while
this
evidence
was
taken
was
more
reasonable
or
at
least
no
less
reasonable
than
the
full
scale
formal
arrest
would
have
been
or
then
detaining
murphy
indefinitely.
restraining
him
physically
to
the
degree
that
would
have
been
necessary
to
prevent
possible
loss
or
destruction
of
this
evidence,
for
the
longer
time
that
would
have
been
necessary
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
after
murphy
arrived
at
the
police
station,
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cost
to
conduct
the
search
every
court
below
has
held
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
police
to
act
but
of
course
the
question
is
briefed
and
argued
here.
i
think
that
in
their
brief,
counsel
for
murphy
and
counsel
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union
who
are
appearing
here
amicus
curiae
on
murphy’s
behalf
understate
the
evidence.
the
facts
of
the
case
in
this
particular
situation
were
that
the
police
had
the
--
were
investigating
a
strangulation
murder.
the
deceased
was
found
in
her
bed
in
a
perfectly
made
up
room.
there
was
no
signs
of
disturbance,
no
signs
of
forced
entry
of
the
house,
no
signs
of
robbery.
all
of
this
we
think
tends
to
show
that
the
killer
was
probably
known
to
the
deceased.
the
murphy’s
have
been
separated
for
some
time
and
murphy
was
not
living
in
the
murphy
house
at
the
time
of
the
homicide
but
he
had
been
and
the
police
learned
expected
home
that
night.
the
deceased
was
manually
strangled
to
the
observation
of
the
homicide
detectives.
there
was
not
a
formal
medical
report
on
this
point
for
some
time
but
the
officers
made
their
own
opinion
which
i
think
is
enough
to
go
to
constitute
probable
cause
even
though
we
of
course
don’t
have
at
this
point
legal
admissible
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
death.
there
were
scratches
on
the
neck
of
the
deceased
which
appeared
to
the
officers
to
be
scratches
made
from
fingernails
of
the
strangler.
this
was
later
confirmed
at
least
to
be
a
fingernail
scraping
by
the
pathologist
who
examined
the
body.
and
the
son,
the
18-year-old
son
of
the
murphy’s
who
was
the
only
other
person
in
the
house
or
known
to
be
in
the
house
on
the
night
of
the
murder
was
apparently
a
chronic
nail
biter.
now
the
record
is
not
perhaps
is
clear
on
this
point
as
it
might
be
desired
but
the
police
do
say
that
he
bit
his
fingernails
well
back
into
the
quick,
he
had
no
fingernails
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
scrape
them.
i
believe
that’s
all
the
record
specifically
says,
i
conjecture
from
this
perhaps
unjustifiably,
i
don’t
know
that
he
is
a
chronic
nail
biter
who
has
bit
his
nails
for
a
long
time.
there’s
a
suggestion
in
trying
to
negate
the
existence
of
probable
cause
in
respondents
brief
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
when
this
nail
biting
occurred.
my
inference
from
my
reading
of
the
record
simply
as
it
this
was
a
chronically
reoccurring
condition.
in
any
rate,
they
also
learned,
the
police
also
learned
from
the
son
patrick
murphy
that
murphy
was
expected
home
that
evening.
the
police
called
camp
sherman
oregon
which
is
in
eastern
oregon
incidentally
rather
than
in
southern
oregon
as
the
record
several
times
says.
it’s
in
central
oregon
about
a
100
miles
east
of
salem
and
left
word
of
mrs.
murphy’s
death.
murphy
was
not
at
camp
sherman
at
the
time,
they
learned
from
the
person
that
they
talked
to
over
the
telephone
that
he
had
substantially
been
going
into
portland
that
preceding
night
and
he
was
expected
back.
the
police
left
word
for
murphy
to
call
and
he
did
about
4
pm,
without
--
apparently
according
to
the
record,
without
inquiring
into
the
circumstances
of
his
wife’s
death
other
than
to
confirm
the
fact
that
his
wife
was
indeed
dead.
murphy
immediately
went
into
a
long
account
of
where
he
had
been
the
night
before
without
any
questioning
on
the
officers
part.
he
then
agreed
to
come
to
portland
to
discuss
the
case
further
with
the
police.
when
he
arrived
to
the
station,
he
was
fully
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
he
had
two
lawyers
called
who
came
to
the
station
to
represent
him.
murphy
again
seemed
curiously
disinterested
in
the
circumstances
of
his
wife’s
death
and
instructed
his
behavior
struck
the
detectives
as
unusual
in
that
respect.
while
they
were
talking
to
him
one
of
the
detectives
saw
a
dark
spot
underneath
murphy’s
right
thumbnail
which
prompted
him
to
think
about
taking
fingernail
scrapings.
they
asked
murphy
for
permission
to
scrape
his
fingernails
and
on
the
advice
of
counsel
he
refused
where
upon
the
police
scraped
the
fingernails
anyway.
there
is
also
testimony
in
the
record
that
when
the
request
for
fingernail
scrapings
was
made,
murphy
suddenly
and
immediately
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
started
moving
his
hands
and
that
he
then
inserted
them
to
his
pockets
moving
them
around
very
vigorously
so
that
change
or
something
metallic
in
the
pocket
was
heard
rattling.
we
think
that
all
of
this,
all
of
these
circumstances
clearly
gave
the
police
probable
cause
to
act
to
secure
the
fingernail
scrapings.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
thought
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
would
have
no
difficulty
if
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
perhaps
it
is,
the
definition
that
the
oregon
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
right,
i
suppose
the
only
answer
i
can
give
there
mr.
justice
stuart
because
it
does
occur
to
me
that
this
could
be
perfectly
well
denominated
an
arrest
and
that
would
be
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
reason
i
think
is
because
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
held
rightly
or
wrongly
and
we
have
followed
this
all
the
way
along
and
i
believe
that
they
sited
one
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
so
said,
that
the
arrest
is
the
taking
of
the
person
into
custody
to
make
him
answer
for
the
charge.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
see.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well
i’m
simply
adhering
to
what
the
oregon
court
said
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
at
page
79
of
the
printed
appendix,
they
site
terry
versus
ohio
for
the
definition
that
they
used
and
went
from
there
to
say
well
even
if
it
isn’t
an
arrest
or
assuming
that
it
isn’t
an
arrest.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well
i
appreciate
that
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
did
not
have
the
confidence
in
the
position
that
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
did
not
adopt
that
i
have
here,
it’s
that
simple.
of
course
if
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
if
this
court
of
course
holds
that
is
an
arrest
within
the
meaning
of
the
search
and
seizure
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
problem,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case
of
course
and
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes
your
honor
and
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
that
is
true,
that
is
essentially
the
position
that
the
court
of
oregon
court
of
appeals
took
and
perhaps
they
misunderstood
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
whether
this
was
an
arrest
or
not.
as
for
the
exigent
circumstances
which
justified
the
immediate
seizure
from
murphy’s
person
whether
or
not
he
was
under
arrest.
we
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
this
evidence
at
least
was
potentially
readily
destructible
and
perhaps
if
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
district
attorney
who
was
present
at
the
time
the
request
was
made
and
one
of
the
detectives
if
that
testimony
is
to
be
believed.
it
was
in
fact
in
the
actual
process
of
destruction
at
the
time
the
police
took
the
fingernails
scraping.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
no,
in
the
absence
of
the
exigent
circumstances
which
are
present
here,
i’m
not
arguing
for
a
blanket
rule
that
probable
cause
just
by
a
seizure
warrant
less
seizure
from
the
person.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
very
much
so
and
if
anything
the
situation
here
is
even
more
critical
because
the
alcohol
in
schmerber’s
blood
stream
was
so
--
would
only
dissipate
itself
over
a
relatively
lengthy
period
of
time
where
as
murphy
could
have
destroyed
the
fingernail
scrapings
if
given
the
opportunity
in
a
matter
of
seconds.
again
assuming
that
this
was
not
an
arrest
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
the
search
in
this
case
has
to
be
justified
without
the
arrest
factor
involved
in
it,
it
is
our
position
as
developed
in
the
brief
that
this
is
in
fact
a
less
serious
invasion
of
murphy’s
privacy
then
would
have
been
the
case.
either
had
the
police
made
a
full
scale
arrest
and
kept
him
indefinitely
while
the
fingernail
scrapings
were
analyzed
instead
of
releasing
him
after
the
scrapings
were
taken
or
holding
him
at
the
station
and
forcibly
restraining
him
from
making
any
attempt
to
destroy
the
evidence
which
was
literally
at
his
fingertips.
as
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
observed,
we
just
don’t
think
proper
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
requires
any
such
extreme
measure.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
just
briefly,
two
points
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
police
did
not
in
fact
arrest
murphy
at
that
time
or
did
not
formally
place
him
under
arrest
and
hold
him
indefinitely.
no
more
negates
to
the
existence
of
probable
cause
than
the
fact
that
a
person
is
arrested
establishes
that
there
is.
this
is
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
review
in
the
light
of
what
the
facts
and
circumstances
known
the
police
officer
are
and
our
position
is
that
there
was
ample
cause
here
and
i
think
we
have
been
supported
in
that
determination
by
every
court
below.
the
second
thing
is
i
do
not
see
this
case
as
controlled
by
davis
and
with
respect
are
advocated
by
counsel
here
because
as
i
have
developed
in
our
petitioners
brief.
the
davis,
there
was
no
probable
cause,
this
was
a
summary
roundup
off
every
negro
in
the
community
when
all
the
assailant
the
rape
case
new
was
that
her
assailant
was
a
negro
and
the
fingerprinting
of
them
all.
our
contention
here
is
that
the
finger
of
probable
cause
are
pretty
well
focused
on
murphy
at
the
time
the
police
acted.
