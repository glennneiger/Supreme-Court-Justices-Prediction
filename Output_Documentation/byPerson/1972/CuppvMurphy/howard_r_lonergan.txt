mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
i
think
the
first
consideration
is
rather
like
this
case
held
in
coolidge
that’s
implicit
in
coolidge.
essentially
every
extension
into
the
protection
of
the
bill
of
rights
is
really
not
an
end
in
itself
but
it’s
merely
to
the
springboard
for
the
next
extension.
for
example
--
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
i
do
not
know
of
any.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
you
take
note
for
example
mr.
justice
stewart
has
mentioned
“was
this
not
an
arrest?”
well
of
course
that
would
be
contrary
to
this
case,
this
court’s
decision
in
terry
because
it
held
there
that
the
detention
was
not
an
arrest
because
it
was
not
the
first
step
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
now
of
course
the
word
arrest
that
we
give
it
its
english
and
french
meaning
literally,
it
is
any
stopping
and
yet
terry
saw
the
contrary.
so
i
don’t
think
we
can
say
it
was
an
arrest.
furthermore
we
have
the
situation
of
when
you
say
it
was
on
probable
cause,
it
is
about
the
thinnest
case
of
probable
cause
that
i
can
see
from
the
actual
facts
because
i
think
mr.
denney
been
up
the
facts
to
a
circumstance.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
i
don’t
think
it
did
rest
on
that
assumption,
it
says
even
if
they
were.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
i
would
think
that
you
have
to
determine
whether
this
probable
cause,
if
you
reached
that
point?
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
i
recognize,
but
be
that
as
it
may
if
i
might
say
it
that
ordinarily
for
example.
if
there’s
question
as
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest.
the
answer
is
generally
they
did
not
arrest
in
the
traditional
sense
of
the
word.
ordinarily
for
example
if
an
officer
makes
an
arrest
as
i
understand
the
underlying
english
decisions.
he
has
to
justify
on
the
position
he’s
taken,
here
they
did
not
justify
themselves
in
their
own
minds
at
least
that
they
were
arresting
for
the
crime
of
murder.
instead
on
the
instructions
of
the
district
attorney,
they
were
scraping
his
fingernails
for
evidence
and
i
think
the
probable
cause
there
comes
down
to
this
point.
ordinarily
on
a
search
for
evidence
or
to
get
probable
cause
for
warrant
let’s
say.
you
must
have
probable
cause
that
the
material
is
there,
here
as
the
officer
testified
that
he
had
no
idea
what
would
turn
up
until
he
get
a
lab
examination
and
that
he
would
have
done
this
to
any
suspect
no
matter
that
the
dark
spot
or
anything.
so
i
don’t
think
really
it
presents
the
correct
probable
question.
the
probable
cause
if
we
are
going
to
make
the
springboard
is
whether
the
material
was
present.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
he’s
in
the
presence
of
the
police,
they
can
restrain
anything
like
that
rather
than
--
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
i
would
say
not
according
to
the
definitions
that
this
court
gave
in
terry.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
well
davis,
i
don’t
consider
that
an
arrest
case,
i
consider
that
a
seizure
all
right.
this
is
a
seizure
case,
the
fourth
amendment
applies,
the
fourth
amendment
applies
in
terry.
they
seized
this
i
think
is
for
closest,
davis
is
the
closest
one
to
this
case,
they
seized
him
because
he
was
a
suspect.
they
finger
printed
him
without
warrant
and
therefore
this
court
held
that
that
was
illegal
and
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed.
i
think
that
applies
here,
he
is
a
suspect,
he
is
seized,
his
fingernails
were
scraped
without
a
warrant
and
therefore
it
violated
the
fourth
amendment
but
it’s
not
to
my
mind
an
arrest
because
they
certainly
didn’t
consider
it
an
arrest.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
yes,
terry
was
just
that
sort
of
a
case.
this
court
held
in
terry
that
it
wasn’t
an
arrest
but
it
had
to
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment.
there
had
to
be
sufficient
for
that
detention.
i
think
there’s
no
question
that
that’s
terry
all
the
way
through.
terry
was
not
an
arrest,
terry
was
not
arrested,
he
was
however
detained
and
this
court
said
the
fourth
amendment
applied.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
later
but
not
at
the
stopping.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
i
don’t
see
it,
they
have
a
stormy
marriage
that
is
hardly
grounds
for
--
he
was
somewhere
present
by
his
own
statement,
he
was
somewhere
present
but
this
other
business
like
a
cut
with
the
fingernails.
that
isn’t
what
the
evidence
is,
it
was
something
sharp
that
the
fingernails
of
the
son
were
bitten
but
when
would
it
been.
that
the
bed
was
made
up,
when
was
it
made
it
up?
after
she
was
killed?
the
doors
were
locked,
when
were
they
locked?
in
other
words,
the
evidence
to
me
is
highly
flimsy.
it’s
certainly
doesn’t
warrant
a
man
of
reasonable
probability
to
reach
that
conclusion
and
the
answer
is
the
police
did
not
do
it.
they
did
not
reach
the
conclusion
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
this
man,
they
did
not
arrest
him.
he
wasn’t
arrested
until
a
month
later
after
an
indictment
was
obtained.
they
discussed
it
with
the
district
attorney,
if
he
had
instructed
him
to
place
him
under
arrest
that
they
had
sufficient
they
would
have
placed
him
under
arrest.
the
case
has
shifted
its
ground,
it
was
an
exigent
circumstance
case,
now
the
state
had
later
on
made
an
attempt
to
make
a
probable
cause
case
but
it
was
probable
cause
to
search.
if
we
make
this
springboard
that
now
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
persons
and
houses
just
like
automobiles,
you
have
discarded
the
fourth
amendment.
if
you
make
exigent
circumstances
the
ground,
you
again
have
discarded
the
fourth
amendment
because
all
evidence
is
subject
to
destruction,
and
all
evidence
is
subject
to
destruction.
if
all
the
police
have
to
say
is
“i
feared
it
would
be
destroyed
and
therefore
i
searched”
you
have
discarded
the
magistrate,
you
have
discarded
the
warrant,
you
have
discarded
the
affidavit
of
probable
cause.
they
had
time
enough
to
call
a
deputy
district
attorney.
they
had
time
enough
to
call
a
magistrate.
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
police,
if
he
were
trying
to
spoil
evidence
they
could
have
restrained
him
from
doing
it.
this
court
allowed
the
detention
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
search
warrant
in
that
male
case.
well
is
it,
the
same
thing
applies
here
as
see.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
restrained
him
from
destroying
the
evidence?
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
apparently
not.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
they
called
the
deputy
district
attorney
and
asked
him
what
to
do.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
well
he
was
there.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
so
apparently
he
didn’t
make
any
serious
attempted
to
destroy
the
evidence
otherwise
he
probably
do
don’t
know.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
well
we
know
he
didn’t
make
a
successful
attempt
but
it
probably
could
have
been
serious
or
he
would
have
succeeded.
mr.
howard
r.
lonergan
well
they
said
that
what
motivated
him
they
said
that
he
was
a
suspect
and
they
would
have
done
it
to
any
suspect
and
they
had
as
i
say
they
had
time
enough
to
call
the
deputy
district
attorney
and
get
his
opinion
on
the
subject
and
follow
that.
they
had
time
enough
to
call
a
magistrate
and
get
his
authorization
and
that
that
would
have
complied.
i
see
it
really
no
different
from
davis
that
instead
of
getting
a
warrant
in
davis,
they
rounded
them
up
and
get
him.
if
you
are
going
to
say
exigent
circumstances,
you
have
discarded
the
fourth
amendment,
all
evidence
can
be
destroyed
and
as
to
the
probable
cause
can
i
say
if
we
are
going
to
jump
the
automobile
poised
for
flight
now
to
allow
searches
of
persons
and
i
assume
houses
on
probable
cause.
even
that
is
not
available
because
they
had
no
idea
what
they
would
find
as
they
testify
until
the
lab
examination.
mr.
howard
