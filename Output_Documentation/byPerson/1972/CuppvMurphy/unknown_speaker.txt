unknown

well
do
you
have
exactly
what
the
oregon

did
their?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do?
unknown
speaker
but
they
set
it
aside

assuming
there

and
we
can
proceed

which

you
say
it

it
was
an
arrest

know
this

there
was
probable
cause

you
have
to
consider
that
statement
there
is
a
justified
in
having
us
look
for
case
and
accepts
there.
unknown
speaker
no,
we
don’t
reached
those
questions,
but
normally
ask
the
