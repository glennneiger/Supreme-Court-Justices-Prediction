justice

stewart
he
was
detained
against
his
will
for
the
limited
time
necessary
to
take
the
scrapings
which
were
also
taken
against
his
will.
justice
potter
stewart
so
why
wasn’t
that
from
the
constitutional
point
of
view
an
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
it
might
not
have
been
from
the
point
of
view
of
oregon
law,
why
wasn’t
it
from
the
constitutional
point
of
view
and
arrest
just
as
in
davis
against
mississippi?
we
said
although
mississippi
says,
this
was
not
an
arrest,
this
was
only
a
dragnet
taking
people
into
a
court
to
take
the
finger
--
a
jailhouse
to
take
their
fingerprints.
we
said
from
the
constitutional
point
of
view,
yes
it
was
a
seizure
so
why
wasn’t
this?
justice
potter
stewart
in
mississippi
we
said
it
was
an
unreasonable
seizure
and
an
unreasonable
search
but
why
not
these
have
been
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
that
was
a
reasonable
one.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
keep
avoiding
that
in
your
brief,
you
said
they
wasn’t
arrested,
he
wasn’t
arrested,
he
wasn’t
arrested.
why
was
not
this
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view
an
arrest
just
as
it
was
in
davis?
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
seizure
to
use
the
constitutional
phrase.
justice
potter
stewart
a
seizure
would
be
in
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
the
seizure
upon
probable
cause
and
a
search
incident
to
that
reasonable
seizure
within
the
bounds
of
chimel
against
california,
why
isn’t
that
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
maybe
well
true
as
a
matter
of
oregon
law
just
as
in
louisiana,
they
said
that
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law
taking
that
young
man
davis
down
to
the
station
house
was
not
an
arrest,
i
am
sorry
the
mississippi
law.
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
said,
we
said
in
davis
against
mississippi
that
is
a
matter
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
so
it
was
a
seizure.
justice
potter
stewart
that
sounded
like
a
statement
but
i
was
asking
it
was
a
question.
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
was
a
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
detained
against
his
will
for
the
limited
