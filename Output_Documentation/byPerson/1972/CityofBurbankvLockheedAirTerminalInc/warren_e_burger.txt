you

well,
it’d
be
a
little
more
difficult
to
predict
the
pattern
of
private
aircraft,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
the
government
action
is
the
prohibition
by
the
federal
government
of
any
effort
on
the
part
of
the
local
people
to
protect
themselves?
chief
justice

this
sometimes
happens
even
in
fields
which
are
not
evolving
and
changing
fields,
doesn’t
it,
when
a
united
states
attorney
takes
a
position,
perhaps
in
the
southern
district
of
california,
and
when
the
case
finally
gets
to
you
in
washington
you
come
to
us
and
take
a
different
position
and
then
we
now
send
it
back
and
let
you
tell
the
government’s
to
the
trial
court
all
over.

thank

mr.
christopher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
christopher,
that
a
private
airport,
having
been
licensed,
becomes
something
of
a
common
carrier
in
the
sense
that
it
must
receive
all
flights
that
are
authorized
by
the
faa?
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
sieg,
i
think
we’ll
let
you
resume
and
not
to
split
your
argument.

four
minutes

half

what
page
are
you
on
in
that
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
other
language
in
that
letter.
i’m
not
sure
to
what
it
refers
to.
the
language
is
the
legislation,
and
i’m
not
sure
if
the
antecedent
operates
in
an
area
committed
to
federal
care
and
noise
limiting
rules
operating.
as
to
those
of
the
ordinance,
i
assume
that’s
the
hampstead
