mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
aviation
act
of
1958
is
the
corner
stone
of
the
statutory
scheme
here
involved,
and
i
think
we’ve
come
to
the
point
in
the
argument
where
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
stop
for
a
minute
and
consider
the
high
points
of
that
act,
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
act.
enacting
the
1958
act,
congress
responded
to
two
fundamental
and
closely
related
defects
in
the
prior
statutory
history.
first,
as
the
senate
committee
said
about
the
1958
act,
there
had
previously
been
a
diffusion
among
many
committees
and
boards.
second,
as
the
senate
committee
said,
there
was
a
lack
of
any
clear
authority
in
the
statute
for
centralized
airspace
management.
by
1958,
it’d
become
crucially
necessary
for
congress
to
do
something
about
this
situation.
there’d
been
a
vast
increase
in
air
traffic
and,
even
by
that
early
date,
congress
recognized
that
the
nation’s
airspace
was
a
diminishing
and
vital
natural
resource.
now,
to
correct
this
splintering
of
authority,
congress
vested
the
1958
act
on
questionable
authority
for
all
aspects
of
airspace
management
in
the
faa.
indeed,
congress
went
so
far
investing
this
plenary
authority
to
say
explicitly
the
administrator
of
the
faa
should
not
be
required
to
submit
his
decisions
regarding
airspace
to
any
other
organization.
in
addition
in
this
1958
act,
congress,
and
it’s
important
to
recognize
this,
authorized
the
administrator
to
issue
regulations
for
the
efficient
utilization
of
airspace,
as
well
as
for
the
safety
of
aircraft.
this
dual
purpose
runs
all
through
the
statute,
all
through
the
actions
of
the
administrator
the
purpose
of
achieving
safety
and
the
purpose
of
achieving
safety
and
the
purpose
of
having
an
efficient
use
of
a
navigable
airspace.
now,
in
the
1958
act,
congress
also
gave
the
faa
authority
to
issue
regulations
for
the
protection
of
persons
and
property
on
the
ground.
the
amicus
brief
for
the
united
states
vastly
understates
the
importance
of
this
provision
asserting
that
the
provision
was
only
designed
to
provide
protection
from
insecticides
sprayed
during
crop
dusting
and
saying
that
it
was
wholly
unrelated
to
congressional
consideration
of
the
aircraft
noise
problem.
this
is
a
demonstratively
faulty
reading
of
the
legislative
history
and,
unfortunately,
this
faulty
premise
infects
the
entire
government’s
argument.
the
government
has
failed,
in
its
characterization
of
this
section,
to
note
the
statements
in
the
1962
hearings
by
congressman
oren
harris,
the
long-time
chairman
of
the
commerce
committee
and
an
architect
of
the
1958
act
who
explicitly
said
that
that
provision
of
the
1958
act
was
addressed
to
the
problem
of
aircraft
noise.
he
said
that
the
problem
of
crop
dusting
was
not
to
so
reason
for
congress’
enactment
of
that
particular
section
but,
rather,
the
section
was
in
order
to
give
broad
rule
making
authority
to
the
faa
in
the
field
of
aircraft
noise.
the
government
is
also
wrong
as
a
matter
of
history
in
saying
that
the
authority
conferred
by
this
section
of
the
1958
act
was
used
only
at
a
few
noise
sensitive
airports.
the
fact
is,
as
cav
chairman
boyd
testified
noise
abatement
runway
patterns
were
established
under
this
section
at
every
major
airport
in
the
united
states
as
early
as
1962.
by
this
1958
act,
which
is
i
say
the
corner
stone
and
it
has
to
be
our
beginning
point
here,
congress
vested
in
the
faa
plenary
authority
for
airspace
management
and
the
regulation
of
aircraft
operations.
under
this
statutory
authority
of
the
administrator
of
the
faa
has
issued
regulations
which
have
been
described
as
being
a
formidable
proportions,
impressive
detail,
and
manifest
sophistication.
now,
to
understand
the
scope
of
the
breath
of
the
federal
control,
i’d
like
to
ask
you
to
consider
with
me,
as
one
of
the
witnesses
did
at
the
trial,
the
impact
of
federal
regulation
on
a
typical
flight
from
hollywood
burbank
airport
to
san
francisco.
in
the
example
i’m
using
here,
i’ve
chosen
a
flight
from
hollywood
burbank
to
san
francisco
because
that’s
the
most
frequent
destination,
but
the
scope
of
control
would
be
the
same
if
the
flight
had
gone
to
phoenix
or
on
the
burbank-seattle
route
or
any
other
commercial
flight.
perhaps
i
should
begin
the
description
of
this
imaginary
flight
by
saying
that
each
commercial
aircraft
on
this
route
has
an
airworthiness
certificate
and
it
has
a
type
certificate
not--
covering
not
only
the
airframe
and
the
engines,
but
every
appliance
on
the
aircraft,
and
each
aircraft
is
flow
in
accordance
with
operation
specifications
which
authorize
its
operation
into
and
out
of
each
airport
that
it
serves.
furthermore,
each
pilot
must
have
a
pilot
certificate
and
each
flight
engineer
must
be
certificated
by
the
faa.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
fundamental
difference
between
that
case
and
this,
your
honor,
is
that
in
that
case
the
federal
regulation
was
directed
solely
at
safety
on
the
seas
and
the
waterways.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
faa,
under
both
the
1958
act
and
the
1968
act,
is
explicitly
required
to
balance
not
only
those
interests,
environmental
interests
as
well.
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
faa
has
to
take
into
account
the
multiple
national
interest
involved:
national
defense,
aviation,
and
environmental
considerations,
and
that
is
a
fundamental
and
basic
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
huron
case.
if
i
can
continue
on
the
imaginary
flight
to
san
francisco,
i
think
it’s
important
to
know
that
long
before
this
flight
takes
place,
perhaps
so
much
as
30
days,
a
flight
plan
would’ve
been
filed
with
the
faa
or
traffic
control
center
for
southern
california,
the
center
that’s
responsible
for
managing
all
the
airspace
of
southern
california
which
stores
these
flight
plans
in
a
computer.
30
minutes
before
the
flight
takes
place,
the
faa
center
electronically
informs
the
faa
tower
at
hollywood
burbank
airport
of
the
anticipated
flight
so
the
tower
can
be
ready
to
give
the
necessary
clearances
to
the
pilot,
whether
the
pilot
gets
his
clearance
will
depend
upon
conditions
of
the
navigable
airspace.
these
conditions
are
frequently
abnormal
or
subnormal
depending
on
matters
such
as
weather,
congestion,
terminal
repairs,
and
accidents
or
a
combination
of
those
factors,
and
when
this
happens,
the
faa
control
center
for
southern
california
may
tell
the
faa
tower
at
hollywood
burbank
to
hold
that
aircraft
on
the
ground
or
to
modify
the
departure
in
some
respect.
now,
if
the
tower
at
burbank
is
not
directed
by
the
faa
center
to
hold
the
aircraft
on
the
ground
or
to
give
them
some
other
direction,
then
the
clearance
will
go
from
the
tower
to
the
pilot,
but
it’s
important
at
this
point
to
note
that
when
the
aircraft
is
loaded,
when
the
door
is
shut,
the
pilot
cannot
begin
to
taxi
on
the
runways
of
that
airport
until
the
faa
tower
clears
him
to
taxi,
clears
him
to
the
runway
which
is
assigned
for
that
flight.
the
runway
which
is
assigned
will
be
the
result
of
a
number
of
factors
including
federal
noise
abatement
procedures.
after
taxing
to
the
designated
runway,
the
pilot
must
get
a
further
clearance
for
takeoff
from
the
faa
tower.
i
think
it’s
important
for
our
purposes
to
notice
that
before
a
plane
can
take
off
into
the
navigable
airspace,
it
has
to
be
cleared
by
the
faa
tower.
the
faa
tower
acts
as
a
control
valve
regulating
access
to
the
navigable
airspace.
after
takeoff,
the
airplane
is
monitored,
directed,
supervised
very
closely
by
the
hollywood
burbank
tower
as
long
as
it’s
within
the
tower’s
airspace
and
it’s
transferred
to
the
center
for
southern
california.
about
halfway
to
san
francisco,
it’s
passed
off
to
the
oakland
center
which,
indeed,
then
monitors
it
with
great
care
and
precision,
until
it’s
in
the
vicinity
of
the
san
francisco
airport
and
then
the
faa
tower
at
san
francisco
guides
it
down
into
landing
and,
once
again,
into
the
taxiing
process.
it’s
by
no
means
a
high
privilege
to
say
that
every
aspect
of
this
flight,
from
the
planning
for
it
as
much
as
30
days
ahead,
the
entry
into
navigable
airspace
and
everyday
detail
of
the
execution
of
the
flight
is
supervised
by
the
federal
airspace
manager,
the
faa.
now,
it’s
our
basic
position
which
i’ll
be
reiterating
here.
if
there
are
to
be
restrictions
imposed
on
the
entry
into
the
navigable
airspace,
they
should
come
from
the
federal
agency
which
has
been
authorized
by
the
congress
to
weight
the
national
interest
involved
and
determine
whether
or
not
those
restrictions
should
be
imposed.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
justice,
that
raises
the
question
which
is
not
here
as
to
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
power
of
an
airport
proprietor.
that
power,
being
based
upon
ancient
property
concepts,
would
no
doubt
depend
somewhat
on
the
law
of
each
state.
but,
beyond
that,
i
would
want
to
say
that
although
the
question
is
not
here,
there
would
be
important
barriers
at
several
levels
to
that
action.
first,
there
might
be
constitutional
barriers.
such
a
curfew
might
well
involve
an
abridgment
of
rights
under
the
commerce
clause.
second,
such
a
proposal
might
well
be
in
conflict
with
federal
law
in
some
respect.
and,
finally,
i
think
that
it’s
worthwhile
saying
that
there
may
be
contractual
provisions
that
would
prevent
the
establishment
of
such
a
curfew
by
the
proprietor.
that
question
is
not
here.
unquestionably,
the
proprietor
has
been
saved
from
the
full
scope
of
the
preemption
under
the
1968
act
of
what
the
scope
of
the
proprietor’s
rights
are
as
not
yet
determined.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
the
private
airport
would
be
in
substantially
the
same
situation
as
other
public
airports,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
they
had
established
service
and
if
the
ending
of
that
service
would
involve
a
violation
of
commerce
clause,
i
can
see
the
possibility
of
insistence
on
the
continuation
of
that
service.
there’s
no
question,
but
once
a
private
airport
undertakes
to
begin
to
serve
the
public,
it
has
obligations
it
may
continue.
that
would
be
particularly
true
if
that
private
airport
had
received
federal
funds
for
control
tower
and
other
navigational
equipment,
but
not
for
its
runways.
as
i
move
forward
in
this
preemption
argument,
i
think
it’s
very
significant
to
me
that
the
united
states
concedes
in
its
brief
that
airspace
management
is
an
exclusively
federal
responsibility.
in
our
view,
and
we
believe
in
the
view
of
congress,
airspace
management
is
a
comprehensive
and
invisible
concept
which
includes
all
regulation
of
the
use
of
navigable
airspace.
any
entity
we
say
which
regulates
the
hours
that
air
traffic
may
flow
into
the
navigable
airspace
is
inevitably
involved
in
airspace
management.
to
allow
local
entities
to
regulate
this
flow
would,
we
say,
fractionalize
airspace
management
and
direct
our
position
to
the
congressional
purpose.
a
curfew
acts
as
a
blockade
on
traffic
in
a
manner
which
we
think
is
sharply
inconsistent
with
the
efficient
operation
of
the
system.
we
all
know
that
the
congestion
with
its
attendant
threats
to
safety
and
efficiency
is
one
of
the
principle
problems
of
our
transportation
system,
yet
curfew
not
only
increase
congestion
but
they
aggravate
it
in
the
hours
on
the
shoulders
of
the
curfews
where
the
congestion
is
already
the
worst.
those
are
particularly
the
hours
between
6
and
10
in
the
evening.
the
adverse
effects
of
a
curfew
are
greatly
aggravated,
greatly
multiplied
in
a
country
as
broad
as
ours
where
the
impact
is
spread
over
six
time
zones
unless
magnified
because
of
the
effect
of
the
time
zones
on
scheduling.
once
again,
to
come
back
to
the
central
point,
restrictions
so
severe
and
debilitating
to
the
system
as
a
curfew
and,
as
we
believe
a
curfew
to
be,
should
be
imposed,
if
at
all,
only
by
the
agency
entrusted
by
congress
with
overall
airspace
management.
now,
i’ve
been
at
some
pain
as
to
discuss
the
1958
act--
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
federal
government
acting
through
the
federal
aviation
agency
and
the
manager,
being
the
manager
of
national
airport,
has
established
a
curfew
at
national
airport.
now
at
that
national
airport,
the
curfew
is
established
by
the
proprietor
of
that
airport
by
the
federal
government
in
its
role
as
airspace
manager.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
the
federal
aviation
agency
has
not
established
curfews
at
any
of
the
airports
around
the
country.
indeed,
the
faa
has
chosen
another
strategy.
they
have
chosen
the
strategy
of
runway
use
patterns
to
minimize
the
noise.
they’ve
chosen
the
strategy
of
special
techniques
for
landing
and
takeoffs.
they’ve
chosen
the
strategy
of
special
departure
patterns,
but
they
have
not
adopted
or
imposed
a
curfew
in
any
place
in
the
country,
and
i
think--
mr.
warren
christopher
i
certainly
don’t
agree
that
they
haven’t
done
anything
about
noise
abatement.
i
think
they
have
done
all
that
they
could
do
within
the
state
of
the
art.
i’ve
dwelled--
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
your
honor,
i
could
not
agree
that
they’ve
done
nothing
there.
they’ve
established
a
runway
use
program
and
the
planes
now
takeoff
on
the
least
sensitive
of
the
runways,
and
they’re
required
to
do
so.
the
local
airport
faa
tower
chief
has
established
this
runway
use
procedure
which,
in
his
judgment,
is
the
best
way
to
minimize
the
noise
at
night.
now,
i’ve
dwelled
on
the
scope
of
the
1958
act
because
i
think
it’s
a
crucial
backdrop
for
the
1968
amendment
by
congress.
in
1968,
congress
adopted
an
amendment
which
explicitly
provided
that
the
administrator
of
the
faa
shall
prescribe
regulations
for
the
control
and
abatement
of
aircraft
noise.
in
the
hearings
on
that
bill,
the
secretary
of
transportation
was
asked
about
the
status
of
local
and
state
governments
under
the
amendment.
he
asked
time
to
submit
a
letter.
he
submitted
a
letter.
the
letter
was
adopted
by
the
senate
committee
and
it’s
become
a
focal
point
in
this
litigation.
now
this
letter,
as
justices
already
pointed
out,
makes
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
police
powers
of
local
and
state
governments
and
the
proprietary
power
of
an
airport
operator.
as
to
police
powers,
the
letter
says
state
and
local
governments
will
remain
unable
to
use
their
police
powers
to
control
aircraft
noise.
in
contrast,
the
letter
says
airport
owners
operating
as
proprietors
will
retain
rights
to
take
certain
actions
with
respect
to
noise.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes.
your
honor,
it’s
printed
at
the
back
of
the--
mr.
warren
christopher
no,
it’s
printed
at
the
back
of
the
burbank
brief,
your
honor,
the
appellants’
brief.
mr.
warren
christopher
we’re
at
least
partly
responsible
for
that,
your
honor.
this
is
the--
mr.
warren
christopher
the
back
of
the
grey
brief
of
the
appellants’--
their
main
brief,
and
it’s
in
the
first
appendix.
the
sentences
i’m
referring
to,
your
honor,
are
on
page
1
which
is
an
unnumbered
page.
mr.
warren
christopher
but,
down
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
you
see
the
sentences,
hr3400
would
merely
expand
the
government’s
role
in
a
field
already
preempted.
it
would
not
change
this
preemption.
state
and
local
governments
will
remain
unable
to
use
their
police
powers
to
control
aircraft
noise
by
regulating
the
flight
of
aircraft.
mr.
warren
christopher
and,
however,
the
proposed
legislation
will
not
affect
the
rights
of
a
state
and
local
public
agency
as
a
proprietor
of
an
airport,
and
so
on.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
the
senate
committee
which
he
submitted
after
he’d
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
submit
a
letter,
and
this
was
adopted
by
the
senate
committee
which
issued
the
authoritative
report
on
this
legislation,
adopted
by
this
senate
committee
as
its
statement
of
the
rights
of
local
and
state
government.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
sir.
he
was
over
there
testifying.
mr.
warren
christopher
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
christopher
as
its
statement
of
the
respective
rights
of
the
local
and
state
governments.
you
see,
your
honor,
it--
the
beginning
of
the
appendix
section
which
we
have
been
reading
together,
the
senate
committee
said
“in
this
regard,
we
concur
in
the
following
views
set
forth
by
the
secretary
in
his
letter
to
the
committee.”
continuing
then,
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
same
distinction
is
made
in
the
unpublished
letter
from
the
department
of
transportation
to
congressman
fidel
which
the
united
states
has
printed
as
an
appendix
to
its
amicus
brief.
that’s
the
grey
brief.
now,
at
page
67
of
that
grey
brief,
i
think
it’s
quite
significant
to
look
at
the
sentence
in
the
middle
of
the
page
where,
once
again,
the
department
of
transportation
was
telling
congress,
this
time
the
other
house
of
congress,
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
ata
concedes
in
its
testimony
that
only
regulatory
authority
left
to
local
communities
or
airport
operators
is
the
authority
of
the
airport
operator
in
the
exercise
of
its
proprietary
function
to
limit
on
noise
grounds
the
kind
of
aircraft
which
may
use
its
facility.
it’s
hard
for
me
to
imagine
a
clearer
statement
of
the
distinction
between
proprietary
power
and
police
power
that
it’s
embodied,
first,
in
the
letter
of
the
secretary
to
the
senate
committee,
and
then
in
this
more
recently
available
letter
from
dot
to
congressman
fidel.
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i’m
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
address
that
question.
i’ve
noted
it
when
you
asked
it
of
others.
although
this
is
one
of
the
few
privately
owned
airports
in
the
country,
nevertheless,
the
distinction
will
be
very
important
to
many
publicly
owned
airports
for
although
many
cities
own
and
operate
airports,
they
very
frequently
own
and
operate
them
in
areas
outside
of
their
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
warren
christopher
that’s
right,
and
we’ve
shown
in
our
brief
at
page
35
and
36
the
very
many
examples
there
are
of
airports
which
are
operated
by
cities
or
by
counties
but
which
exists,
at
least
all
or
in
part,
in
other
jurisdictions:
san
francisco,
baltimore,
cincinnati,
atlanta.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
question
is
here,
mr.
justice.
in
response
to
the
government’s
argument,
it
will
be
so
bizarre
to
have
the
preemption
be
this
narrow.
preemption
is
very
important,
not
just
to
burbank
but
to
any
city
airport
which
is
operated
in
an
area
not
wholly
within
its
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
warren
christopher
others
might,
mr.
justice,
but
this
own
certainly
would
and
i
think
that’s
a
fundamental
position
that
we’ll
be
taking
throughout
the
case.
now,
the
distinction
we’re
talking
about
here
is
not
at
all
an
irrational
one.
indeed,
the
distinction
is
rooted
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
griggs
versus
allegheny
county.
as
we
all
know,
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
the
airport
proprietor
has
to
pay
the
bill
if
flights
are
held
to
have
constituted
taking
from
this
land
owner--
the
land
owner’s
property.
because
the
airport
proprietor
must
bear
the
liability,
congress
created
this
narrow
exemption
from
federal
preemption
so
that
the
proprietor
could
protect
himself.
it
reserved
these
rights
to
the
proprietor,
but
it
did
not
reserve
them
to
cities
because
the
reason
for
the
distinction,
the
reason
for
the
narrow
exemption
from
preemption
did
not
exist
for
the
cities.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes.
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
scope
of
the
proprietor’s
rights
depends
upon
state
law,
and
you’d
have
to
examine
very
carefully
whether
or
not
there
might
be
some
conflict
with
existing
federal
regulation.
you’d
have
to
also
examine
whether
or
not
the
enactment
of
such
a
curfew
or
the
imposition
of
it
by
an
airport
operator
would
rather
follow
the
commerce
clause
or
of
contractual--
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that’s
more
true
of
preemption
than
it
is
of
conflict.
if
there
is
an
explicit
faa
order
saying
that
the
airport
shall
remain
open
at
night,
it
might
find
that
that
would
run
a
foul
of
what
the
proprietor
did
here.
i
would
say
that,
while
preemption
and
the
full
rigors
of
preemption
may
not
be
visited
on
the
airport
proprietor,
the
conflict
doctrine
remains.
the
federal
law
would
be
supreme
if
the
federal
government
imposed
a
restriction
which
is
absolutely
contrary
to
what
the
proprietor
has
done.
mr.
warren
christopher
there
is
no
such
restriction.
mr.
warren
christopher
that
certainly
is
our
position,
your
honor.
i
simply
did
not
want
to
mislead
the
court
because
i
think
that
question
will
come
up
with
the
record
that
indicates--
will
indicate
there
may
be
problems
under
the
constitution
of
a
different
character
or
problems
under
the
contracts
of
a
different
character.
i
think
that
question
is
not
here
and
it
may
be
quite
a
difficult
question
when
it
comes.
mr.
warren
christopher
not
at
all.
i
think
it’s
a
very
important
reservation
of
power
that
airport
proprietors
will
be
exercising
and
have
indeed
exercised
in
the
past,
as
the
port
of
new
york
authority’s
brief
indicates.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
all
the
things
that
were
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
they
created
the
distinction,
but
certainly
that
one
thing
was
in
the
mind
of
congress,
as
you
can
see
from
the
committee
reports
and
the
letter
to
the
committee
by
dot.
now,
the
briefs
of
our
adversaries
have
a
difficult
time
with
this
legislative
history.
the
brief
reflecting
the
views
the
department
of
transportation
advised
to
discount
on
the
ground
that
congress
did
not
focus
on
the
distinction,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
strange
position
for
an
agency
which
advanced
the
distinction
and
persuaded
congress
to
accept
it
to
be
taking.
united
states
also
argues
that
it
would
be
bizarre
to
have
the
federal
preemption
apply
only
to
a
few
private
airports,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
federal
preemption
operates
with
respect
to
all
airports,
both
public
and
private,
and
it
prevents
the
exercise
of
local
police
power
to
control
aircraft
operations
at
those
airports
whether
they’re
publicly
owned
or
privately
owned.
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
situation
very
frequently
exists
that
an
airport
owner
must
face
the
fact
that
he
is
in
the
jurisdiction
of
more
than
one
entity
and
he
may
be
in
a
jurisdiction
of
quite
a
different
entity
then
his
public
body,
the
public
body
of
which
he
is
a
member,
and
this
situation
exists
all
over
the
country.
with
respect
to
the
hollywood
burbank
airport,
to
pick
up
on
a
question
from
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
even
that
airport
is
subject
to
two
jurisdictions:
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
the
city
of
burbank,
and
they
might
well
enact
conflicting
or
inconsistent
regulations
which
would
have
a
very
great
potential
for
interference
with
the
national
air
transportation
system.
as
my
time
is
going
here,
i’d
like
to
move
next
to
the
conflict
issue
which
i
think
is
very
significant
in
this
case.
it
was
an
issue
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
itself
unanimous.
now,
the
conflict
arises
here
because,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
burbank
ordinance,
the
faa
had
focused
on
the
subject
of
nighttime
takeoffs
and
issued
a
noise
abatement
order.
by
this
order,
they
established
a
certain
runway
as
the
noise
abatement
runway
which
was
to
be
used
between
11
p.m.
and
7
a.m.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
order
represented
a
considered
determination
by
the
faa
that
the
burbank
order
is
below
the
lowest
practical
minimum.
the
tower
chief
had
announced
that
the
noise
abatement
procedures
contained
in
this
order
were
designed
to
reduce
noise
exposure
to
the
lowest
practical
minimum
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
followed
that
up
by
saying
that
the
order
represented
a
considered
determination
that
the
burbank
order
was
beneath
the
lowest
practical
minimum
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
because
this
was
so,
the
burbank
order
interfered
with
the
balance
set
by
the
faa
in
accordance
with
the
power
vested
in
it
by
congress.
now,
the
united
states
attempts
to
attack
this
conflict
holding
by
saying
that
the
faa
order
simply
did
not
represent
any
consideration
of
a
locally
administered
curfew.
the
government
doesn’t
offer
any
citation
of
authority
for
this
simply
did
not
consider
statement
and
there
is
none.
on
the
contrary,
the
district
judge
who
heard
the
testimony
of
the
tower
chief
and
the
other
witnesses
found
that,
in
issuing
the
order,
the
faa
had
taken
in
hand
the
subject
of
nighttime
takeoffs.
we
don’t
need
to
guess
about
the
views
of
the
faa
with
respect
to
this
order,
and
their
amicus
briefs
in
the
lower
court,
the
faa
cited,
appended,
and
relied
on
this
order
which
the
court
of
appeals
then
found
to
be
in
conflict.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
the
faa
order
was
substantially
before
the
enactment
of
the
ordinance.
now,
in
trying
to
avoid
this
conflict
which
the
court
of
appeals
found,
the
brief
for
the
united
states
asserts
the
opposition
to
a
curfew
at
burbank
by
the
faa
would’ve
constituted
a
major
change
in
policy.
we
say,
not
at
all.
at
appendix
2
of
our
brief,
this
blue
supplemental
brief,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
examples.
in
recent
years
which
the
faa
has
gone
on
record
as
being
opposed
to
curfews
at
various
airports
around
the
country
in
southern
california,
in
texas,
and
new
york
state.
one
of
the
most
significant
examples
occurred
right
in
los
angeles
where,
in
1960,
the
faa
explicitly
considered
a
nighttime
restriction
and
decided
against
it
because
of
the
serious
problems
that
it
posed
for
the
national
air
transportation
system.
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i
know
of
none.
the
only
curfew
imposed
by
the
faa
of
which
i
know
is
the
one
at
washington
national.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
that’s
a
voluntary
agreement,
but
the
most
significant
aspect
of
it,
to
me,
is
imposed
by
the
airport
proprietor
and
it’s
imposed
by
the
national
airspace
manager
of
the
federal
aviation
agency.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
by
all
means,
your
honor.
you
know,
there
are
only--
there
are
over
10,000
landing
fields
in
the
united
states.
there
are
over
346
of
those
landing
fields
that
have
faa
towers
and
there’re
about
140
airports
which
are--
air
carrier
airports
which
serve
more
than
100,000
people
a
year.
now,
i
certainly
would
not
contend
that
each
of
these
10,000
airports
need
to
be
operated
all
night.
i
would--
mr.
warren
christopher
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
many
of
them
do
not
have
lights.
mr.
warren
christopher
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
is
a
question
of
power,
not
a
question
of
whether
there
should
be
curfews
but
who
has
power
to
impose
them.
now,
our
basic
argument
is
that
if
curfews
are
to
be
imposed,
they
represent
such
a
severe
and
debilitating
affect
on
the
national
air
transportation
system
that
they
should
be
imposed
only
by
a
centralized
agency.
now,
the
city
of
burbank
attacks
the
conflict
on
one
other
ground
i
need
to
note.
burbank
claims
that
the
procedures
set
forth
in
this
faa
order
are
non-mandatory.
the
record,
however,
is
to
the
contrary.
the
record
shows
the
procedures
became
mandatory
through
incorporation
into
the
aircraft’s
clearance.
thus,
the
district
judge
explicitly
found
that
the
preferential
runway
assignment
is
incorporated
to
the
aircraft’s
clearance
as
an
instruction
to
the
pilot.
if
the
pilot
violates
this
instruction,
he
becomes
subject
to
a
civil
penalty
and
he
may
become
subject
to
revocation
of
his
license.
testimony
in
trial
court
showed
that
this
runway
procedure
which
was
embodied
in
the
faa
order
was
followed
except
on
a
few
occasions
when
the
tower
itself
permitted
a
deviation
because
of
weather
or
other
operating
conditions
affecting
safety.
so
the
net
of
the
matter,
as
we
see
it,
is
the
faa
order
is
a
considered
determination
regarding
nighttime
takeoffs
by
the
agency
empowered
to
do
so
and,
therefore,
is
in
conflict
with
the
burbank
ordinance.
the
remaining
time,
i
at
least,
as
far
as
my
portion
of
the
argument
go,
i’d
like
to
discuss
the
commerce
issues
which
seem
to
me
to
have
been
perhaps
not
adequately
attended
to
up
to
this
point,
certainly
not
by
me.
the
commerce
clause
has
two
separate
and
independent
aspects,
and
i
think
they
both
deserve
a
great
deal
of
consideration.
the
first
aspect
relates
to
the
holding
of
the
district
court.
the
burbank
ordinance
operates
in
an
area
where
regulation
must
be
prescribed
by
a
single
authority
and,
therefore,
the
commerce
clause
standing
alone
invalidates
the
ordinance
under
the
rule
laid
down
in
southern
pacific
versus
arizona.
the
test
under
this
phase
of
the
commerce
clause
is
not
whether
regulations
at
each
airport
must
be
precisely
the
same.
we
recognize,
as
i
was
saying
a
minute
ago,
that
different
airports
would
require
different
treatment.
the
test
is
whether
regulation
should
come,
in
this
instance,
from
a
single
authority,
and
we
say
that
it
must
because
of
the
volume
of
air
commerce,
the
speed
in
which
it’s
conducted,
and
the
technical
complexity
of
airline
scheduling
and
aircraft
maintenance.
only
through
the
uniform
application
of
a
national
policy,
through
centralized
control
by
a
federal
agency
can
we
properly
cope
with
issue
in
the
form
of
transportation.
mr.
warren
christopher
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
christopher
basic
interrelationship,
and
we
say
that
that
is
a
reason
independent
of
burden--
independent
of
a
burden
analysis
for
holding
here
that
the
commerce
clause
requires
that
these
restrictions
be
imposed,
if
at
all,
by
a
centralized
authority.
now,
the
national
character
of
the
system
which
justice
stewart
was
just
referring
to
is
demonstrated
very
clearly
by
the
faa’s
flow
control
system.
flow
control
involves
the
metering
of
aircrafts
so
as
to
cope
with
congestion
or
weather
or
other
impediments
to
interstate
commerce.
now,
this
flow
control,
as
i
illustrated
in
my
imaginary
trip,
may
involve
holding
aircraft
on
the
ground
at
various
airports.
it
may
involve
establishing
a
special
separation
between
them
in
a
navigable
airspace.
the
flow
control
was
initiated
by
the
faa
in
1969
and,
at
that
time,
they
made
it
the
responsibility
of
the
faa
center
in
each
one
of
the
regions
of
the
country.
however,
only
a
few
months
after
flow
control
was
put
in
by
the
faa,
the
faa
found
it
essential
to
establish
a
centralized
flow
control
center
in
washington
d.c.
to
provide
coordination
of
these
flow
control
decisions.
the
faa
found
that
none
of
the
regional
centers
had
enough
information
to
make
wise
decisions
for
the
system
as
a
whole,
and
i
would
say
and
emphasize
that
if
national
coordination
is
necessary
for
the
flow
control,
it
is
vastly
more
necessary
for
such
a
lasting
restriction
of
airports
as
would
be
a
night
curfew.
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
in
1971
the
department
of
transportation
took
almost
precisely
the
same
position
with
respect
to
the
commerce
issue,
as
i’ve
been
asserting
here.
this
position
was
taken
on
a
brief
filed
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
and,
with
your
permission,
i’ll
read
just
one
or
two
sentences
from
it.
air
transportation
said
to
dot,
perhaps
more
than
any
other
form
of
commerce
requires
regulation
by
a
single
authority.
even
before
600-mile
per
hour
flights
became
the
custom,
congress
recognized
this
need
by
the
establishment
of
the
federal
aviation
agency.
and
to
continue
this
sentence
from
the
dot’s
brief,
it
would
indeed
be
a
harmful
and
regressive
step
to
admit
a
compromise
of
the
faa’s
authority
to
permitting
the
enforcement
of
local
laws
or
regulations
regarding
the
use
of
navigable
airspace.
this
brief
filed
by
the
dot
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
is
quoted
in
full
in
the
answering
brief
of
the
port
of
new
york
authority.
now,
i
certainly
don’t
challenge
the
right
of
the
government
to
change
its
position
in
this
matter.
i
have
no
criticism
of
it,
but
i
hope
it
won’t
be
improper
for
me
to
say
it
seems
to
me
they
were
right
the
first
time.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
an
advisory
opinion
of
the
justices
with
respect
to
a
legislation
banning
a
certain
supersonic
aircraft
from
massachusetts.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
court--
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
net
of
this
first
argument
under
the
commerce
clause
is
our
view
that
independent
of
other
aspects
of
the
discussion
today,
independent
of
preemption,
independent
of
conflict,
independent
of
the
burden
aspect
of
the
commerce
clause
that,
under
southern
pacific
versus
arizona,
the
court
should
find
that
air
commerce,
because
of
its
speed
and
complexity,
requires
centralized
management.
the
other
aspect
of
the
commerce
argument
involves
the
holding
of
the
district
court
that
local
ordinances
would
constitute
and
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
this
is
the
burden
issue.
the
decisions
of
this
court
teach
us
that
an
ordinance
such
as
burbanks
cannot
be
considered
as
an
isolated
phenomenon,
but
must
be
weighed
and
tested
as
if
imposed
on
a
national
basis.
this
rule
has
been
uniformly
applied,
i
believe,
in
decisions
of
this
court
and
it’s
especially
appropriate,
as
this
court
has
said,
where
the
restriction
might
interfere
with
the
efficient
use
of
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce.
for
instance,
in
the
southern
pacific
case,
the
court
said
that
it
had
to
consider
the
consequences
if
all
50
states
had
sought
to
regulate
train
lines.
similarly,
in
hood
&
sons
versus
du
mond,
this
court
considered
the
effect
on
commerce
if
other
states
were
to
have
adopted
regulations
comparable
to
those
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
milk
industry.
in
this
particular
case,
the
importance
of
considering
local
curfews
on
a
national
basis
is
emphasized
by
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that,
if
upheld
here,
curfews
will
proliferate
and
be
adopted
by
virtually
all
cities
surrounding
airports.
it’s
a
very,
very
contagious
business.
several
witnesses
have
testified
to
this
contagious
character
of
the
curfews
and
there
seems
little
doubt
that
many
cities,
as
reported
in
the
press,
are
watching
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
and
will
enact
curfews
if
they
are
upheld
here.
now,
the
government
takes
a
rather
unusual
position
that
the
nationwide
effects
of
a
restriction
on
commerce
might
be
appropriate
in
some
cases,
but
is
not
appropriate
here.
i
think
this
an
assertion
on
their
part
that
some
support
it
and
i
find
no
support
for
it
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
moreover,
the
government
even
reveals
some
doubt
about
its
own
theory
when
it
says
in
a
footnote
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
consider
a
curfew
in
relation
to
existing
curfews
when
weighing
it
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
you’ll
soon
see
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
theory
which
produced
very
extraordinary
results.
presumably,
the
footnote
means
that,
at
some
point,
a
proliferation
of
curfews
could
result
in
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
does
that
mean
if
there
are10
curfews
creating
a
violation
of
all
10
are
invalid,
or
does
it
mean
the
10th
one
is
invalid
and
the
first
ones
are
valid,
thus,
creating
a
race
to
the
city
council
to
see
who
can
get
there
first
or
does
it
mean,
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
10th
one
makes
the
1st
one
invalid
but
the
10th
one
continues
to
be
valid
itself.
well,
i
think
you
can
see
that
the
irrationality
of
the
results
from
such
a
test
confirms
the
wisdom
of
this
court’s
longstanding
rule
that
restrictions
on
commerce
should
be
judged
as
if
applied
nationally.
evaluated
on
a
national
basis--
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
the
bibb
case
is
very
much
in
point.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
restrictions
on
commerce,
especially
those
which
interfere
with
the
national
system,
must
be
weighed
and
tested
as
if
imposed
on
a
national
basis.
evaluated
on
a
national
basis,
the
record
seems,
to
me,
to
demonstrate
overwhelmingly
that
night
curfews
would
cause
massive
disruptions
in
commerce.
curfew
on
jet
takeoffs
alone
without
a
curfew
on
landing,
simply
a
curfew
on
takeoffs
alone
like
the
burbank
curfew
would
require
cancellation
of
more
than
1,000
flights
every
single
night.
because
over
48%
of
the
airmail
moves
at
night,
a
curfew
would
delay
not
millions
but
billions
of
pieces
of
mail
at
least
one
day,
a
delay
which
is
certainly
in
sure
of
conflict
with
our
postal
policy
which
says
overnight
transportation
of
letter
mail
is
the
primary
goal
of
postal
operations.
the
effect
of
a
night
curfew
on
air
cargo
service
would
be
equally
drastic.
42%
of
air
cargo
moves
at
night
and,
indeed
the
whole
industry
exists
depending
upon
its
ability
to
move
cargo
on
an
overnight
basis
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
the
other,
and
i
think
we
can
see
that
the
imposition
of
curfews
on
a
nationwide
basis
would
have
a
severe
hobbling
effect
if
it
wouldn’t
completely
destroy
this
growing
air
cargo
industry.
continental
airlines,
one
of
the
carriers
serving
hollywood
burbank
airport,
made
a
thorough
study
of
the
financial
effect
of
the
imposition
of
a
burbank
curfew
on
its
entire
system.
continental
airlines
found
its
operating
cost
would
be
increased
by
more
than
25%
if
there
were
a
curfew
throughout
its
system.
it
would
be
required
alone
to
cancel
48
flights
a
night
and
it
would
have
to
purchase
six
new
jet
aircrafts
to
replace
the
cancelled
services.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
justice,
continental
just
commenced
its
service
at
hollywood
burbank
when
this
case
was
tried.
it
was
affected
in
the
sense
that
its
witnesses
or
its
witness
testified
that
it
was
inhibited
from
filling
out
its
service
pattern
on
a
flight
from
seattle
back
to
burbank
or
would
have
been
if
the
curfew
was
in
effect,
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
was
too
early
in
continentalm
airline
service
at
hollywood
burbank
for
it
to
have
really
felt
the
effect
of
the
curfew
on
it.
now,
i’d
like
to
briefly
recur
to
one
or
two
of
the
points
made
earlier
in
the
argument.
with
respect
to
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
act
is
not
at
all
consistent
with
the
result
below.
that
act
requires
federal
agencies
to
consider
environmental
matters
in
their
decision
making
process,
but
it
also
explicitly
provides
congress
shall
not
exclude
other
essential
considerations
of
national
policy
in
determining
what
policy
shall
be
imposed
finally
by
the
federal
agency.
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
in
a
sense,
duplicates
the
1968
amendment
with
respect
to
aircraft
noise.
under
both
nepa
and
the
1968
amendment,
the
faa
must
and
does
take
into
account
environmental
factors
in
its
decision
making,
but
neither
this
statute
nor
the
other
statute
cited
was
intended
to
make
environmental
factors
controlling
over
all
other
factors.
similarly,
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
the
environmental
quality
improvement
act
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
result
below
nor
is
it
a
statement
that
stated
state
and
local
government
shall
have
primary
responsibility
for
implementing
national
environmental
policy.
these
general
expressions
of
congressional
intent
can
hardly
overcome
the
special
responsibilities
which
have
been
imposed
upon
federal
agencies,
in
particular
the
faa,
by
congress
in
the
1958
act,
the
1962
act,
and
again
in
the
1972
act.
there’s
been
a
reference
here
also
to
the
1972
noise
control
act,
and
i
think
i
should
briefly
mention
that
the
1972
act
does
nothing
to
alter
the
power
relationships
as
they
were--
existed
prior
to
that
act
and
as
they
were
imposed
by
the
1958
and
1968
act.
in
the
1972
act,
congress
reaffirmed
its
intention
to
the
look--
to
the
faa
for
rulemaking
in
the
noise
abatement
field.
the
epa,
under
that
new
act,
is
called
upon
to
use
its
expertise
to
recommend
regulations,
but
authority
to
issue
the
regulations
is
retained
in
the
faa.
and
in
deciding
what
regulations
to
issue,
that
1972
act
again
directs
the
faa
to
balance
the
multiple
national
interests
involved.
both
the
house
and
senate
report
on
the
1972
act
stressed
that
it
was
not
intended
to
change
the
law
with
respect
to
the
respective
authorities
of
the
local
and
state
governments,
the
federal
government,
and
the
airport
proprietors
as
they
existed
before.
i
confess
to
being
somewhat
puzzled
by
the
assertion
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
roe
versus
wade.
looking
again
at
the
slip
opinion
of
that
case,
seems
to
me
that,
and
the
court
of
course
will
be
much
more
familiar
with
its
holding
than
i
am,
there,
a
state
statute
had
invaded
a
personal
zone
of
privacy
and
was,
therefore,
struck
down
as
unconstitutional.
the
court
held
that
the
right
to
personal
privacy
includes
the
abortion
decision.
it’s
rather
baffled
to
me
as
to
how
this
can
vindicate
the
ordinance
before
the
court.
now,
this
case
does
not
deal
with
any
claim
of
invasion
of
personal
rights
as
it
deals
with
the
validity
of
a
local
municipal
ordinance.
if
there’d
been
a
fifth
amendment
taking
or
some
other
sort
of
a
taking,
the
property
owners
might
have
brought
an
action,
but
that
case
has
not
been--
not
here
and
has
not
been
done.
so,
i
could
only
express
at
least
some
puzzlement
as
to
the
effect
of
that
particular
argument
on
the
issues
before
the
court.
there
has
been
some
discussion
here
also
stressing
that
neither
the
statute
nor
the
regulations
involved
specifically
deal
with
curfews
that
they
neither
prevent
them
nor
imposed
them
and,
therefore,
the
locally
imposed
curfews
must
be
permitted.
i
think
if
we
look
back
at
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we’ll
find
that
that
argument
is
not
borne
out.
the
leading
case
on
this
point
is
napier
versus
atlantic
coastline,
272
us
605,
where
the
court
held
that
it
was
without
legal
significance,
i
believe
that
was
mr.
justice
brandeis
who
held
it
was
without
legal
significance
that
there
was
no
explicit
federal
provision
inconsistent
with
the
local
legislation.
the
napier
case
itself,
as
the
court
will
remember,
the
court
struck
down
a
state
statute
on
automatic
fire
boxed
doors
for
locomotives
even
though
the
icc
had
not
dealt
with
that
subject.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
i
know
the
cases.
mr.
warren
christopher
i
don’t
think
they’re
inconsistent
with
the
result
here,
your
honor.
in
every
instance,
you
go
back
to
what
was
the
intention
of
congress,
did
congress
intend
to
preempt
the
field
and,
were
it
hesitant
to
preempt
the
field,
the
fact
that
the
administrative
agency
has
not
issued
an
explicit
regulation
on
the
subject
involved
does
not
prevent
the
subject
involved
from
being
held
to
be
within
the
preempted
area.
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i
think
if--
there
was
reliance
in
those
cases,
but
it
was
reliance
in
order
to
try
to
eliminate
the
intention
of
congress.
the
failure
of
congress
to
touch
a
subject,
of
course,
is
the
touchstone
here
and
it’s
what
we’re--
what
the
whole
discretion
is
about.
i’d
mentioned
in
passing
also
that
the
napier
case,
followed
by
the
bethlehem
steel
case
in
330
us
767,
once
again
the
court
held
that
the
failure
of
federal
regulations
to
cover
a
particular
subject
matter
did
not
mean
that
that
subject
matter
was
not
within
the
preempted
field.
coming
to
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
here
today,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
once
again
return
to
the
question
of
airspace
management
which
i
think
is
central
to
this
appeal.
it’s
common
ground
at
least
between
the
appellees
and
the
united
states
that
airspace
management
is
exclusively
a
federal
responsibility.
we
say
that
any
entity
which
controls
the
hours
that
aircraft
can
enter
the
navigable
airspace
is
inevitably
involved
in
airspace
management.
as
we
have
seen,
curfews
have
dramatically
have
adverse
effect
on
the
congestion
problem
on
scheduling
and
on
maintenance
on
the
system
as
a
whole,
and
we
urge
that
restrictions
which
has
a
severe
and
adverse
effects
on
transportation,
air
transportation
particularly,
should
come
from
a
centralized
agency
which
have
been
entrusted
by
congress
with
all
aspects
of
airspace
management
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
aviation
act
of
1958
is
the
corner
stone
of
the
statutory
scheme
here
involved,
and
i
think
we’ve
come
to
the
point
in
the
argument
where
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
stop
for
a
minute
and
consider
the
high
points
of
that
act,
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
act.
enacting
the
1958
act,
congress
responded
to
two
fundamental
and
closely
related
defects
in
the
prior
statutory
history.
first,
as
the
senate
committee
said
about
the
1958
act,
there
had
previously
been
a
diffusion
among
many
committees
and
boards.
second,
as
the
senate
committee
said,
there
was
a
lack
of
any
clear
authority
in
the
statute
for
centralized
airspace
management.
by
1958,
it’d
become
crucially
necessary
for
congress
to
do
something
about
this
situation.
there’d
been
a
vast
increase
in
air
traffic
and,
even
by
that
early
date,
congress
recognized
that
the
nation’s
airspace
was
a
diminishing
and
vital
natural
resource.
now,
to
correct
this
splintering
of
authority,
congress
vested
the
1958
act
on
questionable
authority
for
all
aspects
of
airspace
management
in
the
faa.
indeed,
congress
went
so
far
investing
this
plenary
authority
to
say
explicitly
the
administrator
of
the
faa
should
not
be
required
to
submit
his
decisions
regarding
airspace
to
any
other
organization.
in
addition
in
this
1958
act,
congress,
and
it’s
important
to
recognize
this,
authorized
the
administrator
to
issue
regulations
for
the
efficient
utilization
of
airspace,
as
well
as
for
the
safety
of
aircraft.
this
dual
purpose
runs
all
through
the
statute,
all
through
the
actions
of
the
administrator
the
purpose
of
achieving
safety
and
the
purpose
of
achieving
safety
and
the
purpose
of
having
an
efficient
use
of
a
navigable
airspace.
now,
in
the
1958
act,
congress
also
gave
the
faa
authority
to
issue
regulations
for
the
protection
of
persons
and
property
on
the
ground.
the
amicus
brief
for
the
united
states
vastly
understates
the
importance
of
this
provision
asserting
that
the
provision
was
only
designed
to
provide
protection
from
insecticides
sprayed
during
crop
dusting
and
saying
that
it
was
wholly
unrelated
to
congressional
consideration
of
the
aircraft
noise
problem.
this
is
a
demonstratively
faulty
reading
of
the
legislative
history
and,
unfortunately,
this
faulty
premise
infects
the
entire
government’s
argument.
the
government
has
failed,
in
its
characterization
of
this
section,
to
note
the
statements
in
the
1962
hearings
by
congressman
oren
harris,
the
long-time
chairman
of
the
commerce
committee
and
an
architect
of
the
1958
act
who
explicitly
said
that
that
provision
of
the
1958
act
was
addressed
to
the
problem
of
aircraft
noise.
he
said
that
the
problem
of
crop
dusting
was
not
to
so
reason
for
congress’
enactment
of
that
particular
section
but,
rather,
the
section
was
in
order
to
give
broad
rule
making
authority
to
the
faa
in
the
field
of
aircraft
noise.
the
government
is
also
wrong
as
a
matter
of
history
in
saying
that
the
authority
conferred
by
this
section
of
the
1958
act
was
used
only
at
a
few
noise
sensitive
airports.
the
fact
is,
as
cav
chairman
boyd
testified
noise
abatement
runway
patterns
were
established
under
this
section
at
every
major
airport
in
the
united
states
as
early
as
1962.
by
this
1958
act,
which
is
i
say
the
corner
stone
and
it
has
to
be
our
beginning
point
here,
congress
vested
in
the
faa
plenary
authority
for
airspace
management
and
the
regulation
of
aircraft
operations.
under
this
statutory
authority
of
the
administrator
of
the
faa
has
issued
regulations
which
have
been
described
as
being
a
formidable
proportions,
impressive
detail,
and
manifest
sophistication.
now,
to
understand
the
scope
of
the
breath
of
the
federal
control,
i’d
like
to
ask
you
to
consider
with
me,
as
one
of
the
witnesses
did
at
the
trial,
the
impact
of
federal
regulation
on
a
typical
flight
from
hollywood
burbank
airport
to
san
francisco.
in
the
example
i’m
using
here,
i’ve
chosen
a
flight
from
hollywood
burbank
to
san
francisco
because
that’s
the
most
frequent
destination,
but
the
scope
of
control
would
be
the
same
if
the
flight
had
gone
to
phoenix
or
on
the
burbank-seattle
route
or
any
other
commercial
flight.
perhaps
i
should
begin
the
description
of
this
imaginary
flight
by
saying
that
each
commercial
aircraft
on
this
route
has
an
airworthiness
certificate
and
it
has
a
type
certificate
not--
covering
not
only
the
airframe
and
the
engines,
but
every
appliance
on
the
aircraft,
and
each
aircraft
is
flow
in
accordance
with
operation
specifications
which
authorize
its
operation
into
and
out
of
each
airport
that
it
serves.
furthermore,
each
pilot
must
have
a
pilot
certificate
and
each
flight
engineer
must
be
certificated
by
the
faa.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
fundamental
difference
between
that
case
and
this,
your
honor,
is
that
in
that
case
the
federal
regulation
was
directed
solely
at
safety
on
the
seas
and
the
waterways.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
faa,
under
both
the
1958
act
and
the
1968
act,
is
explicitly
required
to
balance
not
only
those
interests,
environmental
interests
as
well.
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
faa
has
to
take
into
account
the
multiple
national
interest
involved:
national
defense,
aviation,
and
environmental
considerations,
and
that
is
a
fundamental
and
basic
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
huron
case.
if
i
can
continue
on
the
imaginary
flight
to
san
francisco,
i
think
it’s
important
to
know
that
long
before
this
flight
takes
place,
perhaps
so
much
as
30
days,
a
flight
plan
would’ve
been
filed
with
the
faa
or
traffic
control
center
for
southern
california,
the
center
that’s
responsible
for
managing
all
the
airspace
of
southern
california
which
stores
these
flight
plans
in
a
computer.
30
minutes
before
the
flight
takes
place,
the
faa
center
electronically
informs
the
faa
tower
at
hollywood
burbank
airport
of
the
anticipated
flight
so
the
tower
can
be
ready
to
give
the
necessary
clearances
to
the
pilot,
whether
the
pilot
gets
his
clearance
will
depend
upon
conditions
of
the
navigable
airspace.
these
conditions
are
frequently
abnormal
or
subnormal
depending
on
matters
such
as
weather,
congestion,
terminal
repairs,
and
accidents
or
a
combination
of
those
factors,
and
when
this
happens,
the
faa
control
center
for
southern
california
may
tell
the
faa
tower
at
hollywood
burbank
to
hold
that
aircraft
on
the
ground
or
to
modify
the
departure
in
some
respect.
now,
if
the
tower
at
burbank
is
not
directed
by
the
faa
center
to
hold
the
aircraft
on
the
ground
or
to
give
them
some
other
direction,
then
the
clearance
will
go
from
the
tower
to
the
pilot,
but
it’s
important
at
this
point
to
note
that
when
the
aircraft
is
loaded,
when
the
door
is
shut,
the
pilot
cannot
begin
to
taxi
on
the
runways
of
that
airport
until
the
faa
tower
clears
him
to
taxi,
clears
him
to
the
runway
which
is
assigned
for
that
flight.
the
runway
which
is
assigned
will
be
the
result
of
a
number
of
factors
including
federal
noise
abatement
procedures.
after
taxing
to
the
designated
runway,
the
pilot
must
get
a
further
clearance
for
takeoff
from
the
faa
tower.
i
think
it’s
important
for
our
purposes
to
notice
that
before
a
plane
can
take
off
into
the
navigable
airspace,
it
has
to
be
cleared
by
the
faa
tower.
the
faa
tower
acts
as
a
control
valve
regulating
access
to
the
navigable
airspace.
after
takeoff,
the
airplane
is
monitored,
directed,
supervised
very
closely
by
the
hollywood
burbank
tower
as
long
as
it’s
within
the
tower’s
airspace
and
it’s
transferred
to
the
center
for
southern
california.
about
halfway
to
san
francisco,
it’s
passed
off
to
the
oakland
center
which,
indeed,
then
monitors
it
with
great
care
and
precision,
until
it’s
in
the
vicinity
of
the
san
francisco
airport
and
then
the
faa
tower
at
san
francisco
guides
it
down
into
landing
and,
once
again,
into
the
taxiing
process.
it’s
by
no
means
a
high
privilege
to
say
that
every
aspect
of
this
flight,
from
the
planning
for
it
as
much
as
30
days
ahead,
the
entry
into
navigable
airspace
and
everyday
detail
of
the
execution
of
the
flight
is
supervised
by
the
federal
airspace
manager,
the
faa.
now,
it’s
our
basic
position
which
i’ll
be
reiterating
here.
if
there
are
to
be
restrictions
imposed
on
the
entry
into
the
navigable
airspace,
they
should
come
from
the
federal
agency
which
has
been
authorized
by
the
congress
to
weight
the
national
interest
involved
and
determine
whether
or
not
those
restrictions
should
be
imposed.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
justice,
that
raises
the
question
which
is
not
here
as
to
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
power
of
an
airport
proprietor.
that
power,
being
based
upon
ancient
property
concepts,
would
no
doubt
depend
somewhat
on
the
law
of
each
state.
but,
beyond
that,
i
would
want
to
say
that
although
the
question
is
not
here,
there
would
be
important
barriers
at
several
levels
to
that
action.
first,
there
might
be
constitutional
barriers.
such
a
curfew
might
well
involve
an
abridgment
of
rights
under
the
commerce
clause.
second,
such
a
proposal
might
well
be
in
conflict
with
federal
law
in
some
respect.
and,
finally,
i
think
that
it’s
worthwhile
saying
that
there
may
be
contractual
provisions
that
would
prevent
the
establishment
of
such
a
curfew
by
the
proprietor.
that
question
is
not
here.
unquestionably,
the
proprietor
has
been
saved
from
the
full
scope
of
the
preemption
under
the
1968
act
of
what
the
scope
of
the
proprietor’s
rights
are
as
not
yet
determined.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
the
private
airport
would
be
in
substantially
the
same
situation
as
other
public
airports,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
they
had
established
service
and
if
the
ending
of
that
service
would
involve
a
violation
of
commerce
clause,
i
can
see
the
possibility
of
insistence
on
the
continuation
of
that
service.
there’s
no
question,
but
once
a
private
airport
undertakes
to
begin
to
serve
the
public,
it
has
obligations
it
may
continue.
that
would
be
particularly
true
if
that
private
airport
had
received
federal
funds
for
control
tower
and
other
navigational
equipment,
but
not
for
its
runways.
as
i
move
forward
in
this
preemption
argument,
i
think
it’s
very
significant
to
me
that
the
united
states
concedes
in
its
brief
that
airspace
management
is
an
exclusively
federal
responsibility.
in
our
view,
and
we
believe
in
the
view
of
congress,
airspace
management
is
a
comprehensive
and
invisible
concept
which
includes
all
regulation
of
the
use
of
navigable
airspace.
any
entity
we
say
which
regulates
the
hours
that
air
traffic
may
flow
into
the
navigable
airspace
is
inevitably
involved
in
airspace
management.
to
allow
local
entities
to
regulate
this
flow
would,
we
say,
fractionalize
airspace
management
and
direct
our
position
to
the
congressional
purpose.
a
curfew
acts
as
a
blockade
on
traffic
in
a
manner
which
we
think
is
sharply
inconsistent
with
the
efficient
operation
of
the
system.
we
all
know
that
the
congestion
with
its
attendant
threats
to
safety
and
efficiency
is
one
of
the
principle
problems
of
our
transportation
system,
yet
curfew
not
only
increase
congestion
but
they
aggravate
it
in
the
hours
on
the
shoulders
of
the
curfews
where
the
congestion
is
already
the
worst.
those
are
particularly
the
hours
between
6
and
10
in
the
evening.
the
adverse
effects
of
a
curfew
are
greatly
aggravated,
greatly
multiplied
in
a
country
as
broad
as
ours
where
the
impact
is
spread
over
six
time
zones
unless
magnified
because
of
the
effect
of
the
time
zones
on
scheduling.
once
again,
to
come
back
to
the
central
point,
restrictions
so
severe
and
debilitating
to
the
system
as
a
curfew
and,
as
we
believe
a
curfew
to
be,
should
be
imposed,
if
at
all,
only
by
the
agency
entrusted
by
congress
with
overall
airspace
management.
now,
i’ve
been
at
some
pain
as
to
discuss
the
1958
act--
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
federal
government
acting
through
the
federal
aviation
agency
and
the
manager,
being
the
manager
of
national
airport,
has
established
a
curfew
at
national
airport.
now
at
that
national
airport,
the
curfew
is
established
by
the
proprietor
of
that
airport
by
the
federal
government
in
its
role
as
airspace
manager.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
the
federal
aviation
agency
has
not
established
curfews
at
any
of
the
airports
around
the
country.
indeed,
the
faa
has
chosen
another
strategy.
they
have
chosen
the
strategy
of
runway
use
patterns
to
minimize
the
noise.
they’ve
chosen
the
strategy
of
special
techniques
for
landing
and
takeoffs.
they’ve
chosen
the
strategy
of
special
departure
patterns,
but
they
have
not
adopted
or
imposed
a
curfew
in
any
place
in
the
country,
and
i
think--
mr.
warren
christopher
i
certainly
don’t
agree
that
they
haven’t
done
anything
about
noise
abatement.
i
think
they
have
done
all
that
they
could
do
within
the
state
of
the
art.
i’ve
dwelled--
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
your
honor,
i
could
not
agree
that
they’ve
done
nothing
there.
they’ve
established
a
runway
use
program
and
the
planes
now
takeoff
on
the
least
sensitive
of
the
runways,
and
they’re
required
to
do
so.
the
local
airport
faa
tower
chief
has
established
this
runway
use
procedure
which,
in
his
judgment,
is
the
best
way
to
minimize
the
noise
at
night.
now,
i’ve
dwelled
on
the
scope
of
the
1958
act
because
i
think
it’s
a
crucial
backdrop
for
the
1968
amendment
by
congress.
in
1968,
congress
adopted
an
amendment
which
explicitly
provided
that
the
administrator
of
the
faa
shall
prescribe
regulations
for
the
control
and
abatement
of
aircraft
noise.
in
the
hearings
on
that
bill,
the
secretary
of
transportation
was
asked
about
the
status
of
local
and
state
governments
under
the
amendment.
he
asked
time
to
submit
a
letter.
he
submitted
a
letter.
the
letter
was
adopted
by
the
senate
committee
and
it’s
become
a
focal
point
in
this
litigation.
now
this
letter,
as
justices
already
pointed
out,
makes
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
police
powers
of
local
and
state
governments
and
the
proprietary
power
of
an
airport
operator.
as
to
police
powers,
the
letter
says
state
and
local
governments
will
remain
unable
to
use
their
police
powers
to
control
aircraft
noise.
in
contrast,
the
letter
says
airport
owners
operating
as
proprietors
will
retain
rights
to
take
certain
actions
with
respect
to
noise.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes.
your
honor,
it’s
printed
at
the
back
of
the--
mr.
warren
christopher
no,
it’s
printed
at
the
back
of
the
burbank
brief,
your
honor,
the
appellants’
brief.
mr.
warren
christopher
we’re
at
least
partly
responsible
for
that,
your
honor.
this
is
the--
mr.
warren
christopher
the
back
of
the
grey
brief
of
the
appellants’--
their
main
brief,
and
it’s
in
the
first
appendix.
the
sentences
i’m
referring
to,
your
honor,
are
on
page
1
which
is
an
unnumbered
page.
mr.
warren
christopher
but,
down
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
you
see
the
sentences,
hr3400
would
merely
expand
the
government’s
role
in
a
field
already
preempted.
it
would
not
change
this
preemption.
state
and
local
governments
will
remain
unable
to
use
their
police
powers
to
control
aircraft
noise
by
regulating
the
flight
of
aircraft.
mr.
warren
christopher
and,
however,
the
proposed
legislation
will
not
affect
the
rights
of
a
state
and
local
public
agency
as
a
proprietor
of
an
airport,
and
so
on.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
the
senate
committee
which
he
submitted
after
he’d
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
submit
a
letter,
and
this
was
adopted
by
the
senate
committee
which
issued
the
authoritative
report
on
this
legislation,
adopted
by
this
senate
committee
as
its
statement
of
the
rights
of
local
and
state
government.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
sir.
he
was
over
there
testifying.
mr.
warren
christopher
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
christopher
as
its
statement
of
the
respective
rights
of
the
local
and
state
governments.
you
see,
your
honor,
it--
the
beginning
of
the
appendix
section
which
we
have
been
reading
together,
the
senate
committee
said
“in
this
regard,
we
concur
in
the
following
views
set
forth
by
the
secretary
in
his
letter
to
the
committee.”
continuing
then,
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
same
distinction
is
made
in
the
unpublished
letter
from
the
department
of
transportation
to
congressman
fidel
which
the
united
states
has
printed
as
an
appendix
to
its
amicus
brief.
that’s
the
grey
brief.
now,
at
page
67
of
that
grey
brief,
i
think
it’s
quite
significant
to
look
at
the
sentence
in
the
middle
of
the
page
where,
once
again,
the
department
of
transportation
was
telling
congress,
this
time
the
other
house
of
congress,
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
ata
concedes
in
its
testimony
that
only
regulatory
authority
left
to
local
communities
or
airport
operators
is
the
authority
of
the
airport
operator
in
the
exercise
of
its
proprietary
function
to
limit
on
noise
grounds
the
kind
of
aircraft
which
may
use
its
facility.
it’s
hard
for
me
to
imagine
a
clearer
statement
of
the
distinction
between
proprietary
power
and
police
power
that
it’s
embodied,
first,
in
the
letter
of
the
secretary
to
the
senate
committee,
and
then
in
this
more
recently
available
letter
from
dot
to
congressman
fidel.
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i’m
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
address
that
question.
i’ve
noted
it
when
you
asked
it
of
others.
although
this
is
one
of
the
few
privately
owned
airports
in
the
country,
nevertheless,
the
distinction
will
be
very
important
to
many
publicly
owned
airports
for
although
many
cities
own
and
operate
airports,
they
very
frequently
own
and
operate
them
in
areas
outside
of
their
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
warren
christopher
that’s
right,
and
we’ve
shown
in
our
brief
at
page
35
and
36
the
very
many
examples
there
are
of
airports
which
are
operated
by
cities
or
by
counties
but
which
exists,
at
least
all
or
in
part,
in
other
jurisdictions:
san
francisco,
baltimore,
cincinnati,
atlanta.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
question
is
here,
mr.
justice.
in
response
to
the
government’s
argument,
it
will
be
so
bizarre
to
have
the
preemption
be
this
narrow.
preemption
is
very
important,
not
just
to
burbank
but
to
any
city
airport
which
is
operated
in
an
area
not
wholly
within
its
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
warren
christopher
others
might,
mr.
justice,
but
this
own
certainly
would
and
i
think
that’s
a
fundamental
position
that
we’ll
be
taking
throughout
the
case.
now,
the
distinction
we’re
talking
about
here
is
not
at
all
an
irrational
one.
indeed,
the
distinction
is
rooted
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
griggs
versus
allegheny
county.
as
we
all
know,
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
the
airport
proprietor
has
to
pay
the
bill
if
flights
are
held
to
have
constituted
taking
from
this
land
owner--
the
land
owner’s
property.
because
the
airport
proprietor
must
bear
the
liability,
congress
created
this
narrow
exemption
from
federal
preemption
so
that
the
proprietor
could
protect
himself.
it
reserved
these
rights
to
the
proprietor,
but
it
did
not
reserve
them
to
cities
because
the
reason
for
the
distinction,
the
reason
for
the
narrow
exemption
from
preemption
did
not
exist
for
the
cities.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes.
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
scope
of
the
proprietor’s
rights
depends
upon
state
law,
and
you’d
have
to
examine
very
carefully
whether
or
not
there
might
be
some
conflict
with
existing
federal
regulation.
you’d
have
to
also
examine
whether
or
not
the
enactment
of
such
a
curfew
or
the
imposition
of
it
by
an
airport
operator
would
rather
follow
the
commerce
clause
or
of
contractual--
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that’s
more
true
of
preemption
than
it
is
of
conflict.
if
there
is
an
explicit
faa
order
saying
that
the
airport
shall
remain
open
at
night,
it
might
find
that
that
would
run
a
foul
of
what
the
proprietor
did
here.
i
would
say
that,
while
preemption
and
the
full
rigors
of
preemption
may
not
be
visited
on
the
airport
proprietor,
the
conflict
doctrine
remains.
the
federal
law
would
be
supreme
if
the
federal
government
imposed
a
restriction
which
is
absolutely
contrary
to
what
the
proprietor
has
done.
mr.
warren
christopher
there
is
no
such
restriction.
mr.
warren
christopher
that
certainly
is
our
position,
your
honor.
i
simply
did
not
want
to
mislead
the
court
because
i
think
that
question
will
come
up
with
the
record
that
indicates--
will
indicate
there
may
be
problems
under
the
constitution
of
a
different
character
or
problems
under
the
contracts
of
a
different
character.
i
think
that
question
is
not
here
and
it
may
be
quite
a
difficult
question
when
it
comes.
mr.
warren
christopher
not
at
all.
i
think
it’s
a
very
important
reservation
of
power
that
airport
proprietors
will
be
exercising
and
have
indeed
exercised
in
the
past,
as
the
port
of
new
york
authority’s
brief
indicates.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
all
the
things
that
were
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
they
created
the
distinction,
but
certainly
that
one
thing
was
in
the
mind
of
congress,
as
you
can
see
from
the
committee
reports
and
the
letter
to
the
committee
by
dot.
now,
the
briefs
of
our
adversaries
have
a
difficult
time
with
this
legislative
history.
the
brief
reflecting
the
views
the
department
of
transportation
advised
to
discount
on
the
ground
that
congress
did
not
focus
on
the
distinction,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
strange
position
for
an
agency
which
advanced
the
distinction
and
persuaded
congress
to
accept
it
to
be
taking.
united
states
also
argues
that
it
would
be
bizarre
to
have
the
federal
preemption
apply
only
to
a
few
private
airports,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
federal
preemption
operates
with
respect
to
all
airports,
both
public
and
private,
and
it
prevents
the
exercise
of
local
police
power
to
control
aircraft
operations
at
those
airports
whether
they’re
publicly
owned
or
privately
owned.
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
situation
very
frequently
exists
that
an
airport
owner
must
face
the
fact
that
he
is
in
the
jurisdiction
of
more
than
one
entity
and
he
may
be
in
a
jurisdiction
of
quite
a
different
entity
then
his
public
body,
the
public
body
of
which
he
is
a
member,
and
this
situation
exists
all
over
the
country.
with
respect
to
the
hollywood
burbank
airport,
to
pick
up
on
a
question
from
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
even
that
airport
is
subject
to
two
jurisdictions:
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
the
city
of
burbank,
and
they
might
well
enact
conflicting
or
inconsistent
regulations
which
would
have
a
very
great
potential
for
interference
with
the
national
air
transportation
system.
as
my
time
is
going
here,
i’d
like
to
move
next
to
the
conflict
issue
which
i
think
is
very
significant
in
this
case.
it
was
an
issue
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
itself
unanimous.
now,
the
conflict
arises
here
because,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
burbank
ordinance,
the
faa
had
focused
on
the
subject
of
nighttime
takeoffs
and
issued
a
noise
abatement
order.
by
this
order,
they
established
a
certain
runway
as
the
noise
abatement
runway
which
was
to
be
used
between
11
p.m.
and
7
a.m.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
order
represented
a
considered
determination
by
the
faa
that
the
burbank
order
is
below
the
lowest
practical
minimum.
the
tower
chief
had
announced
that
the
noise
abatement
procedures
contained
in
this
order
were
designed
to
reduce
noise
exposure
to
the
lowest
practical
minimum
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
followed
that
up
by
saying
that
the
order
represented
a
considered
determination
that
the
burbank
order
was
beneath
the
lowest
practical
minimum
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
because
this
was
so,
the
burbank
order
interfered
with
the
balance
set
by
the
faa
in
accordance
with
the
power
vested
in
it
by
congress.
now,
the
united
states
attempts
to
attack
this
conflict
holding
by
saying
that
the
faa
order
simply
did
not
represent
any
consideration
of
a
locally
administered
curfew.
the
government
doesn’t
offer
any
citation
of
authority
for
this
simply
did
not
consider
statement
and
there
is
none.
on
the
contrary,
the
district
judge
who
heard
the
testimony
of
the
tower
chief
and
the
other
witnesses
found
that,
in
issuing
the
order,
the
faa
had
taken
in
hand
the
subject
of
nighttime
takeoffs.
we
don’t
need
to
guess
about
the
views
of
the
faa
with
respect
to
this
order,
and
their
amicus
briefs
in
the
lower
court,
the
faa
cited,
appended,
and
relied
on
this
order
which
the
court
of
appeals
then
found
to
be
in
conflict.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
the
faa
order
was
substantially
before
the
enactment
of
the
ordinance.
now,
in
trying
to
avoid
this
conflict
which
the
court
of
appeals
found,
the
brief
for
the
united
states
asserts
the
opposition
to
a
curfew
at
burbank
by
the
faa
would’ve
constituted
a
major
change
in
policy.
we
say,
not
at
all.
at
appendix
2
of
our
brief,
this
blue
supplemental
brief,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
examples.
in
recent
years
which
the
faa
has
gone
on
record
as
being
opposed
to
curfews
at
various
airports
around
the
country
in
southern
california,
in
texas,
and
new
york
state.
one
of
the
most
significant
examples
occurred
right
in
los
angeles
where,
in
1960,
the
faa
explicitly
considered
a
nighttime
restriction
and
decided
against
it
because
of
the
serious
problems
that
it
posed
for
the
national
air
transportation
system.
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i
know
of
none.
the
only
curfew
imposed
by
the
faa
of
which
i
know
is
the
one
at
washington
national.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
that’s
a
voluntary
agreement,
but
the
most
significant
aspect
of
it,
to
me,
is
imposed
by
the
airport
proprietor
and
it’s
imposed
by
the
national
airspace
manager
of
the
federal
aviation
agency.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
by
all
means,
your
honor.
you
know,
there
are
only--
there
are
over
10,000
landing
fields
in
the
united
states.
there
are
over
346
of
those
landing
fields
that
have
faa
towers
and
there’re
about
140
airports
which
are--
air
carrier
airports
which
serve
more
than
100,000
people
a
year.
now,
i
certainly
would
not
contend
that
each
of
these
10,000
airports
need
to
be
operated
all
night.
i
would--
mr.
warren
christopher
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
many
of
them
do
not
have
lights.
mr.
warren
christopher
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
is
a
question
of
power,
not
a
question
of
whether
there
should
be
curfews
but
who
has
power
to
impose
them.
now,
our
basic
argument
is
that
if
curfews
are
to
be
imposed,
they
represent
such
a
severe
and
debilitating
affect
on
the
national
air
transportation
system
that
they
should
be
imposed
only
by
a
centralized
agency.
now,
the
city
of
burbank
attacks
the
conflict
on
one
other
ground
i
need
to
note.
burbank
claims
that
the
procedures
set
forth
in
this
faa
order
are
non-mandatory.
the
record,
however,
is
to
the
contrary.
the
record
shows
the
procedures
became
mandatory
through
incorporation
into
the
aircraft’s
clearance.
thus,
the
district
judge
explicitly
found
that
the
preferential
runway
assignment
is
incorporated
to
the
aircraft’s
clearance
as
an
instruction
to
the
pilot.
if
the
pilot
violates
this
instruction,
he
becomes
subject
to
a
civil
penalty
and
he
may
become
subject
to
revocation
of
his
license.
testimony
in
trial
court
showed
that
this
runway
procedure
which
was
embodied
in
the
faa
order
was
followed
except
on
a
few
occasions
when
the
tower
itself
permitted
a
deviation
because
of
weather
or
other
operating
conditions
affecting
safety.
so
the
net
of
the
matter,
as
we
see
it,
is
the
faa
order
is
a
considered
determination
regarding
nighttime
takeoffs
by
the
agency
empowered
to
do
so
and,
therefore,
is
in
conflict
with
the
burbank
ordinance.
the
remaining
time,
i
at
least,
as
far
as
my
portion
of
the
argument
go,
i’d
like
to
discuss
the
commerce
issues
which
seem
to
me
to
have
been
perhaps
not
adequately
attended
to
up
to
this
point,
certainly
not
by
me.
the
commerce
clause
has
two
separate
and
independent
aspects,
and
i
think
they
both
deserve
a
great
deal
of
consideration.
the
first
aspect
relates
to
the
holding
of
the
district
court.
the
burbank
ordinance
operates
in
an
area
where
regulation
must
be
prescribed
by
a
single
authority
and,
therefore,
the
commerce
clause
standing
alone
invalidates
the
ordinance
under
the
rule
laid
down
in
southern
pacific
versus
arizona.
the
test
under
this
phase
of
the
commerce
clause
is
not
whether
regulations
at
each
airport
must
be
precisely
the
same.
we
recognize,
as
i
was
saying
a
minute
ago,
that
different
airports
would
require
different
treatment.
the
test
is
whether
regulation
should
come,
in
this
instance,
from
a
single
authority,
and
we
say
that
it
must
because
of
the
volume
of
air
commerce,
the
speed
in
which
it’s
conducted,
and
the
technical
complexity
of
airline
scheduling
and
aircraft
maintenance.
only
through
the
uniform
application
of
a
national
policy,
through
centralized
control
by
a
federal
agency
can
we
properly
cope
with
issue
in
the
form
of
transportation.
mr.
warren
christopher
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
christopher
basic
interrelationship,
and
we
say
that
that
is
a
reason
independent
of
burden--
independent
of
a
burden
analysis
for
holding
here
that
the
commerce
clause
requires
that
these
restrictions
be
imposed,
if
at
all,
by
a
centralized
authority.
now,
the
national
character
of
the
system
which
justice
stewart
was
just
referring
to
is
demonstrated
very
clearly
by
the
faa’s
flow
control
system.
flow
control
involves
the
metering
of
aircrafts
so
as
to
cope
with
congestion
or
weather
or
other
impediments
to
interstate
commerce.
now,
this
flow
control,
as
i
illustrated
in
my
imaginary
trip,
may
involve
holding
aircraft
on
the
ground
at
various
airports.
it
may
involve
establishing
a
special
separation
between
them
in
a
navigable
airspace.
the
flow
control
was
initiated
by
the
faa
in
1969
and,
at
that
time,
they
made
it
the
responsibility
of
the
faa
center
in
each
one
of
the
regions
of
the
country.
however,
only
a
few
months
after
flow
control
was
put
in
by
the
faa,
the
faa
found
it
essential
to
establish
a
centralized
flow
control
center
in
washington
d.c.
to
provide
coordination
of
these
flow
control
decisions.
the
faa
found
that
none
of
the
regional
centers
had
enough
information
to
make
wise
decisions
for
the
system
as
a
whole,
and
i
would
say
and
emphasize
that
if
national
coordination
is
necessary
for
the
flow
control,
it
is
vastly
more
necessary
for
such
a
lasting
restriction
of
airports
as
would
be
a
night
curfew.
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
in
1971
the
department
of
transportation
took
almost
precisely
the
same
position
with
respect
to
the
commerce
issue,
as
i’ve
been
asserting
here.
this
position
was
taken
on
a
brief
filed
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
and,
with
your
permission,
i’ll
read
just
one
or
two
sentences
from
it.
air
transportation
said
to
dot,
perhaps
more
than
any
other
form
of
commerce
requires
regulation
by
a
single
authority.
even
before
600-mile
per
hour
flights
became
the
custom,
congress
recognized
this
need
by
the
establishment
of
the
federal
aviation
agency.
and
to
continue
this
sentence
from
the
dot’s
brief,
it
would
indeed
be
a
harmful
and
regressive
step
to
admit
a
compromise
of
the
faa’s
authority
to
permitting
the
enforcement
of
local
laws
or
regulations
regarding
the
use
of
navigable
airspace.
this
brief
filed
by
the
dot
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
is
quoted
in
full
in
the
answering
brief
of
the
port
of
new
york
authority.
now,
i
certainly
don’t
challenge
the
right
of
the
government
to
change
its
position
in
this
matter.
i
have
no
criticism
of
it,
but
i
hope
it
won’t
be
improper
for
me
to
say
it
seems
to
me
they
were
right
the
first
time.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
an
advisory
opinion
of
the
justices
with
respect
to
a
legislation
banning
a
certain
supersonic
aircraft
from
massachusetts.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
court--
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
net
of
this
first
argument
under
the
commerce
clause
is
our
view
that
independent
of
other
aspects
of
the
discussion
today,
independent
of
preemption,
independent
of
conflict,
independent
of
the
burden
aspect
of
the
commerce
clause
that,
under
southern
pacific
versus
arizona,
the
court
should
find
that
air
commerce,
because
of
its
speed
and
complexity,
requires
centralized
management.
the
other
aspect
of
the
commerce
argument
involves
the
holding
of
the
district
court
that
local
ordinances
would
constitute
and
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
this
is
the
burden
issue.
the
decisions
of
this
court
teach
us
that
an
ordinance
such
as
burbanks
cannot
be
considered
as
an
isolated
phenomenon,
but
must
be
weighed
and
tested
as
if
imposed
on
a
national
basis.
this
rule
has
been
uniformly
applied,
i
believe,
in
decisions
of
this
court
and
it’s
especially
appropriate,
as
this
court
has
said,
where
the
restriction
might
interfere
with
the
efficient
use
of
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce.
for
instance,
in
the
southern
pacific
case,
the
court
said
that
it
had
to
consider
the
consequences
if
all
50
states
had
sought
to
regulate
train
lines.
similarly,
in
hood
&
sons
versus
du
mond,
this
court
considered
the
effect
on
commerce
if
other
states
were
to
have
adopted
regulations
comparable
to
those
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
milk
industry.
in
this
particular
case,
the
importance
of
considering
local
curfews
on
a
national
basis
is
emphasized
by
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that,
if
upheld
here,
curfews
will
proliferate
and
be
adopted
by
virtually
all
cities
surrounding
airports.
it’s
a
very,
very
contagious
business.
several
witnesses
have
testified
to
this
contagious
character
of
the
curfews
and
there
seems
little
doubt
that
many
cities,
as
reported
in
the
press,
are
watching
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
and
will
enact
curfews
if
they
are
upheld
here.
now,
the
government
takes
a
rather
unusual
position
that
the
nationwide
effects
of
a
restriction
on
commerce
might
be
appropriate
in
some
cases,
but
is
not
appropriate
here.
i
think
this
an
assertion
on
their
part
that
some
support
it
and
i
find
no
support
for
it
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
moreover,
the
government
even
reveals
some
doubt
about
its
own
theory
when
it
says
in
a
footnote
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
consider
a
curfew
in
relation
to
existing
curfews
when
weighing
it
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
you’ll
soon
see
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
theory
which
produced
very
extraordinary
results.
presumably,
the
footnote
means
that,
at
some
point,
a
proliferation
of
curfews
could
result
in
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
does
that
mean
if
there
are10
curfews
creating
a
violation
of
all
10
are
invalid,
or
does
it
mean
the
10th
one
is
invalid
and
the
first
ones
are
valid,
thus,
creating
a
race
to
the
city
council
to
see
who
can
get
there
first
or
does
it
mean,
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
10th
one
makes
the
1st
one
invalid
but
the
10th
one
continues
to
be
valid
itself.
well,
i
think
you
can
see
that
the
irrationality
of
the
results
from
such
a
test
confirms
the
wisdom
of
this
court’s
longstanding
rule
that
restrictions
on
commerce
should
be
judged
as
if
applied
nationally.
evaluated
on
a
national
basis--
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
the
bibb
case
is
very
much
in
point.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
your
honor.
restrictions
on
commerce,
especially
those
which
interfere
with
the
national
system,
must
be
weighed
and
tested
as
if
imposed
on
a
national
basis.
evaluated
on
a
national
basis,
the
record
seems,
to
me,
to
demonstrate
overwhelmingly
that
night
curfews
would
cause
massive
disruptions
in
commerce.
curfew
on
jet
takeoffs
alone
without
a
curfew
on
landing,
simply
a
curfew
on
takeoffs
alone
like
the
burbank
curfew
would
require
cancellation
of
more
than
1,000
flights
every
single
night.
because
over
48%
of
the
airmail
moves
at
night,
a
curfew
would
delay
not
millions
but
billions
of
pieces
of
mail
at
least
one
day,
a
delay
which
is
certainly
in
sure
of
conflict
with
our
postal
policy
which
says
overnight
transportation
of
letter
mail
is
the
primary
goal
of
postal
operations.
the
effect
of
a
night
curfew
on
air
cargo
service
would
be
equally
drastic.
42%
of
air
cargo
moves
at
night
and,
indeed
the
whole
industry
exists
depending
upon
its
ability
to
move
cargo
on
an
overnight
basis
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
the
other,
and
i
think
we
can
see
that
the
imposition
of
curfews
on
a
nationwide
basis
would
have
a
severe
hobbling
effect
if
it
wouldn’t
completely
destroy
this
growing
air
cargo
industry.
continental
airlines,
one
of
the
carriers
serving
hollywood
burbank
airport,
made
a
thorough
study
of
the
financial
effect
of
the
imposition
of
a
burbank
curfew
on
its
entire
system.
continental
airlines
found
its
operating
cost
would
be
increased
by
more
than
25%
if
there
were
a
curfew
throughout
its
system.
it
would
be
required
alone
to
cancel
48
flights
a
night
and
it
would
have
to
purchase
six
new
jet
aircrafts
to
replace
the
cancelled
services.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
justice,
continental
just
commenced
its
service
at
hollywood
burbank
when
this
case
was
tried.
it
was
affected
in
the
sense
that
its
witnesses
or
its
witness
testified
that
it
was
inhibited
from
filling
out
its
service
pattern
on
a
flight
from
seattle
back
to
burbank
or
would
have
been
if
the
curfew
was
in
effect,
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
was
too
early
in
continentalm
airline
service
at
hollywood
burbank
for
it
to
have
really
felt
the
effect
of
the
curfew
on
it.
now,
i’d
like
to
briefly
recur
to
one
or
two
of
the
points
made
earlier
in
the
argument.
with
respect
to
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
act
is
not
at
all
consistent
with
the
result
below.
that
act
requires
federal
agencies
to
consider
environmental
matters
in
their
decision
making
process,
but
it
also
explicitly
provides
congress
shall
not
exclude
other
essential
considerations
of
national
policy
in
determining
what
policy
shall
be
imposed
finally
by
the
federal
agency.
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
in
a
sense,
duplicates
the
1968
amendment
with
respect
to
aircraft
noise.
under
both
nepa
and
the
1968
amendment,
the
faa
must
and
does
take
into
account
environmental
factors
in
its
decision
making,
but
neither
this
statute
nor
the
other
statute
cited
was
intended
to
make
environmental
factors
controlling
over
all
other
factors.
similarly,
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
the
environmental
quality
improvement
act
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
result
below
nor
is
it
a
statement
that
stated
state
and
local
government
shall
have
primary
responsibility
for
implementing
national
environmental
policy.
these
general
expressions
of
congressional
intent
can
hardly
overcome
the
special
responsibilities
which
have
been
imposed
upon
federal
agencies,
in
particular
the
faa,
by
congress
in
the
1958
act,
the
1962
act,
and
again
in
the
1972
act.
there’s
been
a
reference
here
also
to
the
1972
noise
control
act,
and
i
think
i
should
briefly
mention
that
the
1972
act
does
nothing
to
alter
the
power
relationships
as
they
were--
existed
prior
to
that
act
and
as
they
were
imposed
by
the
1958
and
1968
act.
in
the
1972
act,
congress
reaffirmed
its
intention
to
the
look--
to
the
faa
for
rulemaking
in
the
noise
abatement
field.
the
epa,
under
that
new
act,
is
called
upon
to
use
its
expertise
to
recommend
regulations,
but
authority
to
issue
the
regulations
is
retained
in
the
faa.
and
in
deciding
what
regulations
to
issue,
that
1972
act
again
directs
the
faa
to
balance
the
multiple
national
interests
involved.
both
the
house
and
senate
report
on
the
1972
act
stressed
that
it
was
not
intended
to
change
the
law
with
respect
to
the
respective
authorities
of
the
local
and
state
governments,
the
federal
government,
and
the
airport
proprietors
as
they
existed
before.
i
confess
to
being
somewhat
puzzled
by
the
assertion
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
roe
versus
wade.
looking
again
at
the
slip
opinion
of
that
case,
seems
to
me
that,
and
the
court
of
course
will
be
much
more
familiar
with
its
holding
than
i
am,
there,
a
state
statute
had
invaded
a
personal
zone
of
privacy
and
was,
therefore,
struck
down
as
unconstitutional.
the
court
held
that
the
right
to
personal
privacy
includes
the
abortion
decision.
it’s
rather
baffled
to
me
as
to
how
this
can
vindicate
the
ordinance
before
the
court.
now,
this
case
does
not
deal
with
any
claim
of
invasion
of
personal
rights
as
it
deals
with
the
validity
of
a
local
municipal
ordinance.
if
there’d
been
a
fifth
amendment
taking
or
some
other
sort
of
a
taking,
the
property
owners
might
have
brought
an
action,
but
that
case
has
not
been--
not
here
and
has
not
been
done.
so,
i
could
only
express
at
least
some
puzzlement
as
to
the
effect
of
that
particular
argument
on
the
issues
before
the
court.
there
has
been
some
discussion
here
also
stressing
that
neither
the
statute
nor
the
regulations
involved
specifically
deal
with
curfews
that
they
neither
prevent
them
nor
imposed
them
and,
therefore,
the
locally
imposed
curfews
must
be
permitted.
i
think
if
we
look
back
at
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we’ll
find
that
that
argument
is
not
borne
out.
the
leading
case
on
this
point
is
napier
versus
atlantic
coastline,
272
us
605,
where
the
court
held
that
it
was
without
legal
significance,
i
believe
that
was
mr.
justice
brandeis
who
held
it
was
without
legal
significance
that
there
was
no
explicit
federal
provision
inconsistent
with
the
local
legislation.
the
napier
case
itself,
as
the
court
will
remember,
the
court
struck
down
a
state
statute
on
automatic
fire
boxed
doors
for
locomotives
even
though
the
icc
had
not
dealt
with
that
subject.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
i
know
the
cases.
mr.
warren
christopher
i
don’t
think
they’re
inconsistent
with
the
result
here,
your
honor.
in
every
instance,
you
go
back
to
what
was
the
intention
of
congress,
did
congress
intend
to
preempt
the
field
and,
were
it
hesitant
to
preempt
the
field,
the
fact
that
the
administrative
agency
has
not
issued
an
explicit
regulation
on
the
subject
involved
does
not
prevent
the
subject
involved
from
being
held
to
be
within
the
preempted
area.
mr.
warren
christopher
your
honor,
i
think
if--
there
was
reliance
in
those
cases,
but
it
was
reliance
in
order
to
try
to
eliminate
the
intention
of
congress.
the
failure
of
congress
to
touch
a
subject,
of
course,
is
the
touchstone
here
and
it’s
what
we’re--
what
the
whole
discretion
is
about.
i’d
mentioned
in
passing
also
that
the
napier
case,
followed
by
the
bethlehem
steel
case
in
330
us
767,
once
again
the
court
held
that
the
failure
of
federal
regulations
to
cover
a
particular
subject
matter
did
not
mean
that
that
subject
matter
was
not
within
the
preempted
field.
coming
to
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
here
today,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
once
again
return
to
the
question
of
airspace
management
which
i
think
is
central
to
this
appeal.
it’s
common
ground
at
least
between
the
appellees
and
the
united
states
that
airspace
management
is
exclusively
a
federal
responsibility.
we
say
that
any
entity
which
controls
the
hours
that
aircraft
can
enter
the
navigable
airspace
is
inevitably
involved
in
airspace
management.
as
we
have
seen,
curfews
have
dramatically
have
adverse
effect
on
the
congestion
problem
on
scheduling
and
on
maintenance
on
the
system
as
a
whole,
and
we
urge
that
restrictions
which
has
a
severe
and
adverse
effects
on
transportation,
air
transportation
particularly,
should
come
from
a
centralized
agency
which
have
been
entrusted
by
congress
with
all
aspects
of
airspace
management
thank
you,
your
honors.
