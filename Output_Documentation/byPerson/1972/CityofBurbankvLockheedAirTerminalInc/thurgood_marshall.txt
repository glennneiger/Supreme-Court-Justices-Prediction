justice
thurgood

you’d
have

with
quite
a
few
cases,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me.
does
the

jet
aircraft
in
that
airport?
justice
thurgood

well,
this
airport
in
this
case

had
an
ordinance
on
it
barring
all
jet
aircraft.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assume
it

have
half
and
half.

they

noisy?
justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

mr.
christopher,
do
you
agree
that
nothing
has
been
done
to
establish
curfews
by
the
federal
government,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“nothing”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i--
may
i
exclude
the
federal
government
in
washington?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don’t
agree
that
they
haven’t
done
anything
about
noise
abatement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
haven’t
done
anything
because
people
want
to
sleep
between
11
and
7
in
this
particular
town
of
burbank,
which
is
mr.
sieg’s
point
as
i
understand
it.
justice
thurgood

mr.
friedman,
could
hampstead
pass
an
ordinance
saying
you
couldn’t
fly
over
hampstead
between
11
and
7?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
can
if
it
was
in
the
same
county
as
hampstead.
that
county
can
pass
a
regulation
in
kennedy
saying
that
you
can’t
fly
any
planes
out
in
kennedy
to--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
just
saying,
this
is
so
unimportant,
this
little
burbank
airport,
but
i
think
kennedy
does
have
a
few
flights.
justice
thurgood

the

apply

kennedy.
