when
you
say
nighttime,
do
you
mean
sunset
to
sunrise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
sieg,
supposing
that
there
had--
were
no
issue
of
federal
preemption
here
at
all,
that
congress
had
said
nothing
and
there
really
weren’t
any
argument
that
congress
had
preempted
the
matter.
do
you
think
that
the
citizens
around
the
burbank
airport
would
have
some
sort
of
a
constitutional
claim
against
these
air
carriers
without
any
governmental
action
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn’t
it--
mr.
yost.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn’t
it
one
thing
to
say
that
a
local
ordinance
can’t
regulate
a
federal
activity
that
isn’t
otherwise
covered
by
statute
just
by
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause,
and
it’s
another
thing
to
say
that
a
local
ordinance
is
negated
by
an
affirmative
federal
statute
which,
itself,
occupies
the
field?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
the
appellees’
contention
though,
it’s
not
just
that
the
faa
tower
order
was
preempted
but
that
the
whole
federal
statutory
scheme
was
preempted,
and
the
contrast
i
was
trying
to
draw
was
between
that
type
of
an
argument
and,
say,
an
argument
that
the
city
of
burbank
couldn’t
regulate
military
take
offs
--
take
offs
of
military
planes
quite
apart
from
any
statute
just
because
that’s
a
federal
activity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
suppose
you
could
argue
equally
well
that
if
congress
has
authorized
local
regulation,
commerce--
congress
with
its
plenary
power
over
interstate
commerce
has
removed
any
commerce
argument
from
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
is
it
a
fair
paraphrase
of
your
answer
to
mr.
stewart
that
insofar
as
the
preemption
point
is
concerned
with
congressional
interest
in
uniform
policy,
it
really
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
the
local
initiative
comes
from
the
voluntary
action
of
an
airport
owner
or
from
a
municipal
ordinance
imposing
a
local
requirement
on
a
private
proprietor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
christopher,
what
if
the
burbank
airport
had
voluntarily
on
its
own
motion
decided
to
impose
the
same
restriction
on
flights
between
11
and
7,
would
it--
would
that
decision
be
acceptable
under
your
line
of
analysis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
that’s
a
question
that
really
isn’t
here,
isn’t
it,
mr.
christopher
because,
as
i
gather,
the
burbank
airport
is
almost
entirely
in
the
confines
of
the
city
of
burbank.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn’t
other
constitutional
and
statutory
principles
come
into
play
if
you
had
the
state
of
kentucky
enacting
an
ordinance
that
purported
to
affect
an
airport
that
was
operated
on
the
ohio
side
of
the
river
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
is
this
reservation
of
the
power
in
this
secretary’s
letter
and
other
things
that
you
rely
on
to
private
airport
proprietors
really
kind
of
an
illusory
thing
that
doesn’t
amount
to
much
in
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
time
sequence,
mr.
christopher,
between
the
issuance
of
the
faa
order
and
the
enactment
of
the
municipal
ordinance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
continental
affected
at
all
by
simply
the
application
of
the
burbank
curfew?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
nighttime,
do
you
