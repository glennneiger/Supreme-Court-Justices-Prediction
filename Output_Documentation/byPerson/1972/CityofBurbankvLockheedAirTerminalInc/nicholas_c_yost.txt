mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’ll
first
discuss
the
applicability
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
the
environmental
quality
improvement
act,
and
the
noise
control
act,
and
then
apply
them
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
together,
these
establish
a
national
policy
of
preservation
of
the
environment
in
general
and
of
the
reduction
of
noise
pollution
in
particular.
and,
this
policy
has
been
relegated
by
the
appellees
the
obscurity
of
a
footnote
on
page
67
of
their
brief.
it
deserves
more.
their
rationale
is
that
given
by
the
ninth
circuit,
that
given
the
generality
of
a
national
policy,
it
must
yield
to
the
more
specific
activities
of
the
federal
regulatory
agency
and
the
authorizing
statute
in
the
field
of
aviation,
and
that
contention
quite
simply
is
wrong.
it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
national
environmental
policy
act
to,
rather
than
pour
through
the
statutes
the
codes
one
by
one
and
amend
the
authorizing
bill
for
each
specific
single-purpose
agency
board
or
commission,
to
amend
them
all
in
one
stroke,
and
it
did
that
with
the
enactment
of
nepa,
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
and,
in
the
words
of
senator
jackson,
the
bill’s
author
on
the
floor
in
explaining
the
bill,
this
constitutes
the
statutory
enlargement
of
the
responsibilities
and
concerns
of
all
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government.
what
portions
then
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
are
applicable?
section
101
declares
the
policy,
but
congress
wasn’t
content
with
a
mere
declaration
of
policy
least
it’d
be
considered
merely
hortatory
and
something
not
to
be
adhered
to.
it
inserted
three
devices
which
senator
jackson,
on
the
floor
in
explaining
the
bill,
referred
to
as
“action
forcing.”
now,
of
these
three,
the
one
with
which
people
are
most
familiar
of
is
of
course,
first,
the
environmental
impact
statement.
secondly,
the
requirement
that
there’d
be
consultations
with
experts
in
comment
and,
third,
is
the
one
which
senator
jackson
put
first
and
which
is
the
one
which
is
most
pertinent
to
this
case.
as
he
explained
it
on
the
senate
floor,
“to
ensure
that
the
policies
and
goals
defined
in
this
act
are
infused
into
the
ongoing
programs
and
actions
of
the
federal
government.”
the
act
also
establishes
some
important
action
forcing
procedures.
section
102
authorizes
and
directs
all
federal
agencies
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
to
administer
their
existing
laws
and
regulations
in
conformance
with
the
policies
set
forth
in
this
act,
and
that
essential
wording
then
appears
in
section
102
of
the
act.
three
months
later,
congress
passed
the
environmental
quality
improvement
act,
and
in
that
act
it
reiterated
the
national
policy
and,
secondly,
it
said
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
implementing
that
national
policy
laid
on--
rested
with
the
state
and
local
governments.
and,
finally,
we
get
to
the
noise
control
act.
there
are
four
sections
of
that
that
i
want
to
talk
about.
first,
section
2
(b).
congress
declared
there
was
a
policy
of
preserving
an
environment
for
all
americans
free
from
noise
that
jeopardizes
their
health
or
welfare.
next
is
section
4
(a),
and
that
says
that
every
federal
agency
must
adhere
to
the
policy
which
i
previously
outlined
in
section
2
(b).
now,
the
appellees
in
their
argument,
again
in
a
footnote,
say
that
this
means
only
that
the
faa
must
balance
environmental
considerations
with
the
considerations
of
aviation
which
is,
in
a
sense,
a
truism
but
it
also
reduces
the
act
to
nothing
because
that
was
a
preexisting
obligation,
at
least
since
the
enactment
of
nepa.
the
third
section
i
want
to
refer
to
is
i
think
the
most
important
one,
section
4
(b),
which
says
the
federal
agencies
must
comply
with
state
and
local
noise
requirements
for
the
control
of
noise
to
the
same
extent
that
any
person
is
subject
to
that
requirement
and
the
appellees,
this
time
in
half
of
footnote,
dismissed
that
by
saying
that
the
statement
assumes
the
validity
of
a
local
ordinance.
well,
of
course
that’s
true,
but
that
misses
the
entire
point
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
congress
has
made
the
local
ordinance
valid
by
enacting
section
4
(b).
until
that
time,
any
time
the
state
or
local
government
tried
to
regulate
noise
against
a
federal
entity,
somebody
would
come
in
and
say
“supremacy
clause,
you
can’t
do
that”
and
congress,
by
enacting
4
(b)
has
reversed
that
and
has
said
“it
is
valid,
you
can
do
that
unless
the
specific
measures
prescribed
in
section
4
(b)
for
the
president
to
exempt
a
particular
activity
are
affirmatively
undertaken
by
the
president.
right--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
yes?
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i’m
not
sure
that
i
follow
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
this
particular
case,
were
it
not
for
a
federal
activity
within
the
area,
which
--
activities
such
as
the
faa
purporting
by
its
runway
preference
order
to
take
action
which
would
invalidate
a
local
ordinance,
if
not
for
that
the
local
ordinance
would
be
valid
and
congress
is
now
stepping
in
and
saying
we’ve
got
to
obey
--
the
federal
government
has
to
obey
the
local
ordinance
unless
there’s
affirmative
action
by
the
president.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i
think
those
are
both
aspects
to
it.
one
perhaps
to
which
i
was
addressing
myself
with
more
the
conflict
aspect
and
you’ve
been
addressing
yourself
more
to
the
aspect
of
preemption,
and
it
is
my
contention
that
preemption
may
no
longer
be
envisioned
as
it
has
in
the
past
solely
as
a
question
of
taking
one
statutory
scheme
that
preexisted
the
various
environmental
acts
and,
looking
at
that
alone.
it
becomes
a
question
of
defining
what
you
mean
by
the
field
alleged
to
be
preempted.
i
suppose
the
aviation
purists
will
say
“well,
it’s
the
field
of
aviation”,
and
you
look
at
all
the
federal
government
has
done
in
this
area
in
the
unitary
control
and
so
on,
and
the
environmental
purists
will
say
“well,
it’s
a
field
of
noise.”
this
is
a
state
and
local
matter,
and
you’ve
got
to
have
one
authority,
a
unitary
control
all
over
that
because
if
you
control
some
noise
sources
but
not
other
noise
sources,
you
haven’t
gotten
anywhere.
well,
both
of
those
really
miss
the
point.
the
point
of
this
case
is
that
neither
a
pure
aviation
case
nor
a
pure
noise
case,
but
it’s
a
case
which
involves
the
interrelationship
of
the
two.
and,
here,
i
think
it’s
important
to
get
into
just
what
has
happened
in
the
field
of
the
regulation
of
aircraft
noise.
is
there,
to
use
the
california
supreme
court’s
words
in
loma
portal,
what
is
described
as
a
lacuna
in
the
federal
regulatory
scheme.
let’s
look
at
the
possibilities
for
regulation
of
aircraft
and
airport
noise.
you
look
at
land
use,
sighting,
compatible
zoning
around
an
airport,
federal
governments
do
nothing.
you
look
at
single-event
noise
limit
such
as
we’ve
heard
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
has
been
applying
since
the
1950s.
federal
government
has
done
nothing
though,
of
course,
new
york
has.
you
look
at
the
cumulative
mechanism
for
watching
the
whole
--
overall
exposure
to
noise
and
reducing
that,
the
system
which
we
are
now
experimenting
with
in
california.
section
7
(a)
3
of
the
noise
control
act
says
that
that’s
one
of
the
matters
that
epa
has
to
study
and
to
report
back
to
congress,
and
i
know
that
they
are
watching
the
california
experiment.
you
look
at
time
limitations
such
as
burbank
imposed,
santa
monica
imposed.
again,
the
federal
government
has
done
nothing
except
at
washington
national
which
it
owns.
you
look
at
mandating
the
use
of
quieter
airplanes,
something
los
angeles
has
proposed
on
which
the
federal
government
has
done
nothing.
you
look
at
runway
preference
orders,
there’s
an
area
where
the
federal
government
has
taken
some
steps,
though
we’ve
learned
from
port
authority
against
eastern
airlines
that
that’s
ultimately
the
responsibility
of
the
proprietor
rather
than
federal
government.
and
noise--
finally,
noise
limitation
on
individual
aircraft
types,
the
so-called
type
certification
of
a
new
aircraft
and,
here,
the
federal
government
has
done
a
little
but
not
very
much
such
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
noise
control
act
shows
a
letter
from
senator
tunney
to
senator
muskie
to
the
effect
that
by
1975,
18.6%of
the
aircraft
will
have
been
controlled
in
that
way.
in
other
words,
in
the
field
of
the
regulation
of
aircraft
and
airport
noise,
taking
both
these
fields
together
and
meshing
them,
the
federal
government
has
just
barely
stepped
onto
the
edge
of
that
field.
it’s
in
light
of
that
that
i
think
this
matter
must
be
viewed.
so,
what
statutes
then
are
the
statutes
where--
which
are
applicable
to
this
field?
it’s
not,
as
would’ve
been
the
case
five
years
ago,
just
the
federal
aviation
act.
it
is,
instead,
the
federal
aviation
act,
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
the
environmental
quality
improvement
act,
and
the
noise
control
act.
it’s
no
longer
enough
just
to
view
single-purpose
regulatory
statutes
by
themselves
without
reference
to
the
more
recent
congressional
enactments
which
are
sort
of
reduced
to
congressional
dicta
by
appellees’
views,
sort
of
words
in
the
form
of
statute
but
without
the
command
of
statute.
so,
we
have
these
action
forcing
devices,
that
there
is
a
national
policy,
that
all
branches
shall
enforce
that
national
policy,
that
congress
has
placed
primary
responsibility
for
that
national
policy
upon
state
and
local
governments.
with
respect
to
noise
in
particular,
congress
has
said
that
absent
a
specific
affirmative
presidential
exemption,
federal
agencies
are
bound
by
the
state
and
local
requirements.
and,
the
city
of
burbank
has
implemented
that
state
--
that
national
policy.
so,
what
do
we
have?
a
national
environmental
policy
which,
of
the
three
branches
of
government,
the
legislative
branch
is
originated.
the
executive
branch
will,
in
a
few
moments,
appear
in
support
of
as
a
friend
of
the
court.
we
ask
that
the
third
branch
of
government,
this
court,
lend
its
support
to
the
national
environmental
policy
and
make
it
whole.
thank
you.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
well,
only
insofar
as
in
viewing
a
commerce
burden
issue.
i
think
the
united
states
brief
handles
that
rather
well,
but
only
insofar
as
one
of
the
matters
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
burden--
is
the
congressional
enactment
concerning
the
environment.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
they--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
well,
i
think
i
have
not
argued
it,
but
i
will
argue
it,
that
it
becomes
sort
of
ridiculous
to
put
aside
the
recent
congressional
enactments
in
the
area
if
you
then
say
that
it’s
got
to
be
viewed--
the
burden
question
has
to
be
viewed
in
sort
of
abstract
apart
from
what
congress’
most
recent--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
that
is
an
accurate
statement.
it
certainly
is,
justice
stewart.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
that’s
correct.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
that’s
right.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
that’s
correct.
i
though
justice
rehnquist’s
statement
of
this--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i
would
take
the
same
view
that
the
united
states
has,
justice
marshall,
that
each
airport
would
have
to
be
viewed
by
itself
on
the
commerce
clause
issue.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i
am
reluctant
to
venture
on
an
opinion
on
something
which
we
haven’t
pried
and
there’s
no
record
on.
in
the
particular
facts
of
the
situation,
they
were
barring
where
there
was
in
fact
no
burden
on
interstate
commerce
because
there
were
no
interstate
commerce
flights--
flight
shown.
i
would
want
to
examine
a
record
which
fully
went
into
the
question
of
the
implications
for
that
particular
airport--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i
think,
and
again
looking
at
the
us
analysis
of
that,
the
solicitor
general’s
analysis,
that,
as
a
generality,
the
answer
is
yes.
however,
it
would
have
to
be
viewed
in
its
specific
application
the
importance
of
the
particular
airport
in
the
nationwide
scheme,
and
so
on.
thank
you.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’ll
first
discuss
the
applicability
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
the
environmental
quality
improvement
act,
and
the
noise
control
act,
and
then
apply
them
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
together,
these
establish
a
national
policy
of
preservation
of
the
environment
in
general
and
of
the
reduction
of
noise
pollution
in
particular.
and,
this
policy
has
been
relegated
by
the
appellees
the
obscurity
of
a
footnote
on
page
67
of
their
brief.
it
deserves
more.
their
rationale
is
that
given
by
the
ninth
circuit,
that
given
the
generality
of
a
national
policy,
it
must
yield
to
the
more
specific
activities
of
the
federal
regulatory
agency
and
the
authorizing
statute
in
the
field
of
aviation,
and
that
contention
quite
simply
is
wrong.
it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
national
environmental
policy
act
to,
rather
than
pour
through
the
statutes
the
codes
one
by
one
and
amend
the
authorizing
bill
for
each
specific
single-purpose
agency
board
or
commission,
to
amend
them
all
in
one
stroke,
and
it
did
that
with
the
enactment
of
nepa,
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
and,
in
the
words
of
senator
jackson,
the
bill’s
author
on
the
floor
in
explaining
the
bill,
this
constitutes
the
statutory
enlargement
of
the
responsibilities
and
concerns
of
all
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government.
what
portions
then
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
are
applicable?
section
101
declares
the
policy,
but
congress
wasn’t
content
with
a
mere
declaration
of
policy
least
it’d
be
considered
merely
hortatory
and
something
not
to
be
adhered
to.
it
inserted
three
devices
which
senator
jackson,
on
the
floor
in
explaining
the
bill,
referred
to
as
“action
forcing.”
now,
of
these
three,
the
one
with
which
people
are
most
familiar
of
is
of
course,
first,
the
environmental
impact
statement.
secondly,
the
requirement
that
there’d
be
consultations
with
experts
in
comment
and,
third,
is
the
one
which
senator
jackson
put
first
and
which
is
the
one
which
is
most
pertinent
to
this
case.
as
he
explained
it
on
the
senate
floor,
“to
ensure
that
the
policies
and
goals
defined
in
this
act
are
infused
into
the
ongoing
programs
and
actions
of
the
federal
government.”
the
act
also
establishes
some
important
action
forcing
procedures.
section
102
authorizes
and
directs
all
federal
agencies
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
to
administer
their
existing
laws
and
regulations
in
conformance
with
the
policies
set
forth
in
this
act,
and
that
essential
wording
then
appears
in
section
102
of
the
act.
three
months
later,
congress
passed
the
environmental
quality
improvement
act,
and
in
that
act
it
reiterated
the
national
policy
and,
secondly,
it
said
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
implementing
that
national
policy
laid
on--
rested
with
the
state
and
local
governments.
and,
finally,
we
get
to
the
noise
control
act.
there
are
four
sections
of
that
that
i
want
to
talk
about.
first,
section
2
(b).
congress
declared
there
was
a
policy
of
preserving
an
environment
for
all
americans
free
from
noise
that
jeopardizes
their
health
or
welfare.
next
is
section
4
(a),
and
that
says
that
every
federal
agency
must
adhere
to
the
policy
which
i
previously
outlined
in
section
2
(b).
now,
the
appellees
in
their
argument,
again
in
a
footnote,
say
that
this
means
only
that
the
faa
must
balance
environmental
considerations
with
the
considerations
of
aviation
which
is,
in
a
sense,
a
truism
but
it
also
reduces
the
act
to
nothing
because
that
was
a
preexisting
obligation,
at
least
since
the
enactment
of
nepa.
the
third
section
i
want
to
refer
to
is
i
think
the
most
important
one,
section
4
(b),
which
says
the
federal
agencies
must
comply
with
state
and
local
noise
requirements
for
the
control
of
noise
to
the
same
extent
that
any
person
is
subject
to
that
requirement
and
the
appellees,
this
time
in
half
of
footnote,
dismissed
that
by
saying
that
the
statement
assumes
the
validity
of
a
local
ordinance.
well,
of
course
that’s
true,
but
that
misses
the
entire
point
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
congress
has
made
the
local
ordinance
valid
by
enacting
section
4
(b).
until
that
time,
any
time
the
state
or
local
government
tried
to
regulate
noise
against
a
federal
entity,
somebody
would
come
in
and
say
“supremacy
clause,
you
can’t
do
that”
and
congress,
by
enacting
4
(b)
has
reversed
that
and
has
said
“it
is
valid,
you
can
do
that
unless
the
specific
measures
prescribed
in
section
4
(b)
for
the
president
to
exempt
a
particular
activity
are
affirmatively
undertaken
by
the
president.
right--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
yes?
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i’m
not
sure
that
i
follow
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
this
particular
case,
were
it
not
for
a
federal
activity
within
the
area,
which
--
activities
such
as
the
faa
purporting
by
its
runway
preference
order
to
take
action
which
would
invalidate
a
local
ordinance,
if
not
for
that
the
local
ordinance
would
be
valid
and
congress
is
now
stepping
in
and
saying
we’ve
got
to
obey
--
the
federal
government
has
to
obey
the
local
ordinance
unless
there’s
affirmative
action
by
the
president.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i
think
those
are
both
aspects
to
it.
one
perhaps
to
which
i
was
addressing
myself
with
more
the
conflict
aspect
and
you’ve
been
addressing
yourself
more
to
the
aspect
of
preemption,
and
it
is
my
contention
that
preemption
may
no
longer
be
envisioned
as
it
has
in
the
past
solely
as
a
question
of
taking
one
statutory
scheme
that
preexisted
the
various
environmental
acts
and,
looking
at
that
alone.
it
becomes
a
question
of
defining
what
you
mean
by
the
field
alleged
to
be
preempted.
i
suppose
the
aviation
purists
will
say
“well,
it’s
the
field
of
aviation”,
and
you
look
at
all
the
federal
government
has
done
in
this
area
in
the
unitary
control
and
so
on,
and
the
environmental
purists
will
say
“well,
it’s
a
field
of
noise.”
this
is
a
state
and
local
matter,
and
you’ve
got
to
have
one
authority,
a
unitary
control
all
over
that
because
if
you
control
some
noise
sources
but
not
other
noise
sources,
you
haven’t
gotten
anywhere.
well,
both
of
those
really
miss
the
point.
the
point
of
this
case
is
that
neither
a
pure
aviation
case
nor
a
pure
noise
case,
but
it’s
a
case
which
involves
the
interrelationship
of
the
two.
and,
here,
i
think
it’s
important
to
get
into
just
what
has
happened
in
the
field
of
the
regulation
of
aircraft
noise.
is
there,
to
use
the
california
supreme
court’s
words
in
loma
portal,
what
is
described
as
a
lacuna
in
the
federal
regulatory
scheme.
let’s
look
at
the
possibilities
for
regulation
of
aircraft
and
airport
noise.
you
look
at
land
use,
sighting,
compatible
zoning
around
an
airport,
federal
governments
do
nothing.
you
look
at
single-event
noise
limit
such
as
we’ve
heard
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
has
been
applying
since
the
1950s.
federal
government
has
done
nothing
though,
of
course,
new
york
has.
you
look
at
the
cumulative
mechanism
for
watching
the
whole
--
overall
exposure
to
noise
and
reducing
that,
the
system
which
we
are
now
experimenting
with
in
california.
section
7
(a)
3
of
the
noise
control
act
says
that
that’s
one
of
the
matters
that
epa
has
to
study
and
to
report
back
to
congress,
and
i
know
that
they
are
watching
the
california
experiment.
you
look
at
time
limitations
such
as
burbank
imposed,
santa
monica
imposed.
again,
the
federal
government
has
done
nothing
except
at
washington
national
which
it
owns.
you
look
at
mandating
the
use
of
quieter
airplanes,
something
los
angeles
has
proposed
on
which
the
federal
government
has
done
nothing.
you
look
at
runway
preference
orders,
there’s
an
area
where
the
federal
government
has
taken
some
steps,
though
we’ve
learned
from
port
authority
against
eastern
airlines
that
that’s
ultimately
the
responsibility
of
the
proprietor
rather
than
federal
government.
and
noise--
finally,
noise
limitation
on
individual
aircraft
types,
the
so-called
type
certification
of
a
new
aircraft
and,
here,
the
federal
government
has
done
a
little
but
not
very
much
such
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
noise
control
act
shows
a
letter
from
senator
tunney
to
senator
muskie
to
the
effect
that
by
1975,
18.6%of
the
aircraft
will
have
been
controlled
in
that
way.
in
other
words,
in
the
field
of
the
regulation
of
aircraft
and
airport
noise,
taking
both
these
fields
together
and
meshing
them,
the
federal
government
has
just
barely
stepped
onto
the
edge
of
that
field.
it’s
in
light
of
that
that
i
think
this
matter
must
be
viewed.
so,
what
statutes
then
are
the
statutes
where--
which
are
applicable
to
this
field?
it’s
not,
as
would’ve
been
the
case
five
years
ago,
just
the
federal
aviation
act.
it
is,
instead,
the
federal
aviation
act,
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
the
environmental
quality
improvement
act,
and
the
noise
control
act.
it’s
no
longer
enough
just
to
view
single-purpose
regulatory
statutes
by
themselves
without
reference
to
the
more
recent
congressional
enactments
which
are
sort
of
reduced
to
congressional
dicta
by
appellees’
views,
sort
of
words
in
the
form
of
statute
but
without
the
command
of
statute.
so,
we
have
these
action
forcing
devices,
that
there
is
a
national
policy,
that
all
branches
shall
enforce
that
national
policy,
that
congress
has
placed
primary
responsibility
for
that
national
policy
upon
state
and
local
governments.
with
respect
to
noise
in
particular,
congress
has
said
that
absent
a
specific
affirmative
presidential
exemption,
federal
agencies
are
bound
by
the
state
and
local
requirements.
and,
the
city
of
burbank
has
implemented
that
state
--
that
national
policy.
so,
what
do
we
have?
a
national
environmental
policy
which,
of
the
three
branches
of
government,
the
legislative
branch
is
originated.
the
executive
branch
will,
in
a
few
moments,
appear
in
support
of
as
a
friend
of
the
court.
we
ask
that
the
third
branch
of
government,
this
court,
lend
its
support
to
the
national
environmental
policy
and
make
it
whole.
thank
you.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
well,
only
insofar
as
in
viewing
a
commerce
burden
issue.
i
think
the
united
states
brief
handles
that
rather
well,
but
only
insofar
as
one
of
the
matters
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
burden--
is
the
congressional
enactment
concerning
the
environment.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
they--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
well,
i
think
i
have
not
argued
it,
but
i
will
argue
it,
that
it
becomes
sort
of
ridiculous
to
put
aside
the
recent
congressional
enactments
in
the
area
if
you
then
say
that
it’s
got
to
be
viewed--
the
burden
question
has
to
be
viewed
in
sort
of
abstract
apart
from
what
congress’
most
recent--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
that
is
an
accurate
statement.
it
certainly
is,
justice
stewart.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
that’s
correct.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
that’s
right.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
that’s
correct.
i
though
justice
rehnquist’s
statement
of
this--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i
would
take
the
same
view
that
the
united
states
has,
justice
marshall,
that
each
airport
would
have
to
be
viewed
by
itself
on
the
commerce
clause
issue.
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i
am
reluctant
to
venture
on
an
opinion
on
something
which
we
haven’t
pried
and
there’s
no
record
on.
in
the
particular
facts
of
the
situation,
they
were
barring
where
there
was
in
fact
no
burden
on
interstate
commerce
because
there
were
no
interstate
commerce
flights--
flight
shown.
i
would
want
to
examine
a
record
which
fully
went
into
the
question
of
the
implications
for
that
particular
airport--
mr.
nicholas
c.
yost
i
think,
and
again
looking
at
the
us
analysis
of
that,
the
solicitor
general’s
analysis,
that,
as
a
generality,
the
answer
is
yes.
however,
it
would
have
to
be
viewed
in
its
specific
application
the
importance
of
the
particular
airport
in
the
nationwide
scheme,
and
so
on.
thank
you.
