mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
both
of
the
lower
courts
in
this
case,
a
brief
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
taking
the
position
that
this
ordinance
was
invalid.
the
argument
we
made
was
that
there
was
preemption
of
the
subject
of
noise
by
the
federal
government,
and
this
ordinance
constituted
an
impermissible
burden
upon
interstate
commerce.
the
brief’s
discussion
of
the
commerce
clause--
sorry,
of
the
preemption
point
had
almost
no
analysis
of
the
legislative
history.
it
was
discussed
one
or
two
places
very
briefly,
a
couple
of
quotations
and
references
to
committee
reports.
now,
when
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal,
the
federal
government
undertook
a
lengthy
and
detailed
analysis
of
this
case
and
of
the
issues.
the
department
of
transportation,
in
which
the
federal
aviation
administration
is
a
constituent
agency,
studied
the
case
very
carefully,
and
the
department
of
justice
itself
both
in
the
civil
division
and
the
solicitor
general’s
office
studied
the
legislative
history
in
depth.
we
went
into
the
thing
in
great
detail,
and
the
unanimous
conclusion
of
all
of
these
people
after
this
study
was
that
the
prior
position
we
had
taken
on
behalf
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
preemption
and
commerce
clause
issues
was
erroneous
and,
accordingly,
the
united
states
has
now
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
and
i
am
arguing
here
today,
taking
the
position
that
the
burbank
ordinance
is
valid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
faa
was
an
amicus
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
we
feel
we
have
an
obligation
to
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
present
to
this
court
the
point
of
view
that
we
think
is
the
right--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
simply
just
to
rephrase
it,
i
think
that
it’s
unfortunate
that
the
case
developed
this
way,
but
before
this
court
there
has
been
a
complete
development
of
the
fullest
adversary
positions.
in
fact,
are--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
might
say
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
other
hand,
our
opponents
have
filed
a
separate
brief,
a
long
43-page
brief
specifically
answering
our
point.
so,
there’s
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
adversary
process
has
been
fully
developed
before
this--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
the
district
court
and
the
court,
but
there’s
no
question,
mr.
justice,
in
this
case
with
respect
to
any
of
the
facts.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
failure
to
present
our
arguments
in
the
lower
courts
may
have
been
unfair
in
the
sense
of
not
presenting
sufficient
evidence
or
a
case
in
which
the
legal
arguments,
perhaps
because
they
were
not
as
fully
developed
in
the
lower
courts
have,
in
any
way,
prejudiced
the
other
side
in
this
court.
the
issues
are
fully
developed
and
they
are,
we
think,
legal
issues
and
i
acknowledge
it’s
an
unusual
situation.
unfortunately,
it’s
not
perhaps
the
first
time
that
the
federal
government
has
shifted
position
in
this
court,
but
we
think--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
not
a
happy
situation--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it’s
one
that
we
feel
it’s
our
obligation--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and,
of
course,
the
governmental
interest
involved
in
this
case,
also
the
interests
of
the
department
of
transportation
which
are
broader
perhaps
than
those
of
the
federal
aviation
administration.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
has
happened,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
say
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
stewart.
it’s
an
unhappy
situation,
but
one
i
think
that
is
inevitable
under
the
complicated
government
system
that
we
have
today.
now,
the
burbank
ordinance
in
this
case
reflects
an
exercise
of
traditional
police
power
of
the
states.
what’s
involved
here
basically,
by--
through
the
exercise
of
this
ordinance,
is
the
abatement
of
a
nuisance,
a
traditional
nuisance:
noise.
this
is
a--
the
usual
area
of
police
power.
the
state
has
the
authority
to
deal
with
noxious
odors,
with
unpleasant
sights,
and
little
loud
noises.
there’s
no
question
about
that,
and
this
court
itself
recognized
in
the
rice
case
in
331
us
that
when
you’re
dealing
with
the
traditional
power
of
the
state,
the
police
power,
to
deal
with
these
subjects,
that
power
is
superseded
by
federal
legislation
only
if
that
was
the
clear
and
manifest
purpose
of
congress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we--
our
position
is
that
the
airport
has
the
authority
to
control
all
noises
with
the
exception
that
it’s
the
control
power
of--
at
the
airport
it
has
no
power
to
control
flight
of
aircraft.
that
is
the
distinction
we--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think,
as
far
as
preemption
is
concerned,
just
as
far
as
preemption
is
concerned
i
would
think
that
the
state
would
have
the
authority
if
it
wished
to
prohibit
jet
flights
in
and
out
of
a
particular
airport.
to
answer
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
earlier,
i
would
think,
as
far
as
preemption
is
concerned,
and
i
would
stress
just
the
preemption
point,
that
there’s
nothing
in
the
regulatory
scheme
that
would
bar
the
city
of
burbank
from
prohibiting
all
jet
aircraft
using
the
flight.
indeed,
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
commerce
is
another
issue,
but
i’m
just
talking
about
preemption.
in
fact,
there’s
nothing
in
either
the
preemption
of
the
commerce
clause
that
would
prevent
the
burbank
airport
from
shutting
itself
down
if
it
wanted
to.
there
might
be
other
contract--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
our
position,
mr.
justice,
is
that,
under
the
statutes,
the
congress
has
not
thus
far
preempted
the
local
governmental
bodies
from
dealing
with
the
question
of
noise
at
the
airport
level.
this
is
our
position.
we
say
that
the
plenary
power
of
congress
over
interstate
commerce
is
broad
enough
to
enable
it
to
exercise
this
power.
we
acknowledge
that
congress
could,
if
it
wished,
say
there
shall
be
no
curfews
at
airports
or
that
there
shall
be
prescribed.
our
position
is
congress
hasn’t
done
it
and
that
the
legislative
scheme
indicates
that
while
it
has
left
great
responsibility
to
the
faa
in
this
area,
the
faa
itself
has
not
thus
far
undertaken
to
regulate
this.
now,
i--
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
distinction
between
the
airport
operator
as
a
proprietor
and
the
airport--
the
authority
of
the
local
government--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
respond
on
two
levels
to
this.
first,
this
is
true,
i
suppose,
in
any
case
where
the
state
undertakes
to
obey
the
nuisance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
factually,
yes.
in
fact,
we
suggest
that
that
fact
indicates
how
anomalous
it
would
be
if
congress--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
i
suggest,
mr.
justice,
the
question
is
whether
the
congress
has
manifested
an
intention
to
preempt
this
field
and,
under
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
effect
is
that
congress
has
preempted
only
basically
the
burbank
airport.
it
said
that,
as
far
as
burbank
is
concerned,
burbank
has
no
authority
to
impose
this
curfew.
as
far
as
the
los
angeles
international
airport,
20
miles
away,
a
much
larger
airport,
under
its
theory,
that
airport
does
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
curfew
because
it
is
the
proprietor.
now,
we
think--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s--
we
think,
mr.
justice,
that
when
the
various
committee
reports
referred
to
the
authority
of
the
airport
owner
of
local
municipal
body
as
the
proprietor
of
the
airport,
they
were
not
attempting
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
local
government
body
as
proprietor
of
the
airport
and
the
local
government
body
exercising
its
police
power.
we
think
that
all
of
these
statements
were
made
at
a
time
that
was
generally
regarded
that
generally
believes
that
the
airports
of
this
country,
the
major
airports,
were
being
used,
being
run
and
operated
by
local
governmental
bodies
and
this
was
just--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statements
talked
about
operators
of
airports,
but--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t,
in
all
fairness,
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice.
we
have
other
indications
to
the
contrary
in
the
legislative
history
of
this.
if
i
may
refer
to
an
item
at
page
29
of
our
brief
which
is
a
report
made
by
the
house
of
commerce
committee
in
1962
after
a
three-year
study
of
the
whole
problem
of
noise
at
airports
and
this
is
paragraph
7.03,
and
this
is
what
the
committee
says
“until
federal
action
is
taken,
the
local
governmental
authorities
must
be
deemed
to
possess
the
police
power
necessary
to
protect
their
citizens
and
property
from
the
unreasonable
invasion
of
aircraft
noise.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
so
far
as
the
question
of
preemption
is
concerned,
our
answer
is
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
may
be
a
problem
under
the
commerce
clause,
we
don’t
know.
there
may
be
a
problem
under
the
commerce
clause
because,
obviously,
the
impact
upon
commerce.
the
ban
on
jet
flights
at
night
from
the
los
angeles
airport
may
be
a
very
different
thing
than
the
ban
on
the
take
off
of
jet
flights
at
the
burbank
airport
where
the
record
shows
there
were
no
commercial
interstate
flights
at
all,
but
insofar
as
the
question
of
preemption
is
concerned,
yes,
we
think
there’s
nothing
in
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
that
would
bar
the
city
of
los
angeles
from
adopting
such
an
ordinance.
and
if
i
may
just
refer
to
one
other
thing,
mr.
yost
spoke
about
the
noise
control
act
of
1972.
in
addition
to
the
general
provisions
dealing
with
noise,
there’s
a
specific
provision
of
that
statute
relating
to
aircraft
noise,
and
one
of
the
things
that
this
statute
did
was
to
direct
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
make
a
study
and
report
to
commerce
within
nine
months
on
a
variety
of
topic
relating
to
aircraft
noise,
one
of
which
was
additional
measures
available
to
airport
operators
and
local
governments
to
control
airport
noise.
such
a
study
is
now
being
made.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
this
very
clearly
indicates
that
the
congress
that
passed
this
law
wanted
to
see
what
could
be
done
by
both
the
local
operators
and
by
the
local
governmental
authorities
to
deal
with
aircraft
noise,
and
it
seems
it
would
be
rather
anomalous,
we
think,
for
congress
on
the
one
hand
to
have
been
requesting
this
additional
information
to
see
how
we
could
implement
the
power
in
the
local
government
agencies
and,
at
the
same
time,
in
effect
to
be
saying
“but
we’ve
taken
away
from
the
local
government
authorities
any
power
to
deal
with
this.”
we
think
the
basic
thrust
of
all
of
this
legislative
history
is
that
there’s
nothing
in
this
act
to
indicate
that
congress
ever
intended
at
least
until
there’d
been
further
action
by
the
federal
government,
either
the
congress
or
the
faa,
to
bar
the
local
governmental
authorities
from
dealing
with
this
serious
and
difficult
problem
of
noise,
and
that’s
the
way
it
stands
and
we
think,
on
that
basis,
the
burbank
ordinance
has
not
been
preempted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
this--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
discussed
this
in
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
unfortunately,
with
the
limited
time
available
i
couldn’t
cover
it
but
our
answer--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
have
dealt
with
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
five
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
those
five
minutes.
the
critical
distinction,
we
think,
that
appears
in
this
legislation
in
terms
of
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
here
was
between
the
regulation
of
flying,
all
aspects
of
flying
which
we
think
has
been
preempted
by
the
federal
legislation
and
the
regulation
of
airports
which
is
not
the
comprehensive
regulation
as
a
regulation
of
the
airspace,
a
regulation
of
safety,
a
regulation
of
the
flight
of
aircraft.
but,
we
think
it
is
not
a
regulation
of
the
airport
itself.
now,
of
course,
things
that
happen
on
the
airport
are
related
to
flight.
obviously,
if
the
airport
refuses
to
build
an
additional
runway
that
is
necessary,
it’s
going
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
flight
to
take
place,
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
we
think
that
congress
was
referring
to
when
it
keeps
speaking
in
these
terms,
and
i’d
like
to
refer
specifically
to
the
letter
from
the
secretary
at
the
appendix
to
the
appellant’s
brief
which
mr.
christopher
referred
to.
what
the
court’s
letter
said
was
the
courts
have
held
that
the
fed--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
first
unnumbered
page
of
the
appendix
after
the
green-blue
slip
at
the
end.
the
courts
have
held
that
the
federal
government
presently
preempts
the
field
of
noise
regulation
insofar
as
it
involved
controlling
the
flight
of
aircraft,
and
then
the
next
sentence
they
cite
a
case
called
the
town
of
hempstead
which
was
just
that.
the
village
of
hempstead
attempted
to
control
the
flight
of
aircraft
in
and
out
of
kennedy
airport
by
saying
that
a
plane
could
not
fly
over
the
village
of
hempstead
if
it
emitted
noise
beyond
a
certain
level.
that’s
what
they
were
talking
about.
we
think
it’s
repeated
again
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph.
state
and
local
governments
will
remain
unable
to
use
their
police
powers
to
control
aircraft
noise
by
regulating
the
flight
of
aircrafts
and,
of
course,
that’s
precisely
what
the
preferential
runway
regulation
that’s
involved
in
this
case
attempts
to
do.
that
controls
the
flight
of
aircraft.
that
determines
how
a
plane
is
to
takeoff
in
which
direction.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that--
but
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
with
reference
to
an
ordinance
that
attempted
to
control
the
flight
of
aircraft.
what
hampstead
was
attempting
to
do
was
to
control
the
way
in
which
planes
landed
and
took
off
and
approached
the
kennedy
airport
by
saying
planes
which
make
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
noise
cannot
fly
over
our
city
and
that’s,
we
think,
what
congress
had
reference
to
when
it
spoke
of
controlling
the
flight
of
aircraft.
and,
we
think
the
whole
policy
that’s
reflected
in
this
congressional
debate
and
the
faa’s
consideration
of
it
is
the
recognition
that
when
you’re
dealing
with
such
things
as
whether
a
plane
should
or
shouldn’t
be
permitted
to
takeoff
from
an
airport,
that’s
a
matter
of
fundamental
local
policy.
there
are
conflicting
interests
involved.
on
the
one
hand,
the
interests
of
the
traveling
public
and
the
industry
in
the
area
of
getting
the
best
possible
air
service
obtainable.
on
the
other
hand,
there’s
an
equally
strong,
perhaps
a
greater,
interest
of
the
people,
the
interest
of
the
people
in
these
areas
of
being
able
to
get
a
good
night’s
sleep.
and,
this
is
the
kind
of
balancing
of
conveniences
that
traditionally
is
left
to
the
local
government
bodies
to
decide.
the
town
council
of
burbank
made
the
judgment
that
whatever
may
be
the
effects
of
this
on
air
service,
and
it
seems
quite
clear
it’s
minimal
here,
that
nevertheless
that
adverse
effect
was
more
than
outweighed
of
a--
by
the
benefits
to
the
people
in
this
surrounding
area
of
having
freedom
from
the
noise
when
they’re
trying
to
sleep.
now,
the
runway
preference
order,
i
might
add
one
other
thing
about
it,
that
there
is
no
authority.
the
faa
informs
us
and
an
air
tower
controller
to
impose
a
curfew.
the
only
thing
he
can
do
is
these
preference
runways.
the
preference
runways
are
not
mandatory.
page
444
of
the
record
which
contains
the
text
of
the
pro--
the
order,
the
second
full
sentence
in
that
paragraph
is
saying
the
procedures
are
not
mandatory
on
the
part
of
the
pilots.
however,
traffic
controllers
must
be
noise
abate
and
conscious
and
emphasize
noise
abatement
to
obtain
the
highest
degree
of
voluntary
cooperation
from
pilots.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say,
most
clearly
not,
mr.
justice.
hampstead
could
not
do
that.
that
would
be
a
regulation
flight.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
flying
over
hampstead.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
hampstead--
if
there
were
an
airport
within
the
city
of
hampstead,
hampstead
could
say
no
plane
could
takeoff
from
that
airport
between
the
hours
of
11
and
7.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
far
as
the
federal
aviation
act
is
concerned,
yes,
mr.
justice.
that
might
present
a
different
commerce
problem
at
kennedy
than
it
presents
in
burbank,
but
as
far--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
kennedy
has
many
flights
but,
mr.
justice,
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
commerce,
it
seems
to
us,
it
does
make
a
substantial
difference
whether
you’re
dealing
with
a
little
airport
like
burbank
which
has
no
commercially
scheduled
flights
in--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
respect
to
preemption,
yes.
that
is,
if
i
may
restate
it,
as
far
as
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
is
concerned,
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
does
not
operate
to
prevent
an
aircraft--
to
prevent
an
airport
from
being
told
it
cannot
take--
permit
certain
noisy
things
at
the
airport
as
distinguished
from
the
actual
commencement
of
the
flight.
once
the
plane
is
on
the
runway
and
starts
to
takeoff
even
though
that’s
in
the
airport,
that’s
an
integral
part
of
the
flight.
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
flight,
and
that
is
preempted,
and
all
that
we’re
saying
is
it
is
not
preempted
now,
at
least
thus
far.
congress
has
not
attempted
to
take
over
the
regulation
of
airports.
congress
could
do
it.
under
its
broad
power
of
interstate
commerce,
commerce
could
do
it,
either
itself
directly
or
congress
could
do
it
acting
through
the
faa
and
maybe
someday
it
will
do
it.
the
matter
is
understudied.
maybe
a
year
from
now,
the
faa
will
conclude
either
that
there
should
be
a
ban
on
curfews
or
decide
to
put
in
curfews.
our
point
is
that
unless
and
until
congress
affirmatively
does
that,
unless
that
happens,
this
matter
is
within
the
control
and
authority
of
the
local
police
power.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
both
of
the
lower
courts
in
this
case,
a
brief
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
taking
the
position
that
this
ordinance
was
invalid.
the
argument
we
made
was
that
there
was
preemption
of
the
subject
of
noise
by
the
federal
government,
and
this
ordinance
constituted
an
impermissible
burden
upon
interstate
commerce.
the
brief’s
discussion
of
the
commerce
clause--
sorry,
of
the
preemption
point
had
almost
no
analysis
of
the
legislative
history.
it
was
discussed
one
or
two
places
very
briefly,
a
couple
of
quotations
and
references
to
committee
reports.
now,
when
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal,
the
federal
government
undertook
a
lengthy
and
detailed
analysis
of
this
case
and
of
the
issues.
the
department
of
transportation,
in
which
the
federal
aviation
administration
is
a
constituent
agency,
studied
the
case
very
carefully,
and
the
department
of
justice
itself
both
in
the
civil
division
and
the
solicitor
general’s
office
studied
the
legislative
history
in
depth.
we
went
into
the
thing
in
great
detail,
and
the
unanimous
conclusion
of
all
of
these
people
after
this
study
was
that
the
prior
position
we
had
taken
on
behalf
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
preemption
and
commerce
clause
issues
was
erroneous
and,
accordingly,
the
united
states
has
now
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
and
i
am
arguing
here
today,
taking
the
position
that
the
burbank
ordinance
is
valid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
faa
was
an
amicus
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
we
feel
we
have
an
obligation
to
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
present
to
this
court
the
point
of
view
that
we
think
is
the
right--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
simply
just
to
rephrase
it,
i
think
that
it’s
unfortunate
that
the
case
developed
this
way,
but
before
this
court
there
has
been
a
complete
development
of
the
fullest
adversary
positions.
in
fact,
are--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
might
say
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
other
hand,
our
opponents
have
filed
a
separate
brief,
a
long
43-page
brief
specifically
answering
our
point.
so,
there’s
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
adversary
process
has
been
fully
developed
before
this--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
the
district
court
and
the
court,
but
there’s
no
question,
mr.
justice,
in
this
case
with
respect
to
any
of
the
facts.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
failure
to
present
our
arguments
in
the
lower
courts
may
have
been
unfair
in
the
sense
of
not
presenting
sufficient
evidence
or
a
case
in
which
the
legal
arguments,
perhaps
because
they
were
not
as
fully
developed
in
the
lower
courts
have,
in
any
way,
prejudiced
the
other
side
in
this
court.
the
issues
are
fully
developed
and
they
are,
we
think,
legal
issues
and
i
acknowledge
it’s
an
unusual
situation.
unfortunately,
it’s
not
perhaps
the
first
time
that
the
federal
government
has
shifted
position
in
this
court,
but
we
think--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
not
a
happy
situation--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it’s
one
that
we
feel
it’s
our
obligation--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and,
of
course,
the
governmental
interest
involved
in
this
case,
also
the
interests
of
the
department
of
transportation
which
are
broader
perhaps
than
those
of
the
federal
aviation
administration.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
has
happened,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
say
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
stewart.
it’s
an
unhappy
situation,
but
one
i
think
that
is
inevitable
under
the
complicated
government
system
that
we
have
today.
now,
the
burbank
ordinance
in
this
case
reflects
an
exercise
of
traditional
police
power
of
the
states.
what’s
involved
here
basically,
by--
through
the
exercise
of
this
ordinance,
is
the
abatement
of
a
nuisance,
a
traditional
nuisance:
noise.
this
is
a--
the
usual
area
of
police
power.
the
state
has
the
authority
to
deal
with
noxious
odors,
with
unpleasant
sights,
and
little
loud
noises.
there’s
no
question
about
that,
and
this
court
itself
recognized
in
the
rice
case
in
331
us
that
when
you’re
dealing
with
the
traditional
power
of
the
state,
the
police
power,
to
deal
with
these
subjects,
that
power
is
superseded
by
federal
legislation
only
if
that
was
the
clear
and
manifest
purpose
of
congress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we--
our
position
is
that
the
airport
has
the
authority
to
control
all
noises
with
the
exception
that
it’s
the
control
power
of--
at
the
airport
it
has
no
power
to
control
flight
of
aircraft.
that
is
the
distinction
we--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think,
as
far
as
preemption
is
concerned,
just
as
far
as
preemption
is
concerned
i
would
think
that
the
state
would
have
the
authority
if
it
wished
to
prohibit
jet
flights
in
and
out
of
a
particular
airport.
to
answer
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
earlier,
i
would
think,
as
far
as
preemption
is
concerned,
and
i
would
stress
just
the
preemption
point,
that
there’s
nothing
in
the
regulatory
scheme
that
would
bar
the
city
of
burbank
from
prohibiting
all
jet
aircraft
using
the
flight.
indeed,
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
commerce
is
another
issue,
but
i’m
just
talking
about
preemption.
in
fact,
there’s
nothing
in
either
the
preemption
of
the
commerce
clause
that
would
prevent
the
burbank
airport
from
shutting
itself
down
if
it
wanted
to.
there
might
be
other
contract--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
our
position,
mr.
justice,
is
that,
under
the
statutes,
the
congress
has
not
thus
far
preempted
the
local
governmental
bodies
from
dealing
with
the
question
of
noise
at
the
airport
level.
this
is
our
position.
we
say
that
the
plenary
power
of
congress
over
interstate
commerce
is
broad
enough
to
enable
it
to
exercise
this
power.
we
acknowledge
that
congress
could,
if
it
wished,
say
there
shall
be
no
curfews
at
airports
or
that
there
shall
be
prescribed.
our
position
is
congress
hasn’t
done
it
and
that
the
legislative
scheme
indicates
that
while
it
has
left
great
responsibility
to
the
faa
in
this
area,
the
faa
itself
has
not
thus
far
undertaken
to
regulate
this.
now,
i--
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
distinction
between
the
airport
operator
as
a
proprietor
and
the
airport--
the
authority
of
the
local
government--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
respond
on
two
levels
to
this.
first,
this
is
true,
i
suppose,
in
any
case
where
the
state
undertakes
to
obey
the
nuisance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
factually,
yes.
in
fact,
we
suggest
that
that
fact
indicates
how
anomalous
it
would
be
if
congress--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
i
suggest,
mr.
justice,
the
question
is
whether
the
congress
has
manifested
an
intention
to
preempt
this
field
and,
under
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
effect
is
that
congress
has
preempted
only
basically
the
burbank
airport.
it
said
that,
as
far
as
burbank
is
concerned,
burbank
has
no
authority
to
impose
this
curfew.
as
far
as
the
los
angeles
international
airport,
20
miles
away,
a
much
larger
airport,
under
its
theory,
that
airport
does
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
curfew
because
it
is
the
proprietor.
now,
we
think--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s--
we
think,
mr.
justice,
that
when
the
various
committee
reports
referred
to
the
authority
of
the
airport
owner
of
local
municipal
body
as
the
proprietor
of
the
airport,
they
were
not
attempting
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
local
government
body
as
proprietor
of
the
airport
and
the
local
government
body
exercising
its
police
power.
we
think
that
all
of
these
statements
were
made
at
a
time
that
was
generally
regarded
that
generally
believes
that
the
airports
of
this
country,
the
major
airports,
were
being
used,
being
run
and
operated
by
local
governmental
bodies
and
this
was
just--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statements
talked
about
operators
of
airports,
but--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t,
in
all
fairness,
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice.
we
have
other
indications
to
the
contrary
in
the
legislative
history
of
this.
if
i
may
refer
to
an
item
at
page
29
of
our
brief
which
is
a
report
made
by
the
house
of
commerce
committee
in
1962
after
a
three-year
study
of
the
whole
problem
of
noise
at
airports
and
this
is
paragraph
7.03,
and
this
is
what
the
committee
says
“until
federal
action
is
taken,
the
local
governmental
authorities
must
be
deemed
to
possess
the
police
power
necessary
to
protect
their
citizens
and
property
from
the
unreasonable
invasion
of
aircraft
noise.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
so
far
as
the
question
of
preemption
is
concerned,
our
answer
is
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
may
be
a
problem
under
the
commerce
clause,
we
don’t
know.
there
may
be
a
problem
under
the
commerce
clause
because,
obviously,
the
impact
upon
commerce.
the
ban
on
jet
flights
at
night
from
the
los
angeles
airport
may
be
a
very
different
thing
than
the
ban
on
the
take
off
of
jet
flights
at
the
burbank
airport
where
the
record
shows
there
were
no
commercial
interstate
flights
at
all,
but
insofar
as
the
question
of
preemption
is
concerned,
yes,
we
think
there’s
nothing
in
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
that
would
bar
the
city
of
los
angeles
from
adopting
such
an
ordinance.
and
if
i
may
just
refer
to
one
other
thing,
mr.
yost
spoke
about
the
noise
control
act
of
1972.
in
addition
to
the
general
provisions
dealing
with
noise,
there’s
a
specific
provision
of
that
statute
relating
to
aircraft
noise,
and
one
of
the
things
that
this
statute
did
was
to
direct
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
make
a
study
and
report
to
commerce
within
nine
months
on
a
variety
of
topic
relating
to
aircraft
noise,
one
of
which
was
additional
measures
available
to
airport
operators
and
local
governments
to
control
airport
noise.
such
a
study
is
now
being
made.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
this
very
clearly
indicates
that
the
congress
that
passed
this
law
wanted
to
see
what
could
be
done
by
both
the
local
operators
and
by
the
local
governmental
authorities
to
deal
with
aircraft
noise,
and
it
seems
it
would
be
rather
anomalous,
we
think,
for
congress
on
the
one
hand
to
have
been
requesting
this
additional
information
to
see
how
we
could
implement
the
power
in
the
local
government
agencies
and,
at
the
same
time,
in
effect
to
be
saying
“but
we’ve
taken
away
from
the
local
government
authorities
any
power
to
deal
with
this.”
we
think
the
basic
thrust
of
all
of
this
legislative
history
is
that
there’s
nothing
in
this
act
to
indicate
that
congress
ever
intended
at
least
until
there’d
been
further
action
by
the
federal
government,
either
the
congress
or
the
faa,
to
bar
the
local
governmental
authorities
from
dealing
with
this
serious
and
difficult
problem
of
noise,
and
that’s
the
way
it
stands
and
we
think,
on
that
basis,
the
burbank
ordinance
has
not
been
preempted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
this--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
discussed
this
in
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
unfortunately,
with
the
limited
time
available
i
couldn’t
cover
it
but
our
answer--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
have
dealt
with
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
five
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
those
five
minutes.
the
critical
distinction,
we
think,
that
appears
in
this
legislation
in
terms
of
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
here
was
between
the
regulation
of
flying,
all
aspects
of
flying
which
we
think
has
been
preempted
by
the
federal
legislation
and
the
regulation
of
airports
which
is
not
the
comprehensive
regulation
as
a
regulation
of
the
airspace,
a
regulation
of
safety,
a
regulation
of
the
flight
of
aircraft.
but,
we
think
it
is
not
a
regulation
of
the
airport
itself.
now,
of
course,
things
that
happen
on
the
airport
are
related
to
flight.
obviously,
if
the
airport
refuses
to
build
an
additional
runway
that
is
necessary,
it’s
going
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
flight
to
take
place,
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
we
think
that
congress
was
referring
to
when
it
keeps
speaking
in
these
terms,
and
i’d
like
to
refer
specifically
to
the
letter
from
the
secretary
at
the
appendix
to
the
appellant’s
brief
which
mr.
christopher
referred
to.
what
the
court’s
letter
said
was
the
courts
have
held
that
the
fed--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
first
unnumbered
page
of
the
appendix
after
the
green-blue
slip
at
the
end.
the
courts
have
held
that
the
federal
government
presently
preempts
the
field
of
noise
regulation
insofar
as
it
involved
controlling
the
flight
of
aircraft,
and
then
the
next
sentence
they
cite
a
case
called
the
town
of
hempstead
which
was
just
that.
the
village
of
hempstead
attempted
to
control
the
flight
of
aircraft
in
and
out
of
kennedy
airport
by
saying
that
a
plane
could
not
fly
over
the
village
of
hempstead
if
it
emitted
noise
beyond
a
certain
level.
that’s
what
they
were
talking
about.
we
think
it’s
repeated
again
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph.
state
and
local
governments
will
remain
unable
to
use
their
police
powers
to
control
aircraft
noise
by
regulating
the
flight
of
aircrafts
and,
of
course,
that’s
precisely
what
the
preferential
runway
regulation
that’s
involved
in
this
case
attempts
to
do.
that
controls
the
flight
of
aircraft.
that
determines
how
a
plane
is
to
takeoff
in
which
direction.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that--
but
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
with
reference
to
an
ordinance
that
attempted
to
control
the
flight
of
aircraft.
what
hampstead
was
attempting
to
do
was
to
control
the
way
in
which
planes
landed
and
took
off
and
approached
the
kennedy
airport
by
saying
planes
which
make
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
noise
cannot
fly
over
our
city
and
that’s,
we
think,
what
congress
had
reference
to
when
it
spoke
of
controlling
the
flight
of
aircraft.
and,
we
think
the
whole
policy
that’s
reflected
in
this
congressional
debate
and
the
faa’s
consideration
of
it
is
the
recognition
that
when
you’re
dealing
with
such
things
as
whether
a
plane
should
or
shouldn’t
be
permitted
to
takeoff
from
an
airport,
that’s
a
matter
of
fundamental
local
policy.
there
are
conflicting
interests
involved.
on
the
one
hand,
the
interests
of
the
traveling
public
and
the
industry
in
the
area
of
getting
the
best
possible
air
service
obtainable.
on
the
other
hand,
there’s
an
equally
strong,
perhaps
a
greater,
interest
of
the
people,
the
interest
of
the
people
in
these
areas
of
being
able
to
get
a
good
night’s
sleep.
and,
this
is
the
kind
of
balancing
of
conveniences
that
traditionally
is
left
to
the
local
government
bodies
to
decide.
the
town
council
of
burbank
made
the
judgment
that
whatever
may
be
the
effects
of
this
on
air
service,
and
it
seems
quite
clear
it’s
minimal
here,
that
nevertheless
that
adverse
effect
was
more
than
outweighed
of
a--
by
the
benefits
to
the
people
in
this
surrounding
area
of
having
freedom
from
the
noise
when
they’re
trying
to
sleep.
now,
the
runway
preference
order,
i
might
add
one
other
thing
about
it,
that
there
is
no
authority.
the
faa
informs
us
and
an
air
tower
controller
to
impose
a
curfew.
the
only
thing
he
can
do
is
these
preference
runways.
the
preference
runways
are
not
mandatory.
page
444
of
the
record
which
contains
the
text
of
the
pro--
the
order,
the
second
full
sentence
in
that
paragraph
is
saying
the
procedures
are
not
mandatory
on
the
part
of
the
pilots.
however,
traffic
controllers
must
be
noise
abate
and
conscious
and
emphasize
noise
abatement
to
obtain
the
highest
degree
of
voluntary
cooperation
from
pilots.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say,
most
clearly
not,
mr.
justice.
hampstead
could
not
do
that.
that
would
be
a
regulation
flight.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
flying
over
hampstead.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
hampstead--
if
there
were
an
airport
within
the
city
of
hampstead,
hampstead
could
say
no
plane
could
takeoff
from
that
airport
between
the
hours
of
11
and
7.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
far
as
the
federal
aviation
act
is
concerned,
yes,
mr.
justice.
that
might
present
a
different
commerce
problem
at
kennedy
than
it
presents
in
burbank,
but
as
far--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
kennedy
has
many
flights
but,
mr.
justice,
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
commerce,
it
seems
to
us,
it
does
make
a
substantial
difference
whether
you’re
dealing
with
a
little
airport
like
burbank
which
has
no
commercially
scheduled
flights
in--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
respect
to
preemption,
yes.
that
is,
if
i
may
restate
it,
as
far
as
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
is
concerned,
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
does
not
operate
to
prevent
an
aircraft--
to
prevent
an
airport
from
being
told
it
cannot
take--
permit
certain
noisy
things
at
the
airport
as
distinguished
from
the
actual
commencement
of
the
flight.
once
the
plane
is
on
the
runway
and
starts
to
takeoff
even
though
that’s
in
the
airport,
that’s
an
integral
part
of
the
flight.
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
flight,
and
that
is
preempted,
and
all
that
we’re
saying
is
it
is
not
preempted
now,
at
least
thus
far.
congress
has
not
attempted
to
take
over
the
regulation
of
airports.
congress
could
do
it.
under
its
broad
power
of
interstate
commerce,
commerce
could
do
it,
either
itself
directly
or
congress
could
do
it
acting
through
the
faa
and
maybe
someday
it
will
do
it.
the
matter
is
understudied.
maybe
a
year
from
now,
the
faa
will
conclude
either
that
there
should
be
a
ban
on
curfews
or
decide
to
put
in
curfews.
our
point
is
that
unless
and
until
congress
affirmatively
does
that,
unless
that
happens,
this
matter
is
within
the
control
and
authority
of
the
local
police
power.
thank
you.
