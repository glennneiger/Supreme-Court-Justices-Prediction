justice

stewart
mr.
sieg,
that
right
of
privacy,
if
it
was
mentioned
in
those
cases,
was
a
right
against
governmental
action,
weren’t
they?
where
an
airplane
takes
off
owned
by
a
private
carrier,
that’s
not
the
government
invading
anybody’s
right
of
privacy,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
have
a
little
problem
seeing
why
an
executive
jet,
by
a
private
company
takes
off,
how
that’s
governmental
action
because
that’s
what’s
the--
the
noise
from
that
jet
owned
by
the
xyz
corporation
that
invades
which
you
call
a
right
of
privacy,
and
that’s
not
government
invading
the
right
of
privacy,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
freedom.
it’s
a
freedom
that
government
could
not
invade.
justice
potter
stewart
but--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
invasion
is
by
a
private
corporation,
not
by
government.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
going
way,
way
beyond
the
issues
in
this
case,
isn’t
it,
at
least
your
arguments
you’re
now
making?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
yost,
as
i
--
as
i
have
understood
your
argument,
it’s
directed
to
the
appellees’
claim
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
preemption
and
the
specific
conflict
between
federal
and
state,
and
federal
and
local
law
which
was
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
tried
at
this
case.
your
argument
is
not
directed
at
all,
is
it,
to
the
claim
that
this
ordinance
has
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
nothing
in
those
enactments,
is
there,
that
authorizes
what
would
otherwise
be
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
argue,
i
suppose,
that
the
necessary
implication
of
the
legislation
is,
but
i
don’t--
you
haven’t
argued
that,
have
you
really?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
it
is
a
separate
issue.
it’s
a
separate
constitutional
question.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
argument
has
been
directed,
has
it
not,
of
this
primarily
to
the
preemption
and
the
conflict
aspects
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
argue
that
congress
have
authorized
local
government
to
impose
what
would
otherwise
be
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
and
since
the
congressional
power
is
plenary
over
interstate
commerce,
presumably
it
has
complete
power
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
your
amicus
below
or
the
faa--
justice
potter
stewart
because,
certainly,
i
would
imply
no
criticism
in
this
question
because,
paraphrase
to
justice
frankfurter,
you--
one
should
welcome
wisdom
even
though
it
comes
late,
but
it
does
kind
of--
this
rather
is
alien
to
the
adversary
system
of
justice,
isn’t
it?
it’s
a
little
bit
unfair
to
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and,
ultimately,
to
this
court
to
have
a
very
influential
amicus
and
certainly
with
the
expertise
of
the
agency
it
is
to
completely
change
positions
in
the
course
of
litigation.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
saying
i’m
not
being
grateful
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
end
result
is,
perhaps,
that
the--
it’s
a
little
bit
unfair
to
the
whole
judicial
adversary
system.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
amounts
to
100%
confession
of
error
on
the
part
of
the
amicus.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
stating
that’s
what
it
is.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
except
not--
but
not
in
the
district
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
never
a
happy--
justice
potter
stewart
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
practical
impact,
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
talking--
we’re
mixing
up
two
very
important
things,
and
that
is
the
right
of
an
airport
to
shut
itself
down
or
to
limit
the
hours
of
flights
or
to
limit
all
jets.
the
right
of
an
airport
owner
and
operator
to
do
that
is
one
thing,
and
it
may
be
quite
a
different
right
from
what
the
right
of
a
municipality
has
to
tell
an
unwilling
airport
operator
you
have
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it’s--
as
i
read
the
briefs
and
the
statutes
and
the
legislative
history,
there
may
be
a
considerable
difference
between
those
two
things.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
here--
the
point
is,
here,
the
airport
operator
does
not
want
this
curfew.
he’s
being
compelled
to
do
it,
and
that’s
a
great
big
difference
from
all
that
you’ll
find
in
the
legislative
history
of
his
right
to
have
a
curfew
when
he
wants
one.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except--
as
i
again
read
the
facts
of
the
matter,
99.5%
of
the
airports
in
the
country
are
operated
by
governmental
agencies.
so
this--
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
question
doesn’t
arise.
if
the
governmental
agency
wants
to
impose
a
curfew,
it
does
so.
justice
potter
stewart
here’s
a
private
commercial
airport--
justice
potter
stewart
a
private
airport--
justice
potter
stewart
privately
owned,
serving
scheduled
airlines
which
is
almost
unique.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
factually?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
it
would
be.
there
are
lots
of
things
in
the
law
that
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that’s
what
the
law
is.
that’s
what
they
held.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
statements
talked
about
operators
of
airports,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
theory
was
that
the
owner
and
operator
of
an
airport,
that’s
his
property
and
he
can
do
with
it
of
how
he
wishes.
wasn’t
that
the
theory
that
you
find
recurring
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you--
you,
too,
have
not
really
addressed,
except
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell,
but
your
basic
argument
has
not
addressed
the
claim
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
brief,
i
know
you
say
that
you--
justice
potter
stewart
you
studied
airport
by
airport.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understood
your
argument.
it
is
not
directed
to
that
question
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
so
far,
everything
you’ve
told
us
is
really
what
the
ships
and
the
personnel
had
to
have
in
the
huron
portland
cement.
is
that
correct?
ships
had
to
be
licensed,
so
did
the
crews
and
they
had
to
follow
the
coastguard
safety
patterns
on.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that’s
what
an
airworthiness
certificate
is
directed
to,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that--
that
letter
is
printed
i
guess
in
several
places
in
the
brief.
can
you
just
tell
me
one
place
in
one
of
the
briefs?
justice
potter
stewart
government’s
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
quite
a
few
briefs
in
this
case,
didn’t
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
however--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
this
was
a
letter
from
the
secretary,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
secretary
was
over
there
testifying
and
then
he
remembered
he--
justice
potter
stewart
he
went
on.
he
then
asked
permission
to
file
a
letter,
and
this
was
the
letter.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
letter,
you
say,
was
adopted
in
the
committee
report.
justice
potter
stewart
as
its
own.
justice
potter
stewart
this
doesn’t
become
a
very
important
case
then
if
that’s
the
distinction.
it
doesn’t
because
there’s
at
least,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
briefs,
this
is
perhaps
the
only
airport
in
the
whole
united
states
that’s
privately
owned
and
that
serves
scheduled
air
carriers.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
kentucky
can
pass
along
to
the
cincinnati
airport.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
it’s
on
the
kentucky
side.
the
greater
cincinnati
airport
is
on
the
kentucky
side.
that’s
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
then
do
i
understand
you
to
be
saying,
mr.
christopher,
conceding
that
if
your
client,
the
owner-operator
of
the
airport
which
is
the
what,
lockheed
corporation
or
the
city--
justice
potter
stewart
if
your
client
wanted
to
impose
this
curfew,
it
could
freely
do
so
without
running
into
any
problems
of
either
preemption
or
conflict?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
talking
about
preemption
or
conflict.
as
i
understood
your
argument,
you
said
that
the
legislative
history
in
the
statute
showed
that
the
owner-operator,
so
far
as
preemption
and
conflict
with
federal
law
go,
could
freely
do
this.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
no
such--
justice
potter
stewart
in
either
in
this
case
or
anywhere
else
i
see
in
the
briefs.
i
thought
that
the
whole
idea
was
that,
as
developed
in
your
brief
and
in
the
port
of
new
york
authority’s
brief
and
so
on
was
that
airport
operators,
under
the
law,
were--
and
under
the
regulations
were
kept
free
to
do
what
they
want
with
the
airports.
justice
potter
stewart
you
point
out,
if
under
the
law
the
airport
proprietor
is
liable
to
adjoining
property
owners
for
under
the
cases
of
this
court,
he
certainly
should
have
the
commencery
power
to
seize
the
conduct
that
would
the
liabilities,
isn’t
it
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
you
said
this
and
i
didn’t
hear
it
because
i
wasn’t
attentive.
has
the
faa
itself,
on
any
privately
owned
and
operated
airport,
imposed
any
absolute
restrictions
on
nighttime
takeoffs
or
landings?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that,
apparently,
in
your
submission,
not
even
a
curfew.
it’s
a
voluntary
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you--
i
suppose
you
not
only
would
concede
but
would
insist
on
the
power
of
the
faa
to
do
this
if
it
wanted
to,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
are
many
small
airports,
are
there
not
still,
that
cannot
be
and
are
not
operated
at
night
for
safety
reasons?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
basically
relies
on
the
inevitable
interrelationship
of
the
airports
around
the
country
because
of
speed
and
time
and
you
suddenly
can’t
takeoff
from
the
west
coast
then
it
can’t
takeoff
from
somewhere
else
during
the
daytime,
and
so
on.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
basic
interrelationship?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
a
case
that
massachusetts--
an
opinion
of
the
justices
having
to
do
with
proposed
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
the--
the
court
advised--
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
unconstitutional
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
bibb
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
helps
you
in
this
aspect
of
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
all
the
state
full
crew
laws?
you
know
the
cases
i’m
talking
about--
justice
potter
stewart
you
mentioned
by
name,
i
don’t--
justice
potter
stewart
but
wasn’t
there
some
reliance
in
the
opinions
in
those
cases
upon
the
fact
that
neither
congress
nor
the
commission
had
acted
in
the
area?
justice
potter
stewart
no
flying?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
there
shall
be
no
flying?
justice
potter
stewart
neither
is
this.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
not
a
regulation
of
flying.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sieg,
that
right
of
privacy,
if
it
was
mentioned
in
those
cases,
was
a
right
against
governmental
action,
weren’t
they?
where
an
airplane
takes
off
owned
by
a
private
carrier,
that’s
not
the
government
invading
anybody’s
right
of
privacy,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
have
a
little
problem
seeing
why
an
executive
jet,
by
a
private
company
takes
off,
how
that’s
governmental
action
because
that’s
what’s
the--
the
noise
from
that
jet
owned
by
the
xyz
corporation
that
invades
which
you
call
a
right
of
privacy,
and
that’s
not
government
invading
the
right
of
privacy,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
freedom.
it’s
a
freedom
that
government
could
not
invade.
justice
potter
stewart
but--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
invasion
is
by
a
private
corporation,
not
by
government.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
going
way,
way
beyond
the
issues
in
this
case,
isn’t
it,
at
least
your
arguments
you’re
now
making?

it’s
a

and
your

has
been

has
it
not,
of
this
primarily
to

of
the
airports
in
the
country
are
operated
by
governmental
agencies.
so
this--
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
question
doesn’t
arise.
if
the
governmental
agency
wants
to
impose
a
curfew,
it
does
so.
justice
potter
stewart
here’s
a
private
commercial
airport--
justice
potter
stewart
a
private
airport--
justice
potter
stewart
privately
owned,
serving
scheduled
airlines
which
is
almost
unique.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
factually?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
it
would
be.
there
are
lots
of
things
in
the
law
that
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that’s
what
the
law
is.
that’s
what
they
held.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
statements
talked
about
operators
of
airports,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
theory
was
that
the
owner
and
operator
of
an
airport,
that’s
his
property
and
he
can
do
with
it
of
how
he
wishes.
wasn’t
that
the
theory
that
you
find
recurring
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you--
you,
too,
have
not
really
addressed,
except
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell,
but
your
basic
argument
has
not
addressed
the
claim
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
brief,
i
know
you
say
that
you--
justice
potter
stewart
you
studied
airport
by
airport.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understood
your
argument.
it
is
not
directed
to
that
question
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
so
far,
everything
you’ve
told
us
is
really
what
the
ships
and
the
personnel
had
to
have
in
the
huron
portland
cement.
is
that
correct?
ships
had
to
be
licensed,
so
did
the
crews
and
they
had
to
follow
the
coastguard
safety
patterns
on.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that’s
what
an
airworthiness
certificate
is
directed
to,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that--
that
letter
is
printed
i
guess
in
several
places
in
the
brief.
can
you
just
tell
me
one
place
in
one
of
the
briefs?
justice
potter
stewart
government’s
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
quite
a
few
briefs
in
this
case,
didn’t
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
however--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
this
was
a
letter
from
the
secretary,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
secretary
was
over
there
testifying
and
then
he
remembered
he--
justice
potter
stewart
he
went
on.
he
then
asked
permission
to
file
a
letter,
and
this
was
the
letter.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
letter,
you
say,
was
adopted
in
the
committee
report.
justice
potter
stewart
as
its
own.
justice
potter
stewart
this
doesn’t
become
a
very
important
case
then
if
that’s
the
distinction.
it
doesn’t
because
there’s
at
least,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
briefs,
this
is
perhaps
the
only
airport
in
the
whole
united
states
that’s
privately
owned
and
that
serves
scheduled
air
carriers.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
kentucky
can
pass
along
to
the
cincinnati
airport.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
it’s
on
the
kentucky
side.
the
greater
cincinnati
airport
is
on
the
kentucky
side.
that’s
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
then
do
i
understand
you
to
be
saying,
mr.
christopher,
conceding
that
if
your
client,
the
owner-operator
of
the
airport
which
is
the
what,
lockheed
corporation
or
the
city--
justice
potter
stewart
if
your
client
wanted
to
impose
this
curfew,
it
could
freely
do
so
without
running
into
any
problems
of
either
preemption
or
conflict?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
talking
about
preemption
or
conflict.
as
i
understood
your
argument,
you
said
that
the
legislative
history
in
the
statute
showed
that
the
owner-operator,
so
far
as
preemption
and
conflict
with
federal
law
go,
could
freely
do
this.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
no
such--
justice
potter
stewart
in
either
in
this
case
or
anywhere
else
i
see
in
the
briefs.
i
thought
that
the
whole
idea
was
that,
as
developed
in
your
brief
and
in
the
port
of
new
york
authority’s
brief
and
so
on
was
that
airport
operators,
under
the
law,
were--
and
under
the
regulations
were
kept
free
to
do
what
they
want
with
the
airports.
justice
potter
stewart
you
point
out,
if
under
the
law
the
airport
proprietor
is
liable
to
adjoining
property
owners
for
under
the
cases
of
this
court,
he
certainly
should
have
the
commencery
power
to
seize
the
conduct
that
would
the
liabilities,
isn’t
it
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
you
said
this
and
i
didn’t
hear
it
because
i
wasn’t
attentive.
has
the
faa
itself,
on
any
privately
owned
and
operated
airport,
imposed
any
absolute
restrictions
on
nighttime
takeoffs
or
landings?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that,
apparently,
in
your
submission,
not
even
a
curfew.
it’s
a
voluntary
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you--
i
suppose
you
not
only
would
concede
but
would
insist
on
the
power
of
the
faa
to
do
this
if
it
wanted
to,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
are
many
small
airports,
are
there
not
still,
that
cannot
be
and
are
not
operated
at
night
for
safety
reasons?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
basically
relies
on
the
inevitable
interrelationship
of
the
airports
around
the
country
because
of
speed
and
time
and
you
suddenly
can’t
takeoff
from
the
west
coast
then
it
can’t
takeoff
from
somewhere
else
during
the
daytime,
and
so
on.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
basic
interrelationship?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
a
case
that
massachusetts--
an
opinion
of
the
justices
having
to
do
with
proposed
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
the--
the
court
advised--
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
unconstitutional
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
bibb
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
helps
you
in
this
aspect
of
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
all
the
state
full
crew
laws?
you
know
the
cases
i’m
talking
about--
justice
potter
stewart
you
mentioned
by
name,
i
don’t--
justice
potter
stewart
but
wasn’t
there
some
reliance
in
the
opinions
in
those
cases
upon
the
fact
that
neither
congress
nor
the
commission
had
acted
in
the
area?
justice
potter
stewart
no
flying?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
there
shall
be
no
flying?
justice
potter
stewart
neither
is
this.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
not
a
regulation
of
flying.
