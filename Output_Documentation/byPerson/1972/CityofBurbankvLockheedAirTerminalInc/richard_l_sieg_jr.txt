mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
of
this
case
is
an
airport,
a
privately
owned
and
operated
airport
in
a
thickly
populated
area
and
almost
entirely
within
the
city
or
burbank.
the
problem
with
respect
to
this
airport
began
in
approximately
1965
when
jet
aircraft
began
using
this
airport
on
a
regular
basis.
as
jet
traffic
increased,
the
problem
became
more
serious.
the
problem
was
first
officially
noted
by
the
faa
tower
chief
of
this
in
1967
when
he
issued
the
first
of
a
series
of
four
runway
abatement
preference.
he
noted
at
the
time
that
the
problem
in
the
vicinity
of
airports
had
become
increasingly
serious
and
that
if
the
problem
could
not
be
resolved,
it
might
be
necessary
to
close
runways
and
even
entire
airport.
after
this,
he
issued
three
other
indifferent
runway
preference
orders.
none
of
these
provided
any
substantial
relief.
the
last
of
these
orders
was
issued
in
september
of
1969.
thereafter,
the
council
of
the
city
of
burbank
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
in
march
of
1970,
adopted
the
ordinance
which
is
before
the
court.
the
ordinance
makes
it
unlawful
for
the
operator
of
the
hollywood
burbank
airport
to
allow
a
pure
jet
aircraft
to
take
off
between
the
hours
of
11
p.m.
and
7
a.m.,
except
in
emergencies.
the
same
prohibition
is
applied
to
the
pilots
of
these
aircrafts.
as
noted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision,
the
expressed
purpose
of
the
ordinance
was
to
abate
the
serious
environmental
problem
caused
by
the
taking
off
of
jet
aircraft
during
sleeping
hours.
as
found
by
the
trial
court,
the
ordinance
interfered
with
one
sunday
night
intrastate
flight,
and
with
flights
of
jet
aircraft
of
at
least
three
per
week.
some
of
those
who
had
filed
their
briefs
in
this
case
have
mistakenly
used
a
figure
of
60
per
month
as
a
number
of
corporate
jet
flights
interfered
with
by
the
ordinance.
this
is
the
--
this
number
60
is
a
total
number
of
jet
--
corporate
jet
aircraft
flights
during
nighttime
hours,
as
testified
too
by
the
president
of
lockheed.
he
was
unable
to
state
how
many
of
these
flights
occurred
during
the
proscribed
hours.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
i
assume
it
was
irregular,
but
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
did
not
go
into
that
in
any
detail.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
yes,
the
testimony
as
it
found
in
the
record
refers
to
the
fact
that
60
aircrafts,
corporate
jet
aircraft,
took
off
during
the
nighttime
hours,
and
that
word
was
specifically
used,
and
i
followed
that
answer
with
a
question
as
to
how
many
of
these
occurred
during
the
proscribed
hours
and
the
president
of
lockheed
was
unable
to
state
how
many.
he
first
said
maybe
half
and
then
he
had
to
state
that
he
couldn’t
testify
to
that
fact.
may
i
continue,
your
honor?
the
evidence
in
this
case
established
that
airports,
whether
publicly
or
privately
owned,
had
not
been
brought
into
the
orbit
of
federal
control
with
one
exception.
the
exception
is
found
in
section
612
of
the
federal
aviation
act
of
1958,
which
was
adopted
in
1970
and
became
effective
after
the
trial
of
this
case
on
may
27,
1972.
that
section
is
very
peculiarly
worded.
it
provides
that
any
person
who
desires
to
serve
air
carriers,
the
word
“desires”
is
used
in
the
section,
air
carriers
certificated
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
may
apply
for
an
airport
operating
certificate.
the
section
further
provides
that
the
federal
aviation
administrator
must
issue
such
a
certificate
if
he
finds
that
the
person
is
able
to
conduct
a
safe
operation.
that
is
all.
the
administrator
may
attach
conditions
to
these
certificates
that
further
this
particular
end,
that
is,
a
safe
operation.
section
611
of
the
federal
aviation
act
of
1958,
which
played
a
prominent
part
in
this
case,
was
added
in
1968.
it
confers
on
the
federal
aviation
administrator
the
power
to
issue
such
rules
and
regulations
as
he
may
find
necessary
to
provide
for
the
control
and
abatement
of
aircraft
noise
and
sonic
boom.
if
this
section
conferred
on
the
administrator
the
power
to
regulate
airports
in
terms
of
noise,
he
has
specifically
refrained
from
so
doing
and
has
repeatedly
affirmed
the
freedom
of
airport
proprietors
to
exclude
aircraft
from
their
airports
on
the
basis
of
noise
considerations.
the
district
court,
in
its
decision,
held
the
ordinance
to
be
invalid
on
the
ground
of
preemption,
conflict,
and
the
unreasonable
burden
which
the
ordinance
would
have
if
it
were
applied
to
all
major
airports
throughout
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
decision,
did
not
reach
the
commerce
clause
issue
and
restricted
its
decision
to
the
supremacy
clause
matters.
it
held,
the
ordinance
to
be
repugnant
to
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
on
the
ground
of
preemption
and
also
on
the
ground
of
conflict.
the
conflict
issue,
it
cited,
at
last
of
the
faa
tower
chief’s
noise
abatement
runway
procedures
and
also
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
interfered
with
the
sunday
night
intrastate
flight
of
psa.
the
court
of
appeals
broadly
held
in
its
decision
that
the
pervasiveness
of
the
federal
regulation
in
the
field
of
air
commerce,
the
national
interest
in
such
regulation,
and
the
nature
of
air
commerce
itself
precluded
states
and
local
governments
from
enacting
this
type
of
regulation.
the
district
court
in
its
decision,
holding
that
the
ordinance
had
to
be
viewed
in
the
aspect
as
if
it
were
applied
to
all
major
airports
in
the
united
states.
it
was
a
holding
along
with
the
broad
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
made
it
necessary
that
we
apply
to
this
court
for
hearing.
the
ordinance
comes
before
this
court
with
the
presumption
that
it
was
reasonable
and
necessary.
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
demonstrated
the
airport’s
inadequacies.
the
airport
is
simply
not
operable
without
being
used
of
adjacent
private
property
for
its
approach
ways
and
its
takeoffs.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
noted
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
that
the
airport
created
to
those
that
resided
in
its
vicinity.
this
problem
was
further
underscored
by
the
various
statements
made
by
the
faa
tower
chief
in
these
various
noise
abatement
runway
procedures.
he
stated,
for
example,
that
the
area
within
5
miles
of
the
airport
was
noise
sensitive.
he
made
further
reference
to
the
numerous
complaints,
the
possible
result
of
requiring
the
closing
down
of
runways
and
entire
airports.
this
brings
me
to
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on.
it
is
against
the
background
that
i’ve
just
stated
that
we
asserted
in
our
brief
that
the
commerce
clause
cannot
shield
those
who
invade
fifth
amendment
rights,
and
that
legislation,
such
as
the
burbank
ordinance,
must
be
sustained
if
that
amendment
is
to
have
any
real
meaning.
we
pursue
this
especially
in
view
of
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
roe
versus
wade.
by
that
decision,
it
is
now
firmly
established
that
a
right
of
privacy
exists
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
is
no
specific
mention
of
this
right
in
the
constitution.
as
we
understand
the
court’s
opinion,
this
fundamental
right
is
founded
on
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
concept
of
personal
liberty
and
restriction
on
state
action.
if
this
be
so,
then
the
same
right
of
privacy
must
exist
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
a
restriction
on
the
powers
of
the
federal
government.
this
decision
along
with
griswold
versus
connecticut,
in
our
view,
gives
form
and
substance
to
the
belief
of
the
signers
of
the
declaration
of
independence
that
certain
unalienable
rights
existed,
including
the
right
to
life,
liberty,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
it
is,
in
this
respect.
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
is
correct
in
holding
that
the
federal
government
has
preempted
the
rights
of
states
and
local
governments
and
the
people
from
doing
something
about
this
invasion
into
their
right
of
privacy,
then
we
feel
that
this
particular
decision
is
most
important
and
is
applicable
as
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
what
i’m
trying
to
get
to
is
that
a
declaration
of
preemption,
whether
it
be
by
congress
or
by
the
court,
which
leaves
unprotected
fundamental
rights
of
the
people
such
as
are
involved
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
and
the
declaration--
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
the
invasion
of
a
declaration
of
preemption
is
by
the
government,
the
federal
government.
if
it
leaves
fundamental
rights
unprotected,
it
is,
in
our
view,
impermissible.
let
me
pursue
it
just
a
little
further
and
maybe
i
can
more
appropriately
demonstrate
what
i’m
driving
at.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
that’s
the
governmental
action,
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
to
you--
now,
i
recognize
in
roe
versus
wade
we
have
a
certain
right
of
privacy.
that
is
not
exactly
comparable
to
the
right
of
privacy
that
we
feel
is
involved
here.
what
we
say
is
that
the
right
of
privacy
involved
in
this
case
is
based
on
the
same
principle
of
personal
liberty
and
based
on
the
same
considerations.
noise
pollution,
as
we
see
it,
whatever
its
form,
impinges
on
the
right
to
be
let
alone
and
invades
the
right
of
privacy.
it
disturbs
thought
and
contemplation.
it
intrudes
into
the
home,
interfering
with
family-like
conversation
and
sleep.
it
has
other
more
drastic
side
effects
such
as
hearing
loss
and
irritation
which,
if
long
continued,
can
distinct--
can
interfere
with
man’s
ability
to
deal
with
other
aspects
of
his
environment.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
i
have
indicated
something
along
that
line
in
my
brief,
and
i
thought
it
best
since
i
had
this
problem
of
presentation
that
i
restrict
myself
to
noise
pollution
because
noise
pollution
does
invade
the
right
of
privacy.
i
would
believe
until
this
court
enunciates
a
further
unenumerated
right
existing
in
the
constitution,
i
have
been
going
beyond
the
scope
of
my
endeavor
here
to
have
gotten
into
those
areas.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
if
it
produced
the
volume
and
the
effects
of
jet
aircraft,
yes,
but
i--
there
is
no
proper
comparison
between
the
two.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
i
was
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
if
it
produced--
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
if
it
produced
the
same
kind
of
problem
that
the
jet
engine
in
an
aircraft
produces,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
not
if
the
rule
that
i
hope
to
present
to
the
court
is
adopted
by
the
court.
i
feel,
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
indicated,
that
this
is
a
declaration
of
im--
a
preemption
is
impermissible
when
it
leaves
unprotected
fundamental
rights,
whatever
they
may
be.
if
it’s
water
pollution,
if
it’s
air
pollution,
noise
pollution,
or
whatever
may
affect--
substantially
affect
the
health
and
safety
of
people
but
that,
of
course,
is
going
beyond
what
i
intended
to
argue
in
this
matter.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
not--
no,
sir.
i--
no,
sir.
if
preemption
isn’t
involved,
obviously,
the
ordinance
is
valid.
it
is
valid
anyway
on
the
grounds
that
we’ve
argued
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
federal
preemption,
no
conflict.
but,
as
we
view
the
matter,
there
are
able
to--
the
rights
reserved
to
the
people
can
be
protected
by
any
level
of
government.
it’s
not
in
the
exclusive
power
of
the
federal
government
to
protect
those
rights.
the
people
have
many
means.
the
courts,
of
course,
are
the
primary
right,
and
the
primary
method,
at
least
in
this
century,
of
indicating
fundamental
rights,
especially
civil
rights.
we’re
dealing
in
this
case
with
human
rights,
and
we
need
some
rule
that
allows
action
by
the
people
trough
whatever
governmental
body
will
listen
to
them
to
protect
these
rights
reasonably.
we
do
not
contend
in
this
case
that
the
fundamental
right
of
privacy
involved
here
is
absolute.
we
say
that
the
right
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
its
effect,
and
there
has
to
be
a
balancing.
that
is,
that
the
people
is
entitled
to
all
reasonable
and
necessary
protection,
not
absolute
protection.
the
balancing
that
we
feel
is
proper
is
somewhat
along
the
lines
suggested
in
southern
pacific
versus
arizona.
the
extent
of
the
intrusion
should
be
weighed
against
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
and
if
the
enactment,
the
ordinance,
or
the
state
law,
or
whatever
it
may
be
provides
substantial
and
necessary
relief,
it
should
have
a
greater
weight
in
the
balancing.
i
might
add
that
the
court
may
recall,
and
again
i’m
striking
at
this
doctrine
of
preemption
and
conflict,
but
the
first
four--
the
first
two
of
the
grievances
that
are
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
independence
against
the
king
of
great
britain
were
these
two.
he
has
refused
his
assent
to
loss
the
most
wholesome
and
most
necessary
for
the
public
good.
he
has
forbidden
his
governors
to
pass
laws
of
immediate
and
pressing
importance
unless
suspended
on
their
operation
‘til
his
assent
should
be
obtained.
the
similarity
between
these
grievances
and
the
grievances
that
are
set
forth
in
the
declarations
of
preemption
contained
in
the
more
recent
congressional
enactments,
especially
the
noise
control
act
of
1972,
are
worthy
of
note.
we
submit,
as
a
proposition
worthy
of
this
court’s
consideration,
that
a
congressional
declaration
of
preemption
cannot
be
considered
a
rightful
exercise
of
legislative
authority
where,
in
that
effect,
is
to
leave
fundamental
rights
of
the
people
unprotected.
what
we’re
really
saying
is
the
application
here
of
the
dormant
and
unexercised
power
rule
that
is
set
forth
in
head
and
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission.
even
though
there
is
expressed
or
implied
congressional
declaration
of
preemption,
the
country
has
to
have
it.
when
you
observe
that
for
more
than
10
years,
some-7
odd
million
people
of
the
united
states
has
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
air
commerce
with
the
only
remedy
afforded,
if
you
can
call
it
a
remedy,
is
a
right
to
seek
damages,
if
they
own
the
property
on
which
they
reside,
as
against
the
airport
proprietor.
this,
to
us,
is
contrary
to
the
fundamental
rights
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution.
we
equally
feel
that
the
time
has
come
for
the
courts
to
take
a
direct
hand
in
this
matter.
the
solicitor
general
affirms
in
his
brief,
and
i
assume
he
will
argue
accordingly,
that
states
and
local
governments,
whether
they
are
proprietors
or
non-proprietors,
can
enact
reasonable
regulations
to
control
the
noise
problem
in
connection
with
airports
within
their
jurisdiction.
but,
suppose
the
governmental
entity,
having
jurisdiction,
refuses
or
fails
to
give
the
residents
in
their
vicinity
appropriate
and
necessary
relief,
only
the
courts
are
then
available.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
problem
has
escalated
to
such
a
point
that
the
lower
federal
courts
should
take
a
hand
in
the
matter
and,
if
necessary,
require
from
these
airport
proprietors
the
summation
of
plans
which
will
eventually
reduce
the
problem
of
noise
to
levels
which
the
people
can
stand.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
it
is
only--
yes,
it
is.
i
simply
put
it
as
another
possibility.
what
we
need
is
a
solution.
that’s
what
i’m
trying
to
say.
the
burbank
ordinance
provides
a
solution
for
a
very
limited
group
of
circumstance.
that
is
just
what
i’m
saying.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
of
this
case
is
an
airport,
a
privately
owned
and
operated
airport
in
a
thickly
populated
area
and
almost
entirely
within
the
city
or
burbank.
the
problem
with
respect
to
this
airport
began
in
approximately
1965
when
jet
aircraft
began
using
this
airport
on
a
regular
basis.
as
jet
traffic
increased,
the
problem
became
more
serious.
the
problem
was
first
officially
noted
by
the
faa
tower
chief
of
this
in
1967
when
he
issued
the
first
of
a
series
of
four
runway
abatement
preference.
he
noted
at
the
time
that
the
problem
in
the
vicinity
of
airports
had
become
increasingly
serious
and
that
if
the
problem
could
not
be
resolved,
it
might
be
necessary
to
close
runways
and
even
entire
airport.
after
this,
he
issued
three
other
indifferent
runway
preference
orders.
none
of
these
provided
any
substantial
relief.
the
last
of
these
orders
was
issued
in
september
of
1969.
thereafter,
the
council
of
the
city
of
burbank
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
in
march
of
1970,
adopted
the
ordinance
which
is
before
the
court.
the
ordinance
makes
it
unlawful
for
the
operator
of
the
hollywood
burbank
airport
to
allow
a
pure
jet
aircraft
to
take
off
between
the
hours
of
11
p.m.
and
7
a.m.,
except
in
emergencies.
the
same
prohibition
is
applied
to
the
pilots
of
these
aircrafts.
as
noted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision,
the
expressed
purpose
of
the
ordinance
was
to
abate
the
serious
environmental
problem
caused
by
the
taking
off
of
jet
aircraft
during
sleeping
hours.
as
found
by
the
trial
court,
the
ordinance
interfered
with
one
sunday
night
intrastate
flight,
and
with
flights
of
jet
aircraft
of
at
least
three
per
week.
some
of
those
who
had
filed
their
briefs
in
this
case
have
mistakenly
used
a
figure
of
60
per
month
as
a
number
of
corporate
jet
flights
interfered
with
by
the
ordinance.
this
is
the
--
this
number
60
is
a
total
number
of
jet
--
corporate
jet
aircraft
flights
during
nighttime
hours,
as
testified
too
by
the
president
of
lockheed.
he
was
unable
to
state
how
many
of
these
flights
occurred
during
the
proscribed
hours.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
i
assume
it
was
irregular,
but
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
did
not
go
into
that
in
any
detail.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
yes,
the
testimony
as
it
found
in
the
record
refers
to
the
fact
that
60
aircrafts,
corporate
jet
aircraft,
took
off
during
the
nighttime
hours,
and
that
word
was
specifically
used,
and
i
followed
that
answer
with
a
question
as
to
how
many
of
these
occurred
during
the
proscribed
hours
and
the
president
of
lockheed
was
unable
to
state
how
many.
he
first
said
maybe
half
and
then
he
had
to
state
that
he
couldn’t
testify
to
that
fact.
may
i
continue,
your
honor?
the
evidence
in
this
case
established
that
airports,
whether
publicly
or
privately
owned,
had
not
been
brought
into
the
orbit
of
federal
control
with
one
exception.
the
exception
is
found
in
section
612
of
the
federal
aviation
act
of
1958,
which
was
adopted
in
1970
and
became
effective
after
the
trial
of
this
case
on
may
27,
1972.
that
section
is
very
peculiarly
worded.
it
provides
that
any
person
who
desires
to
serve
air
carriers,
the
word
“desires”
is
used
in
the
section,
air
carriers
certificated
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
may
apply
for
an
airport
operating
certificate.
the
section
further
provides
that
the
federal
aviation
administrator
must
issue
such
a
certificate
if
he
finds
that
the
person
is
able
to
conduct
a
safe
operation.
that
is
all.
the
administrator
may
attach
conditions
to
these
certificates
that
further
this
particular
end,
that
is,
a
safe
operation.
section
611
of
the
federal
aviation
act
of
1958,
which
played
a
prominent
part
in
this
case,
was
added
in
1968.
it
confers
on
the
federal
aviation
administrator
the
power
to
issue
such
rules
and
regulations
as
he
may
find
necessary
to
provide
for
the
control
and
abatement
of
aircraft
noise
and
sonic
boom.
if
this
section
conferred
on
the
administrator
the
power
to
regulate
airports
in
terms
of
noise,
he
has
specifically
refrained
from
so
doing
and
has
repeatedly
affirmed
the
freedom
of
airport
proprietors
to
exclude
aircraft
from
their
airports
on
the
basis
of
noise
considerations.
the
district
court,
in
its
decision,
held
the
ordinance
to
be
invalid
on
the
ground
of
preemption,
conflict,
and
the
unreasonable
burden
which
the
ordinance
would
have
if
it
were
applied
to
all
major
airports
throughout
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
decision,
did
not
reach
the
commerce
clause
issue
and
restricted
its
decision
to
the
supremacy
clause
matters.
it
held,
the
ordinance
to
be
repugnant
to
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
on
the
ground
of
preemption
and
also
on
the
ground
of
conflict.
the
conflict
issue,
it
cited,
at
last
of
the
faa
tower
chief’s
noise
abatement
runway
procedures
and
also
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
interfered
with
the
sunday
night
intrastate
flight
of
psa.
the
court
of
appeals
broadly
held
in
its
decision
that
the
pervasiveness
of
the
federal
regulation
in
the
field
of
air
commerce,
the
national
interest
in
such
regulation,
and
the
nature
of
air
commerce
itself
precluded
states
and
local
governments
from
enacting
this
type
of
regulation.
the
district
court
in
its
decision,
holding
that
the
ordinance
had
to
be
viewed
in
the
aspect
as
if
it
were
applied
to
all
major
airports
in
the
united
states.
it
was
a
holding
along
with
the
broad
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
made
it
necessary
that
we
apply
to
this
court
for
hearing.
the
ordinance
comes
before
this
court
with
the
presumption
that
it
was
reasonable
and
necessary.
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
demonstrated
the
airport’s
inadequacies.
the
airport
is
simply
not
operable
without
being
used
of
adjacent
private
property
for
its
approach
ways
and
its
takeoffs.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
noted
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
that
the
airport
created
to
those
that
resided
in
its
vicinity.
this
problem
was
further
underscored
by
the
various
statements
made
by
the
faa
tower
chief
in
these
various
noise
abatement
runway
procedures.
he
stated,
for
example,
that
the
area
within
5
miles
of
the
airport
was
noise
sensitive.
he
made
further
reference
to
the
numerous
complaints,
the
possible
result
of
requiring
the
closing
down
of
runways
and
entire
airports.
this
brings
me
to
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on.
it
is
against
the
background
that
i’ve
just
stated
that
we
asserted
in
our
brief
that
the
commerce
clause
cannot
shield
those
who
invade
fifth
amendment
rights,
and
that
legislation,
such
as
the
burbank
ordinance,
must
be
sustained
if
that
amendment
is
to
have
any
real
meaning.
we
pursue
this
especially
in
view
of
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
roe
versus
wade.
by
that
decision,
it
is
now
firmly
established
that
a
right
of
privacy
exists
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
is
no
specific
mention
of
this
right
in
the
constitution.
as
we
understand
the
court’s
opinion,
this
fundamental
right
is
founded
on
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
concept
of
personal
liberty
and
restriction
on
state
action.
if
this
be
so,
then
the
same
right
of
privacy
must
exist
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
a
restriction
on
the
powers
of
the
federal
government.
this
decision
along
with
griswold
versus
connecticut,
in
our
view,
gives
form
and
substance
to
the
belief
of
the
signers
of
the
declaration
of
independence
that
certain
unalienable
rights
existed,
including
the
right
to
life,
liberty,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
it
is,
in
this
respect.
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
is
correct
in
holding
that
the
federal
government
has
preempted
the
rights
of
states
and
local
governments
and
the
people
from
doing
something
about
this
invasion
into
their
right
of
privacy,
then
we
feel
that
this
particular
decision
is
most
important
and
is
applicable
as
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
what
i’m
trying
to
get
to
is
that
a
declaration
of
preemption,
whether
it
be
by
congress
or
by
the
court,
which
leaves
unprotected
fundamental
rights
of
the
people
such
as
are
involved
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
and
the
declaration--
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
the
invasion
of
a
declaration
of
preemption
is
by
the
government,
the
federal
government.
if
it
leaves
fundamental
rights
unprotected,
it
is,
in
our
view,
impermissible.
let
me
pursue
it
just
a
little
further
and
maybe
i
can
more
appropriately
demonstrate
what
i’m
driving
at.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
that’s
the
governmental
action,
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
to
you--
now,
i
recognize
in
roe
versus
wade
we
have
a
certain
right
of
privacy.
that
is
not
exactly
comparable
to
the
right
of
privacy
that
we
feel
is
involved
here.
what
we
say
is
that
the
right
of
privacy
involved
in
this
case
is
based
on
the
same
principle
of
personal
liberty
and
based
on
the
same
considerations.
noise
pollution,
as
we
see
it,
whatever
its
form,
impinges
on
the
right
to
be
let
alone
and
invades
the
right
of
privacy.
it
disturbs
thought
and
contemplation.
it
intrudes
into
the
home,
interfering
with
family-like
conversation
and
sleep.
it
has
other
more
drastic
side
effects
such
as
hearing
loss
and
irritation
which,
if
long
continued,
can
distinct--
can
interfere
with
man’s
ability
to
deal
with
other
aspects
of
his
environment.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
i
have
indicated
something
along
that
line
in
my
brief,
and
i
thought
it
best
since
i
had
this
problem
of
presentation
that
i
restrict
myself
to
noise
pollution
because
noise
pollution
does
invade
the
right
of
privacy.
i
would
believe
until
this
court
enunciates
a
further
unenumerated
right
existing
in
the
constitution,
i
have
been
going
beyond
the
scope
of
my
endeavor
here
to
have
gotten
into
those
areas.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
if
it
produced
the
volume
and
the
effects
of
jet
aircraft,
yes,
but
i--
there
is
no
proper
comparison
between
the
two.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
i
was
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
if
it
produced--
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
if
it
produced
the
same
kind
of
problem
that
the
jet
engine
in
an
aircraft
produces,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
not
if
the
rule
that
i
hope
to
present
to
the
court
is
adopted
by
the
court.
i
feel,
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
indicated,
that
this
is
a
declaration
of
im--
a
preemption
is
impermissible
when
it
leaves
unprotected
fundamental
rights,
whatever
they
may
be.
if
it’s
water
pollution,
if
it’s
air
pollution,
noise
pollution,
or
whatever
may
affect--
substantially
affect
the
health
and
safety
of
people
but
that,
of
course,
is
going
beyond
what
i
intended
to
argue
in
this
matter.
mr.
richard
l.
sieg,
jr.
not--
no,
sir.
i--
no,
sir.
if
preemption
isn’t
involved,
obviously,
the
ordinance
is
valid.
it
is
valid
anyway
on
the
grounds
that
we’ve
argued
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
federal
preemption,
no
conflict.
but,
as
we
view
the
matter,
there
are
able
to--
the
rights
reserved
to
the
people
can
be
protected
by
any
level
of
government.
it’s
not
in
the
exclusive
power
of
the
federal
government
to
protect
those
rights.
the
people
have
many
means.
the
courts,
of
course,
are
the
primary
right,
and
the
primary
method,
at
least
in
this
century,
of
indicating
fundamental
rights,
especially
civil
rights.
we’re
dealing
in
this
case
with
human
rights,
and
we
need
some
rule
that
allows
action
by
the
people
trough
whatever
governmental
body
will
listen
to
them
to
protect
these
rights
reasonably.
we
do
not
contend
in
this
case
that
the
fundamental
right
of
privacy
involved
here
is
absolute.
we
say
that
the
right
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
its
effect,
and
there
has
to
be
a
balancing.
that
is,
that
the
people
is
entitled
to
all
reasonable
and
necessary
protection,
not
absolute
protection.
the
balancing
that
we
feel
is
proper
is
somewhat
along
the
lines
suggested
in
southern
pacific
versus
arizona.
the
extent
of
the
intrusion
should
be
weighed
against
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
and
if
the
enactment,
the
ordinance,
or
the
state
law,
or
whatever
it
may
be
provides
substantial
and
necessary
relief,
it
should
have
a
greater
weight
in
the
balancing.
i
might
add
that
the
court
may
recall,
and
again
i’m
striking
at
this
doctrine
of
preemption
and
conflict,
but
the
first
four--
the
first
two
of
the
grievances
that
are
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
independence
against
the
king
of
great
britain
were
these
two.
he
has
refused
his
assent
to
loss
the
most
wholesome
and
most
necessary
for
the
public
good.
he
has
forbidden
his
governors
to
pass
laws
of
immediate
and
pressing
importance
unless
suspended
on
their
operation
‘til
his
assent
should
be
obtained.
the
similarity
between
these
grievances
and
the
grievances
that
are
set
forth
in
the
declarations
of
preemption
contained
in
the
more
recent
congressional
enactments,
especially
the
noise
control
act
of
1972,
are
worthy
of
note.
we
submit,
as
a
proposition
worthy
of
this
court’s
consideration,
that
a
congressional
declaration
of
preemption
cannot
be
considered
a
rightful
exercise
of
legislative
authority
where,
in
that
effect,
is
to
leave
fundamental
rights
of
the
people
unprotected.
what
we’re
really
saying
is
the
application
here
of
the
dormant
and
unexercised
power
rule
that
is
set
forth
in
head
and
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission.
even
though
there
is
expressed
or
implied
congressional
declaration
of
preemption,
the
country
has
to
have
it.
when
you
observe
that
for
more
than
10
years,
some-7
odd
million
people
of
the
united
states
has
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
air
commerce
with
the
only
remedy
afforded,
if
you
can
call
it
a
remedy,
is
a
right
to
seek
damages,
if
they
own
the
property
on
which
they
reside,
as
against
the
airport
proprietor.
this,
to
us,
is
contrary
to
the
fundamental
rights
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution.
we
equally
feel
that
the
time
has
come
for
the
courts
to
take
a
direct
hand
in
this
matter.
the
solicitor
general
affirms
in
his
brief,
and
i
assume
he
will
argue
accordingly,
that
states
and
local
governments,
whether
they
are
proprietors
or
non-proprietors,
can
enact
reasonable
regulations
to
control
the
noise
problem
in
connection
with
airports
within
their
jurisdiction.
but,
suppose
the
governmental
entity,
having
jurisdiction,
refuses
or
fails
to
give
the
residents
in
their
vicinity
appropriate
and
necessary
relief,
only
the
courts
are
then
available.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
problem
has
escalated
to
such
a
point
that
the
lower
federal
courts
should
take
a
hand
in
the
matter
and,
if
necessary,
require
from
these
airport
