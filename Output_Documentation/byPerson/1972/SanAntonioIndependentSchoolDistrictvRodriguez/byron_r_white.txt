justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
would
still
be
an
equal
input
and
there
could
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
texas
system,
it’s
impossible
for
some
districts
to
have
a
sufficient
input
even
if
they’re
willing
to
tax
themselves
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
this
is
really
power
equalization
that
you
have
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
get
the
same
result
in
the
sense
that
anything
over
a
minimum--
a
minimum
is
guaranteed
and
districts
may
make
up
their
own
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
it
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
if,
in
some
way,
a
court
could
decide
what
was
the
minimum
level
of
education?
it
was
found
that
many
districts
in
texas
didn’t
come
up
to
that
level
and
couldn’t
really,
under
the
former,
because
the
property
in
the
district
just
couldn’t
predict
the
district
to
limit
it
and
the
state
foundation
program
just
doesn’t
bring
it
up
to
a
minimum
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
then,
we
must
decide
then
whether
the--
to
your
view,
we
must
agree
with
you
that
the
foundation
programs
brings
it
up
to
a
minimum
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
a
violation
if
it
didn’t.
don’t
we
have
to
decide
it
if
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
difference
between
or
one
difference
between
the
power
equalization
and
your
system
is
that
under
power
equalization,
if
the
district
chose
to
tax
itself
on
a
higher
rate
it
could
get
more
money
even
if
the
pro--
even
if
the
pro--
even
if
it
was
a
poor
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
so,
under
the
texas
system
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer
is
that
state
contribution
does
not
provide
an
adequate
education?
justice
byron
r.
white
myour
position
then,
just
straight
out,
that
the
state
must
provide
equal
input
into
every
school
district
in
the
state
that
whatever
the
system
they
have,
whether
it’s
property
tax
or
any
other
system,
or
whatever
the--
whatever
scheme
you
have
is
going
to
have
equal
input
is
otherwise
per
student.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
have
an
equal--
overall
equal--
unequal
input
into
two
districts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
the
state
just
had
an
income
tax,
no
property
tax
at
all,
and
it
just
gave
one
school
district
$500
a
child
and
another
school
district
$600.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
could
it
give
it
one
district
more
than
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
that
ends
up
with
wide
disparities
between
school
districts
is
what
they
get.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
the
local
people
make
up
their
mind
they
haven’t
have
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it’s
not
under
power
equalization
if,
after
providing
a
minimum
education
if
a
district
decided
that
they
wanted
to
spend
more
money
on
education,
they
could
just--
they
could
decide
to
spend
it.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
assuming--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
let’s
assume
one
district
decided
that
and
they
want
to
spend
$800
a
student
and
another
district
said
“well,
we
just
don’t
believe
in
education
that
well.
well,
we’ll
just
go
to
500.”
would
that
be
alright
under
your--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
the
state
may
provide
unequal
inputs.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that’s
only
if
the
state
guarantees
a
minimum,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
understand
your
position,
but
you
go
ahead
with
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
just
want
to--
in
deciding
the
case,
i
suppose
it’s
important
to
know
is
there
any
system
that
you
could
think
of
that
would
satisfy
your
objections
to
the
present
texas
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
other
than
just
simply
state
control.
you
say
you
don’t
need
to
go
to
state
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
get
your
position,
it’s
not
that
just
the
unequal
inputs
per
se
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
your
fund--
so
far,
it
sounds
like
you’re
saying
that
the
fact
that
there
are
some
districts
that
are
locked
in
is
what
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
there’s
nothing
they
can
do
about
you
having
a
better
education,
either
from
the
state
foundation
program
or
from
taxing
at
higher
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
seems
to
be
your
major
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
apparently
it
would
satisfy
your
position
if
edgewood,
under
some
other
system,
had
the
opportunity
to
get
out
buy
chose
not
to
and
stayed
precisely
at
the
present
level
of
education.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
if
it
chose
not
to.
it
had
the
opportunity
but
decided
not
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
you’d
leave
that
to
edgewood,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
the
majority
of
the
people
in
edgewood
could
lock
in
a
minority
in
edgewood
who
wanted
to
get
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
yours
is
voluntary
with
a
vengeance,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
voluntary
with
a
vengeance,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
think
they
did
or
you
wouldn’t
say
that
would
be
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
your
position
on
that
system
if
there’s
something
about
the
compelling
system?
i
mean,
that’s
really
the
question.
would
it
be
constitutional
or
wouldn’t
it
for
edgewood
to
have
the
opportunity
but
choose
not
to
exercise
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
your
case
does
a
lot
depend
on
these
factors.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
would
still
be
an
equal

there
