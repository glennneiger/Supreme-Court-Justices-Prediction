justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
the--
in
effect,
if
it’s
not
conceded
then
at
least
it’s
not
denied
that
the
present
foundation
of
contribution
to
the
local
school
district
is
sufficient
to
provide
an
adequate
education?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
i’m
just
curious.
on
district
power
equalization,
what
about
the
percentage
of
ratables
which
is--
don’t
they
differ
in
texas?
they
seem
to,
in
some
places,
assess
30%
and
some
of
them
80
and
some
of
them
100?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gochman,
do
you--
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
you.
do
you
say
that
there’s
an
inevitable
correlation
between
district
wealth
and
income
of
families?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
is
whether
this
is
a
necessary
correlation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
asked
my
question
because,
and
it’s
an
unfair
one,
but
i
ask
it
from
personal
experience.
i
come
from
a
state
of
varied
economic
areas.
the
minnesota
range,
the
iron
range,
was
the
most
comparatively
poor
range
as
far
as
family
income
was
concerned.
and
yet,
in
my
day,
it
was
the
iron
range
that
had
the
best
schools.
they
were
the
ones
with
the
swimming
pools
and
the
tennis
courts
and
the
extra
facilities
and
the
highest
paid
teachers.
the
reason
was
that
the
tax
rates
up
there
hit
the
steel
companies.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gochman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
carry
your
general
theory
across
the
state
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what’s
your
answer
to
mr.
wright’s
suggestion
that
the
state
foundation
contribution
is
adequate
to
provide--
that
the
contribution
is
sufficient
to
provide
an
adequate
education?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
what
you--
your
answer
to
justice
white
a
few
minutes
ago
leave
me
with
the
impression
that
district
power
equalization
could
produce
precisely
the
picture
of
which
you
complain
today.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
power
equalizing
ultimately
produce
precisely
the
picture
of
which
you
complain
in
texas
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
can
correctly
understand
you.
now,
you
said
even
if
you
went
to
power
equalization
and
edgewood
had
the
opportunity
to
get
out
of
this
situation,
if
it
chose
not
to
get
out
of
it,
the
state
would
not
be
free
to
make
that
choice
that
you
just
said
to
me,
that
would
still,
if
it
chose
not
to,
the
choice
not
to
would
itself
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection.
do
you
say
that?
