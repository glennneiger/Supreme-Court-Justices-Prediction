mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
take
those
texts
from
my
argument
this
morning,
a
sentence
from
an
article
that
professor
coons
and
his
collaborators,
professors
sugarman
and
clune,
wrote
last
year.
it’s
quoted--
cited
on
page
44
of
my
initial
brief.
they
said
“of
all
public
functions,
education
in
its
goals
and
methods,
is
least
understood
and
most
in
need
of
local
variety,
experimentation,
and
independence.
that,
i
think,
is
wise
counsel.i
believe
that
is
the
argument
for
reversal
in
this
case.
in
our
view,
the
texas
system
of
school
finance,
imperfect
as
it
is,
we
conceded
its
imperfections
in
our
brief.
the
texas
system
does
allow
through
local
variety,
and
experimentation,
and
independence.
not
as
much
as
i
would
like
it
too,
but
that
is
its
goal.
that
is
its
rationale
and,
for
that
reason,
there
is
a
rational
basis
to
it
and
i
will
undertake
it
of
course
in
a
moment,
our
view
that
the
rational
basis
test
is
the
appropriate
test.
the
view
adopted
by
the
district
court
that
there
is
a
rigid
constitutional
mandate
for
the
quality
of
education
may
not
be
a
function
of
wealth
except
the
wealth
of
the
state
as
a
whole,
and
my
submission
is
based
on
educational
assumptions
about
matters
that
are,
today,
not
understood
and
which
educators
are
not
ready
to
form
firm
judgments
and
it
would
seriously
inhibit,
if
it
would
not
destroy,
all
together
the
possibilities
for
local
variety
experimentation.
dependence
of
which,
as
professors
coons
and
elle
quite
properly
speaks
of
warmly.
proposition
one,
the
proposition
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
would
impose
a
constitutional
straightjacket
on
the
public
schools
of
50
states.
it
would
mean
that,
hereafter
and
permanently,
or
at
least
until
a
new
book
is
written
and
the
constitution
changes
again,
that
all
measurements
in
terms
of
school--
of
education
of
public
schools
must
be
in
terms
of
per
capita
or
per
pupil,
student
expenditures
even
though
there
may
be
many
other
things
that
we
ought
to
be
worrying
about
in
an
effort
to
cure
the
problems
of
public
education.
it
would
not
necessarily
destroy
all
local
control.
there
is
the
variation
presented
by
professor
coons
and
his
associates
described
as
district
power
equalizer.
if
district
power
equalizing
is
consistent
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
below
and
the
court
did
not
undertake
to
speak
to
that
question
at
all,
it
left
it
completely
open,
then
it
would
still
be
possible
for
an
individual
school
district
to
decide
“we
want
to
spend
more
money
here
than
that
other
school
district
to
spend
it,”
and
there
would
be
an
elaborate
system
so
that
this
could
be
done
and
its
inability
to
do
so
would
simply
depend
on
the
tax
rate
the
district
was
willing
to
impose
on
itself.
it
would
not
depend
on
the
taxable
property
in
the
district.
that
would
leave
local
control
still
in
the
schools.
to
that
extent,
it
is
far
better
than
any
notions
of
centralized
state
funding
on
a
single
statewide
formula,
but
as
we
pointed
out
both
in
our
brief
and
both
of
our
briefs,
and
particularly
in
our
reply
brief.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
district
power
equalizing
is
a
viable
alternative,
then
this
case
has
seized
to
be
a
case
about
education
at
all.
that
we
are
no
longer
concerned
with
whether
the
children
in
the
edgewood
school
district
have
an
education
inferior
to
those
in
alamo
heights
because
this
would
still
be
possible
if
the
voters
of
alamo
heights
decided
that
they
would
assume
a
larger
tax
burden
of
the
tax
rate
and
the
voter
is
edgewood.
on
the
district
power
equalizing
solution,
this
becomes
a
case
for
the
release
of
the
taxpayers
rather
than
a
case
to
help
out
school
children.
many
of
the
writers
who
support
drastic
reform
and
who
would
support
reform
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
judgment
and
said
that
the
district
power
equalizing
solution
would,
itself,
be
unconstitutional
because
it
would
make
the
number
of
dollars
spent
on
a
child
depending
on
what
his
friends
and
neighbors
think.
i
must
say
that
in
view
of
what
this--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
certainly
could
be.
in
fact,
the
whole
reason
for
having
district
power
equalizing
would
be
to
unequal
input
possible.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
they
have
a
sufficient
input,
is
that
your
words,
justice
white?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
not
agree
with
that,
sir,
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
we
believe
that
our
state
foundation
program
has
assured
to
every
district
the
sufficient
input
for
an
adequate
education
and
then
it
has
left
every
district
to
decide
for
itself,
“what,
if
anything
more?”
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
don’t
think
that
ours
is
power
equalization.
i
think
that
ours
is
not
a
book
of
choice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that’s
right,
yes.
i,
of
course,
don’t
think
the
proposition,
one,
appears
in
the
small
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
that
if
the
texas
system
in
this
respect
resembles
power
equalizing,
it
doesn’t
bother
me
but
i
would
think
that
it
should
bother
my
friend,
mr.
gochman,
and
it
should
bother
professor
coons
because
i
don’t
see
how
the
unequal
input
of
power
equalizing
can
be
defended
if
the
constitution
says
you
can’t
have
any
input.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
constitutional
case
for
me
to
defend,
yes.
i
don’t
want
to
concede
that
i
would
necessary
loose
it
because
it
is
not
my
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
think
that
simply
is
not
an
issue
here,
that
a--
there
is
hardly
so
much
as
an
allegation
or--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
decide
that.
i’m
prepared
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
argument,
justice
white,
but
without
foreclosing,
what
i
may
say
the
next
time
i’m
up
before
you
on
a
different
case,
to
concede
that
there
is
a
constitutional
minimum
that
could
be
required.
i
think
that
there
were
certainly
overtones
of
that
in
yoder
last
term
when
the
court
talked
about
a
basic
education
in
court
of
what
thomas
jefferson
had
to
say
about
it
and
things
of
that
sort,
so
that
i
can
understand
what
is
a
viable
constitutional
argument
that
a
minimum
education
is
required,
but
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
issue
between
the
parties
in
this
case
on
whether
or
not
texas
is
providing
minimum
education.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
my
understandings
of--
that
it
is
not
denied.
i
certainly
would
not
want
to
put
words
in
the
mouths
of
my
friends,
but
their
pleading
is
not
drawn
on
the
theory
that
the
foundation
program
doesn’t
give
edgewood
enough.
their
theory
is
that
it
doesn’t
give
edgewood
as
much
as
alamo
heights,
that
there
is
the
constitutional
violation
and
that
is
certainly
the
constitutional
violation
found
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
made
no
finding
that
we
fall
below
whatever
the
constitutional
minimum
may
be.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
wouldn’t
want
to
accept
that
entirely,
justice
rehnquist,
because
power
equalizing
is
always
put
in
terms
of
the
taxable
property
per
pupil
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
in
terms
of
what
row
you
have
to
hoe
in
order
to
put
a
tax
rate
on
yourself,
it
is
really
income,
your
ability
to
pay,
that
is
important
if,
in
a
wealth
district,
the
same
rate
would
be
a
much
smaller
proportion
of
the
income.
so
that,
in
that
sense,
in
terms
of
the
marginal
utility
of
the
dollar,
it
would
still
be
easier
for
wealthy
people
to
vote
to
spend
more
money
that
it
would
for
poor
people
to
do
so
but,
as
professor
coon
says,
it
is
brought
as
a
matter
upon
which
pragmatism
must
triumph
over
principle.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don’t
know
such
a
case.
i
would
say
there
were
certainly
strong
implications
in
the
prince
edward
county
case
that
the
state
could
do
exactly
that
if
it--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i--
of
course,
you
are
closer
to
make
my
concession
in
terms
of
this
case.
i
think
i
can
safely
concede
it
here
and
that
i
don’t
have
to
take
along
that
argument
in
order
to
win
this
case.
the--
even
if
the
cons--
the
minimum
is
constitutionally
required,
texas
wins
here,
but
i
do
think--
i
must
say,
i’m
attracted,
justice
rehnquist,
as
a
scholar
to
the
argument
that
it
might
be,
despite
the
animations
of
your
previous
cases,
that
today
the
failure
of
a
state
to
provide
an
education
all
together
would
inhibit
the
first
amendment
rights
that
a
state
has
an
obligation
to
teach
children
to
read
and
to
write.
i
don’t
know
that
i
would
accept
that
argument,
but
i
can
see
the
possibilities
of
the
sketching
out
an
argument
on
that
point.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
he
said
something
of
the
sort
in
palmer
v.
thompson,
the
swimming
pool
case
where
it
was
dictum.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
certainly
must
do
it
for
everybody,
yes.
if
we’re
going
to
do
it
for
any,
then
we
must
do
it
for
every
young
person
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
no,
i
would
think
that,
unless
we
can
implicate
the
state
in
some
way
to
find
that
this
is
a
state
action,
just
doing
it--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
for
some
purposes
as
they
are,
but
whether
they
are
for
purposes
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
in
this
kind
of
sense,
there
i
would
say
your
decisions
are
to
the
contrary.
they
say
that
to
have
things
different
in
one
county
than
it
is
in
another
county
is
not
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
that,
of
course,
would--
those
were
not
education
cases,
in
which,
that
were
being
said.
in
one
of
them,
maryland
had
different
penalties
in
one
county
for
a
crime
than
it
had
in
another
county
to
upheld
that
in
a
consistent
line
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
stewart--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
sure.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
they
differ
very
widely
in
texas
as
they
do
in
most
states,
justice
brennan,
and
i
think
that
if
a
state
were
do
adopt
district
power
equalizing,
it,
as
a
practical
matter,
would
have
to
adopt
statewide
assessing.
i
don’t
see
any
other
language
the
scheme
would
be
feasible.
otherwise,
you
simply
use
a
favorable
rate
and
you
cheat.
you
get
more
than
you’re
entitled
to,
and
i
think
that
demonstrates
the
further
encouraging
on
local
government
that
the
ideas
presented
here
by
the
appellees
would
represent
that
very
little
is
to
be
left
of
local
government
if
the
decision
bellow
is
to
be
affirmed.
we
contend,
of
course,
that
if
we
are
subject
only
to
the
rational
basis
test
that
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases
in
which
we
must
demonstrate
a
compelling
state
interest
in
order
to
justify
the
results
for
which
we
argue
and
justify
the
state
plan,
and
we
think
that
there’re
quite
a
number
of
very
recent
cases
from
this
court,
some
of
them
ignored
by
the
lower
court
and
some
more
recent,
that
show
exactly
that
and
that
show
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
impose
a
constitutional
straightjacket
on
the
states
in
difficult
and
intractable
questions
of
social
reform,
welfare,
economics.
dandridge,
lindsey,
jefferson
v.
hackney,
cases
of
that
kind
and
we
think
that
this
is
squarely
in
the
area
with
which
we
are
concerned.
the
appellees
undertake
to
distinguish
these
and
to
suggest
that,
in
some
way,
education--
the
educational
needs
of
the
poor
are
fundamental
while
their
needs
for
food
and
for
housing
are
not.
and,
with
respect,
this
is
a
distinction
that
i
think
simply
is
not
a
tenable
one,
that
it
is
hard
to
say
that
a
higher
salaried
school
teacher
is
more
fundamental
to
a
poor
child
than
food
or
a
sunroof
over
his
head.
i
see,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
lunch
hour
is
here.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
time
that
remains
to
me,
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
factual
assumptions
that
underlie
the
judgment
below
and
the
arguments
of
the
appellees.
i
would
like
to
make
perfectly
clear
what
our
position
is
with
regard
to
those
because
there
is
some
suggestion,
particularly
to
the
amicus
briefs
that’s
part
of
the
appellees,
that
texas
is
asking
this
court
to
resolve
the
very
vexing
questions
on
the
relation
of
money
to
quality
and
education
and
on
whether
or
not
persons
who
are
individually
poor
are
not
likely
to
be
found
in
school
districts
that
are
in
terms
of
taxable
property,
collectively
poor.
we,
of
course,
are
not
asking
you
to
settle
those
questions.
our
submission
is
that
these
are
intensely
difficult
questions
on
which
no
answers
in
the
present
state
of
knowledge
are
possible
and
that
this
court
should
not
undertake
to
resolve
matters
on
which
educators
and
social
scientists
cannot
come
up
with
any
answers.
we
had
felt
it
necessary
to
discuss
the
questions
because,
as
we
understand
it,
the
position
of
our
friends
would
require
you
to
resolve
these
issues.
the
decision
below,
though
it
never
discusses
the
issue,
makes
the
implicit
assumption
that,
in
education,
money
is
quality.
now,
the
assumption
is
explicit
in
the
writings
of
professor
coons,
his
associates,
and
others
who
have
written
on
that.
the
district
court
never
spoke
to
it,
but
the
district
court
looked
at
figures
about
numbers
of
dollars
spent
and
then
announced
a
constitutional
requirement
that
the
quality
of
education
cannot
be
allowed
to
vary
except
as
a
function
of
the
wealth
of
the
state
as
a
whole
and,
thus,
implicitly
assumed
what
we
think
no
court
can
safely
assume
because,
in
fact,
we
are
very
skeptical
that
it
is
even
true
that,
beyond
some
minimum,
quality
is
money.
the
district
court
did
explicitly
find
that
there
is
a
correlation
between
poor
people
and
poor
school
districts.
the
finding
of
the
district
court
in
that
regard
is
based
on
the
readings
at
the
extremes
of
a
chart
that
was
offered
in
evidence.
its
determination
in
that
regard
has
been
criticized
not
only
in
our
briefs
and
in
our
testimony
at
the
trial,
but
in
the
literature.
in
our
brief,
we
set
out
the
discussion
of
the
finding
on
that
point
by
professor
goldstein
in
his
article
in
the
pennsylvania
law
review
and
the
issue
of
the
air
log
journal
that
was
published
in
tuesday
of
this
week.
there
is
a
lengthy
student
note
that
is,
again,
very
critical
of
the
finding
in
rodriguez
on
that
point
that
appears
at
page
1312,
notes
40
and
41
of
the
yale
note
and
that
the
subject
has
is
recurred
to
again
at
page
1327
of
the
yale
note
on
why
you
cannot
undertake
to
conclude
a
correlation
between
individual
poverty
and
district
poverty
on
the
basis
of
the
kinds
of
figures
that
the
district
judge
relied
on.
we’ve
presented
also
in
our
briefs
disinterested
studies
elsewhere
in
kansas
and
in
california
that
have
said
“no,
this
relation
does
not
exist.”
the
central
finding
of
the
yale
note
based
on
virtually
complete
data
of
the
entire
state
of
connecticut
and
on
a
far
more
sophisticated
statistical
analysis
than
any
i
have
seen
anywhere
in
the
literature
is
that
there
is
no
such
relation
in
the
state
of
connecticut
that,
indeed,
the
relation
tends
to
be
an
inverse
one,
that
it
is
the
poor
people
who
live
in
the
area
where
the
most
is
being
spent
on
education
and
the
rich
people
live
in
the
areas
where
the
least
is
being
spent
on
education.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
racial
issue
is
in
the--
this
litigation,
yes,
justice
douglas.
it
is
a
major
portion
of
the
plaintiffs’
complaint.
the
trial
court
did
not
rely
on
it
in
its
opinion.
it
put
its
holding
squarely
on
the
dollar
inequality
without
regard
to
whether
the
particular
plaintiffs
were
of
spanish
ancestry
or
anglo
or
black,
but
the
issue
is
certainly
there.
we
think
that
the
issue
is
one
that
is
fairly
readily
answered
that,
although
it
is
of
course
quite
true
that
in
the
edgewood
district
in
bexar
county,
texas
the
great
majority
of
the
students
are
of
spanish
origin
and
not
as
much
money
is
spent
there
as
in
other
school
districts,
but
we
doubt
that
this
would
be
found
to
be
true
as
a
general
matter.
but,
the
poor
school
districts
are
not
that
congruent
with
racial
distributions
that
it
is,
in
other
words,
a
happenstance
that
we
have
a
case
in
which
we
have
particular
plaintiffs
who
are
mexican-american
and
to
live
in
a
district
with
low
taxable
resources.
again,
on
these
factual
statistical
problems,
we
think
that
the
state
of
the
literature
simply
does
not
permit
the
conclusions
that
are
essential
to
the
position
of
my
friend
and
that,
even
their
conclusions
were
sent,
we
still
think
that
our
legal
argument
would
have
great
merit.
but,
if
there
are
conclusions
are
not
demonstrable
at
the
present
time
because
they
are
the
essential
premises
of
result
for
which
they
are
due.
we
think
that
the
inability
to
demonstrate
the
accuracy
of
these
assumptions
is
fatal
to
their
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
exactly
the
sense
in
which
i
use
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think,
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i’d
like
to
begin
to
further
word
on
the
racial
aspects
proposed
by
justice
douglas
in
a
question
to
me
and
also
in
mr.
gochman’s
argument,
in
response
to
that,
simply
quoted
from
a
book
by
professors
coons,
sugarman,
and
clune.
they
say
it
is
not--
the
quotation
appears
on
page
24
of
our
initial
brief.
“it
is
not
surprising
that
even
the
present
litigation
is
understood
by
many
of
its
close
supporters
as
a
racial
struggle.”
the
fact
is,
otherwise,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
the
system
of
district
based
school
finance
embodies
racial
bias.
no
doubt,
there
are
poor
districts
which
are
basically
negro,
but
it
is
basically
clear,
almost
by
definition,
the
vast
preponderance
of
such
districts
is
white.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
but
i
think
that
you
are
bound
to
take
into
account
the
findings
of
serious
students
such
as
professor
coons
in
determining
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
means
on
a
nationwide
basis.
professor
coons
and
his
associates
supported
that
statement,
justice
rehnquist,
by
a
figure
showing
that
in
california,
for
example,
59%
of
minority
students
live
in
districts
in
which
the
assessed
values
are
above
the
medium
and,
therefore,
if
we
had
strict
equalization
they
would
get
less
now.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
i
think
with
respect,
sir,
that
in
determining
the
rule
of
law
that
the
particular
facts
of
the
edgewood
school
district
or
about
california
or
any
other
particular
place
are
all
merely
parts
of
an
overall
mosaic
that
you
must
appraise
in
deciding
does
the
constitution
or
does
it
not
require
this.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
were
allegations
to
that
effect.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
the
judgment
below--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
does
not
rely
on
that,
no.
i’m
not
here
to
apologize
for
the
texas
school
finance
system,
though
i’ve
said
repeatedly,
it
seems
to
me,
far
from
perfect.
i
think
the
texas
system
does
assure,
as
evidence
in
the
record
shows,
more
than
merely
a
minimum.
it
ensures
a
basic
education
to
every
school
child
in
the
state
and
then
lets
districts,
if
they
have
money
and
want
to
spend
money,
go
beyond
that.
as
i
understand,
the
argument
of
my
friend
mr.
gochman,
it
would
not
matter
if
texas
were
giving
each
school
district
$2,000
per
student.
if
alamo
heights
were
still
free
to
tax
with
its
heavy
resources
and
spend
more
than
edgewood
was,
he
would
still
find
this
to
be
impermissible
although,
for
reasons
that
are
not
persuasive
to
me,
he
regards
the
same
result
as
quite
different
if
it
stands
from
district
power
equalizing
than
it
comes
out
of
the
mere
facts
as
they
are.
i
said,
several
times,
in
my
brief,
i
want
to
say
here
and
say
with
the
utmost
sincerity
how
much
i
admire
the
creative
scholarship
of
professor
coons
and
his
associates
and
my
colleague
professor
yudof
and
others
who
are
ripped
in
the
field
and
i
admire
also
the
devotion
and
ability
which
mr.
gochman
has
persevered
in
this
case.
these
people
have
opened
the
eyes
of
the
whole
country
to
a
very
serious
problem.
i
think
that
everyone
in
this
courtroom
would
agree
that
what
we
want
is
better
education
for
all
children
and
especially
for
poor
children,
that
the
real
differences
between
us
are
whether
a
new
system
should
be
adopted
because
this
court
finds
that
the
constitution
requires
it
or
whether
we
look
to
legislatures
to
provide
remedies,
and
the
difference
about
whether
the
proposals
they
make
would,
indeed,
lead
to
better
education
or
only
more
expensive
education,
whether
they
would
relieve
poor
children
or
only
children
who
happen
to
live
in
poor
school
districts.
and,
indeed,
if
district
power
equalizing
is
to
be
taken
seriously,
whether
the
remedy
that
has
been
offered
here
is
not
one
that
is
of
no
benefit
to
children
but
only
of
benefit
to
taxpayers.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
take
those
texts
from
my
argument
this
morning,
a
sentence
from
an
article
that
professor
coons
and
his
collaborators,
professors
sugarman
and
clune,
wrote
last
year.
it’s
quoted--
cited
on
page
44
of
my
initial
brief.
they
said
“of
all
public
functions,
education
in
its
goals
and
methods,
is
least
understood
and
most
in
need
of
local
variety,
experimentation,
and
independence.
that,
i
think,
is
wise
counsel.i
believe
that
is
the
argument
for
reversal
in
this
case.
in
our
view,
the
texas
system
of
school
finance,
imperfect
as
it
is,
we
conceded
its
imperfections
in
our
brief.
the
texas
system
does
allow
through
local
variety,
and
experimentation,
and
independence.
not
as
much
as
i
would
like
it
too,
but
that
is
its
goal.
that
is
its
rationale
and,
for
that
reason,
there
is
a
rational
basis
to
it
and
i
will
undertake
it
of
course
in
a
moment,
our
view
that
the
rational
basis
test
is
the
appropriate
test.
the
view
adopted
by
the
district
court
that
there
is
a
rigid
constitutional
mandate
for
the
quality
of
education
may
not
be
a
function
of
wealth
except
the
wealth
of
the
state
as
a
whole,
and
my
submission
is
based
on
educational
assumptions
about
matters
that
are,
today,
not
understood
and
which
educators
are
not
ready
to
form
firm
judgments
and
it
would
seriously
inhibit,
if
it
would
not
destroy,
all
together
the
possibilities
for
local
variety
experimentation.
dependence
of
which,
as
professors
coons
and
elle
quite
properly
speaks
of
warmly.
proposition
one,
the
proposition
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
would
impose
a
constitutional
straightjacket
on
the
public
schools
of
50
states.
it
would
mean
that,
hereafter
and
permanently,
or
at
least
until
a
new
book
is
written
and
the
constitution
changes
again,
that
all
measurements
in
terms
of
school--
of
education
of
public
schools
must
be
in
terms
of
per
capita
or
per
pupil,
student
expenditures
even
though
there
may
be
many
other
things
that
we
ought
to
be
worrying
about
in
an
effort
to
cure
the
problems
of
public
education.
it
would
not
necessarily
destroy
all
local
control.
there
is
the
variation
presented
by
professor
coons
and
his
associates
described
as
district
power
equalizer.
if
district
power
equalizing
is
consistent
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
below
and
the
court
did
not
undertake
to
speak
to
that
question
at
all,
it
left
it
completely
open,
then
it
would
still
be
possible
for
an
individual
school
district
to
decide
“we
want
to
spend
more
money
here
than
that
other
school
district
to
spend
it,”
and
there
would
be
an
elaborate
system
so
that
this
could
be
done
and
its
inability
to
do
so
would
simply
depend
on
the
tax
rate
the
district
was
willing
to
impose
on
itself.
it
would
not
depend
on
the
taxable
property
in
the
district.
that
would
leave
local
control
still
in
the
schools.
to
that
extent,
it
is
far
better
than
any
notions
of
centralized
state
funding
on
a
single
statewide
formula,
but
as
we
pointed
out
both
in
our
brief
and
both
of
our
briefs,
and
particularly
in
our
reply
brief.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
district
power
equalizing
is
a
viable
alternative,
then
this
case
has
seized
to
be
a
case
about
education
at
all.
that
we
are
no
longer
concerned
with
whether
the
children
in
the
edgewood
school
district
have
an
education
inferior
to
those
in
alamo
heights
because
this
would
still
be
possible
if
the
voters
of
alamo
heights
decided
that
they
would
assume
a
larger
tax
burden
of
the
tax
rate
and
the
voter
is
edgewood.
on
the
district
power
equalizing
solution,
this
becomes
a
case
for
the
release
of
the
taxpayers
rather
than
a
case
to
help
out
school
children.
many
of
the
writers
who
support
drastic
reform
and
who
would
support
reform
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
judgment
and
said
that
the
district
power
equalizing
solution
would,
itself,
be
unconstitutional
because
it
would
make
the
number
of
dollars
spent
on
a
child
depending
on
what
his
friends
and
neighbors
think.
i
must
say
that
in
view
of
what
this--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
certainly
could
be.
in
fact,
the
whole
reason
for
having
district
power
equalizing
would
be
to
unequal
input
possible.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
they
have
a
sufficient
input,
is
that
your
words,
justice
white?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
not
agree
with
that,
sir,
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
we
believe
that
our
state
foundation
program
has
assured
to
every
district
the
sufficient
input
for
an
adequate
education
and
then
it
has
left
every
district
to
decide
for
itself,
“what,
if
anything
more?”
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
don’t
think
that
ours
is
power
equalization.
i
think
that
ours
is
not
a
book
of
choice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that’s
right,
yes.
i,
of
course,
don’t
think
the
proposition,
one,
appears
in
the
small
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
that
if
the
texas
system
in
this
respect
resembles
power
equalizing,
it
doesn’t
bother
me
but
i
would
think
that
it
should
bother
my
friend,
mr.
gochman,
and
it
should
bother
professor
coons
because
i
don’t
see
how
the
unequal
input
of
power
equalizing
can
be
defended
if
the
constitution
says
you
can’t
have
any
input.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
constitutional
case
for
me
to
defend,
yes.
i
don’t
want
to
concede
that
i
would
necessary
loose
it
because
it
is
not
my
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
think
that
simply
is
not
an
issue
here,
that
a--
there
is
hardly
so
much
as
an
allegation
or--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
decide
that.
i’m
prepared
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
argument,
justice
white,
but
without
foreclosing,
what
i
may
say
the
next
time
i’m
up
before
you
on
a
different
case,
to
concede
that
there
is
a
constitutional
minimum
that
could
be
required.
i
think
that
there
were
certainly
overtones
of
that
in
yoder
last
term
when
the
court
talked
about
a
basic
education
in
court
of
what
thomas
jefferson
had
to
say
about
it
and
things
of
that
sort,
so
that
i
can
understand
what
is
a
viable
constitutional
argument
that
a
minimum
education
is
required,
but
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
issue
between
the
parties
in
this
case
on
whether
or
not
texas
is
providing
minimum
education.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
my
understandings
of--
that
it
is
not
denied.
i
certainly
would
not
want
to
put
words
in
the
mouths
of
my
friends,
but
their
pleading
is
not
drawn
on
the
theory
that
the
foundation
program
doesn’t
give
edgewood
enough.
their
theory
is
that
it
doesn’t
give
edgewood
as
much
as
alamo
heights,
that
there
is
the
constitutional
violation
and
that
is
certainly
the
constitutional
violation
found
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
made
no
finding
that
we
fall
below
whatever
the
constitutional
minimum
may
be.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
wouldn’t
want
to
accept
that
entirely,
justice
rehnquist,
because
power
equalizing
is
always
put
in
terms
of
the
taxable
property
per
pupil
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
in
terms
of
what
row
you
have
to
hoe
in
order
to
put
a
tax
rate
on
yourself,
it
is
really
income,
your
ability
to
pay,
that
is
important
if,
in
a
wealth
district,
the
same
rate
would
be
a
much
smaller
proportion
of
the
income.
so
that,
in
that
sense,
in
terms
of
the
marginal
utility
of
the
dollar,
it
would
still
be
easier
for
wealthy
people
to
vote
to
spend
more
money
that
it
would
for
poor
people
to
do
so
but,
as
professor
coon
says,
it
is
brought
as
a
matter
upon
which
pragmatism
must
triumph
over
principle.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don’t
know
such
a
case.
i
would
say
there
were
certainly
strong
implications
in
the
prince
edward
county
case
that
the
state
could
do
exactly
that
if
it--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i--
of
course,
you
are
closer
to
make
my
concession
in
terms
of
this
case.
i
think
i
can
safely
concede
it
here
and
that
i
don’t
have
to
take
along
that
argument
in
order
to
win
this
case.
the--
even
if
the
cons--
the
minimum
is
constitutionally
required,
texas
wins
here,
but
i
do
think--
i
must
say,
i’m
attracted,
justice
rehnquist,
as
a
scholar
to
the
argument
that
it
might
be,
despite
the
animations
of
your
previous
cases,
that
today
the
failure
of
a
state
to
provide
an
education
all
together
would
inhibit
the
first
amendment
rights
that
a
state
has
an
obligation
to
teach
children
to
read
and
to
write.
i
don’t
know
that
i
would
accept
that
argument,
but
i
can
see
the
possibilities
of
the
sketching
out
an
argument
on
that
point.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
he
said
something
of
the
sort
in
palmer
v.
thompson,
the
swimming
pool
case
where
it
was
dictum.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
certainly
must
do
it
for
everybody,
yes.
if
we’re
going
to
do
it
for
any,
then
we
must
do
it
for
every
young
person
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
no,
i
would
think
that,
unless
we
can
implicate
the
state
in
some
way
to
find
that
this
is
a
state
action,
just
doing
it--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
for
some
purposes
as
they
are,
but
whether
they
are
for
purposes
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
in
this
kind
of
sense,
there
i
would
say
your
decisions
are
to
the
contrary.
they
say
that
to
have
things
different
in
one
county
than
it
is
in
another
county
is
not
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
that,
of
course,
would--
those
were
not
education
cases,
in
which,
that
were
being
said.
in
one
of
them,
maryland
had
different
penalties
in
one
county
for
a
crime
than
it
had
in
another
county
to
upheld
that
in
a
consistent
line
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
stewart--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
sure.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
they
differ
very
widely
in
texas
as
they
do
in
most
states,
justice
brennan,
and
i
think
that
if
a
state
were
do
adopt
district
power
equalizing,
it,
as
a
practical
matter,
would
have
to
adopt
statewide
assessing.
i
don’t
see
any
other
language
the
scheme
would
be
feasible.
otherwise,
you
simply
use
a
favorable
rate
and
you
cheat.
you
get
more
than
you’re
entitled
to,
and
i
think
that
demonstrates
the
further
encouraging
on
local
government
that
the
ideas
presented
here
by
the
appellees
would
represent
that
very
little
is
to
be
left
of
local
government
if
the
decision
bellow
is
to
be
affirmed.
we
contend,
of
course,
that
if
we
are
subject
only
to
the
rational
basis
test
that
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases
in
which
we
must
demonstrate
a
compelling
state
interest
in
order
to
justify
the
results
for
which
we
argue
and
justify
the
state
plan,
and
we
think
that
there’re
quite
a
number
of
very
recent
cases
from
this
court,
some
of
them
ignored
by
the
lower
court
and
some
more
recent,
that
show
exactly
that
and
that
show
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
impose
a
constitutional
straightjacket
on
the
states
in
difficult
and
intractable
questions
of
social
reform,
welfare,
economics.
dandridge,
lindsey,
jefferson
v.
hackney,
cases
of
that
kind
and
we
think
that
this
is
squarely
in
the
area
with
which
we
are
concerned.
the
appellees
undertake
to
distinguish
these
and
to
suggest
that,
in
some
way,
education--
the
educational
needs
of
the
poor
are
fundamental
while
their
needs
for
food
and
for
housing
are
not.
and,
with
respect,
this
is
a
distinction
that
i
think
simply
is
not
a
tenable
one,
that
it
is
hard
to
say
that
a
higher
salaried
school
teacher
is
more
fundamental
to
a
poor
child
than
food
or
a
sunroof
over
his
head.
i
see,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
lunch
hour
is
here.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
time
that
remains
to
me,
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
factual
assumptions
that
underlie
the
judgment
below
and
the
arguments
of
the
appellees.
i
would
like
to
make
perfectly
clear
what
our
position
is
with
regard
to
those
because
there
is
some
suggestion,
particularly
to
the
amicus
briefs
that’s
part
of
the
appellees,
that
texas
is
asking
this
court
to
resolve
the
very
vexing
questions
on
the
relation
of
money
to
quality
and
education
and
on
whether
or
not
persons
who
are
individually
poor
are
not
likely
to
be
found
in
school
districts
that
are
in
terms
of
taxable
property,
collectively
poor.
we,
of
course,
are
not
asking
you
to
settle
those
questions.
our
submission
is
that
these
are
intensely
difficult
questions
on
which
no
answers
in
the
present
state
of
knowledge
are
possible
and
that
this
court
should
not
undertake
to
resolve
matters
on
which
educators
and
social
scientists
cannot
come
up
with
any
answers.
we
had
felt
it
necessary
to
discuss
the
questions
because,
as
we
understand
it,
the
position
of
our
friends
would
require
you
to
resolve
these
issues.
the
decision
below,
though
it
never
discusses
the
issue,
makes
the
implicit
assumption
that,
in
education,
money
is
quality.
now,
the
assumption
is
explicit
in
the
writings
of
professor
coons,
his
associates,
and
others
who
have
written
on
that.
the
district
court
never
spoke
to
it,
but
the
district
court
looked
at
figures
about
numbers
of
dollars
spent
and
then
announced
a
constitutional
requirement
that
the
quality
of
education
cannot
be
allowed
to
vary
except
as
a
function
of
the
wealth
of
the
state
as
a
whole
and,
thus,
implicitly
assumed
what
we
think
no
court
can
safely
assume
because,
in
fact,
we
are
very
skeptical
that
it
is
even
true
that,
beyond
some
minimum,
quality
is
money.
the
district
court
did
explicitly
find
that
there
is
a
correlation
between
poor
people
and
poor
school
districts.
the
finding
of
the
district
court
in
that
regard
is
based
on
the
readings
at
the
extremes
of
a
chart
that
was
offered
in
evidence.
its
determination
in
that
regard
has
been
criticized
not
only
in
our
briefs
and
in
our
testimony
at
the
trial,
but
in
the
literature.
in
our
brief,
we
set
out
the
discussion
of
the
finding
on
that
point
by
professor
goldstein
in
his
article
in
the
pennsylvania
law
review
and
the
issue
of
the
air
log
journal
that
was
published
in
tuesday
of
this
week.
there
is
a
lengthy
student
note
that
is,
again,
very
critical
of
the
finding
in
rodriguez
on
that
point
that
appears
at
page
1312,
notes
40
and
41
of
the
yale
note
and
that
the
subject
has
is
recurred
to
again
at
page
1327
of
the
yale
note
on
why
you
cannot
undertake
to
conclude
a
correlation
between
individual
poverty
and
district
poverty
on
the
basis
of
the
kinds
of
figures
that
the
district
judge
relied
on.
we’ve
presented
also
in
our
briefs
disinterested
studies
elsewhere
in
kansas
and
in
california
that
have
said
“no,
this
relation
does
not
exist.”
the
central
finding
of
the
yale
note
based
on
virtually
complete
data
of
the
entire
state
of
connecticut
and
on
a
far
more
sophisticated
statistical
analysis
than
any
i
have
seen
anywhere
in
the
literature
is
that
there
is
no
such
relation
in
the
state
of
connecticut
that,
indeed,
the
relation
tends
to
be
an
inverse
one,
that
it
is
the
poor
people
who
live
in
the
area
where
the
most
is
being
spent
on
education
and
the
rich
people
live
in
the
areas
where
the
least
is
being
spent
on
education.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
racial
issue
is
in
the--
this
litigation,
yes,
justice
douglas.
it
is
a
major
portion
of
the
plaintiffs’
complaint.
the
trial
court
did
not
rely
on
it
in
its
opinion.
it
put
its
holding
squarely
on
the
dollar
inequality
without
regard
to
whether
the
particular
plaintiffs
were
of
spanish
ancestry
or
anglo
or
black,
but
the
issue
is
certainly
there.
we
think
that
the
issue
is
one
that
is
fairly
readily
answered
that,
although
it
is
of
course
quite
true
that
in
the
edgewood
district
in
bexar
county,
texas
the
great
majority
of
the
students
are
of
spanish
origin
and
not
as
much
money
is
spent
there
as
in
other
school
districts,
but
we
doubt
that
this
would
be
found
to
be
true
as
a
general
matter.
but,
the
poor
school
districts
are
not
that
congruent
with
racial
distributions
that
it
is,
in
other
words,
a
happenstance
that
we
have
a
case
in
which
we
have
particular
plaintiffs
who
are
mexican-american
and
to
live
in
a
district
with
low
taxable
resources.
again,
on
these
factual
statistical
problems,
we
think
that
the
state
of
the
literature
simply
does
not
permit
the
conclusions
that
are
essential
to
the
position
of
my
friend
and
that,
even
their
conclusions
were
sent,
we
still
think
that
our
legal
argument
would
have
great
merit.
but,
if
there
are
conclusions
are
not
demonstrable
at
the
present
time
because
they
are
the
essential
premises
of
result
for
which
they
are
due.
we
think
that
the
inability
to
demonstrate
the
accuracy
of
these
assumptions
is
fatal
to
their
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
exactly
the
sense
in
which
i
use
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think,
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i’d
like
to
begin
to
further
word
on
the
racial
aspects
proposed
by
justice
douglas
in
a
question
to
me
and
also
in
mr.
gochman’s
argument,
in
response
to
that,
simply
quoted
from
a
book
by
professors
coons,
sugarman,
and
clune.
they
say
it
is
not--
the
quotation
appears
on
page
24
of
our
initial
brief.
“it
is
not
surprising
that
even
the
present
litigation
is
understood
by
many
of
its
close
supporters
as
a
racial
struggle.”
the
fact
is,
otherwise,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
the
system
of
district
based
school
finance
embodies
racial
bias.
no
doubt,
there
are
poor
districts
which
are
basically
negro,
but
it
is
basically
clear,
almost
by
definition,
the
vast
preponderance
of
such
districts
is
white.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
but
i
think
that
you
are
bound
to
take
into
account
the
findings
of
serious
students
such
as
professor
coons
in
determining
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
means
on
a
nationwide
basis.
professor
coons
and
his
associates
supported
that
statement,
justice
rehnquist,
by
a
figure
showing
that
in
california,
for
example,
59%
of
minority
students
live
in
districts
in
which
the
assessed
values
are
above
the
medium
and,
therefore,
if
we
had
strict
equalization
they
would
get
less
now.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
i
think
with
respect,
sir,
that
in
determining
the
rule
of
law
that
the
particular
facts
of
the
edgewood
school
district
or
about
california
or
any
other
particular
place
are
all
merely
parts
of
an
overall
mosaic
that
you
must
appraise
in
deciding
does
the
constitution
or
does
it
not
require
this.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
were
allegations
to
that
effect.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
the
judgment
below--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
does
not
rely
on
that,
no.
i’m
not
here
to
apologize
for
the
texas
school
finance
system,
though
i’ve
said
repeatedly,
it
seems
to
me,
far
from
perfect.
i
think
the
texas
system
does
assure,
as
evidence
in
the
record
shows,
more
than
merely
a
minimum.
it
ensures
a
basic
education
to
every
school
child
in
the
state
and
then
lets
districts,
if
they
have
money
and
want
to
spend
money,
go
beyond
that.
as
i
understand,
the
argument
of
my
friend
mr.
gochman,
it
would
not
matter
if
texas
were
giving
each
school
district
$2,000
per
student.
if
alamo
heights
were
still
free
to
tax
with
its
heavy
resources
and
spend
more
than
edgewood
was,
he
would
still
find
this
to
be
impermissible
although,
for
reasons
that
are
not
persuasive
to
me,
he
regards
the
same
result
as
quite
different
if
it
stands
from
district
power
equalizing
than
it
comes
out
of
the
mere
facts
as
they
are.
i
said,
several
times,
in
my
brief,
i
want
to
say
here
and
say
with
the
utmost
sincerity
how
much
i
admire
the
creative
scholarship
of
professor
coons
and
his
associates
and
my
colleague
professor
yudof
and
others
who
are
ripped
in
the
field
and
i
admire
also
the
devotion
and
ability
which
mr.
gochman
has
persevered
in
this
case.
these
people
have
opened
the
eyes
of
the
whole
country
to
a
very
serious
problem.
i
think
that
everyone
in
this
courtroom
would
agree
that
what
we
want
is
better
education
for
all
children
and
especially
for
poor
children,
that
the
real
differences
between
us
are
whether
a
new
system
should
be
adopted
because
this
court
finds
that
the
constitution
requires
it
or
whether
we
look
to
legislatures
to
provide
remedies,
and
the
difference
about
whether
the
proposals
they
make
would,
indeed,
lead
to
better
education
or
only
more
expensive
education,
whether
they
would
relieve
poor
children
or
only
children
who
happen
to
live
in
poor
school
districts.
and,
indeed,
if
district
power
equalizing
is
to
be
taken
seriously,
whether
the
remedy
that
has
been
offered
here
is
not
one
that
is
of
no
benefit
to
children
but
only
of
benefit
to
taxpayers.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
