mr.
arthur
gochman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
below
held
the
texas
system
unconstitutional
because
it
distributes
educational
benefits
on
the
basis
of
district
wealth.
the
court
said,
as
might
be
expected,
those
districts
much--
most
rich
in
property
also
have
the
highest
median
family
income
and
the
lowest
percentage
of
minority
pupils,
while
the
poor
districts
are
poor
in
income
and
predominantly
minority
in
composition,
and
the
court
cites
one
of
the
exhibits.
another
one
is
on
page
98
of
the
appendix.
it
pertains
to
exhibit
3
which
shows
that
the
correlation
is
not
only
on
a
district
basis
of
minority
discrimination,
but
on
statewide--
on
a
statewide
basis.
the
court
further
found
that
there
was
no
rational
or
compelling
reason
that
could
be
offered
for
this
invidious
discrimination.
this
court
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
reverse
the
lower
court
and
approve
district
wealth
as
a
proper
basis
for
distributing
public
school
education.
the
defendants
admit
that
there
is
a
perfect
correlation
between
a
property
tax
base
per
student
and
the
amount
of
dollars
each
child
gets
for
his
education.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
tax
rates
do
vary
in
texas,
but
the
district’s
taxing
at
the
highest
rates
in
texas
get
the
lowest
dollars
per
pupil,
and
the
district’s
taxing
at
the
lowest
rates
gets
the
highest
dollars
per
pupil
and
we
showed
it
in
exhibits,
in
bexar
county
where
my
clients
live,
a
metropolitan
area,
and
we
showed
it
statewide.
mr.
arthur
gochman
that
is
not
what
i
just
said
a
moment
ago,
but
there
is.
the
record
shows
it
to
this
extent.
as
to
the
poorest
districts
and
the
richest
districts,
the
poorest
people
live
in
the
poorest
districts
and
the
richest
people
live
in
the
richest
districts,
and
in
bexar
county
it
perfectly
correlates.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
your
honor.
it’s
not,
but
we
probably
wouldn’t
have
a
lawsuit
if
it
wasn’t
that
way
because
it
falls--
this
kind
of
a
discrimination
falls
most
heavily
on
the
poor.
the
poor
have
nowhere
to
go.
edgewood
is
a
barrio
district.
mr.
arthur
gochman
there
are
probably
some
accidents
like
that
in
texas
but,
in
the
west
orange
case
which
we
cite
in
our
motion
to
affirm,
we
show
how
they
do
away
with
that
happening
in
texas
by
poor
people
being
in
a
district
begets
all
of
the
oil
refineries.
what
happened
in
orange,
the
big
majority
district
dissolved
itself
and
then
got
itself
attached
to
the
poor
district,
the
poor
people,
with
the
great
wealth
and
attached
itself
to
the
district
with
poor
families
and
great
wealth.
there
is
some
of
that
in
texas,
but
as
a
whole
and
especially
at
the
top
or
the
bottom,
the
richest
districts
have
the
least
poor
people
and
the
least
minorities,
and
the
poorest
districts
have
the
most
poor
people
and
the
most
minorities.
mr.
arthur
gochman
it
doesn’t
hold
true
in
the
middle,
but
in
bexar
county
where
my
clients
live,
your
honor,
it
hold
true
perfectly
up
and
down
the
line.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor.
in
our
brief,
on
page
12,
if
you
go
to
property
tax
and
then
the
medium
per
capita
income,
they
correlate
perfectly
up
and
down
the
line.
these
seven
school
districts
have
93%
of
the
students
in
bexar
county.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
your
honor.
i
carry
the
equal
protection
clause
to
be
“no
state
shall”
and
it’s
the
state’s
obligation.
the
state
has
set
up
this
school
system.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
i
think
we’re
talking
about--
mr.
arthur
gochman
as
a
moral
proposition,
maybe
so.
mr.
arthur
gochman
but
this
is
a
state.
it’s
now
a
state
function,
not
a
federal
function.
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
think--
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
think
what’s
important
is
the
constitutional
importance
of
education,
that
is,
education
affects
matters
guaranteed
by
the
bill
of
rights.
it’s
preservative
of
other
rights.
unlike
some
of
these
other
services,
it’s
related
to
every
important
right
we
have.
it’s
related
to
the
right
to
vote,
speech,
jury
service.
on
a
federal
jury,
you
can’t
serve
if
you
can’t
read,
write,
understand,
and
speak
the
english
language.
it’s
education.
this
court
has
used
as
the
high
watermark
for
measuring
the
importance
of
other
rights,
for
example,
in
measuring
the
importance
of
travel.
in
restricting
the
poor
on
travel,
the
court
said
you
couldn’t
pose
the
schools
to
the
board,
raising
the
importance
of
travel
to
that
level.
and,
mr.
justice
blackmun
concurring
in
palmer
says
“nice
to
have
everything,
but
you
can’t
compare
them
to
education.”
mr.
arthur
gochman
public
health,
food,
lodging,
those
things
are
of
great
economic
importance
but
they’re
not
matters
that
are
related
to
those
things
guaranteed
by
the
bill
of
rights,
and
any
importance
educationalized
at
the
eight
pegs
up
and
down
the
ladder.
it’s
important
to
the
free
enterprise
system,
to
the
individual
not
to
be
poor.
it’s
important
to
feel
indivi--
fulfill
individual
potential.
it’s
universally
relevant
and
it’s
the
only
thing
the
state
provides
that
it
compels
you
to
utilize
for
this
period
of
time.
in
fact,
i
don’t
know
anything
it
compels
you
to
utilize
for
any
length
of
time,
but
a
child
has
to
go
to
school
for
10
years.
that’s
the
importance
the
state
puts
on.
it
molds
the
character
and
the
personality
of
the
individual
and
it’s
vital
for
the
united
states
to
compete
in
the
world.
but,
they
have
sought
to
rationalize
this
and
say
it’s
alright
on
the
basis
of
local
control,
on
the
basis
of
diversity,
variety,
independence.
the
one
thing
the
texas
system
does
not
have
because
those
that
tax
at
the
highest
rates,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
have
the
lowest
expenditures
per
pupil
and
those
that
tax
at
the
lowest
rate,
have
the
highest
expenditures
per
pupil.
there
is
just
the
reverse
of
local
control.
in
san
antonio,
edgewood
taxes
at
a
rate
20%
higher
than
alamo
heights,
but
they
raised
$30-some
a
pupil.
alamo
heights
raises
over
$400
a
pupil.
it
is
the
property
tax
base
that
determines
how
much
you
have
for
a
child’s
education
and
who
set
that
base,
and
who
set
that
standard?
the
state,
and
they
agree
that
this
is
a
state
system
of
public
school
education
and
these
school
districts
were
set
up
by
the
state
for
the
convenience
of
the
state
in
affording
public
school
education.
they
also
agree
that
these
district
boundaries
serve
it
no
educational
function
and
they
have
no
rational
basis.
mr.
arthur
gochman
we
show
that
it
really
doesn’t
provide
any
minimum.
the
minimum
is
what
the
school
at
the
bottom
gets.
for
example,
he
says
it
guarantees
you
media--
instructional
media,
but
if
you
look
at
section
k
of
the
statute,
it
says
if
you
put
up
the
matching
funds,
it
guarantees
it.
and,
that’s
why
edgewood
gets
lesser
funds
from
the
state
program
than
alamo
heights
but,
in
addition
to
that,
what
is
a
minimum?
what
kind
of
a
“more
as”
is
mr.
wright
asking
you
to
get
into?
what
is
a
minimum?
is
a
minimum
giving
him
the
second
grade
or
giving
him
12
years
when
he
comes
out
at
the
end
equal
to
an
alamo
heights’
second
grade?
are
we
going
to
have
two
classes
of
citizens,
minimum
opportunity
citizens
and
first
class
citizens?
i
think
in
sweatt
we
took
care
of
that,
and
i
think
in
mclaurin
we
took
care
of
that.
if
we’re
going
apply
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
to
get
into
minimums
is
going
to
get
us
into
a
thicket
that
we’d
have
to
work
our
way
around.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
and
i
say
that,
i
pled
that,
and
we
proved
that
but,
additionally,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
once
the
state
provides
the
service,
it
has
to
provide
it
all
on
equal
terms.
it--
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
for
example,
take
this
problem.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor,
but
if
it’s
not
just
flat
based
on
wealth.
the
perfect
correlation
here
is
that
the
input
that
you
get
in
is
based
on
what
your
tax
base
is
and
nothing
else.
mr.
arthur
gochman
for
no
reason?
well,
it--
i
would
say
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
claus,
but
let’s
say
it
had
a
program--
mr.
arthur
gochman
one
would
be,
i
would
think,
power
equalizing
could
be
sustained
because
it
does
give
effective
local
control
and
it
does--
is
this--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
we’re
not
preaching
against
disparities
in
education.
mr.
arthur
gochman
well,
as
low
as
the
lo--
as
long
as
there
is
an
equal
opportunity
for
education
or
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
disparity,
let
it
be
on
a
program
basis.
if
a
school
says
that
we
want
to--
if
a
state
says
“we
want
to
subsidize
people
more
that
go
into
the
sciences,”
and
one
school
is
heavy
in
sciences
and
they
get
more
from
the
state
because
science
is
more
expensive
to
teach,
there
would
be
some
reason
for
that
diversity
but,
here,
it--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes.
mr.
arthur
gochman
by
taxing
at
a
higher
rate.
mr.
arthur
gochman
as
long
as
the
500
provided
some,
what
you
would
say
would
be,
minimum.
the
compelling
basis
for
that,
if
it
is
to
be
sustained,
and
i’m
not
preaching
for
power
equalizing
because
that’s
not
what
texas
is
looking
at.
texas
is
working
on
putting
in
a
new
program,
but
you’d
have
to
compare
that
to
james
versus
vouch
here,
your
honor,
and
say
that
this
gives
the
opportunity,
a
real
genuine
opportunity
for
the
people
in
the
area
to
determine
their
own
destiny.
mr.
arthur
gochman
on
some
basis,
yes.
when
there’s
a
compelling
interest--
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
i
can’t
say
that
there’s
any
such
thing
as
a
minimum.
i
would
say
that
that
has
to--
if
it’s
an
educational--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
system--
edgewood
is
a
body,
for
example,
95%
mexican-american,
average
per
capita
income
of
$101,000.
in
the
other
system,
we
wouldn’t
have
a
lawsuit.
a
person
can
move
from
one
district
to
the
other
but,
here,
the
poor
are
stuck
in
the
poor
district
and
they
have
no
mobility.
the
edgewood
people
would
like
to
live
in
alamo
heights,
but
they
have
no
way
to
do
it
and
the
only
way
they
can
get
a
fair
education
is
to
get
out
of
edgewood.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
what
i’m
saying
is--
and
we’re
getting
into
the
constitutionality
or
lack
of
constitutionality
of
this
power
equalizing
system.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor.
one
thing
they’re
looking
at
in
texas,
for
example,
is
you
take
all
of
the
non-residential
wealth
and
you
tax
it
statewide
and
you
tax
the
residential
wealth
on
a
countywide
basis,
and
taxing
this
residential
wealth
on
a
countywide
basis,
each
district,
by
improving
its
own
tax
rate,
will
get
itself
more
money.
but,
there
is
a
basis
because
pretty
well,
on
a
countywide
basis
throughout
the
state,
the
residential
tax
basis
will
be
equal
or
the
variance
will
relate
to
the
higher
cost
of
living.
mr.
arthur
gochman
exactly.
mr.
arthur
gochman
exactly
right,
discrimination
is
based
on
wealth.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
because
the
discrimination
would
not
be
based
on
wealth
and
if
you’re
going
to
justify
power
equalization--
mr.
arthur
gochman
well,
the
variances,
your
honor,
under
the
present
system
are
so
vast
that
i
can’t
imagine
any
system
and,
as
dr.
berke
testified,
no
one
can
imagine
any
system
having
vast
or
disparities.
over
half
of
the
teachers
in
edgewood
are
unqualified,
according
to
state
standards,
to
teach
school.
there
are
28
teachers
per
student
in
edgewood,
but--
mr.
arthur
gochman
he
testified,
your
honor.
what
happened
is
we
put
out
his
direct
testimony
in
narrative
form
and
attached
it
to
a
question
on
interrogatory.
all
the
evidence
was
taken
by
depositions
and
interrogatories
and
he
actually
testified
by
interrogatories.
mr.
arthur
gochman
that’s
right.
there
was
no
courtroom
testimony.
the
court
asked
us
to
take
all
our
testimony
by
depositions.
there
are
three
times
the
number
of
councilors
per
student
in
northeast
as
there
is
in
edgewood,
2
miles
away.
the
curriculum
is
much
broader
and
dr.
cardenas,
the
superintendent
of
the
edgewood
school
district,
says
he
can’t
afford
to
come
near
the
curriculum
they
have
in
this
neighboring
school
district.
the
turnover
of
teachers
in
edgewood
is
50%
a
year.
the
turnover
statewide
in
the
governor’s
report
is
20%
a
year.
the
schools
have
to
be
poorly
maintained
because
they
don’t
have
the
money
to
maintain
it.
they
have
leaky
roofs.
they
have
one-and-a
half
times
as
much
space
per
student
and
a
school
district
2
miles
away--
mr.
arthur
gochman
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
gochman
that’s
right.
it’s
taxing
at
the
highest
rate
in
the
county
and
that
order.
to
get
out
of
it,
it
would
have
to
tax
10-12
times
that
present
rate,
which
is
prohibited.
they’re
poor
anyway.
mr.
arthur
gochman
if
the
discrimi--
if
it
wasn’t
locked
in
on
the
basis
of
wealth
and
there
was
some
rational
and
compelling
state
reason
involved--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
gochman
well,
i’d
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
edgewood
chose
to
go
that
way
and
had
the
opportunity
to
do
something
else.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
but
that
is
not
likely
the
system.
the
system
is--
mr.
arthur
gochman
pardon?
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes.[laughter]
yes,
we’re
facing
that
here
and
we
think
that
if
local
control
is
that
important,
that
if
they
decided
to
do
it
that
way--
mr.
arthur
gochman
well,
i
think
that
has
to
be
determined
at
a
later
time.
i
can
tell
the
court
it
won’t
be
determined
on
the
texas
financing
system
because
texas,
which
has
been
working
on
a
new
system
since
the
trial
court
decision,
is
not
considering
this.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
if
the
compelling
interest
of
local
control
is
that
strong
then
you
could
have
that
kind
of
discrimination,
that
the
people
in
an
area
can
decide
for
themselves
whether
they
want
to
lock
themselves
in
to
a
poor
school
system.
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
would
think
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
but
it
would
have
a
different
basis
at
least.
it
wouldn’t
lock
on
to
the
poor
as
it
does
now,
and
mobility
is
a
serious
factor
in
this
case.
if
this
was
a
rich
guy
in
a
poor
district,
we
wouldn’t
be
in
court.
he’d
just
move.
but,
the
poor
have
no
way
out
of
the
present
system.
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
think--
yes,
i
think
the
factual
situation
is
poor
or
there
wouldn’t
be
any
lawsuit
the
facts--
if
the
facts
weren’t
there.
we
say
the
discrimination
is
based
upon
the
wealth
of
the
districts,
but
we
say
that
that
discrimination
falls
most
heavily
upon
the
poor
and
the
minorities
and,
in
that
regard,
in
the
race--
with
regard
to
the
racial
discrimination,
this
is
not
segregation
where
you
happen
to
prove
that
the
segregation
discriminates.
the
discrimination
is
there
on
its
face
that
the
minorities
get
last
both
in
bexar
county
and
statewide.
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
contend
that,
objectively,
texas
did
what
it
did
and
it
could
have
done
something
else.
and,
what
it
did
discriminates
against
minorities
and
that--
mr.
arthur
gochman
exactly,
we
had
to
face
jefferson
versus
hackney
and
we
say
it’s
distinguished
because
of
the
importance
of
education,
because
it
falls
on
helpless
children,
and
because
the
state
created
the
discrimination.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor,
welfare--
but
on
the
other
two
grounds,
the
importance
of
education
as
it
relates
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
fact
that--
i
lost
my
train
of
thought
on
that.
the
importance
of
education
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
fact
that
the
state
did
it,
the
state
made
these
districts
poor,
are
two
distinctions
of
jefferson
versus
hackney.
as
to
the--
mr.
arthur
gochman
no.
the
state
setup
the
system
for
the
convenience
of
the
state,
but
the
boundaries
are
adjusted
by
majority
votes
for
joining
districts
and
by
the
county
board
of
trustees,
if
it’s
a
county
district.
but,
the
problem
is
nobody
is
going
to
join
up
with
edgewood.
from
san
antonio
independent
school
district
to
the
central
city
school
district,
the
evidence
will
show,
continually
took
in
neighboring
districts,
but
it’s
not
going
to
the
body
of
the
majority
of
the
people
in
san
antonio
vote
to
take
it
in
and,
thereby,
san
antonio
independent
school
district,
the
central
city
just
has
four
times
the
wealth
per
student
of
edgewood.
it
would
injure
its
ability
to
teach
its
present
students
by
having
an
election
to
decide
to
take
in
edgewood
and,
in
that
way,
the
state
has
locked
in
edgewood.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no.
basically,
this
is
the
job
of
majorities
in
the
adjoining
school
districts
at
their
independent
school
districts
and
if
they’re
county
school
districts,
the
county
board
of
school
trustees
are
obviously--
mr.
arthur
gochman
it’s
“bear,”
yes.
mr.
arthur
gochman
there
are
about
15,
but
some
of
them
go
into
other
county
lines.
the
seven
that
we
names
in
the
suit--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
sir.
the
seven
that
we
named
in
the
suit
have
93%
of
the
students.
one
thing
they’re
asking
you
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
declare
constitutional
a
system
that
is
based
on
money
making
a
difference
and
giving
incentive
matching
grants
to
those
schools
that
have
the
most
money
and
put
up
the
most
money
for
education,
and
ask
you
to
declare
that
system
to
be
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
money
makes
no
difference.
actually,
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
they
all
agreed
that
money
made
some
difference
and
money
made
the
difference.
now,
they
say
that
a
minimum
program
is
enough,
which
is
an
admission
that
money
must
make
a
difference,
that
there
must
be
a
maximum
program
but,
again,
i
want
to
go
into
the
fact
that
sweatt,
i
think,
did
away
with
minimums.
and,
i
want
to
point
the
court
to
mclaurin
because
this
is
what
the
state
did
and
it’s
not--
what
will
happen
is
a
result
that
counts
in
mclaurin.
the
state
of
oklahoma
said
this
child
shall
sit
in
the
back
of
the
room.
this
law
student
shall
sit
in
the
back
of
the
room,
and
they
wanted
to
justify
it
in
court
by
saying
“well,
nobody
else
would’ve
sat
with
him
anyway.
so,
the
statute
ought
to
be
upheld
because
it
wouldn’t
be
any
different
if
we
didn’t
have
it.”
and,
the
court
said
what
the
state
did
is
what
is
important.
i
want
to
say,
in
concluding,
that
the
san
antonio
independent
school
district,
the
central
city
school
district
was
the
named
defendant--
a
named
defendant
in
this
case
and
they
fought
as
hard
at
the
trial
level,
got
out
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
but,
on
appeal
of
this
case,
after
seeing
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
and
the
equity
involved
in
the
vast
discriminations,
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
the
decision
of
the
trial
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arthur
gochman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
below
held
the
texas
system
unconstitutional
because
it
distributes
educational
benefits
on
the
basis
of
district
wealth.
the
court
said,
as
might
be
expected,
those
districts
much--
most
rich
in
property
also
have
the
highest
median
family
income
and
the
lowest
percentage
of
minority
pupils,
while
the
poor
districts
are
poor
in
income
and
predominantly
minority
in
composition,
and
the
court
cites
one
of
the
exhibits.
another
one
is
on
page
98
of
the
appendix.
it
pertains
to
exhibit
3
which
shows
that
the
correlation
is
not
only
on
a
district
basis
of
minority
discrimination,
but
on
statewide--
on
a
statewide
basis.
the
court
further
found
that
there
was
no
rational
or
compelling
reason
that
could
be
offered
for
this
invidious
discrimination.
this
court
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
reverse
the
lower
court
and
approve
district
wealth
as
a
proper
basis
for
distributing
public
school
education.
the
defendants
admit
that
there
is
a
perfect
correlation
between
a
property
tax
base
per
student
and
the
amount
of
dollars
each
child
gets
for
his
education.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
tax
rates
do
vary
in
texas,
but
the
district’s
taxing
at
the
highest
rates
in
texas
get
the
lowest
dollars
per
pupil,
and
the
district’s
taxing
at
the
lowest
rates
gets
the
highest
dollars
per
pupil
and
we
showed
it
in
exhibits,
in
bexar
county
where
my
clients
live,
a
metropolitan
area,
and
we
showed
it
statewide.
mr.
arthur
gochman
that
is
not
what
i
just
said
a
moment
ago,
but
there
is.
the
record
shows
it
to
this
extent.
as
to
the
poorest
districts
and
the
richest
districts,
the
poorest
people
live
in
the
poorest
districts
and
the
richest
people
live
in
the
richest
districts,
and
in
bexar
county
it
perfectly
correlates.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
your
honor.
it’s
not,
but
we
probably
wouldn’t
have
a
lawsuit
if
it
wasn’t
that
way
because
it
falls--
this
kind
of
a
discrimination
falls
most
heavily
on
the
poor.
the
poor
have
nowhere
to
go.
edgewood
is
a
barrio
district.
mr.
arthur
gochman
there
are
probably
some
accidents
like
that
in
texas
but,
in
the
west
orange
case
which
we
cite
in
our
motion
to
affirm,
we
show
how
they
do
away
with
that
happening
in
texas
by
poor
people
being
in
a
district
begets
all
of
the
oil
refineries.
what
happened
in
orange,
the
big
majority
district
dissolved
itself
and
then
got
itself
attached
to
the
poor
district,
the
poor
people,
with
the
great
wealth
and
attached
itself
to
the
district
with
poor
families
and
great
wealth.
there
is
some
of
that
in
texas,
but
as
a
whole
and
especially
at
the
top
or
the
bottom,
the
richest
districts
have
the
least
poor
people
and
the
least
minorities,
and
the
poorest
districts
have
the
most
poor
people
and
the
most
minorities.
mr.
arthur
gochman
it
doesn’t
hold
true
in
the
middle,
but
in
bexar
county
where
my
clients
live,
your
honor,
it
hold
true
perfectly
up
and
down
the
line.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor.
in
our
brief,
on
page
12,
if
you
go
to
property
tax
and
then
the
medium
per
capita
income,
they
correlate
perfectly
up
and
down
the
line.
these
seven
school
districts
have
93%
of
the
students
in
bexar
county.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
your
honor.
i
carry
the
equal
protection
clause
to
be
“no
state
shall”
and
it’s
the
state’s
obligation.
the
state
has
set
up
this
school
system.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
i
think
we’re
talking
about--
mr.
arthur
gochman
as
a
moral
proposition,
maybe
so.
mr.
arthur
gochman
but
this
is
a
state.
it’s
now
a
state
function,
not
a
federal
function.
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
think--
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
think
what’s
important
is
the
constitutional
importance
of
education,
that
is,
education
affects
matters
guaranteed
by
the
bill
of
rights.
it’s
preservative
of
other
rights.
unlike
some
of
these
other
services,
it’s
related
to
every
important
right
we
have.
it’s
related
to
the
right
to
vote,
speech,
jury
service.
on
a
federal
jury,
you
can’t
serve
if
you
can’t
read,
write,
understand,
and
speak
the
english
language.
it’s
education.
this
court
has
used
as
the
high
watermark
for
measuring
the
importance
of
other
rights,
for
example,
in
measuring
the
importance
of
travel.
in
restricting
the
poor
on
travel,
the
court
said
you
couldn’t
pose
the
schools
to
the
board,
raising
the
importance
of
travel
to
that
level.
and,
mr.
justice
blackmun
concurring
in
palmer
says
“nice
to
have
everything,
but
you
can’t
compare
them
to
education.”
mr.
arthur
gochman
public
health,
food,
lodging,
those
things
are
of
great
economic
importance
but
they’re
not
matters
that
are
related
to
those
things
guaranteed
by
the
bill
of
rights,
and
any
importance
educationalized
at
the
eight
pegs
up
and
down
the
ladder.
it’s
important
to
the
free
enterprise
system,
to
the
individual
not
to
be
poor.
it’s
important
to
feel
indivi--
fulfill
individual
potential.
it’s
universally
relevant
and
it’s
the
only
thing
the
state
provides
that
it
compels
you
to
utilize
for
this
period
of
time.
in
fact,
i
don’t
know
anything
it
compels
you
to
utilize
for
any
length
of
time,
but
a
child
has
to
go
to
school
for
10
years.
that’s
the
importance
the
state
puts
on.
it
molds
the
character
and
the
personality
of
the
individual
and
it’s
vital
for
the
united
states
to
compete
in
the
world.
but,
they
have
sought
to
rationalize
this
and
say
it’s
alright
on
the
basis
of
local
control,
on
the
basis
of
diversity,
variety,
independence.
the
one
thing
the
texas
system
does
not
have
because
those
that
tax
at
the
highest
rates,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
have
the
lowest
expenditures
per
pupil
and
those
that
tax
at
the
lowest
rate,
have
the
highest
expenditures
per
pupil.
there
is
just
the
reverse
of
local
control.
in
san
antonio,
edgewood
taxes
at
a
rate
20%
higher
than
alamo
heights,
but
they
raised
$30-some
a
pupil.
alamo
heights
raises
over
$400
a
pupil.
it
is
the
property
tax
base
that
determines
how
much
you
have
for
a
child’s
education
and
who
set
that
base,
and
who
set
that
standard?
the
state,
and
they
agree
that
this
is
a
state
system
of
public
school
education
and
these
school
districts
were
set
up
by
the
state
for
the
convenience
of
the
state
in
affording
public
school
education.
they
also
agree
that
these
district
boundaries
serve
it
no
educational
function
and
they
have
no
rational
basis.
mr.
arthur
gochman
we
show
that
it
really
doesn’t
provide
any
minimum.
the
minimum
is
what
the
school
at
the
bottom
gets.
for
example,
he
says
it
guarantees
you
media--
instructional
media,
but
if
you
look
at
section
k
of
the
statute,
it
says
if
you
put
up
the
matching
funds,
it
guarantees
it.
and,
that’s
why
edgewood
gets
lesser
funds
from
the
state
program
than
alamo
heights
but,
in
addition
to
that,
what
is
a
minimum?
what
kind
of
a
“more
as”
is
mr.
wright
asking
you
to
get
into?
what
is
a
minimum?
is
a
minimum
giving
him
the
second
grade
or
giving
him
12
years
when
he
comes
out
at
the
end
equal
to
an
alamo
heights’
second
grade?
are
we
going
to
have
two
classes
of
citizens,
minimum
opportunity
citizens
and
first
class
citizens?
i
think
in
sweatt
we
took
care
of
that,
and
i
think
in
mclaurin
we
took
care
of
that.
if
we’re
going
apply
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
to
get
into
minimums
is
going
to
get
us
into
a
thicket
that
we’d
have
to
work
our
way
around.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
and
i
say
that,
i
pled
that,
and
we
proved
that
but,
additionally,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
once
the
state
provides
the
service,
it
has
to
provide
it
all
on
equal
terms.
it--
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
for
example,
take
this
problem.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor,
but
if
it’s
not
just
flat
based
on
wealth.
the
perfect
correlation
here
is
that
the
input
that
you
get
in
is
based
on
what
your
tax
base
is
and
nothing
else.
mr.
arthur
gochman
for
no
reason?
well,
it--
i
would
say
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
claus,
but
let’s
say
it
had
a
program--
mr.
arthur
gochman
one
would
be,
i
would
think,
power
equalizing
could
be
sustained
because
it
does
give
effective
local
control
and
it
does--
is
this--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
we’re
not
preaching
against
disparities
in
education.
mr.
arthur
gochman
well,
as
low
as
the
lo--
as
long
as
there
is
an
equal
opportunity
for
education
or
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
disparity,
let
it
be
on
a
program
basis.
if
a
school
says
that
we
want
to--
if
a
state
says
“we
want
to
subsidize
people
more
that
go
into
the
sciences,”
and
one
school
is
heavy
in
sciences
and
they
get
more
from
the
state
because
science
is
more
expensive
to
teach,
there
would
be
some
reason
for
that
diversity
but,
here,
it--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes.
mr.
arthur
gochman
by
taxing
at
a
higher
rate.
mr.
arthur
gochman
as
long
as
the
500
provided
some,
what
you
would
say
would
be,
minimum.
the
compelling
basis
for
that,
if
it
is
to
be
sustained,
and
i’m
not
preaching
for
power
equalizing
because
that’s
not
what
texas
is
looking
at.
texas
is
working
on
putting
in
a
new
program,
but
you’d
have
to
compare
that
to
james
versus
vouch
here,
your
honor,
and
say
that
this
gives
the
opportunity,
a
real
genuine
opportunity
for
the
people
in
the
area
to
determine
their
own
destiny.
mr.
arthur
gochman
on
some
basis,
yes.
when
there’s
a
compelling
interest--
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
i
can’t
say
that
there’s
any
such
thing
as
a
minimum.
i
would
say
that
that
has
to--
if
it’s
an
educational--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
system--
edgewood
is
a
body,
for
example,
95%
mexican-american,
average
per
capita
income
of
$101,000.
in
the
other
system,
we
wouldn’t
have
a
lawsuit.
a
person
can
move
from
one
district
to
the
other
but,
here,
the
poor
are
stuck
in
the
poor
district
and
they
have
no
mobility.
the
edgewood
people
would
like
to
live
in
alamo
heights,
but
they
have
no
way
to
do
it
and
the
only
way
they
can
get
a
fair
education
is
to
get
out
of
edgewood.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
what
i’m
saying
is--
and
we’re
getting
into
the
constitutionality
or
lack
of
constitutionality
of
this
power
equalizing
system.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor.
one
thing
they’re
looking
at
in
texas,
for
example,
is
you
take
all
of
the
non-residential
wealth
and
you
tax
it
statewide
and
you
tax
the
residential
wealth
on
a
countywide
basis,
and
taxing
this
residential
wealth
on
a
countywide
basis,
each
district,
by
improving
its
own
tax
rate,
will
get
itself
more
money.
but,
there
is
a
basis
because
pretty
well,
on
a
countywide
basis
throughout
the
state,
the
residential
tax
basis
will
be
equal
or
the
variance
will
relate
to
the
higher
cost
of
living.
mr.
arthur
gochman
exactly.
mr.
arthur
gochman
exactly
right,
discrimination
is
based
on
wealth.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
because
the
discrimination
would
not
be
based
on
wealth
and
if
you’re
going
to
justify
power
equalization--
mr.
arthur
gochman
well,
the
variances,
your
honor,
under
the
present
system
are
so
vast
that
i
can’t
imagine
any
system
and,
as
dr.
berke
testified,
no
one
can
imagine
any
system
having
vast
or
disparities.
over
half
of
the
teachers
in
edgewood
are
unqualified,
according
to
state
standards,
to
teach
school.
there
are
28
teachers
per
student
in
edgewood,
but--
mr.
arthur
gochman
he
testified,
your
honor.
what
happened
is
we
put
out
his
direct
testimony
in
narrative
form
and
attached
it
to
a
question
on
interrogatory.
all
the
evidence
was
taken
by
depositions
and
interrogatories
and
he
actually
testified
by
interrogatories.
mr.
arthur
gochman
that’s
right.
there
was
no
courtroom
testimony.
the
court
asked
us
to
take
all
our
testimony
by
depositions.
there
are
three
times
the
number
of
councilors
per
student
in
northeast
as
there
is
in
edgewood,
2
miles
away.
the
curriculum
is
much
broader
and
dr.
cardenas,
the
superintendent
of
the
edgewood
school
district,
says
he
can’t
afford
to
come
near
the
curriculum
they
have
in
this
neighboring
school
district.
the
turnover
of
teachers
in
edgewood
is
50%
a
year.
the
turnover
statewide
in
the
governor’s
report
is
20%
a
year.
the
schools
have
to
be
poorly
maintained
because
they
don’t
have
the
money
to
maintain
it.
they
have
leaky
roofs.
they
have
one-and-a
half
times
as
much
space
per
student
and
a
school
district
2
miles
away--
mr.
arthur
gochman
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
gochman
that’s
right.
it’s
taxing
at
the
highest
rate
in
the
county
and
that
order.
to
get
out
of
it,
it
would
have
to
tax
10-12
times
that
present
rate,
which
is
prohibited.
they’re
poor
anyway.
mr.
arthur
gochman
if
the
discrimi--
if
it
wasn’t
locked
in
on
the
basis
of
wealth
and
there
was
some
rational
and
compelling
state
reason
involved--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
gochman
well,
i’d
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
edgewood
chose
to
go
that
way
and
had
the
opportunity
to
do
something
else.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
but
that
is
not
likely
the
system.
the
system
is--
mr.
arthur
gochman
pardon?
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes.[laughter]
yes,
we’re
facing
that
here
and
we
think
that
if
local
control
is
that
important,
that
if
they
decided
to
do
it
that
way--
mr.
arthur
gochman
well,
i
think
that
has
to
be
determined
at
a
later
time.
i
can
tell
the
court
it
won’t
be
determined
on
the
texas
financing
system
because
texas,
which
has
been
working
on
a
new
system
since
the
trial
court
decision,
is
not
considering
this.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no,
if
the
compelling
interest
of
local
control
is
that
strong
then
you
could
have
that
kind
of
discrimination,
that
the
people
in
an
area
can
decide
for
themselves
whether
they
want
to
lock
themselves
in
to
a
poor
school
system.
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
would
think
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
but
it
would
have
a
different
basis
at
least.
it
wouldn’t
lock
on
to
the
poor
as
it
does
now,
and
mobility
is
a
serious
factor
in
this
case.
if
this
was
a
rich
guy
in
a
poor
district,
we
wouldn’t
be
in
court.
he’d
just
move.
but,
the
poor
have
no
way
out
of
the
present
system.
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
think--
yes,
i
think
the
factual
situation
is
poor
or
there
wouldn’t
be
any
lawsuit
the
facts--
if
the
facts
weren’t
there.
we
say
the
discrimination
is
based
upon
the
wealth
of
the
districts,
but
we
say
that
that
discrimination
falls
most
heavily
upon
the
poor
and
the
minorities
and,
in
that
regard,
in
the
race--
with
regard
to
the
racial
discrimination,
this
is
not
segregation
where
you
happen
to
prove
that
the
segregation
discriminates.
the
discrimination
is
there
on
its
face
that
the
minorities
get
last
both
in
bexar
county
and
statewide.
mr.
arthur
gochman
i
contend
that,
objectively,
texas
did
what
it
did
and
it
could
have
done
something
else.
and,
what
it
did
discriminates
against
minorities
and
that--
mr.
arthur
gochman
exactly,
we
had
to
face
jefferson
versus
hackney
and
we
say
it’s
distinguished
because
of
the
importance
of
education,
because
it
falls
on
helpless
children,
and
because
the
state
created
the
discrimination.
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
your
honor,
welfare--
but
on
the
other
two
grounds,
the
importance
of
education
as
it
relates
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
fact
that--
i
lost
my
train
of
thought
on
that.
the
importance
of
education
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
fact
that
the
state
did
it,
the
state
made
these
districts
poor,
are
two
distinctions
of
jefferson
versus
hackney.
as
to
the--
mr.
arthur
gochman
no.
the
state
setup
the
system
for
the
convenience
of
the
state,
but
the
boundaries
are
adjusted
by
majority
votes
for
joining
districts
and
by
the
county
board
of
trustees,
if
it’s
a
county
district.
but,
the
problem
is
nobody
is
going
to
join
up
with
edgewood.
from
san
antonio
independent
school
district
to
the
central
city
school
district,
the
evidence
will
show,
continually
took
in
neighboring
districts,
but
it’s
not
going
to
the
body
of
the
majority
of
the
people
in
san
antonio
vote
to
take
it
in
and,
thereby,
san
antonio
independent
school
district,
the
central
city
just
has
four
times
the
wealth
per
student
of
edgewood.
it
would
injure
its
ability
to
teach
its
present
students
by
having
an
election
to
decide
to
take
in
edgewood
and,
in
that
way,
the
state
has
locked
in
edgewood.
mr.
arthur
gochman
no.
basically,
this
is
the
job
of
majorities
in
the
adjoining
school
districts
at
their
independent
school
districts
and
if
they’re
county
school
districts,
the
county
board
of
school
trustees
are
obviously--
mr.
arthur
gochman
it’s
“bear,”
yes.
mr.
arthur
gochman
there
are
about
15,
but
some
of
them
go
into
other
county
lines.
the
seven
that
we
names
in
the
suit--
mr.
arthur
gochman
yes,
sir.
the
seven
that
we
named
in
the
suit
have
93%
of
the
students.
one
thing
they’re
asking
you
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
declare
constitutional
a
system
that
is
based
on
money
making
a
difference
and
giving
incentive
matching
grants
to
those
schools
that
have
the
most
money
and
put
up
the
most
money
for
education,
and
ask
you
to
declare
that
system
to
be
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
money
makes
no
difference.
actually,
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
they
all
agreed
that
money
made
some
difference
and
money
made
the
difference.
now,
they
say
that
a
minimum
program
is
enough,
which
is
an
admission
that
money
must
make
a
difference,
that
there
must
be
a
maximum
program
but,
again,
i
want
to
go
into
the
fact
that
sweatt,
i
think,
did
away
with
minimums.
and,
i
want
to
point
the
court
to
mclaurin
because
this
is
what
the
state
did
and
it’s
not--
what
will
happen
is
a
result
that
counts
in
mclaurin.
the
state
of
oklahoma
said
this
child
shall
sit
in
the
back
of
the
room.
this
law
student
shall
sit
in
the
back
of
the
room,
and
they
wanted
to
justify
it
in
court
by
saying
“well,
nobody
else
would’ve
sat
with
him
anyway.
so,
the
statute
ought
to
be
upheld
because
it
wouldn’t
be
any
different
if
we
didn’t
have
it.”
and,
the
court
said
what
the
state
did
is
what
is
important.
i
want
to
say,
in
concluding,
that
the
san
antonio
independent
school
district,
the
central
city
school
district
was
the
named
defendant--
a
named
defendant
in
this
case
and
they
fought
as
hard
at
the
trial
level,
got
out
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
but,
on
appeal
of
this
case,
after
seeing
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
and
the
equity
involved
in
the
vast
discriminations,
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
the
decision
of
the
trial
court.
thank
you
very
much.
