each
district
would
have
the

row-a-hoe,
so
to
speak,
in
raising
that
additional
money
under
power
equalization
which
it
doesn’t
have
now.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
of
any
case
from
this
court
which
has
ever
held
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
state
simply
to
get
out
of
the
business
of
public
education
bag
and
baggage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
why
do
you
concede
that
a
minimum
education
may
be
a
constitutional
requirement
if
the
state
can
get
out
of
it
entirely?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn’t
hold
true
in
the
middle
unless
at
least
by
one
of
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
an
exhibit
in
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
student
in
mr.
justice
white’s
$500
district
is
going
to
be
worse
off
than
a
student
in
mr.
justice
white’s
$800
district
there
for
reasons
quite
beyond
his
control,
isn’t
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there’s
got
to
be
some
consistent
principle
that
governs
the
decision
rather
than
just
saying
that
this
is
really
bad
and
the
other
wouldn’t
be
quite
so
bad.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
dr.
berke
testify
or
did
he
submit
an
affidavit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wasn’t
a
question
of
being
present
in
court
and
testified.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
in
effect,
your
theory
makes
the
districts
equal
but
it
may
leave
the
students
utterly
unequal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don’t
contend,
do
you,
that
texas
setup
this
system
of
district
school
financing
with
the
purpose
of
discrimination
against
minorities,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn’t
that
a
great
deal
like
the
findings
we
had
in
jefferson
against
hackney
where
you
could
say,
statistically,
minorities
were
discriminated
against
but
there
was
no
finding
of
intent
to
discriminate
and,
as
to
welfare,
we
have
held
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn’t
welfare
fall
on
helpless
children
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
mr.
gochman
bound
by
that
comment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
i
had
a
case
here
from
texas
and
was
claiming
that
“texas
had
denied
me
equal
protection,”
i
think
i
would
feel
rather
strongly
that
whatever
the
figures
might
show
about
california
was
entitled
to
stand
on
the
record
made
in
the
texas
case.
