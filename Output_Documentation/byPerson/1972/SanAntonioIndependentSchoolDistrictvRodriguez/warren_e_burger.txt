arguments
next

san
antonio
school
district
against

mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief

e.

aren’t
there
several
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
the
past
two
or
three
years,
didn’t
justice
black
in
one
opinion,
whether
part
of
the
holding
or
not,
didn’t
he
say
pretty
flatly
the
state
could
close
all
its
schools
if
it
wanted
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
there
a
question,
however,
that
once
the
state
undertakes
to
furnish
education
then
it
must
furnish
a
certain
minimal
adequate
education
for
everybody?
once
they
start
to
go
down
that
road,
they
must
follow
through.

chief

warren
e.
burger
i
assume

rather,
sense

of
the
human
knowledge
on
this
sense.
chief

warren
e.
burger
very
well.

gochman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gochman--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
logic
of
it,
laying
aside
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
emphasis
on
“state,”
the
logic,
however,
would
apply
across
state
lines,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
logic
of
the
egalitarian
concept
that
you’re
arguing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why?
why
do
the
people
in
texas,
for

have
better
schools
than
the

rode
island?
if
they
are
better,
i
don’t
know
that
they
are
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’ve
said--
i
said,
laying
aside
that
limitation,
the
logic
of
your
argument
would
apply
with
equal
force.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
you
call
it
moral
grounds
or
an
egalitarian
philosophy
or
whatever.
may
i
ask
you
another
thing,
how
would
you
rate
such
items
as
the
need
for
police
protection,
fire
protection,
public
health
facilities,
where
would
you
grade
them
with
respect
to
public
education,
higher,
lower,
or
on
the
same
level,
as
the
functions
of
state
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
about
public
health
to

public
health
facilities?
