justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
hearing
here
as
to
the
question
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant
didn’t
testify
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
your
rule
if
it
were
clearly
shown
that
the
defendant
knew
what
his
rights
were,
even
though
he
weren't
informed?
even
though
someone
hadn’t
--
even
though
the
officer
hadn’t
given
him
some
warning?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
driver
say
he
didn’t
know
what
his
rights
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
did
testify,
didn’t
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
testimony
anywhere
at
the
hearing
that
the
defendant
put
on
any
testimony
for
the
defendant
that
the
fellow
who
gave
the
consent
did
not
know
what
his
rights
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
california
have
an
express
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
was
he
called
by
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
would
say,
then,
on
this
record,
then,
you
also
have
to
go
on
and
say
that
california
has
the
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that’s
constitutionally
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
the
constitution
would
not
permit
a
rule
of
california
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
must
first
put
on
some
testimony
that
alcala
didn’t
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
about
your
argument
that’s
in
the
context
of
the
state
court
having
already
approved
the
search
and
found
it
reasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what’s
the
deterrent
effect
of
a
later
federal
habeas
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
they
would
have
to
do
that,
but
i’m
talking
deterrents,
not
about
whether
it
would
help
the
defendant
have
his
conviction
set
aside.
of
course
it
would,
but
what
about
deterrents?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
really
isn’t
my
question.
let’s
assume
a
law
enforcement
officer,
who
is
--
just
like
these
law
enforcement
officers,
there’s
a
set
of
regulations
issued
that
says
you
need
only
to
be
worried
about
consent,
you
need
not
worry
about
waiver
standards
or
miranda
warnings
in
getting
consent
to
searches.
that’s
the
rule
and
the
state
court
approves
it,
now
you
think
that
adds
really
to
--
for
those
officers,
for
the
officers
involved
in
this
case,
it
would
be
much
of
a
deterrent,
if
later,
in
federal
habeas,
the
search
is
set
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you
for
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you’re
saying
that
on
the
evidence
in
this
record
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
for
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
california
rule
that
it
depends
on
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
long
as
the
officer
asks,
and
he
consents,
then
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
shifts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
obviously.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn’t
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
were.
so
you
would
say
that
if
alcala
had
been
called
to
the
stand
and
he
had
testified
he
did
not
know
that
he
could
have
refused,
or
he
testified
that
he
thought
he
had
to
consent,
this
might
be
a
different
case
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
hearing
here
as
to
the
question
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant
didn’t
testify
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
your
rule
if
it
were
clearly
shown
that
the
defendant
knew
what
his
rights
were,
even
though
he
weren't
informed?
even
though
someone
hadn’t
--
even
though
the
officer
hadn’t
given
him
some
warning?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
driver
say
he
didn’t
know
what
his
rights
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
did
testify,
didn’t
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
testimony
anywhere
at
the
hearing
that
the
defendant
put
on
any
testimony
for
the
defendant
that
the
fellow
who
gave
the
consent
did
not
know
what
his

were?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
california
have
an
express
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
was
he
called
by
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
would
say,
then,
on
this
record,
then,
you
also
have
to
go
on
and
say
that
california
has
the
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that’s
constitutionally
required?
justice

you

that
the

the

that

justice

well,
what

you

about
your

that’s
in
the
context
of
the
state
court
having
already

the

of

it

what
about

that

my

justice

alright.
justice

so
you’re
