we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-732,
schneckloth
against
bustamonte.
mr.
granucci,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
connect
the
picking
up
of
the
three
men
with
the
efforts
to
cash
the
checks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
was
the
purpose
of
their
association
for
that
moment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
have
understood
your
brief,
your
argument
in
part
was
that
the
very
fact
of
a
request
by
the
officer
gave
--
amounted
to
an
inference,
an
indication
that
the
request
could
be
denied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
ninth
circuit
comment
on
the
fact
the
bustamonte
helped
with
the
search,
assisted
the
officers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
you
recall
from
the
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alcala
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
he
was
the
one
that
had
a
driver’s
license,
was
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think,
i
got
those
two
parties
confused,
because
i
recall
you
have
an
argument
that
the
conduct
that
followed
the
request
for
consent
and
giving
of
consent
verbally
demonstrated
a
consensual
situation
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
in
what
words
or
in
what
form
the
request
to
exhibit
the
driver’s
license
was
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
will
find
it,
you
won’t
have
to
stop
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me.
before
you
go
on
with
that,
am
i
correct
that,
at
page
30,
the
question
is
“did
you
ask
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
for
a
license?
“yes,
i
did,”
“and
was
he
able
to
produce
the
license,”
“no.”
it
doesn’t
show
the
precise
words
used,
as
it
does
with
respect
to
the
searching
of
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
expecting
to
see
whether
the
two
situations
were
comparable,
but
apparently,
on
this
record,
they’re
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
granucci.
mr.
tobisman
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn’t
that
suggest
a
totality
of
circumstances
concept?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
satisfy
your
standard,
counsel,
if
the
policeman
had
said,
in
addition
to
what
he
did
say,
“you
are
not
required
by
law
to
consent,
you
may
refuse
your
consent
if
you
wish;
but
if
you
refuse,
we
will
be
obliged
to
detain
you
here
until
we
can
get
a
search
warrant?”
would
that
satisfy
your
standard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i’m
not
going
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
—
an
appraisal
of
that
question,
counsel.
i’m
just
suggesting
if
the
policeman
had
made
that
statement,
in
those
words,
and
then
sometime
later,
someone
would
have
to
decide
whether
he
lawfully
could
have
given
the
implication
of
the
threat
to
hold
him
until
he
got
the
search
warrant.
but
if
he
gave
that
warning,
would
that
be
adequate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
that’s
a
coercion
at
that
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
placed
the
man
under
arrest,
could
he
search
the
entire
car
then
and
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
he
have
been
arrested
for
operating
the
motor
vehicle
without
a
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
think
california
makes
a
prima
facie
case
of
consent
by
showing
that
he
said,
as
he
did
here,
“go
right
ahead;
just
go
right
ahead”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
think
that’s
reinforced
any
by
the
fact
that
the
speaker
who
said
these
words
then
proceeded
to
help
the
officer
with
the
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
essence
of
your
case
is
that
the
california
test
is
not
a
fair
test
of
reasonableness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
whole
position
assumes,
as
a
practical
matter
and
i’m
not
suggesting
it
isn’t
correct,
but
i
suggest
your
whole
position
assumes
that
if
the
police
officer
had
pursued
the
proposition
after
he
said,
“yes,
go
ahead,
and
help
yourself,”
and
then
the
police
officer
said,
“it’s
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
you
don’t
have
to
consent.
now,
do
you
still
consent?”
as
a
practical
matter,
do
you
think
the
man
is
going
to
withdraw
his
consent
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
without
drawing
great
suspicion
on
himself
that
would
lead
to
further
detention?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
any
more
voluntary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
tobisman,
your
time
is
up.
mr.
granucci,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tobisman,
you
served
at
the
court’s
request

by
the
court’s
appointment.

your
client,
