justice
thurgood
marshall
the
thing
that
worries
me
is
the
officer
comes
up
and
says,
“would
you
let
me
see
your
driver’s
license?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
if
he
says,
“would
you
mind,”
don’t
you
usually
understand
that
he
means
“you
either
show
it
to
me
or
else”?
isn’t
that
what
you
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
not
my
question.
but
the
nice
polite
police
officer
says,
“would
you
mind
doing
it?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
means
“give
it
to
me.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
that
instant;
that
means
“give
it
to
me.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
then
he
says,
“would
you
mind
letting
me
see
your
registration?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
he
says,
“may
i
search
your
car?”
then.
now,
what’s
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what’s
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mostly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
difference
you
can
give
for
those
three
questions,
other
that
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
stop
a
car
and
say,
“what
have
you
got
in
there?
have
you
got
any
contraband
in
your
car?”
and
the
owner
of
the
cars
says,
“go
ahead
and
look,”
how
about
that
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
not
what
i
said.
my
question
was,
“what
have
you
got
in
your
car?
do
you
have
any
contraband
in
it?”
it’s
a
question
and
the
guy
says,
“well,
be
my
guest;
look.
let
me
open
up
the
trunk.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you’d
be
in
trouble,
won't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
that’s
not
a
question
of
consent.
that’s
a
question
of
an
invitation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
it
gets
to
that
point,
the
police
officer
can
say,
“you
don’t
have
to
let
me
look.”
at
that
stage,
that’s
what
you’d
require?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
the
burden
on
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
again,
would
you
tell
me
why
they
asked
to
search
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
