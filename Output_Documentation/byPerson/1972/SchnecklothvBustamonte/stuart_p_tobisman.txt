mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
issues
presented
in
this
case
are,
first,
can
a
consent
search
be
valid
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
any
knowledge
of
the
fourth
amendment
right
being
relinquished.
the
second
issue
is,
can
state
prisoners
continue
to
use
federal
habeas
corpus
to
raise
their
fourth
amendment
claims.
with
respect
to
the
consent
search
issue,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
questions
to
be
answered.
the
first
question
is,
what
are
the
elements
of
a
waiver
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights?
as
recently
as
last
june,
in
baker
versus
wingo,
this
court
defined
a
waiver
of
constitutional
rights
as
an
intentional
relinquishment
or
abandonment
of
a
known
right
or
privilege
and
courts
are
to
indulge
every
reasonable
presumption
against
the
existence
of
such
a
surrender.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
think
that
the
essential
elements
are,
first,
the
voluntariness,
the
fact
that
it
is
in
fact
an
intentional
act
and
second,
that
the
right
be
known.
i
would
submit
that
i
don’t
frankly
understand
how
a
man
can
be
deemed
to
have
surrendered
a
right
unless
he
knows
it
exists.
i
mean,
what
has
he
done?
it
seems
to
me
that
to
surrender
the
right
means
that
he
was
aware
of
its
existence,
and
decided,
for
any
of
a
number
of
reasons,
to
give
it
up.
i
believe
that
the
central
question
is
really
one
that
you
have
alluded
to,
sir,
namely,
should
a
consent
search
be
deemed
the
equivalent
of
a
waiver
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
so
that
all
waiver
elements,
including
knowledge,
must
be
demonstrated
to
validate
the
search.
contrary
to
the
state’s
position,
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
police
is
not
an
acceptable
criteria
for
determining
whether
a
search
is
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment.
rather,
the
criteria
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
one
of
reasonableness,
and
this
concept
of
reasonableness
is
embedded
in
history
and
context
of
the
evils
the
fourth
amendment
was
intended
to
prevent.
the
primary
aim
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
protect
each
individual’s
privacy
from
arbitrary
governmental
intrusion.
it
is
a
focus
on
the
right
of
the
victim,
not
on
the
good
faith,
subjective
state
of
mind,
if
i
may
say,
of
the
police
officer
conducting
the
search.
this
court
has
repeatedly
reiterated
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
among
the
most
fundamental
of
our
constitutional
safeguards,
and,
over
the
years,
many
cases
have
come
before
this
court,
which
have
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
safeguards
and
very,
very
elaborate
procedures
to
validate
a
search.
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
its
recent
statement
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
that
warrantless
searches
are
deemed
per
se
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
subject
to
a
few
very
limited,
well
defined
exceptions.
i
would
further
submit
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
perfectly
agree
that
consent
searches
are
permissible
under
the
constitution.
my
point
would
be
that
consent
searches
purport
to
make
all
of
these
other
safeguards
irrelevant.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
let’s
look
at
this
case.
if
the
search
is
valid
in
this
particular
case,
that
means
that
the
search
is
constitutionally
permissible,
even
though
there
is
no
warrant,
no
probable
cause,
no
one
has
been
questioned
about
any
specific
crime,
no
one
is
under
arrest.
there
is
no
threat
or
danger
to
the
police
from
the
search
premises.
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
from
mr.
alcala,
the
individual
who
allegedly
consented
to
this
search.
and,
last,
there
is
not
even
the
remotest
effort
made
to
determine
if
he
had
any
notion
at
all
of
his
right
to
resist
the
search.
this
record
discloses
one
fact
about
mr.
alcala.
he
was
approximately
twenty
years
old,
that’s
all.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
would
say
that
i
would
require
that
there
be
a
showing
that
he
did
in
fact
understand
his
right
to
request
that
the
police
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
not
at
all,
sir.
i
concede
that
he
could
in
fact
waive
his
right
to
the
production
of
a
warrant.
my
point
is,
in
this
particular
case,
if
this
search
is
constitutionally
permissible,
it’s
permissible
without
regard
to
any
of
the
traditional
safeguards
that
this
court
has
developed.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
one
question
underlying
that
is
whether,
in
fact,
the
police
could
detain
him
under
those
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
were
sufficient
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
believe
that
such
a
warning
would
be
adequate,
but
i
would
premise
that,
if
i
may,
by
saying
that
in
my
mind,
that
appears
to
me
to
constitute
possibly
an
arrest.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
that
it
is,
and
i
think
that,
on
that
basis,
a
search
could
be
approved,
so
long
as
the
justification
for
the
detention
is
appropriate
at
that
time.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
believe
that
under
the
court’s
recent
decisions
dealing
with
searches
incident
to
arrest,
a
search
of
the
entire
automobile
at
that
time
might
not
be
constitutionally
justified.
my
point
here
is
that
no
one
was
under
arrest.
the
appendix
clearly
states,
at
page
40,
when
the
officer
was
asked,
no
one
was
under
arrest,
he
had
not
asked
any
questions
at
all
about
a
specific
crime.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it’s
doubtful
that
he
was
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
particular
crime
at
the
time
the
search
was
undertaken.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
under
california
law,
i
frankly
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
assuming
he
could,
i
think
that
there
would
be
--
i
would
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
sufficient
basis,
as
a
result
of
that
particular
arrest,
to
search
the
entire
automobile.
i’d
like
to
point
out,
if
i
may,
sir,
that
at
that
time
all
of
the
individuals
were
out
of
the
car,
there
was
no
one
in
the
car,
there
was
no
threat
or
danger
to
the
policeman
at
that
moment.
the
sole
justification
was
mr.
alcala’s
alleged
invitation
to
the
police,
come
in,
search
my
car.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
would
say
that
the
decision
affirming
the
ninth
circuit’s
disposition
in
this
case
would
not
necessarily
require
that
affirmative
admonitions
be
given
in
all
fourth
amendment
cases.
it’s
true
that
such
admonitions
are
required
in
the
context
of
fifth
and
sixth
amendments,
but
i
would
respectfully
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
lower
court
decision
cited
in
my
brief,
which
give
examples
of
courts
considering
this
particular
question
without
regard
to
--
in
instances
where
there
were
not
affirmative
warnings
given.
i’d
like
to
go
on,
if
i
may,
because
i
think,
in
all
candor,
that
i
should
admit
that
were
i,
a
police
administrator,
under
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
i
would
instruct
my
officers
to
make
it
clear
to
the
individual
that
the
sole
justification
for
a
search
of
the
house
or
automobile,
as
it
may
be,
is
their
consent
and
i
would
not
want
to
lose
convictions
because
my
officers
failed
to
apprise
the
individual
of
his
rights,
and
put
me
to
obtaining
a
search
warrant.
however,
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
is
that
there
are
many
cases
that
appear
to
turn
on
minor
technicalities.
people,
i
notice
a
lot
of
hostility
to
cases
dealing
possibly
with
some
of
the
elements
of
search
warrants
and
things
of
that
sort,
or
hostility
in
terms
that
are
--
pardon
me,
hostile
reactions
in
terms
of
decisions
dealing
with
the
content
of
a
warrant.
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
a
case
that
deals
only
with
the
minor
technicality.
this
case,
i
really
believe,
goes
to
the
fundamental
question
of,
who
is
entitled
to
fourth
amendment
protections?
is
it
only
the
man
who
is
sophisticated
and
educated
and
knows
of
his
rights,
and
who
will
not
consent;
or
is
it
all
of
the
citizens,
including
the
poor
person,
the
uneducated
person,
the
person
who
fears
the
police?
if
they
are
all
to
be
entitled
to
the
fourth
amendment’s
protections,
i
don’t
see
how
they
can
be
deemed
to
have
given
up
that
right,
unless
there
is
some
showing
in
the
record
that
they
were
aware
of
it
at
the
time
they
allegedly
surrendered
it.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
my
understanding
is
that
the
question
was
raised
at
the
trial,
and
that
testimony
was
taken
in
chambers.
the
officer
involved
gave
his
testimony,
and
i
believe,
that
there
was
other
testimony
given
by
joe
gonzales,
the
man
who
was
driving
the
automobile.
and
they
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
the
defendant
did
not
testify
and
mr.
--
as
i
mentioned
before,
mr.
alcala
did
not
testify.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
if
i
may
backtrack
a
little
bit.
the
actual
consent
was
given
by
mr.
alcala.
i
would
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
result
if
there
were
a
showing
that
he
was
aware
of
his
right
at
the
time
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
the
actual
--
the
man
that
gave
the
consent
was
joe
alcala.
he
had
apparently
borrowed
the
car
from
his
brother.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
he
did
not
testify.
but
he
was
the
man
who
did
give
the
consent.
all
of
the
evidence
involved
with
the
actual
conversation
is
based
upon
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
testimony
of
joe
gonzales
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
there
was
--
at
the
time
the
motion
was
made,
there
was
some
suggestion
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
that
the
search
was
not
properly
authorized,
that
mr.
alcala
was
not
aware
of
his
rights,
and
that
it
was
conducted
in
a
--
the
search
was
conducted
in
a
coercive
atmosphere.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i’m
afraid
i
can’t
answer
that,
sir.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
alcala
never
testified
at
all.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
he
was
not
called
by
the
defendant.
my
understanding,
and
i’ve
tried
to
communicate
with
the
attorney
who
handled
the
case
at
trial,
is
that
he
could
not
be
located.
they
made
an
effort,
but
could
not
locate
him
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
oh!
yes.
oh,
clearly.
clearly.
i
think
that
the
elements
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
i
do.
i
believe
that
in
order
to
make
any
of
the
other
safeguards
meaningful
and
worthwhile,
a
right
should
not
be
surrendered
unless
there’s
some
showing
that
the
individual
knew
it
existed.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
only
--
there
were
citations
issued,
traffic
citations
issued
to
the
driver.
so
far
as
i
know,
mr.
alcala
was
never
convicted
of
anything.
mr.
gonzales,
who
provided
the
main
testimony
in
connection
with
the
search,
other
than
that
provided
by
the
officer,
was
never
convicted.
i
believe
that,
as
i
mentioned,
that
the
effective
consent
is
to
make
all
of
the
traditional
fourth
amendment
safeguards,
including
the
emphasis
on
search
warrants
irrelevant.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
that’s
my
position.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that
question,
i
think,
is
obviously
a
difficult
one.
i
would
say
that
mr.
bustamonte
was
riding
in
the
car,
presumably
as
the
guest
of
--
pardon
me,
mr.
bustamonte
was
the
guest
of
mr.
alcala.
i
think
that
mr.
alcala’s
control
over
the
premises
could
be
deemed
satisfactory
so
that
if
he
consented
to
the
search,
the
search
would
be
valid.
i
would
quote
--
one
thing
i
would
—
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
yes.
in
my
case
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
right.
i
believe
that
otherwise
it
would
require
that
all
six
people
be
questioned,
and
i
think
again,
viewing
this
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no.
i
believe
that
the
authorization
from
this
search
resulted
from
mr.
alcala’s
alleged
consent.
that
was
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no.
i
believe
that
the
justification
for
the
search,
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
search
must
be
presented
by
the
state.
the
state
is
required
to
establish
the
basis
for
the
search,
and
i
think
that
what
it
must
do
is
demonstrate
the
elements
of
a
waiver
of
the
fourth
amendment
right.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
i
don’t.
i
think
that
the
same
question
could
be
asked
in
a
case
where,
for
example,
the
police
officer
says,
“can
i
see
your
driver’s
license?”
and
you
answer
“sure.”
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
you
say
“sure”
in
any
way
indicates
whether
you’ve
made
a
judgment
based
on
your
knowledge
of
the
alternatives
available
to
you
at
that
time.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
believe
that
the
assistance
rendered
by
mr.
alcala
is
partially
overstated.
after
all,
the
police
officer
asked,
according
to
mr.
gonzales,
i
believe
it’s
around
page
52,
he
asked,
“does
the
trunk
open?”
and
mr.
gonzales
said
that
mr.
alcala
said,
“yes,
it
does,”
and
walked
over
and
opened
it.
there’s
another
statement
where
he
says,
“how
about
opening
the
trunk?”
i
mean
these
are
the
statements
of
gonzales,
not
the
man
who
opened
the
trunk,
not
the
man
who
consented
to
the
search.
the
statement
of
gonzales,
the
man
who
was
driving
the
car.
the
man,
at
that
point,
was
17
or
18
years
old,
and
is
talking
about
a
conversation
that
he
overheard.
i
don’t
think
that
that
in
any
way
indicates
alcala’s
state
of
mind
at
that
particular
point.
i’d
also
like
to
mention
that
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
alcala
was
well
aware
that
the
checks
were
in
the
car,
either
on
the
possession
of
someone
in
the
car
or
in
the
car;
and
it
just
seems
to
me,
if
he
was
aware
of
his
rights,
it’s
curious
that
he
would
so
readily
authorize
the
police
to
search
that
car,
when
they
would
not
have
any
other
basis
to
do
so.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
not
that
i’m
aware
of.
what
happened
is
mr.
bustamonte,
on
his
own,
after
the
california
supreme
court
denied
the
petition
for
hearing,
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court.
he
did
this
without
the
assistance
of
counsel,
and
i
was
not
called
upon
to
assist
him
until
after
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
in
this
matter.
again
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
i
don’t,
sir.
i
think
that
--
although
i’d
like
to
reserve
some
discussion
at
that
point
on
the
second
part
of
the
argument,
i
think
that
this
court
in
fay
versus
noia
held
that
certiorari
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
normal
appellate
channel,
and
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
be
filed
as
a
precondition
to
seeking
federal
habeas
corpus.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
right,
overruled
dar
versus
burford,
which
had,
as
i
understand
it
required
that
such
a
petition
be
filed
prior
to
seeking
habeas
corpus.
again,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
has
a
real
direct
bearing
on
this
particular
case.
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
once
again,
what
i
think
to
be
the
most
important
aspect
to
this
case.
that
is
that
i’m
not
seeking
to
impose
what
i
feel
to
be
an
undue
burden
on
law
enforcement
officers.
after
all,
consent
searches
do
not
involve
probable
cause,
they
do
not
involve
emergencies,
they
do
not
involve
dangers
to
the
police.
the
sole
justification
for
the
search
is
the
suspect’s
invitation.
therefore,
i
submit
that
the
court
should
make
the
effort
to
determine
whether
a
knowledgeable
surrender
of
constitutional
rights
was
present
at
the
time
such
consent
is
given.
furthermore,
it
is
my
understanding
that
federal
agencies,
such
as
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs,
and
the
f.b.i.,
do
obtain
written
consents
before
conducting
a
search,
and
i
have
seen
one
of
the
forms
that
is
used
by
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs,
and
it
does
contain
a
statement
to
apprise
the
suspect
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
again,
i
don’t
believe
that
this
is
an
undue
burden
on
the
one
hand
for
the
police;
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
to
reject
the
waiver
test
would
be
to,
in
effect,
substantially
dilute
the
effectiveness
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
actually
remove
it,
actually
from
the
protections
of
many
citizens
of
this
country,
who
simply
are
not
aware
of
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
this
in
terms
of
what
are
the
police
most
likely
to
do.
if
the
police
have
a
probable
cause
to
seek
a
warrant,
i
think
that
this
court’s
decisions
indicate
that
they
should
take
that
tack.
that’s
the
preferred
way
to
do
it.
at
a
time
when
they’re
seeking
consent,
if
it
is,
in
fact,
a
search
that
can
only
be
justified
by
consent,
there
is
no
other
basis.
there
is
no
other
basis
for
the
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
don’t
believe
that
it
creates
a
difficulty
for
them
if
they
are
seeking
consent,
because
they
have
no
other
basis
for
the
search
to
make
it,
to
find
out
for
themselves
or
to
somehow
be
able
to
demonstrate
the
individual’s
awareness
of
his
rights
at
the
time
they
conduct
the
search.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
he
may
in
fact
do
that
on
many
occasions.
and
frankly
that
concerns
me,
because
that
means
that
whereas
the
police
officer
could
not
conduct
that
search
against
me,
for
example,
or
maybe
against
other
people
who
are
aware
of
their
rights,
he
would
be
able,
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
conduct
that
search
against
many
citizens
in
this
country
who
are
not
aware
of
their
rights.
i
do
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
ambiguities
and
difficulties
that
the
police
officer
must
face
up
to,
but
i
believe
that
unless
the
waiver
test
is
applied
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment,
the
result
would
be
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
police
can
conduct
searches
against
vast
segments
of
the
society
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
cannot
otherwise
conduct
and
that
they
could
not
conduct,
for
example,
against
people
who
are
aware
of
their
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
correct.
my
position
is
that
ker
versus
california,
although
it
did
not
establish
supervisory
authority
over
the
state
courts,
u.s.
supreme
court
supervisory
authority
over
the
state
courts,
it
did
clearly
indicate
that
certain
basic,
fundamental
criteria
must
be
met
in
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
basic
elements
--
one
of
the
most
basic
aspects
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
i
could
possibly
conceive
of.
is
the
right
to
be
available
to
all
citizens,
no
matter
if
they’re
uneducated,
educated,
sophisticated
or
unsophisticated,
or
is
it
not?
i
think
that
that’s
the
essential
question
and
is
fundamental
--
it
reaches
the
level
of
a
ker
versus
california
fundamental
criteria
in
my
opinion.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
that
--
i
can’t
conceive,
in
my
own
mind,
how
you
can
have
consent
to
something
unless
you
know
it
exists.
i
don’t
understand
how
you
can
surrender
something
unless
you
know
it
exists.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
right.
pardon
me,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
pardon
me,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
that’s
right.
my
argument
is
that
with
respect
to
their
interpretation
of
what
is
consent,
they
do
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
ker
versus
california.
in
truth,
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
believe
that
ker
versus
california
would
be
in
my
favor,
if
only
because
it
requires
that
certain
fundamental
safeguards
are
--
certain
fundamental
criteria
are
met
in
viewing
the
elements
of
a
constitutional
right.
the
state
has
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
offhand,
i
can’t
remember
the
passage
that
you’re
referring
to.
but,
again,
i
cite
ker
for
the
proposition
that
certain
minimal
criteria
must
be
met
by
the
state.
they
can
go
beyond
it,
but
they
can’t
fall
below
it.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
would
be
afraid
that
that
represents
some
sort
of
coercion,
just
a
suggestion
to
the
individual
that
“we
know
you’ve
got
it”
or
“do
you
have
it”;
that
would
concern
me.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
would
say
that
at
the
time
the
evidence,
if
in
fact
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
that
if
i’m
inviting,
if
i’m
inviting
an
officer,
for
example,
to
search
my
car,
if
it’s
a
true
invitation,
it
can
only
be
based
on
my
understanding
of
my
right
to
say
“it’s
none
of
your
business.”
“if
you’ve
got
a
basis
to
search
my
car,
go
ahead.”
but
i
don’t
have
to
let
you.
i
think
that
that’s
really
the
underlying
question
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
to
really
be
an
invitation,
means
that
i
know
i
can
say
no.
if
i
don’t
know
i
can
say
no,
i’m
being
forced
to
do
it.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i’m
saying
that
either
at
that
stage
or
at
trial,
some
evidence
would
have
to
be
adduced
to
demonstrate
that
the
individual
knew
he
could
say
no.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
turn
to
the
second
issue,
which
is,
should
state
prisoners
continue
to
have
access
to
federal
habeas
corpus
to
raise
fourth
amendment
claims.
the
state
requests
the
court
to
turn
its
back
on
the
extensive,
historical
development
of
habeas
corpus
as
a
remedy
to
vindicate
fundamental
constitutional
protection.
in
1969,
in
kaufman
versus
united
states,
this
court
held
that
federal
prisoners
can
use
federal
habeas
corpus
to
raise
fourth
amendment
claims,
even
though
such
claims
have
been
previously
considered
in
a
federal
court.
state
prisoners
have
an
even
greater
need
for
federal
habeas
corpus,
since
it
will
probably
be
their
first
opportunity
to
raise
their
federal
constitutional
claim
in
a
federal
court.
since
1916,
certiorari
has
been
the
only
direct
appellate
access
into
federal
courts
which
is
available
to
state
prisoners
under
normal
--
under
most
criminal
convictions.
again,
in
1963,
in
fay
versus
noia,
this
court
indicated
that
since
certiorari
is
by
no
means
the
equivalent
of
a
normal,
direct
appellate
channel,
there
is
no
need
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
as
a
precondition
to
seeking
federal
habeas
corpus.
today,
with
the
increased
workload
of
this
court,
certiorari
is
even
less
of
an
effective
direct
appellate
channel
than
it
was
when
fay
versus
noia
was
decided
back
in
1963.
thus
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
clear
that
the
state’s
real
goal
is
to
deprive
state
prisoners
of
any
meaningful
access
to
federal
courts
in
connection
with
their
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
court
indicated
its
firm
refusal
to
do
this
in
kaufman,
and
i
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
continue
to
reject
the
state’s
position
in
this
case.
federal
habeas
corpus
is
the
main
opportunity
for
careful,
consistent
federal
court
review
of
state
court
decisions
regarding
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fifty
state
supreme
courts
can
develop,
and
have
developed
in
the
past,
inconsistent
or
erroneous
rules
regarding
fundamental
constitutional
protections.
federal
habeas
corpus
provides
an
efficient,
effective
remedy
to
correct
those
errors.
it
guarantees
the
fair
and
equal
treatment
for
all
citizens,
wherever
tried,
with
respect
to
their
fundamental
constitutional
protections,
including
those
of
the
fourth
amendment.
clearly,
then,
federal
habeas
corpus
is
the
principle
remedy
available
to
implement
the
rule
of
ker
versus
california,
as
i
previously
stated
my
understanding
of
that
rule.
moreover,
and
although
i
will
admit
that
this
possibly
goes
beyond
the
narrow
scope
of
this
issue,
i
believe
that
federal
habeas
corpus
decisions
have
the
same
general
deterrent
effect
on
progressive
law
enforcement
departments
as
decisions
at
pretrial,
at
trial,
or
on
direct
appeal.
it
seems
to
me
it’s
one
thing
for
a
police
officer
who
conducted
a
particular
search,
or
the
particular
seizure,
to
see
that
he
lost
the
case
as
a
result
of
his
conduct;
possibly
that
will
affect
his
conduct,
possibly
it
will
not.
i
think
the
more
important
aspect
of
this
is
the
general
deterrent
value
of
all
court
decisions
dealing
with
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
that,
in
effect,
the
court
is
saying
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness,
a
standard
based
on
vindicating
the
individual’s
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
governmental
intrusions,
that
standard
of
reasonableness
prescribes
certain
rules,
certain
conduct
that
the
police
must
comply
with.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
with
respect
to
deterrents,
if
this
court,
in
this
case,
affirms
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
i
am
confident
that
all
around
the
country,
police
officers
will
recognize
that
in
order
to
sustain
a
conviction,
it
is
going
to
be
necessary
to
demonstrate
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
individual
who
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
absolutely.
i
think
that
the
fact
is
that
--
what
we’re
really
talking
about
is
conforming
conduct
to
a
set
of
criteria,
to
a
set
of
standards.
if
this
court
holds
that
a
conviction
cannot
be
sustained
on
the
basis
of
—
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
oh,
oh,
i’m
sorry.
my
statement
is
intended
as
a
statement
of
deterring
the
improper
conduct
in
the
future.
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
that’s
the
essential
element
of
this
case.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
pardon
me,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
the
ultimate
result
in
that
context
would
be
that
the
conviction
would
be
overturned,
presumably,
if
in
fact
we
had
all
of
the
other
elements.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
no,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
believe
that
the
police
officer
would
ultimately
look
to
guidance
to
the
court
that
is
at
the
end
of
the
line,
that’s
going
to,
in
effect,
say
whether
this
conviction
can
stand
or
not.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
right.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
it
may
draw
a
great
suspicion
on
him
to
do
that,
but
i
frankly
would
be
satisfied,
assuming
there
is
a
showing
that
it
was
in
fact
a
voluntary
act,
and
freely
he
decided
to
say,
“no,
you
can’t
search
the
car.”
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
that
we’re
talking
again
about
the
other
side
of
the
issue,
which
is;
can
you
voluntarily
give
up
something
you
don’t
know
about,
that’s
one
side.
the
other
side
is;
are
you
really
voluntarily
saying
yes,
when
the
policeman
says,
“i
want
to
search
your
car.”
i
assume
that
you
can,
in
fact,
make
a
voluntary
decision
to
let
the
police
search
your
home,
let
the
police
search
your
car.
i
assume
that
that
can,
in
fact,
be
done.
but
my
position
is
that
it
can
be
only
done
if
you
are
aware
of
your
right
to
say
no.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
issues
presented
in
this
case
are,
first,
can
a
consent
search
be
valid
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
any
knowledge
of
the
fourth
amendment
right
being
relinquished.
the
second
issue
is,
can
state
prisoners
continue
to
use
federal
habeas
corpus
to
raise
their
fourth
amendment
claims.
with
respect
to
the
consent
search
issue,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
questions
to
be
answered.
the
first
question
is,
what
are
the
elements
of
a
waiver
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights?
as
recently
as
last
june,
in
baker
versus
wingo,
this
court
defined
a
waiver
of
constitutional
rights
as
an
intentional
relinquishment
or
abandonment
of
a
known
right
or
privilege
and
courts
are
to
indulge
every
reasonable
presumption
against
the
existence
of
such
a
surrender.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
think
that
the
essential
elements
are,
first,
the
voluntariness,
the
fact
that
it
is
in
fact
an
intentional
act
and
second,
that
the
right
be
known.
i
would
submit
that
i
don’t
frankly
understand
how
a
man
can
be
deemed
to
have
surrendered
a
right
unless
he
knows
it
exists.
i
mean,
what
has
he
done?
it
seems
to
me
that
to
surrender
the
right
means
that
he
was
aware
of
its
existence,
and
decided,
for
any
of
a
number
of
reasons,
to
give
it
up.
i
believe
that
the
central
question
is
really
one
that
you
have
alluded
to,
sir,
namely,
should
a
consent
search
be
deemed
the
equivalent
of
a
waiver
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
so
that
all
waiver
elements,
including
knowledge,
must
be
demonstrated
to
validate
the
search.
contrary
to
the
state’s
position,
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
police
is
not
an
acceptable
criteria
for
determining
whether
a
search
is
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment.
rather,
the
criteria
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
one
of
reasonableness,
and
this
concept
of
reasonableness
is
embedded
in
history
and
context
of
the
evils
the
fourth
amendment
was
intended
to
prevent.
the
primary
aim
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
protect
each
individual’s
privacy
from
arbitrary
governmental
intrusion.
it
is
a
focus
on
the
right
of
the
victim,
not
on
the
good
faith,
subjective
state
of
mind,
if
i
may
say,
of
the
police
officer
conducting
the
search.
this
court
has
repeatedly
reiterated
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
among
the
most
fundamental
of
our
constitutional
safeguards,
and,
over
the
years,
many
cases
have
come
before
this
court,
which
have
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
safeguards
and
very,
very
elaborate
procedures
to
validate
a
search.
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
its
recent
statement
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
that
warrantless
searches
are
deemed
per
se
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
subject
to
a
few
very
limited,
well
defined
exceptions.
i
would
further
submit
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
perfectly
agree
that
consent
searches
are
permissible
under
the
constitution.
my
point
would
be
that
consent
searches
purport
to
make
all
of
these
other
safeguards
irrelevant.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
let’s
look
at
this
case.
if
the
search
is
valid
in
this
particular
case,
that
means
that
the
search
is
constitutionally
permissible,
even
though
there
is
no
warrant,
no
probable
cause,
no
one
has
been
questioned
about
any
specific
crime,
no
one
is
under
arrest.
there
is
no
threat
or
danger
to
the
police
from
the
search
premises.
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
from
mr.
alcala,
the
individual
who
allegedly
consented
to
this
search.
and,
last,
there
is
not
even
the
remotest
effort
made
to
determine
if
he
had
any
notion
at
all
of
his
right
to
resist
the
search.
this
record
discloses
one
fact
about
mr.
alcala.
he
was
approximately
twenty
years
old,
that’s
all.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
would
say
that
i
would
require
that
there
be
a
showing
that
he
did
in
fact
understand
his
right
to
request
that
the
police
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
not
at
all,
sir.
i
concede
that
he
could
in
fact
waive
his
right
to
the
production
of
a
warrant.
my
point
is,
in
this
particular
case,
if
this
search
is
constitutionally
permissible,
it’s
permissible
without
regard
to
any
of
the
traditional
safeguards
that
this
court
has
developed.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
one
question
underlying
that
is
whether,
in
fact,
the
police
could
detain
him
under
those
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
were
sufficient
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
believe
that
such
a
warning
would
be
adequate,
but
i
would
premise
that,
if
i
may,
by
saying
that
in
my
mind,
that
appears
to
me
to
constitute
possibly
an
arrest.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
that
it
is,
and
i
think
that,
on
that
basis,
a
search
could
be
approved,
so
long
as
the
justification
for
the
detention
is
appropriate
at
that
time.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
believe
that
under
the
court’s
recent
decisions
dealing
with
searches
incident
to
arrest,
a
search
of
the
entire
automobile
at
that
time
might
not
be
constitutionally
justified.
my
point
here
is
that
no
one
was
under
arrest.
the
appendix
clearly
states,
at
page
40,
when
the
officer
was
asked,
no
one
was
under
arrest,
he
had
not
asked
any
questions
at
all
about
a
specific
crime.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it’s
doubtful
that
he
was
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
particular
crime
at
the
time
the
search
was
undertaken.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
under
california
law,
i
frankly
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
assuming
he
could,
i
think
that
there
would
be
--
i
would
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
sufficient
basis,
as
a
result
of
that
particular
arrest,
to
search
the
entire
automobile.
i’d
like
to
point
out,
if
i
may,
sir,
that
at
that
time
all
of
the
individuals
were
out
of
the
car,
there
was
no
one
in
the
car,
there
was
no
threat
or
danger
to
the
policeman
at
that
moment.
the
sole
justification
was
mr.
alcala’s
alleged
invitation
to
the
police,
come
in,
search
my
car.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
would
say
that
the
decision
affirming
the
ninth
circuit’s
disposition
in
this
case
would
not
necessarily
require
that
affirmative
admonitions
be
given
in
all
fourth
amendment
cases.
it’s
true
that
such
admonitions
are
required
in
the
context
of
fifth
and
sixth
amendments,
but
i
would
respectfully
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
lower
court
decision
cited
in
my
brief,
which
give
examples
of
courts
considering
this
particular
question
without
regard
to
--
in
instances
where
there
were
not
affirmative
warnings
given.
i’d
like
to
go
on,
if
i
may,
because
i
think,
in
all
candor,
that
i
should
admit
that
were
i,
a
police
administrator,
under
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
i
would
instruct
my
officers
to
make
it
clear
to
the
individual
that
the
sole
justification
for
a
search
of
the
house
or
automobile,
as
it
may
be,
is
their
consent
and
i
would
not
want
to
lose
convictions
because
my
officers
failed
to
apprise
the
individual
of
his
rights,
and
put
me
to
obtaining
a
search
warrant.
however,
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
is
that
there
are
many
cases
that
appear
to
turn
on
minor
technicalities.
people,
i
notice
a
lot
of
hostility
to
cases
dealing
possibly
with
some
of
the
elements
of
search
warrants
and
things
of
that
sort,
or
hostility
in
terms
that
are
--
pardon
me,
hostile
reactions
in
terms
of
decisions
dealing
with
the
content
of
a
warrant.
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
a
case
that
deals
only
with
the
minor
technicality.
this
case,
i
really
believe,
goes
to
the
fundamental
question
of,
who
is
entitled
to
fourth
amendment
protections?
is
it
only
the
man
who
is
sophisticated
and
educated
and
knows
of
his
rights,
and
who
will
not
consent;
or
is
it
all
of
the
citizens,
including
the
poor
person,
the
uneducated
person,
the
person
who
fears
the
police?
if
they
are
all
to
be
entitled
to
the
fourth
amendment’s
protections,
i
don’t
see
how
they
can
be
deemed
to
have
given
up
that
right,
unless
there
is
some
showing
in
the
record
that
they
were
aware
of
it
at
the
time
they
allegedly
surrendered
it.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
my
understanding
is
that
the
question
was
raised
at
the
trial,
and
that
testimony
was
taken
in
chambers.
the
officer
involved
gave
his
testimony,
and
i
believe,
that
there
was
other
testimony
given
by
joe
gonzales,
the
man
who
was
driving
the
automobile.
and
they
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
the
defendant
did
not
testify
and
mr.
--
as
i
mentioned
before,
mr.
alcala
did
not
testify.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
if
i
may
backtrack
a
little
bit.
the
actual
consent
was
given
by
mr.
alcala.
i
would
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
result
if
there
were
a
showing
that
he
was
aware
of
his
right
at
the
time
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
the
actual
--
the
man
that
gave
the
consent
was
joe
alcala.
he
had
apparently
borrowed
the
car
from
his
brother.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
he
did
not
testify.
but
he
was
the
man
who
did
give
the
consent.
all
of
the
evidence
involved
with
the
actual
conversation
is
based
upon
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
testimony
of
joe
gonzales
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
there
was
--
at
the
time
the
motion
was
made,
there
was
some
suggestion
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
that
the
search
was
not
properly
authorized,
that
mr.
alcala
was
not
aware
of
his
rights,
and
that
it
was
conducted
in
a
--
the
search
was
conducted
in
a
coercive
atmosphere.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i’m
afraid
i
can’t
answer
that,
sir.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
alcala
never
testified
at
all.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
he
was
not
called
by
the
defendant.
my
understanding,
and
i’ve
tried
to
communicate
with
the
attorney
who
handled
the
case
at
trial,
is
that
he
could
not
be
located.
they
made
an
effort,
but
could
not
locate
him
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
oh!
yes.
oh,
clearly.
clearly.
i
think
that
the
elements
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
i
do.
i
believe
that
in
order
to
make
any
of
the
other
safeguards
meaningful
and
worthwhile,
a
right
should
not
be
surrendered
unless
there’s
some
showing
that
the
individual
knew
it
existed.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
only
--
there
were
citations
issued,
traffic
citations
issued
to
the
driver.
so
far
as
i
know,
mr.
alcala
was
never
convicted
of
anything.
mr.
gonzales,
who
provided
the
main
testimony
in
connection
with
the
search,
other
than
that
provided
by
the
officer,
was
never
convicted.
i
believe
that,
as
i
mentioned,
that
the
effective
consent
is
to
make
all
of
the
traditional
fourth
amendment
safeguards,
including
the
emphasis
on
search
warrants
irrelevant.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
that’s
my
position.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that
question,
i
think,
is
obviously
a
difficult
one.
i
would
say
that
mr.
bustamonte
was
riding
in
the
car,
presumably
as
the
guest
of
--
pardon
me,
mr.
bustamonte
was
the
guest
of
mr.
alcala.
i
think
that
mr.
alcala’s
control
over
the
premises
could
be
deemed
satisfactory
so
that
if
he
consented
to
the
search,
the
search
would
be
valid.
i
would
quote
--
one
thing
i
would
—
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
yes.
in
my
case
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
right.
i
believe
that
otherwise
it
would
require
that
all
six
people
be
questioned,
and
i
think
again,
viewing
this
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no.
i
believe
that
the
authorization
from
this
search
resulted
from
mr.
alcala’s
alleged
consent.
that
was
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no.
i
believe
that
the
justification
for
the
search,
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
search
must
be
presented
by
the
state.
the
state
is
required
to
establish
the
basis
for
the
search,
and
i
think
that
what
it
must
do
is
demonstrate
the
elements
of
a
waiver
of
the
fourth
amendment
right.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
i
don’t.
i
think
that
the
same
question
could
be
asked
in
a
case
where,
for
example,
the
police
officer
says,
“can
i
see
your
driver’s
license?”
and
you
answer
“sure.”
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
you
say
“sure”
in
any
way
indicates
whether
you’ve
made
a
judgment
based
on
your
knowledge
of
the
alternatives
available
to
you
at
that
time.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
believe
that
the
assistance
rendered
by
mr.
alcala
is
partially
overstated.
after
all,
the
police
officer
asked,
according
to
mr.
gonzales,
i
believe
it’s
around
page
52,
he
asked,
“does
the
trunk
open?”
and
mr.
gonzales
said
that
mr.
alcala
said,
“yes,
it
does,”
and
walked
over
and
opened
it.
there’s
another
statement
where
he
says,
“how
about
opening
the
trunk?”
i
mean
these
are
the
statements
of
gonzales,
not
the
man
who
opened
the
trunk,
not
the
man
who
consented
to
the
search.
the
statement
of
gonzales,
the
man
who
was
driving
the
car.
the
man,
at
that
point,
was
17
or
18
years
old,
and
is
talking
about
a
conversation
that
he
overheard.
i
don’t
think
that
that
in
any
way
indicates
alcala’s
state
of
mind
at
that
particular
point.
i’d
also
like
to
mention
that
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
alcala
was
well
aware
that
the
checks
were
in
the
car,
either
on
the
possession
of
someone
in
the
car
or
in
the
car;
and
it
just
seems
to
me,
if
he
was
aware
of
his
rights,
it’s
curious
that
he
would
so
readily
authorize
the
police
to
search
that
car,
when
they
would
not
have
any
other
basis
to
do
so.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
not
that
i’m
aware
of.
what
happened
is
mr.
bustamonte,
on
his
own,
after
the
california
supreme
court
denied
the
petition
for
hearing,
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court.
he
did
this
without
the
assistance
of
counsel,
and
i
was
not
called
upon
to
assist
him
until
after
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
in
this
matter.
again
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
i
don’t,
sir.
i
think
that
--
although
i’d
like
to
reserve
some
discussion
at
that
point
on
the
second
part
of
the
argument,
i
think
that
this
court
in
fay
versus
noia
held
that
certiorari
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
normal
appellate
channel,
and
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
be
filed
as
a
precondition
to
seeking
federal
habeas
corpus.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
right,
overruled
dar
versus
burford,
which
had,
as
i
understand
it
required
that
such
a
petition
be
filed
prior
to
seeking
habeas
corpus.
again,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
has
a
real
direct
bearing
on
this
particular
case.
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
once
again,
what
i
think
to
be
the
most
important
aspect
to
this
case.
that
is
that
i’m
not
seeking
to
impose
what
i
feel
to
be
an
undue
burden
on
law
enforcement
officers.
after
all,
consent
searches
do
not
involve
probable
cause,
they
do
not
involve
emergencies,
they
do
not
involve
dangers
to
the
police.
the
sole
justification
for
the
search
is
the
suspect’s
invitation.
therefore,
i
submit
that
the
court
should
make
the
effort
to
determine
whether
a
knowledgeable
surrender
of
constitutional
rights
was
present
at
the
time
such
consent
is
given.
furthermore,
it
is
my
understanding
that
federal
agencies,
such
as
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs,
and
the
f.b.i.,
do
obtain
written
consents
before
conducting
a
search,
and
i
have
seen
one
of
the
forms
that
is
used
by
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs,
and
it
does
contain
a
statement
to
apprise
the
suspect
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
again,
i
don’t
believe
that
this
is
an
undue
burden
on
the
one
hand
for
the
police;
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
to
reject
the
waiver
test
would
be
to,
in
effect,
substantially
dilute
the
effectiveness
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
actually
remove
it,
actually
from
the
protections
of
many
citizens
of
this
country,
who
simply
are
not
aware
of
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
this
in
terms
of
what
are
the
police
most
likely
to
do.
if
the
police
have
a
probable
cause
to
seek
a
warrant,
i
think
that
this
court’s
decisions
indicate
that
they
should
take
that
tack.
that’s
the
preferred
way
to
do
it.
at
a
time
when
they’re
seeking
consent,
if
it
is,
in
fact,
a
search
that
can
only
be
justified
by
consent,
there
is
no
other
basis.
there
is
no
other
basis
for
the
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
don’t
believe
that
it
creates
a
difficulty
for
them
if
they
are
seeking
consent,
because
they
have
no
other
basis
for
the
search
to
make
it,
to
find
out
for
themselves
or
to
somehow
be
able
to
demonstrate
the
individual’s
awareness
of
his
rights
at
the
time
they
conduct
the
search.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
he
may
in
fact
do
that
on
many
occasions.
and
frankly
that
concerns
me,
because
that
means
that
whereas
the
police
officer
could
not
conduct
that
search
against
me,
for
example,
or
maybe
against
other
people
who
are
aware
of
their
rights,
he
would
be
able,
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
conduct
that
search
against
many
citizens
in
this
country
who
are
not
aware
of
their
rights.
i
do
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
ambiguities
and
difficulties
that
the
police
officer
must
face
up
to,
but
i
believe
that
unless
the
waiver
test
is
applied
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment,
the
result
would
be
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
police
can
conduct
searches
against
vast
segments
of
the
society
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
cannot
otherwise
conduct
and
that
they
could
not
conduct,
for
example,
against
people
who
are
aware
of
their
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
correct.
my
position
is
that
ker
versus
california,
although
it
did
not
establish
supervisory
authority
over
the
state
courts,
u.s.
supreme
court
supervisory
authority
over
the
state
courts,
it
did
clearly
indicate
that
certain
basic,
fundamental
criteria
must
be
met
in
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
basic
elements
--
one
of
the
most
basic
aspects
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
i
could
possibly
conceive
of.
is
the
right
to
be
available
to
all
citizens,
no
matter
if
they’re
uneducated,
educated,
sophisticated
or
unsophisticated,
or
is
it
not?
i
think
that
that’s
the
essential
question
and
is
fundamental
--
it
reaches
the
level
of
a
ker
versus
california
fundamental
criteria
in
my
opinion.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
that
--
i
can’t
conceive,
in
my
own
mind,
how
you
can
have
consent
to
something
unless
you
know
it
exists.
i
don’t
understand
how
you
can
surrender
something
unless
you
know
it
exists.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
right.
pardon
me,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
pardon
me,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
that’s
right.
my
argument
is
that
with
respect
to
their
interpretation
of
what
is
consent,
they
do
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
ker
versus
california.
in
truth,
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
believe
that
ker
versus
california
would
be
in
my
favor,
if
only
because
it
requires
that
certain
fundamental
safeguards
are
--
certain
fundamental
criteria
are
met
in
viewing
the
elements
of
a
constitutional
right.
the
state
has
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
offhand,
i
can’t
remember
the
passage
that
you’re
referring
to.
but,
again,
i
cite
ker
for
the
proposition
that
certain
minimal
criteria
must
be
met
by
the
state.
they
can
go
beyond
it,
but
they
can’t
fall
below
it.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
would
be
afraid
that
that
represents
some
sort
of
coercion,
just
a
suggestion
to
the
individual
that
“we
know
you’ve
got
it”
or
“do
you
have
it”;
that
would
concern
me.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
would
say
that
at
the
time
the
evidence,
if
in
fact
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
that
if
i’m
inviting,
if
i’m
inviting
an
officer,
for
example,
to
search
my
car,
if
it’s
a
true
invitation,
it
can
only
be
based
on
my
understanding
of
my
right
to
say
“it’s
none
of
your
business.”
“if
you’ve
got
a
basis
to
search
my
car,
go
ahead.”
but
i
don’t
have
to
let
you.
i
think
that
that’s
really
the
underlying
question
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
to
really
be
an
invitation,
means
that
i
know
i
can
say
no.
if
i
don’t
know
i
can
say
no,
i’m
being
forced
to
do
it.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i’m
saying
that
either
at
that
stage
or
at
trial,
some
evidence
would
have
to
be
adduced
to
demonstrate
that
the
individual
knew
he
could
say
no.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
turn
to
the
second
issue,
which
is,
should
state
prisoners
continue
to
have
access
to
federal
habeas
corpus
to
raise
fourth
amendment
claims.
the
state
requests
the
court
to
turn
its
back
on
the
extensive,
historical
development
of
habeas
corpus
as
a
remedy
to
vindicate
fundamental
constitutional
protection.
in
1969,
in
kaufman
versus
united
states,
this
court
held
that
federal
prisoners
can
use
federal
habeas
corpus
to
raise
fourth
amendment
claims,
even
though
such
claims
have
been
previously
considered
in
a
federal
court.
state
prisoners
have
an
even
greater
need
for
federal
habeas
corpus,
since
it
will
probably
be
their
first
opportunity
to
raise
their
federal
constitutional
claim
in
a
federal
court.
since
1916,
certiorari
has
been
the
only
direct
appellate
access
into
federal
courts
which
is
available
to
state
prisoners
under
normal
--
under
most
criminal
convictions.
again,
in
1963,
in
fay
versus
noia,
this
court
indicated
that
since
certiorari
is
by
no
means
the
equivalent
of
a
normal,
direct
appellate
channel,
there
is
no
need
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
as
a
precondition
to
seeking
federal
habeas
corpus.
today,
with
the
increased
workload
of
this
court,
certiorari
is
even
less
of
an
effective
direct
appellate
channel
than
it
was
when
fay
versus
noia
was
decided
back
in
1963.
thus
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
clear
that
the
state’s
real
goal
is
to
deprive
state
prisoners
of
any
meaningful
access
to
federal
courts
in
connection
with
their
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
court
indicated
its
firm
refusal
to
do
this
in
kaufman,
and
i
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
continue
to
reject
the
state’s
position
in
this
case.
federal
habeas
corpus
is
the
main
opportunity
for
careful,
consistent
federal
court
review
of
state
court
decisions
regarding
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fifty
state
supreme
courts
can
develop,
and
have
developed
in
the
past,
inconsistent
or
erroneous
rules
regarding
fundamental
constitutional
protections.
federal
habeas
corpus
provides
an
efficient,
effective
remedy
to
correct
those
errors.
it
guarantees
the
fair
and
equal
treatment
for
all
citizens,
wherever
tried,
with
respect
to
their
fundamental
constitutional
protections,
including
those
of
the
fourth
amendment.
clearly,
then,
federal
habeas
corpus
is
the
principle
remedy
available
to
implement
the
rule
of
ker
versus
california,
as
i
previously
stated
my
understanding
of
that
rule.
moreover,
and
although
i
will
admit
that
this
possibly
goes
beyond
the
narrow
scope
of
this
issue,
i
believe
that
federal
habeas
corpus
decisions
have
the
same
general
deterrent
effect
on
progressive
law
enforcement
departments
as
decisions
at
pretrial,
at
trial,
or
on
direct
appeal.
it
seems
to
me
it’s
one
thing
for
a
police
officer
who
conducted
a
particular
search,
or
the
particular
seizure,
to
see
that
he
lost
the
case
as
a
result
of
his
conduct;
possibly
that
will
affect
his
conduct,
possibly
it
will
not.
i
think
the
more
important
aspect
of
this
is
the
general
deterrent
value
of
all
court
decisions
dealing
with
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
that,
in
effect,
the
court
is
saying
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness,
a
standard
based
on
vindicating
the
individual’s
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
governmental
intrusions,
that
standard
of
reasonableness
prescribes
certain
rules,
certain
conduct
that
the
police
must
comply
with.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
with
respect
to
deterrents,
if
this
court,
in
this
case,
affirms
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
i
am
confident
that
all
around
the
country,
police
officers
will
recognize
that
in
order
to
sustain
a
conviction,
it
is
going
to
be
necessary
to
demonstrate
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
individual
who
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
absolutely.
i
think
that
the
fact
is
that
--
what
we’re
really
talking
about
is
conforming
conduct
to
a
set
of
criteria,
to
a
set
of
standards.
if
this
court
holds
that
a
conviction
cannot
be
sustained
on
the
basis
of
—
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
oh,
oh,
i’m
sorry.
my
statement
is
intended
as
a
statement
of
deterring
the
improper
conduct
in
the
future.
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
that’s
the
essential
element
of
this
case.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
pardon
me,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
think
the
ultimate
result
in
that
context
would
be
that
the
conviction
would
be
overturned,
presumably,
if
in
fact
we
had
all
of
the
other
elements.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
no,
no,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
i
believe
that
the
police
officer
would
ultimately
look
to
guidance
to
the
court
that
is
at
the
end
of
the
line,
that’s
going
to,
in
effect,
say
whether
this
conviction
can
stand
or
not.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
that’s
right.
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
it
may
draw
a
great
suspicion
on
him
to
do
that,
but
i
frankly
would
be
satisfied,
assuming
there
is
a
showing
that
it
was
in
fact
a
voluntary
act,
and
freely
he
decided
to
say,
“no,
you
can’t
search
the
car.”
mr.
stuart
p.
tobisman
well,
i
think
that
we’re
talking
again
about
the
other
side
of
the
issue,
which
is;
can
you
voluntarily
give
up
something
you
don’t
know
about,
that’s
one
side.
the
other
side
is;
are
you
really
voluntarily
saying
yes,
when
the
policeman
says,
“i
want
to
search
your
car.”
i
assume
that
you
can,
in
fact,
make
a
voluntary
decision
to
let
the
police
search
your
home,
let
the
police
search
your
car.
i
assume
that
that
can,
in
fact,
be
done.
but
my
position
is
that
it
can
be
only
done
if
you
are
aware
of
your
right
to
say
no.
