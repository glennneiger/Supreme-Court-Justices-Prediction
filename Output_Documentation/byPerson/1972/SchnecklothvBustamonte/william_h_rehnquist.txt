justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
granucci,
you
said
that
the
existence
of
a
confession
is
itself
evidence
that
the
miranda
rights
were
understood
and
waived,
whereas
the
production
of
tangible
goods
is
not.
i
don’t
think
i
quite
understand
your
distinctions,
at
least
stated
that
shortly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
at
least
part
of
your
contention
here
is
that
even
though
the
exclusionary
rule
is
constitutionally
derived,
in
a
case
such
as
harris,
decided
a
couple
of
years
ago,
there
was
a
limitation
on
its
application
in
some
aspects
of
the
adoption
of
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
that
limitation
be
broadened
to
cover
the
field
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tobisman,
as
a
practical
matter,
with
the
consent
standard
which
you’re
seeking
to
have
upheld
here,
mean
that
the
police
would
have
to
give
warnings
much
as
they
do
in
the
miranda
situation
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
alcala,
then
didn’t
take
the
stand
to
enlighten
anybody
about
the
state
of
his
knowledge
about
his
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tobisman,
it’s
my
understanding
that
your
opponent
takes
the
position
that
the
giving
of
warnings
for
a
fourth
amendment
situation
would
be
much,
much
more
complicated,
since
the
right
protected
is
the
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
rather
than
just
an
absolute
right
to
counsel.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
what
i
understand
to
be
his
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
judgment
as
to
whether
probable
cause
exists
or
whether
the
circumstances
are
exigent
is
necessarily
not
a
very
firm
one
and
in
many
doubtful
cases,
i
should
a
police
officer
might
be
approaching
with
the
thought,
“i
think
i’ve
got
probable
cause,
but
i’m
going
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
consent?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose,
mr.
tobisman
--
i’ll
try
to
restate
my
thought
on
mr.
justice
white’s
question.
suppose
we
hadn’t
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
and
you
have
a
judgment
from
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
says
this
search
is
perfectly
valid,
you
got
a
judgment
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
says
it’s
not
valid,
and
this
court
hasn’t
passed
on
it.
i
take
it
that’s
a
typical
habeas
situation,
where
your
lower
federal
courts
are
in
conflict
with
your
state
courts.
now,
where
does
the
police
officer
look
for
guidance
in
that
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
but
we’re
not
talking
about
the
conviction.
