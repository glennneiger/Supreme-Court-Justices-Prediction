justice
potter
stewart
now,
you’re
talking
about
the
exclusionary
rule
as
it
was
in
weeks
v.
united
states
or
people
v.
cahan,
whatever
the
case
was,
when
it
was
just
a
rule,
the
trouble
is
that
since
mapp
against
ohio
it’s
been
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
up
until
then
it
had
been
generally
understood,
at
least
by
me
and
i
think
by
other
people
that
it
was
simply
a
rule
of
evidence,
but
mapp
told
us
we
were
wrong
in
that
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that,
and
you
know
that
but
mapp
says
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth.
it
has
to
say
that,
doesn’t
it,
or
else
we
would
have
no
power
to
decide
mapp
the
way
we
decided
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
--
is
it
your
submission
that
the
court
should
retreat
from
kaufman
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
thorton
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
or
would
you
have
us
go
all
the
way
and
just
say
this
is
not
open
to
collateral
attack,
at
least
when
it’s
been
considered
by
the
state
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
anyway
the
thorton
case
was
discussed
a
good
deal
in
the
kaufman
opinion,
judge
leventhal’s
opinion
in
thorton?
justice
potter
stewart
shouldn’t
be
opened?
justice
potter
stewart
no
matter
how
it
reaches
from,
it
egregiously
outrages
the
search
and
seizure
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
broad
is
your
argument.
you
mean
from
what
you
just
said,
i
suppose,
it
would
militate
against
all
federal
habeas
corpus
jurisdictions?
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
the
exceptions
explicitly
enumerated
in
coolidge
--
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
the
exceptions
explicitly
enumerated
in
coolidge,
as
well
as
in
katz
and
other
cases,
if
you
want
to
call
it
an
exception,
was
that
the
search,
when
there
is
consent
to
the
search,
it
doesn’t
present
a
fourth
amendment
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
much
would
you
require?
justice
potter
stewart
you
wouldn’t
require
that
there
be
probable
cause,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
were
attacking
the
california
rule
as
to
what
is
consent,
as
consent
vel
non,
not
reasonableness
vel
non,
aren’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly,
so
you
are
attacking
the
california
test
of
consent
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
the
reasonableness.
