mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
ninth
circuit,
reversing
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
denying
mr.
bustamonte’s
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
questions
presented
are
one,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
invalid
a
search
based
upon
a
verbal
expression
of
consent
in
an
atmosphere
free
of
coercion,
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
state
had
failed
to
demonstrate
that
consent
was
given
with
knowledge
that
it
could
be
withheld.
the
second
point
is
somewhat
broader.
it
is,
whether
questions
relating
to
search
and
seizure
should
remain
available
to
state
prisoners
seeking
to
set
aside
a
final
conviction
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
a
jury
found
robert
clyde
bustamonte
guilty
of
possessing
a
completed
check
in
violation
---
completed
check
with
intent
to
defraud.
at
the
trial
three
stolen
and
forged
checks
were
admitted
into
evidence
over
defense
objection.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these.
on
january
19,
1967,
the
speedway
car
wash
in
mountain
view,
california,
a
town
about
30
miles
south
of
san
francisco,
was
burglarized.
a
number
of
blank
checks
and
a
check
protector
were
taken.
subsequently,
these
checks
were
completed
by
respondent
bustamonte,
using
the
check
protector
and
forging
the
car
wash
owner’s
name.
bustamonte,
together
with
joe
alcala
and
joe
gonzales,
then
set
out
to
cash
the
checks.
on
the
evening
of
january
30,
the
three
proceeded
to
san
jose,
to
find
persons
who
might
be
willing
to
use
false
identification
to
cash
the
checks
and
then
sharing
the
proceeds.
they
picked
up
three
men,
but
their
efforts
to
cash
the
checks
were
unsuccessful.
at
about
2:45
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
that
was
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
this
evidence
came
out
at
the
trial.
it
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
california
court
of
appeals.
at
2:45,
the
following
morning,
as
the
six
men
were
driving
along
the
highway,
a
police
officer
on
patrol
noticed
that
their
car
had
only
one
functioning
headlight.
he
made
a
u-turn
to
follow
the
car,
and
then
saw
that
it
had
no
rear
license
plate
light
either.
he
then
stopped
the
car.
gonzales
was
driving
and
alcala
and
bustamonte
were
in
the
front
seat.
three
other
men
were
in
the
rear.
gonzales
had
no
driver’s
license,
nor
any
identification.
neither
did
anybody
else,
except
mr.
alcala,
who
produced
his
driver’s
license
and
stated
that
the
car
belonged
to
his
brother.
the
officer
who
was
alone,
asked
the
men
to
step
out
of
the
car.
meanwhile,
he
had
called
for
a
backup
patrol.
after
the
officer
was
joined
by
two
other
police
officers,
he
asked
alcala
if
he
could
search
the
car.
alcala
replied,
“sure,
go
right
ahead.”
gonzales,
who
testified
at
the
trial,
corroborated
the
statement
and
testified
that
alcala
even
assisted
in
the
search.
in
the
search
the
officers
found
three
protectorized
checks,
wadded
up
under
the
rear
seat.
these
checks
were
payable
to
different
named
individuals.
later
on
a
search
warrant
was
obtained
to
search
bustamonte’s
own
two
automobiles.
there
the
searching
officers
found
other
blank
speedway
checks,
the
check
protector,
and
a
number
of
traffic
citations
relating
to
bustamonte.
the
writing
on
the
checks
was
that
of
bustamonte.
at
the
trial,
and
on
appeal
in
the
california
court
of
appeals,
our
intermediate
appellate
court,
bustamonte
contended
that
alcala’s
consent
for
search
was
invalid
because
alcala
had
not
been
warned
of
his
right
to
refuse
consent.
the
california
court
of
appeal
rejected
this
contention.
it
applied
the
established
state
standard
for
judging
consent
searches,
first
articulated
by
our
former
state
chief
justice,
roger
traynor,
the
author
of
california’s
exclusionary
rule,
declared
six
years
prior
to
mapp
v.
ohio.
and
this
is
the
california
consent
rule,
as
stated
by
justice
traynor,
“whether
in
a
particular
case
an
apparent
consent
was
in
fact
voluntarily
given
or
was
in
submission
to
an
express
or
implied
assertion
of
authority,
is
a
question
of
fact
to
be
determined
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances.”
here
the
california
court
of
appeal
concluded
that
the
consent
was
voluntarily
given,
because
it
was
verbally
stated
by
alcala,
in
response
to
a
request
for
permission
to
search.
there
is
no
overt
coercion,
nor
was
there
any
implied
assertion
of
authority.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeal
noted
that
the
atmosphere
at
the
time
of
the
car
stop
was
congenial.
the
california
supreme
court
then
denied
mr.
bustamonte’s
petition
for
a
discretionary
hearing
of
the
appeal.
in
may
1969,
bustamonte
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
petition
was
denied
on
february
10,
1970,
without
the
issuance
of
an
order
to
show
cause,
but
the
minutes
of
the
district
court
recite
that
the
federal
judge
had
before
him
the
opinion
of
the
california
court
of
appeal.
the
district
court
also
granted
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
and
leave
to
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
in
september
1971,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
vacated
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
remanded
the
matter
for
further
proceedings.
that
court
held
that
california
had
failed
to
show
that
the
consent
was
valid
because
there
was
no
specific
showing
that
alcala
knew
that
he
could
refuse
permission
to
search.
there
we
come
to
the
crux
of
the
problem.
california’s
consent
rule,
analogous
to
the
rule
articulated
by
this
court
prior
to
miranda
for
assessing
a
voluntariness
of
confessions,
makes
knowledge
of
one's
rights,
one
of
the
circumstances
to
be
considered
in
determining
voluntariness.
it
is
a
relative
fact,
but
it
is
not
the
determinative
fact,
it
is
only
one
of
the
circumstances.
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
makes
it
determinative.
it
has
substituted
its
waiver
standard
for
california’s
voluntariness
test.
in
effect,
it
held
that
justice
traynor’s
rule
for
assessing
voluntariness
was
unconstitutional.
so
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
not
the
relative
merits
of
the
ninth
circuit
waiver
of
rule,
or
the
california
voluntariness
rule.
the
question
is,
could
the
ninth
circuit
impose
its
federal
rule
on
the
state,
when
the
state
had
an
equally
valid
rule?
now,
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
absolute
in
its
terms.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
it
does
not
prohibit
all
searches,
only
unreasonable
searches.
the
conceptual
basis
of
the
california
consent
rule
is
simply
this.
it
is
not
unreasonable
for
an
officer
to
act
on
permission
to
search
granted
in
response
to
a
request
therefore,
under
circumstances
free
from
overt
coercion
or
any
implied
assertion
of
authority.
no
more
than
this
is
required.
since
we’re
judging
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment,
it’s
not
absolute,
it’s
relative
and
reasonableness
of
government
action
cannot,
and
it
should
not
be
judged
solely
by
the
affected
party’s
subjective
state
of
mind.
that
a
subjective
waiver
standard
is
inappropriate
in
fourth
amendment
cases,
becomes
clear
when
we
examine
three
distinct
lines
of
authority.
the
first
of
these
is
third-party
consent
cases.
as
recently
as
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire,
and
frazier
v.
cupp,
this
court,
with
little
if
any
division
on
the
point,
held
that
the
third
party
could
consent
to
a
search
of
a
subject’s
property
where
the
consent
was
given
under
circumstances
showing
it
was
voluntarily
given.
this
seems
to
me
to
militate
against
a
waiver
standard.
if
we
were
talking
about
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
surely
this
court
would
not
countenance
a
third
party’s
waiver
of
a
defendant’s
miranda
rights,
his
right
to
counsel,
or
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
indeed,
the
decision
in
boykin
v.
alabama
indicates
that
these
rights
must
be
waived
personally
by
the
defendant.
the
second
line
of
authority
consists
of
those
cases
including
hill
v.
california,
which
have
held
that
the
reasonableness
of
an
officer’s
actions
in
making
an
arrest
are
to
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
how
they
appeared
to
him
and
a
reasonable
mistake
of
fact
will
not
invalidate
an
arrest.
significantly,
in
stoner
v.
california,
referred
to
in
the
earlier
argument
this
morning,
the
court
rejected
the
purported
action
based
in
the
consent
of
a
hotel
clerk,
because
the
court
specifically
said,
the
police
could
not
reasonably
believe
that
the
hotel
clerk
had
authority
to
consent
to
the
search
of
the
room.
i
think,
conversely,
this
indicates
that
if
the
police
had
reasonably
believed
that
the
man
had
authority
to
consent,
the
court
would
have
sustained
their
actions.
and
the
third
line
of
cases
supporting
our
position
is
that
overwhelming
trend
of
authority
which
rejects
the
requirement
of
a
specific
warning
in
search
and
seizure
cases.
we
have
cited
them
in
the
brief,
they
are
quite
numerous.
now,
not
only
--
these
cases
are
significant,
because
wherever
this
court
has
imposed
a
waiver
standard,
the
necessity
of
a
warning
has
followed
shortly
thereafter.
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
not
requiring
warnings
in
consent
to
search
cases.
for
one
thing,
it
certainly
is
not
calculated
to
improve
police-community
relationships,
because
in
some
cases
police
do
ask
permission
to
search,
and
if
they
are
refused,
they
are
entitled
to
search
on
separate
grounds.
for
example,
exigency,
or
probable
cause
to
search
a
moving
vehicle.
also,
unlike
a
confession
case,
where
the
giving
of
a
confession
shortly
after
a
waiver
of
miranda
rights
is
itself
evidence
that
the
rights
were
understood
and
waived.
the
mere
existence
of
tangible
products
obtained
in
a
search
are
no
proof
that
a
warning
was
given
and
a
waiver
obtained.
third,
the
miranda
rule
was
intended
to
forestall
conditions
which
would
give
rise
to
coerced
confessions,
the
most
unreliable
kind
of
self-incriminating
evidence.
the
exclusionary
rule,
on
the
other
hand,
does
not
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact-finding
process.
finally,
although
this
was
discounted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
it
does
make
good
sense
to
say,
as
did
the
california
court
of
appeal
in
this
case,
that
when
permission
is
sought
from
a
person
of
ordinary
intelligence,
the
very
fact
that
consent
is
given
carries
the
implication
that
an
alternative
of
refusal
existed.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think,
perhaps
i
have
to
expand
them
a
bit.
where
an
officer
testifies
that
he
warned
the
suspect
and
gave
him
the
miranda
rights,
and
shortly
thereafter
a
confession
is
given
by
the
man,
by
the
suspect,
i
think
the
very
fact
of
the
confession
being
given
is
some
evidence
of
a
waiver.
now,
in
miranda,
the
court
said
you
can’t
produce
–
you
can't
presume
waiver
merely
from
a
silent,
from
merely
a
silent
record,
where
a
confession
is
given
without
a
warning,
but
when
it
follows
the
warning
i
think
it’s
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
confession
is
itself
some
evidence
of
waiver,
it
may
not
be
conclusive,
but
it’s
some
evidence.
whereas,
when
you
have
a
tangible
piece
of
property,
that
property
is
not
going
to
tell
you
whether
or
not
consent
to
search
was
given.
but
the
confession,
the
fact
of
the
confession
is
itself
some
evidence
of
waiver.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
that’s
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
ninth
circuit
discounted
that
by
saying
that
verbal
assent
is
not
enough.
in
our
view,
the
implication
apparently
relied
on
by
the
california
courts
can
hardly
suffice
as
a
general
rule.
under
many
circumstances,
a
reasonable
person
might
read
an
officer’s
“may
i”
as
the
courteous
expression
of
a
demand
backed
by
the
force
of
law.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
not.
and
if
i
might
correct
your
honor,
it
was
not
bustamonte
who
was
assisting
in
the
search,
it
was
mr.
alcala
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
--
the
one
who
had
borrowed
his
car
from
his
brother
for
this
expedition.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
he
had
the
driver’s
license.
gonzales
was
sitting
in
the
driver’s
seat,
driving
the
car.
alcala
was
sitting
in
the
middle.
he
had
the
driver’s
license
and
mr.
bustamonte
was
on
his
right
hand.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
and
it
did,
because
alcala
said,
“sure,
go
right
ahead”
and
then
he
searched
the
car.
and
then
when
he
helped
the
officer
search
the
car
and
i
can
refer
your
honor
to
page
51
of
our
appendix.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
under
california
law,
your
honor,
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
go
beyond
that,
because
under
california
law
a
driver
is
required
to
exhibit
his
license
whenever
an
officer
requests
it.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is,
your
honor,
a
polite
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
again
a
polite
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no.
there
may
or
may
not
be
an
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
the
difference
is
twofold.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
it
also,
i
think
--
i
also
think,
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
knowledge
of
california
drivers.
you
know,
in
our
state,
before
you
can
get
a
driver’s
license,
you
have
to
take
a
rather
comprehensive
examination
on
the
responsibility
of
drivers.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mostly,
yes.
but
there’s
nothing
in
any
of
the
california
driver’s
handbooks
that
says
you
have
to
consent
to
the
search
of
an
automobile,
although
they
do
say
that
the
driver
has
to
identify
himself
and
produce
his
license
when
requested
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
think
that’s
the
first
thing,
that
comes
to
mind,
we
do
feel
that
the
real
issue
is
--
we
don’t
preclude
the
possibility
of
unlawful
assertion
of
authority.
the
real
question
is
how
you
judge
it.
do
you
focus
on
the
affected
party’s
state
of
mind
as
the
ninth
circuit
did,
or
can
you
take
justice
traynor’s
point
of
view
and
look
at
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case?
and
we
say
it’s
perfectly
valid
to
take
the
voluntariness
approach.
we
take
the
same
approach
in
california
that
this
court
took
in
bumper
v.
north
carolina.
there,
based
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
court
found
there
was
an
implied
assertion
of
authority.
they
did
not
--
the
court
did
not
focus
on
the
lady’s
subjective
state
of
mind.
they
just
said
that
under
these
circumstances
we
have
an
implied
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it’s
in
the
appendix.
it’s
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
and
the
appendix
contains
the
--
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
on
the
objection
to
these
three
checks.
now,
we
say
that
the
california
objective
voluntariness
rule
is
constitutional,
and
when
the
ninth
circuit
held
it
unconstitutional
and
imposed
its
federal
standard,
it
not
only
raised
questions
about
the
correctness
of
that
rule,
but
about
the
system
of
jurisprudence
that
makes
that
kind
of
thing
possible.
this
leads
us
to
our
second
argument.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no.
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
on
our
second
point,
it’s
agreed
by
both
proponents
and
critics
of
the
exclusionary
rule
that
its
primary
purpose
is
to
deter
unreasonable
police
action.
whether
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
at
the
trial,
and
on
the
appeal
in
fact
does
so,
is
a
hotly
debated
question.
but
we
insist
most
strongly
that
whatever
deterrent
value
the
rule
may
have
on
trial
and
on
direct
review,
its
deterrent
effect
is
totally
attenuated
by
the
time
we
get
to
collateral
attack.
basically,
in
our
second
argument,
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
is
to
tailor
the
impact
on
the
state
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
to
fit
the
purposes
it
was
intended
to
serve.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
conceptually
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
itself
contains
no
explicit
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
exactly.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
exactly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
think
kaufman
--
i
respectfully
submit
that
kaufman
was
wrong,
was
because
kaufman
didn’t
have
the
advantage
of
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
harris
v.
new
york.
miranda
may
be
constitutionally
compelled
too,
but
the
court
still
held
that
in
assessing
the
use
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
i
do.
i
ask
the
court
to
take
a
balancing
test,
weigh
deterrent
value
against
real
substantial
detriment
involved
to
the
states
on
collateral
attack.
it
would
take
much
more
time
than
the
rules
of
this
court
allow,
to
fully
illustrate
all
of
the
disadvantages.
they’re
cited
by
the
commentators.
they’re
cited
in
our
brief.
but
one
of
the
real
disadvantages
that
i
wasn’t
aware
of
until
we
came
to
argue
this
case
was
that
it
gives
the
federal
courts
an
opportunity
to
impose
federal
standards
on
the
states
in
place
of
their
equally
valid
state
standards
for
judging
constitutional
questions.
now,
i
can
conclude
the
prepared
portion
of
my
argument
in
no
better
way
than
referring
this
court
to
the
words
of
late
associate
justice
harlan,
who
described
collateral
attack
on
exclusionary
rule
grounds
as
imposing
a
burden
on
the
judiciary
and
on
society
at
large,
which
results
in
no
legitimate
benefit
to
the
habeas
petitioner
and
does
nothing
to
serve
the
interest
of
justice
and
i
will
respectfully
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
be
kept
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
would
go
all
the
way
and
say
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
i
think
i
recall
that.
i
would
go
all
the
way
and
say
it
shouldn’t
be
raised.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
shouldn’t
be
opened.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that’s
the
position
i
have
to
take,
but
to
ameliorate
that,
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
early
1960’s
almost
guaranteed
adequate
state
process
for
the
vindication
of
federal
claims,
by
providing
each
defendant
with
an
attorney,
with
a
specific
procedure
for
raising
constitutional
questions.
i
refer
to
the
new
york
confessions
case.
with
counsel
on
appeal,
with
a
record
on
appeal.
basically,
opponents
of
our
position
have
made
some
very
delicately
phrased
arguments,
mainly
to
the
effect
that
ultimately
you
have
to
vindicate
federal
rights
in
a
federal
tribunal.
but
when
they
boil
it
down
to
essentials,
they
mean
this
and
only
one
thing,
that
states
courts
cannot
be
trusted
with
federal
rights
and
that
assumption
is
wrong.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it
would.
federal
habeas
jurisdiction
is
also
a
very
controversial
thing.
but
--
and
a
stronger
case
can
perhaps
be
made
for
it,
where
the
error
complained
of
goes
to
guilt
or
innocence;
but
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
go
to
guilt
or
innocence.
its
purpose
is
totally
collateral
to
the
criminal
trial.
when
a
habeas
petitioner,
by
asserting
the
exclusionary
rule,
wins
a
reversal
or
a
new
trial,
he
gets
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
guilt
or
innocence,
or
the
amount
of
his
rehabilitation,
or
any
personal
merit
of
his.
one
would
think
that,
you
know,
you’d
expect
to
find
enormous
compensating
benefits,
in
order
to
tolerate
such
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
because
that’s
what
it
is,
when
a
man
gets
out
on
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence.
i’ll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
commence
by
noting
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
last
question
is
not
a
hypothetical
one.
it
describes
a
real
and
very
disturbing
situation
is
the
ninth
circuit,
where
that
court,
in
some
of
the
cases
cited
in
out
brief,
has
applied
its
own
waiver
standard
in
cases
brought
by
state
prisoners.
whereas
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
california
has
declared
that
consent
to
search
is
to
be
judged
by
a
voluntariness
standard.
now,
let
me
step
back
and
clarify
one
thing,
if
i
haven’t
done
so.
we
do
not
say
that
simple
consent
to
search
is
sufficient.
california
courts
are
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
an
implied
assertion
of
authority.
they
are
very
concerned
about
it.
the
question
is,
how
do
we
judge?
how
do
we
--
what
means
do
we
invoke
to
judge
the
question
of
implied
assertion
of
authority?
california
uses
objective
circumstances,
and
it’s
a
constitutional
rule.
now,
counsel
observed
that
alcala
wouldn’t
have
consented
to
this
search
if
he
thought
he
could
refuse.
well,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
some
good
reasons
why
alcala
might
want
to
consent,
even
if
he
knew
the
checks
were
in
the
car.
he
could
very
well
feel,
“well,
they
have
stopped
us
and
they’ve
got
us.
and
if
they
find
the
checks,
they
won’t
find
them
on
me,
and
i
can
always
say
later
on,
i
didn’t
know
they
were
in
the
car.”
and
the
consent,
“the
fact
that
i
consented
would
be
some
indication
that
i
didn’t
know.”
now,
as
far
as
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
that’s
right,
your
honor.
although
i
would
say
this,
that
if
you
had
drawn
guns
or
something
like
that,
that’s
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
you
see,
in
other
words,
we
look
for
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
sir,
it
isn’t.
verbal
expression
of
permission
to
search.
then
you
look
for
no
implied
assertion
of
authority,
and
of
course
no
overt
coercion.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it
might
be
a
different
case.
this
would
be
another
of
the
factors
that
we
would
throw
into
the
equation
of
measuring
voluntariness.
knowledge
of
one’s
rights
is
a
relevant
fact,
but
it’s
not
a
determinative.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
well,
it’s
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
officer,
on
his
instinct,
thought,
“well,
here
we
are,
it’s
2:45
in
the
morning,
we
have
three
young
men
in
the
front
seat,
three
older
men
in
the
back
seat,
nobody
has
got
any
identification
except
alcala,
and
they’ve
all
given
inconsistent
stories
about
who
picked
who
up,
and
where
they
were
going."
some
instinct
told
him
that
things
were
not
exactly
all
right,
although
he
couldn’t
pin
it
down
to
a
specific
crime.
so
he
asked
permission
to
search.
he
pretty
well
articulated
his
mental
thinking.
it
was
a
policeman’s
hunch.
we
don’t
say
that
it
would
have
justified
the
search
of
the
car
without
consent,
but
it
certainly
made
it
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
ask
mr.
alcala
for
permission.
now,
i’ll
respectfully
submit
the
matter.
my
time
is
up,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
ninth
circuit,
reversing
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
denying
mr.
bustamonte’s
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
questions
presented
are
one,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
invalid
a
search
based
upon
a
verbal
expression
of
consent
in
an
atmosphere
free
of
coercion,
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
state
had
failed
to
demonstrate
that
consent
was
given
with
knowledge
that
it
could
be
withheld.
the
second
point
is
somewhat
broader.
it
is,
whether
questions
relating
to
search
and
seizure
should
remain
available
to
state
prisoners
seeking
to
set
aside
a
final
conviction
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
a
jury
found
robert
clyde
bustamonte
guilty
of
possessing
a
completed
check
in
violation
---
completed
check
with
intent
to
defraud.
at
the
trial
three
stolen
and
forged
checks
were
admitted
into
evidence
over
defense
objection.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these.
on
january
19,
1967,
the
speedway
car
wash
in
mountain
view,
california,
a
town
about
30
miles
south
of
san
francisco,
was
burglarized.
a
number
of
blank
checks
and
a
check
protector
were
taken.
subsequently,
these
checks
were
completed
by
respondent
bustamonte,
using
the
check
protector
and
forging
the
car
wash
owner’s
name.
bustamonte,
together
with
joe
alcala
and
joe
gonzales,
then
set
out
to
cash
the
checks.
on
the
evening
of
january
30,
the
three
proceeded
to
san
jose,
to
find
persons
who
might
be
willing
to
use
false
identification
to
cash
the
checks
and
then
sharing
the
proceeds.
they
picked
up
three
men,
but
their
efforts
to
cash
the
checks
were
unsuccessful.
at
about
2:45
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
that
was
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
this
evidence
came
out
at
the
trial.
it
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
california
court
of
appeals.
at
2:45,
the
following
morning,
as
the
six
men
were
driving
along
the
highway,
a
police
officer
on
patrol
noticed
that
their
car
had
only
one
functioning
headlight.
he
made
a
u-turn
to
follow
the
car,
and
then
saw
that
it
had
no
rear
license
plate
light
either.
he
then
stopped
the
car.
gonzales
was
driving
and
alcala
and
bustamonte
were
in
the
front
seat.
three
other
men
were
in
the
rear.
gonzales
had
no
driver’s
license,
nor
any
identification.
neither
did
anybody
else,
except
mr.
alcala,
who
produced
his
driver’s
license
and
stated
that
the
car
belonged
to
his
brother.
the
officer
who
was
alone,
asked
the
men
to
step
out
of
the
car.
meanwhile,
he
had
called
for
a
backup
patrol.
after
the
officer
was
joined
by
two
other
police
officers,
he
asked
alcala
if
he
could
search
the
car.
alcala
replied,
“sure,
go
right
ahead.”
gonzales,
who
testified
at
the
trial,
corroborated
the
statement
and
testified
that
alcala
even
assisted
in
the
search.
in
the
search
the
officers
found
three
protectorized
checks,
wadded
up
under
the
rear
seat.
these
checks
were
payable
to
different
named
individuals.
later
on
a
search
warrant
was
obtained
to
search
bustamonte’s
own
two
automobiles.
there
the
searching
officers
found
other
blank
speedway
checks,
the
check
protector,
and
a
number
of
traffic
citations
relating
to
bustamonte.
the
writing
on
the
checks
was
that
of
bustamonte.
at
the
trial,
and
on
appeal
in
the
california
court
of
appeals,
our
intermediate
appellate
court,
bustamonte
contended
that
alcala’s
consent
for
search
was
invalid
because
alcala
had
not
been
warned
of
his
right
to
refuse
consent.
the
california
court
of
appeal
rejected
this
contention.
it
applied
the
established
state
standard
for
judging
consent
searches,
first
articulated
by
our
former
state
chief
justice,
roger
traynor,
the
author
of
california’s
exclusionary
rule,
declared
six
years
prior
to
mapp
v.
ohio.
and
this
is
the
california
consent
rule,
as
stated
by
justice
traynor,
“whether
in
a
particular
case
an
apparent
consent
was
in
fact
voluntarily
given
or
was
in
submission
to
an
express
or
implied
assertion
of
authority,
is
a
question
of
fact
to
be
determined
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances.”
here
the
california
court
of
appeal
concluded
that
the
consent
was
voluntarily
given,
because
it
was
verbally
stated
by
alcala,
in
response
to
a
request
for
permission
to
search.
there
is
no
overt
coercion,
nor
was
there
any
implied
assertion
of
authority.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeal
noted
that
the
atmosphere
at
the
time
of
the
car
stop
was
congenial.
the
california
supreme
court
then
denied
mr.
bustamonte’s
petition
for
a
discretionary
hearing
of
the
appeal.
in
may
1969,
bustamonte
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
petition
was
denied
on
february
10,
1970,
without
the
issuance
of
an
order
to
show
cause,
but
the
minutes
of
the
district
court
recite
that
the
federal
judge
had
before
him
the
opinion
of
the
california
court
of
appeal.
the
district
court
also
granted
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
and
leave
to
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
in
september
1971,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
vacated
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
remanded
the
matter
for
further
proceedings.
that
court
held
that
california
had
failed
to
show
that
the
consent
was
valid
because
there
was
no
specific
showing
that
alcala
knew
that
he
could
refuse
permission
to
search.
there
we
come
to
the
crux
of
the
problem.
california’s
consent
rule,
analogous
to
the
rule
articulated
by
this
court
prior
to
miranda
for
assessing
a
voluntariness
of
confessions,
makes
knowledge
of
one's
rights,
one
of
the
circumstances
to
be
considered
in
determining
voluntariness.
it
is
a
relative
fact,
but
it
is
not
the
determinative
fact,
it
is
only
one
of
the
circumstances.
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
makes
it
determinative.
it
has
substituted
its
waiver
standard
for
california’s
voluntariness
test.
in
effect,
it
held
that
justice
traynor’s
rule
for
assessing
voluntariness
was
unconstitutional.
so
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
not
the
relative
merits
of
the
ninth
circuit
waiver
of
rule,
or
the
california
voluntariness
rule.
the
question
is,
could
the
ninth
circuit
impose
its
federal
rule
on
the
state,
when
the
state
had
an
equally
valid
rule?
now,
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
absolute
in
its
terms.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
it
does
not
prohibit
all
searches,
only
unreasonable
searches.
the
conceptual
basis
of
the
california
consent
rule
is
simply
this.
it
is
not
unreasonable
for
an
officer
to
act
on
permission
to
search
granted
in
response
to
a
request
therefore,
under
circumstances
free
from
overt
coercion
or
any
implied
assertion
of
authority.
no
more
than
this
is
required.
since
we’re
judging
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment,
it’s
not
absolute,
it’s
relative
and
reasonableness
of
government
action
cannot,
and
it
should
not
be
judged
solely
by
the
affected
party’s
subjective
state
of
mind.
that
a
subjective
waiver
standard
is
inappropriate
in
fourth
amendment
cases,
becomes
clear
when
we
examine
three
distinct
lines
of
authority.
the
first
of
these
is
third-party
consent
cases.
as
recently
as
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire,
and
frazier
v.
cupp,
this
court,
with
little
if
any
division
on
the
point,
held
that
the
third
party
could
consent
to
a
search
of
a
subject’s
property
where
the
consent
was
given
under
circumstances
showing
it
was
voluntarily
given.
this
seems
to
me
to
militate
against
a
waiver
standard.
if
we
were
talking
about
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
surely
this
court
would
not
countenance
a
third
party’s
waiver
of
a
defendant’s
miranda
rights,
his
right
to
counsel,
or
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
indeed,
the
decision
in
boykin
v.
alabama
indicates
that
these
rights
must
be
waived
personally
by
the
defendant.
the
second
line
of
authority
consists
of
those
cases
including
hill
v.
california,
which
have
held
that
the
reasonableness
of
an
officer’s
actions
in
making
an
arrest
are
to
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
how
they
appeared
to
him
and
a
reasonable
mistake
of
fact
will
not
invalidate
an
arrest.
significantly,
in
stoner
v.
california,
referred
to
in
the
earlier
argument
this
morning,
the
court
rejected
the
purported
action
based
in
the
consent
of
a
hotel
clerk,
because
the
court
specifically
said,
the
police
could
not
reasonably
believe
that
the
hotel
clerk
had
authority
to
consent
to
the
search
of
the
room.
i
think,
conversely,
this
indicates
that
if
the
police
had
reasonably
believed
that
the
man
had
authority
to
consent,
the
court
would
have
sustained
their
actions.
and
the
third
line
of
cases
supporting
our
position
is
that
overwhelming
trend
of
authority
which
rejects
the
requirement
of
a
specific
warning
in
search
and
seizure
cases.
we
have
cited
them
in
the
brief,
they
are
quite
numerous.
now,
not
only
--
these
cases
are
significant,
because
wherever
this
court
has
imposed
a
waiver
standard,
the
necessity
of
a
warning
has
followed
shortly
thereafter.
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
not
requiring
warnings
in
consent
to
search
cases.
for
one
thing,
it
certainly
is
not
calculated
to
improve
police-community
relationships,
because
in
some
cases
police
do
ask
permission
to
search,
and
if
they
are
refused,
they
are
entitled
to
search
on
separate
grounds.
for
example,
exigency,
or
probable
cause
to
search
a
moving
vehicle.
also,
unlike
a
confession
case,
where
the
giving
of
a
confession
shortly
after
a
waiver
of
miranda
rights
is
itself
evidence
that
the
rights
were
understood
and
waived.
the
mere
existence
of
tangible
products
obtained
in
a
search
are
no
proof
that
a
warning
was
given
and
a
waiver
obtained.
third,
the
miranda
rule
was
intended
to
forestall
conditions
which
would
give
rise
to
coerced
confessions,
the
most
unreliable
kind
of
self-incriminating
evidence.
the
exclusionary
rule,
on
the
other
hand,
does
not
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact-finding
process.
finally,
although
this
was
discounted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
it
does
make
good
sense
to
say,
as
did
the
california
court
of
appeal
in
this
case,
that
when
permission
is
sought
from
a
person
of
ordinary
intelligence,
the
very
fact
that
consent
is
given
carries
the
implication
that
an
alternative
of
refusal
existed.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think,
perhaps
i
have
to
expand
them
a
bit.
where
an
officer
testifies
that
he
warned
the
suspect
and
gave
him
the
miranda
rights,
and
shortly
thereafter
a
confession
is
given
by
the
man,
by
the
suspect,
i
think
the
very
fact
of
the
confession
being
given
is
some
evidence
of
a
waiver.
now,
in
miranda,
the
court
said
you
can’t
produce
–
you
can't
presume
waiver
merely
from
a
silent,
from
merely
a
silent
record,
where
a
confession
is
given
without
a
warning,
but
when
it
follows
the
warning
i
think
it’s
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
confession
is
itself
some
evidence
of
waiver,
it
may
not
be
conclusive,
but
it’s
some
evidence.
whereas,
when
you
have
a
tangible
piece
of
property,
that
property
is
not
going
to
tell
you
whether
or
not
consent
to
search
was
given.
but
the
confession,
the
fact
of
the
confession
is
itself
some
evidence
of
waiver.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
that’s
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
ninth
circuit
discounted
that
by
saying
that
verbal
assent
is
not
enough.
in
our
view,
the
implication
apparently
relied
on
by
the
california
courts
can
hardly
suffice
as
a
general
rule.
under
many
circumstances,
a
reasonable
person
might
read
an
officer’s
“may
i”
as
the
courteous
expression
of
a
demand
backed
by
the
force
of
law.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
not.
and
if
i
might
correct
your
honor,
it
was
not
bustamonte
who
was
assisting
in
the
search,
it
was
mr.
alcala
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
--
the
one
who
had
borrowed
his
car
from
his
brother
for
this
expedition.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
he
had
the
driver’s
license.
gonzales
was
sitting
in
the
driver’s
seat,
driving
the
car.
alcala
was
sitting
in
the
middle.
he
had
the
driver’s
license
and
mr.
bustamonte
was
on
his
right
hand.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
and
it
did,
because
alcala
said,
“sure,
go
right
ahead”
and
then
he
searched
the
car.
and
then
when
he
helped
the
officer
search
the
car
and
i
can
refer
your
honor
to
page
51
of
our
appendix.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
under
california
law,
your
honor,
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
go
beyond
that,
because
under
california
law
a
driver
is
required
to
exhibit
his
license
whenever
an
officer
requests
it.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is,
your
honor,
a
polite
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
again
a
polite
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no.
there
may
or
may
not
be
an
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
the
difference
is
twofold.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
it
also,
i
think
--
i
also
think,
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
knowledge
of
california
drivers.
you
know,
in
our
state,
before
you
can
get
a
driver’s
license,
you
have
to
take
a
rather
comprehensive
examination
on
the
responsibility
of
drivers.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mostly,
yes.
but
there’s
nothing
in
any
of
the
california
driver’s
handbooks
that
says
you
have
to
consent
to
the
search
of
an
automobile,
although
they
do
say
that
the
driver
has
to
identify
himself
and
produce
his
license
when
requested
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
think
that’s
the
first
thing,
that
comes
to
mind,
we
do
feel
that
the
real
issue
is
--
we
don’t
preclude
the
possibility
of
unlawful
assertion
of
authority.
the
real
question
is
how
you
judge
it.
do
you
focus
on
the
affected
party’s
state
of
mind
as
the
ninth
circuit
did,
or
can
you
take
justice
traynor’s
point
of
view
and
look
at
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case?
and
we
say
it’s
perfectly
valid
to
take
the
voluntariness
approach.
we
take
the
same
approach
in
california
that
this
court
took
in
bumper
v.
north
carolina.
there,
based
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
court
found
there
was
an
implied
assertion
of
authority.
they
did
not
--
the
court
did
not
focus
on
the
lady’s
subjective
state
of
mind.
they
just
said
that
under
these
circumstances
we
have
an
implied
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it’s
in
the
appendix.
it’s
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
and
the
appendix
contains
the
--
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
on
the
objection
to
these
three
checks.
now,
we
say
that
the
california
objective
voluntariness
rule
is
constitutional,
and
when
the
ninth
circuit
held
it
unconstitutional
and
imposed
its
federal
standard,
it
not
only
raised
questions
about
the
correctness
of
that
rule,
but
about
the
system
of
jurisprudence
that
makes
that
kind
of
thing
possible.
this
leads
us
to
our
second
argument.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no.
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
on
our
second
point,
it’s
agreed
by
both
proponents
and
critics
of
the
exclusionary
rule
that
its
primary
purpose
is
to
deter
unreasonable
police
action.
whether
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
at
the
trial,
and
on
the
appeal
in
fact
does
so,
is
a
hotly
debated
question.
but
we
insist
most
strongly
that
whatever
deterrent
value
the
rule
may
have
on
trial
and
on
direct
review,
its
deterrent
effect
is
totally
attenuated
by
the
time
we
get
to
collateral
attack.
basically,
in
our
second
argument,
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
is
to
tailor
the
impact
on
the
state
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
to
fit
the
purposes
it
was
intended
to
serve.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
conceptually
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
itself
contains
no
explicit
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
exactly.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
exactly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
think
kaufman
--
i
respectfully
submit
that
kaufman
was
wrong,
was
because
kaufman
didn’t
have
the
advantage
of
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
harris
v.
new
york.
miranda
may
be
constitutionally
compelled
too,
but
the
court
still
held
that
in
assessing
the
use
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
i
do.
i
ask
the
court
to
take
a
balancing
test,
weigh
deterrent
value
against
real
substantial
detriment
involved
to
the
states
on
collateral
attack.
it
would
take
much
more
time
than
the
rules
of
this
court
allow,
to
fully
illustrate
all
of
the
disadvantages.
they’re
cited
by
the
commentators.
they’re
cited
in
our
brief.
but
one
of
the
real
disadvantages
that
i
wasn’t
aware
of
until
we
came
to
argue
this
case
was
that
it
gives
the
federal
courts
an
opportunity
to
impose
federal
standards
on
the
states
in
place
of
their
equally
valid
state
standards
for
judging
constitutional
questions.
now,
i
can
conclude
the
prepared
portion
of
my
argument
in
no
better
way
than
referring
this
court
to
the
words
of
late
associate
justice
harlan,
who
described
collateral
attack
on
exclusionary
rule
grounds
as
imposing
a
burden
on
the
judiciary
and
on
society
at
large,
which
results
in
no
legitimate
benefit
to
the
habeas
petitioner
and
does
nothing
to
serve
the
interest
of
justice
and
i
will
respectfully
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
be
kept
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
would
go
all
the
way
and
say
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
i
think
i
recall
that.
i
would
go
all
the
way
and
say
it
shouldn’t
be
raised.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
shouldn’t
be
opened.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that’s
the
position
i
have
to
take,
but
to
ameliorate
that,
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
early
1960’s
almost
guaranteed
adequate
state
process
for
the
vindication
of
federal
claims,
by
providing
each
defendant
with
an
attorney,
with
a
specific
procedure
for
raising
constitutional
questions.
i
refer
to
the
new
york
confessions
case.
with
counsel
on
appeal,
with
a
record
on
appeal.
basically,
opponents
of
our
position
have
made
some
very
delicately
phrased
arguments,
mainly
to
the
effect
that
ultimately
you
have
to
vindicate
federal
rights
in
a
federal
tribunal.
but
when
they
boil
it
down
to
essentials,
they
mean
this
and
only
one
thing,
that
states
courts
cannot
be
trusted
with
federal
rights
and
that
assumption
is
wrong.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it
would.
federal
habeas
jurisdiction
is
also
a
very
controversial
thing.
but
--
and
a
stronger
case
can
perhaps
be
made
for
it,
where
the
error
complained
of
goes
to
guilt
or
innocence;
but
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
go
to
guilt
or
innocence.
its
purpose
is
totally
collateral
to
the
criminal
trial.
when
a
habeas
petitioner,
by
asserting
the
exclusionary
rule,
wins
a
reversal
or
a
new
trial,
he
gets
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
guilt
or
innocence,
or
the
amount
of
his
rehabilitation,
or
any
personal
merit
of
his.
one
would
think
that,
you
know,
you’d
expect
to
find
enormous
compensating
benefits,
in
order
to
tolerate
such
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
because
that’s
what
it
is,
when
a
man
gets
out
on
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence.
i’ll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
commence
by
noting
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
last
question
is
not
a
hypothetical
one.
it
describes
a
real
and
very
disturbing
situation
is
the
ninth
circuit,
where
that
court,
in
some
of
the
cases
cited
in
out
brief,
has
applied
its
own
waiver
standard
in
cases
brought
by
state
prisoners.
whereas
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
california
has
declared
that
consent
to
search
is
to
be
judged
by
a
voluntariness
standard.
now,
let
me
step
back
and
clarify
one
thing,
if
i
haven’t
done
so.
we
do
not
say
that
simple
consent
to
search
is
sufficient.
california
courts
are
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
an
implied
assertion
of
authority.
they
are
very
concerned
about
it.
the
question
is,
how
do
we
judge?
how
do
we
--
what
means
do
we
invoke
to
judge
the
question
of
implied
assertion
of
authority?
california
uses
objective
circumstances,
and
it’s
a
constitutional
rule.
now,
counsel
observed
that
alcala
wouldn’t
have
consented
to
this
search
if
he
thought
he
could
refuse.
well,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
some
good
reasons
why
alcala
might
want
to
consent,
even
if
he
knew
the
checks
were
in
the
car.
he
could
very
well
feel,
“well,
they
have
stopped
us
and
they’ve
got
us.
and
if
they
find
the
checks,
they
won’t
find
them
on
me,
and
i
can
always
say
later
on,
i
didn’t
know
they
were
in
the
car.”
and
the
consent,
“the
fact
that
i
consented
would
be
some
indication
that
i
didn’t
know.”
now,
as
far
as
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
that’s
right,
your
honor.
although
i
would
say
this,
that
if
you
had
drawn
guns
or
something
like
that,
that’s
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
you
see,
in
other
words,
we
look
for
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
sir,
it
isn’t.
verbal
expression
of
permission
to
search.
then
you
look
for
no
implied
assertion
of
authority,
and
of
course
no
overt
coercion.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it
might
be
a
different
case.
this
would
be
another
of
the
factors
that
we
would
throw
into
the
equation
of
measuring
voluntariness.
knowledge
of
one’s
rights
is
a
relevant
fact,
but
it’s
not
a
determinative.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
well,
it’s
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
officer,
on
his
instinct,
thought,
“well,
here
we
are,
it’s
2:45
in
the
morning,
we
have
three
young
men
in
the
front
seat,
three
older
men
in
the
back
seat,
nobody
has
got
any
identification
except
alcala,
and
they’ve
all
given
inconsistent
stories
about
who
picked
who
up,
and
where
they
were
going."
some
instinct
told
him
that
things
were
not
exactly
all
right,
although
he
couldn’t
pin
it
down
to
a
specific
crime.
so
he
asked
permission
to
search.
he
pretty
well
articulated
his
mental
thinking.
it
was
a
policeman’s
hunch.
we
don’t
say
that
it
would
have
justified
the
search
of
the
car
without
consent,
but
it
certainly
made
it
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
ask
mr.
alcala
for
permission.
now,
i’ll
respectfully
submit
the
matter.
my
time
is
up,
your
honors.
