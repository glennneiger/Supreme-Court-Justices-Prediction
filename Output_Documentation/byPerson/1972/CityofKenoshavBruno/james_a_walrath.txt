mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
some
of
the
points
that
have
risen
during
the
course
of
mr.
dalton’s
argument.
first
of
all,
the
argument
is
made
that
these
two
municipalities
have
been
enjoined
under
all
circumstances
from
denying
when
a
--
license
renewals
that
they
have
been
foreclosed
from
in
any
way
taking
these
licenses
away
from
the
individual
appellees
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
situation
and
i
would
refer
the
court
specifically
to
page
55
of
the
appendix
which
contains
a
statement
of
the
summary
judgment
order
of
the
district
court
which
indicates
that
the
municipalities
are
free
to
act
on
the
applications
at
such
time
that
their
actions
are
commensurate
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so,
the
municipalities
are
not
foreclosed
from
considering
these
applications
or
denying
them,
should
they
follow
the
procedures
which
were
outlined
by
the
three-judge
court
below.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
our
position
is,
your
honor,
that
they
could
not
and
that
was
the
next
point
i
want
to
raise.
the
procedures
which
must
be
followed
now,
i
have
specific
reference,
first
of
all,
to
when
a
liquor
license
as
opposed
to
a
beer
license
or
malt
beverage
license
is
not
renewed.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
would
submit
that
he
is
not
because
both
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
okay.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
liquor
licenses
are
concerned,
when
a
liquor
license
application
is
not
renewed,
the
remedy,
exclusive
remedy,
as
i
understand
it
under
wisconsin
law
is
by
certiorari
and
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
all
on
handwritten
notes
or
typed
notes
by
city
clerks,
whatever
is
there.
in
the
present
situation
there
was
very
little
of
any
sort
of
record
as
far
as
what
statements
were
made
at
the
hearings.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
there
definitely
is
no
entitlement
to
a
trial
de
novo,
excuse
me.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
on
certiorari,
the
only
thing
that
the
reviewing
court
can
do
is
look
at
the
return
which
is
filed
with
it
by
the
municipality.
that
return
would,
in
most
instances,
merely
contain
the
notes
from
the
clerk
of
the
municipality
which
would
state
under,
as
required
by
state
statute,
the
reasons
why
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
it
would,
it
contain
statement
of
reasons,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
would
submit
that
the
return
could
include
that
document,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
if
this
document
was
in
fact
adapted
by
the
city
council
as
its
reason
for
denying
the
license.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
possible
notes,
if
they
had
been
taken.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
would
submit
yes
under
state
law,
if
there
is
a
reason.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
by
state
statute.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
our
claim
here,
your
honor,
is
not
all
--
is
more
than
that.
we
are
claiming
that
the
procedures
were
arbitrary
because
prior
to
the
council’s
taking
the
action
that
they
did,
they
did
not
grant
each
of
the
appellees
a
hearing.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
that
is
the
other
aspect
of
arbitrariness
that
we
referred
to?
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
we
would
have
gone
to
state
court.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
you
cannot
have
a
liquor
license
unless
you
have
a
beer
license
first.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
in
each
instance,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
an
indication
in
the
record
as
to
whether
in
each
instance,
their
beer
license
is
worth
denial.
i
would
have
to
rely
on
the
representations
of
state
in
that
regard
that
they
were.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
that
is
the
argument
on
the
state,
your
honor,
but
i
would
submit
that
that
does
not
comport
with
a
reading
of
the
state
statute
which
provides
for
renewal
of
or
which
provides
for
procedures
on
beer
licenses,
section
66054
sub
14
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
page
4
of
the
brief
of
the
appellants.
that
provision
starting
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
4
mentions
that
the
action
of
any
city
council
in
granting
or
the
revocation
of
any
license
or
the
failure
of
said
city
council
to
revoke
any
license
for
good
cause
may
be
reviewed
by
any
court
of
record.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
our
point,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
no
express
declaration
in
this
statute
to
cover
the
situation
where
renewal
is
denied.
we
are
not
in
a
revocation
situation.
we
are
in
a
denial
of
renewal
situation
which
is
not
covered
by
the
stature.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
or
to
the
outraged
tavern
keeper
who
has
gone
to
revocation
procedures
which
are
separate
from
what
this
case
involves.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
it
did
not
consider,
if
my
recollection
of
the
lower
court
opinion
is
correct,
it
did
not
consider
that
remedy
is
a
viable
one
for
these
individuals.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
am
not
sure
what
the
opinion
on
the
point
states,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
then
the
question
would
be
if
they
did
get
a
remedy
in
state
court
and
they
did
get
a
beer
license,
then
the
next
problem
is
that
they
still
did
not
get
their
liquor
licenses
back
and
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
then
i
would
say
the
municipality
(voice
overlap)
states
would
have
to
provide
them
with
the
liquor
license,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
procedure
which
would
compel
them
to
do
it.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
not
in
the
way
that
we
have
just
gone
through
it.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
your
honor,
if
i
may,
the
situation
is
this
that
the
--
first
of
all,
we
submit
that
both
liberty
and
property
interests
under
the
definition
or
the
analysis
provided
in
board
of
regents
versus
roth,
both
concepts
of
liberty
and
property
were
involved
in
this
situation.
both
the
liberty
of
these
tavern
keepers
and
the
property
of
this
tavern
keepers
was
impaired
by
the
decisions
not
to
renew
their
liquor
licenses.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
it
is
similar
to
roth.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
there
are
some
very
significant
differences
from
the
roth
situations.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
now,
the
first
significant
difference
is
that
in
roth,
the
action
taken
with
regard
to
roth
was
not
--
the
reasons
for
not
renewing
roth’s
teaching
contract
were
never
stated,
were
not
required
to
be
stated,
were
never
made
public.
in
other
words,
roth
was
not
one
of
the
significant
factors
in
the
roth
case,
i
would
submit
is
that
roth
was
never
faced
with
a
situation
where
the
reasons
for
his
non
renewing
his
contract
or
communicated
to
anyone
and
if
those
reasons
had
been
one
reasons
which
alleged
dishonesty
on
his
part
or
immorality
in
his
affairs
and
they
had
been
communicated
to
public,
this
court
said
that
his
case
quite
clearly
would
have
been
a
different
way.
and
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
situation
is
very
analogous
in
our
own
case
in
that,
by
statute
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
but
that
is
not
the
central
point.
the
municipalities
did
not
say
that
they
were
denying
the
renewal
of
these
licenses
because
of
nude
dancing.
they
said
and
i
want
to
be
very
specific
first
of
all,
and
refer
it
to
the
appropriate
parts
of
the
record,
first
of
all,
the
municipality
of
racine,
you
will
know
it
on
pages
35
and
36
of
the
appendix,
there
are
the
reasons
which
the
municipality
of
racine
or
at
least
the
license
committee
gave
for
recommending
that
the
license
is
not
to
be
renewed.
now
that
--
those
statements
make
no
reference
whatsoever
to
nude
dancing.
they
do
attribute
to
the
tavern
keepers'
conduct
or
operations
which
foster
an
increase
in
prostitution
and
venereal
disease.
they
also
attribute
as
reason
f,
they
attribute
instances
of
serving
minors
on
the
premises.
they
attribute
matters
of
fights
or
altercations
and
violence
on
their
premises.
none
of
these
reasons
are
directly
related
or
in
any
way
stated
by
the
municipalities
to
involve
nude
dancing.
as
far
as
the
municipality
of
kenosha
is
concerned,
the
statement
of
reasons
in
that
situation
with
regard
to
the
six
kenosha
tavern
keepers
may
be
found
on
page
7
of
our
red
covered
brief.
and
again,
there
is
--
nowhere
in
this
record
is
there
simply
an
assertion
by
these
municipalities
that
they
are
not
renewing
these
licenses
merely
because
they
do
not
like
nude
dancing.
what
they
did
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
on
page
69
of
the
appendix,
your
honor?
mr.
james
a.
walrath
the
document
on
that
page
and
on
the
following
page;
both
of
those
documents
were
inserted
into
the
record
below
as
part
of
the
affidavits
on
motions
for
summary
judgments.
both
of
these
complaints
i
would
stress
relate
to
matters
which
occurred
long
after
or
after
any
of
these
license
renewal
denials
occurred.
in
other
words,
the
facts
that
are
stated
in
those
complaints
are
not
--
and
the
filing
of
those
complaints
are
not
relevant
to
the
reasons.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
think
they
were
inserted
as
part
of
the
documents
that
accompanied
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
state.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
there
is
definitely
something
in
this
record,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
the
question
is
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
record
before
the
licensing
committee
and
the
city
council
and
whether
they
said
specifically
or
only
that
the
only
reason
they
were
denying
these
licenses
is
because
of
nude
dancing.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
they
could
have
not
been,
your
honor,
because
they
were
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
did
not.
i
just
think
they
are
irrelevant.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
they
were
irrelevant
on
the
question
of
what
was
before
the
licensing
committee
and
the
city
council
at
the
time
it
reached
this
decision.
the
one
other
point
that
came
up
on
direct
argument
is
the
statement
of
reasons
why
the
kenosha
municipality,
why
it
denied
the
liquor
licenses,
those
reasons
that
you
find
on
page
7
of
our
brief
were
adapted
at
a
city
council
meeting
word
per
word.
in
other
words,
the
license
committee
entered
these
findings
and
then
made
these
findings
a
recommendation
to
the
city
council.
the
city
council
adapted
them,
word
for
word,
with
regard
to
each
of
the
six
applicants.
in
other
words,
word
for
word,
there
were
no
variations
in
finding
of
facts.
the
same
activities
were
ascribed
to
each
of
the
applicants
in
a
rather
indiscriminate
broad
fashion.
now
to
the
question
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
in
a
legislative
type
situation
where
you
are
as
in
larue
instance
where
you
are
dealing
with
legislative
findings
in
enacting
a
resolution
or
an
ordinance
or
state
statute,
these
kinds
of
statements
are
appropriate,
but
here
we
were
dealing
with
a
definite
adjudicatory
situation
where
the
city
council
or
the
licensing
committee
itself
was
passing
on
--
as
required
by
the
statute,
was
passing
on
the
question
of
whether
these
individuals
were
proper
individuals
to
have
their
licenses
renewed.
so,
i
think
we
are
in
an
adjudicatory
situation
which
requires
more
specific
findings
of
fact.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes
your
honor
and
that's
an
argument
that
we
did
not
make
sufficiently
i
would
submit
in
our
brief.
that
is
the
perry
versus
sindermann
rationale
that
--
i
would
submit
there
was
--
there
is
clear
evidence
that
there
is
an
implied
property
interest
in
--
or
claim
to
having
your
liquor
license
renewed
from
year-to-year.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
implied
by
the
very
fact
that
the
state
statutes
require
that
licenses
can
only
be
renewed,
if
reasons
are
--
are
not
renewed,
excuse
me,
can
only
be
denied
if
there
are
reasons
given
by
the
municipality.
secondly,
the
record
also
indicates
that
there
were
some
154
to
159,
i
believe,
applications
to
renew
licenses
before
the
municipality
and
in
only
six
situations,
the
six
appellees
in
this
case,
were
those
applications
denied.
so,
there
is
more
or
less
i
would
submit
a
common
law
situation
or
an
implied
situation
that
licenses
will
be
renewed
unless
the
cause
is
shown
by
the
municipality.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
the
three-judge
court
below
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
perry
versus
sindermann
or
roth
with
board
of
regents
versus
roth.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
but
we
think
quite
clearly
even
in
light
of
roth
which
does
restrict
concepts
or
at
least
define
concepts
of
liberty
and
property
more
carefully
that
quite
clearly,
these
individuals,
their
liberty
and
property
interests
were
affected.
going
back
to
the
definition
of
liberty
under
the
roth
decision,
i
would
submit
that
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
because
these
individuals
and
the
accusations
against
them
consisted
of
allegations
of
criminal
tight
conduct,
immoral
influence
on
minors
and
juveniles
in
the
community,
quite
clearly
this
brings
this
case
within
the
language
of
roth
that
these
are
the
types
of
allegations
which
affect
a
person’s
liberty.
and
more
importantly,
these
are
the
types
of
allegations
which
attribute
bad
moral
character
to
the
license
holders
and
by
state
statute
once
again,
a
critical
eligibility
factor
for
getting
a
license
is
that
you
must
be
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
i
would
submit
that
the
allegations
therefore,
are
in
effect,
makes
these
license
holders
ineligible
for
renewal
or
ineligible
to
hold
a
license
anywhere
else
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
because
they
have
been
branded
as
persons
of
bad
moral
character.
so,
that's
the
other
aspect
of
liberty
which
we
would
submit
has
been
affected.
just
because
these
tavern
keepers
who
run
legitimate
businesses
as
tavern
keepers
choose
to
have
burlesque
type
entertainment
or
topless
or
nude
dancing
on
their
premises
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
they,
in
any
way,
have
permitted
a
prostitution
on
their
premises
or
that
they
have
permitted
minors
on
their
premises
and
have
imposed
immoral
influences
on
juveniles.
and
these
were
the
allegations
that
were
labeled
against
them
and
these
are
the
allegations
which,
under
roth,
they
should
have
a
right
to
answer
and
counter.
now
i
hope
the
record
is
sufficiently
clear
under
what
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
beginning
of
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
the
former
and
not
the
latter.
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
dispute
or
challenge
these
allegations.
if
the
allegations
of
prostitution
or
immoral
influence
on
youths
had
been
established
at
the
hearing,
then
i
think
quite
clearly
it's
within
under
state
statute,
it's
within
the
power
of
the
municipalities
to
deny
their
applications.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
they
were
joined
because
the
lower
court
was
able
to
distinguish
the
monroe
versus
pape
language
in
that,
that
was,
if
i
recall
correctly,
a
request
for
damage
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
if
i
am
correct,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
was
in
the
context
of
a
damage
suit
against
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
it
is
our
position
that
it
can
be.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
there
are
two
cases
out
of
the
seven
circuit,
your
honor,
that
distinguishes
it
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
frankly,
i
am
not
familiar
enough
with
the
history
of
1983
to
be
able
to
distinguish
it
at
this
time.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
that
is
what
we
had.
we
had
two
cases.[laughter]
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
don't
dispute
that
except
for
the
fact
that
the
municipalities
in
this
case
didn't
say
that
they
were
denying
the
applications
because
of
that
fact
in
paragraph
26.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
the
statement
at
paragraph
32
was
something
that
happened
in
federal
court
and
it
is
a
statement
that
was
not
made
at
the
time
that
the
licenses
were
renewed
or
denied,
excuse
me,
that
the
renewal
applications
were
denied.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
think
the
purpose
of
paragraph
26
was
merely
to
get
an
agreed
stipulation
of
facts
that
in
fact
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
nude
dancing
occurred
on
these
premises.
that
is
not
a
disputed
fact.
what
is
disputed
is
whether
there
was
prostitution
on
the
premises.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well
at
the
time,
yes,
it
was
a
disputed
fact
because
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
whether
or
not
the
municipality
has
subsequently
been
proving
to
be
right
or
wrong
as
to
the
basis
for
denying
the
applications
still
does
not
counter
the
problem
that
these
individuals
and
the
procedures
that
confronted
them,
denied
them
due
process
initially.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
at
the
top
page
of
34?
mr.
james
a.
walrath
it
relied
but
it
did
not
specify
--
first
of
all,
it
did
not
give
any
notice
prior
to
going
into
any
of
these
meetings
or
hearings.
it
did
not
give
notice
that
that
was
what
the
charge
was
going
to
be.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
i
would
beg
to
differ
with
you,
your
honor.
this
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
it
says
that
the
defendant
city
relied
on
such
entertainment
as
one
of
the
factors
producing
the
effects
and
what
they
specifically
stated
was
the
reason
for
denying
the
license
--
the
applications
was
not
the
dance
entertainment,
it
was
the
allegations
of
paragraphs
a
through
f.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
what
you
are
reading
from
is
again
the
stipulation
of
facts.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that's
also
correct.
however,
the
stipulations
were
entered
in
every
case
which
is
noted
on
the
cover.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
there
is
no
crucial
variation
in
the
facts
as
far
as
what
were
stipulated
to.
the
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
so
long
as
we
have
a
hearing.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
we
are
not
challenging
what
happened
in
the
rule.
we
are
just
saying
before
you
can
deny
us
the
right
to
continue
our
taverns,
you
have
to
give
us
a
requisite
hearing
so
that
allegations
beyond
nude
dancing,
should
they
arise
and
should
they
be
the
basis
for
denying
the
licenses
can
be
countered,
if
they
are
in
fact
not
true.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
if
that
is
the
only
allegation
that
the
city
raises,
i
think
that
would
be
an
adequate
basis
for
non-renewal.
under
larue,
the
city
admittedly
does
have
an
ordinance
on
the
books
which
defines
what
type
of
dress
is
required
on
tavern
premises.
i
should
add,
however,
that
the
city
ordinance
is
not
identical
to
larue
statute
and
in
fact,
it
is
our
position
that
the
city
ordinance
is
even
broader
and
more
restrictive
than
larue
statute
so
that,
that
would
be
an
additional
issue
that
might
be
raised
at
a
hearing
before
the
city
council.
thank
you,
very
much.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
there
would
not
be.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
thank
you.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
some
of
the
points
that
have
risen
during
the
course
of
mr.
dalton’s
argument.
first
of
all,
the
argument
is
made
that
these
two
municipalities
have
been
enjoined
under
all
circumstances
from
denying
when
a
--
license
renewals
that
they
have
been
foreclosed
from
in
any
way
taking
these
licenses
away
from
the
individual
appellees
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
situation
and
i
would
refer
the
court
specifically
to
page
55
of
the
appendix
which
contains
a
statement
of
the
summary
judgment
order
of
the
district
court
which
indicates
that
the
municipalities
are
free
to
act
on
the
applications
at
such
time
that
their
actions
are
commensurate
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so,
the
municipalities
are
not
foreclosed
from
considering
these
applications
or
denying
them,
should
they
follow
the
procedures
which
were
outlined
by
the
three-judge
court
below.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
our
position
is,
your
honor,
that
they
could
not
and
that
was
the
next
point
i
want
to
raise.
the
procedures
which
must
be
followed
now,
i
have
specific
reference,
first
of
all,
to
when
a
liquor
license
as
opposed
to
a
beer
license
or
malt
beverage
license
is
not
renewed.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
would
submit
that
he
is
not
because
both
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
okay.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
liquor
licenses
are
concerned,
when
a
liquor
license
application
is
not
renewed,
the
remedy,
exclusive
remedy,
as
i
understand
it
under
wisconsin
law
is
by
certiorari
and
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
all
on
handwritten
notes
or
typed
notes
by
city
clerks,
whatever
is
there.
in
the
present
situation
there
was
very
little
of
any
sort
of
record
as
far
as
what
statements
were
made
at
the
hearings.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
there
definitely
is
no
entitlement
to
a
trial
de
novo,
excuse
me.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
on
certiorari,
the
only
thing
that
the
reviewing
court
can
do
is
look
at
the
return
which
is
filed
with
it
by
the
municipality.
that
return
would,
in
most
instances,
merely
contain
the
notes
from
the
clerk
of
the
municipality
which
would
state
under,
as
required
by
state
statute,
the
reasons
why
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
it
would,
it
contain
statement
of
reasons,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
would
submit
that
the
return
could
include
that
document,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
if
this
document
was
in
fact
adapted
by
the
city
council
as
its
reason
for
denying
the
license.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
possible
notes,
if
they
had
been
taken.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
would
submit
yes
under
state
law,
if
there
is
a
reason.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
by
state
statute.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
our
claim
here,
your
honor,
is
not
all
--
is
more
than
that.
we
are
claiming
that
the
procedures
were
arbitrary
because
prior
to
the
council’s
taking
the
action
that
they
did,
they
did
not
grant
each
of
the
appellees
a
hearing.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
that
is
the
other
aspect
of
arbitrariness
that
we
referred
to?
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
we
would
have
gone
to
state
court.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
you
cannot
have
a
liquor
license
unless
you
have
a
beer
license
first.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
in
each
instance,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
an
indication
in
the
record
as
to
whether
in
each
instance,
their
beer
license
is
worth
denial.
i
would
have
to
rely
on
the
representations
of
state
in
that
regard
that
they
were.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
that
is
the
argument
on
the
state,
your
honor,
but
i
would
submit
that
that
does
not
comport
with
a
reading
of
the
state
statute
which
provides
for
renewal
of
or
which
provides
for
procedures
on
beer
licenses,
section
66054
sub
14
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
page
4
of
the
brief
of
the
appellants.
that
provision
starting
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
4
mentions
that
the
action
of
any
city
council
in
granting
or
the
revocation
of
any
license
or
the
failure
of
said
city
council
to
revoke
any
license
for
good
cause
may
be
reviewed
by
any
court
of
record.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
our
point,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
no
express
declaration
in
this
statute
to
cover
the
situation
where
renewal
is
denied.
we
are
not
in
a
revocation
situation.
we
are
in
a
denial
of
renewal
situation
which
is
not
covered
by
the
stature.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
or
to
the
outraged
tavern
keeper
who
has
gone
to
revocation
procedures
which
are
separate
from
what
this
case
involves.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
it
did
not
consider,
if
my
recollection
of
the
lower
court
opinion
is
correct,
it
did
not
consider
that
remedy
is
a
viable
one
for
these
individuals.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
am
not
sure
what
the
opinion
on
the
point
states,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
then
the
question
would
be
if
they
did
get
a
remedy
in
state
court
and
they
did
get
a
beer
license,
then
the
next
problem
is
that
they
still
did
not
get
their
liquor
licenses
back
and
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
then
i
would
say
the
municipality
(voice
overlap)
states
would
have
to
provide
them
with
the
liquor
license,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
procedure
which
would
compel
them
to
do
it.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
not
in
the
way
that
we
have
just
gone
through
it.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
your
honor,
if
i
may,
the
situation
is
this
that
the
--
first
of
all,
we
submit
that
both
liberty
and
property
interests
under
the
definition
or
the
analysis
provided
in
board
of
regents
versus
roth,
both
concepts
of
liberty
and
property
were
involved
in
this
situation.
both
the
liberty
of
these
tavern
keepers
and
the
property
of
this
tavern
keepers
was
impaired
by
the
decisions
not
to
renew
their
liquor
licenses.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
it
is
similar
to
roth.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
there
are
some
very
significant
differences
from
the
roth
situations.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
now,
the
first
significant
difference
is
that
in
roth,
the
action
taken
with
regard
to
roth
was
not
--
the
reasons
for
not
renewing
roth’s
teaching
contract
were
never
stated,
were
not
required
to
be
stated,
were
never
made
public.
in
other
words,
roth
was
not
one
of
the
significant
factors
in
the
roth
case,
i
would
submit
is
that
roth
was
never
faced
with
a
situation
where
the
reasons
for
his
non
renewing
his
contract
or
communicated
to
anyone
and
if
those
reasons
had
been
one
reasons
which
alleged
dishonesty
on
his
part
or
immorality
in
his
affairs
and
they
had
been
communicated
to
public,
this
court
said
that
his
case
quite
clearly
would
have
been
a
different
way.
and
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
situation
is
very
analogous
in
our
own
case
in
that,
by
statute
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
but
that
is
not
the
central
point.
the
municipalities
did
not
say
that
they
were
denying
the
renewal
of
these
licenses
because
of
nude
dancing.
they
said
and
i
want
to
be
very
specific
first
of
all,
and
refer
it
to
the
appropriate
parts
of
the
record,
first
of
all,
the
municipality
of
racine,
you
will
know
it
on
pages
35
and
36
of
the
appendix,
there
are
the
reasons
which
the
municipality
of
racine
or
at
least
the
license
committee
gave
for
recommending
that
the
license
is
not
to
be
renewed.
now
that
--
those
statements
make
no
reference
whatsoever
to
nude
dancing.
they
do
attribute
to
the
tavern
keepers'
conduct
or
operations
which
foster
an
increase
in
prostitution
and
venereal
disease.
they
also
attribute
as
reason
f,
they
attribute
instances
of
serving
minors
on
the
premises.
they
attribute
matters
of
fights
or
altercations
and
violence
on
their
premises.
none
of
these
reasons
are
directly
related
or
in
any
way
stated
by
the
municipalities
to
involve
nude
dancing.
as
far
as
the
municipality
of
kenosha
is
concerned,
the
statement
of
reasons
in
that
situation
with
regard
to
the
six
kenosha
tavern
keepers
may
be
found
on
page
7
of
our
red
covered
brief.
and
again,
there
is
--
nowhere
in
this
record
is
there
simply
an
assertion
by
these
municipalities
that
they
are
not
renewing
these
licenses
merely
because
they
do
not
like
nude
dancing.
what
they
did
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
on
page
69
of
the
appendix,
your
honor?
mr.
james
a.
walrath
the
document
on
that
page
and
on
the
following
page;
both
of
those
documents
were
inserted
into
the
record
below
as
part
of
the
affidavits
on
motions
for
summary
judgments.
both
of
these
complaints
i
would
stress
relate
to
matters
which
occurred
long
after
or
after
any
of
these
license
renewal
denials
occurred.
in
other
words,
the
facts
that
are
stated
in
those
complaints
are
not
--
and
the
filing
of
those
complaints
are
not
relevant
to
the
reasons.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
think
they
were
inserted
as
part
of
the
documents
that
accompanied
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
state.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
there
is
definitely
something
in
this
record,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
the
question
is
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
record
before
the
licensing
committee
and
the
city
council
and
whether
they
said
specifically
or
only
that
the
only
reason
they
were
denying
these
licenses
is
because
of
nude
dancing.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
they
could
have
not
been,
your
honor,
because
they
were
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
did
not.
i
just
think
they
are
irrelevant.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
they
were
irrelevant
on
the
question
of
what
was
before
the
licensing
committee
and
the
city
council
at
the
time
it
reached
this
decision.
the
one
other
point
that
came
up
on
direct
argument
is
the
statement
of
reasons
why
the
kenosha
municipality,
why
it
denied
the
liquor
licenses,
those
reasons
that
you
find
on
page
7
of
our
brief
were
adapted
at
a
city
council
meeting
word
per
word.
in
other
words,
the
license
committee
entered
these
findings
and
then
made
these
findings
a
recommendation
to
the
city
council.
the
city
council
adapted
them,
word
for
word,
with
regard
to
each
of
the
six
applicants.
in
other
words,
word
for
word,
there
were
no
variations
in
finding
of
facts.
the
same
activities
were
ascribed
to
each
of
the
applicants
in
a
rather
indiscriminate
broad
fashion.
now
to
the
question
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
in
a
legislative
type
situation
where
you
are
as
in
larue
instance
where
you
are
dealing
with
legislative
findings
in
enacting
a
resolution
or
an
ordinance
or
state
statute,
these
kinds
of
statements
are
appropriate,
but
here
we
were
dealing
with
a
definite
adjudicatory
situation
where
the
city
council
or
the
licensing
committee
itself
was
passing
on
--
as
required
by
the
statute,
was
passing
on
the
question
of
whether
these
individuals
were
proper
individuals
to
have
their
licenses
renewed.
so,
i
think
we
are
in
an
adjudicatory
situation
which
requires
more
specific
findings
of
fact.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes
your
honor
and
that's
an
argument
that
we
did
not
make
sufficiently
i
would
submit
in
our
brief.
that
is
the
perry
versus
sindermann
rationale
that
--
i
would
submit
there
was
--
there
is
clear
evidence
that
there
is
an
implied
property
interest
in
--
or
claim
to
having
your
liquor
license
renewed
from
year-to-year.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
implied
by
the
very
fact
that
the
state
statutes
require
that
licenses
can
only
be
renewed,
if
reasons
are
--
are
not
renewed,
excuse
me,
can
only
be
denied
if
there
are
reasons
given
by
the
municipality.
secondly,
the
record
also
indicates
that
there
were
some
154
to
159,
i
believe,
applications
to
renew
licenses
before
the
municipality
and
in
only
six
situations,
the
six
appellees
in
this
case,
were
those
applications
denied.
so,
there
is
more
or
less
i
would
submit
a
common
law
situation
or
an
implied
situation
that
licenses
will
be
renewed
unless
the
cause
is
shown
by
the
municipality.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
the
three-judge
court
below
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
perry
versus
sindermann
or
roth
with
board
of
regents
versus
roth.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
but
we
think
quite
clearly
even
in
light
of
roth
which
does
restrict
concepts
or
at
least
define
concepts
of
liberty
and
property
more
carefully
that
quite
clearly,
these
individuals,
their
liberty
and
property
interests
were
affected.
going
back
to
the
definition
of
liberty
under
the
roth
decision,
i
would
submit
that
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
because
these
individuals
and
the
accusations
against
them
consisted
of
allegations
of
criminal
tight
conduct,
immoral
influence
on
minors
and
juveniles
in
the
community,
quite
clearly
this
brings
this
case
within
the
language
of
roth
that
these
are
the
types
of
allegations
which
affect
a
person’s
liberty.
and
more
importantly,
these
are
the
types
of
allegations
which
attribute
bad
moral
character
to
the
license
holders
and
by
state
statute
once
again,
a
critical
eligibility
factor
for
getting
a
license
is
that
you
must
be
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
i
would
submit
that
the
allegations
therefore,
are
in
effect,
makes
these
license
holders
ineligible
for
renewal
or
ineligible
to
hold
a
license
anywhere
else
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
because
they
have
been
branded
as
persons
of
bad
moral
character.
so,
that's
the
other
aspect
of
liberty
which
we
would
submit
has
been
affected.
just
because
these
tavern
keepers
who
run
legitimate
businesses
as
tavern
keepers
choose
to
have
burlesque
type
entertainment
or
topless
or
nude
dancing
on
their
premises
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
they,
in
any
way,
have
permitted
a
prostitution
on
their
premises
or
that
they
have
permitted
minors
on
their
premises
and
have
imposed
immoral
influences
on
juveniles.
and
these
were
the
allegations
that
were
labeled
against
them
and
these
are
the
allegations
which,
under
roth,
they
should
have
a
right
to
answer
and
counter.
now
i
hope
the
record
is
sufficiently
clear
under
what
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
beginning
of
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
the
former
and
not
the
latter.
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
dispute
or
challenge
these
allegations.
if
the
allegations
of
prostitution
or
immoral
influence
on
youths
had
been
established
at
the
hearing,
then
i
think
quite
clearly
it's
within
under
state
statute,
it's
within
the
power
of
the
municipalities
to
deny
their
applications.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
they
were
joined
because
the
lower
court
was
able
to
distinguish
the
monroe
versus
pape
language
in
that,
that
was,
if
i
recall
correctly,
a
request
for
damage
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
but
if
i
am
correct,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
was
in
the
context
of
a
damage
suit
against
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
it
is
our
position
that
it
can
be.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
there
are
two
cases
out
of
the
seven
circuit,
your
honor,
that
distinguishes
it
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
frankly,
i
am
not
familiar
enough
with
the
history
of
1983
to
be
able
to
distinguish
it
at
this
time.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
that
is
what
we
had.
we
had
two
cases.[laughter]
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
don't
dispute
that
except
for
the
fact
that
the
municipalities
in
this
case
didn't
say
that
they
were
denying
the
applications
because
of
that
fact
in
paragraph
26.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
the
statement
at
paragraph
32
was
something
that
happened
in
federal
court
and
it
is
a
statement
that
was
not
made
at
the
time
that
the
licenses
were
renewed
or
denied,
excuse
me,
that
the
renewal
applications
were
denied.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
i
think
the
purpose
of
paragraph
26
was
merely
to
get
an
agreed
stipulation
of
facts
that
in
fact
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
nude
dancing
occurred
on
these
premises.
that
is
not
a
disputed
fact.
what
is
disputed
is
whether
there
was
prostitution
on
the
premises.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well
at
the
time,
yes,
it
was
a
disputed
fact
because
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
whether
or
not
the
municipality
has
subsequently
been
proving
to
be
right
or
wrong
as
to
the
basis
for
denying
the
applications
still
does
not
counter
the
problem
that
these
individuals
and
the
procedures
that
confronted
them,
denied
them
due
process
initially.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
at
the
top
page
of
34?
mr.
james
a.
walrath
it
relied
but
it
did
not
specify
--
first
of
all,
it
did
not
give
any
notice
prior
to
going
into
any
of
these
meetings
or
hearings.
it
did
not
give
notice
that
that
was
what
the
charge
was
going
to
be.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
i
would
beg
to
differ
with
you,
your
honor.
this
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
it
says
that
the
defendant
city
relied
on
such
entertainment
as
one
of
the
factors
producing
the
effects
and
what
they
specifically
stated
was
the
reason
for
denying
the
license
--
the
applications
was
not
the
dance
entertainment,
it
was
the
allegations
of
paragraphs
a
through
f.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
well,
what
you
are
reading
from
is
again
the
stipulation
of
facts.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
that's
also
correct.
however,
the
stipulations
were
entered
in
every
case
which
is
noted
on
the
cover.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
there
is
no
crucial
variation
in
the
facts
as
far
as
what
were
stipulated
to.
the
--
mr.
james
a.
walrath
yes.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
so
long
as
we
have
a
hearing.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
we
are
not
challenging
what
happened
in
the
rule.
we
are
just
saying
before
you
can
deny
us
the
right
to
continue
our
taverns,
you
have
to
give
us
a
requisite
hearing
so
that
allegations
beyond
nude
dancing,
should
they
arise
and
should
they
be
the
basis
for
denying
the
licenses
can
be
countered,
if
they
are
in
fact
not
true.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
if
that
is
the
only
allegation
that
the
city
raises,
i
think
that
would
be
an
adequate
basis
for
non-renewal.
under
larue,
the
city
admittedly
does
have
an
ordinance
on
the
books
which
defines
what
type
of
dress
is
required
on
tavern
premises.
i
should
add,
however,
that
the
city
ordinance
is
not
identical
to
larue
statute
and
in
fact,
it
is
our
position
that
the
city
ordinance
is
even
broader
and
more
restrictive
than
larue
statute
so
that,
that
would
be
an
additional
issue
that
might
be
raised
at
a
hearing
before
the
city
council.
thank
you,
very
much.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
no,
there
would
not
be.
mr.
james
a.
walrath
thank
you.
