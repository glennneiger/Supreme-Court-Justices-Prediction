mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
this
case
involves
the
liquor
licenses
of
three
bars
in
the
city
of
racine
and
six
bars
in
the
city
of
kenosha.
kenosha
is
a
city
of
about
70,000
or
more
on
the
border
of
wisconsin
and
illinois,
just
north
of
chicago.
racine
is
the
city
of
about
90,000
to
95,000
just
a
few
miles
north
of
kenosha.
this
appeal
is
from
a
judgment
holding
that
wisconsin’s
statutes
which
permit
legislative
hearings
in
liquor
license
renewals
and
original
granting
are
in
violation
of
a
due
process
clause.
the
court
said
that
insofar
as
those
statutes
permit
the
denial
of
the
renewal
of
licenses,
granting
of
licenses
without
a
judicial
type
hearing,
the
statutes
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
judgment
is
so
broad
against
these
two
cities
that
when
the
licensing
year
which
is
approaching
arrives,
these
cities
are
enjoined
from
denying
any
renewals.
a
motion
is
pending
before
the
three-judge
court
to
modify
that,
but
is
un-acted
upon.
i
would
like
to
take
the
court
back
through
our
liquor
licensing
regulations
in
wisconsin.
we
have
what
may
be
compared
to
the
old
town
meeting
type
of
legislation.
since
the
twenty-first
amendment,
we
permit
what
we
call
local
option.
that
means
that
each
of
the
over
7,000
local
municipalities
in
wisconsin
have
the
authority
to
grant
or
not
to
grant
licenses
for
the
sale
of
beer
or
intoxicating
liquor
or
both.
this
is
a
legislative
grant
to
these
municipalities
and
at
the
present
time
about
a
150
municipalities
do
not
permit
the
total
package.
there
are
some
that
permit
beer,
of
course,
the
majority
permit
beer
and
liquor
but
there
are
some
that
permit
neither.
now,
these
cities,
towns
and
villages
are
the
ultimate
authority
in
our
state
to
determine
whether
or
not
beer
and
intoxicating
liquor
would
be
served
within
their
borders.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
either
the
voters
or
the
governing
body.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
governing
body
can
refuse
to
issue
any
licenses
under
our
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
there
can
be
referendum
here
initiated
by
the
voters
to
put
the
issue
up
to
election
as
to
whether
or
not
there
shall
be.
if
there
is
say
it
can
be
taken
away,
if
there
is
not
by
referendum
it
can
be
granted
by
the
voters,
but
then
it
is
up
to
the
–-
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
then
it's
up
to
the
governing
body
each
year
to
decide
which
licenses
will
be
issued.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
this
is
under
other
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
our
statute
provides
that
the
license
runs
for
one
year
from
july
1st
to
the
succeeding
june
30th.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
can
be
revoked,
but
then
there
has
to
be
what
amounts
to
an
adjudicatory-type
hearing.
there
is
a
special
statute
applying
to
revocation
of
the
license
or
suspending
of
it
during
the
period
of
its
life.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
licensing
body.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
is
by
certiorari.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
we
just
went
through
one
of
those
in
the
town
of
madison,
what
surrounds
the
city
of
madison
where
we
had
another
nude
bar
and
before
they
could
get
away,
by
going
to
the
state
court
for
certiorari,
they
went
into
the
federal
court,
and
the
federal
court
enjoined
the
town
from
revoking.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor.
these
annual
licenses
must
be
applied
for
by
april
15
each
year.
the
statute
sets
out
a
procedure
that
each
of
the
municipalities
must
follow
as
to
time.
they
must
begin
to
act
on
the
licenses,
may
15
and
they
must
make
final
determinations
by
june
15.
this
gives
a
leeway
of
at
least
two
weeks
between
the
time
of
the
final
determination
by
the
municipality,
and
the
succeeding
licensing
year.
during
this
period
of
time,
the
aggrieved
parties
of
course,
can
avail
themselves
of
one
of
two
court
proceedings
in
the
state.
now,
no
liquor
license
can
be
issued
in
wisconsin
unless
the
applicant
has
first
obtained
a
beer
license.
the
beer
license
if
it
is
denied,
if
the
application
is
denied,
can
be
reviewed
by
a
procedure
in
any
court
of
record
in
the
county.
this
is
an
original
action
brought
by
the
applicant
to
test
the
revocation
or
denial
of
a
license
in
the
county
court
or
circuit
court.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
trail
de
novo.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no
it's
a
trial
de
novo
and
there
are
limits
set
by
the
wisconsin's
statute
as
to
when
the
court
must
act
so
that
any
aggrieved
parties
can
have
a
prompt
determination
of
the
issues.
the
other
type
of
court
review
is
by
certiorari
and
i
think
the
court
has
without
any
question
set
out
the
procedures
that
are
to
be
followed
in
that
type
of
proceedings.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
discretionary.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that's
in
the
circuit
court,
that
is
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
within
the
state.
now,
there
is
another
feature
in
wisconsin
law.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that's
a
review
including
all
constitutional
questions.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
there
are
the
notes
that
are
made
in
court
in
review.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
is
no
transcript
of
testimony,
no
verbatim
transcript,
but
if
there
is
a
denial,
of
course,
the
statute
requires
a
statement
of
the
reasons
for
denial
be
made
in
the
record
and
all
of
the
notes
of
the
licensing
body
in
the
case
of
the
city
council
that
are
subsequently
printed
and
they
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
would
go
to
the
circuit
court
for
review.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
reasons
should
be
stated
according
to
our
statute
whenever
renewal
is
refused,
renewal.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
not
for
original
application.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes
and
our
supreme
court
has
indicated
that,
that
is
to
facilitate
the
certiorari
so
that
the
court
can
determine
whether
or
not
any
action
taken
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
he
would
find
out
at
the
time.
these
are
all
public
hearings
and
public
meetings.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
may
yes
they
are
public
records.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
they
would
be,
i
imagine
would
be
available.
i
am
not
sure
how
fast
these
are
printed,
but
there
would
be
some
record
in
the
clerk’s
office.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that's
after
the
city
council
has
acted.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
files
an
application
each
year.
he
files
an
application
with
the
city
council
and
by
our
law
he
must
pay
for
having
that
printed
in
the
local
paper.
the
burden
is
always
on
the
applicant
to
carry
forward
his
request
to
the
governing
body
to
license
him
for
a
one-year
period.
on
renewal
it's
the
same
as
the
original
but
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
this
is
a
difficult
term.
hearing
is
i
think
it
depends
on
what
situation
you
are
in.
now,
we
have
run
up
repeatedly
in
the
federal
court
system
where
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
a
notice
of
what,
your
honor?
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
understands,
each
year
when
he
applies
that
there
will
be
hearings
on
all
licenses
that
have
been
filed,
that
the
applications
have
been
filed
for
on
15th
of
april.
he
knows,
he
should
know
that
each
one
of
these
boards
and
committees
will
have
to
act
upon
these
licenses
between
may
15
and
june
15.
the
notice,
i
think
what
you
are
talking
about
is
when
the
licensing
body
is
going
to
hear
these
requests
for
license.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
all
of
them.
they
usually
set
license
matters
for
hearing
on
a
certain
date
and
there
are
requirements
that
--
within
the
city
law
that
they
hold
license
hearings
on
specific
dates
and
that
notice
is
posted
on
the
city
council
bulletin
board
and
it
is
printed
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
not
necessarily.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
is
very
possible.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
they
testify,
yes
if
they
want
to.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
unless
he
asks
and
makes
a
motion.
the
city
council
is
an
administrative
body.
it
acts
in
a
legislative
capacity.
it
acts
on
quasi-judicial
capacity.
sometimes
it
acts
in
administrative
capacity.
it
has
the
power
to
do
many
things,
but
the
liquor
licensing
function
is
not
what
we
consider
to
be
a
contested
matter.
the
man
comes
in
and
applies
and
he
has
the
burden
of
convincing
the
licensing
body
that
he
should
have
a
license
for
the
succeeding
year.
now,
he
has
the
burden
from
the
beginning
of
convincing
that
legislative
body
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
at
that
point,
the
city
council
is
not
sitting
as
a
quasi-judicial
body.
it's
sitting
as
a
legislative
body.
it
has
been
delegated
the
authority
by
the
state
legislative
body,
the
state
legislature.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
only
one
practice,
your
honor
is
the
hearing
that's
granted
is
legislative
type
hearing.
the
same
as
would
be
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
if
he
asks
for
it,
but
i
am
not
ruling
out
that
if
he
asks
for
a
fact-finding
hearing
before
the
board
that
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
it.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
is
no
provision
in
the
law,
but
the
city
council
may
sit
as
a
fact-finding
body.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
they
have
held
that
a
legislative
hearing
comports
with
due
process.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
right
but
if
there
is
an
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes
in
the
county
court.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
depends
upon
the
court
order.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
can
convince
the
court
that
he
should
continue
during
the
litigation,
the
court
could,
the
same
as
the
lower
did
here,
grant
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
are
nine
of
these
and
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
i
understand
that
three
of
them
are
on
a
business
but
they
have
been
protected
by
the
federal
court
for
almost
two-and-a-half
years
by
different
orders
allowing
them
to
continue
nude
dancing
and
the
selling
of
alcohol.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
when
he
starts
his
court
action,
he
must
make
allegations
that
he
has
some
legal
right
that's
being
violated.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
and
one
of
those
i
was
suggesting
is
that
the
licensing
body
has
come
to
a
wrong
conclusion
as
to
some
facts.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
so,
he
could
have
a
factual
determination
by
the
court
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
and
then
that
could
be
applied
to
the
denial
of
the
renewal
and
his
legal
rights
would
be
protected.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
if
you
are
talking
about
the
66.054,
our
supreme
court
has
not
yet
interpreted
the
breadth
of
that
provision.
apparently,
no
one
has
ever
really
carried
a
case
under
that
statute
all
the
way
through.
they
usually
use
the
certiorari
provision
and
there
our
supreme
court
has
said
that
they
are
limited
to
a
review
of
arbitrary,
capricious
action.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
whatever
notes
are
in
the
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
was
the
report
of
this
committee.
the
committee
reports
to
the
council
and
then
the
council
acts
based
upon
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no
it
is
not
de
novo
on
certiorari.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
i
think
certiorari
is
discretionary
writ
which
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
am
sorry,
i
misled
you.
section
66.054
applies
to
the
beer
license.
you
can't
have
a
liquor
license
unless
you
first
have
a
beer
license.
now,
this
statute
which
has
not
been
really
interpreted
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
as
to
its
breadth
says
that
if
the
council
revokes
or
does
not
grant
a
license
for
good
cause
then
a
regular
court
proceeding
may
be
held
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
good
cause.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
a
de
novo
trial.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that's
the
applicants
choice
as
to
whether
he
wants
to
move
by
this
route
or
by
a
certiorari.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
if
he
has
factual,
excuse
me,
if
he
has
factual
issues
which
he
wishes
to
be
determined,
let's
take
for
instance
in
this
case.
let's
say
that
an
applicant
said,
well,
you
told
me
that
i
was
permitting
nude
dancing
and
you
wouldn't
renew
my
license
because
of
that
and
i
wasn't
permitting
nude
dancing
and
he
wants
a
factual
determination
of
that.
now
i
suggest
that
he
can
either
ask
the
council
and
this
basically
is
not
required
under
the
statute,
nor
supreme
court
said
it
was
necessary,
but
i
am
saying
that
he
could
ask
the
council
for
a
hearing
on
that
point
and
could
ask
to
bring
in
his
own
court
reporters
and
to
have
testimony
taken.
the
council
is
perfectly
capable
under
rules
of
administrative
law
of
setting
its
all
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
then
he
may
choose
one
of
these
two
judicial
routes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
right.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
is
one
exception,
the
certiorari
court
could
weigh
evidence
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
substantial
evidence.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
they
could
refer
it
back
to
the
administrative
body.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
is
on
page
four
of
our
brief
section
66(054).
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
action
of
any
city
council,
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
that's
only
on
the
beer
license
which
is
a
necessary
step
to
get
a
liquor
license?
i
guess
we
qualify
first
for
beer
license
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
both
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yeah.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
then
it's
tested
by
arbitrary
capricious
act.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
statement
of
reasons
were
just
referred
to
by
justice
brennan.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
was
the
committee
report.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
the
statement
of
reason
that
was
adapted
by
the
council
was
because
these
bars
had
nude
dancing.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
is
in
the
--
these
were
stipulations
of
facts
that
were
entered.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
on
page
28
of
the
appendix.
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
relate
to
all
of
the
issues
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor,
on
page
32
number
26,
that
such
statutes
perform
both
in
customs
and
in
the
news.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
other
than
the
report
of
the
committee.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
they
adapted
the
committee
report.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
the
council
as
a
whole
made
the
final
determination.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
these
cases
they
were
all
referred
to
the
city
council.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
they
were
in
fact
referred
to
city
council
and
they
adapted
the
reports
of
the
committee.
now,
the
committee
reports
are
in
fact
the
basis
for
the
legislative
action.
the
reasons
why
the
legislative
body
decided
that
they
would
resolve
not
to
have
nude
dancing
within
their
municipality.
now,
it's
true
that
this
record
is
not
specifically
set
out
that
resolution.
and
i
think
that,
that
is
a
not
a
federal
constitutional
question.
that's
a
question
of
state
law
as
to
whether
or
not
the
city
council
in
these
cases
actually
followed
the
state
law
when
they
adapted
the
resolution
that
they
would
not
license
nude
bars
within
their
communities.
now,
to
give
you
a
little
more
background
on
what
happened,
the
two
cities
when
faced
during
the
1970
license
year
with
nude
dancing
in
several
bars
and
after
receiving
over
two
thousand
petitions
in
the
city
of
kenosha
and
upward
of
25,000
in
the
city
of
racine,
the
councils
in
both
cities
passed
ordinances
which
regulated
costumes
in
cabarets.
this
required
the
dancers
to
cover
the
sexual
organs.
both
cities
were
enjoined
by
the
federal
district
court
in
december
of
1970.
from
that
point
until
the
next
licensing
year
in
1971,
the
city
which
--
both
these
cities
were
faced
with
a
dilemma
of
how
to
control
nude
dancing
in
the
bars
in
those
cities.
the
test
of
obscenity
was
difficult.
the
county
prosecutor
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
the
rule
we
think
solves
that
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
after
the
rule,
the
district
court
released
the
injunctions
that
had
permitted
the
nude
dancing
to
take
place
in
these
two
cities,
but
while
this
injunction
was
in
effect,
the
city
decided
that
they
would
not
re-license
these
bars
and
they
sat
as
a
legislative
body
in
doing
this.
they
did
not
sit
and
adjudicate
each
one
of
these
cases.
they
decided
that
they
would
not
permit
nude
dancing
in
their
cities
and
each
one
of
these
bars
in
each
city,
the
bars
were
treated
as
a
group
and
they
made
a
policy
statement
and
i
agree
that
the
committee
report
here
probably
does
not
satisfy
the
wisconsin
statute
in
regard
to
the
reasons
why
the
denials
were
made,
but
that
is
not
a
federal
constitutional
question.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
maybe
the
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
my
point
is
these
are
the
underlying
reasons
for
the
legislative
resolution.
the
legislative
resolution
is
why
these
licenses
were
denied.
they
all
were
featuring
nude
dancing.
both
these
communities
that
decided
that
they
would
not
permit
nude
dancing
anymore
and
the
reasons
why
they
would
not
permit
nude
dancing
were
the
item
set
out
in
the
committee
report.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
our
supreme
court
has
so
held.
we
have
the
power
to
do
away
with
all
bars.
each
municipality
can
decide
one
year
or
the
next.
they
can
wipe
out
every
bar
within
the
municipality
by
proper
legislative
action.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
sir.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
this
case
involves
the
liquor
licenses
of
three
bars
in
the
city
of
racine
and
six
bars
in
the
city
of
kenosha.
kenosha
is
a
city
of
about
70,000
or
more
on
the
border
of
wisconsin
and
illinois,
just
north
of
chicago.
racine
is
the
city
of
about
90,000
to
95,000
just
a
few
miles
north
of
kenosha.
this
appeal
is
from
a
judgment
holding
that
wisconsin’s
statutes
which
permit
legislative
hearings
in
liquor
license
renewals
and
original
granting
are
in
violation
of
a
due
process
clause.
the
court
said
that
insofar
as
those
statutes
permit
the
denial
of
the
renewal
of
licenses,
granting
of
licenses
without
a
judicial
type
hearing,
the
statutes
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
judgment
is
so
broad
against
these
two
cities
that
when
the
licensing
year
which
is
approaching
arrives,
these
cities
are
enjoined
from
denying
any
renewals.
a
motion
is
pending
before
the
three-judge
court
to
modify
that,
but
is
un-acted
upon.
i
would
like
to
take
the
court
back
through
our
liquor
licensing
regulations
in
wisconsin.
we
have
what
may
be
compared
to
the
old
town
meeting
type
of
legislation.
since
the
twenty-first
amendment,
we
permit
what
we
call
local
option.
that
means
that
each
of
the
over
7,000
local
municipalities
in
wisconsin
have
the
authority
to
grant
or
not
to
grant
licenses
for
the
sale
of
beer
or
intoxicating
liquor
or
both.
this
is
a
legislative
grant
to
these
municipalities
and
at
the
present
time
about
a
150
municipalities
do
not
permit
the
total
package.
there
are
some
that
permit
beer,
of
course,
the
majority
permit
beer
and
liquor
but
there
are
some
that
permit
neither.
now,
these
cities,
towns
and
villages
are
the
ultimate
authority
in
our
state
to
determine
whether
or
not
beer
and
intoxicating
liquor
would
be
served
within
their
borders.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
either
the
voters
or
the
governing
body.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
governing
body
can
refuse
to
issue
any
licenses
under
our
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
there
can
be
referendum
here
initiated
by
the
voters
to
put
the
issue
up
to
election
as
to
whether
or
not
there
shall
be.
if
there
is
say
it
can
be
taken
away,
if
there
is
not
by
referendum
it
can
be
granted
by
the
voters,
but
then
it
is
up
to
the
–-
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
then
it's
up
to
the
governing
body
each
year
to
decide
which
licenses
will
be
issued.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
this
is
under
other
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
our
statute
provides
that
the
license
runs
for
one
year
from
july
1st
to
the
succeeding
june
30th.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
can
be
revoked,
but
then
there
has
to
be
what
amounts
to
an
adjudicatory-type
hearing.
there
is
a
special
statute
applying
to
revocation
of
the
license
or
suspending
of
it
during
the
period
of
its
life.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
licensing
body.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
is
by
certiorari.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
we
just
went
through
one
of
those
in
the
town
of
madison,
what
surrounds
the
city
of
madison
where
we
had
another
nude
bar
and
before
they
could
get
away,
by
going
to
the
state
court
for
certiorari,
they
went
into
the
federal
court,
and
the
federal
court
enjoined
the
town
from
revoking.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor.
these
annual
licenses
must
be
applied
for
by
april
15
each
year.
the
statute
sets
out
a
procedure
that
each
of
the
municipalities
must
follow
as
to
time.
they
must
begin
to
act
on
the
licenses,
may
15
and
they
must
make
final
determinations
by
june
15.
this
gives
a
leeway
of
at
least
two
weeks
between
the
time
of
the
final
determination
by
the
municipality,
and
the
succeeding
licensing
year.
during
this
period
of
time,
the
aggrieved
parties
of
course,
can
avail
themselves
of
one
of
two
court
proceedings
in
the
state.
now,
no
liquor
license
can
be
issued
in
wisconsin
unless
the
applicant
has
first
obtained
a
beer
license.
the
beer
license
if
it
is
denied,
if
the
application
is
denied,
can
be
reviewed
by
a
procedure
in
any
court
of
record
in
the
county.
this
is
an
original
action
brought
by
the
applicant
to
test
the
revocation
or
denial
of
a
license
in
the
county
court
or
circuit
court.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
trail
de
novo.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no
it's
a
trial
de
novo
and
there
are
limits
set
by
the
wisconsin's
statute
as
to
when
the
court
must
act
so
that
any
aggrieved
parties
can
have
a
prompt
determination
of
the
issues.
the
other
type
of
court
review
is
by
certiorari
and
i
think
the
court
has
without
any
question
set
out
the
procedures
that
are
to
be
followed
in
that
type
of
proceedings.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
discretionary.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that's
in
the
circuit
court,
that
is
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
within
the
state.
now,
there
is
another
feature
in
wisconsin
law.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that's
a
review
including
all
constitutional
questions.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
there
are
the
notes
that
are
made
in
court
in
review.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
is
no
transcript
of
testimony,
no
verbatim
transcript,
but
if
there
is
a
denial,
of
course,
the
statute
requires
a
statement
of
the
reasons
for
denial
be
made
in
the
record
and
all
of
the
notes
of
the
licensing
body
in
the
case
of
the
city
council
that
are
subsequently
printed
and
they
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
would
go
to
the
circuit
court
for
review.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
reasons
should
be
stated
according
to
our
statute
whenever
renewal
is
refused,
renewal.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
not
for
original
application.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes
and
our
supreme
court
has
indicated
that,
that
is
to
facilitate
the
certiorari
so
that
the
court
can
determine
whether
or
not
any
action
taken
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
he
would
find
out
at
the
time.
these
are
all
public
hearings
and
public
meetings.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
may
yes
they
are
public
records.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
they
would
be,
i
imagine
would
be
available.
i
am
not
sure
how
fast
these
are
printed,
but
there
would
be
some
record
in
the
clerk’s
office.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that's
after
the
city
council
has
acted.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
files
an
application
each
year.
he
files
an
application
with
the
city
council
and
by
our
law
he
must
pay
for
having
that
printed
in
the
local
paper.
the
burden
is
always
on
the
applicant
to
carry
forward
his
request
to
the
governing
body
to
license
him
for
a
one-year
period.
on
renewal
it's
the
same
as
the
original
but
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
this
is
a
difficult
term.
hearing
is
i
think
it
depends
on
what
situation
you
are
in.
now,
we
have
run
up
repeatedly
in
the
federal
court
system
where
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
a
notice
of
what,
your
honor?
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
understands,
each
year
when
he
applies
that
there
will
be
hearings
on
all
licenses
that
have
been
filed,
that
the
applications
have
been
filed
for
on
15th
of
april.
he
knows,
he
should
know
that
each
one
of
these
boards
and
committees
will
have
to
act
upon
these
licenses
between
may
15
and
june
15.
the
notice,
i
think
what
you
are
talking
about
is
when
the
licensing
body
is
going
to
hear
these
requests
for
license.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
all
of
them.
they
usually
set
license
matters
for
hearing
on
a
certain
date
and
there
are
requirements
that
--
within
the
city
law
that
they
hold
license
hearings
on
specific
dates
and
that
notice
is
posted
on
the
city
council
bulletin
board
and
it
is
printed
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
not
necessarily.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
is
very
possible.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
they
testify,
yes
if
they
want
to.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
unless
he
asks
and
makes
a
motion.
the
city
council
is
an
administrative
body.
it
acts
in
a
legislative
capacity.
it
acts
on
quasi-judicial
capacity.
sometimes
it
acts
in
administrative
capacity.
it
has
the
power
to
do
many
things,
but
the
liquor
licensing
function
is
not
what
we
consider
to
be
a
contested
matter.
the
man
comes
in
and
applies
and
he
has
the
burden
of
convincing
the
licensing
body
that
he
should
have
a
license
for
the
succeeding
year.
now,
he
has
the
burden
from
the
beginning
of
convincing
that
legislative
body
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
at
that
point,
the
city
council
is
not
sitting
as
a
quasi-judicial
body.
it's
sitting
as
a
legislative
body.
it
has
been
delegated
the
authority
by
the
state
legislative
body,
the
state
legislature.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
only
one
practice,
your
honor
is
the
hearing
that's
granted
is
legislative
type
hearing.
the
same
as
would
be
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
if
he
asks
for
it,
but
i
am
not
ruling
out
that
if
he
asks
for
a
fact-finding
hearing
before
the
board
that
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
it.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
is
no
provision
in
the
law,
but
the
city
council
may
sit
as
a
fact-finding
body.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
they
have
held
that
a
legislative
hearing
comports
with
due
process.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
right
but
if
there
is
an
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes
in
the
county
court.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
depends
upon
the
court
order.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
he
can
convince
the
court
that
he
should
continue
during
the
litigation,
the
court
could,
the
same
as
the
lower
did
here,
grant
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
are
nine
of
these
and
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
i
understand
that
three
of
them
are
on
a
business
but
they
have
been
protected
by
the
federal
court
for
almost
two-and-a-half
years
by
different
orders
allowing
them
to
continue
nude
dancing
and
the
selling
of
alcohol.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
when
he
starts
his
court
action,
he
must
make
allegations
that
he
has
some
legal
right
that's
being
violated.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
and
one
of
those
i
was
suggesting
is
that
the
licensing
body
has
come
to
a
wrong
conclusion
as
to
some
facts.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
so,
he
could
have
a
factual
determination
by
the
court
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
and
then
that
could
be
applied
to
the
denial
of
the
renewal
and
his
legal
rights
would
be
protected.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
if
you
are
talking
about
the
66.054,
our
supreme
court
has
not
yet
interpreted
the
breadth
of
that
provision.
apparently,
no
one
has
ever
really
carried
a
case
under
that
statute
all
the
way
through.
they
usually
use
the
certiorari
provision
and
there
our
supreme
court
has
said
that
they
are
limited
to
a
review
of
arbitrary,
capricious
action.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
whatever
notes
are
in
the
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
was
the
report
of
this
committee.
the
committee
reports
to
the
council
and
then
the
council
acts
based
upon
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no
it
is
not
de
novo
on
certiorari.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
i
think
certiorari
is
discretionary
writ
which
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
i
am
sorry,
i
misled
you.
section
66.054
applies
to
the
beer
license.
you
can't
have
a
liquor
license
unless
you
first
have
a
beer
license.
now,
this
statute
which
has
not
been
really
interpreted
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
as
to
its
breadth
says
that
if
the
council
revokes
or
does
not
grant
a
license
for
good
cause
then
a
regular
court
proceeding
may
be
held
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
good
cause.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
a
de
novo
trial.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that's
the
applicants
choice
as
to
whether
he
wants
to
move
by
this
route
or
by
a
certiorari.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
if
he
has
factual,
excuse
me,
if
he
has
factual
issues
which
he
wishes
to
be
determined,
let's
take
for
instance
in
this
case.
let's
say
that
an
applicant
said,
well,
you
told
me
that
i
was
permitting
nude
dancing
and
you
wouldn't
renew
my
license
because
of
that
and
i
wasn't
permitting
nude
dancing
and
he
wants
a
factual
determination
of
that.
now
i
suggest
that
he
can
either
ask
the
council
and
this
basically
is
not
required
under
the
statute,
nor
supreme
court
said
it
was
necessary,
but
i
am
saying
that
he
could
ask
the
council
for
a
hearing
on
that
point
and
could
ask
to
bring
in
his
own
court
reporters
and
to
have
testimony
taken.
the
council
is
perfectly
capable
under
rules
of
administrative
law
of
setting
its
all
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
then
he
may
choose
one
of
these
two
judicial
routes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
right.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
there
is
one
exception,
the
certiorari
court
could
weigh
evidence
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
substantial
evidence.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
no,
they
could
refer
it
back
to
the
administrative
body.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
is
on
page
four
of
our
brief
section
66(054).
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
action
of
any
city
council,
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
that's
only
on
the
beer
license
which
is
a
necessary
step
to
get
a
liquor
license?
i
guess
we
qualify
first
for
beer
license
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
both
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yeah.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
then
it's
tested
by
arbitrary
capricious
act.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
the
statement
of
reasons
were
just
referred
to
by
justice
brennan.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
that
was
the
committee
report.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
the
statement
of
reason
that
was
adapted
by
the
council
was
because
these
bars
had
nude
dancing.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
it
is
in
the
--
these
were
stipulations
of
facts
that
were
entered.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
on
page
28
of
the
appendix.
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
relate
to
all
of
the
issues
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor,
on
page
32
number
26,
that
such
statutes
perform
both
in
customs
and
in
the
news.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
other
than
the
report
of
the
committee.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
they
adapted
the
committee
report.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
well,
the
council
as
a
whole
made
the
final
determination.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
these
cases
they
were
all
referred
to
the
city
council.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
they
were
in
fact
referred
to
city
council
and
they
adapted
the
reports
of
the
committee.
now,
the
committee
reports
are
in
fact
the
basis
for
the
legislative
action.
the
reasons
why
the
legislative
body
decided
that
they
would
resolve
not
to
have
nude
dancing
within
their
municipality.
now,
it's
true
that
this
record
is
not
specifically
set
out
that
resolution.
and
i
think
that,
that
is
a
not
a
federal
constitutional
question.
that's
a
question
of
state
law
as
to
whether
or
not
the
city
council
in
these
cases
actually
followed
the
state
law
when
they
adapted
the
resolution
that
they
would
not
license
nude
bars
within
their
communities.
now,
to
give
you
a
little
more
background
on
what
happened,
the
two
cities
when
faced
during
the
1970
license
year
with
nude
dancing
in
several
bars
and
after
receiving
over
two
thousand
petitions
in
the
city
of
kenosha
and
upward
of
25,000
in
the
city
of
racine,
the
councils
in
both
cities
passed
ordinances
which
regulated
costumes
in
cabarets.
this
required
the
dancers
to
cover
the
sexual
organs.
both
cities
were
enjoined
by
the
federal
district
court
in
december
of
1970.
from
that
point
until
the
next
licensing
year
in
1971,
the
city
which
--
both
these
cities
were
faced
with
a
dilemma
of
how
to
control
nude
dancing
in
the
bars
in
those
cities.
the
test
of
obscenity
was
difficult.
the
county
prosecutor
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
the
rule
we
think
solves
that
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
after
the
rule,
the
district
court
released
the
injunctions
that
had
permitted
the
nude
dancing
to
take
place
in
these
two
cities,
but
while
this
injunction
was
in
effect,
the
city
decided
that
they
would
not
re-license
these
bars
and
they
sat
as
a
legislative
body
in
doing
this.
they
did
not
sit
and
adjudicate
each
one
of
these
cases.
they
decided
that
they
would
not
permit
nude
dancing
in
their
cities
and
each
one
of
these
bars
in
each
city,
the
bars
were
treated
as
a
group
and
they
made
a
policy
statement
and
i
agree
that
the
committee
report
here
probably
does
not
satisfy
the
wisconsin
statute
in
regard
to
the
reasons
why
the
denials
were
made,
but
that
is
not
a
federal
constitutional
question.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
maybe
the
--
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
but
my
point
is
these
are
the
underlying
reasons
for
the
legislative
resolution.
the
legislative
resolution
is
why
these
licenses
were
denied.
they
all
were
featuring
nude
dancing.
both
these
communities
that
decided
that
they
would
not
permit
nude
dancing
anymore
and
the
reasons
why
they
would
not
permit
nude
dancing
were
the
item
set
out
in
the
committee
report.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
our
supreme
court
has
so
held.
we
have
the
power
to
do
away
with
all
bars.
each
municipality
can
decide
one
year
or
the
next.
they
can
wipe
out
every
bar
within
the
municipality
by
proper
legislative
action.
mr.
leroy
l.
dalton
yes,
sir.
