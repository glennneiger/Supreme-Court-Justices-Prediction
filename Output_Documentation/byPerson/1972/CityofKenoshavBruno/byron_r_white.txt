white
(inaudible)
they
canceled
it
in
midway
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
got
to
the
revocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
federal
court
enjoined
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
there
has
to
be
some
reason
for
(inaudible)
renew
a
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
on
renewal.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
original
application,
they
just
deny
it,
but
on
renewal
there
has
to
be
a
determination
of
some
kind
--
some
kind
of
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
is
different
than
an
original
application.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
state
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
he
is
not
entitled
on
a
renewal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
they
have
held
that
so
it
is
not
(inaudible)
hearing
that
the
fact-finding
hearing
or
a
final-type
hearing
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
assume
he
is
not
renewed
then
he
goes
to
court
over,
you
say
he
has
a
trail
do
novo?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
meanwhile
nothing
happens
to
it.
is
his
license
suspended
or
he
may
go
on
selling
while
he
gets
reviewed.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
has
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
gentleman
is
not
out
of
business
yet?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway
if
he
went
through
judicial
review
there
would
have
to
be
some
finding
of
some
kind
of
conduct
dis-entitling
him
to
renewal
in
order
to
sustain
the
refusal.
as
i
understood
a
while
ago
that
on
renewal
as
distinguished
from
original
applications
that
there
must
be
some
finding
of
some
conduct
dis-entitling
him
to
renewal
by
a
court
in
order
to
sustain
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
the
district,
in
order
to
affirm
the
refusal
to
renew
the
court
is
going
asked
to
define
or
is
going
to
have
to
agree
with
the
city
council
with
respect
to
this
alleged
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
on
certiorari
is
the
review
on
a
record,
i
thought
it
was
de
novo?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
not
called
any
witnesses
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
he
move
this
way
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
where
is
this
provision
that
you
are
talking
about
where
you
get
an
actual
judicial
trail?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
as
a
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
a
when
it
comes
up
renew
he
is
turned
down,
the
council
alleging
that
he
has
done
and
finding
if
he
has
done
a
and
b.
now,
that
he
has
then
a
right,
a
legal
right
to
go
to
court
and
have
a
de
novo
hearing
if
he
chooses
the
right
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
meanwhile
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
not
renewed
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
same
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
have
gotten
--
could
these
applicants
have
gotten
a
trial
type
hearing
in
some
court
by
some
procedure
after
their
renewal
was
denied
by
the
city
council?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
colleague
essentially
correct
with
respect
to
the
beer
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
well
then
you
take
it
your
own
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
no
evidentiary
hearing,
all
on
records,
reasons
and
notes?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
our
question
here,
whether
it
was
arbitrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
city
council
gives
no
reason
at
all,
is
it
automatically
arbitrary
to
deny
renewal?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
must
be
a
reason
for
denying
renewal?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
arbitrariness
of
denying
renewal
simply
turns
on
whether
it
states
a
reason
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
would
suppose
that
there
would
be
a
different
case
if
you
had
a
right
to
a
complete
de
novo
hearing
on
review
of
the
renewal
where
you
could
call
witnesses
and
statement
had
to
call
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
provision
that
your
colleague
referred
to
for
a
de
novo
hearing
on
denial
of
a
beer
license
renewal,
that
provision
was
not
considered
by
the
three-judge
court,
i
understand?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
not
consider
that
as
a
matter
of
wisconsin
law
or
in
connection
with
its
due
process
ruling?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
or
didn't
even
considered
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
each
of
these
gentlemen
had
his
beer
license
renewal
refused
and
could
have
gone
to
court
and
had
a
de
novo
hearing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
to
what
are
the
reasons
alleged
existed
or
not
and
let's
assume
that
were
true.
would
you
be
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
those
reasons
that
the
liquor
licenses
depended
on
the
existence
of
some
reasons
and
if
they
spend
the
term,
then
those
reasons
did
not
exist?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
was
just
curious
to
know
whether
the
district
court
addressed
itself
to
this
matter
at
all?

byron
