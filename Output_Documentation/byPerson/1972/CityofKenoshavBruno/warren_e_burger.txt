mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
wisconsin
statutes
could
they
have
a
program
of
saying
each
person
gets
a
license
for
one
year
and
just
rotate
it?
would
that
be
lawful
under
your
structure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
under
review
de
novo
or
a
trial
de
novo?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
to
just
review
on
any
records?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
council
fails
to
renew
that
after
the
end
of
one
year
to
distinguish
it
from
a
revocation,
when
they
fail
to
renew
it
they
must
give
a
statement
of
reasons,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it's
on
that
statement
of
reasons
that
whether
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
that
decides
whether
to
grant
a
review
by
certiorari?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page,
where
do
we
find
in
here
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
us
the
page,
where
do
we
find
it
in
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
the
stipulation
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
to
spend
much
time
on
that
view
with
the
holding
in
the
rule,
isn't
this
basically
a
procedural
problem
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
submit
to
you
that
at
the
bottom
of
your
page
32
that
you
referred
to
us,
paragraph
number
26,
and
on
the
opposite
page,
at
the
bottom
page
33,
paragraph
32
both
ascribe
that
direct
and
indirectly
as
reasons
for
not
finding
the
renewal
in
the
committee
reports
and
if
the
committee
reports
were
adapted
by
the
legislative
body
that
would
be
quite
adequate
statement
of
reasons
to
satisfy
me
as
to
why
they
had
failed
to
renew.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
now,
mr.
dalton
and
mr.
walrath,
will
you
be
the
only
one
acting,
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
respondents,
the
appellee
is
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
statement
of
reasons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
is
a
nature
of
the
legislative
licensing
process
sometimes.
you
take
a
category
of
people
and
they
say
they
are
not
going
to
be
in
or
they
will
be
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
fact,
that
whether
this
is
true
or
on
the
fact
--
on
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
legitimate
reason
for
non
renewal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
determine
the
fact
of
whether
these
events
took
place
or
whether
this
is
an
adequate
ground
for
a
non-renewal
or
former?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
responded
previously
to
the
question
i
put
to
you,
i
am
not
sure
which
case
you
were
referring
to,
but
turning
to
paragraph
number
26
on
page
32
of
the
appendix,
in
the
stipulation
of
facts,
they
have
stipulated
a
fact,
parties
have
stipulated
a
fact
which
under
the
larue
would
mean
non-renewal
of
the
license.
now,
do
you--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
then
in
paragraph
32,
a
page
later,
they
say
that
their
method
of
doing
business?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
includes
that
paragraph
26
reason.
how
do
you
get
away
from
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
purpose
of
paragraph
26
stipulation
if
it
was
not
to
bear
on
the
decision
to
renew
or
not
renew
the
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
do
you
dispute
that
this
is
a
good
enough
reason
not
to
renew
the
license?
do
you
challenge
that
after
larue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
that
time
this
court
decided
the
larue
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
after
the
larue
case,
isn't
paragraph
26
the
end
of
the
case
in
terms
of
whatever
cases
are
covered
by
that
stipulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view
of
the
due
process
question,
if
the
case
went
back
to
the
state,
went
back
to
the
district
court,
would
the
stipulation
paragraph
26
be
sufficient
if
they
put
that
and
only
that
in
evidence
of
the
reason
for
non-renewal?
because
the
city
council,
they
have
noticed,
went
through
all
its
processes
and
then
put
the
stipulation
in
evidence,
would
the
paragraph
26
be
sufficient
then
in
your
view
for
the
denial
of
the
renewal?
