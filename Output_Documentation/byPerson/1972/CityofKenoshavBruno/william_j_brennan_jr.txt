justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
determined
by
what
agency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
the
local
governing
caveat
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
has
to
give
an
adjudicatory
hearing
before
revocation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
discretionary
with
the
writ
or
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
what
court
does
that
goes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
is
a
review,
isn't
it,
that's
not
a
de
novo?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that
connection
mr.
dalton
and
i
am
looking
at
the
record
here
page
44,
i
do
not
know
which
of
the
cases
i
see
three
of
them
and
there
appears
there
a
report
of
the
committee
on
licensing
&
welfare
with
the
recitation
in
five
paragraphs
of
the
reasons
why
the
license
was
not
renewed,
and
then
that
was
followed
by
a
later
report
which
speaks
of
the
alleged
of
violence
and
threats
of
violence
and
feuding
between
the
management
of
the
pussycat
and
the
whatever
the
other
one
is.
now,
this
goes
up
on
certiorari
to
your
circuit
court.
now,
is
the
review
on
--
is
that
the
record
which
is
reviewed
that
we're
looking
that
these
two
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
case
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
discretionary
whether
or
not
of
the
circuit
court
will
give
you
that
review,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
the
applicant
seeking
a
renewal
get
any
fact
determination?
i
thought
you
suggested
to
mr.
justice
white
that
if
his
allegations
set
up
a
fact
issue
he
can
get
a
fact
determination
in
certiorari
in
the
circuit
court,
can
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
cannot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
do
you
mean
by
regular
court
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
de
novo
trial,
judicial
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
witnesses
and
fact
findings
and
all
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
now
when
does
the
alternative
of
certiorari
come
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
he
doesn't
have
to
do
that
and
so
he
doesn't
do
it
then
what
may
he
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
way
in
which
he
gets
a
fact-finding
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
he
follows
the
de
novo
route.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
follows
a
certiorari
route
he
does
not
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
wait
a
minute,
you
mean
take
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
you
have
a
renewal
of
the
beer
license
and
yet
be
denied
a
renewal
of
the
liquor
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,would
it
specifically
be
what
appears
at
page
44
to
46?
would
that
be
a
sample
of
the
return?
i
know
this
is
not
the
return
because
no
certiorari
proceeding
is
brought.
this
is
in
the
federal
court.
is
this
what
a
return
would
like?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
addition
then
there
would
be
what,
notes
you
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
would
not
be
here,
would
you
or
you
would
not
have
brought
the
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
have
gone
to
state
court
and
let
me
understand
this
clearly
now.
you
say
that
under
liquor
license
renewal,
the
only
way
open
to
you
in
the
way
of
judicial
review
is
certiorari
on
the
record
below.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
connection
of
the
beer
license
to
the
liquor
license?
i
thought
mr.
dalton
tell
us
you
never
get
to
a
liquor
license
question
until
you
have
been
granted
a
beer
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
about
these
appellees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
they
were,
then
as
i
understand,
you
might
have
gone
into
one
of
the
county
courts
or
the
circuit
court
and
got
a
de
novo
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what,
isn't
granting
cover
renewal,
toward
granting,
does
that
cover
renewal
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
determined
by
what
agency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
the
local
governing
caveat
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
has
to
give
an
adjudicatory
hearing
before
revocation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
discretionary
with
the
writ
or
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
what
court
does
that
goes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
is
a
review,
isn't
it,
that's
not
a
de
novo?
justice
william
j.

either
