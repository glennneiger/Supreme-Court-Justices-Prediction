the
option
is
exercised
by
the
voters?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
basic
option
was
exercised
by
the
voters,
but
then
that
the
governing
body
decided
who
to
license?
justice
potter
stewart
they
can't
without
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
has
to
be
a
petitioner,
a
referendum
petitioner?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
judicial
review?
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
revocation.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
record,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
no
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
under
the
law
the
committee
itself
could
have
acted
with
out
reference
to
the
council
as
i
read
in
the
statute
and
that's
what
the
complaint
of
your
brothers
on
the
other
side,
they
did
not
even
know
which
body
was
going
to
act,
whether
it
was
going
to
be
the
committee
or
the
council
as
a
whole.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
what
the
law
seems
to
say.
it
says,
all
town
and
the
village
boards
and
county
councils
or
the
duly
authorized
committees
of
such
councils
and
so
on
a
point
made
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
in
fact
in
these
cases
to
find
out.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
itself
is
on
page
34
and
35?
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
walrath,
i
appreciate
you
hardly
a
chance
to
get
the
first
sentence
out
of
here,
the
arguments
you
intended
to
make.
so
i
apologize
for
interrupting
you
again
but
i
have
a
basic
question
here
which
is
this,
the
due
process
clause
of
course,
covers
deprivations
of
life,
liberty
or
property
and
those
alone,
i
wondered
and
obviously
license
isn't
involved
here
and
i
wonder
now
how
you
define
what,
if
any,
liberty
and/or
property
is
involved.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
these
are
a
one-year
licenses
by
their
terms
and
under
state
law
that's
what
they
were
and
that
is
all
they
could
be?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
right,
so
that's
very
much
like
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
like
mr.
roth,
a
teaching
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
indicated
he
would
then
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
clear
his
name
if
the
charges
were
false?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
there
was
any
claim
here
that
this
kind
of
dancing
did
not
warrant
in
these
bars?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
you
argument
--
did
you
contend
that
in
any
way
there
was
a
common
law
kind
of
a
property
right
or
expectancy
to
a
renewal
each
year?
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court
did
not
rely
on
that
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
district
court
rather
relied
on
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
the
roth
case
which
was
subsequently
reversed
here,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
the
then
benefit
of
--
you
had
the
then
benefit
of
a
case
that
was
subsequently
reversed.
they
are
all
(inaudible)
in
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
need
the
reasons
if
you
have
the
law
on
your
side
in
the
seven
circuit,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
federal
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
34
and
35
is
the
findings
of
the
committee
adopted
by
the
common
council
and
one
of
those
municipalities
and
on
page

as
we
read
for
the
findings
of
the
committee
adopted
by
the
common
council
and
other
municipalities.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
are
quite
separate
from
what
the
stipulations
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
so
long
as
you
have
taken
charge
here.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
is
purely
a
due
process
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
due
process
issue
in
the
larue,
wasn't
there?

the
