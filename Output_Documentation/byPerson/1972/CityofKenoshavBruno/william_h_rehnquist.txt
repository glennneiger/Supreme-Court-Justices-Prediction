as
you
were
probably
in
monroe
against
pape,
this
court
said
that
section
1983
did
not
apply
to
municipal
corporations.
what
is
the
federal
statutory
basis
for
joining
the
city
of
racine
and
the
city
of
kenosha
in
this
action?
justice
william

here
is
what
this
court
said
in
monroe
against
pape,
“for
we
are
the
opinion
that
congress
did
not
undertake
to
bring
municipal
corporations
within
the
ambit
of
1983.”

that
is
correct.

would
not
read
that
language
as
being
addressed
particularly
to
damage
suits.

how
do
you
distinguish?
justice
william

i
mean
not
as
a
matter
of
seven
circuit
present

as
a
matter
of
reason?

am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
stipulations
in
the
district
court
weren't
necessarily
entered
into
by
all
the
parties?
you're
just
representing
a
fraction
i
take
it
of
the
parties
that
were
actually
in
the
district
court.
justice
william

so,
there
is
no
distinction
