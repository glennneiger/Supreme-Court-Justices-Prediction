justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
first
time
he
finds
out
what
the
board
acted
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
limits
etcetera
that
you
say
are
kept
for
the
certiorari
right
hearing.
does
he
see
those
before
the
certiorari
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
printed
and
available?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
after
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
does
the
applicant
have
before
the
city
council
acts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
maybe
i
am
using
the
word
hearing
wrong,
but
does
he
get
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
know
what
notice
means?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
he
get
a
notice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
why
there
is
a
possibility
that
it
will
not
be
renewed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
request.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
does
he
know
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
opposition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
a
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
people
testify
against
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
oath.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
only
hearing
he
gets
is
in
a
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
only
non-legislative
he
gets
is
in
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
provision
of
the
law
says
it
gives
him
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
where
are
the
statement
of
reasons
in
these
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
committee
on
license
wrote
that?
well,
that
doesn't
look
anything
to
me
like
a
statement
of
reason,
it
says,
the
report
of
the
committee.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
keep
saying
that
you
have
to
have
a
statement
of
reasons,
is
that
correct
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
is
that
in
this
case,
“a
statement
of
reason?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
statement
of
reason
is
in
the
stipulation
of
facts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
saying
statement
of
reasons
and
you
know
what
stipulation
of
facts,
is
that
statement
of
reasons?
statement
of
reason
is
that
as
i
understood
here
was
a
piece
of
paper
that
the
council
wrote
up
as
statement
of
reasons
for
denying
john
jones
renewal
of
his
license.
and
am
i
correct
there
is
no
such
instrument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
there
is
no
such
instrument
as
the
statement
of
reasons?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
then
when
you
say
statement
of
reason
you
mean
the
committee
report?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
not
reissuing
licenses,
just
by
not
issuing,
not
renewing
the
licenses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
certiorari,
the
judge
could
not
give
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
perplexed
about
this
criminal
complaint
on
page
69
as
they
give
on
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
doing
in
the
appendix?
how
did
they
get
in
there?
i
still
don't
know
how
did
they
get
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
we
do
have
something
in
this
record
about
nude
dancing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
record
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
don't
know
whether
this
report
is
from
the
city
council
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
whether
these
complaints
were
before
the
city
council
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
object
to
them
being
putting
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
huh?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
irrelevant
on
the
question
of
nude
dancing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
do
with
the
top
of
page
34
that
says
that
this
the
reason
for
the
denial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
first
full
sentence.
the
defendant
city
relied
on
such
entertainment
as
one
of
the
fact
as
producing
the
factors
producing
the
effects
enumerated
in
paragraph
(a
through
f
in
denying
of
a
license?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
what
i
am
talking
about
but
this
admits
that
the
reason
that
they
denied
it
was
because
of
nude
dancing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
word
in
that
doesn't
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
all
in
the
same
statement
here,
isn't
it?
it
is
all
according
to
same
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
the
review
of
this
case
goes
back
on
the
city
as
to
do
and
to
show
that
nude
dancing
and
then
that
is
against
their
policy
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
case,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
long
as
you
have
a
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
would
be
no
trouble
in
drawing
an
ordinance
that
would
cover
that
criminal
complaints,
there
would
be?
justice
thurgood

they
would
