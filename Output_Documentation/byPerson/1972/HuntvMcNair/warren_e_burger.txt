chief

burger
would
you
just
suspend
for
a
moment
until
we
get
clear,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
fine,
alright.
it
takes
a
moment
or
two
to
clear
the
decks.
you
may
proceed
now
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
the
state
ever
defaulted
on
a
revenue
bond
to
the
extent
that
you
could
call
it
a
default?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no.
in
the
experience
of
the
state,
do
you
--
if
you
happen
to
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
response
prompts
a
question,
a
hypothetical
question,
if
you’ll
permit
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
state
having
made
the
judgment
that
you
suggested
earlier,
the
state
made
the
judgment
that
rather
than
build
two
new
universities
or
three,
it
would
offer
to
these
colleges
in
the
state
that
they
would
build
needed
buildings
on
their
campus
or
near
it
and
leased
these
buildings
to
the
church-related
college,
straight
leasing
arrangement,
would
you
think
that
that
was
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
is
pretty
close
to
tilton
then,
if
you
had
that
approach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
concede
there’s
no
aid
--
your
complaint
is
not
that
there’s
aid
being
given
in
violation
of
the
religion
clauses.
chief

you’re

con

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
only
the
entanglement
that
you’re
concerned
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
say,
you
are
concerned
about
the
entanglement
but
then
going
back
to
justice
rehnquist’s
question
how
does
the
entanglement
produce
a
standing
platform
for
you
and
your
clients?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
maybe
if
there
is
a
standing
question
or
if
there
was
a
standing
question,
perhaps,
there
isn’t
one
anymore?
chief

thank

chief

mr.
sinkler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
there
a
difference
between
the
position
he
has
asserted
in
these
briefs
and
somewhat
modified
position
that
he
took
in
oral
argument
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understood
mr.
figg’s
litigation
position
in
this
court,
and
he’ll
correct
me
later
if
i
did
misunderstand
it.
once
that
the
state
gets
a
substantial
benefit,
the
state
gets
an
aid
by
being
relieved
to
enlarge
its
state
colleges,
and
in
exchange,
it
gives
this
“aid”
or
assistance
by
lending
its
credit
to
these
colleges.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
he
objects
to
is
the
entangling
relationship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
figg?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
you
might
add
to
that
their
power
to
select
the
governing
board
and
i
suppose
that’s
central
to
your
position.
chief
justice
warren

they

catholics

presbyterians

all
other
