justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
practicalities
of
these?
why
can’t
this
college
do
this
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think,
i
know
that
but
what
i’m
trying
to
get
at
is
what
is
the
reason
for
the
south
carolina
legislation?
what
brought
it
into
being?
were
the
colleges
unable
to
do
this
kind
of
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
here
asking
us
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
invalidate
the
statute.
would
you
throw
the
whole
statute
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
repeat
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
were
asking
us,
you
were
attacking
the
statute
here.
what
i’m
asking
you
is,
in
your
theory,
does
the
entire
statute
fall
or
would
you
be
content
if
certain
of
the
powers
granted
were
rejected.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don’t
--
you
do
not
claim
that
the
state
lending
its
credit
is
unconstitutional
in
the
sense
that
by
lending
its
credit,
the
institution
gets
a
much
lower
interest
rate
on
its
borrowers?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
degree
of
benefit,
you
do
not
contend
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you’re
going
strictly
on
the
entanglement?
justice
byron
r.
white
fairly
rather
than
any
benefit
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
go
on,
i
think
you
said
there
were
21
private
colleges
in
south
carolina
that
benefit
or
have
the
right
to
benefit
from
this
fund
of
this
board.
i
take
it
from
what
you’ve
just
said
in
response
to
chief
justice’s
questions
that
if
you
have
a
non-sectarian
college,
you
wouldn’t
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
percentage
of
the
student
body
had
this
college
is
baptist?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
restriction
on
taking
non-baptist
then
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i’d
like
to
ask
you
another
question
since
i
interrupted
you.
the
record
may
show
it
but
i
don’t
recall
it.
you
referred
to
the
responsibility
of
the
state
as
i
understood
you
to
fix
the
fees
charged
to
students
in
order
to
assure
that
revenues
are
sufficient,
is
that
the
way
statute
reads
or
does
the
indenture
merely
imposed
covenants
on
the
college
itself
to
fix
fees
that
are
adequate
to
service
the
debt.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
that
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
then
mr.
figg,
if
one
would
have
think
that
independently
of
the
entanglement
features
of
one
thought
that
the
aid
out
and
in
of
itself
was
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
you
would,
you’d
advance
that
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you’re
not
going
to
give
it
up
based
on
tilton,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
none
of
that
the
issue
is
here
for
us
to
decide?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
baptist
have
never
support
--
never
support
and
pay
the
expenses
of
the
college,
it
wouldn’t
be
suspect
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
practicalities
of
these?
why
can’t
this
college
do
this
