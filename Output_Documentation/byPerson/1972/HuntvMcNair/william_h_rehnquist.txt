what
is
your
client’s
standing
in
this
action?
how
does
he
claim
that
he
was
harmed
by
the
statute?
justice

rehnquist
but
if
you
prevail,
you’re
not
going
to
prevent
the
expenditure
of
any
tax
monies,
are
you?
if
you
prevail
and
simply
get
some
of
the
restrictions
taken
of,
presumably,
no
tax
monies
are
going
to
be
saved.

without
the

that
neither
of

that
the
--
it’s

of

state
in
this
type
of
situation?
justice
