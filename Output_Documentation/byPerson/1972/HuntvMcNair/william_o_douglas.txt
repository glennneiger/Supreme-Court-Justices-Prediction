justice

well,
mr.
sinkler,
mr.
figg’s
argument
puzzled
me
for
a
moment
because
i
thought
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
questions
imply
that
perhaps
he
was
saying,
“just
strip
out
the
entanglement
features
and
let
the
rest
of
the
statute
stand.”
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
isn’t
the
way
it
is.
the
relief
he
asked
for
in
this
complaint,
i’m
looking
at
page
10
is
an
order
declaring
that
the
act
here
above
mentioned
is
unconstitutional,
null
and
void.
and
that
sounds
to
me
as
if
he’s
saying
by
reason
of
excessive
entanglement;
the
wholes
statute
must
be
declared
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
let’s
assume
we
rejected
your
opponent’s
position
that
there
was
excessive
entanglement
and
put
aside
the
question
of
aid
that
he
says
isn’t
involved
in
the
suit,
there
would
still
be
the
question
there,
wouldn’t
there?

of
lending
the
state’s
credit.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
there’s
no
benefit
from
lending
the
state’s
credit?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
this
is
a
substantial
benefit?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
bound
counsel?
justice
william
o.
douglas
even
if
you’re
opponent
loss,
you
would
still
have
to
wrestle
with
that
issue
in
terms
of
whether
the
bonds
evaluated?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don’t
think
that
was
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
mr.
sinkler.
it
was,
as
i
understand
that,
at
least
i’d
like
to
ask
that
question.
if
there
is
state
aid
here,
some
kind
of
aid,
as
you
said
(voice
overlap)
benefit
to
the
institution.
then
isn’t
there
a
question,
may
i
ask
if
there’s
a
question
whether
independently
of
the
entanglement
features,
this
statute
violates
by
reason
of
the
aid
features,
by
reason
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
i
should
think
it’s
bound
--
bound
counsel,
you
would
like
the
whole
thing
decided
not
just
that
you
have
to
do.

william

do
you
think
the
issue
was
raised?
do
you

determined?
was

by
the
south
carolina
court?

william

douglas
they
decided
that
the
extent
of
aid
lent
was
not
violated
with
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
appellant,
your
opponent
didn’t
bring
that
part
of
the
issue
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
sinkler,
have
any
of
those
non-denominational
colleges
issued
bonds
under
this?
justice
william
o.
douglas
not
a
single
bond
has
been
issued
under
this?
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
you
had
a
default
on
a
bond
issue
like
this,
what
would
happen?
who
would
enforce
the
right
of
the
bondholders?
justice
william

would
the
state
do
anything?
