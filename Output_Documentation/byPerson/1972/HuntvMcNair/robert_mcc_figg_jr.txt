mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
which
upheld
against
the
challenge
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
a
transaction
between
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
the
baptist
college
of
charleston
wherein
made
under
a
1969
statute
entitled
the
educational
facilities
act.
the
transaction
on
behalf
of
the
state
was
to
be
conducted
by
its
educational
facilities
authority
which
this
act
provided
should
be
state’s
budget
and
control
board.
that
board
is
composed
of
the
governor,
the
state
treasurer,
the
comptroller
general,
the
legislative
and
two
legislative
chairmen
ex-official,
it’s
the
core
of
the
state
government.
it’s
the
governing
board
of
the
state’s
departments
of
finance,
property
and
personnel
and
the
act
gives
it
these
duties
which
i
shall
refer
to
“as
an
incident
of
its
functions
in
connection
with
the
public
finances
of
the
state.”
the
baptist
college
of
charleston
is
an
activity
of
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention
and
it’s
chartered
to
“operate
a
baptist
liberal
arts
college
for
educational
purposes.”
it
manages
the
affairs
of
the
college
and
trust
for
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention
and
the
courts
below
have
found
that
it
is
a
religious
activity
and
that
the
question
is
properly
raised
in
its
case
under
the
first
amendment
even
though
they
didn’t
agree
with
that
view
of
the
decision.
under
this
transaction,
the
--
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
state
under
its
own
constitution
cannot
give
a
grant
to
a
religious
institution
to
construct
a
building
or
a
facility
even
though
it’s
of
a
neutral
purpose
because
its
own
constitution
prohibits
direct
or
indirect
aide
to
a
sectarian
institution
and
our
code
has
said
that
that
means
that
no
state
funds
can
be
given
to
a
religious
institution.
it
undertakes
therefore
to
authorize
the
budget
and
control
board
which
as
i
say
is
the
core
of
the
state
government
to
issue
south
carolina
state
revenue
bonds
which
would
give
the
purchases
immunity
from
federal
income
taxation
on
the
interest
and
thereby
benefit
the
institution.
to
that
extent,
it
enables,
in
other
words
the
borrowing
on
behalf
of
the
college
to
be
at
a
lower
rate
of
interest
and
would
otherwise
supply
and
it
uses
in
order
to
accomplish
this,
the
format
of
legislation
under
which
was
commonly
known
as
self-liquidating
project
will
authorize
back
in
1933
and
1934
and
by
other
act
under
which
electrical
systems
and
water
works
and
what
not
were
financed
by
out
of
the
earnings
of
an
operation
and
out
of
the
profits,
the
fees
that
were
derived
from
the
consumers.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
if
our
state
has
ever
defaulted?
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
on
the
contrary,
our
supreme
court
has
made
a
statement
in
one
case
that
in
this
enlightened
age
the
state
will
not
allow
one
of
its
revenue
bond
issues
to
go
into
default
even
though
it’s
not
technically
liable
on
them
and
we’ve
never
had
a
default
on
our
revenue
bond
issue
of
the
electric
or
the
water
works
or
the
others.
now,
the
state
did
have
one
revenue
bond
issued
and
what
they
call
the
south
carolina
public
service
authority,
the
santee-cooper
hydroelectric
project
but
those
bonds
have
been
paid
over
the
operation
of
an
electrical
system
and
the
charges
to
consumers.
now,
this
is
a
little
different
though
from
the
usual
self-liquidating
projects
because
here,
they
do
not
let
the
project
issued
the
bonds
and
then
pay
off
out
of
its
operations
because
the
project
is
the
college
and
the
college
issuing
revenue
bonds
would
not
be
able
to
give
the
purchases
of
the
tax
immunity
which
the
state
can
give.
so,
what
the
state
does
is
to
take
a
conveyance
from
the
baptist
college
of
a
part
of
its
campus,
then
it
leases
its
back
at
an
agreed
rent,
leases
that
campus
back
at
an
agreed
rental
and
that
rental
is
of
course
calculated
to
pay
off
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
bonds
which
the
state
has
issued.
now,
the
act
provides
that
this
authority,
the
budget
and
control
board,
that
is
the
state
government’s
core,
issue
and
sell
to
the
public
state
of
south
carolina
general
revenue
bonds,
payable
principal
and
interest
only
from
the
rent
to
be
received
by
the
board
under
the
lease.
and
those
proceeds,
as
i
said,
are
to
be
spent
in
a
general
program
because
it’s
not
just
for
religious
colleges,
it’s
for
all
non-public
colleges
in
the
state
and
for
religiously
neutral
facilities,
these
building
and
facilities.
but
in
order
to
make
the
bond
saleable,
the
state
board
as
empowered
by
this
act
to
fix
and
revise
from
time
to
time
and
charge
and
collect
fees
and
charges
for
the
use
of
and
for
the
services
furnished
by
the
project.
so
that,
while
the
bonds
are
issued,
pledged
against
the
rents,
the
rents
will
never
change
because
you
don’t
need
to
raise
or
lower
the
rents.
the
rent
is
calculated
to
be
the
amount
required
to
pay
off
the
bond
issued.
what
the
board
have
to
do
with
and
in
seeing
that
the
rent
is
paid,
is
to
have
to
do
with
the
adequacy
of
the
fees
and
charges
for
the
use
of
the
project.
just
as
in
an
electrical
project,
the
project
itself
would
raise
or
lower
the
rate.
here,
the
state
assumes
by
legislation
a
responsibility
in
that
regard.
in
fact,
the
act
says
that
a
bondholder
can
compel
the
authority
to
exert
that
power
to
re-fix
and
revise
from
time
to
time
and
charge
and
collect
fees
and
charges
for
the
use
of
the
project.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
i
wouldn’t
--
i
don’t
know
that
they
are
specifically
authorized
to
do
that
but
they
are
commanded
to
see
that
enough
fees
and
charges
are
charged
by
the
college
to
pay
the
maintenance,
the
repair
and
the
operation
of
the
college
as
the
first
group
that
to
be
taken
into
account
in
fixing
and
revising
the
fees
and
then
next,
pay
the
principal
--
they’re
sufficient
to
pay
the
principal
and
interest
on
the
bond.
now,
i
would
just
ordinarily,
of
course
should
think
that
rent
came
in
operating
that
shows
you
the
language
here
is
more
referable
in
its
wording
to
an
ordinary
self-liquidating
project
but
it
does
point
out
the
fact
that
the
income,
the
funds
that
are
pledged
for
these
bonds
are
the
student
fees
and
charges.
not
just
the
rent
because
there
would
be
no
rent
if
the
fees
and
charges
are
not
adequate,
the
rent
wouldn’t
be
paid.
if
the
fees
and
charges
are
too
high
and
the
student
body
is
cut
down,
perhaps
the
rent
wouldn’t
be
paid.
if
the
college
got
discouraged,
perhaps
the
project
would
seize.
what
would
happen
then?
we
think
the
state
under
power
given
to
operate
these
projects
would
have
to
step
in
for
the
bondholders
and
see
that
the
religious
activity
is
operated.
now,
that
might
have
to
stop
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
just
as
all
other
colleges
do,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
can
and
i
think
that
it
--
it’s
an
annual
performance
especially
in
these
days
of
changing
course.
it’s
been
an
annual
performance
that
student
fees
at
virtually
all
institutions
are
not
only
fixed
every
year
but
affixed
higher
every
year.
the
requirements
have
been
going
up
and
of
course,
to
some
extent,
that
affects
the
patronage.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
the
reason
was
that
the
colleges,
i
suspect,
were
having
trouble
from
the
fact
that
not
being
public.
their
tuition
fees
have
been
larger
and
therefore
their
student
patronage
has
been
smaller.
and
the
state
has
interest
into
itself
because
of
that
fact.
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
to
be
a
public
purpose
to
stimulate
education
and
the
state
is
undertaking
to,
i
suppose
to
protect
itself
against
having
to
take
over.
the
load
has
been
carried
by
some
21
private
colleges
in
south
carolina.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
think
that
on
our
provision
under
the
first
amendment
is
that
any
--
that
what
involves
the
state
board,
that
is
the
board
of
budget
and
control
board
in
guarding
against
default
on
this
bonds,
we
think
that
it
has
to
keep
itself
informed
to
oversee
to
an
extent
the
fiscal
operations
of
this
college.
we
think
that
it’s
too
late
when
default
has
occurred.
we
think
that
it
has
a
duty,
if
not
spelled
out
in
so
many
words,
so
strongly
implied
by
the
powers
that
are
given
to
the
state
board
in
respect
to
the
payment
of
these
bonds.
we
think
it
has
a
duty
to
see
that
the
student
fees
and
charges
are
at
all
times
going
to
be
calculated
to
keep
that
rent
coming
in,
in
the
amount
that
will
discharge
the
bond.
if
these
were
an
ordinary
self-liquidating
project,
the
college
alone
would
in
the
first
instance
fix
its
income.
and
then,
if
that
were
insufficient,
as
i
recall,
a
trustee
would
be
appointed
by
the
court
to
operate
the
project
and
do
adjust
to
the
fees,
so
that
the
project
would
pay
out
and
this
is
the
normal
set
up
as
i
believe
of
the
self-liquidating
project.
in
this
case,--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that
the
unconstitutional
part
of
the
statute
if
it
is
unconstitutional
are
those
under
which
the
duty
is
either
expressly
or
by
implication
or
the
function
is
put
upon
the
state
board
to
fix
and
adjust
from
time
to
time
the
charges.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
it
would
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
we
do
not
contend
that.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
it’s
--
this
was
strictly
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right,
mr.
justice.
we
think
it’s
strictly
an
excessive
entanglement
proposition.
we
think
that
there
are
two
things
that
the
court,
we
asked
the
court
or
submit
to
the
court
our
entanglement
of
an
undesirable
nature
under
the
first
amendment.
one
is
that
the
state
should
busy
itself
with
the
operating
affairs
of
a
religious
activity
to
be
sure
that
it
pays
off
bonds
issued
in
the
name
of
the
state.
and
the
other
is,
that
it
be
under
the
eventual
possibility
of
having
to
take
over
and
operate
it
because
it
in
effect
is
the
operator
of
the
project
when
you
apply
a
self-liquidating
piece
of
legislation
to
it.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
it
wouldn’t
seem
so
under
the
first
amendment,
as
i
understand
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
tilton
case,
our
court
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right
and
i
think
if
the
state
of
south
carolina
had
given
these
people
the
money
to
build
this
and
walked
away
and
forgotten
about
it,
as
the
government
did
in
tilton,
except
for
the
common
and
against
religious
use,
i
think
that
it
would’ve
been
valid
under
the
first
amendment.
our
state
couldn’t
do
that
because
of
its
own
constitution
and
so
this
has
been
the
approach
to
adopt
the
ordinary
self-liquidating
project
legislation
to
getting
around
its
own
constitution
which
prohibits
it
from
doing
what
the
government
did
in
the
tilton
case.
so
that
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
certainly
not
all.
i
believe
that
the
student
body
would
be
mostly
baptist.
i’d
say
the
majority
is
baptist.
60%
i’m
told
by
my
colleague
who
is
better
acquainted
with
the
affairs
of
the
institution
than
i
am
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
not
at
all.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
on
page
41
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
is
where
the
act
itself
is
set
out
under
subsection
l.
it
reads
“the
authority
may
fix,
revise,
charge
and
collect
rates,
rent
fees
charges
for
the
use
of
and
for
the
services
furnished
or
to
be
furnished
by
its
project
and
may
contract
with
any
person
so
forth
in
respect
to
it.
such
rates,
rents,
fees
and
charges
shall
be
fixed
and
adjusted
in
respect
of
the
aggregative
rates,
rents
fees
and
charges
from
such
project
so
as
to
provide
fund
sufficient
with
other
revenues
if
anyone
to
pay
the
cost
of
maintaining,
repairing
and
operating
the
project
in
each
and
every
portion
thereof
to
the
extent
that
the
payment
of
such
costs
is
not
otherwise
been
adequately
provided
for
to
pay
the
principal
of
and
the
interest
on
outstanding
revenue
bonds
of
the
authority
issued
in
respect
of
such
project
as
the
same
shall
become
due
and
payable
in
three
and
so
forth.”
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
and
then
it
provides
such
rates
and
so
forth
shall
not
be
subject
to
supervision
or
regulation
by
any
other
department,
commission,
board
and
so
forth
other
then
the
authority.
now,
the
other
place
for
the
fixing
of
rates
and
fees
is
on
page
36.
the
authority
has
given
the
power
to
determine
the
location
and
character
of
any
project
to
be
financed
to
construct,
reconstruct
model,
maintain,
repair,
operate,
lease
of
lessee
or
lessor
and
so
forth.
and
then
it’s
to
designate
a
participating
institution
for
higher
education
as
each
agent
to
determine
the
location
and
to
build
it
and
operate
it.
and
as
the
agent
of
the
authority,
they
enter
into
contracts
for
any
or
all
of
such
purposes
including
contracts
for
the
management
in
operation
of
such
projects.
so,
the
authority
legislatively
given
is
--
to
the
power
of
legislatively
given
to
the
authority
is
to
do
all
of
this
and
to
constitute
the
college
as
its
agent
in
accomplishing
its
construction,
its
operation,
its
financing,
its
fee
charging
and
everything
else.
and
then
subsection
f
to
issue
bonds,
that’s
where
as
the
bond
section
and
g
generally
to
fix
and
revise
from
time
to
time
and
charge
and
collect
rates,
rent
fees
and
charges
for
the
use
of
or
for
the
services
furnished
or
to
be
furnished
by
a
project
or
any
portion
thereof
and
to
contract
and
so
forth
and
to
establish
rules
and
regulations
for
the
use
of
a
project.
now,
i’m
not
sure
that
all
of
that
language
would
be
in
just
those
words
as
the
act
had
been
tailored
for
this
particular
transaction.
i
think
what
the
court
have
occurred
is
that
language
of
the
ordinary
self-liquidating
project
statute
has
been
put
in
here
and
the
authority
thereby
has
been
--
has
been
endowed
with
the
powers
of
the
ordinary
operator
of
a
self-liquidating
project.
and
if
it’s
going
to
do
what
the
statute
says
that
it’s
empowered
to
do
and
as
the
bondholders
under
subsection
n
of
the
act
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
and
get
an
order
than
it
do,
it
has
got
to
be
well-posted
on
the
daily
and
the
monthly
and
the
yearly
affairs
of
this
college.
it’s
got
to
do
what
the
ordinary
responsible
project
will
do
for
itself
in
always
seeing
the
operation
and
we
submit
that
this
whole
fee
provision,
these
fee
powers,
after
all,
fixing
fees
is
a
continuous
process.
there’s
no
formula
for
it.
it
involves
estimates.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
oh
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
he’s
a
citizen
and
taxpayer
whose
interest
would
be
affected
like
in
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
think
that
the
spending
of
tax
monies
has
been
avoided
by
this
process.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
there’s
no
aid
being
given
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
don’t
think
so,
under
the
decision
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
what
is
the
entanglement?
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
we
would
say,
if
your
honor
please,
i
suspect
that
we
don’t
have
a
standing
problem
in
this
case
under
the
--
under
the
state
procedure
if
there’s
a
standing
problem
under
the
first
amendment
then
it
arises
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
that
question
hasn’t
been
raised
below
and
the
court
below
considered
that
the
plaintiff
had
standing,
i
believe.
in
the
circuit
court,
the
question
wasn’t
raised
on
appeal,
it
wasn’t
raised
the
first
time
this
case
came
up
to
this
court
and
it
hasn’t
been
raised
on
the
second
time.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
that
could
be
very
well
be.
i
must
confess
that
i
haven’t
given
too
much
thought
to
the
question
of
standing
because
before
i
entered
this
case,
the
court
had
been
satisfied
by
the
standing
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
question
has
never
come
and
we
didn’t
anticipate
that
that
would
be.
as
i’ve
tried
to
make
a
claim,
i
don’t
see
anything
but
an
entanglement
question
but
i
do
think
that
the
responsibilities
put
upon
the
state
government
--
i
would
think
that
this
plaintiff
who
has
brought
his
complaint
as
a
citizen
and
a
resident
of
the
state
of
south
carolina,
the
state
has
recognized
that
he
has
some
interest
in
its
operation
here.
it’s
the
court
to
recognize
that
interest
and
i
think
it
could
very
well
be
that
his
interest
in
the
censuses
of
controversy
between
one
of
its
citizens
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
as
to
whether
it
is
violating
the
fundamental
law
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
of
the
state
which
he
first
challenged.
he
challenged
both
that
this
court
could
very
well
consider
that
it’s
the
standing
between
the
citizen
and
his
government
rather
than
a
monetary
standing
under
the
first
amendment.
i’m
not
sure
that
the
first
amendment
is
necessarily
a
monetary
question.
i
think
that
question
goes
beyond
perhaps
the
amount
of
taxes
he
might
have
to
pay
or
any
other
question.
and
to
conclude,
if
your
honors
please,
the
entanglement
of
fixing
fees,
we
think
which
involves
the
previous
year
of
surplus
or
deficit,
the
amount
of
maintenance
expected,
the
repairs,
insurance,
the
depreciations,
salaries
or
wages,
supplies,
rents
and
so
forth
that
all
of
that
has
got
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
state
in
advance
of
the
fixing
of
fees,
default
us
to
be
guarded
against
and
not
awaited
before
the
state
would
take
action
in
discharge
of
the
statutory
duties.
and
in
the
event
that
the
college
proved
unable
or
unwilling
to
continue,
then
we
think
that
in
the
end,
the
fact
that
the
state
would
have
to
see
to
the
operation
of
this
religious
activity
to
pay
off
the
bond
in
itself
will
produce
objection
of
an
entanglement
between
government
and
the
church
activity.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
if
you’ll
endorse
me
for
a
couple
of
moments,
your
honor,
you
--
i
did
not
intend
to
cut
down
the
attack
that
was
made
in
the
original
complaint
on
this
litigation
by
the
position
i
took
here
today
but
the
tilton
case
was
decided
since
his
complaint
withdrawn
and
i’m
not
sure
it
would’ve
been
drawn
the
same
way.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
until
we
tried
to
apply
the
tilton
case
to
this
case.
i
thought
the
aid
itself
and
we’ve
contend
it
in
the
first
argument
in
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
didn’t
intend
to
give
it
up
but
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes.
what
we
were
trying
to
do
here
was
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
entanglement
theory
because
i
believe
both
of
walz
case
and
the
tilton
case
have
been
decided
since
this
complaint
was
drawn
and
presented
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
it’s
chartered
to
operate
a
baptist
liberal
arts
college.
its
trustees
reported
by
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention.
it
operates
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
it
has
an
open
admissions
policy.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
neither
its
students
nor
its
faculty
eliminated
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
don’t
think
they’re
require
to
take
any
course
and
merely
offer
a
baptist
offering
but
i
know
this
that
when
i
believe
that
counsel
in
this
case
were
arguing
at
one
time
that
it
wasn’t
a
baptist
activity
and
i
think
there’s
a
certain
baptist,
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention
called
them
on
the
cop,
didn’t
he?[laughter]
and
told
them
he
was.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
the
circuit
judge
said
it
was
at
least
in
part
a
function
of
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
they
give
them
capital
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
the
baptist
thinks
that
it’s
a
religious
activity
of
theirs.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
it’s
evident.
this
institution
is
an
activity
of
the
baptist
of
the
south
carolina
and
i
believe
that
they
think,
regardless
of
this
application
for
assistance
that
governmental
interference
with
what
they’re
doing
here
would
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
they
think
that
this
is
a
religious
activity.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
it
wouldn’t
bind
the
court
but
at
some
evidence
of
what
they
think
they’re
doing
is
some
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
because
it
was
created
to
include
in
its
curriculum
from
religious
courses
and
offerings
and
instruction
in
preparation
to
be
a
baptist
preacher.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
what
they
think
as
the
baptist
approach
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right.
they
have
courses
that
lead
up
to
being
a
baptist
minister.
now,
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
they
do,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
i
said,
they
give
courses.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
i’m
not
--
this
is
a
fairly
new
educational
institution,
isn’t
it
and
it
hasn’t
yet
developed
to
the
point
that
i
think
the
baptist
intended
it
to
develop.
now,
this
is,
this
--[laughter]
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
the
board
of
trustees
here
is
named
by
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention.
now,
they
don’t
have
to
be
baptist
but
they
are
appointed.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
they
are
appointed.
the
whole
board
and
the
operator
they
entrust
for
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
and
when
they
got
the
charter,
they
wrote
in
there
to
operate
a
baptist
liberal
arts
charter.
now,
they
are
in
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
it
does,
mr.
justice.
the
only
other
observation
i
want
to
make
was
that.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
if
they
haven’t
done
it?
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
i
don’t
think.
i
think
they
could
contribute
to
it.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
to
me,
it’s
because
they
think
it
is.[laughter]
and
i
take
that
as
evidence
that
they’ve
accomplished
what
they
should
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
that’s
all.
that’s
all
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
the
naming
of
the
board
of
trustees.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
which
upheld
against
the
challenge
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
a
transaction
between
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
the
baptist
college
of
charleston
wherein
made
under
a
1969
statute
entitled
the
educational
facilities
act.
the
transaction
on
behalf
of
the
state
was
to
be
conducted
by
its
educational
facilities
authority
which
this
act
provided
should
be
state’s
budget
and
control
board.
that
board
is
composed
of
the
governor,
the
state
treasurer,
the
comptroller
general,
the
legislative
and
two
legislative
chairmen
ex-official,
it’s
the
core
of
the
state
government.
it’s
the
governing
board
of
the
state’s
departments
of
finance,
property
and
personnel
and
the
act
gives
it
these
duties
which
i
shall
refer
to
“as
an
incident
of
its
functions
in
connection
with
the
public
finances
of
the
state.”
the
baptist
college
of
charleston
is
an
activity
of
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention
and
it’s
chartered
to
“operate
a
baptist
liberal
arts
college
for
educational
purposes.”
it
manages
the
affairs
of
the
college
and
trust
for
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention
and
the
courts
below
have
found
that
it
is
a
religious
activity
and
that
the
question
is
properly
raised
in
its
case
under
the
first
amendment
even
though
they
didn’t
agree
with
that
view
of
the
decision.
under
this
transaction,
the
--
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
state
under
its
own
constitution
cannot
give
a
grant
to
a
religious
institution
to
construct
a
building
or
a
facility
even
though
it’s
of
a
neutral
purpose
because
its
own
constitution
prohibits
direct
or
indirect
aide
to
a
sectarian
institution
and
our
code
has
said
that
that
means
that
no
state
funds
can
be
given
to
a
religious
institution.
it
undertakes
therefore
to
authorize
the
budget
and
control
board
which
as
i
say
is
the
core
of
the
state
government
to
issue
south
carolina
state
revenue
bonds
which
would
give
the
purchases
immunity
from
federal
income
taxation
on
the
interest
and
thereby
benefit
the
institution.
to
that
extent,
it
enables,
in
other
words
the
borrowing
on
behalf
of
the
college
to
be
at
a
lower
rate
of
interest
and
would
otherwise
supply
and
it
uses
in
order
to
accomplish
this,
the
format
of
legislation
under
which
was
commonly
known
as
self-liquidating
project
will
authorize
back
in
1933
and
1934
and
by
other
act
under
which
electrical
systems
and
water
works
and
what
not
were
financed
by
out
of
the
earnings
of
an
operation
and
out
of
the
profits,
the
fees
that
were
derived
from
the
consumers.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
if
our
state
has
ever
defaulted?
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
on
the
contrary,
our
supreme
court
has
made
a
statement
in
one
case
that
in
this
enlightened
age
the
state
will
not
allow
one
of
its
revenue
bond
issues
to
go
into
default
even
though
it’s
not
technically
liable
on
them
and
we’ve
never
had
a
default
on
our
revenue
bond
issue
of
the
electric
or
the
water
works
or
the
others.
now,
the
state
did
have
one
revenue
bond
issued
and
what
they
call
the
south
carolina
public
service
authority,
the
santee-cooper
hydroelectric
project
but
those
bonds
have
been
paid
over
the
operation
of
an
electrical
system
and
the
charges
to
consumers.
now,
this
is
a
little
different
though
from
the
usual
self-liquidating
projects
because
here,
they
do
not
let
the
project
issued
the
bonds
and
then
pay
off
out
of
its
operations
because
the
project
is
the
college
and
the
college
issuing
revenue
bonds
would
not
be
able
to
give
the
purchases
of
the
tax
immunity
which
the
state
can
give.
so,
what
the
state
does
is
to
take
a
conveyance
from
the
baptist
college
of
a
part
of
its
campus,
then
it
leases
its
back
at
an
agreed
rent,
leases
that
campus
back
at
an
agreed
rental
and
that
rental
is
of
course
calculated
to
pay
off
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
bonds
which
the
state
has
issued.
now,
the
act
provides
that
this
authority,
the
budget
and
control
board,
that
is
the
state
government’s
core,
issue
and
sell
to
the
public
state
of
south
carolina
general
revenue
bonds,
payable
principal
and
interest
only
from
the
rent
to
be
received
by
the
board
under
the
lease.
and
those
proceeds,
as
i
said,
are
to
be
spent
in
a
general
program
because
it’s
not
just
for
religious
colleges,
it’s
for
all
non-public
colleges
in
the
state
and
for
religiously
neutral
facilities,
these
building
and
facilities.
but
in
order
to
make
the
bond
saleable,
the
state
board
as
empowered
by
this
act
to
fix
and
revise
from
time
to
time
and
charge
and
collect
fees
and
charges
for
the
use
of
and
for
the
services
furnished
by
the
project.
so
that,
while
the
bonds
are
issued,
pledged
against
the
rents,
the
rents
will
never
change
because
you
don’t
need
to
raise
or
lower
the
rents.
the
rent
is
calculated
to
be
the
amount
required
to
pay
off
the
bond
issued.
what
the
board
have
to
do
with
and
in
seeing
that
the
rent
is
paid,
is
to
have
to
do
with
the
adequacy
of
the
fees
and
charges
for
the
use
of
the
project.
just
as
in
an
electrical
project,
the
project
itself
would
raise
or
lower
the
rate.
here,
the
state
assumes
by
legislation
a
responsibility
in
that
regard.
in
fact,
the
act
says
that
a
bondholder
can
compel
the
authority
to
exert
that
power
to
re-fix
and
revise
from
time
to
time
and
charge
and
collect
fees
and
charges
for
the
use
of
the
project.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
i
wouldn’t
--
i
don’t
know
that
they
are
specifically
authorized
to
do
that
but
they
are
commanded
to
see
that
enough
fees
and
charges
are
charged
by
the
college
to
pay
the
maintenance,
the
repair
and
the
operation
of
the
college
as
the
first
group
that
to
be
taken
into
account
in
fixing
and
revising
the
fees
and
then
next,
pay
the
principal
--
they’re
sufficient
to
pay
the
principal
and
interest
on
the
bond.
now,
i
would
just
ordinarily,
of
course
should
think
that
rent
came
in
operating
that
shows
you
the
language
here
is
more
referable
in
its
wording
to
an
ordinary
self-liquidating
project
but
it
does
point
out
the
fact
that
the
income,
the
funds
that
are
pledged
for
these
bonds
are
the
student
fees
and
charges.
not
just
the
rent
because
there
would
be
no
rent
if
the
fees
and
charges
are
not
adequate,
the
rent
wouldn’t
be
paid.
if
the
fees
and
charges
are
too
high
and
the
student
body
is
cut
down,
perhaps
the
rent
wouldn’t
be
paid.
if
the
college
got
discouraged,
perhaps
the
project
would
seize.
what
would
happen
then?
we
think
the
state
under
power
given
to
operate
these
projects
would
have
to
step
in
for
the
bondholders
and
see
that
the
religious
activity
is
operated.
now,
that
might
have
to
stop
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
just
as
all
other
colleges
do,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
can
and
i
think
that
it
--
it’s
an
annual
performance
especially
in
these
days
of
changing
course.
it’s
been
an
annual
performance
that
student
fees
at
virtually
all
institutions
are
not
only
fixed
every
year
but
affixed
higher
every
year.
the
requirements
have
been
going
up
and
of
course,
to
some
extent,
that
affects
the
patronage.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
the
reason
was
that
the
colleges,
i
suspect,
were
having
trouble
from
the
fact
that
not
being
public.
their
tuition
fees
have
been
larger
and
therefore
their
student
patronage
has
been
smaller.
and
the
state
has
interest
into
itself
because
of
that
fact.
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
to
be
a
public
purpose
to
stimulate
education
and
the
state
is
undertaking
to,
i
suppose
to
protect
itself
against
having
to
take
over.
the
load
has
been
carried
by
some
21
private
colleges
in
south
carolina.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
think
that
on
our
provision
under
the
first
amendment
is
that
any
--
that
what
involves
the
state
board,
that
is
the
board
of
budget
and
control
board
in
guarding
against
default
on
this
bonds,
we
think
that
it
has
to
keep
itself
informed
to
oversee
to
an
extent
the
fiscal
operations
of
this
college.
we
think
that
it’s
too
late
when
default
has
occurred.
we
think
that
it
has
a
duty,
if
not
spelled
out
in
so
many
words,
so
strongly
implied
by
the
powers
that
are
given
to
the
state
board
in
respect
to
the
payment
of
these
bonds.
we
think
it
has
a
duty
to
see
that
the
student
fees
and
charges
are
at
all
times
going
to
be
calculated
to
keep
that
rent
coming
in,
in
the
amount
that
will
discharge
the
bond.
if
these
were
an
ordinary
self-liquidating
project,
the
college
alone
would
in
the
first
instance
fix
its
income.
and
then,
if
that
were
insufficient,
as
i
recall,
a
trustee
would
be
appointed
by
the
court
to
operate
the
project
and
do
adjust
to
the
fees,
so
that
the
project
would
pay
out
and
this
is
the
normal
set
up
as
i
believe
of
the
self-liquidating
project.
in
this
case,--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that
the
unconstitutional
part
of
the
statute
if
it
is
unconstitutional
are
those
under
which
the
duty
is
either
expressly
or
by
implication
or
the
function
is
put
upon
the
state
board
to
fix
and
adjust
from
time
to
time
the
charges.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
it
would
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
we
do
not
contend
that.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
it’s
--
this
was
strictly
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right,
mr.
justice.
we
think
it’s
strictly
an
excessive
entanglement
proposition.
we
think
that
there
are
two
things
that
the
court,
we
asked
the
court
or
submit
to
the
court
our
entanglement
of
an
undesirable
nature
under
the
first
amendment.
one
is
that
the
state
should
busy
itself
with
the
operating
affairs
of
a
religious
activity
to
be
sure
that
it
pays
off
bonds
issued
in
the
name
of
the
state.
and
the
other
is,
that
it
be
under
the
eventual
possibility
of
having
to
take
over
and
operate
it
because
it
in
effect
is
the
operator
of
the
project
when
you
apply
a
self-liquidating
piece
of
legislation
to
it.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
it
wouldn’t
seem
so
under
the
first
amendment,
as
i
understand
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
tilton
case,
our
court
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right
and
i
think
if
the
state
of
south
carolina
had
given
these
people
the
money
to
build
this
and
walked
away
and
forgotten
about
it,
as
the
government
did
in
tilton,
except
for
the
common
and
against
religious
use,
i
think
that
it
would’ve
been
valid
under
the
first
amendment.
our
state
couldn’t
do
that
because
of
its
own
constitution
and
so
this
has
been
the
approach
to
adopt
the
ordinary
self-liquidating
project
legislation
to
getting
around
its
own
constitution
which
prohibits
it
from
doing
what
the
government
did
in
the
tilton
case.
so
that
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
certainly
not
all.
i
believe
that
the
student
body
would
be
mostly
baptist.
i’d
say
the
majority
is
baptist.
60%
i’m
told
by
my
colleague
who
is
better
acquainted
with
the
affairs
of
the
institution
than
i
am
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
not
at
all.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
on
page
41
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
is
where
the
act
itself
is
set
out
under
subsection
l.
it
reads
“the
authority
may
fix,
revise,
charge
and
collect
rates,
rent
fees
charges
for
the
use
of
and
for
the
services
furnished
or
to
be
furnished
by
its
project
and
may
contract
with
any
person
so
forth
in
respect
to
it.
such
rates,
rents,
fees
and
charges
shall
be
fixed
and
adjusted
in
respect
of
the
aggregative
rates,
rents
fees
and
charges
from
such
project
so
as
to
provide
fund
sufficient
with
other
revenues
if
anyone
to
pay
the
cost
of
maintaining,
repairing
and
operating
the
project
in
each
and
every
portion
thereof
to
the
extent
that
the
payment
of
such
costs
is
not
otherwise
been
adequately
provided
for
to
pay
the
principal
of
and
the
interest
on
outstanding
revenue
bonds
of
the
authority
issued
in
respect
of
such
project
as
the
same
shall
become
due
and
payable
in
three
and
so
forth.”
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
and
then
it
provides
such
rates
and
so
forth
shall
not
be
subject
to
supervision
or
regulation
by
any
other
department,
commission,
board
and
so
forth
other
then
the
authority.
now,
the
other
place
for
the
fixing
of
rates
and
fees
is
on
page
36.
the
authority
has
given
the
power
to
determine
the
location
and
character
of
any
project
to
be
financed
to
construct,
reconstruct
model,
maintain,
repair,
operate,
lease
of
lessee
or
lessor
and
so
forth.
and
then
it’s
to
designate
a
participating
institution
for
higher
education
as
each
agent
to
determine
the
location
and
to
build
it
and
operate
it.
and
as
the
agent
of
the
authority,
they
enter
into
contracts
for
any
or
all
of
such
purposes
including
contracts
for
the
management
in
operation
of
such
projects.
so,
the
authority
legislatively
given
is
--
to
the
power
of
legislatively
given
to
the
authority
is
to
do
all
of
this
and
to
constitute
the
college
as
its
agent
in
accomplishing
its
construction,
its
operation,
its
financing,
its
fee
charging
and
everything
else.
and
then
subsection
f
to
issue
bonds,
that’s
where
as
the
bond
section
and
g
generally
to
fix
and
revise
from
time
to
time
and
charge
and
collect
rates,
rent
fees
and
charges
for
the
use
of
or
for
the
services
furnished
or
to
be
furnished
by
a
project
or
any
portion
thereof
and
to
contract
and
so
forth
and
to
establish
rules
and
regulations
for
the
use
of
a
project.
now,
i’m
not
sure
that
all
of
that
language
would
be
in
just
those
words
as
the
act
had
been
tailored
for
this
particular
transaction.
i
think
what
the
court
have
occurred
is
that
language
of
the
ordinary
self-liquidating
project
statute
has
been
put
in
here
and
the
authority
thereby
has
been
--
has
been
endowed
with
the
powers
of
the
ordinary
operator
of
a
self-liquidating
project.
and
if
it’s
going
to
do
what
the
statute
says
that
it’s
empowered
to
do
and
as
the
bondholders
under
subsection
n
of
the
act
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
and
get
an
order
than
it
do,
it
has
got
to
be
well-posted
on
the
daily
and
the
monthly
and
the
yearly
affairs
of
this
college.
it’s
got
to
do
what
the
ordinary
responsible
project
will
do
for
itself
in
always
seeing
the
operation
and
we
submit
that
this
whole
fee
provision,
these
fee
powers,
after
all,
fixing
fees
is
a
continuous
process.
there’s
no
formula
for
it.
it
involves
estimates.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
oh
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
he’s
a
citizen
and
taxpayer
whose
interest
would
be
affected
like
in
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
think
that
the
spending
of
tax
monies
has
been
avoided
by
this
process.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
there’s
no
aid
being
given
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
don’t
think
so,
under
the
decision
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
what
is
the
entanglement?
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
we
would
say,
if
your
honor
please,
i
suspect
that
we
don’t
have
a
standing
problem
in
this
case
under
the
--
under
the
state
procedure
if
there’s
a
standing
problem
under
the
first
amendment
then
it
arises
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
that
question
hasn’t
been
raised
below
and
the
court
below
considered
that
the
plaintiff
had
standing,
i
believe.
in
the
circuit
court,
the
question
wasn’t
raised
on
appeal,
it
wasn’t
raised
the
first
time
this
case
came
up
to
this
court
and
it
hasn’t
been
raised
on
the
second
time.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
that
could
be
very
well
be.
i
must
confess
that
i
haven’t
given
too
much
thought
to
the
question
of
standing
because
before
i
entered
this
case,
the
court
had
been
satisfied
by
the
standing
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
question
has
never
come
and
we
didn’t
anticipate
that
that
would
be.
as
i’ve
tried
to
make
a
claim,
i
don’t
see
anything
but
an
entanglement
question
but
i
do
think
that
the
responsibilities
put
upon
the
state
government
--
i
would
think
that
this
plaintiff
who
has
brought
his
complaint
as
a
citizen
and
a
resident
of
the
state
of
south
carolina,
the
state
has
recognized
that
he
has
some
interest
in
its
operation
here.
it’s
the
court
to
recognize
that
interest
and
i
think
it
could
very
well
be
that
his
interest
in
the
censuses
of
controversy
between
one
of
its
citizens
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
as
to
whether
it
is
violating
the
fundamental
law
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
of
the
state
which
he
first
challenged.
he
challenged
both
that
this
court
could
very
well
consider
that
it’s
the
standing
between
the
citizen
and
his
government
rather
than
a
monetary
standing
under
the
first
amendment.
i’m
not
sure
that
the
first
amendment
is
necessarily
a
monetary
question.
i
think
that
question
goes
beyond
perhaps
the
amount
of
taxes
he
might
have
to
pay
or
any
other
question.
and
to
conclude,
if
your
honors
please,
the
entanglement
of
fixing
fees,
we
think
which
involves
the
previous
year
of
surplus
or
deficit,
the
amount
of
maintenance
expected,
the
repairs,
insurance,
the
depreciations,
salaries
or
wages,
supplies,
rents
and
so
forth
that
all
of
that
has
got
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
state
in
advance
of
the
fixing
of
fees,
default
us
to
be
guarded
against
and
not
awaited
before
the
state
would
take
action
in
discharge
of
the
statutory
duties.
and
in
the
event
that
the
college
proved
unable
or
unwilling
to
continue,
then
we
think
that
in
the
end,
the
fact
that
the
state
would
have
to
see
to
the
operation
of
this
religious
activity
to
pay
off
the
bond
in
itself
will
produce
objection
of
an
entanglement
between
government
and
the
church
activity.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
if
you’ll
endorse
me
for
a
couple
of
moments,
your
honor,
you
--
i
did
not
intend
to
cut
down
the
attack
that
was
made
in
the
original
complaint
on
this
litigation
by
the
position
i
took
here
today
but
the
tilton
case
was
decided
since
his
complaint
withdrawn
and
i’m
not
sure
it
would’ve
been
drawn
the
same
way.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
until
we
tried
to
apply
the
tilton
case
to
this
case.
i
thought
the
aid
itself
and
we’ve
contend
it
in
the
first
argument
in
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
didn’t
intend
to
give
it
up
but
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes.
what
we
were
trying
to
do
here
was
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
entanglement
theory
because
i
believe
both
of
walz
case
and
the
tilton
case
have
been
decided
since
this
complaint
was
drawn
and
presented
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
it’s
chartered
to
operate
a
baptist
liberal
arts
college.
its
trustees
reported
by
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention.
it
operates
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
it
has
an
open
admissions
policy.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
neither
its
students
nor
its
faculty
eliminated
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
don’t
think
they’re
require
to
take
any
course
and
merely
offer
a
baptist
offering
but
i
know
this
that
when
i
believe
that
counsel
in
this
case
were
arguing
at
one
time
that
it
wasn’t
a
baptist
activity
and
i
think
there’s
a
certain
baptist,
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention
called
them
on
the
cop,
didn’t
he?[laughter]
and
told
them
he
was.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
the
circuit
judge
said
it
was
at
least
in
part
a
function
of
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
they
give
them
capital
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
the
baptist
thinks
that
it’s
a
religious
activity
of
theirs.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
it’s
evident.
this
institution
is
an
activity
of
the
baptist
of
the
south
carolina
and
i
believe
that
they
think,
regardless
of
this
application
for
assistance
that
governmental
interference
with
what
they’re
doing
here
would
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
they
think
that
this
is
a
religious
activity.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
it
wouldn’t
bind
the
court
but
at
some
evidence
of
what
they
think
they’re
doing
is
some
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
because
it
was
created
to
include
in
its
curriculum
from
religious
courses
and
offerings
and
instruction
in
preparation
to
be
a
baptist
preacher.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
what
they
think
as
the
baptist
approach
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right.
they
have
courses
that
lead
up
to
being
a
baptist
minister.
now,
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
they
do,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
i
said,
they
give
courses.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
i’m
not
--
this
is
a
fairly
new
educational
institution,
isn’t
it
and
it
hasn’t
yet
developed
to
the
point
that
i
think
the
baptist
intended
it
to
develop.
now,
this
is,
this
--[laughter]
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
the
board
of
trustees
here
is
named
by
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention.
now,
they
don’t
have
to
be
baptist
but
they
are
appointed.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
they
are
appointed.
the
whole
board
and
the
operator
they
entrust
for
the
south
carolina
baptist
convention.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
and
when
they
got
the
charter,
they
wrote
in
there
to
operate
a
baptist
liberal
arts
charter.
now,
they
are
in
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
it
does,
mr.
justice.
the
only
other
observation
i
want
to
make
was
that.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
if
they
haven’t
done
it?
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
no,
i
don’t
think.
i
think
they
could
contribute
to
it.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
to
me,
it’s
because
they
think
it
is.[laughter]
and
i
take
that
as
evidence
that
they’ve
accomplished
what
they
should
--
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
well,
that’s
all.
that’s
all
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
yes,
the
naming
of
the
board
of
trustees.
mr.
robert
mccormick
figg,
jr.
that’s
right.
