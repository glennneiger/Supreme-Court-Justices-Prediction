mr.
huger
sinkler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
certainly
hope
that
the
appellant
here
is
regarded
as
having
standing
because
this
case
does
have
some
significance
not
only
in
south
carolina
but
throughout
the
united
states
(inaudible).
this
type
of
statute,
this
particular
statute
was
adopted
from
the
massachusetts
statute.
you
have
similar
statutes
in
new
jersey
which
yesterday
filed
amicus
brief
relating
this
case
which
i
hope
your
honors
will
entertain.
there
are
similar
statutes
in
ohio
that
i
know
of
because
i
have
correspondents
with
the
bond
counsel
out
there
and
quite
a
number
of
bonds
had
been
issued
in
the
state
of
new
york.
we
were
lucky
enough
to
have
somehow
rather
foreseen
or
from
the
trend,
the
dissents
perhaps
in
what
might
happen
in
tilton,
in
lemon
and
dicenso,
so
when
we
started
this
case
in
1970,
we
raised
this
first
amendment,
had
the
question
raised.
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
because
as
bond
counsel
it’s
our
duty
to
see
that
all
possible
questions
involving
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
could,
were
properly
presented
and
disposed
of
before
people
would
be
invited
to
buy
bonds
based
on
the
statute.
the
statute
had
serious
implications.
mr.
huger
sinkler
this
is
adversary
litigation
of
the
tested
variety
which
is
quite
frequent
in
all
courts,
state
courts
to
determine
question
of
constitutionality
of
statutes.
and
we
felt
that
this
did
raise
serious
questions.
they
have
been
countless
millions
of
dollars
of
bonds
sold
in
this
particular
area.
none
can
be
sold
now
as
a
consequence
of
the
pendency
of
this
litigation
while
it’s
not
particularly
significant
to
the
baptist
college
because
this
litigation
lasted
so
long
they
came
along
and
financed
most
of
their
--
got
most
of
their
or
most
of
their
problems
with
the
private
loan
is
still
have
an
application
before
the
board.
it’s
important
to
the
27
colleges
that
other
colleges
in
south
carolina
which
need
this
type
of
help.
mr.
huger
sinkler
in
this
particular
case,
we’ve
been
associated.
we
actually
originally
implied
that
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
representing
with
--
at
the
request
of
the
attorney
general,
yes
with
his
permission
at
his
request.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
stay
in
the
position
of
the
state,
yes
and
urging
you
to
hear
and
decide
the
case
in
favor
of
the
state.
now,
to
get
to
the
merits,
i’d
like
to
go
back
a
bit
and
explain
the
nature
of
this
transaction
because
it
is
not
the
ordinary
self-liquidating
type
of
revenue
bond
that
really
gained
this
(inaudible)
in
the
30’s
at
the
time
when
my
friend
and
i
served
in
the
south
carolina
together
and
had
a
lot
of
those
statutes.
this
is
comparable
to
the
normal
industrial
development
revenue
bond
which
have
been
going
on
and
i
think
gained
their
sentences
in
the
60’s.
what
happens
here
is
this.
the
authority
takes
title.
it
makes
this
lease
with
the
college.
in
this
lease,
it
sets
up
the
covenants
which
the
colleges
got
to
perform.
it
then
mortgages
the
project
to
a
trustee
bank
and
at
the
same
time,
assigns
to
that
trustee
bank
its
rights
under
the
lease.
so
that
actually,
the
state
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
conduit.
now,
the
statute
spells
out
what
the
state
could
do.
but
actually,
once
this
contract
is
made,
the
state
steps
aside,
the
trustee
bank
takes
over.
just
as
in
the
case
of
all
industrial
development
bonds.
so
that
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
bondholder
looks
to
the
trustee
to
enforce
his
rights
not
to
the
state.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
it
may
be
deemed
to
be
an
agent
of
the
state
in
the
sense
that
it
is
exercising.
but
it’s
actually
really
acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
i
think
the
trustee
in
one
sense
an
agent
but
it’s
an
agent
not
at
that
stage
for
the
state.
it’s
an
agent
for
the
bondholders
which
it
represents.
that’s
its
primary
duty.
because
the
trustee
bank
receives
the
money,
pays
it
out
and
under
the
indenture
enforces
the
rights
and
remedies
of
the
bondholders.
and
that’s
the
way
that’s
frankly,
a
routine
type
of
financing
in
the
industrial
revenue
bond
field
and
in
this
college
type
of
field.
mr.
huger
sinkler
it
--
i
don’t
think
it
contains.
it
does
not
contain
the
trust
instrument
but
what
it
does
contain
are
rules
and
regulations
that
the
state
board
adopted
following
tilton.
and
in
those
regulations,
it
prescribes
that
there
shall
be
a
lease
and
it
prescribes
that
there
shall
be
an
indenture,
a
trust
indenture.
i
think
you’ll
find
those
on
--
beginning
on
page
47
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
are
the
regulations
relating
to
the
functioning
of
the
authority
which
spell
out
just
exactly
what
takes
place.
so
that,
as
i
see
it
in
the,
in
tilton,
there
was
an
outright
grant
of
money
but
there
was
also
the
covenant
not
to
violate
the
religious
that
make
use
of
the
property
for
religious
purposes.
we
have
to
do
that
in
a
slightly
different
way
because
we’re
not
granting
money
and
we
can’t
make
the
institution
pay
us
back.
we’ve
given
them
nothing,
there’s
nothing
to
take
back.
so,
what
we
do
is
to
subject
that
property
to
our
covenant
that
will
not
be
use
and
so
long
as
the
institutional,
any
voluntary
grantee
of
that
institution
on
this
property
it
can’t
use
it
for
religious
purposes.
now,
that
part
of
the,
our
regulations
and
the
holding
of
grant
holding
in
tilton
seem
to
me
to
be
identical.
the
only
difference
here
is
that
we’re
not
granting
money.
we
are
really
taking
an
advantage
of
a
provision
in
the
internal
revenue
code
to
give
these
people
tax
exempt
but
that’s
actually
rather
significant.
a
million
dollar
saved
at
least
two
percent.
well,
this
college
actually
refinanced
most
of
its
--
the
money
that
originally
wanted
to
get
because
the
application
is
now
cut
down
from
and
we
noted
that
to
the
court
for
about
$3.5
million
to
about
$1
billion.
mr.
huger
sinkler
not
in
south
carolina,
no
sir.
mr.
huger
sinkler
this
is
absolutely
the
first.
but
they
happened
elsewhere.
they
happened
elsewhere
so
that
--
and
i
think
the
fact
that
in
new
jersey,
some
reason
or
other,
their
litigation
stopped
under
amend
didn’t
come
back
up.
i
think
there
are
really
just
twin
cases,
so
they
filed
a
--
the
petitioner
filed
an
amicus
yesterday
which
i
hope
you
all
would
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
not
ohio
but
some
of
the
people
in
squire
there’s
out
there
had
talked
to
me
about
the
fact
that
(voice
overlap).
i
think
that
you
may,
i
don’t
know
whether
there’s
ohio
case
testing
the
validity
of
the
statute
or
not.
i
really
don’t
know
that.
i
should
know
the
answer
to
that
now
but
sorry
i
don’t.
but
you
might
look
because
i’m
sure
that
there
have
been
bonds
issued
in
ohio.
new
york,
that
i
know
of.
massachusetts,
i’m
practically
certain
in.
i
think,
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes,
you
set,
you
treated
south
carolina
and
new
jersey
are
exactly
alike.
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes,
it’s
the
same
as
south
carolina
did
but
the
same
effect.
their
statute,
they
say
they
vary
their
procedures
if
you’ll
notice
their
amicus
brief,
they
use
and
then
maybe
a
little
better,
frankly.
it
might
be
a
little
less
entangling.
i
think
it’s
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
we
use
this
lease
and
you’ll
assign
the
rights
of
the
lease
to
the
trustee
bank
and
you
take
it
over
there.
in
new
jersey,
they
use
a
loan
agreement
approach
which
we
have
used
in
other
types
of
financing
in
south
carolina
but
not
in
this.
but
this
is
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
i
think,
actually,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
hope
i
understand
it,
he
simply
alleges
that
the
machinery
or
device
at
which
we
have
employed,
this
is
the
lease
in
the
state
agency
which
has
these
powers
which
are
all
translated
into
the
lease
agreement.
he
claims
that
involves
entanglement
which
is
forbidden
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
huger
sinkler
get
very
narrowly,
i
think
your
honor,
i
would
simply
say
that
i
don’t
see
anything
wrong
with
the
thing
except
the
fact
that
he
might,
you
might
want
to
say
that
the
state
board
could
not
do
these
things
but
i
think
the
state
board
ought
to
be
allowed
to
supervise
a
lease
agreement
which
would
contain
all
these
premises.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
he
doesn’t
think
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
it’s
his
basic
position.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
was,
it
pressed
me
that
way
your
honor,
that
it
use
that
way.
mr.
huger
sinkler
question
of
what?
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
the
state’s
credit
is
not
as
lend
especially
in
effect.
all
the
states
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
oh,
lending
the
state
--
the
fact
that
the
state
is
the
borrower
and
not
the
college
amounts
to
about,
is
worth
at
least
two
percent
per
million
dollars
a
year.
mr.
huger
sinkler
surely,
it’s
a
substantial
benefit.
(voice
overlap)
$20,000
of
20
years
is
$400,000.
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes.
mr.
huger
sinkler
oh,
as
to
the
state
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
statute
doesn’t
get
involved
in
state
constitutional
grounds,
i
would
assume
that
if
there’s
no
entanglement
or
first
amendment
question,
we
could
go
right
along
with
it.
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
aid
feature
is
getting
back
to
the
action
of
the
court
in
wilson
against
essex
--
that’s
sort
of
the
wolman
against
essex;
it
was
to
the
ohio
case.
well,
i
think
there,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
first
and
second
premises
which
you
examined
these
statutes
under.
mr.
huger
sinkler
of
course,
i
do.
the
--
i
gather
that
the
thrust
in
this
attack
was
sufficient
to
bring
the
whole
first
amendment
into
play
and
that
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
it
certainly
was
raised.
i
think
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
precisely
sir.
precisely.
let
me
see
if
i
could
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
they
said
that
the
action
taken
was
not
violative
of
first
amendment.
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes,
you
hear
that
all
of
the
questions.
he
brought
it
all
here,
but
i
think
he
laid
special
emphasis
on
the
fact.certainly,
the
object
to
the
statute
is
a
secular
one
because
of
its
purposes
to
help
the
individual
throughout
the
state.
it’s
not
to
help
the
individual.
and
even
in
wolman
against
essex
where
the
ohio
statute
was
giving
money
to
the
parents
of
children
who
went
to
parochial
schools.
the
district
--
the
three-judge
court
which
you
all
approve,
upheld
recently
held
that
that
object
was
perfectly
valid
secular
one.
and
then
the
question
of
whether
it’s
principal
or
primary
effect
advance
or
inhibit
the
schools
down
that
i
suppose,
they
are
more
religious
schools
in
the
colleges.
i
think
more.
i
think
the
actual
breakdown,
if
you’re
interested
are.
there
are
19
four-year
colleges
of
which
12
have
baptist
episcopal
or
something.
mr.
huger
sinkler
no.
mr.
huger
sinkler
not
a
single
bond
has
been
issued
under
this
sir.
we’ve
been
litigating
for
three
years.[laughter]
mr.
huger
sinkler
that’s
correct
sir,
they
do
get
--
the
state
does
get
the
benefit
of
having,
not
to
have
to
build
additional
four-year
schools.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
i
think
that’s
the
emphasis
of
his
argument.
so,
i
think
perhaps
he
suggested
that
the
whole
things
is
bad
anywhere
under
the
first
amendment
but
i
think
the
first
amendment
question
to
ask,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
if
you,
the
supreme
court
decision
is
in
one
of
these
things,
i
guess
it’s
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
last
time
it
went
back
to
the
court,
they
very
carefully.
i
think
that
decisions
begin
on
about
page
15
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
they
specifically
pass
on
these
three
questions.
i
don’t
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
substance
and
not
the
form
of
this
transaction,
you
will
see
that
it’s
the
state
is
simply,
they
can’t
view
it
and
the
aid
that
they
are
giving
is
to
because
those
bonds
will
be
in
the
state
of
south
carolina,
they
will
have
the
tax
exempt
status
permitted
under
the
irs
section
103.
and
as
a
consequence,
save
these
institutions
substantial
sums
of
money.
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
trustee
would
do
it.
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
state
would
presumably
be
a
party
and
presumably
would
join
in
the
prayer
of
the
trustee.
i’m
sure
that
the
state
would
want
to
see
the
--
would
not
want
to
see
any
bonds
issued.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
industrial
development
bonds
which
are
really
industrial
bonds
out
in
the
state.
our
state,
same
body
reviews
the
financial
standings,
the
figures
of
those
companies
before
they
approve
bonds.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
the
trustee
would
do
it.
the
trustee
--
in
other
words,
the
rights
of
the
state
under
the
lease
agreement
which
is
a
document
which
prescribes
that
rates
and
charges
shall
be
sufficient
to
pay
when
due
principal,
interest,
redemption
fee,
if
any.
they
are
assigned
to
the
trustee,
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
industrial
development
bonds.
all
one
transaction,
all
happens
at
the
same
time.
first
of
all,
make
you
conveyance.
you
next
make
your
lease.
you
make
your
trust
indenture,
the
trust
indenture
not
only
mortgages
the
property
itself
but
has
an
assignment
in
it
of
the
leaseholder’s
states
so
that
the
trustee
at
that
time
takes
on,
takes
over
everything,
the
state
stands
aside
and
the
state
has
been
in
the
transaction
for
the
course
of
few
hours
at
best
because
all
of
these
things
are
in
theory
done
simultaneously
as
your
honor
knows.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
i
think
the
--
i
don’t
think
the
statute
says
that
i
think
mr.
figg
was
arguing
that
the
statute
meant
that
the
authority
had
to
do
that.
i
don’t
think
the
authority
has
to
do
that
as
a
practical
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
maybe
i
misunderstood
it.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
oh,
as
a
parallel
of
the
acts,
it
simply
says
that
the
authority
may
exercise
all
its
powers.
as
i
--
those
are
not,
it’s
not
mandatory
on
the
authority
to
do
that.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
authority
would
do
that
through
the
lease.
but
as
i
say,
the
lease
is
assigned
to
the
trustees,
so
that
it
steps
out.
but
actually,
this
entanglement
is
actually
what
would
happen,
would
be
that
whoever
the
bondholder
himself
or
the
trustee
for
the
bondholders,
is
willing
to
act
would
go
to
court
and
ask
that
the
covenants
be
enforced.
all
that
the
mortgage
be
foreclosed
because
as
i
pointed
out
in
this
particular
support.
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
act
doesn’t
say,
you
shall
do
that.
the
act
simply
says,
if
you
please,
your
honor
that
those
are
all
powers
if
maybe
availed
of.

i
think
you
go
back
to
page
39
--
39
says,
the
authority
may.
then
the
resolution,
you
talk
about
the
resolution
which
of
course
is
also
one
of
the
working
papers
at
the
time
of
the
transaction.
it’s
term
to
set
out
on
page
39
as
to
what
it
can
do
and
what
it
can’t
do.
but
actually,
you
could
strike
section
11
out
of
the,
this
paragraph
11
out
of
the
act
and
not
of
heard
anything
as
i
see.
because
if
we
do
it
all
in
the
lease,
on
your
resolutions.
mr.
huger
sinkler
that’s
just
the
strict,
regular
mortgage
foreclosure.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
no.
the
act
says
this
neither
the
school
nor
any
voluntary
transferee
may
do
this.
now,
you
say,
the
college
is
for
--
lets
the
mortgage
get
foreclosed
with
the
idea
that
it
will
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
then
it
will
get
some
third
party
to
buy
it
then
sell
it
back.
mr.
huger
sinkler
that
would
be
collusion
that
the
courts
could
upset.
i
mean,
that’s
the
collusive
transaction.
you
couldn’t
premise
a
decision
here
on
this
field.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
that’s
right
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
that’s
a
pretty
far
fetch.
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes,
that’s
the
argument
made
in
the
brief.
that’s
a
point
but
we
have
to
have
the
foreclosable
mortgage
to
be
able
to
sell
bonds
from
a
practical
standpoint.
that’s
the
reason
that
was
put
in
there
with
that
recognition.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
that’s
so
remote
and
actually
if
the
college
where
they
have
most
the
property
now,
people
could
use
it
for
anything.
but
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
and
i
suppose
it’s
a
bad
way
to
patent
statutes
on
particular
cases
but
this
was
just
the
college
was
really
in
financial
trouble
when
this
thing
started.
it’s
fortunately
not
in
it
now.
it
had
a
very
valuable
tract
of
land
that
would
be
security
and
they
wanted
to
--
they
wanted
to
authorize
and
you
have
to
pull
up
that
and
that
was
one
of
the
things.
so,
this
foreclosable
mortgage
with
three
of
the
covenant
really
is
security
to
the
guy
who
buys
the
bond.
thank
you.
mr.
huger
sinkler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
certainly
hope
that
the
appellant
here
is
regarded
as
having
standing
because
this
case
does
have
some
significance
not
only
in
south
carolina
but
throughout
the
united
states
(inaudible).
this
type
of
statute,
this
particular
statute
was
adopted
from
the
massachusetts
statute.
you
have
similar
statutes
in
new
jersey
which
yesterday
filed
amicus
brief
relating
this
case
which
i
hope
your
honors
will
entertain.
there
are
similar
statutes
in
ohio
that
i
know
of
because
i
have
correspondents
with
the
bond
counsel
out
there
and
quite
a
number
of
bonds
had
been
issued
in
the
state
of
new
york.
we
were
lucky
enough
to
have
somehow
rather
foreseen
or
from
the
trend,
the
dissents
perhaps
in
what
might
happen
in
tilton,
in
lemon
and
dicenso,
so
when
we
started
this
case
in
1970,
we
raised
this
first
amendment,
had
the
question
raised.
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
because
as
bond
counsel
it’s
our
duty
to
see
that
all
possible
questions
involving
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
could,
were
properly
presented
and
disposed
of
before
people
would
be
invited
to
buy
bonds
based
on
the
statute.
the
statute
had
serious
implications.
mr.
huger
sinkler
this
is
adversary
litigation
of
the
tested
variety
which
is
quite
frequent
in
all
courts,
state
courts
to
determine
question
of
constitutionality
of
statutes.
and
we
felt
that
this
did
raise
serious
questions.
they
have
been
countless
millions
of
dollars
of
bonds
sold
in
this
particular
area.
none
can
be
sold
now
as
a
consequence
of
the
pendency
of
this
litigation
while
it’s
not
particularly
significant
to
the
baptist
college
because
this
litigation
lasted
so
long
they
came
along
and
financed
most
of
their
--
got
most
of
their
or
most
of
their
problems
with
the
private
loan
is
still
have
an
application
before
the
board.
it’s
important
to
the
27
colleges
that
other
colleges
in
south
carolina
which
need
this
type
of
help.
mr.
huger
sinkler
in
this
particular
case,
we’ve
been
associated.
we
actually
originally
implied
that
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
representing
with
--
at
the
request
of
the
attorney
general,
yes
with
his
permission
at
his
request.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
stay
in
the
position
of
the
state,
yes
and
urging
you
to
hear
and
decide
the
case
in
favor
of
the
state.
now,
to
get
to
the
merits,
i’d
like
to
go
back
a
bit
and
explain
the
nature
of
this
transaction
because
it
is
not
the
ordinary
self-liquidating
type
of
revenue
bond
that
really
gained
this
(inaudible)
in
the
30’s
at
the
time
when
my
friend
and
i
served
in
the
south
carolina
together
and
had
a
lot
of
those
statutes.
this
is
comparable
to
the
normal
industrial
development
revenue
bond
which
have
been
going
on
and
i
think
gained
their
sentences
in
the
60’s.
what
happens
here
is
this.
the
authority
takes
title.
it
makes
this
lease
with
the
college.
in
this
lease,
it
sets
up
the
covenants
which
the
colleges
got
to
perform.
it
then
mortgages
the
project
to
a
trustee
bank
and
at
the
same
time,
assigns
to
that
trustee
bank
its
rights
under
the
lease.
so
that
actually,
the
state
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
conduit.
now,
the
statute
spells
out
what
the
state
could
do.
but
actually,
once
this
contract
is
made,
the
state
steps
aside,
the
trustee
bank
takes
over.
just
as
in
the
case
of
all
industrial
development
bonds.
so
that
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
bondholder
looks
to
the
trustee
to
enforce
his
rights
not
to
the
state.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
it
may
be
deemed
to
be
an
agent
of
the
state
in
the
sense
that
it
is
exercising.
but
it’s
actually
really
acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
i
think
the
trustee
in
one
sense
an
agent
but
it’s
an
agent
not
at
that
stage
for
the
state.
it’s
an
agent
for
the
bondholders
which
it
represents.
that’s
its
primary
duty.
because
the
trustee
bank
receives
the
money,
pays
it
out
and
under
the
indenture
enforces
the
rights
and
remedies
of
the
bondholders.
and
that’s
the
way
that’s
frankly,
a
routine
type
of
financing
in
the
industrial
revenue
bond
field
and
in
this
college
type
of
field.
mr.
huger
sinkler
it
--
i
don’t
think
it
contains.
it
does
not
contain
the
trust
instrument
but
what
it
does
contain
are
rules
and
regulations
that
the
state
board
adopted
following
tilton.
and
in
those
regulations,
it
prescribes
that
there
shall
be
a
lease
and
it
prescribes
that
there
shall
be
an
indenture,
a
trust
indenture.
i
think
you’ll
find
those
on
--
beginning
on
page
47
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
are
the
regulations
relating
to
the
functioning
of
the
authority
which
spell
out
just
exactly
what
takes
place.
so
that,
as
i
see
it
in
the,
in
tilton,
there
was
an
outright
grant
of
money
but
there
was
also
the
covenant
not
to
violate
the
religious
that
make
use
of
the
property
for
religious
purposes.
we
have
to
do
that
in
a
slightly
different
way
because
we’re
not
granting
money
and
we
can’t
make
the
institution
pay
us
back.
we’ve
given
them
nothing,
there’s
nothing
to
take
back.
so,
what
we
do
is
to
subject
that
property
to
our
covenant
that
will
not
be
use
and
so
long
as
the
institutional,
any
voluntary
grantee
of
that
institution
on
this
property
it
can’t
use
it
for
religious
purposes.
now,
that
part
of
the,
our
regulations
and
the
holding
of
grant
holding
in
tilton
seem
to
me
to
be
identical.
the
only
difference
here
is
that
we’re
not
granting
money.
we
are
really
taking
an
advantage
of
a
provision
in
the
internal
revenue
code
to
give
these
people
tax
exempt
but
that’s
actually
rather
significant.
a
million
dollar
saved
at
least
two
percent.
well,
this
college
actually
refinanced
most
of
its
--
the
money
that
originally
wanted
to
get
because
the
application
is
now
cut
down
from
and
we
noted
that
to
the
court
for
about
$3.5
million
to
about
$1
billion.
mr.
huger
sinkler
not
in
south
carolina,
no
sir.
mr.
huger
sinkler
this
is
absolutely
the
first.
but
they
happened
elsewhere.
they
happened
elsewhere
so
that
--
and
i
think
the
fact
that
in
new
jersey,
some
reason
or
other,
their
litigation
stopped
under
amend
didn’t
come
back
up.
i
think
there
are
really
just
twin
cases,
so
they
filed
a
--
the
petitioner
filed
an
amicus
yesterday
which
i
hope
you
all
would
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
not
ohio
but
some
of
the
people
in
squire
there’s
out
there
had
talked
to
me
about
the
fact
that
(voice
overlap).
i
think
that
you
may,
i
don’t
know
whether
there’s
ohio
case
testing
the
validity
of
the
statute
or
not.
i
really
don’t
know
that.
i
should
know
the
answer
to
that
now
but
sorry
i
don’t.
but
you
might
look
because
i’m
sure
that
there
have
been
bonds
issued
in
ohio.
new
york,
that
i
know
of.
massachusetts,
i’m
practically
certain
in.
i
think,
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes,
you
set,
you
treated
south
carolina
and
new
jersey
are
exactly
alike.
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes,
it’s
the
same
as
south
carolina
did
but
the
same
effect.
their
statute,
they
say
they
vary
their
procedures
if
you’ll
notice
their
amicus
brief,
they
use
and
then
maybe
a
little
better,
frankly.
it
might
be
a
little
less
entangling.
i
think
it’s
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
we
use
this
lease
and
you’ll
assign
the
rights
of
the
lease
to
the
trustee
bank
and
you
take
it
over
there.
in
new
jersey,
they
use
a
loan
agreement
approach
which
we
have
used
in
other
types
of
financing
in
south
carolina
but
not
in
this.
but
this
is
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
i
think,
actually,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
hope
i
understand
it,
he
simply
alleges
that
the
machinery
or
device
at
which
we
have
employed,
this
is
the
lease
in
the
state
agency
which
has
these
powers
which
are
all
translated
into
the
lease
agreement.
he
claims
that
involves
entanglement
which
is
forbidden
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
huger
sinkler
get
very
narrowly,
i
think
your
honor,
i
would
simply
say
that
i
don’t
see
anything
wrong
with
the
thing
except
the
fact
that
he
might,
you
might
want
to
say
that
the
state
board
could
not
do
these
things
but
i
think
the
state
board
ought
to
be
allowed
to
supervise
a
lease
agreement
which
would
contain
all
these
premises.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
he
doesn’t
think
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
it’s
his
basic
position.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
was,
it
pressed
me
that
way
your
honor,
that
it
use
that
way.
mr.
huger
sinkler
question
of
what?
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
the
state’s
credit
is
not
as
lend
especially
in
effect.
all
the
states
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
oh,
lending
the
state
--
the
fact
that
the
state
is
the
borrower
and
not
the
college
amounts
to
about,
is
worth
at
least
two
percent
per
million
dollars
a
year.
mr.
huger
sinkler
surely,
it’s
a
substantial
benefit.
(voice
overlap)
$20,000
of
20
years
is
$400,000.
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes.
mr.
huger
sinkler
oh,
as
to
the
state
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
statute
doesn’t
get
involved
in
state
constitutional
grounds,
i
would
assume
that
if
there’s
no
entanglement
or
first
amendment
question,
we
could
go
right
along
with
it.
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
aid
feature
is
getting
back
to
the
action
of
the
court
in
wilson
against
essex
--
that’s
sort
of
the
wolman
against
essex;
it
was
to
the
ohio
case.
well,
i
think
there,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
first
and
second
premises
which
you
examined
these
statutes
under.
mr.
huger
sinkler
of
course,
i
do.
the
--
i
gather
that
the
thrust
in
this
attack
was
sufficient
to
bring
the
whole
first
amendment
into
play
and
that
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
it
certainly
was
raised.
i
think
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
precisely
sir.
precisely.
let
me
see
if
i
could
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
they
said
that
the
action
taken
was
not
violative
of
first
amendment.
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes,
you
hear
that
all
of
the
questions.
he
brought
it
all
here,
but
i
think
he
laid
special
emphasis
on
the
fact.certainly,
the
object
to
the
statute
is
a
secular
one
because
of
its
purposes
to
help
the
individual
throughout
the
state.
it’s
not
to
help
the
individual.
and
even
in
wolman
against
essex
where
the
ohio
statute
was
giving
money
to
the
parents
of
children
who
went
to
parochial
schools.
the
district
--
the
three-judge
court
which
you
all
approve,
upheld
recently
held
that
that
object
was
perfectly
valid
secular
one.
and
then
the
question
of
whether
it’s
principal
or
primary
effect
advance
or
inhibit
the
schools
down
that
i
suppose,
they
are
more
religious
schools
in
the
colleges.
i
think
more.
i
think
the
actual
breakdown,
if
you’re
interested
are.
there
are
19
four-year
colleges
of
which
12
have
baptist
episcopal
or
something.
mr.
huger
sinkler
no.
mr.
huger
sinkler
not
a
single
bond
has
been
issued
under
this
sir.
we’ve
been
litigating
for
three
years.[laughter]
mr.
huger
sinkler
that’s
correct
sir,
they
do
get
--
the
state
does
get
the
benefit
of
having,
not
to
have
to
build
additional
four-year
schools.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
i
think
that’s
the
emphasis
of
his
argument.
so,
i
think
perhaps
he
suggested
that
the
whole
things
is
bad
anywhere
under
the
first
amendment
but
i
think
the
first
amendment
question
to
ask,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
if
you,
the
supreme
court
decision
is
in
one
of
these
things,
i
guess
it’s
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
last
time
it
went
back
to
the
court,
they
very
carefully.
i
think
that
decisions
begin
on
about
page
15
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
they
specifically
pass
on
these
three
questions.
i
don’t
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
substance
and
not
the
form
of
this
transaction,
you
will
see
that
it’s
the
state
is
simply,
they
can’t
view
it
and
the
aid
that
they
are
giving
is
to
because
those
bonds
will
be
in
the
state
of
south
carolina,
they
will
have
the
tax
exempt
status
permitted
under
the
irs
section
103.
and
as
a
consequence,
save
these
institutions
substantial
sums
of
money.
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
trustee
would
do
it.
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
state
would
presumably
be
a
party
and
presumably
would
join
in
the
prayer
of
the
trustee.
i’m
sure
that
the
state
would
want
to
see
the
--
would
not
want
to
see
any
bonds
issued.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
industrial
development
bonds
which
are
really
industrial
bonds
out
in
the
state.
our
state,
same
body
reviews
the
financial
standings,
the
figures
of
those
companies
before
they
approve
bonds.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
the
trustee
would
do
it.
the
trustee
--
in
other
words,
the
rights
of
the
state
under
the
lease
agreement
which
is
a
document
which
prescribes
that
rates
and
charges
shall
be
sufficient
to
pay
when
due
principal,
interest,
redemption
fee,
if
any.
they
are
assigned
to
the
trustee,
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
industrial
development
bonds.
all
one
transaction,
all
happens
at
the
same
time.
first
of
all,
make
you
conveyance.
you
next
make
your
lease.
you
make
your
trust
indenture,
the
trust
indenture
not
only
mortgages
the
property
itself
but
has
an
assignment
in
it
of
the
leaseholder’s
states
so
that
the
trustee
at
that
time
takes
on,
takes
over
everything,
the
state
stands
aside
and
the
state
has
been
in
the
transaction
for
the
course
of
few
hours
at
best
because
all
of
these
things
are
in
theory
done
simultaneously
as
your
honor
knows.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
i
think
the
--
i
don’t
think
the
statute
says
that
i
think
mr.
figg
was
arguing
that
the
statute
meant
that
the
authority
had
to
do
that.
i
don’t
think
the
authority
has
to
do
that
as
a
practical
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
maybe
i
misunderstood
it.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
oh,
as
a
parallel
of
the
acts,
it
simply
says
that
the
authority
may
exercise
all
its
powers.
as
i
--
those
are
not,
it’s
not
mandatory
on
the
authority
to
do
that.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
authority
would
do
that
through
the
lease.
but
as
i
say,
the
lease
is
assigned
to
the
trustees,
so
that
it
steps
out.
but
actually,
this
entanglement
is
actually
what
would
happen,
would
be
that
whoever
the
bondholder
himself
or
the
trustee
for
the
bondholders,
is
willing
to
act
would
go
to
court
and
ask
that
the
covenants
be
enforced.
all
that
the
mortgage
be
foreclosed
because
as
i
pointed
out
in
this
particular
support.
mr.
huger
sinkler
the
act
doesn’t
say,
you
shall
do
that.
the
act
simply
says,
if
you
please,
your
honor
that
those
are
all
powers
if
maybe
availed
of.
page
--
i
think
you
go
back
to
page
39
--
39
says,
the
authority
may.
then
the
resolution,
you
talk
about
the
resolution
which
of
course
is
also
one
of
the
working
papers
at
the
time
of
the
transaction.
it’s
term
to
set
out
on
page
39
as
to
what
it
can
do
and
what
it
can’t
do.
but
actually,
you
could
strike
section
11
out
of
the,
this
paragraph
11
out
of
the
act
and
not
of
heard
anything
as
i
see.
because
if
we
do
it
all
in
the
lease,
on
your
resolutions.
mr.
huger
sinkler
that’s
just
the
strict,
regular
mortgage
foreclosure.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
no.
the
act
says
this
neither
the
school
nor
any
voluntary
transferee
may
do
this.
now,
you
say,
the
college
is
for
--
lets
the
mortgage
get
foreclosed
with
the
idea
that
it
will
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
then
it
will
get
some
third
party
to
buy
it
then
sell
it
back.
mr.
huger
sinkler
that
would
be
collusion
that
the
courts
could
upset.
i
mean,
that’s
the
collusive
transaction.
you
couldn’t
premise
a
decision
here
on
this
field.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
that’s
right
--
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
that’s
a
pretty
far
fetch.
mr.
huger
sinkler
yes,
that’s
the
argument
made
in
the
brief.
that’s
a
point
but
we
have
to
have
the
foreclosable
mortgage
to
be
able
to
sell
bonds
from
a
practical
standpoint.
that’s
the
reason
that
was
put
in
there
with
that
recognition.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
that’s
so
remote
and
actually
if
the
college
where
they
have
most
the
property
now,
people
could
use
it
for
anything.
but
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
and
i
suppose
it’s
a
bad
way
to
patent
statutes
on
particular
cases
but
this
was
just
the
college
was
really
in
financial
trouble
when
this
thing
started.
it’s
fortunately
not
in
it
now.
it
had
a
very
valuable
tract
of
land
that
would
be
security
and
they
wanted
to
--
they
wanted
to
authorize
and
you
have
to
pull
up
that
and
that
was
one
of
the
things.
so,
this
foreclosable
mortgage
with
three
of
the
covenant
really
is
security
to
the
guy
who
buys
the
bond.
thank
you.
