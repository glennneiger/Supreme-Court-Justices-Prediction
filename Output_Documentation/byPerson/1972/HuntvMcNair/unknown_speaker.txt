unknown
speaker
how
about
the
cost,
mr.
figg,
may
they
also
cut
the
expenses
in
order
to
be
shared
in
net
rentals?
unknown
speaker
you
know
there’s
aid
--
there’s
the
aid
been
given?
this
isn’t
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
are
you
employed
by
the
state?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
representing
the
government?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
--
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
so,
that
you’re
stating
now
that
the
--
unknown
speaker
then
you’re
saying
that
the
trustee
bank
cannot
be
an
agent
of
the
state
in
any
way.
unknown
speaker
this
record
contains
no
trust
instrument
of
any
kind?
unknown
speaker
would
the
trustee
or
the
state
go
to
the
college
and
say,
“look,
you
must
raise
your
fees
and
tuitions
--”
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
act
that’s
before
us.
the
act
does
put
--
unknown
speaker
then
if
there’s
a
default
foreclosure
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
then
the,
then
the
school
can
be
or
can
be
operated
as
a
religious
school
or
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
that’s
an
involuntary
transferee.
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
point
me
and
your
brother
figg
--
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
say,
we’re
not
collusive.
let’s
where
there
are
non-collusive
buyer
that
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
then
operate
--
this
is
a
religious
(voice
overlap)
--organization
which
in
the
mean
time
has
had
all
the
state
support.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
the
argument
made
in
the
brief
of
your
brother?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn’t
really
answer
the
--
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me
what
makes
this
college
involve
here
questionable
under
the
first
amendment?
you
said
it’s
a
baptist
college,
what
makes
it
a
baptist
college?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
an
open
admissions
policy?
unknown
speaker
are
all
of
its
faculty
baptist?
unknown
speaker
then
it’s
not
required
to
take
any
course
in
religion
if
he
doesn’t
want
to?
unknown
speaker
was
somebody
at
some
sort,
at
some
sort
of
this,
in
this
case
decided
that
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
the
pay
goes
to
the
money.
the
baptist
convention
gives
this
money.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
make
it
a
--
does
that
make
it
a
baptist,
a
sectarian
institution
in
the
sense
the
aid
to
it
will
support
religion?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
care
what?
how
about
under
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
they
would
bind
the
court
or
--?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
think
makes
it
a
suspect
under
the
first
amendment?
the
connection
between
this
institution
and
the
baptist
church
what
in
practical
thing
makes
it
a
suspect
in
your
mind?
unknown
speaker
alright.
so,
they
do
--
they
do
have
it.
they
do
teach
religion
their
baptist,
the
baptist
faith.
unknown
speaker
it’s
to
produce
baptist
ministry?
unknown
speaker
mr.
figg,
they
don’t
give
degrees
in
divinity
at
this
college,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
they
don’t?
i
thought
you
said
they
just
did.
unknown
speaker
they
give
courses
but
they
get
ministers
out
of
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
figg,
let
me
take
another
approach.
some
of
these
schools
have
requirements
that
the
board
or
the
percentage
of
it
be
members
of
the
denomination.
is
that
true
here?
does
the
record
disclose
this?
unknown
speaker
they
are
named
under
the
convention.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
this
sense
is
in
part
of
justice
white’s
inquiry
then?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
what
degrees
are
offered
at
this
college?
unknown
speaker
no,
they
just
never
could
--
do
you
think
it’s
possible
for
a
church
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
college
without
any
--
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
is
it
that
makes
this
college
a
baptist?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
they
haven’t
said
that?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
cost,
mr.
figg,
may
they
also
cut
the
expenses
in
