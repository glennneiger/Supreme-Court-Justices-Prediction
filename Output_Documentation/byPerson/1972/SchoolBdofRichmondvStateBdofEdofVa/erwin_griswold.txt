mr.
erwin
griswold
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
an
inevitable
sequel
to
the
decisions
in
brown
i
and
ii
that
we
have
got
this
far
is
i
think
a
sign
of
progress.
the
only
constitutional
provision
which
is
applicable
here
is
the
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
says
that
no
state
shall
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
about
education,
about
quality
education,
about
racial
balance
or
racial
mix.
the
problem
in
the
brown
cases
clearly
arose
because
of
the
maintenance
of
dual
school
systems,
where
children
were
assigned
to
one
school
or
another
in
the
same
school
district
because
of
their
race.
that
was
what
was
attacked
there
and
no
greater
relief
was
there
claimed.
here
there
is
no
dual
school
system
in
richmond
under
plan
iii
now
in
operation.
whether
in
the
absence
of
a
dual
school
system
or
it's
vestiges
in
richmond,
the
equal
protection
cause
as
an
any
application
is
the
issue
now
presented
here.
before
i
proceed
further
i
would
like
to
refer
to
certain
phrases
which
i
used
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
in
72-550,
sometimes
taken
from
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
below
because
i
believe
that
they
are
or
can
be
misleading
or
an
unintentional
hindrance
to
thought.
for
example
on
pages
44
and
46
of
the
brief,
the
words
“greatest
possible
degree
of
desegregation”
appear.
now
this
is
an
attractive
phrase,
but
i
think
that
standing
alone
it
has
no
real
meaning.
it
takes
on
meaning
only
as
it
is
applied
to
a
specific
group
of
students
attending
schools
in
a
defined
area.
it
has
meaning
as
applied
to
the
students
in
the
city
of
richmond.
it
has
meaning
as
applied
to
students
attending
schools
in
a
larger
area,
but
it
does
not
help
them
in
the
task
presented
here
which
is
to
determine
whether
the
process
by
which
a
dual
school
system
is
effectively
disestablished,
can
be
extended
to
a
larger
area
not
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
dual
schools,
but
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
viable
racial
mix.
another
phrase
which
appears
several
times
in
the
brief
to
which
i
have
referred
and
in
the
district
court
opinion
is
“racially
identifiable
schools.”
again
i
suggest
that
this
phrase
has
no
operational
meaning
except
as
it
is
applied
to
a
particular
area.
there
are
many
schools
in
vermont
and
new
hampshire
and
other
states
which
are
a
100%
white
and
thus
i
suppose
they
are
racially
identifiable,
but
they
do
not
in
any
sense
violate
any
provision
of
the
constitution.
it
is
only
when
a
school
is
racially
identifiable
with
respect
to
something
else
that
the
phrase
has
any
legal
significance.
on
this
record,
there
are
no
schools
which
are
racially
identifiable
with
respect
to
any
other
school
in
the
city
of
richmond.
a
school
is
not
racially
identifiable
for
any
purpose
of
legal
significance
merely
because
it
is
70%
white
or
70%
black
or
indeed
100%
white
or
100%
black
and
i
doubt
that
that
presents
any
question
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
indeed
there
is
something,
somewhat
contradictory
and
unattractive
in
the
proposition
that
a
school
is
inferior
merely
because
it
has
a
certain
percentage
of
black
students.
unless
the
proportion
of
students
of
one
race
in
a
school
is
the
consequence
of
some
sort
of
invidious
discrimination
or
unless
it
leads
to
discrimination
through
inequality
of
appropriations,
it
should
be
colorless
legally.
here
is
the
place
where
the
constitution
should
be
color
blind.
yet
the
record
shows
that
it
was
this
sort
of
reasoning
which
led
the
district
courts
to
its
conclusion.
the
district
court's
order
is
based
on
a
concept
of
a
viable
racial
mix,
a
phrase
that
is
used
many
times
in
its
order
and
which
comes
directly
from
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
of
dr
little
and
dr.
pettigrove
(ph).
this
approach
has
already
been
judicially
answered
in
one
of
the
characteristically
illuminating
opinions
of
judge
sobeloff
in
the
brunson
case
which
is
quoted
at
pages
59
and
60
or
the
respondent's
brief,
the
notion
that
a
good
school
must
have
a
white
majority,
thus
as
judge
sobeloff
said
seem
to
constitute
a
direct
attack
on
the
roots
of
the
brown
decision,
yet
that
is
the
only
basis
of
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
erwin
griswold
and
that
mr.
justice
in
the
words
of
the
experts
is
a
school
population
with
28
to
no
less
than
20%
black
because
the
blacks
feel
isolated
if
there
is
less
than
20%,
no
more
than
40%
black,
because
the
white
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
--
enters
into
the
picture
and
the
consequence
is
that
what
it
means
is
there
must
always
be
a
white
majority
in
every
school
to
have
a
viable
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
no,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
the
testimony
of
the
experts
will
the
applicable
throughout
the
united
states
where
there
is
any
problem
of
racial
adjustment.
less
than
20%
makes
the
negro
feel
isolated
and
more
than
40%
means
that
there
is
risk
of
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice
i
think
the
testimony
of
the
experts
if
examined
will
show
that
in
their
opinion
in
any
situation
in
which
there
are
2
or
3
or
4%
black
students
that
that
is
undesirable
for
the
black
students
and
that
in
any
situation
in
which
there
are
50%,
60%,
70%
black
students
that
there
is
a
great
potentiality
of
white
flight.
and
here
the
children
of
chesterfield
and
henrico
counties
are
brought
into
the
picture
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
this
not
less
that
20
and
not
more
than
40%
of
the
black,
and
yet
why
stop
there.
as
the
map
of
the
close
of
the
respondent's
brief
shows
these
three
areas
are
completely
surrounded
by
other
counties
where
there
is
a
majority
of
black.
now,
why
shouldn't
some
of
the
chesterfield
and
henrico
students,
perhaps
those
living
close
by,
be
used
to
liven
the
mix
in
the
surrounding
territories.
indeed
this
is
just
a
way
to
test
the
district
court's
decision
below.
this
case
began
in
richmond
and
the
remedy
is
designed
to
improve
the
situation
in
richmond.
let
us
suppose
though
that
the
case
had
been
started
in
chesterfield
county
and
complaint
had
been
made
that
the
schools
in
chesterfield
are
racially
identifiable,
and
that
a
mix
of
20%
to
40%
black
students
is
preferable,
according
to
the
expert
testimony.
thus
it
seemed
conceivable
that
an
order
would
then
have
been
made
joining
richmond
as
a
party
defended
in
the
chesterfield
case,
and
then
bringing
richmond
students
into
chesterfield
in
order
to
provide
there
a
viable
racial
mix.
it
may
be
suggested
that
this
is
absurd,
but
i
wonder
if
it
is
really
different
from
what
the
district
court
undertook
to
do
here.
and
in
this
connection
i
would
like
to
refer
to
a
few
undisputed
facts.
the
combined
area
of
richmond,
chesterfield
and
henrico
is
752
square
miles.
that
is
more
10
times
the
area
of
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
63%
of
the
area
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
nearly
37%
of
the
area
of
the
state
of
delaware.
the
petitioner's
arguments
here
inevitably
lead
to
a
large
amount
of
centralization
and
concentration
of
control
over
these
schools.
and
logically,
there
is
no
reason
for
stopping
short
of
a
statewide
system.
indeed,
since
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
embraces
the
concept
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
stopping
short
of
a
single
national
school
system
with
a
viable
racial
mix
in
every
school.
this
is
very
close
to
the
problem
with
which
this
court
dealt
in
the
san
antonio
school
district
case,
where
it
concluded
that
the
equal
protection
clause
should
not
be
applied
so
mechanically
to
produce
a
type
of
overall
inflexible
egalitarianism,
which
is
indeed
alien
to
our
history,
and
to
our
institutions.
our
position
here
is
not
quite
as
broad
as
that
taken
by
the
respondents.
we
do
not
contend
that
school
district
lines
are
inevitably
or
inherently
inviable.
on
the
contrary,
in
the
scotland
neck
and
in
the
emporia
cases
last
term,
we
contended
that
district
line
should
be
disregarded
when
they
were
established,
or
put
into
effective
use
where
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
consequences
of
a
once
combined
and
segregated
school
system.
but
there
are
no
such
facts
here,
and
there
is
no
contention
here
that
these
district
boundaries
were
invidiously
established.
if
there
had
been
specific
instances
when
the
lines
have
been
used
to
maintain
segregation,
and
that
effect
continues
then
we
would
regard
the
district
lines,
the
district
court
as
having
power
to
look
into
that
situation
and
to
devise
an
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
i
think
mr.
justice,
that
that's
essentially
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
meant
and
that
becomes
very
apparent
when
the
district
court's
opinion
is
read
because
it
is
still
with
this
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
--
it's
just
to
achieve
a
viable
racial
mix.
mr.
erwin
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
i
think
that
if
this
were
historically,
and
always
had
been
a
single
school
district
then
there
would
not
be
–
then
there
would
be
racially
identifiable
schools
within
the
school
district.
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
am
not
sure
mr.
justice
that
would
have
been
the
case
very
close
to
the
charlotte's
school
case
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
--
where
this
court
had
said
that
an
absolute
racial
balance
throughout
the
system
was
not
required,
but
here
there
would
have
been
a
considerable
concentration
in
one
area.
it
would
have
been
not
unlike
the
situation
in
charlotte
before
the
district
judge
there
and
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
oh!
yes
mr.
justice.
it
has
to.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
is
critical
to
my
position
at
here.
there
is
a
section
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
am
saying
that
they
might
be
disregarded
where
it
is
shown
that
they
were
established
for
the
purpose
of
providing
or
maintaining
some
sort
of
discriminatory
consequence
with
respect
to
the
schools.
in
this
case
there
is
no
such
evidence
and
no
such
claim.
my
time
seems
to
have
expired,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
well,
i
have
only
a
little
more.
the
district
court
opinion
and
the
petitioner's
brief
do
rely
on
the
fact
that
some
richmond
schools
and
some
henrico
schools
are
“located
a
very
short
distance
apart”
and
i
would
mention
that
on
this
chart,
the
only
schools
that
are
shown
are
those
which
i
thought
to
be
close
to
the
boundary
line.
there
are
many
other
schools
in
between
which
are
not
shown.
i
think
though
that
there
is
less
here
that
meets
the
eye.
in
the
first
place,
seven
of
the
eleven
pairs
schools
and
i
would
call
attention
to
the
tabulation
at
page
429
of
the
appendix
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
seven
of
the
eleven
pairs
of
schools
are
more
than
three
miles
apart,
and
four
of
them
are
4.9
miles
apart,
and
up
to
6.2
miles
apart.
now
five
miles
is
as
far
as
from
the
capital
out
massachusetts
avenue
to
the
american
university.
now
two
of
the
schools
are
listed
as
1.4
miles
apart,
and
there
is
a
notation
that
this
is
eight
blocks
but
the
distance
of
1.4
miles
is
the
entire
length
of
pennsylvania
avenue
from
the
foot
of
the
capital
to
the
treasury
building,
that's
14
washington
blocks
on
a
diagonal.
if
1.4
miles
is
8
blocks,
that
allows
more
than
300
yards
per
block
which
are
rather
a
large
blocks.
mr.
erwin
griswold
how
far
what
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
believe
there
is,
i
am
not
familiar
with
what
it
is,
it
cannot
be
as
great
as
the
distances
involved
in
busing
the
children
from
henrico
into
richmond,
then
the
children
from
the
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
but
that
isn't
very
far.
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
richmond
in
many
places
is
more
than
five
miles.
i
am
suggesting
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
having
a
black
school
here
right
next
to
a
white
school
which
is
the
impression
which
is
sought
to
be
created
by
this
tabulation.
on
this
record,
there
are
no
invidious
local
examples
of
discrimination.
at
any
rate
that
is
not
the
basis
on
which
the
district
court
below
undertook
to
act.
the
basis
of
its
decision
was
the
desirability
of
establishing
a
viable
racial
mix,
a
phrase
which
it
used
repeatedly.
that
concept
we
submit
is
itself
invidious,
and
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
both
white
and
black.
accordingly
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
griswold
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
an
inevitable
sequel
to
the
decisions
in
brown
i
and
ii
that
we
have
got
this
far
is
i
think
a
sign
of
progress.
the
only
constitutional
provision
which
is
applicable
here
is
the
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
says
that
no
state
shall
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
about
education,
about
quality
education,
about
racial
balance
or
racial
mix.
the
problem
in
the
brown
cases
clearly
arose
because
of
the
maintenance
of
dual
school
systems,
where
children
were
assigned
to
one
school
or
another
in
the
same
school
district
because
of
their
race.
that
was
what
was
attacked
there
and
no
greater
relief
was
there
claimed.
here
there
is
no
dual
school
system
in
richmond
under
plan
iii
now
in
operation.
whether
in
the
absence
of
a
dual
school
system
or
it's
vestiges
in
richmond,
the
equal
protection
cause
as
an
any
application
is
the
issue
now
presented
here.
before
i
proceed
further
i
would
like
to
refer
to
certain
phrases
which
i
used
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
in
72-550,
sometimes
taken
from
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
below
because
i
believe
that
they
are
or
can
be
misleading
or
an
unintentional
hindrance
to
thought.
for
example
on
pages
44
and
46
of
the
brief,
the
words
“greatest
possible
degree
of
desegregation”
appear.
now
this
is
an
attractive
phrase,
but
i
think
that
standing
alone
it
has
no
real
meaning.
it
takes
on
meaning
only
as
it
is
applied
to
a
specific
group
of
students
attending
schools
in
a
defined
area.
it
has
meaning
as
applied
to
the
students
in
the
city
of
richmond.
it
has
meaning
as
applied
to
students
attending
schools
in
a
larger
area,
but
it
does
not
help
them
in
the
task
presented
here
which
is
to
determine
whether
the
process
by
which
a
dual
school
system
is
effectively
disestablished,
can
be
extended
to
a
larger
area
not
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
dual
schools,
but
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
viable
racial
mix.
another
phrase
which
appears
several
times
in
the
brief
to
which
i
have
referred
and
in
the
district
court
opinion
is
“racially
identifiable
schools.”
again
i
suggest
that
this
phrase
has
no
operational
meaning
except
as
it
is
applied
to
a
particular
area.
there
are
many
schools
in
vermont
and
new
hampshire
and
other
states
which
are
a
100%
white
and
thus
i
suppose
they
are
racially
identifiable,
but
they
do
not
in
any
sense
violate
any
provision
of
the
constitution.
it
is
only
when
a
school
is
racially
identifiable
with
respect
to
something
else
that
the
phrase
has
any
legal
significance.
on
this
record,
there
are
no
schools
which
are
racially
identifiable
with
respect
to
any
other
school
in
the
city
of
richmond.
a
school
is
not
racially
identifiable
for
any
purpose
of
legal
significance
merely
because
it
is
70%
white
or
70%
black
or
indeed
100%
white
or
100%
black
and
i
doubt
that
that
presents
any
question
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
indeed
there
is
something,
somewhat
contradictory
and
unattractive
in
the
proposition
that
a
school
is
inferior
merely
because
it
has
a
certain
percentage
of
black
students.
unless
the
proportion
of
students
of
one
race
in
a
school
is
the
consequence
of
some
sort
of
invidious
discrimination
or
unless
it
leads
to
discrimination
through
inequality
of
appropriations,
it
should
be
colorless
legally.
here
is
the
place
where
the
constitution
should
be
color
blind.
yet
the
record
shows
that
it
was
this
sort
of
reasoning
which
led
the
district
courts
to
its
conclusion.
the
district
court's
order
is
based
on
a
concept
of
a
viable
racial
mix,
a
phrase
that
is
used
many
times
in
its
order
and
which
comes
directly
from
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
of
dr
little
and
dr.
pettigrove
(ph).
this
approach
has
already
been
judicially
answered
in
one
of
the
characteristically
illuminating
opinions
of
judge
sobeloff
in
the
brunson
case
which
is
quoted
at
pages
59
and
60
or
the
respondent's
brief,
the
notion
that
a
good
school
must
have
a
white
majority,
thus
as
judge
sobeloff
said
seem
to
constitute
a
direct
attack
on
the
roots
of
the
brown
decision,
yet
that
is
the
only
basis
of
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
erwin
griswold
and
that
mr.
justice
in
the
words
of
the
experts
is
a
school
population
with
28
to
no
less
than
20%
black
because
the
blacks
feel
isolated
if
there
is
less
than
20%,
no
more
than
40%
black,
because
the
white
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
--
enters
into
the
picture
and
the
consequence
is
that
what
it
means
is
there
must
always
be
a
white
majority
in
every
school
to
have
a
viable
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
no,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
the
testimony
of
the
experts
will
the
applicable
throughout
the
united
states
where
there
is
any
problem
of
racial
adjustment.
less
than
20%
makes
the
negro
feel
isolated
and
more
than
40%
means
that
there
is
risk
of
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice
i
think
the
testimony
of
the
experts
if
examined
will
show
that
in
their
opinion
in
any
situation
in
which
there
are
2
or
3
or
4%
black
students
that
that
is
undesirable
for
the
black
students
and
that
in
any
situation
in
which
there
are
50%,
60%,
70%
black
students
that
there
is
a
great
potentiality
of
white
flight.
and
here
the
children
of
chesterfield
and
henrico
counties
are
brought
into
the
picture
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
this
not
less
that
20
and
not
more
than
40%
of
the
black,
and
yet
why
stop
there.
as
the
map
of
the
close
of
the
respondent's
brief
shows
these
three
areas
are
completely
surrounded
by
other
counties
where
there
is
a
majority
of
black.
now,
why
shouldn't
some
of
the
chesterfield
and
henrico
students,
perhaps
those
living
close
by,
be
used
to
liven
the
mix
in
the
surrounding
territories.
indeed
this
is
just
a
way
to
test
the
district
court's
decision
below.
this
case
began
in
richmond
and
the
remedy
is
designed
to
improve
the
situation
in
richmond.
let
us
suppose
though
that
the
case
had
been
started
in
chesterfield
county
and
complaint
had
been
made
that
the
schools
in
chesterfield
are
racially
identifiable,
and
that
a
mix
of
20%
to
40%
black
students
is
preferable,
according
to
the
expert
testimony.
thus
it
seemed
conceivable
that
an
order
would
then
have
been
made
joining
richmond
as
a
party
defended
in
the
chesterfield
case,
and
then
bringing
richmond
students
into
chesterfield
in
order
to
provide
there
a
viable
racial
mix.
it
may
be
suggested
that
this
is
absurd,
but
i
wonder
if
it
is
really
different
from
what
the
district
court
undertook
to
do
here.
and
in
this
connection
i
would
like
to
refer
to
a
few
undisputed
facts.
the
combined
area
of
richmond,
chesterfield
and
henrico
is
752
square
miles.
that
is
more
10
times
the
area
of
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
63%
of
the
area
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
nearly
37%
of
the
area
of
the
state
of
delaware.
the
petitioner's
arguments
here
inevitably
lead
to
a
large
amount
of
centralization
and
concentration
of
control
over
these
schools.
and
logically,
there
is
no
reason
for
stopping
short
of
a
statewide
system.
indeed,
since
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
embraces
the
concept
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
stopping
short
of
a
single
national
school
system
with
a
viable
racial
mix
in
every
school.
this
is
very
close
to
the
problem
with
which
this
court
dealt
in
the
san
antonio
school
district
case,
where
it
concluded
that
the
equal
protection
clause
should
not
be
applied
so
mechanically
to
produce
a
type
of
overall
inflexible
egalitarianism,
which
is
indeed
alien
to
our
history,
and
to
our
institutions.
our
position
here
is
not
quite
as
broad
as
that
taken
by
the
respondents.
we
do
not
contend
that
school
district
lines
are
inevitably
or
inherently
inviable.
on
the
contrary,
in
the
scotland
neck
and
in
the
emporia
cases
last
term,
we
contended
that
district
line
should
be
disregarded
when
they
were
established,
or
put
into
effective
use
where
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
consequences
of
a
once
combined
and
segregated
school
system.
but
there
are
no
such
facts
here,
and
there
is
no
contention
here
that
these
district
boundaries
were
invidiously
established.
if
there
had
been
specific
instances
when
the
lines
have
been
used
to
maintain
segregation,
and
that
effect
continues
then
we
would
regard
the
district
lines,
the
district
court
as
having
power
to
look
into
that
situation
and
to
devise
an
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
i
think
mr.
justice,
that
that's
essentially
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
meant
and
that
becomes
very
apparent
when
the
district
court's
opinion
is
read
because
it
is
still
with
this
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
--
it's
just
to
achieve
a
viable
racial
mix.
mr.
erwin
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
i
think
that
if
this
were
historically,
and
always
had
been
a
single
school
district
then
there
would
not
be
–
then
there
would
be
racially
identifiable
schools
within
the
school
district.
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
am
not
sure
mr.
justice
that
would
have
been
the
case
very
close
to
the
charlotte's
school
case
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
--
where
this
court
had
said
that
an
absolute
racial
balance
throughout
the
system
was
not
required,
but
here
there
would
have
been
a
considerable
concentration
in
one
area.
it
would
have
been
not
unlike
the
situation
in
charlotte
before
the
district
judge
there
and
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
oh!
yes
mr.
justice.
it
has
to.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
is
critical
to
my
position
at
here.
there
is
a
section
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
am
saying
that
they
might
be
disregarded
where
it
is
shown
that
they
were
established
for
the
purpose
of
providing
or
maintaining
some
sort
of
discriminatory
consequence
with
respect
to
the
schools.
in
this
case
there
is
no
such
evidence
and
no
such
claim.
my
time
seems
to
have
expired,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
well,
i
have
only
a
little
more.
the
district
court
opinion
and
the
petitioner's
brief
do
rely
on
the
fact
that
some
richmond
schools
and
some
henrico
schools
are
“located
a
very
short
distance
apart”
and
i
would
mention
that
on
this
chart,
the
only
schools
that
are
shown
are
those
which
i
thought
to
be
close
to
the
boundary
line.
there
are
many
other
schools
in
between
which
are
not
shown.
i
think
though
that
there
is
less
here
that
meets
the
eye.
in
the
first
place,
seven
of
the
eleven
pairs
schools
and
i
would
call
attention
to
the
tabulation
at
page
429
of
the
appendix
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
seven
of
the
eleven
pairs
of
schools
are
more
than
three
miles
apart,
and
four
of
them
are
4.9
miles
apart,
and
up
to
6.2
miles
apart.
now
five
miles
is
as
far
as
from
the
capital
out
massachusetts
avenue
to
the
american
university.
now
two
of
the
schools
are
listed
as
1.4
miles
apart,
and
there
is
a
notation
that
this
is
eight
blocks
but
the
distance
of
1.4
miles
is
the
entire
length
of
pennsylvania
avenue
from
the
foot
of
the
capital
to
the
treasury
building,
that's
14
washington
blocks
on
a
diagonal.
if
1.4
miles
is
8
blocks,
that
allows
more
than
300
yards
per
block
which
are
rather
a
large
blocks.
mr.
erwin
griswold
how
far
what
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
griswold
i
believe
there
is,
i
am
not
familiar
with
what
it
is,
it
cannot
be
as
great
as
the
distances
involved
in
busing
the
children
from
henrico
into
richmond,
then
the
children
from
the
--
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
but
that
isn't
very
far.
mr.
erwin
griswold
yes,
richmond
in
many
places
is
more
than
five
miles.
i
am
suggesting
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
having
a
black
school
here
right
next
to
a
white
school
which
is
the
impression
which
is
sought
to
be
created
by
this
tabulation.
on
this
record,
there
are
no
invidious
local
examples
of
discrimination.
at
any
rate
that
is
not
the
basis
on
which
the
district
court
below
undertook
to
act.
the
basis
of
its
decision
was
the
desirability
of
establishing
a
viable
racial
mix,
a
phrase
which
it
used
repeatedly.
that
concept
we
submit
is
itself
invidious,
and
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
both
white
and
black.
accordingly
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
should
be
affirmed.
