mr.
philip
b.
kurland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
question
on
this
case
is
not
whether
the
richmond
school
system
is
desegregated,
it
is.
there
are
no
children
included
or
excluded
from
any
richmond
school
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
richmond
school
system
is
unitary,
it
is.
there
is
no
school
in
the
richmond
school
that
is
racially
identifiable
as
white
or
black,
they
are
just
schools
in
richmond.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
a
desegregated
unitary
city
school
system
which
has
a
substantial
black
majority,
be
consolidated
with
two
other
independent
desegregated
unitary
county
school
systems
in
order
to
assure
a
white
student
majority
in
the
city
schools.
the
fundamental
facts
here
are
just
three.
the
richmond
school
system
has
a
substantial
black
majority,
the
county
school
systems
have
a
substantial
white
majority
and
the
district
court
plan
and
that
is
what
is
in
question
here,
the
plan
entered
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
is
under
review
here.
the
district
court
plan
in
question
would
create
a
single
consolidated
system
so
that
students
would
attend
schools
with
substantial
white
majorities.
the
issue
is
here
then
of
whether
a
ratio
of
seven
black
students
to
three
white
students
in
the
unitary
school
system
is
constitutionally
forbidden.
whether
a
ratio
of
seven
white
students
to
three
black
students
is
constitutionally
compelled.
with
court's
permission,
i
shall
address
myself
first
to
some
of
the
facts,
second
to
the
applicable
precedence,
third
to
the
question
of
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
violation
and
finally
to
the
problem
of
a
remedy.
this
action
was
not
one
initiated
against
the
counties
of
henrico
or
chesterfield,
desegregate
their
school
systems
because
those
school
systems
are
and
were
before
they
were
brought
into
this
case
desegregated
and
unitary.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
by
definition
your
honor
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
before
this
order
was
entered,
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
do
not
think
there
is
disagreement
as
to
the
fact
if
i
may
say
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
there
is
disagreement
as
to
conclusion.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
distribution
of
students
in
any
of
these
three
systems
is
raised
by
race.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
any
of
the
schools
in
each
of
these
three
school
systems
is
identifiable
by
race
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
is
a
unitary,
desegregated
school
system.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no
sir,
but
only
factual
basis
on
which
judge
merhige
could
reach
this
conclusion
was
that
the
percentage,
the
ratio
of
whites
in
the
county
schools
was
different
from
the
ratio
of
whites
and
blacks
in
the
city
schools,
the
problem
that
mr.
little
was
talking
about.
there
was
in
one
of
the
counties,
a
laboratory
school
attached
to
a
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right
which
is
hew
asked
be
desegregated
and
was
separated
from
the
system.
there
was
a
school
in
one
of
the
counties
which
over
a
period
of
time
had
turned
from
white
to
black
as
an
neighborhood
school
and
that
was
changed.
those
were
the
two,
on
which
any
notion,
besides
from
this
racial
proposition
which
any
notion
that
the
county
schools
were
not
desegregated
could
be
based.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
what
i
mean
is
that
within
the
city,
there
is
no
–
let
me
change,
in
accordance
with
this
court's
mandate
the
distribution
of
blacks
and
whites
within
these
schools
in
richmond
is
such
that
none
can
be
said
to
be
assigned
or
identifiable
as
black
as
others
as
well.
everybody
one
of
the
schools
comes
within
50%
of
the
total
richmond
ratio.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
what
would
i
say?
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
if
this
were
one
system,
distribution
of
students
would
not
be
satisfying
to
the
standards
of
the
school.
our
proposition
is
that
it
is
not
one
system,
but
the
power
of
the
state
legislature
to
affect
such
a
chance
certainly
exists,
as
with
the
power
of
this
court
is
not
to
do
so,
does
not
exist.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
any
sir?
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
you
mean
23-39%?
the
distribution
in
richmond,
your
honor
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
cannot
tell
you
whether
it
is
correct.
but
i
can
tell
you
by
looking
at
the
exhibit
on
page
155e
of
our
exhibit
your
honor,
you
will
see
the
distribution
of
schools
in
richmond.
there
are
59
schools,
there
none
with
all
black
populations.
they
are
none
with
90%
black
populations,
they
are
nine
with
80%
black
populations
and
the
other
50
are
under
80%
black
populations.
there
are
five
majority
white
schools.
bellmead
(ph)
has
63%,
webster
has
56%,
others
54-60
and
50.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
to
the
extent
--
if
it
is
not
your
honor,
if
the
distribution
of
whites
and
blacks
within
richmond
is
not
proper
then
the
order
of
the
district
court
should
be
directed
to
richmond
to
improve
that.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
you
are
absolutely
right.
you
would
have
a
attempt
to
single
out
a
school
as
a
white
school.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well
it
is
not
accident,
your
honor.
there
is
a
demographic
distribution
of
population
between
the
core
city,
not
only
here
but
in
every
city
in
the
united
states
i
suppose.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
nexus
between
the
alleged
wrong
doing
in
the
past
and
the
demographic
distribution
between
the
counties
and
the
city
here
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
--
which
is
of
the
essence
of
the
finding
of
inadequacy
of
the
trial
court
opinion.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
your
honor,
the
findings
did
not
support
the
basis
for
the
remedy.
the
findings
your
honor
are
all
in
terms
of
what
we
must
conceive
are
egregious
areas
in
violation
of
constitutional
provisions
in
the
past.
this
case
came
--
this
issue
came
in
1970,
after
if
i
may
say
so.
there
has
been
a
great
change.
this
school
system
or
free
school
systems
were
already
under
audit
and
were
already
desegregated
and
unitary
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
your
honor
was
that
there
was
an
absence
of
a
nexus,
what
had
been
done
in
the
past,
if
we
conceive,
abominate
is
not
because
of
the
distribution,
population
distribution
which
we
have
here.
as
i
say
this
case
originated
as
an
action
to
desegregate
the
richmond
school
system,
the
respondents
were
not
made
parties
to
the
action
until
after
the
richmond
school
system
came
under
a
decree
to
desegregate
in
accordance
with
this
court's
mandate
in
green
and
the
school
board
of
new
kent
county.
it
was
only
after
the
district
court
decreed
and
effected
a
unitary
plan
for
richmond,
that
richmond
proposed,
the
plaintiffs
embraced
and
the
trial
court
adopted,
consolidation
plan
called
on
a
respondent
counties
to
provide
students
of
the
richmond
school
system
to
assure
a
substantial
white
majority
in
every
richmond
school.
the
consolidation
plan
approved
by
the
trial
court
which
is
the
plan
under
review
here
would
assure
that
no
school
in
the
consolidated
system
would
have
a
student
body
of
less
than
60%
or
more
than
80%
white.
this
plan
has
no
function
or
effect
other
than
to
assure
this
specific
racial
balance
which
petitioners
experts
have
labeled
a
“viable
racial
mix.”
each
of
the
three
school
systems
here
is
already
a
large
well
functioning
school
system.
each
had
approximately
the
same
wealth
and
tax
base
for
pupil
for
educational
financing
except
that
richmond
afforded
a
slightly
larger
wealth
and
tax
base
than
either
of
the
two
counties.
each
was
an
integral
part
of
its
respective
county
or
city
government
and
has
been
so
since
the
origins
of
public
education
in
virginia
for
over
a
century.
the
geographic
division
of
a
counties
and
the
city
which
have
always
been
the
geographic
divisions
of
the
school
systems,
have
existed
since
before
the
founding
of
the
republic,
except
for
annexations
in
counties
by
the
city.
in
order
to
attain
a
viable
racial
mix,
the
trial
court
ordered
segregated
busing
of
about
70%
of
the
combined
systems
with
bus
loads
of
black
school
children
being
exported
to
henrico
and
chesterfield
schools
and
bus
loads
of
white
children
being
imported
to
richmond
school.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
the
busing
issue
sir
is
--
we
know
that
the
contention
of
busing
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
affecting
a
unitary
system.
we
do
suggest
that
they
are
difficulties
with
this
as
a
remedy
because
of
the
nature
that
the
busing
takes
here.
it
is
a
segregated
nature
of
the
busings
in
determining
whether
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
what
we
have
said,
your
honor,
is
that
busing
is
a
perfectly
appropriate
tool,
subject
to
the
limitations
expressed
by
this
court
in
swann
to
effectuate
the
desegregation
of
a
school
system,
but
we
say
though
that
when
you
measure
the
remedy
that
has
been
offered,
the
form
that
this
busing
takes
is
a
fact
that
the
court
must
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
remedies
are
appropriate
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
we
are
saying
that
the
court
was
wrong
because
that
was
the
function
and
affect
of
the
plan,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
it's
the
plan.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
actually
the
basic
issue
is
the
one
i
stated,
whether
it
can
cross
the
school
boundaries,
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
a
viable
racial
mix.
if
the
court
looks
at
the
record
created
by
the
city
of
richmond
and
the
plaintiffs
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
you
would
not
have
a
--
you
would
have
a
total
system
within
the
three
units
which
would
have
whites
--
identifiable
white
schools
and
identifiable
blacks
schools.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
i
would
be
here
attacking
this
plan,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
this
was
not
an
attempt
to
desegregate
the
unitary
system,
but
to
effectuate
a
specific
thesis
which
is
that
in
order
to
have
a
proper
school
system
you
need
a
ratio
of
between
60%
and
80%
white
and
no
more
than
40
unless
it's
100%.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right
and
it
is
our
response
for
petition
for
certiorari.
it's
quite
true
that
the
petitioners
have
run
away
from
the
factual
record
on
which
this
case
and
the
judgment
was
based.
they
say
the
plan
ordered
the
separation
of
the
school
systems
from
their
county
and
city
tax
basis.
it
ordered
the
evolution
of
the
county
in
city
school
boards
and
their
replacement
for
a
court
created
school
board
with
a
consequent
dilution
of
the
control
of
local
education
by
local
parents.
it
ordered
the
replacement
of
an
already
large
fully
equipped
school
system
or
three
already
large
fully
equipped
school
systems
by
a
single
school
of
system,
so
large
as
to
be
in
the
top
0.2%
of
american
school
systems.
and
it
did
this
and
this
is
my
point,
it
did
this
all
solely
for
the
effect
of
assuring
white
majorities
in
the
classrooms
of
richmond.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
this
restructuring
of
local
government
for
this
purpose
was
beyond
the
power
of
federal
courts
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
the
case
for
the
respondents
rests
on
three
propositions
established
by
this
court
in
four
of
its
most
recent
rulings
on
the
subject
of
school
desegregation.
all
of
these
decisions
support
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
judgment
of
affirmance
by
this
court,
may
rest
on
anyone
of
them.
all
of
these
precedents
would
have
to
be
rejected,
i
submit
if
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
is
to
be
reversed.
the
first
of
the
rules
established
by
this
court
on
which
respondents
rely
that
the
function
of
judicial
school
desegregation
decrees
is
to
transform
a
dual
system
into
a
unitary
school
system.
this
was
a
rule
established
in
green.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
new
kent
county
school
system
involved
in
green
like
the
richmond
school
system
is
a
black
majority
school
system
adjacent
to
a
white
majority
school
system
and
was
such
at
the
time
this
court
ordered
the
creation
of
a
unitary
system
within
new
kent
county.
command
of
green
was
accomplished
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case
and
it
approved
both
of
the
plans
proffered
by
the
plaintiffs
and
by
richmond
to
effect
a
unitary
school
system
in
richmond.
under
the
plans
approved
by
the
trial
court,
one
of
which
has
been
in
effect
in
richmond
for
the
past
two
school
years,
each
of
the
schools
in
richmond
appropriately
reflects
the
racial
composition
of
the
school
population
of
the
entire
system.
school
system
of
richmond
therefore
i
submit
is
unitary
in
accordance
with
the
requirement
of
green
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
in
recent
cases,
that
is
what
the
constitution
requires.
until
a
decision
by
the
trial
court
below,
there
had
not
been
a
single
decision
that
went
beyond
the
requirement
of
creating
a
unitary
school
system
out
of
a
dual
school
system,
except
where
school
system
boundaries
had
been
drawn
with
the
effect
of
perpetuating
a
dual
system
or
preventing
its
conversion.
the
second
rule
on
which
respondents
rely
was
established
by
this
court
in
swann
and
charlotte-mecklenburg
and
it
held
that
the
establishment
of
a
racial
balance
among
schools,
even
within
a
single
system,
was
not
a
constitutional
duty.
indeed,
the
court
said
in
swann
that
the
use
of
a
racial
balance,
other
than
as
a
starting
point
for
a
plan
to
restructure
a
dual
system
was
judicially
improper.
and
it
said
that
once
the
unitary
system
had
been
established,
as
is
the
case
here,
the
federal
court
had
fulfilled
its
constitutional
function
and
should
go
no
further,
even
in
the
face
of
later
demographic
changes,
not
attributable
to
invidious
governmental
action.
in
the
instant
case,
the
whole
purpose
and
effect
of
the
consolidation
plan
is
to
established
a
racial
balance
and
need
not
look
only
at
the
allegations
of
the
respondents.
the
petitioners
summary
of
their
plan
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
petitioners
testimony
in
support
of
the
plan
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
if
you
look
pages
18
to
30
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
that
a
viable
racial
mix
was
the
objective
of
this
plan.
i
call
it
racial
balance,
but
here
the
viable
racial
mix
was
defined
for
the
district
court
as
the
one
in
which
there
are
not
less
than
20%,
no
more
than
40%
black
students
in
every
school
in
the
system.
i
submit
that
the
consolidation
plan
accomplishes
nothing
else
in
the
effectuation
of
this
viable
racial
mix.
the
third
case
on
which
we
right
of
the
the
city
council
of
employer.
in
that
case
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
were
agreed
that
racial
balance
was
a
proper
objective
of
the
school
desegregation
decree.
majority
ruled
the
school
system
boundaries
could
not
be
redrawn
where
the
effect
of
such
action
would
be
to
leave
black
pupils
in
inferior
schools
and
inhibit
the
effectuation
of
the
unitary
system
theretofore
ordered
by
the
trial
court.
parenthetically
it
should
be
noted
that
the
single
school
system,
that
the
court
left
in
the
employer
case
at
a
racial
balance
approximately
the
same
as
that
which
exists
in
richmond.
it's
clear,
i
submit
from
employer
that
it
was
the
invidious
effect
of
the
manipulation
of
school
system
boundaries
that
permitted
the
trial
court
to
enjoin
the
separation
of
the
newly
created
city
school
system
from
the
county
system,
of
which
it
had
been
so
long
required.
in
this
case
there
is
no
possibility
of
charging
a
school
system
boundaries
as
ancient
as
these,
coterminous
as
they
are
with
the
county
and
city
governments
of
which
they
are
part
and
on
which
they
depend,
were
anyway
created
or
manipulated
with
the
effect
of
preventing
the
creation
of
a
unitary
system
in
richmond.
but
it
is
only
when
such
gerrymandering
is
occurred
that
the
court
has
sustained
the
power
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
interfere
with
the
allocation
of
functions
to
municipal
governments.
point
underlined
by
both
the
majority
and
dissent
in
employer
was
a
constitutional
right
to
local
control
of
educational
systems,
except
only
where
that
allocation
of
authority
was
a
means
to
preclude
the
establishment
of
the
unitary
system.
the
fourth
of
the
cases,
before
i
leave
that
point,
there
is
an
incident
of
local
control
which
i
think
is
not
irrelevant,
which
is
particularly
pointed
out
by
the
brief
of
–
the
amicus
brief
that
by
core,
that
not
only
will
the
consolidation
remove,
destroy
local
control
of
the
counties
and
the
governments,
in
effect
will
dilute
the
black
influence
that
has
become
existent
in
the
richmond
area,
where
they
now
have
three
of
the
seven
members
of
the
school
board.
the
fourth
of
the
cases
that
i
submit
is
controlling
here
is
spencer
and
kugler,
where
this
court
affirmed
the
proposition
that
school
system
boundaries
that
were
patterned
on
the
boundaries
of
local
government
units,
of
which
the
school
systems
here
are
an
integral
part,
are
not
subject
to
revision
by
a
federal
court
in
order
to
establish
a
better
racial
mix
among
the
separate
and
distinct
school
systems.
here
as
spencer
there
is
a
demographic
pattern
that
shows
a
concentration
of
black
population
within
certain
school
systems.
here
as
in
spencer
there
is
no
showing
that
the
demographic
pattens
are
in
any
way
a
consequence
of
governmental
actions
to
effectuate
the
separation
of
the
races.
the
fact
is,
insofar
as
the
demography
of
the
richmond
area
is
concerned,
the
racial
pattern
is
similar
to
that
of
all
city/suburban
areas
in
the
united
states,
north,
south,
east
and
west,
except
that
the
immigration
of
blacks
to
the
city
into
richmond,
is
smaller
than
most
of
such
areas.
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
review
here
is
consistent
with
and
indeed
required
by
in
each
of
the
precedents
established
by
this
court
in
these
cases.
what
petitioners
seek
here
is
a
major
departure
from
this
court's
precedents.
if
petitioners
are
to
succeed
here,
it
can
only
be
because
black
majority
school
systems
are
unconstitutional
per
se,
where
such
a
school
system
is
adjacent
to
a
white
majority
school
system,
although
both
school
systems
are
in
compliance
with
the
constitutional
commands
of
this
court.
the
only
alleged
deficiency,
the
only
alleged
deficiency
of
the
richmond
system
is
that
it
has
a
black
majority.
the
notion
of
the
intrinsic
inferiority
of
school
systems
with
black
majorities
as
asserted
by
petitioner's
expert
witnesses
is
for
the
reasons,
so
cogently
set
forth
in
judge
sobeloff's
opinion
in
the
brunson
case
basically
inconsistent
with
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
brown
v.
board
of
education.
the
other
unwarranted
innovation
which
petitioners
would
bring
about
is
a
duty
of
the
federal
courts
to
restructure
local
government
in
order
to
bring
the
different
racial
mixes
that
exists
within
cities
and
outside
cities
under
a
single
governmental
unit.
insofar
as
petitioner's
claim
rests
on
the
concentration
of
blacks
within
cities
and
the
concentration
of
whites
outside
cities,
a
nationwide
phenomenon
as
a
reason
for
joining
the
school
systems
its
arguendo
is
equally
valid
or
invalid
with
regard
to
every
governmental
function
performed
by
local
government
units.
the
general
problem
in
metropolitan
government
where
the
existing
cities
and
suburbs
can
continue
to
exist
as
separate
jurisdictions
or
must
be
combined
in
some
metropolitan
unit
is
a
most
complicated,
political,
social
and
economic
problem
which
has
many
aspects
other
than
schools,
but
which
is
not
and
cannot
be
the
concern
of
the
judiciary
in
our
system
of
government.
i'll
turn
if
i
may
to
the
question
of
a
existence
of
a
constitutional
violation.
as
this
court
reiterated
in
swann,
before
a
federal
court
may
intervene
to
substitute
its
authority
for
that
of
a
local
government,
there
must
have
been
a
constitutional
violation
committed
by
that
local
government
and
the
federal
court's
action
must
be
directed
to
a
cure
of
that
violation.
respondents
here
are
not
guilty
of
any
such
constitutional
violation,
so
the
necessary
predicate
for
federal
court
action
is
lacking.
what
the
petitioners
have
shown
is
only
there
is
a
concentration
of
blacks
in
the
urban
population
of
the
richmond
area,
the
concentration
of
whites
in
the
surrounding
areas,
but
there
is
and
could
be
no
showing
that
the
respondents
are
in
any
way
responsible
for
bringing
about
that
racial
distribution.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
are
two
things
that
were
not
shown.
it
was
not
shown
that
any
of
this,
resulted
in
a
demographic
distribution,
which
is
the
basis
of
their
charge
here.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
what
i
am
saying
here.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
the
housing
patterns
here
have
developed
as
a
result
of
state
action,
nothing.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
we
did
have
state
segregated
schools.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no
sir,
we
have
not
--
we
have
restricted
covenants
which
were
abolished
by
this
court
way
back
in
1940
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
with
this
distribution
of
population?
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
your
honor.
but
this
record
does
not
reveal
a
single
factual
basis.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that
is
what
i
assume
the
basis
for
judgment
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that
is
right,
your
honor
and
that
defiance
came
to
an
end,
that
defiance
came
to
an
end
before
this
order
was
passed
upon.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no
sir
the
suit
was
filed
1954,
certainly
not
before
that.
the
immediate
suit
that
was
brought
here,
the
basis
on
which
this,
the
mandate
complaint
came
after,
not
only
the
end
of
defiance,
but
the
adoption
of
a
equal
protection
provision
in
the
virginia
constitution
and
the
adoption
of
an
open
housing
law
by
the
state
of
virginia.
there
is
a
difference,
i
submit,
between
the
state
of
virginia,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
as
it
is
today
and
has
been
last
several
years
and
the
period
on
which
the
petitioners
have
predicated
basis
for
interference
with
virginia
government
action.
i
come
back
to
the
proposition
and
i
repeat
the
proposition
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
which
is
not
a
sure
record,
your
honor,
to
suggest
that
the
demographic
distribution,
which
is
the
basis
for
the
request
for
relief
was
in
anyway
caused
by
actions
of
the
state
or
any
of
the
respondents.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
don't
know
that
i
can
help
you,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
respondents
have
reached
that
point
spoken
off
by
this
court
in
swann.
that
point
in
time,
when
the
unitary
school
system
has
been
established,
and
one
of
the
time
for
the
federal
courts
to
abstain
with
interference
with
the
management
of
the
state
school
systems
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
action
as
causing
various
effects.
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
there
is
not
a
doubt
that
i
said
that
your
honor.
what
i
am
contesting
is
if
there
is
any
factual
basis
on
the
record
on
which
it
leads
to
that
conclusion.
i
cannot
give
you
record
references
to
the
absence
of
proof.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
don't
know
whether
it
came
from
the
blue,
i
know
it
did
not
come
from
the
record.
i
would
turn
if
i
may
to
the
last
issue.
even
where
this
court
has
found
the
constitutional
violation
as
with
the
attempted
withdrawal
of
the
employer
of
schools
in
the
county
system
perpetuates
segregation,
it
has
made
it
clear
the
proprietary
of
the
remedy
is
one
that
is
dependent
on
a
number
of
factors
to
be
weighed.
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
all
those
factors
weigh
against
the
remedy
here
which
is
the
consolidation
plan,
consolidation
plan
which
is
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
first,
the
remedy
is
not
responsive
to
any
constitutional
violation.
the
second
factor
of
timing
as
it
was
termed
in
employer
shows
that
here
is
there
--
the
new
plan,
the
consolidation
plan
was
not
forthcoming
from
the
city
until
after
a
unitary
plan
had
been
approved
and
established.
richmond
here,
like
employer
there,
moved
to
take
itself
out
from
the
unitary
plan
that
would
have
resulted
in
majority
of
black
schools
in
the
city
of
richmond.
there
is
no
showing
here
of
any
white
flight
from
the
city
schools
to
the
county
schools,
to
the
extent
that
there
has
been
white
flight
in
the
richmond
schools
has
been
somewhere
else
in
the
schools
of
the
respondents.
and
if
white
flight
from
the
public
schools
were
a
result
of
the
desegregation
of
the
richmond
school
system,
it
maybe
be
hazarded
that,
that
is
not
going
to
be
abated
with
the
consolidated
plan.
there
is
here
no
showing,
as
there
was
in
employer,
if
there
are
any
differences
in
quality
or
capacity
between
the
school
systems
of
richmond
and
schools
systems
of
counties.
on
the
contrary,
the
effect
of
the
consolidation
would
be
to
require
a
school
system
of
inordinate
size
with
the
consequent
problems
in
which
all
oversize
metropolitan
school
systems
suffer.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
there
is
no
doubt,
your
honor,
that
during
the
period
of
obstruction,
there
were
individual
students
which
crossed
state
lines.
there
has
never
been
in
the
history
of
the
state
of
virginia,
a
consolidation
of
school
systems.
the
only
consolidation
of
school
systems
that
exists
is
where
a
single
superintendent
has
been
appointed
as
the
chief
administrative
officer
for
two
school
systems.
but
those
school
systems,
each
maintain
their
own
pupil
placement,
their
own
teacher
employment
and
indeed
(inaudible)
has
been
suggested.
the
selection
of
the
superintendent,
although
it
does
come
with
the
approval
of
the
board,
state
board,
it's
usually
by
the
local
school
systems.
yes,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
there
was
in
the
past
crossing
of
state
lines
in
order
to
engage
in
unconstitutional
activities.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
don't
but
probably
with
the
line
of
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
certainly
your
honor,
the
city
of
richmond
has
the
power
to
place
at
schools.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
nobody
has
any
possibility
of
interfering
with
it
as
i
understand
your
honor.
kennedy
is
placed
in
henrico,
because
that's
what
richmond
wants.
they
have
the
power
and
they
suggested
even
now,
any
of
this
area
which
we
are
talking
about
is
possibly
subject
to
annexation
to
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
it's
the
richmond
school
board's
plan,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
but
they
are
not
asking
to
bring
this
area
--
this
plan
brings
in
the
entire,
two
counties
to
be
joined
with
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
am
saying
that
we
should
not
separate
--
create
new
school
systems,
new
forms
of
local
government
in
the
city
of
--
in
the
state
of
virginia
or
any
other
state
of
the
union.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
sir.
each
of
the
schools
within
each
of
the
systems
is
owned
by
the
school
system
that
operates
it.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
who
has
the
police
power?
i
mean,
it
has
attorney
general,
who
has
the
police
power
over
kennedy,
the
area
occupied
by
the
kennedy
school
system.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
city
of
richmond.
the
fifth
factor
to
be
weighed
in
terms
of
desirability
of
appropriateness
of
this
consolidation
plan,
is
the
destruction
of
the
local
control
of
the
school
boards.
in
fact
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
of
in
employer,
found
such
great
consequence
and
the
importance
of
which
was
underscored
by
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
texas
school
financing
cases.
i
would
submit,
that
if
this
plan
were
to
be
approved
by
this
court,
the
resulting
rule
would
require
a
reorganization
of
every
urban
and
suburban
school
district
in
the
nation.
by
changing
their
boundaries
and
removing
their
systems
from
local
control,
demographic
patterns
existent
here
and
that
is
the
basis
for
the
petitioner's
case
are
nationwide
and
not
local.
and
if
we
look
only
at
the
areas
adjacent
to
henrico
and
chesterfield
county,
the
map
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
that
the
district
court
were
to
adopt
petitioner's
thesis,
there
could
be
a
proper
demand
on
the
same
two
counties,
to
supply
their
white
students
not
only
to
richmond,
but
to
the
counties
of
charles
city,
dinwiddie,
amelia,
goochland,
and
new
kent
as
well
as
the
city
of
petersburg.
we
submit
that
such
a
vast
overhauling
of
the
school
system
of
the
nation,
will
not
have
happy
result
in
the
maintenance
of
public
schooling.
i
have
said
mr.
justice
white,
that
busing
is
not
an
appropriate
means
under
the
circumstances
described
in
swann
for
the
effectuation
of
the
unitary
system.
it
is
not
irrelevant
of
the
busing
involved
here,
it's
totally
segregated
busing.
it
has
to
be
of
what
you
are
doing
is
moving
whites
into
the
core
and
blacks
out
of
other
core.
we
submit
that
is
not
likely
to
help
solve
conflict
--
the
ratio
of
conflict
that's
existent.
the
children
of
richmond,
chesterfield
and
henrico
would
be
selected
by,
addressed
like
lottery.
the
distances
to
be
traversed
and
the
time
to
be
invested
are
necessarily
greater
than
under
the
existing
programs.
the
richmond
school
system
covered
63
square
miles.
the
proposed
consolidated
system
would
covers
752
square
miles
and
since
busing
would
be
to
and
from
the
city
of
richmond,
distances
must
necessarily
be
great.
we
submit
in
short
that
the
proposed
cure
would
be
far
more
deleterious
than
the
alleged
disease.
as
this
court
indicated
in
employer,
it
would
not
support
even
an
intra-system
plan
whose
consequences
would
be
egregious,
they
certainly
are
here.
in
sum
the
case
presents
a
simple,
but
important
question
whether
the
constitution
requires,
that
wherever
there
is
a
demographic
pattern
of
racial
separation,
school
systems
must
be
restructured
by
federal
courts
to
assure
the
presence
of
white
student
majorities
wherever
possible
.this
court
has
already
announced
that
racial
balance
within
a
school
system
is
an
objective
beyond
the
scope
of
the
federal
judicial
function.
a
fortiori
i
submit
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
federal
judicial
power
to
impose
racial
balance
among
independent
unitary
school
systems.
teaching
of
brown
id
the
court
please,
and
the
judgments
that
have
been
founded
upon
it,
is
not
that
there
must
be
a
racial
balance,
but
rather
that
the
races
should
have
equal
status.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
trial
court's
judgment
would
detract
rather
than
add
to
this
equality
of
status.
we
pray
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
question
on
this
case
is
not
whether
the
richmond
school
system
is
desegregated,
it
is.
there
are
no
children
included
or
excluded
from
any
richmond
school
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
richmond
school
system
is
unitary,
it
is.
there
is
no
school
in
the
richmond
school
that
is
racially
identifiable
as
white
or
black,
they
are
just
schools
in
richmond.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
a
desegregated
unitary
city
school
system
which
has
a
substantial
black
majority,
be
consolidated
with
two
other
independent
desegregated
unitary
county
school
systems
in
order
to
assure
a
white
student
majority
in
the
city
schools.
the
fundamental
facts
here
are
just
three.
the
richmond
school
system
has
a
substantial
black
majority,
the
county
school
systems
have
a
substantial
white
majority
and
the
district
court
plan
and
that
is
what
is
in
question
here,
the
plan
entered
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
is
under
review
here.
the
district
court
plan
in
question
would
create
a
single
consolidated
system
so
that
students
would
attend
schools
with
substantial
white
majorities.
the
issue
is
here
then
of
whether
a
ratio
of
seven
black
students
to
three
white
students
in
the
unitary
school
system
is
constitutionally
forbidden.
whether
a
ratio
of
seven
white
students
to
three
black
students
is
constitutionally
compelled.
with
court's
permission,
i
shall
address
myself
first
to
some
of
the
facts,
second
to
the
applicable
precedence,
third
to
the
question
of
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
violation
and
finally
to
the
problem
of
a
remedy.
this
action
was
not
one
initiated
against
the
counties
of
henrico
or
chesterfield,
desegregate
their
school
systems
because
those
school
systems
are
and
were
before
they
were
brought
into
this
case
desegregated
and
unitary.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
by
definition
your
honor
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
before
this
order
was
entered,
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
do
not
think
there
is
disagreement
as
to
the
fact
if
i
may
say
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
there
is
disagreement
as
to
conclusion.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
distribution
of
students
in
any
of
these
three
systems
is
raised
by
race.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
any
of
the
schools
in
each
of
these
three
school
systems
is
identifiable
by
race
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
is
a
unitary,
desegregated
school
system.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no
sir,
but
only
factual
basis
on
which
judge
merhige
could
reach
this
conclusion
was
that
the
percentage,
the
ratio
of
whites
in
the
county
schools
was
different
from
the
ratio
of
whites
and
blacks
in
the
city
schools,
the
problem
that
mr.
little
was
talking
about.
there
was
in
one
of
the
counties,
a
laboratory
school
attached
to
a
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right
which
is
hew
asked
be
desegregated
and
was
separated
from
the
system.
there
was
a
school
in
one
of
the
counties
which
over
a
period
of
time
had
turned
from
white
to
black
as
an
neighborhood
school
and
that
was
changed.
those
were
the
two,
on
which
any
notion,
besides
from
this
racial
proposition
which
any
notion
that
the
county
schools
were
not
desegregated
could
be
based.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
what
i
mean
is
that
within
the
city,
there
is
no
–
let
me
change,
in
accordance
with
this
court's
mandate
the
distribution
of
blacks
and
whites
within
these
schools
in
richmond
is
such
that
none
can
be
said
to
be
assigned
or
identifiable
as
black
as
others
as
well.
everybody
one
of
the
schools
comes
within
50%
of
the
total
richmond
ratio.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
what
would
i
say?
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
if
this
were
one
system,
distribution
of
students
would
not
be
satisfying
to
the
standards
of
the
school.
our
proposition
is
that
it
is
not
one
system,
but
the
power
of
the
state
legislature
to
affect
such
a
chance
certainly
exists,
as
with
the
power
of
this
court
is
not
to
do
so,
does
not
exist.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
any
sir?
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
you
mean
23-39%?
the
distribution
in
richmond,
your
honor
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
cannot
tell
you
whether
it
is
correct.
but
i
can
tell
you
by
looking
at
the
exhibit
on
page
155e
of
our
exhibit
your
honor,
you
will
see
the
distribution
of
schools
in
richmond.
there
are
59
schools,
there
none
with
all
black
populations.
they
are
none
with
90%
black
populations,
they
are
nine
with
80%
black
populations
and
the
other
50
are
under
80%
black
populations.
there
are
five
majority
white
schools.
bellmead
(ph)
has
63%,
webster
has
56%,
others
54-60
and
50.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
to
the
extent
--
if
it
is
not
your
honor,
if
the
distribution
of
whites
and
blacks
within
richmond
is
not
proper
then
the
order
of
the
district
court
should
be
directed
to
richmond
to
improve
that.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
you
are
absolutely
right.
you
would
have
a
attempt
to
single
out
a
school
as
a
white
school.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well
it
is
not
accident,
your
honor.
there
is
a
demographic
distribution
of
population
between
the
core
city,
not
only
here
but
in
every
city
in
the
united
states
i
suppose.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
nexus
between
the
alleged
wrong
doing
in
the
past
and
the
demographic
distribution
between
the
counties
and
the
city
here
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
--
which
is
of
the
essence
of
the
finding
of
inadequacy
of
the
trial
court
opinion.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
your
honor,
the
findings
did
not
support
the
basis
for
the
remedy.
the
findings
your
honor
are
all
in
terms
of
what
we
must
conceive
are
egregious
areas
in
violation
of
constitutional
provisions
in
the
past.
this
case
came
--
this
issue
came
in
1970,
after
if
i
may
say
so.
there
has
been
a
great
change.
this
school
system
or
free
school
systems
were
already
under
audit
and
were
already
desegregated
and
unitary
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
your
honor
was
that
there
was
an
absence
of
a
nexus,
what
had
been
done
in
the
past,
if
we
conceive,
abominate
is
not
because
of
the
distribution,
population
distribution
which
we
have
here.
as
i
say
this
case
originated
as
an
action
to
desegregate
the
richmond
school
system,
the
respondents
were
not
made
parties
to
the
action
until
after
the
richmond
school
system
came
under
a
decree
to
desegregate
in
accordance
with
this
court's
mandate
in
green
and
the
school
board
of
new
kent
county.
it
was
only
after
the
district
court
decreed
and
effected
a
unitary
plan
for
richmond,
that
richmond
proposed,
the
plaintiffs
embraced
and
the
trial
court
adopted,
consolidation
plan
called
on
a
respondent
counties
to
provide
students
of
the
richmond
school
system
to
assure
a
substantial
white
majority
in
every
richmond
school.
the
consolidation
plan
approved
by
the
trial
court
which
is
the
plan
under
review
here
would
assure
that
no
school
in
the
consolidated
system
would
have
a
student
body
of
less
than
60%
or
more
than
80%
white.
this
plan
has
no
function
or
effect
other
than
to
assure
this
specific
racial
balance
which
petitioners
experts
have
labeled
a
“viable
racial
mix.”
each
of
the
three
school
systems
here
is
already
a
large
well
functioning
school
system.
each
had
approximately
the
same
wealth
and
tax
base
for
pupil
for
educational
financing
except
that
richmond
afforded
a
slightly
larger
wealth
and
tax
base
than
either
of
the
two
counties.
each
was
an
integral
part
of
its
respective
county
or
city
government
and
has
been
so
since
the
origins
of
public
education
in
virginia
for
over
a
century.
the
geographic
division
of
a
counties
and
the
city
which
have
always
been
the
geographic
divisions
of
the
school
systems,
have
existed
since
before
the
founding
of
the
republic,
except
for
annexations
in
counties
by
the
city.
in
order
to
attain
a
viable
racial
mix,
the
trial
court
ordered
segregated
busing
of
about
70%
of
the
combined
systems
with
bus
loads
of
black
school
children
being
exported
to
henrico
and
chesterfield
schools
and
bus
loads
of
white
children
being
imported
to
richmond
school.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
the
busing
issue
sir
is
--
we
know
that
the
contention
of
busing
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
affecting
a
unitary
system.
we
do
suggest
that
they
are
difficulties
with
this
as
a
remedy
because
of
the
nature
that
the
busing
takes
here.
it
is
a
segregated
nature
of
the
busings
in
determining
whether
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
what
we
have
said,
your
honor,
is
that
busing
is
a
perfectly
appropriate
tool,
subject
to
the
limitations
expressed
by
this
court
in
swann
to
effectuate
the
desegregation
of
a
school
system,
but
we
say
though
that
when
you
measure
the
remedy
that
has
been
offered,
the
form
that
this
busing
takes
is
a
fact
that
the
court
must
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
remedies
are
appropriate
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
we
are
saying
that
the
court
was
wrong
because
that
was
the
function
and
affect
of
the
plan,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
it's
the
plan.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
actually
the
basic
issue
is
the
one
i
stated,
whether
it
can
cross
the
school
boundaries,
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
a
viable
racial
mix.
if
the
court
looks
at
the
record
created
by
the
city
of
richmond
and
the
plaintiffs
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
you
would
not
have
a
--
you
would
have
a
total
system
within
the
three
units
which
would
have
whites
--
identifiable
white
schools
and
identifiable
blacks
schools.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
i
would
be
here
attacking
this
plan,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
this
was
not
an
attempt
to
desegregate
the
unitary
system,
but
to
effectuate
a
specific
thesis
which
is
that
in
order
to
have
a
proper
school
system
you
need
a
ratio
of
between
60%
and
80%
white
and
no
more
than
40
unless
it's
100%.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right
and
it
is
our
response
for
petition
for
certiorari.
it's
quite
true
that
the
petitioners
have
run
away
from
the
factual
record
on
which
this
case
and
the
judgment
was
based.
they
say
the
plan
ordered
the
separation
of
the
school
systems
from
their
county
and
city
tax
basis.
it
ordered
the
evolution
of
the
county
in
city
school
boards
and
their
replacement
for
a
court
created
school
board
with
a
consequent
dilution
of
the
control
of
local
education
by
local
parents.
it
ordered
the
replacement
of
an
already
large
fully
equipped
school
system
or
three
already
large
fully
equipped
school
systems
by
a
single
school
of
system,
so
large
as
to
be
in
the
top
0.2%
of
american
school
systems.
and
it
did
this
and
this
is
my
point,
it
did
this
all
solely
for
the
effect
of
assuring
white
majorities
in
the
classrooms
of
richmond.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
this
restructuring
of
local
government
for
this
purpose
was
beyond
the
power
of
federal
courts
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
the
case
for
the
respondents
rests
on
three
propositions
established
by
this
court
in
four
of
its
most
recent
rulings
on
the
subject
of
school
desegregation.
all
of
these
decisions
support
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
judgment
of
affirmance
by
this
court,
may
rest
on
anyone
of
them.
all
of
these
precedents
would
have
to
be
rejected,
i
submit
if
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
is
to
be
reversed.
the
first
of
the
rules
established
by
this
court
on
which
respondents
rely
that
the
function
of
judicial
school
desegregation
decrees
is
to
transform
a
dual
system
into
a
unitary
school
system.
this
was
a
rule
established
in
green.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
new
kent
county
school
system
involved
in
green
like
the
richmond
school
system
is
a
black
majority
school
system
adjacent
to
a
white
majority
school
system
and
was
such
at
the
time
this
court
ordered
the
creation
of
a
unitary
system
within
new
kent
county.
command
of
green
was
accomplished
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case
and
it
approved
both
of
the
plans
proffered
by
the
plaintiffs
and
by
richmond
to
effect
a
unitary
school
system
in
richmond.
under
the
plans
approved
by
the
trial
court,
one
of
which
has
been
in
effect
in
richmond
for
the
past
two
school
years,
each
of
the
schools
in
richmond
appropriately
reflects
the
racial
composition
of
the
school
population
of
the
entire
system.
school
system
of
richmond
therefore
i
submit
is
unitary
in
accordance
with
the
requirement
of
green
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
in
recent
cases,
that
is
what
the
constitution
requires.
until
a
decision
by
the
trial
court
below,
there
had
not
been
a
single
decision
that
went
beyond
the
requirement
of
creating
a
unitary
school
system
out
of
a
dual
school
system,
except
where
school
system
boundaries
had
been
drawn
with
the
effect
of
perpetuating
a
dual
system
or
preventing
its
conversion.
the
second
rule
on
which
respondents
rely
was
established
by
this
court
in
swann
and
charlotte-mecklenburg
and
it
held
that
the
establishment
of
a
racial
balance
among
schools,
even
within
a
single
system,
was
not
a
constitutional
duty.
indeed,
the
court
said
in
swann
that
the
use
of
a
racial
balance,
other
than
as
a
starting
point
for
a
plan
to
restructure
a
dual
system
was
judicially
improper.
and
it
said
that
once
the
unitary
system
had
been
established,
as
is
the
case
here,
the
federal
court
had
fulfilled
its
constitutional
function
and
should
go
no
further,
even
in
the
face
of
later
demographic
changes,
not
attributable
to
invidious
governmental
action.
in
the
instant
case,
the
whole
purpose
and
effect
of
the
consolidation
plan
is
to
established
a
racial
balance
and
need
not
look
only
at
the
allegations
of
the
respondents.
the
petitioners
summary
of
their
plan
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
petitioners
testimony
in
support
of
the
plan
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
if
you
look
pages
18
to
30
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
that
a
viable
racial
mix
was
the
objective
of
this
plan.
i
call
it
racial
balance,
but
here
the
viable
racial
mix
was
defined
for
the
district
court
as
the
one
in
which
there
are
not
less
than
20%,
no
more
than
40%
black
students
in
every
school
in
the
system.
i
submit
that
the
consolidation
plan
accomplishes
nothing
else
in
the
effectuation
of
this
viable
racial
mix.

third
case

in
that
case

be
redrawn
where
the
effect
of
such
action
would
be
to
leave
black
pupils
in
inferior
schools
and
inhibit
the
effectuation
of
the
unitary
system
theretofore
ordered
by
the
trial
court.
parenthetically
it
should
be
noted
that
the
single
school
system,
that
the
court
left
in
the
employer
case
at
a
racial
balance
approximately
the
same
as
that
which
exists
in
richmond.
it's
clear,
i
submit
from
employer
that
it
was
the
invidious
effect
of
the
manipulation
of
school
system
boundaries
that
permitted
the
trial
court
to
enjoin
the
separation
of
the
newly
created
city
school
system
from
the
county
system,
of
which
it
had
been
so
long
required.
in
this
case
there
is
no
possibility
of
charging
a
school
system
boundaries
as
ancient
as
these,
coterminous
as
they
are
with
the
county
and
city
governments
of
which
they
are
part
and
on
which
they
depend,
were
anyway
created
or
manipulated
with
the
effect
of
preventing
the
creation
of
a
unitary
system
in
richmond.
but
it
is
only
when
such
gerrymandering
is
occurred
that
the
court
has
sustained
the
power
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
interfere
with
the
allocation
of
functions
to
municipal
governments.
point
underlined
by
both
the
majority
and
dissent
in
employer
was
a
constitutional
right
to
local
control
of
educational
systems,
except
only
where
that
allocation
of
authority
was
a
means
to
preclude
the
establishment
of
the
unitary
system.
the
fourth
of
the
cases,
before
i
leave
that
point,
there
is
an
incident
of
local
control
which
i
think
is
not
irrelevant,
which
is
particularly
pointed
out
by
the
brief
of
–
the
amicus
brief
that
by
core,
that
not
only
will
the
consolidation
remove,
destroy
local
control
of
the
counties
and
the
governments,
in
effect
will
dilute
the
black
influence
that
has
become
existent
in
the
richmond
area,
where
they
now
have
three
of
the
seven
members
of
the
school
board.
the
fourth
of
the
cases
that
i
submit
is
controlling
here
is
spencer
and
kugler,
where
this
court
affirmed
the
proposition
that
school
system
boundaries
that
were
patterned
on
the
boundaries
of
local
government
units,
of
which
the
school
systems
here
are
an
integral
part,
are
not
subject
to
revision
by
a
federal
court
in
order
to
establish
a
better
racial
mix
among
the
separate
and
distinct
school
systems.
here
as
spencer
there
is
a
demographic
pattern
that
shows
a
concentration
of
black
population
within
certain
school
systems.
here
as
in
spencer
there
is
no
showing
that
the
demographic
pattens
are
in
any
way
a
consequence
of
governmental
actions
to
effectuate
the
separation
of
the
races.
the
fact
is,
insofar
as
the
demography
of
the
richmond
area
is
concerned,
the
racial
pattern
is
similar
to
that
of
all
city/suburban
areas
in
the
united
states,
north,
south,
east
and
west,
except
that
the
immigration
of
blacks
to
the
city
into
richmond,
is
smaller
than
most
of
such
areas.
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
review
here
is
consistent
with
and
indeed
required
by
in
each
of
the
precedents
established
by
this
court
in
these
cases.
what
petitioners
seek
here
is
a
major
departure
from
this
court's
precedents.
if
petitioners
are
to
succeed
here,
it
can
only
be
because
black
majority
school
systems
are
unconstitutional
per
se,
where
such
a
school
system
is
adjacent
to
a
white
majority
school
system,
although
both
school
systems
are
in
compliance
with
the
constitutional
commands
of
this
court.
the
only
alleged
deficiency,
the
only
alleged
deficiency
of
the
richmond
system
is
that
it
has
a
black
majority.
the
notion
of
the
intrinsic
inferiority
of
school
systems
with
black
majorities
as
asserted
by
petitioner's
expert
witnesses
is
for
the
reasons,
so
cogently
set
forth
in
judge
sobeloff's
opinion
in
the
brunson
case
basically
inconsistent
with
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
brown
v.
board
of
education.
the
other
unwarranted
innovation
which
petitioners
would
bring
about
is
a
duty
of
the
federal
courts
to
restructure
local
government
in
order
to
bring
the
different
racial
mixes
that
exists
within
cities
and
outside
cities
under
a
single
governmental
unit.
insofar
as
petitioner's
claim
rests
on
the
concentration
of
blacks
within
cities
and
the
concentration
of
whites
outside
cities,
a
nationwide
phenomenon
as
a
reason
for
joining
the
school
systems
its
arguendo
is
equally
valid
or
invalid
with
regard
to
every
governmental
function
performed
by
local
government
units.
the
general
problem
in
metropolitan
government
where
the
existing
cities
and
suburbs
can
continue
to
exist
as
separate
jurisdictions
or
must
be
combined
in
some
metropolitan
unit
is
a
most
complicated,
political,
social
and
economic
problem
which
has
many
aspects
other
than
schools,
but
which
is
not
and
cannot
be
the
concern
of
the
judiciary
in
our
system
of
government.
i'll
turn
if
i
may
to
the
question
of
a
existence
of
a
constitutional
violation.
as
this
court
reiterated
in
swann,
before
a
federal
court
may
intervene
to
substitute
its
authority
for
that
of
a
local
government,
there
must
have
been
a
constitutional
violation
committed
by
that
local
government
and
the
federal
court's
action
must
be
directed
to
a
cure
of
that
violation.
respondents
here
are
not
guilty
of
any
such
constitutional
violation,
so
the
necessary
predicate
for
federal
court
action
is
lacking.
what
the
petitioners
have
shown
is
only
there
is
a
concentration
of
blacks
in
the
urban
population
of
the
richmond
area,
the
concentration
of
whites
in
the
surrounding
areas,
but
there
is
and
could
be
no
showing
that
the
respondents
are
in
any
way
responsible
for
bringing
about
that
racial
distribution.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
are
two
things
that
were
not
shown.
it
was
not
shown
that
any
of
this,
resulted
in
a
demographic
distribution,
which
is
the
basis
of
their
charge
here.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
what
i
am
saying
here.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
the
housing
patterns
here
have
developed
as
a
result
of
state
action,
nothing.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
we
did
have
state
segregated
schools.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no
sir,
we
have
not
--
we
have
restricted
covenants
which
were
abolished
by
this
court
way
back
in
1940
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
with
this
distribution
of
population?
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
your
honor.
but
this
record
does
not
reveal
a
single
factual
basis.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that
is
what
i
assume
the
basis
for
judgment
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that
is
right,
your
honor
and
that
defiance
came
to
an
end,
that
defiance
came
to
an
end
before
this
order
was
passed
upon.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no
sir
the
suit
was
filed
1954,
certainly
not
before
that.
the
immediate
suit
that
was
brought
here,
the
basis
on
which
this,
the
mandate
complaint
came
after,
not
only
the
end
of
defiance,
but
the
adoption
of
a
equal
protection
provision
in
the
virginia
constitution
and
the
adoption
of
an
open
housing
law
by
the
state
of
virginia.
there
is
a
difference,
i
submit,
between
the
state
of
virginia,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
as
it
is
today
and
has
been
last
several
years
and
the
period
on
which
the
petitioners
have
predicated
basis
for
interference
with
virginia
government
action.
i
come
back
to
the
proposition
and
i
repeat
the
proposition
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
which
is
not
a
sure
record,
your
honor,
to
suggest
that
the
demographic
distribution,
which
is
the
basis
for
the
request
for
relief
was
in
anyway
caused
by
actions
of
the
state
or
any
of
the
respondents.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
don't
know
that
i
can
help
you,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
respondents
have
reached
that
point
spoken
off
by
this
court
in
swann.
that
point
in
time,
when
the
unitary
school
system
has
been
established,
and
one
of
the
time
for
the
federal
courts
to
abstain
with
interference
with
the
management
of
the
state
school
systems
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
action
as
causing
various
effects.
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
there
is
not
a
doubt
that
i
said
that
your
honor.
what
i
am
contesting
is
if
there
is
any
factual
basis
on
the
record
on
which
it
leads
to
that
conclusion.
i
cannot
give
you
record
references
to
the
absence
of
proof.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
don't
know
whether
it
came
from
the
blue,
i
know
it
did
not
come
from
the
record.
i
would
turn
if
i
may
to
the
last
issue.
even
where
this
court
has
found
the
constitutional
violation
as
with
the
attempted
withdrawal
of
the
employer
of
schools
in
the
county
system
perpetuates
segregation,
it
has
made
it
clear
the
proprietary
of
the
remedy
is
one
that
is
dependent
on
a
number
of
factors
to
be
weighed.
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
all
those
factors
weigh
against
the
remedy
here
which
is
the
consolidation
plan,
consolidation
plan
which
is
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
first,
the
remedy
is
not
responsive
to
any
constitutional
violation.
the
second
factor
of
timing
as
it
was
termed
in
employer
shows
that
here
is
there
--
the
new
plan,
the
consolidation
plan
was
not
forthcoming
from
the
city
until
after
a
unitary
plan
had
been
approved
and
established.
richmond
here,
like
employer
there,
moved
to
take
itself
out
from
the
unitary
plan
that
would
have
resulted
in
majority
of
black
schools
in
the
city
of
richmond.
there
is
no
showing
here
of
any
white
flight
from
the
city
schools
to
the
county
schools,
to
the
extent
that
there
has
been
white
flight
in
the
richmond
schools
has
been
somewhere
else
in
the
schools
of
the
respondents.
and
if
white
flight
from
the
public
schools
were
a
result
of
the
desegregation
of
the
richmond
school
system,
it
maybe
be
hazarded
that,
that
is
not
going
to
be
abated
with
the
consolidated
plan.
there
is
here
no
showing,
as
there
was
in
employer,
if
there
are
any
differences
in
quality
or
capacity
between
the
school
systems
of
richmond
and
schools
systems
of
counties.
on
the
contrary,
the
effect
of
the
consolidation
would
be
to
require
a
school
system
of
inordinate
size
with
the
consequent
problems
in
which
all
oversize
metropolitan
school
systems
suffer.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
there
is
no
doubt,
your
honor,
that
during
the
period
of
obstruction,
there
were
individual
students
which
crossed
state
lines.
there
has
never
been
in
the
history
of
the
state
of
virginia,
a
consolidation
of
school
systems.
the
only
consolidation
of
school
systems
that
exists
is
where
a
single
superintendent
has
been
appointed
as
the
chief
administrative
officer
for
two
school
systems.
but
those
school
systems,
each
maintain
their
own
pupil
placement,
their
own
teacher
employment
and
indeed
(inaudible)
has
been
suggested.
the
selection
of
the
superintendent,
although
it
does
come
with
the
approval
of
the
board,
state
board,
it's
usually
by
the
local
school
systems.
yes,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
there
was
in
the
past
crossing
of
state
lines
in
order
to
engage
in
unconstitutional
activities.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
don't
but
probably
with
the
line
of
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
certainly
your
honor,
the
city
of
richmond
has
the
power
to
place
at
schools.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
nobody
has
any
possibility
of
interfering
with
it
as
i
understand
your
honor.
kennedy
is
placed
in
henrico,
because
that's
what
richmond
wants.
they
have
the
power
and
they
suggested
even
now,
any
of
this
area
which
we
are
talking
about
is
possibly
subject
to
annexation
to
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
it's
the
richmond
school
board's
plan,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
but
they
are
not
asking
to
bring
this
area
--
this
plan
brings
in
the
entire,
two
counties
to
be
joined
with
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
am
saying
that
we
should
not
separate
--
create
new
school
systems,
new
forms
of
local
government
in
the
city
of
--
in
the
state
of
virginia
or
any
other
state
of
the
union.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
sir.
each
of
the
schools
within
each
of
the
systems
is
owned
by
the
school
system
that
operates
it.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
who
has
the
police
power?
i
mean,
it
has
attorney
general,
who
has
the
police
power
over
kennedy,
the
area
occupied
by
the
kennedy
school
system.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
city
of
richmond.
the
fifth
factor
to
be
weighed
in
terms
of
desirability
of
appropriateness
of
this
consolidation
plan,
is
the
destruction
of
the
local
control
of
the
school
boards.
in
fact
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
of
in
employer,
found
such
great
consequence
and
the
importance
of
which
was
underscored
by
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
texas
school
financing
cases.
i
would
submit,
that
if
this
plan
were
to
be
approved
by
this
court,
the
resulting
rule
would
require
a
reorganization
of
every
urban
and
suburban
school
district
in
the
nation.
by
changing
their
boundaries
and
removing
their
systems
from
local
control,
demographic
patterns
existent
here
and
that
is
the
basis
for
the
petitioner's
case
are
nationwide
and
not
local.
and
if
we
look
only
at
the
areas
adjacent
to
henrico
and
chesterfield
county,
the
map
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
that
the
district
court
were
to
adopt
petitioner's
thesis,
there
could
be
a
proper
demand
on
the
same
two
counties,
to
supply
their
white
students
not
only
to
richmond,
but
to
the
counties
of
charles
city,
dinwiddie,
amelia,
goochland,
and
new
kent
as
well
as
the
city
of
petersburg.
we
submit
that
such
a
vast
overhauling
of
the
school
system
of
the
nation,
will
not
have
happy
result
in
the
maintenance
of
public
schooling.
i
have
said
mr.
justice
white,
that
busing
is
not
an
appropriate
means
under
the
circumstances
described
in
swann
for
the
effectuation
of
the
unitary
system.
it
is
not
irrelevant
of
the
busing
involved
here,
it's
totally
segregated
busing.
it
has
to
be
of
what
you
are
doing
is
moving
whites
into
the
core
and
blacks
out
of
other
core.
we
submit
that
is
not
likely
to
help
solve
conflict
--
the
ratio
of
conflict
that's
existent.
the
children
of
richmond,
chesterfield
and
henrico
would
be
selected
by,
addressed
like
lottery.
the
distances
to
be
traversed
and
the
time
to
be
invested
are
necessarily
greater
than
under
the
existing
programs.
the
richmond
school
system
covered
63
square
miles.
the
proposed
consolidated
system
would
covers
752
square
miles
and
since
busing
would
be
to
and
from
the
city
of
richmond,
distances
must
necessarily
be
great.
we
submit
in
short
that
the
proposed
cure
would
be
far
more
deleterious
than
the
alleged
disease.
as
this
court
indicated
in
employer,
it
would
not
support
even
an
intra-system
plan
whose
consequences
would
be
egregious,
they
certainly
are
here.
in
sum
the
case
presents
a
simple,
but
important
question
whether
the
constitution
requires,
that
wherever
there
is
a
demographic
pattern
of
racial
separation,
school
systems
must
be
restructured
by
federal
courts
to
assure
the
presence
of
white
student
majorities
wherever
possible
.this
court
has
already
announced
that
racial
balance
within
a
school
system
is
an
objective
beyond
the
scope
of
the
federal
judicial
function.
