justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
coleman
as
i
understand
that
the
busing
issue
was
a
separate
matter,
it
is
not
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
of
busing
is
not
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whether
there
is
too
much
or
too
little
or
whether
there
is
any
at
all
or
not
is
irrelevant
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
mr.
kurland
if
the
state
legislature
suddenly
consolidated
these
three
counties
for
purposes
of
operating
schools,
say
these
three
school
districts
were
consolidated
suddenly?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
a
suit
which
charged
that
there
was
not
unitary
school
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
am
i
to
understand
that
you
are
arguing
at
a
separate
ground
for
sustaining
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
that
there
is
--
it
relates
to
busing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
not
urging
--
and
you
are
not
urging
there
is
a
separate
reason
for
affirming
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
district
court,
not
that
it
was
implementing
some
racial
balance
idea.
i
mean,
you
are
not
saying
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
solely
for
that
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
the
issue
that's
here
is
what
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
the
issue
here
is
the
plan
but
the
issue
as
to
whether
--
is
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeal
was
right
in
saying
that
the
district
court
could
not
cross
these
school
boundaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
thought
you
said,
i
want
to
know
if
this
–
if
all
of
these
three
districts
were
together,
the
distribution
of
blacks
and
whites
would
not
be
acceptable?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
whole
--
if
the
three
school
districts
were
together
and
were
one
system,
would
you
will
be
here
attacking
this
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
the
question
that
is
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
you
are
--
you
are
urging
it
as
a
respondent,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
how
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
your
view
say
that
there
was
an
independent
reason
for
reversal
of
the
district
court
in
that
the
district
court
attempted
to
establish
a
racial
quota
or
establish
a
racial
balance
among
all
the
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
you
read
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
have
reverse
the
district
court
even
if
the
boundary
line
question
were
not
a
separate
issue
in
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
that
isn't
the
question.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
in
proceeding
--
if
historically
this
has
always
been
one
area,
and
it
had
been
racially
segregated
and
the
problem
was
to
just
establish
the
dual
school
system.
would
the
court
of
appeals
then
have
reversed
a
district
court
because
of
the
way
it
approached
it
in
terms
of
racial
quotas,
or
racial
mixes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
would
be
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
it
must
be
that
the
district
court
of
appeals
didn't
use
that
factor
as
a
separate
independent
grounds
for
reversing
the
district
court.
the
boundary
line,
the
boundary
line
issue
has
to
be
--
has
to
be
--
is
critical
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
coleman
can
i
ask
you
something.
in
your
petition
of
certiorari,
you
present
the
single
question
of
whether
or
not
a
federal
court
may
go
beyond
the
geographic
boundaries
of
a
school
district
in
providing
a
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
single
question.
now
let's
assume
we
agreed
with
you
and
said
that
it
may
go
beyond.
would
we
just
say
reversed
and
not
reach
anything
else
in
this
case?
is
there
another
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
have
asked
to
do
it.
i
had
asked
you
a
question.
is
there
another
question
in
the
case,
you
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
don't
--
we
haven't
got
judge
merhige
to
affirm.
here
we
have
got
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
is
there
any
other
question
we
must
reach
before
reversing?
justice
byron

mr.

as
