mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
19
years
after
brown,
state
created
school
division
lines
which
were
bamboo
curtains
in
the
cause
of
school
segregation
in
virginia,
lines
which
were
freely
and
repeatedly
crossed
and
ignored
to
maintain
segregated
schools
in
virginia,
now
become
iron
curtains
constituting
an
absolute
bar
to
the
effective
desegregation
plan
before
the
court
below.
for
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
virginia
through
its
spate
school
officials,
its
legislature
and
its
school
division,
including
that
of
richmond,
repeatedly
and
consistently
violated
the
black
petitioner's
constitutional
right
to
attend
public
schools
free
from
state
sponsored
racial
segregation.
in
other
words,
the
question
here
is
whether
a
district
court
is
without
power
to
prove
a
desegregation
relief
plan,
solely
because
it
involves
inner
division
of
assignment
of
pupils
among
adjacent
divisions.
and
if
this
court
determines
that
that
power
does
exists,
was
there
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion
to
exercise
it
here
when
the
record
includes
undisturbed
findings
that;
one,
virginia
including
the
three
sub
--
the
three
school
divisions
here
involved,
repeatedly
ignored
the
division
lines
to
revert
to
preserve
segregated
schools.
second,
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
achieve
effective
and
complete
desegregation
within
the
confines
of
virginia
--
of
richmond
school
division
itself.
third,
that
repeated
unconstitutional
acts
and
intentional
delays
directed
by
virginia
created
this
situation.
fourth,
the
school
division
line
served
no
useful
administrative
or
educational
purpose
and
the
result
of
such
failure
would
to
be
to
have
black
and
white
schools
within
walking
distance
of
each
other.
in
addition,
the
two
adjoining
school
divisions
here
involved,
henrico
and
chesterfield,
were
themselves
operating
non-unitary
racial
system.
petitioners
in
number
72-550
are
black
school
children.
the
defendants
are
the
state
board
of
education,
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction,
the
three
division,
school
superintendents
who
under
virginia
law
incidentally
are
centrally
nominated.
the
legislative
bodies
of
richmond,
henrico
and
chesterfield
and
the
school
boards
of
these
three
divisions,
each
of
which
under
virginia
law
is
an
administrative
subdivision
of
the
state.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
under
virginia
law,
it’s
provided
that
the
state
board
of
education
makes
up
a
list
of
people
eligible
to
be
appointed
and
the
school
divisions
can
appoint
only
from
that
list.
and
in
fact,
the
virginia
law
provides
that
if
within
60
days
the
person
is
not
appointed
if
there
is
a
vacancy,
the
state
board
itself
makes
the
appointment
and
incidentally
in
this
case,
the
school’s
superintendent
of
the
division
of
chesterfield
was
appointed
in
that
manner.
he
was
appointed
by
the
state
because
chesterfield
within
60
days
had
not
made
the
appointment.
now
from
1871
until
the
time
of
the
brown
decision,
virginia’s
constitution,
its
statues
and
all
of
it’s
policy
making
authorities
compel
each
school
division
to
operate
racially
segregated
schools.
at
the
time
of
the
brown
decision,
the
school
population
of
the
richmond
division
was
43%
black
and
57%
white.
in
chesterfield,
it
was
21%
black
and
79%
white.
in
henrico,
it
was
11%
black
and
89%
white.
for
the
three
divisions
together,
however,
the
composite
figure
was
33.7%
black
and
66.3%
white.
and
as
i
stated
before
in
each
division
regardless
of
what
the
local
division
would
want
to
do,
by
state
law,
black
and
white
had
to
attend
wholly
separate
schools.
now
unfortunately,
brown
brought
no
change
whatsoever.
on
pages
18
through
22
of
our
brief,
we
recount
the
very
successful
state
actions
by
state
officials
with
school
division
cooperation
to
keep
virginia
schools
segregated
into
position,
then
a
statute
under
which
the
governor
would
takeover
any
school
which
voluntarily
or
by
quota
admitted
blacks,
then
a
pupil
placement
law
and
then
the
state
tuitions
laws.
now
the
pupil
placement
law
as
this
court
knows
was
particularly
effective.
as
stated
in
bradley,
it
took
out
of
the
hands
of
the
school
boards
and
school
superintendent
any
decision
relating
to
the
integration
of
the
school.
and
so
in
1961,
these
black
petitioners
brought
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
black
children
in
virginia
against
state
officials
and
quoting
the
richmond
school
division
to
be
admitted
to
white
schools
despite
the
provision
of
the
pupil
placement
law.
the
district
court
granted
limited
relief,
but
not
class
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
directing
class
reliefs.
the
commonwealth
and
the
richmond
school
division,
then
sought
to
invert
the
impact
of
this
decision
by
introducing
a
freedom
of
choice
plan.
this
plan
was
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
this
court
reversed
because
the
plan
failed
to
deal
with
desegregation
of
teachers.
it
was
now
1966,
12
years
after
brown,
a
consent
decree
was
added
into
involving
of
freedom
of
choice
plan,
placing
the
affirmative
duty
on
school
authorities
to
modify
free
choice,
if
it
did
not
result
in
effective
desegregation.
unfortunately,
segregation
continued,
but
the
school
officials
took
no
action
whatsoever.
for
this
reason,
the
black
petitioners
on
march
10,
1970
filed
for
further
relief
pursuant
to
this
court's
ruling
in
green.
on
that
date,
even
though
the
composite
racial
make
up
of
the
three
divisions
had
not
altered,
which
you
recall
i
said
33.7%
black
and
66.3%
white,
the
makeup
in
virginia
had
become
64.2%
black
and
35.8%
white,
while
chesterfield
had
become
9.5%
black,
90%
white
and
henrico,
8.1%
black
and
91.9%
white.
now
at
that
point,
this
is
1970
now,
just
two-and-a-half
years
ago,
the
richmond
school
board
admitted
that
it
had
been
and
it
was
in
violation
of
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
the
schools
were
still
rigidly
segregated
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
please
turn
to
pages
167
and
168
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
167
a,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
168
a
and
just
look
at
the
situation
and
this
is
1970.
of
the
seven
high
schools,
three
were
100%
black,
one
was
99.26%
white.
in
other
words,
six
of
the
seven
schools
by
any
test
you
could
make
were
clearly
racially
identifiable.
the
middle
schools,
six
of
the
seven
were
clearly
racially
identifiable.
the
elementary
schools,
almost
all
of
them
were
clearly
racially
identifiable.
the
faculty
and
staff
were
clearly
racially
identifiable.
now
i
am
confident,
now
this
is
16
years
after
brown,
i
am
confident
that
no
one
can
stand
up
before
the
bar
of
this
court
and
question
the
correctness
of
the
district
court's
resulting
finding
at
pages
168
a,
169
a
pardon
me,
where
the
court
says
that
the
schools
were
racially
segregated,
racially
identifiable
and
violative
of
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
now
frankly
we
find
it
impossible
to
characterize
such
contemporary
facts
as
“history
or
original
sin”
as
respondents
do
at
pages
47
and
73
of
that
brief.
at
that
point,
the
district
court's
job
was
attempt
to
see
that
the
school
board
would
produce
a
plan
which
would
effectively
desegregate
the
public
school.
the
richmond
school
board
continued
to
file
inadequate
interim
plan
which
were
approved
only
because
of
time
pressure
and
the
schools
would
have
to
open
at
the
time.
in
each
case,
the
court
specifically
found
that
these
interim
plans
did
not
conform
to
constitutional
requirements.
then
on
november
4,
1970,
the
richmond
school
board
stating
under
oath
that
it
was
impossible
to
desegregate
the
schools
in
the
context
of
richmond,
moved
to
join
the
adjacent
divisions
of
henrico
and
chesterfield
counties.
the
state
board
of
education
and
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instructions
and
at
that
time,
the
black
petitioners
filed
a
second
amended
complaint
which
again
asked
for
relief
on
behalf
of
all
children
throughout
virginia.
they
asked
that
the
adjoining
school
divisions
be
included
in
a
desegregation
plan
either
by
consolidation
or
by
contractual
arrangements.
now
after
trial,
and
i
wish
the
court
to
follow
me
through
these
findings,
that
i
really
saying
that
in
this
case,
unless
you
can
upset
these
findings
that
this
case
has
to
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
black
petitioners.
that
at
trial,
at
the
trial,
full
trial
now,
the
district
court
found
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
this
was
filed
in
1970,
your
honor
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
in
1970.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir,
that
was
not
done,
what
happened
was,
your
honor,
that
they
were
trying
to
come
up
with
an
effective
plan.
in
the
course
of
that
mr.
little
who
is
of
the
richmond
school
division
said
that
the
only
way
you
could
have
a
plan
would
be
that
you
involve
the
other
counties.
at
that
point
the
judge
in
a
letter
which
appears
i
think,
on
about
page
150a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
indicated,
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
here
and
we
want
the
lawyers
to
co-operate.
then
the
school
board
filed
the
motion
and
it's
attached
to
the
--
there
is
a
order
in
which
there
is
a
motion
to
recuse
the
judge
and
it's
attached
to
that
order,
your
honor.
it's
58
a,
is
the
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
this
once
again
of
the
petition,
your
honor,
and
it's
at
page
81.
if
you
read
the
letter
sir,
and
once
you
read
that
letter,
i
am
confident
that
you
will
not
conclude
that
that
was
an
invitation
on
part
of
anybody
to
file
a
claim.
in
other
words,
the
findings
were
that
one,
the
pupil
assignment
patterns
and
then
three
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
as
i
go
through,
i
will
give
them
to
you.
the
pupil
assignment
patterns
in
the
three
school
divisions
showed
great
disparity
in
1971
racial
composition,
making
both
individual
school
facilities
and
the
entire
three
systems
racially
identifiable.
he
said
that
the
richmond
system
is
identifiable
as
black
and
that
that
of
each
county
is
perceived
as
a
white
system.
that's
on
page
201a,
208a.
that
a
great
number
of
one
race
schools
had
recently
existed
and
i
repeat
some
still
exist,
that's
at
page
186a,
201a.
he
also
found
that
at
the
time
chesterfield
and
henrico
were
enjoined
and
at
the
close
of
the
record,
each
was
operating
a
non-unitary
school
system
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
that's
at
page
524a
of
the
record,
526a
of
the
record
with
respect
to
chesterfield
and
page
527a
of
the
record
and
529a
of
the
record
with
respect
to
henrico.
it
further
found
that
past
and
continuing
action
by
state
authorities
interfering
with
desegregation
that
a
constitutional
plan
for
the
city
and
for
the
counties
as
well
cannot
be
achieved
within
current
school
division
boundaries,
that
findings
are
at
237a,
207a
and
201a.
he
concluded
that
the
defendants
should
not
be
permitted
to
profit
by
self
created
problems
and
that's
at
page
237a.
finally
he
found
that
at
the
time
the
record
closed
each
division
still
operated
a
school
system
which
was
in
some
respect
non-unitary.
the
court
never
found,
as
respondents
would
have
you
believe
by
pages
8
of
their
brief
that
anyone
of
three
divisions
had
ever
achieved
a
unitary
status
and
i
ask
you
to
look
at
the
chart
in
the
appendix
to
the
court
opinion
which
shows
that
each
division
operates
racially
identifiable
school
and
the
chart
is
in
volume
ii,
beginning
on
page
524
where
he
takes
the
schools
of
chesterfield
county,
then
henrico
county
and
richmond
and
i
assure
when
you
will
examine
those,
you
will
find
that
in
each
instance
in
this
record
everyone
of
these
schools
were
racially
identifiable.
the
other
thing
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
attached
your
honor
to
petition
--
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it's
a
chart,
it
is
524,
your
honor.
white
and
--
with
respect
to
chesterfield
county
any
test
you
will
apply,
you
would
have
to
say
three
out
of
those
six
schools
are
identifiable
as
white.
now
another
thing
that
i
would
like
to
clear
up
in
this
case,
the
judge
never
found
and
we
don't
urge
that
the
absence
of
a
quota
gives
rise
to
constitutional
violation
and
i
would
just
ask
you
to
read
page
519a
of
the
record,
once
again
in
the
same
opinion,
i
mean
the
same,
the
opinion
which
is
in
the
appendix.
now
once
he
found
these
massive
constitutional
violations,
he
had
a
constitutional
duty
to
end
them
and
in
charlotte
the
swan
case,
in
davis
this
court
has
said
that
once
there
is
a
violation
the
court
should
take
all
steps
necessary
to
end
that
violation
and
to
end
the
effects
of
it.
now
the
only
reason
and
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
case
any
different
from
davis
and
swann
is
something
that
the
my
friends
tried
to
raise
namely
this
division
line.
and
i
stand
here
and
say
once
again,
that
in
order
to
maintain
segregated
schools,
this
line
was
never
observed.
students
freely
were
taken
back
and
forth
across
this
line.
you
will
find
from
this
record
now
for
example
that
the
kennedy
school
which
is
under
the
richmond
division
is
actually
situated
in
henrico
county
and
black
children,
kennedy
is
now
about
80%
black
and
if
you
look
at
pages,
8
of
our
brief,
we
set
out
a
table
for
you
on
page
eight
and
here
you
have
a
situation
where
kennedy
high
school
built
in
1967,
opened
as
a
black
school
now
over
80%
black,
in
fact
is
93%
black
as
of
now,
that
within
four
miles
of
that
school
is
a
henrico
high
school
which
is
4%
black.
now
that's
the
problem
that
the
district
judge
had
here.
he
looked
at
this
map
and
he
saw
that
you
had
a
array
in
the
richmond
school
division
of
black
schools
measured
by
any
test
that
you
want
to
measure,
tight
on
top
of
them,
outside
in
the
counties,
in
these
counties,
there
were
white
schools.
now
certainly
in
swann
what
you
did
was
to
approve
a
plan
which
said
that
you
should
desegregate
the
schools
and
that
you
send
students
by
contiguous
zones,
by
busing
to
these
various
places.
now
here
the
only
reason
is
this
line.
now
i
assure
you,
the
record
will
show
and
will
clearly
show,
this
line
is
an
arbitrary
line,
was
never
used
to
--
when
there
were
segregated
schools.
the
judge
found
out
at
page
193a
of
the
record
in
his
opinion.
also
in
the
record
at,
this
record
now
sir,
at
page
912,
this
testimony
that
under
the
state
tuition
law,
when
a
black
child
would
get
the
right
to
go
to
school
in
richmond
and
then
if
the
white
parent
didn't
like
it,
he
under
the
state
tuition
law
as
you
know
mr.
justice
white,
would
opt
out
and
go
some
place
else.
that
the
state
paid
the
tuition
and
the
white
child
went
out
of
the
county,
that's
all
in
912a
of
the
record.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
footnote
two
of
the
--
footnote
two
of
the
court
of
appeals,
says
this
is
not
busing
case.
the
record
is
clear
here
that
the
amount
of
busing
involved
here
is
less
than
it
was.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
not
in
this
case,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
irrelevant.
the
sole
issue
here
your
honor
is
that
when
a
judge
finds
as
a
fact
that
these
lines
have
been
repeatedly
ignored
in
the
course
of
segregation,
can
you
--
do
they
then
become
an
iron
curtain
when
you
attempt
to
integrate
the
school,
particularly
when
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
judge,
not
off
set
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
says
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
it
within
the
context
of
richmond
only.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it
means
both.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yeah
there
were
actual
pupils
within
these
three
counties
and
in
addition
there
were,
there
were
cases
in
other
counties
where
there
were
regional
black
schools
and
incidentally
mr.
justice
brennan
you
ought
to
remember
from
the
green
case
that
they
actually
bused
indians
across
the
line
too,
at
one
particular
time.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
the
nature
was
that
under
the
pupil
placement
law,
when
a
black
person
would
apply
to
go
to
school
in
richmond,
the
white
family
then
had
the
right
to
send
his
child
to
some
other
school.
he
would
then
make
an
application
to
those
schools
in
henrico
or
those
schools
in
chesterfield
and
they
would
have
take
him,
in
fact
the
testimony
[attempt
to
laughter]
says
that
if
for
some
reason
richmond
would
stand
up
and
say
no
you
cannot
do
that,
the
state
would
get
back
at
them
by
just
deducting
from
the
next
state
grant
check,
the
amount
of
the
tuition.
and
so
the
testimony
says
we
could
not
do
anything
about,
this
was
state
directed,
we
had
to
do
it
and
the
fact
is
that
these
children
would
cross
these
lines,
all
during
that
time
and
that
is
what
the
judge
found.
in
addition
now
in
these
counties
there
are
special
schools
like
the
science
schools
in
one
county,
the
children
go
across
that
line
and
nobody
gets
upset
and
it
is
only
when
it
comes
to
desegregating
the
school
that
this
line
all
of
a
sudden
becomes
the
most
sacrosanct
thing
in
the
world
and
we
just
do
not
think
that
under
your
cases
that
that
is
so.
and
we
also
cited
a
lot
of
cases
in
the
district
court
on
page
78
of
our
brief
and
i
think
it's
footnote
121
where
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts
have
repeatedly
ordered
that
there
would
be
an
interchange
of
students
if
that
was
the
only
way.
mr.
justice
white,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
[attempt
to
laughter]
when
you
have
a
line
which
is
this
ridiculous,
never
used,
then
under
those
circumstances,
we
can't
say
that,
that
becomes
an
absolute
bar,
and
this
case
is
just
that
simple.
now
as
i
said
before
that
i
think
that
the
real
issue
here
is
one
of
whether
the
discretion
was
properly
exercised
and
in
my
opening,
i
indicated
to
you
the
reason
why
i
thought
it
was
properly
exercised.
thank
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
it
will
take
me
twice
as
long
to
move
as
fast
as
mr.
solicitor
did?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh!
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
is
a
lot
of
difference.
federalism
is
important
and
no
lawyer
can
stand
up
here
and
say
that
when
you
are
involving
two
states,
the
rule
is
the
same
as
when
you
are
involving
school
districts.
the
constitution
specifically
provides
that
anytime
the
two
states
get
together,
there
has
to
be
a
congressional
compact
and
that's
just
completely
different
and
with
all
the
due
respect
it
is
nowhere
into
this
case
and
we
are
not
contending
that.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh!
i
certainly
don't.
i
really
--
well,
i
do,
yes
sir.
now
what
the
solicitor
general
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what
the
solicitor
general
says,
this
is
charlotte,
but
for
these
division
line.
now
he
did
not
tell
you
that
in
division
six
there
is
nothing
done
under
this
plan.
now
once
you
eliminate
division
six,
then
you
don't
have
the
752
square
miles
that
they
would
have
you
believe,
but
you
have
only
400
and
somewhat
miles.
that
is
less
than
what
you
had
in
swann
because
swann
was
over
500
and
mobile
was
1200
square
miles.
so
really
with
all
these
horribles
that
you
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
now
i
have
tried
to
argue
the
case
based
upon
the
record
and
mr.
kurland
with
all
due
respects
when
he
was
asked
about
the
record,
he
walked
away
from
the
record.
i
do
think
that
this
case
has
to
be
decided
on
record
and
contrary
to
what
mr.
kurland
said
about
findings
with
respect
to
residential
segregation,
there
is
a
finding,
at
206a
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
of
certiorari,
211a
and
indeed
on
572a
it's
the
one
finding
that
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
and
said
the
district
court
was
correct
and
he
was
not
off
setting.
now
secondly,
they
constantly
talk
about
these
systems
being
unitary
at
the
time
they
were
brought
on,
at
the
time
of
the
decree,
that
just
is
not
the
fact.
the
record
findings
are
to
the
contrary,
the
court
of
appeals
never
mentions
rules
52a,
it
never
discusses
the
evidence,
it
just
says,
i
assume
that
these
systems
are
unitary,
but
the
district
judge
and
i
referred
you
to
those
places
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
just
ask
you
to
read
and
that's
supported
by
the
record.
look
at
that
exhibit
and
you
will
find
that
these
schools
certainly
are
not
unitary.
that
there
are
all
black
schools,
there
are
white
schools
measured
by
any
test
you
wish
to
make.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
answer
affirmatively
is
yes,
as
loud
and
clear
i
could
make
it
mr.
chief
justice.
i
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
henrico.
i
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
chesterfield,
but
more
important
what
i
said,
that's
what
the
district
judge
found,
and
no
court
of
appeals
has
off
set
that
finding
and
it
seems
to
me
that
on
this
record
that's
the
way
this
case
has
to
be
decided
in
this
court.
now
they
talk
about
this
line
and
about
all
line.
i
think,
at
some
point,
somebody
should
tell
you
that
this
line
was
redrawn
in
1971
and
if
you
look
at
the
exhibit
book,
on
page
67a,
you
will
find
a
memorandum
from
the
state
board
of
education
saying
by
official
action
at
this
june
meeting,
the
state
board
of
education
established
school
divisions
as
per
the
attach
effective
at
noon
july
1,
1971.
now
the
district
judge
said,
and
he
found
as
a
fact
and
every
time
i
see
this
chart
as
mr.
kurland
puts
in
his
in
his
brief
i
say,
i
wish
i
had
put
it
in
there
because
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
now
here
you
have
a
state
agency,
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
setting
a
new
line.
it
sees
richmond
all
black,
it
sees
these
counties
all
white.
now
i
ask
you,
can
you
exercise
state
power
in
such
a
way
to
keep
that
black
on
play
there.
this
was
done
in
1971,
after
this
was
underway
in
the
final
hearing,
and
it
was
done
at
a
time
when
anyone
who
drew
that
line
knew
the
result
of
drawing
that
line
was
to
create
all
black
schools
and
all
white
schools.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
okay,
mr
chief
justice.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
at
the
luncheon
break
sir,
i
pointed
out
that
the
respondents
in
1971,
had
an
opportunity
to
redraw
these
lines
and
they
drew
them
in
the
same
place.
lest
there
be
any
doubt
about
that,
just
look
at
pages
228(a)
and
229(a)
of
the
appendix.
now
there
was
some
mentioning
about
white
flight.
once
again
we
have
a
finding
on
it.
the
judge
found
as
a
fact
that
between
1970
and
1972,
7,800
whites
students
or
39%
of
the
entire
white
student
population
of
richmond
left
the
school
system.
that’s
at
page
237(a)
of
the
appendix
and
in
the
record
it's
at
page
470(a).
now
there
was
a
talk
about
these
schools
and
i
think
it's
very
interesting
that
when
you
come
to
the
opposition
of
the
stay
or
try
and
grant
the
stay
as
the
judge
merhige
at
page
1347(a)
of
the
record,
the
lawyers
seeking
the
stay,
representing
the
state
board
of
education
and
the
superintendent
of
public
instructions,
the
attorney
general
of
this
great
commonwealth
of
virginia,
that
so
long
has
segregated
blacks,
says,
“the
evidence
indicates
that
richmond
school
buildings
are
old
and
obsolete
in
some
cases.
while
chesterfield
and
henrico
have
gone
forward
in
the
past
decade-and-a-half
of
the
aggressive
modern
building
program.”
now
we
also
heard
some
mentioning
which
i
really
think
comes
with
immigration
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
that
the
blacks
having
the
courage
to
seek
this
relief
somehow
should
be
criticized
because
of
the
question
of
white
control.
but
you
had
pointed
out
to
you
that
it
was
a
biracial
school
board
that
made
the
determination
to
seek
this
relief.
secondly
you
had
pointed
out
to
you
that
a
black
a
petitioner
asking
this
relief
and
i
really
think
it
comes
with
poor
grace
from
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
that
has
this
tremendous
history
of
segregation
and
penning
black
people
out
to
now
say
that
somehow
we
are
criticized
for
attempting
to
get
schools
which
comply
with
the
constitution,
that's
all
we
want,
and
not
to
have
schools
which
are
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir
and
as
mr
little
pointed
out
to
you
mr
chief
justice,
that
virginia
statue
permit
the
result
that
the
judge
are
brought
about
and
the
only
statue
which
he
didn't
follow
a
100%
was
the
statue
that
was
amended
in
1971
while
this
litigation
was
pending
and
the
record
makes
it
clear
on
page
906(a)
of
the
record
942(a)
of
the
record
and
944
that
the
legislature
sitting
in
richmond
knowing
that
this
lawsuit
was
pending,
then
sought
to
change
the
statue,
so
that
these
local
counties
would
have
to
consent.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
am
glad
you
asked
that
question.
our
position
is
clearly
that
once
we
establish
a
constitutional
violation
which
i
think
we
have
from
1871
until
today,
then
the
court
can
take
steps
to
end
the
violation
and
to
correct
the
situation
and
certainly
if
the
steps
they
take
are
those
that
are
consistent
with
state
law,
there
can't
be
any
criticism
particularly
when
you,
your
honor
in
the
davis
case,
indicated
that
once
there
is
a
violation
and
the
only
way
to
end
the
violation
is
to
ignore
a
state
statute
that
the
federal
court
has
the
duty
and
the
obligation
to
ignore
that
statute.
i
am
going
to
recall
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no,
no,
but
state
statutes
which
prevent
the
ending,
but
no,
state
statutes
are
not
fungible,
i
agree.
i
have
no
problem
with
that,
but
i
am
saying
that
this
state,
that
any
state
statute
that's
involved
here,
if
it
has
the
effect
of
preventing
effective
desegregation,
you
then
do
what
you
did
in
the
north
carolina
versus
swann
and
if
you
indulge
me,
you
know
on
page
46,
well,
you
said,
“just
as
the
race
of
students
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
a
constitutional
violation
has
occurred,
so
also
must
race
be
considered
in
formulating
a
remedy
to
forbid
at
this
stage
all
assignments
made
on
the
basis
for
deprived
school
authorities
of
the
two”
and
there
in
north
carolina
it
was
argued,
they
had
a
state
statute,
which
specifically
said
that
you
can't
sent
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that's
exactly
the
same
thing
here
your
honor.
look
at
this,
look
at
my
friend's
map,
that's
what
he
is
attempting
to
do.
he
is
attempting
to
freeze
permanently
that
situation
and
i
just
don't
think
that
a
federal
district
court
is
well
powered
to
permit
it
and
particularly
justice
rehnquist
when
you
asked
me
the
question,
i
stated
that
they
took
people
across
this
line
to
maintain
segregation,
now
when
you
ask
mr.
kurland
that,
he
agreed
with
me
and
i
do
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
certainly,
to
say
that
you
can't
do
it
to
get
an
effective
desegregation,
is
more
sophistication
that
at
least
i
have
and
i
don't.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well.
i
think
that,
that
is
slightly
a
different
situation.
that's
not
this
case,
but
i
would
say
that
after
checking,
i
would
find
much
greater
difficulty
urging
that
you
can
cross
the
district
line
to
go
into
maryland
because
once
again,
their
constitution
provision
dealing
with
how
you
set
up
a
district
and
with
the
(inaudible)
case
decided
in
19
--
other
case,
it's
a
different
question,
but
it's
not
the
question
we
have
here
and
it's
just
different,
your
honor.
now
if
i
had
that
case,
i
would
then
meet
the
issue
and
i
would
be
able
to
answer
the
question
but
i
think
it
is
a
completely
different
question.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
yes,
yes.
well,
that's
one
of
it.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
my
red
light
is
going
on.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
is
that
if
you
make
the
determination
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
you
could
not
go
beyond
that
division
line,
then
i
think
you
should
affirm
judge
merhige.
if
you
don't
because
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
you
reversed
an
order
then
which
you
do
all
the
time,
your
honor.
you
order
for
the
reinstatement
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
there
were
not
your
honor
and
what's
happened
here,
is
a
very
sophisticated
way
to
confuse
the
situation.
the
viable
racial
mix
appears
nowhere
in
the
principle
opinion
of
judge
merhige.
in
his
entire
opinion
and
that
part,
which
is
from
page
164a-263a,
thereafter
there
is
an
additional
part
of
the
opinion,
where
all
he
does
is
to
take
all
of
the
testimony
and
discuss
it
and
they
find
only
in
that
part;
you
cannot
find
in
what
he
said
his
opinion
was,
and
so
i
think
that
if
you
just
determine
that
that
line
which
was
a
bamboo
curtain
for
purposes
of
segregation,
if
that
become
an
iron
curtain,
you
should
reverse
and
reinstate
the
judgment
of
judge
merhige.
if
you
thought
you
should
send
it
back,
i
think
at
least,
under
your
other
cases,
you
should
say
when
it
goes
back
because
i
don't
think
you
should
think
it
should
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
at
least
the
merhgie
plan
should
go
into
effect
the
way
you
did
in
swann
until
such
time
as
relief
because
after
all
it's
been
20
years
and
i
do
hope
that
the
next
generation
at
least
will
get
our
constitutional
education.
thank
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
19
years
after
brown,
state
created
school
division
lines
which
were
bamboo
curtains
in
the
cause
of
school
segregation
in
virginia,
lines
which
were
freely
and
repeatedly
crossed
and
ignored
to
maintain
segregated
schools
in
virginia,
now
become
iron
curtains
constituting
an
absolute
bar
to
the
effective
desegregation
plan
before
the
court
below.
for
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
virginia
through
its
spate
school
officials,
its
legislature
and
its
school
division,
including
that
of
richmond,
repeatedly
and
consistently
violated
the
black
petitioner's
constitutional
right
to
attend
public
schools
free
from
state
sponsored
racial
segregation.
in
other
words,
the
question
here
is
whether
a
district
court
is
without
power
to
prove
a
desegregation
relief
plan,
solely
because
it
involves
inner
division
of
assignment
of
pupils
among
adjacent
divisions.
and
if
this
court
determines
that
that
power
does
exists,
was
there
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion
to
exercise
it
here
when
the
record
includes
undisturbed
findings
that;
one,
virginia
including
the
three
sub
--
the
three
school
divisions
here
involved,
repeatedly
ignored
the
division
lines
to
revert
to
preserve
segregated
schools.
second,
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
achieve
effective
and
complete
desegregation
within
the
confines
of
virginia
--
of
richmond
school
division
itself.
third,
that
repeated
unconstitutional
acts
and
intentional
delays
directed
by
virginia
created
this
situation.
fourth,
the
school
division
line
served
no
useful
administrative
or
educational
purpose
and
the
result
of
such
failure
would
to
be
to
have
black
and
white
schools
within
walking
distance
of
each
other.
in
addition,
the
two
adjoining
school
divisions
here
involved,
henrico
and
chesterfield,
were
themselves
operating
non-unitary
racial
system.
petitioners
in
number
72-550
are
black
school
children.
the
defendants
are
the
state
board
of
education,
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction,
the
three
division,
school
superintendents
who
under
virginia
law
incidentally
are
centrally
nominated.
the
legislative
bodies
of
richmond,
henrico
and
chesterfield
and
the
school
boards
of
these
three
divisions,
each
of
which
under
virginia
law
is
an
administrative
subdivision
of
the
state.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
under
virginia
law,
it’s
provided
that
the
state
board
of
education
makes
up
a
list
of
people
eligible
to
be
appointed
and
the
school
divisions
can
appoint
only
from
that
list.
and
in
fact,
the
virginia
law
provides
that
if
within
60
days
the
person
is
not
appointed
if
there
is
a
vacancy,
the
state
board
itself
makes
the
appointment
and
incidentally
in
this
case,
the
school’s
superintendent
of
the
division
of
chesterfield
was
appointed
in
that
manner.
he
was
appointed
by
the
state
because
chesterfield
within
60
days
had
not
made
the
appointment.
now
from
1871
until
the
time
of
the
brown
decision,
virginia’s
constitution,
its
statues
and
all
of
it’s
policy
making
authorities
compel
each
school
division
to
operate
racially
segregated
schools.
at
the
time
of
the
brown
decision,
the
school
population
of
the
richmond
division
was
43%
black
and
57%
white.
in
chesterfield,
it
was
21%
black
and
79%
white.
in
henrico,
it
was
11%
black
and
89%
white.
for
the
three
divisions
together,
however,
the
composite
figure
was
33.7%
black
and
66.3%
white.
and
as
i
stated
before
in
each
division
regardless
of
what
the
local
division
would
want
to
do,
by
state
law,
black
and
white
had
to
attend
wholly
separate
schools.
now
unfortunately,
brown
brought
no
change
whatsoever.
on
pages
18
through
22
of
our
brief,
we
recount
the
very
successful
state
actions
by
state
officials
with
school
division
cooperation
to
keep
virginia
schools
segregated
into
position,
then
a
statute
under
which
the
governor
would
takeover
any
school
which
voluntarily
or
by
quota
admitted
blacks,
then
a
pupil
placement
law
and
then
the
state
tuitions
laws.
now
the
pupil
placement
law
as
this
court
knows
was
particularly
effective.
as
stated
in
bradley,
it
took
out
of
the
hands
of
the
school
boards
and
school
superintendent
any
decision
relating
to
the
integration
of
the
school.
and
so
in
1961,
these
black
petitioners
brought
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
black
children
in
virginia
against
state
officials
and
quoting
the
richmond
school
division
to
be
admitted
to
white
schools
despite
the
provision
of
the
pupil
placement
law.
the
district
court
granted
limited
relief,
but
not
class
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
directing
class
reliefs.
the
commonwealth
and
the
richmond
school
division,
then
sought
to
invert
the
impact
of
this
decision
by
introducing
a
freedom
of
choice
plan.
this
plan
was
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
this
court
reversed
because
the
plan
failed
to
deal
with
desegregation
of
teachers.
it
was
now
1966,
12
years
after
brown,
a
consent
decree
was
added
into
involving
of
freedom
of
choice
plan,
placing
the
affirmative
duty
on
school
authorities
to
modify
free
choice,
if
it
did
not
result
in
effective
desegregation.
unfortunately,
segregation
continued,
but
the
school
officials
took
no
action
whatsoever.
for
this
reason,
the
black
petitioners
on
march
10,
1970
filed
for
further
relief
pursuant
to
this
court's
ruling
in
green.
on
that
date,
even
though
the
composite
racial
make
up
of
the
three
divisions
had
not
altered,
which
you
recall
i
said
33.7%
black
and
66.3%
white,
the
makeup
in
virginia
had
become
64.2%
black
and
35.8%
white,
while
chesterfield
had
become
9.5%
black,
90%
white
and
henrico,
8.1%
black
and
91.9%
white.
now
at
that
point,
this
is
1970
now,
just
two-and-a-half
years
ago,
the
richmond
school
board
admitted
that
it
had
been
and
it
was
in
violation
of
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
the
schools
were
still
rigidly
segregated
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
please
turn
to
pages
167
and
168
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
167
a,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
168
a
and
just
look
at
the
situation
and
this
is
1970.
of
the
seven
high
schools,
three
were
100%
black,
one
was
99.26%
white.
in
other
words,
six
of
the
seven
schools
by
any
test
you
could
make
were
clearly
racially
identifiable.
the
middle
schools,
six
of
the
seven
were
clearly
racially
identifiable.
the
elementary
schools,
almost
all
of
them
were
clearly
racially
identifiable.
the
faculty
and
staff
were
clearly
racially
identifiable.
now
i
am
confident,
now
this
is
16
years
after
brown,
i
am
confident
that
no
one
can
stand
up
before
the
bar
of
this
court
and
question
the
correctness
of
the
district
court's
resulting
finding
at
pages
168
a,
169
a
pardon
me,
where
the
court
says
that
the
schools
were
racially
segregated,
racially
identifiable
and
violative
of
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
now
frankly
we
find
it
impossible
to
characterize
such
contemporary
facts
as
“history
or
original
sin”
as
respondents
do
at
pages
47
and
73
of
that
brief.
at
that
point,
the
district
court's
job
was
attempt
to
see
that
the
school
board
would
produce
a
plan
which
would
effectively
desegregate
the
public
school.
the
richmond
school
board
continued
to
file
inadequate
interim
plan
which
were
approved
only
because
of
time
pressure
and
the
schools
would
have
to
open
at
the
time.
in
each
case,
the
court
specifically
found
that
these
interim
plans
did
not
conform
to
constitutional
requirements.
then
on
november
4,
1970,
the
richmond
school
board
stating
under
oath
that
it
was
impossible
to
desegregate
the
schools
in
the
context
of
richmond,
moved
to
join
the
adjacent
divisions
of
henrico
and
chesterfield
counties.
the
state
board
of
education
and
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instructions
and
at
that
time,
the
black
petitioners
filed
a
second
amended
complaint
which
again
asked
for
relief
on
behalf
of
all
children
throughout
virginia.
they
asked
that
the
adjoining
school
divisions
be
included
in
a
desegregation
plan
either
by
consolidation
or
by
contractual
arrangements.
now
after
trial,
and
i
wish
the
court
to
follow
me
through
these
findings,
that
i
really
saying
that
in
this
case,
unless
you
can
upset
these
findings
that
this
case
has
to
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
black
petitioners.
that
at
trial,
at
the
trial,
full
trial
now,
the
district
court
found
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
this
was
filed
in
1970,
your
honor
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
in
1970.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir,
that
was
not
done,
what
happened
was,
your
honor,
that
they
were
trying
to
come
up
with
an
effective
plan.
in
the
course
of
that
mr.
little
who
is
of
the
richmond
school
division
said
that
the
only
way
you
could
have
a
plan
would
be
that
you
involve
the
other
counties.
at
that
point
the
judge
in
a
letter
which
appears
i
think,
on
about
page
150a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
indicated,
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
here
and
we
want
the
lawyers
to
co-operate.
then
the
school
board
filed
the
motion
and
it's
attached
to
the
--
there
is
a
order
in
which
there
is
a
motion
to
recuse
the
judge
and
it's
attached
to
that
order,
your
honor.
it's
58
a,
is
the
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
this
once
again
of
the
petition,
your
honor,
and
it's
at
page
81.
if
you
read
the
letter
sir,
and
once
you
read
that
letter,
i
am
confident
that
you
will
not
conclude
that
that
was
an
invitation
on
part
of
anybody
to
file
a
claim.
in
other
words,
the
findings
were
that
one,
the
pupil
assignment
patterns
and
then
three
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
as
i
go
through,
i
will
give
them
to
you.
the
pupil
assignment
patterns
in
the
three
school
divisions
showed
great
disparity
in
1971
racial
composition,
making
both
individual
school
facilities
and
the
entire
three
systems
racially
identifiable.
he
said
that
the
richmond
system
is
identifiable
as
black
and
that
that
of
each
county
is
perceived
as
a
white
system.
that's
on
page
201a,
208a.
that
a
great
number
of
one
race
schools
had
recently
existed
and
i
repeat
some
still
exist,
that's
at
page
186a,
201a.
he
also
found
that
at
the
time
chesterfield
and
henrico
were
enjoined
and
at
the
close
of
the
record,
each
was
operating
a
non-unitary
school
system
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
that's
at
page
524a
of
the
record,
526a
of
the
record
with
respect
to
chesterfield
and
page
527a
of
the
record
and
529a
of
the
record
with
respect
to
henrico.
it
further
found
that
past
and
continuing
action
by
state
authorities
interfering
with
desegregation
that
a
constitutional
plan
for
the
city
and
for
the
counties
as
well
cannot
be
achieved
within
current
school
division
boundaries,
that
findings
are
at
237a,
207a
and
201a.
he
concluded
that
the
defendants
should
not
be
permitted
to
profit
by
self
created
problems
and
that's
at
page
237a.
finally
he
found
that
at
the
time
the
record
closed
each
division
still
operated
a
school
system
which
was
in
some
respect
non-unitary.
the
court
never
found,
as
respondents
would
have
you
believe
by
pages
8
of
their
brief
that
anyone
of
three
divisions
had
ever
achieved
a
unitary
status
and
i
ask
you
to
look
at
the
chart
in
the
appendix
to
the
court
opinion
which
shows
that
each
division
operates
racially
identifiable
school
and
the
chart
is
in
volume
ii,
beginning
on
page
524
where
he
takes
the
schools
of
chesterfield
county,
then
henrico
county
and
richmond
and
i
assure
when
you
will
examine
those,
you
will
find
that
in
each
instance
in
this
record
everyone
of
these
schools
were
racially
identifiable.
the
other
thing
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
attached
your
honor
to
petition
--
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it's
a
chart,
it
is
524,
your
honor.
white
and
--
with
respect
to
chesterfield
county
any
test
you
will
apply,
you
would
have
to
say
three
out
of
those
six
schools
are
identifiable
as
white.
now
another
thing
that
i
would
like
to
clear
up
in
this
case,
the
judge
never
found
and
we
don't
urge
that
the
absence
of
a
quota
gives
rise
to
constitutional
violation
and
i
would
just
ask
you
to
read
page
519a
of
the
record,
once
again
in
the
same
opinion,
i
mean
the
same,
the
opinion
which
is
in
the
appendix.
now
once
he
found
these
massive
constitutional
violations,
he
had
a
constitutional
duty
to
end
them
and
in
charlotte
the
swan
case,
in
davis
this
court
has
said
that
once
there
is
a
violation
the
court
should
take
all
steps
necessary
to
end
that
violation
and
to
end
the
effects
of
it.
now
the
only
reason
and
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
case
any
different
from
davis
and
swann
is
something
that
the
my
friends
tried
to
raise
namely
this
division
line.
and
i
stand
here
and
say
once
again,
that
in
order
to
maintain
segregated
schools,
this
line
was
never
observed.
students
freely
were
taken
back
and
forth
across
this
line.
you
will
find
from
this
record
now
for
example
that
the
kennedy
school
which
is
under
the
richmond
division
is
actually
situated
in
henrico
county
and
black
children,
kennedy
is
now
about
80%
black
and
if
you
look
at
pages,
8
of
our
brief,
we
set
out
a
table
for
you
on
page
eight
and
here
you
have
a
situation
where
kennedy
high
school
built
in
1967,
opened
as
a
black
school
now
over
80%
black,
in
fact
is
93%
black
as
of
now,
that
within
four
miles
of
that
school
is
a
henrico
high
school
which
is
4%
black.
now
that's
the
problem
that
the
district
judge
had
here.
he
looked
at
this
map
and
he
saw
that
you
had
a
array
in
the
richmond
school
division
of
black
schools
measured
by
any
test
that
you
want
to
measure,
tight
on
top
of
them,
outside
in
the
counties,
in
these
counties,
there
were
white
schools.
now
certainly
in
swann
what
you
did
was
to
approve
a
plan
which
said
that
you
should
desegregate
the
schools
and
that
you
send
students
by
contiguous
zones,
by
busing
to
these
various
places.
now
here
the
only
reason
is
this
line.
now
i
assure
you,
the
record
will
show
and
will
clearly
show,
this
line
is
an
arbitrary
line,
was
never
used
to
--
when
there
were
segregated
schools.
the
judge
found
out
at
page
193a
of
the
record
in
his
opinion.
also
in
the
record
at,
this
record
now
sir,
at
page
912,
this
testimony
that
under
the
state
tuition
law,
when
a
black
child
would
get
the
right
to
go
to
school
in
richmond
and
then
if
the
white
parent
didn't
like
it,
he
under
the
state
tuition
law
as
you
know
mr.
justice
white,
would
opt
out
and
go
some
place
else.
that
the
state
paid
the
tuition
and
the
white
child
went
out
of
the
county,
that's
all
in
912a
of
the
record.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
footnote
two
of
the
--
footnote
two
of
the
court
of
appeals,
says
this
is
not
busing
case.
the
record
is
clear
here
that
the
amount
of
busing
involved
here
is
less
than
it
was.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
not
in
this
case,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
irrelevant.
the
sole
issue
here
your
honor
is
that
when
a
judge
finds
as
a
fact
that
these
lines
have
been
repeatedly
ignored
in
the
course
of
segregation,
can
you
--
do
they
then
become
an
iron
curtain
when
you
attempt
to
integrate
the
school,
particularly
when
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
judge,
not
off
set
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
says
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
it
within
the
context
of
richmond
only.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it
means
both.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yeah
there
were
actual
pupils
within
these
three
counties
and
in
addition
there
were,
there
were
cases
in
other
counties
where
there
were
regional
black
schools
and
incidentally
mr.
justice
brennan
you
ought
to
remember
from
the
green
case
that
they
actually
bused
indians
across
the
line
too,
at
one
particular
time.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
the
nature
was
that
under
the
pupil
placement
law,
when
a
black
person
would
apply
to
go
to
school
in
richmond,
the
white
family
then
had
the
right
to
send
his
child
to
some
other
school.
he
would
then
make
an
application
to
those
schools
in
henrico
or
those
schools
in
chesterfield
and
they
would
have
take
him,
in
fact
the
testimony
[attempt
to
laughter]
says
that
if
for
some
reason
richmond
would
stand
up
and
say
no
you
cannot
do
that,
the
state
would
get
back
at
them
by
just
deducting
from
the
next
state
grant
check,
the
amount
of
the
tuition.
and
so
the
testimony
says
we
could
not
do
anything
about,
this
was
state
directed,
we
had
to
do
it
and
the
fact
is
that
these
children
would
cross
these
lines,
all
during
that
time
and
that
is
what
the
judge
found.
in
addition
now
in
these
counties
there
are
special
schools
like
the
science
schools
in
one
county,
the
children
go
across
that
line
and
nobody
gets
upset
and
it
is
only
when
it
comes
to
desegregating
the
school
that
this
line
all
of
a
sudden
becomes
the
most
sacrosanct
thing
in
the
world
and
we
just
do
not
think
that
under
your
cases
that
that
is
so.
and
we
also
cited
a
lot
of
cases
in
the
district
court
on
page
78
of
our
brief
and
i
think
it's
footnote
121
where
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts
have
repeatedly
ordered
that
there
would
be
an
interchange
of
students
if
that
was
the
only
way.
mr.
justice
white,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
[attempt
to
laughter]
when
you
have
a
line
which
is
this
ridiculous,
never
used,
then
under
those
circumstances,
we
can't
say
that,
that
becomes
an
absolute
bar,
and
this
case
is
just
that
simple.
now
as
i
said
before
that
i
think
that
the
real
issue
here
is
one
of
whether
the
discretion
was
properly
exercised
and
in
my
opening,
i
indicated
to
you
the
reason
why
i
thought
it
was
properly
exercised.
thank
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
it
will
take
me
twice
as
long
to
move
as
fast
as
mr.
solicitor
did?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh!
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
is
a
lot
of
difference.
federalism
is
important
and
no
lawyer
can
stand
up
here
and
say
that
when
you
are
involving
two
states,
the
rule
is
the
same
as
when
you
are
involving
school
districts.
the
constitution
specifically
provides
that
anytime
the
two
states
get
together,
there
has
to
be
a
congressional
compact
and
that's
just
completely
different
and
with
all
the
due
respect
it
is
nowhere
into
this
case
and
we
are
not
contending
that.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh!
i
certainly
don't.
i
really
--
well,
i
do,
yes
sir.
now
what
the
solicitor
general
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what
the
solicitor
general
says,
this
is
charlotte,
but
for
these
division
line.
now
he
did
not
tell
you
that
in
division
six
there
is
nothing
done
under
this
plan.
now
once
you
eliminate
division
six,
then
you
don't
have
the
752
square
miles
that
they
would
have
you
believe,
but
you
have
only
400
and
somewhat
miles.
that
is
less
than
what
you
had
in
swann
because
swann
was
over
500
and
mobile
was
1200
square
miles.
so
really
with
all
these
horribles
that
you
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
now
i
have
tried
to
argue
the
case
based
upon
the
record
and
mr.
kurland
with
all
due
respects
when
he
was
asked
about
the
record,
he
walked
away
from
the
record.
i
do
think
that
this
case
has
to
be
decided
on
record
and
contrary
to
what
mr.
kurland
said
about
findings
with
respect
to
residential
segregation,
there
is
a
finding,
at
206a
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
of
certiorari,
211a
and
indeed
on
572a
it's
the
one
finding
that
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
and
said
the
district
court
was
correct
and
he
was
not
off
setting.
now
secondly,
they
constantly
talk
about
these
systems
being
unitary
at
the
time
they
were
brought
on,
at
the
time
of
the
decree,
that
just
is
not
the
fact.
the
record
findings
are
to
the
contrary,
the
court
of
appeals
never
mentions
rules
52a,
it
never
discusses
the
evidence,
it
just
says,
i
assume
that
these
systems
are
unitary,
but
the
district
judge
and
i
referred
you
to
those
places
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
just
ask
you
to
read
and
that's
supported
by
the
record.
look
at
that
exhibit
and
you
will
find
that
these
schools
certainly
are
not
unitary.
that
there
are
all
black
schools,
there
are
white
schools
measured
by
any
test
you
wish
to
make.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
answer
affirmatively
is
yes,
as
loud
and
clear
i
could
make
it
mr.
chief
justice.
i
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
henrico.
i
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
chesterfield,
but
more
important
what
i
said,
that's
what
the
district
judge
found,
and
no
court
of
appeals
has
off
set
that
finding
and
it
seems
to
me
that
on
this
record
that's
the
way
this
case
has
to
be
decided
in
this
court.
now
they
talk
about
this
line
and
about
all
line.
i
think,
at
some
point,
somebody
should
tell
you
that
this
line
was
redrawn
in
1971
and
if
you
look
at
the
exhibit
book,
on
page
67a,
you
will
find
a
memorandum
from
the
state
board
of
education
saying
by
official
action
at
this
june
meeting,
the
state
board
of
education
established
school
divisions
as
per
the
attach
effective
at
noon
july
1,
1971.
now
the
district
judge
said,
and
he
found
as
a
fact
and
every
time
i
see
this
chart
as
mr.
kurland
puts
in
his
in
his
brief
i
say,
i
wish
i
had
put
it
in
there
because
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
now
here
you
have
a
state
agency,
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
setting
a
new
line.
it
sees
richmond
all
black,
it
sees
these
counties
all
white.
now
i
ask
you,
can
you
exercise
state
power
in
such
a
way
to
keep
that
black
on
play
there.
this
was
done
in
1971,
after
this
was
underway
in
the
final
hearing,
and
it
was
done
at
a
time
when
anyone
who
drew
that
line
knew
the
result
of
drawing
that
line
was
to
create
all
black
schools
and
all
white
schools.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
okay,
mr
chief
justice.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
at
the
luncheon
break
sir,
i
pointed
out
that
the
respondents
in
1971,
had
an
opportunity
to
redraw
these
lines
and
they
drew
them
in
the
same
place.
lest
there
be
any
doubt
about
that,
just
look
at
pages
228(a)
and
229(a)
of
the
appendix.
now
there
was
some
mentioning
about
white
flight.
once
again
we
have
a
finding
on
it.
the
judge
found
as
a
fact
that
between
1970
and
1972,
7,800
whites
students
or
39%
of
the
entire
white
student
population
of
richmond
left
the
school
system.
that’s
at
page
237(a)
of
the
appendix
and
in
the
record
it's
at
page
470(a).
now
there
was
a
talk
about
these
schools
and
i
think
it's
very
interesting
that
when
you
come
to
the
opposition
of
the
stay
or
try
and
grant
the
stay
as
the
judge
merhige
at
page
1347(a)
of
the
record,
the
lawyers
seeking
the
stay,
representing
the
state
board
of
education
and
the
superintendent
of
public
instructions,
the
attorney
general
of
this
great
commonwealth
of
virginia,
that
so
long
has
segregated
blacks,
says,
“the
evidence
indicates
that
richmond
school
buildings
are
old
and
obsolete
in
some
cases.
while
chesterfield
and
henrico
have
gone
forward
in
the
past
decade-and-a-half
of
the
aggressive
modern
building
program.”
now
we
also
heard
some
mentioning
which
i
really
think
comes
with
immigration
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
that
the
blacks
having
the
courage
to
seek
this
relief
somehow
should
be
criticized
because
of
the
question
of
white
control.
but
you
had
pointed
out
to
you
that
it
was
a
biracial
school
board
that
made
the
determination
to
seek
this
relief.
secondly
you
had
pointed
out
to
you
that
a
black
a
petitioner
asking
this
relief
and
i
really
think
it
comes
with
poor
grace
from
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
that
has
this
tremendous
history
of
segregation
and
penning
black
people
out
to
now
say
that
somehow
we
are
criticized
for
attempting
to
get
schools
which
comply
with
the
constitution,
that's
all
we
want,
and
not
to
have
schools
which
are
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir
and
as
mr
little
pointed
out
to
you
mr
chief
justice,
that
virginia
statue
permit
the
result
that
the
judge
are
brought
about
and
the
only
statue
which
he
didn't
follow
a
100%
was
the
statue
that
was
amended
in
1971
while
this
litigation
was
pending
and
the
record
makes
it
clear
on
page
906(a)
of
the
record
942(a)
of
the
record
and
944
that
the
legislature
sitting
in
richmond
knowing
that
this
lawsuit
was
pending,
then
sought
to
change
the
statue,
so
that
these
local
counties
would
have
to
consent.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
am
glad
you
asked
that
question.
our
position
is
clearly
that
once
we
establish
a
constitutional
violation
which
i
think
we
have
from
1871
until
today,
then
the
court
can
take
steps
to
end
the
violation
and
to
correct
the
situation
and
certainly
if
the
steps
they
take
are
those
that
are
consistent
with
state
law,
there
can't
be
any
criticism
particularly
when
you,
your
honor
in
the
davis
case,
indicated
that
once
there
is
a
violation
and
the
only
way
to
end
the
violation
is
to
ignore
a
state
statute
that
the
federal
court
has
the
duty
and
the
obligation
to
ignore
that
statute.
i
am
going
to
recall
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no,
no,
but
state
statutes
which
prevent
the
ending,
but
no,
state
statutes
are
not
fungible,
i
agree.
i
have
no
problem
with
that,
but
i
am
saying
that
this
state,
that
any
state
statute
that's
involved
here,
if
it
has
the
effect
of
preventing
effective
desegregation,
you
then
do
what
you
did
in
the
north
carolina
versus
swann
and
if
you
indulge
me,
you
know
on
page
46,
well,
you
said,
“just
as
the
race
of
students
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
a
constitutional
violation
has
occurred,
so
also
must
race
be
considered
in
formulating
a
remedy
to
forbid
at
this
stage
all
assignments
made
on
the
basis
for
deprived
school
authorities
of
the
two”
and
there
in
north
carolina
it
was
argued,
they
had
a
state
statute,
which
specifically
said
that
you
can't
sent
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that's
exactly
the
same
thing
here
your
honor.
look
at
this,
look
at
my
friend's
map,
that's
what
he
is
attempting
to
do.
he
is
attempting
to
freeze
permanently
that
situation
and
i
just
don't
think
that
a
federal
district
court
is
well
powered
to
permit
it
and
particularly
justice
rehnquist
when
you
asked
me
the
question,
i
stated
that
they
took
people
across
this
line
to
maintain
segregation,
now
when
you
ask
mr.
kurland
that,
he
agreed
with
me
and
i
do
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
certainly,
to
say
that
you
can't
do
it
to
get
an
effective
desegregation,
is
more
sophistication
that
at
least
i
have
and
i
don't.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well.
i
think
that,
that
is
slightly
a
different
situation.
that's
not
this
case,
but
i
would
say
that
after
checking,
i
would
find
much
greater
difficulty
urging
that
you
can
cross
the
district
line
to
go
into
maryland
because
once
again,
their
constitution
provision
dealing
with
how
you
set
up
a
district
and
with
the
(inaudible)
case
decided
in
19
--
other
case,
it's
a
different
question,
but
it's
not
the
question
we
have
here
and
it's
just
different,
your
honor.
now
if
i
had
that
case,
i
would
then
meet
the
issue
and
i
would
be
able
to
answer
the
question
but
i
think
it
is
a
completely
different
question.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
yes,
yes.
well,
that's
one
of
it.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
my
red
light
is
going
on.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
is
that
if
you
make
the
determination
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
you
could
not
go
beyond
that
division
line,
then
i
think
you
should
affirm
judge
merhige.
if
you
don't
because
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
you
reversed
an
order
then
which
you
do
all
the
time,
your
honor.
you
order
for
the
reinstatement
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
there
were
not
your
honor
and
what's
happened
here,
is
a
very
sophisticated
way
to
confuse
the
situation.
the
viable
racial
mix
appears
nowhere
in
the
principle
opinion
of
judge
merhige.
in
his
entire
opinion
and
that
part,
which
is
from
page
164a-263a,
thereafter
there
is
an
additional
part
of
the
opinion,
where
all
he
does
is
to
take
all
of
the
testimony
and
discuss
it
and
they
find
only
in
that
part;
you
cannot
find
in
what
he
said
his
opinion
was,
and
so
i
think
that
if
you
just
determine
that
that
line
which
was
a
bamboo
curtain
for
purposes
of
segregation,
if
that
become
an
iron
curtain,
you
should
reverse
and
reinstate
the
judgment
of
judge
merhige.
if
you
thought
you
should
send
it
back,
i
think
at
least,
under
your
other
cases,
you
should
say
when
it
goes
back
because
i
don't
think
you
should
think
it
should
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
at
least
the
merhgie
plan
should
go
into
effect
the
way
you
did
in
swann
until
such
time
as
relief
because
after
all
it's
been
20
years
and
i
do
hope
that
the
next
generation
at
least
will
get
our
constitutional
education.
thank
you.
