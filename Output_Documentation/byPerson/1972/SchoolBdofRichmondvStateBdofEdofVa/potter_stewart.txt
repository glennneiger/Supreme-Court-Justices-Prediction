id
that
the
school
superintendents,
mr.
coleman,
are
centrally
nominated?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
the
amended
complaint
was
filed,
when?
justice
potter
stewart
1970
still.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
done
in
response
to
an
implicit
invitation
by
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
school
divisions
are
there
now
in
virginia?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
there
how
many
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
19
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
part
of
the
city
was
recently
annexed,
the
part
of
whole
school
district?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
taken
from
chesterfield.
justice
potter
stewart
there
seems
to
be
some
question
about
that?
is
it
been
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
now
three
four
times
that
all
three
of
these
systems
were
desegregated
and
unitary
and
were
long
before
this
order
was
entered?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
that
there
is
some
disagreement
just
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
least
to
--
that
the
factual
–
between
you
and
your
brothers
on
the
other
side,
is
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
like
to
be
know
about
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
judge
merhige
in
his
very
long
opinion
and
i
--
that
just
wasn't
explicitly
clear,
but
i
drew
from
what
he
said
that
in
his
view
neither
one
of
these
systems
was
unitary
and
desegregated,
that
each
one
of
them
showed
vestiges
of
an
officially
segregated
system
and
i
just
agree
with
that,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
university
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
if
you
did
have
a
gray
spot
within
–
the
gray,
so
called
gray
school
that
is
0-19.9%
within
richmond
that
would
be
evidence
of
a
segregated
system
within
richmond.
justice
potter
stewart
but
surely
the
petitioners
have,
i
mean,
the
respondents
have
--
the
petitioners
have
shown
more
than
that.
they've
shown
that
as
a
matter
of
state,
basic
state
law,
there
was
officially
imposed
segregation
in
the
public
schools
throughout
virginia,
until
1954
and
that
thereafter
there
was
a
history
of
17
years
of
resistance
to
the
constitutional
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
brown
against
board
of
education
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
throughout
the
state
of
virginia
and
including
specifically
and
explicitly
these
three
school
districts,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
with
respect
to
the
county
high
school,
the
richmond
school
district
acquired
the
land
with
its
money
and
built
the
school?
justice
potter
stewart
city
of
richmond?
justice
potter
stewart
you
understand
by
the
meaning
of
the
word
viable
in
this
phrase.
i
thought
it
made
a
make
up
of
school
population
that
would
be
stable,
that
would
not
have
inherent
in
it,
the
probability
of
leading
to
all
black
and
all
white
school?
justice
potter
stewart
surely
the
white
black
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
context
of
the
richmond
metropolitan
area
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
had
understood
the
testimony
basically
to
be
directed
to
the
facts,
the
demographic
facts
of
this
metropolitan
area
which
is
basically
two
thirds
white
and
one
third
negro?

the
