mr.

chief

e.
burger
oh
you
may
proceed
unless
you
need
it
at
the
out
set.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
put
our
finger
on
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
put
our
finger
on
that
in
the
appendix
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
have
got
the
right
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
little.
mr.
kurland.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
use
the
term
racially
identifiable
schools,
precisely
what
do
you
mean,
taking
richmond?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
judge
merhige's
finding
on
that
precise
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
probably
you
should
come
back
to
that
later,
and
not
delay
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kurland.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
saying
mr.
solicitor
general
that
boundary
lines
might
be
disregarded
to
achieve
some
objectives,
but
they
may
not
be
disregarded
to
achieve
racial
balance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
if
you
wish
to
finish
we'll
make
an
adjustment
accordingly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
coleman
we
will
enlarge
the
time
of
the
rebuttal
by
three
minutes.
so
you
work
that
out
the
way
you
wish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
put
it
in
different
terms.
do
you
say
that
within
the
city
of
richmond
today
they
are
operating
a
dual
school
system
in
terms
that
we
used
green
and
paraphrased?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
that
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr
coleman
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
state
of
virginia
decided
that
it
was
awkward
to
try
to
have
these
two
counties
and
the
city
of
richmond
function
for
administrative
purposes
only
in
the
field
of
education
and
decided
to
legislate
an
annexation
or
however
they
do
it
in
virginia.
this
would
be
one
way
of
accomplishing
this
process,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
it
follows,
that
if
state
law
permits
something
that
then
--
that's
constitutional
authority
in
the
courts
to
reach
the
same
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
state
statutes
aren't
fungible
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
state
statute
would
have
frozen
the
statute
of
the
school
permanently,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
coleman,
you
answered
justice
blackmun
rather
vehemently
when
he
put
the
question
to
you
about
state
lines,
let
me
try
to
be
hypothetical,
perhaps
not
so
hypothetical,
nearer
home,
nearer
where
we
are.
you
are
familiar
with
the
problems
in
the
district
of
columbia
over
the
years.
it
has
been
suggested
publicly
and
privately
from
time
to
time
that
the
state
lines
of
virginia
and
maryland
should
be
ignored
and
that
the
metropolitan
area
of
washington,
should
be
treated
just
as
the
court
has
treated
a
metropolitan
area
of
richmond.
would
your
response
to
that
be
the
same
as
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
coleman,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
