justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kurland,
in
the
richmond's
area
i
did
not
see
any
gray
spot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
gray,
according
to
the
chart
there
and
you
have
a
unitary
system
and
not
one
single
gray
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
--
is
that
map
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
a
unitary
system?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
not
care
whether
you
look
at
it
one
way
or
the
other,
but
as
i
look
at
it,
frankly
all
of
the
gray
ones
are
outside
and
all
the
black
ones
are
inside,
by
sheer
accident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
of
the
findings
of
judge
merhige
were
upset
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
correct
–
oh!
excuse
me
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
disagree
with
opinion,
but
did
they
do
anything
with
the
findings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
state
imposed
segregation
doesn't
bring
about
segregated
housing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
did
have
state
segregated
schools?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
have
restrictive
covenants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
were
there
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
imply,
to
say
the
state
of
virginia
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
the
record
doesn't
show
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
record
does
show
that
despite
the
decision
of
this
court,
richmond
compelled
by
the
state,
defied
it
for
17
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
not
before
the
suit
was
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
one
on
page
169,
where
you
say
the
present
pattern
is
the
reflection
of
the
past
racial
discrimination
contributed
in
part
by
local,
state,
and
federal
government.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
you
pulled
this
out
of
clear
blue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
kennedy
high
school?
they
didn't
have
nay
trouble
with
the
line
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
kennedy
outside
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
didn't
have
any
trouble
with
the
county
line
on
that,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
understand
the
richmond
school
board
is
in
favor
of
this
plan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
yes,
so
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
my
only
point
is
i
thought
you
could
make
–
they
stressed
on
we
shouldn't
cross
this
county
line?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
was
the
police
power
over
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall

there
any
thing
in

richmond?
justice
thurgood
