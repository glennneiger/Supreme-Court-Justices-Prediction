mr.
george
b.
little
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
marshal
is
bringing
an
exhibit
in
which
you
would
prefer
that
i
--
mr.
george
b.
little
alright.
as
mr.
coleman
stated,
the
richmond
school
board
an
arm
of
the
state
of
virgina
conceded
that
its
schools
were
not
being
operated
in
accordance
with
constitutional
requirements.
in
addition
this
biracial
board,
consisting
of
four
whites
and
three
blacks,
is
unanimous
in
it's
belief
that
there
can
be
no
elimination
of
black
and
white
schools,
absent
assignment
of
pupils
across
existing
lines.
i
would
like
to
capsule
four
aspects
of
this
case
underlying
this
position.
a
brief
word
on
the
constitutional
violation,
discussion
of
the
precise
issue,
a
more
detailed
review
of
the
evidence
which
shows
the
lack
of
sanctity
in
these
school
division
lines
and
finally
key
aspects
of
the
particular
relief
decree.
coming
to
the
constitutional
violation,
the
mere
fact
that
a
dual
school
system
was
still
flourishing
in
richmond,
16
years
after
brown,
provides
the
nexus
for
the
relief
decree.
the
only
question
confronting
the
district
court
from
the
first
day
of
the
reopening
of
this
protracted
litigation
was
how
to
remedy
this
persistent
and
deliberately
deferred
perpetuation
of
a
dual
school
system.
this
is
a
remedy
case.
we
do
not
have
to
search
for
a
constitutional
violation.
this
search
for
an
effective
remedy
provides
the
lens
through
which
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
actions
of
the
district
court
must
be
viewed.
the
precise
issue
is
rather
narrow.
if
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
approving
a
richmond
school
board
desegregation
plan,
which
involved
assignments
of
pupils
across
these
lines.
this
concept
of
inter-divisional
assignments
constituted
the
essential
ingredient
in
both
of
the
alternative
forms
of
relief
sought,
consolidation
was
not
the
only
relief
sought.
the
first
was
a
contractual
interchange
between
the
existing
school
divisions
fully
authorized
by
state
law.
the
second
was
a
consolidation
of
these
school
divisions
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
state
law.
our
position
is
that
the
action
of
the
lower
court
was
dictated
on
this
record
by
a
sound
application
of
the
all
too
familiar
remedial
guidelines
previously
established
by
this
court.
under
these
decisions,
there
is
only
one
test,
that's
effectiveness,
effectiveness
is
the
key.
no
one
can
stand
before
the
bar
of
this
court
and
argue
that
the
richmond
school
board
plan
is
not
obviously
more
effective
than
the
present
plans
in
operation
in
richmond
or
henrico
or
chesterfield.
the
respondents
and
the
government
has
studiously
avoided
any
discussion
of
effectiveness
which
we
as
understand
it
is
the
heart
of
brown,
green,
swann,
davis
and
other
decisions
of
this
court.
the
district
court,
let
me
go
back.
what
we
analyzed
is
the
position
of
the
respondents'
to
be
and
the
government
apparently
is
it
not
withstanding
these
guidelines
which
are
so
clear
and
explicit,
regardless
of
consequences,
regardless
of
the
feasibility
of
the
means
to
overcome
these
lines,
regardless
of
the
past
treatment
of
these
lines
by
the
state
of
virgina,
these
lines
impose
a
geographical
limitation
on
the
powers
of
a
chancellor
seeking
to
remedy
an
admitted
constitutional
violation.
the
district
court
very
carefully
considered
the
importance
which
state
authorities,
local
authorities
had
attached
to
these
lines.
he
concluded
that
there
was
no
overriding
state
interest
in
either
restricting
the
assignment
of
pupils
to
the
political
subdivision
in
which
they
reside
or
in
requiring
each
political
subdivision
to
operate
it's
own
school
system.
he
also
concluded
from
a
review
of
all
of
the
facts,
that
these
lines
did
constitute
barriers
to
any
effective
relief
for
these
plaintiffs.
now
what
evidence
supports
these
findings?
it
falls
into
three
areas.
first
we
don't
have
to
look
for,
we
simply
only
have
to
go
to
the
code
of
virgina,
the
state
laws.
we
next
can
go
to
the
expressed
policies
of
the
state
board
of
education,
the
father,
we
are
a
child
in
virginia.
the
power
over
schools
is
in
the
state,
this
is
a
state
violation.
richmond
did
not
of
its
own
initiative
set
up
a
dual
school
system.
we
can
go
to
the
established
policies
of
the
board
and
finally
we
can
go
to
the
history
of
past
practices.
let's
come
to
the
laws.
our
code
expressly
for
many
years
has
set
out
a
framework
for
the
operation
of
a
school
division
consisting
of
two
or
more
separate
and
distinct
political
sub-divisions.
our
state
law
for
years
and
we
have
all
used
it,
has
expressly
provided
for
the
operation
of
joint
schools
for
any
educational
need.
our
state
law,
and
we
have
all
engaged
in
it,
not
all,
but
many
divisions
have
specifically
provides
for
the
contractual
interchange
of
pupils
between
separate
political
sub-divisions.
these,
the
very
existence
of
these
laws
totally
belongs
any
overriding
state
interest
in
restricting
the
assignment
of
pupils
to
the
political
sub-division
in
which
they
live,
but
they
even
do
something
else
under
the
remedial
guidelines
of
this
court,
a
fair
interpretation
of
it.
they
suggested
alternatives
which
a
district
court
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
to
end
segregation
and
its
effects
had
to
consider.
let's
come
to
state
board
policies.
the
state
board
of
education
has
encouraged
consolidations
of
separate
political
sub-divisions
into
one
school
division
for
almost
30
years.
in
1944,
it
approved
and
excepted
in
principle
a
plan
which
had
as
its
objective
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
school
divisions
then
in
existence
in
virginia.
at
that
time,
we
had
a
110
and
for
the
most
part
each
represented
a
separate
political
sub-division.
this
plan
which
was
endorsed
by
our
own
state
board
of
education,
had
as
its
objective
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
school
divisions
from
a
110
to
40
or
50,
which
would
have
necessarily
involved
combining
the
separate
political
sub-divisions
into
a
single
school
division.
as
recently
as
1969,
again
in
a
statement
expressing
the
desire
of
the
state
board
statement
that
consolidation
be
considered
for
educational
needs,
expressly
stated
that
“political
boundary
lines
do
not
necessarily
conform
to
educational
needs.”
this
is
not
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
said.
this
is
what
our
own
state
board
of
education
has
recognized.
mr.
george
b.
little
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
this
is
on
richmond
school
board
exhibit
82.
it's
in
the
exhibit
appendix
on
page
63
and
64.
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
last
two
sentences,
“the
state
board
therefore
has
favored
in
principle
the
consolidations
of
school
divisions
with
the
view
to
creating
administrative
units
appropriate
to
modern
educational
needs.”
mr.
george
b.
little
i
beg
your
pardon,
this
is
the
exhibit
appendix.
this
is
the
thin
brown
appendix.
it's
hard
to
identify
these
sir.
64,
in
particular,
the
language
i
am
quoting.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
second
paragraph,
“has
favored
in
principle
consolidation
of
school
divisions
with
a
view
to
creating
administrative
units
appropriate
to
modern
educational
needs.
the
board
regrets
the
current
trends
to
the
contrary,
pursuant
to
which
some
counties
and
newly
formed
cities
have
sought
separate
divisional
status
based
on
political
boundary
lines
which
do
not
necessarily
conform
to
educational
needs.”
not
only
the
state
board
but
this
record
contains
testimony
from
some
of
the
more
outstanding
educational
experts
of
the
country
which
agree
with
the
state
board,
that
political
boundary
lines
are
of
no
significance
in
the
area
of
education.
now
so
much
for
the
state
board
policies,
let
me
pass
on
--
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
george
b.
little
approximately,
130.
mr.
george
b.
little
a
110
--
mr.
george
b.
little
right
sir.
more
towns
have
attained
status
such
as
this
court
saw
and
inquired,
that
is
the
reason
for
the
increase.
the
objectives
of
that
plan
were
never
carried
out,
but
i
am
urging
it
to
show
what
the
policy
of
the
state
board
has
been.
let's
come
to
the
past
practices
of
these
with
respect
to
these
lines.
the
district
court
quite
popularly
found
that
the
state
officials
and
local
officials
had
historically
used
principles
of
consolidation
and
inter-divisional
assignment
of
pupils
in
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
regional
schools
for
blacks,
joint
schools
for
blacks
and
joint
schools
for
other
educational
needs.
these
regional
schools
for
blacks
consisted
of
as
many
as
four
separate
political
subdivisions,
encompassing
an
area
as
large
as
1700
square
miles,
requiring
the
children
to
spend
the
night
at
these
schools
because
of
the
extreme
travel
distances
involved.
these
schools
operated
in
virgina
and
the
last
one
didn't
close
as
this
court
might
have
anticipated
in
1955,
it
closed
in
1968.
there
is
a
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
finance
problems
arose
as
a
result
of
one
regional
school
being
supported
by
four,
as
many
as
four
or
five
separate
political
sub-divisions.
now
what
about
the
use
of
inter-divisional
assignments?
there
is
a
statute
on
our
books,
it's
still
on
the
books,
section
22,
115
found
on
our
brief
but
also
in
the
petition
appendix
at
194
which
in
1960,
the
state
declared
it
a
matter
of
public
policy
of
the
state
to
encourage
students
to
participate
in
programs
which
would
require
them
to
attend
schools
in
political
sub-divisions
other
than
the
one
in
which
they
reside.
the
more
significant
in
order
to
perpetuate
segregation,
not
pre-brown,
but
after
brown
the
50s,
the
late
60s,
thousands
of
blacks
were
involuntarily
shoved
across
these
so-called
sacred
lines
for
the
sole
purpose
of
perpetuating
segregation
in
defiance
of
this
court
and
in
defiance
of
the
affirmative
duty
on
school
authorities
to
end
discrimination.
now
is
this
all
history,
what's
happening
today?
let's
come
to
richmond,
if
we
can.
mr.
coleman
mentioned
kennedy
high
school.
this
black
line
irregularly
shaped,
is
the
city
limit
of
richmond.
the
only
schools
shown
on
the
map
are
those
within
one
to
three
miles
of
that
line,
this
one
school
might
be
a
little
more
than
three
miles.
kennedy
high
school,
the
blacks
in
richmond
historically
and
today
live
in
the
eastern
portion
of
the
city
to
south
central
portion,
this
is
the
black
part
of
the
city.
the
lily
white
area
is
in
the
western
part
and
part
of
the
southern.
kennedy
high
school
right
here,
is
a
richmond
school
opened
in
1967.
it
is
located
entirely
in
henrico,
county.
it
opened
as
an
all
black
school
and
everyday
since
it
is
opened,
1500
children
cross
this
so-called
iron
curtain,
attend
kennedy,
leave
that
school
and
cross
that
line
again
to
go
home.
mr.
george
b.
little
not
that
we
know
of
sir.
we
did
discover
in
one
of
the
schools
that
this
henrico
child
by
giving
a
false
address
had
enrolled,
i
am
not
sure
of
this,
but
it
was
in
armstrong
high
school.
on
fairfield
court,
is
another
richmond
school,
it's
an
elementary
school,
historically
a
black
school.
that
lies
partly
in
the
county
and
partly
in
the
city.
it
enrolls
about
560
students.
each
day
of
their
lives
they
cross
the
line
to
go
to
school,
they
probably
cross
the
line
several
times
during
the
day,
during
the
school
because
the
line
goes
right
through
the
school
building.
so
far
as
crossing
lines
in
the
past,
as
recently
as
1969,
henrico
was
operating
this
school
right
up
here
in
the
extreme
northern
parts
of
the
county.
they
do
claim
to
be
lovers
of
neighborhood
schools,
have
a
neighborhood
school
for
this
school
consisting
of
the
entire
henrico
county.
students
from
the
eastern
most
portion
of
henrico
to
get
to
that
school,
had
to
go
into
the
city
across
this
great
line
through
the
city
outside
the
line
again,
up
here.
that's
how
sacred
the
lines
were.
at
the
present
time,
henrico,
richmond,
chesterfield,
operate
joint
schools
for
educational
needs.
the
location
of
the
maths
science
center
referred
to
by
mr.
coleman
is
right
here.
the
school
for
--
i
beg
your
pardon
this
school
right
here.
in
1970-1971
approximately,
it
varies
within
the
1000
or
1500,
approximately
10,000
students
from
henrico
attended
some
courses
there,
10,000
from
chesterfield,
10,000
from
richmond.
so
that's
what
significance
the
line
has
for
us
in
richmond
today.
i
submit
the
richmond
school
board
in
light
of
its
ignoring
these
lines
in
the
past
for
educational
purposes
could
not
stand
up
here
if
it
is
so
desired
and
interpose
this
line
as
a
shield
to
effective
relief.
i
think
that
on
the
basis
of
the
state
laws,
the
state
board
policies,
of
the
past
treatment
of
these
lines,
what
else
could
a
chancellor
conclude
that
he
was
entitled
to
use
certainly
at
the
very
least,
the
same
means
that
were
used
to
violate
the
constitution.
i
fail
to
see
where
that
is
a
drastic
decision
on
the
part
of
a
person
seeking
to
remedy
a
constitutional
violation.
one
other
thing
on
the
map
i
would
point
out,
the
henrico
offices
are
located
right
in
the
heart
of
the
city.
the
building
permit
for
kennedy
school
was
issued
by
henrico
county.
mr.
george
b.
little
right,
quite
obvious.
mr.
george
b.
little
chesterfield
county,
that
is
right
sir.
this
is
the
james
river,
this
line
right
through
here,
henrico
envelopes
the
city,
north
of
the
river.
chesterfield
envelopes
the
city
south
of
the
river,
like
a
butterfly
as
one
witness
testified.
mr.
george
b.
little
automatically
changed,
yes
sir.
we
--
that
boundary
shifted
some
14
times
by
virtue
of
annexations.
may
i
come
to
some
of
the
key
aspects
of
the
relief
decree.
i
think
it's
highly
significant,
the
judge's
order
of
january
the
10th
on
which
this
appeal
was
taken,
simply
requires
these
school
authorities
to
exercise
powers
which
they
presently
possess
under
state
law,
namely
to
consolidate
these
schools.
secondly
i
would
like
to
observe
is
we
are
not
saying
that
the
particular
plan,
even
though
the
district
court
found
it
to
be
reasonable,
feasible,
workable,
educationally
sound,
we
do
not
stand
here
saying
it's
the
only
plan
to
effectively
desegregate
these
schools.
mr.
george
b.
little
all
it
requires
is
the
consent
of
the
state
board
of
education
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
detailed
framework
set
out,
first
it's
section
2230
of
the
code,
found
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
on
page
617.
then
there
is
this
long
series
of
statutes
saying
how
do
you
bring
it
about?
how
you
create
the
board?
how
the
representation
is
determined?
how
the
finances
both
for
capital
outlay
and
operating
funds
are
handled?
there
is
a
detailed
framework
set
out
in
state
law.
all
it
requires
is
a
request.
the
state
board
has
to
approve
the
request
and
the
counties
have
to
consent
to
it,
but
once
the
consent
is
there
the
machinery
is
already
in
our
law
to
set
it
up.
but
coming
back
to
the
plan,
the
only
reason
it
was
the
only
plan
before
the
court,
was
that
despite
invitations
from
the
court
and
from
the
richmond
school
board,
none
the
respondents
would
participate
in
the
preparation
of
a
plan
even
assuming
this
relief
were
appropriate.
the
lower
court
in
its
order
of
january
the
10th
expressly
provided
and
gave
them
an
abiding
opportunity
to
come
in
and
make
amendments
to
the
plan,
modify
the
plan,
even
at
this
stage
or
they
come
up
with
a
better
plan
so
long
as
it
eliminates
segregation
and
effects,
there
will
be
no
problem.
now,
one
of
the
point
on
the
plan.
there
is
no
more
racial
balance
created
under
this
plan,
in
the
plan
approved
by
this
court
in
swann
and
mecklenburg.
under
the
plan
in
swann,
the
variance
in
black
composition
range
from
8%
to
38.
under
the
richmond
school
board
plan
here
it
ranges
from
17-41%
black.
it
is
true
that
every
schools
ends
up
majority
white,
just
like
it
did
in
swann
and
mecklenburg,
simply
because
of
the
historically
stable
racial
composition
which
has
not
varied
one-tenth
of
1%
in
a
decade
in
richmond,
in
the
richmond
metropolitan
area,
of
two-thirds
white,
one
third
black.
this
court
in
mcdaniel
versus
barresi
by
approving
that
plan
for
the
clark
country,
certainly
approved
to
plan
which
does
a
lot
more
toward
racial
balance
than
either
this
plan
contemplates
or
results
in
or
was
done
in
swann.
furthermore
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
caveat
of
the
district
court
found
on
the
white
petitioner
appendix,
volume
ii,
page
519
and
520,
where
the
court
itself
said,
“whereas
the
racial
composition
is
educationally
sound
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
for
it.
it's
not
to
be
deemed
inflexible.
greater
variations
might
be
unavoidable
and
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
make
amendments.”
in
concluding
then,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
this
record,
the
acceptance
of
inter-divisional
assignments
is
certainly
not
too
broad
a
remedial
device.
it
has
inherent
limitations,
namely
time
and
distance.
the
only
time
where
inter-divisional
assignments
would
be
an
appropriate
remedial
tool
would
be
whereas
here
the
transportation
times
and
distances
are
remarkably
comparable
to
what
is
presently
being
carried
out
in
each
of
the
separate
divisions.
in
conclusion,
i
think
the
bald
truth
is
shown
by
this
map.
we
have
67-68,
60%
blacks
school
right
now
in
richmond.
this
is
based
on
1971,
1972
figures.
look
what's
right
next
door,
seven-tenths
of
1%
black,
three-tenths
of
1%
black,
0%
black
and
the
greatest
percentage
of
black
in
any
of
the
schools
shown
here
is
5%.
that
is
our
problem
and
if
this
court
affirms
the
fourth
circuit,
you
have
the
stark
reality
of
black
and
white
schools
in
the
face
of
a
feasible
alternative
for
eliminating
and
finally
if
it
affirms
the
fourth
circuit,
i
think
it
is
all
too
clear
from
a
particular
standpoint,
that
the
promises
of
brown
would
be
rendered
illusory
for
every
black
child
in
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
george
b.
little
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
marshal
is
bringing
an
exhibit
in
which
you
would
prefer
that
i
--
mr.
george
b.
little
alright.
as
mr.
coleman
stated,
the
richmond
school
board
an
arm
of
the
state
of
virgina
conceded
that
its
schools
were
not
being
operated
in
accordance
with
constitutional
requirements.
in
addition
this
biracial
board,
consisting
of
four
whites
and
three
blacks,
is
unanimous
in
it's
belief
that
there
can
be
no
elimination
of
black
and
white
schools,
absent
assignment
of
pupils
across
existing
lines.
i
would
like
to
capsule
four
aspects
of
this
case
underlying
this
position.
a
brief
word
on
the
constitutional
violation,
discussion
of
the
precise
issue,
a
more
detailed
review
of
the
evidence
which
shows
the
lack
of
sanctity
in
these
school
division
lines
and
finally
key
aspects
of
the
particular
relief
decree.
coming
to
the
constitutional
violation,
the
mere
fact
that
a
dual
school
system
was
still
flourishing
in
richmond,
16
years
after
brown,
provides
the
nexus
for
the
relief
decree.
the
only
question
confronting
the
district
court
from
the
first
day
of
the
reopening
of
this
protracted
litigation
was
how
to
remedy
this
persistent
and
deliberately
deferred
perpetuation
of
a
dual
school
system.
this
is
a
remedy
case.
we
do
not
have
to
search
for
a
constitutional
violation.
this
search
for
an
effective
remedy
provides
the
lens
through
which
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
actions
of
the
district
court
must
be
viewed.
the
precise
issue
is
rather
narrow.
if
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
approving
a
richmond
school
board
desegregation
plan,
which
involved
assignments
of
pupils
across
these
lines.
this
concept
of
inter-divisional
assignments
constituted
the
essential
ingredient
in
both
of
the
alternative
forms
of
relief
sought,
consolidation
was
not
the
only
relief
sought.
the
first
was
a
contractual
interchange
between
the
existing
school
divisions
fully
authorized
by
state
law.
the
second
was
a
consolidation
of
these
school
divisions
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
state
law.
our
position
is
that
the
action
of
the
lower
court
was
dictated
on
this
record
by
a
sound
application
of
the
all
too
familiar
remedial
guidelines
previously
established
by
this
court.
under
these
decisions,
there
is
only
one
test,
that's
effectiveness,
effectiveness
is
the
key.
no
one
can
stand
before
the
bar
of
this
court
and
argue
that
the
richmond
school
board
plan
is
not
obviously
more
effective
than
the
present
plans
in
operation
in
richmond
or
henrico
or
chesterfield.
the
respondents
and
the
government
has
studiously
avoided
any
discussion
of
effectiveness
which
we
as
understand
it
is
the
heart
of
brown,
green,
swann,
davis
and
other
decisions
of
this
court.
the
district
court,
let
me
go
back.
what
we
analyzed
is
the
position
of
the
respondents'
to
be
and
the
government
apparently
is
it
not
withstanding
these
guidelines
which
are
so
clear
and
explicit,
regardless
of
consequences,
regardless
of
the
feasibility
of
the
means
to
overcome
these
lines,
regardless
of
the
past
treatment
of
these
lines
by
the
state
of
virgina,
these
lines
impose
a
geographical
limitation
on
the
powers
of
a
chancellor
seeking
to
remedy
an
admitted
constitutional
violation.
the
district
court
very
carefully
considered
the
importance
which
state
authorities,
local
authorities
had
attached
to
these
lines.
he
concluded
that
there
was
no
overriding
state
interest
in
either
restricting
the
assignment
of
pupils
to
the
political
subdivision
in
which
they
reside
or
in
requiring
each
political
subdivision
to
operate
it's
own
school
system.
he
also
concluded
from
a
review
of
all
of
the
facts,
that
these
lines
did
constitute
barriers
to
any
effective
relief
for
these
plaintiffs.
now
what
evidence
supports
these
findings?
it
falls
into
three
areas.
first
we
don't
have
to
look
for,
we
simply
only
have
to
go
to
the
code
of
virgina,
the
state
laws.
we
next
can
go
to
the
expressed
policies
of
the
state
board
of
education,
the
father,
we
are
a
child
in
virginia.
the
power
over
schools
is
in
the
state,
this
is
a
state
violation.
richmond
did
not
of
its
own
initiative
set
up
a
dual
school
system.
we
can
go
to
the
established
policies
of
the
board
and
finally
we
can
go
to
the
history
of
past
practices.
let's
come
to
the
laws.
our
code
expressly
for
many
years
has
set
out
a
framework
for
the
operation
of
a
school
division
consisting
of
two
or
more
separate
and
distinct
political
sub-divisions.
our
state
law
for
years
and
we
have
all
used
it,
has
expressly
provided
for
the
operation
of
joint
schools
for
any
educational
need.
our
state
law,
and
we
have
all
engaged
in
it,
not
all,
but
many
divisions
have
specifically
provides
for
the
contractual
interchange
of
pupils
between
separate
political
sub-divisions.
these,
the
very
existence
of
these
laws
totally
belongs
any
overriding
state
interest
in
restricting
the
assignment
of
pupils
to
the
political
sub-division
in
which
they
live,
but
they
even
do
something
else
under
the
remedial
guidelines
of
this
court,
a
fair
interpretation
of
it.
they
suggested
alternatives
which
a
district
court
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
to
end
segregation
and
its
effects
had
to
consider.
let's
come
to
state
board
policies.
the
state
board
of
education
has
encouraged
consolidations
of
separate
political
sub-divisions
into
one
school
division
for
almost
30
years.
in
1944,
it
approved
and
excepted
in
principle
a
plan
which
had
as
its
objective
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
school
divisions
then
in
existence
in
virginia.
at
that
time,
we
had
a
110
and
for
the
most
part
each
represented
a
separate
political
sub-division.
this
plan
which
was
endorsed
by
our
own
state
board
of
education,
had
as
its
objective
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
school
divisions
from
a
110
to
40
or
50,
which
would
have
necessarily
involved
combining
the
separate
political
sub-divisions
into
a
single
school
division.
as
recently
as
1969,
again
in
a
statement
expressing
the
desire
of
the
state
board
statement
that
consolidation
be
considered
for
educational
needs,
expressly
stated
that
“political
boundary
lines
do
not
necessarily
conform
to
educational
needs.”
this
is
not
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
said.
this
is
what
our
own
state
board
of
education
has
recognized.
mr.
george
b.
little
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
this
is
on
richmond
school
board
exhibit
82.
it's
in
the
exhibit
appendix
on
page
63
and
64.
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
last
two
sentences,
“the
state
board
therefore
has
favored
in
principle
the
consolidations
of
school
divisions
with
the
view
to
creating
administrative
units
appropriate
to
modern
educational
needs.”
mr.
george
b.
little
i
beg
your
pardon,
this
is
the
exhibit
appendix.
this
is
the
thin
brown
appendix.
it's
hard
to
identify
these
sir.
64,
in
particular,
the
language
i
am
quoting.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
second
paragraph,
“has
favored
in
principle
consolidation
of
school
divisions
with
a
view
to
creating
administrative
units
appropriate
to
modern
educational
needs.
the
board
regrets
the
current
trends
to
the
contrary,
pursuant
to
which
some
counties
and
newly
formed
cities
have
sought
separate
divisional
status
based
on
political
boundary
lines
which
do
not
necessarily
conform
to
educational
needs.”
not
only
the
state
board
but
this
record
contains
testimony
from
some
of
the
more
outstanding
educational
experts
of
the
country
which
agree
with
the
state
board,
that
political
boundary
lines
are
of
no
significance
in
the
area
of
education.
now
so
much
for
the
state
board
policies,
let
me
pass
on
--
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
george
b.
little
approximately,
130.
mr.
george
b.
little
a
110
--
mr.
george
b.
little
right
sir.
more
towns
have
attained
status
such
as
this
court
saw
and
inquired,
that
is
the
reason
for
the
increase.
the
objectives
of
that
plan
were
never
carried
out,
but
i
am
urging
it
to
show
what
the
policy
of
the
state
board
has
been.
let's
come
to
the
past
practices
of
these
with
respect
to
these
lines.
the
district
court
quite
popularly
found
that
the
state
officials
and
local
officials
had
historically
used
principles
of
consolidation
and
inter-divisional
assignment
of
pupils
in
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
regional
schools
for
blacks,
joint
schools
for
blacks
and
joint
schools
for
other
educational
needs.
these
regional
schools
for
blacks
consisted
of
as
many
as
four
separate
political
subdivisions,
encompassing
an
area
as
large
as
1700
square
miles,
requiring
the
children
to
spend
the
night
at
these
schools
because
of
the
extreme
travel
distances
involved.
these
schools
operated
in
virgina
and
the
last
one
didn't
close
as
this
court
might
have
anticipated
in
1955,
it
closed
in
1968.
there
is
a
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
finance
problems
arose
as
a
result
of
one
regional
school
being
supported
by
four,
as
many
as
four
or
five
separate
political
sub-divisions.
now
what
about
the
use
of
inter-divisional
assignments?
there
is
a
statute
on
our
books,
it's
still
on
the
books,
section
22,
115
found
on
our
brief
but
also
in
the
petition
appendix
at
194
which
in
1960,
the
state
declared
it
a
matter
of
public
policy
of
the
state
to
encourage
students
to
participate
in
programs
which
would
require
them
to
attend
schools
in
political
sub-divisions
other
than
the
one
in
which
they
reside.
the
more
significant
in
order
to
perpetuate
segregation,
not
pre-brown,
but
after
brown
the
50s,
the
late
60s,
thousands
of
blacks
were
involuntarily
shoved
across
these
so-called
sacred
lines
for
the
sole
purpose
of
perpetuating
segregation
in
defiance
of
this
court
and
in
defiance
of
the
affirmative
duty
on
school
authorities
to
end
discrimination.
now
is
this
all
history,
what's
happening
today?
let's
come
to
richmond,
if
we
can.
mr.
coleman
mentioned
kennedy
high
school.
this
black
line
irregularly
shaped,
is
the
city
limit
of
richmond.
the
only
schools
shown
on
the
map
are
those
within
one
to
three
miles
of
that
line,
this
one
school
might
be
a
little
more
than
three
miles.
kennedy
high
school,
the
blacks
in
richmond
historically
and
today
live
in
the
eastern
portion
of
the
city
to
south
central
portion,
this
is
the
black
part
of
the
city.
the
lily
white
area
is
in
the
western
part
and
part
of
the
southern.
kennedy
high
school
right
here,
is
a
richmond
school
opened
in
1967.
it
is
located
entirely
in
henrico,
county.
it
opened
as
an
all
black
school
and
everyday
since
it
is
opened,
1500
children
cross
this
so-called
iron
curtain,
attend
kennedy,
leave
that
school
and
cross
that
line
again
to
go
home.
mr.
george
b.
little
not
that
we
know
of
sir.
we
did
discover
in
one
of
the
schools
that
this
henrico
child
by
giving
a
false
address
had
enrolled,
i
am
not
sure
of
this,
but
it
was
in
armstrong
high
school.
on
fairfield
court,
is
another
richmond
school,
it's
an
elementary
school,
historically
a
black
school.
that
lies
partly
in
the
county
and
partly
in
the
city.
it
enrolls
about
560
students.
each
day
of
their
lives
they
cross
the
line
to
go
to
school,
they
probably
cross
the
line
several
times
during
the
day,
during
the
school
because
the
line
goes
right
through
the
school
building.
so
far
as
crossing
lines
in
the
past,
as
recently
as
1969,
henrico
was
operating
this
school
right
up
here
in
the
extreme
northern
parts
of
the
county.
they
do
claim
to
be
lovers
of
neighborhood
schools,
have
a
neighborhood
school
for
this
school
consisting
of
the
entire
henrico
county.
students
from
the
eastern
most
portion
of
henrico
to
get
to
that
school,
had
to
go
into
the
city
across
this
great
line
through
the
city
outside
the
line
again,
up
here.
that's
how
sacred
the
lines
were.
at
the
present
time,
henrico,
richmond,
chesterfield,
operate
joint
schools
for
educational
needs.
the
location
of
the
maths
science
center
referred
to
by
mr.
coleman
is
right
here.
the
school
for
--
i
beg
your
pardon
this
school
right
here.
in
1970-1971
approximately,
it
varies
within
the
1000
or
1500,
approximately
10,000
students
from
henrico
attended
some
courses
there,
10,000
from
chesterfield,
10,000
from
richmond.
so
that's
what
significance
the
line
has
for
us
in
richmond
today.
i
submit
the
richmond
school
board
in
light
of
its
ignoring
these
lines
in
the
past
for
educational
purposes
could
not
stand
up
here
if
it
is
so
desired
and
interpose
this
line
as
a
shield
to
effective
relief.
i
think
that
on
the
basis
of
the
state
laws,
the
state
board
policies,
of
the
past
treatment
of
these
lines,
what
else
could
a
chancellor
conclude
that
he
was
entitled
to
use
certainly
at
the
very
least,
the
same
means
that
were
used
to
violate
the
constitution.
i
fail
to
see
where
that
is
a
drastic
decision
on
the
part
of
a
person
seeking
to
remedy
a
constitutional
violation.
one
other
thing
on
the
map
i
would
point
out,
the
henrico
offices
are
located
right
in
the
heart
of
the
city.
the
building
permit
for
kennedy
school
was
issued
by
henrico
county.
mr.
george
b.
little
right,
quite
obvious.
mr.
george
b.
little
chesterfield
county,
that
is
right
sir.
this
is
the
james
river,
this
line
right
through
here,
henrico
envelopes
the
city,
north
of
the
river.
chesterfield
envelopes
the
city
south
of
the
river,
like
a
butterfly
as
one
witness
testified.
mr.
george
b.
little
automatically
changed,
yes
sir.
we
--
that
boundary
shifted
some
14
times
by
virtue
of
annexations.
may
i
come
to
some
of
the
key
aspects
of
the
relief
decree.
i
think
it's
highly
significant,
the
judge's
order
of
january
the
10th
on
which
this
appeal
was
taken,
simply
requires
these
school
authorities
to
exercise
powers
which
they
presently
possess
under
state
law,
namely
to
consolidate
these
schools.
secondly
i
would
like
to
observe
is
we
are
not
saying
that
the
particular
plan,
even
though
the
district
court
found
it
to
be
reasonable,
feasible,
workable,
educationally
sound,
we
do
not
stand
here
saying
it's
the
only
plan
to
effectively
desegregate
these
schools.
mr.
george
b.
little
all
it
requires
is
the
consent
of
the
state
board
of
education
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
detailed
framework
set
out,
first
it's
section
2230
of
the
code,
found
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
on
page
617.
then
there
is
this
long
series
of
statutes
saying
how
do
you
bring
it
about?
how
you
create
the
board?
how
the
representation
is
determined?
how
the
finances
both
for
capital
outlay
and
operating
funds
are
handled?
there
is
a
detailed
framework
set
out
in
state
law.
all
it
requires
is
a
request.
the
state
board
has
to
approve
the
request
and
the
counties
have
to
consent
to
it,
but
once
the
consent
is
there
the
machinery
is
already
in
our
law
to
set
it
up.
but
coming
back
to
the
plan,
the
only
reason
it
was
the
only
plan
before
the
court,
was
that
despite
invitations
from
the
court
and
from
the
richmond
school
board,
none
the
respondents
would
participate
in
the
preparation
of
a
plan
even
assuming
this
relief
were
appropriate.
the
lower
court
in
its
order
of
january
the
10th
expressly
provided
and
gave
them
an
abiding
opportunity
to
come
in
and
make
amendments
to
the
plan,
modify
the
plan,
even
at
this
stage
or
they
come
up
with
a
better
plan
so
long
as
it
eliminates
segregation
and
effects,
there
will
be
no
problem.
now,
one
of
the
point
on
the
plan.
there
is
no
more
racial
balance
created
under
this
plan,
in
the
plan
approved
by
this
court
in
swann
and
mecklenburg.
under
the
plan
in
swann,
the
variance
in
black
composition
range
from
8%
to
38.
under
the
richmond
school
board
plan
here
it
ranges
from
17-41%
black.
it
is
true
that
every
schools
ends
up
majority
white,
just
like
it
did
in
swann
and
mecklenburg,
simply
because
of
the
historically
stable
racial
composition
which
has
not
varied
one-tenth
of
1%
in
a
decade
in
richmond,
in
the
richmond
metropolitan
area,
of
two-thirds
white,
one
third
black.
this
court
in
mcdaniel
versus
barresi
by
approving
that
plan
for
the
clark
country,
certainly
approved
to
plan
which
does
a
lot
more
toward
racial
balance
than
either
this
plan
contemplates
or
results
in
or
was
done
in
swann.
furthermore
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
caveat
of
the
district
court
found
on
the
white
petitioner
appendix,
volume
ii,
page
519
and
520,
where
the
court
itself
said,
“whereas
the
racial
composition
is
educationally
sound
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
for
it.
it's
not
to
be
deemed
inflexible.
greater
variations
might
be
unavoidable
and
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
make
amendments.”
in
concluding
then,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
this
record,
the
acceptance
of
inter-divisional
assignments
is
certainly
not
too
broad
a
remedial
device.
it
has
inherent
limitations,
namely
time
and
distance.
the
only
time
where
inter-divisional
assignments
would
be
an
appropriate
remedial
tool
would
be
whereas
here
the
transportation
times
and
distances
are
remarkably
comparable
to
what
is
presently
being
carried
out
in
each
of
the
separate
divisions.
in
conclusion,
i
think
the
bald
truth
is
shown
by
this
map.
we
have
67-68,
60%
blacks
school
right
now
in
richmond.
this
is
based
on
1971,
1972
figures.
look
what's
right
next
door,
seven-tenths
of
1%
black,
three-tenths
of
1%
black,
0%
black
and
the
greatest
percentage
of
black
in
any
of
the
schools
shown
here
is
5%.
that
is
our
problem
and
if
this
court
affirms
the
fourth
circuit,
you
have
the
stark
reality
of
black
and
white
schools
in
the
face
of
a
feasible
alternative
for
eliminating
and
finally
if
it
affirms
the
fourth
circuit,
i
think
it
is
all
too
clear
from
a
particular
standpoint,
that
the
promises
of
brown
would
be
rendered
illusory
for
every
black
child
in
the
city
of
richmond.
