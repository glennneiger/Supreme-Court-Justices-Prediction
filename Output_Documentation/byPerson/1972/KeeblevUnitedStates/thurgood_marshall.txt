justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
this
particular
petition
that
was
subject
to
what
kind
of
a
tribal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
tribe
could
change
that
and
have
their
own
trial
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
they
don’t
then
they
automatically
get
this
or
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
are
the
judges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
difference
is
that
as
it
is
today
and
what
it
was
in
1880?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
on
the
site
where
this
crime
was
committed
there
was
a
nonresident
indian
from
washington
and
me
from
washington
and
we
committed
a
crime,
would
the
indian
be
tried
any
different
from
me
than
nonresident
indian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
mines
a
nonresident.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn’t
apply
to
nonresident
indian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
then
if
the
two
of
us
go
out
there
and
commit
a
crime,
the
indian
gets
a
different
trail
than
the
one
i
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
won’t
mind
if
i
ask
the
solicitor
general
that
same
question,
will
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
the
non-residents?
do
you
agree
with
what
he
said
that
if
an
indian
and
a
non-indian
go
out
there
that
they
get
a
different
trial,
when
they
commit
the
same
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
indian
resident
break
on
it,
all
i
have
to
do
is
say
i
got
to
drop
an
indian
blood
then
i
get
that,
don't
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
this
tiptoeing
had
nothing
to
do
with
indians
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
they
tiptoed
in
this
assimilative
statute
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
i
ask
the
question,
were
the
indians
considered
on
the
assimilated
crime
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
this
type
of
case
considered
on
when
you
have
the
assimilated
crimes
statute
which
allows
the
states
to
move,
right?
was
the
indian
question
brought
up
in
congress
during
that
consideration
those
statutes,
the
assimilative
crime
statutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i
was
talking
about,
the
major
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
get
around
the
individual
constitutional
right
asserted
by
individual
in
this
court
by
answering
it
before
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number,
we
could
get
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
based
on
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
this
man,
the
petition
on
this
case,
is
it
based
on
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
he
is
an
indian,
spelled
indian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
we’re
only
talking
about
this
one
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
can’t
talk
about
the
one
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
this
particular
petition
that
was
subject

what

justice
thurgood

but
if

thurgood

justice
thurgood

what
