before

i’m
having
trouble,
some
problem
with
the
record
trying
to
reconcile
the
charge
with
the
statute.
your
friend’s
statement
of
the
case
recites
at
page

the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
of
assault
with
intent
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm
under

the

the
discrepancy
here,
the
statutory
authority
deals
with
assault
with
resulting
in
great
bodily
harm,
serious
bodily

and
the
indictment
was
assault

well,
i
suppose
an
example

if
someone
simply
slapped
the

another

that
resulted
in
displacing
