mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
which
this
case
presents
is
one
of
a
broad
range
of
issues
arising
in
both
the
civil
and
criminal
contexts
which
have
required
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
to
reconcile
in
some
viable
manner,
the
extremely
complex
conflicting
elements
of
the
status
of
tribal
reservation
indians.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
recognize
there
were
countless
this
morning
with
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
indeed
i
understand
that
and
it’s
a
terribly
complex
problem.
the
conflicting
elements
at
least
as
the
relevant
to
this
case
in
their
basic
form
are
quite
well
known
i
will
not
dwell
on
them.
on
the
one
hand
the
reservation
indian
has
historically
been
regarded
as
a
member
of
a
separate
sovereignty
and
although
congress
within
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there’s
no
question
mr.
justice
marshall
that
they
get
a
different
trial
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
and
it
is
that
discrepancy
which
i
claim
to
deal
with
in
the
course
of
this
argument.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
indeed
it
could.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
then
they
cannot
be
tried
in
the
federal
court
and
are
tried
only
in
the
tribal
court.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
there
are
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
are
myriad
of
splits
mr.
justice
stewart,
between
the
federal
court,
the
state
court
and
the
tribal
court
and
they
do
without
question
depend
on
racial
categorizations,
there’s
no
question
on
that.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
and
with
the
victim
as
well.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
sometimes
with
respect
to
the
victim
and
there
is
a
myriad
of
very
complicated
jurisdictional
allocations.
we
deal
here
with
a
relatively
simple
one
and
i
would
like
as
much
as
possible
to
confine
this
inquiry.
i
think
it
would
be
most
useful
to
the
relatively
clear
jurisdictional
allocation
in
dispute
here.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
that’s
a
complicated
question
mr.
justice
marshall.
you
may
conceivably
and
i
do
think
there’s
any
reason
to
get
into
this
case.
you
may
have
to
be,
not
only
prove
that
you
have
a
drop
of
any
blood
but
more
than
that
and
you
may
have
to
prove
that
you’ve
got
this,
the
right
kind
of
drop
of
blood
and
you
member
of
this
particular
tribe
that
resides
on
this
reservation.
but
i
think
that
those
questions
are
much
of
the
periphery
of
this
particular
inquiry
which
is
quite
important
to
focus
on
precisely
what
it
is.
as
i
say,
this
concept
that
indian
sovereignty
is
limited
to
some
extent
within
certain
broad
boundaries
by
congress’s
power
to
redefine
and
narrow
the
scope
of
indian
tribal
sovereignty
through
the
passage
of
legislation.
nonetheless,
the
court
has
consistently
recognized
for
hundreds
of
years
that
tribal
sovereignty
springs
from
independent
roots
that
it
retains
a
life
and
force
of
its
own
and
that
its
residual
effects
can
only
be
eliminated
through
very
explicit
congressional
action,
and
it
was
on
this
basis
that
the
court
decided
in
ex
parte
crow
dog
at
109
u.s.
that
the
federal
courts
had
no
jurisdiction,
absent
a
specific
statute
over
the
murder
of
an
indian
by
another
indian
on
the
reservation
because
congress
had
never
withdrawn
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
a
such
an
offense
from
the
sovereign
tribe.
and
then
again
as
recently
as
1970
in
the
kennelly
case,
the
court
very
strictly
construed
a
federal
statute,
authorizing
the
tribes
to
see
their
civil
jurisdiction
over
matters
arising
on
the
reservation
and
in
short
the
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
those
aspects
of
tribal
sovereignty
of
which
congress
has
not
very
explicitly
withdrawn
or
still
in
full
force.
on
the
other
hand,
and
this
is
where
the
particular
difficulty
in
this
case
arises,
since
1924
all
indians,
including
those
residing
on
reservations
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
government
and
tribal
courts
had
been
considered
united
states
citizens
who
enjoy
the
same
privileges
and
rights
conferred
by
that
status
which
other
united
states
citizens
enjoy.
the
inherent
conflict
between
these
two
elements
of
indians
status
is
obvious
enough
to
the
extent
that
the
tribal
indian
remains
subject
to
the
governmental
authority
of
the
sovereign
tribal
group
to
which
he
belongs.
he
inevitably
finds
that
merely
because
he
is
a
tribal
indian,
he
enjoys
certain
privileges
and
incurs
certain
legal
obligations
which
are
not
shared
by
other
american
citizens.
one
example
of
this
which
we
have
alluded
to
already
in
this
argument
and
which
seems
to
me
crucially
relevant
to
an
understanding
of
the
particular
discrepancy
with
respect
to
which
petitioner
complains
here,
is
it
the
tribal
indian
who
commits
a
crime
against
another
indian
on
the
reservation
is
punishable
exclusively
in
the
tribal
court,
unless
the
crime
is
one
of
those
with
respect
to
which
congress
has
specifically
delegated
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
or
state
courts
as
for
example
in
the
major
crimes
act.
though
congress
has
repeatedly
found,
as
i
shall
discuss
shortly,
that
the
preservation
of
the
tribal
court
system
is
of
great
benefit
to
reservation
indians,
subjection
to
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction,
appears
to
have
elements
in
some
cases
of
both
comparative
advantage
and
comparative
at
least
theoretical
disadvantage
to
the
tribal
indian.
aside
for
example
from
the
comfort
which
he
may
derive
for
being
judged
by
this
tribal
brothers
in
a
proceeding
that
is
meaningful
and
familiar
to
him
and
to
his
culture,
the
commentators
appear
to
agree
that
he
is
likely
to
receive
a
considerably
smaller
penalty
if
he
is
convicted
in
the
tribal
court.
in
this
case
for
example
the
penalty
which
the
tribal
court
imposed
for
the
actions
leading
to
the
charge
at
issue
here
was
15
days
incarceration
essentially
for
public
intoxication
and
a
fine
of
$20.00.
on
the
other
hand,
the
tribal
court
does
not
offer
the
panoply
of
procedural
rights
and
protections
which
a
non-indian
citizen
would
enjoy,
if
he
were
being
tried
for
the
same
offense
in
a
state
or
federal
court.
indeed
prior
to
1968,
congress
imposed
virtually
no
requirements
whatsoever
on
the
tribal
courts
and
with
minor
exceptions
the
federal
courts
held
that
because
of
the
continued
concept
of
tribal
sovereignty,
this
discrepancy
did
not
offend
the
constitution.
in
1968,
as
the
court
knows,
congress
passed
the
indian
bill
of
rights
which
imposed
on
the
tribal
courts
at
least
a
scalable
version,
the
outlines
of
which
had
not
yet
been
adjudicated
of
the
rights
enumerated
in
the
first
10
amendments
to
the
constitution,
but
that
was
presumably
not
by
constitutional
mandate,
but
part
of
congress’s
decision
to
slowly
integrate
the
indian
tribal
system
into
the
concept
of
justice
and
inherent
in
rest
of
the
country.
indeed,
the
indian
bill
of
rights,
we
would
suggest
is
representative
of
a
pattern
that
has
been
very
wisely
followed
in
the
reconciliation
of
the
conflicting
elements
of
the
indian
status.
a
few
federal
court
of
appeals
in
years
immediately
prior
to
the
passage
of
that
act
had
indicated
some
impatience
with
the
slow
movement
of
tribal
courts
in
the
direction
of
affording
traditional
constitutional
protections
to
criminal
defendants
and
it
had
been
suggested
in
at
least
one
case
that
a
proceeding
in
a
tribal
court
might
be
reviewable
in
the
federal
courts
on
the
ground
that
the
tribal
court
was
obligated
to
provide
at
least
some
constitutional
procedure.
it’s
rather
awkward
doctrine
for
a
court
to
be
applying
because
it
applies
a
piecemeal
with
no
ascertainable
standard
constitutional
protections
rather
than
applying
it
across
the
board.
but
it
was
recognized
even
in
that
case
that
congress
is
the
appropriate
body
and
is
in
a
lesser
awkward
and
more
appropriate
decision
to
determine
the
details
of
the
plan
by
which
tribal
justice
can
be
integrated
into
the
american
constitutional
system
in
a
manner
that
preserves
to
the
extent
congress
deems
desirable
both
to
sovereign
rights
of
the
tribal
government
and
the
rights
owed
to
indians
as
citizens
of
united
states.
and
so
congress
has
repeatedly
responded
in
all
areas
related
to
this
case
not
with
a
mechanical
across
the
board
application
of
constitutional
requirements
on
the
tribal
court
system,
but
with
the
set
of
requirements
which
the
congress
considers
viable
in
terms
of
preserving
the
basic
nature
of
those
courts.
now,
this
case
presents
this
court
with
another
closely
related
aspect
of
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
status
of
indians
as
citizens
and
their
status
as
members
of
a
separate
sovereignty.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
have
two
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
this
is
a
certainly
a
problem
mr.
justice
burger,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don’t
have
a
full
answer
to
it.
it
hasn’t
been
raised
before
and
it
is
been
accepted
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
that
these
two
offenses
are
sufficiently
related
so
that
the
major
crimes
act
confers
the
jurisdiction
under
the
south
dakota
law
to
try
for
assault
with
intent
to
commit
the
crime.
i
have
two
answers
in
mitigation
of
the
very
obvious
objection
that
there
may
be
an
element
required
in
the
major
crimes
act
which
is
not
required
under
south
dakota
law
to
with
their
element
of
actual
serious
bodily
damage
and
that
would
be
the
objection.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
offense
in
south
dakota
of
assault
with
intent
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm
is
prosecuted
in
practice
unless
there
is
in
fact
a
great
bodily
harm,
and
the
other
answer
to
that
is
in
this
case
it
is
entirely
undisputed
on
the
record
and
i
do
not
believe
petitioner
would
dispute
that
the
actual
incident
here
resulted
in
great
bodily
harm.
i
doubt
that
the
federal
government
would
have
prosecuted
had
it
not
resulted
in
great
bodily
harm
and
i
simply
believe
the
theoretical
possibility
of
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
great
bodily
harm
but
perhaps
a
proof
that
there
was
an
intent
on
successfully
carried
out
to
cause
great
bodily
harm
as
an
open
question.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
sorry
i
don’t
understand
the
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
because
that
is
the
way
the
state
statute
is
defined
but
as
i
say,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
state
statute
is
ever
applicable
except
where
in
fact
the
harm
resulted.
indeed,
it’s
an
interesting
it
may
work
just
the
other
way
because
they
may
well
be
great
bodily
harm
which
would
satisfy
the
wording
of
1153
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
--
without
the
requisite
intent
and
it
simply
intend
to
cause
assault
at
all
might
arguably
be
sufficient
to
carry
forward
even
if
no
bodily
harm
were
intended
but
great
bodily
harm
resulted,
but
on
the
context
of
this
case,
i
do
not
think
the
issue
was
raised,
not
only
because
it
has
been
raised
below
but
because
everybody’s
total
agreement
not
only
great
bodily,
but
death
as
a
result
of
this
serious
incidents.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that’s
disputed
in
the
record
but
at
least
it
was,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
victim
walked
out
in
pretty
terrible
shape,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
died
the
next
morning
and
if
there
was
some
doubt
whether
he
died
of
the
injuries
of
over-exposure.
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
probably
died
of
over-exposure,
but
there
was
other
testimony
that
he
had
been
very,
very
severely
battered.
there
was
blood
splattered
all
over
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
and
i
think
no
question
that
the
event
of
great
bodily
harm
came.
and
i
think
this
question
that
the
chief
justice
quite
aptly
raises
really
ought
to
be
--
i
do
not
think
it
would
arise
because
i
doubt
seriously
there
would
be
a
prosecution,
absent
bodily
harm,
but
if
so
i
think
that
that
problem
should
wait
to
a
case
in
which
the
objection
is
properly
raised
and
no
great
bodily
harm
was
present.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right
which
adds
it
incidentally
in
element
that
is
not
necessarily
present
in
the
federal
crime.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
intent
to
cause
great
bodily
harm
is
not
necessarily
present
in
the
federal
list
in
18
u.s.c.
1153,
only
the
actual
causing.
now,
clearly
some
type
of
intent
is
necessary.
intent
to
commit
a
battery
at
all,
but
it
isn’t
clear
that
18
u.s.c.
1153
would
ever
require
that
there
be
intent
of
actual
great
harm.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
that’s
right,
intent
to
assault
which
would
include
some
sort
of
intent
to
commit
the
assault
but
not
a
specific
intent
resulting
in
great
bodily
harm.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
you
could,
you
could
have
that
situation.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
i
don’t
think
if
it’s
just
not
present
in
this
case,
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
yes,
because
that
raises
a
problem,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
the
grant
is
worded
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
question
and
i
suppose
we
can’t
argue
that
some
preliminary
threshold
statutory
question
cannot
be
considered
here,
that
the
court
need
decide
the
constitutional
question,
absent
some
satisfactory
determination
of
the
threshold
questions
that
would
set
that
up
for
which
reason
we
have
not
objected
for
example
to
the
statutory
argument
that
the
lesser
included
defense
charge
is
constructively
provided
in
18
u.s.c.
1153
which
the
petitioner
raises.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
then
he
clearly
would
not
properly
have
been
tried
in
the
federal
court
at
all.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
you
do
have
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
you
only
have
to
leave
it
for
some
other
case
where
in
fact,
the
element
of
great
bodily
harm
is
not
present,
mr.
justice
white.
my
point,
i
understand
what
the
court’s
difficulty
is
inherently,
but
i
think
it
is
a
speculative
difficulty.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
government
would
ever
attempt
or
that
south
dakota
law
would
permit
a
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
it
was
a
jury
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
instructions
deal
with
the
element
of
intent
and
do
not
specifically
require
a
finding
of
actual
harm
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
that
is
because
the
sole
defense
raised
that
the
trial
was
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
intent
and
it
was
admitted
throughout
the
trial
that
great
bodily
harm
had
occurred.
it
was
never
in
question
so
i
guess
it
wasn’t
raised.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
we
wouldn’t
necessarily
say
that
he
got
a
better
break
but
that
he
was
put
to
no
advantage
because
the
government
proved
with
no
possible
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
have
no
further
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
white
except
for
the
fact
i
think
a
reading
of
this
record
and
attention
to
both
petitioners
charged
to
himself,
requested
to
charge
himself
and
to
the
evidence
presented
would
reveal
no
conceivable
question
about
that
and
i
recognize
the
difficulty
of
assuming
a
directed
verdict
type
of
assumption
in
the
criminal
context,
but
i
think
that
the
presence
of
great
bodily
harm
is
as
conclusively
present
and
undisputed
in
the
context
that
this
case
as
it
could
possibly
be.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
it
deals
with
it
by
a
citation,
mr.
justice
stewart
of
the
nordelo
case
which
implies
that
when
in
a
criminal
context
generally,
the
federal
government
incorporates
a
state
definition
of
a
crime
that
it
really
only
incorporates
the
substantive
definition
and
not
necessarily
the
labels.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
have
some
question
as
to
how
far
we
can
take
that
in
this
case
to
the
extent
that
there
really
is
an
underlying
substantive
definitional
problem.
we
cited
as
i
recall
as
a
c
cite
and
it
is
suggestive
of
a
notion
that
i
think
it’s
hard
to
bring
too
far,
except
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
element
is
so
clearly
present
that
we
really
are
i
think
only
talking
about
by
this
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that
is
right,
but
i
have
some,
at
least
slight
reluctance
to
answer
to
i
believe
to
mr.
justice
white’s
suggestion
that
the
element,
there’s
no
question
about
it,
but
then
it
wasn’t
submitted
to
the
jury
and
i
recognize
that
it
is
difficult
to.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
he
charges
that
he
wasn't
--
he
doesn’t
specifically
say
that
he
is
not
charged
with
causing
serious
injuries
as
he
isn’t
charged
with
intent
to
kill.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
would
submit
with
all
deference
that
i
have
no
further
response
to
that
question
except
that
i
think
that
the
difficulty
which
is
raised
here
might
be
a
difficulty
in
another,
but
it
is
not
a
difficulty
in
this
case
and
ought
not
to
deter
this
court
from
reaching
the
merits
of
the
underlying
issue
that’s
presented.
as
i
say,
this
case
presents
the
court
with
an
isolated
aspect
of
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
status
of
indians
as
citizens
and
as
members
of
separate
sovereignty.
the
problem
arises
because
congress
has
determined
that
a
tribal
indian
who
commits
certain
major
crimes
against
another
indian
on
a
reservation
is
tried
in
the
same
manner
subject
to
the
same
penalty
as
a
non-indian
committing
the
identical
offense
and
yet
on
the
other
hand,
congress
has
determined
that
with
respect
to
all
other
crimes
not
listed
in
the
major
crimes
act,
a
tribal
indian
remains
subject
exclusively
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
court.
even
though
admittedly
his
non-indian
fellow
citizen
who
commits
the
identical
offense
in
the
same
place
goes
through
a
very
different
procedure
and
is
subject
to
the
very
different
law
applicable
in
federal
court.
i
take
that
petitioner
would
not
deny
the
accuracy
of
his
description.
he
is
already
confirmed
it,
nor
would
he
question,
he
does
not
appear
to
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
overall
jurisdictional
scheme
even
though
it
creates
a
significant
procedural
and
substantive
discrepancy
between
tribal
indians
and
other
persons.
indeed,
the
overall
scheme
has
been
confirmed
too
many
times
by
this
court
to
lend
credence
to
an
answer
that
mere
categorization
of
an
indian
in
a
federal
statute
is
unconstitutional.
rather
he
attacks
one
very
specific
aspect
of
this
discrepancy
which
results
inevitably
from
the
congressional
allocation
of
jurisdiction
between
the
federal
and
tribal
courts
in
this
area.
simply
stated,
if
an
indian
is
on
trial
in
the
federal
court
for
one
of
the
offenses
enumerated
in
the
major
crimes
act,
neither
her
nor
the
government
is
entitled
to
ask
the
court
for
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
even
if
otherwise
appropriate,
unless
the
lesser
included
offense
happens
to
be
one
of
the
other
offenses
specifically
enumerated
in
the
major
crimes
act
because
the
federal
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
try
and
punish
an
indian
for
commissions
of
any
offense
not
specifically
enumerated
in
the
act.
and
with
respect
to
a
non-indian
with
the
same
situation,
of
course,
it
may
be
appropriate
and
probably
would
have
been
appropriate
here
to
instruct
the
jury
that
if
it
finds
him
innocent
of
the
major
offense
charged,
it
may
still
find
him
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
now,
there
are
essentially
two
arguments
raised.
one,
petitioner
argues
that
alternatively
that
the
major
crimes
act
itself
allows
the
lesser
included
offense
charge.
i
think
that
with
my
time
running
short,
i
shall
leave
that
statutory
argument
essentially
to
the
brief
in
which
we
answer
it
fully.
basically,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
somewhat
unusual
for
the
government
to
be
in
the
position
of
arguing
a
strict
construction
in
non-presence
of
a
federal
crime
against
a
criminal
defendant
who
argues
that
something
is
a
federal
crime,
but
we
have
i
think
tried
our
best
to
bind
ourselves
by
the
very
strict
rule
of
statutory
construction
applicable
in
a
criminal
context.
generally,
the
crimes
ought
not
to
be
construed
and
that
a
federal
crime
should
not
be
read
by
implication
into
a
very
specifically
worded
statute.
i
think
that
that
presumption
applies
with
double
force.
in
this
context
where
congress
has
specifically
and
repeatedly
said
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
sovereignty
can
be
only
be
eliminated
by
very
specific
congressional
mandate
and
indeed
congress
has
tiptoed
step
by
step
by
step
in
amending
the
major
crimes
act
to
include
offenses
on
a
very
carefully
considered
basis
and
it
would
be
highly
contrary
to
the
history
of
that
act
and
its
amendments
to
conclude
that
any
crime
is
created
by
mere
implication.
so
i
would,
with
the
court’s
permission
like
to
focus
on
the
constitutional
problem.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
marshall,
i’m
sorry
but
i
don’t
understand
that?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
no
not
the
assimilative
statute,
in
the
major
crimes
act.
they
went
step-by-step
with
respect
to
which
offenses
at
each
point
would
be
considered
serious
enough
so
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
sorry
i
don’t
understand
the
question?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
assume
that
what
those
statutes
were
enacted
with
regard
to
the
question
of
what
jurisdiction
should
be
left
in
what
places
and
to
the
extent
that
they
involved
indians,
they
involved
consideration
of
what
crime
should
be
left
to
the
indian
courts.
and
the
essential
conclusion
was
as
reflected
in
the
statutory
scheme
that
what
should
be
left
at
the
tribal
courts
are
crimes
between
indians,
by
and
against
indians
committed
on
reservations
with
the
exception
of
certain
major
crimes
with
respect
to
which
congress
felt
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
with
respect
to
each
congress
felt
that
it
was
--
the
crimes
were
so
major
that
the
interest
in
severe
enough
punishment,
the
assurance
of
severe
punishment
of
those
major
crimes
was
sufficient
to
withdraw
jurisdiction
or
to
withdraw
exclusive
jurisdiction
from
the
tribal
courts
for
any
of
those
offenses.
but
with
respect
to
all
other
crimes,
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
history
of
the
act
that
congress
very
much
intended
that
for
the
same
reasons
that
it
always
left
these
to
the
tribal
courts,
they
were
to
be
left
at
this
point
to
the
tribal
courts.
therefore,
in
suggesting
that
this
issue
should
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
entire
statutory
scheme
by
which
congress
has
attempted
to
reconcile
the
conflicting
elements
of
tribal
indian
status,
a
scheme
which
quite
explicitly
results
in
some
situations
in
disparate
legal
treatment
of
persons
merely
on
the
ground
that
they
are
not
indians.
we
think
that
the
rationale
is
that
of
the
entire
scheme
essentially
governing
the
tribal
court
system
and
the
allocation
of
jurisdiction.
this
is
one
minor
example
of
it
but
the
entire
scheme
is
a
preservation
of
the
sovereignty
of
tribal
courts
at
least
with
respect
to
offenses
not
enumerated
in
the
major
crimes
act
between
and
against
--
by
and
against
indians
committed
on
reservations.
and
congress
as
including
in
its
passage
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968,
the
indian
bill
of
rights
in
1968,
congress
has
studied
carefully
this
question
and
has
concluded
that
the
preservation
of
the
tribal
court
system
is
essentially
of
great
benefit
to
indians
that
field
studies
and
commentators
have
shown
that
many
indians
feel
that
they
get
a
more
a
fair
and
more
equitable
treatment.
even
thought
they
don’t
get
the
whole
panoply
of
federal
procedures
and
federal
constitutional
safeguards.
they
feel
that
the
penalties
are
more
lenient
that
the
justice
is
more
in
harmony
with
their
cultural
concept
of
justice.
it
is
essentially
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
--
restitution
rather
than
on
retribution
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
go
nearly
that
far
and
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
it
all
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
in
this
case,
i
go
--
i
think
we
go
not
very
far
at
all
because
i
think
the
discrepancy
between
which
we
deal
with
here,
which
is
that
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
is
available
to
an
indian
--
to
a
non-indian
defendant
in
this
case,
but
not
to
an
indian
defendant
is
a
very
minor
price
to
pay
for
upholding
the
very
major
rationale
that
congress
has
consistently
reinforced
of
preserving
tribal
sovereignty
for
number
of
reasons.
(a)
it
is
in
any
context,
very
speculative
from
the
defendant’s
point
of
view
whether
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
is
beneficial
to
him,
theoretically,
it’s
only
a
benefit
if
the
jury
doesn’t
follow
its
instructions
and
it
maybe
perfectly
proper
for
the
jury
to
administer
mercy
in
some
sorts
of
situations,
particularly
where
there
are
a
marginal,
where
the
evidence
is
marginal
which
we
don’t
think
it
was
in
this
case.
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
that
the
requisite
intent
and
the
requisite
amount
of
damage
occurred,
but
it
is
any
event
a
rather
speculative
benefit
from
the
defendant’s
point
of
view
any
way.
the
lesser
included
offense
charge
arose
because
the
prosecutor
might
be
barred
by
double
jeopardy
from
bringing
lesser
included
--
entirely
included
offenses
in
successive
prosecutions.
and
it
was
to
enable
him
to
put
the
lesser
included
offense
before
the
jury
so
that
there
would
be
some
sort
of
conviction
if
the
jury
acquitted
him
of
that
major
offense.
now,
we
don’t
argue
that
it’s
not
available
and
that
in
some
cases,
it
would
be
reversible
error
to
deny
it
to
a
criminal
litigant,
but
the
question
is
in
a
constitutional
context,
in
an
equal
protection
argument,
we
must
ask
how
important
in
interest
is
it,
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
speculative
interest.
particularly
in
this
context,
where
as
judge
kaufman
suggested
in
the
second
circuit
in
a
related
case
involving
a
split
between
adult
and
juvenile
jurisdiction,
where
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
was
not
available
to
a
juvenile
who
could
be
convicted
of
murder
in
an
adult
court,
but
a
man
slaughter
only
on
a
juvenile
proceeding,
judge
kaufman
suggested
something
that
would’ve
been
perfectly
applicable
here
though
it
wasn’t
asked
for,
and
that
could
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
and
that
is
a
charge
to
the
effect
that
even
if
you,
the
jury
in
this
federal
proceeding,
acquit
this
indian
of
the
charge
with
which
he
is
--
which
is
brought
against
in
here,
he
is
not
necessarily
going
to
go
free
from
the
occurrences
in
this
transaction.
he
could
be
tried.
there
is
another
tribunal
which
can
try
him
for
any
lesser
included
offense
or
other
aspects
at
all
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
as
to
whether
he
can
be
tried
in
this
--
i
think
it
doesn’t
mr.
justice
brennan.
a
body
in
barkus,
i
think
would
apply
here.
in
fact
the
body
in
barkus
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
separate
sovereignty
and
we
would
argue
that
they
are,
but
let
me
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right
and
well,
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
been
presented
on
certiorari
and
certiorari
has
been
denied.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
in
the
case
that
it
was
presented,
it
was
not
necessarily
an
issue.
it
was
an
alternative
issue.
let
me
say,
that
even
that
does
not
have
to
be
fully
decided
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
even
what
--
regardless
of
what
the
court
that
hold
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
brennan.
those
distinctions
have
not
thought
applicable.
the
cfr
and
other
aspects
of
federal
participation
or
assistance
to
indian
justice
have
not
been
thought
to
remove
the
underlying
sovereign
right
with
which
indian
justice
is
administered.
let
me
make
a
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
answer
it
as
i
would
in
any
context
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
discrimination
is
only
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
is
invidious
rationally.
it
is
not
invidious,
if
it
is
based
on
a
rational
basis.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
absolutely
not
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
--
but
neither
is
the
entire
federal
regulatory
scheme
governing
indians.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
you
can
do
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
with
all
respect.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
you
can
isolate
one
case
and
say,
here,
it
is
speculative
that
he
may
have
suffered
some
sort
of
harm
as
a
result
to
this
--
of
this
classification.
i
think
you
have
to
ask
is
the
classification
rational.
that’s
--
this
is
the
situation
i
think
in
every
case
where
an
equal
protection
argument
is
raised.
i
would
like
to
get
back
for
one
second
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
and
to
say
why
i
don’t
think
the
issue
of
double
jeopardy,
the
barkus,
where
this
court
has
to
necessarily
decide
that
for
all
purposes,
indian
and
federal
jurisdiction
are
separate
sovereignties,
though
indeed
we
believe
they
are
because
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
question
is
really
only
important
to
the
issue
whether
it
is
true
that
if
acquitted
on
the
major
charge
in
this
case,
this
defendant
could
be
then
to
retried
on
a
lesser
included
charge
in
the
tribal
court.
and
i
would
argue
that
even
if
they
are
not
separate
sovereignties
for
all
purposes
with
respect
to
that
question,
the
answer
would
be
that
double
jeopardy
is
inapplicable
because
that
particular
branch
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
as
opposed
say
from
the
collateral
estoppel
problem
or
from
the
problem
of
double
punishment
for
two
convictions
for
the
same
offense,
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
a
prosecutor
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
go
down
the
line
in
piecemeal
harassment
--
harassing
fashion,
and
it
is
designed
to
prevent
him
from
abusing
his
discretion
to
go
down
the
line
and
continue
to
punish
or
try
to
punish
for
each
successive
crimes
and
that’s
inapplicable
here
because
he
has
no
jurisdiction
to
go
down
the
line.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
conceivably
mr.
justice,
that
would
be
a
lot
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
would
be
--
in
that
case
i
am
must
rely
on
the
argument
of
separate
sovereignties.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
reiterate
that
this
case
must
be
viewed
i
think
as
one
isolated
and
not
be
terribly
significant
aspect
of
discrepancies
which
inevitably
arise
from
this
very,
very
complex
effort
to
accommodate
the
conflicting
in
differing
elements
of
indian
status
that
the
result
of
declaring
this
particular
discrepancy
unconstitutional
would
be
very
short
sighted
and
unwise
from
this
court’s
point
of
view.
it
would
be
either
at
the
very
least,
it
would
force
congress
--
force
upon
congress
this
court’s
judgment
that
a
rationale
which
has
been
repeatedly
upheld
by
the
federal
courts
and
repeatedly
considered,
studied
and
re-endorsed
by
congress
to
preserve
the
sovereignty
of
indian
tribal
courts
where
congress
deems
it
applicable
is
in
sufficient
to
offset
discrepancy
with
respect
to
what
is
really
a
very
speculative
disadvantage
that
an
indian
may,
and
particularly
an
indian
in
a
particular
case
may
with
hindsight
think
he
has
suffered
and
i
would
recommend
that
the
court
affirm
this
decision.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
which
this
case
presents
is
one
of
a
broad
range
of
issues
arising
in
both
the
civil
and
criminal
contexts
which
have
required
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
to
reconcile
in
some
viable
manner,
the
extremely
complex
conflicting
elements
of
the
status
of
tribal
reservation
indians.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
recognize
there
were
countless
this
morning
with
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
indeed
i
understand
that
and
it’s
a
terribly
complex
problem.
the
conflicting
elements
at
least
as
the
relevant
to
this
case
in
their
basic
form
are
quite
well
known
i
will
not
dwell
on
them.
on
the
one
hand
the
reservation
indian
has
historically
been
regarded
as
a
member
of
a
separate
sovereignty
and
although
congress
within
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there’s
no
question
mr.
justice
marshall
that
they
get
a
different
trial
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
and
it
is
that
discrepancy
which
i
claim
to
deal
with
in
the
course
of
this
argument.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
indeed
it
could.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
then
they
cannot
be
tried
in
the
federal
court
and
are
tried
only
in
the
tribal
court.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
there
are
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
are
myriad
of
splits
mr.
justice
stewart,
between
the
federal
court,
the
state
court
and
the
tribal
court
and
they
do
without
question
depend
on
racial
categorizations,
there’s
no
question
on
that.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
and
with
the
victim
as
well.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
sometimes
with
respect
to
the
victim
and
there
is
a
myriad
of
very
complicated
jurisdictional
allocations.
we
deal
here
with
a
relatively
simple
one
and
i
would
like
as
much
as
possible
to
confine
this
inquiry.
i
think
it
would
be
most
useful
to
the
relatively
clear
jurisdictional
allocation
in
dispute
here.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
that’s
a
complicated
question
mr.
justice
marshall.
you
may
conceivably
and
i
do
think
there’s
any
reason
to
get
into
this
case.
you
may
have
to
be,
not
only
prove
that
you
have
a
drop
of
any
blood
but
more
than
that
and
you
may
have
to
prove
that
you’ve
got
this,
the
right
kind
of
drop
of
blood
and
you
member
of
this
particular
tribe
that
resides
on
this
reservation.
but
i
think
that
those
questions
are
much
of
the
periphery
of
this
particular
inquiry
which
is
quite
important
to
focus
on
precisely
what
it
is.
as
i
say,
this
concept
that
indian
sovereignty
is
limited
to
some
extent
within
certain
broad
boundaries
by
congress’s
power
to
redefine
and
narrow
the
scope
of
indian
tribal
sovereignty
through
the
passage
of
legislation.
nonetheless,
the
court
has
consistently
recognized
for
hundreds
of
years
that
tribal
sovereignty
springs
from
independent
roots
that
it
retains
a
life
and
force
of
its
own
and
that
its
residual
effects
can
only
be
eliminated
through
very
explicit
congressional
action,
and
it
was
on
this
basis
that
the
court
decided
in
ex
parte
crow
dog
at
109
u.s.
that
the
federal
courts
had
no
jurisdiction,
absent
a
specific
statute
over
the
murder
of
an
indian
by
another
indian
on
the
reservation
because
congress
had
never
withdrawn
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
a
such
an
offense
from
the
sovereign
tribe.
and
then
again
as
recently
as
1970
in
the
kennelly
case,
the
court
very
strictly
construed
a
federal
statute,
authorizing
the
tribes
to
see
their
civil
jurisdiction
over
matters
arising
on
the
reservation
and
in
short
the
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
those
aspects
of
tribal
sovereignty
of
which
congress
has
not
very
explicitly
withdrawn
or
still
in
full
force.
on
the
other
hand,
and
this
is
where
the
particular
difficulty
in
this
case
arises,
since
1924
all
indians,
including
those
residing
on
reservations
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
government
and
tribal
courts
had
been
considered
united
states
citizens
who
enjoy
the
same
privileges
and
rights
conferred
by
that
status
which
other
united
states
citizens
enjoy.
the
inherent
conflict
between
these
two
elements
of
indians
status
is
obvious
enough
to
the
extent
that
the
tribal
indian
remains
subject
to
the
governmental
authority
of
the
sovereign
tribal
group
to
which
he
belongs.
he
inevitably
finds
that
merely
because
he
is
a
tribal
indian,
he
enjoys
certain
privileges
and
incurs
certain
legal
obligations
which
are
not
shared
by
other
american
citizens.
one
example
of
this
which
we
have
alluded
to
already
in
this
argument
and
which
seems
to
me
crucially
relevant
to
an
understanding
of
the
particular
discrepancy
with
respect
to
which
petitioner
complains
here,
is
it
the
tribal
indian
who
commits
a
crime
against
another
indian
on
the
reservation
is
punishable
exclusively
in
the
tribal
court,
unless
the
crime
is
one
of
those
with
respect
to
which
congress
has
specifically
delegated
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
or
state
courts
as
for
example
in
the
major
crimes
act.
though
congress
has
repeatedly
found,
as
i
shall
discuss
shortly,
that
the
preservation
of
the
tribal
court
system
is
of
great
benefit
to
reservation
indians,
subjection
to
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction,
appears
to
have
elements
in
some
cases
of
both
comparative
advantage
and
comparative
at
least
theoretical
disadvantage
to
the
tribal
indian.
aside
for
example
from
the
comfort
which
he
may
derive
for
being
judged
by
this
tribal
brothers
in
a
proceeding
that
is
meaningful
and
familiar
to
him
and
to
his
culture,
the
commentators
appear
to
agree
that
he
is
likely
to
receive
a
considerably
smaller
penalty
if
he
is
convicted
in
the
tribal
court.
in
this
case
for
example
the
penalty
which
the
tribal
court
imposed
for
the
actions
leading
to
the
charge
at
issue
here
was
15
days
incarceration
essentially
for
public
intoxication
and
a
fine
of
$20.00.
on
the
other
hand,
the
tribal
court
does
not
offer
the
panoply
of
procedural
rights
and
protections
which
a
non-indian
citizen
would
enjoy,
if
he
were
being
tried
for
the
same
offense
in
a
state
or
federal
court.
indeed
prior
to
1968,
congress
imposed
virtually
no
requirements
whatsoever
on
the
tribal
courts
and
with
minor
exceptions
the
federal
courts
held
that
because
of
the
continued
concept
of
tribal
sovereignty,
this
discrepancy
did
not
offend
the
constitution.
in
1968,
as
the
court
knows,
congress
passed
the
indian
bill
of
rights
which
imposed
on
the
tribal
courts
at
least
a
scalable
version,
the
outlines
of
which
had
not
yet
been
adjudicated
of
the
rights
enumerated
in
the
first
10
amendments
to
the
constitution,
but
that
was
presumably
not
by
constitutional
mandate,
but
part
of
congress’s
decision
to
slowly
integrate
the
indian
tribal
system
into
the
concept
of
justice
and
inherent
in
rest
of
the
country.
indeed,
the
indian
bill
of
rights,
we
would
suggest
is
representative
of
a
pattern
that
has
been
very
wisely
followed
in
the
reconciliation
of
the
conflicting
elements
of
the
indian
status.
a
few
federal
court
of
appeals
in
years
immediately
prior
to
the
passage
of
that
act
had
indicated
some
impatience
with
the
slow
movement
of
tribal
courts
in
the
direction
of
affording
traditional
constitutional
protections
to
criminal
defendants
and
it
had
been
suggested
in
at
least
one
case
that
a
proceeding
in
a
tribal
court
might
be
reviewable
in
the
federal
courts
on
the
ground
that
the
tribal
court
was
obligated
to
provide
at
least
some
constitutional
procedure.
it’s
rather
awkward
doctrine
for
a
court
to
be
applying
because
it
applies
a
piecemeal
with
no
ascertainable
standard
constitutional
protections
rather
than
applying
it
across
the
board.
but
it
was
recognized
even
in
that
case
that
congress
is
the
appropriate
body
and
is
in
a
lesser
awkward
and
more
appropriate
decision
to
determine
the
details
of
the
plan
by
which
tribal
justice
can
be
integrated
into
the
american
constitutional
system
in
a
manner
that
preserves
to
the
extent
congress
deems
desirable
both
to
sovereign
rights
of
the
tribal
government
and
the
rights
owed
to
indians
as
citizens
of
united
states.
and
so
congress
has
repeatedly
responded
in
all
areas
related
to
this
case
not
with
a
mechanical
across
the
board
application
of
constitutional
requirements
on
the
tribal
court
system,
but
with
the
set
of
requirements
which
the
congress
considers
viable
in
terms
of
preserving
the
basic
nature
of
those
courts.
now,
this
case
presents
this
court
with
another
closely
related
aspect
of
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
status
of
indians
as
citizens
and
their
status
as
members
of
a
separate
sovereignty.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
have
two
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
this
is
a
certainly
a
problem
mr.
justice
burger,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don’t
have
a
full
answer
to
it.
it
hasn’t
been
raised
before
and
it
is
been
accepted
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
that
these
two
offenses
are
sufficiently
related
so
that
the
major
crimes
act
confers
the
jurisdiction
under
the
south
dakota
law
to
try
for
assault
with
intent
to
commit
the
crime.
i
have
two
answers
in
mitigation
of
the
very
obvious
objection
that
there
may
be
an
element
required
in
the
major
crimes
act
which
is
not
required
under
south
dakota
law
to
with
their
element
of
actual
serious
bodily
damage
and
that
would
be
the
objection.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
offense
in
south
dakota
of
assault
with
intent
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm
is
prosecuted
in
practice
unless
there
is
in
fact
a
great
bodily
harm,
and
the
other
answer
to
that
is
in
this
case
it
is
entirely
undisputed
on
the
record
and
i
do
not
believe
petitioner
would
dispute
that
the
actual
incident
here
resulted
in
great
bodily
harm.
i
doubt
that
the
federal
government
would
have
prosecuted
had
it
not
resulted
in
great
bodily
harm
and
i
simply
believe
the
theoretical
possibility
of
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
great
bodily
harm
but
perhaps
a
proof
that
there
was
an
intent
on
successfully
carried
out
to
cause
great
bodily
harm
as
an
open
question.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
sorry
i
don’t
understand
the
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
because
that
is
the
way
the
state
statute
is
defined
but
as
i
say,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
state
statute
is
ever
applicable
except
where
in
fact
the
harm
resulted.
indeed,
it’s
an
interesting
it
may
work
just
the
other
way
because
they
may
well
be
great
bodily
harm
which
would
satisfy
the
wording
of
1153
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
--
without
the
requisite
intent
and
it
simply
intend
to
cause
assault
at
all
might
arguably
be
sufficient
to
carry
forward
even
if
no
bodily
harm
were
intended
but
great
bodily
harm
resulted,
but
on
the
context
of
this
case,
i
do
not
think
the
issue
was
raised,
not
only
because
it
has
been
raised
below
but
because
everybody’s
total
agreement
not
only
great
bodily,
but
death
as
a
result
of
this
serious
incidents.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
that’s
disputed
in
the
record
but
at
least
it
was,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
victim
walked
out
in
pretty
terrible
shape,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
died
the
next
morning
and
if
there
was
some
doubt
whether
he
died
of
the
injuries
of
over-exposure.
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
probably
died
of
over-exposure,
but
there
was
other
testimony
that
he
had
been
very,
very
severely
battered.
there
was
blood
splattered
all
over
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
and
i
think
no
question
that
the
event
of
great
bodily
harm
came.
and
i
think
this
question
that
the
chief
justice
quite
aptly
raises
really
ought
to
be
--
i
do
not
think
it
would
arise
because
i
doubt
seriously
there
would
be
a
prosecution,
absent
bodily
harm,
but
if
so
i
think
that
that
problem
should
wait
to
a
case
in
which
the
objection
is
properly
raised
and
no
great
bodily
harm
was
present.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right
which
adds
it
incidentally
in
element
that
is
not
necessarily
present
in
the
federal
crime.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
intent
to
cause
great
bodily
harm
is
not
necessarily
present
in
the
federal
list
in
18
u.s.c.
1153,
only
the
actual
causing.
now,
clearly
some
type
of
intent
is
necessary.
intent
to
commit
a
battery
at
all,
but
it
isn’t
clear
that
18
u.s.c.
1153
would
ever
require
that
there
be
intent
of
actual
great
harm.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
that’s
right,
intent
to
assault
which
would
include
some
sort
of
intent
to
commit
the
assault
but
not
a
specific
intent
resulting
in
great
bodily
harm.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
you
could,
you
could
have
that
situation.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
i
don’t
think
if
it’s
just
not
present
in
this
case,
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
yes,
because
that
raises
a
problem,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
the
grant
is
worded
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
question
and
i
suppose
we
can’t
argue
that
some
preliminary
threshold
statutory
question
cannot
be
considered
here,
that
the
court
need
decide
the
constitutional
question,
absent
some
satisfactory
determination
of
the
threshold
questions
that
would
set
that
up
for
which
reason
we
have
not
objected
for
example
to
the
statutory
argument
that
the
lesser
included
defense
charge
is
constructively
provided
in
18
u.s.c.
1153
which
the
petitioner
raises.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
then
he
clearly
would
not
properly
have
been
tried
in
the
federal
court
at
all.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
you
do
have
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
you
only
have
to
leave
it
for
some
other
case
where
in
fact,
the
element
of
great
bodily
harm
is
not
present,
mr.
justice
white.
my
point,
i
understand
what
the
court’s
difficulty
is
inherently,
but
i
think
it
is
a
speculative
difficulty.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
government
would
ever
attempt
or
that
south
dakota
law
would
permit
a
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
it
was
a
jury
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
instructions
deal
with
the
element
of
intent
and
do
not
specifically
require
a
finding
of
actual
harm
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
that
is
because
the
sole
defense
raised
that
the
trial
was
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
intent
and
it
was
admitted
throughout
the
trial
that
great
bodily
harm
had
occurred.
it
was
never
in
question
so
i
guess
it
wasn’t
raised.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
we
wouldn’t
necessarily
say
that
he
got
a
better
break
but
that
he
was
put
to
no
advantage
because
the
government
proved
with
no
possible
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
have
no
further
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
white
except
for
the
fact
i
think
a
reading
of
this
record
and
attention
to
both
petitioners
charged
to
himself,
requested
to
charge
himself
and
to
the
evidence
presented
would
reveal
no
conceivable
question
about
that
and
i
recognize
the
difficulty
of
assuming
a
directed
verdict
type
of
assumption
in
the
criminal
context,
but
i
think
that
the
presence
of
great
bodily
harm
is
as
conclusively
present
and
undisputed
in
the
context
that
this
case
as
it
could
possibly
be.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
it
deals
with
it
by
a
citation,
mr.
justice
stewart
of
the
nordelo
case
which
implies
that
when
in
a
criminal
context
generally,
the
federal
government
incorporates
a
state
definition
of
a
crime
that
it
really
only
incorporates
the
substantive
definition
and
not
necessarily
the
labels.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
have
some
question
as
to
how
far
we
can
take
that
in
this
case
to
the
extent
that
there
really
is
an
underlying
substantive
definitional
problem.
we
cited
as
i
recall
as
a
c
cite
and
it
is
suggestive
of
a
notion
that
i
think
it’s
hard
to
bring
too
far,
except
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
element
is
so
clearly
present
that
we
really
are
i
think
only
talking
about
by
this
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that
is
right,
but
i
have
some,
at
least
slight
reluctance
to
answer
to
i
believe
to
mr.
justice
white’s
suggestion
that
the
element,
there’s
no
question
about
it,
but
then
it
wasn’t
submitted
to
the
jury
and
i
recognize
that
it
is
difficult
to.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
he
charges
that
he
wasn't
--
he
doesn’t
specifically
say
that
he
is
not
charged
with
causing
serious
injuries
as
he
isn’t
charged
with
intent
to
kill.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
would
submit
with
all
deference
that
i
have
no
further
response
to
that
question
except
that
i
think
that
the
difficulty
which
is
raised
here
might
be
a
difficulty
in
another,
but
it
is
not
a
difficulty
in
this
case
and
ought
not
to
deter
this
court
from
reaching
the
merits
of
the
underlying
issue
that’s
presented.
as
i
say,
this
case
presents
the
court
with
an
isolated
aspect
of
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
status
of
indians
as
citizens
and
as
members
of
separate
sovereignty.
the
problem
arises
because
congress
has
determined
that
a
tribal
indian
who
commits
certain
major
crimes
against
another
indian
on
a
reservation
is
tried
in
the
same
manner
subject
to
the
same
penalty
as
a
non-indian
committing
the
identical
offense
and
yet
on
the
other
hand,
congress
has
determined
that
with
respect
to
all
other
crimes
not
listed
in
the
major
crimes
act,
a
tribal
indian
remains
subject
exclusively
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
court.
even
though
admittedly
his
non-indian
fellow
citizen
who
commits
the
identical
offense
in
the
same
place
goes
through
a
very
different
procedure
and
is
subject
to
the
very
different
law
applicable
in
federal
court.
i
take
that
petitioner
would
not
deny
the
accuracy
of
his
description.
he
is
already
confirmed
it,
nor
would
he
question,
he
does
not
appear
to
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
overall
jurisdictional
scheme
even
though
it
creates
a
significant
procedural
and
substantive
discrepancy
between
tribal
indians
and
other
persons.
indeed,
the
overall
scheme
has
been
confirmed
too
many
times
by
this
court
to
lend
credence
to
an
answer
that
mere
categorization
of
an
indian
in
a
federal
statute
is
unconstitutional.
rather
he
attacks
one
very
specific
aspect
of
this
discrepancy
which
results
inevitably
from
the
congressional
allocation
of
jurisdiction
between
the
federal
and
tribal
courts
in
this
area.
simply
stated,
if
an
indian
is
on
trial
in
the
federal
court
for
one
of
the
offenses
enumerated
in
the
major
crimes
act,
neither
her
nor
the
government
is
entitled
to
ask
the
court
for
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
even
if
otherwise
appropriate,
unless
the
lesser
included
offense
happens
to
be
one
of
the
other
offenses
specifically
enumerated
in
the
major
crimes
act
because
the
federal
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
try
and
punish
an
indian
for
commissions
of
any
offense
not
specifically
enumerated
in
the
act.
and
with
respect
to
a
non-indian
with
the
same
situation,
of
course,
it
may
be
appropriate
and
probably
would
have
been
appropriate
here
to
instruct
the
jury
that
if
it
finds
him
innocent
of
the
major
offense
charged,
it
may
still
find
him
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
now,
there
are
essentially
two
arguments
raised.
one,
petitioner
argues
that
alternatively
that
the
major
crimes
act
itself
allows
the
lesser
included
offense
charge.
i
think
that
with
my
time
running
short,
i
shall
leave
that
statutory
argument
essentially
to
the
brief
in
which
we
answer
it
fully.
basically,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
somewhat
unusual
for
the
government
to
be
in
the
position
of
arguing
a
strict
construction
in
non-presence
of
a
federal
crime
against
a
criminal
defendant
who
argues
that
something
is
a
federal
crime,
but
we
have
i
think
tried
our
best
to
bind
ourselves
by
the
very
strict
rule
of
statutory
construction
applicable
in
a
criminal
context.
generally,
the
crimes
ought
not
to
be
construed
and
that
a
federal
crime
should
not
be
read
by
implication
into
a
very
specifically
worded
statute.
i
think
that
that
presumption
applies
with
double
force.
in
this
context
where
congress
has
specifically
and
repeatedly
said
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
sovereignty
can
be
only
be
eliminated
by
very
specific
congressional
mandate
and
indeed
congress
has
tiptoed
step
by
step
by
step
in
amending
the
major
crimes
act
to
include
offenses
on
a
very
carefully
considered
basis
and
it
would
be
highly
contrary
to
the
history
of
that
act
and
its
amendments
to
conclude
that
any
crime
is
created
by
mere
implication.
so
i
would,
with
the
court’s
permission
like
to
focus
on
the
constitutional
problem.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
marshall,
i’m
sorry
but
i
don’t
understand
that?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
no
not
the
assimilative
statute,
in
the
major
crimes
act.
they
went
step-by-step
with
respect
to
which
offenses
at
each
point
would
be
considered
serious
enough
so
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
sorry
i
don’t
understand
the
question?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
assume
that
what
those
statutes
were
enacted
with
regard
to
the
question
of
what
jurisdiction
should
be
left
in
what
places
and
to
the
extent
that
they
involved
indians,
they
involved
consideration
of
what
crime
should
be
left
to
the
indian
courts.
and
the
essential
conclusion
was
as
reflected
in
the
statutory
scheme
that
what
should
be
left
at
the
tribal
courts
are
crimes
between
indians,
by
and
against
indians
committed
on
reservations
with
the
exception
of
certain
major
crimes
with
respect
to
which
congress
felt
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
with
respect
to
each
congress
felt
that
it
was
--
the
crimes
were
so
major
that
the
interest
in
severe
enough
punishment,
the
assurance
of
severe
punishment
of
those
major
crimes
was
sufficient
to
withdraw
jurisdiction
or
to
withdraw
exclusive
jurisdiction
from
the
tribal
courts
for
any
of
those
offenses.
but
with
respect
to
all
other
crimes,
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
history
of
the
act
that
congress
very
much
intended
that
for
the
same
reasons
that
it
always
left
these
to
the
tribal
courts,
they
were
to
be
left
at
this
point
to
the
tribal
courts.
therefore,
in
suggesting
that
this
issue
should
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
entire
statutory
scheme
by
which
congress
has
attempted
to
reconcile
the
conflicting
elements
of
tribal
indian
status,
a
scheme
which
quite
explicitly
results
in
some
situations
in
disparate
legal
treatment
of
persons
merely
on
the
ground
that
they
are
not
indians.
we
think
that
the
rationale
is
that
of
the
entire
scheme
essentially
governing
the
tribal
court
system
and
the
allocation
of
jurisdiction.
this
is
one
minor
example
of
it
but
the
entire
scheme
is
a
preservation
of
the
sovereignty
of
tribal
courts
at
least
with
respect
to
offenses
not
enumerated
in
the
major
crimes
act
between
and
against
--
by
and
against
indians
committed
on
reservations.
and
congress
as
including
in
its
passage
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968,
the
indian
bill
of
rights
in
1968,
congress
has
studied
carefully
this
question
and
has
concluded
that
the
preservation
of
the
tribal
court
system
is
essentially
of
great
benefit
to
indians
that
field
studies
and
commentators
have
shown
that
many
indians
feel
that
they
get
a
more
a
fair
and
more
equitable
treatment.
even
thought
they
don’t
get
the
whole
panoply
of
federal
procedures
and
federal
constitutional
safeguards.
they
feel
that
the
penalties
are
more
lenient
that
the
justice
is
more
in
harmony
with
their
cultural
concept
of
justice.
it
is
essentially
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
--
restitution
rather
than
on
retribution
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
go
nearly
that
far
and
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
it
all
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
in
this
case,
i
go
--
i
think
we
go
not
very
far
at
all
because
i
think
the
discrepancy
between
which
we
deal
with
here,
which
is
that
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
is
available
to
an
indian
--
to
a
non-indian
defendant
in
this
case,
but
not
to
an
indian
defendant
is
a
very
minor
price
to
pay
for
upholding
the
very
major
rationale
that
congress
has
consistently
reinforced
of
preserving
tribal
sovereignty
for
number
of
reasons.
(a)
it
is
in
any
context,
very
speculative
from
the
defendant’s
point
of
view
whether
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
is
beneficial
to
him,
theoretically,
it’s
only
a
benefit
if
the
jury
doesn’t
follow
its
instructions
and
it
maybe
perfectly
proper
for
the
jury
to
administer
mercy
in
some
sorts
of
situations,
particularly
where
there
are
a
marginal,
where
the
evidence
is
marginal
which
we
don’t
think
it
was
in
this
case.
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
that
the
requisite
intent
and
the
requisite
amount
of
damage
occurred,
but
it
is
any
event
a
rather
speculative
benefit
from
the
defendant’s
point
of
view
any
way.
the
lesser
included
offense
charge
arose
because
the
prosecutor
might
be
barred
by
double
jeopardy
from
bringing
lesser
included
--
entirely
included
offenses
in
successive
prosecutions.
and
it
was
to
enable
him
to
put
the
lesser
included
offense
before
the
jury
so
that
there
would
be
some
sort
of
conviction
if
the
jury
acquitted
him
of
that
major
offense.
now,
we
don’t
argue
that
it’s
not
available
and
that
in
some
cases,
it
would
be
reversible
error
to
deny
it
to
a
criminal
litigant,
but
the
question
is
in
a
constitutional
context,
in
an
equal
protection
argument,
we
must
ask
how
important
in
interest
is
it,
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
speculative
interest.
particularly
in
this
context,
where
as
judge
kaufman
suggested
in
the
second
circuit
in
a
related
case
involving
a
split
between
adult
and
juvenile
jurisdiction,
where
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
was
not
available
to
a
juvenile
who
could
be
convicted
of
murder
in
an
adult
court,
but
a
man
slaughter
only
on
a
juvenile
proceeding,
judge
kaufman
suggested
something
that
would’ve
been
perfectly
applicable
here
though
it
wasn’t
asked
for,
and
that
could
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
and
that
is
a
charge
to
the
effect
that
even
if
you,
the
jury
in
this
federal
proceeding,
acquit
this
indian
of
the
charge
with
which
he
is
--
which
is
brought
against
in
here,
he
is
not
necessarily
going
to
go
free
from
the
occurrences
in
this
transaction.
he
could
be
tried.
there
is
another
tribunal
which
can
try
him
for
any
lesser
included
offense
or
other
aspects
at
all
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
as
to
whether
he
can
be
tried
in
this
--
i
think
it
doesn’t
mr.
justice
brennan.
a
body
in
barkus,
i
think
would
apply
here.
in
fact
the
body
in
barkus
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
separate
sovereignty
and
we
would
argue
that
they
are,
but
let
me
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right
and
well,
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
been
presented
on
certiorari
and
certiorari
has
been
denied.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
in
the
case
that
it
was
presented,
it
was
not
necessarily
an
issue.
it
was
an
alternative
issue.
let
me
say,
that
even
that
does
not
have
to
be
fully
decided
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
even
what
--
regardless
of
what
the
court
that
hold
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
brennan.
those
distinctions
have
not
thought
applicable.
the
cfr
and
other
aspects
of
federal
participation
or
assistance
to
indian
justice
have
not
been
thought
to
remove
the
underlying
sovereign
right
with
which
indian
justice
is
administered.
let
me
make
a
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
answer
it
as
i
would
in
any
context
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
discrimination
is
only
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
is
invidious
rationally.
it
is
not
invidious,
if
it
is
based
on
a
rational
basis.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
absolutely
not
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
--
but
neither
is
the
entire
federal
regulatory
scheme
governing
indians.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
you
can
do
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
with
all
respect.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
you
can
isolate
one
case
and
say,
here,
it
is
speculative
that
he
may
have
suffered
some
sort
of
harm
as
a
result
to
this
--
of
this
classification.
i
think
you
have
to
ask
is
the
classification
rational.
that’s
--
this
is
the
situation
i
think
in
every
case
where
an
equal
protection
argument
is
raised.
i
would
like
to
get
back
for
one
second
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
and
to
say
why
i
don’t
think
the
issue
of
double
jeopardy,
the
barkus,
where
this
court
has
to
necessarily
decide
that
for
all
purposes,
indian
and
federal
jurisdiction
are
separate
sovereignties,
though
indeed
we
believe
they
are
because
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
question
is
really
only
important
to
the
issue
whether
it
is
true
that
if
acquitted
on
the
major
charge
in
this
case,
this
defendant
could
be
then
to
retried
on
a
lesser
included
charge
in
the
tribal
court.
and
i
would
argue
that
even
if
they
are
not
separate
sovereignties
for
all
purposes
with
respect
to
that
question,
the
answer
would
be
that
double
jeopardy
is
inapplicable
because
that
particular
branch
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
as
opposed
say
from
the
collateral
estoppel
problem
or
from
the
problem
of
double
punishment
for
two
convictions
for
the
same
offense,
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
a
prosecutor
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
go
down
the
line
in
piecemeal
harassment
--
harassing
fashion,
and
it
is
designed
to
prevent
him
from
abusing
his
discretion
to
go
down
the
line
and
continue
to
punish
or
try
to
punish
for
each
successive
crimes
and
that’s
inapplicable
here
because
he
has
no
jurisdiction
to
go
down
the
line.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
conceivably
mr.
justice,
that
would
be
a
lot
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
would
be
--
in
that
case
i
am
must
rely
on
the
argument
of
separate
sovereignties.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
reiterate
that
this
case
must
be
viewed
i
think
as
one
isolated
and
not
be
terribly
significant
aspect
of
discrepancies
which
inevitably
arise
from
this
very,
very
complex
effort
to
accommodate
the
conflicting
in
differing
elements
of
indian
status
that
the
result
of
declaring
this
particular
discrepancy
unconstitutional
would
be
very
short
sighted
and
unwise
from
this
court’s
point
of
view.
it
would
be
either
at
the
very
least,
it
would
force
congress
--
force
upon
congress
this
court’s
judgment
that
a
rationale
which
has
been
repeatedly
upheld
by
the
federal
courts
and
repeatedly
considered,
studied
and
re-endorsed
by
congress
to
preserve
the
sovereignty
of
indian
tribal
courts
where
congress
deems
it
applicable
is
in
sufficient
to
offset
discrepancy
with
respect
to
what
is
really
a
very
speculative
disadvantage
that
an
indian
may,
and
particularly
an
indian
in
a
particular
case
may
with
hindsight
think
he
has
suffered
and
i
would
recommend
that
the
court
affirm
this
decision.
