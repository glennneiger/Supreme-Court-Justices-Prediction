mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
supreme
court
from
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
issued
a
split
decision,
affirming
judge
neckel
of
the
district
of
south
dakota.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
basically
that
this
crime
was
committed
upon
an
indian
reservation
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
the
crow
creek
indian
reservation,
by
one
indian
against
another
indian.
the
indictment
was
brought
under
18
u.s.c.
1153.
there
was
a
conviction
had
on
this
crime.
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
defense
requested
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
that
was
not
given
and
the
supreme
court
on
december
4th
of
year
past,
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court’s
refusal
to
give
that
lesser
included
defense
instruction
under
18
u.s.c.
1153
violated
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
guarantee.
now
the
lesser
included
defense
instruction
that
was
requested
was
the
crime
of
assault
to
the
major
crime
of
assault
with
intent
to
do
a
great
bodily
injury.
the
defendant
in
this
case
has
two
basic
contentions.
number
one,
that
the
act
of
1885
intended
that
indians
be
tried
in
the
same
manner
and
in
the
same
courts
as
other
persons
committing
the
same
crimes
and
the
second
is,
that
if
the
petitioner’s
contention
that
this
is
incorrect
and
congress
did
not
intend
the
jurisdiction
be
present
to
convict
under
lesser
included
offense
instructions,
then
18
u.s.c.
as
applied,
violates
due
process
because
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
is
part
of
the
fundamentally
fair
trial
and
rule
31
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
so
direct.
before
i
launch
into
the
main
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
correction
as
i
see
it
in
the
government’s
brief
and
that
is
argument
2,
pages
19
to
23,
and
the
petitioner’s
view
of
that
is
not
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
present
time.
they
speak
in
their
brief
of
a
narrow
class
of
cases
which
would
lead
me
to
believe
they
think
is
13
major
crimes.
this
is
not
the
state
of
the
law
in
indian
reservations
in
the
united
states.
the
general
laws
of
the
united
states
apply
except
and
18
u.s.c.
1152
points
this
out,
“if
the
crime
is
one
indian
against
another
indian,
if
there
has
been
punishment
under
tribal
law
and
number
three,
if
the
treaty
rights
control
this
particular
point
and
a
case
cited
in
the
government’s
brief
points
this
out
which
is
the
menominee
tribe
versus
united
states
which
is
a
fishing
right
under
treaty
and
which
continues.
now
an
example
of
this
is
a
case
which
is
not
cited
in
any
brief,
united
states
versus
berlin,
441
f.2d
1199
and
this
court
denied
cert
in
that
case.
that
was
forgery
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here
when
i
am
talking
about
the
general
laws
in
the
united
states
is
that
the
assimilative
crimes
act
applies
to
indians.
that
case
so
held
that,
involved
the
conviction
out
of
montana
for
forgery
under
the
state
statute.
an
example
of
this
right
now
is
the
occurrences
which
are
in
news,
the
wounded
knee.
i
have
read
the
indictments
against
some
of
these
people.
it
is
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
it's
for
violations
of
postal
regulations,
involving
postal
things
which
the
wounded
knee
trading
post
is
also
a
post
office,
so
the
assimilated
crimes
act
does
apply.
now
the
important
thing
about
that
in
this
case
is
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
an
indian
would
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
only
when
you
are
talking
about
the
13
major
crimes,
does
he
not
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
and
as
the
government
talks
about
this
clear
pattern,
within
the
13
there
is
one
that
there
is
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
included
within
which
is
larceny
and
that
would
be
the
common
thing
of
petty
larceny,
larceny
under
$100.00
which
is
included
therein.
now
then
the
jurisdictional
part
as
the
court
is
aware,
started
with
crow
dog
which
is
in
1883
said
that
the
united
states
government
has
no
jurisdiction
over
crimes
by
one
indian
against
another
indian
on
an
indian
reservation.
out
of
that
decision
by
the
supreme
court,
the
act
of
march
3rd,
1885
set
up
the
jurisdictional
scheme
that
we
now
have
on
indian
reservations.
that
said
within
a
territory,
which
south
dakota
was
at
that
time,
within
a
territory
the
laws
of
the
territory
applied
to
all
persons,
indian
and
white
alike,
without
any
thought
of
an
indian
reservation.
therefore,
between
that
dates
1885
and
1889
in
the
territory
of
dakota,
an
indian
would
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
upon
south
dakota
becoming
a
state
in
1889,
indians
washed
this
right
because
the
second
part
of
the
act
of
1885
took
effect
which
said
that
within
a
state
if
it
happened
within
the
confines
of
an
indian
reservation
federal
law
applied,
which
of
that
kind
there
were
seven
major
crimes
defined
by
federal
law.
there
are
since
been
six
added
all
defined
by
state
law.
now
within
that
reservation
or
within
that
four-year
period,
an
indian
was
given
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
1889,
the
present
scheme
came
up
and
ever
since
then
all
the
courts
have
held
and
i’m
the
first
to
admit
that
the
case
law
and
the
petitioner's
side
is
minuscule.
no
court
has
allowed
without
being
reversed
lesser
included
offense
instructions.
however,
the
petitioner
would
point
out
that
on
page
10
of
our
brief
the
totality
of
two
statutes
now
re-codified
must
be
look
at.
they
are
18
u.s.c.
1153
and
18
u.s.c.
3242.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor.
close
reading,
in
fact
the
government
decided
the
case
united
states
versus
jacobs,
close
reading
of
that
case
reveals
that
it
was
the
government
in
that
case
that
wished
to
have
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
as
i
remember
it
was
rape
and
carnal
knowledge
or
something
of
that
matter,
but
they
have
in
the
past,
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
your
honor,
i
am
if,
the
first
point,
if
this
court
should
find
that
i
am
incorrect
and
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
give
a
lesser
included
offense
instructions
then
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
18
u.s.c.
1153
as
applied,
meaning
not
giving
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
it
violates
due
process.
so
if
the
court
should
rule
against
me
on
point
one
then
i
would
contend
that
it
violates
the
due
process.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor.
as
far
as
the
trial
of
this
case,
either
way,
if
either
point
is
correct,
i
believe
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
because
there
was
no
lesser
included
offense
instruction
given.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor
on
the
due
process
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor
and
as
i’ll
point
out
again
on
the
due
process
part,
the
government
cites
at
very
recent
case.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
my
basis
is
that
an
indian
person
being
united
states
citizen
is
treated
differently
that
they
have
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
my
view
your
honor
is
that,
that
if
this
court
agrees
with
me
on
point
one
and
said
that
there
is
jurisdiction
and
you
read
the
statute
this
original
act
of
1885,
saying
that
when
congress
wrote
that,
saying
that
indians
would
be
tried
in
the
same
manner
in
the
same
courts
in
effect
like
everyone
else,
if
you
agree
on
that
point,
we
may
not
ever
get
to
the
due
process
part
of
in
this
particular
case,
looking
at
this
particular
case.
it
may
come
up
later
but
the
court
could
not
decide
that
issue
and
still
reverse
and
remand
this
case.
now
on
the
due
process
part
your
honors
what
i’m
contending
is
that
this
is
a
racial
classification,
the
government
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
is
true
your
honor,
as
this
is
court
is
held
in
sansone
versus
united
states
they
talk
about
it
as
an
entitlement
and
the
federal
courts
have
always
or
for
sometime
ruled
that
it
is
there,
not
be
given.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
would
be
a
substitute,
your
honor.
on
a
due
process
part
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
say
that
there’s
been
a
violation
of
due
process
for
two
reasons.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
i
have
in
my
brief
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
because
it
is
a
racial
classification,
and
as
the
government
points
out
that
the
short
answer
to
my
contention
is
that
the
clause
of
section
3242
to
which
petitioner
points,
simply
provides
that
ordinary
trial
procedures
apply
in
indian
cases
is
exactly
what
we’re
contending
here.
rule
31
(c)
which
is
a
statute
it
says
that
all
persons
must
be
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
but
they
are
not
given
one
here.
now
the
government
points
out
and
we
would
say
that
the
due
process
part
of
this
is
more
akin
to
mclaughlin
versus
florida.
they
point
out
in
their
brief
at
page
23,
they
cite
the
recent
case
of
mcginnis
versus
royster,
which
was
decided
by
this
case
on
february
21,
1973.
they
cite
language
in
their
brief,
but
they
don’t
cite
the
start
of
the
next
paragraph
which
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
case.
“when
classifications
do
not
call
for
strict
judicial
certainty,
this
is
certainly
the
only
approach
consistent
with
proper
judicial
regards
for
the
judgment
of
legislative
branch.”
my
reading
of
this
is
that
this
court
did
not
deal
that
this
case,
the
facts
which
involved
good
time
under
paroles
and
pardons,
needed
strict
judicial
scrutiny.
all
of
the
cases
mclaughlin
versus
florida
and
the
rest
talk
about
racial
classifications
as
having
that
very
strict
judicial
scrutiny
and
so
the
cases
that
they
have
cited
here
are
not
on
point.
this
court
in
weber
versus
aetna
casualty,
decided
in
1972,
has
suggested
a
test,
as
a
suggestive
test
that
where
you
have
personal
rights
which
we’re
contending
that
the
right
to
a
lesser
include
offense
in
this
case
does
is
a
personal
right,
there’s
a
dual
inquiry.
what
legitimate
interest
does
the
classification
promote,
and
what
fundamental
personal
rights
might
the
classification
involve
or
endanger?
now
the
eighth
circuit
below
in
its
split
opinion
said
that
tribal
sovereignty
is
the
thing
that
must
be
protected,
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
time
that
this
tribe,
crow
creek
tribe
is
not
an
indian
reorganization
act
tribe.
it
operates
under
the
code
of
indian
offenses
which
is
found
in
cfr
11.1
and
following
is
to
my
knowledge
there
are
no
tribal
codes
at
all.
it’s
all
out
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
so
at
least
to
the
crow
creek
tribe
where
this
happened,
the
tribal
sovereignty
is
questionable
at
least
to
decide
this
case
on
that.
but
the
fundamental
personal
rights
that
are
endangered
of
francis
keeble
as
an
indian
person
compared
to
other
indian
citizens
tried
in
federal
court,
it
is
his
contention
that
he
need
not
carry
with
him
the
tribe
that
tried
as
an
individual
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
he
should
be
tried
as
individual
and
they
should
be
given
all
those
protections,
because
if
he
is
not
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
rule
31
(c)
is
violative
of
that
statutory
protection.
he
also,
as
o’connor
versus
new
jersey
pointed
out
in
page
21
of
our
brief,
he
losses
the
right
to
have
the
jury
decide
the
degree
of
crime
as
well
as
whether,
the
crime
itself
was
committed
and
this
to
me
involves
the
province
of
the
jury
that
the
jury
is
lost
one
element
of
deciding
and
they
are
the
judges
of
the
facts.
however,
they
are
ruled
by
just
those
instructions
given
to
them
by
the
court.
but
there’s
another
thing
it’s
probably
more
important,
and
i
found
this
in
the
trial
of
these
type
of
cases
as
the
petitioner
has
lost
the
fact
that
he
can
plea
bargain.
now
this
court
in
santobello
versus
new
york
said
that
this
is
an
essential
component
of
the
administration
of
justice.
now
he
can
certainly
plea
bargain
in
the
sense
of
how
many
years
and
things
like
that,
but
what
about
the
difference
between
a
greater
offense
and
a
lesser
offense.
this
does
not
come
in
to
play.
the
government
contends
that
this
is
a
fair
and
rational
classification
yet
three
weeks
ago
in
a
case
that
i
tried,
there
were
two
major
crimes
committed,
larceny
and
burglary,
because
larceny
is
one
of
the
original
seven
crimes
and
it
is
in
the
statute
he
got,
this
fellow
got
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
on
larceny,
but
he
didn’t
on
burglary
because
they
said
there’s
no
jurisdiction.
now
here’s
two
felonies
same
occurrence
on,
one
point
he
gets
a
lesser
included
offense
instructions
for
which
he
was
convicted
and
on
the
other
one
he
doesn’t,
he
doesn’t
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
the
government
would
argue
that
the
united
states
of
america
never
intended
for
him
to
get
one,
yet
they’ve
been
careful
when
they
passed
the
act
back
in
1885
to
add
that
indian
persons
were
to
be
tried
in
the
same
manner
as
all
other
persons.
now,
the
government
further
contends
that
this
being
a
fair
and
rational
classification
is
that
only
in
effect
12
crimes
that
an
indian
maybe
charged
with
and
should
not
get
lesser
included
offense
instructions.
as
i
pointed
out
the
assimilative
crime
act,
which
is
in
effect
the
state
law
applied
through
the
federal
government,
those
apply
on
an
indian
reservation
unless
those
three
things
as
i’ve
mentioned
18
u.s.c.
52
excludes
which
is
indian
against
indian
which
is
if
he
is
been
punished
by
the
local
law,
the
tribe
and
if
there
is
a
specific
treaty
regulation
on
this.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
was
indian
against
indian.
the
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
the
wording
in
18
u.s.c.
1153,
mr.
justice
is,
they
have
changed
it
and
it
is
indian
or
any
other
person.
so
if
it
would’ve
been
a
white
man,
if
the
petitioner
would’ve
been
white,
every
other
fact
the
same,
he
would’ve
got
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
right.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
number
one
applying
the
facts
to
this
case,
there
is
a
case
on
this
where
the
crime
that
they
speak
of
is
discussed.
it’s
walks
on
top
versus
the
united
states
which
is
372
f.2d
422.
in
that
case,
the
man
assaulted
was
an
indian
either
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
special
officer
or
something,
he
was
an
indian
who
was
also
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
he
was
assaulted.
he
was
charged
under
the
general
law,
the
indian
who
assaulted
the
police
officer,
was
charged
under
the
general
laws
of
the
united
states,
assault
upon
a
federal
officer.
he
was
also
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
by
the
way,
but
the
point
out
what
they’re
getting
at
is
the
federal
connection,
i
assume.
now,
they’re
saying
that
number
one,
there
would
be
no
lesser
included
offense.
number
one
we
have
to
assume
and
they
don’t
make
this
clear
there
wasn’t
on
an
indian
reservation
or
of
course
their
example
is
given
is
incorrect
because
then
the
assimilative
crimes
act
would
apply,
but
there
the
connection
is
this,
the
federal
connection
is
that
he’s
a
federal
officer.
in
our
case,
the
federal
connection
is
that
its
territorial,
it’s
on
land
and
that
is
the
connection.
so
the
examples
that
they
give
is
that
it
is
not
always
in
all
or
nothing
situation.
the
federal
jurisdiction
here
we
have
to
assume
for
their
example,
although
they
don’t
make
it
clear
it’s
off
of
reservation.
otherwise,
he
would
be
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
under
this
very
factual
situation
that
he
talks
about
now.
and
on
the
bank
robbers
which
is
the
other
example
that
they
put
in
their
brief,
again
we’re
assuming
and
they
don’t
make
this
clear
that
it’s
not
in
on
an
indian
reservation,
all
we’re
saying
is
that
all
bank
robbers
are
treated
the
same
and
my
case
involves
a
situation
where
an
indian
isn’t
treated
equally
as
all
other
persons.
if
this
were
any
non-indian,
he
would’ve
been
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
in
our
factual
situation,
in
the
case
as
bank
robbery,
all
bank
robberies
are
treated
equally
and
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
for
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
then
all
persons,
no
matter
what
race,
they
are
treated
equally.
and
we
must
remember,
i
think
that
francis
keeble
is
an
indian
has
no
choice,
celestine
versus
the
united
states
decided
that
which
is
decided
as
i
recall
on
the
last
page
of
my
brief.
at
birth
he
can’t
make
an
election.
he
can’t
say
“i
now
wish
to
be
tried
as
a
white
man
and
be
a
white
man.”
there
are
two
cases,
one
says
the
white
man
born
white
can
never
be
indian,
and
an
indian
person
of
indian
decent
can
never
be
treated
as
a
white
man
under
these
acts,
so
that
there
is
no
choice
left
open.
he
is
treated
on
equally.
he
is
not
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
could’ve
been
you
honor.
i
think
the
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
this
is
where
the
government
starts
arguing
in
their
brief
along
that
line
that
there’s
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
in
this
particular
case,
i
don’t
know
your
honor,
because
i
cannot
tell
what
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no
i’m
saying
it’s
unconstitutional
no
matter
what
would’ve
happened,
but
i’m
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
i
don’t
think
that
it
would’ve
been
to
his
benefit
or
to
his
detriment
not
to
have
it.
all
i’m
saying
is
i
think
it
violates
the
united
states
constitution
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--
to
treat
him
differently.
we
all
know
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
within
the
purview
of
me
as
an
advocate
to
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
say
that
the
whole
scheme
could
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well
perhaps
it
is.
i’m
saying
that
well
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
maybe
12,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
if
you
did
not
have
this
statute?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
in
this
particular
case
you
would
bounce
from
one
federal
jurisdiction
into
or
one
federal
court
into
another,
because
we
have
a
cfr
court,
which
is
the
judges
are
federal
government
employee,
the
police
officer
is
federal
government
employee,
the
jail
is
federal
government,
the
food
they
feed
the
prisoners
is
federal
government.
the
only
way
you
can
put
an
indian
in
jail
in
the
crow
creek
indian
reservation
is
if
the
federal
government
decides
to
do
in
effect
because
all
the
arms
that
are
there
are
the
federal
government's.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
attempted
assault
would
not
be
covered
by
the
major
crimes
act
and
would
therefore
be
a
tribal
crime.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
code
of
federal
regulations
which
is
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well
it’s
a
dubious
court
to
say
the
least.
it’s
by
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
this
is
a
tribal
court
in
this
factual
situation.
now
sometimes,
this
doesn’t
apply
and
this
is
where
it’s
confusing
in
the
government’s
brief.
this
is
a
non-indian
reorganization
act
tribe.
it
hasn’t
assumed
the
lot
of
the
element
to
self
government.
this
particular
tribe
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
appendix
of
page
3,
4,
15
is
not
ira,
non-indian
reorganization
act.
the
people
on
that
reservation
voted
against
it.
they
decide
not
to
have
it.
therefore,
the
court
is
not
the
crow
creek
tribal
court.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it’s
a
cfr,
a
court
for
a
code
of
indian
offenses
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
the
government
says
this
is
a
fair
and
effective
administration
of
justice.
this
is
what
i’m
questioning,
i
don’t
agree.
one
thing
i
want
to
point
out
too
in
this
case
is
if
you
read
the
facts
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
and
you’ve
also
got
situations
in
states
where
there
is
state
jurisdiction
as
well,
there’s
a
number
of
them.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
is
mr.
justice,
it’s
a
court
of
indian
offenses,
a
federally
subsidized
court.
the
tribal
council
or
the
legislative
body
of
the
tribe
has
passed
to
my
knowledge
no
laws.
they
use
what
the
secretary
of
interior
prescribes
their
laws
to
be.
if
you’ll
note
in
the
facts
of
this
case
our
man
was
brought
in
by
a
federal
special
agent.
he
was
charged
with
section
11.49
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
for
disturbing
the
peace,
and
as
placed
and
there
was
a
remand
on
this,
this
was
another
part
of
the
case.
he
was
placed
in
jail
on
this
federal
misdemeanor
charge
until
the
fbi
man
could
come
out
from
sioux
falls
200
miles
away
to
investigate
the
felony
charges.
so
what
we
have
and
then
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
they
could,
if
they
so
wish
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
this
is
to
fill
the
void
until
a
tribe
decides
it
wants
its
own
laws
or
its
own
code
and
it
varies.
in
south
dakota
there
are
a
number
of
indian
reservations.
i
happen
to
live
on
rosebud.
it
is
an
indian
reorganization
act
tribe.
we
deal
in
that
tribal
court
with
laws
passed
by
the
rosebud
sioux
tribal
council.
and
so
therefore,
it
--
what
the
coding
system
is,
we
do
not
refer
to
this,
but
on
crow
creek
you
do
because
they
have
not
adopted
these
laws.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
the
judges
are
most
commonly
lay
persons
hired
by
the
department
of
interior.
once
in
a
while
if
the
tribe
is
large
and
the
case
load
is
large,
a
professional
attorney
will
be
hired,
but
usually
a
layman.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
in
some
areas
not
a
great
deal,
you
honor.
what
we’re
saying
is
another
factor
that
involves
here
is
forcing
an
indian
to
be
bounce
back
and
forth
which
i
know
this
court’s
held
as
between
federal
state
as
one
thing,
but
here
where
we’ve
got
a
code
of
federal
regulations
tribe,
what
the
government
wants
us
to
do
is
go
to
deadwood,
south
dakota
280
miles,
try
the
felony
and
then
if
there’s
an
acquittal,
come
back
and
face
the
tribal
charge,
whereas
a
non-indian
person
no
matter
what
his
race
could
take
care
of
all
of
it
at
once.
he
could
be
given
the
lesser
included
offense,
one
day
he’ll
have
his
justice
no
matter
what
it
be
and
an
indian
defendant
is
again
subjected
as
the
government
calls
it
a
fair
and
rational
classification
of
being
bounced
around
like
a
tennis
ball.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
i
recognize
that.
no,
i
don’t
recognize
that.
would
say
an
indian
would
not?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no
except
on
certain
sanitary
regulations
which
is
been
--
which
the
united
states
government
has
given
the
jurisdiction
to
the
state
for
certain
things
like
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
this
state
is
south
pierre,
south
dakota,
approximately
60
miles.
it’s
in
the
lower
brule
reservation
on
either
side
of
the
area
which
the
federal
government
built
a
dam
on
there.
reservation
is
such
been
diminished
it
is
right
by
which
known
as
the
big
bend
dam
on
the
missouri
river.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
east
of
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it’s
in
western
south
dakota
as
well.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no.
through
the
celestine
case,
an
indian
is
an
indian
no
matter
what
reservation
he’s
on.
if
you
try,
if
you
committed
one
of
the
13
major
crimes
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
pardon
me?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
all
indians,
all
indians
no
matter
where.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
you
would
be
tried
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act
because
you’re
non-indian.
he
would
be
tried
under
18
u.s.c.
1153.
you
would
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
he
would
not.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no
sir.
thank
you,
i
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
your
honor,
it’s
unfortunate
that
the
petitioner’s
taken
the
case
this
far
and
the
united
states
government
has
still
not
gotten
all
of
its
forces
together
and
decided
between
what’s
going
on
in
washington
and
what’s
going
on
in
south
dakota.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
tribal
indian.
if
a
man
of
indian
descent
is
born
and
raised
in
washington,
d.c.
at
age
28,
goes
on
a
vacation
to
the
black
hills,
passes
through
the
reservation,
commits
one
of
the
13
major
crimes,
he
will
not
be
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
that
well,
when
the
12
major
crime
because
if
he
steals
something,
and
its
larceny,
he
will.
now,
that’s
a
rational
classification
according
to
the
government.
the
government
says,
“don’t
anyone
step
in
here
because
this
has
all
been
thought
out”
yet
the
particular
crime
might
have
got
up
here,
congress
forget
to
even
amend
3242
which
they
did
the
other
12
times.
i
submit
that
congress
has
gone
at
this
since
1885
at
a
happenstance
manner.
they
have
never
once,
as
this
court
knows
had
this
issue
brought
to
them.
they
have
added
crime
one
at
a
time,
but
they’ve
never
considered
this
is
a
whole.
now
another
thing
that
the
government
brings
up
is
that
let’s
be
strict
about
this.
the
fact
and
i
will
say
that
i
did
not
raise
the
issue
about
the
discrepancy
of
the
statutory
language
in
the
major
crimes
act
and
what
he
was
charged
with
the
indictment.
i
did
not
raise
that.
and
at
this
point,
i
don’t
think
i
can
properly
do
so,
but
i’ll
tell
you
why
the
government
uses
that
statute.
south
dakota
has
a
statute
in
the
assault
section
about
four
after
this
one,
that
is
almost
exactly
like
the
federal
one,
it’s
called
beating
assault
by
beating,
wounding
and
kicking.
the
reason
they
don’t
use
it
is
it's
got
a
six
month
penalty
and
they
want
five
years,
and
that’s
why
they
don’t
use
it.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
your
honor,
this
is
the
first
trial
i
ever
had
and
i
didn’t
see
it.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
could
be
your
honor.
as
he
says
this
is
just
a
passing
thing.
i’ve
had
nine
cases
like
this
in
two
and
a
half
years
and
it
is
very
well
raised
in
all
the
rest
including
a
number
of
the
issues
that
they
say
that
are
speculative
gain,
say
and
everything
else
that
they
talk
about
in
the
last
part
of
their
brief,
which
i’m
not
saying
applies.
this
man
is
an
american
citizen.
he
has
been
since
1924.
the
federal
government
is
trying
him
for
a
crime.
he
should
be
tried
as
any
other
man
if
rule
31
(c)
says
that
a
man
should
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
this
court
seems
to
say
he
does,
then
this
indian
should
as
well.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
there’s
a
number
of
them.
attempted
man
slaughter
in
the
federal
law
six
months,
assault
by
wounding
and
kicking
i
think
118
(d)
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--
six
months.
there’s
a
number
of
them
your
honor
that
be
brought
in
under
the
assault—
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
also
point
out
that
i
have
argued
that,
that
the
cases
that
the
government
have
cited
since
then
by
district
courts
in
our
district,
have
used
those.
additionally
the
fact
that
i
could
ask
a
separate
sovereign,
that
i
can
ask
for
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
would
say
in
effect,
“if
you
don’t
convict
him,
he
can
go
back
to
tribal
court.”
the
district
judges
in
our
district
of
south
dakota
have
said,
“that’s
no
different
than
a
prosecutor
arguing
to
the
jury
convict
this
man
and
i’ll
recommend
that
he
get
parole.”
the
both
judges
consider
that
to
be
improper
argument.
i
as
an
attorney
think
that
is
improper
argument.
it’s
no
different
than
me
arguing
a
jury
in
state
court
saying,
“alright,
if
in
south
dakota,
acquitting
here
because
he
faced
more
serious
charges
in
nebraska,
i
don’t
think
that’s
proper.”
the
jury
argued
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
chief
judge
nickel
from
sioux
falls,
south
dakota,
your
honor.
and
on
this
matter,
his
view
was
that
it
was
strictly
jurisdictional.
in
our
circuit,
i
don’t
know
if
it’s
proper
to
express
this,
but
i’m
sure
and
the
government
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
their
briefs
says
“don’t
give
us
his
power
because
we
may
abuse
it.”
but
the
petitioner
and
defense
lawyers
in
our
state
wish
very
much
that
they
have
it,
because
this
gives
us
more
latitude.
it
feel
--
we
feel
now
that
many
cases
you
have
to
take
the
trial.
you
plea
the
man
of
a
felony
that
you
don’t
feel
convicted
of,
and
by
the
way
the
grand
jury
of
course
is
the
buffer.
and
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
man
was
originally
charged
with
manslaughter
because
i
didn’t
know
to
do,
i
demanded
a
preliminary
hearing
and
got
one
surprisingly.
he
was
bound
over
on
manslaughter.
later
they
took
it
to
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
returned
an
assault
with
intent
and
so
forth
to
do
great
bodily
injury.
so
there
is
a
buffer
there.
there’s
no
danger
in
my
opinion
if
the
grand
jury
system
works
and
a
defense
lawyer
doesn’t
know
what
goes
on
that
there’ll
be
this
thing
of
the
prosecutor
doubling
up,
charging
a
greater
crime
hoping
to
get
a
conviction
on
the
minor
because
most
misdemeanors
are,
you
know,
a
six-month
variety
and
the
tribal
court
has
that
jurisdiction,
or
cfr
does
in
this
case.
your
honor,
we
would
ask
the
petitioner's
request
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
be
issued
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
your
honor,
i
also
thank
you
for
letting
me
appear
since
i
don’t
qualify
as
a
member
of
the
supreme
court
bar.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
supreme
court
from
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
issued
a
split
decision,
affirming
judge
neckel
of
the
district
of
south
dakota.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
basically
that
this
crime
was
committed
upon
an
indian
reservation
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
the
crow
creek
indian
reservation,
by
one
indian
against
another
indian.
the
indictment
was
brought
under
18
u.s.c.
1153.
there
was
a
conviction
had
on
this
crime.
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
defense
requested
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
that
was
not
given
and
the
supreme
court
on
december
4th
of
year
past,
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court’s
refusal
to
give
that
lesser
included
defense
instruction
under
18
u.s.c.
1153
violated
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
guarantee.
now
the
lesser
included
defense
instruction
that
was
requested
was
the
crime
of
assault
to
the
major
crime
of
assault
with
intent
to
do
a
great
bodily
injury.
the
defendant
in
this
case
has
two
basic
contentions.
number
one,
that
the
act
of
1885
intended
that
indians
be
tried
in
the
same
manner
and
in
the
same
courts
as
other
persons
committing
the
same
crimes
and
the
second
is,
that
if
the
petitioner’s
contention
that
this
is
incorrect
and
congress
did
not
intend
the
jurisdiction
be
present
to
convict
under
lesser
included
offense
instructions,
then
18
u.s.c.
as
applied,
violates
due
process
because
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
is
part
of
the
fundamentally
fair
trial
and
rule
31
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
so
direct.
before
i
launch
into
the
main
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
correction
as
i
see
it
in
the
government’s
brief
and
that
is
argument
2,
pages
19
to
23,
and
the
petitioner’s
view
of
that
is
not
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
present
time.
they
speak
in
their
brief
of
a
narrow
class
of
cases
which
would
lead
me
to
believe
they
think
is
13
major
crimes.
this
is
not
the
state
of
the
law
in
indian
reservations
in
the
united
states.
the
general
laws
of
the
united
states
apply
except
and
18
u.s.c.
1152
points
this
out,
“if
the
crime
is
one
indian
against
another
indian,
if
there
has
been
punishment
under
tribal
law
and
number
three,
if
the
treaty
rights
control
this
particular
point
and
a
case
cited
in
the
government’s
brief
points
this
out
which
is
the
menominee
tribe
versus
united
states
which
is
a
fishing
right
under
treaty
and
which
continues.
now
an
example
of
this
is
a
case
which
is
not
cited
in
any
brief,
united
states
versus
berlin,
441
f.2d
1199
and
this
court
denied
cert
in
that
case.
that
was
forgery
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here
when
i
am
talking
about
the
general
laws
in
the
united
states
is
that
the
assimilative
crimes
act
applies
to
indians.
that
case
so
held
that,
involved
the
conviction
out
of
montana
for
forgery
under
the
state
statute.
an
example
of
this
right
now
is
the
occurrences
which
are
in
news,
the
wounded
knee.
i
have
read
the
indictments
against
some
of
these
people.
it
is
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
it's
for
violations
of
postal
regulations,
involving
postal
things
which
the
wounded
knee
trading
post
is
also
a
post
office,
so
the
assimilated
crimes
act
does
apply.
now
the
important
thing
about
that
in
this
case
is
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
an
indian
would
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
only
when
you
are
talking
about
the
13
major
crimes,
does
he
not
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
and
as
the
government
talks
about
this
clear
pattern,
within
the
13
there
is
one
that
there
is
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
included
within
which
is
larceny
and
that
would
be
the
common
thing
of
petty
larceny,
larceny
under
$100.00
which
is
included
therein.
now
then
the
jurisdictional
part
as
the
court
is
aware,
started
with
crow
dog
which
is
in
1883
said
that
the
united
states
government
has
no
jurisdiction
over
crimes
by
one
indian
against
another
indian
on
an
indian
reservation.
out
of
that
decision
by
the
supreme
court,
the
act
of
march
3rd,
1885
set
up
the
jurisdictional
scheme
that
we
now
have
on
indian
reservations.
that
said
within
a
territory,
which
south
dakota
was
at
that
time,
within
a
territory
the
laws
of
the
territory
applied
to
all
persons,
indian
and
white
alike,
without
any
thought
of
an
indian
reservation.
therefore,
between
that
dates
1885
and
1889
in
the
territory
of
dakota,
an
indian
would
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
upon
south
dakota
becoming
a
state
in
1889,
indians
washed
this
right
because
the
second
part
of
the
act
of
1885
took
effect
which
said
that
within
a
state
if
it
happened
within
the
confines
of
an
indian
reservation
federal
law
applied,
which
of
that
kind
there
were
seven
major
crimes
defined
by
federal
law.
there
are
since
been
six
added
all
defined
by
state
law.
now
within
that
reservation
or
within
that
four-year
period,
an
indian
was
given
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
1889,
the
present
scheme
came
up
and
ever
since
then
all
the
courts
have
held
and
i’m
the
first
to
admit
that
the
case
law
and
the
petitioner's
side
is
minuscule.
no
court
has
allowed
without
being
reversed
lesser
included
offense
instructions.
however,
the
petitioner
would
point
out
that
on
page
10
of
our
brief
the
totality
of
two
statutes
now
re-codified
must
be
look
at.
they
are
18
u.s.c.
1153
and
18
u.s.c.
3242.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor.
close
reading,
in
fact
the
government
decided
the
case
united
states
versus
jacobs,
close
reading
of
that
case
reveals
that
it
was
the
government
in
that
case
that
wished
to
have
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
as
i
remember
it
was
rape
and
carnal
knowledge
or
something
of
that
matter,
but
they
have
in
the
past,
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
your
honor,
i
am
if,
the
first
point,
if
this
court
should
find
that
i
am
incorrect
and
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
give
a
lesser
included
offense
instructions
then
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
18
u.s.c.
1153
as
applied,
meaning
not
giving
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
it
violates
due
process.
so
if
the
court
should
rule
against
me
on
point
one
then
i
would
contend
that
it
violates
the
due
process.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor.
as
far
as
the
trial
of
this
case,
either
way,
if
either
point
is
correct,
i
believe
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
because
there
was
no
lesser
included
offense
instruction
given.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor
on
the
due
process
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor
and
as
i’ll
point
out
again
on
the
due
process
part,
the
government
cites
at
very
recent
case.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
my
basis
is
that
an
indian
person
being
united
states
citizen
is
treated
differently
that
they
have
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
my
view
your
honor
is
that,
that
if
this
court
agrees
with
me
on
point
one
and
said
that
there
is
jurisdiction
and
you
read
the
statute
this
original
act
of
1885,
saying
that
when
congress
wrote
that,
saying
that
indians
would
be
tried
in
the
same
manner
in
the
same
courts
in
effect
like
everyone
else,
if
you
agree
on
that
point,
we
may
not
ever
get
to
the
due
process
part
of
in
this
particular
case,
looking
at
this
particular
case.
it
may
come
up
later
but
the
court
could
not
decide
that
issue
and
still
reverse
and
remand
this
case.
now
on
the
due
process
part
your
honors
what
i’m
contending
is
that
this
is
a
racial
classification,
the
government
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
is
true
your
honor,
as
this
is
court
is
held
in
sansone
versus
united
states
they
talk
about
it
as
an
entitlement
and
the
federal
courts
have
always
or
for
sometime
ruled
that
it
is
there,
not
be
given.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
would
be
a
substitute,
your
honor.
on
a
due
process
part
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
say
that
there’s
been
a
violation
of
due
process
for
two
reasons.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
i
have
in
my
brief
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
because
it
is
a
racial
classification,
and
as
the
government
points
out
that
the
short
answer
to
my
contention
is
that
the
clause
of
section
3242
to
which
petitioner
points,
simply
provides
that
ordinary
trial
procedures
apply
in
indian
cases
is
exactly
what
we’re
contending
here.
rule
31
(c)
which
is
a
statute
it
says
that
all
persons
must
be
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
but
they
are
not
given
one
here.
now
the
government
points
out
and
we
would
say
that
the
due
process
part
of
this
is
more
akin
to
mclaughlin
versus
florida.
they
point
out
in
their
brief
at
page
23,
they
cite
the
recent
case
of
mcginnis
versus
royster,
which
was
decided
by
this
case
on
february
21,
1973.
they
cite
language
in
their
brief,
but
they
don’t
cite
the
start
of
the
next
paragraph
which
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
case.
“when
classifications
do
not
call
for
strict
judicial
certainty,
this
is
certainly
the
only
approach
consistent
with
proper
judicial
regards
for
the
judgment
of
legislative
branch.”
my
reading
of
this
is
that
this
court
did
not
deal
that
this
case,
the
facts
which
involved
good
time
under
paroles
and
pardons,
needed
strict
judicial
scrutiny.
all
of
the
cases
mclaughlin
versus
florida
and
the
rest
talk
about
racial
classifications
as
having
that
very
strict
judicial
scrutiny
and
so
the
cases
that
they
have
cited
here
are
not
on
point.
this
court
in
weber
versus
aetna
casualty,
decided
in
1972,
has
suggested
a
test,
as
a
suggestive
test
that
where
you
have
personal
rights
which
we’re
contending
that
the
right
to
a
lesser
include
offense
in
this
case
does
is
a
personal
right,
there’s
a
dual
inquiry.
what
legitimate
interest
does
the
classification
promote,
and
what
fundamental
personal
rights
might
the
classification
involve
or
endanger?
now
the
eighth
circuit
below
in
its
split
opinion
said
that
tribal
sovereignty
is
the
thing
that
must
be
protected,
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
time
that
this
tribe,
crow
creek
tribe
is
not
an
indian
reorganization
act
tribe.
it
operates
under
the
code
of
indian
offenses
which
is
found
in
cfr
11.1
and
following
is
to
my
knowledge
there
are
no
tribal
codes
at
all.
it’s
all
out
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
so
at
least
to
the
crow
creek
tribe
where
this
happened,
the
tribal
sovereignty
is
questionable
at
least
to
decide
this
case
on
that.
but
the
fundamental
personal
rights
that
are
endangered
of
francis
keeble
as
an
indian
person
compared
to
other
indian
citizens
tried
in
federal
court,
it
is
his
contention
that
he
need
not
carry
with
him
the
tribe
that
tried
as
an
individual
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
he
should
be
tried
as
individual
and
they
should
be
given
all
those
protections,
because
if
he
is
not
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
rule
31
(c)
is
violative
of
that
statutory
protection.
he
also,
as
o’connor
versus
new
jersey
pointed
out
in
page
21
of
our
brief,
he
losses
the
right
to
have
the
jury
decide
the
degree
of
crime
as
well
as
whether,
the
crime
itself
was
committed
and
this
to
me
involves
the
province
of
the
jury
that
the
jury
is
lost
one
element
of
deciding
and
they
are
the
judges
of
the
facts.
however,
they
are
ruled
by
just
those
instructions
given
to
them
by
the
court.
but
there’s
another
thing
it’s
probably
more
important,
and
i
found
this
in
the
trial
of
these
type
of
cases
as
the
petitioner
has
lost
the
fact
that
he
can
plea
bargain.
now
this
court
in
santobello
versus
new
york
said
that
this
is
an
essential
component
of
the
administration
of
justice.
now
he
can
certainly
plea
bargain
in
the
sense
of
how
many
years
and
things
like
that,
but
what
about
the
difference
between
a
greater
offense
and
a
lesser
offense.
this
does
not
come
in
to
play.
the
government
contends
that
this
is
a
fair
and
rational
classification
yet
three
weeks
ago
in
a
case
that
i
tried,
there
were
two
major
crimes
committed,
larceny
and
burglary,
because
larceny
is
one
of
the
original
seven
crimes
and
it
is
in
the
statute
he
got,
this
fellow
got
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
on
larceny,
but
he
didn’t
on
burglary
because
they
said
there’s
no
jurisdiction.
now
here’s
two
felonies
same
occurrence
on,
one
point
he
gets
a
lesser
included
offense
instructions
for
which
he
was
convicted
and
on
the
other
one
he
doesn’t,
he
doesn’t
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
the
government
would
argue
that
the
united
states
of
america
never
intended
for
him
to
get
one,
yet
they’ve
been
careful
when
they
passed
the
act
back
in
1885
to
add
that
indian
persons
were
to
be
tried
in
the
same
manner
as
all
other
persons.
now,
the
government
further
contends
that
this
being
a
fair
and
rational
classification
is
that
only
in
effect
12
crimes
that
an
indian
maybe
charged
with
and
should
not
get
lesser
included
offense
instructions.
as
i
pointed
out
the
assimilative
crime
act,
which
is
in
effect
the
state
law
applied
through
the
federal
government,
those
apply
on
an
indian
reservation
unless
those
three
things
as
i’ve
mentioned
18
u.s.c.
52
excludes
which
is
indian
against
indian
which
is
if
he
is
been
punished
by
the
local
law,
the
tribe
and
if
there
is
a
specific
treaty
regulation
on
this.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
was
indian
against
indian.
the
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
the
wording
in
18
u.s.c.
1153,
mr.
justice
is,
they
have
changed
it
and
it
is
indian
or
any
other
person.
so
if
it
would’ve
been
a
white
man,
if
the
petitioner
would’ve
been
white,
every
other
fact
the
same,
he
would’ve
got
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
right.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
number
one
applying
the
facts
to
this
case,
there
is
a
case
on
this
where
the
crime
that
they
speak
of
is
discussed.
it’s
walks
on
top
versus
the
united
states
which
is
372
f.2d
422.
in
that
case,
the
man
assaulted
was
an
indian
either
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
special
officer
or
something,
he
was
an
indian
who
was
also
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
he
was
assaulted.
he
was
charged
under
the
general
law,
the
indian
who
assaulted
the
police
officer,
was
charged
under
the
general
laws
of
the
united
states,
assault
upon
a
federal
officer.
he
was
also
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
by
the
way,
but
the
point
out
what
they’re
getting
at
is
the
federal
connection,
i
assume.
now,
they’re
saying
that
number
one,
there
would
be
no
lesser
included
offense.
number
one
we
have
to
assume
and
they
don’t
make
this
clear
there
wasn’t
on
an
indian
reservation
or
of
course
their
example
is
given
is
incorrect
because
then
the
assimilative
crimes
act
would
apply,
but
there
the
connection
is
this,
the
federal
connection
is
that
he’s
a
federal
officer.
in
our
case,
the
federal
connection
is
that
its
territorial,
it’s
on
land
and
that
is
the
connection.
so
the
examples
that
they
give
is
that
it
is
not
always
in
all
or
nothing
situation.
the
federal
jurisdiction
here
we
have
to
assume
for
their
example,
although
they
don’t
make
it
clear
it’s
off
of
reservation.
otherwise,
he
would
be
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
under
this
very
factual
situation
that
he
talks
about
now.
and
on
the
bank
robbers
which
is
the
other
example
that
they
put
in
their
brief,
again
we’re
assuming
and
they
don’t
make
this
clear
that
it’s
not
in
on
an
indian
reservation,
all
we’re
saying
is
that
all
bank
robbers
are
treated
the
same
and
my
case
involves
a
situation
where
an
indian
isn’t
treated
equally
as
all
other
persons.
if
this
were
any
non-indian,
he
would’ve
been
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
in
our
factual
situation,
in
the
case
as
bank
robbery,
all
bank
robberies
are
treated
equally
and
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
for
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
then
all
persons,
no
matter
what
race,
they
are
treated
equally.
and
we
must
remember,
i
think
that
francis
keeble
is
an
indian
has
no
choice,
celestine
versus
the
united
states
decided
that
which
is
decided
as
i
recall
on
the
last
page
of
my
brief.
at
birth
he
can’t
make
an
election.
he
can’t
say
“i
now
wish
to
be
tried
as
a
white
man
and
be
a
white
man.”
there
are
two
cases,
one
says
the
white
man
born
white
can
never
be
indian,
and
an
indian
person
of
indian
decent
can
never
be
treated
as
a
white
man
under
these
acts,
so
that
there
is
no
choice
left
open.
he
is
treated
on
equally.
he
is
not
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
could’ve
been
you
honor.
i
think
the
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
this
is
where
the
government
starts
arguing
in
their
brief
along
that
line
that
there’s
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
in
this
particular
case,
i
don’t
know
your
honor,
because
i
cannot
tell
what
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no
i’m
saying
it’s
unconstitutional
no
matter
what
would’ve
happened,
but
i’m
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
i
don’t
think
that
it
would’ve
been
to
his
benefit
or
to
his
detriment
not
to
have
it.
all
i’m
saying
is
i
think
it
violates
the
united
states
constitution
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--
to
treat
him
differently.
we
all
know
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
within
the
purview
of
me
as
an
advocate
to
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
say
that
the
whole
scheme
could
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well
perhaps
it
is.
i’m
saying
that
well
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
maybe
12,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
if
you
did
not
have
this
statute?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
in
this
particular
case
you
would
bounce
from
one
federal
jurisdiction
into
or
one
federal
court
into
another,
because
we
have
a
cfr
court,
which
is
the
judges
are
federal
government
employee,
the
police
officer
is
federal
government
employee,
the
jail
is
federal
government,
the
food
they
feed
the
prisoners
is
federal
government.
the
only
way
you
can
put
an
indian
in
jail
in
the
crow
creek
indian
reservation
is
if
the
federal
government
decides
to
do
in
effect
because
all
the
arms
that
are
there
are
the
federal
government's.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
attempted
assault
would
not
be
covered
by
the
major
crimes
act
and
would
therefore
be
a
tribal
crime.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
code
of
federal
regulations
which
is
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well
it’s
a
dubious
court
to
say
the
least.
it’s
by
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
this
is
a
tribal
court
in
this
factual
situation.
now
sometimes,
this
doesn’t
apply
and
this
is
where
it’s
confusing
in
the
government’s
brief.
this
is
a
non-indian
reorganization
act
tribe.
it
hasn’t
assumed
the
lot
of
the
element
to
self
government.
this
particular
tribe
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
appendix
of
page
3,
4,
15
is
not
ira,
non-indian
reorganization
act.
the
people
on
that
reservation
voted
against
it.
they
decide
not
to
have
it.
therefore,
the
court
is
not
the
crow
creek
tribal
court.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it’s
a
cfr,
a
court
for
a
code
of
indian
offenses
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
the
government
says
this
is
a
fair
and
effective
administration
of
justice.
this
is
what
i’m
questioning,
i
don’t
agree.
one
thing
i
want
to
point
out
too
in
this
case
is
if
you
read
the
facts
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
and
you’ve
also
got
situations
in
states
where
there
is
state
jurisdiction
as
well,
there’s
a
number
of
them.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
is
mr.
justice,
it’s
a
court
of
indian
offenses,
a
federally
subsidized
court.
the
tribal
council
or
the
legislative
body
of
the
tribe
has
passed
to
my
knowledge
no
laws.
they
use
what
the
secretary
of
interior
prescribes
their
laws
to
be.
if
you’ll
note
in
the
facts
of
this
case
our
man
was
brought
in
by
a
federal
special
agent.
he
was
charged
with
section
11.49
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
for
disturbing
the
peace,
and
as
placed
and
there
was
a
remand
on
this,
this
was
another
part
of
the
case.
he
was
placed
in
jail
on
this
federal
misdemeanor
charge
until
the
fbi
man
could
come
out
from
sioux
falls
200
miles
away
to
investigate
the
felony
charges.
so
what
we
have
and
then
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
they
could,
if
they
so
wish
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
this
is
to
fill
the
void
until
a
tribe
decides
it
wants
its
own
laws
or
its
own
code
and
it
varies.
in
south
dakota
there
are
a
number
of
indian
reservations.
i
happen
to
live
on
rosebud.
it
is
an
indian
reorganization
act
tribe.
we
deal
in
that
tribal
court
with
laws
passed
by
the
rosebud
sioux
tribal
council.
and
so
therefore,
it
--
what
the
coding
system
is,
we
do
not
refer
to
this,
but
on
crow
creek
you
do
because
they
have
not
adopted
these
laws.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
the
judges
are
most
commonly
lay
persons
hired
by
the
department
of
interior.
once
in
a
while
if
the
tribe
is
large
and
the
case
load
is
large,
a
professional
attorney
will
be
hired,
but
usually
a
layman.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
in
some
areas
not
a
great
deal,
you
honor.
what
we’re
saying
is
another
factor
that
involves
here
is
forcing
an
indian
to
be
bounce
back
and
forth
which
i
know
this
court’s
held
as
between
federal
state
as
one
thing,
but
here
where
we’ve
got
a
code
of
federal
regulations
tribe,
what
the
government
wants
us
to
do
is
go
to
deadwood,
south
dakota
280
miles,
try
the
felony
and
then
if
there’s
an
acquittal,
come
back
and
face
the
tribal
charge,
whereas
a
non-indian
person
no
matter
what
his
race
could
take
care
of
all
of
it
at
once.
he
could
be
given
the
lesser
included
offense,
one
day
he’ll
have
his
justice
no
matter
what
it
be
and
an
indian
defendant
is
again
subjected
as
the
government
calls
it
a
fair
and
rational
classification
of
being
bounced
around
like
a
tennis
ball.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
i
recognize
that.
no,
i
don’t
recognize
that.
would
say
an
indian
would
not?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no
except
on
certain
sanitary
regulations
which
is
been
--
which
the
united
states
government
has
given
the
jurisdiction
to
the
state
for
certain
things
like
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
this
state
is
south
pierre,
south
dakota,
approximately
60
miles.
it’s
in
the
lower
brule
reservation
on
either
side
of
the
area
which
the
federal
government
built
a
dam
on
there.
reservation
is
such
been
diminished
it
is
right
by
which
known
as
the
big
bend
dam
on
the
missouri
river.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
east
of
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it’s
in
western
south
dakota
as
well.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no.
through
the
celestine
case,
an
indian
is
an
indian
no
matter
what
reservation
he’s
on.
if
you
try,
if
you
committed
one
of
the
13
major
crimes
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
pardon
me?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
all
indians,
all
indians
no
matter
where.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
you
would
be
tried
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act
because
you’re
non-indian.
he
would
be
tried
under
18
u.s.c.
1153.
you
would
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
he
would
not.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no
sir.
thank
you,
i
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
your
honor,
it’s
unfortunate
that
the
petitioner’s
taken
the
case
this
far
and
the
united
states
government
has
still
not
gotten
all
of
its
forces
together
and
decided
between
what’s
going
on
in
washington
and
what’s
going
on
in
south
dakota.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
tribal
indian.
if
a
man
of
indian
descent
is
born
and
raised
in
washington,
d.c.
at
age
28,
goes
on
a
vacation
to
the
black
hills,
passes
through
the
reservation,
commits
one
of
the
13
major
crimes,
he
will
not
be
given
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
that
well,
when
the
12
major
crime
because
if
he
steals
something,
and
its
larceny,
he
will.
now,
that’s
a
rational
classification
according
to
the
government.
the
government
says,
“don’t
anyone
step
in
here
because
this
has
all
been
thought
out”
yet
the
particular
crime
might
have
got
up
here,
congress
forget
to
even
amend
3242
which
they
did
the
other
12
times.
i
submit
that
congress
has
gone
at
this
since
1885
at
a
happenstance
manner.
they
have
never
once,
as
this
court
knows
had
this
issue
brought
to
them.
they
have
added
crime
one
at
a
time,
but
they’ve
never
considered
this
is
a
whole.
now
another
thing
that
the
government
brings
up
is
that
let’s
be
strict
about
this.
the
fact
and
i
will
say
that
i
did
not
raise
the
issue
about
the
discrepancy
of
the
statutory
language
in
the
major
crimes
act
and
what
he
was
charged
with
the
indictment.
i
did
not
raise
that.
and
at
this
point,
i
don’t
think
i
can
properly
do
so,
but
i’ll
tell
you
why
the
government
uses
that
statute.
south
dakota
has
a
statute
in
the
assault
section
about
four
after
this
one,
that
is
almost
exactly
like
the
federal
one,
it’s
called
beating
assault
by
beating,
wounding
and
kicking.
the
reason
they
don’t
use
it
is
it's
got
a
six
month
penalty
and
they
want
five
years,
and
that’s
why
they
don’t
use
it.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
your
honor,
this
is
the
first
trial
i
ever
had
and
i
didn’t
see
it.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
could
be
your
honor.
as
he
says
this
is
just
a
passing
thing.
i’ve
had
nine
cases
like
this
in
two
and
a
half
years
and
it
is
very
well
raised
in
all
the
rest
including
a
number
of
the
issues
that
they
say
that
are
speculative
gain,
say
and
everything
else
that
they
talk
about
in
the
last
part
of
their
brief,
which
i’m
not
saying
applies.
this
man
is
an
american
citizen.
he
has
been
since
1924.
the
federal
government
is
trying
him
for
a
crime.
he
should
be
tried
as
any
other
man
if
rule
31
(c)
says
that
a
man
should
get
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
this
court
seems
to
say
he
does,
then
this
indian
should
as
well.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
there’s
a
number
of
them.
attempted
man
slaughter
in
the
federal
law
six
months,
assault
by
wounding
and
kicking
i
think
118
(d)
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--
six
months.
there’s
a
number
of
them
your
honor
that
be
brought
in
under
the
assault—
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
also
point
out
that
i
have
argued
that,
that
the
cases
that
the
government
have
cited
since
then
by
district
courts
in
our
district,
have
used
those.
additionally
the
fact
that
i
could
ask
a
separate
sovereign,
that
i
can
ask
for
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
would
say
in
effect,
“if
you
don’t
convict
him,
he
can
go
back
to
tribal
court.”
the
district
judges
in
our
district
of
south
dakota
have
said,
“that’s
no
different
than
a
prosecutor
arguing
to
the
jury
convict
this
man
and
i’ll
recommend
that
he
get
parole.”
the
both
judges
consider
that
to
be
improper
argument.
i
as
an
attorney
think
that
is
improper
argument.
it’s
no
different
than
me
arguing
a
jury
in
state
court
saying,
“alright,
if
in
south
dakota,
acquitting
here
because
he
faced
more
serious
charges
in
nebraska,
i
don’t
think
that’s
proper.”
the
jury
argued
--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
chief
judge
nickel
from
sioux
falls,
south
dakota,
your
honor.
and
on
this
matter,
his
view
was
that
it
was
strictly
jurisdictional.
in
our
circuit,
i
don’t
know
if
it’s
proper
to
express
this,
but
i’m
sure
and
the
government
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
their
briefs
says
“don’t
give
us
his
power
because
we
may
abuse
it.”
but
the
petitioner
and
defense
lawyers
in
our
state
wish
very
much
that
they
have
it,
because
this
gives
us
more
latitude.
it
feel
--
we
feel
now
that
many
cases
you
have
to
take
the
trial.
you
plea
the
man
of
a
felony
that
you
don’t
feel
convicted
of,
and
by
the
way
the
grand
jury
of
course
is
the
buffer.
and
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
man
was
originally
charged
with
manslaughter
because
i
didn’t
know
to
do,
i
demanded
a
preliminary
hearing
and
got
one
surprisingly.
he
was
bound
over
on
manslaughter.
later
they
took
it
to
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
returned
an
assault
with
intent
and
so
forth
to
do
great
bodily
injury.
so
there
is
a
buffer
there.
there’s
no
danger
in
my
opinion
if
the
grand
jury
system
works
and
a
defense
lawyer
doesn’t
know
what
goes
on
that
there’ll
be
this
thing
of
the
prosecutor
doubling
up,
charging
a
greater
crime
hoping
to
get
a
conviction
on
the
minor
because
most
misdemeanors
are,
you
know,
a
six-month
variety
and
the
tribal
court
has
that
