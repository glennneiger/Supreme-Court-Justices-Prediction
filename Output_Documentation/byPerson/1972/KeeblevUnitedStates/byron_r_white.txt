but
isn’t
it
what
could
be
a
violation
for
due
process
only
because
it
denies
something
in
the
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
otherwise
it’s
not
--
it's
just
kind
of
treat
some
people
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
it
is,
would
that
be
the
basis
for
your
due
process
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
federal
equal
protection
and
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
there’s
two
ways
of
hearing
it,
isn’t
there?
one
way
is
to
have
saying
that
the
lesser
included
defense
instructions
available
in
this
case,
the
other
way
that
this
is
available
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
an
equal
protection,
that's
a
substitute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
arguably
in
his
advantage?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
only
a
hindsight,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
because
you
don’t
know
it’s
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
treat
him
differently,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
could
say
i
suppose
that
this
whole
scheme
of
things
splitting
up
whatever
the
13
crimes
that
all
are
appropriate
(inaudible),
is
unconstitutional,
because
it
does
treat
indians
different
from
others.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
a
fortiori
it
would
be
at
this
stage?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
this
be
the
tribal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
a
cfr
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
like
a
treble
denial
-–
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
got
reorganization
act
indian,
you
got
cfr
indians
-–
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
are
to
just
point
at
the
indians
(inaudible)
major
crimes
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
tried
for
assaulting
with
intent,
that’s
what
he
was
charged
with,
that
was
he
was
tried
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
really?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
that
when
he
was
indicted
for
something
clearly
not
within
the
reach
of
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
don’t
you
think
we
have
to
decide
whether
this
crime
is
within
the
framework
of
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
we
put
it
aside
maybe
for
some
other
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
instruction
say?
was
it
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
instruction
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
the
government
had
only
to
prove
really
to
bring
itself
within
the
statute
an
assault
and
resulting
bodily
harm
and
that
in
fact
you
showed
that
the
burden
of
proving
intent
to
inflict
and
therefore
he
got
a
better
break
than
he
was
entitled
to
on
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
is
one
element
at
the
time
was
never
submitted
in
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judge
explained
to
the
jury
that
he
wasn’t
charged
with
beating
him
to
death
or
even
cause
him
serious?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
contention
there
is
no
intention
and
no
contest
by
the
government
that
the
beating
in
question
is
ultimate
death
of
the
victim.
in
fact,
there
is
no
medical
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
death
was
(inaudible).
but
then
it
is
not
charged
as
beating
but
only
with
beatings
of
death
was
intent,
charged
only
with
intent
to
beat
or
to
beat
with
intent
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that
this
isn’t
--
it
is
may
not
--
you
may
have
been
tried
for
a
crime
that
you
had
no
authority
to
charge,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
that,
what
would
then
the
penalty
on
the
lesser
included
offense?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
six
months.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
instruction
you
asked
was
to
be
instructed
on
a
crime
that
really
wasn’t
the
only
crime
that
should
have
been
tried
under
the
major
crimes
act,
you’re
making
this

you
really
are
making
the

argument
on

lesser

offense
as
you
would
have
been
if
you
said
dismiss
the
indictment.
it
doesn’t
charge
the
right
crime?

isn’t
it
what
