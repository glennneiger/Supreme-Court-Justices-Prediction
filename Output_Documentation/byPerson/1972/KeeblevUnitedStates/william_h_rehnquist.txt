mr.
meierhenry,
let
me
go
back
just
a
minute
in
your
argument.
you
say
that
no
court
ever
allowed
it
without
being
reversed.
does
the
government
occasionally
asked
for
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
as
well
as
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don’t
claim
any
infirmity
in
the
statute
other
than
if
it
is
construed
to
preclude
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
non-indian
would
be
subject
in
some
circumstances
to
trial
in
federal
court
in
one
city
and
state
court
in
another
city
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction
which
an
indian
wouldn’t?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
--
which
an
indian
in
this
particular
tribe
situation
would
not
be
as
i
understand
it.
are
any
of
the
indians
on
the
crow
reservation
subject
to
state
criminal
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
it
because
it’s
a
limited
grant
of
certiorari?
