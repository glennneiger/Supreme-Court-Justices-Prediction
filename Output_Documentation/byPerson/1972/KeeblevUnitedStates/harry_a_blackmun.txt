a.
blackmun
mr.
meierhenry,
you
are
not
attacking
the
statute
on
constitutional
grounds,
are
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
wonder
why
you
don’t
attack
it
constitutionally
head
on.
wouldn’t
your
client
be
better
off
if
you
could
knock
the
statute
out?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
meierhenry,
in
the
government’s
brief
reference
is
made
to
the
federal
statute
having
to
do
with
assault
upon
a
federal
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
duties,
18
u.s.c.
111
and
the
suggestion
is
that
this
is
comparable
and
that
there
no
lesser
included
offense
for
simple
assault
is
available
to
the
defendant.
do
you
have
any
comment
about
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
meierhenry,
who
was
the
trial
judge
here,
