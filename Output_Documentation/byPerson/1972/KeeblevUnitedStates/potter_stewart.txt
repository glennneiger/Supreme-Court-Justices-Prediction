justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
case
which
one
of
those
three
was
it,
indian
against
indian?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
the
only
reason
in
this
case,
that
this
case
was
under
the
assimilative
crime
act
that
you’re
telling
us?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
because
he
wouldn't
--
here
this
1153
applies
only
to
an
indian
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
when
the
man
charged
is
an
indian?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
could
also
argue
if
you
didn’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
didn’t
have
this
statute
you’d
be
treating
indians
differently
because
they’d
be
tried
in
tribal
courts
and
other
people
would
be
tried
in
the
united
states
district
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
so
it’s
unconstitutional
if
you
have
it,
it
is
unconstitutional
if
you
don’t
have
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
charge
here
had
been
attempted
assault?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what’s
cfr?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
kind
of
a
court
is
the
cfr
court?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
you
got
indians.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
other
hand
if
the
discrimination
could
work
the
other
way,
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
justice
marshall
and
his
indian
friend
go
out
to
indian
country
and
both
commit
the
same
crime
if
it
is
not
a
crime,
if
it
is
one
of
the
13
listed
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
justice
marshall
would
be
tried
in
the
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
state
court,
that
is.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
under
the
federal
court
only
there’s
so
many
felony
concepts.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
of
the
defendant
of
the
person
charged?
justice
potter
stewart
and
sometimes
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
died
the
next
morning.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
thought
that
your
footnote
2
on
page
4
dealt
with
this
question?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
cite
nordelo
and
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
question
would
involve
the
construing
the
meaning
of
the
last
full
paragraph
of
18
u.s.c.
1153,
but
i
thought
this
issue
isn’t
here
since
you
point
out
there’s
no
question
about
the
fact
of
great
bodily
harm?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
case
which
one
of
those
three
was
it,
indian
against
indian?
justice
potter
stewart
