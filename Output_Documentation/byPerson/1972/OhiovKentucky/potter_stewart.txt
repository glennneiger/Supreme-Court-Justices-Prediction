that
was
somewhere
between
the
1792
line
and
the
present
line
on
the
north
shore?
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
originally
in
this
lawsuit
was
whether
or
not
the
low
water
mark
on
the
north
shore
was
that
of
1792
or
that
of
today.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
therefore,
i
would
guess,
i
will
assume
that
a
settlement
would
fix
the
line
somewhere
in
between
those
two?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
based,
however
on,
isn’t
it
on
ohio
supreme
court
decisions
at
least
in
part
of
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
which
the
special
master
could
take
judicial
notice
of?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
the
--
it’s
a
little
hard
to
conceptualize
in
a
normal
lawsuit,
let's
say,
bring
a
file
a
complaint
and
alleging
a
promise
without
consideration
to
give
me
a
thousand
dollars.
well,
as
a
matter
of
law
that
doesn’t
state
a
cause
of
action
upon
--
on
its
face
because
there
was
no
consideration
and
no
action
of
reliance
and
so
on.
you
could
still
file
that
complaint
but
it
would
be
dismissed
i
suppose
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
on
demurrer?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
all
the
facts
to
be
true.
it
simply
doesn’t
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
assuming
all
the
facts
to
be
true.
it
doesn’t
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
law,
the
law
in
this
case
not
being
the
general
law,
such
as
the
law
of
contracts,
but
the
law
that
the
boundary
between
kentucky
and
ohio
is
the
low
water
mark
of
the
northern
side
of
the
ohio
river.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
still,
i
suppose
that
the
complaint
as
a
release
to
the
technical,
logical,
symmetrical
matter
should
have
been
allowed
to
be
filed,
shouldn’t
it?
just
as
i
can
go
in
to
the
court,
a
trial
court
and
file
an
action
alleging
a
promise
without
consideration
to
pay
me
a
thousand
dollars
and
maybe
absolutely
no
good.
it
may
not
state
a
cause
of
action
because
there
was
no
consideration
or
its
equivalent
but
nonetheless
i
can
file
a
complaint,
can
i?
justice
potter
stewart
subject
to
a
demurrer
or
a
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
case,
i
just
have
remembered
argued
about
my
second
to
third
day
here
in
the
court
back
1958,
it's
reported
in
358
u.s.
page
64,
california
against
washington,
and
that
was
an
argument
on
a
motion
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint.
now,
that's
a
very
short
per
curiam
judgment,
the
motion
for
relief
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint
is
denied,
and
then
the
twenty-first
amendment
of
the
constitution
is
cited,
section
2
of
that
amendment
along
with
three
or
four
or
five
decided
cases
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
i.e.
on
the
merits
of
the
case
that
we
did
not
allow
the
complaint
to
be
filed,
and
the
cited
cases
go
into
the
merits
of
the
complaint
rather
than
allowing
the
complaint
to
be
filed
and
then
dismissing
it
on
the
merits
pointing
out
that
might
be
a
practical
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
358
u.s.
page
64.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
then
both
the
acquiescence
and
the
judicial
admissions
in
this
case,
i
suppose,
were
to
place
under
the
authority
of
this
court’s
decision
in
handly’s
lessee,
not
that
ohio
was
a
party
to
it
but
the
rational
of
that
case
was
very,
very
clear.
now,
this
court
in
the
past
has
reconsidered
the
earlier
decisions.
this
is
the
only
court
that
ohio
can
bring
a
lawsuit
against
kentucky
in.
this
is
a
case
not
only
about
original
jurisdiction
but
over
an
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
place
else
that
ohio
can
go
for
relief.
certainly
the
master,
in
this
case,
is
going
to
consider
our
existing
decisions
controlling,
but
shouldn’t
ohio
have
an
opportunity
to
ask
us
to
reconsider
the
rationale
of
previous
decision?
after
all,
it
wouldn’t
be
making
history
for
us
to
do
that
and
to
reconsider
previous
decision
and
overrule
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
was
all
done,
all
this
acquiescence
and
all
this
delay
and
all
this
judicial
admission
was
done
under
the
compulsion
of
ohio’s
understanding
of
the
existing
law
in
this
court.
but
shouldn’t
ohio
be
given
an
opportunity
to
ask
us
to
reconsider
and
review
the
existing
law
and
may
be
find
that
it
was
erroneous
in
the
first
place.
justice
potter
stewart
without
a
solid
historic
foundation.
justice
potter
stewart
what’s
the
--
may
i
ask,
what
is
the
practical
significance
outside
of
criminal
and
some
other
jurisdiction,
and
has
gas
been
discovered
up
around
portions
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
indiana,
i
mean
east
of
the
great
miami
river.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that’s
the
original
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
those
contracts
were
written
after
the
amended
complaint
and
this
case
was
offered,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
--
as
i
understood
your
--
what
you
told
us
about
the
history
of
litigation
--
this
original
complaint
was
filed
when,
back
in
1965?
justice
potter
stewart
66
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
by
reason
of
a
change
of
administration
or
other
reasons,
people
in
your
office
looked
at
it
and
there
was
nobody
familiar
with
it
and
you
began
to
study
of
it
and
then
and
only
then
back
four
or
five
years
after
the
original
complaint
was
filed
that
this
theory
was
discovered
or
evolved
or
of
whatever
that,
there
was
a
basis
of
the
amended
complaint
and
that
that
was
the
first
time
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
treaty
of
greenbelt,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
northwest
territory,
i’d
always
understood,
was
the
land
lying
north
of
the
ohio
river?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
your
claim
there
was
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
session
by
virginia
in
1784
was
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
a
kind
of
a
quick
claim
deed
but
it
wasn’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
it
may
have,
then
and
you
say
they
didn’t
have
anything
to
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
john
marshall
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
somewhere
between
the
1792
line
and
the
present
line
on
the
north
shore?
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
originally
in
