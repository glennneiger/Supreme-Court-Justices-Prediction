justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
special
master
independently
hold
that
wholly
aside
from
the
prior
adjudications
or
ohio’s
reaction
to
them
that
ohio
was
stopped
because
of
a
long
silence
over
a
--
with
respect
to
the
boundary?
justice
byron

white
filing
thesis
in
this
court
to
support
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
michigan
against
wisconsin
is
pretty
close
too,
wasn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
if
he
--
assume
he
was
right
in
that
view,
but
quite
wrong
in
saying
that
you
amend
to
complaint
the
state
of
cause
of
action.
the
complaint
nevertheless
shouldn’t
be
--
if
you
were
right
on
the
estoppel
point,
you
still
shouldn’t
--
that
the
amendment
still
shouldn’t
be
allowed,
should
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
knew
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
--
that
ohio
would
lose,
had
to
lose
because
it
stopped.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
because
i
just
assumed
it.
i
assumed
--
i
say
assume
the
master
was
right
in
his
ruling
here
which
he
--
of
course
if
he
is
wrong
in
that
ruling,
then
there’s
something
--
that’s
something
else
again,
but
if
he
is
right
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
holding
of
handly's
would
have
to
be
overruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rationale?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reason
it
would
give
a
judgment
to
the
winner
of
that
case
would
have
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
a
while
ago
that
according
to
your
case
was
that
as
the
matter
of
law,
even
accepted
the
allegation
as
true
that
the
dedication
by
virginia
been
accepted
by
the
united
states
as
a
matter
of
law
ended
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
the
special
master
held,
that
was
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
did
it
on
all
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
perhaps
it’s
that
--
perhaps
in
the
holding
of
the
ground
that
we
just
discussed
just
this
moment,
shouldn’t
you
complaint
that
that
have
been
allowed
to
be
filed,
to
be
amended?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
a
checker
or
checker
border
or
however
you
described
it
to
result
follow,
wouldn’t
you
have
one
rule
on
the
indiana
border
and
another
one
on
the
ohio
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
that
true
in
mississippi
between
illinois
and
missouri?
would
it
just
be
as
hard
there
as
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
we
heard
in
the
other
side
that
they
wanted
to
challenge
that
factually.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
can’t
say
undisputed,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
--
who
owns
the
--
you
have
gone
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
ohio
belongs
to
some
other
declaration.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that,
you
argue
that
congress
accepted
the
session?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
it
that
united
states
act
was
though
--
it
was
as
if
it
acquired
the
land
from
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
special
master
independently
hold
that
wholly
aside
from
the
prior
adjudications
or
ohio’s
reaction
to
them
that
ohio

well,
michigan
against
wisconsin
is
pretty
close

wasn’t
it?
justice
byron

white
well,
now
if
he
--
assume
he
was
right
in
that
view,
but
quite
wrong
in
saying
that
you
amend
to
complaint
the
state
of
cause
of
action.
the
complaint
nevertheless
shouldn’t
be
--
if
you
were
right
on
the
estoppel
point,
you
still
shouldn’t
--
that
the
amendment
still
shouldn’t
be
allowed,
should
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
knew
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
--
that
ohio
would
lose,
had
to
lose
because
it
stopped.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
because
i
just
assumed
it.
i
assumed
--
i
say
assume
the
master
was
right
in
his
ruling
here
which
he
--
of
course
if
he
is
wrong
in
that
ruling,
then
there’s
something

that’s
something
else
again,
but
if
he
is
right
in
that

justice
byron

white
the
holding
of
handly's
would
have
to
be
overruled?
justice
byron

the
rationale?
justice
byron

white
the
reason
it
would
give
a
judgment
to
the

of

that
is
what
the
special

held,
that
was
it.
justice
byron

white
well,
he
did
it
on
all
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron

perhaps
it’s
