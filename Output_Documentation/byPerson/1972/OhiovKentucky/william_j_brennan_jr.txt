well,
didn’t
the
master
at
page

expressly
say
and
on
the
basis
of
kentucky’s
open
and
continuous
assertion
and
exercise
of
dominion
to
that
point
without
formal
objection
by
ohio
for
more
than
150
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
from
what
you
said,
the
proceedings
from
--
before
judge
foreman
were
limited
simply
to
an
oral
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
facts
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
related
or
taken
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
on
the
face
of
the
amended
complaint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
the
fact
of
the
150
years
acquiescence
in
the
dominion
of
kentucky?
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apparently,
at
the
very
least,
we
have
to
disapprove
or
reject
that
the
tell
us
the
statement
at
page
5
from
handly,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
as
in
this
case
ones
there
is
a
recent
proprietor
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
have
to
be
rejected,
disapproved
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
the
reason
they
gave
the
court
between
their
judgments.
i
mean
there
is
another
reason
and
that
is
the
reason
they
gave.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
famularo,
what
is
this
counterclaim
that
you
mentioned
earlier
that
you
would
have
--
i
gather
kentucky
you
said
will
have
to
file
if
the
amended
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you’d
have
to
make
that
kind
of
record
in
the
event
that
ohio
should
prevail
and
its
claim
to
the
middle
of
the
river,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
would
file
the
counterclaim
i
gather,
but
would
you
have
to
try
it
until
the
issue
of
the
location
of
the
boundary
line
is
settled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
counterclaim,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
often
though
that
cuts
when
the
controversies
between
two
states
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
earlier,
to
give
considerable
attitude
to
the
states
to
have
their
claims
determined
when
the
controversy
with
the
sister
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
you
were
defending
of
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
on
the
basis
of
the
acquiescence
in
which
he
relied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
acquiescence
consisting
number
one
of
a
150
years,
number
two
of
the
concessions
made
in
the
original
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
because
of
any
decision
to
this
court,
but
because
of
the
action
of
the
congress
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
accepting
the
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
in
handly’s
that
was
the
interpretation
given
or
the
effect
given
the
session
plus
the
congressional
legislation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
even
that
could
be
reconsidered,
couldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
couldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
what’s
left
of
this
controversy
between
ohio
and
kentucky
if
we
accept
the
special
master’s
recommendation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you’d
still
have
to
resolve
this
question
where
the
low
water
mark
is,
whether
it’s
1792
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kinds
of
proofs
would
you
have
in
mind
to
offering
in
support
of
the
middle
of
the
river
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
acts
of
the
congress
in
recognizing
this
and
accepting
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understood
the
