mr.
john
m.
famularo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
howard
has
fairly
stated
the
facts
and
history
of
this
case.
however,
we
wish
to
emphasize
two
points
at
this
point.
first,
we
wish
to
point
out
that
kentucky
did
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
but
that
we
did
not
do
this
in
the
form
of
an
affirmative
defense.
we
rather
raised
it
as
a
point
of
law,
much
as
in
common
law
demurrer,
and
that
point
was
that
the
allegations
of
the
state
of
ohio
are
immaterial,
that
is,
if
they
are
true,
they
in
no
way
change
the
boundary
which
was
established
by
congress
long
ago
based
upon
the
session
of
virginia
and
the
acts
of
congress
thereto.
secondly,
we
wish
to
point
out
that
in
the
original
complaint
of
1966,
the
state
of
ohio
conceded
that
the
boundary
between
the
states
of
kentucky
and
ohio
was
the
low
water
mark
on
the
northern
shore
as
that
mark
existed
in
1792.
they
further
conceded
that
the
states
involved
in
the
handly
lessee
versus
anthony
case,
that
is,
indiana
and
kentucky,
should
control
as
between
ohio
and
kentucky
based
upon
the
identical
title
relationship
of
the
parties.
thus,
they
recognized
that
handly
was
controlling
and
should
control
as
between
ohio
and
kentucky.
and
they
have
recognized
this
for
more
than
150
years
since
the
decision
in
handly.
at
least
it
has
been
recognized
to
the
extent
that
they
were
judicially
aware
of
handly,
and
yet
have
set
by
inactively
for
a
period
of
at
least
150
years
until
the
amendment
is
now
sought
attempting
to
establish
the
boundary
in
the
middle
of
the
river.
we
submit
that
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
was
correct
for
two
basic
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
what
we
refer
to
as
the
immateriality
of
any
alleged
defect
in
the
title
of
virginia
where
the
boundary
was
clearly
fixed
by
congress
based
upon
the
session
of
virginia
and
the
acts
of
congress.
secondly,
we
submit
that
the
special
master’s
recommendation
was
correct
due
to
the
judicial
admissions
found
in
the
1966
pleadings
and
the
judicial
and
historical
acquiescence
upon
the
part
of
ohio
which
is
undisputed.
let
us
briefly
deal
with
the
first
allegation.
ohio
claims
that
the
boundary
is
in
the
middle
of
the
river
now,
based
upon
and
alleged
defect
in
virginia’s
title
due
to
various
pre-revolutionary
war
documents
and
actions
by
the
british
crown.
we
submit
that
after
the
revolutionary
war,
all
of
the
territories
situate
within
the
united
states
was
a
part
of
the
united
states
and
any
claim
are
derivative
claim
of
the
british
crown
was
clearly
extinguished
by
the
results
of
the
revolutionary
war.
once
virginia
ceded
the
land,
situate
lying
and
being
to
the
north
of
the
river
ohio
for
the
sole
purpose
of
creating
new
states
and
once
the
sovereign
united
states
accepted
this
session
and
the
terms
thereof
and
recognize
the
sovereignty
of
virginia
over
the
entire
river,
any
defect
in
that
title
to
the
land
north
of
the
river
is
clearly
immaterial.
the
only
two
parties
involved,
the
sovereign
state
of
virginia
and
the
sovereign
united
states
based
upon
the
negotiations
involved,
recognized
that
the
boundary
was
to
be
on
the
northern
shore.
certainly,
they
had
the
authority
to
act
and
did
so.
and
the
boundary
was
clearly
established
as
residing
within
virginia
on
the
northern
shore
and
all
the
land
south
of
the
river.
this
was
determined
long
before
the
state
of
ohio
was
ever
created.
and
ohio
was
in
no
position
now
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
province
of
quebec
or
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
indians.
it
can
only
vindicate
any
rights
that
they’ve
acquired
since
they
became
a
state.
and
we
submit
that
clearly
the
boundary
was
determined
based
upon
the
acceptance
of
congress
of
the
virginia
session.
it
is
that
law
that
is
the
law
of
the
sovereign
united
states
which
must
govern
this
boundary
dispute
and
not
the
law
of
any
foreign
political
entity.
the
special
master
has
not
rejected
this
as
ohio
claims
and
if
indeed
it
--
judge
foreman
did,
this
court
can
certainly
hold
otherwise.
we
submit
that
the
session
of
virginia
and
the
legislative
enactments
did
indeed
become
the
subject
of
judicial
interpretation.
in
handly’s
lessee
versus
anthony,
the
supreme
court
judicially
recognized
and
accepted
the
legislative
enactments
involved
and
resolved
the
boundary
dispute
reasoning
to
the
language
of
that
session
of
virginia
itself
and
also
to
the
acts
of
congress
involved.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
certainly,
the
courts
have
been
lenient
in
this
regard,
your
honor.
however,
we
submit
that
they
had
not
been
lenient
in
this
regard
where
indeed
the
factual
allegations
taken
upon
the
sufficiency
of
their
face
do
not
establish
as
a
matter
of
law
or
cause
of
action.
and
we
submit
that
any
alleged
title
defect
in
virginia’s
land,
as
we
have
previously
pointed
out
in
our
argument
so
far,
is
clearly
immaterial
and
to
tie
up
the
court
and
to
bring
in
such
an
immaterial
claim
would
in
no
way
resolve
the
matter
or
would
in
no
way
achieve
the
expediency
which
the
court
strive
for.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
without
going
outside
the
record,
your
honor,
i
think
it
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
would
be
a
totally
and
completely
burdensome
task.
it
would,
in
all
likelihood,
truly
involve
a
counterclaim
as
what’s
suggested
in
the
hearing
before
the
special
master.
this,
in
itself,
would
be
an
onerous
task
in
trying
to
compute
all
of
the
expenditures
overall
of
the
years.
and
where
the
allegation
is
completely
immaterial
as
we
submit
it
is,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
not
consider
this
and
should
not
be
burden
with
this
task
and
the
special
master
correctly
so
held.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
yes,
this
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
basically
what
the
special
master
did
was
that
reasoning
more
to
the
theory
of
acquiescence
than
to
our
initial
theory
here
of
the
immateriality
of
any
alleged
defect
in
virginia.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
right,
he
stated
the
theory
of
acquiescence
to
give
validity
to
this
argument
and
to
set
forth
the
rational.
however,
such
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that
is
basically
our
contention.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
yes
mr.
justice,
subject
to
the
demurrer.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
subject
to
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
however,
it
must
be
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true.
we
are
making
that
statement,
and
we
submit
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
he
did
not
reject
this
theory.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
no,
it’s
not.
he
based
his
upon
the
theory
of
acquiescence.
however,
we
submit
that
he
did
not
reject
this
theory
and
clearly
the
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
since
this
was
an
original
proceeding
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
technical
rules
actually
are
not
followed
and
this
court
looks
to
them
for
guidance,
if
indeed
this
were
the
typical
lawsuit
between
the
average
parties
then
in
all
likelihood
exactly
what
you’re
saying
would
be
correct.
but
in
the
original
proceeding
where
the
court
strives
to
get
the
issues
before
it
and
tries
to
eliminate
any
burdensome
issues,
which
we
submit
that
the
boundary
in
the
middle
of
the
river
clearly
is,
it
should
be
rejected
and
this
forms
the
basis
of
our
contention.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
i
think
that
is
--
that's
a
sound
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
yes,
it
would
be
a
counterclaim
basically
for
expenditures
over
all
of
the
years
mr.
justice
brennan
in
excess
of
the
middle
of
the
river
to
the
far
side.
if
indeed
ohio
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that’s
right.
but
would
you
have
to
make
that
kind
of
record
until
actually
ohio
had
prevailed,
if
it
did?
i
think
to
protect
the
record
of
the
case
and
to
protect
our
interest,
once
the
amended
complaint
is
allowed
to
be
filed
and
as
a
protective
device
for
the
common
law
of
kentucky
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
would
we
have
to
try
the
counterclaim?
mr.
john
m.
famularo
no,
in
all
likelihood
we
would
not
because
of
the
expenditures
would
be
for
the
area
line
north
of
the
river
and
to
the
northern
shore.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
well
certainly
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
certainly,
the
right
of
the
trial
court
to
grant
an
amendment
mr.
chief
justice
would
be
infringed
upon
how
that
right
is
not
absolute
and
there
are
various
motions
to
be
filed
for
leave
of
court
in
which
the
grounds
are
spelled
out,
and
certainly
this
court
is
aware.
after
the
responsive
pleadings
are
filed,
and
that
if
that
motion
or
if
that
attempt
to
file
the
amended
complaint
shows
that
as
a
matter
of
law
nothing
would
be
accomplished
by
it,
i
don’t
think
the
rights
of
the
trial
court
in
this
regard
are
so
abruptly
encroached
upon
that
as
a
matter
of
expediency
such
could
not
be
held
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true.
however,
if
i
had
the
language
of
mr.
justice
stewart’s
case
before
me,
i
might
be
better
able
to
answer
this
question.
not
having
it,
i
can
only
again
state
that
i
think
for
expediency
in
a
matter
especially
in
an
original
proceeding
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that’s
true.
the
uniqueness
of
the
original
proceeding
is
something
to
be
considered
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
we
submit
that
in
a
close
examination
of
the
facts
before
this
court
as
little
as
they
may
be
at
this
point.
the
pleadings
themselves
establish
as
we
have
pointed
out
that
any
defect
in
the
land
lying
northwest
of
the
ohio
river
is
immaterial.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
i
am
going
to
get
into
that
right
now
and
we
will
say
the
same
thing.
we
think
that
the
special
master
was
correct
in
applying
that
based
upon
acquiescence
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
the
motion
for
leave
to
deny
should
be
--
the
motion
for
a
leave
to
amend
should
be
denied.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
exactly,
those
two
things.
the
judicial
admissions
made
in
the
1966
pleadings,
the
inactivity
of
over
150
years
by
the
state
of
ohio,
while
kentucky
has
continuously
exerted
control
over
the
river
in
all
of
its
dealings,
although
they
are
not
specifically
a
part
of
the
record.
moreover,
kentucky’s
legislature
as
early
as
1810
attempted
to
alleviate
the
problem
as
to
the
boundary
questions
before
handly’s
lessee
was
even
decided.
yet,
ohio’s
legislature
apparently
has
made
no
such
attempts.
for
150
years,
ohio
has
been
satisfied
and
being
aware
of
the
judicial
determination
in
handly’s
lessee
versus
anthony
and
indiana
versus
kentucky,
but
yet
has
made
no
attempts
to
clarify
that
insofar
as
it
relates
to
them.
now
they
claim
that
they
are
not
a
party
to
--
that
was
litigations
and
therefore
they’re
not
bound
by
them.
before
getting
into
the
master’s
acquiescence
theory,
i
would
like
to
briefly
respond
to
that
allegation.
to
say
that
they
are
not
bound
by
that
in
the
strict
sense
is
correct.
they
were
not
a
party.
however,
we
submit
that
such
a
contention
is
certainly
undermined
by
their
judicial
admissions.
certainly
such
a
contention
is
undermined
by
the
lapse
of
time
involved
and
finally
such
a
contention
is
undermined
by
the
holding
of
the
special
master
that
such
a
contention
would
create
a
checkered
river
contrary
to
the
intentions
of
congress
and
the
intentions
of
the
state
of
virginia
and
would
be
totally
in
ascertainable.
no
one
would
no
where
the
boundary
would
be.
based
upon
that,
we
submit
that
ohio
cannot
claim
that
she
was
not
a
party.
and
finally
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
well,
this
would
be
true
but
on
the
river,
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
ascertain
where
the
boundary
of
ohio
stops
or
where
the
boundary
of,
let’s
say,
illinois
or
indiana
starts.
for
the
average
fisherman
or
the
average
tugboat
operator
or
the
average
beer
distributor
on
the
river
and
restaurant
attached
to
the
dock,
it
would
be
hard
to
ascertain
which
is
ohio
and
which
is
illinois,
and
such
would
be
a
checkered
fashion.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
it
would
be,
but
such
does
not
make
the
result
anymore
correct.
finally,
we
submit
that
the
report
of
the
special
master
was
correct
in
recommending
that
the
motion
for
leave
to
amend
be
denied
based
upon
the
judicial
admissions
and
based
upon
the
judicial
and
historical
acquiescence
upon
the
part
of
the
state
of
ohio.
ohio’s
court
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
we
submit
that
ohio
based
upon
its
long
delay
and
more
importantly
based
upon
the
continuous
dominion
by
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
should
not
be
allowed
at
this
point
to
change
its
total
theory.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
well,
we
submit
that
such
should
not
be
done,
your
honor
based
upon
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
we
submit
that
such
should
not
be
done
based
upon
our
first
argument
that
even
if
they
have
this
attempt
that
it
will
fail
as
a
matter
of
law
as
the
special
master
held
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that’s
right.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
and
in
no
way
has
that
reasoning
been
detracted
from
by
any
decision.
in
fact
it
was
reaffirmed
in
handly.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
and
specifically
determined
about
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
the
intentions
of
congress
and
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
i
suppose
it
could
be,
but
again
we
fall
back
upon
our
first
argument
that
that
such
would
be
to
inject
in
this
proceeding
at
this
time
an
immaterial
point.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
if
the
special
master’s
recommendation
was
accepted,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
would
leave
the
litigation
in
the
state
of
the
original
complaint
being
filed
and
our
answer
being
filed.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
or
whether
it’s
the
present
low
water
mark.
it’s
as
setup
in
an
affirmative
defense
in
our
answer.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
outside
of
the
record,
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
it
is
that,
there
has
been
some
minerals
found
in
and
around
the
henderson
area
which
is
across
of
evansville,
indiana.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
the
problems
of
licensing
of
boats,
of
licensing
of
fisherman,
hunters,
the
licensing
and
taxing,
all
of
these
are
posing
critical
questions
that
need
to
be
resolved
in
terms
of
the
boundary
and
its
--
the
dealings
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
we
think
have
been
consisted
with
the
boundary
at
the
present
low
water
mark
without
getting
into
that
at
this
point.
certainly,
that
--
those
facts
are
not
part
of
this
record.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that’s
right.
the
basis
of
our
acquiescence
claim
is
that
this
court
can
certainly
judicially
notice
the
undisputed
judicial
admission,
and
judicially
notice
the
undisputed
judicial
admissions
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
can
judicially
notice
the
undisputed
historical
facts
that
is
the
continuous
dominion
and
control
over
the
ohio
river
by
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
and
the
undisputed
delay
and
inactivity
and
silence
by
the
state
of
ohio
based
upon
the
judicial
notice
of
this
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
they
do;
they
do
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
what’s
undisputed,
we
submit,
is
a
matter
of
law.
the
judicial
admissions
as
a
matter
of
law
we
submit
speak
for
themselves
and
this
court
can
certainly
judicially
notice
them.
the
historical
facts
at
least
insofar
as
we
have
stated,
that
is,
the
continuous
dominion
by
the
state
of
kentucky
and
the
silence
by
the
state
of
ohio
is
an
undisputed
fact
and
this
court
can
certainly
judicially
notice
that
and
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
well,
certainly
we
submit
that
it
is
more
than
enough
evidence
to
establish
that
any
attempt
of
ohio
to
now
say
that
the
boundary
is
in
the
middle,
is
improper
at
this
time.
be
at
by
motion
to
dismiss
or
whatever.
we
submit
that
these
theories
and
that
this
undisputed
facts
clearly
substantiate
our
views.
and
as
a
matter
of
law
entitle
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
to
a
ruling
at
this
point
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
fail
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
they
cannot
be
overcome.
true,
ohio
may
have
many
other
facts
that
they
can
introduce.
however,
those
facts
can
in
no
way,
we
submit,
overcome,
that
which
is
already
been
transpired
in
the
past.
and
again
we
fall
back
upon
our
first
argument
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
expediency
of
this
matter
in
the
original
proceeding
should
attempt
to
prohibit
and
avoid
any
such
circumvention
of
the
most
direct
route.
based
upon
this,
we
submit
that
the
finding
of
the
special
master
was
correct
insofar
as
it
denied
the
motion
for
leave
to
amend.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
howard
has
fairly
stated
the
facts
and
history
of
this
case.
however,
we
wish
to
emphasize
two
points
at
this
point.
first,
we
wish
to
point
out
that
kentucky
did
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
but
that
we
did
not
do
this
in
the
form
of
an
affirmative
defense.
we
rather
raised
it
as
a
point
of
law,
much
as
in
common
law
demurrer,
and
that
point
was
that
the
allegations
of
the
state
of
ohio
are
immaterial,
that
is,
if
they
are
true,
they
in
no
way
change
the
boundary
which
was
established
by
congress
long
ago
based
upon
the
session
of
virginia
and
the
acts
of
congress
thereto.
secondly,
we
wish
to
point
out
that
in
the
original
complaint
of
1966,
the
state
of
ohio
conceded
that
the
boundary
between
the
states
of
kentucky
and
ohio
was
the
low
water
mark
on
the
northern
shore
as
that
mark
existed
in
1792.
they
further
conceded
that
the
states
involved
in
the
handly
lessee
versus
anthony
case,
that
is,
indiana
and
kentucky,
should
control
as
between
ohio
and
kentucky
based
upon
the
identical
title
relationship
of
the
parties.
thus,
they
recognized
that
handly
was
controlling
and
should
control
as
between
ohio
and
kentucky.
and
they
have
recognized
this
for
more
than
150
years
since
the
decision
in
handly.
at
least
it
has
been
recognized
to
the
extent
that
they
were
judicially
aware
of
handly,
and
yet
have
set
by
inactively
for
a
period
of
at
least
150
years
until
the
amendment
is
now
sought
attempting
to
establish
the
boundary
in
the
middle
of
the
river.
we
submit
that
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
was
correct
for
two
basic
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
what
we
refer
to
as
the
immateriality
of
any
alleged
defect
in
the
title
of
virginia
where
the
boundary
was
clearly
fixed
by
congress
based
upon
the
session
of
virginia
and
the
acts
of
congress.
secondly,
we
submit
that
the
special
master’s
recommendation
was
correct
due
to
the
judicial
admissions
found
in
the
1966
pleadings
and
the
judicial
and
historical
acquiescence
upon
the
part
of
ohio
which
is
undisputed.
let
us
briefly
deal
with
the
first
allegation.
ohio
claims
that
the
boundary
is
in
the
middle
of
the
river
now,
based
upon
and
alleged
defect
in
virginia’s
title
due
to
various
pre-revolutionary
war
documents
and
actions
by
the
british
crown.
we
submit
that
after
the
revolutionary
war,
all
of
the
territories
situate
within
the
united
states
was
a
part
of
the
united
states
and
any
claim
are
derivative
claim
of
the
british
crown
was
clearly
extinguished
by
the
results
of
the
revolutionary
war.
once
virginia
ceded
the
land,
situate
lying
and
being
to
the
north
of
the
river
ohio
for
the
sole
purpose
of
creating
new
states
and
once
the
sovereign
united
states
accepted
this
session
and
the
terms
thereof
and
recognize
the
sovereignty
of
virginia
over
the
entire
river,
any
defect
in
that
title
to
the
land
north
of
the
river
is
clearly
immaterial.
the
only
two
parties
involved,
the
sovereign
state
of
virginia
and
the
sovereign
united
states
based
upon
the
negotiations
involved,
recognized
that
the
boundary
was
to
be
on
the
northern
shore.
certainly,
they
had
the
authority
to
act
and
did
so.
and
the
boundary
was
clearly
established
as
residing
within
virginia
on
the
northern
shore
and
all
the
land
south
of
the
river.
this
was
determined
long
before
the
state
of
ohio
was
ever
created.
and
ohio
was
in
no
position
now
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
province
of
quebec
or
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
indians.
it
can
only
vindicate
any
rights
that
they’ve
acquired
since
they
became
a
state.
and
we
submit
that
clearly
the
boundary
was
determined
based
upon
the
acceptance
of
congress
of
the
virginia
session.
it
is
that
law
that
is
the
law
of
the
sovereign
united
states
which
must
govern
this
boundary
dispute
and
not
the
law
of
any
foreign
political
entity.
the
special
master
has
not
rejected
this
as
ohio
claims
and
if
indeed
it
--
judge
foreman
did,
this
court
can
certainly
hold
otherwise.
we
submit
that
the
session
of
virginia
and
the
legislative
enactments
did
indeed
become
the
subject
of
judicial
interpretation.
in
handly’s
lessee
versus
anthony,
the
supreme
court
judicially
recognized
and
accepted
the
legislative
enactments
involved
and
resolved
the
boundary
dispute
reasoning
to
the
language
of
that
session
of
virginia
itself
and
also
to
the
acts
of
congress
involved.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
certainly,
the
courts
have
been
lenient
in
this
regard,
your
honor.
however,
we
submit
that
they
had
not
been
lenient
in
this
regard
where
indeed
the
factual
allegations
taken
upon
the
sufficiency
of
their
face
do
not
establish
as
a
matter
of
law
or
cause
of
action.
and
we
submit
that
any
alleged
title
defect
in
virginia’s
land,
as
we
have
previously
pointed
out
in
our
argument
so
far,
is
clearly
immaterial
and
to
tie
up
the
court
and
to
bring
in
such
an
immaterial
claim
would
in
no
way
resolve
the
matter
or
would
in
no
way
achieve
the
expediency
which
the
court
strive
for.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
without
going
outside
the
record,
your
honor,
i
think
it
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
would
be
a
totally
and
completely
burdensome
task.
it
would,
in
all
likelihood,
truly
involve
a
counterclaim
as
what’s
suggested
in
the
hearing
before
the
special
master.
this,
in
itself,
would
be
an
onerous
task
in
trying
to
compute
all
of
the
expenditures
overall
of
the
years.
and
where
the
allegation
is
completely
immaterial
as
we
submit
it
is,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
not
consider
this
and
should
not
be
burden
with
this
task
and
the
special
master
correctly
so
held.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
yes,
this
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
basically
what
the
special
master
did
was
that
reasoning
more
to
the
theory
of
acquiescence
than
to
our
initial
theory
here
of
the
immateriality
of
any
alleged
defect
in
virginia.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
right,
he
stated
the
theory
of
acquiescence
to
give
validity
to
this
argument
and
to
set
forth
the
rational.
however,
such
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that
is
basically
our
contention.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
yes
mr.
justice,
subject
to
the
demurrer.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
subject
to
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
however,
it
must
be
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true.
we
are
making
that
statement,
and
we
submit
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
he
did
not
reject
this
theory.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
no,
it’s
not.
he
based
his
upon
the
theory
of
acquiescence.
however,
we
submit
that
he
did
not
reject
this
theory
and
clearly
the
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
since
this
was
an
original
proceeding
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
technical
rules
actually
are
not
followed
and
this
court
looks
to
them
for
guidance,
if
indeed
this
were
the
typical
lawsuit
between
the
average
parties
then
in
all
likelihood
exactly
what
you’re
saying
would
be
correct.
but
in
the
original
proceeding
where
the
court
strives
to
get
the
issues
before
it
and
tries
to
eliminate
any
burdensome
issues,
which
we
submit
that
the
boundary
in
the
middle
of
the
river
clearly
is,
it
should
be
rejected
and
this
forms
the
basis
of
our
contention.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
i
think
that
is
--
that's
a
sound
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
yes,
it
would
be
a
counterclaim
basically
for
expenditures
over
all
of
the
years
mr.
justice
brennan
in
excess
of
the
middle
of
the
river
to
the
far
side.
if
indeed
ohio
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that’s
right.
but
would
you
have
to
make
that
kind
of
record
until
actually
ohio
had
prevailed,
if
it
did?
i
think
to
protect
the
record
of
the
case
and
to
protect
our
interest,
once
the
amended
complaint
is
allowed
to
be
filed
and
as
a
protective
device
for
the
common
law
of
kentucky
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
would
we
have
to
try
the
counterclaim?
mr.
john
m.
famularo
no,
in
all
likelihood
we
would
not
because
of
the
expenditures
would
be
for
the
area
line
north
of
the
river
and
to
the
northern
shore.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
well
certainly
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
certainly,
the
right
of
the
trial
court
to
grant
an
amendment
mr.
chief
justice
would
be
infringed
upon
how
that
right
is
not
absolute
and
there
are
various
motions
to
be
filed
for
leave
of
court
in
which
the
grounds
are
spelled
out,
and
certainly
this
court
is
aware.
after
the
responsive
pleadings
are
filed,
and
that
if
that
motion
or
if
that
attempt
to
file
the
amended
complaint
shows
that
as
a
matter
of
law
nothing
would
be
accomplished
by
it,
i
don’t
think
the
rights
of
the
trial
court
in
this
regard
are
so
abruptly
encroached
upon
that
as
a
matter
of
expediency
such
could
not
be
held
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true.
however,
if
i
had
the
language
of
mr.
justice
stewart’s
case
before
me,
i
might
be
better
able
to
answer
this
question.
not
having
it,
i
can
only
again
state
that
i
think
for
expediency
in
a
matter
especially
in
an
original
proceeding
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that’s
true.
the
uniqueness
of
the
original
proceeding
is
something
to
be
considered
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
this
is
true
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
we
submit
that
in
a
close
examination
of
the
facts
before
this
court
as
little
as
they
may
be
at
this
point.
the
pleadings
themselves
establish
as
we
have
pointed
out
that
any
defect
in
the
land
lying
northwest
of
the
ohio
river
is
immaterial.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
i
am
going
to
get
into
that
right
now
and
we
will
say
the
same
thing.
we
think
that
the
special
master
was
correct
in
applying
that
based
upon
acquiescence
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
the
motion
for
leave
to
deny
should
be
--
the
motion
for
a
leave
to
amend
should
be
denied.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
exactly,
those
two
things.
the
judicial
admissions
made
in
the
1966
pleadings,
the
inactivity
of
over
150
years
by
the
state
of
ohio,
while
kentucky
has
continuously
exerted
control
over
the
river
in
all
of
its
dealings,
although
they
are
not
specifically
a
part
of
the
record.
moreover,
kentucky’s
legislature
as
early
as
1810
attempted
to
alleviate
the
problem
as
to
the
boundary
questions
before
handly’s
lessee
was
even
decided.
yet,
ohio’s
legislature
apparently
has
made
no
such
attempts.
for
150
years,
ohio
has
been
satisfied
and
being
aware
of
the
judicial
determination
in
handly’s
lessee
versus
anthony
and
indiana
versus
kentucky,
but
yet
has
made
no
attempts
to
clarify
that
insofar
as
it
relates
to
them.
now
they
claim
that
they
are
not
a
party
to
--
that
was
litigations
and
therefore
they’re
not
bound
by
them.
before
getting
into
the
master’s
acquiescence
theory,
i
would
like
to
briefly
respond
to
that
allegation.
to
say
that
they
are
not
bound
by
that
in
the
strict
sense
is
correct.
they
were
not
a
party.
however,
we
submit
that
such
a
contention
is
certainly
undermined
by
their
judicial
admissions.
certainly
such
a
contention
is
undermined
by
the
lapse
of
time
involved
and
finally
such
a
contention
is
undermined
by
the
holding
of
the
special
master
that
such
a
contention
would
create
a
checkered
river
contrary
to
the
intentions
of
congress
and
the
intentions
of
the
state
of
virginia
and
would
be
totally
in
ascertainable.
no
one
would
no
where
the
boundary
would
be.
based
upon
that,
we
submit
that
ohio
cannot
claim
that
she
was
not
a
party.
and
finally
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
well,
this
would
be
true
but
on
the
river,
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
ascertain
where
the
boundary
of
ohio
stops
or
where
the
boundary
of,
let’s
say,
illinois
or
indiana
starts.
for
the
average
fisherman
or
the
average
tugboat
operator
or
the
average
beer
distributor
on
the
river
and
restaurant
attached
to
the
dock,
it
would
be
hard
to
ascertain
which
is
ohio
and
which
is
illinois,
and
such
would
be
a
checkered
fashion.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
it
would
be,
but
such
does
not
make
the
result
anymore
correct.
finally,
we
submit
that
the
report
of
the
special
master
was
correct
in
recommending
that
the
motion
for
leave
to
amend
be
denied
based
upon
the
judicial
admissions
and
based
upon
the
judicial
and
historical
acquiescence
upon
the
part
of
the
state
of
ohio.
ohio’s
court
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
we
submit
that
ohio
based
upon
its
long
delay
and
more
importantly
based
upon
the
continuous
dominion
by
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
should
not
be
allowed
at
this
point
to
change
its
total
theory.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
well,
we
submit
that
such
should
not
be
done,
your
honor
based
upon
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
we
submit
that
such
should
not
be
done
based
upon
our
first
argument
that
even
if
they
have
this
attempt
that
it
will
fail
as
a
matter
of
law
as
the
special
master
held
to

mr.
john
m.
famularo
that’s
right.
mr.
john

famularo
and
in
no
way
has
that
reasoning
been
detracted
from
by
any
decision.
in
fact
it
was
reaffirmed
in

mr.
john

specifically
determined
about

mr.
john

the
intentions
of
congress
and
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
i
suppose
it
could
be,
but
again
we
fall
back
upon
our
first
argument
that
that
such
would
be
to
inject
in
this
proceeding
at
this
time
an
immaterial
point.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
if
the
special
master’s
recommendation
was
accepted,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
would
leave
the
litigation
in
the
state
of
the
original
complaint
being
filed
and
our
answer
being
filed.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
or
whether
it’s
the
present
low
water
mark.
it’s
as
setup
in
an
affirmative
defense
in
our
answer.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
outside
of
the
record,
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
it
is
that,
there
has
been
some
minerals
found
in
and
around
the
henderson
area
which
is
across
of
evansville,
indiana.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
the
problems
of
licensing
of
boats,
of
licensing
of
fisherman,
hunters,
the
licensing
and
taxing,
all
of
these
are
posing
critical
questions
that
need
to
be
resolved
in
terms
of
the
boundary
and
its
--
the
dealings
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
we
think
have
been
consisted
with
the
boundary
at
the
present
low
water
mark
without
getting
into
that
at
this
point.
certainly,
that
--
those
facts
are
not
part
of
this
record.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
that’s
right.
the
basis
of
our
acquiescence
claim
is
that
this
court
can
certainly
judicially
notice
the
undisputed
judicial
admission,
and
judicially
notice
the
undisputed
judicial
admissions
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
can
judicially
notice
the
undisputed
historical
facts
that
is
the
continuous
dominion
and
control
over
the
ohio
river
by
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
and
the
undisputed
delay
and
inactivity
and
silence
by
the
state
of
ohio
based
upon
the
judicial
notice
of
this
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
they
do;
they
do
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
m.
famularo
what’s
undisputed,
we
submit,
is
a
matter
of
law.
the
judicial
admissions
as
a
matter
of
law
we
submit
speak
for
themselves
and
this
court
can
certainly
judicially
notice
them.
the
historical
facts
at
least
insofar
as
we
have
stated,
that
is,
the
continuous
dominion
by
the
state
of
kentucky
and
the
silence
by
the
state
of
ohio
is
an
undisputed
fact
and
this
court
can
certainly
judicially
notice
that
and
--
mr.
john
m.
famularo
well,
certainly
we
submit
that
it
is
more
than
enough
evidence
to
establish
that
any
attempt
of
ohio
to
now
say
that
the
boundary
is
in
the
middle,
is
improper
at
this
time.
be
at
by
motion
to
dismiss
or
whatever.
we
submit
that
these
theories
and
that
this
undisputed
facts
clearly
substantiate
our
views.
and
as
a
matter
of
law
entitle
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
to
a
ruling
at
this
point
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
fail
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
they
cannot
be
overcome.
true,
ohio
may
have
many
other
facts
that
they
can
introduce.
however,
those
facts
can
in
no
way,
we
submit,
overcome,
that
which
is
already
been
transpired
in
the
past.
and
again
we
fall
back
upon
our
first
argument
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
expediency
of
this
matter
in
the
original
proceeding
should
attempt
to
prohibit
and
avoid
any
such
circumvention
of
the
most
direct
route.
based
upon
this,
we
submit
that
the
finding
of
the
special
master
was
correct
insofar
as
it
denied
the
motion
for
leave
to
amend.
