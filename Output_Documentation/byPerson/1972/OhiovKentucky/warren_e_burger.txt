we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in

27
original,
the
state
of
ohio
against
the
state
of
kentucky.
mr.
howard,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief

it’s
always
a
good
time
to
stop,
counsel.
in
addition
to
it,
it’s
lunch
time.
chief

mr.
famularo.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
correct
me
now
mr.
famularo
if
i’m
confused.
isn’t
the
central
issue
here
whether
an
amendment
should
be
allowed
at
this
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hasn’t
the
court
historically
been
rather
generous
in
allowing
amendments
particularly
in
actions
between
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
to
suggest
about
the
scope
of
the
factual
matter
that
would
have
to
be
dealt
with
if
an
amendment
should
be
allowed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
it
was
sort
of
a
demurrer
approach,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
he
acted
on
that
theory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
seems
to
me
that
that
to
reverse
and
say
that
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
file
would
be
going
around
the
circle
of
the
matter.
it
seems
more
critical
that
the
court
should
and
could
look
to
the
facts
and
take
judicial
notice
of
any
undisputed
facts
that
are
in
the
record
and
prohibit
such
a
proceeding
from
developing,
and
i
think
this
is
exactly
--
no
but
do
you
think
doesn’t
that
deprive
the
trial
court
of
its
inherent
right
to
permit
an
amendment
to
the
complaint?
inherent
power,
i
should
say.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
obviously,
it’s
an
economical
and
an
efficient
proceeding,
but
litigation
isn’t
always
efficient.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
very
holding
of
the
reviewing
court
in
this
common
law
hypothetical
case,
the
very
theory
of
the
appellate
court’s
action
might
put
the
parties,
the
party
on
notice
as
to
how
he
might
appropriately
amend
his
complaint.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
one
basic
difference
is
that
we,
unlike
an
appellate
court
in
a
state
common
law
system,
have
plenary
power.
we
are
the
original
court
here.
