mr.
joseph
m.
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
by
the
state
of
ohio
requesting
a
determination
of
the
location
of
its
boundary
with
kentucky
in
the
ohio
river.
the
only
question
presently
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
ohio
shall
be
permitted
to
amend
its
original
complaint.
that
original
complaint
was
filed
back
in
1966.
at
that
time,
ohio
claimed
that
the
boundary
existed
at
the
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
of
the
river,
that
is
on
the
ohio
side,
as
it
stood
in
1792,
which
was
the
day
at
which
kentucky
became
a
state.
kentucky
filed
an
answer
and
it
claimed
that
the
boundary
lay
at
the
present
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
on
the
ohio
side.
that,
of
course,
was
much
farther
up
on
the
ohio
shore
than
the
old
1792
line,
because
of
the
new
dams
which
have
been
put
in
on
the
ohio
river
beginning
in
back
in
1890,
the
planning
began.
the
dams
were
erected.
i
think
the
first
set
of
them
were
completed
in
1925,
and
then
in
the
50’s
a
new
set
of
high
level
dams
began
to
be
erected
by
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
and
that
caused
a
much
higher
level
of
the
water
and
further
inundation
on
the
ohio
side.
well,
the
issues
were
joined
on
the
original
complaint
in
the
answer.
and
this
court
appointed
the
master
and
there
were
quite
a
number
of
conferences
between
the
master
and
counsel
as
to
how
the
case
should
be
conducted
and
the
evidence
presented.
there
were
a
great
number
of
conferences
apparently
between
counsels
on
both
sides
determining
just
what
the
evidence
would
be.
and
in
july
1970,
ohio
made
an
offer
of
settlement.
as
i
recall,
it
was
250
feet
up
into
the
river.
i
may
be
mistaken
on
the
exact
figures
on
that
but
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i
am
not
sure
your
honor
exactly
what.
i
would
guess
it
would
have
been
above
the
1792
line.
that’s
my
guess.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right;
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
i
have
not
gotten
into
that
part
of
it
yet
at
all,
and
i
can’t
say;
i’m
guessing
that
it
was
closer
to
what
ohio
wanted
than
what
kentucky
felt
ohio
should
get.
apparently,
from
what
i
can
gather
from
the
master’s
comments
and
from
what
i’ve
seen
in
the
file,
counsel
on
both
sides
felt
that
there
were
some
chance
that
this
would
be
accepted.
at
least
they
were
content.
nobody
could
tell
of
course
what
the
legislatures
or
the
executive
part
on
either
of
the
states
would
have
done.
so,
it
had
gone
just
that
far
that
the
offer
was
made.
unfortunately,
the
counsel
for
state
of
kentucky,
john
browning,
who
had
been
handling
the
case
since
the
very
outset
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
about
two
weeks
after
the
offer
was
made.
ultimately,
in
november
1970,
kentucky
simply
rejected
the
offer.
that
was
in
november.
a
little
over
a
month
later,
the
administration
in
ohio
changed.
a
new
attorney
general
came
in
and
he
asked
--
well,
nobody
in
was
left
on
the
staff
who
had
worked
on
this
case
at
all.
so
he
asked
that
a
complete
reexamination
of
the
file
and
everything
connected
with
it
be
made.
that
was
done
and
after
about
four
or
five
months
study,
recommendation
was
made
to
the
attorney
general
that
an
effort
be
made
to
ask
this
court
to
permit
an
amendment
of
the
complaint
in
order
to
permit
ohio
to
make
an
argument
that
it
was
entitled
to
a
line
in
the
middle
of
the
river.
we
didn’t
want
to
go
off
the
deep
end
on
this
without
checking
and
we
called
the
attorney
general’s
office
in
kentucky
and
asked
him
to
look
through
mr.
browning’s
files
and
see
whether
there
was
anything
that
would
make
it
clear
that
we
were
in
error,
that
we
couldn’t
possibly
prevail
on
that
argument.
well,
we
got
no
answer
from
that
call.
and
eventually
we
filed
the
motion
to
amend
the
complaint
which
is
pending
before
the
court
at
the
present
time.
that
was
done
in
august
1971.
and
what
we
did
was
to
add
the
first
count
of
the
complaint
that
is
alleging
that
the
real
boundary
between
the
two
states
lies
in
the
middle
of
the
river,
and
then
there
were
some
minor
alterations
in
the
further
parts
of
the
original
complaint
that
is,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
on
the
--
permitting
us
to
amend
the
or
to
--
or
if
the
master
were
to
find
against
us
on
the
middle
of
the
river,
then
we
would
still
argue
for
the
1792
line.
and
the
third
question
involved
is
the
question
of
concurrent
jurisdiction,
which
is
i
think
irrelevant
as
far
as
the
present
proceeding
is
concerned.
the
court
referred
our
motion
to
the
master,
and
that
was
argued
before
the
master
in
december
1971,
and
in
april
he
filed
his
report
making
a
recommendation.
that
recommendation
was
that
our
motion
to
amend
be
denied.
the
master’s
grounds
for
that
were
that
the
new
allegations
as
to
the
middle
of
the
river
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
he
also
said
that
even
if
we
did
state
a
cause
of
action,
our
--
any
relief
for
ohio
would
be
barred
by
this
court’s
opinions
in
the
series
of
cases
discussing
the
indiana-kentucky
borderline.
and
finally,
he
said
that
there
were
three
separate
cases
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
which
it
--
which
indicated
that
the
state
of
ohio
acquiesced
in
those
indiana-kentucky
cases.
our
position
is
that
the
new
allegations
that
we
had
made
alleging
that
the
boundary
line
does
lie
in
the
middle
of
the
river
clearly
state
a
cause
of
action.
we
also
contend
that
we
are
in
no
way
barred
by
this
court’s
decisions
and
the
indiana-kentucky
boundaries.
we
were
not
parties
to
that,
those
cases.
and
finally
that
we
--
the
three
particular
cases
that
the
master
picked
up
from
the
supreme
court
and
found
to
be
acquiescence
in
the
indiana-kentucky
line
of
cases,
do
not
so
hold,
and
that
we
are
--
that’s
the
only
thing
in
the
case
so
far
that
goes
to
the
point
of
acquiescence,
and
that
outside
of
that,
that
point
should
not
be
further
considered
at
the
present
time.
now,
i
really
have
nothing
much
to
add
to
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
in
the
brief.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir,
he
had
some
language
to
that
effect
in
his
--
in
his
reports.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no,
he
didn’t
cite
any
cases
to
my
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
yes.
that’s
right.
i’m
sorry,
you
are
correct.
michigan-wisconsin
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i
think
it
should.
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
if
we
were
--
i
would
agree
with
that.
if
we
were
sure
that
we
were
wrong
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i
don’t
know
where
he
got
that
except
from
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
kentucky.
the
only
thing
that
is
in
the
case
at
the
present
time
is
our
amended
complaint
and
that
says
nothing
about
acquiescence
one
way
or
the
other.
that’s
an
affirmative
defense
that
kentucky
has
to
raise.
so
far,
they
haven’t
even
had
the
chance
to
raise
it
because
this
court
has
not
granted
the
permission
to
us
to
file
a
complaint.
that
statement
is
without
any
support
in
the
record
at
all.
and
of
course
we
do
not
agree
to
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right;
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
facts.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
facts.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
rightl;
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
it
comes
from
one
of
the
kentucky’s
briefs.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well
he
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
he
can
take
judicial
notice,
that’s
right;
that’s
right.
but
of
course
our
position
is
that
he
misread
those
cases.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
they
were
not
talking
about
the
middle
of
the
river
at
all
or
anything
of
that
sort.
they
were
talking
only
about
the
margin
of
the
river
that
is
between
the
low
water
mark
and
the
bank.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right.
it
could
be
a
legal
one
if
there
were
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
--
for
instance
of
the
governor
or
the
legislature
of
the
state
which
actually
did
acquiesced
or
as,
as
in
the
indiana
cases,
there
was
a
contact
between
the
two
states.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well
it
would,
but
of
course
the
court
had
the
same
thing
in
the
submerged
lands
cases.
remember
the
california
case
was
the
first
one.
and
that
was
followed
up
by
the
two
from
louisiana
and
texas
in
which
the
contention
was
made
that
those
courts
were
bound
by
the
decision
made
in
california,
but
the
court
directed
full
hearings
on
it,
and
the
same
thing
is
before
the
court
right
now
in
the
continental
shelf
cases.
those
also
depend
on
the
original
california
submerged
land
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
it
would.
not
the
holding
of
the
case
but
the
dictum
in
the
case
would
have
to
be
overruled.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir,
because
the
reason
that
land
was
above
the
high
water
or
the
low
water
mark
anyway,
and
there
was
no
reason
for
the
court
saying
anything
about
the
middle
of
the
river.
he
could
have
decided
it
simply
by
saying
that
this
land
lies
between
the
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
and
the
indiana
bank.
consequently
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
sir;
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
that’s
the
reason
they
gave,
yes.
of
course,
our
position
is
that
chief
justice
marshall
was
a
virginian
of
course
and
nobody
raise
this
question
of
where
the
boundary
line
lay,
was
it
in
the
middle
of
the
river
or
the
north
shore,
so
he
didn’t
even
go
into
it.
later
on,
when
question
of
title
came
up
in
the
worcester
versus
georgia
case,
he
had
to
go
into
it
very
thoroughly.
and
what
he
said
there
is
in
direct
conflict
with
what
he
said
in
the
handly
case.
i
really
think
--
i
would
just
be
repeating
what
i
have
said
already
if
i
go
through,
because
the
questions
that
have
been
addressed
to
me
had
brought
out
the
main
argument
that
we
are
making.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
oh,
right.
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
sir.
may
i
say
just
--
make
just
a
couple
of
points
on
the
estoppel
and
acquiescence.
that
question
was
raised
in
the
united
states
versus
california,
the
first
tidelands
oil
case.
california
claimed
that
the
united
states
was
stopped
from
claiming
title
to
that
three-mile
belt
of
the
california
coast.
it
claimed
that
the
united
states
have
acquiesced
in
california’s
claims
of
title
for
years.
nevertheless,
the
court’s
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
black,
refused
to
accept
that
argument
and
discussed
it
at
some
length.
i
think
that
is
--
seems
to
me
to
be
controlling
in
this
particular
case.
the
other
point
is,
recently
there
have
been
a
number
of
bridges
constructed
between
ohio
and
kentucky.
they
were
the
subject
of
contracts
between
the
two
states.
the
contracts
provided
that
kentucky
would
pay
for
the
bridge
up
to
the
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
ohio
would
pay
for
the
rest
of
it.
that’s
on
the
ohio
side.
but,
the
contracts
also
provided
that
nothing
said
therein
should
be
determinative
of
where
the
boundary
line
lay.
that
shows
that
ohio
was
still
maintaining
its
position
that
the
boundary
line
was
not
at
the
low
water
mark.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i
think
some
of
them
were
written
prior
to
that
time
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
of
that.
i
know
some
of
them
have
been
written
after.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
1966.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
may
i
say
that
the
prior
administration
was
familiar
with
this
argument.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right.
they
were
familiar
with
this,
they
had
the
vinton
argument
made
to
the
general
court
of
kentucky
back
in
1848,
which
has
been
mentioned
right
at
the
end
of
our
brief
and
is
the
best
statement
of
ohio’s
position.
they
had
that
at
that
time.
they
didn’t
have
any
faith
in
it.
they
did
not
think
that
because
of
the
length
of
time
that
had
passed
that
they
would
be
able
to
prevail
on
this
court
to
permit
them
to
go
ahead
with
that
argument.
we
examined
it
and
we
take
a
different
view
of
it.
that’s
all.
it's
two
different
sets
of
lawyers
looking
at
it
and
deciding
what
should
be
presented
to
the
court.
but
i
think,
i
am
not
quite
sure
about
those
contracts
but
i
am
pretty
sure
that
there
were
some
of
them
that
were
written
before
1966.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
we
have
lined
up
all
the
documentary
evidence,
which
shows
to
me
conclusively
that
virginia
had
no
title
on
the
north
and
the
west
side
of
the
river.
consequently,
the
doctrine
that
chief
justice
marshall
laid
down
in
the
handly
case
did
not
apply
at
all.
he
said
that
if
one
state
owns
both
sides
of
the
river
and
gives
up
one
side,
it
retains
the
entire
river.
but
if
two
states
own
the
opposite
sides
of
the
river,
then
their
boundary
runs
to
the
middle.
now,
those
documentary
proofs,
what
happened
prior
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
show
that
virginia
regardless
of
what
their
original
claim
was,
under
the
charter
no
longer
had
any
title
on
the
north
and
west
side
of
the
river.
the
title
was
in
the
british
crown.
it
was
reserved
for
the
use
of
the
indians
and
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
upon
the
declaration
of
independence,
that
claim
passed
directly
to
the
united
states.
not
to
any
of
the
individual
states
at
all,
because
they
had
no
claim
to
it
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
which
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
your
honor,
those
acts
simply
mentioned
the
ohio
river
is
a
boundary.
they
say
no
more
than
that.
they
talk
about
the
lands
in
north
and
west
of
the
river
and
the
lands
in
south
and
east
of
it
and
that’s
all.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no;
no.
no
sir,
they
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well
let’s
go
back
at
the
time
of
the
revolution.
at
the
declaration
of
independence,
all
of
the
land
which
was
then
controlled
by
the
british
crown
and
which
was
outside
of
the
boundaries
of
the
states
passed
directly
to
the
united
states
under
the
external
sovereignty
rule
that
has
been
used
in
the
tidelands
oil
cases
and
is
now
being
argued
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
continental
shelf
case.
we
are
--
this
position
that
we
are
taking
here
is
the
same
as
the
position
that
he
is
taking
in
that
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
the
continental
congress
controlled
the
northwest
territory
right
from
the
start.
they
made
treaties
with
all
the
indians
who
were
at
that
time
leaving
and
had
occupancy
of
the
territory.
the
land
eventually
came
to
the
united
states
through
the
treaties
that
were
made
with
the
indians.
every
bit
of
ohio
is
covered
by
a
treaty
with
the
indians.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that
was
the
last
one,
the
latest
one.
they
were
a
lot
of
them
before
that.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
true,
but
there
was
also
a
southeast
territory,
which
was
the
land
lying
south
and
east
to
the
river,
tennessee
and
kentucky.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
and
if
you
look
through
the
early
acts
of
congress,
that’s
all
they
referred
to,
the
land
north
and
west
to
the
river
and
the
land
south
and
east
of
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
there
was
never,
never
any
attempt
to
draw
a
line
in
the
river.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
they
didn’t
have
anything
to
see.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right,
they
gave
up
their
claim.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
they
didn't
have
--
they
had
no
title,
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
sir;
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
by
the
state
of
ohio
requesting
a
determination
of
the
location
of
its
boundary
with
kentucky
in
the
ohio
river.
the
only
question
presently
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
ohio
shall
be
permitted
to
amend
its
original
complaint.
that
original
complaint
was
filed
back
in
1966.
at
that
time,
ohio
claimed
that
the
boundary
existed
at
the
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
of
the
river,
that
is
on
the
ohio
side,
as
it
stood
in
1792,
which
was
the
day
at
which
kentucky
became
a
state.
kentucky
filed
an
answer
and
it
claimed
that
the
boundary
lay
at
the
present
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
on
the
ohio
side.
that,
of
course,
was
much
farther
up
on
the
ohio
shore
than
the
old
1792
line,
because
of
the
new
dams
which
have
been
put
in
on
the
ohio
river
beginning
in
back
in
1890,
the
planning
began.
the
dams
were
erected.
i
think
the
first
set
of
them
were
completed
in
1925,
and
then
in
the
50’s
a
new
set
of
high
level
dams
began
to
be
erected
by
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
and
that
caused
a
much
higher
level
of
the
water
and
further
inundation
on
the
ohio
side.
well,
the
issues
were
joined
on
the
original
complaint
in
the
answer.
and
this
court
appointed
the
master
and
there
were
quite
a
number
of
conferences
between
the
master
and
counsel
as
to
how
the
case
should
be
conducted
and
the
evidence
presented.
there
were
a
great
number
of
conferences
apparently
between
counsels
on
both
sides
determining
just
what
the
evidence
would
be.
and
in
july
1970,
ohio
made
an
offer
of
settlement.
as
i
recall,
it
was
250
feet
up
into
the
river.
i
may
be
mistaken
on
the
exact
figures
on
that
but
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i
am
not
sure
your
honor
exactly
what.
i
would
guess
it
would
have
been
above
the
1792
line.
that’s
my
guess.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right;
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
i
have
not
gotten
into
that
part
of
it
yet
at
all,
and
i
can’t
say;
i’m
guessing
that
it
was
closer
to
what
ohio
wanted
than
what
kentucky
felt
ohio
should
get.
apparently,
from
what
i
can
gather
from
the
master’s
comments
and
from
what
i’ve
seen
in
the
file,
counsel
on
both
sides
felt
that
there
were
some
chance
that
this
would
be
accepted.
at
least
they
were
content.
nobody
could
tell
of
course
what
the
legislatures
or
the
executive
part
on
either
of
the
states
would
have
done.
so,
it
had
gone
just
that
far
that
the
offer
was
made.
unfortunately,
the
counsel
for
state
of
kentucky,
john
browning,
who
had
been
handling
the
case
since
the
very
outset
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
about
two
weeks
after
the
offer
was
made.
ultimately,
in
november
1970,
kentucky
simply
rejected
the
offer.
that
was
in
november.
a
little
over
a
month
later,
the
administration
in
ohio
changed.
a
new
attorney
general
came
in
and
he
asked
--
well,
nobody
in
was
left
on
the
staff
who
had
worked
on
this
case
at
all.
so
he
asked
that
a
complete
reexamination
of
the
file
and
everything
connected
with
it
be
made.
that
was
done
and
after
about
four
or
five
months
study,
recommendation
was
made
to
the
attorney
general
that
an
effort
be
made
to
ask
this
court
to
permit
an
amendment
of
the
complaint
in
order
to
permit
ohio
to
make
an
argument
that
it
was
entitled
to
a
line
in
the
middle
of
the
river.
we
didn’t
want
to
go
off
the
deep
end
on
this
without
checking
and
we
called
the
attorney
general’s
office
in
kentucky
and
asked
him
to
look
through
mr.
browning’s
files
and
see
whether
there
was
anything
that
would
make
it
clear
that
we
were
in
error,
that
we
couldn’t
possibly
prevail
on
that
argument.
well,
we
got
no
answer
from
that
call.
and
eventually
we
filed
the
motion
to
amend
the
complaint
which
is
pending
before
the
court
at
the
present
time.
that
was
done
in
august
1971.
and
what
we
did
was
to
add
the
first
count
of
the
complaint
that
is
alleging
that
the
real
boundary
between
the
two
states
lies
in
the
middle
of
the
river,
and
then
there
were
some
minor
alterations
in
the
further
parts
of
the
original
complaint
that
is,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
on
the
--
permitting
us
to
amend
the
or
to
--
or
if
the
master
were
to
find
against
us
on
the
middle
of
the
river,
then
we
would
still
argue
for
the
1792
line.
and
the
third
question
involved
is
the
question
of
concurrent
jurisdiction,
which
is
i
think
irrelevant
as
far
as
the
present
proceeding
is
concerned.
the
court
referred
our
motion
to
the
master,
and
that
was
argued
before
the
master
in
december
1971,
and
in
april
he
filed
his
report
making
a
recommendation.
that
recommendation
was
that
our
motion
to
amend
be
denied.
the
master’s
grounds
for
that
were
that
the
new
allegations
as
to
the
middle
of
the
river
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
he
also
said
that
even
if
we
did
state
a
cause
of
action,
our
--
any
relief
for
ohio
would
be
barred
by
this
court’s
opinions
in
the
series
of
cases
discussing
the
indiana-kentucky
borderline.
and
finally,
he
said
that
there
were
three
separate
cases
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
which
it
--
which
indicated
that
the
state
of
ohio
acquiesced
in
those
indiana-kentucky
cases.
our
position
is
that
the
new
allegations
that
we
had
made
alleging
that
the
boundary
line
does
lie
in
the
middle
of
the
river
clearly
state
a
cause
of
action.
we
also
contend
that
we
are
in
no
way
barred
by
this
court’s
decisions
and
the
indiana-kentucky
boundaries.
we
were
not
parties
to
that,
those
cases.
and
finally
that
we
--
the
three
particular
cases
that
the
master
picked
up
from
the
supreme
court
and
found
to
be
acquiescence
in
the
indiana-kentucky
line
of
cases,
do
not
so
hold,
and
that
we
are
--
that’s
the
only
thing
in
the
case
so
far
that
goes
to
the
point
of
acquiescence,
and
that
outside
of
that,
that
point
should
not
be
further
considered
at
the
present
time.
now,
i
really
have
nothing
much
to
add
to
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
in
the
brief.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir,
he
had
some
language
to
that
effect
in
his
--
in
his
reports.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no,
he
didn’t
cite
any
cases
to
my
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
yes.
that’s
right.
i’m
sorry,
you
are
correct.
michigan-wisconsin
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i
think
it
should.
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
if
we
were
--
i
would
agree
with
that.
if
we
were
sure
that
we
were
wrong
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i
don’t
know
where
he
got
that
except
from
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
kentucky.
the
only
thing
that
is
in
the
case
at
the
present
time
is
our
amended
complaint
and
that
says
nothing
about
acquiescence
one
way
or
the
other.
that’s
an
affirmative
defense
that
kentucky
has
to
raise.
so
far,
they
haven’t
even
had
the
chance
to
raise
it
because
this
court
has
not
granted
the
permission
to
us
to
file
a
complaint.
that
statement
is
without
any
support
in
the
record
at
all.
and
of
course
we
do
not
agree
to
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right;
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
facts.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
facts.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
rightl;
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
it
comes
from
one
of
the
kentucky’s
briefs.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well
he
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
he
can
take
judicial
notice,
that’s
right;
that’s
right.
but
of
course
our
position
is
that
he
misread
those
cases.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
they
were
not
talking
about
the
middle
of
the
river
at
all
or
anything
of
that
sort.
they
were
talking
only
about
the
margin
of
the
river
that
is
between
the
low
water
mark
and
the
bank.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right.
it
could
be
a
legal
one
if
there
were
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
--
for
instance
of
the
governor
or
the
legislature
of
the
state
which
actually
did
acquiesced
or
as,
as
in
the
indiana
cases,
there
was
a
contact
between
the
two
states.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well
it
would,
but
of
course
the
court
had
the
same
thing
in
the
submerged
lands
cases.
remember
the
california
case
was
the
first
one.
and
that
was
followed
up
by
the
two
from
louisiana
and
texas
in
which
the
contention
was
made
that
those
courts
were
bound
by
the
decision
made
in
california,
but
the
court
directed
full
hearings
on
it,
and
the
same
thing
is
before
the
court
right
now
in
the
continental
shelf
cases.
those
also
depend
on
the
original
california
submerged
land
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
it
would.
not
the
holding
of
the
case
but
the
dictum
in
the
case
would
have
to
be
overruled.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir,
because
the
reason
that
land
was
above
the
high
water
or
the
low
water
mark
anyway,
and
there
was
no
reason
for
the
court
saying
anything
about
the
middle
of
the
river.
he
could
have
decided
it
simply
by
saying
that
this
land
lies
between
the
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
and
the
indiana
bank.
consequently
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
sir;
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
that’s
the
reason
they
gave,
yes.
of
course,
our
position
is
that
chief
justice
marshall
was
a
virginian
of
course
and
nobody
raise
this
question
of
where
the
boundary
line
lay,
was
it
in
the
middle
of
the
river
or
the
north
shore,
so
he
didn’t
even
go
into
it.
later
on,
when
question
of
title
came
up
in
the
worcester
versus
georgia
case,
he
had
to
go
into
it
very
thoroughly.
and
what
he
said
there
is
in
direct
conflict
with
what
he
said
in
the
handly
case.
i
really
think
--
i
would
just
be
repeating
what
i
have
said
already
if
i
go
through,
because
the
questions
that
have
been
addressed
to
me
had
brought
out
the
main
argument
that
we
are
making.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
oh,
right.
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
sir.
may
i
say
just
--
make
just
a
couple
of
points
on
the
estoppel
and
acquiescence.
that
question
was
raised
in
the
united
states
versus
california,
the
first
tidelands
oil
case.
california
claimed
that
the
united
states
was
stopped
from
claiming
title
to
that
three-mile
belt
of
the
california
coast.
it
claimed
that
the
united
states
have
acquiesced
in
california’s
claims
of
title
for
years.
nevertheless,
the
court’s
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
black,
refused
to
accept
that
argument
and
discussed
it
at
some
length.
i
think
that
is
--
seems
to
me
to
be
controlling
in
this
particular
case.
the
other
point
is,
recently
there
have
been
a
number
of
bridges
constructed
between
ohio
and
kentucky.
they
were
the
subject
of
contracts
between
the
two
states.
the
contracts
provided
that
kentucky
would
pay
for
the
bridge
up
to
the
low
water
mark
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
ohio
would
pay
for
the
rest
of
it.
that’s
on
the
ohio
side.
but,
the
contracts
also
provided
that
nothing
said
therein
should
be
determinative
of
where
the
boundary
line
lay.
that
shows
that
ohio
was
still
maintaining
its
position
that
the
boundary
line
was
not
at
the
low
water
mark.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i
think
some
of
them
were
written
prior
to
that
time
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
of
that.
i
know
some
of
them
have
been
written
after.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
1966.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
may
i
say
that
the
prior
administration
was
familiar
with
this
argument.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right.
they
were
familiar
with
this,
they
had
the
vinton
argument
made
to
the
general
court
of
kentucky
back
in
1848,
which
has
been
mentioned
right
at
the
end
of
our
brief
and
is
the
best
statement
of
ohio’s
position.
they
had
that
at
that
time.
they
didn’t
have
any
faith
in
it.
they
did
not
think
that
because
of
the
length
of
time
that
had
passed
that
they
would
be
able
to
prevail
on
this
court
to
permit
them
to
go
ahead
with
that
argument.
we
examined
it
and
we
take
a
different
view
of
it.
that’s
all.
it's
two
different
sets
of
lawyers
looking
at
it
and
deciding
what
should
be
presented
to
the
court.
but
i
think,
i
am
not
quite
sure
about
those
contracts
but
i
am
pretty
sure
that
there
were
some
of
them
that
were
written
before
1966.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
we
have
lined
up
all
the
documentary
evidence,
which
shows
to
me
conclusively
that
virginia
had
no
title
on
the
north
and
the
west
side
of
the
river.
consequently,
the
doctrine
that
chief
justice
marshall
laid
down
in
the
handly
case
did
not
apply
at
all.
he
said
that
if
one
state
owns
both
sides
of
the
river
and
gives
up
one
side,
it
retains
the
entire
river.
but
if
two
states
own
the
opposite
sides
of
the
river,
then
their
boundary
runs
to
the
middle.
now,
those
documentary
proofs,
what
happened
prior
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
show
that
virginia
regardless
of
what
their
original
claim
was,
under
the
charter
no
longer
had
any
title
on
the
north
and
west
side
of
the
river.
the
title
was
in
the
british
crown.
it
was
reserved
for
the
use
of
the
indians
and
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
upon
the
declaration
of
independence,
that
claim
passed
directly
to
the
united
states.
not
to
any
of
the
individual
states
at
all,
because
they
had
no
claim
to
it
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
which
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
your
honor,
those
acts
simply
mentioned
the
ohio
river
is
a
boundary.
they
say
no
more
than
that.
they
talk
about
the
lands
in
north
and
west
of
the
river
and
the
lands
in
south
and
east
of
it
and
that’s
all.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no;
no.
no
sir,
they
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well
let’s
go
back
at
the
time
of
the
revolution.
at
the
declaration
of
independence,
all
of
the
land
which
was
then
controlled
by
the
british
crown
and
which
was
outside
of
the
boundaries
of
the
states
passed
directly
to
the
united
states
under
the
external
sovereignty
rule
that
has
been
used
in
the
tidelands
oil
cases
and
is
now
being
argued
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
continental
shelf
case.
we
are
--
this
position
that
we
are
taking
here
is
the
same
as
the
position
that
he
is
taking
in
that
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
the
continental
congress
controlled
the
northwest
territory
right
from
the
start.
they
made
treaties
with
all
the
indians
who
were
at
that
time
leaving
and
had
occupancy
of
the
territory.
the
land
eventually
came
to
the
united
states
through
the
treaties
that
were
made
with
the
indians.
every
bit
of
ohio
is
covered
by
a
treaty
with
the
indians.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that
was
the
last
one,
the
latest
one.
they
were
a
lot
of
them
before
that.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
true,
but
there
was
also
a
southeast
territory,
which
was
the
land
lying
south
and
east
to
the
river,
tennessee
and
kentucky.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
and
if
you
look
through
the
early
acts
of
congress,
that’s
all
they
referred
to,
the
land
north
and
west
to
the
river
and
the
land
south
and
east
of
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
there
was
never,
never
any
attempt
to
draw
a
line
in
the
river.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
they
didn’t
have
anything
to
see.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that’s
right,
they
gave
up
their
claim.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
they
didn't
have
--
they
had
no
title,
that’s
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
sir;
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
thank
you.
