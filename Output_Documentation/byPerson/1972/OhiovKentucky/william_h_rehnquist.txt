justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
mr.
howard
that
the
issue
of
acquiescence
over
a
period
of
150
is
basically
a
factual
one
that
you
would
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
want
to
call
witnesses
on
and
have
a
factual
determination
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
of
rather
than
just
a
legal
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
master
is
right
in
saying
that
this
court’s
decision
and
handly’s
lessee
although
not
res
judicata
as
to
ohio.
the
rational
requires
the
same
holding
as
to
the
ohio-kentucky
border,
then
that
would
be
a
legal
determination
quite
apart
from
any
acquiescence,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
really,
what
the
special
master
did
here
was
tantamount
to
allowing
a
motion
to
amend
the
complaint
and
dismissing
the
amended
complaint
for
failure
to
state
of
claim
for
relief,
wasn’t
it,
because
it
was
legally
barred?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
famularo,
to
take
justice
stewart’s
hypothetical
a
moment
ago,
in
a
common
law
of
court
where
you
file
a
complaint
that
doesn’t
state
a
claim
for
a
relief
as
an
amendment,
but
the
court
simply
denies
relief
to
file
it,
then
and
you
appeal,
and
on
appeal,
the
court
were
to
say,
well
he
should
have
been
given
leave
to
file
his
complaint,
but
we
see
that
it
doesn’t
state
any
state
of
claim
that
we
would
grant
relief
even
conceding
the
facts,
would
the
appellate
court
do
you
think
reverse
and
say,
even
though
it
would
have
done
in
no
good,
you
should
have
been
allowed
to
file
a
complaint
of
whether
to
affirm
on
other
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
supposing
we
can
judicially
notice
it.
does
it
amount
to
anything
to
more
than
saying
you
have
a
great
deal
of
evidence
which
would
clearly
be
submitted
--
admissible
in
support
of
your
view
as
opposed
to
being
conclusive
on
ohio?
