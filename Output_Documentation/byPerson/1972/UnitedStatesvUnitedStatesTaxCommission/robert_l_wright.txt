mr.
robert
l.
wright
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
going
to
first
describe
to
you
the
mississippi
policy
toward
military
sales
of
liquor
and
then
describe
the
federal
policy
toward
those
sales
and
finally
discuss
this
court’s
decisions
that
accommodate
state
and
federal
liquor
control
policies
with
each
other.
now
mississippi’s
policy
is
as
has
been
pointed
out
to
preempt
for
itself
all
profits
made
from
the
wholesale
distribution
of
distilled
spirits
and
wine
within
its
own
borders.
now
mississippi
also
imposes
an
annual
privilege
tax
of
$900
on
package
retailers
and
excises
taxes
on
all
sales,
varying
from
35
cents
a
gallon
on
wine
to
two-and-a-half
dollars
a
gallon
on
distilled
spirits.
now,
the
states
give,
the
state
gives
to
the
military
retailers,
these
are
the
clubs
and
by
the
way
those
are
all
stipulated
to
be
non-appropriated
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
question
about
either
fact
that
they
operate
in
non-appropriated
funds
and
that
they
are
instrumentalities
of
the
government.
now,
the
state
gives
to
those
military
retailers,
the
option
of
ordering
direct
from
the
distillers
without
payment
of
any
state
taxes,
providing
only
that
the
state's
wholesale
markup
is
collected
and
remitted
to
the
state
by
the
distiller.
now,
the
markup
districts
administratively
by
the
commission
in
accordance
with
the
statuary
direction
to
cover
the
cost
of
operation
of
a
state's
wholesale
liquor
business,
yield
a
reason
of
a
profit,
and
be
competitive
with
liquor
prices
in
neighboring
states.
during
the
period
here
involved,
that
markup
by
the
spirits
was
17%
to
22%
on
wine.
now
that
markup
was
applied
uniformly
throughout
the
state,
selling
to
all
retailers
in
the
state,
and
the
effect
of
the
military
tax
exemption,
however,
was
to
give
the
military
retailers
a
price
on
whiskey
and
gin
that
was
50
cents
cheaper
than
the
private
retailers
pay,
because
the
excise
tax
exemption
amounts
to
two-and-half
dollars
a
gallon
on
spirits.
the
military
retailers
were
also
exempted
from
the
$900
a
year
privilege
tax
not
paid
by
the
private
retailers.
now
the
net
effect
of
the
state's
regulation
is
that
the
military
clubs
are
guaranteed
a
price
on
the
distilled
spirits
that
is
no
more
than
17%
above
the
price
at
which
distilled
spirits
are
sold
in
the
state.
this
17%
markup,
that's
state's
gross
profit
margin,
that
their
income
to
the
state
from
the
market
is
the
difference
between
the
markup
and
what
it
costs
the
state
to
maintain
its
wholesale
distribution
system.
now
that
cost
is
substantial
because
it
involves
stocking
and
warehousing,
a
very
large
inventory
of
wine
and
spirits
statewide.
now
the
cost
to
this,
carry
that
inventory,
has
to
borne
by
the
state,
whether
the
military
chooses
to
buy
direct
from
it
or
direct
from
suppliers
and
in
accordance
for
the
options
given
to
the
military
for
their
convenience.
now
when
military
orders
are
sent
direct
to
the
suppliers,
he
supplies,
of
course,
to
perform
the
wholesaling
functions
that
the
state
normally
performs,
and
to
remit
the
state's
normal
wholesale
market
to
the
state.
the
application
of
the
state's
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
indeed,
it
could
and
this
option
was
granted
to
the
retailers
for
their
benefit,
for
their
convenience?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
we
had
cited
the
yosemite,
the
collins
against
yosemite
park
case,
which
held
exactly
that
as
far
as
california’s
excise
tax
is
concerned,
but
i
will
get
to
that
case
later
on,
i
want
to
describe
here
first
how
the
mississippi
system
operates
and
then
i
will
describe
how
the
federal
policy
operates,
because
after
you
see
how
the
federal
system
and
state
system
perform,
i
don’t
think
you
will
find
any
conflict
that
would
force
you
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
now,
when
the
military
orders
are
sent
direct
to
the
suppler,
he
has
to
perform
those
wholesaling
functions,
but
the
state,
the
military
clubs,
the
united
states
never
performs
these
wholesaling
functions,
whether
it
buys
direct
from
the
distiller
or
whether
it
buys
--
whether
it
chose
to
buy
from
the
state,
in
neither
event,
would
the
united
states
or
the
clubs,
perform
the
wholesaling
functions
for
which
markup
is
charged.
now
the
application
of
this
markup
to
direct
sales
prevents
the
distiller
from
adding
more
than
17%
to
his
wholesale
price
when
he
sales
to
military
retailers.
that's
the
same
ceiling
that
applies,
of
course,
to
the
sales
that
are
made
by
the
state
to
the
retailers
because
of
the
fixed
17%
markup.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no,
what
they
get
is
the
privilege
of
selling
liquor
in
mississippi.
they
gain
access
to
the
mississippi
market
that
they
could
not
have
they
did
not
comply
with
mississippi
law.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
gives
the
distiller
two
things.
it
gives
him
the
right
to
distribute
his
liquor
in
mississippi
and
it
also
gives
him
a
tax
free
military
market
that
can
be
exploited
without
payment
and
save
taxes
that
attach
to
the
sales
through
the
private
store.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
am
pointing
out
that
the
17%
is
a
gross
profit
margin
that
in
itself
is
that
--
the
profit
of
the
state
gets,
a
difference
between
the
17%
markup.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
not
with
the
physical
liquor.
they
of
course
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
have
to
give,
they
don't
keep
track
of
it
and
they
do
not
get
the
money
from
the
military.
there
is
no
payment
made
by
the
military.
these
protests
that
were
talked
about
are
not
protests
made
by
the
suppliers,
who
are
actually
assessed
the
charge
and
then
pay
it.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
those
are
protests
made
by
the
clubs
to
the
suppliers.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
precisely.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yeah
exactly.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well
it
isn't
--
i
am
pointing
out
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
tax.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it’s
a
wholesale
markup.
now
no
distiller
has
protested
this
obligation,
which
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well
it
costs
--
it
is
a
possible
arrangement
for
him,
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
burden
is
his,
it
is
imposed
on
him,
the
markup
obligation.
he
is
the
one
who
discharges
it.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
and
that
there
is
no
more
of
a
burden
on
the
clubs
than
any
other
state
excise
tax
or
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
was
no
compulsion
on
the
seller
not
to
comply
with
mississippi’s
law,
there
is.
he'd
be
prosecuted
criminally
if
he
didn't.
there
is
a
no
doubt
about
that,
but
the
regulation
operates
on
him.
if
the
distillers
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
the
tax
apply
to
--
the
tax
on
liquor.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
there
may
be
one,
i
don’t
think
it's
significant
in
this
context.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no
it's
not
all
state
taxes
are
exempted,
the
military
clubs
are
exempted
from
all
state
taxes,
that's
the
same
sentence
in
the
regulation
that
imposes
the
market
exempts
from
all
state
taxes.
but
now,
any
distiller,
even
a
private
one,
knows
it,
none
of
his
wholesale,
if
he
has
an
exclusive
wholesale
distributor,
whether
he
is
public
or
private,
the
wholesale
distributor
can't
be
expected
to
tolerate
direct
sales
that
made
by
the
manufacturer
that
under
cut
his
profit,
collecting
and
remitting
a
wholesaler's
or
an
exclusive
wholesaler's
markup
to
him
on
direct
sales
made
for
the
convenience
of
a
purchaser
is
common
industry
practice.
now
at
the
trial
no
effort
was
made
by
the
united
states
to
show
that
after
mississippi's
regulations,
any
of
the
effected
military
clubs
could
have
bought
liquor
from
any
supplier
at
a
lower
price
than
they
actually
pay.
from
the
nature
of
the
regulation,
i
think
you
could
see
that
no
such
choise
was
possible,
unless
you
assume
that
some
supplier
wanted
to
penetrate
the
military
market
could
validly
offer
special
inducements
that
would
have
fit
to
only
principles
of
full
state
and
federal
regulation
of
the
liquor
traffic.
now
coming
to
the
federal
regulation,
federal
liquor
control
policy,
unlike
mississippi,
is
centered
around
practices
and
have
no
special
bearing
on
activities
within
any
state.
however,
in
some
aspects
federal
control
is
more
decisive
than
state
control
when
it
comes
to
price,
for
example.
the
major
part
of
an
average
cost,
the
average
price
of
distilled
spirits.
so
anywhere
in
united
states
is
a
federal
excise
tax,
that's
$10.50
on
every
gallon
100
spirits.
these
mean
that
roughly
half
of
the
wholesale
price
even
the
best
by
the
government
as
federal
excise
tax.
now
if
the
congress
thought
as
the
convention
that's
made
here
that
making
some
military
raft
requires
low
liquor
prices,
it
could
cut
the
club
prices
in
to
half
by
simply
providing
the
federal
excise
tax
refund
to
military
persons.
now,
the
congress
has
been
asked
by
the
defense
department
to
solve
its
moral
problems
that
way.
the
only
federal
legislation
now
on
the
books
dealing
with
military
liquor
is
the
1951
law
that's
afforded
in
the
appendix
here
in
full,
and
that
statute
is
--
it
says
that
two
cents
is
the
sole
authority
of
the
defense
department
of
regulations
that
put
the
military
in
the
business
of
selling
liquor
at
retail.
those
are
also
set
out
full
in
the
appendix.
now
what
this
does
on
its
face,
i
am
talking
about
the
1951
federal
act
is
authorized
the
defense
department
to
make
regulations
governing
sales
to
or
buy
members
of
the
arm
forces
at
or
there
any
military
base,
any
base.
it
doesn't
have
any
distinction
between
exclusive
and
other
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
really
don’t
know,
i
assume
they
probably
might
have
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
assert
nothing
as
to
cigarettes.
the
only
association
here
is
to
liquor,
because
this
is
a
twenty-first
amendment
case,
and
twenty-first
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
cigarettes.
it
may
will
be
that
mississippi
could
not
do
with
respect
to
cigarettes
what
it
has
done
with
respect
to
liquor.
now
what
it
has
done
with
respect
to
liquor
is
well
within
the
rights
granted
by
that
amendment
to
control
the
distribution
of
liquor
in
mississippi.
now
the
statute
i
just
referred
to
were
--
also
makes
these
regulations
that
the
secretary
of
the
defense
can
follow
here
punishable
with
federal
crime.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
couldn't
say,
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it's
possible.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
the
state
has
--
i
think
the
state's
power
to
regulate
staffs
of
the
border
of
the
end
play
that
any
of
them
as
far
as
what
happens
on
the
base.
the
federal
government
controls
what
happens,
not
the
state,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
cost
of
liquor
that
goes
into
the
base.
it
is
to
that
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question,
but
what
--
the
stores
operated
on
the
base
are
at
no
better
position
to
resist
mississippi’s
control
than
the
private
stores
and
this
--
the
entire
--
returning
to
the
statute,
this
is
the
only
federal
law
on
this
particular
question
of
liquor
sales
at
bases.
the
law's
entire
legislative
history
is
found
on
one
page
of
congressional
record
stated
in
our
brief.
now
that
was
adopted
as
an
amendment
to
the
extension
act
of
1951
by
agreement
just
before
the
house
passed
it.
that
amendment
was
proposed
by
representative
cole
of
new
york
as
a
substitute
for
one
proposed
by
representative
price
from
south
carolina.
the
price's
amendment
would
have
made
every
base
where
draftees
were
trained
bone
dry.
cole
said
his
amendment
was
preferable,
because
there
would
not
be
regulations
made
by
the
secretary
apply
to
all
bases.
price's
said
that
--
it
was
agreeable
to
him,
cole's
amendment
was
adapted
without
any
debate
without
the
quote.
now
you
should
also
remember
that
three
years
before
the
federal
assimilative
crimes
act
had
been
enacted
in
1948,
which
made
state
crimes
punishable
as
federal
crimes
when
committed
inside
federal
enclaves
where
there
is
exclusive
or
concurrent
jurisdiction,
and
subsequently
all
state
liquor
laws
were
then
as
they
are
now
enforceable
by
criminal
prosecution.
now
no
mention
of
those
laws
was
made
by
cole
or
by
price
or
anyone
else
when
this
1951
federal
regulations
was
passed.
now
whatever
else
congress
may
have
had
to
do
by
that
51
law,
it
certainly
didn't
intend
to
make
military
bases
payments
for
bootleggers.
now
here
is
the
term
bootlegger,
because
since
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that's
word
that
describes
the
activities
of
people
who
sell
liquor
without
payment
of
taxes
etcetera.
now
the
defense
department
itself
construed
this
law
that
i
just
described
as
not
requiring
avoidance
of
state
regulations
of
sales
to
military
bases.
when
it
amended
its
own
regulations
in
june
1966,
that
was
just
before
mississippi’s
regulation
became
effective,
the
federal
amendment
struck
out
the
requirement
that
the
base
purchases
be
made
“without
regard
to
prices
locally
established
by
state
statutes
or
otherwise”.
it
continued
to
enforce
its
requirement
that
its
own
sales
of
packaged
liquor
be
priced
“within
10%
of
the
lowest
prevailing
rates
of
civilian
outlets
in
the
area".
now,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
on
the
face
of
the
regulations
themselves
and
the
statutes,
there
is
no
genuine
conflict
between
federal
and
mississippi
liquor
control
policies
as
they
are
expressed
in
their
respective
laws
and
regulations
in
those
policies
in
both
cases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
in
theory,
but
not
in
fact.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
in
law
it
was
a
dry
state.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that
i
can't
tell
you,
but
the
stipulation
doesn't
cover
the
pre
1966
activities.
i
would
suspect
that
was
being
freely
sold
in
country
clubs.
i
would
suspect
the
military
clubs
also
bought
it
and
sold
it,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
this
is
simply
not
part
of
the
record
that
you
have
here.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well
they
are
all
federal
enclaves.
the
difference
is
--
between
them
is
the
two
--
they
claim
that
the
grant
was
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
other
two
concurrent,
but
in
either
events
you
understand
these
cessions
of
the
basis
were
made
from
42
to
50,
this
is
while
mississippi
was
dry,
and
after
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
passed
mississippi's
right
to
regulate
to
tax
or
establish
a
markup
or
do
anything
else
with
respect
to
controlling
liquor
in
mississippi
stems
from
the
twenty-first
amendment
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
--
which
annotated
the
cessions.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
right,
and
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
can't
tell
you
but
i
would
suspect
that
there
was
liquor
on
the
bases
as
there
was
nearly
everywhere
else
in
mississippi
on
merely
the
bases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
think
its
more
identical
question
than
the
one
we
have
here
because
i
think
it's
clear
that
when
you
have
a
state
trying
to
control
what
happens
on
the
base,
conduct
on
the
base,
you
have
entirely
different
question
than
you
do
when
all
state
wants
to
do
is
to
control
the
distribution
of
liquor
to
the
base,
which
is
what
you
have
in
the
case
here,
and
then
this
was
also
involved
in
the
yosemite
case,
but
this
brings
me
to
what
i
take
are
the
two
decisive
cases
of
this
court
in
this
area.
assuming
that
you
do
believe
there
is
a
conflict
between
federal
and
state
policy,
which
i
don't
think
can
really
be
found
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
never
did
require
them
to
seek
the
lowest
price.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
this
suit
clears
the
conflict
unquestionably.
i
am
talking
about
if
you
lay
the
federal
policy
side
by
side
with
the
state
policy
as
expressed
in
the
laws
and
regulations
that
were
applied
to
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
even
if
you
regard
it
a
conflict
as
present,
i
think
your
decisions,
the
court’s
decision
in
ohio
against
helvering
and
in
collins
against
yosemite
park
decides
this
case
in
favor
of
mississippi.
now
in
1934
ohio’s
attorney
general
thought
the
moral
of
ohio
citizens
would
be
a
proof
if
they
went
to
federal
excise
tax
is
--
liquor
sales
could
be
avoided.
now,
following
the
twenty-first
amendment,
ohio
preempted
for
itself
didn't
it
suppose
to
selling,
wholesaling
liquor
within
the
state.
now,
ohio
argued
that
since
it
had
gone
into
the
liquor
business
itself
there
is
both
the
control
over
revenue
and
measure.
the
sale
of
liquor
in
ohio
was
a
sovereign
function
that
could
not
be
impaired
by
federal
action,
and
they
claim
that
the
federal
excise
tax
was
such
an
unconstitutional
impairment,
because
it
did
enormously
increase
the
prices
that
the
state
had
to
pay
for
the
liquor
itself.
now
this
court
as
far
as
to
ohio's
argument
was
refusal
to
allow
ohio's
point.
the
opinion
simply
observed
that
while
ohio
could
enter
the
liquor
business
with
a
state
monopoly,
it
could
only
do
so
subject
to
normal
non-discriminatory
business
taxation
and
all
you
have
here
is
normal
imposition
of
a
markup,
which
is
discriminatory
only
inside
of
the
clubs,
because
when
we
markup
does
apply
to
military
service,
all
taxes
are
away,
but
when
applied
to
the
private
clubs,
the
excise
tax
has
to
be
paid
which
gives
them
a
much
higher
per
case
price.
now
four
year
later
in
the
yosemite
park
case,
a
liquor
selling
concession
here
at
the
park
service
tried
to
avoid
the
payment
of
the
california
excise
tax
on
his
liquor
sales
and
couldn't
do
it.
now,
he
argued
that
he
was
the
an
agent
of
the
federal
government,
operating
in
an
enclave
where
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
now
this
court
held
that
that
the
concession
area
that
they
have
take
out
a
retailer's
permit
or
pay
california's
tax
on
retailers,
and
mississippi
is
not
attempting
to
force
these
clubs
either
to
take
out
retailer's
permit
or
pay
that
retailer's
tax.
the
court
also
held,
however,
that
the
yosemite
park
in
cession
did
have
to
pay
california’s
excise
tax,
levied
on
all
liquor
sold
“within
the
state”,
because
within
the
state
meant
anywhere
within
the
state’s
boundaries
whether
on
a
federal
enclave
or
elsewhere.
now
the
court
noted
that
california
reserved
taxing
power
when
the
park
was
conceded
to
the
government
in
1990,
but
that
doesn’t
explain
the,
sticks
to
truth,
between
the
retailer's
tax
and
the
excise
tax.
now,
california
has
treated
that
1938
decision
as
authorizing
application
of
its
excise
tax
to
all
liquor
sales
to
military
bases
within
the
state,
and
the
united
states
has
never
challenged
that
construction.
now,
california
gives
liquor
wholesalers
no
excise
tax
exemption
on
sales
made
to
non-appropriated
fund
agencies
selling
liquor
on
military
bases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
i
think
he
clearly
wasn't
an
agent
of
the
park
service.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no,
i
think
clearly
if
there
is
a
constitutional
prohibition
against
california’s
taxing
sales
of
liquor
into
a
federal
enclave,
then
nothing
california
could
do
by
its
statutes
where
they
give
it
the
right
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
think
it
was
held
as
to
that
conservration
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
they
could.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
in
that
case
it
did,
yes.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
since
that
time,
california
has
enacted
legislation
which
applies
its
tax
not
only
to
sales
to
non-appropriated
fund
instrumentalities,
at
all
the
bases
in
the
state
and
without
regard
to
the
charge
of
cession
or
without
regard
to
what
taxing
rights,
if
anyway
they
were
reserved
on
the
cases
were
ceded,
and
that
california
also
gives
no
excise
tax
exemption
to
distillers
outside
the
state
who
sell
direct
to
military
installations
where
payment
is
made
out
of
the
federal
treasury
and
the
us
has
never
attacked
california’s
right
to
do
that.
now,
in
1947,
a
distiller
did
litigate
the
matter
however.
national
distillers
tried
to
avoid
payment
of
the
tax
on
the
sale
of
41000
(inaudible)
whiskey
(inaudible)
for
distill
purposes
and
sent
to
army
medical
depot
in
los
angeles.
now
that
whiskey
was
ordered
out
of
the
st.
louis
and
shipped
to
los
angeles
from
ohio
and
the
distiller
argued
that
the
application
of
the
california
excise
tax
to
that
shipment
creates
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
federal
functions,
because
the
tax
was
included
in
the
price
the
army
paid.
now,
the
california
appellate
court
rejected
the
distiller’s
argument
and
sustained
the
tax.
that
case
is
cited
on
the
page
17
of
our
brief
in
footnote
12.
now,
the
us
could
have
intervened
in
that
case
and
carried
it
to
this
court
on
the
constitutional
issue,
but
it
didn't.
what
it's
doing
now,
is
asking
you
to
overturn
a
construction
of
that
1938
decision
in
yosemite
park
that
was
regarded
as
settled
until
this
case
was
brought
against
mississippi.
now,
if
there
is
only
solid
policy
reason
for
doing
that,
i
haven't
heard
of
expressed
into
government's
argument,
haven't
seen
in
its
brief.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
your
honor,
i
give
you
this
one
citation
that
i
thought
it
was
my
last
point.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
all
i
have
is
this
should
have
been
included
in
my
belief,
it's
a
senate
report
on
the
buck
act,
which
was
passed
in
1940.
you
will
simply
look
at
the
report,
the
finance
committee
senate
report,
1625,
76th
congress,
may
16,
1940,
you
will
see
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
defense
was
removed
entirely
insofar
as
the
sales
and
used
taxes
on
the
general
merchandise.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
going
to
first
describe
to
you
the
mississippi
policy
toward
military
sales
of
liquor
and
then
describe
the
federal
policy
toward
those
sales
and
finally
discuss
this
court’s
decisions
that
accommodate
state
and
federal
liquor
control
policies
with
each
other.
now
mississippi’s
policy
is
as
has
been
pointed
out
to
preempt
for
itself
all
profits
made
from
the
wholesale
distribution
of
distilled
spirits
and
wine
within
its
own
borders.
now
mississippi
also
imposes
an
annual
privilege
tax
of
$900
on
package
retailers
and
excises
taxes
on
all
sales,
varying
from
35
cents
a
gallon
on
wine
to
two-and-a-half
dollars
a
gallon
on
distilled
spirits.
now,
the
states
give,
the
state
gives
to
the
military
retailers,
these
are
the
clubs
and
by
the
way
those
are
all
stipulated
to
be
non-appropriated
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
question
about
either
fact
that
they
operate
in
non-appropriated
funds
and
that
they
are
instrumentalities
of
the
government.
now,
the
state
gives
to
those
military
retailers,
the
option
of
ordering
direct
from
the
distillers
without
payment
of
any
state
taxes,
providing
only
that
the
state's
wholesale
markup
is
collected
and
remitted
to
the
state
by
the
distiller.
now,
the
markup
districts
administratively
by
the
commission
in
accordance
with
the
statuary
direction
to
cover
the
cost
of
operation
of
a
state's
wholesale
liquor
business,
yield
a
reason
of
a
profit,
and
be
competitive
with
liquor
prices
in
neighboring
states.
during
the
period
here
involved,
that
markup
by
the
spirits
was
17%
to
22%
on
wine.
now
that
markup
was
applied
uniformly
throughout
the
state,
selling
to
all
retailers
in
the
state,
and
the
effect
of
the
military
tax
exemption,
however,
was
to
give
the
military
retailers
a
price
on
whiskey
and
gin
that
was
50
cents
cheaper
than
the
private
retailers
pay,
because
the
excise
tax
exemption
amounts
to
two-and-half
dollars
a
gallon
on
spirits.
the
military
retailers
were
also
exempted
from
the
$900
a
year
privilege
tax
not
paid
by
the
private
retailers.
now
the
net
effect
of
the
state's
regulation
is
that
the
military
clubs
are
guaranteed
a
price
on
the
distilled
spirits
that
is
no
more
than
17%
above
the
price
at
which
distilled
spirits
are
sold
in
the
state.
this
17%
markup,
that's
state's
gross
profit
margin,
that
their
income
to
the
state
from
the
market
is
the
difference
between
the
markup
and
what
it
costs
the
state
to
maintain
its
wholesale
distribution
system.
now
that
cost
is
substantial
because
it
involves
stocking
and
warehousing,
a
very
large
inventory
of
wine
and
spirits
statewide.
now
the
cost
to
this,
carry
that
inventory,
has
to
borne
by
the
state,
whether
the
military
chooses
to
buy
direct
from
it
or
direct
from
suppliers
and
in
accordance
for
the
options
given
to
the
military
for
their
convenience.
now
when
military
orders
are
sent
direct
to
the
suppliers,
he
supplies,
of
course,
to
perform
the
wholesaling
functions
that
the
state
normally
performs,
and
to
remit
the
state's
normal
wholesale
market
to
the
state.
the
application
of
the
state's
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
indeed,
it
could
and
this
option
was
granted
to
the
retailers
for
their
benefit,
for
their
convenience?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
we
had
cited
the
yosemite,
the
collins
against
yosemite
park
case,
which
held
exactly
that
as
far
as
california’s
excise
tax
is
concerned,
but
i
will
get
to
that
case
later
on,
i
want
to
describe
here
first
how
the
mississippi
system
operates
and
then
i
will
describe
how
the
federal
policy
operates,
because
after
you
see
how
the
federal
system
and
state
system
perform,
i
don’t
think
you
will
find
any
conflict
that
would
force
you
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
now,
when
the
military
orders
are
sent
direct
to
the
suppler,
he
has
to
perform
those
wholesaling
functions,
but
the
state,
the
military
clubs,
the
united
states
never
performs
these
wholesaling
functions,
whether
it
buys
direct
from
the
distiller
or
whether
it
buys
--
whether
it
chose
to
buy
from
the
state,
in
neither
event,
would
the
united
states
or
the
clubs,
perform
the
wholesaling
functions
for
which
markup
is
charged.
now
the
application
of
this
markup
to
direct
sales
prevents
the
distiller
from
adding
more
than
17%
to
his
wholesale
price
when
he
sales
to
military
retailers.
that's
the
same
ceiling
that
applies,
of
course,
to
the
sales
that
are
made
by
the
state
to
the
retailers
because
of
the
fixed
17%
markup.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no,
what
they
get
is
the
privilege
of
selling
liquor
in
mississippi.
they
gain
access
to
the
mississippi
market
that
they
could
not
have
they
did
not
comply
with
mississippi
law.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
gives
the
distiller
two
things.
it
gives
him
the
right
to
distribute
his
liquor
in
mississippi
and
it
also
gives
him
a
tax
free
military
market
that
can
be
exploited
without
payment
and
save
taxes
that
attach
to
the
sales
through
the
private
store.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
am
pointing
out
that
the
17%
is
a
gross
profit
margin
that
in
itself
is
that
--
the
profit
of
the
state
gets,
a
difference
between
the
17%
markup.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
not
with
the
physical
liquor.
they
of
course
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
have
to
give,
they
don't
keep
track
of
it
and
they
do
not
get
the
money
from
the
military.
there
is
no
payment
made
by
the
military.
these
protests
that
were
talked
about
are
not
protests
made
by
the
suppliers,
who
are
actually
assessed
the
charge
and
then
pay
it.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
those
are
protests
made
by
the
clubs
to
the
suppliers.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
precisely.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yeah
exactly.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well
it
isn't
--
i
am
pointing
out
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
tax.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it’s
a
wholesale
markup.
now
no
distiller
has
protested
this
obligation,
which
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well
it
costs
--
it
is
a
possible
arrangement
for
him,
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
burden
is
his,
it
is
imposed
on
him,
the
markup
obligation.
he
is
the
one
who
discharges
it.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
and
that
there
is
no
more
of
a
burden
on
the
clubs
than
any
other
state
excise
tax
or
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
was
no
compulsion
on
the
seller
not
to
comply
with
mississippi’s
law,
there
is.
he'd
be
prosecuted
criminally
if
he
didn't.
there
is
a
no
doubt
about
that,
but
the
regulation
operates
on
him.
if
the
distillers
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
the
tax
apply
to
--
the
tax
on
liquor.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
there
may
be
one,
i
don’t
think
it's
significant
in
this
context.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no
it's
not
all
state
taxes
are
exempted,
the
military
clubs
are
exempted
from
all
state
taxes,
that's
the
same
sentence
in
the
regulation
that
imposes
the
market
exempts
from
all
state
taxes.
but
now,
any
distiller,
even
a
private
one,
knows
it,
none
of
his
wholesale,
if
he
has
an
exclusive
wholesale
distributor,
whether
he
is
public
or
private,
the
wholesale
distributor
can't
be
expected
to
tolerate
direct
sales
that
made
by
the
manufacturer
that
under
cut
his
profit,
collecting
and
remitting
a
wholesaler's
or
an
exclusive
wholesaler's
markup
to
him
on
direct
sales
made
for
the
convenience
of
a
purchaser
is
common
industry
practice.
now
at
the
trial
no
effort
was
made
by
the
united
states
to
show
that
after
mississippi's
regulations,
any
of
the
effected
military
clubs
could
have
bought
liquor
from
any
supplier
at
a
lower
price
than
they
actually
pay.
from
the
nature
of
the
regulation,
i
think
you
could
see
that
no
such
choise
was
possible,
unless
you
assume
that
some
supplier
wanted
to
penetrate
the
military
market
could
validly
offer
special
inducements
that
would
have
fit
to
only
principles
of
full
state
and
federal
regulation
of
the
liquor
traffic.
now
coming
to
the
federal
regulation,
federal
liquor
control
policy,
unlike
mississippi,
is
centered
around
practices
and
have
no
special
bearing
on
activities
within
any
state.
however,
in
some
aspects
federal
control
is
more
decisive
than
state
control
when
it
comes
to
price,
for
example.
the
major
part
of
an
average
cost,
the
average
price
of
distilled
spirits.
so
anywhere
in
united
states
is
a
federal
excise
tax,
that's
$10.50
on
every
gallon
100
spirits.
these
mean
that
roughly
half
of
the
wholesale
price
even
the
best
by
the
government
as
federal
excise
tax.
now
if
the
congress
thought
as
the
convention
that's
made
here
that
making
some
military
raft
requires
low
liquor
prices,
it
could
cut
the
club
prices
in
to
half
by
simply
providing
the
federal
excise
tax
refund
to
military
persons.
now,
the
congress
has
been
asked
by
the
defense
department
to
solve
its
moral
problems
that
way.
the
only
federal
legislation
now
on
the
books
dealing
with
military
liquor
is
the
1951
law
that's
afforded
in
the
appendix
here
in
full,
and
that
statute
is
--
it
says
that
two
cents
is
the
sole
authority
of
the
defense
department
of
regulations
that
put
the
military
in
the
business
of
selling
liquor
at
retail.
those
are
also
set
out
full
in
the
appendix.
now
what
this
does
on
its
face,
i
am
talking
about
the
1951
federal
act
is
authorized
the
defense
department
to
make
regulations
governing
sales
to
or
buy
members
of
the
arm
forces
at
or
there
any
military
base,
any
base.
it
doesn't
have
any
distinction
between
exclusive
and
other
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
really
don’t
know,
i
assume
they
probably
might
have
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
assert
nothing
as
to
cigarettes.
the
only
association
here
is
to
liquor,
because
this
is
a
twenty-first
amendment
case,
and
twenty-first
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
cigarettes.
it
may
will
be
that
mississippi
could
not
do
with
respect
to
cigarettes
what
it
has
done
with
respect
to
liquor.
now
what
it
has
done
with
respect
to
liquor
is
well
within
the
rights
granted
by
that
amendment
to
control
the
distribution
of
liquor
in
mississippi.
now
the
statute
i
just
referred
to
were
--
also
makes
these
regulations
that
the
secretary
of
the
defense
can
follow
here
punishable
with
federal
crime.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
couldn't
say,
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it's
possible.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
the
state
has
--
i
think
the
state's
power
to
regulate
staffs
of
the
border
of
the
end
play
that
any
of
them
as
far
as
what
happens
on
the
base.
the
federal
government
controls
what
happens,
not
the
state,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
cost
of
liquor
that
goes
into
the
base.
it
is
to
that
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question,
but
what
--
the
stores
operated
on
the
base
are
at
no
better
position
to
resist
mississippi’s
control
than
the
private
stores
and
this
--
the
entire
--
returning
to
the
statute,
this
is
the
only
federal
law
on
this
particular
question
of
liquor
sales
at
bases.
the
law's
entire
legislative
history
is
found
on
one
page
of
congressional
record
stated
in
our
brief.
now
that
was
adopted
as
an
amendment
to
the
extension
act
of
1951
by
agreement
just
before
the
house
passed
it.
that
amendment
was
proposed
by
representative
cole
of
new
york
as
a
substitute
for
one
proposed
by
representative
price
from
south
carolina.
the
price's
amendment
would
have
made
every
base
where
draftees
were
trained
bone
dry.
cole
said
his
amendment
was
preferable,
because
there
would
not
be
regulations
made
by
the
secretary
apply
to
all
bases.
price's
said
that
--
it
was
agreeable
to
him,
cole's
amendment
was
adapted
without
any
debate
without
the
quote.
now
you
should
also
remember
that
three
years
before
the
federal
assimilative
crimes
act
had
been
enacted
in
1948,
which
made
state
crimes
punishable
as
federal
crimes
when
committed
inside
federal
enclaves
where
there
is
exclusive
or
concurrent
jurisdiction,
and
subsequently
all
state
liquor
laws
were
then
as
they
are
now
enforceable
by
criminal
prosecution.
now
no
mention
of
those
laws
was
made
by
cole
or
by
price
or
anyone
else
when
this
1951
federal
regulations
was
passed.
now
whatever
else
congress
may
have
had
to
do
by
that
51
law,
it
certainly
didn't
intend
to
make
military
bases
payments
for
bootleggers.
now
here
is
the
term
bootlegger,
because
since
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that's
word
that
describes
the
activities
of
people
who
sell
liquor
without
payment
of
taxes
etcetera.
now
the
defense
department
itself
construed
this
law
that
i
just
described
as
not
requiring
avoidance
of
state
regulations
of
sales
to
military
bases.
when
it
amended
its
own
regulations
in
june
1966,
that
was
just
before
mississippi’s
regulation
became
effective,
the
federal
amendment
struck
out
the
requirement
that
the
base
purchases
be
made
“without
regard
to
prices
locally
established
by
state
statutes
or
otherwise”.
it
continued
to
enforce
its
requirement
that
its
own
sales
of
packaged
liquor
be
priced
“within
10%
of
the
lowest
prevailing
rates
of
civilian
outlets
in
the
area".
now,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
on
the
face
of
the
regulations
themselves
and
the
statutes,
there
is
no
genuine
conflict
between
federal
and
mississippi
liquor
control
policies
as
they
are
expressed
in
their
respective
laws
and
regulations
in
those
policies
in
both
cases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
in
theory,
but
not
in
fact.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
in
law
it
was
a
dry
state.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that
i
can't
tell
you,
but
the
stipulation
doesn't
cover
the
pre
1966
activities.
i
would
suspect
that
was
being
freely
sold
in
country
clubs.
i
would
suspect
the
military
clubs
also
bought
it
and
sold
it,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
this
is
simply
not
part
of
the
record
that
you
have
here.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well
they
are
all
federal
enclaves.
the
difference
is
--
between
them
is
the
two
--
they
claim
that
the
grant
was
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
other
two
concurrent,
but
in
either
events
you
understand
these
cessions
of
the
basis
were
made
from
42
to
50,
this
is
while
mississippi
was
dry,
and
after
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
passed
mississippi's
right
to
regulate
to
tax
or
establish
a
markup
or
do
anything
else
with
respect
to
controlling
liquor
in
mississippi
stems
from
the
twenty-first
amendment
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
--
which
annotated
the
cessions.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
right,
and
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
can't
tell
you
but
i
would
suspect
that
there
was
liquor
on
the
bases
as
there
was
nearly
everywhere
else
in
mississippi
on
merely
the
bases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
think
its
more
identical
question
than
the
one
we
have
here
because
i
think
it's
clear
that
when
you
have
a
state
trying
to
control
what
happens
on
the
base,
conduct
on
the
base,
you
have
entirely
different
question
than
you
do
when
all
state
wants
to
do
is
to
control
the
distribution
of
liquor
to
the
base,
which
is
what
you
have
in
the
case
here,
and
then
this
was
also
involved
in
the
yosemite
case,
but
this
brings
me
to
what
i
take
are
the
two
decisive
cases
of
this
court
in
this
area.
assuming
that
you
do
believe
there
is
a
conflict
between
federal
and
state
policy,
which
i
don't
think
can
really
be
found
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
never
did
require
them
to
seek
the
lowest
price.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
this
suit
clears
the
conflict
unquestionably.
i
am
talking
about
if
you
lay
the
federal
policy
side
by
side
with
the
state
policy
as
expressed
in
the
laws
and
regulations
that
were
applied
to
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
even
if
you
regard
it
a
conflict
as
present,
i
think
your
decisions,
the
court’s
decision
in
ohio
against
helvering
and
in
collins
against
yosemite
park
decides
this
case
in
favor
of
mississippi.
now
in
1934
ohio’s
attorney
general
thought
the
moral
of
ohio
citizens
would
be
a
proof
if
they
went
to
federal
excise
tax
is
--
liquor
sales
could
be
avoided.
now,
following
the
twenty-first
amendment,
ohio
preempted
for
itself
didn't
it
suppose
to
selling,
wholesaling
liquor
within
the
state.
now,
ohio
argued
that
since
it
had
gone
into
the
liquor
business
itself
there
is
both
the
control
over
revenue
and
measure.
the
sale
of
liquor
in
ohio
was
a
sovereign
function
that
could
not
be
impaired
by
federal
action,
and
they
claim
that
the
federal
excise
tax
was
such
an
unconstitutional
impairment,
because
it
did
enormously
increase
the
prices
that
the
state
had
to
pay
for
the
liquor
itself.
now
this
court
as
far
as
to
ohio's
argument
was
refusal
to
allow
ohio's
point.
the
opinion
simply
observed
that
while
ohio
could
enter
the
liquor
business
with
a
state
monopoly,
it
could
only
do
so
subject
to
normal
non-discriminatory
business
taxation
and
all
you
have
here
is
normal
imposition
of
a
markup,
which
is
discriminatory
only
inside
of
the
clubs,
because
when
we
markup
does
apply
to
military
service,
all
taxes
are
away,
but
when
applied
to
the
private
clubs,
the
excise
tax
has
to
be
paid
which
gives
them
a
much
higher
per
case
price.
now
four
year
later
in
the
yosemite
park
case,
a
liquor
selling
concession
here
at
the
park
service
tried
to
avoid
the
payment
of
the
california
excise
tax
on
his
liquor
sales
and
couldn't
do
it.
now,
he
argued
that
he
was
the
an
agent
of
the
federal
government,
operating
in
an
enclave
where
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
now
this
court
held
that
that
the
concession
area
that
they
have
take
out
a
retailer's
permit
or
pay
california's
tax
on
retailers,
and
mississippi
is
not
attempting
to
force
these
clubs
either
to
take
out
retailer's
permit
or
pay
that
retailer's
tax.
the
court
also
held,
however,
that
the
yosemite
park
in
cession
did
have
to
pay
california’s
excise
tax,
levied
on
all
liquor
sold
“within
the
state”,
because
within
the
state
meant
anywhere
within
the
state’s
boundaries
whether
on
a
federal
enclave
or
elsewhere.
now
the
court
noted
that
california
reserved
taxing
power
when
the
park
was
conceded
to
the
government
in
1990,
but
that
doesn’t
explain
the,
sticks
to
truth,
between
the
retailer's
tax
and
the
excise
tax.
now,
california
has
treated
that
1938
decision
as
authorizing
application
of
its
excise
tax
to
all
liquor
sales
to
military
bases
within
the
state,
and
the
united
states
has
never
challenged
that
construction.
now,
california
gives
liquor
wholesalers
no
excise
tax
exemption
on
sales
made
to
non-appropriated
fund
agencies
selling
liquor
on
military
bases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
i
think
he
clearly
wasn't
an
agent
of
the
park
service.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no,
i
think
clearly
if
there
is
a
constitutional
prohibition
against
california’s
taxing
sales
of
liquor
into
a
federal
enclave,
then
nothing
california
could
do
by
its
statutes
where
they
give
it
the
right
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
think
it
was
held
as
to
that
conservration
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
they
could.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
in
that
case
it
did,
yes.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
since
that
time,
california
has
enacted
legislation
which
applies
its
tax
not
only
to
sales
to
non-appropriated
fund
instrumentalities,
at
all
the
bases
in
the
state
and
without
regard
to
the
charge
of
cession
or
without
regard
to
what
taxing
rights,
if
anyway
they
were
reserved
on
the
cases
were
ceded,
and
that
california
also
gives
no
excise
tax
exemption
to
distillers
outside
the
state
who
sell
direct
to
military
installations
where
payment
is
made
out
of
the
federal
treasury
and
the
us
has
never
attacked
california’s
right
to
do
that.
now,
in
1947,
a
distiller
did
litigate
the
matter
however.
national
distillers
tried
to
avoid
payment
of
the
tax
on
the
sale
of
41000
(inaudible)
whiskey
(inaudible)
for
distill
purposes
and
sent
to
army
medical
depot
in
los
angeles.
now
that
whiskey
was
ordered
out
of
the
st.
louis
and
shipped
to
los
angeles
from
ohio
and
the
distiller
argued
that
the
application
of
the
california
excise
tax
to
that
shipment
creates
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
federal
functions,
because
the
tax
was
included
in
the
price
the
army
paid.
now,
the
california
appellate
court
rejected
the
distiller’s
argument
and
sustained
the
tax.
that
case
is
cited
on
the
page
17
of
our
brief
in
footnote
12.
now,
the
us
could
have
intervened
in
that
case
and
carried
it
to
this
court
on
the
constitutional
issue,
but
it
didn't.
what
it's
doing
now,
is
asking
you
to
overturn
a
construction
of
that
1938
decision
in
yosemite
park
that
was
regarded
as
settled
until
this
case
was
brought
against
mississippi.
now,
if
there
is
only
solid
policy
reason
for
doing
that,
i
haven't
heard
of
expressed
into
government's
argument,
haven't
seen
in
its
brief.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
your
honor,
i
give
you
this
one
citation
that
i
thought
it
was
my
last
point.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
all
i
have
is
this
should
have
been
included
in
my
belief,
it's
a
senate
report
on
the
buck
act,
which
was
passed
in
1940.
you
will
simply
look
at
the
report,
the
finance
committee
senate
report,
1625,
76th
congress,
may
16,
1940,
you
will
see
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
defense
was
removed
entirely
insofar
as
the
sales
and
used
taxes
on
the
general
merchandise.
