ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mississippi
prohibited
the
sale
or
possession
of
alcoholic
beverages
until
1966.
in
that
year,
it
adapted
a
local
county
option
policy,
subject
to
requirement
that
the
state
tax
commission
be
the
sole
importer
and
wholesaler
of
alcoholic
beverages.
the
commission
promulgated
a
regulation
which
authorized
military
post
exchanges
and
other
military
agencies
to
purchase
liquor
either
from
the
commission
or
directly
from
distillers,
but
required
that
the
distillers
collect
from
military
and
remit
to
the
commission
a
markup
cost.
the
officers
and
non-commissioned
officers'
clubs
and
other
non-appropriated
fund
activities
had
purchased
liquor
from
out
of
state
distillers
and
suppliers
when
mississippi
was
a
dry
state,
and
they
decided
to
continue
this
practice
rather
than
purchase
from
the
commission
itself.
united
states
filed
an
action
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
this
mississippi
regulation
that
required
out
of
state
distillers
to
collect
a
percentage
sum,
designated
as
a
wholesale
markup
on
their
liquor
sales
to
certain
post
exchanges
and
other
military
organizations.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
none
whatsoever,
not
from
any
distillers
in
the
state
and
never
from
the
commission
itself.
all
of
the
purchases
by
the
military,
all
of
them
had
been
made
from
out
of
state
distillers,
never
from
the
state.
so,
the
united
states
filed
this
action
seeking
declaratory
judgment
which
said
that,
the
markup
had
to
be
collected
from
the
military
and
remitted
to
the
state
on
basis
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
also
required
the
distillers
to
remit
the
markup
to
the
mississippi
tax
commission.
the
united
states,
in
addition
to
this,
sought
to
recover
the
total
of
all
such
payments
made
by
these
military
purchasers.
incidentally
these
payments
were
made
under
protest
and
by
july
31st
of
1971,
the
total
payments
made
amounted
to
$648,421.92.
the
state
of
mississippi
ceded
and
the
united
states
acquired
jurisdiction
over
lands
within
the
state,
comprising
the
keesler
air
force
base
and
the
united
states
naval
construction
battalion
center.
mississippi
also
ceded
and
the
united
states
accepted
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
lands
comprising
the
columbus
air
force
base
and
meridian
naval
air
station.
the
court
below
decided
against
the
united
states,
stating
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
makes
mississippi
law
applicable
to
the
sales
of
liquor
to
the
military
bases
and
the
court
entered
a
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
appellees
on
all
issues.
in
his
opinion,
the
court
found
and
mississippi
conceded
on
page
5
of
its
motion
to
affirm
and
dismiss
that
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
two
bases,
namely
keesler
air
force
base
and
the
united
states
naval
construction
battalion
center,
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
united
states
and
mississippi
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
on
the
other
two,
columbus
air
force
base
and
meridian
naval
air
station,
and
we
accept
the
findings
of
that
court.
the
twenty-first
amendment
regulates
the
importation
of
liquor
into
a
state.
section
2
of
that
amendment
provides
the
transportation
or
importation
into
any
state
of
the
united
states
for
delivery
or
use
therein
of
intoxicating
liquors
in
violation
of
the
laws
thereof
is
hereby
prohibited.
we
submit
that
the
mere
finding
of
the
lower
court
that
the
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
means
that
the
federal
enclave
is
not
within
a
state,
but
is
a
separate
territory
outside
the
ambit
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
interpretation
of
the
lower
court
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
makes
mississippi
law
applicable
over
the
sales
to
the
instrumentalities
on
the
basis
over
which
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
inconsistent
with
the
case
law.
in
collins
versus
yosemite
park,
304
u.s.
518,
it
was
held
that
the
regulatory
phases
of
a
california
law
with
respect
to
the
importation
and
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
are
applicable
to
a
corporation
selling
liquor
in
a
national
park,
jurisdiction
over
which
has
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
with
a
reservation
only
of
the
right
to
tax
persons
and
corporations
in
the
ceded
territory.
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
operates
as
purely
tax
or
revenue
measure,
it
was
found
that
it
was
enforceable
in
the
park.
however,
license
fees
could
not
be
enforced,
because
the
state
did
not
reserve
the
right
to
regulate
or
license,
without
i
could
say
for
the
exception
that
it
did
reserve
its
right
to
issue
license
fees
for
fishing,
but
nothing
concerning
alcoholic
beverages.
thus,
in
collins,
california
did
not
derive
its
right
to
impose
revenue
measures
from
the
twenty-first
amendment,
but
did
so
solely
from
its
reservation
of
its
right
to
tax.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
reservation
by
mississippi
of
the
right
to
tax.
mississippi
reserved
only
the
right
to
serve
civil
and
criminal
process.
a
proper
application
of
collins
would
defeat
mississippi’s
claim
of
any
right
to
impose
any
taxes
of
a
regulatory
or
revenue
nature
or
any
taxes
whatsoever.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
exclusive,
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
this
case
involves
all
four.
what
i
am
attempting
to
deal
with
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
so
far.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
so
far,
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
would
take
up
unless
you
want
me
to
do.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right,
i
am
still
on
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
correct.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
thank
you.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
think
the
state
within
its
powers
to
control
activity
within
the
state
would
have
that
power.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir,
i
believe
the
state
of
mississippi
could
pass
such
a
law
and
make
that
a
requirement
to
check
every
individual
who
would
leave
a
military
instillation
and
make
them
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that
would
be
my
feeling,
yes
sir,
your
honor.
the
basic
constitutional
import
of
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
don’t
believe
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action,
i
don’t
believe
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
prohibit
or
to
really
state
that
they
could
only
buy
the
liquor
from
the
state
of
mississippi.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
collins
versus
yosemite,
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
and
it
has
--
yes
sir,
and
it
has
done
so
in
many
cases,
but
to
this
date
it
hasn’t
done
it
in
this
area.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no
the
answer
would
not
be
the
same
in
the
concurrent
jurisdiction,
i
don’t
believe
that,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
believe
so,
yes
that
would
be
our
position.
the
basic
constitutional
import
of
collins
is
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
make
state
laws
applicable
to
an
enclave
over
which
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
any
exercise
of
sovereignty
by
the
state
over
such
enclave
must
be
only
through
a
reservation
of
right
at
the
time
of
cession.
the
lower
court
did
not,
in
its
judgment,
differentiate
between
the
enclaves
over
which
the
united
states
exercises
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
the
other
two
bases
over
which
the
united
states
and
mississippi
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
do
so
because
of
its
interpretation
of
the
impact
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
stating
that
mississippi
laws
are
applicable
to
enclaves
under
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it
is
our
opinion
that
where
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction,
the
state
has
no
right
to
impose
a
regulatory
or
revenue
measure
upon
a
federal
instrumentality.
even
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
the
state
can
impose
regulatory
measures
only
when
the
transactions
involved
non-appropriated
funds.
so,
that
i
really
have
to
return
to
your
question
mr.
justice
to
state
that
the
same
would
apply
for
the
ones
where
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
well
as
concurrent
jurisdiction,
except
where
there
is
non-appropriated
funds,
i
think
the
state
could
limit
meridian.
such
is
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
such
is
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
they
are
mixed
your
honor.
no,
some
are
appropriated
funds.
now
the
commissaries
are
considered
appropriated
funds.
the
mess
halls
are
non-appropriated.
so,
we
have
both
kinds
in
both
the
exclusive
and
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases.
as
i
said,
even
when
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
the
state
can
impose
regulatory
measures
only
when
the
transactions
involve
non-appropriated
funds,
such
is
the
holding
of
paul
versus
united
states,
371,
u.s.
245.
the
paul
case
does
not
involve
any
enrichment
of
the
state
of
california.
it
deals
with
regulatory
measures
to
establish
minimum
health
standards
in
the
distribution
of
milk
through
a
minimum
price
statute.
paul
should
be
interpreted
as
meaning
that
even
where
the
state
and
federal
government
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
that
where
the
overriding
concern
of
the
state
for
the
health
of
its
citizens
does
not
result
in
any
direct
expenditure
of
funds
from
the
united
states
government,
the
interest
of
the
state
in
the
health
of
its
residents
shall
prevail.
the
instant
case
is
even
stronger
than
paul.
in
our
case
here
we
have
a
direct
imposition
of
a
tax
upon
the
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
there
is
a
direct
enrichment
of
the
state
through
the
imposition
of
the
markup
and
that
markup
collected
by
mississippi,
we
submit,
is
a
tax.
it
is
not
a
voluntary
payment
by
the
distillers.
how
can
it
be
voluntary
when
the
distillers
are
threatened
with
delisting,
unless
they
impose
the
markup
upon
the
instrumentalities
and
remit
it
to
the
state.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
if
the
distiller
refuses
to
collect
and
remit
the
markup,
he
will
be
denied
the
right
to
sell
its
products
and
he
maybe
prosecuted
criminally
and
he
can
made
to
serve
up
to
a
year
in
jail
or
pay
a
fine
of
$1,000
or
both.
we
submit
that
this
tax
is
a
contribution
towards
the
cost
of
maintaining
mississippi’s
governmental
function
since
it
is
paid
into
the
general
revenue
account.
in
addition
there
is
no
service
rendered
by
the
state
of
mississippi
of
on
the
exaction
the
markup.
thus
it
is
a
payment
demanded
by
the
state
of
mississippi
as
a
contribution
toward
maintaining
its
governmental
function
and
as
i
said
before
it
is
a
tax.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
other
words
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
it
depends
on
how
it's
collected.
i
would
say
this
that
if
the
markup
was
included
in
the
price
of
the
liquor
and
passed
on,
you
might
have
some
problem
showing
that
it
was
a
direct
tax
upon
the
purchaser,
but
in
this
case
it
is
almost
like
social
security
or
sales
tax.
no
one
has
any
question
about
the
fact
that
this
money
is
collected
specifically
to
be
submitted
to
the
state
of
mississippi
and
is
collected
from
the
purchasers
itself,
and
there
is
--
and
then
its
put
in
the
general
revenue
fund
of
the
state,
and
the
state
does
nothing
to
receive
this
money.
although
in
the
brief
of
my
opponent,
it
is
stated
that
this
is
for
services
rendered
by
the
distiller
in
passing
this
liquor
on
and
collecting
this.
this
is
his
service,
but
he
doesn’t
collect
the
money.
the
money
goes
directly
to
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
so
therefore
it
certainly
is
passed
onto
the
purchaser
himself.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
the
particular
and
--
the
particular
agencies
of
the
united
states
that
are
involved
both
in
the
concurrent
and
exclusive.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
i
don’t
think
that's
the
issue
at
all.
i
feel
--
we
have
cases,
one
case
is
standard
oil
case
versus
johnson
that
was
passed
in
1941
where
mr.
justice
black
held
that
the
messes,
which
were
considered
--
which
earn
from
appropriated
funds,
he
held
in
that
case,
your
honor,
that
the
messes
are
instrumentalities
of
the
government
and
now
i
have
a
specific
language
here.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
federal
trot
claims?
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
case,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
case,
but
i
certainly
feel
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
tax
situation
which
might
not
necessarily
flow
over
into
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well,
if
we
followed
that
thinking
a
little
further,
i
would
say
that
where
you
have
non-appropriated
activities,
where
there
is
no
financial
detriment
to
the
united
states,
that
the
united
states
would
not
be
liable.
so
court
stated
in
united
states
versus
la
franca
at
282,
u.s.
568
and
572,
"a
tax
in
an
enforced
contribution
to
provide
for
the
support
of
government."
appellee
concede
that
the
markup
payments
maybe
treated
as
an
excise
tax
in
its
motion
to
affirm
or
dismiss
at
page
11.
this
tax,
we
submit,
is
imposed
upon
the
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
in
both
the
appropriated
and
non-appropriated.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir,
it
would.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
because
the
--
it
has
been
interpreted
in
standard
oil
versus
johnson
that
these
mess
halls
are
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
even
though
non-appropriated
funds.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
1941,
it's
at
50
u.s.
--
i
can’t
find
exactly
where
you
are
reading,
would
you
please?
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
5
u.s.c.,
i
don’t
know
what
year
that
would
have
been.
the
fact
that
mississippi
found
it
expedient
to
collect
those
revenues
directly
from
the
distiller
does
not
change
the
reality
that
the
burden
of
payment
is
directly
placed
upon
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government.
it
is
true
that
mississippi
normally
imposes
the
tax
upon
the
distillers,
but
in
operation
and
effect
these
taxes
go
upon
the
purchaser.
it
is
well
settled
that
a
state
may
not
impose
a
tax
upon
the
transactions
of
the
united
states
government
or
upon
its
instrumentalities
and
agencies.
the
tax
here
is
imposed
upon
governmental
instrumentalities,
the
united
states
army
post
exchange
and
various
clubs.
the
supreme
court
in
1942
in
standard
oil
versus
johnson
316
u.s.
481,
the
question
was
settled
that
army
post
exchanges
are
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states,
and
army
post
exchanges
are
out
of
non-appropriate
funds.
mr.
justice
black
said
there
that
post
exchanges
are
arms
of
the
government,
deemed
by
it
as
essential
for
the
performance
of
governmental
functions
and
partake
of
whatever
immunities
the
armed
services
may
have
under
the
constitution
and
the
federal
statutes.
the
reasoning
of
the
johnson
case
has
been
extended
to
include
military
messes
and
officers
clubs
in
many
cases.
the
fundamental
principle
that
federal
instrumentalities
are
immune
from
state
taxation
was
first
stated
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland.
that
principle
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
concept
of
federalism
and
has
not
been
abrogated
to
this
date.
for
all
of
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you,
very
much.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
waive
my
right
to
rebuttal.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
see
no
reason
or
any
real
necessity
for
the
distillers
being
made
party
plaintiff
to
this
case.
the
united
states
government
is
attacking
the
whole
regulation
and
the
united
states
is
certainly,
the
purchaser,
the
real
party
in
interest,
because
he
has
to
pay
the
money,
the
distiller
is
just
a
conduit
passing
it
on
and
it’s
expressly
stated
that
way.
i
don't
think
it
would
detract
from
the
case
however,
if
the
distillers
were
made
party
plaintiffs.
but
i
don't
feel
that
there
would
be
a
necessity
for
it.
ms.

lafontant
certain
price,
i
would
agree
that
mississippi
could
do
that.
if
they
--
if
mississippi
had
passed
such
a
law,
i
don't
believe
we
could
be
here,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
it's
the
manner
in
which
--
the
method
of
which
it
takes
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
except
i
feel
that
the
--
in
the
enclaves
where
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction,
that
there
might
be
a
problem.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
and
we
couldn't
argue
with
their
price.
i
will
agree
with
you,
if
it
was
in
the
total
price,
we
would
have
no
cost
bargaining.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well,
i
think
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
the
method
and
the
way
it
is
set
out.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
my
haste,
i
didn't
get
to
clarify
because
then
i
followed
up
to
a
subsequent
question
that
it
would
still
be
the
position
of
the
united
states
government
that
on
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases
that
no
state
could
control
the
price
of
anything.
ms.
jewell

lafontant
yes

thank
you
very
much.
ms.
jewell

lafontant
thank

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mississippi
prohibited
the
sale
or
possession
of
alcoholic
beverages
until
1966.
in
that
year,
it
adapted
a
local
county
option
policy,
subject
to
requirement
that
the
state
tax
commission
be
the
sole
importer
and
wholesaler
of
alcoholic
beverages.
the
commission
promulgated
a
regulation
which
authorized
military
post
exchanges
and
other
military
agencies
to
purchase
liquor
either
from
the
commission
or
directly
from
distillers,
but
required
that
the
distillers
collect
from
military
and
remit
to
the
commission
a
markup
cost.
the
officers
and
non-commissioned
officers'
clubs
and
other
non-appropriated
fund
activities
had
purchased
liquor
from
out
of
state
distillers
and
suppliers
when
mississippi
was
a
dry
state,
and
they
decided
to
continue
this
practice
rather
than
purchase
from
the
commission
itself.
united
states
filed
an
action
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
this
mississippi
regulation
that
required
out
of
state
distillers
to
collect
a
percentage
sum,
designated
as
a
wholesale
markup
on
their
liquor
sales
to
certain
post
exchanges
and
other
military
organizations.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
none
whatsoever,
not
from
any
distillers
in
the
state
and
never
from
the
commission
itself.
all
of
the
purchases
by
the
military,
all
of
them
had
been
made
from
out
of
state
distillers,
never
from
the
state.
so,
the
united
states
filed
this
action
seeking
declaratory
judgment
which
said
that,
the
markup
had
to
be
collected
from
the
military
and
remitted
to
the
state
on
basis
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
also
required
the
distillers
to
remit
the
markup
to
the
mississippi
tax
commission.
the
united
states,
in
addition
to
this,
sought
to
recover
the
total
of
all
such
payments
made
by
these
military
purchasers.
incidentally
these
payments
were
made
under
protest
and
by
july
31st
of
1971,
the
total
payments
made
amounted
to
$648,421.92.
the
state
of
mississippi
ceded
and
the
united
states
acquired
jurisdiction
over
lands
within
the
state,
comprising
the
keesler
air
force
base
and
the
united
states
naval
construction
battalion
center.
mississippi
also
ceded
and
the
united
states
accepted
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
lands
comprising
the
columbus
air
force
base
and
meridian
naval
air
station.
the
court
below
decided
against
the
united
states,
stating
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
makes
mississippi
law
applicable
to
the
sales
of
liquor
to
the
military
bases
and
the
court
entered
a
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
appellees
on
all
issues.
in
his
opinion,
the
court
found
and
mississippi
conceded
on
page
5
of
its
motion
to
affirm
and
dismiss
that
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
two
bases,
namely
keesler
air
force
base
and
the
united
states
naval
construction
battalion
center,
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
united
states
and
mississippi
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
on
the
other
two,
columbus
air
force
base
and
meridian
naval
air
station,
and
we
accept
the
findings
of
that
court.
the
twenty-first
amendment
regulates
the
importation
of
liquor
into
a
state.
section
2
of
that
amendment
provides
the
transportation
or
importation
into
any
state
of
the
united
states
for
delivery
or
use
therein
of
intoxicating
liquors
in
violation
of
the
laws
thereof
is
hereby
prohibited.
we
submit
that
the
mere
finding
of
the
lower
court
that
the
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
means
that
the
federal
enclave
is
not
within
a
state,
but
is
a
separate
territory
outside
the
ambit
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
interpretation
of
the
lower
court
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
makes
mississippi
law
applicable
over
the
sales
to
the
instrumentalities
on
the
basis
over
which
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
inconsistent
with
the
case
law.
in
collins
versus
yosemite
park,
304
u.s.
518,
it
was
held
that
the
regulatory
phases
of
a
california
law
with
respect
to
the
importation
and
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
are
applicable
to
a
corporation
selling
liquor
in
a
national
park,
jurisdiction
over
which
has
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
with
a
reservation
only
of
the
right
to
tax
persons
and
corporations
in
the
ceded
territory.
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
operates
as
purely
tax
or
revenue
measure,
it
was
found
that
it
was
enforceable
in
the
park.
however,
license
fees
could
not
be
enforced,
because
the
state
did
not
reserve
the
right
to
regulate
or
license,
without
i
could
say
for
the
exception
that
it
did
reserve
its
right
to
issue
license
fees
for
fishing,
but
nothing
concerning
alcoholic
beverages.
thus,
in
collins,
california
did
not
derive
its
right
to
impose
revenue
measures
from
the
twenty-first
amendment,
but
did
so
solely
from
its
reservation
of
its
right
to
tax.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
reservation
by
mississippi
of
the
right
to
tax.
mississippi
reserved
only
the
right
to
serve
civil
and
criminal
process.
a
proper
application
of
collins
would
defeat
mississippi’s
claim
of
any
right
to
impose
any
taxes
of
a
regulatory
or
revenue
nature
or
any
taxes
whatsoever.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
exclusive,
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
this
case
involves
all
four.
what
i
am
attempting
to
deal
with
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
so
far.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
so
far,
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
would
take
up
unless
you
want
me
to
do.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right,
i
am
still
on
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
correct.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
thank
you.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
think
the
state
within
its
powers
to
control
activity
within
the
state
would
have
that
power.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir,
i
believe
the
state
of
mississippi
could
pass
such
a
law
and
make
that
a
requirement
to
check
every
individual
who
would
leave
a
military
instillation
and
make
them
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that
would
be
my
feeling,
yes
sir,
your
honor.
the
basic
constitutional
import
of
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
don’t
believe
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action,
i
don’t
believe
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
prohibit
or
to
really
state
that
they
could
only
buy
the
liquor
from
the
state
of
mississippi.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
collins
versus
yosemite,
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
and
it
has
--
yes
sir,
and
it
has
done
so
in
many
cases,
but
to
this
date
it
hasn’t
done
it
in
this
area.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no
the
answer
would
not
be
the
same
in
the
concurrent
jurisdiction,
i
don’t
believe
that,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
believe
so,
yes
that
would
be
our
position.
the
basic
constitutional
import
of
collins
is
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
make
state
laws
applicable
to
an
enclave
over
which
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
any
exercise
of
sovereignty
by
the
state
over
such
enclave
must
be
only
through
a
reservation
of
right
at
the
time
of
cession.
the
lower
court
did
not,
in
its
judgment,
differentiate
between
the
enclaves
over
which
the
united
states
exercises
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
the
other
two
bases
over
which
the
united
states
and
mississippi
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
do
so
because
of
its
interpretation
of
the
impact
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
stating
that
mississippi
laws
are
applicable
to
enclaves
under
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it
is
our
opinion
that
where
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction,
the
state
has
no
right
to
impose
a
regulatory
or
revenue
measure
upon
a
federal
instrumentality.
even
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
the
state
can
impose
regulatory
measures
only
when
the
transactions
involved
non-appropriated
funds.
so,
that
i
really
have
to
return
to
your
question
mr.
justice
to
state
that
the
same
would
apply
for
the
ones
where
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
well
as
concurrent
jurisdiction,
except
where
there
is
non-appropriated
funds,
i
think
the
state
could
limit
meridian.
such
is
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
such
is
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
they
are
mixed
your
honor.
no,
some
are
appropriated
funds.
now
the
commissaries
are
considered
appropriated
funds.
the
mess
halls
are
non-appropriated.
so,
we
have
both
kinds
in
both
the
exclusive
and
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases.
as
i
said,
even
when
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
the
state
can
impose
regulatory
measures
only
when
the
transactions
involve
non-appropriated
funds,
such
is
the
holding
of
paul
versus
united
states,
371,
u.s.
245.
the
paul
case
does
not
involve
any
enrichment
of
the
state
of
california.
it
deals
with
regulatory
measures
to
establish
minimum
health
standards
in
the
distribution
of
milk
through
a
minimum
price
statute.
paul
should
be
interpreted
as
meaning
that
even
where
the
state
and
federal
government
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
that
where
the
overriding
concern
of
the
state
for
the
health
of
its
citizens
does
not
result
in
any
direct
expenditure
of
funds
from
the
united
states
government,
the
interest
of
the
state
in
the
health
of
its
residents
shall
prevail.
the
instant
case
is
even
stronger
than
paul.
in
our
case
here
we
have
a
direct
imposition
of
a
tax
upon
the
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
there
is
a
direct
enrichment
of
the
state
through
the
imposition
of
the
markup
and
that
markup
collected
by
mississippi,
we
submit,
is
a
tax.
it
is
not
a
voluntary
payment
by
the
distillers.
how
can
it
be
voluntary
when
the
distillers
are
threatened
with
delisting,
unless
they
impose
the
markup
upon
the
instrumentalities
and
remit
it
to
the
state.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
if
the
distiller
refuses
to
collect
and
remit
the
markup,
he
will
be
denied
the
right
to
sell
its
products
and
he
maybe
prosecuted
criminally
and
he
can
made
to
serve
up
to
a
year
in
jail
or
pay
a
fine
of
$1,000
or
both.
we
submit
that
this
tax
is
a
contribution
towards
the
cost
of
maintaining
mississippi’s
governmental
function
since
it
is
paid
into
the
general
revenue
account.
in
addition
there
is
no
service
rendered
by
the
state
of
mississippi
of
on
the
exaction
the
markup.
thus
it
is
a
payment
demanded
by
the
state
of
mississippi
as
a
contribution
toward
maintaining
its
governmental
function
and
as
i
said
before
it
is
a
tax.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
other
words
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
it
depends
on
how
it's
collected.
i
would
say
this
that
if
the
markup
was
included
in
the
price
of
the
liquor
and
passed
on,
you
might
have
some
problem
showing
that
it
was
a
direct
tax
upon
the
purchaser,
but
in
this
case
it
is
almost
like
social
security
or
sales
tax.
no
one
has
any
question
about
the
fact
that
this
money
is
collected
specifically
to
be
submitted
to
the
state
of
mississippi
and
is
collected
from
the
purchasers
itself,
and
there
is
--
and
then
its
put
in
the
general
revenue
fund
of
the
state,
and
the
state
does
nothing
to
receive
this
money.
although
in
the
brief
of
my
opponent,
it
is
stated
that
this
is
for
services
rendered
by
the
distiller
in
passing
this
liquor
on
and
collecting
this.
this
is
his
service,
but
he
doesn’t
collect
the
money.
the
money
goes
directly
to
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
so
therefore
it
certainly
is
passed
onto
the
purchaser
himself.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
the
particular
and
--
the
particular
agencies
of
the
united
states
that
are
involved
both
in
the
concurrent
and
exclusive.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
i
don’t
think
that's
the
issue
at
all.
i
feel
--
we
have
cases,
one
case
is
standard
oil
case
versus
johnson
that
was
passed
in
1941
where
mr.
justice
black
held
that
the
messes,
which
were
considered
--
which
earn
from
appropriated
funds,
he
held
in
that
case,
your
honor,
that
the
messes
are
instrumentalities
of
the
government
and
now
i
have
a
specific
language
here.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
federal
trot
claims?
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
case,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
case,
but
i
certainly
feel
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
tax
situation
which
might
not
necessarily
flow
over
into
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well,
if
we
followed
that
thinking
a
little
further,
i
would
say
that
where
you
have
non-appropriated
activities,
where
there
is
no
financial
detriment
to
the
united
states,
that
the
united
states
would
not
be
liable.
so
court
stated
in
united
states
versus
la
franca
at
282,
u.s.
568
and
572,
"a
tax
in
an
enforced
contribution
to
provide
for
the
support
of
government."
appellee
concede
that
the
markup
payments
maybe
treated
as
an
excise
tax
in
its
motion
to
affirm
or
dismiss
at
page
11.
this
tax,
we
submit,
is
imposed
upon
the
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
in
both
the
appropriated
and
non-appropriated.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir,
it
would.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
because
the
--
it
has
been
interpreted
in
standard
oil
versus
johnson
that
these
mess
halls
are
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
even
though
non-appropriated
funds.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
1941,
it's
at
50
u.s.
--
i
can’t
find
exactly
where
you
are
reading,
would
you
please?
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
5
u.s.c.,
i
don’t
know
what
year
that
would
have
been.
the
fact
that
mississippi
found
it
expedient
to
collect
those
revenues
directly
from
the
distiller
does
not
change
the
reality
that
the
burden
of
payment
is
directly
placed
upon
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government.
it
is
true
that
mississippi
normally
imposes
the
tax
upon
the
distillers,
but
in
operation
and
effect
these
taxes
go
upon
the
purchaser.
it
is
well
settled
that
a
state
may
not
impose
a
tax
upon
the
transactions
of
the
united
states
government
or
upon
its
instrumentalities
and
agencies.
the
tax
here
is
imposed
upon
governmental
instrumentalities,
the
united
states
army
post
exchange
and
various
clubs.
the
supreme
court
in
1942
in
standard
oil
versus
johnson
316
u.s.
481,
the
question
was
settled
that
army
post
exchanges
are
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states,
and
army
post
exchanges
are
out
of
non-appropriate
funds.
mr.
justice
black
said
there
that
post
exchanges
are
arms
of
the
government,
deemed
by
it
as
essential
for
the
performance
of
governmental
functions
and
partake
of
whatever
immunities
the
armed
services
may
have
under
the
constitution
and
the
federal
statutes.
the
reasoning
of
the
johnson
case
has
been
extended
to
include
military
messes
and
officers
clubs
in
many
cases.
the
fundamental
principle
that
federal
instrumentalities
are
immune
from
state
taxation
was
first
stated
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland.
that
principle
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
concept
of
federalism
and
has
not
been
abrogated
to
this
date.
for
all
of
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you,
very
much.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
waive
my
right
to
rebuttal.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
see
no
reason
or
any
real
necessity
for
the
distillers
being
made
party
plaintiff
to
this
case.
the
united
states
government
is
attacking
the
whole
regulation
and
the
united
states
is
certainly,
the
purchaser,
the
real
party
in
interest,
because
he
has
to
pay
the
money,
the
distiller
is
just
a
conduit
passing
it
on
and
it’s
expressly
stated
that
way.
i
don't
think
it
would
detract
from
the
case
however,
if
the
distillers
were
made
party
plaintiffs.
but
i
don't
feel
that
there
would
be
a
necessity
for
it.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
certain
price,
i
would
agree
that
mississippi
could
do
that.
if
they
--
if
mississippi
had
passed
such
a
law,
i
don't
believe
we
could
be
here,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
it's
the
manner
in
which
--
the
method
of
which
it
takes
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
except
i
feel
that
the
--
in
the
enclaves
where
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction,
that
there
might
be
a
problem.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
and
we
couldn't
argue
with
their
price.
i
will
agree
with
you,
if
it
was
in
the
total
price,
we
would
have
no
cost
bargaining.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well,
i
think
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
the
method
and
the
way
it
is
set
out.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
my
haste,
i
didn't
get
to
clarify
because
then
i
followed
up
to
a
subsequent
question
that
it
would
still
be
the
position
of
the
united
states
government
that
on
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases
that
no
state
could
control
the
price
of
anything.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
