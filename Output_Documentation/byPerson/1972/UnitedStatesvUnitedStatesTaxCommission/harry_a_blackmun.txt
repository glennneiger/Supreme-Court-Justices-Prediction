well,
at
this
point
could
i
ask
you
a
question
please?
what
is
the
government’s
attitude
with
respect
to
mississippi’s
power
to
regulate
intoxicants
taken
off
the
base?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
mean
you
told
us
that
the
post
orders
the
direct
from
the
distillers
and
i
suppose
if
they
follow
the
other
alternative
of
ordering
liquor
from
the
tax
commission,
then
they
would
pay
the
markup
or
would
they
not?
