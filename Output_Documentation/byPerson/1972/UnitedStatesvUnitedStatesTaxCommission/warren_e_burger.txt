warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-350,
united
states
against
the
tax
commission
of
mississippi.
mrs.
lafontant,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
the
military
at
any
time
made
purchases
directly
from
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
position
of
the
government
would
be
that
mississippi
would
have
the
right
to
regulate
the
taking
of
intoxicants
off
the
base.
our
position
is
that
it
has
no
right
to
tax
or
regulate
intoxicants
that
are
taken
into
the
base,
which
is
a
military
enclave,
a
federal
enclave.
in
other
words,
they
could
have
a
policeman
at
the
door,
at
the
gate
of
the
military
enclave
to
check
people
who
are
taking
intoxicants
off,
if
that
would
be
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
it
--
but,
it
follow
from
that,
that
they
could
require
a
declaration
each
time
a
person
left
to
much
like
the
declaration
you
make
when
you
come
into
the
united
states,
a
declaration
stating
that
you
did
not
have
any
liquor
or
that
you
would
had
three-fifths,
could
they
do
that
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
make
it
a
criminal
offense
for
any
or
al
least
to
tax
some
kind
of
sanctions
to
the
violators.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
could
surrender
some
of
this
supremacy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
tort
claims
act
cases,
we
haven’t
had
one
here
for
a
long
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
what
--
an
activity
sponsored
by
non-appropriated
funds,
united
states
is
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act,
in
an
officer's
club
for
example?
it
seems
to
me
i
remember
a
swimming
pool
case,
at
court
of
appeals
level,
where
they
held
it
was
an
instrumentality
for
the
purposes
of
the
tort
claims
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
won't
follow
necessarily,
but
there
is
some
relevance
to
it
i
would
assume?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
becomes
the
status
of
post
exchanges.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
a
question
that
somewhat
like
mr.
justice
powell’s
question.
does
mississippi
have
a
tax
on
cigarettes,
for
example,
a
state
tax?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
probably
do,
almost
everybody
does.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
can
they
tax,
i
am
not
concerned
about
whether
they
do
or
not
do,
assert
that
mississippi
has
a
right
to
--
the
power
to
tax
cigarettes
with
the
state
tax
that
are
sold
in
the
exchanges.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
--
do
you
have
any
indian
reservations
in
mississippi?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
trying
to
get
out
some
of
the
same
things
that
you
were
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
talking
about
before.
would
you
assert
the
state's
power
on
an
indian
reservation
with
respect
to
liquor
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
lay
aside
the
fact,
what
is
your
view
of
the
power?
could
mississippi
have
prohibited
liquor
on
military
enclave?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
mr.
wright,
your
analysis
of
the
yosemite
case
would
seem
to
equate
the
concession
error
with
an
instrumentality,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
make
no
distinction
on
the
other
factors
in
yosemite
about
the
consent
of
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
does
the
government
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
seem
to
be
conceding
something,
and
i
am
not
sure
without
some
authority,
i
couldn't
accept,
namely
that
any
state
has
the
power
to
fix
the
price
at
which
the
united
states
government
buys
anything,
liquor,
milk
or
turnips?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
