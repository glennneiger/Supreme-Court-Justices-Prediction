mrs.
lafontant,
would
you
say
that's
true
as
to
any
state
liquor
operation
where
the
state
gets
the
markup
that
a
wholesaler
normally
would,
that's,
in

a
tax?
justice

mrs.
lafontant,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
if
i
may
before
you
waive.
it
seems
to
me
at
least
possible
that
a
distiller
is
either
an
indispensable
party
or
perhaps
the
only
party
here
who
can
raise
this
type
of
an
issue
that
the
government
has
made
these
payments
to
the
distillers.
the
distillers
aren't
a
public
body
which
--
or
nearly
pay
under
protest,
doing
it
the
distiller
has
in
turn
remitted
the
payments
to
the
state
of
mississippi.
don't
you
think
that
perhaps
the
distillers
ought
to
be
parties
in
order
that
these
issues
you
have
brought
can
be
properly
raised
and
adjudicated?
