now
this

this
goes
across
this
argument,
it
goes
across

well,
it
would

it

is
not
asserted
a
right

you

awfully
sorry
we
just
wanted

entertain

brought
your
lawsuit?
justice

well,
could

ask
you?
couldn't

required
all

sell
in
mississippi
to
charge
everybody,
all
of

a
certain
price?

price?”
justice

well,
then
--
and
if
you
couldn't
complain
about

how
come
you
can
complain
if
they
go
one
step
farther
and
they
say,
“by
the

give
us
part
of
the
price
that
we
