mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case.
it
is
here
on
the
government’s
petition
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
here
rises
out
of
one
of
the
interesting
developments
in
modern
society.
in
california,
there
is
a
substantial
system
of
both
group
medical
insurance
and
group
medical
practice.
in
this
particular
case,
the
medical
insurance
is
provided
by
kaiser
foundation
health
plan
incorporated
and
the
medical
services
are
provided
by
a
partnership
known
as
permanente
medical
group.
the
individual
taxpayers
before
the
court
are
members
of
this
partnership
or
their
spouses
in
cases
where
joint
returns
were
filed.
the
years
involved
are
1960
and
1961
except
in
one
case
where
1962
and
1963
are
also
involved.
the
case
was
heard
in
a
district
court
on
a
stipulation
of
facts.
the
basic
stipulation
appears
at
pages
at
79
to
88
of
the
appendix.
and
the
texts
to
the
stipulation
are
the
full
text
of
three
substantial
documents
attached
to
in
a
part
of
the
stipulation.
and
the
case
turns
largely
on
the
effect
of
those
documents
and
payments
made
pursuant
to
them
under
the
federal
tax
laws.
the
first
of
these
documents
is
the
partnership
agreement
of
the
permanente
medical
group
usually
referred
to
in
this
case
simply
as
medical
group.
this
partnership
agreement
appears
on
pages
102
through
113
of
the
appendix.
the
next
document
appearing
at
pages
116
through
150
of
the
appendix
is
the
medical
service
agreement
being
a
contract
entered
into
as
of
july
1,
1959
by
the
kaiser
foundation
health
plan
which
is
obligated
to
produce
services
under
its
contracts
with
its
members
and
the
medical
group
which
thereby
undertook
the
obligation
to
provide
the
services.
under
this
contract,
medical
group
agreed
to
supply
health
services
to
the
members
of
the
health
plan
and
the
health
plan
agreed
to
make
payments
to
medical
group.
the
question
and
issue
in
this
case
relates
to
a
portion
of
the
payments
and
i
will
spell
this
out
in
detail
in
just
a
moment.
finally,
there
is
in
the
appendix
at
pages
159
through
199,
a
trust
agreement
establishing
a
retirement
plan
for
the
permanente
medical
group.
that
is
the
way
it
is
entitled
at
the
beginning,
trust
agreement,
retirement
plan
for
the
permanente
medical
group
on
page
159.
this
is
a
typical
non-vested
retirement
plan
providing
for
benefits
for
physicians
only
and
only
to
the
physicians
who
persists
in
their
connection
with
medical
group
or
related
groups
for
period
stated
in
the
trust.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
no
non-medical
employees
in
this
retirement
plan.
non-medical
employees
were
taking
care
off
in
some
way,
otherwise
how
is
not
--
does
not
appear
in
the
appendix.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
did
that
plan?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
the
plan
covers
physicians
who
are
employees
of
permanente
medical
group
as
well
as
physician
to
our
partners
in
permanente
medical
group.
the
payments
involved
in
this
case
were
made
by
health
plan
to
the
trust
pursuant
to
the
agreement
between
health
plan
and
the
partnership
at
medical
group
and
let
us
now
turn
more
specifically
to
the
agreement.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
page
122
of
the
appendix
which
is
in
the
agreement
between
health
plan
and
medical
group.
section
(b)
(3)
of
the
agreement,
recites
this.
this
is
near
the
top
of
page
122.
health
plan
desires
to
arrange
by
contract
for
all
medical
services
in
the
service
area
required
to
satisfy
or
convenient
or
incidental
in
connection
with
satisfying
the
medical
service
obligations
provided
in
membership
contracts.
medical
group
agrees
to
provide
such
medical
services
for
the
consideration
and
subject
to
the
terms
and
conditions
set
forth
in
this
agreement.
thus
all
of
the
payments
provided
by
the
agreement
are
expressly
stated
to
be
in
consideration
of
the
services
rendered
by
medical
group.
similarly
at
the
bottom
of
page
124
of
the
appendix,
it
is
agreed
that
and
i
quote
the
last
two
lines
on
124,
“with
the
end
of
service
area,
medical
group
shall
provide
to
all
members,
all
medical
services
required
by
or
incident
to
membership
contracts.”
and
then
at
the
top
of
page
126,
appears
section
(c)
(3)
of
the
contract
under
the
heading,
compensation
for
medical
services.
and
the
first
sentence
of
(c)
(3)
reads
“as
full
consideration
for
rendering
medical
services
as
required
by
section
(c)
(1)
and
(c)
(2),
medical
group
shall
receive
the
compensation
provided
in
part
three
here
up.”
and
this
leads
us
to
part
3
of
the
contract,
article
h
beginning
on
page
137
of
the
appendix
and
continuing
for
the
next
several
pages.
it
is
there
provided
in
the
introduction
to
article
h,
“as
base
compensation
to
medical
group
for
medical
services
to
be
provided
by
medical
group
hereunder.
health
plan
shall
pay
to
medical
group
the
amounts
specified
in
this
article
h.”
and
then
each
one
then
provides
for
the
per
member
price
and
provides
for
a
payment
based
on
the
number
of
members.
the
initial
per
member
price
for
july
1959
and
each
exceeding
month,
it
appeared
near
the
bottom
of
page
137
was
$2.61329
per
member
per
month.
but
continuing
with
article
h,
it
appears
that
this
base
compensation
consists
of
several
items.
incidentally,
i
may
say
that
if
the
time
the
contract
was
entered
into,
there
were
350,000
members
that
meant
coverage
of
sum
of
900,000
persons
because
members
were
families.
i
understand
that
something
close
to
three
million
persons
are
now
covered
by
the
general
plan.
but
there
are
further
provisions
for
adjustment
to
the
per
member
price
in
section
h-2
and
h-3
on
pages
138
in
the
top
of
page
139
and
then
we
come
to
the
paragraph
which
give
rise
to
this
case.
this
is
paragraph
h-4
on
page
139
of
the
appendix
and
it
is
headed,
provision
for
savings
and
retirement
program
for
physicians.
and
since
this
is
the
key
to
the
case,
i
would
like
to
read
the
paragraph.
in
the
event
that
medical
group
establishes
a
savings
and
retirement
plan
or
other
deferred
compensation
plan
approved
by
health
plan.
health
plan
will
pay
in
addition
to
all
other
sums
payable
by
health
plan
under
this
agreement.
the
contributions
required
under
such
plan
to
the
extent
that
such
contributions
exceed
amounts
if
any
contributed
by
a
physicians
as
the
plan
was
established,
the
physicians
made
no
direct
contribution.
provided,
however,
that
health
plan
shall
commence
contribution
on
july
1,
1959
and
provided
further
that
health
plan’s
obligation
to
make
such
contributions
shall
continue,
only
so
long
as
this
agreement
or
any
continuation
or
extension
generally
similar
to
this
agreement
that
shall
remain
into
--
remain
in
effect.
and
it
appears
later
in
the
appendix
at
162
that
the
rate
of
health
plans
contribution
to
this
trust
shall
be
12
cents
per
member
per
month.
and
with
350,000
members,
that
worth
out
to
about
$500,000
per
year
and
the
record
shows
that
over
a
period
of
four
years
something
over
$2
million
was
paid
by
health
plan
into
the
retirement
trust.
following
the
execution
of
the
medical
service
agreement,
that
is
the
agreement
between
health
plan
and
medical
group,
the
trust
agreement
was
entered
into.
it
was
actually
signed
about
december
30,
1959,
but
it
was
effective
as
of
july
1,
1959,
the
date
when
the
agreement
between
health
services
and
medical
group
became
effective
and
nothing
turns
on
the
fact
that
there
was
some
delay
and
working
out
and
finally
signing
the
trust
agreement.
as
i’ve
already
indicated
the
trust
agreement
is
entitled
retirement
plan
for
the
permanente
medical
group.
and
it
is
a
typical
non-vested
retirement
trust.
it
provides
for
benefits
only
to
physicians,
but
it
includes
not
only
the
partners
in
medical
group,
but
also
physicians
who
are
employees
of
the
group.
it
provides
for
tentative
credits
for
each
physician
based
upon
his
age,
experience,
and
length
of
service.
it
provides
that
these
credits
may
be
forfeited
if
the
physician
leaves
the
partnership
or
its
employee
except
under
certain
circumstances.
in
that
event,
the
forfeited
amounts
are
creditable
to
the
other
physicians
who
are
beneficiaries
of
the
trust.
as
the
respondents
here
agree
and
expressly
stated
page
4
of
their
brief,
in
no
event
is
any
amount
refundable
to
health
plan.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
we
get
to
that
question
only
if
we
assume
that
the
payments
are
income
to
the
trust,
but
if
it
is
decided
as
we
contend
that
the
payments
are
always
income
to
medical
group
then
it
simply
becomes
a
question
of
what
is
the
distributable
share
of
each
partners’
income
in
the
trust
each
year.
and
the
payment
to
the
trust
we
contend
is
income
to
the
medical
group
partnership
and
it’s
a
part
of
the
income
which
must
be
shown
on
the
information
return
of
the
partnership
and
allocated
to
the
partners
and
proportion
to
their
interest
in
the
partnership
income.
in
that
so,
what
happens
to
any
particular
physicians
interest
and
a
trust
is
an
irrelevant
as
far
as
this
case
is
concern.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice.
he
simply
has
a
--
perhaps
a
reduced
income
from
the
trust
which
will
affect
him.
but
this
is
from
point
of
view
of
the
tax
law
as
we
contend
the
same
as
if
the
payment
was
made
to
medical
group
and
medical
group
then
made
a
payment
to
the
retirement
trust.
that
would
not
be
income
to
the
partnership
when
it
was
paid
to
the
retirement
--
to
the
partner
when
it
was
paid
to
the
retirement
trust
and
it
would
not
be
a
loss
to
the
partner
when
it
--if
he
had
a
forfeiture.
i
think
this
all
turns
on
the
somewhat
subtle
but
nevertheless
controlling
issue
in
this
case,
are
these
payments
income
to
the
medical
group
which
we
contend
they
are
or
are
they
income
to
the
partnership
--
to
the
retirement
trust
which
is
the
basis
which
the
court
below
decided?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
that
depends
on
–
in
the
first
place,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
about
this
or
whatever.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
taking
--
taking
a
typical
one
if
the
retirement
plan
is
for
employees
and
if
it
is
nondiscriminatory
so
that
it
meets
the
standards
of
section
401
and
following
of
the
internal
revenue
code
then
amounts
paid
into
it
would
be
deductible
by
medical
plan
and
would
not
be
taxable
to
the
employees
until
they
were
paid
out
to
the
employees.
this
plan
is
quite
clearly,
not
within
section
401.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
discriminatory
because
it
applies
only
to
the
top-salaried
people,
the
physicians,
but
even
more
clearly,
it
is
not
exclusively
for
employees
and
their
beneficiaries
which
are
the
only
things
to
which
the
retirement
trust
provisions
in
section
401
apply.
in
the
years
involved
here,
at
least
1960,
1961,
there
was
no
provision
whatever
in
the
law
for
a
retirement,
deduction
of
retirement
benefits
for
self-employed
persons
and
partners
are
of
course
self-employed
persons
as
partners
in
law
offices
have
known
with
respect
to
the
tax
law
for
a
long
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
that’s
exactly
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
may
--
he
may
mr.
justice
have
a
perhaps
even
an
ordinary
loss.
he
may
have
a
deduction
for
a
loss.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
--
this
record
for
determining
that
and
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
as
to
that
loss
except
as
it
bears
on
the
remaining
problem.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
would
surely
--
it
would
certainly
increase
his
basis
in
the
partnership.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
certainly
increases
basis
in
the
partnership.
indeed,
there
has
been
confusion
in
this
case
about
this
and
it
is
a
complicated
case.
let
me
point
out
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
my
answer
was
quite
and
adequate
and
perhaps
illustrates
the
difficulty
of
the
case
to
one
who
has
been
working
on
it
for
months.
it
is
quite
plain
that
the
increase
in
income,
not
offset
by
a
corresponding
withdrawal
of
funds
from
the
partnership
would
increase
each
partner’s
basis
in
the
partnership
and
would
be
taken
into
account
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
probably,
it
matters
due
from
the
partnership.
incidentally,
in
the
foldout,
just
before
page
203
is
the
computation
of
the
amounts
allocated
to
each
partner
in
this
case
by
the
revenue
agent.
and
i
think
this
illustrates
the
same
thing
because
i
believe
that
there
was
an
error
by
the
revenue
agent
in
calculating
the
deficiencies
because
he
apparently
allocated
the
payments
--
payment
to
the
trust
on
the
basis
of
the
retirement
formula
in
the
trust.
but
the
payment
should
have
been
allocated
only
to
partners
and
to
partners
on
a
pro-rata
basis
since
that
it
is
the
way
that
all
earnings
and
excess
of
withdrawing
accounts
were
distributable
under
the
partnership
agreement.
now
this
question
is
covered
by
paragraph
24
of
the
stipulation
at
page
87
down
at
the
bottom.
the
partners
agree
--
the
parties
agree
that
any
recomputations
of
the
various
sums
involved
in
these
actions
which
may
be
required
by
court’s
adjudication
herein
will
be
made,
verified,
and
settled
by
counsel.
and
i’m
--
i
feel
fairly
confident
that
after
this
court’s
decision
that
can
be
done.
but
in
the
event,
that
counsel
cannot
agree
upon
such
recomputations.
the
sums
may
be
settled
by
the
court
upon
application
in
10
days
notice.
and
i
mentioned
this
because
it
may
be
what
through
the
court
below
of
the
track,
same
way
that
i
think
i
was
throwing
off
the
track
and
i
would
like
to
avoid
suggesting
the
same
error
here.
this
case
can
be
made
to
appear
and
very
likely
is,
very
complicated.
there
is
even
a
considerable
discussion
in
the
respondent’s
brief
to
the
effect
that
the
government
is
preceding
on
the
entity
theory
of
partnerships
while
they
said
that
the
conduit
theory
is
applicable.
it
seems
odd
that
we
should
still
be
discussing
such
things
in
1972.
i
think
it
is
by
now
accepted
that
partnerships
are
both
entities
and
aggregates
and
are
so
treated
in
the
tax
law.
they
are
treated
as
entities
were
the
purpose
of
filing
information
returns,
but
partnerships
are
not
taxed
under
our
law
and
never
have
been.
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
partners.
they
are
not
taxed
on
their
income
actually
received
from
the
partnership,
what
they
are
taxed
on
is
their
distributive
share
of
the
partnership
income
whether
they
received
or
not.
i
don’t
want
to
oversimplify
this
case,
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
question
at
issue
here
was
resolved
many
years
ago,
and
that
the
case
on
careful
examination
involves
no
question
which
has
not
been
long
established
in
our
tax
law.
the
first
of
two
cases
is
the
venerable
classic,
lucas
against
earl
decided
in
1930.
in
an
opinion
by
justice
holmes,
that
case
involved
an
agreement
between
a
husband
and
wife
under
which
the
income
of
the
husband
became
a
joint
property
of
both
spouses.
it
was
contended
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
income
was
taxable
half
to
the
husband
and
half
to
the
wife.
but
this
court
reversed
justice
holmes
and
his
one
own
opinion
said
that,
“this
case
is
not
to
be
decided
by
attenuated
subtleties.
there
is
doubt
that
the
statute
could
tax
salaries
to
those
who
earned
them
and
provide
that
the
tax
could
not
be
escaped
by
anticipatory
arrangements
and
contracts,
however,
skillfully
devised
to
prevent
the
salary
when
paid
from
vesting
even
for
a
second
in
the
man
who
earned
it.”
that
seems
to
us
the
import
of
the
statute
before
us
and
we
think
that
no
distinction
can
be
taken
according
to
the
motives
leading
to
the
arrangement
by
which
the
fruits
are
attributed
to
a
different
tree
on
that
from
which
they
grew.”
in
the
other
case
in
heiner
and
mellon
in
304
u.s.
that
involved
a
partnership
and
involved
income
which
under
the
applicable
state
law
could
not
be
paid
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
nevertheless
income
to
the
partnership
and
came
within
the
distributive
share.
let
me
turn
to
a
hypothetical
example.
let’s
assume
a
large
law
firm
with
a
hundred
or
more
partners
and
his
many
associates.
for
convenience,
i’ll
call
it
ropes
and
cromwell.
let
us
assume
that
it
has
a
large
and
important
client
which
we’ll
call
international
conglomerates,
inc.
the
client
has
worldwide
operations
and
it’s
constantly
confronted
with
legal
problems.
it
has
its
own
legal
staff
whether
it
relays
heavenly
on
the
services
provided
by
ropes
and
cromwell.
international
conglomerates
is
much
interested
in
the
continuity
of
the
services
of
the
individual
members
of
ropes
and
cromwell.
in
the
past,
ropes
and
cromwell
has
billed
at
appropriate
intervals
and
these
have
been
paid.
now,
let
us
suppose
that
ropes
and
cromwell
suggested
the
corporation
that
hereafter
10%
of
the
bill
be
paid
to
the
law
firm’s
retirement
fund.
obviously
enough,
this
would
make
no
difference
under
lucas
and
earl,
and
the
culbertson
case,
the
entire
amount
would
be
taxable
to
the
partnership.
i
don’t
think
it
would
make
any
difference
that
the
law
firm’s
retirement
fund
was
a
non-vested
one
under
which
no
partner
had
any
immediate
right.
the
payment
to
the
retirement
plan
would
still
be
income
to
the
partnership
of
ropes
and
cromwell
because
it
is
a
payment
made
on
account
of
services
rendered
by
the
partnership
and
taxable
to
the
partnership
under
lucas
and
earl.
well
now,
let
us
suppose
that
instead
of
a
payment
to
the
firm’s
retirement
fund,
the
payments
made
to
a
trust
for
such
of
the
wives
of
the
partners
at
ropes
and
cromwell
as
survived
the
partners.
here,
no
partner
would
have
any
right
to
receive
any
specific
amount.
i
suggest
though
that
the
payment
would
still
be
clearly
income
to
the
partnership.
and
finally,
let
us
assume
that
international
conglomerates
came
to
ropes
and
cromwell
and
said,
“we
are
very
much
interested
in
the
continuity
of
your
firm
and
then
encouraging
people
to
stay
here
in
order
that
they
may
have
background
and
experience
in
our
work.
with
the
result
that
when
we
have
a
problem,
we
may
go
to
someone
who
already
knows
a
great
deal
about
our
business
and
the
way
we
operate.
accordingly,
we
want
to
join
with
you
in
the
establishing
a
non-vested
pension
plan
under
which
we
will
make
regular
annual
payments
and
the
plan
will
eventually
provide
retirement
payments,
but
only
to
those
members,
employees
of
the
firm
who
satisfied
length
of
service
requirements.”
but
it
seems
to
me
is
what
we
have
here
putting
the
respondent’s
case
in
its
strongest
terms,
but
such
a
payment
would
still
be
a
payment
by
international
conglomerates,
inc.
on
account
of
services
rendered
by
ropes
and
cromwell
and
would
thus,
under
lucas
and
earl,
and
culbertson
be
income
to
ropes
and
cromwell.
since
it
is
income
to
ropes
and
cromwell,
each
partner
of
ropes
and
cromwell
would
be
taxable
on
his
distributive
share
of
that
income,
whether
distributed
or
not
and
even
though
it
could
not
be
distributed
as
this
court
held
in
heiner
and
mellon.
in
this
case,
the
payments
made
to
the
retirement
fund
by
health
plan
were
made
on
account
of
the
services
rendered
by
medical
group
and
pursuant
to
the
compensation
contract
between
health
plan
and
medical
group,
which
specifically
provided
for
the
payment
of
this
retirement
amounts
as
part
of
the
compensation,
that’s
in
quotation
mark
“payable
to
medical
group,
for
medical
services
to
be
provided
my
medical
group
hereunder.”
the
whole
point
here
is
that
payments
are
income
to
the
partnership
which
performed
the
services.
we
do
not
get
to
the
question
of
the
right
to
receive
payments
from
the
retirement
trust
until
the
payments
made
by
the
health
plan
for
the
services
of
medical
group
are
treated
as
income
to
the
retirement
trust,
but
the
payments
are
not
income
to
the
retirement
trust,
they
are
income
to
medical
group
under
the
clear
teaching
of
lucas
against
earl.
and
since
the
payments
are
income
to
medical
group,
it
does
not
matter
that
the
partnership
medical
group
by
its
contract
cost
these
amounts
to
be
payable
to
the
retirement
fund
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
had
an
immediate
vested
right
to
get
cash
and
no
partner
could
currently
receive
his
share.
in
this
respect,
the
situation
is
like
that
in
other
good
old
case,
griffiths
against
the
commissioner,
where
the
court
held
that
the
taxability
of
the
income
currently
could
not
be
defeated
despite
the
technically
elegant
arrangement
which
had
been
set
up
to
divert
the
taxability.
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
indicated
since
the
diversion
of
earned
income
that
is
the
amounts
paid
pursuant
to
a
contract
for
personal
services
rendered
runs
directly
follow
that
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
income
taxation
that
earned
income
is
taxable
to
him
who
earns
it,
no
matter
what
diversionary
arrangements
is
made
for
its
payment.
the
decision
below
is
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case.
it
is
here
on
the
government’s
petition
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
here
rises
out
of
one
of
the
interesting
developments
in
modern
society.
in
california,
there
is
a
substantial
system
of
both
group
medical
insurance
and
group
medical
practice.
in
this
particular
case,
the
medical
insurance
is
provided
by
kaiser
foundation
health
plan
incorporated
and
the
medical
services
are
provided
by
a
partnership
known
as
permanente
medical
group.
the
individual
taxpayers
before
the
court
are
members
of
this
partnership
or
their
spouses
in
cases
where
joint
returns
were
filed.
the
years
involved
are
1960
and
1961
except
in
one
case
where
1962
and
1963
are
also
involved.
the
case
was
heard
in
a
district
court
on
a
stipulation
of
facts.
the
basic
stipulation
appears
at
pages
at
79
to
88
of
the
appendix.
and
the
texts
to
the
stipulation
are
the
full
text
of
three
substantial
documents
attached
to
in
a
part
of
the
stipulation.
and
the
case
turns
largely
on
the
effect
of
those
documents
and
payments
made
pursuant
to
them
under
the
federal
tax
laws.
the
first
of
these
documents
is
the
partnership
agreement
of
the
permanente
medical
group
usually
referred
to
in
this
case
simply
as
medical
group.
this
partnership
agreement
appears
on
pages
102
through
113
of
the
appendix.
the
next
document
appearing
at
pages
116
through
150
of
the
appendix
is
the
medical
service
agreement
being
a
contract
entered
into
as
of
july
1,
1959
by
the
kaiser
foundation
health
plan
which
is
obligated
to
produce
services
under
its
contracts
with
its
members
and
the
medical
group
which
thereby
undertook
the
obligation
to
provide
the
services.
under
this
contract,
medical
group
agreed
to
supply
health
services
to
the
members
of
the
health
plan
and
the
health
plan
agreed
to
make
payments
to
medical
group.
the
question
and
issue
in
this
case
relates
to
a
portion
of
the
payments
and
i
will
spell
this
out
in
detail
in
just
a
moment.
finally,
there
is
in
the
appendix
at
pages
159
through
199,
a
trust
agreement
establishing
a
retirement
plan
for
the
permanente
medical
group.
that
is
the
way
it
is
entitled
at
the
beginning,
trust
agreement,
retirement
plan
for
the
permanente
medical
group
on
page
159.
this
is
a
typical
non-vested
retirement
plan
providing
for
benefits
for
physicians
only
and
only
to
the
physicians
who
persists
in
their
connection
with
medical
group
or
related
groups
for
period
stated
in
the
trust.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
no
non-medical
employees
in
this
retirement
plan.
non-medical
employees
were
taking
care
off
in
some
way,
otherwise
how
is
not
--
does
not
appear
in
the
appendix.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
did
that
plan?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
the
plan
covers
physicians
who
are
employees
of
permanente
medical
group
as
well
as
physician
to
our
partners
in
permanente
medical
group.
the
payments
involved
in
this
case
were
made
by
health
plan
to
the
trust
pursuant
to
the
agreement
between
health
plan
and
the
partnership
at
medical
group
and
let
us
now
turn
more
specifically
to
the
agreement.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
page
122
of
the
appendix
which
is
in
the
agreement
between
health
plan
and
medical
group.
section
(b)
(3)
of
the
agreement,
recites
this.
this
is
near
the
top
of
page
122.
health
plan
desires
to
arrange
by
contract
for
all
medical
services
in
the
service
area
required
to
satisfy
or
convenient
or
incidental
in
connection
with
satisfying
the
medical
service
obligations
provided
in
membership
contracts.
medical
group
agrees
to
provide
such
medical
services
for
the
consideration
and
subject
to
the
terms
and
conditions
set
forth
in
this
agreement.
thus
all
of
the
payments
provided
by
the
agreement
are
expressly
stated
to
be
in
consideration
of
the
services
rendered
by
medical
group.
similarly
at
the
bottom
of
page
124
of
the
appendix,
it
is
agreed
that
and
i
quote
the
last
two
lines
on
124,
“with
the
end
of
service
area,
medical
group
shall
provide
to
all
members,
all
medical
services
required
by
or
incident
to
membership
contracts.”
and
then
at
the
top
of
page
126,
appears
section
(c)
(3)
of
the
contract
under
the
heading,
compensation
for
medical
services.
and
the
first
sentence
of
(c)
(3)
reads
“as
full
consideration
for
rendering
medical
services
as
required
by
section
(c)
(1)
and
(c)
(2),
medical
group
shall
receive
the
compensation
provided
in
part
three
here
up.”
and
this
leads
us
to
part
3
of
the
contract,
article
h
beginning
on
page
137
of
the
appendix
and
continuing
for
the
next
several
pages.
it
is
there
provided
in
the
introduction
to
article
h,
“as
base
compensation
to
medical
group
for
medical
services
to
be
provided
by
medical
group
hereunder.
health
plan
shall
pay
to
medical
group
the
amounts
specified
in
this
article
h.”
and
then
each
one
then
provides
for
the
per
member
price
and
provides
for
a
payment
based
on
the
number
of
members.
the
initial
per
member
price
for
july
1959
and
each
exceeding
month,
it
appeared
near
the
bottom
of
page
137
was
$2.61329
per
member
per
month.
but
continuing
with
article
h,
it
appears
that
this
base
compensation
consists
of
several
items.
incidentally,
i
may
say
that
if
the
time
the
contract
was
entered
into,
there
were
350,000
members
that
meant
coverage
of
sum
of
900,000
persons
because
members
were
families.
i
understand
that
something
close
to
three
million
persons
are
now
covered
by
the
general
plan.
but
there
are
further
provisions
for
adjustment
to
the
per
member
price
in
section
h-2
and
h-3
on
pages
138
in
the
top
of
page
139
and
then
we
come
to
the
paragraph
which
give
rise
to
this
case.
this
is
paragraph
h-4
on
page
139
of
the
appendix
and
it
is
headed,
provision
for
savings
and
retirement
program
for
physicians.
and
since
this
is
the
key
to
the
case,
i
would
like
to
read
the
paragraph.
in
the
event
that
medical
group
establishes
a
savings
and
retirement
plan
or
other
deferred
compensation
plan
approved
by
health
plan.
health
plan
will
pay
in
addition
to
all
other
sums
payable
by
health
plan
under
this
agreement.
the
contributions
required
under
such
plan
to
the
extent
that
such
contributions
exceed
amounts
if
any
contributed
by
a
physicians
as
the
plan
was
established,
the
physicians
made
no
direct
contribution.
provided,
however,
that
health
plan
shall
commence
contribution
on
july
1,
1959
and
provided
further
that
health
plan’s
obligation
to
make
such
contributions
shall
continue,
only
so
long
as
this
agreement
or
any
continuation
or
extension
generally
similar
to
this
agreement
that
shall
remain
into
--
remain
in
effect.
and
it
appears
later
in
the
appendix
at
162
that
the
rate
of
health
plans
contribution
to
this
trust
shall
be
12
cents
per
member
per
month.
and
with
350,000
members,
that
worth
out
to
about
$500,000
per
year
and
the
record
shows
that
over
a
period
of
four
years
something
over
$2
million
was
paid
by
health
plan
into
the
retirement
trust.
following
the
execution
of
the
medical
service
agreement,
that
is
the
agreement
between
health
plan
and
medical
group,
the
trust
agreement
was
entered
into.
it
was
actually
signed
about
december
30,
1959,
but
it
was
effective
as
of
july
1,
1959,
the
date
when
the
agreement
between
health
services
and
medical
group
became
effective
and
nothing
turns
on
the
fact
that
there
was
some
delay
and
working
out
and
finally
signing
the
trust
agreement.
as
i’ve
already
indicated
the
trust
agreement
is
entitled
retirement
plan
for
the
permanente
medical
group.
and
it
is
a
typical
non-vested
retirement
trust.
it
provides
for
benefits
only
to
physicians,
but
it
includes
not
only
the
partners
in
medical
group,
but
also
physicians
who
are
employees
of
the
group.
it
provides
for
tentative
credits
for
each
physician
based
upon
his
age,
experience,
and
length
of
service.
it
provides
that
these
credits
may
be
forfeited
if
the
physician
leaves
the
partnership
or
its
employee
except
under
certain
circumstances.
in
that
event,
the
forfeited
amounts
are
creditable
to
the
other
physicians
who
are
beneficiaries
of
the
trust.
as
the
respondents
here
agree
and
expressly
stated
page
4
of
their
brief,
in
no
event
is
any
amount
refundable
to
health
plan.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
we
get
to
that
question
only
if
we
assume
that
the
payments
are
income
to
the
trust,
but
if
it
is
decided
as
we
contend
that
the
payments
are
always
income
to
medical
group
then
it
simply
becomes
a
question
of
what
is
the
distributable
share
of
each
partners’
income
in
the
trust
each
year.
and
the
payment
to
the
trust
we
contend
is
income
to
the
medical
group
partnership
and
it’s
a
part
of
the
income
which
must
be
shown
on
the
information
return
of
the
partnership
and
allocated
to
the
partners
and
proportion
to
their
interest
in
the
partnership
income.
in
that
so,
what
happens
to
any
particular
physicians
interest
and
a
trust
is
an
irrelevant
as
far
as
this
case
is
concern.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice.
he
simply
has
a
--
perhaps
a
reduced
income
from
the
trust
which
will
affect
him.
but
this
is
from
point
of
view
of
the
tax
law
as
we
contend
the
same
as
if
the
payment
was
made
to
medical
group
and
medical
group
then
made
a
payment
to
the
retirement
trust.
that
would
not
be
income
to
the
partnership
when
it
was
paid
to
the
retirement
--
to
the
partner
when
it
was
paid
to
the
retirement
trust
and
it
would
not
be
a
loss
to
the
partner
when
it
--if
he
had
a
forfeiture.
i
think
this
all
turns
on
the
somewhat
subtle
but
nevertheless
controlling
issue
in
this
case,
are
these
payments
income
to
the
medical
group
which
we
contend
they
are
or
are
they
income
to
the
partnership
--
to
the
retirement
trust
which
is
the
basis
which
the
court
below
decided?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
that
depends
on
–
in
the
first
place,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
about
this
or
whatever.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
taking
--
taking
a
typical
one
if
the
retirement
plan
is
for
employees
and
if
it
is
nondiscriminatory
so
that
it
meets
the
standards
of
section
401
and
following
of
the
internal
revenue
code
then
amounts
paid
into
it
would
be
deductible
by
medical
plan
and
would
not
be
taxable
to
the
employees
until
they
were
paid
out
to
the
employees.
this
plan
is
quite
clearly,
not
within
section
401.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
discriminatory
because
it
applies
only
to
the
top-salaried
people,
the
physicians,
but
even
more
clearly,
it
is
not
exclusively
for
employees
and
their
beneficiaries
which
are
the
only
things
to
which
the
retirement
trust
provisions
in
section
401
apply.
in
the
years
involved
here,
at
least
1960,
1961,
there
was
no
provision
whatever
in
the
law
for
a
retirement,
deduction
of
retirement
benefits
for
self-employed
persons
and
partners
are
of
course
self-employed
persons
as
partners
in
law
offices
have
known
with
respect
to
the
tax
law
for
a
long
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
that’s
exactly
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
may
--
he
may
mr.
justice
have
a
perhaps
even
an
ordinary
loss.
he
may
have
a
deduction
for
a
loss.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
--
this
record
for
determining
that
and
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
as
to
that
loss
except
as
it
bears
on
the
remaining
problem.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
would
surely
--
it
would
certainly
increase
his
basis
in
the
partnership.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
certainly
increases
basis
in
the
partnership.
indeed,
there
has
been
confusion
in
this
case
about
this
and
it
is
a
complicated
case.
let
me
point
out
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
my
answer
was
quite
and
adequate
and
perhaps
illustrates
the
difficulty
of
the
case
to
one
who
has
been
working
on
it
for
months.
it
is
quite
plain
that
the
increase
in
income,
not
offset
by
a
corresponding
withdrawal
of
funds
from
the
partnership
would
increase
each
partner’s
basis
in
the
partnership
and
would
be
taken
into
account
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
probably,
it
matters
due
from
the
partnership.
incidentally,
in
the
foldout,
just
before
page
203
is
the
computation
of
the
amounts
allocated
to
each
partner
in
this
case
by
the
revenue
agent.
and
i
think
this
illustrates
the
same
thing
because
i
believe
that
there
was
an
error
by
the
revenue
agent
in
calculating
the
deficiencies
because
he
apparently
allocated
the
payments
--
payment
to
the
trust
on
the
basis
of
the
retirement
formula
in
the
trust.
but
the
payment
should
have
been
allocated
only
to
partners
and
to
partners
on
a
pro-rata
basis
since
that
it
is
the
way
that
all
earnings
and
excess
of
withdrawing
accounts
were
distributable
under
the
partnership
agreement.
now
this
question
is
covered
by
paragraph
24
of
the
stipulation
at
page
87
down
at
the
bottom.
the
partners
agree
--
the
parties
agree
that
any
recomputations
of
the
various
sums
involved
in
these
actions
which
may
be
required
by
court’s
adjudication
herein
will
be
made,
verified,
and
settled
by
counsel.
and
i’m
--
i
feel
fairly
confident
that
after
this
court’s
decision
that
can
be
done.
but
in
the
event,
that
counsel
cannot
agree
upon
such
recomputations.
the
sums
may
be
settled
by
the
court
upon
application
in
10
days
notice.
and
i
mentioned
this
because
it
may
be
what
through
the
court
below
of
the
track,
same
way
that
i
think
i
was
throwing
off
the
track
and
i
would
like
to
avoid
suggesting
the
same
error
here.
this
case
can
be
made
to
appear
and
very
likely
is,
very
complicated.
there
is
even
a
considerable
discussion
in
the
respondent’s
brief
to
the
effect
that
the
government
is
preceding
on
the
entity
theory
of
partnerships
while
they
said
that
the
conduit
theory
is
applicable.
it
seems
odd
that
we
should
still
be
discussing
such
things
in
1972.
i
think
it
is
by
now
accepted
that
partnerships
are
both
entities
and
aggregates
and
are
so
treated
in
the
tax
law.
they
are
treated
as
entities
were
the
purpose
of
filing
information
returns,
but
partnerships
are
not
taxed
under
our
law
and
never
have
been.
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
partners.
they
are
not
taxed
on
their
income
actually
received
from
the
partnership,
what
they
are
taxed
on
is
their
distributive
share
of
the
partnership
income
whether
they
received
or
not.
i
don’t
want
to
oversimplify
this
case,
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
question
at
issue
here
was
resolved
many
years
ago,
and
that
the
case
on
careful
examination
involves
no
question
which
has
not
been
long
established
in
our
tax
law.
the
first
of
two
cases
is
the
venerable
classic,
lucas
against
earl
decided
in
1930.
in
an
opinion
by
justice
holmes,
that
case
involved
an
agreement
between
a
husband
and
wife
under
which
the
income
of
the
husband
became
a
joint
property
of
both
spouses.
it
was
contended
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
income
was
taxable
half
to
the
husband
and
half
to
the
wife.
but
this
court
reversed
justice
holmes
and
his
one
own
opinion
said
that,
“this
case
is
not
to
be
decided
by
attenuated
subtleties.
there
is
doubt
that
the
statute
could
tax
salaries
to
those
who
earned
them
and
provide
that
the
tax
could
not
be
escaped
by
anticipatory
arrangements
and
contracts,
however,
skillfully
devised
to
prevent
the
salary
when
paid
from
vesting
even
for
a
second
in
the
man
who
earned
it.”
that
seems
to
us
the
import
of
the
statute
before
us
and
we
think
that
no
distinction
can
be
taken
according
to
the
motives
leading
to
the
arrangement
by
which
the
fruits
are
attributed
to
a
different
tree
on
that
from
which
they
grew.”
in
the
other
case
in
heiner
and
mellon
in
304
u.s.
that
involved
a
partnership
and
involved
income
which
under
the
applicable
state
law
could
not
be
paid
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
nevertheless
income
to
the
partnership
and
came
within
the
distributive
share.
let
me
turn
to
a
hypothetical
example.
let’s
assume
a
large
law
firm
with
a
hundred
or
more
partners
and
his
many
associates.
for
convenience,
i’ll
call
it
ropes
and
cromwell.
let
us
assume
that
it
has
a
large
and
important
client
which
we’ll
call
international
conglomerates,
inc.
the
client
has
worldwide
operations
and
it’s
constantly
confronted
with
legal
problems.
it
has
its
own
legal
staff
whether
it
relays
heavenly
on
the
services
provided
by
ropes
and
cromwell.
international
conglomerates
is
much
interested
in
the
continuity
of
the
services
of
the
individual
members
of
ropes
and
cromwell.
in
the
past,
ropes
and
cromwell
has
billed
at
appropriate
intervals
and
these
have
been
paid.
now,
let
us
suppose
that
ropes
and
cromwell
suggested
the
corporation
that
hereafter
10%
of
the
bill
be
paid
to
the
law
firm’s
retirement
fund.
obviously
enough,
this
would
make
no
difference
under
lucas
and
earl,
and
the
culbertson
case,
the
entire
amount
would
be
taxable
to
the
partnership.
i
don’t
think
it
would
make
any
difference
that
the
law
firm’s
retirement
fund
was
a
non-vested
one
under
which
no
partner
had
any
immediate
right.
the
payment
to
the
retirement
plan
would
still
be
income
to
the
partnership
of
ropes
and
cromwell
because
it
is
a
payment
made
on
account
of
services
rendered
by
the
partnership
and
taxable
to
the
partnership
under
lucas
and
earl.
well
now,
let
us
suppose
that
instead
of
a
payment
to
the
firm’s
retirement
fund,
the
payments
made
to
a
trust
for
such
of
the
wives
of
the
partners
at
ropes
and
cromwell
as
survived
the
partners.
here,
no
partner
would
have
any
right
to
receive
any
specific
amount.
i
suggest
though
that
the
payment
would
still
be
clearly
income
to
the
partnership.
and
finally,
let
us
assume
that
international
conglomerates
came
to
ropes
and
cromwell
and
said,
“we
are
very
much
interested
in
the
continuity
of
your
firm
and
then
encouraging
people
to
stay
here
in
order
that
they
may
have
background
and
experience
in
our
work.
with
the
result
that
when
we
have
a
problem,
we
may
go
to
someone
who
already
knows
a
great
deal
about
our
business
and
the
way
we
operate.
accordingly,
we
want
to
join
with
you
in
the
establishing
a
non-vested
pension
plan
under
which
we
will
make
regular
annual
payments
and
the
plan
will
eventually
provide
retirement
payments,
but
only
to
those
members,
employees
of
the
firm
who
satisfied
length
of
service
requirements.”
but
it
seems
to
me
is
what
we
have
here
putting
the
respondent’s
case
in
its
strongest
terms,
but
such
a
payment
would
still
be
a
payment
by
international
conglomerates,
inc.
on
account
of
services
rendered
by
ropes
and
cromwell
and
would
thus,
under
lucas
and
earl,
and
culbertson
be
income
to
ropes
and
cromwell.
since
it
is
income
to
ropes
and
cromwell,
each
partner
of
ropes
and
cromwell
would
be
taxable
on
his
distributive
share
of
that
income,
whether
distributed
or
not
and
even
though
it
could
not
be
distributed
as
this
court
held
in
heiner
and
mellon.
in
this
case,
the
payments
made
to
the
retirement
fund
by
health
plan
were
made
on
account
of
the
services
rendered
by
medical
group
and
pursuant
to
the
compensation
contract
between
health
plan
and
medical
group,
which
specifically
provided
for
the
payment
of
this
retirement
amounts
as
part
of
the
compensation,
that’s
in
quotation
mark
“payable
to
medical
group,
for
medical
services
to
be
provided
my
medical
group
hereunder.”
the
whole
point
here
is
that
payments
are
income
to
the
partnership
which
performed
the
services.
we
do
not
get
to
the
question
of
the
right
to
receive
payments
from
the
retirement
trust
until
the
payments
made
by
the
health
plan
for
the
services
of
medical
group
are
treated
as
income
to
the
retirement
trust,
but
the
payments
are
not
income
to
the
retirement
trust,
they
are
income
to
medical
group
under
the
clear
teaching
of
lucas
against
earl.
and
since
the
payments
are
income
to
medical
group,
it
does
not
matter
that
the
partnership
medical
group
by
its
contract
cost
these
amounts
to
be
payable
to
the
retirement
fund
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
had
an
immediate
vested
right
to
get
cash
and
no
partner
could
currently
receive
his
share.
in
this
respect,
the
situation
is
like
that
in
other
good
old
case,
griffiths
against
the
commissioner,
where
the
court
held
that
the
taxability
of
the
income
currently
could
not
be
defeated
despite
the
technically
elegant
arrangement
which
had
been
set
up
to
divert
the
taxability.
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
indicated
since
the
diversion
of
earned
income
that
is
the
amounts
paid
pursuant
to
a
contract
for
personal
services
rendered
runs
directly
follow
that
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
income
taxation
that
earned
income
is
taxable
to
him
who
earns
it,
no
matter
what
diversionary
arrangements
is
made
for
its
payment.
the
decision
below
is
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
