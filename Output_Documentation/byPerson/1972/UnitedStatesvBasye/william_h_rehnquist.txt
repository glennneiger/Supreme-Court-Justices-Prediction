mr.

i

that
the
stability

would
benefit
medical

as

wouldn’t

justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
brookes,
let’s
get
back
to
just
a
moment
for
the
line
of
question
of
the
chief
justice
was
pursuing
on.
in
paragraph
16
of
the
stipulation
on
page
84
of
the
record
which
you
had
earlier
read
to
us,
the
last
sentence
there,
that
the
payments
which
health
plan
agreed
to
and
did
make
to
the
trust
were
made
solely
to
fund
the
retirement
plan.
we
are
not,
otherwise,
available
to
medical
group
or
to
the
individual
members
or
employees
there.
it
seems
to
me
a
natural
reading
of
that
last
sentence
would
mean
that
the
funds
after
paid
to
the
retirement
plan
were
not
otherwise
available.
are
you
suggesting
that
that
means
that
health
plan
would
not
have
made
these
payments
in
any
other
form
than
as
a
payment
to
the
retirement
plan?
