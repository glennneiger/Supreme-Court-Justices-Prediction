mr.
solicitor

if
a
physician’s
interest
a
partner
physician’s
interest
is
forfeited
then
i
think
take
it
the
internal
revenue
service
in
some
way
would
recognize
the
extent
of
his,
shall
i
call
it
loss
at
that
time
in
the
year
of
forfeiture?
justice
potter
stewart
that
i
understand,
but
i
wondered
whether
he
doesn’t
have
a
loss
of
some
kind
at
the
time
of
forfeiture
that
might
be
assertable?

depreciable?

any
of
the
property
that
was

invested
figured
in
the
distributive
