unknown

mr.
solicitor
general,
i
take
it
that
--
that
government’s
theory
is
that
the
money
is
paid
to
the
trust
and
it’s
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
partnership
and
his
income
to
it.
unknown
speaker
now
--
and
it
is
--
and
it
would
--
the
individual
partner
would
only
actually
benefit
by
it
if
he
doesn’t
leave
the
partnership
and
retires
pursuant
to
the
plan.
at
the
time,
he
--
he
takes
--
at
the
time
he
does
something
that
is
also
in
the
profit
shared.
he
already
had
paid
taxes
on
a
certain
amount
of
money
that
was
income
to
the
partnership
and
that
is
now
in
the
trust.
doesn’t
he,
when
he
leaves
the
partnership,
resigns
or
something,
he
has
no
any
kind
of
a
capital
loss?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
would
be
a
very
odd
situation
in
the
tax
law
wouldn’t
it,
if
you
pay
taxes
on
some
income
and
it
does
not
even
outdo
your
basis
on
some
property?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
--
this
was
my
question
and
perhaps
i
didn’t
phrase
it
very
well,
but
it
seem
to
me
that
on
a
government
theory,
if
there
is
taxability
to
the
partnership
enhanced
to
the
underlying
partners
that
there
had
to
be
some
kind
of
a
deduction
eventually
in
the
event
of
departure
from
the
partnership
and
forfeiture?
unknown
speaker
does
this
qualify
the
buildings
that
he
can’t
take
away
with
it
--?
unknown
speaker
mr.
brookes,
if
the
medical
partnership
was
to
receive
the
$100,000
a
year.
health
plan
said,
“we’ll
give
you,
we’ll
pay
you
the
$100,000
but
we
will
also
pay
$25,000
because
there’s
some
particular
benefit
we
want,
health
plan
wants
to
the
retirement
fund.
is
that
what
the
argument
is?”
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i
gather
the
argument
is
a
$100,000
would
be
income
--
unknown
speaker
--
but
the
$25,000,
the
parties
agreed
should
not
be
income
because
it
was
not
to
be
paid
for
medical
service?
unknown
speaker
on
your
theory,
when
is,
if
ever,
anything
taxable
to
the
partners?
unknown
speaker
does
your
approach
in
your
analysis
of
these
facts
tie
in
with
the
history
of
the
permanente
group
and
health
plan.
weren’t
they
born
out
of
the
same
ball
of
wax
originally?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
two
organizations,
health
plan
and
the
medical
group
are
just
came
together
by
accident?
unknown
speaker
it’s
a
very
--
it’s
a
very
celebrated
development
in
medical
practice
of
course
in
california.
unknown
speaker
you’re
suggesting
the
court
might
find
it
does,
but
you’re
not
getting
any
--
unknown
speaker
of
course
in
lucas
against
earl,
you
didn’t
have
the
added
ingredient
of
a
partnership.
unknown
speaker
have
you
answered
the
justice’s
questions?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
a
partnership
gets
$200
on
income,
a
$100
of
it
they
distributed
to
the
partners,
a
$100.00
of
it
they
put
into
physical,
they
buy
a
chair
with
it.
unknown
speaker
it’s
all
distributed.
that’s
all
taxable
to
the
individual
partner.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
but
nevertheless
the
amount
the
partnership
puts
into
the
chair
is
taxable
to
the
partner?
unknown
speaker
they
do
50-50
partners.
unknown
speaker
and
they
buy
a
$100
chair
and
they
have
to
--
although
they
had
$200
of
otherwise
net
income,
they
each
have
a
distributive
share
that
year
of
a
$100,
wouldn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
and
each
would,
and
the
partnership
would
own
a
$100
chair,
that
would
be
depreciable
over
its
expected
life.
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
differ?
unknown
speaker
because
they
have
agreed
not
to.

that
