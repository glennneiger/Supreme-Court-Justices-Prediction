mr.
valentine
brookes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
to
a
substantial
extent
the
solicitor
general
who
has
argued
another
case
than
the
one
before
you.
let
me
first
refer
to
his
example
about
the
mythical
law
firm
of
ropes
and
cromwell.
he
suggested
that
the
facts
there
were
that
the
law
firm
suggested
the
10%
of
what
had
been
its
normal
retainer
should
be
paid
to
a
trust
which
was
to
establish
a
retirement
plan.
let
me
read
you
what
the
party
stipulated
in
this
case.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
is
on
page
83
of
the
record,
your
honor
and
it
is
in
the
stipulation
of
facts.
it
will
also
be
--
it
will
also
appear
virtually
in
haec
verba
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
on
page
32
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
stipulation
is
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
retirement
plan
was
to
create
an
incentive
for
physicians
to
remain
with
medical
group
or
other
groups
of
physicians
contracting
to
serve
health
plan
members
and
thus
to
ensure
health
plan,
that
it
would
have
a
stable
and
reliable
group
of
physicians
providing
medical
services
to
its
members
and
so
on.
then
it
states
that
the
retirement
plan
was
patterned
after
one
which
was
in
effect
already
in
southern
california
between
another
medical
group
and
the
same
health
plan.
and
finally,
that
the
payments
which
health
plan
agreed
to
and
did
make
to
the
plan
were
paid
solely
to
fund
the
retirement
plan
and
were
not
otherwise
available
to
medical
group
or
to
the
individual
members
or
employees
thereof.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
seek
to
make
use
of
the
initiative
was
taken
by
health
plan
in
which
for
its
benefit
according
to
the
stipulation
and
it
was
so
understood
by
both
courts
below.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
more
of
a
voluminous
and
it
speaks
of
the
facts
more
freely
than
the
district
court
does.
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
in
the
district
court
other
than
the
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
--
which
in
the
opinion
will
appear
at
page
32
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
again,
i
might
make
quotations
from
page
39
of
the
petition.
this
is
the
appendix
to
the
petition
and
in
that
case
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
shift
of
pages.
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
primary
purpose
of
the
retirement
plan
as
to
ensure
kaiser
a
stable
and
reliable
pool
of
physicians
providing
medical
service
to
its
members.
the
plan
accomplishes
this
purpose
by
creating
an
incentive
for
physicians
to
devote
their
careers
to
kaiser
members
and
so
on.
now,
this
is
virtually
from
the
stipulation
in
haec
verba.
but
then
at
page
39
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
court
interprets
that
language
again.
in
distinguishing
a
circuit
court
case,
hulbert
which
had
been
cited
by
the
government
below,
the
court
said
that
hulbert
was
not
in
point
because
there
the
partnership
had
it
chosen
not
to
enter
the
sales
agreement
or
had
it
entered
a
different
one
on
different
terms
would
have
received
the
whole
of
the
payments
as
current
income.
in
this
case,
and
i
am
quoting
the
court
of
appeals,
“the
party
stipulated
that
the
payments
which
kaiser
agreed
to
and
did
make
to
the
trust
were
paid
solely
to
fund
the
retirement
plan
and
were
not
otherwise
available
to
permanente,
that’s
the
partnership,
or
to
the
individual
members
or
employees
thereof.
then
turning
to
the
next
page.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
hypothetical
which
the
solicitor
general
suggested,
he
suggested
that
the
law
firm
made
the
suggestion
to
its
client
that
a
portion
of
what
had
thereto
for
been
paid
as
the
retainer,
10%
should
be
paid
into
a
retirement
fund
and
become
deferred
income.
the
stipulation
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
by
me,
says
that
this
is
not
what
happened
there,
that
this
money
that
was
paid
into
the
trust
would
not
otherwise
have
been
available.
it
would
not
otherwise
have
been
paid
for
the
benefit
of
the
partners
and
their
employees
and
--
mr.
valentine
brookes
i
think
the
answer
is
that
probably
the
result
is
the
same
in
either
case,
your
honor.
but
i
do
wish
the
facts
to
be
before
the
court.
and
if
they
do,
if
these
two
different
thrusts
of
initiative
do
make
a
difference
then
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
decided
the
case
on
an
understanding
of
the
facts
which
it
drew
from
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
was
to
the
effect
that
the
initiative
here
came
from
health
plan
rather
than
from
the
partnership.
and
the
partnership
did
not
ask
health
plan
to
take
some
of
the
current
earnings
it
would
otherwise
have
received
and
defer
them.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
cases
which
we
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
which
hold
that
this
initiative,
the
question
of
who
suggested
the
deferment
is
irrelevant.
the
cases
that
i
refer
to
involved
what
we
call
a
non-funded
plans.
this
is
where
the
employer
merely
refrains
from
paying
sums
to
the
employee,
holds
them
in
its
treasury
and
pays
them
later
at
some
time
agreed
upon
by
the
party.
this
is
a
type
of
retirement
fund.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
not
solely
from
that
language
however.
and
incidentally,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
interpretation
which
i
am
urging
which
is
drawn
in
part
from
the
language
earlier
in
paragraph
16
which
starts
out
by
saying,
“the
primary
purpose
of
the
retirement
plan
was
to
create
an
incentive
for
physicians
to
remain
with
the
medical
group,
and
then
in
omitting
some
words,
to
ensure
health
plan
that
it
would
have
a
stable
and
reliable
group
of
physicians
providing
medical
service.”
mr.
valentine
brookes
this
is
what
i
have
just
stated.
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
not
my
only
argument.
however,
i
am
seeking
to
get
the
facts
before
the
court.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
it
would.
mr.
valentine
brookes
no,
your
honor.
my
point
is,
it
would
not
be
that
the
parties
would
so
agree,
but
rather
i
would
turn
to
the
substance
of
their
agreement.
and
this
gets
too
far
as
the
most
critical
point
in
this
case
in
my
opinion
which
is
that
as
to
the
taxpayers,
the
amounts
paid
into
the
trust
were
wholly
contingent
and
forfeitable.
they
had
no
enforceable
right
to
them
until
the
lapse
of
conditions
which
had
not
occurred
at
this
time.
they
must
either
serve
15
years
or
serve
10
years
and
become
65
before
any
of
their
accounts
seems
to
be
tentative.
but
even
after
the
attainment
of
these
conditions,
they
must
continue
to
make
themselves
available
even
after
retirement.
for
consultation
purposes
and
refrain
from
competition.
if
they
fail
to
live
up
to
those
conditions
then
too,
they
forfeit
even
though
their
payments
had
began
up
to
the
time
of
the
second
type
of
conditions
of
forfeiture.
mr.
valentine
brookes
when
they
get
it,
your
honor.
mr.
valentine
brookes
oh,
i
think
not
except
in
the
most
general
way,
your
honor.
there
had
been
a
predecessor
partnership.
health
plan
had
been
in
existence
for
years
prior
to
the
execution
of
any
of
the
contracts
that
are
on
the
record
here.
indeed,
it
entered
into
the
employment
agreement
if
i
may
so
term
it
with
the
partnership,
six
months
before
the
establishment
of
the
funded
plan.
so
there
was
a
period
of
six
months
in
which
it
was
contemplated.
there
might
be
such
a
plan
but
it
was
not
in
being
and
yet
the
physicians
were
working
under
the
partnership
agreement
and
the
other
agreement
with
health
plan.
these
were
not,
however
simultaneously
born.
mr.
valentine
brookes
no,
i
am
not
your
honor.
the
health
plan
was
established
by
a
funding
of
a
large
sum
from
prominent
california
family
for
the
purpose
of
providing
prepaid
low
cost
medical
care
on
a
nonprofit
basis.
it
existed.
it
had
--hospitals
acquired
more,
they
found
that
it
couldn’t
operate
them
without
physicians.
it
also
found
that
it
could
not
balance
the
budget
if
outside
physicians
selected
by
the
patients
were
employed
at
normal
fee
rates,
so
it
became
necessary
to
establish
a
relationship
with
the
group
of
physicians
who
would
provide
it
exclusively
with
their
services.
it
is
the
outgrowth
of
the
years
of
experience
which
has
produced
the
documents
and
the
record
here.
there
was
a
prior
partnership
agreement.
the
one
before
you
was
entered
into
a
1959
and
the
record
does
not
state
how
long
back
in
the
history
the
prior
relationship
of
health
plan
with
other
partnerships
had
been
created.
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
valentine
brookes
and
so
it
is
mr.
justice.
and
the
essential
key
to
its
success
is
the
availability
of
the
group
of
physicians
under
the
exclusivity
conditions
which
exists
here.
the
court
below
used
the
language
exclusivity.
it
was
not
original
with
me.
i
am
borrowing
their
language
and
it
is
exclusive
in
both
directions.
that
is
to
save
health
plan
contracts
to
have
the
medical
services
performed
exclusively
by
the
physicians
who
are
either
partners
of
or
employees
of
the
partnership.
and
in
turn,
the
partnership
contracts
that
its
partners
and
its
employees
will
perform
services
--
no
services
for
any
other
health
plan
but
this
one.
there’s
a
limited
provision
for
their
having
private
practice
in
which
case
there
earnings
go
into
the
partnership
as
well
but
their
private
practice
is
not
permitted
to
interfere
with
their
employment
or
their
services
for
health
plan
because
they
must
provide
their
full
time
or
the
equivalent
thereof
for
health
plan.
the
court
of
appeals
in
further
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
to
whether
i
correctly
interpret
that
one
sentence
in
the
stipulation
isolated
from
the
balance
of
the
stipulation.
so
that
the
agreement
provides
that
kaiser’s
contributions
to
the
plan
are
to
be
in
addition
to
all
other
sums
payable
by
kaiser.
thus,
had
permanente
elected
not
to
establish
the
retirement
plan,
it
could
not
have
received
additional
current
income.
it
then
states,
there
--
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record,
this
is
at
page
40
of
the
opinion,
rather
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
permanente
agreed
to
accept
less
direct
compensation
from
kaiser
in
exchange
for
the
retirement
plan
payments.
that
kaiser
would
not
have
been
willing
to
make
the
payments
except
into
the
trusts
under
the
conditions
imposed
is
consistent
with
the
primary
purpose
of
the
retirement
plan
to
ensure
kaiser
a
stable
and
reliable
group
of
physicians.
we
therefore
conclude
that
permanente,
there
is
a
deletion
at
this
point
mr.
chief
justice.
we
therefore
conclude
that
permanente
never
having
had
the
right
to
receive
the
income
could
not
have
diverted
it
to
others.
this,
i
believe
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
hypothetical
of
the
law
firm
that
was
assumed
for
argument
purposes
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
valentine
brookes
mr.
justice
i
am
glad
you
gave
me
the
chance,
the
opportunity
of
making
that
clear.
i
do
not
concede
that
that
different,
that
the
case
depends
upon
that
difference.
my
case
is
--
mr.
valentine
brookes
the
court
might
still
find
it
and
i
think
also.
this
--
the
difference
make
create
a
climate
for
the
approach
to
the
case.
and
i
would
like
that
climate
which
i
considered
to
be
somewhat
adverse
to
be
removed.
the
law
probably
makes
no
difference,
no
distinction.
the
rules
are
quite
clear
in
the
case
of
the
status
of
employees
or
independent
contractors
that
the
result
that
we
argue
for
would
follow
because
their
interests
in
the
retirement
payments
are
entirely
profitable
and
contingent.
even
in
the
event
of
a
nonqualified
plan
where
there
are
employees,
congress
has
stated
its
policy
and
its
policy
is
with
a
funded
but
nonqualified
plan.
this
is
a
funded
plan
and
a
nonqualified
plan.
the
payments
by
the
employer
to
the
trust
or
into
the
fund
are
not
current
income
to
the
employee
if
their
rights
are
non-forfeitable
at
the
time
that
the
payments
were
made,
section
402
(b)
of
the
code
so
states.
we
can
not
claim
that
we
come
under
the
umbrella
of
that
section
because
we
are
independent
contractors.
we
are
not
the
employees.
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
physicians
are
employees
but
they
are
employees
of
the
partnership
and
paradoxically,
the
government
does
not
seek
to
tax
them.
on
the
contrary,
it
seeks
to
tax
the
amounts
paid
to
the
retirement
fund
for
their
possible
future
benefit
to
the
partners
and
would
allow
the
partners
no
deduction
for
the
amounts
that
are
actually
potentially
receivable
by
the
employees.
and
the
paradox
becomes
complete.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
so
works
out
this
plan
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
ultimately
the
only
beneficiaries
will
be
the
employees.
if
the
partners
all
peel
off
one
by
one
and
leave
no
one
but
those
persons
who
are
presently
employees
as
participants
in
the
plan,
all
forfeitures
go
to
the
benefit
of
those
remaining
in
the
plan
and
i
have
indicated
the
hypothesis
that
they
are
employees.
they
may
later
become
partners
but
at
this
time
they
are
employees
and
may
be
the
sole
beneficiaries.
mr.
valentine
brookes
no,
your
honor.
we
seek
to
rely
up
on
the
statute.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
government’s
position
based
upon
lucas
against
earl
is
some
because
it
is
not
derived
from
the
statute.
lucas
against
earl
is
certainly
a
distinguished
and
important
case
but
to
illustrate,
your
honor,
how
statutes
may
change
what
has
been
the
law
in
the
past.
if
mr.
earl
is
still
alive,
he
can
derive
the
benefits
from
the
statute
which
he
could
not
derive
under
the
method
he
attempted
in
lucas
against
earl
because
all
he
needs
to
do
now
is
file
a
joint
return
with
his
wife
and
he
would
get
the
split
income
benefits
that
he
sought
by
the
devise
that
was
denied
to
him.
so
statutes
do
change
things
and
we
rely
upon
the
statutes,
and
we
have
discussed
this
as
a
considerable
length
in
our
brief
and
i
would
like
--
it’s
difficult
to
discuss
a
statute
in
all
oral
argument
without
the
statute
before
you.
but
i
--
this
is
not
such
a
conflict
statute
as
that.
first,
the
section
701
which
appears
in
the
appendix
to
respondent’s
brief
which
is
to
white
one,
it
appears
at
page
3
of
the
appendix.
the
appendix
is
separated
from
the
rest
by
a
blue
insert
sheet.
it
says
that
a
partnership
as
such
shall
not
be
subject
to
the
income
tax.
persons
carrying
on
business
as
partners
shall
be
liable
for
income
tax
only
in
their
separate
or
individual
capacities.
the
point
that
we
see
in
that
section
is
that
congress
is
thinking
of
a
partnership
not
as
an
entity
conducting
business
but
rather
as
an
aggregate
of
individuals,
of
persons
carrying
on
business
as
partners.
it
is
consistent
with
that
trust
that
emphasis
that
section
703
which
appears
on
page
5
of
our
appendix
says
that
the
taxable
income
of
a
partnership
shall
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
case
of
an
individual
except
that
and
none
of
the
exceptions
is
applicable
here
and
the
government
has
never
contended
that
any
of
them
was
applicable
here.
so
it
says
that
the
taxable
income
of
a
partnership
shall
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
case
of
an
individual.
there
history
behind
these
projections.
they
are
derived
--
the
ones
which
--
the
language
which
i
have
read
is
derived
without
significant
change
from
the
prior
code.
this
court
construed
the
prior
code
in
neuberger
to
adopt
the
context
then
before
it,
the
aggregate
theory
rather
than
the
entity
theory.
there
are
lots
of
words
used
for
these
theories
and
there
the
court
used
both
the
entity
language
and
the
unit
language.
and
it
also
referred
to
the
partnership
as
an
association
of
individuals.
and
it
allowed
a
partner
to
offset
his
individual
non-capital
losses
against
his
share
of
the
partnership’s
non-capital
losses
even
though
the
statutes
could
more
readily
who
have
been
construed
in
the
other
way
under
the
doctrine
of
ejusdem
generis
which
the
court
refused
to
apply
because
it
thought
and
i
“that
congress
has
recognize
the
partnership
both
as
a
business
unit
and
as
an
association
of
individuals.”
but
they
said
this
weakens
rather
than
strengthens
the
government’s
argument
that
the
privileges
are
distinct
and
that
the
unit
characteristics
of
the
partnership
must
be
emphasized.
and
interestingly,
at
that
point
they
cited
among
the
cases
a
case
from
the
court
of
claims
that
craik
case.
and
the
craik
case
involved
a
nonresident
who
was
a
member
of
the
resident
partnership.
the
question
was
whether
he
was
taxable
upon
the
entire
distributive
share
of
his
income
of
the
partnership
or
merely
a
portion
of
it.
some
of
the
partnership
income
was
also
from
foreign
sources
as
he
resided
abroad.
and
the
court
of
claims
used
the
language
undoubtedly
referred
to
by
this
court
in
referring
to
the
craik
case
that
at
common
law,
each
partner
was
the
agent
for
the
other
partners
in
carrying
up
their
common
purpose.
the
income
earned
by
the
partnership
was
regarded
as
having
been
earned
by
the
individual
partners
either
by
himself
individually
or
through
his
agents,
the
other
partners.
the
court
below
used
the
term
that
the
partnership
was
acting
only
as
the
agent
of
its
members
and
it
used
that
in
this
context,
in
this
sense,
in
the
petition
and
in
the
brief,
both
the
government
has
sought
to
make
capital
of
the
use
of
the
term
agent.
but
this
is
the
classical
concept
of
the
relationship
of
one
partner
to
the
other.
and
in
the
craik
case
which
this
court
spoke
of
approvingly
in
neuberger.
the
court
did
say
that
each
partner
was
regarded
as
having
earned
the
income.
the
statute
says
that
in
section
701
that
the
businesses
done
by
individuals
or
by
persons
doing
business
in
the
form
of
a
partnership
and
it
shows
that
the
income
of
the
partnership
shall
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
case
of
an
individual.
if
those
instructions
are
applied
then
we
see
that
the
fact
that
the
payments
into
the
trust
by
health
plan
create
only
forfeitable
and
contingent
rights
and
the
taxpayers
is
controlling.
under
volumes
of
doctrine
including
many
decisions
from
this
court
whether
on
the
cash
or
the
accrual
basis,
a
taxpayer
does
not
have
income
so
long
as
his
claims
to
whatever
the
property
is
remained
contingent
and
forfeitable.
that
rule
has
been
applied
consistently
in
deferred
compensation
cases.
lucas
against
earl
has
never
been
applied
in
deferred
compensation
cases.
it
has
been
cited
by
the
government
time
after
time
in
deferred
compensation
cases
as
it
was
in
both
courts
here
and
it
has
been
rejected
in
all
of
those
cases
including
the
two
courts
below
here.
and
the
reason
is,
mrs.
earl
received
money
in
1921
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
mr.
earl
was
held
taxable
upon
it.
he
was
not
held
taxable
upon
any
income
in
an
earlier
year
before
somebody
received
it.
and
so
it
should
be
here,
these
individuals
should
be
taxable
when
they
receive
their
income
and
not
before.
mr.
valentine
brookes
this
is
true,
your
honor.
the
code
has
a
further
answer
to
the
government’s
position
and
that
is,
it
says,
that
this
is
section
704
it
appears
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
that
the
relevant
part
is
on
page
5.
it’s
the
first
words
of
section
704.
a
partners’
distributive
share
of
income
gain,
loss,
deduction
or
credit
shall
and
so
on
be
determined
by
the
partnership
agreement
then
it
goes
on.
and
i
was
mistaken,
this
is
the
critical
language.
the
partner’s
distributive
share
of
any
item
of
income
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
this
distributive
share
unless
the
agreement
of
the
parties
provides
to
the
contrary.
the
point
is
that
a
partner
is
not
taxable
on
--
inflexibly
on
“x”
percentage
of
the
net
income
of
the
partnership.
it
used
to
be
under
the
old
code.
there’s
a
difference
now.
his
distributive
share
is
of
an
item
of
gross
income
as
well
as
of
net
income.
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
permit
persons
who
attribute
or
contribute
appreciated
property
to
a
partnership.
and
by
a
partnership,
interest
based
on
the
appreciated
value
to
be
the
sole
taxpayers
on
that
appreciated
value
if
the
property
is
sold
for
a
profit.
so
that
the
property
or
the
gain
which
the
partners
have
bought
by
admitting,
the
new
partner
will
not
be
taxable
to
all
of
them
proportionately.
mr.
valentine
brookes
well,
if
it
was
sold.
mr.
valentine
brookes
the
point
of
appreciation
in
value
above
basis
would
be
related
to
the
depreciation
to
be
taken
by
the
partnership
[voice
overlap]
not
to
remember
years.
mr.
valentine
brookes
in
subsequent
years.
now
the
statute
and
the
regulations
recognizes
permit
the
parties
to
vary
the
depreciation
amongst
themselves
so
that
the
depreciation
may
go
to
the
party
who
contributes
the
appreciated
asset
rather
than
being
enjoyed
by
the
partners
who
have
not
contributed
the
appreciated
asset
and
conversely,
in
the
example
i
gave
a
moment
ago,
if
that
property,
that
building
should
be
sold
the
statute
permits
that
partner
to
be
the
one
exclusively
taxable
upon
that
appreciation
which
has
now
become
gain.
so
the
distributive
share
may
be
only
of
one
item
of
gross
income
and
my
point
is
that
a
distributive
share
is
a
proportionate
share.
a
case
the
government
relies
on
heiner
against
mellon
in
so
long.
mr.
valentine
brookes
i
answered
what
i
thought
was
his
question.
mr.
valentine
brookes
oh!
[voice
overlap]
mr.
valentine
brookes
if
i
hear
--
i
did
not
so
understand
the
question.
yes,
your
honor,
so
it
would
be.
but
there
is
nothing
forfeitable
or
contingent.
mr.
valentine
brookes
oh,
yes,
of
course
it
is.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
valentine
brookes
no,
they’re
just
treated
like
an
individual
or
corporate
taxpayer.
there
taxable
income
is
determined
as
if
they
were
individuals
and
if
an
individual
has
income
and
he
buys
a
depreciable
asset,
his
income
is
not
reduced
thereby.
he
gets
depreciation
in
the
future,
so
it
would
be
here.
but
the
point
that
i
am
seeking
to
make
goes
off
from
that,
your
honor
and
it
is
to
allot
the
word
distributive.
the
statute
now
permits
distributive
shares
to
relate
to
items
of
gross
income,
not
merely
to
the
sum
of
net
income.
and
the
word
distributive
was
construed
by
this
court
as
meaning
proportionate.
and
here,
no
partner
knows
what
his
proportion
of
the
chair
of
this
item
of
income
is,
if
it
is
income.
now,
of
course,
we
deny
that
it
is
income.
but
if
it
were
deemed
to
be
income
of
the
partnership,
his
proportionate
share
is
unknown.
it’s
dependent
upon
future
events.
mr.
valentine
brookes
it’s
purchased
from
taxable
income
which
has
come
in
and
should
be
taxed.
this
--
but
there
was
no
deferment
of
receipt
there
mr.
justice
white.
here
there
is
non-receipt,
and
not
only
a
deferment
of
receipt
but
the
contingency
of
possible
non-receipt.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
valentine
brookes
your
honor,
only
if
the
documents
could
be
so
construed
that
medical
plan
have
no
alternative
but
to
do
this.
but
the
fact,
that
that
is
not
the
case
is
very
important
here.
mr.
valentine
brookes
medical
plan
has
never
received
this
income
in
the
case
which
you
have
spoken
of.
medical
plan
had
to
receive
it
but
it
is
obligated
to
do
something
with
it.
the
doctrine
of
receipt
and
non-receipt
is
obviously
important
in
the
income
tax
law.
the
plan
here
came
into
bidding
under
the
thrust
of
the
initiative
of,
let
me
call
it
the
employer,
and
medical
plan
has
no
control
over
it.
now,
i
grant,
your
honor
that
you
have
given
me
a
hypothetical
in
which
they
can
only
do
one
thing
with
it.
they
can
only
pay
it
over
to
a
trust
and
i
assume
the
other
provisions
are
the
same
as
they
are
here
but
they
cannot
get
it
back
except
under
conditions
of
that
possible
forfeiture.
yet,
the
fact
that
they
have
received
it
could
be
regarded
as
all
important.
here
they
have
not
received
anything.
mr.
valentine
brookes
well,
yes,
your
honor.
they
have
agreed
not
to.
mr.
valentine
brookes
the
stipulation
of
facts
may
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
page
84
of
the
record,
it
says,
“no
payments
were
made
to
the
trust
during
the
years
in
question
by
medical
group
or
by
an
individual
or
by
individual
participants
in
the
retirement
plan.”
that
is
the
last
sentence
of
a
paragraph
on
page
84
of
the
record,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
valentine
brookes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
to
a
substantial
extent
the
solicitor
general
who
has
argued
another
case
than
the
one
before
you.
let
me
first
refer
to
his
example
about
the
mythical
law
firm
of
ropes
and
cromwell.
he
suggested
that
the
facts
there
were
that
the
law
firm
suggested
the
10%
of
what
had
been
its
normal
retainer
should
be
paid
to
a
trust
which
was
to
establish
a
retirement
plan.
let
me
read
you
what
the
party
stipulated
in
this
case.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
is
on
page
83
of
the
record,
your
honor
and
it
is
in
the
stipulation
of
facts.
it
will
also
be
--
it
will
also
appear
virtually
in
haec
verba
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
on
page
32
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
stipulation
is
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
retirement
plan
was
to
create
an
incentive
for
physicians
to
remain
with
medical
group
or
other
groups
of
physicians
contracting
to
serve
health
plan
members
and
thus
to
ensure
health
plan,
that
it
would
have
a
stable
and
reliable
group
of
physicians
providing
medical
services
to
its
members
and
so
on.
then
it
states
that
the
retirement
plan
was
patterned
after
one
which
was
in
effect
already
in
southern
california
between
another
medical
group
and
the
same
health
plan.
and
finally,
that
the
payments
which
health
plan
agreed
to
and
did
make
to
the
plan
were
paid
solely
to
fund
the
retirement
plan
and
were
not
otherwise
available
to
medical
group
or
to
the
individual
members
or
employees
thereof.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
seek
to
make
use
of
the
initiative
was
taken
by
health
plan
in
which
for
its
benefit
according
to
the
stipulation
and
it
was
so
understood
by
both
courts
below.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
more
of
a
voluminous
and
it
speaks
of
the
facts
more
freely
than
the
district
court
does.
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
in
the
district
court
other
than
the
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
--
which
in
the
opinion
will
appear
at
page
32
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
again,
i
might
make
quotations
from
page
39
of
the
petition.
this
is
the
appendix
to
the
petition
and
in
that
case
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
shift
of
pages.
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
primary
purpose
of
the
retirement
plan
as
to
ensure
kaiser
a
stable
and
reliable
pool
of
physicians
providing
medical
service
to
its
members.
the
plan
accomplishes
this
purpose
by
creating
an
incentive
for
physicians
to
devote
their
careers
to
kaiser
members
and
so
on.
now,
this
is
virtually
from
the
stipulation
in
haec
verba.
but
then
at
page
39
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
court
interprets
that
language
again.
in
distinguishing
a
circuit
court
case,
hulbert
which
had
been
cited
by
the
government
below,
the
court
said
that
hulbert
was
not
in
point
because
there
the
partnership
had
it
chosen
not
to
enter
the
sales
agreement
or
had
it
entered
a
different
one
on
different
terms
would
have
received
the
whole
of
the
payments
as
current
income.
in
this
case,
and
i
am
quoting
the
court
of
appeals,
“the
party
stipulated
that
the
payments
which
kaiser
agreed
to
and
did
make
to
the
trust
were
paid
solely
to
fund
the
retirement
plan
and
were
not
otherwise
available
to
permanente,
that’s
the
partnership,
or
to
the
individual
members
or
employees
thereof.
then
turning
to
the
next
page.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
hypothetical
which
the
solicitor
general
suggested,
he
suggested
that
the
law
firm
made
the
suggestion
to
its
client
that
a
portion
of
what
had
thereto
for
been
paid
as
the
retainer,
10%
should
be
paid
into
a
retirement
fund
and
become
deferred
income.
the
stipulation
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
by
me,
says
that
this
is
not
what
happened
there,
that
this
money
that
was
paid
into
the
trust
would
not
otherwise
have
been
available.
it
would
not
otherwise
have
been
paid
for
the
benefit
of
the
partners
and
their
employees
and
--
mr.
valentine
brookes
i
think
the
answer
is
that
probably
the
result
is
the
same
in
either
case,
your
honor.
but
i
do
wish
the
facts
to
be
before
the
court.
and
if
they
do,
if
these
two
different
thrusts
of
initiative
do
make
a
difference
then
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
decided
the
case
on
an
understanding
of
the
facts
which
it
drew
from
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
was
to
the
effect
that
the
initiative
here
came
from
health
plan
rather
than
from
the
partnership.
and
the
partnership
did
not
ask
health
plan
to
take
some
of
the
current
earnings
it
would
otherwise
have
received
and
defer
them.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
cases
which
we
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
which
hold
that
this
initiative,
the
question
of
who
suggested
the
deferment
is
irrelevant.
the
cases
that
i
refer
to
involved
what
we
call
a
non-funded
plans.
this
is
where
the
employer
merely
refrains
from
paying
sums
to
the
employee,
holds
them
in
its
treasury
and
pays
them
later
at
some
time
agreed
upon
by
the
party.
this
is
a
type
of
retirement
fund.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
not
solely
from
that
language
however.
and
incidentally,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
interpretation
which
i
am
urging
which
is
drawn
in
part
from
the
language
earlier
in
paragraph
16
which
starts
out
by
saying,
“the
primary
purpose
of
the
retirement
plan
was
to
create
an
incentive
for
physicians
to
remain
with
the
medical
group,
and
then
in
omitting
some
words,
to
ensure
health
plan
that
it
would
have
a
stable
and
reliable
group
of
physicians
providing
medical
service.”
mr.
valentine
brookes
this
is
what
i
have
just
stated.
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
not
my
only
argument.
however,
i
am
seeking
to
get
the
facts
before
the
court.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
it
would.
mr.
valentine
brookes
no,
your
honor.
my
point
is,
it
would
not
be
that
the
parties
would
so
agree,
but
rather
i
would
turn
to
the
substance
of
their
agreement.
and
this
gets
too
far
as
the
most
critical
point
in
this
case
in
my
opinion
which
is
that
as
to
the
taxpayers,
the
amounts
paid
into
the
trust
were
wholly
contingent
and
forfeitable.
they
had
no
enforceable
right
to
them
until
the
lapse
of
conditions
which
had
not
occurred
at
this
time.
they
must
either
serve
15
years
or
serve
10
years
and
become
65
before
any
of
their
accounts
seems
to
be
tentative.
but
even
after
the
attainment
of
these
conditions,
they
must
continue
to
make
themselves
available
even
after
retirement.
for
consultation
purposes
and
refrain
from
competition.
if
they
fail
to
live
up
to
those
conditions
then
too,
they
forfeit
even
though
their
payments
had
began
up
to
the
time
of
the
second
type
of
conditions
of
forfeiture.
mr.
valentine
brookes
when
they
get
it,
your
honor.
mr.
valentine
brookes
oh,
i
think
not
except
in
the
most
general
way,
your
honor.
there
had
been
a
predecessor
partnership.
health
plan
had
been
in
existence
for
years
prior
to
the
execution
of
any
of
the
contracts
that
are
on
the
record
here.
indeed,
it
entered
into
the
employment
agreement
if
i
may
so
term
it
with
the
partnership,
six
months
before
the
establishment
of
the
funded
plan.
so
there
was
a
period
of
six
months
in
which
it
was
contemplated.
there
might
be
such
a
plan
but
it
was
not
in
being
and
yet
the
physicians
were
working
under
the
partnership
agreement
and
the
other
agreement
with
health
plan.
these
were
not,
however
simultaneously
born.
mr.
valentine
brookes
no,
i
am
not
your
honor.
the
health
plan
was
established
by
a
funding
of
a
large
sum
from
prominent
california
family
for
the
purpose
of
providing
prepaid
low
cost
medical
care
on
a
nonprofit
basis.
it
existed.
it
had
--hospitals
acquired
more,
they
found
that
it
couldn’t
operate
them
without
physicians.
it
also
found
that
it
could
not
balance
the
budget
if
outside
physicians
selected
by
the
patients
were
employed
at
normal
fee
rates,
so
it
became
necessary
to
establish
a
relationship
with
the
group
of
physicians
who
would
provide
it
exclusively
with
their
services.
it
is
the
outgrowth
of
the
years
of
experience
which
has
produced
the
documents
and
the
record
here.
there
was
a
prior
partnership
agreement.
the
one
before
you
was
entered
into
a
1959
and
the
record
does
not
state
how
long
back
in
the
history
the
prior
relationship
of
health
plan
with
other
partnerships
had
been
created.
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
valentine
brookes
and
so
it
is
mr.
justice.
and
the
essential
key
to
its
success
is
the
availability
of
the
group
of
physicians
under
the
exclusivity
conditions
which
exists
here.
the
court
below
used
the
language
exclusivity.
it
was
not
original
with
me.
i
am
borrowing
their
language
and
it
is
exclusive
in
both
directions.
that
is
to
save
health
plan
contracts
to
have
the
medical
services
performed
exclusively
by
the
physicians
who
are
either
partners
of
or
employees
of
the
partnership.
and
in
turn,
the
partnership
contracts
that
its
partners
and
its
employees
will
perform
services
--
no
services
for
any
other
health
plan
but
this
one.
there’s
a
limited
provision
for
their
having
private
practice
in
which
case
there
earnings
go
into
the
partnership
as
well
but
their
private
practice
is
not
permitted
to
interfere
with
their
employment
or
their
services
for
health
plan
because
they
must
provide
their
full
time
or
the
equivalent
thereof
for
health
plan.
the
court
of
appeals
in
further
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
to
whether
i
correctly
interpret
that
one
sentence
in
the
stipulation
isolated
from
the
balance
of
the
stipulation.
so
that
the
agreement
provides
that
kaiser’s
contributions
to
the
plan
are
to
be
in
addition
to
all
other
sums
payable
by
kaiser.
thus,
had
permanente
elected
not
to
establish
the
retirement
plan,
it
could
not
have
received
additional
current
income.
it
then
states,
there
--
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record,
this
is
at
page
40
of
the
opinion,
rather
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
permanente
agreed
to
accept
less
direct
compensation
from
kaiser
in
exchange
for
the
retirement
plan
payments.
that
kaiser
would
not
have
been
willing
to
make
the
payments
except
into
the
trusts
under
the
conditions
imposed
is
consistent
with
the
primary
purpose
of
the
retirement
plan
to
ensure
kaiser
a
stable
and
reliable
group
of
physicians.
we
therefore
conclude
that
permanente,
there
is
a
deletion
at
this
point
mr.
chief
justice.
we
therefore
conclude
that
permanente
never
having
had
the
right
to
receive
the
income
could
not
have
diverted
it
to
others.
this,
i
believe
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
hypothetical
of
the
law
firm
that
was
assumed
for
argument
purposes
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
valentine
brookes
mr.
justice
i
am
glad
you
gave
me
the
chance,
the
opportunity
of
making
that
clear.
i
do
not
concede
that
that
different,
that
the
case
depends
upon
that
difference.
my
case
is
--
mr.
valentine
brookes
the
court
might
still
find
it
and
i
think
also.
this
--
the
difference
make
create
a
climate
for
the
approach
to
the
case.
and
i
would
like
that
climate
which
i
considered
to
be
somewhat
adverse
to
be
removed.
the
law
probably
makes
no
difference,
no
distinction.
the
rules
are
quite
clear
in
the
case
of
the
status
of
employees
or
independent
contractors
that
the
result
that
we
argue
for
would
follow
because
their
interests
in
the
retirement
payments
are
entirely
profitable
and
contingent.
even
in
the
event
of
a
nonqualified
plan
where
there
are
employees,
congress
has
stated
its
policy
and
its
policy
is
with
a
funded
but
nonqualified
plan.
this
is
a
funded
plan
and
a
nonqualified
plan.
the
payments
by
the
employer
to
the
trust
or
into
the
fund
are
not
current
income
to
the
employee
if
their
rights
are
non-forfeitable
at
the
time
that
the
payments
were
made,
section
402
(b)
of
the
code
so
states.
we
can
not
claim
that
we
come
under
the
umbrella
of
that
section
because
we
are
independent
contractors.
we
are
not
the
employees.
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
physicians
are
employees
but
they
are
employees
of
the
partnership
and
paradoxically,
the
government
does
not
seek
to
tax
them.
on
the
contrary,
it
seeks
to
tax
the
amounts
paid
to
the
retirement
fund
for
their
possible
future
benefit
to
the
partners
and
would
allow
the
partners
no
deduction
for
the
amounts
that
are
actually
potentially
receivable
by
the
employees.
and
the
paradox
becomes
complete.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
so
works
out
this
plan
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
ultimately
the
only
beneficiaries
will
be
the
employees.
if
the
partners
all
peel
off
one
by
one
and
leave
no
one
but
those
persons
who
are
presently
employees
as
participants
in
the
plan,
all
forfeitures
go
to
the
benefit
of
those
remaining
in
the
plan
and
i
have
indicated
the
hypothesis
that
they
are
employees.
they
may
later
become
partners
but
at
this
time
they
are
employees
and
may
be
the
sole
beneficiaries.
mr.
valentine
brookes
no,
your
honor.
we
seek
to
rely
up
on
the
statute.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
government’s
position
based
upon
lucas
against
earl
is
some
because
it
is
not
derived
from
the
statute.
lucas
against
earl
is
certainly
a
distinguished
and
important
case
but
to
illustrate,
your
honor,
how
statutes
may
change
what
has
been
the
law
in
the
past.
if
mr.
earl
is
still
alive,
he
can
derive
the
benefits
from
the
statute
which
he
could
not
derive
under
the
method
he
attempted
in
lucas
against
earl
because
all
he
needs
to
do
now
is
file
a
joint
return
with
his
wife
and
he
would
get
the
split
income
benefits
that
he
sought
by
the
devise
that
was
denied
to
him.
so
statutes
do
change
things
and
we
rely
upon
the
statutes,
and
we
have
discussed
this
as
a
considerable
length
in
our
brief
and
i
would
like
--
it’s
difficult
to
discuss
a
statute
in
all
oral
argument
without
the
statute
before
you.
but
i
--
this
is
not
such
a
conflict
statute
as
that.
first,
the
section
701
which
appears
in
the
appendix
to
respondent’s
brief
which
is
to
white
one,
it
appears
at
page
3
of
the
appendix.
the
appendix
is
separated
from
the
rest
by
a
blue
insert
sheet.
it
says
that
a
partnership
as
such
shall
not
be
subject
to
the
income
tax.
persons
carrying
on
business
as
partners
shall
be
liable
for
income
tax
only
in
their
separate
or
individual
capacities.
the
point
that
we
see
in
that
section
is
that
congress
is
thinking
of
a
partnership
not
as
an
entity
conducting
business
but
rather
as
an
aggregate
of
individuals,
of
persons
carrying
on
business
as
partners.
it
is
consistent
with
that
trust
that
emphasis
that
section
703
which
appears
on
page
5
of
our
appendix
says
that
the
taxable
income
of
a
partnership
shall
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
case
of
an
individual
except
that
and
none
of
the
exceptions
is
applicable
here
and
the
government
has
never
contended
that
any
of
them
was
applicable
here.
so
it
says
that
the
taxable
income
of
a
partnership
shall
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
case
of
an
individual.
there
history
behind
these
projections.
they
are
derived
--
the
ones
which
--
the
language
which
i
have
read
is
derived
without
significant
change
from
the
prior
code.
this
court
construed
the
prior
code
in
neuberger
to
adopt
the
context
then
before
it,
the
aggregate
theory
rather
than
the
entity
theory.
there
are
lots
of
words
used
for
these
theories
and
there
the
court
used
both
the
entity
language
and
the
unit
language.
and
it
also
referred
to
the
partnership
as
an
association
of
individuals.
and
it
allowed
a
partner
to
offset
his
individual
non-capital
losses
against
his
share
of
the
partnership’s
non-capital
losses
even
though
the
statutes
could
more
readily
who
have
been
construed
in
the
other
way
under
the
doctrine
of
ejusdem
generis
which
the
court
refused
to
apply
because
it
thought
and
i
“that
congress
has
recognize
the
partnership
both
as
a
business
unit
and
as
an
association
of
individuals.”
but
they
said
this
weakens
rather
than
strengthens
the
government’s
argument
that
the
privileges
are
distinct
and
that
the
unit
characteristics
of
the
partnership
must
be
emphasized.
and
interestingly,
at
that
point
they
cited
among
the
cases
a
case
from
the
court
of
claims
that
craik
case.
and
the
craik
case
involved
a
nonresident
who
was
a
member
of
the
resident
partnership.
the
question
was
whether
he
was
taxable
upon
the
entire
distributive
share
of
his
income
of
the
partnership
or
merely
a
portion
of
it.
some
of
the
partnership
income
was
also
from
foreign
sources
as
he
resided
abroad.
and
the
court
of
claims
used
the
language
undoubtedly
referred
to
by
this
court
in
referring
to
the
craik
case
that
at
common
law,
each
partner
was
the
agent
for
the
other
partners
in
carrying
up
their
common
purpose.
the
income
earned
by
the
partnership
was
regarded
as
having
been
earned
by
the
individual
partners
either
by
himself
individually
or
through
his
agents,
the
other
partners.
the
court
below
used
the
term
that
the
partnership
was
acting
only
as
the
agent
of
its
members
and
it
used
that
in
this
context,
in
this
sense,
in
the
petition
and
in
the
brief,
both
the
government
has
sought
to
make
capital
of
the
use
of
the
term
agent.
but
this
is
the
classical
concept
of
the
relationship
of
one
partner
to
the
other.
and
in
the
craik
case
which
this
court
spoke
of
approvingly
in
neuberger.
the
court
did
say
that
each
partner
was
regarded
as
having
earned
the
income.
the
statute
says
that
in
section
701
that
the
businesses
done
by
individuals
or
by
persons
doing
business
in
the
form
of
a
partnership
and
it
shows
that
the
income
of
the
partnership
shall
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
case
of
an
individual.
if
those
instructions
are
applied
then
we
see
that
the
fact
that
the
payments
into
the
trust
by
health
plan
create
only
forfeitable
and
contingent
rights
and
the
taxpayers
is
controlling.
under
volumes
of
doctrine
including
many
decisions
from
this
court
whether
on
the
cash
or
the
accrual
basis,
a
taxpayer
does
not
have
income
so
long
as
his
claims
to
whatever
the
property
is
remained
contingent
and
forfeitable.
that
rule
has
been
applied
consistently
in
deferred
compensation
cases.
lucas
against
earl
has
never
been
applied
in
deferred
compensation
cases.
it
has
been
cited
by
the
government
time
after
time
in
deferred
compensation
cases
as
it
was
in
both
courts
here
and
it
has
been
rejected
in
all
of
those
cases
including
the
two
courts
below
here.
and
the
reason
is,
mrs.
earl
received
money
in
1921
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
mr.
earl
was
held
taxable
upon
it.
he
was
not
held
taxable
upon
any
income
in
an
earlier
year
before
somebody
received
it.
and
so
it
should
be
here,
these
individuals
should
be
taxable
when
they
receive
their
income
and
not
before.
mr.
valentine
brookes
this
is
true,
your
honor.
the
code
has
a
further
answer
to
the
government’s
position
and
that
is,
it
says,
that
this
is
section
704
it
appears
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
that
the
relevant
part
is
on
page
5.
it’s
the
first
words
of
section
704.
a
partners’
distributive
share
of
income
gain,
loss,
deduction
or
credit
shall
and
so
on
be
determined
by
the
partnership
agreement
then
it
goes
on.
and
i
was
mistaken,
this
is
the
critical
language.
the
partner’s
distributive
share
of
any
item
of
income
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
this
distributive
share
unless
the
agreement
of
the
parties
provides
to
the
contrary.
the
point
is
that
a
partner
is
not
taxable
on
--
inflexibly
on
“x”
percentage
of
the
net
income
of
the
partnership.
it
used
to
be
under
the
old
code.
there’s
a
difference
now.
his
distributive
share
is
of
an
item
of
gross
income
as
well
as
of
net
income.
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
permit
persons
who
attribute
or
contribute
appreciated
property
to
a
partnership.
and
by
a
partnership,
interest
based
on
the
appreciated
value
to
be
the
sole
taxpayers
on
that
appreciated
value
if
the
property
is
sold
for
a
profit.
so
that
the
property
or
the
gain
which
the
partners
have
bought
by
admitting,
the
new
partner
will
not
be
taxable
to
all
of
them
proportionately.
mr.
valentine
brookes
well,
if
it
was
sold.
mr.
valentine
brookes
the
point
of
appreciation
in
value
above
basis
would
be
related
to
the
depreciation
to
be
taken
by
the
partnership
[voice
overlap]
not
to
remember
years.
mr.
valentine
brookes
in
subsequent
years.
now
the
statute
and
the
regulations
recognizes
permit
the
parties
to
vary
the
depreciation
amongst
themselves
so
that
the
depreciation
may
go
to
the
party
who
contributes
the
appreciated
asset
rather
than
being
enjoyed
by
the
partners
who
have
not
contributed
the
appreciated
asset
and
conversely,
in
the
example
i
gave
a
moment
ago,
if
that
property,
that
building
should
be
sold
the
statute
permits
that
partner
to
be
the
one
exclusively
taxable
upon
that
appreciation
which
has
now
become
gain.
so
the
distributive
share
may
be
only
of
one
item
of
gross
income
and
my
point
is
that
a
distributive
share
is
a
proportionate
share.
a
case
the
government
relies
on
heiner
against
mellon
in
so
long.
mr.
valentine
brookes
i
answered
what
i
thought
was
his
question.
mr.
valentine
brookes
oh!
[voice
overlap]
mr.
valentine
brookes
if
i
hear
--
i
did
not
so
understand
the
question.
yes,
your
honor,
so
it
would
be.
but
there
is
nothing
forfeitable
or
contingent.
mr.
valentine
brookes
oh,
yes,
of
course
it
is.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes.
mr.
valentine
brookes
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
valentine
brookes
no,
they’re
just
treated
like
an
individual
or
corporate
taxpayer.
there
taxable
income
is
determined
as
if
they
were
individuals
and
if
an
individual
has
income
and
he
buys
a
depreciable
asset,
his
income
is
not
reduced
thereby.
he
gets
depreciation
in
the
future,
so
it
would
be
here.
but
the
point
that
i
am
seeking
to
make
goes
off
from
that,
your
honor
and
it
is
to
allot
the
word
distributive.
the
statute
now
permits
distributive
shares
to
relate
to
items
of
gross
income,
not
merely
to
the
sum
of
net
income.
and
the
word
distributive
was
construed
by
this
court
as
meaning
proportionate.
and
here,
no
partner
knows
what
his
proportion
of
the
chair
of
this
item
of
income
is,
if
it
is
income.
now,
of
course,
we
deny
that
it
is
income.
but
if
it
were
deemed
to
be
income
of
the
partnership,
his
proportionate
share
is
unknown.
it’s
dependent
upon
future
events.
mr.
valentine
brookes
it’s
purchased
from
taxable
income
which
has
come
in
and
should
be
taxed.
this
--
but
there
was
no
deferment
of
receipt
there
mr.
justice
white.
here
there
is
non-receipt,
and
not
only
a
deferment
of
receipt
but
the
contingency
of
possible
non-receipt.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
valentine
brookes
your
honor,
only
if
the
documents
could
be
so
construed
that
medical
plan
have
no
alternative
but
to
do
this.
but
the
fact,
that
that
is
not
the
case
is
very
important
here.
mr.
valentine
brookes
medical
plan
has
never
received
this
income
in
the
case
which
you
have
spoken
of.
medical
plan
had
to
receive
it
but
it
is
obligated
to
do
something
with
it.
the
doctrine
of
receipt
and
non-receipt
is
obviously
important
in
the
income
tax
law.
the
plan
here
came
into
bidding
under
the
thrust
of
the
initiative
of,
let
me
call
it
the
employer,
and
medical
plan
has
no
control
over
it.
now,
i
grant,
your
honor
that
you
have
given
me
a
hypothetical
in
which
they
can
only
do
one
thing
with
it.
they
can
only
pay
it
over
to
a
trust
and
i
assume
the
other
provisions
are
the
same
as
they
are
here
but
they
cannot
get
it
back
except
under
conditions
of
that
possible
forfeiture.
yet,
the
fact
that
they
have
received
it
could
be
regarded
as
all
important.
here
they
have
not
received
anything.
mr.
valentine
brookes
well,
yes,
your
honor.
they
have
agreed
not
to.
mr.
valentine
brookes
the
stipulation
of
facts
may
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
page
84
of
the
record,
it
says,
“no
payments
were
made
to
the
trust
during
the
years
in
question
by
medical
group
or
by
an
individual
or
by
individual
participants
in
the
retirement
plan.”
that
is
the
last
sentence
of
a
paragraph
on
page
84
of
the
record,
your
honor.
thank
you.
