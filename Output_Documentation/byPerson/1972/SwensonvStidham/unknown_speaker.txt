unknown
speaker
where
would
you
stop
it?
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
denying
the
function
of
federal
habeas?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
mr.
hennelly,
it
goes
back
under
the
eighth
circuit’s
disposition
it
goes
back
to
another
state
court
here?
unknown
speaker
and
meanwhile
the
conviction
does
not
stand
vacated
pending
that
hearing?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not,
it
has
not
been
vacated?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
hennelly,
can
i
ask,
isn’t
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
that
if
in
fact
jackson-denno
was
not
followed,
then
the
jackson
and
denno
remedy
is
to
go
back
to
a
state
judge
and
have
a
state
judge
not
vacating
the
conviction,
have
a
state
judge
have
a
new
hearing
on
the
question
only
in
voluntary.
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
finds
it,
it
was
voluntary
then
the
conviction
remains
under
--
unknown
speaker
if
he
finds
it
was
involuntary
then
he
sets
the
convicted
free.
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
gather
on
the
jackson-denno
it
could
not
go
back
to
judge
collinson
in
the
federal
district
but
it
had
to
go
back
to
a
state
judge.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
more
question
mr.
hennelly,
i
gather
then
that
how
did
this
case
gets
back
to
--
judge
godfrey
is
a
state
court
judge?
unknown
speaker
how
did
it
go
back
to
him?
unknown
speaker
and
your
submission
is
that
judge
godfrey
did
not
in
fact
make
a
finding
out
of
the
voluntariness?
unknown
speaker
had
he
made
one
then
jackson
and
denno
you
agree
would
have
been
satisfied?
unknown
speaker
but
all
he
did
was
go
back
to
--
who
was
the
original
judge?
unknown
speaker
and
what
--
you
have
pointed
out
to
us
at
685
and
686,
is
judge
godfrey’s
characterization
of
what
happened
before
judge
webber,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
it
is?
unknown
speaker
your
submission
is
that
is
the
characterization
of
what
happened
before
judge
webber.
unknown
speaker
instead
of
doing
as
he
should
have
done
both
as
the
supreme
court
required
him
to
do
and
to
satisfy
jackson
and
denno
make
his
own
independent
determination
of
voluntariness.
unknown
speaker
the
difficulty
is
that
the
supreme
court
to
the
holding
here
and
determine
voluntariness.
the
judge
had
the
hearing
and
he
said
some
whatever
he
says
and
you
appealed
again,
the
supreme
court
in
missouri
found
no
error
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
his
activity.
apparently,
the
court
thought
that
it
complied
completely
with
their
prior
order.
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
it
did
or
not,
whatever
he
found
did
not
entitle
anyone
to
any
relief
with
respect
to
the
confession.
unknown
speaker
and
you
still
have
to
deal
with
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
after
this
hearing.
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
wouldn’t
you
that
once
you
had
a
--
you
will
agree
that
there’s
no
need
for
a
further
hearing.
i
mean
evidentiary
hearing
there
is
full
opportunity
to
put
everything
in
the
record
that
anybody
wanted
too.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn’t
say
for
example.
you
wouldn’t
think
for
example
–-
let’s
assume
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
have
come
out
in
plain
words
and
said
“we’ve
examined
this
record.
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.”
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
i
mean
that
would
not
be
a
sufficient
--
unknown
speaker
well
in
any
event
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
this,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
when
you
appealed
after
the
second,
after
the
hearing
before
judge
godfrey.
unknown
speaker
supreme
court
of
missouri
said
“and
finally
the
court
found,”
referring
to
judge
godfrey,
the
court
found
it
said
“judge
godfrey
found
has
had
the
previous
court
that
the
oral
and
written
confessions
were
voluntary.”
unknown
speaker
and
needless
to
add
the
latter
finding
is
overwhelmingly
supported
in
procedure
and
factually.
the
cause
meets
all
the
requirements
for
federal
cases.
now
at
least
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
disagrees
with
you
as
to
what
judge
godfrey
found
and
in
any
event
it
reads
it
that
way
and
finds
it
supportive
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
is
not
a
sufficient
satisfaction
for
jackson
and
denno.
unknown
speaker
have
you
been
in
this
case
for
18
years?
unknown
speaker
at
the
universal
trial?
unknown
speaker
you
are
from
missouri?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
argue
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
would
justify
the
purpose?
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
this
mr.
hennelly?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
other
prisoner’s
business
is
just
in
the
background?
unknown
speaker
the
actual
brutality
and
coercion
and
torture
was
the
being
lifted
off
by
his
handcuff
behind
him,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
where
would
you
stop
it?
unknown

you’re
not
denying
the

of

habeas?
