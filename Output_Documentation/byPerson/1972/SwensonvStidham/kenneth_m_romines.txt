mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
which
originated
in
the
western
district
of
missouri.
it
involves
a
question
concerning
jackson
versus
denno
and
sims
versus
georgia.
in
1955,
mr.
stidham
was
convicted
for
the
first-degree
murder
of
another
inmate
in
a
prison
riot
at
the
missouri
state
penitentiary.
the
original
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
1957.
mr.
stidham
filed
for
collateral
review
pursuant
to
missouri
supreme
court
rule
27.26
that
was
likewise
affirmed.
second
collateral
review
in
1967
was
sought
denied
by
the
circuit
court
of
moniteau
county,
missouri.
the
missouri
supreme
court
reversed
and
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
reinstated
mr.
stidham’s
direct
appeal
in
the
spirit
of
swenson
versus
bosler
which
required
counsel
on
appeal.
reaffirmed
in
1970,
mr.
stidham
sought
habeas
to
the
western
district
of
missouri
through
judge
collinson.
judge
collinson
dismissed
five
separate
grounds
it
was
appealed.
the
appeal
was
dismissed
by
mr.
stidham,
he
tried
to
reinstate
the
appeal
on
the
court
did
not
allow
the
reinstatement.
he
filed
a
second
habeas
corpus
petition
before
judge
collinson.
judge
collinson
on
relying
upon
the
former
opinion
denied
it
and
also
denied
a
new
issue
involving
coleman
versus
alabama.
of
the
five
issues
that
then
went
to
the
eighth
circuit,
four
were
affirmed,
one
the
jackson
v.
denno
issue
was
found
by
two-to-one
vote
to
be
that
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
their
review
of
missouri
case
law
demonstrated
that
the
missouri
trial
court
had
and
frequently
used
the
right
to
submit
the
question
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury
without
a
prior
determination
independently
by
the
judge
of
voluntariness.
in
essence,
i
feel
that
the
eighth
circuit
clearly
has
held
the
missouri
rule
as
the
same
as
in
new
york
rule.
under
jackson
which
was
struck
down
the
judge
could
not
exclude
a
confession,
if
there
were
circumstance
which
indicated
testimony
on
both
sides.
he
was
not
entitled
to
exclude
a
confession
merely
because
he
himself
would
have
found
it
involuntary.
in
essence,
he
was
without
judicial
power
to
resolve
the
conflicting
evidence
on
voluntariness.
this
court
held
that
the
defendant
had
the
right
at
some
point
to
a
hearing
and
a
determination
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
and
the
court
expressed
the
opinion
not
to
give
the
jury
the
dual
function
of
deciding
voluntariness
and
the
factual
history
did
not
give
the
defendant
constitutional
determination
that
he
was
due.
now
because
of
the
way
that
the
eighth
circuit
read
the
missouri
procedure,
we’ve
dealt
extensively
with
all
cases
beginning
from
1829
when
it
became
a
state.
hector
a
slave
versus
the
state
all
the
way
through
up
to
the
most
recent
cases.
basically,
i
think
distilling
those
cases
indicates
that
the
missouri
procedure
contemplated
a
preliminary
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
that
at
that
hearing
the
state
had
the
burden
of
non-persuasion.
after
that
hearing,
the
court
could
waive
the
evidence
and
find
the
confession
involuntary
and
refused
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury;
or
the
court
could
find
the
confession,
competent
evidence,
instruct
the
jury
on
their
duty
to
find
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
and
instruct
on
their
duty
to
find
that
if
they
find
that
if
they
found
it
was
voluntary
they
then
had
the
second
determination
to
make
whether
they
thought
it
was
true
and
they
believe
it.
now
the
eighth
circuit
quotes
rather
deafly
i
believe
with
the
use
of
ellipsis
from
different
cases
in
missouri
as
their
basic
reasons
for
saying
the
missouri
procedure
was
bad.
one
of
those
cases,
state
versus
bradford
at
the
part
in
the
opinion
just
before
the
court
gets
into
what
is
admittedly
equivocal
language
and
it’s
pretty
difficult
to
determine
exactly
what
the
procedure
is,
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
this,
“the
court
is
not
obliged
to
submit
the
issue
of
voluntariness
of
a
confession
to
a
jury
merely
because
there
were
substantial
evidence
tending
to
show
the
confession
was
voluntary,
however
much
the
evidence
of
its
voluntary
character
is
outweigh
by
the
evidence
to
the
contrary.”
now
after
that
portion
follows
some
equivocal
language
which
the
court
sets
out
which
indicates
that
but
the
better
rule
is
that,
if
there
is
a
real
close
question,
just
let
it
go
to
the
jury.
now,
the
question
is
what’s
that
mean
and
my
answer
is
it’s
pretty
hard
to
tell.
i
don’t
believe
it
means
exactly
what
the
eighth
circuit
say.
i
don’t
believe
that
is
the
exact
way
the
new
york
procedure
worked
and
the
other
thing,
the
other
case
that
leads
me
to
that
conclusion
is
state
versus
gibraltar
which
they
also
quote,
the
court
there
says
“that
it
is
not
the
law
that
if
there
be
any
substantial
evidence
indicating
the
confession
was
voluntary
the
court
must
and
the
emphasis
in
our
brief
is
the
court’s
emphasis
must
refer
the
question
to
the
jury
however
much
may
be
outweighed
by
evidence
to
the
contrary.”
if
that
were
true,
the
court
would
be
doing
no
more
that
always
does
throughout
the
trial
in
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
and
there
would
be
no
need
of
such
preliminary
hearings
except
in
the
rare
instances
when
such
evidence
is
wholly
likely.
now,
here
is
where
the
equivocation
starts
as
it
happened
in
the
last
case.
on
the
other
hand,
when
there
is
substantial
conflicting
evidence
and
the
question
is
closed.
it
is
better
to
refer
the
underlying
issue
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury
than
to
exclude
the
confession
and
they
go
on
with
some
language
about
miscarriage
of
justice
if
this
is
not
done.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no
sir,
to
the
extent
that
might
be
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
my
questions,
presumably
that’s
it.
i
go
one
step
further
and
said,
“no
matter
what
the
law
in
missouri
might
have
been
in
1955
we
have
to
determine
what
this
judge
did
on
the
facts
before
him.”
that
is
why
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
made
a
mistake,
because
if
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct
at
the
judge
on
the
record
find
said
“i
make
the
finding
that
this
confession
was
voluntary
as
a
matter
of
law
if
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct”
no
matter
that
wouldn’t
have
been
a
proper
finding.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
yes
sir,
that’s
what
i
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
right.
that
i
believe
is
a
basic
issue
not
necessarily
so
much
what
the
missouri
procedure
may
or
may
not
have
been.
i
meant
that
might
be
a
nice
intellectual
inquire
but
frankly
i
am
concerned
that
in
this
particular
case
that
we
hold
or
that
the
court
holds,
that
the
procedure
that
this
judge
used,
the
words
this
judge
used
after
the
inquiry
that
was
made
was
sufficient
under
jackson
versus
denno.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
in
a
particular
case
where
the
law
is
perhaps
unclear
as
the
court
indicates
at
least
two
members
of
the
court
indicated
they
felt
this
was,
perhaps
that
is
a
proper
inquiry
but
i
think
on
the
particular
reason
that
we’re
here
today
that
that’s
not
the
proper
inquiry.
basically,
i
guess
the
most
charitable
thing,
perhaps
the
worst
thing
that
could
be
said
for
all
these
cases
is
that
a
basic
general
rule
could
not
be
established
and
the
early
cases
up
to
about
1930
clearly
indicate
the
judge
made
the
decision.
there
are
some
equivocation
and
some
of
the
cases
after
that
and
i
think
the
--
especially
if
you
read
state
versus
laster,
you’ll
find
a
case
where
the
attorney
comes
in
and
he
will
not
put
on
any
evidence
and
so
there
up
crops
what’s
called
the
prima
facie
rule
which
that
puts
language
in
the
cases
that
the
next
time
a
judge
uses,
i
don’t
think
the
correct
factual
circumstances.
in
this
case,
mr.
hennelly
who
was
a
vigorous
trial
lawyer,
as
i
believe,
the
transcripts
will
indicate
requested
of
the
judge
a
second
judge
coming
in
from
another
circuit.
the
case
was
being
heard
on
a
change
of
venue,
i
would
say
approximately
250
to
300
miles
away
from
the
state
penitentiary
county
that
it
is
in.
he
requested
testimony
on
the
confession,
the
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury
that
was
given.
now
the
language
we
specifically
set
out
in
the
brief.
the
first
time
that
one
of
the
officers
gets
up
to
testify
about
the
confession,
mr.
hennelly
indicates
at
this
point
your
honor
if
it
please,
the
defendant
moves
the
court
to
conduct
a
preliminary
hearing
and
asks
the
court
to
inquire
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
statement
and
to
determine
whether
the
statement
was
given
voluntarily
either
the
oral
or
the
written
statement
and
we
ask
that
the
hearing
be
held
outside
the
jury.
that
was
done.
evidence
was
taken
and
covers
pages
80-85
pages
of
the
transcript.
all
the
officers
testify,
the
defendants
testifies
and
at
the
end
of
that
mr.
hennelly
indicates
that
is
all,
that
is
the
defendants
motion.
then
the
court’s
language
which
has,
perhaps
what’s
caused
the
confusion
is
now
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury
the
request
by
the
defendant
for
a
hearing
upon
a
statement
which
has
been
identified
as
1616.
it
is
the
court’s
opinion
that
the
matters
concerning
the
statements
should
be
offered
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
subject
of
course
to
any
attacks
as
to
its
credibility
by
the
defendant.
the
defendant
has
of
course
the
right
to
proceed
to
challenge
the
voluntariness
of
the
statements
and
confession
even
before
the
jury.
but
it
is
the
court’s
opinion
and
upon
the
evidence
that
has
been
offered
before
the
court
and
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury
that
the
statement
is
and
should
be
admissible,
then
he
follows
with
some
other
non-appropriate
language.
mr.
hennelly
merely
jumps
off
and
says
“in
other
words,
the
court
is
over
ruling
my
motion.”
and
request
that
the
court
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
statements
were
involuntary
is
that
right?
the
court,
“that
is
right.”
he
brings
him
back
in,
now
of
course
if
you
accept
what
the
eighth
circuit
says
the
law
was,
that’s
--
that
can
be
read
two
ways.
the
one
way,
the
way
that
we
say
it
should
be
read.
the
other
way,
the
way
mr.
hennelly
says
it
should
be
read
to
the
extent
that
okay,
he
is
equivocating.
if
he
was
trying
to
make
the
decision
as
well
as
there
is
enough
evidence
here
that
may
be
ought
not
to
rule
it
goes.
i
think
it’s
clear
from
the
judge’s
actions
here
that
he
is
saying
“i
don’t
believe
a
word
stidham
is
saying.”
he
has
decided
credibility,
that’s
what
we
are
talking
about
in
jackson,
has
this
man
ever
had
the
credibility
of
his
voluntariness
decided
before
the
jury
gets
it
in
that
mixed
nature
of
trying
to
decide
whether
it
is
truthful
and
whether
it
happened.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
true.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
there
was
some
changing
of
testimony
but
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
true,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
true.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
it
wouldn’t.
the
only
trouble
your
honor
is
with
what
the
judge
said,
we
are
again
hang-up
in
semantics.
the
judge
did
not
say
“i
view
the
evidence,
i
find
it
voluntary.”
he
said
“i
view
the
evidence”
the
judge
in
1955
found
it
voluntary
as
he
should
have,
so
it
is
not
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right,
he
did.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
think
it
certainly
is
and
we
argue
that,
we
also
have
argued
that
the
determination
that
the
supreme
court
made
on
appeal
was
sufficient
on
the
judges,
on
the
reinstated
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
judge
collinson
said
it
was
voluntary.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
those
words,
all
of
the
words
in
there
or
mr.
hennelly’s
words,
the
judge
only
rules,
he
did
not
say
voluntary
nor
not
involuntary.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
he
doesn’t
say
anything.
he
says,
“i
am
going
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury.”
mr.
hennelly
then
says
“are
you
overruling
my
motion
that
it
is
not
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law?”
he
says
“correct,
call
in
the
next
witness.”
so
he
actually
uses
none
of
the
phrases
or
the
magic
rubric
as
judge
gibson
says,
he
does
not
indicate
that.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
he
could
have.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
correct.
he
had
that
power.
that’s
how
we
distinguish
it
from
the
new
york
rule
which
as
i
read
some
of
those
cases
it
seems
to
indicate
that
once
those
conflicting
evidence,
he
didn’t
have
the
power
to
take
it
away
from
the
jury.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that's
probably
--
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
true.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
the
eighth
circuit
recognize
under
sigler
versus
parker
that
it
had
to
be
a
determination
that
while
they
send
it
back
to
the
western
district
court,
it
was
only
the
whole
lot
case
until
new
proceedings
should
be
instituted
in
missouri,
which
evidently
indicates
a
third
collateral
attack
proceeding
in
missouri
for
mr.
stidham.
basically,
we
make
the
argument
that
the
supreme
court
on
appeal
and
particularly
the
judge
in
st.
louis
on
the
collateral
attack
hearing
on
the
27
and
26
have
made
a
sufficient
determination
under
jackson
and
on
our
brief
we
also
indicate
and
we
do
not
wish
to
waive
those
arguments
regarding
the
retroactivity
of
the
cases
although
it
is
pretty
difficult
to
plan
the
phase
of
jackson
which
we
apply
retroactively
to
a
habeas
case.
we
believe
that
it
should
not
apply
collaterally
standards
are
not
viable
at
the
time
of
the
original
appellate
review
of
the
court.
perhaps
and
i
have
heard
that
argument
made
into
two
or
three
other
cases
in
the
last
couple
of
days,
it
is
a
dog
that
won’t
hunt
but
we
believe
that
it
should
hunt.
it’s
a
problem
i
have
handled
in
the
office
three
years
and
i
have
handled
14,075
petitions
responses
to
show
off.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
in
three
years.
i
went
through
and
i
didn’t
believe
it.
the
more
the
docket
cards
i
went
through
the
more
the
numbers
came
up.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that
takes
in
the
western
and
the
eastern
district.
481
of
those
have
been
appealed,
84
have
been
reversed
and
only
one
in
this
case
have
i
had
a
gut
reaction
and
it’s
fairly
difficult
to
tell
exactly
what
it
is
but
it
is
a
lot
of
little
things
and
i
just
think
there
is
something
wrong
and
this
can
go
on
after
this
man
has
had
this
number
of
hearings
and
i
think
it
should
it
stop.
we
also
make
an
argument
in
the
brief.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
would
stop
it
right
here.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
i
am
not
concerned
with
that
and
i
will
try
to
deal
with
the
next
point.
the
other
part
of
our
argument
was
that
this
man
had
an
original
habeas.
it
went
to
the
eighth
circuit,
he
dismissed
his
appeal
or
basically
the
same
issues
except
for
the
coleman
v.
alabama
issue
which
he
brought
up
later
but
he
tried
to
reinstate
his
appeal.
the
eighth
circuit
said
no.
that
should
have
been
the
end
of
it
for
mr.
stidham
on
this
issue.
now
he
filed
a
second
habeas
corpus
in
the
western
district.
mr.
collinson
denied
him
relief
basing
it
on
his
prior
decision
and
also
denied
him
relief
on
coleman
versus
alabama.
it
goes
up
then
the
eighth
circuit
and
there
have
been
other
cases
involving
the
same
missouri
procedure
which
they’ve
not
felt
concerned
enough
to
tell
us
about
in
the
last
few
years
since
jackson
v.
denno.
in
this
case,
two
members
on
that
panel
decided
that
the
missouri
law
was
incorrectly
being
applied.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
we
did
not
have
oral
argument
your
honor.
we
opened
a
summary
docket.
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
yes,
sir
and
he
was
the
judge
that
dissented.
his
basis
being
that
missouri
supreme
court
is
the
one
to
judge
what
the
law
of
missouri
was
and
he
was
the
only
missouri
judge
on
that
three-man
panel.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
think
i
told
the
court
that
he
was
impressive
trial
lawyer,
he
is.
two
things
i
might
mention,
one
on
exactly
what
the
eighth
circuit
did
with
the
case.
they
sent
it
back
for
a
hearing
in
the
state
court
under
sigler
versus
parker.
i
am
not
sure
that
was
correct
because
they
did
not
indicate
what
new
facts
there
are
to
be
determined.
it
looks
to
me
like
there
is
sufficient
record
on
both
the
original
trial
and
the
27-26
to
determine
what
all
the
facts
were.
i
am
not
convinced
as
is
mr.
hennelly,
some
judge
perhaps
even
this
court
under
boulden
versus
holman
could
not
just
sit
and
look
at
the
facts.
i
think
clearly
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
could
take
that
cold
record
and
on
the
authority
under
boulden
versus
holman
and
jackson
itself
say
this
confession
is
voluntary.
now
as
to
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
concerning
the
testimony,
i
believe
that
pages
770
and
771
of
the
appendix.
the
court
indicates
that
they
are
merely
indulging
themselves
in
procunier
versus
ashley
which
says
that
“if
we
were
to
believe
mr.
stidham’s
facts,
clearly
he
would
be
due
some
relief.”
they’ve
not
said
they
believe
him,
all
they
said
is
that
for
the
purposes
of
testing
whether
the
five
or
six
allegations
he
make
on
their
face
would
grant
him
relief.
if
they
were
true,
we
will
not
apply
procunier,
we
will
send
this
back,
we
will
not
say
it
was
involuntary
and
we
will
also
not
say
that
it
was
voluntary.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
they
requested
a
letter
from
me
sometime
in
early
april
specifically
referring
to
the
fact
that
they
have
not
had
anything
to
eat
or
drink
and
requested
transcript
references.
i
sent
what
i
thought
were
appropriate
transcript
references
back
to
him
and
also
some
fairly
inflammatory
argument
as
to
exactly
what
they
wanted.
they
were
concerned
about
his
testimonies
to
loss
of
weight.
he
testified
that
and
this
is
at
the
27
and
26
now,
he
testifies
that
he
lost
25
pounds
during
a
six-day
period.
then
he
testified
that
he
was
not
given
anything
to
eat.
other
than
that,
they
did
not
indicate
in
their
letter
for
the
most
two
things
exactly
what
these
other
loose
ends
are
and
of
course
as
we
have
indicated
on
a
footnote
you
are
going
to
have
loose
ends
in
every
case
that’s
tried
and
certainly
it
is
not
the
law
that
you
have
to
present
rebuttal
testimony
to
every
allegation
a
man
makes
before
you
can
determine
credibility,
and
that’s
all
that
i
think
is
basically
involved
there.
judge
collinson
was
able
to
determine
credibility
with
the
same
loose
ends
as
were
all
the
other
courts.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
you
mean
what
do
i
know
or
what
does
the
record
believe?
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
the
judge
at
the
case
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
okay,
one
of
the
officers
at
the
27
to
26
testified,
all
of
the
police
officers
are
high
and
prominent
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
oh,
yes,
he
said
that
the
cell
did
not
contain
water
but
when
we
went
there
was
a
bunk
that
the
man
did
not
look
like
he
was
hungry.
he
did
not
show
any
signs
of
beating
as
the
doctor
indicated
he
had
subjective
complaints
but
nothing
objective
other
than
a
rugged
scar
between
this
finger
and
this
finger
of
his
ring
hand.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates
that
he
had
been
there
20
months.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right,
before
escape.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
there
is
nothing
that
indicates
there
are
no
cockroaches.
i
mean
no
one
was
asked
of
silly
question,
did
you
see
a
cockroach
instead
of
volunteers.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
oh,
if
i
were
to
bring
it,
i
think
the
first
question
i
would
asks
somebody
if
i
could
find
somebody
would
be
that
question
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
we
have
here
today
that
indicates
that
there
were
no
cockroaches,
that
is
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that
is
the
law,
your
honor.
now
the
20-month
period
that
he
was
in
maximum
security.
he
was
in
maximum
security
for
an
attempted
escape.
now
the
record
indicates
20
months.
i
have
not
done
any
independent
research
that
indicates
anything
different.
clearly
he
has
been
down
there
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
where
this
differs
from
some
of
the
cases
involving
missouri,
he
was
not
in
maximum
security
looking
toward
an
eventual
confession
as
was
the
other
case.
he
was
there
for
a
legitimate
concern,
escape.
in
the
first
few
words
in
the
judge
barrett
opinion
indicate
this
man’s
name
is
slick
stidham
and
he
is
not
called
slick
stidham
because
he
is
straight.
they
had
even
maximum
security
for
an
escape,
he
was
not
there
looking
toward
anything
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that
is
right,
behind
his
back.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right
and
being
beaten
with
corporal
bat.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
which
originated
in
the
western
district
of
missouri.
it
involves
a
question
concerning
jackson
versus
denno
and
sims
versus
georgia.
in
1955,
mr.
stidham
was
convicted
for
the
first-degree
murder
of
another
inmate
in
a
prison
riot
at
the
missouri
state
penitentiary.
the
original
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
1957.
mr.
stidham
filed
for
collateral
review
pursuant
to
missouri
supreme
court
rule
27.26
that
was
likewise
affirmed.
second
collateral
review
in
1967
was
sought
denied
by
the
circuit
court
of
moniteau
county,
missouri.
the
missouri
supreme
court
reversed
and
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
reinstated
mr.
stidham’s
direct
appeal
in
the
spirit
of
swenson
versus
bosler
which
required
counsel
on
appeal.
reaffirmed
in
1970,
mr.
stidham
sought
habeas
to
the
western
district
of
missouri
through
judge
collinson.
judge
collinson
dismissed
five
separate
grounds
it
was
appealed.
the
appeal
was
dismissed
by
mr.
stidham,
he
tried
to
reinstate
the
appeal
on
the
court
did
not
allow
the
reinstatement.
he
filed
a
second
habeas
corpus
petition
before
judge
collinson.
judge
collinson
on
relying
upon
the
former
opinion
denied
it
and
also
denied
a
new
issue
involving
coleman
versus
alabama.
of
the
five
issues
that
then
went
to
the
eighth
circuit,
four
were
affirmed,
one
the
jackson
v.
denno
issue
was
found
by
two-to-one
vote
to
be
that
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
their
review
of
missouri
case
law
demonstrated
that
the
missouri
trial
court
had
and
frequently
used
the
right
to
submit
the
question
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury
without
a
prior
determination
independently
by
the
judge
of
voluntariness.
in
essence,
i
feel
that
the
eighth
circuit
clearly
has
held
the
missouri
rule
as
the
same
as
in
new
york
rule.
under
jackson
which
was
struck
down
the
judge
could
not
exclude
a
confession,
if
there
were
circumstance
which
indicated
testimony
on
both
sides.
he
was
not
entitled
to
exclude
a
confession
merely
because
he
himself
would
have
found
it
involuntary.
in
essence,
he
was
without
judicial
power
to
resolve
the
conflicting
evidence
on
voluntariness.
this
court
held
that
the
defendant
had
the
right
at
some
point
to
a
hearing
and
a
determination
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
and
the
court
expressed
the
opinion
not
to
give
the
jury
the
dual
function
of
deciding
voluntariness
and
the
factual
history
did
not
give
the
defendant
constitutional
determination
that
he
was
due.
now
because
of
the
way
that
the
eighth
circuit
read
the
missouri
procedure,
we’ve
dealt
extensively
with
all
cases
beginning
from
1829
when
it
became
a
state.
hector
a
slave
versus
the
state
all
the
way
through
up
to
the
most
recent
cases.
basically,
i
think
distilling
those
cases
indicates
that
the
missouri
procedure
contemplated
a
preliminary
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
that
at
that
hearing
the
state
had
the
burden
of
non-persuasion.
after
that
hearing,
the
court
could
waive
the
evidence
and
find
the
confession
involuntary
and
refused
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury;
or
the
court
could
find
the
confession,
competent
evidence,
instruct
the
jury
on
their
duty
to
find
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
and
instruct
on
their
duty
to
find
that
if
they
find
that
if
they
found
it
was
voluntary
they
then
had
the
second
determination
to
make
whether
they
thought
it
was
true
and
they
believe
it.
now
the
eighth
circuit
quotes
rather
deafly
i
believe
with
the
use
of
ellipsis
from
different
cases
in
missouri
as
their
basic
reasons
for
saying
the
missouri
procedure
was
bad.
one
of
those
cases,
state
versus
bradford
at
the
part
in
the
opinion
just
before
the
court
gets
into
what
is
admittedly
equivocal
language
and
it’s
pretty
difficult
to
determine
exactly
what
the
procedure
is,
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
this,
“the
court
is
not
obliged
to
submit
the
issue
of
voluntariness
of
a
confession
to
a
jury
merely
because
there
were
substantial
evidence
tending
to
show
the
confession
was
voluntary,
however
much
the
evidence
of
its
voluntary
character
is
outweigh
by
the
evidence
to
the
contrary.”
now
after
that
portion
follows
some
equivocal
language
which
the
court
sets
out
which
indicates
that
but
the
better
rule
is
that,
if
there
is
a
real
close
question,
just
let
it
go
to
the
jury.
now,
the
question
is
what’s
that
mean
and
my
answer
is
it’s
pretty
hard
to
tell.
i
don’t
believe
it
means
exactly
what
the
eighth
circuit
say.
i
don’t
believe
that
is
the
exact
way
the
new
york
procedure
worked
and
the
other
thing,
the
other
case
that
leads
me
to
that
conclusion
is
state
versus
gibraltar
which
they
also
quote,
the
court
there
says
“that
it
is
not
the
law
that
if
there
be
any
substantial
evidence
indicating
the
confession
was
voluntary
the
court
must
and
the
emphasis
in
our
brief
is
the
court’s
emphasis
must
refer
the
question
to
the
jury
however
much
may
be
outweighed
by
evidence
to
the
contrary.”
if
that
were
true,
the
court
would
be
doing
no
more
that
always
does
throughout
the
trial
in
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
and
there
would
be
no
need
of
such
preliminary
hearings
except
in
the
rare
instances
when
such
evidence
is
wholly
likely.
now,
here
is
where
the
equivocation
starts
as
it
happened
in
the
last
case.
on
the
other
hand,
when
there
is
substantial
conflicting
evidence
and
the
question
is
closed.
it
is
better
to
refer
the
underlying
issue
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury
than
to
exclude
the
confession
and
they
go
on
with
some
language
about
miscarriage
of
justice
if
this
is
not
done.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no
sir,
to
the
extent
that
might
be
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
my
questions,
presumably
that’s
it.
i
go
one
step
further
and
said,
“no
matter
what
the
law
in
missouri
might
have
been
in
1955
we
have
to
determine
what
this
judge
did
on
the
facts
before
him.”
that
is
why
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
made
a
mistake,
because
if
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct
at
the
judge
on
the
record
find
said
“i
make
the
finding
that
this
confession
was
voluntary
as
a
matter
of
law
if
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct”
no
matter
that
wouldn’t
have
been
a
proper
finding.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
yes
sir,
that’s
what
i
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
right.
that
i
believe
is
a
basic
issue
not
necessarily
so
much
what
the
missouri
procedure
may
or
may
not
have
been.
i
meant
that
might
be
a
nice
intellectual
inquire
but
frankly
i
am
concerned
that
in
this
particular
case
that
we
hold
or
that
the
court
holds,
that
the
procedure
that
this
judge
used,
the
words
this
judge
used
after
the
inquiry
that
was
made
was
sufficient
under
jackson
versus
denno.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
in
a
particular
case
where
the
law
is
perhaps
unclear
as
the
court
indicates
at
least
two
members
of
the
court
indicated
they
felt
this
was,
perhaps
that
is
a
proper
inquiry
but
i
think
on
the
particular
reason
that
we’re
here
today
that
that’s
not
the
proper
inquiry.
basically,
i
guess
the
most
charitable
thing,
perhaps
the
worst
thing
that
could
be
said
for
all
these
cases
is
that
a
basic
general
rule
could
not
be
established
and
the
early
cases
up
to
about
1930
clearly
indicate
the
judge
made
the
decision.
there
are
some
equivocation
and
some
of
the
cases
after
that
and
i
think
the
--
especially
if
you
read
state
versus
laster,
you’ll
find
a
case
where
the
attorney
comes
in
and
he
will
not
put
on
any
evidence
and
so
there
up
crops
what’s
called
the
prima
facie
rule
which
that
puts
language
in
the
cases
that
the
next
time
a
judge
uses,
i
don’t
think
the
correct
factual
circumstances.
in
this
case,
mr.
hennelly
who
was
a
vigorous
trial
lawyer,
as
i
believe,
the
transcripts
will
indicate
requested
of
the
judge
a
second
judge
coming
in
from
another
circuit.
the
case
was
being
heard
on
a
change
of
venue,
i
would
say
approximately
250
to
300
miles
away
from
the
state
penitentiary
county
that
it
is
in.
he
requested
testimony
on
the
confession,
the
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury
that
was
given.
now
the
language
we
specifically
set
out
in
the
brief.
the
first
time
that
one
of
the
officers
gets
up
to
testify
about
the
confession,
mr.
hennelly
indicates
at
this
point
your
honor
if
it
please,
the
defendant
moves
the
court
to
conduct
a
preliminary
hearing
and
asks
the
court
to
inquire
to
the

the
statement
and
to
determine
whether
the
statement
was
given
voluntarily
either
the
oral
or
the
written
statement
and
we
ask
that
the
hearing
be
held
outside
the
jury.
that

and
covers

80-85
pages
of
the
transcript.
all
the
officers
testify,
the
defendants
testifies
and
at
the
end
of
that
mr.
hennelly
indicates
that
is
all,
that
is
the
defendants
motion.
then
the
court’s
language
which
has,
perhaps
what’s
caused
the
confusion
is
now
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury
the
request
by
the
defendant
for
a
hearing
upon
a
statement
which
has
been
identified
as
1616.
it
is
the
court’s
opinion
that
the
matters
concerning
the
statements
should
be
offered
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
subject
of
course
to
any
attacks
as
to
its
credibility
by
the
defendant.
the
defendant
has
of
course
the
right
to
proceed
to
challenge
the
voluntariness
of
the
statements
and
confession
even
before
the
jury.
but
it
is
the
court’s
opinion
and
upon
the
evidence
that
has
been
offered
before
the
court
and
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury
that
the
statement
is
and
should
be
admissible,
then
he
follows
with
some
other
non-appropriate
language.
mr.
hennelly
merely
jumps
off
and
says
“in
other
words,
the
court
is
over
ruling
my
motion.”
and
request
that
the
court
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
statements
were
involuntary
is
that
right?
the
court,
“that
is
right.”
he
brings
him
back
in,
now
of
course
if
you
accept
what
the
eighth
circuit
says
the
law
was,
that’s
--
that
can
be
read
two
ways.
the
one
way,
the
way
that
we
say
it
should
be
read.
the
other
way,
the
way
mr.
hennelly
says
it
should
be
read
to
the
extent
that
okay,
he
is
equivocating.
if
he
was
trying
to
make
the
decision
as
well
as
there
is
enough
evidence
here
that
may
be
ought
not
to
rule
it
goes.
i
think
it’s
clear
from
the
judge’s
actions
here
that
he
is
saying
“i
don’t
believe
a
word
stidham
is
saying.”
he
has
decided
credibility,
that’s
what
we
are
talking
about
in
jackson,
has
this
man
ever
had
the
credibility
of
his
voluntariness
decided
before
the
jury
gets
it
in
that
mixed
nature
of
trying
to
decide
whether
it
is
truthful
and
whether
it
happened.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
true.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
there
was
some
changing
of
testimony
but
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
true,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
true.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
it
wouldn’t.
the
only
trouble
your
honor
is
with
what
the
judge
said,
we
are
again
hang-up
in
semantics.
the
judge
did
not
say
“i
view
the
evidence,
i
find
it
voluntary.”
he
said
“i
view
the
evidence”
the
judge
in
1955
found
it
voluntary
as
he
should
have,
so
it
is
not
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right,
he
did.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
think
it
certainly
is
and
we
argue
that,
we
also
have
argued
that
the
determination
that
the
supreme
court
made
on
appeal
was
sufficient
on
the
judges,
on
the
reinstated
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
judge
collinson
said
it
was
voluntary.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
those
words,
all
of
the
words
in
there
or
mr.
hennelly’s
words,
the
judge
only
rules,
he
did
not
say
voluntary
nor
not
involuntary.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
he
doesn’t
say
anything.
he
says,
“i
am
going
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury.”
mr.
hennelly
then
says
“are
you
overruling
my
motion
that
it
is
not
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law?”
he
says
“correct,
call
in
the
next
witness.”
so
he
actually
uses
none
of
the
phrases
or
the
magic
rubric
as
judge
gibson
says,
he
does
not
indicate
that.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
he
could
have.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
correct.
he
had
that
power.
that’s
how
we
distinguish
it
from
the
new
york
rule
which
as
i
read
some
of
those
cases
it
seems
to
indicate
that
once
those
conflicting
evidence,
he
didn’t
have
the
power
to
take
it
away
from
the
jury.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that's
probably
--
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
true.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
the
eighth
circuit
recognize
under
sigler
versus
parker
that
it
had
to
be
a
determination
that
while
they
send
it
back
to
the
western
district
court,
it
was
only
the
whole
lot
case
until
new
proceedings
should
be
instituted
in
missouri,
which
evidently
indicates
a
third
collateral
attack
proceeding
in
missouri
for
mr.
stidham.
basically,
we
make
the
argument
that
the
supreme
court
on
appeal
and
particularly
the
judge
in
st.
louis
on
the
collateral
attack
hearing
on
the
27
and
26
have
made
a
sufficient
determination
under
jackson
and
on
our
brief
we
also
indicate
and
we
do
not
wish
to
waive
those
arguments
regarding
the
retroactivity
of
the
cases
although
it
is
pretty
difficult
to
plan
the
phase
of
jackson
which
we
apply
retroactively
to
a
habeas
case.
we
believe
that
it
should
not
apply
collaterally
standards
are
not
viable
at
the
time
of
the
original
appellate
review
of
the
court.
perhaps
and
i
have
heard
that
argument
made
into
two
or
three
other
cases
in
the
last
couple
of
days,
it
is
a
dog
that
won’t
hunt
but
we
believe
that
it
should
hunt.
it’s
a
problem
i
have
handled
in
the
office
three
years
and
i
have
handled
14,075
petitions
responses
to
show
off.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that’s
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
in
three
years.
i
went
through
and
i
didn’t
believe
it.
the
more
the
docket
cards
i
went
through
the
more
the
numbers
came
up.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that
takes
in
the
western
and
the
eastern
district.
481
of
those
have
been
appealed,
84
have
been
reversed
and
only
one
in
this
case
have
i
had
a
gut
reaction
and
it’s
fairly
difficult
to
tell
exactly
what
it
is
but
it
is
a
lot
of
little
things
and
i
just
think
there
is
something
wrong
and
this
can
go
on
after
this
man
has
had
this
number
of
hearings
and
i
think
it
should
it
stop.
we
also
make
an
argument
in
the
brief.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
would
stop
it
right
here.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
i
am
not
concerned
with
that
and
i
will
try
to
deal
with
the
next
point.
the
other
part
of
our
argument
was
that
this
man
had
an
original
habeas.
it
went
to
the
eighth
circuit,
he
dismissed
his
appeal
or
basically
the
same
issues
except
for
the
coleman
v.
alabama
issue
which
he
brought
up
later
but
he
tried
to
reinstate
his
appeal.
the
eighth
circuit
said
no.
that
should
have
been
the
end
of
it
for
mr.
stidham
on
this
issue.
now
he
filed
a
second
habeas
corpus
in
the
western
district.
mr.
collinson
denied
him
relief
basing
it
on
his
prior
decision
and
also
denied
him
relief
on
coleman
versus
alabama.
it
goes
up
then
the
eighth
circuit
and
there
have
been
other
cases
involving
the
same
missouri
procedure
which
they’ve
not
felt
concerned
enough
to
tell
us
about
in
the
last
few
years
since
jackson
v.
denno.
in
this
case,
two
members
on
that
panel
decided
that
the
missouri
law
was
incorrectly
being
applied.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
we
did
not
have
oral
argument
your
honor.
we
opened
a
summary
docket.
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
yes,
sir
and
he
was
the
judge
that
dissented.
his
basis
being
that
missouri
supreme
court
is
the
one
to
judge
what
the
law
of
missouri
was
and
he
was
the
only
missouri
judge
on
that
three-man
panel.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
think
i
told
the
court
that
he
was
impressive
trial
lawyer,
he
is.
two
things
i
might
mention,
one
on
exactly
what
the
eighth
circuit
did
with
the
case.
they
sent
it
back
for
a
hearing
in
the
state
court
under
sigler
versus
parker.
i
am
not
sure
that
was
correct
because
they
did
not
indicate
what
new
facts
there
are
to
be
determined.
it
looks
to
me
like
there
is
sufficient
record
on
both
the
original
trial
and
the
27-26
to
determine
what
all
the
facts
were.
i
am
not
convinced
as
is
mr.
hennelly,
some
judge
perhaps
even
this
court
under
boulden
versus
holman
could
not
just
sit
and
look
at
the
facts.
i
think
clearly
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
could
take
that
cold
record
and
on
the
authority
under
boulden
versus
holman
and
jackson
itself
say
this
confession
is
voluntary.
now
as
to
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
concerning
the
testimony,
i
believe
that
pages
770
and
771
of
the
appendix.
the
court
indicates
that
they
are
merely
indulging
themselves
in
procunier
versus
ashley
which
says
that
“if
we
were
to
believe
mr.
stidham’s
facts,
clearly
he
would
be
due
some
relief.”
they’ve
not
said
they
believe
him,
all
they
said
is
that
for
the
purposes
of
testing
whether
the
five
or
six
allegations
he
make
on
their
face
would
grant
him
relief.
if
they
were
true,
we
will
not
apply
procunier,
we
will
send
this
back,
we
will
not
say
it
was
involuntary
and
we
will
also
not
say
that
it
was
voluntary.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
they
requested
a
letter
from
me
sometime
in
early
april
specifically
referring
to
the
fact
that
they
have
not
had
anything
to
eat
or
drink
and
requested
transcript
references.
i
sent
what
i
thought
were
appropriate
transcript
references
back
to
him
and
also
some
fairly
inflammatory
argument
as
to
exactly
what
they
wanted.
they
were
concerned
about
his
testimonies
to
loss
of
weight.
he
testified
that
and
this
is
at
the
27
and
26
now,
he
testifies
that
he
lost
25
pounds
during
a
six-day
period.
then
he
testified
that
he
was
not
given
anything
to
eat.
other
than
that,
they
did
not
indicate
in
their
letter
for
the
most
two
things
exactly
what
these
other
loose
ends
are
and
of
course
as
we
have
indicated
on
a
footnote
you
are
going
to
have
loose
ends
in
every
case
that’s
tried
and
certainly
it
is
not
the
law
that
you
have
to
present
rebuttal
testimony
to
every
allegation
a
man
makes
before
you
can
determine
credibility,
and
that’s
all
that
i
think
is
basically
involved
there.
judge
collinson
was
able
to
determine
credibility
with
the
same
loose
ends
as
were
all
the
other
courts.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
you
mean
what
do
i
know
or
what
does
the
record
believe?
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
the
judge
at
the
case
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
okay,
one
of
the
officers
at
the
27
to
26
testified,
all
of
the
police
officers
are
high
and
prominent
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
oh,
yes,
he
said
that
the
cell
did
not
contain
water
but
when
we
went
there
was
a
bunk
that
the
man
did
not
look
like
he
was
hungry.
he
did
not
show
any
signs
of
beating
as
the
doctor
indicated
he
had
subjective
complaints
but
nothing
objective
other
than
a
rugged
scar
between
this
finger
and
this
finger
of
his
ring
hand.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates
that
he
had
been
there
20
months.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right,
before
escape.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
no,
there
is
nothing
that
indicates
there
are
no
cockroaches.
i
mean
no
one
was
asked
of
silly
question,
did
you
see
a
cockroach
instead
of
volunteers.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
oh,
if
i
were
to
bring
it,
i
think
the
first
question
i
would
asks
somebody
if
i
could
find
somebody
would
be
that
question
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
we
have
here
today
that
indicates
that
there
were
no
cockroaches,
that
is
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that
is
the
law,
your
honor.
now
the
20-month
period
that
he
was
in
maximum
security.
he
was
in
maximum
security
for
an
attempted
escape.
now
the
record
indicates
20
months.
i
have
not
done
any
independent
research
that
indicates
anything
different.
clearly
he
has
been
down
there
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
where
this
differs
from
some
of
the
cases
involving
missouri,
he
was
not
in
maximum
security
looking
toward
an
eventual
confession
as
was
the
other
case.
he
was
there
for
a
legitimate
concern,
escape.
in
the
first
few
words
in
the
judge
barrett
opinion
indicate
this
man’s
name
is
slick
stidham
and
he
is
not
called
slick
stidham
because
he
is
straight.
they
had
even
maximum
security
for
an
escape,
he
was
not
there
looking
toward
anything
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
that
is
right,
behind
his
back.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
romines
