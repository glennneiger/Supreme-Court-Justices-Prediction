on
the
proceeding
page
that
you
quoted
from
and
then
quoted
another
pair
of
page,
86-85
and
i
take
it
this
is
still
the
opinion
of
the
missouri
habeas
judge.
the
last
paragraph
it
says
“movant’s
contention
at
the
trial
court
failed
to
find
specifically
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
this
court
finds
is
unattainable
since
the
court
found
specifically
that
the
confession
was
not
involuntary.”
now
if
a
court
finds
specifically
that
the
confession
is
not
involuntary,
that’s
tantamount
to
finding
a
voluntary,
isn’t
it?
justice
harry

but
he
is
at
least
characterizing
the
finding
of
the
original
missouri
trial
judges,
the
finding
that
it
was
not
involuntary.
