justice
potter
stewart
is
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
and
the
basic
question,
what
was
the
law
of
missouri
in
1955
with
respect
to
procedure
in
handling
alleged
course
confessions?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
you
suggest
the
judge
very
clearly
had
complied
in
1955
was
what
the
jackson
against
denno
decided
many
years
later,
you
said
the
eighth
circuit
would
have
said,
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
because
the
law
of
missouri
didn’t
require
to
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that
you
say
it
is
the
basic
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
preliminary,
that
inquiry
that
what
you
interesting
intellectual
inquiry
as
to
what
was
the
law
of
missouri
in
1955
should
i
suppose
you
would
agree
normally
in
our
judicial
process
be
left
for
the
determination
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
not
in
business
here
to
decide
what
the
state
law
is.
justice
potter
stewart
now
could
i
ask
the
question
please.
let’s
assume
that
jackson
was
violated
or
wasn’t
followed
or
that
the
procedure
that
jackson
thinks
a
trial
judge
should
follow
wasn’t
followed
at
the
trial,
the
criminal
trial.
the
defendant
is
then
not
entitled
to
a
new
trial
necessarily
but
just
to
a
hearing
of
the
voluntariness
of
his
confession,
isn’t
true?
justice
potter
stewart
now
after
he
was
convicted
he
was
given
another
full
hearing
in
the
state
court,
was
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
are
no
new
witnesses
called
or
anything
i
take
it?
justice
potter
stewart
changing
of
testimony
but
there
was
a
full
opportunity
for
a
hearing
and
the
counsel
per
same
for
some
--
for
all
intensive
purposes
the
case
was
submitted
on
practically
the
same
evidence,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
state
trial
judge
that
was
conducting
that
collateral
hearing
denied
relief?
justice
potter
stewart
now
if
that
were
a
determination
that
the
confession
was
voluntary,
it
really
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
what
the
procedure
was
at
the
trial
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
went
on
and
said
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
he
thought
the
--
if
he
thought
the
judge
the
term
that
voluntary
said
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
it,
do
you
think
that’s
a
determination
of
voluntariness?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes,
because
there,
the
court
did
say
it
was
voluntary.
justice
potter
stewart
the
trial
judge
could
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
his
claims
were
having
this
business
of
being
lifted
off
the
floor
by
his
handcuff,
isn’t
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the

in
this
