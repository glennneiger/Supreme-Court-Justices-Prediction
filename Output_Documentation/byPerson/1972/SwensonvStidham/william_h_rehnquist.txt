well,
mr.
romines
isn’t
also
perhaps
equally
a
fundamental
issue
in
the
case
of
the
proper
application
of
this
court’s
holding
in
jackson
against
denno
to
whatever
in
fact
happened
in
the
missouri
trial
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
romines,
if
the
case
had
come
here
on
direct
appeal
or
certiorari
from
the
affirmance
on
direct
appeal
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
and
we
have
concluded
that
this
colloquy
between
mr.
hennelly
and
the
trial
judge
did
not
satisfy
denno.
we
would
have
sent
it
back
to
the
missouri
courts
i
suppose
for
much
the
same
type
of
hearing
that
mr.
stidham
obtained
in
his
missouri
habeas
proceedings.

to
federal
habeas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
that
just
the
western
district?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
citation
of
the
record
so
we
could
follow
along?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
you
go
back
for
a
hearing
before
judge
collinson
or
one
of
the
other
judges
in
the
western
district
since
presumably
the
petitioner
is
exhausted
as
may
served?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
certainly
did
not
bring
the
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
for
a
factual
determination
as
to
whether
this
particular
confession
was
involuntary
mr.
hennelly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
eighth
circuit
didn’t
make
any
factual
determination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
it
said
was
it
should
go
back
for
a
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn’t
cross-petition
for
certiorari
did
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn’t
that
foreclose
you
from
arguing
for
any
relief
that
eighth
circuit
did
not
grant
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
did
also
say,
didn’t
they
that
we
have
examined
the
transcripts
and
other
relevant
materials
that
found
several
of
stidham’s
allegations
have
not
been
contradicted
in
the
record.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
majority
of
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
the
rule
in
missouri
as
it
is
elsewhere
that
the
finder
of
fact
is
entitled
to
disbelieve
an
interested
witness
without
the
necessity
of
contradicting
testimony
if
that
is
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
of
fact
that
he
is
not
telling
the
truth?
