mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
always
an
emotional
thing
to
--
we
would
like
to
do
away
with
as
many
appeals
as
possible.
unfortunately,
this
is
the
occupational
hazard
that
the
state
has
to
take
with
respect
to
innocence
and
that’s
the
situation
that
still
a
mistaken
for
almost
20
years.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we’re
going
to
say
to
mr.
stidham
the
dockets
are
too
loaded.
if
we
coerce
this
conviction,
confession
out
of
you,
it
is
most
unfortunate
because
we
have
too
much
work
to
do
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
--
of
any
of
the
laws.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it’s
the
seventh
time
it’s
been
before
some
type
of
court
your
honor
and
as
i
again
i
say
that’s
the
result
of
this
man’s
insistence
that
he
was
illegally
convicted.
we
would
not
be
here
if
judge
godfrey
who
heard
the
case
when
it
came
back
the
second
time,
if
he
had
done
exactly
what
the
court
said
should
have
been
done.
let
me
read
what
judge
godfrey
did.
judge
godfrey
says
“as
to
paragraph
b
concerning
the
averment
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
this
is
on
page
26
of
our
brief
at
the
appendix
686
page
26
of
our
brief.
“as
to
subparagraph
b
concerning
the
averment
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
was
that
the
statement
was
involuntary
because
of
coercion
exerted
on
movement.
this
contention
was
raised
and
profusely
litigated
in
state
versus
stidham
and
the
court
finds
it
is
no
longer
open
to
question
here.
judge
godfrey
made
no
finding
that
we
ask
him
to
make;
if
he
had
we
would
not
have
to
come
here.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes
but
he
went
on
further
than
that
too
your
honor,
i
will
read
the
whole
thing
that
he
said.
“it
should
be
noted
that
the
evidence
concerning
the
issue
of
voluntariness
was
greatly
conflicting
and
was
to
be
resolved
by
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance
and
the
jury
in
the
second
have
been
regard
to
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.”
this
issue
should
now
be
considered
closed.
it
should
not
be
considered
closed
and
the
court
finds
it
to
be
so.
in
other
words
all
that
he
did
was
to
put
a
stamp
of
approval
on
what
have
been
illegally
done
previously.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it
was
two
years
ago
your
honor.
in
other
words
it
was
we
tried
the
case
the
first
time
in
about
1955
and
then
the
sixth
appearance
was
before
judge
godfrey
and
judge
godfrey
clearly
did
not
make
the
finding
that
he
should
have
made
as
a
result
of
the
mandate
of
his
own
supreme
court.
now,
as
we
understand
jackson
v.
denno.
when
the
trial
is
over
a
defendant
ought
to
be
able
to
say
to
himself
“i
am
satisfied
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
this
jury
convicted
me
with
respect
to
a
statement
and
he
ought
to
be
able
to
say
“i
am
satisfied
that
the
court
--
the
court
found
that
it
was
voluntary”
and
he
ought
to
be
able
to
be
able
as
a
result
of
sims
v.
georgia
to
say
that
that
was
to
be
bound
with
unmistakable
clarity.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
your
honor
all
that
he
is
doing
is
restating
what
the
court
did
in
the
first
instance.
all
that
he
is
saying
is
“i’ve
read
the
decision
and
i
see
when
i
read
the
decision
that
the
court
found
that
it
was
involuntary.”
he
is
not
saying
that
based
upon
the
evidence
it
was
put
before
me
that
i
now
find
it
that
it
was
involuntary
and
if
he
did
we’d
be
dead
as
far
this
case
is
concerned
but
he
didn’t
do
that.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
i
don’t
think
that
he
is.
i
think
that
what
he
is
doing
is
going
back
to
and
while
i
realize
that
an
interpretation
is
to
what
was
the
law
in
missouri
at
the
time,
is
only
a
factor
to
be
considered
as
to
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
late
judge
webber
when
he
made
this
finding.
i
think
that
all
he
is
doing
is
saying
is
at
that
time
they
lived
up
to
what
the
law
was
in
missouri.
and
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
with
respect
to
the
material
that
mr.
romines
read.
at
the
time
that
i
asked
for
the
hearing,
i
asked
for
a
hearing
based
upon
both
the
oral
and
the
written
confession
and
you
will
note,
if
your
honors
will,
that
when
we
get
down
to
the
colloquy
as
to
are
you
finding
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
weren’t
talking
about
the
states
exhibit
16
and
161.
there
is
no
place
in
this
record;
there
is
no
court
that
has
ever
decided
that
the
oral
statements
which
were
objected
to
and
the
record
says
that
each
instance
on
the
oral
statement,
there
is
no
finding
in
any
place
in
this
record
that
the
oral
statements
were
voluntary.
now
again,
with
respect
to
the
statement
of
the
court
and
my
statement
you
are
not
finding
as
a
matter
of
law.
when
i
say
it
you
are
not
finding
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
am
saying
that
the
law
as
it
existed
then,
it
is
for
that
reason
that
is
of
some
importance
is
definitely
the
case
law
that
we
have
been
following
missouri
all
the
time.
and
the
case
law
that
we
have
been
following
in
missouri
was
chiefly
was
clearly
an
opposition
to
the
finding
that
this
court
made
in
jackson
v.
denno.
it
was
that
if
the
question
was
closed,
the
court
did
not
have
to
put
a
stamp
of
approval
on
it.
the
court
didn’t
have
to
make
a
positive
finding,
the
court
passed
it
on
to
the
jury
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
page
703
of
the
appendix,
that’s
exactly
what
the
supreme
court
said.
when
we
originally
tried
stidham
and
he
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
first
time,
the
supreme
court
says
there’s
no
merit
to
defendant’s
contention
that
his
written
confession,
his
written
confession,
they
do
not
even
worry
about
the
oral
statement
was
coerced
and
involuntary
and
was
admitted
an
evidence
before
the
state
established
that
it
had
been
voluntarily
given.
the
court
conducted
a
full
preliminary
hearing
on
the
issue,
found
the
issue
for
the
jury
and
later
after
hearing
evidence
before
the
jury
submitted
the
issue
to
the
jury
for
determination.
the
testimony
was
to
like
affect
to
each
hearing
so
on
and
so
forth,
the
last
thing
it
said
on
the
conflicting
showing
of
issue
of
voluntariness
of
the
confession
was
for
the
jury
which
is
totally
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
held.
the
court
should
have
done
with
respect
to
jackson
versus
denno
and
the
sims
case,
the
court
should
have
made
a
positive
unquestioned
finding
and
quite
frankly,
if
judge
godfrey
when
the
case
went
back
to
him,
if
he
would
have
done
it
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it
too
but
to
this
day,
nobody
has
made
that
finding
except
that
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
strongly
suggested
that
it
was
totally
involuntary
and
that
it
was
taken
and
if
we
took
the
uncontradicted
testimony
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
and
should
have
been
excluded
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
the
consequence
is
that
it’s
now
here
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
the
consequence
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
if
had
not
come
here
and
if
the
state
have
not
applied
for
cert,
it
would
have
gone
back
for
another
hearing
to
determine
the
voluntariness
of
the
statement
and
i
presume
that
some
other
judge
realizing
that
he
had
to
conform
with
jackson
versus
denno
and
the
sims
case
would
have
said
“i
have
heard
this
evidence,
i
find
it
to
be
voluntary”
and
that
would
have
been
it.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
to
another
state
court.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i
don’t
know
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
judge.
now
i
think
that
we
can
look
at
this
record
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
only
in
voluntary.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
we
get
a
new
trial
and
they
try
it
with
whatever
evidence
they
have
independent
of
the
confession.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it
was
indicted
in
about
november
of
1954
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
see
that
the
riot,
it
was
a
penitentiary
riot
in
september
of
1954
and
he
was
the
--
it
was
first
in
information
issued
against
them
and
then
they
indicted
him.
now
it
is
our
contention
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it
got
back
to
him
because
the
supreme
court
found,
the
missouri
supreme
court
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
should
have
a
hearing
on
the
post
--
on
the
2726
motion
which
is
our
post
conviction
device
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
confession
was
voluntary
together
with
some
other
matters.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
he
did
not.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
would
have
been
satisfied.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it
was
judge
webber.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
in
effect
he
says
“i
cannot
that’s
res
judicata
problem”
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
what
it
is.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
except
your
honor
that
i
can’t
recall
the
case
but
i
understand
that
one
of
the
cases
indicate
that
another
as
judge
cannot
read
a
record
and
determine
the
demeanor
of
the
witness,
etcetera.
it
may
well
be
that
the
case
could
be
remanded
to
judge
godfrey
and
ask
judge
godfrey
to
correct
his
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i
don’t
think
that
would
conform
with
jackson
v.
doe,
because
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
who
has
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
has
the
atmosphere
of
the
case.
it
is
he
who
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
confession
is
voluntary.
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
do
it.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i’m
sorry?
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
he
is
and
believe
me
judge
webber
with
all
due
respect
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
no
i
don’t.
i
say
that
you
could
send
it
back
to
another
judge
who
can
hear
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
now.
just
as
i
say
judge
godfrey
could
have
done
it.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well
it
was
just
a
year
and
a
half,
two
years
ago
that
there
was
a
reasonably
full
hearing
after
18
years.
but
i
think
that
we
are
losing
sight
of
what
is
the
main
thrust
of
stidham’s
position
in
this
case
and
what
is
suggested
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
that
this
confession
should
have
been
thrown
out
completely.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
i
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i
said
that
is
not
sufficient.
no,
i
don’t
and
really
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
that
we
have
got
to
realize
that
mr.
stidham
has
his
characterized
in
this
and
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
is
a
litigious
convict
and
again
that
litigiousness
is
it
was
a
by-product
of
innocence
perhaps.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
he
is
a
litigious,
i
make
no
bones
about
that
and
when
i
was
first
appointed
to
defend
this
man.
the
first
thing
that
he
asked
me
was
to
file
a
motion
for
a
lie
detector
test.
he
has
maintained
his
innocence
from
the
very
beginning,
that
was
18
years
ago,
he
has
asked
for
every
kind
of
relief.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
i
tried
the
case
in
the
first
instance
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
i
was
appointed
by
the
court
and
i
tried
the
case
18
years
ago
and
i
have
been
with
him
for
18
years.
now,
but
the
real
thrust
in
this
case
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
the
real
thrust
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
this
confession
was
in
fact
involuntary.
now,
let
us
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
i
certainly
think
that
it’s
a
proper
place
to
determine
it
for
once
and
for
all
as
to
whether
or
not
they
didn’t
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
beating
a
confession
out
of
this
defendant.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
the
eighth
circuit
--
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
the
eighth
circuit
also
says
that
if
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case
is
true
that
that
confession
was
involuntary.
now
i
say
that
they
should
have
gone
further,
they
should
have
said
in
fact
--
they
should
have
said
it
looks
like
it
is
involuntary,
they
should
have
said
as
a
matter
of
lie
is
involuntary
and
we
do
not
put
our
stamp
of
approval
on
it.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
i
did
not
and
i’ll
tell
you,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i
leave
it
to
the
court,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
now
with
respect
to
the
as
to
whether
or
not
--
even
if
this
court,
even
if
this
court
have
satisfied
jackson
v.
denno.
if
the
original
court
have
satisfied
jackson
v.
denno,
if
we
tried
this
court
yesterday
and
this
court
and
the
judge
who
tried
that
case
as
the
trial
of
the
facts,
if
he
have
found
that
the
confession
under
this
circumstances
was
in
fact
voluntary,
we
would
be
here
today
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
writ
of
habeas
corpus
asking
you
to
find
it
involuntary
for
the
following
reasons.
this
is
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case,
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case
when
taken
in
the
light
of
a
long
line
of
cases
which
this
court
has
already
ruled
on
brooks,
close
and
a
number
of
other
cases
as
follows.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
this
is
on
page
3
of
my
brief.
during
the
last
two
months
from
july
2,
1954
until
september
24,
stidham
was
confined
in
death
row
under
substantially
the
same
solitary
confinement
conditions
he
had
previously
undergone
with
the
exception
he
stated
that
on
death
row
he
was
not
provided
with
a
bunk
but
slept
on
a
straw
tick.
excuse
me.
i
am
sorry
if
the
court
would
turn
to
page
9,
i
apologize,
page
9,
the
bottom
of
page
9.
prior
to
giving
a
statement,
stidham
had
been
confined
in
solitary
confinement
for
20
months.
this
is
the
undisputed
testimony
to
the
solitary
confinement
had
for
the
most
part
been
on
a
cell
measuring
5
feet
x
7
feet
with
furnishings
consisting
of
a
wash
basin,
toilet,
steel
bunk
and
straw
tick
and
an
area
infested
with
cockroaches
and
rodents
and
with
ventilation
so
poor
that
stidham
passed
out
on
several
occasions.
and
i
might
tell
the
court
that
in
the
original
trial
he
told
the
court
that
the
conditions
in
that
penitentiary
were
so
bad
that
the
fbi
had
come
to
investigate
it
and
at
the
time
that
we
tried
the
post
conviction
motion
in
front
of
judge
godfrey
he
said
it
again,
and
during
all
of
that
time
there
has
been
no
attempt
made
to
contradict
that
testimony.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
on
jackson
v.
denno.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
i
don’t
your
honor
but
i
have
this
poor
guy
for
18
years,
so
i
naturally
--
i
maybe
a
little
bit
prejudice
but
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
will
tell
you.
the
distinguished
judge
gibson
who
is
a
fine
judge
and
who
made
mention
of
the
fact
of
that
the
courts
are
loaded
down
just
as
mr.
romines
made
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
courts
are
loaded
down.
i
will
tell
you
with
--
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
if
all
we
do
is
go
back
to
a
trial
court
and
have
judge
godfrey
or
some
other
judge
listen
to
this
testimony
and
make
the
finding
that
this
confession
was
given
voluntarily,
then
i
tell
you
that
your
courts
will
be
burdened
again
because
we
will
take
it
again
through
a
whole
series
of
steps
because
of
the
fact
that
this
particular
findings
and
the
way
this
man
was
treated
so
shocks
the
conscience
of
anybody
who
wants
to
give
a
man
a
fair
trial
that
will
be
back
up
here
again
in
a
couple
of
years
with
it
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
best
way
to
do
it
is
to
make
that
determination
today
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
facts
on
this
case
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
whether
or
not
this
confession
was
involuntary.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
thank
you.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
always
an
emotional
thing
to
--
we
would
like
to
do
away
with
as
many
appeals
as
possible.
unfortunately,
this
is
the
occupational
hazard
that
the
state
has
to
take
with
respect
to
innocence
and
that’s
the
situation
that
still
a
mistaken
for
almost
20
years.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we’re
going
to
say
to
mr.
stidham
the
dockets
are
too
loaded.
if
we
coerce
this
conviction,
confession
out
of
you,
it
is
most
unfortunate
because
we
have
too
much
work
to
do
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
--
of
any
of
the
laws.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it’s
the
seventh
time
it’s
been
before
some
type
of
court
your
honor
and
as
i
again
i
say
that’s
the
result
of
this
man’s
insistence
that
he
was
illegally
convicted.
we
would
not
be
here
if
judge
godfrey
who
heard
the
case
when
it
came
back
the
second
time,
if
he
had
done
exactly
what
the
court
said
should
have
been
done.
let
me
read
what
judge
godfrey
did.
judge
godfrey
says
“as
to
paragraph
b
concerning
the
averment
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
this
is
on
page
26
of
our
brief
at
the
appendix
686
page
26
of
our
brief.
“as
to
subparagraph
b
concerning
the
averment
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
was
that
the
statement
was
involuntary
because
of
coercion
exerted
on
movement.
this
contention
was
raised
and
profusely
litigated
in
state
versus
stidham
and
the
court
finds
it
is
no
longer
open
to
question
here.
judge
godfrey
made
no
finding
that
we
ask
him
to
make;
if
he
had
we
would
not
have
to
come
here.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes
but
he
went
on
further
than
that
too
your
honor,
i
will
read
the
whole
thing
that
he
said.
“it
should
be
noted
that
the
evidence
concerning
the
issue
of
voluntariness
was
greatly
conflicting
and
was
to
be
resolved
by
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance
and
the
jury
in
the
second
have
been
regard
to
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.”
this
issue
should
now
be
considered
closed.
it
should
not
be
considered
closed
and
the
court
finds
it
to
be
so.
in
other
words
all
that
he
did
was
to
put
a
stamp
of
approval
on
what
have
been
illegally
done
previously.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it
was
two
years
ago
your
honor.
in
other
words
it
was
we
tried
the
case
the
first
time
in
about
1955
and
then
the
sixth
appearance
was
before
judge
godfrey
and
judge
godfrey
clearly
did
not
make
the
finding
that
he
should
have
made
as
a
result
of
the
mandate
of
his
own
supreme
court.
now,
as
we
understand
jackson
v.
denno.
when
the
trial
is
over
a
defendant
ought
to
be
able
to
say
to
himself
“i
am
satisfied
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
this
jury
convicted
me
with
respect
to
a
statement
and
he
ought
to
be
able
to
say
“i
am
satisfied
that
the
court
--
the
court
found
that
it
was
voluntary”
and
he
ought
to
be
able
to
be
able
as
a
result
of
sims
v.
georgia
to
say
that
that
was
to
be
bound
with
unmistakable
clarity.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
your
honor
all
that
he
is
doing
is
restating
what
the
court
did
in
the
first
instance.
all
that
he
is
saying
is
“i’ve
read
the
decision
and
i
see
when
i
read
the
decision
that
the
court
found
that
it
was
involuntary.”
he
is
not
saying
that
based
upon
the
evidence
it
was
put
before
me
that
i
now
find
it
that
it
was
involuntary
and
if
he
did
we’d
be
dead
as
far
this
case
is
concerned
but
he
didn’t
do
that.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
i
don’t
think
that
he
is.
i
think
that
what
he
is
doing
is
going
back
to
and
while
i
realize
that
an
interpretation
is
to
what
was
the
law
in
missouri
at
the
time,
is
only
a
factor
to
be
considered
as
to
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
late
judge
webber
when
he
made
this
finding.
i
think
that
all
he
is
doing
is
saying
is
at
that
time
they
lived
up
to
what
the
law
was
in
missouri.
and
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
with
respect
to
the
material
that
mr.
romines
read.
at
the
time
that
i
asked
for
the
hearing,
i
asked
for
a
hearing
based
upon
both
the
oral
and
the
written
confession
and
you
will
note,
if
your
honors
will,
that
when
we
get
down
to
the
colloquy
as
to
are
you
finding
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
weren’t
talking
about
the
states
exhibit
16
and
161.
there
is
no
place
in
this
record;
there
is
no
court
that
has
ever
decided
that
the
oral
statements
which
were
objected
to
and
the
record
says
that
each
instance
on
the
oral
statement,
there
is
no
finding
in
any
place
in
this
record
that
the
oral
statements
were
voluntary.
now
again,
with
respect
to
the
statement
of
the
court
and
my
statement
you
are
not
finding
as
a
matter
of
law.
when
i
say
it
you
are
not
finding
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
am
saying
that
the
law
as
it
existed
then,
it
is
for
that
reason
that
is
of
some
importance
is
definitely
the
case
law
that
we
have
been
following
missouri
all
the
time.
and
the
case
law
that
we
have
been
following
in
missouri
was
chiefly
was
clearly
an
opposition
to
the
finding
that
this
court
made
in
jackson
v.
denno.
it
was
that
if
the
question
was
closed,
the
court
did
not
have
to
put
a
stamp
of
approval
on
it.
the
court
didn’t
have
to
make
a
positive
finding,
the
court
passed
it
on
to
the
jury
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
page
703
of
the
appendix,
that’s
exactly
what
the
supreme
court
said.
when
we
originally
tried
stidham
and
he
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
for
the
first
time,
the
supreme
court
says
there’s
no
merit
to
defendant’s
contention
that
his
written
confession,
his
written
confession,
they
do
not
even
worry
about
the
oral
statement
was
coerced
and
involuntary
and
was
admitted
an
evidence
before
the
state
established
that
it
had
been
voluntarily
given.
the
court
conducted
a
full
preliminary
hearing
on
the
issue,
found
the
issue
for
the
jury
and
later
after
hearing
evidence
before
the
jury
submitted
the
issue
to
the
jury
for
determination.
the
testimony
was
to
like
affect
to
each
hearing
so
on
and
so
forth,
the
last
thing
it
said
on
the
conflicting
showing
of
issue
of
voluntariness
of
the
confession
was
for
the
jury
which
is
totally
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
held.
the
court
should
have
done
with
respect
to
jackson
versus
denno
and
the
sims
case,
the
court
should
have
made
a
positive
unquestioned
finding
and
quite
frankly,
if
judge
godfrey
when
the
case
went
back
to
him,
if
he
would
have
done
it
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it
too
but
to
this
day,
nobody
has
made
that
finding
except
that
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
strongly
suggested
that
it
was
totally
involuntary
and
that
it
was
taken
and
if
we
took
the
uncontradicted
testimony
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
and
should
have
been
excluded
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
the
consequence
is
that
it’s
now
here
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
the
consequence
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
if
had
not
come
here
and
if
the
state
have
not
applied
for
cert,
it
would
have
gone
back
for
another
hearing
to
determine
the
voluntariness
of
the
statement
and
i
presume
that
some
other
judge
realizing
that
he
had
to
conform
with
jackson
versus
denno
and
the
sims
case
would
have
said
“i
have
heard
this
evidence,
i
find
it
to
be
voluntary”
and
that
would
have
been
it.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
to
another
state
court.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i
don’t
know
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
judge.
now
i
think
that
we
can
look
at
this
record
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
only
in
voluntary.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
we
get
a
new
trial
and
they
try
it
with
whatever
evidence
they
have
independent
of
the
confession.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it
was
indicted
in
about
november
of
1954
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
see
that
the
riot,
it
was
a
penitentiary
riot
in
september
of
1954
and
he
was
the
--
it
was
first
in
information
issued
against
them
and
then
they
indicted
him.
now
it
is
our
contention
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it
got
back
to
him
because
the
supreme
court
found,
the
missouri
supreme
court
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
should
have
a
hearing
on
the
post
--
on
the
2726
motion
which
is
our
post
conviction
device
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
confession
was
voluntary
together
with
some
other
matters.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
he
did
not.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
would
have
been
satisfied.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
it
was
judge
webber.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
in
effect
he
says
“i
cannot
that’s
res
judicata
problem”
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
what
it
is.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
except
your
honor
that
i
can’t
recall
the
case
but
i
understand
that
one
of
the
cases
indicate
that
another
as
judge
cannot
read
a
record
and
determine
the
demeanor
of
the
witness,
etcetera.
it
may
well
be
that
the
case
could
be
remanded
to
judge
godfrey
and
ask
judge
godfrey
to
correct
his
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i
don’t
think
that
would
conform
with
jackson
v.
doe,
because
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
who
has
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
has
the
atmosphere
of
the
case.
it
is
he
who
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
confession
is
voluntary.
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
do
it.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i’m
sorry?
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
he
is
and
believe
me
judge
webber
with
all
due
respect
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
no
i
don’t.
i
say
that
you
could
send
it
back
to
another
judge
who
can
hear
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
now.
just
as
i
say
judge
godfrey
could
have
done
it.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well
it
was
just
a
year
and
a
half,
two
years
ago
that
there
was
a
reasonably
full
hearing
after
18
years.
but
i
think
that
we
are
losing
sight
of
what
is
the
main
thrust
of
stidham’s
position
in
this
case
and
what
is
suggested
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
that
this
confession
should
have
been
thrown
out
completely.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
i
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
i
said
that
is
not
sufficient.
no,
i
don’t
and
really
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
that
we
have
got
to
realize
that
mr.
stidham
has
his
characterized
in
this
and
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
is
a
litigious
convict
and
again
that
litigiousness
is
it
was
a
by-product
of
innocence
perhaps.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
he
is
a
litigious,
i
make
no
bones
about
that
and
when
i
was
first
appointed
to
defend
this
man.
the
first
thing
that
he
asked
me
was
to
file
a
motion
for
a
lie
detector
test.
he
has
maintained
his
innocence
from
the
very
beginning,
that
was
18
years
ago,
he
has
asked
for
every
kind
of
relief.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
i
tried
the
case
in
the
first
instance
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
i
was
appointed
by
the
court
and
i
tried
the
case
18
years
ago
and
i
have
been
with
him
for
18
years.
now,
but
the
real
thrust
in
this
case
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
the
real
thrust
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
this
confession
was
in
fact
involuntary.
now,
let
us
--
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
i
certainly
think
that
it’s
a
proper
place
to
determine
it
for
once
and
for
all
as
to
whether
or
not
they
didn’t
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
beating
a
confession
out
of
this
defendant.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
well,
the
eighth
circuit
--
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
the
eighth
circuit
also
says
that
if
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case
is
true
that
that
confession
was
involuntary.
now
i
say
that
they
should
have
gone
further,
they
should

--
they
should
have
said
it
looks
like
it
is
involuntary,
they
should
have
said
as
a
matter
of
lie
is
involuntary
and
we
do
not
put
our
stamp
of
approval
on
it.
mr.

mr.
mark

yes,
now
with
respect
to
the
as
to
whether
or
not
--
even
if
this
court,
even
if
this
court
have
satisfied

v.
denno.
if
the
original
court
have
satisfied
jackson
v.
denno,
if
we
tried
this
court
yesterday
and
this
court
and
the
judge
who
tried
that
case
as
the
trial
of
the
facts,
if
he
have
found
that
the
confession
under
this
circumstances
was
in
fact
voluntary,
we
would
be
here
today
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
writ
of
habeas
corpus
asking
you
to
find
it
involuntary
for
the
following
reasons.
this
is
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case,
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case
when
taken
in
the
light
of
a
long
line
of
cases
which
this
court
has
already
ruled
on
brooks,
close
and
a
number
of
other
cases
as

mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
this
is
on
page
3
of
my
brief.
during
the
last
two
months
from
july
2,
1954
until
september
24,
stidham
was
confined
in
death
row
under
substantially
the
same
solitary
confinement
conditions
he
had
previously
undergone
with
the
exception
he
stated
that
on
death
row
he
was
not
provided
with
a
bunk
but
slept
on
a
straw
tick.
excuse
me.
i
am
sorry
if
the
court
would
turn
to
page
9,
i
apologize,
page
9,
the
bottom
of
page
9.
prior
to
giving
a
statement,
stidham
had
been
confined
in
solitary
confinement
for
20
months.
this
is
the
undisputed
testimony
to
the
solitary
confinement
had
for
the
most
part
been
on
a
cell
measuring
5
feet
x
7
feet
with
furnishings
consisting
of
a
wash
basin,
toilet,
steel
bunk
and
straw
tick
and
an
area
infested
with
cockroaches
and
rodents
and
with
ventilation
so
poor
that
stidham
passed
out
on
several
occasions.
and
i
might
tell
the
court
that
in
the
original
trial
he
told
the
court
that
the
conditions
in
that
penitentiary
were
so
bad
that
the
fbi
had
come
to
investigate
it
and
at
the
time
that
we
tried
the
post
conviction
motion
in
front
of
judge
godfrey
he
said
it
again,
and
during
all
of
that
time
there
has
been
no
attempt
made
to
contradict
that
testimony.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
on
jackson
v.
denno.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
no,
i
don’t
your
honor
but
i
have
this
poor
guy
for
18
years,
so
i
naturally
--
i
maybe
a
little
bit
prejudice
but
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
will
tell
you.
the
distinguished
judge
gibson
who
is
a
fine
judge
and
who
made
mention
of
the
fact
of
that
the
courts
are
loaded
down
just
as
mr.
romines
made
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
courts
are
loaded
down.
i
will
tell
you
with
--
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
if
all
we
do
is
go
back
to
a
trial
court
and
have
judge
godfrey
or
some
other
judge
listen
to
this
testimony
and
make
the
finding
that
this
confession
was
given
voluntarily,
then
i
tell
you
that
your
courts
will
be
burdened
again
because
we
will
take
it
again
through
a
whole
series
of
steps
because
of
the
fact
that
this
particular
findings
and
the
way
this
man
was
treated
so
shocks
the
conscience
of
anybody
who
wants
to
give
a
man
a
fair
trial
that
will
be
back
up
here
again
in
a
couple
of
years
with
it
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
best
way
to
do
it
is
to
make
that
determination
today
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
facts
on
this
case
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
whether
or
not
this
confession
was
involuntary.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
m.
hennelly
thank
you.
