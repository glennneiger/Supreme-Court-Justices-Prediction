stewart
you
mean
it’s
no
longer
theirs?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
this
was
a
possession
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
we
see
--
there
are
many
cases
like
that
here.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
because
of
the
protection
given
to
his
home.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
adversely
true
if
a
--
something
in
a
waste
basket
inside
of
his
living
room,
he
might
have
abandon
it,
conditionally
at
least,
but
the
reason
that’s
protected
is
because
his
home
is
protected,
does
that
connect
with
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
no
longer
abel’s
home,
because
he
had
given
up
the
room.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
somebody’s
property,
i
suppose,
is
protected
even
in
such
--
in
another
person’s
home,
isn’t
that
right
on
the
fourth
amendment,
if
i
lend
you
a
chattel
--
have
i
got
standing
to
object
to
an
unlawful
search
of
your
home
or
that
chattel
is
seized?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
my
property,
it’s
my
--
those
are
my
effects
that
had
been
unlawfully
searched
for
and
seized.
let’s
say
i
lend
you
some
guns?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you’ve
read
to
us
or
you
have
quoted
to
us
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
it
talks
about
a
person’s
effects
and
i
might
--
among
my
effects,
i
own
three
shotguns
and
i
lend
them
to
you
to
go
hunting.
and
they’re
in
your
house
and
there’s
an
unlawful
search
of
your
house
and
an
unlawful
seizure
of
those
guns,
do
i
have
a
standing
to
object
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
isn’t
an
invasion
of
my
privacy.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
seizure
of
my
effects
in
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
and
that’s
covered
by
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
also,
i
suppose,
just
to
the
factual
inference,
it
might
be
more
conditionally
abandoned.
sometimes
people
put
things
in
the
waste
basket
and
while
they’re
still
close
to
them,
they
decide
to
get
them
back
out,
yesterday’s
paper
for
example.
and
say,
well
we
put
that
in
the
garbage
can
or
i
want
to
see
an
article
in
it,
let’s
go
out
and
get
it.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
if
it’s
put
far
from
the
house,
it’s
unconditional.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
the
theory
was
only
that
it
was
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
fact
that
they
did
have
possession.
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
they
still
possessed
it
when
it
was
in
the
garbage
can.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it’s
--
if
the
opinion
of
supreme
court
of
california
rests
on
a
state
law
ground,
we
wouldn’t
affirm
it,
would
we?
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
my
business?
justice
potter
stewart
we
wouldn’t
affirm
it,
we
wouldn’t
reverse
it,
that’s
matter
for
the
state.

--
you
cite
the
jankovic
case
--
justice

--
in
your

we
dismissed
it,
didn’t
we?
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
the
whole
fourth
amendment,
its
applicability,
depends
inevitably
upon
sometimes
very
subtle
nuisances
and
differentiation
of

it?
