mr.
russell
iungerich
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
after
the
affirmance
of
the
trial
court
judgment
dismissing
a
criminal
case
after
a
motion
to
suppress
had
been
granted
in
california
trial’s
court
--
california
trial
court.
it
was
a
people’s
appeal.
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly
rose
in
this
manner.
an
anonymous
female
informant
placed
a
telephone
call
to
a
los
angeles
police
officer
and
informed
him
that
two
persons,
named
roger
and
judy
were
living
at
1901
nolden
in
los
angeles
and
were
engaged
in
narcotics
activities
and
were
also
injecting
methedrine
into
two
children
living
at
that
residence.
the
officers
verified
that
a
lady
named
judy
krivda
was
paying
the
utilities
at
that
address.
by
visual
observation
and
going
to
that
location,
they
saw
two
young
children
playing
in
the
front
yard.
they
returned
at
a
later
date,
approximately
a
week
later,
and
observed
several
trash
barrels
next
to
the
curb
on
the
parkway
awaiting
pick-up
by
trash
collectors.
they
also
observed
trash
collectors
in
the
vicinity
with
a
trash
collection
truck.
they
intercepted
the
trash
collectors
and
requested
that
the
trash
collectors
empty
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
and
deposit
these
particular
barrels
into
the
well
of
the
trash
trucks,
so
that
they
would
not
be
conglomerated
with
the
other
trash
collected
from
the
neighbors
in
that
vicinity.
then,
a
block
away
from
the
residence
where
the
respondents,
krivda
and
minor,
were
residing,
the
police
examined
the
contents
of
these
trash
barrels
within
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
and
in
the
contents
of
the
trash
barrels,
they
discovered
four
to
six
partially
smoked
marijuana
cigarettes
and
other
miscellaneous
contraband
narcotic
material.
after
this,
the
officers
observed,
respondent
roger
minor
come
from
the
house
and
retrieved
the
trash
barrels
and
placed
them
on
the
front
porch
of
the
house.
at
this
point,
the
officers
went
to
the
house;
they
arrested
respondent
minor,
affected
entry,
conducted
a
further
search,
and
ultimately
arrested
respondent
judith
krivda.
in
this
context
then,
two
important
questions
arising
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
presented
here.
the
first
is
whether
fourth
amendment
protection
extends
to
garbage
in
this
case,
which
has
been
placed
on
a
curb
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
appears
to
have
been
abandoned
to
the
trash
collector.
and
secondly,
whether
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
constitutionally
compelled.
with
respect
to
the
first
issue,
petitioners
submit
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court’s
precedents
set
in
the
cases
of
hester
versus
united
states
and
abel
versus
united
states.
in
the
latter
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
that
there
is
nothing
unlawful
in
the
government’s
appropriation
of
abandoned
property.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
it
is
clear
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
this
property
was
abandoned
and
that
the
respondents
herein
retained
no
further
privacy
interest
protected
by
the
fourth
or
fourteenth
amendment.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
is
clear
that
they
were
acts
of
abandonment,
first
by
placing
the
trash
into
the
trash
containers,
and
secondly,
those
--
the
abandonment
of
the
trash
was
further
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
barrels
were
placed
upon
the
curb
for
collection
by
the
trash
collector.
and
finally,
i
think
we
can
draw
a
further
inference
of
an
intent
to
abandon
by
the
fact
that
the
residents
of
the
house
did
not
attempt
to
intercept
these
trash
barrels
when
the
trashmen
came
to
collect
them
or
in
any
manner
attempt
to
retrieve
them
when
apparently
they
were
within
the
house,
since
roger
minor
was
later
seen
to
emerge
from
the
house
and
retrieve
the
trash
barrels.
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
privacy
was
at
in
end
that
the
constitution
protects
through
the
fourth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
the
fourth
is
applied
to
the
states.
basically,
the
fundamental
proposition
that
a
man’s
home
is
his
castle
and
the
things
around
his
house
are
protected
or
when
we
extend
privacy
beyond
these
fundamental
principles,
these
fundamental
areas,
we
get
into
a
very
tenuous
area,
where
we
don’t
have
a
privacy
interest,
we
don’t
have
annexes
that
connects
the
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
individual
with
the
property
seized
or
the
place
that
is
ultimately
searched
or
the
material
that
is
ultimately
examined.
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
speaks
in
the
possessive
that
persons
have
the
right
to
be
secured
in
their
houses,
papers,
and
effects
that
speaks
of
their
papers
and
effects
and
that
their
portion
of
the
amendment
ceases,
when
property
is
abandoned.
mr.
russell
iungerich
it’s
no
longer
theirs.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
the
question
of
possession
--
i
think
that
was
raised
in
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
a
footnote
in
california
versus
krivda,
but,
i
think
that
if
we
analyze,
we
are
dealing
with
two
separate
matters
here
as
to
whether
there’s
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
and
whether
there
is
probable
cause
for
arrest.
and
i
would
present
this
example
to
the
court,
the
example
of
a
man
who
sees
a
police
officer
approaching
and
at
that
point
he
throws
a
bin
with
heroine
on
the
ground.
the
courts
have
said
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
that
the
bin
with
heroin
--
yes.
the
bin
with
heroin
is
abandoned,
but
no
court
has
ever
held
that
the
fact
that
the
man
had
possessed
it
recently,
had
possessed
it
prior
to
the
abandonment
that
that
could
not
be
used
as
circumstantial
evidence
to
subsequently
convict
him
of
having
had
dominion
and
control
at
the
prior
point
in
time,
and
i
think
that
those
two
fundamental
questions
need
to
be
separated.
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court’s
opinion,
where
the
footnote
suggests
that
possibly
there
would
not
be
sufficient
dominion
and
control
is
inadvertent
and
those
facts
were
not
before
the
court,
and
i
think
that
it
is
improvident
that
that
statement
was
made
in
the
opinion.
but,
i
think
that
the
two
questions
are
wholly
separate.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
police
officers
had
the
right
to
examine
this
property
in
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
and
certainly
these
particular
respondents
had
no
fundamental
right
of
privacy
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
location,
one
block
away
from
their
home,
inside
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
or
with
respect
to
the
matters
that
weren’t
--
the
materials
that
was
examined,
which
had
been
abandoned
by
them.
and,
i
think
there’s
no
question
that
they
voluntarily
relinquished
all
further
rights
or
interest
in
that
property.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
that
the
case
might
be
fundamentally
different
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
there
may
be
a
protection
with
the
areas
immediately
around
the
house
for
the
protection
of
the
--
these
contents.
in
other
words,
they
might
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
it
would
be
possibly
and
i
think
that
it
would
show
an
abandonment,
but
i
think
that
there
we
would
have
a
conflicting
situation.
in
other
words
that
it
may
--
the
contents
of
the
trash
barrel
at
that
point,
may
have
even
though
they’re
abandoned,
may
somehow
be
protected,
because
the
trash
barrel
at
that
point
is
owned
by
the
individual
and
it
is
within
his
backyard
for
example,
as
it
was
in
edwards.
i
think
that
there
may
be
some
--
that’s
not
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
russell
iungerich
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
russell
iungerich
under
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
that
would
be
the
way
i
would
distinguish
the
case,
yes
your
honor.
that
would
be,
of
course,
different
from
the
situation
in
abel,
where
the
man
had
vacated
a
hotel
room
and
the
contents
were
found
in
the
waste
paper
basket.
there
of
course,
there
would
be
abandonment.
mr.
russell
iungerich
that’s
--
that
is
a
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
not
under
the
alderman
decision
of
this
court,
i
don’t
believe
your
honor.
i
don’t
believe
you
would
have
standing.
i
think
under
california,
under
people’s
versus
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
but,
i
think
there
would
be
a
question
there
as
to
whether
you
could
raise
an
objection
at
that
point
to
the
unlawful
seizure.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
i
think
probably,
the
crucial
distinction
there
would
be
that
the
--
there
would
nothing
to
indicate
the
fact
of
possession
to
the
officer
where
they’re
located
in
a
different
location.
i
don’t
know
whether
you
would
have
a
right
of
privacy
there.
i
could
see
a
right
of
privacy,
perhaps
where
you
deposited
your
chattel
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
would
not
think
so
your
honor,
because
i
think
there
again
we’ve
got
a
--
we
have
a
question
of
a
--
you
have
--
actually
under
those
circumstances
i
think
it
would
be
the
question
of
have
you
assumed
the
risk
that
possibly
there
would
be
an
invasion
of
your
privacy,
where
you
would
not
be
there
to
assert
your
own
personal
rights.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
it’s
an
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
but
i
think
--
i
don’t
think
that
that
--
that
the
coverage
of
your
effects
in
that
sense,
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
closer
--
first,
i
think
there’s
--
it’s
important
to
look
in
terms
of
the
--
further
of
being
secure
in
those
effects,
i
think
somehow
your
personal
connection
with
the
effects
has
to
be
manifest
at
the
point
to
someone
outside
that
they
are
your
effects
or
that
they’re
likely
to
be
the
effects
of
someone
other
than
the
person
who
is
in
that
particular
dwelling
and
holding
those
particular
chattels.
now,
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances,
a
police
officer,
for
example,
would
not
be
able
to
discern
that
they
were
your
effects
from
the
fact
that
you
have
lend
them
someone
else,
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
that
he
would
be
judging
in
--
on
the
basis
of
the
reasonable
probabilities
involved
that
they
belong
to
the
person
in
the
house
and
not
to
you.
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
--
i
think
that
we
might
make
an
exception
from
the
language
of
the
--
as
it
stated
in
the
amendment.
i
don’t
know
there’s
an
exception,
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
applied
to
that
situation.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
reasonable
assumption
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
russell
iungerich
because
i
think
that
when
a
man
abandons
property
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
believe
the
police
are
in
the
garbage
business,
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
the
question
has
to
be,
does
the
man
--
has
the
man
exposed,
as
we
speak
of
him
as
this
court
has
spoken
of
him
in
katz,
where
he
has
exposed
this
particular
material
to
the
public,
his
privacy
interest
are
in
an
end.
in
other
words
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
believe
the
can
was
in
this
case
were
originally
covered.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor,
because
it’s
well-known
that
the
garbage
man
himself
is
going
to
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
actually
empty
those
cans
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
possibly
observe
the
contents.
mr.
russell
iungerich
it
occurred
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
have
the
statistics
and
i
was
unable
to
locate
any
statistics
on
the
number
of
times
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
question
of
whether
you
can
assume
if
the
police
would
not
look
into
your
garbage,
because
i
think
you
could
also
assume
that
there’s
a
likelihood
that
the
police
would
not
search
your
house
with
or
without
a
warrant.
there
is
also
a
strong
possibility
that
the
police
would
not
arrest
you.
but,
i
don’t
think
that
that
necessarily
shows
that
you
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
the
circumstances
are
under
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
what
that
proposition
ultimately
leads
to
is
that
we
create
a
constitutional
sanctuary
for
the
disposal
of
evidence.
in
other
words,
if
a
man,
for
example,
in
changing
the
facts
of
our
case
at
this
point,
but
assume
the
police
had
not
received
the
telephone
call
that
they
did,
but
it
rather
received
an
anonymous
--
a
phone
call
from
an
anonymous
informant
who
said
that
the
man
who
lived
inside
his
house
had
murdered
his
wife.
and
that
they
were
unable
to
verify
that,
but
they
did
see
the
trashcans.
and
assumes
further
that
this
man
had
dismembered
his
wife
and
put
her
--
and
the
portions
of
her
body
in
brown
butcher
paper
inside
a
can,
the
police
would
then
--
would
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
if
they
attempted
to
look
at
the
contents
in
the
well
of
the
trash
truck,
would
actually
be
barred
by
a
constitutional
rule
to
the
contrary,
to
the
position
the
petitioner
takes
in
this
case.
they
would
be
barred
from
ever
reaching
that
evidence
and
this
man
would
be
given
a
sanctuary
for
the
disposal
of
this
type
of
evidence
and
actually
for
the
disposal
of
the
body.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
--
i
don’t
think
that
there
--
that
most
--
well,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
that
the
police
did
not
look
in
the
can
because
they
felt
that
perhaps
if
they
were
aware
of
the
edwards
decision
that
that
might
violate
--
well,
that
--
why
did
it
--
they
wanted
to
get
it
as
far
removed
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
that
--
there
is
the
possibility
that
if
it
were
still
on
the
curb,
there
might
be
a
chance
of
it
being
within
the
curtilage.
and,
i
think
it’d
be
on
the
safe
side
that
the
officers
have
the
cans,
you
know,
had
requested
in
this
case
that
the
cans
be
placed
within
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
where
it
was
a
clear
situation.
and
i
think
the
only
thing
i
can
say
in
this
case
that
they
could
account
for
that
is
that
it
was
good
police
work
rather
than
bad
police
work,
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
the
officers
tried
as
best
they
could
to
have
the
minimum
possible
intrusion.
and
i
don’t
think
that
one
--
a
man
expects
to
have
a
right
of
privacy
in
his
garbage
as
a
general
rule.
he
most
--
i
would
think
if
you
ask
the
general
man
on
the
street,
actually
where
his
garbage
came
to
rest,
he
would
probably
tell
you
that
he
didn’t
even
care.
and,
i
don’t
think
that
most
of
us
are
concerned
about
the
disposition
that
takes
place
after,
that
we
are
concerned
about
privacy.
i
think
the
question
also
as
i
pointed
out,
major
credit
card
companies
advised
their
cardholders
to
cover
--
to
cut
the
cards
and
to
actually
destroy
the
cards
and
mutilate
them
before
they
go
into
the
garbage
can.
and
i
think
that
proceeds
on
the
inference
that
the
public
doesn’t
expect
privacy.
that
the
public
expects,
today,
at
colleges,
for
example,
to
comb
over
garbage,
to
find
whether
there’s
recycled
material,
they
expect
the
possibility
of
dogs
or
cats
or
nosy
neighbors
to
look
inside
their
trashcans
and
possibly
scavengers
on
the
street.
and
i
think
under
these
circumstances,
while
there
maybe
a
subjective
expectation
upon
--
among
some
people
that
there
is
a
privacy
interest
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
a
reasonable
expectation
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
man
had
parted
with
control
over
this
particular
item
of
property.
he
has
abandoned
it,
and
he
has
done,
what
is
the
classic
definition
of
abandonment,
he
has
thrown
it
away.
i
think
that
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
a
man’s
home
is
his
castle.
it’s
another
thing
to
say
that
the
garbage
dump
is
his
castle.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
believe
it’s
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case.
i
am
familiar
with
the
rules
in
los
angeles,
as
far
as
setback
regulations
in
the
county
--
or
the
city
in
this
case
would
have
--
would
own
that
property
or
have
an
easement
upon
the
property
out
in
front,
on
the
parkway.
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
however,
we
are
removed
even
from
the
point
of
which
the
garbage
was
out
at
that
point
on
the
parkway,
because
the
ultimate
examination
which
took
place,
took
place
in
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
a
block
away
from
the
location.
so
i
think
at
that
point,
there’s
no
question,
if
there
was
any
element
of
the
curtilage
involved
here
or
protection
of
the
area
of
the
domestic
economy
around
the
house.
i
think
however,
there’s
still
no
question
if
the
property
was
abandoned,
if
the
police
officers
did
look
into
the
trashcans
at
that
point
and
did
retrieve
something
from
the
trashcans.
that
property
was
abandoned
property
and
under
the
holding
in
the
able
case
it
would
--
if
it
is
abandoned
it
would
not
--
would
be
reasonable
to
appropriate
it
that
these
officers
did
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
am
saying
that
--
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that.
if
we
assume
that
the
--
that
that
is
government
land
in
the
front,
in
other
words
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
i
think
i’ve
made
a
slip
of
a
tongue
here,
when
i
said
that
it
was
--
it
is
abandoned
at
the
point
it’s
on
the
back
porch,
and
that
is
my
position,
but
there
maybe
some
protection
from
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
area
around
the
house
or
connected
with
the
house
at
that
point.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
would
think
so,
i
think
that
would
distinguish
the
ward
case
from
this
case,
where
there
was
an
inference,
possible
inference
of
hiding
something
in
a
can,
which
differentiated
in.
i
think
that
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
your
honor,
i
could
do
that
now.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
this
question
i
think
is
fairly
clear
from
the
--
this
goes
to
the
argument
that
the
respondent
has
made
--
the
certiorari
has
been
improvidently
granted,
as
i
would
understand
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
is
that
the
question?
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
it’s
clear
from
the
opinion
that
they
--
that
the
california
supreme
court
rested
its
decision
on
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
not
upon
any
separate
ground.
you
find
no
mention
of
either
article
i,
section
19
of
the
california
constitution,
which
is
the
search
and
seizure
analog
in
the
california
constitution
or
to
the
kahan
rule.
and,
i
think
the
case
is
just
clearly
set
forth
on
the
--
from
the
language
of
mr.
justice
burke
that
he
relied
upon
the
edwards
and
bradley
decisions
which
maybe
ambiguous.
but,
he
said
he
relied
on
them
only
to
the
extent
that
they
rely
upon
like
principles
in
katz
versus
united
states.
and,
i
think
there
is
no
question
from
that
that
he
was
relying
on
federal
and
not
state
law.
so
therefore
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
it
was
a
--
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
russell
iungerich
the
motion
to
suppress
is
--
the
argument
on
the
motion
to
suppress
is
not
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
it
was
a
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
and,
it
was
made
on
the
ground
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
--
there
were
actually
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
under
the
fourth
amendment,
i
believe.
i
haven’t
got
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
your
honor,
the
question
is
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
--
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
what
your
honor,
what
the
opinions
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
white,
have
indicated
this
court
looks
out.
this
court
has
indicated
that
it
looks
to
line
--
to
the
decision
of
the
court
itself
and
examines.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
there
was
no
transcript
at
the
proceedings
lodged,
as
far
as
i
know
with
this
court.
there
is
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
necessarily
they
would.
i
have
heard
many
motions
to
suppress
them
in
some
california
court,
and
i
don’t
think
i’ve
ever
heard
one
that
specifically
was
argued
on
the
basis
of
the
california
constitution.
the
reason
for
that
is
our
exclusionary
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
think
there
has
ever
been
a
california
case
that’s
decided
expressly
that
the
case
is
determined
under
the
california
constitutional
article
on
searches
and
seizures.
i
think
that
if
you
examine
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
it’s
identical
with
the
federal
one,
your
honor,
but
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
case
that
said
that
specifically,
the
question
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
california
could
well
predicate
it
further
on
state
grounds,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
ground
for
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
under
the
circumstances,
we
would
have
a
clear
ruling
that
it
was
not
required
under
the
federal
constitution.
i
think
that
that’s
same
situation
was
involved
in
california
versus
byers,
which
this
court
reviewed,
which
dealt
with
a
federal
constitutional
question
dealing
with
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
the
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
no,
they
did
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
they
predicated
--
the
rule
was
stated
as
a
judicially
declared
rule
of
evidence
that
was
not
constitutionally
compelled.
and
in
specific
language
of
mr.
justice
friendly
in
that
opinion
said
that
absent
any
compulsion
from
the
federal
constitution
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
well
most
recently
in
the
caplan
decision
in
6th
cal
3rd,
the
california
court
expressly
relied,
expressly
stated
and
there’s
a
clear
footnote
in
that
opinion,
which
states
that
they
do
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
that
standing
rules
required
under
article
1,
section
19
of
the
california
constitution,
they
avoided
the
question
entirely.
i
don’t
think
the
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
they
predicate
it
on
the
fact
that
they
were
relying
on
the
--
that
this
rule
had
continued,
since
the
kahan
days.
and
that
they
did
not
feel
that
since
it
had
been
an
established
practice
in
california
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
that
it
should
be
overturned.
and,
i
think
they
distinguished
in
the
opinion,
the
question
of
standing
from
a
question
of
fourth
amendment
protection.
mr.
russell
iungerich
it
has
a
one
liner
difference,
they’re
virtually
identical.
the
difference
is
that
seizure
and
search
rather
than
search
and
seizure.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
am
familiar
with
the
case;
i
am
not
familiar
with
all
the
facts
in
the
record
in
that
matter
your
honor.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
clear
from
the
california
decisions.
mr.
russell
iungerich
in
this
case
and
under
the
search
and
seizure
question.
and
secondly,
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
i
certain
can,
your
honor,
possibly
be
the
end
of
the
week,
since
it
would
be
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
it
did.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
it
most
certainly
is,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
most
clearly
come
forward
and
state
that
they
are
relying
on
that
and
as
the
anderson
case
strike
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
we
don’t
have
that
ambiguity
in
this
case.
i
think
we
must
be
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
referring
mr.
justice
brennan
to
the
kirchner
opinion,
but
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
but
i
don’t
think
we
have
that
same
situation
in
this
case,
because
there
isn’t
any
ambiguity
in
this
opinion.
and,
i
think
the
case
is
that
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
the
difference
here
is
that
the
california
--
mr.
justice
burke
expressly
states
in
this
opinion
that
he’s
relying
on
california
law
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
compelled
by
katz
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and,
as
clearly
indicated
in
--
they
could
indicate
some
possible
reference.
in
the
other
decisions,
they
did
mention
in
their
prior
decisions
and
garbage
collection
cases,
the
edwards
decision
and
the
bradley
decision,
they
indicated
that
the
case
did
have
some
emanations
from
the
california
constitution
whereas,
in
this
case,
there
were
none.
mr.
russell
iungerich
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
after
the
affirmance
of
the
trial
court
judgment
dismissing
a
criminal
case
after
a
motion
to
suppress
had
been
granted
in
california
trial’s
court
--
california
trial
court.
it
was
a
people’s
appeal.
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly
rose
in
this
manner.
an
anonymous
female
informant
placed
a
telephone
call
to
a
los
angeles
police
officer
and
informed
him
that
two
persons,
named
roger
and
judy
were
living
at
1901
nolden
in
los
angeles
and
were
engaged
in
narcotics
activities
and
were
also
injecting
methedrine
into
two
children
living
at
that
residence.
the
officers
verified
that
a
lady
named
judy
krivda
was
paying
the
utilities
at
that
address.
by
visual
observation
and
going
to
that
location,
they
saw
two
young
children
playing
in
the
front
yard.
they
returned
at
a
later
date,
approximately
a
week
later,
and
observed
several
trash
barrels
next
to
the
curb
on
the
parkway
awaiting
pick-up
by
trash
collectors.
they
also
observed
trash
collectors
in
the
vicinity
with
a
trash
collection
truck.
they
intercepted
the
trash
collectors
and
requested
that
the
trash
collectors
empty
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
and
deposit
these
particular
barrels
into
the
well
of
the
trash
trucks,
so
that
they
would
not
be
conglomerated
with
the
other
trash
collected
from
the
neighbors
in
that
vicinity.
then,
a
block
away
from
the
residence
where
the
respondents,
krivda
and
minor,
were
residing,
the
police
examined
the
contents
of
these
trash
barrels
within
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
and
in
the
contents
of
the
trash
barrels,
they
discovered
four
to
six
partially
smoked
marijuana
cigarettes
and
other
miscellaneous
contraband
narcotic
material.
after
this,
the
officers
observed,
respondent
roger
minor
come
from
the
house
and
retrieved
the
trash
barrels
and
placed
them
on
the
front
porch
of
the
house.
at
this
point,
the
officers
went
to
the
house;
they
arrested
respondent
minor,
affected
entry,
conducted
a
further
search,
and
ultimately
arrested
respondent
judith
krivda.
in
this
context
then,
two
important
questions
arising
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
presented
here.
the
first
is
whether
fourth
amendment
protection
extends
to
garbage
in
this
case,
which
has
been
placed
on
a
curb
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
appears
to
have
been
abandoned
to
the
trash
collector.
and
secondly,
whether
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
constitutionally
compelled.
with
respect
to
the
first
issue,
petitioners
submit
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court’s
precedents
set
in
the
cases
of
hester
versus
united
states
and
abel
versus
united
states.
in
the
latter
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
that
there
is
nothing
unlawful
in
the
government’s
appropriation
of
abandoned
property.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
it
is
clear
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
this
property
was
abandoned
and
that
the
respondents
herein
retained
no
further
privacy
interest
protected
by
the
fourth
or
fourteenth
amendment.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
is
clear
that
they
were
acts
of
abandonment,
first
by
placing
the
trash
into
the
trash
containers,
and
secondly,
those
--
the
abandonment
of
the
trash
was
further
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
barrels
were
placed
upon
the
curb
for
collection
by
the
trash
collector.
and
finally,
i
think
we
can
draw
a
further
inference
of
an
intent
to
abandon
by
the
fact
that
the
residents
of
the
house
did
not
attempt
to
intercept
these
trash
barrels
when
the
trashmen
came
to
collect
them
or
in
any
manner
attempt
to
retrieve
them
when
apparently
they
were
within
the
house,
since
roger
minor
was
later
seen
to
emerge
from
the
house
and
retrieve
the
trash
barrels.
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
privacy
was
at
in
end
that
the
constitution
protects
through
the
fourth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
the
fourth
is
applied
to
the
states.
basically,
the
fundamental
proposition
that
a
man’s
home
is
his
castle
and
the
things
around
his
house
are
protected
or
when
we
extend
privacy
beyond
these
fundamental
principles,
these
fundamental
areas,
we
get
into
a
very
tenuous
area,
where
we
don’t
have
a
privacy
interest,
we
don’t
have
annexes
that
connects
the
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
individual
with
the
property
seized
or
the
place
that
is
ultimately
searched
or
the
material
that
is
ultimately
examined.
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
speaks
in
the
possessive
that
persons
have
the
right
to
be
secured
in
their
houses,
papers,
and
effects
that
speaks
of
their
papers
and
effects
and
that
their
portion
of
the
amendment
ceases,
when
property
is
abandoned.
mr.
russell
iungerich
it’s
no
longer
theirs.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
the
question
of
possession
--
i
think
that
was
raised
in
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
a
footnote
in
california
versus
krivda,
but,
i
think
that
if
we
analyze,
we
are
dealing
with
two
separate
matters
here
as
to
whether
there’s
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
and
whether
there
is
probable
cause
for
arrest.
and
i
would
present
this
example
to
the
court,
the
example
of
a
man
who
sees
a
police
officer
approaching
and
at
that
point
he
throws
a
bin
with
heroine
on
the
ground.
the
courts
have
said
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
that
the
bin
with
heroin
--
yes.
the
bin
with
heroin
is
abandoned,
but
no
court
has
ever
held
that
the
fact
that
the
man
had
possessed
it
recently,
had
possessed
it
prior
to
the
abandonment
that
that
could
not
be
used
as
circumstantial
evidence
to
subsequently
convict
him
of
having
had
dominion
and
control
at
the
prior
point
in
time,
and
i
think
that
those
two
fundamental
questions
need
to
be
separated.
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court’s
opinion,
where
the
footnote
suggests
that
possibly
there
would
not
be
sufficient
dominion
and
control
is
inadvertent
and
those
facts
were
not
before
the
court,
and
i
think
that
it
is
improvident
that
that
statement
was
made
in
the
opinion.
but,
i
think
that
the
two
questions
are
wholly
separate.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
police
officers
had
the
right
to
examine
this
property
in
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
and
certainly
these
particular
respondents
had
no
fundamental
right
of
privacy
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
location,
one
block
away
from
their
home,
inside
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
or
with
respect
to
the
matters
that
weren’t
--
the
materials
that
was
examined,
which
had
been
abandoned
by
them.
and,
i
think
there’s
no
question
that
they
voluntarily
relinquished
all
further
rights
or
interest
in
that
property.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
that
the
case
might
be
fundamentally
different
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
there
may
be
a
protection
with
the
areas
immediately
around
the
house
for
the
protection
of
the
--
these
contents.
in
other
words,
they
might
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
it
would
be
possibly
and
i
think
that
it
would
show
an
abandonment,
but
i
think
that
there
we
would
have
a
conflicting
situation.
in
other
words
that
it
may
--
the
contents
of
the
trash
barrel
at
that
point,
may
have
even
though
they’re
abandoned,
may
somehow
be
protected,
because
the
trash
barrel
at
that
point
is
owned
by
the
individual
and
it
is
within
his
backyard
for
example,
as
it
was
in
edwards.
i
think
that
there
may
be
some
--
that’s
not
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
russell
iungerich
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
russell
iungerich
under
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
that
would
be
the
way
i
would
distinguish
the
case,
yes
your
honor.
that
would
be,
of
course,
different
from
the
situation
in
abel,
where
the
man
had
vacated
a
hotel
room
and
the
contents
were
found
in
the
waste
paper
basket.
there
of
course,
there
would
be
abandonment.
mr.
russell
iungerich
that’s
--
that
is
a
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
not
under
the
alderman
decision
of
this
court,
i
don’t
believe
your
honor.
i
don’t
believe
you
would
have
standing.
i
think
under
california,
under
people’s
versus
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
but,
i
think
there
would
be
a
question
there
as
to
whether
you
could
raise
an
objection
at
that
point
to
the
unlawful
seizure.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
i
think
probably,
the
crucial
distinction
there
would
be
that
the
--
there
would
nothing
to
indicate
the
fact
of
possession
to
the
officer
where
they’re
located
in
a
different
location.
i
don’t
know
whether
you
would
have
a
right
of
privacy
there.
i
could
see
a
right
of
privacy,
perhaps
where
you
deposited
your
chattel
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
would
not
think
so
your
honor,
because
i
think
there
again
we’ve
got
a
--
we
have
a
question
of
a
--
you
have
--
actually
under
those
circumstances
i
think
it
would
be
the
question
of
have
you
assumed
the
risk
that
possibly
there
would
be
an
invasion
of
your
privacy,
where
you
would
not
be
there
to
assert
your
own
personal
rights.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
it’s
an
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
but
i
think
--
i
don’t
think
that
that
--
that
the
coverage
of
your
effects
in
that
sense,
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
closer
--
first,
i
think
there’s
--
it’s
important
to
look
in
terms
of
the
--
further
of
being
secure
in
those
effects,
i
think
somehow
your
personal
connection
with
the
effects
has
to
be
manifest
at
the
point
to
someone
outside
that
they
are
your
effects
or
that
they’re
likely
to
be
the
effects
of
someone
other
than
the
person
who
is
in
that
particular
dwelling
and
holding
those
particular
chattels.
now,
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances,
a
police
officer,
for
example,
would
not
be
able
to
discern
that
they
were
your
effects
from
the
fact
that
you
have
lend
them
someone
else,
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
that
he
would
be
judging
in
--
on
the
basis
of
the
reasonable
probabilities
involved
that
they
belong
to
the
person
in
the
house
and
not
to
you.
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
--
i
think
that
we
might
make
an
exception
from
the
language
of
the
--
as
it
stated
in
the
amendment.
i
don’t
know
there’s
an
exception,
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
applied
to
that
situation.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
reasonable
assumption
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
russell
iungerich
because
i
think
that
when
a
man
abandons
property
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
believe
the
police
are
in
the
garbage
business,
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
the
question
has
to
be,
does
the
man
--
has
the
man
exposed,
as
we
speak
of
him
as
this
court
has
spoken
of
him
in
katz,
where
he
has
exposed
this
particular
material
to
the
public,
his
privacy
interest
are
in
an
end.
in
other
words
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
believe
the
can
was
in
this
case
were
originally
covered.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor,
because
it’s
well-known
that
the
garbage
man
himself
is
going
to
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
actually
empty
those
cans
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
possibly
observe
the
contents.
mr.
russell
iungerich
it
occurred
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
have
the
statistics
and
i
was
unable
to
locate
any
statistics
on
the
number
of
times
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
question
of
whether
you
can
assume
if
the
police
would
not
look
into
your
garbage,
because
i
think
you
could
also
assume
that
there’s
a
likelihood
that
the
police
would
not
search
your
house
with
or
without
a
warrant.
there
is
also
a
strong
possibility
that
the
police
would
not
arrest
you.
but,
i
don’t
think
that
that
necessarily
shows
that
you
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
the
circumstances
are
under
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
what
that
proposition
ultimately
leads
to
is
that
we
create
a
constitutional
sanctuary
for
the
disposal
of
evidence.
in
other
words,
if
a
man,
for
example,
in
changing
the
facts
of
our
case
at
this
point,
but
assume
the
police
had
not
received
the
telephone
call
that
they
did,
but
it
rather
received
an
anonymous
--
a
phone
call
from
an
anonymous
informant
who
said
that
the
man
who
lived
inside
his
house
had
murdered
his
wife.
and
that
they
were
unable
to
verify
that,
but
they
did
see
the
trashcans.
and
assumes
further
that
this
man
had
dismembered
his
wife
and
put
her
--
and
the
portions
of
her
body
in
brown
butcher
paper
inside
a
can,
the
police
would
then
--
would
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
if
they
attempted
to
look
at
the
contents
in
the
well
of
the
trash
truck,
would
actually
be
barred
by
a
constitutional
rule
to
the
contrary,
to
the
position
the
petitioner
takes
in
this
case.
they
would
be
barred
from
ever
reaching
that
evidence
and
this
man
would
be
given
a
sanctuary
for
the
disposal
of
this
type
of
evidence
and
actually
for
the
disposal
of
the
body.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
--
i
don’t
think
that
there
--
that
most
--
well,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
that
the
police
did
not
look
in
the
can
because
they
felt
that
perhaps
if
they
were
aware
of
the
edwards
decision
that
that
might
violate
--
well,
that
--
why
did
it
--
they
wanted
to
get
it
as
far
removed
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
that
--
there
is
the
possibility
that
if
it
were
still
on
the
curb,
there
might
be
a
chance
of
it
being
within
the
curtilage.
and,
i
think
it’d
be
on
the
safe
side
that
the
officers
have
the
cans,
you
know,
had
requested
in
this
case
that
the
cans
be
placed
within
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
where
it
was
a
clear
situation.
and
i
think
the
only
thing
i
can
say
in
this
case
that
they
could
account
for
that
is
that
it
was
good
police
work
rather
than
bad
police
work,
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
the
officers
tried
as
best
they
could
to
have
the
minimum
possible
intrusion.
and
i
don’t
think
that
one
--
a
man
expects
to
have
a
right
of
privacy
in
his
garbage
as
a
general
rule.
he
most
--
i
would
think
if
you
ask
the
general
man
on
the
street,
actually
where
his
garbage
came
to
rest,
he
would
probably
tell
you
that
he
didn’t
even
care.
and,
i
don’t
think
that
most
of
us
are
concerned
about
the
disposition
that
takes
place
after,
that
we
are
concerned
about
privacy.
i
think
the
question
also
as
i
pointed
out,
major
credit
card
companies
advised
their
cardholders
to
cover
--
to
cut
the
cards
and
to
actually
destroy
the
cards
and
mutilate
them
before
they
go
into
the
garbage
can.
and
i
think
that
proceeds
on
the
inference
that
the
public
doesn’t
expect
privacy.
that
the
public
expects,
today,
at
colleges,
for
example,
to
comb
over
garbage,
to
find
whether
there’s
recycled
material,
they
expect
the
possibility
of
dogs
or
cats
or
nosy
neighbors
to
look
inside
their
trashcans
and
possibly
scavengers
on
the
street.
and
i
think
under
these
circumstances,
while
there
maybe
a
subjective
expectation
upon
--
among
some
people
that
there
is
a
privacy
interest
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
a
reasonable
expectation
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
man
had
parted
with
control
over
this
particular
item
of
property.
he
has
abandoned
it,
and
he
has
done,
what
is
the
classic
definition
of
abandonment,
he
has
thrown
it
away.
i
think
that
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
a
man’s
home
is
his
castle.
it’s
another
thing
to
say
that
the
garbage
dump
is
his
castle.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
believe
it’s
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case.
i
am
familiar
with
the
rules
in
los
angeles,
as
far
as
setback
regulations
in
the
county
--
or
the
city
in
this
case
would
have
--
would
own
that
property
or
have
an
easement
upon
the
property
out
in
front,
on
the
parkway.
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
however,
we
are
removed
even
from
the
point
of
which
the
garbage
was
out
at
that
point
on
the
parkway,
because
the
ultimate
examination
which
took
place,
took
place
in
the
well
of
the
trash
truck
a
block
away
from
the
location.
so
i
think
at
that
point,
there’s
no
question,
if
there
was
any
element
of
the
curtilage
involved
here
or
protection
of
the
area
of
the
domestic
economy
around
the
house.
i
think
however,
there’s
still
no
question
if
the
property
was
abandoned,
if
the
police
officers
did
look
into
the
trashcans
at
that
point
and
did
retrieve
something
from
the
trashcans.
that
property
was
abandoned
property
and
under
the
holding
in
the
able
case
it
would
--
if
it
is
abandoned
it
would
not
--
would
be
reasonable
to
appropriate
it
that
these
officers
did
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
am
saying
that
--
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that.
if
we
assume
that
the
--
that
that
is
government
land
in
the
front,
in
other
words
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
i
think
i’ve
made
a
slip
of
a
tongue
here,
when
i
said
that
it
was
--
it
is
abandoned
at
the
point
it’s
on
the
back
porch,
and
that
is
my
position,
but
there
maybe
some
protection
from
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
area
around
the
house
or
connected
with
the
house
at
that
point.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
would
think
so,
i
think
that
would
distinguish
the
ward
case
from
this
case,
where
there
was
an
inference,
possible
inference
of
hiding
something
in
a
can,
which
differentiated
in.
i
think
that
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
your
honor,
i
could
do
that
now.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
this
question
i
think
is
fairly
clear
from
the
--
this
goes
to
the
argument
that
the
respondent
has
made
--
the
certiorari
has
been
improvidently
granted,
as
i
would
understand
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
is
that
the
question?
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
it’s
clear
from
the
opinion
that
they
--
that
the
california
supreme
court
rested
its
decision
on
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
not
upon
any
separate
ground.
you
find
no
mention
of
either
article
i,
section
19
of
the
california
constitution,
which
is
the
search
and
seizure
analog
in
the
california
constitution
or
to
the
kahan
rule.
and,
i
think
the
case
is
just
clearly
set
forth
on
the
--
from
the
language
of
mr.
justice
burke
that
he
relied
upon
the
edwards
and
bradley
decisions
which
maybe
ambiguous.
but,
he
said
he
relied
on
them
only
to
the
extent
that
they
rely
upon
like
principles
in
katz
versus
united
states.
and,
i
think
there
is
no
question
from
that
that
he
was
relying
on
federal
and
not
state
law.
so
therefore
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
it
was
a
--
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
russell
iungerich
the
motion
to
suppress
is
--
the
argument
on
the
motion
to
suppress
is
not
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
it
was
a
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
and,
it
was
made
on
the
ground
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
--
there
were
actually
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
under
the
fourth
amendment,
i
believe.
i
haven’t
got
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
your
honor,
the
question
is
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
--
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
what
your
honor,
what
the
opinions
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
white,
have
indicated
this
court
looks
out.
this
court
has
indicated
that
it
looks
to
line
--
to
the
decision
of
the
court
itself
and
examines.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
there
was
no
transcript
at
the
proceedings
lodged,
as
far
as
i
know
with
this
court.
there
is
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
necessarily
they
would.
i
have
heard
many
motions
to
suppress
them
in
some
california
court,
and
i
don’t
think
i’ve
ever
heard
one
that
specifically
was
argued
on
the
basis
of
the
california
constitution.
the
reason
for
that
is
our
exclusionary
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
don’t
think
there
has
ever
been
a
california
case
that’s
decided
expressly
that
the
case
is
determined
under
the
california
constitutional
article
on
searches
and
seizures.
i
think
that
if
you
examine
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
it’s
identical
with
the
federal
one,
your
honor,
but
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
case
that
said
that
specifically,
the
question
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
california
could
well
predicate
it
further
on
state
grounds,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
ground
for
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
under
the
circumstances,
we
would
have
a
clear
ruling
that
it
was
not
required
under
the
federal
constitution.
i
think
that
that’s
same
situation
was
involved
in
california
versus
byers,
which
this
court
reviewed,
which
dealt
with
a
federal
constitutional
question
dealing
with
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
the
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
no,
they
did
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
they
predicated
--
the
rule
was
stated
as
a
judicially
declared
rule
of
evidence
that
was
not
constitutionally
compelled.
and
in
specific
language
of
mr.
justice
friendly
in
that
opinion
said
that
absent
any
compulsion
from
the
federal
constitution
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
well
most
recently
in
the
caplan
decision
in
6th
cal
3rd,
the
california
court
expressly
relied,
expressly
stated
and
there’s
a
clear
footnote
in
that
opinion,
which
states
that
they
do
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
that
standing
rules
required
under
article
1,
section
19
of
the
california
constitution,
they
avoided
the
question
entirely.
i
don’t
think
the
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
they
predicate
it
on
the
fact
that
they
were
relying
on
the
--
that
this
rule
had
continued,
since
the
kahan
days.
and
that
they
did
not
feel
that
since
it
had
been
an
established
practice
in
california
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
that
it
should
be
overturned.
and,
i
think
they
distinguished
in
the
opinion,
the
question
of
standing
from
a
question
of
fourth
amendment
protection.
mr.
russell
iungerich
it
has
a
one
liner
difference,
they’re
virtually
identical.
the
difference
is
that
seizure
and
search
rather
than
search
and
seizure.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
am
familiar
with
the
case;
i
am
not
familiar
with
all
the
facts
in
the
record
in
that
matter
your
honor.
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
clear
from
the
california
decisions.
mr.
russell
iungerich
in
this
case
and
under
the
search
and
seizure
question.
and
secondly,
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
i
certain
can,
your
honor,
possibly
be
the
end
of
the
week,
since
it
would
be
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
yes,
it
did.
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
it
most
certainly
is,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
most
clearly
come
forward
and
state
that
they
are
relying
on
that
and
as
the
anderson
case
strike
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
well,
i
think
we
don’t
have
that
ambiguity
in
this
case.
i
think
we
must
be
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
--
referring
mr.
justice
brennan
to
the
kirchner
opinion,
but
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
but
i
don’t
think
we
have
that
same
situation
in
this
case,
because
there
isn’t
any
ambiguity
in
this
opinion.
and,
i
think
the
case
is
that
--
mr.
russell
iungerich
i
think
the
difference
here
is
that
the
california
--
mr.
justice
burke
expressly
states
in
this
opinion
that
he’s
relying
on
california
law
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
compelled
by
katz
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and,
as
clearly
indicated
in
--
they
could
indicate
some
possible
reference.
in
the
other
decisions,
they
did
mention
in
their
prior
decisions
and
garbage
collection
cases,
the
edwards
decision
and
the
bradley
decision,
they
indicated
that
the
case
did
have
some
emanations
from
the
california
constitution
whereas,
in
this
case,
there
were
none.
