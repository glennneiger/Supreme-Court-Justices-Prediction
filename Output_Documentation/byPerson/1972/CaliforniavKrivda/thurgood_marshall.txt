justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn’t
--
didn’t
the
whole
point,
the
other
side
that
the
man
assumes
that
his
garbage
will
not
be
turned
over
to
the
police.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
police
was
not
in
the
garbage
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
would
--
well,
suppose
the
can
was
covered.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don’t
you
think
that
he
would
assume
that
nobody
would
get
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
county
this
occurred
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
times
did
the
police
examined
garbage
in
los
angeles?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
--
i
still
say,
couldn’t
i
assume
that
the
police
would
not
look
into
my
garbage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
know
if
any
--
there
is
other
act
of
privacy
than
have
my
garbage
co-mingle
with
a
thousand
other
people’s
garbage.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
think
we
can
decide
this
case
without
allowing
somebody
to
hide
a
dead
body?
i
think
if
you
think
we
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn’t
the
police
just
look
into
the
can
themselves?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
identical
with
the
federal
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
in
this
case
if
we
rule
the
same
way
and
give
you
all
the
relief
you
want,
couldn’t
california
say,
“well,
we’re
doing
on
the
state
one.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
would
you
win
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
oppositions,
they
only
way
they
could
make
it
clear,
because
they
didn’t
put
the
quotes
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
the
only
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
that
that’s
not
necessary
once
that
you
cite
the
pages,
isnt’
it
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
anything
to
do
with
that
picture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
respondents
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
will
that
help
their
position
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
if
he
thinks
its
private,
does
that
help
him
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
your
position
that
this
man
knew
that
all
these
things
have
in
the
garbage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
why
do
you
need
the
movie?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
need
the
movie?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
lower
court
see
that
movie?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
anybody
see
it
before
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
your
client
is
getting
rid
of
this
marijuana,
do
you
equate
that
to
abandonment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
difference
between
getting
rid
of
something
and
abandonment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
know
of
any
other
way
to
get
rid
of
a
marijuana
but
than
to
put
it
in
the
garbage?
