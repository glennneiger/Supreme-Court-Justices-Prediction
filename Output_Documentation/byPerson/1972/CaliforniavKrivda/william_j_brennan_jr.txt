would
the
case
be
any
different
if
the
barrels
had
been
on
the
back
porch,
where
the
trash
collectors
had
to
go
through
the
property
across
the
front
lawn
to
get
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why,
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
circumstance
putting
the
trash
in
the
barrel
would
not
be
abandonment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn’t
your
supreme
court
adopt
the
exclusionary
rule
and
--
before
we
ever
apply
that
in
mapp,
under
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
didn't
they
do
it
under
the
--
under
your
cons
--
state
constitution
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
difference
between
the
standing
rules
in
search
and
seizure
cases
that
as
announced
by
your
supreme
court
and
the
federal
rules?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
they
predicate
it
upon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
you’re
comparable
fourth
amendment
provision
in
the
california
constitution,
literally
tracks
it,
that’s
not
identical
in
phraseology
with
the
fourth
amendment,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you’re
familiar
i
am
sure
with
your
supreme
court’s
opinion
in
the
serrano
case,
doesn’t
involve
this
issue,
but
the
tax
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
was
thinking
of
the
opinion,
i
noticed
reading
the
opinion
yesterday
that
while
--
like
this
one,
it’s
all
--
relies
upon
the
federal
constitutional
decisions,
decision
of
this
court,
in
reaching
the
conclusion
to
unequal
protection
grounds,
you
got
to
drop
the
footnote,
which
is
said
the
question
under
the
state
constitution
was
raised
and
since
the
state
constitution
or
provision
is
virtually
the
same,
but
we
say
here
for
the
federal
constitution
goes
for
the
state
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
and
again,
last
term
in
the
death
penalty
cases,
the
california
supreme
court
clearly
rested
its
decision
in
death
penalty
cases
on
the
california
constitution,
and
said
so,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
the
practice
of
that
court
when
it
does
it,
to
say
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
it’s
only
a
few
years
ago,
i
can’t
remember
the
name
of
the
case,
we
had
to
send
one
back
to
the
california
supreme
court,
because
we
couldn’t
tell,
reading
its
opinion
whether
it
rested
on
a
state
or
a
federal
constitutional
grounds.
and
they
reviewed
it,
and
said,
“well,
anyone
who
can
read
would
know
we
rested
it
on
state
constitutional
grounds,
i
couldn’t.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
don’t
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

kirchner
is
what
i
am
referring
to
in
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn’t
read
--
it
reads
to
me
much
as
kirchner
opinion
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
justice
burke
wrote
that
opinion,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
within
kirchner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn’t
it
--
mr.
hanson,
that
just
that
we
did
it
kirchner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there’s
equally
no
question,
i
gather
that
not
as
overtly
at
least,
krivda,
the
krivda
opinion
makes
the
reference
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
see.

william

that

those,

very

of
it.
