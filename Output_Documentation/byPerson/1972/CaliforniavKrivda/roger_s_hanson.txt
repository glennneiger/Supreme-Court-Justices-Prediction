mr.
roger
s.
hanson
thank
you
your
honor,
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’ll
pick
up
where
mr.
iungerich
left
off
here,
because
i
think
it’s
important
for
this
court
to
realize
that
this
case,
people
versus
krivda
was
a
second
california
garbage
can
decision.
the
first
case,
people
versus
edwards,
71
cal.
2d
1096,
dealt
with
a
situation
slightly
different.
in
riverside
county
california,
which
is
a
more
rural
type
of
county,
the
police
walled
at
the
back
fence
of
the
home
of
the
edwards’,
came
upon
their
property,
went
into
the
garbage
can
and
that
garbage
can
was
setting
on
the
back
step.
in
that
particular
case,
the
california
supreme
court
held
5:2,
specifically
stating,
under
article
i
section
19
of
the
state
constitution
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
also
relying
of
course
on
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
ambiguity
whatsoever
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
my
brief,
starting
on
page
91,
i
have
cited
verbatim
the
edwards
opinion,
excerpt
from
the
edwards’
opinion.
i’d
like
to
simply
call
that
to
the
court’s
attention
on
page
92
of
my
brief.
it
says
accordingly
that
search
was
unlawful
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution,
it
similarly
violated
article
i
section
19
of
the
california
constitution.
the
trial
court
does
error
in
admitting
the
evidence
found
in
the
trashcan,
people
versus
edwards,
71
cal.
2d
1096,
at
pages
1104
and
1105.
now,
in
the
krivda
decision
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes,
justice
burke
wrote
that
opinion
and
justice
burke
also
wrote
the
krivda
opinion.
going
over
to
page
93
of
my
brief
at
page
367,
the
california
court
said
and
i
quote
now
from
krivda,
“it
is
also
clear,
as
in
edwards,
that
defendants’
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
was
violated
by
unreasonable
government
intrusion.
see
people
versus
edwards,
supra,
71
cal.
2d
1096,
1104-1105.
we
should
hesitate
to
encourage
a
practice
whereby
our
citizens’
trashcans
could
be
made
the
subject
of
police
inspection
without
the
protection
of
applying
for
and
securing
a
search
warrant.”
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
ambiguity
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that’s
within
the
decisions
of
this
court
but
i
just
don’t
see
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i’m
not
familiar
with
kirchner,
your
honor,
i’ll
be
honest
with
the
court.
but
in
this
particular
case,
there’s
no
question
that
edwards
overtly
was
decided
on
article
1
section
19
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
disagree
with
that,
because
it
cites
the
exact
paginations
where
this
decision
is
found,
1104
and
1105
of
71
cal
2d
1096.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
would
appreciate
the
court
parous
pages
91,
92,
93
in
my
brief.
i
think
it’s
as
clear
as
a
bell,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
very
definitely,
very
definitely.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
don’t
see
i
could
be
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
was
not
trial
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
haven’t.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
do
not.
but
it
certainly
was
decided
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
don’t
think
that
matters,
i
think
it’s
what
the
california
supreme
court
decided
in
this
case,
and
they
decided
that
was
illegal
under
the
state
constitution
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
don’t
think
so.
not
in
the
opinions
of
this
court.
i
think
in
all
of
the
opinions
in
this
court,
the
court
simply
goes
to
what
the
state
supreme
court
based
their
opinion
on.
that’s
my
understanding
in
reading
of
minnesota
versus
national
tea
and
so
forth.
now
in
addition,
i
that
that
the
second
point
is
it
really
doesn’t
matter,
because
under
this
court’s
decision
in
cooper
versus
california,
which
i’ve
cited
repletely
in
my
brief,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference,
because
the
state
supreme
court
of
california
is
permitted,
as
far
as
this
court
goes,
to
provide
more
stringent
fourth
amendment
protection
and
this
court
is
mandating
under
federal
constitution.
and,
i
think
impliedly,
impliedly
the
california
supreme
court
has
given
protection
to
the
domestic
garbage
can.
now,
i
am
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
and
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
and
several
of
the
lower
federal
courts
have
not
gone
along
with
protection
of
domestic
garbage
cans,
but
that
is
not
immaterial,
because
i
think
that
cooper
versus
california
stands
as
authority
for
the
fact
that
a
state
supreme
court
can
give
more
rigid
fourth
amendment
protection
to
its
citizens
if
it
wishes
too.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
all
i
can
again
certify
to
this
court
is
that
in
the
krivda
opinion,
it’s
cited
specifically,
pages
1104
and
1105
of
the
edwards
decision,
which
was
very
explicit
on
article
1
or
section
1,
article
xix
of
california
constitution.
now,
while
it
did
not
say
we
are
going
beyond
the
federal
constitution
--
i
agree
to
that.
it
did
not
say
that
in
this
opinion,
we’re
going
beyond
what
the
federal
constitution
requires
in
giving
protection
to
this
garbage
can.
certainly
impliedly,
that’s
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
california
supreme
court
i
think
is
a
very
erudite
court.
if
the
courts
study
these
things
very
closely,
it
is
probably
the
leading
state
supreme
in
united
states.
and
i
think
that
these
cases
were
very
thoroughly
studied
by
that
court
and
it
gave
this
protection.
now,
one
thing
i
think
that
is
very
important
in
this
decision
is
there
has
always
been,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
state
of
california
that
this
property
was
abandoned.
now
it’d
be
my
contention,
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
concept
of
abandoned
property
deals
with
not
federal
matters,
it
deals
with
what
the
state
supreme
courts
decide
--
constitutes
abandonment
in
the
state
of
california.
now,
my
opponent
has
cited
in
his
brief,
certain
law
review
articles.
he
cited
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
but
the
question
is
what
is
law
of
the
state
of
california
concerned
with
abandonment?
i
think
first
of
all
we
got
to
say
that
anybody
that
really
overtly
places
contraband
in
the
trashcan
or
deals
with
contraband
as
vitally
concerned
with
what
happens
to
that
property.
this
is
after
all
a
prosecution
for
a
possession,
and
if
it’s
a
prosecution
for
possession,
the
people
are
deemed
to
still
have
some
type
of
possessory
interest
in
this
particular
problem.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
surely
that’s
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
all
right,
very
well,
but
the
question
is,
are
they
concerned
as
to
what
happens
to
it
and
who
thereafter
may
get
a
hold
of
it?
and
in
our
supreme
court
decision
of
people
versus
erwin,
which
is
the
1
cal
3d.
423
opinion,
the
supreme
court
of
california
again
says
the
following,
“abandonment
is
defined
as
a
voluntary
giving
up
of
the
thing
by
the
owner,
because
he
no
longer
desires
to
possess
it
or
to
assert
any
right
or
dominion
over
it.”
and
now,
the
important
thing,
“and
as
entirely
indifferent
as
to
what
may
be
come
off
it
or
as
to
--
or
as
to
who
may
thereafter
possess
it.”
and,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
if
in
fact
we
have
a
bona
fide
dealing
in
contraband,
anybody
that
does
that,
you’re
dealing
in
cocaine,
you’re
dealing
in
heroin,
i
deal
with
these
people
all
the
time
out
in
california
in
defending
them.
they’re
vitally
concerned
with
what
happens
to
it
and
so
under
the
strict
definition
of
abandonment,
it
is
not
been
abandoned
as
defined
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
that
is
not,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
a
constitutionally
issue,
which
this
court
may
take
a
look
at.
question
is
what
is
our
state
supreme
court
said
about
it,
i
say
that
they
have
said
that
it
is
not
abandoned
in
this
particular
case.
now,
further
more
the
decisions
of
the
california
supreme
court
again
in
the
field
of
search
and
seizure
in
our
marshall
decision
of
69
cal
2d
51
and
then
our
mcgrew
decision,
1
cal
3d.
404,
there
is
language
in
those
decisions
as
specifically
preclude
the
going
into
close
opaque
containers
without
a
search
warrant.
that
does
not
confide
the
containers
in
the
home,
there’s
a
(inaudible)
decisions,
mcgrew
abt,
so
forth
in
1
cal
3d.,
which
proscribed
going
in
to
close
containers
at
airports.
so,
we
have
a
closed
garbage
can
here.
not
only
do
we
have
a
closed
garbage
can,
but
within
that
closed
garbage
can,
we
have
closed
opaque
brown
bags.
and
they
could
not
have
gone
in
those
bags
without
violating
the
california
law,
without
getting
a
search
warrant.
now,
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
do
that,
of
course,
is
because
the
garbage
hollers
employed
the
police,
as
the
police
--
the
garbage
hollers
as
police
agents,
told
them
exactly
what
to
do,
intercept
the
truck
a
block
away
from
the
house,
go
pick
the
stuff
up,
make
sure
the
well
of
the
truck
is
cleaned
out
so
there’s
no
commingling,
take
it
a
block
away.
they
directed
everything
they
did
and
it’s
my
contention
that
these
garbage
hollers
became
police
agents
for
the
purpose
of
this
particular
pick
up.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
don’t
know,
i’m
sure
that
they
probably
requested,
and
they
requested
or
commanded
or
demanded,
there’s
something
other
than
--
i
suppose
it
was
a
friendly
confrontation,
i
don’t
know
exactly
how
it
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
oh!
i’m
sure
there
is,
usually
a
difference
between
requested,
but
you
know,
garbage
hollers
are
in
generally
not
the
most
educated
people
and
they
--
i
think
they’re
more
compliant
with
request
of
police.
i
don’t
think
they
questioned
anything
that
they
want
them
to
do.
they
went
ahead
and
did
this.
and
i
think
under
the
general
stoner
versus
california
and
chapman
versus
united
states
rationale,
it
is
expected
that
a
maid
will
clean
your
room,
but
it
is
not
expected
she’s
going
to
lead
them
on
a
tour
of
your
possessions.
when
you
rent
a
house,
it’s
expected
that
the
man
may
come
in
to
inspect
the
premises,
but
it’s
not
expected
that
he’s
going
to
bring
the
revenue
agency
in
under
chapman
versus
united
states.
i
think
that
is
axiomatic
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
not
expected
that
these
garbage
hollers
are
going
to
comply
with
the
request
of
the
police
department.
now,
furthermore
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
definitely
not.
i
think
the
court’s
attention
must
be
referred
to
section
6603
of
the
city
code
and
section
6629
of
the
city
code.
now,
if
--
it’d
be
contended
that
officers
are
exempted,
they’re
certainly
employees
of
the
city.
and
section
6629
says
this,
it
says
“no
employee
of
this
city
shall
remove
or
dispose
of
for
said
employees
benefit
or
use
any
of
the
contents
of
any
vessel,
tankers,
receptacle
used
for
the
collection,
removal
or
disposal
of
rubbish.”
so,
i
think
--
i
--
first
of
all
i’m
not
conceding
whatsoever
that
an
officer
in
the
context
of
view
there
is
a
police
officer.
i
think
that’s
a
garbage
officer
of
some
nature.
there
must
be
a
chain
of
command
in
the
garbage
business
also.
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
in
any
way
permits
police
officers
to
go
after
this.
i
don’t
think
it
does
at
all.
in
any
way
they’re
employees
and
so
section
6629
does
not
permit
them
to
do
this.
while
in
general,
i
admit
the
rationale
of
this
court
in
abel,
but
nonetheless
in
california
versus
krivda,
we
have
a
very
heavy
regulation
on
california
garbage,
very
heavily
regulated
and
it
just
absolutely
precludes
this
particular
behavior
that
took
place
in
this
case.
and,
not
only
does
the
municipal
county
ordinance
is
precluded
but
they
taken
in
context
with
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment
to
u.s.
constitution,
suggest
to
me
that
where
the
states
have
not
overtly
legislated
and/or
the
federal
government
has
not
overtly
legislated
then
it
is
up
to
the
citizens,
acting
through
their
municipalities,
to
legislate
and
these
statutes
actually
absolutely
preclude
this
type
of
confiscation
of
the
garbage
can.
now,
those
are
the
threshold
of
the
laws
and
i
would
like
now
to
address
myself
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
anybody
that
says
in
recognizing
the
certified
question,
and
certified
question
came
up
to
this
court
was
whether
there
is
--
whether
anybody
who
takes
contraband
and
puts
it
an
a
garbage
can
and
puts
to
that
curb
side,
exhibits
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
that
garbage
will
not
be
viewed
in
the
well
or
the
bin
of
the
garbage
truck
some
distance
away
from
pick
up
and
prior
to
commingling.
now,
i
have
a
little
garbage
truck
here
which
i
purchased
over
in
virginia
yesterday
and
this
little
garbage
truck
is
one
exactly
like
that
we
have
in
california
and
to
ensure
that
the
court
understand
what
california
garbage
trucks
look
like,
this
is
what
they
talk
about
when
they
say
the
well
of
the
truck,
this
is
the
well
of
the
truck
back
here.
and
characteristically,
these
trucks
move
along
the
streets
in
california
and
they
have
a
very
heavy
schedule
to
meet.
a
lot
of
homes
to
meet
and
there
will
be
a
man
standing
on
the
back
of
this
truck
and
a
man
driving
the
truck,
and
they
will
drive
up
to
a
home,
this
man
will
jump
off
at
the
back
of
the
truck,
he
will
take
the
cans,
he
will
append
them
into
the
well.
he
will
hit
a
hydraulic
button
and
within
2
or
3
seconds,
it
is
elevated
into
the
truck.
within
2
or
3
seconds,
it
is
elevated
into
the
truck.
there’s
absolutely
no
opportunity,
no
practical
opportunity
at
all
for
this
to
be
viewed
in
the
well
of
the
truck.
this
is
a
very
smelly
place,
it
is
covered
with
dust,
when
they
dump
these
trucks,
these
cans
in
here,
there
is
an
emanation
of
dust
that
comes
out
of
the
end
of
it,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
practically
nor
reasonably
to
expect
that
anybody
is
going
to
view
what’s
going
on
in
the
well
of
that
truck,
that
button
is
hit,
it
is
gone
in
three
seconds
and
actually,
even
though
this
model
of
the
truck
has
a
top
of
it
gone,
the
california
garbage
truck
is
closed
there
and
this
garbage
disappears
into
that
truck
within
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
nobody
ever
sees
it
again,
until
it
is
out
to
the
dump.
and,
in
california,
one
of
the
big
uses
of
garbage
is
for
landfills.
we
have
a
lot
of
mountains
out
there,
and
they
are
dumped
in
mountains
and
they
are
covered
over
with
bulldozers.
now,
i
have
a
movie
with
me
and
if
the
court
would
take
a
look
at
it
before
this
court
decides
this
case.
it
is
two
minutes
and
57
seconds,
it
is
a
totally
unrehearsed
movie,
which
is
in
color
in
16
millimeter
and
it
shows
california
garbage,
i
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
what’s
that?
no,
it’s
not
but
i
presumed
there’s
a
--
[laughter]
--
because
of
the
cases
that
are
coming
up.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
it’s
not
but
nonetheless
it
is
argument
at
least.
it
is
argument
at
least
and
it
is
factual,
i
represent
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
posed;
it
is
very
correctly
done;
it
is
done
by
myself
supervisingly
taking
the
pictures
of
how
they
actually
pick
up
garbage.
it
shows
the
california’s
smog
levels,
there’s
a
demarcation
in
california
of
a
brown
bell
of
smog
in
blue
sky.
and
that
is
another
reason
why
this
has
to
be
done
in
california.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
is
what?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
they
did
--
the
respondents,
no
they
did
not.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
because
it’s
very
typical
how
it’s
done
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
it
shows,
the
question
again
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
if
he
is
at
all
that
alert,
he
knows
that
this
is
what
happens
to
him,
because
i’ve
seen
many
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
what’s
that?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
thought
it
would
help
the
court
to
confirm
my
contentions
as
to
how
california
garbage
is
picked
up.
if
the
court
will
view
it
i’d
appreciate
it.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
very
important
here
is
really
the
california
said
is
it
operates
under
a
contract
of
adhesion
early.
he
cannot
get
rid
of
the
garbage
in
any
other
way.
you
can’t
burn
california
garbage.
you
can’t
do
anything
like
that,
because
of
the
smog
levels
out
there.
the
only
thing
you
can
do
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
a
drawl,
just
carry
it
out
to
the
curb
side.
you
can’t
leave
it
behind
your
house,
because
if
you
do,
they
won’t
pick
it
up.
you
maybe
be
able
to
do
that
in
some
of
the
small
towns
i
don’t
know,
but
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
the
only
way
you
can
get
rid
of
it
and
it’s
covered
by
these
statutes
in
my
brief,
is
to
carry
it
out
to
the
curb
side.
and,
the
california
supreme
court,
even
in
its
dissent,
in
its
three-man
dissent
in
the
krivda
case,
recognized
the
right
of
privacy
in
that
can
when
it
was
on
the
back
step
of
the
home.
but,
somehow
and
i
contend
this
is
an
intellectual
non
sequitur,
they
seem
to
lose
three
votes
when
it
was
carried
out
to
the
curb,
and
i
don’t
understand
that
because
this
is
what
people
have
to
do.
if
you
did
not
do
that
you
would
have
the
home
being
engulfed
in
garbage
because
you
never
get
rid
of
it.
you
have
to
carry
it
out
to
the
curb
and
get
rid
of
it.
and,
they’re
doing
--
my
clients
were
doing
only
what
they
had
to
do
in
order
to
get
rid
of
this.
we
have
a
very
regulated
situation
in
california,
and
i
don’t
think
that
these
people
can
be
held
to
have
given
up
any
right
of
privacy
simply
because
they
had
to
carry
this
can
out
to
the
curb
side
in
order
to
get
rid
of
it.
and
so
therefore
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
distinguishment
between
the
edwards
case
and
the
krivda
case
in
the
state
of
california.
now,
i
think
also
of
great
importance
is
the
following:
is
there
a
possibility
of
detecting
contraband
under
these
circumstances.
i
defend
in
california
a
lot
of
drug
cases.
i
have
never
seen,
never
seen
at
all
even
licensed
chemist
who
are
able
to
detect
contraband
without
doing
analysis
and
i’m
talking
here
about
marijuana
and
pills
and
so
forth.
you
can’t
tell
the
majority
of
white
pills
are
morphine
tablets.
so
therefore
you
have
a
university
trained
chemist
who
has
to
make
quite
extensive
test
to
detect
contraband
and
therefore
i
would
contend
that
the
average
person
who
would
have
a
split
second
chance
to
view
contraband
in
the
well
of
this
garbage
truck
would
have
no
chance,
no
chance
at
all
to
detect
it
whatsoever.
he
could
not
possibly
detect
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
it
goes
to
a
landfill
mr.
justice
powell,
where
it’s
plowed
over
by
bulldozers
to
make
landfill
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
all
the
time,
they’re
out
there
all
the
time.
when
those
trucks
bring
it
out
they
are
constantly
out
there,
weaving
back
and
forth
on
the
land
and
disposing
of
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
in
general,
well,
there
maybe,
yes,
there
maybe,
but
that’s
in
this
movie
also.
i’d
like
to
have
the
court
take
a
look
at
it.
this
is
an
unrehearsed
movie
of
the
california
dumps,
showing
where
this,
what
happens
in
this
stuff?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no
they
didn’t,
i
have
made
this
movie
two
weeks
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
nobody
had
seen
it.
but
i
again
offer
to
this
court
for
the
realization
as
to
what
takes
place
in
california
garbage
dumps.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
don’t.
i
equate
this
to
a
requirement
as
to
how
you
have
to
dispose
of
something,
it’s
not
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
under
the
general
idea
of
abandonment
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
abandonment
would
be
just
some
free
will,
free
desire
to
get
rid
of
something.
here,
you
have
a
very
regulated
way
that
you
have
to
do
it.
you’re
disposing
of
something
pursuant
to
statute,
pursuant
to
statute.
you
can’t
do
it
any
other
way
in
california,
unless
you
want
to
get
into
the
business
yourself
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes,
i
think
you
could
flush
that
down
the
toilet
or
some
people
do
who
are
kind
of
hard
press
for
it,
they’ll
roll
it
over
again
in
a
new
cigarette,
i
think
you
could
do
that.
but,
i
don’t
know,
i
had
never
fooled
with
it
myself,
other
than
represent
these
people
but
i
am
told
that
they
will
recycle
their
marijuana
into
new
cigarettes
when
it
gets
down
to
the
end.
now,
one
thing
i
think
that
we
got
to
distinguish
here
is
--
i
am
sure
the
state
of
california
is
probably
not
suggesting
widespread
indiscriminate
searching
of
garbage
cans.
if
they
are,
i
would
contend,
as
i
have
in
my
brief,
if
this
is
a
mathematical
impossibility.
it’s
a
statistic
impossibility
that
there
is
just
no
possibility
that
this
is
going
to
be
successful
when
you
talk
about
the
number
of
police
that
can
be
devoted
to
it
versus
number
of
garbage
cans.
so
therefore,
we
have
to
talk
about
a
situation
where
there’s
some
type
of
information,
some
type
of
premonition
that
a
can
contains
contraband
and
in
those
particular
circumstances,
i
contend
that
the
search
warrant
is
a
preferred
way,
aguilar
versus
texas,
spinelli
versus
united
states,
whiteley
versus
warden
of
wyoming
state
prison,
and
all
the
various
decisions
of
this
court
which
actually
require
--
and
i
suggest
also
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire.
as
i
read
coolidge
in
the
91
supreme
court
addition
2022
at
page
2047,
this
court
has
restricted
the
particular
ways
of
seizing
things
anymore
to
either
a
search
warrant
or
its
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
and
so,
instead
of
trying
to
muddy
up
the
waters,
instead
of
trying
to
complicate
the
deal
with
search
and
seizure,
this
court
has
simplified
it
by
curtailing
the
means
by
which
somebody
can
seize
something.
so,
i
think
there’s
just
a
host
of
decisions
going
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
going
to
the
law
of
california,
going
to
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court,
invoking
article
1
section
19
in
the
edwards
case
and
incorporating
that
to
krivda
case
would
just
absolutely
preclude
this
type
of
thing
from
happening.
and
i
think
the
decision
of
this
court
should
be
nine
to
nothing
affirming
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
this
particular
case.
i
just
can’t
see
how
it
can
be
anything
else
under
the
various
things
that
have
happened
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
you
mean
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
dismiss
it
for
want
to
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
that
maybe
true.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
indiana
toll
road.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
right,
right.
now,
i
think
there’s
one
other
area
i
want
to
touch
on
in
the
closing
minutes
here.
i
think
there’s
a
very
pragmatic
situation
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
that
if
this
court
would
at
all
sanction
a
search
of
garbage
cans,
it
is
an
avenue,
if
you
open
up
numerous
areas
of
fraud,
because
a
garbage
can
as
this
court
i
think
is
almost
a
judicial
notice
can
be
loaded
by
somebody
who
wants
to
get
rid
of
somebody
else.
if
i
want
to
get
rid
of
my
neighbor,
i’ll
go
and
deposit
marijuana
in
the
can,
i
make
an
anonymous
phone
call
to
the
police
department,
i
say,
“mr.
jones
at
123
main
street
has
marijuana
in
the
garbage
can,”
zoom!
they
come
over,
they
descend
on
the
can,
they
search
it,
they
find
marijuana
and
he
is
off
to
the
poky.
and
if
you
don’t
think
it’s
difficult
to
defend
these
drug
cases
in
california,
well
you
got
another
thing
that
coming,
because
i
did
--
do
it
all
day
and
it’s
very
emotionally
laden
and
it’s
very
difficult
to
get
these
people
off,
if
they’re
caught
in
anyway
with
narcotics
before
a
jury.
they
think
that
they’re
guilty,
there’s
no
way
you
can
do
it,
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
court
any
way
gives
any
credence
to
the
desire
to
the
california
attorney
general,
we
have
some
problems,
we
have
some
severe
problems
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
also,
i
think
also
we
have
the
final
threshold
question
as
to
the
right
of
privacy
of
people
to
live
their
lives,
to
dispose
of
their
life’s
tracings
if
might
be
birth
control,
residue,
or
if
it
might
be
a
particular
liquor
that
they
want
to
use
or
something
i
think
that
it
is
a
severe
encroachment
upon
the
right
of
privacy,
if
this
court
would
in
any
way
suggest
that
the
california
police
should
be
given
the
right
to
indiscriminately
search
these
cans.
citing
griswold
versus
connecticut,
i
think
that
the
birth
control
privacy,
the
bedroom
should
be
extended
to
the
--
getting
rid
of
that
birth
control
material
out
into
the
garbage
can.
and,
also
i
think
there
is
a
severe
equal
protection
problem,
because
if
this
whole
matter
depends
on
where
that
can
might
be
setting
or
whether
you
might
be
living
in
a
rural
area,
residential
area,
i
think
that
--
i
think
it’s
a
refinement
that
we
don’t
want
to
go
into.
many
people
live
in
huge
apartment
houses
where
there
is
a
commingling
in
the
--
in
a
huge
trashcan.
there
you
don’t
have
the
problem,
because
it’s
initially
commingled,
but
if
you
don’t
have
the
situation
where
you’re
living
under
circumstances
like
that
or
you’re
living
in
a
private
home,
of
course,
then
you
have
to
comply
with
the
regulations
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
and
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
how
you
get
rid
of
these
materials.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
certainly
it
does,
i
recognize
this,
i
recognize
this.
now,
no
one
has
said
in
argument
yet
about
the
general
attack
on
matt
versus
ohio,
but
in
the
couple
of
minutes
i
have
left,
assuming
my
opponent
is
going
to
allude
to
it
in
his
closing
arguments.
i
think
that
somebody
of
my
particular
educational
status
is
not
going
to,
in
the
few
minutes,
in
any
way,
attempt
to
overcome
the
scholars
of
the
last
50
years
who
have
considered,
debated,
discussed,
published
law
review
article
by
the
thousands
on
the
exclusionary
rule,
i
think
that
the
state
of
california
is
now
in
a
position
where
frankly
there’s
been
an
addition
of
four
new
members
to
this
court
and
the
--
i
think
they
feel
that
they
can
take
a
new
shot
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
this
court
should
not
likely
consider
in
a
solemnest
rule.
there
is
really
no
other
practical
way,
no
other
practical
way.
some
people
may
say,
pursue
of
42
u.s.c.
1983
civil
right
suit,
but
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
if
somebody
is
caught
with
a
bunch
of
cocaine
and
it
is
shown
to
be
an
illegal
seizure,
but
because
you
can’t
exclude
it,
the
man
is
convicted,
he
does
maybe
ten
years,
he
makes
$50,000
a
year
of
selling
cocaine,
he
brings
a
civil
rights
suit
to
recover
$50,000
times
ten
years,
or
$500,000.
what
jury
in
the
united
states
would
give
him
ten
cents,
a
man
who
is
dealing
in
cocaine,
brings
a
civil
right
suit
to
recover
money,
because
he
had
been
illegally
searched
and
seized,
can
anybody
in
their
wildest
imagination
should
suggest
that
man
would
get
any
money?
i
don’t
think
so.
there
really
is
practically
no
relief
under
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act.
some
people
may
suggest,
well,
we
should
discipline
the
police.
i
don’t
think
this
is
practical,
i
think
this
has
been
hash
and
rehashed
for
years.
it
is
not
a
practical
way
of
handling
it.
the
only
way
it
can
be
done
is
by
the
--
this
exclusionary
rule
and
i
think
that
the
scholars
of
the
last
fifty
years,
emanating
from
weeks
versus
united
states
down
through
matt
versus
ohio
have
so
considered,
and
there
just
is
really
no
other
way
of
doing
it.
if
the
state
of
california
is
really
sincere
in
this,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
may
give
some
credence
to
a
parallel
type
of
relief,
along
with
this
exclusionary
rule,
to
see
how
it
works.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
the
bivens
versus
six
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics
expressed
the
reluctance
to
throw
away
the
exclusionary
rule
in
illinios
and
alternate
could
be
selected.
and
so,
i
think
that
if
there’s
any
credence
to
be
given
to
an
alternate
let
it
go
in
a
parallel
manner
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
let’s
all
investigate
and
see
what
happens.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
probably
still
be
in
effect,
because
the
alternates
are
merely
shams
that
they
really
will
not
work
too
well.
california
talks
about
restricting
it
to
substantial
violations,
and
i
would
suggest
that
we’re
getting
into
replete
additional
things,
which
are
going
to
be
more
complicated,
because
then
you
are
going
to
have
got
to
decide
where
there
is
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
search
where
it
has
already
been
held
to
be
somewhat
unreasonable.
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
nuisances
on
--
nuisances
on
this
particular
thing
to
the
point
where
anybody
that
would
want
it
had
to
happen
would
give
up
in
despair
on
it.
even
in
the
amicus
curia
briefs,
the
reasons
for
doing
away
with
it,
the
americans
for
effective
law
enforcement
presents
statistics
that
show
that
the
police
are
doing
so
well
with
an
84%,
6
out
of
7
cases,
the
attack
on
the
search
and
seizure
has
been
upheld
as
being
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
california
in
this
brief
says,
“well,
the
thing
is
so
complicated
our
police
can’t
understand
it.”
i
think
that
and
that
alone
is
reason
for
disinterested,
neutral
magistrate,
who
has
had
training
in
law
to
set
and
decide
if
it’s
legal
or
illegal.
illinois
says
and
i’d
hesitate
to
admit
it
that
their
police
are
lying
so
badly.
every
time
they
get
caught
and
they’re
challenged
by
a
judge,
where
they
would
be
prone
to
lying
in
order
to
get
the
evidence
in.
well,
i
would
suggest
the
state
of
illinois
is
a
different
fact,
that’s
our
admission
that
they
ought
to
try
and
curtail
their
policemen
lying
and
go
on
the
same
rule
that
everybody
else
goes,
a
judge
is
suppose
to
decide
this.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
it’s
a
pleasure
to
do
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
thank
you
your
honor,
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’ll
pick
up
where
mr.
iungerich
left
off
here,
because
i
think
it’s
important
for
this
court
to
realize
that
this
case,
people
versus
krivda
was
a
second
california
garbage
can
decision.
the
first
case,
people
versus
edwards,
71
cal.
2d
1096,
dealt
with
a
situation
slightly
different.
in
riverside
county
california,
which
is
a
more
rural
type
of
county,
the
police
walled
at
the
back
fence
of
the
home
of
the
edwards’,
came
upon
their
property,
went
into
the
garbage
can
and
that
garbage
can
was
setting
on
the
back
step.
in
that
particular
case,
the
california
supreme
court
held
5:2,
specifically
stating,
under
article
i
section
19
of
the
state
constitution
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
also
relying
of
course
on
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
ambiguity
whatsoever
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
my
brief,
starting
on
page
91,
i
have
cited
verbatim
the
edwards
opinion,
excerpt
from
the
edwards’
opinion.
i’d
like
to
simply
call
that
to
the
court’s
attention
on
page
92
of
my
brief.
it
says
accordingly
that
search
was
unlawful
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution,
it
similarly
violated
article
i
section
19
of
the
california
constitution.
the
trial
court
does
error
in
admitting
the
evidence
found
in
the
trashcan,
people
versus
edwards,
71
cal.
2d
1096,
at
pages
1104
and
1105.
now,
in
the
krivda
decision
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes,
justice
burke
wrote
that
opinion
and
justice
burke
also
wrote
the
krivda
opinion.
going
over
to
page
93
of
my
brief
at
page
367,
the
california
court
said
and
i
quote
now
from
krivda,
“it
is
also
clear,
as
in
edwards,
that
defendants’
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
was
violated
by
unreasonable
government
intrusion.
see
people
versus
edwards,
supra,
71
cal.
2d
1096,
1104-1105.
we
should
hesitate
to
encourage
a
practice
whereby
our
citizens’
trashcans
could
be
made
the
subject
of
police
inspection
without
the
protection
of
applying
for
and
securing
a
search
warrant.”
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
ambiguity
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that’s
within
the
decisions
of
this
court
but
i
just
don’t
see
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i’m
not
familiar
with
kirchner,
your
honor,
i’ll
be
honest
with
the
court.
but
in
this
particular
case,
there’s
no
question
that
edwards
overtly
was
decided
on
article
1
section
19
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
disagree
with
that,
because
it
cites
the
exact
paginations
where
this
decision
is
found,
1104
and
1105
of
71
cal
2d
1096.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
would
appreciate
the
court
parous
pages
91,
92,
93
in
my
brief.
i
think
it’s
as
clear
as
a
bell,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
very
definitely,
very
definitely.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
don’t
see
i
could
be
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
was
not
trial
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
haven’t.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
do
not.
but
it
certainly
was
decided
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
don’t
think
that
matters,
i
think
it’s
what
the
california
supreme
court
decided
in
this
case,
and
they
decided
that
was
illegal
under
the
state
constitution
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
don’t
think
so.
not
in
the
opinions
of
this
court.
i
think
in
all
of
the
opinions
in
this
court,
the
court
simply
goes
to
what
the
state
supreme
court
based
their
opinion
on.
that’s
my
understanding
in
reading
of
minnesota
versus
national
tea
and
so
forth.
now
in
addition,
i
that
that
the
second
point
is
it
really
doesn’t
matter,
because
under
this
court’s
decision
in
cooper
versus
california,
which
i’ve
cited
repletely
in
my
brief,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference,
because
the
state
supreme
court
of
california
is
permitted,
as
far
as
this
court
goes,
to
provide
more
stringent
fourth
amendment
protection
and
this
court
is
mandating
under
federal
constitution.
and,
i
think
impliedly,
impliedly
the
california
supreme
court
has
given
protection
to
the
domestic
garbage
can.
now,
i
am
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
and
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
and
several
of
the
lower
federal
courts
have
not
gone
along
with
protection
of
domestic
garbage
cans,
but
that
is
not
immaterial,
because
i
think
that
cooper
versus
california
stands
as
authority
for
the
fact
that
a
state
supreme
court
can
give
more
rigid
fourth
amendment
protection
to
its
citizens
if
it
wishes
too.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
all
i
can
again
certify
to
this
court
is
that
in
the
krivda
opinion,
it’s
cited
specifically,
pages
1104
and
1105
of
the
edwards
decision,
which
was
very
explicit
on
article
1
or
section
1,
article
xix
of
california
constitution.
now,
while
it
did
not
say
we
are
going
beyond
the
federal
constitution
--
i
agree
to
that.
it
did
not
say
that
in
this
opinion,
we’re
going
beyond
what
the
federal
constitution
requires
in
giving
protection
to
this
garbage
can.
certainly
impliedly,
that’s
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
california
supreme
court
i
think
is
a
very
erudite
court.
if
the
courts
study
these
things
very
closely,
it
is
probably
the
leading
state
supreme
in
united
states.
and
i
think
that
these
cases
were
very
thoroughly
studied
by
that
court
and
it
gave
this
protection.
now,
one
thing
i
think
that
is
very
important
in
this
decision
is
there
has
always
been,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
state
of
california
that
this
property
was
abandoned.
now
it’d
be
my
contention,
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
concept
of
abandoned
property
deals
with
not
federal
matters,
it
deals
with
what
the
state
supreme
courts
decide
--
constitutes
abandonment
in
the
state
of
california.
now,
my
opponent
has
cited
in
his
brief,
certain
law
review
articles.
he
cited
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
but
the
question
is
what
is
law
of
the
state
of
california
concerned
with
abandonment?
i
think
first
of
all
we
got
to
say
that
anybody
that
really
overtly
places
contraband
in
the
trashcan
or
deals
with
contraband
as
vitally
concerned
with
what
happens
to
that
property.
this
is
after
all
a
prosecution
for
a
possession,
and
if
it’s
a
prosecution
for
possession,
the
people
are
deemed
to
still
have
some
type
of
possessory
interest
in
this
particular
problem.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
surely
that’s
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
all
right,
very
well,
but
the
question
is,
are
they
concerned
as
to
what
happens
to
it
and
who
thereafter
may
get
a
hold
of
it?
and
in
our
supreme
court
decision
of
people
versus
erwin,
which
is
the
1
cal
3d.
423
opinion,
the
supreme
court
of
california
again
says
the
following,
“abandonment
is
defined
as
a
voluntary
giving
up
of
the
thing
by
the
owner,
because
he
no
longer
desires
to
possess
it
or
to
assert
any
right
or
dominion
over
it.”
and
now,
the
important
thing,
“and
as
entirely
indifferent
as
to
what
may
be
come
off
it
or
as
to
--
or
as
to
who
may
thereafter
possess
it.”
and,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
if
in
fact
we
have
a
bona
fide
dealing
in
contraband,
anybody
that
does
that,
you’re
dealing
in
cocaine,
you’re
dealing
in
heroin,
i
deal
with
these
people
all
the
time
out
in
california
in
defending
them.
they’re
vitally
concerned
with
what
happens
to
it
and
so
under
the
strict
definition
of
abandonment,
it
is
not
been
abandoned
as
defined
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
that
is
not,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
a
constitutionally
issue,
which
this
court
may
take
a
look
at.
question
is
what
is
our
state
supreme
court
said
about
it,
i
say
that
they
have
said
that
it
is
not
abandoned
in
this
particular
case.
now,
further
more
the
decisions
of
the
california
supreme
court
again
in
the
field
of
search
and
seizure
in
our
marshall
decision
of
69
cal
2d
51
and
then
our
mcgrew
decision,
1
cal
3d.
404,
there
is
language
in
those
decisions
as
specifically
preclude
the
going
into
close
opaque
containers
without
a
search
warrant.
that
does
not
confide
the
containers
in
the
home,
there’s
a
(inaudible)
decisions,
mcgrew
abt,
so
forth
in
1
cal
3d.,
which
proscribed
going
in
to
close
containers
at
airports.
so,
we
have
a
closed
garbage
can
here.
not
only
do
we
have
a
closed
garbage
can,
but
within
that
closed
garbage
can,
we
have
closed
opaque
brown
bags.
and
they
could
not
have
gone
in
those
bags
without
violating
the
california
law,
without
getting
a
search
warrant.
now,
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
do
that,
of
course,
is
because
the
garbage
hollers
employed
the
police,
as
the
police
--
the
garbage
hollers
as
police
agents,
told
them
exactly
what
to
do,
intercept
the
truck
a
block
away
from
the
house,
go
pick
the
stuff
up,
make
sure
the
well
of
the
truck
is
cleaned
out
so
there’s
no
commingling,
take
it
a
block
away.
they
directed
everything
they
did
and
it’s
my
contention
that
these
garbage
hollers
became
police
agents
for
the
purpose
of
this
particular
pick
up.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
don’t
know,
i’m
sure
that
they
probably
requested,
and
they
requested
or
commanded
or
demanded,
there’s
something
other
than
--
i
suppose
it
was
a
friendly
confrontation,
i
don’t
know
exactly
how
it
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
oh!
i’m
sure
there
is,
usually
a
difference
between
requested,
but
you
know,
garbage
hollers
are
in
generally
not
the
most
educated
people
and
they
--
i
think
they’re
more
compliant
with
request
of
police.
i
don’t
think
they
questioned
anything
that
they
want
them
to
do.
they
went
ahead
and
did
this.
and
i
think
under
the
general
stoner
versus
california
and
chapman
versus
united
states
rationale,
it
is
expected
that
a
maid
will
clean
your
room,
but
it
is
not
expected
she’s
going
to
lead
them
on
a
tour
of
your
possessions.
when
you
rent
a
house,
it’s
expected
that
the
man
may
come
in
to
inspect
the
premises,
but
it’s
not
expected
that
he’s
going
to
bring
the
revenue
agency
in
under
chapman
versus
united
states.
i
think
that
is
axiomatic
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
not
expected
that
these
garbage
hollers
are
going
to
comply
with
the
request
of
the
police
department.
now,
furthermore
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
definitely
not.
i
think
the
court’s
attention
must
be
referred
to
section
6603
of
the
city
code
and
section
6629
of
the
city
code.
now,
if
--
it’d
be
contended
that
officers
are
exempted,
they’re
certainly
employees
of
the
city.
and
section
6629
says
this,
it
says
“no
employee
of
this
city
shall
remove
or
dispose
of
for
said
employees
benefit
or
use
any
of
the
contents
of
any
vessel,
tankers,
receptacle
used
for
the
collection,
removal
or
disposal
of
rubbish.”
so,
i
think
--
i
--
first
of
all
i’m
not
conceding
whatsoever
that
an
officer
in
the
context
of
view
there
is
a
police
officer.
i
think
that’s
a
garbage
officer
of
some
nature.
there
must
be
a
chain
of
command
in
the
garbage
business
also.
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
in
any
way
permits
police
officers
to
go
after
this.
i
don’t
think
it
does
at
all.
in
any
way
they’re
employees
and
so
section
6629
does
not
permit
them
to
do
this.
while
in
general,
i
admit
the
rationale
of
this
court
in
abel,
but
nonetheless
in
california
versus
krivda,
we
have
a
very
heavy
regulation
on
california
garbage,
very
heavily
regulated
and
it
just
absolutely
precludes
this
particular
behavior
that
took
place
in
this
case.
and,
not
only
does
the
municipal
county
ordinance
is
precluded
but
they
taken
in
context
with
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment
to
u.s.
constitution,
suggest
to
me
that
where
the
states
have
not
overtly
legislated
and/or
the
federal
government
has
not
overtly
legislated
then
it
is
up
to
the
citizens,
acting
through
their
municipalities,
to
legislate
and
these
statutes
actually
absolutely
preclude
this
type
of
confiscation
of
the
garbage
can.
now,
those
are
the
threshold
of
the
laws
and
i
would
like
now
to
address
myself
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
anybody
that
says
in
recognizing
the
certified
question,
and
certified
question
came
up
to
this
court
was
whether
there
is
--
whether
anybody
who
takes
contraband
and
puts
it
an
a
garbage
can
and
puts
to
that
curb
side,
exhibits
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
that
garbage
will
not
be
viewed
in
the
well
or
the
bin
of
the
garbage
truck
some
distance
away
from
pick
up
and
prior
to
commingling.
now,
i
have
a
little
garbage
truck
here
which
i
purchased
over
in
virginia
yesterday
and
this
little
garbage
truck
is
one
exactly
like
that
we
have
in
california
and
to
ensure
that
the
court
understand
what
california
garbage
trucks
look
like,
this
is
what
they
talk
about
when
they
say
the
well
of
the
truck,
this
is
the
well
of
the
truck
back
here.
and
characteristically,
these
trucks
move
along
the
streets
in
california
and
they
have
a
very
heavy
schedule
to
meet.
a
lot
of
homes
to
meet
and
there
will
be
a
man
standing
on
the
back
of
this
truck
and
a
man
driving
the
truck,
and
they
will
drive
up
to
a
home,
this
man
will
jump
off
at
the
back
of
the
truck,
he
will
take
the
cans,
he
will
append
them
into
the
well.
he
will
hit
a
hydraulic
button
and
within
2
or
3
seconds,
it
is
elevated
into
the
truck.
within
2
or
3
seconds,
it
is
elevated
into
the
truck.
there’s
absolutely
no
opportunity,
no
practical
opportunity
at
all
for
this
to
be
viewed
in
the
well
of
the
truck.
this
is
a
very
smelly
place,
it
is
covered
with
dust,
when
they
dump
these
trucks,
these
cans
in
here,
there
is
an
emanation
of
dust
that
comes
out
of
the
end
of
it,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
practically
nor
reasonably
to
expect
that
anybody
is
going
to
view
what’s
going
on
in
the
well
of
that
truck,
that
button
is
hit,
it
is
gone
in
three
seconds
and
actually,
even
though
this
model
of
the
truck
has
a
top
of
it
gone,
the
california
garbage
truck
is
closed
there
and
this
garbage
disappears
into
that
truck
within
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
nobody
ever
sees
it
again,
until
it
is
out
to
the
dump.
and,
in
california,
one
of
the
big
uses
of
garbage
is
for
landfills.
we
have
a
lot
of
mountains
out
there,
and
they
are
dumped
in
mountains
and
they
are
covered
over
with
bulldozers.
now,
i
have
a
movie
with
me
and
if
the
court
would
take
a
look
at
it
before
this
court
decides
this
case.
it
is
two
minutes
and
57
seconds,
it
is
a
totally
unrehearsed
movie,
which
is
in
color
in
16
millimeter
and
it
shows
california
garbage,
i
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
what’s
that?
no,
it’s
not
but
i
presumed
there’s
a
--
[laughter]
--
because
of
the
cases
that
are
coming
up.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
it’s
not
but
nonetheless
it
is
argument
at
least.
it
is
argument
at
least
and
it
is
factual,
i
represent
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
posed;
it
is
very
correctly
done;
it
is
done
by
myself
supervisingly
taking
the
pictures
of
how
they
actually
pick
up
garbage.
it
shows
the
california’s
smog
levels,
there’s
a
demarcation
in
california
of
a
brown
bell
of
smog
in
blue
sky.
and
that
is
another
reason
why
this
has
to
be
done
in
california.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
is
what?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
they
did
--
the
respondents,
no
they
did
not.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
because
it’s
very
typical
how
it’s
done
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
it
shows,
the
question
again
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
if
he
is
at
all
that
alert,
he
knows
that
this
is
what
happens
to
him,
because
i’ve
seen
many
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
what’s
that?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
thought
it
would
help
the
court
to
confirm
my
contentions
as
to
how
california
garbage
is
picked
up.
if
the
court
will
view
it
i’d
appreciate
it.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
very
important
here
is
really
the
california
said
is
it
operates
under
a
contract
of
adhesion
early.
he
cannot
get
rid
of
the
garbage
in
any
other
way.
you
can’t
burn
california
garbage.
you
can’t
do
anything
like
that,
because
of
the
smog
levels
out
there.
the
only
thing
you
can
do
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
a
drawl,
just
carry
it
out
to
the
curb
side.
you
can’t
leave
it
behind
your
house,
because
if
you
do,
they
won’t
pick
it
up.
you
maybe
be
able
to
do
that
in
some
of
the
small
towns
i
don’t
know,
but
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
the
only
way
you
can
get
rid
of
it
and
it’s
covered
by
these
statutes
in
my
brief,
is
to
carry
it
out
to
the
curb
side.
and,
the
california
supreme
court,
even
in
its
dissent,
in
its
three-man
dissent
in
the
krivda
case,
recognized
the
right
of
privacy
in
that
can
when
it
was
on
the
back
step
of
the
home.
but,
somehow
and
i
contend
this
is
an
intellectual
non
sequitur,
they
seem
to
lose
three
votes
when
it
was
carried
out
to
the
curb,
and
i
don’t
understand
that
because
this
is
what
people
have
to
do.
if
you
did
not
do
that
you
would
have
the
home
being
engulfed
in
garbage
because
you
never
get
rid
of
it.
you
have
to
carry
it
out
to
the
curb
and
get
rid
of
it.
and,
they’re
doing
--
my
clients
were
doing
only
what
they
had
to
do
in
order
to
get
rid
of
this.
we
have
a
very
regulated
situation
in
california,
and
i
don’t
think
that
these
people
can
be
held
to
have
given
up
any
right
of
privacy
simply
because
they
had
to
carry
this
can
out
to
the
curb
side
in
order
to
get
rid
of
it.
and
so
therefore
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
distinguishment
between
the
edwards
case
and
the
krivda
case
in
the
state
of
california.
now,
i
think
also
of
great
importance
is
the
following:
is
there
a
possibility
of
detecting
contraband
under
these
circumstances.
i
defend
in
california
a
lot
of
drug
cases.
i
have
never
seen,
never
seen
at
all
even
licensed
chemist
who
are
able
to
detect
contraband
without
doing
analysis
and
i’m
talking
here
about
marijuana
and
pills
and
so
forth.
you
can’t
tell
the
majority
of
white
pills
are
morphine
tablets.
so
therefore
you
have
a
university
trained
chemist
who
has
to
make
quite
extensive
test
to
detect
contraband
and
therefore
i
would
contend
that
the
average
person
who
would
have
a
split
second
chance
to
view
contraband
in
the
well
of
this
garbage
truck
would
have
no
chance,
no
chance
at
all
to
detect
it
whatsoever.
he
could
not
possibly
detect
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
it
goes
to
a
landfill
mr.
justice
powell,
where
it’s
plowed
over
by
bulldozers
to
make
landfill
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
all
the
time,
they’re
out
there
all
the
time.
when
those
trucks
bring
it
out
they
are
constantly
out
there,
weaving
back
and
forth
on
the
land
and
disposing
of
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
in
general,
well,
there
maybe,
yes,
there
maybe,
but
that’s
in
this
movie
also.
i’d
like
to
have
the
court
take
a
look
at
it.
this
is
an
unrehearsed
movie
of
the
california
dumps,
showing
where
this,
what
happens
in
this
stuff?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no
they
didn’t,
i
have
made
this
movie
two
weeks
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
nobody
had
seen
it.
but
i
again
offer
to
this
court
for
the
realization
as
to
what
takes
place
in
california
garbage
dumps.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
don’t.
i
equate
this
to
a
requirement
as
to
how
you
have
to
dispose
of
something,
it’s
not
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
under
the
general
idea
of
abandonment
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
abandonment
would
be
just
some
free
will,
free
desire
to
get
rid
of
something.
here,
you
have
a
very
regulated
way
that
you
have
to
do
it.
you’re
disposing
of
something
pursuant
to
statute,
pursuant
to
statute.
you
can’t
do
it
any
other
way
in
california,
unless
you
want
to
get
into
the
business
yourself
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes,
i
think
you
could
flush
that
down
the
toilet
or
some
people
do
who
are
kind
of
hard
press
for
it,
they’ll
roll
it
over
again
in
a
new
cigarette,
i
think
you
could
do
that.
but,
i
don’t
know,
i
had
never
fooled
with
it
myself,
other
than
represent
these
people
but
i
am
told
that
they
will
recycle
their
marijuana
into
new
cigarettes
when
it
gets
down
to
the
end.
now,
one
thing
i
think
that
we
got
to
distinguish
here
is
--
i
am
sure
the
state
of
california
is
probably
not
suggesting
widespread
indiscriminate
searching
of
garbage
cans.
if
they
are,
i
would
contend,
as
i
have
in
my
brief,
if
this
is
a
mathematical
impossibility.
it’s
a
statistic
impossibility
that
there
is
just
no
possibility
that
this
is
going
to
be
successful
when
you
talk
about
the
number
of
police
that
can
be
devoted
to
it
versus
number
of
garbage
cans.
so
therefore,
we
have
to
talk
about
a
situation
where
there’s
some
type
of
information,
some
type
of
premonition
that
a
can
contains
contraband
and
in
those
particular
circumstances,
i
contend
that
the
search
warrant
is
a
preferred
way,
aguilar
versus
texas,
spinelli
versus
united
states,
whiteley
versus
warden
of
wyoming
state
prison,
and
all
the
various
decisions
of
this
court
which
actually
require
--
and
i
suggest
also
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire.
as
i
read
coolidge
in
the
91
supreme
court
addition
2022
at
page
2047,
this
court
has
restricted
the
particular
ways
of
seizing
things
anymore
to
either
a
search
warrant
or
its
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
and
so,
instead
of
trying
to
muddy
up
the
waters,
instead
of
trying
to
complicate
the
deal
with
search
and
seizure,
this
court
has
simplified
it
by
curtailing
the
means
by
which
somebody
can
seize
something.
so,
i
think
there’s
just
a
host
of
decisions
going
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
going
to
the
law
of
california,
going
to
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court,
invoking
article
1
section
19
in
the
edwards
case
and
incorporating
that
to
krivda
case
would
just
absolutely
preclude
this
type
of
thing
from
happening.
and
i
think
the
decision
of
this
court
should
be
nine
to
nothing
affirming
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
this
particular
case.
i
just
can’t
see
how
it
can
be
anything
else
under
the
various
things
that
have
happened
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
you
mean
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
dismiss
it
for
want
to
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
that
maybe
true.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
indiana
toll
road.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
right,
right.
now,
i
think
there’s
one
other
area
i
want
to
touch
on
in
the
closing
minutes
here.
i
think
there’s
a
very
pragmatic
situation
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
that
if
this
court
would
at
all
sanction
a
search
of
garbage
cans,
it
is
an
avenue,
if
you
open
up
numerous
areas
of
fraud,
because
a
garbage
can
as
this
court
i
think
is
almost
a
judicial
notice
can
be
loaded
by
somebody
who
wants
to
get
rid
of
somebody
else.
if
i
want
to
get
rid
of
my
neighbor,
i’ll
go
and
deposit
marijuana
in
the
can,
i
make
an
anonymous
phone
call
to
the
police
department,
i
say,
“mr.
jones
at
123
main
street
has
marijuana
in
the
garbage
can,”
zoom!
they
come
over,
they
descend
on
the
can,
they
search
it,
they
find
marijuana
and
he
is
off
to
the
poky.
and
if
you
don’t
think
it’s
difficult
to
defend
these
drug
cases
in
california,
well
you
got
another
thing
that
coming,
because
i
did
--
do
it
all
day
and
it’s
very
emotionally
laden
and
it’s
very
difficult
to
get
these
people
off,
if
they’re
caught
in
anyway
with
narcotics
before
a
jury.
they
think
that
they’re
guilty,
there’s
no
way
you
can
do
it,
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
court
any
way
gives
any
credence
to
the
desire
to
the
california
attorney
general,
we
have
some
problems,
we
have
some
severe
problems
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
also,
i
think
also
we
have
the
final
threshold
question
as
to
the
right
of
privacy
of
people
to
live
their
lives,
to
dispose
of
their
life’s
tracings
if
might
be
birth
control,
residue,
or
if
it
might
be
a
particular
liquor
that
they
want
to
use
or
something
i
think
that
it
is
a
severe
encroachment
upon
the
right
of
privacy,
if
this
court
would
in
any
way
suggest
that
the
california
police
should
be
given
the
right
to
indiscriminately
search
these
cans.
citing
griswold
versus
connecticut,
i
think
that
the
birth
control
privacy,
the
bedroom
should
be
extended
to
the
--
getting
rid
of
that
birth
control
material
out
into
the
garbage
can.
and,
also
i
think
there
is
a
severe
equal
protection
problem,
because
if
this
whole
matter
depends
on
where
that
can
might
be
setting
or
whether
you
might
be
living
in
a
rural
area,
residential
area,
i
think
that
--
i
think
it’s
a
refinement
that
we
don’t
want
to
go
into.
many
people
live
in
huge
apartment
houses
where
there
is
a
commingling
in
the
--
in
a
huge
trashcan.
there
you
don’t
have
the
problem,
because
it’s
initially
commingled,
but
if
you
don’t
have
the
situation
where
you’re
living
under
circumstances
like
that
or
you’re
living
in
a
private
home,
of
course,
then
you
have
to
comply
with
the
regulations
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
and
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
how
you
get
rid
of
these
materials.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
certainly
it
does,
i
recognize
this,
i
recognize
this.
now,
no
one
has
said
in
argument
yet
about
the
general
attack
on
matt
versus
ohio,
but
in
the
couple
of
minutes
i
have
left,
assuming
my
opponent
is
going
to
allude
to
it
in
his
closing
arguments.
i
think
that
somebody
of
my
particular
educational
status
is
not
going
to,
in
the
few
minutes,
in
any
way,
attempt
to
overcome
the
scholars
of
the
last
50
years
who
have
considered,
debated,
discussed,
published
law
review
article
by
the
thousands
on
the
exclusionary
rule,
i
think
that
the
state
of
california
is
now
in
a
position
where
frankly
there’s
been
an
addition
of
four
new
members
to
this
court
and
the
--
i
think
they
feel
that
they
can
take
a
new
shot
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
this
court
should
not
likely
consider
in
a
solemnest
rule.
there
is
really
no
other
practical
way,
no
other
practical
way.
some
people
may
say,
pursue
of
42
u.s.c.
1983
civil
right
suit,
but
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
if
somebody
is
caught
with
a
bunch
of
cocaine
and
it
is
shown
to
be
an
illegal
seizure,
but
because
you
can’t
exclude
it,
the
man
is
convicted,
he
does
maybe
ten
years,
he
makes
$50,000
a
year
of
selling
cocaine,
he
brings
a
civil
rights
suit
to
recover
$50,000
times
ten
years,
or
$500,000.
what
jury
in
the
united
states
would
give
him
ten
cents,
a
man
who
is
dealing
in
cocaine,
brings
a
civil
right
suit
to
recover
money,
because
he
had
been
illegally
searched
and
seized,
can
anybody
in
their
wildest
imagination
should
suggest
that
man
would
get
any
money?
i
don’t
think
so.
there
really
is
practically
no
relief
under
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act.
some
people
may
suggest,
well,
we
should
discipline
the
police.
i
don’t
think
this
is
practical,
i
think
this
has
been
hash
and
rehashed
for
years.
it
is
not
a
practical
way
of
handling
it.
the
only
way
it
can
be
done
is
by
the
--
this
exclusionary
rule
and
i
think
that
the
scholars
of
the
last
fifty
years,
emanating
from
weeks
versus
united
states
down
through
matt
versus
ohio
have
so
considered,
and
there
just
is
really
no
other
way
of
doing
it.
if
the
state
of
california
is
really
sincere
in
this,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
may
give
some
credence
to
a
parallel
type
of
relief,
along
with
this
exclusionary
rule,
to
see
how
it
works.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
the
bivens
versus
six
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics
expressed
the
reluctance
to
throw
away
the
exclusionary
rule
in
illinios
and
alternate
could
be
selected.
and
so,
i
think
that
if
there’s
any
credence
to
be
given
to
an
alternate
let
it
go
in
a
parallel
manner
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
let’s
all
investigate
and
see
what
happens.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
probably
still
be
in
effect,
because
the
alternates
are
merely
shams
that
they
really
will
not
work
too
well.
california
talks
about
restricting
it
to
substantial
violations,
and
i
would
suggest
that
we’re
getting
into
replete
additional
things,
which
are
going
to
be
more
complicated,
because
then
you
are
going
to
have
got
to
decide
where
there
is
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
search
where
it
has
already
been
held
to
be
somewhat
unreasonable.
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
nuisances
on
--
nuisances
on
this
particular
thing
to
the
point
where
anybody
that
would
want
it
had
to
happen
would
give
up
in
despair
on
it.
even
in
the
amicus
curia
briefs,
the
reasons
for
doing
away
with
it,
the
americans
for
effective
law
enforcement
presents
statistics
that
show
that
the
police
are
doing
so
well
with
an
84%,
6
out
of
7
cases,
the
attack
on
the
search
and
seizure
has
been
upheld
as
being
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
california
in
this
brief
says,
“well,
the
thing
is
so
complicated
our
police
can’t
understand
it.”
i
think
that
and
that
alone
is
reason
for
disinterested,
neutral
magistrate,
who
has
had
training
in
law
to
set
and
decide
if
it’s
legal
or
illegal.
illinois
says
and
i’d
hesitate
to
admit
it
that
their
police
are
lying
so
badly.
every
time
they
get
caught
and
they’re
challenged
by
a
judge,
where
they
would
be
prone
to
lying
in
order
to
get
the
evidence
in.
well,
i
would
suggest
the
state
of
illinois
is
a
different
fact,
that’s
our
admission
that
they
ought
to
try
and
curtail
their
policemen
lying
and
go
on
the
same
rule
that
everybody
else
goes,
a
judge
is
suppose
to
decide
this.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
it’s
a
pleasure
to
do
it.
