justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
iungerich,
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
sometime
during
your
argument
to
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court
of
california’s
opinion
as
to
whether
it
get
--
did
decide
the
case
on
a
federal
constitutional
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
if
you’re
going
to
--
i
was
hoping
you
would
come
to
it
sometime
during
your
argument.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
wouldn’t
a
typical
motion
to
suppress
made
by
a
defense
counsel
in
the
superior
court
in
california,
raise
both
state
federal
grounds,
if
you’re
talking
about
unreasonable
search
and
seizures?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hanson,
you
contend
i
take
it
that’s
patent
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
relied
on
the
state
ground.
your
opposing
counsel
apparently
contends
that
it’s
equally
plain
it
relied
on
the
federal
ground.
if
we
should
be
in
some
doubt,
wouldn’t
the
natural
thing
for
us
to
do
under
our
presence
be
to
remand
under
minnesota
versus
national
tea
and
that
line
of
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
we
should
conclude
there
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn’t
that
just
the
situation
that
obtained
in
kirchner
and
obtained
in
minnesota
versus
national
tea,
this
court
didn’t
question
the
fact
that
the
state
could
afford
broader
protection
than
the
federal
constitution,
but
we
felt
it
was
unclear,
whether
or
not
the
state
had
felt
compelled
by
the
federal
constitution
or
was
acting
under
it’s
own
edges.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
mr.
hanson
the
supreme
court
of
california
used
the
word
requested,
didn’t
it,
when
it
spoke
of
the
context
between
the
police
and
the
garbage
hollers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
there’s
no
difference
between
the
word
commanded
and
requested?
