mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
here
are
nonprofessional
employees
of
state
hospitals
and
of
a
state
school
in
missouri.
their
complaint
which
was
dismissed
does
not
specify
their
citizenship,
but
presumably,
they
are
also
citizens
of
missouri
and
the
suit
therefore
does
not
come
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
protections
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
were
extended
to
these
employees
in
1966
amendments
to
the
act
which
this
court
upheld
as
constitutional
in
maryland
against
wirtz.
and
they
are
seeking
here
to
sue
their
employers
in
federal
court
for
unpaid
overtime
compensation.
as
mr.
zwerdling
ably
pointed
it
out
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument
on
their
face,
the
remedial
provisions
they
invoked
under
the
act
apply
to
these
employees
and
their
employers
just
as
they
do
to
any
others
covered
by
the
act.
and
so
the
question
presented
is
whether
constitutional
considerations
nonetheless
require
that
this
category
of
employees
be
discriminated
against
by
being
denied
a
remedy
against
their
employers
provided
by
congress
and
available
to
all
others
within
the
act’s
coverage.
the
answer
in
our
view
is
to
be
found
by
putting
together
this
court’s
decision
in
maryland
against
wirtz,
with
its
prior
decision
and
parden
against
terminal
railway.
what
parden
holds
is
that
where
a
state
engages
in
activities
that
are
validly
subject
to
congressional
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause,
it
is
subject
to
that
regulation
as
fully
as
if
it
were
private
person
or
a

and
specifically
that
congress
can
in
effect
condition
the
states
continued
participation
in
the
regulated
activity
on
constructive
consent
to
be
sued
under
the
federal
regulatory
statute.
and
maryland
against
wirtz
of
course
adds
to
this
that
the
activities
involves
here
are
activities
that
are
validly
subject
to
congressional
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
seems
to
us
that
these
cases
have
developed
that
as
the
relevant
test
rather
than
the
old
distinctions
that
were
attempted
to
be
drawn
between
governmental
and
proprietary
functions
or
what
might
be
called
essential
functions
or
traditional
functions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
--
we
don’t
regard
parden
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
dissent
said
that
it
was
a
waiver.
i
don’t
think
that
word
was
used
in
their
court’s
opinion.
it
really
amounted
to
a
constructive
consent.
it’s
a
condition.
it’s
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
has
undertaken
to
regulate
the
activities
in
this
field
rather
perform
by
a
state
or
by
a
business
and
to
undertake
them
evenhandedly
it
has
notified
the
state
that
if
they
continue
to
engage
in
this
activity,
they
are
subject
to
the
same
federal
regulation
of
that
--
of
the
business
enterprises
also
engaging
in
this
activity
are
subject
to.
and
by
continuing
to
engage
in
the
activity
the
state
constructively
consents
to
be
sued.
therefore,
that’s
what
the
court
reasoned
in
parden.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor,
by
engaging
in
the
activity.
now,
indeed,
we
think
that
in
two
important
respects,
this
case
really
follows
a
fortiori
from
parden.
first,
the
fela
which
was
the
statute
at
issue
in
parden
made
no
reference
to
state-owned
railroads.
it
merely
said
that
“every
common
carrier
by
railroad
while
engaging
in
commerce”
is
liable
to
injured
employees
and
subject
to
suit
and
the
court
there
had
to
decide
whether
this
general
language
should
be
construed
to
include
state-owned
the
railroads.
a
majority
held
that
it
should
although
four
dissenting
justices
were
of
the
view
that
congress
should
speak
more
specifically
in
order
to
subject
states
to
suit
if
they
engage
in
activity
subject
to
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause
and
here
congress
has
explicitly
amended
a
series
of
definitional
provisions
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
make
the
act’s
provision
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
was
unanimously
of
the
view
in
parden
that
congress
had
the
constitutional
power
to
impose
in
effect
this
constructive
consent
under
states
activity
that
was
divided
five
to
four
on
whether
congress
had
in
fact
done
so.
so
it
was
both
the
constitutional
under
statutory
decision.
the
court
was
unanimous
on
its
constitutional
holding
but
divided
five
to
four
on
a
statutory
construction.
there
is
no
question
but
under
this
act,
the
state
has
been
put
on
noticed
which
was
the
query
raised
in
the
dissent
in
part.
it’s
been
put
on
noticed
that
the
provisions
applied
to
it
and
it
is
been
put
on
noticed
that
it
surely
a
subject
to
suit
if
it
violates
them
by
withholdings,
the
wages
that
are
due
surely
subject
to
suit
by
the
secretary
and
on
the
face
of
the
act
also
subject
to
suit
and
by
the
employees
as
well.
so,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
can
enjoin
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
the
single
wages
without
interest
and
without
consequential
damages
of
any
kind.
in
the
ordinary
suit
brought
by
the
employee
to
fully
compensate
him,
congress
has
provided
for
liquidated
damages
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
not
plus
interest,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
in
lieu
of
interest
and
in
lieu
of
consequential
damages
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
plus
attorney’s
fees,
otherwise,
many
of
these
suits
i
doubt
would
be
in
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
many
of
them
are
relatively
smart
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
those
instances
where
the
secretary
sues.
the
court
long
ago
held
that
the
liquidated
damages
provision
is
compensatory
in
nature
that
there
are
many
consequential
damages
as
suffered
by
wage
earners
in
low
pay
categories
such
as,
the
non-professional
employees
in
hospitals,
schools
and
volunteers
and
many
consequential
damages
from
withheld
wages
which
are
difficult
to
ascertain
in
lieu
of
either
interests
or
consequential
damages,
this
is
the
measure
of
compensation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
turned
over
to
the
employee
the
recovery,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
just
that
much,
just
the
amount
of
the
withheld
wages.
so
that
in
effect
the
judgment
against
the
employer
in
that
case
is
nothing
but
he
should
have
paid
all
along
and
sometime
earlier
and
he’s
had
the
use
of
the
money
in
the
31:48.
now,
there
is
another
important
respect
in
which
this
case
in
our
view
follows
a
fortiori
from
parden.
here
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
act
clearly
apply
to
the
state
of
employers
and
the
only
question
is
whether
in
the
context
of
state
employment,
this
substantive
right
should
be
separated
from
the
statutory
remedy
provided
for
employees.
in
our
view,
even
if
this
kind
of
divorce
of
rights
from
remedies
might
be
possible
in
interpreting
some
statutes,
it
is
particularly
inappropriate
with
respect
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
because
under
the
fair
labors
standards
act,
the
remedy
is
not
merely
compensatory
as
it
is
in
most
statutes
including
the
fela
which
was
involved
in
parden
but
the
remedy
itself
also
accomplishes
an
important
part
of
the
regulatory
objective
that
congress
had.
since
one
of
the
principle
purposes
of
the
act
is
to
insure
that
some
employers
do
not
gain
an
unfair
advantage
over
their
competitors
by
paying
substandard
wages,
that
is
why
this
court
has
said
that
section
16
(b)
of
the
act
involved
here
has
both
a
public
and
a
private
character
that
it
is
both
compensatory
and
an
enforcement
provision.
and
significantly,
the
senate
report
on
the
1966
amendments
specifically
said
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
extending
the
act
to
cover
this
state-run
institutions
was
to
bring
about
a
competitively
equality
with
similar
activities
carried
on
by
business
enterprises.
we
have
the
quote
on
page
17
of
our
brief
from
the
report.
they
were
attempting
to
follow
through
on
the
act’s
original
basic
purpose
of
eliminating
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
congress
--
in
commerce.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
was
the
view
congress
took.
they
are
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
concluding
that
in
many
instances
they
are
competing
with
privately
run
instances
they
are
competing
with
privately-run
enterprises
and
congress
spell
was
unfair
for
the
privately-run
enterprise
to
have
to
comply
with
the
provisions
in
the
fair
labor
standard
act
and
to
have
competing
services
made
available
by
state
institutions
at
lower
clause
to
uses
of
those
services
partly
because
low
paid
non-professional
personnel
are
being
paid
substandard
wages.
this
was
one
of
the
conclusions
congress
came
to
and
enacting
the
amendments
that
this
court
upheld
in
maryland
against
wirtz.
another
basic
purpose
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
resided
in
the
act
itself
was
to
avoid
labor
disputes
that
interfere
with
the
commerce.
congress
wanted
to
take
these
controversies
about
substandard
wages
and
overtime
compensation
out
of
the
streets
and
into
the
courts.
yet
what
could
be
more
calculated
to
lead
to
labors
strife
than
a
holding
that
employees
whose
federal
statutory
rights
have
been
violated
are
to
be
denied
a
judicial
remedy.
so
in
this
respect
too,
the
remedy
here
is
an
integral
part
of
the
regulatory
objective.
but
it
is
not
merely
compensatory
and
not
merely
designed
to
encourage
compliance
with
the
act
as
our
most
remedies
in
statutes.
of
course,
it
also
does
encourage
compliance
and
thereby
furthers
the
act’s
other
objectives
such
as
reducing
unemployment
by
encouraging
employers
to
hire
more
people
rather
than
to
work
their
employees
at
overtime.
this
is
one
of
the
basic
objectives
of
the
act
and
except
continuing
importance
with
our
persistent
unemployment.
now,
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
also
empowered
to
bring
enforcement
suits
here
which
will
not
fully
compensate
the
employees
does
not
in
our
view
call
for
a
different
result
than
in
parden
because
of
the
vast
numbers
of
employees
and
establishments
covered
by
the
act.
the
secretary
is
unable
to
bring
suits
except
in
the
small
proportion
of
the
cases
in
which
violations
occur.
indeed,
the
secretary
is
not
staffed
even
to
be
able
to
investigate.
all
possible
violations
let
alone
to
bring
suit
against
all
the
violations
that
occur
and
of
necessity
the
secretary’s
limited
staff
of
15
attorneys
and
13
regional
offices
must
concentrate
their
efforts
on
cases
that
involved
the
greatest
public
interest.
from
the
beginning,
congress
decided
to
provide
a
private
remedy
in
the
act
rather
than
to
create
the
best
federal
bureaucracy
that
would
otherwise
be
required
if
enforcement
were
to
be
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
the
covered
employees
to
2.7
million
of
them
are
in
these
covered
state
institutions
and
this
involves
118,000
such
institutions,
so
it’s
a
substantial
part.
all
together
we’re
talking
about
2
million
establishments
and
45
million
employees
but
it
is
still
a
very
substantial
figure
and
the
problem
would
be
very
much
exacerbated
mr.
justice
by
the
same
issue
which
arises
under
1972
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
extend
coverage
of
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
regardless
of
sex
provisions
to
professional
employees
in
this
covered
institutions
including
the
state
institutions.
those
are
cases
that
tend
to
involve
special
facts
that
have
to
be
developed
with
regard
to
the
particular
individuals
covered
and
to
whether
their
work
is
comparable
to
somebody
else’s
work.
they’re
quite
time-consuming
lawsuits
and
in
many
instances
of
employees
denied
compensation.
you
have
time-consuming
factual
problems
to
be
developed
in
the
suits.
there’s
little
doubt
to
what
the
secretary
could
not
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
all
who
would
be
entitled
to
recovery
and
the
secretary
would
then
be
in
a
very
awkward
position
and
his
refusal
to
bring
suit
that
would
constitute
a
final
denial
of
a
remedy
in
particular
cases.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
secretary
that
kind
of
essentially
unreviewable
authority
over
the
rights
of
individuals
protected
by
this
act.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief

and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
here

the

extended

in

against

the
commerce
clause
and
here
congress
has
explicitly
amended
a
series
of
definitional
provisions
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
make
the
act’s
provision
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
was
unanimously
of
the
view
in
parden
that
congress
had
the
constitutional
power
to
impose
in
effect
this
constructive
consent
under
states
activity
that
was
divided
five
to
four
on
whether
congress
had
in
fact
done
so.
so
it
was
both
the
constitutional
under
statutory
decision.
the
court
was
unanimous
on
its
constitutional
holding
but
divided
five
to
four
on
a
statutory
construction.
there
is
no
question
but
under
this
act,
the
state
has
been
put
on
noticed
which
was
the
query
raised
in
the
dissent
in
part.
it’s
been
put
on
noticed
that
the
provisions
applied
to
it
and
it
is
been
put
on
noticed
that
it
surely
a
subject
to
suit
if
it
violates
them
by
withholdings,
the
wages
that
are
due
surely
subject
to
suit
by
the
secretary
and
on
the
face
of
the
act
also
subject
to
suit
and
by
the
employees
as
well.
so,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
can
enjoin
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
the
single
wages
without
interest
and
without
consequential
damages
of
any
kind.
in
the
ordinary
suit
brought
by
the
employee
to
fully
compensate
him,
congress
has
provided
for
liquidated
damages
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
not
plus
interest,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
in
lieu
of
interest
and
in
lieu
of
consequential
damages
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
plus
attorney’s
fees,
otherwise,
many
of
these
suits
i
doubt
would
be
in
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
many
of
them
are
relatively
smart
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
those
instances
where
the
secretary
sues.
the
court
long
ago
held
that
the
liquidated
damages
provision
is
compensatory
in
nature
that
there
are
many
consequential
damages
as
suffered
by
wage
earners
in
low
pay
categories
such
as,
the
non-professional
employees
in
hospitals,
schools
and
volunteers
and
many
consequential
damages
from
withheld
wages
which
are
difficult
to
ascertain
in
lieu
of
either
interests
or
consequential
damages,
this
is
the
measure
of
compensation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
turned
over
to
the
employee
the
recovery,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
just
that
much,
just
the
amount
of
the
withheld
wages.
so
that
in
effect
the
judgment
against
the
employer
in
that
case
is
nothing
but
he
should
have
paid
all
along
and
sometime
earlier
and
he’s
had
the
use
of
the
money
in
the
31:48.
now,
there
is
another
important
respect
in
which
this
case
in
our
view
follows
a
fortiori
from
parden.
here
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
act
clearly
apply
to
the
state
of
employers
and
the
only
question
is
whether
in
the
context
of
state
employment,
this
substantive
right
should
be
separated
from
the
statutory
remedy
provided
for
employees.
in
our
view,
even
if
this
kind
of
divorce
of
rights
from
remedies
might
be
possible
in
interpreting
some
statutes,
it
is
particularly
inappropriate
with
respect
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
because
under
the
fair
labors
standards
act,
the
remedy
is
not
merely
compensatory
as
it
is
in
most
statutes
including
the
fela
which
was
involved
in
parden
but
the
remedy
itself
also
accomplishes
an
important
part
of
the
regulatory
objective
that
congress
had.
since
one
of
the
principle
purposes
of
the
act
is
to
insure
that
some
employers
do
not
gain
an
unfair
advantage
over
their
competitors
by
paying
substandard
wages,
that
is
why
this
court
has
said
that
section
16
(b)
of
the
act
involved
here
has
both
a
public
and
a
private
character
that
it
is
both
compensatory
and
an
enforcement
provision.
and
significantly,
the
senate
report
on
the
1966
amendments
specifically
said
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
extending
the
act
to
cover
this
state-run
institutions
was
to
bring
about
a
competitively
equality
with
similar
activities
carried
on
by
business
enterprises.
we
have
the
quote
on
page
17
of
our
brief
from
the
report.
they
were
attempting
to
follow
through
on
the
act’s
original
basic
purpose
of
eliminating
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
congress
--
in
commerce.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
was
the
view
congress
took.
they
are
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
concluding
that
in
many
instances
they
are
competing
with
privately
run
instances
they
are
competing
with
privately-run
enterprises
and
congress
spell
was
unfair
for
the
privately-run
enterprise
to
have
to
comply
with
the
provisions
in
the
fair
labor
standard
act
and
to
have
competing
services
made
available
by
state
institutions
at
lower
clause
to
uses
of
those
services
partly
because
low
paid
non-professional
personnel
are
being
paid
substandard
wages.
this
was
one
of
the
conclusions
congress
came
to
and
enacting
the
amendments
that
this
court
upheld
in
maryland
against
wirtz.
another
basic
purpose
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
resided
in
the
act
itself
was
to
avoid
labor
disputes
that
interfere
with
the
commerce.
congress
wanted
to
take
these
controversies
about
substandard
wages
and
overtime
compensation
out
of
the
streets
and
into
the
courts.
yet
what
could
be
more
calculated
to
lead
to
labors
strife
than
a
holding
that
employees
whose
federal
statutory
rights
have
been
violated
are
to
be
denied
a
judicial
remedy.
so
in
this
respect
too,
the
remedy
here
is
an
integral
part
of
the
regulatory
objective.
but
it
is
not
merely
compensatory
and
not
merely
designed
to
encourage
compliance
with
the
act
as
our
most
remedies
in
statutes.
of
course,
it
also
does
encourage
compliance
and
thereby
furthers
the
act’s
other
objectives
such
as
reducing
unemployment
by
encouraging
employers
to
hire
more
people
rather
than
to
work
their
employees
at
overtime.
this
is
one
of
the
basic
objectives
of
the
act
and
except
continuing
importance
with
our
persistent
unemployment.
now,
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
also
empowered
to
bring
enforcement
suits
here
which
will
not
fully
compensate
the
employees
does
not
in
our
view
call
for
a
different
result
than
in
parden
because
of
the
vast
numbers
of
employees
and
establishments
covered
by
the
act.
the
secretary
is
unable
to
bring
suits
except
in
the
small
proportion
of
the
cases
in
which
violations
occur.
indeed,
the
secretary
is
not
staffed
even
to
be
able
to
investigate.
all
possible
violations
let
alone
to
bring
suit
against
all
the
violations
that
occur
and
of
necessity
the
secretary’s
limited
staff
of
15
attorneys
and
13
regional
offices
must
concentrate
their
efforts
on
cases
that
involved
the
greatest
public
interest.
from
the
beginning,
congress
decided
to
provide
a
private
remedy
in
the
act
rather
than
to
create
the
best
federal
bureaucracy
that
would
otherwise
be
required
if
enforcement
were
to
be
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
the
covered
employees
to
2.7
million
of
them
are
in
these
covered
state
institutions
and
this
involves
118,000
such
institutions,
so
it’s
a
substantial
part.
all
together
we’re
talking
about
2
million
establishments
and
45
million
employees
but
it
is
still
a
very
substantial
figure
and
the
problem
would
be
very
much
exacerbated
mr.
justice
by
the
same
issue
which
arises
under
1972
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
extend
coverage
of
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
regardless
of
sex
provisions
to
professional
employees
in
this
covered
institutions
including
the
state
institutions.
those
are
cases
that
tend
to
involve
special
facts
that
have
to
be
developed
with
regard
to
the
particular
individuals
covered
and
to
whether
their
work
is
comparable
to
somebody
else’s
work.
they’re
quite
time-consuming
lawsuits
and
in
many
instances
of
employees
denied
compensation.
you
have
time-consuming
factual
problems
to
be
developed
in
the
suits.
there’s
little
doubt
to
what
the
secretary
could
not
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
all
who
would
be
entitled
to
recovery
and
the
secretary
would
then
be
in
a
very
awkward
position
and
his
refusal
to
bring
suit
that
would
constitute
a
final
denial
of
a
remedy
in
particular
cases.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
secretary
that
kind
of
essentially
unreviewable
authority
over
the
rights
of
individuals
protected
by
this
act.
thank
you.
