mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
certiorari
from
a
five-four
decision
of
eighth
circuit
granting
motion
to
dismiss
a
complaint
filed
by
employees
of
the
state
of
missouri.
they
sue
for
time-and-a-half
overtime
pay
and
additional
equal
amount
as
liquidated
damages
and
reasonable
counsel
fees
as
provided
for
in
a
fair
labor
standards
act
known
as
the
wage-hour
law.
that
act
was
amended
in
1966
to
apply
to
such
state
employees.
complaint
was
filed
on
federal
district
court
in
1969,
alleging
violation
of
the
overtime
provisions
commencing
in
1967
on
february
of
that
year
and
continuing
thereafter.
in
1966,
amendments
to
the
act
under
which
these
employees
of
state
schools
and
hospital
sue
was
held
to
a
proper
exercise
of
the
congressional
power
under
commerce
clause
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
by
this
court.
and
the
case
today
presents
the
question
which
was
expressly
reserved
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
as
unnecessary
to
decision
there
of
whether
employees
may
sue
in
federal
court
to
enforce
rights
given
them
by
1966
amendments.
we
submit
that
congress
intended
to
permit
such
employee
suits
against
the
states
for
violation
of
the
act
and
that
congress
have
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
so
provide
not
withstanding
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
congressional
intent
is
clear.
statute
in
16
(b)
of
that
act
provides
and
i
quote
“any
employer
--
any
employer
who
violates
the
provisions
of
section
6
or
section
7,
those
are
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
pay
provisions.
any
employer
who
so
violates
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
a
liable
to
the
employees
affected
in
the
amount
of
their
unpaid
minimum
wages
or
their
unpaid
overtime
compensation
as
the
case
may
be,
and
then
in
additional
equal
amount
as
liquidated
damages.
actions
to
recover
such
liability
may
be
maintained
at
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
in
section
(b),
the
language
of
states.
now
the
term
“employer”
which
is
used
in
that
section
as
defined
in
section
3
of
the
act
and
what
those
amendments
in
1966
did
was
to
expand
this
definition
to
bring
under
the
statute
as
employers
within
the
meaning
of
that
section,
the
states
and
their
political
subdivisions
with
the
respect
to
certain
institutions,
schools,
and
hospitals.
prior
to
that
year
of
the
amendments,
the
section
said
employer
shall
not
include
the
united
states
or
any
state
or
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
but
when
they
added
the
amendatory
language,
congress
specifically
injected
a
removal
of
that
exclusion
of
the
states
from
the
definition
by
inserting
the
language
in
1966,
“except
with
respect
to
employees
of
a
state
or
political
subdivision
thereof,
employed
in
a
hospital,
institution,
or
school
referred
to
in
a
last
sentence
of
subsection
(r)
of
this
section.
and
so
congress
chose
explicitly
to
remove
this
previously
excluded
category
and
the
subsection
to
which
it
reversed
in
this
definition
is
the
definition
of
the
word
“enterprise.”
here,
congress
added
to
the
list
of
covered
enterprises,
the
operation
of
a
hospital,
institution,
or
school,
and
once
again
on
those
amendments,
congress
underlined
its
expressed
intention
by
adding
these
words,
“regardless
of
whether
or
not
such
hospital,
institution,
or
school
is
public
or
private
or
operated
for
profit
or
not
for
profit.”
nothing
could
be
clear
or
more
explicit
and
again,
in
the
next
subsection
which
speaks
of
the
definition
of
“enterprise
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.”
congress
added
the
same
language
once
again
stressing,
“regardless
of
whether
or
not
such
hospital,
institution,
or
school
is
public
or
private.”
the
remedy
of
the
employee’s
suit
in
section
16
(b)
has
existed
in
the
statute
since
it
was
enacted
in
1938.
it
reaches
the
states
here
because
it
says,
“any
employer
who
violate
this
sections
will
be
subject
to
such
suits.”
and
by
expanding
that
definition
of
employer
thus
this
remedy
comes
into
play.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
that
is
explicit
in
section
16
(b)
it
says,
“and
in
an
additional
equal
amount
as
liquidated
damages.”
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
there
is
some
discretion,
your
honor.
but
the
purpose
of
the
liquidated
damages
is
it
is
instead
of
interest
rates
for
purposes
of
certainty
in
setting
the
language
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
there
is
discretion
in
the
courts
to
reduce
at
other
some
circumstances,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
your
honor
and
cause
of
the
action.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
and
i
understand
that
there
is
discretion
and
the
specific
section
is
section
60
that
is
its
260
of
29
u.s.
code.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
that’s
--
that
section
is
not
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
in
the
brief
in
the
court
below,
there
is
citation
of
that
section
on
page
11
(a)
of
the
white
document
which
is
a
petition
for
certiorari,
your
honor
which
says,
quoting
the
court,
“under
the
section
260
remission
of
liquidated
damages
in
whole
or
in
part
is
only
allowable,”
quoting
the
statute
now,
“if
the
employer
shows
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
the
act
or
omission
giving
raise
to
such
action
was
in
good
faith
and
that
he
had
reasonable
ground
for
believing
that
his
act
or
omission
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standard
act
that
was
amended”.
the
court
goes
on
and
even
if
they
required
showing
is
made,
the
remission
is
left
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
no,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
had
exerted
its
jurisdiction
through
exercise
the
commerce
clause,
your
honor?
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
i
believe
there
would
be
the
discretion.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
and
i
misunderstood
the
question
then.
if
the
question
addresses
itself
to
whether
there
is
discretion
to
be
exercise
by
the
court
in
reviewing
whether
or
not
the
state
exercise
the
waiver,
that
is
something
that
is
dealt
with
as
i
would
point
out
--
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief
in
the
decision
of
a
court
in
which
it’s
made
clear
that
that
waiver
occurs
by
virtue
of
continuing
to
operate
and
that
that
waiver
need
be
neither
knowing
nor
intelligent
to
use
the
citation
by
the
dissent
in
that
case
of
what
the
court
held.
in
the
case
to
which
we
refer
in
the
parden
case
which
is
the
case
which
is
key
to
the
problem
before
us,
in
that
case,
which
was
parden
versus
alabama
terminal
railroad.
that
was
the
case
that
was
decided
in
1964
in
which
the
court
had
before
it
that
federal
employers’
liability
act
and
in
that
case
as
here,
there
was
the
question
of
private
employees
suit
to
enforce
the
rights
under
that
statute.
and
there
the
court
held
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
commerce
power
as
was
the
case
here
and
the
exercise
by
congress
of
its
commerce
power
here
in
dealing
with
the
federal
--
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
the
parden
case
which
involved
the
federal
employers’
liability
act
which
is
the
act
under
which
employees
can
sue
for
redress,
for
damage
to
the
employee
and
injury
on
the
railroad.
in
that
case,
involving
a
railroad
which
was
a
state
owned
railroad
at
the
docks
of
alabama.
the
court
held
that
commerce
clause
enabled
congress
to
act
in
this
manner
to
provide
that
private
employee
remedy
that’s
lawsuit
as
a
means
of
remedy
and
the
court
held
that
this
occurred
by
virtue
of
the
continuing
operation
of
that
railroad.
the
same
principal
applying
here
and
has
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
as
to
whether
it’s
usually
engage
in,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
a
distinction
that
the
courts
have
held
to
make
the
constitutional
difference.
that
discussion
has
occurred
by
this
court
in
two
cases
involving
the
state
of
california
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief.
and
in
the
parden
case
and
numerous
other
cases
in
which
the
question
--
i
think
your
honor
is
alluding
to
the
concept
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
well,
it’s
a
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
as
here,
the
state
of
missouri
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
the
case
of
maryland
versus
wirtz
in
which
the
validity
of
the
wage-hour
law
amendments
here
before
the
court
was
dealt
with
expressly
as
to
their
constitutionality
in
that
case
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
well,
i
think
your
honor
is
alluding
to
what
we
are
familiar
with
as
the
ancient
argument
as
to
proprietary
versus
governmental
powers
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
i
presume
that
the
state
doesn’t
have
much
choice
as
to
whether
it
is
going
to
run
a
mental
hospital.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
when
congress
enacts
this
kind
of
statute
under
the
commerce
power
which
is
plenary
unlike
the
federal
taxing
power,
commerce
can
lay
down
under
the
commerce
power,
the
conditions
or
operation
in
reference
to
anything
that
affects
commerce
and
that
is
what
congress
did
in
this
case.
that
is
what
was
upheld
in
maryland
versus
wirtz.
that
is
what
was
dealt
with
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
which
involved
the
very
state
which
is
before
us
here
today
among
other
states,
the
state
of
missouri.
and
the
state
of
missouri
was
unnoticed
when
that
decision
was
handed
down
in
1968,
that
commerce
and
the
exercise
of
its
plenary
power
under
the
commerce
clause
had
determined
that
the
problem
of
labor
disputes,
the
problem
of
maintaining
of
eliminating
unfair
competition
between
the
states
and
the
effects
on
commerce
was
best
dealt
with
by
that
enactment
in
its
wisdom
and
it’s
so
acted
and
the
court
so
upheld
the
action
of
congress
in
maryland
versus
wirtz.
as
i
say,
that
case
involved
not
only
the
state
of
maryland,
but
the
state
of
missouri,
they
were
a
party
to
it.
it
was
ruled
upon.
they
continue
to
operate
thereafter.
they
were
on
full
knowledge
of
the
situation.
but
as
the
majority
held
in
the
parden
case,
such
waiver
need
be
neither
knowing
nor
intelligent.
the
point
is
that
it
is
a
matter
of
the
plenary
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
power.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
as
to
the
distinction
between
governmental
and
proprietary,
and
if
i
may
now
allude
to
those
words
mr.
chief
justice.
maryland
versus
wirtz
said,
“in
the
first
place,
it
is
clear
the
federal
government,
when
acting
within
a
delegated
power
may
override
countervailing
state
interest
whether
this
be
described
as
governmental
or
proprietary
in
character.”
that
was
disposed
of
many
times
before.
mr.
chief
justice
frankfurter
in
the
indian
towing
case
which
involved
a
waiver
of
immunity
question
said,
“there
is
nothing
in
tort
claims
act
which
was
involved
there
which
shows
that
congress
intended
to
draw
distinctions
so
finespun
and
capricious”
to
use
the
words
of
the
court
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
to
be
almost
incapable
of
being
held
in
mind
for
adequate
formulation.
and
again,
in
the
rayonier
case,
rayonier
inc.
versus
united
states,
the
court
said,
“we
expressly
decided
in
indian
towing
that
an
injured
party
cannot
be
deprived
of
its
rights
under
the
act
by
resorting
to
an
alleged
distinction,
imported
from
the
law
of
municipal
corporations
between
the
government’s
negligence
when
it
acts
on
a
proprietary
capacity
and
its
negligence
when
it
acts
in
uniquely
governmental
capacity.”
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
sanitary
district
or
the
bottled
water
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
there
was
reference
to
that
just
as
in
contrast
in
the
sanitary
district
case
which
i
thought,
your
honor
had
in
mind.
there
was
reference
to
the
overriding
commerce
power
enabling
the
congress
to
prevent
the
state
from
taking
water
from
lake
michigan
which
was
essential
to
its
inhabitants
because
it
was
in
contravention
of
an
enactment
by
the
state
--
by
the
united
states
in
connection
with
the
commerce
power.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
that
did
not
involve
a
private
suit.
parden
which
is
the
governing
case
here
we
believe,
parden
versus
alabama
terminal
railway
did
so
involved
private
suit.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
upheld
the
specifically
ruled
on
this
very
questioned
of
the
immunity
of
the
states
from
private
suit
and
held
that
that
immunity
did
not
fasten
to
the
extent
of
precluding
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
to
enable
this
private
suit
which
has
its
purpose,
not
simply
to
help
the
individual
as
such,
but
more
importantly
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
courts
including
parden,
the
purpose
of
enforcement
of
the
statute
of
enabling
what
could
not,
otherwise
occur
by
the
government,
the
enforcement
of
this
exercise
of
commerce
power.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
it
depends,
your
honor,
on
whether
one
is
a
mental
patient
or
one
who
is
involved
in
railroad
operation.
i
don’t
need
to
be
fictitious
whether
it’s
essential
or
not
and
one
fixes
on
mental
hospitals.
this
statute
embraces
much
more
than
mental
hospitals.
it
involves
hospitals,
institutions
which
exist
in
the
private
sector
as
well
as
the
public
sector
and
it’s
function
is
as
stated
to
by
eliminating
the
differential
between
what
must
be
paid
over
40
hours
time-and-a-half,
and
what
may
much
be
paid
minimum
wage
for
a
public
employee
as
opposed
to
a
private
employee
by
eliminating
the
unfair
competition
against
private
industry
by
that
enactment.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
we
believe
it
is
totally
unnecessary
here
for
purposes
of
this
suit
to
--
of
this
case
to
challenge
the
eleventh
amendment
interpretation,
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
hans
versus
louisiana.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor?
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
by
virtue
of
the
constitution
other
than
the
eleventh
amendment,
your
honor?
mr.
a.

when
it
does
not
collide
with
the
plenary
power
of

over
the

power,
your
honor.

your
honor
--

is
right
--

l.
zwerdling
federal
support,
that’s
right.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
no
your
honor.
may
i
cite
what
mr.
justice
right
--
white
wrote
in
united
state
versus
california,
which
is
--
i’m
sorry
in
the
parden
case
in
which
statement
was
made
on
behalf
of
minority,
and
this
was
on
behalf
on
the
minority,
“i
agree
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
congress
to
condition
a
states’
permit
to
engage
in
the
interstate
transportation
business
which
is
what
was
involved
there.
on
a
waiver
of
the
state
sovereign
immunity
from
suits
arising
out
of
such
business,
congress
might
well
determine
that
allowing
regular
both
conducts
such
as
the
operation
of
a
railroad
to
be
undertaken
by
a
body
legally
immune
from
liability
directly
resulting
from
these
operations
is
so
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
each
regulation
that
the
state
must
be
put
to
the
option
of
either
forgoing
participation
in
the
conduct
or
consenting
to
a
legal
responsibility
or
injury
caused
thereby.”
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
your
honor.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
your
honor,
as
i
pointed
out.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
mr.
chief
justice,
my
approach
to
the
statutory
intent
here
was
perhaps
more
pedestrian
than
that
of
my
brother
debar.
i
went
to
the
statute
and
i
cited
very
carefully
and
explicitly
to
this
court
the
language
that
congress
injected
in
1966
by
its
amendments.
and
i
traced
carefully
the
result
by
virtue
of
that
set
of
statutory
amendments
and
nothing
could
be
more
explicit
than
the
congressional
intent
of
that.
i
will
not
yield
to
the
temptation
of
laundering
into
the
thicket
of
the
question
of
whether
the
state
courts
are
in
or
out.
i
would
merely
observe
that
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
only
that
the
state
courts
are
available
as
a
remedy,
congress
chose
to
give
the
employees
access
to
the
federal
system
to
the
federal
courts
with
all
of
the
advantages
that
flow
therefrom.
including
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
by
saying
that
in
a
definition,
in
the
amendment
of
section
3
of
the
definitions,
giving
access
to
section
16
(b)
to
these
employees
covered
by
amendments
where
it
says
in
section
16
(b)
“any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.”
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
it
is
particularly
explicit
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
since
1938
and
almost
invariably
the
suits
occur
in
federal
court.
and
congress
had
the
experience
of
all
of
the
years
since
1938
of
the
exercise
of
this
statutory
language
in
thousands
and
tens
and
thousands
of
private
employee
suits
in
federal
court
where
they
almost
been
variably
go
under
section
16
(b).
and
in
the
light
of
that
experience,
congress
and
its
amendment
of
the
definitions
chose
to
pass
on
to
the
public
employees
covered
as
it
had
in
38
private
employees
that
access.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
not
at
such,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
it
would
escape
their
attention
i
believe
it
were
--
if
it
were
not
in
question
as
it
appeared
not
to
be
in
question
since
they
enacted
this
amendments
in
1966
barely
two
years
after
this
court
handed
down
parden,
which
laid
down
the
disposition
of
this
question,
and
in
the
light
of
that
knowledge,
congress
enacted
the
amendments
of
1966.
there
are
50
states
as
this
counsel
points
out,
but
there
are
some
118,000
establishments
in
question
here
which
is
a
harsh
of
somewhat
of
different
color
in
terms
of
the
problem
of
the
secretary
of
labor
enforcement.
and
just
to
illustrate
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
complaint
here
was
filed
when?
the
compliant
was
filed
by
these
employees
in
august
of
1969
for
backpay
and
liquidated
damages
commencing
in
february
of
1967.
the
secretary
of
labor
came
in
later
in
january
of
1971,
reaching
back
only
to
january
of
1969
and
then
only
because
of
the
course
of
this
litigation
and
its
disposition.
let
me
just
conclude
by
reemphasizing
once
again
that
as
was
said
in
parden,
“by
empowering
congress
to
regulate
commerce
then,
the
states
necessarily
surrender
any
portion
of
their
sovereignty
that
would
stand
in
the
way
of
such
regulation.”
such
regulation
involves
two
parts,
two
sides
of
the
coin.
it
involves
reaching
the
substantives
matter
by
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
to
achieve
this
coverage
that
we’re
talking
about,
but
at
the
same
time,
there
goes
with
that
exercising
commerce
power
to
reach
the
remedy
which
is
the
chosen
means,
which
has
been
utilized
successfully
since
1938
which
congress
in
the
light
of
that
long
experienced
with
millions
of
situations
around
the
country
with
some
40
million
people
decided
to
extend
to
certain
limited
classes
of
state
employees
as
they
did
here.
we
believe
that
maryland
versus
wirtz
and
parden
govern
and
as
was
said
in
maryland
versus
wirtz,
i
conclude
on
this
if
i
may.
it
said
“this
court
was,
of
course,
concerned
only
with
the
finding
of
a
substantially
effect
on
interstate
competition
and
not
where
the
consequent
policy
decisions.”
quoting
another
case,
katz
and
buck,
this
court
said,
“where
we
find
that
the
legislatures
have
a
rational
basis
for
finding
a
chosen
regulatory
scheme
necessary
to
the
protection
of
commerce,
our
investigation
isn’t
at
an
end.”
may
i
submit
that
in
parden
when
that
case
was
concluded
the
court
had
already
determined
as
to
this
situation
that
that
case
--
that
this
investigation
is
at
an
end.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
mr.
chief
justice,
that
argument
is
better
than
mine.
it
is
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
federal
jurisdiction,
the
availability
of
liberal
discovery
which
is
very
important
to
employees
in
these
suits,
the
uniformity
that
you
point
out,
the
fact
that
there
is
more
expertise
in
interpreting
federal
laws,
all
of
the
panoply
of
reasons,
which
would
cause
congress
to
be
moved
to
make
this
remedy
available
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
if
there
are
not
further
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
certiorari
from
a
five-four
decision
of
eighth
circuit
granting
motion
to
dismiss
a
complaint
filed
by
employees
of
the
state
of
missouri.
they
sue
for
time-and-a-half
overtime
pay
and
additional
equal
amount
as
liquidated
damages
and
reasonable
counsel
fees
as
provided
for
in
a
fair
labor
standards
act
known
as
the
wage-hour
law.
that
act
was
amended
in
1966
to
apply
to
such
state
employees.
complaint
was
filed
on
federal
district
court
in
1969,
alleging
violation
of
the
overtime
provisions
commencing
in
1967
on
february
of
that
year
and
continuing
thereafter.
in
1966,
amendments
to
the
act
under
which
these
employees
of
state
schools
and
hospital
sue
was
held
to
a
proper
exercise
of
the
congressional
power
under
commerce
clause
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
by
this
court.
and
the
case
today
presents
the
question
which
was
expressly
reserved
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
as
unnecessary
to
decision
there
of
whether
employees
may
sue
in
federal
court
to
enforce
rights
given
them
by
1966
amendments.
we
submit
that
congress
intended
to
permit
such
employee
suits
against
the
states
for
violation
of
the
act
and
that
congress
have
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
so
provide
not
withstanding
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
congressional
intent
is
clear.
statute
in
16
(b)
of
that
act
provides
and
i
quote
“any
employer
--
any
employer
who
violates
the
provisions
of
section
6
or
section
7,
those
are
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
pay
provisions.
any
employer
who
so
violates
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
a
liable
to
the
employees
affected
in
the
amount
of
their
unpaid
minimum
wages
or
their
unpaid
overtime
compensation
as
the
case
may
be,
and
then
in
additional
equal
amount
as
liquidated
damages.
actions
to
recover
such
liability
may
be
maintained
at
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
in
section
(b),
the
language
of
states.
now
the
term
“employer”
which
is
used
in
that
section
as
defined
in
section
3
of
the
act
and
what
those
amendments
in
1966
did
was
to
expand
this
definition
to
bring
under
the
statute
as
employers
within
the
meaning
of
that
section,
the
states
and
their
political
subdivisions
with
the
respect
to
certain
institutions,
schools,
and
hospitals.
prior
to
that
year
of
the
amendments,
the
section
said
employer
shall
not
include
the
united
states
or
any
state
or
political
subdivision
of
a
state.
but
when
they
added
the
amendatory
language,
congress
specifically
injected
a
removal
of
that
exclusion
of
the
states
from
the
definition
by
inserting
the
language
in
1966,
“except
with
respect
to
employees
of
a
state
or
political
subdivision
thereof,
employed
in
a
hospital,
institution,
or
school
referred
to
in
a
last
sentence
of
subsection
(r)
of
this
section.
and
so
congress
chose
explicitly
to
remove
this
previously
excluded
category
and
the
subsection
to
which
it
reversed
in
this
definition
is
the
definition
of
the
word
“enterprise.”
here,
congress
added
to
the
list
of
covered
enterprises,
the
operation
of
a
hospital,
institution,
or
school,
and
once
again
on
those
amendments,
congress
underlined
its
expressed
intention
by
adding
these
words,
“regardless
of
whether
or
not
such
hospital,
institution,
or
school
is
public
or
private
or
operated
for
profit
or
not
for
profit.”
nothing
could
be
clear
or
more
explicit
and
again,
in
the
next
subsection
which
speaks
of
the
definition
of
“enterprise
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.”
congress
added
the
same
language
once
again
stressing,
“regardless
of
whether
or
not
such
hospital,
institution,
or
school
is
public
or
private.”
the
remedy
of
the
employee’s
suit
in
section
16
(b)
has
existed
in
the
statute
since
it
was
enacted
in
1938.
it
reaches
the
states
here
because
it
says,
“any
employer
who
violate
this
sections
will
be
subject
to
such
suits.”
and
by
expanding
that
definition
of
employer
thus
this
remedy
comes
into
play.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
that
is
explicit
in
section
16
(b)
it
says,
“and
in
an
additional
equal
amount
as
liquidated
damages.”
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
there
is
some
discretion,
your
honor.
but
the
purpose
of
the
liquidated
damages
is
it
is
instead
of
interest
rates
for
purposes
of
certainty
in
setting
the
language
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
there
is
discretion
in
the
courts
to
reduce
at
other
some
circumstances,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
your
honor
and
cause
of
the
action.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
and
i
understand
that
there
is
discretion
and
the
specific
section
is
section
60
that
is
its
260
of
29
u.s.
code.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
that’s
--
that
section
is
not
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
in
the
brief
in
the
court
below,
there
is
citation
of
that
section
on
page
11
(a)
of
the
white
document
which
is
a
petition
for
certiorari,
your
honor
which
says,
quoting
the
court,
“under
the
section
260
remission
of
liquidated
damages
in
whole
or
in
part
is
only
allowable,”
quoting
the
statute
now,
“if
the
employer
shows
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
the
act
or
omission
giving
raise
to
such
action
was
in
good
faith
and
that
he
had
reasonable
ground
for
believing
that
his
act
or
omission
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standard
act
that
was
amended”.
the
court
goes
on
and
even
if
they
required
showing
is
made,
the
remission
is
left
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
no,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
had
exerted
its
jurisdiction
through
exercise
the
commerce
clause,
your
honor?
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
i
believe
there
would
be
the
discretion.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
and
i
misunderstood
the
question
then.
if
the
question
addresses
itself
to
whether
there
is
discretion
to
be
exercise
by
the
court
in
reviewing
whether
or
not
the
state
exercise
the
waiver,
that
is
something
that
is
dealt
with
as
i
would
point
out
--
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief
in
the
decision
of
a
court
in
which
it’s
made
clear
that
that
waiver
occurs
by
virtue
of
continuing
to
operate
and
that
that
waiver
need
be
neither
knowing
nor
intelligent
to
use
the
citation
by
the
dissent
in
that
case
of
what
the
court
held.
in
the
case
to
which
we
refer
in
the
parden
case
which
is
the
case
which
is
key
to
the
problem
before
us,
in
that
case,
which
was
parden
versus
alabama
terminal
railroad.
that
was
the
case
that
was
decided
in
1964
in
which
the
court
had
before
it
that
federal
employers’
liability
act
and
in
that
case
as
here,
there
was
the
question
of
private
employees
suit
to
enforce
the
rights
under
that
statute.
and
there
the
court
held
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
commerce
power
as
was
the
case
here
and
the
exercise
by
congress
of
its
commerce
power
here
in
dealing
with
the
federal
--
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
the
parden
case
which
involved
the
federal
employers’
liability
act
which
is
the
act
under
which
employees
can
sue
for
redress,
for
damage
to
the
employee
and
injury
on
the
railroad.
in
that
case,
involving
a
railroad
which
was
a
state
owned
railroad
at
the
docks
of
alabama.
the
court
held
that
commerce
clause
enabled
congress
to
act
in
this
manner
to
provide
that
private
employee
remedy
that’s
lawsuit
as
a
means
of
remedy
and
the
court
held
that
this
occurred
by
virtue
of
the
continuing
operation
of
that
railroad.
the
same
principal
applying
here
and
has
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
as
to
whether
it’s
usually
engage
in,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
a
distinction
that
the
courts
have
held
to
make
the
constitutional
difference.
that
discussion
has
occurred
by
this
court
in
two
cases
involving
the
state
of
california
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief.
and
in
the
parden
case
and
numerous
other
cases
in
which
the
question
--
i
think
your
honor
is
alluding
to
the
concept
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
well,
it’s
a
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
as
here,
the
state
of
missouri
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
the
case
of
maryland
versus
wirtz
in
which
the
validity
of
the
wage-hour
law
amendments
here
before
the
court
was
dealt
with
expressly
as
to
their
constitutionality
in
that
case
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
well,
i
think
your
honor
is
alluding
to
what
we
are
familiar
with
as
the
ancient
argument
as
to
proprietary
versus
governmental
powers
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
i
presume
that
the
state
doesn’t
have
much
choice
as
to
whether
it
is
going
to
run
a
mental
hospital.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
when
congress
enacts
this
kind
of
statute
under
the
commerce
power
which
is
plenary
unlike
the
federal
taxing
power,
commerce
can
lay
down
under
the
commerce
power,
the
conditions
or
operation
in
reference
to
anything
that
affects
commerce
and
that
is
what
congress
did
in
this
case.
that
is
what
was
upheld
in
maryland
versus
wirtz.
that
is
what
was
dealt
with
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
which
involved
the
very
state
which
is
before
us
here
today
among
other
states,
the
state
of
missouri.
and
the
state
of
missouri
was
unnoticed
when
that
decision
was
handed
down
in
1968,
that
commerce
and
the
exercise
of
its
plenary
power
under
the
commerce
clause
had
determined
that
the
problem
of
labor
disputes,
the
problem
of
maintaining
of
eliminating
unfair
competition
between
the
states
and
the
effects
on
commerce
was
best
dealt
with
by
that
enactment
in
its
wisdom
and
it’s
so
acted
and
the
court
so
upheld
the
action
of
congress
in
maryland
versus
wirtz.
as
i
say,
that
case
involved
not
only
the
state
of
maryland,
but
the
state
of
missouri,
they
were
a
party
to
it.
it
was
ruled
upon.
they
continue
to
operate
thereafter.
they
were
on
full
knowledge
of
the
situation.
but
as
the
majority
held
in
the
parden
case,
such
waiver
need
be
neither
knowing
nor
intelligent.
the
point
is
that
it
is
a
matter
of
the
plenary
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
power.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
as
to
the
distinction

i
may
now
allude
to
those
words
mr.

justice.
maryland
versus
wirtz
said,
“in
the
first
place,
it
is
clear
the
federal
government,
when
acting
within
a
delegated
power
may
override
countervailing
state
interest
whether
this
be
described
as
governmental
or
proprietary
in
character.”
that
was
disposed
of
many
times
before.
mr.
chief
justice
frankfurter
in
the
indian
towing
case
which
involved
a
waiver
of
immunity
question
said,
“there
is
nothing
in
tort
claims
act
which
was
involved
there
which
shows
that
congress
intended
to
draw
distinctions
so
finespun
and
capricious”
to
use
the
words
of
the
court
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
to
be
almost
incapable
of
being
held
in
mind
for
adequate
formulation.
and
again,
in
the
rayonier
case,
rayonier
inc.
versus
united
states,
the
court
said,
“we
expressly
decided
in
indian
towing
that
an
injured
party
cannot
be
deprived
of
its
rights
under
the
act
by
resorting
to
an
alleged
distinction,
imported
from
the
law
of
municipal
corporations
between
the
government’s
negligence
when
it
acts
on
a
proprietary
capacity
and
its
negligence
when
it
acts
in
uniquely
governmental
capacity.”

zwerdling
sanitary

the

--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
there
was
reference
to
that
just
as
in
contrast
in
the
sanitary
district
case
which
i
thought,
your
honor
had
in
mind.
there
was
reference
to
the
overriding
commerce
power
enabling
the
congress
to
prevent
the
state
from
taking
water
from
lake
michigan
which
was
essential
to
its
inhabitants
because
it
was
in
contravention
of
an
enactment
by
the
state
--
by
the
united
states
in
connection
with
the
commerce
power.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
that
did
not
involve
a
private
suit.
parden
which
is
the
governing
case
here
we
believe,
parden
versus
alabama
terminal
railway
did
so
involved
private
suit.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
upheld
the
specifically
ruled
on
this
very
questioned
of
the
immunity
of
the
states
from
private
suit
and
held
that
that
immunity
did
not
fasten
to
the
extent
of
precluding
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
to
enable
this
private
suit
which
has
its
purpose,
not
simply
to
help
the
individual
as
such,
but
more
importantly
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
courts
including
parden,
the
purpose
of
enforcement
of
the
statute
of
enabling
what
could
not,
otherwise
occur
by
the
government,
the
enforcement
of
this
exercise
of
commerce
power.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
it
depends,
your
honor,
on
whether
one
is
a
mental
patient
or
one
who
is
involved
in
railroad
operation.
i
don’t
need
to
be
fictitious
whether
it’s
essential
or
not
and
one
fixes
on
mental
hospitals.
this
statute
embraces
much
more
than
mental
hospitals.
it
involves
hospitals,
institutions
which
exist
in
the
private
sector
as
well
as
the
public
sector
and
it’s
function
is
as
stated
to
by
eliminating
the
differential
between
what
must
be
paid
over
40
hours
time-and-a-half,
and
what
may
much
be
paid
minimum
wage
for
a
public
employee
as
opposed
to
a
private
employee
by
eliminating
the
unfair
competition
against
private
industry
by
that
enactment.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
we
believe
it
is
totally
unnecessary
here
for
purposes
of
this
suit
to
--
of
this
case
to
challenge
the
eleventh
amendment
interpretation,
that
is
right,
your

your

may
i
cite
what
mr.
justice
right
--
white
wrote
in
united
state
versus
california,
which
is
--
i’m
sorry
in
the
parden
case
in
which
statement
was
made
on
behalf
of
minority,
and
this
was
on
behalf
on
the
minority,
“i
agree
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
congress
to
condition
a
states’
permit
to
engage
in
the
interstate
transportation
business
which
is
what
was
involved
there.
on
a
waiver
of
the
state
sovereign
immunity
from
suits
arising
out
of
such
business,
congress
might
well
determine
that
allowing
regular
both
conducts
such
as
the
operation
of
a
railroad
to
be
undertaken
by
a
body
legally
immune
from
liability
directly
resulting
from
these
operations
is
so
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
each
regulation
that
the
state
must
be
put
to
the
option
of
either
forgoing
participation
in
the
conduct
or
consenting
to
a
legal
responsibility
or
injury
caused
thereby.”
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
your
honor.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
yes,
your
honor,
as
i
pointed
out.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
mr.
chief
justice,
my
approach
to
the
statutory
intent
here
was
perhaps
more
pedestrian
than
that
of
my
brother
debar.
i
went
to
the
statute
and
i
cited
very
carefully
and
explicitly
to
this
court
the
language
that
congress
injected
in
1966
by
its
amendments.
and
i
traced
carefully
the
result
by
virtue
of
that
set
of
statutory
amendments
and
nothing
could
be
more
explicit
than
the
congressional
intent
of
that.
i
will
not
yield
to
the
temptation
of
laundering
into
the
thicket
of
the
question
of
whether
the
state
courts
are
in
or
out.
i
would
merely
observe
that
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
only
that
the
state
courts
are
available
as
a
remedy,
congress
chose
to
give
the
employees
access
to
the
federal
system
to
the
federal
courts
with
all
of
the
advantages
that
flow
therefrom.
including
--
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
by
saying
that
in
a
definition,
in
the
amendment
of
section
3
of
the
definitions,
giving
access
to
section
16
(b)
to
these
employees
covered
by
amendments
where
it
says
in
section
16
(b)
“any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.”
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
it
is
particularly
explicit
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
since
1938
and
almost
invariably
the
suits
occur
in
federal
court.
and
congress
had
the
experience
of
all
of
the
years
since
1938
of
the
exercise
of
this
statutory
language
in
thousands
and
tens
and
thousands
of
private
employee
suits
in
federal
court
where
they
almost
been
variably
go
under
section
16
(b).
and
in
the
light
of
that
experience,
congress
and
its
amendment
of
the
definitions
chose
to
pass
on
to
the
public
employees
covered
as
it
had
in
38
private
employees
that
access.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
not
at
such,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
it
would
escape
their
attention
i
believe
it
were
--
if
it
were
not
in
question
as
it
appeared
not
to
be
in
question
since
they
enacted
this
amendments
in
1966
barely
two
years
after
this
court
handed
down
parden,
which
laid
down
the
disposition
of
this
question,
and
in
the
light
of
that
knowledge,
congress
enacted
the
amendments
of
1966.
there
are
50
states
as
this
counsel
points
out,
but
there
are
some
118,000
establishments
in
question
here
which
is
a
harsh
of
somewhat
of
different
color
in
terms
of
the
problem
of
the
secretary
of
labor
enforcement.
and
just
to
illustrate
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
complaint
here
was
filed
when?
the
compliant
was
filed
by
these
employees
in
august
of
1969
for
backpay
and
liquidated
damages
commencing
in
february
of
1967.
the
secretary
of
labor
came
in
later
in
january
of
1971,
reaching
back
only
to
january
of
1969
and
then
only
because
of
the
course
of
this
litigation
and
its
disposition.
let
me
just
conclude
by
reemphasizing
once
again
that
as
was
said
in
parden,
“by
empowering
congress
to
regulate
commerce
then,
the
states
necessarily
surrender
any
portion
of
their
sovereignty
that
would
stand
in
the
way
of
such
regulation.”
such
regulation
involves
two
parts,
two
sides
of
the
coin.
it
involves
reaching
the
substantives
matter
by
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
to
achieve
this
coverage
that
we’re
talking
about,
but
at
the
same
time,
there
goes
with
that
exercising
commerce
power
to
reach
the
remedy
which
is
the
chosen
means,
which
has
been
utilized
successfully
since
1938
which
congress
in
the
light
of
that
long
experienced
with
millions
of
situations
around
the
country
with
some
40
million
people
decided
to
extend
to
certain
limited
classes
of
state
employees
as
they
did
here.
we
believe
that
maryland
versus
wirtz
and
parden
govern
and
as
was
said
in
maryland
versus
wirtz,
i
conclude
on
this
if
i
may.
it
said
“this
court
was,
of
course,
concerned
only
with
the
finding
of
a
substantially
effect
on
interstate
competition
and
not
where
the
consequent
policy
decisions.”
quoting
another
case,
katz
and
buck,
this
court
said,
“where
we
find
that
the
legislatures
have
a
rational
basis
for
finding
a
chosen
regulatory
scheme
necessary
to
the
protection
of
commerce,
our
investigation
isn’t
at
an
end.”
may
i
submit
that
in
parden
when
that
case
was
concluded
the
court
had
already
determined
as
to
this
situation
that
that
case
--
that
this
investigation
is
at
an
end.
mr.
a.
l.
zwerdling
mr.
chief
justice,
that
argument
is
better
than
mine.
it
is
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
federal
jurisdiction,
the
availability
of
liberal
discovery
which
is
very
important
to
employees
in
these
suits,
the
uniformity
that
you
point
out,
the
fact
that
there
is
more
expertise
in
interpreting
federal
laws,
all
of
the
panoply
of
reasons,
which
would
cause
congress
to
be
moved
to
make
this
remedy
available
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
if
there
are
not
further
questions,
thank
you.
