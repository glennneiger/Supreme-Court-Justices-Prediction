we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-1021,
employees
against
to
the
department
of
public
health
and
welfare.
mr.
zwerdling,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
that
discretion
that
we
exercise
with
respect
to
an
erroneous
evaluation
of
the
law
for
example.
if
you
are
correct
in
your
case
here,
would
the
judgment
of
the
state
of
missouri
which
is
in
disagreement
with
yours
be
the
kind
of
factor
that
would
allow
the
court
to
exercise
that
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
no,
no
on
double
--
the
same
subject
as
justice
stewart
has
been
presenting
to
you
on
the
double
damages
on
the
penalty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then,
what
you’re
saying
in
effect
is
that
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
governmental
function
aspect
of
the
activity
is
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
--
that
means
you’re
telling
us
that
the
operation
of
a
mental
hospital
or
a
university
by
the
states
is
unfair
competition
against
private
universities
and
private
hospitals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
think
that
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
much
exactly
of
vast
bureaucracy
would
you
need
if
you
allocated
this
enforcement
just
with
respect
to
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
blackmar.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
you
concede
the
right
then
that
say
but
you
challenge
the
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
right
there
after
lunch.[noon
recess]
you
may
continue
mr.
blackmar.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
i
think
and
the
argument
indicated
that
about
95%
of
all
the
employees
covered
with
the
act
are
private,
truly
private
employees,
and
perhaps
4-5%
more
or
less
are
public.
do
you
quarrel
with
that
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
point
of
view,
the
only
thing
supporting
the
--
govern
the
solicitor
general’s
view
and
his
friend
is
that
it’s
more
convenient
to
let
the
private
--
the
employee
sue
in
a
private
suit
rather
than
have
the
secretary
sue
for
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
does
that
--
enlighten
me
on
this.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
whether
the
suit
is
brought
in
the
state
court
or
to
the
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
eleventh
amendment
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you’ve
indicated
or
at
least
i
thought
you
had
that
you
would
not
have
this
defense
that
you’re
arguing
to
a
suit
in
the
state
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
they
recover
double
damages
in
all
of
the
statutory
remedies
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
act
that
indicates
that
you
wouldn’t
get
the
same
remedy
in
the
state
court
as
in
the
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
you’re
really
just
arguing
the
forum,
aren’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
certainly
doesn’t
give
any
intimations
of
excluding
state
courts
--,
state
courts
being
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
i
thought
earlier
under
your
argument
you
have
virtually
conceded
that
not
in
this
last
colloquy
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
know.
i
know,
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
blackmar.
mr.
zwerdling
you
have
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
specific
language
do
you
rely
on
to
indicate
that
they
were
explicit,
i
think
you
said,
in
granting
a
federal
a
suit
against
the
state
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
you
think
that’s
explicit
enough
to
take
care
of
the
eleventh
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
legislative
history
show
any
discussion
or
consideration
of
the
eleventh
amendment
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn’t
think
that
that
would
escape
their
attention?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
zwerdling,
would
you
think
as
another
factor
to
be
taken
into
account
the
greater
uniformity
that
might
be
achieved
in
dealing
with
these
cases
in
eleventh
circuit
as
distinguished
from
50
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
