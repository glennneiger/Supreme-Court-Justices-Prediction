it’s

do
i
understand
that
if
there
is
a
recovery,
it
is
automatic
that
the

be
a
double

justice

and
it’s
a

clear
that
there

no

in

justice

for

purpose,
but
i
asked
--
i
wondered
and
i
am
asking
for
information,
is
the
law
clear
or
is
it
not
that
when
there
is
a
recovery,
the
recovery
has
to
be
a
double
recovery?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s,
is
that
clear
under
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
the
provision
further
down
in
16
(b),
the
court
in
such
action
shall
in
addition
to
any
judgment
awarded,
allow
reasonable
attorney’s
fee
to
be
paid,
that’s
of
course
in
addition
to
the
double
recovery.
justice

stewart
and
cause
and
what
is
the
law
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
discretion.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
you
know
in
the
appendix
to
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
asking
as
i
say
for
information
because
i
didn’t
know
whether
how
automatic
this
statutory
language
had
been
held
to
be.
it
sounds
as
though
there
is
no
discretion.
justice

stewart
and
that
there’s
nothing
there
about
attorney’s
fees?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
to
maryland
against
wirtz,
i
wonder
if
missouri
could
say
that
it
had
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
its
act
was
not
a
violation
of
the
federal
labor
standards
act
of
1938.
justice

stewart
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
immunity
goes,
isn’t
it
applicable
only
in

justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
the
federal
constitutional
immunity
of

is
that

justice

the

in

by
the

he
can
enjoin

and
he
can
get
a

of
the

is
that
it?

double

justice

justice
potter
stewart
and

justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
the
argument.
i
am
just
asking
for
information
and
the
--
if
the
secretary
does
move
in
and
the
wage
earners’
lawsuit
is
displaced,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
happens
when
secretary
recovers
money?
is
that
payable
immediately
to
the
employees?
justice

stewart
with
just
that
much?
justice

you

do
i
understand

you
concede
that
an

justice

and
you
do

i
would

do
you
that
so
far
as
the
federal

goals
with
its
protection
of
state
sovereign
immunity
that
protection
extends
only
to

actions?

justice

well
as
i
understood
you
general

you
haven’t
conceded,
however,
that
this
kind
of

could
be
part
of

you
simply
pointed
out
that
question
is
not

justice

i
suppose
you
could
therefore
make
the
argument
that
a

would
not
be
a
