justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
one
of
those
--
these
businesses
that
states
didn’t
usually
engage
in
railroad
or
the
railroad
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
question
is
--
the
question
is
you
say
that
labor
does
not
need
even
to
be
voluntary?
may
not
need
to
be
intelligent,
but
is
it
does
have
to
be
voluntary
to
be
labor
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
--
the
state
might
have
a
choice
about
whether
they
will
engage
in
a
railroad
business,
but
it
doesn’t
have
much
choice
about
whether
it’s
going
to
conduct
certain
operations
or
to
--
it
doesn’t
have
much
choice
about
whether
he’s
going
to
run
a
mental
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn’t
state
it.
you
brought
those
words
up,
i
didn’t.
i
just
said
that
the
state
does
not
have
much
choice
about
whether
it’s
going
to
run
to
mental
hospital.
does
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it’s
priced
for
running
a
mental
hospital
as
to
waive
its
constitutional
right
to
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
agree,
you
do
agree
that
the
state
has
a
constitutional
right
to
immunity
from
suits
by
its
own
citizens
or
citizens
of
other
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
an
eleventh
amendment
interpretation,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn’t
think
that
was
an
interpreted
to
eleventh
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
it
said
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well
anyway,
you
do
--
you
do
agree
there
is
a
constitutional
right
in
the
state
to
immunity
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
congress
could
certainly
--
the
issue
here
isn’t
whether
congress
can
impose
the
wage
and
hour
conditions
of
the
state.
the
issue
is
whether
private
individuals
can
sue
the
state
to
enforce
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
can’t
legislate
the
way
the
constitutional
immunity
just
by
saying
it
doesn’t
exist.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
its
just
private
individual
reports
--
does
the
statute
prevent
these
suits
being
brought
in
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
case
involving
a
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
spoke
it
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
function
really
is,
whether
you
can
reasonably
say
the
state
has
waived,
isn’t
that
the
basic
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
parden
is
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
want
to
do
this,
you
have
to
do
that
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what’s
all
about
it
where
there
is
consented
--
it
is
said
to
have
consented
to
suit
in
a
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
that
argument
survive
parden?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
expressly
an
congressional
intent
that
is
not
present
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
that
the
16
(c)
permit
the
employee
to
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
they
are
otherwise
competent?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
that
argument
if
there
was
a
suit
brought
under
the
act
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
you
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
really
--
your
argument
really
is
should
be
whether
the
congress
intended
to
make
the
remedy
available
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
et
al.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don’t
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
--
is
there
a
form
of
missouri
for
employees
to
stay
in
suit
for
back
pay?
let’s
assume
there
is
--
has
missouri
waived
its
own
sovereign
immunity
with
its
own?
justice
byron

is
