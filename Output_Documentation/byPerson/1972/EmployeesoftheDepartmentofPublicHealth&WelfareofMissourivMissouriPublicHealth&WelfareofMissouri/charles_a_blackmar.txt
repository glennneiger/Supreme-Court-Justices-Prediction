mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
discuss
first
of
all,
what
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
the
way
the
state
of
missouri
to
use
the
case.
first,
there’s
no
question
that
congress
has
the
power
to
include
state
schools
and
hospitals
under
the
definition
of
employer
found
in
the
federal
labor
or
fair
labor
standards
act
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
has
done
so.
that
is
maryland
versus
wirtz
in
the
1966
amendment
to
the
act.
furthermore,
there’s
no
doubt
that
missouri
has
an
obligation
to
obey
the
act.
and
looking
at
the
parden
case,
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
congress
has
power
to
require
missouri
to
waive
its
constitutional
immunity
from
suit
as
a
condition
to
entering
into
activities
where
congress
has
regulated
it
--
regulated
the
activities
pursuant
towards
commerce
power,
if
congress
so
provides.
and
finally,
there
is
no
question
presented
by
this
case
as
to
whether
a
state
court
would
be
required
to
hear
an
action
brought
under
216
(b)
or
16
(b)
by
a
private
employee
whether
that
would
be
required
either
by
federal
constitutional
law
or
by
missouri
law.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
no,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
that
question
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
i
do
not
concede
that
in
this
case
although
i
think
there
are
very
persuasive
arguments
that
certainly
could
be
made
that
the
state
court
would
under
the
sixth
amendment
or
article
6
of
the
constitution
where
it
required
to
enforce
the
federal
laws
have
a
duty
to
hear
such
a
case.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
whether
we
speak
in
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
basic
constitutional
principle
recognized
in
the
hans
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that
was
not
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
will
suggest
that
it
only
applies
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
what
is
at
issue
is
one
narrow
question
that
is
whether
the
remedies
provided
that
private
employer
by
16
(b)
were
intended
by
congress
to
be
available
to
such
employees
against
the
state
of
missouri.
now,
in
1938
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that’s
precisely
it,
your
honor.
i
feel
we
have
to
concede
the
right
on
the
basis
of
both
the
minority
and
majority
in
the
parden
case
which
recognized
that
congress
does
have
a
power
to
require
the
state
to
waive
it’s
consent
to
suit
as
a
condition
to
entering
activities
regulated
by
congress
and
the
maryland
versus
wirtz
case
which
holds
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
wages
from
schools.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
missouri’s
position.
in
1938
when
the
wage
fair
labor
standards
act
has
initially
passed,
states
were
excluded
from
coverage
of
the
act.
in
1966,
an
exception
to
that
exclusion
was
written
into
the
act
in
the
case
of
state
schools
and
hospitals.
the
act
has
four
remedy
provisions.
first
of
all,
there
are
criminal
sanctions
in
section
16
(a).
secondly,
the
secretary
of
labor
by
section
16
(c)
is
authorized
to
file
a
suit
when
requested
by
employees
in
behalf
of
the
employees
to
recover
wages
that
are
not
been
paid
to
them.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
we
were
discussing
the
four
remedies
that
congress
has
provided
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
in
matching
that
first
was
this
criminal
sanction
under
section
16
(a).
secondly,
there
was
the
suit
by
the
secretary
of
labor
when
the
employees
requested
him
to
maintain
a
suit
where
he
may
recover
unpaid
wages
in
behalf
of
the
employees
which
he
ultimately
will
turn
over
to
the
employer.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
this
is
a
suit
under
16
(c).
now,
there
is
a
remedy
under
section
17
as
to
the
third
remedy
where
the
secretary
of
labor
may
seek
an
injunction
against
the
employer
and
as
part
of
this
equitable
relief,
request
restitution
of
unpaid
wages.
it
would
seem
that
section
17
has
pretty
much
eliminated
section
16
(b)
as
an
effective
remedy
by
the
secretary
of
labor,
because
he
can
do
more
under
that
section
with
fewer
restraints
than
it
can
under
section
16
(b).
16
(b)
has
a
provision
that
he
may
not
bring
an
action
when
there
is
a
novel
legal
question
undecided
by
the
courts.
that
restraint
is
not
found
on
section
17.
and
finally,
the
remedy
of
section
16
(b)
if
i
say
16
(b)
before
i
meant
16
(c),
the
section
16
(c)
allows
private
individuals
to
sue
there
employers
to
recover
their
unpaid
compensation
an
equal
amount
as
liquidated
damages,
termed
“liquidated
damages”
are
the
words
that
congress
has
used
and
reasonable
attorney’s
fees.
i
get
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
only
16
(c)
and
this
is
the
only
situation
where
the
employer
is
required
to
pay
more
than
has
been
withheld
illegally.
again,
to
the
question
presented
in
this
case
as
specifically
and
expressly
left
unanswered
by
the
maryland
versus
wirtz
question.
and
the
question
is,
“did
the
exclusion
of
state
employees
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
automatically
result
in
an
intention
that
congress
would
make
applicable
the
16
(b)
remedies
of
private
suit
against
the
state
to
such
employers?”
really
the
question
is,
“did
congress
destroy
the
state’s
constitutional
immunity
from
suit
in
this
area?”
we
note
that
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
itself
where
the
1966
amendments
indicates
that
a
state
is
subject
to
suit
by
private
individuals
notwithstanding
its
constitutional
immunity.
it
has
often
been
observed
that
the
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
now,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not,
in
itself,
confer
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
case
arising
from
the
act
in
the
federal
courts.
the
jurisdiction
is
conferred
by
28
u.s.c.
section
1339,
which
is
a
jurisdiction
statute
and
an
act
--
deals
with
an
act
of
congress
regulating
commerce.
that
is
the
jurisdictional
section
that
the
plaintiffs
below
brought
this
case
under.
now,
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
a
federal
question
in
the
case
does
not
mean
that
the
states
are
subject
to
suit
by
private
individuals
in
the
federal
courts.
and
we
would
submit
that
since
the
basic
federal
question
jurisdictional
statute
is
little
different
except
for
jurisdiction
amount
and
the
jurisdiction
statute
that
is
involved
in
cases
of
congress
or
cases
arising
out
of
acts
of
congress
regulating
congress
that
it
can
be
argued
and
should
be
argued
that
congress
has
not
intended
one,
in
one
way
to
any
degree
to
change
the
state’s
basic
position
which
is
that
they
are
immune
from
suit
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
parden,
section
56
of
the
fela
specifically
allowed
the
employee
to
maintain
an
action
in
the
federal
courts.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
a
jurisdictional
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
jurisdiction
that
i
think
not
only
shows
an
attempt
on
congress
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
in
the
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
the
federal
courts
here
are
not
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
the
state
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
unless
the
state
has
consented
to
suit.
and
that’s
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
constitutional
principle
of
sovereign
immunity.
now,
the
parden
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
certainly
the
situation
in
missouri
as
our
brief
indicates
the
secretary
of
labor
has
filed
an
action
under
section
17
against
the
state
of
missouri.
that
action
included
some
2,000
or
3,000
employees
and
they
have
been
successful
in
that
action
and
the
state
has
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
an
appropriation
to
pay
those
employees
and
it
has
paid
those
employees.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
to
have
future
enforcement,
although
the
court
declined
an
injunction
and
to
recover
past
unpaid
compensation.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
the
purpose
of
section
16
(b)
was
to
permit
private
actions
by
the
employees.
the
suit
that
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
except
that
there
has
been
a
traditional
principle
that
the
states
are
immune
from
suit
in
the
federal
courts
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
because
it
would
have
application.
well,
16
(c)
is
the
section
that
permits
the
secretary
of
labor
to
bring
suit.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that’s
16
(b).
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
don’t
know.
i
would
think
that
there
are
different
considerations
between
public
employment
and
private
employment.
i
think
for
one
thing
that
you
have
a
single
entity
that
is
generally
inclined
to
obey
the
law.
it
is
generally
not
engaged
in
competition,
and
as
soon
as
it
can
administratively
solve
the
problems
that
exists
in
complying
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
reasonable
and
it
has
been
our
experience
in
missouri
that
it
has.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
special
incentives
possibly
to
private
employers
to
violate
the
act
in
competitive
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
competitive
advantage.
well,
congress
has
brought
some
activities
of
the
state
under
the
act,
but
i
think
that
the
congressional
purposes
in
so
doing
can
be
fully
vindicated
without
finding
that
congress
intended
that
the
state
waived
its
immunity
from
suit.
and
that
is
the
proposition
that
i
am
arguing
to
the
court
today.
congress
did
not
say
that
the
state
would
lose
its
immunity
as
a
condition
of
continuing
to
operate
state
schools
and
hospitals
after
it
became
covered
with
respect
to
those
activities.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
infer
that
that
was
the
congressional
intention.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
estimate.
very
few
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that
appears
to
be
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
and
i
thought
he
advanced
to
a
rather
novel
proposition
which
was
because
of
the
limited
staff
available
in
the
solicitor
of
labor’s
office
that
congress
must
not
have
intended
that
would
be
the
sole
vehicle
by
which
the
act
could
be
enforced
against
the
state.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
department
of
labor
has
sued
missouri
and
has
sued,
to
my
knowledge,
at
least
ten
other
states
to
recover
unpaid
overtime
compensation.
i
think
that
in
this
area
that
one
or
two
state
suits
against
the
state
pretty
much
forces
sustaining
the
containing
the
compliance.
when
that
is
done,
the
state
gives
its
employees
what
they
have
coming
under
the
act.
since
there
are
only
50
states,
i
think
sooner
or
later,
united
states
persist
in
disobeying
the
act
and
it
will
be
compelled
by
the
remedies
available
under
the
act
to
comply
whether
it
likes
it
or
not
and
it
will
not
be
particularly
difficult
for
the
secretary
of
labor
to
maintain
such
suits.
parden
recognizes
that
a
state
must
consent
to
suit
and
the
court
in
that
case
went
on
to
find
that
alabama
when
it
commenced
operation
of
a
railroad
20
years
after
the
fela
was
enacted
necessarily
consented
to
such
suit.
in
this
case,
we
would
have
to
ask,
when
did
missouri
consent?
did
it
consent
when
congress
passed
the
act
and
the
act
became
effective?
that
it
consents
after
maryland
versus
wirtz
were
decided
or
was
it
some
other
date
at
which
it
was
consented.
it
is
known
and
is
recognized
by
the
court
below
that
missouri
operated
schools
and
hospitals
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
1966
amendments.
at
some
point
according
to
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
petitioners
missouri
must
have
consented
to
the
act.
but
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
say
that
the
state
continuing
the
activities
that
it
has
historically
engaged
in,
in
which
it
had
been
recognized
as
functions
of
state
government
consented
to
waive
its
constitutional
immunity
from
suit
in
a
federal
courts.
certainly,
the
act
did
not
advise
missouri
in
express
language
that
it
was
going
to
have
to
make
what
the
district
court
in
idaho
was
temred
to
hobson’s
choice
of
either
foregoing
the
operation
of
its
schools
and
hospitals
or
consenting
to
suit
by
private
individuals
in
the
federal
court.
congress
very
easily
could
have
provided
an
expressed
waiver
provision
where
it
would
advise
the
states
that
they
would
lose
this
immunity
but
it
has
not
done
so.
and
that
leads
me
to
three
factors
which
the
court
below
distinguished
this
case
from
parden,
and
i
think
each
of
these
factors
are
very
important
in
considering
that
question
of
what
did
congress
intend
when
it
made
the
state
subject
to
the
act.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
very
nature
of
schools
and
hospitals.
there
are
traditionally
activities
states
engage
in.
considering
the
nature
of
those
activities,
is
it
reasonable
to
infer
that
congress
would
intend
that
an
employee
would
recover
double
before
the
state
were
to
spend
funds
on
the
care
of
the
patients
or
the
students
of
the
institutions
covered?
and
of
course,
there’s
the
fact
that
there
are
double
damages
and
attorney’s
fees
that
are
available
to
the
private
employees
that
they
are
permitted
to
maintain
the
suit.
it
does
not
seem
again
that
congress
would
intend
that
this
type
of
remedy
be
available
against
the
state.
i
think
that
there
are
more
--
at
least
it’s
a
policy
judgment
that
should
be
made
expressly
and
not
found
by
a
court
on
the
basis
of
silence.
and
finally,
the
court
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
would
consider
making
that
argument,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
argue
that
if
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
did
not
apply.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
i
am
not
necessarily
conceding
that
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that’s
--
well,
the
argument
--
yes,
it
would
be
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
this
goes
to
--
the
fact
that
there
are
the
double
damages,
i
think,
goes
to
the
intent
of
the
congress
and
i
think
that
when
you
have
an
extreme
remedy
of
that
nature,
that
it
certainly
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
congress
intended
that
that
type
of
remedy
would
be
available
against
the
state.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
the
parden
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
it’s
whether
the
congress
intended
that
the
state
waive
its
immunity.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
they
will
certainly
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
they
could,
and
we
would
be
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
no,
there
isn’t.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
am
arguing
the
forum
and
i
think
in
view
of
the
remedy
there
is
--
it
certainly
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
intended
that
the
forum
be
available.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes,
i
have
to
try
to
limit
it
to
that
question.
the
final
factor
i
think
the
eight
circuit
relied
on
and
i
think
is
significant
is
the
fact
that
there
are
alternative
remedies
which
will
vindicate
the
congressional
purpose
behind
the
fair
labor
standards
act
amendments.
now
in
the
parden
case,
if
the
court
had
not
found
that
the
federal
form
was
available
to
the
employee
suing
the
state
of
alabama,
he
would’ve
been
left
without
a
remedy.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
was
to
permit
injured
employees
to
recover.
now
i
think,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
it's
been
discussed
by
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
it
permits
suits
in
state
court
as
well
as
federal
court
and
expressly
and
expressly
--
expressly
says
to
either
court
this
act,
your
honors,
only
says
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
i’ve
considered
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
--
that
the
state
of
missouri
--
i
do
not
believe
the
question
is
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
but
i
would
say
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that
is
a
difficult
question
and
that
missouri
placed
on
several
cases
would
be
hard-pressed
to
argue
that
the
state
court
cannot
or
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
action.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
right,
it
would
be
right.
i’ll
probably
reverse
the
order
as
to
the
order
you
asked
the
questions
but
there
would
be
two
separate
inquiries.
if
it
wasn’t
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
missouri
historically
has
been
very,
very
reluctant
to
yield
one
bit
of
its
sovereign
immunity.
now,
there
is
a
fairly
recent
case
involving
a
state
contract
where
the
court
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
no,
it
is
basically
judicial.
we
do
not
have
constitutional
provisions
like
alabama
does
and
i
believe
illinois
which
are
very
expressed
on
that
question
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
would
hate
to
leave
myself
into
the
position
of
arguing
against
the
position.
i
may
have
to
rgue
sometime
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
and
finally,
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
consider
the
alternative
remedies
that
are
available
which
i
think
really
will
indicate
the
act
and
certainly
have
in
missouri.
after
the
secretary
of
labor
filed
his
action
in
missouri
legislature
for
the
first
time
took
cognizance
of
the
problem.
they
appropriated
a
sum
of
money
which
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
judgment.
the
people
who
had
compensation
coming
to
them
were
paid
and
the
state
was
able
to
pay
them
reserving
its
traditional
practices
of
paying
on
appropriations
and
warrants
drawn
by
the
state
treasurer,
after
action
by
the
state
legislature.
it
was
asked
as
to
whether
the
state
of
missouri
would
have
a
defense
to
the
double
damage
provisions.
section
11
of
the
portal
to
portal
act,
allows
us
an
employer
to
make
a
defense
that
the
act
or
admission
giving
rise
to
such
action
was
in
good
faith
that
is
act
or
admission
giving
rise
to
the
failure
to
pay
wages.
after
reading
the
portal
to
portal
cases,
i
do
not
--
i
am
not
at
all
share
and
i’m
rather
pessimistic
that
missouri
would
have
any
defense
that
would
meet
the
traditional
portal
to
portal
act
arguments
that
missouri
has
acted
in
good
faith
and
should
be
in
permitted
not
to
have
to
pay
the
double
damages.
this
is
a
serious
question
and
it’s
a
question
that
goes
to
where
i
think
the
heart
of
our
federal
system.
it
may
not
be
fair
from
a
strict
equity
sense
that
states
are
immune
from
suit
in
the
federal
courts
for
their
wrongs
where
there
is
established
law.
when
the
court
held
otherwise
back
in
the
case
chisholm
versus
georgia,
there
wasn’t
immediate
response
by
on
the
part
of
congress
and
the
states
with
the
enactment
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
ever
since
that
date,
the
courts
have
been
very
respectful
of
the
states
sovereign
immunity.
congress
has
not
expressly
said
that
the
states
are
to
lose
that
immunity.
i
don’t
think
it’s
fair
to
read
that
into
act
by
implication.
i
would
like
to
close
my
argument
of
this
observation.
when
the
portal
to
portal
act
was
enacted,
the
congress
started
out
with
this
finding.
the
congress
finds
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938
as
amended
has
been
interpreted
judicially
in
this
regard
of
long
established
customs
and
precedents.
i
would
think
that
if
the
court
would
find
that
missouri
has
lost
its
constitutional
immunity
that
that
would
be
a
holding
that
would
be
contrary
to
long
established
customs
and
precedents.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
discuss
first
of
all,
what
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
the
way
the
state
of
missouri
to
use
the
case.
first,
there’s
no
question
that
congress
has
the
power
to
include
state
schools
and
hospitals
under
the
definition
of
employer
found
in
the
federal
labor
or
fair
labor
standards
act
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
has
done
so.
that
is
maryland
versus
wirtz
in
the
1966
amendment
to
the
act.
furthermore,
there’s
no
doubt
that
missouri
has
an
obligation
to
obey
the
act.
and
looking
at
the
parden
case,
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
congress
has
power
to
require
missouri
to
waive
its
constitutional
immunity
from
suit
as
a
condition
to
entering
into
activities
where
congress
has
regulated
it
--
regulated
the
activities
pursuant
towards
commerce
power,
if
congress
so
provides.
and
finally,
there
is
no
question
presented
by
this
case
as
to
whether
a
state
court
would
be
required
to
hear
an
action
brought
under
216
(b)
or
16
(b)
by
a
private
employee
whether
that
would
be
required
either
by
federal
constitutional
law
or
by
missouri
law.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
no,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
that
question
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
i
do
not
concede
that
in
this
case
although
i
think
there
are
very
persuasive
arguments
that
certainly
could
be
made
that
the
state
court
would
under
the
sixth
amendment
or
article
6
of
the
constitution
where
it
required
to
enforce
the
federal
laws
have
a
duty
to
hear
such
a
case.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
whether
we
speak
in
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
basic
constitutional
principle
recognized
in
the
hans
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that
was
not
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
will
suggest
that
it
only
applies
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
what
is
at
issue
is
one
narrow
question
that
is
whether
the
remedies
provided
that
private
employer
by
16
(b)
were
intended
by
congress
to
be
available
to
such
employees
against
the
state
of
missouri.
now,
in
1938
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that’s
precisely
it,
your
honor.
i
feel
we
have
to
concede
the
right
on
the
basis
of
both
the
minority
and
majority
in
the
parden
case
which
recognized
that
congress
does
have
a
power
to
require
the
state
to
waive
it’s
consent
to
suit
as
a
condition
to
entering
activities
regulated
by
congress
and
the
maryland
versus
wirtz
case
which
holds
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
wages
from
schools.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
missouri’s
position.
in
1938
when
the
wage
fair
labor
standards
act
has
initially
passed,
states
were
excluded
from
coverage
of
the
act.
in
1966,
an
exception
to
that
exclusion
was
written
into
the
act
in
the
case
of
state
schools
and
hospitals.
the
act
has
four
remedy
provisions.
first
of
all,
there
are
criminal
sanctions
in
section
16
(a).
secondly,
the
secretary
of
labor
by
section
16
(c)
is
authorized
to
file
a
suit
when
requested
by
employees
in
behalf
of
the
employees
to
recover
wages
that
are
not
been
paid
to
them.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
we
were
discussing
the
four
remedies
that
congress
has
provided
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
in
matching
that
first
was
this
criminal
sanction
under
section
16
(a).
secondly,
there
was
the
suit
by
the
secretary
of
labor
when
the
employees
requested
him
to
maintain
a
suit
where
he
may
recover
unpaid
wages
in
behalf
of
the
employees
which
he
ultimately
will
turn
over
to
the
employer.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
this
is
a
suit
under
16
(c).
now,
there
is
a
remedy
under
section
17
as
to
the
third
remedy
where
the
secretary
of
labor
may
seek
an
injunction
against
the
employer
and
as
part
of
this
equitable
relief,
request
restitution
of
unpaid
wages.
it
would
seem
that
section
17
has
pretty
much
eliminated
section
16
(b)
as
an
effective
remedy
by
the
secretary
of
labor,
because
he
can
do
more
under
that
section
with
fewer
restraints
than
it
can
under
section
16
(b).
16
(b)
has
a
provision
that
he
may
not
bring
an
action
when
there
is
a
novel
legal
question
undecided
by
the
courts.
that
restraint
is
not
found
on
section
17.
and
finally,
the
remedy
of
section
16
(b)
if
i
say
16
(b)
before
i
meant
16
(c),
the
section
16
(c)
allows
private
individuals
to
sue
there
employers
to
recover
their
unpaid
compensation
an
equal
amount
as
liquidated
damages,
termed
“liquidated
damages”
are
the
words
that
congress
has
used
and
reasonable
attorney’s
fees.
i
get
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
only
16
(c)
and
this
is
the
only
situation
where
the
employer
is
required
to
pay
more
than
has
been
withheld
illegally.
again,
to
the
question
presented
in
this
case
as
specifically
and
expressly
left
unanswered
by
the
maryland
versus
wirtz
question.
and
the
question
is,
“did
the
exclusion
of
state
employees
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
automatically
result
in
an
intention
that
congress
would
make
applicable
the
16
(b)
remedies
of
private
suit
against
the
state
to
such
employers?”
really
the
question
is,
“did
congress
destroy
the
state’s
constitutional
immunity
from
suit
in
this
area?”
we
note
that
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
itself
where
the
1966
amendments
indicates
that
a
state
is
subject
to
suit
by
private
individuals
notwithstanding
its
constitutional
immunity.
it
has
often
been
observed
that
the
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
now,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not,
in
itself,
confer
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
case
arising
from
the
act
in
the
federal
courts.
the
jurisdiction
is
conferred
by
28
u.s.c.
section
1339,
which
is
a
jurisdiction
statute
and
an
act
--
deals
with
an
act
of
congress
regulating
commerce.
that
is
the
jurisdictional
section
that
the
plaintiffs
below
brought
this
case
under.
now,
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
a
federal
question
in
the
case
does
not
mean
that
the
states
are
subject
to
suit
by
private
individuals
in
the
federal
courts.
and
we
would
submit
that
since
the
basic
federal
question
jurisdictional
statute
is
little
different
except
for
jurisdiction
amount
and
the
jurisdiction
statute
that
is
involved
in
cases
of
congress
or
cases
arising
out
of
acts
of
congress
regulating
congress
that
it
can
be
argued
and
should
be
argued
that
congress
has
not
intended
one,
in
one
way
to
any
degree
to
change
the
state’s
basic
position
which
is
that
they
are
immune
from
suit
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
parden,
section
56
of
the
fela
specifically
allowed
the
employee
to
maintain
an
action
in
the
federal
courts.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
a
jurisdictional
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
jurisdiction
that
i
think
not
only
shows
an
attempt
on
congress
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
in
the
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
the
federal
courts
here
are
not
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
the
state
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
unless
the
state
has
consented
to
suit.
and
that’s
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
constitutional
principle
of
sovereign
immunity.
now,
the
parden
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
certainly
the
situation
in
missouri
as
our
brief
indicates
the
secretary
of
labor
has
filed
an
action
under
section
17
against
the
state
of
missouri.
that
action
included
some
2,000
or
3,000
employees
and
they
have
been
successful
in
that
action
and
the
state
has
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
an
appropriation
to
pay
those
employees
and
it
has
paid
those
employees.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
to
have
future
enforcement,
although
the
court
declined
an
injunction
and
to
recover
past
unpaid
compensation.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
the
purpose
of
section
16
(b)
was
to
permit
private
actions
by
the
employees.
the
suit
that
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
except
that
there
has
been
a
traditional
principle
that
the
states
are
immune
from
suit
in
the
federal
courts
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
because
it
would
have
application.
well,
16
(c)
is
the
section
that
permits
the
secretary
of
labor
to
bring
suit.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that’s
16
(b).
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
don’t
know.
i
would
think
that
there
are
different
considerations
between
public
employment
and
private
employment.
i
think
for
one
thing
that
you
have
a
single
entity
that
is
generally
inclined
to
obey
the
law.
it
is
generally
not
engaged
in
competition,
and
as
soon
as
it
can
administratively
solve
the
problems
that
exists
in
complying
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
reasonable
and
it
has
been
our
experience
in
missouri
that
it
has.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
special
incentives
possibly
to
private
employers
to
violate
the
act
in
competitive
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
competitive
advantage.
well,
congress
has
brought
some
activities
of
the
state
under
the
act,
but
i
think
that
the
congressional
purposes
in
so
doing
can
be
fully
vindicated
without
finding
that
congress
intended
that
the
state
waived
its
immunity
from
suit.
and
that
is
the
proposition
that
i
am
arguing
to
the
court
today.
congress
did
not
say
that
the
state
would
lose
its
immunity
as
a
condition
of
continuing
to
operate
state
schools
and
hospitals
after
it
became
covered
with
respect
to
those
activities.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
infer
that
that
was
the
congressional
intention.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
estimate.
very
few
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that
appears
to
be
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
and
i
thought
he
advanced
to
a
rather
novel
proposition
which
was
because
of
the
limited
staff
available
in
the
solicitor
of
labor’s
office
that
congress
must
not
have
intended
that
would
be
the
sole
vehicle
by
which
the
act
could
be
enforced
against
the
state.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
department
of
labor
has
sued
missouri
and
has
sued,
to
my
knowledge,
at
least
ten
other
states
to
recover
unpaid
overtime
compensation.
i
think
that
in
this
area
that
one
or
two
state
suits
against
the
state
pretty
much
forces
sustaining
the
containing
the
compliance.
when
that
is
done,
the
state
gives
its
employees
what
they
have
coming
under
the
act.
since
there
are
only
50
states,
i
think
sooner
or
later,
united
states
persist
in
disobeying
the
act
and
it
will
be
compelled
by
the
remedies
available
under
the
act
to
comply
whether
it
likes
it
or
not
and
it
will
not
be
particularly
difficult
for
the
secretary
of
labor
to
maintain
such
suits.
parden
recognizes
that
a
state
must
consent
to
suit
and
the
court
in
that
case
went
on
to
find
that
alabama
when
it
commenced
operation
of
a
railroad
20
years
after
the
fela
was
enacted
necessarily
consented
to
such
suit.
in
this
case,
we
would
have
to
ask,
when
did
missouri
consent?
did
it
consent
when
congress
passed
the
act
and
the
act
became
effective?
that
it
consents
after
maryland
versus
wirtz
were
decided
or
was
it
some
other
date
at
which
it
was
consented.
it
is
known
and
is
recognized
by
the
court
below
that
missouri
operated
schools
and
hospitals
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
1966
amendments.
at
some
point
according
to
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
petitioners
missouri
must
have
consented
to
the
act.
but
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
say
that
the
state
continuing
the
activities
that
it
has
historically
engaged
in,
in
which
it
had
been
recognized
as
functions
of
state
government
consented
to
waive
its
constitutional
immunity
from
suit
in
a
federal
courts.
certainly,
the
act
did
not
advise
missouri
in
express
language
that
it
was
going
to
have
to
make
what
the
district
court
in
idaho
was
temred
to
hobson’s
choice
of
either
foregoing
the
operation
of
its
schools
and
hospitals
or
consenting
to
suit
by
private
individuals
in
the
federal
court.
congress
very
easily
could
have
provided
an
expressed
waiver
provision
where
it
would
advise
the
states
that
they
would
lose
this
immunity
but
it
has
not
done
so.
and
that
leads
me
to
three
factors
which
the
court
below
distinguished
this
case
from
parden,
and
i
think
each
of
these
factors
are
very
important
in
considering
that
question
of
what
did
congress
intend
when
it
made
the
state
subject
to
the
act.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
very
nature
of
schools
and
hospitals.
there
are
traditionally
activities
states
engage
in.
considering
the
nature
of
those
activities,
is
it
reasonable
to
infer
that
congress
would
intend
that
an
employee
would
recover
double
before
the
state
were
to
spend
funds
on
the
care
of
the
patients
or
the
students
of
the
institutions
covered?
and
of
course,
there’s
the
fact
that
there
are
double
damages
and
attorney’s
fees
that
are
available
to
the
private
employees
that
they
are
permitted
to
maintain
the
suit.
it
does
not
seem
again
that
congress
would
intend
that
this
type
of
remedy
be
available
against
the
state.
i
think
that
there
are
more
--
at
least
it’s
a
policy
judgment
that
should
be
made
expressly
and
not
found
by
a
court
on
the
basis
of
silence.
and
finally,
the
court
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
would
consider
making
that
argument,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
argue
that
if
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
did
not
apply.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
i
am
not
necessarily
conceding
that
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that’s
--
well,
the
argument
--
yes,
it
would
be
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
this
goes
to
--
the
fact
that
there
are
the
double
damages,
i
think,
goes
to
the
intent
of
the
congress
and
i
think
that
when
you
have
an
extreme
remedy
of
that
nature,
that
it
certainly
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
congress
intended
that
that
type
of
remedy
would
be
available
against
the
state.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
the
parden
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
it’s
whether
the
congress
intended
that
the
state
waive
its
immunity.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
they
will
certainly
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
they
could,
and
we
would
be
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
no,
there
isn’t.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
am
arguing
the
forum
and
i
think
in
view
of
the
remedy
there
is
--
it
certainly
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
intended
that
the
forum
be
available.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
yes,
i
have
to
try
to
limit
it
to
that
question.
the
final
factor
i
think
the
eight
circuit
relied
on
and
i
think
is
significant
is
the
fact
that
there
are
alternative
remedies
which
will
vindicate
the
congressional
purpose
behind
the
fair
labor
standards
act
amendments.
now
in
the
parden
case,
if
the
court
had
not
found
that
the
federal
form
was
available
to
the
employee
suing
the
state
of
alabama,
he
would’ve
been
left
without
a
remedy.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
was
to
permit
injured
employees
to
recover.
now
i
think,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
it's
been
discussed
by
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
it
permits
suits
in
state
court
as
well
as
federal
court
and
expressly
and
expressly
--
expressly
says
to
either
court
this
act,
your
honors,
only
says
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
i’ve
considered
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
--
that
the
state
of
missouri
--
i
do
not
believe
the
question
is
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
but
i
would
say
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
that
is
a
difficult
question
and
that
missouri
placed
on
several
cases
would
be
hard-pressed
to
argue
that
the
state
court
cannot
or
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
action.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
right,
it
would
be
right.
i’ll
probably
reverse
the
order
as
to
the
order
you
asked
the
questions
but
there
would
be
two
separate
inquiries.
if
it
wasn’t
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
missouri
historically
has
been
very,
very
reluctant
to
yield
one
bit
of
its
sovereign
immunity.
now,
there
is
a
fairly
recent
case
involving
a
state
contract
where
the
court
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
no,
it
is
basically
judicial.
we
do
not
have
constitutional
provisions
like
alabama
does
and
i
believe
illinois
which
are
very
expressed
on
that
question
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
well,
--
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
i
would
hate
to
leave
myself
into
the
position
of
arguing
against
the
position.
i
may
have
to
rgue
sometime
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
a.
blackmar
and
finally,
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
consider
the
alternative
remedies
that
are
available
which
i
think
really
will
indicate
the
act
and
certainly
have
in
missouri.
after
the
secretary
of
labor
filed
his
action
in
missouri
legislature
for
the
first
time
took
cognizance
of
the
problem.
they
appropriated
a
sum
of
money
which
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
judgment.
the
people
who
had
compensation
coming
to
them
were
paid
and
the
state
was
able
to
pay
them
reserving
its
traditional
practices
of
paying
on
appropriations
and
warrants
drawn
by
the
state
treasurer,
after
action
by
the
state
legislature.
it
was
asked
as
to
whether
the
state
of
missouri
would
have
a
defense
to
the
double
damage
provisions.
section
11
of
the
portal
to
portal
act,
allows
us
an
employer
to
make
a
defense
that
the
act
or
admission
giving
rise
to
such
action
was
in
good
faith
that
is
act
or
admission
giving
rise
to
the
failure
to
pay
wages.
after
reading
the
portal
to
portal
cases,
i
do
not
--
i
am
not
at
all
share
and
i’m
rather
pessimistic
that
missouri
would
have
any
defense
that
would
meet
the
traditional
portal
to
portal
act
arguments
that
missouri
has
acted
in
good
faith
and
should
be
in
permitted
not
to
have
to
pay
the
double
damages.
this
is
a
serious
question
and
it’s
a
question
that
goes
to
where
i
think
the
heart
of
our
federal
system.
it
may
not
be
fair
from
a
strict
equity
sense
that
states
are
immune
from
suit
in
the
federal
courts
for
their
wrongs
where
there
is
established
law.
when
the
court
held
otherwise
back
in
the
case
chisholm
versus
georgia,
there
wasn’t
immediate
response
by
on
the
part
of
congress
and
the
states
with
the
enactment
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
ever
since
that
date,
the
courts
have
been
very
respectful
of
the
states
sovereign
immunity.
congress
has
not
expressly
said
that
the
states
are
to
lose
that
immunity.
i
don’t
think
it’s
fair
to
read
that
into
act
by
implication.
i
would
like
to
close
my
argument
of
this
observation.
when
the
portal
to
portal
act
was
enacted,
the
congress
started
out
with
this
finding.
the
congress
finds
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938
as
amended
has
been
interpreted
judicially
in
this
regard
of
long
established
customs
and
precedents.
i
would
think
that
if
the
court
would
find
that
missouri
has
lost
its
constitutional
immunity
that
that
would
be
a
holding
that
would
be
contrary
to
long
established
customs
and
precedents.
thank
you.
