mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
a
short
review
of
the
development
of
the
provision
dealing
with
benefits
for
adopted
children
may
be
helpful
in
assessing
both
whether
there
are
issues
which
ought
to
be
decided
now
despite
the
repeal
of
the
disputed
provision
after
certiorari
was
granted
and
also
in
the
merits
of
those
issues.
before
1960,
child’s
benefits
were
not
payable

the

born
or
adopted

disability.
in
1960,
the
act
was
amended
to
permit
payment
to
natural
children
born
after
the
disability
and
also
to
adopted
children
who
were
adopted
within
two
years
of
the
disability.
if
the
adoption
proceedings
had
been
started
prior
to
the
disability
or
the
child
was
already
living
with
the
wage
earner.
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefits
under
that
1960
provision.
and
the
idea
of
the
1960
provision
stated
in
the
committee
reports
was
to
assure
that
benefits
will
be
paid
to
such
children
only
when
there
is
a
basis
for
assuming
that
the
child
lost
the
source
of
support
when
the
worker
became
disabled
or
died.
and
further,
the
congress
said
that
it's
purpose
was
to
guard
against
abuse
to
adoption
of
children
solely
to
qualify
them
for
benefits.
both
in
our
view
are
perfectly
proper
concerns
of
congress
and
the
question
is
whether
the
later
68
provision
bears
a
rational
relationship
to
those
concerns.
now
as
we’ll
also
see,
the
relative
emphasis
congress
has
given
these
considerations
has
changed
over
the
years
and
particularly
between
the
68
and
72
provisions,
this
is
one
reason
that
we
disagree
that
the
constitutional
issue
would
be
the
same
under
the
72
amendments
as
it
is
under
the
1968
amendments.
and
therefore,
this
is
one
reason
we
don’t
think
that
this
broad
issue
is
appropriate
for
decision
now.
now,
in
1968
congress
liberalized
the
provision
of
section
202
dealing
with
adopted
children
disability
beneficiaries
by
providing
benefits
for
not
only
those
whose
adoption
was
contemplated
at
the
time
of
disability,
but
after
adopted
children
who
met
certain
tests
particularly
that
the
adoption
be
court
decreed
and
that
it
be
supervised
by
a
child
placement
agency.
it
was
felt
that
those
two
requirements
would
provide
adequate
protection
against
adoptions
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
benefits.
well,
they
would
cover
certain
hard
cases
which
had
arisen
under
the
old
provision.
i
will
be
noted
that
this
1968
provision
somewhat
departed
from
the
earlier
idea
that
the
statute
should
aim
only
at
taking
care
of
children
who
lost
their
source
of
support
when
the
wage
earner
was
disabled.
but
the
72
amendments
moved
back
in
that
direction.
they
still
allow
benefits
based
on
a
later
court
decreed
adoption
irrespective
of
the
time
the
court
decrees
the
adoption.
but
they
do
so
only
when
the
child
lost
the
source
of
support
because
his
parent
retired
or
became
disabled.
that
is,
they
provide
that
the
child
must
have
been
living
with
the
wage
earner
for
a
year
prior
to
the
disability
in
receiving
at
least
half
the
support
from
the
wage
earner.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
correct.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
yes
and
[voice
overlap]
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
yes,
i
think
that
that’s
correct.
that’s
what
is
left
in
this
case.
this
particular
case
is
not
moot.
we
were
aware
no
other
case
pending
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
there
is
a
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
section
1
(11)
(b)
of
the
72
amendments
provides
a
specific
time
clause
and
while
it’s
a
bit
ambiguous
that
social
security
administration
has
interpreted
that
clause
to
mean
that
as
to
applications
filed
before
the
'72
amendments
became
law
that
the
applicant
gets
the
best
of
the
two.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
yes,
but
in
cander,
i
must
say
that
its
quite
clear
that
this
plaintiff
does
not
under
either
--
this
case
is
not
moot.
the
issue
stemming
from
the
placement
agency
requirement
are
of
no
general
or
perspective
importance
there
maybe
a
few
applications
still
pending
which
raised
it
that
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
that’s
correct.
now,
turning
to
the
merits,
i
believe
that
both
of
the
petitioners,
well,
i
should
say
one
other
thing
about
the
liability
of
the
case
at
this
point
before
turning
the
merits,
and
that
is
that
the
entire
controversy
in
the
courts
below
both
statutory
and
constitutional,
was
based
on
the
particular
feature
of
the
adopted
child
benefit
provision
that
is
the
supervision
feature.
the
broader
challenge
to
section
202
is
discriminating
between
adoptive
and
natural
born
children
was
not
made
or
considered
below.
so
this
is
really
the
first
court
which
had
it
in
both
because
of
that
and
the
change
in
philosophy
between
the
68
and
72
amendments.
we
don’t
believe
it
should
be
decided
here
first.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
that’s
the
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
that
is
the
correct
statement
of
our
position.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
yes,
now
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
i
simply
can’t
say
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
mr.
justice
marshall
and
it
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well
i
don’t
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
that
this
plaintiff
is
denied
solely
because
of
that
reason.
really,
the
reason
that
issue
arises
is
because
of
the
perspective
nature
of
the
1968
amendments.
had
the
adoptive
parents
--had
68
amendments
been
the
law
when
this
adoption
took
place,
there
could’ve
been
qualification.
now
in
passing
the
amendments
in
1968,
perhaps
unfortunately
the
congress
did
not
go
back
and
try
to
pick
up
the
prior
adoptions,
but
we
would
submit
that
when
it
was
passed
in
1968
it
was
a
reasonable
provision
for
the
future,
and
the
fact
that
it
didn’t
go
back
and
pick
up
all
earlier
cases
does
not
make
it
unconstitutional.
so
i
don’t
believe
we
do
have
to
know
how
many
counties
there
are
in
this
circumstance.
but
if
it
were
relevant
unfortunately,
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
and
i
don’t
know
the
answer.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
no
mr.
justice
white,
counsel
has
represented
this
morning
that
there
is
one
other
now
and
i
don’t
doubt
to
that
maybe
so.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well,
even
assuming
that
so,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
in
out
county
agency
cannot
supervise
the
adoption.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well
in
the
first
place,
i
don’t
believe…
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well,
i
don’t
know
that
there
is
any
basis
for
the
supposition
in
the
first
place.
in
the
second
place,
assuming
that
the
number
is
small,
the
fact
that
legislation
does
not
cover
every
case
to
which
its
rationale
should
apply.
i
don’t
believe
there’s
a
basis
for
a
constitutional
invalidation
under
such
decisions
of
this
court
as
jefferson
versus
hackney
and
mcgallan.
now,
i
believe
both
of
the
petitioner’s
constitution
arguments
depend
heavily
on
the
criticism
of
the
congressional
determination
that
it
ought
to
guard
against
adoptions
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
benefits.
i’d
like
to
give
a
practical
common
place
illustration
and
why
this
danger
is
inherent
in
this
situation
of
post
disability
adoptions.
let’s
suppose
for
example
both
a
grandparent,
and
an
aunt
and
uncle
of
the
child
are
considering
adopting
the
child.
and
let’s
suppose
that
in
the
particular
case
the
aunt
and
uncle
might
be
able
to
better
educate
the
child
and
provide
him
a
home
with
children
his
age
and
for
other
reasons
might
be
a
more
suitable
home.
now,
if
the
grandparents
are
responsible
and
upstanding
citizens,
they
may
well
pass
the
state
adoption
test
and
their
petition
might
be
granted.
but
congress
recently
might
not
want
this
decision
influenced
by
the
desire
to
get
additional
social
security
benefits.
so
it
is
not
only
the
case
of
the
crass
attempt
to
use
a
child
which
is
protective
against
behind
the
adoption
by
placement
agency
case.
but
in
addition,
situation
such
as
i
have
described
and
allowing
benefits
in
the
case
of
post
disability
adoptions
only
where
a
court
decreed
the
adoption
and
the
adoption
is
supervised
by
a
placement
agency,
is
a
very
rational
way
of
being
sure
that
the
motivation
isn’t
social
security
benefits.
but
instead
the
one
specified
by
the
state’s
adoption
laws.
now,
if
this
is
so,
is
brought
home
by
a
decision
of
the
new
mexico’s
supreme
court
which
we
cite
at
page
18
of
our
brief
(inaudible).
this
was
a
grandparent
case,
and
in
that
case,
it
was
only
because
the
state
welfare
agency
pursued
the
case
all
the
way
up
to
the
highest
court
of
the
land
that
in
adoption
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
social
security
benefits
was
stopped.
now,
of
course
the
petitioner
is
going
to
urge
the
congressional
evidence
in
avoiding
this
kind
of
situation
is
excessive.
there’s
really
no
way
of
knowing
statistically
how
often
it
occurs,
or
the
congress
was
too
cautious
and
bent
over
too
far
backward
in
having
social
security
considerations
intrude
into
the
state
adoption
process.
but
we
would
submit
that
those
arguments
ought
to
be
directed
to
another
branch
of
government.
and
they
don’t
show
the
irrationality
of
the
test
congress
set
up
or
its
lack
of
relationship
to
the
goals
of
congress.
now,
to
be
sure
that
this
classification
may
not
be
perfect
and
that
this
particular
case
may
show
that
it
isn’t,
there
would
seem
to
be
some
difficulties
and
also
however,
in
what
appeared
to
be
the
principal
available
alternatives,
either
reducing
the
protection
of
both
children
and
the
public,
or
having
the
social
security
hearing
examiner
try
to
decide
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
adoptive
parents
on
the
case
by
case
basis.
furthermore,
an
after
born
natural
child
is
not
situated
identically
to
a
post
disability
adoptee
and
has
the
distinction
as
proper.
first,
the
possibility
of
the
subordination
of
the
child’s
interest
aren’t
present
in
the
case
of
the
natural
born
child.
and
second,
in
terms
of
the
wage
earner
--
the
loss
of
the
wage
earner’s
support
there
may
be
a
difference.
in
the
case
of
a
natural
child
later
conceived,
it
can’t
be
assumed
that
the
conception
was
based
on
a
decision
which
considered
the
ability
to
support
the
child.
however,
if
there
is
a
later
adoption,
we
can
assume
that
the
adopting
court
would
not
issue
the
decree
if
there
were
not
an
ability
to
support
the
child.
finally,
i
would
close
by
saying
that
we
would
consider
the
attack
in
the
child
placement
supervision
requirement
as
it
applies
to
the
particular
situation
in
west
virginia
due
to
the
lack
of
the
agency
in
some
counties
a
little
wide
off
the
mark.
again,
it
seems
directed
to
showing
that
the
act
created
an
inequity
in
this
individual
situation,
which
isn’t
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
statute.
but,
moreover
the
distinction
flows
from
the
fact
that
congress
addressed
the
problem
in
the
1968
in
the
perspective
fashion
and
didn’t
say
that
they
draw
prior
adoptions.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
you
mean,
if
the
adoption
in
the
first
place
had
been
in
a
county
where
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well,
i
would
think
that
if
the
adoption
is
valid
under
the
state
law
that
its
move
was
not
solely
for
purposes
of
qualifying
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well,
i’m
not
certain
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
adoption
could
now
be
undone
and
reinstitute
it.
i
didn’t
look
to
this
point
up
under
west
virginia
law.
i
simply
can’t
ascertain
whether
that’s
possible.
however,
one
thing
is
clear
and
that
is
that
west
virginia
does
not
like
to
revoke
in
adoption
already
granted
and
i
think
it
would
be
difficult.
but
the
law
doesn’t
directly
address
the
point.
well,
unless
there
are
questions
of
the
court.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
a
short
review
of
the
development
of
the
provision
dealing
with
benefits
for
adopted
children
may
be
helpful
in
assessing
both
whether
there

if
the

proceedings

the
disability
or
the
child
was
already
living

interpreted
that
clause
to
mean
that
as
to
applications
filed
before
the
'72
amendments
became
law
that
the
applicant
gets
the
best
of
the
two.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
yes,
but
in
cander,
i
must
say
that
its
quite
clear
that
this
plaintiff
does
not
under
either
--
this
case
is
not
moot.
the
issue
stemming
from
the
placement
agency
requirement
are
of
no
general
or
perspective
importance
there
maybe
a
few
applications
still
pending
which
raised
it
that
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
that’s
correct.
now,
turning
to
the
merits,
i
believe
that
both
of
the
petitioners,
well,
i
should
say
one
other
thing
about
the
liability
of
the
case
at
this
point
before
turning
the
merits,
and
that
is
that
the
entire
controversy
in
the
courts
below
both
statutory
and
constitutional,
was
based
on
the
particular
feature
of
the
adopted
child
benefit
provision
that
is
the
supervision
feature.
the
broader
challenge
to
section
202
is
discriminating
between
adoptive
and
natural
born
children
was
not
made
or
considered
below.
so
this
is
really
the
first
court
which
had
it
in
both
because
of
that
and
the
change
in
philosophy
between
the
68
and
72
amendments.
we
don’t
believe
it
should
be
decided
here
first.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
that’s
the
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
that
is
the
correct
statement
of
our
position.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
yes,
now
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
i
simply
can’t
say
the
record
doesn’t
disclose
mr.
justice
marshall
and
it
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well
i
don’t
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
that
this
plaintiff
is
denied
solely
because
of
that
reason.
really,
the
reason
that
issue
arises
is
because
of
the
perspective
nature
of
the
1968
amendments.
had
the
adoptive
parents
--had
68
amendments
been
the
law
when
this
adoption
took
place,
there
could’ve
been
qualification.
now
in
passing
the
amendments
in
1968,
perhaps
unfortunately
the
congress
did
not
go
back
and
try
to
pick
up
the
prior
adoptions,
but
we
would
submit
that
when
it
was
passed
in
1968
it
was
a
reasonable
provision
for
the
future,
and
the
fact
that
it
didn’t
go
back
and
pick
up
all
earlier
cases
does
not
make
it
unconstitutional.
so
i
don’t
believe
we
do
have
to
know
how
many
counties
there
are
in
this
circumstance.
but
if
it
were
relevant
unfortunately,
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
and
i
don’t
know
the
answer.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
no
mr.
justice
white,
counsel
has
represented
this
morning
that
there
is
one
other
now
and
i
don’t
doubt
to
that
maybe
so.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well,
even
assuming
that
so,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
in
out
county
agency
cannot
supervise
the
adoption.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well
in
the
first
place,
i
don’t
believe…
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well,
i
don’t
know
that
there
is
any
basis
for
the
supposition
in
the
first
place.
in
the
second
place,
assuming
that
the
number
is
small,
the
fact
that
legislation
does
not
cover
every
case
to
which
its
rationale
should
apply.
i
don’t
believe
there’s
a
basis
for
a
constitutional
invalidation
under
such
decisions
of
this
court
as
jefferson
versus
hackney
and
mcgallan.
now,
i
believe
both
of
the
petitioner’s
constitution
arguments
depend
heavily
on
the
criticism
of
the
congressional
determination
that
it
ought
to
guard
against
adoptions
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
benefits.
i’d
like
to
give
a
practical
common
place
illustration
and
why
this
danger
is
inherent
in
this
situation
of
post
disability
adoptions.
let’s
suppose
for
example
both
a
grandparent,
and
an
aunt
and
uncle
of
the
child
are
considering
adopting
the
child.
and
let’s
suppose
that
in
the
particular
case
the
aunt
and
uncle
might
be
able
to
better
educate
the
child
and
provide
him
a
home
with
children
his
age
and
for
other
reasons
might
be
a
more
suitable
home.
now,
if
the
grandparents
are
responsible
and
upstanding
citizens,
they
may
well
pass
the
state
adoption
test
and
their
petition
might
be
granted.
but
congress
recently
might
not
want
this
decision
influenced
by
the
desire
to
get
additional
social
security
benefits.
so
it
is
not
only
the
case
of
the
crass
attempt
to
use
a
child
which
is
protective
against
behind
the
adoption
by
placement
agency
case.
but
in
addition,
situation
such
as
i
have
described
and
allowing
benefits
in
the
case
of
post
disability
adoptions
only
where
a
court
decreed
the
adoption
and
the
adoption
is
supervised
by
a
placement
agency,
is
a
very
rational
way
of
being
sure
that
the
motivation
isn’t
social
security
benefits.
but
instead
the
one
specified
by
the
state’s
adoption
laws.
now,
if
this
is
so,
is
brought
home
by
a
decision
of
the
new
mexico’s
supreme
court
which
we
cite
at
page
18
of
our
brief
(inaudible).
this
was
a
grandparent
case,
and
in
that
case,
it
was
only
because
the
state
welfare
agency
pursued
the
case
all
the
way
up
to
the
highest
court
of
the
land
that
in
adoption
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
social
security
benefits
was
stopped.
now,
of
course
the
petitioner
is
going
to
urge
the
congressional
evidence
in
avoiding
this
kind
of
situation
is
excessive.
there’s
really
no
way
of
knowing
statistically
how
often
it
occurs,
or
the
congress
was
too
cautious
and
bent
over
too
far
backward
in
having
social
security
considerations
intrude
into
the
state
adoption
process.
but
we
would
submit
that
those
arguments
ought
to
be
directed
to
another
branch
of
government.
and
they
don’t
show
the
irrationality
of
the
test
congress
set
up
or
its
lack
of
relationship
to
the
goals
of
congress.
now,
to
be
sure
that
this
classification
may
not
be
perfect
and
that
this
particular
case
may
show
that
it
isn’t,
there
would
seem
to
be
some
difficulties
and
also
however,
in
what
appeared
to
be
the
principal
available
alternatives,
either
reducing
the
protection
of
both
children
and
the
public,
or
having
the
social
security
hearing
examiner
try
to
decide
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
adoptive
parents
on
the
case
by
case
basis.
furthermore,
an
after
born
natural
child
is
not
situated
identically
to
a
post
disability
adoptee
and
has
the
distinction
as
proper.
first,
the
possibility
of
the
subordination
of
the
child’s
interest
aren’t
present
in
the
case
of
the
natural
born
child.
and
second,
in
terms
of
the
wage
earner
--
the
loss
of
the
wage
earner’s
support
there
may
be
a
difference.
in
the
case
of
a
natural
child
later
conceived,
it
can’t
be
assumed
that
the
conception
was
based
on
a
decision
which
considered
the
ability
to
support
the
child.
however,
if
there
is
a
later
adoption,
we
can
assume
that
the
adopting
court
would
not
issue
the
decree
if
there
were
not
an
ability
to
support
the
child.
finally,
i
would
close
by
saying
that
we
would
consider
the
attack
in
the
child
placement
supervision
requirement
as
it
applies
to
the
particular
situation
in
west
virginia
due
to
the
lack
of
the
agency
in
some
counties
a
little
wide
off
the
mark.
again,
it
seems
directed
to
showing
that
the
act
created
an
inequity
in
this
individual
situation,
which
isn’t
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
statute.
but,
moreover
the
distinction
flows
from
the
fact
that
congress
addressed
the
problem
in
the
1968
in
the
perspective
fashion
and
didn’t
say
that
they
draw
prior
adoptions.
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
you
mean,
if
the
adoption
in
the
first
place
had
been
in
a
county
where
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well,
i
would
think
that
if
the
adoption
is
valid
under
the
state
law
that
its
move
was
not
solely
for
purposes
of
qualifying
--
mr.
walter
h.
fleischer
well,
i’m
not
certain
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
adoption
could
now
be
undone
and
reinstitute
it.
i
didn’t
look
to
this
point
up
under
west
virginia
law.
i
simply
can’t
ascertain
whether
that’s
possible.
however,
one
thing
is
clear
and
that
is
that
west
virginia
does
not
like
to
revoke
in
adoption
already
granted
and
i
think
it
would
be
difficult.
but
the
law
doesn’t
directly
address
the
point.
well,
unless
there
are
questions
of
the
court.
