justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mcclelland
as
you
know
because
of
that
1972
amendment
it’s
the
government’s
position
in
this
case
and
that
amendment
incidentally
came
along
after
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
the
government’s
position
in
this
case
that
the
writ
should
be
dismissed,
i
trust
you’ll
address
yourself
to
that
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
right
very
good,
in
your
own
time
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there’s
no
need
to.
under
government’s
theory
linda
gayle
doesn’t
get
the
benefits
either
out
of
the
law
that’s
before
us
here,
or
under
the
new
law.
so
there’s
no
occasion
to
apply
anything
from
here.
the
result
would
not
be
different
from
the
government’s
point
of
view.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
clear
that
if
the
1972
amendments
had
been
in
effect
at
the
time
that
your
case
arose,
your
case
could
not
have
arisen
because
linda
gayle
would
have
ineligible.
is
that
not
true?
justice
potter
stewart
same
fifth
amendment
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
or/and
as
against
pre-adopted
children?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it’s
a
basic
denial
of
the
ingredient
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
it’s
included
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
your
argument,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
senator
allen’s
bill
was
it
not?
that
put
the
limitation
upon
the
eligibility
of
after
adopted
children
that
you
are
here
attacking
that
is
that
had
to
be
approved
by
a
child
placement
agency
and
that
was
his
bill.
justice
potter
stewart
so
when
he
was
talking
about
no
possibility,
no
substantial
possibility
of
abuse,
he
was
talking
about
no
substantial
possibility
of
abuse
under
his
bill
which
became
law
and
which
you
are
now
attacking.
so
you
can—i
don’t
know
it
is
remark
serve,
very
helpful
to
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
attacking
the
bill
that
he
sponsored
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
but,
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
law
which
was
as
i
understand
it,
had
its
genesis
and
a
bill
sponsored
by
senator
allen,
supported
by
senators
curtis
and
dominic
and
obviously
by
the
majority
of
both
houses
ultimately,
that
that
bill
contains
in
it
a
limitation
for
adoption
of
the
eligibility
of
adopted
children
that
those
adoptions
have
taken
place
under
a
child
placement
agency.
that’s
the
knob
of
the
question
in
this
case
isn’t
it?
that’s
provision
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
been
held
by
the
agency
that
a
court
even
a
juvenile
court
or
any
other
kind
of
court
is
not
a
child
placement
agency
within
the
meaning
of
that
provision
of
the
federal
law.
that’s
what
the
issue
in
here
is,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
also
might
be
the
purpose
of
might
giving
a
child
a
name
and
making
the
child
legitimate?
justice
potter
stewart
what’s
involved
here
is
the
law
as
it
was
in
the
period
of
1968
to
1972.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
issue
here
as
i
understand
it
you
tell
me
please,
if
i
misunderstand
it,
is
the
validity
boils
down
and
that
balanced
to
the
validity
of
the
regulation
that
says
that
the
court
is
not
and
cannot
be
a
child
placement
agency.
that’s
the
specific
issue
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
its
impact
in
this
west
virginia
case
where
the
criminal
court
in
this
county
acted
as
a
juvenile
court
and
the
court
got
the
local
policeman
to
make
an
investigation
of
the
home
and
the
claim
is
that
not
to
allow
this
kind
of
a
situation
as
a
deprivation
of
due
process
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
that
your
--
before
you
move
on
to
the
merits
theory,
your
initial
argument
here
is
that
we
ought
to
dismiss
this
writ
as
has
been
probably
granted.
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
the
law
has
never
changed
and
because
of
this
beyond
the
confines
of
this
particular
case
it
has
very
little
impact
if
any,
but
you’re
not
making
the
argument
if
this
particular
case
is
moot.
justice
potter
stewart
the
rights
of
the
party
still
depend
on
the
decision
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.

as
you

i

in

i
just
--
justice

well,
there’s
