mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
going
to
be
remised
if
i
did
not
first
convey
my
appreciation
to
the
great
honorable
clerk
and
his
staff
for
their
assistance
to
us
in
this
matter,
they
are
very
nice.
the
facts
in
this
case
as
i
understand
are
not
in
dispute
by
any
of
the
parties
here.
so
i’ll
be
very
brief
and
cite
only
those
things
that
are
considered
pertinent
to
the
case.
one
that
in
the
year
1957,
mr.
morris
qualified
for
and
started
receiving
social
security
benefits,
but
in
the
year
1965
linda
gayle
kinder
was
born
and
a
few
months
after
that
was
sent
to
the
home
of
the
grandparents.
in
this
case
mr.
morris
and
resided
with
them
continuously
thereafter
until
the
present
time
as
a
matter
of
fact.
that
in
october
of
1966
mr.
morris
and
his
wife
adopted
linda
gayle.
but
in
1968
there
was
a
reapplication
for
social
security
benefits
by
mr.
morris
on
behalf
of
linda
gayle
which
were
--
and
what
is
an
issue
here.
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
social
security
act
that
we
talk
about
today,
one
has
to
do
with
section
202
(d)
(1)
and
(3).
these
are
the
ones
that
setup
eligibility
for
children.
the
one
here
states
that
a
child
shall
be
entitled
to
benefits,
if
this
child
is
living
in
the
home
of
the
petitioner
and
that
he
is
contributing
more
than
at
least
51%
of
the
support
and
so
forth
to
the
child.
section
3
has
to
do
with
eligibility
and
again
linda
gayle
is
qualified
under
that
section.
all
provisions
in
that
section
starts
out
saying
that
“shall
be
deemed
to
be
dependent”
this
has
to
do
with
the
dependency
clause.
another
one
in
issue
here
is
202
(d)
(8).
1960,
when
the
social
security
act
was
relative
to
dependency
a
lot
and
this
was
first
passed.
congress
saw
fit
to
give
benefits
to
children
born
of
qualified
social
security
recipients.
subsequent
to
that
and
shortly
after
they
put
in
the
section
pertaining
to
adopted
children,
if
the
child
lived
in
the
home
of
the
petitioner
of
the
recipient
at
least
one
year
prior
to
the
time
that
he
shall
have
reached
his
old
age
or,
disability
or
what
have
you.
in
1967,
subsequent
to
the
date
of
the
adoption
of
linda
gayle,
congress
amended
this
particular
section
and
put
in
this
202
(d)
(8).
and
they
started
talking
about
children
adopted
by
an
eligible
beneficiary
recipient.
and
here
the
key
one
in
which
we
are
interested
today
upon
which
this
court
accepted
this
case
has
to
do
with
child
placement.
congress
said
that
“if
a
child
can
on
the
adoption,
at
the
adoption
proceeding
was
supervised
or
was
handled
through
a
public
or
private
child
placement
agency
then
this
adopted
child
could
qualify
for
benefits.”
i
might
also
add
here
that
on
october
the
30th
of
1972,
that
congress
again
amended
this
section
202
(d)
(8)
and
we’re
now
back
to
where
we
were
in
1960
which
means
that
unless
a
child
shall
have
lived
in
the
home
of
the
petitioner
for
not
less
than
one
year
prior
to
the
time
that
he
reaches
eligibility
for
old
age
assistance
or
the
date
that
he
would
become
eligible
for
request
for
disability
benefits
that
the
child
cannot
qualify.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
as
a
practice
sir,
i’m
on
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
--
excited
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
pertaining
to
this
and
the
fact
that
that
respondent
has
raised
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
writ
was
probably
granted,
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
i’m
happy
that
the
question
was
raised
because
it
does
bring
this
--
at
least
i
would
hope
that
it
would
bring
this
new
amendment
before
this
court
for
consideration
today.
one
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
i
say
sir
that
i
would
hope
that
you
would
the
fact
that
we
are
considering
that
at
this
time.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
answer
is
negative.
so
far
as
other
case
there
has
been
started,
the
answer
is
yes
sir
there
have.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
you
have
only
this
case
before
you,
that’s
true
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
no
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
correct.
i’ll
say
that
by
virtue
of
the
appeal
of
this
particular
section
in
the
social
security
act
that
this
client,
linda
gayle
was
not—would
not
be
affected
and
for
several
reasons.
one
of
them
was
that
her
application
for
benefits
was
timely
filed.
in
other
words,
she
applied
for
benefits
under
this
new
section.
in
february
of
1968,
the
year
that
that
particular
section
went
into
effect
i
think
in
january
or
december
--
january
’67.
the
rights
of
many
people
or
individuals
similarly
situated
as
linda
gayle
would
be
in
this
particular
instance
have
not
been
affected
by
the
repeal
of
this
new
act
in
social
security,
new
202
(d)
(8).
there
are
other
cases
pending
now
on
that
section
no
later
than
i
think
last
week
or
a
week
before
last.
the
new
case
was
started
in
my
own
county
affecting
the
same.
and
also
this
new
act
will
affect
only
a
small
class
of
claimants,
because
those
that
are
not
within
this
classification
of
having
lived
with
the
beneficiary
for
let’s
say
at
least
a
year
prior
to
his
eligibility,
would
be
affected
the
others
would
not.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
sir,
on
the
issues
that
i’m
bringing
forth
here
today
and
the
issues
of
discrimination
against
adopted
children,
they
would
not
be
affected
either
way
had
this,
let’s
assume
that
you
should
decide
at
this
particular
moment
right
now.
this
case
has
been
improvidently
granted.
i
could
and
i’m
sure
that
i
would
be
requested
to
do
so
to
go
home
and
ask
mr.
morris
to
go
out
and
reapply
that
the
issue
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
affects
after
adopted
children
must
go
before
this
court
for
determination
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
in
this
case.
the
case
was
first
started
on
the
court
below,
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
judge
field
decided
to
take
the
same
position
as
the
hearing
examiner.
he
didn’t
get
into
this,
only
briefly
that
it
was
brought
up
in
the
appellate
court.
those
questions
are
still
here,
i
would
bring
this
case
next
week
under
the
new
one
because
the
same
issues
are
there
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
and
i
might
also
add
that
this
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
considered
in
the
cases
below.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
as
effects
after
adopted
children
sir,
as
against
children
born
as
issue
of
the
recipient.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
exactly
right
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir.
there’s
a
couple
of
things
i
would
like
to
say
or
get
into
this
particular
question
right
quick
and
try
to
take
most
of
my
time
on
that.
as
mr.
justice
whitegold,
mr.
renolds
here
yesterday
says
“and
your
fifth
argument
is
the
fact
that
the
court,
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
against
and
you
and
so
forth”.
i
will
say
that
here
in
addition
to
this,
the
case
of
haggler
against
finch
which
was
relied
on
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
their
holding
in
this
case
together
with
the
strong
alliance
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
and
his
brief
here.
there
is
a
little
statement
in
that
court
opinion
that
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
here.
in
haggler
case
of
course,
this
court
denied
certiorari,
but
after
having
admitted
that
this
child,
there
was
no
abuse
involved,
so
far
as
the
adoption
of
this
child
was
concerned.
the
court
said
this,
“the
hagglers
lacking
guidance
through
the
statutory
of
402
(d)
have
wondered
in
to
a
trap
design
to
snare
only
the
undeserving.
their
plight
suggests
the
need
for
more
flexible
statutory
requirements.”
yet
congress
not
the
court
should
be
the
source
of
any
new
statutory
provisions.
so,
the
two
cases
that
obviously
are
relied
on
here
is
the
fourth
circuit
holding
the
way
they
did
and
the
ninth
circuit
holding
the
way
that
they
did.
the
main
thrust
of
my
argument
today,
i’ll
get
away
from
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
and
that
have
cited
in
the
briefs
and
so
forth
like
levy
and
webber
and
stanley
and
so
forth,
and
get
to
one
that
was
recently
decided
by
this
court
no
later
than
less
than
a
month
ago,
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
december
the
18th
i
think
it
was,
where
they
affirmed
the
case
of
davis
against
richardson
342
f.
supp.
588
it
was.
there,
we’re
talking
again
in
terms
of
an
illegitimate
child.
i
will
not
go
into
the
facts
to
that
case
as
to
reason
to
this
court.
you’re
fairly
familiar
with
it
and
what
you
decided
and
so
forth.
i’ll
stay
away
from
the
holdings
relative
to
social
security
and
welfare.
but
there
are
silva’s
1
and
2,
i
would
like
to
read
because
as
a
guideline
for
me.
one,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
as
to
the
federal
government
statutes
creating
arbitrary
discriminations
which
have
no
rational
basis
and
legitimate
governmental
purposes.
and
two
that
although
congress
has
great
latitude
to
make
classifications
in
the
area
of
economic
and
welfare
legislation,
a
provision
must
have
some
rational
basis
or
be
pertinent
to
some
proper
objective
of
congress
in
order
to
withstand
challenge
under
the
due
process
clause.
your
honor,
the
fact
that
congress
has
seen
fit
to
deny
after
adopted
children
which
they
have
done.
the
benefits
that
are
now
accruing
to
those
children
that
have
been
previously
adopted
or
children
that
will
be
born
to
the
social
security
recipients
subsequent
to
his
receiving
benefits,
i
think
falls
decidedly
within
this
classification.
and
when
congress
considered
of
this
thing,
in
reading
the
congressional
record
on
what
they
had
to
say,
now
senator
allen
got
into
the
question
of
“will
these
calls
abuse?”
and
calls
individuals
to
go
out
and
adopt
children
to
supplement
their
own
income.
the
two
things
i
would
like
to
mention
on
that
senator
curtis
also
had
some
observations
on
that.
one
of
them
is,
they
checked
the
actuarial
expert
there
and
he
came
back
and
said,
“well
look,
there
would
be
maybe
a
fraction
of
1%
involved,
should
we
grant
full
benefits
to
these
adopted
children.”
they
admitted
on
the
floor
that
they
each
knew
of
personal
cases
where
it
seemed
unjust
to
not
give
these
individuals
a
privilege
of
being
entitled
to
these
benefits.
i
think
sir
and
as
this
is
my
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
no,
all
i’m
asking
you
this
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
in
this
particular
instance
sir,
i’m
not
attacking
his
bill.
i’m
all
favor
of
his
bill,
but
i
am
attempting
to
attack
and
starting
the
attack
is
the
question
of
abuse
and
in
this
particular
instance,
as
it
would
affect
this
question
of
consideration
between
the
two
classes
of
individuals.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that
also
is
correct
sir.
what
i
am
saying
here
this
morning
sir
is
that
the
possibilities
and
the
probabilities
of
a
grandparent
adopting
a
child
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
money,
i
think
is
just
too
far
remote
for
such
a
consideration.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
mr.
chief
justice,
of
the
200
and
some
odd
cases
that
we
have
relative
to
adoptions
that
we’ve
had
since
i’ve
been
with
this
particular
program
in
the
last
six
years,
more
than
50%
of
them
have
been
grandparents
adopting
children.
i
would
dare
say
that
no
one
of
those
grandparents
whether
the
child
be
legitimate
or
born
out
of
wedlock.
the
question
of
money,
does
not
enter
into
it.
it’s
a
question
of
love
and
affection
on
the
part
of
grandparents
that
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
--
i’m
sure
that’s
the
court
is
well
aware
of
that.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
home
for
them
generally
sir,
that’s
the
case
here.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
they
could
do
that.
in
many
instances
they
do,
do
it,
but
when
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
correct,
that’s
as
to
those
who
are
born
of
wedlock
that’s
true
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
but
it
does
do
however
sir
if
in
the
absence
of
a
natural
parent.
it
does
provide
for
them
and
give
to
them
short
of
going
out
and
getting
and
oppressing
a
guardianship
the
legal
rights
to
the
child
to
order
certain
things
done
on
their
behalf.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
as
a
general
thing
sir,
i
will
say
this
that
the
children
come
to
a
grandparent
during
times
of
adversity
regardless
of
what
the
adversity
happens
to
be.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir,
under
our
laws
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
any
adoption
sir,
under
our
adoption
laws
make
the
adopting
parent
in
the
same
position
exactly
as
if
that
child
had
been
born
in
lawful
wedlock,
and
any
and
every
respect,
our
courts
and
our
laws
have
been
following
that
classification
had
gone
just
as
far
as
they
possibly
can
in
doing
that.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir?
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
well,
for
one
thing
sir,
authorization
for
medical
attention
--surgical
attention
and
that
sort
of
thing,
for
the
responsibility
of
the
child
as
a
parent
rather
than
let’s
say
as
a
foster
parents,
or
just
as
a
friend
as
babysitter.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that
this
child
then
becomes
a;,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
a
natural
child.
that
the
name
is
changed.
that
any
records
no
reference
could
ever
be
made
by
anybody
in
the
future
that
this
child
was
not
a
child
born
of
this
actual
marriage.
they
received
the
rights
of
inheritance.
the
natural
parents
lose
that
same
right.
all
the
rights,
duties
and
responsibilities
under
an
adoption
in
west
virginia
flow
to
an
adopting
parent
and
to
the
child
just
the
same
as
if
the
child
had
been
born
in
lawful
wedlock.
as
pertains,
when
we’re
talking
about
benefits
and
so
forth
had
in
this
particular
instance
mr.
morris
rather
than,
at
the
time
he
adopted
this
child,
of
course
he
could
not
have
taken
advantage
of
going
to
the
child
placement
agency
because
he
adopted
the
child
a
year
previous
to
the
time
this
law
went
into
effect,
a
year
or
two
maybe.
if
he
had
chosen
to
say
as
the
fourth
circuit
put
it,
if
well
he
could’ve
given
this
child
to
the
welfare
department
and
then
the
welfare
department
could’ve
given
it
back
to
him
and
that
would’ve
been
alright,
then
there
would’ve
been
compliance
with
this
requirement.
but
sir,
if
he
is
going
to
give
him
the
welfare
department
or
a
child
placement
agency,
under
our
laws
the
best
interest
of
the
child
according
to
law,
he
may
or
may
not
have
gotten
the
child
back
if
they
could’ve
found
a
good
home
for
it,
they
would
have
placed
this
child
elsewhere.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
no
sir,
no
sir,
i’m
saying
what
a
placement
agency
could
have
done
or
our
welfare
department
which
is
about
the
only
thing
that
we
have
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
all
it
comes
close
to
being
a
child
placement
agency
or
public
placement
agency.
but
had
he
done
this,
had
he
set
up
his
home
as
a
foster
home
and
says
now,
“you
send
the
child
over
to
me
and
as
a
foster
child
since
the
parents
were
then
gone.”
he
had
gotten
more
money
by
the
foster
home
by
a
replacement
angle
then
he
would
have
more
social
security
benefits.
the
difference
was
i
think
about
$8.00
a
month.
as
a
question
of
the
real
issue
why
we
are
here,i
would
like
to
catch
it,
real
quick
before
my
time
is
up.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
thank
you
sir.
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
questions
of
our
court
here
and
whether
or
not
this
is
properly
the
--
but
before
our
juvenile
court
and
whether
or
not
that
is
a
placement
agency
and
since
my
time
is
almost
up
your
honor,
i
would
respectively
request
of
this
court
that
that
question,
i
think
is
really
fully
covered
within
our
brief
and
i
would
ask
that
this
thing
of
child
placement
agencies
as
it
relates
to
the
west
virginia
laws
would
be
considered
by
this
court
on
brief.
thank
you
so
much
for
your
consideration.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
your
honor
on
the
question
of
adoptions
and
placements
here
there
is
no
way
that
i
could
give
justice
to
that
in
two
minutes
and
all
i
can
say
is,
well,
thank
you
for
your
consideration.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
going
to
be
remised
if
i
did
not
first
convey
my
appreciation
to
the
great
honorable
clerk
and
his
staff
for
their
assistance
to
us
in
this
matter,
they
are
very
nice.
the
facts
in
this
case
as
i
understand
are
not
in
dispute
by
any
of
the
parties
here.
so
i’ll
be
very
brief
and
cite
only
those
things
that
are
considered
pertinent
to
the
case.
one
that
in
the
year
1957,
mr.
morris
qualified
for
and
started
receiving
social
security
benefits,
but
in
the
year
1965
linda
gayle
kinder
was
born
and
a
few
months
after
that
was
sent
to
the
home
of
the
grandparents.
in
this
case
mr.
morris
and
resided
with
them
continuously
thereafter
until
the
present
time
as
a
matter
of
fact.
that
in
october
of
1966
mr.
morris
and
his
wife
adopted
linda
gayle.
but
in
1968
there
was
a
reapplication
for
social
security
benefits
by
mr.
morris
on
behalf
of
linda
gayle
which
were
--
and
what
is
an
issue
here.
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
social
security
act
that
we
talk
about
today,
one
has
to
do
with
section
202
(d)
(1)
and
(3).
these
are
the
ones
that
setup
eligibility
for
children.
the
one
here
states
that
a
child
shall
be
entitled
to
benefits,
if
this
child
is
living
in
the
home
of
the
petitioner
and
that
he
is
contributing
more
than
at
least
51%
of
the
support
and
so
forth
to
the
child.
section
3
has
to
do
with
eligibility
and
again
linda
gayle
is
qualified
under
that
section.
all
provisions
in
that
section
starts
out
saying
that
“shall
be
deemed
to
be
dependent”
this
has
to
do
with
the
dependency
clause.
another
one
in
issue
here
is
202
(d)
(8).
1960,
when
the
social
security
act
was
relative
to
dependency
a
lot
and
this
was
first
passed.
congress
saw
fit
to
give
benefits
to
children
born
of
qualified
social
security
recipients.
subsequent
to
that
and
shortly
after
they
put
in
the
section
pertaining
to
adopted
children,
if
the
child
lived
in
the
home
of
the
petitioner
of
the
recipient
at
least
one
year
prior
to
the
time
that
he
shall
have
reached
his
old
age
or,
disability
or
what
have
you.
in
1967,
subsequent
to
the
date
of
the
adoption
of
linda
gayle,
congress
amended
this
particular
section
and
put
in
this
202
(d)
(8).
and
they
started
talking
about
children
adopted
by
an
eligible
beneficiary
recipient.
and
here
the
key
one
in
which
we
are
interested
today
upon
which
this
court
accepted
this
case
has
to
do
with
child
placement.
congress
said
that
“if
a
child
can
on
the
adoption,
at
the
adoption
proceeding
was
supervised
or
was
handled
through
a
public
or
private
child
placement
agency
then
this
adopted
child
could
qualify
for
benefits.”
i
might
also
add
here
that
on
october
the
30th
of
1972,
that
congress
again
amended
this
section
202
(d)
(8)
and
we’re
now
back
to
where
we
were
in
1960
which
means
that
unless
a
child
shall
have
lived
in
the
home
of
the
petitioner
for
not
less
than
one
year
prior
to
the
time
that
he
reaches
eligibility
for
old
age
assistance
or
the
date
that
he
would
become
eligible
for
request
for
disability
benefits
that
the
child
cannot
qualify.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
as
a
practice
sir,
i’m
on
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
--
excited
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
pertaining
to
this
and
the
fact
that
that
respondent
has
raised
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
writ
was
probably
granted,
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
i’m
happy
that
the
question
was
raised
because
it
does
bring
this
--
at
least
i
would
hope
that
it
would
bring
this
new
amendment
before
this
court
for
consideration
today.
one
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
i
say
sir
that
i
would
hope
that
you
would
the
fact
that
we
are
considering
that
at
this
time.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
answer
is
negative.
so
far
as
other
case
there
has
been
started,
the
answer
is
yes
sir
there
have.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
you
have
only
this
case
before
you,
that’s
true
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
no
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
correct.
i’ll
say
that
by
virtue
of
the
appeal
of
this
particular
section
in
the
social
security
act
that
this
client,
linda
gayle
was
not—would
not
be
affected
and
for
several
reasons.
one
of
them
was
that
her
application
for
benefits
was
timely
filed.
in
other
words,
she
applied
for
benefits
under
this
new
section.
in
february
of
1968,
the
year
that
that
particular
section
went
into
effect
i
think
in
january
or
december
--
january
’67.
the
rights
of
many
people
or
individuals
similarly
situated
as
linda
gayle
would
be
in
this
particular
instance
have
not
been
affected
by
the
repeal
of
this
new
act
in
social
security,
new
202
(d)
(8).
there
are
other
cases
pending
now
on
that
section
no
later
than
i
think
last
week
or
a
week
before
last.
the
new
case
was
started
in
my
own
county
affecting
the
same.
and
also
this
new
act
will
affect
only
a
small
class
of
claimants,
because
those
that
are
not
within
this
classification
of
having
lived
with
the
beneficiary
for
let’s
say
at
least
a
year
prior
to
his
eligibility,
would
be
affected
the
others
would
not.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
sir,
on
the
issues
that
i’m
bringing
forth
here
today
and
the
issues
of
discrimination
against
adopted
children,
they
would
not
be
affected
either
way
had
this,
let’s
assume
that
you
should
decide
at
this
particular
moment
right
now.
this
case
has
been
improvidently
granted.
i
could
and
i’m
sure
that
i
would
be
requested
to
do
so
to
go
home
and
ask
mr.
morris
to
go
out
and
reapply
that
the
issue
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
affects
after
adopted
children
must
go
before
this
court
for
determination
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
in
this
case.
the
case
was
first
started
on
the
court
below,
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
judge
field
decided
to
take
the
same
position
as
the
hearing
examiner.
he
didn’t
get
into
this,
only
briefly
that
it
was
brought
up
in
the
appellate
court.
those
questions
are
still
here,
i
would
bring
this
case
next
week
under
the
new
one
because
the
same
issues
are
there
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
and
i
might
also
add
that
this
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
considered
in
the
cases
below.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
as
effects
after
adopted
children
sir,
as
against
children
born
as
issue
of
the
recipient.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
exactly
right
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir.
there’s
a
couple
of
things
i
would
like
to
say
or
get
into
this
particular
question
right
quick
and
try
to
take
most
of
my
time
on
that.
as
mr.
justice
whitegold,
mr.
renolds
here
yesterday
says
“and
your
fifth
argument
is
the
fact
that
the
court,
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
against
and
you
and
so
forth”.
i
will
say
that
here
in
addition
to
this,
the
case
of
haggler
against
finch
which
was
relied
on
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
their
holding
in
this
case
together
with
the
strong
alliance
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
and
his
brief
here.
there
is
a
little
statement
in
that
court
opinion
that
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
here.
in
haggler
case
of
course,
this
court
denied
certiorari,
but
after
having
admitted
that
this
child,
there
was
no
abuse
involved,
so
far
as
the
adoption
of
this
child
was
concerned.
the
court
said
this,
“the
hagglers
lacking
guidance
through
the
statutory
of
402
(d)
have
wondered
in
to
a
trap
design
to
snare
only
the
undeserving.
their
plight
suggests
the
need
for
more
flexible
statutory
requirements.”
yet
congress
not
the
court
should
be
the
source
of
any
new
statutory
provisions.
so,
the
two
cases
that
obviously
are
relied
on
here
is
the
fourth
circuit
holding
the
way
they
did
and
the
ninth
circuit
holding
the
way
that
they
did.
the
main
thrust
of
my
argument
today,
i’ll
get
away
from
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
and
that
have
cited
in
the
briefs
and
so
forth
like
levy
and
webber
and
stanley
and
so
forth,
and
get
to
one
that
was
recently
decided
by
this
court
no
later
than
less
than
a
month
ago,
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
december
the
18th
i
think
it
was,
where
they
affirmed
the
case
of
davis
against
richardson
342
f.
supp.
588
it
was.
there,
we’re
talking
again
in
terms
of
an
illegitimate
child.
i
will
not
go
into
the
facts
to
that
case
as
to
reason
to
this
court.
you’re
fairly
familiar
with
it
and
what
you
decided
and
so
forth.
i’ll
stay
away
from
the
holdings
relative
to
social
security
and
welfare.
but
there
are
silva’s
1
and
2,
i
would
like
to
read
because
as
a
guideline
for
me.
one,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
as
to
the
federal
government
statutes
creating
arbitrary
discriminations
which
have
no
rational
basis
and
legitimate
governmental
purposes.
and
two
that
although
congress
has
great
latitude
to
make
classifications
in
the
area
of
economic
and
welfare
legislation,
a
provision
must
have
some
rational
basis
or
be
pertinent
to
some
proper
objective
of
congress
in
order
to
withstand
challenge
under
the
due
process
clause.
your
honor,
the
fact
that
congress
has
seen
fit
to
deny
after
adopted
children
which
they
have
done.
the
benefits
that
are
now
accruing
to
those
children
that
have
been
previously
adopted
or
children
that
will
be
born
to
the
social
security
recipients
subsequent
to
his
receiving
benefits,
i
think
falls
decidedly
within
this
classification.
and
when
congress
considered
of
this
thing,
in
reading
the
congressional
record
on
what
they
had
to
say,
now
senator
allen
got
into
the
question
of
“will
these
calls
abuse?”
and
calls
individuals
to
go
out
and
adopt
children
to
supplement
their
own
income.
the
two
things
i
would
like
to
mention
on
that
senator
curtis
also
had
some
observations
on
that.
one
of
them
is,
they
checked
the
actuarial
expert
there
and
he
came
back
and
said,
“well
look,
there
would
be
maybe
a
fraction
of
1%
involved,
should
we
grant
full
benefits
to
these
adopted
children.”
they
admitted
on
the
floor
that
they
each
knew
of
personal
cases
where
it
seemed
unjust
to
not
give
these
individuals
a
privilege
of
being
entitled
to
these
benefits.
i
think
sir
and
as
this
is
my
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
no,
all
i’m
asking
you
this
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
in
this
particular
instance
sir,
i’m
not
attacking
his
bill.
i’m
all
favor
of
his
bill,
but
i
am
attempting
to
attack
and
starting
the
attack
is
the
question
of
abuse
and
in
this
particular
instance,
as
it
would
affect
this
question
of
consideration
between
the
two
classes
of
individuals.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that
also
is
correct
sir.
what
i
am
saying
here
this
morning
sir
is
that
the
possibilities
and
the
probabilities
of
a
grandparent
adopting
a
child
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
money,
i
think
is
just
too
far
remote
for
such
a
consideration.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
mr.
chief
justice,
of
the
200
and
some
odd
cases
that
we
have
relative
to
adoptions
that
we’ve
had
since
i’ve
been
with
this
particular
program
in
the
last
six
years,
more
than
50%
of
them
have
been
grandparents
adopting
children.
i
would
dare
say
that
no
one
of
those
grandparents
whether
the
child
be
legitimate
or
born
out
of
wedlock.
the
question
of
money,
does
not
enter
into
it.
it’s
a
question
of
love
and
affection
on
the
part
of
grandparents
that
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
--
i’m
sure
that’s
the
court
is
well
aware
of
that.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
home
for
them
generally
sir,
that’s
the
case
here.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
they
could
do
that.
in
many
instances
they
do,
do
it,
but
when
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that’s
correct,
that’s
as
to
those
who
are
born
of
wedlock
that’s
true
sir.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
but
it
does
do
however
sir
if
in
the
absence
of
a
natural
parent.
it
does
provide
for
them
and
give
to
them
short
of
going
out
and
getting
and
oppressing
a
guardianship
the
legal
rights
to
the
child
to
order
certain
things
done
on
their
behalf.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
as
a
general
thing
sir,
i
will
say
this
that
the
children
come
to
a
grandparent
during
times
of
adversity
regardless
of
what
the
adversity
happens
to
be.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir,
under
our
laws
--
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
any
adoption
sir,
under
our
adoption
laws
make
the
adopting
parent
in
the
same
position
exactly
as
if
that
child
had
been
born
in
lawful
wedlock,
and
any
and
every
respect,
our
courts
and
our
laws
have
been
following
that
classification
had
gone
just
as
far
as
they
possibly
can
in
doing
that.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
yes
sir?
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
well,
for
one
thing
sir,
authorization
for
medical
attention
--surgical
attention
and
that
sort
of
thing,
for
the
responsibility
of
the
child
as
a
parent
rather
than
let’s
say
as
a
foster
parents,
or
just
as
a
friend
as
babysitter.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
that
this
child
then
becomes
a;,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
a
natural
child.
that
the
name
is
changed.
that
any
records
no
reference
could
ever
be
made
by
anybody
in
the
future
that
this
child
was
not
a
child
born
of
this
actual
marriage.
they
received
the
rights
of
inheritance.
the
natural
parents
lose
that
same
right.
all
the
rights,
duties
and
responsibilities
under
an
adoption
in
west
virginia
flow
to
an
adopting
parent
and
to
the
child
just
the
same
as
if
the
child
had
been
born
in
lawful
wedlock.
as
pertains,
when
we’re
talking
about
benefits
and
so
forth
had
in
this
particular
instance
mr.
morris
rather
than,
at
the
time
he
adopted
this
child,
of
course
he
could
not
have
taken
advantage
of
going
to
the
child
placement
agency
because
he
adopted
the
child
a
year
previous
to
the
time
this
law
went
into
effect,
a
year
or
two
maybe.
if
he
had
chosen
to
say
as
the
fourth
circuit
put
it,
if
well
he
could’ve
given
this
child
to
the
welfare
department
and
then
the
welfare
department
could’ve
given
it
back
to
him
and
that
would’ve
been
alright,
then
there
would’ve
been
compliance
with
this
requirement.
but
sir,
if
he
is
going
to
give
him
the
welfare
department
or
a
child
placement
agency,
under
our
laws
the
best
interest
of
the
child
according
to
law,
he
may
or
may
not
have
gotten
the
child
back
if
they
could’ve
found
a
good
home
for
it,
they
would
have
placed
this
child
elsewhere.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
no
sir,
no
sir,
i’m
saying
what
a
placement
agency
could
have
done
or
our
welfare
department
which
is
about
the
only
thing
that
we
have
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
all
it
comes
close
to
being
a
child
placement
agency
or
public
placement
agency.
but
had
he
done
this,
had
he
set
up
his
home
as
a
foster
home
and
says
now,
“you
send
the
child
over
to
me
and
as
a
foster
child
since
the
parents
were
then
gone.”
he
had
gotten
more
money
by
the
foster
home
by
a
replacement
angle
then
he
would
have
more
social
security
benefits.
the
difference
was
i
think
about
$8.00
a
month.
as
a
question
of
the
real
issue
why
we
are
here,i
would
like
to
catch
it,
real
quick
before
my
time
is
up.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
thank
you
sir.
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
questions
of
our
court
here
and
whether
or
not
this
is
properly
the
--
but
before
our
juvenile
court
and
whether
or
not
that
is
a
placement
agency
and
since
my
time
is
almost
up
your
honor,
i
would
respectively
request
of
this
court
that
that
question,
i
think
is
really
fully
covered
within
our
brief
and
i
would
ask
that
this
thing
of
child
placement
agencies
as
it
relates
to
the
west
virginia
laws
would
be
considered
by
this
court
on
brief.
thank
you
so
much
for
your
consideration.
mr.
e.
r.
mcclelland
your
honor
on
the
question
of
adoptions
and
placements
here
there
is
no
way
that
i
could
give
justice
to
that
in
two
minutes
and
all
i
can
say
is,
well,
thank
you
for
your
consideration.
