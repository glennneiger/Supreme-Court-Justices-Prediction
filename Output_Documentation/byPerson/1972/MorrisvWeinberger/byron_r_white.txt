in
what
sense
mr.
mcclelland,
do
you
say
the
same
fifth
amendment
issues
are
here
under
the
amendment
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
purpose
then
of
their
adopting
the
grandchild?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
simply
they
do
that
without
adoption?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that’s
not
applied
to
those
born
in
wedlock.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
all
of
your
grandparent/grandchild
adoptions
are
situations
where
the
“a
natural
parent”
is
absent
to
the
death
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
fleischer,
could
you
tell
me
why
the
new,
in
the
72
amendment
does
not
apply
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
even
the
applicant
--
if
by
some
possibility
the
applicant
is
disqualified
under
the
68
and
72
provisions,
he
could
still
take
advantage
if
the
72
act
if
he
qualifies
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
it
still
then
that
the
‘72
provisions
would
not
be
applied
to
disqualify
who
would
qualify
them
to
a
previous?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don’t
know
of
any
other
actual
cases
that
depend
on
this?
