mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
purposes
of
this
appeal,
the
facts
are
not
really
in
dispute
in
this
case.
what
happened
essentially
is
that
on
may
15,
1969,
our
clients,
david
moor
in
one
case
and
the
plaintiff
william
donovan
rundle,
jr.
in
the
other
case
were
shot
by
an
alameda
county
deputy
sheriff
in
connection
with
the
people’s
park
disturbances
in
berkeley.
subsequently,
a
suit
was
filed,
actually
two
suits
against
the
deputy
that
shot
our
clients,
his
superior
officers
for
their
own
acts
and
the
county
of
alameda.
the
concern
here
is
only
with
that
aspect
of
the
case
against
the
county
of
alameda.
what's
involved
here
are
three
separate
and
distinct
concepts
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
first
is
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction,
the
second,
pendent
jurisdiction
and
the
third,
diversity
jurisdiction.
the
diversity
jurisdiction
issue
relates
only
to
the
moor
case.
it
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
the
rundle
case.
of
these
three
issues,
we
would
submit
that
the
clearest
example
of
error
by
the
court
below
is
in
connection
with
its
ruling
on
the
diversity
issue.
for
over
100
years,
this
court,
courts
of
appeals,
district
courts
and
at
least
two
district
courts
within
the
ninth
circuit
have
consistently
held
that
political
subdivisions
of
a
state
such
as
the
county
of
alameda
are
considered
citizens
of
the
state
for
diversity
jurisdiction
purposes.
for
some
unexplained
reason,
we
have
the
rather
anomalous
result
that
with
respect
to
california
counties,
they
are
presently
not
considered
citizens
of
california
for
diversity
jurisdiction
purposes.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
barring
at
least
a
circumstance
which
would
show
that
the
state
is
in
essence,
the
real
party
in
interest
in
the
case
is
correct
and
i
can't
think
of
a
political
subdivision
such
as
a
county
in
any
state
in
the
union
where
that
would
be
the
case.
consistently,
in
every
case
we
have
researched
on
the
point,
it
has
always
been
that
the
county
is
separate
and
distinct
from
the
state.
taking
this
case
for
example,
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
california
law
and
california
politics
would
have
to
concede,
that
the
state
of
california
is
not
the
real
party
in
interest
in
this
case,
no
liability
is
being
sought
against
it.
if
we
procure
a
judgment,
it
won't
be
liable
for
it.
indeed,
it's
not
even
a
party
and
interest,
let
alone
a
real
party
in
interest.
so,
for
those
reasons,
i
would
urge
on
the
court
that
even
if
we
are
successful
with
respect
to
the
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
contention
or
the
pendent
jurisdiction
aspect
or
both,
that
court
also
reversed
the
diversity
aspect
jurisdiction
holding.
i
know
for
a
fact
that
it
has
had
serious
effect
for
example,
on
out
of
state
contractors,
who
wish
to
sue
counties
upon
which,
with
which
they
contract
in
the
state.
as
a
result,
of
the
holding
in
this
court,
there
is
diversity
jurisdiction.
county
is
not
a
citizen
and
there
is
just
no
explanation
given
for
that
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
there
are
really
only
two
opinions
by
the
ninth
circuit
that
even
enunciate
that
point.
one
is
the
miller
case
which
was
a
pro
per
case
and
then
our
case
in
which
it
was
cited
as
authority.
i
think,
one
could
search
both
of
those
opinions
in
vain
to
find
any
reasoned
analysis
as
to
why
in
essence,
the
court
feels
that
the
state
of
california
is
somehow
the
real
party
in
interest
in
our
case
and
that's
really
what
you
have
to
conclude,
to
conclude
it's
a
state
agency.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
would
say,
two
clear
examples
of
the
two
district
courts
within
the
ninth
circuit
who
have
refused
to
follow
the
ninth
circuit
holding,
the
oregon
case
and
the
arizona
case,
which
at
length
analyzed
the
nature
of
the
county
and
showed
quite
conclusively
that
it
wasn't
the
state
of
oregon
or
the
state
or
arizona.
there
are
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
which
also
engage
in
this
kind
of
analysis.
indeed,
some
of
them
say
that's
the
kind
of
analysis
you
should
make,
when
a
claim
is
made,
that
the
particular
defendant
is
as
in
essence
a
state
agency.
no
such
analysis
was
made
here.
we
have
briefed
at
length
in
our
brief
all
of
the
powers
and
functions
of
the
county
of
alameda
that
distinguish
it
from
the
state
of
california.
i
think,
both
the
county
and
the
state
would
be
surprised
if
they
found
that
they
were
considered
one
and
the
same.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
starting
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
you
can't
sue
a
state,
the
---
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
and
many
courts
have
held
that
a
state
cannot
be
a
citizen
of
itself
and
that's
a
firmly
established
rule
that
we
don't
even
question
in
this
case.
we're
not
here
contending
that
the
state
is
even
a
party,
let
alone
a
real
party
in
interest.
we
will
live
with
that
holding.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
that
is
correct.
it's
clearly
not
--
the
state
is
clearly
not
the
real
party
in
interest
in
this
case.
turning
next
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
they
have
long
been
held
to
be
citizens
of
a
state
for
diversity
jurisdiction
purposes
and
the
most
recent
enunciation
by
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
that
counties
are
quasi
corporations
of
that
nature.
turning
next
to
the
civil
rights
act's
jurisdiction
aspect
of
our
appeal,
i
think,
you
have
to
take
it
step
by
step
and
the
first
question
is,
does
section
1983
allow
for
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior,
that's
the
first
basic
question.
if
one
was
to
look
at
hesselgesser
versus
reilly,
mcdaniel
v.
carroll,
lewis
versus
brautigam,
clearly,
it
seems
that
conceptually
there
is
such
allowance.
an
additional
case
which
i
would
add
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
but
which
specifically
discusses
this
point
is
a
case
called
hill
versus
toll,
320
f.
supp.
185,
at
pages
188
and
189
which
involved
pennsylvania
law.
and
briefly
the
court
there
addressed
itself
specifically
to
the
respondeat
superior
concept
and
said
in
essence
as
regards
to
this
case,
we
note
that
the
well
settled
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
is
not
expressly
abolished
by
section
1983,
nor
does
the
legislative
history
make
it
clear
that
congress
intended
the
doctrine
not
to
apply
to
section
1983.
further,
the
salutary
reason
for
the
doctrine’s
application,
the
common
law
torts,
i.e.,
the
furnishing
of
a
deep
pocket
from
which
a
claimant
can
collect,
argues
just
as
forcefully
for
its
application
to
the
cause
of
action
created
by
section
1983
and
conversely,
we
find
that
it
is
no
wise
less
appropriate
to
apply
respondeat
superior
to
section
1983
than
to
common
law
torts.
accordingly,
we
now
decide
consistent
with
the
traditional
injunction
that
remedial
statutes
are
to
receive
a
liberal
construction
that
respondeat
superior
is
impliedly
a
part
of
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
once
you
accept
that
premise,
you
next
look
to
the
source
of
that
vicarious
liability.
we
are
not
here
arguing
today,
that
the
source
of
that
liability
is
section
1983.
we
are
not
here
arguing
that
the
source
of
that
by
vicarious
liability
is
any
other
civil
rights
act,
federal
law,
rather
we
are
saying
the
source
of
that
vicarious
liability
is
the
california
tort
claims
act,
state
law.
just
as
the
source
of
the
sheriff's
vicarious
liability
in
hesselgesser,
the
sheriff
and
sheriff
madigan
(ph)
vicarious
liability
in
mcdaniel
and
the
sheriff's
vicarious
liability
in
lewis
were
state
law,
no
difference.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
to
my
knowledge,
no
case
has
been
cited
to
us
and
as
result
of
the
tort
claims
act,
the
law
says
the
county
can
sue
and
be
sued.
we
presume
that
when
it
says
the
county
can
sue,
it
means,
it
can
be
a
plaintiff,
as
well
as,
a
defendant.
specific
authorization
was
given
in
1963
by
the
california
law
for
that.
now
turning
then
to
the
source
of
liability,
two
rather
anomalous
results
would
occur
if
the
defendant’s
position
is
adopted
and
they
are
as
follows.
up
until
1963,
the
california
law
was
that
the
sheriff
was
vicariously
liable
for
the
torts
committed
by
his
deputy.
a
case
called
reynolds
versus
lerman,
138
cal.
app.
2d
586
specifically
held
that.
when
the
tort
claims
act
was
enacted
in
1963,
section
820.8
was
enacted
which
specifically
says
that
one
public
employee
cannot
be
vicariously
liable
for
the
acts
of
another
public
employee,
rather
it's
the
employing
public
entity.
now,
the
whole
policy
of
the
tort
claims
act
was
obviously
to
place
ultimate
financial
responsibility
where
it
could
best
be
realized
and
to
allow
the
party
injured
by
a
public
employee
opportunity
for
meaningful
redress.
yet,
if
we
adopt
the
defendant’s
position,
where
california
sought
to
increase
the
likelihood,
that
a
plaintiff
might
recover
for
the
wrongs
of
their
public
employee,
we
would
have
the
opposite
effect
in
this
case
because
we
would
say
in
essence
that
well,
he
could
have
sued
the
sheriff
vicariously
under
cases
such
as
we
have
discussed,
somehow
he
can't
sue
the
county.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
and
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
such
exception
that
would
apply.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
not
to
my
knowledge.
second,
the
logical
result
of
the
defendant’s
position
is
simply
not
only,
that
a
federal
court
cannot
impose
that
state
created
liability,
but
because
congress
did
not
intend
for
public
entities
to
bear
this
ultimate
liability
that
a
state
court
can't
even
impose
it
and
indeed,
a
state
can't
pass
such
a
law.
and
yet,
i
cannot
imagine
that
the
defendants
are
here
even
taking
the
position
that
california
as
a
matter
of
its
law
doesn't
have
authority,
power
or
what
have
you
to
pass
a
law
saying
that
its
public
entities
will
be
vicariously
liable
for
the
torts
of
their
employees,
including
civil
rights
act's
violations.
that's
a
state
law
determination.
that's
is
a
state
policy
determination.
and
the
only
next
question
then
becomes,
can
a
federal
court
also
impose
that
state
created
liability?
to
that,
we
look
to
1988
and
section
1343.
now,
1988
is
not
a
jurisdictional
section.
it
doesn't
create
any
cause
of
action,
it
doesn't
confer
any
jurisdiction.
title
28,
1343
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
and
in
the
words
that
i
believe,
any
act
of
congress
which
is
provided
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights.
looking
at
section
1988,
if
it's
not
an
act
of
congress,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
and
if
it
wasn't
designed
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights,
i
don't
know
what
it
was
passed
for.
it
clearly
falls
within
that
language
and
thus
there
is
no
violation
to
monroe,
to
1983
or
to
any
other
civil
rights
act
provision
by
saying
that
the
federal
court
can
utilize
1988
in
the
fashion
it
was
intended
and
have
jurisdiction
to
impose
that
state
created
liability.
this
then
brings
me
to
the
final
jurisdictional
contention
we
make,
and
which
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult.
that
is,
if
we
assume
arguendo
that
by
some
quirk
1988
doesn't
mean
what
it
says,
that
the
california
tort
claims
act
cannot
impose
this
vicarious
liability,
but
can
at
the
same
time
impose
vicarious
liability
for
the
state
battery
or
state
negligence,
wrongs
committed
by
the
public
employee.
can
the
county
be
joined
as
a
pendent
party
on
the
pendent
state
claims
that
are
otherwise
before
the
court?
now,
in
a
sense,
we
have
something
like
and
astor-honor
type
analysis
because
you
do
have
a
federal
statute
which
can
be
construed
along
with
pendent
jurisdiction
really
to
bring
about
the
result
of
joining
the
county.
but
taking
it
just
in
the
abstract
for
the
moment,
we're
concerned
here
with
the
concept
of
judicial
power,
not
discretion.
there
is
no
opinion
from
this
court
that
we
are
aware
of
that
has
precisely
discussed
the
joinder
of
a
pendent
party.
the
trend
since
gibbs
has
been
certainly
that
pendent
jurisdiction
can
be
utilized,
that
the
considerations
and
policy
which
led
to
its
liberalization
and
were
further
liberalized
in
rosado,
and
that
if
the
criteria
otherwise
available
for
pendent
jurisdiction,
there
was
at
least
the
power
to
join
a
pendent
--
perhaps
a
pendent
party.
now,
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth
and
eight
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
expressly
recognized
this
judicial
power.
the
sixth
circuit
by
implication
has
recognized
this
power,
yet
the
ninth
circuit
stands
alone.
it
is
the
only
circuit
to
our
knowledge
which
expressly
holds
that
pendent
jurisdiction
does
not
allow
for
the
joinder
of
parties,
only
claims.
taking
this
case
for
the
moment,
if
we
look
to
the
traditional
test,
does
the
claim
arise
out
of
the
nucleus
of
operative
fact,
clearly,
there
isn't
even
an
additional
fact
involved
with
respect
to
the
county’s
liability
because
it's
vicarious
and
the
dependent
solely
upon
that
liability
of
the
individuals.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
that's
not
correct.
diversity
is
only
in
moor.
one
must
get
to
civil
rights
act
jurisdiction
and/or
pendent
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
that
is
in
both.
pendent
jurisdiction,
if
we
are
correct
on
diversity
in
moor,
then
in
theory,
the
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
contention
and
the
pendent
party
jurisdiction
aspect
may
not
have
to
be
reached
although
there
would
be
an
open
question
as
to
whether
or
not
as
to
the
federal
causes
of
action,
if
the
county
was
joined
on
diversity,
it
could
--
there
would
still
potential
liability.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
rundle.
they
are
companion
cases
as
they
were
consolidated
for
appeal.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
with
the
possible
exception
of
1988,
the
civil
rights
act
because
the
diversity
jurisdiction
question
would
leave
open
whether
or
not
the
county
was
vicariously
liable
for
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
that's
correct
and
in
that
sense,
one
would
not
have
to
reach
it.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
neither
or
both,
the
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no.
they
are
separate
cases.
the
plaintiffs
in
rundle
are
california
citizens,
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
it
was
never
even
raised,
never
argued,
both
of
these
people
were
shot
at
the
same
time
in
same
place
and
perhaps
with
the
same
shot.
that's
why
the
two
cases
were
brought
together,
they
involved
all
of
the
same
issues
factually
with
respect
to
ultimate
liability.
the
only
distinction
that
moor
has
is
he
is
an
illinois
resident
and
as
a
result,
we
were
able
to
raise
the
diversity
jurisdiction
issue,
but
rundle
has
to
be
resolved
by
either
a
resolution
of
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
and/or
pendent
party
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
clearly,
if
we
decide
on
the
basis
–
well,
if
you
decide
that
there
is
a
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
civil
rights
acts,
then
you
really
don't
have
pendent
party
joinder
anymore,
you
just
have
traditional
pendent
jurisdiction
joinder
because
now
you
are
joining
claims
against
whom
you,
a
party
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
yes,
right.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
or
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
pardon?
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
to
bring
the
county,
correct.
there
are
pendent
state
claims
now
pending
against
the
deputy
and
the
other
individuals.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
one
would
think
you
would
clearly
have
the
state
law
claims.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
am
saying
as
follows.
in
this
order,
the
scope
of
the
civil
rights
act
covers
both
the
federal
and
state
claims.
there
is
no
dispute
that
it
covers
the
state
claims
and
for
some
unexplained
reason,
the
defendants
have
not
briefed
in
their
brief
to
the
court
any
argument
that
the
california
law
does
not
also
cover
the
federal
claims.
so,
perhaps
they
have
abandoned
that,
i
don't
know.
however,
true
pendent
party
joinder
in
one
sense
would
be
only
joining
the
county
on
the
pendent
state
law
claims
without
regard
to
the
federal
claims
because
once
you
say
that
the
county
also
has
vicarious
liability
for
the
federal
claims
then
i
think
you
clearly
within
19
--
you
have
to
deal
with
1988
and
then
you
get
into
an
independent
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
through
1343,
because
now
you
are
talking
about
imposing
a
vicarious
federal
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
oh!
i
have
had
everything
i
want.
whether
--
if
i
prevail
on
diversity
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
--
and
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
or
pendent
party.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
it's
all
state
law
vicarious
liability
that's
being
imposed.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct,
if
i
could
get
the
county
into
the
case.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
theoretically
yes
because
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
on
the
civil
rights
act,
but
i
think
that
we
tried
to
explain
to
the
court
on
our
brief
that
given
the
nature
of
this
case
which
involves
federal
constitutional
rights.
if
there
is
a
type
of
case
that
really
should
be
brought
in
a
federal
court,
i
would
think
this
is
the
type
and
i
don't
think
--
and
i
think
it's
a
to
go
--
this
court
has
said
before
that
merely
because
you
can
go
to
the
state
court
isn't
grounds
for
denying
your
choice
for
a
federal
forum
for
a
adjudication
of
your
federal
constitutional
rights.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
but
i
might
have
been
similarly
thrown
out
of
the
state
court
altogether.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no
question
about
it.
if
we
concede
that
the
power
exists,
the
next
question
is
discretion.
however,
i
think
any
fair
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
will
show
that
it
never
reached
the
discretionary
aspect.
it
specifically
said,
the
issue
is
not
one
of
discretion,
but
rather
lack
of
power.
the
district
court
further
said,
it
intimates
no
view
on
how
he
would
decide
the
case,
if
he
was
possessed
of
the
power
but
because
of
hymer
versus
chai,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
which
specifically
said,
there
is
no
power
for
that
joinder,
the
district
court
never
reached
that.
there
would
not
be
discretion
however
with
respect
to
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction,
if
we
are
correct.
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
let
me
correct
a
couple
of
points.
on
consolidation,
appendix
c
to
the
petitioner
will
show
how
the
case
has
became
consolidated.
they
were
consolidated
by
the
ninth
circuit
for
this
appeal
only.
they
have
never
been
consolidated
for
trial.
indeed,
at
one
point
we
tried
to
have
them
consolidated,
the
county
opposed
the
motion
for
consolidation.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
none
at
all.
rundle
must
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
rundle
will
stand
to
fall
on
the
civil
rights
acts
in
pendent
jurisdiction
or
points.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
oh!
no.
the
whole
concept
of
the
pendent
jurisdiction
implies
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
of
the
case
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
well,
except
in
courts
of
appeal,
i
am
sure
they
got
along
that
point
and
pendents
and
claims
of
citizens
of
the
same
states,
once
they
had
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
matter,
but
we
are
not
raising
that
at
all.
we
are
not
saying
that
rundle’s
is
a
pendent
case.
indeed,
the
injuries
are
different
and
the
case
will
be
tried
separately.
a
second
point
that
i
think
we
should
dispel
is
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
opinion
attached
to
our
replied
brief
which
is
the
latest
one
by
judge
peckam
(ph)
in
this
case,
you
will
see
that
the
discretion
area
x
is
not
even
an
issue.
the
court
has
completely
rejected
those
for
these
individuals.
number
three
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
at
the
moment,
that
is
correct
and
that
is
their
posture.
they
are
separate
cases
to
be
tried
separately.
they
have
not
been
consolidated
for
trial
or
for
any
other
purpose
except
this
appeal
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
order
at
our
request
to
bring
the
cases
on.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no
question
about
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no.
the
state
court
action,
your
honor,
was
filed
for
this
reason
in
15m
(ph)
jury
trial,
section
26
at
pages
617
and
618,
they
talked
about
a
chicago
practice.
because
of
monroe,
it
is
unclear
and
it
wasn't
clear
that
we
would
ultimately
be
successful
in
bringing
the
county
into
this
case,
for
that
reason
we
wanted
to
protect
our
client.
a
former
associate
of
ours
did
some
research
in
the
area
and
concluded
that
we
had
no
problem
as
to
diversity,
so
we
filed
the
moor
case
only
in
the
federal
court.
however,
because
of
the
unknown
factors
in
rundle,
we
filed
only
in
the
state
court.
for
the
past
three
years,
we
have
never
done
anything
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
only
in
rundle.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
and
that
we
have
never
done
anything
with
the
state
court
action
include
serving
it
until
about
a
month
ago
when
under
california
law,
if
a
case
is
not
served
within
three
years
of
filing,
it
is
automatically
dismissed.
in
the
federal
case,
we
have
taken
some
15
depositions,
had
extensive
discovery,
extensive
motions
we
have
--
the
federal
case
has
been
the
case
we
have
filed
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
right,
but
we
are
talking
about
rundle
because
it's
got
the
companion
state
case.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
would
hate
to
think
that
our
client
in
rundle
would
be
prejudiced
by
our
seeking
to
protect
him
and
to
obviate
the
very
thing
that
we
are
trying
to
obviate
having
to
go
two
courts
with
the
same
case.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
just
as
in
any
pendent
jurisdiction
case,
with
diversity
case
i
suppose,
sure,
we
had
that
option,
but
we
chose
the
federal
forum
because
we
felt
we
would
get
--
there
were
many
factors
which
dictated
our
going
into
the
federal
forum
and
i
would
--
jury,
they
were
balancing
factors.
you
could
get
to
trial
faster
in
federal
court
generally
than
in
the
state
court.
there
were
many
factors.
the
federal
judiciary
was
much
more
familiar
with
the
civil
rights
acts,
we
thought.
we
know
of
no
state
court
reported
opinions
construing
the
civil
rights
acts.
indeed,
if
one
look
at
the
opinions
of
judge
peckam
in
this
case
where
he
has
agreed
with
us
and
disagreed
with
us,
at
least
he
has
enunciated
some
pretty
extensive
opinions.
on
the
point
about
complicating
the
case
by
adding
the
county,
it's
just
a
fallacy.
the
same
defenses
which
were
available
to
the
county
are
available
to
the
individual
employee
defendants.
we
have
to
say,
it
is
by
our
right
to
sue
county
in
order
to
sue
the
individuals.
the
same
instructions
are
going
to
be
a
part
of
this
case.
and
with
respect
to
insurance,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
shows
that
these
employees
have
insurance
of
any
sort.
i
can
tell
you
as
a
fact
that
the
officer
that
shot
my
client
is
making
approximately
$8,000.00
a
year
and
doesn't
have
any
insurance
to
our
knowledge.
the
county
carries
insurance.
they
are
the
only
ones
we
know
that
carries
insurance
aside
from
sheriff
madigan
smaller
bond
of
some
25,000.00,
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
showing
that
these
defendants
are
financially
able
to
respond
to
the
kind
of
judgment
we
are
seeking
in
this
case,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
but
they
are
not.
no,
this
really
was
never
raised
as
a
point
and
indeed
i
think
common
sense
would
say
that
the
deep
pocket
in
this
case
is
unquestionably
the
county.
moreover,
under
california
law,
in
order
to
sue
other
county
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
think
that's
is
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no
and
perhaps
or
court
take
judicial
notice
on
it,
but
the
county
has
got
of
deeper
pocket
than
the
shot
--
the
deputy
who
shot
my
client.
however,
with
respect
to
another
important
reason
for
a
judgment
against
the
county,
in
california,
if
you
want
to
sue
other
counties
who
participated
in
a
particular
act,
you
must
get
a
judgment
against
one
county.
in
connection
with
the
people’s
park
disturbances,
there
were
a
number
of
counties
involved
in
that
situation.
only
if
we
procure
a
judgment
against
the
county
of
alameda
can
we
then
sue
this
other
counties
which
we
would
intend
to
do
and
finally,
on
congressional
intent,
i
have
found
nothing
that
even
remotely
indicates
that
congress
intended
not
only
not
to
impose
liability
as
a
result
of
the
sherman
amendment
debates,
not
only
did
not
intend
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
of
imposed
liability,
but
when
further
and
said,
we
intend
to
preclude
a
state
from
imposing
vicarious
liability
on
its
public
entities.
i
think
that
kind
of
congressional
intent
is
pure
fabrication,
it's
not
found
in
the
debates
and
it's
not
found
in
monroe.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
monroe
says
and
monroe
is
concerned
only
with
1983
liability,
footnote
2
of
that
opinion
makes
clear
that's
the
only
section
that
was
before
the
court
and
the
court
held
that
on
the
basis
of
the
sherman
amendment
debates,
congress
did
not
intend
to
impose
liability
by
virtue
of
1983.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
it's
correct.
it
is
in
the
meeting
of
1983
for
purposes
of
imposing
federal
liability.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
that's
not
our
position
here.
we
say
there
is
nothing
in
monroe
and
nothing
in
the
congressional
debates
or
any
other
place
that
we
know
off
which
says
that
congress
also
did
not
intended
to
preclude
a
state
as
a
matter
of
its
law
from
imposing
that
liability.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
purposes
of
this
appeal,
the
facts
are
not
really
in
dispute
in
this
case.
what
happened
essentially
is
that
on
may
15,
1969,
our
clients,
david
moor
in
one
case
and
the
plaintiff
william
donovan
rundle,
jr.
in
the
other
case
were
shot
by
an
alameda
county
deputy
sheriff
in
connection
with
the
people’s
park
disturbances
in
berkeley.
subsequently,
a
suit
was
filed,
actually
two
suits
against
the
deputy
that
shot
our
clients,
his
superior
officers
for
their
own
acts
and
the
county
of
alameda.
the
concern
here
is
only
with
that
aspect
of
the
case
against
the
county
of
alameda.
what's
involved
here
are
three
separate
and
distinct
concepts
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
first
is
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction,
the
second,
pendent
jurisdiction
and
the
third,
diversity
jurisdiction.
the
diversity
jurisdiction
issue
relates
only
to
the
moor
case.
it
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
the
rundle
case.
of
these
three
issues,
we
would
submit
that
the
clearest
example
of
error
by
the
court
below
is
in
connection
with
its
ruling
on
the
diversity
issue.
for
over
100
years,
this
court,
courts
of
appeals,
district
courts
and
at
least
two
district
courts
within
the
ninth
circuit
have
consistently
held
that
political
subdivisions
of
a
state
such
as
the
county
of
alameda
are
considered
citizens
of
the
state
for
diversity
jurisdiction
purposes.
for
some
unexplained
reason,
we
have
the
rather
anomalous
result
that
with
respect
to
california
counties,
they
are
presently
not
considered
citizens
of
california
for
diversity
jurisdiction
purposes.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
barring
at
least
a
circumstance
which
would
show
that
the
state
is
in
essence,
the
real
party
in
interest
in
the
case
is
correct
and
i
can't
think
of
a
political
subdivision
such
as
a
county
in
any
state
in
the
union
where
that
would
be
the
case.
consistently,
in
every
case
we
have
researched
on
the
point,
it
has
always
been
that
the
county
is
separate
and
distinct
from
the
state.
taking
this
case
for
example,
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
california
law
and
california
politics
would
have
to
concede,
that
the
state
of
california
is
not
the
real
party
in
interest
in
this
case,
no
liability
is
being
sought
against
it.
if
we
procure
a
judgment,
it
won't
be
liable
for
it.
indeed,
it's
not
even
a
party
and
interest,
let
alone
a
real
party
in
interest.
so,
for
those
reasons,
i
would
urge
on
the
court
that
even
if
we
are
successful
with
respect
to
the
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
contention
or
the
pendent
jurisdiction
aspect
or
both,
that
court
also
reversed
the
diversity
aspect
jurisdiction
holding.
i
know
for
a
fact
that
it
has
had
serious
effect
for
example,
on
out
of
state
contractors,
who
wish
to
sue
counties
upon
which,
with
which
they
contract
in
the
state.
as
a
result,
of
the
holding
in
this
court,
there
is
diversity
jurisdiction.
county
is
not
a
citizen
and
there
is
just
no
explanation
given
for
that
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
there
are
really
only
two
opinions
by
the
ninth
circuit
that
even
enunciate
that
point.
one
is
the
miller
case
which
was
a
pro
per
case
and
then
our
case
in
which
it
was
cited
as
authority.
i
think,
one
could
search
both
of
those
opinions
in
vain
to
find
any
reasoned
analysis
as
to
why
in
essence,
the
court
feels
that
the
state
of
california
is
somehow
the
real
party
in
interest
in
our
case
and
that's
really
what
you
have
to
conclude,
to
conclude
it's
a
state
agency.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
would
say,
two
clear
examples
of
the
two
district
courts
within
the
ninth
circuit
who
have
refused
to
follow
the
ninth
circuit
holding,
the
oregon
case
and
the
arizona
case,
which
at
length
analyzed
the
nature
of
the
county
and
showed
quite
conclusively
that
it
wasn't
the
state
of
oregon
or
the
state
or
arizona.
there
are
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
which
also
engage
in
this
kind
of
analysis.
indeed,
some
of
them
say
that's
the
kind
of
analysis
you
should
make,
when
a
claim
is
made,
that
the
particular
defendant
is
as
in
essence
a
state
agency.
no
such
analysis
was
made
here.
we
have
briefed
at
length
in
our
brief
all
of
the
powers
and
functions
of
the
county
of
alameda
that
distinguish
it
from
the
state
of
california.
i
think,
both
the
county
and
the
state
would
be
surprised
if
they
found
that
they
were
considered
one
and
the
same.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
starting
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
you
can't
sue
a
state,
the
---
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
and
many
courts
have
held
that
a
state
cannot
be
a
citizen
of
itself
and
that's
a
firmly
established
rule
that
we
don't
even
question
in
this
case.
we're
not
here
contending
that
the
state
is
even
a
party,
let
alone
a
real
party
in
interest.
we
will
live
with
that
holding.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
that
is
correct.
it's
clearly
not
--
the
state
is
clearly
not
the
real
party
in
interest
in
this
case.
turning
next
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
they
have
long
been
held
to
be
citizens
of
a
state
for
diversity
jurisdiction
purposes
and
the
most
recent
enunciation
by
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
that
counties
are
quasi
corporations
of
that
nature.
turning
next
to
the
civil
rights
act's
jurisdiction
aspect
of
our
appeal,
i
think,
you
have
to
take
it
step
by
step
and
the
first
question
is,
does
section
1983
allow
for
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior,
that's
the
first
basic
question.
if
one
was
to
look
at
hesselgesser
versus
reilly,
mcdaniel
v.
carroll,
lewis
versus
brautigam,
clearly,
it
seems
that
conceptually
there
is
such
allowance.
an
additional
case
which
i
would
add
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
but
which
specifically
discusses
this
point
is
a
case
called
hill
versus
toll,
320
f.
supp.
185,
at
pages
188
and
189
which
involved
pennsylvania
law.
and
briefly
the
court
there
addressed
itself
specifically
to
the
respondeat
superior
concept
and
said
in
essence
as
regards
to
this
case,
we
note
that
the
well
settled
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
is
not
expressly
abolished
by
section
1983,
nor
does
the
legislative
history
make
it
clear
that
congress
intended
the
doctrine
not
to
apply
to
section
1983.
further,
the
salutary
reason
for
the
doctrine’s
application,
the
common
law
torts,
i.e.,
the
furnishing
of
a
deep
pocket
from
which
a
claimant
can
collect,
argues
just
as
forcefully
for
its
application
to
the
cause
of
action
created
by
section
1983
and
conversely,
we
find
that
it
is
no
wise
less
appropriate
to
apply
respondeat
superior
to
section
1983
than
to
common
law
torts.
accordingly,
we
now
decide
consistent
with
the
traditional
injunction
that
remedial
statutes
are
to
receive
a
liberal
construction
that
respondeat
superior
is
impliedly
a
part
of
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
once
you
accept
that
premise,
you
next
look
to
the
source
of
that
vicarious
liability.
we
are
not
here
arguing
today,
that
the
source
of
that
liability
is
section
1983.
we
are
not
here
arguing
that
the
source
of
that
by
vicarious
liability
is
any
other
civil
rights
act,
federal
law,
rather
we
are
saying
the
source
of
that
vicarious
liability
is
the
california
tort
claims
act,
state
law.
just
as
the
source
of
the
sheriff's
vicarious
liability
in
hesselgesser,
the
sheriff
and
sheriff
madigan
(ph)
vicarious
liability
in
mcdaniel
and
the
sheriff's
vicarious
liability
in
lewis
were
state
law,
no
difference.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
to
my
knowledge,
no
case
has
been
cited
to
us
and
as
result
of
the
tort
claims
act,
the
law
says
the
county
can
sue
and
be
sued.
we
presume
that
when
it
says
the
county
can
sue,
it
means,
it
can
be
a
plaintiff,
as
well
as,
a
defendant.
specific
authorization
was
given
in
1963
by
the
california
law
for
that.
now
turning
then
to
the
source
of
liability,
two
rather
anomalous
results
would
occur
if
the
defendant’s
position
is
adopted
and
they
are
as
follows.
up
until
1963,
the
california
law
was
that
the
sheriff
was
vicariously
liable
for
the
torts
committed
by
his
deputy.
a
case
called
reynolds
versus
lerman,
138
cal.
app.
2d
586
specifically
held
that.
when
the
tort
claims
act
was
enacted
in
1963,
section
820.8
was
enacted
which
specifically
says
that
one
public
employee
cannot
be
vicariously
liable
for
the
acts
of
another
public
employee,
rather
it's
the
employing
public
entity.
now,
the
whole
policy
of
the
tort
claims
act
was
obviously
to
place
ultimate
financial
responsibility
where
it
could
best
be
realized
and
to
allow
the
party
injured
by
a
public
employee
opportunity
for
meaningful
redress.
yet,
if
we
adopt
the
defendant’s
position,
where
california
sought
to
increase
the
likelihood,
that
a
plaintiff
might
recover
for
the
wrongs
of
their
public
employee,
we
would
have
the
opposite
effect
in
this
case
because
we
would
say
in
essence
that
well,
he
could
have
sued
the
sheriff
vicariously
under
cases
such
as
we
have
discussed,
somehow
he
can't
sue
the
county.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
and
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
such
exception
that
would
apply.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
not
to
my
knowledge.
second,
the
logical
result
of
the
defendant’s
position
is
simply
not
only,
that
a
federal
court
cannot
impose
that
state
created
liability,
but
because
congress
did
not
intend
for
public
entities
to
bear
this
ultimate
liability
that
a
state
court
can't
even
impose
it
and
indeed,
a
state
can't
pass
such
a
law.
and
yet,
i
cannot
imagine
that
the
defendants
are
here
even
taking
the
position
that
california
as
a
matter
of
its
law
doesn't
have
authority,
power
or
what
have
you
to
pass
a
law
saying
that
its
public
entities
will
be
vicariously
liable
for
the
torts
of
their
employees,
including
civil
rights
act's
violations.
that's
a
state
law
determination.
that's
is
a
state
policy
determination.
and
the
only
next
question
then
becomes,
can
a
federal
court
also
impose
that
state
created
liability?
to
that,
we
look
to
1988
and
section
1343.
now,
1988
is
not
a
jurisdictional
section.
it
doesn't
create
any
cause
of
action,
it
doesn't
confer
any
jurisdiction.
title
28,
1343
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
and
in
the
words
that
i
believe,
any
act
of
congress
which
is
provided
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights.
looking
at
section
1988,
if
it's
not
an
act
of
congress,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
and
if
it
wasn't
designed
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights,
i
don't
know
what
it
was
passed
for.
it
clearly
falls
within
that
language
and
thus
there
is
no
violation
to
monroe,
to
1983
or
to
any
other
civil
rights
act
provision
by
saying
that
the
federal
court
can
utilize
1988
in
the
fashion
it
was
intended
and
have
jurisdiction
to
impose
that
state
created
liability.
this
then
brings
me
to
the
final
jurisdictional
contention
we
make,
and
which
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult.
that
is,
if
we
assume
arguendo
that
by
some
quirk
1988
doesn't
mean
what
it
says,
that
the
california
tort
claims
act
cannot
impose
this
vicarious
liability,
but
can
at
the
same
time
impose
vicarious
liability
for
the
state
battery
or
state
negligence,
wrongs
committed
by
the
public
employee.
can
the
county
be
joined
as
a
pendent
party
on
the
pendent
state
claims
that
are
otherwise
before
the
court?
now,
in
a
sense,
we
have
something
like
and
astor-honor
type
analysis
because
you
do
have
a
federal
statute
which
can
be
construed
along
with
pendent
jurisdiction
really
to
bring
about
the
result
of
joining
the
county.
but
taking
it
just
in
the
abstract
for
the
moment,
we're
concerned
here
with
the
concept
of
judicial
power,
not
discretion.
there
is
no
opinion
from
this
court
that
we
are
aware
of
that
has
precisely
discussed
the
joinder
of
a
pendent
party.
the
trend
since
gibbs
has
been
certainly
that
pendent
jurisdiction
can
be
utilized,
that
the
considerations
and
policy
which
led
to
its
liberalization
and
were
further
liberalized
in
rosado,
and
that
if
the
criteria
otherwise
available
for
pendent
jurisdiction,
there
was
at
least
the
power
to
join
a
pendent
--
perhaps
a
pendent
party.
now,
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth
and
eight
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
expressly
recognized
this
judicial
power.
the
sixth
circuit
by
implication
has
recognized
this
power,
yet
the
ninth
circuit
stands
alone.
it
is
the
only
circuit
to
our
knowledge
which
expressly
holds
that
pendent
jurisdiction
does
not
allow
for
the
joinder
of
parties,
only
claims.
taking
this
case
for
the
moment,
if
we
look
to
the
traditional
test,
does
the
claim
arise
out
of
the
nucleus
of
operative
fact,
clearly,
there
isn't
even
an
additional
fact
involved
with
respect
to
the
county’s
liability
because
it's
vicarious
and
the
dependent
solely
upon
that
liability
of
the
individuals.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
that's
not
correct.
diversity
is
only
in
moor.
one
must
get
to
civil
rights
act
jurisdiction
and/or
pendent
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
that
is
in
both.
pendent
jurisdiction,
if
we
are
correct
on
diversity
in
moor,
then
in
theory,
the
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
contention
and
the
pendent
party
jurisdiction
aspect
may
not
have
to
be
reached
although
there
would
be
an
open
question
as
to
whether
or
not
as
to
the
federal
causes
of
action,
if
the
county
was
joined
on
diversity,
it
could
--
there
would
still
potential
liability.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
rundle.
they
are
companion
cases
as
they
were
consolidated
for
appeal.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
with
the
possible
exception
of
1988,
the
civil
rights
act
because
the
diversity
jurisdiction
question
would
leave
open
whether
or
not
the
county
was
vicariously
liable
for
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
that's
correct
and
in
that
sense,
one
would
not
have
to
reach
it.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
neither
or
both,
the
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no.
they
are
separate
cases.
the
plaintiffs
in
rundle
are
california
citizens,
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
it
was
never
even
raised,
never
argued,
both
of
these
people
were
shot
at
the
same
time
in
same
place
and
perhaps
with
the
same
shot.
that's
why
the
two
cases
were
brought
together,
they
involved
all
of
the
same
issues
factually
with
respect
to
ultimate
liability.
the
only
distinction
that
moor
has
is
he
is
an
illinois
resident
and
as
a
result,
we
were
able
to
raise
the
diversity
jurisdiction
issue,
but
rundle
has
to
be
resolved
by
either
a
resolution
of
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
and/or
pendent
party
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
clearly,
if
we
decide
on
the
basis
–
well,
if
you
decide
that
there
is
a
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
civil
rights
acts,
then
you
really
don't
have
pendent
party
joinder
anymore,
you
just
have
traditional
pendent
jurisdiction
joinder
because
now
you
are
joining
claims
against
whom
you,
a
party
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
yes,
right.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
or
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
pardon?
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
to
bring
the
county,
correct.
there
are
pendent
state
claims
now
pending
against
the
deputy
and
the
other
individuals.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
one
would
think
you
would
clearly
have
the
state
law
claims.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
am
saying
as
follows.
in
this
order,
the
scope
of
the
civil
rights
act
covers
both
the
federal
and
state
claims.
there
is
no
dispute
that
it
covers
the
state
claims
and
for
some
unexplained
reason,
the
defendants
have
not
briefed
in
their
brief
to
the
court
any
argument
that
the
california
law
does
not
also
cover
the
federal
claims.
so,
perhaps
they
have
abandoned
that,
i
don't
know.
however,
true
pendent
party
joinder
in
one
sense
would
be
only
joining
the
county
on
the
pendent
state
law
claims
without
regard
to
the
federal
claims
because
once
you
say
that
the
county
also
has
vicarious
liability
for
the
federal
claims
then
i
think
you
clearly
within
19
--
you
have
to
deal
with
1988
and
then
you
get
into
an
independent
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
through
1343,
because
now
you
are
talking
about
imposing
a
vicarious
federal
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
oh!
i
have
had
everything
i
want.
whether
--
if
i
prevail
on
diversity
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
--
and
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction
or
pendent
party.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
it's
all
state
law
vicarious
liability
that's
being
imposed.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct,
if
i
could
get
the
county
into
the
case.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
theoretically
yes
because
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
on
the
civil
rights
act,
but
i
think
that
we
tried
to
explain
to
the
court
on
our
brief
that
given
the
nature
of
this
case
which
involves
federal
constitutional
rights.
if
there
is
a
type
of
case
that
really
should
be
brought
in
a
federal
court,
i
would
think
this
is
the
type
and
i
don't
think
--
and
i
think
it's
a
to
go
--
this
court
has
said
before
that
merely
because
you
can
go
to
the
state
court
isn't
grounds
for
denying
your
choice
for
a
federal
forum
for
a
adjudication
of
your
federal
constitutional
rights.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
but
i
might
have
been
similarly
thrown
out
of
the
state
court
altogether.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no
question
about
it.
if
we
concede
that
the
power
exists,
the
next
question
is
discretion.
however,
i
think
any
fair
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
will
show
that
it
never
reached
the
discretionary
aspect.
it
specifically
said,
the
issue
is
not
one
of
discretion,
but
rather
lack
of
power.
the
district
court
further
said,
it
intimates
no
view
on
how
he
would
decide
the
case,
if
he
was
possessed
of
the
power
but
because
of
hymer
versus
chai,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
which
specifically
said,
there
is
no
power
for
that
joinder,
the
district
court
never
reached
that.
there
would
not
be
discretion
however
with
respect
to
civil
rights
acts
jurisdiction,
if
we
are
correct.
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
let
me
correct
a
couple
of
points.
on
consolidation,
appendix
c
to
the
petitioner
will
show
how
the
case
has
became
consolidated.
they
were
consolidated
by
the
ninth
circuit
for
this
appeal
only.
they
have
never
been
consolidated
for
trial.
indeed,
at
one
point
we
tried
to
have
them
consolidated,
the
county
opposed
the
motion
for
consolidation.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
none
at
all.
rundle
must
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
rundle
will
stand
to
fall
on
the
civil
rights
acts
in
pendent
jurisdiction
or
points.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
oh!
no.
the
whole
concept
of
the
pendent
jurisdiction
implies
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
of
the
case
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
well,
except
in
courts
of
appeal,
i
am
sure
they
got
along
that
point
and
pendents
and
claims
of
citizens
of
the
same
states,
once
they
had
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
matter,
but
we
are
not
raising
that
at
all.
we
are
not
saying
that
rundle’s
is
a
pendent
case.
indeed,
the
injuries
are
different
and
the
case
will
be
tried
separately.
a
second
point
that
i
think
we
should
dispel
is
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
opinion
attached
to
our
replied
brief
which
is
the
latest
one
by
judge
peckam
(ph)
in
this
case,
you
will
see
that
the
discretion
area
x
is
not
even
an
issue.
the
court
has
completely
rejected
those
for
these
individuals.
number
three
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
at
the
moment,
that
is
correct
and
that
is
their
posture.
they
are
separate
cases
to
be
tried
separately.
they
have
not
been
consolidated
for
trial
or
for
any
other
purpose
except
this
appeal
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
order
at
our
request
to
bring
the
cases
on.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no
question
about
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no.
the
state
court
action,
your
honor,
was
filed
for
this
reason
in
15m
(ph)
jury
trial,
section
26
at
pages
617
and
618,
they
talked
about
a
chicago
practice.
because
of
monroe,
it
is
unclear
and
it
wasn't
clear
that
we
would
ultimately
be
successful
in
bringing
the
county
into
this
case,
for
that
reason
we
wanted
to
protect
our
client.
a
former
associate
of
ours
did
some
research
in
the
area
and
concluded
that
we
had
no
problem
as
to
diversity,
so
we
filed
the
moor
case
only
in
the
federal
court.
however,
because
of
the
unknown
factors
in
rundle,
we
filed
only
in
the
state
court.
for
the
past
three
years,
we
have
never
done
anything
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
only
in
rundle.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
and
that
we
have
never
done
anything
with
the
state
court
action
include
serving
it
until
about
a
month
ago
when
under
california
law,
if
a
case
is
not
served
within
three
years
of
filing,
it
is
automatically
dismissed.
in
the
federal
case,
we
have
taken
some
15
depositions,
had
extensive
discovery,
extensive
motions
we
have
--
the
federal
case
has
been
the
case
we
have
filed
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
right,
but
we
are
talking
about
rundle
because
it's
got
the
companion
state
case.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
would
hate
to
think
that
our
client
in
rundle
would
be
prejudiced
by
our
seeking
to
protect
him
and
to
obviate
the
very
thing
that
we
are
trying
to
obviate
having
to
go
two
courts
with
the
same
case.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
just
as
in
any
pendent
jurisdiction
case,
with
diversity
case
i
suppose,
sure,
we
had
that
option,
but
we
chose
the
federal
forum
because
we
felt
we
would
get
--
there
were
many
factors
which
dictated
our
going
into
the
federal
forum
and
i
would
--
jury,
they
were
balancing
factors.
you
could
get
to
trial
faster
in
federal
court
generally
than
in
the
state
court.
there
were
many
factors.
the
federal
judiciary
was
much
more
familiar
with
the
civil
rights
acts,
we
thought.
we
know
of
no
state
court
reported
opinions
construing
the
civil
rights
acts.
indeed,
if
one
look
at
the
opinions
of
judge
peckam
in
this
case
where
he
has
agreed
with
us
and
disagreed
with
us,
at
least
he
has
enunciated
some
pretty
extensive
opinions.
on
the
point
about
complicating
the
case
by
adding
the
county,
it's
just
a
fallacy.
the
same
defenses
which
were
available
to
the
county
are
available
to
the
individual
employee
defendants.
we
have
to
say,
it
is
by
our
right
to
sue
county
in
order
to
sue
the
individuals.
the
same
instructions
are
going
to
be
a
part
of
this
case.
and
with
respect
to
insurance,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
shows
that
these
employees
have
insurance
of
any
sort.
i
can
tell
you
as
a
fact
that
the
officer
that
shot
my
client
is
making
approximately
$8,000.00
a
year
and
doesn't
have
any
insurance
to
our
knowledge.
the
county
carries
insurance.
they
are
the
only
ones
we
know
that
carries
insurance
aside
from
sheriff
madigan
smaller
bond
of
some
25,000.00,
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
showing
that
these
defendants
are
financially
able
to
respond
to
the
kind
of
judgment
we
are
seeking
in
this
case,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
but
they
are
not.
no,
this
really
was
never
raised
as
a
point
and
indeed
i
think
common
sense
would
say
that
the
deep
pocket
in
this
case
is
unquestionably
the
county.
moreover,
under
california
law,
in
order
to
sue
other
county
--
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
i
think
that's
is
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no
and
perhaps
or
court
take
judicial
notice
on
it,
but
the
county
has
got
of
deeper
pocket
than
the
shot
--
the
deputy
who
shot
my
client.
however,
with
respect
to
another
important
reason
for
a
judgment
against
the
county,
in
california,
if
you
want
to
sue
other
counties
who
participated
in
a
particular
act,
you
must
get
a
judgment
against
one
county.
in
connection
with
the
people’s
park
disturbances,
there
were
a
number
of
counties
involved
in
that
situation.
only
if
we
procure
a
judgment
against
the
county
of
alameda
can
we
then
sue
this
other
counties
which
we
would
intend
to
do
and
finally,
on
congressional
intent,
i
have
found
nothing
that
even
remotely
indicates
that
congress
intended
not
only
not
to
impose
liability
as
a
result
of
the
sherman
amendment
debates,
not
only
did
not
intend
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
of
imposed
liability,
but
when
further
and
said,
we
intend
to
preclude
a
state
from
imposing
vicarious
liability
on
its
public
entities.
i
think
that
kind
of
congressional
intent
is
pure
fabrication,
it's
not
found
in
the
debates
and
it's
not
found
in
monroe.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
no,
monroe
says
and
monroe
is
concerned
only
with
1983
liability,
footnote
2
of
that
opinion
makes
clear
that's
the
only
section
that
was
before
the
court
and
the
court
held
that
on
the
basis
of
the
sherman
amendment
debates,
congress
did
not
intend
to
impose
liability
by
virtue
of
1983.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
it's
correct.
it
is
in
the
meeting
of
1983
for
purposes
of
imposing
federal
liability.
mr.
ronald
m.
greenberg
that's
not
our
position
here.
we
say
there
is
nothing
in
monroe
and
nothing
in
the
congressional
debates
or
any
other
place
that
we
know
off
which
says
that
congress
also
did
not
intended
to
preclude
a
state
as
a
matter
of
its
law
from
imposing
that
liability.
thank
you.
