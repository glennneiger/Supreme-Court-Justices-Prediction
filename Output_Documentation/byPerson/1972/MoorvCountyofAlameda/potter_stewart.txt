justice
potter
stewart
this
was
always
kind
of
an
off-hand
casual
way
i
gather,
the
ninth
circuit
originating
with
a
brief
opinion
by
the
late
district
judge
mathis
that
was
accepted
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
everything
else
was
built
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
cases
and
you
are
quite
correct
in
my
understanding
that
there
are
many
of
them
which
do
hold
that
a
county
is
a
citizen
for
diversity
purposes.
is
there
any
analysis
of
the
particular
relationship
between
the
county
and
the
state
in
the
--?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
either/or
in
your
view?
i
mean,
deciding
in
your
favor
on
one
of
those
that
would
give
you
all
the
relief
to
which
you
think
you
are
entitled?
justice
potter
stewart
you
already
have
the
party
in
your
1983
action?
justice
potter
stewart
to
bring
the
county
in?
justice
potter
stewart
to
bring
the
county
in?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
that
all
you
are
saying?
are
you
saying
that
you
can
join
the
federal
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
the
compensatory
damages
only?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
a
diversity
case,
at
least
my
understanding
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
diversity
jurisdiction,
all
of
the
plaintiffs
have
to
be
a
diverse
citizenship
from
all
of
the
defendants
and
once
you
have
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant
who
do
not
have
diverse
citizenship,
diversity
is
defeated,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
diversity
is
defeated,
isn't?
you
have
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant
from
the
same
state,
citizens
of
the
same
state,
then
you
don't
have
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far,
everything
you
have
told
us
about
california
counties,
i
think,
it
could
have
been
said
about
the
counties
in
any
state
that
i
know
about.
you
haven't
told
us
anything
that's
uniquely
characteristic
of
california
counties?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
sure
certainly
with
every
state,
but
the
states
i
am
familiar
with
are
just
as
you
told
is
california
in
creatures
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
because
as
soon
as
it
became
pendent,
they
are
no
longer
be
jurisdictional
of
the
federal
court,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
the
whole
concept
of
diversity
jurisdiction
is
that
all
appellees
are
of
diverse
in
citizenship
from
all
the
defendants,
and
if
they
are
not,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
found
the
decision
in
monroe
against
pape,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
the
court
also
say
that
a
city
was
not
a
person
within
the
meeting
of
1983?
justice
potter
stewart
