justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenberg,
is
it
your
position
that,
that
is
a
nationwide
rule
in
effect
that
regardless
of
the
relationship
of
a
county
to
a
particular
state,
it
should
be
one
rule
throughout
the
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
the
state
not
a
citizen
of
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
of
course,
that's
a
different
reason.
i
mean,
in
one
case
you
should
be
saying
there
is
an
affirmative
defense
based
on
the
eleventh
amendment,
in
the
other
case
you
are
saying
there
is
not
the
basic
prerequisite
for
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
in
substitution
for
liability
of
the
municipal
corporation
or
is
it
in
addition
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
why
the
county
is
joined
and
the
state
court
action.
i
take
it
is
a
proper
party
under
california
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
anybody
argue
the
strawbridge
against
curtiss
point
in
the
lower
court,
the
complete
diversity
of
plaintiffs
and
defendants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
a
county
put
up
part
of
the
judges
salary
or
is
coming
to
entirely
from
the
state?
