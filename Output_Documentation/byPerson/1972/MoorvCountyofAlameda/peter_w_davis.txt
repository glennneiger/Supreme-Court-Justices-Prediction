mr.
peter
w.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
analysis
of
this
issue
must
first
start
with
plaintiff’s
concessions
which
are
that
he
has
not
and
cannot
state
a
cause
of
action
against
the
county
of
alameda
under
any
federal
law.
he
is
only
asking
this
court
to
have
a
federal
court,
here
state
law,
california
causes
of
action
against
the
county
of
alameda
and
he
is
asking
the
court
for
an
expansion
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
three
regards.
he
is
asking
the
court
to
incorporate
an
entire
body
of
california
law
through
1988
and
then
pretend
that
that's
an
act
of
congress
within
the
meaning
of
section
1343.
he
is
asking
the
court
to
expand
the
concept
of
pendent
jurisdiction
to
bring
in
a
party
defendant
not
otherwise
before
the
court,
against
whom
no
federal
cause
of
action
has
been
stated,
just
because
there
was
a
related
cause
of
action
in
the
court
against
other
parties.
and
third
in
the
moor
case
only,
he
is
stating
that
there
is
diversity
jurisdiction
because
the
county
of
alameda
is
a
“citizen”
within
the
meaning
of
diversity
jurisdiction
section
1332.
taking
the
1988
argument
first
which
is
the
most
difficult
one,
i
think
that
there
are
at
least
three
major
objections
to
bringing
in
a
state
body
of
law
under
that
section
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
of
the
state
law
cause
of
action.
first
from
the
language
of
the
section
itself
and
from
the
report
of
decisions,
it
does
not
appear
that
section
1988
was
intended
to
create
a
cause
of
action,
in
fact
plaintiff
concedes
this,
or
intended
to
confer
a
jurisdiction
or
intended
to
do
anymore
really
than
provide
supplementary
damage
remedies
to
the
district
court
on
a
cause
of
action,
a
case
over
which
it
already
has
jurisdiction
against
the
party
over
which
it
already
has
jurisdiction.
and
the
language
of
the
section,
it
says
in
itself,
that
the
statutes
of
the
state
were
in
the
court
having
jurisdiction
of
such
civil
or
criminal
causes
held
shall
be
extended
to
and
govern
said
course
in
the
trial
and
disposition
of
the
cause.
we
submit
that
section
1988
should
not
be
used
to
wholesale
incorporate
state
law
causes
of
action
for
torts
of
any
kind
or
by
vicarious
responsibility.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
there
is
no
federal
course
of
action.
he
was
talking
about
bringing
in
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
and
they
have
admitted
that.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
right.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
i
am
saying
that
1343
requires
an
act
of
congress
and
that's
the
jurisdictional
statute
and
using
1988
to
incorporate
an
entire
body
of
state
laws,
is
not
an
act
of
congress,
it's
an
act
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
and
in
addition
to
that,
plaintiff
has
not
met
at
all
the
arguments
that
you
cannot
use
1983
simply
by
its
own
terms
where
there
is
an
adequate
remedy,
the
federal
remedy
is
adequate
and
you
cannot
use
it
to
bring
in
an
inconsistent
state
law
and
both
of
those
considerations
are
present
here.
as
has
been
pointed
in
our
brief
and
as
pointed
out
by
petitioner
in
his
brief,
what
california
did
in
this
case,
instead
of
providing
for
the
direct
liability
of
public
entities
in
this
type
of
situation
in
1983
suit,
they
said
that,
where
the
employee
requested,
the
county
must
defend
and
indemnify
the
employee
under
government
code
sections
825
and
895.
in
other
words,
it's
an
indirect
assumption
to
get
at
this
principle
of
deep
pocket,
if
you
will,
or
provide
a
responsible
defendant
and
that
has
been
done
in
this
case,
as
alleged.
the
county
is
conducting
the
defense
of
all
the
employees.
furthermore,
it's
also
pointed
out
the
employees
have
their
own
insurance
of
$200,000
or
more.
now,
the
argument
raised
here
has
been
that
the
employees
are
judgment
proof
and
i
submit
that
the
petitioners
have
been
less
candid
with
the
court
in
making
that
kind
of
an
insertion
because
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
individual
defendants
are
not
judgment
proof
in
any
sense
of
the
word
and
plaintiff’s
remedy
is
perfectly
adequate
under
section
1983,
1985,
1986
against
the
five
individual
defendants
and
that
precludes
application
of
state
law
under
section
1988.
furthermore,
it
has
been
held
in
monroe,
the
legislature
when
it
passed
the
1871
act
intended
to
exclude
public
entities.
now,
the
argument
is
made
here
that
well,
if
the
1871
congress
were
transported
to
the
21
century
or
the
20th
century
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
some
municipalities
and
states
have
conditionally
waved
sovereign
immunity,
they
would
have
intended
something
different
or
pass
a
different
act
but
that's
not
the
point.
as
was
held
in
ries
versus
lynskey,
what
we
are
looking
at
is
what
they
intended
at
that
time
and
they
intended
at
that
time
to
exclude
public
entities.
there
motive
in
doing
so
is
not
relevant
to
statutory
interpretation.
and
you
get
points
very
clearly
established
in
monroe
and
i
think
it's
binding
here.
to
bring
in
then
the
public
entity
through
1988
is
interrogation
of
the
in
derogation
of
congress.
it's
clearly
against
what
congress
said
they
wanted
to
do
at
that
time,
that
is
exclude
public
entities.
and
for
that
reason
also,
then
1988
could
not
be
used
to
incorporate
this
body
of
state
law
and
i
would
refer
the
court
also
to
the
brief
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
a
related
case
of
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
which
is
recently
reversed
by
this
court.
we
discussed
in
some
length
the
motives
of
the
congress
and
there
are
several
references
there.
i
did
not
brief
this
at
length
because
it
was
in
his
brief
and
i
didn't
want
to
duplicate
it.
finally,
i
would
point
that
monroe
has
been
on
the
books
for
something
like
12
years
now
and
in
the
interim,
congress
has
enacted
several
major
civil
right
legislations
and
has
not
changed
to
rule
and
they
have
been
asked
to
do
so
and
i
think
that
is
indicative
of
the
situation.
i
don't
think
this
court
should
now
try
and
change
the
rules
of
municipal
liability
in
civil
right
actions,
if
congress
wants
to
do
so
and
that's
up
to
them.
alright
second
--
as
to
the
issue
of
--
well,
i
should
point
that
one
other
thing.
there
really
isn't
reason
to
make
this
kind
of
a
change.
plaintiff
not
only
has
a
remedy
in
state
court,
he
has
acted
on
it.
there
is
a
case
pending
in
the
state
court
with
the
identical
issues.
in
fact,
the
complaint
is
identical,
it's
been
answered,
it's
at
issue.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
same
defendants.
the
five
individuals
in
the
county
of
alameda.
that's
pending
in
the
state.
that
is
not
theoretical
remedy
at
all.
that's
very
practical
remedy
which
he
has
taken
advantage
of.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
rundle.
plaintiff
moor
filed
a
claim,
but
maybe
due
to
small
size
of
the
case,
did
not
file
a
complaint.
under
california
law,
you
have
to
file
a
claim
first
and
then
file
a
complaint
after
it
is
denied,
if
it
is
and
that
was
done
in
both
cases,
but
a
complaint
was
only
filed
on
behalf
of
one
of
two
defendants
or
plaintiffs.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct
under
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
outside
of
the
record,
all
of
the
individual
defendants
are
individually
insured
for,
i
believe,
it's
200,000
for
one
injury
and
500,000
or
800,000
for
all
injuries.
there
is
an
individual
insurance
applicable
to
all
of
them
and
that
is
in
addition
to
the
county
having
to
indemnify
and
defend
the
employees
when
they
are
requested
to
do
so.
now
this
does
not
apply
to
punitive
of
damages.
this
is
to
compensatory
damages
also
and
as
to
the
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes.
typically,
this
rule
does
not
apply
to
punitive
damages
under
the
california
tort
claims
act
of
states.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
in
the
case
of
a
federal
civil
rights
act,
i
would
take
the
position
that
it's
in
substitution
for
it.
in
the
case
of
an
act
under
the
california
tort
claims
act,
it's
in
addition
to
it.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
he
is
sued
in
california
under
california
tort
claims
act
and
joined
the
county.
now
there
are
some
issues
as
to
whether
the
county
is
responsible
directly
under
the
civil
rights
action
and
state
action,
but
since
the
county
is
a
party
anyway
under
the
state
action,
it
makes
no
practical
difference
and
that
issue
has
not
been
asserted
by
the
county
so
far,
because
it
is
a
practically
of
no
significance
at
all.
the
other
thing
i
think
is
appropriate
to
point
out
is
that,
as
been
discussed
before,
it
makes
more
sense
in
a
lot
of
ways
to
go
out
the
indirect
assumption
of
liability
and
require
in
federal
civil
rights
cases
that
the
individual
employees
be
located
and
served.
now,
in
my
own
experience,
i
found
us
to
be
true
and
this
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
in
reis
versus
lynskey
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
when
you
bring
in
an
individual
defendant
and
then
you
make
him
a
defendant
and
then
you
take
his
deposition
and
you
make
him
attend
the
trial,
it
has
a
very
profound
effect
on
you
and
it
has
a
very
sobering
effect
on
you,
win
or
loose.
whereas,
if
you
allow
plaintiffs
to
sue
in
amorphous
public
entity,
the
individual
employees
do
not
seem
to
feel
so
responsible
for
their
own
actions
that
there
is
somebody
out
there
that's
going
to
take
care
of
this,
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
well,
that's
also
possible,
but
as
a
practical
matter
if
you
allow
suit
against
the
public
entity,
you
don't
get
suits
against
the
individuals
offer.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
in
this
particular
case,
they
are,
but
in
many,
many
cases,
they
are
not.
we
can
sue
the
county.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no.
it's
specifically
excluded
under
section
8-18
and
it's
like
government
code.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
in
the
tort,
that's
part
of
the
tort
claims
act,
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
the
feeling
being
that
punitive
damages
are
not
to
compensate,
but
to
punish
and
that
the
individual,
they
wouldn't
punish,
unless
the
individual
defendant
himself
feels
some.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
be
rewarded
against
to
him
individually.
to
answer
one
your
earlier
questions,
however,
chief
justice
burger,
there
is
a
discretionary
immunity
section
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
sorry.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
sorry.
there
is
a
discretionary
immunity
section
in
the
tort
claims
act
being
government
code
section
820.2
in
response
to
your
earlier
question,
mr.
greenberg
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
in
this
case,
no.
but
i
do
suggest
that
it
relates
--
it
does
reach
a
considerable
amount
of
the
claims
against
the
superior
officers.
one
final
issue
on
this
point
and
that
is
whether
california
does
provide
a
direct
right
of
action.
and
i
think
that
it
can
most
clearly
be
seen
that
it
does
not
by
reference
to
the
california
law
revision
commission
statement
which
was
referred
to
by
plaintiff
in
his
brief.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
it
makes
a
difference
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
if
i
may
though,
mr.
justice
white
read,
the
issue
relevant
to
the
present
study
of
course
is
whether
public
entities
not
withstanding
their
immunity
from
direct
liability
under
the
civil
rights
act
should
assume
financial
responsibility
(whether
through
payment
of
insurance
premiums
to
protect
their
personnel
or
through
assumption
of
payments
of
judgments
against
such
personnel)
for
violations
by
their
police
officers
of
that
act.
by
analogy
the
suggestions
offered
earlier
i
just
believe
that
considerations
should
be
given
to
adoption
of
statutory
procedures
under
which
entities
in
california
would
be
required
to
resume
--
to
assume
ultimate
financial
responsibility
for
such
torts
to
their
police
officers
and
as
precisely
what
they
did
under
section
825
and
895.
now
plaintiff
says,
they
did
not
specifically
exclude
1983
actions,
which
you
have
to
recall
and
this
is
the
wake
of
monroe
versus
pape
and
as
they
discussed
there,
the
legislature
knew
they
were
already
excluded.
there
wasn't
any
reason
to
make
a
super
or
an
extra
exclusion
for
that
point.
and
what
did
they
do
is
provide
through
825
and
895
to
defend
and
indemnify
in
such
actions
instead
of
having
the
public
entity
a
direct
defendant
in
the
federal
court.
there
is
also
the
point
present
here
that
putting
the
action
--
putting
the
public
entity
directly
into
a
federal
1983
action
would
seriously
complicate
the
jury
instructions,
i
believe,
that
would
be
present
in
the
case.
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
large
number
of
defenses
and
immunities
that
are
applicable
under
the
california
action
which
then
would
become
present
in
the
federal
case
as
to
the
entity.
now
petitioner
properly
points
out
that
under
the
pendent
jurisdiction
claims
against
the
employee,
some
but
not
all
of
these
defenses
would
be
present
anyway.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
going
to
have
a
situation
where
you
are
going
to
tell
a
jury
that
as
to
the
federal
causes
of
action,
you
have
these
three
defenses
applicable
and
as
to
the
state
law
causes
of
action,
you
have
these
4
-
5
others
applicable,
as
to
the
employees,
but
as
to
the
public
entity,
you
have
six
others
applicable
whether
it's
a
state
law
or
federal
law
cause
of
action
and
then
you
are
going
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
public
entity
can
only
be
held
liable
vicariously
through
the
state
and
the
jury
is
going
to
say,
what
are
you
trying
to
say?
it's
a
ridiculous
situation
and
it's
an
unnecessary
situation
to
overly
complicate
the
case.
i
feel
that
given
--
a
jury
given
that
kind
of
instructions
cannot
possibly
follow
the
law.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that
would
also
be
an
argument
addressed
to
the
discretion
issue
on
the
pendent
parties,
but
i
think
it
is
an
argument
that's
present
here
when
the
plaintiff
says
he
wants
to
bring
in
a
state
law
of
causes
of
action
wholesale
through
1988.
i
think
it
is
not
only
unnecessary,
but
it's
unwise.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
diversity
is
a
problem.
i
think
logically
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
i
think
logically,
as
pointed
out
by
the
constitution
statutes
of
the
state
and
by
the
county
of
morin
case
cited,
a
county
is
simply
a
public
--.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that
is
close
to
the
situation
in
hatridge.
you
mean,
if
the
county
is
properly
in
the
moor
case,
under
diversity,
are
they
then
pendent
because
the
cases
are
consolidated
and
i
agree
that
makes
a
much
tougher
case.
it's
one
that
thought
about.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes,
i
would
take
the
position
that
even
though
it
makes
more
sense
in
that
situation
than
in
the
instant
situation,
i
think
that
it's
still
is
an
extension
of
pendent
jurisdiction
which
is
not
authorized.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
pendent
question
correct,
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
you
would
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
power
in
any
event.
as
to
whether
there
is
discretion,
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
as
a
matter
of
discretion
they
would
keep
it
out
clearly
and
they
also
indicated,
they
felt
the
district
court
thought
that
it
should
carried
out
not
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
there
are
separate
suits,
but
they
have
been
consolidated.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that
point
has
not
been
argued,
but
it
makes
sense
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
--
to
me
and
i
agree
with
it
that
if
the
cases
are
consolidated,
then
there
would
not
be
complete
diversity
since
once
requires
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
well,
these
work
all
are
assigned
under
the
related
case
rule
to
the
same
judge.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no,
but
that's
not
--
i
believe
the
cases
were
also
consolidated.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
am
a
little
shaky
on
the
record,
but
i
believe
that
it
was
a
motion
of
plaintiff.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
federal
jurisdiction
is
limited
and
if
the
case
falls
within
or
without
the
preview
of
the
jurisdictional
statutes,
the
chips
have
to
fall
as
they
may.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
conceptually,
i
don't
know
what
the
difference
is
between
two
individual
actions
with
identical
complains
except
for
the
diversity
point
in
one
which
are
consolidated
and
one
complaint
that
has
both
in
it
and
under
the
live
situation
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
consolidated
in
one
action
with
two
separate
complaints
which
say
the
same
thing.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
is
it
really
conceptually
different
as
a
practical
matter
than
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
technically,
i
think
that
they
are
except
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
think
in
your
point
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
mr.
justice
white,
yes,
that's
very
true.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
on
the
consolidated
issue,
no.
but
of
course
jurisdiction
can
be
raised
at
any
point
and
could
be
raised
by
this
court.
on
the
pendent
jurisdiction
point
again,
i
think
that
again
we
have
to
start
with
the
rather
axiomatic
problem.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
think
that
in
california,
whatever
the
situation
might
be
in
other
states,
the
california
law
makes
it
clear
that
a
california
county
is
simply
a
subdivision
of
the
state
and
has
whatever
powers
the
state
delegates
to
it.
now
as
against
the
state,
the
county
has
no
powers
whatsoever,
as
has
been
made
clear
in
the
cases
cited.
in
other
words,
if
the
state
wants
to
take
property
away
from
a
county,
they
just
simply
do
it,
no
compensation,
nothing.
as
to
third
parties,
the
county
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
state
and
that's
also
in
the
cases
that
for
example,
in
the
one
case
mentioned,
the
county
took
some
action
which
should
properly
have
been
taken
by
the
state
and
the
court
said,
no,
the
county
is
simply
an
agent
of
state,
stands
in
the
state
shoes
and
is
perfectly
capable
of
taking
this
action.
now
when
you
are
talking
about
citizenship,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
under
1332
and
i
would
oppose
that
to
the
concept
of
state
as
in
the
eleventh
amendment,
i
think
this
is
something
different.
i
fail
to
see
how
you
can
say
that
a
county
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
under
those
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
make
some
basic
divisions
between
government
and
citizens
and
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
given
to
citizens
like
the
power
to
hold
property
and
like
the
power
to
vote
are
not
in
the
county
under
any
stretch
the
imagination.
now,
the
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no,
not
as
to
the
city.
the
cities
are
different.
cities
are
entirely
different
in
california
than
counties.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
think
it
must
be.
at
least
in
this
case,
all
of
these
arguments
were
presented
to
the
court
and
they
refused
to
change
their
earlier
ruling
and
insisted
that
california
county
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
makes
it
not
a
citizen
of
the
state.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
they
have
said
just
what
you
said.
they
have
not
gone
on
a
great
length
and
explained
why.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
plaintiff
has
pointed
out
authorities
to
the
effect
if
whether
it
is
a
citizen
or
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
a
state
law.
although
of
course,
you
look
very
properly
to
the
state
law
to
determine
that
question.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
not
sure
what
the
status
of
counties
in
other
states
is.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
decisions
i
have
read
haven't
given
any
great
analysis
to
this
either
including
cowles.
they
just
said,
they
look
at
some
language
like
corporate
and
that's
as
far
as
they
go
and
they
say,
okay,
it
must
be
a
citizen
because
a
corporation
is
the
citizen
and
i
find
that
i
think
a
little
more
analysis
is
in
order.
i
think
that
the
concept
of
a
citizen
could
apply
to
a
municipal
corporation.
i
don't
really
have
much
difficulty
with
that,
because
they
are
different,
they
are
not
a
subdivision
of
the
state.
they
are
a
corporation
which
it
does
govern,
but
they
hold
their
own
property,
they
have
their
own
rights.
a
county
does
not
have
that
in
california.
i
think
it's
a
different
entity
and
it
seems
to
me
logically
difficult.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
according
to
the
county
of
morin
case
it's
owned
by
the
state.
if
the
state
says,
that's
our
court
house,
we
are
going
to
sell
it
tomorrow,
we
can
do
it.
the
judges
are
state,
for
example.
they
are
not
--
it's
a
superior
court
in
and
for
the
county
of
alameda
and
they
are
called
alameda
county
superior
court
judges,
but
the
analysis
of
the
situation
indicates
that
they
are
state
judges.
they
are
paid
by
state
judiciary
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
cities
are
creatures
of
the
state
under
different
constitutional
provisions
and
under
different
legislating
provisions
and
they
have
different
powers
and
different
duties.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
do
not
think
not
in
the
same
sense
of
the
word,
no.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
not
sure
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
believe
that
they
are
--
i
was
told
that
they
were
paid
by
the
state.
i
haven't
really
researched
the
point,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
school
districts,
assuming
that
they
are
all
the
same
and
i
don't
know
that
would
be
again
a
legislative
creature
only
and
nothing
enacted
under
different
laws
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
--
and
probably
would
be
yes,
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
may
have
to
back
up
a
minute
on
that.
it
just
occurred
to
me,
there
are
two
or
three
city
and
counties
and
san
francisco
is
one
of
them.
so
san
francisco
happens
to
be
an
exception
that
comes
under
both.
in
this
case,
it's
not.
county
of
alameda
is
completely
separate
from
any
of
the
cities
and
municipalities
within
the
county.
i
believe
los
angeles
is
the
other.
as
to
the
other
rights
that
have
been
enumerated,
for
example
the
right
sue
or
be
sued,
the
state
has
the
identical
right.
i
don't
see
how
that
can
really
be
a
distinction
between
whether
you
are
citizen
or
not.
in
fact,
all
of
the
rights
that
are
talked
about
here
are
state
rights
that
are
delegated
to
the
county.
so
how
does
that
make
the
county
a
citizen
of
the
state?
i
feel
it
does
not.
on
the
pendent
point
then,
i
feel
that
there
is
a
major
difference
between
joining
causes
of
action
among
a
defendant
already
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction
and
between
bringing
in
the
defendant
into
the
federal
court
on
a
state
law
cause
of
action
when
there
is
no
congressional
or
constitutional
authority
to
bring
that
particular
defendant
in.
i
can
readily
appreciate
the
reasoning
in
gibbs
which
is
judicial
economy
and
expediency,
but
i
think
that
one
of
the
very
few
checks
on
the
federal
judiciary
today
is
the
power
of
congress
to
define
jurisdictional
limits
of
the
district
court
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
this
court
should
go
slow
in
extending
on
your
own
the
concept
of
jurisdiction
to
include
another
party
not
previously
in
front
of
the
court.
i
think
that
there
is
also
merit
to
mr.
shakman’s
argument
in
20
stanford
law
review
that
state
questions
should
be
left
to
the
state
courts
in
many
cases
and
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
chief
justice
burger
brought
up
to
this
questionnaire
immunity
point.
there
is
a
point
of
section
of
820.4,
of
the
government
code
which
says
there
is
no
liability
to
a
public
employee
in
exercising
due
care
in
the
enforcement
of
law
except
for
false
arrest
or
false
imprisonment.
i
think
that
these
are
questions,
are
difficult
questions
that
should
be
left
to
the
state
courts
and
not
to
the
federal
courts.
as
mr.
shakman
points
out
if
the
state
court
makes
an
error,
this
court
can
review
it.
if
the
federal
court
makes
an
error,
the
state
has
absolutely
no
opportunity
to
review
that
or
to
correct
the
error.
well,
i
think
there
are
some
very
good
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
extended
in
that
regard.
but
basically,
i
think
we
are
talking
about
a
separation
of
power
problem
and
i
think
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
draw
the
line
in
some
place
on
what
kinds
of
claims
can
be
brought
in
the
federal
court
when
there
is
no
congressional
authority
for
that
and
i
would
draw
the
line
here
when
you
are
talking
about
bringing
in
another
party
who
is
not
already
in
front
of
the
court
and
that's
the
situation
here.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
these
points
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
their
action
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
analysis
of
this
issue
must
first
start
with
plaintiff’s
concessions
which
are
that
he
has
not
and
cannot
state
a
cause
of
action
against
the
county
of
alameda
under
any
federal
law.
he
is
only
asking
this
court
to
have
a
federal
court,
here
state
law,
california
causes
of
action
against
the
county
of
alameda
and
he
is
asking
the
court
for
an
expansion
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
three
regards.
he
is
asking
the
court
to
incorporate
an
entire
body
of
california
law
through
1988
and
then
pretend
that
that's
an
act
of
congress
within
the
meaning
of
section
1343.
he
is
asking
the
court
to
expand
the
concept
of
pendent
jurisdiction
to
bring
in
a
party
defendant
not
otherwise
before
the
court,
against
whom
no
federal
cause
of
action
has
been
stated,
just
because
there
was
a
related
cause
of
action
in
the
court
against
other
parties.
and
third
in
the
moor
case
only,
he
is
stating
that
there
is
diversity
jurisdiction
because
the
county
of
alameda
is
a
“citizen”
within
the
meaning
of
diversity
jurisdiction
section
1332.
taking
the
1988
argument
first
which
is
the
most
difficult
one,
i
think
that
there
are
at
least
three
major
objections
to
bringing
in
a
state
body
of
law
under
that
section
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
of
the
state
law
cause
of
action.
first
from
the
language
of
the
section
itself
and
from
the
report
of
decisions,
it
does
not
appear
that
section
1988
was
intended
to
create
a
cause
of
action,
in
fact
plaintiff
concedes
this,
or
intended
to
confer
a
jurisdiction
or
intended
to
do
anymore
really
than
provide
supplementary
damage
remedies
to
the
district
court
on
a
cause
of
action,
a
case
over
which
it
already
has
jurisdiction
against
the
party
over
which
it
already
has
jurisdiction.
and
the
language
of
the
section,
it
says
in
itself,
that
the
statutes
of
the
state
were
in
the
court
having
jurisdiction
of
such
civil
or
criminal
causes
held
shall
be
extended
to
and
govern
said
course
in
the
trial
and
disposition
of
the
cause.
we
submit
that
section
1988
should
not
be
used
to
wholesale
incorporate
state
law
causes
of
action
for
torts
of
any
kind
or
by
vicarious
responsibility.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
there
is
no
federal
course
of
action.
he
was
talking
about
bringing
in
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
and
they
have
admitted
that.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
right.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
i
am
saying
that
1343
requires
an
act
of
congress
and
that's
the
jurisdictional
statute
and
using
1988
to
incorporate
an
entire
body
of
state
laws,
is
not
an
act
of
congress,
it's
an
act
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
and
in
addition
to
that,
plaintiff
has
not
met
at
all
the
arguments
that
you
cannot
use
1983
simply
by
its
own
terms
where
there
is
an
adequate
remedy,
the
federal
remedy
is
adequate
and
you
cannot
use
it
to
bring
in
an
inconsistent
state
law
and
both
of
those
considerations
are
present
here.
as
has
been
pointed
in
our
brief
and
as
pointed
out
by
petitioner
in
his
brief,
what
california
did
in
this
case,
instead
of
providing
for
the
direct
liability
of
public
entities
in
this
type
of
situation
in
1983
suit,
they
said
that,
where
the
employee
requested,
the
county
must
defend
and
indemnify
the
employee
under
government
code
sections
825
and
895.
in
other
words,
it's
an
indirect
assumption
to
get
at
this
principle
of
deep
pocket,
if
you
will,
or
provide
a
responsible
defendant
and
that
has
been
done
in
this
case,
as
alleged.
the
county
is
conducting
the
defense
of
all
the
employees.
furthermore,
it's
also
pointed
out
the
employees
have
their
own
insurance
of
$200,000
or
more.
now,
the
argument
raised
here
has
been
that
the
employees
are
judgment
proof
and
i
submit
that
the
petitioners
have
been
less
candid
with
the
court
in
making
that
kind
of
an
insertion
because
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
individual
defendants
are
not
judgment
proof
in
any
sense
of
the
word
and
plaintiff’s
remedy
is
perfectly
adequate
under
section
1983,
1985,
1986
against
the
five
individual
defendants
and
that
precludes
application
of
state
law
under
section
1988.
furthermore,
it
has
been
held
in
monroe,
the
legislature
when
it
passed
the
1871
act
intended
to
exclude
public
entities.
now,
the
argument
is
made
here
that
well,
if
the
1871
congress
were
transported
to
the
21
century
or
the
20th
century
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
some
municipalities
and
states
have
conditionally
waved
sovereign
immunity,
they
would
have
intended
something
different
or
pass
a
different
act
but
that's
not
the
point.
as
was
held
in
ries
versus
lynskey,
what
we
are
looking
at
is
what
they
intended
at
that
time
and
they
intended
at
that
time
to
exclude
public
entities.
there
motive
in
doing
so
is
not
relevant
to
statutory
interpretation.
and
you
get
points
very
clearly
established
in
monroe
and
i
think
it's
binding
here.
to
bring
in
then
the
public
entity
through
1988
is
interrogation
of
the
in
derogation
of
congress.
it's
clearly
against
what
congress
said
they
wanted
to
do
at
that
time,
that
is
exclude
public
entities.
and
for
that
reason
also,
then
1988
could
not
be
used
to
incorporate
this
body
of
state
law
and
i
would
refer
the
court
also
to
the
brief
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
a
related
case
of
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
which
is
recently
reversed
by
this
court.
we
discussed
in
some
length
the
motives
of
the
congress
and
there
are
several
references
there.
i
did
not
brief
this
at
length
because
it
was
in
his
brief
and
i
didn't
want
to
duplicate
it.
finally,
i
would
point
that
monroe
has
been
on
the
books
for
something
like
12
years
now
and
in
the
interim,
congress
has
enacted
several
major
civil
right
legislations
and
has
not
changed
to
rule
and
they
have
been
asked
to
do
so
and
i
think
that
is
indicative
of
the
situation.
i
don't
think
this
court
should
now
try
and
change
the
rules
of
municipal
liability
in
civil
right
actions,
if
congress
wants
to
do
so
and
that's
up
to
them.
alright
second
--
as
to
the
issue
of
--
well,
i
should
point
that
one
other
thing.
there
really
isn't
reason
to
make
this
kind
of
a
change.
plaintiff
not
only
has
a
remedy
in
state
court,
he
has
acted
on
it.
there
is
a
case
pending
in
the
state
court
with
the
identical
issues.
in
fact,
the
complaint
is
identical,
it's
been
answered,
it's
at
issue.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
same
defendants.
the
five
individuals
in
the
county
of
alameda.
that's
pending
in
the
state.
that
is
not
theoretical
remedy
at
all.
that's
very
practical
remedy
which
he
has
taken
advantage
of.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
rundle.
plaintiff
moor
filed
a
claim,
but
maybe
due
to
small
size
of
the
case,
did
not
file
a
complaint.
under
california
law,
you
have
to
file
a
claim
first
and
then
file
a
complaint
after
it
is
denied,
if
it
is
and
that
was
done
in
both
cases,
but
a
complaint
was
only
filed
on
behalf
of
one
of
two
defendants
or
plaintiffs.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct
under
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
outside
of
the
record,
all
of
the
individual
defendants
are
individually
insured
for,
i
believe,
it's
200,000
for
one
injury
and
500,000
or
800,000
for
all
injuries.
there
is
an
individual
insurance
applicable
to
all
of
them
and
that
is
in
addition
to
the
county
having
to
indemnify
and
defend
the
employees
when
they
are
requested
to
do
so.
now
this
does
not
apply
to
punitive
of
damages.
this
is
to
compensatory
damages
also
and
as
to
the
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes.
typically,
this
rule
does
not
apply
to
punitive
damages
under
the
california
tort
claims
act
of
states.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
in
the
case
of
a
federal
civil
rights
act,
i
would
take
the
position
that
it's
in
substitution
for
it.
in
the
case
of
an
act
under
the
california
tort
claims
act,
it's
in
addition
to
it.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
he
is
sued
in
california
under
california
tort
claims
act
and
joined
the
county.
now
there
are
some
issues
as
to
whether
the
county
is
responsible
directly
under
the
civil
rights
action
and
state
action,
but
since
the
county
is
a
party
anyway
under
the
state
action,
it
makes
no
practical
difference
and
that
issue
has
not
been
asserted
by
the
county
so
far,
because
it
is
a
practically
of
no
significance
at
all.
the
other
thing
i
think
is
appropriate
to
point
out
is
that,
as
been
discussed
before,
it
makes
more
sense
in
a
lot
of
ways
to
go
out
the
indirect
assumption
of
liability
and
require
in
federal
civil
rights
cases
that
the
individual
employees
be
located
and
served.
now,
in
my
own
experience,
i
found
us
to
be
true
and
this
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
in
reis
versus
lynskey
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
when
you
bring
in
an
individual
defendant
and
then
you
make
him
a
defendant
and
then
you
take
his
deposition
and
you
make
him
attend
the
trial,
it
has
a
very
profound
effect
on
you
and
it
has
a
very
sobering
effect
on
you,
win
or
loose.
whereas,
if
you
allow
plaintiffs
to
sue
in
amorphous
public
entity,
the
individual
employees
do
not
seem
to
feel
so
responsible
for
their
own
actions
that
there
is
somebody
out
there
that's
going
to
take
care
of
this,
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
well,
that's
also
possible,
but
as
a
practical
matter
if
you
allow
suit
against
the
public
entity,
you
don't
get
suits
against
the
individuals
offer.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
in
this
particular
case,
they
are,
but
in
many,
many
cases,
they
are
not.
we
can
sue
the
county.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no.
it's
specifically
excluded
under
section
8-18
and
it's
like
government
code.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
in
the
tort,
that's
part
of
the
tort
claims
act,
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
the
feeling
being
that
punitive
damages
are
not
to
compensate,
but
to
punish
and
that
the
individual,
they
wouldn't
punish,
unless
the
individual
defendant
himself
feels
some.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
be
rewarded
against
to
him
individually.
to
answer
one
your
earlier
questions,
however,
chief
justice
burger,
there
is
a
discretionary
immunity
section
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
sorry.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
sorry.
there
is
a
discretionary
immunity
section
in
the
tort
claims
act
being
government
code
section
820.2
in
response
to
your
earlier
question,
mr.
greenberg
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
in
this
case,
no.
but
i
do
suggest
that
it
relates
--
it
does
reach
a
considerable
amount
of
the
claims
against
the
superior
officers.
one
final
issue
on
this
point
and
that
is
whether
california
does
provide
a
direct
right
of
action.
and
i
think
that
it
can
most
clearly
be
seen
that
it
does
not
by
reference
to
the
california
law
revision
commission
statement
which
was
referred
to
by
plaintiff
in
his
brief.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
it
makes
a
difference
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
if
i
may
though,
mr.
justice
white
read,
the
issue
relevant
to
the
present
study
of
course
is
whether
public
entities
not
withstanding
their
immunity
from
direct
liability
under
the
civil
rights
act
should
assume
financial
responsibility
(whether
through
payment
of
insurance
premiums
to
protect
their
personnel
or
through
assumption
of
payments
of
judgments
against
such
personnel)
for
violations
by
their
police
officers
of
that
act.
by
analogy
the
suggestions
offered
earlier
i
just
believe
that
considerations
should
be
given
to
adoption
of
statutory
procedures
under
which
entities
in
california
would
be
required
to
resume
--
to
assume
ultimate
financial
responsibility
for
such
torts
to
their
police
officers
and
as
precisely
what
they
did
under
section
825
and
895.
now
plaintiff
says,
they
did
not
specifically
exclude
1983
actions,
which
you
have
to
recall
and
this
is
the
wake
of
monroe
versus
pape
and
as
they
discussed
there,
the
legislature
knew
they
were
already
excluded.
there
wasn't
any
reason
to
make
a
super
or
an
extra
exclusion
for
that
point.
and
what
did
they
do
is
provide
through
825
and
895
to
defend
and
indemnify
in
such
actions
instead
of
having
the
public
entity
a
direct
defendant
in
the
federal
court.
there
is
also
the
point
present
here
that
putting
the
action
--
putting
the
public
entity
directly
into
a
federal
1983
action
would
seriously
complicate
the
jury
instructions,
i
believe,
that
would
be
present
in
the
case.
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
large
number
of
defenses
and
immunities
that
are
applicable
under
the
california
action
which
then
would
become
present
in
the
federal
case
as
to
the
entity.
now
petitioner
properly
points
out
that
under
the
pendent
jurisdiction
claims
against
the
employee,
some
but
not
all
of
these
defenses
would
be
present
anyway.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
going
to
have
a
situation
where
you
are
going
to
tell
a
jury
that
as
to
the
federal
causes
of
action,
you
have
these
three
defenses
applicable
and
as
to
the
state
law
causes
of
action,
you
have
these
4
-
5
others
applicable,
as
to
the
employees,
but
as
to
the
public
entity,
you
have
six
others
applicable
whether
it's
a
state
law
or
federal
law
cause
of
action
and
then
you
are
going
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
public
entity
can
only
be
held
liable
vicariously
through
the
state
and
the
jury
is
going
to
say,
what
are
you
trying
to
say?
it's
a
ridiculous
situation
and
it's
an
unnecessary
situation
to
overly
complicate
the
case.
i
feel
that
given
--
a
jury
given
that
kind
of
instructions
cannot
possibly
follow
the
law.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that
would
also
be
an
argument
addressed
to
the
discretion
issue
on
the
pendent
parties,
but
i
think
it
is
an
argument
that's
present
here
when
the
plaintiff
says
he
wants
to
bring
in
a
state
law
of
causes
of
action
wholesale
through
1988.
i
think
it
is
not
only
unnecessary,
but
it's
unwise.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
diversity
is
a
problem.
i
think
logically
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
i
think
logically,
as
pointed
out
by
the
constitution
statutes
of
the
state
and
by
the
county
of
morin
case
cited,
a
county
is
simply
a
public
--.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that
is
close
to
the
situation
in
hatridge.
you
mean,
if
the
county
is
properly
in
the
moor
case,
under
diversity,
are
they
then
pendent
because
the
cases
are
consolidated
and
i
agree
that
makes
a
much
tougher
case.
it's
one
that
thought
about.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes,
i
would
take
the
position
that
even
though
it
makes
more
sense
in
that
situation
than
in
the
instant
situation,
i
think
that
it's
still
is
an
extension
of
pendent
jurisdiction
which
is
not
authorized.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
pendent
question
correct,
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
you
would
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
power
in
any
event.
as
to
whether
there
is
discretion,
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
as
a
matter
of
discretion
they
would
keep
it
out
clearly
and
they
also
indicated,
they
felt
the
district
court
thought
that
it
should
carried
out
not
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
there
are
separate
suits,
but
they
have
been
consolidated.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that
point
has
not
been
argued,
but
it
makes
sense
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
--
to
me
and
i
agree
with
it
that
if
the
cases
are
consolidated,
then
there
would
not
be
complete
diversity
since
once
requires
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
well,
these
work
all
are
assigned
under
the
related
case
rule
to
the
same
judge.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no,
but
that's
not
--
i
believe
the
cases
were
also
consolidated.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
am
a
little
shaky
on
the
record,
but
i
believe
that
it
was
a
motion
of
plaintiff.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
federal
jurisdiction
is
limited
and
if
the
case
falls
within
or
without
the
preview
of
the
jurisdictional
statutes,
the
chips
have
to
fall
as
they
may.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
conceptually,
i
don't
know
what
the
difference
is
between
two
individual
actions
with
identical
complains
except
for
the
diversity
point
in
one
which
are
consolidated
and
one
complaint
that
has
both
in
it
and
under
the
live
situation
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
consolidated
in
one
action
with
two
separate
complaints
which
say
the
same
thing.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
is
it
really
conceptually
different
as
a
practical
matter
than
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
technically,
i
think
that
they
are
except
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
think
in
your
point
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
mr.
justice
white,
yes,
that's
very
true.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
on
the
consolidated
issue,
no.
but
of
course
jurisdiction
can
be
raised
at
any
point
and
could
be
raised
by
this
court.
on
the
pendent
jurisdiction
point
again,
i
think
that
again
we
have
to
start
with
the
rather
axiomatic
problem.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
think
that
in
california,
whatever
the
situation
might
be
in
other
states,
the
california
law
makes
it
clear
that
a
california
county
is
simply
a
subdivision
of
the
state
and
has
whatever
powers
the
state
delegates
to
it.
now
as
against
the
state,
the
county
has
no
powers
whatsoever,
as
has
been
made
clear
in
the
cases
cited.
in
other
words,
if
the
state
wants
to
take
property
away
from
a
county,
they
just
simply
do
it,
no
compensation,
nothing.
as
to
third
parties,
the
county
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
state
and
that's
also
in
the
cases
that
for
example,
in
the
one
case
mentioned,
the
county
took
some
action
which
should
properly
have
been
taken
by
the
state
and
the
court
said,
no,
the
county
is
simply
an
agent
of
state,
stands
in
the
state
shoes
and
is
perfectly
capable
of
taking
this
action.
now
when
you
are
talking
about
citizenship,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
under
1332
and
i
would
oppose
that
to
the
concept
of
state
as
in
the
eleventh
amendment,
i
think
this
is
something
different.
i
fail
to
see
how
you
can
say
that
a
county
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
under
those
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
make
some
basic
divisions
between
government
and
citizens
and
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
given
to
citizens
like
the
power
to
hold
property
and
like
the
power
to
vote
are
not
in
the
county
under
any
stretch
the
imagination.
now,
the
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
no,
not
as
to
the
city.
the
cities
are
different.
cities
are
entirely
different
in
california
than
counties.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
think
it
must
be.
at
least
in
this
case,
all
of
these
arguments
were
presented
to
the
court
and
they
refused
to
change
their
earlier
ruling
and
insisted
that
california
county
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
makes
it
not
a
citizen
of
the
state.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
they
have
said
just
what
you
said.
they
have
not
gone
on
a
great
length
and
explained
why.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
plaintiff
has
pointed
out
authorities
to
the
effect
if
whether
it
is
a
citizen
or
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
a
state
law.
although
of
course,
you
look
very
properly
to
the
state
law
to
determine
that
question.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
not
sure
what
the
status
of
counties
in
other
states
is.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
decisions
i
have
read
haven't
given
any
great
analysis
to
this
either
including
cowles.
they
just
said,
they
look
at
some
language
like
corporate
and
that's
as
far
as
they
go
and
they
say,
okay,
it
must
be
a
citizen
because
a
corporation
is
the
citizen
and
i
find
that
i
think
a
little
more
analysis
is
in
order.
i
think
that
the
concept
of
a
citizen
could
apply
to
a
municipal
corporation.
i
don't
really
have
much
difficulty
with
that,
because
they
are
different,
they
are
not
a
subdivision
of
the
state.
they
are
a
corporation
which
it
does
govern,
but
they
hold
their
own
property,
they
have
their
own
rights.
a
county
does
not
have
that
in
california.
i
think
it's
a
different
entity
and
it
seems
to
me
logically
difficult.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
according
to
the
county
of
morin
case
it's
owned
by
the
state.
if
the
state
says,
that's
our
court
house,
we
are
going
to
sell
it
tomorrow,
we
can
do
it.
the
judges
are
state,
for
example.
they
are
not
--
it's
a
superior
court
in
and
for
the
county
of
alameda
and
they
are
called
alameda
county
superior
court
judges,
but
the
analysis
of
the
situation
indicates
that
they
are
state
judges.
they
are
paid
by
state
judiciary
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
cities
are
creatures
of
the
state
under
different
constitutional
provisions
and
under
different
legislating
provisions
and
they
have
different
powers
and
different
duties.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
do
not
think
not
in
the
same
sense
of
the
word,
no.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
am
not
sure
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
believe
that
they
are
--
i
was
told
that
they
were
paid
by
the
state.
i
haven't
really
researched
the
point,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
the
school
districts,
assuming
that
they
are
all
the
same
and
i
don't
know
that
would
be
again
a
legislative
creature
only
and
nothing
enacted
under
different
laws
--
mr.
peter
w.
davis
--
and
probably
would
be
yes,
yes.
mr.
peter
w.
davis
i
may
have
to
back
up
a
minute
on
that.
it
just
occurred
to
me,
there
are
two
or
three
city
and
counties
and
san
francisco
is
one
of
them.
so
san
francisco
happens
to
be
an
exception
that
comes
under
both.
in
this
case,
it's
not.
county
of
alameda
is
completely
separate
from
any
of
the
cities
and
municipalities
within
the
county.
i
believe
los
angeles
is
the
other.
as
to
the
other
rights
that
have
been
enumerated,
for
example
the
right
sue
or
be
sued,
the
state
has
the
identical
right.
i
don't
see
how
that
can
really
be
a
distinction
between
whether
you
are
citizen
or
not.
in
fact,
all
of
the
rights
that
are
talked
about
here
are
state
rights
that
are
delegated
to
the
county.
so
how
does
that
make
the
county
a
citizen
of
the
state?
i
feel
it
does
not.
on
the
pendent
point
then,
i
feel
that
there
is
a
major
difference
between
joining
causes
of
action
among
a
defendant
already
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction
and
between
bringing
in
the
defendant
into
the
federal
court
on
a
state
law
cause
of
action
when
there
is
no
congressional
or
constitutional
authority
to
bring
that
particular
defendant
in.
i
can
readily
appreciate
the
reasoning
in
gibbs
which
is
judicial
economy
and
expediency,
but
i
think
that
one
of
the
very
few
checks
on
the
federal
judiciary
today
is
the
power
of
congress
to
define
jurisdictional
limits
of
the
district
court
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
this
court
should
go
slow
in
extending
on
your
own
the
concept
of
jurisdiction
to
include
another
party
not
previously
in
front
of
the
court.
i
think
that
there
is
also
merit
to
mr.
shakman’s
argument
in
20
stanford
law
review
that
state
questions
should
be
left
to
the
state
courts
in
many
cases
and
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
chief
justice
burger
brought
up
to
this
questionnaire
immunity
point.
there
is
a
point
of
section
of
820.4,
of
the
government
code
which
says
there
is
no
liability
to
a
public
employee
in
exercising
due
care
in
the
enforcement
of
law
except
for
false
arrest
or
false
imprisonment.
i
think
that
these
are
questions,
are
difficult
questions
that
should
be
left
to
the
state
courts
and
not
to
the
federal
courts.
as
mr.
shakman
points
out
if
the
state
court
makes
an
error,
this
court
can
review
it.
if
the
federal
court
makes
an
error,
the
state
has
absolutely
no
opportunity
to
review
that
or
to
correct
the
error.
well,
i
think
there
are
some
very
good
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
extended
in
that
regard.
but
basically,
i
think
we
are
talking
about
a
separation
of
power
problem
and
i
think
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
draw
the
line
in
some
place
on
what
kinds
of
claims
can
be
brought
in
the
federal
court
when
there
is
no
congressional
authority
for
that
and
i
would
draw
the
line
here
when
you
are
talking
about
bringing
in
another
party
who
is
not
already
in
front
of
the
court
and
that's
the
situation
here.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
these
points
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
their
action
should
be
affirmed.
