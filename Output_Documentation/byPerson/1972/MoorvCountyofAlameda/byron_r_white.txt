you
say
the
state
is
--
part
of
your
assertion
is
that
the
county
is
not
equivalent
to
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
is
a
subdivision
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
in
california
cases
that
rule
over
that
the
--
that
also,
that
the
county
may
not
be
a
plaintiff.
it
must
be
for
purposes
of
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
also,
there
is
no
possibility
about
the
kind
of
diversity
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
just
saying
you
can
join
a
party
through
pendent
jurisdiction,
that
tells
us
what
kind
of
a
claim
that
party
might
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
federal
cause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
who
is
the
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
leaves
an
alternative
to
be
invoked
and
achieving
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
they
presented
right
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
so
far,
does
it
make
any
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
(inaudible)
with
respect
to
moor?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
agree,
it's
not
a
question
of
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
it
straight.
if
their
claim
is
diversity
here
with
respect
to
moor
and
assume
that
the
you
won
in
rundle,
would
rundle’s
case
be
pendent
to
moor?
your
argument
will
take
care
that
to
i
suppose,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
are
wrong
on
diversity
then
this
--
do
we
have
to
face
up
to
the
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
separate
suits
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
mean,
you
destroy
federal
constitution.
you
would
throw
the
the
case
out
on
diversity
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
neither
party
--
neither
party
broke
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
court
permits
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
related,
that
means
in
every
county
they
are
related
case
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
maybe
so
but
if
i
want
to
come
in
and
say
i
am
pendent
and
said
i
want
to
be
part
of
this
law
suit,
that's
is
different,
isn't?
then
you
are
in
one
law
suit.
is
that
what
question
of
your
consolidation,
you
are
trying
--
you
are
claiming
that
you
are
pendent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
this
is
unique
to
california
county,
and
do
you
think
that
this
is
behind
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit’s
decisions
in
this
area
even
though
not
articulated?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
cities
are
not
creatures
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
your
school
districts
citizen
for
purpose
of
the
diversity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
byron

so
there
is
no
claim
(inaudible)
here
that
if
moor
is
a
diversity
case,
rundle
is
pendent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
make
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
it
done
on
basis
of
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
that
counties
are
usually
richer
than
anybody,
any
individual?
justice
