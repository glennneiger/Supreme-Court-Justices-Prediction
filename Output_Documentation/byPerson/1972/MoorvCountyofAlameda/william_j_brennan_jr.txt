justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
are
right
your
diversity
jurisdiction
point,
we
don't
reach
this,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
was
thinking
about
the
pendent
jurisdiction
argument.
that's
only
in
moor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
other
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
say
again,
if
you
were
right
on
your
diversity
point
and
then
you
don't
have
to
reach
any
other
questions
in
moor,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
small
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
unless
it
was
the
action.
now,
what
would
we
have
to
reach
in
rundle,
assuming
we
agree
with
you
on
your
diversity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
finding
a
diversity
jurisdiction
in
moor,
doesn't
answer
either
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
must
be
suggesting,
you
have
to
reach
in
rundle,
the
pendent
party
if
you
treat
moor
as
proper
diversity
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
have
to
get
to
the
pendent
party
to
bring
rundle
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
you
lose
out,
if
you
lost
out
on
the
1988?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
what
i
don't
understand,
mr.
greenberg,
if
you
prevail
in
moor
on
the
diversity
point
and
also
prevail
on
the
pendent
party
claim,
why
haven't
you
got
everything
you
want?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
the
pendent
party
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know,
pendent
party
only.
i
am
asking
you,
if
you
prevail
on
diversity
and
your
pendent
party
point
what
more
do
you
want?
why
do
you
have
to
have
civil
rights
jurisdiction?
you
have
got
state
law
then,
don't
you,
vicarious
liability?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
don't
you
have
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
argument
i
take
it
that
under
1983,
in
light
of
monroe
and
pape,
there
could
be
no
action
against
the
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore,
since
there
is
no
jurisdiction
over
the
proceeding
against
the
county,
you
can't
bring
in
1988
to
infuse
california
law,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
no
federal
cause
of
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
what
he
says
there
is
no
federal
cause
of
action
in
the
1983
against
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
under
monroe
and
pape.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
argument
probably
is
that
therefore
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
required
by
1988
before
you
can
go
on
to
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
is
the
defendant
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
under
the
liability
act
applicable
to
municipalities
and
counties?
you
have
to
file
a
claim
first
before
you
sue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
tort
claims
act,
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
let's
see,
this
is
an
argument
addressed
to
the
second
point
of
pendent
parties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
the
discretionary
sense.
what
we
decide
that
here?
if
you
are
wrong
on
diversity,
should
we
decide
the
pendent
question
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
should
we
decide
it
here
or
should
we
send
it
back,
if
you
are
wrong
on
diversity?
should
we
send
it
back
and
let
the
court
below
decide
it
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
this
argument
as
to
is
in
san
francisco?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
have
they
are
ever
articulated
this
as
well?
as
i
understand
your
argument,
your
major
premise
is
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
state
of
california
and
its
counties.
whatever
it
might
be
the
other
way
which
makes
the
county
simply
(inaudible)
to
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
alright,
not
a
citizen.
now
has
that
ever
been
said
by
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily,
of
course,
we
accept
here,
did
you
know,
what
a
court
of
appeal
says
is
the
state
law,
but
we
are
not
positioned
with
this
one
on
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
county
court
houses
in
the
california.
what
entity
owns
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
they
were
--
the
cities
are
incorporated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
counties
are
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
the
actions
pending
in
the
state
courts
are
also
to
be
tried
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
only
in
rundle
--
also?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
moor
is
--
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
mean
the
federal
cases?
there
are
two
federal
cases,
rundle
and
moor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
are
right
your
diversity
jurisdiction
point,
we
don't
reach
this,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
was
thinking
about
the
pendent
jurisdiction
argument.
that's
only
in
moor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
say
again,
if
you
were

on
your

then
you
don't

is
that

it's
a

justice
william
j.

no,

now,
what

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
you
lose

if
you
lost
out
on
the
1988?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
what
i
don't

mr.

if
you

i
am
asking
you,
if
you
prevail
on

what

why
