mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
to
a
couple
of
points
that
my
brother
gruis
raised
during
the
course
of
his
argument
and
one
was
that
the
question
as
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
was
first
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
it’s
relevant,
but
lest
it
may
seem
relevant
to
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
that
it
was
raised
--
i
could
find
at
least
two
places
in
the
record
where
it
as
raised
before
the
commission.
one
in
the
appendix
at
page
33
in
the
letter
from
the
applicant
to
the
commission,
the
applicant
for
approval
of
the
transaction.
in
the
second
paragraph
of
page
33,
the
applicant
says
that
they
have
been
advised
by
their
council,
i’m
skipping,
that
their
transaction
does
not
require
approval
by
the
commission.
nevertheless,
they
are
submitting
their
papers
for
approval
in
the
event
the
commission
should
differ
with
them.
so
that
i
think
it
was
there
clearly
raised
by
the
applicants,
the
question,
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
their
transaction.
again
your
honor,
i
find
that
on
page
52
of
the
appendix
in
footnote
one
where
the
applicants
again
say
we
preserve
our
position
that
the
pfel
oceanic
agreement
is
not
subject
to
section
15
of
the
shipping
act.
i
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference,
but
maybe
to
your
honors.
the
other
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
immediately
is
they
rather
lengthy
policy
argument
that
my
brother
gruis
made.
he
says
that
it
is
desirable
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
the
commission
be
given
the
jurisdiction
over
acquisitions
and
merger
agreements
because
he
says
that
the
commission
is
more
flexible
and
it
does
take
into
account
antitrust
considerations
in
its
decisions.
that
is
certainly
an
arguable
question
of
policy.
two
courts
differed
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
desirable.
judge
meryl
in
the
ninth
circuit
speaking
for
the
majority
of
his
panel,
thought
it
would
be
desirable,
on
the
other
hand
judge
wilkie
speaking
for
the
court
below
in
this
case
raised
question
as
to
whether
or
not
be
it
would
desirable,
but
that
your
honor
is
a
question
for
congress.
the
question
before
this
court
is,
whether
section
15
was
intended
to
grant
the
federal
maritime
commission
jurisdiction
over
mergers
and
acquisitions
and
that
is
the
question
your
honors
have
to
decide.
i
think
that
my
brother
gruis
was
assuming
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
and
was
pointing
out
how
good
it
is
and
how
desirable
it
is
that
they
should
have
it.
now,
the
shipping
act
does
not
provide
a
pervasive
regulatory
scheme
for
the
shipping
industry.
it
was
never
intended
to
do
that
and
it
doesn’t
do
it
today,
it
doesn’t
regulate
entry,
it
doesn’t
have
the
general
power
to
set
rates,
maximum-minimum
rates.
what
the
shipping
act
was
intended
to
do
was
to
place
under
government
supervision
the
practices
of
shipping
lines
which
banded
together
in
setting
up
trade
restraining
agreements
through
the
instrumentality
of
conferences.
these
are
associations
of
shipping
lines
and
essentially
that
was
what
was
intended
where
the
shipping
lines
worked
out
agreements
whereby
they
regulated
rates
among
themselves.
they
regulated
sailings,
they
allotted
ports,
and
it
was
that
type
of
trade
restraining
agreement
that
section
15
was
designed
to
cover.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
language
of
section
15
very
briefly.
while
i
think
it’s
inconclusive,
i
think
our
reading
of
section
15
is
more
reasonable
than
the
one
that
the
commission
suggests.
your
honors,
i
think
you’ll
find
the
pertinent
parts
of
that
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition.
it
reproduces
--
it’s
a
gray
covered
document
and
on
page
19,
it
reproduces
judge
wilkie’s
opinion
on
this
case
where
he
sets
forth
the
shipping
act
or
portions
of
it
as
it
was
originally
enacted.
i
don’t
think
any
pertinent
changes
were
made
in
1961
for
our
purposes.
one
page
19,
judge
wilkie
sets
forth
in
a
series
the
seven
categories
of
agreements
which
section
15
covers.
your
honors,
if
we
remove
the
middle
category
that
was
clause;
which
the
opinion
labels
clause
3,
and
on
which
my
brother
gruis
relies
principally,
that
is
the
category
of
agreements
controlling
preventing
and
so
forth
competition.
if
we
remove
that
for
a
moment
and
examine
all
the
other
categories,
the
first
is
an
agreement
fixing
rates,
(inaudible)
an
ongoing
type
of
agreement.
the
second
is
agreements
giving
special
rates
and
accommodations,
another
of
the
same
type.
now,
i
will
skip
the
third,
which
is
the
one
my
brother
gruis
relies
on.
the
fourth
are
agreements
pooling
or
apportioning
earnings,
again
an
agreement
of
an
ongoing
type
that’s
susceptible
to
continuing
supervision
by
the
agency.
the
fifth
are
agreements
allotting
ports
and
regulating
sailings,
again,
an
agreement
of
the
same
type.
the
sixth
are
agreements
regulating
the
volume
of
traffic,
again
these
are
ongoing,
agreements
of
an
ongoing
nature
and
then
finally,
the
last
is
a
catch
all
provision,
agreements
in
any
manner
providing
for
an
exclusive
preferential
or
cooperative
working
agreement.
now,
clearly,
those
five
agreements
are
all
of
the
same
type
as
the
one
in
the
final
clause.
they
are
all
the
--
they
are
specific
and
unambiguous
agreements
of
an
ongoing
nature
and
the
last
is
obviously
a
generalized
type
describing
the
same
type
of
agreements
that
were
previously
described.
it
seems
to
be
quite
reasonable
to
me.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
mean,
obviously
in
sense
of
generalized
rather
than
specific
your
honor.
that’s
what
i
meant
rather
than
--
what
i’m
suggesting
your
honor
is
not
that
the
language
is
conclusive.
i
am
suggesting
that
it's
fair
to
read
the
language
as
we
urge
rather
than
the
commission
urges
and
given
the
fact
that
the
language
on
which
it
relies
is
in
the
middle
of
the
specific
and
unambiguous
clauses
that
was
intended
to
be
of
the
same
type
as
the
other
clauses
immediately
preceding
it
and
following
it
and
that
the
last
clause,
the
generalized
clause
was
summarizing
the
kinds
of
agreements
that
preceded
it.
that
is
agreements,
trade
restraining
agreements,
agreements
of
an
ongoing
nature
which
are
susceptible
of
continuing
supervision
by
the
agency.
the
support
for
this
construction
is
provided
in
the
paragraphs
immediately
following.
i
will
take
one.
i
think
perhaps
we
can’t
dwell
on
this
too
long,
because
i
think
the
conclusive
answers
are
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
contemporaneous
and
subsequent
legislation
where
the
congress
was
very
explicit
when
it
wanted
to
give
an
agency
authority
over
acquisitions
and
mergers.
where
in
the
same
statute
the
congress
gave
the
agency
jurisdiction
over
agreements
in
one
clause
and
in
a
separate
clause,
specifically
addressed
itself
to
acquisitions
and
consolidation.
conceptually
congress
thought
of
them
as
being
of
a
different
breed
and
i
think
this
was
true
in
the
case
of
the
shipping
act.
in
the
paragraph
immediately
following
the
clauses,
i
just
quoted,
this
appears
on
page
20
of
the
appendix,
i’ll
take
one.
there
at
three
such
paragraphs
i
think,
one
would
be
sufficient
illustrate
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make.
it
provides
that
the
commission
may
disapprove
an
agreement,
i’m
skipping,
whether
or
not
previously
approved
by
it.
now,
i
think
that
an
acquisition
agreement
is
not
readily
susceptible
of
that
type
of
treatment,
that
is
once
it’s
consummated,
while
it’s
gone
and
has
disappeared
generally.
whereas
an
agreement
of
a
continuing
nature,
that
is,
the
conference
agreements
which
regulate
rates
involve
the
participation
of
the
parties
over
a
period
of
time
and
therefore
when
the
commission
may
originally
approve
it,
it
may
later
disapprove
it.
it’s
that
type
of
distinction
which
i
am
urging
on
the
court
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
bears
this
out.
i
think
it’s
quite
clear.
it’s
not
that
the
legislative
history
doesn’t
reflect
a
concern
by
the
committee,
the
alexander
committee,
which
is
as
your
honor
know
the
committee
that
investigated
the
shipping
industry.
it
isn't
that
that
committee
was
unaware
or
it
was
unconcerning
with
the
problems
of
the
acquisitions,
indeed
they
were.
in
the
domestic
trade
they
discussed
them
at
length
and
they
were
quite
concerned
about
the
railroads
gobbling
up
the
waterlines
in
the
inter-coastal
trade
and
on
the
great
lakes.
they
pointed
out
that
50%
of
all
the
tonnage
in
the
country
was
moving
through
water
carriers
that
were
owned
or
controlled
by
the
railroads.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
1910,
1911,
1912,
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
point
is,
not
that
they
were
--
merely
that
they
were
concerned,
but
they
simply
did
not
recommend
any
legislation
because
the
panama
canal
act
to
which
they
explicitly
refer
in
the
alexander
report
because
that
act
which
was
passed
in
1912
they
said,
went
very
far
towards
eliminating
the
evils
that
were
presented
by
railroad
domination
of
the
water
carriers
in
the
domestic
trade.
in
contrast
your
honors,
the
language
in
the
panama
canal
act
with
a
language
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
remembering
that
the
panama
canal
act
is
specifically
referred
to
in
the
report,
containing
the
recommendations
which
congress
adopted
in
the
shipping
act.
the
panama
canal
act
excerpts
which
i
have
set
forth
in
the
justice’s
brief
on
page
24,
in
the
panama
canal
act
congress
made
it
unlawful
for
any
railroad
and
i
quote,
“to
own,”
it
didn't
use
the
word
agreements,
“to
own
or
control
or
have
any
interest
whatsoever
by
stock
ownership
or
otherwise
either
directly
or
indirectly
etcetera,
etcetera,
of
any
common
carrier
by
water,”
it
didn’t
use
the
word
agreements.
also
contrast
to
the
later
amendment,
this
was
on
the
amendment
to
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
contrast
to
the
language
congress
used
in
the
1920
amendment
which
occurs
very
shortly
after
the
shipping
act.
that
amendment
dealt
both
with
agreements,
both
with
pooling
agreements
and
agreements
of
continuing
character
and
with
acquisitions
and
mergers.
the
pertinent
language
of
that
statute
your
honor
is
set
forth
on
page
--
the
top
of
page
26
and
in
footnote.
the
amendment
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
at
that
time
which
was
section
51
dealt
with
agreements
and
it
made
them
unlawful
unless
approved
by
the
commission,
interstate
commerce
commission,
“for
any
common
carrier
to
enter
into
any
contract,
agreement,
or
combination
with
any
other
common
carrier
for
the
pooling
of
freights
or
to
divide
between
them
the
aggregate
or
net
proceeds
of
the
earnings.”
now
there
we
are
talking
about
agreements
which
is
what
we
have
here
and
in
the
immediately
following
paragraph
of
that
statute
in
1920,
which
we
have
quoted
in
the
text
on
page
26
the
same
page,
congress
banned
interlocking
ownership.
we’re
talking
about
acquisitions
there,
“the
acquisition
by
one
carrier
(of
the
control
of
another)
under
a
lease
or
by
the
purchase
of
stock
in
any
other
manner
not
involving
the
consolidation
of
such
carriers
into
a
single
system.”
the
point
of
this
contrasting
language
is
to
show
that
congress
knew
how
to
make
--
knew
how
to
use
the
difference
--
the
different
jargon
to
describe
the
difference
between
an
agreement
which
is
involved
in
section
15
and
in
acquisition
or
merger
of
consolidation
which
is
a
very
different
breed
of
animal,
at
least
conceptualistically
in
the
minds
of
the
congress.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
your
honors
go
through
the
very
lengthy
alexander
report
because
i
am
sure
mr.
justice
stewart
probably
had
to
for
the
volkswagen
opinion,
your
honors
will
find
that
the
word
agreement
is
used
from
beginning
to
end
to
refer
only
to
cooperative
working
agreements,
agreements
of
a
continuing
kind,
rate
making
agreements,
pooling
agreements.
never,
never
to
acquisitions
or
mergers,
and
the
committee,
the
alexander
committee
did
use
the
word
acquisitions,
consolidations
and
or
mergers.
but
it
used
them
to
refer
precisely
to
that
and
i
would
like
to
read
one
paragraph
which
shows
the
contrasting
use
in
the
same
sentence
by
that
committee
of
an
agreement
and
an
acquisition.
i’m
reading
from
the
--
i
have
xerox
copies
from
the
alexander
report
and
i’m
reading
from
page
--
i
thought
i
was
--
409
of
that
report,
this
is
rather
a
brief.
the
committee
is
talking
about
the
domestic
trade
and
it
writes
--
describes
the
numerous
methods
of
controlling
competition
between
carriers.
the
first
method
is
control
through
the
acquisition
of
waterlines
or
the
ownership
of
accessories
to
the
lines.
no
worry
about
agreements
in
that.
control
through
the
acquisition
of
waterlines
or
the
ownership
of
accessories
to
the
lines.
two,
control
through
agreements
or
understandings.
now
the
committee
knew
how
to
use
the,
--
and
understood
very
well
the
difference
agreements
that
it
meant
in
acquisitions
and
the
fact
that
it
used
it
in
the
very
same
sentence,
it
seems
to
me
as
a
rather
eloquent
indication
of
the
difference,
it
was
drawing
in
its
mind
and
this
is
not
really
accidental.
if
your
honors
will
review
the
focus
of
the
committee
on
the
problem
that
was
bothering
it,
the
problem
of
conference
of
uses
at
the
time,
which
led
the
committee
to
recommend
the
enactment
of
particularly
section
15
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
during
the
last
half
of
the
19
century,
there
were
some
great
many
vessels
that
were
built
which
produced
a
surplus
capacity.
the
surplus
capacity
led
the
rate
wars.
this
was
undesirable
from
a
standpoint
of
shippers
because
of
the
instability
it
created.
they
never
can
tell
when
they
were
going
to
have
a
vessel
available,
importers
and
exporters.
it
was
undesirable
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carriers
because
of
the
potential
for
destruction,
these
destructive
rate
wars.
to
avoid
costly
struggles,
most
of
the
lines
banded
together
to
regulate
the
terms
on
which
they
competed.
most
of
the
lines
belonged
to
cartels,
this
is
all
reflected
in
the
celar
report
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs,
most
belonged
to
cartels
known
to
us
as
conferences,
associations
of
shipping
lines.
through
these
conferences
the
lines
were
able
to
agree
in
ways
to
moderate
the
rigors
of
competition,
how
to
punish
the
disloyal
shipper
who
shipped
on
a
non
conference
vessel,
how
regulate
the
rates
between
them.
now,
while
this
brought
about
some
stability
it
led,
understandably
led
to
abuses.
and
so
congress
in
1912
authorized
a
committee
to
investigate
these
practices.
the
committee
wrote
a
detailed
report
to
which
we
refer
to
many
times,
my
brother
gruis
did,
now
i
have.
it’s
the
alexander
report.
the
report
was
based
in
large
part,
so
far
as
the
foreign
trade
was
concerned
on
an
examination
of
eighty
agreements
that
were
then,
eighty
written
agreements,
there
were
many
secret
agreements,
a
practice
which
the
shipping
act
was
designed
to
correct,
to
bring
them
out
in
the
open
and
put
them
under
government
supervision.
what
is
striking
about
these
eighty
agreements
is
that
every
single
one
of
the
eighty
agreements
is
a
cooperative
working
agreement,
the
kind
--
the
pooling
type
regulating
rates.
not
a
single
one
of
the
eighty
agreements
examined
by
the
committee
in
the
foreign
trade
was
a
merger
agreement
or
an
acquisition
agreement
or
were
of
an
on-going
nature.
now,
the
committee
recognized
that
these
agreements
had
many
advantages.
the
problem
was
how
to
preserve
the
advantages
while
minimizing
their
potential
for
abuse.
the
advantages
were
clear,
the
regularity
of
sailings
if
they
were
assured
of
particular
rates,
the
vessels
would
sail
regularly,
the
importers
and
exporters
were
fairly
certain
about
the
rates
that
were
going
to
be
charged
so
they
knew
what
to
charge
themselves.
now,
if
unrestricted
competition,
if
the
committee
were
to
recommend
the
outlawing
these
agreements,
and
unrestricted
competition
were
the
mode
of
life
in
shipping
industry,
the
inevitable
result
would
be,
and
this
as
the
committee
describes,
rather
picturesquely,
and
at
great
length,
the
inevitable
result
would
rate
wars,
resulting
in
uncertainty
in
rates
and
schedules,
the
destruction
of
weaker
lines
and
protective
mergers
and
consolidations
with
monopoly
as
the
consequence,
that
was
the
analysis
made
by
the
committee.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
allowed
these
trade
restraining
agreements
of
fixing
of
rates,
the
pooling
and
it
were
placed
under
government
supervision,
the
advantages
would
be
preserved,
the
committee
pointed
out
and
also,
this
would
avoid
the
harm
to
structural
concentration
in
the
industry.
you
wouldn’t
have
as
a
result
of
destructive
rate
wars
the
lines
either
going
out
of
business
or
getting
together
and
consolidating.
so
one
reason
for
recommending
that
these
agreements
of
an
ongoing
nature,
be
authorized
under
government
supervision
was
to
avoid
forcing
these
irretrievable
and
permanent
consolidations
among
the
shipping
lines.
agreements
to
merge
were
simply
not
the
kind
of
agreement
that
the
committee
deemed
necessary
to
immunize
from
attack
under
the
antitrust
laws.
i
have
already
mentioned
that
the
committee
was
aware
of
acquisition,
the
problem
of
acquisitions
and
mergers
in
the
domestic
trade
and
made
a
recommendation
as
to
those.
i
have
mentioned
that
the
committee
used
the
word
agreements
in
a
very
distinctive
sense
certainly
not
to
include
mergers
and
consolidations.
i
think
the
question
before,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
desirable
as
my
brother
gruis
suggests
as
a
matter
of
policy,
i
think
is
debatable.
the
question
before
your
honor
is
whether
the
congress
intended
in
section
15
to
give
the
agency
the
authority
to
pass
on
mergers
and
acquisitions
and
that
is
the
only
question
before
your
honors
and
i
submit
that
the
evidence
is
overwhelmingly
against
that
grant
of
authority.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
am
not
suggesting
the
particular
transaction
involved
in
this
case
is
a
violation
(voice
overlap)
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
no.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
judge
wilkie
expressed
no
opinion.
we
express
no
opinion
as
to
that.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes
sir.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
it
does
recognize
that
the
only
--
with
the
problem
it
had
before
it
was
what
to
do
about
the
conferences
and
the
kind
of
agreements
that
it
had
before
them.
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
an
examination
of
the
history
that
even
though
they
were
aware
of
acquisitions
they
didn’t
mean
to
include
them
in
section
15.
they
did
point
out
in
their
report,
they
did
refer
to
the
panama
canal
act
which
deals
specifically
with
that
problem.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it
was,
well,
i
think
it
was
[attempt
to
laughter]
later
found
out
in
this
court.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it
probably
was
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
now,
stock
acquisitions
i
think
were
the
predominant
mode
of
mergers
and
acquisitions,
but
that's
right
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
though
my
brother
gruis,
if
may
have
one
further
word,
has
indicated
that
it
probably
wouldn’t
make
much
sense
to
say
that
an
acquisition
if
it
is
covered
--
he
referred
to
a
transaction
where
an
acquisition
was
accompanied
by
an
ancillary
ongoing
covenant
not
to
compete.
the
latter
by
itself
would
be
the
kind
of
agreement
we
would
concede
that
is
within
section
15.
he
suggests
that
it
wouldn’t
make
sense
to
make
the
distinction
to
say
it
is
and
therefore
the
commission
can
pass
on
the
whole
--
in
fact,
i
agree
with
him
that
it
wouldn’t
make
sense
to
say
if
the
acquisition
is
not
subject
to
the
commission
jurisdiction,
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
should
say
that
the
acquisition,
we
deal
with
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
that
the
acquisition
accompanied
by
the
ancillary
covenant
not
to
compete
or
some
ancillary
restrain
would,
just
because
the
parties
cast
their
agreement
in
a
particular
form
should
bring
the
transaction
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction
for
that
reason.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
where
a
statutory
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
statute
on
partitions
for
review
of
the

requires
that
the

mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
don’t
think
so
in
other
cases.
mr.
irwin

seibel
yes
sir.
we
were
served
with
the
petition
for
review
and
the
statute
which
is
title
28,

i
believe.
mr.
irwin

seibel
no,
no.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
interstate
commerce
act
--
the
united
states
wasa
statutory
defendant
and
we
normally
do
not
join
together
like
with

--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
oh
no,
under
the
statute
of
the
maritime
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
there
maybe,
that’s
right
i
think
perhaps
under
the
federal
aeronautics
act,
that’s
true.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
you
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
we
are,
yes.
mr.
irwin

seibel
i
do
your

[attempt

nominally

least
(voice

i
am
not
sure
i
know
how
to
--
mr.

for
this?
mr.

we

they
have

mr.

yes

mr.

i
think
he
could.

general
--
mr.
irwin

as
a
matter
of
form
in
this

i
think
under

they
--
perhaps
i
am
misspeaking
but
i
do
think
under
the
statute
they
have
the
right.
mr.
irwin

seibel
they
could
have
been
here
and
they
are
here

mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
they
could
have
been
here.
i
think
the
seatrain
didn't
happen
to
take
position
on
the
jurisdiction
in
the
court
below.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
sorry,
but
mr.
justice
powell,
were
you
saying
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
great
uncertainty,
i
think,
that
would
result
as
to
the
scope
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
i
think
what
you
would
have
the
lawyers
simply
restructuring
an
acquisition
with
an
agreement
not
to
compete
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
judge
wilkie
meant
to
do
that
or
perhaps
he
was
--
i
think
it
would
be
desirable,
your
honors
don't
often
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case
so
that
we
don’t
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
to
a
couple
of
points
that
my
brother
gruis
raised
during
the
course
of
his
argument
and
one
was
that
the
question
as
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
was
first
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
it’s
relevant,
but
lest
it
may
seem
relevant
to
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
that
it
was
raised
--
i
could
find
at
least
two
places
in
the
record
where
it
as
raised
before
the
commission.
one
in
the
appendix
at
page
33
in
the
letter
from
the
applicant
to
the
commission,
the
applicant
for
approval
of
the
transaction.
in
the
second
paragraph
of
page
33,
the
applicant
says
that
they
have
been
advised
by
their
council,
i’m
skipping,
that
their
transaction
does
not
require
approval
by
the
commission.
nevertheless,
they
are
submitting
their
papers
for
approval
in
the
event
the
commission
should
differ
with
them.
so
that
i
think
it
was
there
clearly
raised
by
the
applicants,
the
question,
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
their
transaction.
again
your
honor,
i
find
that
on
page
52
of
the
appendix
in
footnote
one
where
the
applicants
again
say
we
preserve
our
position
that
the
pfel
oceanic
agreement
is
not
subject
to
section
15
of
the
shipping
act.
i
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference,
but
maybe
to
your
honors.
the
other
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
immediately
is
they
rather
lengthy
policy
argument
that
my
brother
gruis
made.
he
says
that
it
is
desirable
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
the
commission
be
given
the
jurisdiction
over
acquisitions
and
merger
agreements
because
he
says
that
the
commission
is
more
flexible
and
it
does
take
into
account
antitrust
considerations
in
its
decisions.
that
is
certainly
an
arguable
question
of
policy.
two
courts
differed
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
desirable.
judge
meryl
in
the
ninth
circuit
speaking
for
the
majority
of
his
panel,
thought
it
would
be
desirable,
on
the
other
hand
judge
wilkie
speaking
for
the
court
below
in
this
case
raised
question
as
to
whether
or
not
be
it
would
desirable,
but
that
your
honor
is
a
question
for
congress.
the
question
before
this
court
is,
whether
section
15
was
intended
to
grant
the
federal
maritime
commission
jurisdiction
over
mergers
and
acquisitions
and
that
is
the
question
your
honors
have
to
decide.
i
think
that
my
brother
gruis
was
assuming
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
and
was
pointing
out
how
good
it
is
and
how
desirable
it
is
that
they
should
have
it.
now,
the
shipping
act
does
not
provide
a
pervasive
regulatory
scheme
for
the
shipping
industry.
it
was
never
intended
to
do
that
and
it
doesn’t
do
it
today,
it
doesn’t
regulate
entry,
it
doesn’t
have
the
general
power
to
set
rates,
maximum-minimum
rates.
what
the
shipping
act
was
intended
to
do
was
to
place
under
government
supervision
the
practices
of
shipping
lines
which
banded
together
in
setting
up
trade
restraining
agreements
through
the
instrumentality
of
conferences.
these
are
associations
of
shipping
lines
and
essentially
that
was
what
was
intended
where
the
shipping
lines
worked
out
agreements
whereby
they
regulated
rates
among
themselves.
they
regulated
sailings,
they
allotted
ports,
and
it
was
that
type
of
trade
restraining
agreement
that
section
15
was
designed
to
cover.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
language
of
section
15
very
briefly.
while
i
think
it’s
inconclusive,
i
think
our
reading
of
section
15
is
more
reasonable
than
the
one
that
the
commission
suggests.
your
honors,
i
think
you’ll
find
the
pertinent
parts
of
that
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition.
it
reproduces
--
it’s
a
gray
covered
document
and
on
page
19,
it
reproduces
judge
wilkie’s
opinion
on
this
case
where
he
sets
forth
the
shipping
act
or
portions
of
it
as
it
was
originally
enacted.
i
don’t
think
any
pertinent
changes
were
made
in
1961
for
our
purposes.
one
page
19,
judge
wilkie
sets
forth
in
a
series
the
seven
categories
of
agreements
which
section
15
covers.
your
honors,
if
we
remove
the
middle
category
that
was
clause;
which
the
opinion
labels
clause
3,
and
on
which
my
brother
gruis
relies
principally,
that
is
the
category
of
agreements
controlling
preventing
and
so
forth
competition.
if
we
remove
that
for
a
moment
and
examine
all
the
other
categories,
the
first
is
an
agreement
fixing
rates,
(inaudible)
an
ongoing
type
of
agreement.
the
second
is
agreements
giving
special
rates
and
accommodations,
another
of
the
same
type.
now,
i
will
skip
the
third,
which
is
the
one
my
brother
gruis
relies
on.
the
fourth
are
agreements
pooling
or
apportioning
earnings,
again
an
agreement
of
an
ongoing
type
that’s
susceptible
to
continuing
supervision
by
the
agency.
the
fifth
are
agreements
allotting
ports
and
regulating
sailings,
again,
an
agreement
of
the
same
type.
the
sixth
are
agreements
regulating
the
volume
of
traffic,
again
these
are
ongoing,
agreements
of
an
ongoing
nature
and
then
finally,
the
last
is
a
catch
all
provision,
agreements
in
any
manner
providing
for
an
exclusive
preferential
or
cooperative
working
agreement.
now,
clearly,
those
five
agreements
are
all
of
the
same
type
as
the
one
in
the
final
clause.
they
are
all
the
--
they
are
specific
and
unambiguous
agreements
of
an
ongoing
nature
and
the
last
is
obviously
a
generalized
type
describing
the
same
type
of
agreements
that
were
previously
described.
it
seems
to
be
quite
reasonable
to
me.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
mean,
obviously
in
sense
of
generalized
rather
than
specific
your
honor.
that’s
what
i
meant
rather
than
--
what
i’m
suggesting
your
honor
is
not
that
the
language
is
conclusive.
i
am
suggesting
that
it's
fair
to
read
the
language
as
we
urge
rather
than
the
commission
urges
and
given
the
fact
that
the
language
on
which
it
relies
is
in
the
middle
of
the
specific
and
unambiguous
clauses
that
was
intended
to
be
of
the
same
type
as
the
other
clauses
immediately
preceding
it
and
following
it
and
that
the
last
clause,
the
generalized
clause
was
summarizing
the
kinds
of
agreements
that
preceded
it.
that
is
agreements,
trade
restraining
agreements,
agreements
of
an
ongoing
nature
which
are
susceptible
of
continuing
supervision
by
the
agency.
the
support
for
this
construction
is
provided
in
the
paragraphs
immediately
following.
i
will
take
one.
i
think
perhaps
we
can’t
dwell
on
this
too
long,
because
i
think
the
conclusive
answers
are
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
contemporaneous
and
subsequent
legislation
where
the
congress
was
very
explicit
when
it
wanted
to
give
an
agency
authority
over
acquisitions
and
mergers.
where
in
the
same
statute
the
congress
gave
the
agency
jurisdiction
over
agreements
in
one
clause
and
in
a
separate
clause,
specifically
addressed
itself
to
acquisitions
and
consolidation.
conceptually
congress
thought
of
them
as
being
of
a
different
breed
and
i
think
this
was
true
in
the
case
of
the
shipping
act.
in
the
paragraph
immediately
following
the
clauses,
i
just
quoted,
this
appears
on
page
20
of
the
appendix,
i’ll
take
one.
there
at
three
such
paragraphs
i
think,
one
would
be
sufficient
illustrate
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make.
it
provides
that
the
commission
may
disapprove
an
agreement,
i’m
skipping,
whether
or
not
previously
approved
by
it.
now,
i
think
that
an
acquisition
agreement
is
not
readily
susceptible
of
that
type
of
treatment,
that
is
once
it’s
consummated,
while
it’s
gone
and
has
disappeared
generally.
whereas
an
agreement
of
a
continuing
nature,
that
is,
the
conference
agreements
which
regulate
rates
involve
the
participation
of
the
parties
over
a
period
of
time
and
therefore
when
the
commission
may
originally
approve
it,
it
may
later
disapprove
it.
it’s
that
type
of
distinction
which
i
am
urging
on
the
court
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
bears
this
out.
i
think
it’s
quite
clear.
it’s
not
that
the
legislative
history
doesn’t
reflect
a
concern
by
the
committee,
the
alexander
committee,
which
is
as
your
honor
know
the
committee
that
investigated
the
shipping
industry.
it
isn't
that
that
committee
was
unaware
or
it
was
unconcerning
with
the
problems
of
the
acquisitions,
indeed
they
were.
in
the
domestic
trade
they
discussed
them
at
length
and
they
were
quite
concerned
about
the
railroads
gobbling
up
the
waterlines
in
the
inter-coastal
trade
and
on
the
great
lakes.
they
pointed
out
that
50%
of
all
the
tonnage
in
the
country
was
moving
through
water
carriers
that
were
owned
or
controlled
by
the
railroads.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
1910,
1911,
1912,
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
point
is,
not
that
they
were
--
merely
that
they
were
concerned,
but
they
simply
did
not
recommend
any
legislation
because
the
panama
canal
act
to
which
they
explicitly
refer
in
the
alexander
report
because
that
act
which
was
passed
in
1912
they
said,
went
very
far
towards
eliminating
the
evils
that
were
presented
by
railroad
domination
of
the
water
carriers
in
the
domestic
trade.
in
contrast
your
honors,
the
language
in
the
panama
canal
act
with
a
language
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
remembering
that
the
panama
canal
act
is
specifically
referred
to
in
the
report,
containing
the
recommendations
which
congress
adopted
in
the
shipping
act.
the
panama
canal
act
excerpts
which
i
have
set
forth
in
the
justice’s
brief
on
page
24,
in
the
panama
canal
act
congress
made
it
unlawful
for
any
railroad
and
i
quote,
“to
own,”
it
didn't
use
the
word
agreements,
“to
own
or
control
or
have
any
interest
whatsoever
by
stock
ownership
or
otherwise
either
directly
or
indirectly
etcetera,
etcetera,
of
any
common
carrier
by
water,”
it
didn’t
use
the
word
agreements.
also
contrast
to
the
later
amendment,
this
was
on
the
amendment
to
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
contrast
to
the
language
congress
used
in
the
1920
amendment
which
occurs
very
shortly
after
the
shipping
act.
that
amendment
dealt
both
with
agreements,
both
with
pooling
agreements
and
agreements
of
continuing
character
and
with
acquisitions
and
mergers.
the
pertinent
language
of
that
statute
your
honor
is
set
forth
on
page
--
the
top
of
page
26
and
in
footnote.
the
amendment
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
at
that
time
which
was
section
51
dealt
with
agreements
and
it
made
them
unlawful
unless
approved
by
the
commission,
interstate
commerce
commission,
“for
any
common
carrier
to
enter
into
any
contract,
agreement,
or
combination
with
any
other
common
carrier
for
the
pooling
of
freights
or
to
divide
between
them
the
aggregate
or
net
proceeds
of
the
earnings.”
now
there
we
are
talking
about
agreements
which
is
what
we
have
here
and
in
the
immediately
following
paragraph
of
that
statute
in
1920,
which
we
have
quoted
in
the
text
on
page
26
the
same
page,
congress
banned
interlocking
ownership.
we’re
talking
about
acquisitions
there,
“the
acquisition
by
one
carrier
(of
the
control
of
another)
under
a
lease
or
by
the
purchase
of
stock
in
any
other
manner
not
involving
the
consolidation
of
such
carriers
into
a
single
system.”
the
point
of
this
contrasting
language
is
to
show
that
congress
knew
how
to
make
--
knew
how
to
use
the
difference
--
the
different
jargon
to
describe
the
difference
between
an
agreement
which
is
involved
in
section
15
and
in
acquisition
or
merger
of
consolidation
which
is
a
very
different
breed
of
animal,
at
least
conceptualistically
in
the
minds
of
the
congress.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
your
honors
go
through
the
very
lengthy
alexander
report
because
i
am
sure
mr.
justice
stewart
probably
had
to
for
the
volkswagen
opinion,
your
honors
will
find
that
the
word
agreement
is
used
from
beginning
to
end
to
refer
only
to
cooperative
working
agreements,
agreements
of
a
continuing
kind,
rate
making
agreements,
pooling
agreements.
never,
never
to
acquisitions
or
mergers,
and
the
committee,
the
alexander
committee
did
use
the
word
acquisitions,
consolidations
and
or
mergers.
but
it
used
them
to
refer
precisely
to
that
and
i
would
like
to
read
one
paragraph
which
shows
the
contrasting
use
in
the
same
sentence
by
that
committee
of
an
agreement
and
an
acquisition.
i’m
reading
from
the
--
i
have
xerox
copies
from
the
alexander
report
and
i’m
reading
from
page
--
i
thought
i
was
--
409
of
that
report,
this
is
rather
a
brief.
the
committee
is
talking
about
the
domestic
trade
and
it
writes
--
describes
the
numerous
methods
of
controlling
competition
between
carriers.
the
first
method
is
control
through
the
acquisition
of
waterlines
or
the
ownership
of
accessories
to
the
lines.
no
worry
about
agreements
in
that.
control
through
the
acquisition
of
waterlines
or
the
ownership
of
accessories
to
the
lines.
two,
control
through
agreements
or
understandings.
now
the
committee
knew
how
to
use
the,
--
and
understood
very
well
the
difference
agreements
that
it
meant
in
acquisitions
and
the
fact
that
it
used
it
in
the
very
same
sentence,
it
seems
to
me
as
a
rather
eloquent
indication
of
the
difference,
it
was
drawing
in
its
mind
and
this
is
not
really
accidental.
if
your
honors
will
review
the
focus
of
the
committee
on
the
problem
that
was
bothering
it,
the
problem
of
conference
of
uses
at
the
time,
which
led
the
committee
to
recommend
the
enactment
of
particularly
section
15
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
during
the
last
half
of
the
19
century,
there
were
some
great
many
vessels
that
were
built
which
produced
a
surplus
capacity.
the
surplus
capacity
led
the
rate
wars.
this
was
undesirable
from
a
standpoint
of
shippers
because
of
the
instability
it
created.
they
never
can
tell
when
they
were
going
to
have
a
vessel
available,
importers
and
exporters.
it
was
undesirable
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carriers
because
of
the
potential
for
destruction,
these
destructive
rate
wars.
to
avoid
costly
struggles,
most
of
the
lines
banded
together
to
regulate
the
terms
on
which
they
competed.
most
of
the
lines
belonged
to
cartels,
this
is
all
reflected
in
the
celar
report
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs,
most
belonged
to
cartels
known
to
us
as
conferences,
associations
of
shipping
lines.
through
these
conferences
the
lines
were
able
to
agree
in
ways
to
moderate
the
rigors
of
competition,
how
to
punish
the
disloyal
shipper
who
shipped
on
a
non
conference
vessel,
how
regulate
the
rates
between
them.
now,
while
this
brought
about
some
stability
it
led,
understandably
led
to
abuses.
and
so
congress
in
1912
authorized
a
committee
to
investigate
these
practices.
the
committee
wrote
a
detailed
report
to
which
we
refer
to
many
times,
my
brother
gruis
did,
now
i
have.
it’s
the
alexander
report.
the
report
was
based
in
large
part,
so
far
as
the
foreign
trade
was
concerned
on
an
examination
of
eighty
agreements
that
were
then,
eighty
written
agreements,
there
were
many
secret
agreements,
a
practice
which
the
shipping
act
was
designed
to
correct,
to
bring
them
out
in
the
open
and
put
them
under
government
supervision.
what
is
striking
about
these
eighty
agreements
is
that
every
single
one
of
the
eighty
agreements
is
a
cooperative
working
agreement,
the
kind
--
the
pooling
type
regulating
rates.
not
a
single
one
of
the
eighty
agreements
examined
by
the
committee
in
the
foreign
trade
was
a
merger
agreement
or
an
acquisition
agreement
or
were
of
an
on-going
nature.
now,
the
committee
recognized
that
these
agreements
had
many
advantages.
the
problem
was
how
to
preserve
the
advantages
while
minimizing
their
potential
for
abuse.
the
advantages
were
clear,
the
regularity
of
sailings
if
they
were
assured
of
particular
rates,
the
vessels
would
sail
regularly,
the
importers
and
exporters
were
fairly
certain
about
the
rates
that
were
going
to
be
charged
so
they
knew
what
to
charge
themselves.
now,
if
unrestricted
competition,
if
the
committee
were
to
recommend
the
outlawing
these
agreements,
and
unrestricted
competition
were
the
mode
of
life
in
shipping
industry,
the
inevitable
result
would
be,
and
this
as
the
committee
describes,
rather
picturesquely,
and
at
great
length,
the
inevitable
result
would
rate
wars,
resulting
in
uncertainty
in
rates
and
schedules,
the
destruction
of
weaker
lines
and
protective
mergers
and
consolidations
with
monopoly
as
the
consequence,
that
was
the
analysis
made
by
the
committee.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
allowed
these
trade
restraining
agreements
of
fixing
of
rates,
the
pooling
and
it
were
placed
under
government
supervision,
the
advantages
would
be
preserved,
the
committee
pointed
out
and
also,
this
would
avoid
the
harm
to
structural
concentration
in
the
industry.
you
wouldn’t
have
as
a
result
of
destructive
rate
wars
the
lines
either
going
out
of
business
or
getting
together
and
consolidating.
so
one
reason
for
recommending
that
these
agreements
of
an
ongoing
nature,
be
authorized
under
government
supervision
was
to
avoid
forcing
these
irretrievable
and
permanent
consolidations
among
the
shipping
lines.
agreements
to
merge
were
simply
not
the
kind
of
agreement
that
the
committee
deemed
necessary
to
immunize
from
attack
under
the
antitrust
laws.
i
have
already
mentioned
that
the
committee
was
aware
of
acquisition,
the
problem
of
acquisitions
and
mergers
in
the
domestic
trade
and
made
a
recommendation
as
to
those.
i
have
mentioned
that
the
committee
used
the
word
agreements
in
a
very
distinctive
sense
certainly
not
to
include
mergers
and
consolidations.
i
think
the
question
before,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
desirable
as
my
brother
gruis
suggests
as
a
matter
of
policy,
i
think
is
debatable.
the
question
before
your
honor
is
whether
the
congress
intended
in
section
15
to
give
the
agency
the
authority
to
pass
on
mergers
and
acquisitions
and
that
is
the
only
question
before
your
honors
and
i
submit
that
the
evidence
is
overwhelmingly
against
that
grant
of
authority.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
am
not
suggesting
the
particular
transaction
involved
in
this
case
is
a
violation
(voice
overlap)
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
no.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
judge
wilkie
expressed
no
opinion.
we
express
no
opinion
as
to
that.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes
sir.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
it
does
recognize
that
the
only
--
with
the
problem
it
had
before
it
was
what
to
do
about
the
conferences
and
the
kind
of
agreements
that
it
had
before
them.
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
an
examination
of
the
history
that
even
though
they
were
aware
of
acquisitions
they
didn’t
mean
to
include
them
in
section
15.
they
did
point
out
in
their
report,
they
did
refer
to
the
panama
canal
act
which
deals
specifically
with
that
problem.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it
was,
well,
i
think
it
was
[attempt
to
laughter]
later
found
out
in
this
court.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it
probably
was
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
now,
stock
acquisitions
i
think
were
the
predominant
mode
of
mergers
and
acquisitions,
but
that's
right
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
though
my
brother
gruis,
if
may
have
one
further
word,
has
indicated
that
it
probably
wouldn’t
make
much
sense
to
say
that
an
acquisition
if
it
is
covered
--
he
referred
to
a
transaction
where
an
acquisition
was
accompanied
by
an
ancillary
ongoing
covenant
not
to
compete.
the
latter
by
itself
would
be
the
kind
of
agreement
we
would
concede
that
is
within
section
15.
he
suggests
that
it
wouldn’t
make
sense
to
make
the
distinction
to
say
it
is
and
therefore
the
commission
can
pass
on
the
whole
--
in
fact,
i
agree
with
him
that
it
wouldn’t
make
sense
to
say
if
the
acquisition
is
not
subject
to
the
commission
jurisdiction,
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
should
say
that
the
acquisition,
we
deal
with
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
that
the
acquisition
accompanied
by
the
ancillary
covenant
not
to
compete
or
some
ancillary
restrain
would,
just
because
the
parties
cast
their
agreement
in
a
particular
form
should
bring
the
transaction
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction
for
that
reason.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
where
a
statutory
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
statute
on
partitions
for
review
of
the
agency’s
decision
requires
that
the
united
states
be
a
party.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel

commerce
commission.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
don’t
think
so
in
other
cases.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes
sir.
we
were
served
with
the
petition
for
review
and
the
statute
which
is
title
28,
u.s.c.
2342,
i
believe.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
no.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
the
interstate
commerce
act
--
the
united
states
wasa
statutory
defendant
and
we
normally
do
not
join
together
like
with
sisters
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
oh
no,
under
the
statute
of
the
maritime
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
there
maybe,
that’s
right
i
think
perhaps
under
the
federal
aeronautics
act,
that’s
true.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
you
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
we
are,
yes.
mr.

seibel
i
do
your

i
am
not
sure
i
know
how
to
--
mr.
irwin

seibel
for
this?
mr.
irwin

seibel
we
did.

we
did

yes

mr.

i
think
he
could.

--
mr.
irwin

seibel
as
a
matter
of
form
in
this
case
i
think
under
the
statute
they
--
perhaps
i
am
misspeaking
but
i
do
think
under
the
statute
they
have
the
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
they
could
have
been
here
and
they
are
here
through
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
they
could
have
been
here.
i
think
the
seatrain
didn't
happen
to
take
position
on
the
jurisdiction
in
the
court
below.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
sorry,
but
mr.
justice
powell,
were
you
saying
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
great
uncertainty,
i
think,
that
would
result
as
to
the
scope
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
i
think
what
you
would
have
the
lawyers
simply
restructuring
an
acquisition
with
an
agreement
not
to
compete
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
judge
wilkie
meant
to
do
that
or
perhaps
he
was
--
i
think
it
would
be
desirable,
your
honors
don't
often
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case
so
that
we
don’t
