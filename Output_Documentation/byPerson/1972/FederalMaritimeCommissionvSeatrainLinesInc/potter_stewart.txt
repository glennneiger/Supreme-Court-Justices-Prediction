justice

stewart
this
was
back
in
19
--?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
suppose
that
if
you’re
correct
on
this
issue,
which
is
the
only
issue
before
us
whether
or
not
section
15
is
(inaudible)
whether
--
this
is
something
that
is
filable
under
15
and
if
the
committee
--
if
the
commission
approves
is
immune
from
the
antitrust
act,
that’s
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
suppose
that
if
you’re
right
there
that
the
full
force
of
the
antitrust
funds
would
--
it
would
follow,
they
would
apply
to
this
acquisition?
justice
potter
stewart
it
can't
be
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
of
course
is
not
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
certainly
--
the
legislative
history
does
show
the
realization
by
congress
of
the
fact
that
this
industry
is
sui
generis,
if
you
will
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
therefore
is,
i
believe,
not
to
be
the
target
of
the
full
force
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
such.
you
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
at
that
time
the
sale
of
assets
was
not
covered
by
the
anti
trust
law?
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
but
nobody
knew
it
was
at
that
time?
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
well
(inaudible)
exactly
what
the
statue
contemplates.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
well.
justice
potter
stewart

that's
what
we
are
hearing?
