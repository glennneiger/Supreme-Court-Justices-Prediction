justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
will
ask
this
question.
you
are
here
as
i
understand
it,
asking
this
court
to
have
affirmed
the
judgment
below?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
addition,
you
say
at
the
end
of
your
brief
that
you
think
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
erred
in
the
distinction
it
may
between
what
was
called
the
simple
merger
or
sale
of
assets
and
one
that
had
some
ongoing
characteristic
such
as
a
covenant
not
to
compete.
so
is
it
your
position
that
if
we
should
have
affirm,
that
you
think
we
should
address
that
issue
also?
