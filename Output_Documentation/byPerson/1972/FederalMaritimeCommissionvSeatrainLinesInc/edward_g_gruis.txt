mr.
edward
g.
gruis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
practical
question
here
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
that
the
federal
maritime
commission
is
going
to
be
able
to
continue
under
its
present
statutory
authority
to
effectively
regulate
and
supervise
america’s
maritime
industry.
the
matter
here
this
morning
comes
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
which
vacated
the
federal
maritime
commission
order
approving
the
merger
of
assets
of
one
shipping
company
to
that
of
another
shipping
company.
in
overruling
the
commission's
order,
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
under
section
15
of
the
shipping
act,
authorizing
it
to
approve
such
sales
thereby
giving
such
transactions'
immunity
under
the
antitrust
laws.
so
that
we’re
real
certain
as
to
what
the
facts
of
the
situation
is.
in
this
particular
case
along
about
1970
pacific
far
east
lines
entered
into
in
a
contract
with
one
of
matson's
subsidiaries,
oceanic
steamship
company,
to
sale
of
four
ships
then
in
operation,
two
ships
that
were
under
construction
and
associated
facilities
like
personnel
and
so
on
that
along
with
those
ships.
there
was
a
protest
on
this
matter
at
commission
level.
the
commission
finding
this
protest
without
substance
and
upon
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
parties,
approved
the
transaction,
it
was
immediately
appealed
by
the
protestants
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
the
question
was
raised
for
the
first
time
as
to
the
commission's
section
15
jurisdiction
over
this
type
of
transaction.
since
the
language
of
section
15
is
so
critical
to
our
understanding
this
morning,
i
would
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
page
two
of
our
brief
or
to
the
language
of
section
15
itself,
in
the
first
or
second
paragraph
i
believe,
wherein,
the
third
clause
or
category
says
“that
agreements
between
carriers
shall
be
committed
to
commission
which
are
controlling,
regulating,
preventing,
or
destroying
competition.”
now,
in
addition
to
that
this
paragraph
goes
on
to
indicate
that
agreements
also
include
understandings,
conferences
and
other
arrangements.
section
15
also
makes
specific
provision
for
an
antitrust
exemption,
for
agreements
that
have
come
before
the
commission
and
are
lawfully
approved.
now,
the
commission
has
operated
with
this
law
for
over
two
decades
approving
some
transactions
formally,
others
informally,
and
even
rejecting
some
transactions
that
had
been
presented
to
it.
the
question
presented
here
today
was
really
not
raised
in
the
judicial
setting
until
1968,
some
time
after
the
commission
had
been
operating
with
this
law
and
approving
merger
and
acquisition,
consolidation
transactions
when
before
the
commission
and
subsequently
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
last
clause
of
the
first
paragraph
in
section
15
which
is
a
sort
of
a
catch-all
clause
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph
and
reads
“or
in
any
manner
providing
for
an
exclusive
preferential
or
cooperative
working
arrangement
whether
or
not
that
clause
limits
the
foregoing
six
categories
under
the
shipping
act,
they
are
to
be
presented
to
the
commission.”
now,
this
clause
was
originally
rejected
in
the
ninth
circuit
court,
and
met
by
matson
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
case,
on
the
basis
of
justice
stewart’s
decision
in
volkswagen
wherein,
he
indicted
that
section
15
and
the
language
used
in
that
part
of
the
statute
is
very
broad
and
is
very
expansive
and
probably
would
not
be
circumscribed
by
these
other
–
this
one
category
at
the
end
of
section
15.
now,
i
think
it's
important
here
for
us
to
understand
the
type
of
industry
that
we’re
operating
in
and
i
think
it
should
be
immediately
apparent
that
we’re
really
having
problems
reconciling
two
conflicting
statutes
or
perhaps
three
conflicting
statutes,
namely
the
shipping
act,
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act.
but
we
submit
first
of
all
that
the
initial
purpose
and
concept
behind
enactment
of
the
shipping
act
back
in
1916
was
to
create
a
specialized
and
expert
agency
to
regulate
maritime
affairs.
now,
if
this
was
the
goal
or
the
objective
behind
the
original
shipping
act
then
maritime
commission
would
not
be
able
to
accomplish
this
if
it
has
one
arm
tied
behind
its
back
so
to
speak,
being
unable
to
act
or
to
oversee
transactions
that
may
involve
mergers
or
consolidations
or
acquisitions
between
shipping
companies.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
not
that
i
know
off,
no
sir.
there
is
no
recorded,
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
it
well
might
have
been
that
the
papers
had
been
submitted
to
it,
but
we
have
no
reference
of
any
recorded
transaction,
that
it
had
acted
unofficially,
no
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
in
this
connection
if
may
mr.
justice
blackmun,
suggest
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
structure
of
the
maritime
agency
back
in
1960
when
the
regulatory
arm
was
split
off
from
the
promotion
arm
of
the
maritime
industry
insofar
as
government
regulation
was
concerned.
it
was
when
this
regulatory
arm,
namely
the
federal
maritime
commission
was
setup
for
the
purpose
of
effectively
regulating
the
shipping
act
statutes
it
became
much
more
concerned
and
interested
in
the
various
transactions
that
were
going
on
in
the
maritime
industry
insofar
as
acquisitions
and
mergers
were
concerned.
i
suggest
gentlemen
that
with
these
two
conflicting
statutory
goals,
namely
the
goal
of
the
antitrust
law
to
preserve
a
competitive
environment
and
the
goal
of
the
shipping
act
which
uses
antitrust
standards
as
only
one
of
the
criterion.
the
commission
has
looked
upon
these
transactions
in
the
past,
endeavored
to
balance
both
of
these
conflicting
public
policy
aims.
i
suggest
that
in
treating
this
question
for
example
if
justice
for
example
were
to
prevail,
the
department
of
justice
on
this,
we
would
have
two
different
types
of
transactions
very
closely
related,
but
entirely
judged
by
different
standards.
it's
been
suggested
in
the
brief
for
example
that
a
single
ship
sale
to
an
area
where
service
may
be
needed
could
by
justice
department's
move
or
the
federal
trade
commission
for
that
matter
of
fact
enjoin
that
if
it
had
the
--
if
it
met
the
tests
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
transaction
was
viewed
only
as
limiting
competition
or
tending
towards
monopoly.
now,
the
maritime
commission
i
believe
has
a
bigger
goal
or
a
bigger
objective
than
this
under
the
shipping
act.
the
standards
given
to
that
were
several
sets
of
standards
aside
from
purely
competitor
standards.
and
those
included
--
and
i
think
they
are
also
listed
in
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
transaction
would
be
unjustly
discriminatory
or
unfair
between
carriers
and
suppliers
whether
or
not
it
would
operate
to
the
determent
of
the
commerce
of
united
states,
whether
it
would
be
in
violation
of
any
other
shipping
act
provision,
or
whether
it
would
be
contrary
to
public
interest.
now,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
contrary
to
public
interest
has
been
read
by
this
court
as
including
antitrust
standards.
that
appeared
i
believe
in
the
decision
of
svenska
where
the
court
read
right
into
it,
that
the
commission
could
not
ignore
antitrust
considerations
in
passing
or
making
rulings
on
any
of
the
transactions
coming
in
before
it
for
approval
under
section
15
or
upon
which
the
commission
may
act
on
its
own
motion
with
respect
to
some
transactions.
now,
there
has
been
a
question
here
presented
as
to
whether
or
not
since
the
transaction
is
discrete,
consummated,
completed
so
to
speak,
it
is
not
stayed
according
to
lower
court
perhaps
by
having
a
conditional
covenant
or
some
type
of
replicable
or
reversionary
interest
of
follow
the
sail
of
the
ship
or
the
closing
of
an
acquisition
transaction.
the
commission
has
great
doubts
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
very
practical
approach
because
it
soon
becomes
a
technique
in
the
way
you
would
draft
acquisition
agreements.
the
court
below
has
listed
a
series
of
cases,
all
of
which
it
points
to
is
containing
some
sort
of
covenant
not
to
compete.
but
those
are
not
unusual
in
merger
acquisition
transactions
if
you’re
buying
somebody
out
and
still
we
don't
feel
that’s
crucial
or
critical
enough
to
stay
this
type
of
transaction
from
going
under
antitrust
judgment.
in
other
words,
we
believe
it
has
stayed
fully
under
the
shipping
act
in
all
respects.
now,
i
believe
one
of
the
problems
here
that
is
posed
most
importantly
with
respect
to
policy
consideration
is
basically
this.
that
when
a
transaction
comes
before
the
commission
whether
it's
in
the
form
of
an
acquisition
and
merger,
the
question
always
is
raised
is,
is
this
going
to
be
tested
strictly
by
competitive
standards
or
is
it
going
to
be
tested
by
that
criteria
that
i
have
explained
to
you
under
the
shipping
act,
section
15.
now,
if
the
transaction
is
to
be
tested
either
by
the
federal
trade
commission
or
by
the
department
of
justice
in
the
court
some
place
strictly
on
competitive
standards,
frequently
the
transactions
will
fall,
even
though
it
may
well
satisfy
all
the
other
standards
of
the
shipping
act
and
even
though
it
may
in
the
overall
view
be
in
the
best
public
interest.
but,
neither
the
federal
trade
commission
operating
under
the
authority
of
clayton
act
section
7
nor
the
department
of
justice
either
under
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act
could
stray
too
far
from
that
set
competitive
criteria
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
this
merger
should
or
should
not
be
effectual
with
it
because
of
the
public
interest.
i
suggest
what's
embraced
in
those
two
antitrust
laws,
hit
it
solely
on
competitive
situations.
whereas,
in
the
shipping
act
we
have
other
considerations
because
there
are
instances
where
a
segment
of
the
shipping
may
well
be
competitively
restrained.
it
well
may
be
that
there
is
an
absolute
monopoly,
this
is
true
perhaps
in
many
instances
with
port
areas
where
there
is
a
transaction
between
a
port
or
a
carrier
or
a
port
in
various
servicing
functions
in
that
port
which
would
fully
qualify
under
section
15.
they
would
fully
also
qualify
as
an
asset
under
section
7
standards.
but,
that
court,
that
area,
that
circle
it
is,
in
many
instances
is
a
monopoly
in
and
of
itself,
nobody
else
can
operate
this
because
it's
truly
done
by
some
public
type
authority.
now,
if
these
transactions
are
thrusting
to
district
court
i
believe
judge
merrell
in
the
matson
case
points
this
out.
you
would
have
this
paradox
where
for
under
one
set
of
standards
the
transaction
should
be
carried
out,
but
on
another
set
of
standards
the
transaction
should
fail
because
of
the
competitive
overtones
to
it
that
would
substantially
restrain
trade.
judge
merrell
in
matson
felt
that
this
is
just
an
impossible
situation
and
such
a
test
should
not
be
cast
to
federal
trade
commission
for
example
who
jointly
with
department
of
justice
entertains
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
section
7
standards.
now,
with
due
deference
to
our
sister
agency
they
may
be
very
specialized
in
competitive
relationships,
but
we
feel
maritime
commission
is
best
equipped
to
consider
what’s
necessary
for
our
commerce
in
terms
of
maritime
and
shipping
interests.
those
shipping
interests
when
we
speak
in
those
terms
also
extend
to
the
shipper
and
ultimately
to
the
consumer
in
the
final
analysis.
we
think
for
this
reason
that
based
on
these
two
considerations
that
the
commission
is
in
the
best
position
under
the
present
statutory
scheme
to
weigh
and
evaluate
the
policy
considerations
of
these
two
laws.
as
i
have
indicated
the
court
has
already
told
the
commission
that
it
has
to
take
in
consideration
antitrust
standards
when
it
makes
the
evaluations
under
section
15.
so
in
effect
what
you’re
doing
is
amoleriating
the
relationship
between
the
interest
under
the
clayton
act
for
example
together
with
the
interest
under
the
shipping
act
before
a
judgment
is
made
and
that
judgment
is
subsequently
reviewed
by
a
court
under
both
of
those
standards.
i
suggest
this
difference
in
policy
has
also
been
done
with
respect
to
other
statutes,
and
perhaps
the
one
most
significant
at
this
time
is
the
labor
statute
wherein
again
the
commission
was
sitting
in
a
position
or
a
had
a
role
wherein
it
had
to
look
both
two,
in
some
respects
labor
interest
as
well
as
the
shipping
interest
in
order
to
look
at
this
particular
transaction
and
pass
on
that.
i
would
suggest
that
my
agency
with
its
expertise,
with
its
flexibility
which
was
one
of
designs
of
an
administrative
agency
can
best
balance
both
of
those
considerations.
i
also
submit
that
if
this
is
thrown
into
the
court
on
the
antitrust
laws
too
frequently
those
other
considerations
of
other
statutes
including
the
shipping
act
statutes
will
fail
if
it’s
measured
solely
on
hard,
cold
sherman
act,
the
clayton
act
standards.
now,
an
argument
has
been
raised
and
it
was
also
suggested
in
the
court
below's
opinion
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
language
and
the
way
it’s
used
in
section
15
and
much
of
this
case
turns
on
how
that
section
15
language
is
going
to
be
read
is
it
that
there
was
an
implied
repeal
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
commission,
the
first
concede
that
the
document
of
antitrust
laws
not
repealed
by
implication
or
exemption
unless
fully
spelt
out.
we
fully
agree
with
that,
but
we
do
not
think
that’s
the
particular
case
in
this
instance.
we
think
section
15’s
language
is
hard,
cold
and
clear,
but
that
exemption
is
given
wherever
the
commission
properly
approves
the
transaction
in
the
section
15
standards.
but
as
been
cited,
contrary
to
our
position
have
been
other
types
of
cases
namely
the
north
producers
association
case,
the
federal
power
commission
case,
california
versus
federal
power
commission
and
the
us
versus
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
which
in
each
instance
was
an
extension
by
those
other
agencies
or
departments
of
antitrust
laws
to
associate
it
with
the
transaction
before
it
or
just
usurp
an
authority
that
was
really
not
there
on
the
first
place
and
they
went
off
on
an
implication
that
such
authority
must
have
been
meant
if
they
were
to
consider
these
antitrust
considerations.
i
also
submit
to
you
gentlemen
that
in
your
decision
the
united
states
versus
philadelphia
national
bank
you
will
look
to
the
federal
maritime
commission’s
law
to
explain
to
the
control
of
the
currency
that
here
is
an
instance
where
specific
statutory
authority
is
given
to
the
maritime
commission
to
exempt
such
transactions.
you
don't
have
this
strictly
by
implication.
another
argument
has
been
raised
and
in
an
effort
to
erode
what
the
commission
purports
to
have
as
its
jurisdiction,
is
the
specific
authority
that
has
been
given
two
other
sister
agencies,
namely
the
icc
and
cab.
those
agencies
are
looked
at
because
in
fact
it
is
true
that
there
is
specific
language
written
into
their
statutes
enabling
them
to
expressly
treat
questions
of
pooling,
questions
of
merger,
question
of
acquisitions,
etcetera.
but
i
would
like
briefly
to
go
back
a
little
bit
to
explain
how
that
statutory
language
and
those
other
statutes
came
into
existence
as
compared
with
the
federal
maritime
commissions.
and
when
the
federal
maritime
commission
act
was
passed
in
1916
that
antitrust
exemption
language
was
already
there.
the
drafters
of
legislative
history,
the
people
who
were
the
moving
forces
behind
the
shipping
act
recognized
the
antitrust
overtones
involved
with
shipping
both
domestic
and
in
the
international
boarders,
and
was
real
certain
that
this
type
of
exemption
is
going
to
be
squarely
put
into
the
federal
maritime
commission
act,
i
am
sorry,
the
shipping
act
of
1916.
now,
this
wasn’t
true
with
the
icc
act
that
was
originally
passed,
the
organic
statute
in
1887.
they
did
not
have
any
such
antitrust
exemption.
in
fact,
that
act,
what
has
come
to
be
known
today
may
express
prohibition
against
pooling
in
the
icc,
was
to
declare
those
illegal
under
any
circumstances
and
it
wasn’t
until
1912
that
some
further
consideration
was
given
under
the
panama
canal
act
as
to
acquisitions
and
mergers
and
relationships
concerning
railroads
and
shipping
interest
in
the
united
states.
that
the
icc
act
was
amended
so
as
to
enjoin
railroads
primarily
from
acquiring
shipping
interest
that
would
be
competitive
or
if
they
acquired
this
interest
to
enjoying
them
from
using
the
panama
canal.
but,
we
still
don't
feel
at
1912
is
that
any
history
has
bearing
upon
the
maritime
commission's
authority
that
was
given
to
it
some
four
years
later
with
all
of
this
background
in
mind.
by
1920
the
icc
act
was
again
amended.
this
time
to
approve
pooling
and
to
permit
certain
types
of
consolidations,
and
in
1920
i
think
the
thinking
behind
that
law
was
to
allow
some
of
our
railroads
to
consolidate,
merge
and
therefore
the
icc
was
supposed
to
undertake
a
study
or
come
up
with
the
plan
for
extending
its
railroad
systems
in
the
united
states.
and
this
more
or
less
was
really
not
accomplished.
they
played
with
it
for
a
while
and
was
not
to
efficacious
insofar
as
later
legislation
was
drafted.
so
by
1933
the
authority
had
been
given,
the
icc
devised
these
plans
have
been
taken
back
and
icc
was
just
given
broad
authority
to
improve
various
types
of
acquisitions
and
mergers
in
railroad
industry
and
to
give
antitrust
exemptions
with
such
acquisitions
and
mergers.
now,
again
i
say
this
is
1933,
meanwhile
the
federal
maritime
commission
throughout
has
had
this
antitrust
authority,
it
was
written
in
broad
language.
in
fact,
the
language
is
sometimes
been
characterized
to
that
the
sherman
act
where
it
is
very
simple,
it
just
says
an
agreement
that
restrains
or
prevents
or
stops
competition
is
covered
by
the
section
15.
by
1940,
there
was
another
amendment
to
the
icc
act.
in
this
there
were
certain
grandfather
rights
given
and
a
codification,
but
it
had
no
immediate
bearing
on
icc’s
authority
or
power
that
was
specifically
developed
over
a
period
of
some
40
years
to
give
this
express
antitrust
authority
to
certain
types
of
transactions
that
really
grew
up
as
a
result
of
the
industry
structure
of
the
railroads
and
overland
transportation
in
the
united
states.
i
would
submit
that
with
respect
to
this
icc
act
the
present
bearing
of
that
express
language
in
icc,
i
don’t
think
can
be
used
to
say
that
with
icc
being
given
this
as
new
situations
cropped
up
and
presented
themselves
in
the
railroad
and
overland
trucking
industry
and
so
on
and
that’s
a
denial
that
the
federal
maritime
commission
had
such
general
authority
way
back
in
1916
when
the
law
was
enacted.
so
too
with
cab
when
that
act
was
originally
passed
in
1938
and
they
looked
to
that
--
to
various
statutes
and
cab
was
given
specific
authority
both
in
section
402
in
general
authority
in
section
412,
but
again,
the
language
of
both
of
those
sections
of
the
cab
statute
is
expressly
tailored
again
to
aviation
or
to
airlines
or
to
airplane
industry
and
because
by
certain
qualifiers
it
has,
it
just
doesn’t
necessarily
apply
to
the
type
of
problems
that
the
maritime
commission
runs
into.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
neither
section
408
or
section
412,
even
though
it
gives
express
grants
to
cab
in
any
way
derives
or
undermines
the
general
authority
given
to
federal
maritime
commission
back
in
1916.
with
respect
to
how
the
commission
and
the
courts
and
for
that
matter
of
fact,
congress
has
looked
at
this
authority
given
to
the
commission
in
1916,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
1915
amendments
that
were
made
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
there
is
some
argument
here
whether
or
not
we’re
looking
to
post
enactment
legislative
history
so
to
speak
for
coming
up
with
what
the
congress
thinks
some
30
or
so
years
after
the
shipping
act
was
amended,
but
nonetheless,
it
certainly
shows
that
the
congress
at
that
time
was
fully
aware.
it
shows
that
the
commission
at
that
time
had
the
intent
to
have
its
jurisdiction
applied
to
acquisitions
and
mergers.
section
7,
as
you
recall,
was
amended
to
include
that
asset,
as
well
as,
stock
acquisitions
under
its
coverage.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
a
specific
exception
section
written
into
section
7
at
that
time.
there
is
some
reference
in
one
of
the
committee
reports
that
this
exemption
language
was
not
intended
to
give
any
further
rights
than
a
particular
agency
already
had.
certainly
the
argument
is
there
that
if
the
agency
had
no
rights
they
wouldn't
have
put
this
exception
in,
in
the
first
place.
the
commission
made
itself
very
plain,
while
it
appeared
and
testified
in
connection
with
this
amendment
in
1950,
that
it
had
this
authority,
it
had
this
power
and
was
exercising
it
and
there
was
no
challenge
by
either
the
congress
or
its
members
or
for
that
matter
of
fact
the
department
of
justice
at
that
time
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
authority
properly
being
exercised
by
the
federal
maritime
commission.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
it’s
a
recognition
of
the
existence
of
that,
but
i
will
come
to
that
point
in
a
second.
this
type
of
thinking
mr.
justice
also
prevailed
throughout
the
senate
hearings
in
the
senate
reports
when
the
commission
was
again
put
under
the
congressional
microscope
as
to
how
it
was
operating
under
its
new
structure,
and
namely
it
was
reconstituted,
i
guess
it’s
under
the
executive
order
7
of
1960
and
you
now
had
a
new
type
of
regulatory
agency
that
they
were
looking
at,
rather
closely
as
to
see
how
they
were
carrying
it
out.
their
functions,
particularly
with
respect
to
mergers
and
acquisitions
and
concentrations
on
the
shipping
industry.
and
throughout
those
senate
hearings
and
senate
reports
there
is
constant
reference
of
the
commission
having
this
authority
and
exercising
this
authority
and
we
have
searched
and
i
have
not
met
with
any
authority
to
the
contrary,
in
any
part
of
those
hearing
is
that
the
commission
was
ever
denied
having
this.
along
this
line
in
1958
there
was
a
major
decision
by
this
court
in
[inaudible]
line
wherein
the
question
of
dual
rates
under
shipping
act
came
into
play
and
this
court
found
that
the
statute
as
it
was
then
constituted
did
not
cover
these
types
of
transactions
and
they
would
be
subjugating
trust
laws
and
i
believe
there
is
immediate
congressional
action
to
extend
the
period
of
time
before
these
became
unlawful
so
that
they
could
look
to
shipping
act
and
perhaps
include
some
amendments
which
they
subsequently
did.
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
this
for
just
briefly
because
those
amendments,
those
1961
amendments,
the
shipping
act
and
particularly
section
15
did
make
substantial
revision
under
the
law
that
we
are
currently
talking
about
here.
there
were
additions,
there
were
new
procedures,
there
was
a
new
public
interest
test,
that
was
introduced
into
that
section
15
amendment
in
1961.
and
some
of
these
of
course
flowed
as
the
result
of
these
plans
and
decisions,
some
two
years
or
three
years
earlier
also
to
include
the
coverage
under
the
new
section
14b
relating
to
dual
rates.
now,
arguably
this
amendment
to
section
15
in
1961
allowed
congress
to
re-look
at
what
it
did.
it
had
at
that
time
all
the
language
of
section
15
and
it
reviewed
that
language
and
that
reviewed
section
15
provisions
deleting
some
and
including
new
ones.
so
that
there
was
almost
a
complete
overhaul
or
as
some
referred
to
it,
a
reenactment
of
section
15
with
that
congressional
intent
real
clear.
now
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
from
our
reading,
or
from
what
has
been
reported
on
that
and
that’s
the
language
that
we’re
essentially
faced
with
today.
throughout
those
hearings
and
the
amendments
leading
to
it,
the
justice
department
had
appeared
and
was
given
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
issue
but
did
not
address
itself
to
it,
did
not
object.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
i
would
like
to
add
only
one
point
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
i
did
not
address
myself
to
that,
because
there
is
really
nothing
definitive
in
the
legislative
history
one
way
or
another.
mr.
seibel
has
addressed
himself
in
his
brief
very
appropriately
as
to
what
it
says.
one,
we
think
we
have
equally
covered
the
ground
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
other
side
of
the
brief
is
to
what
it
says
on
the
other
side.
we
believe
justice
stewart
in
volkswagen
points
out
one
particular
section
of
the
committee's
recommendation
wherein
he
especially
covers
agreements
by
vessels
engaged
in
the
falling
commerce
to
united
states.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
raise
one
further
question
as
with
the
schematics
of
putting
section
15
together
about
clause
3
as
standing
out
or
being
the
single
exception
to
all
the
other
ongoing
type
of
clauses.
i
submit
your
honor
if
this
is
what
the
committee
had
in
the
back
of
their
mind
we
could
have
eliminated
clause
3
completely,
because
it
wouldn't
have
been
covered
by
clause
7
according
to
mr.
seibel,
my
brother
seibel's
discussion.
we
think
this
court
should
reverse
the
court
below
and
finds
that
the
commission
does
have
authority
through
the
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
as
with
mergers
and
acquisitions.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
practical
question
here
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
that
the
federal
maritime
commission
is
going
to
be
able
to
continue
under
its
present
statutory
authority
to
effectively
regulate
and
supervise
america’s
maritime
industry.
the
matter
here
this
morning
comes
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
which
vacated
the
federal
maritime
commission
order
approving
the
merger
of
assets
of
one
shipping
company
to
that
of
another
shipping
company.
in
overruling
the
commission's
order,
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
under
section
15
of
the
shipping
act,
authorizing
it
to
approve
such
sales
thereby
giving
such
transactions'
immunity
under
the
antitrust
laws.
so
that
we’re
real
certain
as
to
what
the
facts
of
the
situation
is.
in
this
particular
case
along
about
1970
pacific
far
east
lines
entered
into
in
a
contract
with
one
of
matson's
subsidiaries,
oceanic
steamship
company,
to
sale
of
four
ships
then
in
operation,
two
ships
that
were
under
construction
and
associated
facilities
like
personnel
and
so
on
that
along
with
those
ships.
there
was
a
protest
on
this
matter
at
commission
level.
the
commission
finding
this
protest
without
substance
and
upon
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
parties,
approved
the
transaction,
it
was
immediately
appealed
by
the
protestants
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
the
question
was
raised
for
the
first
time
as
to
the
commission's
section
15
jurisdiction
over
this
type
of
transaction.
since
the
language
of
section
15
is
so
critical
to
our
understanding
this
morning,
i
would
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
page
two
of
our
brief
or
to
the
language
of
section
15
itself,
in
the
first
or
second
paragraph
i
believe,
wherein,
the
third
clause
or
category
says
“that
agreements
between
carriers
shall
be
committed
to
commission
which
are
controlling,
regulating,
preventing,
or
destroying
competition.”
now,
in
addition
to
that
this
paragraph
goes
on
to
indicate
that
agreements
also
include
understandings,
conferences
and
other
arrangements.
section
15
also
makes
specific
provision
for
an
antitrust
exemption,
for
agreements
that
have
come
before
the
commission
and
are
lawfully
approved.
now,
the
commission
has
operated
with
this
law
for
over
two
decades
approving
some
transactions
formally,
others
informally,
and
even
rejecting
some
transactions
that
had
been
presented
to
it.
the
question
presented
here
today
was
really
not
raised
in
the
judicial
setting
until
1968,
some
time
after
the
commission
had
been
operating
with
this
law
and
approving
merger
and
acquisition,
consolidation
transactions
when
before
the
commission
and
subsequently
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
last
clause
of
the
first
paragraph
in
section
15
which
is
a
sort
of
a
catch-all
clause
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph
and
reads
“or
in
any
manner
providing
for
an
exclusive
preferential
or
cooperative
working
arrangement
whether
or
not
that
clause
limits
the
foregoing
six
categories
under
the
shipping
act,
they
are
to
be
presented
to
the
commission.”
now,
this
clause
was
originally
rejected
in
the
ninth
circuit
court,
and
met
by
matson
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
case,
on
the
basis
of
justice
stewart’s
decision
in
volkswagen
wherein,
he
indicted
that
section
15
and
the
language
used
in
that
part
of
the
statute
is
very
broad
and
is
very
expansive
and
probably
would
not
be
circumscribed
by
these
other
–
this
one
category
at
the
end
of
section
15.
now,
i
think
it's
important
here
for
us
to
understand
the
type
of
industry
that
we’re
operating
in
and
i
think
it
should
be
immediately
apparent
that
we’re
really
having
problems
reconciling
two
conflicting
statutes
or
perhaps
three
conflicting
statutes,
namely
the
shipping
act,
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act.
but
we
submit
first
of
all
that
the
initial
purpose
and
concept
behind
enactment
of
the
shipping
act
back
in
1916
was
to
create
a
specialized
and
expert
agency
to
regulate
maritime
affairs.
now,
if
this
was
the
goal
or
the
objective
behind
the
original
shipping
act
then
maritime
commission
would
not
be
able
to
accomplish
this
if
it
has
one
arm
tied
behind
its
back
so
to
speak,
being
unable
to
act
or
to
oversee
transactions
that
may
involve
mergers
or
consolidations
or
acquisitions
between
shipping
companies.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
not
that
i
know
off,
no
sir.
there
is
no
recorded,
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
it
well
might
have
been
that
the
papers
had
been
submitted
to
it,
but
we
have
no
reference
of
any
recorded
transaction,
that
it
had
acted
unofficially,
no
sir.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
in
this
connection
if
may
mr.
justice
blackmun,
suggest
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
structure
of
the
maritime
agency
back
in
1960
when
the
regulatory
arm
was
split
off
from
the
promotion
arm
of
the
maritime
industry
insofar
as
government
regulation
was
concerned.
it
was
when
this
regulatory
arm,
namely
the
federal
maritime
commission
was
setup
for
the
purpose
of
effectively
regulating
the
shipping
act
statutes
it
became
much
more
concerned
and
interested
in
the
various
transactions
that
were
going
on
in
the
maritime
industry
insofar
as
acquisitions
and
mergers
were
concerned.
i
suggest
gentlemen
that
with
these
two
conflicting
statutory
goals,
namely
the
goal
of
the
antitrust
law
to
preserve
a
competitive
environment
and
the
goal
of
the
shipping
act
which
uses
antitrust
standards
as
only
one
of
the
criterion.
the
commission
has
looked
upon
these
transactions
in
the
past,
endeavored
to
balance
both
of
these
conflicting
public
policy
aims.
i
suggest
that
in
treating
this
question
for
example
if
justice
for
example
were
to
prevail,
the
department
of
justice
on
this,
we
would
have
two
different
types
of
transactions
very
closely
related,
but
entirely
judged
by
different
standards.
it's
been
suggested
in
the
brief
for
example
that
a
single
ship
sale
to
an
area
where
service
may
be
needed
could
by
justice
department's
move
or
the
federal
trade
commission
for
that
matter
of
fact
enjoin
that
if
it
had
the
--
if
it
met
the
tests
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
transaction
was
viewed
only
as
limiting
competition
or
tending
towards
monopoly.
now,
the
maritime
commission
i
believe
has
a
bigger
goal
or
a
bigger
objective
than
this
under
the
shipping
act.
the
standards
given
to
that
were
several
sets
of
standards
aside
from
purely
competitor
standards.
and
those
included
--
and
i
think
they
are
also
listed
in
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
transaction
would
be
unjustly
discriminatory
or
unfair
between
carriers
and
suppliers
whether
or
not
it
would
operate
to
the
determent
of
the
commerce
of
united
states,
whether
it
would
be
in
violation
of
any
other
shipping
act
provision,
or
whether
it
would
be
contrary
to
public
interest.
now,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
contrary
to
public
interest
has
been
read
by
this
court
as
including
antitrust
standards.
that
appeared
i
believe
in
the
decision
of
svenska
where
the
court
read
right
into
it,
that
the
commission
could
not
ignore
antitrust
considerations
in
passing
or
making
rulings
on
any
of
the
transactions
coming
in
before
it
for
approval
under
section
15
or
upon
which
the
commission
may
act
on
its
own
motion
with
respect
to
some
transactions.
now,
there
has
been
a
question
here
presented
as
to
whether
or
not
since
the
transaction
is
discrete,
consummated,
completed
so
to
speak,
it
is
not
stayed
according
to
lower
court
perhaps
by
having
a
conditional
covenant
or
some
type
of
replicable
or
reversionary
interest
of
follow
the
sail
of
the
ship
or
the
closing
of
an
acquisition
transaction.
the
commission
has
great
doubts
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
very
practical
approach
because
it
soon
becomes
a
technique
in
the
way
you
would
draft
acquisition
agreements.
the
court
below
has
listed
a
series
of
cases,
all
of
which
it
points
to
is
containing
some
sort
of
covenant
not
to
compete.
but
those
are
not
unusual
in
merger
acquisition
transactions
if
you’re
buying
somebody
out
and
still
we
don't
feel
that’s
crucial
or
critical
enough
to
stay
this
type
of
transaction
from
going
under
antitrust
judgment.
in
other
words,
we
believe
it
has
stayed
fully
under
the
shipping
act
in
all
respects.
now,
i
believe
one
of
the
problems
here
that
is
posed
most
importantly
with
respect
to
policy
consideration
is
basically
this.
that
when
a
transaction
comes
before
the
commission
whether
it's
in
the
form
of
an
acquisition
and
merger,
the
question
always
is
raised
is,
is
this
going
to
be
tested
strictly
by
competitive
standards
or
is
it
going
to
be
tested
by
that
criteria
that
i
have
explained
to
you
under
the
shipping
act,
section
15.
now,
if
the
transaction
is
to
be
tested
either
by
the
federal
trade
commission
or
by
the
department
of
justice
in
the
court
some
place
strictly
on
competitive
standards,
frequently
the
transactions
will
fall,
even
though
it
may
well
satisfy
all
the
other
standards
of
the
shipping
act
and
even
though
it
may
in
the
overall
view
be
in
the
best
public
interest.
but,
neither
the
federal
trade
commission
operating
under
the
authority
of
clayton
act
section
7
nor
the
department
of
justice
either
under
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act
could
stray
too
far
from
that
set
competitive
criteria
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
this
merger
should
or
should
not
be
effectual
with
it
because
of
the
public
interest.
i
suggest
what's
embraced
in
those
two
antitrust
laws,
hit
it
solely
on
competitive
situations.
whereas,
in
the
shipping
act
we
have
other
considerations
because
there
are
instances
where
a
segment
of
the
shipping
may
well
be
competitively
restrained.
it
well
may
be
that
there
is
an
absolute
monopoly,
this
is
true
perhaps
in
many
instances
with
port
areas
where
there
is
a
transaction
between
a
port
or
a
carrier
or
a
port
in
various
servicing
functions
in
that
port
which
would
fully
qualify
under
section
15.
they
would
fully
also
qualify
as
an
asset
under
section
7
standards.
but,
that
court,
that
area,
that
circle
it
is,
in
many
instances
is
a
monopoly
in
and
of
itself,
nobody
else
can
operate
this
because
it's
truly
done
by
some
public
type
authority.
now,
if
these
transactions
are
thrusting
to
district
court
i
believe
judge
merrell
in
the
matson
case
points
this
out.
you
would
have
this
paradox
where
for
under
one
set
of
standards
the
transaction
should
be
carried
out,
but
on
another
set
of
standards
the
transaction
should
fail
because
of
the
competitive
overtones
to
it
that
would
substantially
restrain
trade.
judge
merrell
in
matson
felt
that
this
is
just
an
impossible
situation
and
such
a
test
should
not
be
cast
to
federal
trade
commission
for
example
who
jointly
with
department
of
justice
entertains
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
section
7
standards.
now,
with
due
deference
to
our
sister
agency
they
may
be
very
specialized
in
competitive
relationships,
but
we
feel
maritime
commission
is
best
equipped
to
consider
what’s
necessary
for
our
commerce
in
terms
of
maritime
and
shipping
interests.
those
shipping
interests
when
we
speak
in
those
terms
also
extend
to
the
shipper
and
ultimately
to
the
consumer
in
the
final
analysis.
we
think
for
this
reason
that
based
on
these
two
considerations
that
the
commission
is
in
the
best
position
under
the
present
statutory
scheme
to
weigh
and
evaluate
the
policy
considerations
of
these
two
laws.
as
i
have
indicated
the
court
has
already
told
the
commission
that
it
has
to
take
in
consideration
antitrust
standards
when
it
makes
the
evaluations
under
section
15.
so
in
effect
what
you’re
doing
is
amoleriating
the
relationship
between
the
interest
under
the
clayton
act
for
example
together
with
the
interest
under
the
shipping
act
before
a
judgment
is
made
and
that
judgment
is
subsequently
reviewed
by
a
court
under
both
of
those
standards.
i
suggest
this
difference
in
policy
has
also
been
done
with
respect
to
other
statutes,
and
perhaps
the
one
most
significant
at
this
time
is
the
labor
statute
wherein
again
the
commission
was
sitting
in
a
position
or
a
had
a
role
wherein
it
had
to
look
both
two,
in
some
respects
labor
interest
as
well
as
the
shipping
interest
in
order
to
look
at
this
particular
transaction
and
pass
on
that.
i
would
suggest
that
my
agency
with
its
expertise,
with
its
flexibility
which
was
one
of
designs
of
an
administrative
agency
can
best
balance
both
of
those
considerations.
i
also
submit
that
if
this
is
thrown
into
the
court
on
the
antitrust
laws
too
frequently
those
other
considerations
of
other
statutes
including
the
shipping
act
statutes
will
fail
if
it’s
measured
solely
on
hard,
cold
sherman
act,
the
clayton
act
standards.
now,
an
argument
has
been
raised
and
it
was
also
suggested
in
the
court
below's
opinion
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
language
and
the
way
it’s
used
in
section
15
and
much
of
this
case
turns
on
how
that
section
15
language
is
going
to
be
read
is
it
that
there
was
an
implied
repeal
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
commission,
the
first
concede
that
the
document
of
antitrust
laws
not
repealed
by
implication
or
exemption
unless
fully
spelt
out.
we
fully
agree
with
that,
but
we
do
not
think
that’s
the
particular
case
in
this
instance.
we
think
section
15’s
language
is
hard,
cold
and
clear,
but
that
exemption
is
given
wherever
the
commission
properly
approves
the
transaction
in
the
section
15
standards.
but
as
been
cited,
contrary
to
our
position
have
been
other
types
of
cases
namely
the
north
producers
association
case,
the
federal
power
commission
case,
california
versus
federal
power
commission
and
the
us
versus
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
which
in
each
instance
was
an
extension
by
those
other
agencies
or
departments
of
antitrust
laws
to
associate
it
with
the
transaction
before
it
or
just
usurp
an
authority
that
was
really
not
there
on
the
first
place
and
they
went
off
on
an
implication
that
such
authority
must
have
been
meant
if
they
were
to
consider
these
antitrust
considerations.
i
also
submit
to
you
gentlemen
that
in
your
decision
the
united
states
versus
philadelphia
national
bank
you
will
look
to
the
federal
maritime
commission’s
law
to
explain
to
the
control
of
the
currency
that
here
is
an
instance
where
specific
statutory
authority
is
given
to
the
maritime
commission
to
exempt
such
transactions.
you
don't
have
this
strictly
by
implication.
another
argument
has
been
raised
and
in
an
effort
to
erode
what
the
commission
purports
to
have
as
its
jurisdiction,
is
the
specific
authority
that
has
been
given
two
other
sister
agencies,
namely
the
icc
and
cab.
those
agencies
are
looked
at
because
in
fact
it
is
true
that
there
is
specific
language
written
into
their
statutes
enabling
them
to
expressly
treat
questions
of
pooling,
questions
of
merger,
question
of
acquisitions,
etcetera.
but
i
would
like
briefly
to
go
back
a
little
bit
to
explain
how
that
statutory
language
and
those
other
statutes
came
into
existence
as
compared
with
the
federal
maritime
commissions.
and
when
the
federal
maritime
commission
act
was
passed
in
1916
that
antitrust
exemption
language
was
already
there.
the
drafters
of
legislative
history,
the
people
who
were
the
moving
forces
behind
the
shipping
act
recognized
the
antitrust
overtones
involved
with
shipping
both
domestic
and
in
the
international
boarders,
and
was
real
certain
that
this
type
of
exemption
is
going
to
be
squarely
put
into
the
federal
maritime
commission
act,
i
am
sorry,
the
shipping
act
of
1916.
now,
this
wasn’t
true
with
the
icc
act
that
was
originally
passed,
the
organic
statute
in
1887.
they
did
not
have
any
such
antitrust
exemption.
in
fact,
that
act,
what
has
come
to
be
known
today
may
express
prohibition
against
pooling
in
the
icc,
was
to
declare
those
illegal
under
any
circumstances
and
it
wasn’t
until
1912
that
some
further
consideration
was
given
under
the
panama
canal
act
as
to
acquisitions
and
mergers
and
relationships
concerning
railroads
and
shipping
interest
in
the
united
states.
that
the
icc
act
was
amended
so
as
to
enjoin
railroads
primarily
from
acquiring
shipping
interest
that
would
be
competitive
or
if
they
acquired
this
interest
to
enjoying
them
from
using
the
panama
canal.
but,
we
still
don't
feel
at
1912
is
that
any
history
has
bearing
upon
the
maritime
commission's
authority
that
was
given
to
it
some
four
years
later
with
all
of
this
background
in
mind.
by
1920
the
icc
act
was
again
amended.
this
time
to
approve
pooling
and
to
permit
certain
types
of
consolidations,
and
in
1920
i
think
the
thinking
behind
that
law
was
to
allow
some
of
our
railroads
to
consolidate,
merge
and
therefore
the
icc
was
supposed
to
undertake
a
study
or
come
up
with
the
plan
for
extending
its
railroad
systems
in
the
united
states.
and
this
more
or
less
was
really
not
accomplished.
they
played
with
it
for
a
while
and
was
not
to
efficacious
insofar
as
later
legislation
was
drafted.
so
by
1933
the
authority
had
been
given,
the
icc
devised
these
plans
have
been
taken
back
and
icc
was
just
given
broad
authority
to
improve
various
types
of
acquisitions
and
mergers
in
railroad
industry
and
to
give
antitrust
exemptions
with
such
acquisitions
and
mergers.
now,
again
i
say
this
is
1933,
meanwhile
the
federal
maritime
commission
throughout
has
had
this
antitrust
authority,
it
was
written
in
broad
language.
in
fact,
the
language
is
sometimes
been
characterized
to
that
the
sherman
act
where
it
is
very
simple,
it
just
says
an
agreement
that
restrains
or
prevents
or
stops
competition
is
covered
by
the
section
15.
by
1940,
there
was
another
amendment
to
the
icc
act.
in
this
there
were
certain
grandfather
rights
given
and
a
codification,
but
it
had
no
immediate
bearing
on
icc’s
authority
or
power
that
was
specifically
developed
over
a
period
of
some
40
years
to
give
this
express
antitrust
authority
to
certain
types
of
transactions
that
really
grew
up
as
a
result
of
the
industry
structure
of
the
railroads
and
overland
transportation
in
the
united
states.
i
would
submit
that
with
respect
to
this
icc
act
the
present
bearing
of
that
express
language
in
icc,
i
don’t
think
can
be
used
to
say
that
with
icc
being
given
this
as
new
situations
cropped
up
and
presented
themselves
in
the
railroad
and
overland
trucking
industry
and
so
on
and
that’s
a
denial
that
the
federal
maritime
commission
had
such
general
authority
way
back
in
1916
when
the
law
was
enacted.
so
too
with
cab
when
that
act
was
originally
passed
in
1938
and
they
looked
to
that
--
to
various
statutes
and
cab
was
given
specific
authority
both
in
section
402
in
general
authority
in
section
412,
but
again,
the
language
of
both
of
those
sections
of
the
cab
statute
is
expressly
tailored
again
to
aviation
or
to
airlines
or
to
airplane
industry
and
because
by
certain
qualifiers
it
has,
it
just
doesn’t
necessarily
apply
to
the
type
of
problems
that
the
maritime
commission
runs
into.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
neither
section
408
or
section
412,
even
though
it
gives
express
grants
to
cab
in
any
way
derives
or
undermines
the
general
authority
given
to
federal
maritime
commission
back
in
1916.
with
respect
to
how
the
commission
and
the
courts
and
for
that
matter
of
fact,
congress
has
looked
at
this
authority
given
to
the
commission
in
1916,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
1915
amendments
that
were
made
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
there
is
some
argument
here
whether
or
not
we’re
looking
to
post
enactment
legislative
history
so
to
speak
for
coming
up
with
what
the
congress
thinks
some
30
or
so
years
after
the
shipping
act
was
amended,
but
nonetheless,
it
certainly
shows
that
the
congress
at
that
time
was
fully
aware.
it
shows
that
the
commission
at
that
time
had
the
intent
to
have
its
jurisdiction
applied
to
acquisitions
and
mergers.
section
7,
as
you
recall,
was
amended
to
include
that
asset,
as
well
as,
stock
acquisitions
under
its
coverage.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
a
specific
exception
section
written
into
section
7
at
that
time.
there
is
some
reference
in
one
of
the
committee
reports
that
this
exemption
language
was
not
intended
to
give
any
further
rights
than
a
particular
agency
already
had.
certainly
the
argument
is
there
that
if
the
agency
had
no
rights
they
wouldn't
have
put
this
exception
in,
in
the
first
place.
the
commission
made
itself
very
plain,
while
it
appeared
and
testified
in
connection
with
this
amendment
in
1950,
that
it
had
this
authority,
it
had
this
power
and
was
exercising
it
and
there
was
no
challenge
by
either
the
congress
or
its
members
or
for
that
matter
of
fact
the
department
of
justice
at
that
time
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
authority
properly
being
exercised
by
the
federal
maritime
commission.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
it’s
a
recognition
of
the
existence
of
that,
but
i
will
come
to
that
point
in
a
second.
this
type
of
thinking
mr.
justice
also
prevailed
throughout
the
senate
hearings
in
the
senate
reports
when
the
commission
was
again
put
under
the
congressional
microscope
as
to
how
it
was
operating
under
its
new
structure,
and
namely
it
was
reconstituted,
i
guess
it’s
under
the
executive
order
7
of
1960
and
you
now
had
a
new
type
of
regulatory
agency
that
they
were
looking
at,
rather
closely
as
to
see
how
they
were
carrying
it
out.
their
functions,
particularly
with
respect
to
mergers
and
acquisitions
and
concentrations
on
the
shipping
industry.
and
throughout
those
senate
hearings
and
senate
reports
there
is
constant
reference
of
the
commission
having
this
authority
and
exercising
this
authority
and
we
have
searched
and
i
have
not
met
with
any
authority
to
the
contrary,
in
any
part
of
those
hearing
is
that
the
commission
was
ever
denied
having
this.
along
this
line
in
1958
there
was
a
major
decision
by
this
court
in
[inaudible]
line
wherein
the
question
of
dual
rates
under
shipping
act
came
into
play
and
this
court
found
that
the
statute
as
it
was
then
constituted
did
not
cover
these
types
of
transactions
and
they
would
be
subjugating
trust
laws
and
i
believe
there
is
immediate
congressional
action
to
extend
the
period
of
time
before
these
became
unlawful
so
that
they
could
look
to
shipping
act
and
perhaps
include
some
amendments
which
they
subsequently
did.
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
this
for
just
briefly
because
those
amendments,
those
1961
amendments,
the
shipping
act
and
particularly
section
15
did
make
substantial
revision
under
the
law
that
we
are
currently
talking
about
here.
there
were
additions,
there
were
new
procedures,
there
was
a
new
public
interest
test,
that
was
introduced
into
that
section
15
amendment
in
1961.
and
some
of
these
of
course
flowed
as
the
result
of
these
plans
and
decisions,
some
two
years
or
three
years
earlier
also
to
include
the
coverage
under
the
new
section
14b
relating
to
dual
rates.
now,
arguably
this
amendment
to
section
15
in
1961
allowed
congress
to
re-look
at
what
it
did.
it
had
at
that
time
all
the
language
of
section
15
and
it
reviewed
that
language
and
that
reviewed
section
15
provisions
deleting
some
and
including
new
ones.
so
that
there
was
almost
a
complete
overhaul
or
as
some
referred
to
it,
a
reenactment
of
section
15
with
that
congressional
intent
real
clear.
now
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
from
our
reading,
or
from
what
has
been
reported
on
that
and
that’s
the
language
that
we’re
essentially
faced
with
today.
throughout
those
hearings
and
the
amendments
leading
to
it,
the
justice
department
had
appeared
and
was
given
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
issue
but
did
not
address
itself
to
it,
did
not
object.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
g.
gruis
i
would
like
to
add
only
one
point
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
i
did
not
address
myself
to
that,
because
there
is
really
nothing
definitive
in
the
legislative
history
one
way
or
another.
mr.
seibel
has
addressed
himself
in
his
brief
very
appropriately
as
to
what
it
says.
one,
we
think
we
have
equally
covered
the
ground
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
other
side
of
the
brief
is
to
what
it
says
on
the
other
side.
we
believe
justice
stewart
in
volkswagen
points
out
one
particular
section
of
the
committee's
recommendation
wherein
he
especially
covers
agreements
by
vessels
engaged
in
the
falling
commerce
to
united
states.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
raise
one
further
question
as
with
the
schematics
of
putting
section
15
together
about
clause
3
as
standing
out
or
being
the
single
exception
to
all
the
other
ongoing
type
of
clauses.
i
submit
your
honor
if
this
is
what
the
committee
had
in
the
back
of
their
mind
we
could
have
eliminated
clause
3
completely,
because
it
wouldn't
have
been
covered
by
clause
7
according
to
mr.
seibel,
my
brother
seibel's
discussion.
we
think
this
court
should
reverse
the
court
below
and
finds
that
the
commission
does
have
authority
through
the
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
as
with
mergers
and
acquisitions.
thank
you,
your
honor.
