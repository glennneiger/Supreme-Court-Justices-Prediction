mr.

you
may

you’re

chief

what
would
be
your
position
if
he
had
found
an
illegal
alien
under

chief

e.

i
thought
you
were
making
some
of
distinctions
there.
chief

warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
constitutional
difference
between
three
miles
and
100
miles
in
your
view?
you
now
indicate
the
three
miles
might
be
reasonable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
you
wouldn’t
allow
any
distance
away
from
the
boarder?
chief

e.

well,
50

counsel
seems
to

would
you
help

officer?
just
let

sit
down
and
we’ll
just
relax.
perhaps
you
should
call
mrs.

we’ll

--
counsel,
i
think
what
we’ll
do
is
take
a
five

10
minutes
recess
until

next
in

almeida-sanchez
against

mr.
cleary.
chief
justice
warren
e.

but
would
we
fix
that
mr.
cleary
in
terms
of
37
½
miles
or
would
we
say
a
reasonable
distance
in
the
context
of
the
geographical
area
in
which
it
occurred,
which
way
would
we

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
didn't
come
through
customs,
then
would
not
his
strong
position
be
that
he
is
just
a
local
fellow
who
is
out
for
a
ride
and
he
had
never
been
to
mexico
in
his
life?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
the
regulation
by
its
terms
apply
to
border
crossers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
anybody
made
an
estimate
of
how
many
people
it
would
take
to
cover
that
2,083-mile
border?
chief

e.

with
the
kind
of
mechanism
you
are
suggesting?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
cleary,
as
long
as
you
have
got
into
these
practical
things,
you
probably
are
--
since
you
live
down
there,
recall
at
one
point,
they
tried
making
a
search
of
every
car
coming
across
the
border
and
provoked
as
you
recall
an
international
incident.
mexico
wouldn't
stand
for
it
and
quite
many
other
people
wouldn't.
there
are
practical
difficulties
that
are
hard
to
crossover,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
is
not
that
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
federal
government
has
the
exclusive
control
of
the
borders
in
the
example
you
give?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
federal
government
can't
permit
each
one
of
border
states
to
have
its
own
customs
control,
could
they?
chief

warren
e.

very
well
mr.

mr.
lacovara?
chief

warren
e.

we
have
a

which
shows
that
one
of

mexicans,
are
very
small
size
person
under
the

was
almost
dead
when
they
opened
the
hood
and
let
him
out?
chief

so
that
merely
looking
in

is
not

the
checking

chief

we'll
resume
there
after
lunch.[luncheon
recess]
mr.
lacovara,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
as
you
concede
that
in
san
antonio,
this
would
not
wash?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
far
is
san
antonio
from
the
border?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
relatively
short.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
those
circumstances
that
justice
white
was
probing
at,
isn't
one
of
the
circumstances
that
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
this
is
identified
as
a
habitual
smuggling
route
and
road?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
the
wide
open
area
in
which
you
have
enormous
difficulty
making
checks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
told
us
before,
mr.
lacovara,
i
did
not
take
note
of
it.
what
checkpoints
are
in
the
range
of
this
map
of
the
orders,
any
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
one
that
goes
northeast
from
the
circled
city?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cleary,
we
know
of
course
that
a
border
line
is
simply
a
hypothetical
line,
a
thin
line
made
by
map
maker
with
a
pen.
is
there
a
constitutional
barrier
do
you
think
for
congress
to
set
up
a
sanitare
zone
as
it
were
and
say
that
the
border
is
going
to
be
three
miles
or
five
miles
wide
from
the
identifiable
international
boundary,
three
miles,
five
miles
back,
this
is
boundary
borders
as
far
as
the
united
states
immigration
and
custom
services
are
concerned.
would
that
have
constitutional
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
was
just
going
to
come
to
that.
i
suppose,
at
least
one
of
the
considerations
that
moved
the
congress
to
give
rule-making
power
in
a
sense
to
the
service.
it
was
that
they
wanted
to
have
flexibility
for
the
boundary
near
san
antonio,
texas
or
any
other
densely
populated
area
and
broader
rule
for
this
big
open
space
that
we
have
got
on
this
map.
is
that
reasonable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
if
congress
had
the
power
to
create
some
kind
of
a
sanitare
zone
or
cordon,
they
could
require
everyone
in
that
area,
day
or
night,
24
hours
a
day
to
have
a
pass?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
that
same
objection
about
a
passport
to
leave
or
enter
the
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
would
you
think
could
be
the
barrier
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
in
this
case,
so
we
will
not
directly
involve
so
i
do
not
hold
your
turn.
but
would
you
think
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
problem
there
if
people
are
required
to
carry
and
show
their
pass
that
this
would
be
unreasonable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
cleary.
chief

warren
e.

mr.

you
