justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chanoux,
to
sustain
that
position
of
yours
we
would
have
to
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional,
wouldn’t
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
had
your
client
passed
through
a
customs
here,
mr.
almeida-sanchez?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
statement
of
the
rule
i
thought
had
as
a
part
of
the
rule
that
when
a
man
had
cleared
customs
then
there
would
be
a
certain
limits,
probable
cause
limits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
was
wondering
how
that
rule
would
apply
to
this
particular
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
the
burden
of
proof
then
is
on
the
government
to
show
that
he
had
not
come
through
customs
rather
than
the
burden
of
proof
on
him
to
show
that
he
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
else
would
you
do
with
that
at
the
border
between
mexico
and
united
states
though?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
for
a
illustrative
purposes
i
take
it,
mr.
lacovara.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
a
california
number
that
the
highway
has,
not
a
u.s.
number?
