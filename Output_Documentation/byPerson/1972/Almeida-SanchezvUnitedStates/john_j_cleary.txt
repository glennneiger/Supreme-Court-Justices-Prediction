mr.
john
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
interior
searches.
more
specifically
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
nature
and
extent
of
this
search
permitted
by
immigration
regulation
is
in
conflict
with
the
fourth
amendment,
the
carroll
decision
and
the
litany
of
precedent,
following
that
decision,
basically
can
the
government
authorize
a
regulation
that
permits
a
search
of
an
automobile
on
a
highway
without
a
warrant
and
more
specifically
without
probable
cause.
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
court
under
its
general
mandate,
if
it
could
construe
the
statute
so
as
to
find
the
constitution
would
do
so.
however,
i
think
the
regulation
would
fall.
the
question
is,
what
is
reasonable
distance
and
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
make
it
eminently
clear
what
reasonable
distance
is
to
adjudicate
this
particular
issue.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
you
honor,
it
is
really
faced
with
a
tough
decision
in
that
area
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
reviewing
the
glazu
(ph)
decision
where
it
was
a
peer
search.
judge
browning
in
his
dissent
in
this
case
called
it
a
substantial
equivalent.
i
would,
if
the
court
would
permit,
suggest
a
decision
that
has
a
judicial
import
and
not
a
legislative
one
so
as
to
try
to
quantify.
that
decision
after
reading
the
decisions
in
this
case
and
many
others,
i
would
suggest
would
be
that
distance
necessary
for
the
customs
to
make
the
first
practical
contact
with
the
entrant
after
crossing
the
border.
now,
with
that
definition,
you
can
apply
it
so
as
to
take
care
of
the
situation
where
the
man
flies
from
acapulco
to
chicago
or
the
man
is
in
the
immediate
proximity
of
the
area
and
he
outruns
the
border
inspector,
but
at
the
other
end
of
this
scale
which
i
would
contend
that
this
continuous
surveillance
technique,
and
as
modified
in
the
alexander
case
called
a
substantial
continuous
surveillance
because
you
can
have
some
interruption,
my
suggested
rule
would
be
a
one
shot
rule.
meaning
that
if
the
law
enforcement
officers
allow
the
person
to
pass
through
customs
and
he
clears
it,
then
any
search
thereafter
must
be
based
upon
probable
cause.
if
the
government
having
reliable
informants
and
having
say
corroboration
under
draper
or
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
would
then
contend
that
they
can
arrest
the
person
once
into
the
interior
if
further
information
has
been
corroborated,
would
have
probable
cause
and
would
need
this
subterfuge
of
a
border
search.
so
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
definition
of
border
search
is
possible
to
quantify
it.
i
think
is
next
to
impossible
because
i
could
be
searched
right
now
under
the
existing
regulation
if
i
got
into
an
automobile
and
were
to
drive
to
national
airport
on
the
grounds
that
i
might
be
from
a
country,
say
a
virulent
or
some
other
basis
and
they
were
looking
for
other
irish
people
in
the
vehicle.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
there
were
some
question
there,
your
honor
in
that
one
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
the
first
statement
was
on
being
inquired
and
he
said,
i
picked
up
the
car
in
calexico
which
is
in
the
interior
of
the
united
states
whereas
another
statement
of
the
customs
man
when
he
stopped
and
said,
i
came
from
mexicali,
would
have
meant
he
was
born
in
mexicali
and
of
course
as
his
immigration
card
was
marked,
indicated
that
he
did
have
some
residence
in
mexicali,
but
there
was
no
evidence,
i
would
contend
in
this
record
of
a
border
entry
and
again
the
point
is,
we
have
to
look
ab
initio
at
the
stop
on
the
highway.
that
officer
did
not
know
whether
the
man
had
cleared
the
border
and
they
had
to
stop.
this
was
just
a
random
sampling,
using
his
own
rule
of
thumb
whatever
discretion
whim
caprice
had
in
stopping
an
automobile.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
in
this
case,
since
there
was
no
border
entry
observed,
the
only
way
that
vehicle
could
be
stopped
on
the
highway
consistent
with
the
carroll
decision
is
upon
probable
cause.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
government,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
they
were
seeking
(1)
an
exemption
of
the
warrant
requirement
and
(2)
an
exemption
of
the
probable
cause
requirement,
i
think
that
would
be
eminently
fair.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
that
would
possibly
be
his
contention,
but
the
more
important
issue
is
the
stopping
of
the
vehicle
to
make
this
type
of
search.
what
is
not
before
the
court
right
now
is
an
interstitial
area
known
as
the
founded
suspicion,
a
situation
where
a
vehicle
might
be
briefly
detained
on
is
the
highway
so
that
the
officer
could
make
some
initial
questions
or
check
of
the
man.
that's
not
an
issue
here
and
if
i
could
point
out
two
other
serious
aspects
of
this
case;
the
government
and
its
total
candor
which
is
always
been
the
position,
has
cited
to
you
not
only
the
rule
that
permits
up
to
a
hundred
air
miles
but
287.1
sub
b
points
out
that
the
customs,
i
mean
excuse
me,
the
immigration
director
can
go
beyond
the
100-mile
limit
if
he
so
desires.
so
that
the
100-mile
is
not
a
estop
and
the
second
point
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
sense
of
not
permitting
the
search
though
of
this
random
search
as
they
would
now
interpret
it.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
can
have
point
out
another
serious
constitutional
defect
in
a
regulation,
is
that
this
court
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire
struck
down
an
attorney
general
acting
with
its
another
hat
as
justice
of
the
peace
issuing
out
his
own
search
warrant.
does
it
not
seem
anomalous
to
this
court
that
here
we
have
the
attorney
general
defining
what
is
reasonable
distance
or
what
is
the
exempted
area
of
the
fourth
amendment?
and
so
for
the
executive
to
take
that
type
of
role
in
cutting
down
a
fourth
amendment
application
and
as
i
point
out
to
the
court,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
have
first
of
all,
an
exception
in
it
for
the
border,
but
this
court
in
the
carroll
case
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
will
be
interpreted
at
the
time
of
its
adaption
and
certainly
border
searches
are
proper.
but
if
i
were
council
for
the
establishment
in
1776
in
this
country
and
were
thinking
of
ways
in
which
to
draft
legislation
or
rules
authorizing
a
writ
of
assistance,
i
couldn't
do
a
better
job
than
what
we
have
right
here
in
this
regulation.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
the
authority
of
the
executive
to
so
limit,
define,
contract
the
fourth
amendment.
it
applies
throughout
the
united
states
and
i
think
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
to
uphold
it.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
it
applies
to,
it
can
search
any
vehicle,
meaning
it
could
be
anyone's
vehicle.
your
honor's
vehicle
could
be
down
the
highway
and
technically
under
this
regulation,
you
could
be
stopped
and
not
only
are
you
questioned,
but
your
vehicle
is
searched
and
the
trunk
opened
up
and
in
the
case
we
have
in
point
to
show
you
how
far
they
are
gone
under
the
seat
and
there
is
even
ninth
circuit
cases
where
they
looked
in
paper
bags
for
aliens
and
the
court
held
that,
of
course,
that
was
not
a
proper
place
to
look
for
aliens
or
in
(inaudible)
crevices
and
in
other
places,
but
it
shows
the
potential
for
abuse
in
such
searches.
i
would
further
point
out
and
i
would
like
to
cite
to
the
court
an
additional
authority
in
ninth
circuit
opinion
written
by
judge
hufstedler,
it's
u.s.
versus
mallides,
it's
slip
opinion
only,
72-1898
and
it
was
decided
on
the
22nd
of
january
and
there,
six
of
mexican
appearing
individuals
driving
down
a
highway
in
a
chrysler
automobile
steered
straight
ahead
as
a
patrol
car
passed
them.
they
were
stopped
and
they
were
interrogated
and
the
court
there
reviewed
that
this
was
of
course
an
improper
stop.
the
reason
i
raise
this
is
that
such
a
regulation
or
its
implementation
can
be
clearly
discriminatory
in
its
application,
that
is
to
say
even
the
government’s
brief
at
page
24,
in
the
footnote
in
the
last
line
points
out
the
these
stops
on
a
random
sampling
are
made
on
apparent
nationalities.
well,
i
do
not
know
how
one
can
physically
observe
one’s
nationality
other
than
to
use
certain
racial
or
color
characteristics
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
you
honor,
at
the
border
in
mexico
and
united
states,
there
are
a
great
deal
of
mexican
american
people.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
here
legally.
i
think
that
the
stop
for
aliens
and
that
is
the
reasonable
alternative
in
this
case
is
to
apply
the
protective
and
preventative
measures
at
the
border.
if
you
look
at
our
border,
there
are
just
holes
in
the
fence
all
the
way
along.
the
government
contends
there
is
2,000
miles
of
border,
there
is
4,000
on
canada
and
they
got
1,400
out
of
their
1,700
border
patrol
officers
down
on
the
mexican
border.
the
question
is
and
i
think
appropriately
is
they
are
stopped
at
the
border
and
if
we
don't
have
so
to
speak
a
preventative
policing
of
the
border,
then
we
should
not
allow
the
highest
pragmatism
with
the
government
to
lay
back
and
claim
inherent
exceptions
to
the
fourth
amendment
to
stop
all
vehicles.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
have
made
suggestion,
your
honor
to
our
u.s.
attorney.
in
fact,
one
of
the
suggestions
i
made
was
that,
we
are
having
now
many
of
our
armed
forces
returning
from
vietnam
and
one
of
suggestions
i
had
is
that
properly
the
armed
and
brought
into
an
auxiliary
capacity,
could
be
an
excellent
device
to
act
as
a
constabulary,
something
every
other
country
in
the
world
has
but
our
own.
in
any
event,
i
do
not
see
the
advantages
of
placing
this.
now,
the
essential
question
is,
why
should
we
even
have
a
border
patrol
at
all.
i
mean
that
is
a
very
serious
moral
question
and
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
am
only
in
a
legal
framework
now,
but
if
you
are
asking
for
ways
in
which
to
supply
that
manpower,
i
would
suggest,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
might
not
be
philosophically
in
line
with
that
type
of
policing,
i
would
say
that,
that
resource
would
be
available.
i
further
would
point
out
that
one
of
the
other
problems
with
these
type
of
searches
is,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
minor
intrusion,
we're
not
dealing
with
the
licensing
requirement.
we're
dealing
with
a
serious
look
for
evidence,
evidence
of
a
crime.
the
government
has
cited
the
see,
camara,
colonnade
and
biswell
decisions.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
those
are
readily
distinguishable.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
january
22nd,
your
honor.
it
is
m-a-l-l-i-d-e-s.
and
if
the
court
would
like
an
analysis
of
border
searches
in
a
recent
opinion
by
judge
dunaway,
i
would
cite
u.s.
versus
petersen,
that's
72-2123
and
that
was
decided
18th
of
january
and
is
also
in
a
slip
opinion.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
in
this
case,
there
was
not
a
momentary
detention
and
the
possibility
for
a
subterfuge
or
something
other
than
just
an
alien
check
as
in
this
case
is
just
paramount.
i
would
point
out
that
in
dealing
with
the
camara
and
see
cases,
we
had
situations
where
a
warrant
was
required.
it
was
held
not
only
was
man’s
residence
protected
to
a
certain
degree
even
though
the
probable
cause
requirement
could
be
dropped
but
also
a
business.
in
the
colonnade,
biswell
cases,
i
would
tender
to
the
court
four
basic
distinctions.
first,
the
group
involved
in
that
area
is
a
self-defined
target
group,
that
is
to
say,
men
who
have
chosen
their
particular
occupation,
firearms
or
the
liquor
business.
two,
that
in
this
business
venture,
there
is
not
a
justifiable
expectation
of
privacy
one
would
expect
in
an
automobile.
and
when
the
statute
and
regulation
here
says
vehicle
that
would
include
also
van,
it
would
include
camper
which
is
kind
of
like
a
quasi
home
and
a
mobile
home
which
might
be
a
person’s
only
home
on
the
highway.
second
of
all,
i
would
indicate
that
the
searches
in
colonnade
and
biswell
were
of
business
establishment
during
day
light
hours.
this
case,
it
was
in
shortly
after
midnight,
stopped
on
a
highway.
it's
a
very
personal
in
nature
when
you
start
to
go
through
a
man’s
vehicle
which
this
court
with
justice
jackson
in
brinegar
has
defined
as
one
of
the
effects,
the
automobile
itself
that
he
was
driving
on
a
highway.
i
would
dare
say
that
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
to
the
rule
that
is
proposed
here.
the
first
one
is,
greater
registration
requirements.
there
is
now
a
requirement
that
aliens
register
in
january.
i
would
suggest
that
one
on
employers;
if
registration
was
required
by
employers,
it
would
be
a
great
way
to
alleviate
the
burden
of
the
illegal
aliens
in
this
country.
sometime,
we
do
not
consider
the
cause
and
effect.
why
are
these
aliens
here?
and
a
little
application
of
common
sense
logic
would
indicate
that
we
had
some
type
of
registration
or
kind
of
control
in
that
area,
we
might
alleviate
some
of
the
problems.
second
one,
on
welfare
and
third;
i
would
suggest
even
license
in
activities.
one
of
the
best
detectives
for
aliens
in
our
area,
happens
to
be
the
california
department
of
motor
vehicles
because
people
come
in
and
do
not
have
this
evidence
and
they
determine
that
they
are
here
illegally.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor
and
i
am
not
trying
to
indicate
that.
i
am
saying
that
given
the
balancing
of
the
interest
here
that
at
the
border
when
operation
intercept
was
in
operation
and
custom
backed
up
things
along
ways.
i
might
add
to
the
court
that
they
have
been
substantially
improved
at
the
tijuana
border.
they
have
a
very
expeditious
way
of
processing.
however,
i
think
the
answer
lies
in
applying
the
border
search
at
the
border.
and
further,
on
the
doctrine
of
pragmatism,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
its
own
opinion
in
united
states
where
u.s.
district
court,
in
that
case,
this
court
where
the
government
contended
a
very
strong
issue,
national
security,
this
court
not
only
of
course
required
the
probable
cause
for
wire
tapping
but
even
went
further
and
said,
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
use
that
pragmatic
approach
to
excuse
even
the
warrant
requirement.
and
all
we're
asking
for
here
is
once
a
vehicle
is
in
the
interior,
it's
on
the
highways,
should
not
the
government
be
required
to
have
at
least
probable
cause.
some
of
the
other
reasons
why
this
court
should
be
concerned
with
this
particular
rule,
because
of
the
dichotomy
that
exists
as
between
contraband
and
aliens.
on
one
hand,
the
introduction
of
this
noxious
controlled
substance,
be
it
marijuana,
heroine
or
any
of
the
other
narcotics
is
a
national
interest,
a
super
concern
in
fact
in
my
humble
opinion
far
more
important
than
the
question
of
a
man
from
another
country
seeking
a
better
way
of
life
in
our
country.
and
that
under
the
application
of
the
law
as
it
now
stands,
there
must
be
probable
cause
once
the
vehicle
clears
the
border
area
or
the
immediate
border
area
and
that
judge
browning
in
his
dissent
points
out
the
strange
dichotomy
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
statute
used
here
is
not
as
liberal
as
the
customs
statutes
which
are
19-482
and
19-1581.
they
are
far
more
liberal,
yet
the
circuit
and
other
circuits
have
held
to
allow
those
statute
to
operate
without
probable
cause
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
for
aliens,
we
make
an
exception.
i
feel
that,
that
is
not
a
fair
balancing
of
the
issue.
second,
i
would
point
out
that
we
can
sometimes
in
our
federal
system
learn
from
the
states.
chief
justice
roger
traynor,
california
supreme
court,
a
well-known
national
jurist,
familiar
with
criminal
law
wrote
well
on
this
decision
when
dealing
with
sheriffs
to
try
to
justify
a
border
search
for
a
vehicle.
in
fact,
they
might
have
had
something
that
might
have
almost
amounted
to
founded
suspicion
when
a
man
had
a
dented
fender
and
in
people
versus
giles,
cited
to
you
in
the
government’s
brief,
the
court
held
that
such
a
search
would
be
intolerable
and
took
the
carroll
decision
of
this
court
to
find
why
state
officers
couldn't
do
it.
so
on
one
hand,
we
have
state
officers
who
can't
conduct
such
searches,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
federal
law
officers
with
this
unlimited
power.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
sir.
that
is
correct.
i
only
contend
that
a
border
search
requires
a
border
entry.
and
in
this
case,
a
border
entry
was
not
established
and
also
the
type
of
search
conducted
here
on
the
highways
would
apply
anywhere
in
the
united
states
when
they
almost
covered
the
majority
of
the
existing
population
in
the
united
states.
and
although
the
government
does
point
out
that
it
would
not
exercise
that
power
to
conduct
searches,
say
in
times
square
in
new
york
city,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
rely
upon
the
goodwill
of
the
executive.
it
is
an
absolute
bar
in
that
if
there
was
some
type
of
nexus
shown
with
the
border
prior
to
the
stop,
a
different
situation
might
exist.
and
i
might
also
point
out
to
the
court,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
founded
suspicion
situation,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
terry
versus
ohio
situation
or
adams
versus
william
situation
where
there
was
a
stop
and
a
protect
of,
first
for
the
officer
involved
which
is
certainly
an
anomaly
reasonable
type
of
situation.
with
the
court
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
it
would
have
constitutional
problems,
however,
it'd
be
in
a
much
better
posture
than
what
we
have
here,
specifically
i
think
what
your
honor
might
be
touching
upon
which
has
troubled
me
greatly
about
this
particular
case,
is
unlike
colonnade
and
biswell
where
there
was
detailed
statutory
scheme
set
up
where
congress
outlined
the
procedure
here.
the
statutes
has
reasonable
distance
and
in
the
executive
through
the
ins
takes
over
with
regulations
and
they
set
up
the
sanitized
zone,
i
would
say
serious.
now
there
might
be
a
court
case
where
congress
could
create
this
sanitized
area
with
certain
limitations
as
to
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
that
would
be
conducted
limiting
also
the
operation
of
these
various
checkpoints.
the
ironic
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
checkpoints
are
little
borders
so
to
speak.
if
you
are
stopped
on
interstate
5
going
towards
l.a.,
at
the
border
what
we
call
as
the
first
stop
is
just
initial
check
and
if
you
look
funny,
you
are
suspicious
or
anything
out
of
the
ordinary,
you
are
kicked
over
to
what
they
call
secondary
and
there
they
could
literally
take
your
car
apart
and
you
have
little
to
say
at
the
border.
the
question,
the
ironic
thing
is
when
you
are
stopped
at
the
checkpoints,
the
ins
uses
the
same
term
over
the
secondary
with
the
same
limitation.
they
have
created
the
second
border
exception.
now,
my
only
reaction
is
that,
it
kind
of
strikes
at
what
the
fourth
amendment
has
designed
to
do
for
the
executive
do
that,
but
i
think
the
congress
as
a
lawmaker
could
sit
down
and
work
out
certain
things.
i
think
also
metropolitan
areas
would
be
in
a
different
posture.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
think
that's
a
possibly
giving
the
counsel
too
much
credit
because
the
analysis,
the
legislative
history
is
very
sparse
on
this
particular
statute
and
further,
i
think
this
was
a
response
to
an
exhortation
of
the
government
to
include
this
amendment
about
reasonable
distance
and
i
feel
that
the
matter
was
not
properly
dealt
with
by
congress
in
present
posture
of
this
case
and
that
given
the
areas
though,
even
open
or
desolate
areas
as
they
might
be
called,
the
person
in
those
areas
is
no
less
of
a
person
under
our
system
of
government
than
say,
someone
else
so
that
the
camper
in
that
area
who
is
a
transient
or
the
resident
in
that
area,
really
because
he
is
so
fortuitously
located
near
the
border,
so
not
subject
him
to
some
type
of
police
surveillance
to
which,
it's
our
contention
of
fourth
amendment
would
prohibit.
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
i
would
also
suggest
that
like
the
carroll
decision
where
they
were
looking
for
alcohol
and
not
an
administrative
regulation
just
eliminating
alcohol,
here
they're
looking
for
aliens
and
the
alien
himself,
one
alien,
no
matter
how
big
or
how
small
is
in
violation
of
the
statute,
is
present
in
the
country,
in
violation
of
1325
as
counsel
has
pointed
out.
the
person
carrying
him
is
in
violation
of
1324,
a
felony
dealing
with
either
transporting
or
the
bringing
in
unlawfully
of
aliens
and
further,
that
a
man
who
comes
back
the
second
time
after
having
been
deported
is
not
just
a
person
we're
going
to
slap
on
the
wrist
but
who
is
subject
to
a
felony
prosecution
under
8
u.s.c.
1326.
this
is
criminal
business.
further,
the
other
difficulty
is
in
this
particular
matter
is
the
scope
with
the
search.
now,
counsel
has
said
that
there
are
few
cases
litigated
about
how
far
the
immigration
service
go.
i
think
there
is
quite
a
few
and
not
only
that,
but
at
the
district
court
level,
we
had
a
case
where
the
agent
with
his
unique
olfactory
senses
discovered
what
he
thought
was
marijuana
by
sniffing
hard
in
the
vehicle.
he
sniffed
so
hard
that
he
opened
up
the
suitcase
and
there
it
was,
narcotics.
he
went
to
court.
the
only
trouble
was
when
the
motion
to
suppress
was
granted,
it
was
cocaine
in
the
suitcase
rather
than
marijuana.
another
situation
turned
up
on
how
far
they
go
in
locating
aliens.
there
were
two
suitcases
together.
neither
one
of
which
would
hold
an
alien
and
they
searched
both
trunks
and
the
court
said,
well
that
is
not
a
very
good
thing,
they
had
it
go
all
the
way
to
the
ninth
circuit,
you
should
have
pushed
the
cases
apart
before
you
started
to
look
for
an
alien
because
it
although
was
physical
possible.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
gymnastics
that
go
on
to
allow
legitimate
law
enforcement
inquiry.
but
i
think
in
this
area,
if
there
is
a
reasonable
bar
as
to
contraband,
a
far
more
serious,
a
more
harmful
thing
to
our
national
interest.
then
that
bar
should
stand
also
as
to
aliens.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
your
honor,
i
cannot
speak
as
to
the
law
but
speaking
as
american
citizen,
i
think
that
smacks
of
something
that
just
so
grows
with
our
way
of
life
that
i
can
never
understand
congress
doing
something.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
sir,
i
do
not.
but
that
is
at
the
border
and
that
is
if
i
leave
this
country
but
here
in
this
country,
if
i
carried
something
like
that,
i
would
have
to
start
checking
out
my
arm
for
some
type
of
tattoo.
it
smacks
of
a
form
of
government
and
so
(inaudible)
that
i
doubt
if
there
were
something
like
that
dealt
by
congress.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
am
at
a
lost
to
a
respond
to,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
could
not
say
it
is
just
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
so.
i
think
also
a
fifth
amendment
going
back
to
shapiro
versus
thompson
and
all
the
other
ones
on
the
freedom
of
movement
concept.
there
is
clearly
law
and
i
fully
agree
with
the
right
of
aliens,
carrying
identification
cards,
the
i-151,
that
is
i
think
is
legitimate,
clearly
legitimate.
but
for
american
citizen
to
carry
identification
in
that
type
of
area,
it
might
be
also
be
an
equal
protection
argument
that
a
person
is
inside
and
not
on
the
sanitized
zone.
why
would
he
not
have
to
carry
such
an
application.
it's
fraught
with
problems
of
course.
it's
not
here
before
you
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
there
is
much
ingenuity
that
could
be
worked
out
by
congress
that
was
not
handled
in
this
particular
case
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
troublesome
aspects.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
thank
you
so
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
interior
searches.
more
specifically
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
nature
and
extent
of
this
search
permitted
by
immigration
regulation
is
in
conflict
with
the
fourth
amendment,
the
carroll
decision
and
the
litany
of
precedent,
following
that
decision,
basically
can
the
government
authorize
a
regulation
that
permits
a
search
of
an
automobile
on
a
highway
without
a
warrant
and
more
specifically
without
probable
cause.
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
court
under
its
general
mandate,
if
it
could
construe
the
statute
so
as
to
find
the
constitution
would
do
so.
however,
i
think
the
regulation
would
fall.
the
question
is,
what
is
reasonable
distance
and
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
make
it
eminently
clear
what
reasonable
distance
is
to
adjudicate
this
particular
issue.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
you
honor,
it
is
really
faced
with
a
tough
decision
in
that
area
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
reviewing
the
glazu
(ph)
decision
where
it
was
a
peer
search.
judge
browning
in
his
dissent
in
this
case
called
it
a
substantial
equivalent.
i
would,
if
the
court
would
permit,
suggest
a
decision
that
has
a
judicial
import
and
not
a
legislative
one
so
as
to
try
to
quantify.
that
decision
after
reading
the
decisions
in
this
case
and
many
others,
i
would
suggest
would
be
that
distance
necessary
for
the
customs
to
make
the
first
practical
contact
with
the
entrant
after
crossing
the
border.
now,
with
that
definition,
you
can
apply
it
so
as
to
take
care
of
the
situation
where
the
man
flies
from
acapulco
to
chicago
or
the
man
is
in
the
immediate
proximity
of
the
area
and
he
outruns
the
border
inspector,
but
at
the
other
end
of
this
scale
which
i
would
contend
that
this
continuous
surveillance
technique,
and
as
modified
in
the
alexander
case
called
a
substantial
continuous
surveillance
because
you
can
have
some
interruption,
my
suggested
rule
would
be
a
one
shot
rule.
meaning
that
if
the
law
enforcement
officers
allow
the
person
to
pass
through
customs
and
he
clears
it,
then
any
search
thereafter
must
be
based
upon
probable
cause.
if
the
government
having
reliable
informants
and
having
say
corroboration
under
draper
or
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
would
then
contend
that
they
can
arrest
the
person
once
into
the
interior
if
further
information
has
been
corroborated,
would
have
probable
cause
and
would
need
this
subterfuge
of
a
border
search.
so
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
definition
of
border
search
is
possible
to
quantify
it.
i
think
is
next
to
impossible
because
i
could
be
searched
right
now
under
the
existing
regulation
if
i
got
into
an
automobile
and
were
to
drive
to
national
airport
on
the
grounds
that
i
might
be
from
a
country,
say
a
virulent
or
some
other
basis
and
they
were
looking
for
other
irish
people
in
the
vehicle.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
there
were
some
question
there,
your
honor
in
that
one
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
the
first
statement
was
on
being
inquired
and
he
said,
i
picked
up
the
car
in
calexico
which
is
in
the
interior
of
the
united
states
whereas
another
statement
of
the
customs
man
when
he
stopped
and
said,
i
came
from
mexicali,
would
have
meant
he
was
born
in
mexicali
and
of
course
as
his
immigration
card
was
marked,
indicated
that
he
did
have
some
residence
in
mexicali,
but
there
was
no
evidence,
i
would
contend
in
this
record
of
a
border
entry
and
again
the
point
is,
we
have
to
look
ab
initio
at
the
stop
on
the
highway.
that
officer
did
not
know
whether
the
man
had
cleared
the
border
and
they
had
to
stop.
this
was
just
a
random
sampling,
using
his
own
rule
of
thumb
whatever
discretion
whim
caprice
had
in
stopping
an
automobile.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
in
this
case,
since
there
was
no
border
entry
observed,
the
only
way
that
vehicle
could
be
stopped
on
the
highway
consistent
with
the
carroll
decision
is
upon
probable
cause.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
government,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
they
were
seeking
(1)
an
exemption
of
the
warrant
requirement
and
(2)
an
exemption
of
the
probable
cause
requirement,
i
think
that
would
be
eminently
fair.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
that
would
possibly
be
his
contention,
but
the
more
important
issue
is
the
stopping
of
the
vehicle
to
make
this
type
of
search.
what
is
not
before
the
court
right
now
is
an
interstitial
area
known
as
the
founded
suspicion,
a
situation
where
a
vehicle
might
be
briefly
detained
on
is
the
highway
so
that
the
officer
could
make
some
initial
questions
or
check
of
the
man.
that's
not
an
issue
here
and
if
i
could
point
out
two
other
serious
aspects
of
this
case;
the
government
and
its
total
candor
which
is
always
been
the
position,
has
cited
to
you
not
only
the
rule
that
permits
up
to
a
hundred
air
miles
but
287.1
sub
b
points
out
that
the
customs,
i
mean
excuse
me,
the
immigration
director
can
go
beyond
the
100-mile
limit
if
he
so
desires.
so
that
the
100-mile
is
not
a
estop
and
the
second
point
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
sense
of
not
permitting
the
search
though
of
this
random
search
as
they
would
now
interpret
it.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
can
have
point
out
another
serious
constitutional
defect
in
a
regulation,
is
that
this
court
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire
struck
down
an
attorney
general
acting
with
its
another
hat
as
justice
of
the
peace
issuing
out
his
own
search
warrant.
does
it
not
seem
anomalous
to
this
court
that
here
we
have
the
attorney
general
defining
what
is
reasonable
distance
or
what
is
the
exempted
area
of
the
fourth
amendment?
and
so
for
the
executive
to
take
that
type
of
role
in
cutting
down
a
fourth
amendment
application
and
as
i
point
out
to
the
court,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
have
first
of
all,
an
exception
in
it
for
the
border,
but
this
court
in
the
carroll
case
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
will
be
interpreted
at
the
time
of
its
adaption
and
certainly
border
searches
are
proper.
but
if
i
were
council
for
the
establishment
in
1776
in
this
country
and
were
thinking
of
ways
in
which
to
draft
legislation
or
rules
authorizing
a
writ
of
assistance,
i
couldn't
do
a
better
job
than
what
we
have
right
here
in
this
regulation.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
the
authority
of
the
executive
to
so
limit,
define,
contract
the
fourth
amendment.
it
applies
throughout
the
united
states
and
i
think
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
to
uphold
it.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
it
applies
to,
it
can
search
any
vehicle,
meaning
it
could
be
anyone's
vehicle.
your
honor's
vehicle
could
be
down
the
highway
and
technically
under
this
regulation,
you
could
be
stopped
and
not
only
are
you
questioned,
but
your
vehicle
is
searched
and
the
trunk
opened
up
and
in
the
case
we
have
in
point
to
show
you
how
far
they
are
gone
under
the
seat
and
there
is
even
ninth
circuit
cases
where
they
looked
in
paper
bags
for
aliens
and
the
court
held
that,
of
course,
that
was
not
a
proper
place
to
look
for
aliens
or
in
(inaudible)
crevices
and
in
other
places,
but
it
shows
the
potential
for
abuse
in
such
searches.
i
would
further
point
out
and
i
would
like
to
cite
to
the
court
an
additional
authority
in
ninth
circuit
opinion
written
by
judge
hufstedler,
it's
u.s.
versus
mallides,
it's
slip
opinion
only,
72-1898
and
it
was
decided
on
the
22nd
of
january
and
there,
six
of
mexican
appearing
individuals
driving
down
a
highway
in
a
chrysler
automobile
steered
straight
ahead
as
a
patrol
car
passed
them.
they
were
stopped
and
they
were
interrogated
and
the
court
there
reviewed
that
this
was
of
course
an
improper
stop.
the
reason
i
raise
this
is
that
such
a
regulation
or
its
implementation
can
be
clearly
discriminatory
in
its
application,
that
is
to
say
even
the
government’s
brief
at
page
24,
in
the
footnote
in
the
last
line
points
out
the
these
stops
on
a
random
sampling
are
made
on
apparent
nationalities.
well,
i
do
not
know
how
one
can
physically
observe
one’s
nationality
other
than
to
use
certain
racial
or
color
characteristics
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
you
honor,
at
the
border
in
mexico
and
united
states,
there
are
a
great
deal
of
mexican
american
people.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
here
legally.
i
think
that
the
stop
for
aliens
and
that
is
the
reasonable
alternative
in
this
case
is
to
apply
the
protective
and
preventative
measures
at
the
border.
if
you
look
at
our
border,
there
are
just
holes
in
the
fence
all
the
way
along.
the
government
contends
there
is
2,000
miles
of
border,
there
is
4,000
on
canada
and
they
got
1,400
out
of
their
1,700
border
patrol
officers
down
on
the
mexican
border.
the
question
is
and
i
think
appropriately
is
they
are
stopped
at
the
border
and
if
we
don't
have
so
to
speak
a
preventative
policing
of
the
border,
then
we
should
not
allow
the
highest
pragmatism
with
the
government
to
lay
back
and
claim
inherent
exceptions
to
the
fourth
amendment
to
stop
all
vehicles.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
have
made
suggestion,
your
honor
to
our
u.s.
attorney.
in
fact,
one
of
the
suggestions
i
made
was
that,
we
are
having
now
many
of
our
armed
forces
returning
from
vietnam
and
one
of
suggestions
i
had
is
that
properly
the
armed
and
brought
into
an
auxiliary
capacity,
could
be
an
excellent
device
to
act
as
a
constabulary,
something
every
other
country
in
the
world
has
but
our
own.
in
any
event,
i
do
not
see
the
advantages
of
placing
this.
now,
the
essential
question
is,
why
should
we
even
have
a
border
patrol
at
all.
i
mean
that
is
a
very
serious
moral
question
and
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
am
only
in
a
legal
framework
now,
but
if
you
are
asking
for
ways
in
which
to
supply
that
manpower,
i
would
suggest,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
might
not
be
philosophically
in
line
with
that
type
of
policing,
i
would
say
that,
that
resource
would
be
available.
i
further
would
point
out
that
one
of
the
other
problems
with
these
type
of
searches
is,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
minor
intrusion,
we're
not
dealing
with
the
licensing
requirement.
we're
dealing
with
a
serious
look
for
evidence,
evidence
of
a
crime.
the
government
has
cited
the
see,
camara,
colonnade
and
biswell
decisions.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
those
are
readily
distinguishable.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
january
22nd,
your
honor.
it
is
m-a-l-l-i-d-e-s.
and
if
the
court
would
like
an
analysis
of
border
searches
in
a
recent
opinion
by
judge
dunaway,
i
would
cite
u.s.
versus
petersen,
that's
72-2123
and
that
was
decided
18th
of
january
and
is
also
in
a
slip
opinion.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
in
this
case,
there
was
not
a
momentary
detention
and
the
possibility
for
a
subterfuge
or
something
other
than
just
an
alien
check
as
in
this
case
is
just
paramount.
i
would
point
out
that
in
dealing
with
the
camara
and
see
cases,
we
had
situations
where
a
warrant
was
required.
it
was
held
not
only
was
man’s
residence
protected
to
a
certain
degree
even
though
the
probable
cause
requirement
could
be
dropped
but
also
a
business.
in
the
colonnade,
biswell
cases,
i
would
tender
to
the
court
four
basic
distinctions.
first,
the
group
involved
in
that
area
is
a
self-defined
target
group,
that
is
to
say,
men
who
have
chosen
their
particular
occupation,
firearms
or
the
liquor
business.
two,
that
in
this
business
venture,
there
is
not
a
justifiable
expectation
of
privacy
one
would
expect
in
an
automobile.
and
when
the
statute
and
regulation
here
says
vehicle
that
would
include
also
van,
it
would
include
camper
which
is
kind
of
like
a
quasi
home
and
a
mobile
home
which
might
be
a
person’s
only
home
on
the
highway.
second
of
all,
i
would
indicate
that
the
searches
in
colonnade
and
biswell
were
of
business
establishment
during
day
light
hours.
this
case,
it
was
in
shortly
after
midnight,
stopped
on
a
highway.
it's
a
very
personal
in
nature
when
you
start
to
go
through
a
man’s
vehicle
which
this
court
with
justice
jackson
in
brinegar
has
defined
as
one
of
the
effects,
the
automobile
itself
that
he
was
driving
on
a
highway.
i
would
dare
say
that
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
to
the
rule
that
is
proposed
here.
the
first
one
is,
greater
registration
requirements.
there
is
now
a
requirement
that
aliens
register
in
january.
i
would
suggest
that
one
on
employers;
if
registration
was
required
by
employers,
it
would
be
a
great
way
to
alleviate
the
burden
of
the
illegal
aliens
in
this
country.
sometime,
we
do
not
consider
the
cause
and
effect.
why
are
these
aliens
here?
and
a
little
application
of
common
sense
logic
would
indicate
that
we
had
some
type
of
registration
or
kind
of
control
in
that
area,
we
might
alleviate
some
of
the
problems.
second
one,
on
welfare
and
third;
i
would
suggest
even
license
in
activities.
one
of
the
best
detectives
for
aliens
in
our
area,
happens
to
be
the
california
department
of
motor
vehicles
because
people
come
in
and
do
not
have
this
evidence
and
they
determine
that
they
are
here
illegally.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor
and
i
am
not
trying
to
indicate
that.
i
am
saying
that
given
the
balancing
of
the
interest
here
that
at
the
border
when
operation
intercept
was
in
operation
and
custom
backed
up
things
along
ways.
i
might
add
to
the
court
that
they
have
been
substantially
improved
at
the
tijuana
border.
they
have
a
very
expeditious
way
of
processing.
however,
i
think
the
answer
lies
in
applying
the
border
search
at
the
border.
and
further,
on
the
doctrine
of
pragmatism,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
its
own
opinion
in
united
states
where
u.s.
district
court,
in
that
case,
this
court
where
the
government
contended
a
very
strong
issue,
national
security,
this
court
not
only
of
course
required
the
probable
cause
for
wire
tapping
but
even
went
further
and
said,
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
use
that
pragmatic
approach
to
excuse
even
the
warrant
requirement.
and
all
we're
asking
for
here
is
once
a
vehicle
is
in
the
interior,
it's
on
the
highways,
should
not
the
government
be
required
to
have
at
least
probable
cause.
some
of
the
other
reasons
why
this
court
should
be
concerned
with
this
particular
rule,
because
of
the
dichotomy
that
exists
as
between
contraband
and
aliens.
on
one
hand,
the
introduction
of
this
noxious
controlled
substance,
be
it
marijuana,
heroine
or
any
of
the
other
narcotics
is
a
national
interest,
a
super
concern
in
fact
in
my
humble
opinion
far
more
important
than
the
question
of
a
man
from
another
country
seeking
a
better
way
of
life
in
our
country.
and
that
under
the
application
of
the
law
as
it
now
stands,
there
must
be
probable
cause
once
the
vehicle
clears
the
border
area
or
the
immediate
border
area
and
that
judge
browning
in
his
dissent
points
out
the
strange
dichotomy
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
statute
used
here
is
not
as
liberal
as
the
customs
statutes
which
are
19-482
and
19-1581.
they
are
far
more
liberal,
yet
the
circuit
and
other
circuits
have
held
to
allow
those
statute
to
operate
without
probable
cause
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
for
aliens,
we
make
an
exception.
i
feel
that,
that
is
not
a
fair
balancing
of
the
issue.
second,
i
would
point
out
that
we
can
sometimes
in
our
federal
system
learn
from
the
states.
chief
justice
roger
traynor,
california
supreme
court,
a
well-known
national
jurist,
familiar
with
criminal
law
wrote
well
on
this
decision
when
dealing
with
sheriffs
to
try
to
justify
a
border
search
for
a
vehicle.
in
fact,
they
might
have
had
something
that
might
have
almost
amounted
to
founded
suspicion
when
a
man
had
a
dented
fender
and
in
people
versus
giles,
cited
to
you
in
the
government’s
brief,
the
court
held
that
such
a
search
would
be
intolerable
and
took
the
carroll
decision
of
this
court
to
find
why
state
officers
couldn't
do
it.
so
on
one
hand,
we
have
state
officers
who
can't
conduct
such
searches,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
federal
law
officers
with
this
unlimited
power.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
sir.
that
is
correct.
i
only
contend
that
a
border
search
requires
a
border
entry.
and
in
this
case,
a
border
entry
was
not
established
and
also
the
type
of
search
conducted
here
on
the
highways
would
apply
anywhere
in
the
united
states
when
they
almost
covered
the
majority
of
the
existing
population
in
the
united
states.
and
although
the
government
does
point
out
that
it
would
not
exercise
that
power
to
conduct
searches,
say
in
times
square
in
new
york
city,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
rely
upon
the
goodwill
of
the
executive.
it
is
an
absolute
bar
in
that
if
there
was
some
type
of
nexus
shown
with
the
border
prior
to
the
stop,
a
different
situation
might
exist.
and
i
might
also
point
out
to
the
court,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
founded
suspicion
situation,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
terry
versus
ohio
situation
or
adams
versus
william
situation
where
there
was
a
stop
and
a
protect
of,
first
for
the
officer
involved
which
is
certainly
an
anomaly
reasonable
type
of
situation.
with
the
court
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
it
would
have
constitutional
problems,
however,
it'd
be
in
a
much
better
posture
than
what
we
have
here,
specifically
i
think
what
your
honor
might
be
touching
upon
which
has
troubled
me
greatly
about
this
particular
case,
is
unlike
colonnade
and
biswell
where
there
was
detailed
statutory
scheme
set
up
where
congress
outlined
the
procedure
here.
the
statutes
has
reasonable
distance
and
in
the
executive
through
the
ins
takes
over
with
regulations
and
they
set
up
the
sanitized
zone,
i
would
say
serious.
now
there
might
be
a
court
case
where
congress
could
create
this
sanitized
area
with
certain
limitations
as
to
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
that
would
be
conducted
limiting
also
the
operation
of
these
various
checkpoints.
the
ironic
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
checkpoints
are
little
borders
so
to
speak.
if
you
are
stopped
on
interstate
5
going
towards
l.a.,
at
the
border
what
we
call
as
the
first
stop
is
just
initial
check
and
if
you
look
funny,
you
are
suspicious
or
anything
out
of
the
ordinary,
you
are
kicked
over
to
what
they
call
secondary
and
there
they
could
literally
take
your
car
apart
and
you
have
little
to
say
at
the
border.
the
question,
the
ironic
thing
is
when
you
are
stopped
at
the
checkpoints,
the
ins
uses
the
same
term
over
the
secondary
with
the
same
limitation.
they
have
created
the
second
border
exception.
now,
my
only
reaction
is
that,
it
kind
of
strikes
at
what
the
fourth
amendment
has
designed
to
do
for
the
executive
do
that,
but
i
think
the
congress
as
a
lawmaker
could
sit
down
and
work
out
certain
things.
i
think
also
metropolitan
areas
would
be
in
a
different
posture.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
think
that's
a
possibly
giving
the
counsel
too
much
credit
because
the
analysis,
the
legislative
history
is
very
sparse
on
this
particular
statute
and
further,
i
think
this
was
a
response
to
an
exhortation
of
the
government
to
include
this
amendment
about
reasonable
distance
and
i
feel
that
the
matter
was
not
properly
dealt
with
by
congress
in
present
posture
of
this
case
and
that
given
the
areas
though,
even
open
or
desolate
areas
as
they
might
be
called,
the
person
in
those
areas
is
no
less
of
a
person
under
our
system
of
government
than
say,
someone
else
so
that
the
camper
in
that
area
who
is
a
transient
or
the
resident
in
that
area,
really
because
he
is
so
fortuitously
located
near
the
border,
so
not
subject
him
to
some
type
of
police
surveillance
to
which,
it's
our
contention
of
fourth
amendment
would
prohibit.
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
i
would
also
suggest
that
like
the
carroll
decision
where
they
were
looking
for
alcohol
and
not
an
administrative
regulation
just
eliminating
alcohol,
here
they're
looking
for
aliens
and
the
alien
himself,
one
alien,
no
matter
how
big
or
how
small
is
in
violation
of
the
statute,
is
present
in
the
country,
in
violation
of
1325
as
counsel
has
pointed
out.
the
person
carrying
him
is
in
violation
of
1324,
a
felony
dealing
with
either
transporting
or
the
bringing
in
unlawfully
of
aliens
and
further,
that
a
man
who
comes
back
the
second
time
after
having
been
deported
is
not
just
a
person
we're
going
to
slap
on
the
wrist
but
who
is
subject
to
a
felony
prosecution
under
8
u.s.c.
1326.
this
is
criminal
business.
further,
the
other
difficulty
is
in
this
particular
matter
is
the
scope
with
the
search.
now,
counsel
has
said
that
there
are
few
cases
litigated
about
how
far
the
immigration
service
go.
i
think
there
is
quite
a
few
and
not
only
that,
but
at
the
district
court
level,
we
had
a
case
where
the
agent
with
his
unique
olfactory
senses
discovered
what
he
thought
was
marijuana
by
sniffing
hard
in
the
vehicle.
he
sniffed
so
hard
that
he
opened
up
the
suitcase
and
there
it
was,
narcotics.
he
went
to
court.
the
only
trouble
was
when
the
motion
to
suppress
was
granted,
it
was
cocaine
in
the
suitcase
rather
than
marijuana.
another
situation
turned
up
on
how
far
they
go
in
locating
aliens.
there
were
two
suitcases
together.
neither
one
of
which
would
hold
an
alien
and
they
searched
both
trunks
and
the
court
said,
well
that
is
not
a
very
good
thing,
they
had
it
go
all
the
way
to
the
ninth
circuit,
you
should
have
pushed
the
cases
apart
before
you
started
to
look
for
an
alien
because
it
although
was
physical
possible.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
gymnastics
that
go
on
to
allow
legitimate
law
enforcement
inquiry.
but
i
think
in
this
area,
if
there
is
a
reasonable
bar
as
to
contraband,
a
far
more
serious,
a
more
harmful
thing
to
our
national
interest.
then
that
bar
should
stand
also
as
to
aliens.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
your
honor,
i
cannot
speak
as
to
the
law
but
speaking
as
american
citizen,
i
think
that
smacks
of
something
that
just
so
grows
with
our
way
of
life
that
i
can
never
understand
congress
doing
something.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
sir,
i
do
not.
but
that
is
at
the
border
and
that
is
if
i
leave
this
country
but
here
in
this
country,
if
i
carried
something
like
that,
i
would
have
to
start
checking
out
my
arm
for
some
type
of
tattoo.
it
smacks
of
a
form
of
government
and
so
(inaudible)
that
i
doubt
if
there
were
something
like
that
dealt
by
congress.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
am
at
a
lost
to
a
respond
to,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
could
not
say
it
is
just
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
so.
i
think
also
a
fifth
amendment
going
back
to
shapiro
versus
thompson
and
all
the
other
ones
on
the
freedom
of
movement
concept.
there
is
clearly
law
and
i
fully
agree
with
the
right
of
aliens,
carrying
identification
cards,
the
i-151,
that
is
i
think
is
legitimate,
clearly
legitimate.
but
for
american
citizen
to
carry
identification
in
that
type
of
area,
it
might
be
also
be
an
equal
protection
argument
that
a
person
is
inside
and
not
on
the
sanitized
zone.
why
would
he
not
have
to
carry
such
an
application.
it's
fraught
with
problems
of
course.
it's
not
here
before
you
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
there
is
much
ingenuity
that
could
be
worked
out
by
congress
that
was
not
handled
in
this
particular
case
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
troublesome
aspects.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
thank
you
so
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
