mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
the
court
presents
some
very
important
fourth
amendment
issues
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
just
brought
out,
but
as
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
indicate,
there
are
important
practical
issues
at
stake
here
too.
and
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
keep
both
sets,
theoretical
and
practical,
of
these
issues
are
carefully
in
mind
in
tending
to
the
arguments
and
in
resolving
the
disputes
between
the
parties.
first
of
all,
it's
important
i
think
to
give
a
little
background
on
what
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
are.
the
case,
the
search
and
seizure
issue
arose
originally
on
stipulated
facts
on
a
motion
to
suppress
and
it
was
stipulated
that
two
border
patrol
agents,
members
of
the
uniformed
service
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
with
the
responsibility
for
controlling
illegal
entry
of
aliens
into
the
united
states,
were
conducting
a
roving
patrol
on
a
state
highway,
highway
78
in
the
south
eastern
part
of
california.
in
order
to
clarify
the
stipulated
facts
and
to
give
the
court
some
further
sense
of
the
topography,
we
have
included
in
our
brief
a
map
of
the
area
involved
to
indicate
the
interrelationship
of
the
points
involved
and
if
i
may
respectfully
direct
the
courtâ€™s
attention
to
the
map
which
we
had
the
army
map
service
prepare,
rather
quickly
i
confess,
so
that
it
would
be
compact
and
yet
would
focus
on
the
important
areas
in
question.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
would
suggest
that
if
necessary
this
would
be
a
subject
to
petition
notice,
since
these
are
indisputable
geographical
features,
but
we're
just
trying
to
clarify
what
stipulated
facts
are.
the
stipulation
was
that
highway
78
on
which
they
stopped,
at
a
place,
just
south
of
glamis,
california
is
about
the
only
north-south
highway
in
southern
california
leading
away
from
the
mexican
border
that
does
not
have
an
established
checkpoint
on
it
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
frequently
patrolled
by
the
border
patrol.
highway
78
of
course
is
an
even
numbered
highway
generally
runs
east
and
west
and
we
have
included
this
map
to
show
that
the
portion
of
the
highway
involved
here
where
it
runs
near
the
mexican
border
although
it
never
touches
the
border,
runs
generally
north
easterly.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
but
i
believe
the
california
system
is
the
same
as
the
general
federal
system.
in
any
event,
down
in
the
lower
left-hand
corner
of
the
case
begins,
according
to
the
stipulated
facts,
that's
the
border
crossing
point,
at
calexico,
california,
the
sister
city
of
mexicali,
mexico,
the
point
from
which
petitioner
can
see
that
he
at
least
began
his
journey.
he
said
that
he
picked
up
the
automobile
that
was
stopped
and
searched
across
the
border
in
calexico.
he
said
he
was
driving
up
to
blythe,
california
which
is
in
the
extreme
top
right-hand
corner
of
the
map,
the
little
yellow
area
is
the
town
of
blythe.
the
only
road
that
leads
through
this
approximately
120
mile
drive
across
mountains
and
generally
dessert,
is
highway
78
and
as
the
court
can
see,
glamis
is
circled
almost
on
the
center
of
the
map.
although
it
is
shown
as
a
town,
the
atlas
that
i,
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
believe
also,
it
might
be
a
subject
of
official
notice
the
official
atlas'
list,
the
population
of
glamis
is
somewhere
between
10
and
100
people.
but
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
suggest
is
this
was
a
desolate
area.
this
was
conceded
at
the
trial
on
the
merits.
the
border
patrol
agents
testified
as
did
petitioner
and
it
was
brought
out
that
this
was
desert
country,
the
highway
is
partially
unpaved
and
the
stop
took
place
at
about
sometime
after
midnight
and
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
just
south
so
that
would
be
right
of
--
as
i
interpret
the
record,
that
would
be
just
before
he
arrived
at
glamis.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
but
the
testimony
of
the
trial
was
south
and
that
would
be
consistent
though,
your
honor
with
the
idea
that
he
was
driving
generally
from
the
border
area
north
of
blythe.
so
if
you
look
in
the
map
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
78,
it
cuts
across
and
then
goes
up.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
goes
up
towards
the
(voice
overlap).
yes
sir.
the
additional
facts
in
the
case,
apart
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
rather
desolate
area,
according
to
the
stipulation
was
that
this
is
a
road
that
is
known
by
border
patrol
agents
to
be
used
by
alien
smugglers.
it
was
so
agreed
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
frequently
subjected
to
roving
patrols.
the
volume
of
traffic
on
the
road
is
such
that
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
practical
to
maintain
a
permanent
checkpoint
for
aliens
trying
to
enter
the
interior.
in
our
brief,
we
have
suggested
again
this
is
outside
the
record,
some
statistics
showing
the
actual
experience
on
this
road
and
they
are
included
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief.
the
agents
decided
to
stop
this
car,
acting
pursuant
to
the
statutory
power
that
congress
conferred
in
1946
to
stop
vehicles
and
to
search
them
for
aliens
and
i
have
to
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
custom
search
and
all
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
reviewed
this
issue
have
distinguished
searches
for
contraband
from
searches
for
aliens
as
has
congress.
so
we're
talking
about
a
distinction
made
not
by
the
attorney
general,
but
by
congress.
the
statute
enacted
in
1946
authorized
a
search
for
aliens
within
a
reasonable
distance
to
the
border.
the
regulation
promulgated
in
1952
which
is
printed
in
our
brief
fixes
100
miles
as
the
outside
limit
for
a
reasonable
distance
except
as
mr.
justice
stewart
and
counsel
agreed
for
airport
entries
in
the
interior
for
example.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
suggest
mr.
justice
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
when
you
get
to
the
reasonable
mis-balance,
the
extent
of
the
intrusion
that's
involved
here
is
much
less
than
it
would
be
if
congress
has
done
the
same
thing
with
contraband.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
what
the
border
patrol
agents
must
do.
all
they
can
do
under
their
statutory
power
is
to
examine
the
car
for
aliens.
and
we
have
cited
the
statistics
in
discussing
the
searches
at
checkpoints
to
show
that
approximately
40%,
2
million,
20%
of
the
ten
million
cars
that
pass
through
checkpoints
are
stopped
for
interrogation,
that
is
a
request
to
the
driver
and
the
passengers
as
to
whether
they
are
aliens
or
american
nationals.
only
about
20%
of
the
number
of
cars
stopped
at
checkpoints,
about
400,000
is
subjected
to
any
search
or
inspection
and
that
is
only
the
trunk
area.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
frequently,
he
does
not
explain
the
objectives
first.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
right.
if
he
goes
beyond
looking
into
areas
where
aliens
as
a
practical
matter
can
be
hidden
and
have
been
hidden.
we
have
cited
cases,
not
just
speculation,
but
cases
in
which
aliens
have
been
found
hiding
under
the
hoods
of
cars.
we
have
cited
cases
in
which,
well
in
this
case
though
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
justice,
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
border
patrol
tries
to
do
this
is
because
the
conditions
under
which
aliens
are
smuggled
into
the
country
are
(inaudbile).
they
are
--
almost
some
of
them
are
smothered
and
some
of
the
vehicles
that
they
are
packed
into
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
happens,
there
was
a
recent
seizure
of
a
fuel
oil
truck
that
was
two-thirds
loaded
with
fuel
oil
and
a
central
compartment
had
been
made
and
there
were
22
mexican
aliens
crammed
in
there
and
they
were
standing
in
knee
deep
inflammable
oil
when
the
border
patrol
finally
detected
them.
these
are
some
of
the
practical
aspects.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
at
all
unreasonable.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
now,
we
have
also
have
in
the
stipulated
facts
here
the
agreement
and
it
was
later
testified
to
a
trial
by
the
border
patrol
agents
that
they
had
been
advised
by
intelligence
bulletins
from
the
border
patrol
that
this
particular
kind
of
smuggling
technique
was
being
used
that
is
that,
the
rear
seat
springs
of
a
car
were
being
removed
and
aliens
and
perhaps
two
aliens
could
sit
between
the
seat
frame
and
the
cushion.
now,
it's
not
in
the
stipulated
facts
but
it
was
testified
to
a
trial
before
the
suppression
motion
was
renewed
and
again
denied
that
when
the
agents
stopped
this
car,
they
looked
in
the
trunk
first
and
it
was
only
if
i
may
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
in
the
process
of
describing
what
actually
occurred
in
this
case
and
it
reached
the
point
of
describing
the
stop
of
the
vehicle
that
petitioner
was
driving,
a
car
which
he
said
did
not
belong
to
him
and
which
he
was
simply
driving
up
to
blythe,
california
to
drop
off
as
a
favor
to
some
man
he
had
met
in
a
bar
in
mexicali,
mexico.
but
the
agents
as
is
customary
in
inspecting
vehicles
for
aliens,
looked
first
in
the
trunk
of
the
automobile
which
would
of
course
be
the
natural
place
where
aliens
are
discovered.
officer
shaw
of
the
border
patrol
testified
at
the
trial
that
when
he
looked
in
the
trunk,
he
did
not
see
any
aliens
or
any
other
items
but
saw
that
the
plate
over
the
back
springs
of
a
car
which
of
course
was
visible
from
the
trunk
area,
the
dividing
material
between
the
rear
seat
and
the
trunk
was
unusual.
it
was
the
standard
kind
of
backing.
he
said
it
looked
to
him
like
cardboard
or
some
other
kind
of
light
board
and
he
thought
that,
that
might
indicate
that
this
rear
seat
had
actually
been
altered
and
relying,
he
testified
on
the
intelligence
bulletins
from
the
border
patrol,
he
entered
the
cabin
of
the
automobile,
removed
the
rear
seat
cushion
and
discovered
marijuana.
the
petitioner
was
then
placed
under
arrest
and
a
further
search
of
the
car
turned
up
73
kilo
bricks
of
marijuana,
161
lbs.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
on
the
legal
questions
is
that
under
settled
decisions
of
this
court,
searches
can
be
conducted
as
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
a
fourth
amendment
even
though
there
may
not
be
probable
cause
to
suspect
that
the
object
of
the
search
is
involved
in
illegal
activity
and
even
if
there
is
no
warrant
specifically
approving
that
search
in
advance.
we
have
relied
on
several
interrelated
series
of
decisions
in
our
brief.
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
basic
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
reasonableness,
that
generally
under
the
warrant
clause
this
implies
the
two
qualifications
must
be
met
in
order
for
search
to
be
reasonable.
that
is,
that
there
must
be
probable
cause
for
the
search
and
that
probable
cause
must
be
adjudicated
in
advance
by
a
magistrate
issuing
a
warrant.
this
court
has
held
in
numbers
of
cases
but
neither
of
those
requirements
is
absolute.
we
rely
primarily
on
the
administrative
inspection
line
of
decisions,
camara
versus
the
san
francisco
municipal
court
and
see
versus
the
city
of
seattle
in
which
this
court
specifically
upheld
the
reasonableness
of
an
area
inspection
program
requiring
access
to
private
homes
as
well
as
to
private
businesses.
even
without
any
reason
to
suspect,
much
less
any
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
was
taking
place
within
the
particular
home
or
business.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
with
the
explicit
caveat
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
warrant
that
was
being
required
in
accordance
with
the
general
presumption
that
warrants
are
necessary
unless
there
are
exigent
circumstances
excusing
it.
mr.
justice
whiteâ€™s
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
the
object
of
the
traditional
administrative
inspection
under
a
building
or
fire
code
is
to
detect
a
rather
fixed
violation
which
cannot
be
quickly
remedied
in
a
structure
which
of
course
is
not
movable.
the
opinion
specifically
leaves
open
the
conduct
of
such
area
inspections
even
without
warrant
if
they
are
reasonable
under
those
circumstances
and
that
exception
was
taken
in
the
other
line
of
cases
that
we
rely
on
colonnade
catering
corporation
and
biswell
in
which
the
court
specifically
held
that
without
even
suspicion
and
without
a
warrant
an
administrative
inspection
to
enforce
regulatory
law
was
valid.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right
and
that
is
clearly
true.
we
have
conceded
that
these
are
not
licensed
activities
that
we're
talking
about,
but
by
the
same
token,
people
who
own
apartments
as
mr.
camara
did
and
camara
against
municipal
court
are
not
in
the
business
of
living
in
apartments,
but
the
court,
mr.
justice,
specifically
left
open
the
possibility
that
going
through
the
balancing
test
which
is
at
the
core
of
the
reasonableness
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
it
might
be
reasonable
to
insist
on
inspecting
his
apartment
even
though
he
is
not
licensed
without
a
warrant.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no.
it
was
conceded
at
trial
that
there
was
no
particular
reason
to
suspect
that
this
car
was
carrying
an
alien.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
that
area?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
yes,
what
we
are
saying
is
the
focus
here
as
in
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
if
the
car
were
marked
as
the
presidentâ€™s
car,
they
would
be
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
position
that
we
are
taking
is
that
the
object,
the
reasonableness
inquiry
in
this
case
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
stopping
of
a
car
under
all
of
the
circumstances.
those
circumstances
include
the
size
of
the
vehicle,
obviously,
a
motorcycle
could
not
be
searched
for
aliens.
the
location
of
the
stop,
is
it
on
a
highway
that
has
a
permanent
checkpoint,
has
the
car
already
been
stopped.
is
it
an
area
that
is
known
to
be
used
by
alien
smugglers?
is
it
fairly
close
to
the
border?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
that's
the
other
thing
that
i
wanted
to
emphasize.
we
have
explicitly
disclaimed
in
our
brief
any
contention
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
search
takes
place
within
a
100
miles
of
the
border
automatically
validates
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
as
applied,
i
would
say
it
is
valid
on
its
face
because
it
talks
about
reasonable
distances
and
that's
a
constitutional
standard.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
(voice
overlap).
up
to
a
100
miles.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
cannot
say
exactly.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
is
relatively
(inaudible)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
we
are
--
again,
this
was
discussed
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
because
as
we
have
tried
to
detail
in
our
brief
and
as
reported
decisions
that
we
have
cited
make
clear
the
common
aliens
smuggling
technique
is
not
for
the
car
to
pass
the
border,
but
for
the
aliens
unlike
contraband
and
this
is
one
of
the
practical
distinctions,
unlike
contraband
which
has
to
be
moved
by
somebody,
the
aliens
can
walk
across
this
almost
2,000-mile
border
even
where
the
rio
grande,
it's
frequently
affordable
and
meet
someone
with
whom
they
have
advance
arrangements
a
mile
or
so
inside
the
american
border
and
be
transported
into
the
interior.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
is
a
practical
matter.
it
is
not
feasible
to
accept
counsel's
suggestions
to
undertake
all
of
these
searches
on
the
physical
border
itself.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
the
same
statute
in
section
13-24
of
title
8,
makes
an
offense
to
smuggle
into
the
united
states
or
to
transport
within
united
states
an
illegal
entrant
who
has
not
submitted
himself
to
inspection
at
the
border
of
entry.
so
it
is
the
same
violation.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
statistics
that
are
officially
published
bear
this
out.
in
fiscal
year
1972,
the
immigration
service
discovered
505,000
deportable
aliens
in
the
united
states.
398,000
of
these,
mr.
justice,
had
not
entered
through
legitimate
ports
of
entry,
that
is
they
had
crossed
the
border
at
places
where
border
patrol,
border
checkpoints
are
not
established
and
about
virtually
all
of
these
393,000
were
mexican
aliens
who
would
come
across
the
border
other
than
at
the
--
through
the
checkpoints.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
applies
to
aliens,
plus
any
alien
who
enters
the
united
states
other
than
at
a
point
designated
and
without
inspection,
commits
a
misdemeanor
for
which
the
possible
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no.
if
you
are
citizen
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
that
we
say
is
one
of
the
important
ingredients
that
the
district
court
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
the
border
is
2,000
miles
long.
there
are
only
1,400
men
stationed
there.
even
if
we
had
the
united
states
army
station
there
which
i
suspect,
i
suggest
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
program
to
adapt
for
a
variety
of
reasons
than
of
the
one
that
is
adapted,
it
is
physically
impossible
to
line
every
foot
of
the
border
to
keep
people
from
walking
across
and
the
circumstance
â€“
the
statistics
bear
this
out.
398,000
people
out
of
the
505,000
deportable
aliens
found
in
the
country
had
crossed
that
other
than
the
approximately
two
dozen
legitimate
ports
of
entry
along
the
mexican
border.
i
should
also
say
in
response
to
a
question
dealing
with
the
possible
criminal
aspect
of
this
that
we
submit
that
there
is
justification
for
relying
on
this
statute
as
an
administrative
enforcement
mechanism
rather
than
as
a
criminal
enforcement
technique.
the
basic
object
of
the
immigration
laws
of
course
is
not
to
put
people
in
jail.
these
are
not
malum
in
se
violations.
this
is
part
of
the
congressional
program
of
regulating
entry
into
the
united
states
and
into
the
interior.
the
statistics
on
prosecution
confirm
this
as
i
have
mentioned
398,000
people
were
located
in
the
last
fiscal
year
who
had
technically
violated
that
misdemeanor
statute
that
i
referred
to
section
13-25
yet
only
about
10,000
of
them,
two-and-half
percent
were
subjected
to
any
prosecution
at
all.
even
on
the
alien
smuggling
or
alien
prosecution
or
alien
transportation
side,
mr.
justice
marshall,
statistics
show
somewhat
similar
results.
about
5,800
transporters
or
smugglers
were
arrested.
the
felony
prosecution
was
authorized
to
not
only
about
10%
of
those
and
a
misdemeanor
prosecution
for
aiding
and
abating.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir,
not
without
probable
cause.
we
have
consistently
taken
up
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
under
all
of
the
circumstances
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
what
happened
in
this
case
was
searching
for
aliens
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
he
didn't
take
it
apart.
he
removed
the
rear
sear
cushion
knowing
that
there
had
in
fact
been
aliens
discovered
in
the
past
under
the
rear
seat
and
as
soon
as
he
looked
in
the
trunk,
he
saw
that
there
was
something
different
about
this
rear
seat.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
without
probable
cause.
whether
he
had
probable
cause,
after
he
looked
in
the
trunk
for
aliens
to
believe
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
a
necessary
factor
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
you
should
stop
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
in
the
pretext
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
have
been
three
or
four
or
five
reported
decisions
that
i
have
seen
over
the
last
20
years
in
which
courts
of
appeals
have
said,
although
you
legitimately
stopped
this
car
for
aliens
and
legitimately
looked
in
the
trunk
for
aliens,
when
you
saw
something
that
could
not
contain
an
alien,
since
we
find
you
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
look
for
contraband,
you've
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
looking
in
that
jacket
or
paper
bag
or
small
trunk.
so
that
the
courts
have
applied
the
distinction
that
congress
has
drawn.
congress
has
not
purported
to
authorize
searches
for
contraband
inside
the
border
on
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
we
have
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
out
of
the
398,000
who
entered
the
country
without
inspection
which
means
that
other
than
a
border
crossing
point
about
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
one
fiscal
year
of
1972.
39,000
were
discovered,
39,000
illegal
aliens
were
discovered,
in
traffic
checks,
approximately
10%.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
this
is
in
the
traffic
checking
operation
which
is
inside
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
there
are
three
types.
the
type
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
the
least
frequently
used.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
varies
from
station
to
station,
from
local
to
local.
in
some
regions,
up
to
one-half
of
the
aliens
who
are
discovered
in
one
of
the
three
kinds
of
traffic
checking
operations
are
detected
in
the
roving
patrol
type.
in
other
locals
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
of
course
is
a
circumstance
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
appraising
what
this
court
in
camara
and
see
appraised,
the
general
reasonableness
of
the
administrative
program.
once
you
start
changing
the
factors
being
weighed
in
the
scales
and
the
balance
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
in
our
brief,
and
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
this
was
not
in
the
record
because
no
one
--
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
we
have
made
the
representation
that
on
this
road
in
one
fiscal
year,
i
believe,
it
has
been
a
192
aliens
were
actually
discovered
as
part
of
the
roving
patrol
because
there
is
no
fixed
or
temporary
fact.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
how
many
out
of
the
39,000
and
i
do
not
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
believe
that's
true,
but
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
cannot
give
you
that
statistic.
i
can
say
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
that
statistic
in
there.
at
the
same
time
that
the
192
aliens
were
discovered,
there
were
five
drug
seizures.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
statistics
that
i
have
don't
show
whether
they
were
joint
or
in
addition
but
i
would
suggest
that
indicates
that
our
experienced
bears
out
that
the
real
thrust
of
this
is
looking
for
aliens
rather
than
and
as
i
say,
the
reported
decisions
do
not
indicate
that
there
has
been
any
abuse
of
this
power
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
are
concerned
with
this,
the
fifth,
the
tenth
and
then
the
ninth
have
all
specifically
upheld
this
statute
and
this
regulation
as
a
reasonable
exercise
of
congressional
authority
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
of
administrative
interpretation
using
the
case
by
case
method
to
analyze
each
particular
search
under
it.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
that
was
stipulated.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
under
roving
patrols
on
this
road
and
if
this
kind
of
inspection
program
is
held
unconstitutional
then
there
will
be
--
i
must
point
out
that
the
same
rationale
would
presumably
apply
to
the
fixed
and
the
temporary
checkpoints
inside
the
border.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
unless
you
wanted
to
say
as
in
palmor
case
i
might
point
out
pending
before
this
court
involving
also
the
d.c.
court
reorganization
act,
the
validity
of
a
stop
or
spot
check
of
an
automobile
for
a
license
and
registration
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
before
the
court.
counsel
in
that
case
is
arguing
that
a
universal
check
at
a
road
block
would
be
all
right,
but
selectively
stopping
people
would
not
be.
conceivably,
that
could
be
a
distinction
between
roving
patrols
and
fixed
checkpoints.
but
if
the
court
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
if
the
court
invalidated
the
roving
checkpoints,
so
i
would
be
back
here
next
term
making
that
distinction
i
suspect,
but
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
roving
patrol
and
the
other
two
involve
established
checkpoints.
one
is
a
permanent
checkpoint.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
no,
no.
these
are
all
inside
the
border.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
under
the
authority
of
this
statute
to
stop
in
the
interior
of
the
border
within
a
reasonable
distance.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
a
permanent
checkpoint
that
is
a
large
capital
structure.
it's
built
right
across
the
highway
and
it
has
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we
have
argued
that
in
our
brief
because
so
many
people
cross
at
other
than
the
two
dozen
or
so
approved
ports
of
entry
that
what
these
permanent
checkpoints
stopped
in
the
interior,
they
come
at
confluence
of
roads
and
they
are
also
away
from
the
border
because
there
is
a
lot
of
ordinary
border
crossing
traffic
that
goes
on
legitimately
and
it
would
be
disproportionately
interfering
with
that
kind
of
legitimate
traffic
to
do
all
of
this
kind
of
inspection
at
the
border.
so
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
permanent
or
temporary
checkpoints
within
the
interior
that
local
traffic
has
been
filtered
out.
there
are
about
13
permanent
checkpoints,
all
but
one
more
than
25
miles
from
the
border
and
all
less
of
course
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well
no.
there
are
13
permanent
checkpoints,
12
of
them
are
more
than
25
miles
from
the
border.
one
is
closer,
the
one
at
the
laredo
was
closer.
and
temporary
checkpoints
can
be
established
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
avoid
alien
smugglers
using
roads
that
bypass
the
established
checkpoints.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
is
the
same
procedure
that's
followed
at
a
permanent
checkpoint
and
we
have
given
the
statistics
on
our
brief.
approximately
10
million
cars
passed
through
temporary
and
permanent
checkpoints
in
the
last
fiscal
year.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
no,
only
the
canadian.
there
are
only
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
are
only
measures
like
this
on
the
mexican
border
because
95%
of
the
immigration
problem
is
at
the
mexican
border.
the
statistics
that
the
immigration
service
has
provided
indicate
that
about
10
million
cars
pass
through
one
or
two
of
these
types
of
checkpoints
near
the
mexican
border.
about
2
million,
20%
were
stopped
only
for
questioning.
are
you
an
american
citizen?
of
the
numbers
stopped,
only
about
another
20%
or
400,000
were
subjected
to
any
inspection,
that
is
looking
in
the
trunk
and
only
about
2,000,
excuse
me
2%
of
those
inspected
or
about
8,000
cars
over
fiscal
year
out
of
10
million
were
subjected
to
searches
under
the
hoods
or
under
the
rear
seats.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
not
that
i
have
ever
seen.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
provision
was
added
in
1952.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
regulation
was
added
in
1952.
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court
on
the
search
of
vehicles
within
100
miles
was
enacted
in
1946.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it's
flexibility
following
the
factors
that
are
set
in
the
regulations
considering
topography,
confluence
of
arteries,
inconvenience
to
the
traveling,
public,
population
density
and
reliable
information.
the
local
district
director
decides
generally
where
to
set
these
up
but
in
the
case
of
the
permanent
checkpoints,
since
these
are
large
capitals
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
local
district
determination
because
this
was
a
roving
patrol
rather
than
a
fixed
checkpoint.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
is
not
any
explicit
determination
that
is
left
generally
to
administer
the
supervision
and
in
implementing
the
statute.
i
would
submit
that
this
is
like
the
executive
field
level
discretion
that
has
to
be
exercised
under
an
arrest
statute.
the
officer
has
to
make
his
judgment
on
the
spot
subject
to
some
guidance.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
none
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
there
is
a
checkpoint
on
highway
78
to
the
west
of
brawley,
that
would
be
off
to
the
left
of
the
map,
but
40
miles
are
more
from
where
this
took
place.
but
the
stipulated
evidence
and
at
this
court
with
what
i
understand
the
actual
experience
to
be
is
that
in
that
40
mile
or
so,
slice
of
the
border
or
more
that
is
represented
by
this
map,
there
is
no
permanent
or
temporary
border
patrol
or
checkpoint.
highway
78,
as
you
will
see
from
the
map
is
about
the
only
road
that
cuts
across
this
dessert.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
it
runs
--
highway
78
runs
through
brawley.
it's
also
called
u.s.
highway
99
when
it
is
going
to
the
city
of
brawley,
but
it
comes
--
it
cuts
through
glamis,
the
town
of
glamis.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
a
regular
border
station.
that
is
a
port
of
entry.
we're
talking
in
this
case
about
alien
checkpoints
not
at
the
border.
calexico
is
one
of
the
five
ports
of
entry
in
southern
california,
but
the
statistics
that
i
suggest
to
the
court
showed
that
398,000
people
--
393,000
of
the
mexican
aliens
entered
at
other
than
one
of
these
borders.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
doesn't
in
the
sense
that
we're
using.
well,
you're
talking
about
permanent
and
temporary
checkpoints
as
checkpoints
beyond
the
border
of
the
united
states
established
under
this
statutory
authority.
it's
conceded
by
both
sides
that
a
point
on
the
border
and
if
someone
had
crossed
at
the
border
and
presented
himself
for
inspection
as
other
statutes
required,
there
could
have
been
a
routine
inspection
and
thorough
concluding
physical
search
of
the
person
without
probable
cause
or
without
a
warrant.
but
we're
talking
here
about
power
of
congress
to
establish
a
mechanism
for
enforcement
of
the
alien,
smuggling
and
illegal
entry
controls
that
authorizes
some
inspections
inside
the
border
and
these
are
the
permanent
and
temporary
checkpoints
and
roving
patrols
that
we're
talking
about
that
are
implemented
under
the
statute
and
regulation.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
the
court
presents
some
very
important
fourth
amendment
issues
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
just
brought
out,
but
as
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
indicate,
there
are
important
practical
issues
at
stake
here
too.
and
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
keep
both
sets,
theoretical
and
practical,
of
these
issues
are
carefully
in
mind
in
tending
to
the
arguments
and
in
resolving
the
disputes
between
the
parties.
first
of
all,
it's
important
i
think
to
give
a
little
background
on
what
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
are.
the
case,
the
search
and
seizure
issue
arose
originally
on
stipulated
facts
on
a
motion
to
suppress
and
it
was
stipulated
that
two
border
patrol
agents,
members
of
the
uniformed
service
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
with
the
responsibility
for
controlling
illegal
entry
of
aliens
into
the
united
states,
were
conducting
a
roving
patrol
on
a
state
highway,
highway
78
in
the
south
eastern
part
of
california.
in
order
to
clarify
the
stipulated
facts
and
to
give
the
court
some
further
sense
of
the
topography,
we
have
included
in
our
brief
a
map
of
the
area
involved
to
indicate
the
interrelationship
of
the
points
involved
and
if
i
may
respectfully
direct
the
courtâ€™s
attention
to
the
map
which
we
had
the
army
map
service
prepare,
rather
quickly
i
confess,
so
that
it
would
be
compact
and
yet
would
focus
on
the
important
areas
in
question.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
would
suggest
that
if
necessary
this
would
be
a
subject
to
petition
notice,
since
these
are
indisputable
geographical
features,
but
we're
just
trying
to
clarify
what
stipulated
facts
are.
the
stipulation
was
that
highway
78
on
which
they
stopped,
at
a
place,
just
south
of
glamis,
california
is
about
the
only
north-south
highway
in
southern
california
leading
away
from
the
mexican
border
that
does
not
have
an
established
checkpoint
on
it
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
frequently
patrolled
by
the
border
patrol.
highway
78
of
course
is
an
even
numbered
highway
generally
runs
east
and
west
and
we
have
included
this
map
to
show
that
the
portion
of
the
highway
involved
here
where
it
runs
near
the
mexican
border
although
it
never
touches
the
border,
runs
generally
north
easterly.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
but
i
believe
the
california
system
is
the
same
as
the
general
federal
system.
in
any
event,
down
in
the
lower
left-hand
corner
of
the
case
begins,
according
to
the
stipulated
facts,
that's
the
border
crossing
point,
at
calexico,
california,
the
sister
city
of
mexicali,
mexico,
the
point
from
which
petitioner
can
see
that
he
at
least
began
his
journey.
he
said
that
he
picked
up
the
automobile
that
was
stopped
and
searched
across
the
border
in
calexico.
he
said
he
was
driving
up
to
blythe,
california
which
is
in
the
extreme
top
right-hand
corner
of
the
map,
the
little
yellow
area
is
the
town
of
blythe.
the
only
road
that
leads
through
this
approximately
120
mile
drive
across
mountains
and
generally
dessert,
is
highway
78
and
as
the
court
can
see,
glamis
is
circled
almost
on
the
center
of
the
map.
although
it
is
shown
as
a
town,
the
atlas
that
i,
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
believe
also,
it
might
be
a
subject
of
official
notice
the
official
atlas'
list,
the
population
of
glamis
is
somewhere
between
10
and
100
people.
but
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
suggest
is
this
was
a
desolate
area.
this
was
conceded
at
the
trial
on
the
merits.
the
border
patrol
agents
testified
as
did
petitioner
and
it
was
brought
out
that
this
was
desert
country,
the
highway
is
partially
unpaved
and
the
stop
took
place
at
about
sometime
after
midnight
and
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
just
south
so
that
would
be
right
of
--
as
i
interpret
the
record,
that
would
be
just
before
he
arrived
at
glamis.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
but
the
testimony
of
the
trial
was
south
and
that
would
be
consistent
though,
your
honor
with
the
idea
that
he
was
driving
generally
from
the
border
area
north
of
blythe.
so
if
you
look
in
the
map
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
78,
it
cuts
across
and
then
goes
up.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
goes
up
towards
the
(voice
overlap).
yes
sir.
the
additional
facts
in
the
case,
apart
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
rather
desolate
area,
according
to
the
stipulation
was
that
this
is
a
road
that
is
known
by
border
patrol
agents
to
be
used
by
alien
smugglers.
it
was
so
agreed
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
frequently
subjected
to
roving
patrols.
the
volume
of
traffic
on
the
road
is
such
that
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
practical
to
maintain
a
permanent
checkpoint
for
aliens
trying
to
enter
the
interior.
in
our
brief,
we
have
suggested
again
this
is
outside
the
record,
some
statistics
showing
the
actual
experience
on
this
road
and
they
are
included
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief.
the
agents
decided
to
stop
this
car,
acting
pursuant
to
the
statutory
power
that
congress
conferred
in
1946
to
stop
vehicles
and
to
search
them
for
aliens
and
i
have
to
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
custom
search
and
all
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
reviewed
this
issue
have
distinguished
searches
for
contraband
from
searches
for
aliens
as
has
congress.
so
we're
talking
about
a
distinction
made
not
by
the
attorney
general,
but
by
congress.
the
statute
enacted
in
1946
authorized
a
search
for
aliens
within
a
reasonable
distance
to
the
border.
the
regulation
promulgated
in
1952
which
is
printed
in
our
brief
fixes
100
miles
as
the
outside
limit
for
a
reasonable
distance
except
as
mr.
justice
stewart
and
counsel
agreed
for
airport
entries
in
the
interior
for
example.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
suggest
mr.
justice
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
when
you
get
to
the
reasonable
mis-balance,
the
extent
of
the
intrusion
that's
involved
here
is
much
less
than
it
would
be
if
congress
has
done
the
same
thing
with
contraband.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
what
the
border
patrol
agents
must
do.
all
they
can
do
under
their
statutory
power
is
to
examine
the
car
for
aliens.
and
we
have
cited
the
statistics
in
discussing
the
searches
at
checkpoints
to
show
that
approximately
40%,
2
million,
20%
of
the
ten
million
cars
that
pass
through
checkpoints
are
stopped
for
interrogation,
that
is
a
request
to
the
driver
and
the
passengers
as
to
whether
they
are
aliens
or
american
nationals.
only
about
20%
of
the
number
of
cars
stopped
at
checkpoints,
about
400,000
is
subjected
to
any
search
or
inspection
and
that
is
only
the
trunk
area.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
frequently,
he
does
not
explain
the
objectives
first.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
right.
if
he
goes
beyond
looking
into
areas
where
aliens
as
a
practical
matter
can
be
hidden
and
have
been
hidden.
we
have
cited
cases,
not
just
speculation,
but
cases
in
which
aliens
have
been
found
hiding
under
the
hoods
of
cars.
we
have
cited
cases
in
which,
well
in
this
case
though
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
justice,
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
border
patrol
tries
to
do
this
is
because
the
conditions
under
which
aliens
are
smuggled
into
the
country
are
(inaudbile).
they
are
--
almost
some
of
them
are
smothered
and
some
of
the
vehicles
that
they
are
packed
into
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
happens,
there
was
a
recent
seizure
of
a
fuel
oil
truck
that
was
two-thirds
loaded
with
fuel
oil
and
a
central
compartment
had
been
made
and
there
were
22
mexican
aliens
crammed
in
there
and
they
were
standing
in
knee
deep
inflammable
oil
when
the
border
patrol
finally
detected
them.
these
are
some
of
the
practical
aspects.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
at
all
unreasonable.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
now,
we
have
also
have
in
the
stipulated
facts
here
the
agreement
and
it
was
later
testified
to
a
trial
by
the
border
patrol
agents
that
they
had
been
advised
by
intelligence
bulletins
from
the
border
patrol
that
this
particular
kind
of
smuggling
technique
was
being
used
that
is
that,
the
rear
seat
springs
of
a
car
were
being
removed
and
aliens
and
perhaps
two
aliens
could
sit
between
the
seat
frame
and
the
cushion.
now,
it's
not
in
the
stipulated
facts
but
it
was
testified
to
a
trial
before
the
suppression
motion
was
renewed
and
again
denied
that
when
the
agents
stopped
this
car,
they
looked
in
the
trunk
first
and
it
was
only
if
i
may
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
in
the
process
of
describing
what
actually
occurred
in
this
case
and
it
reached
the
point
of
describing
the
stop
of
the
vehicle
that
petitioner
was
driving,
a
car
which
he
said
did
not
belong
to
him
and
which
he
was
simply
driving
up
to
blythe,
california
to
drop
off
as
a
favor
to
some
man
he
had
met
in
a
bar
in
mexicali,
mexico.
but
the
agents
as
is
customary
in
inspecting
vehicles
for
aliens,
looked
first
in
the
trunk
of
the
automobile
which
would
of
course
be
the
natural
place
where
aliens
are
discovered.
officer
shaw
of
the
border
patrol
testified
at
the
trial
that
when
he
looked
in
the
trunk,
he
did
not
see
any
aliens
or
any
other
items
but
saw
that
the
plate
over
the
back
springs
of
a
car
which
of
course
was
visible
from
the
trunk
area,
the
dividing
material
between
the
rear
seat
and
the
trunk
was
unusual.
it
was
the
standard
kind
of
backing.
he
said
it
looked
to
him
like
cardboard
or
some
other
kind
of
light
board
and
he
thought
that,
that
might
indicate
that
this
rear
seat
had
actually
been
altered
and
relying,
he
testified
on
the
intelligence
bulletins
from
the
border
patrol,
he
entered
the
cabin
of
the
automobile,
removed
the
rear
seat
cushion
and
discovered
marijuana.
the
petitioner
was
then
placed
under
arrest
and
a
further
search
of
the
car
turned
up
73
kilo
bricks
of
marijuana,
161
lbs.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
on
the
legal
questions
is
that
under
settled
decisions
of
this
court,
searches
can
be
conducted
as
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
a
fourth
amendment
even
though
there
may
not
be
probable
cause
to
suspect
that
the
object
of
the
search
is
involved
in
illegal
activity
and
even
if
there
is
no
warrant
specifically
approving
that
search
in
advance.
we
have
relied
on
several
interrelated
series
of
decisions
in
our
brief.
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
basic
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
reasonableness,
that
generally
under
the
warrant
clause
this
implies
the
two
qualifications
must
be
met
in
order
for
search
to
be
reasonable.
that
is,
that
there
must
be
probable
cause
for
the
search
and
that
probable
cause
must
be
adjudicated
in
advance
by
a
magistrate
issuing
a
warrant.
this
court
has
held
in
numbers
of
cases
but
neither
of
those
requirements
is
absolute.
we
rely
primarily
on
the
administrative
inspection
line
of
decisions,
camara
versus
the
san
francisco
municipal
court
and
see
versus
the
city
of
seattle
in
which
this
court
specifically
upheld
the
reasonableness
of
an
area
inspection
program
requiring
access
to
private
homes
as
well
as
to
private
businesses.
even
without
any
reason
to
suspect,
much
less
any
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
was
taking
place
within
the
particular
home
or
business.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
with
the
explicit
caveat
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
warrant
that
was
being
required
in
accordance
with
the
general
presumption
that
warrants
are
necessary
unless
there
are
exigent
circumstances
excusing
it.
mr.
justice
whiteâ€™s
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
the
object
of
the
traditional
administrative
inspection
under
a
building
or
fire
code
is
to
detect
a
rather
fixed
violation
which
cannot
be
quickly
remedied
in
a
structure
which
of
course
is
not
movable.
the
opinion
specifically
leaves
open
the
conduct
of
such
area
inspections
even
without
warrant
if
they
are
reasonable
under
those
circumstances
and
that
exception
was
taken
in
the
other
line
of
cases
that
we
rely
on
colonnade
catering
corporation
and
biswell
in
which
the
court
specifically
held
that
without
even
suspicion
and
without
a
warrant
an
administrative
inspection
to
enforce
regulatory
law
was
valid.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right
and
that
is
clearly
true.
we
have
conceded
that
these
are
not
licensed
activities
that
we're
talking
about,
but
by
the
same
token,
people
who
own
apartments
as
mr.
camara
did
and
camara
against
municipal
court
are
not
in
the
business
of
living
in
apartments,
but
the
court,
mr.
justice,
specifically
left
open
the
possibility
that
going
through
the
balancing
test
which
is
at
the
core
of
the
reasonableness
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
it
might
be
reasonable
to
insist
on
inspecting
his
apartment
even
though
he
is
not
licensed
without
a
warrant.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no.
it
was
conceded
at
trial
that
there
was
no
particular
reason
to
suspect
that
this
car
was
carrying
an
alien.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
that
area?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
yes,
what
we
are
saying
is
the
focus
here
as
in
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
if
the
car
were
marked
as
the
presidentâ€™s
car,
they
would
be
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
position
that
we
are
taking
is
that
the
object,
the
reasonableness
inquiry
in
this
case
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
stopping
of
a
car
under
all
of
the
circumstances.
those
circumstances
include
the
size
of
the
vehicle,
obviously,
a
motorcycle
could
not
be
searched
for
aliens.
the
location
of
the
stop,
is
it
on
a
highway
that
has
a
permanent
checkpoint,
has
the
car
already
been
stopped.
is
it
an
area
that
is
known
to
be
used
by
alien
smugglers?
is
it
fairly
close
to
the
border?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
that's
the
other
thing
that
i
wanted
to
emphasize.
we
have
explicitly
disclaimed
in
our
brief
any
contention
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
search
takes
place
within
a
100
miles
of
the
border
automatically
validates
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
as
applied,
i
would
say
it
is
valid
on
its
face
because
it
talks
about
reasonable
distances
and
that's
a
constitutional
standard.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
(voice
overlap).
up
to
a
100
miles.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
cannot
say
exactly.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
is
relatively
(inaudible)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
we
are
--
again,
this
was
discussed
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
because
as
we
have
tried
to
detail
in
our
brief
and
as
reported
decisions
that
we
have
cited
make
clear
the
common
aliens
smuggling
technique
is
not
for
the
car
to
pass
the
border,
but
for
the
aliens
unlike
contraband
and
this
is
one
of
the
practical
distinctions,
unlike
contraband
which
has
to
be
moved
by
somebody,
the
aliens
can
walk
across
this
almost
2,000-mile
border
even
where
the
rio
grande,
it's
frequently
affordable
and
meet
someone
with
whom
they
have
advance
arrangements
a
mile
or
so
inside
the
american
border
and
be
transported
into
the
interior.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
is
a
practical
matter.
it
is
not
feasible
to
accept
counsel's
suggestions
to
undertake
all
of
these
searches
on
the
physical
border
itself.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
the
same
statute
in
section
13-24
of
title
8,
makes
an
offense
to
smuggle
into
the
united
states
or
to
transport
within
united
states
an
illegal
entrant
who
has
not
submitted
himself
to
inspection
at
the
border
of
entry.
so
it
is
the
same
violation.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
statistics
that
are
officially
published
bear
this
out.
in
fiscal
year
1972,
the
immigration
service
discovered
505,000
deportable
aliens
in
the
united
states.
398,000
of
these,
mr.
justice,
had
not
entered
through
legitimate
ports
of
entry,
that
is
they
had
crossed
the
border
at
places
where
border
patrol,
border
checkpoints
are
not
established
and
about
virtually
all
of
these
393,000
were
mexican
aliens
who
would
come
across
the
border
other
than
at
the
--
through
the
checkpoints.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
applies
to
aliens,
plus
any
alien
who
enters
the
united
states
other
than
at
a
point
designated
and
without
inspection,
commits
a
misdemeanor
for
which
the
possible
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no.
if
you
are
citizen
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
that
we
say
is
one
of
the
important
ingredients
that
the
district
court
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
the
border
is
2,000
miles
long.
there
are
only
1,400
men
stationed
there.
even
if
we
had
the
united
states
army
station
there
which
i
suspect,
i
suggest
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
program
to
adapt
for
a
variety
of
reasons
than
of
the
one
that
is
adapted,
it
is
physically
impossible
to
line
every
foot
of
the
border
to
keep
people
from
walking
across
and
the
circumstance
â€“
the
statistics
bear
this
out.
398,000
people
out
of
the
505,000
deportable
aliens
found
in
the
country
had
crossed
that
other
than
the
approximately
two
dozen
legitimate
ports
of
entry
along
the
mexican
border.
i
should
also
say
in
response
to
a
question
dealing
with
the
possible
criminal
aspect
of
this
that
we
submit
that
there
is
justification
for
relying
on
this
statute
as
an
administrative
enforcement
mechanism
rather
than
as
a
criminal
enforcement
technique.
the
basic
object
of
the
immigration
laws
of
course
is
not
to
put
people
in
jail.
these
are
not
malum
in
se
violations.
this
is
part
of
the
congressional
program
of
regulating
entry
into
the
united
states
and
into
the
interior.
the
statistics
on
prosecution
confirm
this
as
i
have
mentioned
398,000
people
were
located
in
the
last
fiscal
year
who
had
technically
violated
that
misdemeanor
statute
that
i
referred
to
section
13-25
yet
only
about
10,000
of
them,
two-and-half
percent
were
subjected
to
any
prosecution
at
all.
even
on
the
alien
smuggling
or
alien
prosecution
or
alien
transportation
side,
mr.
justice
marshall,
statistics
show
somewhat
similar
results.
about
5,800
transporters
or
smugglers
were
arrested.
the
felony
prosecution
was
authorized
to
not
only
about
10%
of
those
and
a
misdemeanor
prosecution
for
aiding
and
abating.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir,
not
without
probable
cause.
we
have
consistently
taken
up
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
under
all
of
the
circumstances
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
what
happened
in
this
case
was
searching
for
aliens
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
he
didn't
take
it
apart.
he
removed
the
rear
sear
cushion
knowing
that
there
had
in
fact
been
aliens
discovered
in
the
past
under
the
rear
seat
and
as
soon
as
he
looked
in
the
trunk,
he
saw
that
there
was
something
different
about
this
rear
seat.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
without
probable
cause.
whether
he
had
probable
cause,
after
he
looked
in
the
trunk
for
aliens
to
believe
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
a
necessary
factor
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
you
should
stop
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
in
the
pretext
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
have
been
three
or
four
or
five
reported
decisions
that
i
have
seen
over
the
last
20
years
in
which
courts
of
appeals
have
said,
although
you
legitimately
stopped
this
car
for
aliens
and
legitimately
looked
in
the
trunk
for
aliens,
when
you
saw
something
that
could
not
contain
an
alien,
since
we
find
you
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
look
for
contraband,
you've
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
looking
in
that
jacket
or
paper
bag
or
small
trunk.
so
that
the
courts
have
applied
the
distinction
that
congress
has
drawn.
congress
has
not
purported
to
authorize
searches
for
contraband
inside
the
border
on
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
we
have
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
out
of
the
398,000
who
entered
the
country
without
inspection
which
means
that
other
than
a
border
crossing
point
about
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
one
fiscal
year
of
1972.
39,000
were
discovered,
39,000
illegal
aliens
were
discovered,
in
traffic
checks,
approximately
10%.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
this
is
in
the
traffic
checking
operation
which
is
inside
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
there
are
three
types.
the
type
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
the
least
frequently
used.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
varies
from
station
to
station,
from
local
to
local.
in
some
regions,
up
to
one-half
of
the
aliens
who
are
discovered
in
one
of
the
three
kinds
of
traffic
checking
operations
are
detected
in
the
roving
patrol
type.
in
other
locals
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
of
course
is
a
circumstance
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
appraising
what
this
court
in
camara
and
see
appraised,
the
general
reasonableness
of
the
administrative
program.
once
you
start
changing
the
factors
being
weighed
in
the
scales
and
the
balance
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
in
our
brief,
and
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
this
was
not
in
the
record
because
no
one
--
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
we
have
made
the
representation
that
on
this
road
in
one
fiscal
year,
i
believe,
it
has
been
a
192
aliens
were
actually
discovered
as
part
of
the
roving
patrol
because
there
is
no
fixed
or
temporary
fact.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
how
many
out
of
the
39,000
and
i
do
not
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
believe
that's
true,
but
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
cannot
give
you
that
statistic.
i
can
say
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
that
statistic
in
there.
at
the
same
time
that
the
192
aliens
were
discovered,
there
were
five
drug
seizures.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
statistics
that
i
have
don't
show
whether
they
were
joint
or
in
addition
but
i
would
suggest
that
indicates
that
our
experienced
bears
out
that
the
real
thrust
of
this
is
looking
for
aliens
rather
than
and
as
i
say,
the
reported
decisions
do
not
indicate
that
there
has
been
any
abuse
of
this
power
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
are
concerned
with
this,
the
fifth,
the
tenth
and
then
the
ninth
have
all
specifically
upheld
this
statute
and
this
regulation
as
a
reasonable
exercise
of
congressional
authority
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
of
administrative
interpretation
using
the
case
by
case
method
to
analyze
each
particular
search
under
it.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
that
was
stipulated.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
under
roving
patrols
on
this
road
and
if
this
kind
of
inspection
program
is
held
unconstitutional
then
there
will
be
--
i
must
point
out
that
the
same
rationale
would
presumably
apply
to
the
fixed
and
the
temporary
checkpoints
inside
the
border.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
unless
you
wanted
to
say
as
in
palmor
case
i
might
point
out
pending
before
this
court
involving
also
the
d.c.
court
reorganization
act,
the
validity
of
a
stop
or
spot
check
of
an
automobile
for
a
license
and
registration
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
before
the
court.
counsel
in
that
case
is
arguing
that
a
universal
check
at
a
road
block
would
be
all
right,
but
selectively
stopping
people
would
not
be.
conceivably,
that
could
be
a
distinction
between
roving
patrols
and
fixed
checkpoints.
but
if
the
court
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
if
the
court
invalidated
the
roving
checkpoints,
so
i
would
be
back
here
next
term
making
that
distinction
i
suspect,
but
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
roving
patrol
and
the
other
two
involve
established
checkpoints.
one
is
a
permanent
checkpoint.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
no,
no.
these
are
all
inside
the
border.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
under
the
authority
of
this
statute
to
stop
in
the
interior
of
the
border
within
a
reasonable
distance.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
a
permanent
checkpoint
that
is
a
large
capital
structure.
it's
built
right
across
the
highway
and
it
has
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we
have
argued
that
in
our
brief
because
so
many
people
cross
at
other
than
the
two
dozen
or
so
approved
ports
of
entry
that
what
these
permanent
checkpoints
stopped
in
the
interior,
they
come
at
confluence
of
roads
and
they
are
also
away
from
the
border
because
there
is
a
lot
of
ordinary
border
crossing
traffic
that
goes
on
legitimately
and
it
would
be
disproportionately
interfering
with
that
kind
of
legitimate
traffic
to
do
all
of
this
kind
of
inspection
at
the
border.
so
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
permanent
or
temporary
checkpoints
within
the
interior
that
local
traffic
has
been
filtered
out.
there
are
about
13
permanent
checkpoints,
all
but
one
more
than
25
miles
from
the
border
and
all
less
of
course
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well
no.
there
are
13
permanent
checkpoints,
12
of
them
are
more
than
25
miles
from
the
border.
one
is
closer,
the
one
at
the
laredo
was
closer.
and
temporary
checkpoints
can
be
established
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
avoid
alien
smugglers
using
roads
that
bypass
the
established
checkpoints.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
is
the
same
procedure
that's
followed
at
a
permanent
checkpoint
and
we
have
given
the
statistics
on
our
brief.
approximately
10
million
cars
passed
through
temporary
and
permanent
checkpoints
in
the
last
fiscal
year.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
no,
only
the
canadian.
there
are
only
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
are
only
measures
like
this
on
the
mexican
border
because
95%
of
the
immigration
problem
is
at
the
mexican
border.
the
statistics
that
the
immigration
service
has
provided
indicate
that
about
10
million
cars
pass
through
one
or
two
of
these
types
of
checkpoints
near
the
mexican
border.
about
2
million,
20%
were
stopped
only
for
questioning.
are
you
an
american
citizen?
of
the
numbers
stopped,
only
about
another
20%
or
400,000
were
subjected
to
any
inspection,
that
is
looking
in
the
trunk
and
only
about
2,000,
excuse
me
2%
of
those
inspected
or
about
8,000
cars
over
fiscal
year
out
of
10
million
were
subjected
to
searches
under
the
hoods
or
under
the
rear
seats.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
not
that
i
have
ever
seen.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
provision
was
added
in
1952.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
regulation
was
added
in
1952.
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court
on
the
search
of
vehicles
within
100
miles
was
enacted
in
1946.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it's
flexibility
following
the
factors
that
are
set
in
the
regulations
considering
topography,
confluence
of
arteries,
inconvenience
to
the
traveling,
public,
population
density
and
reliable
information.
the
local
district
director
decides
generally
where
to
set
these
up
but
in
the
case
of
the
permanent
checkpoints,
since
these
are
large
capitals
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
local
district
determination
because
this
was
a
roving
patrol
rather
than
a
fixed
checkpoint.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
is
not
any
explicit
determination
that
is
left
generally
to
administer
the
supervision
and
in
implementing
the
statute.
i
would
submit
that
this
is
like
the
executive
field
level
discretion
that
has
to
be
exercised
under
an
arrest
statute.
the
officer
has
to
make
his
judgment
on
the
spot
subject
to
some
guidance.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
none
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
there
is
a
checkpoint
on
highway
78
to
the
west
of
brawley,
that
would
be
off
to
the
left
of
the
map,
but
40
miles
are
more
from
where
this
took
place.
but
the
stipulated
evidence
and
at
this
court
with
what
i
understand
the
actual
experience
to
be
is
that
in
that
40
mile
or
so,
slice
of
the
border
or
more
that
is
represented
by
this
map,
there
is
no
permanent
or
temporary
border
patrol
or
checkpoint.
highway
78,
as
you
will
see
from
the
map
is
about
the
only
road
that
cuts
across
this
dessert.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
it
runs
--
highway
78
runs
through
brawley.
it's
also
called
u.s.
highway
99
when
it
is
going
to
the
city
of
brawley,
but
it
comes
--
it
cuts
through
glamis,
the
town
of
glamis.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
a
regular
border
station.
that
is
a
port
of
entry.
we're
talking
in
this
case
about
alien
checkpoints
not
at
the
border.
calexico
is
one
of
the
five
ports
of
entry
in
southern
california,
but
the
statistics
that
i
suggest
to
the
court
showed
that
398,000
people
--
393,000
of
the
mexican
aliens
entered
at
other
than
one
of
these
borders.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
doesn't
in
the
sense
that
we're
using.
well,
you're
talking
about
permanent
and
temporary
checkpoints
as
checkpoints
beyond
the
border
of
the
united
states
established
under
this
statutory
authority.
it's
conceded
by
both
sides
that
a
point
on
the
border
and
if
someone
had
crossed
at
the
border
and
presented
himself
for
inspection
as
other
statutes
required,
there
could
have
been
a
routine
inspection
and
thorough
concluding
physical
search
of
the
person
without
probable
cause
or
without
a
warrant.
but
we're
talking
here
about
power
of
congress
to
establish
a
mechanism
for
enforcement
of
the
alien,
smuggling
and
illegal
entry
controls
that
authorizes
some
inspections
inside
the
border
and
these
are
the
permanent
and
temporary
checkpoints
and
roving
patrols
that
we're
talking
about
that
are
implemented
under
the
statute
and
regulation.
thank
you.
