justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
some
circumstances
could
be
held
to
be
un-reasonable
within
a
100-mile?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
regulation
on
its
face
may
not
be
valid
in
all
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
as
a
part
of
the
circumstance
that
would
make
a
search
within
100
miles
from
the
border,
a
reasonable
as
compared
with
some
unreasonable
a
100
miles
searches.
it
would
be,
whether
there
are
some
reason
to
suspect
or
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
car
just
come
from
the
border?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
again,
you
say
that
no
necessity
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
figure
--
do
you
have
figures
about
how
many
aliens
have
been
discovered
in
the
searches
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
a
100
miles
of
the
border?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
that
include
those
that
were
discovered
at
the
border?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
these
were
spot
checks
within
a
100
mile.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
know
about
this
kind
of
check.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
make
a
difference
to
you
or
to
the
government
in
terms
of
reasonableness
if
they
only
discovered
one
alien
out
of
every
million
stops?
justice
byron
r.
white
spot
checking
operation
without
that,
based
on
the
assumption
that
every
now
and
then
we're
going
to
find
an
alien
and
your
claim
is
that
we're
going
to
find
them
up
and
that
justifies
stopping
anybody
who
want
to
within
that
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
know
how
many
out
of
--
out
of
how
many?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
every
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
not
know
how
many
stops
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
checkpoint
on
this
road
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
all
there
is
--
the
only
kind
of
a
stop
that
on
this
road
is
kind
of
the
stop
that
was
made
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
all
192
were
seized?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
checkpoint
is
no
better
within
the
100
miles?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
petition
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
searching
of
real
property
or
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
old
is
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
there
is
a
flexibility
among
the
various
districts
as
to
whether
they
are
having
a
100
or
25
or
five?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
local
district
director
determination?
