mr.
james
a.
chanoux
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
the
question
involved
in
this
case
revolves
around
whether
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
violated
in
reference
to
a
search
and
seizure
of
some
marijuana
that
was
found
in
a
car
driven
by
the
petitioner.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
his
rights
were
violated.
the
government
contends
that
the
search
was
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
it
was
done
by
officers
of
the
boarder
patrol
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
that
the
search
of
petitioner’s
car
was
for
aliens.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
has
a
section
authorizing
warrantless
searches
of
vehicles
for
aliens.
mr.
james
a.
chanoux
i
feel
that
the
issue
would
be
the
same,
your
honor.
i
do
not
feel
that
this
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
james
a.
chanoux
i’m
sorry,
your
honor.
no,
i
do
not
feel
that
there
is
any
distinction
as
to
whether
they
were
searching
for
contraband
or
searching
for
alien.
it's
petitioner’s
contention
that
at
the
least
the
court
should
set
guidelines
or
frame
the
searches
for
illegal
aliens
or
searches
of
vehicles
for
illegally
in
line
with
the
custom
searches
of
vehicles
for
contraband.
the
petitioner
does
not
feel
that
the
custom
services'
hands
have
been
tied
by
the
safeguards
implemented
by
the
courts
in
order
to
give
judicial
sanction
to
certain
facts.
petitioner
does
not
feel
that
in
this
particular
set
of
facts
and
this
case
was
or
this
motion
was
decided
on
a
stipulated
set
of
fact,
does
not
felt
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
that
probable
cause
per
se
existed
to
search
the
car
for
an
illegal
alien
but
rather
that
in
a
search.
under
cases
similar
to
alexander
and
wile,
if
the
court
had
reasonable
suspicion,
reasonable
certainty
that
the
car
being
searched
did
have
an
illegal
alien
then
it
would
be
possible
for
the
search
to
be
justified
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
chanoux
that
is
my
contention,
your
honor,
yes.
it
would
be
possible
to
hold
the
regulation
in
question
unconstitutional.
i
feel
that
would
be
begging
the
question.
we
would
be
left
with
a
standard
that
100
miles
might
not
be
reasonable,
but
the
courts
and
the
officers
would
be
left
with
again
the
statute
or
the
subsection
stating
that
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
boarder.
i
do
not
feel
that
100
miles
is
any
religious
reason
for
stating
that
100
miles
should
be
the
safeguard,
75,
50.
the
attorney
general
could
have
possibly
stated
three
miles
or
three
minutes,
possibly
some
safeguard
is
necessary,
but
i
do
not
feel
that
there
is
any
magic
involved
in
the
100
mile
limit
set
by
--
mr.
james
a.
chanoux
no.
i
again
your
honor
did
not
feel
that
there
is
any
greater
constitutional
safeguards
involved
in
a
three
mile
limit
as
opposed
to
a
100
mile
limit.
mr.
james
a.
chanoux
possibly
certain
distances
might
be
determined
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
james
a.
chanoux
i
would
hate
to
see
the
situation
where
somebody
could
cross
“an
international
boundary
line”
and
then
from
his
nose
at
the,
excuse
me
if
the
court
please.
someone
knows
at
the
boarder
officers
and
sort
of
show
them
that
he
had
some
illegal
contraband
or
had
recently
smuggled
some
