justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
non
stop
the
airplane
flight
from
mexico
city
to
chicago?
certainly
a
search
for
a
contraband
or
for
aliens
could
take
place
in
chicago,
could
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
issue
include
unnecessarily
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that,
certainly
i
think
you
already
conceded,
would
take
care
of
the
situation
where
an
airplane
flies
non-stop
from
london
to
st.
louis?
justice
potter
stewart
but
b
has
all
sorts
of
seeming
safeguards
in
it.
the
district
director
has
to
forward
a
completely
report
with
respect
to
the
matter
to
the
commission
and
justify
anything
within
a
100-mile
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
before
we
move
on,
could
you
give
me
the
spelling
of
mallides
please
and
tell
me
the
date

january
what?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice

stewart
and
where
on
the
road
was
it?
west
of
glamis
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
lot
more
west,
south
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
from
calexico,
he
would
come
up

up
to
brawley,
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
get
on
highway
78?
justice
potter
stewart
and
start
to
east
and
then
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
but
the
court
in
other
cases
did
require
that
a
“warrant”
be
secured?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
you
say
that's
not
a
legitimate
point
of
entry.
is
that
criminal
offense
in
and
of
itself?
if
i
were
in
mexico
and
walked
across
at
the
border
back
to
united
states,
that
point
where
there
was
no
checkpoint,
will
i
be
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense
even
though
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
everybody
who
enters
the

justice

stewart
you
can
walk
across
anywhere.

year,
period?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lacovara,
you
said
there
were
three
different
methods.
one
is
this
roving
patrol.
we
have
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
our
border.
justice
potter
stewart
all
inside
the
border.
justice
potter
stewart
so
one
is
a
roving
patrol,
the
other
is
an
established
checkpoint?
justice
potter
stewart
now
why
would
it
be
there
rather
than
at
the
border?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
other
one
is
a
temporary
checkpoint?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
then
there
is
temporary
checkpoint,
you
set
it
up
for
a
temporary
period
of
time
that
when
during
the
time
it
is
set
up,
do
you
check
every
single
vehicle
coming
through
there?
justice

stewart
at
