mr.
john
c.
buckingham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
court
decision,
denying
appellants'
civil
class
action
for
injunctive
relief
to
enjoin
the
deprivation
of
the
civil
rights
of
the
appellants
and
all
classified
employees
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
appellees
with
state
personnel
board,
initiated
proceedings
against
the
appellants
seeking
to
dismiss
said
appellants
from
employment
by
the
state
corporation
commission
for
alleged
political
activities
under
title
74
going
to
statute
--
section
818.
this
action
by
the
state
personnel
board
precipitated
the
filing
of
the
suit
in
federal
court.
the
questions
presented
on
this
appeal
maybe
briefly
stated
as
follows.
may
a
state
by
statute
proscribe
in
broad
and
general
terms
first
amendment
rights
of
state
employees
and
two,
may
a
state
constitutionally
classify
the
employees
of
some,
but
not
all
of
the
state
agencies
and
broadly
prohibit
the
employees
of
those
agencies
from
enjoying
first
amendment
rights
while
permitting
the
unclassified
employees
of
the
state,
all
other
public
employees
and
the
citizenry
at
large
to
freely
enjoy
the
same.
now
we
urge
to
this
honorable
court,
that
such
proscriptions
by
a
state
statute
are
wanting
in
constitutional
acceptability
are
of
the
first,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
if
the
political
activities
prohibition
provisions
of
the
hatch
act
in
the
previous
case
are
found
to
be
subject
to
successful
challenges
as
being
vague
and
overbroad,
a
fortiori
the
political
activities
prohibition
provision
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
should
be
determined
as
constitutionally
warranted.
if
however,
the
political
activities
prohibition
provisions
of
the
hatch
act
are
found
to
be
constitutionally
sound,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
political
activities
or
proscriptions
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
are
constitutionally
well
found
as
said
proscriptions
are
inherently
distinguishable
from
the
pertinent
portions
of
federal
hatch
act.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
would
suggest
the
hatch
act
is
more
lenient.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
there
were,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
we
feel
in
this
particular
instance
because
facially
the
statutes
involved
which
predicated
the
action
against
the
state
employees
are
both
so
vague
and
broad
as
to
permit
the
federal
courts
under
1983,
because
the
civil
rights
in
question
involved
to
rules
specifically
on
that
statute.
abstention
to
make
all
additional
employees
who
may
have
conducted,
the
state
personnel
board
feel
should
warrant
some
kind
of
action,
prosecutory
action
under
these
two
sections
we
feel
it
is
untenable
when
you
read
the
two
statutes.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
we
feel
in
our
particular
case,
in
this
particular
statute,
as
you
know
in
the
hatch
act
and
further
acts,
there
are
some
proscribed
permitted
activities,
political
activities
perhaps
non
partisan
activities.
the
oklahoma
statute
does
not
describe
any
permitted
political
activities
of
any
kind
other
than
a
private
expression
and
the
right
to
vote
with
the
use
of
such
terms
as
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
they
are
administrative
proceedings
insofar
as
the
determination
under
the
oklahoma
merit
act,
that
if
the
charges
are
valid
then
they
will
be
discharged
from
their
jobs.
in
addition,
under
the
particular
act,
if
they
are
discharged,
criminal
actions
in
the
nature
of
misdemeanor
can
also
be
brought
against
them.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
the
proceedings
that
were
pending
were
an
action
by
the
state
personnel
board
and
in
effect
have
the
corporation
commission
show
cause
why
these
employees
and
these
employees
should
not
be
dismissed
from
their
jobs.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
by
state
personnel
board,
before
the
state
personnel
board.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
is
right.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
sir
because
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
sir.
in
this
particular
instance,
we
feel
that
under
the
–
well,
this
question
was
not
the
one
that
an
issue
raised
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
agreed
by
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no
sir.
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
it
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
if
it
was,
it
was
agreed
to
that
at
the
--
that
question
as
to
whether
or
not
1983
was
appropriate
was
not
raised
in
the
district
court.
the
case
is
up
here
on
the
question
involved
in
the
curtail
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir,
it
did.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
would
assume
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
pardon.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
you
have.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
we
have
not
--
i
think
insofar
as
the
state
personnel
board
is
concerned.
if
you
are
talking
about
oklahoma,
mr.
justice
i
think
this
maybe
the
first
case
that
the
state
personnel
board
has
brought
under
the
so-called
political
prohibition
sections.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
sir,
we
have
had
two
decisions
involving
oklahoma
merit
act
and
these
simply
were
questions
raised
as
of
the
validity
of
merit
act
and
essentially
whether
or
not
they
could
delegate
certain
rule
making
functions
to
the
state
personnel
board.
but
insofar
as
the
question
of
first
amendment
rights
and
the
particular
section
818
which
is
before
this
court,
there
have
not
been
any
substantive
rules.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
and
over-breadth,
both
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir,
we
have
not,
your
honor.
i
thought,
that
i
had
used
the
phrase
vagueness
and
over-breadth,
and
i
specifically
direct
your
attention
to,
if
i
may
and
i
think
would
the
court,
if
i
can
read
these
two
short
provisions
that
are
involved,
the
sections
that
we
are
actually
complained
of
i
think
and
i
can
point
out
the
problem.
some
unnumbered
paragraph
six
states,
“no
employee
in
the
classified
service
and
no
member
of
the
personnel
board
shall
directly
or
indirectly
solicit,
receive
or
in
any
manner
the
concerned
and
soliciting
or
receiving
any
assessment,
subscription
or
contribution
for
any
political
organization,
candidacy
or
other
political
purpose
and
no
state
officer
or
state
employee
in
an
unclassified
service
shall
solicit
or
receive
any
such
assessment,
subscription
or
contribution
from
an
employee
in
the
classified
service.”
next,
unnumbered
paragraph
seven,
“no
employee
in
a
classified
service
shall
be
a
member
of
any
national
state
or
local
committee
of
a
political
party
or
an
officer
or
member
of
a
committee
of
a
partisan
political
club
or
a
candidate
for
nomination
or
election
to
any
paid
public
office
or
shall
take
part
in
the
management
or
affairs
of
any
political
party
or
in
any
political
campaign
except
to
exercise
his
right
as
a
citizen,
privately
to
express
his
opinion
and
cast
his
vote.”
i
respectfully
suggest
sir,
that
you
could
not
hardly
get
more
vague
than
the
use
of
a
phrase
“the
affairs
of
a
political
party.”
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
can
very
honestly
state
to
the
court.
i
think
that
the
court
is
probably
correct
that
insofar
as
the
not
in
any
word
in
the
brief,
in
here
the
brief
that
i
filed
or
the
jurisdictional
statement,
utilized
and
specifically
pointed
out
that
word
of
the
statute.
i
have
used
generalities
in
terms
of
referring
to
the
statutes
being
over-broad
and
vague.
the
vagueness,
i
humbly
submit
to
you
that
by
virtue
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
we
feel
that
it
is
patently
obvious
that
the
political
activity
proscriptions
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
impair
first
amendment
rights
of
oklahoma
state
employees
in
a
classified
service.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
would
have
to
agree
your
honor
that
if
it
is
about
same
language,
it
could
not
be
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
possibility
also.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
insofar
as
the
construction
is
concerned,
the
jurisdictional
statement
has
attached
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
federal
court
and
i
cannot
go
beyond
what
they
state
there
as
to
what
they
did
as
far
as
construing
it.
additionally,
it
is
obvious
that
the
political
activity's
proscription
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
affecting
only
those
state
employees
who
are
in
the
classified
services
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
in
this
regard,
we
would
like
to
request
respectfully
that
the
court
direct
its
attention
to
page
29
of
the
answer
brief,
of
the
attorney
general,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
the
difference
between
classified
and
unclassified
employees
coincides
with
the
classification
of
ministerial
and
policy
forming
officers.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
indicate
the
attorney
general
feels
that
the
policy
forming
officers
are
generally
unclassified.
then,
if
you
go
to
the
merit
act
involved
which
sets
forth
the
unclassified
employees,
i
respectfully
submit
that
these
are
some
of
the
unclassified
employees.

mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no
sir,
i
have
read
it
a
little
different
insofar
as
unclassified
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
would
have
to
agree.
i
can
see
that
that
is
a
policy
making
determination.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
under
the
act,
there
are
certain
designated
agencies
which
are
designated
as
classified,
certain
employees
are
classified,
then
the
governor
may
select
certain
classified
employees.
but,
i
think
as
we
note
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
seeing
the
section
on
unclassified
employees,
there
are
some
22
different,
various
exemptions
under
the
statute
for
unclassified
employees.
now
it's
hard
for
us
to
conceive
how
a
secretary
working
at
the
corporation
commission
as
a
typist
wearing
a
political
button,
endorsing
a
candidate,
how
this
is
relevant
to
some
governmental
purpose
where
she
should
be
deprived
the
bill
of
rights
to
wear
this
button,
as
opposed
to
a
secretary
in
the
attorney
general’s
office.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
would
assume
sir
that
classified
would
connote
some
kind
of
tenure
insofar
as
connection
with
the
oklahoma
merit
act,
some
kind
of
a
repugnance
in
that
regard,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
would
be
a
rationale.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
it
is
an
elected
office.
there
are
three
different
commissioners,
there
is
the
state
corporation
commissioner.
each
elected
every
two
years
and
they
have
a
race
just
like
any
other
race,
there
nominations,
democrats
and
republicans
or
other
parties
and
it
usually
draws
members
and
amount
of
candidates,
and
then
a
party,
a
person
is
elected
to
that
office.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
it
is
a
part
of
the
commissioner's
--
yes.
if
you
say
partisan
in
reference
to
that
they
are
a
democrat
or
a
republican,
i
can't
think
we
are
talking
an
independent
as
then
elected
as
such
a
non-party
member.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
it
is
an
open
race,
sir.
independents
can
run
and
democrats
and,
republicans
can
have
primary.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
six-year
term,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
$19,500
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir,
chairman.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
the
corporation
races
off
as
rather
broad
and
extensive
functions,
generally
regulating
public
utilities
as
such
and
next
regulating
versatile
companies
and
what
we
refer
to
as
the
area
of
oil
and
gas
conservation
and
related
matters,
transportation.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
they
are
very
similar.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
if
i
did,
i
am
sorry
if
i
mislead
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
the
hatch
act
does
recognize
certain
political
activity
which
they
recognize
that
employees
could
engage
in.
in
other
words,
there
isn't
affirmative
provisions
in
the
hatch
act
if
it
is
non-partisan
political
activities.
there
is
no
such
language
in
the
oklahoma
statute.
there
is
no
recognition
of
any
kind
of
activity,
political
activity
that
you
can
engage
in
other
than
if
you
would
consider
the
right
to
vote,
and
to
privately
hold
an
opinion,
as
being
a
political
activity
that
you
engage
in.
in
this
respect,
we're
saying
that
the
oklahoma
is
more
restrictive.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no
sir.
i
think
recently
the
attorney
general
who
is
in
this
case
actually
referring
not
for
its
party
success,
there
was
a
candidate
involved
in
the
city
election,
which
was
non-partisan,
where
an
activity
was
taken
part
as
i
understand
by
a
corporation
commission
employee
and
charges
were
filed,
being
violative
of
the
political
prohibition
section
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act.
that
seems
to
negate
that
determination
in
the
federal
court's
finding
number
nine.
at
least,
the
state
personnel
board
did
not
feel
that,
that
would
be
a
prohibition
against
them
bringing
charges
against
an
employee
perhaps
indicated
a
preference
for
a
candidate
that
was
running
for
a
city
office,
not
on
a
partisan
political
basis.
the
attorney
general
throughout
his
brief
and
first
that
the
object
and/or
aim
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
were
directed
at
the
evils
of
partisan
politics,
equating
part
and
partisan
politics
with
evil.
now,
the
appellants
in
this
case
strongly
dissent
to
that
type
of
a
conclusion.
the
evils
the
act
were
directed
against
were
the
coercion,
intimidation
and
misuse
of
authority
which
might
exploit
the
employees
by
governmental
superiors.
we
respectfully
suggest
the
act
was
not
directed
against
the
voluntary
participation
and
partisan
political
activity
by
a
classified
state
employee.
in
this
regard,
we
point
out
that
the
purposed
clause
of
the
merit
act
simply
sets
forth
what
you
would
expect
a
purpose
clause
to
provide
all
citizens
a
fair
and
equal
opportunity
for
public
service,
to
establish
conditions
and
service
which
will
attract
officers
and
employees
of
character
and
ability.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
have
to
agree
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
i
have
to
agree
with
you,
yes
sir.
that
will
certainly
and
undoubtedly
has
been
in
mind
of
many
legislators
insofar
as
enacting
provisions.
but,
what
we
are
saying
in
this
case
very
simply
is
that
there
is
a
suggestion
for
what
can
you
do
to
striking
this
particular
provision,
political
prohibition
provisions.
that
is
a
rather
drastic
step.
isn't
there
an
easier
way?
wouldn't
it
be
difficult
to
drop
the
statute?
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
draft
the
statute
but
you
could
have
drafted
a
statute
where
you
positively
set
forth
what
particular
political
activities
could
be
enjoyed
by
all
employees
as
opposed
to
proscribing
in
“blanket
prohibitions”
those
acts
which
they
cannot
do.
this
seems
as
a
possibility
as
an
answer.
i
suggest
that
it
appears
to
me
with
the
vast
number
of
state
employees
that
we
have
throughout
both
in
oklahoma
and
throughout
the
country.
that
they
ought
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
voluntarily
exercise
political
expression.
i
think,
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
foundation
of
our
system
of
government.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
think
the
putting
on
a
button
is
an
expression
of
political
opinion.
i
would
say
that,
that's
more
closely
connote
a
private
expression
of
political
opinion
as
opposed
to
being
an
act
that
should
be
curtailed.
the
state
personnel
board
has
enacted
a
particular
provision
interpreting
the
political
prohibition
section
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act,
where
they
say
that
is
partisan
political
activity.
bumper
stickers
are
also
political
activities.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
sir,
if
they
can
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
need
to
do
that,
if
there
is
some
legitimate
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
think
it
possibly
could
be
under
your
hypothetical
where
you
said
during
office
hours,
but
you
see
the
prohibition
is
included
in
the
oklahoma
statute
are
not
restricted
to
during
office
hours.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
they
haven't
been
construed
by
the
only
other
--
which
is
the
state
personnel
board
and
which
is
adapted
rules,
they
have
not
put
such
a
restriction
in
there.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
if
they
determine
that
there
was
actually
something
that
pervasive
about
it,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
assumed
your
honor
correctly
or
incorrectly
that
taking
your
presumption
with
that
determination
that
it
was
divisive.
no,
i
personally
do
not
find
that,
that
is
divisive.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
my
personal
opinion
insofar
as
the
position
of
our
case
is
sir
that,
that
is
going
too
far.
i
think
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
even
during
office
hours,
i
think
the
fact
that
you
have
a
car
sitting
out
in
your
parking
lot
with
a
bumper
sticker
on
it
that
“i
am
for
x”
and
you
will
say
well
that
car
is
sticking
out
in
that
parking
lot
with
that
bumper
sticker
on
it,
that
is
so
divisive
that
we're
going
to
prohibit
that.
i
think
the
extension
of
the
curtailment
of
that
activity
is
going
too
far.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no
sir,
i
think
the
federal
court
has
a
duty
of
looking
what
the
state
legislatures
are
trying
to
accomplish
and
at
the
same
time,
weighing
those
rights
against
the
first
amendment
rights
which
this
court
has
so
zealously
protected
and
saying
there
are
going
to
be
times,
and
there
are
going
to
be
situations
where
we
should
establish
guidelines
of
what
should
be
permissible
and
should
not
be
permissible
insofar
as
the
impairment
of
those
rights,
and
that
is
where
i
think
we
are
here
at
this
time.
in
conclusion,
appellants
pray
this
court,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
with
instructions
to
enter
an
order
and
enjoining
appellees
from
preceding
further
in
a
dismissal
action
against
the
named
appellants.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
very
reasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
i
will
agree
with
you
again.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
we
do
not
contest
the
purpose
and
the
aim
and
the
object.
what
we
are
saying
is
how
was
it
accomplished,
what
we
are
saying
in
the
particular
statutes
that
are
involved,
they
are
too
broad
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
what
i
am
saying
sir
with
regard
to
the
statute
that
is
involved
is
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
was
aimed
that
the
statute
itself
and
so
far
as
it
is
over-breadth
and
vague
where
these
are
concerned.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
if
we
are
to
assume
that
we
are
talking
about
subscriptions
and
receipt
of
money
there,
i
would
say
that
you
have
to
agree.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
and
so
far
as
the
charges
if
the
court
please
now,
these
are
charges
where
we
are
a
long
way
or
insofar
as
having
action
on
those
charges,
these
are
the
allegations
that
they
made
against
the
employees.
i
do
not
want
the
court
to
feel
by
virtue
as
argument
in
the
case
that
we
have
not
admitted
at
all
that
there
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
most
certainly,
we
think
that,
that
type
of
conduct
is
what
was
obviously
aimed
at
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
with
insofar
as
any
kind
of
proscription
of
these
rights.
but
what
we
are
saying
is,
let
us
not
take
all
the
rights
that
they
have
a
way
with
regard
to
political
expression.
a
statute
could
be
enacted
and
could
be
drafted,
we
will
say
from
the
positive
point
of
view,
permitting
them
to
engage
in
certain
partisan
political
activity
on
a
voluntary
basis
which
would
give
them
an
exercise
of
those
rights
guaranteed
to
them
under
the
first
amendment,
we
are
saying.
under
our
statute,
they
have
not
granted
these
rights.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
court
decision,
denying
appellants'
civil
class
action
for
injunctive
relief
to
enjoin
the
deprivation
of
the
civil
rights
of
the
appellants
and
all
classified
employees
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
appellees
with
state
personnel
board,
initiated
proceedings
against
the
appellants
seeking
to
dismiss
said
appellants
from
employment
by
the
state
corporation
commission
for
alleged
political
activities
under
title
74
going
to
statute
--
section
818.
this
action
by
the
state
personnel
board
precipitated
the
filing
of
the
suit
in
federal
court.
the
questions
presented
on
this
appeal
maybe
briefly
stated
as
follows.
may
a
state
by
statute
proscribe
in
broad
and
general
terms
first
amendment
rights
of
state
employees
and
two,
may
a
state
constitutionally
classify
the
employees
of
some,
but
not
all
of
the
state
agencies
and
broadly
prohibit
the
employees
of
those
agencies
from
enjoying
first
amendment
rights
while
permitting
the
unclassified
employees
of
the
state,
all
other
public
employees
and
the
citizenry
at
large
to
freely
enjoy
the
same.
now
we
urge
to
this
honorable
court,
that
such
proscriptions
by
a
state
statute
are
wanting
in
constitutional
acceptability
are
of
the
first,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
if
the
political
activities
prohibition
provisions
of
the
hatch
act
in
the
previous
case
are
found
to
be
subject
to
successful
challenges
as
being
vague
and
overbroad,
a
fortiori
the
political
activities
prohibition
provision
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
should
be
determined
as
constitutionally
warranted.
if
however,
the
political
activities
prohibition
provisions
of
the
hatch
act
are
found
to
be
constitutionally
sound,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
political
activities
or
proscriptions
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
are
constitutionally
well
found
as
said
proscriptions
are
inherently
distinguishable
from
the
pertinent
portions
of
federal
hatch
act.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
would
suggest
the
hatch
act
is
more
lenient.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
there
were,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
we
feel
in
this
particular
instance
because
facially
the
statutes
involved
which
predicated
the
action
against
the
state
employees
are
both
so
vague
and
broad
as
to
permit
the
federal
courts
under
1983,
because
the
civil
rights
in
question
involved
to
rules
specifically
on
that
statute.
abstention
to
make
all
additional
employees
who
may
have
conducted,
the
state
personnel
board
feel
should
warrant
some
kind
of
action,
prosecutory
action
under
these
two
sections
we
feel
it
is
untenable
when
you
read
the
two
statutes.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
we
feel
in
our
particular
case,
in
this
particular
statute,
as
you
know
in
the
hatch
act
and
further
acts,
there
are
some
proscribed
permitted
activities,
political
activities
perhaps
non
partisan
activities.
the
oklahoma
statute
does
not
describe
any
permitted
political
activities
of
any
kind
other
than
a
private
expression
and
the
right
to
vote
with
the
use
of
such
terms
as
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
they
are
administrative
proceedings
insofar
as
the
determination
under
the
oklahoma
merit
act,
that
if
the
charges
are
valid
then
they
will
be
discharged
from
their
jobs.
in
addition,
under
the
particular
act,
if
they
are
discharged,
criminal
actions
in
the
nature
of
misdemeanor
can
also
be
brought
against
them.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
the
proceedings
that
were
pending
were
an
action
by
the
state
personnel
board
and
in
effect
have
the
corporation
commission
show
cause
why
these
employees
and
these
employees
should
not
be
dismissed
from
their
jobs.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
by
state
personnel
board,
before
the
state
personnel
board.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
is
right.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
sir
because
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
sir.
in
this
particular
instance,
we
feel
that
under
the
–
well,
this
question
was
not
the
one
that
an
issue
raised
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
agreed
by
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no
sir.
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
it
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
if
it
was,
it
was
agreed
to
that
at
the
--
that
question
as
to
whether
or
not
1983
was
appropriate
was
not
raised
in
the
district
court.
the
case
is
up
here
on
the
question
involved
in
the
curtail
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir,
it
did.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
would
assume
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
pardon.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
you
have.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
we
have
not
--
i
think
insofar
as
the
state
personnel
board
is
concerned.
if
you
are
talking
about
oklahoma,
mr.
justice
i
think
this
maybe
the
first
case
that
the
state
personnel
board
has
brought
under
the
so-called
political
prohibition
sections.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
sir,
we
have
had
two
decisions
involving
oklahoma
merit
act
and
these
simply
were
questions
raised
as
of
the
validity
of
merit
act
and
essentially
whether
or
not
they
could
delegate
certain
rule
making
functions
to
the
state
personnel
board.
but
insofar
as
the
question
of
first
amendment
rights
and
the
particular
section
818
which
is
before
this
court,
there
have
not
been
any
substantive
rules.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
and
over-breadth,
both
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir,
we
have
not,
your
honor.
i
thought,
that
i
had
used
the
phrase
vagueness
and
over-breadth,
and
i
specifically
direct
your
attention
to,
if
i
may
and
i
think
would
the
court,
if
i
can
read
these
two
short
provisions
that
are
involved,
the
sections
that
we
are
actually
complained
of
i
think
and
i
can
point
out
the
problem.
some
unnumbered
paragraph
six
states,
“no
employee
in
the
classified
service
and
no
member
of
the
personnel
board
shall
directly
or
indirectly

receive
or
in
any
manner
the
concerned
and
soliciting
or
receiving
any
assessment,
subscription
or
contribution
for
any
political
organization,
candidacy
or
other
political
purpose
and
no
state
officer
or
state
employee
in
an
unclassified
service
shall
solicit
or
receive
any
such
assessment,
subscription
or
contribution
from
an
employee
in
the
classified
service.”
next,
unnumbered
paragraph
seven,
“no
employee
in
a
classified
service
shall
be
a
member
of
any
national
state
or
local
committee
of
a
political
party
or
an
officer
or
member
of
a
committee
of
a
partisan
political
club
or
a
candidate
for
nomination
or
election
to
any
paid
public
office
or
shall
take
part
in
the

or

of

or
in
any
political
campaign
except
to
exercise
his
right
as
a
citizen,
privately
to
express
his
opinion
and
cast
his
vote.”
i
respectfully
suggest
sir,
that
you
could
not
hardly
get
more
vague
than
the
use
of
a
phrase
“the
affairs
of
a
political
party.”
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
can
very
honestly
state
to
the
court.
i
think
that
the
court
is
probably
correct
that
insofar
as
the
not
in
any
word
in
the
brief,
in
here
the
brief
that
i
filed
or
the
jurisdictional
statement,
utilized
and
specifically
pointed
out
that
word
of
the
statute.
i
have
used
generalities
in
terms
of
referring
to
the
statutes
being
over-broad
and
vague.
the
vagueness,
i
humbly
submit
to
you
that
by
virtue
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
we
feel
that
it
is
patently
obvious
that
the
political
activity
proscriptions
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
impair
first
amendment
rights
of
oklahoma
state
employees
in
a
classified
service.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
would
have
to
agree
your
honor
that
if
it
is
about
same
language,
it
could
not
be
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
possibility
also.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
insofar
as
the
construction
is
concerned,
the
jurisdictional
statement
has
attached
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
federal
court
and
i
cannot
go
beyond
what
they
state
there
as
to
what
they
did
as
far
as
construing
it.
additionally,
it
is
obvious
that
the
political
activity's
proscription
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
affecting
only
those
state
employees
who
are
in
the
classified
services
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
in
this
regard,
we
would
like
to
request
respectfully
that
the
court
direct
its
attention
to
page
29
of
the
answer
brief,
of
the
attorney
general,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
the
difference
between
classified
and
unclassified
employees
coincides
with
the
classification
of
ministerial
and
policy
forming
officers.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
indicate
the
attorney
general
feels
that
the
policy
forming
officers
are
generally
unclassified.
then,
if
you
go
to
the
merit
act
involved
which
sets
forth
the
unclassified
employees,
i
respectfully
submit
that
these
are
some
of
the
unclassified
employees.

no

i
have
read
it
a
little
different
insofar
as

mr.

i
would
have
to
agree.

there
are
certain
designated
agencies
which
are
designated
as
classified,
certain
employees
are
classified,
then
the
governor
may
select
certain
classified
employees.
but,
i
think
as
we
note
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
seeing
the
section
on
unclassified
employees,
there
are
some
22
different,
various
exemptions
under
the
statute
for
unclassified
employees.
now
it's
hard
for
us
to
conceive
how
a
secretary
working
at
the
corporation
commission
as
a
typist
wearing
a
political
button,
endorsing
a
candidate,
how
this
is
relevant
to
some
governmental
purpose
where
she
should
be
deprived
the
bill
of
rights
to
wear
this
button,
as
opposed
to
a
secretary
in
the
attorney
general’s
office.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
would
assume
sir
that
classified
would
connote
some
kind
of
tenure
insofar
as
connection
with
the
oklahoma
merit
act,
some
kind
of
a
repugnance
in
that
regard,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
would
be
a
rationale.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
it
is
an
elected
office.
there
are
three
different
commissioners,
there
is
the
state
corporation
commissioner.
each
elected
every
two
years
and
they
have
a
race
just
like
any
other
race,
there
nominations,
democrats
and
republicans
or
other
parties
and
it
usually
draws
members
and
amount
of
candidates,
and
then
a
party,
a
person
is
elected
to
that
office.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
it
is
a
part
of
the
commissioner's
--
yes.
if
you
say
partisan
in
reference
to
that
they
are
a
democrat
or
a
republican,
i
can't
think
we
are
talking
an
independent
as
then
elected
as
such
a
non-party
member.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
it
is
an
open
race,
sir.
independents
can
run
and
democrats
and,
republicans
can
have
primary.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
six-year
term,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
$19,500
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir,
chairman.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
the
corporation
races
off
as
rather
broad
and
extensive
functions,
generally
regulating
public
utilities
as
such
and
next
regulating
versatile
companies
and
what
we
refer
to
as
the
area
of
oil
and
gas
conservation
and
related
matters,
transportation.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
they
are
very
similar.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no,
sir.
if
i
did,
i
am
sorry
if
i
mislead
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
the
hatch
act
does
recognize
certain
political
activity
which
they
recognize
that
employees
could
engage
in.
in
other
words,
there
isn't
affirmative
provisions
in
the
hatch
act
if
it
is
non-partisan
political
activities.
there
is
no
such
language
in
the
oklahoma
statute.
there
is
no
recognition
of
any
kind
of
activity,
political
activity
that
you
can
engage
in
other
than
if
you
would
consider
the
right
to
vote,
and
to
privately
hold
an
opinion,
as
being
a
political
activity
that
you
engage
in.
in
this
respect,
we're
saying
that
the
oklahoma
is
more
restrictive.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no
sir.
i
think
recently
the
attorney
general
who
is
in
this
case
actually
referring
not
for
its
party
success,
there
was
a
candidate
involved
in
the
city
election,
which
was
non-partisan,
where
an
activity
was
taken
part
as
i
understand
by
a
corporation
commission
employee
and
charges
were
filed,
being
violative
of
the
political
prohibition
section
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act.
that
seems
to
negate
that
determination
in
the
federal
court's
finding
number
nine.
at
least,
the
state
personnel
board
did
not
feel
that,
that
would
be
a
prohibition
against
them
bringing
charges
against
an
employee
perhaps
indicated
a
preference
for
a
candidate
that
was
running
for
a
city
office,
not
on
a
partisan
political
basis.
the
attorney
general
throughout
his
brief
and
first
that
the
object
and/or
aim
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act
were
directed
at
the
evils
of
partisan
politics,
equating
part
and
partisan
politics
with
evil.
now,
the
appellants
in
this
case
strongly
dissent
to
that
type
of
a
conclusion.
the
evils
the
act
were
directed
against
were
the
coercion,
intimidation
and
misuse
of
authority
which
might
exploit
the
employees
by
governmental
superiors.
we
respectfully
suggest
the
act
was
not
directed
against
the
voluntary
participation
and
partisan
political
activity
by
a
classified
state
employee.
in
this
regard,
we
point
out
that
the
purposed
clause
of
the
merit
act
simply
sets
forth
what
you
would
expect
a
purpose
clause
to
provide
all
citizens
a
fair
and
equal
opportunity
for
public
service,
to
establish
conditions
and
service
which
will
attract
officers
and
employees
of
character
and
ability.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
have
to
agree
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
sir.
i
have
to
agree
with
you,
yes
sir.
that
will
certainly
and
undoubtedly
has
been
in
mind
of
many
legislators
insofar
as
enacting
provisions.
but,
what
we
are
saying
in
this
case
very
simply
is
that
there
is
a
suggestion
for
what
can
you
do
to
striking
this
particular
provision,
political
prohibition
provisions.
that
is
a
rather
drastic
step.
isn't
there
an
easier
way?
wouldn't
it
be
difficult
to
drop
the
statute?
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
draft
the
statute
but
you
could
have
drafted
a
statute
where
you
positively
set
forth
what
particular
political
activities
could
be
enjoyed
by
all
employees
as
opposed
to
proscribing
in
“blanket
prohibitions”
those
acts
which
they
cannot
do.
this
seems
as
a
possibility
as
an
answer.
i
suggest
that
it
appears
to
me
with
the
vast
number
of
state
employees
that
we
have
throughout
both
in
oklahoma
and
throughout
the
country.
that
they
ought
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
voluntarily
exercise
political
expression.
i
think,
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
foundation
of
our
system
of
government.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
think
the
putting
on
a
button
is
an
expression
of
political
opinion.
i
would
say
that,
that's
more
closely
connote
a
private
expression
of
political
opinion
as
opposed
to
being
an
act
that
should
be
curtailed.
the
state
personnel
board
has
enacted
a
particular
provision
interpreting
the
political
prohibition
section
of
the
oklahoma
merit
act,
where
they
say
that
is
partisan
political
activity.
bumper
stickers
are
also
political
activities.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
sir,
if
they
can
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
need
to
do
that,
if
there
is
some
legitimate
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
i
think
it
possibly
could
be
under
your
hypothetical
where
you
said
during
office
hours,
but
you
see
the
prohibition
is
included
in
the
oklahoma
statute
are
not
restricted
to
during
office
hours.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
they
haven't
been
construed
by
the
only
other
--
which
is
the
state
personnel
board
and
which
is
adapted
rules,
they
have
not
put
such
a
restriction
in
there.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
if
they
determine
that
there
was
actually
something
that
pervasive
about
it,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
i
assumed
your
honor
correctly
or
incorrectly
that
taking
your
presumption
with
that
determination
that
it
was
divisive.
no,
i
personally
do
not
find
that,
that
is
divisive.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
my
personal
opinion
insofar
as
the
position
of
our
case
is
sir
that,
that
is
going
too
far.
i
think
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
even
during
office
hours,
i
think
the
fact
that
you
have
a
car
sitting
out
in
your
parking
lot
with
a
bumper
sticker
on
it
that
“i
am
for
x”
and
you
will
say
well
that
car
is
sticking
out
in
that
parking
lot
with
that
bumper
sticker
on
it,
that
is
so
divisive
that
we're
going
to
prohibit
that.
i
think
the
extension
of
the
curtailment
of
that
activity
is
going
too
far.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
no
sir,
i
think
the
federal
court
has
a
duty
of
looking
what
the
state
legislatures
are
trying
to
accomplish
and
at
the
same
time,
weighing
those
rights
against
the
first
amendment
rights
which
this
court
has
so
zealously
protected
and
saying
there
are
going
to
be
times,
and
there
are
going
to
be
situations
where
we
should
establish
guidelines
of
what
should
be
permissible
and
should
not
be
permissible
insofar
as
the
impairment
of
those
rights,
and
that
is
where
i
think
we
are
here
at
this
time.
in
conclusion,
appellants
pray
this
court,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
with
instructions
to
enter
an
order
and
enjoining
appellees
from
preceding
further
in
a
dismissal
action
against
the
named
appellants.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
very
reasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
i
will
agree
with
you
again.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
we
do
not
contest
the
purpose
and
the
aim
and
the
object.
what
we
are
saying
is
how
was
it
accomplished,
what
we
are
saying
in
the
particular
statutes
that
are
involved,
they
are
too
broad
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
what
i
am
saying
sir
with
regard
to
the
statute
that
is
involved
is
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
was
aimed
that
the
statute
itself
and
so
far
as
it
is
over-breadth
and
vague
where
these
are
concerned.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
well,
if
we
are
to
assume
that
we
are
talking
about
subscriptions
and
receipt
of
money
there,
i
would
say
that
you
have
to
agree.
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes,
and
so
far
as
the
charges
if
the
court
please
now,
these
are
charges
where
we
are
a
long
way
or
insofar
as
having
action
on
those
charges,
these
are
the
allegations
that
they
made
against
the
employees.
i
do
not
want
the
court
to
feel
by
virtue
as
argument
in
the
case
that
we
have
not
admitted
at
all
that
there
--
mr.
john
c.
buckingham
yes
sir.
most
certainly,
we
think
that,
that
type
of
conduct
is
what
was
obviously
aimed
at
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
with
insofar
as
any
kind
of
proscription
of
these
rights.
but
what
we
are
saying
is,
let
us
not
take
all
the
rights
that
they
have
a
way
with
regard
to
political
expression.
a
statute
could
be
enacted
and
could
be
drafted,
we
will
say
from
the
positive
point
of
view,
permitting
them
to
engage
in
certain
partisan
political
activity
on
a
voluntary
basis
which
would
give
them
an
exercise
of
those
rights
guaranteed
to
them
under
the
first
amendment,
we
are
saying.
under
our
statute,
they
have
not
granted
these
rights.
