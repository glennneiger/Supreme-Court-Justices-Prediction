justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
younger
against
harris
involved
a
claim
of
over
facial,
over-breadth
too,
didn't
it?
isn't
really
the
only
distinction
between
that
and
this
and
that
this
is
civil
and
that
was
criminal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
three-judge
district
court
before
whom
your
case
went
in
oklahoma
have
to
construe
the
statute
in
order
to
reach
the
determination
that
it
did?
it
is
hard
to
tell
from
their
opinion
i
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
term
classified
in
your
statute
connote
job
tenure
of
some
sort?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
what
the
legislature
has
basically
done
it
is
saying
that
employees
who
have
that
kind
of
tenure
are
barred
from
this
type
of
political
activities
and
employees
who
do
not
have
that
kind
of
tenure,
aren't
barred.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

there
any
practice
in
your
state
as
there
was
in
arizona
where
i
came
from,
where
a
private
citizen
wanted
an
attorney
general’s
opinion,
he
would
ask
his
legislator
who
would
in
turn
ask
the
attorney
general?
