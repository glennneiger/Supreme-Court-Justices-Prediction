i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
would
consider
the
oklahoma

more
restrictive
than
the
federal
act?

(inaudible)
judge
of
court
in
paragraph
nine,
conclusions
of
law,
there
is
an
interpretation
of
your
act
to
the
effect
that
it
does
not
restrict
public
and
private
expressions
on
public
affairs
and
personalities,
so
long
as
employee
does
not
channel
his
activity
to
a
party's
success.
assuming
for
the
moment
that
it
could
not
have
authority
to
interpret
oklahoma
law,
would
you
accept
that
final
interpretation?
justice

mr.
martin,
i
understand
it
is
agreed
that
the
personnel
board
has
the
authority
to
promulgate
regulations.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
appendix,
you
have
as
i
read
it
only
one
regulation,
that
1641
that
deals
with
the
substance
of
the
issue
here
today.
does
this
mean
that
council
in
agreement
that
no
other
regulation
is
relevant
to
this
case?
