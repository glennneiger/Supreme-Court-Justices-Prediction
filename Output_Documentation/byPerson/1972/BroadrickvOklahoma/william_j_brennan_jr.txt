justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
not
take
but
the
disciplinary
proceedings
that
were
pending,
whether
they
are
administrative
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
am
not
clear
about
is,
what
proceedings
were
pending
when
this
action
was
brought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
brought
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
i
say.
it
was
pending
then
before
an
agency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
no
court
proceeding
pending?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
gather
that
if
this
is
1983
suit,
your
thought
would
be
that
there
is
no
requirement
in
actions
under
that
section,
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
brought
it
under
1983,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
your
jurisdictional
ground
in
1983?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
haven't
we
in
many
cases
held
that
in
actions
under
1983,
there
is
no
requirement
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
isn't
that
your
answer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
suppose
your
state
courts
might
give
those
words
a
different
reach
than
where
the
federal
court
gives
the
reach
of
the
federal
statute,
does
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
identity
or
work
something
that
might
do
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
what
you
said
earlier,
you
are
not
unhappy
it
hasn't
been
asked?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
are
--
you
don't
object
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
there
be
a
state
court
proceeding
under
that
stay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
oklahoma
have
declaratory
judgment
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
there
be
anyway
any
of
these
effected
people
could
go
to
the
oklahoma
courts
without
having
first
to
go
through
all
of
the
administrative
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
the
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
waiting
the
outcome
of
the
administrative
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
general
ruling
in
your
state,
are
those
published
and
are
they
available?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
not
cited
in
your
brief,
but
i
think
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
