chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-1639,
broadrick
against
oklahoma.
mr.
buckingham,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
of
your
questions
presented
perhaps
can
we
can
get
at
more
specifically?
which
of
the
questions
presented
as
you
read
them,
do
you
think
presents
that
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
number
three
is
almost
precisely
the
language
of
the
hatch
act,
is
it
not
or
at
least
its
thrust
is
precisely
the
same,
management
or
affairs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
in
that
sense,
you
do
not
think
it
is
either
more
broad
or
less
broad
than
preceding
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
impact
of
this
is
as
reading
the
statute
as
that
the
people
on
the
very
top
and
the
people
on
the
very
bottom
are
not
covered
for
totally
different
reasons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
wouldn't
exclude
the
part-time
farm
laborer
for
policy
reasons
which
is
kind
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
you
might
want
to
cover
the
man
who
is
head
of
the
agriculture
department
as
a
policy
maker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
is
whether
they
have
done
that
as
precisely
as
they
should?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
isn't
that
other
factors
a
legislature
takes
into
account
that
is
that
they
do
not
want
to
put
a
premium
on
having
a
man
enlarge
his
staff
for
any
particular
departments
in
order
to
have
that
many
more
people
to
work
on
political
activities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean,
that
is
a
legitimate
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
do
seem
to
place
some
emphasis
and
i
am
not
sure
in
what
respect
on
people
wearing
a
button
and
saying
i
am
for
this
man
or
that
man.
now
do
you
think
that
is
a
first
amendment
right
which
the
legislature
cannot
prohibit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
let
us
just
take
that
in
the
office
now,
wearing
a
button,
“i
am
for
governor
jones'
reelection
or
what
not”
or,
“i
am
for
the
other
man.”
do
you
say
a
legislature
is
constitutionally
barred
from
saying
that,
that
kind
of
display
during
working
hours
in
the
office
has
a
tendency
to
provoke
disputes
and
arguments
and
evasiveness
and
disputation
among
the
employees
to
the
disparagement
of
their
work
and
their
duties.
you
say
the
legislature
cannot
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
i
have
stated
all
the
need,
now
do
you
say
that
need
as
i
have
outlined
it,
is
not
a
legitimate
state
interest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
might
be
construed
that
way
by
the
state
courts
in
a
particular
case,
might
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
concede
that
it
would
be
a
valid
exercise
of
judicial
power
for
the
courts
of
oklahoma
to
say
that's
valid
as
a
limitation
during
office
hours
and
in
the
building
where
you
work,
but
it
is
invalid
outside
of
office
hours
and
outside
of
the
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
thought
you
conceded
that
during
office
hours,
this
would
be
divisive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
--
but
do
you
think,
independent
of
your
view
of
it,
do
you
think
a
legislature
is
constitutionally
barred
from
thinking
that
it
is
divisive
and
legislating
on
that
assumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
during
office
hours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
federal
court
has
the
power,
has
the
duty
constitutionally
to
say
that
the
legislature
of
oklahoma
cannot
think
otherwise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
martin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
it
mean
that
if
he
is
at
a
party
with
his
friends
at
home,
he
can
express
it
and
if
he
is
out
on
a
platform,
he
can't.
what's
so
difficult
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
a
matter
of
degree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
this
commissioner
who
benefited
by
the
work
presumably
of
these
people
have
asked
the
attorney
general
for
an
opinion
about
these
matters?
is
he
one
of
the
state
officers
who
has
that
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
democratic
candidate
and
a
republican
candidate
would
consider
that
partisan
political
activity
since
it
is
aimed
against
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
they
available
in
some
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
might
be
useful,
will
you
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
buckingham,
i
have
a
question
or
two
if
you
have
the
moment
on.
i
suppose
it
can
be
assumed
or
at
least
let
us
assume
it
anyway,
that
although
there
were
some
employees
who
assisted
this
commissioner
under
whose
general
jurisdiction
they
were,
there
were
these
people
who
helped
him
get
reelected,
there
may
have
been
others
who
did
not
help
him
get
reelected.
that
is
a
reasonable
assumption,
is
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
reasonable
assumption
for
the
legislature
to
think
that
they
want
to
protect
employees
from
being
urged
by
the
commissioner
to
engage
in
political
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
those
who
are
requested
and
declined
might
not
be
so
favorite
if
the
commissioner
got
reelected?
that
is
a
possibility.
i
am
not
suggesting
it
is
a
fact,
it
is
merely
a
possibility
that
the
legislature
might
have
taken
into
account.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
would
tend
to
sustain
the
attorney
general’s
view
that
the
purposes
were
prophylactic
or
to
take
mr.
justice
white’s
term
to
insulate
them
from
this
kind
of
an
influence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
challenging
as
applied
here,
the
people
who
solicited
money,
received
campaign
contributions,
and
transported
campaign
materials?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
anybody
who
is
able
to
read
had
any
doubt
that
this
statute
prohibited
the
kind
of
activity
involved
in
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no
we
are
merely
talking
about
allegation,
but
you
concede
that
these
are
proper
grounds
for
a
state
to
establish
prohibitions,
and
that
if
they
were
found
guilty
of
them,
they
could
properly
be
disciplined.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

e.

we'll
