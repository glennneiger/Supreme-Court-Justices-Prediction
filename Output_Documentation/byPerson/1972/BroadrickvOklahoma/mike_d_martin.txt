mr.
mike
d.
martin
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1947,
this
court
upheld
in
mitchell
case
and
a
companion
case,
oklahoma
versus
civil
service
commission,
you
have
applied
the
federal
hatch
act
prohibitions
to
state
employees
that
are
federally
funded.
the
oklahoma
legislature
1959
in
enacting
the
oklahoma
merit
system
act,
the
personnel
administration,
incorporated
in
that
act,
political
activity
prohibitions
against
classified
employees
of
the
merit
system.
this
act
is
modeled
after
the
federal
hatch
act.
in
fact,
the
act
provides
in
one
of
the
sections
that
the
state
personnel
board
is
required
and
directed
to
alter
any
rules
or
regulations
it
has,
the
conflict
with
standards
or
conditions
of
federal
grants
recognizing
that
the
federally
funded
employees
that
work
for
the
state
are
subject
to
the
prohibitions
of
the
federal
hatch
act.
there
are
some
differences
between
the
federal
hatch
act,
and
our
state
political
activity
prohibitions.
basically,
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
i
believe
that
the
state
took
the
prophylactic
approach
that
was
upheld
in
mitchell
as
a
method
for
proscribing
political
activity
on
behalf
of
state
employees.
in
doing
so,
they
did
not
incorporate
by
reference
any
case
decisions,
as
there
were
none
in
oklahoma.
they
did,
however,
provide
that
the
personnel
board
could
by
rule
enact
rules
and
regulations
to
carry
out
the
effect
and
purposes
of
the
act.
the
state
personnel
board
has
done
so,
and
they
continue
to
enact
rules
and
regulations
regarding
not
only
the
entire
merit
system,
but
the
political
activity
prohibitions.
in
addition,
the
language,
the
facial
language
of
section
818
has
some
differences
which
are
not
contained
in
the
current
federal
hatch
act.
there
are
references
to
privately
expressing
his
opinion
and
casting
his
vote
which
i
believe
has
been
raised
by
my
brother
counselor.
we
would
urge
that
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
your
honor,
i
might
first
state
that
this
prohibition
is
related
only
to
an
employee
who
is
taking
part
in
the
management
or
affairs
of
a
political
party
or
political
campaign,
but
it
is
not
restricted
to
his
voicing
his
opinion
on
matters
of
public
personalities
or
affairs.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
this
is
not
defined
in
the
act.
there
have
been
no
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
what
do
i
think
it
means?
that
is
a
good
question,
your
honor.
i
could
not
answer
that.[laughter]
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
degree,
because
you
can
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
that
is
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
this
is
true
mr.
justice.
this
is
my
point.
you
can
certainly
have
a
fact
situation
where
it
would
be
a
private
expression,
but
you
can
certainly
find
one
where
it
would
be
a
borderline
case.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
there
was
none.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
did.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
there
was
none.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
did.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
the
only
authority
of
interpretation
that
has
been
made,
has
been
made
in
regard
to
attorney
general’s
opinion
that
has
been
issued
over
the
years
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
those.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
that
question
has
not
been
asked.
i
might
add
that
the
state
attorney
general’s
opinions
have
force
and
effect
of
law
until
overturned
by
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
and
state
employees,
and
state
agencies
are
required
to
adhere
to
those
opinions.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
attorney
general’s
opinion
can
be
requested
by
statute,
can
be
requested
by
state
legislature,
an
agency
head,
it
cannot
be
requested
by
a
private
citizen,
no.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
member,
any
member
of
legislature.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
this
is
done
quite
often.
i
think
what
the
issue
is
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no
one
has
asked.
we
cannot
on
our
own
issue
attorney
general’s
opinions.
we
have
to
be
asked
questions
and
this
question
has
not
been
asked.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
i
would
hate
to
have
to
write
it,
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
i
do
not
object.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
i
do.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
the
oklahoma
court
has
never
construed
either
these
two
paragraphs.
i
believe
what
we
have
before
the
bench
today
is
the
issue
of
the
prophylactic
approach
adapted
by
these
political
activity
prohibitions
as
set
forth
in
mitchell.
the
alternatives
to
setting
up
the
prohibitions
in
terms
of
a
vagueness
test
would
amount
to
setting
out
all
types
of
conduct
that
could
possibly
be
prohibited,
a
task
which
would
seemingly
be
impossible.
the
prophylactic
approach
of
mitchell
is
the
current
approach
that
the
state
has
used
and
has
currently
adopted.
another
approach
would
be
perhaps
to
narrow
the
language
of
the
statute
and
set
out
specific
prohibitions
that
would
not
be
as
broad
and
prophylactic.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
is,
justice.
in
the
original
record,
contains
charges
by
letter,
served
by
letter
to
each
individual
specifying
with
particularity
what
conducts
he
was
accused
of
violating
in
terms
of
political
activity
statute.
each
individual
was
charged
alternatively
with
soliciting
campaign
funds,
receiving
campaign
funds,
attempting
to
secure
other
classified
employees
to
work
in
the
campaign,
and
i
believe
there
is
one
charge
of
hauling
campaign
materials.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
was,
justice.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
he
was.
i
might
add
that
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
that
the
personnel
board
issued
a
stay
of
their
proceedings
pending
a
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
these
prohibitions
in
the
federal
courts.
they
were
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
the
state
was
issued
after
a
complaint
had
been
filed
in
federal
court.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
believe
it
is
possible
that
they
could
have
gone
into
federal
court.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
state
court,
and
challenge
the
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
think
the
personnel
board
would
have
issued
a
stay
in
that
situation
also
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
at
the
time
the
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
there
were
specific
charges
that
were
made.
at
the
time
stay
was
granted,
there
were
a
number
of
motions
pending
before
the
board
in
relation
to
those
charged
by
the
attorneys
representing
them.
we
have
not
progressed
to
the
point
of
having
a
hearing,
we
have
been
started
--
and
having
a
hearing.
we
were
still
in
the
discovery
stage.
one
of
the
complaints
filed
in
federal
district
court.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
in
regard
to
the
administrative
hearing,
there
is
a
10
day
provision
for
a
request
for
rehearing
and
the
party
found
has
30
days
in
which
to
appeal
to
state
court
on
the
record.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
also
board
and
the
court
has
the
power
to
stay
any
order
of
the
agency.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
he
goes
into
an
oklahoma
trial
court.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
sir
it
is.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
it
is
on
the
record.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
substantial
evidence.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
he
could
have
asked
for
an
opinion.
i
believe
that
the
vagueness
test
we
have
cited
out
in
grayned
versus
city
of
rockford
is
controlling
in
our
case,
we
notice
that
the
state
employees
have
in
regard
to
the
prohibitions
is
given
not
only
by
the
facial
language
of
the
statute
itself,
but
also
from
rules
and
regulations
set
forth
by
the
personnel
board,
circulars
that
are
issued
by
the
personnel
board
to
each
employee
prescribing
and
setting
forth
what
activities
he
can
be
involved
in,
and
what
activities
he
cannot
be
involved
in.
in
addition,
there
are
attorney
general’s
opinions
which
as
i
indicated
earlier
have
force
and
effect
of
law
and
which
employees
and
agencies
are
required
to
follow.
these
opinions
have
alternatively
down
through
the
years,
interpreted
the
prohibitions
to
be
prohibitions
against
partisan
activity.
the
standards
which
the
personnel
board
has
to
enforce
this
political
activity
prohibition
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
test
and
grant
it.
they
themselves
has
set
forth
rules,
and
they
also
guide
themselves
by
the
federal
hatch
act
prohibitions
through
the
oklahoma
versus
civil
service
commission
case
and
a
provision
in
the
statute
itself
which
requires
them
to
alter
the
rules
and
regulations
which
conflict
with
those
standards
that
apply
to
federal
grants.
so
they
themselves
adhere
to
standards
which
they
set
themselves
and
which
are
set
through
the
federal
hatch
act.
the
employees
themselves
have
access
to
advisory
opinions
from
the
personnel
board
which
is
indicated
to
them
in
a
circular
that
is
distributed.
they
have
access
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
which
further
define
the
prohibition
set
out
in
the
statute,
and
under
certain
conditions
they
can
ask
for
attorney
general’s
opinion
if
they
get
someone
to
ask
who
has
authority
to.
the
broadness
test,
over-breadth
test
that
supplied
to
this
case
particular
in
relation
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
appellants
contend
that
it
prohibits
constitutionally
protected
speech
as
well
as
non-protected.
the
three-judge
panel
correctly
held
that
the
prohibitions
were
against
partisan
political
activity,
and
were
not
over-broad
while
the
specific
language
itself
does
not
with
perhaps
as
certainly
as
appellants
would
like,
connote
that
it
is
only
partisan
political
activity
that
is
prohibited
the
particular
wording
of
the
statute
gives
that
connotation.
in
addition,
the
attorney
general
earlier
in
1968,
in
an
attorney
general’s
opinion
that
those
prohibitions
were
against
partisan
political
activity
only.
the
enforcement
of
those
provisions
by
the
personnel
board
and
the
circulars
that
they
issue
to
state
employees
also
specify
that
they
are
partisan
political
activity
prohibitions.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
i
do
not
really
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
do
not
believe
we
have
had
an
independent
run.
yes,
we
have,
i
will
take
that
back.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
in
last
race.
i
think
if
an
independent
is
running
as
an
independent
and
has
through
his
resources
a
--
i
would
not
say
party
but
a
organization
that
espouses
his
particular
beliefs.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
someone
working
for
that
organization
would
be
very
similar
to
working
for
a
party
and
as
they
are
attempting
to
espouse
to
others,
the
beliefs
of
that
individual
through
his
organization
and
his
platform.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
i
would
think
so,
and
i
would
think
that
the
definition
of
party
politics
is
broadly
that
which
is
aimed
at
instigating
a
state
government
a
particular
belief
or
espousing
a
particular
platform,
which
currently
has
a
two-party
system
but
there
are
independents,
and
other
parties,
actually
american
party
which
--
are
parties
because
they
espouse
a
particular
belief
or
attempt
to
set
forth
particular
policies
in
state
government
which
are
unique
onto
themselves.
so
i
think
in
that
regard,
it
would
be
a
prohibition
against
someone
working
for
an
independent
candidate
via
such
an
organization.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
they
are.
they
are
published.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
they
are
published
and
distributed
to
all
agencies.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
there
are.
there
are
68
opinions
which
interpreted
the
political
activity
prohibitions
until
they
were
partisan
political
activities.
there
have
also
been
other
opinions
down
through
the
years.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
other
citations?
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
have
a
listing
of
some
of
the
opinions
and
what
they
dealt
with.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
we
can
make
them
available
and
then
add
them
to
the
record.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
they
are
published.
they
are
issued
to
the
individual
requesting
the
opinion
and
also
sent
to
state
agencies
to
distribute,
and
to
inform
the
employees.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
do
not
believe
we
are
now
putting
them
in
a
bound
volume
but
i
do
not
believe
in
1968
that
they
were
put
any
bound
volume.
i
believe
that
just
occurred
several
years
ago.
they
just
started
six
years,excuse
me.
yes,
we
do
have
a
bound
volume
i
do
not
know
if
you
have
access
to
it
in
your
library.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
there
are
three
that
are
in
the
record
but
they
are
not
inclusive
of
all
that
were
issued.
there
are
a
number
of
more
that
were
issued.
now,
i
will
make
available
as
part
of
the
record
those
opinions.
of
the
states,
22,000
employees,
approximately
20,000
are
under
the
merit
system
as
classified
employees.
the
prohibition
specifically
apply
only
to
classified
employees.
they
do
apply
to
unclassified
employees
to
the
extent
that
unclassified
employees
cannot
attempt
to
solicit
funds
from
classified
employees,
nor
get
them
involved
in
partisan
politics.
the
distinction
for
the
prohibitions
are
related
to
the
enactment
of
the
merit
system
of
personnel
administration.
when
the
personnel
act
was
put
into
effect
in
1959,
these
prohibitions
were
placed
in
there
and
applied
only
to
classified
employees.
the
rationale
of
the
merit
system
is
to
allow
the
employee
to
progress
in
his
work
free
from
outside
influence
including
politics.
the
decision
to
exempt
certain
agencies
and
employees
from
the
classified
system
was
based
primarily
on
the
decision
that
the
populace
needs
some
state
individuals
to
express
their
will.
in
addition,
the
unclassified
employees
are
not
protected
by
the
merit
system
are
subject
to
the
whims
and
caprices
of
their
employees
so
to
speak.
they
have
no
recourse
in
event
that
they
are
terminated
as
to
the
classified
employees.
not
only
are
specific
individuals
exempted
from
the
merit
system
classification,
but
agencies
as
a
whole
are
also
exempted.
while
the
decision
of
the
legislature
to
allow
the
populace
to
express
their
will
to
certain
individuals
was
expressed
in
the
act.
they
also
felt
that
it
was
necessary
for
entire
agencies
because
of
the
nature
of
their
work
to
also
be
exempted,
and
in
this
regard,
the
application
of
the
prohibitions
is
limitedly
applied
to
them.
we
think
that
this
is
a
valid
distinction
that
under
the
prophylactic
approach
of
mitchell,
the
decision
to
include
some
state
employees
under
the
prohibitions
and
exclude
others
is
a
judgment
that
has
to
be
weighed
by
the
state
and
has
experienced
over
the
years
of
the
political
activity
that
they
are
attempting
to
prohibit.
the
governor
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
can
by
executive
order
place
new
agencies
under
the
merit
system
or
existing
agencies
that
are
not
under
the
merit
system.
so
there
is
a
flexibility
as
time
goes
by
for
the
state
to
continue
to
combat
the
evils
of
partisan
politics
by
placing
those
unclassified
employees
and
agencies
under
the
prohibitions.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
he
has
given
authority
by
the
personnel
act
to
place
agencies
under
the
merit
system,
and
that
authority
does
not
exceed
the
exemptions
that
are
already
placed
in
the
statute
itself.
there
are
certain
statutory
exemptions,
but
as
far
as
newly
created
agencies,
he
has
the
authority
to
place
them
under
the
merit
system
by
executive
order.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
the
obvious
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
merit
system
is
to
insulate
him
from
outside
influence
including
politics.
i
think,
the
prohibitions
apply
only
to
classified
employees.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
the
state
unlike
the
federal
government
did
not
till
1959
make
prohibitions
against
political
activity,
and
during
this
long
period
of
years
since
1907
since
we
have
become
a
state,
it
has
been
apparent
to
the
legislature
that
the
political
activity
control
of
state
employees
was
something
which
was
not
good
for
the
state.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
it
was
to
insulate
the
employees
and
to
prohibit
a
party
from
controlling
the
state
and
making
its
desires
and
wishes
of
the
state
instead
of
having
a
neutral
state
government
which
was
not
controlled
by
a
party.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
is.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
in
a
retirement
system,
he
is
not
subject
to
dismissal
except
for
cause
that
is
under
a
statute.
they
dismiss,
he
has
a
hearing
for
the
personnel
board
and
there
are
specific
prohibitions
against
using
influence
against
him
either
discriminatory
or
favorable
to
effect
his
promotion
or
his
non-promotion.
so
there
are
basic
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
the
employees
will
--
non-classified
employees
also
had
access
to
retirement
system,
but
they
have
no
tenure
in
terms
of
their
dismissal.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
he
has
a
choice
in
terms
of
where
he
applies
to
work.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
i
do.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice.
specifically,
at
the
three-judge
panel
level,
it
was
brought
out
that
this
constitutional
attack
included
only
the
statutory
language
that
the
rules
enacted
by
the
board
were
not
included
in
this
attack,
and
on
that
point
since
we
are
dealing
with
the
facial
and
validation
problem,
the
rules
that
have
been
enacted
by
the
board
in
regard
to
this
area,
were
not
looked
at
or
included
in
terms
of
the
record.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
they
are.
there
is
a
publication
of
the
other
rules
of
the
board
which
are
issued
to
all
the
agencies
and
employees.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
they
are.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
the
personnel
board
even
though
they
had
the
authority
to
enact
rules
and
regulations
to
further
defining
the
prohibitions
in
the
section
818,
they
have
not
extensively
done
so.
the
act
has
only
been
in
effect
14
years.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
we
can
make
those
available
to
the
court
if
they
desire
to
look
at
it.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
i
will.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
they
had
access
to
the
one
that
was
in
the
record,
but
they
did
not
have
access
to
all
of
them
since
the
plaintiffs,
appellants
here
particularly
noted
that
they
were
not
contesting
those
rules
or
regulations,
just
the
statute.
the
conclusion
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
oklahoma
has
taken
the
prophylactic
approach
of
mitchell
and
we
feel
that
this
is
the
only
classical
way
of
combating
the
evil
that
is
sought
to
be
prohibited.
an
inclusive
approach
of
setting
out
all
the
conduct
that
has
to
be
prohibited
by
the
statute
is
impossible,
a
narrowing
construction
of
the
statute
would
not
have
the
effect
of
combating
the
evils
that
are
sought
to
be
prohibited.
now,
the
prophylactic
approach
of
mitchell
is
valid
whether
it
is
based
upon
the
rational
test,
basis
test,
or
the
compelling
governmental
interest
test
with
the
least
alternative
restrictive
test,
and
we
feel
that
the
court
should
sustain
the
over
court's
holding
that
set
prohibitions
are
constitutional.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1947,
this
court
upheld
in
mitchell
case
and
a
companion
case,
oklahoma
versus
civil
service
commission,
you
have
applied
the
federal
hatch
act
prohibitions
to
state
employees
that
are
federally
funded.
the
oklahoma
legislature
1959
in
enacting
the
oklahoma
merit
system
act,
the
personnel
administration,
incorporated
in
that
act,
political
activity
prohibitions
against
classified
employees
of
the
merit
system.
this
act
is
modeled
after
the
federal
hatch
act.
in
fact,
the
act
provides
in
one
of
the
sections
that
the
state
personnel
board
is
required
and
directed
to
alter
any
rules
or
regulations
it
has,
the
conflict
with
standards
or
conditions
of
federal
grants
recognizing
that
the
federally
funded
employees
that
work
for
the
state
are
subject
to
the
prohibitions
of
the
federal
hatch
act.
there
are
some
differences
between
the
federal
hatch
act,
and
our
state
political
activity
prohibitions.
basically,
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
i
believe
that
the
state
took
the
prophylactic
approach
that
was
upheld
in
mitchell
as
a
method
for
proscribing
political
activity
on
behalf
of
state
employees.
in
doing
so,
they
did
not
incorporate
by
reference
any
case
decisions,
as
there
were
none
in
oklahoma.
they
did,
however,
provide
that
the
personnel
board
could
by
rule
enact
rules
and
regulations
to
carry
out
the
effect
and
purposes
of
the
act.
the
state
personnel
board
has
done
so,
and
they
continue
to
enact
rules
and
regulations
regarding
not
only
the
entire
merit
system,
but
the
political
activity
prohibitions.
in
addition,
the
language,
the
facial
language
of
section
818
has
some
differences
which
are
not
contained
in
the
current
federal
hatch
act.
there
are
references
to
privately
expressing
his
opinion
and
casting
his
vote
which
i
believe
has
been
raised
by
my
brother
counselor.
we
would
urge
that
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
your
honor,
i
might
first
state
that
this
prohibition
is
related
only
to
an
employee
who
is
taking
part
in
the
management
or
affairs
of
a
political
party
or
political
campaign,
but
it
is
not
restricted
to
his
voicing
his
opinion
on
matters
of
public
personalities
or
affairs.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
this
is
not
defined
in
the
act.
there
have
been
no
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
what
do
i
think
it
means?
that
is
a
good
question,
your
honor.
i
could
not
answer
that.[laughter]
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
degree,
because
you
can
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
that
is
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
this
is
true
mr.
justice.
this
is
my
point.
you
can
certainly
have
a
fact
situation
where
it
would
be
a
private
expression,
but
you
can
certainly
find
one
where
it
would
be
a
borderline
case.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
there
was
none.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
did.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
there
was
none.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
did.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
the
only
authority
of
interpretation
that
has
been
made,
has
been
made
in
regard
to
attorney
general’s
opinion
that
has
been
issued
over
the
years
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
those.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
that
question
has
not
been
asked.
i
might
add
that
the
state
attorney
general’s
opinions
have
force
and
effect
of
law
until
overturned
by
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
and
state
employees,
and
state
agencies
are
required
to
adhere
to
those
opinions.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
attorney
general’s
opinion
can
be
requested
by
statute,
can
be
requested
by
state
legislature,
an
agency
head,
it
cannot
be
requested
by
a
private
citizen,
no.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
member,
any
member
of
legislature.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
this
is
done
quite
often.
i
think
what
the
issue
is
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no
one
has
asked.
we
cannot
on
our
own
issue
attorney
general’s
opinions.
we
have
to
be
asked
questions
and
this
question
has
not
been
asked.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
i
would
hate
to
have
to
write
it,
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
i
do
not
object.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
i
do.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
the
oklahoma
court
has
never
construed
either
these
two
paragraphs.
i
believe
what
we
have
before
the
bench
today
is
the
issue
of
the
prophylactic
approach
adapted
by
these
political
activity
prohibitions
as
set
forth
in
mitchell.
the
alternatives
to
setting
up
the
prohibitions
in
terms
of
a
vagueness
test
would
amount
to
setting
out
all
types
of
conduct
that
could
possibly
be
prohibited,
a
task
which
would
seemingly
be
impossible.
the
prophylactic
approach
of
mitchell
is
the
current
approach
that
the
state
has
used
and
has
currently
adopted.
another
approach
would
be
perhaps
to
narrow
the
language
of
the
statute
and
set
out
specific
prohibitions
that
would
not
be
as
broad
and
prophylactic.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
is,
justice.
in
the
original
record,
contains
charges
by
letter,
served
by
letter
to
each
individual
specifying
with
particularity
what
conducts
he
was
accused
of
violating
in
terms
of
political
activity
statute.
each
individual
was
charged
alternatively
with
soliciting
campaign
funds,
receiving
campaign
funds,
attempting
to
secure
other
classified
employees
to
work
in
the
campaign,
and
i
believe
there
is
one
charge
of
hauling
campaign
materials.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
was,
justice.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
he
was.
i
might
add
that
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
that
the
personnel
board
issued
a
stay
of
their
proceedings
pending
a
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
these
prohibitions
in
the
federal
courts.
they
were
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
the
state
was
issued
after
a
complaint
had
been
filed
in
federal
court.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
believe
it
is
possible
that
they
could
have
gone
into
federal
court.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
state
court,
and
challenge
the
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
think
the
personnel
board
would
have
issued
a
stay
in
that
situation
also
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
at
the
time
the
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
there
were
specific
charges
that
were
made.
at
the
time
stay
was
granted,
there
were
a
number
of
motions
pending
before
the
board
in
relation
to
those
charged
by
the
attorneys
representing
them.
we
have
not
progressed
to
the
point
of
having
a
hearing,
we
have
been
started
--
and
having
a
hearing.
we
were
still
in
the
discovery
stage.
one
of
the
complaints
filed
in
federal
district
court.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
in
regard
to
the
administrative
hearing,
there
is
a
10
day
provision
for
a
request
for
rehearing
and
the
party
found
has
30
days
in
which
to
appeal
to
state
court
on
the
record.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
also
board
and
the
court
has
the
power
to
stay
any
order
of
the
agency.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
he
goes
into
an
oklahoma
trial
court.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
sir
it
is.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
it
is
on
the
record.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
substantial
evidence.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
he
could
have
asked
for
an
opinion.
i
believe
that
the
vagueness
test
we
have
cited
out
in
grayned
versus
city
of
rockford
is
controlling
in
our
case,
we
notice
that
the
state
employees
have
in
regard
to
the
prohibitions
is
given
not
only
by
the
facial
language
of
the
statute
itself,
but
also
from
rules
and
regulations
set
forth
by
the
personnel
board,
circulars
that
are
issued
by
the
personnel
board
to
each
employee
prescribing
and
setting
forth
what
activities
he
can
be
involved
in,
and
what
activities
he
cannot
be
involved
in.
in
addition,
there
are
attorney
general’s
opinions
which
as
i
indicated
earlier
have
force
and
effect
of
law
and
which
employees
and
agencies
are
required
to
follow.
these
opinions
have
alternatively
down
through
the
years,
interpreted
the
prohibitions
to
be
prohibitions
against
partisan
activity.
the
standards
which
the
personnel
board
has
to
enforce
this
political
activity
prohibition
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
test
and
grant
it.
they
themselves
has
set
forth
rules,
and
they
also
guide
themselves
by
the
federal
hatch
act
prohibitions
through
the
oklahoma
versus
civil
service
commission
case
and
a
provision
in
the
statute
itself
which
requires
them
to
alter
the
rules
and
regulations
which
conflict
with
those
standards
that
apply
to
federal
grants.
so
they
themselves
adhere
to
standards
which
they
set
themselves
and
which
are
set
through
the
federal
hatch
act.
the
employees
themselves
have
access
to
advisory
opinions
from
the
personnel
board
which
is
indicated
to
them
in
a
circular
that
is
distributed.
they
have
access
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
which
further
define
the
prohibition
set
out
in
the
statute,
and
under
certain
conditions
they
can
ask
for
attorney
general’s
opinion
if
they
get
someone
to
ask
who
has
authority
to.
the
broadness
test,
over-breadth
test
that
supplied
to
this
case
particular
in
relation
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
appellants
contend
that
it
prohibits
constitutionally
protected
speech
as
well
as
non-protected.
the
three-judge
panel
correctly
held
that
the
prohibitions
were
against
partisan
political
activity,
and
were
not
over-broad
while
the
specific
language
itself
does
not
with
perhaps
as
certainly
as
appellants
would
like,
connote
that
it
is
only
partisan
political
activity
that
is
prohibited
the
particular
wording
of
the
statute
gives
that
connotation.
in
addition,
the
attorney
general
earlier
in
1968,
in
an
attorney
general’s
opinion
that
those
prohibitions
were
against
partisan
political
activity
only.
the
enforcement
of
those
provisions
by
the
personnel
board
and
the
circulars
that
they
issue
to
state
employees
also
specify
that
they
are
partisan
political
activity
prohibitions.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
i
do
not
really
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
do
not
believe
we
have
had
an
independent
run.
yes,
we
have,
i
will
take
that
back.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
in
last
race.
i
think
if
an
independent
is
running
as
an
independent
and
has
through
his
resources
a
--
i
would
not
say
party
but
a
organization
that
espouses
his
particular
beliefs.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
someone
working
for
that
organization
would
be
very
similar
to
working
for
a
party
and
as
they
are
attempting
to
espouse
to
others,
the
beliefs
of
that
individual
through
his
organization
and
his
platform.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
i
would
think
so,
and
i
would
think
that
the
definition
of
party
politics
is
broadly
that
which
is
aimed
at
instigating
a
state
government
a
particular
belief
or
espousing
a
particular
platform,
which
currently
has
a
two-party
system
but
there
are
independents,
and
other
parties,
actually
american
party
which
--
are
parties
because
they
espouse
a
particular
belief
or
attempt
to
set
forth
particular
policies
in
state
government
which
are
unique
onto
themselves.
so
i
think
in
that
regard,
it
would
be
a
prohibition
against
someone
working
for
an
independent
candidate
via
such
an
organization.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
they
are.
they
are
published.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
they
are
published
and
distributed
to
all
agencies.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
there
are.
there
are
68
opinions
which
interpreted
the
political
activity
prohibitions
until
they
were
partisan
political
activities.
there
have
also
been
other
opinions
down
through
the
years.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
other
citations?
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
have
a
listing
of
some
of
the
opinions
and
what
they
dealt
with.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
we
can
make
them
available
and
then
add
them
to
the
record.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
they
are
published.
they
are
issued
to
the
individual
requesting
the
opinion
and
also
sent
to
state
agencies
to
distribute,
and
to
inform
the
employees.
mr.
mike
d.

i
do
not
believe
we
are
now
putting
them
in
a
bound
volume
but
i
do
not
believe
in
1968
that
they
were
put
any
bound
volume.
i
believe
that
just
occurred
several
years
ago.
they
just
started
six
years,excuse
me.
yes,
we
do
have
a
bound
volume
i
do
not
know
if
you
have
access
to
it
in
your
library.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
there
are
three
that
are
in
the
record
but
they
are
not
inclusive
of
all
that
were
issued.
there
are
a
number
of
more
that
were
issued.
now,
i
will
make
available
as
part
of
the
record
those
opinions.
of
the
states,
22,000
employees,
approximately
20,000
are
under
the
merit
system
as
classified
employees.
the
prohibition
specifically
apply
only
to
classified
employees.
they
do
apply
to
unclassified
employees
to
the
extent
that
unclassified
employees
cannot
attempt
to
solicit
funds
from
classified
employees,
nor
get
them
involved
in
partisan
politics.
the
distinction
for
the
prohibitions
are
related
to
the
enactment
of
the
merit
system
of
personnel
administration.
when
the
personnel
act
was
put
into
effect
in
1959,
these
prohibitions
were
placed
in
there
and
applied
only
to
classified
employees.
the
rationale
of
the
merit
system
is
to
allow
the
employee
to
progress
in
his
work
free
from
outside
influence
including
politics.
the
decision
to
exempt
certain
agencies
and
employees
from
the
classified
system
was
based
primarily
on
the
decision
that
the
populace
needs
some
state
individuals
to
express
their
will.
in
addition,
the
unclassified
employees
are
not
protected
by
the
merit
system
are
subject
to
the
whims
and
caprices
of
their
employees
so
to
speak.
they
have
no
recourse
in
event
that
they
are
terminated
as
to
the
classified
employees.
not
only
are
specific
individuals
exempted
from
the
merit
system
classification,
but
agencies
as
a
whole
are
also
exempted.
while
the
decision
of
the
legislature
to
allow
the
populace
to
express
their
will
to
certain
individuals
was
expressed
in
the
act.
they
also
felt
that
it
was
necessary
for
entire
agencies
because
of
the
nature
of
their
work
to
also
be
exempted,
and
in
this
regard,
the
application
of
the
prohibitions
is
limitedly
applied
to
them.
we
think
that
this
is
a
valid
distinction
that
under
the
prophylactic
approach
of
mitchell,
the
decision
to
include
some
state
employees
under
the
prohibitions
and
exclude
others
is
a
judgment
that
has
to
be
weighed
by
the
state
and
has
experienced
over
the
years
of
the
political
activity
that
they
are
attempting
to
prohibit.
the
governor
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
can
by
executive
order
place
new
agencies
under
the
merit
system
or
existing
agencies
that
are
not
under
the
merit
system.
so
there
is
a
flexibility
as
time
goes
by
for
the
state
to
continue
to
combat
the
evils
of
partisan
politics
by
placing
those
unclassified
employees
and
agencies
under
the
prohibitions.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
he
has
given
authority
by
the
personnel
act
to
place
agencies
under
the
merit
system,
and
that
authority
does
not
exceed
the
exemptions
that
are
already
placed
in
the
statute
itself.
there
are
certain
statutory
exemptions,
but
as
far
as
newly
created
agencies,
he
has
the
authority
to
place
them
under
the
merit
system
by
executive
order.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
the
obvious
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
merit
system
is
to
insulate
him
from
outside
influence
including
politics.
i
think,
the
prohibitions
apply
only
to
classified
employees.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
the
state
unlike
the
federal
government
did
not
till
1959
make
prohibitions
against
political
activity,
and
during
this
long
period
of
years
since
1907
since
we
have
become
a
state,
it
has
been
apparent
to
the
legislature
that
the
political
activity
control
of
state
employees
was
something
which
was
not
good
for
the
state.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
it
was
to
insulate
the
employees
and
to
prohibit
a
party
from
controlling
the
state
and
making
its
desires
and
wishes
of
the
state
instead
of
having
a
neutral
state
government
which
was
not
controlled
by
a
party.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
it
is.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
in
a
retirement
system,
he
is
not
subject
to
dismissal
except
for
cause
that
is
under
a
statute.
they
dismiss,
he
has
a
hearing
for
the
personnel
board
and
there
are
specific
prohibitions
against
using
influence
against
him
either
discriminatory
or
favorable
to
effect
his
promotion
or
his
non-promotion.
so
there
are
basic
--
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
the
employees
will
--
non-classified
employees
also
had
access
to
retirement
system,
but
they
have
no
tenure
in
terms
of
their
dismissal.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
he
has
a
choice
in
terms
of
where
he
applies
to
work.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
i
do.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice.
specifically,
at
the
three-judge
panel
level,
it
was
brought
out
that
this
constitutional
attack
included
only
the
statutory
language
that
the
rules
enacted
by
the
board
were
not
included
in
this
attack,
and
on
that
point
since
we
are
dealing
with
the
facial
and
validation
problem,
the
rules
that
have
been
enacted
by
the
board
in
regard
to
this
area,
were
not
looked
at
or
included
in
terms
of
the
record.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
they
are.
there
is
a
publication
of
the
other
rules
of
the
board
which
are
issued
to
all
the
agencies
and
employees.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
they
are.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
well,
the
personnel
board
even
though
they
had
the
authority
to
enact
rules
and
regulations
to
further
defining
the
prohibitions
in
the
section
818,
they
have
not
extensively
done
so.
the
act
has
only
been
in
effect
14
years.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
we
can
make
those
available
to
the
court
if
they
desire
to
look
at
it.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
yes,
i
will.
mr.
mike
d.
martin
they
had
access
to
the
one
that
was
in
the
record,
but
they
did
not
have
access
to
all
of
them
since
the
plaintiffs,
appellants
here
particularly
noted
that
they
were
not
contesting
those
rules
or
regulations,
just
the
statute.
the
conclusion
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
oklahoma
has
taken
the
prophylactic
approach
of
mitchell
and
we
feel
that
this
is
the
only
classical
way
of
combating
the
evil
that
is
sought
to
be
prohibited.
an
inclusive
approach
of
setting
out
all
the
conduct
that
has
to
be
prohibited
by
the
statute
is
impossible,
a
narrowing
construction
of
the
statute
would
not
have
the
effect
of
combating
the
evils
that
are
sought
to
be
prohibited.
now,
the
prophylactic
approach
of
mitchell
is
valid
whether
it
is
based
upon
the
rational
test,
basis
test,
or
the
compelling
governmental
interest
test
with
the
least
alternative
restrictive
test,
and
we
feel
that
the
court
should
sustain
the
over
court's
holding
that
set
prohibitions
are
constitutional.
