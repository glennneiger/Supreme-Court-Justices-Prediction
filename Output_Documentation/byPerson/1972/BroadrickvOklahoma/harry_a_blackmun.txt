mr.

are
you
challenging
the
oklahoma

on
the
ground
of
vagueness?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
read
your
questions
presented
both
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
your
brief,
and
i
do
not
find
any
mention
of
the
word
vagueness
anywhere.
your
opposition
argues
it
and
i
wondered
whether
you
had
conceded
that
the
statute
was
not
vague?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
maybe,
but
i
agree
with
your
questions
presented,
and
i
find
nothing
like
that
in
your
brief?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
in
any
of
that,
you
are
not
conceding
that?
justice
harry
a.

your
named

were
employees
of
the
corporation
commission?
justice
harry
