justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
his
testimony
on
page
85
in
the
record,
is
this
on
the
raise,
mr.
henderson,
you
plead
guilty,
is
that
right?
sir,
you
plead
guilty,
plead
guilty?
it
was
that
in
this
courtroom
here.
i
was
tried
in
division
one.
did
you
sit
down
at
the
table
and
stand
up
and
say,
you
plead
guilty?
no
sir.
did
your
lawyer
say,
you
plead
guilty?
my
lawyer
mr.
tom
admiral,
all
i
know
that
was
in
a
little
room,
and
came
out,
and
they
said
he
is
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
that's
all
i
know,
and
they
gave
me
99
years,
that's
all
i
know,
and
i
didn't
plead
guilty.
i
didn't
plead
at
all,
did
state
put
anything
on
any
record
of
the
proceeding
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
all
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
didn't
attack
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea,
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
here
at
least
he
testified,
he
never
plead
guilty
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
obviously
a
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
though?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
that
at
the
end
here
at
pages
8,
a128,
there
are
excerpts
of
proceedings
in
1948,
largely
they
were
dealing
with
the
selection
of
the
jury.
it
doesn't
seem
to
be,
or
at
least
i
don't
find
any
here,
any
minutes
of
the
proceeding
at
which
he
said
to
have
plead
guilty,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
137?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
there
was
any
colloquy
between
judge
and
this
petitioner
when
his
plea
was
entered?(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
this
was
back
in
1948?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
at
least
any
transcript
of
any
proceeding,
involving
any
kind
of
colloquy
with
the
court
when
his
plea
of
guilty
was
entered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hoefle,
under
tennessee
practice
at
that
time,
when
the
guilty
determined
punishment
after
the
entry
of
a
guilty
plea,
was
that
limited
to
giving
him
a
--
well,
or
was
a
death
penalty
then
excluded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
if
he
pleaded
guilty,
and
he
might
still
have
got
the
death
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
how
did
the
--
you
make
assumption
that
back
in
1948
that
the
jury
would
not
bring
in
the
death
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
judge
addresses
the
jury
this
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

see.
