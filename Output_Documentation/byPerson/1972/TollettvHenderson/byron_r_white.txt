do

was
there
anything

in

justice

white
i
know,

that

to
about
the

but
how
about,
are
there
any

plea
wasn't
accurate?
justice
byron

white
did
he
allege
his

justice

white
is
there
a

what
do
you

he
pleaded

well,
at

it
sound
he
didn't,
although
with
the

if
the
issue
of
whether
he
pleaded

yes,
there

aren't
you
in

you
are

do
you
