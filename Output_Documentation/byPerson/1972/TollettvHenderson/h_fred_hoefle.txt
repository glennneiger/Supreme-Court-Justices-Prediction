mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think
we
can
assume
following
counsel's
argument
that
there
is
no
real
question
now
that
the
rights
of
mr.
henderson
to
a
grand
jury
from
which
members
of
this
race
have
not
been
systematically
excluded,
was
violated.
this
was
conceded
by
the
state
of
tennessee
in
the
district
court.
it
was
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit.
this
court
has
held
recently
that
this
is
prejudicial.
there
were
no
blacks
on
the
grand
jury
from
1922
until
1953.
25%
of
the
population
of
that
county
in
1948
was
black.
this
is
a
violation
of
the
respondent's
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
as
well
as
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
might
point
out
that
any
analogy
with
the
federal
rules
i
think
would
be
ruled
out,
because
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
available
to
federal
prisoners.
it's
a
prohibition
on
the
states.
this
court
has
also
held
recently
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice.
he
doesn't
have
to
show
actual
bias
or
actual
harm,
but
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice
when
his
grand
jury
--
when
the
members
of
his
race
have
been
excluded
from
his
grand
jury.
i
pointed
the
case
of
alexander
versus
louisiana,
decided
last
year
where
a
timely
motion
was
filed
to
object
to
the
grand
jury,
but
no
objection
was
raised
as
to
the
petit
jury.
he
went
to
trail
to
the
petit
jury
and
was
convicted,
and
this
court
nevertheless
reversed
because
it
felt
that
the
denial
of
members
of
his
race
from
the
grand
jury
was
sufficiently
important
that
it
could
not
be
cured
even
though
he
were
tried
by
a
constitutionally
acceptable
jury.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
it's
a
pathetic
factor,
your
honor.
i
think
it
only
indicates
that
he
did
not
find
out
that
he
had
this
right
for
20
years.
in
the
previous
case
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
about
holding
something
in
reserve.
well,
i
know
i
have
got
this
right,
i
will
see
how
i
do
on
my
trial
for
sentence
like,
is
lighter
i
get
acquitted,
i
will
forget
it.
if
i
am
convicted
it,
then
i'll
raise
it.
that
can't
be
applied
here
because
mr.
henderson
wouldn't
wait
20
years
to
raise
it,
he
might
wait
six
months
or
a
year,
and
then
bring
it
up.
this
has
been
20
years.
the
testimony
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
don't
think
the
law
has
ever
changed
on
this
point
your
honor.
since
fay,
as
far
as
exclusion
from
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no,
but
since
1880
this
has
been
a
violation
of
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
don't
think
so.
there
was
a
case
in
1945,
the
name
escapes
me
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
rice
versus
olson,
where
a
similar
waiver
was
into
a
grand
jury
was
raised.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
the
fact
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
right
to
object.
there
is
an
affidavit
in
the
record
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
he
alleged,
and
he
has
alleged
that
his
guilty
plea
was
more
or
less
coerced
out
of
him.
his
attorney
was
not
present
when
he
was
taken
from
jail
about
four
days
before
the
plea,
taken
to
the
prosecutor's
office.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no,
he
alleged
his
attorney
was
not
there
at
the
time
the
arrangement
was
made
for
the
plea,
four
days
before
his
trial
date
they
took
him
out
into
the
meeting
with
the
prosecutor,
and
the
police,
and
threatening
with
a
chair.
that's
when
he
says,
he
decided
to
plead
guilty.
his
lawyer
wasn't
even
at
that
meeting.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
also
the
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
pneumonia,
that's
correct.
so
i
think
he
would
have
a
proximate
cause
defense
there,
and
that
would
be
a
good
reason
not
the
waive
this
right
had
he
known
it,
because
a
properly
constituted
grand
jury
might
have
felt
pneumonia,
maybe
we
can't
indict
him
at
all,
or
maybe
armed
robbery
or
aggravated
assault,
or
whatever
they
call
it
in
tennessee,
assault
with
the
deadly
weapon,
there
or
many
things.
and
this
court
has
also
said
recently,
in
jury
exclusion
cases,
it's
impossible
to
speculate
on
what
the
jury
would
have
said
or
done
and
this
would
apply
to
a
grand
jury
as
well
as
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
this
is
all
i
have
your
honor,
what
is
in
there
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
this
i
don't
know,
it
would
not
be
--
i
was
appointed
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
i
never
had
access
to
the
tennessee
records
down
there,
your
honor.
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
while
we
are
in
here
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
on
page
95
and
96
of
the
single
appendix,
i
believe
i
don't
see
a
date
on
it,
but
yes,
it
was
1968
when
he
filed
this
affidavit.
he
was
not
aware,
he
had
never
been
aware
of
any
irregularity
in
grand
jury
selection,
he
had
never
advised
his
client,
he
never
discussed
it
about
it.
if
the
petitioner,
which
is
mr.
henderson
had
any
knowledge
of
it,
he
certainly
did
not
talk
to
mr.
murray,
his
attorney
about
it.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
there
is
no
question
if
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
he
was
also
sentenced
your
honor
by
a
jury.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
whether
he
pleaded
guilty,
this,
what
justice
brennan
has
said,
raises
a
question.
unfortunately
this
was
not
raised.
i
feel
that
i
am
limited
in
this
proceeding
to
defending
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion,
and
the
sixth
circuit
has
said
that
they
didn't
reach
that
issue
because
henderson
didn't
raise
it
in
the
district
court,
so
here
we
are.
it
does
disturb
me,
but
i
think
that
it
can
be
affirmed
on
ample
grounds.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
your
honor.
and
also
the
other
issues
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
well,
first
of
all
those
cases
all
evolved
about
--
there
was
a
consultation
between
counsel
and
client
in
those
cases.
these
cases
also
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
it
has
got
a
lot
to
do
as
far
as
the
grand
jury,
because
there
was
no
consultation.
henderson
didn't
know
about
it,
the
lawyer
didn't
know
about
it.
so
how
can
he
waive
it
if
he
didn't
know
it?
i
feel
this
comes
completely
within
the
purview
of
fay
and
johnson
versus
zerbst.
now
the
circuits,
i
think
five
of
them
to
date
have
distinguished
the
mcmann
cases
on
which
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
the
part
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that's
part
of
it,
and
also
another
part
is,
it
wasn't
really
voluntary,
he
didn't
attack
that,
but
these
are
all
facets
of
the
same
thing.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no,
but
i
think
it's
almost
implicit
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that's
true.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
these
are
all
part
of
the
same
thing.
i
have
chosen
to
base
my
argument
on
the
what
i
feel
is
plain
clear
law
in
humphrey
versus
katie,
peters
versus
cliff,
alexander
versus
louisiana,
which
this
court
has
decided
the
last
term.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
there
is
your
honor,
a137.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
this
is
--
it's
not
a
transcript
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
pardon
me,
135.
it's
more
or
less
i
guess
a
journal
entry
setting
forth,
the
fact
that
it
came
on
hearing
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
that
these
jurors
were
sworn
to
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
--
and
i
assume
they
were
all
white
also,
but
he
didn't
(voice
overlap)
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
another
thing
that
the
requirements
of
boykin
about
the
fact
that
the
judge
must
satisfy
himself.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
righ.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
could
find
then
your
honor
there
are
transcripts
in
your
testimony
that
occurred
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
state
court,
which
is
what
was
relied
upon
by
the
in
lieu
of
the
hearing
by
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
henderson
did
your
honor,
it
was
per
se.
i
didn't
get
into
it
till
the
circuit
court
level.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
he
defined
to
consider,
he
indicated
i
believe
that
--
first
of
all
he
went
forth
on
the
systematic
exclusion
issue,
and
did
not
consider
the
others.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
to
sentence.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
was
just
for
the
punishment.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
and
they
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
assume
they
were
all
white
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
it
would
seemed
that
there
have
been
some
discussion,
but
i
would
see
how
we
can
infer
that.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
i
guess
based
on
the
plea
they
determined
the
guilt
and
went
on
from
there.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
am
not
sure
it
doesn't
say,
i
am
not
familiar
with
tennessee
procedure,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
he
might
have.
i
think
that
was
a
distinct
possibility,
but
again,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
the
record
that
we
have
indicates
that
the
decedent
died
of
pneumonia.
perhaps
it
was
caused
by
the
gunshot
wound,
perhaps
it
wasn't,
it's
hard
to
say.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
i
don't
--
not
by
statute,
i
don't
believe
and
there
are
some
states
have
excluded
that
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
believe
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
i
really
--
i
don't
want
to
give
you
definitive
answer
on
that
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
assume
that
was
possible.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
assume
it
is
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
the
only
thing
is
again,
in
one
of
our
recent
theories
and
cases
last
year,
i
don't
remember
which
one,
but
it
was
stated
real
emphatically
that
it's
impossible
to
tell
what
the
jury
would
have
done.
who
knows
what
the
grand
jury
would
have
done,
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
decedent
died
of
pneumonia.
it's
obviously
prejudicial,
they
had
been
doing
this
at
that
time
for
68
years
down
in
tennessee.
mr.
henderson
was
totally
ignorant
of
his
right
to
object
for
20
years.
his
lawyer
didn't
tell
him.
his
lawyer
came
in
and
testified,
and
the
state
did
not
challenge
his
lawyer
as
they
could
have.
what
did
you
talk
about,
besides
the
fact
that
you
didn't
talk
about
the
fact
that
he
had
a
bad
grand
jury.
the
one
thing
i
do
want
to
mention
about
the
mcmann
case
is
also,
number
one,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
act
of
waiver
in
tennessee
is
the
entry
of
a
plea.
it
doesn't
matter
if
had
pleaded
not
guilty
under
tennessee
law,
that
would
have
been
as
effective
a
waiver
has
he
had
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
without
motion,
yes.
without
filing
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
plea
was
guilty,
can
be
said
to
be
a
separate
ground.
in
the
post
leary,
and
cases
dealing
with
the
narcotics
transfer
tax
and
the
firearms
tax,
five
circuits
have
held
that
people,
defendants
who
have
pleaded
guilty
prior
to
these
decisions,
they
have
not
waived
by
pleading
guilty.
their
rights
to
object
to
the
self
incrimination
things,
that
aspects
to
this
court
found
invalid.
the
circuits
that
have
decided
this
are
unanimous.
they
are
saying,
we
are
not
attacking
the
fact
that
the
plea
was
voluntary.
we
are
saying,
he
did
plea
guilty
voluntarily,
but
even
in
doing
so
there
he
did
not
intend
to
waive
his
right
to
raise
his
objection
had
he
known
about
it.
now
even
there,
there
would
have
been
some
inkling
i
would
think,
they
knew
these
cases
were
on
their
way
upstairs,
but
i
don't
think
mr.
henderson
even
had
that
much
benefit.
the
fifth
circuit
in
at
least
sixth
cases,
and
in
one
case
particularly,
they
took
judicial
notice
to
the
fact
that
white
lawyers
representing
black
defendants
in
the
south,
rarely
to
the
point
of
never
raised
these
objections
at
the
proper
time,
if
they
ever.
i
don't
see,
i
think
this
case
squarely
falls
within
fay
v.
noia
and
johnson
versus
zerbst.
i
am
afraid
that
if
the
court
does
reverse
that
the
impact
of
these
cases
is
going
to
be
lost,
and
it
will
all
go
back
to
the
state
courts
and
they'll
have
to
determine,
federal
rights.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
and
that
i
would
believe
that
was
a
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
then
in
tennessee
supreme
court
i
believe
in
another
opinion
said
that
rather
regretfully
declined
henderson
the
relief
and
said
perhaps
it
is
over
due,
it
should
come
from
someone
higher
than
us
and
here
we
are.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
and
what
is
this
objection
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
am
sorry—
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no
sir,
i
am
sorry.
i
was
quoting
the
fifth
circuit
and
i
guess
they
were
talking
for
their
circuit
which
tennessee
is
part
of
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
there
was
i
believe.
i
might
point
out
in
that
situation
on
the
kennedy
case
that
there
is
a
distinction
the
maury
county
grand
jury
was
perhaps
disproportionately
represented
with
blacks
but
it
did
some
blacks
on
it.
this
county
had
not.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think
we
can
assume
following
counsel's
argument
that
there
is
no
real
question
now
that
the
rights
of
mr.
henderson
to
a
grand
jury
from
which
members
of
this
race
have
not
been
systematically
excluded,
was
violated.
this
was
conceded
by
the
state
of
tennessee
in
the
district
court.
it
was
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit.
this
court
has
held
recently
that
this
is
prejudicial.
there
were
no
blacks
on
the
grand
jury
from
1922
until
1953.
25%
of
the
population
of
that
county
in
1948
was
black.
this
is
a
violation
of
the
respondent's
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
as
well
as
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
might
point
out
that
any
analogy
with
the
federal
rules
i
think
would
be
ruled
out,
because
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
available
to
federal
prisoners.
it's
a
prohibition
on
the
states.
this
court
has
also
held
recently
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice.
he
doesn't
have
to
show
actual
bias
or
actual
harm,
but
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice
when
his
grand
jury
--
when
the
members
of
his
race
have
been
excluded
from
his
grand
jury.
i
pointed
the
case
of
alexander
versus
louisiana,
decided
last
year
where
a
timely
motion
was
filed
to
object
to
the
grand
jury,
but
no
objection
was
raised
as
to
the
petit
jury.
he
went
to
trail
to
the
petit
jury
and
was
convicted,
and
this
court
nevertheless
reversed
because
it
felt
that
the
denial
of
members
of
his
race
from
the
grand
jury
was
sufficiently
important
that
it
could
not
be
cured
even
though
he
were
tried
by
a
constitutionally
acceptable
jury.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
it's
a
pathetic
factor,
your
honor.
i
think
it
only
indicates
that
he
did
not
find
out
that
he
had
this
right
for
20
years.
in
the
previous
case
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
about
holding
something
in
reserve.
well,
i
know
i
have
got
this
right,
i
will
see
how
i
do
on
my
trial
for
sentence
like,
is
lighter
i
get
acquitted,
i
will
forget
it.
if
i
am
convicted
it,
then
i'll
raise
it.
that
can't
be
applied
here
because
mr.
henderson
wouldn't
wait
20
years
to
raise
it,
he
might
wait
six
months
or
a
year,
and
then
bring
it
up.
this
has
been
20
years.
the
testimony
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
don't
think
the
law
has
ever
changed
on
this
point
your
honor.
since
fay,
as
far
as
exclusion
from
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no,
but
since
1880
this
has
been
a
violation
of
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
don't
think
so.
there
was
a
case
in
1945,
the
name
escapes
me
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
rice
versus
olson,
where
a
similar
waiver
was
into
a
grand
jury
was
raised.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
the
fact
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
right
to
object.
there
is
an
affidavit
in
the
record
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
he
alleged,
and
he
has
alleged
that
his
guilty
plea
was
more
or
less
coerced
out
of
him.
his
attorney
was
not
present
when
he
was
taken
from
jail
about
four
days
before
the
plea,
taken
to
the
prosecutor's
office.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no,
he
alleged
his
attorney
was
not
there
at
the
time
the
arrangement
was
made
for
the
plea,
four
days
before
his
trial
date
they
took
him
out
into
the
meeting
with
the
prosecutor,
and
the
police,
and
threatening
with
a
chair.
that's
when
he
says,
he
decided
to
plead
guilty.
his
lawyer
wasn't
even
at
that
meeting.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
also
the
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
pneumonia,
that's
correct.
so
i
think
he
would
have
a
proximate
cause
defense
there,
and
that
would
be
a
good
reason
not
the
waive
this
right
had
he
known
it,
because
a
properly
constituted
grand
jury
might
have
felt
pneumonia,
maybe
we
can't
indict
him
at
all,
or
maybe
armed
robbery
or
aggravated
assault,
or
whatever
they
call
it
in
tennessee,
assault
with
the
deadly
weapon,
there
or
many
things.
and
this
court
has
also
said
recently,
in
jury
exclusion
cases,
it's
impossible
to
speculate
on
what
the
jury
would
have
said
or
done
and
this
would
apply
to
a
grand
jury
as
well
as
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
this
is
all
i
have
your
honor,
what
is
in
there
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
this
i
don't
know,
it
would
not
be
--
i
was
appointed
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
i
never
had
access
to
the
tennessee
records
down
there,
your
honor.
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
while
we
are
in
here
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
on
page
95
and
96
of
the
single
appendix,
i
believe
i
don't
see
a
date
on
it,
but
yes,
it
was
1968
when
he
filed
this
affidavit.
he
was
not
aware,
he
had
never
been
aware
of
any
irregularity
in
grand
jury
selection,
he
had
never
advised
his
client,
he
never
discussed
it
about
it.
if
the
petitioner,
which
is
mr.
henderson
had
any
knowledge
of
it,
he
certainly
did
not
talk
to
mr.
murray,
his
attorney
about
it.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
there
is
no
question
if
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
he
was
also
sentenced
your
honor
by
a
jury.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
whether
he
pleaded
guilty,
this,
what
justice
brennan
has
said,
raises
a
question.
unfortunately
this
was
not
raised.
i
feel
that
i
am
limited
in
this
proceeding
to
defending
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion,
and
the
sixth
circuit
has
said
that
they
didn't
reach
that
issue
because
henderson
didn't
raise
it
in
the
district
court,
so
here
we
are.
it
does
disturb
me,
but
i
think
that
it
can
be
affirmed
on
ample
grounds.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
your
honor.
and
also
the
other
issues
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
well,
first
of
all
those
cases
all
evolved
about
--
there
was
a
consultation
between
counsel
and
client
in
those
cases.
these
cases
also
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
it
has
got
a
lot
to
do
as
far
as
the
grand
jury,
because
there
was
no
consultation.
henderson
didn't
know
about
it,
the
lawyer
didn't
know
about
it.
so
how
can
he
waive
it
if
he
didn't
know
it?
i
feel
this
comes
completely
within
the
purview
of
fay
and
johnson
versus
zerbst.
now
the
circuits,
i
think
five
of
them
to
date
have
distinguished
the
mcmann
cases
on
which
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
the
part
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that's
part
of
it,
and
also
another
part
is,
it
wasn't
really
voluntary,
he
didn't
attack
that,
but
these
are
all
facets
of
the
same
thing.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no,
but
i
think
it's
almost
implicit
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that's
true.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
these
are
all
part
of
the
same
thing.
i
have
chosen
to
base
my
argument
on
the
what
i
feel
is
plain
clear
law
in
humphrey
versus
katie,
peters
versus
cliff,
alexander
versus
louisiana,
which
this
court
has
decided
the
last
term.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
there
is
your
honor,
a137.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
this
is
--
it's
not
a
transcript
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
pardon
me,
135.
it's
more
or
less
i
guess
a
journal
entry
setting
forth,
the
fact
that
it
came
on
hearing
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
that
these
jurors
were
sworn
to
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
--
and
i
assume
they
were
all
white
also,
but
he
didn't
(voice
overlap)
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
another
thing
that
the
requirements
of
boykin
about
the
fact
that
the
judge
must
satisfy
himself.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
righ.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
could
find
then
your
honor
there
are
transcripts
in
your
testimony
that
occurred
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
state
court,
which
is
what
was
relied
upon
by
the
in
lieu
of
the
hearing
by
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
henderson
did
your
honor,
it
was
per
se.
i
didn't
get
into
it
till
the
circuit
court
level.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
he
defined
to
consider,
he
indicated
i
believe
that
--
first
of
all
he
went
forth
on
the
systematic
exclusion
issue,
and
did
not
consider
the
others.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
to
sentence.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
was
just
for
the
punishment.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
and
they
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
assume
they
were
all
white
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
it
would
seemed
that
there
have
been
some
discussion,
but
i
would
see
how
we
can
infer
that.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
i
guess
based
on
the
plea
they
determined
the
guilt
and
went
on
from
there.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
am
not
sure
it
doesn't
say,
i
am
not
familiar
with
tennessee
procedure,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
he
might
have.
i
think
that
was
a
distinct
possibility,
but
again,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
the
record
that
we
have
indicates
that
the
decedent
died
of
pneumonia.
perhaps
it
was
caused
by
the
gunshot
wound,
perhaps
it
wasn't,
it's
hard
to
say.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
i
don't
--
not
by
statute,
i
don't
believe
and
there
are
some
states
have
excluded
that
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
believe
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
i
really
--
i
don't
want
to
give
you
definitive
answer
on
that
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
assume
that
was
possible.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
assume
it
is
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
the
only
thing
is
again,
in
one
of
our
recent
theories
and
cases
last
year,
i
don't
remember
which
one,
but
it
was
stated
real
emphatically
that
it's
impossible
to
tell
what
the
jury
would
have
done.
who
knows
what
the
grand
jury
would
have
done,
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
decedent
died
of
pneumonia.
it's
obviously
prejudicial,
they
had
been
doing
this
at
that
time
for
68
years
down
in
tennessee.
mr.
henderson
was
totally
ignorant
of
his
right
to
object
for
20
years.
his
lawyer
didn't
tell
him.
his
lawyer
came
in
and
testified,
and
the
state
did
not
challenge
his
lawyer
as
they
could
have.
what
did
you
talk
about,
besides
the
fact
that
you
didn't
talk
about
the
fact
that
he
had
a
bad
grand
jury.
the
one
thing
i
do
want
to
mention
about
the
mcmann
case
is
also,
number
one,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
act
of
waiver
in
tennessee
is
the
entry
of
a
plea.
it
doesn't
matter
if
had
pleaded
not
guilty
under
tennessee
law,
that
would
have
been
as
effective
a
waiver
has
he
had
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
without
motion,
yes.
without
filing
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
plea
was
guilty,
can
be
said
to
be
a
separate
ground.
in
the
post
leary,
and
cases
dealing
with
the
narcotics
transfer
tax
and
the
firearms
tax,
five
circuits
have
held
that
people,
defendants
who
have
pleaded
guilty
prior
to
these
decisions,
they
have
not
waived
by
pleading
guilty.
their
rights
to
object
to
the
self
incrimination
things,
that
aspects
to
this
court
found
invalid.
the
circuits
that
have
decided
this
are
unanimous.
they
are
saying,
we
are
not
attacking
the
fact
that
the
plea
was
voluntary.
we
are
saying,
he
did
plea
guilty
voluntarily,
but
even
in
doing
so
there
he
did
not
intend
to
waive
his
right
to
raise
his
objection
had
he
known
about
it.
now
even
there,
there
would
have
been
some
inkling
i
would
think,
they
knew
these
cases
were
on
their
way
upstairs,
but
i
don't
think
mr.
henderson
even
had
that
much
benefit.
the
fifth
circuit
in
at
least
sixth
cases,
and
in
one
case
particularly,
they
took
judicial
notice
to
the
fact
that
white
lawyers
representing
black
defendants
in
the
south,
rarely
to
the
point
of
never
raised
these
objections
at
the
proper
time,
if
they
ever.
i
don't
see,
i
think
this
case
squarely
falls
within
fay
v.
noia
and
johnson
versus
zerbst.
i
am
afraid
that
if
the
court
does
reverse
that
the
impact
of
these
cases
is
going
to
be
lost,
and
it
will
all
go
back
to
the
state
courts
and
they'll
have
to
determine,
federal
rights.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
and
that
i
would
believe
that
was
a
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
then
in
tennessee
supreme
court
i
believe
in
another
opinion
said
that
rather
regretfully
declined
henderson
the
relief
and
said
perhaps
it
is
over
due,
it
should
come
from
someone
higher
than
us
and
here
we
are.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
and
what
is
this
objection
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
am
sorry—
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no
sir,
i
am
sorry.
i
was
quoting
the
fifth
circuit
and
i
guess
they
were
talking
for
their
circuit
which
tennessee
is
part
of
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
there
was
i
believe.
i
might
point
out
in
that
situation
on
the
kennedy
case
that
there
is
a
distinction
the
maury
county
grand
jury
was
perhaps
disproportionately
represented
with
blacks
but
it
did
some
blacks
on
it.
this
county
had
not.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
thank
you,
your
honor.
