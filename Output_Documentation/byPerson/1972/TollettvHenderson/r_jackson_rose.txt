mr.
r.
jackson
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
black
defendant
who
was
indicted
in
davidson
county,
tennessee
in
1948
by
a
grand
jury
which
did
not
and
had
not
for
some
years
before,
and
did
not
for
some
years
after
include
a
member
of
black
race.
mr.
richardson
with
the
advise
and
consent
of
retained
counsel,
entered
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
accepted
a
sentence
of
99
years
in
the
state
penitentiary.
in
1964,
mr.
henderson
first
came
back
into
the
courts
when
he
attacked
or
alleged
that
his
confession
was
coerced,
and
that
his
guilty
plea
was
involuntary.
the
case
was
ultimately
heard
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
federal
district
court,
the
sixth
circuit,
denied
him
relief
and
this
court
denied
cert.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
no,
your
honor,
none.
there
was
reference
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
state
court
at
this
case
that
he
was
advised
at
that
time
that
he
could
raise
this
question
by
the
--
advised
by
the
attorney
that
represented
him
at
that
time.
the
state
court
granted
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
then
we
have
moved
to
1967.
the
state
granted
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
the
proof
as
i
have
stated
earlier
showed
that
there
had
been
no
blacks
to
serve
on
the
grand
jury
from
1922
until
1953,
when
the
first
black
was
put
on
the
davidson
county
grand
jury.
the
selection
system
from
1947
was
that
the
trial
judges,
criminal
trial
judges
would
pick
the
people
that
they
wanted
on
the
grand
jury.
there
was
no
random
selection.
the
court
denied
relief,
the
state
court
did,
and
ultimately
the
tennessee
appellate
court
said
that
he
had
waived
the
right
by
his
failure
to
object
by
plea
of
indictment,
prior
to
entering
a
plea
to
the
indictment.
the
rule
in
tennessee
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
rule
12
(b)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
for
criminal
procedure.
he
filed
a
petition,
of
course,
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court,
and
that
court
granted
the
relief
on
the
basis
of
the
conclusion
of
the
court
that
the
grand
jury
was
void,
it
therefore
rendered
a
void
indictment,
and
that
he
could
not
have
waived
it
because
no
attorney
in
tennessee
would
have
thought
of
raising
the
question
in
1948.
quoting
the
statement
from
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
about
judge
harvard
(ph),
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
indictment
was
not
void,
but
voidable,
but
under
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case
in
light
of
back
that
one
of
our
judges
had
stated,
no
lawyer
would
have
thought
of
raising
this
in
1948
that
mr.
henderson
was
entitled
to
the
relief
that
it
was
not
a
knowing
intelligent
waiver.
it
is
our
position
that
mr.
henderson
waived
his
right
to
the
taxes
twice.
once
by
entering
a
plea
at
all,
or
before
raising
it
and
the
second
time
when
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
the
first
issue
of
waiving
it,
by
failing
to
question
it
prior
to
waive
--
entering
a
plea
to
indictment,
we
follow
the
same
line
of
reasoning
generally,
that
government
did
in
the
proceeding
case.
the
court
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
petition
for
that
reason
in
the
district
court.
i
did
not
pursue
that
issue
in
there,
sorry,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
at
least
that
was
my
original
position
in
this
case.
this
court
as
has
been
stated
earlier
here
today,
has
held
that
where
a
defendant
is
convicted
as
the
result
of
some
illegal
evidence,
or
illegal
proceedings
that
went
to
the
question
or
the
issue
of
innocence
or
guilt,
that
it
must
be
knowing
intelligent
waiver.
in
this
case,
if
i
may
state
to
the
court,
this
is
typically
of
what
--
or
shall
i
say
hypothetical
situation.
here
is
a
retained
counsel.
he
has
a
client
who
is
facing
a
possible
death
penalty,
and
he
has
really
one
thing
in
mind,
the
welfare
of
his
client
theoretically.
assuming
that
this
issue
crosses
his
mind,
his
client
is
in
jail,
his
client
has
made
a
confession,
and
taking
the
feeling
of
the
times
in
1948,
has
a
pretty
chance
of
getting
the
death
penalty
or
at
least
a
reasonable
chance
of
getting
the
death
penalty.
and
the
issue
of
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
crosses
his
mind,
he
is
going
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
if
i
raise
that,
what
will
happen?
i
will
be
successful,
and
there
will
be
blacks
included
on
the
grand
jury
that
will
consider
the
re-indictment
of
him,
but
this
grand
jury
has
a
confession
in
front
of
it.
it
is
my
position,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
question
the
fact
that
in
all
likelihood
a
solid
black
grand
jury
would
have
been
indicted
him
in
the
face
of
this
confession.
now,
this
would
gain
him
additional
time
if
he
wanted
additional
time,
but
there
is
no
speculation
really
that
could
come
to
that
conclusion
in
this
case,
because
he
had
successfully
negotiated
a
plea.
he
had
agreed
apparently
successfully,
at
least
he
eliminated
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty.
the
only
other
reason
that
it
could
have
--
that
an
attorney
would
have
considered
waiving
it,
or
raising
it
at
that
time,
would
be
to
further
the
calls
of
civil
rights
on
this
particular
issue,
to
attempt
to
eliminate
this
illegal
method,
but
it
would
have
no
effect
on
his
client.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
before
a
plea
was
entered
to
the
indictment,
whether
there
be
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
just
that
there
was
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
maybe
the
record
does
not
show,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
at
this
point,
but
this
was
typically
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
there
is
no
indication
that
there
was,
your
honor.
this
would
typically
be
the
situation,
and
where
a
retained
counsel
agrees
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
for
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
the
question
of
knowing
intelligent
waiver.
i
say
in
this
case,
knowing
intelligent
waiver
took
place.
mr.
henderson's
retained
counsel,
apparently
and
obviously
discussed
it,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
he
--
and
this
was
raised
by
mr.
henderson
in
an
earlier
thing
that
his
attorney,
or
that
he
reluctantly
did
it,
but
that
his
attorney
talked
to
him
in
to
entering
a
plea
of
guilty.
they
have
talked
about
this,
and
they
have
finally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
is
the
best
thing.
at
this
point,
i
think
mr.
henderson
do,
and
i
think
the
record,
and
the
entire
record
in
these
proceedings
support
this,
that
from
that
moment
on
he
had
no
more
standing
in
court,
that
he
was
facing
a
term
of
99
years,
that
he
had
eliminated
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty,
that
the
proceedings
were
over.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
over
for
him
for
some
16
years,
before
he
ever
came
back
to
court
for
anything.
the
evidence
or
the
circumstantial
evidence
points
to
the
fact
that
he
knew,
and
the
court
has
found
earlier
that
it
was
a
voluntary
plea
of
guilty.
that
he
knew
at
the
time
he
entered
death
plea,
that
this
was
end
of
the
proceedings.
i
am
sure
that
he
did
not
know
constitutional
law,
that
he
had
numerous
rights
which
many
of
us
spent
years
studying
those
particular
hearings
in
law
schools,
and
after
we
are
out
too.
there
is
no
evidence,
and
i
could
admit
candidly
to
this
court
that
i
am
sure
that
it
did
not
happen,
that
these
were
discussed
with
him.
i
dare
say
that
there
is
a
prisoner
in
a
penal
institutions
in
tennessee
who
knows
all
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
very
few
lawyers,
but
here
is
plea
of
guilty,
was
knowing,
intelligent,
and
that
he
knew
the
consequences
of
it.
he
knew
that
he
has
had
his
day
in
court,
and
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
line.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
30
years.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
the
same,
any
penalties
you
are
entitled
in
a
maximum
of
30
years.
as
there
was
some
question
about
whether
the
guilty
plea
was
raised,
the
voluntariness
of
guilty
plea.
this
question
was
raised
earlier
it
was
decided
in
the
case
of
henderson,
the
henderson
in
sixth
circuit
number
1785
in
1968
and
cert
was
denied
in
391
us
927
by
this
court.
according
to
the
list
that
is
in
my
petition
for
certiorari,
the
appendix
of
page
2a
in
the
footnotes
to
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
in
those
early
or
pro
se
petitions
he
did
claim
that
his
confession
had
been
coerced
and
that
his
guilty
of
plea
was
therefore
involuntary.
he
also
asserted
that
he
had
been
denied
the
assistance
of
counsel.
the
district
court
considered
these
claims
and
decided
they
might
virtually
on
the
merits
we
affirm.
the
question
of
impaneling
a
jury
to
impose
sentence,
this
is
done
in
tennessee
as
it
might
appear
to
be
somewhat
of
a
fiction,
where
there
will
be
a
negotiated
plea,
a
jury
is
impaneled,
the
situation
is
presented
to
the
jury
typically
by
the
district
attorney
general.
he
says,
it
is
the
recommendation
of
the
state
and
we
have
agreed
to
a
number
of
years,
being
99,
the
jury
walks
out
and
comes
back
in
and
back
at
that
time,
many
times
there
was
evidence,
some
evidence
introduced
to
the
jury
even
though
there
was
a
guilty
plea.
this
is
not
necessary
now,
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
necessary
then
but
at
any
rate
it
was
done
and
it
has
been
done
in
recent
years
and
has
been
practice
throughout.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
please
the
court
that
is
the
problem
i
have
never
been
faced
with.
i
say
typically
when
it
is
presented
to
whom
that
it
the
guilty
plea
is
going
in
for
99
years
sentence,
do
you
agree
with
that,
that
is
about
the
way
it
is
presented
to
the
jury.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
and
the
jury
in
the
cases
that
i
have
been
involved
in
always
came
back
and
did
what
the
judge
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
well
not
necessarily
i
have
seen
them,
as
i
recall
now
and
i
did
not
realize
we
had
get
into
this
i
have
seen
them,
if
they
say
so
you
all
and
will
you
raise
your
hand.
now
that
i
am
refreshing
my
memory
on
it.
i
would
like
to
bring
up,
the
parker
case
was
brought
up,
i
am
sure
this
court
is
aware
of
it,
but
the
four
circuit
did
deny
parker
relief
in
december
of
this
past
year
on
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
on
the
same
issue
that
is
presented
here
today
and
relied
on
the
trilogy
richardson
versus
mcmann,
brady
and
parker
previously
decided
by
this
court.
the
number
of
that
in
that
court
is
in
71-1925
parker
versus
ross.
this
is
not
--
i
would
like
to
reiterate
further
or
in
answer
to
mr.
hoefle,
this
is
not
similar
to
noia
or
johnson
or
there
is
a
distinguishing
characteristic
that
is
one
that
he
knowingly
intelligently
made
a
guilty
plea
knowing
the
consequences
of
it,
had
his
day
in
court
and
knew
that
it
was
over
and
number
two
the
constitutional
error
alleged
in
this
case
did
not
go
to
the
innocence
or
guilt
and
was
a
matter
that
was
curable
at
that
time,
but
that
is
not
curable
at
this
time.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
the
record
does
not
say
that.
the
lawyer
filed
an
affidavit
in
this
record.
he
said
i
did
not
know
that
blacks
systematically
excluded
in
1948.
i
did
not
know
that
on
the
grand
jury
i
do
not
know
today
that
they
were
excluded.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
no
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
i
am
sure
--
i
mean
i
have
to
concede
that
this
was
not
discussed
and
from
the
record
was
not
entertained
in
the
mind
of
the
the
attorney
or
the
defendant,
mr.
henderson
at
that
time.
i
say
it
is
knowing
intelligent
waiver
even
though
they
did
not
directly
say
we
don't
waive
this
he
knew
that
he
was
waiving
everything.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
knowing
intelligent
plea
of
guilty
and
that
it
was
a
conclusion
of
his
proceeding.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
waiver
to
right
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes,
your
honor
in
a
curable
defect
that
existed
at
this
time.
his
affidavit
was
just
that
he
had
no
knowledge
that
they
were
excluded
at
that
time
from
the
grand
jury,
from
the
petit
jury
on
page
895
of
the
appendix
and
a96.
he
did
not
say
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
right
to
attack
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
on
the
basis
of
systematic
exclusion
of
blacks.
they
are
really
--
it's
not
the
question
of
the
systematic
exclusion
of
blacks
as
much
as
it
is
the
systematic
exclusion
of
anybody
or
the
illegal
composition
of
the
grand
jury
of
black
has
no
more
act
to
legally
constituted
grand
jury
than
any
other
person
or
in
court.
and
such
as
in
the
chadwell,
chadwell
had
this
the
same
right
to
the
constitutional
grand
jury
that
mr.
henderson
had.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
black
defendant
who
was
indicted
in
davidson
county,
tennessee
in
1948
by
a
grand
jury
which
did
not
and
had
not
for
some
years
before,
and
did
not
for
some
years
after
include
a
member
of
black
race.
mr.
richardson
with
the
advise
and
consent
of
retained
counsel,
entered
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
accepted
a
sentence
of
99
years
in
the
state
penitentiary.
in
1964,
mr.
henderson
first
came
back
into
the
courts
when
he
attacked
or
alleged
that
his
confession
was
coerced,
and
that
his
guilty
plea
was
involuntary.
the
case
was
ultimately
heard
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
federal
district
court,
the
sixth
circuit,
denied
him
relief
and
this
court
denied
cert.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
no,
your
honor,
none.
there
was
reference
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
state
court
at
this
case
that
he
was
advised
at
that
time
that
he
could
raise
this
question
by
the
--
advised
by
the
attorney
that
represented
him
at
that
time.
the
state
court
granted
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
then
we
have
moved
to
1967.
the
state
granted
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
the
proof
as
i
have
stated
earlier
showed
that
there
had
been
no
blacks
to
serve
on
the
grand
jury
from
1922
until
1953,
when
the
first
black
was
put
on
the
davidson
county
grand
jury.
the
selection
system
from
1947
was
that
the
trial
judges,
criminal
trial
judges
would
pick
the
people
that
they
wanted
on
the
grand
jury.
there
was
no
random
selection.
the
court
denied
relief,
the
state
court
did,
and
ultimately
the
tennessee
appellate
court
said
that
he
had
waived
the
right
by
his
failure
to
object
by
plea
of
indictment,
prior
to
entering
a
plea
to
the
indictment.
the
rule
in
tennessee
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
rule
12
(b)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
for
criminal
procedure.
he
filed
a
petition,
of
course,
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court,
and
that
court
granted
the
relief
on
the
basis
of
the
conclusion
of
the
court
that
the
grand
jury
was
void,
it
therefore
rendered
a
void
indictment,
and
that
he
could
not
have
waived
it
because
no
attorney
in
tennessee
would
have
thought
of
raising
the
question
in
1948.
quoting
the
statement
from
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
about
judge
harvard
(ph),
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
indictment
was
not
void,
but
voidable,
but
under
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case
in
light
of
back
that
one
of
our
judges
had
stated,
no
lawyer
would
have
thought
of
raising
this
in
1948
that
mr.
henderson
was
entitled
to
the
relief
that
it
was
not
a
knowing
intelligent
waiver.
it
is
our
position
that
mr.
henderson
waived
his
right
to
the
taxes
twice.
once
by
entering
a
plea
at
all,
or
before
raising
it
and
the
second
time
when
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
the
first
issue
of
waiving
it,
by
failing
to
question
it
prior
to
waive
--
entering
a
plea
to
indictment,
we
follow
the
same
line
of
reasoning
generally,
that
government
did
in
the
proceeding
case.
the
court
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
petition
for
that
reason
in
the
district
court.
i
did
not
pursue
that
issue
in
there,
sorry,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
at
least
that
was
my
original
position
in
this
case.
this
court
as
has
been
stated
earlier
here
today,
has
held
that
where
a
defendant
is
convicted
as
the
result
of
some
illegal
evidence,
or
illegal
proceedings
that
went
to
the
question
or
the
issue
of
innocence
or
guilt,
that
it
must
be
knowing
intelligent
waiver.
in
this
case,
if
i
may
state
to
the
court,
this
is
typically
of
what
--
or
shall
i
say
hypothetical
situation.
here
is
a
retained
counsel.
he
has
a
client
who
is
facing
a
possible
death
penalty,
and
he
has
really
one
thing
in
mind,
the
welfare
of
his
client
theoretically.
assuming
that
this
issue
crosses
his
mind,
his
client
is
in
jail,
his
client
has
made
a
confession,
and
taking
the
feeling
of
the
times
in
1948,
has
a
pretty
chance
of
getting
the
death
penalty
or
at
least
a
reasonable
chance
of
getting
the
death
penalty.
and
the
issue
of
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
crosses
his
mind,
he
is
going
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
if
i
raise
that,
what
will
happen?
i
will
be
successful,
and
there
will
be
blacks
included
on
the
grand
jury
that
will
consider
the
re-indictment
of
him,
but
this
grand
jury
has
a
confession
in
front
of
it.
it
is
my
position,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
question
the
fact
that
in
all
likelihood
a
solid
black
grand
jury
would
have
been
indicted
him
in
the
face
of
this
confession.
now,
this
would
gain
him
additional
time
if
he
wanted
additional
time,
but
there
is
no
speculation
really
that
could
come
to
that
conclusion
in
this
case,
because
he
had
successfully
negotiated
a
plea.
he
had
agreed
apparently
successfully,
at
least
he
eliminated
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty.
the
only
other
reason
that
it
could
have
--
that
an
attorney
would
have
considered
waiving
it,
or
raising
it
at
that
time,
would
be
to
further
the
calls
of
civil
rights
on
this
particular
issue,
to
attempt
to
eliminate
this
illegal
method,
but
it
would
have
no
effect
on
his
client.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
before
a
plea
was
entered
to
the
indictment,
whether
there
be
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
just
that
there
was
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
maybe
the
record
does
not
show,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
at
this
point,
but
this
was
typically
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
there
is
no
indication
that
there
was,
your
honor.
this
would
typically
be
the
situation,
and
where
a
retained
counsel
agrees
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
for
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
the
question
of
knowing
intelligent
waiver.
i
say
in
this
case,
knowing
intelligent
waiver
took
place.
mr.
henderson's
retained
counsel,
apparently
and
obviously
discussed
it,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
he
--
and
this
was
raised
by
mr.
henderson
in
an
earlier
thing
that
his
attorney,
or
that
he
reluctantly
did
it,
but
that
his
attorney
talked
to
him
in
to
entering
a
plea
of
guilty.
they
have
talked
about
this,
and
they
have
finally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
is
the
best
thing.
at
this
point,
i
think
mr.
henderson
do,
and
i
think
the
record,
and
the
entire
record
in
these
proceedings
support
this,
that
from
that
moment
on
he
had
no
more
standing
in
court,
that
he
was
facing
a
term
of
99
years,
that
he
had
eliminated
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty,
that
the
proceedings
were
over.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
over
for
him
for
some
16
years,
before
he
ever
came
back
to
court
for
anything.
the
evidence
or
the
circumstantial
evidence
points
to
the
fact
that
he
knew,
and
the
court
has
found
earlier
that
it
was
a
voluntary
plea
of
guilty.
that
he
knew
at
the
time
he
entered
death
plea,
that
this
was
end
of
the
proceedings.
i
am
sure
that
he
did
not
know
constitutional
law,
that
he
had
numerous
rights
which
many
of
us
spent
years
studying
those
particular
hearings
in
law
schools,
and
after
we
are
out
too.
there
is
no
evidence,
and
i
could
admit
candidly
to
this
court
that
i
am
sure
that
it
did
not
happen,
that
these
were
discussed
with
him.
i
dare
say
that
there
is
a
prisoner
in
a
penal
institutions
in
tennessee
who
knows
all
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
very
few
lawyers,
but
here
is
plea
of
guilty,
was
knowing,
intelligent,
and
that
he
knew
the
consequences
of
it.
he
knew
that
he
has
had
his
day
in
court,
and
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
line.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
30
years.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
the
same,
any
penalties
you
are
entitled
in
a
maximum
of
30
years.
as
there
was
some
question
about
whether
the
guilty
plea
was
raised,
the
voluntariness
of
guilty
plea.
this
question
was
raised
earlier
it
was
decided
in
the
case
of
henderson,
the
henderson
in
sixth
circuit
number
1785
in
1968
and
cert
was
denied
in
391
us
927
by
this
court.
according
to
the
list
that
is
in
my
petition
for
certiorari,
the
appendix
of
page
2a
in
the
footnotes
to
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
in
those
early
or
pro
se
petitions
he
did
claim
that
his
confession
had
been
coerced
and
that
his
guilty
of
plea
was
therefore
involuntary.
he
also
asserted
that
he
had
been
denied
the
assistance
of
counsel.
the
district
court
considered
these
claims
and
decided
they
might
virtually
on
the
merits
we
affirm.
the
question
of
impaneling
a
jury
to
impose
sentence,
this
is
done
in
tennessee
as
it
might
appear
to
be
somewhat
of
a
fiction,
where
there
will
be
a
negotiated
plea,
a
jury
is
impaneled,
the
situation
is
presented
to
the
jury
typically
by
the
district
attorney
general.
he
says,
it
is
the
recommendation
of
the
state
and
we
have
agreed
to
a
number
of
years,
being
99,
the
jury
walks
out
and
comes
back
in
and
back
at
that
time,
many
times
there
was
evidence,
some
evidence
introduced
to
the
jury
even
though
there
was
a
guilty
plea.
this
is
not
necessary
now,
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
necessary
then
but
at
any
rate
it
was
done
and
it
has
been
done
in
recent
years
and
has
been
practice
throughout.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
please
the
court
that
is
the
problem
i
have
never
been
faced
with.
i
say
typically
when
it
is
presented
to
whom
that
it
the
guilty
plea
is
going
in
for
99
years
sentence,
do
you
agree
with
that,
that
is
about
the
way
it
is
presented
to
the
jury.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
and
the
jury
in
the
cases
that
i
have
been
involved
in
always
came
back
and
did
what
the
judge
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
well
not
necessarily
i
have
seen
them,
as
i
recall
now
and
i
did
not
realize
we
had
get
into
this
i
have
seen
them,
if
they
say
so
you
all
and
will
you
raise
your
hand.
now
that
i
am
refreshing
my
memory
on
it.
i
would
like
to
bring
up,
the
parker
case
was
brought
up,
i
am
sure
this
court
is
aware
of
it,
but
the
four
circuit
did
deny
parker
relief
in
december
of
this
past
year
on
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
on
the
same
issue
that
is
presented
here
today
and
relied
on
the
trilogy
richardson
versus
mcmann,
brady
and
parker
previously
decided
by
this
court.
the
number
of
that
in
that
court
is
in
71-1925
parker
versus
ross.
this
is
not
--
i
would
like
to
reiterate
further
or
in
answer
to
mr.
hoefle,
this
is
not
similar
to
noia
or
johnson
or
there
is
a
distinguishing
characteristic
that
is
one
that
he
knowingly
intelligently
made
a
guilty
plea
knowing
the
consequences
of
it,
had
his
day
in
court
and
knew
that
it
was
over
and
number
two
the
constitutional
error
alleged
in
this
case
did
not
go
to
the
innocence
or
guilt
and
was
a
matter
that
was
curable
at
that
time,
but
that
is
not
curable
at
this
time.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
the
record
does
not
say
that.
the
lawyer
filed
an
affidavit
in
this
record.
he
said
i
did
not
know
that
blacks
systematically
excluded
in
1948.
i
did
not
know
that
on
the
grand
jury
i
do
not
know
today
that
they
were
excluded.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
no
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
i
am
sure
--
i
mean
i
have
to
concede
that
this
was
not
discussed
and
from
the
record
was
not
entertained
in
the
mind
of
the
the
attorney
or
the
defendant,
mr.
henderson
at
that
time.
i
say
it
is
knowing
intelligent
waiver
even
though
they
did
not
directly
say
we
don't
waive
this
he
knew
that
he
was
waiving
everything.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
knowing
intelligent
plea
of
guilty
and
that
it
was
a
conclusion
of
his
proceeding.
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
waiver
to
right
--
mr.
r.
jackson
rose
yes,
your
honor
in
a
curable
defect
that
existed
at
this
time.
his
affidavit
was
just
that
he
had
no
knowledge
that
they
were
excluded
at
that
time
from
the
grand
jury,
from
the
petit
jury
on
page
895
of
the
appendix
and
a96.
he
did
not
say
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
right
to
attack
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
on
the
basis
of
systematic
exclusion
of
blacks.
they
are
really
--
it's
not
the
question
of
the
systematic
exclusion
of
blacks
as
much
as
it
is
the
systematic
exclusion
of
anybody
or
the
illegal
composition
of
the
grand
jury
of
black
has
no
more
act
to
legally
constituted
grand
jury
than
any
other
person
or
in
court.
and
such
as
in
the
chadwell,
chadwell
had
this
the
same
right
to
the
constitutional
grand
jury
that
mr.
henderson
had.
