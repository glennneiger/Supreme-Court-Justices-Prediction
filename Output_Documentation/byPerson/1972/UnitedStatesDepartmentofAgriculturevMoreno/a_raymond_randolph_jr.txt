mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
three
judge
federal
district
court
in
district
of
columbia,
holding
section
3
of
the
food
stamp
act
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
insofar
as
it
limits
eligibility
for
food
stamps
to
related
households.
the
court
enjoined
the
secretary
of
agriculture
from
denying
eligibility
to
households
containing
one
or
more
unrelated
individuals.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
3
of
the
food
stamp
act
is
so
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
will
first
give
a
brief
description
of
the
food
stamp
act,
then
deal
with
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
and
then
discuss
our
position.
the
food
stamp
program
was
enacted
in
1964
to
raise
the
nutritional
level
of
low
income
households
and
to
strengthen
the
agricultural
economy.
eligibility
to
participate
in
the
program
is
on
a
household
basis,
rather
than
on
an
individual,
although
an
individual
can
comprise
a
household
if
living
alone.
an
eligible
household
exchanges
an
amount
of
money
for
what
is
termed
an
allotment
of
food
stamps
or
coupons
of
a
higher
monetary
value.
the
difference
between
what
the
household
actually
pays
for
the
coupons
and
their
actual
value
is
the
federal
contributions
to
the
household's
increased
purchasing
power.
the
household
uses
these
coupons
to
purchase
food
at
the
prevailing
price
in
participating
retails
stores.
the
retailer
redeems
the
coupons
through
the
commercial
banking
system.
the
amount
of
allotment
to
a
household
is
determined
by
the
household
size.
for
example,
at
present,
a
household
of
four
persons
is
alloted
a
$112
a
month;
a
household
of
five,
a
$132
and
so
forth
and
new
allotment
levels
coming
to
effect
each
year
and
i
am
told
that
38
federal
register,
8287;
the
new
allotment
levels
effective
july
1,
1973
are
printed.
the
amount
of
money
a
household
must
exchange
for
it
is
coupon
allotment
depends
on
the
household's
monthly
net
income.
for
example,
a
household
of
four,
with
$250
monthly
net
income
must
pay
$71
for
this,
$112
allotment
of
coupons.
if
the
net
income
to
the
household
is
$330,
the
household
pays
$86
for
a
$112
coupons
and
so
forth.
the
food
stamp
program
is
not
a
mandatory
program,
it
is
a
joint
federal,
state
and
local
government
undertaking.
counties
and
independent
cities
as
well
as
states
have
the
option
whether
or
not
to
participate
in
the
program.
at
present,
all
but
about
one-third
of
the
counties
and
cities
in
the
country
have
food
stamp
programs,
that
is
2,204
out
of
3,129
have
food
stamp
programs.
three
states,
nevada,
delaware
and
new
hampshire
have
no
food
stamp
program
whatsoever.
while
the
federal
government
pays
for
the
increased
food
purchasing
power
of
the
household
and
sets
uniform
national
standards
of
eligibility,
the
day-to-day
administration
of
the
program
is
handled
largely
by
state
agencies
to
certify
households
as
eligible,
investigate
applications,
issue
the
stamps
and
so
forth.
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
administrative
costs
are
paid
for
by
the
state
out
of
it
is
own
pocket.
section
3
of
the
act,
the
statue
at
issue
in
this
case,
defines
the
term
household
for
eligibility
purposes
as
“a
group
of
related
individuals
or
non-related
individuals
over
age
60,
who
are
living
as
one
economic
unit,
sharing
common
cooking
facilities
and
for
whom
home
food
is
customarily
purchased
in
common.
appellees

live
with
unrelated
persons

that
because
section
3(e)
limits
eligibility
to
groups
of
related
individuals,
a
provision
that
resorted

the
act,

has

of

fifth
amendment.

on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
to
district
court
held
at
section
3(e),
by
extending
food
stamp
eligibility
only
to
related
households,
discriminates
against
persons
and
groups
containing
unrelated
individuals
such
as
the
appellees
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
court
said
that
it
was
unable
to
perceive
any
rational
basis
for
congress'
making
only
related
households
eligible
and
thus,
not
including
unrelated
households
as
well
in
eligibility
for
food
stamps.
in
discussing
this
question,
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
what
class
exactly
is
it
that
is
affected
by
this.
as
we
said
the
bar
section
3
is
definition
of
household
as
a
related
group
for
individuals.
on
page
12,
the
appellees
define
the
class
as,
page
12
of
their
briefs,
the
white
copy,
as
composed
of
persons
in
need
of
food
stamps
as
are
related
household
members,
but
who
live
in
households
that
include
one
or
more
persons
who
are
unrelated
to
everyone
else
in
that
household.
this
is
not
an
accurate
description
of
the
class
that
is
ineligible
for
food
stamps
under
section
3(e).
first
of
all,
for
purposes
of
section
3(e),
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
if
unrelated
persons,
60
years
old
or
older
are
living
in
the
household,
in
otherwise,
eligible
household
does
not
disqualify.
second,
if
there
are
children,
by
regulation
second,
if
there
are
children
under
the
age
of
18,
but
not
related
to
any
of
the
adult
members
of
the
household
or
not
even
legally
adopted
or
assigned
through
a
foster
home,
the
household
does
not
render
ineligible
so
long
as
one
of
the
parents
performs
the
duty
or
one
of
the
adults
performs
the
duties
of
a
parent
with
respect
to
such
children.
third,
even
if
a
man
and
woman,
this
is
again
by
regulations,
are
living
together
and
not
married
or
related,
they
can
still
comprise
an
eligible
household
so
long
as
they
are
treated
by
the
community
as
husband
and
wife.
this
regulation
is
sort
of
a
federal
common
law
of
marriage.
fourth
and
perhaps
most
significant,
even
if
none
of
these
examples
apply,
unrelated
persons
living
together
are
not
automatically
ineligible
for
food
stamps.
as
we
noted
in
pages
9
through
11
of
our
reply
brief,
the
recent
decision
in
the
district
court
in
california
knowles
versus
butz,
which
the
department
of
agriculture,
it's
at
page
9
through
11,
we
discussed
this
case
and
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
holds,
the
knowles
decision
holds
that
even
if
people
live
in
the
same
house
or
apartment
and
share
housing
expenses,
they
are
not
necessarily
one
household
for
purposes
of
eligibility
because
in
under
the
act
in
order
to
be
considered
a
household,
the
group
of
persons
must
operate
as
an
economic
unit.
that
is
common
living
expenses
must
be
shared
in
the
income
of
all,
the
needs
of
all
members
have
to
be
provided
without
regard
to
a
willingness
--
willingness
or
ability
to
pay.
for
example
if
two
unrelated
founders
move
in
together
and
share
only
housing
expenses,
they
could
be
considered
two
related
households
instead
of
one
unrelated
household.
perhaps
mrs
keppler
might
serve
as
an
example.
her
situation
is
reported
on
pages
26
to
27
of
the
appendix
and
she
alleges
that
she
moved
in
with
another
woman
in
order
to
save
housing
expenses.
there
is
no
indication
that
there’s
a
general
pooling
or
sharing
of
all
resources
without
regard
to
willingness
to
contribute
or
pay.
in
our
brief
we
through
the
analogy
that
just
simply
because
two
lawyers
for
example
share
an
office,
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
necessarily
partners
even
if
they
both
share
the
expenses
for
that.
i
think
there
are
numerous
other
examples
of
this.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
sorry
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
would
be
ineligible
because
then.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
would
then
be
one
economic
unit
and
thereafter
not
to
separate
households
living
together
but
one
household
and
therefore
unrelated.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
difference
is
that
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
but
if
they
didn’t
pooled
their
resource
they
would
be
eligible.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes
because
the
statute
requires
mr.
justice
is
that
the
group
of
persons
live
as
an
economic
unit.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no
they
children,
mrs
keppler
has
two
children.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
an
individual
can
comprise
a
household
under
the
act.
if
the
individual
is
not
a
part
of
any
other
economic
unit,
it
can
comprise
a
household.
i
am
sorry,
i
ought
to
expand
on
this.
under
section
3(e)
the
term
household
means
either
a
single
individual
or
a
group
of
individuals
living
related
individuals,
living
as
one
economic
unit.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
we
are
talking
about
both
groups
and
individuals.
some
of
the
appellee
are
individuals.
the
only
appellee
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
but
she
has
two
children,
she
would
be
qualified
as
a
household
if
she
shared
only
living,
only
housing
expenses.
the
fact
that
she
lives
under
the
same
roof
with
another
woman
would
not
mean
that,
that
was
an
economic
unit
composed
of
mrs,
keppler
and
the
other
woman.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
would
depend
on
what
her
income
was
and
i
think
she
is
on
welfare,
if
she
is
then
she
would
be
eligible
too,
but
they
would
be
eligible
as
separate
households
not
as
one
household.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
difference
would
be
simply
zero
federal
contribution
to
food
purchasing
power
as
opposed
to
whatever
the
food
purchasing
power
would
be?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right,
i
have
wanted
to
give
an
accurate
definition
of
what
class
people
of
were
affected
by
this
and
it's
not
accurate
to
say
that
simply
because
two
unrelated
people
are
living
together
they
are
disqualified
from
receiving
food
stamps.
that
is
not
an
accurate
description
of
class,
that
is
not
necessarily
so
unless
they
are
living
as
an
economic
unit
pooling
all
resources.
prior
to
1971
both
related
and
unrelated
households
were
eligible
for
food
stamp
relief.
during
1969,
1970,
however,
before
the
program's
organization
for
preparation
inspired
and
the
food
stamp
gets
an
authorization
every
year
on
a
present
practice
since
reevaluated,
congress
too
undertook
a
comprehensive
reevaluation
of
the
program's
operation.
as
representative
foley
stated
on
the
house
floor,
there
was
congressional
concern
about
participation
in
the
program
by
what
he
termed
“collections
of
essentially
unrelated
individuals
who
voluntarily
choose
to
cohabit
and
live
of
food
stamps.”
the
congress
had
evidence
during
the
hearings
that
at
lease
in
one
food
stamp
jurisdiction
38.6%
of
the
non
assistance
households
were
either
groups
of
college
students
living
as
fraternities
and
42.4%
of
the
non
assistance
households
were
groups
of
unrelated
individuals
who
joined
together
to
adopt
the
communal
life
style.
the
revision
of
section
3(e)
by
the
conference
committee
dealt
with
this
problem
by
extending
food
stamp
relief
only
to
related
households.
and
we
believe
this
is
an
example
of
what
the
quote
spoke
about
in
williamson
and
lee
optical
and
dandridge
and
williams
and
jefferson
and
hackney
of
congress
permissively
selecting
one
face
of
the
problem,
in
this
case
related
households,
and
applying
a
remedy
there.
we
submit
congress
had
rational
basis
for
doing
this
and
therefore
did
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
and
allocating
assistance
among
potential
recipients,
congress
could
irrationally,
and
indeed
probably
must,
follow
some
scale
of
priorities
in
determining
need.
in
following
the
scale
of
priorities
we
think
it
was
quite
irrational
for
congress
to
say
that
communal
groups
such
as
the
kind
described
by
congressman
foley
would
rank
very
low
in
the
scale
of
priorities
as
opposed
to
people
that
were
in
need
out
of
circumstances
that
were
not
of
their
control.
and
congress
could
therefore,
we
believe,
decide
not
extend
relief
beyond
related
households
because
to
do
so
would
encompass
the
kinds
of
groups
the
congressman
foley
spoke
about
on
house
floor,
that
is
communal
groups
and
also
college
fraternities
that
were
living
of
food
stamps.
this
kind
of
allocation
i
think
is
illustrated
by
dandridge
and
williams
where
the
court
said
that
the
constitution
does
empower
this
court
to
second
guest
officials
charged
with
a
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
limited
public
welfare
funds
among
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
we
think
there
was
an
additional
reason
why
congress
could
conclude
that
it
was
proper
only
aid
related
households.
congress
knew
the
relative
instability
of
groups
of
unrelated
individuals
as
compared
with
related
household
as
this
could
cause
administrative
difficulties
because
household
eligibilities
since
the
allotment
for
month,
it
must
be
determined
on
a
continuing
basis.
the
certification
of
the
household
depends
on
how
stable
the
household
is,
if
it's
a
very
unstable
household
with
different
income
coming
in
with
different
people
living
in
it,
there
must
be
a
constant
certification
of
determine
it's
allotment.
this
increased
administrative
expenses,
something
that
we
think
additionally
served
as
rational
basis
for
congress'
classification
as
it
did.
and
i
refer
now
to
page
45
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
letter
that
appellees
had
included
in
the
record.
as
i
said
before
the
food
stamp
program
is
an
optional
program,
it's
not
mandatory,
about
one
third
of
the
counties
in
the
country
don't
have
a
food
stamp
program,
at
the
top
of

raymond
randolph,
jr.
he
says
counties
are
carefully
considering
the
increased
cost
of
administration
very
carefully.
several
counties
have
indicated
that
they
are
weighing
the
possibilities
of
changing
from
food
stamp
programs
to
commodities
or
of
having
no
supplemental
food
program
at
all.
new
counties
just
accepted
and
not
operating
they
reevaluate
their
decision
to
come
into
this
program.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
california.
i
think
congress
knew
this
as
well
as
the
director
of
the
california
services
and
new
york
--
and
they
also
knew
that
by
having
related
households
in
the
program
they
can
increase
the
administrative
cost.
now
for
rational
basis
means,
a
basis
derived
from
reasoning,
we
think
this
statute
meets
that
test.
as
i
said
before
there
are
groups
within
the
unrelated
households
group
that
congress
reasonably
i
think
and
certainly
rationally
could
conclude
were
not
deserving
a
food
stamp
on
any
kind
of
scale
of
priorities
that
congress
could
follow.
and
second
of
all
by
including
unrelated
households
congress
could
also
conclude
that
it
would
create
increased
administrative
expense
was
may
in
fact
deter
states
or
counties
from
adopting
the
program
at
all.
it's
no
answer
to
say
of
this
as
appellees
do,
well,
there
are
other
ways
of
taking
care
of
these
problems.
for
example,
we
have
criminal
sanctions
and
in
1971,
congress
added
a
requirement
that
people
must
register
and
for
accept
employment
as
a
condition
to
food
stamp
relief.
the
very
harshness
of
the
criminal
penalties
for
abuses
suggest
this
use
and
there
was
testimony
on
the
house
floor
that
it
was
not
an
effective
remedy
and
the
work
requirement
which
requires
adult
numbers
of
the
household,
the
register
for
and
accept
employment
had
just
been
added
to
the
act
simultaneously
with
the
revision
of
section
3(e).
this
was
thus
new
and
untried
and
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
administrative
difficulties
it
had
in
controlling
this
nationwide
program
under
the
existing
practices.
it
surely
was
not
required
to
assume
that
the
constitution
forbid
it
from
extending
relief
only
to
related
households
because
it
just
added
a
work
provision
to
the
act
which
was
yet
untried.
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
might
have
been
other
ways
for
congress
to
respond
to
these
problems,
but
that
section
3(e)
is
the
best
approach
or
even
a
wise
one.
but
as
the
court
is
continually
reminded
the
wisdom
or
i
might
add,
the
unwisdom
of
a
particular
statutory
is
not
a
proper
subject
subject
for
judicial
inquiry.
we
believe
congress
had
rational
base
for
extending
relief
only
to
related
households
and
the
fifth
amendment
requires
no
more.
we
therefore
believe
that
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
it
is
because,
of
course
if
unrelated
groups
are
eligible
and
the
fact
that
they
are
getting
food
stamps
is
not
an
abuse
of
the
program.
it's
only
an
abuse
if
you
define
your
priorities
to
such
as
to
say
that
these
are
people
that
are
very
low
in
the
scale
and
that
we
ought
to
concentrate
our
efforts
else
where.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
that's
it,
that's
it.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
three
judge
federal
district
court
in
district
of
columbia,
holding
section
3
of
the
food
stamp
act
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
insofar
as
it
limits
eligibility
for
food
stamps
to
related
households.
the
court
enjoined
the
secretary
of
agriculture
from
denying
eligibility
to
households
containing
one
or
more
unrelated
individuals.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
3
of
the
food
stamp
act
is
so
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
will
first
give
a
brief
description
of
the
food
stamp
act,
then
deal
with
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
and
then
discuss
our
position.
the
food
stamp
program
was
enacted
in
1964
to
raise
the
nutritional
level
of
low
income
households
and
to
strengthen
the
agricultural
economy.
eligibility
to
participate
in
the
program
is
on
a
household
basis,
rather
than
on
an
individual,
although
an
individual
can
comprise
a
household
if
living
alone.
an
eligible
household
exchanges
an
amount
of
money
for
what
is
termed
an
allotment
of
food
stamps
or
coupons
of
a
higher
monetary
value.
the
difference
between
what
the
household
actually
pays
for
the
coupons
and
their
actual
value
is
the
federal
contributions
to
the
household's
increased
purchasing
power.
the
household
uses
these
coupons
to
purchase
food
at
the
prevailing
price
in
participating
retails
stores.
the
retailer
redeems
the
coupons
through
the
commercial
banking
system.
the
amount
of
allotment
to
a
household
is
determined
by
the
household
size.
for
example,
at
present,
a
household
of
four
persons
is
alloted
a
$112
a
month;
a
household
of
five,
a
$132
and
so
forth
and
new
allotment
levels
coming
to
effect
each
year
and
i
am
told
that
38
federal
register,
8287;
the
new
allotment
levels
effective
july
1,
1973
are
printed.
the
amount
of
money
a
household
must
exchange
for
it
is
coupon
allotment
depends
on
the
household's
monthly
net
income.
for
example,
a
household
of
four,
with
$250
monthly
net
income
must
pay
$71
for
this,
$112
allotment
of
coupons.
if
the
net
income
to
the
household
is
$330,
the
household
pays
$86
for
a
$112
coupons
and
so
forth.
the
food
stamp
program
is
not
a
mandatory
program,
it
is
a
joint
federal,
state
and
local
government
undertaking.
counties
and
independent
cities
as
well
as
states
have
the
option
whether
or
not
to
participate
in
the
program.
at
present,
all
but
about
one-third
of
the
counties
and
cities
in
the
country
have
food
stamp
programs,
that
is
2,204
out
of
3,129
have
food
stamp
programs.
three
states,
nevada,
delaware
and
new
hampshire
have
no
food
stamp
program
whatsoever.
while
the
federal
government
pays
for
the
increased
food
purchasing
power
of
the
household
and
sets
uniform
national
standards
of
eligibility,
the
day-to-day
administration
of
the
program
is
handled
largely
by
state
agencies
to
certify
households
as
eligible,
investigate
applications,
issue
the
stamps
and
so
forth.
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
administrative
costs
are
paid
for
by
the
state
out
of
it
is
own
pocket.
section
3
of
the
act,
the
statue
at
issue
in
this
case,
defines
the
term
household
for
eligibility
purposes
as
“a
group
of
related
individuals
or
non-related
individuals
over
age
60,
who
are
living
as
one
economic
unit,
sharing
common
cooking
facilities
and
for
whom
home
food
is
customarily
purchased
in
common.
appellees
who
live
with
unrelated
persons
claim
that
because
section
3(e)
limits
eligibility
to
groups
of
related
individuals,
a
provision
that
resorted
from
1971
amendments
to
the
act,
congress
has
deprived
them
of
food
stamps
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
brought
this
class
action
seeking
a
declaration
that
section
3(e)
is
unconstitutional
and
an
injunction
--
and
seeking
also
an
injunction
against
its
operation.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened.
each

the
five
individual
appellees
or
groups
of

that

on

for
summary
judgment,
to
district
court
held
at
section
3(e),
by
extending
food
stamp
eligibility
only
to
related
households,
discriminates
against
persons
and
groups
containing
unrelated
individuals
such
as
the
appellees
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
court
said
that
it
was
unable
to
perceive
any
rational
basis
for
congress'
making
only
related
households
eligible
and
thus,
not
including
unrelated
households
as
well
in
eligibility
for
food
stamps.
in
discussing
this
question,
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
what
class
exactly
is
it
that
is
affected
by
this.
as
we
said
the
bar
section
3
is
definition
of
household
as
a
related
group
for
individuals.
on
page
12,
the
appellees
define
the
class
as,
page
12
of
their
briefs,
the
white
copy,
as
composed
of
persons
in
need
of
food
stamps
as
are
related
household
members,
but
who
live
in
households
that
include
one
or
more
persons
who
are
unrelated
to
everyone
else
in
that
household.
this
is
not
an
accurate
description
of
the
class
that
is
ineligible
for
food
stamps
under
section
3(e).
first
of
all,
for
purposes
of
section
3(e),
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
if
unrelated
persons,
60
years
old
or
older
are
living
in
the
household,
in
otherwise,
eligible
household
does
not
disqualify.
second,
if
there
are
children,
by
regulation
second,
if
there
are
children
under
the
age
of
18,
but
not
related
to
any
of
the
adult
members
of
the
household
or
not
even
legally
adopted
or
assigned
through
a
foster
home,
the
household
does
not
render
ineligible
so
long
as
one
of
the
parents
performs
the
duty
or
one
of
the
adults
performs
the
duties
of
a
parent
with
respect
to
such
children.
third,
even
if
a
man
and
woman,
this
is
again
by
regulations,
are
living
together
and
not
married
or
related,
they
can
still
comprise
an
eligible
household
so
long
as
they
are
treated
by
the
community
as
husband
and
wife.
this
regulation
is
sort
of
a
federal
common
law
of
marriage.
fourth
and
perhaps
most
significant,
even
if
none
of
these
examples
apply,
unrelated
persons
living
together
are
not
automatically
ineligible
for
food
stamps.
as
we
noted
in
pages
9
through
11
of
our
reply
brief,
the
recent
decision
in
the
district
court
in
california
knowles
versus
butz,
which
the
department
of
agriculture,
it's
at
page
9
through
11,
we
discussed
this
case
and
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
holds,
the
knowles
decision
holds
that
even
if
people
live
in
the
same
house
or
apartment
and
share
housing
expenses,
they
are
not
necessarily
one
household
for
purposes
of
eligibility
because
in
under
the
act
in
order
to
be
considered
a
household,
the
group
of
persons
must
operate
as
an
economic
unit.
that
is
common
living
expenses
must
be
shared
in
the
income
of
all,
the
needs
of
all
members
have
to
be
provided
without
regard
to
a
willingness
--
willingness
or
ability
to
pay.
for
example
if
two
unrelated
founders
move
in
together
and
share
only
housing
expenses,
they
could
be
considered
two
related
households
instead
of
one
unrelated
household.
perhaps
mrs
keppler
might
serve
as
an
example.
her
situation
is
reported
on
pages
26
to
27
of
the
appendix
and
she
alleges
that
she
moved
in
with
another
woman
in
order
to
save
housing
expenses.
there
is
no
indication
that
there’s
a
general
pooling
or
sharing
of
all
resources
without
regard
to
willingness
to
contribute
or
pay.
in
our
brief
we
through
the
analogy
that
just
simply
because
two
lawyers
for
example
share
an
office,
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
necessarily
partners
even
if
they
both
share
the
expenses
for
that.
i
think
there
are
numerous
other
examples
of
this.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
sorry
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
would
be
ineligible
because
then.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
would
then
be
one
economic
unit
and
thereafter
not
to
separate
households
living
together
but
one
household
and
therefore
unrelated.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
difference
is
that
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
but
if
they
didn’t
pooled
their
resource
they
would
be
eligible.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes
because
the
statute
requires
mr.
justice
is
that
the
group
of
persons
live
as
an
economic
unit.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no
they
children,
mrs
keppler
has
two
children.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
an
individual
can
comprise
a
household
under
the
act.
if
the
individual
is
not
a
part
of
any
other
economic
unit,
it
can
comprise
a
household.
i
am
sorry,
i
ought
to
expand
on
this.
under
section
3(e)
the
term
household
means
either
a
single
individual
or
a
group
of
individuals
living
related
individuals,
living
as
one
economic
unit.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
we
are
talking
about
both
groups
and
individuals.
some
of
the
appellee
are
individuals.
the
only
appellee
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
but
she
has
two
children,
she
would
be
qualified
as
a
household
if
she
shared
only
living,
only
housing
expenses.
the
fact
that
she
lives
under
the
same
roof
with
another
woman
would
not
mean
that,
that
was
an
economic
unit
composed
of
mrs,
keppler
and
the
other
woman.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
would
depend
on
what
her
income
was
and
i
think
she
is
on
welfare,
if
she
is
then
she
would
be
eligible
too,
but
they
would
be
eligible
as
separate
households
not
as
one
household.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
difference
would
be
simply
zero
federal
contribution
to
food
purchasing
power
as
opposed
to
whatever
the
food
purchasing
power
would
be?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right,
i
have
wanted
to
give
an
accurate
definition
of
what
class
people
of
were
affected
by
this
and
it's
not
accurate
to
say
that
simply
because
two
unrelated
people
are
living
together
they
are
disqualified
from
receiving
food
stamps.
that
is
not
an
accurate
description
of
class,
that
is
not
necessarily
so
unless
they
are
living
as
an
economic
unit
pooling
all
resources.
prior
to
1971
both
related
and
unrelated
households
were
eligible
for
food
stamp
relief.
during
1969,
1970,
however,
before
the
program's
organization
for
preparation
inspired
and
the
food
stamp
gets
an
authorization
every
year
on
a
present
practice
since
reevaluated,
congress
too
undertook
a
comprehensive
reevaluation
of
the
program's
operation.
as
representative
foley
stated
on
the
house
floor,
there
was
congressional
concern
about
participation
in
the
program
by
what
he
termed
“collections
of
essentially
unrelated
individuals
who
voluntarily
choose
to
cohabit
and
live
of
food
stamps.”
the
congress
had
evidence
during
the
hearings
that
at
lease
in
one
food
stamp
jurisdiction
38.6%
of
the
non
assistance
households
were
either
groups
of
college
students
living
as
fraternities
and
42.4%
of
the
non
assistance
households
were
groups
of
unrelated
individuals
who
joined
together
to
adopt
the
communal
life
style.
the
revision
of
section
3(e)
by
the
conference
committee
dealt
with
this
problem
by
extending
food
stamp
relief
only
to
related
households.
and
we
believe
this
is
an
example
of
what
the
quote
spoke
about
in
williamson
and
lee
optical
and
dandridge
and
williams
and
jefferson
and
hackney
of
congress
permissively
selecting
one
face
of
the
problem,
in
this
case
related
households,
and
applying
a
remedy
there.
we
submit
congress
had
rational
basis
for
doing
this
and
therefore
did
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
and
allocating
assistance
among
potential
recipients,
congress
could
irrationally,
and
indeed
probably
must,
follow
some
scale
of
priorities
in
determining
need.
in
following
the
scale
of
priorities
we
think
it
was
quite
irrational
for
congress
to
say
that
communal
groups
such
as
the
kind
described
by
congressman
foley
would
rank
very
low
in
the
scale
of
priorities
as
opposed
to
people
that
were
in
need
out
of
circumstances
that
were
not
of
their
control.
and
congress
could
therefore,
we
believe,
decide
not
extend
relief
beyond
related
households
because
to
do
so
would
encompass
the
kinds
of
groups
the
congressman
foley
spoke
about
on
house
floor,
that
is
communal
groups
and
also
college
fraternities
that
were
living
of
food
stamps.
this
kind
of
allocation
i
think
is
illustrated
by
dandridge
and
williams
where
the
court
said
that
the
constitution
does
empower
this
court
to
second
guest
officials
charged
with
a
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
limited
public
welfare
funds
among
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
we
think
there
was
an
additional
reason
why
congress
could
conclude
that
it
was
proper
only
aid
related
households.
congress
knew
the
relative
instability
of
groups
of
unrelated
individuals
as
compared
with
related
household
as
this
could
cause
administrative
difficulties
because
household
eligibilities
since
the
allotment
for
month,
it
must
be
determined
on
a
continuing
basis.
the
certification
of
the
household
depends
on
how
stable
the
household
is,
if
it's
a
very
unstable
household
with
different
income
coming
in
with
different
people
living
in
it,
there
must
be
a
constant
certification
of
determine
it's
allotment.
this
increased
administrative
expenses,
something
that
we
think
additionally
served
as
rational
basis
for
congress'
classification
as
it
did.
and
i
refer
now
to
page
45
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
letter
that
appellees
had
included
in
the
record.
as
i
said
before
the
food
stamp
program
is
an
optional
program,
it's
not
mandatory,
about
one
third
of
the
counties
in
the
country
don't
have
a
food
stamp
program,
at
the
top
of
page
45
the
director
of
the
program
for
californian

of
the
brown
appendix.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
he
says
counties
are
carefully
considering
the
increased
cost
of
administration
very
carefully.
several
counties
have
indicated
that
they
are
weighing
the
possibilities
of
changing
from
food
stamp
programs
to
commodities
or
of
having
no
supplemental
food
program
at
all.
new
counties
just
accepted
and
not
operating
they
reevaluate
their
decision
to
come
into
this
program.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
california.
i
think
congress
knew
this
as
well
as
the
director
of
the
california
services
and
new
york
--
and
they
also
knew
that
by
having
related
households
in
the
program
they
can
increase
the
administrative
cost.
now
for
rational
basis
means,
a
basis
derived
from
reasoning,
we
think
this
statute
meets
that
test.
as
i
said
before
there
are
groups
within
the
unrelated
households
group
that
congress
reasonably
i
think
and
certainly
rationally
could
conclude
were
not
deserving
a
food
stamp
on
any
kind
of
scale
of
priorities
that
congress
could
follow.
and
second
of
all
by
including
unrelated
households
congress
could
also
conclude
that
it
would
create
increased
administrative
expense
was
may
in
fact
deter
states
or
counties
from
adopting
the
program
at
all.
it's
no
answer
to
say
of
this
as
appellees
do,
well,
there
are
other
ways
of
taking
care
of
these
problems.
for
example,
we
have
criminal
sanctions
and
in
1971,
congress
added
a
requirement
that
people
must
register
and
for
accept
employment
as
a
condition
to
food
stamp
relief.
the
very
harshness
of
the
criminal
penalties
for
abuses
suggest
this
use
and
there
was
testimony
on
the
house
floor
that
it
was
not
an
effective
remedy
and
the
work
requirement
which
requires
adult
numbers
of
the
household,
the
register
for
and
accept
employment
had
just
been
added
to
the
act
simultaneously
with
the
revision
of
section
3(e).
this
was
thus
new
and
untried
and
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
administrative
difficulties
it
had
in
controlling
this
nationwide
program
under
the
existing
practices.
it
surely
was
not
required
to
assume
that
the
constitution
forbid
it
from
extending
relief
only
to
related
households
because
it
just
added
a
work
provision
to
the
act
which
was
yet
untried.
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
might
have
been
other
ways
for
congress
to
respond
to
these
problems,
but
that
section
3(e)
is
the
best
approach
or
even
a
wise
one.
but
as
the
court
is
continually
reminded
the
wisdom
or
i
might
add,
the
unwisdom
of
a
particular
statutory
is
not
a
proper
subject
subject
for
judicial
inquiry.
we
believe
congress
had
rational
base
for
extending
relief
only
to
related
households
and
the
fifth
amendment
requires
no
more.
we
therefore
believe
that
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
it
is
because,
of
course
if
unrelated
groups
are
eligible
and
the
fact
that
they
are
getting
food
stamps
is
not
an
abuse
of
the
program.
it's
only
an
abuse
if
you
define
your
priorities
to
such
as
to
say
that
these
are
people
that
are
very
low
in
the
scale
and
that
we
ought
to
concentrate
our
efforts
else
where.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
that's
it,
that's
it.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
have
nothing
further.
