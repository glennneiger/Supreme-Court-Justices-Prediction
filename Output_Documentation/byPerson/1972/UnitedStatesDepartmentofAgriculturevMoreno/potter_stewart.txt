justice
potter
stewart
you
--
i
want
to
try
and
understand
you.
you
say
the
basic
rationally
is
three
--
has
at
least
three
ingredients
as
i
understood.
first
of
all
the
–
their
concern
was
to
see
to
it
that
the
food
stamps
did
go
to
the
so
called
voluntary
poor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
secondly
it
also
has
the
ingredient
of
saving
administrative
expense
because
of
the
transitory
nature
of
so
many
of
these
not
related
household
and
thirdly
to
prevent
fraud
which
is
really
part
of
one
and
two,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
it,
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
proof
does
applicant
household
have
to
make
to
show
it's
eligibility
for
a
receipt
of
food
stamps,
just
a
verified
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
affidavits?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
that
verification
process?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
income
defined
do
you
know?
i
mean,
would
it
--
specifically
would
it
include
an
allowance
from
the
parents?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
is
not
income
under
the
federal
income
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
income
for
this
purpose
is
a
broad
area,
more
broadly
defined
than
income
as
defined
in
the
internal
revenue
code?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
a
–
you
have
to
swear
to
the,
in
making
the
application,
to
the
fact
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
brother
powell's
question
to
you
was
that
if
she
bought
separately,
even
though
she
is
now
living
with
the
other
woman,
under
the
knowles
decision
she
would
be
eligible
for
food
stamps.
so
she
be
no
worse
off
or
no
better
off
then
if
she
were
a
member
of
the
household
that
was
getting
food
stamps,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
grant
you
that
the
33
cents
a
day
is
a
poverty
level
or
below
it,
but
food
stamps
aren't
going
to
remedy
that.
the
question
is
whether
she
gets
or
doesn't
get
food
stamps
and
if
she
can
food
stamps
certainly
by
the
device
of
going
to
the
market
herself
then
she
can
get
them,
can't
she?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
she
could
still
have
a
single
kitchen
as
you
told
us?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
could
have
a
one
roof
over
their
heads,
be
in
one
dwelling
place
and
but
she
could
become
eligible
for
food
stamps
simply
by
doing
her
food
shopping
separately,
isn't
that
what
the
knowles
decision
says?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
back
enough
indicia
of
another
separate
economic
unit,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
alone
is
enough
is
it
not
under
the
knowles
case,
any
one
of
these
three
you
told
us?
justice
potter
stewart
so
did
she
could
do
that,
she
can
get
the
food
stamps,
can't
she?
i
am
just
--
that's
why
i
understood
mr.
powell
questioned
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
--
now
of
course
she
can't
do
very
much
with
33
cents
a
day,
pooling
or
not
pooling
but
if
–
why
is
she
worse
off
if
she
gets
food
stamps
by
doing
her
shopping
separately
and
the
other
member
of
the
household
do
her
shopping
separately
and
together
they
all
have
what
you
claim
they
should
have
as
a
household?
justice
potter
stewart
she
will
have
all
the
needs
with
or
without
food
stamps,
will
she
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
not
understand
why
if
she
is
eligible
for
food
stamps
by
the
simple
expedient
of
going
to
the
market
by
herself
and
her
fellow
member
of
the
household,
the
other
woman
can
also
go
to
the
market
by
herself
and
they
could
aggregate
those
two
food
stamps?
justice
potter
stewart
they
can
have
a
common
kitchen,
you
told
us
that?
