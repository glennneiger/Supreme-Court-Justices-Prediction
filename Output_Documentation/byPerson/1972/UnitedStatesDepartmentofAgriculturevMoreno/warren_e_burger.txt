e.

mr
pollack?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
in
dandridge
it's
argued
mr.
pollack
that,
i
think
it
was
dandridge
there
was
an
interference
with
very
important
right
of
privacy,
that
is
size
of
the
family
in
the
sense
that
the
regulation
discouraged
large
families
because
of
the
limitation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that,
unless
i
misunderstand
you
that
cuts
against
the
argument
you
have
been
making
for
about
the
last
three
minutes,
that
this
was
the
only
purpose
of
the
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
before
you
get
on
to
that,
let's
accept
your
composition
that
this
was
aimed
at
hippie
communes,
but
let's
assume
that
it
had
then
described
in
terms
that
unstable
establishments,
that
is
like
waldorf
historia
hotel
(ph)
in
the
sense
that
there
are
people
coming
and
going
everyday
are
extraordinarily
difficult
to
keep
track
of
and
would
lend
themselves
to
a
great
deal
of
false
registration
and
fraud,
would
you
then
be
making
the
same
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now
you
are
suggesting
on
active
congress
falls
because
all
of
the
evils
that
congress
wanted
to
guard
against
cannot
be
reached?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
make
it
a
fall?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
happens
at
criminal
code,
the
criminal
codes
don't
have
100%
or
anywhere
near
100%
effectiveness
if
we
can
believe
the
studies
and
do
you
mean
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
congress
to
enact
criminal
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
are
not
arguing
a
fourteenth
amendment
case,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
randolph
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you

is
submitted.
