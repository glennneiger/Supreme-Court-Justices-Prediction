justice
thurgood
marshall
would
they
be
eligible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what’s
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
it
was
the
difference
of
the
fact
that
they
are
--
they
didn’t
pool
their
resources,
and
if
they
had
pooled
then
they
would
still
be
ineligible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
would
be
eligible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right,
there
is
two
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
would
the
other
one
be
the
one
that
doesn't
have
the
children.
the
one
individual,
he
wouldn’t
be
eligible
because
he
is
not
a
group?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
individual
is
not
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
we're
talking
about
groups
in
this
case
aren’t
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
mrs.
keppler
be
qualified
as
an
individual?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
other
woman
eligible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
being
what,
dollars
and
cents
wise?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
again
how
is
that
a
hippie,
you
put
at
commune
can
meet
those
three
standard?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
my
question
is
can
they
meet
those
three
standards?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
what
is
wrong
with
them?
you
say
it
all
the
hippie
communes
that
you
are
after
and
now
you
say
the
hippie
communes
can
meet
the
standard?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
far
is
she
joined
together?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
am
with
my
brother
rehnquist,
now
you
are
going
one
step
further.
the
only
purpose
was
the
harm
to
hippie?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
didn't
harm
the
hippie,
where
does
that
leave
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
your
purpose
argument,
if
there
is
an
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
agree
that
they
did
not
accomplish
their
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
now
why
do
you
keep
the
arguing
the
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
hypothesize
without
to
hippies?
wouldn't
you
be
making
more
progress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
we
have
to
have
20
kitchens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
regulations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
--
i
thought

want
to
be
considered
as
20
separate
groups?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
order
to
do
that
meet

20
separate
kitchens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
they
have
one
kitchen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and

thurgood
marshall

justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
see
why
the
poor
people
can't
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
seem
to
me
for
local
relief
to
local
home
relief
is
not
good
enough.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
enough
about
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
stamp
program
wasn't
take
up
the
lack
of
some
stupid
senator
that
hasn't
got
sense
enough
to
give
enough
home
relief,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
supplementary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
won't
make
them
pay
71
bucks
if
they
were
to
give
them
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
they
get,
if
on
the
oasis
and
they
could
pool
it
all
together
and
get
the
food
stamps
how
much
will
she
get
in
food
stamp?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
live
