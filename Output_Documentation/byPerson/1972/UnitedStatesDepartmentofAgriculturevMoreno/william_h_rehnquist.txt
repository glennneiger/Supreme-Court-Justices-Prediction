justice
william

rehnquist
well
to
say
something
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
versus
unconstitutional
on
its
face
suggests
some
notion
of
over
breadth
i
take
it
and
i
would
think
that
would
have
no
application
unless
you
get
into
the
compelling
state
interest
or
base
it
on
some
sort
of
the
first
amendment
principle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
one

your
arguments
that
the
legislative
motive
here
invalidates
the
thing
because
they
were
out
to
get
the
hippies
communes?
justice
william

failed?

enacted
the
kind
of
the
statute
that
congress
did,
not
whether
a
congress'
purposes
is
actually
carried
by
the
