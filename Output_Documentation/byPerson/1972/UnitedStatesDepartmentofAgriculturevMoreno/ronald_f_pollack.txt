mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
determining
whether
the
unrelated
household
provision,
here
at
issue
violates
equal
protection.
i
think
there
are
two
useful
tools
for
analysis.
the
first
tool
is
the
traditional
tool,
the
traditional
standard,
is
the
provision
rationally
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
food
stamp
program.
is
it
reasonably
related
to
some
legitimate
governmental
purpose?
the
second
tool
that
i
think
is
applicable
in
this
case
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
has
because
of
provision
here
at
issue
impinges
directly
upon
appellee's
associational
and
privacy
interest.
i
would
like
to
concentrate
on
the
first
test,
however,
the
traditional
standard.
for
it's
my
opinion
that
under
either
standard,
this
provision
does
not
meet
the
standards
of
equal
protection.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
at
the
very
most
your
honor
i
think
in
that
case
it
only
had
incidental
effect
with
relation
to
that.
here
there’s
a
very
direct
relationship
with
the
associational
and
the
privacy
right.
here
only
if
you
associate
in
the
confines
of
your
home
are
you
denied
food
stamps,
only
for
that
reason
and
it's
a
very
direct
intention.
there
at
most
it
was
indirect.
i
think
though
under
any
standard
whether
we
use
a
compelling
governmental
interest
standard
or
whether
we
use
a
traditional
standard,
you
cannot
find
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
that
is
reasonably
related
to
by
this
provision.
now
what
is
the
real
purpose
between
--
for
the
unrelated
household
provision
was
very
clear,
is
to
eliminate
hippies,
to
eliminate
hippie
communes
from
the
food
stamp
program.
how
do
we
glean
this
purpose?
well
we
glean
this
purpose
from
the
congressional
history,
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
and
although
that
legislative
history
is
very
sparse
because
it
was
not
the
debated
it
was
formulated
for
the
first
time
by
conference
community
and
it
was
hurriedly
passed
by
the
house
and
the
senate
thereafter.
there
are
three
different
places
in
the
legislative
history
that
refer
to
this
provision
and
in
each
of
those
places
you
find
reference
to
the
anti
hippie
commune
purpose
of
the
provision.
secondly
in
post
legislative
history,
you
will
note
that
six
republican
senators
from
the
senate
nutrition
committee
indicated
that
this
provision
purely
had
an
anti
hippie
purpose
to
it
and
in
fact
they
decried
the
fact
that
this
provision
was
not
going
to
harm
the
hippies,
but
in
fact
it
was
going
to
harm
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
in
the
district
court,
the
appellant
said
that
the
only
intention
that
we
see
regard
to
what
was
the
congressional
intention
in
this
provision
is
to
harm
hippie
communes.
the
appellants
in
fact
admitted
to
this
court
in
their
reply
brief
and
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
deny
food
stamps
to
hippie
communes.
administrators
of
the
program
as
reflected
by
the
california
welfare
director,
they
all
call
it
the
anti-hippie
commune
provision.
well
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
reason
under
the
traditional
equal
protection
test
that
this
provision
is
--
then
violates
equal
protection.
the
first
is
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
itself
is
impermissible,
but
even
more
important
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
doubt
it
very
much
your
honor
because
it
did
not
seem
to
be
a
very
pressing
concern
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
that
this
was
not
a
very
substantial
concern.
this
was
not
even
passed
by
the
house
or
the
senate
for
the
first
time
it
was
introduced
in
conference
committee.
so
this
wasn't
really
a
pressing
concern
in
congress.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
correct
that
is
the
only
purpose
that
we
can
glean
from
the
sparse
legislative
history.
now
it
seems
to
me
when
one
looks
at
purpose
and
you
try
to
find
how
is
this
provision
rationally
relates
to
that
purpose,
you
will
find
that
there
is
no
rational
relationship
to
that
purpose
and
in
order
to
find
that
i
think
it
is
important
to
examine
knowles
v.
butz,
the
case
that
was
cited
to
by
the
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
this
provision
is
substantially
different
and
let
me
explain
why
and
i
think
in
order
to
understand
why
it's
important
to
examine
the
decision
knowles
v.
butz.
the
reason
is
if
you
look
at
decision
in
knowles
v.
butz,
for
determining
what
is
going
to
be
the
group
of
people,
to
find
out
whether
they
are
household
three
factors
must
be
present.
first
factor
is
that
they
must
live
as
one
economic
unit.
secondly
they
must
purchase
food
in
common
and
third
they
must
share
common
cooking
facilities.
the
appellants
argue
in
essence
in
this
case
that
this
provision
does
not
have
harsh
effect
because
all
people
have
to
do
in
order
to
eliminate
themselves
from
the
harshness
of
this
provision
is
to
separate
themselves
and
live
as
separate
economic
units.
as
an
example,
if
a
household
was
denied
at
food
stamps
because
there
unrelated
people
in
there.
all
they
have
to
do
is
divide
themselves
or
fractionate
themselves
and
therefore
they
can
then
be
eligible
as
separate
households.
what
i
would
suggest
your
honor
is
that
this
provision
does
more
to
make
it
difficult
to
administrator
the
program
because
what
it
encourages
is,
is
it
encourages
the
voluntary
poor
people
to
fractionate
their
households,
,making
it
much
more
difficult
to
keep
track
of
the
money,
making
it
much
more
difficult
to
administrator
the
program.
the
people
who
cannot
fractionate
their
households
are
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
as
a
california
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
your
honor
a
hippie
commune
if
it
wants
to
--
assume
you
have
a
commune
of
20
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
they
can.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
even
though
the
provision
was
directed
at
hippie
communes,
the
provision
in
fact
does
not
harm
them.
what
the
provision
actually
does
harm
are
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
those
people
who
cannot
fractionate
their
households,
those
people
who
cannot
separate
themselves
as
independent
economic
units.
take
as
an
example
mrs.
moreno.
mrs.
moreno
is
a
living
in
a
household
with
mrs.
sanchez.
she
is
living
there
because
she
is
extremely
poor.
she
has
merely
$75
of
income
and
she
is
diabetic
and
she
needs
healthcare.
the
reason
that
she
has
joined
together
is
out
of
brutal
necessity.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
she
has
joined
together
for
all
purposes,
for
economic
purposes,
for
living
arrangements.
in
other
words
they
treat
themselves
together
as
one
economic
unit.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
your
honor
the
provision,
the
provision
in
it's
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
they
can
fractionate
their
households
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
on
its
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
that
is
correct.
the
provision
only
harms
in
fact
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
am
not
sure
i
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
what
i
am
saying
is
the
provision
can
only
really
operate
against
poorest
of
the
poor.
the
reason
it
can
only
operate
against
the
poorest
of
the
poor
is
that
they
are
the
only
ones
who
cannot
fractionate
their
households
if
you
fractionate
your
household
then
you
will
be
eligible
for
food
stamp
assistance,
in
other
words
if
you
live
as
a
separate
economic
unit.
however,
if
you
cannot
do
that
and
almost
by
definitions
of
poorest
of
the
poor
cannot
do
it,
they
need
to
share
living
arrangements.
they
are
the
ones
who
are
going
to
be
harmed
by
this
provision.
by
it's
very
nature
this
provision
harms
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
it
does
not
harm
the
voluntary
poor
because
the
voluntary
poor,
voluntarily
can
separate
themselves
from
those
people
who
live
under
the
roof
with
them
and
therefore
all
of
them
can
become
individual
separate
units.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
have
two
arguments
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
first
argument
is
at
the
purpose
itself
was
impermissible,
but
even
more
--
excuse
me.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
correct
the
purpose
nonetheless
is
impermissible,
but
even
if
you
said
the
purposes
was
permissible,
the
purposes
is
not
reasonably
related
to
by
this
provision
because
what
occurs
in
this
situation
as
the
california
welfare
director
said
and
if
i
might,
i
would
you
refer
you
to
page
43
of
the
appendix.
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
two
paragraphs,
it
says
as
follows.
“the
related
household
limitations
will
eliminate
many
households
from
eligibility
in
the
food
stamp
program.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
congressional
intent
of
the
new
regulations
are
specifically
aimed
at
the
hippies
and
the
hippie
communes.
most
people
in
this
category
can
and
will
all
through
their
living
arrangements
in
order
to
remain
eligible
for
food
stamps.
however
the
afdc
mothers
who
tried
to
raise
their
standard
of
living
by
sharing
housing
will
be
affected.
they
will
not
be
able
to
utilize
the
altered
living
patterns
in
order
to
continue
to
be
eligible
without
giving
out
their
advantage
of
shared
housing
costs.
in
california
it
is
common
practice
for
the
very
poor
to
move
in
with
friends
during
unemployment
or
any
type
of
crisis.
many
of
the
migrant
labor
camps
cannot
be
eligible
on
the
basis
of
related
household.
this
section
will
eliminate
a
segment
of
migrant
workers
who
by
definition
are
to
be
eligible
for
food
stamps.
we
have
found
no
way
to
interpret,
so
these
migrants
and
this
type
of
camp
can
be
eligible.
what
i
am
saying
i
think
is
clear
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
number
one,
the
purpose
that
congress
intended
with
this
provision
was
to
harm
hippies.
i
say
that
that
impermissible.
but
even
if
you
did
not
agree
with
me,
i
say
that
that
purposes
is
not
reasonably
related
to
by
this
provision.
this
provision
in
actual
affect
obviously
must
harm
the
poorest
to
the
poor.
they
have
no
option
whatsoever.
they
must
join
with
other
people
when
they
are
unemployed
when
they
are
evicted
from
their
household,
whey
they
are
afdc
recipients
or
particularly
if
they
are
migrants.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
your
honor
i
cannot
find
a
permissible
purpose
that
is
rationally
related
to
by
this
provision.
there
is
just
no
such
purpose.
in
fact
in
the
district
court
the
appellants
were
asked
several
times,
what
did
they
consider
was
rationally
related
purpose
in
this
provision
and
they
never
produced
a
thing,
they
never
produced
a
purposes
whatsoever.
the
best
they
could
offering
the
district
court
and
you
find
this
on
pages
4a
to
5a
of
appendix
to
our
brief,
they
said
it
as
a
rational
to
the
extent
that
the
act
so
far
and
no
farther.
they
said
that
congress
can
get
food
stamps
to
whom
they
want.
well,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
rational
purpose.
now
if
we
want
fictionalize
and
try
to
figure
out
some
other
purpose
that
congress
really
intended
even
though
we
know
in
fact,
congress
only
intended
to
harm
the
hippies,
that
was
their
only
purpose
with
this
provision,
let's
try
to
fictionalize
such
of
the
purpose.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
it
leaves
you
only
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
your
honor
what
i
am
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
your
honor
i
am
trying
to
find
some
purpose
to
which
provision
is
rationally
related
to
and
quite
frankly
i
cannot
find
one.
i
can
hypothesize
some.
let
us
take
a
look
at
what
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
it
is
very
clear
that
is
persons
who
are
not
voluntary
poor,
it
is
the
persons
who
are
not
hippies,
they
are
the
ones
who
are
harmed
by
this
provision
and
they
are
harmed
irrationally,
merely
because
they
live
with
someone
else
to
whom
they
are
unrelated.
now
your
honor
we
have
been
told
that
there
maybe
some
other
purposes
involved
which
can
be
hypothesized
as
to
why
this
provision
is
rational.
is
it
the
prevention
or
the
detection
of
fraud,
but
it
seems
clear
that
the
denial
of
assistance
solely
as
a
result
that
people
are
unrelated
to
one
another
is
not
related
at
all
to
the
question
of
preventing
fraud.
people
who
are
intent
on
fraud
are
likely
to
alter
their
living
arrangements.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
someone
like
the
voluntary
poor,
if
their
intent
is
to
defraud
people
in
the
food
stamp
program,
they
will
alter
their
living
arrangement.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
they
are
not
reached
by
this
provision
in
any
rational
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
your
honor
because
it
is
not
rationally
related
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no
i
am
not
saying
that
it
all,
your
honor.
i
see
no
correlation
at
all
with
any
other
purposes
that
were
hypothesized
by
the
government
in
this
case
with
this
provision.
there
is
just
no
correlation
at
all.
there
is
no
reasonable,
no
rational
relationship,
between
this
provision
and
any
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
if
we
could
figure
out
any
legitimate
governmental
purpose
to
which
this
is
reasonably
related
to
under
the
traditional
equal
protection
test
then
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
unfortunately
your
honor
there
is
no
such
legitimate
governmental
purpose
to
which
this
is
rationally
related
to.
the
prevention
of
fraud
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no
i
am
not.
we
are
arguing
a
fifth
amendment
case.
your
honor
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
as
you
held
in
dunn
v.
blumstein
where
you
said
false
swearing
with
regard
to
the
residence
requirement
is
not
at
a
deterrent
to
someone
who
is
intending
fraud.
here
someone
who
is
intent
on
defrauding
people
in
the
food
stamp
program
will
clearly
alter
their
living
arrangements.
it's
very
simple
for
them
to
alter
their
living
arrangements.
all
they
have
to
do
is
live
as
different
economic
units.
take
as
an
example,
take
as
an
example
of
group
of
20
people
living
in
a
commune.
if
those
people
are
intent
on
defrauding
in
the
food
stamp
program,
all
they
need
to
do
is
fractionate
their
households,
live
as
20
separate
economic
units
and
they
can
get
food
stamps.
the
poorest
of
the
poor
they
cannot
do
this
because
out
of
brutal
necessity,
they
must
live
together.
mrs.
moreno
as
an
example
because
merely
$75
of
income
of
which
after
she
pays
for
her
rent,
after
she
pays
for
all
other
housing
cost,
she
has
merely
$10
left.
if
she
spent
all
of
that
money
on
food,
she
would
merely
have
$0.33
a
day
in
order
to
live.
she
must
live
with
the
sanchez
family
because
that
is
the
only
way
she
is
going
to
survive.
there
is
no
way
that
she
can
fractionate
her
household.
as
a
result
since
she
is
unrelated
to
the
sanchez
family
everyone
in
that
household
is
denied
food
stamps
under
this
provision.
this
same
is
true
with
the
hejnys.
the
hejnys
have
taken
in
a
young
girl
sharon
sharpe
(ph)
who
had
been
unwanted
by
her
parents.
she
lived
in
a
children's
home
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
the
sharpes
are
very
poor.
the
sharpes
only
have
income
when
mr.
sharpe
who
only
has
occasional
employment,
when
he
has
an
employment
which
is
purely
seasonal.
the
sharpe
family
cannot
kick
sharon
out
of
the
household
with
any
due
conscious
and
as
a
result
since
sharon
sharpe
is
unrelated
to
the
hejnys
family
no
one
in
that
household
is
going
to
receive
food
stamps.
they
cannot
fractionate
their
household.
it's
them
who
are
going
to
be
denied
food
stamps,
not
the
hippie
communes,
not
the
voluntary
poor.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
there
is
an
application.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
there
is
an
application.
there
is
affidavits
and
there
is
a
rigorous
verification
process.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
in
essence
if
someone
says
i
have
got
x
income,
one
has
to
prove
that
income.
one
has
to
either
bring
in
income
slip
or
one
has
to
--
in
some
way
one
has
to
prove
it.
it
is
not,
it
is
not
the
word
of
recipient
that
is
taken.
the
recipient
has
to
show
documentation.
if
he
fulfills
that
documentation
then
he
is
eligible
for
food
stamps.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
it
does.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes,
that
is
included
as
income
or
welfare
is
included
as
income,
social
security
benefits
are
income.
for
person
who
has
a
job,
any
earnings
from
that
is
included
as
income.
all
of
that
is
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that's
correct
and
if
you
swore
falsely
then
you
are
certainly
can
be
penal
–
yes.
your
honor,
i'd
suggest
you
that
this
program
is
not
going
to
be
easier
to
administer.
this
program
is
not
easier.
it
would
be
easier
to
detect
fraud
through
this
provision.
quite
the
contrary,
what
is
going
to
happen
is
the
voluntary
poor
who
are
going
to
fractionate
their
households
are
going
to
multiply
the
applications
that
are
necessary
to
get
them
into
the
program.
in
other
words,
take
the
hypothetical
i
gave
before.
if
there
is
a
group
of
voluntary
poor
people,
20
people
and
if
they
want
to
stay
in
the
food
stamp
program
all
they
have
to
do
is
separate
their
households
into
20
different
groups.
instead
of
making
a
program
easier
to
administer,
quite
the
contrary,
it
will
make
it
harder
to
administer.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
your
honor.
in
order
to,
in
order
to
include
yourself
as
a
--
as
a
--
in
order
to
get
yourself
excluded
from
the
group
that's
considered
for
a
household
purposes,
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
one
of
three
elements
are
missing.
element
one
is
that
you
don't
live
as
an
economic
unit
or
you
can
show
that
you
purchase
food
separately
or
you
can
show
that
you
have
separate
cooking
facilities.
so
if
anyone
of
those
different
--
if
anyone
of
those
different
factors
are
not
present
then
you
are
not
considered
a
grouping
for
household
purposes.
so
in
other
words
if
you
do
not
live
as
an
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
they
could
have
one
kitchen.
if
they
all
live
as
a
separate
economic
units
then
they
will
be
treated
as
20
different
households.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
they
had
even
one
kitchen,
as
long
as
they
live
as
20
separate
economic
units.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
in
other
words
in
other
words
they
don't
purchase
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
they
don't
purchase
food
in
common.
they
don't
purchase
their
--
they
don't
paid
any
utilities
in
common.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
if
someone
has
no
income
whatsoever,
but
one
has
a
meager
income
that
someone
like,
like
mrs.
moreno
has,
she
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
live
on
her
separate
income.
her
income
alone
is
33
cents
a
day
for
food,
that
is
if
she
purchases
no
clothing,
that
if
she
purchases
no
household
supplies,
that
if
she
purchases
no
hygienic
items.
she
must
combine
with
another
household
in
order
to
live.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
the
problem
is
that
in
many
states
you
cannot
get
relief.
in
order
to
get
relief
you
must
show
of
four
factors.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
the
food
stamp
program
was
intended
to
provide
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no
it
was
intended
to
provide
people
with
all
the
their
very
nutritional
needs.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that's
correct.
if
you
look
at
sections
201
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
because
what
you
are
actually
paying,
you
are
paying
your
normal
expenditures
for
food
under
the
program
and
your
coupon
allotment
that
you
receive
is
supposed
to
provide
you
with
nutritional
adequacy.
you
will
find
that
in
the
declaration
of
policy,
you
will
find
that
in
section
203,
2013(a),
2016(a).
all
of
those
provisions
say
that
the
coupon
allotment
in
the
food
stamp
program
is
supposed
to
provide
you
with
nutritional
adequacy.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no
your
honor,
it
stems
first
from
the
statute
to
itself
2012(e)
and
knowles
actually
interprets
that
statute.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
can
anyone
do
that?
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
your
honor
--
because
if
you
take
a
look
as
an
example
at
mrs.
moreno,
she
just
cannot
get
nutritional
adequacy
if
she
used
just
her
money.
she
only
has,
even
if
she
doesn't
spend
a
single
penny
on
clothing,
not
a
single
penny
on
household
supplies,
not
a
single
penny
on
so
many
different
necessaries,
even
if
she
doesn't
make
expenditures
for
those
purposes
she
only
has
33
cents
per
day
for
food.
now
it
defies
my
imagination
your
honor
as
that
how
one
can
get
the
nutritionally
adequate
diet
with
only
33
cents
a
day.
so
what
she
does
is
she
combines
with
another
household
and
that
household
when
they
combine,
it
gives
them
a
greater
opportunity
to
obtain
an
adequate
nutritional
diet
and
it's
only
through
that
means
will
they
be
able
to
get
some
thing
like
better
nutrition.
if
she
does
it
alone
she
is
just
not
going
to
survive.
as
a
result
out
of
that
necessity,
since
she
did
combine,
she
has
denied
food
stamps.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
she
purchased
her
food,
if
she
had
--
if
she
didn't
pool
her
resources
with
the
sanchez
family
that's
correct,
then
she
could
get
food
stamps.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
however,
in
order
to
survive
she
has
pooled
her
resources.
she
has
lived
as
one
economic
unit.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
the
knowles
decision
says
it
is
correct.
if
you
live
as
separate
economic
units
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
one
of
the
indicia,
yes.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
if
she
could
do
it.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
your
honor,
there
are
other
needs
that
people
have
other
than
food
as
well
and
as
a
result
she
has
got
health
needs,
she
has
got
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
she
has.
she
certainly
does
have
those
needs.
however
in
order
to
satisfy
those
other
needs
it's
important
for
her
to
combine
her
resources
with
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
they
can't
aggregate
those
food
stamps
because
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
they
can
have
a
common
kitchen,
but
they
can't
purchase
food
in
common.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
she
would
get
$36
in
food
stamps
per
month.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
you
do
your
honor,
clearly
you
do.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
my
time
is
up.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
determining
whether
the
unrelated
household
provision,
here
at
issue
violates
equal
protection.
i
think
there
are
two
useful
tools
for
analysis.
the
first
tool
is
the
traditional
tool,
the
traditional
standard,
is
the
provision
rationally
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
food
stamp
program.
is
it
reasonably
related
to
some
legitimate
governmental
purpose?
the
second
tool
that
i
think
is
applicable
in
this
case
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
has
because
of
provision
here
at
issue
impinges
directly
upon
appellee's
associational
and
privacy
interest.
i
would
like
to
concentrate
on
the
first
test,
however,
the
traditional
standard.
for
it's
my
opinion
that
under
either
standard,
this
provision
does
not
meet
the
standards
of
equal
protection.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
at
the
very
most
your
honor
i
think
in
that
case
it
only
had
incidental
effect
with
relation
to
that.
here
there’s
a
very
direct
relationship
with
the
associational
and
the
privacy
right.
here
only
if
you
associate
in
the
confines
of
your
home
are
you
denied
food
stamps,
only
for
that
reason
and
it's
a
very
direct
intention.
there
at
most
it
was
indirect.
i
think
though
under
any
standard
whether
we
use
a
compelling
governmental
interest
standard
or
whether
we
use
a
traditional
standard,
you
cannot
find
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
that
is
reasonably
related
to
by
this
provision.
now
what
is
the
real
purpose
between
--
for
the
unrelated
household
provision
was
very
clear,
is
to
eliminate
hippies,
to
eliminate
hippie
communes
from
the
food
stamp
program.
how
do
we
glean
this
purpose?
well
we
glean
this
purpose
from
the
congressional
history,
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
and
although
that
legislative
history
is
very
sparse
because
it
was
not
the
debated
it
was
formulated
for
the
first
time
by
conference
community
and
it
was
hurriedly
passed
by
the
house
and
the
senate
thereafter.
there
are
three
different
places
in
the
legislative
history
that
refer
to
this
provision
and
in
each
of
those
places
you
find
reference
to
the
anti
hippie
commune
purpose
of
the
provision.
secondly
in
post
legislative
history,
you
will
note
that
six
republican
senators
from
the
senate
nutrition
committee
indicated
that
this
provision
purely
had
an
anti
hippie
purpose
to
it
and
in
fact
they
decried
the
fact
that
this
provision
was
not
going
to
harm
the
hippies,
but
in
fact
it
was
going
to
harm
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
in
the
district
court,
the
appellant
said
that
the
only
intention
that
we
see
regard
to
what
was
the
congressional
intention
in
this
provision
is
to
harm
hippie
communes.
the
appellants
in
fact
admitted
to
this
court
in
their
reply
brief
and
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
deny
food
stamps
to
hippie
communes.
administrators
of
the
program
as
reflected
by
the
california
welfare
director,
they
all
call
it
the
anti-hippie
commune
provision.
well
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
reason
under
the
traditional
equal
protection
test
that
this
provision
is
--
then
violates
equal
protection.
the
first
is
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
itself
is
impermissible,
but
even
more
important
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
doubt
it
very
much
your
honor
because
it
did
not
seem
to
be
a
very
pressing
concern
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
that
this
was
not
a
very
substantial
concern.
this
was
not
even
passed
by
the
house
or
the
senate
for
the
first
time
it
was
introduced
in
conference
committee.
so
this
wasn't
really
a
pressing
concern
in
congress.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
correct
that
is
the
only
purpose
that
we
can
glean
from
the
sparse
legislative
history.
now
it
seems
to
me
when
one
looks
at
purpose
and
you
try
to
find
how
is
this
provision
rationally
relates
to
that
purpose,
you
will
find
that
there
is
no
rational
relationship
to
that
purpose
and
in
order
to
find
that
i
think
it
is
important
to
examine
knowles
v.
butz,
the
case
that
was
cited
to
by
the
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
this
provision
is
substantially
different
and
let
me
explain
why
and
i
think
in
order
to
understand
why
it's
important
to
examine
the
decision
knowles
v.
butz.
the
reason
is
if
you
look
at
decision
in
knowles
v.
butz,
for
determining
what
is
going
to
be
the
group
of
people,
to
find
out
whether
they
are
household
three
factors
must
be
present.
first
factor
is
that
they
must
live
as
one
economic
unit.
secondly
they
must
purchase
food
in
common
and
third
they
must
share
common
cooking
facilities.
the
appellants
argue
in
essence
in
this
case
that
this
provision
does
not
have
harsh
effect
because
all
people
have
to
do
in
order
to
eliminate
themselves
from
the
harshness
of
this
provision
is
to
separate
themselves
and
live
as
separate
economic
units.
as
an
example,
if
a
household
was
denied
at
food
stamps
because
there
unrelated
people
in
there.
all
they
have
to
do
is
divide
themselves
or
fractionate
themselves
and
therefore
they
can
then
be
eligible
as
separate
households.
what
i
would
suggest
your
honor
is
that
this
provision
does
more
to
make
it
difficult
to
administrator
the
program
because
what
it
encourages
is,
is
it
encourages
the
voluntary
poor
people
to
fractionate
their
households,
,making
it
much
more
difficult
to
keep
track
of
the
money,
making
it
much
more
difficult
to
administrator
the
program.
the
people
who
cannot
fractionate
their
households
are
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
as
a
california
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
your
honor
a
hippie
commune
if
it
wants
to
--
assume
you
have
a
commune
of
20
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
they
can.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
even
though
the
provision
was
directed
at
hippie
communes,
the
provision
in
fact
does
not
harm
them.
what
the
provision
actually
does
harm
are
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
those
people
who
cannot
fractionate
their
households,
those
people
who
cannot
separate
themselves
as
independent
economic
units.
take
as
an
example
mrs.
moreno.
mrs.
moreno
is
a
living
in
a
household
with
mrs.
sanchez.
she
is
living
there
because
she
is
extremely
poor.
she
has
merely
$75
of
income
and
she
is
diabetic
and
she
needs
healthcare.
the
reason
that
she
has
joined
together
is
out
of
brutal
necessity.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
she
has
joined
together
for
all
purposes,
for
economic
purposes,
for
living
arrangements.
in
other
words
they
treat
themselves
together
as
one
economic
unit.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
your
honor
the
provision,
the
provision
in
it's
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
they
can
fractionate
their
households
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
on
its
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
that
is
correct.
the
provision
only
harms
in
fact
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
am
not
sure
i
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
what
i
am
saying
is
the
provision
can
only
really
operate
against
poorest
of
the
poor.
the
reason
it
can
only
operate
against
the
poorest
of
the
poor
is
that
they
are
the
only
ones
who
cannot
fractionate
their
households
if
you
fractionate
your
household
then
you
will
be
eligible
for
food
stamp
assistance,
in
other
words
if
you
live
as
a
separate
economic
unit.
however,
if
you
cannot
do
that
and
almost
by
definitions
of
poorest
of
the
poor
cannot
do
it,
they
need
to
share
living
arrangements.
they
are
the
ones
who
are
going
to
be
harmed
by
this
provision.
by
it's
very
nature
this
provision
harms
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
it
does
not
harm
the
voluntary
poor
because
the
voluntary
poor,
voluntarily
can
separate
themselves
from
those
people
who
live
under
the
roof
with
them
and
therefore
all
of
them
can
become
individual
separate
units.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
i
have
two
arguments
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
first
argument
is
at
the
purpose
itself
was
impermissible,
but
even
more
--
excuse
me.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
correct
the
purpose
nonetheless
is
impermissible,
but
even
if
you
said
the
purposes
was
permissible,
the
purposes
is
not
reasonably
related
to
by
this
provision
because
what
occurs
in
this
situation
as
the
california
welfare
director
said
and
if
i
might,
i
would
you
refer
you
to
page
43
of
the
appendix.
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
two
paragraphs,
it
says
as
follows.
“the
related
household
limitations
will
eliminate
many
households
from
eligibility
in
the
food
stamp
program.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
congressional
intent
of
the
new
regulations
are
specifically
aimed
at
the
hippies
and
the
hippie
communes.
most
people
in
this
category
can
and
will
all
through
their
living
arrangements
in
order
to
remain
eligible
for
food
stamps.
however
the
afdc
mothers
who
tried
to
raise
their
standard
of
living
by
sharing
housing
will
be
affected.
they
will
not
be
able
to
utilize
the
altered
living
patterns
in
order
to
continue
to
be
eligible
without
giving
out
their
advantage
of
shared
housing
costs.
in
california
it
is
common
practice
for
the
very
poor
to
move
in
with
friends
during
unemployment
or
any
type
of
crisis.
many
of
the
migrant
labor
camps
cannot
be
eligible
on
the
basis
of
related
household.
this
section
will
eliminate
a
segment
of
migrant
workers
who
by
definition
are
to
be
eligible
for
food
stamps.
we
have
found
no
way
to
interpret,
so
these
migrants
and
this
type
of
camp
can
be
eligible.
what
i
am
saying
i
think
is
clear
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
number
one,
the
purpose
that
congress
intended
with
this
provision
was
to
harm
hippies.
i
say
that
that
impermissible.
but
even
if
you
did
not
agree
with
me,
i
say
that
that
purposes
is
not
reasonably
related
to
by
this
provision.
this
provision
in
actual
affect
obviously
must
harm
the
poorest
to
the
poor.
they
have
no
option
whatsoever.
they
must
join
with
other
people
when
they
are
unemployed
when
they
are
evicted
from
their
household,
whey
they
are
afdc
recipients
or
particularly
if
they
are
migrants.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
your
honor
i
cannot
find
a
permissible
purpose
that
is
rationally
related
to
by
this
provision.
there
is
just
no
such
purpose.
in
fact
in
the
district
court
the
appellants
were
asked
several
times,
what
did
they
consider
was
rationally
related
purpose
in
this
provision
and
they
never
produced
a
thing,
they
never
produced
a
purposes
whatsoever.
the
best
they
could
offering
the
district
court
and
you
find
this
on
pages
4a
to
5a
of
appendix
to
our
brief,
they
said
it
as
a
rational
to
the
extent
that
the
act
so
far
and
no
farther.
they
said
that
congress
can
get
food
stamps
to
whom
they
want.
well,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
rational
purpose.
now
if
we
want
fictionalize
and
try
to
figure
out
some
other
purpose
that
congress
really
intended
even
though
we
know
in
fact,
congress
only
intended
to
harm
the
hippies,
that
was
their
only
purpose
with
this
provision,
let's
try
to
fictionalize
such
of
the
purpose.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
it
leaves
you
only
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
your
honor
what
i
am
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
your
honor
i
am
trying
to
find
some
purpose
to
which
provision
is
rationally
related
to
and
quite
frankly
i
cannot
find
one.
i
can
hypothesize
some.
let
us
take
a
look
at
what
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
it
is
very
clear
that
is
persons
who
are
not
voluntary
poor,
it
is
the
persons
who
are
not
hippies,
they
are
the
ones
who
are
harmed
by
this
provision
and
they
are
harmed
irrationally,
merely
because
they
live
with
someone
else
to
whom
they
are
unrelated.
now
your
honor
we
have
been
told
that
there
maybe
some
other
purposes
involved
which
can
be
hypothesized
as
to
why
this
provision
is
rational.
is
it
the
prevention
or
the
detection
of
fraud,
but
it
seems
clear
that
the
denial
of
assistance
solely
as
a
result
that
people
are
unrelated
to
one
another
is
not
related
at
all
to
the
question
of
preventing
fraud.
people
who
are
intent
on
fraud
are
likely
to
alter
their
living
arrangements.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
someone
like
the
voluntary
poor,
if
their
intent
is
to
defraud
people
in
the
food
stamp
program,
they
will
alter
their
living
arrangement.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
they
are
not
reached
by
this
provision
in
any
rational
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
your
honor
because
it
is
not
rationally
related
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no
i
am
not
saying
that
it
all,
your
honor.
i
see
no
correlation
at
all
with
any
other
purposes
that
were
hypothesized
by
the
government
in
this
case
with
this
provision.
there
is
just
no
correlation
at
all.
there
is
no
reasonable,
no
rational
relationship,
between
this
provision
and
any
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
if
we
could
figure
out
any
legitimate
governmental
purpose
to
which
this
is
reasonably
related
to
under
the
traditional
equal
protection
test
then
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
unfortunately
your
honor
there
is
no
such
legitimate
governmental
purpose
to
which
this
is
rationally
related
to.
the
prevention
of
fraud
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no
i
am
not.
we
are
arguing
a
fifth
amendment
case.
your
honor
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
as
you
held
in
dunn
v.
blumstein
where
you
said
false
swearing
with
regard
to
the
residence
requirement
is
not
at
a
deterrent
to
someone
who
is
intending
fraud.
here
someone
who
is
intent
on
defrauding
people
in
the
food
stamp
program
will
clearly
alter
their
living
arrangements.
it's
very
simple
for
them
to
alter
their
living
arrangements.
all
they
have
to
do
is
live
as
different
economic
units.
take
as
an
example,
take
as
an
example
of
group
of
20
people
living
in
a
commune.
if
those
people
are
intent
on
defrauding
in
the
food
stamp
program,
all
they
need
to
do
is
fractionate
their
households,
live
as
20
separate
economic
units
and
they
can
get
food
stamps.
the
poorest
of
the
poor
they
cannot
do
this
because
out
of
brutal
necessity,
they
must
live
together.
mrs.
moreno
as
an
example
because
merely
$75
of
income
of
which
after
she
pays
for
her
rent,
after
she
pays
for
all
other
housing
cost,
she
has
merely
$10
left.
if
she
spent
all
of
that
money
on
food,
she
would
merely
have
$0.33
a
day
in
order
to
live.
she
must
live
with
the
sanchez
family
because
that
is
the
only
way
she
is
going
to
survive.
there
is
no
way
that
she
can
fractionate
her
household.
as
a
result
since
she
is
unrelated
to
the
sanchez
family
everyone
in
that
household
is
denied
food
stamps
under
this
provision.
this
same
is
true
with
the
hejnys.
the
hejnys
have
taken
in
a
young
girl
sharon
sharpe
(ph)
who
had
been
unwanted
by
her
parents.
she
lived
in
a
children's
home
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
the
sharpes
are
very
poor.
the
sharpes
only
have
income
when
mr.
sharpe
who
only
has
occasional
employment,
when
he
has
an
employment
which
is
purely
seasonal.
the
sharpe
family
cannot
kick
sharon
out
of
the
household
with
any
due
conscious
and
as
a
result
since
sharon
sharpe
is
unrelated
to
the
hejnys
family
no
one
in
that
household
is
going
to
receive
food
stamps.
they
cannot
fractionate
their
household.
it's
them
who
are
going
to
be
denied
food
stamps,
not
the
hippie
communes,
not
the
voluntary
poor.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
there
is
an
application.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
there
is
an
application.
there
is
affidavits
and
there
is
a
rigorous
verification
process.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
in
essence
if
someone
says
i
have
got
x
income,
one
has
to
prove
that
income.
one
has
to
either
bring
in
income
slip
or
one
has
to
--
in
some
way
one
has
to
prove
it.
it
is
not,
it
is
not
the
word
of
recipient
that
is
taken.
the
recipient
has
to
show
documentation.
if
he
fulfills
that
documentation
then
he
is
eligible
for
food
stamps.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
it
does.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes,
that
is
included
as
income
or
welfare
is
included
as
income,
social
security
benefits
are
income.
for
person
who
has
a
job,
any
earnings
from
that
is
included
as
income.
all
of
that
is
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that's
correct
and
if
you
swore
falsely
then
you
are
certainly
can
be
penal
–
yes.
your
honor,
i'd
suggest
you
that
this
program
is
not
going
to
be
easier
to
administer.
this
program
is
not
easier.
it
would
be
easier
to
detect
fraud
through
this
provision.
quite
the
contrary,
what
is
going
to
happen
is
the
voluntary
poor
who
are
going
to
fractionate
their
households
are
going
to
multiply
the
applications
that
are
necessary
to
get
them
into
the
program.
in
other
words,
take
the
hypothetical
i
gave
before.
if
there
is
a
group
of
voluntary
poor
people,
20
people
and
if
they
want
to
stay
in
the
food
stamp
program
all
they
have
to
do
is
separate
their
households
into
20
different
groups.
instead
of
making
a
program
easier
to
administer,
quite
the
contrary,
it
will
make
it
harder
to
administer.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no,
your
honor.
in
order
to,
in
order
to
include
yourself
as
a
--
as
a
--
in
order
to
get
yourself
excluded
from
the
group
that's
considered
for
a
household
purposes,
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
one
of
three
elements
are
missing.
element
one
is
that
you
don't
live
as
an
economic
unit
or
you
can
show
that
you
purchase
food
separately
or
you
can
show
that
you
have
separate
cooking
facilities.
so
if
anyone
of
those
different
--
if
anyone
of
those
different
factors
are
not
present
then
you
are
not
considered
a
grouping
for
household
purposes.
so
in
other
words
if
you
do
not
live
as
an
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
they
could
have
one
kitchen.
if
they
all
live
as
a
separate
economic
units
then
they
will
be
treated
as
20
different
households.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
they
had
even
one
kitchen,
as
long
as
they
live
as
20
separate
economic
units.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
in
other
words
in
other
words
they
don't
purchase
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
they
don't
purchase
food
in
common.
they
don't
purchase
their
--
they
don't
paid
any
utilities
in
common.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
if
someone
has
no
income
whatsoever,
but
one
has
a
meager
income
that
someone
like,
like
mrs.
moreno
has,
she
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
live
on
her
separate
income.
her
income
alone
is
33
cents
a
day
for
food,
that
is
if
she
purchases
no
clothing,
that
if
she
purchases
no
household
supplies,
that
if
she
purchases
no
hygienic
items.
she
must
combine
with
another
household
in
order
to
live.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor,
the
problem
is
that
in
many
states
you
cannot
get
relief.
in
order
to
get
relief
you
must
show
of
four
factors.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
the
food
stamp
program
was
intended
to
provide
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no
it
was
intended
to
provide
people
with
all
the
their
very
nutritional
needs.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that's
correct.
if
you
look
at
sections
201
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
because
what
you
are
actually
paying,
you
are
paying
your
normal
expenditures
for
food
under
the
program
and
your
coupon
allotment
that
you
receive
is
supposed
to
provide
you
with
nutritional
adequacy.
you
will
find
that
in
the
declaration
of
policy,
you
will
find
that
in
section
203,
2013(a),
2016(a).
all
of
those
provisions
say
that
the
coupon
allotment
in
the
food
stamp
program
is
supposed
to
provide
you
with
nutritional
adequacy.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
no
your
honor,
it
stems
first
from
the
statute
to
itself
2012(e)
and
knowles
actually
interprets
that
statute.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
can
anyone
do
that?
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well,
your
honor
--
because
if
you
take
a
look
as
an
example
at
mrs.
moreno,
she
just
cannot
get
nutritional
adequacy
if
she
used
just
her
money.
she
only
has,
even
if
she
doesn't
spend
a
single
penny
on
clothing,
not
a
single
penny
on
household
supplies,
not
a
single
penny
on
so
many
different
necessaries,
even
if
she
doesn't
make
expenditures
for
those
purposes
she
only
has
33
cents
per
day
for
food.
now
it
defies
my
imagination
your
honor
as
that
how
one
can
get
the
nutritionally
adequate
diet
with
only
33
cents
a
day.
so
what
she
does
is
she
combines
with
another
household
and
that
household
when
they
combine,
it
gives
them
a
greater
opportunity
to
obtain
an
adequate
nutritional
diet
and
it's
only
through
that
means
will
they
be
able
to
get
some
thing
like
better
nutrition.
if
she
does
it
alone
she
is
just
not
going
to
survive.
as
a
result
out
of
that
necessity,
since
she
did
combine,
she
has
denied
food
stamps.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
your
honor
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
if
she
purchased
her
food,
if
she
had
--
if
she
didn't
pool
her
resources
with
the
sanchez
family
that's
correct,
then
she
could
get
food
stamps.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
however,
in
order
to
survive
she
has
pooled
her
resources.
she
has
lived
as
one
economic
unit.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
the
knowles
decision
says
it
is
correct.
if
you
live
as
separate
economic
units
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that
is
one
of
the
indicia,
yes.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
if
she
could
do
it.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
your
honor,
there
are
other
needs
that
people
have
other
than
food
as
well
and
as
a
result
she
has
got
health
needs,
she
has
got
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
she
has.
she
certainly
does
have
those
needs.
however
in
order
to
satisfy
those
other
needs
it's
important
for
her
to
combine
her
resources
with
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
well
they
can't
aggregate
those
food
stamps
because
--
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
yes
they
can
have
a
common
kitchen,
but
they
can't
purchase
food
in
common.
mr.
ronald
f.
pollack
she
would
get
$36
in
food
stamps
per
