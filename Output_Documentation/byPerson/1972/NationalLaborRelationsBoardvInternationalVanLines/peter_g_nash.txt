mr.
peter
g.
nash
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
order
requiring
--
excuse
me,
requiring
the
reinstatement
of
four
employees
who
were
engaged
in
a
strike
when
they
were
discharged
by
their
employer.
the
question
presented
here
concerns
the
protection
which
the
national
labor
relations
act
affords
to
employees
engaged
in
a
strike
against
their
employer
for
an
economic
objective,
who
are
discharged
for
that
activity
before
they
have
been
permanently
replaced
by
that
employer.
thus
do,
such
strikers
have
an
unconditional
right
to
reinstatement
to
their
former
jobs
as
the
board
found
or
is
that
right
to
reinstatement
lost
if
the
employer
can
show
substantial
and
legitimate
business
justifications
for
refusing
to
reinstate
them
as
the
court
below
found.
the
facts
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
follows.
in
august
1967,
the
teamsters
union
commenced
an
organizing
campaign
amongst
the
employees
of
10
to
11
moving
and
storage
companies
within
the
santa
maria,
california
area
including
the
respondent,
international
van
lines.
on
september
21st,
the
union
that
had
obtained
authorization
cards
from
five
of
six
of
international's
employees
filed
a
representation
petition
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
a
copy
of
which
was
unserved
upon
the
company
and
received
by
it
on
september
25.
a
week
later
on
october
2nd
and
3rd,
this
union
held
meetings
at
which
the
union
representatives
told
the
employees
that
certain
companies
being
organized,
including
international
had
withdrawn
their
consent
for
an
nlrb
election.
there
was
also
some
discussion
at
that
time
about
the
discharge
of
employees
of
other
companies
other
than
--
than
international.
in
any
event,
the
assembled
employees
decided
to
strike
and
did
so
on
october
4th.
three
of
international's
employees,
dicus,
manuel
vasquez,
and
mr.
casillas
refused
to
cross
the
picket
line
and
the
fourth,
robert
vasquez
did
not
report
for
work
that
day
because
of
the
picket
line.
the
president
of
international,
robert
mcewan
obtained
temporary
replacements
the
next
day,
october
5th,
from
his
brother
who
had
a
similar
moving
and
storage
company
within
the
area
and
sent
telegrams
to
manuel
and
robert
vasquez
and
dicus
advising
them
that
they
had
been
permanently
replaced.
seven
days
later,
on
october
12,
the
union
filed
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
alleging
that
manuel
and
robert
vasquez,
casillas,
and
dicus
had
all
been
discriminatorily
discharged
in
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
between
october
8th
and
october
28th,
dicus
and
manuel
vasquez
each
asked
the
president
of
the
company,
mr.
mcewan,
who
was
then
hospitalized
whether
each
was
going
to
have
a
job
and
neither
received
any
commitment.
dicus
had
the
same
experience
shortly
after
mr.
mcewan
left
the
hospital
on
october
28th.
in
the
latter
part
of
november,
casillas
who
had
prior
to
that
time,
a
casual
worker,
asked
mr.
mcewan
to
put
him
back
on
the
availability
list
for
call.
he
received
no
particular
commitment
and
he
has
not
or
had
not
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
been
recalled
to
work.
on
october
12th,
manuel
and
robert
vasquez
and
dicus
asked
mr.
mcewan
to
be
reinstated
and
were
refused.
the
strike
continued
on
at
least
through
the
hearing
which
commenced
on
april
3,
1968.
the
board
found
that
the
company's
employees
were
engaged
in
a
protected
strike
to
compel
a
consent
election
and
that
even
if
the
objected
strike
was
to
compel
immediate
recognition
by
the
company,
of
the
union,
it
was
a
protected
strike.
further
the
board
found
that
manuel
and
robert
vasquez
and
dicus
were
discharged
by
the
telegram
sent
on
october
5th
for
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
not
been
permanently
replaced
at
that
time.
and
further,
that
all
four
employees
which
includes
--
included
casillas,
the
casual
employee,
were
refused
reinstatement
upon
their
unconditional
offers
or
applications
for
reinstatement
which
further
violated
sections
8
(a)
(3)
and
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board
ordered
reinstatement
of
all
four
of
these
employees
even
if
that
reinstatement
required
the
discharge
of
strike
replacements
which
may
or
may
not
had
been
hired
since
the
time
--
since
the
time
of
the
discharge
and
the
refusal
of
reinstatement
of
these
employees.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
all
four
of
the
employees
have
been
discharged
on
october
5
for
engaging
in
a
protected
strike
which
sought
a
consent
election,
but
none
had
been
permanently
replaced
up
until
that
time
and
that
as
such,
those
discharges
violated
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
court
further
found
that
the
three
of
the
strikers
excluding
casillas
at
this
point,
the
casual,
made
unconditional
request
for
reinstatement
which
were
denied.
and
that
casillas
had
made
a
similar
request,
but
because
he
was
a
casual
employee,
was
not
clear
to
the
ninth
circuit,
whether
in
fact
he
had
been
denied
reinstatement
or
whether
there
just
had
not
yet
been
an
opportunity
for
the
employer
to
call
him
back
to
work.
the
court
remanded
that
latter
--
that
latter
execution
to
the
board.
however,
despite
these
findings
and
despite
an
assumption
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
employees
who
struck
after
the
discharge
of
these
employees,
who
continued
their
strike,
might
in
fact
be
properly
considered
to
be
unfair
labor
practice
strikers.
the
court
held
that
the
discharge
strikers
remained
economic
strikers,
finding
that
to
be
their
status
at
the
time
they
were
in
fact
discharged.
accordingly,
although
these
employees
had
not
been
replaced
when
fired,
the
court
found
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
reinstatement
if
the
employer
had
a
legitimate
and
substantial
business
justification
for
refusing
to
reinstate
them
which
includes
the
hiring
of
permanent
replacement
since
the
--
since
their
discharge.
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
make
this
determination.
in
argument,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
discuss
initially
some
of
the
general
principles
involved
in
this
area
which
are
not,
in
my
judgment,
disputed.
thus,
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties
concerning
the
validity
of
the
consistently
recognized
distinction
between
the
reinstatement
rights
of
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
and
economic
strikers.
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
are
those
who
strike
activity,
either
begins
and
or
is
prolonged
or
aggravated
of
--
by
reaction
against
employer
of
unfair
labor
practices
and
economic
strikers
are
generally
everybody
else.
economic
strikers
are
entitled
to
reinstatement
at
the
end
of
their
strike
unless
the
employer
can
show
some
substantial
and
a
legitimate
business
justification
for
failing
to
reinstate
them
such
as
the
continuing
presence
of
permanent
replacers
--
replacements
in
their
jobs.
the
theory
here
is
that
although
the
employer
may
not
discriminate
against
those
strikers,
it
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
operating
his
business
during
the
strike
and
may
in
the
balancing
of
the
interest
and
equities
involved
obtain
permanent
replacements
for
those
strikers.
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
on
the
other
hand
are
entitled
to
unconditional
reinstatement
regardless
of
the
employer's
business
justification
for
not
reinstating
them
including
the
presence
of
permanent
replacements.
the
theory
here
is
that
such
strikers
are
acting
to
protect
themselves
against
the
illegal
acts
of
the
employer
which
violate
the
act.
and
although
the
employer
can
and
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
operating
his
business
during
the
strike,
he
may
not
penalize
his
employees
by
permanently
replacing
them
for
the
action
which
they've
taken
really
in
response
to
his
transgression.
further
elaborating
on
the
foregoing,
it's
also
clear
that
a
strike
that
starts
as
an
economic
strike
may
in
fact
become
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike,
thus
conferring
the
economic
strikers
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
where
the
employer's
commission
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
has
the
effect
of
prolonging
or
aggravating
a
strike.
and
finally
and
apart
from
the
discussion
of
unfair
labor
practice
and
economic
strike
of
that
distinction,
i
think
it
is
also
clear
that
the
discharge
of
economic
strikers
for
strike
absences
before
they
have
been
permanently
replaced
is
discrimination
and
violates
sections
8
(a)
(3)
and
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
as
i
say,
up
to
this
point,
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
respondent,
the
petitioner
nor
indeed
by
the
court
below.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
--
that
is
what
this
case
is
about
and
if
that
is
a
protected
--
protected
strike,
then
in
fact
he
has
under
all
previous
decisions
as
the
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that's
correct
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
does
--
do
not
necessarily
cease
to
be
an
employee
now.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
by
permanent
replacement,
that
--
that
is
correct.
he
may
not
fire
that
employee
and
if
he
fires
that
economic
striker,
he
fires
the
economic
striker
prior
to
the
time
that
that
striker
has
been
replaced,
then
that
striker
has
the
unconditional
right
to
return
to
his
job.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
well
that
issue
was
not
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
that
gets
into
the
questions
of
the
fleetwood
and
laidlaw
cases
which
extend
additional
--
additional
rights
to
economic
strikers,
even
replaced
economic
strikers,
the
right
to
go
on
a
seniority
register,
if
you
will,
and
be
called
back
other
than
discriminating
against
them
by
hiring
someone
in
their
place
later
on.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
full
extent
of
the
fleetwood
and
laidlaw
doctrine
to
the
board,
i
don't
think
had
been
fully
explicated
or
examined
either
by
--
by
this
court
or
by
the
board
and
i
--
that
issue
however
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
but
that
--
that
proceeded
by
--
by
some
number
of
years.
the
fleetwood
decision
of
this
court
and
the
ultimate
laidlaw
decision
of
the
board
which
gives
meaning
i
think
to
the
--
to
the
fleetwood.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
to
the
extent
that
mackay
indicated
that
perhaps
an
employee
could
be
discharged
and
his
employment
status
completely
eliminated
or
terminated
by
--
by
reasons
of
his
replacement
to
the
extent
of
the
dicta,
what
i
would
call
the
dicta
in
that
case
is
different
from
fleetwood,
yes.
i
think
it's
implicitly
an
extension
of
rights.
the
court
below,
however,
did
find
in
this
case
that
all
--
all
four
of
the
strikers
were
discharged
before
they
had
been
permanent
--
permanently
replaced,
they
could
not,
as
a
matter
of
law
require
any
greater
reinstatement
rights
than
those
of
economic
strikers,
for
that
was
a
status
that
they
had
held
at
the
time
of
their
discharge.
and
this
is
true
in
the
ninth
circuit's
view
even
if
those
discharges
converted
the
strike
in
question
and
the
strikers,
the
non-discharge
strikers
in
the
unfair
--
into
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
and
then
into
an
unfair
labor
practice
group
of
strikers.
i
think
that
the
court's
position
is
erroneous
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
wholly
apart
from
whether
the
four
dischargees
became
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
are
not,
the
respondent,
because
of
its
action
and
unlawfully
discharging
them
has
an
unconditional
obligation
to
reinstate
them.
a
classic
remedy
for
an
unlawful
discharge
of
an
employee
is
unconditional
reinstatement
for
that's
the
best
way
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante.
this
holds
true
whether
the
dischargee
was
unlawfully
discharged
from
active
duty
or
whether
he's
unlawfully
discharged
from
a
picket
line
before
he
had
been
replaced.
in
the
latter
case,
the
striker
not
having
been
replaced
at
that
time
--
at
the
time
of
his
wrongful
discharge
had
an
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work.
he
was
terminated
from
that
position
and
in
order
to
replace
and
put
things
back
into
status
quo,
that
wrongfully
terminated
striker
should
be
in
the
same
position
that
he
was
in
before
he
was
discharged
which
is
the
position
of
an
economic
striker
with
an
unconditional
ability
to
return.
thus,
the
circuits
have
uniformly
held
that
without
regard
to
whether
the
strikes
subsequently
takes
on
the
nature
of
a
protest
against
an
employer's
unfair
labor
practice,
that
that
employer
may
not
lawfully
terminate
economic
strikers
prior
to
the
time
they've
been
validly
replaced
and
that
the
appropriate
remedy
therefore
is
reinstatement
even
if
that
requires
the
displacement
of
post-firing
replacements.
just
as
an
employer
may
not
deny
reinstatement
to
an
employee
unlawfully
discharged
while
he
is
actively
working
on
the
grounds
that
he
subsequently
replaced
that
discharged
employee,
so
too
a
striking
employee
can
have
no
less
protection.
to
hold
otherwise,
i
think
would
be
to
recognize
a
distinction
between
non-strike
concerted
activities
protected
by
section
7
on
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
strike
activities
similarly
protected.
congress
did
not
authorize
such
a
distinction
to
be
made
and
rightly
so
or
no
one
can
deny
that
the
right
to
legally
strike
is
one
of
the
paramount
protected
activities
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
indeed
congress
so
recognized
specifically
in
passing
section
13
of
that
act.
secondly,
and
contrary
to
the
court
below,
the
board
could
properly
find
that
by
continuing
to
strike
after
their
unlawful
discharge,
the
four
dischargees
in
this
case
became
unfair
labor
practice
strikers.
it
is
i
submit
a
reasonable
inference
for
the
board
to
make
that
the
dischargees
had
added
to
their
protest
against
their
employer,
their
unlawful
discharge.
and
further
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
of
firing
a
striker
has
such
an
effect
upon
a
strike
is
to
tend
to
prolong
it.
at
the
very
least,
the
board
in
the
exercise
of
its
expertise
may,
i
submit,
properly
conclude
that
the
discriminatory
and
unlawful
discharge
of
strikers
is
so
likely
to
have
an
impact
upon
the
strike
itself
that
such
an
act
by
the
employer
shifts
the
burden
to
that
employer
to
show
that
the
strike
was
not
in
fact
impacted
by
the
illegal
discharges.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
the
second
part
of
the
argument
here
and
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
quite
clearly
that
it
did
have
an
effect
upon
the
prolongation
of
the
strike
and
certainly
upon
the
prolongation
of
the
strike
by
these
four
employees,
who
in
fact
they
unconditionally
asked
to
be
reinstated
were
denied
that
request
and
continued
on
strike
and
that
was
back
in
december
of
1967
and
continued
as
strikers
at
least
on
through
april
3,
1968.
so
that
i
think
without
--
without
question
at
least
as
to
those
four
particular
employees,
the
strike
--
strike
continued
well
on
as
it
would
have
had
their
original
grievance
been
resolved.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
record
indicates
that
some
of
the
employees
--
some
of
these
four
employees
did
know
--
one
of
them
at
least
was
present
at
the
meeting
with
the
union
of
which
the
employers
believed
withdrawal
of
his
consent
to
a
board
election
was
one
of
the
circumstances
that
brought
to
the
strike.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
well,
no.
the
court
of
appeals
merely
said
that
even
assuming
that
this
is
an
unfair
--
that
this
now
becomes
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
after
you've
discharged
these
four
employees,
because
the
four
employees
were
themselves,
economic
strikers
at
the
time
they
are
discharged,
there
was
no
way
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
matter
what
the
board
may
show,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
those
four
people
can
ever
become
other
than
economic
strikers
because
that's
the
status
that
they
held
at
the
time
that
they
were
discharged.
and
my
complaint
that
i
bring
to
you
today
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
as
wrong
as
it
can
be
in
making
that
kind
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
are
wrong.
that
not
only
do
those
employees
under
the
facts
in
this
case
become
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
with
full
rights
to
reinstatement,
but
furthermore,
even
if
they
are
economic
strikers
at
the
--
and
remain
economic
strikers,
they
are
fired
economic
strikers
who
at
the
time
they
were
fired,
had
not
been
replaced
by
anyone
else
and
thus
must
be
--
and
thus
had
the
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work
on
that
day
because
they
hadn't
been
replaced
and
that
the
appropriate
remedy
for
that
situation
is
to
put
them
back
into
the
situation
they
were
in
when
they
were
discharged
which
is
an
unconditional
right
to
reinstatement
regardless
of
what
happened
after
the
day
that
they
were
discharged.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
oh
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
they
were
permanently
replaced
before
an
unfair
labor
practice
occurred.
that
is
--
it
was
not
presented
in
this
case
but
in
my
judgment,
they
would
then
be
permanently
replaced
economic
strikers
who
would
have
--
would
not
have
the
unconditional
right
to
return.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
if
--
if
there
is
in
fact
to
be
a
conversion
rather
than
the
strike
starting
it
initially
as
an
unfair
labor
--
yes,
there
must
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
then
there
becomes
--
they
become
unfair
labor
practice
strikers.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
because
they
weren't
fired
until
the
second
day
of
the
strike.
initially,
they
could
not
have
been
obviously
objecting
to
their
discharge
because
they
hadn't
yet
been
discharged.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
they
could
very
well
have
been
dual
purpose
strikers
in
which
event
they
would
be
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
unless
the
employer
can
come
forward
i
believe
with
compelling
evidence
to
disentangle
the
morass
that
he
himself
has
caused
by
committing
unfair
labor
practices
and
shown
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
strike
or
the
prolongation
of
the
strike.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
had
they
been
permanently
replaced?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
they
would
be
--
at
the
time
they
were
fired.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
answer
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
this
extent,
when
i
mean
they're
out,
i
mean
they
are
then
replaced
economic
strikers
at
the
time
that
they
are
fired
and
they
would
be
returned
to
the
position
that
replaced
economic
strikers
which
would
mean
that
they
don't
have
the
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work
but
may
have
the
subsequent
fleetwood
and
laidlaw
rights
which
would
be
the
rights
to
come
back
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
right,
when
all
things
in
fact
do
--
do
occur.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
employer
--
yes
i
think
strictly
speaking,
yes.
the
employer
has
a
right
during
an
economic
strike
to
permanently
replace
striker.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
employer
does
that,
he
commits
no
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
if
the
next
day
he
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
well
first
of
all
he
doesn't
commit
it
by
employing
a
permanent
replacement.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
now,
if
on
the
next
day
he
fires
a
striker
even
though
he's
been
replaced,
he
commits
a
violation
of
the
act.
he
violates
section
8
(a)
(3)
as
discriminatorily
discharges
a
striker.
he
has
taken
away
whatever
rights
fleetwood
and
laidlaw
may
give
him.
at
the
time,
let's
assume
no
discharge
on
the
second
day,
the
strike
ends
and
the
employees
says
--
and
the
strikers
says,
“i
now
want
to
come
back
to
work.”
the
employer
then
says,
“you
have
no
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work
because
you
were
replaced,
permanently
replaced.
you'll
go
on
a
laidlaw
list
if
you
will
and
when
an
opening
occurs
i
will
be
--
i
will
be
calling
you
under
those
circumstances.”
and
although
that
issue
is
not
present
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
violation
in
the
refusal
to
reinstate
at
that
point.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
case
on
the
books
but
in
a
different
capacity
as
general
counsel,
as
an
investigator
and
prosecutor
of
unfair
labor
practices,
i
would
look
carefully
of
that
set
of
events
that
you
just
told
to
see
if
in
fact
that
that
was
not
a
ruse
and
what
was
not
in
fact
intended
was
a
discharge
before
replacement
in
those
circumstances.
and
there
might
well
--
very
well
under
the
facts
of
that
case
be
found
to
be
a
violation.
but
given
a
clean
permanent
replacement
and
subsequently
refusal
to
reinstate,
there
would
not
in
my
judgment
be
a
violation.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
right,
i
think
the
only
general
principle
is
that
you
can't
discriminate
against
people
because
they
exercise
their
rights
under
section
7
of
the
act
and
that
whether
there's
discrimination
or
not
obviously
involves
a
factual
question
on
each
case.
i
think
the
problem
--
the
problem
with
this
case
and
the
problem
created
by
this
case
can
best
--
can
best
be
put
in
focus
by
--
by
a
practical
hypothetical.
under
the
circumstances
now
allowed
by
the
ninth
circuit
an
employer
during
an
economic
strike
fire
all
of
his
economic
strikers.
at
that
point
if
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
stood,
those
employees
would
have
no
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work
unless
they
immediately
came
in
and
said
to
the
employer,
“we
want
to
come
back
to
work
unconditionally
at
this
point”,
before
they've
been
permanently
replaced.
that
adds
an
additional
risk,
the
risk
of
an
unfair
--
the
risk
of
an
economic
striker
which
i
don't
think
is
justified
in
law
nor
by
any
of
the
decisions
prior
to
the
time
that
the
ninth
circuit
came
down
with
this
decision.
it
adds
an
additional
risk
that
the
employees
must
immediately
come
back
and
the
strikers
must
immediately
come
back
in
and
say,
“we
give
up
our
strike.
we
want
to
come
back
to
work.”
a
risk
that
they
don't
have
as
economic
strikers,
for
although
they
might
be
permanently
replaced,
the
day
of
that
replacement
has
not
come
to
their
attention
immediately,
they
don't
feel
that
kind
of
compunction
to
give
up
their
strike
and
i
submit
to
allow
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
to
stand
in
essence
means
that
an
employer
can
break
strikes
by
violating
the
act.
thank
you
very
much.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
may
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
order
requiring
--
excuse
me,
requiring
the
reinstatement
of
four
employees
who
were
engaged
in
a
strike
when
they
were
discharged
by
their
employer.
the
question
presented
here
concerns
the
protection
which
the
national
labor
relations
act
affords
to
employees
engaged
in
a
strike
against
their
employer
for
an
economic
objective,
who
are
discharged
for
that
activity
before
they
have
been
permanently
replaced
by
that
employer.
thus
do,
such
strikers
have
an
unconditional
right
to
reinstatement
to
their
former
jobs
as
the
board
found
or
is
that
right
to
reinstatement
lost
if
the
employer
can
show
substantial
and
legitimate
business
justifications
for
refusing
to
reinstate
them
as
the
court
below
found.
the
facts
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
follows.
in
august
1967,
the
teamsters
union
commenced
an
organizing
campaign
amongst
the
employees
of
10
to
11
moving
and
storage
companies
within
the
santa
maria,
california
area
including
the
respondent,
international
van
lines.
on
september
21st,
the
union
that
had
obtained
authorization
cards
from
five
of
six
of
international's
employees
filed
a
representation
petition
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
a
copy
of
which
was
unserved
upon
the
company
and
received
by
it
on
september
25.
a
week
later
on
october
2nd
and
3rd,
this
union
held
meetings
at
which
the
union
representatives
told
the
employees
that
certain
companies
being
organized,
including
international
had
withdrawn
their
consent
for
an
nlrb
election.
there
was
also
some
discussion
at
that
time
about
the
discharge
of
employees
of
other
companies
other
than
--
than
international.
in
any
event,
the
assembled
employees
decided
to
strike
and
did
so
on
october
4th.
three
of
international's
employees,
dicus,
manuel
vasquez,
and
mr.
casillas
refused
to
cross
the
picket
line
and
the
fourth,
robert
vasquez
did
not
report
for
work
that
day
because
of
the
picket
line.
the
president
of
international,
robert
mcewan
obtained
temporary
replacements
the
next
day,
october
5th,
from
his
brother
who
had
a
similar
moving
and
storage
company
within
the
area
and
sent
telegrams
to
manuel
and
robert
vasquez
and
dicus
advising
them
that
they
had
been
permanently
replaced.
seven
days
later,
on
october
12,
the
union
filed
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
alleging
that
manuel
and
robert
vasquez,
casillas,
and
dicus
had
all
been
discriminatorily
discharged
in
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
between
october
8th
and
october
28th,
dicus
and
manuel
vasquez
each
asked
the
president
of
the
company,
mr.
mcewan,
who
was
then
hospitalized
whether
each
was
going
to
have
a
job
and
neither
received
any
commitment.
dicus
had
the
same
experience
shortly
after
mr.
mcewan
left
the
hospital
on
october
28th.
in
the
latter
part
of
november,
casillas
who
had
prior
to
that
time,
a
casual
worker,
asked
mr.
mcewan
to
put
him
back
on
the
availability
list
for
call.
he
received
no
particular
commitment
and
he
has
not
or
had
not
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
been
recalled
to
work.
on
october
12th,
manuel
and
robert
vasquez
and
dicus
asked
mr.
mcewan
to
be
reinstated
and
were
refused.
the
strike
continued
on
at
least
through
the
hearing
which
commenced
on
april
3,
1968.
the
board
found
that
the
company's
employees
were
engaged
in
a
protected
strike
to
compel
a
consent
election
and
that
even
if
the
objected
strike
was
to
compel
immediate
recognition
by
the
company,
of
the
union,
it
was
a
protected
strike.
further
the
board
found
that
manuel
and
robert
vasquez
and
dicus
were
discharged
by
the
telegram
sent
on
october
5th
for
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
not
been
permanently
replaced
at
that
time.
and
further,
that
all
four
employees
which
includes
--
included
casillas,
the
casual
employee,
were
refused
reinstatement
upon
their
unconditional
offers
or
applications
for
reinstatement
which
further
violated
sections
8
(a)
(3)
and
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board
ordered
reinstatement
of
all
four
of
these
employees
even
if
that
reinstatement
required
the
discharge
of
strike
replacements
which
may
or
may
not
had
been
hired
since
the
time
--
since
the
time
of
the
discharge
and
the
refusal
of
reinstatement
of
these
employees.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
all
four
of
the
employees
have
been
discharged
on
october
5
for
engaging
in
a
protected
strike
which
sought
a
consent
election,
but
none
had
been
permanently
replaced
up
until
that
time
and
that
as
such,
those
discharges
violated
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
court
further
found
that
the
three
of
the
strikers
excluding
casillas
at
this
point,
the
casual,
made
unconditional
request
for
reinstatement
which
were
denied.
and
that
casillas
had
made
a
similar
request,
but
because
he
was
a
casual
employee,
was
not
clear
to
the
ninth
circuit,
whether
in
fact
he
had
been
denied
reinstatement
or
whether
there
just
had
not
yet
been
an
opportunity
for
the
employer
to
call
him
back
to
work.
the
court
remanded
that
latter
--
that
latter
execution
to
the
board.
however,
despite
these
findings
and
despite
an
assumption
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
employees
who
struck
after
the
discharge
of
these
employees,
who
continued
their
strike,
might
in
fact
be
properly
considered
to
be
unfair
labor
practice
strikers.
the
court
held
that
the
discharge
strikers
remained
economic
strikers,
finding
that
to
be
their
status
at
the
time
they
were
in
fact
discharged.
accordingly,
although
these
employees
had
not
been
replaced
when
fired,
the
court
found
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
reinstatement
if
the
employer
had
a
legitimate
and
substantial
business
justification
for
refusing
to
reinstate
them
which
includes
the
hiring
of
permanent
replacement
since
the
--
since
their
discharge.
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
make
this
determination.
in
argument,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
discuss
initially
some
of
the
general
principles
involved
in
this
area
which
are
not,
in
my
judgment,
disputed.
thus,
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties
concerning
the
validity
of
the
consistently
recognized
distinction
between
the
reinstatement
rights
of
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
and
economic
strikers.
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
are
those
who
strike
activity,
either
begins
and
or
is
prolonged
or
aggravated
of
--
by
reaction
against
employer
of
unfair
labor
practices
and
economic
strikers
are
generally
everybody
else.
economic
strikers
are
entitled
to
reinstatement
at
the
end
of
their
strike
unless
the
employer
can
show
some
substantial
and
a
legitimate
business
justification
for
failing
to
reinstate
them
such
as
the
continuing
presence
of
permanent
replacers
--
replacements
in
their
jobs.
the
theory
here
is
that
although
the
employer
may
not
discriminate
against
those
strikers,
it
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
operating
his
business
during
the
strike
and
may
in
the
balancing
of
the
interest
and
equities
involved
obtain
permanent
replacements
for
those
strikers.
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
on
the
other
hand
are
entitled
to
unconditional
reinstatement
regardless
of
the
employer's
business
justification
for
not
reinstating
them
including
the
presence
of
permanent
replacements.
the
theory
here
is
that
such
strikers
are
acting
to
protect
themselves
against
the
illegal
acts
of
the
employer
which
violate
the
act.
and
although
the
employer
can
and
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
operating
his
business
during
the
strike,
he
may
not
penalize
his
employees
by
permanently
replacing
them
for
the
action
which
they've
taken
really
in
response
to
his
transgression.
further
elaborating
on
the
foregoing,
it's
also
clear
that
a
strike
that
starts
as
an
economic
strike
may
in
fact
become
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike,
thus
conferring
the
economic
strikers
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
where
the
employer's
commission
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
has
the
effect
of
prolonging
or
aggravating
a
strike.
and
finally
and
apart
from
the
discussion
of
unfair
labor
practice
and
economic
strike
of
that
distinction,
i
think
it
is
also
clear
that
the
discharge
of
economic
strikers
for
strike
absences
before
they
have
been
permanently
replaced
is
discrimination
and
violates
sections
8
(a)
(3)
and
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
as
i
say,
up
to
this
point,
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
respondent,
the
petitioner
nor
indeed
by
the
court
below.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
--
that
is
what
this
case
is
about
and
if
that
is
a
protected
--
protected
strike,
then
in
fact
he
has
under
all
previous
decisions
as
the
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that's
correct
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
does
--
do
not
necessarily
cease
to
be
an
employee
now.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
by
permanent
replacement,
that
--
that
is
correct.
he
may
not
fire
that
employee
and
if
he
fires
that
economic
striker,
he
fires
the
economic
striker
prior
to
the
time
that
that
striker
has
been
replaced,
then
that
striker
has
the
unconditional
right
to
return
to
his
job.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
well
that
issue
was
not
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
that
gets
into
the
questions
of
the
fleetwood
and
laidlaw
cases
which
extend
additional
--
additional
rights
to
economic
strikers,
even
replaced
economic
strikers,
the
right
to
go
on
a
seniority
register,
if
you
will,
and
be
called
back
other
than
discriminating
against
them
by
hiring
someone
in
their
place
later
on.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
full
extent
of
the
fleetwood
and
laidlaw
doctrine
to
the
board,
i
don't
think
had
been
fully
explicated
or
examined
either
by
--
by
this
court
or
by
the
board
and
i
--
that
issue
however
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
but
that
--
that
proceeded
by
--
by
some
number
of
years.
the
fleetwood
decision
of
this
court
and
the
ultimate
laidlaw
decision
of
the
board
which
gives
meaning
i
think
to
the
--
to
the
fleetwood.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
to
the
extent
that
mackay
indicated
that
perhaps
an
employee
could
be
discharged
and
his
employment
status
completely
eliminated
or
terminated
by
--
by
reasons
of
his
replacement
to
the
extent
of
the
dicta,
what
i
would
call
the
dicta
in
that
case
is
different
from
fleetwood,
yes.
i
think
it's
implicitly
an
extension
of
rights.
the
court
below,
however,
did
find
in
this
case
that
all
--
all
four
of
the
strikers
were
discharged
before
they
had
been
permanent
--
permanently
replaced,
they
could
not,
as
a
matter
of
law
require
any
greater
reinstatement
rights
than
those
of
economic
strikers,
for
that
was
a
status
that
they
had
held
at
the
time
of
their
discharge.
and
this
is
true
in
the
ninth
circuit's
view
even
if
those
discharges
converted
the
strike
in
question
and
the
strikers,
the
non-discharge
strikers
in
the
unfair
--
into
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
and
then
into
an
unfair
labor
practice
group
of
strikers.
i
think
that
the
court's
position
is
erroneous
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
wholly
apart
from
whether
the
four
dischargees
became
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
are
not,
the
respondent,
because
of
its
action
and
unlawfully
discharging
them
has
an
unconditional
obligation
to
reinstate
them.
a
classic
remedy
for
an
unlawful
discharge
of
an
employee
is
unconditional
reinstatement
for
that's
the
best
way
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante.
this
holds
true
whether
the
dischargee
was
unlawfully
discharged
from
active
duty
or
whether
he's
unlawfully
discharged
from
a
picket
line
before
he
had
been
replaced.
in
the
latter
case,
the
striker
not
having
been
replaced
at
that
time
--
at
the
time
of
his
wrongful
discharge
had
an
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work.
he
was
terminated
from
that
position
and
in
order
to
replace
and
put
things
back
into
status
quo,
that
wrongfully
terminated
striker
should
be
in
the
same
position
that
he
was
in
before
he
was
discharged
which
is
the
position
of
an
economic
striker
with
an
unconditional
ability
to
return.
thus,
the
circuits
have
uniformly
held
that
without
regard
to
whether
the
strikes
subsequently
takes
on
the
nature
of
a
protest
against
an
employer's
unfair
labor
practice,
that
that
employer
may
not
lawfully
terminate
economic
strikers
prior
to
the
time
they've
been
validly
replaced
and
that
the
appropriate
remedy
therefore
is
reinstatement
even
if
that
requires
the
displacement
of
post-firing
replacements.
just
as
an
employer
may
not
deny
reinstatement
to
an
employee
unlawfully
discharged
while
he
is
actively
working
on
the
grounds
that
he
subsequently
replaced
that
discharged
employee,
so
too
a
striking
employee
can
have
no
less
protection.
to
hold
otherwise,
i
think
would
be
to
recognize
a
distinction
between
non-strike
concerted
activities
protected
by
section
7
on
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
strike
activities
similarly
protected.
congress
did
not
authorize
such
a
distinction
to
be
made
and
rightly
so
or
no
one
can
deny
that
the
right
to
legally
strike
is
one
of
the
paramount
protected
activities
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
indeed
congress
so
recognized
specifically
in
passing
section
13
of
that
act.
secondly,
and
contrary
to
the
court
below,
the
board
could
properly
find
that
by
continuing
to
strike
after
their
unlawful
discharge,
the
four
dischargees
in
this
case
became
unfair
labor
practice
strikers.
it
is
i
submit
a
reasonable
inference
for
the
board
to
make
that
the
dischargees
had
added
to
their
protest
against
their
employer,
their
unlawful
discharge.
and
further
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
of
firing
a
striker
has
such
an
effect
upon
a
strike
is
to
tend
to
prolong
it.
at
the
very
least,
the
board
in
the
exercise
of
its
expertise
may,
i
submit,
properly
conclude
that
the
discriminatory
and
unlawful
discharge
of
strikers
is
so
likely
to
have
an
impact
upon
the
strike
itself
that
such
an
act
by
the
employer
shifts
the
burden
to
that
employer
to
show
that
the
strike
was
not
in
fact
impacted
by
the
illegal
discharges.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
the
second
part
of
the
argument
here
and
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
quite
clearly
that
it
did
have
an
effect
upon
the
prolongation
of
the
strike
and
certainly
upon
the
prolongation
of
the
strike
by
these
four
employees,
who
in
fact
they
unconditionally
asked
to
be
reinstated
were
denied
that
request
and
continued
on
strike
and
that
was
back
in
december
of
1967
and
continued
as
strikers
at
least
on
through
april
3,
1968.
so
that
i
think
without
--
without
question
at
least
as
to
those
four
particular
employees,
the
strike
--
strike
continued
well
on
as
it
would
have
had
their
original
grievance
been
resolved.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
record
indicates
that
some
of
the
employees
--
some
of
these
four
employees
did
know
--
one
of
them
at
least
was
present
at
the
meeting
with
the
union
of
which
the
employers
believed
withdrawal
of
his
consent
to
a
board
election
was
one
of
the
circumstances
that
brought
to
the
strike.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
well,
no.
the
court
of
appeals
merely
said
that
even
assuming
that
this
is
an
unfair
--
that
this
now
becomes
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
after
you've
discharged
these
four
employees,
because
the
four
employees
were
themselves,
economic
strikers
at
the
time
they
are
discharged,
there
was
no
way
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
matter
what
the
board
may
show,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
those
four
people
can
ever
become
other
than
economic
strikers
because
that's
the
status
that
they
held
at
the
time
that
they
were
discharged.
and
my
complaint
that
i
bring
to
you
today
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
as
wrong
as
it
can
be
in
making
that
kind
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
are
wrong.
that
not
only
do
those
employees
under
the
facts
in
this
case
become
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
with
full
rights
to
reinstatement,
but
furthermore,
even
if
they
are
economic
strikers
at
the
--
and
remain
economic
strikers,
they
are
fired
economic
strikers
who
at
the
time
they
were
fired,
had
not
been
replaced
by
anyone
else
and
thus
must
be
--
and
thus
had
the
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work
on
that
day
because
they
hadn't
been
replaced
and
that
the
appropriate
remedy
for
that
situation
is
to
put
them
back
into
the
situation
they
were
in
when
they
were
discharged
which
is
an
unconditional
right
to
reinstatement
regardless
of
what
happened
after
the
day
that
they
were
discharged.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
oh
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
they
were
permanently
replaced
before
an
unfair
labor
practice
occurred.
that
is
--
it
was
not
presented
in
this
case
but
in
my
judgment,
they
would
then
be
permanently
replaced
economic
strikers
who
would
have
--
would
not
have
the
unconditional
right
to
return.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
if
--
if
there
is
in
fact
to
be
a
conversion
rather
than
the
strike
starting
it
initially
as
an
unfair
labor
--
yes,
there
must
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
then
there
becomes
--
they
become
unfair
labor
practice
strikers.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
because
they
weren't
fired
until
the
second
day
of
the
strike.
initially,
they
could
not
have
been
obviously
objecting
to
their
discharge
because
they
hadn't
yet
been
discharged.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
they
could
very
well
have
been
dual
purpose
strikers
in
which
event
they
would
be
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
unless
the
employer
can
come
forward
i
believe
with
compelling
evidence
to
disentangle
the
morass
that
he
himself
has
caused
by
committing
unfair
labor
practices
and
shown
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
strike
or
the
prolongation
of
the
strike.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
had
they
been
permanently
replaced?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
they
would
be
--
at
the
time
they
were
fired.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
answer
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
this
extent,
when
i
mean
they're
out,
i
mean
they
are
then
replaced
economic
strikers
at
the
time
that
they
are
fired
and
they
would
be
returned
to
the
position
that
replaced
economic
strikers
which
would
mean
that
they
don't
have
the
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work
but
may
have
the
subsequent
fleetwood
and
laidlaw
rights
which
would
be
the
rights
to
come
back
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
right,
when
all
things
in
fact
do
--
do
occur.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
employer
--
yes
i
think
strictly
speaking,
yes.
the
employer
has
a
right
during
an
economic
strike
to
permanently
replace
striker.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
employer
does
that,
he
commits
no
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
if
the
next
day
he
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
well
first
of
all
he
doesn't
commit
it
by
employing
a
permanent
replacement.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
now,
if
on
the
next
day
he
fires
a
striker
even
though
he's
been
replaced,
he
commits
a
violation
of
the
act.
he
violates
section
8
(a)
(3)
as
discriminatorily
discharges
a
striker.
he
has
taken
away
whatever
rights
fleetwood
and
laidlaw
may
give
him.
at
the
time,
let's
assume
no
discharge
on
the
second
day,
the
strike
ends
and
the
employees
says
--
and
the
strikers
says,
“i
now
want
to
come
back
to
work.”
the
employer
then
says,
“you
have
no
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work
because
you
were
replaced,
permanently
replaced.
you'll
go
on
a
laidlaw
list
if
you
will
and
when
an
opening
occurs
i
will
be
--
i
will
be
calling
you
under
those
circumstances.”
and
although
that
issue
is
not
present
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
violation
in
the
refusal
to
reinstate
at
that
point.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
case
on
the
books
but
in
a
different
capacity
as
general
counsel,
as
an
investigator
and
prosecutor
of
unfair
labor
practices,
i
would
look
carefully
of
that
set
of
events
that
you
just
told
to
see
if
in
fact
that
that
was
not
a
ruse
and
what
was
not
in
fact
intended
was
a
discharge
before
replacement
in
those
circumstances.
and
there
might
well
--
very
well
under
the
facts
of
that
case
be
found
to
be
a
violation.
but
given
a
clean
permanent
replacement
and
subsequently
refusal
to
reinstate,
there
would
not
in
my
judgment
be
a
violation.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
right,
i
think
the
only
general
principle
is
that
you
can't
discriminate
against
people
because
they
exercise
their
rights
under
section
7
of
the
act
and
that
whether
there's
discrimination
or
not
obviously
involves
a
factual
question
on
each
case.
i
think
the
problem
--
the
problem
with
this
case
and
the
problem
created
by
this
case
can
best
--
can
best
be
put
in
focus
by
--
by
a
practical
hypothetical.
under
the
circumstances
now
allowed
by
the
ninth
circuit
an
employer
during
an
economic
strike
fire
all
of
his
economic
strikers.
at
that
point
if
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
stood,
those
employees
would
have
no
unconditional
right
to
return
to
work
unless
they
immediately
came
in
and
said
to
the
employer,
“we
want
to
come
back
to
work
unconditionally
at
this
point”,
before
they've
been
permanently
replaced.
that
adds
an
additional
risk,
the
risk
of
an
unfair
--
the
risk
of
an
economic
striker
which
i
don't
think
is
justified
in
law
nor
by
any
of
the
decisions
prior
to
the
time
that
the
ninth
circuit
came
down
with
this
decision.
it
adds
an
additional
risk
that
the
employees
must
immediately
come
back
and
the
strikers
must
immediately
come
back
in
and
say,
“we
give
up
our
strike.
we
want
to
come
back
to
work.”
a
risk
that
they
don't
have
as
economic
strikers,
for
although
they
might
be
permanently
replaced,
the
day
of
that
replacement
has
not
come
to
their
attention
immediately,
they
don't
feel
that
kind
of
compunction
to
give
up
their
strike
and
i
submit
to
allow
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
to
stand
in
essence
means
that
an
employer
can
break
strikes
by
violating
the
act.
thank
you
very
much.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
may
for
rebuttal.
