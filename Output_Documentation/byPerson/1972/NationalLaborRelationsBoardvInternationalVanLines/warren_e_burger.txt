mr.
nash,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
difference
as
to
the
time
when
the
claimed
unfair
labor
practice
occurred
in
relation
to
the
time
of
their
conversion
from
an
economic
--
being
economic
strikers
to
unfair
labor
practice
strikers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
were
replaced
before
any
unfair
labor
practice
occurred.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
their
--
their
conversion,
if
we
can
call
it
that,
must
relate
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
had
existed
while
they
were
economic
strikers,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
--
in
effect
then
could
it
be
said
that
they
were
striking
in
a
dual
capacity
from
the
outset
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
suppose
there
was
some
other
kind
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
would
be
entirely
a
factual
determination,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
you
couldn't
have
a
general
rule
about
that,
could
you?
except
that
subterfuge
--
to
the
extent
that
it'd
be
a
principle
that
subterfuge
would
be
penetrated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
nash.
mr.
kirshman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
telegram
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
telegrams
that
were
sent
to
them
said,
“you
are
being
permanently
--
you
are
being
replaced.”
they
were
speaking
of
the
future
time,
so
that
--
unless
they
did
something
after
that
to
clarify
it,
we
have
a
very
muddy
picture,
haven't
we?
