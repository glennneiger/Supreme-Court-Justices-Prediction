unknown
speaker
is
that
true
even
though
or
is
that
what
this
case
is
about
even
though
a
person
who
is
fired
before
he
is
permanently
replaced
is
--
what
if
he
is
fired
but
then
permanently
replaced?
unknown
speaker
he
does
--
he
does
seem
to
be
an
employee
until
he
is
permanently
replaced,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
--
terminate
him
is
by
a
replacement?
unknown
speaker
if
he
replaces
him
permanently,
then
he
may
say
to
him,
“you're
fired”?
unknown
speaker
if
they
--
if
they
never
really
completely
terminate
the
right,
is
that
total
replacement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nash,
in
answering
the
chief
justice,
you
suggested
and
hypothetically
gave
that
had
they
been
replaced
by
--
before
the
discharge,
then
that
would
be
it.
there
would
be
no
unfair
labor
practice
and
they'd
be
out.
unknown
speaker
yes,
they'd
be
out.
unknown
speaker
yes.
my
question,
how
--
how
is
that
consistent
with
the
answer
you
gave
mr.
justice
rehnquist
before
as
to
the
effect
of
fleetwood
and
this
board
case
on
mackay?
unknown
speaker
seniority
list
or
something.
unknown
speaker
he
commits
it
by
--
no
violation
by
what?
by
not
employing
the
--
reemploying
the
striker?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
it
really
as
simple
as
chronology
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
to
the
discharge
happening
on
one
day
and
replacement
being
employed
the
next
day.
suppose
it
went
that
of
an
hour
or
ten
minutes,
any
principles
involved
or
does
it
just
depend
on
whether
the
employer
were
smart
enough
to
say,
“i
hire
you
to
replace
john
smith”
and
then
advices
john
smith,
“you
are
fired”
or
whether
he
reverses
that
process?
unknown
speaker
were
these
employees
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
could
an
employer
--
how
could
an
employer
refuse
to
reinstate
a
striker
if
he
hadn't
been
permanently
replaced?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
difference
could
it
make
when
they
apply
it,
if
they
hadn't
been
permanently
replaced?
unknown
speaker
well,
until
they've
been
permanently
replaced
they've
got
a
right
to
reinstatement.
unknown
speaker
are
these
people
in
this
case
entitled
to
reinstatement
absent
a
finding
if
having
them
permanently
replaced?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
can't
bring
up
another
(inaudible),
why
should
we
bring
up
an
issue
assuming
they
had
been
replaced,
what
would
the
law
be?
unknown
speaker
why
do
we
do
give
that
issue
up
if
there
hasn't
been
a
finding
on
the
facts
that
they've
been
permanently
replaced?
unknown
speaker
well
--
unknown
speaker
well
did
the
employer
make
any
effort
to
prove
that
they
hadn't
been
permanently
replaced?
unknown
speaker
but
did
it
take
--
did
the
employer
take
the
position
if
they
had
been
permanently
replaced?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
wondering
on
the
absence
of
a
finding
if
there
had
been.
i
gather
it's
conceded
they
were
economic
strikers
from
the
beginning
--
at
the
beginning.
unknown
speaker
well
if
that's
so,
isn't
the
rule
on
mackay
that
--
then
at
the
time
of
application
they're
entitled
to
their
jobs
back
unless
they've
been
permanently
replaced.
is
it
the
employer's
burden
to
show
that
they
had
been
if
he
is
to
withstand
the
application
of
that
principle?
unknown
speaker
the
board
takes
the
attitude
and
makes
the
position
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
were
permanently
replaced
as
long
as
they
were
fired
beforehand.
you
don't
need
a
finding
of
that
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
is
this
an
argument
that
in
fact
this
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
in
part
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
that
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
cross
petition?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well
the
way
you
--
the
way
you
phrase
it
was
the
addition
of
the
question
presented
by
the
board,
respondent
--
respondent
respectfully
submits
the
following
additional
question.
unknown
speaker
but
as
mr.
justice
white
asked
really,
what
you
wanted
was
a
denial
of
enforcement
of
the
board's
order.
unknown
speaker
what
you
ended
up
with
was
a
remand
to
the
board
for
further
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
well
that's
just
it.
that's
why
i
wonder
whether
without
--
i
mean
maybe
it
sounds
rather
technical,
but
ordinarily
if
you
want
to
raise
an
issue
which
gives
you
a
different
judgment
then
you're
here
to
defend,
you
have
to
cross
petition,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
think
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
did
you
deliberately
choose
the
form
you
did
rather
than
cross
petition?
unknown
speaker
is
that
true
even
though
or
is
that
what
this
case
is
about
even

a
person
who
is
