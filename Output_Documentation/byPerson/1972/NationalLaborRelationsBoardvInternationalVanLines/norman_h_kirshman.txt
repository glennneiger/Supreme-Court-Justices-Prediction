mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
essence
of
the
case
before
you
and
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
very
simple.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
for
a
rule
of
evidence.
the
ninth
circuit
has
said,
“we
will
not
call
an
automatic
conversion
of
an
economic
striker
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
striker
without
substantial
evidence
that
the
unlawful
act
of
the
employer
has
prolonged
the
strike.”
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
34
of
our
brief
on
the
merits
holding
from
the
court.
the
court
points
out
in
the
middle
of
the
page
that
the
board
has
made
a
finding
--
the
board
has
argued
that
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
substantially
prolonged
the
strike
were
a
significant
factor
in
the
strike.
and
then
the
court
concludes
by
saying
the
board
adduces
no
evidence
in
support
of
this
necessary
effect.
we
submit
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
no
more
and
no
less
than
say
that
it
will
not
accept
a
per
se
conversion.
because
the
essence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
striker
is
an
individual
who
is
on
strike
protesting
the
unfair
labor
practice.
it's
a
question
of
cause
and
effect.
and
cause
and
effect
must
necessarily
require
evidence.
now
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
alone
with
all
due
respect
to
the
general
counsel,
the
ninth
circuit
is
in
the
company
of
the
second
circuit,
and
the
third
circuit,
and
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
thompson
case
and
the
frick
case,
and
in
the
jackson
printing.
each
case
the
circuits
recognized
the
cause
and
effect
situation
and
required
evidence.
i
think
that
the
board
has
the
burden
if
it
is
intending
to
impose
a
severe
restriction
of
unconditional
reinstatement.
approving
that
the
conduct
of
the
employer
prolonged
the
strike
and
the
court
below
merely
said
that
the
economic
strikers
were
on
strike
for
a
prior
complaint
that
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
strike
at
the
time
they
went
on
strike.
and
that
the
employer's
conduct
though
unlawful
may
or
may
not
have
had
a
bearing
under
a
continued
picket
line
conduct.
and
i
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
with
the
exception
of
the
december
12
request
for
reinstatement
all
other
request
as
late
as
april,
a
few
days
before
the
hearing
in
the
case
were
predicated
and
conditioned
upon
the
signing
by
the
employer
of
a
contract,
and
not
any
contract
but
a
specific
contract.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
the
finding
of
the
board
was
unclear
on
that
issue,
sir.
and
that
--
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
remanded.
the
court
said
that
they
were
not
--
no,
may
i
correct
myself.
the
court
said
they
were
not
permanently
replaced
at
the
time
of
the
unlawful
discharge.
but
the
court
said
that
the
record
was
unclear
as
to
whether
they
were
permanently
replaced
before
they
applied
for
reinstatement.
and
that
was
one
of
the
issues
upon
which
the
board
--
which
the
court
remanded
to
the
board
for
further
proceedings
to
determine
whether
there
was
substantial
business
justifications.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
there
were
temporary
replacements
hired.
he
cannot
legally
refuse
to
reinstatement
if
they
have
not
been
permanently
replaced.
but
the
court
did
not
find
and
the
board
did
not
make
it
clear
as
to
what
the
situation
was
when
the
employees
applied
for
reinstatement.
there
was
the
two
issues,
one
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
if
they
were
economic
strikers,
they
were
only
entitled
to
reinstatement
if
they
had
not
been
permanently
replaced.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that's
--
so
far
it's
true.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
because
the
record
was
not
clear
that
at
the
time
they
applied
for
reinstatement
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
assuming
they
had
been
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
the
court
remanded
it
on
that
issue,
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
at
--
at
the
time
they
applied
for
reinstatement,
the
court
held
that
when
they
were
discharged,
they
had
not
been
replaced.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
the
employer
put
in
payroll
record
showing
that
certain
employees
were
on
the
payroll.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
i
cannot
answer
that
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
lack
of
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
well,
we
submit
that
the
employer
does
not
--
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
had
not
been
permanently
replaced,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that
they
have
been
permanently
replaced.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that's
exactly
the
picture
that
the
board
certainly
had
before
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that's
the
position
of
the
board
your
honor.
and
the
position
of
the
board
is
that
that
result
occurs
regardless
of
the
evidence.
whether
or
not
there
is
any
evidence.
and
as
i
said,
we
submit
that
the
second,
third
and
seventh
circuits
provide
for
a
more
rational
view
of
the
case.
i
would
like
to
proceed
at
this
point
to
an
issue
that
may
or
may
be
before
the
court
but
respondent
has
included
it
in
it's
brief
and
in
the
answer
of
which
we
feel
was
in
the
nature
of
a
cross
petition.
and
that
question
is
fairly
comprised
within
the
question
of
reinstatement
and
threshold
to
it.
before
you
can
reach
the
question
of
reinstatement,
we
must
have
a
finding
of
unlawful
conduct
in
the
first
place.
and
we
believe
that
in
our
supplemental
brief
which
was
filed
with
the
court
that
the
90-day
period
has
not
run
from
a
jurisdictional
standpoint
and
that
the
court
may
consider
this
issue
if
it
feels
that
the
issue
is
worthy
of
consideration.
as
we
have
discussed,
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
not
a
final
decree.
the
employer
was
under
no
obligation
to
do
anything
at
that
point.
the
case
was
sent
to
the
board
for
the
taking
of
further
evidence.
therefore,
we
feel
that
there
was
no
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
the
90-day
period
in
respect
to
a
petition
for
a
certiorari.
the
issue
that
we
would
like
to
address
ourselves
to
is
whether
a
strike
to
force
the
employer
to
consent
to
an
election
in
effect
to
force
the
employer
to
forego
his
access
to
the
board
is
protected
activity.
and
we've
set
out
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
and
the
actual
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
and
we
conclude
with
all
humility
that
the
employer
has
an
absolute
right
to
his
hearing
in
a
representation
case.
this
is
a
statutory
right.
there
was
a
disagreement
in
the
congress
in
1947
as
to
whether
there
should
be
provisions
for
pre-election
--
for
pre-hearing
elections
and
the
majority
and
the
congress
determined
that
the
hearing
was
important
enough
so
that
it
would
set
forth
in
mandatory
terms.
the
access
to
the
board
for
the
hearing
is
critical.
it
provides,
one,
a
question
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
in
the
first
instance,
the
appropriateness
of
the
bargaining
unit
eligibility
to
vote
in
collateral
issues,
a
strike
to
force
the
employee
to
forego
this
hearing
we
submit
is
a
strike
in
derogation
of
the
orderly
process
of
the
board.
it's
an
invitation
to
a
labor
union
to
stand
up
and
say,
“well,
we
will
strike
unless
you
forego
your
right
to
have
the
regional
director
and
the
board
determine
whether
this
election
should
be
held
in
the
first
place.
and
if
it
is
held,
who
should
vote?”
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
in
the
interest
of
the
national
labor
policy.
we
don't
believe
it's
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
boy's
markets
case.
we
don't
believe
it's
consistent
with
those
cases
that
indicate
that
arbitration
is
preferable
to
a
strike
or
a
muscle-to-muscle
confrontation.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
we
believe
further
that
to
compound
this
problem,
this
particular
strike
had
a
dual
facet.
the
board
found
ultimately
that
it
was
a
strike
to
force
the
consent
and
also
could
have
been
a
strike
for
recognition.
i
already
covered
the
question
of
a
strike
to
force
a
consent.
in
respect
to
a
strike
to
force
an
immediate
recognition,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
failure
by
the
union
to
notify
the
employer
in
any
manner
other
than
by
receipt
from
the
employer
--
by
the
employer
from
the
board
of
the
petition
itself
and
the
failure
by
the
union
to
comply
with
the
boards
regulations
in
section
(9)
(c)
(4)
of
the
act
which
requires
an
allegation
in
the
petition
of
a
demand
for
recognition
and
a
refusal,
that
this
basic
jurisdictional
defect
in
that
petition
rendered
the
petition
a
nullity.
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
the
union's
activity
here
in
fabricating
and
this
is
a
finding
by
the
trial
examiner
which
was
not
disturbed
by
the
board
or
the
court.
that
the
union
have
fabricated
a
labor
dispute,
willfully
fabricated
a
dispute
on
a
non-existent
grievance
that
in
the
context
of
that
fabrication,
the
failure
to
allege
in
the
petition
that
there
was
a
demand
--
that
there
was
a
refusal
renders
that
petition
fatally
defective.
and
the
picketing
which
continued
for
more
than
30
days
was
such
a
fatally
defective
petition.
and
our
opinion
rendered
that
strike
a
violation
of
section
(8)
(b)
(7)
of
the
act.
and
the
authorities
are
quite
clear
that
an
employer
has
no
obligation
to
reinstate
any
striker
who
strikes
in
violation
of
(8)
(b)
(7)
of
the
act.
i
think
that
we
have
a
basic
question
before
the
court
on
the
consent
and/or
recognition
issues.
and
that
question
is,
“do
the
processes
of
the
board
prevail?
are
they
available
to
the
employer
in
the
same
fashion
that
they
are
available
to
the
employees?”
is
the
mandatory
language
of
congress
and
congress
didn't
say
it
may,
it
said
shout.
is
the
language
of
the
implementing
regulations
which
says
that
upon
the
filing
of
a
petition
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
board,
are
they
not
setup
as
a
condition
proceeding
to
the
processing
of
a
valid
petition?
or
on
the
alternative,
do
we
say
that
the
right
to
strike
is
so
powerful,
is
so
important
and
we
do
not
undermine
that
right?
it
is
powerful.
it
is
important.
but
where
is
the
balance?
do
we
invite
labor
to
ignore
the
board,
not
on
peripheral
issues
where
on
a
basic
due
process
--
due
process
issue,
the
question
of
the
employer's
right
to
a
hearing,
i
submit
that
that
is
what
the
court
is
faced
with
on
the
underlying
threshold
issues
which
in
respondent's
view
are
far
more
significant,
are
far
more
important
than
the
rule
of
evidence
which
has
been
promulgated
by
the
court
below.
we
can
live
with
a
rule
of
evidence.
a
rule
of
evidence
can
be
interpreted
very
strictly
by
the
board.
they
give
the
board
clearly
said
in
this
case
that
the
company
failed
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proof
if
it
has
such
a
burden
that
the
unfair
labor
practices
did
not
prolong
the
strike,
i
might
be
able
to
accept
that
as
a
lawyer,
but
the
board
didn't
say
that.
the
board
urges
an
automatic
per
se
conversion
theory.
notwithstanding
the
evidence,
notwithstanding
whether
the
unfair
labor
practice
occurs
one
day
before
the
strike,
six
months
before
the
strike,
six
months
after
the
strike.
a
per
se
rule
and
i
believe
in
the
law,
especially
in
the
law
of
labor
relations,
per
se
rules
are
very
dangerous.
much
in
the
practice
of
labor
law
and
much
in
our
functioning
here
in
labor
relations
is
not
so
much
what
the
employer
does.
it's
how
he
says
what
he
does.
and
for
example,
if
an
employer
says,
“i
am
going
to
discharge
you.”
or,
“i'm
going
to
replace
you.”
there
are
many
--
there
are
entirely
different
connotations
that
the
board
could
place
upon
this
semantical
difference.
basically,
these
are
our
three
issues,
the
consent
--
a
strike
to
force
a
consent
is
not
protected
activity,
and
the
case
decided
by
the
board
do
not
support
that
properly.
(inaudible)
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
washington
aluminum
which
is
cited
by
the
board
as
this
court‘s
authority
for
the
fact
of
a
strike
for
immediate
recognition
or
any
protest
without
notice
is
still
protected
activity.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
fact
that
in
washington
aluminum,
there
was
no
labor
union.
the
employees
were
not
represented
and
the
employees
had
instant
sit
down
strike
based
upon
working
conditions,
a
cold
shot.
that
is
a
far
cry
from
international
van
where
there
was
a
labor
union,
a
petition
filed
with
the
board,
and
a
fabricated
reason
for
the
strike.
i
submit
that
as
a
further
argument
for
the
unprotected
nature
of
these
activities
is
that
there
was
no
labor
dispute.
and
i'm
well
aware
of
the
mackay
language
which
talks
about
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
the
employee's
activities
in
going
on
strike.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
i
am
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
should
have
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
we
believe
we
did,
your
honor.
our
answer
was
in
the
nature
of
a
cross
petition
and
we
believe
that
it
was
timely
and
we
believe
that
there
is
such
plain
evidence
in
this
record.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
we
feel
it
quite
possibly,
your
honor
that
we
--
that
we
are
entitled
to
more
than
we
received
below
because
our
answer
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
i
think
we
do
sir,
with
all
due
respect.
our
answer
was
filed
raising
new
issues.
and
although
it
didn't
label
itself
as
a
cross
petition,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
we
attempted
to
raise
new
issues
if
we
are
not
jurisdictionally
untimely.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
(inaudible)
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
we
got
the
remand
on
the
--
on
the
issue
that
we
were
not
as
concerned
about.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
but
we
believe
that
the
doctrine
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
yes,
your
honor.
and
further,
your
honor,
we
believe
under
the
court's
rule
23
(1)
(c),
if
the
court
believes
that
the
issues
are
so
interrelated
that
you
can't
reach
a
question
of
damages
which
is
the
question
of
remedy
without
reaching
the
question
of
liability,
that
perhaps
the
court
in
its
discretion
could
take
it.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
no,
your
honor.
i
must
confess
this
is
my
first
trip
before
the
court
and
i
fumbled
somewhat.
i
--
i
would
like
to
comment
just
briefly
on
one
more
issue
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
labor
dispute
whether
or
not
there
was
a
labor
dispute.
i
believe
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
one
element
of
mackay
which
talks
about
the
mistaken
judgment
of
the
employees
or
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
going
on
strike
for
a
reason
which
is
not
correct
implies
good
faith.
i
think
when
you
--
when
you
examine
a
willful
fabrication
of
a
reason
to
go
on
strike,
the
element
of
a
good
faith
mistake
disappears
and
we
open
the
door
to
permitting
employees
or
a
union
--
or
a
union
representing
employees
to
fashion
a
labor
dispute
out
of
thin
air
anytime
they
want
to
bring
the
conduct
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
and
once
again,
i
believe
that
section
2
of
the
act
says
quite
clearly
or
at
least
implies
that
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
to
inquire
into
a
dispute
which
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
and
there
again
in
my
attempt
to
bootstrap,
i
would
believe
that
this
court
could
inquire
into
a
jurisdictional
error
even
if
not
raised
in
the
court
below.
but
we
did
raise
these
issues
at
trial.
they
were
commented
upon
by
the
trial
examiner,
and
i
believe
that
they
have
merit
and
should
be
considered
by
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
essence
of
the
case
before
you
and
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
very
simple.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
for
a
rule
of
evidence.
the
ninth
circuit
has
said,
“we
will
not
call
an
automatic
conversion
of
an
economic
striker
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
striker
without
substantial
evidence
that
the
unlawful
act
of
the
employer
has
prolonged
the
strike.”
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
34
of
our
brief
on
the
merits
holding
from
the
court.
the
court
points
out
in
the
middle
of
the
page
that
the
board
has
made
a
finding
--
the
board
has
argued
that
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
substantially
prolonged
the
strike
were
a
significant
factor
in
the
strike.
and
then
the
court
concludes
by
saying
the
board
adduces
no
evidence
in
support
of
this
necessary
effect.
we
submit
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
no
more
and
no
less
than
say
that
it
will
not
accept
a
per
se
conversion.
because
the
essence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
striker
is
an
individual
who
is
on
strike
protesting
the
unfair
labor
practice.
it's
a
question
of
cause
and
effect.
and
cause
and
effect
must
necessarily
require
evidence.
now
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
alone
with
all
due
respect
to
the
general
counsel,
the
ninth
circuit
is
in
the
company
of
the
second
circuit,
and
the
third
circuit,
and
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
thompson
case
and
the
frick
case,
and
in
the
jackson
printing.
each
case
the
circuits
recognized
the
cause
and
effect
situation
and
required
evidence.
i
think
that
the
board
has
the
burden
if
it
is
intending
to
impose
a
severe
restriction
of
unconditional
reinstatement.
approving
that
the
conduct
of
the
employer
prolonged
the
strike
and
the
court
below
merely
said
that
the
economic
strikers
were
on
strike
for
a
prior
complaint
that
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
strike
at
the
time
they
went
on
strike.
and
that
the
employer's
conduct
though
unlawful
may
or
may
not
have
had
a
bearing
under
a
continued
picket
line
conduct.
and
i
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
with
the
exception
of
the
december
12
request
for
reinstatement
all
other
request
as
late
as
april,
a
few
days
before
the
hearing
in
the
case
were
predicated
and
conditioned
upon
the
signing
by
the
employer
of
a
contract,
and
not
any
contract
but
a
specific
contract.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
the
finding
of
the
board
was
unclear
on
that
issue,
sir.
and
that
--
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
remanded.
the
court
said
that
they
were
not
--
no,
may
i
correct
myself.
the
court
said
they
were
not
permanently
replaced
at
the
time
of
the
unlawful
discharge.
but
the
court
said
that
the
record
was
unclear
as
to
whether
they
were
permanently
replaced
before
they
applied
for
reinstatement.
and
that
was
one
of
the
issues
upon
which
the
board
--
which
the
court
remanded
to
the
board
for
further
proceedings
to
determine
whether
there
was
substantial
business
justifications.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
there
were
temporary
replacements
hired.
he
cannot
legally
refuse
to
reinstatement
if
they
have
not
been
permanently
replaced.
but
the
court
did
not
find
and
the
board
did
not
make
it
clear
as
to
what
the
situation
was
when
the
employees
applied
for
reinstatement.
there
was
the
two
issues,
one
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
if
they
were
economic
strikers,
they
were
only
entitled
to
reinstatement
if
they
had
not
been
permanently
replaced.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that's
--
so
far
it's
true.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
because
the
record
was
not
clear
that
at
the
time
they
applied
for
reinstatement
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
assuming
they
had
been
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
the
court
remanded
it
on
that
issue,
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
at
--
at
the
time
they
applied
for
reinstatement,
the
court
held
that
when
they
were
discharged,
they
had
not
been
replaced.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
the
employer
put
in
payroll
record
showing
that
certain
employees
were
on
the
payroll.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
i
cannot
answer
that
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
lack
of
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
well,
we
submit
that
the
employer
does
not
--
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
had
not
been
permanently
replaced,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that
they
have
been
permanently
replaced.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that's
exactly
the
picture
that
the
board
certainly
had
before
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that's
the
position
of
the
board
your
honor.
and
the
position
of
the
board
is
that
that
result
occurs
regardless
of
the
evidence.
whether
or
not
there
is
any
evidence.
and
as
i
said,
we
submit
that
the
second,
third
and
seventh
circuits
provide
for
a
more
rational
view
of
the
case.
i
would
like
to
proceed
at
this
point
to
an
issue
that
may
or
may
be
before
the
court
but
respondent
has
included
it
in
it's
brief
and
in
the
answer
of
which
we
feel
was
in
the
nature
of
a
cross
petition.
and
that
question
is
fairly
comprised
within
the
question
of
reinstatement
and
threshold
to
it.
before
you
can
reach
the
question
of
reinstatement,
we
must
have
a
finding
of
unlawful
conduct
in
the
first
place.
and
we
believe
that
in
our
supplemental
brief
which
was
filed
with
the
court
that
the
90-day
period
has
not
run
from
a
jurisdictional
standpoint
and
that
the
court
may
consider
this
issue
if
it
feels
that
the
issue
is
worthy
of
consideration.
as
we
have
discussed,
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
not
a
final
decree.
the
employer
was
under
no
obligation
to
do
anything
at
that
point.
the
case
was
sent
to
the
board
for
the
taking
of
further
evidence.
therefore,
we
feel
that
there
was
no
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
the
90-day
period
in
respect
to
a
petition
for
a
certiorari.
the
issue
that
we
would
like
to
address
ourselves
to
is
whether
a
strike
to
force
the
employer
to
consent
to
an
election
in
effect
to
force
the
employer
to
forego
his
access
to
the
board
is
protected
activity.
and
we've
set
out
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
and
the
actual
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
and
we
conclude
with
all
humility
that
the
employer
has
an
absolute
right
to
his
hearing
in
a
representation
case.
this
is
a
statutory
right.
there
was
a
disagreement
in
the
congress
in
1947
as
to
whether
there
should
be
provisions
for
pre-election
--
for
pre-hearing
elections
and
the
majority
and
the
congress
determined
that
the
hearing
was
important
enough
so
that
it
would
set
forth
in
mandatory
terms.
the
access
to
the
board
for
the
hearing
is
critical.
it
provides,
one,
a
question
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
in
the
first
instance,
the
appropriateness
of
the
bargaining
unit
eligibility
to
vote
in
collateral
issues,
a
strike
to
force
the
employee
to
forego
this
hearing
we
submit
is
a
strike
in
derogation
of
the
orderly
process
of
the
board.
it's
an
invitation
to
a
labor
union
to
stand
up
and
say,
“well,
we
will
strike
unless
you
forego
your
right
to
have
the
regional
director
and
the
board
determine
whether
this
election
should
be
held
in
the
first
place.
and
if
it
is
held,
who
should
vote?”
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
in
the
interest
of
the
national
labor
policy.
we
don't
believe
it's
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
boy's
markets
case.
we
don't
believe
it's
consistent
with
those
cases
that
indicate
that
arbitration
is
preferable
to
a
strike
or
a
muscle-to-muscle
confrontation.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
we
believe
further
that
to
compound
this
problem,
this
particular
strike
had
a
dual
facet.
the
board
found
ultimately
that
it
was
a
strike
to
force
the
consent
and
also
could
have
been
a
strike
for
recognition.
i
already
covered
the
question
of
a
strike
to
force
a
consent.
in
respect
to
a
strike
to
force
an
immediate
recognition,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
failure
by
the
union
to
notify
the
employer
in
any
manner
other
than
by
receipt
from
the
employer
--
by
the
employer
from
the
board
of
the
petition
itself
and
the
failure
by
the
union
to
comply
with
the
boards
regulations
in
section
(9)
(c)
(4)
of
the
act
which
requires
an
allegation
in
the
petition
of
a
demand
for
recognition
and
a
refusal,
that
this
basic
jurisdictional
defect
in
that
petition
rendered
the
petition
a
nullity.
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
the
union's
activity
here
in
fabricating
and
this
is
a
finding
by
the
trial
examiner
which
was
not
disturbed
by
the
board
or
the
court.
that
the
union
have
fabricated
a
labor
dispute,
willfully
fabricated
a
dispute
on
a
non-existent
grievance
that
in
the
context
of
that
fabrication,
the
failure
to
allege
in
the
petition
that
there
was
a
demand
--
that
there
was
a
refusal
renders
that
petition
fatally
defective.
and
the
picketing
which
continued
for
more
than
30
days
was
such
a
fatally
defective
petition.
and
our
opinion
rendered
that
strike
a
violation
of
section
(8)
(b)
(7)
of
the
act.
and
the
authorities
are
quite
clear
that
an
employer
has
no
obligation
to
reinstate
any
striker
who
strikes
in
violation
of
(8)
(b)
(7)
of
the
act.
i
think
that
we
have
a
basic
question
before
the
court
on
the
consent
and/or
recognition
issues.
and
that
question
is,
“do
the
processes
of
the
board
prevail?
are
they
available
to
the
employer
in
the
same
fashion
that
they
are
available
to
the
employees?”
is
the
mandatory
language
of
congress
and
congress
didn't
say
it
may,
it
said
shout.
is
the
language
of
the
implementing
regulations
which
says
that
upon
the
filing
of
a
petition
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
by
the
board,
are
they
not
setup
as
a
condition
proceeding
to
the
processing
of
a
valid
petition?
or
on
the
alternative,
do
we
say
that
the
right
to
strike
is
so
powerful,
is
so
important
and
we
do
not
undermine
that
right?
it
is
powerful.
it
is
important.
but
where
is
the
balance?
do
we
invite
labor
to
ignore
the
board,
not
on
peripheral
issues
where
on
a
basic
due
process
--
due
process
issue,
the
question
of
the
employer's
right
to
a
hearing,
i
submit
that
that
is
what
the
court
is
faced
with
on
the
underlying
threshold
issues
which
in
respondent's
view
are
far
more
significant,
are
far
more
important
than
the
rule
of
evidence
which
has
been
promulgated
by
the
court
below.
we
can
live
with
a
rule
of
evidence.
a
rule
of
evidence
can
be
interpreted
very
strictly
by
the
board.
they
give
the
board
clearly
said
in
this
case
that
the
company
failed
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proof
if
it
has
such
a
burden
that
the
unfair
labor
practices
did
not
prolong
the
strike,
i
might
be
able
to
accept
that
as
a
lawyer,
but
the
board
didn't
say
that.
the
board
urges
an
automatic
per
se
conversion
theory.
notwithstanding
the
evidence,
notwithstanding
whether
the
unfair
labor
practice
occurs
one
day
before
the
strike,
six
months
before
the
strike,
six
months
after
the
strike.
a
per
se
rule
and
i
believe
in
the
law,
especially
in
the
law
of
labor
relations,
per
se
rules
are
very
dangerous.
much
in
the
practice
of
labor
law
and
much
in
our
functioning
here
in
labor
relations
is
not
so
much
what
the
employer
does.
it's
how
he
says
what
he
does.
and
for
example,
if
an
employer
says,
“i
am
going
to
discharge
you.”
or,
“i'm
going
to
replace
you.”
there
are
many
--
there
are
entirely
different
connotations
that
the
board
could
place
upon
this
semantical
difference.
basically,
these
are
our
three
issues,
the
consent
--
a
strike
to
force
a
consent
is
not
protected
activity,
and
the
case
decided
by
the
board
do
not
support
that
properly.
(inaudible)
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
washington
aluminum
which
is
cited
by
the
board
as
this
court‘s
authority
for
the
fact
of
a
strike
for
immediate
recognition
or
any
protest
without
notice
is
still
protected
activity.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
fact
that
in
washington
aluminum,
there
was
no
labor
union.
the
employees
were
not
represented
and
the
employees
had
instant
sit
down
strike
based
upon
working
conditions,
a
cold
shot.
that
is
a
far
cry
from
international
van
where
there
was
a
labor
union,
a
petition
filed
with
the
board,
and
a
fabricated
reason
for
the
strike.
i
submit
that
as
a
further
argument
for
the
unprotected
nature
of
these
activities
is
that
there
was
no
labor
dispute.
and
i'm
well
aware
of
the
mackay
language
which
talks
about
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
the
employee's
activities
in
going
on
strike.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
i
am
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
should
have
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
we
believe
we
did,
your
honor.
our
answer
was
in
the
nature
of
a
cross
petition
and
we
believe
that
it
was
timely
and
we
believe
that
there
is
such
plain
evidence
in
this
record.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
we
feel
it
quite
possibly,
your
honor
that
we
--
that
we
are
entitled
to
more
than
we
received
below
because
our
answer
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
i
think
we
do
sir,
with
all
due
respect.
our
answer
was
filed
raising
new
issues.
and
although
it
didn't
label
itself
as
a
cross
petition,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
we
attempted
to
raise
new
issues
if
we
are
not
jurisdictionally
untimely.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
(inaudible)
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
we
got
the
remand
on
the
--
on
the
issue
that
we
were
not
as
concerned
about.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
but
we
believe
that
the
doctrine
--
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
yes,
your
honor.
and
further,
your
honor,
we
believe
under
the
court's
rule
23
(1)
(c),
if
the
court
believes
that
the
issues
are
so
interrelated
that
you
can't
reach
a
question
of
damages
which
is
the
question
of
remedy
without
reaching
the
question
of
liability,
that
perhaps
the
court
in
its
discretion
could
take
it.
mr.
norman
h.
kirshman
no,
your
honor.
i
must
confess
this
is
my
first
trip
before
the
court
and
i
fumbled
somewhat.
i
--
i
would
like
to
comment
just
briefly
on
one
more
issue
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
labor
dispute
whether
or
not
there
was
a
labor
dispute.
i
believe
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
one
element
of
mackay
which
talks
about
the
mistaken
judgment
of
the
employees
or
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
going
on
strike
for
a
reason
which
is
not
correct
implies
good
faith.
i
think
when
you
--
when
you
examine
a
willful
fabrication
of
a
reason
to
go
on
strike,
the
element
of
a
good
faith
mistake
disappears
and
we
open
the
door
to
permitting
employees
or
a
union
--
or
a
union
representing
employees
to
fashion
a
labor
dispute
out
of
thin
air
anytime
they
want
to
bring
the
conduct
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
and
once
again,
i
believe
that
section
2
of
the
act
says
quite
clearly
or
at
least
implies
that
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
to
inquire
into
a
dispute
which
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
and
there
again
in
my
attempt
to
bootstrap,
i
would
believe
that
this
court
could
inquire
into
a
jurisdictional
error
even
if
not
raised
in
the
court
below.
but
we
did
raise
these
issues
at
trial.
they
were
commented
upon
by
the
trial
examiner,
and
i
believe
that
they
have
merit
and
should
be
considered
by
the
court.
thank
you.
