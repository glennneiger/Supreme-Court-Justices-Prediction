justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
any
allegations
as
to
why
it
wasn’t
waived?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
a
case
whether
it's
raised
that
--
that
it
wasn't
raised?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
in
a
habeas
corpus
petition
or
2255
petition,
we
should
make
some
--
if
it
--
then
you
should
make
some
allegations
that
i
didn’t
--
either
that
i
didn’t
know
or
even
if
i
knew
there
were
--
there
was
a
reason
for
not
raising
it,
so
that
you
can
create
some
--
for
having
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
all
was
alleged,
that
was
it
raised
and
the
court
determines
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
there's
no
real
issue
of
the
fact,
why
should
there
be
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
he
claimed
that
--
so
now
you
move
to
another
issue
and
says,
i
did
not
waive
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
don’t
you
suppose
that
he
should
say
that
why
he
didn’t
raise
it?
whose
burden
is
it
to
show
that
the
presence
or
lack
of
deliberate
language?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
it
is
2255
petition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn’t
even
allege
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did
not
claim
it.
he
didn’t
say
why,
(inaudible)
say
why
he
didn’t
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
take
it
then
you
are
saying,
either
are
you
in
any
position
or
willing
to
say
that
this
(inaudible)
if
he
didn’t
waive
it,
why
he
didn’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
what
if
it
--
assume
that
the
(inaudible)
represented
by
counsel
and
counsel
knew
what
the
rule
was
and
did
not
raise
it,
assume
that,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
say
automatically
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
to,
to
maintain
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
in
a
criminal
trial
or
a
civil
trial,
if
you
don’t
demand
a
jury
that
you
can
later
say,
i
didn't
intend
a
waiver
except
for
a
hearing,
even
though
you
know
perfectly
well
that
(inaudible)
given
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
if
the
rule
says
and
you
know
about
it,
but
if
you
don’t
make
the
demand
if
you
indeed
waive?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn’t
make
any
difference,
even
though
you
know
that
and
you
know
that
you
don’t
raise
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
view
the
issue
here
about
challenging
the
grand
jury
differently
from
the
issue
in
henry
against
mississippi
insofar
as
a
necessity
consultant
for
the
defendant
is
concerned?
do
you
think
a
lawyer
has
to
consult
the
defendant
about
everything
before
he
can
waive
it,
before
the
defendant
is
bound
by
the
lawyer’s
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
of
substantial
constitutional
issue
in
the
humphrey,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
the
court
say
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
what
--
didn’t
we
sent
it
back
to
see
if
they
knew
about
it,
knew
about
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
think
that
there
is
--
at
least
you
say
that
this
grand
jury
point
is
something
--
is
an
issue
they
must
consult
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
henry
was
after
noia.
i
mean,
if
noia
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
must
consult
about
everything,
that
rule
hasn’t
survived,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
constitutes
a
waiver,
and
what
constituted
a
waiver
in
henry?
what
might
constitute
a
waiver
in
henry,
knowledge
and
failure
to
object
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
wulf,
would
you
say
that
the
lawyer
and
client
consulted
and
they
both
agreed
that
well
we’d
rather
save
this
for
a
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
a
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
have
to
have
some
other
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
other
good
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
you
must
say
then
that
there
are
some
reasons
that,
that
will
be
--
it
will
excuse
not
raising
it
and
other
reasons
it
will,
will
not.
now
what
are
the
reasons,
for
example,
it
will
excuse
not
raising
it
if
you
know
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
give
me
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
now,
finally,
you're
going
to
say
what
their
excuse
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
should
allege
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
they
should
allege
that
in
a
habeas
corpus
petition
rather
than
burden
some
federal
court
with
having
a
hearing
in
every
case
just
to
find
out
what
the
reason
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
concede
there
are
some
reasons
that
are
no
good
and
other
reasons
that
are
fine,
don’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don’t
you
say
one
reason
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn’t
you
accept
then
an
immediate
ground,
you
dismiss
the
petition,
but
with
the
leave
to
refile,
saying
what
the
reason
is,
rather
than
having
to
hold
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
would
be
alright
to
view
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
said
we
affirm,
but
without
leave
--
without
prejudice
to
refiling,
stating
a
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
he
can
always
refile?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
--
what
would
you
say
if
there
was
an
allegation
in
this
case
that
are
the
other
reason
for
not
raising
the
matter
and
knowing
--
and
the
--
to
backup
this
claim
of
no
waiver.
let’s
assume
he
alleged
that
he
was
threatened
that
if
raised
it
he
would
be
charged
with
something
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
a
good
reason
in
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
what
about
a
reason
that
it
would
annoy
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
about
the
state
cases
in
ca
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
made
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
objection
is
made
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
--
there
should
have
been
a
hearing
in
this
case
if
he
had
made
an
allegation
of
a
sufficient
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
contradicted.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

justice
byron

white
would
you
make

he
didn’t

say
why
he

justice

now,
i
take
