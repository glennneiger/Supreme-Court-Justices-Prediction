mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
not
as
the
petitioner
alleges
in
his
reply
brief
whether
the
right
to
grand
jury
indictment,
whether
this
court
should
assign
the
prohibition
against
racial
discrimination
in
grand
jury
selection
to
the
dustbin.
the
issue
rather
is
whether
that
right
should
be
vindicated
in
the
orderly
procedure
promulgated
by
this
court
in
rule
12
(b)
(2)
and
adopted
by
congress,
and
that
procedure
is
simply
that
the
motion
which
does
not
go
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
which
does
not
go
to
the
admissibility
of
any
evidence
at
the
trial,
which
does
not
go
to
the
defendant’s
guilt
or
innocence,
but
to
a
defect
in
the
pretrial
proceedings
which
can
easily
be
cured
if
timely
raised,
whether
such
emotion
should
be
raised
prior
to
trial
or
years
later
after
trial
and
conviction,
when
retrial
may
be
difficult
or
impossible
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
now,
i’d
like
to
talk
about
rule
12
(b)
(2)
for
a
while
rather
than
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
because
rule
12
(b)
(2)
is
not
simply
a
procedure
for
making
a
motion
prior
to
trial.
rule
12
(b)
(2)
under
the
enabling
act
is
the
equivalent
of
a
specific
federal
statute.
under
the
terms
of
the
enabling
act,
rule
12
(b)
(2)
operates
and
in
fact,
to
repeal
any
statute
which
is
inconsistent
with
its
provisions,
and
rule
12
(b)
(2)
does
not
talk
about
knowing
deliberate
waivers.
it
does
not
talk
about
waivers
that
are
made
only
with
consultations
by
the
defendant’s
lawyer,
with
his
client.
rule
12
(b)
(2)
says
in
plain
terms
that
if
you
don’t
make
this
motion,
it
shall
be
deemed
waived.
this
is
really
not
a
waiver
in
the
general
sense
of
the
term,
but
really
the
equivalent
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
just
as
one's
right
to
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
waived
unless
you
have
a
knowing
and
deliberate
waiver,
that
does
not
operate
to
make
a
statute
of
limitations
which
says
you
can
only
raise
this
claim
for
just
compensation
in
three
years
or
four
years,
unconstitutional.
rule
12
(b)
(2)
has
the
same
affect
as
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations
for
the
assertion
of
a
particular
constitutional
right.
and
the
policy
considerations
which
motivated
the
adoption
of
rule
12(b)
are
rather
plain.
there
really
is
no
incentive
for
a
lawyer
representing
a
defendant
to
make
this
kind
of
a
motion
before
trial,
because
what
does
he
get?
what
would
mr.
davis’
lawyer
would
have
gotten
for
him
had
he
made
this
motion
prior
to
trial
and
had
he
been
successful?
he
would
have
gotten
from
mr.
davis
a
new
indictment.
mr.
davis
would
have
stood
trial,
and
by
the
way,
it’s
worth
noting
here
that
the
defendant
was
caught
in
the
act.
there
isn’t
a
slightest
question
that
any
grand
juror,
black
or
white,
faithful
to
himself
would
have
voted
this
indictment.
so
he
would
have
gotten
simply
a
new
indictment,
and
that’s
true
with
many
defects
in
the
institution
of
the
proceedings.
they
are
easily
cured
if
you
make
the
motion
when
you're
supposed
to
make
them.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
great
incentive
to
sit
back,
say,
why
should
i
bother
making
this
motion
now,
let
me
take
my
chances
on
an
acquittal.
and
if
he’s
found
guilty,
well,
then
i
can
go
ahead
and
make
the
motion
after
trial
and
that’s
just
another
way
of
upsetting
a
valid
judgment
of
conviction.
now,
the
statute
despite
the
fact
of
rule
12
(b)
(2)
thus
has
a
reasonable
justification.
it
is
not
an
absolute
waiver
provision.
it
has
an
expressed
clause
that
gives
the
judge
the
right
to
grant
relief
from
the
provisions
of
the
waiver,
from
the
waiver
clause
upon
a
showing
of
just
cause.
no
showing
of
just
cause
was
made
here,
and
that
both
courts
below
so
found.
there
was
not
a
slightest
doubt
that
this
defect
about
which
the
petitioner
complains
could
have
been
made
and
discovered
with
due
diligence
at
the
time.
and
so
that
we
have
here
a
rule
which
is
the
equivalent
of
a
federal
statute
and
which
takes
precedence
over
anything
to
the
contrary
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
having
said
that,
let
me
say
one
more
thing,
that
at
the
time
rule
12
(b)
(2)
was
adopted,
there
was
no
conflict
between
rule
12
(b)
(2)
and
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
in
1946.
it
was
well
understood
and
it's
settled
law
that
if
you
didn’t
comply
with
the
procedural
rule
to
raise
an
objection
timely.
when
you
should
have,
you
could
not
get
federal
habeas
corpus
relief,
and
as
a
matter,
this
court
so
held
in
daniels
versus
allen
decided
in
1952
after
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
now
any
inconsistency
between
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
and
the
provisions
of
rule
12
(b)
(2),
it’s
resulted
because
of
a
thorough
reexamination
of
the
language
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
undertaken
in
fay
versus
noia.
no
--
there
is
no
similar
basis
for
reinterpretation
of
rule
12
(b)
that
the
defendant
asks
for
here.
rule
12
(b),
both
the
language
of
rule
12
(b),
the
advisory
committee
notes,
the
notes
of
the
preliminary
draftsmen
all
indicate,
(a)
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
here,
and
(b)
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there
was
knowing
and
deliberate
waiver.
now,
there
are
cases,
state
cases
which
are
cited
and
mr.
wulf
has
alluded
to
them
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
granted
habeas
corpus
relief
to
state
prisoners.
now,
there
are
two
things
that
i’d
like
to
say
about
those
cases.
first,
any
state
procedural
rule
which
is
the
equivalent
of
rule
12
(b)
and
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
habeas
corpus
statute
would
under
the
supremacy
clause
have
to
yield
to
those
provisions.
as
the
court
noted
in
fay
versus
noia,
state
procedural
rules
must
yield
to
the
strong
policy
considerations
which
are
reflected
by
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
in
this
case,
as
far
as
this
federal
prisoner
is
concerned,
the
federal
policy
as
stated
by
rule
12
(b)
(2),
that
was
promulgated
by
this
court,
that
was
adopted
by
congress
that
it
need
not
yield
to
the
contrary
under
18
u.s.c.
3771,
it’s
the
habeas
corpus
statute
which
must
yield.
in
the
second
place,
it
wasn’t
until
last
year
in
the
case
of
which
will
be
heard
right
after
this
one,
that
any
federal
court
held
that
where
the
sole
claim
was
to
the
grand
jury
and
not
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury
that
this
claim
could
be
raised
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
parker
versus
north
carolina
reported
at
397
u.s.,
decided
long
after
fay
and
after
kaufman,
mr.
justice
white
stated
for
the
court
that
the
issue,
whether
the
failure
to
comply
with
a
procedural
rule
similar
to
rule
12
(b)
wasn’t
--
could
--
would
stand
as
a
bar
to
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
was
still
an
open
question.
now,
there
are
many
reasons
why
that
should
stand
as
an
open
question.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
under
rule
12
(b)
the
judge
has
wide
discretion
to
grant
relief
from
the
waiver
provisions,
and
if
he
gave
--
if
he
came
up
with
the
reason
that
moved
the
court
to
exercise
this
discretion.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
the
reason
that
your
honor
suggested.
i
think
another
reason
might
be
the
failure
--
the
inability
to
have
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
wouldn’t
think
that,
that
was
an
adequate
reason.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
as
i’ve
indicated,
all
of
the
state
cases
until
the
most
recent
one,
in
winters
versus
cook,
all
involved
claims
with
respect
to
both
the
grand
and
petit
jury.
i’m
willing
to
concede
for
these
purposes
that
there
is
a
--
that
the
claim
of
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury.
now
the
petit
jury
as
opposed
to
the
grand
jury
involves
different
considerations
that
are
based
on
the
difference
of
the
role
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
of
criminal
justice.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
right
is
simply
more
significant
and
therefore
before
waiver
is
implied
perhaps
there
might
be
a
greater
showing
or
less
of
a
requirement
that
ought
to
be
made
in
terms
of
explaining
a
waiver
than
in
cases
of
grand
juries.
i’m
not
conceding
and
i
merely
suggest
that
the
two
cases
are
not
necessarily
the
same.
there
are
lots
of
times
during
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
if
it
were
sufficient
on
its
face
and
it
was
not
contradicted,
i
would
assume
that,
that
perhaps
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
if
it
was
contradicted.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
now,
there
is
the
same
strong
policy
considerations
which
we
submit
motivated
and
justify
rule
12
(b)
would
also
and
should
also
justify
this
court,
that
a
district
court
denying
habeas
corpus
relief
even
if
there
were
no
rule
12
(b).
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
involved
claims
with
respect
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
for
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
and
to
claims
which
go
ultimately
to
whether
the
person
should
be
found
guilty
or
not
guilty.
the
claim
with
respect
to
a
grand
jury
stands
on
a
much,
much
different
level.
it
does
not
involve
any
of
those
claims
at
all.
it
involves
simply
the
issue
of
whether
this
man
should
be
indicted
on
the
basis
of
a
particular
set
of
facts.
while
the
right
to
a
grand
jury
of
course
is
a
significant
important
right,
this
court
has
recognized
the
distinction
on
several
occasions,
that
is
the
distinction
between
the
petit
jury
and
the
grand
jury.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
refused
to
hold
that
the
right
to
a
grand
jury
is
so
fundamental
that
the
states
must
provide
it
under
the
due
process
clause.
in
costello
versus
the
united
states,
the
issue
was
whether
a
defendant
could
obtain
a
review
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
evidence,
any
legally
sufficient
evidence
at
all
to
sustain
the
indictment,
and
this
court,
in
an
unanimous
opinions
said
no.
and
mr.
justice
black
writing
for
the
court
said,
that
in
a
trial
on
the
merits,
defendants
are
entitled
to
a
strict
observance
of
all
the
rules
designed
to
bring
about
a
fair
verdict.
defendants
are
not
entitled
however
to
a
rule
which
would
result
in
interminable
delay
but
add
nothing
to
the
assurance
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
the
right
to
a
grand
jury
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
and
to
permit
it
to
be
asserted
years
after
a
judgment
of
conviction,
when
retrial
may
be
difficult
or
impossible,
would
have
an
undesirable
effect
on
the
entire
criminal
justice
system
as
it's
come
to
be
recognized
that
the
notion
that
there
must
come
a
time
when
judgments
of
conviction
become
final,
when
they
are
no
longer
subject,
when
issues
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence
or
with
the
fairness
of
the
trial
cannot
be
rehashed
over
and
over
again
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case
the
courts
properly
ruled
that
the
claim
was
barred
by
rule
12
(b)
(2)
and
they
properly
denied
habeas
corpus
relief.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
not
as
the
petitioner
alleges
in
his
reply
brief
whether
the
right
to
grand
jury
indictment,
whether
this
court
should
assign
the
prohibition
against
racial
discrimination
in
grand
jury
selection
to
the
dustbin.
the
issue
rather
is
whether
that
right
should
be
vindicated
in
the
orderly
procedure
promulgated
by
this
court
in
rule
12
(b)
(2)
and
adopted
by
congress,
and
that
procedure
is
simply
that
the
motion
which
does
not
go
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
which
does
not
go
to
the
admissibility
of
any
evidence
at
the
trial,
which
does
not
go
to
the
defendant’s
guilt
or
innocence,
but
to
a
defect
in
the
pretrial
proceedings
which
can
easily
be
cured
if
timely
raised,
whether
such
emotion
should
be
raised
prior
to
trial
or
years
later
after
trial
and
conviction,
when
retrial
may
be
difficult
or
impossible
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
now,
i’d
like
to
talk
about
rule
12
(b)
(2)
for
a
while
rather
than
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
because

(2)
thus
has
a
reasonable
justification.
it
is
not
an
absolute
waiver
provision.
it
has
an
expressed
clause
that
gives
the
judge
the
right
to
grant
relief
from
the
provisions
of
the
waiver,
from
the
waiver
clause
upon
a
showing
of
just
cause.
no
showing
of
just
cause
was
made
here,
and
that
both
courts
below
so
found.
there
was
not
a
slightest
doubt
that
this
defect
about
which
the
petitioner
complains
could
have
been
made
and
discovered
with
due
diligence
at
the
time.
and
so
that
we
have
here
a
rule
which
is
the
equivalent
of
a
federal
statute
and
which
takes
precedence
over
anything
to
the
contrary
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
having
said
that,
let
me
say
one
more
thing,
that
at
the
time
rule
12
(b)
(2)
was
adopted,
there
was
no
conflict
between
rule
12
(b)
(2)
and
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
in
1946.
it
was
well
understood
and
it's
settled
law
that
if
you
didn’t
comply
with
the
procedural
rule
to
raise
an
objection
timely.
when
you
should
have,
you
could
not
get
federal
habeas
corpus
relief,
and
as
a
matter,
this
court
so
held
in
daniels
versus
allen
decided
in
1952
after
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
now
any
inconsistency
between
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
and
the
provisions
of
rule
12
(b)
(2),
it’s
resulted
because
of
a
thorough
reexamination
of
the
language
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
undertaken
in
fay
versus
noia.
no
--
there
is
no
similar
basis
for
reinterpretation
of
rule
12
(b)
that
the
defendant
asks
for
here.
rule
12
(b),
both
the
language
of
rule
12
(b),
the
advisory
committee
notes,
the
notes
of
the
preliminary
draftsmen
all
indicate,
(a)
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
here,
and
(b)
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there
was
knowing
and
deliberate
waiver.
now,
there
are
cases,
state
cases
which
are
cited
and
mr.
wulf
has
alluded
to
them
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
granted
habeas
corpus
relief
to
state
prisoners.
now,
there
are
two
things
that
i’d
like
to
say
about
those
cases.
first,
any
state
procedural
rule
which
is
the
equivalent
of
rule
12
(b)
and
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
habeas
corpus
statute
would
under
the
supremacy
clause
have
to
yield
to
those
provisions.
as
the
court
noted
in
fay
versus
noia,
state
procedural
rules
must
yield
to
the
strong
policy
considerations
which
are
reflected
by
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
in
this
case,
as
far
as
this
federal
prisoner
is
concerned,
the
federal
policy
as
stated
by
rule
12
(b)
(2),
that
was
promulgated
by
this
court,
that
was
adopted
by
congress
that
it
need
not
yield
to
the
contrary
under
18
u.s.c.
3771,
it’s
the
habeas
corpus
statute
which
must
yield.
in
the
second
place,
it
wasn’t
until
last
year
in
the
case
of
which
will
be
heard
right
after
this
one,
that
any
federal
court
held
that
where
the
sole
claim
was
to
the
grand
jury
and
not
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury
that
this
claim
could
be
raised
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
parker
versus
north
carolina
reported
at
397
u.s.,
decided
long
after
fay
and
after
kaufman,
mr.
justice
white
stated
for
the
court
that
the
issue,
whether
the
failure
to
comply
with
a
procedural
rule
similar
to
rule
12
(b)
wasn’t
--
could
--
would
stand
as
a
bar
to
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
was
still
an
open
question.
now,
there
are
many
reasons
why
that
should
stand
as
an
open
question.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
under
rule
12
(b)
the
judge
has
wide
discretion
to
grant
relief
from
the
waiver
provisions,
and
if
he
gave
--
if
he
came
up
with
the
reason
that
moved
the
court
to
exercise
this
discretion.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
the
reason
that
your
honor
suggested.
i
think
another
reason
might
be
the
failure
--
the
inability
to
have
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
wouldn’t
think
that,
that
was
an
adequate
reason.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
as
i’ve
indicated,
all
of
the
state
cases
until
the
most
recent
one,
in
winters
versus
cook,
all
involved
claims
with
respect
to
both
the
grand
and
petit
jury.
i’m
willing
to
concede
for
these
purposes
that
there
is
a
--
that
the
claim
of
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury.
now
the
petit
jury
as
opposed
to
the
grand
jury
involves
different
considerations
that
are
based
on
the
difference
of
the
role
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
of
criminal
justice.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
right
is
simply
more
significant
and
therefore
before
waiver
is
implied
perhaps
there
might
be
a
greater
showing
or
less
of
a
requirement
that
ought
to
be
made
in
terms
of
explaining
a
waiver
than
in
cases
of
grand
juries.
i’m
not
conceding
and
i
merely
suggest
that
the
two
cases
are
not
necessarily
the
same.
there
are
lots
of
times
during
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
if
it
were
sufficient
on
its
face
and
it
was
not
contradicted,
i
would
assume
that,
that
perhaps
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
if
it
was
contradicted.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
now,
there
is
the
same
strong
policy
considerations
which
we
submit
motivated
and
justify
rule
12
(b)
would
also
and
should
also
justify
this
court,
that
a
district
court
denying
habeas
corpus
relief
even
if
there
were
no
rule
12
(b).
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
involved
claims
with
respect
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
for
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
and
to
claims
which
go
ultimately
to
whether
the
person
should
be
found
guilty
or
not
guilty.
the
claim
with
respect
to
a
grand
jury
stands
on
a
much,
much
different
level.
it
does
not
involve
any
of
those
claims
at
all.
it
involves
simply
the
issue
of
whether
this
man
should
be
indicted
on
the
basis
of
a
particular
set
of
facts.
while
the
right
to
a
grand
jury
of
course
is
a
significant
important
right,
this
court
has
recognized
the
distinction
on
several
occasions,
that
is
the
distinction
between
the
petit
jury
and
the
grand
jury.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
refused
to
hold
that
the
right
to
a
grand
jury
is
so
fundamental
that
the
states
must
provide
it
under
the
due
process
clause.
in
costello
versus
the
united
states,
the
issue
was
whether
a
defendant
could
obtain
a
review
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
evidence,
any
legally
sufficient
evidence
at
all
to
sustain
the
indictment,
and
this
court,
in
an
unanimous
opinions
said
no.
and
mr.
justice
black
writing
for
the
court
said,
that
in
a
trial
on
the
merits,
defendants
are
entitled
to
a
strict
observance
of
all
the
rules
designed
to
bring
about
a
fair
verdict.
defendants
are
not
entitled
however
to
a
rule
which
would
result
in
interminable
delay
but
add
nothing
to
the
assurance
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
the
right
to
a
grand
jury
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
and
to
permit
it
to
be
asserted
years
after
a
judgment
of
conviction,
when
retrial
may
be
difficult
or
impossible,
would
have
an
undesirable
effect
on
the
entire
criminal
justice
system
as
it's
come
to
be
recognized
that
the
notion
that
there
must
come
a
time
when
judgments
of
conviction
become
final,
when
they
are
no
longer
subject,
when
issues
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence
or
with
the
fairness
of
the
trial
cannot
be
rehashed
over
and
over
again
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case
the
courts
properly
ruled
that
the
claim
was
barred
by
rule
12
(b)
(2)
and
they
properly
denied
habeas
corpus
relief.
