justice

stewart
was
it
a
trial
of
him
alone,
i
notice
there
were
two
others
indicted?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
trial
was
of
him
alone?

potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice

there
is
nothing
new
about
the
idea
that
in
order
to
preserve
an
error
for
appellate
or
even
collateral
review
you
have
to
raise
it
in
a
timely
manner,
that's
i
would
guess
certainly
as
old
as
a
substantive
rule
that
you
can
refer
to,
isn’t
it,
as
a
doctrine
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
there
was
an
opportunity,
at
least
theoretically?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
mean
a
specific
opportunity
given
by
the
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
doesn’t
do
it,
it’s
a
--
it’s
just
common
ground.
it’s
just
a
run
of
the
mill,
jurisprudence
to
this
court.
if
he
doesn’t
raise
it
in
a
timely
manner,
he
has
lost
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no,
that’s
--
where
constitutional
rights
are
concerned.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
are,
every
term
of
this
court,
as
you
know?

no,

weren’t
in
those
two
