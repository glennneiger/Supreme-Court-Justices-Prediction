mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
this
case
which
is
here
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
presents
the
question
whether
petitioner
who
is
a
negro
may
challenge
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
federal
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
in
a
post
conviction
proceeding
where
the
claim
was
not
made
before
trial.
it
deals
with
the
scope
of
section
2255,
the
equivalent
of
habeas
corpus
for
federal
prisoners.
the
facts
are
that
petitioner,
who
is
black,
was
indicted
for
bank
robbery
in
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
in
january,
1968.
his
court
appointed
counsel
appeared
with
him
for
arraignment
several
weeks
afterwards
and
was
given
30
days
for
motions.
on
march
6,
the
motions
were
filed,
including
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
but
only
on
the
ground
that
the
arrest
which
led
to
his
indictment
was
illegal.
that
motion
was
denied.
the
case
went
to
trial.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
by
the
jury
and
sentenced
to
14
years
in
jail.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
were
two
others,
they
were
separately
charged
your
honor,
they
were
separate.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
was
sentenced
to
14
years
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
on
appeal
by
the
fifth
circuit.
and
although
it's
not
in
the
record,
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
davis
was
released
on
parole
last
august
after
serving
three
years
and
eleven
months
of
his
sentence.
in
january
1971,
davis
filed
a
motion
under
section
2255
alleging
that
negroes
were
systematically
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
which
had
handed
down
the
indictment
against
him.
and
he
specifically
rested
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
and
the
relevant
statutes
in
title
28,
which
were
then
applied.
he
also
alleged
that
his
attorney
in
fact
had
made
such
a
motion,
but
as
appears
from
the
opinions,
both
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
that
does
not
appear
in
the
printed
record,
but
i’ll
return
to
that
claim
later
on,
it's
not
terribly
important
at
this
stage.
at
the
same
time
that
davis
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
all
i
would
concede
about
his
claim
that
he
made
it
is
that
he
didn’t
intend
to
waive
it,
and
it
might
also
imply
that
he
knew
he
had
the
right
to
make
it.
but
what
would
have
to
be
gone
into
at
the
hearing
on
remand,
if
there
is
a
hearing
on
remand,
would
be,
what
reasons,
if
any,
his
lawyer
did
not
raise
that
if
davis
had
in
fact
wanted
him
to
raise
it.
but
that
is
an
issue
that
would
really
have
to
be
canvassed
and
would
go
to
the
whole
waiver
problem,
which
is
the
central
issue
in
the
case.
at
the
same
time
that
he
filed
this
2255
motion,
davis
also
filed
a
motion
for
a
discovery
and
inspection
of
facts
relating
to
the
claim
of
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
jury
selection
system
in
the
northern
district
of
california;
both
for
the
year
1968
and
for
the
20
years
preceded.
the
reply
by
the
government
was
in
effect
a
general
denial
which
pointed
out
that
he
had
not
raised
it
before
trial
as
extensively
required
by
rule
12
(b)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
also
denied
that
any
exclusion
was
practiced
in
the
district.
the
district
court,
without
granting
davis
a
hearing,
dismissed,
writing
an
opinion
saying
that
his
having
failed
to
raise
it
prior
to
trial
as
required
by
12
(b)
(2)
and
adhering
to
shotwell
that
he
had
waived
the
claim.
he
also
concluded
that
in
the
language
of
the
rule,
there
was
no
cause
shown
to
grant
relief
from
the
waiver
and
he
had
made
this
finding
also
without
having
granted
any
hearing.
the
case
--
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
a
very
brief
per
curiam
opinion,
it
too
relied
on
shotwell
versus
the
united
states
and
its
construction
of
12
(b)
(2).
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
what
he
said
was
a
pro
se
petition
your
honor.
what
he
said
was
that
it
had
been
raised,
he
alleged
that
in
the
petition.
he
said
that
the
--
his
court
appointed
attorney
had
made
an
oral
motion
before
trial.
but
the
district
court
searched
the
record,
read
the
transcripts,
said
it
couldn’t
find
any
reference
to
that
claim
having
been
raised,
and
it
is
at
this
point
a
disputed
claim,
a
fact,
which
the
district
court,
as
i
say,
found
on
the
basis
of
his
own
recollection
and
on
the
review
of
the
transcript.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
those
were
the
facts.
he
said
that
it
had
been
raised,
which
certainly
leads
to
the
implication
that
he
intended
it
to
be
raised
and
did
not
intend
for
it
to
be
waived.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
also
claimed
your
honor
that
he’d
--
that
had
--
that
he
did
not
waive
it
in
the
motion.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
the
original
burden
is
on
the
government
your
honor
and
then
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
initially
it’s
on
the
shoulders
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well.
he
did,
if
i
may
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
he
did
not
say
why,
but
it’s
ambiguous
of
course
because
although
he
said
he
didn’t
waive
it,
he
supported
that
by
saying
that
not
only
had
he
not
waived
it,
but
his
lawyer
had
in
fact
raised
it.
but
whether
or
not
it
can
be
proved
that
his
lawyer
raised
it,
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
waiver,
because
that
is
always
a
factual
question.
it
may
be
that
his
lawyer
will,
at
the
hearing,
testify
--
well,
he
could
testify
that
he
didn’t
raise
it
in
which
case
i
think
we
might
still
have
some
trouble
with
the
application
12
(b)
(2),
because
even
according
to
davis
he
didn’t
raise
it
before
a
trial,
he
raised
it
after
the
motions
were
to
be
filed.
but
he
could
either
testify
that
he
raised
it,
speaking
of
the
lawyer,
or
that
he
couldn’t
remember
whether
or
not
it
had
been
raised
or
that
he
hadn’t
raised
it
and
then
could
himself
testify
about
what
kind
of
conversations,
if
any,
if
he
had
with
davis
about
the
issue
of
jury
exclusion,
but
these
all
require
a
hearing.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
frankly
don’t
know
your
honor
why
he
didn’t
raise
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
but
i
don’t
think
that
pro
se
petitions
have
to
be
held
to
a
high
order
pleading
in
these
cases,
that
if
they
make
a
colorable
showing
by
a
constitutional
claim
and
alleged
in
general
terms
--
even
if
they
don't
use
the
word
waiver,
even
if
they
said
it
wasn’t
raised,
i
would
think
that,
that
should
be
adequate
for
purposes
of
habeas
review.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
again,
given
the
fact
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
yes
sir,
i
would.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
would
have
to.
again,
if
one
isn’t
going
to
hold
the
petitioner,
a
pro
se
petitioner
to
a
high
order
of
pleading,
i
think
that
on
a
colorable
case,
it's
more
or
less
something
like
a
prima
facie
case,
that
particularly
where
an
important
constitutional
right
such
as
exclusion
from
juries
is
concerned
that
the
--
that
a
district
court
should
hold
a
hearing
and
first
deal
of
course
with
the
question
--
factual
question
of
waiver
and
go
into
the
question
in
order
to
complete
the
summary
allegations
that
are
made
in
the
complaint.
but
i
think
it
always
has
to
be
a
factual
question,
and
i
think
it's
a
factual
question
which
demands
a
hearing.
i
suppose
there
are
some
cases
where
it
might
appear
on
--
in
the
pleadings
themselves
that
if
he
said,
i
discussed
with
my
attorney
and
we
agree
that
as
a
strategic
matter
we
were
not
going
to
raise
it
now,
because
i
wanted
to
save
it
for
a
post-conviction
proceeding,
that
he
wouldn’t
--
that
the
judge
wouldn’t
have
to
hold
a
hearing
in
that
case.
but
that
may
be
the
only
case
that
i
can
think
of.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
factual
question
on
the
waiver
there,
yes
sir.
but
i
would
think
that
--
that
would
appear
--
i
would
think
that,
that
would
appear
on
the
record,
on
the
face
of
the
record.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no.
well,
that’s
what
12
(b)
(2)
says
of
course.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
right.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
even
though
you
knew
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
because
the
man,
in
responding
to
justice
white’s
questioned,
the
defendant
himself
might
know
about
it,
but
his
lawyer
might
without
consultation
waive
it,
without
consulting
with
the
defendant,
and
if
he
does
not
consult
with
the
defendant
and
get
his
explicit
agreement
to
the
waiver,
certainly
of
a
very
important
constitutional
right,
certainly
one
of
the
dimension
involved
in
this
case,
i
think
that
the
question
of
waiver
is
still
a
live
question
on
a
post-conviction
procedure.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
rule
serves
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
rule
serves
the
purpose
of
encouraging
defense
counsel
to
discuss
the
issue
with
their
client,
that’s
the
purpose
it
serves.
it
encourages
these
claims
being
raised
before
a
trial
so
that
the
trial
can
proceed
in
orderly
way.
and
if
this
case
is
reversed,
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
notice
to
all
attorneys
where
there's
a
possible
question
of
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
jury
that
they
better
discuss
it
first
with
their
clients.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
we
could
only
hope
they
read
the
decisions
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
we
can
only
assume
that
they
always
read
your
opinions
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
how
to
deal
with
that
problem
with
lawyers
who
don’t
read
the
law.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
they
don't
communicate
and
if
the
lawyer
does
not
secure
the
explicit
waiver
of
the
defendant
on
that
claim,
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
automatically,
i
think
so.
i
can’t
see
any
other
alternative,
because
according
to
the
decision
by
this
court
in
noia
and
in
kaufman
which
apply,
noia
to
federal
defendants
and
taking
into
account
also
humphrey
v.
cady
last
term,
which
made
it
explicit
that
lawyers
have
to
consult
on
some
issues
with
their
clients
in
order
to
affect
a
effective
waiver.
there
are
some
issues
where
the
lawyer
is
going
to
have
to
talk
to
his
client
once
in
a
while
and
get
an
explicit
understanding
with
him,
that
he
is
waiving
a
substantial
constitutional
right
for
whatever
the
purpose
may
be.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
in
this
case
he
alleged
that
the
lawyer
made
the
motion
in
fact.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
allege
that
--
well,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
inconsistent,
it’s
the
--
the
motion
is
silent,
the
record
is
silent
about
the
extent
of
their
conversation.
in
any
case,
our
argument
in
summary
rests
upon
two
cases
decided
by
this
court,
kaufman
versus
united
states
and
noia
v.
fay,
which
together
hold
that
federal
defendants
in
2255
actions
may
raise
constitutional
issues
in
post-conviction
proceedings
to
the
exact
same
extent
that
state
prisoners
may
do
under
federal
habeas
corpus
and
that
both
are
qualified
only
by
the
rule
of
waiver
that’s
been
enunciated
in
noia.
secondly,
we
distinguish
shotwell
versus
united
states
as
not
having
application
in
this
case.
and
third,
we
argue
that
12
(b)
(2)
must
be
construed
in
waiver
terms
to
follow
the
decision
by
this
court
in
noia.
and
that,
that
can
be
done
easily
without,
as
the
government
suggests,
holding
12
(b)
(2)
unconstitutional,
because
12
(b)
(2)
in
fact
uses
the
term
waiver,
and
in
addition
allows
the
district
court
to
allow
a
motion
to
be
filed
late
with
just
--
with
good
cause.
and
our
position
essentially,
it
certainly
rejects
the
government’s
suggestion
that
12
(b)
(2)
has
to
be
held
unconstitutional.
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
held
unconstitutional.
it
merely
has
to
be
construed
consonantly
with
the
decision
in
noia
regarding
the
--
regarding
waiver.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
according
to
henry
and
according
to
humphrey
v.
cady,
i
think
that
this
court
has
told
lawyers
that
they
certainly
have
to
consult
with
their
clients
about
substantial
constitutional
issues.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
said
that
the
lawyer
had
a
consultant
that
he
hadn’t
--
and
since
they
haven’t
consulted,
they
haven’t
waived.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i’m
afraid
i
haven’t
reviewed
humphrey
v.
cady
close
--
closely
enough
to
respond.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
yes
sir.
well,
i
see
no
other
way
to
interpret
noia.
if
there
is
a
waiver,
that
the
waiver
has
to
be
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
but
henry
too
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
as
i
recall
henry,
henry
said
that
there
had
to
be
an
explicit
finding
of
waiver
by
the
defendant.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
knowledge
and
failure
to
object
in
consultation
with
the
defendant.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
mean,
that’s
--
obviously,
obviously
it’s
a
hard
--
it’s
a
--
might
be
a
burden
on
defense
counsel,
but
where
fundamental
and
substantial
constitutional
rights
are
concerned
it
may
be
a
burden
that
has
to
be
imposed
in
order
to
vindicate
the
constitutional
rights
of
defendants
in
criminal
cases.
we
think
that
this
claim
is
certainly
well
within
the
scope
of
the
kind
of
claims
that
this
court
said
in
kaufman
have
to
be
entertained
by
district
courts
on
section
2255
cases.
that
what's
at
stake
is
the
vindication
of
constitutional
rights
and
certainly
the
constitutional
right
which
is
asserted
in
this
case
is
one
that
this
court
has
required
to
be
vindicated
for
at
least
a
hundred
years.
it
is
an
elementary
right
and
the
courts
never,
never
swerve
from
its
consistent
position
that
the
exclusion
of
minority
groups
from
juries
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution
in
state
cases
or
in
federal
cases.
and
if
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
prevented,
because
of
this
procedural
default,
this
asserted
procedural
default
from
raising
this
elementary
constitutional
claim
then
i
think
that
the
court
will
be
retreating
from
this
100-year
course
of
decisions,
which
have
made
the
jury
exclusion
issue
a
primary
constitutional
issue.
as
far
as
shotwell
is
concerned
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
but
there's
a
whole
course
of
decisions
from
this
court
beginning
with
noia
and
including
kaufman
and
noia
itself
there,
although
that
wasn't
a
procedural
default
at
trial,
that
was
a
default
in
appeal
which
cut
him
off
from
state
remedies.
but
there
are
some
--
and
one
doesn’t
encourage
procedural
defaults
obviously,
but
one
does
say
that
where
important
constitutional
rights
of
defendants
are
concerned,
and
this
court
has
said
it
in
noia
and
said
it
in
kaufman,
that
there
has
to
be
a
forum
made
available
for
his
federal
rights
to
be
vindicated
if
he
didn’t
have
an
opportunity
to
have
them
heard
and
assessed
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
always
is.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there's
always
an
opportunity
for
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
there's
a
specific
opportunity
for
a
counsel
to
raise
all
constitutional
objections
all
along
the
course
of
trial.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
not
where
a
constitutional
rights
are
concerned.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that’s
certainly
wasn’t
the
case
in
kaufman.
it
certainly
wasn’t
the
case
in
noia.
i
mean,
they
were
raised
to
trial,
but
they
were
not
pursued
on
appeal.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
was
--
the
noia
discussion
revolved
entirely
around
the
question
of
procedural
default,
and
in
that
case
there
had
to
be
a
default
because
of
failure
to
appeal,
but
default
at
trial
seems
to
be
no
different
to
me,
that
a
--
the
defendant
--
a
defendant
oughtn't
to
be
held
to
have
forfeited
an
important
constitutional
right
because
of
a
decision
by
his
lawyer
in
which
he
did
not
join,
that’s
what
it
comes
to.
and
procedural
defaults
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
be
the
basis
for
loss
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
they
weren’t
in
kaufman,
they
weren’t
in
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
can
only
--
i
rely
on
those
two
cases
obviously,
and
i
also
rely
on
the
claim
that
constitutional
rights
are
too
important
to
be
forfeited
simply
because
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
a
waiver,
that’s
obviously
a
waiver.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
because
it's
a
deliberate
bypass
in
noia’s
terminology,
it’s
a
deliberate
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
the
fact
of
the
matter
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
best
one
is
in
this
very
case
arising
in
mississippi
on
behalf
of
a
black
defendant
and
there
are
a
whole
course
of
decisions
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i’m
not
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i’m
saying
that’s
a
possible
excuse.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
if
it’s
a
pro
se
petition
and
that,
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
surely,
if
i
were
to
join
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
i
was
--
if
i
were
to
join
the
petition
your
honor
i
would
like
to
think
that
i
would
plead
what
the
reason
was,
but
davis
drew
his
own
petition,
as
do
so
many
post-conviction
petitioners,
and
if
they're
going
to
be
held
to
the
fine
art
of
pleading
as
lawyers
can
properly
be,
they're
going
to
be
out
of
court
all
the
time.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
the
district
courts
would
do
that
explicitly
in
such
a
way
that
a
pro
se
petitioner
might
be
informed
of
the
reason
for
the
dismissal,
i
suppose
that
would
be
quite
agreeable,
but
in
the
absence
of
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
only
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
might
not
argue
against
that
very
much,
but
that
was
not
the
position
taken
by
the
district
court
here
of
course.
he
dismissed
outright
on
the
merits.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
could,
but
he
chose
to
take
an
appeal
however.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i’m
sorry?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
isn’t
that
his
lawyer
didn’t
talk
him,
it
was
your
honor
was
that,
his
lawyer
raised
the
issue.
that’s
on
page
8
of
the
record.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
on
top
of
page
8
he
alleges,
petitioner
avers
that
he
has
not
waived
nor
abandoned
his
right
to
contest
a
grand
jury
array
as
set
forth
in
rule
12
(b).
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
right.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
except
insofar
as
waiver
itself
is
a
fact
of
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
had
a
little
legal
knowledge
which
may
have
misled
him
in
that
sense.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
not
here
explicitly.
it's
here
only
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
only
insofar
as
it's
--
that’s
the
implication
in
paragraph
five
of
his
petition.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no.
paragraph
five
says
he
had
not
waived
nor
abandoned.
the
implication
of
that
could
well
be
that
his
lawyer
didn’t
talk
to
him.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
by
a
pro
se
petitioner
it
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
it
might
well
be
considered
as
an
adequate
pleading,
i
would
think
so.
i
mean,
i
don’t
know
whether
--
how
much
legal
knowledge
davis
actually
has.
he
had
some
knowledge
evidently
about
the
waiver
issue,
was
not
totally
uninformed
on
it,
but
i
don’t
know
whether
he
knew
what
would
constitute
a
waiver
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
would
think
that
it
conclusionary
pleading
like
this
that
is
conclusory
would
--
ought
to
be
taken
by
the
district
court
as
an
adequate
allegation.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
either
has
some
legal
knowledge
or
he
secured
some
while
he
is
in
the
penitentiary.
this
was
filed
while
he
was
in
prison.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
what
this
is
all
about
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it
wasn’t
all
it
was
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
was
a
claim
that
negroes
were
systematically
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
and
that’s
no
minor
claim,
that’s
a
very
important
claim.
and
when
that
is
alleged
and
where
--
the
additional
facts
are
alleged
even
in
conclusory
terms
that
the
defendant
did
not
waive
it,
i
think,
and
perhaps
in
addition,
given
the
fact
that
this
case
arouse
in
mississippi
and
given
the
history
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals’
decisions
regarding
state
prisoners
and
their
recognition
of
the
special
problem
in
the
state
of
mississippi
regarding
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
juries,
that
this
case
demanded
a
hearing
on
the
facts.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
this
was
tried
in
a
federal
court,
yes
sir.
but
i
don’t
know
--
and
there
is
of
course
the
distinctive
treatment
that
the
fifth
circuit
applies
to
state
cases
and
to
federal
cases
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
they
reversed
a
fair
number,
a
large
number
of
state
cases
on
exclusion
grounds
on
federal
habeas,
and
on
the
other
hand,
in
this
case
and
in
others,
they
have
refused
to
allow
such
claims
to
be
raised
if
they
weren’t
properly
raised,
timely
raised
under
12
(b)
(2).
the
implication
being
that
they
are
not
making
the
same
kind
of
assumptions
about
the
practice
in
federal
courts
as
they
very
readily
have
made
about
the
practice
in
state
courts.
but
that’s
only
an
assumption,
and
again,
a
factual
hearing
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
practices
are
in
the
northern
district
of
mississippi.
and
i
might
say
that
the
affidavits
which
the
government
filed
in
some
other
case
here,
including
the
affidavits
of
67
attorneys
in
--
from
practicing
in
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
mean
nothing.
those
67
affidavits
with
four
exceptions
are
written
in
precisely
the
same
terms
and
exactly
the
same
language.
i
think
they
are
prepared
by
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office
and
circulated
through
his
friends
in
the
northern
district.
and
there's
no
allegations
there
except
by
lawyers,
conclusionary
allegations
that
significant
numbers
of
blacks
have
appeared
on
juries,
but
that's
certainly
not
a
any
kind
of
a
determination
that
ought
to
persuade
any
of
us
that
the
jury
selection
procedures
in
the
northern
district
are
adequate.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
this
case
which
is
here
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
presents
the
question
whether
petitioner
who
is
a
negro
may
challenge
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
federal
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
in
a
post
conviction
proceeding
where
the
claim
was
not
made
before
trial.
it
deals
with
the
scope
of
section
2255,
the
equivalent
of
habeas
corpus
for
federal
prisoners.
the
facts
are
that
petitioner,
who
is
black,
was
indicted
for
bank
robbery
in
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
in
january,
1968.
his
court
appointed
counsel
appeared
with
him
for
arraignment
several
weeks
afterwards
and
was
given
30
days
for
motions.
on
march
6,
the
motions
were
filed,
including
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
but
only
on
the
ground
that
the
arrest
which
led
to
his
indictment
was
illegal.
that
motion
was
denied.
the
case
went
to
trial.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
by
the
jury
and
sentenced
to
14
years
in
jail.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
were
two
others,
they
were
separately
charged
your
honor,
they
were
separate.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
was
sentenced
to
14
years
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
on
appeal
by
the
fifth
circuit.
and
although
it's
not
in
the
record,
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
davis
was
released
on
parole
last
august
after
serving
three
years
and
eleven
months
of
his
sentence.
in
january
1971,
davis
filed
a
motion
under
section
2255
alleging
that
negroes
were
systematically
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
which
had
handed
down
the
indictment
against
him.
and
he
specifically
rested
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
and
the
relevant
statutes
in
title
28,
which
were
then
applied.
he
also
alleged
that
his
attorney
in
fact
had
made
such
a
motion,
but
as
appears
from
the
opinions,
both
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
that
does
not
appear
in
the
printed
record,
but
i’ll
return
to
that
claim
later
on,
it's
not
terribly
important
at
this
stage.
at
the
same
time
that
davis
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
all
i
would
concede
about
his
claim
that
he
made
it
is
that
he
didn’t
intend
to
waive
it,
and
it
might
also
imply
that
he
knew
he
had
the
right
to
make
it.
but
what
would
have
to
be
gone
into
at
the
hearing
on
remand,
if
there
is
a
hearing
on
remand,
would
be,
what
reasons,
if
any,
his
lawyer
did
not
raise
that
if
davis
had
in
fact
wanted
him
to
raise
it.
but
that
is
an
issue
that
would
really
have
to
be
canvassed
and
would
go
to
the
whole
waiver
problem,
which
is
the
central
issue
in
the
case.
at
the
same
time
that
he
filed
this
2255
motion,
davis
also
filed
a
motion
for
a
discovery
and
inspection
of
facts
relating
to
the
claim
of
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
jury
selection
system
in
the
northern
district
of
california;
both
for
the
year
1968
and
for
the
20
years
preceded.
the
reply
by
the
government
was
in
effect
a
general
denial
which
pointed
out
that
he
had
not
raised
it
before
trial
as
extensively
required
by
rule
12
(b)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
also
denied
that
any
exclusion
was
practiced
in
the
district.
the
district
court,
without
granting
davis
a
hearing,
dismissed,
writing
an
opinion
saying
that
his
having
failed
to
raise
it
prior
to
trial
as
required
by
12
(b)
(2)
and
adhering
to
shotwell
that
he
had
waived
the
claim.
he
also
concluded
that
in
the
language
of
the
rule,
there
was
no
cause
shown
to
grant
relief
from
the
waiver
and
he
had
made
this
finding
also
without
having
granted
any
hearing.
the
case
--
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
a
very
brief
per
curiam
opinion,
it
too
relied
on
shotwell
versus
the
united
states
and
its
construction
of
12
(b)
(2).
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
what
he
said
was
a
pro
se
petition
your
honor.
what
he
said
was
that
it
had
been
raised,
he
alleged
that
in
the
petition.
he
said
that
the
--
his
court
appointed
attorney
had
made
an
oral
motion
before
trial.
but
the
district
court
searched
the
record,
read
the
transcripts,
said
it
couldn’t
find
any
reference
to
that
claim
having
been
raised,
and
it
is
at
this
point
a
disputed
claim,
a
fact,
which
the
district
court,
as
i
say,
found
on
the
basis
of
his
own
recollection
and
on
the
review
of
the
transcript.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
those
were
the
facts.
he
said
that
it
had
been
raised,
which
certainly
leads
to
the
implication
that
he
intended
it
to
be
raised
and
did
not
intend
for
it
to
be
waived.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
also
claimed
your
honor
that
he’d
--
that
had
--
that
he
did
not
waive
it
in
the
motion.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
the
original
burden
is
on
the
government
your
honor
and
then
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
initially
it’s
on
the
shoulders
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well.
he
did,
if
i
may
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
he
did
not
say
why,
but
it’s
ambiguous
of
course
because
although
he
said
he
didn’t
waive
it,
he
supported
that
by
saying
that
not
only
had
he
not
waived
it,
but
his
lawyer
had
in
fact
raised
it.
but
whether
or
not
it
can
be
proved
that
his
lawyer
raised
it,
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
waiver,
because
that
is
always
a
factual
question.
it
may
be
that
his
lawyer
will,
at
the
hearing,
testify
--
well,
he
could
testify
that
he
didn’t
raise
it
in
which
case
i
think
we
might
still
have
some
trouble
with
the
application
12
(b)
(2),
because
even
according
to
davis
he
didn’t
raise
it
before
a
trial,
he
raised
it
after
the
motions
were
to
be
filed.
but
he
could
either
testify
that
he
raised
it,
speaking
of
the
lawyer,
or
that
he
couldn’t
remember
whether
or
not
it
had
been
raised
or
that
he
hadn’t
raised
it
and
then
could
himself
testify
about
what
kind
of
conversations,
if
any,
if
he
had
with
davis
about
the
issue
of
jury
exclusion,
but
these
all
require
a
hearing.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
frankly
don’t
know
your
honor
why
he
didn’t
raise
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
but
i
don’t
think
that
pro
se
petitions
have
to
be
held
to
a
high
order
pleading
in
these
cases,
that
if
they
make
a
colorable
showing
by
a
constitutional
claim
and
alleged
in
general
terms
--
even
if
they
don't
use
the
word
waiver,
even
if
they
said
it
wasn’t
raised,
i
would
think
that,
that
should
be
adequate
for
purposes
of
habeas
review.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
again,
given
the
fact
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
yes
sir,
i
would.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
would
have
to.
again,
if
one
isn’t
going
to
hold
the
petitioner,
a
pro
se
petitioner
to
a
high
order
of
pleading,
i
think
that
on
a
colorable
case,
it's
more
or
less
something
like
a
prima
facie
case,
that
particularly
where
an
important
constitutional
right
such
as
exclusion
from
juries
is
concerned
that
the
--
that
a
district
court
should
hold
a
hearing
and
first
deal
of
course
with
the
question
--
factual
question
of
waiver
and
go
into
the
question
in
order
to
complete
the
summary
allegations
that
are
made
in
the
complaint.
but
i
think
it
always
has
to
be
a
factual
question,
and
i
think
it's
a
factual
question
which
demands
a
hearing.
i
suppose
there
are
some
cases
where
it
might
appear
on
--
in
the
pleadings
themselves
that
if
he
said,
i
discussed
with
my
attorney
and
we
agree
that
as
a
strategic
matter
we
were
not
going
to
raise
it
now,
because
i
wanted
to
save
it
for
a
post-conviction
proceeding,
that
he
wouldn’t
--
that
the
judge
wouldn’t
have
to
hold
a
hearing
in
that
case.
but
that
may
be
the
only
case
that
i
can
think
of.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
factual
question
on
the
waiver
there,
yes
sir.
but
i
would
think
that
--
that
would
appear
--
i
would
think
that,
that
would
appear
on
the
record,
on
the
face
of
the
record.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no.
well,
that’s
what
12
(b)
(2)
says
of
course.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
right.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
even
though
you
knew
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
because
the
man,
in
responding
to
justice
white’s
questioned,
the
defendant
himself
might
know
about
it,
but
his
lawyer
might
without
consultation
waive
it,
without
consulting
with
the
defendant,
and
if
he
does
not
consult
with
the
defendant
and
get
his
explicit
agreement
to
the
waiver,
certainly
of
a
very
important
constitutional
right,
certainly
one
of
the
dimension
involved
in
this
case,
i
think
that
the
question
of
waiver
is
still
a
live
question
on
a
post-conviction
procedure.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
rule
serves
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
rule
serves
the
purpose
of
encouraging
defense
counsel
to
discuss
the
issue
with
their
client,
that’s
the
purpose
it
serves.
it
encourages
these
claims
being
raised
before
a
trial
so
that
the
trial
can
proceed
in
orderly
way.
and
if
this
case
is
reversed,
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
notice
to
all
attorneys
where
there's
a
possible
question
of
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
jury
that
they
better
discuss
it
first
with
their
clients.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
we
could
only
hope
they
read
the
decisions
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
we
can
only
assume
that
they
always
read
your
opinions
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
how
to
deal
with
that
problem
with
lawyers
who
don’t
read
the
law.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
they
don't
communicate
and
if
the
lawyer
does
not
secure
the
explicit
waiver
of
the
defendant
on
that
claim,
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
automatically,
i
think
so.
i
can’t
see
any
other
alternative,
because
according
to
the
decision
by
this
court
in
noia
and
in
kaufman
which
apply,
noia
to
federal
defendants
and
taking
into
account
also
humphrey
v.
cady
last
term,
which
made
it
explicit
that
lawyers
have
to
consult
on
some
issues
with
their
clients
in
order
to
affect
a
effective
waiver.
there
are
some
issues
where
the
lawyer
is
going
to
have
to
talk
to
his
client
once
in
a
while
and
get
an
explicit
understanding
with
him,
that
he
is
waiving
a
substantial
constitutional
right
for
whatever
the
purpose
may
be.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
in
this
case
he
alleged
that
the
lawyer
made
the
motion
in
fact.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
allege
that
--
well,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
inconsistent,
it’s
the
--
the
motion
is
silent,
the
record
is
silent
about
the
extent
of
their
conversation.
in
any
case,
our
argument
in
summary
rests
upon
two
cases
decided
by
this
court,
kaufman
versus
united
states
and
noia
v.
fay,
which
together
hold
that
federal
defendants
in
2255
actions
may
raise
constitutional
issues
in
post-conviction
proceedings
to
the
exact
same
extent
that
state
prisoners
may
do
under
federal
habeas
corpus
and
that
both
are
qualified
only
by
the
rule
of
waiver
that’s
been
enunciated
in
noia.
secondly,
we
distinguish
shotwell
versus
united
states
as
not
having
application
in
this
case.
and
third,
we
argue
that
12
(b)
(2)
must
be
construed
in
waiver
terms
to
follow
the
decision
by
this
court
in
noia.
and
that,
that
can
be
done
easily
without,
as
the
government
suggests,
holding
12
(b)
(2)
unconstitutional,
because
12
(b)
(2)
in
fact
uses
the
term
waiver,
and
in
addition
allows
the
district
court
to
allow
a
motion
to
be
filed
late
with
just
--
with
good
cause.
and
our
position
essentially,
it
certainly
rejects
the
government’s
suggestion
that
12
(b)
(2)
has
to
be
held
unconstitutional.
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
held
unconstitutional.
it
merely
has
to
be
construed
consonantly
with
the
decision
in
noia
regarding
the
--
regarding
waiver.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
according
to
henry
and
according
to
humphrey
v.
cady,
i
think
that
this
court
has
told
lawyers
that
they
certainly
have
to
consult
with
their
clients
about
substantial
constitutional
issues.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
said
that
the
lawyer
had
a
consultant
that
he
hadn’t
--
and
since
they
haven’t
consulted,
they
haven’t
waived.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i’m
afraid
i
haven’t
reviewed
humphrey
v.
cady
close
--
closely
enough
to
respond.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
yes
sir.
well,
i
see
no
other
way
to
interpret
noia.
if
there
is
a
waiver,
that
the
waiver
has
to
be
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
but
henry
too
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
as
i
recall
henry,
henry
said
that
there
had
to
be
an
explicit
finding
of
waiver
by
the
defendant.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
knowledge
and
failure
to
object
in
consultation
with
the
defendant.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
mean,
that’s
--
obviously,
obviously
it’s
a
hard
--
it’s
a
--
might
be
a
burden
on
defense
counsel,
but
where
fundamental
and
substantial
constitutional
rights
are
concerned
it
may
be
a
burden
that
has
to
be
imposed
in
order
to
vindicate
the
constitutional
rights
of
defendants
in
criminal
cases.
we
think
that
this
claim
is
certainly
well
within
the
scope
of
the
kind
of
claims
that
this
court
said
in
kaufman
have
to
be
entertained
by
district
courts
on
section
2255
cases.
that
what's
at
stake
is
the
vindication
of
constitutional
rights
and
certainly
the
constitutional
right
which
is
asserted
in
this
case
is
one
that
this
court
has
required
to
be
vindicated
for
at
least
a
hundred
years.
it
is
an
elementary
right
and
the
courts
never,
never
swerve
from
its
consistent
position
that
the
exclusion
of
minority
groups
from
juries
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution
in
state
cases
or
in
federal
cases.
and
if
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
prevented,
because
of
this
procedural
default,
this
asserted
procedural
default
from
raising
this
elementary
constitutional
claim
then
i
think
that
the
court
will
be
retreating
from
this
100-year
course
of
decisions,
which
have
made
the
jury
exclusion
issue
a
primary
constitutional
issue.
as
far
as
shotwell
is
concerned
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
but
there's
a
whole
course
of
decisions
from
this
court
beginning
with
noia
and
including
kaufman
and
noia
itself
there,
although
that
wasn't
a
procedural
default
at
trial,
that
was
a
default
in
appeal
which
cut
him
off
from
state
remedies.
but
there
are
some
--
and
one
doesn’t
encourage
procedural
defaults
obviously,
but
one
does
say
that
where
important
constitutional
rights
of
defendants
are
concerned,
and
this
court
has
said
it
in
noia
and
said
it
in
kaufman,
that
there
has
to
be
a
forum
made
available
for
his
federal
rights
to
be
vindicated
if
he
didn’t
have
an
opportunity
to
have
them
heard
and
assessed
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
always
is.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there's
always
an
opportunity
for
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
there's
a
specific
opportunity
for
a
counsel
to
raise
all
constitutional
objections
all
along
the
course
of
trial.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
not
where
a
constitutional
rights
are
concerned.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that’s
certainly
wasn’t
the
case
in
kaufman.
it
certainly
wasn’t
the
case
in
noia.
i
mean,
they
were
raised
to
trial,
but
they
were
not
pursued
on
appeal.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
was
--
the
noia
discussion
revolved
entirely
around
the
question
of
procedural
default,
and
in
that
case
there
had
to
be
a
default
because
of
failure
to
appeal,
but
default
at
trial
seems
to
be
no
different
to
me,
that
a
--
the
defendant
--
a
defendant
oughtn't
to
be
held
to
have
forfeited
an
important
constitutional
right
because
of
a
decision
by
his
lawyer
in
which
he
did
not
join,
that’s
what
it
comes
to.
and
procedural
defaults
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
be
the
basis
for
loss
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
they
weren’t
in
kaufman,
they
weren’t
in
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
can
only
--
i
rely
on
those
two
cases
obviously,
and
i
also
rely
on
the
claim
that
constitutional
rights
are
too
important
to
be
forfeited
simply
because
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
a
waiver,
that’s
obviously
a
waiver.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
because
it's
a
deliberate
bypass
in
noia’s
terminology,
it’s
a
deliberate
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
the
fact
of
the
matter
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
best
one
is
in
this
very
case
arising
in
mississippi
on
behalf
of
a
black
defendant
and
there
are
a
whole
course
of
decisions
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i’m
not
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i’m
saying
that’s
a
possible
excuse.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
if
it’s
a
pro
se
petition
and
that,
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
surely,
if
i
were
to
join
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
i
was
--
if
i
were
to
join
the
petition
your
honor
i
would
like
to
think
that
i
would
plead
what
the
reason
was,
but
davis
drew
his
own
petition,
as
do
so
many
post-conviction
petitioners,
and
if
they're
going
to
be
held
to
the
fine
art
of
pleading
as
lawyers
can
properly
be,
they're
going
to
be
out
of
court
all
the
time.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
the
district
courts
would
do
that
explicitly
in
such
a
way
that
a
pro
se
petitioner
might
be
informed
of
the
reason
for
the
dismissal,
i
suppose
that
would
be
quite
agreeable,
but
in
the
absence
of
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
only
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
might
not
argue
against
that
very
much,
but
that
was
not
the
position
taken
by
the
district
court
here
of
course.
he
dismissed
outright
on
the
merits.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
could,
but
he
chose
to
take
an
appeal
however.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i’m
sorry?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
isn’t
that
his
lawyer
didn’t
talk
him,
it
was
your
honor
was
that,
his
lawyer
raised
the
issue.
that’s
on
page
8
of
the
record.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
on
top
of
page
8
he
alleges,
petitioner
avers
that
he
has
not
waived
nor
abandoned
his
right
to
contest
a
grand
jury
array
as
set
forth
in
rule
12
(b).
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
right.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
except
insofar
as
waiver
itself
is
a
fact
of
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
had
a
little
legal
knowledge
which
may
have
misled
him
in
that
sense.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
not
here
explicitly.
it's
here
only
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
only
insofar
as
it's
--
that’s
the
implication
in
paragraph
five
of
his
petition.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no.
paragraph
five
says
he
had
not
waived
nor
abandoned.
the
implication
of
that
could
well
be
that
his
lawyer
didn’t
talk
to
him.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
by
a
pro
se
petitioner
it
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
it
might
well
be
considered
as
an
adequate
pleading,
i
would
think
so.
i
mean,
i
don’t
know
whether
--
how
much
legal
knowledge
davis
actually
has.
he
had
some
knowledge
evidently
about
the
waiver
issue,
was
not
totally
uninformed
on
it,
but
i
don’t
know
whether
he
knew
what
would
constitute
a
waiver
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
would
think
that
it
conclusionary
pleading
like
this
that
is
conclusory
would
--
ought
to
be
taken
by
the
district
court
as
an
adequate
allegation.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
either
has
some
legal
knowledge
or
he
secured
some
while
he
is
in
the
penitentiary.
this
was
filed
while
he
was
in
prison.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
what
this
is
all
about
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it
wasn’t
all
it
was
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
was
a
claim
that
negroes
were
systematically
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
and
that’s
no
minor
claim,
that’s
a
very
important
claim.
and
when
that
is
alleged
and
where
--
the
additional
facts
are
alleged
even
in
conclusory
terms
that
the
defendant
did
not
waive
it,
i
think,
and
perhaps
in
addition,
given
the
fact
that
this
case
arouse
in
mississippi
and
given
the
history
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals’
decisions
regarding
state
prisoners
and
their
recognition
of
the
special
problem
in
the
state
of
mississippi
regarding
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
juries,
that
this
case
demanded
a
hearing
on
the
facts.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
this
was
tried
in
a
federal
court,
yes
sir.
but
i
don’t
know
--
and
there
is
of
course
the
distinctive
treatment
that
the
fifth
circuit
applies
to
state
cases
and
to
federal
cases
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
they
reversed
a
fair
number,
a
large
number
of
state
cases
on
exclusion
grounds
on
federal
habeas,
and
on
the
other
hand,
in
this
case
and
in
others,
they
have
refused
to
allow
such
claims
to
be
raised
if
they
weren’t
properly
raised,
timely
raised
under
12
(b)
(2).
the
implication
being
that
they
are
not
making
the
same
kind
of
assumptions
about
the
practice
in
federal
courts
as
they
very
readily
have
made
about
the
practice
in
state
courts.
but
that’s
only
an
assumption,
and
again,
a
factual
hearing
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
practices
are
in
the
northern
district
of
mississippi.
and
i
might
say
that
the
affidavits
which
the
government
filed
in
some
other
case
here,
including
the
affidavits
of
67
attorneys
in
--
from
practicing
in
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
mean
nothing.
those
67
affidavits
with
four
exceptions
are
written
in
precisely
the
same
terms
and
exactly
the
same
language.
i
think
they
are
prepared
by
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office
and
circulated
through
his
friends
in
the
northern
district.
and
there's
no
allegations
there
except
by
lawyers,
conclusionary
allegations
that
significant
numbers
of
blacks
have
appeared
on
juries,
but
that's
certainly
not
a
any
kind
of
a
determination
that
ought
to
persuade
any
of
us
that
the
jury
selection
procedures
in
the
northern
district
are
adequate.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
thank
you.
