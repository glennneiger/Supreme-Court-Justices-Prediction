do
you
mean
that
they
would
reject
an
ad
if
it
said
'middle
aged
women
wants
housekeeping
job'?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
see
now
a
first
amendment
problem
in
either
rejecting
or
trying
to
control
an
ad
'middle
aged
woman
wants
housekeeping
job'.
chief

mr.

chief

e.

we
will
pick

after
lunch

you

no,
the
newspaper
sets
up
the
framework
but
the
advertiser,
by
placing
an
advertisement
in
this
sex
segregated
column
is
discriminating.
i
think
mrs.
matson
will
get
into
this
in
more
detail,
but
the
ordinance
defines
discrimination
as
any
difference
on
the
basis
of
sex
and
by
placing
an
ad
in
the
sex
segregated
column,
the
advertiser
is
discriminating
and
the
newspaper
is
aiding
that.
what
about
the
hypothetical
situation
i
put
to
your
friend
about
the
man
or
the
woman
who
is
middle
aged
that
has
no
skill,
except
knows
how
to
take
care
of
a
house;
putting
an
ad
in
the
paper,
a
middle
aged
women
wishes
housekeeping
job
living
in.
no
problem
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
yours
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
let
me
turn
it
around
the
other
way
now.
now,
we
have
a
man
who
has
a
wife,
who
is
a
semi-invalid
and
two
small,
at
least
adolescent
children
and
he
wants
a
housekeeper,
who
is
a
woman
and
he
would
like
some
stable
middle
aged
women.
can
he
specify
all
of
that
in
the
ad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
now
let's
move
over
and
now
it's
an
employment
agency
doing
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
at
least
you
can't
refuse
them
on
that
ground,
prohibit
more
narrowly
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
separate
the
first
amendment
completely
from
the
economic
aspect,
but
could
a
newspaper
survive
if
it
just
sold
the
newspaper
to
readers
without
any
advertising?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
