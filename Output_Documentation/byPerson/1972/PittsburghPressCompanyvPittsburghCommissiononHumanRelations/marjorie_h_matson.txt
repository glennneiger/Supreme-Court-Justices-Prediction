ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
thank
you
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
court.
i
am
representing
in
this
proceeding,
the
national
organization
for
women.
the
national
organization
for
women,
as
i
am
sure
you
must
have
heard
and
read
in
the
newspapers
with
no
hierarchy,
is
an
organization,
which
is
committed
to
the
advancement
of
the
rights
of
women
to
the
elimination
of
discrimination
based
upon
sex.
it
has
been
in
existence
for
a
number
of
years
and
in
this
case,
the
original
complaint
was
filed
by
a
male
member
of
now
gerald
gardner,
the
treasurer
of
the
organization
and
an
active
member
in
the
group.
the
organization
participated
in
offering
testimony
at
the
commission
and
was
instrumental
in
bringing
in
the
federal
officials
who
testify
in
support
of
the
policy
which
was
adapted
by
the
city
ordinance
and
which
was
being,
we
contended,
violated
in
terms
of
the
want-ad
classifications
used
in
the
pittsburgh
press
and
the
only
other
metropolitan
newspaper
the
post-gazette.
the
commission
found
in
our
favor
and
made
specific
findings
of
fact,
which
were
then
affirmed
by
the
higher
state
court
to
review
this,
the
commonwealth
court,
should
be
fairly
conclusive
of
the
issues
involved
here,
particularly
in
terms
of
the
limitations
which
this
court
has
observed
in
recent
years,
as
to
the
review
of
substantive
due
process
questions.
now,
of
course,
the
real
thrust
of
this
case
is
the
attempt
by
women
to
abolish
a
very
important,
albeit
it
may
seem
subtle,
attempt
to
keep
women
in
the
place
that
they
have
traditionally
been.
and
in
fact,
the
argument
for
petitioner
suggest
this.
they
talk
about
women
being
secretaries
and
apparently
this
is
the
basis
for
their
whole
classification
system,
that
is
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
jobs
which
women
have
had
traditionally
and
therefore
they
should
ought
to
go
on
having
in
the
future.
now
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
failing
on
the
part
of
no
doubt,
some
of
the
employers
who
advertise
in
the
paper
and
certainly
by
their
own
admission
on
the
part
of
the
newspaper
that
women
should
be
kept
in
their
place
and
this
is
the
issue
involved
here
as
to
whether
they
may,
in
fact,
to
do
that
in
view
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
due
process
clause,
the
other
aspects
of
the
federal
constitution
which
have
served
to
bring
black
people
out
of
bondage,
and
which
now
we
are
calling
upon
to
serve
as
a
way
of
meeting
the
economic
problems
of
women.
at
the
hearings
before
the
commission,
and
we
have
given
you
some
statistics
in
our
brief
as
well
and
other
of
the
amicus
briefs
contain
economic
data
here,
which
is
of
great
significance
in
this
case,
because
it
does
establish
that
women
have
been
discriminated
against
job
wise;
that
they
have
been
deterred
from
applying
for
jobs,
because
they
believe
that
they
were
not
welcomed.
and
at
this
point
in
the
process,
the
deterrence
from
even
applying
for
a
job,
that
the
pittsburgh
press
comes
into
the
picture.
these
classification
had
--
as
you
now
are
very
well
aware,
were
set
up
by
the
press,
but
the
place
where
the
ad
is
to
go,
whether
it
is
to
go
under
female
interest
or
male
interest
is
determined,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
press
employees
who
appeared,
as
being
the
decision
of
the
employer
himself.
now
the
covered
employer,
who
comes
to
advertise
and
who
wants
to
discriminate
against
women,
but
knows
that
it's
against
the
law
and
that
he
can't
put
in
an
ad
saying
males
only
or
can't
put
it
under
a
males
only
heading,
can
turn
from
this
euphemism
which
is
now
being
used
by
the
paper;
the
same
headings
that
were
used
before
--
the
headings
that
were
used
before
were
male
jobs,
female
jobs,
help
wanted
for
a
male
or
female.
now
they
have
changed
that
only
slightly,
only
to
say
male
interest,
female
interest,
so
that
the
same
stress
will
look
under
female
interest
jobs
and
the
tailor,
who
makes
much
more
will
look
under
the
male
interest
jobs
and
this
is
such
a
--
ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
well,
your
honor,
the
ordinance
itself
provides
for
people
to
get
a
certificate,
if
they
want
--
if
there
is
a
bona
fide
occupation
qualification,
but
we
are
trying
to
break
down
the
classification
system.
ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
yes.
ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
well,
that
question,
i
guess,
would
have
to
be
addressed
to
the
press.
ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
well,
your
honor,
the
thing
is
that
we
could
knock
off
one
employment
agency
after
another
and
go
through
all
of
those,
that's
clearest
cut
case
here.
i
suppose
get
each
of
them
enjoined
from
carrying
the
ad.
ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
it's
a
way
--
well,
there
are
two
but
they
are
published
together,
so
it's
the
same
difference,
but
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
to
get
at
the
advertising,
which
is
the
thing,
which
--
the
advertising
headings,
which
are
the
message
which
is
being
conveyed
to
women
that
they
should
stay
away
from
applying
for
a
particular
job.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
said
in
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
in
this
case,
the
only
message
meaningfully
communicated
by
the
headings
is
that
employers
advertising
thereunder
will
discriminate
and
they
will
hire,
and
that
thus
it
does
serve
as
a
deterrence
you
see
to
women
applying.
it's
not
anything
that
is
said
in
the
ad
itself,
rather
it
is
the
headings
under
which
the
ads
appear,
which
deters
women
from
applying
jobs,
for
jobs
for
which
they
may
very
well
be
qualified.
ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
well,
then
you
see
you
would
be
left
--
ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
i
don't
know
that
you
could,
and
as
a
communication
of
that
kind
i
shouldn't
think
that
we
can
reach
that
very
readily,
your
honor.
ms.
marjorie
h.
matson
it
seems
to
me
that
you
would
have
to
enjoin
the
individual
employment
agency
or
employer
from
advertising
under
a
male
help
wanted
column
or
a
female
as
the
case
maybe.
and
in
that
case,
i
suppose
that
those
employers
could
resort
to
the
male,
female
heading
which
is
available,
and
which
is
practically
not
used
at
all,
in
terms
of
the
column
inches
of
spaces,
only
a
100
and
in
an
average
issue
of
sunday
paper,
as
compared
with
1600
column
inches
of
male
ads
and
400
for
female
ads.
so,
that
you
would
have
immensely
difficult
problem
of
reaching
each
of
the
employers,
and
it
is
a
job
which
really
is
not
forced
upon
us
when
we
have
the
ordinance
which
says
that,
anyone
who
aids
in
discrimination,
and
we
say
that
these
headings
are
an
aid,
can
be
reached
directly,
and
this
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do
in
this
case
your
honor.
