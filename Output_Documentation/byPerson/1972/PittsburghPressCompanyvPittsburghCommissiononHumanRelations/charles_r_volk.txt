mr.
charles
r.
volk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
pittsburgh
press
company
has,
as
most
newspapers
in
the
country
did
have,
a
system
and
still
do,
i
might
add,
a
system
of
classifying
its
'help
wanted'
advertisements
under
either
male
or
female.
some
time
after
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
after
eeoc
guidelines
which
indicated
that
male
and
female
as
such
might
be
proscribed
and
after
the
eeoc
promulgated
some
alternative
guidelines
which
have
since
been
overturned
again
by
the
eeoc
in
one
of
their
changes
of
guidelines,
the
pittsburgh
press
went
to
a
system
of
male
interest
and
female
interest
in
a
third
column
heading
male-female.
appropriately
and
prominently
displayed
in
the
want-ads
themselves
at
the
heads
of
the
columns
were
a
rather
large
disclaimer
box
entitled
"notice
to
job
seekers"
which
pointed
out
that
the
classification
was
for
reader
interest
only,
and
should
not
be
construed
as
being
a
limitation
since
most
laws
--
there
were
laws
in
most
jurisdictions
which
proscribed
discrimination
on
the
basis
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
as
to
which
column
each
ad
went
in?
the
record
is
fairly
complete
on
that
mr.
justice
white.
the
system
is
that
the
advertiser
calls
up
and
in
essence
says
where
he
wants
it.
if
he
does
not
express
preference
for
placement
of
the
ad,
the
newspaper
will
help
him
where
most
ads
of
this
type
'secretaries
female',
'truck
driver
male'
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yeah
the
newspaper
will
help.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
it
makes
the
final
--
it
reserves
for
itself
the
final
determination,
but
i
would
be
fatuous
and
untrue
if
i
told
this
court
that
that's
the
way
it
happens
in
actual
practice.
in
actual
practice
the
advertiser
who
is
seeking
an
employee
calls
up
and
says
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
yes
sir
that’s
essentially
the
way
it
works.
and
now
we
have
male
interest
and
female
interest.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
passed
an
ordinance
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
it
isn't
its
judgment
in
any
specific
case.
i
would
be
fatuous
if
i
say
that.
however,
we
do
contend
that
the
newspaper
gets
into
the
act
by
making
an
editorial
decision
that
there
are
jobs,
there
is
a
large
body
of
differing
interest
between
males
and
females
as
they
relate
to
the
job
market,
and
it
is
the
decision
of
the
newspaper
to
run
column
headings
appealing
to
this
reader
interest
and
permitting
advertisers
to
place
job
in
there.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes
they
would.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
not
on
the
record.
there
could
be
oportunity
--
there
could
be,
of
course,
occasions
where
the
newspaper
would
nudge
it
into
one
or
refuse
to
carry,
refuse
to
carry
perhaps
a
go-go
dancer
in
the
male
section,
but
we
can
search
throughout
the
record
and
not
find
any
reference
to
that.
i
don't
believe
sir,
we
read
the
record
very
carefully
prior
to
this
hearing.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
absolutely
sir
that's
why
we
are
here.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
it
is
the
very
strongly
held
opinion,
scripps-howard
newspapers
who
have
the
controlling
interest
in
the
pittsburgh
press
and
in
the
pittsburgh
press
that
this
does
serve
a
legitimate
reader
and
advertiser
function
in
providing
a
--
well
similar
to
playing
20
questions.
the
first
question
is
always,
is
it
animal,
vegetable,
or
mineral?
and
this
makes
a
gross
categorization
from
which
you
take
off,
and
we
feel
that
the
cultural
patterns
or
biological,
we
wouldn't
get
into
that
debate
i
trust,
for
some
reason
men
and
women
in
this
country
prefer
different
types
of
jobs
and
it
is
a
legitimate
newspaper
function
to
cater
to
these
differences
by
putting
the
ads
--
by
providing
different
columns
wherein
advertisers
can
place
these
ads.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
and
if
one
reads
the
record
and
the
allegations
of
the
original
complainants
in
this
case,
one
would
assume
that
these
are
just
placed
there
solely
for
the
purposes
of
invidious
discrimination
that
everybody
who
places
an
ad
for
a
secretary
is
seeking
to
discriminate
against
male
secretaries.
on
the
contrary,
i
think,
when
you
take
judicial
notice
in
fact
the
average
advertiser
is
merely
seeking
an
employee
and
the
idea
of
discrimination,
one
way
or
another
doesn't
come
into
his
mind.
he
is
looking
for
an
employee,
if
he
advertises
for
a
truck
driver,
the
odds
of
him
getting
a
female
truck
driver
are
relatively
limited,
no
matter
where
he
puts
the
ad.
therefore
it
is
even
for
the
reader,
a
service
which
permits
maximum
for
the
advertisers,
i
am
sorry
--
for
the
advertisers
it
is
a
service
which
permits
maximum
reader
response.
the
complainants
in
this
case
in
the
city
have
made
much
that
this
is
a
service
for
the
advertisers.
it
is
the
service
for
the
advertiser;
it
is
the
service
for
the
reader.
it
is
an
intention,
a
device
to
get
maximum
response
to
an
ad.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
job
seekers
are
neutered.
there
aren't
very
many
of
them
in
regard
to
number
and
they
are
merely
placed
in
the
'help
wanted'
situation
wanted
ad.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
they
do
that.
they
don't
feel
necessarily
that
they
are
compelled
to,
but
the
press
does
in
cooperation
with
the
pittsburgh
human
relation
commission
engaged
in
a
voluntary
screening
process
on
these
ads.
it's
part
of
our
contention
here
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
them
to
do
so,
that’s
also
the
contention
in
the
hunter
case
which
is
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
i
believe
the
city
would
attempt
to
get
her
to
dissuade
her
from
placing
it
because
of
their
agreement
with
the
human
relations
commission.
of
course
we
reject
all
kinds
of
ads,
i
just
got
involved
in
massage
parlors
recently
and
rejecting
ads
for
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
[laughter
attempt]
we
do
censor
ad
content
voluntarily
based
on
the
editorial
judgment
of
the
newspaper.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes
sir,
i
see
a
first
amendment
problem
enforcing
a
newspaper
to
do
it.
i
think
they
have
got
the
right
to
censor
it
if
they
wish,
but
i
see
a
first
amendment
problem
if
the
newspaper
wish
to
resist,
which
is
precisely
the
case
in
hunter
case
which
of
course
is
certainly
companion
to
this
one
in
which
petition
for
rehearing
on
certiorari
is
pending
before
this
court.
that
was
precisely
the
issue
there.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
does
our
case
hang
on
that?
our
case
hangs
on
two
points;
one
is
the
freedom
of
the
press
argument
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
if
valentine
survives
in
some
of
its
grosser
language,
its
simplistic
language,
if
no
distinctions
can
be
drawn,
we
may
very
well
lose.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
valentine,
as
i
am
sure
you
know
mr.
justice
white,
is
a
two
page
opinion.
the
circuit
court
i
believe
is
two
page,
it
could
be
three,
it's
very
short.
the
circuit
court
opinion
was
a
long
and
very
closely
reasoned
opinion
and
valentine
just,
as
mr.
douglas
said,
the
opinion
appears
casual
almost
offhand
and
yet
everybody
who
cited
it
for
authority
that
commercial
speech
deserves
no
protection,
has
no
first
amendment
rights.
this
has
been
repeated
so
often
in
the
authority
citing
valentine
that
we
find,
that
let's
say
inverted
pyramid.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
oh,
it
certainly
is,
so
there
is
the
editorial
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
you
could
by
deciding
--
unless
you
take
an
extremely
simplistic
view
of
valentine
which
is
to
say
if
it's
commercial,
it
has
no
protection.
i
think
you
have
already
said
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
that
merely
because
a
matter
is
commercial,
newspapers
are
bought
and
sold,
wages
are
paid,
money
changes
hands
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
it
was.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yeah,
it
was
a
political
advertisement.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
valentine
versus
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
i
am
contending
that
as
we
begin
to
balance
the
various
interests
here,
we
can
simply
say
that
just
because
it's
commercial
it
has
full
first
amendment
rights,
just
because
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
and
we
certainly
think
that
you
should.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
we
feel
that
the
help
wanted
arrangement,
we
have
two
points
on
that,
both
which
can
be
distinguished
from
valentine
unless
as
you
did
in
sullivan.
as
i
said
unless
you
would
take
an
extremely
rigid
view
of
valentine,
that
help
wanted
ads
is
editorial
comment.
it
is
a
statement,
the
way
we
arrange
them,
is
a
statement
of
the
editor's
opinion
as
to
how
best
service
the
readers
and
best
appeal
to
the
readers
just
the
way
he
arranges
his
paper
vis-à-vis
placing
of
the
television
section
vis-à-vis
the
placing
of
the
sports
pages
and
vis-à-vis
rear
editorial
pages
versus
the
front
page
where
the
average
reader
wouldn't
be
too
enthused.
to
buy
the
paper,
he
puts
in
the
middle.
one
may
make
a
social
commentary
that
maybe
it
could
be,
should
be
on
the
front
pages.
we
say,
how
he
arranges
the
newspaper
is
an
editorial
judgment
and
that
this
is
not
commercial.
and
secondly
if
it
is,
it
is
a
mixed
editorial
and
commercial
policy.
want-ads
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
answer
to
your
question
are
a
basic
community
service,
they
are
like
the
community
billboard,
and
we
feel
that
this
is
a
forum
that
should
be
intruded
upon
only
with
great
caution,
as
in
new
york
times
versus
the
sullivan.
i
think
it
falls
under
dr.
mitchell
john's
theory
of
governing
importance.
as
we
know
that
theory
is
an
extremely
broad
one,
governing
importance
is
merely
not
politics
as
quoted
in
harvard
law
review
in
their
main
article
on
deceptive
advertising,
mitchell
john's
concept
of
governing
interest
is
very
broad
indeed
including
those
forms
of
thought
and
expression
within
the
range
of
human
communication
from
which
the
voter
derives
the
knowledge,
intelligence,
sensitivity
values
required
to
sanely
and
objectively
judge
the
power
and
duty
of
self
government.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
that
argument
has
been
made
and
has
attractive
merit
until
we
realize
that
we
are
in
a
law
explosion
at
--
we
are
those
of
us
who
labor
in
this
venue
out
there
see
every
passage
of
every
new
act
of
congress,
we
have
new
guidelines,
new
regulations,
new
rules
that
are
imposed
upon
business
and
we
find
that
the
newspapers
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
well
i
would
think
that
business
has
some
protections
under
the
first
amendment
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
a
newspaper
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
well
i
think
the
plumbing
business,
if
he
places
a
commercial
advertisement
in
a
newspaper,
have
certain
first
amendment
rights
to
express
his
--
to
put
his
ad,
and
i
think
that’s
what
our
case
is,
to
some
degree,
all
about
that
the
commercial
context
does
not
totally
devoid
of
first
amendment
protection.
and
just
because
somebody
buys
it
or
sells
it
or
offers
a
commercial
product,
does
not
leave
him
to
tender
mercies
of
the
due
process
and
fifth
amendment
alone,
but
does
come
under
some
first
amendment
protection
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
i
think
to
balance
the
hazard
involved,
the
harm
to
be
remedy
with
the
right
to
be
expressed,
and
one
of
these
is
the
right
of
the
newspaper,
a
newspaper
--
i
shouldn't
face
that
way
of
course.
the
first
amendment
doesn't
make
it
all
freedom
of
the
speech,
it
mentions
the
press
separately.
it
says
freedom
of
a
speech
and
of
the
press,
the
press
has
been
a
peculiar
institution
in
this
country
since
the
days
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
john
peter
zenger
and
his
trail.
now,
the
press
is
a
major
complex
business
which
provides
a
basic
inter
flow
of
communications
and
ideas
and
one
of
them
is
want-ads
and
one
of
the
aspects
here
is
the
placement
of
those
want
ads
and
it
may
be
a
small
chip
as
we
say
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
it
as
the
lilliputians
tying
down
gulliver,
he
is
a
big
giant,
and
every
little
rope
that
they
put
across
him
no
bigger
than
a
sewing
thread
eventually
tied
him
to
the
earth
and
that’s
what
we
have
with
the
newspapers.
there
are
these
guidelines
proliferate
and
the
newspapers
become
the
enforcement
arm
of
agencies
seeking
to
produce
meritorious
or
not
meritorious,
we
don't
pass
judgment
on
that
here,
i
am
not
trying
to
readdress
the
ordinance
but
as
these
agencies
attempt
to
use
the
newspapers
of
the
country
as
enforcement
arms
as
they
have
here
and
as
they
did
in
hunter
making
them
a
screening
agency,
this
impinges
on
the
freedom
of
that
newspaper
to
control
its
pages
the
way
they
prefer.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
missed
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
in
the
pittsburgh
press?
mr.
charles
r.
volk
our
position
is
that
those
--
well
yeah,
that
was
the
voluntary
act
merely
by
committing
a
voluntary
cooperation
with
the
humans
relations
commission,
i
don't
think
it
obligates
us
to
take
the
whole
law
if
it
impinges
on
us
in
someway
we
wish
to
challenge
in
court.
the
pittsburgh
press
committee
decided
that
it
had
a
commitment
to
civil
rights
and
to
certain
social
change
and
did
indeed
work
with
the
city's
human
relations
commission
and
with
the
state
commission
on
the
content
of
ads,
but
it
did
not
do
so
under
compulsion
of
law
where
they
were
forced
to
do
something
which
they,
in
their
best
judgment,
did
not
think
was
proper,
they
fought
and
here
we
are.
now
i
say
that
we
can't
pick
and
choose
those
regulations
which
we
find
meritorious,
but
most
certainly
sir,
we
have
the
right
to
challenge
those
regulations
which
in
our
opinion
impinge
on
the
the
freedom
to
run
that
newspaper
in
an
efficient
manner
and
conducting
the
inter
flow
of
information
in
the
way
we
see
fit.
in
that
hunter
case
the
circuit
court
said
the
newspaper
has
no
problem
divining
the
intent
of
the
ads
that
it
publishes,
and
even
though
the
hud
guidelines
under
which
they
are
working
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
say
that
the
use
of
catch
words,
locations,
which
might
indicate
a
discriminatory
intent
in
housing
or
proscribed
in
the
newspaper
is
a
co-defendant
in
these
cases.
and
yet
the
circuit
court
says
the
newspaper
has
a
duty
to
divide
the
intent
of
those
ads
that
it
prints.
here
we
have
exceptions
to
this
ordinance.
the
commonwealth
court
has
found
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
cannot
regulate
the
want-ad
advertising
of
advertisers
outside
the
city
merely
because
the
paper
is
printed
there.
we
have
the
under-five
employment
exemption;
we
have
the
domestic
employment
exemption,
and
yet
we
have
to
guess
or
find
out
whether
the
employer
who
is
seeking
an
employee
fits
under
one
of
these
exemptions,
and
we
do
so
at
our
peril.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
no
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge.
we
used
to
have
a
barmaid
law
in
pennsylvania
but
that's
has
been
repealed.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
in
our
attitude,
we
could
take
the
ad
any
way
we
wanted
it.
the
city's
attitude
is
he
has
got
to
go
and
get
a
bona
fide
occupational
exemption
certificate
from
the
city
and
then
when
they
present
us
the
certificate,
we
can
print
it.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
oh,
i
wrote
it.
[laughter]
disclaimers
have
been
challenged
of
course
in
civil
rights
cases
for
a
long
time,
but
i
think
where
you
have
a
record
like
this
one
and
a
legitimate
body
of
desire
for
jobs,
i
think
you
can
legitimately
rely
to
some
degree
on
a
disclaimer.
it's
merely
not
a
guise.
we
say
too
that
in
publications
of
limited
interests
such
as
sports
magazine,
the
magazine
ms,
the
black
newspapers
that
we
have
in
most
of
our
urban
centers,
if
they
take
an
ad,
it
is,
in
essence,
an
expression
of
a
preference
for
the
limited
readers,
the
limited
group
of
readers
that
they
represent.
and
that
if
our
newspaper
can't
take
a
job,
put
an
ad
under
a
female
interest
column,
then
it
probably
couldn't
put
it
under
a
society
page,
and
we
seriously
doubt
if
you
extend
that
that
putting
it
in
a
special
interest
publication,
it
constitutes
expression
of
a
preference,
we
wonder
what
will
happen
to
the
fcc
regulations
and
affirmative
action
programs
that
forces
government
contractors
to
apply
or
to
advertise
for
jobs
in
black
newspapers,
the
spanish
speaking
newspapers
in
appropriate
areas
and
others,
because
those
are
definitely
an
expression
of
a
preference.
and
are
those
newspapers
to
be
placed
on
their
peril
to
be
sure
that
the
advertiser
also
advertises
some
place
else
to
get
a
wide
range
or
body
of
response
to
the
ad.
judge
crumlish
of
commonwealth
court
addressed
himself
to
that
very
point.
he
mentioned
i
believe
ms.
magazine
and
ebony
when
he
discussed,
are
we
to
really
get
in
censor
by
making
them
aiders,
which
is
what
we
were
accused
of
and
found
guilty
of
here
being
an
aider
in
discrimination,
merely
because
the
ku
klux
klan
journal
runs
a
--
if
they
have
such
a
thing,
runs
a
want-ad
section
and
i
think
that
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
if
an
employer
placed
the
want-ad
or
an
employee
in
ku
klux
klan
journal,
he
is
not
likely
to
get
too
many
employees
who
were
not
white
anglo-saxon
protestants,
and
probably
southern.
i
think
we
find
that
the
newspapers
are
being
impinged
on
with
some
significant
degree
and
as
one
court
said
this
maybe
an
idea
whose
time
has
come
but
we
ask
that
it
should
be
let
come
through
the
free
interchange
of
ideas
and
through
the
interchange
of
advertisers
and
readers
and
through
cultural
change,
if
it
will,
but
it
not
come
through
government
fiat
and
the
cultural
predilections
of
local
special
interest
groups
or
government
officials.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
i
don't
think
i
will
need
that
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
strassburger
said
something
i
think
needs
to
be
corrected.
when
he
pointed
out
that
the
press
is
not
called
to
do
any
screening;
this
is
an
error
which
was
picked
up
by
the
appellate
division
courts
of
new
york
in
national
organization
for
women
versus
the
states
division
of
human
right,
which
was
just
reported
in
the
cch
employment
practices
decisions
service,
wherein
they
distinguished
the
pittsburgh
press
case
in
one
of
their
own
where
they
did
not
permit
a
court
to
bar
the
the
--
that
was
a
rule
in
our
way
in
this
particular
given
fact
situation.
they
permitted
the
sex
segregated
want-ads
to
continue.
they
distinguished
the
pittsburgh
press
case
in
that
the
pittsburgh
press
had
a
ready
screening
device
with
this
certificate,
but
that
only
applies
to
the
one
exemption;
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
exemption.
the
ordinance
also
excludes
domestics
and
it
excludes
people
who
do
not
live
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
by
commonwealth
court
order
and
it
excludes
employers
of
less
than
five,
so
that
the
press
would
still
have
thrust
upon
it
the
burden
of
screening
out
these
other
criteria.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
no,
i
don't
think
so.
pennsylvania
has
an
equal
rights
amendment
to
its
own
constitution
and
i
apprehend
the
constitution
as
it
reached
today
to
provide
equal
protection
to
women.
i
don't
hold
myself
out
as
a
major
constitutional
scholar,
but
i
have
personal
difficulty
in
seeing
any
rights
to
be
granted
to
women
by
the
equal
rights
amendment
that
they
don't
already
have
by
our
own
glorious
document
that
had
served
us
so
well
for
so
many
years.
i
think
they
have
all
the
rights
that
anybody
else
has.
and
the
only
other
one
point
i
wanted
to
point
out
is
that
mrs.
matson
indicates
that
the
pittsburgh
press
is,
in
essence,
acting
as
a
discourager
of
women.
actually
this
is
not
the
case,
the
pittsburgh
press
is
not
attempting
to
keep
women
in
its
place,
whatever
that
maybe
and
i
think
that's
a
ratio
up
that's
calculated
to
cause
certain
emotional
reactions
in
the
justices.
pittsburgh
press
is
not
engaged
in
any
such
action
at
all.
the
pittsburgh
press
just
simply
wants
to
reflect
in
its
want-ads
the
statuses
that
exists
in
job
preferences,
and
whether
the
national
organization
for
women
likes
it
or
not,
they
do
not
wish
to
be
conscripted
as
unwilling
janissaries
in
the
fight
for
social
change
as
the
national
organization
for
women
foresee
it.
thank
you
gentleman.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
pittsburgh
press
company
has,
as
most
newspapers
in
the
country
did
have,
a
system
and
still
do,
i
might
add,
a
system
of
classifying
its
'help
wanted'
advertisements
under
either
male
or
female.
some
time
after
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
after
eeoc
guidelines
which
indicated
that
male
and
female
as
such
might
be
proscribed
and
after
the
eeoc
promulgated
some
alternative
guidelines
which
have
since
been
overturned
again
by
the
eeoc
in
one
of
their
changes
of
guidelines,
the
pittsburgh
press
went
to
a
system
of
male
interest
and
female
interest
in
a
third
column
heading
male-female.
appropriately
and
prominently
displayed
in
the
want-ads
themselves
at
the
heads
of
the
columns
were
a
rather
large
disclaimer
box
entitled
"notice
to
job
seekers"
which
pointed
out
that
the
classification
was
for
reader
interest
only,
and
should
not
be
construed
as
being
a
limitation
since
most
laws
--
there
were
laws
in
most
jurisdictions
which
proscribed
discrimination
on
the
basis
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
as
to
which
column
each
ad
went
in?
the
record
is
fairly
complete
on
that
mr.
justice
white.
the
system
is
that
the
advertiser
calls
up
and
in
essence
says
where
he
wants
it.
if
he
does
not
express
preference
for
placement
of
the
ad,
the
newspaper
will
help
him
where
most
ads
of
this
type
'secretaries
female',
'truck
driver
male'
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yeah
the
newspaper
will
help.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
it
makes
the
final
--
it
reserves
for
itself
the
final
determination,
but
i
would
be
fatuous
and
untrue
if
i
told
this
court
that
that's
the
way
it
happens
in
actual
practice.
in
actual
practice
the
advertiser
who
is
seeking
an
employee
calls
up
and
says
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
yes
sir
that’s
essentially
the
way
it
works.
and
now
we
have
male
interest
and
female
interest.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
passed
an
ordinance
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
it
isn't
its
judgment
in
any
specific
case.
i
would
be
fatuous
if
i
say
that.
however,
we
do
contend
that
the
newspaper
gets
into
the
act
by
making
an
editorial
decision
that
there
are
jobs,
there
is
a
large
body
of
differing
interest
between
males
and
females
as
they
relate
to
the
job
market,
and
it
is
the
decision
of
the
newspaper
to
run
column
headings
appealing
to
this
reader
interest
and
permitting
advertisers
to
place
job
in
there.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes
they
would.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
not
on
the
record.
there
could
be
oportunity
--
there
could
be,
of
course,
occasions
where
the
newspaper
would
nudge
it
into
one
or
refuse
to
carry,
refuse
to
carry
perhaps
a
go-go
dancer
in
the
male
section,
but
we
can
search
throughout
the
record
and
not
find
any
reference
to
that.
i
don't
believe
sir,
we
read
the
record
very
carefully
prior
to
this
hearing.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
absolutely
sir
that's
why
we
are
here.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
it
is
the
very
strongly
held
opinion,
scripps-howard
newspapers
who
have
the
controlling
interest
in
the
pittsburgh
press
and
in
the
pittsburgh
press
that
this
does
serve
a
legitimate
reader
and
advertiser
function
in
providing
a
--
well
similar
to
playing
20
questions.
the
first
question
is
always,
is
it
animal,
vegetable,
or
mineral?
and
this
makes
a
gross
categorization
from
which
you
take
off,
and
we
feel
that
the
cultural
patterns
or
biological,
we
wouldn't
get
into
that
debate
i
trust,
for
some
reason
men
and
women
in
this
country
prefer
different
types
of
jobs
and
it
is
a
legitimate
newspaper
function
to
cater
to
these
differences
by
putting
the
ads
--
by
providing
different
columns
wherein
advertisers
can
place
these
ads.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
and
if
one
reads
the
record
and
the
allegations
of
the
original
complainants
in
this
case,
one
would
assume
that
these
are
just
placed
there
solely
for
the
purposes
of
invidious
discrimination
that
everybody
who
places
an
ad
for
a
secretary
is
seeking
to
discriminate
against
male
secretaries.
on
the
contrary,
i
think,
when
you
take
judicial
notice
in
fact
the
average
advertiser
is
merely
seeking
an
employee
and
the
idea
of
discrimination,
one
way
or
another
doesn't
come
into
his
mind.
he
is
looking
for
an
employee,
if
he
advertises
for
a
truck
driver,
the
odds
of
him
getting
a
female
truck
driver
are
relatively
limited,
no
matter
where
he
puts
the
ad.
therefore
it
is
even
for
the
reader,
a
service
which
permits
maximum
for
the
advertisers,
i
am
sorry
--
for
the
advertisers
it
is
a
service
which
permits
maximum
reader
response.
the
complainants
in
this
case
in
the
city
have
made
much
that
this
is
a
service
for
the
advertisers.
it
is
the
service
for
the
advertiser;
it
is
the
service
for
the
reader.
it
is
an
intention,
a
device
to
get
maximum
response
to
an
ad.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
job
seekers
are
neutered.
there
aren't
very
many
of
them
in
regard
to
number
and
they
are
merely
placed
in
the
'help
wanted'
situation
wanted
ad.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
they
do
that.
they
don't
feel
necessarily
that
they
are
compelled
to,
but
the
press
does
in
cooperation
with
the
pittsburgh
human
relation
commission
engaged
in
a
voluntary
screening
process
on
these
ads.
it's
part
of
our
contention
here
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
them
to
do
so,
that’s
also
the
contention
in
the
hunter
case
which
is
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
i
believe
the
city
would
attempt
to
get
her
to
dissuade
her
from
placing
it
because
of
their
agreement
with
the
human
relations
commission.
of
course
we
reject
all
kinds
of
ads,
i
just
got
involved
in
massage
parlors
recently
and
rejecting
ads
for
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
[laughter
attempt]
we
do
censor
ad
content
voluntarily
based
on
the
editorial
judgment
of
the
newspaper.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes
sir,
i
see
a
first
amendment
problem
enforcing
a
newspaper
to
do
it.
i
think
they
have
got
the
right
to
censor
it
if
they
wish,
but
i
see
a
first
amendment
problem
if
the
newspaper
wish
to
resist,
which
is
precisely
the
case
in
hunter
case
which
of
course
is
certainly
companion
to
this
one
in
which
petition
for
rehearing
on
certiorari
is
pending
before
this
court.
that
was
precisely
the
issue
there.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
does
our
case
hang
on
that?
our
case
hangs
on
two
points;
one
is
the
freedom
of
the
press
argument
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
if
valentine
survives
in
some
of
its
grosser
language,
its
simplistic
language,
if
no
distinctions
can
be
drawn,
we
may
very
well
lose.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
valentine,
as
i
am
sure
you
know
mr.
justice
white,
is
a
two
page
opinion.
the
circuit
court
i
believe
is
two
page,
it
could
be
three,
it's
very
short.
the
circuit
court
opinion
was
a
long
and
very
closely
reasoned
opinion
and
valentine
just,
as
mr.
douglas
said,
the
opinion
appears
casual
almost
offhand
and
yet
everybody
who
cited
it
for
authority
that
commercial
speech
deserves
no
protection,
has
no
first
amendment
rights.
this
has
been
repeated
so
often
in
the
authority
citing
valentine
that
we
find,
that
let's
say
inverted
pyramid.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
oh,
it
certainly
is,
so
there
is
the
editorial
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
you
could
by
deciding
--
unless
you
take
an
extremely
simplistic
view
of
valentine
which
is
to
say
if
it's
commercial,
it
has
no
protection.
i
think
you
have
already
said
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
that
merely
because
a
matter
is
commercial,
newspapers
are
bought
and
sold,
wages
are
paid,
money
changes
hands
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes,
it
was.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yeah,
it
was
a
political
advertisement.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
valentine
versus
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
i
am
contending
that
as
we
begin
to
balance
the
various
interests
here,
we
can
simply
say
that
just
because
it's
commercial
it
has
full
first
amendment
rights,
just
because
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
and
we
certainly
think
that
you
should.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
we
feel
that
the
help
wanted
arrangement,
we
have
two
points
on
that,
both
which
can
be
distinguished
from
valentine
unless
as
you
did
in
sullivan.
as
i
said
unless
you
would
take
an
extremely
rigid
view
of
valentine,
that
help
wanted
ads
is
editorial
comment.
it
is
a
statement,
the
way
we
arrange
them,
is
a
statement
of
the
editor's
opinion
as
to
how
best
service
the
readers
and
best
appeal
to
the
readers
just
the
way
he
arranges
his
paper
vis-à-vis
placing
of
the
television
section
vis-à-vis
the
placing
of
the
sports
pages
and
vis-à-vis
rear
editorial
pages
versus
the
front
page
where
the
average
reader
wouldn't
be
too
enthused.
to
buy
the
paper,
he
puts
in
the
middle.
one
may
make
a
social
commentary
that
maybe
it
could
be,
should
be
on
the
front
pages.
we
say,
how
he
arranges
the
newspaper
is
an
editorial
judgment
and
that
this
is
not
commercial.
and
secondly
if
it
is,
it
is
a
mixed
editorial
and
commercial
policy.
want-ads
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
answer
to
your
question
are
a
basic
community
service,
they
are
like
the
community
billboard,
and
we
feel
that
this
is
a
forum
that
should
be
intruded
upon
only
with
great
caution,
as
in
new
york
times
versus
the
sullivan.
i
think
it
falls
under
dr.
mitchell
john's
theory
of
governing
importance.
as
we
know
that
theory
is
an
extremely
broad
one,
governing
importance
is
merely
not
politics
as
quoted
in
harvard
law
review
in
their
main
article
on
deceptive
advertising,
mitchell
john's
concept
of
governing
interest
is
very
broad
indeed
including
those
forms
of
thought
and
expression
within
the
range
of
human
communication
from
which
the
voter
derives
the
knowledge,
intelligence,
sensitivity
values
required
to
sanely
and
objectively
judge
the
power
and
duty
of
self
government.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
that
argument
has
been
made
and
has
attractive
merit
until
we
realize
that
we
are
in
a
law
explosion
at
--
we
are
those
of
us
who
labor
in
this
venue
out
there
see
every
passage
of
every
new
act
of
congress,
we
have
new
guidelines,
new
regulations,
new
rules
that
are
imposed
upon
business
and
we
find
that
the
newspapers
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
well
i
would
think
that
business
has
some
protections
under
the
first
amendment
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
a
newspaper
--
mr.
charles
r.
volk
well
i
think
the
plumbing
business,
if
he
places
a
commercial
advertisement
in
a
newspaper,
have
certain
first
amendment
rights
to
express
his
--
to
put
his
ad,
and
i
think
that’s
what
our
case
is,
to
some
degree,
all
about
that
the
commercial
context
does
not
totally
devoid
of
first
amendment
protection.
and
just
because
somebody
buys
it
or
sells
it
or
offers
a
commercial
product,
does
not
leave
him
to
tender
mercies
of
the
due
process
and
fifth
amendment
alone,
but
does
come
under
some
first
amendment
protection
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
i
think
to
balance
the
hazard
involved,
the
harm
to
be
remedy
with
the
right
to
be
expressed,
and
one
of
these
is
the
right
of
the
newspaper,
a
newspaper
--
i
shouldn't
face
that
way
of
course.
the
first
amendment
doesn't
make
it
all
freedom
of
the
speech,
it
mentions
the
press
separately.
it
says
freedom
of
a
speech
and
of
the
press,
the
press
has
been
a
peculiar
institution
in
this
country
since
the
days
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
john
peter
zenger
and
his
trail.
now,
the
press
is
a
major
complex
business
which
provides
a
basic
inter
flow
of
communications
and
ideas
and
one
of
them
is
want-ads
and
one
of
the
aspects
here
is
the
placement
of
those
want
ads
and
it
may
be
a
small
chip
as
we
say
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
it
as
the
lilliputians
tying
down
gulliver,
he
is
a
big
giant,
and
every
little
rope
that
they
put
across
him
no
bigger
than
a
sewing
thread
eventually
tied
him
to
the
earth
and
that’s
what
we
have
with
the
newspapers.
there
are
these
guidelines
proliferate
and
the
newspapers
become
the
enforcement
arm
of
agencies
seeking
to
produce
meritorious
or
not
meritorious,
we
don't
pass
judgment
on
that
here,
i
am
not
trying
to
readdress
the
ordinance
but
as
these
agencies
attempt
to
use
the
newspapers
of
the
country
as
enforcement
arms
as
they
have
here
and
as
they
did
in
hunter
making
them
a
screening
agency,
this
impinges
on
the
freedom
of
that
newspaper
to
control
its
pages
the
way
they
prefer.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
missed
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
in
the
pittsburgh
press?
mr.
charles
r.
volk
our
position
is
that
those
--
well
yeah,
that
was
the
voluntary
act
merely
by
committing
a
voluntary
cooperation
with
the
humans
relations
commission,
i
don't
think
it
obligates
us
to
take
the
whole
law
if
it
impinges
on
us
in
someway
we
wish
to
challenge
in
court.
the
pittsburgh
press
committee
decided
that
it
had
a
commitment
to
civil
rights
and
to
certain
social
change
and
did
indeed
work
with
the
city's
human
relations
commission
and
with
the
state
commission
on
the
content
of
ads,
but
it
did
not
do
so
under
compulsion
of
law
where
they
were
forced
to
do
something
which
they,
in
their
best
judgment,
did
not
think
was
proper,
they
fought
and
here
we
are.
now
i
say
that
we
can't
pick
and
choose
those
regulations
which
we
find
meritorious,
but
most
certainly
sir,
we
have
the
right
to
challenge
those
regulations
which
in
our
opinion
impinge
on
the
the
freedom
to
run
that
newspaper
in
an
efficient
manner
and
conducting
the
inter
flow
of
information
in
the
way
we
see
fit.
in
that
hunter
case
the
circuit
court
said
the
newspaper
has
no
problem
divining
the
intent
of
the
ads
that
it
publishes,
and
even
though
the
hud
guidelines
under
which
they
are
working
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
say
that
the
use
of
catch
words,
locations,
which
might
indicate
a
discriminatory
intent
in
housing
or
proscribed
in
the
newspaper
is
a
co-defendant
in
these
cases.
and
yet
the
circuit
court
says
the
newspaper
has
a
duty
to
divide
the
intent
of
those
ads
that
it
prints.
here
we
have
exceptions
to
this
ordinance.
the
commonwealth
court
has
found
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
cannot
regulate
the
want-ad
advertising
of
advertisers
outside
the
city
merely
because
the
paper
is
printed
there.
we
have
the
under-five
employment
exemption;
we
have
the
domestic
employment
exemption,
and
yet
we
have
to
guess
or
find
out
whether
the
employer
who
is
seeking
an
employee
fits
under
one
of
these
exemptions,
and
we
do
so
at
our
peril.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
no
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge.
we
used
to
have
a
barmaid
law
in
pennsylvania
but
that's
has
been
repealed.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
in
our
attitude,
we
could
take
the
ad
any
way
we
wanted
it.
the
city's
attitude
is
he
has
got
to
go
and
get
a
bona
fide
occupational
exemption
certificate
from
the
city
and
then
when
they
present
us
the
certificate,
we
can
print
it.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
oh,
i
wrote
it.
[laughter]
disclaimers
have
been
challenged
of
course
in
civil
rights
cases
for
a
long
time,
but
i
think
where
you
have
a
record
like
this
one
and
a
legitimate
body
of
desire
for
jobs,
i
think
you
can
legitimately
rely
to
some
degree
on
a
disclaimer.
it's
merely
not
a
guise.
we
say
too
that
in
publications
of
limited
interests
such
as
sports
magazine,
the
magazine
ms,
the
black
newspapers
that
we
have
in
most
of
our
urban
centers,
if
they
take
an
ad,
it
is,
in
essence,
an
expression
of
a
preference
for
the
limited
readers,
the
limited
group
of
readers
that
they
represent.
and
that
if
our
newspaper
can't
take
a
job,
put
an
ad
under
a
female
interest
column,
then
it
probably
couldn't
put
it
under
a
society
page,
and
we
seriously
doubt
if
you
extend
that
that
putting
it
in
a
special
interest
publication,
it
constitutes
expression
of
a
preference,
we
wonder
what
will
happen
to
the
fcc
regulations
and
affirmative
action
programs
that
forces
government
contractors
to
apply
or
to
advertise
for
jobs
in
black
newspapers,
the
spanish
speaking
newspapers
in
appropriate
areas
and
others,
because
those
are
definitely
an
expression
of
a
preference.
and
are
those
newspapers
to
be
placed
on
their
peril
to
be
sure
that
the
advertiser
also
advertises
some
place
else
to
get
a
wide
range
or
body
of
response
to
the
ad.
judge
crumlish
of
commonwealth
court
addressed
himself
to
that
very
point.
he
mentioned
i
believe
ms.
magazine
and
ebony
when
he
discussed,
are
we
to
really
get
in
censor
by
making
them
aiders,
which
is
what
we
were
accused
of
and
found
guilty
of
here
being
an
aider
in
discrimination,
merely
because
the
ku
klux
klan
journal
runs
a
--
if
they
have
such
a
thing,
runs
a
want-ad
section
and
i
think
that
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
if
an
employer
placed
the
want-ad
or
an
employee
in
ku
klux
klan
journal,
he
is
not
likely
to
get
too
many
employees
who
were
not
white
anglo-saxon
protestants,
and
probably
southern.
i
think
we
find
that
the
newspapers
are
being
impinged
on
with
some
significant
degree
and
as
one
court
said
this
maybe
an
idea
whose
time
has
come
but
we
ask
that
it
should
be
let
come
through
the
free
interchange
of
ideas
and
through
the
interchange
of
advertisers
and
readers
and
through
cultural
change,
if
it
will,
but
it
not
come
through
government
fiat
and
the
cultural
predilections
of
local
special
interest
groups
or
government
officials.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
i
don't
think
i
will
need
that
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
strassburger
said
something
i
think
needs
to
be
corrected.
when
he
pointed
out
that
the
press
is
not
called
to
do
any
screening;
this
is
an
error
which
was
picked
up
by
the
appellate
division
courts
of
new
york
in
national
organization
for
women
versus
the
states
division
of
human
right,
which
was
just
reported
in
the
cch
employment
practices
decisions
service,
wherein
they
distinguished
the
pittsburgh
press
case
in
one
of
their
own
where
they
did
not
permit
a
court
to
bar
the
the
--
that
was
a
rule
in
our
way
in
this
particular
given
fact
situation.
they
permitted
the
sex
segregated
want-ads
to
continue.
they
distinguished
the
pittsburgh
press
case
in
that
the
pittsburgh
press
had
a
ready
screening
device
with
this
certificate,
but
that
only
applies
to
the
one
exemption;
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
exemption.
the
ordinance
also
excludes
domestics
and
it
excludes
people
who
do
not
live
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
by
commonwealth
court
order
and
it
excludes
employers
of
less
than
five,
so
that
the
press
would
still
have
thrust
upon
it
the
burden
of
screening
out
these
other
criteria.
mr.
charles
r.
volk
no,
i
don't
think
so.
pennsylvania
has
an
equal
rights
amendment
to
its
own
constitution
and
i
apprehend
the
constitution
as
it
reached
today
to
provide
equal
protection
to
women.
i
don't
hold
myself
out
as
a
major
constitutional
scholar,
but
i
have
personal
difficulty
in
seeing
any
rights
to
be
granted
to
women
by
the
equal
rights
amendment
that
they
don't
already
have
by
our
own
glorious
document
that
had
served
us
so
well
for
so
many
years.
i
think
they
have
all
the
rights
that
anybody
else
has.
and
the
only
other
one
point
i
wanted
to
point
out
is
that
mrs.
matson
indicates
that
the
pittsburgh
press
is,
in
essence,
acting
as
a
discourager
of
women.
actually
this
is
not
the
case,
the
pittsburgh
press
is
not
attempting
to
keep
women
in
its
place,
whatever
that
maybe
and
i
think
that's
a
ratio
up
that's
calculated
to
cause
certain
emotional
reactions
in
the
justices.
pittsburgh
press
is
not
engaged
in
any
such
action
at
all.
the
pittsburgh
press
just
simply
wants
to
reflect
in
its
want-ads
the
statuses
that
exists
in
job
preferences,
and
whether
the
national
organization
for
women
likes
it
or
not,
they
do
not
wish
to
be
conscripted
as
unwilling
janissaries
in
the
fight
for
social
change
as
the
national
organization
for
women
foresee
it.
thank
you
gentleman.
