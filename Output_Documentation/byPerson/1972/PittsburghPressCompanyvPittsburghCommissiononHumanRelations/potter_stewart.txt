is
there
a
--
again
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
there
any
question
about
what
the
decision
to
set
up
the
classified
ads,
the
help
wanted
ads,
under
this
format
was
exclusively
the
decision
of
your
client,
the
newspaper.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
now
these
were
all
ads
for
'help
wanted'.
how
about
ads
for
positions
wanted,
jobs
wanted,
that
is
job
seekers
advertisers?
justice
potter
stewart
all
are
just
neutered
indiscriminately?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
surely
the
chief
justice’s
question
--
if
it
is
a
middle
aged
woman
who
wants
a
job,
doesn't
she
--
and
she
wants
to
say
she
is
a
middle
aged
woman
who
wants
a
job,
you
wouldn't
reject
her
ad
because
of
that,
because
she
didn’t
say
she
was
a
man.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
different
subject.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
newspaper
has
in
setting
up
this
setup
on
its
help
wanted
pages
given
advanced
thought
to
the
proposition
that
some
jobs
maybe
of
more
interest
to
women
and
other
jobs
of
more
interest
to
men.
it
has
given
thought
to
the
basic
idea
and
has
conceptualize
that
idea
in
the
setup
of
its
classified
advertising,
hasn't
it?
and
that
was
the
newspaper
decision,
at
least
that's
what
counsel
answered
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that
doesn't
involve
--
perhaps
you
are
quite
right.
but
you
don't
--
you
are
not
contending
here,
that
it's
the
advertisers
who
have
forced
the
newspaper
to
do
this
or
have
persuaded
the
newspaper
to
do
this
or
that
it's
the
advertiser's
idea
for
the
newspaper
to
set
it
up
this
way,
are
you,
because
i
have
understood
the
facts
otherwise?
justice
potter
stewart
did
that
case
involve
a
newspaper?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
big
difference
here.
i
mean
that's
at
least
one
of
the
two
issues
here,
is
the
first
amendment
and
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
airline
companies.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
they
want
to
speak.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
one
thing.
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
one
thing,
it
would
occur
to
me,
to
prohibit
an
employer
from
discriminating
in
his
hiring
policies
as
among
races
or
sexes
or
anything
else
and
also
to
prohibit
him
from
advertising
that
would
indicate
any
discrimination,
but
that's
quite
another
thing
from
the
government
putting
a
restriction
on
a
newspaper
as
to
what
it
can
print.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
case
didn't
either
involve
a
government
telling
a
newspaper
what
it
could
and
could
not
put
in
its
newspaper.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
conduct?
