mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
city
of
pittsburgh
and
it's
human
relations
commission.
the
commission
like
the
eeoc
and
similar
commissions
in
other
states,
many
of
which
are
represented
by
amicus
briefs
here
today
was
created
in
an
attempt
to
eliminate
discrimination
including
employment
discrimination.
a
1969
amendment
to
the
human
relation
ordinance
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
added
a
prohibition
on
the
basis
of
sex
to
the
other
prohibitions
on
race,
religion,
national
origin
grounds.
the
relevant
section
of
the
ordinance
for
our
purposes
is
section
8,
section
8
(e)
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
publish
or
cause
to
be
published
an
advertisement
indication
any
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
section
8
(j)
prohibits
any
person,
which
is
defined
so
as
to
include
a
newspaper
from
aiding
or
participating
in
the
doing
of
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
the
national
organization
for
women
filed
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
press
had
violated
section
8(j)
in
permitting
advertisers
to
advertise
in
these
sex
segregated
columns.
the
commission,
after
a
hearing
and
then
the
common
pleas
court
and
the
commonwealth
courts
of
pennsylvania
held
that
there
were
violations
of
the
ordinance
and
that
no
constitutional
rights
of
petitioner
had
been
abridged.
there
are
two
constitutional
questions
raised
here:
first
amendment
question,
which
i
will
deal
with
and
the
due
process
question,
which
counsel
for
the
national
organization
for
women
will
discuss.
respondents
believe
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
violation
in
this
case.
this
court
has
continually
held
that
constitutionally
protected
speech
is
less
than
absolute
and
the
courts
have
pointed
out
several
ways.
justice
harlan
in
the
konigsberg
case
mentioned
two.
first,
he
said
that
speech
in
certain
context
do
not
have
first
amendment
protection,
and
secondly
he
said
that
general
regulatory
statutes
not
intended
to
control
the
content
of
speech,
but
incidentally,
limiting
its
unfettered
exercise
were
permissible
so
long
as
the
laws
were
justified
by
an
important
governmental
interest.
i
think
that
to
these
two
limitations
we
can
add
a
third,
which
may
just
be
a
subcategory
of
the
second
and
that
is
that
conduct,
even
where
there
are
some
idea
associated
with
it,
does
not
have
the
first
amendment
protection
that
pure
speech
has.
the
petitioners'
activity
in
this
case
we
believe
fails
to
qualify
for
first
amendment
protection
on
not
just
one
of
these
basis,
but
on
all
three.
first
of
all
it's
commercial
speech
and
this
is
one
of
the
context
where
this
court
has
held
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply.
began
in
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
valentine
against
chrestensen
in
316
u.s.,
where
the
court
said
that
while
freedom
of
communicating
information
of
course
enjoys
a
high
degree
of
protection,
the
constitution
imposes
no
such
restrain
on
government
as
respects
purely
commercial
advertising.
we
believe
that
valentine
is
good
law
today;
it's
been
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
in
many
cases
which
we
point
in
our
brief,
and
it's
been
cited
with
approval
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
which
we
find
very
surprising
that
the
petitioner
relies
on.
that
was
a
political
advertisement
in
that
case.
it
recited
grievances,
it
protested
claimed
abuses,
it
expressed
opinion
and
the
court
was
very
careful
to
distinguish
that
political
advertisement
from
the
commercial
advertisement
in
valentine
against
chrestensen.
and
i
think
that
new
york
times,
the
political
advertisement
there,
can
be
distinguished
from
the
advertisements
involved
in
this
case
on
the
same
basis.
this
non-protection
of
commercial
speech,
we
believe,
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense.
professor
emerson
has
rationalized
it
as
applying
--
commercial
speech
applying
to
a
separate
sector
of
economic
activity,
an
area
that
involves
economic
interest
rather
than
the
interest
of
free
expression,
the
production
of
goods
and
services.
the
terms
that
this
court
used
in
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire,
we
are
not
dealing
with
any
essential
part
of
exposition
of
ideas.
i,
again,
find
it
surprising
that
petitioner
would
rely
on
the
meiklejohn
view
of
first
amendment
applying
to
governing
speech,
because
we
feel
that
that's
a
situation
where,
his
theory
says
that
public
affairs,
speech
that
has
to
do
with
public
affairs,
is
protected.
and
i
think
that
this
court
indicated
in
new
york
times
that
it
was
endorsing
the
meiklejohn
theory
when
it
distinguished
between
public
liable
and
private
liable.
it
would
seem
to
me
fairly
obvious
that
this
case
falls
on
the
private
side
of
the
public-private
dichotomy.
the
petitioner's
answer
to
this
as
well
the
advertisements
themselves
may
not
be
ideas,
but
the
column
headings
are
ideas,
they
are
different;
they
are
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
luncheon
break,
i
was
indicating
that
these
commercial
advertisements
are
non-ideas
and
the
petitioners'
response
to
this
is
to
say
that
the
ads
themselves
may
not
be
ideas,
but
that
the
column
headings
are
different,
that
they
are
abbreviated
editorial
comment
that
certain
jobs
are
of
more
interest
to
men
than
to
women.
however,
this
argument
corresponds
neither
to
the
facts,
nor
the
law.
in
answer
to
the
question
that
justice
white
asked,
the
paper
does
not
give
the
slightest
thought
to
whether
the
advertised
job
interest
men
or
women;
it
goes
wherever
the
advertiser
wants
the
ad
to
go,
regardless
of
whether
the
newspaper
might
have
thought
that
this
is
a
female
type
job
or
a
male
type
job.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
your
honor
i
don't
think
that
this
is
anymore
an
idea
than
to
say
that
a
violator
of
the
antitrust
law
says
that
well,
his
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
shows
his
idea
that
monopoly
is
beneficial
to
society.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
completely
disagree
with
the
answer
that
mr.
volk
gave.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well
first
of
all
it's
not
covered
by
the
ordinance.
we
are
talking
about
help
wanted
and
not
jobs
wanted.
the
advertise
--
the
ordinance
speaks
of
an
employer,
an
employment
agency
or
a
labor
union,
placing
an
add
indicating
discrimination.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
he
can
do
that,
because
number
one,
he
is
not
covered
by
the
ordinance
either,
because
the
ordinance
excludes
situations
of
five
or
a
fewer
employees.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
if
the
job
is
certified
as
a
bona
fide
--
as
having
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
then
either
an
employer
or
an
employment
agency
can
place
this
type
of
ad.
this
is
why
the
screening
argument
that
the
petitioner
makes
is
a
complete
red
herring
in
this
case.
there
is
no
screening
argument
even
if
this
were
a
situation
where
the
speech
allegedly
being
chilled
as
in
smith
against
california
were
protected
speech;
there
wouldn't
be
any
screening
argument,
because
it's
perfectly
clear
to
the
newspaper,
whether
this
job
has
a
bona
fide
occupation
qualification.
it
doesn't
have
to
guess
whether
there
is
a
bfoq
for
this
job.
section
7
(d)
of
our
ordinance
as
well
as
a
parallel
provision
in
the
state
ordinance
provides
that
if
there
is
a
--
if
the
employer
wants
a
bona
fide
occupation
exemption,
it
can
apply
to
the
commission
and
get
that
exemption.
so
there
is
no
problem
in
your
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
certainly
there
is
a
judgment
involved.
there
is
a
judgment
involved
in
all
of
these
commissions
as
to
whether
a
job
cannot
be
performed
by
a
male
or
cannot
be
performed
by
a
woman.
perhaps,
the
exemption
is
somewhat
broader
than
that,
for
instance,
a
man
probably,
could
be
a
lingerie
salesman,
but
probably
it
would
qualify
here
for
a
bona
fide
occupation
qualification
under
our
present
situation.
this
type
of
job
has
been
granted
a
bfoq,
even
though
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
that
shouldn't
qualify.
i
don't
know
what
the
commission
would
necessarily
do
with
that
sort
of
case,
but
as
far
as
the
pittsburgh
press
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
have
any
problem
as
far
as
screening
these
advertisements.
it
knows
because
there
either
is
an
exemption
or
there
isn't.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
employer
--
the
advertiser,
whomever
that
maybe.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
paper
doesn't
consider
whether
this
is
a
job
that
interest
men
and
women,
even
if
this
setup
were
created
so
as
to
cater
to
the
reader
preference,
that
would
not
excuse
this
violation
of
the
act
and
the
circuit
courts
have
so
held
in
the
diaz
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
involving
a
stewardess.
the
employer
argue,
well
my
customers
prefer
women
as
performing
this
job
on
airplanes,
and
the
court
says
that
doesn't
excuse
discrimination
what
your
customers
prefer
and
even
if
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
no
your
honor,
it
didn't.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
our
first
contention
is
that
these
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
--
that
these
are
non-ideas
and
these
headings
can't
raise
non-ideas
to
the
level
of
ideas.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
statute,
this
ordinance
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
not
an
unusual
statute.
there
are
--
i
think
a
holding
in
this
case
that
the
first
amendment
was
violated,
would
inferentially
overturn
many,
many
other
statutes,
all
of
which
have
been
sustained
by
the
courts
on
first
amendment
grounds;
for
instance,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which
was
held
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
hayes
case
to
prohibit
an
employer
from
placing
a
want
ad
in
a
sex
segregated
column.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
alright,
most
of
them
have,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
in-advance
a
argument
is
concerned,
this
court
and
other
courts
have
held
that
the
prior-restrain
argument
does
not
apply
where
the
speech
is
not
fully
protected.
for
instance,
in
the
lorain
journal
case
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
necessarily.
first
of
all,
we
feel
that
this
falls
directly
within
valentine
against
chrestensen.
the
case
is
interpreting
the
64
civil
rights
act,
the
68
civil
rights
act
and
various
other
statutes
involving
cigarettes,
lotteries,
corporate
press
releases,
this
sort
of
thing
who
all
held
that
commercial
speech
is
not
protected.
but
in
addition
to
this,
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
we
are
dealing
with
speech
that,
in
some
circumstances,
might
have
been
protected,
this
court
has
also
heralded
general
regulatory
statutes
which
incidentally
affect
speech
are
permissible
if
there
is
a
valid
societal
interest
involved.
for
instance,
just
last
term
in
branzburg
against
hayes,
which
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar
with,
with
all
the
publicity
recently;
eight
of
the
nine
justices
here
said
that
we
have
to
balance
the
first
amendment
interest
of
newspaper
reporters
against
the
governmental
interest
and
force
testimony.
you
didn't
all
agree
as
to
where
that
balance
should
be
drawn,
but
you
all
said
it
had
to
be
balanced.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
there
have
been
cases
which
have
so
held
in
this
court
--
it's
our
feeling
that
what
the
petitioner
says
here
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
special
protection,
because
we
are
a
newspaper,
but
in
this
economic
area
it's
not
entitled
to
more
protection
just
because
it
has
editorial
functions,
than
the
ad
in
valentine
was
entitled
to
protection
because
it
was
appended
to
the
back
of
a
political
protest.
this
court
in
the
cases
involving
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
sherman
antitrust
act
has
held
that
newspapers
are
subject
to
those
acts
and
in
the
lorain
journal
case,
that
was
a
case
where
the
newspaper
was
refusing
certain
advertisements
because
it
refused
advertisements
whenever
the
advertiser
advertised
in
a
competitor
competing
radio
station,
and
this
court
said
that
it
was
permissible
to
tell
that
newspaper
that
you
have
to
accept
advertisements
from
those
advertisers.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
think
that's
probably
true.
i
know
this
court
has
before
cases
now
as
to
whether
various
media
have
to
accept
certain
advertisements
as
to
whether
they
have
the
full
freedom
of
contract
there
and
i
don't
think
that's
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
your
honor,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
newspaper
can't
have
this
advertising.
all
they
have
to
do
is
put
it
in
a
single
column.
according
to
their
argument,
they
are
losing
money
by
putting
these
in
separate
columns.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not
but
it's
clear
from
this
record
that
there
is
not
much
difference
one
way
or
the
other
as
far
as
money
is
concerned
in
this
case.
this
isn't
a
situation
like
the
grosjean
case,
where
there
was
an
advertisement,
excuse
me,
a
statute
aimed
directly
at
a
newspaper,
and
here
it's
a
situation
where
there
is
a
general
anti-discrimination
statute.
a
statute
premised
on
an
important
governmental
interest
here;
i
think
it's
an
overwhelming
reason
here.
the
vast
amount
of
discrimination
against
women,
the
statistics
are
in
the
record
here,
mrs.
matson
will
go
into
this
and
in
addition
to
the
overwhelming
reason
for
this,
the
burden
on
the
press
is
absolutely
minimal.
if
the
press,
if
the
newspaper
is
expressing
any
kind
of
idea
here
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
but
then,
you
have
a
situation
like
the
grosjean
case,
where
the
newspaper
is
really
being
deprived
of
its
lifeblood
and
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
situation
than
we
have
here.
i'd
just
like
to
say
one
other
thing
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
this
court,
even
the
absolutist
on
this
court
with
regard
to
free
speech,
have
said
that
conduct
can
be
regulated,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
the
newspaper
isn't
prohibited
from
expressing
its
idea.
if
all
that
we
are
doing
was
expressing
an
idea,
it
would
be
satisfied
to
express
it
in
an
editorial
or
a
news
column,
but
it
said,
“well,
we
have
to
do
it
in
the
want
ad
headings.”
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
conduct
is
participating
in
this
discriminatory
scheme
and
again
and
again,
just
a
last
--
few
months
ago
in
california
against
la
rue,
justice
rehnquist
said
that
conduct
does
not
have
the
protection
that
pure
speech
has.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
your
honor,
if
we
are
dealing
with
just
the
editorial
type
advertiser,
if
they
are
not
actually
hiring
people,
then
i
think
it's
a
new
york
times
against
sullivan
situation
and
this
is
protected
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
they
could
have
this
editorial
advertisement.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
just
a
subterfuge
refused
like
valentine
against
chrestensen
with
protected
speech
on
one
side
and
unprotected
speech
on
the
other,
then
i
feel
that
there
is
no
protection
for
this
and
they
are
governed
by
the
ordinance,
they
are
violating
the
ordinance.
i
would
want
to
conclude
by
saying
that
both
press
and
its
amicus,
the
newspaper
publishers
association,
see
much
more
concerned
about
future
cases
than
this
case
and
it
seems
to
us
that
so
long
as
this
court
sits,
it
can
prevent
the
intrusions
on
the
first
amendment
which
petitioner
fears
and
which
we
desire
no
more
than
they.
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
city
of
pittsburgh
and
it's
human
relations
commission.
the
commission
like
the
eeoc
and
similar
commissions
in
other
states,
many
of
which
are
represented
by
amicus
briefs
here
today
was
created
in
an
attempt
to
eliminate
discrimination
including
employment
discrimination.
a
1969
amendment
to
the
human
relation
ordinance
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
added
a
prohibition
on
the
basis
of
sex
to
the
other
prohibitions
on
race,
religion,
national
origin
grounds.
the
relevant
section
of
the
ordinance
for
our
purposes
is
section
8,
section
8
(e)
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
publish
or
cause
to
be
published
an
advertisement
indication
any
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
section
8
(j)
prohibits
any
person,
which
is
defined
so
as
to
include
a
newspaper
from
aiding
or
participating
in
the
doing
of
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
the
national
organization
for
women
filed
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
press
had
violated
section
8(j)
in
permitting
advertisers
to
advertise
in
these
sex
segregated
columns.
the
commission,
after
a
hearing
and
then
the
common
pleas
court
and
the
commonwealth
courts
of
pennsylvania
held
that
there
were
violations
of
the
ordinance
and
that
no
constitutional
rights
of
petitioner
had
been
abridged.
there
are
two
constitutional
questions
raised
here:
first
amendment
question,
which
i
will
deal
with
and
the
due
process
question,
which
counsel
for
the
national
organization
for
women
will
discuss.
respondents
believe
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
violation
in
this
case.
this
court
has
continually
held
that
constitutionally
protected
speech
is
less
than
absolute
and
the
courts
have
pointed
out
several
ways.
justice
harlan
in
the
konigsberg
case
mentioned
two.
first,
he
said
that
speech
in
certain
context
do
not
have
first
amendment
protection,
and
secondly
he
said
that
general
regulatory
statutes
not
intended
to
control
the
content
of
speech,
but
incidentally,
limiting
its
unfettered
exercise
were
permissible
so
long
as
the
laws
were
justified
by
an
important
governmental
interest.
i
think
that
to
these
two
limitations
we
can
add
a
third,
which
may
just
be
a
subcategory
of
the
second
and
that
is
that
conduct,
even
where
there
are
some
idea
associated
with
it,
does
not
have
the
first
amendment
protection
that
pure
speech
has.
the
petitioners'
activity
in
this
case
we
believe
fails
to
qualify
for
first
amendment
protection
on
not
just
one
of
these
basis,
but
on
all
three.
first
of
all
it's
commercial
speech
and
this
is
one
of
the
context
where
this
court
has
held
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply.
began
in
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
valentine
against
chrestensen
in
316
u.s.,
where
the
court
said
that
while
freedom
of
communicating
information
of
course
enjoys
a
high
degree
of
protection,
the
constitution
imposes
no
such
restrain
on
government
as
respects
purely
commercial
advertising.
we
believe
that
valentine
is
good
law
today;
it's
been
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
in
many
cases
which
we
point
in
our
brief,
and
it's
been
cited
with
approval
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
which
we
find
very
surprising
that
the
petitioner
relies
on.
that
was
a
political
advertisement
in
that
case.
it
recited
grievances,
it
protested
claimed
abuses,
it
expressed
opinion
and
the
court
was
very
careful
to
distinguish
that
political
advertisement
from
the
commercial
advertisement
in
valentine
against
chrestensen.
and
i
think
that
new
york
times,
the
political
advertisement
there,
can
be
distinguished
from
the
advertisements
involved
in
this
case
on
the
same
basis.
this
non-protection
of
commercial
speech,
we
believe,
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense.
professor
emerson
has
rationalized
it
as
applying
--
commercial
speech
applying
to
a
separate
sector
of
economic
activity,
an
area
that
involves
economic
interest
rather
than
the
interest
of
free
expression,
the
production
of
goods
and
services.
the
terms
that
this
court
used
in
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire,
we
are
not
dealing
with
any
essential
part
of
exposition
of
ideas.
i,
again,
find
it
surprising
that
petitioner
would
rely
on
the
meiklejohn
view
of
first
amendment
applying
to
governing
speech,
because
we
feel
that
that's
a
situation
where,
his
theory
says
that
public
affairs,
speech
that
has
to
do
with
public
affairs,
is
protected.
and
i
think
that
this
court
indicated
in
new
york
times
that
it
was
endorsing
the
meiklejohn
theory
when
it
distinguished
between
public
liable
and
private
liable.
it
would
seem
to
me
fairly
obvious
that
this
case
falls
on
the
private
side
of
the
public-private
dichotomy.
the
petitioner's
answer
to
this
as
well
the
advertisements
themselves
may
not
be
ideas,
but
the
column
headings
are
ideas,
they
are
different;
they
are
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
luncheon
break,
i
was
indicating
that
these
commercial
advertisements
are
non-ideas
and
the
petitioners'
response
to
this
is
to
say
that
the
ads
themselves
may
not
be
ideas,
but
that
the
column
headings
are
different,
that
they
are
abbreviated
editorial
comment
that
certain
jobs
are
of
more
interest
to
men
than
to
women.
however,
this
argument
corresponds
neither
to
the
facts,
nor
the
law.
in
answer
to
the
question
that
justice
white
asked,
the
paper
does
not
give
the
slightest
thought
to
whether
the
advertised
job
interest
men
or
women;
it
goes
wherever
the
advertiser
wants
the
ad
to
go,
regardless
of
whether
the
newspaper
might
have
thought
that
this
is
a
female
type
job
or
a
male
type
job.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
your
honor
i
don't
think
that
this
is
anymore
an
idea
than
to
say
that
a
violator
of
the
antitrust
law
says
that
well,
his
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
shows
his
idea
that
monopoly
is
beneficial
to
society.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
completely
disagree
with
the
answer
that
mr.
volk
gave.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well
first
of
all
it's
not
covered
by
the
ordinance.
we
are
talking
about
help
wanted
and
not
jobs
wanted.
the
advertise
--
the
ordinance
speaks
of
an
employer,
an
employment
agency
or
a
labor
union,
placing
an
add
indicating
discrimination.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
he
can
do
that,
because
number
one,
he
is
not
covered
by
the
ordinance
either,
because
the
ordinance
excludes
situations
of
five
or
a
fewer
employees.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
if
the
job
is
certified
as
a
bona
fide
--
as
having
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
then
either
an
employer
or
an
employment
agency
can
place
this
type
of
ad.
this
is
why
the
screening
argument
that
the
petitioner
makes
is
a
complete
red
herring
in
this
case.
there
is
no
screening
argument
even
if
this
were
a
situation
where
the
speech
allegedly
being
chilled
as
in
smith
against
california
were
protected
speech;
there
wouldn't
be
any
screening
argument,
because
it's
perfectly
clear
to
the
newspaper,
whether
this
job
has
a
bona
fide
occupation
qualification.
it
doesn't
have
to
guess
whether
there
is
a
bfoq
for
this
job.
section
7
(d)
of
our
ordinance
as
well
as
a
parallel
provision
in
the
state
ordinance
provides
that
if
there
is
a
--
if
the
employer
wants
a
bona
fide
occupation
exemption,
it
can
apply
to
the
commission
and
get
that
exemption.
so
there
is
no
problem
in
your
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
certainly
there
is
a
judgment
involved.
there
is
a
judgment
involved
in
all
of
these
commissions
as
to
whether
a
job
cannot
be
performed
by
a
male
or
cannot
be
performed
by
a
woman.
perhaps,
the
exemption
is
somewhat
broader
than
that,
for
instance,
a
man
probably,
could
be
a
lingerie
salesman,
but
probably
it
would
qualify
here
for
a
bona
fide
occupation
qualification
under
our
present
situation.
this
type
of
job
has
been
granted
a
bfoq,
even
though
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
that
shouldn't
qualify.
i
don't
know
what
the
commission
would
necessarily
do
with
that
sort
of
case,
but
as
far
as
the
pittsburgh
press
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
have
any
problem
as
far
as
screening
these
advertisements.
it
knows
because
there
either
is
an
exemption
or
there
isn't.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
employer
--
the
advertiser,
whomever
that
maybe.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
paper
doesn't
consider
whether
this
is
a
job
that
interest
men
and
women,
even
if
this
setup
were
created
so
as
to
cater
to
the
reader
preference,
that
would
not
excuse
this
violation
of
the
act
and
the
circuit
courts
have
so
held
in
the
diaz
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
involving
a
stewardess.
the
employer
argue,
well
my
customers
prefer
women
as
performing
this
job
on
airplanes,
and
the
court
says
that
doesn't
excuse
discrimination
what
your
customers
prefer
and
even
if
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
no
your
honor,
it
didn't.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
our
first
contention
is
that
these
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
--
that
these
are
non-ideas
and
these
headings
can't
raise
non-ideas
to
the
level
of
ideas.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
statute,
this
ordinance
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
not
an
unusual
statute.
there
are
--
i
think
a
holding
in
this
case
that
the
first
amendment
was
violated,
would
inferentially
overturn
many,
many
other
statutes,
all
of
which
have
been
sustained
by
the
courts
on
first
amendment
grounds;
for
instance,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which
was
held
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
hayes
case
to
prohibit
an
employer
from
placing
a
want
ad
in
a
sex
segregated
column.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
alright,
most
of
them
have,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
in-advance
a
argument
is
concerned,
this
court
and
other
courts
have
held
that
the
prior-restrain
argument
does
not
apply
where
the
speech
is
not
fully
protected.
for
instance,
in
the
lorain
journal
case
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
necessarily.
first
of
all,
we
feel
that
this
falls
directly
within
valentine
against
chrestensen.
the
case
is
interpreting
the
64
civil
rights
act,
the
68
civil
rights
act
and
various
other
statutes
involving
cigarettes,
lotteries,
corporate
press
releases,
this
sort
of
thing
who
all
held
that
commercial
speech
is
not
protected.
but
in
addition
to
this,
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
we
are
dealing
with
speech
that,
in
some
circumstances,
might
have
been
protected,
this
court
has
also
heralded
general
regulatory
statutes
which
incidentally
affect
speech
are
permissible
if
there
is
a
valid
societal
interest
involved.
for
instance,
just
last
term
in
branzburg
against
hayes,
which
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar
with,
with
all
the
publicity
recently;
eight
of
the
nine
justices
here
said
that
we
have
to
balance
the
first
amendment
interest
of
newspaper
reporters
against
the
governmental
interest
and
force
testimony.
you
didn't
all
agree
as
to
where
that
balance
should
be
drawn,
but
you
all
said
it
had
to
be
balanced.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
there
have
been
cases
which
have
so
held
in
this
court
--
it's
our
feeling
that
what
the
petitioner
says
here
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
special
protection,
because
we
are
a
newspaper,
but
in
this
economic
area
it's
not
entitled
to
more
protection
just
because
it
has
editorial
functions,
than
the
ad
in
valentine
was
entitled
to
protection
because
it
was
appended
to
the
back
of
a
political
protest.
this
court
in
the
cases
involving
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
sherman
antitrust
act
has
held
that
newspapers
are
subject
to
those
acts
and
in
the
lorain
journal
case,
that
was
a
case
where
the
newspaper
was
refusing
certain
advertisements
because
it
refused
advertisements
whenever
the
advertiser
advertised
in
a
competitor
competing
radio
station,
and
this
court
said
that
it
was
permissible
to
tell
that
newspaper
that
you
have
to
accept
advertisements
from
those
advertisers.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
think
that's
probably
true.
i
know
this
court
has
before
cases
now
as
to
whether
various
media
have
to
accept
certain
advertisements
as
to
whether
they
have
the
full
freedom
of
contract
there
and
i
don't
think
that's
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
your
honor,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
newspaper
can't
have
this
advertising.
all
they
have
to
do
is
put
it
in
a
single
column.
according
to
their
argument,
they
are
losing
money
by
putting
these
in
separate
columns.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not
but
it's
clear
from
this
record
that
there
is
not
much
difference
one
way
or
the
other
as
far
as
money
is
concerned
in
this
case.
this
isn't
a
situation
like
the
grosjean
case,
where
there
was
an
advertisement,
excuse
me,
a
statute
aimed
directly
at
a
newspaper,
and
here
it's
a
situation
where
there
is
a
general
anti-discrimination
statute.
a
statute
premised
on
an
important
governmental
interest
here;
i
think
it's
an
overwhelming
reason
here.
the
vast
amount
of
discrimination
against
women,
the
statistics
are
in
the
record
here,
mrs.
matson
will
go
into
this
and
in
addition
to
the
overwhelming
reason
for
this,
the
burden
on
the
press
is
absolutely
minimal.
if
the
press,
if
the
newspaper
is
expressing
any
kind
of
idea
here
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
but
then,
you
have
a
situation
like
the
grosjean
case,
where
the
newspaper
is
really
being
deprived
of
its
lifeblood
and
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
situation
than
we
have
here.
i'd
just
like
to
say
one
other
thing
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
this
court,
even
the
absolutist
on
this
court
with
regard
to
free
speech,
have
said
that
conduct
can
be
regulated,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
the
newspaper
isn't
prohibited
from
expressing
its
idea.
if
all
that
we
are
doing
was
expressing
an
idea,
it
would
be
satisfied
to
express
it
in
an
editorial
or
a
news
column,
but
it
said,
“well,
we
have
to
do
it
in
the
want
ad
headings.”
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
conduct
is
participating
in
this
discriminatory
scheme
and
again
and
again,
just
a
last
--
few
months
ago
in
california
against
la
rue,
justice
rehnquist
said
that
conduct
does
not
have
the
protection
that
pure
speech
has.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
your
honor,
if
we
are
dealing
with
just
the
editorial
type
advertiser,
if
they
are
not
actually
hiring
people,
then
i
think
it's
a
new
york
times
against
sullivan
situation
and
this
is
protected
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
they
could
have
this
editorial
advertisement.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
just
a
subterfuge
refused
like
valentine
against
chrestensen
with
protected
speech
on
one
side
and
unprotected
speech
on
the
other,
then
i
feel
that
there
is
no
protection
for
this
and
they
are
governed
by
the
ordinance,
they
are
violating
the
ordinance.
i
would
want
to
conclude
by
saying
that
both
press
and
its
amicus,
the
newspaper
publishers
association,
see
much
more
concerned
about
future
cases
than
this
case
and
it
seems
to
us
that
so
long
as
this
court
sits,
it
can
prevent
the
intrusions
on
the
first
amendment
which
petitioner
fears
and
which
we
desire
no
more
than
they.
thank
you.
