justice
byron
r.
white
who
made
the
decision
just
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
which
column
heading
each
ad
went
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
there
are
--
in
this
case
there
are
instances
i
suppose
where
we
are
talking
about
ads,
a
part
of
which
the
newspaper
made
the
decision
as
to
which
column
it
went
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
help,
but
it's
the
one
who
makes
the
decision
as
to
which
column
to
put
it
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
invariably
then
the
advertiser
is
the
one
who
finally
says
the
newspaper,
“well
after
now
that
i
have
talked
to
you
i
would
suggest
to
go
into
this
column."
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
isn't
an
independent
judgment
of
the
newspaper
as
to
which
--
it
isn't
its
judgment
as
to
whether
this
job
is
more
attractive
to
males
or
females.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
advertisers
have
said
--
if
in
each
case
the
advertisers
said
to
put
it
in
the
other
column,
the
newspaper
would
put
it
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
its
judgment
in
any
case
as
to
whether
the
job
was
more
fitting
for
male?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
proof
is
that
advertisers
utilize
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
not
--
does
your
case
hang
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
let's
assume
valentine
survives,
it
just
survives,
do
you
lose?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
would
assume
that
you
wouldn't
--
if
there
is
any
way
around
valentine
that's
reasonable,
you
would
suggest,
we
do
that
first
as
an
overrule
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
a
major
part
of
your
argument
perhaps
was
that
even
if
commercial
speech
isn't
protected,
there
is
more
to
this
speech
here
than
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
that
part
of
it
if
--
i
suppose
you
say
that
we
can
decide
the
case
in
your
favor
without
overruling
valentine
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
it
be
enough
for
the
state
to
move
against
the
employer
and
forbid
the
employer
from
indicating
to
the
paper
any
preference
whatsoever
unless
he
had
a
certificate?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
press
would
ever
--
do
you
think
the
press
would
continue
this
if
employer
was
forbidden
when
the
paper
asked
him
to
specify
a
column?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
no
employer
would
ever
break
the
law
if
it
was
forbidden
to
indicate
a
preference
and
that
whenever
they
were
asked,
they
say
“awfully
sorry,
we
just
couldn't
care
less.”
do
you
think
the
press
itself
would
then
go
on
with
the
scheme?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
have
the
answer
to
that
question
before
you
can
justify
putting
a
prohibition
on
the
press
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
in
this
case,
it's
a
conservation
of
resources,
there
is
only
one
newspaper.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
you
concede
that,
don't
you
that
if
you
could
get
an
injunction
against
the
press
you
can
also
get
an
injunction
against
the
employer
for
communicating
with
the
press
as
to
what
column
to
put
it
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
could
you
or
couldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
not
readily
but
legally,
couldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
made
the
decision
just
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
which
column
heading
each
ad
went
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
there
are
--
in
this
case
there
are
instances
i

where
we
are
talking
about

a
