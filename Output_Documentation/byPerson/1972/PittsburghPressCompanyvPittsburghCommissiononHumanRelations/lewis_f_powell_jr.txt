mr.
strassburger,
in
connection
with
the
distinction
you
are
now
drawing
between
editorial
and
commercial
advertising,
may
i
put
this
hypothetical?
suppose
an
employer
who
profoundly
disagreed
with
the
social
utility
of
the
ordinance
in
question,
went
to
the
newspaper
and
said
i
want
to
buy
a
full
page
ad,
in
which
to
express
my
disapproval
of
the
ordinance
and
including
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
i
want
to
engage
women
only
for
whatever
his
business
maybe
and
i
want
to
state
the
reasons
why
i
think
they
should
be
exempt
from
this
law
or
that
the
law
is
invalid.
would
that
be
something
that
in
your
view
the
newspaper
would
be
prohibited
from
publishing?
