justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
mr.
piga
i
gather
that
it
is
the
fact,
isn't
it
that
the
orders
are
filled
from
stocks
maintained
within
the
state
and
you
say
this
is
only
a
technicality
but
such
orders
as
are
finally
filled,
are
filled
with
stocks
maintained
within
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
don't
go
to
the
ultimate
purchaser
yet?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
from
wherever
he
keeps
and
that
they
are
finally
filled,
you
mentioned
that
they
are
already
actually
on
the
warehouse
platforms
somewhere?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
the
senate
report
expressly
or
rather
carefully
say
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
would
be
such
that
in
a
fact
situation
like
this
the
immunity
would
not
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
we
don't
agree
with
that,
if
we
think
it
falls
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
that's
the
end
of
the
case
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
gather
you
don't
challenge
the
authority
of
the
state
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
that
required
district
court
(voice
overlap)
localization
in
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
consigned
to
the
representative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
consigned
on
the
paper
or
consigned
to
the
representative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
instances
where
you
don't
have
as
much
confidence
in
the
distributors
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
you
--
where
the
producer's
representative
must
physically
receive
of
the
liquor
when
it
comes
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
suppose
that
john
jones
is
the
producer's
representative,
it's
john
jones
and
the
address
given
as
the
distributor's
warehouse?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
what
is
you
just
say
and
suggested
and
you
know
of
no
instances
where
the
approval
had
been
withheld.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

your
honor,
for
any
violation
a
license
maybe
revoked
and
that
being
the
license
of
the
registered
producer
authorized
the
ship,
or
the
license
of
the
wholesaler
seeking
to
buy
this
liquor
and
for
a

it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
violation
i
assume
as

whether
or
not
they
would
revoke
the

refuse
to
allow

to
purchase
liquor.
it

william
j.
brennan,

is
another
way
of
saying
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
an
authority
to
south
carolina.

they
require
a
liquor
producer
to
localize
it's
operations
within
south
carolina
as
to
avoid
the
application
of
the
federal
statute?

that's

you

south

has
done
here?
