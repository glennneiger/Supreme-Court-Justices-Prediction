mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
major
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
exceeded
the
minimum
standards
of
public
law
86-272.
now
counsel
for
heublein
has
raised
–
very
ably
stated
the
requirements
on
the
restrictions
in
public
law
86-272,
therefore,
we'll
not
comment
further
on
that,
but
i
disagree
with
his
argument
on
the
facts
because
i
think
that
they
are
contrary
to
the
facts
as
is
set
out
in
the
record
taken
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
south
carolina.
briefly,
if
i
may
comment
all
of
the
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
are
voluntary
activities,
otherwise
they
wouldn't
be
there.
so
i
think
that
to
assume
that
some
of
the
activities
are
involuntary
and
others
are
voluntary
would
be
a
point
that
bears
no
--
that
does
not
have
any
warrant
to
it.
it's
just
a
facetious
argument
in
my
opinion.
there
are,
however,
certain
requirements,
relating
to
the
shipment
and
delivery
of
alcoholic
liquors
in
the
south
carolina.
and
the
part
of
it
or
the
most
important
provision
are
the
abc
law
in
regard
to
this
case
is
found
--
is
section
4-134
the
code
of
laws
which
states
that
no
alcoholic
liquor
shall
be
shipped
into
south
carolina
except
by
a
registered
producer
and
a
registered
producer
is
defined
by
statute
to
be
one
who
is
involved
in
the
manufacture
of
alcoholic
liquors
or
one
who
had
a
license
to
import
liquors
into
the
united
states
from
foreign
countries.
therefore,
i
think
that
the
first
premise
that
this
case
stands
on
is
the
fact
that
importation
in
interstate
commerce
is
precluded.
therefore,
we
are
not
concerned
with
public
law
86-272,
as
defined
in
the
introductory
paragraph
of
that
section
that
net
income
from
business
in
interstate
commerce
shall
be
protected
where
the
minimum
activities
meet
the
requirements
set
out
in
that
statute.
so
the
framers
of
public
law
86-272,
first,
supposed
that
we
would
be
--
that
interstate
commerce
would
be
protected
and
not
intrastate
commerce.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
purely
a
case
of
intrastate
sales
of
liquor
by
heublein.
the
shipment
of
alcoholic
liquor
must
be
made
in
accordance
with
statutes
which
are
set
out
and
which
require
that
prior
to
a
shipment
into
the
state,
the
registered
producer
who
is
registered
and
licensed
to
ship
into
the
state
must
file
with
the
state
an
invoice
and
the
bill
of
lading
setting
out
in
detail
the
specific
quantities,
type,
sizes,
brands,
and
so
forth
liquors
which
are
to
be
shipped
into
the
state.
now
these
requirements
are
all
regulatory
and
so
far
as
controlling
the
flow
of
liquor
or
the
moment
of
liquor
across
the
state
boundaries.
and
if
you
read
in
the
particular
statute,
you
will
see
that
that
was
specifically
provided,
because
the
terms
from
a
port
without
the
geographical
boundaries
to
import
within
the
geographical
boundaries,
shipment
shall
be
controlled.
the
shipment
further
must
be
to
the
producer
representative
of
the
registered
producer,
who
shall
take
the
delivery
or
accept
the
delivery
with
in
south
carolina
and
upon
acceptance
he
is
required
to
submit
to
the
state
in
the
--
an
invoice
for
which
he
endorses
the
delivery,
showing
in
detail
the
quantity
that
types
and
so
forth
of
liquor
which
have
been
received
within
the
state.
therefore
from
the
time
the
delivery,
from
the
time
the
shipment
by
the
importer
commences,
it
must
be
controlled
and
the
movement
is
controlled
until
it
ends
in
south
of
carolina.
now
this
is
probably
an
interstate
shipment.
well,
here
again
this
must
to
come
to
rest
at
some
point
in
south
carolina.
now
bearing
on
the
points
for
a
moment
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
concede
to
the
point
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
do
make
that
point,
your
honor.
i
make
the
point
that
the
twenty-first
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
twenty-first
amendment,
yes
the
state's
exclusive
right
and
control
to
regulate
the
traffic
into
the
state
and
to
that
extent,
i
would
say
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
override
the
commerce
clause,
yes.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
interest
of
the
state
in
these
regulations
is
to
provide
that
all
shipments
shall
be
by
one
party,
that
party
being
subject
to
the
exclusive
control
of
the
state.
well,
for
this
control
can
provide
an
accounting
for
the
liquor
at
all
stages
of
its
movement
from
the
commencement
of
the
shipment
from
without
a
state
to
which
arrival
within
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
this
would
apply,
that
we
would
--
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
or
any
state
would
have
the
right
to
control
the
shipment
of
groceries
because
they
are
not
specifically
protected
or
the
state
is
not
being
specifically
given
the
authority
under
the
twenty-first
to
regulate
the
sale
of
groceries
or
any
other
ordinary
articles
of
commerce
by
the
way.
getting
back
to
the
report
that
i
wanted
to
make
was,
by
the
liquor
being,
by
the
time
that
the
liquor
reaches
south
carolina
and
is
owned
and
possessed
by
pipeline,
the
state
should
have
complete
control
and
notice
that
it
is
in
south
carolina.
thereafter,
prior
to
any
further
transfer
of
this
liquor,
the
state
must
be
notified
that
the
liquor
is
being
--
has
been
--
sales
for
the
liquor
has
been
solicited
and
that
the
permission
is
being
sought
for
the
transfer
of
it
or
just
like
a
(inaudible)
perspective
in
this
case.
i
might
emphasis
at
this
point
that
if
that
would
appear
to
the
court
that
these
liquor
regulations
and
the
control
of
this
liquor
might
appear
to
have
been
taken
lightly,
in
this
particular
case
it
is
because
the
sole
distributor
for
the
major
portion
of
the
years
involved
in
this
case
was
a
distributor
situated
within
10
blocks
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
commission
and
that
it
had
been
a
very
liable
distributor
and
it
was
therefore
not
necessary
for
them
to
be
subjected
to
the
--
that
it
is
passed
that
some
distributors
would
be
subjected
to.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
physically,
it
was
delivered
at
the
distributor's
warehouse.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
papers,
the
liquor
was
actually
consigned
to
the
producer
representative
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
papers
are
required
by
statute
to
be
forwarded
by
the
producer
to
the
producer
representative
and
upon
receipt
and
upon
arrival
with,
all
this
liquor
in
south
carolina
and
by
the
way,
it
must
be
transmitted
by
common
carrier
so
that
the
control
can
be
--
proper
control
can
be
maintained,
but
those
documents
are
submitted
to
the
producer
representative
when
a
shipment
commences.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
they
are
submitted
to
the
producer
representative
by
the
producer.
he
forwards
or
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
he
forwards
them
by
mail
to
the
producer
and
he
also
forwards
those
same
documents
to
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
when
the
documents
are
received
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
--
by
the
representative
and
after
the
liquor
has
arrived
within
the
state
and
are
delivered
by
the
common
carrier
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
--
to
the
distributor's
warehouse,
they
are
set
aside
at
that
moment.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
they
are
set
aside
and
they
are
not
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
they
are
consigned
by
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
as
i
understand,
yes.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
are
instances
in
which
they
set
a
delivery,
and
actual
physical
transfer
of
the
property
could
not
be
made
to
a
common
carrier.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
law
states
that
it
shall
be
delivered
to
the
producer
representative.
now
the
term
physically
is
not
used
there.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
there
is
well
provision
of
the
statute
that
would
preclude
a
producer
representative
from
accepting
the
shipment
on
the
platform
or
the
loading
dock
of
the
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
he
is
required
on
his
documents,
the
shipping
document
state
that
the
consignment
is
to
the
producer
representative.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
at
the
location
of
the
wholesale
of
warehouse.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
what
warehouse
to
deliver
to
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
that
just
happens
to
be
the
distributor
warehouse
and
they
are
delivered
there.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
a
distributor's
warehouse,
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
in
this
--
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
if
you
read
in
the
record
they
put
--
the
producer
representative
has
office
space
at
the
distributor's
warehouse
at
which
point
he
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
that's
one
of
his
addresses
and
that
is
one
point
at
which
he
has
furnished
office
space
to
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
to
facilitate
the
transaction
and
to
complete
the
necessary
documents.
now
i
might
add
that
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
he
takes
the
papers
and
he
seeks
the
permission
of
the
state
to
make
a
transfer.
those
papers
must
be
submitted
properly
endorsed
on
the
time,
the
quantity
and
everything
in
that
ship
and
the
time
in
which
they
would
--
a
lot,
that
they
arrived
and
the
shipment
was
accepted.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
thereafter,
he
uprise
for
a
certificate
of
transfer
which
would
give
him
permission
to
transfer
the
legal
ownership
and
title
and
make
a
–
and
to
affect
the
sale
and
delivery
of
this
liquor.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
certificate
is
a
form
which
is
supplied
to
him
and
upon
which
he
has
to
fill
out
all
and
give
all
the
requirements.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
that
certificate
is
applied
and
all
has
to
do.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
yes
it
is.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
this
certificate
is
like
a
certificate
with
upon
--
with
that
he
fills
the
form
out,
the
form
is
not
filled
out
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
signed
in
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
he
fills
out
the
form,
carries
it
to
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
commission
and
requests
that
a
approval
for
the
transfer
be
granted.
it
is
at
that
time
that
the
state
decides
whether
or
not
they
can
grant
the
approval
for
the
transfer
and
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
–
is
silent
on
the
point
that
--
as
to
whether
or
not
a
shipment
has
ever
been
refused,
but
it
at
that
point,
that
the
decision
is
made
whether
or
not,
the
wholesaler
is
entitled
purchase
this
liquor.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
know
of
none
with
this
particular
wholesaler.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
any
storage
by
heublein
in
south
carolina,
must
be
made
in
a
a
bonded
warehouse
or
upon
it
--
or
it's
own
warehouse.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
to
be
legal
a
storage.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
it
was
shipped
to
the
wholesaler's
warehouse
and
i
think
you
fond
that
the
record
is
silent
as
to
how
long
that
liquor
may
have
rested
on
a
loading
dock
before
it
was
actually
reported
to
the
state
that
it
had
arrived.
so
legally
i
don't
assume
and
i
don't
suppose
that
any
liquor
could
arrive
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
that
could
legally
be
accepted
by
anyone
except
the
producer
representative
and
the
common
carrier
maybe
at
fault
for
leaving
it
with
someone
else.
we
are
confronted
with
the
question
of
acceptance
or
rejection
of
an
order
in
--
the
statue
public
law
86-272
to
be
applicable
must
show
that
it
--
to
be
applicable,
the
activities
must
show
that
any
order
solicited
in
south
carolina
was
set
outside
the
state
where
there
were
accepted
or
rejected
and
along
the
lines
of
the
question
previously
asked
by
the
court,
i
would
suggest
that
no
acceptance
could
be
made
of
an
order
prior
to
the
liquor
reaching
south
carolina
and
being
received
by
the
producer
representative
in
south
carolina.
therefore,
any
order
would
be
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
state
before
it
could
be
accepted
and
in
south
carolina
and
generally
in
all
of
the
states
i
think
that
for
a
sale
to
be
consummated
there
must
be
a
passing
of
title
and
there
must
be
a
delivery
granting
the
person,
acquiring
such
--
any
purchase
of
property,
granting
the
person
purchasing
property
to
--
the
right
to
receive
such
property.
there
is
no
right
until
that
permission
is
granted
in
this
case.
therefore,
for
that
reason,
public
law
86-272
is
inapplicable.
so
summarizing
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can't
agree
with
you
in
that
respect.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
liquor
business
is
different,
yes.
the
commerce
clause
protects
all
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
it
would
be
very
questionable
and
i
think
under
the
court's
holding
in
the
case
of
the
south
carolina
highway
department
versus
barnwell,
the
court
would
take
jurisdiction
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
had
exceeded
it's
authority
with
respect
to
that
type
of
regulation.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
if
i
follow
your
question,
i
think
the
--
i
don't
think
title
passage
is
a
--
i
don't
think
title
passage
is
a
point
that
we
would
look
to
in
determining
whether
public
law
86-272
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
we
are
looking
to
determine
if
we
have
first
an
interstate
sale
and
i
state
that
we
need
not
go
no
further
and
that
is
in
line
with
the
decisions
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
issued
that
we
had
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
--
intrastate
commerce,
a
local
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
title.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
because
title
passed
in
south
carolina
because
title
could
not
have
passed
without
south
carolina,
second
because
acceptance
of
the
shipment
could
not
be
accepted
without
south
carolina.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor,
title
passage
will
not
in
my
opinion
control
the
applicability
of
public
law
86-272
or
the
commerce
clause.
the
commerce
clause
speaks
notwithstanding
state
law
title
passage
and
it
would
protect
any
shipment
with
in
which
the
transfer
is
from
without
the
state
to
within
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
this
regulation
is
not
under
attack.
the
case
would
depend
upon
the
authority
granted
to
the
states
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
state
of
south
carolina
in
my
opinion
would
not
have
the
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
to
regulate
the
shipment
into
the
state
from
without
the
state
any
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
we
are
back
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
which
states
that
the
state
is
granted
exclusive
control
over
liquors
which
are
brought
into
it
for
use
and
delivery
therein.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor,
i
say
that
the
state
has
no
authority
to
erect
a
trade
barrier
as
is
found.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
this
court
has
upheld
in
the
northwestern
state
case
the
right
of
the
state
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
--
to
tax
such
a
transaction.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
it
could
tax
the
income
produced
because
of
such
transaction
to
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
well
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
state
that
if
the
sale
is
in
intrastate
sale
if
it
is
shipped
to
his
representative
then
it
becomes
an
intrastate
sale,
any
subsequent
sale
made
by
the
producer
representative
or
by
a
producer,
his
employee.
but
if
the
transaction
is
one
in
interstate
commerce,
this
court
has
recognized
the
right
of
a
state
to
tax
the
net
income
resulting
from
that
transaction
provided
that
that
tax
is
an
apportioned
tax
which
bears
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
act
--
relationship
to
the
activities
within
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
technicalities
of
the
paper
are
not
the
important
points
that
i
would
like
to
emphasis
in
this
case.
it
is
the
fact
that
the
title,
the
right,
the
ownership
and
the
possession
of
the
goods
are
retained
by
the
producer
so
long
as
they
are
in
south
carolina.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor
that
is
correct.
it's
the
actual
activities
of
heublein
in
the
state
which
bare
out
the
right
of
the
state
to
impose
it's
tax
on
that
income
produced
in
the
state.
we
are
not
concerned
with
that.
i
think
we
get
law
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that
statement.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
say
we
have
the
statue,
yes,
have
required
the
activities
to
be
become
so
localized
as
to
exceed
the
minimum
standards
for
protection
set
out
in
public
law
86-272.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
major
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
exceeded
the
minimum
standards
of
public
law
86-272.
now
counsel
for
heublein
has
raised
–
very
ably
stated
the
requirements
on
the
restrictions
in
public
law
86-272,
therefore,
we'll
not
comment
further
on
that,
but
i
disagree
with
his
argument
on
the
facts
because
i
think
that
they
are
contrary
to
the
facts
as
is
set
out
in
the
record
taken
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
south
carolina.
briefly,
if
i
may
comment
all
of
the
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
are
voluntary
activities,
otherwise
they
wouldn't
be
there.
so
i
think
that
to
assume
that
some
of
the
activities
are
involuntary
and
others
are
voluntary
would
be
a
point
that
bears
no
--
that
does
not
have
any
warrant
to
it.
it's
just
a
facetious
argument
in
my
opinion.
there
are,
however,
certain
requirements,
relating
to
the
shipment
and
delivery
of
alcoholic
liquors
in
the
south
carolina.
and
the
part
of
it
or
the
most
important
provision
are
the
abc
law
in
regard
to
this
case
is
found
--
is
section
4-134
the
code
of
laws
which
states
that
no
alcoholic
liquor
shall
be
shipped
into
south
carolina
except
by
a
registered
producer
and
a
registered
producer
is
defined
by
statute
to
be
one
who
is
involved
in
the
manufacture
of
alcoholic
liquors
or
one
who
had
a
license
to
import
liquors
into
the
united
states
from
foreign
countries.
therefore,
i
think
that
the
first
premise
that
this
case
stands
on
is
the
fact
that
importation
in
interstate
commerce
is
precluded.
therefore,
we
are
not
concerned
with
public
law
86-272,
as
defined
in
the
introductory
paragraph
of
that
section
that
net
income
from
business
in
interstate
commerce
shall
be
protected
where
the
minimum
activities
meet
the
requirements
set
out
in
that
statute.
so
the
framers
of
public
law
86-272,
first,
supposed
that
we
would
be
--
that
interstate
commerce
would
be
protected
and
not
intrastate
commerce.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
purely
a
case
of
intrastate
sales
of
liquor
by
heublein.
the
shipment
of
alcoholic
liquor
must
be
made
in
accordance
with
statutes
which
are
set
out
and
which
require
that
prior
to
a
shipment
into
the
state,
the
registered
producer
who
is
registered
and
licensed
to
ship
into
the
state
must
file
with
the
state
an
invoice
and
the
bill
of
lading
setting
out
in
detail
the
specific
quantities,
type,
sizes,
brands,
and
so
forth
liquors
which
are
to
be
shipped
into
the
state.
now
these
requirements
are
all
regulatory
and
so
far
as
controlling
the
flow
of
liquor
or
the
moment
of
liquor
across
the
state
boundaries.
and
if
you
read
in
the
particular
statute,
you
will
see
that
that
was
specifically
provided,
because
the
terms
from
a
port
without
the
geographical
boundaries
to
import
within
the
geographical
boundaries,
shipment
shall
be
controlled.
the
shipment
further
must
be
to
the
producer
representative
of
the
registered
producer,
who
shall
take
the
delivery
or
accept
the
delivery
with
in
south
carolina
and
upon
acceptance
he
is
required
to
submit
to
the
state
in
the
--
an
invoice
for
which
he
endorses
the
delivery,
showing
in
detail
the
quantity
that
types
and
so
forth
of
liquor
which
have
been
received
within
the
state.
therefore
from
the
time
the
delivery,
from
the
time
the
shipment
by
the
importer
commences,
it
must
be
controlled
and
the
movement
is
controlled
until
it
ends
in
south
of
carolina.
now
this
is
probably
an
interstate
shipment.
well,
here
again
this
must
to
come
to
rest
at
some
point
in
south
carolina.
now
bearing
on
the
points
for
a
moment
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
concede
to
the
point
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
do
make
that
point,
your
honor.
i
make
the
point
that
the
twenty-first
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
twenty-first
amendment,
yes
the
state's
exclusive
right
and
control
to
regulate
the
traffic
into
the
state
and
to
that
extent,
i
would
say
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
override
the
commerce
clause,
yes.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
interest
of
the
state
in
these
regulations
is
to
provide
that
all
shipments
shall
be
by
one
party,
that
party
being
subject
to
the
exclusive
control
of
the
state.
well,
for
this
control
can
provide
an
accounting
for
the
liquor
at
all
stages
of
its
movement
from
the
commencement
of
the
shipment
from
without
a
state
to
which
arrival
within
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
this
would
apply,
that
we
would
--
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
or
any
state
would
have
the
right
to
control
the
shipment
of
groceries
because
they
are
not
specifically
protected
or
the
state
is
not
being
specifically
given
the
authority
under
the
twenty-first
to
regulate
the
sale
of
groceries
or
any
other
ordinary
articles
of
commerce
by
the
way.
getting
back
to
the
report
that
i
wanted
to
make
was,
by
the
liquor
being,
by
the
time
that
the
liquor
reaches
south
carolina
and
is
owned
and
possessed
by
pipeline,
the
state
should
have
complete
control
and
notice
that
it
is
in
south
carolina.
thereafter,
prior
to
any
further
transfer
of
this
liquor,
the
state
must
be
notified
that
the
liquor
is
being
--
has
been
--
sales
for
the
liquor
has
been
solicited
and
that
the
permission
is
being
sought
for
the
transfer
of
it
or
just
like
a
(inaudible)
perspective
in
this
case.
i
might
emphasis
at
this
point
that
if
that
would
appear
to
the
court
that
these
liquor
regulations
and
the
control
of
this
liquor
might
appear
to
have
been
taken
lightly,
in
this
particular
case
it
is
because
the
sole
distributor
for
the
major
portion
of
the
years
involved
in
this
case
was
a
distributor
situated
within
10
blocks
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
commission
and
that
it
had
been
a
very
liable
distributor
and
it
was
therefore
not
necessary
for
them
to
be
subjected
to
the
--
that
it
is
passed
that
some
distributors
would
be
subjected
to.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
physically,
it
was
delivered
at
the
distributor's
warehouse.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
papers,
the
liquor
was
actually
consigned
to
the
producer
representative
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
papers
are
required
by
statute
to
be
forwarded
by
the
producer
to
the
producer
representative
and
upon
receipt
and
upon
arrival
with,
all
this
liquor
in
south
carolina
and
by
the
way,
it
must
be
transmitted
by
common
carrier
so
that
the
control
can
be
--
proper
control
can
be
maintained,
but
those
documents
are
submitted
to
the
producer
representative
when
a
shipment
commences.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
they
are
submitted
to
the
producer
representative
by
the
producer.
he
forwards
or
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
he
forwards
them
by
mail
to
the
producer
and
he
also
forwards
those
same
documents
to
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
when
the
documents
are
received
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
--
by
the
representative
and
after
the
liquor
has
arrived
within
the
state
and
are
delivered
by
the
common
carrier
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
--
to
the
distributor's
warehouse,
they
are
set
aside
at
that
moment.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
they
are
set
aside
and
they
are
not
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
they
are
consigned
by
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
as
i
understand,
yes.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
are
instances
in
which
they
set
a
delivery,
and
actual
physical
transfer
of
the
property
could
not
be
made
to
a
common
carrier.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
law
states
that
it
shall
be
delivered
to
the
producer
representative.
now
the
term
physically
is
not
used
there.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
there
is
well
provision
of
the
statute
that
would
preclude
a
producer
representative
from
accepting
the
shipment
on
the
platform
or
the
loading
dock
of
the
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
he
is
required
on
his
documents,
the
shipping
document
state
that
the
consignment
is
to
the
producer
representative.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
at
the
location
of
the
wholesale
of
warehouse.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
what
warehouse
to
deliver
to
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
that
just
happens
to
be
the
distributor
warehouse
and
they
are
delivered
there.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
a
distributor's
warehouse,
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
in
this
--
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
if
you
read
in
the
record
they
put
--
the
producer
representative
has
office
space
at
the
distributor's
warehouse
at
which
point
he
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
that's
one
of
his
addresses
and
that
is
one
point
at
which
he
has
furnished
office
space
to
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
to
facilitate
the
transaction
and
to
complete
the
necessary
documents.
now
i
might
add
that
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
he
takes
the
papers
and
he
seeks
the
permission
of
the
state
to
make
a
transfer.
those
papers
must
be
submitted
properly
endorsed
on
the
time,
the
quantity
and
everything
in
that
ship
and
the
time
in
which
they
would
--
a
lot,
that
they
arrived
and
the
shipment
was
accepted.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
thereafter,
he
uprise
for
a
certificate
of
transfer
which
would
give
him
permission
to
transfer
the
legal
ownership
and
title
and
make
a
–
and
to
affect
the
sale
and
delivery
of
this
liquor.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
certificate
is
a
form
which
is
supplied
to
him
and
upon
which
he
has
to
fill
out
all
and
give
all
the
requirements.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
that
certificate
is
applied
and
all
has
to
do.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
yes
it
is.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
this
certificate
is
like
a
certificate
with
upon
--
with
that
he
fills
the
form
out,
the
form
is
not
filled
out
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
signed
in
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
he
fills
out
the
form,
carries
it
to
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
commission
and
requests
that
a
approval
for
the
transfer
be
granted.
it
is
at
that
time
that
the
state
decides
whether
or
not
they
can
grant
the
approval
for
the
transfer
and
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
–
is
silent
on
the
point
that
--
as
to
whether
or
not
a
shipment
has
ever
been
refused,
but
it
at
that
point,
that
the
decision
is
made
whether
or
not,
the
wholesaler
is
entitled
purchase
this
liquor.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
know
of
none
with
this
particular
wholesaler.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
any
storage
by
heublein
in
south
carolina,
must
be
made
in
a
a
bonded
warehouse
or
upon
it
--
or
it's
own
warehouse.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
to
be
legal
a
storage.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
it
was
shipped
to
the
wholesaler's
warehouse
and
i
think
you
fond
that
the
record
is
silent
as
to
how
long
that
liquor
may
have
rested
on
a
loading
dock
before
it
was
actually
reported
to
the
state
that
it
had
arrived.
so
legally
i
don't
assume
and
i
don't
suppose
that
any
liquor
could
arrive
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
that
could
legally
be
accepted
by
anyone
except
the
producer
representative
and
the
common
carrier
maybe
at
fault
for
leaving
it
with
someone
else.
we
are
confronted
with
the
question
of
acceptance
or
rejection
of
an
order
in
--
the
statue
public
law
86-272
to
be
applicable
must
show
that
it
--
to
be
applicable,
the
activities
must
show
that
any
order
solicited
in
south
carolina
was
set
outside
the
state
where
there
were
accepted
or
rejected
and
along
the
lines
of
the
question
previously
asked
by
the
court,
i
would
suggest
that
no
acceptance
could
be
made
of
an
order
prior
to
the
liquor
reaching
south
carolina
and
being
received
by
the
producer
representative
in
south
carolina.
therefore,
any
order
would
be
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
state
before
it
could
be
accepted
and
in
south
carolina
and
generally
in
all
of
the
states
i
think
that
for
a
sale
to
be
consummated
there
must
be
a
passing
of
title
and
there
must
be
a
delivery
granting
the
person,
acquiring
such
--
any
purchase
of
property,
granting
the
person
purchasing
property
to
--
the
right
to
receive
such
property.
there
is
no
right
until
that
permission
is
granted
in
this
case.
therefore,
for
that
reason,
public
law
86-272
is
inapplicable.
so
summarizing
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can't
agree
with
you
in
that
respect.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
liquor
business
is
different,
yes.
the
commerce
clause
protects
all
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
it
would
be
very
questionable
and
i
think
under
the
court's
holding
in
the
case
of
the
south
carolina
highway
department
versus
barnwell,
the
court
would
take
jurisdiction
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
had
exceeded
it's
authority
with
respect
to
that
type
of
regulation.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
if
i
follow
your
question,
i
think
the
--
i
don't
think
title
passage

i
don't
think
title
passage
is
a
point
that
we
would
look
to
in
determining

public
law
86-272
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
we
are
looking
to
determine
if
we
have
first
an
interstate
sale
and
i
state
that
we
need
not
go
no
further
and
that
is
in
line
with
the
decisions
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
issued
that
we
had
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
--
intrastate
commerce,
a
local

title.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
because
title
passed
in
south
carolina
because
title
could
not
have
passed
without
south
carolina,
second
because
acceptance
of
the
shipment
could
not
be
accepted
without
south
carolina.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor,
title
passage
will
not
in
my
opinion
control
the
applicability
of
public
law
86-272
or
the
commerce
clause.
the
commerce
clause
speaks
notwithstanding
state
law
title
passage
and
it
would
protect
any
shipment
with
in
which
the
transfer
is
from
without
the
state
to
within
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
this
regulation
is
not
under
attack.
the
case
would
depend
upon
the
authority
granted
to
the
states
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
state
of
south
carolina
in
my
opinion
would
not
have
the
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
to
regulate
the
shipment
into
the
state
from
without
the
state
any
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
we
are
back
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
which
states
that
the
state
is
granted
exclusive
control
over
liquors
which
are
brought
into
it
for
use
and
delivery
therein.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor,
i
say
that
the
state
has
no
authority
to
erect
a
trade
barrier
as
is
found.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
this
court
has
upheld
in
the
northwestern
state
case
the
right
of
the
state
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
--
to
tax
such
a
transaction.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
it
could
tax
the
income
produced
because
of
such
transaction
to
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
well
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
state
that
if
the
sale
is
in
intrastate
sale
if
it
is
shipped
to
his
representative
then
it
becomes
an
intrastate
sale,
any
subsequent
sale
made
by
the
producer
representative
or
by
a
producer,
his
employee.
but
if
the
transaction
is
one
in
interstate
commerce,
this
court
has
recognized
the
right
of
a
state
to
tax
the
net
income
resulting
from
that
transaction
provided
that
that
tax
is
an
apportioned
tax
which
bears
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
act
--
relationship
to
the
activities
within
the
state.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
the
technicalities
of
the
paper
are
not
the
important
points
that
i
would
like
to
emphasis
in
this
case.
it
is
the
fact
that
the
title,
the
right,
the
ownership
and
the
possession
of
the
goods
are
retained
by
the
producer
so
long
as
they
are
in
south
carolina.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor
that
is
correct.
it's
the
actual
activities
of
heublein
in
the
state
which
bare
out
the
right
of
the
state
to
impose
it's
tax
on
that
income
produced
in
the
state.
we
are
not
concerned
with
that.
i
think
we
get
law
--
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that
statement.
mr.
g.
lewis
argoe,
jr.
i
say
we
have
the
statue,
yes,
have
required
the
activities
to
be
become
so
localized
as
to
exceed
the
minimum
standards
for
protection
set
out
in
public
law
86-272.
