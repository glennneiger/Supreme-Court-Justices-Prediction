justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
permit
import
of
the
liquor
to
be
shipped
directly
to
the
distributor,
physically?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
--
and
the
only
thing
different
was
the
papers
read
in
the
representative's
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
producer
representative
actually
have
to
go
to
the
distributor
or
it
was
a
paper
just
sent
to
him
and
he
endorsed
them
over
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
who
submits
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
forwards
them
by
mail
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
representative
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
the
distributor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
law
though
requires,
that
--
the
law
doesn't
require
in
any
instance
that
the
liquor
actually
be
delivered
physically
to
the
person
--
to
the
producer
representative?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it
doesn't
break
the
law,
if
the
liquor
is
physically
delivered
to
the
distributor's
warehouse
rather
than
to
the
producer
representative
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
does
a
common
carrier
know
where
it
is
delivered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that
but
how
does
he
know
where
did
he
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
common
carrier
knows
what
warehouse
to
deliver?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
to
know
that.
that
just
happens
to
be
the
distributor's
warehouse?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
what
does
he
do
on
the
phone
he
is
told
that,
yeah,
by
the
distributor?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
one
of
his
addresses.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
facilitate
his
whole
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
what
does
he
do?
now
when
i
get
there,
he
knows
they
have
arrived
and
so
he
takes
the
papers
and
does
what
with
them,
endorsed
them
over
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
does
he
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
he
get
the
certificate?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
requiring
that
last
--
justice
byron
r.
white
supplied
in
advance
to
him
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
supplying
all
that
he
fills
it
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
and
it
isn't
signed
by
the
state
afterwards,
it's
already
signed
in
advance?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
fills
out
the
form
and
then
takes
it
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
basis
you
would
--
if
south
carolina
had
the
same
regulation
with
respect
to
groceries
or
meat,
they
might
be
invalid
under
some
of
the
provision
of
the
constitution,
but
it
would
still
be
out
from
under
the
tax
--
you
would
still
have
the
right
to
tax
it
because
the
federal
statute
wouldn't
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
liquor
business
is
just
different,
is
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
same
scheme
with
that
was
respect
to
anything
but
liquor
would
be
very
questionable,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
other
property
you
would
say
that
commerce
clause
would
prevent
south
carolina
from
the
requiring
tittle
to
pass
inside
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
looking
for
then
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
title
passed
in
south
carolina?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
title
passed
in
south
carolina
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
every
any
other
product
then
you
would
say
south
carolina
couldn't
impose
those
requirements
of
making
title
passage
to
south
carolina.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
prohibiting
acceptance
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
you,
if
in
connection
with
meat,
the
producer
ships
in
into
his
representative
in
the
state
and
that
the
--
and
there
is
exactly
the
same
procedure
gone
through
here
when
connected
with
meat
as
happens
here
in
connection
with
liquor,
you
would
say
that
the
federal
tax
statue
would
control
there
wouldn't
you,
even
though
title
passed
in
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
state
erected
any.
i
am
just
saying
the
producer
happen
to
run
his
business
that
way.
he
just
ships
it
into
his
representative
but
the
only
thing
he
does
is
ship
it
in
to
the
representative,
and
the
representative
immediately
delivers
it
to
the
distributor?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
he
then
not
--
would
he
then
be
subject
to
south
carolina
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
that
was
not
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
yes,
south
carolina
could
tax
such
transaction?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
the
shipment
with
representative
rather
than
directly
to
the
distributor?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
can
tax
--
say
you
send
the
papers
to
a
bank
instead
of
to
the
producer
representative
in
order
to
facilitate
credit
transaction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
permit
import
of
the
liquor
to
be
shipped
directly
to
the
distributor,
physically?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
--
and
the
only
thing
different
was
the
papers
read
in
the
representative's
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
producer
representative
actually
have
to
go
to
the
distributor
or
it
was
a
paper
just
sent
to
him
and
he
endorsed
them
over
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
who
submits
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
forwards
them
by
mail
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
representative
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
the
distributor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
law
though
requires,
that
--
the
law
doesn't
require
in
any
instance
that
the
liquor
actually
be
delivered
physically
to
the
person
--
to
the
producer
representative?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it
doesn't
break
the
law,
if
the
liquor
is
physically
delivered
to
the
distributor's
warehouse
rather
than
to
the
producer
representative
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
does
a
common
carrier
know
where
it
is
delivered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that
but
how
does
he
know
where
did
he
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
common
carrier
knows
what
warehouse
to
deliver?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
to
know
that.
that
just
happens
to
be
the
distributor's
warehouse?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
what
does
he
do
on
the
phone
he
is
told
that,
yeah,
by
the
distributor?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
one
of
his
addresses.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
facilitate
his
whole
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
what
does
he
do?
now
when
i
get
there,
he
knows
they
have
arrived
and
so
he
takes
the
papers
and
does
what
with
them,
endorsed
them
over
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
does
he

justice

where
does
he
get

justice
byron
