the

finding
favorable
to

did
the
supreme
court
pass
on
that
or
treated
in
anyway
or
it
just
ignored
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
but
isn't
the
ordinary
rule
that
when
a
judgment
comes
here
from
a
state
court
that
all
presumptions
are
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
suppose
why
then
the
lower
court's
findings
that
were
favorable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
piga,
even
if
you
are
right
as
to
the
broad
sweep
of
the
federal
statute
in
the
matters
not
dealing
with
liquor,
doesn't
the
twenty-first
amendment
the
least
arguably
out
some
limitations
on
the
power
of
congress
to
sweep
that
broadly
when
they
are
dealing
with
liquor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
piga
supposing
that
south
carolina
instead
of
just
as
you
contend
requiring
checkpoints
had
required
heublein
to
establish
a
warehouse
in
south
carolina?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
i
thought
some
sort
of
separate
storage
or
the
bins
within
the
warehouse
or
or
i
am
mistaken
in
thinking
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
this
case
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
this
case
was
it
shipped
to
the
wholesaler's
warehouse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
argoe,
isn't
the
state's
contention
here
basically
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
it
the
authority
to
regulate
the
way
liquor
distributors
and
sellers
organize
their
business
within
the
state
and
as
a
result
of
those
regulations,
the
way
that
heublein
conducted
it's
business
here
is
in
fact,
outside
the
scope
of
the
federal
commerce
act
