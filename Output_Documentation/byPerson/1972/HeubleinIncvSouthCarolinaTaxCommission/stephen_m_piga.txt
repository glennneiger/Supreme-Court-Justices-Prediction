mr.
stephen
m.
piga
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
introduce
co-counsel
croft
jennings
from
columbia,
south
carolina
and
my
associate
counsel
paul
rooney,
also
from
new
york
city.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
the
decision
in
that
court
unanimously
reversed
the
trial
court
and
upheld
the
position
of
the
state
tax
commission.
justice
lewis
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case.
there
are
five
principal
parties
involved
directly
or
indirectly
in
this
proceeding.
heublein
inc.
is
a
connecticut
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
and
distributing
alcoholic
beverages
and
other
products
throughout
united
states.
the
appellee
is
the
south
carolina
tax
commission,
a
branch
of
the
south
carolina
state.
the
distilled
spirits
institute,
a
trade
association
of
the
producers
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
united
states
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
preliminary
proceedings
before
this
court.
the
multistate
tax
commission
and
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
have
filed
amicus
briefs
in
support
of
south
carolina's
position.
this
case
involves
the
application
of
the
interstate
income
tax
law,
public
law
86-272
to
the
corporate
income
tax
laws
of
south
carolina.
the
text
of
the
federal
statute
is
set
forth
on
page
30
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
read
the
principal
provisions
of
this
statute.
section
381
(a)
and
i
quote
with
some
omissions,
"no
state
shall
have
power
to
impose
a
net
income
tax
on
the
income
derived
within
such
state
by
any
person
from
interstate
commerce
if
the
only
business
activities
within
such
state
by
such
person
or
the
solicitation
of
orders
by
such
person,
or
his
representative,
in
state
for
sale
of
tangible
personal
property,
which
orders
are
sent
outside
the
state
for
approval
or
rejection,
and,
if
approved,
are
filled
by
shipment
or
delivery
from
a
point
outside
the
state.”
the
statute
seems
really
clear.
the
heublein's
position
that
its
activities
in
south
carolina
were
protected
by
the
statute.
thereby
rendering
heublein
immune
from
south
carolina
income
tax.
the
lower
court
proceedings
involved
two
important
questions.
the
court
of
common
pleas
decided
first,
that
the
so
called
voluntary
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
which
consisted
of
its
usual
business
solicitation
and
promotional
activities
did
not
violate,
did
not
exceed
the
minimum
activities
permitted
by
the
federal
statute.
the
lower
court
also
held,
this
was
after
trial
and
testimony,
that
the
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
which
were
mandated
by
the
south
carolina
alcoholic
beverage
control
laws
did
not
exceed
the
minimum
permitted
by
the
federal
statute.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
did
not
disturb
the
trial
court's
finding
on
voluntary
activities.
it
left
standing
the
conclusion
that
heublein's
voluntary
activities
in
south
carolina
did
not
exceed
the
minimum
permitted
by
the
federal
statute.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
held
that
the
activities
of
heublein
which
were
mandated
by
south
carolina's
abc
laws,
were
sufficient
to
localize
its
business
in
south
carolina
and
thereby
render
the
application
of
the
federal
statute
to
it
no
longer
effective.
thus
the
sole
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
heublein's
compliance
with
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
deprive
heublein
of
the
protection
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
there
was
no
discussion
of
it
at
all
in
the
opinion.
but
this
was
a
factual
determination
i
believe
on
the
trial
court's
record
after
testimony
had
been
taken
so
that
this
factual
conclusion
of
the
trial
court
not
being
discussed
passed
upon
or
changed
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
was
left
standing.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
i
would
think
sir
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
particular
proceeding
is
to
consider
the
federal
question
and
the
substantial
federal
question
involved
in
the
mandated
activities
required
by
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
and
that
the
factual
conclusions
of
whether
heublein's
representative
carrying
promotional
materials
from
this
retail
account
to
another
retail
account
would
not
be
the
substantial
federal
question
that
should
concern
this
court.
now
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
i
think
it
is
important
in
the
overall
view
of,
the
overall
picture
of
this
particular
case.
although
we
will
get
into
and
we
will
discuss
exactly
what
the
local
activities
of
heublein
were
that
consisted
of
the
so
called
voluntary
activities.
that
would
all
be
a
part
of
the
record
of
this
case
and
it
would
be
discussed
today.
now
i
went
to
that
right
now.
if
i
may,
heublein
is
a
connecticut
corporation.
it
produces
alcoholic
beverages
in
hartford
and
elsewhere
and
distributes
its
products
throughout
the
us
and
in
south
carolina.
its
best
known
product
is
smirnoff
vodka.
heublein
is
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
south
carolina
and
has
no
office
there.
it
has
no
warehouse
there.
it
has
no
stock
of
goods
in
south
carolina.
its
contact
with
south
carolina
is
through
a
local
representative,
a
so
called
missionary
man
who
calls
on
retail
accounts,
liquor
stores,
clubs,
hotels
in
the
promotion
of
heublein
products.
heublein
is
not
permitted
to
sell
directly
to
retail
accounts
in
south
carolina,
by
reason
of
the
application
of
south
carolina
abc
laws.
thus
heublein's
local
representative
is
not
permitted
to
be
a
salesman
of
alcoholic
products
in
south
carolina.
however,
he
did
on
occasion
brief
the
distributor's
salesman,
the
distributor
being
the
sole
outlet
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
for
the
distribution
of
its
goods.
all
orders
for
heublein's
products
came
from
a
distributor,
primarily
one
distributor.
these
were
sent
by
the
distributor
to
heublein's
office
in
hartford
for
acceptance
or
rejection
there.
all
orders
were
filled
by
shipments,
by
common
carrier
from
goods
maintained
in
inventory
outside
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
these
are
really
the
limits
of
the
so
called
voluntary
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina.
we
believe
that
these
activities
are
clearly
protected
by
the
federal
statute
and
at
the
trial
court
so
held
after
hearing
testimony,
not
only
of
the
local
representative
but
of
the
south
carolina
witnesses.
this
holding
as
i
said
before
has
not
disturbed
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
this
court
to
understand
the
whole
factual
picture.
now
we
come
to
the
activities
of
heublein
which
were
mandated
by
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
and
which
it
would
apply
to
any
non-south
carolinian
store
whether
he
had
any
contact
in
south
carolina
or
no
contact
within
south
carolina.
these
requirements
are
set
forth
on
sections
4-131
to
4-150
of
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
which
appear
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
beginning
at
page
32.
if
i
may,
it's
not
necessarily
today
for
the
court
to
read
8
pages
of
abc
laws
but
i
think
i
can
summarize
the
important
points
fairly
quickly.
first,
the
producer
must
register
with
the
state
tax
commission.
the
producer
must
also
register
a
local
representative,
a
producer's
representative
with
the
state
tax
commission.
this
local
representative
must
be
a
citizen
and
resident
of
south
carolina.
the
producer
must
also
register
it's
brands
with
the
state
tax
commission.
all
shipments
of
liquor
coming
out
of
state
must
be
consigned
in
the
name
of
the
local
producer's
representative.
a
copy
of
each
invoice
and
bill
of
lading
must
be
sent
to
the
state
tax
commission
at
the
time
of
each
out
of
state
shipment.
when
the
goods
arrive
in
south-carolina
the
producer's
representative
must
deliver
to
the
state
tax
commission
another
copy
of
the
bill
of
lading
and
the
invoice.
he
obtains
then
a
certificate
of
transfer
from
the
state
tax
commission
and
it's
only
after
these
steps
are
taken
and
completed,
may
the
producer's
representative
in
south
carolina
complete
the
delivery
and
transfer
of
the
shipping
documents
and
title
papers
to
the
wholesaler,
to
the
purchaser
in
this
particular
transaction
even
though
in
many
cases,
the
liquor
itself
is
already
on
the
premises
of
the
wholesaler
distributor.
these
are
the
mandated
activities.
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
these
are
the
activities
which
resulted
in
converting
inter-state
sales
into
intra-state
sales.
these
are
requirements
which
the
highest
court
of
south
carolina,
and
i
quote
“preclude
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
south
carolina
through
inter-state
sales.”
these
are
the
mandated
activities
which
prevent
the
application
of
the
federal
statute
to
heublein
in
the
view
of
the
south
carolina
tax
commission
and
it's
highest
court.
now
we
concede
here
that
heublein
complied
with
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina.
we
concede
that
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
required
the
producer
to
retain
the
technical
ownership
and
technical
title
of
it's
products
until
it
complies
in
south
carolina
with
the
abc
laws.
we
also
concede
that
the
technical
passage
of
title
to
it's
products
occurs
in
south
carolina
when
the
shipping
papers
are
endorsed
over
to
the
purchaser,
the
wholesaler
distributor
in
south
carolina.
now
again,
we
should
take
another
look
at
the
federal
statute.
the
federal
statute
which
i
quote
says,
“no
state
shall
impose
a
net
income-tax
on
income
derived
from
inter-state
commerce.
if
the
only
business
activities
of
the
solicitation
orders
sent
outside
the
state
for
approval
and
if
approved
are
filled
by
shipment
or
delivery
from
a
point
outside
the
state.”
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
the
federal
statute
expressly
applies,
if
heublein's
income
is
derived
from
inter-state
commerce
and
if
the
shipments
or
deliveries
are
made
from
a
point
outside
the
state.
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
state
of
facts
which
is
closer
to
the
protection
of
the
federal
statute
than
this
case.
heublein
accepts
it's
goods,
accepts
these
orders
in
hartford.
the
inventory
of
heublein
is
maintained
outside
of
south
carolina,
generally
in
hartford.
the
goods
are
shipped
from
connecticut
in
most
cases
directly
to
south
carolina.
they
are
earmarked
for
a
particular
purchase
order
which
has
been
approved
and
confirmed
by
the
producer
in
hartford.
these
transactions
are
clearly
an
inter-state
commerce.
however,
the
appellate,
south
carolina
claims
the
affirmation
of
it's
highest
court
that
the
transfer
of
legal
ownership
has
a
technical
title
in
south
carolina
as
required
by
it's
own
abc
laws,
is
sufficient
to
change
these
inter-state
transactions
into
intra-state
transactions.
the
basis
for
this
conclusion
is
that
there
is
no
shipment
or
delivery
from
out
of
state
because
the
goods
are
still
owned
by
the
producer
when
they
arrive
in
the
state.
it
would
hardly
seem
necessary
to
go
beyond
plain
meaning
of
the
federal
statute
to
reject
this
argument.
however,
there
is,
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
the
federal
statute,
it
seems
clearly
to
have
been
put
to
rest
by
the
senate
committee
report.
the
senate
committee
report
rejected
any
state
imposed
point
of
sale
tests
in
the
application
of
the
federal
statute.
if
i
may
again
quote,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful.
this
is
senate
committee
report
number
658
from
the
86th
congress,
first
session,
“the
committee
understands
that
the
formulas
currently
in
use
are
complex.
that
even
within
the
formulas
the
meaning
of
the
basic
words
are
inexact
and
that
for
example
many
of
the
35
income-tax
states
used
a
different
definition
to
cover
the
term
sale.”
it
understands
that
a
'sale'
maybe
a
considered
to
have
taken
place
according
to
these
definitions
in
any
of
these
locations.
in
the
place
where
the
buyer
and
seller
met,
in
the
place
where
the
goods
were
manufactured,
in
the
place
where
the
goods
were
stored,
in
the
place
where
the
transaction
was
finally
approved,
in
the
place
where
the
selling
company
was
domiciled
or
in
the
place
where
the
goods
were
shipped,
this
lack
of
uniformity
creates
the
possibility
that
each
of
a
number
of
different
states
may
regard
the
same
sale
as
having
occurred
in
it,
depending
upon
the
particular
definition
of
sale
under
it's
own
tax
laws.
each
of
several
different
states
treat
the
same
sale
as
attributable
to
it
because
of
it's
own
definition
of
sale,
it
is
apparent
that
income
from
the
same
sale
maybe
attributed
to
each
of
the
states
under
whose
law
the
same
sale
is
to
be
attributed.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
clear
rejection
by
congress
of
any
place
of
sale
test,
particularly
where
the
place
of
sale
is
determined
by
the
particular
state
or
the
courts
of
that
state.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
there
have
been
conflicts
raised
in
the
past
between
the
twenty-first
amendment,
abc
laws
generated
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
other
federal
statutes.
if
you
recognize
here
that
there
is
a
potential
conflict
now
between
the
federal
statute,
we
are
talking
about
the
inter-state
income
tax
act
and
the
abc
laws
which
are
regulations
based
on
the
twenty-first
amendment
then
i
think
all
of
the
precedents
that
have
been
come
before
the
courts
has
decided
clearly
that
the
federal
statute
or
federal
law
prevails.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
no
it's
not
exactly
correct
sir.
the
goods,
at
the
time
the
goods
are
appropriated
to
the
order
--
located
are
outside
and
they
are
shipped
at
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
well,
they
are
consigned
to
the
producer's
representative
in
south
carolina.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
actually
in
practice
the
trucks
are
unloaded
outside
of
the
wholesaler's
warehouse.
they
are
unloaded
into
the
warehouse
of
the
wholesaler.
there
maybe
separate
bins,
but
i
think
that
is
immaterial.
you
are
right
that
at
that
time,
at
the
time
of
delivery
in
south
carolina,
the
goods
still
belong
to
the
producer
and
in
that
limited
sense
you
can
say
that
the
producer
maintains
a
stock
of
goods.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
no
i
think
that
the
senate
--
well
the
statute
itself
is
talking
about
shipment
or
delivery
from
out
of
state
to
in-state.
we
claim
that
we
clearly
have
that.
we
claim
too
that
the
requirement
here
that
the
goods
come
to
rest
for
an
instance,
for
an
instance
in
south
carolina
is
merely
in
this
essence
a
checking
point,
a
point
at
which
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
well,
it's
the
end
of
the
case
if
you
interpret
delivery
or
shipment
in
the
terms
that
the
court
of
south
carolina
has
interpreted.
we
say
that
delivery
or
shipment
is
a
continuing
thing,
the
goods
are
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
that's
correct.
but
if
there
is
in
fact
a
conflict
here
between
the
federal
statute
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
or
of
any
statutes
of
--
the
state
statutes
based
on
the
twenty-first
amendment,
this
court
has
decided
in
jamerson
versus
(inaudible)
back
in
1938,
that
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
prevails
over
any
challenge
based
on
a
twenty-first
amendment.
in
1944,
the
sixth
circuit
upheld
the
emergency
price
control
act
at
42,
in
the
face
of
a
challenge
based
on
a
twenty-first
amendment.
in
us
versus
frankfort
distilleries
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
but
it's
using
the
authority
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
with
respect
to
a
state
statute,
or
the
twenty-first
amendment
itself
in
challenge
to
a
federal
statute.
now,
the
most
recent
case
on
this
particular
point
is
the
idlewild
liquor
case
in
new
york.
there
the
abc
laws
of
new
york
again
based
on
the
twenty-first
amendment
were
sought
to
overturn
the
application
of
the
federal
tariff
act
in
1930.
and
in
1963,
this
court
upheld
the
federal
tariff
act
notwithstanding
that
type
of
a
challenge.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
if
there
is
a
federal
policy
embodied
in
a
federal
statute,
and
if
in
fact
you
find
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
state
law
whether
it'd
be
based
on
a
twenty-first
amendment
or
any
other
regulatory
power
that
the
federal
statute
clearly
is
supreme
and
takes
precedence
over
this.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
the
beam
case?
that
was
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
the
beam
case
is,
the
court
is
correct,
but
in
fact
that
case
over
turned
the
connecticut
--
the
kentucky
tax
laws
even
though
the
kentucky
tax
laws
were
based
again
on
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
but
the
court
is
dictum.
the
holding
in
that
court
was
again
that
the
export,
import
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
id
it
were
not
a
dictum?
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
well,
the
court
went
on
hold
in
that
case
that
the
state
statute
fell
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
the
dictum
is
helpful
to
the
opposition.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
but
the
whole
thing
i
believe
is
helpful
to
us.
before
concluding,
i
would
like
to
note
that
alcoholic
beverages
are
now
sold
in
all
50
states.
probably
under
more
regulation
than
that
of
any
other
product.
in
1970,
there
were
about
280
million
gallons
of
distilled
spirits
consumed
in
united
states
with
over
five
million
gallons
in
south
carolina
alone.
the
industry
itself
generated
in
1970
about
$7.68
billion
of
revenues
for
the
federal
state
and
local
governments,
including
about
$47
million
in
south
carolina
alone.
these
points
are
used
to
illustrate
that
the
alcoholic
beverage
industry
is
very
important
part
of
commercial
picture
of
the
united
states
and
we
believe
is
should
no
longer
be
single
out
for
discretionary
tax
treatment
based
upon
local
abc
laws
particularly
as
in
this
case
where
all
they
really
do
is
establish
check
points
for
the
purposes
of
a
state
tax.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
should
be
inconceivable
that
that
type
of
law
should
be
used
overturn
a
national
tax
policy.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
sir,
we
thought
about
that
and
greatly
concerned
about.
for
example
if
heublein
was
required
to
built
a
distillery
in
south
carolina
in
order
to
sell
its
products
in
south
carolina,
we
have
doubts
us
to
the
practicalities,
the
constitutionality
and
the
political
aspects
of
that
type
of
requirement
in
view
of
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
amount
of
revenue
that
were
talking
about
which
is
already
generated
by
the
liquor
business
in
south
carolina.
we
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
would
be.
it's
a
difficult
question
but
i
don't
think
it's
before
this
court
until
it
becomes
politically
and
legally
and
practically,
a
matter
that
has
happened
in
south
carolina.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
no
sir.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
introduce
co-counsel
croft
jennings
from
columbia,
south
carolina
and
my
associate
counsel
paul
rooney,
also
from
new
york
city.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
the
decision
in
that
court
unanimously
reversed
the
trial
court
and
upheld
the
position
of
the
state
tax
commission.
justice
lewis
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case.
there
are
five
principal
parties
involved
directly
or
indirectly
in
this
proceeding.
heublein
inc.
is
a
connecticut
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
and
distributing
alcoholic
beverages
and
other
products
throughout
united
states.
the
appellee
is
the
south
carolina
tax
commission,
a
branch
of
the
south
carolina
state.
the
distilled
spirits
institute,
a
trade
association
of
the
producers
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
united
states
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
preliminary
proceedings
before
this
court.
the
multistate
tax
commission
and
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
have
filed
amicus
briefs
in
support
of
south
carolina's
position.
this
case
involves
the
application
of
the
interstate
income
tax
law,
public
law
86-272
to
the
corporate
income
tax
laws
of
south
carolina.
the
text
of
the
federal
statute
is
set
forth
on
page
30
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
read
the
principal
provisions
of
this
statute.
section
381
(a)
and
i
quote
with
some
omissions,
"no
state
shall
have
power
to
impose
a
net
income
tax
on
the
income
derived
within
such
state
by
any
person
from
interstate
commerce
if
the
only
business
activities
within
such
state
by
such
person
or
the
solicitation
of
orders
by
such
person,
or
his
representative,
in
state
for
sale
of
tangible
personal
property,
which
orders
are
sent
outside
the
state
for
approval
or
rejection,
and,
if
approved,
are
filled
by
shipment
or
delivery
from
a
point
outside
the
state.”
the
statute
seems
really
clear.
the
heublein's
position
that
its
activities
in
south
carolina
were
protected
by
the
statute.
thereby
rendering
heublein
immune
from
south
carolina
income
tax.
the
lower
court
proceedings
involved
two
important
questions.
the
court
of
common
pleas
decided
first,
that
the
so
called
voluntary
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
which
consisted
of
its
usual
business
solicitation
and
promotional
activities
did
not
violate,
did
not
exceed
the
minimum
activities
permitted
by
the
federal
statute.
the
lower
court
also
held,
this
was
after
trial
and
testimony,
that
the
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
which
were
mandated
by
the
south
carolina
alcoholic
beverage
control
laws
did
not
exceed
the
minimum
permitted
by
the
federal
statute.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
did
not
disturb
the
trial
court's
finding
on
voluntary
activities.
it
left
standing
the
conclusion
that
heublein's
voluntary
activities
in
south
carolina
did
not
exceed
the
minimum
permitted
by
the
federal
statute.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
held
that
the
activities
of
heublein
which
were
mandated
by
south
carolina's
abc
laws,
were
sufficient
to
localize
its
business
in
south
carolina
and
thereby
render
the
application
of
the
federal
statute
to
it
no
longer
effective.
thus
the
sole
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
heublein's
compliance
with
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
deprive
heublein
of
the
protection
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
there
was
no
discussion
of
it
at
all
in
the
opinion.
but
this
was
a
factual
determination
i
believe
on
the
trial
court's
record
after
testimony
had
been
taken
so
that
this
factual
conclusion
of
the
trial
court
not
being
discussed
passed
upon
or
changed
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
was
left
standing.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
i
would
think
sir
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
particular
proceeding
is
to
consider
the
federal
question
and
the
substantial
federal
question
involved
in
the
mandated
activities
required
by
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
and
that
the
factual
conclusions
of
whether
heublein's
representative
carrying
promotional
materials
from
this
retail
account
to
another
retail
account
would
not
be
the
substantial
federal
question
that
should
concern
this
court.
now
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
i
think
it
is
important
in
the
overall
view
of,
the
overall
picture
of
this
particular
case.
although
we
will
get
into
and
we
will
discuss
exactly
what
the
local
activities
of
heublein
were
that
consisted
of
the
so
called
voluntary
activities.
that
would
all
be
a
part
of
the
record
of
this
case
and
it
would
be
discussed
today.
now
i
went
to
that
right
now.
if
i
may,
heublein
is
a
connecticut
corporation.
it
produces
alcoholic
beverages
in
hartford
and
elsewhere
and
distributes
its
products
throughout
the
us
and
in
south
carolina.
its
best
known
product
is
smirnoff
vodka.
heublein
is
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
south
carolina
and
has
no
office
there.
it
has
no
warehouse
there.
it
has
no
stock
of
goods
in
south
carolina.
its
contact
with
south
carolina
is
through
a
local
representative,
a
so
called
missionary
man
who
calls
on
retail
accounts,
liquor
stores,
clubs,
hotels
in
the
promotion
of
heublein
products.
heublein
is
not
permitted
to
sell
directly
to
retail
accounts
in
south
carolina,
by
reason
of
the
application
of
south
carolina
abc
laws.
thus
heublein's
local
representative
is
not
permitted
to
be
a
salesman
of
alcoholic
products
in
south
carolina.
however,
he
did
on
occasion
brief
the
distributor's
salesman,
the
distributor
being
the
sole
outlet
of
heublein
in
south
carolina
for
the
distribution
of
its
goods.
all
orders
for
heublein's
products
came
from
a
distributor,
primarily
one
distributor.
these
were
sent
by
the
distributor
to
heublein's
office
in
hartford
for
acceptance
or
rejection
there.
all
orders
were
filled
by
shipments,
by
common
carrier
from
goods
maintained
in
inventory
outside
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
these
are
really
the
limits
of
the
so
called
voluntary
activities
of
heublein
in
south
carolina.
we
believe
that
these
activities
are
clearly
protected
by
the
federal
statute
and
at
the
trial
court
so
held
after
hearing
testimony,
not
only
of
the
local
representative
but
of
the
south
carolina
witnesses.
this
holding
as
i
said
before
has
not
disturbed
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
this
court
to
understand
the
whole
factual
picture.
now
we
come
to
the
activities
of
heublein
which
were
mandated
by
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
and
which
it
would
apply
to
any
non-south
carolinian
store
whether
he
had
any
contact
in
south
carolina
or
no
contact
within
south
carolina.
these
requirements
are
set
forth
on
sections
4-131
to
4-150
of
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
which
appear
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
beginning
at
page
32.
if
i
may,
it's
not
necessarily
today
for
the
court
to
read
8
pages
of
abc
laws
but
i
think
i
can
summarize
the
important
points
fairly
quickly.
first,
the
producer
must
register
with
the
state
tax
commission.
the
producer
must
also
register
a
local
representative,
a
producer's
representative
with
the
state
tax
commission.
this
local
representative
must
be
a
citizen
and
resident
of
south
carolina.
the
producer
must
also
register
it's
brands
with
the
state
tax
commission.
all
shipments
of
liquor
coming
out
of
state
must
be
consigned
in
the
name
of
the
local
producer's
representative.
a
copy
of
each
invoice
and
bill
of
lading
must
be
sent
to
the
state
tax
commission
at
the
time
of
each
out
of
state
shipment.
when
the
goods
arrive
in
south-carolina
the
producer's
representative
must
deliver
to
the
state
tax
commission
another
copy
of
the
bill
of
lading
and
the
invoice.
he
obtains
then
a
certificate
of
transfer
from
the
state
tax
commission
and
it's
only
after
these
steps
are
taken
and
completed,
may
the
producer's
representative
in
south
carolina
complete
the
delivery
and
transfer
of
the
shipping
documents
and
title
papers
to
the
wholesaler,
to
the
purchaser
in
this
particular
transaction
even
though
in
many
cases,
the
liquor
itself
is
already
on
the
premises
of
the
wholesaler
distributor.
these
are
the
mandated
activities.
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
these
are
the
activities
which
resulted
in
converting
inter-state
sales
into
intra-state
sales.
these
are
requirements
which
the
highest
court
of
south
carolina,
and
i
quote
“preclude
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
south
carolina
through
inter-state
sales.”
these
are
the
mandated
activities
which
prevent
the
application
of
the
federal
statute
to
heublein
in
the
view
of
the
south
carolina
tax
commission
and
it's
highest
court.
now
we
concede
here
that
heublein
complied
with
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina.
we
concede
that
the
abc
laws
of
south
carolina
required
the
producer
to
retain
the
technical
ownership
and
technical
title
of
it's
products
until
it
complies
in
south
carolina
with
the
abc
laws.
we
also
concede
that
the
technical
passage
of
title
to
it's
products
occurs
in
south
carolina
when
the
shipping
papers
are
endorsed
over
to
the
purchaser,
the
wholesaler
distributor
in
south
carolina.
now
again,
we
should
take
another
look
at
the
federal
statute.
the
federal
statute
which
i
quote
says,
“no
state
shall
impose
a
net
income-tax
on
income
derived
from
inter-state
commerce.
if
the
only
business
activities
of
the
solicitation
orders
sent
outside
the
state
for
approval
and
if
approved
are
filled
by
shipment
or
delivery
from
a
point
outside
the
state.”
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
the
federal
statute
expressly
applies,
if
heublein's
income
is
derived
from
inter-state
commerce
and
if
the
shipments
or
deliveries
are
made
from
a
point
outside
the
state.
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
state
of
facts
which
is
closer
to
the
protection
of
the
federal
statute
than
this
case.
heublein
accepts
it's
goods,
accepts
these
orders
in
hartford.
the
inventory
of
heublein
is
maintained
outside
of
south
carolina,
generally
in
hartford.
the
goods
are
shipped
from
connecticut
in
most
cases
directly
to
south
carolina.
they
are
earmarked
for
a
particular
purchase
order
which
has
been
approved
and
confirmed
by
the
producer
in
hartford.
these
transactions
are
clearly
an
inter-state
commerce.
however,
the
appellate,
south
carolina
claims
the
affirmation
of
it's
highest
court
that
the
transfer
of
legal
ownership
has
a
technical
title
in
south
carolina
as
required
by
it's
own
abc
laws,
is
sufficient
to
change
these
inter-state
transactions
into
intra-state
transactions.
the
basis
for
this
conclusion
is
that
there
is
no
shipment
or
delivery
from
out
of
state
because
the
goods
are
still
owned
by
the
producer
when
they
arrive
in
the
state.
it
would
hardly
seem
necessary
to
go
beyond
plain
meaning
of
the
federal
statute
to
reject
this
argument.
however,
there
is,
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
the
federal
statute,
it
seems
clearly
to
have
been
put
to
rest
by
the
senate
committee
report.
the
senate
committee
report
rejected
any
state
imposed
point
of
sale
tests
in
the
application
of
the
federal
statute.
if
i
may
again
quote,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful.
this
is
senate
committee
report
number
658
from
the
86th
congress,
first
session,
“the
committee
understands
that
the
formulas
currently
in
use
are
complex.
that
even
within
the
formulas
the
meaning
of
the
basic
words
are
inexact
and
that
for
example
many
of
the
35
income-tax
states
used
a
different
definition
to
cover
the
term
sale.”
it
understands
that
a
'sale'
maybe
a
considered
to
have
taken
place
according
to
these
definitions
in
any
of
these
locations.
in
the
place
where
the
buyer
and
seller
met,
in
the
place
where
the
goods
were
manufactured,
in
the
place
where
the
goods
were
stored,
in
the
place
where
the
transaction
was
finally
approved,
in
the
place
where
the
selling
company
was
domiciled
or
in
the
place
where
the
goods
were
shipped,
this
lack
of
uniformity
creates
the
possibility
that
each
of
a
number
of
different
states
may
regard
the
same
sale
as
having
occurred
in
it,
depending
upon
the
particular
definition
of
sale
under
it's
own
tax
laws.
each
of
several
different
states
treat
the
same
sale
as
attributable
to
it
because
of
it's
own
definition
of
sale,
it
is
apparent
that
income
from
the
same
sale
maybe
attributed
to
each
of
the
states
under
whose
law
the
same
sale
is
to
be
attributed.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
clear
rejection
by
congress
of
any
place
of
sale
test,
particularly
where
the
place
of
sale
is
determined
by
the
particular
state
or
the
courts
of
that
state.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
there
have
been
conflicts
raised
in
the
past
between
the
twenty-first
amendment,
abc
laws
generated
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
other
federal
statutes.
if
you
recognize
here
that
there
is
a
potential
conflict
now
between
the
federal
statute,
we
are
talking
about
the
inter-state
income
tax
act
and
the
abc
laws
which
are
regulations
based
on
the
twenty-first
amendment
then
i
think
all
of
the
precedents
that
have
been
come
before
the
courts
has
decided
clearly
that
the
federal
statute
or
federal
law
prevails.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
no
it's
not
exactly
correct
sir.
the
goods,
at
the
time
the
goods
are
appropriated
to
the
order
--
located
are
outside
and
they
are
shipped
at
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
well,
they
are
consigned
to
the
producer's
representative
in
south
carolina.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
actually
in
practice
the
trucks
are
unloaded
outside
of
the
wholesaler's
warehouse.
they
are
unloaded
into
the
warehouse
of
the
wholesaler.
there
maybe
separate
bins,
but
i
think
that
is
immaterial.
you
are
right
that
at
that
time,
at
the
time
of
delivery
in
south
carolina,
the
goods
still
belong
to
the
producer
and
in
that
limited
sense
you
can
say
that
the
producer
maintains
a
stock
of
goods.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
no
i
think
that
the
senate
--
well
the
statute
itself
is
talking
about
shipment
or
delivery
from
out
of
state
to
in-state.
we
claim
that
we
clearly
have
that.
we
claim
too
that
the
requirement
here
that
the
goods
come
to
rest
for
an
instance,
for
an
instance
in
south
carolina
is
merely
in
this
essence
a
checking
point,
a
point
at
which
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
well,
it's
the
end
of
the
case
if
you
interpret
delivery
or
shipment
in
the
terms
that
the
court
of
south
carolina
has
interpreted.
we
say
that
delivery
or
shipment
is
a
continuing
thing,
the
goods
are
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
that's
correct.
but
if
there
is
in
fact
a
conflict
here
between
the
federal
statute
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
or
of
any
statutes
of
--
the
state
statutes
based
on
the
twenty-first
amendment,
this
court
has
decided
in
jamerson
versus
(inaudible)
back
in
1938,
that
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
prevails
over
any
challenge
based
on
a
twenty-first
amendment.
in
1944,
the
sixth
circuit
upheld
the
emergency
price
control
act
at
42,
in
the
face
of
a
challenge
based
on
a
twenty-first
amendment.
in
us
versus
frankfort
distilleries
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
but
it's
using
the
authority
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
with
respect
to
a
state
statute,
or
the
twenty-first
amendment
itself
in
challenge
to
a
federal
statute.
now,
the
most
recent
case
on
this
particular
point
is
the
idlewild
liquor
case
in
new
york.
there
the
abc
laws
of
new
york
again
based
on
the
twenty-first
amendment
were
sought
to
overturn
the
application
of
the
federal
tariff
act
in
1930.
and
in
1963,
this
court
upheld
the
federal
tariff
act
notwithstanding
that
type
of
a
challenge.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
if
there
is
a
federal
policy
embodied
in
a
federal
statute,
and
if
in
fact
you
find
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
state
law
whether
it'd
be
based
on
a
twenty-first
amendment
or
any
other
regulatory
power
that
the
federal
statute
clearly
is
supreme
and
takes
precedence
over
this.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
the
beam
case?
that
was
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
the
beam
case
is,
the
court
is
correct,
but
in
fact
that
case
over
turned
the
connecticut
--
the
kentucky
tax
laws
even
though
the
kentucky
tax
laws
were
based
again
on
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
but
the
court
is
dictum.
the
holding
in
that
court
was
again
that
the
export,
import
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
id
it
were
not
a
dictum?
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
well,
the
court
went
on
hold
in
that
case
that
the
state
statute
fell
--
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
the
dictum
is
helpful
to
the
opposition.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
but
the
whole
thing
i
believe
is
helpful
to
us.
before
concluding,
i
would
like
to
note
that
alcoholic
beverages
are
now
sold
in
all
50
states.
probably
under
more
regulation
than
that
of
any
other
product.
in
1970,
there
were
about
280
million
gallons
of
distilled
spirits
consumed
in
united
states
with
over
five
million
gallons
in
south
carolina
alone.
the
industry
itself
generated
in
1970
about
$7.68
billion
of
revenues
for
the
federal
state
and
local
governments,
including
about
$47
million
in
south
carolina
alone.
these
points
are
used
to
illustrate
that
the
alcoholic
beverage
industry
is
very
important
part
of
commercial
picture
of
the
united
states
and
we
believe
is
should
no
longer
be
single
out
for
discretionary
tax
treatment
based
upon
local
abc
laws
particularly
as
in
this
case
where
all
they
really
do
is
establish
check
points
for
the
purposes
of
a
state
tax.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
should
be
inconceivable
that
that
type
of
law
should
be
used
overturn
a
national
tax
policy.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
sir,
we
thought
about
that
and
greatly
concerned
about.
for
example
if
heublein
was
required
to
built
a
distillery
in
south
carolina
in
order
to
sell
its
products
in
south
carolina,
we
have
doubts
us
to
the
practicalities,
the
constitutionality
and
the
political
aspects
of
that
type
of
requirement
in
view
of
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
amount
of
revenue
that
were
talking
about
which
is
already
generated
by
the
liquor
business
in
south
carolina.
we
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
would
be.
it's
a
difficult
question
but
i
don't
think
it's
before
this
court
until
it
becomes
politically
and
legally
and
practically,
a
matter
that
has
happened
in
south
carolina.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
m.
piga
no
sir.
