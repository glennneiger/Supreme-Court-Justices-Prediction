statutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
was
two
felony
that
i
know
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
inconsistent
with
congress
having
said
the
way
you
willfully
file
a
paper
which
you
don’t
swear
to,
it’s
a
misdemeanor
and
when
you
willfully
file
a
paper
which
you
swear
to,
that’s
a
felony.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
think
“willfully”
means
in
the
misdemeanor
section?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
it
did,
you’re
not
using
the
negligence
now,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
you
have
the
negligence
then
what
do
you
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
taking
an
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn’t
that
the
difference
between
the
two
section?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
i
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
–
here
isn't
the
difference
between
the
two
sections?
justice
thurgood
marshall
willfully
file
is,
my
first
question
was
the
difference
between
willfully
file
in
a
piece
of
paper
that
does
purport
to
be
an
oath
and
willfully
filing
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
isn’t
oath.
willfully
would
mean
the
same
in
both
statutes
and
yet
congress
could
make
a
distinction
between
the
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
don’t
think
congress
did
make
that
distinction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
understood
that
the
second
to
misdemeanor
was
limited
to
tax
returns,
it
was
any
tax
information
you
might
give?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
doesn’t
require
an
oath.
