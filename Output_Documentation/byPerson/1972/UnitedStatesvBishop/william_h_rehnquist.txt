mr.
stone,
i
understand
the
respondent
contends
that
another
paradox
is
that
the
government
on
other
occasions
has
urged
much
the
same
construction
of
the
misdemeanor
statute
as
the
respondent
now
urges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
johnston,
just
as
matter
of
english
usage,
i
take
it
willfully
is
an
adverb
and
what
does
it
modify
under
your
construction
of
the
two
statutes
other
than
the
verbs
deliver
or
disclose
in
7207
or
make
and
subscribe
in
7206?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
variations
in
the
definition
of
willfully
that
you
adverted
to
go
to
the
state
of
mind
with
which
one
performs
this
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
under
the
ninth
circuits
construction,
a
person
who
carelessly
or
inadvertently
delivered
a
return
would
be
guilty
which
really
doesn’t
make
much
sense
at
all
if
he
didn’t
actually
intend
to
deliver
the
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
doesn’t
willfully
almost
boil
down
to
whether
or
not
the
act
of
delivery
is
required
to
be
intentional
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
reckless
means
not
actually
intending,
but
grossly
heedless
of
the
consequences
or
something
like
that,
doesn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
how
you
can
describe
someone
driving
recklessly,
but
i
have
great
difficulty
in
seeing
how
you
can
describe
somebody
as
recklessly
delivering
or
disclosing
something
to
the
secretary
knowing
it
to
be
false?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
go
to
his
knowledge
of
falsity,
not
to
the
intentional
character
of
his
actual
filing
of
the
document,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
right.
