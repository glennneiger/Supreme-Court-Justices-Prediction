mr.
j.
richard
johnston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
refer
first
to
the
matter
of
the
barre
which
was
just
mentioned.
now,
that
case
was
one
which
held
in
fact
section
3616
(a)
which
is
the
predecessor
section
to
the
misdemeanor
section
that
we’re
concerned
with
here,
namely
7207,
was
in
fact
coextensive
with
a
felony
section,
but
in
the
following
year
of
1957,
this
court
decided
the
achilli
case
in
which
it
then
held
a
3616
(a)
was
not
applicable
to
income
tax
returns
at
all
and
it
was
not
until
the
code
was
revised
in
1954
and
the
substance
of
3616
(a)
then
came
back
into
the
income
tax
sections
in
the
form
of
7207
with
which
we’re
concerned
today
that
that
section
again
became
applicable
to
income
tax
returns.
and
part
of
a
holding
in
the
sansone
case
says
that
7207
does
apply
to
income
tax
returns.
what
i
should
like
to
do
with
court’s
permission
is
to
deal
first
and
rather
briefly
with
two
of
the
points
that
counsel
has
made
and
then
address
myself
to
what
i
really
consider
to
be
the
heart
of
the
problem
which
is
presented
here.
both
in
the
government’s
brief
and
in
the
argument
today,
the
government
has
argued
that
the
instructions
that
we
requested
in
which
we’re
not
given
by
the
trial
court
were
improper
because
they
stated
a
standard
of
willfulness
in
connection
with
7207,
a
misdemeanor
offense
that
really
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
negligence.
our
answer
to
that
is
really
in
two
parts
i
suppose.
the
first
is
that
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
i
do
not
argue
to
this
court
but
that
is
a
proper
standard
of
willfulness
under
7207
or
under
any
criminal
statute.
it’s
the
standard
that
had
been
adapted
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
which
our
trial
took
place
and
in
framing
proposed
instructions
for
the
trial
judge,
my
aim
necessarily
was
to
propose
instructions
that
would
meet
the
law
as
it
had
been
held
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
i
was
successful
at
least
to
that
extent.
our
position
is,
however,
that
the
question
is
raised
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
is
not
whether
the
instructions
that
we
requested
correctly
stated
the
law,
but
whether
the
instructions
that
were
actually
given
by
the
trial
judge
correctly
stated
the
law.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
under
the
rules
and
under
the
decided
cases,
we’re
not
required
to
propose
instructions
to
the
trial
court.
our
position
is
taken
if
make
timely
objection
to
the
instruction
that
are
given
or
to
the
omission
of
instructions
that
we
think
should
be
given.
if
we
fairly
and
correctly
state
the
ground
for
the
objection,
our
success
or
failure
later
on
should
not
depend
upon
whether
the
instructions
that
we
then
drafted
and
proposed
to
the
trial
judge
meet
the
task
that
this
court
may
finally
determine
to
be
correct.
this
we
think
is
true
under
rule
30
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
also
the
case
of
united
states
versus
english
and
an
excerpt
from
volume
eight
of
moore’s
federal
practice.
so
that
my
position
here
today
is
not
that
the
standard
of
negligence
or
something
that
approaches
negligence
as
it
has
been
formulated
and
applied
in
the
ninth
circuit,
is
necessarily
a
correct
standard
of
willfulness
under
this
misdemeanor
section
or
under
any
misdemeanor
section.
our
position
is
simply
that
the
word
“willfully”
as
used
in
the
two
sections
of
which
we’re
concerned
in
this
case,
namely
7206
and
7207
has
a
different
meaning
in
those
two
sections
and
our
argument
is
that
it
means
something
less
in
7207,
a
misdemeanor
section,
than
it
means
in
7206,
the
felony
section.
and
in
capsule
form,
our
argument
is
that
if
we're
correct
in
that
contention,
then
we
were
entitled
to
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction
and
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
not
to
give
such
an
instruction.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
perhaps
to
all
mr.
chief
justice
but
this
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
they’re
not
necessarily
thinking
i
believe
that
the
word
has
identical
meaning
in
the
two
sections
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
in
the
spies
case,
however
it
is
pronounced,
in
1943
focused
on
length,
referring
back
to
the
older
case
of
murdock
in
which
the
court
in
its
opinion
had
a
long
paragraph
to
the
effect
that
the
word
“willfully”
is
a
word
of
many
meanings
and
as
listed
a
variety
of
meanings
that
maybe
given
to
that
word.
these
are
both
tax
cases,
these
are
both
criminal
tax
prosecutions.
and
in
the
spies
case
is
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
suggested
that
the
word
might
have
different
meanings
with
respect
to
two
portions
of
the
very
same
section.
that
section
at
that
time
was
145
(a)
under
the
1939
code
under
the
present
1954
code
that
becomes
7203
and
the
court
said
that
it
might
mean,
the
court
would
assume
that
perhaps
the
word
meant
something
more
when
connected
with
a
willful
failure
to
pay
than
when
used
in
connection
with
only
a
willful
failure
to
file
a
return.
so
that
i
think
in
a
general
sense
at
least,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
authority
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
the
proposition
first
that
the
word
“willfully”
does
have
different
meanings,
that
it
does
not
invariably
mean
the
same
thing
and
that
it
may
indeed
have
different
meanings
when
used
in
different
sections
relating
to
criminal
tax
offenses.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
i
don’t
say
that
is
necessarily
inconsistent
mr.
justice.
i
didn’t
think
so
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
my
own
position
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
no,
i
agree
with
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
agree
with
the
government
that
the
word
“willfully”
when
used
in
any
criminal
section
should
mean
at
least
intentionally
and
deliberately.
this
i
think
is
a
kind
of
minimum
meaning
for
the
word
willfully.
let
me
suggest
that
the
word
which
we
said
in
our
brief
that
there
are
three
rather
commonly
or
frequently
accepted
meanings
of
the
word
and
perhaps
four.
the
lowest
level
of
culpability
would
be
the
ninth
circuit
definition
of
willfully
in
misdemeanor
cases.
the
definition
is
given
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
this
case
where
they
say
it
may
mean
no
more
than
without
reasonable
cause
or
capriciously
or
with
careless
disregard
of
ones
obligations
or
whether
one
has
the
right
so
to
add,
that
is
a
very
low
level
of
culpability.
the
next
level
up
the
scale
i
should
think
would
be
a
level
which
would
include
at
least
intentional
and
deliberate
action,
and
as
i
have
pointed
out
previously,
i
make
no
argument
for
the
ninth
circuit
level
but
i
think
that
the
word
might
very
well
be
held
to
mean
intentionally
or
deliberately
under
7207
and
then
under
the
felony
section
7206,
the
court
might
hold
as
many
courts
have
held,
many
circuit
courts
that
there
is
an
added
requirement
in
the
felony
section,
not
only
must
the
act
be
done
intentionally
and
deliberately,
but
it
must
be
done
with
a
bad
purpose
or
an
evil
motive,
some
additional
state
of
mind,
some
additional
intent
that
super
impose.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
perhaps
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
the
fact
is
that
in
our
factual
situation
where
we’re
talking
about
income
tax
returns
and
in
any
case
where
we’re
talking
about
tax
returns,
the
other
portions
of
the
law
and
regulations
require
that
the
returns
be
made
under
penalty
of
perjury.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
and
the
declaration
stated
right
on
the
return
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
but
in
the
case
where
we’re
talking
about
income
tax
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
could
mean
the
same,
but
my
argument
to
the
court
is
that
it
should
not
be
construed
by
this
court
to
mean
exactly
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
think
the
court
now
has
the
job
of
deciding
what
congress’
intent
was
and
if
i
may
quote
from
the
court’s
statement
in
the
achilli
case
which
i
think
is
most
appropriate
here,
this
court
said
in
the
achilli
case
in
1957,
“our
duty
is
give
coherence
to
what
congress
has
done
within
the
bounds
imposed
by
a
fair
reading
of
legislation.”
so
here,
we
have
a
group
of
sections
that
fall
in
the
same
portion
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
sections
that
we’re
concerned
is
today
are
two
of
those
sections.
there
are
others
that
precede
and
follow.
my
argument
to
the
court
is
that
in
connection
with
the
filing
of
any
kind
of
a
tax
return
which
is
required
by
other
provisions
of
law
to
be
filed
or
to
be
made
under
penalties
of
perjury
so
that,
that
distinction
doesn't
apply
when
we
are
talking
about
any
tax
return.
it
does
not
make
much
sense
and
it
does
not
result
in
a
rational
construction
and
interrelation
of
these
sections
to
conclude
that
we
have
two
sections
there
in
which
at
least
with
respect
to
tax
returns
prohibit
precisely
the
same
offense
and
yet
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
no
sir,
but
the
case
that
we’re
concerned
with
involve
tax
returns
and
tax
returns
are
required
to
be
made
under
penalty
of
perjury
and
this
court
has
held
that
7207
applies
to
the
filing
of
income
tax
returns
so
that
my
argument
to
the
court
is
that
we
do
not
achieve
the
kind
of
coherence
that
the
court
seeks
to
give
to
acts
of
congress.
if
we
arrive
at
a
conclusion
that
we
have
two
sections
which
at
least
with
respect
to
income
tax
returns
prohibit
precisely
the
same
act
and
in
the
one
case,
the
act
is
punishable
as
a
felony
by
imprisonment
for
not
more
than
three
years
and
a
fine
of
not
more
than
$5000,
and
in
the
other
case,
punishable
only
as
a
misdemeanor
for
the
maximum
punishment
of
one
year
or
$1000.
if
those
two
sections
are
to
be
given
any
kind
of
rational
coherence
as
part
of
a
total
system
of
sanctions
of
which
this
court
has
spoken
in
the
past,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
very
reasonable
to
argue
that
the
difference
must
be
that
the
requirement
of
willfulness
in
the
misdemeanor
section
is
something
less
than
what
is
required
in
the
felony
section.
and
if
this
court
arrives
at
that
conclusion
regardless
of
how
the
term
is
to
be
defined
for
the
two
purposes,
if
it
means
something
less
in
the
misdemeanor
section
than
it
means
in
the
felony
section,
then
my
argument
is
that
mr.
bishop
was
entitled
to
a
jury
instruction
on
the
subject
of
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well
mr.
justice,
i
think
those
are
the
verbs
that
it
modifies
or
describes.
in
7206,
it’s
in
terms
of
any
person
who
willfully
makes
and
subscribes
any
return
in
so
forth.
willfully
describes
or
modifies,
i
take
it
making
and
subscribing.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
precisely.
i
think
when
we
talk
about
willfulness
we
are
talking
only
about
state
a
mind.
we’re
talking
about
intent.
we’re
talking
about
some
degree
of
specific
intent
as
distinguished
from
some
lesser
kind
of
intent
and
that
is
the
whole
question
i
think,
how
this
word
“willfully”
is
to
be
defined
as
a
description
of
someone’s
state
of
mind
at
the
time
they
performed
an
act.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
hope
i
have
made
it
clear,
i
have
some
difficulty
with
that
position
also
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
point
out
that
7207,
the
misdemeanor
section
by
its
language
applies
only
to
returns,
documents
and
so
on
known
by
him
to
be
fraudulent
or
false
so
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
knowledge
that
the
document
is
false
which
is
part
of
that
section.
and
the
word
“willfully”
then,
i
take
it,
describes
the
state
of
mind
of
the,
or
the
additional
state
of
mind
perhaps
of
the
taxpayer
when
he
files
his
return.
the
requirement
of
knowledge
is
in
that
section
regardless
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
willfully.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
i
think
that
is
the
question
and
my
suggestion
is
that
perhaps
any
definition
in
terms
of
intentional
action
is
a
proper
definition
of
the
term
in
this
misdemeanor
section.
there
is
another
word
that
might
be
suggested
which
i
think
the
courts
have
not
used
particularly,
but
one
might
define
the
term
somehow
in
terms
of
recklessness
or
recklessly
doing
something.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
perhaps
it’s
only
a
kind
of
gross
negligence.
we
get
degrees
of
meaning
there.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
let
me
suggest
a
possible
factual
situation
which
might
indeed
have
been
the
situation
here.
a
person
prepares
a
tax
return
using
in
part
information
that
someone
else
has
worked
up,
that
was
the
situation
here.
mr.
bishop
used
lists
of
itemized
expenditures
and
then
the
total
of
that
list
was
put
into
the
return
as
a
deduction
for
farm
expense.
conceptually,
his
state
of
mind
may
have
been
that
although
he
did
not
check
through
the
list
and
he
testified
that
he
did
not
and
he
did
not
go
through
and
identify
each
item
which
was
in
the
list,
he
might
have
well
had
some
reason
to
suspect
that
there
were
items
in
that
list
that
were
not
properly
deductible
and
yet
without
checking
it
out,
without
determining
whether
the
list
contained
only
deductible
items,
he
nevertheless
put
the
total
amount
into
return
and
took
the
deduction.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
mr.
justice,
when
i
use
the
term
recklessly,
i
mean
perhaps
that
he
proceeded
without
taking
some
further
steps
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
accuracy
or
inaccuracy
of
the
return
which
perhaps
he
should
have
taken.
to
me,
that
is
a
kind
of
recklessness.
maybe
it’s
not
a
very
good
word
but
i
suggested
as
a
possible
one
at
least.
a
reference
has
been
made
to
the
sansone
case.
i’ve
difficulty
to
some
of
these
cases,
and
i’m
never
quite
sure
how
these
gentlemen
pronounced
their
own
names.
the
sansone
case
is
one
which
of
course
the
court
must
consider
and
obviously,
it
posses
some
problems
for
us.
sansone
was
a
case
where
the,
in
the
first
place
where
the
taxpayer
was
charged
under
7201,
which
is
a
felony
section,
the
section
that
used
to
be
used
mostly
i
think
attempted
evasion,
a
willful
attempt
to
evade
or
defeat
tax
or
the
payment
thereof.
that
is
not
the
section
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
so
that
there
is
at
least
that
basis
of
distinction,
the
felony
section
that
we
are
dealing
here,
the
7206.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
requested
instructions
to
the
jury
that
they
might
find
him
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense
under
either
7203
on
the
basis
of
a
failure
to
file,
a
willful
failure
to
file
which
is
a
misdemeanor
or
7207
which
is
the
misdemeanor
section
that
we’re
concerned
with
here,
namely
filing
of
false
return.
the
strict
holding
of
the
case,
oh,
let
me
state
another
fact.
prior
to
the
trial
apparently
when
the
taxpayer
was
being
examined
by
the
agents,
he
had
explained
that
he
had
capital
gain
on
some
sales
of
land
that
he
knew
he
knew
he
had
to
gain
and
that
he
deliberately
did
not
include
the
gain
in
his
returns
because,
i
am
going
to
start
again.
at
the
trial,
this
was
his
explanation,
that
he
had
the
gain,
that
he
deliberately
omitted
it
from
the
returns
because
he
thought
that
he
didn’t
have
the
money
to
pay
the
tax
and
he
intended
at
a
later
date
to
report
the
gain
and
pay
the
tax.
that
was
one
explanation.
another
explanation
he
had
made
was
that
he
anticipated
some
expenses
in
connection
with
a
creek
that
bothered
the
property
he
had
sold
and
it
was
his
thought
that
those
expenses
might
very
well
offset
the
gain
on
the
sale
so
that
he
would
wind
up
without
any
gain.
and
the
precise
holding
of
the
sansone
case
as
i
understand
it,
is
simply
that
the
explanation
that
he
intended
to
report
the
gain
and
pay
the
tax
at
a
future
date
would
not
vitiate
willfulness
and
this
is
the
court’s
term
under
any
of
the
three
sections.
the
court
said
“that’s
not
a
defense.
that
does
not
negative
willfulness
under
any
of
the
three,
7201,
7203,
or
7207.”
now,
the
court
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
went
on
to
make
a
statement
which
i
think
is
strictly
dictum,
but
which
quite
frankly
gives
us
some
difficulty
in
which
mr.
goldberg
apparently
assumed
that
the
meaning
of
willfulness
was
the
same
in
each
of
these
three
sections
and
also
that
the
meaning
of
willfulness
was
to
be
equated
simply
with
knowledge.
this
is
done
without
any
discussion
of
the
argument,
the
kind
of
argument
or
the
issue
that
we
raise
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
to
suggest
that
this
issue
that
we
now
raise
was
ever
briefed
or
fully
considered
by
the
court
in
the
sansone
case
beyond
what’s
in
the
opinion,
i
don’t
know
for
a
fact
what
happened,
but
that
language
is
troublesome.
and
i
think
at
least
the
apparent
assumption
that
the
word
“willfully”
meant
simply
knowledge
is
contrary
to
a
great
deal
of
other
law
in
this
area
where
the
word
“willfully”
at
least
in
the
felony
sections
has
been
held
to
involve
not
only
knowledge
or
deliberate
action,
intentional
action,
but
also
this
additional
state
of
mind
which
involves
a
bad
purpose
or
an
evil
motive
and
i
think
that
the,
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
law
on
this
point
badly
needs
to
be
clarified.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
think
it
badly
needs
to
be
clarified
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
but
here
mr.
justice,
we
have
the
precise
question
as
to
what
it
means
in
these
two
particular
sections
and
i
think
at
least,
it
has
to
be
clarified
to
what
extent.
we
feel
that
the
spies
case
helps
us
because
in
spies,
the
court
held
that
it
would
not
reasonably
conclude
that
the
commission
of
a
misdemeanor
or
failure
to
file
plus
the
misdemeanor
of
failure
to
pay
together
without
anything
more
constituted
a
felony
of
willful
attempt
to
evade
a
defeat.
and
the
court
went
on
then
to
speak
not
in
terms
of
the
meaning
of
willful,
but
in
terms
of
the
meaning
a
willful
attempt
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“attempt”
because
the
real
holding
of
the
spies
case
is
that
in
addition
to
a
willful
failure
to
file
and
a
willful
failure
to
pay,
both
of
which
are
misdemeanors,
there
must
be
some
further
acts,
some
affirmative
act
which
meets
the
court’s
definition
of
a
willful
attempt.
in
most
of
the
cases
that
we
have,
that
willful
attempt
consists
in
filing
a
false
tax
return,
that
is
the
act.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
and
of
course
our
argument
to
the
court
is
that
it
means
different
things
and
the
misdemeanor
as
it
means
in
the
felony
section
and
that
only
by
giving
it
a
different
meaning,
the
court
really
rationalized
these
sections.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
that
was
the
court’s
holding.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
said
in
that
case
the
taxpayer
was
not
entitled,
to
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
but
then
the
next
year
in
achilli,
this
court
held
that
the
misdemeanor
section
that
was
involved
there,
616
(a)
under
the
1939
code,
actually
did
not
apply
to
income
tax
violations
and
that
ruling
was
explained
in
sansone
on
the
ground
in
part
that
this
court
would
not
presume
that
congress
would
enact
two
sections
covering
the
same
area,
one
of
which
is
a
felony
and
one
of
which
is
a
misdemeanor
and
it
was
subsequent
to
achilli
then
that,
that
section
was
re-enacted
in
7207
in
the
1954
code
and
although
one
might
have
suspected
at
that
point
that
it
started
or
forgotten
section
that
somehow
congress
really
wasn’t
focusing
on
it,
it’s
important
to
know
i
think
that
the
section
was
subsequently
amended
by
congress
in
1963,
7207
was
amended
by
adding
the
entire
second
half
of
what
now
appears
in
that
section,
it
was
subsequently
amended
still
further
by
a
further
amendment
to
that
portion
of
the
section.
so,
it’s
definitely
there.
it's
definitely
part
of
some
kind
of
a
total
system
of
sanctions.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
it
is
the
successor
to
the
section
involved
in
achilli.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
it
was
changed
by
removing
the
language
about
attempt
to
evade
or
defeat
which
had
originally
appeared
in
3616
(a),
so
that
was
taken
out
and
then
the
section
was
moved
in
to
the
income
tax
sections
were
it
now
is
in
the
code
and
in
sansone,
this
court
held
that
it
applied
to
income
tax
cases.
so
there
is
no
question
about
its
applicability
and
the
only
question
then
is
if
both
of
these
sections
prohibit
the
filing
of
false
returns
and
make
criminal
offenses
of
the
filing
of
false
returns,
does
the
word
willfully
have
an
identical
meaning
in
both
sections.
and
if
it
does
not,
if
it
means
something
less
than
the
misdemeanor
that
it
means
in
the
felony,
then
we
say,
we
were
entitled
to
have
the
instruction
and
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
regardless
of
whether
this
court
agrees
with
the
particular
definition
of
the
ninth
circuit
as
given
to
the
word
generally
in
tax
misdemeanor
sections.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
refer
first
to
the
matter
of
the
barre
which
was
just
mentioned.
now,
that
case
was
one
which
held
in
fact
section
3616
(a)
which
is
the
predecessor
section
to
the
misdemeanor
section
that
we’re
concerned
with
here,
namely
7207,
was
in
fact
coextensive
with
a
felony
section,
but
in
the
following
year
of
1957,
this
court
decided
the
achilli
case
in
which
it
then
held
a
3616
(a)
was
not
applicable
to
income
tax
returns
at
all
and
it
was
not
until
the
code
was
revised
in
1954
and
the
substance
of
3616
(a)
then
came
back
into
the
income
tax
sections
in
the
form
of
7207
with
which
we’re
concerned
today
that
that
section
again
became
applicable
to
income
tax
returns.
and
part
of
a
holding
in
the
sansone
case
says
that
7207
does
apply
to
income
tax
returns.
what
i
should
like
to
do
with
court’s
permission
is
to
deal
first
and
rather
briefly
with
two
of
the
points
that
counsel
has
made
and
then
address
myself
to
what
i
really
consider
to
be
the
heart
of
the
problem
which
is
presented
here.
both
in
the
government’s
brief
and
in
the
argument
today,
the
government
has
argued
that
the
instructions
that
we
requested
in
which
we’re
not
given
by
the
trial
court
were
improper
because
they
stated
a
standard
of
willfulness
in
connection
with
7207,
a
misdemeanor
offense
that
really
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
negligence.
our
answer
to
that
is
really
in
two
parts
i
suppose.
the
first
is
that
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
i
do
not
argue
to
this
court
but
that
is
a
proper
standard
of
willfulness
under
7207
or
under
any
criminal
statute.
it’s
the
standard
that
had
been
adapted
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
which
our
trial
took
place
and
in
framing
proposed
instructions
for
the
trial
judge,
my
aim
necessarily
was
to
propose
instructions
that
would
meet
the
law
as
it
had
been
held
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
i
was
successful
at
least
to
that
extent.
our
position
is,
however,
that
the
question
is
raised
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
is
not
whether
the
instructions
that
we
requested
correctly
stated
the
law,
but
whether
the
instructions
that
were
actually
given
by
the
trial
judge
correctly
stated
the
law.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
under
the
rules
and
under
the
decided
cases,
we’re
not
required
to
propose
instructions
to
the
trial
court.
our
position
is
taken
if
make
timely
objection
to
the
instruction
that
are
given
or
to
the
omission
of
instructions
that
we
think
should
be
given.
if
we
fairly
and
correctly
state
the
ground
for
the
objection,
our
success
or
failure
later
on
should
not
depend
upon
whether
the
instructions
that
we
then
drafted
and
proposed
to
the
trial
judge
meet
the
task
that
this
court
may
finally
determine
to
be
correct.
this
we
think
is
true
under
rule
30
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
also
the
case
of
united
states
versus
english
and
an
excerpt
from
volume
eight
of
moore’s
federal
practice.
so
that
my
position
here
today
is
not
that
the
standard
of
negligence
or
something
that
approaches
negligence
as
it
has
been
formulated
and
applied
in
the
ninth
circuit,
is
necessarily
a
correct
standard
of
willfulness
under
this
misdemeanor
section
or
under
any
misdemeanor
section.
our
position
is
simply
that
the
word
“willfully”
as
used
in
the
two
sections
of
which
we’re
concerned
in
this
case,
namely
7206
and
7207
has
a
different
meaning
in
those
two
sections
and
our
argument
is
that
it
means
something
less
in
7207,
a
misdemeanor
section,
than
it
means
in
7206,
the
felony
section.
and
in
capsule
form,
our
argument
is
that
if
we're
correct
in
that
contention,
then
we
were
entitled
to
the
lesser
included
offense
instruction
and
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
not
to
give
such
an
instruction.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
perhaps
to
all
mr.
chief
justice
but
this
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
they’re
not
necessarily
thinking
i
believe
that
the
word
has
identical
meaning
in
the
two
sections
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
in
the
spies
case,
however
it
is
pronounced,
in
1943
focused
on
length,
referring
back
to
the
older
case
of
murdock
in
which
the
court
in
its
opinion
had
a
long
paragraph
to
the
effect
that
the
word
“willfully”
is
a
word
of
many
meanings
and
as
listed
a
variety
of
meanings
that
maybe
given
to
that
word.
these
are
both
tax
cases,
these
are
both
criminal
tax
prosecutions.
and
in
the
spies
case
is
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
suggested
that
the
word
might
have
different
meanings
with
respect
to
two
portions
of
the
very
same
section.
that
section
at
that
time
was
145
(a)
under
the
1939
code
under
the
present
1954
code
that
becomes
7203
and
the
court
said
that
it
might
mean,
the
court
would
assume
that
perhaps
the
word
meant
something
more
when
connected
with
a
willful
failure
to
pay
than
when
used
in
connection
with
only
a
willful
failure
to
file
a
return.
so
that
i
think
in
a
general
sense
at
least,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
authority
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
the
proposition
first
that
the
word
“willfully”
does
have
different
meanings,
that
it
does
not
invariably
mean
the
same
thing
and
that
it
may
indeed
have
different
meanings
when
used
in
different
sections
relating
to
criminal
tax
offenses.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
i
don’t
say
that
is
necessarily
inconsistent
mr.
justice.
i
didn’t
think
so
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
my
own
position
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
no,
i
agree
with
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
agree
with
the
government
that
the
word
“willfully”
when
used
in
any
criminal
section
should
mean
at
least
intentionally
and
deliberately.
this
i
think
is
a
kind
of
minimum
meaning
for
the
word
willfully.
let
me
suggest
that
the
word
which
we
said
in
our
brief
that
there
are
three
rather
commonly
or
frequently
accepted
meanings
of
the
word
and
perhaps
four.
the
lowest
level
of
culpability
would
be
the
ninth
circuit
definition
of
willfully
in
misdemeanor
cases.
the
definition
is
given
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
this
case
where
they
say
it
may
mean
no
more
than
without
reasonable
cause
or
capriciously
or
with
careless
disregard
of
ones
obligations
or
whether
one
has
the
right
so
to
add,
that
is
a
very
low
level
of
culpability.
the
next
level
up
the
scale
i
should
think
would
be
a
level
which
would
include
at
least
intentional
and
deliberate
action,
and
as
i
have
pointed
out
previously,
i
make
no
argument
for
the
ninth
circuit
level
but
i
think
that
the
word
might
very
well
be
held
to
mean
intentionally
or
deliberately
under
7207
and
then
under
the
felony
section
7206,
the
court
might
hold
as
many
courts
have
held,
many
circuit
courts
that
there
is
an
added
requirement
in
the
felony
section,
not
only
must
the
act
be
done
intentionally
and
deliberately,
but
it
must
be
done
with
a
bad
purpose
or
an
evil
motive,
some
additional
state
of
mind,
some
additional
intent
that
super
impose.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
perhaps
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
the
fact
is
that
in
our
factual
situation
where
we’re
talking
about
income
tax
returns
and
in
any
case
where
we’re
talking
about
tax
returns,
the
other
portions
of
the
law
and
regulations
require
that
the
returns
be
made
under
penalty
of
perjury.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
and
the
declaration
stated
right
on
the
return
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
but
in
the
case
where
we’re
talking
about
income
tax
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
could
mean
the
same,
but
my
argument
to
the
court
is
that
it
should
not
be
construed
by
this
court
to
mean
exactly
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
think
the
court
now
has
the
job
of
deciding
what
congress’
intent
was
and
if
i
may
quote
from
the
court’s
statement
in
the
achilli
case
which
i
think
is
most
appropriate
here,
this
court
said
in
the
achilli
case
in
1957,
“our
duty
is
give
coherence
to
what
congress
has
done
within
the
bounds
imposed
by
a
fair
reading
of
legislation.”
so
here,
we
have
a
group
of
sections
that
fall
in
the
same
portion
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
sections
that
we’re
concerned
is
today
are
two
of
those
sections.
there
are
others
that
precede
and
follow.
my
argument
to
the
court
is
that
in
connection
with
the
filing
of
any
kind
of
a
tax
return
which
is
required
by
other
provisions
of
law
to
be
filed
or
to
be
made
under
penalties
of
perjury
so
that,
that
distinction
doesn't
apply
when
we
are
talking
about
any
tax
return.
it
does
not
make
much
sense
and
it
does
not
result
in
a
rational
construction
and
interrelation
of
these
sections
to
conclude
that
we
have
two
sections
there
in
which
at
least
with
respect
to
tax
returns
prohibit
precisely
the
same
offense
and
yet
--
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
no
sir,
but
the
case
that
we’re
concerned
with
involve
tax
returns
and
tax
returns
are
required
to
be
made
under
penalty
of
perjury
and
this
court
has
held
that
7207
applies
to
the
filing
of
income
tax
returns
so
that
my
argument
to
the
court
is
that
we
do
not
achieve
the
kind
of
coherence
that
the
court
seeks
to
give
to
acts
of
congress.
if
we
arrive
at
a
conclusion
that
we
have
two
sections
which
at
least
with
respect
to
income
tax
returns
prohibit
precisely
the
same
act
and
in
the
one
case,
the
act
is
punishable
as
a
felony
by
imprisonment
for
not
more
than
three
years
and
a
fine
of
not
more
than
$5000,
and
in
the
other
case,
punishable
only
as
a
misdemeanor
for
the
maximum
punishment
of
one
year
or
$1000.
if
those
two
sections
are
to
be
given
any
kind
of
rational
coherence
as
part
of
a
total
system
of
sanctions
of
which
this
court
has
spoken
in
the
past,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
very
reasonable
to
argue
that
the
difference
must
be
that
the
requirement
of
willfulness
in
the
misdemeanor
section
is
something
less
than
what
is
required
in
the
felony
section.
and
if
this
court
arrives
at
that
conclusion
regardless
of
how
the
term
is
to
be
defined
for
the
two
purposes,
if
it
means
something
less
in
the
misdemeanor
section
than
it
means
in
the
felony
section,
then
my
argument
is
that
mr.
bishop
was
entitled
to
a
jury
instruction
on
the
subject
of
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well
mr.
justice,
i
think
those
are
the
verbs
that
it
modifies
or
describes.
in
7206,
it’s
in
terms
of
any
person
who
willfully
makes
and
subscribes
any
return
in
so
forth.
willfully
describes
or
modifies,
i
take
it
making
and
subscribing.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
precisely.
i
think
when
we
talk
about
willfulness
we
are
talking
only
about
state
a
mind.
we’re
talking
about
intent.
we’re
talking
about
some
degree
of
specific
intent
as
distinguished
from
some
lesser
kind
of
intent
and
that
is
the
whole
question
i
think,
how
this
word
“willfully”
is
to
be
defined
as
a
description
of
someone’s
state
of
mind
at
the
time
they
performed
an
act.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
hope
i
have
made
it
clear,
i
have
some
difficulty
with
that
position
also
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
point
out
that
7207,
the
misdemeanor
section
by
its
language
applies
only
to
returns,
documents
and
so
on
known
by
him
to
be
fraudulent
or
false
so
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
knowledge
that
the
document
is
false
which
is
part
of
that
section.
and
the
word
“willfully”
then,
i
take
it,
describes
the
state
of
mind
of
the,
or
the
additional
state
of
mind
perhaps
of
the
taxpayer
when
he
files
his
return.
the
requirement
of
knowledge
is
in
that
section
regardless
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
willfully.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
i
think
that
is
the
question
and
my
suggestion
is
that
perhaps
any
definition
in
terms
of
intentional
action
is
a
proper
definition
of
the
term
in
this
misdemeanor
section.
there
is
another
word
that
might
be
suggested
which
i
think
the
courts
have
not
used
particularly,
but
one
might
define
the
term
somehow
in
terms
of
recklessness
or
recklessly
doing
something.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
perhaps
it’s
only
a
kind
of
gross
negligence.
we
get
degrees
of
meaning
there.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
let
me
suggest
a
possible
factual
situation
which
might
indeed
have
been
the
situation
here.
a
person
prepares
a
tax
return
using
in
part
information
that
someone
else
has
worked
up,
that
was
the
situation
here.
mr.
bishop
used
lists
of
itemized
expenditures
and
then
the
total
of
that
list
was
put
into
the
return
as
a
deduction
for
farm
expense.
conceptually,
his
state
of
mind
may
have
been
that
although
he
did
not
check
through
the
list
and
he
testified
that
he
did
not
and
he
did
not
go
through
and
identify
each
item
which
was
in
the
list,
he
might
have
well
had
some
reason
to
suspect
that
there
were
items
in
that
list
that
were
not
properly
deductible
and
yet
without
checking
it
out,
without
determining
whether
the
list
contained
only
deductible
items,
he
nevertheless
put
the
total
amount
into
return
and
took
the
deduction.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
well,
mr.
justice,
when
i
use
the
term
recklessly,
i
mean
perhaps
that
he
proceeded
without
taking
some
further
steps
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
accuracy
or
inaccuracy
of
the
return
which
perhaps
he
should
have
taken.
to
me,
that
is
a
kind
of
recklessness.
maybe
it’s
not
a
very
good
word
but
i
suggested
as
a
possible
one
at
least.
a
reference
has
been
made
to
the
sansone
case.
i’ve
difficulty
to
some
of
these
cases,
and
i’m
never
quite
sure
how
these
gentlemen
pronounced
their
own
names.
the
sansone
case
is
one
which
of
course
the
court
must
consider
and
obviously,
it
posses
some
problems
for
us.
sansone
was
a
case
where
the,
in
the
first
place
where
the
taxpayer
was
charged
under
7201,
which
is
a
felony
section,
the
section
that
used
to
be
used
mostly
i
think
attempted
evasion,
a
willful
attempt
to
evade
or
defeat
tax
or
the
payment
thereof.
that
is
not
the
section
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
so
that
there
is
at
least
that
basis
of
distinction,
the
felony
section
that
we
are
dealing
here,
the
7206.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
requested
instructions
to
the
jury
that
they
might
find
him
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense
under
either
7203
on
the
basis
of
a
failure
to
file,
a
willful
failure
to
file
which
is
a
misdemeanor
or
7207
which
is
the
misdemeanor
section
that
we’re
concerned
with
here,
namely
filing
of
false
return.
the
strict
holding
of
the
case,
oh,
let
me
state
another
fact.
prior
to
the
trial
apparently
when
the
taxpayer
was
being
examined
by
the
agents,
he
had
explained
that
he
had
capital
gain
on
some
sales
of
land
that
he
knew
he
knew
he
had
to
gain
and
that
he
deliberately
did
not
include
the
gain
in
his
returns
because,
i
am
going
to
start
again.
at
the
trial,
this
was
his
explanation,
that
he
had
the
gain,
that
he
deliberately
omitted
it
from
the
returns
because
he
thought
that
he
didn’t
have
the
money
to
pay
the
tax
and
he
intended
at
a
later
date
to
report
the
gain
and
pay
the
tax.
that
was
one
explanation.
another
explanation
he
had
made
was
that
he
anticipated
some
expenses
in
connection
with
a
creek
that
bothered
the
property
he
had
sold
and
it
was
his
thought
that
those
expenses
might
very
well
offset
the
gain
on
the
sale
so
that
he
would
wind
up
without
any
gain.
and
the
precise
holding
of
the
sansone
case
as
i
understand
it,
is
simply
that
the
explanation
that
he
intended
to
report
the
gain
and
pay
the
tax
at
a
future
date
would
not
vitiate
willfulness
and
this
is
the
court’s
term
under
any
of
the
three
sections.
the
court
said
“that’s
not
a
defense.
that
does
not
negative
willfulness
under
any
of
the
three,
7201,
7203,
or
7207.”
now,
the
court
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
went
on
to
make
a
statement
which
i
think
is
strictly
dictum,
but
which
quite
frankly
gives
us
some
difficulty
in
which
mr.
goldberg
apparently
assumed
that
the
meaning
of
willfulness
was
the
same
in
each
of
these
three
sections
and
also
that
the
meaning
of
willfulness
was
to
be
equated
simply
with
knowledge.
this
is
done
without
any
discussion
of
the
argument,
the
kind
of
argument
or
the
issue
that
we
raise
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
to
suggest
that
this
issue
that
we
now
raise
was
ever
briefed
or
fully
considered
by
the
court
in
the
sansone
case
beyond
what’s
in
the
opinion,
i
don’t
know
for
a
fact
what
happened,
but
that
language
is
troublesome.
and
i
think
at
least
the
apparent
assumption
that
the
word
“willfully”
meant
simply
knowledge
is
contrary
to
a
great
deal
of
other
law
in
this
area
where
the
word
“willfully”
at
least
in
the
felony
sections
has
been
held
to
involve
not
only
knowledge
or
deliberate
action,
intentional
action,
but
also
this
additional
state
of
mind
which
involves
a
bad
purpose
or
an
evil
motive
and
i
think
that
the,
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
law
on
this
point
badly
needs
to
be
clarified.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
think
it
badly
needs
to
be
clarified
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
but
here
mr.
justice,
we
have
the
precise
question
as
to
what
it
means
in
these
two
particular
sections
and
i
think
at
least,
it
has
to
be
clarified
to
what
extent.
we
feel
that
the
spies
case
helps
us
because
in
spies,
the
court
held
that
it
would
not
reasonably
conclude
that
the
commission
of
a
misdemeanor
or
failure
to
file
plus
the
misdemeanor
of
failure
to
pay
together
without
anything
more
constituted
a
felony
of
willful
attempt
to
evade
a
defeat.
and
the
court
went
on
then
to
speak
not
in
terms
of
the
meaning
of
willful,
but
in
terms
of
the
meaning
a
willful
attempt
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“attempt”
because
the
real
holding
of
the
spies
case
is
that
in
addition
to
a
willful
failure
to
file
and
a
willful
failure
to
pay,
both
of
which
are
misdemeanors,
there
must
be
some
further
acts,
some
affirmative
act
which
meets
the
court’s
definition
of
a
willful
attempt.
in
most
of
the
cases
that
we
have,
that
willful
attempt
consists
in
filing
a
false
tax
return,
that
is
the
act.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
and
of
course
our
argument
to
the
court
is
that
it
means
different
things
and
the
misdemeanor
as
it
means
in
the
felony
section
and
that
only
by
giving
it
a
different
meaning,
the
court
really
rationalized
these
sections.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
that
was
the
court’s
holding.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
said
in
that
case
the
taxpayer
was
not
entitled,
to
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
but
then
the
next
year
in
achilli,
this
court
held
that
the
misdemeanor
section
that
was
involved
there,
616
(a)
under
the
1939
code,
actually
did
not
apply
to
income
tax
violations
and
that
ruling
was
explained
in
sansone
on
the
ground
in
part
that
this
court
would
not
presume
that
congress
would
enact
two
sections
covering
the
same
area,
one
of
which
is
a
felony
and
one
of
which
is
a
misdemeanor
and
it
was
subsequent
to
achilli
then
that,
that
section
was
re-enacted
in
7207
in
the
1954
code
and
although
one
might
have
suspected
at
that
point
that
it
started
or
forgotten
section
that
somehow
congress
really
wasn’t
focusing
on
it,
it’s
important
to
know
i
think
that
the
section
was
subsequently
amended
by
congress
in
1963,
7207
was
amended
by
adding
the
entire
second
half
of
what
now
appears
in
that
section,
it
was
subsequently
amended
still
further
by
a
further
amendment
to
that
portion
of
the
section.
so,
it’s
definitely
there.
it's
definitely
part
of
some
kind
of
a
total
system
of
sanctions.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
it
is
the
successor
to
the
section
involved
in
achilli.
mr.
j.
richard
johnston
it
was
changed
by
removing
the
language
about
attempt
to
evade
or
defeat
which
had
originally
appeared
in
3616
(a),
so
that
was
taken
out
and
then
the
section
was
moved
in
to
the
income
tax
sections
were
it
now
is
in
the
code
and
in
sansone,
this
court
held
that
it
applied
to
income
tax
cases.
so
there
is
no
question
about
its
applicability
and
the
only
question
then
is
if
both
of
these
sections
prohibit
the
filing
of
false
returns
and
make
criminal
offenses
of
the
filing
of
false
returns,
does
the
word
willfully
have
an
identical
meaning
in
both
sections.
and
if
it
does
not,
if
it
means
something
less
than
the
misdemeanor
that
it
means
in
the
felony,
then
we
say,
we
were
entitled
to
have
the
instruction
and
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
regardless
of
whether
this
court
agrees
with
the
particular
definition
of
the
ninth
circuit
as
given
to
the
word
generally
in
tax
misdemeanor
sections.
