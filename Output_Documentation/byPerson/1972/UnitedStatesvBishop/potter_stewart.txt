stewart
which
is
what?
justice
potter
stewart
not
analytically
but
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
comment
over
the
years
but
that
is
precisely
the
function
of
a
jury,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
at
least
that
this
is
a
precise
aspect
of
the
basic
function
of
a
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
does
have
the
court
of
appeals
going
for
him?
justice
potter
stewart
willfully
and
misdemeanor
makes
something
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
it’s
not
a
misdemeanor
felony
to
that
account?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the,
did
you
rely
on
the
berra
case?
justice
potter
stewart
b
e
r
r
a,
i
guess
it’s
pronounced
berra,
in
which
apparently
the
same
elements
were
eventually
needed.
he
could’ve
been
charged
under
the
misdemeanor
or
the
felony,
but
he
was
charged
under
the
felony
and
the
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
harlan
said
that
the
court
was
not
required
to
charge
him
on
the
lesser
offense
even
though
they
apparently
covered
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
the
same
appear
in
much
longer
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know
but
all
two
justices
is
trying
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
boiled
down
and
analyzed,
this
simply
upheld
prosecutorial
discretion
didn’t
it,
the
barre
case?
justice
potter
stewart
although
it’s
not
put
in
quite
for
those
terms?
justice
potter
stewart
if
anything,
it
helps
you.
justice
potter
stewart
attacking
that.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it
can
be
clarified
much
beyond
what
was
said
in
that
case
several
years
ago
at
spies
or
spies,
like
you,
i
don’t
know
how
this
people
really
pronounce
the
names?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
point
is,
willfulness,
that
means
variety
of
different
things
depending
on
its
content,
isn’t
it?
is
that
all
you
can
say,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
sometimes
willful
can
just
mean
purposeful
or
not
accidental
and
other
times
it
imports,
it’s
been
mens
rea
and
it
really,
it
always
depends
on
the
context?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
barre?
there
was
a
misdemeanor
statute
and
a
felony
statute
that
everybody
seem
to
agree
covered
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
section
involved
in
achilli?
justice

yes.
