mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
tax
case
which
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
state
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
indicted
in
the
eastern
district
of
california
on
the
charge
of
willfully
filing
income
tax
returns
which
he
did
not
believe
to
be
true
as
to
every
material
matter,
an
offense
punishable
as
a
felony
under
section
7206
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
elements
of
the
offense
defined
in
section
7206
(1)
are
that
the
defendant
willfully
makes
and
subscribes
a
document,
that
the
document
be
verified
under
the
penalty
of
perjury
and
that
the
defendant
does
not
believe
the
document
to
be
true
and
correct
as
to
every
material
matter.
the
evidence
introduced
at
respondent’s
trial
showed
that
the
respondent
was
a
practicing
attorney
who
owned
a
walnut
ranch
which
was
managed
by
his
step
mother.
during
the
three
years
in
issue,
1963
to
1965
inclusive,
respondent
sent
his
step
mother
weekly
checks
which
she
deposited
in
a
bank
account
for
purposes
of
covering
the
operating
expenses
of
respondent’s
ranch.
though
there
was
evidence
of
several
different
types
of
improper
deductions
claimed
by
respondent
on
his
tax
return,
the
crux
of
the
offense
charged
against
respondent
was
that
he
took
deductions
twice
for
these
operating
expenses
of
the
ranch.
what
he
did
was,
he
deducted
both
the
amounts
which
he
sent
to
his
stepmother
and
in
addition,
the
amounts
paid
by
her
out
of
those
very
same
funds
to
cover
the
ranch’s
expenses.
now,
respondent’s
defense
at
trial
and
the
really
only
matter
essentially
in
dispute
in
the
transcript
to
this
case
focused
primarily
on
his
claim
that
he
had
no
knowledge
that
the
deductions
were
false
and
consequently,
that
he
did
not
have
the
requisite
intent,
whatever
that
is
and
we
shall
discuss
that
at
great
length,
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
under
7206
(1)
which
as
i
indicated
requires
that
the
defendant
commit
the
prohibited
act
willfully.
in
addition
however,
the
respondent
requested
that
the
jury
be
instructed
that
it
could
find
him
innocent
of
the
felony
set
forth
in
7206
(1),
but
guilty
of
what
respondent
argued
was
the
lesser
included
offense
of
delivering
to
the
revenue
service
a
document
known
to
be
false
or
fraudulent
which
is
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor
under
section
7207
of
the
code,
which
respondent
argued
requires
a
lesser
degree
of
willfulness
than
does
the
felony
charged.
the
trial
judge
refused
respondent’s
request
to
charge
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
could
find
him
guilty
of
the
lesser
included
misdemeanor
and
respondent
was
indeed
found
guilty
as
charged
of
the
felony.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
held
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
the
lesser
included
offense
charge
for
which
reason
it
did
not
reach
other
issues
raised
on
appeal
by
respondent,
and
it
is
from
this
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
requiring
a
retrial
with
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
that
the
government
has
sought
certiorari
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
question
in
this
case
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
which
i
think
the
answer
is
quite
simple.
it
is
certainly
is
an
anomaly
at
first
glance
with
respect
to
that.
the
answer
i
think
is
that
7206,
the
felony
covers
only
documents
which
are
signed
by
the
taxpayer,
by
the
defendant
under
penalty
of
perjury,
where
as
the
misdemeanor
offense
refers
simply
to
any
document
including
for
example
a
work
sheet
handed
to
a
revenue
agent
and
of
course
of
an
audit
or
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
an
income
tax
return,
if
properly
filed,
and
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury.
there
is
an
overlap
between
the
two
offenses
insofar
as
the
misdemeanor
also
applies
to
documents
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury
but
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
more
severe
--
the
distinction
with
respect
severity
of
penalty
is
attributable
to
the
fact
that
one
section
refers
exclusively
to
documents
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury
and
that
is
a
reflection
of
a
historical
concept
that
a
document
so
signed
represents
a
more
serious
representation
and
probably
in
itself
a
more
greater
consciousness
of
affect
of
the
filing
of
the
document
than
thus
simply
handing
for
example
a
worksheet
to
a
revenue
agent.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right,
that
is
right,
it
could
be.
there
is
an
overlapping
element
and
which
i
think
we
are
forced
to
conclude
leaves
a
certain
amount
of
prosecutorial
discretion.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yeah,
the
practice
is
ordinarily
i
am
told
with
respect
to
income
tax
returns
to
prosecute
for
the
felony,
but
that
is
--
there
is
the
discretion
exercised
and
what
you
would
expect
to
be
the
factors
playing
into
such
a
discretion
or
use.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
by
the
individual
us
attorney
presumably
in
consultation
with
the
fraud
section
of
the
tax
division
and
the
internal
revenue
service.
let
me
point
out
that
the
discretion
is
actually
not
quite
as
the
prosecutorial
discretion
involved
in
this
overlap
of
offenses.
it's
not
quite
as
great
as
it
seems
to
be,
because
there
is
no
minimum
penalty
set
forth
in
the
felony
provision,
and
there
is
of
course
somewhat
higher
maximum
penalty
both
with
respect
to
imprisonment
and
to
fine,
but
there
is
no
minimum
penalty
so
that
sentencing
judge
really
is
left
with
the
great
bulk
of
the
discretion
to
determine
what
punishment
to
impose
and
in
this
case
for
example,
at
least
the
prison
sentence
was
well
below
the
maximum
for
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
certainly.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
certainly,
yes,
that
is
right.
well,
to
return
to
the
matter
of
lesser
included
offense,
rule
31
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
the
defendant
maybe
found
guilty
of
an
offense
“necessarily
included
in
the
offense
charged.”
now,
either
the
prosecution
or
the
defendant
may
request
that
a
charge
of
lesser
included
offense
be
given.
the
prosecution
may
want
the
lesser
included
offense
charged
for
the
rather
obvious
reason
that
it
may
think
that
the
jury
could
find
the
evidence
insufficient
to
support
the
greater
offense
charged,
but
sufficient
to
support
a
lesser
included
offense.
the
defendant’s
reasons
for
wanting
the
charge
of
somewhat
more
subtle
and
complex,
although
i
think
and
as
a
practical
matter
readily
apparent,
one
might
think
that
the
defendant
would
reason
that
if
the
jury
were
to
find
him
innocent
of
the
greater
offense,
it
would
to
his,
the
defendant’s
advantage
not
to
leave
the
jury
with
a
lesser
alternative
ground
for
conviction,
but
in
practice,
it
appears
that
in
many
cases,
the
defendants
feel
that
it
works
to
their
advantage
for
the
court
to
give
the
jury
a
range
of
offenses
varying
in
severity
of
which
the
defendant
maybe
convicted
and
i
suppose
quite
frankly,
the
underlying
assumption
of
that
is
that
the
jury
may
for
reasons
not
entirely
related
to
factual
determinations
that
it
is
supposed
to
make
in
the
case,
conclude
that
it
would
prefer
to
see
the
defendant
punished
with
a
lesser
offense
which
is
not
really
properly
within
the
jury’s
domain.
let
me
state
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
not
really
entirely,
analytically,
but
what
the
function
of
the
jury
is
supposed
to
be
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
don’t—
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
there
maybe
opinion
to
that
effect
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
all
the
law
on
lesser
included
offense
and
with
this,
i
think
that
the
respondent
does
not
anywhere
disagree
nor
did
the
court
below
disagree,
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
is
very
precisely
designed
to
avoid
presenting
the
jury
with
a
situation
in
which
it
has
to
and
makes
a
choice
on
a
non
factual
determination.
let
me
state
at
the
outset
that
though
it
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
the
government
and
respondent
are
in
complete
agreement
as
to
every
aspect
of
the
general
contours
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
and
i
shall
refer
to
a
possible
difference
of
opinion
later
on,
with
respect
to
the
key
issue
which
this
case
presents,
i
think
it
is
quite
fair
to
say
that
the
government
and
respondent
are
indeed
in
agreement
as
to
the
general
contours
of
a
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
and
disagree
only
as
to
the
applicability
of
that
doctrine
to
the
specific
felony
and
misdemeanor
offenses
set
forth
in
sections
7206
and
7207.
both
parties
agree
that
if
on
the
basis
of
the
undisputed
facts
in
this
case,
the
jury
could
not
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense
without
also
finding
him
guilty
of
the
greater
offense;
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
is
inapplicable.
in
other
words,
the
doctrine
does
not
apply
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
jury
which
in
fact
finds
the
defendant
guilty
of
both
offenses,
discretion
to
and
or
a
verdict
only
on
the
misdemeanor,
that
is
not
what
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine.
it's
about
regardless
of
what
maybe
argued
should
be
the
jury’s
function
in
other
context.
where
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
does
apply,
however,
is
where
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
might
reasonably
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
the
greater
offense,
but
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense.
consequently
in
this
case,
there
must
be
a
disputed
factual
matter
which
if
resolved
by
the
jury
in
a
certain
way
could
render
the
defendant
innocent
of
the
section
7206
felony,
but
guilty
of
the
section
7207
misdemeanor.
now,
it
is
undisputed
here
that
the
allegedly
fraudulent
documents
were
made
and
subscribed
by
the
defendant
under
penalty
of
perjury,
so
that
that
basic
distinction
in
these
two
statutes
is
not
part
of
the
factual,
underlying
factual
dispute
of
this
case.
what
respondent
does
argue
and
this
is
the
key
problem
in
the
case
is
that
section
7206
uses
the
word
willfully
in
a
sense
different
from
the
way
that
that
word
is
used
in
section
7207.
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
necessary
to
support
conviction
of
the
felony
is
greater
than
that
necessary
to
support
conviction
of
the
misdemeanor
and
consequently,
that
the
jury
could
reasonably
find
that
the
defendant
was
innocent
of
the
felony,
but
guilty
of
the
misdemeanor
on
a
lower
standard
willfulness.
so
that
his
position
depends
essentially
upon
reading
the
word
“willfully”
in
section
7206
to
imply
a
higher
standard
of
culpability,
if
you
will,
a
more
evil
motive
in
that
same
word
implies
in
the
next
section
7207.
and
in
spite
of
a
usual
presumption
that
the
same
word
would
not
be
used
differently
in
two
consecutive
sections
of
the
code
defining
very
closely
related
offenses
in
a
different
manner,
there
is
some
superficial
appeal
to
this
argument
as
i
have
stated
earlier
for
indeed,
it
may
appear
strange
at
first
glance
that
these
two
sections
punish
closely
related
offenses
in
a
different
manner,
unless
there
is
a
higher
degree
of
culpability
in
some
way
necessary
to
support
a
more
severely
punished
offense,
that
is
the
felony.
and
as
i
said,
i
think
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
what
that
distinction
is
based
upon
is
a
historical
distinction
with
some
validity
i
think
in
terms
of
reality
between
fraudulent
submission
of
a
document
under
penalty
of
--
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury
and
simply
a
document
which
is
not
signed
which
is
handed
over
to
an
official
with
the
government
in
administrative
capacity.
now,
having
dealt
with
the
reason
why
this
immediate
anomaly
is
really
only
superficial,
let
me
turn
to
what
i
suggest
is
really
the
overwhelming
reason
and
the
overwhelming
way
in
which
respondent’s
argument
that
willfully
in
section
7207
means
something
less
than
it
does
in
section
7206
is
plainly
contradicted
by
the
language
of
these
two
statutory
provisions.
section
7206,
the
felony
statute
requires
that
the
defendant
willfully
file
a
document
which
“he
does
not
believe
to
be
true
and
correct
as
to
every
material
manner.”
section
7207,
the
misdemeanor
statute
requires
that
the
defendant
willfully
file
a
document
“known
by
him
to
be
fraudulent
or
false
as
to
any
material
matter.”
it
is
difficult
to
understand
on
what
basis
the
court
below
could
have
concluded
and
respondent
can
argue
here
in
this
court
that
a
statute
which
hinges
liability
on
a
finding
merely
that
defendant
did
not
believe
the
documents
to
be
true
could
imply
a
greater
degree
of
willfulness
than
does
a
statute
which
hinges
liability
on
a
finding
that
the
defendant
knew
in
fact
that
the
documents
were
false
and
fraudulent.
indeed,
if
either
of
these
sections
implies
a
higher
standard
of
willfulness
or
evil
motive,
it
must
be
the
misdemeanor
statute
which
requires
knowledge
that
the
documents
at
issue
are
false.
now,
respondent
argues
in
his
brief
without
explaining
the
basis
of
his
argument
that
these
two
formulations
of
the
defendant’s
state
of
mind
are
basically
the
same
thing,
i.e.
that
not
believing
the
documents
to
be
true
and
knowing
them
to
be
false
are
really
not
meant
to
imply
meaningful
distinction,
and
i
think
there
is
a
rather
significant
irony
to
his
arguing
this
because
he
contends
on
the
one
hand
that
two
very
differently
worded
phrases
implying
to
the
average
reader
quite
a
different
meaning
and
i
think
meaningful
in
many
criminal
statutory
contexts,
that
these
two
very
differently
worded
phrases
used
in
connection
with
closely
related
offenses
in
consecutive
statutory
sections
are
intended
to
mean
the
same
thing.
while
on
the
other
hand,
he
argues
that
the
word
“willfully”
also
used
in
an
identical
manner,
the
same
word
used
identically
in
these
two
provisions
means
something
different
in
each
of
these
two
provisions
and
i
think
that
that’s
a
rather
strained
version
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
has
the
court
of
appeals
going
for
him
mr.
justice
stewart
in
what
i
think
is
a
just
an
explicable
ground
which
is
essentially
that
misdemeanor
us
per
se
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
willfully
and
misdemeanor
means
something
different
from
willfully
in
the
context
of
felonies,
and
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
though
willfully,
the
word
willfully
may
mean
different
things
in
different,
the
context
of
different
factual
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
its
certainly
not,
that
difference
is
certainly
not
based
on
some
arbitrary
distinction
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
is
virtually
all
that
it
says
and
quite
conclusively
in
support
of
its
holding.
furthermore,
apart
from
the
fact
that
if
there
is
any
distinction
at
all
between
the
uses
of
the
word
“willfully”
in
these
two
sections,
the
higher
standard
is
really
under
misdemeanor
which
acquires
knowledge
of
falsity.
let’s
look
at
what
respondent
says
is
the
substantive
meaning
of
willfully
and
the
misdemeanor
charge.
he
claims
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
of
the
misdemeanor
is
satisfied
in
finding
that
the
defendant
acted
capriciously
or
with
a
careless
disregard
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
“that
the
defendant
formed
the
specific
evil
purpose
of
misleading
the
government,”
this
is
the
language
of
his
requested
charge
and
language
basically
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
i
suppose
somewhat
paradoxical
for
the
government
to
be
in
the
position
of
arguing
for
a
higher
standard
of
culpability
than
does
the
defendant
even
with
respect
to
a
charge
that
has
not
been
brought
against
this
particular
defendant,
but
frankly,
we
simply
cannot
square
a
standard
of
careless
or
capricious
behavior
and
a
lack
of
purpose
to
mislead
the
government
with
that
requirement
in
section
7207,
that
the
defendant
willfully
submit
documents
which
he
knows
to
be
false.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
government
has
--
it
is
not
clear
that
the
government
has
ever
urged
in
any
tax
misdemeanor
statute
a
standard
of
mere
carelessness
or
capriciousness
and
we
deal
with
that
in
the
reply
brief
in
some
detail
when
we
replied
ti
his
brief
--
to
his
opposition
to
our
petition,
but
in
any
event,
the
only
statute
which
he
even
claims
that
we
have
ever
applied
a
standard
of
carelessness
or
capriciousness
to
and
the
only
misdemeanor
tax
statute
is
section
7203,
which
deals
with
willful
failure
to
file
required
documents,
a
return
of
filed
documents,
and
an
omission,
a
willful
omission
of
a
required
act
may
involve
a
different
and
lower
standard
of
evil
intent
or
willfulness
than
does
submission
of
a
known
fraudulent
document.
so
that
really,
we
are
not
trying
to
apply
across
the
board
in
any
context
a
universal
standard
of
what
the
word
“willfully”
means.
that
depends
in
each
instance
upon
an
analysis
of
the
factual
background
that
the
statute
is
directed
towards.
indeed,
this
court
has
specifically
rejected
the
argument
that
the
misdemeanor
set
forth
in
section
7207
can
be
committed
merely
by
carelessness
and
without
conscious
knowledge
of
the
wrongfulness
of
the
defendant’s
act.
in
the
sense,
sansone
case
at
380
u.s.,
the
defendant
who
was
tried
for
the
felony
charge
of
willfully
attempting
to
evade
taxes
which
is
defined
in
section
7201
and
he
requested
there
as
he
or
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
to
the
effect
that
he
could
be
convicted
if
it
were
found
that
he
did
not
have
the
requisite
intent
for
the
felony
of
willfully
attempting
to
evade
taxes.
you
could
still
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
one
felony
and
two
misdemeanors
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
the
only
felony
involved
was
7201.
there
were
two
misdemeanors,
i
think
7203,
the
failure
to
file
was
also
involved,
but
i
think
what
he
had
asked
for
in
sansone
was
a
charge
that
instead
of
the
felony,
he
could
be
charged
with
either
of
two
misdemeanors,
but
in
any
event,
i
don’t
think
that’s
important
for
our
purposes
here
because
the
key
issue
in
the
sansone
is
that
the
court
denied
him
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
and
stated
quite
specifically
that
at
least
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
willfulness
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
in
both
the
felony
7201
and
the
very
misdemeanor
at
issue
here
required
some
sort
of
willful
knowledge
and
evil
intent
and
it's
quite,
the
court
quite
specifically
rejected
there
any
notion
that
section
7207
can
be
satisfied
by
a
mere
showing
of
carelessness
or
capriciousness.
furthermore,
i
think
that
the
sansone
opinion
which
was
really
not
dealt
with
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
meaningful
way
precludes
the
ninth
circuit’s
across
the
board
holding
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
in
tax
misdemeanors
is
necessarily
less
than
it
is
for
tax
felonies
because
sansone
said
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
with
respect
that
tax
misdemeanor,
the
one
at
issue
here
and
the
tax
felony
at
issue
there,
were
indeed
exactly
the
same.
finally,
we
make
an
alternative
argument
that
is
related
in
several
respects
to
our
contention
that
the
misdemeanor
in
section
7207
does
not
import
a
lesser
degree
of
willfulness
than
does
the
offense
set
forth
in
7206
but
which
focuses
on
the
applicability
generally
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
itself.
this
is
a
slightly
different
argument
though
based
upon
many
of
the
same
underlying
reasons.
at
common
laws,
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
was
restricted
to
situations
in
which
the
misdemeanor
was
entirely
included
in
the
statute,
that
is
in
which
there
was
no
element
necessary
to
sustain
a
conviction
of
the
lesser
offense
which
was
not
necessary
in
addition
to
sustained
conviction
of
the
greater
offense.
this
strict
version
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
appears
to
have
been
incorporated
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
rule
31
(c)
requires
that
the
defendant
maybe
found
guilty
of
an
offense
necessarily
included
in
the
offense
charged.
now,
there
maybe
in
some
jurisdictions
have
allowed
slight
deviation
from
that
rule
and
respondent
implies
in
his
brief
that
he
feels
that
some
of
the
circuit
courts
have
implied
by
way
of
dicta
that
there
maybe
situations
in
which
the
federal
courts
could
allow
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
even
though
that
could
conceivably
be
circumstances
in
which
the
defendant
could
be
found
guilty
of
the
greater
offense
without
being
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense.
and
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
get
into
the
precise
contours
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine.
i
think
whatever
justification
there
maybe
for
slightly
more
liberal
application
of
that
of
this
doctrine,
it
should
not
be
applicable
here.
for
even
if
contrary
to
our
contention,
the
court
were
to
find
that
the
word
“willfully”
in
section
7206
means
something
more
than
it
does
in
section
7207,
the
misdemeanor
under
section
7207
would
still
not
be
a
lesser
included
offense
within
the
felony
under
section
7206
because
knowledge
of
falsity
is
a
key
element
of
the
misdemeanor,
but
is
not
an
element
of
the
felony.
even
if
willfulness
has
no
relationship
by
some
strange
court
to
the
states
of
mind
that
are
defined
in
these
very
statutes,
it
cannot
be
denied
on
the
language
of
the
statute
that
there
is
an
element,
a
key
element
under
misdemeanor,
an
element
which
was
in
actual
dispute
in
this
case
presents
the
respondent’s
defense
rested
almost
entirely
upon
his
assertion
with
respect
to
his
state
of
mind,
there
is
a
key
element
of
the
misdemeanor
which
is
not
necessary
to
support
the
felony
and
consequently
under
even
a
slightly
more
liberal
reading
than
is
traditional
and
then
is
implied
by
the
federal
rules
of
a
lesser
included
defense
doctrine,
this
offense,
this
misdemeanor
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
within
the
broader
scope
of
this
felony
because
there
is
a
key
element
to
it,
knowledge
of
falsity
that
is
not
necessary
to
support
the
felony.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
berra
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that’s
the
point
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
the
point
here,
but
there
is
a
rather
strong
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
justice
black
and
douglas
i
think
dissented
in
that
case
on
the
ground
that
they
feel
that
a
statute
is
ought
not
to
be
interpreted
if
possible
to
render
the
prosecution
with
any
degree
of
discretion
to
choose
between
which
offense
when
the
underlying
commissions
are
identical.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes
it
did,
it
did.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right
and
that
was
the
ground,
but
that
was
the
ground
that
the
dissent
put
it
on,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
holding
in
that
case
and
the
majority
opinion
in
an
any
way
contradicts
our
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
helps
you,
yes.
it
helps
us,
yes,
and
it
certainly
does
not
contradict
our
assertion
that
and
really,
i
don’t
think
this
in
contention,
i
don’t
respondent
basis
is
argument
at
all
upon
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
--
general
attack
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine.
if
the
two
offenses,
if
it
is
obvious
that
the
two
offenses
have
to
be
identically
determined,
then
there
is,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
is
not
applicable
and
what
justices
black
and
douglas
resented
in
that
case
in
their
dissent
was
that
statutes
are
not
to
be
interpreted
to
overlap
to
too
great
an
extent
because
it
is
improper
for
the
prosecutor
to
have
excessive
discretion
that
is
ordinarily
the
domain
of
the
judge.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right.
what
the
sansone
case
specifically
said
was
that
the
domain
of
the
jury
was
only
to
choose
between
offenses
on
the
basis
of
determining
the
factual
background
that
would
support
one
offense
to
the
other
but
not
to
find
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
both
offenses
and
then
to
go
ahead
and
choose
which
one
to
find
him
guilty
of,
that
is
precisely
what’s
sansone
said.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
that
would
permit
the
jury
to
invade
the
domain
that
is
everyone
agrees
it’s
proper
for
the
judge
and
in
some
circumstances,
it's
proper
within
limited
bounds
for
the
prosecution.
i
would
like
mr.
chief
justice
to
reserve
the
small
amount
of
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
nothing
especially
new
to
say
except
that
to
sum
up.
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is,
i
have
perceived
in
the
course
of
respondent’s
counsel’s
argument
an
underlying
dissatisfaction
with
the
material
involved
in
this
case.
it
is
that
which
i
had
anticipated
and
it
centers
on
the
rather
unsatisfactory
and
illusory
meaning
of
the
word
“willful”
in
the
context
of
all
these
criminal
tax
statutes
and
it
becomes
especially
difficult
to
pinpoint
precisely
what
congress
meant
by
the
word
willful
when
we
deal
as
we
do
here
with
two
statutory
provisions
that
define
the
basic
state
of
mind
required
to
commit
the
offense
entirely
apart
from
using
the
word
willfully.
one
of
these
statutes
defines
the
basic
state
of
mind
involved
in
the
commission
of
the
offense
in
terms
of
lack
of
belief
that
the
knowledge
contain
that
the
document
is
true.
the
other
defines
that
state
of
mind
in
terms
of
a
knowledge
or
falsity
of
the
underlying
information.
i
think
that
the
likelihood
is
that
the
word
willfully
is
probably
close
to
superfluous
in
both
of
this
statutes
since
the
underlying
state
of
mind
is
defined,
but
the
court
needn’t
reach
the
metaphysical
possibilities
of
what
willfully
can
mean
precisely
in
each
of
these
contexts.
it
is
sufficient
for
purposes
of
this
argument
to
observe
that
the
basic
state
of
mind
necessary
to
support
the
misdemeanor
is
a
more
serious
culpable
standard,
knowledge
or
falsity,
then
is
the
state
of
mind
necessary
to
support
the
felony.
and
i’ve
yet
to
perceive
either
from
respondent’s
presentation
or
from
the
court
of
appeals
any
possible
way
of
holding
that
lack
of
belief
can
be
a
greater
culpable
standard
in
itself
and
imply
greater
degree
of
willfulness
than
can
the
knowledge
of
falsity.
i
perceived
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
questions
if
i’m
not
mistaken,
some
possible
attempt
to
focus
the
word
“willfully”
not
on
that
state
of
mind
as
described
in
the
statute,
but
on
the
very
act
of
delivery
or
act
of
making
and
subscribing
itself
and
i
cannot
understand
what
might
be
involved
in
a
distinction
of
that
nature.
i
suppose
it
is
perfectly
clear
with
or
without
the
word
“willfully”
that
these
statutes
do
not
apply
unless
the
defendant
signed
the
document
consciously,
voluntarily
and
without
coercion
or
that
he
submitted
and
filed
the
documents
with
a
similar
voluntary
state.
but
i
would
submit
the
basic
state
of
mind
and
intent
reflected
in
these
statutes
is
in
the
lack
of
belief,
of
truth
required
by
the
felony
offense
and
the
knowledge
of
falsity
required
by
the
misdemeanor
offense
and
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
felony
in
that
case
requires
a
greater
degree
of
willfulness
than
the
misdemeanor.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
tax
case
which
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
state
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
indicted
in
the
eastern
district
of
california
on
the
charge
of
willfully
filing
income
tax
returns
which
he
did
not
believe
to
be
true
as
to
every
material
matter,
an
offense
punishable
as
a
felony
under
section
7206
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
elements
of
the
offense
defined
in
section
7206
(1)
are
that
the
defendant
willfully
makes
and
subscribes
a
document,
that
the
document
be
verified
under
the
penalty
of
perjury
and
that
the
defendant
does
not
believe
the
document
to
be
true
and
correct
as
to
every
material
matter.
the
evidence
introduced
at
respondent’s
trial
showed
that
the
respondent
was
a
practicing
attorney
who
owned
a
walnut
ranch
which
was
managed
by
his
step
mother.
during
the
three
years
in
issue,
1963
to
1965
inclusive,
respondent
sent
his
step
mother
weekly
checks
which
she
deposited
in
a
bank
account
for
purposes
of
covering
the
operating
expenses
of
respondent’s
ranch.
though
there
was
evidence
of
several
different
types
of
improper
deductions
claimed
by
respondent
on
his
tax
return,
the
crux
of
the
offense
charged
against
respondent
was
that
he
took
deductions
twice
for
these
operating
expenses
of
the
ranch.
what
he
did
was,
he
deducted
both
the
amounts
which
he
sent
to
his
stepmother
and
in
addition,
the
amounts
paid
by
her
out
of
those
very
same
funds
to
cover
the
ranch’s
expenses.
now,
respondent’s
defense
at
trial
and
the
really
only
matter
essentially
in
dispute
in
the
transcript
to
this
case
focused
primarily
on
his
claim
that
he
had
no
knowledge
that
the
deductions
were
false
and
consequently,
that
he
did
not
have
the
requisite
intent,
whatever
that
is
and
we
shall
discuss
that
at
great
length,
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
under
7206
(1)
which
as
i
indicated
requires
that
the
defendant
commit
the
prohibited
act
willfully.
in
addition
however,
the
respondent
requested
that
the
jury
be
instructed
that
it
could
find
him
innocent
of
the
felony
set
forth
in
7206
(1),
but
guilty
of
what
respondent
argued
was
the
lesser
included
offense
of
delivering
to
the
revenue
service
a
document
known
to
be
false
or
fraudulent
which
is
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor
under
section
7207
of
the
code,
which
respondent
argued
requires
a
lesser
degree
of
willfulness
than
does
the
felony
charged.
the
trial
judge
refused
respondent’s
request
to
charge
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
could
find
him
guilty
of
the
lesser
included
misdemeanor
and
respondent
was
indeed
found
guilty
as
charged
of
the
felony.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
held
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
the
lesser
included
offense
charge
for
which
reason
it
did
not
reach
other
issues
raised
on
appeal
by
respondent,
and
it
is
from
this
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
requiring
a
retrial
with
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
that
the
government
has
sought
certiorari
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
question
in
this
case
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
which
i
think
the
answer
is
quite
simple.
it
is
certainly
is
an
anomaly
at
first
glance
with
respect
to
that.
the
answer
i
think
is
that
7206,
the
felony
covers
only
documents
which
are
signed
by
the
taxpayer,
by
the
defendant
under
penalty
of
perjury,
where
as
the
misdemeanor
offense
refers
simply
to
any
document
including
for
example
a
work
sheet
handed
to
a
revenue
agent
and
of
course
of
an
audit
or
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
an
income
tax
return,
if
properly
filed,
and
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury.
there
is
an
overlap
between
the
two
offenses
insofar
as
the
misdemeanor
also
applies
to
documents
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury
but
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
more
severe
--
the
distinction
with
respect
severity
of
penalty
is
attributable
to
the
fact
that
one
section
refers
exclusively
to
documents
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury
and
that
is
a
reflection
of
a
historical
concept
that
a
document
so
signed
represents
a
more
serious
representation
and
probably
in
itself
a
more
greater
consciousness
of
affect
of
the
filing
of
the
document
than
thus
simply
handing
for
example
a
worksheet
to
a
revenue
agent.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right,
that
is
right,
it
could
be.
there
is
an
overlapping
element
and
which
i
think
we
are
forced
to
conclude
leaves
a
certain
amount
of
prosecutorial
discretion.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yeah,
the
practice
is
ordinarily
i
am
told
with
respect
to
income
tax
returns
to
prosecute
for
the
felony,
but
that
is
--
there
is
the
discretion
exercised
and
what
you
would
expect
to
be
the
factors
playing
into
such
a
discretion
or
use.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
by
the
individual
us
attorney
presumably
in
consultation
with
the
fraud
section
of
the
tax
division
and
the
internal
revenue
service.
let
me
point
out
that
the
discretion
is
actually
not
quite
as
the
prosecutorial
discretion
involved
in
this
overlap
of
offenses.
it's
not
quite
as
great
as
it
seems
to
be,
because
there
is
no
minimum
penalty
set
forth
in
the
felony
provision,
and
there
is
of
course
somewhat
higher
maximum
penalty
both
with
respect
to
imprisonment
and
to
fine,
but
there
is
no
minimum
penalty
so
that
sentencing
judge
really
is
left
with
the
great
bulk
of
the
discretion
to
determine
what
punishment
to
impose
and
in
this
case
for
example,
at
least
the
prison
sentence
was
well
below
the
maximum
for
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
certainly.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
certainly,
yes,
that
is
right.
well,
to
return
to
the
matter
of
lesser
included
offense,
rule
31
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
the
defendant
maybe
found
guilty
of
an
offense
“necessarily
included
in
the
offense
charged.”
now,
either
the
prosecution
or
the
defendant
may
request
that
a
charge
of
lesser
included
offense
be
given.
the
prosecution
may
want
the
lesser
included
offense
charged
for
the
rather
obvious
reason
that
it
may
think
that
the
jury
could
find
the
evidence
insufficient
to
support
the
greater
offense
charged,
but
sufficient
to
support
a
lesser
included
offense.
the
defendant’s
reasons
for
wanting
the
charge
of
somewhat
more
subtle
and
complex,
although
i
think
and
as
a
practical
matter
readily
apparent,
one
might
think
that
the
defendant
would
reason
that
if
the
jury
were
to
find
him
innocent
of
the
greater
offense,
it
would
to
his,
the
defendant’s
advantage
not
to
leave
the
jury
with
a
lesser
alternative
ground
for
conviction,
but
in
practice,
it
appears
that
in
many
cases,
the
defendants
feel
that
it
works
to
their
advantage
for
the
court
to
give
the
jury
a
range
of
offenses
varying
in
severity
of
which
the
defendant
maybe
convicted
and
i
suppose
quite
frankly,
the
underlying
assumption
of
that
is
that
the
jury
may
for
reasons
not
entirely
related
to
factual
determinations
that
it
is
supposed
to
make
in
the
case,
conclude
that
it
would
prefer
to
see
the
defendant
punished
with
a
lesser
offense
which
is
not
really
properly
within
the
jury’s
domain.
let
me
state
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
not
really
entirely,
analytically,
but
what
the
function
of
the
jury
is
supposed
to
be
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
don’t—
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
there
maybe
opinion
to
that
effect
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
all
the
law
on
lesser
included
offense
and
with
this,
i
think
that
the
respondent
does
not
anywhere
disagree
nor
did
the
court
below
disagree,
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
is
very
precisely
designed
to
avoid
presenting
the
jury
with
a
situation
in
which
it
has
to
and
makes
a
choice
on
a
non
factual
determination.
let
me
state
at
the
outset
that
though
it
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
the
government
and
respondent
are
in
complete
agreement
as
to
every
aspect
of
the
general
contours
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
and
i
shall
refer
to
a
possible
difference
of
opinion
later
on,
with
respect
to
the
key
issue
which
this
case
presents,
i
think
it
is
quite
fair
to
say
that
the
government
and
respondent
are
indeed
in
agreement
as
to
the
general
contours
of
a
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
and
disagree
only
as
to
the
applicability
of
that
doctrine
to
the
specific
felony
and
misdemeanor
offenses
set
forth
in
sections
7206
and
7207.
both
parties
agree
that
if
on
the
basis
of
the
undisputed
facts
in
this
case,
the
jury
could
not
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense
without
also
finding
him
guilty
of
the
greater
offense;
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
is
inapplicable.
in
other
words,
the
doctrine
does
not
apply
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
jury
which
in
fact
finds
the
defendant
guilty
of
both
offenses,
discretion
to
and
or
a
verdict
only
on
the
misdemeanor,
that
is
not
what
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine.
it's
about
regardless
of
what
maybe
argued
should
be
the
jury’s
function
in
other
context.
where
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
does
apply,
however,
is
where
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
might
reasonably
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
the
greater
offense,
but
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense.
consequently
in
this
case,
there
must
be
a
disputed
factual
matter
which
if
resolved
by
the
jury
in
a
certain
way
could
render
the
defendant
innocent
of
the
section
7206
felony,
but
guilty
of
the
section
7207
misdemeanor.
now,
it
is
undisputed
here
that
the
allegedly
fraudulent
documents
were
made
and
subscribed
by
the
defendant
under
penalty
of
perjury,
so
that
that
basic
distinction
in
these
two
statutes
is
not
part
of
the
factual,
underlying
factual
dispute
of
this
case.
what
respondent
does
argue
and
this
is
the
key
problem
in
the
case
is
that
section
7206
uses
the
word
willfully
in
a
sense
different
from
the
way
that
that
word
is
used
in
section
7207.
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
necessary
to
support
conviction
of
the
felony
is
greater
than
that
necessary
to
support
conviction
of
the
misdemeanor
and
consequently,
that
the
jury
could
reasonably
find
that
the
defendant
was
innocent
of
the
felony,
but
guilty
of
the
misdemeanor
on
a
lower
standard
willfulness.
so
that
his
position
depends
essentially
upon
reading
the
word
“willfully”
in
section
7206
to
imply
a
higher
standard
of
culpability,
if
you
will,
a
more
evil
motive
in
that
same
word
implies
in
the
next
section
7207.
and
in
spite
of
a
usual
presumption
that
the
same
word
would
not
be
used
differently
in
two
consecutive
sections
of
the
code
defining
very
closely
related
offenses
in
a
different
manner,
there
is
some
superficial
appeal
to
this
argument
as
i
have
stated
earlier
for
indeed,
it
may
appear
strange
at
first
glance
that
these
two
sections
punish
closely
related
offenses
in
a
different
manner,
unless
there
is
a
higher
degree
of
culpability
in
some
way
necessary
to
support
a
more
severely
punished
offense,
that
is
the
felony.
and
as
i
said,
i
think
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
what
that
distinction
is
based
upon
is
a
historical
distinction
with
some
validity
i
think
in
terms
of
reality
between
fraudulent
submission
of
a
document
under
penalty
of
--
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury
and
simply
a
document
which
is
not
signed
which
is
handed
over
to
an
official
with
the
government
in
administrative
capacity.
now,
having
dealt
with
the
reason
why
this
immediate
anomaly
is
really
only
superficial,
let
me
turn
to
what
i
suggest
is
really
the
overwhelming
reason
and
the
overwhelming
way
in
which
respondent’s
argument
that
willfully
in
section
7207
means
something
less
than
it
does
in
section
7206
is
plainly
contradicted
by
the
language
of
these
two
statutory
provisions.
section
7206,
the
felony
statute
requires
that
the
defendant
willfully
file
a
document
which
“he
does
not
believe
to
be
true
and
correct
as
to
every
material
manner.”
section
7207,
the
misdemeanor
statute
requires
that
the
defendant
willfully
file
a
document
“known
by
him
to
be
fraudulent
or
false
as
to
any
material
matter.”
it
is
difficult
to
understand
on
what
basis
the
court
below
could
have
concluded
and
respondent
can
argue
here
in
this
court
that
a
statute
which
hinges
liability
on
a
finding
merely
that
defendant
did
not
believe
the
documents
to
be
true
could
imply
a
greater
degree
of
willfulness
than
does
a
statute
which
hinges
liability
on
a
finding
that
the
defendant
knew
in
fact
that
the
documents
were
false
and
fraudulent.
indeed,
if
either
of
these
sections
implies
a
higher
standard
of
willfulness
or
evil
motive,
it
must
be
the
misdemeanor
statute
which
requires
knowledge
that
the
documents
at
issue
are
false.
now,
respondent
argues
in
his
brief
without
explaining
the
basis
of
his
argument
that
these
two
formulations
of
the
defendant’s
state
of
mind
are
basically
the
same
thing,
i.e.
that
not
believing
the
documents
to
be
true
and
knowing
them
to
be
false
are
really
not
meant
to
imply
meaningful
distinction,
and
i
think
there
is
a
rather
significant
irony
to
his
arguing
this
because
he
contends
on
the
one
hand
that
two
very
differently
worded
phrases
implying
to
the
average
reader
quite
a
different
meaning
and
i
think
meaningful
in
many
criminal
statutory
contexts,
that
these
two
very
differently
worded
phrases
used
in
connection
with
closely
related
offenses
in
consecutive
statutory
sections
are
intended
to
mean
the
same
thing.
while
on
the
other
hand,
he
argues
that
the
word
“willfully”
also
used
in
an
identical
manner,
the
same
word
used
identically
in
these
two
provisions
means
something
different
in
each
of
these
two
provisions
and
i
think
that
that’s
a
rather
strained
version
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
has
the
court
of
appeals
going
for
him
mr.
justice
stewart
in
what
i
think
is
a
just
an
explicable
ground
which
is
essentially
that
misdemeanor
us
per
se
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
willfully
and
misdemeanor
means
something
different
from
willfully
in
the
context
of
felonies,
and
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
though
willfully,
the
word
willfully
may
mean
different
things
in
different,
the
context
of
different
factual
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
its
certainly
not,
that
difference
is
certainly
not
based
on
some
arbitrary
distinction
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
is
virtually
all
that
it
says
and
quite
conclusively
in
support
of
its
holding.
furthermore,
apart
from
the
fact
that
if
there
is
any
distinction
at
all
between
the
uses
of
the
word
“willfully”
in
these
two
sections,
the
higher
standard
is
really
under
misdemeanor
which
acquires
knowledge
of
falsity.
let’s
look
at
what
respondent
says
is
the
substantive
meaning
of
willfully
and
the
misdemeanor
charge.
he
claims
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
of
the
misdemeanor
is
satisfied
in
finding
that
the
defendant
acted
capriciously
or
with
a
careless
disregard
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
“that
the
defendant
formed
the
specific
evil
purpose
of
misleading
the
government,”
this
is
the
language
of
his
requested
charge
and
language
basically
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
i
suppose
somewhat
paradoxical
for
the
government
to
be
in
the
position
of
arguing
for
a
higher
standard
of
culpability
than
does
the
defendant
even
with
respect
to
a
charge
that
has
not
been
brought
against
this
particular
defendant,
but
frankly,
we
simply
cannot
square
a
standard
of
careless
or
capricious
behavior
and
a
lack
of
purpose
to
mislead
the
government
with
that
requirement
in
section
7207,
that
the
defendant
willfully
submit
documents
which
he
knows
to
be
false.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
government
has
--
it
is
not
clear
that
the
government
has
ever
urged
in
any
tax
misdemeanor
statute
a
standard
of
mere
carelessness
or
capriciousness
and
we
deal
with
that
in
the
reply
brief
in
some
detail
when
we
replied
ti
his
brief
--
to
his
opposition
to
our
petition,
but
in
any
event,
the
only
statute
which
he
even
claims
that
we
have
ever
applied
a
standard
of
carelessness
or
capriciousness
to
and
the
only
misdemeanor
tax
statute
is
section
7203,
which
deals
with
willful
failure
to
file
required
documents,
a
return
of
filed
documents,
and
an
omission,
a
willful
omission
of
a
required
act
may
involve
a
different
and
lower
standard
of
evil
intent
or
willfulness
than
does
submission
of
a
known
fraudulent
document.
so
that
really,
we
are
not
trying
to
apply
across
the
board
in
any
context
a
universal
standard
of
what
the
word
“willfully”
means.
that
depends
in
each
instance
upon
an
analysis
of
the
factual
background
that
the
statute
is
directed
towards.
indeed,
this
court
has
specifically
rejected
the
argument
that
the
misdemeanor
set
forth
in
section
7207
can
be
committed
merely
by
carelessness
and
without
conscious
knowledge
of
the
wrongfulness
of
the
defendant’s
act.
in
the
sense,
sansone
case
at
380
u.s.,
the
defendant
who
was
tried
for
the
felony
charge
of
willfully
attempting
to
evade
taxes
which
is
defined
in
section
7201
and
he
requested
there
as
he
or
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
to
the
effect
that
he
could
be
convicted
if
it
were
found
that
he
did
not
have
the
requisite
intent
for
the
felony
of
willfully
attempting
to
evade
taxes.
you
could
still
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
one
felony
and
two
misdemeanors
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
the
only
felony
involved
was
7201.
there
were
two
misdemeanors,
i
think
7203,
the
failure
to
file
was
also
involved,
but
i
think
what
he
had
asked
for
in
sansone
was
a
charge
that
instead
of
the
felony,
he
could
be
charged
with
either
of
two
misdemeanors,
but
in
any
event,
i
don’t
think
that’s
important
for
our
purposes
here
because
the
key
issue
in
the
sansone
is
that
the
court
denied
him
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
and
stated
quite
specifically
that
at
least
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
willfulness
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
in
both
the
felony
7201
and
the
very
misdemeanor
at
issue
here
required
some
sort
of
willful
knowledge
and
evil
intent
and
it's
quite,
the
court
quite
specifically
rejected
there
any
notion
that
section
7207
can
be
satisfied
by
a
mere
showing
of
carelessness
or
capriciousness.
furthermore,
i
think
that
the
sansone
opinion
which
was
really
not
dealt
with
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
meaningful
way
precludes
the
ninth
circuit’s
across
the
board
holding
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
in
tax
misdemeanors
is
necessarily
less
than
it
is
for
tax
felonies
because
sansone
said
that
the
standard
of
willfulness
with
respect
that
tax
misdemeanor,
the
one
at
issue
here
and
the
tax
felony
at
issue
there,
were
indeed
exactly
the
same.
finally,
we
make
an
alternative
argument
that
is
related
in
several
respects
to
our
contention
that
the
misdemeanor
in
section
7207
does
not
import
a
lesser
degree
of
willfulness
than
does
the
offense
set
forth
in
7206
but
which
focuses
on
the
applicability
generally
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
itself.
this
is
a
slightly
different
argument
though
based
upon
many
of
the
same
underlying
reasons.
at
common
laws,
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
was
restricted
to
situations
in
which
the
misdemeanor
was
entirely
included
in
the
statute,
that
is
in
which
there
was
no
element
necessary
to
sustain
a
conviction
of
the
lesser
offense
which
was
not
necessary
in
addition
to
sustained
conviction
of
the
greater
offense.
this
strict
version
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
appears
to
have
been
incorporated
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
rule
31
(c)
requires
that
the
defendant
maybe
found
guilty
of
an
offense
necessarily
included
in
the
offense
charged.
now,
there
maybe
in
some
jurisdictions
have
allowed
slight
deviation
from
that
rule
and
respondent
implies
in
his
brief
that
he
feels
that
some
of
the
circuit
courts
have
implied
by
way
of
dicta
that
there
maybe
situations
in
which
the
federal
courts
could
allow
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
even
though
that
could
conceivably
be
circumstances
in
which
the
defendant
could
be
found
guilty
of
the
greater
offense
without
being
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense.
and
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
get
into
the
precise
contours
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine.
i
think
whatever
justification
there
maybe
for
slightly
more
liberal
application
of
that
of
this
doctrine,
it
should
not
be
applicable
here.
for
even
if
contrary
to
our
contention,
the
court
were
to
find
that
the
word
“willfully”
in
section
7206
means
something
more
than
it
does
in
section
7207,
the
misdemeanor
under
section
7207
would
still
not
be
a
lesser
included
offense
within
the
felony
under
section
7206
because
knowledge
of
falsity
is
a
key
element
of
the
misdemeanor,
but
is
not
an
element
of
the
felony.
even
if
willfulness
has
no
relationship
by
some
strange
court
to
the
states
of
mind
that
are
defined
in
these
very
statutes,
it
cannot
be
denied
on
the
language
of
the
statute
that
there
is
an
element,
a
key
element
under
misdemeanor,
an
element
which
was
in
actual
dispute
in
this
case
presents
the
respondent’s
defense
rested
almost
entirely
upon
his
assertion
with
respect
to
his
state
of
mind,
there
is
a
key
element
of
the
misdemeanor
which
is
not
necessary
to
support
the
felony
and
consequently
under
even
a
slightly
more
liberal
reading
than
is
traditional
and
then
is
implied
by
the
federal
rules
of
a
lesser
included
defense
doctrine,
this
offense,
this
misdemeanor
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
within
the
broader
scope
of
this
felony
because
there
is
a
key
element
to
it,
knowledge
of
falsity
that
is
not
necessary
to
support
the
felony.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
berra
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that’s
the
point
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
the
point
here,
but
there
is
a
rather
strong
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
justice
black
and
douglas
i
think
dissented
in
that
case
on
the
ground
that
they
feel
that
a
statute
is
ought
not
to
be
interpreted
if
possible
to
render
the
prosecution
with
any
degree
of
discretion
to
choose
between
which
offense
when
the
underlying
commissions
are
identical.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes
it
did,
it
did.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right
and
that
was
the
ground,
but
that
was
the
ground
that
the
dissent
put
it
on,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
holding
in
that
case
and
the
majority
opinion
in
an
any
way
contradicts
our
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
helps
you,
yes.
it
helps
us,
yes,
and
it
certainly
does
not
contradict
our
assertion
that
and
really,
i
don’t
think
this
in
contention,
i
don’t
respondent
basis
is
argument
at
all
upon
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
--
general
attack
of
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine.
if
the
two
offenses,
if
it
is
obvious
that
the
two
offenses
have
to
be
identically
determined,
then
there
is,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
lesser
included
offense
doctrine
is
not
applicable
and
what
justices
black
and
douglas
resented
in
that
case
in
their
dissent
was
that
statutes
are
not
to
be
interpreted
to
overlap
to
too
great
an
extent
because
it
is
improper
for
the
prosecutor
to
have
excessive
discretion
that
is
ordinarily
the
domain
of
the
judge.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
right.
what
the
sansone
case
specifically
said
was
that
the
domain
of
the
jury
was
only
to
choose
between
offenses
on
the
basis
of
determining
the
factual
background
that
would
support
one
offense
to
the
other
but
not
to
find
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
both
offenses
and
then
to
go
ahead
and
choose
which
one
to
find
him
guilty
of,
that
is
precisely
what’s
sansone
said.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
that
would
permit
the
jury
to
invade
the
domain
that
is
everyone
agrees
it’s
proper
for
the
judge
and
in
some
circumstances,
it's
proper
within
limited
bounds
for
the
prosecution.
i
would
like
mr.
chief
justice
to
reserve
the
small
amount
of
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
nothing
especially
new
to
say
except
that
to
sum
up.
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is,
i
have
perceived
in
the
course
of
respondent’s
counsel’s
argument
an
underlying
dissatisfaction
with
the
material
involved
in
this
case.
it
is
that
which
i
had
anticipated
and
it
centers
on
the
rather
unsatisfactory
and
illusory
meaning
of
the
word
“willful”
in
the
context
of
all
these
criminal
tax
statutes
and
it
becomes
especially
difficult
to
pinpoint
precisely
what
congress
meant
by
the
word
willful
when
we
deal
as
we
do
here
with
two
statutory
provisions
that
define
the
basic
state
of
mind
required
to
commit
the
offense
entirely
apart
from
using
the
word
willfully.
one
of
these
statutes
defines
the
basic
state
of
mind
involved
in
the
commission
of
the
offense
in
terms
of
lack
of
belief
that
the
knowledge
contain
that
the
document
is
true.
the
other
defines
that
state
of
mind
in
terms
of
a
knowledge
or
falsity
of
the
underlying
information.
i
think
that
the
likelihood
is
that
the
word
willfully
is
probably
close
to
superfluous
in
both
of
this
statutes
since
the
underlying
state
of
mind
is
defined,
but
the
court
needn’t
reach
the
metaphysical
possibilities
of
what
willfully
can
mean
precisely
in
each
of
these
contexts.
it
is
sufficient
for
purposes
of
this
argument
to
observe
that
the
basic
state
of
mind
necessary
to
support
the
misdemeanor
is
a
more
serious
culpable
standard,
knowledge
or
falsity,
then
is
the
state
of
mind
necessary
to
support
the
felony.
and
i’ve
yet
to
perceive
either
from
respondent’s
presentation
or
from
the
court
of
appeals
any
possible
way
of
holding
that
lack
of
belief
can
be
a
greater
culpable
standard
in
itself
and
imply
greater
degree
of
willfulness
than
can
the
knowledge
of
falsity.
i
perceived
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
questions
if
i’m
not
mistaken,
some
possible
attempt
to
focus
the
word
“willfully”
not
on
that
state
of
mind
as
described
in
the
statute,
but
on
the
very
act
of
delivery
or
act
of
making
and
subscribing
itself
and
i
cannot
understand
what
might
be
involved
in
a
distinction
of
that
nature.
i
suppose
it
is
perfectly
clear
with
or
without
the
word
“willfully”
that
these
statutes
do
not
apply
unless
the
defendant
signed
the
document
consciously,
voluntarily
and
without
coercion
or
that
he
submitted
and
filed
the
documents
with
a
similar
voluntary
state.
but
i
would
submit
the
basic
state
of
mind
and
intent
reflected
in
these
statutes
is
in
the
lack
of
belief,
of
truth
required
by
the
felony
offense
and
the
knowledge
of
falsity
required
by
the
misdemeanor
offense
and
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
felony
in
that
case
requires
a
greater
degree
of
willfulness
than
the
misdemeanor.
thank
you.
