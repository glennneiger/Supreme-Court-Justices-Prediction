an

state’s
effort
in

fails
unfortunately
to
look
at
the
state’s
responsibility
and
commitment
for

from

this
is
somewhat
has
happened
today.
it's
my
purpose
to
outline
the
new

commitment
and
responsibility
for
education.

of

state
constitution
fixes
the
primary
duty
to
provide

the
education
of

in

york
state
on
the

it
requires
that
the
legislature
provide
for
a
system
of
free
schools
wherein
all
the
children
of
the
state
may
be
educated.
we
educate
four
million
children
in
the
elementary
and
secondary
schools
of
new
york
state
each
year.
approximately
18%
or
750,000
of
these
attend
the
nonpublic
schools.
the
cost
of
state
financing
of
public
education
rose
to
over
$2.5
billion
in
the
1972-1973
fiscal
year,
and
increased
to
$500
million
over
the
1969-1970
year.
the
cost
of
the
state
of
educating
the
750,000
nonpublic
school
is
virtually
non-existent.
the
cost
of
educating
--
the
total
cost
of
education
in
the
state
of
new
york
is
$5
billion,
another
$2.5
billion
contributed
by
the
localities.
the
support
of
the
nonpublic
school
education
is
in
the
main
from
contributions,
endowments
and
of
late,
approximately
but
not
quite
1/3rd
through
tuition
payments
by
parents,
who
in
addition
to
making
this
tuition
payments
also
have
a
normal
tax
load.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
no
they
don’t
but
what
i’m
attempting
to
do
is
put
into
the
total
perspective
of
the
educational
aspect.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
they
are
paying
sales
taxes,
and
they're
paying
if
they
own
real
properties,
some
type
of
real
property
tax.
they
do
pay
some
type
of
real
estate
tax
if
there
is
a
charge
back
by
the
landlord
to
attendant
in
an
apartment.
the
greatly
increased
cost
of
nonpublic
education
plus
ruinous
inflation,
plus
ever
increasing
taxes
on
all
levels
of
government
including
education
has
precipitated
a
danger
within
the
nonpublic
school
system
in
new
york
state.
i
have
delineated
in
pages
11
through
15
of
my
brief
why
this
is
of
such
great
consequences
to
it
there
is
not
a
tax
base
to
which
the
public
schools
infer
the
look
in
a
number
of
our
cities
to
increase
their
total
commitment
towards
education.
to
fulfill
its
responsibility
in
the
public
sector,
the
state
contributes
cash
grants
and
aids.
general
cash
assistance
on
a
per
capita
basis
on
a
formula
derived
through
weighted
average
attendance
is
the
primary
form.
faced
with
the
crisis
in
the
public
schools
and
mindful
of
their
responsibility
for
the
education
of
all
children,
including
the
children
in
the
nonpublic
schools,
the
legislature
enacted
the
program
which
is
here
under
review.
they
determined
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
and
that
it
was
important
that
not
only
the
nonpublic
school
system
of
education
new
york
continue
to
exist
but
that
there
be
available
a
plurality
of
educational
opportunity
in
new
york
state.
when
talking
about
the
children
in
nonpublic
schools,
we
are
talking
about
new
york
state
citizens,
about
our
own
children.
so
just
as
we
provide
for
cash
assistance
on
a
per
capita
aid
basis
in
the
public
schools,
the
legislature
responded
by
overwhelming
proportions
in
the
private
sector
by
enacting
a
program
of
moderate,
minimal
and
varied
assistance
to
low
income
children
and
their
parents
and
to
middle
income
parents
and
to
support
their
voluntary
effort
in
education.
this
is
not
a
special
isolated
program,
it's
part
of
the
general
program
of
assistance
to
education
by
new
york
state.
indeed,
it
would
seem
that
if
new
york
state
was
so
determined,
it
could
have
quit
itself
of
its
educational
responsibility
by
total
grant
and
aid
assistance
to
all
of
the
parents,
both
public
and
nonpublic.
if
that
be
the
case
and
allow
those
parents
to
determine
what
schools
they
wanted
to
send
their
children,
whether
it's
public
or
private,
if
that
be
the
case,
it
would
appear
that
new
york,
having
made
its
choice
of
its
machinery
or
mechanism
to
strike
down
the
nonpublic
sector
would
be
to
put
form
before
substance.
new
york’s
minimal
program
of
aid
reflects
the
appropriate
and
the
required
governmental
neutrality
toward
religion.
it
neither
governmentally
establishes
a
religion
nor
governmentally
interferes
with
the
religion.
our
task
in
enacting
the
omnibus
act
was
we
felt
to
reach
that
neutral
ground
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
the
new
york
program
does
not
encourage
attendance
at
nonpublic
schools,
indeed
in
any
of
event,
it's
going
to
be
more
costly.
the
state
is
simply
not
involved
in
the
parent’s
choice
of
what
school
the
parents
chooses
for
their
children.
while
the
program
may
enhance
the
ability
of
a
parent
to
exercise
his
choice
of
which
school
his
child
would
attend,
it
is
nevertheless
completely
neutral
in
that
it
does
not
favor
religion
over
non-religion,
it
does
not
sponsor
a
particular
sect
nor
does
it
try
to
encourage
participation
in
or
abnegation
of
religion.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
distinction
should
be
made
for
programs
of
aid
to
poverty
area
schools
and
to
low
income
parents
should
distinguish
it
from
an
overall
program.
in
enacting
legislation,
it
was
felt
strongly
that
a
program
of
aid
of
health
and
welfare
grants
to
low
income
impoverished
areas
which
had
certain
restrictions
did
fall
within
the
welfare
assistance
benefit
program
and
should
be
considered
as
a
welfare
benefit
program.
these
restrictions
are
as
follows.
the
schools
to
be
benefited
incidentally
about
280
out
of
the
total
2,000
nonpublic
schools
are
benefited
by
section
1,
the
schools
to
be
benefited
must
be
schools
which
have
a
substantial
proportion
of
children
attending
whose
parents
receive
adc.
in
addition,
that's
required
by
title
iv,
in
addition,
under
title
iv,
teachers,
in
those
schools
who
had
gone
to
higher
education
on
loans
would
receive
a
forgiveness
from
the
federal
government
because
they
are
teaching
in
these
tight
ghetto
area
schools.
the
school
cannot
be
in
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
to
avoid
the
question
of
entanglement,
we
require
that
the
school
provide
a
private
audit.
there
is
no
involvement
of
the
state
going
in
that.
the
school
provides
a
private
audit
and
that
private
audit
is
forwarded
to
the
state.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
2,000
non
public
schools
in
the
state
and
about
280
of
the
schools
are
benefited
by
section
1.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
under
15,
between
--
about
12%.
the
question
arose
is
to
whether
or
not
the
chapel
could
be
painted.
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
no.
the
legislative
findings
are
restricted
to
expenditures
which
are
clearly
secular,
neutral
and
non-ideological
in
nature.
expenditures
for
a
chapel
clearly
could
not
fall
into
that
restricted
criteria.
the
commissioner
of
education
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
given
the
authority
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
where
he
could
not
approve
as
a
result
of
getting
this
private
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
the
heating
system
could
be
replaced
to
the
extent
that
it
would
fall
within
the
definition
of
a
secular,
non-ideological
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
it
could
be
replaced
but
we
have
built
into
the
statute
what
we
consider
a
statistical
requirement
of
neutrality
and
that
is
that
--
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
it
could
be
replaced,
but
our
preposition
in
formulating
the
legislation
was
that
we
would
never
get
to
a
position
to
where
we
would
pay
the
total
amount
of
the
repair
or
replacement
of
the
heating
system
because
in
no
event
can
the
cost
reimbursed
by
the
state
be
more
than
50%
of
the
comparable
cost
in
the
public
sector
and
that
we
try
to
build
in
as
a
statistical
degree
of
neutrality
here.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
that's
correct,
but
our
purpose
was
not
that
you
could
provide
for
the
total
cost
of
repairing
the
heating
system.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
that's
correct.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
answer
as
to
the
question
of
whether
we
could
provide
such
services
or
such
repairs
to
schools
where
all
they
teach
is
religion,
the
answer
is
no
because
again
it
must
be
only
those
areas
which
are
non-ideological,
secular
and
neutral.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
hopefully,
we
won't
have
to
do
that.
the
number
of
schools
that
are
sectarian
were
incorrectly
stated
in
that
96%.
there
is
approximately
82%
of
the
nonpublic
schools
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
sectarian.
and
finally
with
regard
to
the
modification
of
gross
--
adjusted
gross
income
and
whether
or
not
that
distinguishes
from
any
other
type
of
income
tax
change.
section
612
(c)
of
the
new
york
state
tax
law
provides
for
some
15
or
16
modifications.
an
example
of
which
you
can
modify
your
adjusted
federal
gross
income
by
subtracting
there
from
any
amounts
of
income
derived
through
united
states
savings
plan.
this
is
a
modification.
well
what
we
do
is
add
to
section
612
(c)
an
additional
modification
which
will
provide
on
a
reduced
graduated
scale
as
you
go
up
the
line
to
an
income
of
$25,000,
an
amount
which
would
be
taken
away
or
reduce
your
federal
adjusted
gross
income
for
new
york
state
income
tax
liability.
the
purpose
of
this
was
that
we
would
benefit
the
parent
who
is
benefiting
the
state
by
their
voluntary
effort
in
the
nonpublic
or
private
school
arena
and
we
are
doing
it
on
the
first
level
so
that
we
benefit
the
parent
before
it
becomes
involved
in
any
other
types
of
upstate
moneys.
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
on
the
question
of
the
modification
of
tax
income,
the
court
looked
to
the
decision
of
the
majority
below
upholding
the
modification
program
where
it
points
out
that
it
does
not
involve
a
subsidy,
or
grant
this
money
from
the
state
treasury.
it
has
a
particular
secular
intent,
one
of
equity
to
give
some
recompense
by
way
of
tax
relief
to
our
citizens
who
bear
their
share
with
the
burden
of
maintaining
the
public
schools
and
who
because
of
religious
belief
or
otherwise
send
their
children
to
nonpublic
full
time
schools
as
is
their
constitutional
right.
the
benefit
to
the
public
appropriate
schools,
if
any,
is
so
remote
so
as
not
to
involve
impermissible
financial
aid
to
church
schools
and
lastly
there
is
a
minimum
administrative
entanglement
with
the
nonpublic
schools
nor
is
ongoing
political
activity
likely
to
cause
division
on
strictly
religious
lines.
it
was
our
intent
to
reach
the
neutral
point
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
and
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
with
regard
to
the
health
and
safety
grants
be
reversed
with
regard
to
the
tuition
reimbursement
be
reversed
with
regard
to
the
tax
modification
be
affirmed.
thank
you.

that
neutral
ground
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
the
new
york
program
does
not
encourage
attendance
at
nonpublic
schools,
indeed
in
any
of
event,
it's
going
to
be
more
costly.
the
state
is
simply
not
involved
in
the
parent’s
choice
of
what
school
the
parents
chooses
for
their
children.
while
the
program
may
enhance
the
ability
of
a
parent
to
exercise
his
choice
of
which
school
his
child
would
attend,
it
is
nevertheless
completely
neutral
in
that
it
does
not
favor
religion
over
non-religion,
it
does
not
sponsor
a
particular
sect
nor
does
it
try
to
encourage
participation
in
or
abnegation
of
religion.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
distinction
should
be
made
for
programs
of
aid
to
poverty
area
schools
and
to
low
income
parents
should
distinguish
it
from
an
overall
program.
in
enacting
legislation,
it
was
felt
strongly
that
a
program
of
aid
of
health
and
welfare
grants
to
low
income
impoverished
areas
which
had
certain
restrictions
did
fall
within
the
welfare
assistance
benefit
program
and
should
be
considered
as
a
welfare
benefit
program.
these
restrictions
are
as
follows.
the
schools
to
be
benefited
incidentally
about
280
out
of
the
total
2,000
nonpublic
schools
are
benefited
by
section
1,
the
schools
to
be
benefited
must
be
schools
which
have
a
substantial
proportion
of
children
attending
whose
parents
receive
adc.
in
addition,
that's
required
by
title
iv,
in
addition,
under
title
iv,
teachers,
in
those
schools
who
had
gone
to
higher
education
on
loans
would
receive
a
forgiveness
from
the
federal
government
because
they
are
teaching
in
these
tight
ghetto
area
schools.
the
school
cannot
be
in
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
to
avoid
the
question
of
entanglement,
we
require
that
the
school
provide
a
private
audit.
there
is
no
involvement
of
the
state
going
in
that.
the
school
provides
a
private
audit
and
that
private
audit
is
forwarded
to
the
state.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
2,000
non
public
schools
in
the
state
and
about
280
of
the
schools
are
benefited
by
section
1.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
under
15,
between
--
about
12%.
the
question
arose
is
to
whether
or
not
the
chapel
could
be
painted.
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
no.
the
legislative
findings
are
restricted
to
expenditures
which
are
clearly
secular,
neutral
and
non-ideological
in
nature.
expenditures
for
a
chapel
clearly
could
not
fall
into
that
restricted
criteria.
the
commissioner
of
education
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
given
the
authority
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
where
he
could
not
approve
as
a
result
of
getting
this
private
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
the
heating
system
could
be
replaced
to
the
extent
that
it
would
fall
within
the
definition
of
a
secular,
non-ideological
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
it
could
be
replaced
but
we
have
built
into
the
statute
what
we
consider
a
statistical
requirement
of
neutrality
and
that
is
that
--
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
it
could
be
replaced,
but
our
preposition
in
formulating
the
legislation
was
that
we
would
never
get
to
a
position
to
where
we
would
pay
the
total
amount
of
the
repair
or
replacement
of
the
heating
system
because
in
no
event
can
the
cost
reimbursed
by
the
state
be
more
than
50%
of
the
comparable
cost
in
the
public
sector
and
that
we
try
to
build
in
as
a
statistical
degree
of
neutrality
here.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
that's
correct,
but
our
purpose
was
not
that
you
could
provide
for
the
total
cost
of
repairing
the
heating
system.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
that's
correct.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
answer
as
to
the
question
of
whether
we
could
provide
such
services
or
such
repairs
to
schools
where
all
they
teach
is
religion,
the
answer
is
no
because
again
it
must
be
only
those
areas
which
are
non-ideological,
secular
and
neutral.
mr.
john
f.
haggerty
hopefully,
we
won't
have
to
do
that.
the
number
of
schools
that
are
sectarian
were
incorrectly
stated
in
that
96%.
there
is
approximately
82%
of
the
nonpublic
schools
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
sectarian.
and
finally
with
regard
to
the
modification
of
gross
--
adjusted
gross
income
and
whether
or
not
that
distinguishes
from
any
other
type
of
income
tax
change.
section
612
(c)
of
the
new
york
state
tax
law
provides
for
some
15
or
16
modifications.
an
example
of
which
you
can
modify
your
adjusted
federal
gross
income
by
subtracting
there
from
any
amounts
of
income
derived
through
united
states
savings
plan.
this
is
a
modification.
well
what
we
do
is
add
to
section
612
(c)
an
additional
modification
which
will
provide
on
a
reduced
graduated
scale
as
you
go
up
the
line
to
an
income
of
$25,000,
an
amount
which
would
be
taken
away
or
reduce
your
federal
adjusted
gross
income
for
new
york
state
income
tax
liability.
the
purpose
of
this
was
that
we
would
benefit
the
parent
who
is
benefiting
the
state
by
their
voluntary
effort
in
the
nonpublic
or
private
school
arena
and
we
are
doing
it
on
the
first
level
so
that
we
benefit
the
parent
before
it
becomes
involved
in
any
other
types
of
upstate
moneys.
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
on
the
question
of
the
modification
of
tax
income,
the
court
looked
to
the
decision
of
the
majority
below
upholding
the
modification
program
where
it
points
out
that
it
does
not
involve
a
subsidy,
or
grant
this
money
from
the
state
treasury.
it
has
a
particular
secular
intent,
one
of
equity
to
give
some
recompense
by
way
of
tax
relief
to
our
citizens
who
bear
their
share
with
the
burden
of
maintaining
the
public
schools
and
who
because
of
religious
belief
or
otherwise
send
their
children
to
nonpublic
full
time
schools
as
is
their
constitutional
right.
the
benefit
to
the
public
appropriate
schools,
if
any,
is
so
remote
so
as
not
to
involve
impermissible
financial
aid
to
church
schools
and
lastly
there
is
a
minimum
administrative
entanglement
with
the
nonpublic
schools
nor
is
ongoing
political
activity
likely
to
cause
division
on
strictly
religious
lines.
it
was
our
intent
to
reach
the
neutral
point
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
and
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
with
regard
to
the
health
and
safety
grants
be
reversed
with
regard
to
the
tuition
reimbursement
be
reversed
with
regard
to
the
tax
modification
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
