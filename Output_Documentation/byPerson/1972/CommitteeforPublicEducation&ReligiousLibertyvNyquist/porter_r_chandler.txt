mr.
porter
r.
chandler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
two
groups
of
parents.
one,
are
parents
with
taxable
incomes
of
less
than
$5000.00
who
are
eligible
for
tuition
refund
under
section
2
of
the
act.
the
other
group
of
parents
have
adjusted
gross
incomes
of
less
than
$35000.00
and
are
eligible
for
the
tax
modification
provided
in
sections
3
through
5
of
the
act.
the
emphasis
that
i
want
to
make
from
the
start
is
that
this
statute
is
aimed
to
help
parents,
not
schools
and
that
we
represent
parents
who
are
directly
affected.
now
what
kind
of
figures
are
we
talking
about?
i
realize
from
questions
this
morning
that
the
percentage
one
or
the
other
is
not
of
particular
importance,
but
we
are
talking
now
about
the
children
in
new
york
state
who
go
to
non-public
schools
and
there
are
about
750,000
of
them
as
compared
to
about
3,200,000
public
school.
the
750,000
non-public
school
children
attend
schools
of
all
categories.
the
only
requirement
of
the
school
is
that
it
should
give
a
satisfactory
education
in
secular
subjects
and
that
it
should
not
discriminate
on
the
race
and
so
on
as
indicated
in
what
mrs.
coon
just
said.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
can't
be
a
what?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
can’t
be
a
profit
making,
you
are
quite
right,
your
honor,
a
non-profit
school
that
comes
with
every
requirements
of
the
compulsory
education
law.
there
are
a
total
of
something
around
2000
such
schools
in
new
york
state
and
the
figures
roughly
are
that
about
1400
of
them
are
affiliated
with
the
catholic
church.
300
or
a
little
more
are
affiliated
with
i
think
some
dozen
or
more
other
religious
bodies,
the
largest
one
next
to
the
catholic
church
is
the
jewish
schools
and
about
300
more
are
non-religiously
affiliated,
total
of
about
2000,
they
are
accounting
for
750,000
children.
and
while
i
am
on
the
subject
which
has
been
injected
again
and
again,
i
want
in
some
of
these
cases,
i
want
to
correct
second
misapprehensions
as
to
what
the
catholic
school
at
least
is
or
is
not.
it
is
not
a
school
for
rich
or
medium
well-to-do.
it
is
increasingly
becoming
a
school
of
the
poor
and
of
minority
races.
the
figures
show
that
in
new
york
city
alone,
there
are
70,000
families
with
children
in
catholic
schools
who
are
--
have
incomes
at
or
near
the
poverty
level.
the
figures
show
that
catholic
elementary
schools
in
the
bronx
and
manhattan
have
31,000
non-white
children
attending
out
of
65,000
total.
more
than
60%
of
the
children
in
catholic
schools
in
manhattan
are
black
or
spanish
speaking
and
over
30%
in
the
bronx.
so
the
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
largely
puerto
rican.
well,
new
york
has
a
rather
large
spanish
other
than
puerto
rican
community,
rest
of
latin
america
and
from
spain
itself.
yes,
the
others
would
be
primarily
puerto
rican.
and
now,
the
statute
comes
before
you
with
very
strong
legislative
findings
as
to
each
of
the
sections
involved
and
the
statute
recognized
the
burdens
that
are
now
being
borne
by
parents
who
send
children
to
accredited
non-public
schools
who
read
the
state
of
that
tax
burden,
under
section
2
to
5.
concentrating
first
on
the
tax,
on
the
tuition
reimbursement,
the
character
is
that
the
requirements
for
admission
to
that
ballpark
are
that
you
should
have
an
income
of
less
than
25
--
income
of
less
than
--
taxable
income
of
less
than
$5000.00,
that
you
should
have
children
in
a
non-public
school,
that
you
shall
have
paid
tuition
for
having
them
there
and
the
tuition,
as
mrs.
coon
pointed
out,
the
tuition
that
is
ultimately
reimbursable
can
in
no
case
exceed
half
what
was
actually
paid.
it
is
half
what
was
actually
paid
or
$50.00
per
annum
for
elementary
school
pupil,
$100.00
per
annum
for
high
school
pupil.
i
mentioned
that
because
with
all
respect
i
think
mr.
pfeffer
misquoted
this
morning.
he
said
that
you
could
get
up
to
the
full
amount
of
tuition
which
you
cannot.
on
the
tuition
reimbursement
provision,
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
a
good
secular
legislative
purpose
and
the
effect
is
actually,
we
submit,
neither
to
the
grants
nor
to
inhibit
religion.
it's
the
nature
of
pluralistic
society
to
see
that
all
segments
of
the
society
have
a
right
to
mature
and
develop
and
be
adequately
represented.
new
york,
with
its
tradition
of
over
200
years
of
a
single
system
of
education,
both
public
and
private,
under
the
board
of
regions
has
always
laid
stressed
on
promoting
plurality
and
diversity
and
the
refund,
as
i
have
emphasized
is
for
the
benefit
of
parents,
it
goes
to
parents
only.
there
is
no
question
of
a
conduit
here.
parent
has
his
child
in
the
school.
to
get
him
in,
he
has
to
pay
tuition
at
the
beginning
of
the
year,
he
pays
it
and
he
is
parted
with
that
money.
some
months
later,
after
he
has
filled
out
the
necessary
forms,
he
gets
back
from
the
state
a
check
representing
a
small
fraction
of
what
he
may
have
paid
to
the
school.
he
does
not
--
that's
his
money,
he
has
already
paid
the
school.
there
is
no
connection
between
the
two
of
them.
it
is
perfectly
open
to
that
parent
to
say
i
don’t
like
this
school
any
longer.
i
won’t
bring
my
child
back
next
year,
i’ll
take
him
out.
and
it
is
all
right
for
him
to
say
“i’ve
got
$50.00
here
from
the
state,
it
is
a
win
for
all,
i
will
go
spend
it
at
the
races.”
or
if
he
is
feeling
more
charitable,
he
will
say
to
his
wife,
“in
lieu
of
the
price
of
steaks,
i
am
going
to
give
you
this
money,
you
can
go
downtown
and
buy
a
good
nice
steak
to
celebrate
with.”
there
is
no
accounting.
in
the
assertion
this
morning
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
he
knew
that
the
money
was
coming.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
just
as
the
parent,
the
parent
who
paid
the
bus
company
in
everson,
he
knew
he
was
going
to
get
it
back
but
when
he
got
it
back,
it
was
his
money
i
think,
your
honor.
there
was
discussion
this
morning
of
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights
as
an
example
of
this
tuition
business.
i
could
--
we
have
listed
in
our
brief
various
other
similar
items
such
as
the
region
scholarship
and
the
scholar
incentive
programs
in
new
york
state
and
i
shall
develop
those
further.
as
to
entanglement,
this
tuition
refund
requires
a
minimum
of
entanglement.
there
must
be
a
verification
the
children
are
actually
enrolled
at
schools,
no
entanglement
there.
a
verification
that
tuition
has
been
paid,
then
a
verification
that
the
individual
in
question
is
not
telling
different
stories
to
the
people
to
whom
he
is
asking
for
the
tax
refund
and
the
tax
authority.
in
other
words,
if
he
says
he
has
an
income
of
$4972
they
were
checked
with
the
federal
tax
commission,
the
state
tax
commission
to
see
if
that
is
right.
turning
now
to
the
brief
moments
left
to
the
tax
relief
business.
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
the
question
of
tax
credit
versus
tax
exclusion
versus
tax
deduction
and
so
on.
a
typical
tax
credit
is
the
$12.50
that
every
new
york
resident
is
entitled
to
take
off
of
his
income
tax
after
he
figures
it
all
out,
and
he
figures
that
he
has
to
owe
$483.97
and
then
just
for
being
a
taxpayer,
he
is
allowed
a
flat
cancellation
of
$12.50
of
that
money
whether
he
is
a
millionaire
or
whether
he
is
a
pauper.
that
is
an
example
of
a
tax
credit.
tax
exemption,
i
think,
the
best
example
is
what
your
honor
has
held
in
walls
namely,
a
particular
person
or
institution
who
just
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
taxes
or
doesn't
have
to
pay
a
particular
category
of
taxes.
this
is
just
what
the
statute
describes
it.
it
is
a
tax
modification
and
it
comes
off
as
mr.
justice
stewart
observed,
it
comes
off
the
top
rather
than
from
the
bottom.
section
5
comes
to
the
court
with
this
strong
legislative
finding
which
i
am
going
to
read.
such
educational
institutions,
that
refers
to
all
the
institutions
covered
by
the
act,
religious
and
non-religious,
such
educational
institutions
not
only
provide
education
for
the
children
attending
them,
but
by
their
existence
relieve
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
of
the
burden
of
providing
public
school
education
for
those
children.
that
finding
was
adopted
almost
ipsissimis
verbis
in
the
district
court.
as
with
the
tuition
reimbursement,
i
emphasize
that
this
is
only
partial
relief.
the
beneficiary
is
the
parent
and
not
the
school.
there
is
no
grant
from
the
treasury.
there
is
a
secular
intent,
namely
equity
and
the
benefit
is
not
through,
if
any
to
religious
schools
that
are
so
remote
as
to
are
not
to
involve
them
permissible
entanglement.
and
there
is
a
minimum
amount
of
administrative
entanglement.
all
those
were
specifically
spelled
out
by
the
district
court,
as
reasons
for
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
this
act.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
say,
repeat
that
the
state
has
wide
authority
in
classifications,
in
tax
things
and
there
is
no
person
that
i
know
of
for
holding
this
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
said,
in
holding
that
their
secular
purpose
as
well
as
the
facts
were
strong,
the
lightening
of
the
tax
burden
of
those
who
contribute
to
public
education
while
deriving
no
benefit
from
it
for
themselves,
albeit
this
is
a
voluntary
choice,
is
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
i
accordingly
request,
your
honors
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reversed
as
to
tuition
refund
section
and
that
section
be
held
constitutional
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
as
to
the
tax
modification
be
affirmed
and
that
likewise
be
held
constitutional.
thank
you.

paid
to
the
school.
he
does
not
--
that's
his
money,
he
has
already
paid
the
school.
there
is
no
connection
between
the
two
of
them.
it
is
perfectly
open
to
that
parent
to
say
i
don’t
like
this
school
any
longer.
i
won’t
bring
my
child
back
next
year,
i’ll
take
him
out.
and
it
is
all
right
for
him
to
say
“i’ve
got
$50.00
here
from
the
state,
it
is
a
win
for
all,
i
will
go
spend
it
at
the
races.”
or
if
he
is
feeling
more
charitable,
he
will
say
to
his
wife,
“in
lieu
of
the
price
of
steaks,
i
am
going
to
give
you
this
money,
you
can
go
downtown
and
buy
a
good
nice
steak
to
celebrate
with.”
there
is
no
accounting.
in
the
assertion
this
morning
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
he
knew
that
the
money
was
coming.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
just
as
the
parent,
the
parent
who
paid
the
bus
company
in
everson,
he
knew
he
was
going
to
get
it
back
but
when
he
got
it
back,
it
was
his
money
i
think,
your
honor.
there
was
discussion
this
morning
of
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights
as
an
example
of
this
tuition
business.
i
could
--
we
have
listed
in
our
brief
various
other
similar
items
such
as
the
region
scholarship
and
the
scholar
incentive
programs
in
new
york
state
and
i
shall
develop
those
further.
as
to
entanglement,
this
tuition
refund
requires
a
minimum
of
entanglement.
there
must
be
a
verification
the
children
are
actually
enrolled
at
schools,
no
entanglement
there.
a
verification
that
tuition
has
been
paid,
then
a
verification
that
the
individual
in
question
is
not
telling
different
stories
to
the
people
to
whom
he
is
asking
for
the
tax
refund
and
the
tax
authority.
in
other
words,
if
he
says
he
has
an
income
of
$4972
they
were
checked
with
the
federal
tax
commission,
the
state
tax
commission
to
see
if
that
is
right.
turning
now
to
the
brief
moments
left
to
the
tax
relief
business.
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
the
question
of
tax
credit
versus
tax
exclusion
versus
tax
deduction
and
so
on.
a
typical
tax
credit
is
the
$12.50
that
every
new
york
resident
is
entitled
to
take
off
of
his
income
tax
after
he
figures
it
all
out,
and
he
figures
that
he
has
to
owe
$483.97
and
then
just
for
being
a
taxpayer,
he
is
allowed
a
flat
cancellation
of
$12.50
of
that
money
whether
he
is
a
millionaire
or
whether
he
is
a
pauper.
that
is
an
example
of
a
tax
credit.
tax
exemption,
i
think,
the
best
example
is
what
your
honor
has
held
in
walls
namely,
a
particular
person
or
institution
who
just
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
taxes
or
doesn't
have
to
pay
a
particular
category
of
taxes.
this
is
just
what
the
statute
describes
it.
it
is
a
tax
modification
and
it
comes
off
as
mr.
justice
stewart
observed,
it
comes
off
the
top
rather
than
from
the
bottom.
section
5
comes
to
the
court
with
this
strong
legislative
finding
which
i
am
going
to
read.
such
educational
institutions,
that
refers
to
all
the
institutions
covered
by
the
act,
religious
and
non-religious,
such
educational
institutions
not
only
provide
education
for
the
children
attending
them,
but
by
their
existence
relieve
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
of
the
burden
of
providing
public
school
education
for
those
children.
that
finding
was
adopted
almost
ipsissimis
verbis
in
the
district
court.
as
with
the
tuition
reimbursement,
i
emphasize
that
this
is
only
partial
relief.
the
beneficiary
is
the
parent
and
not
the
school.
there
is
no
grant
from
the
treasury.
there
is
a
secular
intent,
namely
equity
and
the
benefit
is
not
through,
if
any
to
religious
schools
that
are
so
remote
as
to
are
not
to
involve
them
permissible
entanglement.
and
there
is
a
minimum
amount
of
administrative
entanglement.
all
those
were
specifically
spelled
out
by
the
district
court,
as
reasons
for
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
this
act.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
say,
repeat
that
the
state
has
wide
authority
in
classifications,
in
tax
things
and
there
is
no
person
that
i
know
of
for
holding
this
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
said,
in
holding
that
their
secular
purpose
as
well
as
the
facts
were
strong,
the
lightening
of
the
tax
burden
of
those
who
contribute
to
public
education
while
deriving
no
benefit
from
it
for
themselves,
albeit
this
is
a
voluntary
choice,
is
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
i
accordingly
request,
your
honors
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reversed
as
to
tuition
refund
section
and
that
section
be
held
constitutional
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
as
to
the
tax
modification
be
affirmed
and
that
likewise
be
held
constitutional.
thank
you.
