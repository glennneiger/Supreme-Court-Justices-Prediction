mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
three
parts
of
chapter
414
of
new
york
laws,
1972.
that
act
consists
of
five
parts.
part
one
provides
public
funds
for
the
maintenance
and
repair
of
non-public
schools.
part
two,
provides
funds
for
tuition
in
such
schools,
of
parents
whose
income
does
not
exceed
$5,000
a
year.
part
three
provides
a
tax
credits
to
parents,
children
taking
such
schools
whose
income
exceeds
$5,000
a
year.
part
four
provides
public
funds
to
public
school
districts
impact
aid
funds
whose
enrollment
increases
by
reason
of
the
closing
down
of
nonpublic
schools
in
that
district,
and
part
five
empowers
the
public
schools
districts
in
those
areas
to
purchase
unused
or
no
longer
used
nonpublic
schools.
the
suit
challenges
only
the
first
three
parts
under
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
held
unanimously
that
part
one
and
part
two
are
unconstitutional.
by
a
divided
vote,
with
judge
hays
dissenting,
it
held
constitutional
the
third
part,
the
tax
credit
part
and
also
held
that,
that
part
was
severable
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
judge
hays
dissented
on
both
parts,
now
taking
each
of
these
parts
to
seriatim,
the
maintenance
and
repair
part,
the
statute
is
quite
broad
in
what
constitutes
maintenance
and
repair,
indeed
it's
open
ended.
it
defines
maintenance
and
repair
as
the
provision
of
heat,
light,
water,
ventilation
and
sanitary
facilities;
cleaning,
janitorial
and
custodial
services;
snow
removal;
necessary
upkeep
and
renovation
of
buildings,
grounds
and
equipment;
fire
and
accident
protection;
and
such
other
items
as
the
commissioner,
as
the
state
commissioner
of
education
may
deem
necessary
to
ensure
the
health,
welfare
and
safety
of
enrolled
pupils.
indeed
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
except
for
teacher
salaries,
this
statute
permits
practically
the
state
and
directs
the
state
to
pick
up
the
bill
for
everything
in
those
schools.
now,
the
only
qualifications
under
the
statute
are
that
the
schools
be
located
in
low
income
areas.
the
amount
given
to
the
schools
for
that
purpose
is
$30
per
pupil
in
attendance
and
an
additional
$10.00
if
the
school
is
more
than
25
years
old.
now,
in
lemon
against
kurtzman
and
earley
against
dicenso,
this
court
in
1971
declared
unconstitutional
the
state
laws
in
pennsylvania
and
rhode
island
which
appropriated
public
funds
to
pay
for
the
secular
teaching
in
religious
schools.
on
the
same
day,
the
court
decided
these
cases,
it
decided
tilton
against
richardson
which
upheld
on
its
face,
not
necessarily
as
applied,
indeed
quite
clearly
not
as
applied,
a
federal
statute
which
appropriated
funds
to
pay
half
the
cost
of
constructing
facilities,
colleges.
now,
in
tilton
against
richardson,
the
plurality
opinion,
there
was
no
court
opinion,
distinguished
the
federal
statute,
the
add
from
the
statutes
in
the
pennsylvania
and
rhode
island
cases.
the
court
said,
in
the
first
place,
the
federal
statute
deals
with
colleges
and
universities,
and
there
was
a
rare
latitude
given
by
the
establishment
clause,
under
in
such
circumstances,
because
the
students
are
mature,
they
can
resist
pressure
by
the
teachers,
sectarian
pressure
in
other
reasons
and
therefore
the
limits
of
governmental
action
are
somewhat
broader,
are
broader
than
those
in
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
secondly,
the
court
pointed
out
that
we
had
there
a
one-time
grant
in
each
of
those
cases.
the
money
is
given
to
that
state
whereas
in
the
dicenso
and
lemon
cases,
there
was
ongoing
payments
each
year,
therefore
there
was
a
greater
area
of
governmental
involvement.
finally,
the
court
pointed
out
that
in
the
federal
grant,
the
tilton
grant,
the
statute
specifically
forbade
the
use
of
any
of
those
facilities
partly
financed
with
public
funds
to
be
used
for
religious
purposes
and
indeed
in
that
case,
the
court
held
unconstitutional
by
unanimously
that
part
of
the
federal
statute
which
restricted,
which
removed
this
limitation
after
20
years.
after
20
years
under
the
statute,
those
federally
financed
facilities
could
be
used
for
religious
instruction;
the
court
said
this
is
unconstitutional.
no
funds
which
come
from
governmental
body
maybe
used
to
finance
any
facility
used
in
whole
or
in
part
for
religious
instruction
or
worship.
now,
in
the
present
case,
the
statute
applies
to
elementary
and
secondary
schools
not
to
colleges.
moreover
it
is
not
a
one-time-grant,
but
it's
--
you
have
to
renew
it
each
year,
and
perhaps
above
all,
the
statute
does
not
forbid
the
use
of
the
facilities
so
financed
governmental
funds
for
religious
or
sectarian
purposes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
part
one,
part
one.
the
same
rooms
which
are
financed,
whose
lighting,
whose
ventilation
whose
upkeep,
whose
renovation,
is
financed
with
state
funds
are
used
for
sectarian
instruction
and
religious
worship.
if
that
was
a
chapel
in
school
as
many
of
the
schools
to
have
chapels,
that
chapel
too
is
part
of
the
cost
of
maintenance
and
repair
borne
by
the
state.
the
statute
provides
that
only
50%
of
the
average
state
cost
of
maintenance
and
repair
of
public
schools
maybe
appropriated
towards
these
schools,
and
in
no
case
more
than
100
%
of
money
is
actually
used
for
these
purposes
in
the
parochial
schools
maybe
used.
but
there
is
no
distinction
within
the
statute
between
those
parts
of
the
bill
indeed
it's
questionable
whether
it
could
be,
but
those
parts
of
building
used
for
religious
purposes
and
those
for
sectarian
purposes.
now
i
do
not
believe.
and
in
fact
as
i
read
the
briefs,
there
is
i
believe
an
implicit
admission
that
if
this
statute
applied
to
all
nonpublic
schools,
it
would
clearly
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
denied.
there
was
an
effort
to
justify
the
statute
on
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
provide
for
safety
and
health
of
students.
while
the
police
power
has
to
be
exercised
within
the
restrictions
of
the
first
amendment.
in
flast
against
cohen,
this
court
held
that
there
is
an
express
provision
in
the
constitution,
the
first
amendment
forbidding
governmental
financing
of
parochial
schools.
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
court
has
held
that
where
there
is
an
express
provision
in
the
constitution
that
can't
be
transgressed
under
the
police
power.
the
police
power
of
the
state
is
inherent.
it
is
used
to
--
the
word
police,
it's
origin
is
the
use
of
security
and
safety
for
people,
to
arrest
criminals
or
those
who
are
charged
with
crime
and
to
try
them,
convict
them,
and
punish
them,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
the
police
power.
a
state
can't
violate
an
express
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
let
us
say
or
trial
without
jury
or
trial
without
counsel.
surely
the
police
--
the
public
has
an
interest,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
education
of
children,
but
it
must
be
exercised
in
such
way
that
it
does
not
follow
a
specific
prohibition
of
the
bill
of
rights.
no
matter
how
wise,
no
matter
how
effective
a
trial
without
jury,
or
double
jeopardy,
or
trial
without
counsel
would
be
in
preventing
crimes
speaks,
that
cannot
stand,
that
cannot
justify
a
specific
prohibition
in
the
constitution
in
the
bill
of
rights.
and,
in
fact,
in
cole
the
whole
base
of
the
decision
was
that
the
statute
clause
is
a
specific
prohibition,
the
first
prohibition
in
the
bill
of
rights
against
a
financing
of
the
operations
of
parochial
schools.
the
state
seems
to,
also
indeed
clearly
bases
its
position
on
this,
in
this
part
that
this
statute
is
limited
to
schools
in
low-income
areas.
again,
i
know
of
no
decision
of
any
court
holding
that
to
be
a
critical,
or
relevant
constitutional
question,
where
the
question
is
equal
protection.
if
the
state
chooses
a
certain
class
as
beneficiaries
of
its
action
and
excludes
other
classes
as
for
example,
if
the
state
provides
free
counsel
in
criminal
case
which
indeed
it
must,
to
poor
people
but
not
to
wealthy
people
or
provide
free
access
to
the
divorce
cases,
indeed
it
must
for
poor
people
not
to
wealthy
people
or
other
cases
it
does
not
provides
the
transcripts
of
criminal
trial
to
put
but
not
the
wealthy
people.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
indigents,
the
indigents.
if
the
state
--
then
quite
clearly
this
would
not
--
this
is
a
rational
classification
not
quite
like
the
equal
protection
but
the
state
could
constitutionally
provide
free
access
with
divorce
courts,
to
faculty
courts,
to
free
transcripts,
to
public
defense
service,
to
all,
to
the
indeed,
it
does
in
public
schools.
public
schools
are
open
to
everybody,
the
wealthiest
as
well
as
the
most
poor,
and
it
is
not
a
violation
of
equal
protection
because
of
the
reasonable
classification
whether,
if
the
state
chooses
one
alternative
free
for
all
or
the
other
type
of
free
only
for
the
poor,
the
indigent.
but
that
never
has
been
used
to
say
that
the
state
can
violate
an
express
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
where
individual
who
are
involved
where
they
cannot
violate
it,
where
the
(inaudible)
to
it.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
--
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
below
is
entirely
correct,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
for
the
state
to
provide
funds
for
the
maintenance
and
repair
of
schools
which
are
used
in
part
at
least
for
religious
education
or
religious
question.
the
only
case
which
can
remotely
justify
this
statute
and
very
remotely,
is
the
everson
case
in
which
the
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
paying,
reimbursing
parents
for
the
expenses
of
sending
their
children
on
public
bus
to
parochial
schools.
mr.
justice
black
for
majority
of
the
court
stated
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
protect
the
children
from
the
hazards
of
the
road.
well,
we
do
not
deny,
we
cannot
deny
because
the
of
prior
decision
of
this
court
which
seem
to
take
a
position
that
you
cannot
go
behind
what
the
legislative
state
in
its
declaration
of
purposes.
therefore
we
must
assume
that
the
purposes
of
this
statute
the
same,
but
the
effect
is
probably
different,
you
do
not
teach
religion
or
practice
religion
on
the
bus.
if
you
did,
if
a
private
owned
bus,
in
everson
it
was
a
publicly
owned
bus,
system
parents
got,
paid
back
for
the
money
which
they
paid
for
transportation
of
public
bus
but
if
you
did
under
mccollum
against
board
of
education,
going
way
back
to
1948
which
held
that
no
premises
publicly
owned,
publicly
financed
can
be
used
for
religious
teaching
or
religious
worship
even
for
as
much
as
a
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
a
week.
if
it
does
that,
it
is
unconstitutional,
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
mccollum
and
of
course
it
held
the
same
thing
in
engel
against
vitale,
the
prayer
case,
in
abington
township
involving
bible
reading
and
in
lemon
against
kurtzman.
so
we
believe
that
this
part
of
the
statute,
part
one,
was
quite
properly
held
unconstitutional
by
unanimous
vote
of
the
district
court.
part
two
deals
with
tuition
payments.
the
statute
provides
that
up
to
50
%
of
the
tuition
of
the
--
no,
i
believe
it
does
have
--
but
the
basic
provision
is
that
$50.00
is
paid
per
child
for
the
tuition
up
to
no
more
than
the
tuition
actually
is
--
for
the
tuition
paid
for
enrollment
in
nonpublic
schools.
the
question
of
tuition
grants
is
not
a
new
one,
unlike
the
maintenance
and
repair
and
tax
credits
which
are
quite
new
which
appear
to
be
a
recent.
tuition
grants
has
a
means
of
avoiding
constitutional
limitations
goes
back
at
least
a
century.
it
has
been
challenged
in
the
court
in
three
different
contexts.
first,
is
a
violation
of
state
constitutional
provisions
against
financing
parochial
schools.
second,
under
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
and
third
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
a
racial
segregation
context,
a
decision
growing
out
of
state
appropriations
of
public
funds
to
pay
for
the
tuition
of
pupils
in
racial
segregated
schools.
now,
my
own
research
and
i
am
not
volunteering
that
it
is
an
exhaustive,
indeed
as
i
have
indicated
a
moment,
i
did
overlooked
one
case
fortunately
which
would
support
to
my
position
not
oppose,
but
the
research
i
have
done
has
disclosed
not
a
single
decision
and
there
were
many,
many
which
considered
this
question,
not
a
single
decision
holding
that
there
was
a
constitutional
difference
between
a
direct
grant
of
public
funds
to
religious
schools
and
paying
whole
or
part
of
the
tuition
of
children
attending
those
schools.
the
cases
--
some
of
the
cases
there
are
many
others,
supporting
my
position
are
in
my
brief,
both
on
the
--
under
the
state
constitutions
establishment
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
the
(inaudible)
cases
decided
both
before
and
after
the
lemon,
dicenso
cases,
there
were
three,
i
point
out
three
in
my
brief,
there
is
actually
a
fourth
one,
i
must,
i
say
overlooked
things,
i
argued
the
case
but
it
slipped
my
memory.
there
were
four
cases
in
which
the
us
district
courts,
in
each
case
a
three-judge
court
passed
upon
the
question.
one
was
wolman
against
essex
in
ohio
which
this
court
affirmed
without
argument.
the
other
is
this
case,
the
third
is
the
case
which
will
be
argued
day
after
this
one,
lemon
against
kurtzman.
the
fourth
which
i
did
not
cite
in
my
brief
as
i
said
which
i
slipped
my
memory
is
lemon
against
sloan,
where
--
i
mean
it's
nebraska
against
missouri,
nebraska
against
missouri
where
district
court
in
missouri
was
faced
with
a
challenge
by
parents
of
children
in
parochial
schools
to
the
state
constitution
and
the
state
practice
of
excluding
parochial
schools
from
governmental
financing.
the
parents
claimed
that
this
is
a
violation
of
religious
freedom
and
equal
protection.
the
suit
was
started
before
the
decision
in
lemon
against
dicenso.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
may
i
just
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
i
think
you
are
right
--
technically
you
are
right
and
to
some
extent
this
is
what
the
state
of
new
york
contends,
as
distinguishes
them,
but
actually
it's
only
technically
right
because
chapter
414
is
a
single
package.
it
takes
care
of
children,
parents
of
children
with
incomes
under
$5,000
through
a
tuition
grant.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
takes
care
of
children,
or
parents
of
children
with
incomes
over
$5,000.00
through
a
tax
credit.
children
over
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
part
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
but
as
i
say
this
is
one
single
fact
and
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
part
two
if
it
were
--
if
it
could
be
severed
from
the
rest
is
applied
to
parents
of
children
with
incomes
not
more
than
$5,000.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
case
is
--
this
case
is
different
from
the
--
it
is
not
however
constitutionally
distinguishable.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
--
in
my
position.
so
the
reason
which
i
stated
in
respect
to
part
one.
that
too
limiting
itself
as
it
does
to
schools
in
low-income
areas
is
also
so
purposed
and
so
applied,
but
as
i
said
it's
our
position
--
it's
our
position
that
you
have
as
all
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
and
before
any
court
have
held
that
it
cannot
pay
the
tuition
for
persons
attending
nonpublic
schools
where
either
equal
protection
or
most
specifically
in
this
case,
an
express
prohibition
of
the
statute
is
involved,
the
fact
that
it
is
limited
to
one
particular
class
of
low-incomes
does
not
justify,
which
otherwise
would
be
an
express
prohibition
against
financing
of
religious
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
afdc
payments
or
payments
for
poor
children
and
the
families
which
are
used
by
those
families
for
their
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
specific
provision
of
their
tuition
to
that.
and
with
--
that
is
as
far
as
i
know,
i
believe
for
what
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
do
not
know
for
people
beyond
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
sure,
as
far
as
i
know
the
reason
there
is
no
such
provision
that
is
similar
to
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights
which
goes
to
everybody
--
if
it
were
--
if
there
were
specific
grant
in
there
and
i
am
fairly
confident
of
it,
a
specific
grant
there
for
tuition
to
schools
and
that
tuition
was
payable
to
schools
which
teach
and
practice
religion,
i
believe
will
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
in
the
first
place
this
indeed
is
pointed
out
in
the
various
briefs.
this
case,
this
question
and
the
question
set
–
posed
by
justice
stewart,
also
has
been
considered
in
many
of
the
cases
which
i've
referred
to,
considered
the
past.
in
respect
to
the
poverty
or
indigents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
very
case
the
majority
of
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
fact
that
this
is
--
this
money
goes
to
in
part
one,
goes
to
indigent
schools,
it
goes
in
indigent
or
in
low-income
areas,
is
almost
--
i
differentiate
this
from
the
tax
credits
for
unconstitutionality.
it
says
tax
credits
across
the
board
whereas
the
low-income
housing
--
low-income
schools
are
mostly
catholic
schools,
therefore
a
specific
religious
group
is
benefited
and
therefore
it's
unconstitutional
even
though
they
held
tax
credit
constitutional.
now,
in
respect
to
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
the
least.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
the
least,
i
am
just
pointing
to
the
court
below
is
using
this
argument
just
the
reversed
way.
i
am
not
--
i
am
saying
that
in
every
case,
in
every
case
which
came
to
the
court
to
this
court,
lemon,
dicenso
and
which
all
the
other
courts,
the
argument
has
always
been,
it
is
stated
in
the
declaration
purpose
that
was
out
this
money
from
the
government,
the
poor
people
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
an
education.
that's
the
basis
of
argument
every
case
and
as
court
has
deemed
it,
even
in
the
dicenso,
the
law
they
have
distinguished
between
indigent
and
non-indigent,
the
poor
and
non-poor
school,
it
provided
that
the
money
can
only
go
to
those
schools
where
the
cost,
the
salaries
paid
to
teachers
are
less
than
the
salaries
paid
in
public
schools,
that
is
poor
schools,
those
with
the
lower
payment
therefore
that
in
poor
schools
where
and
the
argument
--
the
argument
in
those
cases
was
that
without
this
money,
poor
people
would
not
be
able
to
go
to
private
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
might
very
well.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
except
on
private
and
if
you
go
to
colleges.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
indeed
i
believe
it
would,
i
believe
to
that
extend,
it
would.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
the
difference
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
necessarily,
because
this
answers
the
question
which
the
chief
justice
raised.
these
moneys
go
to
these
parents
and
it
become
as
their
funds.
they
have
a
certain
degree
of
flexibility
to
what
they
used
if
there
must.
it's
so
true
with
the
gi
bill,
in
the
form
of
law
one,
the
gi
did
not
get
gi
benefits
as
they
did
in
world
war
ii,
they
got
bonuses
and
they
used
that
bonus
for
a
lot
of
purpose.
some
of
them
even
gave
it
away
to
churches,
which
they
had
a
right
to
do
it?
it
was
their
money.
it
was
paid
to
them
in
compensation
for
the
services
of
which
they
rendered
to
its
income.
there
was
a
no
stings
attached.
now,
because
many
of
the
parent
--
of
the
soldiers
use
this
money
unwisely,
they
setup
businesses,
they
gave
it
away,
they
gambled
it
away.
in
world
war
ii,
it
decide
to
put
stings
attached
and
said
this,
the
rationale
of
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights.
we
have
taken
a
group
of
american
young
men
away
from
their
lives
and
we
have
put
them
into
the
army
to
serve
the
nation.
during
that
period,
their
more
fortunate
or
other
contemporaries
didn't
have
to
do
this
and
could
continue
their
education
in
order
to
make,
to
earn
a
livelihood,
they
can
go
to
college,
they
can
go
to
trade
school,
they
can
even
go
to
seminaries
to
become
clergy
man
and
make
a
living
that
way.
now
one
way
to
send
the
survivors
of
the
armed
forces
back,
they
had
lost
three,
or
four,
five
years
of
their
preparatory
years,
and
instead
of
giving
them
unrestricted
money
as
in
world
war
i,
because
of
the
unfortunate
experience
there,
we
don't
say
you
have
got
to
use
this
money,
to
give
you
some
possibility
of
making
up
and
earning
a
livelihood
and
there
ought
to
be
used
only
for
preparation
to
earn
a
livelihood
to
give
you
a
some
money
for
that
purpose,
and
you
might
even
argue,
it's
not
you
set
aside,
that
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
of
religious
liberty
if
the
states
--
if
the
government
said
any
livelihood
you
want
accepting
your
inclusion.
i
am
not
arguing
with
that
one
way
or
other,
it's
not
necessary,
but
that
was
--
that
was
the
g.i.
bill
looked
like.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
the
money
was
used
by
them
for
any
purpose,
it's
their
money.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
this
case
the
money
could
only
be
used
for
that
purpose,
unless
they
come
back,
unless
the
parent
comes
with
a
receipted
bills
from
a
private
school
and
as
my
--
the
record
shows,
the
brief
shows.
96
%
of
the
schools
in
new
york
which
are
private
are
religious
schools.
so,
a
full
part
of
purpose
that
means
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
certainly.
yes.
yes,
there
are
below
4
%
of
the
schools
and
i
don't
think
--
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
token
could
really
save
the
country.
it
didn't
lemon
against
--
it
did
in
the
lemon
case,
it
did
in
the
dicenso,
it
did
in
the
wolman
against
--
a
case
which
the
two
wolmans,
the
two
assets
cases
which
one
was
already
been
affirmed
without
opinion,
it
was
a
unanimous
case
and
all
those
cases,
no
case
that
i
know
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
the
money
went
for
tuition,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
constitutionally
distinct.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
it's
still
--
it's
still
a
money
for
tuition.
it
isn't
a
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
they
are
relevant
mostly
towards
the
third
point
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
this
court,
in
your
honor's
opinion
in
lemon
and
dicenso
that
and
in
walz
too,
your
honor's
opinion
in
walz,
that
these
statutes
are
all
directed
for
practically
one
religious
group,
and
i
am
just
relying
on
like
your
honor
said
in
those
cases.
none
of
them
(voice
overlap)
all
of
the
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
that's
why
your
honor
upheld
the
walz
decision
because
of
that
pointed
out
--
you
pointed
out
that
it
is
not
directed
to
one
religious
group
and
that's
how
you
run
and
distinguished.
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
in
respect
to
the
what
the
--
the
court
pointed
out
both
in
walz
and
lemon
and
dicenso,
the
division
of
the
community
on
religious
grounds
and
the
entanglement
involved
in
political
attempt
in
bringing
in
this
issue
in
political
areas
and
this
was
one
of
the
things
which
this
court
have
attended
to
prohibit
and
it
is
relevant
in
waltz
towards
constitutionality
was
relevant
in
lemon
and
dicenso
towards
unconstitutionality.
now
i
suggest
it
is
relevant
here
towards
unconstitutionality
as
well
and
this
is
not
created
by
me
out
of
thin
air.
it
was
brought
in
by
two
decisions.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
there
was
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
yes.
i
just
add
that
i
believe
that
even
if
they
were
all
religious
--
it's
all
religious
affair
because
i
think
the
court
and
this
court
in
everson
and
mccollum
in
the
(inaudible)
cases
and
torcaso
against
watkins
forbade
aiding
one
religion
or
all
religions,
and
it
make
no
distinction,
and
i
think
will
be
unconstitutional
whether
it
is
one
religion
or
all
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
answer
i
say
your
honor,
is
that
this
was
not
even
restricted
to
religion.
this
was
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
indeed.
one
of
my
--
just
as
the
bus
transportation
went
to
religious
and
nonreligious
schools,
but
indeed
that's
true
but
there
was
no
money
paid
for
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
no
--
there
is
not
here
in
a
sense
that
it
is
not
paid
directly
but
there
is
here
in
the
sense
that
the
money
is
paid
only
if
you
pay
tuition
in
the
religious
schools,
if
only
if
you
pay
tuition
in
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
private
school.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
private
schools.
96
%
of
which
are
religious
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
it
did.
it
didn't
originally
but
it
did
go
through
the
hands
of
the
recipients
after
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
was
changed
after
the
--
the
question
was
brought
before
congress,
and
they
realized
that
there
was
a
constitutional
problem
thereafter
the
change
of
law,
that
the
tuition
money
went
directly
to
the
g.i.
not
to
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
the
g.i.
became
but
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
he
could
use
the
tuition
anywhere
he
wanted.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
only
for
tuition,
they
could
use
it
only
for
tuition,
but
for
tuition
in
any
college,
a
public
college
or
private.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
right,
he
can
use
it
for
any
college
but
in
respect
to
tuition
limited
specifically,
limited
specifically
except
for
4
%;
for
4
%
which
i
believe
it
is
token
and
put
in
i
don't
believe
it
could
purify
the
other
non
uses,
limited
specifically
to
religious
schools
in
96
%
of
the
cases,
i
do
not
believe
that
could
be
upheld
under
any
law.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
they
have
done
inspection,
those
standards
involved
surveillance
of
the
schools
in
the
sense
which
lemon
and
dicenso
i
believe
it
could
not
be
upheld
under
lemon
and
dicenso.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
that
was
that
the
court
pointed
that
out
in
lemon
and
dicenso.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
because,
it's
not
found
objectionable
but
when
it
becomes
two,
the
use
of
religious
funds,
the
court
found
it
objectionable
in
lemon
and
dicenso.
the
court
said
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
not
constitutionally
objectionable
but
on
the
other
hand,
that
fact
does
not
at
least
unless
this
court
overrules
lemon
and
dicenso,
that
fact
was
not
found
to
immunize
that
use
of
public
funds
for
religious,
for
schools
which
could
teach
religion
and
secular
subjects,
that's
what
the
court
held
in
lemon
and
dicenso
and
the
court,
indeed
as
recently
as
last
year
and
not
in
wisconsin
against
yoder.
this
court
repeated
that
statement,
the
court
repeated
it
and
i
should
like
to
just
quote
what
the
court
said,
as
it
recently
as
last
year
in
wisconsin
against
yoder,
found
page
14
of
my
brief.
long
before
there
was
general
acknowledgment
of
need
for
universal
formal
education,
the
religion
quotes
specifically
firmly
fix
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
religious
beliefs,
but
trusting
this
fund
more
right
was
unequally
framed,
even
if
equally
framed,
even
if
that's
explicit,
prohibition
against
the
statute
venue
religion
by
government.
the
values
underlying
these
two
provisions
were
linked
to
religion,
have
been
jealously
protect
sometimes
even
at
the
expense
of
other
interest
of
admissibly
high
social
importance.
the
invalidation
of
financial
aid
to
parochial
schools
by
government
grants
for
(inaudible)
is
but
in
this
regard
is
one
example
of
the
extent
to
which
the
courts
have
disregarded,
notwithstanding
that
such
aid
programs
were
legislatively
determined
to
be
in
public
interest
and
it
serves
the
sound
education
policy
by
state
and
congress,
citing
the
lemon
against
kurtzman,
tilton
against
richardson
and
everson
v.
board
of
education,
then
the
fact
of
those
cases
are
no
difference
than
the
facts
in
this
case
as
i
--
and
is
no
different
in
any
of
the
cases
the
four
district
court
cases
including
the
one
which
nebraska
against
missouri
which
i
have
not
cited.
all
those
cases,
there
were
12
judges,
four
from
the
court
of
appeals,
eight
from
the
district
court
deciding
on
tuition
grant,
not
one,
not
one
of
those
judges
now
held
that
tuition
grants
is
constitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
332
federal
sub
275,
405
us
1050
from
last
year.
1972.
now,
let
me
read
something.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
405
us
1050.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
97
--
then
let
me
say
what
a
moment
what
the
court
held
in
the
nebraska
case.
this
was
the
dicenso,
lemon
case
was
decided
after
the
suit
was
started,
and
the
court
in
that
respect
says,
“faced
with
this
decision,
the
plaintiffs
now
argue
that
some
alternative
program
such
as
tuition
grants
could
constitutionally
divide
which
--
that
so
they
can
self-content
which
be
free
of
government
entanglement.
the
court
rejected
that
and
said
--
and
i
don't
want
to
return
to
that
--
it
said
lemon
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
it
is
--
this
is
--
well
it's
somewhere
between
dictum
and
holding
but
the
court
said
that,
the
court
said
that
this
would
be
unconstitutional
too
under
the
lemon
and
we
breached
them,
wholly
apart
from
the
fact
that
entanglement
comparable
to
that
described
in
lemon
cannot
be
realistically
be
avoided;
if
plaintiffs
have
granted
aid
for
parochial
school
purposes,
particularly
on
a
continuing
basis.
it's
self
evident
both
the
purpose
and
affect
of
any
statute
from
tax
rate
funds
to
assist
parents,
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
would
necessarily
features
a
court
religion.
so
that
we
have
12
federal
court
judges,
not
one
of
them
finding
any
distinction
and
no
state
quotes
of
south
and
north,
both
in
this
context
and
the
equal
protection
racial
segregation,
not
one
of
them
finding
any
distinction
between
a
direct
grant
and
tuition.
now
i
must
devote
the
rest
of
my
time
unfortunately,
i
have
not
been
able
to
go
to
it,
but
i
must
speak
about
the
third,
the
tax
credit
part
which
indeed
the
most
important
because
that
seems
to
be
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing.
now,
i
concede,
if
tuition
grants
are
held
by
this
court
to
be
constitutionally
permissible
then
tax
credits
are
constitutionally
permissible.
that
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i
think
the
reverse
of
that
is
true.
i
think
the
reverse
of
that,
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
because
tax
credits
is
merely
one-fourth
of
paying
for
tuition.
now,
we're
not
speaking
about
tax
deductions,
we're
not
speaking
--
that's
not
before
this
court
although
--
we're
not
taking
about
tax
exemptions,
we're
not
speaking
tax
exemptions
nor
tax
deductions.
suppose
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
between
exemptions
or
between
deduction?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
might,
the
district
court
--
in
the
case
which
was
decided
after
this,
which
is
not
found
tax
exemption.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
just
want
to
answer
--
complete
my
answer
then
i
will
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
the
district
court
in
ohio
case
cited
in
brief
katya
(ph)
case
and
professor
froing
(ph)
among
others
are
the
opinion
that
there
is
no
difference
between
tax
credits
and
tax
deductions,
that
their
equally
unconstitutional.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
a
fairly
good
case
could
be
made
of
the
constitutionality
of
tax
deductions
for
tuition
paid
to
parochial
schools.
i
think
there
is
a
wall
of
a
difference
between
credits
and
deductions.
for
reasons
which
i
don't
want
to
--
which
i
state
in
my
brief
and
which
is
stated
by
the
court
below,
judge
garfield
(ph)
in
his
opinion,
stated
the
reasons
why
there
is
a
difference
between
tax
deductions,
tax
credits,
but
i
think
i
could
--
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
that
if
a
payment
for
tuition
to
parochial
school
what
treated
as
a
contribution
to
the
parochial
school,
in
other
words
it
would
be
deductible
to
that
amount
to
no
more
and
treat
like
the
contributions
to
a
church
which
are
tax
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
or
medical
deduction
itself.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
anything,
if
it
were
treated
as
a
deduction
then
i
think
that
it
could
--
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
for
its,
that
is
constitutional.
i
know
that's
a
poor
point
to
disagree
with
me
and
i
of
course,
respect
his
(inaudible)
of
constitutional
law
but
i
believe
it
can
be
made
but
where
the,
as
in
the
statute,
he
is
simply
reduced
the
tax
liability
by
a
certain
amount
and
instead
of
paying
the
government
like
you
owe
it,
you'd
reduce
an
amount
which
is
set
forth,
which
determined
by
the
statute
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
much
you
deduct,
how
much
your
tuition
is,
it
will
depend
upon
your
income
status
and
it's
--
i
can
see
no
difference
between
a
situation
where
you
owe
the
government
'x'
dollars
for
your
taxes
and
you
pay
the
government
that
amount.
the
government
sends
you
an
independent
check
for
your
tuition
which
you
owed,
which
you
have
paid
to
a
parochial
school.
i
see
no
constitutions
different
between
that
situation,
and
a
situation
where
instead
of
paying
the
government
of
what
you
owe
them
on
your
income
tax,
you'll
send
them
a
state
a
receipted
bill
for
your
tuition
and
you
deduct
that
amount
to
may
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
if
you
don't
have
and
you
get
under
the
new
---
they
will
give
you
the
money
in
the
form
of
tuition.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
under
a
statute.
so
you'll
get
the
money
from
a
state
loan
of
your
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
doesn't
do
them
any
good
because
i
--
and
therefore
in
this
state
--
in
this
statute,
they
give
you
the
cash
in
the
form
for
tuition.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
ohio
and
in
some
other
states,
they
give
you
a
negative
income
tax
rate.
they
pay
as
a
money
but
you
don't
pay
it.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
it
may
even
give
a
rise
to
a
question
on
establishment
clause
as
well.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
or
even
more
than
free
exercise
--
free
exercise
and
establishment
because
establishment
clauses
as
it
is
defined
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
equally
forbids
aid
to
religion
and
aid
to
anti-religion.
the
classic
expression
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh!
i
think
it
is
a
(inaudible)
school.
if
it
is
a
secular
school
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh!
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood,
i
thought
you
said
a
school.
no,
if
it's
a
purely
secular
school,
then
it's
a
public
school,
because
that's
what's
this
court
held
under
mccollum
and
engle
against
vitale
and
the
schempp
case.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
don't
see,
how
it's
–
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court
has
all
decided
on
the
nebraska
case,
the
nebraska
case,
that
was
the
argument
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
nebraska
case,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
because
nebraska,
the
case
which
i
cited
this
morning,
respect
to
a
suit
brought
by
parents
of
children
attending
private
schools
parochial
schools,
who
claimed
there
was
a
violation
of
free
exercise
because
the
private
schools
were
excluded/
the
district
court
unanimously
rejected
that
this
court
affirmed
without
any
dissent.
there
is
no,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
there
is
no
violation
of
equal
protection
in
the
classification
which
the
first
amendment
compels.
that's
what
this
court
held,
the
first
commendment
compels,
this
court
said
in
lemon,
dicenso,
compels
non
support
in
whole
or
in
part
of
parochial
schools.
so
if
the
first
amendment
compels
it
and
the
state
complied
with
it,
obviously
it's
not
following
the
action.
well,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
primarily
to,
but
i
wasn't
able
to
do
it,
this
morning,
the
tax
credit
provision.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
a
tax
credit
statute.
mrs.
coon
has
conceded
that
that's
not
tax
deduction
stuff.
the
court
below
called
it
a
tax
credit.
now
it
is
not
tax
deduction
statute
for
obvious
reasons.
in
the
tax
deduction,
you
deduct
from
a
gross
income
the
amount
you
have
contributed,
that's
what
you
do
when,
if
you
make
a
contribution
to
a
hospital,
to
an
art
museum,
to
a
church.
he
do
not
deduct.
the
state
figures
out
for
you
and
in
our
brief
and
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
all
the
parties
and
their
briefs,
the
state
figured
out,
on
page
six
of
my
brief,
the
amount
you
will
get,
benefit
you
will
get
by
the
deductions
and
it's
clear
that
the
benefits
stopped
where
the
tuition
grant
stops,
$50.00
per
child.
now
if
you
make,
i
will
make
a
contribution
of
$1000.00
to
a
church,
to
an
art
museum,
i
deduct
from
my
gross
income
$1000.00
and
then
my
income
tax
is
determined
on
the
balance.
if
i
pay
tuition
of
let’s
say
$50.00
for
each
child,
then
that
--
i
don't
deduct
$50.00
from
my
gross
income,
i
deduct
up
to
$1000.00
a
child,
up
to
$3000.00
from
my
gross
income,
why?
in
order
to
get
the
$50.00
which
will
be
allowed
to
me
per
child.
now
the
state
has
done
that
itself.
this
is
the
analysis
given
by
state
legislature.
it
is
simply
using
the
device
of
the
tax
system
to
achieve
a
payment
to
the
parents
of
children
in
pubic
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
do
it
in
several
ways.
first,
a
deduction
is
one
which
is
uniform
to
all,
in
respect
to
all
contributions.
there
is
no
difference
between
a
grant,
how
much
you
contribute
to
an
art
museum,
to
a
scientific
institution,
to
the
fpca
on
a
market
deduct
to
contribute
to
parochial
schools.
here
is
the
reason;
if
you
contribute
$50.00
to
the
art
museums,
you
deduct
$50.00
from
your
taxable
income.
here,
if
you
pay
$50.00,
you
don't
deduct
$50.00
from
taxable
income,
you
deduct
$1000.00.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say
that
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
in
this
context
yes.
in
this
context,
this
is
a
tax
credit.
it
would
be
a
tax
credit
if
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
is
a
broader
definition,
yes
indeed
and
indeed
mrs.
coon
did
conceded
that.
she
said
this
is
not
a
tax
deduction.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
deem
that
unconstitutional.
i
would
deem
that
unconstitutional
because
that
is
an
obvious
preference
of
aid
within
the
class
of
tax
credits.
in
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said,
i
believe
that's
unconstitutional
because
this
constitutes
a
benefit
exclusively
limited
to
those
who
send
their
children
to
parochial
schools.
it
would
be
both
equal
protection
and
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
any
event
what
this
--
what
this
title
implies,
it
recognized,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
not
a
tax
deduction
because
it
allows
you
this
money
even
if
you
deduct,
if
you
have
deductions
or
even
if
you
take
a
standardized
deduction,
you
don't
itemize.
you
have
already
got
the
benefit
of
deduction
and
whatever
it
is,
10%
or
whatever
it
is.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
you
still
get
this,
you
still
get
this
amount
even
if
you
have
already,
you
have
gotten
the
benefit.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
only
thing
i
can
answer
to
that
is
that
this
means
elevating
the
form
of
both
the
substances,
maybe
pretense
and
it
was
clear
because
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
tax
credit
and
as
all
the
--
my
opponent
say,
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
a
recognition
of
the
serious
finance
conditions
of
a
private
schools
and
the
non-private
education
and
put
one
statute,
all
these
things.
if
the
whole
purpose
of
this
is
to
get
money
into
the
private
school,
else,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
fails,
else
the
provisions
regarding
the
impacted
aids
have
no
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh!
no
because
no
tax
deduction
applies
equally
to
every
type
of
beneficiary
and
the
court
answer
that
in
walz
that
where
you
have
a
uniform
gift,
a
uniform
treatment
of
all
non-profit
organizations,
museums
and
so
on,
then
avoid
entanglement.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
that
tuition
--
services
rendered,
in
all
instances.
if
it
was
deductible
as
a
deduction,
in
other
words
the
amount
you
paid
is
deducted.
well,
i
think,
if
it's
deducted
from
your
gross
income,
i
think,
as
i
have
indicated
before
it
maybe
constitutional.
if
we
deduct
it
from
what
you
provided,
i
think
it
will
be
unconstitutional
and
that's
what
this,
what
has
it
done
here.
you
are
deducting
the
amount
in
tuition.
you
are
deducting
an
amount
which
the
state
figured
out
will
give
you
back
your
tuition,
$1000.00
per
child,
you
pay
tuition
$50.00.
you
will
get
a
deduction
of
$1000.00
up
to
$3000.00,
nor
to
--
nor
that
you
can
get
your
tax
liability
reduced
$50.00,
even
if
you’ve
already
gotten
a
deduction,
a
permnanet
or
standby
deduction.
and
the
state
says,
the
statute
says,
you
have
got
to
make
your
choice.
if
you
want
to
get
this
money,
you
have
two
ways.
you
can
get
through
a
benefit
of
this
or
you
can
get
through
a
benefit
of
the
tuition
grant
section.
they’re
both
the
same
purpose.
you
take
a
choice
here,
when
we
are
giving
you
$50.00
back,
one
way
or
the
other.
you
can
take
it
through
a
tuition
grant,
if
you
are
assuming
you’re
under
5000.
you
can
take
it
through
tuition
grant,
you
can
take
it
through
this,
but
obviously
the
purpose
in
both
cases
is
the
same.
now,
i
just
want
to
make
one
point
about
the
--
what
mr.
haggerty
said
about
the
fact
that
the
money
can't
be
used
in
respect
to
the
maintenance
and
repair
cannot
be
used
to
repair
the
heating
system
as
far
as
the
chapel
is
concerned
and
so
on.
assuming
that
is
so,
it
isn't
or
assuming
that
so,
that
thing
you
are
back
into
the
problem
of
entanglement.
that
propels
the
state
into
checking
how
your
money
is
used
and
an
average,
it's
not
enough
because
in
tilton,
only
50%
was
government
funds,
50%
was
government
funds,
the
other
50%
came
from
the
college
yet
the
supreme
court
said,
that
you
cannot
use
those
premises
for
religious
purposes
even
after
20
years,
even
for
one
lecture
in
religion,
even
for
one
mass
set.
after
20
years,
even
though
the
government
pays
only
half,
so
the
federal
government
pays
only
half
here,
does
not
remove
the
constitutional
thing.
the
government
cannot,
in
the
first
amendment,
pay
in
whole
or
in
part
for
the
maintenance
of
institutions
which
teach
or
practice
religion.
the
court
said
long
before
--
the
court
said
that
in
mccollum
against
maryland
where
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
school,
for
a
half
hour
to
an
hour
a
week
was
used
for
religious
education.
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
three
parts
of
chapter
414
of
new
york
laws,
1972.
that
act
consists
of
five
parts.
part
one
provides
public
funds
for
the
maintenance
and
repair
of
non-public
schools.
part
two,
provides
funds
for
tuition
in
such
schools,
of
parents
whose
income
does
not
exceed
$5,000
a
year.
part
three
provides
a
tax
credits
to
parents,
children
taking
such
schools
whose
income
exceeds
$5,000
a
year.
part
four
provides
public
funds
to
public
school
districts
impact
aid
funds
whose
enrollment
increases
by
reason
of
the
closing
down
of
nonpublic
schools
in
that
district,
and
part
five
empowers
the
public
schools
districts
in
those
areas
to
purchase
unused
or
no
longer
used
nonpublic
schools.
the
suit
challenges
only
the
first
three
parts
under
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
held
unanimously
that
part
one
and
part
two
are
unconstitutional.
by
a
divided
vote,
with
judge
hays
dissenting,
it
held
constitutional
the
third
part,
the
tax
credit
part
and
also
held
that,
that
part
was
severable
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
judge
hays
dissented
on
both
parts,
now
taking
each
of
these
parts
to
seriatim,
the
maintenance
and
repair
part,
the
statute
is
quite
broad
in
what
constitutes
maintenance
and
repair,
indeed
it's
open
ended.
it
defines
maintenance
and
repair
as
the
provision
of
heat,
light,
water,
ventilation
and
sanitary
facilities;
cleaning,
janitorial
and
custodial
services;
snow
removal;
necessary
upkeep
and
renovation
of
buildings,
grounds
and
equipment;
fire
and
accident
protection;
and
such
other
items
as
the
commissioner,
as
the
state
commissioner
of
education
may
deem
necessary
to
ensure
the
health,
welfare
and
safety
of
enrolled
pupils.
indeed
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
except
for
teacher
salaries,
this
statute
permits
practically
the
state
and
directs
the
state
to
pick
up
the
bill
for
everything
in
those
schools.
now,
the
only
qualifications
under
the
statute
are
that
the
schools
be
located
in
low
income
areas.
the
amount
given
to
the
schools
for
that
purpose
is
$30
per
pupil
in
attendance
and
an
additional
$10.00
if
the
school
is
more
than
25
years
old.
now,
in
lemon
against
kurtzman
and
earley
against
dicenso,
this
court
in
1971
declared
unconstitutional
the
state
laws
in
pennsylvania
and
rhode
island
which
appropriated
public
funds
to
pay
for
the
secular
teaching
in
religious
schools.
on
the
same
day,
the
court
decided
these
cases,
it
decided
tilton
against
richardson
which
upheld
on
its
face,
not
necessarily
as
applied,
indeed
quite
clearly
not
as
applied,
a
federal
statute
which
appropriated
funds
to
pay
half
the
cost
of
constructing
facilities,
colleges.
now,
in
tilton
against
richardson,
the
plurality
opinion,
there
was
no
court
opinion,
distinguished
the
federal
statute,
the
add
from
the
statutes
in
the
pennsylvania
and
rhode
island
cases.
the
court
said,
in
the
first
place,
the
federal
statute
deals
with
colleges
and
universities,
and
there
was
a
rare
latitude
given
by
the
establishment
clause,
under
in
such
circumstances,
because
the
students
are
mature,
they
can
resist
pressure
by
the
teachers,
sectarian
pressure
in
other
reasons
and
therefore
the
limits
of
governmental
action
are
somewhat
broader,
are
broader
than
those
in
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
secondly,
the
court
pointed
out
that
we
had
there
a
one-time
grant
in
each
of
those
cases.
the
money
is
given
to
that
state
whereas
in
the
dicenso
and
lemon
cases,
there
was
ongoing
payments
each
year,
therefore
there
was
a
greater
area
of
governmental
involvement.
finally,
the
court
pointed
out
that
in
the
federal
grant,
the
tilton
grant,
the
statute
specifically
forbade
the
use
of
any
of
those
facilities
partly
financed
with
public
funds
to
be
used
for
religious
purposes
and
indeed
in
that
case,
the
court
held
unconstitutional
by
unanimously
that
part
of
the
federal
statute
which
restricted,
which
removed
this
limitation
after
20
years.
after
20
years
under
the
statute,
those
federally
financed
facilities
could
be
used
for
religious
instruction;
the
court
said
this
is
unconstitutional.
no
funds
which
come
from
governmental
body
maybe
used
to
finance
any
facility
used
in
whole
or
in
part
for
religious
instruction
or
worship.
now,
in
the
present
case,
the
statute
applies
to
elementary
and
secondary
schools
not
to
colleges.
moreover
it
is
not
a
one-time-grant,
but
it's
--
you
have
to
renew
it
each
year,
and
perhaps
above
all,
the
statute
does
not
forbid
the
use
of
the
facilities
so
financed
governmental
funds
for
religious
or
sectarian
purposes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
part
one,
part
one.
the
same
rooms
which
are
financed,
whose
lighting,
whose
ventilation
whose
upkeep,
whose
renovation,
is
financed
with
state
funds
are
used
for
sectarian
instruction
and
religious
worship.
if
that
was
a
chapel
in
school
as
many
of
the
schools
to
have
chapels,
that
chapel
too
is
part
of
the
cost
of
maintenance
and
repair
borne
by
the
state.
the
statute
provides
that
only
50%
of
the
average
state
cost
of
maintenance
and
repair
of
public
schools
maybe
appropriated
towards
these
schools,
and
in
no
case
more
than
100
%
of
money
is
actually
used
for
these
purposes
in
the
parochial
schools
maybe
used.
but
there
is
no
distinction
within
the
statute
between
those
parts
of
the
bill
indeed
it's
questionable
whether
it
could
be,
but
those
parts
of
building
used
for
religious
purposes
and
those
for
sectarian
purposes.
now
i
do
not
believe.
and
in
fact
as
i
read
the
briefs,
there
is
i
believe
an
implicit
admission
that
if
this
statute
applied
to
all
nonpublic
schools,
it
would
clearly
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
denied.
there
was
an
effort
to
justify
the
statute
on
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
provide
for
safety
and
health
of
students.
while
the
police
power
has
to
be
exercised
within
the
restrictions
of
the
first
amendment.
in
flast
against
cohen,
this
court
held
that
there
is
an
express
provision
in
the
constitution,
the
first
amendment
forbidding
governmental
financing
of
parochial
schools.
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
court
has
held
that
where
there
is
an
express
provision
in
the
constitution
that
can't
be
transgressed
under
the
police
power.
the
police
power
of
the
state
is
inherent.
it
is
used
to
--
the
word
police,
it's
origin
is
the
use
of
security
and
safety
for
people,
to
arrest
criminals
or
those
who
are
charged
with
crime
and
to
try
them,
convict
them,
and
punish
them,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
the
police
power.
a
state
can't
violate
an
express
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
let
us
say
or
trial
without
jury
or
trial
without
counsel.
surely
the
police
--
the
public
has
an
interest,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
education
of
children,
but
it
must
be
exercised
in
such
way
that
it
does
not
follow
a
specific
prohibition
of
the
bill
of
rights.
no
matter
how
wise,
no
matter
how
effective
a
trial
without
jury,
or
double
jeopardy,
or
trial
without
counsel
would
be
in
preventing
crimes
speaks,
that
cannot
stand,
that
cannot
justify
a
specific
prohibition
in
the
constitution
in
the
bill
of
rights.
and,
in
fact,
in
cole
the
whole
base
of
the
decision
was
that
the
statute
clause
is
a
specific
prohibition,
the
first
prohibition
in
the
bill
of
rights
against
a
financing
of
the
operations
of
parochial
schools.
the
state
seems
to,
also
indeed
clearly
bases
its
position
on
this,
in
this
part
that
this
statute
is
limited
to
schools
in
low-income
areas.
again,
i
know
of
no
decision
of
any
court
holding
that
to
be
a
critical,
or
relevant
constitutional
question,
where
the
question
is
equal
protection.
if
the
state
chooses
a
certain
class
as
beneficiaries
of
its
action
and
excludes
other
classes
as
for
example,
if
the
state
provides
free
counsel
in
criminal
case
which
indeed
it
must,
to
poor
people
but
not
to
wealthy
people
or
provide
free
access
to
the
divorce
cases,
indeed
it
must
for
poor
people
not
to
wealthy
people
or
other
cases
it
does
not
provides
the
transcripts
of
criminal
trial
to
put
but
not
the
wealthy
people.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
indigents,
the
indigents.
if
the
state
--
then
quite
clearly
this
would
not
--
this
is
a
rational
classification
not
quite
like
the
equal
protection
but
the
state
could
constitutionally
provide
free
access
with
divorce
courts,
to
faculty
courts,
to
free
transcripts,
to
public
defense
service,
to
all,
to
the
indeed,
it
does
in
public
schools.
public
schools
are
open
to
everybody,
the
wealthiest
as
well
as
the
most
poor,
and
it
is
not
a
violation
of
equal
protection
because
of
the
reasonable
classification
whether,
if
the
state
chooses
one
alternative
free
for
all
or
the
other
type
of
free
only
for
the
poor,
the
indigent.
but
that
never
has
been
used
to
say
that
the
state
can
violate
an
express
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
where
individual
who
are
involved
where
they
cannot
violate
it,
where
the
(inaudible)
to
it.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
--
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
below
is
entirely
correct,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
for
the
state
to
provide
funds
for
the
maintenance
and
repair
of
schools
which
are
used
in
part
at
least
for
religious
education
or
religious
question.
the
only
case
which
can
remotely
justify
this
statute
and
very
remotely,
is
the
everson
case
in
which
the
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
paying,
reimbursing
parents
for
the
expenses
of
sending
their
children
on
public
bus
to
parochial
schools.
mr.
justice
black
for
majority
of
the
court
stated
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
protect
the
children
from
the
hazards
of
the
road.
well,
we
do
not
deny,
we
cannot
deny
because
the
of
prior
decision
of
this
court
which
seem
to
take
a
position
that
you
cannot
go
behind
what
the
legislative
state
in
its
declaration
of
purposes.
therefore
we
must
assume
that
the
purposes
of
this
statute
the
same,
but
the
effect
is
probably
different,
you
do
not
teach
religion
or
practice
religion
on
the
bus.
if
you
did,
if
a
private
owned
bus,
in
everson
it
was
a
publicly
owned
bus,
system
parents
got,
paid
back
for
the
money
which
they
paid
for
transportation
of
public
bus
but
if
you
did
under
mccollum
against
board
of
education,
going
way
back
to
1948
which
held
that
no
premises
publicly
owned,
publicly
financed
can
be
used
for
religious
teaching
or
religious
worship
even
for
as
much
as
a
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
a
week.
if
it
does
that,
it
is
unconstitutional,
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
mccollum
and
of
course
it
held
the
same
thing
in
engel
against
vitale,
the
prayer
case,
in
abington
township
involving
bible
reading
and
in
lemon
against
kurtzman.
so
we
believe
that
this
part
of
the
statute,
part
one,
was
quite
properly
held
unconstitutional
by
unanimous
vote
of
the
district
court.
part
two
deals
with
tuition
payments.
the
statute
provides
that
up
to
50
%
of
the
tuition
of
the
--
no,
i
believe
it
does
have
--
but
the
basic
provision
is
that
$50.00
is
paid
per
child
for
the
tuition
up
to
no
more
than
the
tuition
actually
is
--
for
the
tuition
paid
for
enrollment
in
nonpublic
schools.
the
question
of
tuition
grants
is
not
a
new
one,
unlike
the
maintenance
and
repair
and
tax
credits
which
are
quite
new
which
appear
to
be
a
recent.
tuition
grants
has
a
means
of
avoiding
constitutional
limitations
goes
back
at
least
a
century.
it
has
been
challenged
in
the
court
in
three
different
contexts.
first,
is
a
violation
of
state
constitutional
provisions
against
financing
parochial
schools.
second,
under
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
and
third
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
a
racial
segregation
context,
a
decision
growing
out
of
state
appropriations
of
public
funds
to
pay
for
the
tuition
of
pupils
in
racial
segregated
schools.
now,
my
own
research
and
i
am
not
volunteering
that
it
is
an
exhaustive,
indeed
as
i
have
indicated
a
moment,
i
did
overlooked
one
case
fortunately
which
would
support
to
my
position
not
oppose,
but
the
research
i
have
done
has
disclosed
not
a
single
decision
and
there
were
many,
many
which
considered
this
question,
not
a
single
decision
holding
that
there
was
a
constitutional
difference
between
a
direct
grant
of
public
funds
to
religious
schools
and
paying
whole
or
part
of
the
tuition
of
children
attending
those
schools.
the
cases
--
some
of
the
cases
there
are
many
others,
supporting
my
position
are
in
my
brief,
both
on
the
--
under
the
state
constitutions
establishment
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
the
(inaudible)
cases
decided
both
before
and
after
the
lemon,
dicenso
cases,
there
were
three,
i
point
out
three
in
my
brief,
there
is
actually
a
fourth
one,
i
must,
i
say
overlooked
things,
i
argued
the
case
but
it
slipped
my
memory.
there
were
four
cases
in
which
the
us
district
courts,
in
each
case
a
three-judge
court
passed
upon
the
question.
one
was
wolman
against
essex
in
ohio
which
this
court
affirmed
without
argument.
the
other
is
this
case,
the
third
is
the
case
which
will
be
argued
day
after
this
one,
lemon
against
kurtzman.
the
fourth
which
i
did
not
cite
in
my
brief
as
i
said
which
i
slipped
my
memory
is
lemon
against
sloan,
where
--
i
mean
it's
nebraska
against
missouri,
nebraska
against
missouri
where
district
court
in
missouri
was
faced
with
a
challenge
by
parents
of
children
in
parochial
schools
to
the
state
constitution
and
the
state
practice
of
excluding
parochial
schools
from
governmental
financing.
the
parents
claimed
that
this
is
a
violation
of
religious
freedom
and
equal
protection.
the
suit
was
started
before
the
decision
in
lemon
against
dicenso.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
may
i
just
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
i
think
you
are
right
--
technically
you
are
right
and
to
some
extent
this
is
what
the
state
of
new
york
contends,
as
distinguishes
them,
but
actually
it's
only
technically
right
because
chapter
414
is
a
single
package.
it
takes
care
of
children,
parents
of
children
with
incomes
under
$5,000
through
a
tuition
grant.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
takes
care
of
children,
or
parents
of
children
with
incomes
over
$5,000.00
through
a
tax
credit.
children
over
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
part
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
but
as
i
say
this
is
one
single
fact
and
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
part
two
if
it
were
--
if
it
could
be
severed
from
the
rest
is
applied
to
parents
of
children
with
incomes
not
more
than
$5,000.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
case
is
--
this
case
is
different
from
the
--
it
is
not
however
constitutionally
distinguishable.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
--
in
my
position.
so
the
reason
which
i
stated
in
respect
to
part
one.
that
too
limiting
itself
as
it
does
to
schools
in
low-income
areas
is
also
so
purposed
and
so
applied,
but
as
i
said
it's
our
position
--
it's
our
position
that
you
have
as
all
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
and
before
any
court
have
held
that
it
cannot
pay
the
tuition
for
persons
attending
nonpublic
schools
where
either
equal
protection
or
most
specifically
in
this
case,
an
express
prohibition
of
the
statute
is
involved,
the
fact
that
it
is
limited
to
one
particular
class
of
low-incomes
does
not
justify,
which
otherwise
would
be
an
express
prohibition
against
financing
of
religious
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
afdc
payments
or
payments
for
poor
children
and
the
families
which
are
used
by
those
families
for
their
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
specific
provision
of
their
tuition
to
that.
and
with
--
that
is
as
far
as
i
know,
i
believe
for
what
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
do
not
know
for
people
beyond
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
sure,
as
far
as
i
know
the
reason
there
is
no
such
provision
that
is
similar
to
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights
which
goes
to
everybody
--
if
it
were
--
if
there
were
specific
grant
in
there
and
i
am
fairly
confident
of
it,
a
specific
grant
there
for
tuition
to
schools
and
that
tuition
was
payable
to
schools
which
teach
and
practice
religion,
i
believe
will
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
in
the
first
place
this
indeed
is
pointed
out
in
the
various
briefs.
this
case,
this
question
and
the
question
set
–
posed
by
justice
stewart,
also
has
been
considered
in
many
of
the
cases
which
i've
referred
to,
considered
the
past.
in
respect
to
the
poverty
or
indigents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
very
case
the
majority
of
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
fact
that
this
is
--
this
money
goes
to
in
part
one,
goes
to
indigent
schools,
it
goes
in
indigent
or
in
low-income
areas,
is
almost
--
i
differentiate
this
from
the
tax
credits
for
unconstitutionality.
it
says
tax
credits
across
the
board
whereas
the
low-income
housing
--
low-income
schools
are
mostly
catholic
schools,
therefore
a
specific
religious
group
is
benefited
and
therefore
it's
unconstitutional
even
though
they
held
tax
credit
constitutional.
now,
in
respect
to
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
the
least.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
the
least,
i
am
just
pointing
to
the
court
below
is
using
this
argument
just
the
reversed
way.
i
am
not
--
i
am
saying
that
in
every
case,
in
every
case
which
came
to
the
court
to
this
court,
lemon,
dicenso
and
which
all
the
other
courts,
the
argument
has
always
been,
it
is
stated
in
the
declaration
purpose
that
was
out
this
money
from
the
government,
the
poor
people
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
an
education.
that's
the
basis
of
argument
every
case
and
as
court
has
deemed
it,
even
in
the
dicenso,
the
law
they
have
distinguished
between
indigent
and
non-indigent,
the
poor
and
non-poor
school,
it
provided
that
the
money
can
only
go
to
those
schools
where
the
cost,
the
salaries
paid
to
teachers
are
less
than
the
salaries
paid
in
public
schools,
that
is
poor
schools,
those
with
the
lower
payment
therefore
that
in
poor
schools
where
and
the
argument
--
the
argument
in
those
cases
was
that
without
this
money,
poor
people
would
not
be
able
to
go
to
private
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
might
very
well.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
except
on
private
and
if
you
go
to
colleges.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
indeed
i
believe
it
would,
i
believe
to
that
extend,
it
would.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
the
difference
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
necessarily,
because
this
answers
the
question
which
the
chief
justice
raised.
these
moneys
go
to
these
parents
and
it
become
as
their
funds.
they
have
a
certain
degree
of
flexibility
to
what
they
used
if
there
must.
it's
so
true
with
the
gi
bill,
in
the
form
of
law
one,
the
gi
did
not
get
gi
benefits
as
they
did
in
world
war
ii,
they
got
bonuses
and
they
used
that
bonus
for
a
lot
of
purpose.
some
of
them
even
gave
it
away
to
churches,
which
they
had
a
right
to
do
it?
it
was
their
money.
it
was
paid
to
them
in
compensation
for
the
services
of
which
they
rendered
to
its
income.
there
was
a
no
stings
attached.
now,
because
many
of
the
parent
--
of
the
soldiers
use
this
money
unwisely,
they
setup
businesses,
they
gave
it
away,
they
gambled
it
away.
in
world
war
ii,
it
decide
to
put
stings
attached
and
said
this,
the
rationale
of
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights.
we
have
taken
a
group
of
american
young
men
away
from
their
lives
and
we
have
put
them
into
the
army
to
serve
the
nation.
during
that
period,
their
more
fortunate
or
other
contemporaries
didn't
have
to
do
this
and
could
continue
their
education
in
order
to
make,
to
earn
a
livelihood,
they
can
go
to
college,
they
can
go
to
trade
school,
they
can
even
go
to
seminaries
to
become
clergy
man
and
make
a
living
that
way.
now
one
way
to
send
the
survivors
of
the
armed
forces
back,
they
had
lost
three,
or
four,
five
years
of
their
preparatory
years,
and
instead
of
giving
them
unrestricted
money
as
in
world
war
i,
because
of
the
unfortunate
experience
there,
we
don't
say
you
have
got
to
use
this
money,
to
give
you
some
possibility
of
making
up
and
earning
a
livelihood
and
there
ought
to
be
used
only
for
preparation
to
earn
a
livelihood
to
give
you
a
some
money
for
that
purpose,
and
you
might
even
argue,
it's
not
you
set
aside,
that
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
of
religious
liberty
if
the
states
--
if
the
government
said
any
livelihood
you
want
accepting
your
inclusion.
i
am
not
arguing
with
that
one
way
or
other,
it's
not
necessary,
but
that
was
--
that
was
the
g.i.
bill
looked
like.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
the
money
was
used
by
them
for
any
purpose,
it's
their
money.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
this
case
the
money
could
only
be
used
for
that
purpose,
unless
they
come
back,
unless
the
parent
comes
with
a
receipted
bills
from
a
private
school
and
as
my
--
the
record
shows,
the
brief
shows.
96
%
of
the
schools
in
new
york
which
are
private
are
religious
schools.
so,
a
full
part
of
purpose
that
means
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
certainly.
yes.
yes,
there
are
below
4
%
of
the
schools
and
i
don't
think
--
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
token
could
really
save
the
country.
it
didn't
lemon
against
--
it
did
in
the
lemon
case,
it
did
in
the
dicenso,
it
did
in
the
wolman
against
--
a
case
which
the
two
wolmans,
the
two
assets
cases
which
one
was
already
been
affirmed
without
opinion,
it
was
a
unanimous
case
and
all
those
cases,
no
case
that
i
know
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
the
money
went
for
tuition,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
constitutionally
distinct.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
it's
still
--
it's
still
a
money
for
tuition.
it
isn't
a
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
they
are
relevant
mostly
towards
the
third
point
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
this
court,
in
your
honor's
opinion
in
lemon
and
dicenso
that
and
in
walz
too,
your
honor's
opinion
in
walz,
that
these
statutes
are
all
directed
for
practically
one
religious
group,
and
i
am
just
relying
on
like
your
honor
said
in
those
cases.
none
of
them
(voice
overlap)
all
of
the
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
that's
why
your
honor
upheld
the
walz
decision
because
of
that
pointed
out
--
you
pointed
out
that
it
is
not
directed
to
one
religious
group
and
that's
how
you
run
and
distinguished.
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
in
respect
to
the
what
the
--
the
court
pointed
out
both
in
walz
and
lemon
and
dicenso,
the
division
of
the
community
on
religious
grounds
and
the
entanglement
involved
in
political
attempt
in
bringing
in
this
issue
in
political
areas
and
this
was
one
of
the
things
which
this
court
have
attended
to
prohibit
and
it
is
relevant
in
waltz
towards
constitutionality
was
relevant
in
lemon
and
dicenso
towards
unconstitutionality.
now
i
suggest
it
is
relevant
here
towards
unconstitutionality
as
well
and
this
is
not
created
by
me
out
of
thin
air.
it
was
brought
in
by
two
decisions.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
there
was
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
yes.
i
just
add
that
i
believe
that
even
if
they
were
all
religious
--
it's
all
religious
affair
because
i
think
the
court
and
this
court
in
everson
and
mccollum
in
the
(inaudible)
cases
and
torcaso
against
watkins
forbade
aiding
one
religion
or
all
religions,
and
it
make
no
distinction,
and
i
think
will
be
unconstitutional
whether
it
is
one
religion
or
all
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
answer
i
say
your
honor,
is
that
this
was
not
even
restricted
to
religion.
this
was
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
indeed.
one
of
my
--
just
as
the
bus
transportation
went
to
religious
and
nonreligious
schools,
but
indeed
that's
true
but
there
was
no
money
paid
for
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
no
--
there
is
not
here
in
a
sense
that
it
is
not
paid
directly
but
there
is
here
in
the
sense
that
the
money
is
paid
only
if
you
pay
tuition
in
the
religious
schools,
if
only
if
you
pay
tuition
in
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
private
school.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
private
schools.
96
%
of
which
are
religious
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
it
did.
it
didn't
originally
but
it
did
go
through
the
hands
of
the
recipients
after
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
was
changed
after
the
--
the
question
was
brought
before
congress,
and
they
realized
that
there
was
a
constitutional
problem
thereafter
the
change
of
law,
that
the
tuition
money
went
directly
to
the
g.i.
not
to
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
the
g.i.
became
but
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
he
could
use
the
tuition
anywhere
he
wanted.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
only
for
tuition,
they
could
use
it
only
for
tuition,
but
for
tuition
in
any
college,
a
public
college
or
private.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
right,
he
can
use
it
for
any
college
but
in
respect
to
tuition
limited
specifically,
limited
specifically
except
for
4
%;
for
4
%
which
i
believe
it
is
token
and
put
in
i
don't
believe
it
could
purify
the
other
non
uses,
limited
specifically
to
religious
schools
in
96
%
of
the
cases,
i
do
not
believe
that
could
be
upheld
under
any
law.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
they
have
done
inspection,
those
standards
involved
surveillance
of
the
schools
in
the
sense
which
lemon
and
dicenso
i
believe
it
could
not
be
upheld
under
lemon
and
dicenso.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
that
was
that
the
court
pointed
that
out
in
lemon
and
dicenso.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
because,
it's
not
found
objectionable
but
when
it
becomes
two,
the
use
of
religious
funds,
the
court
found
it
objectionable
in
lemon
and
dicenso.
the
court
said
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
not
constitutionally
objectionable
but
on
the
other
hand,
that
fact
does
not
at
least
unless
this
court
overrules
lemon
and
dicenso,
that
fact
was
not
found
to
immunize
that
use
of
public
funds
for
religious,
for
schools
which
could
teach
religion
and
secular
subjects,
that's
what
the
court
held
in
lemon
and
dicenso
and
the
court,
indeed
as
recently
as
last
year
and
not
in
wisconsin
against
yoder.
this
court
repeated
that
statement,
the
court
repeated
it
and
i
should
like
to
just
quote
what
the
court
said,
as
it
recently
as
last
year
in
wisconsin
against
yoder,
found
page
14
of
my
brief.
long
before
there
was
general
acknowledgment
of
need
for
universal
formal
education,
the
religion
quotes
specifically
firmly
fix
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
religious
beliefs,
but
trusting
this
fund
more
right
was
unequally
framed,
even
if
equally
framed,
even
if
that's
explicit,
prohibition
against
the
statute
venue
religion
by
government.
the
values
underlying
these
two
provisions
were
linked
to
religion,
have
been
jealously
protect
sometimes
even
at
the
expense
of
other
interest
of
admissibly
high
social
importance.
the
invalidation
of
financial
aid
to
parochial
schools
by
government
grants
for
(inaudible)
is
but
in
this
regard
is
one
example
of
the
extent
to
which
the
courts
have
disregarded,
notwithstanding
that
such
aid
programs
were
legislatively
determined
to
be
in
public
interest
and
it
serves
the
sound
education
policy
by
state
and
congress,
citing
the
lemon
against
kurtzman,
tilton
against
richardson
and
everson
v.
board
of
education,
then
the
fact
of
those
cases
are
no
difference
than
the
facts
in
this
case
as
i
--
and
is
no
different
in
any
of
the
cases
the
four
district
court
cases
including
the
one
which
nebraska
against
missouri
which
i
have
not
cited.
all
those
cases,
there
were
12
judges,
four
from
the
court
of
appeals,
eight
from
the
district
court
deciding
on
tuition
grant,
not
one,
not
one
of
those
judges
now
held
that
tuition
grants
is
constitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
332
federal
sub
275,
405
us
1050
from
last
year.
1972.
now,
let
me
read
something.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
405
us
1050.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
97
--
then
let
me
say
what
a
moment
what
the
court
held
in
the
nebraska
case.
this
was
the
dicenso,
lemon
case
was
decided
after
the
suit
was
started,
and
the
court
in
that
respect
says,
“faced
with
this
decision,
the
plaintiffs
now
argue
that
some
alternative
program
such
as
tuition
grants
could
constitutionally
divide
which
--
that
so
they
can
self-content
which
be
free
of
government
entanglement.
the
court
rejected
that
and
said
--
and
i
don't
want
to
return
to
that
--
it
said
lemon
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
it
is
--
this
is
--
well
it's
somewhere
between
dictum
and
holding
but
the
court
said
that,
the
court
said
that
this
would
be
unconstitutional
too
under
the
lemon
and
we
breached
them,
wholly
apart
from
the
fact
that
entanglement
comparable
to
that
described
in
lemon
cannot
be
realistically
be
avoided;
if
plaintiffs
have
granted
aid
for
parochial
school
purposes,
particularly
on
a
continuing
basis.
it's
self
evident
both
the
purpose
and
affect
of
any
statute
from
tax
rate
funds
to
assist
parents,
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
would
necessarily
features
a
court
religion.
so
that
we
have
12
federal
court
judges,
not
one
of
them
finding
any
distinction
and
no
state
quotes
of
south
and
north,
both
in
this
context
and
the
equal
protection
racial
segregation,
not
one
of
them
finding
any
distinction
between
a
direct
grant
and
tuition.
now
i
must
devote
the
rest
of
my
time
unfortunately,
i
have
not
been
able
to
go
to
it,
but
i
must
speak
about
the
third,
the
tax
credit
part
which
indeed
the
most
important
because
that
seems
to
be
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing.
now,
i
concede,
if
tuition
grants
are
held
by
this
court
to
be
constitutionally
permissible
then
tax
credits
are
constitutionally
permissible.
that
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i
think
the
reverse
of
that
is
true.
i
think
the
reverse
of
that,
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
because
tax
credits
is
merely
one-fourth
of
paying
for
tuition.
now,
we're
not
speaking
about
tax
deductions,
we're
not
speaking
--
that's
not
before
this
court
although
--
we're
not
taking
about
tax
exemptions,
we're
not
speaking
tax
exemptions
nor
tax
deductions.
suppose
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
between
exemptions
or
between
deduction?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
might,
the
district
court
--
in
the
case
which
was
decided
after
this,
which
is
not
found
tax
exemption.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
just
want
to
answer
--
complete
my
answer
then
i
will
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
the
district
court
in
ohio
case
cited
in
brief
katya
(ph)
case
and
professor
froing
(ph)
among
others
are
the
opinion
that
there
is
no
difference
between
tax
credits
and
tax
deductions,
that
their
equally
unconstitutional.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
a
fairly
good
case
could
be
made
of
the
constitutionality
of
tax
deductions
for
tuition
paid
to
parochial
schools.
i
think
there
is
a
wall
of
a
difference
between
credits
and
deductions.
for
reasons
which
i
don't
want
to
--
which
i
state
in
my
brief
and
which
is
stated
by
the
court
below,
judge
garfield
(ph)
in
his
opinion,
stated
the
reasons
why
there
is
a
difference
between
tax
deductions,
tax
credits,
but
i
think
i
could
--
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
that
if
a
payment
for
tuition
to
parochial
school
what
treated
as
a
contribution
to
the
parochial
school,
in
other
words
it
would
be
deductible
to
that
amount
to
no
more
and
treat
like
the
contributions
to
a
church
which
are
tax
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
or
medical
deduction
itself.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
anything,
if
it
were
treated
as
a
deduction
then
i
think
that
it
could
--
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
for
its,
that
is
constitutional.
i
know
that's
a
poor
point
to
disagree
with
me
and
i
of
course,
respect
his
(inaudible)
of
constitutional
law
but
i
believe
it
can
be
made
but
where
the,
as
in
the
statute,
he
is
simply
reduced
the
tax
liability
by
a
certain
amount
and
instead
of
paying
the
government
like
you
owe
it,
you'd
reduce
an
amount
which
is
set
forth,
which
determined
by
the
statute
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
much
you
deduct,
how
much
your
tuition
is,
it
will
depend
upon
your
income
status
and
it's
--
i
can
see
no
difference
between
a
situation
where
you
owe
the
government
'x'
dollars
for
your
taxes
and
you
pay
the
government
that
amount.
the
government
sends
you
an
independent
check
for
your
tuition
which
you
owed,
which
you
have
paid
to
a
parochial
school.
i
see
no
constitutions
different
between
that
situation,
and
a
situation
where
instead
of
paying
the
government
of
what
you
owe
them
on
your
income
tax,
you'll
send
them
a
state
a
receipted
bill
for
your
tuition
and
you
deduct
that
amount
to
may
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
if
you
don't
have
and
you
get
under
the
new
---
they
will
give
you
the
money
in
the
form
of
tuition.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
under
a
statute.
so
you'll
get
the
money
from
a
state
loan
of
your
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
doesn't
do
them
any
good
because
i
--
and
therefore
in
this
state
--
in
this
statute,
they
give
you
the
cash
in
the
form
for
tuition.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
ohio
and
in
some
other
states,
they
give
you
a
negative
income
tax
rate.
they
pay
as
a
money
but
you
don't
pay
it.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
it
may
even
give
a
rise
to
a
question
on
establishment
clause
as
well.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
or
even
more
than
free
exercise
--
free
exercise
and
establishment
because
establishment
clauses
as
it
is
defined
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
equally
forbids
aid
to
religion
and
aid
to
anti-religion.
the
classic
expression
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh!
i
think
it
is
a
(inaudible)
school.
if
it
is
a
secular
school
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh!
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood,
i
thought
you
said
a
school.
no,
if
it's
a
purely
secular
school,
then
it's
a
public
school,
because
that's
what's
this
court
held
under
mccollum
and
engle
against
vitale
and
the
schempp
case.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
don't
see,
how
it's
–
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court
has
all
decided
on
the
nebraska
case,
the
nebraska
case,
that
was
the
argument
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
nebraska
case,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
because
nebraska,
the
case
which
i
cited
this
morning,
respect
to
a
suit
brought
by
parents
of
children
attending
private
schools
parochial
schools,
who
claimed
there
was
a
violation
of
free
exercise
because
the
private
schools
were
excluded/
the
district
court
unanimously
rejected
that
this
court
affirmed
without
any
dissent.
there
is
no,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
there
is
no
violation
of
equal
protection
in
the
classification
which
the
first
amendment
compels.
that's
what
this
court
held,
the
first
commendment
compels,
this
court
said
in
lemon,
dicenso,
compels
non
support
in
whole
or
in
part
of
parochial
schools.
so
if
the
first
amendment
compels
it
and
the
state
complied
with
it,
obviously
it's
not
following
the
action.
well,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
primarily
to,
but
i
wasn't
able
to
do
it,
this
morning,
the
tax
credit
provision.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
a
tax
credit
statute.
mrs.
coon
has
conceded
that
that's
not
tax
deduction
stuff.
the
court
below
called
it
a
tax
credit.
now
it
is
not
tax
deduction
statute
for
obvious
reasons.
in
the
tax
deduction,
you
deduct
from
a
gross
income
the
amount
you
have
contributed,
that's
what
you
do
when,
if
you
make
a
contribution
to
a
hospital,
to
an
art
museum,
to
a
church.
he
do
not
deduct.
the
state
figures
out
for
you
and
in
our
brief
and
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
all
the
parties
and
their
briefs,
the
state
figured
out,
on
page
six
of
my
brief,
the
amount
you
will
get,
benefit
you
will
get
by
the
deductions
and
it's
clear
that
the
benefits
stopped
where
the
tuition
grant
stops,
$50.00
per
child.
now
if
you
make,
i
will
make
a
contribution
of
$1000.00
to
a
church,
to
an
art
museum,
i
deduct
from
my
gross
income
$1000.00
and
then
my
income
tax
is
determined
on
the
balance.
if
i
pay
tuition
of
let’s
say
$50.00
for
each
child,
then
that
--
i
don't
deduct
$50.00
from
my
gross
income,
i
deduct
up
to
$1000.00
a
child,
up
to
$3000.00
from
my
gross
income,
why?
in
order
to
get
the
$50.00
which
will
be
allowed
to
me
per
child.
now
the
state
has
done
that
itself.
this
is
the
analysis
given
by
state
legislature.
it
is
simply
using
the
device
of
the
tax
system
to
achieve
a
payment
to
the
parents
of
children
in
pubic
schools.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
do
it
in
several
ways.
first,
a
deduction
is
one
which
is
uniform
to
all,
in
respect
to
all
contributions.
there
is
no
difference
between
a
grant,
how
much
you
contribute
to
an
art
museum,
to
a
scientific
institution,
to
the
fpca
on
a
market
deduct
to
contribute
to
parochial
schools.
here
is
the
reason;
if
you
contribute
$50.00
to
the
art
museums,
you
deduct
$50.00
from
your
taxable
income.
here,
if
you
pay
$50.00,
you
don't
deduct
$50.00
from
taxable
income,
you
deduct
$1000.00.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say
that
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
in
this
context
yes.
in
this
context,
this
is
a
tax
credit.
it
would
be
a
tax
credit
if
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
is
a
broader
definition,
yes
indeed
and
indeed
mrs.
coon
did
conceded
that.
she
said
this
is
not
a
tax
deduction.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
deem
that
unconstitutional.
i
would
deem
that
unconstitutional
because
that
is
an
obvious
preference
of
aid
within
the
class
of
tax
credits.
in
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said,
i
believe
that's
unconstitutional
because
this
constitutes
a
benefit
exclusively
limited
to
those
who
send
their
children
to
parochial
schools.
it
would
be
both
equal
protection
and
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
any
event
what
this
--
what
this
title
implies,
it
recognized,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
not
a
tax
deduction
because
it
allows
you
this
money
even
if
you
deduct,
if
you
have
deductions
or
even
if
you
take
a
standardized
deduction,
you
don't
itemize.
you
have
already
got
the
benefit
of
deduction
and
whatever
it
is,
10%
or
whatever
it
is.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
you
still
get
this,
you
still
get
this
amount
even
if
you
have
already,
you
have
gotten
the
benefit.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
only
thing
i
can
answer
to
that
is
that
this
means
elevating
the
form
of
both
the
substances,
maybe
pretense
and
it
was
clear
because
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
tax
credit
and
as
all
the
--
my
opponent
say,
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
a
recognition
of
the
serious
finance
conditions
of
a
private
schools
and
the
non-private
education
and
put
one
statute,
all
these
things.
if
the
whole
purpose
of
this
is
to
get
money
into
the
private
school,
else,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
fails,
else
the
provisions
regarding
the
impacted
aids
have
no
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh!
no
because
no
tax
deduction
applies
equally
to
every
type
of
beneficiary
and
the
court
answer
that
in
walz
that
where
you
have
a
uniform
gift,
a
uniform
treatment
of
all
non-profit
organizations,
museums
and
so
on,
then
avoid
entanglement.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
that
tuition
--
services
rendered,
in
all
instances.
if
it
was
deductible
as
a
deduction,
in
other
words
the
amount
you
paid
is
deducted.
well,
i
think,
if
it's
deducted
from
your
gross
income,
i
think,
as
i
have
indicated
before
it
maybe
constitutional.
if
we
deduct
it
from
what
you
provided,
i
think
it
will
be
unconstitutional
and
that's
what
this,
what
has
it
done
here.
you
are
deducting
the
amount
in
tuition.
you
are
deducting
an
amount
which
the
state
figured
out
will
give
you
back
your
tuition,
$1000.00
per
child,
you
pay
tuition
$50.00.
you
will
get
a
deduction
of
$1000.00
up
to
$3000.00,
nor
to
--
nor
that
you
can
get
your
tax
liability
reduced
$50.00,
even
if
you’ve
already
gotten
a
deduction,
a
permnanet
or
standby
deduction.
and
the
state
says,
the
statute
says,
you
have
got
to
make
your
choice.
if
you
want
to
get
this
money,
you
have
two
ways.
you
can
get
through
a
benefit
of
this
or
you
can
get
through
a
benefit
of
the
tuition
grant
section.
they’re
both
the
same
purpose.
you
take
a
choice
here,
when
we
are
giving
you
$50.00
back,
one
way
or
the
other.
you
can
take
it
through
a
tuition
grant,
if
you
are
assuming
you’re
under
5000.
you
can
take
it
through
tuition
grant,
you
can
take
it
through
this,
but
obviously
the
purpose
in
both
cases
is
the
same.
now,
i
just
want
to
make
one
point
about
the
--
what
mr.
haggerty
said
about
the
fact
that
the
money
can't
be
used
in
respect
to
the
maintenance
and
repair
cannot
be
used
to
repair
the
heating
system
as
far
as
the
chapel
is
concerned
and
so
on.
assuming
that
is
so,
it
isn't
or
assuming
that
so,
that
thing
you
are
back
into
the
problem
of
entanglement.
that
propels
the
state
into
checking
how
your
money
is
used
and
an
average,
it's
not
enough
because
in
tilton,
only
50%
was
government
funds,
50%
was
government
funds,
the
other
50%
came
from
the
college
yet
the
supreme
court
said,
that
you
cannot
use
those
premises
for
religious
purposes
even
after
20
years,
even
for
one
lecture
in
religion,
even
for
one
mass
set.
after
20
years,
even
though
the
government
pays
only
half,
so
the
federal
government
pays
only
half
here,
does
not
remove
the
constitutional
thing.
the
government
cannot,
in
the
first
amendment,
pay
in
whole
or
in
part
for
the
maintenance
of
institutions
which
teach
or
practice
religion.
the
court
said
long
before
--
the
court
said
that
in
mccollum
against
maryland
where
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
school,
for
a
half
hour
to
an
hour
a
week
was
used
for
religious
education.
thank
you.
