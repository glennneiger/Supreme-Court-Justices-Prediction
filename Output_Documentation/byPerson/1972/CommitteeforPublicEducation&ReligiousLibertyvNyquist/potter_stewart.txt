justice

stewart
to
poor
people
as
to
indigents.
justice
potter
stewart
those
cases
at
least
--
the
ones
i
am
familiar
with,
that
is
the
ohio
case
and
the
pennsylvania
case
to
be
argued
following
this
group
of
cases,
those
have
provided
various
assistance
across
the
board
to
parents
whose
children
to
go
to
the
nonpublic
schools,
this
one
is
directed
to
impoverish
families,
isn't
it
right?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
part
three.
i
remember
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
talking
now
about
part
two?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
another
question
in
this
case
whether
or
not
it's
severable,
which
you
haven't
come
to
that
yet
either.
i
am
just
directing
myself
to
part
two.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
different
from
the
other
three
that
you
cited
to
us,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
categorical
assistance
programs,
mr.
pfeffer?
i
am
thinking
about
afdc,
cooperatively
financed
by
the
state
and
federal
governments.
the
amount
of
the
grant
to
the
family
with
dependent
children
depends
upon
the
--
generally
upon
the
number
of
children.
and,
what
provision
if
any
is
made
for
children
in
afdc
families
that
go
to
nonpublic
schools,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
i
basically
know
what
the
program
is,
i
asked
you
whether
it
is
made
for
children
who
go
to
parochial
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
need
either
and
that's
reason,
i
was
asking
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
how
justification
of
the
welfare
progress,
particularly
the
categorical
assistance
program
for
the
afdc
for
dependent
children
and
fatherless
families,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we
had
a
case
here,
well
it
is
schwab
against
lynx
and
i
also
have
the
captions
wrong
saying
that
the
state
couldn't
cut
off
aid
to
a
child
who
is
attending
a
--
in
his
petition
of
higher
learning.
no
do
you
suppose
that
case
would
have
gone
differently
if
that
institution
had
been
a
parochial
institution?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
assume
it's
a
high
school.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
the
welfare
--
justice
potter
stewart
welfare
--
so
funds
have
to
be
set
--
cut
down
insofar
as
the
children
on
welfare
and
family
could
go
to
parochial
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
rationale,
but
how
the
hell
in
the
world
does
that
affect
your
first
amendment
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
fact
it
was
used
for
many
of
them
to
go
to
religious
institutions
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don't
understand
that
what
--
that
a
majority
are
roman
catholic
or
that
a
majority
are
religious
because
of
course
in
walz,
they
were
all
religious
by
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
case
was
about.
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
conceive
the
constitutionality
of
the
payments
made
under
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights
after
world
war
ii?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
all
that
money
went
to
aid
religious
institutions,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't
pay
to
the
school
nor
as
they
here?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
pay
tuition
in
private
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
nonpublic
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
or
medical
deductions
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
service
three
in
a
catholic
hospital.
justice
potter
stewart
the
credit
is
different.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
just
to
forgiveness
of
what
you
owe
the
government
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
a
set
off.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
like
paying
you
money
directly.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
isn't.
if
you
pay
a
$300
a
tuition,
under
the
new
york
plan,
you
don't
get
a
$300
deduction
from
your
income.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
you
do
not.
so
it's
not
a
deduction
as
that
term
of
this
is
generally
understood
in
tax
law,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
tax
credit,
is
just
the
reduction
of
the
amount
of
money
you
owe
the
government
directly,
that's
what
a
credit
is.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that
--
the
exemption
comes
out
of
--
it
serves
to
reduce
your
taxable
income
and
that
extend
is
like
a
deduction.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
a
gear
to
operate
to
actually
reduce
your
taxes
directly.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
you'll
expand
this
as
justice
rehnquist
had
suggested
in
the
earlier
question.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
a
true
credit.
justice
potter
stewart
a
forgiveness
of
part
of
what
you
owe
in
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
the
same
theory
about
it,
be
as
income
$5,000
or
$500.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
very
appropriate
day
to
be
discussing
this?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
query
in
these
papers,
a
tax
form
that
shows
us
how
this
works?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
eligible
for
the
tuition
relief
only
if
your
income
is
below
$5000.00,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
as
justice
rehnquist
said,
it
might
be
a
perfectly
valid
exercise
that
the
state’s
reserve
power
or
their
police
power,
that
power
companiously
known
as
the
police
power.
so
far
as
the
due
process
clause
goes
or
something
like
that
but
that
doesn't
--
that
begs
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
first
amendment,
doesn’t
it,
first
and
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
coon,
does
--
under
the
new
york
system
of
government,
does
there
have
to
be
an
appropriation
for
this
periodically
or
once
the
law
is
enacted,
does
it
just
automatically
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
bi-annually?
justice
potter
stewart
or
annually?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
this
law
isn't
self
executing
from
the
point
of
view,
it
is
financing?
justice
potter
stewart
an
annual
appropriation
for
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be,
as
a
matter
of
this
fact,
that
would
be
largely
the
puerto
rican
community,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
comes
to
about
280
schools
out
of
a
total
of
around
2,000?
justice
potter
stewart
almost
under
15%.
justice
potter
stewart
to
poor
people
as
to
indigents.
justice
potter
stewart
those
cases
at

how
about
the

mr.

i
