ms.
jean
m.
coon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
question
of
perspective
here,
we
think
that
the
validity,
constitutional
validity
of
the
statute
here
at
issue,
revolves
not
solely
around
the
precise
language
of
the
statute,
but
the
intent
and
purpose
with
which
the
new
york
state
legislature
enact
them.
the
legislature
in
1972
undertook
to
meet
certain
specific
needs
of
children
attending
non-public
schools
and
their
parents.
it
was
confronted
with
a
growing
clamor
for
tax
relief
on
the
part
of
parents
who
paid
tuition
in
the
non-public
schools
on
behalf
of
their
children
and
who
also
additionally
support
public
schools
in
the
form
of
tax
payments,
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
increasing
safety
hazards
in
non-public
schools
which
particularly
in
low
income
areas,
have
been
unable
to
meet
the
cost
of
maintenance
and
repair
essential
to
health
and
safe
structures.
further,
the
state
had
become
increasingly
cognizant
of
the
problem
faced
by
low
income
parents
in
paying
the
tuition
necessary
to
the
selection
of
a
non-public
school
education
for
their
children.
and
finally
and
while
not
directly
relevant
to
this
appeal
and
still
part
of
the
same
legislative
enactment,
in
those
areas
where
the
financial
crisis
in
the
non-public
schools
had
forced
their
closing,
the
public
schools
had
been
faced
with
increased
cost
of
education
in
general
and
particularly
in
the
cost
of
additional
physical
space
for
the
increasing
enrollments.
consequently,
in
an
attempt
to
meet
or
impart
to
alleviate
what
the
district
court
here
indeed
recognized
were
basically
secular
problems.
the
legislature,
the
state
of
new
york
adopted
chapter
414
of
the
laws
of
1972.
now,
i
will
address
myself
initially
in
this
argument
to
the
problem
with
which
mr.
pfeffer
left
off
that
of
the
income
tax
portion
of
the
legislation,
then
to
health
and
safety
grants
and
finally
to
that
portion
of
the
statute
relating
to
the
tuition
reimbursement
to
low
income
parents.
the
tax
portion
of
the
statute
provides
not
for
a
tax
credit
but
for
a
modification
of
adjusted
gross
income
for
the
purposes
of
new
york
determining
the
new
york
state
income
tax
payable.
for
new
york
state
income
tax
purposes,
the
adjusted
gross
income
is
the
same
on
both
the
federal
and
state
returns
with
the
exception
of
a
number
of
state
modifications.
there
are
additional
modifications
of
gross
income
which
are
provided
solely
in
state
law
and
not
under
the
federal
tax
returns.
for
example,
a
deduction
is
not
allowed
on
the
state
return
for
income
tax,
state
income
taxes
which
have
been
paid,
although,
it
is
allowed
on
the
federal
return
and
on
the
state
return
an
additional
modification
is
allowed
for
life
insurance
premiums
paid
although
they
are
not
allowed
on
the
federal
return.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
there
is.
it's
--
i
think
it
was
this
year.
well,
it
had
been
$150,
it's
now
less
than
that.
this
court
has
indeed
recognized
that
the
states
have
an
inherent
power
and
authority
in
enacting
tax
legislation.
the
powers
of
the
state
to
tax
its
citizens
are
coequal
with
those
of
the
federal
government
and
are
only
limited
by
this
specific
limitations
on
the
state's
power
found
in
the
federal
constitution.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
you
honor,
i
am.
we
think
it
is
particularly
significant
here
that,
in
the
cases
involving
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
income
tax
law,
this
court
upheld
the
validity
in
the
face
of
arguments
that
there
were
differences
in
the
classes
of
income
tax
deductions
or
exemptions
that
were
allowed,
that
they
were
not
uniform
as
to
all
tax
payers
and
then
some
could
claim
ones
which
others
could
not.
we
submit
that
the
new
york
legislature
in
selecting
and
enacting
a
tax
legislation
has
the
power
to
select
what
income
to
tax,
how
much
of
the
income
it
wishes
to
tax,
and
to
provide
for
deductions
and
exemptions
in
whatever
amount
and
for
whatever
purpose
it
elects.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
a
credit
is
--
a
tax
credit
is
different.
yes.
a
tax
credit
comes
off
with
the
tail
end.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
now
in
this
particular
instance,
this
comes
off
at
the
top.
this
is
a
modification
of
income
for
the
--
prior
to
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
tax
owed.
it
comes
off
at
the
beginning
of
the
tax
return.
it's
a
reduction
of
your
income
subject
to
tax.
we
submit
that
this
is
equivalent
to
in
legal
principle
to
a
deduction
or
to
an
exemption
because
it
is
a
thing
which
reduces
your
income
which
is
subject
to
tax
not
a
forgiveness
of
tax
owed.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
you
do
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it
is
not,
but
it
also
is
not
a
tax
credit
as
that
term
is
generally
understood
because
the
tax
credit
also
amounts
to
a
precise
dollar
amount.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
what
a
credit
is
and
this
is
not,
this
is
--
we
submit
equivalent
legal
principle
to
a
deduction
or
exemption
even
though
in
terms
of
the
actual
mechanism
by
which
it
operates,
it
doesn't
come
out
the
same
way.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
it
is
closest
to
analogy
because
your
exemption
is
not
related
to
an
actual
expenditure.
it's
a
fixed
amount.
so
it's
closest
to
an
exemption.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
and
to
that
extent,
this
is
precisely
the
same
way
that
this
does
reduce
your
taxable
income.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
no.
comes
off
the
top.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
new
york
state
has
actually
had
a
history
of
tax
credits
which
have
not
been
related
to
specific
purposes.
there
have
been
a
tax
credit
to
single
or
married
people
which
is
directed
at
reducing
in
tax
owed.
for
example,
for
a
single
person
1254,
a
married
couple
$25
reduction
and
up
until
this
past
year,
we
have
taken
off
as
a
tax
credit
of
the
income
tax
after
it's
been
computed.
this
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
a
true
credit.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
now,
this
on
the
other
hand,
the
modification
of
gross
income,
starts
at
the
top
of
the
income
tax
return
and
this
comes
off
before
you
compute
your
tax
liability,
comes
off
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
except
there
is
--
it's
figure
is
slightly
differently
since
it's
figured
differently
in
amounts
but
it
comes
off
at
that
part
of
the
tax
return,
it
comes
off
in
that
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it
varies
based
upon
income.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
persons
with
an
income
of
less
than
$9,000
or
less,
it's
a
thousand
dollars,
if
your
income
is
between
--
i
think
it's
20,000
and
23,999,
it's
a
$100
and
above
that
it's
a
zero
amount.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
so
that
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
would
be
up
at
that
point,
it's
up
--
in
that
point
of
part
of
the
return,
before
you
start
computing
your
taxable
income
and
tax
liability.
and
to
that
extent,
we
say
that
it
operates
much
the
same
as
the
deduction
or
exemption
and
probably
much
closer
to
an
exemption
simply
because
the
exemptions
themselves
are
set
as
fixed
amounts
which
unrelated
to
the
purpose
for
which
it's
granted.
in
other
words,
exempt,
present
exemption
of
the
federal
income
tax
is
$750.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
but
it's
also
unrelated,
it's
unrelated
to
the
actual
expenses
necessary
to
live
for
the
beneficiary
for
the
dependent
for
whom
it's
claimed.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
[laughter]
although
actually
in
new
york
state
we
are
entitled
for
an
additional
day
because
the
internal
revenue
district
office
in
massachusetts
has
a
legal
holiday
today.
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
an
exemption
also
varies
--
can
be
claimed
additionally,
there
are
additional
purposes
with
exemption
for
persons
over
65
going
and
so
forth.
so
the
exemptions
do
multiply
in
to
some
degree,
not
directly
related
to
the
number
of
persons
involved.
but
to
that
extent
because
it
is
also
not
directly
involved
in
the
question
of
the
actual
amount
spent,
we
say
that
this
is
closer
to
an
exemption
than
to
a
deduction,
but
is
a
legal
principle
equivalent
to
either
a
deduction
or
exemption
rather
than
a
tax
credit
because
it
relates
to
the
modification
of
taxable
income
prior
to
the
computation
of
the
tax
due.
we
submit
that
the
addition
of
a
modification
of
gross
income,
allowable
to
a
tuition
paying
parents
of
children
in
non
public
schools
was
no
more
and
no
less
than
exercise
of
the
state’s
inherent
power
to
determine
the
measure
of
personal
income
subject
to
taxation
by
the
state.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
i
should
also
point
out
that
in
the
medical
deductions,
for
example
from
the
federal
income
tax,
there
is
a
difference
there
really
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
claim
them
depending
upon
your
income.
the
higher
your
income,
it
is
the
less
likely
you
are
not
ever
going
to
get
a
medical
deduction
off
a
federal
income
tax.
this
initial
portion
of
the
statute,
we
submit
is
not
only
simply
an
exercise
of
the
state’s
power
of
taxation,
but
also
meets
the
secular
purpose
and
effects
which
were
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
schempp
case.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
and
as
was
specifically
found
by
the
district
court
was
to
provide
tax
relief
to
tuition
paying
parents
of
children
in
non
public
schools.
it
was
not
to
provide
aid
to
the
schools
themselves.
the
primary
effect
also
is
found
by
the
district
court
would
not
be
a
benefit
to
the
non
public
schools,
but
rather
to
the
tuition
paying
parent.
the
court
recognized
the
fact
that
by
the
time
the
parent’s
income
tax
liability
is
fixed
and
determined,
and
when
he
files
his
returns,
his
tuition
has
long
since
been
paid
and
that
any
benefit
he
gets
out
of
this
reduction
and
the
eventual
reduction
of
the
tax
which
would
be
most
likely
pocketed
by
him
and
used
for
his
own
personal
purposes
rather
than
turned
over
to
the
school.
that
it
is
in-chronologically
unrelated
to
the
time
of
paying
tuition
and
would
therefore
not
be
considered
to
be
using
the
parent
here
as
a
conduit
to
paying
money
to
the
schools.
without
payment
to
the
schools
or
any
contact
with
the
schools
attended
by
the
parent,
incidentally
on
the
new
york
state
income
tax
return
in
claiming
the
modification
of
gross
income,
a
parent
is
not
required
to
state
what
school
he
sent
the
child
to.
he
simply
adds
it
in
as
an
item
off
of
his
return
and
only
if
he
has
subsequently
audited,
would
there
be
any
question
raised
would
he
ever
have
to
prove
to
what
school
the
money
was
paid.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
i
can
get
you
one.
we
have
some
of
it
for
you.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
okay.
i
know
i
have
some
of
those.
all
right,
without
payment
to
the
schools
or
with
any
contact
with
the
schools
attended
by
the
children,
we
submit
that
there
can
be
no
entanglement
between
governor,
religion,
let
alone
excessive
entanglement.
the
provision
of
tax
relief
to
parents
can
in
no
way
be
construed
as
an
unconstitutional
aid
to
religion.
there
is
here
no
first
amendment
violation
in
the
district
court’s
judgment
and
that
should
be
affirmed.
as
to
section
1
of
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
only
if
his
income
is
less
than
$5000.00,
then
he
would
have
to
make
the
choice.
the
purpose
of
that
of
course
is
simply
to
see
they
do
not
get
a
double
benefit.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
true.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
i
assume
that
would
be
true.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
it's
over
--
if
your
income
is
over
$24,000.00
a
year,
you
cannot
take
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
you
cannot
take
the
tax
relief
and
if
your
income
is
over
$5000.00,
you
cannot
take
the
tuition
reimbursement.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
assume
that
that
would
be
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
think
so
because
there
would
be
no.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
it
does,
goes
progressively
down.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
and
apparently
it's
assumed
that
if
your
income
is
over
$24000.00
you
can
afford
to
send
your
children
to
non-public
schools
without
needing
any
tax
relief.
i
am
sure
their
parents
would
disagree
with
that
but
that
was
a
legislative
philosophy
behind
it.
getting
to
section
1
of
the
statute,
the
so-called
health
and
safety
grants,
the
legislature
specifically
found
that
the
financial
crisis
of
non
public
schools
in
low
income
areas
have
resulted
in
deferred
maintenance
and
repair
programs
and
it
had
also
resulted
in
an
increase
in
health
and
safety
hazards
to
the
children
attending
those
schools.
hereto,
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
that
the
conditions
and
problems
set
forth
in
the
legislative
findings
were
valid
and
expressed
a
secular
legislative
intent.
the
bill
provides,
as
mr.
pfeffer
said
for
a
specific
dollar
amounts
per
pupil
with
an
additional
dollar
amount
for
pupils
attending
schools
in
buildings
constructed
prior
to
1947
and
would
be
paid
to
the
schools
as
a
partial
reimbursement
for
prior
expenditures
for
repairs
and
maintenance.
the
expenditure
of
the
money
we
submit
is
safeguard
in
two
ways.
first,
the
amount
may
not
exceed
50%
of
the
state
wide
average
cost
of
maintenance
repair
in
the
public
schools
and
may
not
exceed
the
actual
amount
paid
by
the
non-public
school
in
the
preceding
base
year.
further,
not
all
non-public
schools
were
qualified
for
grants
under
this
program.
only
those
schools
will
qualify
which
have
been
certified
as
serving
a
high
concentration
of
low
income
pupils
for
the
purposes
of
title
iv
from
the
federal
higher
education
act
of
1965.
title
iv
involves
the
specific
grants
to
a
teacher
to
read
and
teach
for
educational
purposes
for
persons
and
educational
institutions
who
are
preparing
for
teaching,
who
will
agree
to
teach
in
low
income
areas.
the
schools
involved
in
this
will
be
approximately
some
250
out
of
1400
non
public
schools
in
the
state
of
new
york.
in
perspective,
we
must
observe
that
this
court
has
never
held
at
all
direct
payments
to
non-public
schools
were
unconstitutional.
now
you
must
also
state
that
there
is
a
long
tradition
of
federal
as
well
as
state
aid
to
the
non-public
schools
in
the
form
of
special
benefits
and
direct
payments
to
either
the
schools
or
their
students.
to
use
as
example,
the
school
lunch
program,
tax
exemptions,
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights
and
the
programs
and
benefits
under
the
federal
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965.
we
cite
many
other
instances
in
our
brief
on
this
appeal.
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
payments
and
benefits
so
provided
had
been
considered
not
to
aid
religion
but
rather
to
have
some
other
public
and
secular
purpose.
the
statute
here
at
issue
we
submit
was
adopted
in
the
exercise
of
the
state’s
police
power
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
children
of
the
state.
contrary
to
the
argument
mr.
pfeffer
seem
to
advance,
we
do
not
consider
and
we
do
not
complete
with
the
court’s
decisions
have
ever
considered
that
the
police
power
was
directly
related
to
what
we
normally
consider
as
crime
policing.
police
power
has
had
its
purpose
and
activity
in
various
fields
of
health
and
safety
far
beyond
the
normal
criminal
justice
system.
the
latitude
which
has
been
inscribed
to
the
police
power
by
the
courts
is
very
great.
this
court
has
indeed
held
that
the
state
has
a
sovereign
right
to
protect
the
welfare
of
its
people.
and
while
most
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
relate
to
regulatory
statutes
adopted
in
an
exercise
of
the
police
power,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
essential,
legal
or
constitutional
difference
between
statutes
which
regulate
and
statutes
which
provide
money
to
accomplish
the
desired
police
power
purpose.
in
fact,
the
everson
case,
as
mr.
pfeffer
said,
we
submit
supports
this
because
this
court
in
everson
upheld
bus
transportation
on
the
basis
that
as
a
police
power
measure,
designed
to
get
children
safely
to
non-public
schools
to
protect
them
from
the
hazards
of,
as
this
court
said
of
either
hitchhiking,
walking
a
high-rise.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor,
that's
a
correct
statement.
i
would
think
it
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
in
this
respect,
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
it
was
a
police
power
statute.
it
had
a
--
it
was
not
intended
to
benefit
religious
schools.
it
was
not
intended
to
benefit
religion,
it
was
not
intended
to
benefit
the
schools
essentially
as
institutions.
it
was
intended
as
an
exercise
of
the
police
power
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
children,
the
state’s
citizen
children
who
were
attending
these
non
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
i
think
this
is
what
we
get
to
from
there.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
all
right.
well,
we
advance
the
police
power
i
think
as
a
--
to
demonstrate
the
secular
intent,
the
legislative
purpose
of
this.
contrary
to
mr.
pfeffer’s
argument,
we
do
not
see
in
the
language
of
the
first
amendment
a
direct
prohibition
against
aid
to
parochial
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
think
that
they
could
at
least
contribute
the
money
to
rehabilitate
the
structure.
the
state
does
this
now
not
in
terms
of
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
i
don't
think
we
go
--
i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far
because
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
we
are
trying
to
protect
the
safety
of
children
in
the
buildings
they
attend.
now
if
the
building
were
in
such
a
case
that
it
had
to
be
condemned,
to
be
torn
down,
but
it
could
not
be
rehabilitated.
to
that
extent
then
there
is
no
question
of
the
safety
of
the
children
in
the
building
in
which
they
are
attending.
that
would
be
--
that's
a
different
question.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
think
no.
i
think
that
the
difference
is
one
of
the
state’s
interest
in
protecting
children
who
are,
for
whom
the
state
acts
in
a
different
plain
and
certainly
from
the
adults
who
would
be
attending
seminary.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
where
all
they
taught
was
religion?
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
think
no
because
we're
talking
here
about
--
we're
talking
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
it
limits
the
police
power
because
in
that
extent,
i
suppose
we
would
say
that
the
money
would
be
going
directly
to
the
aid
of
religion,
if
all
the
school
taught
was
religion.
here
we're
talking
about
schools
which
mean
things
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
i
don't
think
we
get
into
that.
i
don't
think
it
is
half-n-half
and
40-60.
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
what
the
state
is
doing,
is
that
it's
relating
to
the
children
who
attend
schools
which
meet
the
requirements
of
a
secular
education
for
whom
the
state
takes
its
interest,
to
whom
the
state
has
this
interest
in
relating
to
their
education.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
that's
its
whole
reason.
it's
the
enforcement,
the
compulsory
attendance
and
the
compulsory
attendance
law
does
more
than
just
say
whether
the
student
goes
to
school
on
a
particular
day.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
precisely
and
this
case,
the
state’s
interest
is
that
these
students
have
a
right
to
go
to
these
non-public
schools
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
this
compulsory
education
law,
for
the
purpose
of
attending
these
non-public
schools,
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
secular
education
to
that
extent
that
the
state
has
the
--
not
only
a
power
of
supervision
of
the
schools
but
also
the
right
to
get
in
to
the
issue
of
the
health
and
safety
of
the
structures
which
they
attend.
to
this
extent,
we
say
that
this
is
a
--
that
the
primary
intent
in
affect
of
the
statute
was
not
aid
to
religion,
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment
that
it
did
and
the
health
and
safety
grants
also
complies
with
the
constitutional
mandate
and
the
intent
of
the
first
amendment.
briefly,
i
should
like
to
mention
the
tuition
reimbursement
portion
of
the
statute.
it
is
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
part
two
of
the
section
2
of
the
statute,
yes.
first
of
all,
that
the
tuition
reimbursement
provides
for
a
payment
to
low
income
parents
of
the
lesser
of
two
amounts.
either
50%
of
the
tuition
paid
to
the
non-public
school
or
$50.00
per
child
per
year
in
elementary
school
or
$100.00
in
secondary
school
so
lesser
of
those
two
amounts.
we
say
that
this
is
equivalent
to
the
--
to
those
other
public
measures
which
enable
parents
--
in
which
the
state
participates
in
the
assistance
of
low
income
or
indigent
parents
or
indigent
persons.
before
lunch,
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
concerning
the
adc
payments.
new
york
state
as
the
court
may
be
aware
has
the
flat
grant
system
of
payment
to
adc
to
welfare
recipients,
but
prior
to
that
time,
prior
to
the
time
that
the
flat
grant
system
was
introduced,
where
there
were
categorical
grants
for
various
things
such
as
rent,
heat,
food
allowances,
clothing
allowances
and
so
forth,
the
state
education
law
required
payments
for
the
educational
expenses
of
children
and
this
was
interpreted
to
include
not
only
tuition
to
non-public
schools,
but
also
the
expenses
of
books,
clothes
which
would
include
uniforms
for
non-public
schools,
educational
supplies
and
so
forth.
and
since
the
flat
grant
option,
the
pressure
increased
upon
the
legislature
for
the
benefit
of
the
low
income
parents
were
directly
related
to
the
fact
that
they
no
longer
were
getting
this
assistance
which
they
had
in
the
past
for
the
purpose
of
tuition,
reimbursement
as
well
as
other
expenses
of
children
attending
non-public
schools.
along
with
that
and
there
has
been
additional
feeling
within
the
legislature
that
the
--
since
low
income
parents
as
well
as
upper
income
parents
have
a
constitutional
right
to
send
their
children
to
non
public
schools,
that
they
should
not
be
deprived
of
this
right
solely
because
of
their
lack
of
income.
we
have
equated
this
to
some
degree
with
the
welfare
system,
with
the
provision
of
low
income
housing,
with
the
state’s
provision
of
certain
benefits
in
the
way
of
transcripts
of
administrative
hearings
and
so
forth
to
persons
who
have
low
income
or
who
are
poverty
stricken.
to
this
extent
we
submit
that
the
low
income
portion
of
the
statute
was
itself
intended
not
to
benefit
the
schools,
it
is
paid
to
the
parents
long
after
the
tuition
has
been
paid.
it
is
not
--
they
are
not
used
as
a
conduit
for
the
payment
to
the
schools.
there
is
here
no
direct
aid
to
the
schools
and
the
only
indirect
aid
results
from
the
fact
that
the
attendance
at
non-public
schools
may
be
made
easier
for
some
children,
a
benefit
which
this
court
has
held,
does
not
constitute,
an
unconstitutional
aid
in
religion
in
and
of
itself.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
there
have
to
be
an
appropriation
periodically.
all
money
is
to
be
paid
out
of
the
state
treasury
and
subject
to
appropriation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
annually.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
annually.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
it
is
not,
for
purpose
by
the
effect
that
the
state
constitutional
provision
which
prohibits
any
payment
out
of
the
state
treasury
unless
there
is
a
specific
appropriation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
to
this
extent.
the
school
must
of
course
comply
with
the
state’s
compulsory
education
law.
it
may
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
it
may
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion
except
as
to
its
own
--
if
it
is
a
religiously
oriented
school
as
to
its
own
religious
denomination.
in
other
words,
if
a
catholic
school
determines
to
accept
any
non-catholics,
it
could
not
discriminate
between
groups
of
non-catholics.
so
there
is
that
limitation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
persons
of
its
own
religion.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
that
would
be,
that
would
be
true.
it's
not
something
that
the
statute
looks
at.
the
statutory
enactment
is
not
concerned
with
those
requirements
of
the
school,
but
it
would
--
if
that
is
a
type
of
school
to
which
a
parent
determines
to
send
their
child,
this
would
be
permissible.
the
only
prohibition
is
against
racial
discrimination
and
then
as
i
said,
this
discrimination
between
religion
so
they
did
not
have
the
other
school.
we
have
covered
i
think
the
issue
of
severability
of
the
statute
in
our
brief
and
i
believe
that
part
of
the
argument
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
question
of
perspective
here,
we
think
that
the
validity,
constitutional
validity
of
the
statute
here
at
issue,
revolves
not
solely
around
the
precise
language
of
the
statute,
but
the
intent
and
purpose
with
which
the
new
york
state
legislature
enact
them.
the
legislature
in
1972
undertook
to
meet
certain
specific
needs
of
children
attending
non-public
schools
and
their
parents.
it
was
confronted
with
a
growing
clamor
for
tax
relief
on
the
part
of
parents
who
paid
tuition
in
the
non-public
schools
on
behalf
of
their
children
and
who
also
additionally
support
public
schools
in
the
form
of
tax
payments,
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
increasing
safety
hazards
in
non-public
schools
which
particularly
in
low
income
areas,
have
been
unable
to
meet
the
cost
of
maintenance
and
repair
essential
to
health
and
safe
structures.
further,
the
state
had
become
increasingly
cognizant
of
the
problem
faced
by
low
income
parents
in
paying
the
tuition
necessary
to
the
selection
of
a
non-public
school
education
for
their
children.
and
finally
and
while
not
directly
relevant
to
this
appeal
and
still
part
of
the
same
legislative
enactment,
in
those
areas
where
the
financial
crisis
in
the
non-public
schools
had
forced
their
closing,
the
public
schools
had
been
faced
with
increased
cost
of
education
in
general
and
particularly
in
the
cost
of
additional
physical
space
for
the
increasing
enrollments.
consequently,
in
an
attempt
to
meet
or
impart
to
alleviate
what
the
district
court
here
indeed
recognized
were
basically
secular
problems.
the
legislature,
the
state
of
new
york
adopted
chapter
414
of
the
laws
of
1972.
now,
i
will
address
myself
initially
in
this
argument
to
the
problem
with
which
mr.
pfeffer
left
off
that
of
the
income
tax
portion
of
the
legislation,
then
to
health
and
safety
grants
and
finally
to
that
portion
of
the
statute
relating
to
the
tuition
reimbursement
to
low
income
parents.
the
tax
portion
of
the
statute
provides
not
for
a
tax
credit
but
for
a
modification
of
adjusted
gross
income
for
the
purposes
of
new
york
determining
the
new
york
state
income
tax
payable.
for
new
york
state
income
tax
purposes,
the
adjusted
gross
income
is
the
same
on
both
the
federal
and
state
returns
with
the
exception
of
a
number
of
state
modifications.
there
are
additional
modifications
of
gross
income
which
are
provided
solely
in
state
law
and
not
under
the
federal
tax
returns.
for
example,
a
deduction
is
not
allowed
on
the
state
return
for
income
tax,
state
income
taxes
which
have
been
paid,
although,
it
is
allowed
on
the
federal
return
and
on
the
state
return
an
additional
modification
is
allowed
for
life
insurance
premiums
paid
although
they
are
not
allowed
on
the
federal
return.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
there
is.
it's
--
i
think
it
was
this
year.
well,
it
had
been
$150,
it's
now
less
than
that.
this
court
has
indeed
recognized
that
the
states
have
an
inherent
power
and
authority
in
enacting
tax
legislation.
the
powers
of
the
state
to
tax
its
citizens
are
coequal
with
those
of
the
federal
government
and
are
only
limited
by
this
specific
limitations
on
the
state's
power
found
in
the
federal
constitution.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
you
honor,
i
am.
we
think
it
is
particularly
significant
here
that,
in
the
cases
involving
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
income
tax
law,
this
court
upheld
the
validity
in
the
face
of
arguments
that
there
were
differences
in
the
classes
of
income
tax
deductions
or
exemptions
that
were
allowed,
that
they
were
not
uniform
as
to
all
tax
payers
and
then
some
could
claim
ones
which
others
could
not.
we
submit
that
the
new
york
legislature
in
selecting
and
enacting
a
tax
legislation
has
the
power
to
select
what
income
to
tax,
how
much
of
the
income
it
wishes
to
tax,
and
to
provide
for
deductions
and
exemptions
in
whatever
amount
and
for
whatever
purpose
it
elects.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
a
credit
is
--
a
tax
credit
is
different.
yes.
a
tax
credit
comes
off
with
the
tail
end.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
now
in
this
particular
instance,
this
comes
off
at
the
top.
this
is
a
modification
of
income
for
the
--
prior
to
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
tax
owed.
it
comes
off
at
the
beginning
of
the
tax
return.
it's
a
reduction
of
your
income
subject
to
tax.
we
submit
that
this
is
equivalent
to
in
legal
principle
to
a
deduction
or
to
an
exemption
because
it
is
a
thing
which
reduces
your
income
which
is
subject
to
tax
not
a
forgiveness
of
tax
owed.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
you
do
not.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it
is
not,
but
it
also
is
not
a
tax
credit
as
that
term
is
generally
understood
because
the
tax
credit
also
amounts
to
a
precise
dollar
amount.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
what
a
credit
is
and
this
is
not,
this
is
--
we
submit
equivalent
legal
principle
to
a
deduction
or
exemption
even
though
in
terms
of
the
actual
mechanism
by
which
it
operates,
it
doesn't
come
out
the
same
way.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
it
is
closest
to
analogy
because
your
exemption
is
not
related
to
an
actual
expenditure.
it's
a
fixed
amount.
so
it's
closest
to
an
exemption.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
and
to
that
extent,
this
is
precisely
the
same
way
that
this
does
reduce
your
taxable
income.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
no.
comes
off
the
top.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
new
york
state
has
actually
had
a
history
of
tax
credits
which
have
not
been
related
to
specific
purposes.
there
have
been
a
tax
credit
to
single
or
married
people
which
is
directed
at
reducing
in
tax
owed.
for
example,
for
a
single
person
1254,
a
married
couple
$25
reduction
and
up
until
this
past
year,
we
have
taken
off
as
a
tax
credit
of
the
income
tax
after
it's
been
computed.
this
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
a
true
credit.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
now,
this
on
the
other
hand,
the
modification
of
gross
income,
starts
at
the
top
of
the
income
tax
return
and
this
comes
off
before
you
compute
your
tax
liability,
comes
off
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
except
there
is
--
it's
figure
is
slightly
differently
since
it's
figured
differently
in
amounts
but
it
comes
off
at
that
part
of
the
tax
return,
it
comes
off
in
that
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
it
varies
based
upon
income.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
persons
with
an
income
of
less
than
$9,000
or
less,
it's
a
thousand
dollars,
if
your
income
is
between
--
i
think
it's
20,000
and
23,999,
it's
a
$100
and
above
that
it's
a
zero
amount.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
so
that
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
right.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
would
be
up
at
that
point,
it's
up
--
in
that
point
of
part
of
the
return,
before
you
start
computing
your
taxable
income
and
tax
liability.
and
to
that
extent,
we
say
that
it
operates
much
the
same
as
the
deduction
or
exemption
and
probably
much
closer
to
an
exemption
simply
because
the
exemptions
themselves
are
set
as
fixed
amounts
which
unrelated
to
the
purpose
for
which
it's
granted.
in
other
words,
exempt,
present
exemption
of
the
federal
income
tax
is
$750.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
but
it's
also
unrelated,
it's
unrelated
to
the
actual
expenses
necessary
to
live
for
the
beneficiary
for
the
dependent
for
whom
it's
claimed.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
[laughter]
although
actually
in
new
york
state
we
are
entitled
for
an
additional
day
because
the
internal
revenue
district
office
in
massachusetts
has
a
legal
holiday
today.
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
an
exemption
also
varies
--
can
be
claimed
additionally,
there
are
additional
purposes
with
exemption
for
persons
over
65
going
and
so
forth.
so
the
exemptions
do
multiply
in
to
some
degree,
not
directly
related
to
the
number
of
persons
involved.
but
to
that
extent
because
it
is
also
not
directly
involved
in
the
question
of
the
actual
amount
spent,
we
say
that
this
is
closer
to
an
exemption
than
to
a
deduction,
but
is
a
legal
principle
equivalent
to
either
a
deduction
or
exemption
rather
than
a
tax
credit
because
it
relates
to
the
modification
of
taxable
income
prior
to
the
computation
of
the
tax
due.
we
submit
that
the
addition
of
a
modification
of
gross
income,
allowable
to
a
tuition
paying
parents
of
children
in
non
public
schools
was
no
more
and
no
less
than
exercise
of
the
state’s
inherent
power
to
determine
the
measure
of
personal
income
subject
to
taxation
by
the
state.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
i
should
also
point
out
that
in
the
medical
deductions,
for
example
from
the
federal
income
tax,
there
is
a
difference
there
really
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
claim
them
depending
upon
your
income.
the
higher
your
income,
it
is
the
less
likely
you
are
not
ever
going
to
get
a
medical
deduction
off
a
federal
income
tax.
this
initial
portion
of
the
statute,
we
submit
is
not
only
simply
an
exercise
of
the
state’s
power
of
taxation,
but
also
meets
the
secular
purpose
and
effects
which
were
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
schempp
case.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
and
as
was
specifically
found
by
the
district
court
was
to
provide
tax
relief
to
tuition
paying
parents
of
children
in
non
public
schools.
it
was
not
to
provide
aid
to
the
schools
themselves.
the
primary
effect
also
is
found
by
the
district
court
would
not
be
a
benefit
to
the
non
public
schools,
but
rather
to
the
tuition
paying
parent.
the
court
recognized
the
fact
that
by
the
time
the
parent’s
income
tax
liability
is
fixed
and
determined,
and
when
he
files
his
returns,
his
tuition
has
long
since
been
paid
and
that
any
benefit
he
gets
out
of
this
reduction
and
the
eventual
reduction
of
the
tax
which
would
be
most
likely
pocketed
by
him
and
used
for
his
own
personal
purposes
rather
than
turned
over
to
the
school.
that
it
is
in-chronologically
unrelated
to
the
time
of
paying
tuition
and
would
therefore
not
be
considered
to
be
using
the
parent
here
as
a
conduit
to
paying
money
to
the
schools.
without
payment
to
the
schools
or
any
contact
with
the
schools
attended
by
the
parent,
incidentally
on
the
new
york
state
income
tax
return
in
claiming
the
modification
of
gross
income,
a
parent
is
not
required
to
state
what
school
he
sent
the
child
to.
he
simply
adds
it
in
as
an
item
off
of
his
return
and
only
if
he
has
subsequently
audited,
would
there
be
any
question
raised
would
he
ever
have
to
prove
to
what
school
the
money
was
paid.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
i
can
get
you
one.
we
have
some
of
it
for
you.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
okay.
i
know
i
have
some
of
those.
all
right,
without
payment
to
the
schools
or
with
any
contact
with
the
schools
attended
by
the
children,
we
submit
that
there
can
be
no
entanglement
between
governor,
religion,
let
alone
excessive
entanglement.
the
provision
of
tax
relief
to
parents
can
in
no
way
be
construed
as
an
unconstitutional
aid
to
religion.
there
is
here
no
first
amendment
violation
in
the
district
court’s
judgment
and
that
should
be
affirmed.
as
to
section
1
of
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
only
if
his
income
is
less
than
$5000.00,
then
he
would
have
to
make
the
choice.
the
purpose
of
that
of
course
is
simply
to
see
they
do
not
get
a
double
benefit.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
true.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
i
assume
that
would
be
true.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
it's
over
--
if
your
income
is
over
$24,000.00
a
year,
you
cannot
take
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
you
cannot
take
the
tax
relief
and
if
your
income
is
over
$5000.00,
you
cannot
take
the
tuition
reimbursement.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
assume
that
that
would
be
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
think
so
because
there
would
be
no.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
it
does,
goes
progressively
down.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
and
apparently
it's
assumed
that
if
your
income
is
over
$24000.00
you
can
afford
to
send
your
children
to
non-public
schools
without
needing
any
tax
relief.
i
am
sure
their
parents
would
disagree
with
that
but
that
was
a
legislative
philosophy
behind
it.
getting
to
section
1
of
the
statute,
the
so-called
health
and
safety
grants,
the
legislature
specifically
found
that
the
financial
crisis
of
non
public
schools
in
low
income
areas
have
resulted
in
deferred
maintenance
and
repair
programs
and
it
had
also
resulted
in
an
increase
in
health
and
safety
hazards
to
the
children
attending
those
schools.
hereto,
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
that
the
conditions
and
problems
set
forth
in
the
legislative
findings
were
valid
and
expressed
a
secular
legislative
intent.
the
bill
provides,
as
mr.
pfeffer
said
for
a
specific
dollar
amounts
per
pupil
with
an
additional
dollar
amount
for
pupils
attending
schools
in
buildings
constructed
prior
to
1947
and
would
be
paid
to
the
schools
as
a
partial
reimbursement
for
prior
expenditures
for
repairs
and
maintenance.
the
expenditure
of
the
money
we
submit
is
safeguard
in
two
ways.
first,
the
amount
may
not
exceed
50%
of
the
state
wide
average
cost
of
maintenance
repair
in
the
public
schools
and
may
not
exceed
the
actual
amount
paid
by
the
non-public
school
in
the
preceding
base
year.
further,
not
all
non-public
schools
were
qualified
for
grants
under
this
program.
only
those
schools
will
qualify
which
have
been
certified
as
serving
a
high
concentration
of
low
income
pupils
for
the
purposes
of
title
iv
from
the
federal
higher
education
act
of
1965.
title
iv
involves
the
specific
grants
to
a
teacher
to
read
and
teach
for
educational
purposes
for
persons
and
educational
institutions
who
are
preparing
for
teaching,
who
will
agree
to
teach
in
low
income
areas.
the
schools
involved
in
this
will
be
approximately
some
250
out
of
1400
non
public
schools
in
the
state
of
new
york.
in
perspective,
we
must
observe
that
this
court
has
never
held
at
all
direct
payments
to
non-public
schools
were
unconstitutional.
now
you
must
also
state
that
there
is
a
long
tradition
of
federal
as
well
as
state
aid
to
the
non-public
schools
in
the
form
of
special
benefits
and
direct
payments
to
either
the
schools
or
their
students.
to
use
as
example,
the
school
lunch
program,
tax
exemptions,
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights
and
the
programs
and
benefits
under
the
federal
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965.
we
cite
many
other
instances
in
our
brief
on
this
appeal.
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
payments
and
benefits
so
provided
had
been
considered
not
to
aid
religion
but
rather
to
have
some
other
public
and
secular
purpose.
the
statute
here
at
issue
we
submit
was
adopted
in
the
exercise
of
the
state’s
police
power
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
children
of
the
state.
contrary
to
the
argument
mr.
pfeffer
seem
to
advance,
we
do
not
consider
and
we
do
not
complete
with
the
court’s
decisions
have
ever
considered
that
the
police
power
was
directly
related
to
what
we
normally
consider
as
crime
policing.
police
power
has
had
its
purpose
and
activity
in
various
fields
of
health
and
safety
far
beyond
the
normal
criminal
justice
system.
the
latitude
which
has
been
inscribed
to
the
police
power
by
the
courts
is
very
great.
this
court
has
indeed
held
that
the
state
has
a
sovereign
right
to
protect
the
welfare
of
its
people.
and
while
most
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
relate
to
regulatory
statutes
adopted
in
an
exercise
of
the
police
power,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
essential,
legal
or
constitutional
difference
between
statutes
which
regulate
and
statutes
which
provide
money
to
accomplish
the
desired
police
power
purpose.
in
fact,
the
everson
case,
as
mr.
pfeffer
said,
we
submit
supports
this
because
this
court
in
everson
upheld
bus
transportation
on
the
basis
that
as
a
police
power
measure,
designed
to
get
children
safely
to
non-public
schools
to
protect
them
from
the
hazards
of,
as
this
court
said
of
either
hitchhiking,
walking
a
high-rise.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
your
honor,
that's
a
correct
statement.
i
would
think
it
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
in
this
respect,
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
it
was
a
police
power
statute.
it
had
a
--
it
was
not
intended
to
benefit
religious
schools.
it
was
not
intended
to
benefit
religion,
it
was
not
intended
to
benefit
the
schools
essentially
as
institutions.
it
was
intended
as
an
exercise
of
the
police
power
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
children,
the
state’s
citizen
children
who
were
attending
these
non
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
i
think
this
is
what
we
get
to
from
there.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
all
right.
well,
we
advance
the
police
power
i
think
as
a
--
to
demonstrate
the
secular
intent,
the
legislative
purpose
of
this.
contrary
to
mr.
pfeffer’s
argument,
we
do
not
see
in
the
language
of
the
first
amendment
a
direct
prohibition
against
aid
to
parochial
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
think
that
they
could
at
least
contribute
the
money
to
rehabilitate
the
structure.
the
state
does
this
now
not
in
terms
of
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
i
don't
think
we
go
--
i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far
because
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
we
are
trying
to
protect
the
safety
of
children
in
the
buildings
they
attend.
now
if
the
building
were
in
such
a
case
that
it
had
to
be
condemned,
to
be
torn
down,
but
it
could
not
be
rehabilitated.
to
that
extent
then
there
is
no
question
of
the
safety
of
the
children
in
the
building
in
which
they
are
attending.
that
would
be
--
that's
a
different
question.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
think
no.
i
think
that
the
difference
is
one
of
the
state’s
interest
in
protecting
children
who
are,
for
whom
the
state
acts
in
a
different
plain
and
certainly
from
the
adults
who
would
be
attending
seminary.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
where
all
they
taught
was
religion?
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
think
no
because
we're
talking
here
about
--
we're
talking
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
it
limits
the
police
power
because
in
that
extent,
i
suppose
we
would
say
that
the
money
would
be
going
directly
to
the
aid
of
religion,
if
all
the
school
taught
was
religion.
here
we're
talking
about
schools
which
mean
things
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
i
don't
think
we
get
into
that.
i
don't
think
it
is
half-n-half
and
40-60.
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
what
the
state
is
doing,
is
that
it's
relating
to
the
children
who
attend
schools
which
meet
the
requirements
of
a
secular
education
for
whom
the
state
takes
its
interest,
to
whom
the
state
has
this
interest
in
relating
to
their
education.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
that's
its
whole
reason.
it's
the
enforcement,
the
compulsory
attendance
and
the
compulsory
attendance
law
does
more
than
just
say
whether
the
student
goes
to
school
on
a
particular
day.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
precisely
and
this
case,
the
state’s
interest
is
that
these
students
have
a
right
to
go
to
these
non-public
schools
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
this
compulsory
education
law,
for
the
purpose
of
attending
these
non-public
schools,
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
secular
education
to
that
extent
that
the
state
has
the
--
not
only
a
power
of
supervision
of
the
schools
but
also
the
right
to
get
in
to
the
issue
of
the
health
and
safety
of
the
structures
which
they
attend.
to
this
extent,
we
say
that
this
is
a
--
that
the
primary
intent
in
affect
of
the
statute
was
not
aid
to
religion,
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment
that
it
did
and
the
health
and
safety
grants
also
complies
with
the
constitutional
mandate
and
the
intent
of
the
first
amendment.
briefly,
i
should
like
to
mention
the
tuition
reimbursement
portion
of
the
statute.
it
is
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
part
two
of
the
section
2
of
the
statute,
yes.
first
of
all,
that
the
tuition
reimbursement
provides
for
a
payment
to
low
income
parents
of
the
lesser
of
two
amounts.
either
50%
of
the
tuition
paid
to
the
non-public
school
or
$50.00
per
child
per
year
in
elementary
school
or
$100.00
in
secondary
school
so
lesser
of
those
two
amounts.
we
say
that
this
is
equivalent
to
the
--
to
those
other
public
measures
which
enable
parents
--
in
which
the
state
participates
in
the
assistance
of
low
income
or
indigent
parents
or
indigent
persons.
before
lunch,
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
concerning
the
adc
payments.
new
york
state
as
the
court
may
be
aware
has
the
flat
grant
system
of
payment
to
adc
to
welfare
recipients,
but
prior
to
that
time,
prior
to
the
time
that
the
flat
grant
system
was
introduced,
where
there
were
categorical
grants
for
various
things
such
as
rent,
heat,
food
allowances,
clothing
allowances
and
so
forth,
the
state
education
law
required
payments
for
the
educational
expenses
of
children
and
this
was
interpreted
to
include
not
only
tuition
to
non-public
schools,
but
also
the
expenses
of
books,
clothes
which
would
include
uniforms
for
non-public
schools,
educational
supplies
and
so
forth.
and
since
the
flat
grant
option,
the
pressure
increased
upon
the
legislature
for
the
benefit
of
the
low
income
parents
were
directly
related
to
the
fact
that
they
no
longer
were
getting
this
assistance
which
they
had
in
the
past
for
the
purpose
of
tuition,
reimbursement
as
well
as
other
expenses
of
children
attending
non-public
schools.
along
with
that
and
there
has
been
additional
feeling
within
the
legislature
that
the
--
since
low
income
parents
as
well
as
upper
income
parents
have
a
constitutional
right
to
send
their
children
to
non
public
schools,
that
they
should
not
be
deprived
of
this
right
solely
because
of
their
lack
of
income.
we
have
equated
this
to
some
degree
with
the
welfare
system,
with
the
provision
of
low
income
housing,
with
the
state’s
provision
of
certain
benefits
in
the
way
of
transcripts
of
administrative
hearings
and
so
forth
to
persons
who
have
low
income
or
who
are
poverty
stricken.
to
this
extent
we
submit
that
the
low
income
portion
of
the
statute
was
itself
intended
not
to
benefit
the
schools,
it
is
paid
to
the
parents
long
after
the
tuition
has
been
paid.
it
is
not
--
they
are
not
used
as
a
conduit
for
the
payment
to
the
schools.
there
is
here
no
direct
aid
to
the
schools
and
the
only
indirect
aid
results
from
the
fact
that
the
attendance
at
non-public
schools
may
be
made
easier
for
some
children,
a
benefit
which
this
court
has
held,
does
not
constitute,
an
unconstitutional
aid
in
religion
in
and
of
itself.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
there
have
to
be
an
appropriation
periodically.
all
money
is
to
be
paid
out
of
the
state
treasury
and
subject
to
appropriation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
annually.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
annually.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
it
is
not,
for
purpose
by
the
effect
that
the
state
constitutional
provision
which
prohibits
any
payment
out
of
the
state
treasury
unless
there
is
a
specific
appropriation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
to
this
extent.
the
school
must
of
course
comply
with
the
state’s
compulsory
education
law.
it
may
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
it
may
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion
except
as
to
its
own
--
if
it
is
a
religiously
oriented
school
as
to
its
own
religious
denomination.
in
other
words,
if
a
catholic
school
determines
to
accept
any
non-catholics,
it
could
not
discriminate
between
groups
of
non-catholics.
so
there
is
that
limitation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
persons
of
its
own
religion.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
that
would
be,
that
would
be
true.
it's
not
something
that
the
statute
looks
at.
the
statutory
enactment
is
not
concerned
with
those
requirements
of
the
school,
but
it
would
--
if
that
is
a
type
of
school
to
which
a
parent
determines
to
send
their
child,
this
would
be
permissible.
the
only
prohibition
is
against
racial
discrimination
and
then
as
i
said,
this
discrimination
between
religion
so
they
did
not
have
the
other
school.
we
have
covered
i
think
the
issue
of
severability
of
the
statute
in
our
brief
and
i
believe
that
part
of
the
argument
--
