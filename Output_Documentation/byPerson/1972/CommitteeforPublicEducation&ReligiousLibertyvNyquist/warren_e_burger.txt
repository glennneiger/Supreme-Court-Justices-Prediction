we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
consolidated
cases
72-694,
753,
791,
and
929.
mr.
pfeffer
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
of
part
one
aspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
grants
for
under
the
gi
program,
that
--
to
the
tuition
to
georgetown
law
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
your
position
on
that
point
be
different,
if
it
in
a
particular
area
that
brought
the
case
to
us
if
they
were
80
%
lutheran
and
20
%
catholic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
of
it
was
80
%
private
nondenominational
and
20
%
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
since
you
again
emphasize
those
percentages,
what
would
be
the
situation
in
your
view
if
they
were
reversed
96
%
private
secular
schools,
4
%
private
sectarian
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
these
percentages
aren't
of
any
relevance
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
walz
case,
it
was
not
directed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
didn't
concern
ourselves
with
trying
to
weigh
and
measure
the
proportions,
well
then
why
should
we
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
it's
964
or
496?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
g.i.
has
simply
became
the
conduit
then,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
did
they
not
under
the
gi
bill,
have
some
process
of
inspection
and
certification
after
a
period
when
there
were
some
fraudulent
schools,
spurious
operations,
did
they
not
then
establish
regulations
under
the
statute
which
required
the
school
to
meet
a
particular
standard
so
that
the
government
checked
on
whether
this
money
was
being
used
wisely
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
continuing
surveillance
of
all
private
schools
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
there
not
to
see
that
they
meet
the
standards
established
by
the
board
of
education?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
not
found
objectionable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of
the
general
surveillance
of
all
non-public
schools
that's
not
the
constitutionally
objectionable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
did
not
--
i
think
give
us
the
citation
of
your
missouri
case
cited
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
you
repeat
that
last
cite
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
reverse
of
that
is
true
also?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
let
you
answer
that
after
lunch
mr.
pfeffer.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
pfeffer
you
have
about
15
minutes
of
your
time
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
pfeffer.
mrs.
coon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
limit
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
might
be
helpful
to
all
of
us.
i
suggest
that
copies
to
your
firms
that
if
you
would
submit
some
illustrations
as
to
just
how
that
works,
it
might
be
helpful.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
possibly
be
true
if
he
had
too
much
income?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
function
at
any
point
the
way
the
medical
deduction
does
in
the
federal,
you
had
an
analogy
to
that
and
i
am
not
sure
i
followed
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
none
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
to
pursue
that
for
a
moment
then.
it
might
be
perfectly
valid
as
applied
to
a
secular
school,
a
private
non-denominational
school
and
i
take
it
mr.
pfeffer
would
not
question
that
if
the
state
decided
to
make
grants.
it
runs
afoul,
the
first
amendment
as
justice
stewart
and
justice
rehnquist
suggested
if
it
runs
afoul
as
soon
as
you
bring
--
introduce
this
other
element.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what
if,
for
example
mrs.
coon,
the
school,
the
building
was
condemned,
it
was
in
such
a
bad
state
of
repair.
it
was
condemned
because
it
was
hazardous
to
the
health,
the
safety
of
the
stairways.
it
was
a
fire
hazard
and
a
lot
of
other
things.
in
your
view,
could
the
state
of
new
york
contribute
the
money
to
build
a
new
building
under
the
exercise
of
its
police
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
this
case,
but
i
am
speaking
of
now,
the
new
building,
could
they
say
we
now
condemn
it,
we’ll
tear
it
down,
we’re
going
to
put
up
a
new
building
and
we,
the
state
of
new
york
will
pay
for
it.
you
think
they
could
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
part
two,
is
it
or
is
it
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
coon.
mr.
chandler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
chandler.
mr.
haggerty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
the
people
under
$5,000
are
not
paying
--
in
new
york
city
to
the
people
under
$5,000
five
children
pay
any
taxes
to
the
state
of
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they’re
paying
sales
taxes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
suppose
implicit
in
your
answer
is
that
in
very
few
schools
would
the
chapel
exceed
50%
of
the
total
heated
space,
is
that
a
reasonable
assumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
haggerty.
i
got
to
limit
myself
to
one
question
to
on
your
rebuttal
mr.
pfeffer.
suppose
you
had
--
i
start
with
your
comment
this
morning
that
there
is
no
constitutional
barrier
to
the
state
of
new
york
provided
funds
and
tax
credits
to
private,
secular
schools.
would
you
have
such
a
private
secular
school
maintained
by
anti-religious
people
and
all
these
credits
were
given,
does
that
give
rise
to
any
possibility
of
violation
of
equal
protection
or
possibly
the
free
exercise
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
free
exercise
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
my
hypothetical,
i
wasn't
assuming
that
they
had
a
sign
on
the
building
that
this
is
an
anti-religious
school.
i
am
simply
assuming
it's
a
secular
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
patronized
by
people
who
do
not
want
their
children
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
give
you
any
equal
protection
problem
in
this
respect?
chief

warren
e.

you
mr.
pfeffer.
