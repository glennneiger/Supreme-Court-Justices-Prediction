justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
--
the
person
cannot
come
with
a
receipted
bill
from
a
private
nondenominational
school.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
the
g,i,
bill
although
the
tuition
money
went
directly
to
the
schools,
it
did
not
go
through
the
hands
of
the
recipient
or
the
student?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
certainly
didn't,
when
i
was
on
the
g.i.
bill
which
was
for
some
four
or
five
years
the
tuition
just
simply
went
to
the
school.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
the
parochial
parents
action
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
to
require
the
states
to
--
that's
somewhat
different
context.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
coon.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
precise
manner
in
which
this
new
york
tax
--
the
portion
of
the
statute
dealing
with
tax
operates?
it
came
up
by
knowing
question
during
mr.
pfeffer’s
argument
as
to
whether
it's
a
credit
or
a
deduction
or
an
exclusion,
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
precise
manner
in
which
it
operates?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
close
this
too
an
exemption
for
that
you
get,
for
dependents
on
your
federal
income
tax
return,
isn't
that
closest
analogy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
really
doesn't
answer
your
problem
here
though,
does
it?
if
it
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power,
that
means
you
have
got
the
first
conclude,
it
doesn't
violate
the
first
amendment
and
if
it
doesn't
violate
the
first
amendment,
it
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.
pfeffer
you
say
this
is
a
tax
credit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
how
do
you
define
a
tax
credit
as
opposed
to
a
deduction
or
an
exemption
when
you
are
using
that
term?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
your
definition
of
tax
credit
is
a
broader
one
than
the
one
which
would
simply
say
a
tax
credit
is
an
amount
you
subtract
from
the
otherwise
computed
tax
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
will
you
answer
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it
is
a
broader
definition
than
the
one
i
just
mentioned
to
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you
get
is
something
that
you
are
entitled
to
subtract
from
your
adjusted
gross
income,
not
something
which
is
entitled
to
subtract
from
the
tax
that
you
have
already
computed
to
be
due?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
make
that
same
argument
if
you
are
simply
here
dealing
with
an
orthodox
tax
deduction,
that
the
whole
purpose
was
to
get
money
to
the
private
schools?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
suppose
that
you
weren't
dealing
with
a
gift
here,
that
you
are
dealing
with
someone
who
is
obviously
a
payment
for
services
rendered,
tuition
and
the
state
made
that
simply
deductible?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
--
the

cannot
come
with
a
