this
should
be
like
the
box
that
goes
over
and
how
many
exemptions
you
have.
this
would
be
like
another
box,
right
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
a
flat
amount?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
would
be
up
in
that
level.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
returns.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
they
found
a
seminary
that
was
--
all
the
seminaries
were
in
complete
need
of
rehabilitation,
the
same
findings
that
they
made
here
as
the
elementary
and
high
school,
would
you
say
the
state
could
contribute
to
all
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
found
that
all
of
the
church
schools
were
in
need
of
rehabilitation,
where
all
they
taught
was
religion,
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
huh,
huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
first
amendment
does
limit
the
police
power?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don’t
let
me
get
to
the
half-n-half
and
40-60.
now
i
think
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
the
interest
of
the
--
the
interest
of
the
state
in
supervising
the
private
schools,
what
is
the
state’s
reason
for
that
other
than
the
enforcement
of
its
compulsory
attendance
law?
what
other
reason
does
the
state
have
to
supervise
these
schools?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
state’s
only
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
of
course
recognized
that
he
knew
about
that
when
he
paid
the
money
to
the
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
of
course.
