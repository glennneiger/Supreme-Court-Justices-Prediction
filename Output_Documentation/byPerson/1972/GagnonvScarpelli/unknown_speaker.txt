unknown
speaker
what
specific
part
of
morrissey
are
you
saying
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
far
we’re
talking
about
when
somebody
is
taken
into
custody
before
he
can
be
moved
back
to
prison,
he
has
to
have
a
hearing,
sometimes
a
preliminary
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
will
it
require
a
hearing
before
you
can
put
him
in
custody
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
you
don’t
have
a
compact
in
state
and
one
of
your
probation
parolee
goes
to
another
state
and
is
--
unknown
speaker
not
absconded,
he’s
arrested
there.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
morrissey
that
he
have
always
been.
unknown
speaker
now,
but
to
extradite
him,
you
will
have
to
show
some
kind
--
that
they’ve
something
to
show
you.
unknown
speaker
but
he
had
some
sworn
statement
or
something.
that
would
be
subject
with
the
ordinarily
be
simply
proved
to
provide
how
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
with
this
whole
evidentiary
hearing
at
all
--.
unknown
speaker
no,
or
for
the
preliminary
hearing
in
morrissey?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
first
step?
unknown
speaker
well,
for
what
purpose?
unknown
speaker
for
final
action.
unknown
speaker
alright
and
what
about
the
burden
--
unknown
speaker
what
about
affidavits?
what
about
hearsays?
unknown
speaker
he
may
rely
on
a
great
many
things.
unknown
speaker
he
may
rely
on
a
great
many
things
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
but
did
your
statement
that
the
power
to
revoke
or
the
evidence
that
you
may
base
revocation
on
is
similar
to
that
a
judge
may
rely
on
re-sentencing?
unknown
speaker
what
becomes
the
confrontation
then?
i
mean,
that’s
sort
of
unregulated
hearsay
--.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
just
wanted
to
what
extent
morrissey
has
said
that
is
wrong.
it’s
not
tenable
any
longer
in
the
revocation
hearing.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
morrissey
opinion
didn’t
address
itself?
unknown
speaker
unless
the
morrissey
got
something,
unless
you
take
that
morrissey
really
requires
confrontation,
the
interstate
problems
are
negligible.
unknown
speaker
under
whose
constitution?
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
abandoning
your
claim
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel?
unknown
speaker
how
can
it
be
moot
if
the
counsel
issue
was
validly
here
and
you
have
an
abandonment.
is
there
going
to
be
hearing
at
which
you
claim
you
have
the
right
to
counsel?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
have
to
if
morrissey
against
brewer
said
it
wasn’t
that
way.
unknown
speaker
i
like
that
surprise.
unknown
speaker
does
wisconsin
permit
lawyers
to
be
present
with
the
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
so,
this
is
under
the
--
this
is
based
on
the
federal
constitution
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
or
under
the
wisconsin
constitution?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
situation
where
parole
revocation
is
based
on
a
on
or
a
report
will
be
based
on
conviction
of
another
crime.
that
a
certified
copy
of
the
conviction
present,
they
keep
the
man
there
without
counsel
and
they
revoke
his
hearing,
they
revoke
his
probation.
in
that
situation
would
the
revocation
be
invalid
with
the
absence
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
there
were
due
process
arguments
in
those
situations
where
it
would’ve
been
critical
to
have
counsel
present,
you
should
have
had
counsel
but
it’s
beyond
the
situations
where
it
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
with
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
it
drawn
that
line?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
have
not
--
have
they
drawn
any
line
at
all?
unknown
speaker
if
they
purported
to
be
implying
the
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
well,
again
i
asked
though
that
since
you’re
relying
on
due
process
clause
you
are
nevertheless
saying
or
are
you
saying
that
has
the
invariable
principle
or
invariable
rule,
you
must
have
counsel
with
probation
and
parole
revocation
hearing.
