chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
71-1225,
gagnon
against
scarpelli.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
platz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
gagnon
and
we’ll
observe
the
french
pronunciation
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
describing
that
the
conduct
which
led
to
the
revocation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it,
the
essence
of
your
mootness
argument
is
that
since
the
sentence
has
six
or
seven
years
yet
to
run,
he
may
have
his
parole
revoked
again
and
be
back
in.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
pick
up
at
that
point
right
after
lunch.
mr.
platz,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
facilities
that
are
involved
in
the
interstate
compact
that
is
assuming
you
had
two
states
who
were
parties
to
that
interstate
compact.
as
between
illinois
and
wisconsin,
you
wouldn’t
really
have
a
problem,
would
you,
if
you
use
the
facilities
and
personnel
of
the
illinois
system
to
execute
the
functions
placed
on
it
by
morrissey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
morrissey
is
not
an
evidentiary
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
a
probable
cause
here.
it
say
here
explicitly
that
this
could
be
done
in
the
most
informal
way
by
statements
of
the
parole
officer
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
no
one
of
us
can
give
advisory
opinions.
i
think
you
are
aware
of
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
conviction
would
be
enough.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
certainly
is
clear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
necessarily
in
person,
parole
hearings
can
be
conducted
on
interrogatories
or
any
other
such
method.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
can
do
it
in
a
ordinary
law
suit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’ve
forgotten
from
your
brief,
how
many
states
are
in
the
interstate
compact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
in
the
case
of
morrissey
--
morrissey
may
require
some
modifications
of
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
compact
to
extend
these
additional
services.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
speaking
now
of
counsel
at
the
probable
cause
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
consider
that
the
matters
which
a
judge
can
consider
in
sentencing
co-extensive
with
the
matters
which
the
parole
board
may
consider
properly
on
revocation
of
parole
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing
in
there
that
would
indicate
a
modification
of
williams
against
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
platz.
mr.
coffey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
within
the
seven
years,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
they
purport
to
be
following
or
did
they
consider
themselves
in
anyway
bound
by
the
seventh
circuit
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
means
here,
the
counsel
issues
is
here,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
morrissey
involve
the
probation
or
parole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
morrissey
involved
probation
on
parole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
put
in
another
way,
he
is
out
in
the
same
legal
posture
as
though
his
parole
had
never
and
his
probation
had
never
been
revoked.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fact
over
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
it
require
a
disclosure
of
evidence
or
recital
of
the
ultimate
facts
or
pleading
in
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
evidence
against
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think,
if
he
in
fact
then
commit
some
time
what
happens
to
all
these
theories?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
probation,
by
and
large
or
at
least
to
put
it
in
other
way
probation
is
granted
to
first
defenders
as
the
largest
single
class
of
all
probationers,
isn’t
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
due
process
clause
of
the
wisconsin
constitution
essentially
the
same
as
the
federal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
they
decide
that
due
process
clause
or
under
the
sixth
amendment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
right
across
the
board
on
all
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
counsel
that
the
processes
of
probation
and
parole
will
--
could
get
so
weighted
down
with
burdens
that
as
a
policy
decision
the
states
might
say
for
themselves,
apart
from
the
federal
government
that
it’s
just
too
difficult
to
get
this
kind
of
a
program
working
and
so
we’ll
abandon
it.
is
that
possible
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
state
of
wisconsin
for
example,
created
a
core
staff
of
lawyers
attached
to
these
institutions
of
confinement
on
a
permanent
basis
and
just
by
rotation
furnished
them
as
counsel,
would
that
satisfy
your
due
process
claim
to
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
argersinger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
these
have
to
be
lawyers
admitted
to
practice
or
can
they
be
trained
personnel
short
of
being
lawyers
admitted
to
practice
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
in
scarpelli’s
case,
it
was
pretty
well
established
that
he
was
associating
with
the
known
criminal
because
the
man
was
shot
and
killed
by
the
police
in
the
course
of
committing
a
robbery,
wasn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
died
that
shortly
after?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
at
least
made
a
reasonable
case
that
he
was
associating
with
known
criminals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
coffey,
you
have
given
us
your
subjective
evaluation
and
these
things
are
some
things
are
sometimes
helpful?
your
own
evaluation
based
on
your
own
experience
but
from
that
same
experience
would
you
say
that
there’s
any
evidence
that
probation
and
parole
officers
tend
to
be
prosecution-minded
that
they’re
trying
to
get
people
off
the
street
and
back
into
institutions
or
is
the
contrary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
the
widely
accepted
the
proposition
in
community
of
professional
probation
and
parole
people
that
every
return
to
the
prison
represents
a
failure
of
the
supervising
officer?
isn’t
that
our
own
standard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
read
as
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
probably
in
the
morrissey
opinion
also.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
converting
your
men
to
an
adversary
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
coffey.
thank
you,
mr.
platz.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
