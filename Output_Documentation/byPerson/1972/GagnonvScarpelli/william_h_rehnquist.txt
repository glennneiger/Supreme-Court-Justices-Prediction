month-to-month
basis
over

you

you
don’t
have
a
right

justice
william

but
don’t
you
have
to
--
don’t
you
have
to,
do
you
have
to
say
that
morrissey
against
brewer
was
retroactive
to
come
up
with
that
result?
justice
william

is
scarpelli
out
now

is
he
confined?
justice
william

your
position
is
he
is
out
just
as
if
he

served
an
expired
sentence
in

was
freed
at
the
end
of

mr.
coffey,
if
this
court
should
disagree
with
the
seventh
circuit
decision
in
this
case
and
say
that
counsel
is
not
required
in
a
probation
revocation
hearing,
would
there
be
an
independent
state
right
to
counsel
either
under
a
case
law
or
statute
in
wisconsin
apart
from
the
federal
constitution?

parole
revocation,
is
there
anything
corresponding
to
a
prosecuting
attorney
the
way
you
have
in
a
criminal
case

is
it
more

just
the

calling
a
