mr.
william
a.
platz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
a.
platz
i
might
mentioned
that
my
client
pronounces
his
name
in
a
french
way,
it’s
gagnon.
mr.
william
a.
platz
this
case
commenced
actually
on
july
9,
1965
when
gerald
scarpelli
was
convicted
in
wisconsin
of
armed
robbery
in
the
same
county
and
was
placed
on
probation
for
a
period
of
seven
years
in
the
custody
of
what
was
then
the
state
department
of
public
welfare
which
has
control
of
all
probationers
and
parolees
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
he
was
also
at
the
same
time
sentenced
to
a
term
of
15
years
in
the
wisconsin
state
prison
and
that
execution
of
the
sentence
was
stayed
pending
the
seven
years
probation.
he
was
permitted
to
leave
the
state
of
wisconsin
pursuant
to
the
interstate
compact
for
out
of
state
parolee
supervision
and
go
to
the
state
of
illinois
where
he
resided.
his
residence
was
in
a
suburb
of
chicago
and
he
was
employed
in
another
suburb
of
chicago.
he
was
accepted
for
supervision
by
the
cook
county
probation
department
pursuant
to
the
interstate
compact
on
august
5th,
1965.
and
on
friday
august
6th,
the
following
day,
a
home
in
deerfield,
illinois
which
is
a
northern
suburb
of
chicago
and
is
quite
some
distance
north
from
scarpelli’s
residence
and
from
his
place
of
employment
was
burglarized
during
the
day
time
in
the
morning
and
news
of
this
came
to
the
department
of
public
welfare
which
saw
a
news
article
in
the
chicago
tribune
which
contained
two
photographs
including
one
of
our
probationer
scarpelli
and
also
a
statement
which
he
gave
to
the
assistant
state’s
attorney
of
lake
county,
illinois
in
which
he
made
a
full
confession
of
his
part
in
the
burglary.
the
co-defendant
or
the
other
burglar
was
also
his
co-defendant
in
the
wisconsin
robbery
of
which
he
had
been
previously
convicted.
i
think
fred
kleckner,
the
other
robber,
the
other
burglar
in
illinois
was
not
at
that
time
convicted
in
wisconsin.
kleckner
was
shot
leaving
the
burglar
premises
and
scarpelli
however
escaped
and
was
not
taken
in
the
custody
for
some
little
time.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
is
what
i’m
describing
now,
the
conduct
which
led
to
the
revocation.
now,
at
that
time
in
wisconsin,
the
law
was
that
there
was
no
right
to
a
hearing
on
revocation
of
probation.
our
law
on
probation
was
enacted
in
1909,
two
years
after
our
parole
law.
the
parole
law
had
placed
parolees
in
the
custody
of
the
old
board
of
control
which
later
became
the
department
of
public
welfare
and
two
years
later
in
1909,
the
legislature
enacted
the
probation
law
under
which
the
courts
could
either
impose
sentence
and
stay
execution
thereof
and
place
them
on
probation
under
the
custody
and
control
of
the
same
department
which
had
control
of
parolees
and
under
the
same
rules
and
regulations
or
could
withhold
sentence
all
together
and
place
them
on
probation.
in
the
case
of
scarpelli,
it
was
the
case
of
the
sentence
being
imposed
and
execution
staid.
now,
originally
in
wisconsin,
the
probation
law
required
that
before
probation
be
revoked,
there
be
a
hearing.
the
law
said
a
personal
hearing,
a
full
investigation
and
personal
hearing.
in
1947,
that
provision
was
removed
in
the
course
of
the
revision
of
the
statute
and
there
had
been
no
hearing
since
then.
this
court
in
escoe
v.
zerbst
did
held
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing
on
revocation
or
probation.
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes,
your
honor.
and
since
before
that
too
but
what
i
mean
is
up
until
the
time
of
this
case,
there
had
been
no
action.
now,
this
case
was
commenced
in
the
federal
court
in
december
of
1968
which
was
over
three
years
after
the
revocation.
and
it
took
quite
a
while
it
was
1970
before
it
was
decided
in
the
court,
in
the
district
court.
we
lost
in
the
district
court.
we
appealed
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
we
lost
there
it
took
about
almost
a
year
for
that
to
be
decided
and
we
applied
for
certiorari
in
this
court
which
was
granted
at
the
end
of
june.
counsel
now
takes
the
position
that
the
case
has
become
moot
because
the
original
seven
years
of
probation,
counter
years
has
expired,
i
have
filed
a
reply
a
brief
and
answering
this
claim
of
mootness
and
in
order
to
have
more
time
to
discuss
the
merits,
i
really
preferred
to
leave
the
mootness
to
my
reply
brief.
i
consider
that
the
case
is
not
moot,
that
we
have
a
right,
if
we
have
committed
constitutionally,
we
have
a
right
to
correct
it
and
to
correct
it
now
even
though
the
original
seven
counter
years
have
expired.
actually
at
the
time
this
matter
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
probationer
scarpelli
had
been
released
on
parole
to
meet
a
federal
charge
and
had
already
been
tried
federally
and
was
then
in
(inaudible)
in
the
federal
institution.
and
he,
thereafter,
was
released
on
parole
from
the
federal
institution
and
i’m
not
sure
i
know
just
where
he
is
now
but
we
have
a
string
on
him
and
can
get
him
back
for
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
on
the
basis
of
the
role
which
this
court
has
laid
down
whereby
the
states
have
the
right
to
correct
their
errors
in
case.
and
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
of
course,
the
rule
is
that
the
court
makes
such
order
as
long
justice
require
and
it
does
not
require
that
there’d
be
an
absolute
discharge
of
the
defendant.
now,
at
that
time
as
i
say,
this
man
was
rather
summarily
revoked
on
the
strength
of
what
he
had
done
and
his
admission.
on
the
record,
there
is
no
question
that
he
made
the
admissions
to
the
state’s
attorney’s
office
in
the
county
of
illinois.
in
his
traverse,
he
admits,
he
made
the
admissions
to
the
attorney
to
the
assistant
states
attorney
but
he
takes
the
position
that
he
did
so
on
the
basis
of
some
statements
having
been
made
to
him
that
of
course,
the
wisconsin
authorities
would
never
be
informed
of
this
and
that
kleckner
had
been
killed
escaping
from
the
burglary
and
that
no
one
would
be
hurt
if
he
were
to
admit
his
part
and
that
he’d
be
let
out
on
low
bail
and
all
of
that
which
--
but
he
does
not,
in
any
way,
denied
that
he
made
the
statement,
the
complete
statement
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
in
this
case
and
you
already
will
see
that
it
contains
plenty
of
corroborate
of
detail
from
which
the
department
would
have
a
right
believe
that
it
was
true
and
correct.
however,
the
question
before
the
district
court
was
whether
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
if
so,
whether
he
was
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
and
at
that
time
we
asked
for
a
certiorari,
we
intended
to
raise
both
positions
here.
however,
the
morrissey
case
as
effectively
defeated
us
so
far
as
the
right
to
the
hearing
itself
is
concerned
because
i
cannot
distinguish
morrissey
from
this
case.
although
morrissey
involved
parole
and
this
one
involves
probation.
nevertheless,
the
two
are
in
law
indistinguishable
because
our
probationers
are
handled
exactly
the
same
as
parolees.
there
is
one
slight
exception
but
nothing
that
would
make
a
legal
distinction.
so,
i’m
here
now
only
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel.
however,
i
would
ask
this
court
if
you
can
do
so
to
clear
up
one
thing
for
us.
now,
as
i
mentioned
in
this
case,
this
man
was
permitted
to
go
to
illinois
under
the
interstate
compact.
we
have
over
600
people,
wisconsin
people
are
being
supervised
in
other
states.
nationwide,
there
are
at
least
25,000
people
who
are
being
supervised
parolees
and
probationers
being
supervised
in
other
states.
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
see
how
we
can
apply
strictly
the
morrissey
rules
to
these
out
of
state
supervised
cases.
in
the
first
place,
the
preliminary
hearing
which
is
mandated
by
morrissey
is
going
to
be
rather
difficult
to
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
speaking
of
the
interstate
compact
cases.
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
morrissey
rule
has
created
us
special
problems
with
reference
to
those
cases
and
of
course
to
any
case
where
the
probationer
or
parolee
has
absconded
and
where
his
violations
have
occurred
outside
of
the
state
in
which
he
was
on
probation
or
parole.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
i
don’t
know
that
we
have
any
right
to
ask
illinois
under
the
compact.
the
compact
does
not
provide
for
that,
the
compact
provides
only
for
illinois
to
supervise
our
people
and
to
report
to
us
on
what
they’ve
been
doing.
it
does
not
provide
for
them
to
hold
hearings.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well
actually
i
suppose
both
parts,
both
the
preliminary
and
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
a.
platz
preliminary
probable
cause,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
platz
no
that’s
true.
it
does
not
require
a
hearing
before
he
can
be
held
in
custody
at
that
point.
mr.
william
a.
platz
absconds.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
what
we
would
have
to
do
therein
would
be
to
issue
a
parole
revocation
of
warrant,
charging
him
with
having
absconded
and
find
out
whether
he
will
waive
extradition.
if
will
not
waive
extradition
we
have
extract
it.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
is
true
except
for
only
for
the
fact
that
if
you
let
us
bring
him
back.
the
only
problem
is
that
under
morrissey,
we
then
have
to
hold
--
have
to
hold
a
hearing,
after
we
get
him
back
here
and
what
it
was
that
he
did
and
in
illinois
or
wherever
he
was
being
supervised.
and
we
may
have
to
produce
the
witnesses.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
they
only
showing
that
we
have
to
make
for
extradition
is
the
fact
that
he
has
been
charged
and
convicted
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
a.
platz
not
for
extradition,
no.
mr.
william
a.
platz
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
then
i
believe,
we
would
be
permitted
having
return
the
man
to
wisconsin
in
the
extradition
situation
to
use
just
statements
that
we
would
have
obtained
from
the
state
where
the
violation
occurred,
is
that
right?
mr.
william
a.
platz
for
the
purpose
of
determining
probable
cause
to
hold
him
for
violation
of
his
probational
parole.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that’s
right.
but
if
that’s
the
case
--
but
then
we
still
are
confronted
with
the
necessity
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
william
a.
platz
for
final
action
at
which
we
may
have
to
produce
the
witnesses
who
are
in
a
position
to
testify
that
what
he
was
did
in
that
out
of
state.
now
this
maybe
either
in
a
case
where
you
supervise
outside
of
the
state
to
put
him
on
probation
or
parole
or
maybe
in
a
situation
where
he
has
absconded
from
that
state
and
gone
to
another
state
where
he
got
into
some
further
trouble,
which
did
not
however
wind
up
with
the
conviction
of
crime.
if
it
wound
up
with
the
conviction
of
crime,
i
assume
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
under
the
morrissey
rule
to
re-litigate
that.
we
will
just
establish
that
by
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes.
mr.
william
a.
platz
and
in
scarpelli’s
case
we
had
his
confession
which
probably
would
have
had
to
be
proved
by
inducing
one
of
the
witnesses
to
the
confession
from
the
wisconsin
and
testify
about
it,
i
suppose.
had
the
rule
been
enforced
at
the
time
when
scarpelli
violated.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
if
we
can
do
it
in
interrogatories,
that
would
be
very
helpful
of
course
because--
mr.
william
a.
platz
we
have
no
process
whereby
we
could
get
the
witness
to
wisconsin
from
illinois
for
example.
assuming
he’s
unwilling
to
come.
illinois
is
close
of
course
but
we’ve
got
people
at
much
greater
distances
than
that.
mr.
william
a.
platz
i
think
just
about
all
of
them
right
now,
and
two
in
puerto
rico
and
virgin
islands,
district
of
columbia.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
maybe
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
council
of
state
governments
is
working
on
it
and
has
proposed
the
bill
which
i
have
examined
and
i
don’t
think
much
of
it
because
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
insufficient
for
that
purpose
and
i
have
so
notified
the
counsel.
i
hope
they
can
work
out
something
better
than
they
already
have.
but
so
far
at
least,
it’s
more
or
less
on
our
resources
to
comply
with
morrissey
in
the
interstate
cases.
now,
coming
to
the
question
of
counsel
and
particularly
if
we
have
to
have
a
counsel
for
the
preliminary
and
if
that
counsel
--
if
the
preliminary
is
to
be
held
in
the
other
state
and
if
counsel
has
to
be
appointed
at
public
expense,
this
is
one
that
cause
all
kinds
of
problems.
if
the
counsel
has
to
be
appointed
in
a
foreign
state
to
represent
a
man
who
is
not
really
there
by
at
all.
mr.
william
a.
platz
at
the
probable
cause
hearing,
yes.
if
there
has
to
be
counsel
at
the
probable
cause
hearing.
now,
i’d
like
to
drop
that
and
go
on
to
the
question
of
counsel
at
the
final
hearing.
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes,
except
that
in
our
situation
the
parole
board
doesn’t
hear
it
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
platz
we
have
had
to
retain
the
hearing
examiners
for
that
purpose.
we
have
had
one
for
the
last
two
years
and
have
now
added
another
one.
mr.
william
a.
platz
we,
at
that
stage
hold
a
hearing
at
which
evidence
is
taken
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
violation
wants
a
revocation.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
all
of
the
rules
of
the
--
not
the
rules
of
evidence
applicable
in
court.
mr.
william
a.
platz
and
i
think,
they
admit
anything
as
that’s
considered
to
be
irrelevant
in
probative.
mr.
william
a.
platz
this
would
all
be
received.
however,
we
understand
under
morrissey
that
if
the
probationer
or
parolee
says
he
wants
to
be
confronted
with
the
people
who
have
given
information
against
him
then
he
has
to
be
confronted
with
--
unless,
the
hearing
examiner
determines
that
to
do
so
would
be
dangerous,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
that
question
really
has
come
up.
mr.
william
a.
platz
no
that’s
right
and
we
don’t
apply
any
such
a
burden
either.
mr.
william
a.
platz
no
sir
we
do
not.
we
consider
that
the
question
is
whether
that
the
bureau
of
probation
and
parole
in
recommending
revocation
has
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
and
if
not,
then
whether
the
violation
which
has
been
established
is
gone
for
--
actually
justifies
the
warrants
the
revocation.
now,
on
that
point
of
course
we
run
into
another
side
issue
and
that
is
what
else
can
we
consider
besides
this
particular
violation?
in
the
case
of
a
judge
who
is
about
to
sentence
a
man,
he
looks
at
more
than
just
the
crime
that
the
man
has
been
convicted
of,
he
looks
at
a
whole
lot
of
things.
he
gets,
in
many
instances,
he
gets
a
pre-sentence
investigation
which
is
made
by
some
of
these
very
same
people
who
were
talking
about
here,
these
probation
and
parole
agents.
mr.
william
a.
platz
sir.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
the
practice
has
been
that
--
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
say
this,
that
the
parole
agent
who
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
man’s
background
makes
the
initial
determination
of
whether
he
is
going
to
recommend
probation
revocation
or
parole
revocation.
mr.
william
a.
platz
sir?
mr.
william
a.
platz
he
may
rely
on
the
great
many
things,
that
is
right.
and
uncertainly,
these
files
contain
a
great
deal
of
the
man’s
history
and
matters
which
are
officially
known
to
the
department
and
known
particularly
to
the
bureau
of
probation
and
parole
which
is
a
part
of
the
department.
and
these
things
are
all
known
not
only
personally
but
on
the
record
of
the
department.
mr.
william
a.
platz
as
accepted,
i
again
i
mention
it’s
not
the
parole
board.
the
parole
board
grants
parole
in
wisconsin,
it
does
not
revoke.
revocation
is
initiated
by
the
bureau
of
probation
and
parole
which
is
a
separate
organization.
it’s
the
organization
within
the
department
which
supervises
the
probationers
and
parolees
and
which
initiates
the
revocations.
the
revocations
actually,
the
signature
on
the
paper
which
makes
the
revocation
final
and
gives
it
effect
is
that
of
the
secretary
of
the
department.
and
he
acts,
of
course,
upon
the
advice
of
his
people
who
are
employed
for
that
purpose.
starting
with
the
bureau
of
probation
and
parole
then
now
of
course
it
has
to
go
to
the
examiner
and
the
examiner
then
reports
to
the
assistant
secretary
who
reports
to
the
secretary.
mr.
william
a.
platz
what
guidelines?
well,
they
are
in
writing,
i
don’t
have.
sorry,
i’m
not
able
to
give
them
to
you
verbatim
on
what
they
are.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
they
do
have
guidelines.
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes,
i
would
say
i
would
have
to
admit
they’re
pretty
loose.
so
they
have
to
--
in
other
words,
the
agent
has
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
what
he
knows
about
this
man,
whether
the
time
has
come
when
the
man
has
to
be
taken
off
the
parole.
mr.
william
a.
platz
if
he
talked
back
to
him?
i
don’t
think
so.
but
what
maybe
(voice
overlap)
are
not
sufficient.
for
example,
a
man
maybe
convicted
of
another
crime.
in
many
instances,
this
would
result
in
a
revocation
and
maybe
it
will
not
result
in
the
revocation.
mr.
william
a.
platz
there
are
some,
yes.
surely.
mr.
william
a.
platz
i
wouldn’t
say
there
are
none.
no,
i
can’t
say
that
but
neither
can
i
give
you
what
they
are.
i’m
not
that
deep
enough
in
to
it
and
this
record
of
course
doesn’t
--
going
to
that
here
--
here
was
a
case
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
is
right
but
i
would
say
that
the
type
of
thing
that
he
considers
is
probably
very
much
the
same.
but
what
i’m
concerned
about
is
does
all
this
have
to
be
proved
that
the
hearing
or
can
we
take
into
account
these
facts
which
are
known
--
(voice
overlap)
department.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
could
be
an
example.
yes,
that
sort
of
thing.
in
other
words,
the
whole
record
this
man
has
made
over
the
period
of
his
supervision.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
it’s
in
the
same
nature.
it's
that
same
sort
of
thing.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that’s
what
it
is
in
court,
your
honor
and
that’s
what
this
court
said
it
was
alright
way
back
in
williams
against
new
york.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that’s
what
i
--
that’s
what
i’m
asking
this
court.
is
it
tenable
or
isn’t
it?
and
if
it
isn’t,
why
isn’t
that
if
a
court
can
act
on
that
kind
of
information,
then
why
can’t
the
department
which
compiles
the
information
which
is
considered
good
enough
for
court
to
act
unlike
in
the
department
acted?
mr.
william
a.
platz
no,
it
didn’t.
it
did
not,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
a.
platz
no,
it
did
not.
it
did
not.
but
it
did
say
that
one
of
the
questions
that
has
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
hearing
is
whether
the
violation
is
sufficiently
serious
to
justify
a
revocation
and
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
is
true.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
morrissey
requires
confrontation
if
demanded
by
the
defendant
or
by
the
probation
or
parolee,
unless
the
examiner
finds
that
to
require
confrontation
will
be
dangerous.
i’m
sorry,
i’m
not
able
to
go
any
further
to
what
i
--
but
i
hope
i’ve
got
it
all
covered
in
my
brief.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
platz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
a.
platz
i
might
mentioned
that
my
client
pronounces
his
name
in
a
french
way,
it’s
gagnon.
mr.
william
a.
platz
this
case
commenced
actually
on
july
9,
1965
when
gerald
scarpelli
was
convicted
in
wisconsin
of
armed
robbery
in
the
same
county
and
was
placed
on
probation
for
a
period
of
seven
years
in
the
custody
of
what
was
then
the
state
department
of
public
welfare
which
has
control
of
all
probationers
and
parolees
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
he
was
also
at
the
same
time
sentenced
to
a
term
of
15
years
in
the
wisconsin
state
prison
and
that
execution
of
the
sentence
was
stayed
pending
the
seven
years
probation.
he
was
permitted
to
leave
the
state
of
wisconsin
pursuant
to
the
interstate
compact
for
out
of
state
parolee
supervision
and
go
to
the
state
of
illinois
where
he
resided.
his
residence
was
in
a
suburb
of
chicago
and
he
was
employed
in
another
suburb
of
chicago.
he
was
accepted
for
supervision
by
the
cook
county
probation
department
pursuant
to
the
interstate
compact
on
august
5th,
1965.
and
on
friday
august
6th,
the
following
day,
a
home
in
deerfield,
illinois
which
is
a
northern
suburb
of
chicago
and
is
quite
some
distance
north
from
scarpelli’s
residence
and
from
his
place
of
employment
was
burglarized
during
the
day
time
in
the
morning
and
news
of
this
came
to
the
department
of
public
welfare
which
saw
a
news
article
in
the
chicago
tribune
which
contained
two
photographs
including
one
of
our
probationer
scarpelli
and
also
a
statement
which
he
gave
to
the
assistant
state’s
attorney
of
lake
county,
illinois
in
which
he
made
a
full
confession
of
his
part
in
the
burglary.
the
co-defendant
or
the
other
burglar
was
also
his
co-defendant
in
the
wisconsin
robbery
of
which
he
had
been
previously
convicted.
i
think
fred
kleckner,
the
other
robber,
the
other
burglar
in
illinois
was
not
at
that
time
convicted
in
wisconsin.
kleckner
was
shot
leaving
the
burglar
premises
and
scarpelli
however
escaped
and
was
not
taken
in
the
custody
for
some
little
time.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
is
what
i’m
describing
now,
the
conduct
which
led
to
the
revocation.
now,
at
that
time
in
wisconsin,
the
law
was
that
there
was
no
right
to
a
hearing
on
revocation
of
probation.
our
law
on
probation
was
enacted
in
1909,
two
years
after
our
parole
law.
the
parole
law
had
placed
parolees
in
the
custody
of
the
old
board
of
control
which
later
became
the
department
of
public
welfare
and
two
years
later
in
1909,
the
legislature
enacted
the
probation
law
under
which
the
courts
could
either
impose
sentence
and
stay
execution
thereof
and
place
them
on
probation
under
the
custody
and
control
of
the
same
department
which
had
control
of
parolees
and
under
the
same
rules
and
regulations
or
could
withhold
sentence
all
together
and
place
them
on
probation.
in
the
case
of
scarpelli,
it
was
the
case
of
the
sentence
being
imposed
and
execution
staid.
now,
originally
in
wisconsin,
the
probation
law
required
that
before
probation
be
revoked,
there
be
a
hearing.
the
law
said
a
personal
hearing,
a
full
investigation
and
personal
hearing.
in
1947,
that
provision
was
removed
in
the
course
of
the
revision
of
the
statute
and
there
had
been
no
hearing
since
then.
this
court
in
escoe
v.
zerbst
did
held
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing
on
revocation
or
probation.
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes,
your
honor.
and
since
before
that
too
but
what
i
mean
is
up
until
the
time
of
this
case,
there
had
been
no
action.
now,
this
case
was
commenced
in
the
federal
court
in
december
of
1968
which
was
over
three
years
after
the
revocation.
and
it
took
quite
a
while
it
was
1970
before
it
was
decided
in
the
court,
in
the
district
court.
we
lost
in
the
district
court.
we
appealed
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
we
lost
there
it
took
about
almost
a
year
for
that
to
be
decided
and
we
applied
for
certiorari
in
this
court
which
was
granted
at
the
end
of
june.
counsel
now
takes
the
position
that
the
case
has
become
moot
because
the
original
seven
years
of
probation,
counter
years
has
expired,
i
have
filed
a
reply
a
brief
and
answering
this
claim
of
mootness
and
in
order
to
have
more
time
to
discuss
the
merits,
i
really
preferred
to
leave
the
mootness
to
my
reply
brief.
i
consider
that
the
case
is
not
moot,
that
we
have
a
right,
if
we
have
committed
constitutionally,
we
have
a
right
to
correct
it
and
to
correct
it
now
even
though
the
original
seven
counter
years
have
expired.
actually
at
the
time
this
matter
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
probationer
scarpelli
had
been
released
on
parole
to
meet
a
federal
charge
and
had
already
been
tried
federally
and
was
then
in
(inaudible)
in
the
federal
institution.
and
he,
thereafter,
was
released
on
parole
from
the
federal
institution
and
i’m
not
sure
i
know
just
where
he
is
now
but
we
have
a
string
on
him
and
can
get
him
back
for
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
on
the
basis
of
the
role
which
this
court
has
laid
down
whereby
the
states
have
the
right
to
correct
their
errors
in
case.
and
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
of
course,
the
rule
is
that
the
court
makes
such
order
as
long
justice
require
and
it
does
not
require
that
there’d
be
an
absolute
discharge
of
the
defendant.
now,
at
that
time
as
i
say,
this
man
was
rather
summarily
revoked
on
the
strength
of
what
he
had
done
and
his
admission.
on
the
record,
there
is
no
question
that
he
made
the
admissions
to
the
state’s
attorney’s
office
in
the
county
of
illinois.
in
his
traverse,
he
admits,
he
made
the
admissions
to
the
attorney
to
the
assistant
states
attorney
but
he
takes
the
position
that
he
did
so
on
the
basis
of
some
statements
having
been
made
to
him
that
of
course,
the
wisconsin
authorities
would
never
be
informed
of
this
and
that
kleckner
had
been
killed
escaping
from
the
burglary
and
that
no
one
would
be
hurt
if
he
were
to
admit
his
part
and
that
he’d
be
let
out
on
low
bail
and
all
of
that
which
--
but
he
does
not,
in
any
way,
denied
that
he
made
the
statement,
the
complete
statement
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
in
this
case
and
you
already
will
see
that
it
contains
plenty
of
corroborate
of
detail
from
which
the
department
would
have
a
right
believe
that
it
was
true
and
correct.
however,
the
question
before
the
district
court
was
whether
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
if
so,
whether
he
was
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
and
at
that
time
we
asked
for
a
certiorari,
we
intended
to
raise
both
positions
here.
however,
the
morrissey
case
as
effectively
defeated
us
so
far
as
the
right
to
the
hearing
itself
is
concerned
because
i
cannot
distinguish
morrissey
from
this
case.
although
morrissey
involved
parole
and
this
one
involves
probation.
nevertheless,
the
two
are
in
law
indistinguishable
because
our
probationers
are
handled
exactly
the
same
as
parolees.
there
is
one
slight
exception
but
nothing
that
would
make
a
legal
distinction.
so,
i’m
here
now
only
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel.
however,
i
would
ask
this
court
if
you
can
do
so
to
clear
up
one
thing
for
us.
now,
as
i
mentioned
in
this
case,
this
man
was
permitted
to
go
to
illinois
under
the
interstate
compact.
we
have
over
600
people,
wisconsin
people
are
being
supervised
in
other
states.
nationwide,
there
are
at
least
25,000
people
who
are
being
supervised
parolees
and
probationers
being
supervised
in
other
states.
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
see
how
we
can
apply
strictly
the
morrissey
rules
to
these
out
of
state
supervised
cases.
in
the
first
place,
the
preliminary
hearing
which
is
mandated
by
morrissey
is
going
to
be
rather
difficult
to
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
speaking
of
the
interstate
compact
cases.
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
morrissey
rule
has
created
us
special
problems
with
reference
to
those
cases
and
of
course
to
any
case
where
the
probationer
or
parolee
has
absconded
and
where
his
violations
have
occurred
outside
of
the
state
in
which
he
was
on
probation
or
parole.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
i
don’t
know
that
we
have
any
right
to
ask
illinois
under
the
compact.
the
compact
does
not
provide
for
that,
the
compact
provides
only
for
illinois
to
supervise
our
people
and
to
report
to
us
on
what
they’ve
been
doing.
it
does
not
provide
for
them
to
hold
hearings.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well
actually
i
suppose
both
parts,
both
the
preliminary
and
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
a.
platz
preliminary
probable
cause,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
platz
no
that’s
true.
it
does
not
require
a
hearing
before
he
can
be
held
in
custody
at
that
point.
mr.
william
a.
platz
absconds.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
what
we
would
have
to
do
therein
would
be
to
issue
a
parole
revocation
of
warrant,
charging
him
with
having
absconded
and
find
out
whether
he
will
waive
extradition.
if
will
not
waive
extradition
we
have
extract
it.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
is
true
except
for
only
for
the
fact
that
if
you
let
us
bring
him
back.
the
only
problem
is
that
under
morrissey,
we
then
have
to
hold
--
have
to
hold
a
hearing,
after
we
get
him
back
here
and
what
it
was
that
he
did
and
in
illinois
or
wherever
he
was
being
supervised.
and
we
may
have
to
produce
the
witnesses.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
they
only
showing
that
we
have
to
make
for
extradition
is
the
fact
that
he
has
been
charged
and
convicted
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
a.
platz
not
for
extradition,
no.
mr.
william
a.
platz
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
then
i
believe,
we
would
be
permitted
having
return
the
man
to
wisconsin
in
the
extradition
situation
to
use
just
statements
that
we
would
have
obtained
from
the
state
where
the
violation
occurred,
is
that
right?
mr.
william
a.
platz
for
the
purpose
of
determining
probable
cause
to
hold
him
for
violation
of
his
probational
parole.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that’s
right.
but
if
that’s
the
case
--
but
then
we
still
are
confronted
with
the
necessity
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
william
a.
platz
for
final
action
at
which
we
may
have
to
produce
the
witnesses
who
are
in
a
position
to
testify
that
what
he
was
did
in
that
out
of
state.
now
this
maybe
either
in
a
case
where
you
supervise
outside
of
the
state
to
put
him
on
probation
or
parole
or
maybe
in
a
situation
where
he
has
absconded
from
that
state
and
gone
to
another
state
where
he
got
into
some
further
trouble,
which
did
not
however
wind
up
with
the
conviction
of
crime.
if
it
wound
up
with
the
conviction
of
crime,
i
assume
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
under
the
morrissey
rule
to
re-litigate
that.
we
will
just
establish
that
by
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes.
mr.
william
a.
platz
and
in
scarpelli’s
case
we
had
his
confession
which
probably
would
have
had
to
be
proved
by
inducing
one
of
the
witnesses
to
the
confession
from
the
wisconsin
and
testify
about
it,
i
suppose.
had
the
rule
been
enforced
at
the
time
when
scarpelli
violated.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
if
we
can
do
it
in
interrogatories,
that
would
be
very
helpful
of
course
because--
mr.
william
a.
platz
we
have
no
process
whereby
we
could
get
the
witness
to
wisconsin
from
illinois
for
example.
assuming
he’s
unwilling
to
come.
illinois
is
close
of
course
but
we’ve
got
people
at
much
greater
distances
than
that.
mr.
william
a.
platz
i
think
just
about
all
of
them
right
now,
and
two
in
puerto
rico
and
virgin
islands,
district
of
columbia.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
maybe
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
council
of
state
governments
is
working
on
it
and
has
proposed
the
bill
which
i
have
examined
and
i
don’t
think
much
of
it
because
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
insufficient
for
that
purpose
and
i
have
so
notified
the
counsel.
i
hope
they
can
work
out
something
better
than
they
already
have.
but
so
far
at
least,
it’s
more
or
less
on
our
resources
to
comply
with
morrissey
in
the
interstate
cases.
now,
coming
to
the
question
of
counsel
and
particularly
if
we
have
to
have
a
counsel
for
the
preliminary
and
if
that
counsel
--
if
the
preliminary
is
to
be
held
in
the
other
state
and
if
counsel
has
to
be
appointed
at
public
expense,
this
is
one
that
cause
all
kinds
of
problems.
if
the
counsel
has
to
be
appointed
in
a
foreign
state
to
represent
a
man
who
is
not
really
there
by
at
all.
mr.
william
a.
platz
at
the
probable
cause
hearing,
yes.
if
there
has
to
be
counsel
at
the
probable
cause
hearing.
now,
i’d
like
to
drop
that
and
go
on
to
the
question
of
counsel
at
the
final
hearing.
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes,
except
that
in
our
situation
the
parole
board
doesn’t
hear
it
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
platz
we
have
had
to
retain
the
hearing
examiners
for
that
purpose.
we
have
had
one
for
the
last
two
years
and
have
now
added
another
one.
mr.
william
a.
platz
we,
at
that
stage
hold
a
hearing
at
which
evidence
is
taken
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
violation
wants
a
revocation.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
all
of
the
rules
of
the
--
not
the
rules
of
evidence
applicable
in
court.
mr.
william
a.
platz
and
i
think,
they
admit
anything
as
that’s
considered
to
be
irrelevant
in
probative.
mr.
william
a.
platz
this
would
all
be
received.
however,
we
understand
under
morrissey
that
if
the
probationer
or
parolee
says
he
wants
to
be
confronted
with
the
people
who
have
given
information
against
him
then
he
has
to
be
confronted
with
--
unless,
the
hearing
examiner
determines
that
to
do
so
would
be
dangerous,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
that
question
really
has
come
up.
mr.
william
a.
platz
no
that’s
right
and
we
don’t
apply
any
such
a
burden
either.
mr.
william
a.
platz
no
sir
we
do
not.
we
consider
that
the
question
is
whether
that
the
bureau
of
probation
and
parole
in
recommending
revocation
has
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
and
if
not,
then
whether
the
violation
which
has
been
established
is
gone
for
--
actually
justifies
the
warrants
the
revocation.
now,
on
that
point
of
course
we
run
into
another
side
issue
and
that
is
what
else
can
we
consider
besides
this
particular
violation?
in
the
case
of
a
judge
who
is
about
to
sentence
a
man,
he
looks
at
more
than
just
the
crime
that
the
man
has
been
convicted
of,
he
looks
at
a
whole
lot
of
things.
he
gets,
in
many
instances,
he
gets
a
pre-sentence
investigation
which
is
made
by
some
of
these
very
same
people
who
were
talking
about
here,
these
probation
and
parole
agents.
mr.
william
a.
platz
sir.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
the
practice
has
been
that
--
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
say
this,
that
the
parole
agent
who
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
man’s
background
makes
the
initial
determination
of
whether
he
is
going
to
recommend
probation
revocation
or
parole
revocation.
mr.
william
a.
platz
sir?
mr.
william
a.
platz
he
may
rely
on
the
great
many
things,
that
is
right.
and
uncertainly,
these
files
contain
a
great
deal
of
the
man’s
history
and
matters
which
are
officially
known
to
the
department
and
known
particularly
to
the
bureau
of
probation
and
parole
which
is
a
part
of
the
department.
and
these
things
are
all
known
not
only
personally
but
on
the
record
of
the
department.
mr.
william
a.
platz
as
accepted,
i
again
i
mention
it’s
not
the
parole
board.
the
parole
board
grants
parole
in
wisconsin,
it
does
not
revoke.
revocation
is
initiated
by
the
bureau
of
probation
and
parole
which
is
a
separate
organization.
it’s
the
organization
within
the
department
which
supervises
the
probationers
and
parolees
and
which
initiates
the
revocations.
the
revocations
actually,
the
signature
on
the
paper
which
makes
the
revocation
final
and
gives
it
effect
is
that
of
the
secretary
of
the
department.
and
he
acts,
of
course,
upon
the
advice
of
his
people
who
are
employed
for
that
purpose.
starting
with
the
bureau
of
probation
and
parole
then
now
of
course
it
has
to
go
to
the
examiner
and
the
examiner
then
reports
to
the
assistant
secretary
who
reports
to
the
secretary.
mr.
william
a.
platz
what
guidelines?
well,
they
are
in
writing,
i
don’t
have.
sorry,
i’m
not
able
to
give
them
to
you
verbatim
on
what
they
are.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
they
do
have
guidelines.
mr.
william
a.
platz
yes,
i
would
say
i
would
have
to
admit
they’re
pretty
loose.
so
they
have
to
--
in
other
words,
the
agent
has
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
what
he
knows
about
this
man,
whether
the
time
has
come
when
the
man
has
to
be
taken
off
the
parole.
mr.
william
a.
platz
if
he
talked
back
to
him?
i
don’t
think
so.
but
what
maybe
(voice
overlap)
are
not
sufficient.
for
example,
a
man
maybe
convicted
of
another
crime.
in
many
instances,
this
would
result
in
a
revocation
and
maybe
it
will
not
result
in
the
revocation.
mr.
william
a.
platz
there
are
some,
yes.
surely.
mr.
william
a.
platz
i
wouldn’t
say
there
are
none.
no,
i
can’t
say
that
but
neither
can
i
give
you
what
they
are.
i’m
not
that
deep
enough
in
to
it
and
this
record
of
course
doesn’t
--
going
to
that
here
--
here
was
a
case
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
is
right
but
i
would
say
that
the
type
of
thing
that
he
considers
is
probably
very
much
the
same.
but
what
i’m
concerned
about
is
does
all
this
have
to
be
proved
that
the
hearing
or
can
we
take
into
account
these
facts
which
are
known
--
(voice
overlap)
department.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
could
be
an
example.
yes,
that
sort
of
thing.
in
other
words,
the
whole
record
this
man
has
made
over
the
period
of
his
supervision.
mr.
william
a.
platz
well,
it’s
in
the
same
nature.
it's
that
same
sort
of
thing.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that’s
what
it
is
in
court,
your
honor
and
that’s
what
this
court
said
it
was
alright
way
back
in
williams
against
new
york.
mr.
william
a.
platz
that’s
what
i
--
that’s
what
i’m
asking
this
court.
is
it
tenable
or
isn’t
it?
and
if
it
isn’t,
why
isn’t
that
if
a
court
can
act
on
that
kind
of
information,
then
why
can’t
the
department
which
compiles
the
information
which
is
considered
good
enough
for
court
to
act
unlike
in
the
department
acted?
mr.
william
a.
platz
no,
it
didn’t.
it
did
not,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
a.
platz
no,
it
did
not.
it
did
not.
but
it
did
say
that
one
of
the
questions
that
has
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
hearing
is
whether
the
violation
is
sufficiently
serious
to
justify
a
revocation
and
--
mr.
william
a.
platz
that
is
true.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
morrissey
requires
confrontation
if
demanded
by
the
defendant
or
by
the
probation
or
parolee,
unless
the
examiner
finds
that
to
require
confrontation
will
be
dangerous.
i’m
sorry,
i’m
not
able
to
go
any
further
to
what
i
--
but
i
hope
i’ve
got
it
all
covered
in
my
brief.
thank
you.
