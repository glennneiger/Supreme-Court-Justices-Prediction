justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
told
us
that
in
the
sequence
of
i,
thought
you
said
of
the
supreme
court
cases
in
the
wisconsin,
there
was
a
stage
where
they
said
there
was
no
requirement
to
appoint
counsel
at
one
stage.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
only
after
another
seventh
circuit
case,
this
one
came
along
that
they
then
said
alright
then
now
we
must
have
right
to
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
mr.
platz
suggested
earlier
though
there
have
been
instances
in
wisconsin
where
a
subsequent
conviction
didn’t
necessarily
was
out
of
the
revocation
of
parole?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
lawyers
--
you
don’t
think
appointed
lawyers
will
turn
these
proceedings
into
criminal
trials
or
make
them
as
close
to
--
them
as
possible?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know,
other
than
just
legal
argument
which
you’ve
presented
to
us,
are
there
some
empirical
considerations
that
you
might
advert
to?
are
there
sets
of
studies
made
that
indicate
that
probation
parole
revocations
are
particularly
unreliable
or
if
there
have
great
miscarriages
of
justice
or
is
it
this
just
a
deductive
approach
that
due
process
requires
hearings,
due
process
requires
lawyers
and
so
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
know
that
it’s
unreliable
unless
--
without
a
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
is
yes,
there
as
some
empirical
considerations
based
on
your
own
observations?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
lot
of
