mr.
william
m.
coffey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
very
briefly
like
to
first
address
myself
to
a
contention
of
the
respondent
that
this
matter
is
moot.
in
july
9,
1965,
gerald
scarpelli
on
his
plea
of
guilty
was
sentenced
to
15
years
in
state
penitentiary.
that
sentence
was
staid
and
he
was
placed
on
probation
for
seven
years.
that
probation
was
ultimately
revoked
by
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
department
of
public
health
and
social
services
in
september
of
1965.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
it
was
within
the
seven
years,
your
honor
but
scarpelli
then
filed
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
wisconsin
supreme
court
later
in
the
united
states
district
court
claiming
that
his
probation
was
illegally
revoked
and
that
he
had
not
been
granted
a
hearing
prior
to
the
revocation
of
that
probation.
the
united
states
district
court
held
scarpelli’s
claim
to
be
valid,
held
that
he
was
entitled
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
to
a
hearing
prior
to
any
revocation
of
his
probation.
he
also
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel
at
that
hearing.
the
state
of
wisconsin
appealed
that
decision
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
court
was
affirmed.
in
the
interim
period,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
also
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
scarpelli’s
probation
was
illegally
revoked
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
the
federal
constitution,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
they
did
not,
i
do
not
believe
there's
anything
in
wisconsin
opinion
or
wisconsin’s
supreme
court
opinion
that
you
can
interpret
as
saying
we
are
bound
by
the
decision
in
hahn
versus
burke
and
hahn
had
been
the
first
case
deciding,
he
had
a
right
to
have
a
hearing.
wisconsin
has
a
statute
that
says
that
anytime
you
place
a
man
on
probation,
during
that
term
of
probation,
you
may
modify
the
terms
and
conditions
of
probation
and
you
may
extend
the
period
of
probation
supervision.
now,
no
matter
how
this
court
resolves
the
right
to
counsel
issue,
scarpelli
is
entitled
or
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
prior
to
the
revocation
of
his
probation.
no
one
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
took
any
action
to
extend
scarpelli’s
probationary
period.
the
illegal
revocation
of
that
probation,
we
contend
cannot
operate
to
extend
that
period
of
the
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
i’m
not
your
honor.
i’m
just
talking
first
about
the
moot
decision.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
my
position
if
the
case
is
moot
and
as
a
result
that
the
illegal
revocation,
his
probation
may
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct,
your
honor
and
that
is
my
theory
that
we
could
go
back
to
wisconsin
that
would
be
my
position
that
they
can’t
hold
that
hearing.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct
and
so
that
i
can
go
back
to
wisconsin
now
and
argue
look,
you
have
from
seven
years
from
july
9th
of
1965
as
of
july
9,
1972,
the
seven
years
has
expired,
you
didn’t
extend
the
probationary
period,
you
can’t
--
you
no
longer
have
any
authority
or
control
over
this
man
to
give
him
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
which
your
honor?
mr.
william
m.
coffey
there
is
no
authority
whatsoever
in
the
law
since
state
of
wisconsin
to
extend
this
man’s
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
pardon
me?
mr.
william
m.
coffey
it’s
not
a
federal
law.
it’s
the
--
as
a
matter
of
the
operation
of
the
state
law,
his
probation
wasn’t
extended,
his
seven
years
are
up
and
therefore
that
no
one
has
extended
that
probationary
period
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
don’t
believe
that
the
statute
is
not
itself
executed.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
you
may
have
--
you
may
very
well
have
to.
i
right
really
say
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct
but
the
position
that
i
have
taken
is
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
not
here
contending
that
scarpelli
is
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
they’re
not
here
contending
that
hahn
v.
burke
which
was
decided
by
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
isn’t
the
law.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
pardon
me.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
morrissey
involved
parole.
hahn
v.
burke
which
is
out
of
the
seventh
circuit
involved
probation,
scarpelli
involves
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
scarpelli
is
out.
he
is
presently
out
i
believe
on
both
state
and
federal
parole.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
correct.
that
the
revocation
was
illegal
and
therefore
nothing
told
the
running
of
it.
the
seven
years
of
expired
and
in
the
question
moot.
i’ll
leave
the
mootness
question
for
a
moment,
let's
to
go
to
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
in
morrissey,
this
court
held
that
due
process
required
a
hearing
prior
to
revocation
of
parole.
the
court’s
decision
is
based
on
the
determination
or
the
finding
by
this
court
that
this
is
a
procedure
or
a
proceeding
where
an
individual,
if
he
loses
his
freedom
even
though
conditional
suffers
a
grievous
loss
and
therefore
due
process
applies
and
the
question
is
what
process
is
due.
in
morrissey,
the
court
recommends
and
suggests
that’s
constitutionally
mandated
for
a
parolee
that
the
procedure
include
a
written
notice,
a
disclosure
of
the
evidence
against
the
parolee,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
person.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
the
recital
of
the
conditions
is
alleged
to
violate
and
the
basis
of
the
issue.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i’m
sorry.
and
the
basis
on
which
you
claim
he
violated
the
conditions
of
his
parole.
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
to
present
witnesses,
documentary
evidence
and
right
to
confront
and
cross
examine
witnesses
with
the
exception
that
you
don’t
have
the
right
of
confrontation
if
there’s
a
determination
that
it’s
a
danger
to
the
witnesses.
then
he
is
entitled
to
the
neutral
and
detached
officer
and
he
is
also
entitled
to
written
statement
of
the
evidence
relied
on
in
the
reasons
for
revoking
the
parole.
now,
to
grant
that
right
to
parolees
and
to
recognize
that
a
parolee
is
entitled
constitutionally
to
that
kind
of
a
hearing
suggests
there
is
no
real
distinction
or
difference
between
probationers
and
parolees.
and
in
fact,
with
a
parolee,
you
are
dealing
with
someone
that
has
been
in
the
institution,
who
has
served
the
sentence
and
who
has
–
it
is
just
the
questions
as
whether
he
is
going
to
be
returned.
with
the
probationer,
you
are
dealing
with
a
person
who
has
never
been
in
the
institution.
and
in
wisconsin,
that
the
judicial
determination
made
at
the
time
someone
is
placed
on
probation
is
that
the
person
is
not
likely
again
to
commit
crime
and
he
is
not
a
threat
to
the
community
and
therefore
he
should
not
suffer
the
penalty
of
incarceration.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
well,
at
least
at
the
moment
probation
is
granted
that’s
the
determination
that
is
made.
subsequent
events
may
prove
that
to
be
erroneous
and
subsequent
events
proved
many
things
erroneous.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
believe
that
would
be
accurate,
yes.
and
then
this
is
an
individual
who
has
never
been
put
in
the
penal
institution.
so
i
believe
that
all
of
the
reasoning
and
all
of
the
rationale
with
morrissey
and
parolees
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
probationer
and
that
the
same
hearing
requirements
should
be
required
in
terms
of
the
probationer
as
in
the
parolee.
the
question
in
this
case
is
if
morrissey
is
extended
to
probation
revocation
proceedings
and
the
same
type
of
hearing
as
is
set
forth
in
morrissey
is
required
in
the
probation
revocation
proceedings,
does
that
mean
also
that
the
individual
is
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel?
he
is
a
counsel
of
his
own
choosing,
a
retained
counsel
that
is
court
appointed
counsel,
so
i
think
then
the
basis
of
some
decisions
goldberg
versus
kelly
and
the
like
of
this
court,
there
could
be
an
argument
made
that
the
person
that’s
in
the
position
to
retain
his
own,
his
own
attorney
under
the
precedence
of
this
court
is
clearly
entitled
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel
and
the
only
really
open
question
is
whether
the
indigent
is
entitled
to
be
represented
by
appointed
counsel.
i
wouldn’t
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
they
do
your
honor.
it’s
interesting
that
scarpelli
arises
in
to
a
racine
county
for
five
or
six
years
prior
to
hahn
versus
burke
or
any
of
these
cases.
the
state
of
wisconsin,
milwaukee
county
which
is
the
most
populous
county
in
the
state
by
a
large
number
is
a
city
of
the
first
class.
in
milwaukee
county
for
five
or
six
years
prior
to
1970,
probation
violators
were
given
a
hearing
and
a
lawyer.
the
only
places,
you
didn’t
get
a
hearing
and
a
lawyer
were
in
counties
outside
of
milwaukee
county
and
so
that
however
since
these
cases,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
decided
that
both
probationers
and
parolees
are
entitled
to
hearings
and
they
also
have
decided
that
they
are
entitled
to
be
represented
by
lawyers,
that
they
are
entitled
to
be
represented
by
court
appointed
lawyers
if
they
cannot
afford
to
hire
their
own.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
it
is
your
honor.
it’s
almost
word
for
word.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
under
the
due
process
clause,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
well
what
happened
--
what
happened
is
this
kind
of
law
involved
procedure.
hahn
versus
burke
was
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
you
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
in
a
probation
revocation
case.
after
hahn
v.
burke,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decided
state
ex
rel.
johnson
v.
cady
and
said
that
probationers
and
parolees
were
entitled
to
hearings
prior
to
the
revocation
--
but
they
were
not
entitled
to
court
appointed
counsel.
then,
scarpelli
was
decided
by
united
states
district
court
and
then
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
then
the
united
states
--
then
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decided
state
ex
rel
bernal
to
be
someone
that
was
involved.
the
juvenile
said,
he
had
to
have
a
right
--
he
had
a
right
to
be
represented
by
a
lawyer
at
his
probation
revocation
proceeding
and
they
later
decided
state
the
all
strike
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
also
held
that
an
adult
was
entitled
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
that’s
the
one
situation
where
it
probably
could
be
a
valid
distinction
between
a
hearing
and
a
right
to
award
because
it’s
pretty
irrefutable
if
you
have
amended
some
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
you
could
draw
that
distinction.
i
have
some
problems
with
it.
i
think
my
own
view
would
be
that
it’s
much
simpler
to
say
that
he
has
the
right
to
have
a
hearing
and
he
has
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
because
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
what
they
say.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
they
have
not.
if
the
united
states
district
court
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
well,
the
wisconsin,
i
assume
that
if
this
court
rejects
the
argument
that
counsel
is
required
at
probation
or
parole
revocation
proceedings,
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
may
very
well
reevaluate
its
position.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
and
that
i
think
that
they
decided
purely
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitution.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct
justice.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
i
believe
or
i
think
it
more
appropriate
to
say
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
a
hearing
and
i
think
there
is
a
requirement
to
counsel
is
that
in
the
case
you
do
have
the
irrefutable
fact
of
a
subsequent
conviction,
lawyers
have
things
to
do
that
is
applying
being
many
lawyers
are
not
going
to
be
made
defendants
around
who
will
say,
“gee,
i
want
to
hear
you.”
before
you
can
revoke
my
probation
because
even
though
i
was
just
convicted
down
the
hall
of
a
subsequent
criminal
sentence.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
my
own
experience
--
they’re
not
in
the
position
to
parole.
mr.
platz
and
that
is
my
own
experience
would
be
that
the
subsequent
--
i
have
never
run
into
the
case
where
the
subsequent
conviction
of
another
crime
has
not
resulted
in
the
revocation
of
parole.
i
have
run
into
the
situation
where
the
subsequent
conviction
of
another
offense
has
not
resulted
in
the
revocation
of
probation
but
not
in
the
parole
but
i’m
not
in
the
position
to
say
that
that’s
not
the
case
that
may
well
happen
but
i
think
what’s
important
when
we
talk
about
these
hearings
and
when
we
say
we
are
going
to
set
up
these
procedures
and
afford
probationers,
the
rights
of
the
morrissey
hearing
is
we
have
to
recognize
that
their
right
is
really
meaningless
if
he
doesn’t
have
an
attorney.
these
people
are
in
jail.
first
of
all,
most
times
anyone
is
facing
a
probation
or
a
parole
revocation,
the
man
is
in
jail
and
so
say,
you
can
call
witnesses
and
you
can
produce
documentary
evidence
and
you
can
do
this
and
you
can
do
that.
this
is
a
man
that’s
confined.
he
can’t
do
anything.
he
gets
--
if
he’s
lucky
he
gets
one
phone
call
a
day
out
of
county
jail,
he
can
send
the
letter
and
hope
people
show
up,
but
he
has
no
way
of
effectively
communicating
with
anyone
in
terms
of
preparing
his
defense,
if
he
has
a
defense.
and
if
he
has
counsel,
counsel
is
able
to
do
that.
i
think
also
important
is
the
aba
recognizes
the
function
of
a
lawyer,
the
role
that
the
lawyer
can
play
and
the
aba
minimum
standards
for
criminal
justice,
the
standards
relating
to
probation.
american
bar
association
recommendation
is
that
there
are
people
facing
probation
revocation
being
provided
with
counsel.
and
they
state,
the
central
task
of
ascertaining
whether
the
prisoners
committed
the
ex-alleged
and
measuring
the
acts
proven
against
the
standard
to
which
he
was
obliged
to
conform
is
precisely
the
business
of
the
criminal
trial
itself
where
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
has
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
immutable
principles
of
justice.
indeed,
many
confess
revocation
proceedings,
the
conduct
charged
actually
constitutes
the
commission
of
a
criminal
act.
it
would
seem
patently
at
war
with
the
central
concept
of
procedural
justice
to
deny
to
a
person
his
liberty
at
stake,
the
opportunity
to
hear
and
meet
the
specific
charge
against
him
with
the
benefit
of
counsel.
in
this
case,
in
wisconsin
as
i’m
sure
in
most
other
places,
gerald
scarpelli
was
on
seven
years
probation.
gerald
scarpelli
could
have
done
six
years,
11
months
and
ten
days
on
probation
and
he
could
then
have
had
his
probation
revoked
at
a
15-year
sentence
executed,
and
he
would
have
received
no
credit
for
the
six
years,
11
months
and
whatever
number
of
days
it
was,
he
was
on
probation
because
it’s
dead
time.
when
a
man
is
facing
the
possible
loss
of
15
years
of
his
life
in
a
very
substantial
period
of
incarceration
in
a
penal
institution,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you’re
going
to
give
me
a
hearing
which
i
think
is
and
should
be
constitutionally
mandated
and
required
that
to
make
that
hearing
meaningful
and
to
have
form
and
not
just
to
have
form
but
to
have
substance
to
the
hearing.
there
has
to
be
a
counsel
involved.
i
think
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
chief
justice
burger’s
opinion
in
morrissey,
the
person
running
the
hearing
and
the
people
that
set
up
the
rules
and
the
procedures
can
see
to
it
that
the
hearing
is
conducted
to
only
issues
that
are
germane
and
relevant
to
the
determination
as
to
whether
probation
should
be
revoked.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
would
only
state
--
i
can
only
state
in
response,
chief
justice
that
yes
i
think
sure
there’s
a
possibility
of
that
if
the
persons
that
set
up
the
procedures
and
conduct
the
hearings
allow
them
to
become
too
cumbersome
and
to
too
much
like
a
criminal
trial.
yes,
but
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
need
for
that.
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
anyone
is
asking
for
or
requiring
and
i
think
also
in
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
white,
that
criminal
lawyers
will
do
what
they’re
permitted
to
do
and
if
you
have
a
hearing
examiner
or
you
have
a
procedure
adopted
in
a
particular
state
that
will
allow
the
criminal
lawyer
to
turn
it
into
criminal
trial,
he
may
very
well.
but
i
suggest,
that
i
think
morrissey
makes
it
clear
that
makes
it
clear
that
that’s
not
the
procedure
or
the
requirement
this
court
is
setting
up
and
that
it’s
the
obligation
or
the
duty
of
those
persons
that
are
setting
up
these
procedures
to
see
to
it
and
conduct
those
hearings
in
a
way
that
they
don’t
become
criminal
trials.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
your
honor
anytime
you
provide
legal
counsel
to
affecting
the
systems
to
counsel,
yes
it
satisfies
the
due
process
claim.
i
also
think
that
has
been
suggested
in
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
argersinger
and
probably
also
in
morrissey.
the
university
of
wisconsin
law
school,
if
a
clinical
program
set
up
that
walk
on
the
state
institution.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
would
have
no
--
i
personally
would
have
no
difficulty
with
trained
persons
other
than
lawyers
conducting
the
hearings
or
representing
the
defendants
as
long
as
someone
was
in
a
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
man
had
a
defense
or
anything
in
mitigation
of
the
violation
that’s
alleged
to.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
can’t
cite
the
court
to
any
study
as
such
but
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
defended
--
been
a
criminal
lawyer
for
some
eight
or
nine
years
now.
i’ve
been
in
a
lot
of
probation
revocation
proceedings.
i
would
hate
to
have
in
some
days
my
freedom
taken
away
from
and
some
of
the
basis
on
which
i
have
seen
people
go
to
jail.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
as
i
question
about
when
you
give
someone
a
standard
as
involved
in
scarperlli
association
with
known
criminal.
what
is
known
criminal?
in
wisconsin
up
until
two
or
three
months
ago,
traffic
offenses
were
criminal
offenses.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
he
was
not
shot
--
he
was
shot,
he
was
not
killed.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
that
was
scarpelli’s
claim
was
that
he
was
told
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
--
to
induce
the
confession
that
the
other
man
didn't
recover.
but
as
my
understanding
was
that
he
had
recovered.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
in
scarpelli’s
case,
fine.
maybe
you
have
what’s
known
as
known
criminal
but
i
--
you
know,
when
you
give
someone,
a
probation
officer,
a
standard
such
as
bad
--
don’t
associate
with
people
of
bad
character
etcetera,
i
mean
that’s
really
a
vague,
vague
standard
to
have
someone
making
a
determination
or
to
send
someone
to
prison.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
would
think
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
probably
as
many
as
answers
that
question
as
our
probation
parole
officers.
i
don’t
mean
to
stand
here
and
suggest
that
any
large
percentage
of
probation
parole
officers
are
in
a
hurry
to
put
people
back
in
institutions
but
probation
and
parole
officers
are
human.
they’re
subject
to
the
same
deficiencies
as
the
rest
of
us.
that
personal
--
personality
conflicts
and
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
read
that
in
the
material
that
mr.
platz
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
coffey
an
addendum
to
his
brief.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
but
i
don’t
find
this
probably
--
but
that’s
corrected
this
also.
i
don’t
know
how
anyone
arrived
at
that
conclusion.
yes,
i
would
think
that
probation
officer
probably
would
be
slightly
irritated
upon
the
return
of
someone
to
probation
and
going
to
the
institution.
i’m
not
sure
that
he
would
necessarily
take
it
as
a
failure
that
is
a
personal
failure.
he
may
very
well
take
it
as
being
a
someone
not
demonstrating
good
faith
with
him
and
cooperation
with
him
and
therefore
maybe
he
shouldn’t
be
as
helpful
and
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
they
are
chief
justice,
i
really
do.
i
think
they
have
a
great
deal
of
authority,
they
have
a
great
deal
power
and
they
don’t
have
a
lot
of
guidelines
and
standards
and
i
really
believe
and
i
really
feel
that
it’s
something
that
there
does
have
to
be
check
and
i
don’t
think
a
man’s
freedom
or
rights
should
really
depend
on
something
we
all
believed
to
be
and
hope
to
be
the
good
faith
and
the
good
intension
of
the
supervising
agent.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
in
the
probation
revocation
proceedings
that
occurred
in
milwaukee
county
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
new
procedures
mandated
by
morrissey,
the
hearings
were
in
court
in
milwaukee
county.
that
was
only
in
milwaukee
county.
there
were
departmental
decisions
outside
the
milwaukee
county.
but
in
milwaukee
county
the
hearing
was
in
court,
the
probation
officer
was
called
and
sworn
as
a
witness.
usually,
the
presiding
judge
asked
the
probation
officer,
the
questions
in
terms
of
do
you
have
a
report
to
make
but
the
district
attorney
was
present
and
the
defense
counsel
was
present
and
the
conclusion
of
the
agent’s
report
to
the
court,
counsel
for
both
of
the
district
attorney
officer
and
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
cross
examine
or
ask
questions
to
the
agent
and
then
the
court
made
its
determination.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
pardon
me?
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
very
briefly
like
to
first
address
myself
to
a
contention
of
the
respondent
that
this
matter
is
moot.
in
july
9,
1965,
gerald
scarpelli
on
his
plea
of
guilty
was
sentenced
to
15
years
in
state
penitentiary.
that
sentence
was
staid
and
he
was
placed
on
probation
for
seven
years.
that
probation
was
ultimately
revoked
by
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
department
of
public
health
and
social
services
in
september
of
1965.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
it
was
within
the
seven
years,
your
honor
but
scarpelli
then
filed
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
wisconsin
supreme
court
later
in
the
united
states
district
court
claiming
that
his
probation
was
illegally
revoked
and
that
he
had
not
been
granted
a
hearing
prior
to
the
revocation
of
that
probation.
the
united
states
district
court
held
scarpelli’s
claim
to
be
valid,
held
that
he
was
entitled
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
to
a
hearing
prior
to
any
revocation
of
his
probation.
he
also
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel
at
that
hearing.
the
state
of
wisconsin
appealed
that
decision
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
court
was
affirmed.
in
the
interim
period,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
also
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
scarpelli’s
probation
was
illegally
revoked
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
the
federal
constitution,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
they
did
not,
i
do
not
believe
there's
anything
in
wisconsin
opinion
or
wisconsin’s
supreme
court
opinion
that
you
can
interpret
as
saying
we
are
bound
by
the
decision
in
hahn
versus
burke
and
hahn
had
been
the
first
case
deciding,
he
had
a
right
to
have
a
hearing.
wisconsin
has
a
statute
that
says
that
anytime
you
place
a
man
on
probation,
during
that
term
of
probation,
you
may
modify
the
terms
and
conditions
of
probation
and
you
may
extend
the
period
of
probation
supervision.
now,
no
matter
how
this
court
resolves
the
right
to
counsel
issue,
scarpelli
is
entitled
or
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
prior
to
the
revocation
of
his
probation.
no
one
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
took
any
action
to
extend
scarpelli’s
probationary
period.
the
illegal
revocation
of
that
probation,
we
contend
cannot
operate
to
extend
that
period
of
the
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
i’m
not
your
honor.
i’m
just
talking
first
about
the
moot
decision.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
my
position
if
the
case
is
moot
and
as
a
result
that
the
illegal
revocation,
his
probation
may
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct,
your
honor
and
that
is
my
theory
that
we
could
go
back
to
wisconsin
that
would
be
my
position
that
they
can’t
hold
that
hearing.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct
and
so
that
i
can
go
back
to
wisconsin
now
and
argue
look,
you
have
from
seven
years
from
july
9th
of
1965
as
of
july
9,
1972,
the
seven
years
has
expired,
you
didn’t
extend
the
probationary
period,
you
can’t
--
you
no
longer
have
any
authority
or
control
over
this
man
to
give
him
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
which
your
honor?
mr.
william
m.
coffey
there
is
no
authority
whatsoever
in
the
law
since
state
of
wisconsin
to
extend
this
man’s
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
pardon
me?
mr.
william
m.
coffey
it’s
not
a
federal
law.
it’s
the
--
as
a
matter
of
the
operation
of
the
state
law,
his
probation
wasn’t
extended,
his
seven
years
are
up
and
therefore
that
no
one
has
extended
that
probationary
period
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
don’t
believe
that
the
statute
is
not
itself
executed.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
you
may
have
--
you
may
very
well
have
to.
i
right
really
say
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct
but
the
position
that
i
have
taken
is
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
not
here
contending
that
scarpelli
is
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
they’re
not
here
contending
that
hahn
v.
burke
which
was
decided
by
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
isn’t
the
law.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
pardon
me.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
morrissey
involved
parole.
hahn
v.
burke
which
is
out
of
the
seventh
circuit
involved
probation,
scarpelli
involves
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
scarpelli
is
out.
he
is
presently
out
i
believe
on
both
state
and
federal
parole.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
correct.
that
the
revocation
was
illegal
and
therefore
nothing
told
the
running
of
it.
the
seven
years
of
expired
and
in
the
question
moot.
i’ll
leave
the
mootness
question
for
a
moment,
let's
to
go
to
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
in
morrissey,
this
court
held
that
due
process
required
a
hearing
prior
to
revocation
of
parole.
the
court’s
decision
is
based
on
the
determination
or
the
finding
by
this
court
that
this
is
a
procedure
or
a
proceeding
where
an
individual,
if
he
loses
his
freedom
even
though
conditional
suffers
a
grievous
loss
and
therefore
due
process
applies
and
the
question
is
what
process
is
due.
in
morrissey,
the
court
recommends
and
suggests
that’s
constitutionally
mandated
for
a
parolee
that
the
procedure
include
a
written
notice,
a
disclosure
of
the
evidence
against
the
parolee,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
person.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
the
recital
of
the
conditions
is
alleged
to
violate
and
the
basis
of
the
issue.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i’m
sorry.
and
the
basis
on
which
you
claim
he
violated
the
conditions
of
his
parole.
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
to
present
witnesses,
documentary
evidence
and
right
to
confront
and
cross
examine
witnesses
with
the
exception
that
you
don’t
have
the
right
of
confrontation
if
there’s
a
determination
that
it’s
a
danger
to
the
witnesses.
then
he
is
entitled
to
the
neutral
and
detached
officer
and
he
is
also
entitled
to
written
statement
of
the
evidence
relied
on
in
the
reasons
for
revoking
the
parole.
now,
to
grant
that
right
to
parolees
and
to
recognize
that
a
parolee
is
entitled
constitutionally
to
that
kind
of
a
hearing
suggests
there
is
no
real
distinction
or
difference
between
probationers
and
parolees.
and
in
fact,
with
a
parolee,
you
are
dealing
with
someone
that
has
been
in
the
institution,
who
has
served
the
sentence
and
who
has
–
it
is
just
the
questions
as
whether
he
is
going
to
be
returned.
with
the
probationer,
you
are
dealing
with
a
person
who
has
never
been
in
the
institution.
and
in
wisconsin,
that
the
judicial
determination
made
at
the
time
someone
is
placed
on
probation
is
that
the
person
is
not
likely
again
to
commit
crime
and
he
is
not
a
threat
to
the
community
and
therefore
he
should
not
suffer
the
penalty
of
incarceration.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
well,
at
least
at
the
moment
probation
is
granted
that’s
the
determination
that
is
made.
subsequent
events
may
prove
that
to
be
erroneous
and
subsequent
events
proved
many
things
erroneous.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
believe
that
would
be
accurate,
yes.
and
then
this
is
an
individual
who
has
never
been
put
in
the
penal
institution.
so
i
believe
that
all
of
the
reasoning
and
all
of
the
rationale
with
morrissey
and
parolees
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
probationer
and
that
the
same
hearing
requirements
should
be
required
in
terms
of
the
probationer
as
in
the
parolee.
the
question
in
this
case
is
if
morrissey
is
extended
to
probation
revocation
proceedings
and
the
same
type
of
hearing
as
is
set
forth
in
morrissey
is
required
in
the
probation
revocation
proceedings,
does
that
mean
also
that
the
individual
is
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel?
he
is
a
counsel
of
his
own
choosing,
a
retained
counsel
that
is
court
appointed
counsel,
so
i
think
then
the
basis
of
some
decisions
goldberg
versus
kelly
and
the
like
of
this
court,
there
could
be
an
argument
made
that
the
person
that’s
in
the
position
to
retain
his
own,
his
own
attorney
under
the
precedence
of
this
court
is
clearly
entitled
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel
and
the
only
really
open
question
is
whether
the
indigent
is
entitled
to
be
represented
by
appointed
counsel.
i
wouldn’t
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
they
do
your
honor.
it’s
interesting
that
scarpelli
arises
in
to
a
racine
county
for
five
or
six
years
prior
to
hahn
versus
burke
or
any
of
these
cases.
the
state
of
wisconsin,
milwaukee
county
which
is
the
most
populous
county
in
the
state
by
a
large
number
is
a
city
of
the
first
class.
in
milwaukee
county
for
five
or
six
years
prior
to
1970,
probation
violators
were
given
a
hearing
and
a
lawyer.
the
only
places,
you
didn’t
get
a
hearing
and
a
lawyer
were
in
counties
outside
of
milwaukee
county
and
so
that
however
since
these
cases,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
decided
that
both
probationers
and
parolees
are
entitled
to
hearings
and
they
also
have
decided
that
they
are
entitled
to
be
represented
by
lawyers,
that
they
are
entitled
to
be
represented
by
court
appointed
lawyers
if
they
cannot
afford
to
hire
their
own.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
it
is
your
honor.
it’s
almost
word
for
word.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
under
the
due
process
clause,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
well
what
happened
--
what
happened
is
this
kind
of
law
involved
procedure.
hahn
versus
burke
was
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
you
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
in
a
probation
revocation
case.
after
hahn
v.
burke,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decided
state
ex
rel.
johnson
v.
cady
and
said
that
probationers
and
parolees
were
entitled
to
hearings
prior
to
the
revocation
--
but
they
were
not
entitled
to
court
appointed
counsel.
then,
scarpelli
was
decided
by
united
states
district
court
and
then
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
then
the
united
states
--
then
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decided
state
ex
rel
bernal
to
be
someone
that
was
involved.
the
juvenile
said,
he
had
to
have
a
right
--
he
had
a
right
to
be
represented
by
a
lawyer
at
his
probation
revocation
proceeding
and
they
later
decided
state
the
all
strike
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
also
held
that
an
adult
was
entitled
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
that’s
the
one
situation
where
it
probably
could
be
a
valid
distinction
between
a
hearing
and
a
right
to
award
because
it’s
pretty
irrefutable
if
you
have
amended
some
probation.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
you
could
draw
that
distinction.
i
have
some
problems
with
it.
i
think
my
own
view
would
be
that
it’s
much
simpler
to
say
that
he
has
the
right
to
have
a
hearing
and
he
has
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
because
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
what
they
say.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
they
have
not.
if
the
united
states
district
court
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
well,
the
wisconsin,
i
assume
that
if
this
court
rejects
the
argument
that
counsel
is
required
at
probation
or
parole
revocation
proceedings,
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
may
very
well
reevaluate
its
position.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
and
that
i
think
that
they
decided
purely
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitution.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct
justice.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
i
believe
or
i
think
it
more
appropriate
to
say
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
a
hearing
and
i
think
there
is
a
requirement
to
counsel
is
that
in
the
case
you
do
have
the
irrefutable
fact
of
a
subsequent
conviction,
lawyers
have
things
to
do
that
is
applying
being
many
lawyers
are
not
going
to
be
made
defendants
around
who
will
say,
“gee,
i
want
to
hear
you.”
before
you
can
revoke
my
probation
because
even
though
i
was
just
convicted
down
the
hall
of
a
subsequent
criminal
sentence.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
my
own
experience
--
they’re
not
in
the
position
to
parole.
mr.
platz
and
that
is
my
own
experience
would
be
that
the
subsequent
--
i
have
never
run
into
the
case
where
the
subsequent
conviction
of
another
crime
has
not
resulted
in
the
revocation
of
parole.
i
have
run
into
the
situation
where
the
subsequent
conviction
of
another
offense
has
not
resulted
in
the
revocation
of
probation
but
not
in
the
parole
but
i’m
not
in
the
position
to
say
that
that’s
not
the
case
that
may
well
happen
but
i
think
what’s
important
when
we
talk
about
these
hearings
and
when
we
say
we
are
going
to
set
up
these
procedures
and
afford
probationers,
the
rights
of
the
morrissey
hearing
is
we
have
to
recognize
that
their
right
is
really
meaningless
if
he
doesn’t
have
an
attorney.
these
people
are
in
jail.
first
of
all,
most
times
anyone
is
facing
a
probation
or
a
parole
revocation,
the
man
is
in
jail
and
so
say,
you
can
call
witnesses
and
you
can
produce
documentary
evidence
and
you
can
do
this
and
you
can
do
that.
this
is
a
man
that’s
confined.
he
can’t
do
anything.
he
gets
--
if
he’s
lucky
he
gets
one
phone
call
a
day
out
of
county
jail,
he
can
send
the
letter
and
hope
people
show
up,
but
he
has
no
way
of
effectively
communicating
with
anyone
in
terms
of
preparing
his
defense,
if
he
has
a
defense.
and
if
he
has
counsel,
counsel
is
able
to
do
that.
i
think
also
important
is
the
aba
recognizes
the
function
of
a
lawyer,
the
role
that
the
lawyer
can
play
and
the
aba
minimum
standards
for
criminal
justice,
the
standards
relating
to
probation.
american
bar
association
recommendation
is
that
there
are
people
facing
probation
revocation
being
provided
with
counsel.
and
they
state,
the
central
task
of
ascertaining
whether
the
prisoners
committed
the
ex-alleged
and
measuring
the
acts
proven
against
the
standard
to
which
he
was
obliged
to
conform
is
precisely
the
business
of
the
criminal
trial
itself
where
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
has
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
immutable
principles
of
justice.
indeed,
many
confess
revocation
proceedings,
the
conduct
charged
actually
constitutes
the
commission
of
a
criminal
act.
it
would
seem
patently
at
war
with
the
central
concept
of
procedural
justice
to
deny
to
a
person
his
liberty
at
stake,
the
opportunity
to
hear
and
meet
the
specific
charge
against
him
with
the
benefit
of
counsel.
in
this
case,
in
wisconsin
as
i’m
sure
in
most
other
places,
gerald
scarpelli
was
on
seven
years
probation.
gerald
scarpelli
could
have
done
six
years,
11
months
and
ten
days
on
probation
and
he
could
then
have
had
his
probation
revoked
at
a
15-year
sentence
executed,
and
he
would
have
received
no
credit
for
the
six
years,
11
months
and
whatever
number
of
days
it
was,
he
was
on
probation
because
it’s
dead
time.
when
a
man
is
facing
the
possible
loss
of
15
years
of
his
life
in
a
very
substantial
period
of
incarceration
in
a
penal
institution,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you’re
going
to
give
me
a
hearing
which
i
think
is
and
should
be
constitutionally
mandated
and
required
that
to
make
that
hearing
meaningful
and
to
have
form
and
not
just
to
have
form
but
to
have
substance
to
the
hearing.
there
has
to
be
a
counsel
involved.
i
think
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
chief
justice
burger’s
opinion
in
morrissey,
the
person
running
the
hearing
and
the
people
that
set
up
the
rules
and
the
procedures
can
see
to
it
that
the
hearing
is
conducted
to
only
issues
that
are
germane
and
relevant
to
the
determination
as
to
whether
probation
should
be
revoked.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
would
only
state
--
i
can
only
state
in
response,
chief
justice
that
yes
i
think
sure
there’s
a
possibility
of
that
if
the
persons
that
set
up
the
procedures
and
conduct
the
hearings
allow
them
to
become
too
cumbersome
and
to
too
much
like
a
criminal
trial.
yes,
but
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
need
for
that.
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
anyone
is
asking
for
or
requiring
and
i
think
also
in
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
white,
that
criminal
lawyers
will
do
what
they’re
permitted
to
do
and
if
you
have
a
hearing
examiner
or
you
have
a
procedure
adopted
in
a
particular
state
that
will
allow
the
criminal
lawyer
to
turn
it
into
criminal
trial,
he
may
very
well.
but
i
suggest,
that
i
think
morrissey
makes
it
clear
that
makes
it
clear
that
that’s
not
the
procedure
or
the
requirement
this
court
is
setting
up
and
that
it’s
the
obligation
or
the
duty
of
those
persons
that
are
setting
up
these
procedures
to
see
to
it
and
conduct
those
hearings
in
a
way
that
they
don’t
become
criminal
trials.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
your
honor
anytime
you
provide
legal
counsel
to
affecting
the
systems
to
counsel,
yes
it
satisfies
the
due
process
claim.
i
also
think
that
has
been
suggested
in
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
argersinger
and
probably
also
in
morrissey.
the
university
of
wisconsin
law
school,
if
a
clinical
program
set
up
that
walk
on
the
state
institution.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
would
have
no
--
i
personally
would
have
no
difficulty
with
trained
persons
other
than
lawyers
conducting
the
hearings
or
representing
the
defendants
as
long
as
someone
was
in
a
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
man
had
a
defense
or
anything
in
mitigation
of
the
violation
that’s
alleged
to.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
can’t
cite
the
court
to
any
study
as
such
but
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
defended
--
been
a
criminal
lawyer
for
some
eight
or
nine
years
now.
i’ve
been
in
a
lot
of
probation
revocation
proceedings.
i
would
hate
to
have
in
some
days
my
freedom
taken
away
from
and
some
of
the
basis
on
which
i
have
seen
people
go
to
jail.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
as
i
question
about
when
you
give
someone
a
standard
as
involved
in
scarperlli
association
with
known
criminal.
what
is
known
criminal?
in
wisconsin
up
until
two
or
three
months
ago,
traffic
offenses
were
criminal
offenses.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
he
was
not
shot
--
he
was
shot,
he
was
not
killed.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
no,
that
was
scarpelli’s
claim
was
that
he
was
told
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
--
to
induce
the
confession
that
the
other
man
didn't
recover.
but
as
my
understanding
was
that
he
had
recovered.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes,
in
scarpelli’s
case,
fine.
maybe
you
have
what’s
known
as
known
criminal
but
i
--
you
know,
when
you
give
someone,
a
probation
officer,
a
standard
such
as
bad
--
don’t
associate
with
people
of
bad
character
etcetera,
i
mean
that’s
really
a
vague,
vague
standard
to
have
someone
making
a
determination
or
to
send
someone
to
prison.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
would
think
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
probably
as
many
as
answers
that
question
as
our
probation
parole
officers.
i
don’t
mean
to
stand
here
and
suggest
that
any
large
percentage
of
probation
parole
officers
are
in
a
hurry
to
put
people
back
in
institutions
but
probation
and
parole
officers
are
human.
they’re
subject
to
the
same
deficiencies
as
the
rest
of
us.
that
personal
--
personality
conflicts
and
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
read
that
in
the
material
that
mr.
platz
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
m.
coffey
an
addendum
to
his
brief.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
but
i
don’t
find
this
probably
--
but
that’s
corrected
this
also.
i
don’t
know
how
anyone
arrived
at
that
conclusion.
yes,
i
would
think
that
probation
officer
probably
would
be
slightly
irritated
upon
the
return
of
someone
to
probation
and
going
to
the
institution.
i’m
not
sure
that
he
would
necessarily
take
it
as
a
failure
that
is
a
personal
failure.
he
may
very
well
take
it
as
being
a
someone
not
demonstrating
good
faith
with
him
and
cooperation
with
him
and
therefore
maybe
he
shouldn’t
be
as
helpful
and
--
mr.
william
m.
coffey
i
think
they
are
chief
justice,
i
really
do.
i
think
they
have
a
great
deal
of
authority,
they
have
a
great
deal
power
and
they
don’t
have
a
lot
of
guidelines
and
standards
and
i
really
believe
and
i
really
feel
that
it’s
something
that
there
does
have
to
be
check
and
i
don’t
think
a
man’s
freedom
or
rights
should
really
depend
on
something
we
all
believed
to
be
and
hope
to
be
the
good
faith
and
the
good
intension
of
the
supervising
agent.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
in
the
probation
revocation
proceedings
that
occurred
in
milwaukee
county
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
new
procedures
mandated
by
morrissey,
the
hearings
were
in
court
in
milwaukee
county.
that
was
only
in
milwaukee
county.
there
were
departmental
decisions
outside
the
milwaukee
county.
but
in
milwaukee
county
the
hearing
was
in
court,
the
probation
officer
was
called
and
sworn
as
a
witness.
usually,
the
presiding
judge
asked
the
probation
officer,
the
questions
in
terms
of
do
you
have
a
report
to
make
but
the
district
attorney
was
present
and
the
defense
counsel
was
present
and
the
conclusion
of
the
agent’s
report
to
the
court,
counsel
for
both
of
the
district
attorney
officer
and
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
cross
examine
or
ask
questions
to
the
agent
and
then
the
court
made
its
determination.
mr.
william
m.
coffey
pardon
me?
mr.
william
m.
coffey
yes
sir.
thank
you.
