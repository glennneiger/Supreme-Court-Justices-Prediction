justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
testimony
in
this
case
about
the
pretrial
identification?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
during
the
defendant's
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
is
not
gilbert
problem
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
that
wade
did
apply
the
photographic
identification.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
prosecutor
in
examining
his
witness
brought
out
the
fact
of
pretrial
identification
absent
counsel,
it
wouldn’t
help
to
show
no
taint
then,
would
it,
under
gilbert?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
problem
like
that
in
this
case
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
then
that
if
wade
were
held
to
have
applied
in
this
case
that
this
case
would
automatically
be
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
so
that
the
finding
of
no
taint,
there
was
a
finding
of
no
taint
wasn’t
there,
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
wouldn’t
overwrite
a
gilbert
violations?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cohn
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
isn't
the
standard
rule
as
the
federal
court
rule
of
evidence
that
pretrial
identifications
are
admissible
in
evidence
to
corroborate
in
court
identification?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
generally
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
government
wants
to
do
if
may
have
the
witness
identify
the
witness
in
court
and
then
say,
did
you
identify
it
before,
and
the
witness
can
answer
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
the
government
can
simply
offer
the
pretrial
identification
without
even
getting
around
to
the
identification
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cohn
would
you
say
that
if
it
were
held
that
wade
applies
to
photographic
identifications
of
those
involved
in
this
case
that
based
on
what
we’ve
just
been
over
here,
there
was
a
gilbert
error
in
the
sense
that
the
prosecution
should
be
charged
with
having
relied
on
pretrial
identification,
so
that
a
finding
of
no
taint
would
not
suffice?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
even
though
the
government
carefully
avoided
pretrial
identifications
on
its
side
of
the
case,
the
defense
and
the
defense
brought
it
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
first
presented
it
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
nevertheless
a
finding
of
no
taint
would
not
suffice
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
will
the
government
avoid
this
sort
of
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
there
was
not
a
--
assuming
there
was
not
a
so
called
gilbert
violation
here
and
then
the
finding
of
no
taint
would
--
would
avoid
a
reversal
even
if
wade
applied
the
photographs.
wasn't
there
a
finding
of
no
taint
here
sufficient
for
that
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
came
from
an
independent
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
satisfied
that
would
suffice
even
if
wade
were
applicable
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
of
gilbert?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
accepting
that
finding
though,
the
finding
in
form
is
sufficient
in
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
or
either
one
to
gilbert
whether
there
indicated
i
think
the
government
in
this
case
achieved,
not
only
asked
the
witness
to
identify
the
government
courtroom
now,
but
referred
to
a
pretrial
identification
to
which
is
set
that
engaged
naturally,
and
that
the
pretrial
identification
had
been
without
counsel
that
then
there
was
an
automatic
reversal
and
then
a
no
taint
finding
would
not
suffice.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
wade
if
the
government
just
has
in-court
identification
and
there
has
been
a
pretrial
identification
without
counsel,
if
the
government
can
demonstrate
that
the
in-court
identification
is
independently
based
and
not
tainted
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
doesn’t
be
the
absence
of
counsel
won't
result
in
a
reversal?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
taint
is
irrelevant.
justice
byron

because
you

unless
there
is
a

violation
here,
the
issue
of
the

in

here
