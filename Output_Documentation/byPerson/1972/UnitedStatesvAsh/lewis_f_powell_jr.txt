the
first
photographic
identification
in
this
case
was
on
february
3,
1966.
justice
lewis

powell,

let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
mr.
ash
had
been
indicted
at
that
time.
would
your
formulation
have
required
the
presence
of
counsel
when
the
fbi
agent
presented
those
five
photographs?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
one
of
those
witness
is,
let’s
say
the
customer
who
was
in
the
bank,
had
been
in
seattle
and
the
fbi
had
wanted
to
ascertain
whether
she
could
identify
the
indicted
defendant.
your
position
as
i
understand
it
is
that
counsel
would
have
to
go
and
be
present
at
that
identification.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
formulation
doesn’t
depend
at
all
on
whether
or
not
the
photographic
showing
is
or
is
not
suggestive,
counsel
must
be
present
at
any
event?
