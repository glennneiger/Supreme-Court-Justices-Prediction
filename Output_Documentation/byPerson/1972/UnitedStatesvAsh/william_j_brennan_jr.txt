may

you
mr.
cohn?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
ever
been
the
suggestion
of
harmless
error
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
automatic
reversal
only
so
we’re
not
harmless
error?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
mr.
cohn
that
your
argument
mr.
ash
was
that
there
was
a
gilbert
violation
because
the
way
that
the
ash
photograph
got
into
evidence,
and
if
that
were
so
and
the
principles
of
wade
and
gilbert
applied
to
photographic
identification
and
then
i
take
it
that
gilbert
would
require
a
reversal
unless
there
were
harmless
error.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
recalling
gilbert
we
sent
the
case
back
for
a
new
trail
unless
there
were
a
determination
of
harmless
error,
no
issue
of
taint
then
involved,
if
there
--
justice
