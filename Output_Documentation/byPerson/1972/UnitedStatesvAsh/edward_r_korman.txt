mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
review
a
five
to
four
en
banc
decision
of
that
court
which
held
that
under
the
sixth
amendment,
a
defendant
in
criminal
case
is
entitled
to
the
presence
of
counsel
at
a
pretrial
showing
of
photographs
to
witnesses
to
the
crime
of
which
he
is
accused
of
committing.
this
case
arises
out
of
an
armed
bank
robbery
of
branch
office
of
the
american
security
and
trust
company
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
25th
day
of
august,
1965.
a
lone
gunman
entered
the
bank
and
he
now
put
a
stocking
mask
over
a
portion
of
his
face,
announced
his
intentions
and
told
everyone
not
to
move.
immediately
thereafter,
a
second
man
entered
the
bank,
ran
behind
the
teller’s
cages,
scooped
up
the
money
and
run
out
of
the
bank
followed
by
the
gunman
who
had
initially
entered
the
bank.
as
the
bandits
ran
from
the
bank
they
again
removed
the
stocking
masks
which
covered
their
faces
up
to
the
bottom
of
their
noses
and
at
this
point
they
were
both
seen
with
their
faces
uncovered
by
a
woman
who
was
seated
in
a
car
outside
of
the
bank.
the
two
robbers,
however,
made
good
their
escape
and
it
was
not
until
some
five
months
after
the
robbery
had
occurred
that
a
convicted
felon
concededly
seeking
consideration
from
the
authorities
told
them
that
one
charles
ash
had
asked
him,
the
informant,
to
participate
in
the
bank
robbery
and
had
on
the
day
following
the
robbery
admitted
his
participation
to
the
informant.
on
the
basis
of
this
information
police
gathered
five
photographs,
one
each
of
the
defendant
ash,
one
of
bailey
who
is
accomplice
which
the
informant
had
told
the
authorities,
ash
had
implicated
as
the
second
man
in
the
robbery
and
three
other
photographs.
these
are
all
black
and
white
and
they
were
shown
to
four
witnesses
to
that
robbery.
two
of
them
were
bank
tellers
and
both
of
them
selected
photographs
of
ash
as
the
gunman.
neither
was
positive
in
their
identification.
the
third
witness
who
was
shown
these
photographs
was
a
customer
at
the
bank
who
had
seen
the
gunman
enter
the
bank
and
put
the
mask
on.
he
also
selected
the
photograph
of
ash,
his
identification
was
likewise
inconclusive.
the
fourth
witness
was
the
woman
who
had
seen
the
two
running
from
the
bank.
she
also
picked
out
a
photograph
of
ash
as
being
one
of
the
two
whom
she
had
seen
running
from
the
bank.
her
identification
was
likewise
uncertain.
the
case
for
a
number
of
reasons
was
not
scheduled
for
trial
until
may
8,
1965
some
two-and-half
years
after
the
showing
of
the
initial
photographs
and
some
three
years,
almost
three
years
after
the
date
that
the
crime
was
committed.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
charge
of
the
case,
no
doubt
wondering
whether
any
of
the
eyewitnesses
would
be
able
to
make
any
kind
of
identification
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
had
five
color
photographs
displayed
to
each
of
the
four
witnesses.
the
five
photographs
included
one
each
of
bailey,
one
of
ash
and
three
others.
the
two
defendants
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
unconnected
with
the
robbery.
the
two
photographs
of
the
perspective
of
the
defendants
who
would
go
on
trial
the
following
day,
what
is
known
as
i
believe
called
“full
length
fbi
case
photographs”
indicating
their
height
and
their
build.
the
three
other
photographs
were
not
full
length,
but
were
cut
at
some
point
above
and
below
the
chest.
at
this
point
the
results
of
the
photograph
at
display
were
again
inconclusive.
three
of
the
witnesses
picked
out
ash’s
photograph
and
said
that
he
looked
like
him
or
words
to
that
effect,
their
identification
was
uncertain.
a
fourth
witness
the
gentleman
who
was
a
customer
at
the
bank
could
not
pick
out
any
photograph.
again,
as
in
the
first
instance
none
of
the
witnesses
were
able
to
pick
out
the
photograph
of
the
codefendant
bailey.
the
district
court
after
a
hearing,
pretrial
hearing,
held
that
the
initial
photographic
at
display
which
took
place
five
months
after
the
robbery,
was
not
impermissibly
suggestive
and
that
regardless
of
the
propriety
of
the
second
showing
of
photographs,
there
was
an
independent
basis
for
the
uncertainty
at
that
point
eyewitness
identifications.
at
the
trial
the
government
introduced
the
testimony
of
its
informant
who
under
oath
testified
that
ash
had
asked
him
to
participate
in
the
robbery
and
that
the
day
following
the
robbery
ash
had
admitted
his
part
of
participation
to
him.
the
government
also
introduced
the
testimony
of
the
four
eyewitnesses.
three
of
them
again
made
inconclusive
identifications.
they
were
not
positive
of
their
identification
of
ash,
nearly
picking
him
out
as
looking
like
or
words
to
that
effect.
the
fourth
woman
who
was
seated
on
the
car
who
had
of
all
the
witnesses
perhaps
of
greatest
opportunity
to
view
the
bandits
unmasked
picked
out
both
ash
and
bailey
positively.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
again,
none
of
the
witnesses,
none
of
the
other
three
witnesses
where
able
to
select
bailey
at
all
as
even
looking
like
the
person
that
had
--
the
second
person
that
had
been
involved
in
the
robbery.
the
prosecution
during
its
case
did
not
elicit
the
fact
that
there
had
been
any
pretrial
identification
from
photographs.
bailey’s
counsel,
however,
was
anxious
to
show
that
mrs.
apple
who
had
made
a
positive
identification
of
bailey
in
the
courtroom
had
been
on
unable
the
day
before
the
pick
is
photograph
out
of
the
five
that
we
shown
to
her
and
so
during
the
defense
case,
he
called
the
fbi
agent,
then
mrs.
bailey
to
elicit
the
fact
that
one,
she
had
indeed
been
shown
photographs,
she
had
picked
out
one
person
as
being
one
of
the
two
she
had
seen
running
from
the
bank,
but
was
on
able
to
pick
out
the
photograph
of
bailey
and
he
then
offered
the
photograph
of
bailey
into
evidence.
at
this
point
the
united
states
attorney
asked
that
ash’s
photograph
be
offered
into
evidence
presumably
lest
the
jury
get
the
impression
that
the
other
person
she
has
picked
out
was
someone
other
than
ash.
ultimately
all
five
photographs
were
admitted
and
the
jury
thus
became
aware
that
mrs.
apple
had
made
an
uncertain
identification
of
ash’s
photograph
on
the
day
before
trial.
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
verdict
as
to
bailey.
as
to
him
the
only
evidence
was
the
positive
identification
of
the
witness
in
court.
the
jury
was
hung
and
after
the
trial,
the
judge
directed
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
the
defendant
ash,
however,
was
convicted
of
all
counts
of
the
indictment
arising
out
of
the
armed
bank
robbery.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
whether
the
second
pretrial
photographic
display
was
improperly
suggestive.
the
majority
stated
that
certainly
the
elements
of
suggestiveness
was
strong
enough
so
that
it
cannot
be
assumed
there
was
no
undue
suggestiveness
in
the
absence
of
explicit
findings
by
the
trial
court.
and
of
course
the
trial
court
had
not
reached
this
issue,
but
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
stated
that
it
was
aware
that
there
are
indications
of
setting
in
part
the
inference
of
undue
suggestiveness.
since
these
other
indications
were
not
conclusive
and
since
that
there
were
no
explicit
findings
by
the
district
court
on
this
issue,
the
majority
held
that
remand
would
ordinarily
be
required,
but
for
its
conclusion
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
counsel
at
the
photographic
display
on
the
day
before
trial
and
that
thus
a
reversible
error
was
committed
in
the
admission
of
the
fact
that
mrs.apple
had
in
fact
made
an
identification
albeit
an
uncertain
one
on
the
day
prior
to
trial.
we
believe
that
this
holding
which
is
contrary
to
the
holdings
of
nine
other
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
state
court
is
erroneous.
accordingly
we
ask
that
the
judgment
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
the
further
proceedings,
suggested
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
decision
on
majority
of
the
five
principally
on
the
holding
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
wade
that
a
defendant
was
entitled
to
counsel
at
forced
confrontations
between
himself
and
the
witness
or
victim
of
the
offense.
in
holding
that
an
interview
between
a
prosecutor
and
the
witness
at
which
the
accused
was
not
present,
was
like
a
lineup
“at
critical
stage
of
the
preceding,”
the
court,
below
we
submit,
ignored
the
critical
and
crucial
distinctions
between
a
lineup
and
photographic
display.
the
basis
of
this
court’s
holding
as
we
read
wade
was
that
lineups
were
susceptible
to
many
forms
of
subtle
suggestion
which
increased
the
possibility
of
erroneous
identification
and
not
only
were
they
susceptible
to
this
kind
of
subtle
suggestion,
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings,
it
was
impossible
for
a
defendant
to
reconstruct
them
at
trial.
the
reasons
for
the
inability
to
reconstruct
these
events
was
peculiar
to
the
nature
of
the
tense
emotional
atmosphere
that
is
involved
on
a
victim
or
a
witness
to
a
crime
is
confronted
with
the
person
who
was
accused
or
perpetrating
the
crime.
the
possibility
of
subtle
suggestion
is
present
simply
in
the
fact
that
it’s
a
live
lineup,
the
defendant
is
asked
to
walk
in
to
move
about,
to
don
clothing,
to
utter
words.
they
suggest
that
potential
for
suggestion
has
been
suggested
as
present
and
everything
from
the
clothing
he
wears
to
the
matter
in
which
the
lights
are
focused
on
him.
under
these
circumstances,
given
the
inability
to
reconstruct
these
subtle
forms
of
suggestion,
it
was
held
that
a
lawyer
was
present
to
enable
the
defendant
at
trial
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
and
to
elicit
before
the
jury
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
those
elements
which
were
improper
in
the
conduct
of
the
lineup.
photographic,
the
difference
between
what
judge
wilkey
in
his
dissenting
opinion
called
this
little
drama
of
the
live
confrontation
and
the
showing
of
five
or
six
still
photographs
to
a
witness
or
a
victim
is
apparent.
initially
there
are
just
these
five
photographs,
there
is
no
defendant
present.
he
doesn’t
move
around.
he’s
not
asked
to
anything,
he’s
not
asked
to
don
any
clothing,
no
lights
are
shown
upon
him.
in
addition,
the
photographs
are
generally
shown
in
a
much
less
emotionally
charged
atmosphere.
they
are
shown
either
in
the
office
of
the
prosecutor
or
as
in
this
case
at
the
home
or
place
of
business
of
the
witnesses
to
the
crime.
and
then,
while
it’s
true
there
is
still
a
potential
for
suggestion,
it
is
true
that
the
photographs
themselves
may
not
be
properly
selected
or
in
some
other
way,
indicate
to
the
witness
who
it
is
that
the
police
think
committed
this
offense.
but
that
kind
of
suggestion
is
readily
shown
simply
by
looking
at
the
photographs
at
a
suppression
hearing
and
indeed
in
this
case
the
defendant
argued
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
able
to
give
a
minute
description
of
the
suggestive
influences
that
is
found
present
simply
on
the
basis
of
viewing
the
photographs.
now,
this
is
not
the
same
as
simply
taking
a
picture
of
the
lineup.
a
picture
of
the
lineup
would
just
show
what
happened
during
that
one
split
second
when
the
picture
was
taken.
it
would
not
show
what
happen
the
minute
after
or
a
minute
before
so
that
this
is
not
as
the
defendant
suggests
in
his
brief,
the
equivalent
of
taken
a
picture
of
a
lineup.
it
is
also
true
that
there
is
a
potential
for
suggestion
in
the
words
that
maybe
spoken
to
the
witness
when
the
photographs
are
shown,
but
that
kind
of
suggestion;
number
one,
can
be
revealed
by
the
witness.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
not
be
able
to
testify
truthfully
as
to
what
was
said
to
him
when
photographs
were
shown.
more
significantly,
there
is
no
more
potential
for
suggestion
there
than
in
an
interview
without
any
photographs
at
all.
after
all
if
the
prosecutor
was
so
inclined,
you
could
simply
tell
the
witness,
“well,
remember
you
gave
us
a
description,
you
said
one
of
them
you
said
the
gunman
in
this
case
was
19
years
old.
he
was
black,
light
skinned.
he
was
well
dressed.
he
was
wearing
glasses.
well,
you
go
into
the
courtroom
and
take
a
look
and
see
if
you
see
him
at
the
defense
table.”
now,
that’s
the
most
apparent
kind
of
suggestion
which
can
take
place
without
any
kind
of
photographs
being
present.
yet,
it’s
never
been
held
nor
as
i
understand
has
it
ever
been
suggested
that
any
time
a
prosecutor
even
talks
with
the
witness
to
the
crime
that
a
lawyer
is
required
to
be
present.
and
so
for
these
substantial
reasons
we
think
that
this
proceeding
of
showing
of
still
photographs
is
significantly
different
and
that
this
is
not
a
critical
stage
of
proceeding.
also
there
is
another
significant
fact
that
differentiates
this
case
from
the
lineup
case.
this
is
what
transpires
when
a
prosecutor
talks
with
the
witness
is
simply
a
preparation
by
the
prosecutor
of
the
witness
for
trial.
we
know
of
no
case,
one
that
is
ever
held
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
at
a
proceeding
which
he
himself
is
not
present.
particularly
this
is
so
when
the
preceding
is
nothing
more
than
an
interview
had
between
the
witness
and
the
prosecutor
as
part
of
his
preparations
for
the
trial
of
the
case.
and
i
think
that
it
is
significant
not
only
the
language
of
the
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
in
wade
which
constantly
stressed
the
forced
confrontation
between
the
accused
and
the
witness
to
the
offense,
but
also
the
concurring
opinions
of
the
justices
who
cast
the
deciding
votes
on
the
issue
of
whether
a
lineup
was
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
justice
black
in
concurring
in
that
portion
of
the
opinion
of
which
this
court
said
that
a
lineup
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
said
“i
agree
with
the
court
that
a
lineup
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
criminal
preceding
against
accused
--
against
an
accused
because
it
is
a
stage
of
which
the
government
makes
use
of
his
custody
to
obtain
crucial
evidence
against
him.”
mr.
justice
clark
who
cast
the
concurring
vote
in
that
case
relied
principally
on
miranda
versus
arizona
as
the
basis
for
his
concurrence.
that
case
of
course
involved
custodial
interrogation
of
an
accused
who
is
in
custody
and
so
that
that
factor,
the
accused
was
present
when
this
transpired
and
needed
a
lawyer
to
help
him
because
of
his
very
presence
there,
we
regard
to
be
one
of
the
other
crucial
factors
which
distinguish
this
case
from
wade.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes
there
was.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
only
during
the
defendant’s
case,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
right,
the
prosecutor
did
not
offer
any
evidence
during
the
course
of
the
trial
then.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
do
not
–
i
don't
follow
you
in
what
way?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
there
is
--
we
do
not
dispute
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
the
government
who
asked
that
ash’s
photograph
be
introduced
and
that
it
was
at
the
government’s
behest
that
all
five
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
and
that’s
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
by
the
district
court.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it
would
not.
given
both
the
state
of
the
law,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
cases
which
have
decided
this
issue
and
it
held
that
a
lawyer
is
not
present
that
it
need
not
be
present
at
the
photographic
display,
the
respondent
has
understandably
relegated
to
second
place
in
his
brief
the
defense
of
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
instead
he
would
have
this
court
decide
this
case
on
an
issue
which
was
not
dealt
with
by
the
district
court,
which
the
court
of
appeals
felt
was
not
properly
presented,
given
this
state
of
the
record.
that
is
that
in
effect
the
showing
on
the
day
before
trial
was
so
impermissibly
suggestive
as
to
constitute
a
violation
of
due
process.
as
i’ve
noted,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
quite
properly
it
was
very
careful
in
dealing
with
this
issue
and
in
stating
that
they
could
not
and
would
not,
absent
specific
findings
by
the
district
court
on
this
particular
question
rule
on
this
issue.
i
think
this
careful
disposition
was
correct
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
the
constitution
of
course
provides
that
all
criminal
trials
shall
be
by
jury
in
article
iii,
section
2.
a
finding
that
a
particular
photographic
identification
was
so
impermissibly
suggestive
as
to
constitute
a
violation
of
due
process
necessarily
ousts
from
the
jury
its
function
of
considering
the
reliability
and
credibility
of
this
eyewitness
identification,
even
whereas
here
all
of
the
facts
can
be
brought
before
the
jury.
so
that
before
a
court
reaches
such
a
conclusion,
before
a
court
determines
to
oust
from
the
jury
its
crucial
fact
finding
function
under
the
constitution,
should
be
very
careful
to
do
so
on
a
record
that
is
complete
on
findings
that
are
made
by
district
court
and
should
not
reach
out
and
decide
it
on
an
inadequate
record.
second
is
worth
noting
that
in
this
case
are
the
factors
which
the
court
of
appeals
eluded
to
which
indicated
the
possibility
that
there
was
no
such
undue
suggestion
that
would
lead
to
a
due
process
violation.
one,
despite
this
alleged
suggestion
and
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
these
photographs
to
the
extent
that
they
were
suggestive
were
suggestive
as
to
bailey,
as
they
were
to
ash
yet
not
a
single
witness
was
even
able
to
pick
out
bailey's
photograph
and
even
say
so
much
that
he
looked
like
bailey.
in
the
second
place
despite
the
suggestion
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
he
was
acquitted
by
the
judge
after
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
verdict.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
in
the
second
place
even
as
to
ash,
three
of
the
witnesses
on
the
day
before
trial
were
able
to
give
only
uncertain
identifications
and
the
fourth
wasn’t
even
able
to
pick
out
his
photograph.
so
that
and
in
addition
because
of
the
way
the
proceedings
were
handled,
the
pretrial
hearing,
none
of
the
witnesses,
all
but
one
i
should
say,
only
one
of
the
witnesses
was
even
asked
questions
about
the
effect
which
the
viewing
of
the
photographs
had
on
her
the
day
before
trial.
and
the
third
reason
that
i
think
ought
to
be
considered
before
the
court
deals
with
this
is
that
this
is
really
a
factual
issue
that
hasn’t
been
resolved
by
the
two
courts
below.
and
at
this
stage
we
think
it
would
be
improper
for
this
court
to
reach
out
to
decide
the
issue
before
any
consideration
was
given
to
it
by
the
lower
courts.
and
in
this
respect
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
an
analogous
case
of
united
states
against
foster
which
this
court
concluded
by
a
five
to
four
vote
that
in
fact
the
identification
was
impermissibly
suggestive,
but
declined
to
rule
on
harmless
error
argument
that
had
been
advanced
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
saying
that
it
wished
the
lower
courts
to
resolve
that
issue
first
before
it
got
involved
in
what
was
essentially
a
factual
determination.
and
so
for
these
reasons
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
not
at
the
judgment
of
conviction
be
reinstated,
but
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
appropriate
disposition
in
accordance
with
the
suggestion
in
its
opinion.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
just
want
to
allude
to
one
or
two
points.
the
only
real
substantive
policy
reason
which
has
been
suggested
for
having
counsel
present
by
mr.
cohn
is
that
would
act
as
a
deterrent
the
very
fact
that
counsel
was
present
there
would
act
as
a
deterrent
against
the
use
of
suggestive
procedures.
i
don’t
think
that
that
deterrent
is
necessary.
it’s
enough
of
the
deterrent
to
the
prosecutor
that
if
he
engages
in
a
suggestive
identification
procedure,
he
is
going
totally
endanger
the
in-court
identification.
that’s
represented
by
the
very
facts
in
this
case,
but
even
if
we
are
successful
here
we
are
hardly
out
of
the
woods
in
terms
of
sustaining
the
judgment
of
conviction
in
this
case.
so
that
by
engaging
in
suggestive
procedures,
he
is
endangering
the
entire
in-court
identification,
bringing
upon
himself
the
whole
mess
of
problems
before
trial.
in
the
second
place
by
having
a
suggestive
photographic
procedure
he
also
undermines
to
a
substantial
degree
whatever
corroborative
basis
the
fact
that
an
out
of
court
identification
was
made.
it’s
not
likely
to
have
very
much
impact
with
the
jury
that
before
trial,
a
witness
picked
out
a
photograph
in
an
array
that
was
obviously
suggestive.
and
of
course
finally
that
substantive
policy
reason
for
having
a
lawyer
present
was
not
even
suggested
as
i
understood
or
read
the
court's
opinion
in
wade.
also
there’s
been
some
illusion
both
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
mr.
cohn
to
the
government’s
brief
in
wade
where
we’re
quoted
as
saying
that
there’s
no
difference
between
a
photo
lineup
and
a
photographic
display.
what
the
government
said
in
wade
was
that
clearly
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
a
lawyer
was
required
when
photographs
were
shown,
and
that
we
saw
no
difference
as
far
as
lineups
go.
this
court
disagreed
only
to
the
extent
that
it
did
find
the
differences
as
far
as
lineups
went
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
opinion
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
that
the
prosecution
could
show
in
attempting
to
evade
a
taint
finding
that
there
had
in
fact
been
a
prior
identification
by
photographs.
and
these,
unless
there
any
questions,
are
the
only
two
points
that
i
want
to
make.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
review
a
five
to
four
en
banc
decision
of
that
court
which
held
that
under
the
sixth
amendment,
a
defendant
in
criminal
case
is
entitled
to
the
presence
of
counsel
at
a
pretrial
showing
of
photographs
to
witnesses
to
the
crime
of
which
he
is
accused
of
committing.
this
case
arises
out
of
an
armed
bank
robbery
of
branch
office
of
the
american
security
and
trust
company
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
25th
day
of
august,
1965.
a
lone
gunman
entered
the
bank
and
he
now
put
a
stocking
mask
over
a
portion
of
his
face,
announced
his
intentions
and
told
everyone
not
to
move.
immediately
thereafter,
a
second
man
entered
the
bank,
ran
behind
the
teller’s
cages,
scooped
up
the
money
and
run
out
of
the
bank
followed
by
the
gunman
who
had
initially
entered
the
bank.
as
the
bandits
ran
from
the
bank
they
again
removed
the
stocking
masks
which
covered
their
faces
up
to
the
bottom
of
their
noses
and
at
this
point
they
were
both
seen
with
their
faces
uncovered
by
a
woman
who
was
seated
in
a
car
outside
of
the
bank.
the
two
robbers,
however,
made
good
their
escape
and
it
was
not
until
some
five
months
after
the
robbery
had
occurred
that
a
convicted
felon
concededly
seeking
consideration
from
the
authorities
told
them
that
one
charles
ash
had
asked
him,
the
informant,
to
participate
in
the
bank
robbery
and
had
on
the
day
following
the
robbery
admitted
his
participation
to
the
informant.
on
the
basis
of
this
information
police
gathered
five
photographs,
one
each
of
the
defendant
ash,
one
of
bailey
who
is
accomplice
which
the
informant
had
told
the
authorities,
ash
had
implicated
as
the
second
man
in
the
robbery
and
three
other
photographs.
these
are
all
black
and
white
and
they
were
shown
to
four
witnesses
to
that
robbery.
two
of
them
were
bank
tellers
and
both
of
them
selected
photographs
of
ash
as
the
gunman.
neither
was
positive
in
their
identification.
the
third
witness
who
was
shown
these
photographs
was
a
customer
at
the
bank
who
had
seen
the
gunman
enter
the
bank
and
put
the
mask
on.
he
also
selected
the
photograph
of
ash,
his
identification
was
likewise
inconclusive.
the
fourth
witness
was
the
woman
who
had
seen
the
two
running
from
the
bank.
she
also
picked
out
a
photograph
of
ash
as
being
one
of
the
two
whom
she
had
seen
running
from
the
bank.
her
identification
was
likewise
uncertain.
the
case
for
a
number
of
reasons
was
not
scheduled
for
trial
until
may
8,
1965
some
two-and-half
years
after
the
showing
of
the
initial
photographs
and
some
three
years,
almost
three
years
after
the
date
that
the
crime
was
committed.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
charge
of
the
case,
no
doubt
wondering
whether
any
of
the
eyewitnesses
would
be
able
to
make
any
kind
of
identification
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
had
five
color
photographs
displayed
to
each
of
the
four
witnesses.
the
five
photographs
included
one
each
of
bailey,
one
of
ash
and
three
others.
the
two
defendants
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
unconnected
with
the
robbery.
the
two
photographs
of
the
perspective
of
the
defendants
who
would
go
on
trial
the
following
day,
what
is
known
as
i
believe
called
“full
length
fbi
case
photographs”
indicating
their
height
and
their
build.
the
three
other
photographs
were
not
full
length,
but
were
cut
at
some
point
above
and
below
the
chest.
at
this
point
the
results
of
the
photograph
at
display
were
again
inconclusive.
three
of
the
witnesses
picked
out
ash’s
photograph
and
said
that
he
looked
like
him
or
words
to
that
effect,
their
identification
was
uncertain.
a
fourth
witness
the
gentleman
who
was
a
customer
at
the
bank
could
not
pick
out
any
photograph.
again,
as
in
the
first
instance
none
of
the
witnesses
were
able
to
pick
out
the
photograph
of
the
codefendant
bailey.
the
district
court
after
a
hearing,
pretrial
hearing,
held
that
the
initial
photographic
at
display
which
took
place
five
months
after
the
robbery,
was
not
impermissibly
suggestive
and
that
regardless
of
the
propriety
of
the
second
showing
of
photographs,
there
was
an
independent
basis
for
the
uncertainty
at
that
point
eyewitness
identifications.
at
the
trial
the
government
introduced
the
testimony
of
its
informant
who
under
oath
testified
that
ash
had
asked
him
to
participate
in
the
robbery
and
that
the
day
following
the
robbery
ash
had
admitted
his
part
of
participation
to
him.
the
government
also
introduced
the
testimony
of
the
four
eyewitnesses.
three
of
them
again
made
inconclusive
identifications.
they
were
not
positive
of
their
identification
of
ash,
nearly
picking
him
out
as
looking
like
or
words
to
that
effect.
the
fourth
woman
who
was
seated
on
the
car
who
had
of
all
the
witnesses
perhaps
of
greatest
opportunity
to
view
the
bandits
unmasked
picked
out
both
ash
and
bailey
positively.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
again,
none
of
the
witnesses,
none
of
the
other
three
witnesses
where
able
to
select
bailey
at
all
as
even
looking
like
the
person
that
had
--
the
second
person
that
had
been
involved
in
the
robbery.
the
prosecution
during
its
case
did
not
elicit
the
fact
that
there
had
been
any
pretrial
identification
from
photographs.
bailey’s
counsel,
however,
was
anxious
to
show
that
mrs.
apple
who
had
made
a
positive
identification
of
bailey
in
the
courtroom
had
been
on
unable
the
day
before
the
pick
is
photograph
out
of
the
five
that
we
shown
to
her
and
so
during
the
defense
case,
he
called
the
fbi
agent,
then
mrs.
bailey
to
elicit
the
fact
that
one,
she
had
indeed
been
shown
photographs,
she
had
picked
out
one
person
as
being
one
of
the
two
she
had
seen
running
from
the
bank,
but
was
on
able
to
pick
out
the
photograph
of
bailey
and
he
then
offered
the
photograph
of
bailey
into
evidence.
at
this
point
the
united
states
attorney
asked
that
ash’s
photograph
be
offered
into
evidence
presumably
lest
the
jury
get
the
impression
that
the
other
person
she
has
picked
out
was
someone
other
than
ash.
ultimately
all
five
photographs
were
admitted
and
the
jury
thus
became
aware
that
mrs.
apple
had
made
an
uncertain
identification
of
ash’s
photograph
on
the
day
before
trial.
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
verdict
as
to
bailey.
as
to
him
the
only
evidence
was
the
positive
identification
of
the
witness
in
court.
the
jury
was
hung
and
after
the
trial,
the
judge
directed
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
the
defendant
ash,
however,
was
convicted
of
all
counts
of
the
indictment
arising
out
of
the
armed
bank
robbery.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
whether
the
second
pretrial
photographic
display
was
improperly
suggestive.
the
majority
stated
that
certainly
the
elements
of
suggestiveness
was
strong
enough
so
that
it
cannot
be
assumed
there
was
no
undue
suggestiveness
in
the
absence
of
explicit
findings
by
the
trial
court.
and
of
course
the
trial
court
had
not
reached
this
issue,
but
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
stated
that
it
was
aware
that
there
are
indications
of
setting
in
part
the
inference
of
undue
suggestiveness.
since
these
other
indications
were
not
conclusive
and
since
that
there
were
no
explicit
findings
by
the
district
court
on
this
issue,
the
majority
held
that
remand
would
ordinarily
be
required,
but
for
its
conclusion
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
counsel
at
the
photographic
display
on
the
day
before
trial
and
that
thus
a
reversible
error
was
committed
in
the
admission
of
the
fact
that
mrs.apple
had
in
fact
made
an
identification
albeit
an
uncertain
one
on
the
day
prior
to
trial.
we
believe
that
this
holding
which
is
contrary
to
the
holdings
of
nine
other
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
state
court
is
erroneous.
accordingly
we
ask
that
the
judgment
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
the
further
proceedings,
suggested
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
decision
on
majority
of
the
five
principally
on
the
holding
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
wade
that
a
defendant
was
entitled
to
counsel
at
forced
confrontations
between
himself
and
the
witness
or
victim
of
the
offense.
in
holding
that
an
interview
between
a
prosecutor
and
the
witness
at
which
the
accused
was
not
present,
was
like
a
lineup
“at
critical
stage
of
the
preceding,”
the
court,
below
we
submit,
ignored
the
critical
and
crucial
distinctions
between
a
lineup
and
photographic
display.
the
basis
of
this
court’s
holding
as
we
read
wade
was
that
lineups
were
susceptible
to
many
forms
of
subtle
suggestion
which
increased
the
possibility
of
erroneous
identification
and
not
only
were
they
susceptible
to
this
kind
of
subtle
suggestion,
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings,
it
was
impossible
for
a
defendant
to
reconstruct
them
at
trial.
the
reasons
for
the
inability
to
reconstruct
these
events
was
peculiar
to
the
nature
of
the
tense
emotional
atmosphere
that
is
involved
on
a
victim
or
a
witness
to
a
crime
is
confronted
with
the
person
who
was
accused
or
perpetrating
the
crime.
the
possibility
of
subtle
suggestion
is
present
simply
in
the
fact
that
it’s
a
live
lineup,
the
defendant
is
asked
to
walk
in
to
move
about,
to
don
clothing,
to
utter
words.
they
suggest
that
potential
for
suggestion
has
been
suggested
as
present
and
everything
from
the
clothing
he
wears
to
the
matter
in
which
the
lights
are
focused
on
him.
under
these
circumstances,
given
the
inability
to
reconstruct
these
subtle
forms
of
suggestion,
it
was
held
that
a
lawyer
was
present
to
enable
the
defendant
at
trial
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
and
to
elicit
before
the
jury
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
those
elements
which
were
improper
in
the
conduct
of
the
lineup.
photographic,
the
difference
between
what
judge
wilkey
in
his
dissenting
opinion
called
this
little
drama
of
the
live
confrontation
and
the
showing
of
five
or
six
still
photographs
to
a
witness
or
a
victim
is
apparent.
initially
there
are
just
these
five
photographs,
there
is
no
defendant
present.
he
doesn’t
move
around.
he’s
not
asked
to
anything,
he’s
not
asked
to
don
any
clothing,
no
lights
are
shown
upon
him.
in
addition,
the
photographs
are
generally
shown
in
a
much
less
emotionally
charged
atmosphere.
they
are
shown
either
in
the
office
of
the
prosecutor
or
as
in
this
case
at
the
home
or
place
of
business
of
the
witnesses
to
the
crime.
and
then,
while
it’s
true
there
is
still
a
potential
for
suggestion,
it
is
true
that
the
photographs
themselves
may
not
be
properly
selected
or
in
some
other
way,
indicate
to
the
witness
who
it
is
that
the
police
think
committed
this
offense.
but
that
kind
of
suggestion
is
readily
shown
simply
by
looking
at
the
photographs
at
a
suppression
hearing
and
indeed
in
this
case
the
defendant
argued
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
able
to
give
a
minute
description
of
the
suggestive
influences
that
is
found
present
simply
on
the
basis
of
viewing
the
photographs.
now,
this
is
not
the
same
as
simply
taking
a
picture
of
the
lineup.
a
picture
of
the
lineup
would
just
show
what
happened
during
that
one
split
second
when
the
picture
was
taken.
it
would
not
show
what
happen
the
minute
after
or
a
minute
before
so
that
this
is
not
as
the
defendant
suggests
in
his
brief,
the
equivalent
of
taken
a
picture
of
a
lineup.
it
is
also
true
that
there
is
a
potential
for
suggestion
in
the
words
that
maybe
spoken
to
the
witness
when
the
photographs
are
shown,
but
that
kind
of
suggestion;
number
one,
can
be
revealed
by
the
witness.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
not
be
able
to
testify
truthfully
as
to
what
was
said
to
him
when
photographs
were
shown.
more
significantly,
there
is
no
more
potential
for
suggestion
there
than
in
an
interview
without
any
photographs
at
all.
after
all
if
the
prosecutor
was
so
inclined,
you
could
simply
tell
the
witness,
“well,
remember
you
gave
us
a
description,
you
said
one
of
them
you
said
the
gunman
in
this
case
was
19
years
old.
he
was
black,
light
skinned.
he
was
well
dressed.
he
was
wearing
glasses.
well,
you
go
into
the
courtroom
and
take
a
look
and
see
if
you
see
him
at
the
defense
table.”
now,
that’s
the
most
apparent
kind
of
suggestion
which
can
take
place
without
any
kind
of
photographs
being
present.
yet,
it’s
never
been
held
nor
as
i
understand
has
it
ever
been
suggested
that
any
time
a
prosecutor
even
talks
with
the
witness
to
the
crime
that
a
lawyer
is
required
to
be
present.
and
so
for
these
substantial
reasons
we
think
that
this
proceeding
of
showing
of
still
photographs
is
significantly
different
and
that
this
is
not
a
critical
stage
of
proceeding.
also
there
is
another
significant
fact
that
differentiates
this
case
from
the
lineup
case.
this
is
what
transpires
when
a
prosecutor
talks
with
the
witness
is
simply
a
preparation
by
the
prosecutor
of
the
witness
for
trial.
we
know
of
no
case,
one
that
is
ever
held
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
at
a
proceeding
which
he
himself
is
not
present.
particularly
this
is
so
when
the
preceding
is
nothing
more
than
an
interview
had
between
the
witness
and
the
prosecutor
as
part
of
his
preparations
for
the
trial
of
the
case.
and
i
think
that
it
is
significant
not
only
the
language
of
the
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
in
wade
which
constantly
stressed
the
forced
confrontation
between
the
accused
and
the
witness
to
the
offense,
but
also
the
concurring
opinions
of
the
justices
who
cast
the
deciding
votes
on
the
issue
of
whether
a
lineup
was
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
justice
black
in
concurring
in
that
portion
of
the
opinion
of
which
this
court
said
that
a
lineup
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
said
“i
agree
with
the
court
that
a
lineup
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
criminal
preceding
against
accused
--
against
an
accused
because
it
is
a
stage
of
which
the
government
makes
use
of
his
custody
to
obtain
crucial
evidence
against
him.”
mr.
justice
clark
who
cast
the
concurring
vote
in
that
case
relied
principally
on
miranda
versus
arizona
as
the
basis
for
his
concurrence.
that
case
of
course
involved
custodial
interrogation
of
an
accused
who
is
in
custody
and
so
that
that
factor,
the
accused
was
present
when
this
transpired
and
needed
a
lawyer
to
help
him
because
of
his
very
presence
there,
we
regard
to
be
one
of
the
other
crucial
factors
which
distinguish
this
case
from
wade.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes
there
was.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
only
during
the
defendant’s
case,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
right,
the
prosecutor
did
not
offer
any
evidence
during
the
course
of
the
trial
then.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
do
not
–
i
don't
follow
you
in
what
way?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
there
is
--
we
do
not
dispute
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
the
government
who
asked
that
ash’s
photograph
be
introduced
and
that
it
was
at
the
government’s
behest
that
all
five
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
and
that’s
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
by
the
district
court.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it
would
not.
given
both
the
state
of
the
law,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
cases
which
have
decided
this
issue
and
it
held
that
a
lawyer
is
not
present
that
it
need
not
be
present
at
the
photographic
display,
the
respondent
has
understandably
relegated
to
second
place
in
his
brief
the
defense
of
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
instead
he
would
have
this
court
decide
this
case
on
an
issue
which
was
not
dealt
with
by
the
district
court,
which
the
court
of
appeals
felt
was
not
properly
presented,
given
this
state
of
the
record.
that
is
that
in
effect
the
showing
on
the
day
before
trial
was
so
impermissibly
suggestive
as
to
constitute
a
violation
of
due
process.
as
i’ve
noted,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
quite
properly
it
was
very
careful
in
dealing
with
this
issue
and
in
stating
that
they
could
not
and
would
not,
absent
specific
findings
by
the
district
court
on
this
particular
question
rule
on
this
issue.
i
think
this
careful
disposition
was
correct
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
the
constitution
of
course
provides
that
all
criminal
trials
shall
be
by
jury
in
article
iii,
section
2.
a
finding
that
a
particular
photographic
identification
was
so
impermissibly
suggestive
as
to
constitute
a
violation
of
due
process
necessarily
ousts
from
the
jury
its
function
of
considering
the
reliability
and
credibility
of
this
eyewitness
identification,
even
whereas
here
all
of
the
facts
can
be
brought
before
the
jury.
so
that
before
a
court
reaches
such
a
conclusion,
before
a
court
determines
to
oust
from
the
jury
its
crucial
fact
finding
function
under
the
constitution,
should
be
very
careful
to
do
so
on
a
record
that
is
complete
on
findings
that
are
made
by
district
court
and
should
not
reach
out
and
decide
it
on
an
inadequate
record.
second
is
worth
noting
that
in
this
case
are
the
factors
which
the
court
of
appeals
eluded
to
which
indicated
the
possibility
that
there
was
no
such
undue
suggestion
that
would
lead
to
a
due
process
violation.
one,
despite
this
alleged
suggestion
and
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
these
photographs
to
the
extent
that
they
were
suggestive
were
suggestive
as
to
bailey,
as
they
were
to
ash
yet
not
a
single
witness
was
even
able
to
pick
out
bailey's
photograph
and
even
say
so
much
that
he
looked
like
bailey.
in
the
second
place
despite
the
suggestion
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
he
was
acquitted
by
the
judge
after
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
verdict.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
in
the
second
place
even
as
to
ash,
three
of
the
witnesses
on
the
day
before
trial
were
able
to
give
only
uncertain
identifications
and
the
fourth
wasn’t
even
able
to
pick
out
his
photograph.
so
that
and
in
addition
because
of
the
way
the
proceedings
were
handled,
the
pretrial
hearing,
none
of
the
witnesses,
all
but
one
i
should
say,
only
one
of
the
witnesses
was
even
asked
questions
about
the
effect
which
the
viewing
of
the
photographs
had
on
her
the
day
before
trial.
and
the
third
reason
that
i
think
ought
to
be
considered
before
the
court
deals
with
this
is
that
this
is
really
a
factual
issue
that
hasn’t
been
resolved
by
the
two
courts
below.
and
at
this
stage
we
think
it
would
be
improper
for
this
court
to
reach
out
to
decide
the
issue
before
any
consideration
was
given
to
it
by
the
lower
courts.
and
in
this
respect
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
an
analogous
case
of
united
states
against
foster
which
this
court
concluded
by
a
five
to
four
vote
that
in
fact
the
identification
was
impermissibly
suggestive,
but
declined
to
rule
on
harmless
error
argument
that
had
been
advanced
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
saying
that
it
wished
the
lower
courts
to
resolve
that
issue
first
before
it
got
involved
in
what
was
essentially
a
factual
determination.
and
so
for
these
reasons
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
not
at
the
judgment
of
conviction
be
reinstated,
but
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
appropriate
disposition
in
accordance
with
the
suggestion
in
its
opinion.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
just
want
to
allude
to
one
or
two
points.
the
only
real
substantive
policy
reason
which
has
been
suggested
for
having
counsel
present
by
mr.
cohn
is
that
would
act
as
a
deterrent
the
very
fact
that
counsel
was
present
there
would
act
as
a
deterrent
against
the
use
of
suggestive
procedures.
i
don’t
think
that
that
deterrent
is
necessary.
it’s
enough
of
the
deterrent
to
the
prosecutor
that
if
he
engages
in
a
suggestive
identification
procedure,
he
is
going
totally
endanger
the
in-court
identification.
that’s
represented
by
the
very
facts
in
this
case,
but
even
if
we
are
successful
here
we
are
hardly
out
of
the
woods
in
terms
of
sustaining
the
judgment
of
conviction
in
this
case.
so
that
by
engaging
in
suggestive
procedures,
he
is
endangering
the
entire
in-court
identification,
bringing
upon
himself
the
whole
mess
of
problems
before
trial.
in
the
second
place
by
having
a
suggestive
photographic
procedure
he
also
undermines
to
a
substantial
degree
whatever
corroborative
basis
the
fact
that
an
out
of
court
identification
was
made.
it’s
not
likely
to
have
very
much
impact
with
the
jury
that
before
trial,
a
witness
picked
out
a
photograph
in
an
array
that
was
obviously
suggestive.
and
of
course
finally
that
substantive
policy
reason
for
having
a
lawyer
present
was
not
even
suggested
as
i
understood
or
read
the
court's
opinion
in
wade.
also
there’s
been
some
illusion
both
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
mr.
cohn
to
the
government’s
brief
in
wade
where
we’re
quoted
as
saying
that
there’s
no
difference
between
a
photo
lineup
and
a
photographic
display.
what
the
government
said
in
wade
was
that
clearly
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
a
lawyer
was
required
when
photographs
were
shown,
and
that
we
saw
no
difference
as
far
as
lineups
go.
this
court
disagreed
only
to
the
extent
that
it
did
find
the
differences
as
far
as
lineups
went
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
opinion
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
that
the
prosecution
could
show
in
attempting
to
evade
a
taint
finding
that
there
had
in
fact
been
a
prior
identification
by
photographs.
and
these,
unless
there
any
questions,
are
the
only
two
points
that
i
want
to
make.
