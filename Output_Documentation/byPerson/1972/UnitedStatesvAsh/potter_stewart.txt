justice

stewart
bailey
was
acquitted

--?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
your
claim
as
i
understand
it
that
photographs
cannot
be
used
in
a
variety
of
different
ways
during
the
investigation
of
a
criminal
offense.
for
instance,
if
camera
in
the
bank,
one
of
these
automatic
cameras
takes
a
picture
of
a
holdup
man
there
is
nothing
on
earth,
i
suppose
in
your
argument
that
would
require
the
police
to
take
a
lawyer
with
them
when
they
go
around
the
a
neighborhood
asking
people
“have
you
ever
seen
this
man,
does
he
live
here?”
your
argument
is
limited
to
the
case
of
where
this
kind
of
evidence
is
used
in
the
trial
in
order
to
convict
somebody.
justice
potter
stewart
through
eyewitnesses?
justice
potter
stewart
who
testified?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
does
it
do
that?
it
does
it
through
the
–
through
the
eyewitness
who
did
make
that
pretrial
identification,
or
does
it
do
it
through
a
third
person?
justice
potter
stewart
a
policeman
can
say
this
is
the
best
identify
this?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
done
here?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
we
now?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
number
five
is
ash?
justice
potter
stewart
so
mr.
stanford
is
bailey’s
attorney?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
pennet
is
the
prosecutor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
mr.
rosen
is
ash’s
attorney,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
he
wasn’t
–
he
wasn't
agreeing
until
--
i
mean
at
the
top
of
page
130,
the
same
page
he
said,
“it
is
not
going
into
evidence,”
he
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven’t
read
this
carefully.
i
can’t
during
the
hearing,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
he
finally
when
it
became
evident
that
at
least
one
of
the
pictures
was
going
to
go
into
evidence
that
the
court
had
so
indicated,
if
not
ruled
he
said,
“well,
it
is
better
to
have
all
five
of
them
than
just
one.”
justice
potter
stewart
a
few
moments
ago,
mr.
justice
white
asked
you
something
about
a
gilbert
violation
as
contrasted
with
wade
violation.
what
did
you
understand
by
that?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
i’d
better
just
ask
justice
white
some
other
time,
but
i
did
not
understand
you
--[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
if
you
have
evidence
of
the
pretrial
identification
itself,
which
by
hypothesis
in
gilbert
violated
the
constitution
then
even
an
untainted
in-court
identification
doesn’t
correct
that
constitutional
error,
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
then
you’d
have
a

to

you
referred.
