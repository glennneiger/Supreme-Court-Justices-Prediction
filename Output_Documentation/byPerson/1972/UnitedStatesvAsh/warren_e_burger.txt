the

were

chief

warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

mr.
cohn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohn,
suppose
instead
of
having
had
the
interviews
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
police
had
the
same
five
photographs
of
five
different
people
all
of
whom
where
at
least
have
thought
to
be
suspect
for
one
reason
or
another
and
took
them
around
the
neighborhood
and
exposed
them
to
people
and
said,
“have
you
ever
seen
any
of
these
men
before”
and
then,
if
so
where
and
narrowing
it
down
to
the
day
and
the
details
would
--
what
could
you
say
about
that
exposure
of
the
photographs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
she
already
identified
the
defendant
at
that
time
from
the
stand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
she’d
already
made
an
identification
independent
of
any
photograph,
hadn’t
she?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
this
occur
at
the
time
of
the
government’s
case
in
chief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
he
ruled
or
has
he
indicated
that
he
has
a
leaning,
said
“i
would
be
disposed
to
admit
it,
that’s
hardly
a
ruling
at
that
stage.”
it’s
a
suggestion
of
how
he
feels
about
it,
but
it
doesn’t
foreclose
objection
and
argument,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
least
mr.
rosen
didn’t
have
to
agree.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
there
motions
here
to
severe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
can’t
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
purpose,
when
a
motion
to
severe
is
not
made
and
then
isn't
it
a
reasonable
inference
that
both
of
the
defendants
thought
it
was
their
advantage
not
to
be
severed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i’m
just
talking
about
inferences
from
known
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
agree
that
what
triggered
the
introduction
of
the
five
photographs
was
the
proposal
to
introduce
the
bailey
photograph?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
this
was
not
the
government’s
idea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
once
having
avoided
a
motion
to
severe
and
elected
to
have
a
joint
trial,
this
is
the
type
of
difficulty
that
is
inherent
in
a
joint
trial,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
lawyers
can
foresee
that
and
sometimes
they
can’t.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
justice
powell
had
[laughter]
mr.
cohn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn’t
the
government
have
a
rather
strong
case
when
they
had
the
would
be
accomplish
testified
that
ash
had
asked
him
to
join
in
this
enterprise
and
then
told
him
the
day
afterward
that
he
had
carried
it
out
and
then
you
would
have
one
witness
at
least
who
made
a
positive
identification?
pretty
strong
case
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
government
had
stopped
right
there,
just
put
the
would-be
accomplice,
and
the
lady
who
was
positive
about
the
identification,
stopped
there.
you’d
concede
that
there
was
a
case
for
the
jury
would
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
if
you
had
a
conviction
you
wouldn’t
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
never
know
that
is
a
certainly
in
a
harmless
area
case,
do
we?
this
is
a
judgmental
factor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
