mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
we
submit
is
quite
correct
in
wade
when
it
urged
upon
this
court
that
there
is
no
meaningful
difference
as
concerns
the
right
to
counsel
between
a
pretrial
identification
from
photographs
and
as
similar
pretrial
identification
made
in
the
lineup.
indeed
the
trial
judge
in
this
case,
himself
testified
or
stated
in
may
1968
that
there
had
been
a
recent
increase
in
the
use
of
photographic
identification
in
the
district
of
columbia.
this
was
nine
months
after
the
decision
in
wade.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
case
illustrates
precisely
that
the
government
was
correct
in
wade,
that
wade
was
a
correct
decision
and
still
is
and
that
drawing
an
artificial
distinction
between
corporeal
identification
and
procedures.
and
photographic
identification
procedures
would
not
only
be
in
the
solicitor
general’s
words
“meaningless,”
but
would
permit
the
continued
easy
use
of
this
device
to
evade
this
court’s
clear
holding
in
wade.
one
needs
only
to
examine
the
facts
in
this
case
to
see
how
intentionally
or
unintentionally,
the
united
states
attorney
attempted
to
use
what
i
respectfully
suggest
is
impermissible
suggestiveness.
i
invite
each
and
every
member
of
the
court
to
examine
personally
the
colored
photographs
of
the
1968
identification
procedures
which
are
in
your
file.
i
respectfully
urge
that
they
portray
graphically
what
this
case
is
all
about.
witnesses
to
the
crime
who
had
little
opportunity
to
see
the
robbers
who
made
indefinite
or
no
identifications
at
a
photographic
array
some
five
months
after
the
crime,
who
after
the
crime
could
describe
the
robbers
only
as
to
height
about
six
foot
to
build,
thin
to
slender,
and
color
black
or
light
complexion,
were
shown
almost
three
years
later
and
at
that
the
day
before
the
trial,
five
photographs.
three
of
these
were
sized
3x3
or
3x4.
one
of
the
defendant,
bailey,
was
4x6
and
that
of
the
defendant
ash
was
5x7.
only
two
are
full
length,
only
two
with
height
markers
to
indicate
six
foot.
only
two
carried
the
police
identification
numbers.
only
two
were
thin.
in
each
and
every
case
these
two
were
the
persons
to
be
tried
the
next
day.
this,
the
government
calls
the
preparation
of
a
witness.
the
government
urges
that
the
fact
that
we
know
these
facts
demonstrates
that
the
presence
of
counsel
at
the
photographic
id
could
serve
no
purpose,
but
here
we
part
ways
with
the
government
and
for
two
reasons.
first
as
gilbert
versus
california
makes
clear,
the
requirement
for
the
counsel
at
the
critical
stages
of
procedures
is
not
only
to
permit
the
raising
and
the
proper
presentation
of
defenses,
but
also
as
the
prophylactic
to
deter
the
constitutionally
objectable,
the
practices.
although
i
find
the
curious
and
surprising
to
find
and
learned
united
state
attorney
engaging
in
such
practices
as
i
described,
nine
months
after
the
stowell
and
two
months
after
the
sentience.
i
would
find
it
most
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
united
states
attorney
engaging
in
such
tactics
in
the
presence
of
a
counsel
for
the
defendant.
he
would
stand
there
as
a
reminder,
a
graphical
reminder
that
due
process
must
be
followed.
secondly
although
we
know
much
of
what
happened
at
the
photographic
array,
we
cannot
know
all.
we
do
not
know.
we
cannot
know
the
nuisances,
the
gestures,
the
intonations
that
might
have
been
used.
the
government
urges
that
these
matters
could
be
a
developing
cross
examination.
my
learned
colleague
states
that
there’s
no
reason
in
the
world
why
the
witness
cannot
testify
as
to
the
words
that
were
used.
i
suggest
there
is
a
reason
and
the
reason
is
stated
in
wade.
the
reason
is
that
the
unschooled
layman
who
does
not
and
cannot
be
expected
to
note
those
matters
that
are
important,
and
besides
if
he
does
note
them
they
won’t
work.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice
i
draw
a
line
between
identification
procedures
that
are
investigative.
we
are
now
in
after
kirby
so
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
post
indictment
situation
as
distinguished
from
a
pre-indictment.
where
there
is
investigation
going
on,
where
there
has
not
yet
been
a
focusing,
where
there
has
not
been
an
indictment,
where
no
the
criminal
proceedings
or
prosecutions
which
ever
word
one
wishes
to
use
has
begun,
we
have
an
entirely
different
story
than
we
do
after
indictment.
here
there
has
not
only
been
a
focusing
but
you
have
a
man
who
is
incarcerated
several
blocks
away.
the
trial
is
about
to
begin
and
what
we
have
is
an
identification
which
is
then
entered
as
positive
evidence.
now,
my
colleague
stated
that
this
was
during
the
defendant’s
case
and
i
just
want
to
emphasis,
it
was
by
the
codefendant,
it's
counsel
that
it
was
offered
and
that
the
picture
of
mr.
ash
was
ultimately
offered
by
the
government.
so
that
whatever
tape
there
is
from
the
fact
that
it
was
offered
during
the
defendant’s
case,
it
was
not
during
this
defendant’s
case,
and
he
did
not
offer
it,
then
we’d
have
an
entirely
different
proposition.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct.
what
we
have
here
and
this
is
where
we
also
put
them
on.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
here
is
where
we
part
ground
with
the
government.
the
government
says
“this
is
the
same
as
all
other
preparation
of
witnesses,”
i
would
hope
not,
but
i
suggest
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
production
of
positive
evidence.
positive
evidence
of
identification
and
this
production
whether
it
is
through
a
lineup
which
is
then
used
or
is
through
pictures
which
are
then
used
or
as
shown,
or
anything
of
the
sort,
once
the
criminal
prosecution
has
started,
once
there
is
an
indictment
or
information,
or
an
arrest
to
use
the
words
kirby
case,
once
that
happens
the
right
to
counsel
has
attached.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
in
a
horse
shedding
situation
the
statements
of
the
witness
are
not
admissible
as
positive
evidence,
perhaps
for
him
piece
--
for
the
purposes
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no,
your
honor.
here
we
have
the
situation
of
a
police
officer
saying
that
these
are
the
photographs
that
were
shown
and
mrs.
apple
said
“this
is
the
man.”
the
actual
identification
itself,
i
suggest
is
not
here
sir.
it
is
a
positive
act
in
itself.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
at
that
time
she
had
already
been
asked
by
mr.
bailey’s
counsel.
i
mean,
had
she
already
identified
him
in
court?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
am
sorry,
the
answer
is
yes
sir.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes,
she
had.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
in
court.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
correct,
but
now
are
we
to
use
her
identification
itself
outside
of
court
as
positive
evidence
to
buttress
the
identification
in
court?
and
after
all
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
first
witness,
the
bank
teller
had
to
be
asked
four
times
“is
he
here?”
and
three
times
she
says
“i’m
not
sure”
and
the
fourth
time
well
he
look
similar.
the
second
bank
teller
says
“i
am
not
sure
but
i
think.”
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
if
we
can
refer
to
the
appendix,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
would
be
at
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no
your
honor.
this
occurred
at
the
time
of
mr.
bailey’s
case.
we
have
–-
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes
sir?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
my
understanding.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
my
understanding.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
either
way.
it
can
do
it
through
the
eyewitness,
or
to
do
it
as
i
understand
it
through
the
policeman
or
in
this
case
the
united
states
attorney
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
what
was
done
here
was,
well,
first
of
all
she
was
asked,
on
page
—
well,
if
i
can
start
on
page
104
of
the
appendix.
mr.
stanford
is
bailey’s
attorney
and
she
asked
this
“i
show
you
what
has
in
marked
defendant
exhibit
number
five.”
this
is
on
middle
of
the
page,
“mrs.
apple.
is
this
photograph
of
the
man
you
identified
as
being
involved
in
the
robbery?”
“yes
it
is”
“i
see.”
now,
there
it
is
stops
because
at
that
point
mr.
stanford
wanted
to
offer
all
the
pictures
and
there
was
an
objection
made,
the
page
105
and
there
was
a
colloquy
and
they
were
withdrawing.
now,
we
go
over
toward
the
end
where
mr.
stanford
calls
the
police
officer.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
on
page
123
is
where
mr.
fallon,
the
police
officer
who
accompanied
–-
this
wasn't
involved
with
the
66.
let
me
get
this,
126.
mr.
berry
who
is
the
fbi
officer
who
accompanied
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
on
page
127,
we
are
talking
in
terms
of
mrs.
apple
now.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
this
is
mr.
bailey’s
attorney,
“did
you
at
anytime
show
her
several
of
photographs
in
color?”
“yes,
i
did.”
“did
she
identify
one
of
these
as
the
man?”
“yes
she
selected
one
she
thought
he
was
the
one.”
all
right,
and
then
shows
them
exhibit
the
five
is
that
one,
that
is
correct.
i
show
you
defendant
exhibit
number
four.
“did
she
make
identification
as
to
him?”
“no,
she
did
not”.
number
four
is
bailey.
she
then
states
that.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
number
five
is
ash.
so
far
the
jury
does
not
know
that
five
is
ash,
okay.
but,
they
now
know
that
four
is
bailey
and
that
she
did
not
identify
bailey
but
she
identified
somebody
else.
now,
at
this
point
the
assistant
us
attorney
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
says,
“i
believe
that
five
photographs
should
go
into
evidence.”
i
am
assuming
where
that
means
the
five
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
whether
there
is
only
ash’s
or
all
five
that
point.
and
mr.
rosen
who
is
ash’s
attorney
says,
“i
will
object
to
that
your
honor.”
all
right,
then
there
is
a
colloquy
that
goes
on,
on
page
128
or
129
in
which
mr.
rosen
is
constantly
objecting
and
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion
as
to
what
should
happen.
all
right,
on
page
130
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
correct.
all
right,
and
then,
on
page
130
about
the
middle
on
page
mr.
rosen
still
says.
“i
will
oppose
that.”
and
then,
the
court
down
at
a
few
lines
“i
would
be
to
disposed
to
admit
it
regardless
of
who
offers
it.”
and
then,
at
the
end
of
the
paragraph
“should
we
introduce
all
five?”
and
mr.
rosen
says,
“that
might
avoid
prejudice
against
ash.”
at
that
point
the
court
has
already
ruled
that
they
are
to
be
admitted.
131
they
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
he
agreed
and
i
suggest
that
he
agreed
that
once
the
court
had
ruled
that
ash,
his
pictures
could
go
in
that
what
his
statement
is
that
the
least
amount
of
prejudice
would
be
of
all
the
five
pictures
go
in,
but
the
court
has
already
ruled
by
this
time
on
mr.
stanford’s
request.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
suggest
your
honor
that
we’ve
had
now
pages
of
argument
on
the
subject
and
that
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph
the
court
himself
suggests
that
should
we
introduce
all
five.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
agree,
your
honor,
if
i
were
there
and
if
i
were
second
guessing
him
i
would
not
agree
to
any
form
of,
but
he
was
the
man
under
fire.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
oh,
he
is
objecting
all
along.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
read
it
and
i
would
certainly
to
say
that
a
permissible
reading.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
what
we
really
have
here
is
a
blatant
situation,
like
where
we
have
the
pictures
instead
of
a
confession
being
used
and
its'
--
it's
a
problem
of
how
you
are
going
to
--
we
have
two
codefendants
in
the
case
and
how
do
we
handle
this
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
by
having
a
counsel
at
the
photographic
identification,
i
suppose
is
the
easy
answer,
by
seeing
that
a
case
such
as
this
is
tried
separately,
rather
than
together.
and
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i’m
afraid
not,
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
the
problem
was
i
am
not
sure.
again,
one
might
say
that
it
would
be
a
better
at
this
point
or
earlier
to
have
made
a
motion
to
severe.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
was
unable
to
find
one
on
motion.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
unfortunately
i
cannot
cross
examine
the
mind
of
rosen,
the
attorney
here
as
to
what
he
had
here.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
possible.
i
can
only
rely
back
on
the
fact
that
this
certainly
did
to
prejudice
my
client
and
if
it
was
offered
by
mr.
bailey,
it
from
--
my
client
stand
point
it
should
not
have
been
admitted
into
evidence
because
it
violated
the
standards
of
wade,
as
well
as
the
standards
of
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
will.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
it
was
the
government’s
idea
then
to
go
on
and
introduce
the
ash
photograph.
that
i
will
lay
at
the
steps
for
the
government.
if
everything
would
have
stopped
with
the
introduction
of
the
bailey
photograph,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
your
honor,
and
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
at
that
the
same
time
it
would
be
avoidable
by
the
government
--
counsel,
by
the
court
cautioning
that
all
that
we
have
to
have
in
here
is
that
there
was
a
photograph
of
mr.
ash
shown
to
mrs.
apple
and
she
did
not
identify
him.
if
everything
would’ve
stopped
there,
we
wouldn’t
have
this
case.
it
was
the
government
going
on
to
say
that
“we
now
want
the
ash
photograph
in
there.”
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
as
far
as
the
in-court
identification
is
concerned,
when
you
say
no
taint.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
was
no
taint
on
the
in-court
identification.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
it
came
from
independent
basis.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no,
you
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
sorry,
your
honor,
if
we
were
at
that
point
if
that
issue
where
here,
i
would
argue
that
based
upon
this
record
that
that
was
not
the
permissible
finding.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
that
issue
was
not
brought
here
by
the
government.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
detailed,
that
it
was
much
too
general
and
i’ll
stand
on
that
if
i
may.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes
mr.
justice?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
sir
because
under
kirby
once
you
have
the
indictment
or
information,
or
arrest
then
i
would
assume
the
rest
having
to
do
with
this
matter.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
my
position,
but
i
do
not
agree
with
all
of
the
unstated
implications
that
i
hear
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
notice
to
counsel
would
be
adequate
and
then
he
could
go
or
he
could
retain
counsel
out
there
to
appear
at
the
photographic
identification.
so
that
i
do
not
think
that’s
any
in
solve
it
full
or
problem
or
even
an
practical.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
and
i
don’t
think
that
the
way
it
is
right.
i
mean
it
is
a
prophylactic
against
this
sort
of
thing
occurring
and
may
i
emphasis
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no
sir
and
the
where
you’ve
had
such
indefinite
identification
as
i
suggest
and
here
again
i
part
ways
with
my
brother
here
that
once
that
the
photographic
identification
could
be
read
to
have
to
contribute
of
whatever
positive
in
this
that
was
to
the
identification
or
at
least
we
cannot
say
that
the
witnesses
would
not
have
been
the
less
definite,
but
for
the
identification.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
whether
it
was
strong
enough
your
honor,
for
the
jury
without
the
photographic
identification
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
oh
sure!
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct,
but
what
we
do
not
know
from
our
vantage
point
is
whether
the
jury
would
have
been
conducted
and
that’s
our
problem.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
a
judgmental
factor
that’s
correct.
if
i
may
comment
on
a
point
of
few
matters
raised
by
the
government
in
few
minutes
that
i
have
here?
the
point
is
raised
that
we
did
not
have
here
at
the
presence
of
the
accused
and
therefore
this
is
different
than
wade.
may
i
suggest
that
that
has
been
answered
in
gilbert.
that
in
gilbert
when
this
court
examined
whether
the
taking
of
the
hand
writing
exemplars
was
a
critical
stage.
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
present
was
not
at
all
dwelt
upon.
what
was
dwelt
upon
was
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
risk
to
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
trial
that
could
not
be
remedied
by
the
trial
proceedings,
so
that
the
talisman
that
the
government
would
now
offers,
though
at
the
time
of
wade
they
too
didn’t
see
it,
the
presence
of
the
defendant
i
suggest
and
nothing
but
a
mystery.
now
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
i
understood
what
he
asked
me.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i’m
not
retired
to
positive
idea
either.
i
heard
him
ask
the
question
to
each
of
us
but
i
am
not
quite
sure,
but
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
correct
but
then
the
next
question
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
when
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but,
i
thought
you
were
also
applying
that
to
the
gilbert
and
the
question
being
whether
the
in-court
identification
can
come
in
at
a
new
trial.
now,
that
is
an
issue
that
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
and
we
would
have
a
requirement
of
a
new
trial
and
then
we’d
have
the
question
of
whether
the
in-court
identification
itself
is
salvage.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
all
right,
okay.
i
am
sorry
then
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
there
would
have
to
be
then
a
new
trial.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes,
then
you'd
have
that
question,
that’s
when
it
is.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
thank
you,
for
the
privilege.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
we
submit
is
quite
correct
in
wade
when
it
urged
upon
this
court
that
there
is
no
meaningful
difference
as
concerns
the
right
to
counsel
between
a
pretrial
identification
from
photographs
and
as
similar
pretrial
identification
made
in
the
lineup.
indeed
the
trial
judge
in
this
case,
himself
testified
or
stated
in
may
1968
that
there
had
been
a
recent
increase
in
the
use
of
photographic
identification
in
the
district
of
columbia.
this
was
nine
months
after
the
decision
in
wade.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
case
illustrates
precisely
that
the
government
was
correct
in
wade,
that
wade
was
a
correct
decision
and
still
is
and
that
drawing
an
artificial
distinction
between
corporeal
identification
and
procedures.
and
photographic
identification
procedures
would
not
only
be
in
the
solicitor
general’s
words
“meaningless,”
but
would
permit
the
continued
easy
use
of
this
device
to
evade
this
court’s
clear
holding
in
wade.
one
needs
only
to
examine
the
facts
in
this
case
to
see
how
intentionally
or
unintentionally,
the
united
states
attorney
attempted
to
use
what
i
respectfully
suggest
is
impermissible
suggestiveness.
i
invite
each
and
every
member
of
the
court
to
examine
personally
the
colored
photographs
of
the
1968
identification
procedures
which
are
in
your
file.
i
respectfully
urge
that
they
portray
graphically
what
this
case
is
all
about.
witnesses
to
the
crime
who
had
little
opportunity
to
see
the
robbers
who
made
indefinite
or
no
identifications
at
a
photographic
array
some
five
months
after
the
crime,
who
after
the
crime
could
describe
the
robbers
only
as
to
height
about
six
foot
to
build,
thin
to
slender,
and
color
black
or
light
complexion,
were
shown
almost
three
years
later
and
at
that
the
day
before
the
trial,
five
photographs.
three
of
these
were
sized
3x3
or
3x4.
one
of
the
defendant,
bailey,
was
4x6
and
that
of
the
defendant
ash
was
5x7.
only
two
are
full
length,
only
two
with
height
markers
to
indicate
six
foot.
only
two
carried
the
police
identification
numbers.
only
two
were
thin.
in
each
and
every
case
these
two
were
the
persons
to
be
tried
the
next
day.
this,
the
government
calls
the
preparation
of
a
witness.
the
government
urges
that
the
fact
that
we
know
these
facts
demonstrates
that
the
presence
of
counsel
at
the
photographic
id
could
serve
no
purpose,
but
here
we
part
ways
with
the
government
and
for
two
reasons.
first
as
gilbert
versus
california
makes
clear,
the
requirement
for
the
counsel
at
the
critical
stages
of
procedures
is
not
only
to
permit
the
raising
and
the
proper
presentation
of
defenses,
but
also
as
the
prophylactic
to
deter
the
constitutionally
objectable,
the
practices.
although
i
find
the
curious
and
surprising
to
find
and
learned
united
state
attorney
engaging
in
such
practices
as
i
described,
nine
months
after
the
stowell
and
two
months
after
the
sentience.
i
would
find
it
most
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
united
states
attorney
engaging
in
such
tactics
in
the
presence
of
a
counsel
for
the
defendant.
he
would
stand
there
as
a
reminder,
a
graphical
reminder
that
due
process
must
be
followed.
secondly
although
we
know
much
of
what
happened
at
the
photographic
array,
we
cannot
know
all.
we
do
not
know.
we
cannot
know
the
nuisances,
the
gestures,
the
intonations
that
might
have
been
used.
the
government
urges
that
these
matters
could
be
a
developing
cross
examination.
my
learned
colleague
states
that
there’s
no
reason
in
the
world
why
the
witness
cannot
testify
as
to
the
words
that
were
used.
i
suggest
there
is
a
reason
and
the
reason
is
stated
in
wade.
the
reason
is
that
the
unschooled
layman
who
does
not
and
cannot
be
expected
to
note
those
matters
that
are
important,
and
besides
if
he
does
note
them
they
won’t
work.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice
i
draw
a
line
between
identification
procedures
that
are
investigative.
we
are
now
in
after
kirby
so
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
post
indictment
situation
as
distinguished
from
a
pre-indictment.
where
there
is
investigation
going
on,
where
there
has
not
yet
been
a
focusing,
where
there
has
not
been
an
indictment,
where
no
the
criminal
proceedings
or
prosecutions
which
ever
word
one
wishes
to
use
has
begun,
we
have
an
entirely
different
story
than
we
do
after
indictment.
here
there
has
not
only
been
a
focusing
but
you
have
a
man
who
is
incarcerated
several
blocks
away.
the
trial
is
about
to
begin
and
what
we
have
is
an
identification
which
is
then
entered
as
positive
evidence.
now,
my
colleague
stated
that
this
was
during
the
defendant’s
case
and
i
just
want
to
emphasis,
it
was
by
the
codefendant,
it's
counsel
that
it
was
offered
and
that
the
picture
of
mr.
ash
was
ultimately
offered
by
the
government.
so
that
whatever
tape
there
is
from
the
fact
that
it
was
offered
during
the
defendant’s
case,
it
was
not
during
this
defendant’s
case,
and
he
did
not
offer
it,
then
we’d
have
an
entirely
different
proposition.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct.
what
we
have
here
and
this
is
where
we
also
put
them
on.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
here
is
where
we
part
ground
with
the
government.
the
government
says
“this
is
the
same
as
all
other
preparation
of
witnesses,”
i
would
hope
not,
but
i
suggest
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
production
of
positive
evidence.
positive
evidence
of
identification
and
this
production
whether
it
is
through
a
lineup
which
is
then
used
or
is
through
pictures
which
are
then
used
or
as
shown,
or
anything
of
the
sort,
once
the
criminal
prosecution
has
started,
once
there
is
an
indictment
or
information,
or
an
arrest
to
use
the
words
kirby
case,
once
that
happens
the
right
to
counsel
has
attached.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
in
a
horse
shedding
situation
the
statements
of
the
witness
are
not
admissible
as
positive
evidence,
perhaps
for
him
piece
--
for
the
purposes
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no,
your
honor.
here
we
have
the
situation
of
a
police
officer
saying
that
these
are
the
photographs
that
were
shown
and
mrs.
apple
said
“this
is
the
man.”
the
actual
identification
itself,
i
suggest
is
not
here
sir.
it
is
a
positive
act
in
itself.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
at
that
time
she
had
already
been
asked
by
mr.
bailey’s
counsel.
i
mean,
had
she
already
identified
him
in
court?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
am
sorry,
the
answer
is
yes
sir.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes,
she
had.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
in
court.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
correct,
but
now
are
we
to
use
her
identification
itself
outside
of
court
as
positive
evidence
to
buttress
the
identification
in
court?
and
after
all
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
first
witness,
the
bank
teller
had
to
be
asked
four
times
“is
he
here?”
and
three
times
she
says
“i’m
not
sure”
and
the
fourth
time
well
he
look
similar.
the
second
bank
teller
says
“i
am
not
sure
but
i
think.”
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
if
we
can
refer
to
the
appendix,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
would
be
at
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no
your
honor.
this
occurred
at
the
time
of
mr.
bailey’s
case.
we
have
–-
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes
sir?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
my
understanding.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
my
understanding.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
either
way.
it
can
do
it
through
the
eyewitness,
or
to
do
it
as
i
understand
it
through
the
policeman
or
in
this
case
the
united
states
attorney
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
what
was
done
here
was,
well,
first
of
all
she
was
asked,
on
page
—
well,
if
i
can
start
on
page
104
of
the
appendix.
mr.
stanford
is
bailey’s
attorney
and
she
asked
this
“i
show
you
what
has
in
marked
defendant
exhibit
number
five.”
this
is
on
middle
of
the
page,
“mrs.
apple.
is
this
photograph
of
the
man
you
identified
as
being
involved
in
the
robbery?”
“yes
it
is”
“i
see.”
now,
there
it
is
stops
because
at
that
point
mr.
stanford
wanted
to
offer
all
the
pictures
and
there
was
an
objection
made,
the
page
105
and
there
was
a
colloquy
and
they
were
withdrawing.
now,
we
go
over
toward
the
end
where
mr.
stanford
calls
the
police
officer.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
on
page
123
is
where
mr.
fallon,
the
police
officer
who
accompanied
–-
this
wasn't
involved
with
the
66.
let
me
get
this,
126.
mr.
berry
who
is
the
fbi
officer
who
accompanied
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
on
page
127,
we
are
talking
in
terms
of
mrs.
apple
now.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
this
is
mr.
bailey’s
attorney,
“did
you
at
anytime
show
her
several
of
photographs
in
color?”
“yes,
i
did.”
“did
she
identify
one
of
these
as
the
man?”
“yes
she
selected
one
she
thought
he
was
the
one.”
all
right,
and
then
shows
them
exhibit
the
five
is
that
one,
that
is
correct.
i
show
you
defendant
exhibit
number
four.
“did
she
make
identification
as
to
him?”
“no,
she
did
not”.
number
four
is
bailey.
she
then
states
that.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
number
five
is
ash.
so
far
the
jury
does
not
know
that
five
is
ash,
okay.
but,
they
now
know
that
four
is
bailey
and
that
she
did
not
identify
bailey
but
she
identified
somebody
else.
now,
at
this
point
the
assistant
us
attorney
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
says,
“i
believe
that
five
photographs
should
go
into
evidence.”
i
am
assuming
where
that
means
the
five
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
whether
there
is
only
ash’s
or
all
five
that
point.
and
mr.
rosen
who
is
ash’s
attorney
says,
“i
will
object
to
that
your
honor.”
all
right,
then
there
is
a
colloquy
that
goes
on,
on
page
128
or
129
in
which
mr.
rosen
is
constantly
objecting
and
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion
as
to
what
should
happen.
all
right,
on
page
130
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
correct.
all
right,
and
then,
on
page
130
about
the
middle
on
page
mr.
rosen
still
says.
“i
will
oppose
that.”
and
then,
the
court
down
at
a
few
lines
“i
would
be
to
disposed
to
admit
it
regardless
of
who
offers
it.”
and
then,
at
the
end
of
the
paragraph
“should
we
introduce
all
five?”
and
mr.
rosen
says,
“that
might
avoid
prejudice
against
ash.”
at
that
point
the
court
has
already
ruled
that
they
are
to
be
admitted.
131
they
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
he
agreed
and
i
suggest
that
he
agreed
that
once
the
court
had
ruled
that
ash,
his
pictures
could
go
in
that
what
his
statement
is
that
the
least
amount
of
prejudice
would
be
of
all
the
five
pictures
go
in,
but
the
court
has
already
ruled
by
this
time
on
mr.
stanford’s
request.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
suggest
your
honor
that
we’ve
had
now
pages
of
argument
on
the
subject
and
that
at
the
end
of
that
paragraph
the
court
himself
suggests
that
should
we
introduce
all
five.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
agree,
your
honor,
if
i
were
there
and
if
i
were
second
guessing
him
i
would
not
agree
to
any
form
of,
but
he
was
the
man
under
fire.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
oh,
he
is
objecting
all
along.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
read
it
and
i
would
certainly
to
say
that
a
permissible
reading.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
what
we
really
have
here
is
a
blatant
situation,
like
where
we
have
the
pictures
instead
of
a
confession
being
used
and
its'
--
it's
a
problem
of
how
you
are
going
to
--
we
have
two
codefendants
in
the
case
and
how
do
we
handle
this
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
by
having
a
counsel
at
the
photographic
identification,
i
suppose
is
the
easy
answer,
by
seeing
that
a
case
such
as
this
is
tried
separately,
rather
than
together.
and
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i’m
afraid
not,
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
the
problem
was
i
am
not
sure.
again,
one
might
say
that
it
would
be
a
better
at
this
point
or
earlier
to
have
made
a
motion
to
severe.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
was
unable
to
find
one
on
motion.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
unfortunately
i
cannot
cross
examine
the
mind
of
rosen,
the
attorney
here
as
to
what
he
had
here.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
possible.
i
can
only
rely
back
on
the
fact
that
this
certainly
did
to
prejudice
my
client
and
if
it
was
offered
by
mr.
bailey,
it
from
--
my
client
stand
point
it
should
not
have
been
admitted
into
evidence
because
it
violated
the
standards
of
wade,
as
well
as
the
standards
of
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i
will.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
it
was
the
government’s
idea
then
to
go
on
and
introduce
the
ash
photograph.
that
i
will
lay
at
the
steps
for
the
government.
if
everything
would
have
stopped
with
the
introduction
of
the
bailey
photograph,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
your
honor,
and
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
at
that
the
same
time
it
would
be
avoidable
by
the
government
--
counsel,
by
the
court
cautioning
that
all
that
we
have
to
have
in
here
is
that
there
was
a
photograph
of
mr.
ash
shown
to
mrs.
apple
and
she
did
not
identify
him.
if
everything
would’ve
stopped
there,
we
wouldn’t
have
this
case.
it
was
the
government
going
on
to
say
that
“we
now
want
the
ash
photograph
in
there.”
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
as
far
as
the
in-court
identification
is
concerned,
when
you
say
no
taint.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
was
no
taint
on
the
in-court
identification.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
it
came
from
independent
basis.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no,
you
honor.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
sorry,
your
honor,
if
we
were
at
that
point
if
that
issue
where
here,
i
would
argue
that
based
upon
this
record
that
that
was
not
the
permissible
finding.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
that
issue
was
not
brought
here
by
the
government.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
detailed,
that
it
was
much
too
general
and
i’ll
stand
on
that
if
i
may.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes
mr.
justice?
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
sir
because
under
kirby
once
you
have
the
indictment
or
information,
or
arrest
then
i
would
assume
the
rest
having
to
do
with
this
matter.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
my
position,
but
i
do
not
agree
with
all
of
the
unstated
implications
that
i
hear
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
notice
to
counsel
would
be
adequate
and
then
he
could
go
or
he
could
retain
counsel
out
there
to
appear
at
the
photographic
identification.
so
that
i
do
not
think
that’s
any
in
solve
it
full
or
problem
or
even
an
practical.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct
and
i
don’t
think
that
the
way
it
is
right.
i
mean
it
is
a
prophylactic
against
this
sort
of
thing
occurring
and
may
i
emphasis
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
no
sir
and
the
where
you’ve
had
such
indefinite
identification
as
i
suggest
and
here
again
i
part
ways
with
my
brother
here
that
once
that
the
photographic
identification
could
be
read
to
have
to
contribute
of
whatever
positive
in
this
that
was
to
the
identification
or
at
least
we
cannot
say
that
the
witnesses
would
not
have
been
the
less
definite,
but
for
the
identification.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
whether
it
was
strong
enough
your
honor,
for
the
jury
without
the
photographic
identification
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
oh
sure!
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
correct,
but
what
we
do
not
know
from
our
vantage
point
is
whether
the
jury
would
have
been
conducted
and
that’s
our
problem.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that’s
a
judgmental
factor
that’s
correct.
if
i
may
comment
on
a
point
of
few
matters
raised
by
the
government
in
few
minutes
that
i
have
here?
the
point
is
raised
that
we
did
not
have
here
at
the
presence
of
the
accused
and
therefore
this
is
different
than
wade.
may
i
suggest
that
that
has
been
answered
in
gilbert.
that
in
gilbert
when
this
court
examined
whether
the
taking
of
the
hand
writing
exemplars
was
a
critical
stage.
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
present
was
not
at
all
dwelt
upon.
what
was
dwelt
upon
was
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
risk
to
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
trial
that
could
not
be
remedied
by
the
trial
proceedings,
so
that
the
talisman
that
the
government
would
now
offers,
though
at
the
time
of
wade
they
too
didn’t
see
it,
the
presence
of
the
defendant
i
suggest
and
nothing
but
a
mystery.
now
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
well,
i
understood
what
he
asked
me.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
i’m
not
retired
to
positive
idea
either.
i
heard
him
ask
the
question
to
each
of
us
but
i
am
not
quite
sure,
but
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
that
is
correct
but
then
the
next
question
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but
when
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
but,
i
thought
you
were
also
applying
that
to
the
gilbert
and
the
question
being
whether
the
in-court
identification
can
come
in
at
a
new
trial.
now,
that
is
an
issue
that
--
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
and
we
would
have
a
requirement
of
a
new
trial
and
then
we’d
have
the
question
of
whether
the
in-court
identification
itself
is
salvage.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
all
right,
okay.
i
am
sorry
then
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
there
would
have
to
be
then
a
new
trial.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes,
then
you'd
have
that
question,
that’s
when
it
is.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
yes.
mr.
sherman
l.
cohn
thank
you,
for
the
privilege.
