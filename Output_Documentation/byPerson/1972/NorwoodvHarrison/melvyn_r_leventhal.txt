mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
plaintiff’s
appellants
are
black
school-age
children
residing
in
tunica
county,
mississippi.
they
filed
this
lawsuit
in
october
of
1970
and
they
alleged
and
subsequently
proved
that
they
are
attending
public
schools
in
mississippi
which
were
under
court
order
to
desegregate
under
alexander
and
under
green
and
that
despite
injunctive
orders
of
the
northern
district
of
mississippi,
the
schools
remained
segregated.
they
alleged
further
that
the
school
--
their
schools
are
segregated
because
there
exists
the
tunica
county
institute
of
learning
which
is
a
private
segregated
and
segregationist
academy
located
in
tunica
county.
they
alleged
further
and
proved
that
this
segregated
tunica
institute
of
learning
was
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
mississippi
receiving
free
textbooks.
and
that
this
textbook
aid
to
the
private
academy
of
tunica
county
represented
unlawful
support
of
racial
discrimination
and
assisted
in
undermining
public
school
desegregation.
they
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
mississippi
statute
which
required
the
distribution
of
such
textbooks
to
the
private
academies
of
mississippi.
essentially,
our
complaint
is
that
the
state
has
a
duty
to
avoid
aligning
itself
with
racial
discrimination.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
1942,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor,
it
has
not.
it
was
enacted
in
1942
and
amended
insignificantly
several
times.
in
1942,
the
statute
provided
aid
to
elementary
school
pupils
only
and
subsequently,
the
statute
was
extended
to
provide
a
textbook
aid
to
high
school
students.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i
believe
two
years
later,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
there
have
been
amendments,
your
honor,
but
our
research
indicates
that
they’re
not
significant
amendments.
they’re
amendments
dealing
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
however,
along
that
line,
there
was
a
significant
change
in
regulations
promulgated
in
1970.
as
pointed
out
in
the
government’s
brief
amicus
curiae,
the
textbook
purchasing
board
in
1970
in
effect,
adopted
a
regulation
which
made
it
possible
for
private
segregated
academies
of
mississippi
to
receive
textbooks
directly
from
the
state
agency.
prior
to
1970,
a
private
academy
depended
upon
a
local
school
district
to
receive
textbooks
and
under
the
emergency
school
assistance
act,
such
public
school
districts
would
lose
federal
money
as
they
continue
to
provide
textbooks
to
private
academies
and
as
a
result,
the
state
agency
adopted
a
regulation
which
permitted,
which
indeed
required
that
the
private
academies
deal
directly
with
the
state
textbook
agency.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
sir.
this
is
a
class
action
and
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--
as
a
result
the
perspective
of
private
schools
or
a
perspective
of
the
present
state
of
public
and
private
education
in
mississippi
is
relevant.
there
is
no
controversy
on
this
basic
point,
your
honors.
there
exists
in
the
state
of
mississippi
a
network
of
private
racially
segregated
academies.
they
operate
throughout
the
state
of
mississippi
and
this
system
was
formed
with
the
purpose
and
has
had
the
effect
of
one;
undermining
public
school
desegregation;
and
two,
providing
white
students
with
an
alternative
to
public
school
desegregation.
all
of
the
academies
are
racially
segregated.
all
were
formed
concurrently
with
the
implementation
of
freedom
of
choice
plans
or
the
implementation
of
green
or
alexander,
decisions
of
this
court
requiring
immediate
attainment
of
unitary
school
systems.
all
were
formed
haphazardly
without
significant
planning
or
resources.
i
shouldn’t
say
all
on
that.
perhaps
one
or
two
were
formed
on
the
basis
of
considerable
planning,
but
the
overwhelming
majority
of
these
academies
were
formed
haphazardly
without
planning,
without
significant
resources.
all
of
the
teachers
and
students
in
attendance
of
these
private
academies
formerly
attended
or
taught
in
the
public
school
system
located
adjacent
to
or
in
the
same
vicinity
as
the
private
academy.
with
few
exceptions,
these
academies
are
all
part
of
a
new
association
called
in
mississippi,
the
private
school
association
and
with
very
few
exceptions,
all
are
members
of
a
private
academy
athletic
conference.
they’re
segregated.
they
were
formed
in
response
to
public
school
desegregation.
they
undermine
public
integrated
education.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor.
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
what
would
occur
if
this
textbook
aid
were
withdrawn.
we
know
it
couldn’t
help
the
private
academies.
we
know
it
would
be
denying
them
in
excess
of
a
half
a
million
dollars
in
basic
inventories
and
it
would
be
denying
them
the
resources
of
the
state
but
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
it
amounts
to
six
dollars
per
pupil,
your
honor.
it
amounts
to
$5000
or
$6000
per
school.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
given
the
finding
effect
in
all
of
these
cases,
all
of
the
cases
involved
in
private
academies
that
--
they
were
formed
on
the
finished
financial
basis.
given
the
widespread
poverty
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
it’s
not
beyond
possibility
that
they
will
return
to
public
schools
if
this
aid
and
other
aid
is
withdrawn.
again,
its
speculative.
we
have
to
concede
that
tuition
grants,
the
withdrawal
of
tuition
grants
like
the
coffey
versus
state
educational
finance
commission
did
not
result
in
the
return
of
white
students
to
public
integrated
schools.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor
there
is
presently
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
a
suit
to
prohibit
the
state’s
--
the
state
public
schools
of
higher
education
from
permitting
the
private
academies
the
use
of
the
athletic
stadiums
of
our
public
colleges
and
universities.
there
is
of
course
the
availability
of
various
state
educational
agencies
and
programs
which
can
be
used
in
the
state,
in
private
academies
of
the
state.
basically,
however,
the
textbook
aid
is
the
outstanding
major
provision
of
aid
to
the
private
academies
by
the
state
of
mississippi
at
this
time.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
sir
or
the
schools
would
have
to
purchase
them.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
your
honor,
if
the
case
is
viewed
as
the
provision
of
six
dollars
of
aid
per
pupil,
it
might
appear
to
be
de
minimis,
but
since
this
is
a
challenge
to
the
provision
of
state
aid,
the
question
is
not
how
much
is
each
child
receiving,
but
how
much
is
the
state
of
mississippi
allocating
and
distributing
to
the
private
schools
of
the
state
and
it's
distributing
in
excess
of
a
half
a
million
dollars
of
state
money.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
we
don’t
know
that
that’s
relevant
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
context.
it’s
clear
that
the
books
are
being
selected
by
the
school.
they’re
being
stocked
by
the
schools.
now,
theoretically,
the
aid
is
going
to
the
student,
but
practically
speaking,
the
schools
are
controlling
the
program.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
indeed
we
do,
your
honor
and
that’s
one
of
the
issues
raised
by
this
appeal.
whether
the
standard
for
reviewing
state
support
of
parochial
schools
is
comparable
to
the
standard
for
reviewing
state
support
of
racially
segregated
schools
and
we
submit,
of
course,
that
the
two
amendments
are
substantially
different
and
we
can
get
to
that
immediately.
the
chief
justice
in
walz
versus
tax
commission
and
i
quote
stated
that,
“an
effort
to
interpret
and
understand
the
establishment
or
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
requires
that
we
apply
constitutional
principles
so
as
to
serve,”
and
i
quote,
“ultimate
constitutional
objectives
as
illuminated
by
history.”
in
walz
versus
tax
commission,
the
court
went
on
to
quote
mr.
justice
douglas
and
said,
“when
the
state
encourages
religious
instruction,
it
follows
the
best
of
our
traditions
or
then
respects
the
religious
nature
of
our
people
and
accommodates
the
public
service
to
their
spiritual
needs.”
in
other
words,
under
the
first
amendment
when
we
look
at
the
history
of
the
religion
clauses,
we
find
that
their
objective
was
not
to
eliminate
any
form
of
state
aid
for
religious
instruction.
instead,
we
find
an
internal
tension
or
instead
as
the
court
has
observed,
we
walk
a
tight
rope
and
we
balance
the
establishment
clause
against
the
free
exercise
clause.
recognize
that
in
terms
of
our
history,
religion
has
served
an
important
function
and
in
terms
of
the
religion
clauses,
we
must
strike
the
balance
and
protect
the
individual
in
his
right,
his
first
amendment
right
to
pursue
his
religious
beliefs.
when
we
turn
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor,
we
find
instead
a
history
marked
by
a
commitment
to
the
elimination
of
state
support
for
racial
discrimination.
this
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
any
approach
to
aid
in
the
context
of
the
religion
clauses
and
aid
in
the
context
of
equal
protection.
we
are
as
a
people
committed
to
recognizing
the
value
of
religion
in
american
life.
at
the
same
time,
we
are
as
a
people
and
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
committed
to
the
elimination
of
racial
discrimination
and
the
support
of
racial
discrimination
by
the
state.
so,
it
is
of
no
help
to
us
in
this
case
to
refer
as
the
district
court
did
to
our
first
amendment
standard.
there
are
again
in
the
words
of
the
chief
justice,
in
the
walz
versus
tax
commission,
ultimate
constitutional
objective
as
illuminated
by
history
in
the
first
amendment
which
are
diametrically
opposed
to
objective
as
illuminated
by
history
in
the
context
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
recognize
this
represents
the
basic
fundamental
error
which
we
bring
to
this
court.
again,
along
the
same
lines,
we
have
since
the
enactment,
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
our
very
recent
history
have
civil
rights
laws
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1957,
in
1961,
in
1964,
in
1968
and
1965
and
1968.
all
of
these
legislations,
all
of
the
decisions
of
the
court
since
cooper
versus
aaron,
since
brown
versus
board
of
education
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
constitutional
objective
as
illuminated
by
history
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
context
is
the
elimination
of
any
state
support
for
racial
discrimination.
when
the
state
of
mississippi
aligns
itself
by
the
provision
of
a
half
a
million
dollars
to
direct
subsidy
to
private
academies
which
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
it
has
violated
this
historical
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
illuminated
by
history.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
don’t
believe
that
the
absence
of
a
specific
purpose
to
discriminate
in
anomaly
undermines
our
claim
or
in
any
way
dilutes
or
attenuates
the
state’s
duty
not
to
align
itself
with
public,
with
racial
discrimination.
in
fact,
when
the
statute
was
passed,
we
had
an
absolute
dual
school
system
in
mississippi,
so
the
issue
could
never
have
arisen
in
1942.
if
anything
we
know
that
the
legislature
of
mississippi
in
1942
provided
textbook
aid
for
segregated
academies
or
for
segregated
schools,
at
that
time
they
were
public.
this
was
reminiscent
of
the
problem
faced
in
brown
versus
board
of
education
where
we
had
no
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
revealed
the
intention
of
congress
with
regard
to
public
education.
in
fact,
there
was
no
public
education,
said
the
court
in
brown,
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
given
that
fact,
the
court
had
to
move
to
other
considerations
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
so,
we
have
a
statute
passed
in
1942
before
the
problem
arose
and
the
question
of
purpose
cannot
be
pursued
in
the
same
way
that
we
would
pursue
purpose
with
the
specific
facts
available.
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
in
1942,
no
sir.
in
19
--
well,
in
1942,
we
had
a
dual
school
system
which
was
lawful.
in
1972,
we
have
a
dual
school
system
that
is
unlawful.
now,
what
is
true,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
statute
and
in
terms
of
the
black
children
of
mississippi
and
this
reminiscent
of
a
woman
--
reminiscent
of
woman
in
power,
it
is
of
no
consolation
to
the
black
children
of
mississippi
or
the
black
population
of
mississippi
that
the
legislature
in
1942
did
not
intend
to
promote
segregation.
the
fact
is,
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
promote
segregation
and
that
promotion
of
segregation
is
the
gravamen
of
our
complaint.
it
is
of
no
consolation
to
the
black
children
that
the
state
does
not
intend
to
do
something
when
the
evil
is
there.
now,
again
on
this
first
amendment
or
this
religion
issue
versus
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue,
in
green
versus
kennedy,
another
three-judge
district
court
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
federal
tax
exemption
benefits
to
the
private
academies
of
mississippi,
the
same
private
academies.
i
remind
the
court
that
a
tax
exemption
was
an
indirect
benefit
to
these
private
academies,
there
was
significantly
less
support
for
racial
discrimination
in
mississippi’s
textbook
statute.
here
we
have
a
direct
grant
of
at
least
a
half
a
million
dollars,
or
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
annually
and
yet,
the
three
judge
district
court
affirmed
by
this
court
held
that
tax
exemption
is
only
minimal
and
remote
involvement
when
compared
to
the
kind
of
identification
in
support
of
religion
prohibited
by
the
establishment
clause.
but
the
governmental
and
constitutional
interest
of
avoiding
racial
discrimination
in
educational
institutions
embraces
the
interest
to
be
--
or
precludes
even
indirect
economic
benefit
to
racial
discrimination.
again,
it’s
juxtaposition
of
the
requirements
of
the
religion
clauses
versus
the
requirement
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
are
of
the
clear
view
that
the
proper
standard
for
reviewing
state
support
for
racially
discriminatory
educational
institutions
can
be
found
in
cooper
versus
aaron.
there,
this
court
held
that
state
support
for
racial
discrimination
through
any
arrangement,
through
any
management
or
any
fund
is
violative
of
equal
protection.
when
the
state
of
mississippi
provides
textbook
aid
and
places
itself
behind
the
racial
discrimination,
and
in
effect
or
in
fact
incurred
this
racial
discrimination,
it
violates
cooper
versus
aaron.
and
our
second
basic
theory
is
that
under
the
principles
of
green
versus
new
kent
county,
virginia,
the
state
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
promote
racially
integrated
education,
that
given
its
support
for
racial
discrimination
in
the
dual
school
system
in
the
past,
it
is
duty
bound
today
to
remove
itself
entirely
from
racial
discrimination.
indeed,
it
has
a
duty
to
quarantine
racial
discrimination.
anything
less
than
that
would
be
violative
of
green
versus
new
kent
county,
virginia.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
have
conducted
--
we
--
extensive
discovery
in
this
case.
we
have
104
deposition
in
--
depositions
in
evidence.
we
believe
that
we’ve
already
made
a
record
against
all
148
academies.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor.
indeed
we
have
and
part
of
the
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
that
they’re
segregate
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
we
have
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
some
have
--
some
school
administrators,
private
school
administrators
testified
that
they
had
an
open
enrollment
policy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor.
they’re
a
handful
of
such
disputes.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
we
believe
that
the
district
courts
concerned
and
confronted
with
private
academies
in
mississippi
have
already
held
that
all
of
these
academies
by
segregationist
institutions
that
question
of
fact.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor
in
--
well,
by
implication
in
this
case,
the
extensive
findings
of
fact
were
not
made
in
this
case,
but
in
other
cases,
in
coffey
i
and
coffey
ii,
in
green
versus
kennedy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
by
implication
it
did.
it
found
that
they
are
racially
segregated
and
it
considered
the
issue
before
the
court
as
framed
by
the
assumption
that
they
were
racially
segregated
and
segregationists
that
is
they
had
a
closed
admissions
policy
that
blacks
would
be
excluded.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
it
didn’t
make
that
specific
finding.
it
assumed
it
for
the
purpose
of
argument,
they
held
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
on
remand,
i
believe
the
district
court
could
look
at
each
school
and
find
in
the
record
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
they
were
segregationists.
now,
this
case
involved
the
taking
of
numerous
depositions
of
private
school
administrators
who
had
an
ample
opportunity
to
intervene
and
protect
their
interests.
no
such
private
academy
intervened.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
that’s
correct
but
at
the
same
time,
the
evidence
showed
that
they
were
formed
at
critical
moments
in
critical
school
districts
and
that,
they
were
in
fact
segregated
schools.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
i
believe,
i’ll
give
you
the
exact
figure.
all
students
are
white
except
for
15
chinese.
this
is
what
school
officials
said.
this
appears
at
footnote
3
of
appendix
a
of
page
1a.
all
students
and
all
faculty
members
are
white
except
for
15
chinese,
16
orientals,
two
indians
and
two
latin
americans.
that’s
out
of
a
total
of
42,000
children.
there’s
not
a
single
black
child
in
any
of
these
academies.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
one
or
two.
not
prior
to
brown.
yes,
one
or
two
prior
to
brown,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
now,
they
could’ve
been
founded
prior
to
brown
and
after
green
and
alexander
expanded
their
program
to
accommodate
whites
who
were
plain
public
integrated
schools
and
to
the
extent
that
they
opened
their
doors,
added
facilities,
added
grades,
they
would
be
demonstrating
that
they’re
segregationist
and
undermining
public
integrated
education
and
should
therefore
be
subject
to
an
injunctive
order
prohibiting
textbook
aid
to
them.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
certainly
possible.
again,
we’re
not
claiming
that
all
private
schools
should
not
receive
textbooks.
our
claim
is
that
a
specific
type
of
private
academy
should
not
be
receiving
that.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
it’s
a
private
school
formed
for
the
purpose
or
having
the
effect
of
providing
white
students
with
an
alternative
to
public
integrated
education.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
sir.
not
necessarily.
it
would
be
true
of
virtually
every
private
school
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
but
i’m
referring
to
the
questions
raised
by
mr.
justice
powell
about
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
they
wouldn’t
be
covered,
your
honor.
you
see,
the
academy
i’m
speaking
of
had
substantially
expanded
its
enrollment
at
key
moments
and
these
are
--
in
other
words,
an
academy
formed
in
1945
which
enrolled
200
pupils
and
served
grades
one
through
four,
through
the
year
1968,
green.
and
then
in
1968,
expanded
its
enrollment
to
1000
white
students
and
served
grades
one
through
12
would
be
a
school
which
was
undermining
public
integrated
education.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
i’m
talking
about
an
effect
principle
which
i’m
prepared
to
limit
to
a
formal
--
formally
de
jure
school
system
or
state
which
operated
a
de
jure
system
of
public
school,
de
jure
segregated
system
of
public
education
which
subsequently
--
subsequent
to
the
integral
--
substantial
integration
of
schools
experienced
a
loss,
a
substantial
loss
of
white
pupils
who
are
presently
attending
the
segregated
academy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
an
open
admissions
policy
would
return
the
state
to
freedom
of
choice.
the
classic
example
in
the
city
of
jackson
where
we
have
lost
40,000,
excuse
me,
40%
of
the
white
students,
we
have
white
citizen's
council
schools
assuming
that
the
white
citizens
council
adopted
an
open
admissions
policy
and
let’s
assume
further
that
the
very
remote
possibility
that
blacks
would
attend
the
white
citizen’s
council
school
came
to
pass,
we
would
have
the
white
citizens
council
still
undermining
public
integrated
education.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor.
i’m
saying
that
if
that
what
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i’m
saying
that
if
they
want
to
go
to
private
schools,
they
ought
to
do
so
without
state’s
support.(voice
overlap)
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
(voice
overlap)
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
sir?
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor
we
agree
with
that
distinction
the
court
makes.
however,
what
we’re
trying
to
get
out
is
subterfuge,
alleged
policies
of
open
admissions.
now
in
the
green
versus
kennedy
case,
a
three-judge
district
court
established
a
series
of
requirements
that
private
schools
would
have
to
satisfy
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
tax
exempt
status.
the
record
shows,
according
to
commissioner
thrower
that
there
are
five
or
six
academies
which
have
qualified
for
tax
exemption
which
by
--
which
only
the
most
naive
would
consider
truly
open.
the
indianola
academy
for
example
has
satisfied
the
requirements
of
green
versus
kennedy.
the
indianola
academy
is
presently
a
tax
exempt
institution.
if
you
look
at
our
brief,
page
18,
you
will
find
an
analysis
of
what
occurred
in
the
indianola
school
district.
the
indianola
academy
presently
enrolls
all
white
children
residing
in
the
municipality
of
indianola
and
that
academy’s
enrollment
tripled
in
the
middle
of
the
school
year
immediately
upon
this
court's
decision
in
alexander
versus
holmes
county.
now
we
submit
that
what
we’re
really
getting
at
here
in
trying
to
establish
a
standard
for
a
private
academy
is
to
be
certain
that
the
standard
of
proof
of
open
admissions
is
very,
very
high
that
there
is
no
excuse
for
irs’
approval
of
the
indianola
academy
as
a
school
with
an
open
admissions
policy.
according
to
irs
data,
there
are
at
least
ten
schools
which
are
clearly
segregationists
which
are
presently
tax
exempt
not
withstanding
green
versus
kennedy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor,
one
of
them
is
indianola
academy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i’m
saying
that
as
long
--
we
agree
with
the
court's
distinction
that
a
school
can
be
in
fact
segregated
and
not
be
segregationist.
at
the
same
time,
we
ask
the
court
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor,
we
concede
that.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
we
view
that
as
the
standard
of
proof
that
ought
to
be
required
of
the
school
like
the
indianola
academy.
if
the
indianola
academy
says
it
has
an
--
it
says
has
an
open
admissions
policy,
it
ought
to
prove
it
not
with
merely
the
policy
but
with
an
integrated
student
body
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no.
i
think
we’ve
got
to
read
that
requirement
in
conjunction
with
other
historical
data.
you
see
we
have
a
network
of
private
schools
in
mississippi
which
were
formed
at
a
critical
moment
or
which
expanded
enrollment
at
a
critical
moment
and
i’m
referring
to
a
standard
to
be
applied
to
such
academies.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that’s
what
we
requested.
however
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that’s
right.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
that’s
correct
and
in
fact
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
oh!
no
sir,
by
no
means,
by
no
means.
now
we
want
to
make
it
clear
that
our
objective
is
to
eliminate
textbook
aid
to
segregationist
academies
or
segregated
academies.
the
question
of
what
standard
should
be
applied
to
determine
what
is
a
segregated
academy
is
not
essential
to
our
lawsuit
by
no
means.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
conceive
--
yes
your
honor,
conceivably.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no
sir.
we
are
recognizing
in
this
litigation
the
right
of
children
to
attend
segregated
schools.
we
are
challenging
their
right
to
attend
such
schools
with
state
aid.
that’s
the
thrust
of
our
lawsuit.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
it’s
conjectural.
it’s
just
as
the
defendants
suggest
that
it
means
that
they’re
not
important.
i
could
suggest
one
that
several
academies
receive
textbooks
until
recently
and
in
anticipation
of
this
lawsuit
decided,
it
would
be
best
to
withdraw
from
the
program
to
avoid
the
shock
of
an
adverse
decision.
so
that
--
why
these
41
schools
don’t
participate
would
be
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor
the
--
a
school
which
grows
dependent
upon
a
particular
type
of
aid
might
be
reluctant
to
wait
for
a
decision
of
this
court
which
they
believe
would
be
adverse
to
withdraw
from
the
program.
in
fact
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
that
any
private
school
has
stated
that
the
textbooks
are
unnecessary
or
undesirable.
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
on
the
other
on
why
these
schools
do
not
receive
the
textbooks.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
plaintiff’s
appellants
are
black
school-age
children
residing
in
tunica
county,
mississippi.
they
filed
this
lawsuit
in
october
of
1970
and
they
alleged
and
subsequently
proved
that
they
are
attending
public
schools
in
mississippi
which
were
under
court
order
to
desegregate
under
alexander
and
under
green
and
that
despite
injunctive
orders
of
the
northern
district
of
mississippi,
the
schools
remained
segregated.
they
alleged
further
that
the
school
--
their
schools
are
segregated
because
there
exists
the
tunica
county
institute
of
learning
which
is
a
private
segregated
and
segregationist
academy
located
in
tunica
county.
they
alleged
further
and
proved
that
this
segregated
tunica
institute
of
learning
was
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
mississippi
receiving
free
textbooks.
and
that
this
textbook
aid
to
the
private
academy
of
tunica
county
represented
unlawful
support
of
racial
discrimination
and
assisted
in
undermining
public
school
desegregation.
they
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
mississippi
statute
which
required
the
distribution
of
such
textbooks
to
the
private
academies
of
mississippi.
essentially,
our
complaint
is
that
the
state
has
a
duty
to
avoid
aligning
itself
with
racial
discrimination.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
1942,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor,
it
has
not.
it
was
enacted
in
1942
and
amended
insignificantly
several
times.
in
1942,
the
statute
provided
aid
to
elementary
school
pupils
only
and
subsequently,
the
statute
was
extended
to
provide
a
textbook
aid
to
high
school
students.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i
believe
two
years
later,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
there
have
been
amendments,
your
honor,
but
our
research
indicates
that
they’re
not
significant
amendments.
they’re
amendments
dealing
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
however,
along
that
line,
there
was
a
significant
change
in
regulations
promulgated
in
1970.
as
pointed
out
in
the
government’s
brief
amicus
curiae,
the
textbook
purchasing
board
in
1970
in
effect,
adopted
a
regulation
which
made
it
possible
for
private
segregated
academies
of
mississippi
to
receive
textbooks
directly
from
the
state
agency.
prior
to
1970,
a
private
academy
depended
upon
a
local
school
district
to
receive
textbooks
and
under
the
emergency
school
assistance
act,
such
public
school
districts
would
lose
federal
money
as
they
continue
to
provide
textbooks
to
private
academies
and
as
a
result,
the
state
agency
adopted
a
regulation
which
permitted,
which
indeed
required
that
the
private
academies
deal
directly
with
the
state
textbook
agency.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
sir.
this
is
a
class
action
and
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--
as
a
result
the
perspective
of
private
schools
or
a
perspective
of
the
present
state
of
public
and
private
education
in
mississippi
is
relevant.
there
is
no
controversy
on
this
basic
point,
your
honors.
there
exists
in
the
state
of
mississippi
a
network
of
private
racially
segregated
academies.
they
operate
throughout
the
state
of
mississippi
and
this
system
was
formed
with
the
purpose
and
has
had
the
effect
of
one;
undermining
public
school
desegregation;
and
two,
providing
white
students
with
an
alternative
to
public
school
desegregation.
all
of
the
academies
are
racially
segregated.
all
were
formed
concurrently
with
the
implementation
of
freedom
of
choice
plans
or
the
implementation
of
green
or
alexander,
decisions
of
this
court
requiring
immediate
attainment
of
unitary
school
systems.
all
were
formed
haphazardly
without
significant
planning
or
resources.
i
shouldn’t
say
all
on
that.
perhaps
one
or
two
were
formed
on
the
basis
of
considerable
planning,
but
the
overwhelming
majority
of
these
academies
were
formed
haphazardly
without
planning,
without
significant
resources.
all
of
the
teachers
and
students
in
attendance
of
these
private
academies
formerly
attended
or
taught
in
the
public
school
system
located
adjacent
to
or
in
the
same
vicinity
as
the
private
academy.
with
few
exceptions,
these
academies
are
all
part
of
a
new
association
called
in
mississippi,
the
private
school
association
and
with
very
few
exceptions,
all
are
members
of
a
private
academy
athletic
conference.
they’re
segregated.
they
were
formed
in
response
to
public
school
desegregation.
they
undermine
public
integrated
education.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor.
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
what
would
occur
if
this
textbook
aid
were
withdrawn.
we
know
it
couldn’t
help
the
private
academies.
we
know
it
would
be
denying
them
in
excess
of
a
half
a
million
dollars
in
basic
inventories
and
it
would
be
denying
them
the
resources
of
the
state
but
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
it
amounts
to
six
dollars
per
pupil,
your
honor.
it
amounts
to
$5000
or
$6000
per
school.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
given
the
finding
effect
in
all
of
these
cases,
all
of
the
cases
involved
in
private
academies
that
--
they
were
formed
on
the
finished
financial
basis.
given
the
widespread
poverty
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
it’s
not
beyond
possibility
that
they
will
return
to
public
schools
if
this
aid
and
other
aid
is
withdrawn.
again,
its
speculative.
we
have
to
concede
that
tuition
grants,
the
withdrawal
of
tuition
grants
like
the
coffey
versus
state
educational
finance
commission
did
not
result
in
the
return
of
white
students
to
public
integrated
schools.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor
there
is
presently
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
a
suit
to
prohibit
the
state’s
--
the
state
public
schools
of
higher
education
from
permitting
the
private
academies
the
use
of
the
athletic
stadiums
of
our
public
colleges
and
universities.
there
is
of
course
the
availability
of
various
state
educational
agencies
and
programs
which
can
be
used
in
the
state,
in
private
academies
of
the
state.
basically,
however,
the
textbook
aid
is
the
outstanding
major
provision
of
aid
to
the
private
academies
by
the
state
of
mississippi
at
this
time.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
sir
or
the
schools
would
have
to
purchase
them.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
your
honor,
if
the
case
is
viewed
as
the
provision
of
six
dollars
of
aid
per
pupil,
it
might
appear
to
be
de
minimis,
but
since
this
is
a
challenge
to
the
provision
of
state
aid,
the
question
is
not
how
much
is
each
child
receiving,
but
how
much
is
the
state
of
mississippi
allocating
and
distributing
to
the
private
schools
of
the
state
and
it's
distributing
in
excess
of
a
half
a
million
dollars
of
state
money.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
we
don’t
know
that
that’s
relevant
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
context.
it’s
clear
that
the
books
are
being
selected
by
the
school.
they’re
being
stocked
by
the
schools.
now,
theoretically,
the
aid
is
going
to
the
student,
but
practically
speaking,
the
schools
are
controlling
the
program.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
indeed
we
do,
your
honor
and
that’s
one
of
the
issues
raised
by
this
appeal.
whether
the
standard
for
reviewing
state
support
of
parochial
schools
is
comparable
to
the
standard
for
reviewing
state
support
of
racially
segregated
schools
and
we
submit,
of
course,
that
the
two
amendments
are
substantially
different
and
we
can
get
to
that
immediately.
the
chief
justice
in
walz
versus
tax
commission
and
i
quote
stated
that,
“an
effort
to
interpret
and
understand
the
establishment
or
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
requires
that
we
apply
constitutional
principles
so
as
to
serve,”
and
i
quote,
“ultimate
constitutional
objectives
as
illuminated
by
history.”
in
walz
versus
tax
commission,
the
court
went
on
to
quote
mr.
justice
douglas
and
said,
“when
the
state
encourages
religious
instruction,
it
follows
the
best
of
our
traditions
or
then
respects
the
religious
nature
of
our
people
and
accommodates
the
public
service
to
their
spiritual
needs.”
in
other
words,
under
the
first
amendment
when
we
look
at
the
history
of
the
religion
clauses,
we
find
that
their
objective
was
not
to
eliminate
any
form
of
state
aid
for
religious
instruction.
instead,
we
find
an
internal
tension
or
instead
as
the
court
has
observed,
we
walk
a
tight
rope
and
we
balance
the
establishment
clause
against
the
free
exercise
clause.
recognize
that
in
terms
of
our
history,
religion
has
served
an
important
function
and
in
terms
of
the
religion
clauses,
we
must
strike
the
balance
and
protect
the
individual
in
his
right,
his
first
amendment
right
to
pursue
his
religious
beliefs.
when
we
turn
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor,
we
find
instead
a
history
marked
by
a
commitment
to
the
elimination
of
state
support
for
racial
discrimination.
this
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
any
approach
to
aid
in
the
context
of
the
religion
clauses
and
aid
in
the
context
of
equal
protection.
we
are
as
a
people
committed
to
recognizing
the
value
of
religion
in
american
life.
at
the
same
time,
we
are
as
a
people
and
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle,
committed
to
the
elimination
of
racial
discrimination
and
the
support
of
racial
discrimination
by
the
state.
so,
it
is
of
no
help
to
us
in
this
case
to
refer
as
the
district
court
did
to
our
first
amendment
standard.
there
are
again
in
the
words
of
the
chief
justice,
in
the
walz
versus
tax
commission,
ultimate
constitutional
objective
as
illuminated
by
history
in
the
first
amendment
which
are
diametrically
opposed
to
objective
as
illuminated
by
history
in
the
context
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
recognize
this
represents
the
basic
fundamental
error
which
we
bring
to
this
court.
again,
along
the
same
lines,
we
have
since
the
enactment,
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
our
very
recent
history
have
civil
rights
laws
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1957,
in
1961,
in
1964,
in
1968
and
1965
and
1968.
all
of
these
legislations,
all
of
the
decisions
of
the
court
since
cooper
versus
aaron,
since
brown
versus
board
of
education
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
constitutional
objective
as
illuminated
by
history
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
context
is
the
elimination
of
any
state
support
for
racial
discrimination.
when
the
state
of
mississippi
aligns
itself
by
the
provision
of
a
half
a
million
dollars
to
direct
subsidy
to
private
academies
which
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
it
has
violated
this
historical
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
illuminated
by
history.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
don’t
believe
that
the
absence
of
a
specific
purpose
to
discriminate
in
anomaly
undermines
our
claim
or
in
any
way
dilutes
or
attenuates
the
state’s
duty
not
to
align
itself
with
public,
with
racial
discrimination.
in
fact,
when
the
statute
was
passed,
we
had
an
absolute
dual
school
system
in
mississippi,
so
the
issue
could
never
have
arisen
in
1942.
if
anything
we
know
that
the
legislature
of
mississippi
in
1942
provided
textbook
aid
for
segregated
academies
or
for
segregated
schools,
at
that
time
they
were
public.
this
was
reminiscent
of
the
problem
faced
in
brown
versus
board
of
education
where
we
had
no
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
revealed
the
intention
of
congress
with
regard
to
public
education.
in
fact,
there
was
no
public
education,
said
the
court
in
brown,
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
given
that
fact,
the
court
had
to
move
to
other
considerations
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
so,
we
have
a
statute
passed
in
1942
before
the
problem
arose
and
the
question
of
purpose
cannot
be
pursued
in
the
same
way
that
we
would
pursue
purpose
with
the
specific
facts
available.
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
in
1942,
no
sir.
in
19
--
well,
in
1942,
we
had
a
dual
school
system
which
was
lawful.
in
1972,
we
have
a
dual
school
system
that
is
unlawful.
now,
what
is
true,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
statute
and
in
terms
of
the
black
children
of
mississippi
and
this
reminiscent
of
a
woman
--
reminiscent
of
woman
in
power,
it
is
of
no
consolation
to
the
black
children
of
mississippi
or
the
black
population
of
mississippi
that
the
legislature
in
1942
did
not
intend
to
promote
segregation.
the
fact
is,
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
promote
segregation
and
that
promotion
of
segregation
is
the
gravamen
of
our
complaint.
it
is
of
no
consolation
to
the
black
children
that
the
state
does
not
intend
to
do
something
when
the
evil
is
there.
now,
again
on
this
first
amendment
or
this
religion
issue
versus
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue,
in
green
versus
kennedy,
another
three-judge
district
court
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
federal
tax
exemption
benefits
to
the
private
academies
of
mississippi,
the
same
private
academies.
i
remind
the
court
that
a
tax
exemption
was
an
indirect
benefit
to
these
private
academies,
there
was
significantly
less
support
for
racial
discrimination
in
mississippi’s
textbook
statute.
here
we
have
a
direct
grant
of
at
least
a
half
a
million
dollars,
or
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
annually
and
yet,
the
three
judge
district
court
affirmed
by
this
court
held
that
tax
exemption
is
only
minimal
and
remote
involvement
when
compared
to
the
kind
of
identification
in
support
of
religion
prohibited
by
the
establishment
clause.
but
the
governmental
and
constitutional
interest
of
avoiding
racial
discrimination
in
educational
institutions
embraces
the
interest
to
be
--
or
precludes
even
indirect
economic
benefit
to
racial
discrimination.
again,
it’s
juxtaposition
of
the
requirements
of
the
religion
clauses
versus
the
requirement
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
are
of
the
clear
view
that
the
proper
standard
for
reviewing
state
support
for
racially
discriminatory
educational
institutions
can
be
found
in
cooper
versus
aaron.
there,
this
court
held
that
state
support
for
racial
discrimination
through
any
arrangement,
through
any
management
or
any
fund
is
violative
of
equal
protection.
when
the
state
of
mississippi
provides
textbook
aid
and
places
itself
behind
the
racial
discrimination,
and
in
effect
or
in
fact
incurred
this
racial
discrimination,
it
violates
cooper
versus
aaron.
and
our
second
basic
theory
is
that
under
the
principles
of
green
versus
new
kent
county,
virginia,
the
state
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
promote
racially
integrated
education,
that
given
its
support
for
racial
discrimination
in
the
dual
school
system
in
the
past,
it
is
duty
bound
today
to
remove
itself
entirely
from
racial
discrimination.
indeed,
it
has
a
duty
to
quarantine
racial
discrimination.
anything
less
than
that
would
be
violative
of
green
versus
new
kent
county,
virginia.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
have
conducted
--
we
--
extensive
discovery
in
this
case.
we
have
104
deposition
in
--
depositions
in
evidence.
we
believe
that
we’ve
already
made
a
record
against
all
148
academies.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor.
indeed
we
have
and
part
of
the
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
that
they’re
segregate
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
we
have
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
some
have
--
some
school
administrators,
private
school
administrators
testified
that
they
had
an
open
enrollment
policy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor.
they’re
a
handful
of
such
disputes.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
we
believe
that
the
district
courts
concerned
and
confronted
with
private
academies
in
mississippi
have
already
held
that
all
of
these
academies
by
segregationist
institutions
that
question
of
fact.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor
in
--
well,
by
implication
in
this
case,
the
extensive
findings
of
fact
were
not
made
in
this
case,
but
in
other
cases,
in
coffey
i
and
coffey
ii,
in
green
versus
kennedy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
by
implication
it
did.
it
found
that
they
are
racially
segregated
and
it
considered
the
issue
before
the
court
as
framed
by
the
assumption
that
they
were
racially
segregated
and
segregationists
that
is
they
had
a
closed
admissions
policy
that
blacks
would
be
excluded.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
it
didn’t
make
that
specific
finding.
it
assumed
it
for
the
purpose
of
argument,
they
held
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
on
remand,
i
believe
the
district
court
could
look
at
each
school
and
find
in
the
record
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
they
were
segregationists.
now,
this
case
involved
the
taking
of
numerous
depositions
of
private
school
administrators
who
had
an
ample
opportunity
to
intervene
and
protect
their
interests.
no
such
private
academy
intervened.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
that’s
correct
but
at
the
same
time,
the
evidence
showed
that
they
were
formed
at
critical
moments
in
critical
school
districts
and
that,
they
were
in
fact
segregated
schools.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
i
believe,
i’ll
give
you
the
exact
figure.
all
students
are
white
except
for
15
chinese.
this
is
what
school
officials
said.
this
appears
at
footnote
3
of
appendix
a
of
page
1a.
all
students
and
all
faculty
members
are
white
except
for
15
chinese,
16
orientals,
two
indians
and
two
latin
americans.
that’s
out
of
a
total
of
42,000
children.
there’s
not
a
single
black
child
in
any
of
these
academies.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
one
or
two.
not
prior
to
brown.
yes,
one
or
two
prior
to
brown,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
now,
they
could’ve
been
founded
prior
to
brown
and
after
green
and
alexander
expanded
their
program
to
accommodate
whites
who
were
plain
public
integrated
schools
and
to
the
extent
that
they
opened
their
doors,
added
facilities,
added
grades,
they
would
be
demonstrating
that
they’re
segregationist
and
undermining
public
integrated
education
and
should
therefore
be
subject
to
an
injunctive
order
prohibiting
textbook
aid
to
them.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
certainly
possible.
again,
we’re
not
claiming
that
all
private
schools
should
not
receive
textbooks.
our
claim
is
that
a
specific
type
of
private
academy
should
not
be
receiving
that.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
it’s
a
private
school
formed
for
the
purpose
or
having
the
effect
of
providing
white
students
with
an
alternative
to
public
integrated
education.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
sir.
not
necessarily.
it
would
be
true
of
virtually
every
private
school
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
but
i’m
referring
to
the
questions
raised
by
mr.
justice
powell
about
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
they
wouldn’t
be
covered,
your
honor.
you
see,
the
academy
i’m
speaking
of
had
substantially
expanded
its
enrollment
at
key
moments
and
these
are
--
in
other
words,
an
academy
formed
in
1945
which
enrolled
200
pupils
and
served
grades
one
through
four,
through
the
year
1968,
green.
and
then
in
1968,
expanded
its
enrollment
to
1000
white
students
and
served
grades
one
through
12
would
be
a
school
which
was
undermining
public
integrated
education.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
i’m
talking
about
an
effect
principle
which
i’m
prepared
to
limit
to
a
formal
--
formally
de
jure
school
system
or
state
which
operated
a
de
jure
system
of
public
school,
de
jure
segregated
system
of
public
education
which
subsequently
--
subsequent
to
the
integral
--
substantial
integration
of
schools
experienced
a
loss,
a
substantial
loss
of
white
pupils
who
are
presently
attending
the
segregated
academy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
an
open
admissions
policy
would
return
the
state
to
freedom
of
choice.
the
classic
example
in
the
city
of
jackson
where
we
have
lost
40,000,
excuse
me,
40%
of
the
white
students,
we
have
white
citizen's
council
schools
assuming
that
the
white
citizens
council
adopted
an
open
admissions
policy
and
let’s
assume
further
that
the
very
remote
possibility
that
blacks
would
attend
the
white
citizen’s
council
school
came
to
pass,
we
would
have
the
white
citizens
council
still
undermining
public
integrated
education.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor.
i’m
saying
that
if
that
what
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i’m
saying
that
if
they
want
to
go
to
private
schools,
they
ought
to
do
so
without
state’s
support.(voice
overlap)
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
(voice
overlap)
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
sir?
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor
we
agree
with
that
distinction
the
court
makes.
however,
what
we’re
trying
to
get
out
is
subterfuge,
alleged
policies
of
open
admissions.
now
in
the
green
versus
kennedy
case,
a
three-judge
district
court
established
a
series
of
requirements
that
private
schools
would
have
to
satisfy
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
tax
exempt
status.
the
record
shows,
according
to
commissioner
thrower
that
there
are
five
or
six
academies
which
have
qualified
for
tax
exemption
which
by
--
which
only
the
most
naive
would
consider
truly
open.
the
indianola
academy
for
example
has
satisfied
the
requirements
of
green
versus
kennedy.
the
indianola
academy
is
presently
a
tax
exempt
institution.
if
you
look
at
our
brief,
page
18,
you
will
find
an
analysis
of
what
occurred
in
the
indianola
school
district.
the
indianola
academy
presently
enrolls
all
white
children
residing
in
the
municipality
of
indianola
and
that
academy’s
enrollment
tripled
in
the
middle
of
the
school
year
immediately
upon
this
court's
decision
in
alexander
versus
holmes
county.
now
we
submit
that
what
we’re
really
getting
at
here
in
trying
to
establish
a
standard
for
a
private
academy
is
to
be
certain
that
the
standard
of
proof
of
open
admissions
is
very,
very
high
that
there
is
no
excuse
for
irs’
approval
of
the
indianola
academy
as
a
school
with
an
open
admissions
policy.
according
to
irs
data,
there
are
at
least
ten
schools
which
are
clearly
segregationists
which
are
presently
tax
exempt
not
withstanding
green
versus
kennedy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor,
one
of
them
is
indianola
academy.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i’m
saying
that
as
long
--
we
agree
with
the
court's
distinction
that
a
school
can
be
in
fact
segregated
and
not
be
segregationist.
at
the
same
time,
we
ask
the
court
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor,
we
concede
that.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
we
view
that
as
the
standard
of
proof
that
ought
to
be
required
of
the
school
like
the
indianola
academy.
if
the
indianola
academy
says
it
has
an
--
it
says
has
an
open
admissions
policy,
it
ought
to
prove
it
not
with
merely
the
policy
but
with
an
integrated
student
body
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no.
i
think
we’ve
got
to
read
that
requirement
in
conjunction
with
other
historical
data.
you
see
we
have
a
network
of
private
schools
in
mississippi
which
were
formed
at
a
critical
moment
or
which
expanded
enrollment
at
a
critical
moment
and
i’m
referring
to
a
standard
to
be
applied
to
such
academies.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that’s
what
we
requested.
however
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that’s
right.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
that’s
correct
and
in
fact
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
oh!
no
sir,
by
no
means,
by
no
means.
now
we
want
to
make
it
clear
that
our
objective
is
to
eliminate
textbook
aid
to
segregationist
academies
or
segregated
academies.
the
question
of
what
standard
should
be
applied
to
determine
what
is
a
segregated
academy
is
not
essential
to
our
lawsuit
by
no
means.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
conceive
--
yes
your
honor,
conceivably.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no
sir.
we
are
recognizing
in
this
litigation
the
right
of
children
to
attend
segregated
schools.
we
are
challenging
their
right
to
attend
such
schools
with
state
aid.
that’s
the
thrust
of
our
lawsuit.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
it’s
conjectural.
it’s
just
as
the
defendants
suggest
that
it
means
that
they’re
not
important.
i
could
suggest
one
that
several
academies
receive
textbooks
until
recently
and
in
anticipation
of
this
lawsuit
decided,
it
would
be
best
to
withdraw
from
the
program
to
avoid
the
shock
of
an
adverse
decision.
so
that
--
why
these
41
schools
don’t
participate
would
be
--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor
the
--
a
school
which
grows
dependent
upon
a
particular
type
of
aid
might
be
reluctant
to
wait
for
a
decision
of
this
court
which
they
believe
would
be
adverse
to
withdraw
from
the
program.
in
fact
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
that
any
private
school
has
stated
that
the
textbooks
are
unnecessary
or
undesirable.
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
on
the
other
on
why
these
schools
do
not
receive
the
textbooks.
