justice
potter
stewart
mr.
leventhal,
your
prayer
for
relief
is
for
a
judgment
of
reversal
and
a
remand
of
the
case
with
instructions
to
enter
an
order
enjoining
the
appellees
from
distributing
textbooks
to
the
private
segregated
academies
of
mississippi.
and
i
notice
in
your
footnote
six
on
page
seven
of
your
brief,
you
set
out
the
fact
that
there
were
202
private
schools
operating
in
mississippi
during
the
1970-71
school
years
and
you
could
see
that
47
of
them,
being
the
catholic
schools
and
seven
others
being
the
special
schools,
i
guess,
for
handicapped
people
and
so
on
are
not,
although
private,
they’re
not
segregated?
justice
potter
stewart
that
seems
to
leave
about
148
that
you
claim
are
segregated
but
that
the
--
i
gather
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
say,
“well,
no
they’re
not.
they’re
just
--
the
tuition
is
high
and
they
happen
to
be
all
white,
but
they’re
not
segregated
schools.”
would
it
be
your
thought
that
with
respect
to
each
one
of
these
148,
there
had
--
there
would
have
to
be
a
separate
hearing
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
one
by
one
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
about
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
held
that
even
on
the
hypothesis
or
the
assumption
that
they
were
segregated,
nonetheless,
this
was
a
constitutionally
valid
action
on
the
part
of
the
state.
but
if
we
should
hold
in
agreement
with
you
that
to
the
extent
they
are
segregated,
it’s
not
constitutionally
valid
then
wouldn’t
it
be
necessary
to
look
at
each
school?
justice
potter
stewart
but
several
of
them
did
say
in
your
pretrial
discovery
that,
“no,
we’re
not
segregated.
we’re
high
priced,
but
we’re
not
segregated.”
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
you
define
that
type?
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
true
about
any
private
school,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
assume
a
private
school
has
been
existence
for
50
years,
that’s
very,
very
high
priced
and
that’s
always
been
all
white,
but
which
would
welcome,
in
fact,
would
welcome
and
be
delighted
to
have
negro
students.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
question.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you,
referring
to
page
--
to
the
complaint
which
starts
on
page
19
of
the
appendix
in
paragraph
two
on
page
19.
you
said
i
--
what
you're
seeking
which
is
a
temporary
restraining
order
on
--
to
prevent
the
sale
or
distribution
to
private
racially
segregated
schools
on
the
counties
and
then
over
on
page
22
when
you
set
down
the
--
your
prayer
for
relief,
you
were
asked
for
an
injunction
against
the
distribution
of
textbooks
to
students
in
schools
unless
those
schools
first
established
that
the
private
school
is
racially
integrated
both
as
to
students
and
faculty.
now
to
me,
those
mean
two
separate
things.
in
other
words,
i
should
suppose
that
a
school
could
in
fact
have
nothing,
but
negro
children
and
yet
not
be
a
segregated
school,
but
certainly
it
would
not
be
an
integrated
school.
a
school
could
in
fact
have
nothing
but
white
children
and
yet
it
could
--
it
might
not
be
a
segregated
school
although
clearly
it
would
not
be
an
integrated
school.
to
me
those
are
two
quite,
one
is
different
concept
from
the
other
and
they
both
appear
here
in
your
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
in
mississippi?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
ten
but
you
talked
about
a
107?
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
be
in
fact
all
negro
or
all
white
and
yet
have
an
open
permissions
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
do
you
understand
in
the
meaning
of
racially
integrated
both
as
to
students
and
faculty,
to
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
have
what,
how
many?
has
to
have
at
least
some
students
and
some
faculty
of
both
races,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
some,
is
that
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
this
true
about
not
only
on
the
indianola
academy
but
everyone
of
the
private
schools
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
no
matter
how
long
they’ve
been
there
and
how
well
established
their
policy
might
be?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
