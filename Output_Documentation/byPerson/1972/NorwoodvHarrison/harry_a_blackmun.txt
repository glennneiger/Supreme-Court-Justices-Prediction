mr.
leventhal,
if
this
aid
were
withdrawn
or
outlawed,
is
it
your
thought
these
academies
would
collapse?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
the
aid
amount
to
per
pupil?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
think
this
would
prompt
a
pupil
to
go
back
into
the
public
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
what
would
happen
if
the
aid
was
withdrawn?
would
the
parents
have
to
buy
the
books
for
the
youngsters?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
as
one
who
is
old
enough
to
remember
that
i
had
to
buy
my
own
books
all
the
time,
i
wonder
how
much
fact
the
six
dollars
per
pupil
per
year
is
even
in
mississippi?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
isn’t
it
distributing
it
to
the
children
rather
than
to
the
schools?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
don’t
we
have
cases
here
that
have
upheld
the
supply
of
textbook
aid
to
pupils
attending
parochial
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
leventhal,
am
i
correct,
is
there
not
in
the
record
an
intimation
that
some
41
schools
did
not
participate
in
this
textbook
program?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
of
any
significance?
do
you
know
why
were
they
denominational
schools
for
instance
supported
something
else
or
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
kind
of
a
shock,
not
the
financial
one
certainly?
