the

(voice

just

they
are

they

they

(inaudible)
justice

let
me
make
sure
of
what
your
position
is.
let's
assume
that
you
do
have
some
schools
where
--
that
do
not
have
an
open
admission
policy,
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
not
the
question
in
this
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don’t
you
think
that
question
fairly
subsumes
the
idea
that
the
--
at
the
very
least
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violated
in
connection
with
those
schools,
if
any
which
do
have
a
closed
admission
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let’s
assume
that
we
didn’t
agree
with
you
and
that
it
does
subsume
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
with
respect
to
schools
if
any
that
has
a
closed
admission
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
find
anything
in
the
allen
case
that
indicated
the
schools
there
had
a
closed
admission
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
you
read
--
if
you
read
the
argument
further
advanced
in
lemon
against
kurtzman.
justice
byron
r.
white
about
closed
admission
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
district
court
held
it
irrelevant
anyway
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
you're
objecting
to,
let
say,
the
district
court
said
the
–
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
they
have
an
open
policy
or
closed
policy,
books
can
go
to
any
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
holding?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now,
if
let’s
assume
we
did
not
agree
with
that
holding,
are
you
asking
us
to
say
that
on
the
other
--
there
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
that
it's
irrelevant
whether
any
of
these
schools
have
an
open
admission
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
in
order
that
a
district
court
in
order
to
keep
an
order,
an
integration
order
from
being
frustrated
that
order
children
not
to
move
to
a
private
school
even
it
had
an
open
policy?
