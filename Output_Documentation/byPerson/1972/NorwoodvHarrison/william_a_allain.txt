mr.
william
a.
allain
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
we
should
first
realize
what
we
do
have
in
this
lawsuit
and
what
we
do
not
have
in
the
lawsuit.
i
direct
the
court's
or
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
appendix
at
page
19
which
contains
the
complaint
of
a
lawsuit.
the
second
paragraph
thereof
the
plaintiff
seek
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
preliminary
and
permanent
injunction,
enjoining
the
defendants
from
providing
or
permitting
the
distribution
or
sale
of
state
purchased
or
owned
textbooks
to
private,
racially
segregated
schools
or
academies.
this
case
is
a
fine
drawn
legal
question.
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
170
challenged
academies
have
a
racially
motivated
admission
policy.
it
is
one
which
deals
basically
with
whether
or
not
the
state
of
mississippi
can
lend
text
books
to
the
pupils
attending
racially
segregated
private
academies
regardless,
regardless
of
how
they
got
that
way.
now
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
appendix,
at
page
22
in
which
the
relief
requested
is
that
before
textbooks
can
be
allowed
to,
here
they
say,
“private
schools
and
all
students,”
there
must
first
be
a
showing
to
the
district
court
that
the
private
school
is
racially
integrated
both
as
to
students
and
faculty
and
in
a
conjunctive,
has
not
have
the
effect
of
frustrating
or
impeding
the
establishment
of
racially
integrated
public
schools.
now
that,
your
honors
is
a
burden
that
no
private
school
in
the
united
states
that
i
believe,
i
know
of
could
carry
which
shows
a
fine
line
which
this
particular
case
takes.
they
are
saying
they
won’t
relieve
to
this
extent,
unless
the
private
schools
now
can
show
that
they
have
an
open
enrollment
admission
policy,
but
that
they
must
be
racially
integrated
both
in
faculty
and
in
students.
mr.
william
a.
allain
if
the
court
please,
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
question
in
this
lawsuit
but
if
we
did
have
that
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
because
the
lawsuit
was
drafted
and
framed
by
the
plaintiffs
and
is
shown
by
the
appellants
brief,
the
question
before
this
court
does
not
deal,
does
not
deal,
does
not
deal
with
what
the
race
--
what
the
admission
policy
of
the
school
is,
it
is
on
the
theory
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
don’t,
except
the
reason
that
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
if
it
will
subsume
that
question
i
think
we
would
still
be
on
solid
ground
with
the
teachings
of
these
court
cases
in
allen
and
the
cochran
case.
mr.
william
a.
allain
that
is
right
your
honor
because
it
is
aid
to
the
pupil
and
not
to
the
school
the
same
rationale
of
the
allen
case,
the
cochran
case
out
of
louisiana,
1930
dealing
with
textbook.
the
allen
case
by
your
honor
you
wrote
that
of
--
of
that
opinion
in
1960.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
but
the
rationale
there
did
not
deal
with
the
--
whether
or
not
the
admission
policy
was
closed
or
open,
the
rationale
as
i
understand
allen
and
i
hate
to
debate
with
the
author
of
the
opinion
but
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
went
to
the
pupil
and
not
to
the
student.
mr.
william
a.
allain
yes
your
honor
you
did.
mr.
william
a.
allain
right.
but
i
--
the
rationale
of
the
allen
case
if
we
understand,
the
cochran
case,
mississippi’s
chance
case,
the
--
all
the
cases
that
--
the
transportation
case
is
that
it
is
aid
to
the
pupil
and
the
student
or
the
parent
and
not
to
the
school.
mr.
william
a.
allain
now,
i
say
that
i
do
not
to
believe
the
issues
framed
here
or
is
brought
as
your
honor
addresses
himself
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
is
no
proof
in
this
case.
no
attempted
proof
by
the
plaintiff
to
show
what
the
particular
admission
policy
was
of
the
107
academies.
in
fact,
the
proof
is
just
the
opposite
shown
by
cross-examination
by
the
defendants
that
that
did
have,
the
107
have
an
open
enrollment
policy.
it
is
either
on
the
minutes,
it
is
oral,
verbal
and
sometimes
it
went
so
far
as
be
advertised
in
the
newspapers.
so
i
think
from
the
fact
that
the
case
in
the
lower
court
was
not
tried
on
that
issue.
there
was
no
attempt
to
show
by
the
plaintiffs
that
that
was
a
closed
admission
policy.
this
case
is
drawn
on
the
same
fine
lines
of
the
tuition
cases
in
which
the
courts
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
racially
segregated,
not
how
they
got
there,
but
that
is
a
different
rationale,
a
different
principle.
for
the
simple
reason
in
the
tuition
cases,
the
coffey
i,
coffey
ii,
the
poindexter
cases,
griffin
case
found
that
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
state
of
louisiana
and
virginia
were
operating
not
necessarily
racially
discriminatory
white
academies,
but
they
had
in
one
--
they're
still
operating
a
dual
school
system
because
in
that
case,
under
i
guess
the
under
the
rationale
of
burton
case,
the
sifting
of
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
show
that
they
were
actually
in
partnership
with
the
private
schools.
the
tuition
was
the
basic
income
of
the
private
schools.
so
instead
of
having
an
allen
case
or
instead
of
even
having
a
burton
case,
you
had
a
brown
and
griffin
case
which
did
not
depend
upon
a
finding
by
the
court
that
there
was
an
open
or
a
closed
admission
policies
for
--
as
the
private
school
were
concerned
because
of
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
predominantly
white,
put
the
state
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
in
operating
a
dual
school
system
again
under
the
freedom
of
choice.
now
we
say
to
the
court
that
we
think
that
this
case
regardless
of
how
it
is
taken
is
controlled
by
the
line
of
cases
of
allen
and
cochran,
the
transportation
and
textbook
cases
and
the
plaintiffs
try
to
get
past
the
rationale
and
holding
in
those
cases
by
saying,
“well
this
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
and
not
a
first
amendment.”
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
first
amendment,
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment,
now
i
know
mr.
chief
justice
has
spoke
in
the
tilton
about
the
internal
tension
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
exercise
clause.
but
the
establishment
clause
has
been
held
by
this
court
as
absolute.
the
exercise
clause
is
not
absolute
as
to
actions
of
individuals
and
that’s
in
the
jacobs
case
which
allowed
inoculations
and
i
think
the
prince
case
against
massachusetts
was
the
labor,
the
child
labor.
but
you
are
talking
about
an
absolute
in
the
establishment
clause
and
therefore
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
measuring
stick
for
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
is
more
stringent
and
more
stringent
than
that
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
whose
contours
as
this
court
has
said
have
not
been
concretely
established
to
allow
for
flexibility.
the
measuring
stick
apparently
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
cases
would
be
the
burton
case
where
we
must
sift
the
facts
and
look
at
the
circumstances
to
see
whether
or
not
a
state
has
put
itself
in
partnership
with
the
academies.
and
counsel
and
the
plaintiffs
go
further
and
say
“yes”
but
you
are
not
controlled
by
burton
for
the
simple
reason.
green
and
swan
say
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
an
affirmative
duty.
so
it
is
actually
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
per
se
which
the
plaintiffs
are
riding
in
this
particular
case.
it’s
the
first
amendment
with
the
gloss
put
up
on
it
by
swan
and
green
upon
any
state
which
has
had
a
dual
school
system.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor,
there
is
no,
the
only
benefits
given
by
the
state
to
any
individual,
enrolled
in
a
private
school
are
the
textbooks.
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
think
that
they
could
your
honor.
under
the
rationale
of
the
new
jersey
case
which
held
--
of
course
the
everson
case
which
it
held
that
transportation
did
not
violate
the
establishment
clause
in
the
new
jersey
case.
but
the
affirmative
duty
doctrine
is
--
has
never
been
completely
defined
by
this
court.
how
far
does
a
state
have
to
go
in
order
to
do
away
with
any,
anything
which
interferes
as
the
plaintiffs
say
that
the
academies
interfere
with
the
unitary
school
system
in
mississippi.
that
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
the
plaintiff’s
are
asking
and
are
saying
that
the
state
can
give
no
aid.
now
that
taken
to
its
illogical
logical
extension
would
be
that
they
must
cut
off
water,
sewer,
electricity.
now,
i
know
this
sounds
absurd
because
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
moose
lodge
case
and
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
lemon
case
and
mr.
brennan
in
the
concurring
of
the
lemon
case
stated
that
this
were
benefits
which
could
flow
to
private
schools,
to
church
schools
or
anything
else.
but
if
we
take
this
affirmative
duty
that
the
plaintiffs
are
tempting
to
urge
upon
the
court,
then
how
far
is
it
necessary
for
the
state
of
mississippi
or
louisiana
or
any
other
state
to
go
to
get
rid
of
what
they
say
are
the
private
segregated
schools
regardless
of
how
they
get
there
which
is
interfering
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor,
maybe
it
could
stop
there,
i
would
not,
what
i
am
saying
to
the
court
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
that
is
what
is
in
this
case,
but
that
is
not
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
what
is
requested
in
this
case
does
because
of
the
rationale
and
what
this
case
would
stand
for.
in
the
affirmative
duty
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
do
not
because
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
--
then
you
would
get
into
transportation
and
then
you
would
get
into
whether
or
not
private
schools
should
be
charted
in
mississippi.
you
would
get
into
whether
or
not
that
the
universities
of
mississippi
should
accept
the
credits
from
these
private
schools.
you
would
get
in
to
all
types
of
aid,
if
you
want
to
call
it
aid
which
is
being
given
to
private
schools
in
which
they
are
participating
in.
i
don’t
see
any
of
decision
in
this
case
could
be
so
limited.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
said
it
had
a
fine
line
drawn
as
far
as
a
factual
situation
and
because
of
that
fine
line
as
to
factual
situation,
it
would
make
any
decision
adverse
to
the
state
a
broad
holding.
the
fine
line
of
facts
makes
the
holding
broader
than
is
the
facts
were
brought
up
then
you
might
be
able
to
this
--
to
limit
the
holding.
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
are
asking
for
an
underlining
that
any
aid
given
to
the
107
private
schools
should
be
cutoff
and
when
i
say
any
aid,
let
us
take
for
instance
a
really
absurdity
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
i’m
not
too
sure
that
it’s
in
the
complaint,
but
it
permeates
throughout
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
did
not
intend
to
say
we
were
limited
to
the
complaint.
i
merely
intended
to
say
that
the
factual
situation
is
framed
by
the
state.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
was
--
the
relief
--
now
in
the
relief,
the
relief
does
state.
as
you
read
in
the
relief
it
does
go
further
and
talks
about
until
racially
integrated
both
as
to
students
and
faculty.
that
is
on
page
22
of
the
appendix.
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
it
is
speaking
here
that
unless
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
that
is
the
request
at
this
time.
it
is
not
--
is
not
beyond
the
scope
to
see
the
next
lawsuit
that
would
be
before
this
court
citing
this
case
as
authority.
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
what
i’m
saying
to
the
court
is
though
because
of
the
fine
factual
situation
the
decision
in
this
court
would
precipitate
immediately
another
lawsuit
as
to
any
other
aid
which
was
given
to
these
private
schools.
plus
the
fact
that
if
and
i
think
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
stewart
said
yesterday
that
maybe
this
could
go
back
and
what
the
determination
have
to
be
made
as
to
each
particular
school,
it
could
not
be
made
on
this
record
sir.
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
said
the
only
aid
that
were
given
to
students
attending
private
schools
in
mississippi
was
the
textbook.
mr.
william
a.
allain
sir?
mr.
william
a.
allain
that
is
all
before
you
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
i
do
not
think
and
i
do
not
want
to
argue
with
the
--
your
honor
only
is
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
advisory
opinion
which
in
it
--
it
is
an
opinion
in
which
a
later
suit,
a
later
case
can
be
built
on
for
the
simple
reason
of
what
the
holding
would
be
in
this
particular
case
that
regardless
of
how
these
107
academies
came
about,
regardless
of
whether
they
had
an
open
enrollment
policy
or
not
unless
they
were
racially
integrated
and
i
don’t
know
how
you
get
a
private
school
racially
integrated
anywhere
in
america
because
its
a
choice
by
these
pupils.
it
is
usually
a
tuition
that
they
have
to
pay
and
the
people
go
there
because
of
their
choice.
i
do
not
know
how
that
anyone
could
carry
the
burden
with
this
type
of
decision
by
the
court
would
establish.
so
we
say
to
the
court
that
even
under
the
affirmative
duty
doctrine
as
the
court
addressed
itself
to
in
swan
where
the
courts
recognized
that
even
under
this
we
are
--
the
equity
power
of
the
court
is
limited
in
what
it
can
do.
that
they
cannot
ride
that
doctrine
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
these
107
schools
regardless,
regardless
of
their
policy
of
admission,
regardless
of
how
they
became
into
being,
regardless
to
how
they
are
supported,
are
not
the
pupils
attending
are
not
entitled
to
textbooks.
and
remember
this
textbook
law
came
into
being
in
1940
rather
than
1942.
it
was
amended
in
1942
to
bring
in
high
schools.
it
came
during
a
depression.
it
came
with
the
benevolence
of
the
state
in
order
to
help
not
only
not
just
white
children
in
mississippi,
but
black
and
white
children
who
were
attending
public
and
private
schools.
in
fact
i
dare
say
that
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
do
not
know
about
that
your
honor,
i
do
know
that
for
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
i
said
as
to
public,
its
public
education
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
--
the
typically,
textbook
went
to
public
and
private
schools
and
i
dare
say
that
the
black
community,
knowing
mississippi
as
i
do
that
the
effect
upon
the
pocketbook
was
of
more
value
probably
at
that
time
to
the
black
parent
than
it
was
to
the
white
parent.
now
the
inconsistency
in
the
argument
made
by
the
plaintiffs
is
the
fact
that
they
want
to
exclude
from
this
holding,
one
that
catholic
schools
in
mississippi,
why?
why
do
they
have
something
like
12,000
students,
10,000
whites
and
well,
two
to
two-and-half
black?
there
is
no
showing
that
they
are
integrated.
in
fact
the
record
will
probably
show
they're
predominantly
segregated.
so
if
this
type
of
academy
is
what
they
are
oppressing
on
the
court,
what
makes
any
difference
whether
or
not
it’s
the
catholic
schools?
they
had
excluded
two,
i
think,
predominant
black
schools.
why
exclude
them,
aren't
they
taking
out
of
the
system
pupils
who
should
be
back
into
public
schools?
they’ve
excluded
other
academies,
i
think
five
other
academies.
so
why
is
there
an
inclusion
to
be
consistent
with
the
principle
that
the
plaintiffs
are
attempting
to
urge
upon
this
court?
these
academies,
these
academies
are
doing
the
same
thing
as
the
107
academies
would
say
are
trying
--
they
challenge
in
this
particular
lawsuit.
we
say
to
the
court
that
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1940
without
any
racial
motives.
it
in
no
way
established
any
dual
school
system
and
it
no
way
established
any
racially
segregated
private
schools.
it
has
been
even
handedly
executed
throughout
the
years.
i
would
further
say
to
the
court
that
there
is
one
finding
by
this
court,
by
the
district
court
which
we
think
that
unless
it's
manifestly
wrong,
this
court
should
affirm
and
this
court
i
think
has
been
on
record
since
the
brown
decision
in
saying
the
district
court
and
the
trial
court
is
a
court
that
must
look
at
the
factual
situation.
this
court
recently
said
in
the
right
case,
gave
great
weight
to
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
and
one
of
the
findings
in
that
case,
the
third
finding
i
believe
said
that
we
look
at
the
timing,
when
was
this
new
school
system
created?
there’s
no
timing
problem
in
this
particular
case
because
it
was
way
back
in
1940.
the
district
court
found
in
its
opinion
that
since
the
issuance
of
free
textbooks
to
students
attending
private
schools
has
failed
to
defeat
the
establishment
of
a
statewide
unitary
school
system
in
mississippi
and
since
plaintiffs
are
themselves
receiving
their
free
textbook,
there
is
serious
question
as
to
whether
plaintiffs
are
threatened
with
the
irreparable
injury
which
is
requisite
to
injunctive
relief.
further
the
court
found
there
is
no
showing
that
any
child
enrolled
in
private
schools,
is
deprived
of
free
textbooks
would
withdraw
from
private
school
and
subsequently
enroll
into
public
schools
now
unitary.
further
there
is
a
finding
by
the
court
in
the
evidence
in
the
lower
court,
i
mean
in
the
depositions
that
the
withdrawal
from
the
pupils
of
this
particular
aid
would
not
in
anyway
which
is
just
$6.00
a
year
per
pupil
substantially
effect
the
107
private
schools
which
are
under
attack
in
this
particular
lawsuit.
we
say
to
the
court
in
closing
that
we
feel
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
bottomed
on
the
facts
in
that
particular
case
and
the
law
has
been
the
teachings
of
this
court.
and
that
even
in
the
two
poindexter
cases
which
this
court
affirmed,
judge
wisdom
speaking
for
the
district
court
in
similar
situations
in
louisiana
that
had
a
dual
school
system
in
tuition
cases,
distinguished
those
particular
cases
from
textbooks
and
free
luncheon
and
the
other
benevolent
gifts
that
had
been
given
to
charitable
and
educational
institutions
throughout
the
years.
we
say
to
the
court
we
think
this
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
don’t
recall
your
honor
the
percentage.
i
do
recall
there
was
a
thousand
different
schools
involved
in
it
and
only
35,000
in
the
private
school,
but
i’m
not
sure
of
the
particular
breakdown
of
the
--
population
of
mississippi
breakdown
is
something
like
60:40
of
the
1970
census
or
62:38.
i
am
not
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
total
population
breakdown
white
to
black.
i
would
think
that
the
school
enrollment
maybe
somewhat
above
that.
it
might
be
a
60:40
or
55:45.
mr.
william
a.
allain
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
we
should
first
realize
what
we
do
have
in
this
lawsuit
and
what
we
do
not
have
in
the
lawsuit.
i
direct
the
court's
or
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
appendix
at
page
19
which
contains
the
complaint
of
a
lawsuit.
the
second
paragraph
thereof
the
plaintiff
seek
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
preliminary
and
permanent
injunction,
enjoining
the
defendants
from
providing
or
permitting
the
distribution
or
sale
of
state
purchased
or
owned
textbooks
to
private,
racially
segregated
schools
or
academies.
this
case
is
a
fine
drawn
legal
question.
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
170
challenged
academies
have
a
racially
motivated
admission
policy.
it
is
one
which
deals
basically
with
whether
or
not
the
state
of
mississippi
can
lend
text
books
to
the
pupils
attending
racially
segregated
private
academies
regardless,
regardless
of
how
they
got
that
way.
now
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
appendix,
at
page
22
in
which
the
relief
requested
is
that
before
textbooks
can
be
allowed
to,
here
they
say,
“private
schools
and
all
students,”
there
must
first
be
a
showing
to
the
district
court
that
the
private
school
is
racially
integrated
both
as
to
students
and
faculty
and
in
a
conjunctive,
has
not
have
the
effect
of
frustrating
or
impeding
the
establishment
of
racially
integrated
public
schools.
now
that,
your
honors
is
a
burden
that
no
private
school
in
the
united
states
that
i
believe,
i
know
of
could
carry
which
shows
a
fine
line
which
this
particular
case
takes.
they
are
saying
they
won’t
relieve
to
this
extent,
unless
the
private
schools
now
can
show
that
they
have
an
open
enrollment
admission
policy,
but
that
they
must
be
racially
integrated
both
in
faculty
and
in
students.
mr.
william
a.
allain
if
the
court
please,
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
question
in
this
lawsuit
but
if
we
did
have
that
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
because
the
lawsuit
was
drafted
and
framed
by
the
plaintiffs
and
is
shown
by
the
appellants
brief,
the
question
before
this
court
does
not
deal,
does
not
deal,
does
not
deal
with
what
the
race
--
what
the
admission
policy
of
the
school
is,
it
is
on
the
theory
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
don’t,
except
the
reason
that
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
if
it
will
subsume
that
question
i
think
we
would
still
be
on
solid
ground
with
the
teachings
of
these
court
cases
in
allen
and
the
cochran
case.
mr.
william
a.
allain
that
is
right
your
honor
because
it
is
aid
to
the
pupil
and
not
to
the
school
the
same
rationale
of
the
allen
case,
the
cochran
case
out
of
louisiana,
1930
dealing
with
textbook.
the
allen
case
by
your
honor
you
wrote
that
of
--
of
that
opinion
in
1960.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
but
the
rationale
there
did
not
deal
with
the
--
whether
or
not
the
admission
policy
was
closed
or
open,
the
rationale
as
i
understand
allen
and
i
hate
to
debate
with
the
author
of
the
opinion
but
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
went
to
the
pupil
and
not
to
the
student.
mr.
william
a.
allain
yes
your
honor
you
did.
mr.
william
a.
allain
right.
but
i
--
the
rationale
of
the
allen
case
if
we
understand,
the
cochran
case,
mississippi’s
chance
case,
the
--
all
the
cases
that
--
the
transportation
case
is
that
it
is
aid
to
the
pupil
and
the
student
or
the
parent
and
not
to
the
school.
mr.
william
a.
allain
now,
i
say
that
i
do
not
to
believe
the
issues
framed
here
or
is
brought
as
your
honor
addresses
himself
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
is
no
proof
in
this
case.
no
attempted
proof
by
the
plaintiff
to
show
what
the
particular
admission
policy
was
of
the
107
academies.
in
fact,
the
proof
is
just
the
opposite
shown
by
cross-examination
by
the
defendants
that
that
did
have,
the
107
have
an
open
enrollment
policy.
it
is
either
on
the
minutes,
it
is
oral,
verbal
and
sometimes
it
went
so
far
as
be
advertised
in
the
newspapers.
so
i
think
from
the
fact
that
the
case
in
the
lower
court
was
not
tried
on
that
issue.
there
was
no
attempt
to
show
by
the
plaintiffs
that
that
was
a
closed
admission
policy.
this
case
is
drawn
on
the
same
fine
lines
of
the
tuition
cases
in
which
the
courts
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
racially
segregated,
not
how
they
got
there,
but
that
is
a
different
rationale,
a
different
principle.
for
the
simple
reason
in
the
tuition
cases,
the
coffey
i,
coffey
ii,
the
poindexter
cases,
griffin
case
found
that
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
state
of
louisiana
and
virginia
were
operating
not
necessarily
racially
discriminatory
white
academies,
but
they
had
in
one
--
they're
still
operating
a
dual
school
system
because
in
that
case,
under
i
guess
the
under
the
rationale
of
burton
case,
the
sifting
of
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
show
that
they
were
actually
in
partnership
with
the
private
schools.
the
tuition
was
the
basic
income
of
the
private
schools.
so
instead
of
having
an
allen
case
or
instead
of
even
having
a
burton
case,
you
had
a
brown
and
griffin
case
which
did
not
depend
upon
a
finding
by
the
court
that
there
was
an
open
or
a
closed
admission
policies
for
--
as
the
private
school
were
concerned
because
of
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
predominantly
white,
put
the
state
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
in
operating
a
dual
school
system
again
under
the
freedom
of
choice.
now
we
say
to
the
court
that
we
think
that
this
case
regardless
of
how
it
is
taken
is
controlled
by
the
line
of
cases
of
allen
and
cochran,
the
transportation
and
textbook
cases
and
the
plaintiffs
try
to
get
past
the
rationale
and
holding
in
those
cases
by
saying,
“well
this
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
and
not
a
first
amendment.”
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
first
amendment,
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment,
now
i
know
mr.
chief
justice
has
spoke
in
the
tilton
about
the
internal
tension
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
exercise
clause.
but
the
establishment
clause
has
been
held
by
this
court
as
absolute.
the
exercise
clause
is
not
absolute
as
to
actions
of
individuals
and
that’s
in
the
jacobs
case
which
allowed
inoculations
and
i
think
the
prince
case
against
massachusetts
was
the
labor,
the
child
labor.
but
you
are
talking
about
an
absolute
in
the
establishment
clause
and
therefore
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
measuring
stick
for
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
is
more
stringent
and
more
stringent
than
that
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
whose
contours
as
this
court
has
said
have
not
been
concretely
established
to
allow
for
flexibility.
the
measuring
stick
apparently
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
cases
would
be
the
burton
case
where
we
must
sift
the
facts
and
look
at
the
circumstances
to
see
whether
or
not
a
state
has
put
itself
in
partnership
with
the
academies.
and
counsel
and
the
plaintiffs
go
further
and
say
“yes”
but
you
are
not
controlled
by
burton
for
the
simple
reason.
green
and
swan
say
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
an
affirmative
duty.
so
it
is
actually
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
per
se
which
the
plaintiffs
are
riding
in
this
particular
case.
it’s
the
first
amendment
with
the
gloss
put
up
on
it
by
swan
and
green
upon
any
state
which
has
had
a
dual
school
system.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor,
there
is
no,
the
only
benefits
given
by
the
state
to
any
individual,
enrolled
in
a
private
school
are
the
textbooks.
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
think
that
they
could
your
honor.
under
the
rationale
of
the
new
jersey
case
which
held
--
of
course
the
everson
case
which
it
held
that
transportation
did
not
violate
the
establishment
clause
in
the
new
jersey
case.
but
the
affirmative
duty
doctrine
is
--
has
never
been
completely
defined
by
this
court.
how
far
does
a
state
have
to
go
in
order
to
do
away
with
any,
anything
which
interferes
as
the
plaintiffs
say
that
the
academies
interfere
with
the
unitary
school
system
in
mississippi.
that
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
the
plaintiff’s
are
asking
and
are
saying
that
the
state
can
give
no
aid.
now
that
taken
to
its
illogical
logical
extension
would
be
that
they
must
cut
off
water,
sewer,
electricity.
now,
i
know
this
sounds
absurd
because
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
moose
lodge
case
and
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
lemon
case
and
mr.
brennan
in
the
concurring
of
the
lemon
case
stated
that
this
were
benefits
which
could
flow
to
private
schools,
to
church
schools
or
anything
else.
but
if
we
take
this
affirmative
duty
that
the
plaintiffs
are
tempting
to
urge
upon
the
court,
then
how
far
is
it
necessary
for
the
state
of
mississippi
or
louisiana
or
any
other
state
to
go
to
get
rid
of
what
they
say
are
the
private
segregated
schools
regardless
of
how
they
get
there
which
is
interfering
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor,
maybe
it
could
stop
there,
i
would
not,
what
i
am
saying
to
the
court
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
that
is
what
is
in
this
case,
but
that
is
not
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
what
is
requested
in
this
case
does
because
of
the
rationale
and
what
this
case
would
stand
for.
in
the
affirmative
duty
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
do
not
because
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
--
then
you
would
get
into
transportation
and
then
you
would
get
into
whether
or
not
private
schools
should
be
charted
in
mississippi.
you
would
get
into
whether
or
not
that
the
universities
of
mississippi
should
accept
the
credits
from
these
private
schools.
you
would
get
in
to
all
types
of
aid,
if
you
want
to
call
it
aid
which
is
being
given
to
private
schools
in
which
they
are
participating
in.
i
don’t
see
any
of
decision
in
this
case
could
be
so
limited.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
said
it
had
a
fine
line
drawn
as
far
as
a
factual
situation
and
because
of
that
fine
line
as
to
factual
situation,
it
would
make
any
decision
adverse
to
the
state
a
broad
holding.
the
fine
line
of
facts
makes
the
holding
broader
than
is
the
facts
were
brought
up
then
you
might
be
able
to
this
--
to
limit
the
holding.
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
are
asking
for
an
underlining
that
any
aid
given
to
the
107
private
schools
should
be
cutoff
and
when
i
say
any
aid,
let
us
take
for
instance
a
really
absurdity
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
i’m
not
too
sure
that
it’s
in
the
complaint,
but
it
permeates
throughout
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
did
not
intend
to
say
we
were
limited
to
the
complaint.
i
merely
intended
to
say
that
the
factual
situation
is
framed
by
the
state.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no
your
honor
i
was
--
the
relief
--
now
in
the
relief,
the
relief
does
state.
as
you
read
in
the
relief
it
does
go
further
and
talks
about
until
racially
integrated
both
as
to
students
and
faculty.
that
is
on
page
22
of
the
appendix.
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
it
is
speaking
here
that
unless
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
that
is
the
request
at
this
time.
it
is
not
--
is
not
beyond
the
scope
to
see
the
next
lawsuit
that
would
be
before
this
court
citing
this
case
as
authority.
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
what
i’m
saying
to
the
court
is
though
because
of
the
fine
factual
situation
the
decision
in
this
court
would
precipitate
immediately
another
lawsuit
as
to
any
other
aid
which
was
given
to
these
private
schools.
plus
the
fact
that
if
and
i
think
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
stewart
said
yesterday
that
maybe
this
could
go
back
and
what
the
determination
have
to
be
made
as
to
each
particular
school,
it
could
not
be
made
on
this
record
sir.
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
said
the
only
aid
that
were
given
to
students
attending
private
schools
in
mississippi
was
the
textbook.
mr.
william
a.
allain
sir?
mr.
william
a.
allain
that
is
all
before
you
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
i
do
not
think
and
i
do
not
want
to
argue
with
the
--
your
honor
only
is
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
advisory
opinion
which
in
it
--
it
is
an
opinion
in
which
a
later
suit,
a
later
case
can
be
built
on
for
the
simple
reason
of
what
the
holding
would
be
in
this
particular
case
that
regardless
of
how
these
107
academies
came
about,
regardless
of
whether
they
had
an
open
enrollment
policy
or
not
unless
they
were
racially
integrated
and
i
don’t
know
how
you
get
a
private
school
racially
integrated
anywhere
in
america
because
its
a
choice
by
these
pupils.
it
is
usually
a
tuition
that
they
have
to
pay
and
the
people
go
there
because
of
their
choice.
i
do
not
know
how
that
anyone
could
carry
the
burden
with
this
type
of
decision
by
the
court
would
establish.
so
we
say
to
the
court
that
even
under
the
affirmative
duty
doctrine
as
the
court
addressed
itself
to
in
swan
where
the
courts
recognized
that
even
under
this
we
are
--
the
equity
power
of
the
court
is
limited
in
what
it
can
do.
that
they
cannot
ride
that
doctrine
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
these
107
schools
regardless,
regardless
of
their
policy
of
admission,
regardless
of
how
they
became
into
being,
regardless
to
how
they
are
supported,
are
not
the
pupils
attending
are
not
entitled
to
textbooks.
and
remember
this
textbook
law
came
into
being
in
1940
rather
than
1942.
it
was
amended
in
1942
to
bring
in
high
schools.
it
came
during
a
depression.
it
came
with
the
benevolence
of
the
state
in
order
to
help
not
only
not
just
white
children
in
mississippi,
but
black
and
white
children
who
were
attending
public
and
private
schools.
in
fact
i
dare
say
that
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
do
not
know
about
that
your
honor,
i
do
know
that
for
the
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
your
honor
i
said
as
to
public,
its
public
education
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
--
the
typically,
textbook
went
to
public
and
private
schools
and
i
dare
say
that
the
black
community,
knowing
mississippi
as
i
do
that
the
effect
upon
the
pocketbook
was
of
more
value
probably
at
that
time
to
the
black
parent
than
it
was
to
the
white
parent.
now
the
inconsistency
in
the
argument
made
by
the
plaintiffs
is
the
fact
that
they
want
to
exclude
from
this
holding,
one
that
catholic
schools
in
mississippi,
why?
why
do
they
have
something
like
12,000
students,
10,000
whites
and
well,
two
to
two-and-half
black?
there
is
no
showing
that
they
are
integrated.
in
fact
the
record
will
probably
show
they're
predominantly
segregated.
so
if
this
type
of
academy
is
what
they
are
oppressing
on
the
court,
what
makes
any
difference
whether
or
not
it’s
the
catholic
schools?
they
had
excluded
two,
i
think,
predominant
black
schools.
why
exclude
them,
aren't
they
taking
out
of
the
system
pupils
who
should
be
back
into
public
schools?
they’ve
excluded
other
academies,
i
think
five
other
academies.
so
why
is
there
an
inclusion
to
be
consistent
with
the
principle
that
the
plaintiffs
are
attempting
to
urge
upon
this
court?
these
academies,
these
academies
are
doing
the
same
thing
as
the
107
academies
would
say
are
trying
--
they
challenge
in
this
particular
lawsuit.
we
say
to
the
court
that
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1940
without
any
racial
motives.
it
in
no
way
established
any
dual
school
system
and
it
no
way
established
any
racially
segregated
private
schools.
it
has
been
even
handedly
executed
throughout
the
years.
i
would
further
say
to
the
court
that
there
is
one
finding
by
this
court,
by
the
district
court
which
we
think
that
unless
it's
manifestly
wrong,
this
court
should
affirm
and
this
court
i
think
has
been
on
record
since
the
brown
decision
in
saying
the
district
court
and
the
trial
court
is
a
court
that
must
look
at
the
factual
situation.
this
court
recently
said
in
the
right
case,
gave
great
weight
to
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
and
one
of
the
findings
in
that
case,
the
third
finding
i
believe
said
that
we
look
at
the
timing,
when
was
this
new
school
system
created?
there’s
no
timing
problem
in
this
particular
case
because
it
was
way
back
in
1940.
the
district
court
found
in
its
opinion
that
since
the
issuance
of
free
textbooks
to
students
attending
private
schools
has
failed
to
defeat
the
establishment
of
a
statewide
unitary
school
system
in
mississippi
and
since
plaintiffs
are
themselves
receiving
their
free
textbook,
there
is
serious
question
as
to
whether
plaintiffs
are
threatened
with
the
irreparable
injury
which
is
requisite
to
injunctive
relief.
further
the
court
found
there
is
no
showing
that
any
child
enrolled
in
private
schools,
is
deprived
of
free
textbooks
would
withdraw
from
private
school
and
subsequently
enroll
into
public
schools
now
unitary.
further
there
is
a
finding
by
the
court
in
the
evidence
in
the
lower
court,
i
mean
in
the
depositions
that
the
withdrawal
from
the
pupils
of
this
particular
aid
would
not
in
anyway
which
is
just
$6.00
a
year
per
pupil
substantially
effect
the
107
private
schools
which
are
under
attack
in
this
particular
lawsuit.
we
say
to
the
court
in
closing
that
we
feel
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
bottomed
on
the
facts
in
that
particular
case
and
the
law
has
been
the
teachings
of
this
court.
and
that
even
in
the
two
poindexter
cases
which
this
court
affirmed,
judge
wisdom
speaking
for
the
district
court
in
similar
situations
in
louisiana
that
had
a
dual
school
system
in
tuition
cases,
distinguished
those
particular
cases
from
textbooks
and
free
luncheon
and
the
other
benevolent
gifts
that
had
been
given
to
charitable
and
educational
institutions
throughout
the
years.
we
say
to
the
court
we
think
this
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
don’t
recall
your
honor
the
percentage.
i
do
recall
there
was
a
thousand
different
schools
involved
in
it
and
only
35,000
in
the
private
school,
but
i’m
not
sure
of
the
particular
breakdown
of
the
--
population
of
mississippi
breakdown
is
something
like
60:40
of
the
1970
census
or
62:38.
i
am
not
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
total
population
breakdown
white
to
black.
i
would
think
that
the
school
enrollment
maybe
somewhat
above
that.
it
might
be
a
60:40
or
55:45.
