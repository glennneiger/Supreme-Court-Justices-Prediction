mr.

what’s
the
original
date
of
enactment
of
this
textbook
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
been
materially
altered
since
then?
chief

burger
district
council
--
they
already
have
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
the
act
antedated
brown
against
the
board
of
education
by
a
dozen
years
or
how
do
you
think
that
bears
on
the
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
you
think
it
contributed
to
the
maintenance
of
the
dual
system
any
more
or
less
in
1942
than
in
1972?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
there
are
some
evidence
here
about
a
number,
or
perhaps
a
dozen
or
more
orientals
and
others
in
this
academy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
to
pursue
justice
stewart’s
hypothetical,
it
would
demonstrate
that
in
fact
they
had
an
open
admissions
policy
and
would
accept
a
negro
who
could
pay
the
tuition,
would
you
say
that
because
the
effect
was
deleterious,
it
falls
under
this
ban?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
this
point
in
the
morning,

assuming
now,
limiting
my
question
to
