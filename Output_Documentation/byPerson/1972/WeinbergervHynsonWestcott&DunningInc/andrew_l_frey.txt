mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
hynson
cases
numbers
394
and
414
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
holding
that
the
commissioner
acted
improperly
in
withdrawing
approval,
for
instance
product
lutrexin
without
a
hearing.
lutrexin
is
a
drug
product
whose
active
ingredient
lututrin
is
an
extract
from
sow
ovaries.
it's
offered
for
the
treatment
for
dysmenorrhea,
threatened
and
habitual
abortion
and
to
prevent
premature
labor.
hynson
filed
a
new
drug
for
lutrexin
in
1953
at
which
time
safety
was
the
sole
criterion
for
evaluation
of
such
applications.
the
agency
allowed
the
application
to
go
into
effect,
although
wrote
hynson,
advising
it
at
that
time
that
the
studies
submitted
did
not
indicate
that
the
drug
was
effective
for
these
purposes
and
urging
hynson
not
to
market
it
particularly
for
threatened
and
habitual
abortion.
now
after
the
1962
amendments,
lutrexin
was
reviewed
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
which
concluded,
the
panel
concluded
that
hynson's
claims
for
lutrexin
were
inappropriate
and
unwarranted
in
the
absence
of
adequate
scientific
studies
to
support
them.
lutrexin
was
rated
possibly
effective,
which
was
the
rating
that
specifically
means
that
the
panel
found
there
was
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
supporting
lutrexin's
effectiveness.
after
receiving
the
national
academy
of
sciences'
rating
and
making
his
own
review
of
the
information
before
him
and
giving
hynson
the
opportunity
to
submit
further
information,
the
commissioner
tentatively
concluded
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
of
lutrexin
and
in
march
1969
published
a
notice
of
its
intent
to
withdraw
approval
for
lutrexin's
new
drug
application.
he
offered
an
opportunity
for
hearing
which
lutrexin
at
that
time
--
hynson
at
that
time
accepted.
then
in
august
1969
hynson
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
seeking
to
block
further
proceedings
before
the
agency.
a
year
later
this
suit
was
dismissed
on
primary
jurisdiction
on
exhaustion
grounds
and
hynson
was
remitted
to
the
agency.
in
the
meanwhile
fda
had
adopted
the
regulations
which
mr.
friedman
described
to
you,
carefully
defining
what
kinds
of
studies
would
be
considered
adequate
and
well
controlled
so
that
they
could
qualify
a
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
under
the
1962
amendments.
the
regulations
further
dealt
with
the
question
of
when
a
hearing
would
be
made
available
and
it
required
the
manufacturer
in
requesting
a
hearing
to
submit
and
i
am
quoting
to
the
regulation
as
it
appears
at
page
491
of
the
appendix,
“a
well
organized
and
full
factual
analysis
of
the
clinical
and
other
investigational
data
he
is
prepared
to
prove
in
support
of
his
opposition
to
the
notice
for
opportunity
of
a
hearing.
a
request
for
hearing
may
not
rest
upon
mere
allegations
or
denials,
but
must
set
forth
specific
facts
showing
that
there
is
a
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
facts
that
requires
a
hearing.
when
it
clearly
appears
from
the
data
in
an
application
and
from
the
reasons
and
factual
analysis
and
the
request
for
the
hearing
that
there
is
no
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
fact
which
precludes
the
refusal
to
approve
the
application
or
the
withdrawal
of
approval
of
the
application.
that
is
no
adequate
in
well
controlled
clinical
investigations
to
support
the
claims
of
effectiveness
which
have
been
identified.
the
commissioner
will
enter
an
order
on
this
data
making
findings
and
conclusions
on
this
data.”
now
the
commissioner
wrote
to
hynson
and
advised
them
of
the
new
regulations
and
ask
them
to
make
a
new
submission
in
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
the
regulations.
hynson
made
a
further
submission
after
it
had
lost
the
district
court
action.
in
this
submission,
it
made
three
contentions
to
the
commissioner
which
are
here
before
you
in
this
petition
and
cross
petition
here.
first
it
contended
that
lutrexin
is
today
generally
recognized
as
both
safe
and
effective
and
therefore
not
a
new
drug
and
not
within
the
regulatory
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
secondly,
it
contended
that
because
lutrexin
was
generally
recognized
as
safe,
in
october
1962
it
was
exempted
under
section
107
(c)
(4)
of
the
1962
amendments.
thirdly,
it
contended
that
in
fact
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
lutrexin's
claims
of
effectiveness.
the
commissioner
reviewed
the
material
submitted
by
hynson
and
he
rejected.
he
refused
the
hearing
on
all
three
of
these
issues.
on
review,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
purported
not
to
question
the
validity
of
the
commissioner's
regulations
defining
what
would
constitute
or
qualify
as
substantial
evidence
and
not
to
question
the
regulations
providing
for
a
hearing
only
when
there
is
a
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
fact
regarding
whether
such
evidence
exists.
nevertheless,
it
held
that
the
material
submitted
by
hynson
was
sufficient
to
raise
the
genuine
issue
for
the
drug's
effectiveness.
it
dismissed
the
commissioner's
evaluation
of
the
studies
which
he
had
carefully
made
in
his
order,
noting
that
while
this
was
perhaps
valid,
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
only
be
done
after
a
hearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
certain.
normally
the
procedure
is
designed
to
give
the
manufacturer
a
full
opportunity
to
submit
any
data
he
has
to
be
considered.
now
i
think
that
--
well
let
me
just
say.
i
am
advised
that
if
they
were
request
for
an
oral
presentation
with
regard
to
these
matters
it
would
be
heard
before
the
bureau
of
drugs
but
not
by
the
commissioner
personally,
the
bureau
of
drugs
being
an
administrative
arm
which
reviews
the
medical
issues
involved.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct
and
in
addition
if
the
manufacturer
felt
that
the
commissioner's
order
withdrawing
approval
of
the
nda
for
lutrexin
was
erroneous
because
he
had
in
fact
identified
some
studies
that
might
qualify
as
adequate
and
well
controlled,
he
could
have
petition
for
reconsideration
and
point
it
out
that
the
order
was
defective
in
that
here
indeed
is
something
that
wants
a
hearing
which
you
overlooked.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
one
of
the
issues
here
is
the
complaint
by
the
industry
that
somehow
maybe
the
manufacturer
doesn't
know
what
it
is
that
the
commissioner's
driving
at
when
he
is
going
to
withdraw
approval
of
the
nda.
maybe
he
doesn't
know
what
the
commissioner
finds
to
be
wrong
and
the
commissioner
ought
to
have
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
some
explanation
of
why
he
is
withdrawing
approval
and
with
respect
to
that
contention,
we
don't
think
that
has
any
merit,
but
certainly
by
the
time
he
issues
his
order
withdrawing
approval,
he
has
explained
his
grounds
for
finding
hynson's
material
unacceptable.
and
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
those
grounds
which
i
have
yet
to
hear
anybody
indicate
in
any
concrete
terms,
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
go
back
to
the
commissioner
and
say
you
have
made
a
mistake.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
if
they
were
a
request.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right,
you
could
attempt
to
persuade
them.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
on
the
contrary
you
could
certainly
bring
in
anyone
who
you
wanted
to.
i
mean
the
fda's
position
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
a
significant
difference.
i
mean,
this
record
contains
the
affidavits
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
an
issue
of
fact
that
is
has
hynson
identified
investigations
that
might
possibly,
conceivably
be
considered
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations
within
the
meeting
of
the
statute.
now
you
can
bring
in
an
expert,
a
pharmacologist
who
designs
these
investigations
and
who
would
say,
look
this
is
a
good
investigation
because
it
meets
the
criteria
of
the
regulation
and
has
sound
experiment
at
the
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
could
have
submitted
that
ahead
of
time
in
writing
or
oraly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's
right.
we
are
not
dealing
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding
in
that
sense.
there
isn't
somebody
who
is
going
to
grill
the
manufacturer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
a
submission.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
writing
or
oraly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
you
come
into
the
office
or
you
are
come
into
meet
with
the
bureau
of
drugs
and
you
can
bring
in
your
experts
and
have
them
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
think
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
nature
of
the
hearing
that
would
be
conducted
if
you
--there
must
be.
--
affirm
the
fourth
circuit,
[laughter]
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
in
this
case,
hynson
has
simply
not
submitted
anything
about
which
there
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
what
they
have
in
mind
is
they
want
to
bring
in
witnesses
and
they
want
the
agency
to
establish
an
adversary
to
oppose
them,
to
respond
witnesses
and
cross
examination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
they
would
like
to
have
formal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
difficulty
is
to
get
into
the
nature
of
the
issue.
i
think
that
the
food
and
drug
would
try
to
shape
a
proceeding
assuming
that
they
were
some
issues
to
be
resolved,
if
my
understanding
of
the
procedure
that
they
would
consider
would
be
to
establish
a
panel
of
independent
non-agency
people
to
resolve
the
factual
question
and
his
prominent
scientists
who
are
knowledgeable
in
a
particular
area.
and
i
suppose
that
there
is
a
problem
in
a
sense
that
what
they
are
saying
you
are
not
fighting
us,
you
are
not
putting
somebody,
you
are
not
cross
examining
our
witnesses,
and
you
are
not
putting
somebody
on
the
stand
to
say
what's
wrong
with
our
studies
and
of
course,
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
what
the
commissioner
has
done
is
he
is
looked
at
the
studies
and
he
said,
here
is
a
whole
bunch
of
things
that
are
wrong
in
their
face
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
everyday,
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
one
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
can
argue
here
with
the
agency,
however,
that
is
you
can
present
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
on
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
a
hearing?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
regulation
say
show
us
something
that
we
can
hold
the
hearing
about.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
that
is
nobody
said
that
we
want
some
more
--
you
are
wrong,
we
have
shown
an
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations
and
we
want
some
opportunity
to
talk
to
somebody
about
it
and
i
am
just
not
sure
had
they
said
so
of
whether
the
commissioner
himself
would
grant
them
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
that
issue
but
i
don't
think
we
get
anywhere
near
that
in
this
case
because
they
haven't
come
close
to
raising
any
kind
of
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
this
is
an
administrative
proceeding
and
the
commissioner
is
not
the
adversary
of
this
party.
i
mean
he
is
not
setting
out
to
take
these
drugs
off
the
market.
what
he
is
doing
is
setting
out
to
enforce
the
congressional
mandate
that
has
been
imposed
upon
him.
he
has
a
duty
to
force
that
the
distribution
of
useful
drugs
as
well
as
a
duty
to
take
ineffective
ones
off
the
market.
he
is
not
an
adversary
in
the
sense
that
in
a
judicial
summary
judgment
proceeding
you
have
parties
a
and
b,
who
have
conflicting
interest
with
one
another
and
who
are
fighting
one
another.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it's
understandable
that
hynson
would
view
the
commissioner
in
some
real
sense
as
an
adversary
because
he
has
the
power
to
take
action
which
is
adverse
to
their
interest,
but
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
reasonable
for
him
to
say
the
statute
--
congress
imposed
a
standard
and
imposed
a
standard
of
substantial
evidence.
this
is
an
objective
scientific
standard
and
his
regulations
implement
this
standard
and
set
out
the
criteria
and
it's
certainly
is
reasonable
to
ask
the
manufacturer
to
come
in
and
make
some
showing
of
something,
anything
that
could
possibly
qualify
under
these
regulations
and
under
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
go
that
far
because
normally
in
the
2255
the
judge
has
some
prior
experience,
the
issues
may
have
been
previously
litigated
before
the
judge.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
have
file
what
they
have
to
say
in
support
of
the
merits
of
the
drug
and
the
commissioner
has
looked
at
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely
and
this
is
analogous
to
summary
judgment
except
that
it
doesn't
have
this
adversary
procedure
and
therefore
that
it
doesn't
have
an
active
lawyer
advocate
adversary,
and
therefore
in
that
respect,
it's
somewhat
different
from
the
judicial
summary
judgment,
but
it's
still,
i
think
even
in
the
case
of
a
default,
in
a
judicial
proceeding
if
the
plaintiff
has
not
on
his
face
--
on
the
face
of
the
testimony
that
he
might
submit,
simply
doesn't
make
out
a
case,
the
judge
will
throw
him
out
even
though
there
is
no
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
what
congress
has
required
him
to
do
and
he
has
been
told
in
this
case
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
trace.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
he
is
reviewed
--
the
national
academy
of
sciences
has
reviewed
the
drug
and
they
have
come
up
with
the
conclusion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
possibly
effective
in
that
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that
means
as
we
show
in
our
brief
under
the
instructions
that
they
were
given
by
fda,
that
means
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence,
not
adequate
and
well-controlled.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
possibly
effective
means
that
if
they
were
to
conduct
scientific
test,
since
the
clinical
judgment
of
the
people
on
the
panel,
that
possibly
this
test
would
show
the
drug
to
be
effective,
and
probably
effective
is
their
judgment
that
if
the
scientific
tests
were
conducted,
they
probably
would
show
it
to
be
effective
but
it
is
based
on
their
general
experience
and
not
on
the
kind
of
evidence
that
congress
required.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
has
made
up
his
mind
in
the
sense
that
the
fdc
when
it
issues
a
complaint
for
instance,
he
has
made
up
his
mind,
his
mind
that
there
may
have
violations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
has
made
up
his
mind
that
the
evidence
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
because
the
inquiry
is
does
there
exist
a
certain
kind
of
evidence.
this
is
an
objective
question.
he
looks
in
his
files,
he
gets
his
recommendation
from
the
national
academy
of
sciences,
and
he
says
so
far
i
haven't
seen
anything.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
there
are
--
there
are
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
absolutely.
in
fact,
there
are
56
cases
so
far
of
new
drug
applications
where
he
had
proposed
to
withdraw
that
had
been
rated
less
than
effective
by
the
fda
panels.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
one
is
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
you
submit
a
study,
there
are
objective
criteria
for
evaluating
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
he
has
not
made
up
his
mind
that
the
drug
is
ineffective.
all
that
he
has
concluded
is
that
so
far
he
hasn't
been
shown
adequate
and
well-controlled
clinical
investigations.
now
that
may
mean
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
file.
now
if
the
manufacturer
comes
forward
with
a
study,
he
will
look
at
that
study
and
he
will
match
it
against
the
requirements
of
the
regulations,
he
will
act
in
accordance
with
the
study.
i
think
this
is
a
completely
--
this
notion
that
he
is
somehow
biased
and
out
to
drive
these
people
off
the
market
is
a
completely
fictitious
element.
it
has
been
rejected
in
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
regulation
simply
--
the
statute
simply
says
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations,
including
clinical
investigations.
the
regulations
augment
that
by
incorporating
a
scientifically
recognized
body
of
principles
and
in
our
brief
in
414
in
the
appendices,
we
have
indicated
what
some
of
those
principles
are.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
has
been
made
on
the
other
side,
and
in
fact
the
only
issue
that
they
have
raised
of
a
concrete
nature
by
way
of
this
agreement
was
the
commissioner's
findings
or
suggesting
that
he
may
have
been
wrong
and
there
may
be
an
issue
is
this
ethical
suggestion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
position
is
that
exactly
the
opposite
is
true
and
that
sound
ethics
absolutely
require
scientific
testing,
and
this
point
has
been
recently
and
tragically
brought
home
by
a
drug
called
diethylstilbestrol,
which
is
offered
for
threatened
and
habitual
abortion
and
premature
labor
and
was
widely
used
in
the
past.
it
was
tested
in
a
number
of
controlled
clinical
studies
and
found
to
be
ineffective.
it
turned
out
that
16
years
after
pregnant
women
received
this
drug,
their
female
offspring
contracted
vaginal
cancer.
there
are
safety
problems
with
these
drugs
that
fda
simply
cannot
anticipate
because
they
only
show
up
in
one
case
in
a
million
or
because
they
only
show
up
20
years
later.
the
least
from
an
ethical
stand
point,
that
can
be
required
as
that
these
drugs
to
be
effective
for
what
they
are
being
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
insist
on
it.
for
instance,
you
may
have
a
disease
or
condition
which
has
a
predictable
course,
and
of
which
a
great
deal
is
known
and
threatened
and
habitual
abortion
and
premature
labor
is
not
in
this
category
but
you
may
have
--
for
instance
if
somebody
has
been
bitten
by
a
rabid
animal
and
you
want
to
test
a
vaccine
for
rabies,
you
don't
need
a
controlled
experiment,
all
you
need
to
do
is
give
him
your
vaccine
that
he
doesn't
die,
you
know
its
effect,
but
that's
because
you
know
the
course
of
rabies.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
let
me
go
back
and
try
to
place
some
of
the
problems
that
seem
to
be
concerning
the
court
in
the
context
of
what
fda's
regulatory
problem
was.
it
reviewed
these
4,000
or
so
new
drug
applications
that
had
been
filled
between
1938-1962
and
that
were
for
products
that
was
still
being
marketed,
and
the
national
academy
of
sciences
submitted
recommendations
and
reports
showing
that
they
were
somewhere
between
12,000
and
13,000
claims
that
appeared
not
to
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness.
now
if
any
significant
proportion
of
the
manufacturers
of
drugs
making
these
claims
asked
for
full-dress
evidentiary
hearings,
each
of
which
can
last
two,
three,
four
months,
just
in
order
and
keep
their
product
on
the
market
until
fda
could
act,
the
mission
of
withdrawing
ineffective
drugs
from
the
market
would
be
totally
sabotaged.
it
will
simply
be
impossible
for
the
agency
to
deal
with
this.
i
think
the
question
that
was
asked
earlier
in
the
argument,
there
are
24
lawyers
available
to
enforce
the
food
and
drug
laws
that
court
actions
and
administrative
proceedings,
that
is
besides
of
the
general
counsel's
office
of
food
and
drug.
now
what
--
the
way
that
the
agency
responded
to
this
problem
and
the
reason
it
was
able
to
respond
this
way
was
that
there
was
in
the
statute
an
objective
standard
which
said,
if
you
don't
have
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations,
then
you
can't
stay
on
the
market.
so
the
commissioner
adopted
what
in
effect
is
a
screening
procedure.
he
said
to
the
manufacturer.
you
come
to
me,
you
can
show
me
anything
that
you
want,
bring
me
your
data,
bring
me
your
studies,
whatever
you
have,
lay
it
out
in
the
administrative
record,
and
if
you
have
something
that
looks
like
it
could
possibly
be
an
adequate
a
well-controlled
investigation
supporting
the
effectiveness
claims,
then
we
will
give
you
a
hearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
certainly
for
a
new
compound
that
was
newly
developed
after
1962
would
certainly
be
a
precondition
for
going
on
the
market.
now
of
course
if
you
are
already
on
the
market,
the
question
becomes
your
right
to
say
on
the
market.
and
as
to
this,
congress
also
clearly
intended
that
there
would
be
this
kind
of
clinical
testing.
that's
why
they
gave
the
two-year-grace-period
to
the
manufacturer,
so
we
could
do
this
testing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
now
there
--
on
the
issue
of
historical
controls
which
has
come
up
in
the
case,
it
is
possible
that
you
could
have
an
investigation
that
would
be
considered
adequate
and
well-controlled
within
the
meaning
of
the
statue
even
though
it
didn't
use
concurrent
controls
and
placebo
and
so
on.
that
is
as
the
regulation
indicate,
there
are
circumstances
in
which
what
constitutes
an
adequate
well-controlled
investigation
made
depend
in
part
on
what
it
is
that
your
are
investigating.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
it
has
to
be
a
well-controlled,
scientifically
sound
investigation
and
if
there
is
no
such
investigation,
then
no
parade
of
doctors
swearing
by
the
product
can
save
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
505
(e)
(3)
in
the
case
of
effectiveness.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
what
we
are
proceeding
under
against
lutrexin,
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
means
that
there
must
be
some
substantial
evidence
and
if
there
is
not
some
substantial
evidence,
that
the
approval
must
be
withdrawn.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
--
if
there
is
no
adequate
and
well-controlled
clinical
investigation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
as
mandated
or
amplified
in
the
regulations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
did
not
necessarily
imply
a
concurrent
control
group
but
you
could
use
historical
controls
if
you
have
a
disease,
the
course
of
which
is
so
well
known,
if
you
have
appropriate
pairing
of
the
people
in
the
treatment
group
that
you
are
studying
against
your
historical
control
group
so
that
you
can
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
difference
in
results
is
due
to
something
other
than
the
drug
that
you
are
testing,
but
you
need
some
scientifically
sound
way
of
attributing
the
results
of
your
test,
of
your
treatment
to
the
drug
that
you
are
testing
and
if
don't
have
that,
you
simply
don't
have
the
kind
of
evidence
the
congress
requires.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
if
you
would
look
for
a
minute
at
the
appendix,
at
page
103,
none
of
the
materials
that
hynson
submitted
has
anybody
ever
suggested
could
possibly
constitute
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigation
except
for
the
majewski
and
jennings'
studies
and
the
gratton
(ph)
study,
that's
three
studies.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
majewski
and
jennings
study
which
starts
at
page
99,
he
sets
out
to
study
the
ability
of
lutrexin
to
halt
contractions
and
he
comes
up
with
the
statistics
as
to
the
number
of
people
in
whom
the
contractions
were
halted.
he
never
compares
that
with
anybody
or
anything,
there
is
simply
no
comparison
whatsoever.
it's
obviously
no
way
to
tell
whether
lutrexin
halted
the
contractions.
for
all
we
know
from
this
study,
contraction
spontaneously
halt
at
the
same
rate.
that's
what
i
mean
by
the
lack
of
the
control
and
that's
what
the
commissioner
meant.
now
if
look
at
page
103,
he
had
88
patients
in
his
study
group.
all
88
of
these
patients
gave
birth
prematurely
according
to
the
study.
now
does
this
study
demonstrate
that
lutrexin
is
effective
to
stop
prematurity?
he
has
no
statistical
analysis
of
this
table
four
at
the
top
of
103.
no
showing
that
there
is
any
significant
difference,
statistically
significant
between
group
2
and
group
1.
he
then
goes
down
in
table
5,
he
compares
the
88
patients
who
were
treated
with
lutrexin.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
regulations
i
think
make
it
quite
clear,
it's
clear
on
the
face.
if
you
look
at
this
there
is
nothing
that
could
be
done
at
a
hearing
to
cure
the
fact
for
instance
in
the
gratton
study,
i
have
not
got
time
to
go
into
these
at
detail
but
in
gratton
study,
the
patients
received
concomitant
medication
in
addition
to
lutrexin.
now
there
is
simply
nothing
that
you
could
do
at
a
hearing
to
make
that
study
into
an
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
if
–
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
commissioner's
order
and
if
you
look
at
the
studies,
if
you
look
at
this
study
of
majewski
and
jennings
and
you
compare
that
against
the
regulation,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
study
does
not
come
close
to
complying
and
that
there
is
simply
no
way
that
it
could
be
salvaged
or
reconstituted.
if
this
kind
of
material
is
sufficient
to
require
the
commissioner
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
than
anything
is
because
this
is
just
grossly
an
adequate.
there
simply
is
no
way
to
compare
the
people
who
were
studied
with
the
prior
experience.
you
do
not
know
what
kind
of
medical
treatment
the
other
people
who
are
being
compared
had.
you
don't
know
whether
they
bed
rest,
you
do
not
know
what
are
the
drugs
they
had
received,
you
do
not
--
on
it's
face.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it
is
not
exactly
clear
and
i
think
they
have
not
really
come
forward
and
said,
look
the
commissioner
is
wrong
because
here
is
a
factual
issue.
what
factual
issue?
the
only
factual
issue
that
they
have
suggested
is
whether
historical
controls
are
appropriate
and
since
it
is
quite
clear
on
the
face
that
even
if
historical
controls
with
the
radically
appropriate,
these
are
not
historically
control
studies
and
i
do
not
believe
that
they
have
suggested
that
they
are
historically
controlled
studies,
i
am
not
clear
what
the
hearing
would
be
about.
presumably
they
would
put
doctor
majewski
and
doctor
gratton
on
the
stand
and
have
them
try
to
explain
what
they
were
doing
in
their
studies
and
what
the
results
were,
but
if
they
don't
say
anything
more
than
they
have
here
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
believe
that
it
has
made
clear
in
its
opinion
what
the
hearing
would
be
of.
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
with
effectiveness.
the
commissioner
looked
at
these
studies
and
he
said
on
their
face,
these
studies
do
not
confirm
with
the
regulations
in
numerous
ways.
they
do
not
exclude
concomitant
medication.
they
do
not
have
comparability
between
the
patients.
these
are
things
that
appear
on
the
face
of
the
study.
there
is
simply
--
there
is
no
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all.
they
are
completely
objective
things
that
appear
on
the
face
of
the
study.
if
the
doctor
says
that
these
people
got
multi
vitamins,
they
got
dilutant,
they
got
the
des
(ph),
in
addition
to
getting
lutrexin.
that
appears
on
the
face
of
the
study,
there
isn't
anything
to
hold
a
hearing
about.
these
patients
received
concomitant
medication,
you
cannot
attribute
whatever
results
were
attained
to
lutrexin.
that
is
what
the
regulation
say.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
is
inconceivable.
in
fact,
it
is
clear
that
the
majewski,
for
instance
the
68
majewski
study
is
not
even
a
study.
it
is
a
collection
of
his
experience
over
the
preceding
ten
years.
he
went
back
through
his
files
and
pulled
together
the
results
that
he
got
in
treating
patients
with
lutrexin.
they
never
even
set
out
to
be
a
study.
a
study
has
to
have
an
experimental
design,
a
plan
or
protocol.
it
has
to
have
things
that
are
spelled
out
in
the
regulations
and
in
the
appendix
in
our
brief
in
414,
these
are
objective
requirements.
these
studies
simply
are
miles,
light
years
away
from
meeting
these
requirements.
i
think
i,
in
view
of
the
time,
would
like
to
move
on
to
another
point
if
i
am
clear
enough
for
the
questions
on
this
point.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
question
which
was
touched
upon
earlier
and
which
involves
the
correctness
of
the
commissioner's
denial
of
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
lutrexin
is
today
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective
and
therefore
not
a
new
drug
and
therefore
not
subject
to
this
regulatory
jurisdiction.
but
the
commissioner
said
was
if
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness,
if
there
isn't
the
kind
of
scientific
evidence
that
congress
said
was
required,
then
these
qualified
experts
who,
that
section
201
(p)
talk
about,
couldn't
possibly
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
drug
is
effective.
they
could
not
have
that
general
recognition
of
effectiveness
because
it
would
be
based
on
the
precise
kind
of
unscientific
clinical
impressions
on
controlled
studies,
the
very
kind
of
thing
that
congress
had
been
told
was
an
unreliable
bases
for
evaluating
drug
effectiveness.
congress
had
the
foremost
experts
in
the
country
before
it
and
they
were
uniform
in
their
testimony
that
you
need
controlled
test,
you
need
scientifically
sound
evaluation
and
congress
heeded
their
advice
and
congress
enacted
in
the
statute
a
specific
requirement
of
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations
a
concrete
objective
requirement.
now
it
simply
is
it
seems
to
us
totally
irrational
to
suppose
that
after
congress
went
to
all
the
trouble
of
adopting
this
standard
and
rejecting
these
kinds
of
unscientific
impressions
that
people
have
because
they
use
the
drug
a
few
times
and
it
seem
good
to
them
and
so
did
their
colleagues,
but
the
drug
should
turn
around
and
be
able
to
stay
on
the
market,
that
is
the
commissioner
has
evaluated.
he
has
found
that
won’t.
the
drug
doesn't
have
sub-scientifically
sound
evidence
of
effectiveness.
now
the
manufacturer
turns
around
and
says,
well,
that's
very
interesting,
that's
fine.
i
am
going
to
go
ahead
and
market
it
anyway
and
i
can
produce
10
or
15
doctors
who
will
tell
you
that
they
think
it's
effective
on
the
basis
of
their
uncontrolled,
unscientific
experience.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
just
a
word
or
two
with
respect
to
mr.
williams
and
then
i'll
turn
it
over
to
mr.
hoffman.
the
hemsworth
and
dieckmann
(ph)
studies
were
significantly
different
in
the
sense
that
they
were
controlled
and
i
think
if
you
understand
and
look
at
the
studies
you
will
see
this.
they
took
the
group
of
patients
in
the
studies
and
they
split
them
into
two
groups
and
they
paired
them
in
order
to
eliminate
the
differences
between
the
two
groups.
it's
true
that
they
got
other
medication
apart
from
des
but
both
groups
got
the
same
medication.
they
were
comparable
as
much
as
could
reasonably
be
made
possible
except
that
one
group
had
des
and
one
didn't
and
i
think
that
is
a
significant
difference.
with
respect
to
justice
white's
point
regarding
the
burden
of
the
commissioner
to
come
forward
that
issue
was
tried
and
challenged
by
pma,
it’s
the
(inaudible)
regulations
in
the
pharmaceutical
manufactures
association
of
which
hynson
is
a
member
and
it
was
adjudicated
in
favor
of
the
commissioner.
also
the
ciba-geigy
case
in
the
second
circuit
upheld
the
commissioner's
view
on
that
position,
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
this
holding
in
this
case
that
'me-too'
drugs
are
exempted
as
compelled
by
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
and
as
i
listen
to
mr.
hoffman,
he
is
urging
you
to
feel
compelled
by
the
same
literal
language
of
the
statute
regardless
of
how
absurd
the
results,
but
the
whole
house
of
cards
that
congress
erected
fall
down
on
our
heads,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
requires
it.
now
we
submit
that
the
language
of
section
107
(c)
(4)
in
no
way
compels
an
exemption
of
'me-too'
and
indeed,
that
the
only
sensible
way
you
can
read
the
provision
does
not
exempt
to
products.
it
treats
them
in
the
same
way
as
the
products
that
were
named
in
the
new
drug
application.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it's
very
significant
if
you
will
turn
to
the
statute,
i
rely
not
on
the
statute
that
mr.
hoffman
read
to
you
in
which
he
inserted
the
word
product
in
place
of
drugs,
i
rely
on
section
107
©
(4).
now
section
107
©
(4)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
page
482,
it
does
not
say
in
the
case
of
any
product
which
was
not
covered
by
an
effective
application.
it
says
in
the
case
of
any
drug.
now,
the
drug
here
is
bioflavonoids,
the
product
is
bivam.
now
there
isn't
anything
here
on
this
page,
in
this
statute
that
compels
you
to
read
that
to
say
bivam
instead
of
bioflavonoids
and
if
you
read
it
in
the
generic
sense
that
we
are
urge
in
our
brief,
everything
falls
in
place
and
you
have
a
coherent
in
sense
of
s
statutory
claim.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
because
it
depends
on
the
degree
of
similarity
of
the
product.
you
can
have
and
in
many
cases
you
have
a
product
that
is
identical
in
everything,
but
the
brand
name
and
under
the
court
of
appeals,
reading
that
product
would
be
the
'me-too'.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now
there
is
an
issue
in
some
cases
as
there
is
in
the
bentex
case
for
instance,
as
to
whether
you
may
really
be
dealing
with
a
different
drug
that
is
not
the
same
drug
that
was
covered
by
the
new
drug
application,
but
the
position
of
the
agency
and
it
has
been
explained
in
its
drug
efficacy
study
implementation
regulations
of
october
1972
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
is
basically
that
identical,
similar
or
related
products
and
this
is
defined
by
chemical
composition
and
therapeutic
use.
it's
a
scientific
concept
which
has
parameters
which
i
can’t
really
get
into
today
and
there
can
be
factual
issues
as
to
whether
a
particular
product
is
in
the
same
generic
family
with
the
drug
discovered
by
the
nda.
now,
if
section
107(c)(4)
is
construed
in
the
way
usv
urges
in
an
individual
product
sense,
the
results
are
irrational;
they
are
discriminatory
among
manufacturers.
they
are
completely
disruptive
of
the
congressional
purpose
and
requiring
that
drugs
be
shown
to
be
effective
for
their
claim
uses.
now
let
me
give
you
scenario
of
what
would
happen.
sometime
between
1938
and
1962,
a
manufacturer
decides
there
are
certain
compound
is
useful
for
the
treatment
of
a
certain
disease
or
condition.
he
does
studies
on
regarding
the
safety
of
that
compound
and
he
files
an
application
with
fda,
which
reviews
his
application
and
allows
it
to
go
into
effect.
he
then
starts
manufacturing
that
product.
now
two
or
three
or
five
other
manufacturers
may
decide
that
they
also
want
to
market
the
same
product
and
if
it's
not
patent,
they
are
free
to
do
so
except
they
have
to
file
their
own
applications
until
such
time
as
the
drug
comes
to
be
generally
recognized
as
safe,
which
it
comes
to
be
because
there
have
been
nda
products
out
on
the
market
that
are
generically
the
same
and
at
that
point
any
manufacturer
can
market
his
product
without
going
through
the
regulatory
procedure
and
that
includes
the
nda
holder
who
can
put
it
out
under
different
brand
names
or
anything
else.
now,
the
ratio
of
these
'me-too'
products
to
the
products
that
are
named
in
the
application
is
quite
high.
fda
has
found
that
it's
high
as
13:1;
in
the
bentex
case,
we
have
23
manufacturers
of
'me-too'
products
and
only
two
manufacturers
who
held
nda’s.
now
under
the
1962
amendments,
congress
said
review
these
nda’s,
determine
the
efficacy
if
these
drugs
and
the
agency
does
it
and
the
agency
finds
under
the
standards
that
congress
has
established
that
the
drugs
are
ineffective
or
that
they
lack
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness,
which
is
somewhat
different
and
it
withdraws
approval
of
the
nda’s
and
it
takes
the
pioneer
drugs
off
the
market
and
here
are
20
other
manufacturers,
still
on
the
market
with
the
identical
product
sitting
in
the
drug
store
shelves.
nothing
has
been
accomplished
for
the
consumer,
nothing
has
been
accomplished,
but
a
completely
irrational
discrimination
between
identically
situated
people
that
does
not
correspond
to
any
regulatory
purpose
that
congress
had.
now,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicates
this
was
congress's
intent.
mr.
hoffman
relies
on
something
in
part
two
of
the
senate
report
when
he
says
that
they
were
concerned
with
new
claims.
he
omits
in
his
brief
and
he
omitted
to
mention
in
his
argument,
the
closing
sentence
of
that
paragraph
which
says
the
effect
of
this
amendment
on
drugs
already
on
the
market
is
discussed
below
under
transitional
provisions.
so
that
the
paragraph
on
which
he
relies
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
effect
of
the
amendment
of
section
201
on
drugs
already
on
the
market
in
1962.
now
he
says,
well
let's
rely
and
the
industry
says,
let's
rely
on
the
power
of
fda
as
a
prosecutor
with
the
aid
of
the
department
of
justice
to
go
chasing
these
people
in
the
courts
with
these
very
serious
remedies.
and
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
tried
to
point
out
to
the
court
some
of
the
practical
problems
that
exist.
but
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
now,
is
that
congress
when
they
passed
the
1962
amendments
expressed
a
concern
with
the
inadequacy
of
the
judicial
remedies.
they
said,
even
where
the
effectiveness,
this
is
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
house
report
hr
24/64,
page
3,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
“even
where
the
effectiveness
of
the
new
drug
enters
into
determining
its
safety,
the
food
and
drug
administration
cannot,
if
it
finds
the
drug
safe,
refuse
clearance
because
the
claim
of
effectiveness
is
exaggerated,”
that's
under
the
old
statute.
“rather
the
administration
would
have
to
stultify
itself
by
allowing
clearance
and
then
causing
court
action
to
be
brought
for
mis-branding.”
committee
goes
on
to
note
“as
a
result
of
good
medical
practice
is
hampered
and
the
consumer
is
mislead
until
perhaps
years
later
the
government
has
gathered
the
necessary
evidence
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proving
the
violation
in
courts.”
that
is
what
congress
was
concerned
about,
when
it
sought
to
bring
these
drugs
under
the
regulatory
scheme
for
evaluation
of
drug
ethics.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
and
in
a
similar
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
the
administrative
proceeding
the
burden
is
clearly
on
the
manufacturer.
he
must
demonstrate
that
there
exists
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
and
i
think
that's
the
only
way
it
could
be;
there
is
no
practical
way
for
the
commissioner
to
demonstrate
the
non
existence
of
such
evidence.
i
don't
know
how
he
would
go
about
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that's
correct
and
that's
of
significant
difference
in
the
terms
of
the
discrimination
between
the
pioneer
and
the
''me-too'.'
the
pioneer
is
being
made
to
show
to
the
agency's
satisfaction
that
there
exists
substantial
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
in
the
'me-too'
if
the
fda
could
ever
chase
after
and
collar
all
of
them
all
over
the
country
in
these
thousands
of
individual
suits,
the
burden
would
be
on
fda
to
establish
their
ineffectiveness
in
mis-branding
action.
now
the
structure
of
the
62
amendments
of
107
(c)
(4)
clearly
supports
our
position,
107
(c)
(4)
talks
about
the
applicability
of
the
revised
definition
of
new
drug
in
201
(p).
nobody
has
told
you
and
nobody
will
tell
you
that
the
definition
in
201
(p)
is
an
individual
product
sense.
it's
generic
and
plain
common
sense
tells
us
to
interpret
section
107
(c)
(4)
for
generically
also.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
hynson
cases
numbers
394
and
414
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
holding
that
the
commissioner
acted
improperly
in
withdrawing
approval,
for
instance
product
lutrexin
without
a
hearing.
lutrexin
is
a
drug
product
whose
active
ingredient
lututrin
is
an
extract
from
sow
ovaries.
it's
offered
for
the
treatment
for
dysmenorrhea,
threatened
and
habitual
abortion
and
to
prevent
premature
labor.
hynson
filed
a
new
drug
for
lutrexin
in
1953
at
which
time
safety
was
the
sole
criterion
for
evaluation
of
such
applications.
the
agency
allowed
the
application
to
go
into
effect,
although
wrote
hynson,
advising
it
at
that
time
that
the
studies
submitted
did
not
indicate
that
the
drug
was
effective
for
these
purposes
and
urging
hynson
not
to
market
it
particularly
for
threatened
and
habitual
abortion.
now
after
the
1962
amendments,
lutrexin
was
reviewed
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
which
concluded,
the
panel
concluded
that
hynson's
claims
for
lutrexin
were
inappropriate
and
unwarranted
in
the
absence
of
adequate
scientific
studies
to
support
them.
lutrexin
was
rated
possibly
effective,
which
was
the
rating
that
specifically
means
that
the
panel
found
there
was
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
supporting
lutrexin's
effectiveness.
after
receiving
the
national
academy
of
sciences'
rating
and
making
his
own
review
of
the
information
before
him
and
giving
hynson
the
opportunity
to
submit
further
information,
the
commissioner
tentatively
concluded
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
of
lutrexin
and
in
march
1969
published
a
notice
of
its
intent
to
withdraw
approval
for
lutrexin's
new
drug
application.
he
offered
an
opportunity
for
hearing
which
lutrexin
at
that
time
--
hynson
at
that
time
accepted.
then
in
august
1969
hynson
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
seeking
to
block
further
proceedings
before
the
agency.
a
year
later
this
suit
was
dismissed
on
primary
jurisdiction
on
exhaustion
grounds
and
hynson
was
remitted
to
the
agency.
in
the
meanwhile
fda
had
adopted
the
regulations
which
mr.
friedman
described
to
you,
carefully
defining
what
kinds
of
studies
would
be
considered
adequate
and
well
controlled
so
that
they
could
qualify
a
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
under
the
1962
amendments.
the
regulations
further
dealt
with
the
question
of
when
a
hearing
would
be
made
available
and
it
required
the
manufacturer
in
requesting
a
hearing
to
submit
and
i
am
quoting
to
the
regulation
as
it
appears
at
page
491
of
the
appendix,
“a
well
organized
and
full
factual
analysis
of
the
clinical
and
other
investigational
data
he
is
prepared
to
prove
in
support
of
his
opposition
to
the
notice
for
opportunity
of
a
hearing.
a
request
for
hearing
may
not
rest
upon
mere
allegations
or
denials,
but
must
set
forth
specific
facts
showing
that
there
is
a
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
facts
that
requires
a
hearing.
when
it
clearly
appears
from
the
data
in
an
application
and
from
the
reasons
and
factual
analysis
and
the
request
for
the
hearing
that
there
is
no
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
fact
which
precludes
the
refusal
to
approve
the
application
or
the
withdrawal
of
approval
of
the
application.
that
is
no
adequate
in
well
controlled
clinical
investigations
to
support
the
claims
of
effectiveness
which
have
been
identified.
the
commissioner
will
enter
an
order
on
this
data
making
findings
and
conclusions
on
this
data.”
now
the
commissioner
wrote
to
hynson
and
advised
them
of
the
new
regulations
and
ask
them
to
make
a
new
submission
in
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
the
regulations.
hynson
made
a
further
submission
after
it
had
lost
the
district
court
action.
in
this
submission,
it
made
three
contentions
to
the
commissioner
which
are
here
before
you
in
this
petition
and
cross
petition
here.
first
it
contended
that
lutrexin
is
today
generally
recognized
as
both
safe
and
effective
and
therefore
not
a
new
drug
and
not
within
the
regulatory
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
secondly,
it
contended
that
because
lutrexin
was
generally
recognized
as
safe,
in
october
1962
it
was
exempted
under
section
107
(c)
(4)
of
the
1962
amendments.
thirdly,
it
contended
that
in
fact
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
lutrexin's
claims
of
effectiveness.
the
commissioner
reviewed
the
material
submitted
by
hynson
and
he
rejected.
he
refused
the
hearing
on
all
three
of
these
issues.
on
review,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
purported
not
to
question
the
validity
of
the
commissioner's
regulations
defining
what
would
constitute
or
qualify
as
substantial
evidence
and
not
to
question
the
regulations
providing
for
a
hearing
only
when
there
is
a
genuine
and
substantial
issue
of
fact
regarding
whether
such
evidence
exists.
nevertheless,
it
held
that
the
material
submitted
by
hynson
was
sufficient
to
raise
the
genuine
issue
for
the
drug's
effectiveness.
it
dismissed
the
commissioner's
evaluation
of
the
studies
which
he
had
carefully
made
in
his
order,
noting
that
while
this
was
perhaps
valid,
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
only
be
done
after
a
hearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
certain.
normally
the
procedure
is
designed
to
give
the
manufacturer
a
full
opportunity
to
submit
any
data
he
has
to
be
considered.
now
i
think
that
--
well
let
me
just
say.
i
am
advised
that
if
they
were
request
for
an
oral
presentation
with
regard
to
these
matters
it
would
be
heard
before
the
bureau
of
drugs
but
not
by
the
commissioner
personally,
the
bureau
of
drugs
being
an
administrative
arm
which
reviews
the
medical
issues
involved.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct
and
in
addition
if
the
manufacturer
felt
that
the
commissioner's
order
withdrawing
approval
of
the
nda
for
lutrexin
was
erroneous
because
he
had
in
fact
identified
some
studies
that
might
qualify
as
adequate
and
well
controlled,
he
could
have
petition
for
reconsideration
and
point
it
out
that
the
order
was
defective
in
that
here
indeed
is
something
that
wants
a
hearing
which
you
overlooked.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
one
of
the
issues
here
is
the
complaint
by
the
industry
that
somehow
maybe
the
manufacturer
doesn't
know
what
it
is
that
the
commissioner's
driving
at
when
he
is
going
to
withdraw
approval
of
the
nda.
maybe
he
doesn't
know
what
the
commissioner
finds
to
be
wrong
and
the
commissioner
ought
to
have
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
some
explanation
of
why
he
is
withdrawing
approval
and
with
respect
to
that
contention,
we
don't
think
that
has
any
merit,
but
certainly
by
the
time
he
issues
his
order
withdrawing
approval,
he
has
explained
his
grounds
for
finding
hynson's
material
unacceptable.
and
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
those
grounds
which
i
have
yet
to
hear
anybody
indicate
in
any
concrete
terms,
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
go
back
to
the
commissioner
and
say
you
have
made
a
mistake.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
if
they
were
a
request.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right,
you
could
attempt
to
persuade
them.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
on
the
contrary
you
could
certainly
bring
in
anyone
who
you
wanted
to.
i
mean
the
fda's
position
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
a
significant
difference.
i
mean,
this
record
contains
the
affidavits
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
an
issue
of
fact
that
is
has
hynson
identified
investigations
that
might
possibly,
conceivably
be
considered
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations
within
the
meeting
of
the
statute.
now
you
can
bring
in
an
expert,
a
pharmacologist
who
designs
these
investigations
and
who
would
say,
look
this
is
a
good
investigation
because
it
meets
the
criteria
of
the
regulation
and
has
sound
experiment
at
the
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
could
have
submitted
that
ahead
of
time
in
writing
or
oraly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's
right.
we
are
not
dealing
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding
in
that
sense.
there
isn't
somebody
who
is
going
to
grill
the
manufacturer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
a
submission.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
writing
or
oraly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
you
come
into
the
office
or
you
are
come
into
meet
with
the
bureau
of
drugs
and
you
can
bring
in
your
experts
and
have
them
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
think
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
nature
of
the
hearing
that
would
be
conducted
if
you
--there
must
be.
--
affirm
the
fourth
circuit,
[laughter]
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
in
this
case,
hynson
has
simply
not
submitted
anything
about
which
there
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
what
they
have
in
mind
is
they
want
to
bring
in
witnesses
and
they
want
the
agency
to
establish
an
adversary
to
oppose
them,
to
respond
witnesses
and
cross
examination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
they
would
like
to
have
formal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
difficulty
is
to
get
into
the
nature
of
the
issue.
i
think
that
the
food
and
drug
would
try
to
shape
a
proceeding
assuming
that
they
were
some
issues
to
be
resolved,
if
my
understanding
of
the
procedure
that
they
would
consider
would
be
to
establish
a
panel
of
independent
non-agency
people
to
resolve
the
factual
question
and
his
prominent
scientists
who
are
knowledgeable
in
a
particular
area.
and
i
suppose
that
there
is
a
problem
in
a
sense
that
what
they
are
saying
you
are
not
fighting
us,
you
are
not
putting
somebody,
you
are
not
cross
examining
our
witnesses,
and
you
are
not
putting
somebody
on
the
stand
to
say
what's
wrong
with
our
studies
and
of
course,
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
what
the
commissioner
has
done
is
he
is
looked
at
the
studies
and
he
said,
here
is
a
whole
bunch
of
things
that
are
wrong
in
their
face
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
everyday,
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
one
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
can
argue
here
with
the
agency,
however,
that
is
you
can
present
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
on
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
a
hearing?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
regulation
say
show
us
something
that
we
can
hold
the
hearing
about.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
that
is
nobody
said
that
we
want
some
more
--
you
are
wrong,
we
have
shown
an
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations
and
we
want
some
opportunity
to
talk
to
somebody
about
it
and
i
am
just
not
sure
had
they
said
so
of
whether
the
commissioner
himself
would
grant
them
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
that
issue
but
i
don't
think
we
get
anywhere
near
that
in
this
case
because
they
haven't
come
close
to
raising
any
kind
of
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
this
is
an
administrative
proceeding
and
the
commissioner
is
not
the
adversary
of
this
party.
i
mean
he
is
not
setting
out
to
take
these
drugs
off
the
market.
what
he
is
doing
is
setting
out
to
enforce
the
congressional
mandate
that
has
been
imposed
upon
him.
he
has
a
duty
to
force
that
the
distribution
of
useful
drugs
as
well
as
a
duty
to
take
ineffective
ones
off
the
market.
he
is
not
an
adversary
in
the
sense
that
in
a
judicial
summary
judgment
proceeding
you
have
parties
a
and
b,
who
have
conflicting
interest
with
one
another
and
who
are
fighting
one
another.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it's
understandable
that
hynson
would
view
the
commissioner
in
some
real
sense
as
an
adversary
because
he
has
the
power
to
take
action
which
is
adverse
to
their
interest,
but
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
reasonable
for
him
to
say
the
statute
--
congress
imposed
a
standard
and
imposed
a
standard
of
substantial
evidence.
this
is
an
objective
scientific
standard
and
his
regulations
implement
this
standard
and
set
out
the
criteria
and
it's
certainly
is
reasonable
to
ask
the
manufacturer
to
come
in
and
make
some
showing
of
something,
anything
that
could
possibly
qualify
under
these
regulations
and
under
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
go
that
far
because
normally
in
the
2255
the
judge
has
some
prior
experience,
the
issues
may
have
been
previously
litigated
before
the
judge.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
have
file
what
they
have
to
say
in
support
of
the
merits
of
the
drug
and
the
commissioner
has
looked
at
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely
and
this
is
analogous
to
summary
judgment
except
that
it
doesn't
have
this
adversary
procedure
and
therefore
that
it
doesn't
have
an
active
lawyer
advocate
adversary,
and
therefore
in
that
respect,
it's
somewhat
different
from
the
judicial
summary
judgment,
but
it's
still,
i
think
even
in
the
case
of
a
default,
in
a
judicial
proceeding
if
the
plaintiff
has
not
on
his
face
--
on
the
face
of
the
testimony
that
he
might
submit,
simply
doesn't
make
out
a
case,
the
judge
will
throw
him
out
even
though
there
is
no
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
what
congress
has
required
him
to
do
and
he
has
been
told
in
this
case
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
trace.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
he
is
reviewed
--
the
national
academy
of
sciences
has
reviewed
the
drug
and
they
have
come
up
with
the
conclusion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
possibly
effective
in
that
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that
means
as
we
show
in
our
brief
under
the
instructions
that
they
were
given
by
fda,
that
means
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence,
not
adequate
and
well-controlled.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
possibly
effective
means
that
if
they
were
to
conduct
scientific
test,
since
the
clinical
judgment
of
the
people
on
the
panel,
that
possibly
this
test
would
show
the
drug
to
be
effective,
and
probably
effective
is
their
judgment
that
if
the
scientific
tests
were
conducted,
they
probably
would
show
it
to
be
effective
but
it
is
based
on
their
general
experience
and
not
on
the
kind
of
evidence
that
congress
required.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
has
made
up
his
mind
in
the
sense
that
the
fdc
when
it
issues
a
complaint
for
instance,
he
has
made
up
his
mind,
his
mind
that
there
may
have
violations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
has
made
up
his
mind
that
the
evidence
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
because
the
inquiry
is
does
there
exist
a
certain
kind
of
evidence.
this
is
an
objective
question.
he
looks
in
his
files,
he
gets
his
recommendation
from
the
national
academy
of
sciences,
and
he
says
so
far
i
haven't
seen
anything.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
there
are
--
there
are
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
absolutely.
in
fact,
there
are
56
cases
so
far
of
new
drug
applications
where
he
had
proposed
to
withdraw
that
had
been
rated
less
than
effective
by
the
fda
panels.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
one
is
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
you
submit
a
study,
there
are
objective
criteria
for
evaluating
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
he
has
not
made
up
his
mind
that
the
drug
is
ineffective.
all
that
he
has
concluded
is
that
so
far
he
hasn't
been
shown
adequate
and
well-controlled
clinical
investigations.
now
that
may
mean
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
file.
now
if
the
manufacturer
comes
forward
with
a
study,
he
will
look
at
that
study
and
he
will
match
it
against
the
requirements
of
the
regulations,
he
will
act
in
accordance
with
the
study.
i
think
this
is
a
completely
--
this
notion
that
he
is
somehow
biased
and
out
to
drive
these
people
off
the
market
is
a
completely
fictitious
element.
it
has
been
rejected
in
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
regulation
simply
--
the
statute
simply
says
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations,
including
clinical
investigations.
the
regulations
augment
that
by
incorporating
a
scientifically
recognized
body
of
principles
and
in
our
brief
in
414
in
the
appendices,
we
have
indicated
what
some
of
those
principles
are.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
has
been
made
on
the
other
side,
and
in
fact
the
only
issue
that
they
have
raised
of
a
concrete
nature
by
way
of
this
agreement
was
the
commissioner's
findings
or
suggesting
that
he
may
have
been
wrong
and
there
may
be
an
issue
is
this
ethical
suggestion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
position
is
that
exactly
the
opposite
is
true
and
that
sound
ethics
absolutely
require
scientific
testing,
and
this
point
has
been
recently
and
tragically
brought
home
by
a
drug
called
diethylstilbestrol,
which
is
offered
for
threatened
and
habitual
abortion
and
premature
labor
and
was
widely
used
in
the
past.
it
was
tested
in
a
number
of
controlled
clinical
studies
and
found
to
be
ineffective.
it
turned
out
that
16
years
after
pregnant
women
received
this
drug,
their
female
offspring
contracted
vaginal
cancer.
there
are
safety
problems
with
these
drugs
that
fda
simply
cannot
anticipate
because
they
only
show
up
in
one
case
in
a
million
or
because
they
only
show
up
20
years
later.
the
least
from
an
ethical
stand
point,
that
can
be
required
as
that
these
drugs
to
be
effective
for
what
they
are
being
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
insist
on
it.
for
instance,
you
may
have
a
disease
or
condition
which
has
a
predictable
course,
and
of
which
a
great
deal
is
known
and
threatened
and
habitual
abortion
and
premature
labor
is
not
in
this
category
but
you
may
have
--
for
instance
if
somebody
has
been
bitten
by
a
rabid
animal
and
you
want
to
test
a
vaccine
for
rabies,
you
don't
need
a
controlled
experiment,
all
you
need
to
do
is
give
him
your
vaccine
that
he
doesn't
die,
you
know
its
effect,
but
that's
because
you
know
the
course
of
rabies.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
let
me
go
back
and
try
to
place
some
of
the
problems
that
seem
to
be
concerning
the
court
in
the
context
of
what
fda's
regulatory
problem
was.
it
reviewed
these
4,000
or
so
new
drug
applications
that
had
been
filled
between
1938-1962
and
that
were
for
products
that
was
still
being
marketed,
and
the
national
academy
of
sciences
submitted
recommendations
and
reports
showing
that
they
were
somewhere
between
12,000
and
13,000
claims
that
appeared
not
to
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness.
now
if
any
significant
proportion
of
the
manufacturers
of
drugs
making
these
claims
asked
for
full-dress
evidentiary
hearings,
each
of
which
can
last
two,
three,
four
months,
just
in
order
and
keep
their
product
on
the
market
until
fda
could
act,
the
mission
of
withdrawing
ineffective
drugs
from
the
market
would
be
totally
sabotaged.
it
will
simply
be
impossible
for
the
agency
to
deal
with
this.
i
think
the
question
that
was
asked
earlier
in
the
argument,
there
are
24
lawyers
available
to
enforce
the
food
and
drug
laws
that
court
actions
and
administrative
proceedings,
that
is
besides
of
the
general
counsel's
office
of
food
and
drug.
now
what
--
the
way
that
the
agency
responded
to
this
problem
and
the
reason
it
was
able
to
respond
this
way
was
that
there
was
in
the
statute
an
objective
standard
which
said,
if
you
don't
have
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations,
then
you
can't
stay
on
the
market.
so
the
commissioner
adopted
what
in
effect
is
a
screening
procedure.
he
said
to
the
manufacturer.
you
come
to
me,
you
can
show
me
anything
that
you
want,
bring
me
your
data,
bring
me
your
studies,
whatever
you
have,
lay
it
out
in
the
administrative
record,
and
if
you
have
something
that
looks
like
it
could
possibly
be
an
adequate
a
well-controlled
investigation
supporting
the
effectiveness
claims,
then
we
will
give
you
a
hearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
certainly
for
a
new
compound
that
was
newly
developed
after
1962
would
certainly
be
a
precondition
for
going
on
the
market.
now
of
course
if
you
are
already
on
the
market,
the
question
becomes
your
right
to
say
on
the
market.
and
as
to
this,
congress
also
clearly
intended
that
there
would
be
this
kind
of
clinical
testing.
that's
why
they
gave
the
two-year-grace-period
to
the
manufacturer,
so
we
could
do
this
testing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
now
there
--
on
the
issue
of
historical
controls
which
has
come
up
in
the
case,
it
is
possible
that
you
could
have
an
investigation
that
would
be
considered
adequate
and
well-controlled
within
the
meaning
of
the
statue
even
though
it
didn't
use
concurrent
controls
and
placebo
and
so
on.
that
is
as
the
regulation
indicate,
there
are
circumstances
in
which
what
constitutes
an
adequate
well-controlled
investigation
made
depend
in
part
on
what
it
is
that
your
are
investigating.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
it
has
to
be
a
well-controlled,
scientifically
sound
investigation
and
if
there
is
no
such
investigation,
then
no
parade
of
doctors
swearing
by
the
product
can
save
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
505
(e)
(3)
in
the
case
of
effectiveness.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
what
we
are
proceeding
under
against
lutrexin,
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
means
that
there
must
be
some
substantial
evidence
and
if
there
is
not
some
substantial
evidence,
that
the
approval
must
be
withdrawn.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
--
if
there
is
no
adequate
and
well-controlled
clinical
investigation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
as
mandated
or
amplified
in
the
regulations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
did
not
necessarily
imply
a
concurrent
control
group
but
you
could
use
historical
controls
if
you
have
a
disease,
the
course
of
which
is
so
well
known,
if
you
have
appropriate
pairing
of
the
people
in
the
treatment
group
that
you
are
studying
against
your
historical
control
group
so
that
you
can
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
difference
in
results
is
due
to
something
other
than
the
drug
that
you
are
testing,
but
you
need
some
scientifically
sound
way
of
attributing
the
results
of
your
test,
of
your
treatment
to
the
drug
that
you
are
testing
and
if
don't
have
that,
you
simply
don't
have
the
kind
of
evidence
the
congress
requires.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
if
you
would
look
for
a
minute
at
the
appendix,
at
page
103,
none
of
the
materials
that
hynson
submitted
has
anybody
ever
suggested
could
possibly
constitute
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigation
except
for
the
majewski
and
jennings'
studies
and
the
gratton
(ph)
study,
that's
three
studies.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
majewski
and
jennings
study
which
starts
at
page
99,
he
sets
out
to
study
the
ability
of
lutrexin
to
halt
contractions
and
he
comes
up
with
the
statistics
as
to
the
number
of
people
in
whom
the
contractions
were
halted.
he
never
compares
that
with
anybody
or
anything,
there
is
simply
no
comparison
whatsoever.
it's
obviously
no
way
to
tell
whether
lutrexin
halted
the
contractions.
for
all
we
know
from
this
study,
contraction
spontaneously
halt
at
the
same
rate.
that's
what
i
mean
by
the
lack
of
the
control
and
that's
what
the
commissioner
meant.
now
if
look
at
page
103,
he
had
88
patients
in
his
study
group.
all
88
of
these
patients
gave
birth
prematurely
according
to
the
study.
now
does
this
study
demonstrate
that
lutrexin
is
effective
to
stop
prematurity?
he
has
no
statistical
analysis
of
this
table
four
at
the
top
of
103.
no
showing
that
there
is
any
significant
difference,
statistically
significant
between
group
2
and
group
1.
he
then
goes
down
in
table
5,
he
compares
the
88
patients
who
were
treated
with
lutrexin.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
regulations
i
think
make
it
quite
clear,
it's
clear
on
the
face.
if
you
look
at
this
there
is
nothing
that
could
be
done
at
a
hearing
to
cure
the
fact
for
instance
in
the
gratton
study,
i
have
not
got
time
to
go
into
these
at
detail
but
in
gratton
study,
the
patients
received
concomitant
medication
in
addition
to
lutrexin.
now
there
is
simply
nothing
that
you
could
do
at
a
hearing
to
make
that
study
into
an
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
if
–
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
commissioner's
order
and
if
you
look
at
the
studies,
if
you
look
at
this
study
of
majewski
and
jennings
and
you
compare
that
against
the
regulation,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
study
does
not
come
close
to
complying
and
that
there
is
simply
no
way
that
it
could
be
salvaged
or
reconstituted.
if
this
kind
of
material
is
sufficient
to
require
the
commissioner
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
than
anything
is
because
this
is
just
grossly
an
adequate.
there
simply
is
no
way
to
compare
the
people
who
were
studied
with
the
prior
experience.
you
do
not
know
what
kind
of
medical
treatment
the
other
people
who
are
being
compared
had.
you
don't
know
whether
they
bed
rest,
you
do
not
know
what
are
the
drugs
they
had
received,
you
do
not
--
on
it's
face.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it
is
not
exactly
clear
and
i
think
they
have
not
really
come
forward
and
said,
look
the
commissioner
is
wrong
because
here
is
a
factual
issue.
what
factual
issue?
the
only
factual
issue
that
they
have
suggested
is
whether
historical
controls
are
appropriate
and
since
it
is
quite
clear
on
the
face
that
even
if
historical
controls
with
the
radically
appropriate,
these
are
not
historically
control
studies
and
i
do
not
believe
that
they
have
suggested
that
they
are
historically
controlled
studies,
i
am
not
clear
what
the
hearing
would
be
about.
presumably
they
would
put
doctor
majewski
and
doctor
gratton
on
the
stand
and
have
them
try
to
explain
what
they
were
doing
in
their
studies
and
what
the
results
were,
but
if
they
don't
say
anything
more
than
they
have
here
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
believe
that
it
has
made
clear
in
its
opinion
what
the
hearing
would
be
of.
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
with
effectiveness.
the
commissioner
looked
at
these
studies
and
he
said
on
their
face,
these
studies
do
not
confirm
with
the
regulations
in
numerous
ways.
they
do
not
exclude
concomitant
medication.
they
do
not
have
comparability
between
the
patients.
these
are
things
that
appear
on
the
face
of
the
study.
there
is
simply
--
there
is
no
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all.
they
are
completely
objective
things
that
appear
on
the
face
of
the
study.
if
the
doctor
says
that
these
people
got
multi
vitamins,
they
got
dilutant,
they
got
the
des
(ph),
in
addition
to
getting
lutrexin.
that
appears
on
the
face
of
the
study,
there
isn't
anything
to
hold
a
hearing
about.
these
patients
received
concomitant
medication,
you
cannot
attribute
whatever
results
were
attained
to
lutrexin.
that
is
what
the
regulation
say.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
is
inconceivable.
in
fact,
it
is
clear
that
the
majewski,
for
instance
the
68
majewski
study
is
not
even
a
study.
it
is
a
collection
of
his
experience
over
the
preceding
ten
years.
he
went
back
through
his
files
and
pulled
together
the
results
that
he
got
in
treating
patients
with
lutrexin.
they
never
even
set
out
to
be
a
study.
a
study
has
to
have
an
experimental
design,
a
plan
or
protocol.
it
has
to
have
things
that
are
spelled
out
in
the
regulations
and
in
the
appendix
in
our
brief
in
414,
these
are
objective
requirements.
these
studies
simply
are
miles,
light
years
away
from
meeting
these
requirements.
i
think
i,
in
view
of
the
time,
would
like
to
move
on
to
another
point
if
i
am
clear
enough
for
the
questions
on
this
point.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
question
which
was
touched
upon
earlier
and
which
involves
the
correctness
of
the
commissioner's
denial
of
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
lutrexin
is
today
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective
and
therefore
not
a
new
drug
and
therefore
not
subject
to
this
regulatory
jurisdiction.
but
the
commissioner
said
was
if
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness,
if
there
isn't
the
kind
of
scientific
evidence
that
congress
said
was
required,
then
these
qualified
experts
who,
that
section
201
(p)
talk
about,
couldn't
possibly
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
drug
is
effective.
they
could
not
have
that
general
recognition
of
effectiveness
because
it
would
be
based
on
the
precise
kind
of
unscientific
clinical
impressions
on
controlled
studies,
the
very
kind
of
thing
that
congress
had
been
told
was
an
unreliable
bases
for
evaluating
drug
effectiveness.
congress
had
the
foremost
experts
in
the
country
before
it
and
they
were
uniform
in
their
testimony
that
you
need
controlled
test,
you
need
scientifically
sound
evaluation
and
congress
heeded
their
advice
and
congress
enacted
in
the
statute
a
specific
requirement
of
adequate
and
well-controlled
investigations
a
concrete
objective
requirement.
now
it
simply
is
it
seems
to
us
totally
irrational
to
suppose
that
after
congress
went
to
all
the
trouble
of
adopting
this
standard
and
rejecting
these
kinds
of
unscientific
impressions
that
people
have
because
they
use
the
drug
a
few
times
and
it
seem
good
to
them
and
so
did
their
colleagues,
but
the
drug
should
turn
around
and
be
able
to
stay
on
the
market,
that
is
the
commissioner
has
evaluated.
he
has
found
that
won’t.
the
drug
doesn't
have
sub-scientifically
sound
evidence
of
effectiveness.
now
the
manufacturer
turns
around
and
says,
well,
that's
very
interesting,
that's
fine.
i
am
going
to
go
ahead
and
market
it
anyway
and
i
can
produce
10
or
15
doctors
who
will
tell
you
that
they
think
it's
effective
on
the
basis
of
their
uncontrolled,
unscientific
experience.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
just
a
word
or
two
with
respect
to
mr.
williams
and
then
i'll
turn
it
over
to
mr.
hoffman.
the
hemsworth
and
dieckmann
(ph)
studies
were
significantly
different
in
the
sense
that
they
were
controlled
and
i
think
if
you
understand
and
look
at
the
studies
you
will
see
this.
they
took
the
group
of
patients
in
the
studies
and
they
split
them
into
two
groups
and
they
paired
them
in
order
to
eliminate
the
differences
between
the
two
groups.
it's
true
that
they
got
other
medication
apart
from
des
but
both
groups
got
the
same
medication.
they
were
comparable
as
much
as
could
reasonably
be
made
possible
except
that
one
group
had
des
and
one
didn't
and
i
think
that
is
a
significant
difference.
with
respect
to
justice
white's
point
regarding
the
burden
of
the
commissioner
to
come
forward
that
issue
was
tried
and
challenged
by
pma,
it’s
the
(inaudible)
regulations
in
the
pharmaceutical
manufactures
association
of
which
hynson
is
a
member
and
it
was
adjudicated
in
favor
of
the
commissioner.
also
the
ciba-geigy
case
in
the
second
circuit
upheld
the
commissioner's
view
on
that
position,
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
this
holding
in
this
case
that
'me-too'
drugs
are
exempted
as
compelled
by
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
and
as
i
listen
to
mr.
hoffman,
he
is
urging
you
to
feel
compelled
by
the
same
literal
language
of
the
statute
regardless
of
how
absurd
the
results,
but
the
whole
house
of
cards
that
congress
erected
fall
down
on
our
heads,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
requires
it.
now
we
submit
that
the
language
of
section
107
(c)
(4)
in
no
way
compels
an
exemption
of
'me-too'
and
indeed,
that
the
only
sensible
way
you
can
read
the
provision
does
not
exempt
to
products.
it
treats
them
in
the
same
way
as
the
products
that
were
named
in
the
new
drug
application.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it's
very
significant
if
you
will
turn
to
the
statute,
i
rely
not
on
the
statute
that
mr.
hoffman
read
to
you
in
which
he
inserted
the
word
product
in
place
of
drugs,
i
rely
on
section
107
©
(4).
now
section
107
©
(4)
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
page
482,
it
does
not
say
in
the
case
of
any
product
which
was
not
covered
by
an
effective
application.
it
says
in
the
case
of
any
drug.
now,
the
drug
here
is
bioflavonoids,
the
product
is
bivam.
now
there
isn't
anything
here
on
this
page,
in
this
statute
that
compels
you
to
read
that
to
say
bivam
instead
of
bioflavonoids
and
if
you
read
it
in
the
generic
sense
that
we
are
urge
in
our
brief,
everything
falls
in
place
and
you
have
a
coherent
in
sense
of
s
statutory
claim.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
because
it
depends
on
the
degree
of
similarity
of
the
product.
you
can
have
and
in
many
cases
you
have
a
product
that
is
identical
in
everything,
but
the
brand
name
and
under
the
court
of
appeals,
reading
that
product
would
be
the
'me-too'.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now
there
is
an
issue
in
some
cases
as
there
is
in
the
bentex
case
for
instance,
as
to
whether
you
may
really
be
dealing
with
a
different
drug
that
is
not
the
same
drug
that
was
covered
by
the
new
drug
application,
but
the
position
of
the
agency
and
it
has
been
explained
in
its
drug
efficacy
study
implementation
regulations
of
october
1972
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
is
basically
that
identical,
similar
or
related
products
and
this
is
defined
by
chemical
composition
and
therapeutic
use.
it's
a
scientific
concept
which
has
parameters
which
i
can’t
really
get
into
today
and
there
can
be
factual
issues
as
to
whether
a
particular
product
is
in
the
same
generic
family
with
the
drug
discovered
by
the
nda.
now,
if
section
107(c)(4)
is
construed
in
the
way
usv
urges
in
an
individual
product
sense,
the
results
are
irrational;
they
are
discriminatory
among
manufacturers.
they
are
completely
disruptive
of
the
congressional
purpose
and
requiring
that
drugs
be
shown
to
be
effective
for
their
claim
uses.
now
let
me
give
you
scenario
of
what
would
happen.
sometime
between
1938
and
1962,
a
manufacturer
decides
there
are
certain
compound
is
useful
for
the
treatment
of
a
certain
disease
or
condition.
he
does
studies
on
regarding
the
safety
of
that
compound
and
he
files
an
application
with
fda,
which
reviews
his
application
and
allows
it
to
go
into
effect.
he
then
starts
manufacturing
that
product.
now
two
or
three
or
five
other
manufacturers
may
decide
that
they
also
want
to
market
the
same
product
and
if
it's
not
patent,
they
are
free
to
do
so
except
they
have
to
file
their
own
applications
until
such
time
as
the
drug
comes
to
be
generally
recognized
as
safe,
which
it
comes
to
be
because
there
have
been
nda
products
out
on
the
market
that
are
generically
the
same
and
at
that
point
any
manufacturer
can
market
his
product
without
going
through
the
regulatory
procedure
and
that
includes
the
nda
holder
who
can
put
it
out
under
different
brand
names
or
anything
else.
now,
the
ratio
of
these
'me-too'
products
to
the
products
that
are
named
in
the
application
is
quite
high.
fda
has
found
that
it's
high
as
13:1;
in
the
bentex
case,
we
have
23
manufacturers
of
'me-too'
products
and
only
two
manufacturers
who
held
nda’s.
now
under
the
1962
amendments,
congress
said
review
these
nda’s,
determine
the
efficacy
if
these
drugs
and
the
agency
does
it
and
the
agency
finds
under
the
standards
that
congress
has
established
that
the
drugs
are
ineffective
or
that
they
lack
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness,
which
is
somewhat
different
and
it
withdraws
approval
of
the
nda’s
and
it
takes
the
pioneer
drugs
off
the
market
and
here
are
20
other
manufacturers,
still
on
the
market
with
the
identical
product
sitting
in
the
drug
store
shelves.
nothing
has
been
accomplished
for
the
consumer,
nothing
has
been
accomplished,
but
a
completely
irrational
discrimination
between
identically
situated
people
that
does
not
correspond
to
any
regulatory
purpose
that
congress
had.
now,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicates
this
was
congress's
intent.
mr.
hoffman
relies
on
something
in
part
two
of
the
senate
report
when
he
says
that
they
were
concerned
with
new
claims.
he
omits
in
his
brief
and
he
omitted
to
mention
in
his
argument,
the
closing
sentence
of
that
paragraph
which
says
the
effect
of
this
amendment
on
drugs
already
on
the
market
is
discussed
below
under
transitional
provisions.
so
that
the
paragraph
on
which
he
relies
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
effect
of
the
amendment
of
section
201
on
drugs
already
on
the
market
in
1962.
now
he
says,
well
let's
rely
and
the
industry
says,
let's
rely
on
the
power
of
fda
as
a
prosecutor
with
the
aid
of
the
department
of
justice
to
go
chasing
these
people
in
the
courts
with
these
very
serious
remedies.
and
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
tried
to
point
out
to
the
court
some
of
the
practical
problems
that
exist.
but
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
now,
is
that
congress
when
they
passed
the
1962
amendments
expressed
a
concern
with
the
inadequacy
of
the
judicial
remedies.
they
said,
even
where
the
effectiveness,
this
is
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
house
report
hr
24/64,
page
3,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
“even
where
the
effectiveness
of
the
new
drug
enters
into
determining
its
safety,
the
food
and
drug
administration
cannot,
if
it
finds
the
drug
safe,
refuse
clearance
because
the
claim
of
effectiveness
is
exaggerated,”
that's
under
the
old
statute.
“rather
the
administration
would
have
to
stultify
itself
by
allowing
clearance
and
then
causing
court
action
to
be
brought
for
mis-branding.”
committee
goes
on
to
note
“as
a
result
of
good
medical
practice
is
hampered
and
the
consumer
is
mislead
until
perhaps
years
later
the
government
has
gathered
the
necessary
evidence
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proving
the
violation
in
courts.”
that
is
what
congress
was
concerned
about,
when
it
sought
to
bring
these
drugs
under
the
regulatory
scheme
for
evaluation
of
drug
ethics.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
and
in
a
similar
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
the
administrative
proceeding
the
burden
is
clearly
on
the
manufacturer.
he
must
demonstrate
that
there
exists
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
and
i
think
that's
the
only
way
it
could
be;
there
is
no
practical
way
for
the
commissioner
to
demonstrate
the
non
existence
of
such
evidence.
i
don't
know
how
he
would
go
about
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that's
correct
and
that's
of
significant
difference
in
the
terms
of
the
discrimination
between
the
pioneer
and
the
''me-too'.'
the
pioneer
is
being
made
to
show
to
the
agency's
satisfaction
that
there
exists
substantial
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
in
the
'me-too'
if
the
fda
could
ever
chase
after
and
collar
all
of
them
all
over
the
country
in
these
thousands
of
individual
suits,
the
burden
would
be
on
fda
to
establish
their
ineffectiveness
in
mis-branding
action.
now
the
structure
of
the
62
amendments
of
107
(c)
(4)
clearly
supports
our
position,
107
(c)
(4)
talks
about
the
applicability
of
the
revised
definition
of
new
drug
in
201
(p).
nobody
has
told
you
and
nobody
will
tell
you
that
the
definition
in
201
(p)
is
an
individual
product
sense.
it's
generic
and
plain
common
sense
tells
us
to
interpret
section
107
(c)
(4)
for
generically
also.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
