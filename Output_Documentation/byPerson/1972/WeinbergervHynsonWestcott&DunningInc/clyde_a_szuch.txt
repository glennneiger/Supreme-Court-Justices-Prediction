mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
continues
to
refer
to
a
threshold
issue
in
connection
with
approvals
of
the
new
drug
applications.
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
threshold
issue,
something
must
be
decided.
it
would
be
our
position
that
in
connection
with
the
prosecutions
and
filings
of
new
drug
applications,
there
is
in
fact
no
threshold
issue,
because
there
is
no
jurisdictional
issue
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
decide.
if
we
--
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
issue
of
new
drug,
old
drug,
only
comes
about
in
connection
with
actions
of
enforcements,
such
as
seizures,
prosecutions,
criminal
natures
or
injunctions
brought
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
after
it
has
concluded
independent
of
a
new
drug
application,
that
the
product
out
there
in
the
market
is
in
fact
a
new
product
within
the
meaning
of
section
201
(p),
as
opposed
to
section
505
of
the
act.
if
one
looks
at
section
505
and
one
examines
what
actually
happens,
i
believe
that
the
threshold
issue
will
disappear.
when
a
manufacturer
has
a
drug
which
it
wishes
to
market
it
has
the
initial
obligation
of
determining
whether
the
drug
is
new
or
old.
if
he
decides,
or
it
decides
that
the
drug
is
in
fact
a
new
drug,
it
then
goes
to
the
administration
and
files
a
new
drug
application
seeking
approval
of
that
application.
once
the
new
drug
application
has
been
presented
to
the
administration,
there
is
no
longer
any
issue
before
it,
as
to
whether
that
drug
is
a
new
or
an
old
drug.
the
manufacturer
says
nothing
in
it's
application
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
on
that
issue.
the
statute
calls
for
nothing
on
that
issue.
the
matter
is
put
before
the
authority.
it
decides
and
then
we
are
off.
taking
the
other
situation
of
the
withdrawal;
the
fact
that
the
drug
is
new
or
old
is
irrelevant
to
whether
the
food
and
drug
should
withdraw
it's
approval
of
the
nda
which
may
be
filed.
for
example,
even
if
one
were
to
assume,
and
concede,
the
government
and
the
manufacturer,
that
the
drug
were
an
old
drug,
if
the
manufacturer
were
not
filing
the
requisite
reports
required
by
505,
it
seems
mandatory
that
approval
of
the
new
drug
application
be
withdrawn
for
that
reason.
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
option
in
the
statute
we
would
submit,
which
would
authorize
the
administrator
to
decide
that
he
is
not
going
to
act
in
this
particular
instance
to
not
withdraw,
because
the
drug
is
old.
similarly
there
--
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
he
may
do
it
but
the
fact
--
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
and
he
has
done
it,
but
the
fact
that
he
has
done
it,
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
would
permit
him
to
do
it,
we
would
suggest
mr.
justice.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no,
it
does
not,
because
a
manufacturer
with
an
old
drug
may
choose
to
file
a
new
drug
application
form,
with
the
authority
to
get
the
comfort
that
the
approval
--
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no,
we
will
file
this
for
a
ruling
that
the
material
for
an
approval
of
the
new
drug
application,
which
would
not
involve
the
issue
of
whether
the
drug
were
new
or
not
new.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
it
is
a
mass
--
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
if
you
go
to
them,
they
are
prepared
apparently
to
give
you
an
advice
or
opinion
on
whether
you
have
an
old
drug
or
a
new
drug.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
and
they
have
done
so.
on
the
other
hand
if
a
manufacturer
simply
comes
in
with
a
new
drug
application
and
lays
it
down
and
says,
i
want
approval
of
this,
then
whether
it's
new
or
old,
has
in
affect
been
determined
by
the
manufacturer,
and
in
that
approval
procedure
he
puts
nothing
forward
on
the
issue.
as
i
understand
it
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
never
requested
any
information
on
that
subject
in
connection
with
the
approval
process.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
new
or
old
drug.
it
is
only
when
the
advisory
opinion
has
been
sought,
that
that
issue
seems
to
have
been
determined
by
the
government.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
therefore
we
would
submit
that
to
discuss
threshold
is
wrong.
505
does
not
in
any
way
involve
the
issue
of
whether
the
drug
is
new
or
old.
the
approval
of
a
new
drug
application
we
submit,
has
to
be
approved
or
disapproved,
whether
the
drug
involved
is
new
or
old.
on
the
other
hand,
once
a
manufacturer
puts
into
commerce
his
product
and
there
is
not
an
approved
new
drug
application
on
file
for
that
product,
the
fda
may
decide
for
itself
that
the
product
is
in
fact
a
new
product.
this
decision
would
be
under
section
201
(p)
of
the
statute
which
defines
whether
a
product
is
a
new
or
an
old
drug.
now
here
under
201
(p)
proof
is
required
that
there
is
not
general
recognition
amongst
experts
that
the
product
is
safe
and
effective.
if
that
proof
does
not
exist,
the
product
is
new.
the
government
suggests
that
it's
incongruous
that
there
would
be
two
different
schemes
and
two
different
approaches
to
this
issue.
we
would
submit
however
that
there
is
logic
to
this
dual
route
on
this
issue.
number
one,
the
statute
doesn't
put
this
issue
before
the
government
under
505.
number
two,
the
201
(p)
test
applies
to
a
limited
number
of
drugs,
those
that
were
being
marketed
between
38
and
62.
now
as
to
those
drugs,
congress
could
well
have
concluded
that
the
field
of
expertise
present
in
the
people
out
in
the
countryside
working
with
the
products
that
were
out
there
every
day
that
there
were
experts
comparable
to
the
kinds
of
experts
that
the
administration
could
find
in
their
own
administrative
proceedings
and
we
would
suggest
that
it
was
concluded
that
the
field
of
expertise
was
not
exclusive
to
the
agency.
we
are
not
dealing
with
products
or
items
that
are
peculiar
to
an
agency's
expertise.
after
all,
this
is
medicine.
all
the
expertise
on
that
subject
is
not
vested
in
the
fda.
there
is
a
vast
reservoir
and
storehouse
acknowledge
in
this
area,
in
the
hospitals,
in
the
colleges
and
universities.
and
we
would
submit
that
congress
in
effect
said
that
if
those
people
that
are
out
there
working
with
the
products,
not
the
lay
bee,
but
people
who
are
expert
in
their
field,
if
those
people
concluded
that
this
product
was
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective
then
that
product
could
be
marketed
and
that
a
manufacturer
need
not
go
before
fda
and
produce
reams
of
evidence
on
useless
issues.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no
i
cannot,
because
essentially
i
think
that
the
structure
here
is
peculiar
because
of
the
subject
matter
with
which
we
are
dealing,
sec,
labor
board
and
agencies
of
that
type
or
dealing
with
statutory
problems,
statutorily
created
agencies,
that
are
dealing
with
statutory
problems
that
have
gained
expertise
and
knowledge
over
the
years
in
a
limited
area.
medicine
was
being
practiced
long
before
we
decided
we
ought
to
have
an
fda
or
government
regulation
and
for
that
reason
i
think
it
is
different
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
counterpart
to
it
in
any
other
agency.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
yes
i
do
because
i
don't
think
that
the
1962
amendments
mr.
chief
justice
changed
the
procedure
with
respect
to
how
the
fda
processed
new
drug
applications
other
than
to
add
the
one
issue
of
efficacy,
but
the
procedural
mechanisms
of
how
the
inquiry
by
the
fda
began
is
identical
pre
62
as
post
62.
pre
62
only
involve
the
issue
of
safety,
but
it
was
the
manufacture
that
triggered
the
process
of
the
nda
by
coming
in
and
asking
for
approval
of
it.
post
62,
the
situation
procedurally
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
it
is
that.
it
has
gone
up
dramatically
for
all
kinds
of
reasons,
but
the
the
fact
that
the
number
of
drugs
has
gone
up,
i
would
submit
does
not
negate
the
fact,
that
there
are
people
who
are
just
as
equipped
to
determine
whether
a
drug
is
safe
and
effective
under
201
(p)
standard
as
the
nas
people
were
under
the
substantial
evidence
of
efficacy
standard
and
505.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no,
not
exactly,
because
under
the
201
(p)
standard
where
you
must
establish
a
general
recognition
of
safety
and
efficacy,
it
is
still
incumbent
upon
a
manufacturer
to
produce
evidence
through
experts
recognized
as
presumably
to
testify
that
the
proposition
that
this
particular
product
is
safe
and
effective.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no,
no,
no,
no,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
so
called
anecdotal
evidence.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
right,
i
think
the
anecdotal
evidence,
it
would
be
on
a
totally
different
plain,
as
i
would
understand
it,
that's
either
that
the
local
pharmacists
or
the
local
patient
or
a
particular
doctor
who
is
not
qualified,
qualify
generally,
but
not
qualified
particularly
from
an
expert
point
of
view
to
testify,
is
not
that
type
of
evidence
that
201
(p)
is
looking
for
under
the
test.
201
(p)
as
set
for
the
page
475
of
the
joint
appendix
says
that
the
experts
must
be
qualified
by
scientific
training
and
experience
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
the
drugs
as
safe
and
effective
for
use
under
the
conditions
prescribed.
so
that
it
is
incumbent
to
produce
people
with
this
high
level
of
skill
which
we
would
submit
will
result
in
no
lesser
consideration
of
whether
the
drug
is
in
fact
safe
or
effective
than
the
standard
which
is
found
under
505.
it
is
just
an
alternate
method
of
arriving
at
the
same
result
if
you
would.
i
turn
over
to,
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court,
the
balance
of
this
argument
to
mr.
thomas.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
continues
to
refer
to
a
threshold
issue
in
connection
with
approvals
of
the
new
drug
applications.
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
threshold
issue,
something
must
be
decided.
it
would
be
our
position
that
in
connection
with
the
prosecutions
and
filings
of
new
drug
applications,
there
is
in
fact
no
threshold
issue,
because
there
is
no
jurisdictional
issue
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
decide.
if
we
--
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
issue
of
new
drug,
old
drug,
only
comes
about
in
connection
with
actions
of

such
as

a

within
the
meaning
of
section
201

as
opposed
to
section
505
of
the

if
one
looks
at
section
505
and
one
examines
what
actually
happens,
i
believe
that
the
threshold
issue
will
disappear.
when
a

a

there

the

the

calls

the

it
decides
and
then
we
are

taking
the

of
the

the

that
the

irrelevant
to
whether

withdraw
it's

may

for

even
if
one
were
to

and

the

and
the

that
the

if
the
manufacturer
were
not

the
requisite
reports
required
by
505,
it
seems
mandatory
that
approval
of
the

application
be
withdrawn
for
that
reason.
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
option
in
the
statute
we
would
submit,
which
would
authorize
the
administrator
to
decide
that
he
is
not
going
to
act
in
this
particular
instance
to
not
withdraw,
because
the
drug
is
old.
similarly
there
--
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
he
may
do
it
but
the
fact
--
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
and
he
has
done
it,
but
the
fact
that
he
has
done
it,
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
would
permit
him
to
do
it,
we
would
suggest
mr.
justice.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no,
it
does
not,
because
a
manufacturer
with
an
old
drug
may
choose
to
file
a
new
drug
application
form,
with
the
authority
to
get
the

201
(p)
test
applies
to
a
limited
number
of
drugs,
those
that
were
being
marketed
between
38
and
62.
now
as
to
those
drugs,
congress
could
well
have
concluded
that
the
field
of
expertise
present
in
the
people
out
in
the
countryside
working
with
the
products
that
were
out
there
every
day
that
there
were
experts
comparable
to
the
kinds
of
experts
that
the
administration
could
find
in
their
own
administrative
proceedings
and
we
would
suggest
that
it
was
concluded
that
the
field
of
expertise
was
not
exclusive
to
the
agency.
we
are
not
dealing
with
products
or
items
that
are
peculiar
to
an
agency's
expertise.
after
all,
this
is
medicine.
all
the
expertise
on
that
subject
is
not
vested
in
the
fda.
there
is
a
vast
reservoir
and
storehouse
acknowledge
in
this
area,
in
the
hospitals,
in
the
colleges
and
universities.
and
we
would
submit
that
congress
in
effect
said
that
if
those
people
that
are
out
there
working
with
the
products,
not
the
lay
bee,
but
people
who
are
expert
in
their
field,
if
those
people
concluded
that
this
product
was
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective
then
that
product
could
be
marketed
and
that
a
manufacturer
need
not
go
before
fda
and
produce
reams
of
evidence
on
useless
issues.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no
i
cannot,
because
essentially
i
think
that
the
structure
here
is
peculiar
because
of
the
subject
matter
with
which
we
are
dealing,
sec,
labor
board
and
agencies
of
that
type
or
dealing
with
statutory
problems,
statutorily
created
agencies,
that
are
dealing
with
statutory
problems
that
have
gained
expertise
and
knowledge
over
the
years
in
a
limited
area.
medicine
was
being
practiced
long
before
we
decided
we
ought
to
have
an
fda
or
government
regulation
and
for
that
reason
i
think
it
is
different
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
counterpart
to
it
in
any
other
agency.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
yes
i
do
because
i
don't
think
that
the
1962
amendments
mr.
chief
justice
changed
the
procedure
with
respect
to
how
the
fda
processed
new
drug
applications
other
than
to
add
the
one
issue
of
efficacy,
but
the
procedural
mechanisms
of
how
the
inquiry
by
the
fda
began
is
identical
pre
62
as
post
62.
pre
62
only
involve
the
issue
of
safety,
but
it
was
the
manufacture
that
triggered
the
process
of
the
nda
by
coming
in
and
asking
for
approval
of
it.
post
62,
the
situation
procedurally
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
it
is
that.
it
has
gone
up
dramatically
for
all
kinds
of
reasons,
but
the
the
fact
that
the
number
of
drugs
has
gone
up,
i
would
submit
does
not
negate
the
fact,
that
there
are
people
who
are
just
as
equipped
to
determine
whether
a
drug
is
safe
and
effective
under
201
(p)
standard
as
the
nas
people
were
under
the
substantial
evidence
of
efficacy
standard
and
505.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no,
not
exactly,
because
under
the
201
(p)
standard
where
you
must
establish
a
general
recognition
of
safety
and
efficacy,
it
is
still
incumbent
upon
a
manufacturer
to
produce
evidence
through
experts
recognized
as
presumably
to
testify
that
the
proposition
that
this
particular
product
is
safe
and
effective.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
no,
no,
no,
no,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
so
called
anecdotal
evidence.
mr.
clyde
a.
szuch
right,
i
think
the
anecdotal
evidence,
it
would
be
on
a
totally
different
plain,
as
i
would
understand
it,
that's
either
that
the
local
pharmacists
or
the
local
patient
or
a
particular
doctor
who
is
not
qualified,
qualify
generally,
but
not
qualified
particularly
from
an
expert
point
of
view
to
testify,
is
not
that
type
of
evidence
that
201
(p)
is
looking
for
under
the
test.
201
(p)
as
set
for
the
page
475
of
the
joint
appendix
says
that
the
experts
must
be
qualified
by
scientific
training
and
experience
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
the
drugs
as
safe
and
effective
for
use
under
the
conditions
prescribed.
so
that
it
is
incumbent
to
produce
people
with
this
high
level
of
skill
which
we
would
submit
will
result
in
no
lesser
consideration
of
whether
the
drug
is
in
fact
safe
or
effective
than
the
standard
which
is
found
under
505.
it
is
just
an
alternate
method
of
arriving
at
the
same
result
if
you
would.
i
turn
over
to,
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court,
the
balance
of
this
argument
to
mr.
thomas.
