justice
thurgood
marshall
what
worries
me
about
this
new
drug,
number
one,
it's
not
a
new
drug?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
i
know,
but
that’s
what
gets
me
confused.
suppose
the
'me-too'
drug
has
an
additional
ingredient
in
it,
which
makes
it
effective?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
does
he
get
a
chance?
as
i
understand
is,
as
soon
as
his
nda
people
lose
there,
he
automatically
loses
his?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
one
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
in
one
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
don't
agree
that
the
1962
act
was
to
scrap
the
fda?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
did
change
the
procedure
by
putting
specifically
what
they
meant
by
the
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
there
is
a
off
set
you
have
in
the
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
the
district
court
could
you
use
the
same
criteria?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
where
i
am
confused.
you
say
that
you
want
to
go
to
the
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
couldn't
you
do
better
with
the
fda
under
those
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
somebody
really
says
you
haven't
shown
any
thing
to
change
my
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
is
that
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
only
quarrel
is
that
you
keep
saying
that
this
question
to
make
a
decision
is
so
unbiased,
etcetera,
etcetera,
he
has
already
made
up
his
mind,
hadn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
i
am
talking
about
this
one,
he
has
made
up
his
mind
and
your
burden
is
to
give
him
something.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
finish.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
burden
on
you
is
to
show
something
that
will
make
his
mind
be
neutral?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
really
what
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
you
produce
something
and
he
might
say,
ah,
i
might
have
made
a
mistake?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
assume
that
this
one
is
not
in
that
category,
this
one
is
--
this
is
the
one
where
50-60
or
50-40
or
something
like
that,
this
is
a
close
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
i
am
talking
about
if
there
is
a
close
one
andyou
are
up
against
a
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind,
you
got
a
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
i
got
a
real
close
case,
i
wouldn't
want
to
burden
or
convince
the
man
that
he
was
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
williams
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
dr.
majewski
whatever
these
many,
didn’t
make
the
studies
as
went
back
in
his
file?
justice
thurgood
marshall
tell
me
where
it
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
other
physicians?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
were
they
making
the
study?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
all
a
new
protox
study?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
the
study
of
their
files
of
past
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
did
he
work
on
this
study?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
does
have
to
make
the
controlled
study?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
you
said
that
you
didn't
agree
with
that,
and
you
do
agree
with
that
for
a
new
drug?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
is
your
definition
with
new
drug,
the
statute's
definition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
62
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
subject
to
the

justice
thurgood
