justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
freedman,
when
you
talk
about
drugs,
you
mean,
something
more
than
just
an
identical
chemical
compound
that
has
a
different
trade
name,
you
mean
something
that
has
a
similar,
but
not
identical
chemical
compound
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
freedman,
does
the
statute
give
the
commissioner
expressly
authority
to
define
by
regulation
the
statutory
language
in
505
(d)
pertaining
to
"substantial
evidence."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
rule
making
hearing
mr.
freedman,
you
are
not
talking
about
a
hearing
whose
ultimate
object
is
to
promulgate
a
rule,
are
you?
you
are
talking
about
a
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
adjudicating
particular
facts
with
respect
to
these
drugs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
fourth
circuit
rule
of
food
and
drug
can
refer
for
prosecution,
it
can
initiate
in
that
matter,
can't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
food
and
drug
administration
have
any
authority
to
issue
seize
and
desist
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
of
those
proceedings
are
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
is
appellate
review
of
the
action
of
the
fda
based
on
some
section
in
the
food
and
drug
act
or
on
the
administrative
procedure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
the
commissioner's
regulation
dealing
with
the
existence
of
grounds
for
summary
judgment,
do
they
as
interpreted,
exclude
only
the
possibility
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
such
a
situation
or
do
they
also
exclude
the
possibility
of
oral
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
manufacturer
then
could
have
had
an
oral
argument
at
least
before
the
bureau
of
drugs,
although
he
might
have
been
precluded
from
offering
any
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
would
have
been
subsequently
discovered
evidence,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
he
would
located
the
evidence.
in
the
meanwhile
he
couldn't
go
back
in
on
the
same
stuff
he
had
before
and
get
any
more
than
he
did
the
first
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
whole
summary
judgment
procedure
in
a
court
although
it's
premised
exactly
on
the
type
of
reasoning
you
use,
the
judge
doesn't
simply
say,
i
have
decided
to
grant
summary
judgment
in
this
case,
someone
makes
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
parties
come
in
and
argue
as
to
whether
there
is
or
there
is
not
a
substantial
issue
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
read
505
(b)
then
in
its
definition
of
substantial
evidence
to
say
that
nothing
that
does
not
include
clinical
investigations
can
be
substantial
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
clinical
investigation
if
it
meets
the
other
definitions
that
are
adequate
and
well-controlled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
this
sounds
to
me
like
the
kind
of
analysis
you
are
engaging,
it
sounds
to
me
as
it
would
be
a
very
legitimate
type
of
thing
for
the
commissioner
to
do
after
a
hearing,
weighing
this
test
against
the
other,
but
i
have
some
doubt
as
to
just
excluding
it
at
the
threshold?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
might
not
be
at
least
possible
that
doctor
majewski
having
setup
these
studies
would
have
some
defense
for
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
part
of
your
complaint
here
is
that
you
were
denied
certain
procedural
rights
before
the
commission
that
you
thought
you
ought
to
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
would
you
have
sought
to
show
at
the
hearing
had
you
been
accorded?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
do
mean
an
opportunity
to
put
these
witnesses
on
the
stand
and
do
you
also
mean
our
alternatively
mean
an
opportunity
that
will
orally
argue
your
contentions
about
your
written
submissions
before
the
administrator?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
not
--
there
have
been
cases
from
this
court
and
i
think
one
of
the
most
recent
was
united
state
versus
florida
east
cost
railroad
that
certainly
intimate
that
you
don’t
necessarily
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
government
staff,
agency
personnel.
now
this
was
the
ruling.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
would
regard
the
academy
findings
here
as
being
basically
analogous
to
outside
specialists
as
opposed
to
staff
personnel
of
the
agency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
even
if
you
had
all
sorts
of
witnesses
in
evidentiary
hearing,
the
commissioner
still
would
have
been
prosecutor
or
judge,
wouldn't
he,
i
mean,
that
wouldn't
have
changed
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say,
the
statute
then
or
that
the
statute
or
constitution
would
have
required
not
only
a
hearing
but
before
a
federal
administrative
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
supports
your
view?
is
there
any
specific
provision
of
the
statute
that
you
rely
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
'me-too'
on
its
own
merits
met
the
test
of
the
38
act
for
a
new
drug?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
language
of
the
statute
precisely
of
section
(4)
do
you
rely
at
to
bring
'me-too'
drugs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
our
colloquy
with
mr.
freedman
this
morning,
i
understood
that
the
government’s
definition
of
'me-too'
drug
was
not
just
different
trade
names
for
precisely
the
same
generic
product,
but
similar
products
as
well
as
identical
products?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
the
easy
case
for
you
under
the
grandfather
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
burden
on
the
civil
injunctive
action,
i
take
it
would
be
the
normal
preponderance
of
the
evidence
test
that
you
are
referring
to?
