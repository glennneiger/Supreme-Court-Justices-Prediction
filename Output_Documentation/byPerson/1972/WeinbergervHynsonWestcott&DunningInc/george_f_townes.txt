mr.
george
f.
townes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
regarding
our
products.
they
are
not
“me-too”
products.
we
have
contended
throughout
and
that
issue
is
not
before
you.
the
issue
before
you
in
our
case
is
whether
--
the
question
of
whether
our
products
are
old
drugs
and
when
i
use
the
term
“old
drug,”
i
include
a
drug
which
may
currently
be
generally
recognized
both
as
safe
and
effective
and
drugs
which
enjoy
the
grandfather
provisions
as
to
whether
that
determination
invalidly
be
made
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
some
sort
of
administrative
procedure.
although
the
congress
designated
that
determination
in
an
appropriate
case
to
be
made
solely
by
the
federal
judiciary
starting
with
an
action
in
the
district
court.
mr.
george
f.
townes
no
sir,
it
is
not.
it
is
used
to
say
--
mr.
george
f.
townes
the
phrase
--
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
townes
it
is
not.
mr.
george
f.
townes
now,
let
me
illustrate
the
great
difference
that
is
involved
in
determining
whether
a
drug
is
new
and
determining
whether
a
“new
drug”
application
should
be
approved.
if
my
clients
had
sat
back
and
awaited
enforcement
proceedings
in
a
district
court
as
they
had
the
right
to
do,
it
would
have
been
incumbent
on
the
government
as
prosecutor
against
them
for
selling
an
unapproved
“new
drug”
to
prove
that
the
drug
was
in
fact
new.
now,
under
the
definition
and
under
a
number
of
court
decisions,
the
most
widely
respected
being
the
klikova
(ph)
case
which
is
also
a
very
an
attaining
case
to
read,
the
government
would
produce
two
or
three
or
four
qualified
experts,
typically
chairman
of
particular
medical
department,
well
recognized
specialist.
they
would
be
placed
on
the
stand
and
asked
after
their
qualifications
were
illustrated
to
what
extent
were
they
familiar
with
the
reputation
among
qualified
experts
in
this
field
as
to
the
safety
of
this
product
for
the
uses
that
the
product
is
supposed
to
be
for.
and
they
would
explain
how
they
kept
day-to-day
track
of
the
literature,
they
subscribed
to
many
journals,
they
went
to
many
symposiums,
they
read
many
books,
they
conversed
with
their
colleagues
and
attended
the
meetings
and
they
were
familiar
with
reputation
and
then
he
would
ask
them,
“what
is
it
that
reputation?”
and
he
would
say
well,
nobody
–
frequently
most
drugs
are
pretty
safe
so
let's
this
expert
say
this
one
is
recognized
it
safe
and
then
he
will
be
asked,
“is
it
recognized
as
effective?”
and
he
would
say,
well,
frankly
no,
it
used
to
be
a
long
time
ago.
few
people
thought
it
did
pretty
good
job
and
tried,
there
weren't
any
good
studies
of
it
and
as
time
went
on,
we
realized
that
it
really
didn't
work
and
nobody
pays
attention
to
it
now.
now
that
is
the
government's
case
really
in
so
many
words.
a
manufacturer,
if
he
is
attempting
to
defend
this
case
and
very,
very,
very
few
of
these
cases
either
have
been
defended
or
will
be
defended
because
the
burden
on
the
manufacture
is
extremely
great.
once
that
testimony
has
been
put
up
against,
he
has
got
to,
by
he
is
own
experts
of
equal
statute
really,
if
you
want,
you
have
to
have
equal
statute,
show
that
for
summaries,
the
government
experts
were
mistaken
in
their
estimate
of
their
colleague's
general
opinion.
now
very
few
of
these
cases
in
fact
arise
for
that
simple
reason.
it
would
be
rare
and
it
is
rare
that
you
would
not
immediately
appreciate
what
the
consensus
of
informed
opinion
was
concerning
a
product.
the
klikova
(ph)
case
is
a
case
in
which
the
manufacturer
did
prevail.
there
was
a
virginia
case
and
the
man
had
a
headache
remedy,
he
thought
klikova
(ph)
was
cute
name
for
it,
consisted
of
aspirin
and
caffeine
and
few
other
things
and
it
was
the
government's
position
that
he
was
in
some
way
representing
as
to
the
effective
for
alcoholism.
and
the
court
said,
no,
he
is
just
saying
a
hangover
and
hangover
symptoms
and
aspirin
is
effective
for
headache
and
then
you
have
a
headache
when
you
have
a
hang
over
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
so
out
of
a
number
of
variations
of
this
product,
the
court
did
feel
that
in
one
instance
the
government
was
really
being
too
extreme
and
that
this
was
safe
and
effective
for
that
limited
use.
now
that
is
the
type
of
issue.
this
flood
of
litigation
is
not
going
to
appear.
a
very
few
cases
have
been
litigated
in
the
past.
the
industry
has
always
understood,
this
to
be
a
district
court
issue
and
the
issue
is
this
reputation
of
the
drug
among
the
scientific
community.
now
granted
in
a
trial
the
reputation
will
be
discussed
and
explored
and
what
do
you
--
what
do
your
colleagues
think
it's
not
worth,
but
all
the
court
has
to
pass
on
is
that
reputation.
now
that
is
an
entirely,
entirely
different
issue
from
the
issue
of
whether
a
drug
in
fact
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
safe
and
effective
under
the
criteria
of
section
505,
the
new
drug
application
proceeding.
that
is
a
scientific
question.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
this
branding
procedure
for
example,
congress
itself
puts
on
the
court
certain
burdens
of
passing
on
scientific
questions.
you
are
prosecuted
for
misrepresenting
this
drug
to
be
effective
for
particular
use.
the
government
must
prove
it's
ineffective
under
this
branding.
now,
the
fda
has
died
out
as
a
police
agency,
i
say
the
fda
it's
predecessors
under
the
1906
act.
in
1938,
congress
said,
well,
for
a
new
drugs,
for
new
drugs
let's
require
pre
marketing
clearance.
now
congress
was
talking
about
a
new
drug,
something
new
and
it
came
up
with
a
definition
which
is
as
good
definition
as
you
can
come
up
with.
at
that
point,
a
new
drug
was
defined
as
a
drug
which
qualified
experts
generally
did
not
regard
as
safe
and
it's
a
difficult
definition
to
apply
at
times,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
improve
on
it.
now
as
to
everything
else
in
the
1938
act
pertaining
to
this
general
situation,
there
were
these
police
powers
created.
if
you
ship
a
new
drug
without
approval,
if
you
mis-plan
the
drug,
if
you
adulterate
a
drug,
the
product
can
be
seized
in
a
district
court.
you
can
enjoined
in
the
district
court,
you
can
demand
a
jury
or
you
can
be
prosecuted
in
a
district
court.
mr.
george
f.
townes
it
would
effect
only
the
drug
in
authority.
in
a
seizure
action,
the
marshal
goes
and
takes
a
quantity
of
the
goods.
mr.
george
f.
townes
right.
mr.
george
f.
townes
and
you
may
and
may
not
choose
to
defend
it.
the
true
owner
may
by
this
time
be
the
druggist,
the
manufacturer
may
defend
it,
he
may
not.
injunction
again,
would
be
addressed
towards
such
persons
as
may
be
made
parties
to
the
injunction,
i
can
conclude
that
you
can
make
a
number
of
persons
parties
and
--
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir,
as
many
as
possible.
actually
the
food
and
drug,
i
think
knows
more
than
it
would
admit
as
to
who
makes
what
because
for
a
generation
now
since
back
they
regularly
go
on
to
plants,
picked
up
the
labels
and
everything.
i
just
don't
think
they
had
the
opportunity
to
collect
the
information
as
fully
as
the
new
information
act
would
allow
that
the
information
is
there
in
the
archives.
mr.
george
f.
townes
the
clinical,
yes,
scientific
studies.
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir
it
is
entirely.
mr.
george
f.
townes
not
at
all.
if
i
may
be
so
(inaudible),
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
we
have
a
number
of
cases
of
this
type,
not
declaratory
judgment,
this
is
inverse
seizure
action
or
inverse
injunction
action,
instead
of
wait
for
them
to
come
for
us.
i
think
is
a
public
service
if
we
take
the
position
that
we
arrive
at,
we
bound
together.
we
got
20
people
in
one
suit
with
saying,
you
say
you
are
doing
wrong,
we
are
not
wait
for
you
to
come
after
us,
we
will
find
it
right
now
and
we
should
not
--
the
jurisdiction
should
not
depend
on
whether
we
wait
for
our
product
to
be
seized
or
we
wait
to
be
prosecuted.
jurisdiction
should
be
the
same
whether
the
actions
for
declaratory
judgment
on
these
issues
or
whether
it's
enforcement
action,
there
can't
be
any
difference.
if
there
is
a
difference,
there
is
a
penalty
in
effect
to
the
bringing
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
which
this
would
never
be.
mr.
george
f.
townes
no
sir,
not
as
such.
they
write
two
letters
that
in
their
opinion
you
are
doing
wrong.
now
the
ordinary
response
is
that
you
quit
doing
wrong.
if
you
have
a
valid
disagreement
with
them
and
feel
the
matter
is
capable
of
litigation,
then
you
await
their
seizure,
you
await
their
injunction
or
you
made
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
george
f.
townes
those
are
all
district
court
proceedings.
but
the
issues
are
so
different
in
a
new
drug
application.
you
are
supposed
--
the
--
every
criteria
relates
to
the
results
of
scientific
test
and
the
question
of
whether
a
drug
is
new
or
old,
you
are
talking
about
professor
so
and
so,
yes
i
am
familiar
with
aspirin.
i
know
its
reputation
in
scientific
world.
i
read
volumes
about
it.
i
discussed
it
and
everyone
in
scientific
community
in
my
opinion
recognizes
aspirin
to
be
safe
for
this
purpose.
on
the
other
hand,
i
am
further
familiar
with
acne
remedies
to
use
mr.
freedman's
example
and
i
am
familiar
with
aspirin
and
in
my
opinion
no
one
in
the
scientific
world
recognizes
aspirin
to
be
effective
for
acne.
so
the
resulting
holding
by
the
court
is
that
aspirin
is
now
recognized
as
safe
for
the
treatment
of
acne,
aspirin
is
not
only
recognized
as
effective
for
the
treatment
for
acne.
mr.
george
f.
townes
the
1962
act
made
no
change
as
to
jurisdiction,
absolutely
none.
it
said
from
now
on
new
drug
applications
must
contain
evidence
of
effectiveness.
mr.
george
f.
townes
they
changed
what
they
meant
by
evidence
of
effectiveness
as
relates
to
the
criterion
in
a
new
drug
application,
to
add
effectiveness,
to
add
the
criteria
of
effectiveness.
now
let
me
point
out
what
those
criteria
--
those
criteria
are
quite
interesting.
mr.
george
f.
townes
that
it
off
sets
in
more
senses
than
one
mr.
justice.
the
congress
was
concerned
that
a
drug
like
genoas
(ph)
vaccine
or
penasoms
(ph)
early
days,
might
be
generally
effective,
but
repudiated
by
medical
community
which
does
have
its
academic
biases.
so
what
it
said
was
if
you
can
produce
proper
case
which
will
lead
a
competent
observer
to
come
to
a
--
get
exact
price,
but
a
proper
conclusion
that
this
is
effective
and
then
everybody
may
disagree
with
you.
the
scientific
community
may
not
reach
the
results
he
reached,
but
i
think
in
good
faith
he
could
reach
these
results
eventually
it
allowed
to
be
marketed.
so
actually
substantial
evidence
test
in
many
senses
is
the
word,
is
an
expansion
of
the
right
of
innovation
and
experiment.
mr.
george
f.
townes
no
sir,
in
the
district
court
the
question
is
do
experts
generally
in
the
field
--
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
townes
well,
you
got
two
problems,
mr.
justice.
one
is
that
these
are
not
the
people,
my
clients
are
not
the
people
that
developed
these
products
originally.
while
they
have
and
that
is
certain,
little
test
of
their
own,
they
are
not
tested
adequately
to
meet
these
standards.
now
if
we
can
show
that
the
community
generally
recognizes
this
product
to
be
both
safe
and
effective
then
our
whole
test
is
much
sample
than
that.
now
this
general
reputation
of
proof
is
both
a
terrible
burden
in
the
sense
that
you
got
to
get
qualified
academic
people
who
say
yes,
everybody
knows
this
drug,
it's
good
it
works.
this
is
a
way
it
should
regarded.
if
you
can
get
that
which
is
a
terrific
word
than
the
method
of
proof
is
very
simple.
you
pull
in
your
three
witnesses,
they
testify
for
a
morning
or
so
and
you
do
not
have
to
go
through
all
these
all
these
elaborate
testing
procedures
and
so
forth,
because
the
community
accepts
the
drug.
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
townes
well
sir
if
i
were
to
start
advertising
aspirin
for
sale
for
acne
today
and
i
would
be
prosecuted
for
having
new
drug
without
application.
if
i
resisted
it
will
be
tried
in
the
district
court
but
if
i
wanted
to
get
it
approved
i'd
have
to
go
through
the
new
drug
approval.
mr.
george
f.
townes
they
have
the
prosecutorial
authority
to
do
so.
mr.
george
f.
townes
correct.
mr.
george
f.
townes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
regarding
our
products.
they
are
not
“me-too”
products.
we
have
contended
throughout
and
that
issue
is
not
before
you.
the
issue
before
you
in
our
case
is
whether
--
the
question
of
whether
our
products
are
old
drugs
and
when
i
use
the
term
“old
drug,”
i
include
a
drug
which
may
currently
be
generally
recognized
both
as
safe
and
effective
and
drugs
which
enjoy
the
grandfather
provisions
as
to
whether
that
determination
invalidly
be
made
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
some
sort
of
administrative
procedure.
although
the
congress
designated
that
determination
in
an
appropriate
case
to
be
made
solely
by
the
federal
judiciary
starting
with
an
action
in
the
district
court.
mr.
george
f.
townes
no
sir,
it
is
not.
it
is
used
to
say
--
mr.
george
f.
townes
the
phrase
--
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
townes
it
is
not.
mr.
george
f.
townes
now,
let
me
illustrate
the
great
difference
that
is
involved
in
determining
whether
a
drug
is
new
and
determining
whether
a
“new
drug”
application
should
be
approved.
if
my
clients
had
sat
back
and
awaited
enforcement
proceedings
in
a
district
court
as
they
had
the
right
to
do,
it
would
have
been
incumbent
on
the
government
as
prosecutor
against
them
for
selling
an
unapproved
“new
drug”
to
prove
that
the
drug
was
in
fact
new.
now,
under
the
definition
and
under
a
number
of
court
decisions,
the
most
widely
respected
being
the
klikova
(ph)
case
which
is
also
a
very
an
attaining
case
to
read,
the
government
would
produce
two
or
three
or
four
qualified
experts,
typically
chairman
of
particular
medical
department,
well
recognized
specialist.
they
would
be
placed
on
the
stand
and
asked
after
their
qualifications
were
illustrated
to
what
extent
were
they
familiar
with
the
reputation
among
qualified
experts
in
this
field
as
to
the
safety
of
this
product
for
the
uses
that
the
product
is
supposed
to
be
for.
and
they
would
explain
how
they
kept
day-to-day
track
of
the
literature,
they
subscribed
to
many
journals,
they
went
to
many
symposiums,
they
read
many
books,
they
conversed
with
their
colleagues
and
attended
the
meetings
and
they
were
familiar
with
reputation
and
then
he
would
ask
them,
“what
is
it
that
reputation?”
and
he
would
say
well,
nobody
–
frequently
most
drugs
are
pretty
safe
so
let's
this
expert
say
this
one
is
recognized
it
safe
and
then
he
will
be
asked,
“is
it
recognized
as
effective?”
and
he
would
say,
well,
frankly
no,
it
used
to
be
a
long
time
ago.
few
people
thought
it
did
pretty
good
job
and
tried,
there
weren't
any
good
studies
of
it
and
as
time
went
on,
we
realized
that
it
really
didn't
work
and
nobody
pays
attention
to
it
now.
now
that
is
the
government's
case
really
in
so
many
words.
a
manufacturer,
if
he
is
attempting
to
defend
this
case
and
very,
very,
very
few
of
these
cases
either
have
been
defended
or
will
be
defended
because
the
burden
on
the
manufacture
is
extremely
great.
once
that
testimony
has
been
put
up
against,
he
has
got
to,
by
he
is
own
experts
of
equal
statute
really,
if
you
want,
you
have
to
have
equal
statute,
show
that
for
summaries,
the
government
experts
were
mistaken
in
their
estimate
of
their
colleague's
general
opinion.
now
very
few
of
these
cases
in
fact
arise
for
that
simple
reason.
it
would
be
rare
and
it
is
rare
that
you
would
not
immediately
appreciate
what
the
consensus
of
informed
opinion
was
concerning
a
product.
the
klikova
(ph)
case
is
a
case
in
which
the
manufacturer
did
prevail.
there
was
a
virginia
case
and
the
man
had
a
headache
remedy,
he
thought
klikova
(ph)
was
cute
name
for
it,
consisted
of
aspirin
and
caffeine
and
few
other
things
and
it
was
the
government's
position
that
he
was
in
some
way
representing
as
to
the
effective
for
alcoholism.
and
the
court
said,
no,
he
is
just
saying
a
hangover
and
hangover
symptoms
and
aspirin
is
effective
for
headache
and
then
you
have
a
headache
when
you
have
a
hang
over
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
so
out
of
a
number
of
variations
of
this
product,
the
court
did
feel
that
in
one
instance
the
government
was
really
being
too
extreme
and
that
this
was
safe
and
effective
for
that
limited
use.
now
that
is
the
type
of
issue.
this
flood
of
litigation
is
not
going
to
appear.
a
very
few
cases
have
been
litigated
in
the
past.
the
industry
has
always
understood,
this
to
be
a
district
court
issue
and
the
issue
is
this
reputation
of
the
drug
among
the
scientific
community.
now
granted
in
a
trial
the
reputation
will
be
discussed
and
explored
and
what
do
you
--
what
do
your
colleagues
think
it's
not
worth,
but
all
the
court
has
to
pass
on
is
that
reputation.
now
that
is
an
entirely,
entirely
different
issue
from
the
issue
of
whether
a
drug
in
fact
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
safe
and
effective
under
the
criteria
of
section
505,
the
new
drug
application
proceeding.
that
is
a
scientific
question.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
this
branding
procedure
for
example,
congress
itself
puts
on
the
court
certain
burdens
of
passing
on
scientific
questions.
you
are
prosecuted
for
misrepresenting
this
drug
to
be
effective
for
particular
use.
the
government
must
prove
it's
ineffective
under
this
branding.
now,
the
fda
has
died
out
as
a
police
agency,
i
say
the
fda
it's
predecessors
under
the
1906
act.
in
1938,
congress
said,
well,
for
a
new
drugs,
for
new
drugs
let's
require
pre
marketing
clearance.
now
congress
was
talking
about
a
new
drug,
something
new
and
it
came
up
with
a
definition
which
is
as
good
definition
as
you
can
come
up
with.
at
that
point,
a
new
drug
was
defined
as
a
drug
which
qualified
experts
generally
did
not
regard
as
safe
and
it's
a
difficult
definition
to
apply
at
times,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
improve
on
it.
now
as
to
everything
else
in
the
1938
act
pertaining
to
this
general
situation,
there
were
these
police
powers
created.
if
you
ship
a
new
drug
without
approval,
if
you
mis-plan
the
drug,
if
you
adulterate
a
drug,
the
product
can
be
seized
in
a
district
court.
you
can
enjoined
in
the
district
court,
you
can
demand
a
jury
or
you
can
be
prosecuted
in
a
district
court.
mr.
george
f.
townes
it
would
effect
only
the
drug
in
authority.
in
a
seizure
action,
the
marshal
goes
and
takes
a
quantity
of
the
goods.
mr.
george
f.
townes
right.
mr.
george
f.
townes
and
you
may
and
may
not
choose
to
defend
it.
the
true
owner
may
by
this
time
be
the
druggist,
the
manufacturer
may
defend
it,
he
may
not.
injunction
again,
would
be
addressed
towards
such
persons
as
may
be
made
parties
to
the
injunction,
i
can
conclude
that
you
can
make
a
number
of
persons
parties
and
--
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir,
as
many
as
possible.
actually
the
food
and
drug,
i
think
knows
more
than
it
would
admit
as
to
who
makes
what
because
for
a
generation
now
since
back
they
regularly
go
on
to
plants,
picked
up
the
labels
and
everything.
i
just
don't
think
they
had
the
opportunity
to
collect
the
information
as
fully
as
the
new
information
act
would
allow
that
the
information
is
there
in
the
archives.
mr.
george
f.
townes
the
clinical,
yes,
scientific
studies.
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir
it
is
entirely.
mr.
george
f.
townes
not
at
all.
if
i
may
be
so
(inaudible),
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
we
have
a
number
of
cases
of
this
type,
not
declaratory
judgment,
this
is
inverse
seizure
action
or
inverse
injunction
action,
instead
of
wait
for
them
to
come
for
us.
i
think
is
a
public
service
if
we
take
the
position
that
we
arrive
at,
we
bound
together.
we
got
20
people
in
one
suit
with
saying,
you
say
you
are
doing
wrong,
we
are
not
wait
for
you
to
come
after
us,
we
will
find
it
right
now
and
we
should
not
--
the
jurisdiction
should
not
depend
on
whether
we
wait
for
our
product
to
be
seized
or
we
wait
to
be
prosecuted.
jurisdiction
should
be
the
same
whether
the
actions
for
declaratory
judgment
on
these
issues
or
whether
it's
enforcement
action,
there
can't
be
any
difference.
if
there
is
a
difference,
there
is
a
penalty
in
effect
to
the
bringing
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
which
this
would
never
be.
mr.
george
f.
townes
no
sir,
not
as
such.
they
write
two
letters
that
in
their
opinion
you
are
doing
wrong.
now
the
ordinary
response
is
that
you
quit
doing
wrong.
if
you
have
a
valid
disagreement
with
them
and
feel
the
matter
is
capable
of
litigation,
then
you
await
their
seizure,
you
await
their
injunction
or
you
made
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
george
f.
townes
those
are
all
district
court
proceedings.
but
the
issues
are
so
different
in
a
new
drug
application.
you
are
supposed
--
the
--
every
criteria
relates
to
the
results
of
scientific
test
and
the
question
of
whether
a
drug
is
new
or
old,
you
are
talking
about
professor
so
and
so,
yes
i
am
familiar
with
aspirin.
i
know
its
reputation
in
scientific
world.
i
read
volumes
about
it.
i
discussed
it
and
everyone
in
scientific
community
in
my
opinion
recognizes
aspirin
to
be
safe
for
this
purpose.
on
the
other
hand,
i
am
further
familiar
with
acne
remedies
to
use
mr.
freedman's
example
and
i
am
familiar
with
aspirin
and
in
my
opinion
no
one
in
the
scientific
world
recognizes
aspirin
to
be
effective
for
acne.
so
the
resulting
holding
by
the
court
is
that
aspirin
is
now
recognized
as
safe
for
the
treatment
of
acne,
aspirin
is
not
only
recognized
as
effective
for
the
treatment
for
acne.
mr.
george
f.
townes
the
1962
act
made
no
change
as
to
jurisdiction,
absolutely
none.
it
said
from
now
on
new
drug
applications
must
contain
evidence
of
effectiveness.
mr.
george
f.
townes
they
changed
what
they
meant
by
evidence
of
effectiveness
as
relates
to
the
criterion
in
a
new
drug
application,
to
add
effectiveness,
to
add
the
criteria
of
effectiveness.
now
let
me
point
out
what
those
criteria
--
those
criteria
are
quite
interesting.
mr.
george
f.
townes
that
it
off
sets
in
more
senses
than
one
mr.
justice.
the
congress
was
concerned
that
a
drug
like
genoas
(ph)
vaccine
or
penasoms
(ph)
early
days,
might
be
generally
effective,
but
repudiated
by
medical
community
which
does
have
its
academic
biases.
so
what
it
said
was
if
you
can
produce
proper
case
which
will
lead
a
competent
observer
to
come
to
a
--
get
exact
price,
but
a
proper
conclusion
that
this
is
effective
and
then
everybody
may
disagree
with
you.
the
scientific
community
may
not
reach
the
results
he
reached,
but
i
think
in
good
faith
he
could
reach
these
results
eventually
it
allowed
to
be
marketed.
so
actually
substantial
evidence
test
in
many
senses
is
the
word,
is
an
expansion
of
the
right
of
innovation
and
experiment.
mr.
george
f.
townes
no
sir,
in
the
district
court
the
question
is
do
experts
generally
in
the
field
--
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
townes
well,
you
got
two
problems,
mr.
justice.
one
is
that
these
are
not
the
people,
my
clients
are
not
the
people
that
developed
these
products
originally.
while
they
have
and
that
is
certain,
little
test
of
their
own,
they
are
not
tested
adequately
to
meet
these
standards.
now
if
we
can
show
that
the
community
generally
recognizes
this
product
to
be
both
safe
and
effective
then
our
whole
test
is
much
sample
than
that.
now
this
general
reputation
of
proof
is
both
a
terrible
burden
in
the
sense
that
you
got
to
get
qualified
academic
people
who
say
yes,
everybody
knows
this
drug,
it's
good
it
works.
this
is
a
way
it
should
regarded.
if
you
can
get
that
which
is
a
terrific
word
than
the
method
of
proof
is
very
simple.
you
pull
in
your
three
witnesses,
they
testify
for
a
morning
or
so
and
you
do
not
have
to
go
through
all
these
all
these
elaborate
testing
procedures
and
so
forth,
because
the
community
accepts
the
drug.
mr.
george
f.
townes
yes
sir.
mr.
george
f.
townes
well
sir
if
i
were
to
start
advertising
aspirin
for
sale
for
acne
today
and
i
would
be
prosecuted
for
having
new
drug
without
application.
if
i
resisted
it
will
be
tried
in
the
district
court
but
if
i
wanted
to
get
it
approved
i'd
have
to
go
through
the
new
drug
approval.
mr.
george
f.
townes
they
have
the
prosecutorial
authority
to
do
so.
mr.
george
f.
townes
correct.
