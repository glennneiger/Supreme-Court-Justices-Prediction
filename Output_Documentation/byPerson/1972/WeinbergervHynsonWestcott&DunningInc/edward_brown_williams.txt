mr.
edward
brown
williams
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
heard
so
much,
i
don't
know
where
to
begin.
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
the
nas-nrc
reports,
national
research
council
reports
which
evaluated
a
number
of
drugs
for
the
food
and
drug
administration.
the
conclusions
of
those
panels
were
in
many
cases
and
certainly
in
the
case
of
lutrexin
as
the
court
have
appealed
for
the
district
of
columbia
recently
said
in
the
usv
case
conclusory
and
cryptic.
they
certainly
were
that
in
the
case
of
lutrexin.
in
fact,
out
of
the
14
studies,
which
we
eventually
submitted
to
the
food
and
drug
administration,
the
nas-nrc
insofar
as
the
report
show
considered
only
four.
now,
there
has
been
considerable
talk
about
whether
the
issue
here,
is
the
existence
of
adequate
and
well-control
studies.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
no,
may
i
approach
it
this
way.
the
issue
is
not
that
has
been
suggested
and
the
withdrawal
proceeding
under
that
section
which
you
have
cited
whether
there
are
adequate
and
well-controlled
studies
by
their
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
effectiveness
of
the
drug.
the
issue
is,
under
these
regulations
which
are
alleged
by
fda
to
follow
the
summary
judgment
procedure
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedures
whether
under
those
regulations
there
is
a
material,
an
issue
of
material
fact
raised
by
the
evidence
before
the
commission.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
is
our
view
sir
that
under
the
summary
judgment
practice,
in
other
agencies
as
well
as
in
the
court
that
he
must
at
least
put
forth
prima
facie
evidence
to
show
that
he
has
got
a
basis
for
saying
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
do.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
do
and
we
have
already
argued
it
extensively
in
our
briefs.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
don't
see
why
the
necessity
of
showing
that
there
is
no
issue
of
material
fact
before
the
commissioner.
[voice
overlap]
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
must
assume
the
same
rule
under
its
own
regulations
which
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
am
talking
about
the
may
1970
regulation
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
which
have
been
discussed
specifically,
which
defines
substantial
evidence
and
the
right
to
a
hearing.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
that
is
section
130.12
and
.14
of
the
21
cfr
and
it's
at
the
very
back
of
the
appendix
on
page
487
and
following.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
that
is
correct.
but
he
must
have
introduced
some
kind
of
evidence
to
justify
that.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
(inaudible)
lack
of
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
and
if
there
is
a
equivalent
of
ineffective
in
this
context,
in
this
particular
context.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
he
has
always
has
the
burden
and
i
don't
see
that
has
changed
here.
he
wouldn't
have
to
put
on
much
if
we
submitted
a
very
fragile
materials,
obviously.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
might
in
some
cases,
but
in
the
case
of
lutrexin,
may
they
even
consider
the
all
the
materials.
now,
we,
of
course,
must
deny
and
do
so
at
length
in
our
briefs
that
were
not
historical
controls
used
by
dr.
majewski
and
dr.
gratton
in
their
poor
studies.
we
consider
them
an
historical
controls,
our
briefs
have
analyzed
and
attempted
to
show
that
they
are
and
as
far,
they
are
not
having
concomitant
medication
had
necessarily
excluded,
naturally
they
were
but
dr.
gratton,
who
did
use
concomitant
medication,
found
that
with
concomitant
of
medication
without
lutrexin,
he
glossed
far
more
babies
than
with
lutrexin.
therefore,
he
concluded
lutrexin
had
some
effect
because
he
was
using
as
controls
on
patients
whom
he
knew,
were
at
attendance
to
premature
labor,
are
way
in-premature
labor
or
that
will
had
previous
labor,
until
had
previously
had
gone
through
premature
labor.
so
that
we
must
look
at
these
things
directly
and
in
that
connection,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
government's
reply
brief
on
page
29
in
footnotes
33
and
34.
it
says,
reports
by
hemsworth
and
dieckmann
(ph)
has
examples
of
adequate
and
well-controlled
studies
of
a
drug
use
to
treat
cases
of
threatened
and
habitual
abortion.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
29.
these
studies
are
alleged
to
stand
in
stark
contrast
to
the
supposedly
uncontrollable
studies
of
hynson,
westcott
&
dunning.
it
is
significant
to
note
however,
that
the
studies
cited
by
the
government
suffer
from
many
of
the
alleged
defects
that
commissioner
referred
to
in
his
order
withdrawing
approval
of
a
new
drug
application
for
lutrexin.
namely,
in
the
first
place,
in
neither
study,
the
hemsworth
and
dieckmann
study
is
the
use
of
concomitant
medication
rule
out,
that
was
a
complaint
of
the
commissioner
against
the
majewski
and
gratton
studied.
secondly
certain
patients
were
excluded
from
these
studies
which
are
held
by
the
government
without
specific
explanation
again
a
repeat
the
commission’s
complaint
in
the
hynson
matter.
third,
patients
with
medical
complications
were
included
in
this
studies
saying
in
the
dieckmann
paper
there
was
no
method
for
determining
how
many
tablets
of
the
drug
and
investigation
that
patient
took
per
day
or
per
week,
another
complaint
for
commissioner
against
the
hynson
study.
five,
in
a
hemsworth
study
which
was
conducted
by
the
unidentified
staff
of
nine
different
hospitals,
majewski’s
studies
submitted
by
hynson
just
as
in
that
majewski’s
studies
the
historical
incident
of
abortion
and
dieckmann
study
and
premature
deliveries
in
the
hospital
involved
was
compare
with
the
incidence
of
such
complications
among
patients
under
study.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
in
other
words
they
are
doing
to
same
thing
which
would
i
say
is
bad,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
he
selected
physicians
who
had
premature
labor
or
abortion
cases.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
other
physicians,
yes,
just
as
dieckmann
did.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
they
made
a
study
according
to
his
instructions.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
according
to
his
instructions.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
his
study
was,
a
study
of
that
files
on
the
cases
which
he
have
ask
them
to
make
records
on
so
he
could
make
the
study.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
there
were
three
of
them
and
i
am
sorry
i
can’t
remember.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
would
deny
the
hearing.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
would
have
sought
to
show
that
the
historical
controls
used
by
these
people
were
valid
and
if
they
constituted
adequate
and
well-controlled
studies
in
the
sense
of
food
and
drug
regulation.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
the
food
and
drag
hearings
don’t
ordinarily
include
oral
arguments
per
see
but
written
submissions
after
the
evidence
has
been
submitted
but
we
would
of
course
expect
also
to
be
able
to
cross-examine
the
government
witnesses
and
that’s
essential.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
only
the
witnesses
they
put
on.
i
wouldn’t
expect
to
cross-examine
anybody
who
wasn’t
put
on
that
as
witnesses.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
would
not
have
the
subpoena
power
under
present
statute.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
would
like
to
turn
into
it.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
then
of
course
we
had
no
opportunity
to
examine
them
whatsoever.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
my
point
about
a
hearing
you
mean?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
i
think
we
would
be
entitled
to
hearing
in
any
event
and
i
think
i
can
show
that
by
comparison
of
the
505
(e)
(3)
provision,
a
withdrawal
provision,
with
the
provision
of
505
(c)
which
deals
with
an
application
for
a
new
drug
approval
where
it
is
specifically
said,
that
a
hearing
must
proceed
within
a
certain
period,
after
the
request
--
the
offer
is
accepted
unless
there
is
contrary
agreement
by
the
parties.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
conclude
this
one
point
since
so
much
has
made
of
it.
it
is
also
significant
to
note,
in
any
event
the
government
studies
did
not
involve
as
do
hynson's
treatments
of
patients
with
histories
of
prior
pregnancy.
prior
pregnancy
problems
or
patients
in
imminent
danger
of
premature
delivery
or
abortion
all
of
the
majewski
and
gratton
cases
did,
they
can
not
therefore,
that
is
these
two
submitted
by
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
at
the
last
minute
which
we
had
never
seen
by
the
way,
they
can
not
therefore
be
compared
with
hew
in
these
investigations
where
a
high
risk
of
fetal
mortality
existed.
in
such
a
case
the
use
of
a
double-blind,
placebo
type
would
be
unethical
according
to
doctors
ressick
(ph)
gratton,
majewky,
and
allen.
allen
the
later,
allen
being
a
member
of
the
panel
of
the
nas-nrc
which
evaluated
lutrexin.
it
was
his
opinion
stated
on
the
no
rise
letter
to
us
that
lutrexin
should
not
be
taken
off
the
market,
that
they
never
had
such
an
intention.
now
i
should
i
think
it
might
help
if
i
listed
the
issues
which
i
think
were
in
these
two
cases.
in
72-394
which
involves
primarily
the
hearings,
the
questions
are
whether
hynson
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
of
safety
and
efficacy
as
distinguished
from
a
hearing
on
the
jurisdictional
questions
which
i
should
report
to.
secondly
whether
the
new
may
1970
regulations
which
are
in
the
back
part
of
the
appendix
under
which
a
hearing
was
denied
or
valid
as
applied
to
fda
by
fda
to
lutrexin
and
finally
whether
hew
and
hynson’s
right
to
hearing
vested
under
the
former
regulations
which
preceded
these
when
hynson
accepted
the
offer
of
a
hearing
by
a
letter
to
food
and
drug
administration.
in
number
72_414
which
is
in
support
in
which
we
file
the
brief
in
support
of
the
cross
petition,
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
its
conclusion
that
the
commissioner
was
unauthorized
initially
to
determine
his
own
jurisdiction
under
section
201
(p)
the
definition
of
new
drug,
that
is
whether
the
drug
lutrexin
is
generally
recognize
the
safe
and
effective
under
the
act
as
amended
in
1062,
whether
it
was
deemed
to
prove
under
section
107
©
(2)
of
the
act,
if
it
was,
it
is
not
subject
to
administrative
withdrawal
proceedings
under
section
505
(b).
three,
whether
the
drug
was
exempt
from
the
effectiveness
requirements
of
section
107
(c)
(4),
so
called
“grandfather
clause.”
if
so
then
it
is
our
view
that
none
of
the
effectiveness
in
provisions
of
the
statute
are
applicable
to
that
drug.
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
of
the
matter
of
general
recognition
of
safety
and
effectiveness
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
and
i
think
i
do
understand
it,
they
maintain
that
general
recognition
of
safety
and
effectiveness
which
is
the
test
of
new
drug
status
is
dependent
upon
the
existence
of
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
as
defined
in
the
1962
amendments,
in
an
entirely
different
section
of
the
statute,
not
the
covered
section
in
505
(d).
and
that
in
effect,
the
substantial
evidence
definition
is
a
part
of
section
201
(n)
and
there
is
no
real
difference
between
the
determination
of
new
drug
status
and
a
determination
of
whether
the
drug
is
safe
and
effective.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
sorry.
now
it
so
happens
that
201
(n)
wasn't
even
amended
when
this
definition
of
substantial
evidence
was
placed,
written
into
section
505
(d),
a
substantial
evidence
definition.
section
201
(n)
(p),
the
definition
of
new
drug
was
amended
in
1962
only
to
include
the
requirement
of
effectiveness
in
the
definition
of
new
drug,
not
a
requirement
of
substantial
evidence
and
effectiveness.
section
201
(p)
is
a
jurisdictional
test
which
governs
the
application
of
section
505.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
general
recognition
of
safety
and
effectiveness
among
experts
that's
specified
in
the
statute.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
i
will
concede
to
the
government
and
to
anybody
that
evidence
of
clinical
studies
published
in
the
letter
2
is
relevant
on
the
question
of
whether
that
could
be
general
recognition
of
effectiveness
or
of
safety,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
final
test.
some
of
these
drugs
which
have
been
on
the
market
for
years
are
obviously
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective
and
they
may
or
may
not
have
published
studies
upon
which
that
conclusion
was
--
by
which
that
conclusion
was
arrived
at.
it
is
only
after
drug
is
found
to
be
new
in
some,
it
is
only
after
a
drug
is
found
to
be
new
under
section
201
(p)
that
one
looks
at
section
505
to
determine
what
the
obligations
of
its
manufacture
may
be.
i
think
it's
important
that
distinction
be
made.
it
is
always
been
accepted
by
fda
and
the
industry
and
fda
changed
this
view
only
after
--
some
years
after
the
effective
date
of
the
1962
amendment
which
did
not
even
touch
that
section.
now,
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
substantial
evidence;
the
briefs
of
the
government
in
these
cases
place
great,
if
not
primary
emphasis
upon
the
alleged
incapacity
of
fda
to
administer
section
505
as
amended
in
1962.
if
the
anticipated
demands
for
hearings,
that
is
the
hearings
anticipated
by
the
government
and
withdrawal
proceedings
have
to
be
met
by
the
agency.
we
explain,
however,
in
our
brief
in
number
72-394
beginning
at
page
33,
that
only
if
there
is
an
issue
of
material
fact,
need
a
hearing
be
granted
by
the
government
--
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
in
the
case
of
an
application
for
approval
of
the
drug
as
distinguished
from
the
question
of
whether
it's
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective.
in
the
case
of
such
an
application
it
is
expressly
provided
in
the
statute
that
if
the
applicant
accepts
an
opportunity
for
hearing
within
30
days
of
notice
of
such
opportunity,
such
hearing
shall
commence
not
more
than
90
days
after
the
expiration
of
such
30
days
unless
the
secretary
and
the
applicant
otherwise
agree.
that
is
explicit.
i
don't
see
how
an
ex
parte
decision
such
as
was
made
in
this
case
denying
a
hearing
could
be
made
under
such
a
provision.
the
right
to
hearing
in
the
withdrawal
proceeding
must
be
no
less
firm
both
as
i
read
the
statue
and
as
i
read
the
legislative
history.
in
fact
senator
eastland
expressly
stated
in
explaining
this
withdrawal
provision
to
the
senate,
“withdrawal
of
approval
of
a
new
drug
application
would
be
preceded
by
hearing
with
findings
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
that's
rather
explicit.
certainly
in
this
situation
where
as
i
think
we
show
in
our
briefs,
there
likelihood
of
an
overpowering
number
of
required
hearings
seem
in
reality
remote.
the
cases
are
applicable
which
hold
that
inconvenience
or
lack
of
staff
or
lack
of
money
or
the
prospect
of
delay
is
not
good
reason
for
dispensing
with
the
minimal
requirement
of
a
hearing
in
a
adjudicatory
manner
which
isn't.
the
cases
are
recited
in
our
brief
in
number
394
and
they
include
–
the
ohio
bell
telephone
case
and
the
wong
sang
yung
(ph)
case.
that's
at
page
37
and
38.
so
despite
the
express
fears
of
the
government
of
a
multiplicity
in
hearings,
we
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
necessary
showing
of
the
existence
of
a
material
fact
and
that's
all
that
has
been
shown,
would
drastically
curb
even
the
tendency
to
request
such
hearings.
the
government
fear
is
based
on
speculation,
not
on
evidence.
in
any
event
we
believe
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
in
number
394
that
an
issue
of
material
fact
exists
with
respect
to
the
efficacy
of
lutrexin.
we
do
not
deny
that
section
701
(a)
of
the
act
authorizes
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
make
general
rules
for
its
enforcement,
obviously
it
does.
such
regulations
have
the
status
of
law
if
they
are
reasonable
and
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
the
new
drug
regulations
of
may
8,
1972
to
which
we
referred
earlier,
relating
to
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
and
the
right
to
a
hearing
were
issued
under
the
section
701
(a)
to
implement
the
definition
of
new
drug
in
section
201
(p)
and
the
definition
and
section
505
the
operative
new
drug
section.
it
is
those
regulations
with
which
these
cases
are
concerned,
not
the
regulations
published
in
the
federal
register
may
21,
1972.
for
classification
of
over-the-counter
drugs
as
to
the
new
drug
studies,
we
do
not
consider
those
otc
drugs
are
valid
because
they
represent
an
attempt
to
circumvent
the
provisions
of
section
505
of
the
act
by
a
classification
system
and
set
up
by
the
adjudication
procedure
contemplated
by
that
section,
but
they
are
not
before
the
court
today
in
any
event.
in
storer
broadcasting
case
which
was
cited
by
the
government
in
support
of
its
proposition
that
a
rule
can
always
be
substituted
for
adjudication,
did
not
circumvent
the
basic
statutory
provision,
such
as
section
505.
the
relative
is
simple
ownership
rule,
station
ownership
rule
there
involved,
could
be
readily
applied
and
did
not
concern
a
variety
of
different
articles
or
drugs
or
stations
with
different
labeling
and
different
characteristics.
as
this
court
recognized
in
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
chenery,
the
problem
may
be
so
specialized
and
varying
in
nature
as
to
the
impossible
of
capture
within
the
boundaries
of
the
general
rule.
our
basic
position
with
respect
to
the
may
1970
regulations
is
this.
first
as
they
have
been
applied
to
hynson's
drug
lutrexin
there
invalid
because
the
commissioner
refused
to
recognize
that
the
evidence
submitted
by
hynson
raises
a
substantial
issue
of
material
fact
as
to
whether
there
is
substantial
issue,
that
is
a
substantial
evidence
of
a
effectiveness
of
lutrexin
and
failed
to
produce
prima
facie
evidence
to
the
contrary.
under
such
circumstances,
a
hearing
is
required
by
the
statute,
we
submit,
before
the
commissioner
may
legally
withdraw
approval
of
the
drug
under
section
503
(e)
three
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
substantial
evidence.
under
the
summary
judgment
rule
of
the
r.c.p
as
i
have
said,
upon
which
these
fda
rules
are
allegedly
patterned,
it
is
clearly
the
burden
of
the
proponent
to
show
by
prima
facie
evidence,
if
there
is
no
issue
material
fact
presented
by
such
evidence.
moreover,
under
that
rile
the
opposing
party
is
entitled
to
depose
or
examine
the
witnesses
of
the
other
party.
it
is
clear
that
aside
from
the
burden
of
proof
rules
in
the
summary
judgment
procedures,
the
administrative
procedure
act
requires
that
fda
as
a
proponent
of
the
order
shoulder
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
and
this
it
did
not
do,
also
this
is
clear
from
the
language
of
section
505.
the
second
basic
objection
to
the
may
1970
regulation
because
if
they
combine
and
a
commissioner
both
the
prosecutorial
function
and
the
judging
function.
we
recognize
that
the
commissioner
must
make
the
eventual
and
final
decision
as
to
whether
the
drug
should
be
withdrawn,
but
it
is
unfair,
we
think
to
provide
for
an
ex
parte
decision
by
the
commissioner
without
the
submission
by
him
of
any
evidence
whatsoever
to
rebut
the
studies
and
affidavits
of
the
distinguished
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
which
instant
(inaudible)
presented.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
i
go
on
to
point
out
and
i
can
do
it
more
briefly
that
--
well,
i
did
say,
if
you
recalling,
that
we
recognize
that
the
commissioner
must
make
the
final
decision,
but
as
the
attorney
general's
committee
said
in
1941,
“one
way
to
eliminate
the
possibility
of
unfairness
in
summary
judgment
proceedings
or
any
other
proceedings
for
that
matter
is
to
have
an
impartial
judge
to
original
judgment.”
and
if
that
is
the
burden,
the
cases,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
customarily,
food
and
drug,
new
drug
hearings
have
been
held
before
an
examiner
who
is
now
called
an
administrative
judge
and
that's
way
it
should
be
in
this
case
according
our
view.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes,
we
have
a
specific
provision.
well,
i
just
went
into
the
hearing
question,
it
seem
perfectly
clear
for
–
oh!
you
mean
about
an
administrative
judge?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
oh!
well,
i
think
that
we
cited
goldberg
versus
kelly
one
of
this
court's
cases
and
icc
versus
louisville
&
nashville
railroad
company
in
our
brief
at
page
32
in
support
of
that
position.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
but
how
can
you
have
a
fair
hearing
if
you
don't
have
at
all.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
oh!
that's
all,
i
really
don't
contend
any
more
than
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
contend
anymore
than
that.
but
i
might
point
out
that
this
court
said
through
justice
brennan
in
almost
every
setting
where
important
decisions
turn
on
to
question
of
fact,
due
process
requires
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
witnesses
and
that
we
didn't
get
yet.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
heard
so
much,
i
don't
know
where
to
begin.
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
the
nas-nrc
reports,
national
research
council
reports
which
evaluated
a
number
of
drugs
for
the
food
and
drug
administration.
the
conclusions
of
those
panels
were
in
many
cases
and
certainly
in
the
case
of
lutrexin
as
the
court
have
appealed
for
the
district
of
columbia
recently
said
in
the
usv
case
conclusory
and
cryptic.
they
certainly
were
that
in
the
case
of
lutrexin.
in
fact,
out
of
the
14
studies,
which
we
eventually
submitted
to
the
food
and
drug
administration,
the
nas-nrc
insofar
as
the
report
show
considered
only
four.
now,
there
has
been
considerable
talk
about
whether
the
issue
here,
is
the
existence
of
adequate
and
well-control
studies.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
no,
may
i
approach
it
this
way.
the
issue
is
not
that
has
been
suggested
and
the
withdrawal
proceeding
under
that
section
which
you
have
cited
whether
there
are
adequate
and
well-controlled
studies
by
their
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
effectiveness
of
the
drug.
the
issue
is,
under
these
regulations
which
are
alleged
by
fda
to
follow
the
summary
judgment
procedure
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedures
whether
under
those
regulations
there
is
a
material,
an
issue
of
material
fact
raised
by
the
evidence
before
the
commission.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
is
our
view
sir
that
under
the
summary
judgment
practice,
in
other
agencies
as
well
as
in
the
court
that
he
must
at
least
put
forth
prima
facie
evidence
to
show
that
he
has
got
a
basis
for
saying
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
do.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
do
and
we
have
already
argued
it
extensively
in
our
briefs.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
don't
see
why
the
necessity
of
showing
that
there
is
no
issue
of
material
fact
before
the
commissioner.
[voice
overlap]
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
must
assume
the
same
rule
under
its
own
regulations
which
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
i
am
talking
about
the
may
1970
regulation
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
--
which
have
been
discussed
specifically,
which
defines
substantial
evidence
and
the
right
to
a
hearing.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
that
is
section
130.12
and
.14
of
the
21
cfr
and
it's
at
the
very
back
of
the
appendix
on
page
487
and
following.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
that
is
correct.
but
he
must
have
introduced
some
kind
of
evidence
to
justify
that.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
(inaudible)
lack
of
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
and
if
there
is
a
equivalent
of
ineffective
in
this
context,
in
this
particular
context.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
he
has
always
has
the
burden
and
i
don't
see
that
has
changed
here.
he
wouldn't
have
to
put
on
much
if
we
submitted
a
very
fragile
materials,
obviously.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
it
might
in
some
cases,
but
in
the
case
of
lutrexin,
may
they
even
consider
the
all
the
materials.
now,
we,
of
course,
must
deny
and
do
so
at
length
in
our
briefs
that
were
not
historical
controls
used
by
dr.
majewski
and
dr.
gratton
in
their
poor
studies.
we
consider
them
an
historical
controls,
our
briefs
have
analyzed
and
attempted
to
show
that
they
are
and
as
far,
they
are
not
having
concomitant
medication
had
necessarily
excluded,
naturally
they
were
but
dr.
gratton,
who
did
use
concomitant
medication,
found
that
with
concomitant
of
medication
without
lutrexin,
he
glossed
far
more
babies
than
with
lutrexin.
therefore,
he
concluded
lutrexin
had
some
effect
because
he
was
using
as
controls
on
patients
whom
he
knew,
were
at
attendance
to
premature
labor,
are
way
in-premature
labor
or
that
will
had
previous
labor,
until
had
previously
had
gone
through
premature
labor.
so
that
we
must
look
at
these
things
directly
and
in
that
connection,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
government's
reply
brief
on
page
29
in
footnotes
33
and
34.
it
says,
reports
by
hemsworth
and
dieckmann
(ph)
has
examples
of
adequate
and
well-controlled
studies
of
a
drug
use
to
treat
cases
of
threatened
and
habitual
abortion.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
29.
these
studies
are
alleged
to
stand
in
stark
contrast
to
the
supposedly
uncontrollable
studies
of
hynson,
westcott
&
dunning.
it
is
significant
to
note
however,
that
the
studies
cited
by
the
government
suffer
from
many
of
the
alleged
defects
that
commissioner
referred
to
in
his
order
withdrawing
approval
of
a
new
drug
application
for
lutrexin.
namely,
in
the
first
place,
in
neither
study,
the
hemsworth
and
dieckmann
study
is
the
use
of
concomitant
medication
rule
out,
that
was
a
complaint
of
the
commissioner
against
the
majewski
and
gratton
studied.
secondly
certain
patients
were
excluded
from
these
studies
which
are
held
by
the
government
without
specific
explanation
again
a
repeat
the
commission’s
complaint
in
the
hynson
matter.
third,
patients
with
medical
complications
were
included
in
this
studies
saying
in
the
dieckmann
paper
there
was
no
method
for
determining
how
many
tablets
of
the
drug
and
investigation
that
patient
took
per
day
or
per
week,
another
complaint
for
commissioner
against
the
hynson
study.
five,
in
a
hemsworth
study
which
was
conducted
by
the
unidentified
staff
of
nine
different
hospitals,
majewski’s
studies
submitted
by
hynson
just
as
in
that
majewski’s
studies
the
historical
incident
of
abortion
and
dieckmann
study
and
premature
deliveries
in
the
hospital
involved
was
compare
with
the
incidence
of
such
complications
among
patients
under
study.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
in
other
words
they
are
doing
to
same
thing
which
would
i
say
is
bad,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
sir.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
he
selected
physicians
who
had
premature
labor
or
abortion
cases.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
other
physicians,
yes,
just
as
dieckmann
did.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
they
made
a
study
according
to
his
instructions.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
according
to
his
instructions.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no,
his
study
was,
a
study
of
that
files
on
the
cases
which
he
have
ask
them
to
make
records
on
so
he
could
make
the
study.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
there
were
three
of
them
and
i
am
sorry
i
can’t
remember.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
would
deny
the
hearing.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
would
have
sought
to
show
that
the
historical
controls
used
by
these
people
were
valid
and
if
they
constituted
adequate
and
well-controlled
studies
in
the
sense
of
food
and
drug
regulation.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
the
food
and
drag
hearings
don’t
ordinarily
include
oral
arguments
per
see
but
written
submissions
after
the
evidence
has
been
submitted
but
we
would
of
course
expect
also
to
be
able
to
cross-examine
the
government
witnesses
and
that’s
essential.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
only
the
witnesses
they
put
on.
i
wouldn’t
expect
to
cross-examine
anybody
who
wasn’t
put
on
that
as
witnesses.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
would
not
have
the
subpoena
power
under
present
statute.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
we
would
like
to
turn
into
it.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes
then
of
course
we
had
no
opportunity
to
examine
them
whatsoever.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
my
point
about
a
hearing
you
mean?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
i
think
we
would
be
entitled
to
hearing
in
any
event
and
i
think
i
can
show
that
by
comparison
of
the
505
(e)
(3)
provision,
a
withdrawal
provision,
with
the
provision
of
505
(c)
which
deals
with
an
application
for
a
new
drug
approval
where
it
is
specifically
said,
that
a
hearing
must
proceed
within
a
certain
period,
after
the
request
--
the
offer
is
accepted
unless
there
is
contrary
agreement
by
the
parties.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
conclude
this
one
point
since
so
much
has
made
of
it.
it
is
also
significant
to
note,
in
any
event
the
government
studies
did
not
involve
as
do
hynson's
treatments
of
patients
with
histories
of
prior
pregnancy.
prior
pregnancy
problems
or
patients
in
imminent
danger
of
premature
delivery
or
abortion
all
of
the
majewski
and
gratton
cases
did,
they
can
not
therefore,
that
is
these
two
submitted
by
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
at
the
last
minute
which
we
had
never
seen
by
the
way,
they
can
not
therefore
be
compared
with
hew
in
these
investigations
where
a
high
risk
of
fetal
mortality
existed.
in
such
a
case
the
use
of
a
double-blind,
placebo
type
would
be
unethical
according
to
doctors
ressick
(ph)
gratton,
majewky,
and
allen.
allen
the
later,
allen
being
a
member
of
the
panel
of
the
nas-nrc
which
evaluated
lutrexin.
it
was
his
opinion
stated
on
the
no
rise
letter
to
us
that
lutrexin
should
not
be
taken
off
the
market,
that
they
never
had
such
an
intention.
now
i
should
i
think
it
might
help
if
i
listed
the
issues
which
i
think
were
in
these
two
cases.
in
72-394
which
involves
primarily
the
hearings,
the
questions
are
whether
hynson
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
of
safety
and
efficacy
as
distinguished
from
a
hearing
on
the
jurisdictional
questions
which
i
should
report
to.
secondly
whether
the
new
may
1970
regulations
which
are
in
the
back
part
of
the
appendix
under
which
a
hearing
was
denied
or
valid
as
applied
to
fda
by
fda
to
lutrexin
and
finally
whether
hew
and
hynson’s
right
to
hearing
vested
under
the
former
regulations
which
preceded
these
when
hynson
accepted
the
offer
of
a
hearing
by
a
letter
to
food
and
drug
administration.
in
number
72_414
which
is
in
support
in
which
we
file
the
brief
in
support
of
the
cross
petition,
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
its
conclusion
that
the
commissioner
was
unauthorized
initially
to
determine
his
own
jurisdiction
under
section
201
(p)
the
definition
of
new
drug,
that
is
whether
the
drug
lutrexin
is
generally
recognize
the
safe
and
effective
under
the
act
as
amended
in
1062,
whether
it
was
deemed
to
prove
under
section
107
©
(2)
of
the
act,
if
it
was,
it
is
not
subject
to
administrative
withdrawal
proceedings
under
section
505
(b).
three,
whether
the
drug
was
exempt
from
the
effectiveness
requirements
of
section
107
(c)
(4),
so
called
“grandfather
clause.”
if
so
then
it
is
our
view
that
none
of
the
effectiveness
in
provisions
of
the
statute
are
applicable
to
that
drug.
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
of
the
matter
of
general
recognition
of
safety
and
effectiveness
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
and
i
think
i
do
understand
it,
they
maintain
that
general
recognition
of
safety
and
effectiveness
which
is
the
test
of
new
drug
status
is
dependent
upon
the
existence
of
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
as
defined
in
the
1962
amendments,
in
an
entirely
different
section
of
the
statute,
not
the
covered
section
in
505
(d).
and
that
in
effect,
the
substantial
evidence
definition
is
a
part
of
section
201
(n)
and
there
is
no
real
difference
between
the
determination
of
new
drug
status
and
a
determination
of
whether
the
drug
is
safe
and
effective.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
sorry.
now
it
so
happens
that
201
(n)
wasn't
even
amended
when
this
definition
of
substantial
evidence
was
placed,
written
into
section
505
(d),
a
substantial
evidence
definition.
section
201
(n)
(p),
the
definition
of
new
drug
was
amended
in
1962
only
to
include
the
requirement
of
effectiveness
in
the
definition
of
new
drug,
not
a
requirement
of
substantial
evidence
and
effectiveness.
section
201
(p)
is
a
jurisdictional
test
which
governs
the
application
of
section
505.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
general
recognition
of
safety
and
effectiveness
among
experts
that's
specified
in
the
statute.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
no
i
will
concede
to
the
government
and
to
anybody
that
evidence
of
clinical
studies
published
in
the
letter
2
is
relevant
on
the
question
of
whether
that
could
be
general
recognition
of
effectiveness
or
of
safety,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
final
test.
some
of
these
drugs
which
have
been
on
the
market
for
years
are
obviously
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective
and
they
may
or
may
not
have
published
studies
upon
which
that
conclusion
was
--
by
which
that
conclusion
was
arrived
at.
it
is
only
after
drug
is
found
to
be
new
in
some,
it
is
only
after
a
drug
is
found
to
be
new
under
section
201
(p)
that
one
looks
at
section
505
to
determine
what
the
obligations
of
its
manufacture
may
be.
i
think
it's
important
that
distinction
be
made.
it
is
always
been
accepted
by
fda
and
the
industry
and
fda
changed
this
view
only
after
--
some
years
after
the
effective
date
of
the
1962
amendment
which
did
not
even
touch
that
section.
now,
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
substantial
evidence;
the
briefs
of
the
government
in
these
cases
place
great,
if
not
primary
emphasis
upon
the
alleged
incapacity
of
fda
to
administer
section
505
as
amended
in
1962.
if
the
anticipated
demands
for
hearings,
that
is
the
hearings
anticipated
by
the
government
and
withdrawal
proceedings
have
to
be
met
by
the
agency.
we
explain,
however,
in
our
brief
in
number
72-394
beginning
at
page
33,
that
only
if
there
is
an
issue
of
material
fact,
need
a
hearing
be
granted
by
the
government
--
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
in
the
case
of
an
application
for
approval
of
the
drug
as
distinguished
from
the
question
of
whether
it's
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective.
in
the
case
of
such
an
application
it
is
expressly
provided
in
the
statute
that
if
the
applicant
accepts
an
opportunity
for
hearing
within
30
days
of
notice
of
such
opportunity,
such
hearing
shall
commence
not
more
than
90
days
after
the
expiration
of
such
30
days
unless
the
secretary
and
the
applicant
otherwise
agree.
that
is
explicit.
i
don't
see
how
an
ex
parte
decision
such
as
was
made
in
this
case
denying
a
hearing
could
be
made
under
such
a
provision.
the
right
to
hearing
in
the
withdrawal
proceeding
must
be
no
less
firm
both
as
i
read
the
statue
and
as
i
read
the
legislative
history.
in
fact
senator
eastland
expressly
stated
in
explaining
this
withdrawal
provision
to
the
senate,
“withdrawal
of
approval
of
a
new
drug
application
would
be
preceded
by
hearing
with
findings
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
that's
rather
explicit.
certainly
in
this
situation
where
as
i
think
we
show
in
our
briefs,
there
likelihood
of
an
overpowering
number
of
required
hearings
seem
in
reality
remote.
the
cases
are
applicable
which
hold
that
inconvenience
or
lack
of
staff
or
lack
of
money
or
the
prospect
of
delay
is
not
good
reason
for
dispensing
with
the
minimal
requirement
of
a
hearing
in
a
adjudicatory
manner
which
isn't.
the
cases
are
recited
in
our
brief
in
number
394
and
they
include
–
the
ohio
bell
telephone
case
and
the
wong
sang
yung
(ph)
case.
that's
at
page
37
and
38.
so
despite
the
express
fears
of
the
government
of
a
multiplicity
in
hearings,
we
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
necessary
showing
of
the
existence
of
a
material
fact
and
that's
all
that
has
been
shown,
would
drastically
curb
even
the
tendency
to
request
such
hearings.
the
government
fear
is
based
on
speculation,
not
on
evidence.
in
any
event
we
believe
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
in
number
394
that
an
issue
of
material
fact
exists
with
respect
to
the
efficacy
of
lutrexin.
we
do
not
deny
that
section
701
(a)
of
the
act
authorizes
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
make
general
rules
for
its
enforcement,
obviously
it
does.
such
regulations
have
the
status
of
law
if
they
are
reasonable
and
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
the
new
drug
regulations
of
may
8,
1972
to
which
we
referred
earlier,
relating
to
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
and
the
right
to
a
hearing
were
issued
under
the
section
701
(a)
to
implement
the
definition
of
new
drug
in
section
201
(p)
and
the
definition
and
section
505
the
operative
new
drug
section.
it
is
those
regulations
with
which
these
cases
are
concerned,
not
the
regulations
published
in
the
federal
register
may
21,
1972.
for
classification
of
over-the-counter
drugs
as
to
the
new
drug
studies,
we
do
not
consider
those
otc
drugs
are
valid
because
they
represent
an
attempt
to
circumvent
the
provisions
of
section
505
of
the
act
by
a
classification
system
and
set
up
by
the
adjudication
procedure
contemplated
by
that
section,
but
they
are
not
before
the
court
today
in
any
event.
in
storer
broadcasting
case
which
was
cited
by
the
government
in
support
of
its
proposition
that
a
rule
can
always
be
substituted
for
adjudication,
did
not
circumvent
the
basic
statutory
provision,
such
as
section
505.
the
relative
is
simple
ownership
rule,
station
ownership
rule
there
involved,
could
be
readily
applied
and
did
not
concern
a
variety
of
different
articles
or
drugs
or
stations
with
different
labeling
and
different
characteristics.
as
this
court
recognized
in
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
chenery,
the
problem
may
be
so
specialized
and
varying
in
nature
as
to
the
impossible
of
capture
within
the
boundaries
of
the
general
rule.
our
basic
position
with
respect
to
the
may
1970
regulations
is
this.
first
as
they
have
been
applied
to
hynson's
drug
lutrexin
there
invalid
because
the
commissioner
refused
to
recognize
that
the
evidence
submitted
by
hynson
raises
a
substantial
issue
of
material
fact
as
to
whether
there
is
substantial
issue,
that
is
a
substantial
evidence
of
a
effectiveness
of
lutrexin
and
failed
to
produce
prima
facie
evidence
to
the
contrary.
under
such
circumstances,
a
hearing
is
required
by
the
statute,
we
submit,
before
the
commissioner
may
legally
withdraw
approval
of
the
drug
under
section
503
(e)
three
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
substantial
evidence.
under
the
summary
judgment
rule
of
the
r.c.p
as
i
have
said,
upon
which
these
fda
rules
are
allegedly
patterned,
it
is
clearly
the
burden
of
the
proponent
to
show
by
prima
facie
evidence,
if
there
is
no
issue
material
fact
presented
by
such
evidence.
moreover,
under
that
rile
the
opposing
party
is
entitled
to
depose
or
examine
the
witnesses
of
the
other
party.
it
is
clear
that
aside
from
the
burden
of
proof
rules
in
the
summary
judgment
procedures,
the
administrative
procedure
act
requires
that
fda
as
a
proponent
of
the
order
shoulder
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
and
this
it
did
not
do,
also
this
is
clear
from
the
language
of
section
505.
the
second
basic
objection
to
the
may
1970
regulation
because
if
they
combine
and
a
commissioner
both
the
prosecutorial
function
and
the
judging
function.
we
recognize
that
the
commissioner
must
make
the
eventual
and
final
decision
as
to
whether
the
drug
should
be
withdrawn,
but
it
is
unfair,
we
think
to
provide
for
an
ex
parte
decision
by
the
commissioner
without
the
submission
by
him
of
any
evidence
whatsoever
to
rebut
the
studies
and
affidavits
of
the
distinguished
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
which
instant
(inaudible)
presented.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
well,
i
go
on
to
point
out
and
i
can
do
it
more
briefly
that
--
well,
i
did
say,
if
you
recalling,
that
we
recognize
that
the
commissioner
must
make
the
final
decision,
but
as
the
attorney
general's
committee
said
in
1941,
“one
way
to
eliminate
the
possibility
of
unfairness
in
summary
judgment
proceedings
or
any
other
proceedings
for
that
matter
is
to
have
an
impartial
judge
to
original
judgment.”
and
if
that
is
the
burden,
the
cases,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
customarily,
food
and
drug,
new
drug
hearings
have
been
held
before
an
examiner
who
is
now
called
an
administrative
judge
and
that's
way
it
should
be
in
this
case
according
our
view.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
yes,
we
have
a
specific
provision.
well,
i
just
went
into
the
hearing
question,
it
seem
perfectly
clear
for
–
oh!
you
mean
about
an
administrative
judge?
mr.
edward
brown
williams
oh!
well,
i
think
that
we
cited
goldberg
versus
kelly
one
of
this
court's
cases
and
icc
versus
louisville
&
nashville
railroad
company
in
our
brief
at
page
32
in
support
of
that
position.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
but
how
can
you
have
a
fair
hearing
if
you
don't
have
at
all.
mr.
edward
brown
williams
oh!
that's
all,
i
really
don't
contend
any
more
than
--
mr.
edward
brown
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
contend
anymore
than
that.
but
i
might
point
out
that
this
court
said
through
justice
brennan
in
almost
every
setting
where
important
decisions
turn
on
to
question
of
fact,
due
process
requires
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
witnesses
and
that
we
didn't
get
yet.
thank
you.
