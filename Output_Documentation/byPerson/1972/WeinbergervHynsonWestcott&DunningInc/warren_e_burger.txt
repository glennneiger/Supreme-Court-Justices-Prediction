chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
this
morning
in
a
series
of
related
cases
which
i'll
indicate
only
by
number,
72-395,
72-414,
72-528,
555
and
666.
mr.
freedman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
freedman,
before
you
go
into
that,
prior
to
the
1962
amendment,
if
you
will
tell
me
again,
what
was
the
mechanism,
the
enforcement
mechanism,
was
it
only
a
cease-and-desist
order
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
or
injunction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
imply
that
to
common
aspirin,
to
illustrate
how
it
relates
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
long
predates,
1938.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
that
would
be
to
fix
a
definition
basically,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn't
it
have
prongs;
one
would
affect
the
particular
parties
involved
now,
and
the
other
would
be
to
establish
a
definition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
still
speaking
of
the
fourth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
that
be
a
de
novo
proceeding
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
freedman.
mr.
szuch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
agree
that
the
district
court
would
have
the
de
nova
proceeding
to
resolve
these
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
other
regulatory
scheme
mr.
schuck
that
functions
on
that
kind
of
the
structure
that
you
can
suggest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that,
do
you
think
that
squares
with
the
1962,
the
purposes
underlying
in
1962
amendments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
seen
various
figures
some
of
them
in
here
and
some
elsewhere
about
the
number
of
--
the
estimated
number
of
drugs
on
the
market
today
as
compared
with
13
or
14
years
ago
and
it's
an
enormous
multiplier,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
something
of
a
self
regulatory
system
in
a
fact
than
you
are
suggesting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
you
said
testify,
you
mean
testify
in
a
traditional
sense
or
do
they
testimonial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
just
want
to
be
sure,
which
sort
of
those
two
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
townes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
proceeding
affect
just
the
particular
drug
involved
and
a
particular
party
before
the
court
or
would
it
effect
all
the
so
called
'me-too'
or
piggy
back
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
typical
forfeiture
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
like
a
lot
of
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
could
identify
all
the
people
who
had
comparable
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
proceeding
that
you
are
talking
about
is
one
and
which
you
test
out
the
issue
on
the
general
reputation
as
distinguished
from
clinical
testing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
which
–
and
that's
--
i
am
trying
to
sort
these
two
out.
you
said
you
are
bring
in
people
who
have
used
the
two,
who
heard
about
it,
who
read
about
it.
this
is
what
might
be
called
the
general
reputation
in
the
scientific
medical
community
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
relating
to
this
material.
now
is
that
something
that's
different
from
the
controlled
clinical
laboratory
testing
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
don't
think
that
second,
the
controlled
clinical
or
laboratory
approach
is
involved
in
this
district
court
approach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
townes,
let
me
go
back
to
that
illustration
which
you
both
accepted
about
aspirin
being
a
cure
for
acne
and
this
is
a
new
claim
that's
made.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
is
it
your
position
that
this
can
be
tested
out
only
in
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
fda
cannot,
to
use
the
term
used
here,
how
the
threshold
authority
to
say,
no
you
can't.
that
claim
is
patently
invalid
and
you
can't
market
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
takes
them
into
the
district
court
rather?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
it's
something
like
a
prima
facie
showing
in
conventional
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
soon
as
the
fda
disagrees
with
an
applicant
then
the
applicant
views
him
as
an
adversary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
some
parallel
levels
here
mr.
frey
possibly
between
this
situation
and
section
2255
where
a
district
judge
may
dispense
where
the
hearing
if
he
finds
that
it
conclusively
appears
on
the
face
of
the
record
if
there
is
nothing
to
have
hearing
about.
is
it
something
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
way
you
have
described
that
the
drug
companies
have
sometimes
at
least
filed
some
papers
and
some
opinions
and
some
records
about
the
merits
of
this
drug?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
are
saying
that
the
secretary,
the
fda
can
say
there
is
nothing
here
on
the
face
of
what
you
have
submitted
that
requires
us
to
have
any
hearing
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
that
point
after
lunch.
[lunch]
before
you
go
on
mr.
frey,
it
may
seem
to
you
that
we
have
been
asking
you
a
lot
of
questions
here
and
taking
up
some
of
the
time
of
the
counsel.
we'll
compensate
for
that,
we
will
enlarge
the
time
each
side
for
10
minutes,
and
you
gentlemen
will
look
up
the
allocation
of
that
bonus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
use
the
same.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
regard
this
clinical
testing
as
a
precondition
to
going
on
in
the
market?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
mr.
williams
on
next?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
little
bit
in
conflict,
isn't
it,
with
the
idea
that
congress
has
very
broad
power
to
setup
hurdles
to
any
drug
getting
on
the
market,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understood
your
response
correctly,
mr.
williams,
it
was
that
you
have
a
drug
on
the
market
and
this
question
arises
and
you
say
that
you
need
to
bear
no
burden
at
all
in
response
to
this
question,
this
issue
being
raised
and
if
you
default
in
traditional
terms,
the
fda
must
assume
the
role
that
a
plaintiff
assumes
in
a
default
case
include
nothing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
specific
regulation
do
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
–
where
do
we
find
them
[voice
overlap]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that,
at
what
page?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
keep
your
voice
up
a
little
bit
mr.
williams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
the
standard
is
standard
of
proof
on
the
effectiveness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
that
you
mean
the
--
what
is
called
the
anecdotal,
but
the
testimony
--
testimonials
of
people
who
used
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
goldberg
versus
kelly
didn't
provide
for
a
hearing
examiner.
it
was
a
person
right
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
talking
now
about
what
your
authority
is
goldberg
against
kelly
that
you
rely
on
did
not
call
for
an
independent
hearing
examiner
in
the
sense
that
you
are
arguing,
but
merely
a
different
person
within
the
social
security
hierarchy
from
the
man
who
had
made
the
original
decision,
that's
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
spite
of
more
than
the
hearing
examiner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
williams,
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
speak
of
this
informed
and
expert
opinion,
this
is
that
category
that
is
generally
the
general
reputation
of
the
drug
as
distinguished
from
evidence
coming
from
controlled
tests,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
it
isn't
a
question
whether
he
can
come
to
a
conclusion,
it’s
whether
he
can
come
to
a
correct
conclusion,
isn't
that
the
--
what
this
1962
act
is
all
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
had
no
effectiveness
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
they
--
if
the
fda
concluded
that
they
were
totally
ineffective,
how
in
your
view,
do
they
address
themselves
to
that
problem
in
the
public
interest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
exemption
is
a
derivative
exemption
on
the
'me-too'
product,
isn't
it?
it
derives
from
the
past
drug,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
because
they
got
a
free
ride
of
piggyback?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
1962?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
on
page
482?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
burden
of
proof
there
of
course
would
be
the
conventional
criminal
burden
of
proof,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what's
the
burden
of
proof
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
frey.
you
have
few
minutes
left,
i
think,
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think,
it's
about
7
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hoffman,
the
essence
of
your
position,
if
i
understand
it
is
that
this
regulatory
scheme
depends
largely
if
not
entirely
on
criminal
sanctions
in
the
district
court,
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
is
there
any
other
regulatory
scheme
of
this
general
character,
in
which
that
burden
is
placed
on
the
regulatory
agency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice

of

i'll

have
any
hearing
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
that
point
after
lunch.
[lunch]
before
you
go
on
mr.
frey,
it
may
seem
to
you
that
we
have
been
asking
you
a
lot
of
questions
here
and
taking
up
some
of
the
time
of
the
counsel.
we'll
compensate
for
that,
we
will
enlarge
the
time
each
side
for
10
minutes,
and
you
gentlemen
will
look
up
the
allocation
of
that
bonus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
use
the
same.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
regard
this
clinical
testing
as
a
precondition
to
going
on
in
the
market?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
mr.
williams
on
next?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
little
bit
in
conflict,
isn't
it,
with
the
idea
that
congress
has
very
broad
power
to
setup
hurdles
to
any
drug
getting
on
the
market,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understood
your
response
correctly,
mr.
williams,
it
was
that
you
have
a
drug
on
the
market
and
this
question
arises
and
you
say
that
you
need
to
bear
no
burden
at
all
in
response
to
this
question,
this
issue
being
raised
and
if
you
default
in
traditional
terms,
the
fda
must
assume
the
role
that
a
plaintiff
assumes
in
a
default
case
include
nothing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
specific
regulation
do
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
–
where
do
we
find
them
[voice
overlap]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that,
at
what
page?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
keep
your
voice
up
a
little
bit
mr.
williams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
the
standard
is
standard
of
proof
on
the
effectiveness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
that
you
mean
the
--
what
is
called
the
anecdotal,
but
the
testimony
--
testimonials
of
people
who
used
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
goldberg
versus
kelly
didn't
provide
for
a
hearing
examiner.
it
was
a
person
right
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
talking
now
about
what
your
authority
is
goldberg
against
kelly
that
you
rely
on
did
not
call
for
an
independent
hearing
examiner
in
the
sense
that
you
are
arguing,
but
merely
a
different
person
within
the
social
security
hierarchy
from
the
man
who
had
made
the
original
decision,
that's
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
spite
of
more
than
the
hearing
examiner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
williams,
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
speak
of
this
informed
and
expert
opinion,
this
is
that
category
that
is
generally
the
general
reputation
of
the
drug
as
distinguished
from
evidence
coming
from
controlled
tests,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
it
isn't
a
question
whether
he
can
come
to
a
conclusion,
it’s
whether
he
can
come
to
a
correct
conclusion,
isn't
that
the
--
what
this
1962
act
is
all
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
had
no
effectiveness
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
they
--
if
the
fda
concluded
that
they
were
totally
ineffective,
how
in
your
view,
do
they
address
themselves
to
that
problem
in
the
public
interest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
exemption
is
a
derivative
exemption
on
the
'me-too'
product,
isn't
it?
it
derives
from
the
past
drug,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
because
they
got
a
free
ride
of
piggyback?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
1962?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
on
page
482?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
burden
of
proof
there
of
course
would
be
the
conventional
criminal
burden
of
proof,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what's
the
burden
of
proof
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
frey.
you
have
few
minutes
left,
i
think,
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think,
it's
about
7
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hoffman,
the
essence
of
your
position,
if
i
understand
it
is
that
this
regulatory
scheme
depends
largely
if
not
entirely
on
criminal
sanctions
in
the
district
court,
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
is
there
any
other
regulatory
scheme
of
this
general
character,
in
which
that
burden
is
placed
on
the
regulatory
agency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
