mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fifth
and
final
case
in
these
consolidated
proceedings
is
usv
pharmaceutical
corporation
against
wienberger.
this
case
is
here
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
like
ciba
and
bentex,
it
arose
as
a
civil
action
in
the
district
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
the
products
involved
are
not
new
drugs
as
define
by
the
act.
the
issues
in
the
usv
case
involve
solely
the
interpretation
of
the
grandfather
clause
in
the
1962
amendments,
section
107
(c)
(4).
the
district
court
held
that
the
products
involved
do
enjoy
grandfather
status
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
do
not.
now
before
proceeding
to
the
specifics
of
this
case
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
step
back
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
overall
statutory
scheme
which
we
have
been
discussing,
since
10
o'
clock
this
morning.
there
has
been
some
imprecise
use
of
terms
during
the
course
of
the
arguments
and
with
the
court
permission
i
should
like
to
briefly
restate
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
with
which
we
are
confronted.
there
are
only
two
relevant
terms
used
in
the
statute
of
all
those
shorthand
expressions
that
have
been
brought
up
today.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
the
term
“old
drug”
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
there
are
only
two
terms,
the
terms
are
“drug”
and
“new
drug”
both
of
these
are
specifically
defined
in
the
act.
and
for
present
purposes
we
need
not
get
into
the
details
of
the
definition
of
the
drug
generally.
we
can
just
assume
that
this
refers
to
what
we
normally
think
of
as
drugs,
but
the
term
“new
drug”
in
explicitly
defined.
a
special
class
of
drugs
is
carved
out
is
define
by
section
201
(p)
of
the
act
and
this
is
been
so
since
1938,
so
that
the
act
regulates
all
drugs.
it
regulated
drugs
generally
in
a
certain
manner
and
it
regulates
new
drugs
in
a
very
specific
manner.
this
scheme
is
described
in
the
brief
for
the
proprietary
association
which
is
the
thick
light
green
brief
at
pages
4-9
and
also
in
the
pma
brief
which
is
this
thick
dark
green
brief
at
pages
28-29
and
rather
than
repeat
what
it
said
there
let
me
simply
summarize.
in
1938,
the
basic
food
and
drug
act,
pure
food
and
drug
act
in
1906
was
totally
revamped
to
strengthen
the
authority
of
food
and
drug
administration
to
protect
the
public
in
the
field
of
drugs,
this
obviously
is
true.
but
the
powers
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
strengthened
very
largely
by
way
of
increasing
their
authority
as
an
enforcement
agency,
a
prosecutor
if
you
will,
in
the
district
courts.
the
basic
statutory
scheme
which
applies
to
the
regulation
of
drugs
contemplates
that
the
substantive
probations
of
the
act
will
enforced
in
civil
or
criminal
actions
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
on
the
reference
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
the
district
courts,
so
that
if
the
drug
is
misbranded
the
remedy
available
to
the
government
is
a
civil
action
to
seize
the
product
or
for
an
injunction
or
a
criminal
prosecution.
if
a
drug
is
adulterated,
the
same
remedies
are
available,
a
civil
action
procedure
or
for
an
injunction
or
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
no
direct
authority
with
an
exception
that
i
will
refer
to
in
a
few
moments,
to
directly
enforce
these
prohibitions.
as
was
pointed
out
in
response
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
agency
has
no
seize
and
desist
order
--
authority.
this
is
not
the
federal
trade
commission.
this
is
an
executive
branch
agency,
which
refers
cases
to
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecution
or
for
the
initiation
of
civil
actions.
nor
for
that
matter
does
the
agency
has
subpoena
power,
in
the
proceeding
it
does
conduct.
this
is
been
recently
pointed
out
in
the
study
by
the
administrative
conference
which
categorizes
fda
as
perhaps
the
most
important
agency
in
the
government
which
doesn't
have
any
subpoena
power.
so
the
agency,
the
congress
strengthened
in
1938.
just
to
repeat
it
once
more,
is
essentially
a
policing
agency
in
regard
to
drugs,
except
with
regard
to
new
drugs
has
specifically
defined
by
the
statute
and
that
is
the
class
of
drugs
with
which
--
are
now
which
in
this
case
are
concerned.
now
the
definition
of
new
drug
is
set
forth
in
201(p)
and
the
basic
function
of
201
(p)
is
to
act
as
a
bow
or
a
selecting
gate
to
determine
down
which
regulatory
road
a
particular
product
will
travel.
if
the
drug
is
a
new
drug,
as
defined
in
the
statute
then
it
is
channeled
into
an
administrative
applied
regulatory
scheme
conducted
by
the
food
and
drug
administration,
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drugs.
if
however
the
product
is
not
a
new
drug
as
defined
by
the
statute,
then
it
is
simply
outside
that
administrative
regulatory
scheme.
the
drug
is
regulated
in
the
civil
actions,
in
criminal
prosecutions
which
i
described
a
moment
ago.
the
standard
of
whether
a
product
is
a
new
drug
is
section
201
(p)
and
this
is
printed
at
page
3
of
our
brief
which
is
the
thick
blue
brief
and
also
at
page
482
of
the
joint
appendix
and
it
provides
that
a
drug
is
a
new
drug.
if
it
is
a
drug
a
composition
of
which
is
such
that
it
is
not
generally
recognized
by
qualified
experts
as
safe
and
effective
for
its
intended
uses.
now
in
1938,
when
this
statute
was
first
enacted,
the
word
effective
didn't
appear.
a
drug
was
regarded
as
a
new
drug
if
it
was
not
generally
recognized
as
safe
intended
uses,
effectiveness
didn't
enter
into
the
matter.
the
determination,
however,
whether
a
product
was
generally
recognized
to
say
is
a
factual
determination
and
once
that
a
factual
determination
as
to
the
state
of
informed
expert
opinion
on
the
product.
the
question
in
short
was
not
whether
the
drug
was
in
fact
safe,
because
it
might
in
fact
be
safe,
but
not
be
generally
recognized
as
safe,
the
question
was
whether
the
consensus
of
informed
expert
opinion
was
that
the
product
was
safe,
and
in
the
absence
of
such
a
consensus,
the
product
would
be
classified
as
a
new
drug.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
that
is
correct
with
a
qualification
that
i
would
like
to
state
at
this
time.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
as
to
whether
you
have
to
have
substantial
evidence
as
defined
in
the
statute
in
1962
that
is
controlled
clinical
studies
to
have
general
recognition.
the
government
says
that
you
do,
the
companies
in
these
cases
are
uniformly
i
believe
that
you
do
not
need
to
have
it
but
if
the
government
is
right,
that
an
expert
couldn't
possibly
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
the
safety
of
product
without
controlled
clinical
studies
or
for
that
matter
it's
effectiveness,
then
you
won't
be
able
to
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
well,
the
1962
act
defines
substantial
evidence
in
terms
of
controlled
clinical
studies
with
regard
to
the
application
of
the
standards
for
approval
or
disapproval
by
fda.
as
mr.
williams
pointed
out,
this
definition
does
not
in
terms
apply
to
the
question
of
general
recognition
for
purposes
of
classifying
the
drug
in
the
first
instance,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
the
experts
consensus
has
to
be
a
correct
one,
viewed
from
the
management
point
of
fda
or
anybody
else.
the
test
is
whether
there
is
a
consensus?
now,
if
the
government
is
right,
that
substantial
evidence
in
the
statutory
sense
of
effectiveness
under
the
new
statute,
or
under
the
old
statute
which
i
would
like
to
return
in
a
moment,
whether
there
is
a
consensus
as
to
substantial
evidence
of
safety.
if
that
depends
on
whether
there
are
controlled
clinical
studies
then
they
won't
be
a
consensus
because
if
the
government
is
right,
the
experts
simply
won't
come
to
a
conclusion,
if
they
are
really
qualified
experts.
it
may
be
that
they
will
come
to
that
conclusion
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
studies.
now
the
presence
of
studies
maybe
relevant
to
an
expert
in
deciding
that
he
does
or
he
doesn't
recognize
the
product
as
safe
or
it
is
effective
and
it
maybe
that
it
won't
recognize
that
it
is
safe
or
is
effective
if
they
are
any
studies,
but
the
statute
doesn't
tell
the
expert
on
what
basis
he
has
to
decide
for
the
purpose
of
the
consensus.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
the
statute
requires
a
controlled
study,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
so
only
if
a
product
is
a
new
drug
as
defined
by
the
statute
and
is
therefore
required
to
get
pre-marketing
clearance,
because
if
the
drug
is
not
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
for
a
new
drug
only
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
yes,
i
do.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
the
definition
is
the
statute's
definition
which
is
that
a
product
in
1962
--
up
until
1962,
the
definition
of
a
new
drug
was
a
product
which
is
not
generally
recognized
by
a
qualified
experts
as
safe
for
its
intended
uses.
products
which
were
generally
recognized
as
safe
didn't
require
pre-clearance
and
didn't
have
to
go
through
the
new
drug
procedure.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
after
the
62
act,
if
the
product
was
generally
recognized
to
safe
but
not
generally
recognized
as
effective,
then
it
was
a
new
drug.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
that's
correct.
now,
the
change
in
definition
of
new
drug,
so
as
to
expand
that
category,
to
expand
this
goal
of
the
administrative
regulatory
scheme,
that
amendment
would
in
the
absence
of
some
grandfather
clause
have
applied
across
the
board
to
all
products
that
were
on
the
market
in
1962.
congress
and
that
is
what
the
original
keith
howard
(ph)
bill
would
have
done.
congress
didn't
however
enact
the
original
keith
howard
(ph)
bill
in
that
respect,
it
added
transitional
provisions
and
it
added
a
grandfather
provision
and
the
precise
issue
in
this
case
is
the
scope
of
the
grandfather
provision.
so
that
it
can
be
determined
whether
or
not
a
pre
62
product
is
to
be
classified
as
a
new
drug
or
not
as
a
new
drug
according
to
the
new
definition
or
the
old
definition.
now
it
perhaps
would
be
helpful
just
for
a
moment
to
state
the
factual
origins
of
the
controversy
presented
in
this
particular
case.
for
many
years,
beginning
in
1955,
usv,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
marketed
a
line
of
products
principally
containing
a
substance
called
citrus
flavonoid
compound.
this
is
a
naturally
occurring
combination
of
substances
called
bioflavonoids
which
are
derived
from
citrus
fruits.
and
the
recommended
use
with
the
products
is
the
control
of
abnormal
capillary
permeability
and
fragility,
which
is
a
condition
of
the
capillary
walls,
sometimes
found
in
conjunction
with
serious
ailments
involved
in
bleeding.
this
side
condition
results
when
it
is
present
in
excessively
easy
rapture
of
the
tiny
capillary
blood
vessels
which
lie
near
the
surface
of
the
skin
or
near
internal
surfaces
and
usv’s
citrus
flavonoid
products
are
recommended
to
physicians
only
as
an
aid
of
strengthening
the
capillary
walls
and
in
that
sense
they
are
a
prescription
product
that
promoted
for
this
use
to
physicians
only
although
they
are
available
without
a
prescription.
if
you
went
and
asked
for
cvp
for
example
you
could
get
it,
but
there
will
be
nothing
on
the
box
to
tell
you
that
this
is
what
it
is
good
for.
the
promotion
is
only
to
physicians.
the
products
in
the
line
of
products
in
question
formed
two
separate
groups.
the
original
products
in
the
line
were
new
drugs
as
defined
by
the
statute
in
1955,
when
they
were
first
introduced
for
this
use
for
abnormal
capillary
permeability
and
fragility.
and
usv
therefore
filed
a
new
drug
applications
for
them
under
section
505
of
the
act.
now
by
new
drug
application,
i
also
mean
what
has
been
referred
to
today
as
nda.
now
this
act,
it
is
a
another
term
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute,
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
of
this
morning,
i
would
say
that
the
term
nda
does
mean
new
drug
application,
it
doesn't
mean
new
drug
approval.
it
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
statute,
this
acronym.
the
statute
talks
about
applications,
applications
under
section
505,
it
does
not
talk
about
ndas.
i
have
not
personally
heard
of
any
use
of
the
acronym
to
refer
to
a
new
drug
approval
until
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
the
bentex
case.
i
think
that
most
members
of
the
food
and
drug
bar
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that
it
refers
to
something
else.
the
common
understanding
of
nda
is
new
drug
application,
but
the
important
point
is
that
the
statute
doesn’t
talk
about
ndas,
whatever
nda
means,
it
talks
about
applications.
so
at
least
for
my
purposes
when
i
use
the
abbreviation,
i
am
referring
to
the
application,
the
new
drug
application.
after
the
new
drug
applications
filed
by
usv
have
become
effective
with
the
original
products
in
this
line
and
the
products
covered
by
them
had
become
generally
recognized
as
safe
for
their
recommended
use,
so
that
they
were
no
longer
new
drugs
for
that
use
as
defined
by
the
statute.
usv
introduced
two
additional
products
of
the
same
type.
new
editions
of
old
drugs
such
as
these
two
are
usually
called
'me-too'
products,
that's
another
term
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute,
it's
a
shorthand,
and
it
has
some
pejorative
connotations
that
were
perhaps
intended
by
those
who
developed
the
term,
but
i
think
today
it
has
no
such
connotations.
'me-too'
products
are
competing
products,
competitive
products.
they
are
brought
up
on
the
market
after
a
so
called
pioneer
product
that
has
been
on
the
market
sufficiently
long,
so
that
drugs
of
this
type
becomes
generally
recognized
as
safe.
these
two
products
were
never
the
subject
of
new
drug
applications.
the
manufacturer
never
filed
an
application
for
them.
they
were
simply
brought
out
as
drugs
not
new
drugs
or
as
old
drugs,
if
you
will.
there
was
no
new
drug
application
filed
for
them,
no
new
drug
application
became
effective
for
them,
they
were
never
regulated
as
new
drug
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
they
were
on
the
market
as
old
drugs
just
like
aspirin.
these
products
were
generally
recognized
as
safe
for
their
recommended
use
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
they
were
brought
on
the
market.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
if
they
no
effect
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
the
fda
could
recommend
to
the
department
of
justice
that
the
products
be
seized,
that
the
manufacturer
be
enjoined
from
further
distribution
whether
the
manufacturer
be
punished.
it
is
a
criminal
offense
under
the
act
of
marketing
misbranded
drug.
the
act
defined
misbranding
to
include
the
use
of
labeling
which
is
false
or
misleading
in
any
particular,
and
there
was
certainly
no
question
that
a
false
or
misleading
claim
for
effectiveness
for
a
drug
is
a
misbranding.
the
government
has
never
brought
such
an
action
against
the
products
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
that
would
be
the
remedy.
now
this
was
the
only
remedy
available
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
for
any
product
on
the
market
as
of
1962,
if
it
believed
that
the
product
was
not
effective
for
its
recommenced
uses.
however,
when
congress
amended
the
act
to
provide
a
degree
of
pre-marketing
control
over
products,
it
did
not
apply
that
pre-marketing
control
retrospectively
to
products
then
on
the
market
without
qualification.
instead
it
added
a
grandfather
clause
and
it's
the
scope
of
that
grandfather
clause
which
is
the
crux
of
the
controversy
between
usv
pharmaceutical
corporation
and
the
government.
the
question
as
i
said
is
which
definition
of
new
drug
applies.
the
grandfather
clause
says,
that
if
a
product
is
a
new
drug
under
the
new
definition,
it
still
may
not
be
required
to
go
through
the
pre-clearance
requirement,
if
three
conditions
are
met.
now
this
section
107
(c)
(4)
is
a
technical
and
very
precise
statute
and
it's
not
the
sort
of
provision
which
can
be
read
impermissible.
congress
spelt
out
its
three
criteria
extremely
carefully
and
we
think
a
broad-brush
treatment
of
the
complex
language
it
employed
would
not
do
justice
to
the
statute.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
482
mr.
chief
justice
and
also
at
page
3
of
petitioner's
brief
in
666.
page
482
sets
out
section
107
(c)
(4)
of
the
act
and
this
is
the
first
non-indented
paragraph,
a
little
bit
below
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
the
three
criteria
are
first
that
the
product
had
been
marketed
in
the
united
states
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1962
amendments.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
products
involved
in
this
case
were
so
marketed
and
that
the
products
in
this
case
therefore
meet
the
first
criterion
for
grandfather
protection.
the
second
requirement
is
that
the
product
was
not
a
new
drug
under
the
statute
as
it
stood
when
the
amendments
were
adopted.
that
is
that
the
product
was
then
generally
recognized
by
qualified
experts
as
safe
for
its
recommended
uses.
and
the
district
court
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
in
1962
the
products
involved
in
this
case
were
generally
recognized
as
safe
for
their
recommended
uses.
that
the
products,
therefore,
were
not
new
drugs
when
the
statute
was
amended,
so
that
the
second
criterion
for
grandfather
status
is
also
met.
the
third
requirement
for
grandfather
status
is
the
one
that
brings
us
here
today.
that
requirement
is
that
the
product
was
not
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505
of
the
act,
the
time
the
statute
was
amended
and
the
controversy
today
is
over
the
proper
construction
of
this
third
criterion.
in
other
words,
i
say,
usv
never
filed
an
application
under
section
505
for
either
of
its
two
''me-too''
products.
this
was
because
each
was
considered
from
the
outset
by
usv
to
be
generally
recognized
by
qualified
experts
as
safe
for
its
intended
uses,
and
therefore,
was
not
a
new
drug.
new
drug
applications
were
not
required
for
such
products
and
the
marketing
of
each
of
these
''me-too''
products
was
initiated
and
continued
on
the
strength
general
recognition
of
safety.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
products
were
marketed
and
it
was
the
only
basis.
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
that
products
such
as
these
meet
literally
the
criteria
for
exemption
stated
in
the
grandfather
clause,
and
this
is
at
page
470
of
the
appendix,
meet
literally
the
criteria
for
exemption.
we
agree,
but
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
usv's
products
in
this
category
do
not
reach
grandfather
status,
notwithstanding
that
they
--
literally
the
requirements
for
invention
because
usv
as
the
manufacturer
was
itself
the
applicant
under
the
ndas
for
early
additions
of
the
products
which
were
first
marketed
under
effective
ndas.
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
insofar
as
a
true
distinction
on
the
basis
of
identity
of
the
manufacturer
and
his
role
in
the
marketing
other
products,
the
government
agrees
with
us
that
no
such
distinction
is
supportable.
the
government
agrees,
in
other
words,
that
if
a
product
was
a
'me-too'
version
of
an
earlier
product,
it
matters
not
who
the
original
manufacturer
was,
and
the
government
therefore
agrees
that
our
'me-too'
products
will
be
treated
just
like
everybody
else's,
but
we
differ
as
to
what
that
treatment
should
be.
the
government
argues
for
affirmance
of
the
judgment
as
to
usv's
products
by
attacking
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
as
to
never
nda
'me-too'
products
in
general.
the
government
argues
that
notwithstanding
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
products
meet
literally
the
criteria
for
exemption
that
they
don't
really
qualify
after
all.
so
the
question
before
this
court
as
to
the
'me-too'
products
is
the
correction
of
the
ruling
below
as
modify
in
accordance
with
the
government's
concession
that
congress
did
confer
grandfather
status
on
never
nda
products,
even
thought
they
were
later
versions
of
earlier
products.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
we
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
parents
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
if
the
parents
drug,
the
pioneer
drug
were
protected
by
the
grandfather
clause
which
is
the
other
issue
in
this
case,
but
one
which
is
for
the
shortage
of
the
time,
i
would
prefer
to
put
aside
and
leave
on
briefs,
if
the
pioneer
products
are
protected
by
the
grandfather
clause,
then,
yes,
the
'me-toos'
would
follow
along,
because
the
only
basis
for
the
government
argument
that
the
'me-toos'
aren't
grandfather
is
that
the
pioneers
are
the
grandfather,
but
regardless
of
this
court's
decision
on
the
original
products
that
were
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505,
the
'me-too'
products
in
our
view
independently
meet
the
criteria
for
exemption,
because
these
products
never
were
covered
by
an
effective
application.
they
weren't
covered
in
62,
they
weren't
covered
in
58,
they
weren't
covered
in
55,
they
were
never
covered
by
an
effective
application.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
didn't
get
a
piggyback,
because
they
are
marketing
in
way
dependent
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
new
drug
and
application
effective
for
some
other
product.
the
marketing
depended
solely
on
the
fact
that
this
product
had
become
--
this
type
of
product
had
become
generally
recognized
as
safe
for
its
intended
uses.
if
there
could
have
been
no
prior
product,
but
there
were
general
recognition
of
safety
under
whatever
standard
applied
then
these
products
would
have
come
on
the
market.
the
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
exactly,
the
'me-too'
met
the
test
of
the
38
act,
was
not
a
new
drug,
was
marketed
as
a
drug
other
than
a
new
drug.
it
did
not
depend
for
its
law
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
before
1962
or
for
that
matter,
today.
the
'me-too'
product
came
on
the
market
because
it
was
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
therefore
not
a
new
drug
under
the
1938
act.
it
continues
on
the
market
today
in
usv’s
view
because
while
it
would
not
meet
the
amended
definition,
so
that
it
would
require
pre-clearance
by
fda
if
the
amended
definition
applied,
our
view
is
that
the
grandfather
clause
withholds
the
amended
definition
from
this
product
that
was
on
the
market
prior
to
1962.
the
correctness
of
the
decision
below
as
to
these
'me-too'
products
is
shown,
we
think
by
three
principle
considerations
which
have
gone
into
in
our
brief
and
if
i
may
briefly
summarize;
first,
is
the
literal
language
of
clause
(c)
of
section
107
(c)
(4)
construed
in
accordance
with
congress’s
demonstrative
understanding
of
that
language
and
of
the
concepts
it
incorporates.
that
concept
is
the
concept
of
an
effective
application
under
505.
now
the
government
says
505
is
irrelevant
in
construing
the
grandfather
clause,
but
it's
not
irrelevant.
how
can
it
be
irrelevant
if
clause
(c)
says
that
one
of
the
criteria
for
grandfather
protection
is
whether
the
product
was
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505.
so
the
critical
question
in
terms
of
statutory
language
we
think
is
what
did
congress
think,
what
it
meant
when
it
used
the
words
effective
application
under
section
505.
now
we
think
congress
was
pretty
clear
as
to
what
that
meant.
our
brief
explains
that
it
was
explicitly
called
for
the
attention
of
congress
by
secretary
rebikoff
that
ineffective
application
under
section
505
was
a
one-trip
ticket
only.
it
was
good
for
the
manufacturer
who
filed
the
product
and
it
was
good
only
for
the
product
for
which
that
application
was
filed,
not
for
anybody
else's
product
and
not
for
any
other
product
of
the
same
manufacturer.
congress
reflected
its
understanding
of
this
concept
in
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
which
are
discussed
in
our
brief
and
while
it
did
not
address
the
subject
of
'me-too'
products
directly
at
any
time
as
the
government
points
out;
that
is
only
to
show
simply
that
congress
may
not
have
been
aware
that
the
statute
it
did
enact
would
protect
“me-toos,”
but
whether
congress
was
aware
of
it
or
not,
this
is
the
statute
they
enacted
and
our
position
is
that
when
congress
set
up
as
a
criterion
for
grandfather
protection,
that
the
product
not
be
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505
that
the
case
has
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
what
congress
thought
was
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505.
the
second
consideration
that
we
think
militates
in
favor
of
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
on
these
two
products
in
general,
is
that
the
only
available
evidence
of
congress’s
purpose,
in
amending
the
definition
of
new
drug
in
the
first
place,
shows
a
very
limited
purpose.
remember,
the
grandfather
provision
controls
the
applicability
of
the
amendment
to
that
section
201
(p)
definition
of
a
new
drug.
so
we
believe
that's
relevant
to
inquire
what
was
congress’s
purpose
in
amending
the
definition.
the
government
has
stated
in
its
brief
that
they
agree
that
there
is
only
a
limited
evidence
of
purpose
in
the
legislative
history
and
that
purpose
was
to
clear
up
some
confusion
that
was
prevalent
in
the
senate
at
the
time
that
the
new
drug
definition
was
amended.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
ensure
that
new
claims
for
our
old
products
would
be
covered
by
the
new
definition.
so
that
if
aspirin
would
have
been
newly
recommended
for
acne,
for
example;
to
give
examples
when
you
used
here
this
morning,
then
a
new
drug
application
would
have
to
be
filed
for
aspirin
insofar
as
it
was
being
recommended
for
the
new
use,
that
was
the
purpose.
that
was
the
only
purpose
that
is
evidenced
in
the
legislative
history
and
we
think
that
because
'me-too'
products
obviously
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
purpose
that
the
statute
should
not
be
distorted
so
as
to
deny
these
products,
the
grandfather
status,
which
congress
literally
and
explicitly
conferred
on
them.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
prefer
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
i
will
try
not
to
use
them
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
being
grateful
for
the
expansion
of
the
time.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
mr.
frey
has
said
quite
correctly
that
section
107
(c)
(4),
page
482,
refers
to
a
drug
rather
than
to
a
product,
but
that
doesn't
advance
ball
any
in
our
opinion.
he
says
that,
201
(p)
is
generic
and
therefore
107
(c)
(4)
must
be
generic.
but
again
he
stressed,
that
as
the
government
did
in
its
brief,
it
just
ignores
the
fact
that
in
carving
out
an
exemption
from
the
applicability
of
the
amended
definition
which
is
generic,
congress
made
that
exemption
turn
on
a
highly
personal
and
particularized
factor,
namely
was
the
drug,
now
mr.
frey
said
in
the
statute
where
it
was
the
drug
covered
by
ineffective
application.
now
if
mr.
frey
is
right
and
a
drug
is
covered
by
an
effective
application
and
if
any
member
of
its
generic
class
is
covered
then
once
the
first
nda
is
approved,
nobody
else
need
to
file
a
new
drug
application
because
section
505
(a),
the
basic
statutory
requirement
and
this
is
on
page
477,
505
(a)
says,
“no
person
shall
introduce
or
deliver
any
new
drug
unless
an
approval
of
an
application
filed
pursuant
to
sub-section
(b)
is
effective
with
respect
to
such
drug.”
now
if
the
word
drug
is
generic
than
its
generic.
if
it's
personal,
it's
personal.
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
that
what
makes
the
201
(p)
definition
generic
is
the
rather
awkward
phrasing,
that
a
new
drug
is
any
drug,
the
composition
of
which
is
such
that
it
is
not
generally
recognized
by
experts.
now
that's
not
found
anywhere
in
the
statute.
107,
except
201
(p),
the
grandfather
clause
doesn't
say
that
a
product
is
disqualified
from
grandfather
status.
if
it's
a
product,
the
composition
of
which
is
such
that
is
covered
by
a
new
application,
and
so
we
therefore
rest
on
the
proposition
that
congress
enacted
a
statute.
mr.
frey
is
not
testifying
before
a
legislative
committee.
he
is
here
before
this
court
asking
it
to
interpret
what
congress
wrote.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
we
think,
there
are
not
regulatory
schemes
that
are
precisely
like
this,
in
the
respect
to
which
your
honor
refers.
i
am
not
a
securities
lawyer.
my
understanding,
however
is
that,
for
example,
if
a
person
violates
the
securities
act,
by
failing
to
comply
with
registration
requirements,
and
like
the
principal
remedy,
and
i
am
just
not
certain
if
it's
the
only
one,
but
the
principal
remedies
inaction
in
the
district
courts,
and
the
action
i
might
add,
need
not
be
criminal.
the
government
has
civil
remedies
available.
it
can
cease
the
products,
it
can
enjoin
with
the
civil
burden
of
preponderance
of
evidence
burden.
and
as
far
as
the
necessity
of
bringing
thousands
of
suits
is
concerned,
we
think
the
history
of
the
regulatory
statute
in
question
shows
that
where
a
point
is
established,
if
it
has
relevance
to
other
cases,
it
need
not
be
litigated
thousands
of
times.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
i
do
have
an
answer,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
i
may
state
just
briefly.
the
congress
continued
in
courts
usually
as
to
the
products
that
were
on
market
in
1962.
whatever
regulatory
scheme
was
then
in
courts
as
to
that
product,
if
a
product
was
being
regulated,
as
a
new
drug,
and
actively
regulated,
then
it
would
continue
to
be
so
regulative
under
the
amended
schemes.
if
it
wasn't
being
regulated
under
the
administrative
new
drug
scheme,
which
is
traditional
to
'me-too',
that
it
continued
not
to
be.
now
this
may
be
seen
as
unfair
and
the
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
association
have
suggested
that
in
fact
anti-aid
products,
which
would
become
no
longer
in
use,
are
not
subject
to
the
amended
definition
of
new
drug
either.
that
issue
is
present
in
our
case,
with
a
refinement.
we
are
in
position
of
--
as
the
district
court
found
having
withdrawn
the
applications
from
fda,
but
that
is
an
entirely
a
separate
issue,
which
they
simply
haven't
been
timed
to
discuss.
we
think
in
other
words
this
is
not
anomalous
anymore
than
any
grandfather
clause
is
anomalous,
that
distinguishes
between
products
in
various
regulatory
statuses
when
statute
is
amended,
but
if
there
is
an
anomaly;
it's
for
congress,
and
not
for
this
court
to
adjudicate.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fifth
and
final
case
in
these
consolidated
proceedings
is
usv
pharmaceutical
corporation
against
wienberger.
this
case
is
here
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
like
ciba
and
bentex,
it
arose
as
a
civil
action
in
the
district
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
the
products
involved
are
not
new
drugs
as
define
by
the
act.
the
issues
in
the
usv
case
involve
solely
the
interpretation
of
the
grandfather
clause
in
the
1962
amendments,
section
107
(c)
(4).
the
district
court
held
that
the
products
involved
do
enjoy
grandfather
status
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
do
not.
now
before
proceeding
to
the
specifics
of
this
case
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
step
back
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
overall
statutory
scheme
which
we
have
been
discussing,
since
10
o'
clock
this
morning.
there
has
been
some
imprecise
use
of
terms
during
the
course
of
the
arguments
and
with
the
court
permission
i
should
like
to
briefly
restate
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
with
which
we
are
confronted.
there
are
only
two
relevant
terms
used
in
the
statute
of
all
those
shorthand
expressions
that
have
been
brought
up
today.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
the
term
“old
drug”
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
there
are
only
two
terms,
the
terms
are
“drug”
and
“new
drug”
both
of
these
are
specifically
defined
in
the
act.
and
for
present
purposes
we
need
not
get
into
the
details
of
the
definition
of
the
drug
generally.
we
can
just
assume
that
this
refers
to
what
we
normally
think
of
as
drugs,
but
the
term
“new
drug”
in
explicitly
defined.
a
special
class
of
drugs
is
carved
out
is
define
by
section
201
(p)
of
the
act
and
this
is
been
so
since
1938,
so
that
the
act
regulates
all
drugs.
it
regulated
drugs
generally
in
a
certain
manner
and
it
regulates
new
drugs
in
a
very
specific
manner.
this
scheme
is
described
in
the
brief
for
the
proprietary
association
which
is
the
thick
light
green
brief
at
pages
4-9
and
also
in
the
pma
brief
which
is
this
thick
dark
green
brief
at
pages
28-29
and
rather
than
repeat
what
it
said
there
let
me
simply
summarize.
in
1938,
the
basic
food
and
drug
act,
pure
food
and
drug
act
in
1906
was
totally
revamped
to
strengthen
the
authority
of
food
and
drug
administration
to
protect
the
public
in
the
field
of
drugs,
this
obviously
is
true.
but
the
powers
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
strengthened
very
largely
by
way
of
increasing
their
authority
as
an
enforcement
agency,
a
prosecutor
if
you
will,
in
the
district
courts.
the
basic
statutory
scheme
which
applies
to
the
regulation
of
drugs
contemplates
that
the
substantive
probations
of
the
act
will
enforced
in
civil
or
criminal
actions
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
on
the
reference
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
the
district
courts,
so
that
if
the
drug
is
misbranded
the
remedy
available
to
the
government
is
a
civil
action
to
seize
the
product
or
for
an
injunction
or
a
criminal
prosecution.
if
a
drug
is
adulterated,
the
same
remedies
are
available,
a
civil
action
procedure
or
for
an
injunction
or
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
no
direct
authority
with
an
exception
that
i
will
refer
to
in
a
few
moments,
to
directly
enforce
these
prohibitions.
as
was
pointed
out
in
response
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
agency
has
no
seize
and
desist
order
--
authority.
this
is
not
the
federal
trade
commission.
this
is
an
executive
branch
agency,
which
refers
cases
to
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecution
or
for
the
initiation
of
civil
actions.
nor
for
that
matter
does
the
agency
has
subpoena
power,
in
the
proceeding
it
does
conduct.
this
is
been
recently
pointed
out
in
the
study
by
the
administrative
conference
which
categorizes
fda
as
perhaps
the
most
important
agency
in
the
government
which
doesn't
have
any
subpoena
power.
so
the
agency,
the
congress
strengthened
in
1938.
just
to
repeat
it
once
more,
is
essentially
a
policing
agency
in
regard
to
drugs,
except
with
regard
to
new
drugs
has
specifically
defined
by
the
statute
and
that
is
the
class
of
drugs
with
which
--
are
now
which
in
this
case
are
concerned.
now
the
definition
of
new
drug
is
set
forth
in
201(p)
and
the
basic
function
of
201
(p)
is
to
act
as
a
bow
or
a
selecting
gate
to
determine
down
which
regulatory
road
a
particular
product
will
travel.
if
the
drug
is
a
new
drug,
as
defined
in
the
statute
then
it
is
channeled
into
an
administrative
applied
regulatory
scheme
conducted
by
the
food
and
drug
administration,
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drugs.
if
however
the
product
is
not
a
new
drug
as
defined
by
the
statute,
then
it
is
simply
outside
that
administrative
regulatory
scheme.
the
drug
is
regulated
in
the
civil
actions,
in
criminal
prosecutions
which
i
described
a
moment
ago.
the
standard
of
whether
a
product
is
a
new
drug
is
section
201
(p)
and
this
is
printed
at
page
3
of
our
brief
which
is
the
thick
blue
brief
and
also
at
page
482
of
the
joint
appendix
and
it
provides
that
a
drug
is
a
new
drug.
if
it
is
a
drug
a
composition
of
which
is
such
that
it
is
not
generally
recognized
by
qualified
experts
as
safe
and
effective
for
its
intended
uses.
now
in
1938,
when
this
statute
was
first
enacted,
the
word
effective
didn't
appear.
a
drug
was
regarded
as
a
new
drug
if
it
was
not
generally
recognized
as
safe
intended
uses,
effectiveness
didn't
enter
into
the
matter.
the
determination,
however,
whether
a
product
was
generally
recognized
to
say
is
a
factual
determination
and
once
that
a
factual
determination
as
to
the
state
of
informed
expert
opinion
on
the
product.
the
question
in
short
was
not
whether
the
drug
was
in
fact
safe,
because
it
might
in
fact
be
safe,
but
not
be
generally
recognized
as
safe,
the
question
was
whether
the
consensus
of
informed
expert
opinion
was
that
the
product
was
safe,
and
in
the
absence
of
such
a
consensus,
the
product
would
be
classified
as
a
new
drug.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
that
is
correct
with
a
qualification
that
i
would
like
to
state
at
this
time.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
as
to
whether
you
have
to
have
substantial
evidence
as
defined
in
the
statute
in
1962
that
is
controlled
clinical
studies
to
have
general
recognition.
the
government
says
that
you
do,
the
companies
in
these
cases
are
uniformly
i
believe
that
you
do
not
need
to
have
it
but
if
the
government
is
right,
that
an
expert
couldn't
possibly
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
the
safety
of
product
without
controlled
clinical
studies
or
for
that
matter
it's
effectiveness,
then
you
won't
be
able
to
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
well,
the
1962
act
defines
substantial
evidence
in
terms
of
controlled
clinical
studies
with
regard
to
the
application
of
the
standards
for
approval
or
disapproval
by
fda.
as
mr.
williams
pointed
out,
this
definition
does
not
in
terms
apply
to
the
question
of
general
recognition
for
purposes
of
classifying
the
drug
in
the
first
instance,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
the
experts
consensus
has
to
be
a
correct
one,
viewed
from
the
management
point
of
fda
or
anybody
else.
the
test
is
whether
there
is
a
consensus?
now,
if
the
government
is
right,
that
substantial
evidence
in
the
statutory
sense
of
effectiveness
under
the
new
statute,
or
under
the
old
statute
which
i
would
like
to
return
in
a
moment,
whether
there
is
a
consensus
as
to
substantial
evidence
of
safety.
if
that
depends
on
whether
there
are
controlled
clinical
studies
then
they
won't
be
a
consensus
because
if
the
government
is
right,
the
experts
simply
won't
come
to
a
conclusion,
if
they
are
really
qualified
experts.
it
may
be
that
they
will
come
to
that
conclusion
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
studies.
now
the
presence
of
studies
maybe
relevant
to
an
expert
in
deciding
that
he
does
or
he
doesn't
recognize
the
product
as
safe
or
it
is
effective
and
it
maybe
that
it
won't
recognize
that
it
is
safe
or
is
effective
if
they
are
any
studies,
but
the
statute
doesn't
tell
the
expert
on
what
basis
he
has
to
decide
for
the
purpose
of
the
consensus.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
the
statute
requires
a
controlled
study,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
so
only
if
a
product
is
a
new
drug
as
defined
by
the
statute
and
is
therefore
required
to
get
pre-marketing
clearance,
because
if
the
drug
is
not
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
for
a
new
drug
only
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
yes,
i
do.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
the
definition
is
the
statute's
definition
which
is
that
a
product
in
1962
--
up
until
1962,
the
definition
of
a
new
drug
was
a
product
which
is
not
generally
recognized
by
a
qualified
experts
as
safe
for
its
intended
uses.
products
which
were
generally
recognized
as
safe
didn't
require
pre-clearance
and
didn't
have
to
go
through
the
new
drug
procedure.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
after
the
62
act,
if
the
product
was
generally
recognized
to
safe
but
not
generally
recognized
as
effective,
then
it
was
a
new
drug.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
that's
correct.
now,
the
change
in
definition
of
new
drug,
so
as
to
expand
that
category,
to
expand
this
goal
of
the
administrative
regulatory
scheme,
that
amendment
would
in
the
absence
of
some
grandfather
clause
have
applied
across
the
board
to
all
products
that
were
on
the
market
in
1962.
congress
and
that
is
what
the
original
keith
howard
(ph)
bill
would
have
done.
congress
didn't
however
enact
the
original
keith
howard
(ph)
bill
in
that
respect,
it
added
transitional
provisions
and
it
added
a
grandfather
provision
and
the
precise
issue
in
this
case
is
the
scope
of
the
grandfather
provision.
so
that
it
can
be
determined
whether
or
not
a
pre
62
product
is
to
be
classified
as
a
new
drug
or
not
as
a
new
drug
according
to
the
new
definition
or
the
old
definition.
now
it
perhaps
would
be
helpful
just
for
a
moment
to
state
the
factual
origins
of
the
controversy
presented
in
this
particular
case.
for
many
years,
beginning
in
1955,
usv,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
marketed
a
line
of
products
principally
containing
a
substance
called
citrus
flavonoid
compound.
this
is
a
naturally
occurring
combination
of
substances
called
bioflavonoids
which
are
derived
from
citrus
fruits.
and
the
recommended
use
with
the
products
is
the
control
of
abnormal
capillary
permeability
and
fragility,
which
is
a
condition
of
the
capillary
walls,
sometimes
found
in
conjunction
with
serious
ailments
involved
in
bleeding.
this
side
condition
results
when
it
is
present
in
excessively
easy
rapture
of
the
tiny
capillary
blood
vessels
which
lie
near
the
surface
of
the
skin
or
near
internal
surfaces
and
usv’s
citrus
flavonoid
products
are
recommended
to
physicians
only
as
an
aid
of
strengthening
the
capillary
walls
and
in
that
sense
they
are
a
prescription
product
that
promoted
for
this
use
to
physicians
only
although
they
are
available
without
a
prescription.
if
you
went
and
asked
for
cvp
for
example
you
could
get
it,
but
there
will
be
nothing
on
the
box
to
tell
you
that
this
is
what
it
is
good
for.
the
promotion
is
only
to
physicians.
the
products
in
the
line
of
products
in
question
formed
two
separate
groups.
the
original
products
in
the
line
were
new
drugs
as
defined
by
the
statute
in
1955,
when
they
were
first
introduced
for
this
use
for
abnormal
capillary
permeability
and
fragility.
and
usv
therefore
filed
a
new
drug
applications
for
them
under
section
505
of
the
act.
now
by
new
drug
application,
i
also
mean
what
has
been
referred
to
today
as
nda.
now
this
act,
it
is
a
another
term
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute,
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
of
this
morning,
i
would
say
that
the
term
nda
does
mean
new
drug
application,
it
doesn't
mean
new
drug
approval.
it
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
statute,
this
acronym.
the
statute
talks
about
applications,
applications
under
section
505,
it
does
not
talk
about
ndas.
i
have
not
personally
heard
of
any
use
of
the
acronym
to
refer
to
a
new
drug
approval
until
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
the
bentex
case.
i
think
that
most
members
of
the
food
and
drug
bar
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that
it
refers
to
something
else.
the
common
understanding
of
nda
is
new
drug
application,
but
the
important
point
is
that
the
statute
doesn’t
talk
about
ndas,
whatever
nda
means,
it
talks
about
applications.
so
at
least
for
my
purposes
when
i
use
the
abbreviation,
i
am
referring
to
the
application,
the
new
drug
application.
after
the
new
drug
applications
filed
by
usv
have
become
effective
with
the
original
products
in
this
line
and
the
products
covered
by
them
had
become
generally
recognized
as
safe
for
their
recommended
use,
so
that
they
were
no
longer
new
drugs
for
that
use
as
defined
by
the
statute.
usv
introduced
two
additional
products
of
the
same
type.
new
editions
of
old
drugs
such
as
these
two
are
usually
called
'me-too'
products,
that's
another
term
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute,
it's
a
shorthand,
and
it
has
some
pejorative
connotations
that
were
perhaps
intended
by
those
who
developed
the
term,
but
i
think
today
it
has
no
such
connotations.
'me-too'
products
are
competing
products,
competitive
products.
they
are
brought
up
on
the
market
after
a
so
called
pioneer
product
that
has
been
on
the
market
sufficiently
long,
so
that
drugs
of
this
type
becomes
generally
recognized
as
safe.
these
two
products
were
never
the
subject
of
new
drug
applications.
the
manufacturer
never
filed
an
application
for
them.
they
were
simply
brought
out
as
drugs
not
new
drugs
or
as
old
drugs,
if
you
will.
there
was
no
new
drug
application
filed
for
them,
no
new
drug
application
became
effective
for
them,
they
were
never
regulated
as
new
drug
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
they
were
on
the
market
as
old
drugs
just
like
aspirin.
these
products
were
generally
recognized
as
safe
for
their
recommended
use
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
they
were
brought
on
the
market.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
if
they
no
effect
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
the
fda
could
recommend
to
the
department
of
justice
that
the
products
be
seized,
that
the
manufacturer
be
enjoined
from
further
distribution
whether
the
manufacturer
be
punished.
it
is
a
criminal
offense
under
the
act
of
marketing
misbranded
drug.
the
act
defined
misbranding
to
include
the
use
of
labeling
which
is
false
or
misleading
in
any
particular,
and
there
was
certainly
no
question
that
a
false
or
misleading
claim
for
effectiveness
for
a
drug
is
a
misbranding.
the
government
has
never
brought
such
an
action
against
the
products
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
that
would
be
the
remedy.
now
this
was
the
only
remedy
available
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
for
any
product
on
the
market
as
of
1962,
if
it
believed
that
the
product
was
not
effective
for
its
recommenced
uses.
however,
when
congress
amended
the
act
to
provide
a
degree
of
pre-marketing
control
over
products,
it
did
not
apply
that
pre-marketing
control
retrospectively
to
products
then
on
the
market
without
qualification.
instead
it
added
a
grandfather
clause
and
it's
the
scope
of
that
grandfather
clause
which
is
the
crux
of
the
controversy
between
usv
pharmaceutical
corporation
and
the
government.
the
question
as
i
said
is
which
definition
of
new
drug
applies.
the
grandfather
clause
says,
that
if
a
product
is
a
new
drug
under
the
new
definition,
it
still
may
not
be
required
to
go
through
the
pre-clearance
requirement,
if
three
conditions
are
met.
now
this
section
107
(c)
(4)
is
a
technical
and
very
precise
statute
and
it's
not
the
sort
of
provision
which
can
be
read
impermissible.
congress
spelt
out
its
three
criteria
extremely
carefully
and
we
think
a
broad-brush
treatment
of
the
complex
language
it
employed
would
not
do
justice
to
the
statute.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
482
mr.
chief
justice
and
also
at
page
3
of
petitioner's
brief
in
666.
page
482
sets
out
section
107
(c)
(4)
of
the
act
and
this
is
the
first
non-indented
paragraph,
a
little
bit
below
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
the
three
criteria
are
first
that
the
product
had
been
marketed
in
the
united
states
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1962
amendments.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
products
involved
in
this
case
were
so
marketed
and
that
the
products
in
this
case
therefore
meet
the
first
criterion
for
grandfather
protection.
the
second
requirement
is
that
the
product
was
not
a
new
drug
under
the
statute
as
it
stood
when
the
amendments
were
adopted.
that
is
that
the
product
was
then
generally
recognized
by
qualified
experts
as
safe
for
its
recommended
uses.
and
the
district
court
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
in
1962
the
products
involved
in
this
case
were
generally
recognized
as
safe
for
their
recommended
uses.
that
the
products,
therefore,
were
not
new
drugs
when
the
statute
was
amended,
so
that
the
second
criterion
for
grandfather
status
is
also
met.
the
third
requirement
for
grandfather
status
is
the
one
that
brings
us
here
today.
that
requirement
is
that
the
product
was
not
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505
of
the
act,
the
time
the
statute
was
amended
and
the
controversy
today
is
over
the
proper
construction
of
this
third
criterion.
in
other
words,
i
say,
usv
never
filed
an
application
under
section
505
for
either
of
its
two
''me-too''
products.
this
was
because
each
was
considered
from
the
outset
by
usv
to
be
generally
recognized
by
qualified
experts
as
safe
for
its
intended
uses,
and
therefore,
was
not
a
new
drug.
new
drug
applications
were
not
required
for
such
products
and
the
marketing
of
each
of
these
''me-too''
products
was
initiated
and
continued
on
the
strength
general
recognition
of
safety.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
products
were
marketed
and
it
was
the
only
basis.
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
that
products
such
as
these
meet
literally
the
criteria
for
exemption
stated
in
the
grandfather
clause,
and
this
is
at
page
470
of
the
appendix,
meet
literally
the
criteria
for
exemption.
we
agree,
but
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
usv's
products
in
this
category
do
not
reach
grandfather
status,
notwithstanding
that
they
--
literally
the
requirements
for
invention
because
usv
as
the
manufacturer
was
itself
the
applicant
under
the
ndas
for
early
additions
of
the
products
which
were
first
marketed
under
effective
ndas.
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
insofar
as
a
true
distinction
on
the
basis
of
identity
of
the
manufacturer
and
his
role
in
the
marketing
other
products,
the
government
agrees
with
us
that
no
such
distinction
is
supportable.
the
government
agrees,
in
other
words,
that
if
a
product
was
a
'me-too'
version
of
an
earlier
product,
it
matters
not
who
the
original
manufacturer
was,
and
the
government
therefore
agrees
that
our
'me-too'
products
will
be
treated
just
like
everybody
else's,
but
we
differ
as
to
what
that
treatment
should
be.
the
government
argues
for
affirmance
of
the
judgment
as
to
usv's
products
by
attacking
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
as
to
never
nda
'me-too'
products
in
general.
the
government
argues
that
notwithstanding
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
products
meet
literally
the
criteria
for
exemption
that
they
don't
really
qualify
after
all.
so
the
question
before
this
court
as
to
the
'me-too'
products
is
the
correction
of
the
ruling
below
as
modify
in
accordance
with
the
government's
concession
that
congress
did
confer
grandfather
status
on
never
nda
products,
even
thought
they
were
later
versions
of
earlier
products.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
we
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
parents
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
if
the
parents
drug,
the
pioneer
drug
were
protected
by
the
grandfather
clause
which
is
the
other
issue
in
this
case,
but
one
which
is
for
the
shortage
of
the
time,
i
would
prefer
to
put
aside
and
leave
on
briefs,
if
the
pioneer
products
are
protected
by
the
grandfather
clause,
then,
yes,
the
'me-toos'
would
follow
along,
because
the
only
basis
for
the
government
argument
that
the
'me-toos'
aren't
grandfather
is
that
the
pioneers
are
the
grandfather,
but
regardless
of
this
court's
decision
on
the
original
products
that
were
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505,
the
'me-too'
products
in
our
view
independently
meet
the
criteria
for
exemption,
because
these
products
never
were
covered
by
an
effective
application.
they
weren't
covered
in
62,
they
weren't
covered
in
58,
they
weren't
covered
in
55,
they
were
never
covered
by
an
effective
application.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
didn't
get
a
piggyback,
because
they
are
marketing
in
way
dependent
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
new
drug
and
application
effective
for
some
other
product.
the
marketing
depended
solely
on
the
fact
that
this
product
had
become
--
this
type
of
product
had
become
generally
recognized
as
safe
for
its
intended
uses.
if
there
could
have
been
no
prior
product,
but
there
were
general
recognition
of
safety
under
whatever
standard
applied
then
these
products
would
have
come
on
the
market.
the
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
exactly,
the
'me-too'
met
the
test
of
the
38
act,
was
not
a
new
drug,
was
marketed
as
a
drug
other
than
a
new
drug.
it
did
not
depend
for
its
law
--
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
before
1962
or
for
that
matter,
today.
the
'me-too'
product
came
on
the
market
because
it
was
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
therefore
not
a
new
drug
under
the
1938
act.
it
continues
on
the
market
today
in
usv’s
view
because
while
it
would
not
meet
the
amended
definition,
so
that
it
would
require
pre-clearance
by
fda
if
the
amended
definition
applied,
our
view
is
that
the
grandfather
clause
withholds
the
amended
definition
from
this
product
that
was
on
the
market
prior
to
1962.
the
correctness
of
the
decision
below
as
to
these
'me-too'
products
is
shown,
we
think
by
three
principle
considerations
which
have
gone
into
in
our
brief
and
if
i
may
briefly
summarize;
first,
is
the
literal
language
of
clause
(c)
of
section
107
(c)
(4)
construed
in
accordance
with
congress’s
demonstrative
understanding
of
that
language
and
of
the
concepts
it
incorporates.
that
concept
is
the
concept
of
an
effective
application
under
505.
now
the
government
says
505
is
irrelevant
in
construing
the
grandfather
clause,
but
it's
not
irrelevant.
how
can
it
be
irrelevant
if
clause
(c)
says
that
one
of
the
criteria
for
grandfather
protection
is
whether
the
product
was
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505.
so
the
critical
question
in
terms
of
statutory
language
we
think
is
what
did
congress
think,
what
it
meant
when
it
used
the
words
effective
application
under
section
505.
now
we
think
congress
was
pretty
clear
as
to
what
that
meant.
our
brief
explains
that
it
was
explicitly
called
for
the
attention
of
congress
by
secretary
rebikoff
that
ineffective
application
under
section
505
was
a
one-trip
ticket
only.
it
was
good
for
the
manufacturer
who
filed
the
product
and
it
was
good
only
for
the
product
for
which
that
application
was
filed,
not
for
anybody
else's
product
and
not
for
any
other
product
of
the
same
manufacturer.
congress
reflected
its
understanding
of
this
concept
in
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
which
are
discussed
in
our
brief
and
while
it
did
not
address
the
subject
of
'me-too'
products
directly
at
any
time
as
the
government
points
out;
that
is
only
to
show
simply
that
congress
may
not
have
been
aware
that
the
statute
it
did
enact
would
protect
“me-toos,”
but
whether
congress
was
aware
of
it
or
not,
this
is
the
statute
they
enacted
and
our
position
is
that
when
congress
set
up
as
a
criterion
for
grandfather
protection,
that
the
product
not
be
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505
that
the
case
has
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
what
congress
thought
was
covered
by
an
effective
application
under
section
505.
the
second
consideration
that
we
think
militates
in
favor
of
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
on
these
two
products
in
general,
is
that
the
only
available
evidence
of
congress’s
purpose,
in
amending
the
definition
of
new
drug
in
the
first
place,
shows
a
very
limited
purpose.
remember,
the
grandfather
provision
controls
the
applicability
of
the
amendment
to
that
section
201
(p)
definition
of
a
new
drug.
so
we
believe
that's
relevant
to
inquire
what
was
congress’s
purpose
in
amending
the
definition.
the
government
has
stated
in
its
brief
that
they
agree
that
there
is
only
a
limited
evidence
of
purpose
in
the
legislative
history
and
that
purpose
was
to
clear
up
some
confusion
that
was
prevalent
in
the
senate
at
the
time
that
the
new
drug
definition
was
amended.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
ensure
that
new
claims
for
our
old
products
would
be
covered
by
the
new
definition.
so
that
if
aspirin
would
have
been
newly
recommended
for
acne,
for
example;
to
give
examples
when
you
used
here
this
morning,
then
a
new
drug
application
would
have
to
be
filed
for
aspirin
insofar
as
it
was
being
recommended
for
the
new
use,
that
was
the
purpose.
that
was
the
only
purpose
that
is
evidenced
in
the
legislative
history
and
we
think
that
because
'me-too'
products
obviously
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
purpose
that
the
statute
should
not
be
distorted
so
as
to
deny
these
products,
the
grandfather
status,
which
congress
literally
and
explicitly
conferred
on
them.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
prefer
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
i
will
try
not
to
use
them
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
being
grateful
for
the
expansion
of
the
time.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
mr.
frey
has
said
quite
correctly
that
section
107
(c)
(4),
page
482,
refers
to
a
drug
rather
than
to
a
product,
but
that
doesn't
advance
ball
any
in
our
opinion.
he
says
that,
201
(p)
is
generic
and
therefore
107
(c)
(4)
must
be
generic.
but
again
he
stressed,
that
as
the
government
did
in
its
brief,
it
just
ignores
the
fact
that
in
carving
out
an
exemption
from
the
applicability
of
the
amended
definition
which
is
generic,
congress
made
that
exemption
turn
on
a
highly
personal
and
particularized
factor,
namely
was
the
drug,
now
mr.
frey
said
in
the
statute
where
it
was
the
drug
covered
by
ineffective
application.
now
if
mr.
frey
is
right
and
a
drug
is
covered
by
an
effective
application
and
if
any
member
of
its
generic
class
is
covered
then
once
the
first
nda
is
approved,
nobody
else
need
to
file
a
new
drug
application
because
section
505
(a),
the
basic
statutory
requirement
and
this
is
on
page
477,
505
(a)
says,
“no
person
shall
introduce
or
deliver
any
new
drug
unless
an
approval
of
an
application
filed
pursuant
to
sub-section
(b)
is
effective
with
respect
to
such
drug.”
now
if
the
word
drug
is
generic
than
its
generic.
if
it's
personal,
it's
personal.
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
that
what
makes
the
201
(p)
definition
generic
is
the
rather
awkward
phrasing,
that
a
new
drug
is
any
drug,
the
composition
of
which
is
such
that
it
is
not
generally
recognized
by
experts.
now
that's
not
found
anywhere
in
the
statute.
107,
except
201
(p),
the
grandfather
clause
doesn't
say
that
a
product
is
disqualified
from
grandfather
status.
if
it's
a
product,
the
composition
of
which
is
such
that
is
covered
by
a
new
application,
and
so
we
therefore
rest
on
the
proposition
that
congress
enacted
a
statute.
mr.
frey
is
not
testifying
before
a
legislative
committee.
he
is
here
before
this
court
asking
it
to
interpret
what
congress
wrote.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
we
think,
there
are
not
regulatory
schemes
that
are
precisely
like
this,
in
the
respect
to
which
your
honor
refers.
i
am
not
a
securities
lawyer.
my
understanding,
however
is
that,
for
example,
if
a
person
violates
the
securities
act,
by
failing
to
comply
with
registration
requirements,
and
like
the
principal
remedy,
and
i
am
just
not
certain
if
it's
the
only
one,
but
the
principal
remedies
inaction
in
the
district
courts,
and
the
action
i
might
add,
need
not
be
criminal.
the
government
has
civil
remedies
available.
it
can
cease
the
products,
it
can
enjoin
with
the
civil
burden
of
preponderance
of
evidence
burden.
and
as
far
as
the
necessity
of
bringing
thousands
of
suits
is
concerned,
we
think
the
history
of
the
regulatory
statute
in
question
shows
that
where
a
point
is
established,
if
it
has
relevance
to
other
cases,
it
need
not
be
litigated
thousands
of
times.
mr.
joel
e.
hoffman
i
do
have
an
answer,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
i
may
state
just
briefly.
the
congress
continued
in
courts
usually
as
to
the
products
that
were
on
market
in
1962.
whatever
regulatory
scheme
was
then
in
courts
as
to
that
product,
if
a
product
was
being
regulated,
as
a
new
drug,
and
actively
regulated,
then
it
would
continue
to
be
so
regulative
under
the
amended
schemes.
if
it
wasn't
being
regulated
under
the
administrative
new
drug
scheme,
which
is
traditional
to
'me-too',
that
it
continued
not
to
be.
now
this
may
be
seen
as
unfair
and
the
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
association
have
suggested
that
in
fact
anti-aid
products,
which
would
become
no
longer
in
use,
are
not
subject
to
the
amended
definition
of
new
drug
either.
that
issue
is
present
in
our
case,
with
a
refinement.
we
are
in
position
of
--
as
the
district
court
found
having
withdrawn
the
applications
from
fda,
but
that
is
an
entirely
a
separate
issue,
which
they
simply
haven't
been
timed
to
discuss.
we
think
in
other
words
this
is
not
anomalous
anymore
than
any
grandfather
clause
is
anomalous,
that
distinguishes
between
products
in
various
regulatory
statuses
when
statute
is
amended,
but
if
there
is
an
anomaly;
it's
for
congress,
and
not
for
this
court
to
adjudicate.
