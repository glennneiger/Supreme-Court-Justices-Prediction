justice
potter
stewart
would
you
just
state
again
what
the
louisiana
law
generally
was
at
that
time
by?
there’s
a
reservation
and
it’s
a
reservation
of
a
not
much
more
than
easement
i
guess,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
right
to--
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
exists
a
reservation
period,
that’s
good.
that
is
extinguished
by
non-use
after
the
passage
of
10
years.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
i
am
just
talking
about
louisiana
law.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
could
the
parties
by
contract
extend
that
period
beyond
ten
years?
justice
potter
stewart
they
could
contract
the
period
but
they
couldn’t
extend
it.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
begins
to
rise
again
from
each
use?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
louisiana
law
at
the
time
of
these
conveyances.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
very
interesting
reason
for
it
that
it’s
spelled
out
somewhere
here
on
these
briefs.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
very
eye
of
the
louisiana
law,
it
was
thought
that
before
that
amendment
it
was
difficult
for
the
united
states
to
acquire
land
for
this
kind
of
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
point
then
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
leiter
minerals
that
told
the
federal
courts
to
abstain,
refrain
until
they
got
a--until
it’s
clear
in
the
indiana
and
the
louisiana
supreme
court
what
the
louisiana
law
was.
the
louisiana
law
was
wholly
irrelevant
in
any
circumstance,
what
was
the
whole
point
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
opinion
for
the
court
in
leiter
minerals
which
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
must
say
it’s
quite
[voice
overlap]
that
i
never
know
the
answer
to
maybe.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
federal
law
is
going
to
be
controlling,
what
possible
relevance
could
the
louisiana
law
have
had
and
therefore
what
possible
purpose
could
the
court’s
decision
in
leiter
minerals
have
been
designed
to
perform?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
this
is
before
you
get
to
constitutional
questions;
you
just
say
that
federal
law
applies.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
then
you
tell
us
that
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that,
we
don’t
have
to
reach
any
constitutional
questions.
but
if
that
is
true,
then
what
was
the
point
of
the
court’s
opinion
in
leiter
minerals?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
briefed
and
argued,
i
suppose,
was
it
not?
i
was
--
just
as
before
i
was
on
the
court
but
i’d
assume
that
it
was
full-dress
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
are
you
telling
right
now,
the
reversionary
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
case,
specifically
in
the
expectancy
of
the
government
that
by
non-use
the
mineral
right
would
be
extinguished,
that’s
what
are
you
talking
about,
that
expectancy?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government’s
expectancy
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you’re
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
talking
about
my
expectancy?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you’re
talking
about
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
expectancy.
justice
potter
stewart
again,
we’re
talking
about
the
possibility
of
the
mineral
rights
being
extinguished
by
prescription,
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
is
louisiana
unique
among
the
states?
is
the
law
of
louisiana
unique
among
the
states
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
holding
that
there
cannot
be
any
property
right
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
minerals
as
such?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
no
other
--
none
of
the
other
states
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
have
borrowed
the
civil
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think,
it
should
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
your
reference
to
what
page
of
what
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
the
summary
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
is
contained
i
think
in
the
excerpts
from
the
opinion
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
of
the
leiter
case
which
appear
on
pages
37
and
38
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
united
states
as
to
canada,
what's
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
the
basic
point
that
your
making
is
wholly
contradicted
by
the
yazell
case?
that
federal
law
controls
it,
that’s
your
point
and
this
contract
was
written
this
--
when
in
reflecting
the
louisiana
law,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
new
landowner
--
the
new
landowner
has
the
same
expectancy
as
to
renounce
to,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
because
he
is
now
the
landowner.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
owns
a
land,
he
owns
the
minerals
under
the
land.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
