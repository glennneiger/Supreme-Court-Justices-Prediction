harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
lewis.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
this
a
characteristic
of
the
civil
law
generally?
well,
there
isn’t
a
civilian
up
here
on
the
bench.
so,
i
ask
these
rather
basic
questions.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
this
is
true
in
france
and
other
places
with
the
civil
law
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
gather
mr.
reynolds,
even
if
we
don’t
agree
with
this
act,
even
if
we
doubted
you.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
second
argument
is
that
under
the
property
clause
in
any
event,
it
say
whatever
you
got
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
whatever
it
may
be
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it’s
subject
to
the
property
clause.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
to
that
extent
its
federal
law,
whatever
it
may
be.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
i
gather.
do
you
have
a
third
argument
that
--
i
gather,
do
you
want
the
contact
clause
or
the
due
process
clause
at
any
event
the
statute
limited
on
act
application
of
315
at
least
in
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
united
states?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
with
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
that
is
our
fourth
argument
that
in
any
event,
the
application
by
315,
only
the
lands
acquired
by
the
united
states?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
what’s
your
view
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
insofar
as
it
is
currently
applicable
and
prospectively
applicable,
than
applicable
to
your
contemporaneous
acquisitions
of
land
in
louisiana
under
this
act?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
not
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
its
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
unless
you’ve,
except
that
your
basic
argument,
i
suppose
that
federal
law
and
its
applicable,
and
i
gather
from
your
argument
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
also
gather
from
previous
opinions
of
this
court
that
that’s
just
the
way
of
saying
that
law
is
anything
the
government
wants
it
to
be
in
a
particular
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
against
the
contem

blackmun

the
contemporaneous
validity
of
the
