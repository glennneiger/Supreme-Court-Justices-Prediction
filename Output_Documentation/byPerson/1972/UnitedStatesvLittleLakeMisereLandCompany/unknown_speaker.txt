unknown
speaker
it
wasn’t
decided
which
law
controls,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
answer
of
the
heart
of
the
argument
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
so
clear,
the
state
wouldn’t
be
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds,
what
if
the
united
states
owns
some
bonds
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
do
you
say
that
the
rights
under
those
bonds
are
determined
strictly
by
federal
law
and
that
even
though
louisiana
were
to
make
particular
interpretation
that
apply
to
all
bondholders,
the
united
states
wouldn’t
be
bound
by
it?
unknown
speaker
a
bond
is
a
contract
too,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds
--
unknown
speaker
well,
you
--
just
to
go
back,
would
you
agree
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
acquired
under
the
deed
originally,
the
reservation
was
to
be
measured
by
louisiana
law?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
united
states
get
this
property?
unknown
speaker
with
the
reservation
in
it
for
10
years
of
the
minerals?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
interest
in
the
properties
of
the
united
states
acquired
at
that
time,
under
that
deed
was
to
be
measured
by
the
louisiana
law.
unknown
speaker
if
under
louisiana
law
at
that
time,
future
interest
were
subject
to
modification
under
state
law,
the
united
states
interest,
future
interest
was
subject
to
the
same
state
power,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
if
you’d
agree
generally
to
the
[voice
overlap].
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
say
that
what
you
acquired
is
this
property
interest?
however,
it’s
determined
that
under
louisiana
law,
that
it
couldn’t
be
modified
or
taken
away
except
in
pursuant
to
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
federal
law
governs
a
disposition
of
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
united
states
property
clause?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lewis,
you
said
that
this
interest,
whatever
it
may
be
cannot
be
sole,
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
according
to
the
louisiana
statute?
unknown
speaker
louisiana
supreme
court
decisions.
unknown
speaker
and
the
way,
it’s
regardless
to
what
the
contract
says
or
you
just
can’t
sell
it,
of
course
you
can’t
separate
it?
unknown
speaker
could
you
stop.
how
do
you
(inaudible)
united
states?
the
interest
that
you
took
a
deed?
unknown
speaker
yes,
this
is
property
and
you
are
saying
the
federal
law
would
govern
what
is
it
you
acquired
under
that
deed?
that’s
what
you
have
said.
unknown
speaker
you
talked
about
yesterday.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
argue
that?
what's
the
authority
you
say
when
the
united
states
acquires
mineral
property
in
a
state
that
the
land
is
actually
is
the
meaning
of
it
as
determined
by
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
as
if
the
general
company
it’s
like
the
united
states
was
issuing
the
deed
itself?
unknown
speaker
if
the
united
states
have
issued
a
deed,
the
real
property
that
it
owns?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
yazell
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
a
little
different
point
you
just
made?
unknown
speaker
but
no
you
didn’t
--
unknown
speaker
for
whatever
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
know
about
the
authority
was
for
to
justice
stewart.
what's
the
authority
for
some
case
would
that
--
what's
the
authority
for
saying
that
you
look
the
federal
law
to
the
service?
what
is
that
you
acquire
to
that
deed?
unknown
speaker
[voice

yazell?
unknown

it
wasn’t
decided
which
