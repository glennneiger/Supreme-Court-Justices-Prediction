chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-1459,
united
states
against
little
lake
land
company.
mr.
reynolds,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
your
position
that
that
statute
can
speak
only
as
of
the
future
after
1940?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
conceivable
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
conceivable
mr.
reynolds
that
the
court
sent
this
back
because
of
some
of
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
louisiana
law
that
might
not
be
true
as
to
the
other
49
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
federal
question
at
all.
it
got
no
statutory
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
that
result
conceivably
have
disposed
of
the
matter
without
any
problems
of
federal
law
coming
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
about
applying
state
law
as
it
was
in
1939,
1937
and
1939?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
lapse
of
the
10
years,
then
you
say
they
would’ve
vested.
of
course,
the
united
states
government
wanting
to
keep
it
for
birds
but
granted
leases
to
oil
exploration
companies,
they
could
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
for
some
purposes,
the
louisiana
law
does
recognize
that
kind
of
a
radius
mistake?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
pick
up
there
in
the
morning,
mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
71-1459.
mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
will
come
later
to
the
question
whether
that
can
override
the
local
louisiana
law,
on
this
subject
can
override
an
explicit
contract
made
between
the
state
and
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
of
those
cases
mr.
lewis
engulfed
contracts
between
two
sovereigns,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lewis,
to
just
to
take
into
account
your
time,
the
court
will
extend
your
time
about
five
minutes
in
order
to
give
you
time
to
develop
this
contract
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
couldn’t
that
have
been
accomplished
just
as
well
as
it
had
been
made
effective
as
to
all
future
transactions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
isn’t
an
interest
in
realty
as
you
suggest,
then
why
doesn’t
the
contract
clause
govern?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’ve
argued
strongly
and
very
cogently
that
this
contract
be
it
no
interest
in
realty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
then,
let’s
say
it’s
just
a
contract,
a
contract
between
two
parties
in
this
case
between
united
states
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
a
vested
right
in
terms
of
realty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
of
course,
i
suppose
that’s
for
the
contract
clause
ultimately,
isn’t
it.
i
assume
sir;
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
for
the
--
under
your
theory
of
the
case
at
any
future
time,
can
louisiana
go
in
and
begin
drilling
operations
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
respondents,
i
must
say,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
that
might
have
some
impairment
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
united
states
government
acquired
it
under
the
migratory
game
verdict,
cout
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
found
that
it
wouldn’t
impair
it
if
it
were
a
10-year
limitation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
land
company
can
drill
for
the
next
100
years
if
they
want
to
go,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
lewis.
mr.
reynolds
we’ll
extend
your
time
five
or
six
minutes
if
you
think
you
need
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
the
blaisdell
case,
the
equity
of
redemption
under
the
mortgage
foreclosure
law
was
a
matter
of
state
statute
giving
one
year
for
redemption
as
i
recall
it
and
the
mortgage
moratorium
act
was
in
effect
an
extension
of
that
one
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
it
wasn’t
just
a
purely
a
matter
of
contract.
it
was
a
matter
of
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
contract
that
had
been
made
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
light
of
that
statute
but
i'm
simply
suggesting
it
wasn’t
purely
a
matter
of
contract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
contract
plus
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
you
have
here
i
presumed,
you
have
contract
plus
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
subsequently
inactive
in
both
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
difference
is
that
in
blaisdell
case,
the
contract
has
been
made
with
reference
to
in
a
pre-existing
statute.
here,
it
was
a
subsequent
statute
only.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
yazell
case,
you
had
before
and
after.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
reynolds.
thank
you
mr.
lewis.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief

warren
e.

we’ll
