about

justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume,
there’s
been
a
general
statute
in
louisiana
not
maybe
in
just
the
united
states
but
just
announcing
a
general
rule
of
non-prescriptibility
to
applying
to
everybody.
would
it
have
applied
to
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn’t
it
apply
to
everybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
but
how
--
what
was
the
reason
for
limiting
it
to
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
certainly
has
an
impact
on
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
no
other
parties,
no
other
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
law?
can
you
just
pick
out
united
states
to
apply
this
rule
to
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
vested
right
period,
your
honor.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
at
the
time
of
united
states
acquired
whatever
interest
it
did
acquire
if
any.
the
case
law
in
louisiana
was
contrary
to
what
you
say,
it
is
not
and
it
is
clearly
so.
and
then
has
the
united
states
acquire
its
interest
the
case
law
in
louisiana
change
some
typical
--
they
overruled
prior
decisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
it
is
the
same
as
--
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
what
it
really
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
case
hinges
on
whether
at
the
time
united
states
required
what
i
meant
is
that
acquired,
the
law
of
louisiana
clearly
was
that
whoever
acquires
that
interest
would
have
known
that
if
it
was
subject
--
whatever
it
read
like
--
whatever
it
read
in
the
contract,
it
was
subject
to
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
--
by
the
legislature
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
like
united
states
in
the
deed
that
it
took.
if
in
that
deed
it
took,
it
said,
here
you’ll
have
me
set
minerals
in
10
years,
unless
the
legislature
passes
the
law
that
says,
you
will
get
them
in
30
years.
that’s
a
situation
you're
putting
in
the
legislature
before
the
10
years
is
over
passes
the
law
that
says
you're
interest
is
suppose
to
come
for
30
years
or
its
terminate.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
doesn’t
that
have
to
appear
clearly
from
the
louisiana
law
that
whatever
the
united
states
acquired
when
it
took
its
deed,
that
interest
is
subject
to
modification
by
a
change
of
the
law.
justice
byron

you
do
not
claim
that
the
louisiana
law
at
that
time
made
it
clear
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
justice
byron

white
and
the
law
is
that

in

case

what
