mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
action
was
instituted
by
the
united
states
to
acquire
its
title
to
lands
in
the
state
of
louisiana
which
it
had
acquired
some
years
ago
by
deed
and
condemnation
for
use
as
a
wildlife
refuge.
the
relevant
events
leading
to
commencement
of
this
lawsuit
can
be
briefly
summarized.
in
1916,
the
united
states
and
great
britain
ratified
a
treaty
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
many
species
of
birds
that
customarily
migrate
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
between
canada
and
united
states.
among
the
several
protections
enumerated
in
the
treaty
was
the
establishment
of
wildlife
refuges
both
here
and
in
canada.
in
1929,
congress
in
furtherance
of
a
national
program
for
the
protection
of
wildlife
enacted
the
migratory
bird
conservation
act,
implementing
in
part
the
treaty
between
this
country
and
great
britain.
the
act
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
19
to
23
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
among
other
things
to
acquire
lands
deemed
valuable
for
wildlife
refuges
upon
attaining
the
consent
of
the
state
in
which
the
acreage
is
located.
pursuant
to
this
authority,
the
united
states
in
1937
entered
in
the
contract
negotiations
with
little
lake
misere
land
company
for
the
purchase
of
some
10,048
acres
of
undeveloped
marshland
located
in
the
state
of
louisiana
to
form
a
park
of
the
lacassine
wildlife
refuge.
on
july
23,
1937,
the
united
states
acquired
this
acreage
from
lake
misere
by
deed
of
purchase.
the
deed
contained
a
reservation
clause
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
of
page
25,
pertaining
to
“all
the
oil,
gas,
sulphur,
and
other
minerals
in,
on,
and,
under
the
land.”
by
its
terms,
it
reserved
to
lake
misere,
and
again
i
quote,
“the
right
of
investigating,
exploring,
prospecting,
drilling,
and
mining
for
and
producing
the
said
oil,
gas,
sulphur,
and
other
minerals”
for
a
period
of
ten
years
from
the
date
of
the
deed.
it
further
provided
that
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period,
the
company,
if
it
was
then
conducting
drilling
operations
or
actually
producing
minerals
could
continue
to
do
so
until
it
seized
drilling
for
60
consecutive
days
or
until
its
mineral
production
seized.
the
united
states
and
lake
misere
agreed
in
addition
that
if
lake
misere
was
not
conducting
mining
operations
on
the
land
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period
of
reservation,
“the
right
to
mine,
produce
and
market
the
said
oil,
gas,
sulphur,
and
other
minerals
shall
terminate
and
the
complete
fee
title
to
said
land
shall
thereby
become
vested
in
the
united
states.”
the
united
states
agreed
to
pay
an
excess
of
$40,000
for
the
acreage.
approximately
two
years
later,
it
obtained
for
the
refuge
an
additional
2,574
acres
of
marshlands
from
lake
misere
in
the
same
area
by
a
condemnation
judgment
entered
in
1939.
the
united
states
paid
an
excess
of
$12,000
compensation.
the
condemnation
judgment
contained
a
10-year
reservation
provision
that
was
in
all
material
respects,
identical
to
the
one
that
the
parties
have
included
in
the
earlier
deed
of
purchase.
both
conveyances
also
provided
that
the
united
states
would
receive
from
lake
misere
royalty
payments
from
minerals
removed
from
the
government
lands
during
the
period
of
reservation.
now,
at
the
time
that
these
conveyances
were
negotiated
and
entered
into,
it
is
agreed
that
the
laws
of
louisiana
recognized
mineral
reservation
of
the
sort
just
described
as
providing
for
what
was
called
a
period
of
contractual
prescription.
the
word
prescription
refers
essentially
to
non-use
or
inactivity
and
has
the
legal
effect
of
cutting
off
an
existing
interest
or
servitude
for
the
failure
to
exercise
it.
the
servitude
in
essence
lapses
for
non-use
or
in
more
technical
terms,
terminates
by
force
of
prescription.
under
the
louisiana
civil
code,
the
period
of
non-use
cannot
extend
beyond
10
years
but
any
period
up
to
and
including
10
years
may
be
designated
by
contract.
in
1937
and
1939,
when
these
conveyances
were
completed,
there
was
no
restriction
under
louisiana
law
on
the
right
of
the
united
states
or
anyone
else
to
agree
to
a
period
of
contractual
prescription.
a
mineral
deed,
a
mineral
reservation
and
a
deed
of
purchase
that
was
by
its
terms
to
terminate
in
time
because
of
non-use
was
as
enforceable
under
louisiana
law
by
the
united
states
if
no
mining
had
occurred
as
by
any
private
party
to
a
land
contract
and
that
was
the
clear
understanding
of
the
united
states
and
lake
misere
at
the
time
that
they
agreed
to
the
land
transactions
involved
here
and
bargained
for
the
reservation
of
a
mineral
servitude
for
a
period
of
10
years.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
is
an
easement
or
servitude.
it
is
a
right
to
go
on
the
property.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
after
--
by
the
terms
of
the
conveyance
here
after
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
after
that,
it
could
not
extend
beyond
10
years
of
non-use.
a
statutory
prescription
under
louisiana
law
would
cut
off
the
right
to
go
on
the
land
at
the
end
of
10
years
of
non-use.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
parties
cannot
contract
for
a
period
longer
than
10
years
of
non-use.
they
can
contract
for
any
period
up
to
and
including
10
years.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
it.
but
they
could
not
extend
the
period
of
non-use.
if
there
was
use
during
that
10-year
period,
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--
then
you
would
have
an
additional
10
years
from
the
time
of
use.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
under
louisiana
law.
[voice
overlap]
but
they
cannot
contract
for
a
period
longer
than
a
10-year
period
of
non-use
under
the
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
[voice
overlap]
--
and
it
was
the
understanding
of
the
parties
at
the
time
that
they
entered
into
these
conveyances
and
negotiated
them.
now,
thereafter,
the
state
of
louisiana
enacted
new
legislation
with
respect
to
prescriptive
rights.
it
was
applicable
not
to
all
land
acquisitions
in
the
state
but
only
to
those
acquisitions
made
by
the
united
states
and
this
new
legislation
eliminated
for
the
most
part
the
termination
of
mineral
servitudes
by
force
of
prescription
under
conveyances
of
the
united
states.
the
statute,
louisiana
act
315,
was
passed
in
1940.
it
set
forth
in
relevant
part
in
our
main
brief
at
pages
3
and
4
and
it
reads
as
follows,
“when
land
is
acquired
by
conventional
deed
or
contract,
condemnation
or
expropriation
proceedings
by
the
united
states
of
america
or
any
of
its
subdivisions
or
agencies,
from
any
person,
firm
or
corporation
and
by
the
act
of
acquisition,
order
or
judgment,
oil,
gas,
or
other
minerals
or
royalties
are
reserved.
the
rights
so
reserved
shall
be
imprescriptible.”
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
this
statute,
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
there
was
an
earlier
statute
in
1938
where
louisiana
treated
its
own
state
agencies
with
respect
to
statutory
prescription
in
the
same
manner
as
the
united
states
and
said
that
the
prescriptive
period
shall
not
run
with
respect
to
the
statutory
prescription
provisions
of
the
statute,
of
louisiana
law.
but
under
this
statute,
which
the
louisiana
supreme
court
construed
in
the
leiter
minerals
case
to
pertain
not
only
to
statutory
prescription
but
to
contractual
prescription,
that
is
the
contracted
period
of
non-use.
this
covered
only
the
united
states
and
was
directed
only
at
the
united
states.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
the
reason,
one
of
the
reasons
for
it
was
to
make
it
easier
for
the
united
states
to
acquire
lands
in
louisiana
by
being
able
to
offer
a
perpetual
servitude
to
their
vendors
if
they
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
--
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
our
position,
your
honor.
that
it
can
only
be
given
prospective
application
and
cannot
be
replied
retroactively
to
cut
off
existing
interest
in
the
minerals
that
the
united
states
acquired
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
legislation.
the
louisiana
court
in
construing
the
statute,
as
i
indicated,
declared
that
it
was
applicable
both
to
statutory
and
contractual
prescription
but
there
is
one
exception
with
respect
to
contractual
prescription.
if
the
contract
specified
as
servitude
for
a
term
of
definite
duration
as
opposed
to
one
of
indefinite
or
uncertain
duration,
then
the
act
was
inapplicable.
but
in
all
other
respects,
it
was
held
to
be
applicable
and
the
louisiana
court
said
that
it
could
be
applied
retroactively
with
respect
to
all
passed
acquisitions
of
the
united
states
where
the
prescriptive
period
had
not
run
as
of
the
date
of
enactment.
and
this
litigation
arose
because
of
lake
misere’s
claim
that
the
agreed
terms
of
the
reservation
in
the
deed
of
purchase
and
the
condemnation
judgment
were
rendered
inoperative
by
the
subsequently
enacted
imprescriptible
legislation.
there’s
no
dispute
here
that
lake
misere
was
not
conducting
any
mining
operations
on
the
bird
refuge
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period
and
that
it
had
not
either
before
or
after
the
agreed
cut
off
dates
conducted
any
such
mining
activity.
the
federal
district
court
felt
itself
bound
by
the
earlier
two-to-one
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
leiter
minerals
case
and
held
louisiana
315
of
1940
to
be
applicable
to
the
mineral
reservations
in
this
earlier
1937
and
1939
conveyances.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
leiter
minerals.
initially,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
mineral
servitudes
in
these
conveyances
were
of
indefinite
duration
so
as
to
be
imprescriptible
under
louisiana
act
315
even
assuming
that
act’s
application
here.
our
reasons
are
discussed
in
detail
in
our
main
brief
on
that
point.
but
if
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
in
that
respect,
an
application
of
louisiana
act
315
to
cut
off
the
prescriptive
rights
of
the
united
states
that
have
been
bargained
for,
validly
agreed
to,
and
purchased
prior
to
enactment
of
the
legislation
would
we
submit
violates
several
provisions
of
the
constitution.
it
would
abrogate
expressed
terms
of
the
reservation
in
these
conveyances
as
they
were
understood
by
the
parties
at
the
time
that
the
transaction
were
entered
into
and
thus
would
impair,
the
obligations
of
contracts
in
violation
of
article
1,
section
10
of
the
constitution.
more
particularly
and
with
specific
reference
to
the
fact
that
we
deal
here
with
land
acquisitions
by
the
united
states,
an
application
of
315
--
act
315,
would
contravene
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution
which
vest
the
power
in
congress
to
dispose
of
and
regulate
property
belonging
to
the
united
states.
since
the
landmark
decision
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
it’s
been
a
basic
principle
of
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
that
the
affirmative
grants
of
legislative
power
in
the
constitution
are
to
be
broadly
construed.
and
consistently,
this
court
has
held
that
the
article
4
power
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
regulation
and
disposition
of
federal
property
is
exclusive
and
unlimited.
it
does
works
for
congress
and
congress
alone
to
legislate
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
the
valuable
mineral
interest
that
the
united
states
had
acquired
under
these
conveyances.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
the
whole
point
was
to
determine.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
don’t
presume
to
know
the
answer
but
i
would
imagine
that
the
point
would
be
to
determine
what
the
louisiana,
the
highest
court
in
louisiana,
would
put
construction.
it
would
put
on
the
statute
whether
it
would,
for
example
say
that
the
statute
applies
merely
to
statutory
prescription
or
apply
solely
prospectively
in
which
case
no
constitutional
questions
such
as
we
have
presented
here
would
need
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
the
issues
in
leiter
minerals
were
the
same
as
the
issues
raised
here
and
i
believe
that
they
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
is
reluctant
to
reach
out
and
decide
constitutional
questions
that
aren’t
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
that
the
court
had
gone
--
has
considered
the
case
yet
as
fully
as
to
determine
what
the
various
considerations
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
just
--
i
think
the
federal
law
controls.
i
don’t
know
why
it
was
sent
back.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
it
was
not
decided
which
law
controls.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i’m
sure
that
had
something
to
do
with
them
and
i
think
that
if
they
have
gotten
an
interpretation
from
the
louisiana
court,
that
would’ve
applied,
the
statute
only
prospectively
and
what
--
or
what
it
said
it
applied
only
to
statutory
prescription
then
you
would
not
even
have
the
issue
that
we
have
here
with
respect
to
whether
federal
law
or
state
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
i
believe
it
was
sent
back
to
determine
what
the
construction
would
be
by
the
louisiana
court.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
contract
that
the
united
states
entered
into
for
the
acquisition
of
property
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
--
if
you
go
down
a
lot
turns,
if
the
united
states
goes
down
into
louisiana
and
it
says
that
it
agrees
that
it’s
going
to
rely
on
louisiana
law
with
respect
to
determinations
of
these
sorts
then
i
think
that
the
louisiana
law
might
well
be
applicable.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
is
we
contracted
louisiana
and
gave
a
reservation
which
under
the
existing
law
in
louisiana
only
gave
a
servitude
for
a
period
of
time,
and
that
contract
did
not
contemplate
the
change
in
the
louisiana
law
to
cut
off
the
rights
that
we
had
agreed
to.
i
think
that’s
a
different
situation.
what
we
got
here
was
a
future
interest
in
the
minerals
beneath
the
surface
of
the
property
and
that
future
interest
is
no
less
property
belonging
to
the
united
states
under
article
4
than
was
the
yet
to
be
produced
to
electric
energy
and
as
one
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority
which
also
is
to
be
obtained
in
the
future
from
lands
and
in
that
case
property
of
the
united
states,
or
water
owned
by
the
united
states.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
louisiana
law,
all
that
the
reservation
gives
is
a
servitude
to
go
upon
the
government’s
property
to
explore
for
and
extract
the
minerals.
the
minerals
themselves
are
part
of
the
realty
and
therefore
the
united
states
thus
have
more
than
a
hope
for
expectancy
as
a
real
interest
at
the
time
that
it
acquires
that
realty.
but
i
think
that
whatever
the
technical
characterization
of
this
interest,
i
think
that
under
general
federal
law
principles
that
it’s
a
future
interest
that
certainly
is
a
vested
interest
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
at
the
termination
of
the
10-year
period.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
property
interest
belonging
to
the
united
states.
what
louisiana
has
done
by
its
subsequently
inactive
legislation
is
transfer
that
future
interest
to
somebody
else.
it’s
dispose
of
or
made
a
disposition
of
that
federal
property
of
the
government.
the
government
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
for
acquired
lands
can
lease
a
future
interest
in
mineral
deposits
under
its
lands
and
the
disposition
of
that
future
interest
in
mineral
deposits
is
now
by
the
state’s
statute
if
applied
retroactively
taken
away
from
the
government
and
we
don’t
think
that
that
is
a
--
w
e
think
whatever
the
technical
characterization
under
louisiana
law,
that
we
have
a
property
interest
here
of
the
government’s
that
is
only
for
disposition
by
the
government
under
article
4.
i
think,
in
addition
to
that,
that
the
reservation
in
the
conveyances
that
these
parties
agreed
to,
contemplated
that
the
government
would
have
this
interest
in
the
future
and
that
the
10-year
mineral
servitude
would
be
prescriptible.
under
the
contracts
clause,
we
think
that
what
a
retroactive
application
of
louisiana
act
315
does
is
abrogate
the
expressed
terms
of
the
reservation
and
that
is
an
impairment
of
the
obligation
of
contracts.
the
united
states
acquired
--
the
united
states
agreed
that
lake
misere
could
retain
the
right
for
a
period
of
10
years
to
come
on
that
land
and
explore
for
and
extract
minerals
but
lake
misere
had
an
obligation
under
the
reservations
to
be
actively
engaged
in
mining
those
lands
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period
or
its
right,
its
servitude
would
not
be
renewed.
it
would
terminate
and
it
could
no
longer
come
on
the
land.
at
that
time,
whatever
interest
it
had
reverted
to
the
united
states.
louisiana
act
315
releases
lake
misere
this
obligation
to
be
actively
engaged
in
mining
the
lands
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period
and
it
extends
indefinitely
the
servitude.
thereby
depriving
the
united
states
of
its
future
interest
in
the
minerals
that
have
been
bargained
for,
validly
agreed
to
under
the
existing
law,
and
purchased
by
the
united
states
prior
to
enactment
of
the
legislation.
and
we
don’t
believe
any
of
the
alleged
purposes
for
this
louisiana
legislation
justify
such
an
impairment
for
the
obligation
of
contracts.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
reservation
was
to
be?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
acquired
it
by
a
deed
of
purchase
and
by
condemnation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
that’s
the
nature
of
the
interest.
that’s
right.
that
the
term
and
reversionary
right,
i
don’t
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
future
interest
weren’t
subject
to
modification
under
the
louisiana
law
at
that
time.
this
is
different
than
if
we
had
in
contract
to
be
bound
by
the
statutory
prescription
period.
i
think
in
that
situation,
we
then
would’ve
agreed
to
be
bound
by
whatever
changes
there
are
in
the
prescription,
statutory
prescription
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
but
here,
we
entered
into
a
contract
for
specific
terms.
we
didn’t
agree
to
any
modification.
we
said
that
the
reservation
would
be
for
this
period
and
if
there’s
no
mining
at
the
end
of
this
period,
it
would
terminate
and
the
title
would
vest
in
the
united
states.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
the
property
clause.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
state
that
while
we
believe
the
determination
here
with
respect
to
what
the
interest
was
that
the
united
states
acquired
under
these
conveyances,
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
took
a
deed
to
acquire
property
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
our
position,
your
honor.
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
i
said
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
are
brief
--
in
our
brief
we've
explain
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
uphold
the
proposition
that
when
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
the
contract
that
the
interest
that
the
united
states
acquires
under
that
contract
as
a
party
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
state
law.
and
we
believe
that
this
is
a
contract
where
the
united
states
is
a
party
and
entered
into
and
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
to
determine
what
interests
the
united
states
did
acquire.
now,
we
further
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
federal
laws
to
the
interest
but
the
--
if
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
a
contract
and
into
--
with
the
private
party
then
the
interest
that
the
united
states
obtains
under
that
contract
is
a
matter
of
federal
--
for
federal
law
as
oppose
to
state
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
the
yazell
case,
i
think
is
considerably
different.
it’s
a
quite
a
unique
situation
and
there
the
united
states
went
down
into
texas
it
bargained
and
negotiated
the
contract
on
a
basis
of
the
texas
law.
it
was
everybody’s
understanding
that
the
existing
law
in
texas
at
that
time
were
controlled.
and
after
the
fact,
the
united
states
turned
around
and
said
texas
law
was
not
going
to
apply.
now,
here
what
we’re
talking
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor
let
me
see
if
i
can
state
it
this
way.
if
--
when
we
went
into
louisiana,
if
you
look
to
louisiana
to
see
what
interest
were
acquired.
i
think
that
the
louisiana
supports
law,
supports
the
proposition
that
the
united
states
when
it
acquired
the
property
here,
acquired
a
paramount
interest
to
the
minerals
under
the
land
that
the
only
one
who
--
in
louisiana
who
can
grant
a
servitude
but
it
only
goes
to
the
use
of
the
minerals.
only
goes
to
exploration
for
the
minerals.
the
only
way
louisiana
can
do
that
is
the
landowner.
he
has
the
paramount
interest
in
those
minerals.
those
minerals
are
not
a
separate
estate
they
are
part
of
the
property
and
while
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law
and
while
the
counsel
for
lake
misere
stated
that
that
the
reversionary
interest
which
is
again
the
use
that
comes
to
the
united
states
the
end.
well,
that
cannot
be
sold
separately.
that
can
be
sold
along
with
the
sale
of
the
land.
if
i
sell
the
land,
if
the
united
states
sells
a
land
then
the
reversionary
interest
is
sold.
now,
we
believe
that
those
interests
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
he
has
the
--
when
it
terminates,
he
has
--
the
use
reverts
to
him,
the
exclusive
use
to
explore
for
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
because
he
is
the
landowner.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
now,
those
--
that’s
right.
and
the
united
states
here
own
the
land.
now,
the
bundle
of
interests
or
the
bundle
of
rights
that
the
united
states
got,
if
you
want
to
look
to
louisiana
law,
are
as
we
--
as
i
stated
are
the
property
rights,
the
inseparable
estate
in
the
minerals
and
the
reversionary
interest
to
exclusive
use
to
explore
for
it.
now,
whether
that
bundle
of
rights
is
property
under
article
4
is
a
federal
law
question.
and
whether
the
government
that
the
--
whether
that
can
be
disposed
off
is
a
matter
for
congress.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
i
still
submit
that
we
take
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
as
to
what
interests
were
acquired.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
what
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
the
allegheny
county
has
authority
for
that
your
honor
as
one
decision.
i
also
think
that
ivanhoe
irrigation
district
v.
mccracken
is
another
authority
for
that
the
decisions
by
this
court.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
yazell
was
a
special
situation.
i
think
that
the
thing
that
bothered
the
court
about
yazell
was
that
the
government
was
trying
to
remake
on
agreement
with
respect
to
existing
law
that
they
been
relying
on.
here,
the
government
--
even
if
you
want
to
look
to
the
louisiana
law,
the
existing
louisiana
law,
the
government
is
trying
to
assert
the
interest
that
it
acquired
under
the
existing
law.
and
in
yazell
we
had
a
different
situation
where
the
government
had
gone
in
and
negotiated
the
particular
rights
under
the
state
law
and
then
it
tried
to
say,
we’ll
now
we
are
not
going
to
look
to
state
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right
and
we
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it’s
subject
to
the
property
clause.
whatever
label
the
state
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
application
of
--
or
you
mean
contract
clause
argument?
that
the
application
of
315
applied
retroactively
does
abrogate
the
expressed
terms
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
of
the
contract?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
believe
that
there
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
argument
there
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
we
also
assert
that
we
don’t
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
state
laws.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
in
fact
that
supports
the
proposition
that
we’re
making
here.
there,
the
court
emphasize
that
the
state
was
acting
in
a
particular
a
special
emergency
with
respect
to
housing
shortages.
that
in
meeting
this
emergency,
the
statute
was
a
limited
one
addressed
to
the
particular
emergency
that
the
extension
of
the
sale’s
rights
after
the
foreclosure
and
the
special
exemption
given
under
that
missouri’s
statute
was
a
very
limited
one
only
for
a
period
of
time.
and
they
went
and
look
at
the
purposes
behind
the
statute
to
see
whether
or
not
in
that
particular
situation
you
could
impair
the
obligation
of
--
it
was
permissible
to
impair
the
obligation
to
contract.
now
in
this
case,
there
are
no
reasons
comparable
to
what
we
had
in
the
blaisdell
to
want
a
retroactive
application
of
louisiana
act
315
to
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts.
one
of
the
principle
reasons
of
the
statute
as
we've
been
told
this
morning
was
purely
perspective
to
make
it
easier
for
the
united
states
to
acquire
lands
in
louisiana
in
the
future
and
what
we’re
talking
about
here
is
retroactive
application
to
cutoff
the
interests
that
are
already
have
been
acquired
which
certainly
doesn’t
further
the
prospective
purpose.
so,
i
don’t
think
that
we
have
any
of
the
circumstances
that
we
are
involved
in
blaisdell
which
the
court
said
because
of
those
special
unique
service
that
it
was
permissible
in
that
instance
to
impair
the
obligation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
we
are
not
challenging
the
perspective
application
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
that
the
certainly
a
good
number
of
the
arguments
we
are
making
here
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--
be
inapplicable
with
respect
to
perspective
applications
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--
that
they’re
address
to
the
retroactive
applications.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
on
a
perspective
law,
i
think
that
a
federal
law
controls
that
we
that
some
of
the
arguments
we
make
it
could
be
asserted.
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
again,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right
but
i
think
there
that’s
much
closer
to
yazell
and
i
believe
that
we
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
time
in
that
circumstance.
because
the
state
of
louisiana
has
there
declared
that
these
contractual
prescriptions
are
imprescriptible
by
statute.
when
we’re
going
down
in
louisiana
and
we
would
be
--
we
would
know
that
the
existing
law
of
the
state
at
that
time
declared
it.
and
i
think
that
that’s
a
much
more
comparable
situation
to
what
you
had
in
yazell
where
the
government
would
go
in
and
it
would
enter
into
the
contract
on
the
basis
of
that
law
and
then,
try
to
get
out
from
under
later.
i
don’t
think
we
have
that
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
of
that
one
year.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
--
it
was
statute
but
the
--
there
was
a
question
of
whether
you
could
--
whether
the
statute,
the
operation
of
the
statute
would.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
purely.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
plus
statute.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
we
have
a
subsequently
inactive
statute
that
the
--
i
guess
it
would
be
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
the
statute
there
was
directed,
i
think
it’s
a
very
definite
emergency
situations
that
just
aren’t
present
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
here,
that’s
correct.
if
there
no
further
questions
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i've
already
used
more
than
my
allotted
time.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
action
was
instituted
by
the
united
states
to
acquire
its
title
to
lands
in
the
state
of
louisiana
which
it
had
acquired
some
years
ago
by
deed
and
condemnation
for
use
as
a
wildlife
refuge.
the
relevant
events
leading
to
commencement
of
this
lawsuit
can
be
briefly
summarized.
in
1916,
the
united
states
and
great
britain
ratified
a
treaty
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
many
species
of
birds
that
customarily
migrate
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
between
canada
and
united
states.
among
the
several
protections
enumerated
in
the
treaty
was
the
establishment
of
wildlife
refuges
both
here
and
in
canada.
in
1929,
congress
in
furtherance
of
a
national
program
for
the
protection
of
wildlife
enacted
the
migratory
bird
conservation
act,
implementing
in
part
the
treaty
between
this
country
and
great
britain.
the
act
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
19
to
23
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
among
other
things
to
acquire
lands
deemed
valuable
for
wildlife
refuges
upon
attaining
the
consent
of
the
state
in
which
the
acreage
is
located.
pursuant
to
this
authority,
the
united
states
in
1937
entered
in
the
contract
negotiations
with
little
lake
misere
land
company
for
the
purchase
of
some
10,048
acres
of
undeveloped
marshland
located
in
the
state
of
louisiana
to
form
a
park
of
the
lacassine
wildlife
refuge.
on
july
23,
1937,
the
united
states
acquired
this
acreage
from
lake
misere
by
deed
of
purchase.
the
deed
contained
a
reservation
clause
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
of
page
25,
pertaining
to
“all
the
oil,
gas,
sulphur,
and
other
minerals
in,
on,
and,
under
the
land.”
by
its
terms,
it
reserved
to
lake
misere,
and
again

of

and

for
a
period
of
ten
years
from
the
date
of
the
deed.
it
further
provided
that
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period,
the
company,
if
it
was
then
conducting
drilling
operations
or
actually
producing
minerals
could
continue
to
do
so
until
it
seized

for
60
consecutive
days
or
until
its
mineral
production
seized.
the
united
states
and
lake
misere
agreed
in
addition
that
if
lake
misere
was
not
conducting
mining
operations
on
the
land
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period
of
reservation,
“the

and
the

shall
thereby
become
vested
in
the
united
states.”
the
united
states
agreed
to
pay
an
excess
of
$40,000
for
the
acreage.
approximately
two
years
later,
it
obtained
for
the
refuge
an
additional
2,574
acres
of
marshlands
from
lake
misere
in
the
same
area
by
a
condemnation
judgment
entered
in
1939.
the
united
states
paid
an
excess
of
$12,000
compensation.
the
condemnation
judgment
contained
a
10-year
reservation
provision
that
was
in
all
material
respects,
identical
to
the
one
that
the
parties
have
included
in
the
earlier
deed
of
purchase.
both
conveyances
also
provided
that
the
united
states
would
receive
from
lake
misere
royalty
payments
from
minerals
removed
from
the
government
lands
during
the
period
of
reservation.
now,
at
the
time
that
these
conveyances
were
negotiated
and
entered
into,
it
is
agreed
that
the
laws
of
louisiana
recognized
mineral
reservation
of
the
sort
just
described
as
providing
for
what
was
called
a
period
of
contractual
prescription.
the
word
prescription
refers
essentially
to
non-use
or
inactivity
and
has
the
legal
effect
of
cutting
off
an
existing
interest
or
servitude
for
the
failure
to
exercise
it.
the
servitude
in
essence
lapses
for
non-use
or
in
more
technical
terms,
terminates
by
force
of
prescription.
under
the
louisiana
civil
code,
the
period
of
non-use
cannot
extend
beyond
10
years
but
any
period
up
to
and
including
10
years
may
be
designated
by
contract.
in
1937
and
1939,
when
these
conveyances
were
completed,
there
was
no
restriction
under
louisiana
law
on
the
right
of
the
united
states
or
anyone
else
to
agree
to
a
period
of
contractual
prescription.
a
mineral
deed,
a
mineral
reservation
and
a
deed
of
purchase
that
was
by
its
terms
to
terminate
in
time
because
of
non-use
was
as
enforceable
under
louisiana
law
by
the
united
states
if
no
mining
had
occurred
as
by
any
private
party
to
a
land
contract
and
that
was
the
clear
understanding
of
the
united
states
and
lake
misere
at
the
time
that
they
agreed
to
the
land
transactions
involved
here
and
bargained
for
the
reservation
of
a
mineral
servitude
for
a
period
of
10
years.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
is
an
easement
or
servitude.
it
is
a
right
to
go
on
the
property.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
after
--
by
the
terms
of
the
conveyance
here
after
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
after
that,
it
could
not
extend
beyond
10
years
of
non-use.
a
statutory
prescription
under
louisiana
law
would
cut
off
the
right
to
go
on
the
land
at
the
end
of
10
years
of
non-use.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
parties
cannot
contract
for
a
period
longer
than
10
years
of
non-use.
they
can
contract
for
any
period
up
to
and
including
10
years.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
it.
but
they
could
not
extend
the
period
of
non-use.
if
there
was
use
during
that
10-year
period,
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--
then
you
would
have
an
additional
10
years
from
the
time
of
use.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
under
louisiana
law.
[voice

but
they
cannot
contract
for
a
period
longer
than
a
10-year
period
of
non-use
under
the
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
[voice
overlap]
--
and
it
was
the
understanding
of
the
parties
at
the
time
that
they
entered
into
these
conveyances
and
negotiated
them.
now,
thereafter,
the
state
of
louisiana
enacted
new
legislation
with
respect
to
prescriptive
rights.
it
was
applicable
not
to
all
land
acquisitions
in
the
state
but
only
to
those
acquisitions
made
by
the
united
states
and
this
new
legislation
eliminated
for
the
most
part
the
termination
of
mineral
servitudes
by
force
of
prescription
under
conveyances
of
the
united
states.
the
statute,
louisiana
act
315,
was
passed
in
1940.
it
set
forth
in
relevant
part
in
our
main
brief
at
pages
3
and
4
and
it
reads
as
follows,
“when
land
is
acquired
by
conventional
deed
or
contract,
condemnation
or
expropriation
proceedings
by
the
united
states
of
america
or
any
of
its
subdivisions
or
agencies,
from
any
person,
firm
or
corporation
and
by
the
act
of
acquisition,
order
or
judgment,
oil,
gas,
or
other
minerals
or
royalties
are
reserved.
the
rights
so
reserved
shall
be
imprescriptible.”
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
this
statute,
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
there
was
an
earlier
statute
in
1938
where
louisiana
treated
its
own
state
agencies
with
respect
to
statutory
prescription
in
the
same
manner
as
the
united
states
and
said
that
the
prescriptive
period
shall
not
run
with
respect
to
the
statutory
prescription
provisions
of
the
statute,
of
louisiana
law.
but
under
this
statute,
which
the
louisiana
supreme
court
construed
in
the
leiter
minerals
case
to
pertain
not
only
to
statutory
prescription
but
to
contractual
prescription,
that
is
the
contracted
period
of
non-use.
this
covered
only
the
united
states
and
was
directed
only
at
the
united
states.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
the
reason,
one
of
the
reasons
for
it
was
to
make
it
easier
for
the
united
states
to
acquire
lands
in
louisiana
by
being
able
to
offer
a
perpetual
servitude
to
their
vendors
if
they
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
--
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
our
position,
your
honor.
that
it
can
only
be
given
prospective
application
and
cannot
be
replied
retroactively
to
cut
off
existing
interest
in
the
minerals
that
the
united
states
acquired
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
legislation.
the
louisiana
court
in
construing
the
statute,
as
i
indicated,
declared
that
it
was
applicable
both
to
statutory
and
contractual
prescription
but
there
is
one
exception
with
respect
to
contractual
prescription.
if
the
contract
specified
as
servitude
for
a
term
of
definite
duration
as
opposed
to
one
of
indefinite
or
uncertain
duration,
then
the
act
was
inapplicable.
but
in
all
other
respects,
it
was
held
to
be
applicable
and
the
louisiana
court
said
that
it
could
be
applied
retroactively
with
respect
to
all
passed
acquisitions
of
the
united
states
where
the
prescriptive
period
had
not
run
as
of
the
date
of
enactment.
and
this
litigation
arose
because
of
lake
misere’s
claim
that
the
agreed
terms
of
the
reservation
in
the
deed
of
purchase
and
the
condemnation
judgment
were
rendered
inoperative
by
the
subsequently
enacted
imprescriptible
legislation.
there’s
no
dispute
here
that
lake
misere
was
not
conducting
any
mining
operations
on
the
bird
refuge
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period
and
that
it
had
not
either
before
or
after
the
agreed
cut
off
dates
conducted
any
such
mining
activity.
the
federal
district
court
felt
itself
bound
by
the
earlier
two-to-one
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
leiter
minerals
case
and
held
louisiana
315
of
1940
to
be
applicable
to
the
mineral
reservations
in
this
earlier
1937
and
1939
conveyances.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
leiter
minerals.
initially,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
mineral
servitudes
in
these
conveyances
were
of
indefinite
duration
so
as
to
be
imprescriptible
under
louisiana
act
315
even
assuming
that
act’s
application
here.
our
reasons
are
discussed
in
detail
in
our
main
brief
on
that
point.
but
if
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
in
that
respect,
an
application
of
louisiana
act
315
to
cut
off
the
prescriptive
rights
of
the
united
states
that
have
been
bargained
for,
validly
agreed
to,
and
purchased
prior
to
enactment
of
the
legislation
would
we
submit
violates
several
provisions
of
the
constitution.
it
would
abrogate
expressed
terms
of
the
reservation
in
these
conveyances
as
they
were
understood
by
the
parties
at
the
time
that
the
transaction
were
entered
into
and
thus
would
impair,
the
obligations
of
contracts
in
violation
of
article
1,
section
10
of
the
constitution.
more
particularly
and
with
specific
reference
to
the
fact
that
we
deal
here
with
land
acquisitions
by
the
united
states,
an
application
of
315
--
act
315,
would
contravene
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution
which
vest
the
power
in
congress
to
dispose
of
and
regulate
property
belonging
to
the
united
states.
since
the
landmark
decision
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
it’s
been
a
basic
principle
of
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
that
the
affirmative
grants
of
legislative
power
in
the
constitution
are
to
be
broadly
construed.
and
consistently,
this
court
has
held
that
the
article
4
power
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
regulation
and
disposition
of
federal
property
is
exclusive
and
unlimited.
it
does
works
for
congress
and
congress
alone
to
legislate
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
the
valuable
mineral
interest
that
the
united
states
had
acquired
under
these
conveyances.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
the
whole
point
was
to
determine.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
don’t
presume
to
know
the
answer
but
i
would
imagine
that
the
point
would
be
to
determine
what
the
louisiana,
the
highest
court
in
louisiana,
would
put
construction.
it
would
put
on
the
statute
whether
it
would,
for
example
say
that
the
statute
applies
merely
to
statutory
prescription
or
apply
solely
prospectively
in
which
case
no
constitutional
questions
such
as
we
have
presented
here
would
need
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
the
issues
in
leiter
minerals
were
the
same
as
the
issues
raised
here
and
i
believe
that
they
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
is
reluctant
to
reach
out
and
decide
constitutional
questions
that
aren’t
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
that
the
court
had
gone
--
has
considered
the
case
yet
as
fully
as
to
determine
what
the
various
considerations
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
just
--
i
think
the
federal
law
controls.
i
don’t
know
why
it
was
sent
back.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
it
was
not
decided
which
law
controls.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i’m
sure
that
had
something
to
do
with
them
and
i
think
that
if
they
have
gotten
an
interpretation
from
the
louisiana
court,
that
would’ve
applied,
the
statute
only
prospectively
and
what
--
or
what
it
said
it
applied
only
to
statutory
prescription
then
you
would
not
even
have
the
issue
that
we
have
here
with
respect
to
whether
federal
law
or
state
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
i
believe
it
was
sent
back
to
determine
what
the
construction
would
be
by
the
louisiana
court.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
contract
that
the
united
states
entered
into
for
the
acquisition
of
property
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
--
if
you
go
down
a
lot
turns,
if
the
united
states
goes
down
into
louisiana
and
it
says
that
it
agrees
that
it’s
going
to
rely
on
louisiana
law
with
respect
to
determinations
of
these
sorts
then
i
think
that
the
louisiana
law
might
well
be
applicable.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
is
we
contracted
louisiana
and
gave
a
reservation
which
under
the
existing
law
in
louisiana
only
gave
a
servitude
for
a
period
of
time,
and
that
contract
did
not
contemplate
the
change
in
the
louisiana
law
to
cut
off
the
rights
that
we
had
agreed
to.
i
think
that’s
a
different
situation.
what
we
got
here
was
a
future
interest
in
the
minerals
beneath
the
surface
of
the
property
and
that
future
interest
is
no
less
property
belonging
to
the
united
states
under
article
4
than
was
the
yet
to
be
produced
to
electric
energy
and
as
one
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority
which
also
is
to
be
obtained
in
the
future
from
lands
and
in
that
case
property
of
the
united
states,
or
water
owned
by
the
united
states.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
louisiana
law,
all
that
the
reservation
gives
is
a
servitude
to
go
upon
the
government’s
property
to
explore
for
and
extract
the
minerals.
the
minerals
themselves
are
part
of
the
realty
and
therefore
the
united
states
thus
have
more
than
a
hope
for
expectancy
as
a
real
interest
at
the
time
that
it
acquires
that
realty.
but
i
think
that
whatever
the
technical
characterization
of
this
interest,
i
think
that
under
general
federal
law
principles
that
it’s
a
future
interest
that
certainly
is
a
vested
interest
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
at
the
termination
of
the
10-year
period.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
property
interest
belonging
to
the
united
states.
what
louisiana
has
done
by
its
subsequently
inactive
legislation
is
transfer
that
future
interest
to
somebody
else.
it’s
dispose
of
or
made
a
disposition
of
that
federal
property
of
the
government.
the
government
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
for
acquired
lands
can
lease
a
future
interest
in
mineral
deposits
under
its
lands
and
the
disposition
of
that
future
interest
in
mineral
deposits
is
now
by
the
state’s
statute
if
applied
retroactively
taken
away
from
the
government
and
we
don’t
think
that
that
is
a
--
w
e
think
whatever
the
technical
characterization
under
louisiana
law,
that
we
have
a
property
interest
here
of
the
government’s
that
is
only
for
disposition
by
the
government
under
article
4.
i
think,
in
addition
to
that,
that
the
reservation
in
the
conveyances
that
these
parties
agreed
to,
contemplated
that
the
government
would
have
this
interest
in
the
future
and
that
the
10-year
mineral
servitude
would
be
prescriptible.
under
the
contracts
clause,
we
think
that
what
a
retroactive
application
of
louisiana
act
315
does
is
abrogate
the
expressed
terms
of
the
reservation
and
that
is
an
impairment
of
the
obligation
of
contracts.
the
united
states
acquired
--
the
united
states
agreed
that
lake
misere
could
retain
the
right
for
a
period
of
10
years
to
come
on
that
land
and
explore
for
and
extract
minerals
but
lake
misere
had
an
obligation
under
the
reservations
to
be
actively
engaged
in
mining
those
lands
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period
or
its
right,
its
servitude
would
not
be
renewed.
it
would
terminate
and
it
could
no
longer
come
on
the
land.
at
that
time,
whatever
interest
it
had
reverted
to
the
united
states.
louisiana
act
315
releases
lake
misere
this
obligation
to
be
actively
engaged
in
mining
the
lands
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
period
and
it
extends
indefinitely
the
servitude.
thereby
depriving
the
united
states
of
its
future
interest
in
the
minerals
that
have
been
bargained
for,
validly
agreed
to
under
the
existing
law,
and
purchased
by
the
united
states
prior
to
enactment
of
the
legislation.
and
we
don’t
believe
any
of
the
alleged
purposes
for
this
louisiana
legislation
justify
such
an
impairment
for
the
obligation
of
contracts.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
reservation
was
to
be?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
acquired
it
by
a
deed
of
purchase
and
by
condemnation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
that’s
the
nature
of
the
interest.
that’s
right.
that
the
term
and
reversionary
right,
i
don’t
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
future
interest
weren’t
subject
to
modification
under
the
louisiana
law
at
that
time.
this
is
different
than
if
we
had
in
contract
to
be
bound
by
the
statutory
prescription
period.
i
think
in
that
situation,
we
then
would’ve
agreed
to
be
bound
by
whatever
changes
there
are
in
the
prescription,
statutory
prescription
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
but
here,
we
entered
into
a
contract
for
specific
terms.
we
didn’t
agree
to
any
modification.
we
said
that
the
reservation
would
be
for
this
period
and
if
there’s
no
mining
at
the
end
of
this
period,
it
would
terminate
and
the
title
would
vest
in
the
united
states.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
the
property
clause.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
state
that
while
we
believe
the
determination
here
with
respect
to
what
the
interest
was
that
the
united
states
acquired
under
these
conveyances,
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
took
a
deed
to
acquire
property
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
our
position,
your
honor.
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
i
said
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
are
brief
--
in
our
brief
we've
explain
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
uphold
the
proposition
that
when
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
the
contract
that
the
interest
that
the
united
states
acquires
under
that
contract
as
a
party
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
state
law.
and
we
believe
that
this
is
a
contract
where
the
united
states
is
a
party
and
entered
into
and
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
to
determine
what
interests
the
united
states
did
acquire.
now,
we
further
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
federal
laws
to
the
interest
but
the
--
if
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
a
contract
and
into
--
with
the
private
party
then
the
interest
that
the
united
states
obtains
under
that
contract
is
a
matter
of
federal
--
for
federal
law
as
oppose
to
state
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
the
yazell
case,
i
think
is
considerably
different.
it’s
a
quite
a
unique
situation
and
there
the
united
states
went
down
into
texas
it
bargained
and
negotiated
the
contract
on
a
basis
of
the
texas
law.
it
was
everybody’s
understanding
that
the
existing
law
in
texas
at
that
time
were
controlled.
and
after
the
fact,
the
united
states
turned
around
and
said
texas
law
was
not
going
to
apply.
now,
here
what
we’re
talking
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor
let
me
see
if
i
can
state
it
this
way.
if
--
when
we
went
into
louisiana,
if
you
look
to
louisiana
to
see
what
interest
were
acquired.
i
think
that
the
louisiana
supports
law,
supports
the
proposition
that
the
united
states
when
it
acquired
the
property
here,
acquired
a
paramount
interest
to
the
minerals
under
the
land
that
the
only
one
who
--
in
louisiana
who
can
grant
a
servitude
but
it
only
goes
to
the
use
of
the
minerals.
only
goes
to
exploration
for
the
minerals.
the
only
way
louisiana
can
do
that
is
the
landowner.
he
has
the
paramount
interest
in
those
minerals.
those
minerals
are
not
a
separate
estate
they
are
part
of
the
property
and
while
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law
and
while
the
counsel
for
lake
misere
stated
that
that
the
reversionary
interest
which
is
again
the
use
that
comes
to
the
united
states
the
end.
well,
that
cannot
be
sold
separately.
that
can
be
sold
along
with
the
sale
of
the
land.
if
i
sell
the
land,
if
the
united
states
sells
a
land
then
the
reversionary
interest
is
sold.
now,
we
believe
that
those
interests
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
he
has
the
--
when
it
terminates,
he
has
--
the
use
reverts
to
him,
the
exclusive
use
to
explore
for
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
because
he
is
the
landowner.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
now,
those
--
that’s
right.
and
the
united
states
here
own
the
land.
now,
the
bundle
of
interests
or
the
bundle
of
rights
that
the
united
states
got,
if
you
want
to
look
to
louisiana
law,
are
as
we
--
as
i
stated
are
the
property
rights,
the
inseparable
estate
in
the
minerals
and
the
reversionary
interest
to
exclusive
use
to
explore
for
it.
now,
whether
that
bundle
of
rights
is
property
under
article
4
is
a
federal
law
question.
and
whether
the
government
that
the
--
whether
that
can
be
disposed
off
is
a
matter
for
congress.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
i
still
submit
that
we
take
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
as
to
what
interests
were
acquired.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
what
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
that
the
allegheny
county
has
authority
for
that
your
honor
as
one
decision.
i
also
think
that
ivanhoe
irrigation
district
v.
mccracken
is
another
authority
for
that
the
decisions
by
this
court.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
yazell
was
a
special
situation.
i
think
that
the
thing
that
bothered
the
court
about
yazell
was
that
the
government
was
trying
to
remake
on
agreement
with
respect
to
existing
law
that
they
been
relying
on.
here,
the
government
--
even
if
you
want
to
look
to
the
louisiana
law,
the
existing
louisiana
law,
the
government
is
trying
to
assert
the
interest
that
it
acquired
under
the
existing
law.
and
in
yazell
we
had
a
different
situation
where
the
government
had
gone
in
and
negotiated
the
particular
rights
under
the
state
law
and
then
it
tried
to
say,
we’ll
now
we
are
not
going
to
look
to
state
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right
and
we
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it’s
subject
to
the
property
clause.
whatever
label
the
state
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
application
of
--
or
you
mean
contract
clause
argument?
that
the
application
of
315
applied
retroactively
does
abrogate
the
expressed
terms
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
of
the
contract?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
believe
that
there
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
argument
there
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
we
also
assert
that
we
don’t
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
state
laws.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
in
fact
that
supports
the
proposition
that
we’re
making
here.
there,
the
court
emphasize
that
the
state
was
acting
in
a
particular
a
special
emergency
with
respect
to
housing
shortages.
that
in
meeting
this
emergency,
the
statute
was
a
limited
one
addressed
to
the
particular
emergency
that
the
extension
of
the
sale’s
rights
after
the
foreclosure
and
the
special
exemption
given
under
that
missouri’s
statute
was
a
very
limited
one
only
for
a
period
of
time.
and
they
went
and
look
at
the
purposes
behind
the
statute
to
see
whether
or
not
in
that
particular
situation
you
could
impair
the
obligation
of
--
it
was
permissible
to
impair
the
obligation
to
contract.
now
in
this
case,
there
are
no
reasons
comparable
to
what
we
had
in
the
blaisdell
to
want
a
retroactive
application
of
louisiana
act
315
to
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts.
one
of
the
principle
reasons
of
the
statute
as
we've
been
told
this
morning
was
purely
perspective
to
make
it
easier
for
the
united
states
to
acquire
lands
in
louisiana
in
the
future
and
what
we’re
talking
about
here
is
retroactive
application
to
cutoff
the
interests
that
are
already
have
been
acquired
which
certainly
doesn’t
further
the
prospective
purpose.
so,
i
don’t
think
that
we
have
any
of
the
circumstances
that
we
are
involved
in
blaisdell
which
the
court
said
because
of
those
special
unique
service
that
it
was
permissible
in
that
instance
to
impair
the
obligation.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
we
are
not
challenging
the
perspective
application
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
that
the
certainly
a
good
number
of
the
arguments
we
are
making
here
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--
be
inapplicable
with
respect
to
perspective
applications
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--
that
they’re
address
to
the
retroactive
applications.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
on
a
perspective
law,
i
think
that
a
federal
law
controls
that
we
that
some
of
the
arguments
we
make
it
could
be
asserted.
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
again,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
right
but
i
think
there
that’s
much
closer
to
yazell
and
i
believe
that
we
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
time
in
that
circumstance.
because
the
state
of
louisiana
has
there
declared
that
these
contractual
prescriptions
are
imprescriptible
by
statute.
when
we’re
going
down
in
louisiana
and
we
would
be
--
we
would
know
that
the
existing
law
of
the
state
at
that
time
declared
it.
and
i
think
that
that’s
a
much
more
comparable
situation
to
what
you
had
in
yazell
where
the
government
would
go
in
and
it
would
enter
into
the
contract
on
the
basis
of
that
law
and
then,
try
to
get
out
from
under
later.
i
don’t
think
we
have
that
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
of
that
one
year.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
--
it
was
statute
but
the
--
there
was
a
question
of
whether
you
could
--
whether
the
statute,
the
operation
of
the
statute
would.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
not
purely.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
plus
statute.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
we
have
a
subsequently
inactive
statute
that
the
--
i
guess
it
would
be
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
the
statute
there
was
directed,
i
think
it’s
a
very
definite
emergency
situations
that
just
aren’t
present
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
here,
that’s
correct.
if
there
no
further
questions
i
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i've
already
used
more
than
my
allotted
time.
