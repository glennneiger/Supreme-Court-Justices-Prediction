mr.
austin
w.
lewis
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
i
think
that
this
case
is
somewhat
more
complicated
than
the
average
one
because
i
don’t
believe
the
government
and
respondents
are
together
on
what
issues
are
before
the
court
here
today.
we
consider
on
the
issue
of
question
that
there
are
two
and
only
two
issues
before
the
court.
one
is,
do
these
servitudes
involved
here,
these
mineral
reservations,
do
they
fit
the
definition
established
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
of
a
case
of
contractual
prescription,
so
as
to
make
effect
to
them
act
315
of
1940?
that’s
question
one.
then
if
they
do
in
the
act
did
so
applied
to
them,
then
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think,
there
is
a
reason
to
be
here
before
you
today.
as
so
applied,
do
they
violate
any
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution?
we
think
that
those
are
the
only
two
issues
before
the
court.
and
i
think
to
clarify
that
we
should
go
back
and
get
into
more
detail
about
the
history
of
the
leiter
minerals
litigation.
in
1957,
the
case
was
before
the
court.
a
majority
of
the
court
was
justice
douglas
dissenting
considered
the
act
315
in
1940
and
said
expressly
that
before
we
rule
on
the
constitution
at
nullity
of
that
act,
they
sent
it
back
it
to
the
state
court,
got
an
opinion
on
what
act
was
passed,
what’s
its
effect
and
is
it
constitutional
under
state
law.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
your
honor,
i
can
see
no
reason
at
all
to
have
sent
this
case
back
to
one
meritoriously
back
to
the
courts
and
it
got
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
compromised
into
that
of
leiter
minerals.
had
the
court
at
that
time,
taken
counsel’s
argument
and
said
that
federal
law
and
not
the
louisiana
law
should
apply
this.
it
could
have
been
disposed
of
at
that
hearing
and
then
nothing
else
to
do.
now,
justice
douglas
in
rather
picturesque
language
in
his
dissent
in
that
case
suggested
that
the
court
was
beating
the
devil
around
the
bush
by
not
going
ahead
and
deciding
it.
and
he
said
that
as
i
interpret
his
dissent
not
on
the
question
of
whether
state
law
or
federal
law
should
be
applied
but
that
the
court
was
counting
to
apply
either
one
of
them
without
sending
it
back.
having
just
taken
the
case
away
from
the
state
court
to
begin
with,
and
if
i
may
borrow
justice
douglas’
language,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
would
beat
the
devil
around
the
bush
some
seven
times
since
that
time
if
as
a
result
of
this
hearing
today
state
law
is
going
to
be
ignored
and
federal
law
is
going
to
be
applied.
there
have
been
five,
i
believe,
bigger
decisions
in
the
leiter
case
and
two
in
this
all
based
on
the
applicability
of
the
statute.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
your
honor,
i
would
get
to
that
at
the
moment
but
i’ll
answer
you
briefly
now.
the
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
two
occasions
to
be
retrospective
in
effect
and
to
be
constitutional
as
so
applied.
so,
if
we
are
going
to
take
half
of
louisiana
law,
i
think
we
have
to
take
the
other
half
too
then
testing
it
only
against
the
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
i’ll
deal
with
later.
but
if
the
louisiana
law
is
the
guiding
law
and
i
feel
so
strong
it
is,
then
part
of
that
law
is
that
this
is
a
remedial
right
only,
same
as
the
cause
of
action
and
that
it
can
be
lengthened
or
shortened.
it
has
been
done
both
the
louisiana
court.
it
has
been
shortened
as
well
lengthened
and
upheld
and
both
in
doing
that
and
upheld
as
a
retrospective
law.
now,
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general
that
some
federal
law
should
be
applied
here,
leaving
out
leiter
and
leaving
out
cases
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief,
united
states
versus
fox,
united
states
versus
yazell,
a
more
recent
case,
holding
it
where
isolated
land
transactions
were
involved.
the
law
of
the
situs
state
does
apply
to
the
exclusion
of
any
federal
law.
but
i
asked
myself
during
the
time
of
the
history
of
this
case,
if
the
court
pleases,
if
federal
law
has
to
be
applied,
what
federal
law?
here
we
have
a
complete
similar
concept
we’re
dealing
with
here.
that
mineral
reservation
procured
the
louisiana
and
not
true
with
any
other
49
states.
so,
where
would
we
find
that
federal
law?
in
its
reply
brief
which
i
just
received
over
the
weekend,
the
government
attempts
to
answer
that
on
page
11
and
that
suggests
that
have
no
difficulty
in
fashioning
a
federal
common
law
to
apply
in
these
circumstances
and
then
admittedly
citing
thompson
on
real
property
and
citing
the
common
law
approach
that
the
state
version
is
always
the
vested
interest.
for
my
civil
law
advantage,
if
the
court
pleases,
i
read
that
with
the
sense
of
almost
far.
it’s
just
completely
foreign
to
our
concept.
our
courts
has
squarely
held
that
this
right
or
expectancy
to
obtain
a
reversion
of
these
minerals
is
not
on
state
at
all.
it’s
not
a
property
interest.
it
can
even
be
solved
and
therefore
the
courts
have
held
that
you
can
validly
cut
across
the
limitation
period
or
prescriptive
period
as
running
against
that
servitude
and
that
expectancy
at
the
same
time.
now,
one
mentioned
by
mr.
reynolds
in
his
argument,
their
brief
suggests
that
the
migratory
bird
act
has
some
legal
significance
in
this
case
to
assist
in
the
application
of
federal
law
and
to
bring
into
place
some
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
were
raised.
i
believe
in
the
last
reply
brief,
they’ve
already
receded
from
that
but
we
submit
that
the
statute
did
just
the
obsolete.
while
we
concede
as
some
of
the
attorneys
in
the
case
have
precedingly
did,
that
congress
could
have
preempted
this
field,
just
a
mere
casual
reading
and
that
statute
shows
that
it
did
not.
it
specifically
preserved
the
jurisdiction
rights
of
the
state
and
the
statute
itself.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
[voice
overlap]
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
no,
sir.
louisiana
decision
construe
on
that.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
the
two
supreme
court
decision
right
on
that
cause.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
it’s
just
a
mere
hope
or
expectancy
that
taxes
to
the
land
and
it
follows
the
land.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
the
reversionary
rights,
yes
sir.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
no,
sir.
the
hope
of
getting
the
minerals
back,
yes,
in
other
words
if
in
five
years
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
sold
the
property
but
didn’t
reserve
the
minerals.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
now
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
if
you
could
not
sell
your
hope
of
getting
these
minerals
back,
mr.
justice.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
the
expectancy
rather
than
the
mineral
reserves.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
right.
you
can
of
course
sell
the
servitude
freely.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
true.
if
they
got
the
mineral
with
the
land,
yes
sir,
and
it’s
free
to
be
done
out
there.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
your
honor,
the
matter
is
complicated
only
to
this
extent.
our
courts
have
squarely
held
that
this
property
interest
is
not
a
property
interest,
this
reversionary
right.
it
held
that
it’s
a
mere
hope
or
expectancy
and
it’s
subject
to
retrospective
deed.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i’ll
return
to
that
--
well,
let
me,
the
fifth
circuit
court
in
the
united
states
versus
nebo
oil
company
probably
said
this
is
better
than
i
can
say
it
and
i
quote,
“we
conclude
that
this
so
called
reversionary
interest
is
nothing
more
than
a
mere
expectancy
or
hope
based
upon
an
anticipated
continuous
without
change
with
the
applicable
laws
of
prescription
and
cannot
be
regarded
as
a
vested
right
protected
by
the
constitution.”
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
thank
you.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
indulgence
and
although
it
will
require
some
repetition,
i
would
like
to
devote
my
remaining
time
here
today
to
a
step-by-step
analysis
of
the
four
legal
concepts
that
i
consider
are
applicable
in
this
case.
hoping
that
this
will
place
this
unique
civil
right
--
civil
law
problem
in
proper
perspective
for
the
court.
initially
thought,
i
will
say
in
the
absence
of
additional
questions
from
the
court,
i
will
lay
aside
any
further
discussion
of
the
point
that
state
law
should
be
applied
here
over
in
a
federal
law.
i
believe
this
is
fully
covered
in
the
briefs
and
consider
that
the
leiter
minerals’
opinion
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
other
cases
cited
in
the
respondent’s
brief
removes
us
as
a
serious
issue
in
the
case
and
while
certainly
no
concessions
have
been
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
had
a
feeling
from
the
government’s
reply
brief
and
the
argument
made
yesterday
that
this
does
not
--
will
not
disturb
the
government
too
seriously.
now,
the
four
items
to
be
considered
in
my
opinion
are
these:
first,
a
brief
discussion
of
the
legal
status
of
mineral
servitude
in
the
state
of
louisiana;
second,
a
consideration
of
the
three
types
of
mineral
servitudes
that
exist
in
that
state;
then
third,
the
legal
status
of
a
case
of
contractual
prescription,
which
on
question
is
involved
in
the
present
case;
and
fourth
and
finally,
the
precise
nature
of
the
so-called
reversionary
interests
of
the
united
states
in
a
case
of
contractual
prescription,
and
whether
any
of
the
constitutional
questions
raised
by
the
government
are
applicable
to
this
case.
now,
on
the
first
point,
i
will
not
devote
a
great
deal
of
time
to
the
basic
mineral
servitude.
its
nature
appeared
to
have
been
understood
by
the
court
yesterday.
except,
i
would
like
to
stress
that
in
louisiana,
there
can
be
no
separate
estate
in
minerals.
no
matter
what
form,
the
deed
or
reservation
is
placed
and
what
language
is
used,
only
a
servitude
or
easement
is
created
which
expires
in
10
years,
if
not
exercise
by
drilling.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
it
is;
it
is.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
know
of
no
other
states
that
has
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
--
has
that
rule.
no,
sir.
it
was
based
of
course
in
our
civil
law
concepts
and
no
such
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
am
satisfied
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
we
made
some
rather
serious
research
on
that
which
i
am
having
problem
too.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
just
one
evidence
that
it
is
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
consequence
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
that
it
involves
only
a
remedial
right,
the
prescription
of
limitation
of
10
years,
and
therefore,
can
be
valid
and
modified
by
subsequent
act
of
the
legislature.
that
is
a
precise
following
the
case.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
the
key
issue
in
the
case.
now,
i
will
say
that
this
strict
rule
of
no
separate
estate
and
no
mineral
estate
separate
from
the
fee
has
met
the
test
of
many
ingenious
offers
--
efforts
to
overcome
it.
sales
for
20
years,
sales
in
perpetuity,
probably
the
most
interesting
was
to
the
sale
purporting
to
transfer
the
fee
title
and
the
minerals
to
the
land
below
a
plain
500
feet
below
the
surface.
although
they
were
attempting
to
get
--
avail
both
the
title
and
the
minerals
but
of
course
there
are
those
that
are
simply
servitude
in
disguise.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
concept
that
the
fee
cannot
be
divided
into
separate
estates
has
cause
the
civil
law
in
our
civil
code
to
evolve
a
system
of
charges
and
burdens
upon
the
land.
in
other
words,
the
servitude
takes
the
place
of
a
separate
mineral
estate
but
the
courts
firmly
hold
that
such
a
servitude
does
not
give
the
owner
any
title
to
the
minerals
in
place.
he
simply
possesses
the
right
to
go
on
the
land
and
explore
for
and
reduce
those
minerals
to
his
possession.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
it
is
taken
from
the
french
law.
but
now
while
this
servitude
cannot
be
expanded
or
converted
into
a
separate
estate,
it
can
be
modified
by
contract
in
two
ways.
so
as
a
result,
we
wind
up
in
louisiana
with
three
types
of
servitudes
and
these,
i
might
add,
were
painstakingly
described
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
the
leiter
advisory
opinion.
now,
the
first
of
these
is
a
servitude
for
fix
term
of
five,
eight,
ten
years
with
no
provisions
whatever
for
extending
that
servitude.
now
currently,
this
is
a
vested
property
right
that
the
united
states
in
this
case
would
have
a
servitude
that
been
on
that
category,
because
act
315
could
not
have
impaired
that
right.
the
second
is
the
ordinary
statutory
servitude
previously
discussed
which
expires
in
10
years
unless
exercised
by
the
drilling
of
a
well
and
obtaining
a
production.
the
third
and
the
one
that’s
under
consideration
here
is
a
servitude
subject
to
contractual
prescription.
now,
there
are
two
and
only
two
requirements
to
establish
such
as
a
servitude:
one
is
that
when
it
is
originally
established,
it
must
be
of
uncertain
or
indefinite
duration;
and
second,
it
must
provide
for
its
conditional
extinguishment
in
some
way.
now,
adjacent
to
that
that
is
the
fact
that
the
servitude
in
this
case
mentioned
a
period
of
10
years
does
not
in
anyway
to
track
from
it
being
a
case
of
contractual
servitude.
actually
the
law
of
louisiana
does
that
and
had
the
period
not
been
mentioned.
we
consider,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
this
category
squarely
fits
the
servitudes
in
the
present
case.
they
provide
that
if
they
were
not
exercised
by
drilling
they
would
expire
in
10
years.
of
course,
whether
or
not
there
would
be
drilling
10
years
later,
clearly
it
was
uncertain
and
indefinite
event.
it
could
not
be
foreseen
at
the
time.
and
of
course
as
i
said,
that’s
simply
a
re-expression
of
louisiana
law,
because
the
servitude
could
not
last
for
more
than
10
years.
and
of
course,
it
also
clearly
provided
for
its
conditional
extinguishment
if
a
well
is
not
drilled
on
or
before
the
end
of
the
10-year
period.
now
the
only
the
departure
of
these
servitudes
from
the
statutory
type
is
the
effect
of
the
use
of
the
servitude
by
the
drilling
of
a
well.
a
well,
not
completed
as
a
producer
under
these
servitudes,
would
not
extend
the
servitude
for
full
period
of
10
years
as
would
be
the
case
and
statutory
interpretation,
by
the
contract
it
would
only
extend
it
for
90
days.
if
they
got
production
of
course
it
would
lasts
as
long
as
production
lasts.
but
we
submit,
if
the
court
pleases,
this
limitation
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
designation
and
the
classification
of
the
initial
servitude
as
being
one
of
contractual
prescription.
that
depends
entirely
on
the
terms
relating
to
the
10-year
period
and
the
method
by
which
it
could
be
extended
or
extinguished
at
the
end
of
that
10-year
period.
i
think
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
pages
12
and
13
of
the
respondent’s
brief,
you
will
find
quotations
from
the
supreme
court’s
advisory
opinion
on
leiter
that
say
that's
better
than
i
can
say
it.
for
example,
the
last
paragraph
on
page
12
says
this,
“most
mineral
servitudes
are
not
established
for
a
fix
time.
a
servitude
of
indefinite
duration
is
extinguished
only
when
it
is
not
exercised
for
a
period
of
10
years,
precisely
our
case.
such
a
servitude,
created
by
mineral
reservation
and
the
sale
to
the
government,
would
under
act
315
of
1940
be
rendered
imprescriptible
and
would
never
be
lost
by
prescription
provided
it
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
1940
act
went
into
effect.”
now,
the
second
quote
on
page
13,
“nevertheless
contracting
parties
are
at
liberty
to
establish
a
contractual
period
of
prescription
for
the
conditional
extinguishment
of
the
servitude
through
non-use
provided
that
the
period
is
10
years
or
less.”
again,
precisely
our
case.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
feel
also
greatly
(inaudible)
in
our
assertion
that
this
is
a
case
of
contractual
servitude
by
the
decisions
of
the
two
courts
below.
in
the
district
court,
a
train
louisiana
jurist
said
this
of
the
servitudes,
“clearly
these
servitudes
present
cases
of
contractual
prescription.”
in
the
fifth
circuit
with
the
panel
containing
one
of
our
most
distinguished
louisiana
jurists,
the
court
quoted
that
language
of
approval
and
said,
and
of
course
as
a
result
to
that
act
315
makes
imprescriptible
this
servitude.
so,
i
think
when
these
louisiana
juries
reach
as
a
conclusion
without
any
problem
whatever,
it
is
for
some
benefit
to
our
contention
that
we
do
have
cases
of
contractual
prescription.
now,
we
now
turn
to
what
the
legal
status
of
the
case
of
contractual
prescription
is.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
squarely
that
it
is
identical
with
that
of
the
statutory
prescription.
therefore,
the
court
in
that
connection
to
page
30
of
our
brief
where
this
was
said
by
the
court,
speaking
of
act
315
of
1940,
“the
act
grows
no
distinction
between
statutory
and
contractual
prescription
and
as
we
view
the
matter
from
the
history
of
the
act,
and
the
objects,
and
purposes
for
which
it
was
adopted,
it
is
manifest
that
the
legislature
intended
the
act
to
be
applicable
to
prescription
whether
established
by
statute
or
by
contract.
for
prescription
had
not
already
accrued
at
the
time
that
the
act
became
effective.”
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
repeated
argument
of
the
government,
it
is
over
and
above
act
315,
because
it
has
a
contract
seems
to
ask
to
beg
the
question
entirely.
the
question
is,
“what
did
that
contract
do?”
and
under
the
supreme
court
resolution
to
this
thing,
it
clearly
established
the
case
of
contractual
prescription.
the
brief
of
the
government
acknowledges
that
the
law
of
contractual
prescription
was
in
existence
when
the
servitudes
were
purchased.
the
government
is
bound
to
know
the
law,
it
was
charged
with
knowing
the
law,
and
certainly
it
was
aware
of
the
rule
that
if
a
contractual
prescription
was
established,
then
it
could
be
modified
either
lengthened
or
shortened
as
prescription
applicable
to
it
by
subsequent
legislative
act.
now,
this
brings
us
to
the
final
and
decisive
issue
in
the
case
in
our
view.
with
a
clear
case
of
contractual
prescription
bringing
to
vow
the
legal
principles
of
applying
to
statutory
prescription,
what
were
the
legal
rights
of
united
states
with
respect
to
its
so-called
reversionary
interests
when
act
315
of
1940
was
adopted?
again,
the
state
law
is
crystal
clear
on
his
point.
holding
that
since
only
a
law
prescription
of
limitation
is
involved.
this
law
goes
only
to
matters
of
remedy
and
does
not
form
a
part
of
the
contract
itself.
and
that
therefore,
the
period
of
prescription
maybe
shortened
or
lengthened
without
impairing
the
obligations
of
the
contract.
this,
of
course,
is
because
no
vested
rights
were
involved.
in
fact,
we
have
a
specific
decision
of
our
louisiana
supreme
court
cited
on
page
35
of
our
brief
where
act
315
was
applied
retrospectively
to
a
reservation
of
mineral
rights
and
a
sale
to
the
united
states
and
was
held
to
be
constitutional
under
state
constitution.
now,
the
ground
on
all
of
this,
if
your
honor
please,
is
quite
fundamental.
it
simply
is
based
on
the
recognition
that
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
stewart
yesterday
that
the
reversionary
interests
is
not
a
vested
right
at
all,
but
it
is
merely
an
inchoate
hope
or
expectancy
based
on
the
laws
of
prescription
or
limitation
which
could
be
changed
for
by
legslative
act.
and
i
repeat
again
my
statement
yesterday,
there
is
no
resemblance
whatever
between
this
so-called
reversionary
interests.
it
really
should
be
called
a
hope
or
expectancy
and
the
common
law
state
in
reversion.
there
is
simply
no
legal
resemblance
at
all.
now,
this
court
has
also
refute
to
recognize
that
for
a
statute
of
limitation
are
involved
which
exist
when
a
contract
is
executed,
do
not
form
a
part
of
that
contract.
and
therefore,
they
may
be
modified
or
even
abrogated
with
respect
to
a
pre-existing
contract
of
constitution.
this
case
is
cited
on
page
32
of
our
brief.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
in
its
reply
brief
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
don’t
think
they
are,
your
honor.
let’s
see.
no,
they
all
seem
to
be
ogden
versus
saunders,
campbell
versus
holt,
jeff
o’brien
versus
williams.
no,
sir
it
could
not
be.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
received
by
me
only
over
the
weekend.
in
spite
of
those
in
reference
to
mr.
reynolds’
part
of
pace
in
the
ad.
they
apparently
recognized
a
probability
with
application
of
louisiana
law
and
they
attempt
to
analyze
their
rights
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
under
these
contracts.
that
is
done
on
pages
2,
3,
and
4
of
their
brief.
now,
i
must
mention
that
i
am
somewhat
troubled
over
the
use
on
page
3
of
the
brief
of
the
old
louisiana
decision
of
federal
land
bank
versus
mulhern
and
a
quotation
from
that
case
which
indicates
that
some
of
the
principles
i
just
announced
here
may
not
be
correct.
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
that
concept
was
retracted
by
the
supreme
court
in
this
very
case
on
rehearing
and
it’s
never
been
repeated
since.
it
simply
has
no
place
in
our
law.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
page
2
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
government.
on
page
3,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
of
the
government,
yes
sir,
about
federal
land
bank
versus
mulhern.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
no,
i
said
in
mulhern
case
on
rehearing.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
retracted,
it
was
not
this
particularly;
it
was
retracted
and
said
we’re
going
back
to
the
common
law
concept
which,
i
mean
the
civil
law
concept
which
i
just
described.
now
as
i
said,
the
government
now
is
offering
to
the
court
its
analysis
to
the
law
of
louisiana
and
that
is
found
in
the
first
complete
paragraph
on
page
4
of
the
reply
brief
and
it
says
this,
“consequently,
once
the
conveyance
is
involved
in
the
present
case
were
consummated,
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
its
undisputed
ownership
of
the
surface
rights
in
the
land
in
question
had
a
paramount
interest
in
the
minerals
below
the
surface
subject
only
to
the
limited
servitude
stipulated
in
the
reservations.”
now
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
lay
aside
beside
with
that
conclusion.
this
quotation
from
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
in
the
leiter
minerals
advisory
opinion
and
i
quote,
“in
this
case,
when
property
is
conveyed
and
the
mineral
rights
are
reserved,
the
party
reserving
the
minerals
is
vested
with
a
real
right,
the
right
to
go
up
on
the
land
and
produce
the
minerals.
in
such
a
case,
the
purchase
of
the
land
subject
to
this
servitude
does
not
acquire
the
mineral
rights.
as
to
the
minerals,
all
the
purchaser
has
acquired
is
the
expectancy
or
hope
that
the
mineral
servitude
will
be
extinguished
by
the
10-year
prescription
of
non-use,
and
will
not
be
extended
or
continued
by
use
beyond
this
period,
for
the
minerals
had
been
reserved,
the
purchase
of
the
land
pays
nothing
for
them
and
has
no
vested
right
in
them.”
then
quoting
from
a
prior
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
tennant
versus
russell,
the
court
says
this,
“a
right
is
vested
when
the
right
to
enjoinment,
present
or
prospective
has
become
the
property
of
some
particular
person
or
persons
as
a
present
interest.
the
right
must
be
absolute,
complete,
and
unconditional
independent
of
a
contingency,
and
a
mere
expectancy
of
future
benefit.
or
a
contingent
interest
in
property
does
not
constitute
a
vested
right.”
so
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
if
this
concept
of
the
louisiana
law
is
accepted
by
this
court
and
applied.
we
think
that
all
of
the
constitutional
issues
raised
by
the
united
states
contract,
property,
supremacy
are
dissolve
in
thin
air
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
any
vested
interest
in
this
so-called
reversionary
interest
of
the
government.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
thank
you
very
much.
now
the
reservation,
if
your
honor
please,
is
found
on
page
180
of
the
addendum
of
our
brief.
there
are
two
of
them
but
they
are
identical
with
mr.
reynolds’
notice
yesterday
and
that
starts
off
by
simply
making
the
normal
reservation
that
would
be
involved
in
the
statutory
prescription.
reserving
the
right
to
drill
for
and
to
produce
into
lay
pipe
lines
and
do
all
the
necessary
incidental
things
which
rights
will
remain
enforced
for
a
period
10
years
from
the
date
of
vesting
title
in
united
states.
and
as
long
thereafter
as
oil,
gas,
sulfur,
or
some
other
minerals
produced
in
the
land
or
so
long
thereafter
as
grantor
shall
conduct
drilling
or
reworking
operations
thereon
with
no
cessation
of
more
than
60
consecutive
days
until
production
results.
if
production
results,
of
course
it
remains
in
effect
indefinite.
now,
this
language,
your
honor,
the
paragraph
i
just
read,
is
identical
with
the
law
of
statutory
prescription
with
the
same
exemption
that
i
noted
earlier,
that
the
drilling
operations
must
be
conducted
as
60-day
intervals
to
maintain
the
servitude,
if
they
do
not
result
in
production.
otherwise,
this
is
a
straight
tracking
of
the
louisiana
law.
and
provided
further,
if
in
the
said
ten-year
period
of
reservation,
if
not
extended
as
here
above
provided
or
the
termination
of
any
extended
period,
the
operation
has
not
been
that
carried
on
the
right
to
provide
and
so
forth,
shall
terminate
and
complete
fee
title
so
thereby
it
become
vested
in
united
states.
then,
i
think
there
is
an
important
royalty
provision.
if
your
honor
please,
this
simply
is
saying
that
if
this
conditional
extinguishment
and
it
is
fairly
conditional
because
it
depends
on
the
will
of
the
servitude
on
as
to
whether
you
drill
or
not
drill
occurs,
then
of
course
the
mineral
right
is
terminated.
that
of
course
would
be
true
in
the
case
of
statutory
prescription.
so,
we
say
that
it's
a
single
exception
your
honor,
of
the
limitation
just
place
on
the
drilling
that
there’s
no
difference
between
this
contract
reservation
and
one
that
would
be
made
under
the
law
of
louisiana.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
your
honor,
if
i
am
not
sure
you
got
my
time
too
much
that
is
a
question
i
was
dying
to
get
into.
the
history
of
the
saying
is
that
this
act
was
passed
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states.
if
--
i
didn’t
cite
it
in
my
brief
but
if
the
court
will
refer
to
the
original
opinion
of
the
district
court
in
the
united
states
versus
nebo
oil
co.,
you
will
find
the
complete
history
of
why
it
was
adopted.
united
states
was
the
largest
purchaser
of
lands
in
louisiana.
it
was
having
increase
in
trouble
buying
lands
because
the
people
did
not
want
to
sell
and
have
their
mineral
rights
possibly
terminated
in
10
years,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
in
order
to
facilitate
its
purchase
of
the
land
in
louisiana,
this
act
was
adopted.
now,
it’s
a
valid
reason
too
because
louisiana
is
an
oil
rich
state.
it’s
almost
impossible
to
purchase
lands
at
any
price
if
the
minerals
are
not
reserve
in
tracks
of
in
sizeable
size.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
assume
it
could
have,
your
honor,
but
there
we
are
adverting
then
to
the
question
of,
what
was
the
right,
the
reversionary
right
gained
by
the
united
states.
that
did
not
so
when
they
get
them
as
apply
retrospectively.
but
again,
we
are
just
at
the
point
of
that
reversionary
interest
of
the
united
states
was
such
an
interest
that
could
be
cut
across
by
intervening
statute.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
that
is
right
that
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that
is
correct.
i
might
add
too
in
fact,
to
answer
the
question
that
louisiana
runs
in
the
same
problems
and
not
too
long
after
this
statute
was
adopted,
they
adopted
an
identical
statute
making
the
same
imprescriptibility
rule
with
respect
to
all
purchases
made
by
any
agency
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
right.
exactly.
so
we
have
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
private
parties,
no.
the
only
rule
as
to
private
parties
is
that
prescription
does
not
run
against
the
matter
and
prescription
is
extended
as
the
court
made
rule
thereon.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
assume
so
the
government
would
be
purchasing
this
property
in
proprietor
capacity.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
because
the
statute
is
limited
to
united
states.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
think
your
honor,
and
this
nebo
discussion
will
bear
this
out,
i
believe.
it
was
applied
because
united
states
was
having
a
serious
problem
in
its
land
acquisitions
in
louisiana,
and
it
was
applied
for
as
benefit
not
as
a
case
of
hostile
discrimination
as
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
it
certainly
does,
but
now
where
that
impact
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
for
that
outweighs
the
benefit
the
united
states
gain
by
its
future
acquisitions
is
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
we
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
first
of
all
we
don’t
think
united
states
is
a
person;
second
and
this
is
the
basic
concept
that
i
am
doing
my
outmost
to
get
across,
whether
it
was
wisely
done
or
equitably
done,
it
did
not
deprive
the
united
states
in
this
case
of
contractual
prescription
of
any
vested
contract
right.
now,
if
it
had
no
right
to
assert,
we
just
don’t
think
any
of
the
constitutional
issues
come
into
play.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
am
not
sure,
i
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
correct.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
but
the
contract
whether
there’s
an
interest
in
realty
or
just
an
interest,
the
contract
clause
in
nominal
pain
only
applies
if
you
have
some
vested
right
as
being
impaired.
now
louisiana
court
says,
“this
is
not
a
vested
right.”
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
i
would
have
--
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that
one
to
just
give
you
a
candid
answer.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
precisely
that
--
well,
question,
the
second.
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
we
talked
of
that
--
the
question
here
is
the
law
of
limitation.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
that
would
be
true
your
honor,
if
you
would
add
a
qualification
to
your
--
i
mean
a
provision
to
a
contract.
all
i'm
saying
if
it
last
for
10
years
unless
it
is
extended
by
drilling
for
production.
that’s
what
makes
the
case
of
contractual
prescription.
now,
i
had
conceded
already
an
argument
and
i
concede
in
brief
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
wouldn
not
think
so
your
honor.
the
promise
involved
here
is
not
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
thought
you
said
the
contract
would
have
to
make
it
clear.
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
oh!
yes.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
but
the
law
of
louisiana
was
clear
that
there
was
a
legal
classification
of
contractual
prescription.
the
government
have
missed
that
in
its
last
brief
when
they
bought
that
was
the
law
of
louisiana.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
the
contractual
prescription
is
the
same
as
statutory
prescription.
in
statutory
prescription
the
rule
has
been
clear
throughout
the
years
that
this
is
a
matter
of
remedy
based
on
the
--
the
remedy
lies
in
the
10-year
prescription,
the
limitation
act,
and
it
said
that
just
simply
does
not
form
a
part
of
the
contract
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
some
five
to
six
decisions
thereon.
it
is
the
same
as
cause
of
action,
precisely.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
the
respondents
in
this
case
can.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
sir;
yes,
certainly.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
your
honor,
i
respectfully
but
seriously
quarrel
with
that.
this
migratory
game
act
provides
specifically
for
the
secretary
of
interior
taking
title
subject
to
limitations,
easements,
everything
else;
provided
they
found
that
they
did
not
impair
the
use
of
the
refuge.
now,
he
found
that
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
but
he
had
a
way
knowing
that
your
honor.
there
may
have
been
100
wells
drilled
on
for
like
minerals
and
it
could
have
been
going
on
for
another
10
years.
so
he
faced
the
situation,
where
he
agreed
to
an
easement
of
indefinite
duration
and
clearly
he
must
have
found
because
the
act
requires
into
--
that
would
not
impair
the
use
of
the
refuge.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes
sir.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
press
appreciation
for
the
additional
time.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
i
think
that
this
case
is
somewhat
more
complicated
than
the
average
one
because
i
don’t
believe
the
government
and
respondents
are
together
on
what
issues
are
before
the
court
here
today.
we
consider
on
the
issue
of
question
that
there
are
two
and
only
two
issues
before
the
court.
one
is,
do
these
servitudes
involved
here,
these
mineral
reservations,
do
they
fit
the
definition
established
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
of
a
case
of
contractual
prescription,
so
as
to
make
effect
to
them
act
315
of
1940?
that’s
question
one.
then
if
they
do
in
the
act
did
so
applied
to
them,
then
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think,
there
is
a
reason
to
be
here
before
you
today.
as
so
applied,
do
they
violate
any
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution?
we
think
that
those
are
the
only
two
issues
before
the
court.
and
i
think
to
clarify
that
we
should
go
back
and
get
into
more
detail
about
the
history
of
the
leiter
minerals
litigation.
in
1957,
the
case
was
before
the
court.
a
majority
of
the
court
was
justice
douglas
dissenting
considered
the
act
315
in
1940
and
said
expressly
that
before
we
rule
on
the
constitution
at
nullity
of
that
act,
they
sent
it
back
it
to
the
state
court,
got
an
opinion
on
what
act
was
passed,
what’s
its
effect
and
is
it
constitutional
under
state
law.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
your
honor,
i
can
see
no
reason
at
all
to
have
sent
this
case
back
to
one
meritoriously
back
to
the
courts
and
it
got
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
compromised
into
that
of
leiter
minerals.
had
the
court
at
that
time,
taken
counsel’s
argument
and
said
that
federal
law
and
not
the
louisiana
law
should
apply
this.
it
could
have
been
disposed
of
at
that
hearing
and
then
nothing
else
to
do.
now,
justice
douglas
in
rather
picturesque
language
in
his
dissent
in
that
case
suggested
that
the
court
was
beating
the
devil
around
the
bush
by
not
going
ahead
and
deciding
it.
and
he
said
that
as
i
interpret
his
dissent
not
on
the
question
of
whether
state
law
or
federal
law
should
be
applied
but
that
the
court
was
counting
to
apply
either
one
of
them
without
sending
it
back.
having
just
taken
the
case
away
from
the
state
court
to
begin
with,
and
if
i
may
borrow
justice
douglas’
language,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
would
beat
the
devil
around
the
bush
some
seven
times
since
that
time
if
as
a
result
of
this
hearing
today
state
law
is
going
to
be
ignored
and
federal
law
is
going
to
be
applied.
there
have
been
five,
i
believe,
bigger
decisions
in
the
leiter
case
and
two
in
this
all
based
on
the
applicability
of
the
statute.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
your
honor,
i
would
get
to
that
at
the
moment
but
i’ll
answer
you
briefly
now.
the
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
two
occasions
to
be
retrospective
in
effect
and
to
be
constitutional
as
so
applied.
so,
if
we
are
going
to
take
half
of
louisiana
law,
i
think
we
have
to
take
the
other
half
too
then
testing
it
only
against
the
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
i’ll
deal
with
later.
but
if
the
louisiana
law
is
the
guiding
law
and
i
feel
so
strong
it
is,
then
part
of
that
law
is
that
this
is
a
remedial
right
only,
same
as
the
cause
of
action
and
that
it
can
be
lengthened
or
shortened.
it
has
been
done
both
the
louisiana
court.
it
has
been
shortened
as
well
lengthened
and
upheld
and
both
in
doing
that
and
upheld
as
a
retrospective
law.
now,
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general
that
some
federal
law
should
be
applied
here,
leaving
out
leiter
and
leaving
out
cases
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief,
united
states
versus
fox,
united
states
versus
yazell,
a
more
recent
case,
holding
it
where
isolated
land
transactions
were
involved.
the
law
of
the
situs
state
does
apply
to
the
exclusion
of
any
federal
law.
but
i
asked
myself
during
the
time
of
the
history
of
this
case,
if
the
court
pleases,
if
federal
law
has
to
be
applied,
what
federal
law?
here
we
have
a
complete
similar
concept
we’re
dealing
with
here.
that
mineral
reservation
procured
the
louisiana
and
not
true
with
any
other
49
states.
so,
where
would
we
find
that
federal
law?
in
its
reply
brief
which
i
just
received
over
the
weekend,
the
government
attempts
to
answer
that
on
page
11
and
that
suggests
that
have
no
difficulty
in
fashioning
a
federal
common
law
to
apply
in
these
circumstances
and
then
admittedly
citing
thompson
on
real
property
and
citing
the
common
law
approach
that
the
state
version
is
always
the
vested
interest.
for
my
civil
law
advantage,
if
the
court
pleases,
i
read
that
with
the
sense
of
almost
far.
it’s
just
completely
foreign
to
our
concept.
our
courts
has
squarely
held
that
this
right
or
expectancy
to
obtain
a
reversion
of
these
minerals
is
not
on
state
at
all.
it’s
not
a
property
interest.
it
can
even
be
solved
and
therefore
the
courts
have
held
that
you
can
validly
cut
across
the
limitation
period
or
prescriptive
period
as
running
against
that
servitude
and
that
expectancy
at
the
same
time.
now,
one
mentioned
by
mr.
reynolds
in
his
argument,
their
brief
suggests
that
the
migratory
bird
act
has
some
legal
significance
in
this
case
to
assist
in
the
application
of
federal
law
and
to
bring
into
place
some
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
were
raised.
i
believe
in
the
last
reply
brief,
they’ve
already
receded
from
that
but
we
submit
that
the
statute
did
just
the
obsolete.
while
we
concede
as
some
of
the
attorneys
in
the
case
have
precedingly
did,
that
congress
could
have
preempted
this
field,
just
a
mere
casual
reading
and
that
statute
shows
that
it
did
not.
it
specifically
preserved
the
jurisdiction
rights
of
the
state
and
the
statute
itself.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
[voice
overlap]
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
no,
sir.
louisiana
decision
construe
on
that.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
the
two
supreme
court
decision
right
on
that
cause.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
it’s
just
a
mere
hope
or
expectancy
that
taxes
to
the
land
and
it
follows
the
land.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
the
reversionary
rights,
yes
sir.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
no,
sir.
the
hope
of
getting
the
minerals
back,
yes,
in
other
words
if
in
five
years
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
sold
the
property
but
didn’t
reserve
the
minerals.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
now
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
if
you
could
not
sell
your
hope
of
getting
these
minerals
back,
mr.
justice.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
the
expectancy
rather
than
the
mineral
reserves.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
right.
you
can
of
course
sell
the
servitude
freely.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
true.
if
they
got
the
mineral
with
the
land,
yes
sir,
and
it’s
free
to
be
done
out
there.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
your
honor,
the
matter
is
complicated
only
to
this
extent.
our
courts
have
squarely
held
that
this
property
interest
is
not
a
property
interest,
this
reversionary
right.
it
held
that
it’s
a
mere
hope
or
expectancy
and
it’s
subject
to
retrospective
deed.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i’ll
return
to
that
--
well,
let
me,
the
fifth
circuit
court
in
the
united
states
versus
nebo
oil
company
probably
said
this
is
better
than
i
can
say
it
and
i
quote,
“we
conclude
that
this
so
called
reversionary
interest
is
nothing
more
than
a
mere
expectancy
or
hope
based
upon
an
anticipated
continuous
without
change
with
the
applicable
laws
of
prescription
and
cannot
be
regarded
as
a
vested
right
protected
by
the
constitution.”
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
thank
you.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
indulgence
and
although
it
will
require
some
repetition,
i
would
like
to
devote
my
remaining
time
here
today
to
a
step-by-step
analysis
of
the
four
legal
concepts
that
i
consider
are
applicable
in
this
case.
hoping
that
this
will
place
this
unique
civil
right
--
civil
law
problem
in
proper
perspective
for
the
court.
initially
thought,
i
will
say
in
the
absence
of
additional
questions
from
the
court,
i
will
lay
aside
any
further
discussion
of
the
point
that
state
law
should
be
applied
here
over
in
a
federal
law.
i
believe
this
is
fully
covered
in
the
briefs
and
consider
that
the
leiter
minerals’
opinion
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
other
cases
cited
in
the
respondent’s
brief
removes
us
as
a
serious
issue
in
the
case
and
while
certainly
no
concessions
have
been
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
had
a
feeling
from
the
government’s
reply
brief
and
the
argument
made
yesterday
that
this
does
not
--
will
not
disturb
the
government
too
seriously.
now,
the
four
items
to
be
considered
in
my
opinion
are
these:
first,
a
brief
discussion
of
the
legal
status
of
mineral
servitude
in
the
state
of
louisiana;
second,
a
consideration
of
the
three
types
of
mineral
servitudes
that
exist
in
that
state;
then
third,
the
legal
status
of
a
case
of
contractual
prescription,
which
on
question
is
involved
in
the
present
case;
and
fourth
and
finally,
the
precise
nature
of
the
so-called
reversionary
interests
of
the
united
states
in
a
case
of
contractual
prescription,
and
whether
any
of
the
constitutional
questions
raised
by
the
government
are
applicable
to
this
case.
now,
on
the
first
point,
i
will
not
devote
a
great
deal
of
time
to
the
basic
mineral
servitude.
its
nature
appeared
to
have
been
understood
by
the
court
yesterday.
except,
i
would
like
to
stress
that
in
louisiana,
there
can
be
no
separate
estate
in
minerals.
no
matter
what
form,
the
deed
or
reservation
is
placed
and
what
language
is
used,
only
a
servitude
or
easement
is
created
which
expires
in
10
years,
if
not
exercise
by
drilling.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
it
is;
it
is.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
know
of
no
other
states
that
has
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
--
has
that
rule.
no,
sir.
it
was
based
of
course
in
our
civil
law
concepts
and
no
such
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
am
satisfied
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
we
made
some
rather
serious
research
on
that
which
i
am
having
problem
too.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
just
one
evidence
that
it
is
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
consequence
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
that
it
involves
only
a
remedial
right,
the
prescription
of
limitation
of
10
years,
and
therefore,
can
be
valid
and
modified
by
subsequent
act
of
the
legislature.
that
is
a
precise
following
the
case.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
the
key
issue
in
the
case.
now,
i
will
say
that
this
strict
rule
of
no
separate
estate
and
no
mineral
estate
separate
from
the
fee
has
met
the
test
of
many
ingenious
offers
--
efforts
to
overcome
it.
sales
for
20
years,
sales
in
perpetuity,
probably
the
most
interesting
was
to
the
sale
purporting
to
transfer
the
fee
title
and
the
minerals
to
the
land
below
a
plain
500
feet
below
the
surface.
although
they
were
attempting
to
get
--
avail
both
the
title
and
the
minerals
but
of
course
there
are
those
that
are
simply
servitude
in
disguise.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
concept
that
the
fee
cannot
be
divided
into
separate
estates
has
cause
the
civil
law
in
our
civil
code
to
evolve
a
system
of
charges
and
burdens
upon
the
land.
in
other
words,
the
servitude
takes
the
place
of
a
separate
mineral
estate
but
the
courts
firmly
hold
that
such
a
servitude
does
not
give
the
owner
any
title
to
the
minerals
in
place.
he
simply
possesses
the
right
to
go
on
the
land
and
explore
for
and
reduce
those
minerals
to
his
possession.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
it
is
taken
from
the
french
law.
but
now
while
this
servitude
cannot
be
expanded
or
converted
into
a
separate
estate,
it
can
be
modified
by
contract
in
two
ways.
so
as
a
result,
we
wind
up
in
louisiana
with
three
types
of
servitudes
and
these,
i
might
add,
were
painstakingly
described
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
the
leiter
advisory
opinion.
now,
the
first
of
these
is
a
servitude
for
fix
term
of
five,
eight,
ten
years
with
no
provisions
whatever
for
extending
that
servitude.
now
currently,
this
is
a
vested
property
right
that
the
united
states
in
this
case
would
have
a
servitude
that
been
on
that
category,
because
act
315
could
not
have
impaired
that
right.
the
second
is
the
ordinary
statutory
servitude
previously
discussed
which
expires
in
10
years
unless
exercised
by
the
drilling
of
a
well
and
obtaining
a
production.
the
third
and
the
one
that’s
under
consideration
here
is
a
servitude
subject
to
contractual
prescription.
now,
there
are
two
and
only
two
requirements
to
establish
such
as
a
servitude:
one
is
that
when
it
is
originally
established,
it
must
be
of
uncertain
or
indefinite
duration;
and
second,
it
must
provide
for
its
conditional
extinguishment
in
some
way.
now,
adjacent
to
that
that
is
the
fact
that
the
servitude
in
this
case
mentioned
a
period
of
10
years
does
not
in
anyway
to
track
from
it
being
a
case
of
contractual
servitude.
actually
the
law
of
louisiana
does
that
and
had
the
period
not
been
mentioned.
we
consider,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
this
category
squarely
fits
the
servitudes
in
the
present
case.
they
provide
that
if
they
were
not
exercised
by
drilling
they
would
expire
in
10
years.
of
course,
whether
or
not
there
would
be
drilling
10
years
later,
clearly
it
was
uncertain
and
indefinite
event.
it
could
not
be
foreseen
at
the
time.
and
of
course
as
i
said,
that’s
simply
a
re-expression
of
louisiana
law,
because
the
servitude
could
not
last
for
more
than
10
years.
and
of
course,
it
also
clearly
provided
for
its
conditional
extinguishment
if
a
well
is
not
drilled
on
or
before
the
end
of
the
10-year
period.
now
the
only
the
departure
of
these
servitudes
from
the
statutory
type
is
the
effect
of
the
use
of
the
servitude
by
the
drilling
of
a
well.
a
well,
not
completed
as
a
producer
under
these
servitudes,
would
not
extend
the
servitude
for
full
period
of
10
years
as
would
be
the
case
and
statutory
interpretation,
by
the
contract
it
would
only
extend
it
for
90
days.
if
they
got
production
of
course
it
would
lasts
as
long
as
production
lasts.
but
we
submit,
if
the
court
pleases,
this
limitation
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
designation
and
the
classification
of
the
initial
servitude
as
being
one
of
contractual
prescription.
that
depends
entirely
on
the
terms
relating
to
the
10-year
period
and
the
method
by
which
it
could
be
extended
or
extinguished
at
the
end
of
that
10-year
period.
i
think
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
pages
12
and
13
of
the
respondent’s
brief,
you
will
find
quotations
from
the
supreme
court’s
advisory
opinion
on
leiter
that
say
that's
better
than
i
can
say
it.
for
example,
the
last
paragraph
on
page
12
says
this,
“most
mineral
servitudes
are
not
established
for
a
fix
time.
a
servitude
of
indefinite
duration
is
extinguished
only
when
it
is
not
exercised
for
a
period
of
10
years,
precisely
our
case.
such
a
servitude,
created
by
mineral
reservation
and
the
sale
to
the
government,
would
under
act
315
of
1940
be
rendered
imprescriptible
and
would
never
be
lost
by
prescription
provided
it
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
1940
act
went
into
effect.”
now,
the
second
quote
on
page
13,
“nevertheless
contracting
parties
are
at
liberty
to
establish
a
contractual
period
of
prescription
for
the
conditional
extinguishment
of
the
servitude
through
non-use
provided
that
the
period
is
10
years
or
less.”
again,
precisely
our
case.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
feel
also
greatly
(inaudible)
in
our
assertion
that
this
is
a
case
of
contractual
servitude
by
the
decisions
of
the
two
courts
below.
in
the
district
court,
a
train
louisiana
jurist
said
this
of
the
servitudes,
“clearly
these
servitudes
present
cases
of
contractual
prescription.”
in
the
fifth
circuit
with
the
panel
containing
one
of
our
most
distinguished
louisiana
jurists,
the
court
quoted
that
language
of
approval
and
said,
and
of
course
as
a
result
to
that
act
315
makes
imprescriptible
this
servitude.
so,
i
think
when
these
louisiana
juries
reach
as
a
conclusion
without
any
problem
whatever,
it
is
for
some
benefit
to
our
contention
that
we
do
have
cases
of
contractual
prescription.
now,
we
now
turn
to
what
the
legal
status
of
the
case
of
contractual
prescription
is.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
squarely
that
it
is
identical
with
that
of
the
statutory
prescription.
therefore,
the
court
in
that
connection
to
page
30
of
our
brief
where
this
was
said
by
the
court,
speaking
of
act
315
of
1940,
“the
act
grows
no
distinction
between
statutory
and
contractual
prescription
and
as
we
view
the
matter
from
the
history
of
the
act,
and
the
objects,
and
purposes
for
which
it
was
adopted,
it
is
manifest
that
the
legislature
intended
the
act
to
be
applicable
to
prescription
whether
established
by
statute
or
by
contract.
for
prescription
had
not
already
accrued
at
the
time
that
the
act
became
effective.”
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
repeated
argument
of
the
government,
it
is
over
and
above
act
315,
because
it
has
a
contract
seems
to
ask
to
beg
the
question
entirely.
the
question
is,
“what
did
that
contract
do?”
and
under
the
supreme
court
resolution
to
this
thing,
it
clearly
established
the
case
of
contractual
prescription.
the
brief
of
the
government
acknowledges
that
the
law
of
contractual
prescription
was
in
existence
when
the
servitudes
were
purchased.
the
government
is
bound
to
know
the
law,
it
was
charged
with
knowing
the
law,
and
certainly
it
was
aware
of
the
rule
that
if
a
contractual
prescription
was
established,
then
it
could
be
modified
either
lengthened
or
shortened
as
prescription
applicable
to
it
by
subsequent
legislative
act.
now,
this
brings
us
to
the
final
and
decisive
issue
in
the
case
in
our
view.
with
a
clear
case
of
contractual
prescription
bringing
to
vow
the
legal
principles
of
applying
to
statutory
prescription,
what
were
the
legal
rights
of
united
states
with
respect
to
its
so-called
reversionary
interests
when
act
315
of
1940
was
adopted?
again,
the
state
law
is
crystal
clear
on
his
point.
holding
that
since
only
a
law
prescription
of
limitation
is
involved.
this
law
goes
only
to
matters
of
remedy
and
does
not
form
a
part
of
the
contract
itself.
and
that
therefore,
the
period
of
prescription
maybe
shortened
or
lengthened
without
impairing
the
obligations
of
the
contract.
this,
of
course,
is
because
no
vested
rights
were
involved.
in
fact,
we
have
a
specific
decision
of
our
louisiana
supreme
court
cited
on
page
35
of
our
brief
where
act
315
was
applied
retrospectively
to
a
reservation
of
mineral
rights
and
a
sale
to
the
united
states
and
was
held
to
be
constitutional
under
state
constitution.
now,
the
ground
on
all
of
this,
if
your
honor
please,
is
quite
fundamental.
it
simply
is
based
on
the
recognition
that
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
stewart
yesterday
that
the
reversionary
interests
is
not
a
vested
right
at
all,
but
it
is
merely
an
inchoate
hope
or
expectancy
based
on
the
laws
of
prescription
or
limitation
which
could
be
changed
for
by
legslative
act.
and
i
repeat
again
my
statement
yesterday,
there
is
no
resemblance
whatever
between
this
so-called
reversionary
interests.
it
really
should
be
called
a
hope
or
expectancy
and
the
common
law
state
in
reversion.
there
is
simply
no
legal
resemblance
at
all.
now,
this
court
has
also
refute
to
recognize
that
for
a
statute
of
limitation
are
involved
which
exist
when
a
contract
is
executed,
do
not
form
a
part
of
that
contract.
and
therefore,
they
may
be
modified
or
even
abrogated
with
respect
to
a
pre-existing
contract
of
constitution.
this
case
is
cited
on
page
32
of
our
brief.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
in
its
reply
brief
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
don’t
think
they
are,
your
honor.
let’s
see.
no,
they
all
seem
to
be
ogden
versus
saunders,
campbell
versus
holt,
jeff
o’brien
versus
williams.
no,
sir
it
could
not
be.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
received
by
me
only
over
the
weekend.
in
spite
of
those
in
reference
to
mr.
reynolds’
part
of
pace
in
the
ad.
they
apparently
recognized
a
probability
with
application
of
louisiana
law
and
they
attempt
to
analyze
their
rights
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
under
these
contracts.
that
is
done
on
pages
2,
3,
and
4
of
their
brief.
now,
i
must
mention
that
i
am
somewhat
troubled
over
the
use
on
page
3
of
the
brief
of
the
old
louisiana
decision
of
federal
land
bank
versus
mulhern
and
a
quotation
from
that
case
which
indicates
that
some
of
the
principles
i
just
announced
here
may
not
be
correct.
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
that
concept
was
retracted
by
the
supreme
court
in
this
very
case
on
rehearing
and
it’s
never
been
repeated
since.
it
simply
has
no
place
in
our
law.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
page
2
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
government.
on
page
3,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
of
the
government,
yes
sir,
about
federal
land
bank
versus
mulhern.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
no,
i
said
in
mulhern
case
on
rehearing.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
retracted,
it
was
not
this
particularly;
it
was
retracted
and
said
we’re
going
back
to
the
common
law
concept
which,
i
mean
the
civil
law
concept
which
i
just
described.
now
as
i
said,
the
government
now
is
offering
to
the
court
its
analysis
to
the
law
of
louisiana
and
that
is
found
in
the
first
complete
paragraph
on
page
4
of
the
reply
brief
and
it
says
this,
“consequently,
once
the
conveyance
is
involved
in
the
present
case
were
consummated,
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
its
undisputed
ownership
of
the
surface
rights
in
the
land
in
question
had
a
paramount
interest
in
the
minerals
below
the
surface
subject
only
to
the
limited
servitude
stipulated
in
the
reservations.”
now
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
lay
aside
beside
with
that
conclusion.
this
quotation
from
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
in
the
leiter
minerals
advisory
opinion
and
i
quote,
“in
this
case,
when
property
is
conveyed
and
the
mineral
rights
are
reserved,
the
party
reserving
the
minerals
is
vested
with
a
real
right,
the
right
to
go
up
on
the
land
and
produce
the
minerals.
in
such
a
case,
the
purchase
of
the
land
subject
to
this
servitude
does
not
acquire
the
mineral
rights.
as
to
the
minerals,
all
the
purchaser
has
acquired
is
the
expectancy
or
hope
that
the
mineral
servitude
will
be
extinguished
by
the
10-year
prescription
of
non-use,
and
will
not
be
extended
or
continued
by
use
beyond
this
period,
for
the
minerals
had
been
reserved,
the
purchase
of
the
land
pays
nothing
for
them
and
has
no
vested
right
in
them.”
then
quoting
from
a
prior
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
tennant
versus
russell,
the
court
says
this,
“a
right
is
vested
when
the
right
to
enjoinment,
present
or
prospective
has
become
the
property
of
some
particular
person
or
persons
as
a
present
interest.
the
right
must
be
absolute,
complete,
and
unconditional
independent
of
a
contingency,
and
a
mere
expectancy
of
future
benefit.
or
a
contingent
interest
in
property
does
not
constitute
a
vested
right.”
so
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
if
this
concept
of
the
louisiana
law
is
accepted
by
this
court
and
applied.
we
think
that
all
of
the
constitutional
issues
raised
by
the
united
states
contract,
property,
supremacy
are
dissolve
in
thin
air
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
any
vested
interest
in
this
so-called
reversionary
interest
of
the
government.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
thank
you
very
much.
now
the
reservation,
if
your
honor
please,
is
found
on
page
180
of
the
addendum
of
our
brief.
there
are
two
of
them
but
they
are
identical
with
mr.
reynolds’
notice
yesterday
and
that
starts
off
by
simply
making
the
normal
reservation
that
would
be
involved
in
the
statutory
prescription.
reserving
the
right
to
drill
for
and
to
produce
into
lay
pipe
lines
and
do
all
the
necessary
incidental
things
which
rights
will
remain
enforced
for
a
period
10
years
from
the
date
of
vesting
title
in
united
states.
and
as
long
thereafter
as
oil,
gas,
sulfur,
or
some
other
minerals
produced
in
the
land
or
so
long
thereafter
as
grantor
shall
conduct
drilling
or
reworking
operations
thereon
with
no
cessation
of
more
than
60
consecutive
days
until
production
results.
if
production
results,
of
course
it
remains
in
effect
indefinite.
now,
this
language,
your
honor,
the
paragraph
i
just
read,
is
identical
with
the
law
of
statutory
prescription
with
the
same
exemption
that
i
noted
earlier,
that
the
drilling
operations
must
be
conducted
as
60-day
intervals
to
maintain
the
servitude,
if
they
do
not
result
in
production.
otherwise,
this
is
a
straight
tracking
of
the
louisiana
law.
and
provided
further,
if
in
the
said
ten-year
period
of
reservation,
if
not
extended
as
here
above
provided
or
the
termination
of
any
extended
period,
the
operation
has
not
been
that
carried
on
the
right
to
provide
and
so
forth,
shall
terminate
and
complete
fee
title
so
thereby
it
become
vested
in
united
states.
then,
i
think
there
is
an
important
royalty
provision.
if
your
honor
please,
this
simply
is
saying
that
if
this
conditional
extinguishment
and
it
is
fairly
conditional
because
it
depends
on
the
will
of
the
servitude
on
as
to
whether
you
drill
or
not
drill
occurs,
then
of
course
the
mineral
right
is
terminated.
that
of
course
would
be
true
in
the
case
of
statutory
prescription.
so,
we
say
that
it's
a
single
exception
your
honor,
of
the
limitation
just
place
on
the
drilling
that
there’s
no
difference
between
this
contract
reservation
and
one
that
would
be
made
under
the
law
of
louisiana.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
your
honor,
if
i
am
not
sure
you
got
my
time
too
much
that
is
a
question
i
was
dying
to
get
into.
the
history
of
the
saying
is
that
this
act
was
passed
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states.
if
--
i
didn’t
cite
it
in
my
brief
but
if
the
court
will
refer
to
the
original
opinion
of
the
district
court
in
the
united
states
versus
nebo
oil
co.,
you
will
find
the
complete
history
of
why
it
was
adopted.
united
states
was
the
largest
purchaser
of
lands
in
louisiana.
it
was
having
increase
in
trouble
buying
lands
because
the
people
did
not
want
to
sell
and
have
their
mineral
rights
possibly
terminated
in
10
years,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
in
order
to
facilitate
its
purchase
of
the
land
in
louisiana,
this
act
was
adopted.
now,
it’s
a
valid
reason
too
because
louisiana
is
an
oil
rich
state.
it’s
almost
impossible
to
purchase
lands
at
any
price
if
the
minerals
are
not
reserve
in
tracks
of
in
sizeable
size.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
assume
it
could
have,
your
honor,
but
there
we
are
adverting
then
to
the
question
of,
what
was
the
right,
the
reversionary
right
gained
by
the
united
states.
that
did
not
so
when
they
get
them
as
apply
retrospectively.
but
again,
we
are
just
at
the
point
of
that
reversionary
interest
of
the
united
states
was
such
an
interest
that
could
be
cut
across
by
intervening
statute.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
that
is
right
that
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that
is
correct.
i
might
add
too
in
fact,
to
answer
the
question
that
louisiana
runs
in
the
same
problems
and
not
too
long
after
this
statute
was
adopted,
they
adopted
an
identical
statute
making
the
same
imprescriptibility
rule
with
respect
to
all
purchases
made
by
any
agency
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
right.
exactly.
so
we
have
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
private
parties,
no.
the
only
rule
as
to
private
parties
is
that
prescription
does
not
run
against
the
matter
and
prescription
is
extended
as
the
court
made
rule
thereon.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
assume
so
the
government
would
be
purchasing
this
property
in
proprietor
capacity.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
because
the
statute
is
limited
to
united
states.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
think
your
honor,
and
this
nebo
discussion
will
bear
this
out,
i
believe.
it
was
applied
because
united
states
was
having
a
serious
problem
in
its
land
acquisitions
in
louisiana,
and
it
was
applied
for
as
benefit
not
as
a
case
of
hostile
discrimination
as
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
it
certainly
does,
but
now
where
that
impact
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
for
that
outweighs
the
benefit
the
united
states
gain
by
its
future
acquisitions
is
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
we
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
first
of
all
we
don’t
think
united
states
is
a
person;
second
and
this
is
the
basic
concept
that
i
am
doing
my
outmost
to
get
across,
whether
it
was
wisely
done
or
equitably
done,
it
did
not
deprive
the
united
states
in
this
case
of
contractual
prescription
of
any
vested
contract
right.
now,
if
it
had
no
right
to
assert,
we
just
don’t
think
any
of
the
constitutional
issues
come
into
play.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
am
not
sure,
i
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
that’s
correct.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
but
the
contract
whether
there’s
an
interest
in
realty
or
just
an
interest,
the
contract
clause
in
nominal
pain
only
applies
if
you
have
some
vested
right
as
being
impaired.
now
louisiana
court
says,
“this
is
not
a
vested
right.”
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
i
would
have
--
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that
one
to
just
give
you
a
candid
answer.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
precisely
that
--
well,
question,
the
second.
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
we
talked
of
that
--
the
question
here
is
the
law
of
limitation.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
that
would
be
true
your
honor,
if
you
would
add
a
qualification
to
your
--
i
mean
a
provision
to
a
contract.
all
i'm
saying
if
it
last
for
10
years
unless
it
is
extended
by
drilling
for
production.
that’s
what
makes
the
case
of
contractual
prescription.
now,
i
had
conceded
already
an
argument
and
i
concede
in
brief
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
wouldn
not
think
so
your
honor.
the
promise
involved
here
is
not
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
i
thought
you
said
the
contract
would
have
to
make
it
clear.
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
oh!
yes.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
but
the
law
of
louisiana
was
clear
that
there
was
a
legal
classification
of
contractual
prescription.
the
government
have
missed
that
in
its
last
brief
when
they
bought
that
was
the
law
of
louisiana.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
the
contractual
prescription
is
the
same
as
statutory
prescription.
in
statutory
prescription
the
rule
has
been
clear
throughout
the
years
that
this
is
a
matter
of
remedy
based
on
the
--
the
remedy
lies
in
the
10-year
prescription,
the
limitation
act,
and
it
said
that
just
simply
does
not
form
a
part
of
the
contract
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
some
five
to
six
decisions
thereon.
it
is
the
same
as
cause
of
action,
precisely.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
well,
the
respondents
in
this
case
can.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
sir;
yes,
certainly.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
your
honor,
i
respectfully
but
seriously
quarrel
with
that.
this
migratory
game
act
provides
specifically
for
the
secretary
of
interior
taking
title
subject
to
limitations,
easements,
everything
else;
provided
they
found
that
they
did
not
impair
the
use
of
the
refuge.
now,
he
found
that
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes,
but
he
had
a
way
knowing
that
your
honor.
there
may
have
been
100
wells
drilled
on
for
like
minerals
and
it
could
have
been
going
on
for
another
10
years.
so
he
faced
the
situation,
where
he
agreed
to
an
easement
of
indefinite
duration
and
clearly
he
must
have
found
because
the
act
requires
into
--
that
would
not
impair
the
use
of
the
refuge.
mr.
austin
w.
lewis
yes
sir.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
press
appreciation
for
the
additional
time.
