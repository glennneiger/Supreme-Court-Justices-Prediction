so
there’s
nothing
about
conduct
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
just
the
suppression
on
the
book,
sales
of
books.
justice
potter
stewart
we’re
talking
about
18.1-236
that’s
on
page

(a)
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
certiorari
petition.
it
does
say
that
the
order
to
show
cause
shall
be
directed
against
the
book
by
name
or
description.
then,
it
goes
on
to
say
authorizing
the
court
to
issue
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
the
sale
or
distribution
of
the
book
alleged
to
be
obscene.
now,
does
that
order
also
run
against
the
book
so
it
makes
anybody
who
sells
it
anywhere
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
-
justice
potter
stewart
violate
the
order.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
suppose
that
means?
what
do
you
suppose
that
subparagraph
13
means?
justice
potter
stewart
so
all
of
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
didn’t
mean
to
--
i’m
sorry.
i
didn’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
this
statute,
all
you
--
all
that
the
--
it’s
ultimately
secured
if
there’s
a
finding
that
the
book
is
obscene.
it
is
a
kind
of
a
declaratory
judgment,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
way
it
looks
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
or
after
such
a
declaratory
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
there
is
no
--
ultimately
there
is
no
--
this
statute
itself
doesn’t
either
--
it
doesn’t
impose
any
restraint
ultimately
on
the
sale.
it’s
just
a
judgment.
the
court
shall
order
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
enter
judgment
that
the
book
is
obscene.
that’s
the
end
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
affirmed
that
permanent
injunction?
