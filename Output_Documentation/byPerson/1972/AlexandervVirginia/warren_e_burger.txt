do
you

it

very

mr.

mr.
kulp.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kulp,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
suppose
the
book
dealer
had
1,000
of
the
particular
book
that
came
under
the
ban
of
this
statue
in
the
view
of
the
commonwealth
and
you
proceeded
against
one
of
them
in
the
in
rem
proceeding,
the
book
--
against
the
book
itself.
would
it
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
if
this
dealer
gave
the
balance
of
the
books
away
for
nothing
instead
of
selling
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
he
give
them
away
to
minors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
disguise
this
all
along
as
an
in
rem
procedure,
but
of
course
an
injunction
is
not
an
in
rem
procedure,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn’t
it
be
res
adjudicata
as
to
the
book
itself
if
it’s
an
in
rem
action
as
to
the
first
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
an
ancient
statute
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
kulp.
mr.
dietz,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
the
temporary
restraining
order,
procedurally
under
this
statute,
directed
at
the
period
between
the
seizure
of
the
book
and
the
determination
of
its
quality?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
the
temporary
restraining
order,
in
effect,
between
the
date
of
the
seizure
and
the
date
of
the
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
the
specific
issues
or
just
to
the
same
magazine
on
some
other
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
would
be
the
whole
story,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
dietz.
mr.
kulp,
your
argument
is
submitted,
but
if
there
is
any
virginia
statute
which
authorizes
a
permanent
injunction,
it
has
escaped
our
attention
in
the
briefs
and
you
may
call
our
attention
to
it,
if
there
is
such,
sending
a
copy
of
course
to
your
friend.
i’m
not
suggesting
you
submit
additional
argument
but
merely
a
citation
if
any.
