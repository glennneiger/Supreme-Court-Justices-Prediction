what’s
the
first
amendment
got
to
do
with
jury
trials,
at
least
on
its
face?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
want
not
only
a
jury
but
a
jury
of
the
kind
they’ve
got
500
years
ago
where
the
jury
brings
its
own
knowledge
to
decide
whether
to
hear
the
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
criminal
case,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
virginia
procedure,
it’s
a
possible
offense
for
someone
else
who
had
no
connection
with
the
people
who
are
defending
against
the
state
in
the
first
action?
could
those
people
re-litigate
in
some
other
court
the
question
of
whether
they
were
obscene,
because
they
weren’t
parties
at
the
first
action
or
would
the
books
themselves
be
branded
as
obscene
by
virtue
of
the
in
rem
character?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
said,
didn’t
they,
that
where
something
was
found
to
be
obscene,
it
was
perfectly
proper
to
enjoin
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
fits
to
that
effect,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
they
didn’t
pass
--
they
did
say
“where
something
is
found
to
be
obscene,
under
virginia
law
it’s
proper
to
enjoin
them.”
