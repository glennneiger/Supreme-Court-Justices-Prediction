mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
third
act
in
your
trilogy
of
obscenity
cases,
but
i
am
not
going
to
follow
the
line
urged
by
mr.
fleishman
and
mr.
brown--
excuse
me,
by
mr.
smith.
and
that
is
because,
as
i
view
the
exhibits
involved
in
my
case
and
as
all
of
the
testimony
that
was
produced
by
the
commonwealth
and
by
the
defense
that
our
material
did
not
involved
hardcore
pornography,
which
brings
me
to
think
about
the
roth
case
because
the
roth
case
involved
hardcore
pornography.
the
case
--
certiorari
was
granted
on
the
limited
point
of
whether
hardcore
pornography
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
you
ruled
that
it
was
not.
in
the
roth
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
post
office
department
submitted
exhibits,
examples
of
what
hardcore
pornography
really
was.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
because
your
honor
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court,
i
was
not
involved
in
that
case
so
i
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
sir,
but
i
understood
that
there
were
exhibits
submitted
of
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
stand
and
correct
it.
actually,
i
felt
that
in
this
pornography
field
it
had
really
boiled
down
over
the
years
to
interpreting
the
roth
case
to
mean
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes,
sir.
of
course,
in
the
very
recent
case,
reidel,
you
--
the
court,
again,
stated
that
hardcore
pornography
or
that
obscenity
was
not
constitutionally
protected.
well,
my
argument
is
that
the
materials
in
this
case,
if
you
compare
them
with
other
materials
with
this
--
which
this
court
has
had
under
consideration
in
such
matters
as
weiner
and
dolan
(ph)
versus
california,
which
depict
only
simulated
sexual
activities,
simulated
sexual
activities
which
i
would
define
as
possibly
inches
or
possibly
seconds
away
from
the
actual
consummation,
but
leaving
to
the
imagination
the
actual
graphic
depiction,
the
actual
passage
of
the
scene,
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
draw
the
line
at
that
line
at
that
place,
differentiating
between
simulated
sexual
activities
which
should
be
constitutionally
protected
if
you
have
the
other
elements
involved
for
adults
only
and
without
any
obtrusive
advertising,
which
is
the
school
of
law
which
has
mushroomed
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
redrup
versus
new
york.
now,
in
this
case
that
i
have
today,
we
have
a
statute
in
the
state
of
virginia.
it’s
a
civil
statute,
although
it’s
part
of
the
criminal
code,
and
it
provides
for
any
person,
state’s
attorney
or
commonwealth
attorney,
any
person,
any
citizen
to
bring
an
action
to
declare
a
book
obscene.
it
specifically
prohibits
a
jury
trial.
i,
therefore,
say
it
is
unconstitutional,
because
in
an
obscenity
case
i
feel
a
jury
trial
is
mandated
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
i
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
spell
out
the
jury
trial,
but
if
you
take
the
roth
case
definition
of
what
is
obscenity
and
what
is
not
constitutionally
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
then
it
must
be
decided
by
community
standards
and
the
community
is
the
jury.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
sir.
i
would
follow
the
guidance
of
late
justice
frankfurter
in
smith
versus
california
when
he
said
that
it’s
a
jury
question
that
you
have
to
introduce
expert
testimony
of
these
points
of
prurient
interest
and
community
standards
to
guide
the
jury
in
their
deliberations.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
smith
versus
california
was
a
criminal
case.
i
recognize
the
distinction,
and
roth
was
a
criminal
case.
at
the
same
time,
this
court
decided
kingsley
books
case,
kingsley
books
versus
new
york,
regents
of
new
york.
that
case
was
a
civil
case
and
it
did
not
raise
this
issue
of
a
jury
trial
because,
in
that
case,
a
jury
was
not
requested.
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
noted
that
advisory
jury
was
available
in
new
york
but
none
was
requested,
but
in
my
case,
i
have,
right
from
the
outset,
requested
a
jury
trial
but
this
state
statute
specifically
prohibits
jury
determination.
and,
through
my
experience
in
defending,
representing
this
particular
company,
we
have
many,
many
instances
where
a
jury
looks
at
obscenity
exhibits
differently
than
a
judge
alone.
you
have
pending
in
this
court
a
petition
for
certiorari,
another
case
that
i
had,
of
village
books
versus
marshall
where
a
judge
viewed
a
book
and
said
that
was
obscene.
he
issued
an
injunction
against
it
in
the
state
of
maryland.
that
same
book
tried
before
a
jury,
three
different
jurors,
three
different
jurisdictions,
acquitted
because
that
was
he
criminal
cases
and
i
recognize
there’s
a
different
standard
of
proof
involved.
but,
i
feel
very
strongly
that
first
amendment
case,
obscenity
case,
a
jury
trial
should
be
allowed
where
prayed.
the
second
point
that
i
claim
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
is
that
it
specifically
provides
for
the
community
standard
to
be
a
city
or
a
county.
it
doesn’t
even
limit
the
community
standard
the
way
that,
in
the
case
that
mr.
fleishman
argued
to
the
state
of
california,
it’s
not
the
state
of
virginia.
it’s
evidence
of
community
standards
in
that
city,
in
that
county.
this
is
--
of
course
it’s
very
easy
for
the
state
to
say
“well,
how
else
can
we
get
experts?”
there
are
no
things
as
an
expert
on
national
community
standards.
so,
what
are
we
faced
with?
we
are
faced
with
a
so-called
expert
who,
as
we
have
in
the
record
of
this
case,
who
had
been
part
of
a
group
that
studied
obscenity
a
year-and-a
half
before
in
that
area
and
who
had
spoken
with
different
people
in
various
civic
groups
which
consisted
of
the
navy
wives
club
and
who
hadn’t
been
in
an
adult
bookstore
in
a
year
or
more,
which
i
use
the
phrase
“adult
bookstore”
to
be
referred
to
in
the
california
case
as
“dirty
bookstores.”
well,
i
take
issue
with
that.
adult
bookstores
are
stores
that
only
trade
with
adults,
who
do
not
allow
juvenile’s
entrance
and
it’s
so-stipulated
in
our
case
that
we
do
not
do
business
with
juveniles.
all
the
states
or
nearly
all
the
states
have
statutes.
the
district
of
columbia
does,
the
state
of
maryland
does,
where
they
differentiate
a
different
penalties
involved
if
you
deal
with
juveniles
in
the
obscenity
field,
but
that
was
not
an
issue.
they
stipulate
in
our
case
no
juveniles
involved.
so,
it
brings
us
back
to
the
community
of
portsmouth
and,
i
might
say,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
you
have
in
los
angeles
some
250
adult
bookstores.
this
bookstore
was
the
one
and
only
bookstore
in
the
city
of
portsmouth.
i
don’t
know
the
exact
population.
i
think
it’s
about
70,000-75,000
people,
but
this
is
the
only
bookstore
--
adult
bookstore
in
that
city.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
sir.
i
mention
not,
because
i
was
discussing
community
standards
and,
earlier,
i
heard
in
argument
--
statement
that,
are
we
to
apply
the
community
from
some
small
city
in
montana
as
a
standard
as
compared
with
the
entire
state
of
california.
california
is
covered
with
adult
bookstores.
there
are
not
quite
so
many
in
the
tidewater
area.
there
are
approximately
10
that
i
am
aware
of,
but
only
1
in
the
city
of
portsmouth.
now,
our
community
standards
is
--
might
be
argued
that
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
community
don’t
go
into
these
bookstores
and
don’t
make
purchases
from
these
bookstores.
well,
i
would
then
argue
to
this
court
that
this
is
quite
true.
the
majority
of
the
people
are
not
costumers
in
my
client’s
bookstore,
but
the
first
amendment
was
not
made
or
created
to
protect
only
the
majority
view
but
i
think,
principally,
the
minority
view
point.
that’s
the
one
where
you
have
under
the
first
amendment
the
right
to
get
up
and
say
“well,
i
don’t
agree
with
all
you
people.
this
is
my
point
of
view.”
and
that’s
what’s
being
done
in
this
bookstore
in
the
city
of
portsmouth.
now,
if
i
might,
at
this
point,
refer
to
another
element
of
the
issue
of
obscenity,
they
claim
that
and
the
judge,
in
his
opinion,
found
these
books
to
be
patently
offensive,
patently
offensive
to
whom?
certainly
not
to
the
customers
who
go
into
that
bookstore.
they
are
not
forced
in.
we
don’t
have
sidewalks
that
pop
them
into
the
store
as
they
walk
by.
an
adult
bookstore,
and
particularly
the
adult
bookstore
in
portsmouth
has
the
windows
blocked
out.
you
cannot
see
inside
and
there
are
big
signs,
“adult
bookstore,
no
minors
allowed”.
and,
if
anyone
comes
into
the
store
who
might
be
close
to
the
age
of
majority,
he
must
demonstrate
his
credentials
to
prove
that
he
is,
in
fact,
adult.
now,
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
claim
as
far
as
the
statute
being
unconstitutional
is
that
it
affects
a
prior
restraint.
i
won’t
spend
too
much
time
on
this
point
because
they
never,
in
fact,
got
the
restraint
off
the
ground.
they,
in
this
case,
they
went
into
the
bookstore,
took
a
list
of
all
of
the
books
that
had
anything
to
do
with
sex,
issued
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
the
management
of
the
store
to
appear
in
court
with
a
copy
of
the
books.
the
people
appeared
and
the
books
were
taken.
following
which,
the--
two
of
the
judges
reviewed
the
books
and
issued
a
show
cause
order
and
the
commonwealth
attorney
filed
a
petition
asking
that
all
of
these
books
be
declared
obscene.
now,
at
that
time,
they
also
filed
a
notice
to
the
two
employees
of
the
bookstore.
i
think
three
or
four
days
later,
they
were
going
to
ask
the
court
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
this
is
where
we
claim
there
would
have
been
a
prior
restraint.
it
would
have
been
granted
had
not
we
gone
into
federal
court
to
ask
for
an
injunction.
then,
the
motion
for
restraining
order
was
continued
indefinitely
and
we
never
actually
did
have
a
hearing
on
the
motion
for
restraining
order,
but
this
restraining
order
would
have
been
in
effect.
there
is
absolutely
no
time
limit
as
this
court
has
held
constitutionally
mandated
in
obscenity
statutes
of
this
nature.
there
is
no
time
limit
other
than
the
general
boundary
that
it
should
be
heard
as
soon
as
possible,
as
soon
as
it’s
expedient.
as
it
turned
out,
in
this
case,
these
proceedings
started
in
may
and
the
hearing
was
held
in
november.
the
decision
did
not
come
until
december
of
the
same
year.
now,
in
this
court’s
granting
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
you
added
as
an
issue
whether
or
not
these
sexually
oriented
materials
are
constitutionally
protected.
now,
we
feel
this
case
to
be
the
perfect
vehicle
for
the
argument
that,
following
redrup,
this
material
is
constitutionally
protected.
firs
of
all,
because
it
does
not
involve
any
material
which
could
be
considered
hardcore
pornography,
and
definition
of
hardcore
pornography
of
course
we
draw
from
the
opinion
of
justice
stewart
which,
i
believe,
was
actually
the
definition
of
the
united
states
government
in
us
v.
ginsberg.
and,
in
all
of
our
materials,
we
do
not
have
that
element
of
graphic
depiction
of
sexual
activities.
the
testimony
that
was
produced
by
the
state
of
many
of
their
witnesses
said
that
this
is
not
hardcore
pornography.
one
of
them
said
it
would
only
be
obscene
for
juveniles,
for
19-year-olders.
so,
that
was
a
gentleman
who
was
a
part
time
police
officer
and
part
time
printer
who
testified
as
an
expert
for
the
state
of
virginia.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
if
it
please
the
court,
i’d
like
the
opportunity
to
answer
a
few
of
the
questions
that
the
court
posed
to
mr.
kulp.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
believe
you
asked
the
question
regarding
giving
away
of
this
material
of
this
statute
which
appears
on
19
(a)
that
deals
only,
in
paragraph
one,
whenever
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
any
person
is
engaged
in
the
sale
or
commercial
distribution
of
any
obscene
book,
etcetera,
any
citizen
or
the
attorney
for
the
commonwealth
of
any
county,
etcetera,
may
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
now,
that
is
particularly
interesting,
because
it
says
any
citizen
who
has
an
interest
and
then
we
get
to
the
issue
of
this
injunction,
because
if
you
will
consider
the
very
final
paragraph
of
the
statute
as
it
appears
on
22
(a)
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
paragraph
13,
“it
is
expressly
provided
that
the
petition
and
proceeding,
authorized
under
this
article,
relating
to
books
alleged
to
be
obscene,
shall
be
intended
only
to
establish
scienter
in,
cases
where
the
establishment
of
such
scienter
is
thought
to
be
useful
or
desirable
by
the
petitioner.”
“only
to
establish
scienter,”
i
cannot
visualize
how
any
common
citizen
who
might
be
offended
by
the
sale
of
a
book
would
be
concerned
about
scienter
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
believe
that
they
intended
it
to
open
the
door
for
them
to
use
this
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
virginia
that
this
statute
is
vague
and
unconstitutional.
it
contends
no
provision
for
granting
an
injunction,
no
provision
for
an
injunction.
it
only
contends
a
provision
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
and
that
is
in
paragraph
5.
and
it
does
have,
as
its
valid
purpose,
only
to
prove
or
establish
scienter
whenever
it
might
be
considered
important
by
--
to
the
petitioner.
and,
of
course,
in
this
case
in
the
lower
court
and
in
this
brief,
i
argued
that
the
judge
overstepped
his
balance
in
even
granting
this
permanent
injunction
and
he
never
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
would
have
to
assume
so.
it
does
not
so-state,
but
it
does
say
that
this
can
be
granted
upon
four
days
notice
after
the
filing
of
the
original
show
cause
order.
now,
the
show
cause
order
has
to
be
advertised
in
a
newspaper
for
three
weeks.
following
which,
the
respondents
or
any
interested
party
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
defend.
as
it
occurred
in
this
case,
because
this
was
a
bookstore
that
had
counsel,
i
immediately
came
into
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
had
a
counsel
even
at
the
time
that
they
served
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
and
when
we
produced
the
books
in
the
court.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
it
was
never
issued.
the
motion
was
never
granted.
now,
i
might
clarify
this.
mr.
kulp
said
that
i
agreed
to
a
continuance.
actually,
i
believe
that
if
you
read
the
record
carefully,
i
appeared
in
court
on
the
day
that
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
to
have
been
heard
and
i
asked
--
first,
i
asked
them
for
a
stay,
which
was
denied,
then,
i
asked
him
to
just
continue
it
indefinitely,
which
was
granted,
because
--
and
that
was
not
the
trial,
that
was
only
the
temporary
restraining
order
feature,
because
i
had
filed
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
asking
for
an
injunction
to
prevent
--
prohibit
any
further
proceedings
in
the
court
of
hewstings,
and
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that’s
what
stopped
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
i
say
that’s
what
stopped
the
court
from
issuing
the
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
i
wouldn’t
say
a
declaratory
judgment
--
well,
right,
a
declaratory
judgment,
but
it
says
it’s
only
to
be
used
to
establish
scienter
when
anybody
should
have
any
further
use
for
it.
so,
i
would
assume
that
if
they
brought
--
if
they
went
ahead
and
sold
these
books
while
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
in
effect
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
or
after
judgment,
then
they
could
come
into
court
and
get
around
the
--
what
this
court
said
they
must
prove
in
smith
versus
california
as
far
as
scienter
or
knowledge
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
material
by
a
bookseller.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that’s
according
to
the
statute
but,
as
it
was
applied
and
had
the
entire
order
printed
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
19
(a),
the
judge
did
issue
a
permanent
injunction
against
my
client
and
restrain
them
from
either
the
sale
or
commercial
distribution
of
all
of
the
magazines,
and
that
--
all
of
the
magazines,
that’s
an
interesting
point
because
--
and
i
argued
to
the
court
below
that
some
of
these
magazines
had
been
considered
by
this
court
in
different
cases,
but
he’s
still
enjoying
those
as
well,
even
though
this
court
had
applied
constitutional
protection
to
these
magazines.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
as
it
so
happen,
this
was
the
same
magazine.
i’m
not
sure
of
the
specific
issue,
but
if
it
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes
sir,
but
if
you
look
at
the
magazine
involved,
you
just
compare
it
and
the
magazines
were
girly
magazines
and
the
only
thing
that
changes
is
the
face
of
the
girl.
the
position,
everything
else,
is
the
same.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
inferred
the
entire
proceedings
of
the
court
below,
and
i
argued
this
point
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
don’t
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
the
general
effect
was
they
sustained
the
lower
court.
so,
they
sustained
the
injunction.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
believe
that’s
a
general
effect,
justice
rehnquist,
but--
well,
i’ll
say
no
more.
that’s
what
they
did.
i
don’t
believe
that
they
acted
within
their
jurisdiction
in
doing
that
anymore
than
judge
bane
acted
within
his
jurisdiction
under
this
statute
in
issuing
the
injunction.
this,
as
was
argued
by
mr.
kulp,
this
is
a
creature
of
statute
only.
there’s
no
common
law
right
to
declare
a
book
obscene,
non-mailable.
it’s
only
by
a
statute
and
this
judge
exceeded
what
the
legislature
intended
that
he
had
the
power
to
do
in
his
authorization.
i
argued
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
i
have
that
in
my
brief
and
that
is
the
prime
pertinent
reason
and,
i
believe,
my
time
has
expired.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions
by
any
member
of
the
court,
i’ll
submit.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
third
act
in
your
trilogy
of
obscenity
cases,
but
i
am
not
going
to
follow
the
line
urged
by
mr.
fleishman
and
mr.
brown--
excuse
me,
by
mr.
smith.
and
that
is
because,
as
i
view
the
exhibits
involved
in
my
case
and
as
all
of
the
testimony
that
was
produced
by
the
commonwealth
and
by
the
defense
that
our
material
did
not
involved
hardcore
pornography,
which
brings
me
to
think
about
the
roth
case
because
the
roth
case
involved
hardcore
pornography.
the
case
--
certiorari
was
granted
on
the
limited
point
of
whether
hardcore
pornography
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
you
ruled
that
it
was
not.
in
the
roth
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
post
office
department
submitted
exhibits,
examples
of
what
hardcore
pornography
really
was.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
because
your
honor
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court,
i
was
not
involved
in
that
case
so
i
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
sir,
but
i
understood
that
there
were
exhibits
submitted
of
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
stand
and
correct
it.
actually,
i
felt
that
in
this
pornography
field
it
had
really
boiled
down
over
the
years
to
interpreting
the
roth
case
to
mean
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes,
sir.
of
course,
in
the
very
recent
case,
reidel,
you
--
the
court,
again,
stated
that
hardcore
pornography
or
that
obscenity
was
not
constitutionally
protected.
well,
my
argument
is
that
the
materials
in
this
case,
if
you
compare
them
with
other
materials
with
this
--
which
this
court
has
had
under
consideration
in
such
matters
as
weiner
and
dolan
(ph)
versus
california,
which
depict
only
simulated
sexual
activities,
simulated
sexual
activities
which
i
would
define
as
possibly
inches
or
possibly
seconds
away
from
the
actual
consummation,
but
leaving
to
the
imagination
the
actual
graphic
depiction,
the
actual
passage
of
the
scene,
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
draw
the
line
at
that
line
at
that
place,
differentiating
between
simulated
sexual
activities
which
should
be
constitutionally
protected
if
you
have
the
other
elements
involved
for
adults
only
and
without
any
obtrusive
advertising,
which
is
the
school
of
law
which
has
mushroomed
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
redrup
versus
new
york.
now,
in
this
case
that
i
have
today,
we
have
a
statute
in
the
state
of
virginia.
it’s
a
civil
statute,
although
it’s
part
of
the
criminal
code,
and
it
provides
for
any
person,
state’s
attorney
or
commonwealth
attorney,
any
person,
any
citizen
to
bring
an
action
to
declare
a
book
obscene.
it
specifically
prohibits
a
jury
trial.
i,
therefore,
say
it
is
unconstitutional,
because
in
an
obscenity
case
i
feel
a
jury
trial
is
mandated
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
i
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
spell
out
the
jury
trial,
but
if
you
take
the
roth
case
definition
of
what
is
obscenity
and
what
is
not
constitutionally
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
then
it
must
be
decided
by
community
standards
and
the
community
is
the
jury.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
sir.
i
would
follow
the
guidance
of
late
justice
frankfurter
in
smith
versus
california
when
he
said
that
it’s
a
jury
question
that
you
have
to
introduce
expert
testimony
of
these
points
of
prurient
interest
and
community
standards
to
guide
the
jury
in
their
deliberations.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
smith
versus
california
was
a
criminal
case.
i
recognize
the
distinction,
and
roth
was
a
criminal
case.
at
the
same
time,
this
court
decided
kingsley
books
case,
kingsley
books
versus
new
york,
regents
of
new
york.
that
case
was
a
civil
case
and
it
did
not
raise
this
issue
of
a
jury
trial
because,
in
that
case,
a
jury
was
not
requested.
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
noted
that
advisory
jury
was
available
in
new
york
but
none
was
requested,
but
in
my
case,
i
have,
right
from
the
outset,
requested
a
jury
trial
but
this
state
statute
specifically
prohibits
jury
determination.
and,
through
my
experience
in
defending,
representing
this
particular
company,
we
have
many,
many
instances
where
a
jury
looks
at
obscenity
exhibits
differently
than
a
judge
alone.
you
have
pending
in
this
court
a
petition
for
certiorari,
another
case
that
i
had,
of
village
books
versus
marshall
where
a
judge
viewed
a
book
and
said
that
was
obscene.
he
issued
an
injunction
against
it
in
the
state
of
maryland.
that
same
book
tried
before
a
jury,
three
different
jurors,
three
different
jurisdictions,
acquitted
because
that
was
he
criminal
cases
and
i
recognize
there’s
a
different
standard
of
proof
involved.
but,
i
feel
very
strongly
that
first
amendment
case,
obscenity
case,
a
jury
trial
should
be
allowed
where
prayed.
the
second
point
that
i
claim
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
is
that
it
specifically
provides
for
the
community
standard
to
be
a
city
or
a
county.
it
doesn’t
even
limit
the
community
standard
the
way
that,
in
the
case
that
mr.
fleishman
argued
to
the
state
of
california,
it’s
not
the
state
of
virginia.
it’s
evidence
of
community
standards
in
that
city,
in
that
county.
this
is
--
of
course
it’s
very
easy
for
the
state
to
say
“well,
how
else
can
we
get
experts?”
there
are
no
things
as
an
expert
on
national
community
standards.
so,
what
are
we
faced
with?
we
are
faced
with
a
so-called
expert
who,
as
we
have
in
the
record
of
this
case,
who
had
been
part
of
a
group
that
studied
obscenity
a
year-and-a
half
before
in
that
area
and
who
had
spoken
with
different
people
in
various
civic
groups
which
consisted
of
the
navy
wives
club
and
who
hadn’t
been
in
an
adult
bookstore
in
a
year
or
more,
which
i
use
the
phrase
“adult
bookstore”
to
be
referred
to
in
the
california
case
as
“dirty
bookstores.”
well,
i
take
issue
with
that.
adult
bookstores
are
stores
that
only
trade
with
adults,
who
do
not
allow
juvenile’s
entrance
and
it’s
so-stipulated
in
our
case
that
we
do
not
do
business
with
juveniles.
all
the
states
or
nearly
all
the
states
have
statutes.
the
district
of
columbia
does,
the
state
of
maryland
does,
where
they
differentiate
a
different
penalties
involved
if
you
deal
with
juveniles
in
the
obscenity
field,
but
that
was
not
an
issue.
they
stipulate
in
our
case
no
juveniles
involved.
so,
it
brings
us
back
to
the
community
of
portsmouth
and,
i
might
say,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
you
have
in
los
angeles
some
250
adult
bookstores.
this
bookstore
was
the
one
and
only
bookstore
in
the
city
of
portsmouth.
i
don’t
know
the
exact
population.
i
think
it’s
about
70,000-75,000
people,
but
this
is
the
only
bookstore
--
adult
bookstore
in
that
city.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
no,
sir.
i
mention
not,
because
i
was
discussing
community
standards
and,
earlier,
i
heard
in
argument
--
statement
that,
are
we
to
apply
the
community
from
some
small
city
in
montana
as
a
standard
as
compared
with
the
entire
state
of
california.
california
is
covered
with
adult
bookstores.
there
are
not
quite
so
many
in
the
tidewater
area.
there
are
approximately
10
that
i
am
aware
of,
but
only
1
in
the
city
of
portsmouth.
now,
our
community
standards
is
--
might
be
argued
that
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
community
don’t
go
into
these
bookstores
and
don’t
make
purchases
from
these
bookstores.
well,
i
would
then
argue
to
this
court
that
this
is
quite
true.
the
majority
of
the
people
are
not
costumers
in
my
client’s
bookstore,
but
the
first
amendment
was
not
made
or
created
to
protect
only
the
majority
view
but
i
think,
principally,
the
minority
view
point.
that’s
the
one
where
you
have
under
the
first
amendment
the
right
to
get
up
and
say
“well,
i
don’t
agree
with
all
you
people.
this
is
my
point
of
view.”
and
that’s
what’s
being
done
in
this
bookstore
in
the
city
of
portsmouth.
now,
if
i
might,
at
this
point,
refer
to
another
element
of
the
issue
of
obscenity,
they
claim
that
and
the
judge,
in
his
opinion,
found
these
books
to
be
patently
offensive,
patently
offensive
to
whom?
certainly
not
to
the
customers
who
go
into
that
bookstore.
they
are
not
forced
in.
we
don’t
have
sidewalks
that
pop
them
into
the
store
as
they
walk
by.
an
adult
bookstore,
and
particularly
the
adult
bookstore
in
portsmouth
has
the
windows
blocked
out.
you
cannot
see
inside
and
there
are
big
signs,
“adult
bookstore,
no
minors
allowed”.
and,
if
anyone
comes
into
the
store
who
might
be
close
to
the
age
of
majority,
he
must
demonstrate
his
credentials
to
prove
that
he
is,
in
fact,
adult.
now,
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
claim
as
far
as
the
statute
being
unconstitutional
is
that
it
affects
a
prior
restraint.
i
won’t
spend
too
much
time
on
this
point
because
they
never,
in
fact,
got
the
restraint
off
the
ground.
they,
in
this
case,
they
went
into
the
bookstore,
took
a
list
of
all
of
the
books
that
had
anything
to
do
with
sex,
issued
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
the
management
of
the
store
to
appear
in
court
with
a
copy
of
the
books.
the
people
appeared
and
the
books
were
taken.
following
which,
the--
two
of
the
judges
reviewed
the
books
and
issued
a
show
cause
order
and
the
commonwealth
attorney
filed
a
petition
asking
that
all
of
these
books
be
declared
obscene.
now,
at
that
time,
they
also
filed
a
notice
to
the
two
employees
of
the
bookstore.
i
think
three
or
four
days
later,
they
were
going
to
ask
the
court
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
this
is
where
we
claim
there
would
have
been
a
prior
restraint.
it
would
have
been
granted
had
not
we
gone
into
federal
court
to
ask
for
an
injunction.
then,
the
motion
for
restraining
order
was
continued
indefinitely
and
we
never
actually
did
have
a
hearing
on
the
motion
for
restraining
order,
but
this
restraining
order
would
have
been
in
effect.
there
is
absolutely
no
time
limit
as
this
court
has
held
constitutionally
mandated
in
obscenity
statutes
of
this
nature.
there
is
no
time
limit
other
than
the
general
boundary
that
it
should
be
heard
as
soon
as
possible,
as
soon
as
it’s
expedient.
as
it
turned
out,
in
this
case,
these
proceedings
started
in
may
and
the
hearing
was
held
in
november.
the
decision
did
not
come
until
december
of
the
same
year.
now,
in
this
court’s
granting
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
you
added
as
an
issue
whether
or
not
these
sexually
oriented
materials
are
constitutionally
protected.
now,
we
feel
this
case
to
be
the
perfect
vehicle
for
the
argument
that,
following
redrup,
this
material
is
constitutionally
protected.
firs
of
all,
because
it
does
not
involve
any
material
which
could
be
considered
hardcore
pornography,
and
definition
of
hardcore
pornography
of
course
we
draw
from
the
opinion
of
justice
stewart
which,
i
believe,
was
actually
the
definition
of
the
united
states
government
in
us
v.
ginsberg.
and,
in
all
of
our
materials,
we
do
not
have
that
element
of
graphic
depiction
of
sexual
activities.
the
testimony
that
was
produced
by
the
state
of
many
of
their
witnesses
said
that
this
is
not
hardcore
pornography.
one
of
them
said
it
would
only
be
obscene
for
juveniles,
for
19-year-olders.
so,
that
was
a
gentleman
who
was
a
part
time
police
officer
and
part
time
printer
who
testified
as
an
expert
for
the
state
of
virginia.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
if
it
please
the
court,
i’d
like
the
opportunity
to
answer
a
few
of
the
questions
that
the
court
posed
to
mr.
kulp.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
believe
you
asked
the
question
regarding
giving
away
of
this
material
of
this
statute
which
appears
on
19
(a)
that
deals
only,
in
paragraph
one,
whenever
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
any
person
is
engaged
in
the
sale
or
commercial
distribution
of
any
obscene
book,
etcetera,
any
citizen
or
the
attorney
for
the
commonwealth
of
any
county,
etcetera,
may
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
now,
that
is
particularly
interesting,
because
it
says
any
citizen
who
has
an
interest
and
then
we
get
to
the
issue
of
this
injunction,
because
if
you
will
consider
the
very
final
paragraph
of
the
statute
as
it
appears
on
22
(a)
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
paragraph
13,
“it
is
expressly
provided
that
the
petition
and
proceeding,
authorized
under
this
article,
relating
to
books
alleged
to
be
obscene,
shall
be
intended
only
to
establish
scienter
in,
cases
where
the
establishment
of
such
scienter
is
thought
to
be
useful
or
desirable
by
the
petitioner.”
“only
to
establish
scienter,”
i
cannot
visualize
how
any
common
citizen
who
might
be
offended
by
the
sale
of
a
book
would
be
concerned
about
scienter
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
believe
that
they
intended
it
to
open
the
door
for
them
to
use
this
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
virginia
that
this
statute
is
vague
and
unconstitutional.
it
contends
no
provision
for
granting
an
injunction,
no
provision
for
an
injunction.
it
only
contends
a
provision
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
and
that
is
in
paragraph
5.
and
it
does
have,
as
its
valid
purpose,
only
to
prove
or
establish
scienter
whenever
it
might
be
considered
important
by
--
to
the
petitioner.
and,
of
course,
in
this
case
in
the
lower
court
and
in
this
brief,
i
argued
that
the
judge
overstepped
his
balance
in
even
granting
this
permanent
injunction
and
he
never
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
would
have
to
assume
so.
it
does
not
so-state,
but
it
does
say
that
this
can
be
granted
upon
four
days
notice
after
the
filing
of
the
original
show
cause
order.
now,
the
show
cause
order
has
to
be
advertised
in
a
newspaper
for
three
weeks.
following
which,
the
respondents
or
any
interested
party
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
defend.
as
it
occurred
in
this
case,
because
this
was
a
bookstore
that
had
counsel,
i
immediately
came
into
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
had
a
counsel
even
at
the
time
that
they
served
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
and
when
we
produced
the
books
in
the
court.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
it
was
never
issued.
the
motion
was
never
granted.
now,
i
might
clarify
this.
mr.
kulp
said
that
i
agreed
to
a
continuance.
actually,
i
believe
that
if
you
read
the
record
carefully,
i
appeared
in
court
on
the
day
that
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
to
have
been
heard
and
i
asked
--
first,
i
asked
them
for
a
stay,
which
was
denied,
then,
i
asked
him
to
just
continue
it
indefinitely,
which
was
granted,
because
--
and
that
was
not
the
trial,
that
was
only
the
temporary
restraining
order
feature,
because
i
had
filed
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
asking
for
an
injunction
to
prevent
--
prohibit
any
further
proceedings
in
the
court
of
hewstings,
and
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that’s
what
stopped
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
i
say
that’s
what
stopped
the
court
from
issuing
the
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
i
wouldn’t
say
a
declaratory
judgment
--
well,
right,
a
declaratory
judgment,
but
it
says
it’s
only
to
be
used
to
establish
scienter
when
anybody
should
have
any
further
use
for
it.
so,
i
would
assume
that
if
they
brought
--
if
they
went
ahead
and
sold
these
books
while
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
in
effect
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
or
after
judgment,
then
they
could
come
into
court
and
get
around
the
--
what
this
court
said
they
must
prove
in
smith
versus
california
as
far
as
scienter
or
knowledge
of
the
obscene
nature
of
the
material
by
a
bookseller.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
that’s
according
to
the
statute
but,
as
it
was
applied
and
had
the
entire
order
printed
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
19
(a),
the
judge
did
issue
a
permanent
injunction
against
my
client
and
restrain
them
from
either
the
sale
or
commercial
distribution
of
all
of
the
magazines,
and
that
--
all
of
the
magazines,
that’s
an
interesting
point
because
--
and
i
argued
to
the
court
below
that
some
of
these
magazines
had
been
considered
by
this
court
in
different
cases,
but
he’s
still
enjoying
those
as
well,
even
though
this
court
had
applied
constitutional
protection
to
these
magazines.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
as
it
so
happen,
this
was
the
same
magazine.
i’m
not
sure
of
the
specific
issue,
but
if
it
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
yes
sir,
but
if
you
look
at
the
magazine
involved,
you
just
compare
it
and
the
magazines
were
girly
magazines
and
the
only
thing
that
changes
is
the
face
of
the
girl.
the
position,
everything
else,
is
the
same.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
inferred
the
entire
proceedings
of
the
court
below,
and
i
argued
this
point
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
don’t
--
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
well,
the
general
effect
was
they
sustained
the
lower
court.
so,
they
sustained
the
injunction.
mr.
stanley
m.
dietz
i
believe
that’s
a
general
effect,
justice
rehnquist,
but--
well,
i’ll
say
no
more.
that’s
what
they
did.
i
don’t
believe
that
they
acted
within
their
jurisdiction
in
doing
that
anymore
than
judge
bane
acted
within
his
jurisdiction
under
this
statute
in
issuing
the
injunction.
this,
as
was
argued
by
mr.
kulp,
this
is
a
creature
of
statute
only.
there’s
no
common
law
right
to
declare
a
book
obscene,
non-mailable.
it’s
only
by
a
statute
and
this
judge
exceeded
what
the
legislature
intended
that
he
had
the
power
to
do
in
his
authorization.
i
argued
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
i
have
that
in
my
brief
and
that
is
the
prime
pertinent
reason
and,
i
believe,
my
time
has
expired.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions
by
any
member
of
the
court,
i’ll
submit.
