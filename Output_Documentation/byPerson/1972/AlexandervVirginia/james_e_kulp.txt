mr.
james
e.
kulp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
the
downside
of
this
case,
it
must
be
borne
in
mind,
that
the
type
of
procedure
we’re
talking
about
involved
in
this
case
is
a
civil
procedure
in
realm
as
opposed
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
procedures
in
virginia
under
this
civil
procedure
provides
for
no
criminal
sanctions
whatsoever.
it’s
merely
an
action
against
the
books
which
are
alleged
to
be
obscene.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
that’s
correct.
this
statute
is,
of
course,
a
creature
of
statute
and
was
unknown
in
the
common
law.
it’s
long
been
established
that
neither
the
state
nor
the
federal
constitution
guarantees
or
preserves
a
right
to
jury
trial
except
in
those
cases
where
it
existed
when
the
constitutions
were
adopted.
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
deal
exclusively
with
criminal
proceedings
and
the
seventh
amendment,
while
dealing
with
civil
actions,
pertains
to
suits
at
common
law
and
where
bail
exceeds
$20.
in
kingsley
books
versus
brown,
this
court
upheld
a
new
york
statute
which
is
very
similar
to
the
statute
involved
in
this
case,
and
a
determination
in
the
new
york
case
was
for
a
procedure
without
a
jury.
and,
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
for
this
court
to
limit
the
state
in
resorting
to
various
weapons
and
armory
of
the
law
and
it
can
use
the
criminal,
civil,
or
some
combination
of
these
two
procedures.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
so,
because
the
statutes,
as
i
recall
and
believe
to
be
in
virginia,
is
that
if
sale
or
some
commercialism
involved,
whether
it
was
a
transfer
of
this,
i
don’t
believe
that
would
come
under
the
statute
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
he
can
do
that.
there’s
a
specific
statute
which
would
prohibit
the
giving
of
the
articles
to
minors.
i
might
have
to
back
up.
i
think
that,
probably,
the
criminal
statute
in
virginia
might
even
prohibit
the
giving
of
these
books
to
another
person.
now,
the
question
about
the
prior
restraint,
of
course,
as
this
court
knows
and
the
record
shows,
there
was
no
prior
restraint
in
this
case
and,
as
mr.
dietz
says,
advised
the
court.
the
one
thing
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
is
the
fact
that
the
record
will
show,
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
in
the
record,
the
trial
record
itself,
it
will
show
that
mr.
dietz
agreed
to
continue
this
case.
so,
this
question
of
when
the
case
started
and
when
it
ended
is
not
exactly
a
matter
of
time
that
is
really
for
this
court
to
consider
in
the
prior
restraint
aspects,
because,
as
this
court
indicated
in
37
photographs,
it
said
that
no
seizure
or
forfeiture
will
be
invalidated
for
delay
where
the
claimant
is
responsible
for
extending
either
the
administrative
action
or
judicial
determination
beyond
allowable
time
limits.
so,
i
simply
submit
that,
in
this
case,
mr.
dietz
did
not
prosper
any
hearing
in
this
matter
and,
in
fact,
going
in
and
requested
a
continuance.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
the
books
are
permanently
enjoined,
as
they
were
in
this
case,
from
being
sold.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
there’s
no
destruction
statute
involved.
now,
as
to
the
community
standards,
of
course,
this
statute
sets
a
community
standard
being
the
community
wherein
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
that’s
correct
and
if
he
violates
it,
of
course,
could
be
subject
to
a
contempt
of
court.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
they
were
all
single
copies
that
were
brought
in.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
most
of
them
soft-covered.
i
don’t
think
there
were
any
hard-covered
books.
they
were
large
more
like
--
they’re
really
magazines
as
opposed
to
little
pocketbooks.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
photographs.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
it
is
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
it’s
against
the
books
and
it
sales
that
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
they
may
not
be
sold,
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
that
he
might
then
subject
himself
to
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
if
the
books
were
sold.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
would
say,
there’s
no
probably
no
statute
in
virginia
which
would
prohibit
that.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
it’s
--
actually
it’s
an
injunctive
procedure
but
it
goes
against
the
books
as
against
an
--
as
opposed
to
a
person.
the
procedure
is
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
it
names
the
people
who
are
the
producers
or
the
publishers
of
these
books.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
it
enjoins
them
from
selling
these
particular
books
which
have
been
listed
in
the
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes.
well,
i
think
that
the
procedure
does
allow
for
the,
and
calls
for
the
injunction
for
these
persons
not
to
sell
these
books
which
have
been
judged
to
be
obscene.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
i
think
that,
probably,
they
would
be
able
to
litigate
it
in
some
other
situation.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
decision
to
the
effect
that
those
books
have
been
declared
obscene,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
injunction
would
only
apply
to
those
people
who
were
brought
into
court
as
parties
or
who
were
served
with
notice.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
this
is
fairly
recent.
i
don’t
know.
i
can
--
i
don’t
--
it’s
not
within
the
last
two
or
three
years,
but
i
think
it
was
in
1960
if
i’m
not
mistaken,
somewhere
along
that
time.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
in
a
notice
on
page
19
(a)
that
the
statute
was
--
on
22
(a),
was
enacted
a
chapter
233
of
the
acts
presumed
at
1960.
as
to
the
community
standards,
the
first
amendment,
in
clear
language,
states
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
press.
there’s
no
specific
mention
of
the
states
in
this
amendment
and
the
freedom
of
speech
has
been
made
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
therefore,
what
the
states
may
constitutionally
do
in
this
area
must
be
judged
upon
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
not
upon
the
language
of
the
first
amendment.
the
question
arises
as
how
would
a
national
standard
be
determined?
would
each
locality
have
to
have
its
own
set
of
“experts”
to
go
around
the
country
in
order
to
ascertain
what
material
is
acceptable?
how
many
people
would
be
required
to
be
interviewed?
would
they
be
required
to
go
into
the
rural
areas
as
well
as
to
the
large
metropolitan
areas?
if
a
national
standard
is
required,
we
will
be
relegated
to
the
type
expert
which
the
appellants
presented
in
this
case.
it
appears
that
this
dr.
hamlin,
who
was
in
the
georgia
case,
also
appeared
in
this
case.
we
get
experts
from
out
of
state
who
come
into
town
on
the
day
of
the
trial
and,
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
they
spent
no
more
than
10
or
15
minutes
thumbing
through
not
more
than
half
of
the
books
which
were
involved
in
this
case
and
then
making
their
opinions
known
to
the
court.
we
compare
this
to
what
the
state
experts
did
on
the
other
hand.
these
people
are
all
local
people.
they
had
examined
each
book
thoroughly.
they
had
knowledge
of
what
the
customs
were
and
what
the
community
standards
were
in
portsmouth,
virginia,
and
as
former
chief
justice
warren
said
in
jacobellis,
he
said
he
didn’t
believe
that
there
was
a
provable
standard
and
that
this
court
had
not
been
able
to
annunciate
one,
and
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
the
local
courts
to
define
one.
as
this
court
said
in
missouri
versus
lewis,
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
profess
to
secure
all
persons
in
the
united
states
to
benefit
the
same
laws
and
the
same
remedies.
great
diversities,
in
this
respect,
may
exist
in
two
states,
separated
only
by
an
imaginary
line.
when
we
get
to
the
question
which
this
court
asked
counsel
to
brief
and
argue,
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
the
display
of
any
sexually
oriented
pictorial
magazines
for
commercial
sale
were
surrounded
by
notice
to
the
public
of
that
nature
and
by
reasonable
protection
against
exposure
of
the
magazines
to
juveniles,
the
answer,
i
believe,
to
this
question
depends
upon
whether
we’re
talking
about
sexually
oriented
pictorial
magazines
which
are
obscene.
if
the
magazines
are,
in
fact,
obscene,
then
there
is
not
constitutional
protection
for
the
reason
that
in
roth
this
court
held
that
obscenity
was
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech.
this
question
was
clearly
answered,
i
believe,
in
the
negative
in
united
states
versus
reidel
decided
in
may
of
last
year.
in
reidel,
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
whether
the
government
could
constitutionally
prohibit
the
distribution
by
the
mails
of
obscene
materials
to
willing
recipients
who
state
that
they
are
adults.
to
which
question,
this
court
responded
by
holding
that
the
government
could
prohibit
discrimination
of
obscene
material
through
the
mails.
this
court
expressly
rejected
the
argument
that
stanley,
somehow,
limited
roth
and
that
the
state
and
federal
governments
were
constitutionally
limited
to
prohibiting
distribution
of
obscene
materials
to
juveniles
and
unconsenting
adults.
stanley
recognized
that
the
states
retain
broad
powers
to
regulate
obscenity.
there’s
being
a
espouse
to
proposition
that
since
the
president’s
commission
on
obscenity
found
no
cause
of
relationship
between
pornography
in
any
social
conduct
and
sex
crimes,
then
the
states
have
no
interest
in
protecting
consenting
adults
from
pornography.
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
that
this
argument
completely
takes
away
from
the
states
the
right
to
reject
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
president’s
commission.
the
commission’s
report
has
not
only
been
rejected
by
the
president,
by
the
senate,
it
has
been
criticized
by
the
scholars.
the
commission’s
study
did
not
explore
the
long
range
effects
of
frequent
exposure
to
the
obscene.
at
the
time
the
commission
was
concluding
that
public
opinion
did
not
support
any
legal
restrictions
on
the
right
of
adults
to
read
or
view
explicit
sexual
material,
the
gallup
opinion
index
found
80%
of
the
adult
population
bearing
stricter
laws
on
pornography
and
a
harris
poll,
at
the
same
time,
found
76%
of
the
population
want
pornography
legislature
--
literature
outlawed.
the
commission
also
reported
that
in
copenhagen,
the
rape
--
a
reported
rape
declined
during
the
period
in
which
pornography
has
been
widely
available.
therefore,
the
commission
concluded
that
there
was
no
cause
or
connection
between
sex
crimes
and
pornography.
however,
the
commission
completely
dismissed
the
fact
that,
in
this
country,
adult
arrest
or
forceful
rapes
increased
50%
in
the
last
decade
when
the
availability
of
erotic
material
also
increased.
the
obscenity
report
published
by
stein
&
day
publishers
in
1970
found
evidence
of
a
demonstrable
correlation
between
rising
obscenity
statistics
and
rising
crime
rates.
within
the
last
few
weeks,
a
british
study
found
that
british
society
was
threatened
by
the
growth
of
pornography.
commonsense
does
suggest
that
if
good
literature
can
ennoble
its
readers,
fowl
literature
can
degrade
them
and
that
to
depersonalize
and
derational
--
romanticize
sex
may
be
damaging
and
certainly
cannot
be
helpful
to
the
development
of
happy
human
relationships.
the
people
who
are
presently
saying
that
a
book
does
not
corrupt
are
the
very
same
ones
who
seemed
convinced
that
displays
of
violence
on
television
do
indeed
have
the
power
to
corrupt.
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
is
that
in
the
question
of
the
area
of
obscenity
that
this
court
has
specifically
held
in
roth
and
reiterated
in
stanley
and
reiterated
once
again
in
reidel
and
37
photographs
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
while
it
may
true,
and
while
it
may
be
proven
true
at
some
time,
that
certain
areas
in
this
law
should
be
changed.
it’s
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
that
this
matter
rests
in
the
hands
of
the
legislature.
and,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
believe
i
might
be
able
to
answer
that
right
now.
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
no
statute
which
authorizes
the
permanent
injunction,
which
the
court
declared
in
this
case,
but
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
its
decision
which
is
shown
on
page
2
(a)
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
held
that
if
the
material
is
judged
to
be
obscene,
then
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
restrain
its
sale
or
distribution.
so,
this
is
the
statutory
construction
put
on
it
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
the
downside
of
this
case,
it
must
be
borne
in
mind,
that
the
type
of
procedure
we’re
talking
about
involved
in
this
case
is
a
civil
procedure
in
realm
as
opposed
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
procedures
in
virginia
under
this
civil
procedure
provides
for
no
criminal
sanctions
whatsoever.
it’s
merely
an
action
against
the
books
which
are
alleged
to
be
obscene.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
that’s
correct.
this
statute
is,
of
course,
a
creature
of
statute
and
was
unknown
in
the
common
law.
it’s
long
been
established
that
neither
the
state
nor
the
federal
constitution
guarantees
or
preserves
a
right
to
jury
trial
except
in
those
cases
where
it
existed
when
the
constitutions
were
adopted.
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
deal
exclusively
with
criminal
proceedings
and
the
seventh
amendment,
while
dealing
with
civil
actions,
pertains
to
suits
at
common
law
and
where
bail
exceeds
$20.
in
kingsley
books
versus
brown,
this
court
upheld
a
new
york
statute
which
is
very
similar
to
the
statute
involved
in
this
case,
and
a
determination
in
the
new
york
case
was
for
a
procedure
without
a
jury.
and,
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
for
this
court
to
limit
the
state
in
resorting
to
various
weapons
and
armory
of
the
law
and
it
can
use
the
criminal,
civil,
or
some
combination
of
these
two
procedures.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
so,
because
the
statutes,
as
i
recall
and
believe
to
be
in
virginia,
is
that
if
sale
or
some
commercialism
involved,
whether
it
was
a
transfer
of
this,
i
don’t
believe
that
would
come
under
the
statute
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
he
can
do
that.
there’s
a
specific
statute
which
would
prohibit
the
giving
of
the
articles
to
minors.
i
might
have
to
back
up.
i
think
that,
probably,
the
criminal
statute
in
virginia
might
even
prohibit
the
giving
of
these
books
to
another
person.
now,
the
question
about
the
prior
restraint,
of
course,
as
this
court
knows
and
the
record
shows,
there
was
no
prior
restraint
in
this
case
and,
as
mr.
dietz
says,
advised
the
court.
the
one
thing
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
is
the
fact
that
the
record
will
show,
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
in
the
record,
the
trial
record
itself,
it
will
show
that
mr.
dietz
agreed
to
continue
this
case.
so,
this
question
of
when
the
case
started
and
when
it
ended
is
not
exactly
a
matter
of
time
that
is
really
for
this
court
to
consider
in
the
prior
restraint
aspects,
because,
as
this
court
indicated
in
37
photographs,
it
said
that
no
seizure
or
forfeiture
will
be
invalidated
for
delay
where
the
claimant
is
responsible
for
extending
either
the
administrative
action
or
judicial
determination
beyond
allowable
time
limits.
so,
i
simply
submit
that,
in
this
case,
mr.
dietz
did
not
prosper
any
hearing
in
this
matter
and,
in
fact,
going
in
and
requested
a
continuance.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
the
books
are
permanently
enjoined,
as
they
were
in
this
case,
from
being
sold.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
there’s
no
destruction
statute
involved.
now,
as
to
the
community
standards,
of
course,
this
statute
sets
a
community
standard
being
the
community
wherein
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
that’s
correct
and
if
he
violates
it,
of
course,
could
be
subject
to
a
contempt
of
court.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
they
were
all
single
copies
that
were
brought
in.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
most
of
them
soft-covered.
i
don’t
think
there
were
any
hard-covered
books.
they
were
large
more
like
--
they’re
really
magazines
as
opposed
to
little
pocketbooks.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
photographs.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
it
is
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
it’s
against
the
books
and
it
sales
that
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
they
may
not
be
sold,
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
that
he
might
then
subject
himself
to
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
if
the
books
were
sold.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
would
say,
there’s
no
probably
no
statute
in
virginia
which
would
prohibit
that.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
it’s
--
actually
it’s
an
injunctive
procedure
but
it
goes
against
the
books
as
against
an
--
as
opposed
to
a
person.
the
procedure
is
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes
sir,
it
names
the
people
who
are
the
producers
or
the
publishers
of
these
books.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
it
enjoins
them
from
selling
these
particular
books
which
have
been
listed
in
the
--
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes.
well,
i
think
that
the
procedure
does
allow
for
the,
and
calls
for
the
injunction
for
these
persons
not
to
sell
these
books
which
have
been
judged
to
be
obscene.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
i
think
that,
probably,
they
would
be
able
to
litigate
it
in
some
other
situation.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
decision
to
the
effect
that
those
books
have
been
declared
obscene,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
injunction
would
only
apply
to
those
people
who
were
brought
into
court
as
parties
or
who
were
served
with
notice.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
no,
sir.
this
is
fairly
recent.
i
don’t
know.
i
can
--
i
don’t
--
it’s
not
within
the
last
two
or
three
years,
but
i
think
it
was
in
1960
if
i’m
not
mistaken,
somewhere
along
that
time.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
yes,
sir.
in
a
notice
on
page
19
(a)
that
the
statute
was
--
on
22
(a),
was
enacted
a
chapter
233
of
the
acts
presumed
at
1960.
as
to
the
community
standards,
the
first
amendment,
in
clear
language,
states
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
press.
there’s
no
specific
mention
of
the
states
in
this
amendment
and
the
freedom
of
speech
has
been
made
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
therefore,
what
the
states
may
constitutionally
do
in
this
area
must
be
judged
upon
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
not
upon
the
language
of
the
first
amendment.
the
question
arises
as
how
would
a
national
standard
be
determined?
would
each
locality
have
to
have
its
own
set
of
“experts”
to
go
around
the
country
in
order
to
ascertain
what
material
is
acceptable?
how
many
people
would
be
required
to
be
interviewed?
would
they
be
required
to
go
into
the
rural
areas
as
well
as
to
the
large
metropolitan
areas?
if
a
national
standard
is
required,
we
will
be
relegated
to
the
type
expert
which
the
appellants
presented
in
this
case.
it
appears
that
this
dr.
hamlin,
who
was
in
the
georgia
case,
also
appeared
in
this
case.
we
get
experts
from
out
of
state
who
come
into
town
on
the
day
of
the
trial
and,
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
they
spent
no
more
than
10
or
15
minutes
thumbing
through
not
more
than
half
of
the
books
which
were
involved
in
this
case
and
then
making
their
opinions
known
to
the
court.
we
compare
this
to
what
the
state
experts
did
on
the
other
hand.
these
people
are
all
local
people.
they
had
examined
each
book
thoroughly.
they
had
knowledge
of
what
the
customs
were
and
what
the
community
standards
were
in
portsmouth,
virginia,
and
as
former
chief
justice
warren
said
in
jacobellis,
he
said
he
didn’t
believe
that
there
was
a
provable
standard
and
that
this
court
had
not
been
able
to
annunciate
one,
and
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
the
local
courts
to
define
one.
as
this
court
said
in
missouri
versus
lewis,
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
profess
to
secure
all
persons
in
the
united
states
to
benefit
the
same
laws
and
the
same
remedies.
great
diversities,
in
this
respect,
may
exist
in
two
states,
separated
only
by
an
imaginary
line.
when
we
get
to
the
question
which
this
court
asked
counsel
to
brief
and
argue,
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
the
display
of
any
sexually
oriented
pictorial
magazines
for
commercial
sale
were
surrounded
by
notice
to
the
public
of
that
nature
and
by
reasonable
protection
against
exposure
of
the
magazines
to
juveniles,
the
answer,
i
believe,
to
this
question
depends
upon
whether
we’re
talking
about
sexually
oriented
pictorial
magazines
which
are
obscene.
if
the
magazines
are,
in
fact,
obscene,
then
there
is
not
constitutional
protection
for
the
reason
that
in
roth
this
court
held
that
obscenity
was
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech.
this
question
was
clearly
answered,
i
believe,
in
the
negative
in
united
states
versus
reidel
decided
in
may
of
last
year.
in
reidel,
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
whether
the
government
could
constitutionally
prohibit
the
distribution
by
the
mails
of
obscene
materials
to
willing
recipients
who
state
that
they
are
adults.
to
which
question,
this
court
responded
by
holding
that
the
government
could
prohibit
discrimination
of
obscene
material
through
the
mails.
this
court
expressly
rejected
the
argument
that
stanley,
somehow,
limited
roth
and
that
the
state
and
federal
governments
were
constitutionally
limited
to
prohibiting
distribution
of
obscene
materials
to
juveniles
and
unconsenting
adults.
stanley
recognized
that
the
states
retain
broad
powers
to
regulate
obscenity.
there’s
being
a
espouse
to
proposition
that
since
the
president’s
commission
on
obscenity
found
no
cause
of
relationship
between
pornography
in
any
social
conduct
and
sex
crimes,
then
the
states
have
no
interest
in
protecting
consenting
adults
from
pornography.
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
that
this
argument
completely
takes
away
from
the
states
the
right
to
reject
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
president’s
commission.
the
commission’s
report
has
not
only
been
rejected
by
the
president,
by
the
senate,
it
has
been
criticized
by
the
scholars.
the
commission’s
study
did
not
explore
the
long
range
effects
of
frequent
exposure
to
the
obscene.
at
the
time
the
commission
was
concluding
that
public
opinion
did
not
support
any
legal
restrictions
on
the
right
of
adults
to
read
or
view
explicit
sexual
material,
the
gallup
opinion
index
found
80%
of
the
adult
population
bearing
stricter
laws
on
pornography
and
a
harris
poll,
at
the
same
time,
found
76%
of
the
population
want
pornography
legislature
--
literature
outlawed.
the
commission
also
reported
that
in
copenhagen,
the
rape
--
a
reported
rape
declined
during
the
period
in
which
pornography
has
been
widely
available.
therefore,
the
commission
concluded
that
there
was
no
cause
or
connection
between
sex
crimes
and
pornography.
however,
the
commission
completely
dismissed
the
fact
that,
in
this
country,
adult
arrest
or
forceful
rapes
increased
50%
in
the
last
decade
when
the
availability
of
erotic
material
also
increased.
the
obscenity
report
published
by
stein
&
day
publishers
in
1970
found
evidence
of
a
demonstrable
correlation
between
rising
obscenity
statistics
and
rising
crime
rates.
within
the
last
few
weeks,
a
british
study
found
that
british
society
was
threatened
by
the
growth
of
pornography.
commonsense
does
suggest
that
if
good
literature
can
ennoble
its
readers,
fowl
literature
can
degrade
them
and
that
to
depersonalize
and
derational
--
romanticize
sex
may
be
damaging
and
certainly
cannot
be
helpful
to
the
development
of
happy
human
relationships.
the
people
who
are
presently
saying
that
a
book
does
not
corrupt
are
the
very
same
ones
who
seemed
convinced
that
displays
of
violence
on
television
do
indeed
have
the
power
to
corrupt.
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
is
that
in
the
question
of
the
area
of
obscenity
that
this
court
has
specifically
held
in
roth
and
reiterated
in
stanley
and
reiterated
once
again
in
reidel
and
37
photographs
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
while
it
may
true,
and
while
it
may
be
proven
true
at
some
time,
that
certain
areas
in
this
law
should
be
changed.
it’s
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
that
this
matter
rests
in
the
hands
of
the
legislature.
and,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment.
mr.
james
e.
kulp
i
believe
i
might
be
able
to
answer
that
right
now.
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
no
statute
which
authorizes
the
permanent
injunction,
which
the
court
declared
in
this
case,
but
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
its
decision
which
is
shown
on
page
2
(a)
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
held
that
if
the
material
is
judged
to
be
obscene,
then
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
restrain
its
sale
or
distribution.
so,
this
is
the
statutory
construction
put
on
it
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
