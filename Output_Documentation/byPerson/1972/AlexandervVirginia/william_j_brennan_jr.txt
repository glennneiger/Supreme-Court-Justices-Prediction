justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
dietz,
my
recollection
of
roth
was
that
the
concession
was
that
the
materials
involved
were
obscene,
whether
hardcore
or
what,
it
wasn’t
suggested.
we
didn’t
even
have
the
exhibits
here,
and
the
concession
i
think
is,
as
it
appears
in
the
footnote
in
roth,
simply
that
the
materials
there
involved
were
obscene
and
that
concession
was
made
to
present
the
question
whether
obscenity
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and,
you
keep
talking
about
hardcore
pornography.
i
thought
that
was,
i
think,
a
phrase
that
came
in
much
later.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
don’t
find
the
words
“hardcore
pornography”
anywhere
in
the
opinion,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
nothing
about
it.
we
had
no
exhibits
here
in
that
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
that’s
a
different
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kulp,
when
the
state
prevails
in
one
of
these
proceedings,
what
happens
to
the
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
had
interrupted,
what,
339
different
books
involved
in
this
case?

photographs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
says
at
page
19
(a),
the
order
of
the
court
below
was
in
accordance
with
its
findings
that
the
magazines
listed
are
declared
obscene
and
the
said
alexander
collier
and
village
books
inc.
media
arts
and
guild
quest
limited
are
hereby
restraint
from
either
the
sale
or
commercial
disposition
of
the
forementioned
magazines.
that’s
the
order
before
us,
isn’t
it?
