chief

warren
e.
burger
but
since
the

is
on
the

statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
kelsaw
case
now
takes
care
of
the

with
respect
to

relevant
in

warren
e.
burger
mr.
gillette.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn’t
williams
–
didn’t
the

of

warren
e.
burger
mr.

is
it
customary
to
adjourn
a
trial
criminal
trial
more
than
24-48
hours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
trial
court’s
memo
or
the

chief

warren
e.
burger
could
you
--
under

e.
burger
yes.

or
by
some
provision
of

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
but
it’s
something
that
jury
--
they
do
see
the
alibi
witness
ultimately
and
your
point
is
that
it
would
be
a
testimonial
to
develop
the
fact
that,
that
was
a
late
tactic.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
--
then
i
take
it
too
that
if
the
prosecutor
got
up
and
objected
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
belated
tender,
he’d
be
in
the
same
trouble?
