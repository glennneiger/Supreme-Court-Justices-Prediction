mr.
w.
michael
gillette
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
questions
have
arisen
this
morning
with
respect
to
oregon
procedure
and
i
should
like
for
a
moment
if
i
may
to
attempt
to
clarify
little
further
for
justice
brennan,
the
present
status
of
oregon
law
with
respect
to
discovery.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
general
discovery
statute
in
oregon
with
respect
to
the
right
to
criminal
defendant.
and
included
in
that,
there
is
no
right
to
a
bill
of
particulars
as
the
law
now
stands.
i
believe
that
after
the
legislatures
concluded
its
work
at
the
present
time
there
will
be
one
but
there
is
not
at
the
moment.
the
kelsaw
case
represents
really
the
first
major
step
by
any
oregon
court
of
appeals
whether
the
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
to
establish
any
right
of
discovery
on
the
part
of
the
criminal
defendants.
in
that
case
only
goes
as
far
as
it
does
i
believe
because
that’s
all
it
was
called
to
do
in
that
particular
case.
now,
it
establishes
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
refuse
to
comply
with
the
alibi
statute
unless
that
the
defendant
is
in
possession
at
the
time
the
compliance
is
called
for.
it
is
in
the
possession
of
information
supplied
by
the
state
which
tells
him
the
time,
the
date
in
which
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
occurred
and
a
place
where
it
is
alleged
to
have
occurred.
and
this
ruling
is
made
on
the
basis
of
a
theory
of
fundamental
fairness
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
disclosing
that
he
was
at
place
“x”
until
he
knows
that
he’s
charged
of
having
been
at
place
“y.”
now,
the
court
of
appeals
went
no
further
because
there
was
no
need
in
the
kelsaw
case.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no
sir,
there
was
not.
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
an
appropriate
case
where
the
defendant
applied
at
the
time
he
gave
the
notice
applied
for
in
order
from
the
court
requiring
the
state
to
disclose
to
the
defendant
the
names
of
any
witnesses
it
propose
to
call
and
rebuttal
to
his
alibi
testimony
their
names
and
addresses
and
so
on
that
he
would
be
granted
that.
and
i
think
that
would
be
called
for
on
a
basis
of
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
versus
florida.
the
point
is
the
oregon
courts
have
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
deal
with
this
question
and
when
they
are
given
the
chance
to
deal
with
this
question,
i
believe
they’ll
deal
with
it
in
the
same
way
they
dealt
with
the
kelsaw
problem.
they’ll
analyze
it,
they’ll
take
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
and
they’ll
apply
it.
and
one
of
the
points
that
i
want
to
urge
upon
the
court
this
morning
is
that
state
courts
in
general
and
the
oregon
courts
in
particular
are
capable
of
taking
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court
and
applying
to
them
to
their
own
statute
and
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir
it
has,
and
it’s
been
denied.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
they
have.
those
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
those
cases
were
decided
prior
to
williams
and
i
am
speaking
only
with
respect
to
what
is
meant
to
happen
under
notice
of
alibi
case.
i
am
not
trying
to
suggest
that
in
general,
defendants
are
going
to
be
granted
broad
discovery
powers
but
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
the
rational
of
alibi
statute,
as
i
understand
them
and
as
i
believe
they
are
explained
in
the
williams
case,
is
that
the
alibi
defense
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
defense
it
offers
opportunities
for
surprise
that
the
general
defense
does
not.
and
the
state
has
a
special
interest
in
avoiding
the
kind
of
surprise
that
an
alibi
defense
represents.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
an
alibi
is
just
as
surprising
when
the
defendant
raises
it
by
himself
as
when
he
calls
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
call
witnesses
to
show
that
either
the
defendant
was
somewhere
else
or
call
witnesses
who
were
at
this
place
where
the
defendant
claims
to
have
been
to
show
that
he
wasn’t
there.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
think
you’re
right.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
sir.
this
statute
does
not
interfere
with
the
defendant’s
ability
to
take
any
position
to
trial.
there
is
no
authorization
in
this
statute.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
i
am
sorry
perhaps
i
miss
understand
your
question.
as
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
you
are
suggesting
that
his
disclosure
of
his
intention
that
for
evidence
of
alibi
binds
him
to
that
defense.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
oh!
alright,
yes
sir
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
he
is
not.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
don’t
think
it
interferes
with
his
right
to
testify
if
during
the
time
limit
provided
by
the
statute
prior
to
trial
he
was
aware
on
it,
informed
his
counsel
of
the
fact
that
he
had
alibi
testimony
to
offer.
if
he
kept
that
information
to
himself
and
did
not
tell
his
counsel
until
the
case
it
actually
proceeded
and
he
finally
--
and
this
happens.
i
am
told
by
colleagues
who
are
in
the
defense
business.
if
he
finally
after
the
trial
has
proceeded,
first
turned
to
his
counsel
and
says,
“look,
i
will
now
tell
you
what
i
was
doing,
i
was
with
a
girlfriend
somewhere
and
i
didn’t
want
to
bring
her
name
up
but
the
case
is
going
badly
and
i
have
obviously
got
to.”
if
that
occurred,
i
think
that
would
constitute
good
cause
for
the
waiver
of
the
alibi
notice.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
there’s
not.
not
one
way
or
the
other
at
this
point.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
if
you’re
saying
that
we’re
dealing
with
an
absolute
right
to
testify,
then
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
said
that.
i
think
that’s
the
issue
before
the
court.
is
the
right
absolute
or
can
it
be
qualified
by
writ
of
requirement
of
disclosure?
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right,
we
wouldn’t.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
i
think
the
williams’
holdings
settled
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
notice
of
alibi
is
constitutional.
i
thought
that
was
settled.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir.
but
only
against
of
fifth
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right.
neither
the
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
neither
the
two
parties.
neither
the
issue
as
to
the
defendant
himself
in
all
the
issue
of
the
exclusion
of
the
testimony
was
before
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
if
that’s
the
way
i
understood
the
case,
yes
sir.
now,
i’d
like
to
make
one
more
point
with
respect
to
oregon
procedure
if
i
can
return
to
that
for
the
moment.
a
question
arose
from
one
of
the
justices
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist
with
respect
to
rebuttal
testimony.
i
--
perhaps
i
have
already
finished
that
statement
but
i
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
that
information.
information
which
the
georgia
statute
or
the
florida
statute,
pardon
me,
called
for
with
respect
to
the
names,
addresses,
nature
of
the
testimony
from
the
rebuttal
witnesses.
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
is
entitled
that’s
not
settled
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conclusion
of
the
oregon
courts
would
have
to
reach
this,
pretty
well
dictated
by
the
language
of
williams.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
at
the
very
least
it
would
be
the
value
for
the
oregon
courts
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
settle
that
question
on
their
own
based
upon
an
appropriate
motion
by
the
defense.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
sir
i
really
don’t.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
feel
the
entire
context
to
that
argument
which
mr.
kuhn
and
i
made
was
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
was
constitutional
as
applied
in
that
case
and
there
was
no
real
issue
on
constitutionality
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
really
don’t
think
it
is.
i
really
think
the
court
is
faced
here
with
the
question
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
applied.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
it
is
the
same
interest
that’s
referred
to
in
the
williams
case.
the
alibi
defense
is
one
which
involves
--
usually
involves
surprise
to
the
state
because
it
develops
the
testimony
in
an
entirely
new
line.
the
testimony
for
the
prosecution
goes
whether
the
defendant
was
in
certain
place
where
they
perform
certain
acts.
the
alibi
testimony
gives
a
right
turn
to
the
entire
proceedings.
it
is
surprising
by
definition.
and
the
interest
as
referred
to
in
williams
is
the
interest
of
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
all
the
issues
which
go
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
think
the
concern
their
shifts.
the
concern
then
becomes
concluding
the
business
of
that
particular
trial
particularly
in
jury
section
with
crowded
dockets
without
being
faced
with
an
arbitrary
really
is
surprising
delay
due
to
the
fact
the
defendant
did
not
make
a
disclosure
at
a
time
when
he
was
aware
they
could
have
made
it.
let
me
put
this
way,
let’s
supposed
that
the
matter
is
being
tried
for
at
jury.
now,
this
case
was
not
but
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
whatever
the
court
decides
that
they
will
apply
to
both
trials
to
juries
and
trials
to
the
court.
if
the
case
is
being
tried
to
a
jury
and
the
jury
spent
about
two
weeks
hearing
testimony
in
a
relatively
complicated
criminal
matter
and
the
defense
for
the
first
time
at
the
end
of
those
weeks
discloses
that
they
intend
to
offer
evidence
of
alibi
and
they
make
available,
let’s
say
the
names
of
four
or
five
witnesses
and
the
state
has
then
granted
a
continuance.
you’re
asking
a
jury
which
could
be
used
under
other
circumstance
to
hear
other
cases
in
the
panel
of
a
(inaudible)
frequently
is
limited
in
jurisdictions
such
as
the
one
i
came
from
in
portland.
you
are
asking
that
jury
to
sit
on
its
hands
until
the
state
has
concluded
its
investigation.
they
can’t
be
assigned
in
any
other
case
because
they
may
not
be
available
to
reconvene
the
trial.
you
are
asking
that
the
judge
be
made
available.
you
are
asking
that
those
things
occur,
those
delays
occur
which
could
have
been
avoided
by
supplying
information
ahead
of
time.
you
are
asking
that
the
judicial
system,
the
system
were
trying
to
take
care
of
crowded
dockets
be
interrupted
by
that
period
of
time.
now,
it’s
easier
with
the
judge
and
with
the
jury.
it’s
much
more
complicated
with
the
jury
because
they
ought
to
be
[voice
overlap].
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir.
they’ll
do
what
they’re
told.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
i
think
that’s
what
would
be
done.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
the
ellsberg
case
[voice
overlap]
a
long
time.
that’s
true
i
had
to
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
can
only
suggest
to
the
court
based
upon
my
own
limited
experience
that
it
is
impractical
to
adjourn
matters
like
that
for
any
extended
length
of
time.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
think
it’s
impossible
to
identify
the
period
of
time.
i
think
10
days
are
too
long
but
i
have
no
[voice
overlap]
period
time
will
do.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
five
days
prior
to
trial.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
what
the
statute
apparently
it
arises.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
unless
they
find
witnesses
they
have
to
give
notice
to
the
defendant
to
who
in
which
case
i
assume
he
is
entitled
longer.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
it’s
not.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
16
states
have
them.
so
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
just
less
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
am
not
sure
the
exact
number
i
think
five
or
six.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that
is
right.
some
of
them
have
a
specific
exemption
with
respect
to
the
defendant.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
some
of
them
do
not
provide
for
exclusion
in
any
case
the
statute
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
sometimes
the
continuants,
in
fact
i
think
the
continuance
is
usually
the
sanction
imposed.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
the
statutes
are
a
classic
example
of
various
states
experimenting
with
the
procedures.
and
in
fact,
the
oregon
statute
as
i
recall
is
the
most
recent
to
this
statute.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
it
is
not
the
1969
makes
it
for
more
recent
in
the
majority
of
them
which
were
enacted
during
the
30’s.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
we
didn’t?
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
oregon
law
requires
that
the
issue
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
either
on
its
face
or
as
implied
be
raise
in
the
trial
court
and
that
the
record
be
made
of
that
and
it
is
becomes
the
designated
matters
on
field.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
the
matter
in
which
this
whole
question
came
up
is
set
out
at
length
in
the
appendix
and
i
think
it’s
of
some
significance.
what
occurred
was
--
this
trial
happen
about
two
or
three
months
after
this
court’s
decision
williams
versus
florida.
and
it’s
--
i
think
it’s
evident
from
the
transcript
if
you
examine
it
in
the
appendix
that
the
trial
court
was
aware
neither
of
the
alibi
statute
nor
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
so
that
both
of
those
things
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
trial
court.
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant
was
aware
both
of
them
because
as
the
transcript
shows
the
defense
counsel
gave
a
copy
of
the
williams
decision
to
the
prosecutor
during
the
noon
recess.
and
he
came
in
the
afternoon
and
put
on
the
proceeded
put
on
his
alibi
testimony
which
was
well
the
only
testimony
offered
by
the
defense.
and
the
first
time,
the
court
was
aware
that
there
was
an
alibi
statute
or
there
was
a
problem
with
an
alibi
statute
was
when
the
prosecution
entered
in
objection.
so,
what
occurred
after
that
is
not
particularly
clear
the
defendant
was
given
an
opportunity
to
make
it
showing
of
good
cause
where
the
requirements
of
statute
should
not
be
waive
--
should
be
waive?
and
his
offering
was
to
the
effect
that
first
he
thought
that
the
date
on
the
indictment
was
wrong
and
he
was
prepared
after
alibi
witnesses
on
a
different
date.
but
of
course
he
had
notice
those
either.
and
then
secondly,
he
also
said
that
he
was
not
aware
the
name
of
his
alibi
witness
and
again
the
transcript
shows
that
even
if
he
was
not
aware
that
his
defendant
was
he
dated
the
girlfriend
of
that
year.
so,
neither
of
those
showings
was
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
describe
any
particular
posture
that
opinion
quite
frankly.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
they
decided
that
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
issue
with
respect
to
whether
requiring
the
disclosure
of
this
constitutional
that,
that
was
proper
under
this
court’s
decision
in
williams.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
it
had
williams
v.
florida,
yes.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
the
courts
of
appeals’
decision.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
they
considered
the
fifth
amendment
issue,
yes.
but
with
respect
to
the
other
issues
we
are
talking
about.
this
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
they
were
not
even
clearly
raised
in
the
trial
court.
the
issue
for
us
is
with
respect
to
the
sanction
to
be
imposed.
it’s
really
not
raise
in
the
trial
court.
there’s
no
discussion
of
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
because
he
says
one
other
thing
in
that
transcript.
he
says
essentially
the
statute
simply
is
not
constitutional
because
of
williams
versus
florida.
he
simply
offered
the
court
the
decision
it
said,
here
is
the
statute
you
can
only
beside
the
other
and
that
is
the
end
of
it
and
i
supposed
in
that
sense
you
could
say
that
the
issue
of
the
constitutionally
of
the
state
[voice
overlap]
raise
was
more
properly
raise
before
the
trial
court
than
on
an
appeal.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
he
was
trying
to
get
out
of
complying
with
the
statute
never
mind
what
the
reason
was
whether
he
had
good
cause
or
not,
even
the
same
statute
was
inapplicable
period.
now
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
unconstitutional.
i
misspoke.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
i
think
the
adjournment
procedure
makes
available
to
the
defendant
that
is
a
close
to
the
states
case
a
period
of
time
in
which
he
can
figure
out
what
to
do.
if
he’s
serious
of
notice
of
alibi
by
which
he
is
not
back,
he
simply
gets
himself
a
five-day
recess
or
whatever
the
period
time
is
and
which
he
can
sit
down
perhaps
even
get
full
transcript
of
all
the
testimony
and
go
over
all
the
testimony
and
plan
what
it
is
he
is
going
to
do.
it
is
a
kind
of
built-in
five-day
delay
in
the
trial
process.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
but
he
doesn’t
have
to.
he
can
conclude
after
the
five-day
recess
if
he
chooses
not
to
offer
the
alibi
testimony.
he
is
not
bound
by
that
in
the
recess.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
there
wouldn’t.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
think
the
answer
is
the
same,
the
fact
that
he
is
called
a
witness
where
in
fact,
i
don’t
think
he
have
to
do
that
i
think
it’s
simply
after
advice
the
court
of
this
time
in
which
t
o
serve
notice
of
alibi.
and
i
think
this
trial
process
of
calling
the
witness
and
not
asking
the
first
question
--
receiving
the
objection
having
the
juries
and
ask
and
giving
[voice
overlap].
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right
and
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
to
the
jury?
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
oh!
i
think
not.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
i
think
it
would
be
precluded
by
oregon
law.
the
courts
of
--
oregon
courts
have
been
rather
severe
about
that
promise
of
the
jury
on
anything
that
is
not
directly
in
evidence
and
that
would
constitute
testifying
as
to
matters
not
an
evidence.
i
think
that
oregon
[voice
overlap].
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
he’d
be
riding
the
same
difficulty
i
think
it
might
well
service
grounds
for
mistrial
at
that
point
if
he
did
it
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
now,
if
i
may
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
finally
refer
to
the
question
of
compulsory
process
which
counsels
referred
to
when
he
specifically
say
that
the
washington
versus
texas
case
and
i
would
submit
that
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
difference
between
the
problem
pose
by
this
case
and
the
line
of
cases
represented
by
washington
versus
texas,
pointer
versus
texas,
ferguson
versus
georgia
and
the
like
is
that
in
those
case
witnesses
were
incompetent
period.
the
statute
made
the
man
available
to
the
defendant
no
matter
what
he
did.
he
simply
could
not
qualify
them
as
witnesses.
washington,
you
may
recall,
involved
a
situation
where
the
defendant
could
not
call
on
accomplice
to
testify
a
co-principal
to
testify
at
all.
he
was
deemed
incompetent
by
texas
statute.
now,
in
this
case
the
only
step
that
the
defendant
needs
to
take
to
make
the
witness
confident
is
to
serve
the
notice.
the
power
to
make
the
witness
confident
lies
within
his
own
hands
and
i
would
submit
that
makes
the
statute
as
applied.
significantly,
different
in
the
entire
line
of
cases
represented
by
washington
versus
texas.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
remarks.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
questions
have
arisen
this
morning
with
respect
to
oregon
procedure
and
i
should
like
for
a
moment
if
i
may
to
attempt
to
clarify
little
further
for
justice
brennan,
the
present
status
of
oregon
law
with
respect
to
discovery.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
general
discovery
statute
in
oregon
with
respect
to
the
right
to
criminal
defendant.
and
included
in
that,
there
is
no
right
to
a
bill
of
particulars
as
the
law
now
stands.
i
believe
that
after
the
legislatures
concluded
its
work
at
the
present
time
there
will
be
one
but
there
is
not
at
the
moment.
the
kelsaw
case
represents
really
the
first
major
step
by
any
oregon
court
of
appeals
whether
the
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
to
establish
any
right
of
discovery
on
the
part
of
the
criminal
defendants.
in
that
case
only
goes
as
far
as
it
does
i
believe
because
that’s
all
it
was
called
to
do
in
that
particular
case.
now,
it
establishes
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
refuse
to
comply
with
the
alibi
statute
unless
that
the
defendant
is
in
possession
at
the
time
the
compliance
is
called
for.
it
is
in
the
possession
of
information
supplied
by
the
state
which
tells
him
the
time,
the
date
in
which
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
occurred
and
a
place
where
it
is
alleged
to
have
occurred.
and
this
ruling
is
made
on
the
basis
of
a
theory
of
fundamental
fairness
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
disclosing
that
he
was
at
place
“x”
until
he
knows
that
he’s
charged
of
having
been
at
place
“y.”
now,
the
court
of
appeals
went
no
further
because
there
was
no
need
in
the
kelsaw
case.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no
sir,
there
was
not.
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
an
appropriate
case
where
the
defendant
applied
at
the
time
he
gave
the
notice
applied
for
in
order
from
the
court
requiring
the
state
to
disclose
to
the
defendant
the
names
of
any
witnesses
it
propose
to
call
and
rebuttal
to
his
alibi
testimony
their
names
and
addresses
and
so
on
that
he
would
be
granted
that.
and
i
think
that
would
be
called
for
on
a
basis
of
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
versus
florida.
the
point
is
the
oregon
courts
have
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
deal
with
this
question
and
when
they
are
given
the
chance
to
deal
with
this
question,
i
believe
they’ll
deal
with
it
in
the
same
way
they
dealt
with
the
kelsaw
problem.
they’ll
analyze
it,
they’ll
take
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
and
they’ll
apply
it.
and
one
of
the
points
that
i
want
to
urge
upon
the
court
this
morning
is
that
state
courts
in
general
and
the
oregon
courts
in
particular
are
capable
of
taking
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court
and
applying
to
them
to
their
own
statute
and
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir
it
has,
and
it’s
been
denied.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
they
have.
those
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
those
cases
were
decided
prior
to
williams
and
i
am
speaking
only
with
respect
to
what
is
meant
to
happen
under
notice
of
alibi
case.
i
am
not
trying
to
suggest
that
in
general,
defendants
are
going
to
be
granted
broad
discovery
powers
but
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
the
rational
of
alibi
statute,
as
i
understand
them
and
as
i
believe
they
are
explained
in
the
williams
case,
is
that
the
alibi
defense
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
defense
it
offers
opportunities
for
surprise
that
the
general
defense
does
not.
and
the
state
has
a
special
interest
in
avoiding
the
kind
of
surprise
that
an
alibi
defense
represents.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
an
alibi
is
just
as
surprising
when
the
defendant
raises
it
by
himself
as
when
he
calls
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
call
witnesses
to
show
that
either
the
defendant
was
somewhere
else
or
call
witnesses
who
were
at
this
place
where
the
defendant
claims
to
have
been
to
show
that
he
wasn’t
there.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
think
you’re
right.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
sir.
this
statute
does
not
interfere
with
the
defendant’s
ability
to
take
any
position
to
trial.
there
is
no
authorization
in
this
statute.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
i
am
sorry
perhaps
i
miss
understand
your
question.
as
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
you
are
suggesting
that
his
disclosure
of
his
intention
that
for
evidence
of
alibi
binds
him
to
that
defense.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
oh!
alright,
yes
sir
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
he
is
not.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
don’t
think
it
interferes
with
his
right
to
testify
if
during
the
time
limit
provided
by
the
statute
prior
to
trial
he
was
aware
on
it,
informed
his
counsel
of
the
fact
that
he
had
alibi
testimony
to
offer.
if
he
kept
that
information
to
himself
and
did
not
tell
his
counsel
until
the
case
it
actually
proceeded
and
he
finally
--
and
this
happens.
i
am
told
by
colleagues
who
are
in
the
defense
business.
if
he
finally
after
the
trial
has
proceeded,
first
turned
to
his
counsel
and
says,
“look,
i
will
now
tell
you
what
i
was
doing,
i
was
with
a
girlfriend
somewhere
and
i
didn’t
want
to
bring
her
name
up
but
the
case
is
going
badly
and
i
have
obviously
got
to.”
if
that
occurred,
i
think
that
would
constitute
good
cause
for
the
waiver
of
the
alibi
notice.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
there’s
not.
not
one
way
or
the
other
at
this
point.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
if
you’re
saying
that
we’re
dealing
with
an
absolute
right
to
testify,
then
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
said
that.
i
think
that’s
the
issue
before
the
court.
is
the
right
absolute
or
can
it
be
qualified
by
writ
of
requirement
of
disclosure?
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right,
we
wouldn’t.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
i
think
the
williams’
holdings
settled
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
notice
of
alibi
is
constitutional.
i
thought
that
was
settled.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir.
but
only
against
of
fifth
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right.
neither
the
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
neither
the
two
parties.
neither
the
issue
as
to
the
defendant
himself
in
all
the
issue
of
the
exclusion
of
the
testimony
was
before
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
if
that’s
the
way
i
understood
the
case,
yes
sir.
now,
i’d
like
to
make
one
more
point
with
respect
to
oregon
procedure
if
i
can
return
to
that
for
the
moment.
a
question
arose
from
one
of
the
justices
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist
with
respect
to
rebuttal
testimony.
i
--
perhaps
i
have
already
finished
that
statement
but
i
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
that
information.
information
which
the
georgia
statute
or
the
florida
statute,
pardon
me,
called
for
with
respect
to
the
names,
addresses,
nature
of
the
testimony
from
the
rebuttal
witnesses.
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
is
entitled
that’s
not
settled
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conclusion
of
the
oregon
courts
would
have
to
reach
this,
pretty
well
dictated
by
the
language
of
williams.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
at
the
very
least
it
would
be
the
value
for
the
oregon
courts
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
settle
that
question
on
their
own
based
upon
an
appropriate
motion
by
the
defense.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
sir
i
really
don’t.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
feel
the
entire
context
to
that
argument
which
mr.
kuhn
and
i
made
was
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
was
constitutional
as
applied
in
that
case
and
there
was
no
real
issue
on
constitutionality
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
really
don’t
think
it
is.
i
really
think
the
court
is
faced
here
with
the
question
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
applied.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
it
is
the
same
interest
that’s
referred
to
in
the
williams
case.
the
alibi
defense
is
one
which
involves
--
usually
involves
surprise
to
the
state
because
it
develops
the
testimony
in
an
entirely
new
line.
the
testimony
for
the
prosecution
goes
whether
the
defendant
was
in
certain
place
where
they
perform
certain
acts.
the
alibi
testimony
gives
a
right
turn
to
the
entire
proceedings.
it
is
surprising
by
definition.
and
the
interest
as
referred
to
in
williams
is
the
interest
of
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
all
the
issues
which
go
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
think
the
concern
their
shifts.
the
concern
then
becomes
concluding
the
business
of
that
particular
trial
particularly
in
jury
section
with
crowded
dockets
without
being
faced
with
an
arbitrary
really
is
surprising
delay
due
to
the
fact
the
defendant
did
not
make
a
disclosure
at
a
time
when
he
was
aware
they
could
have
made
it.
let
me
put
this
way,
let’s
supposed
that
the
matter
is
being
tried
for
at
jury.
now,
this
case
was
not
but
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
whatever
the
court
decides
that
they
will
apply
to
both
trials
to
juries
and
trials
to
the
court.
if
the
case
is
being
tried
to
a
jury
and
the
jury
spent
about
two
weeks
hearing
testimony
in
a
relatively
complicated
criminal
matter
and
the
defense
for
the
first
time
at
the
end
of
those
weeks
discloses
that
they
intend
to
offer
evidence
of
alibi
and
they
make
available,
let’s
say
the
names
of
four
or
five
witnesses
and
the
state
has
then
granted
a
continuance.
you’re
asking
a
jury
which
could
be
used
under
other
circumstance
to
hear
other
cases
in
the
panel
of
a
(inaudible)
frequently
is
limited
in
jurisdictions
such
as
the
one
i
came
from
in
portland.
you
are
asking
that
jury
to
sit
on
its
hands
until
the
state
has
concluded
its
investigation.
they
can’t
be
assigned
in
any
other
case
because
they
may
not
be
available
to
reconvene
the
trial.
you
are
asking
that
the
judge
be
made
available.
you
are
asking
that
those
things
occur,
those
delays
occur
which
could
have
been
avoided
by
supplying
information
ahead
of
time.
you
are
asking
that
the
judicial
system,
the
system
were
trying
to
take
care
of
crowded
dockets
be
interrupted
by
that
period
of
time.
now,
it’s
easier
with
the
judge
and
with
the
jury.
it’s
much
more
complicated
with
the
jury
because
they
ought
to
be
[voice

yes,
sir.
they’ll
do
what
they’re
told.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
i
think
that’s
what
would
be
done.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
the
ellsberg
case
[voice

a
long
time.
that’s
true
i
had
to
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
can
only
suggest
to
the
court
based
upon
my
own
limited
experience
that
it
is
impractical
to
adjourn
matters
like
that
for
any
extended
length
of
time.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
think
it’s
impossible
to
identify
the
period
of
time.
i
think
10
days
are
too
long
but
i
have
no
[voice
overlap]
period
time
will
do.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
five
days
prior
to
trial.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
what
the
statute
apparently
it
arises.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
unless
they
find
witnesses
they
have
to
give
notice
to
the
defendant
to
who
in
which
case
i
assume
he
is
entitled
longer.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
it’s
not.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
16
states
have
them.
so
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
just
less
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
am
not
sure
the
exact
number
i
think
five
or
six.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that
is
right.
some
of
them
have
a
specific
exemption
with
respect
to
the
defendant.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
some
of
them
do
not
provide
for
exclusion
in
any
case
the
statute
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
sometimes
the
continuants,
in
fact
i
think
the
continuance
is
usually
the
sanction
imposed.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
the
statutes
are
a
classic
example
of
various
states
experimenting
with
the
procedures.
and
in
fact,
the
oregon
statute
as
i
recall
is
the
most
recent
to
this
statute.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
it
is
not
the
1969
makes
it
for
more
recent
in
the
majority
of
them
which
were
enacted
during
the
30’s.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
we
didn’t?
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
oregon
law
requires
that
the
issue
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
either
on
its
face
or
as
implied
be
raise
in
the
trial
court
and
that
the
record
be
made
of
that
and
it
is
becomes
the
designated
matters
on
field.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
the
matter
in
which
this
whole
question
came
up
is
set
out
at
length
in
the
appendix
and
i
think
it’s
of
some
significance.
what
occurred
was
--
this
trial
happen
about
two
or
three
months
after
this
court’s
decision
williams
versus
florida.
and
it’s
--
i
think
it’s
evident
from
the
transcript
if
you
examine
it
in
the
appendix
that
the
trial
court
was
aware
neither
of
the
alibi
statute
nor
this
court’s
decision
in
williams
so
that
both
of
those
things
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
trial
court.
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant
was
aware
both
of
them
because
as
the
transcript
shows
the
defense
counsel
gave
a
copy
of
the
williams
decision
to
the
prosecutor
during
the
noon
recess.
and
he
came
in
the
afternoon
and
put
on
the
proceeded
put
on
his
alibi
testimony
which
was
well
the
only
testimony
offered
by
the
defense.
and
the
first
time,
the
court
was
aware
that
there
was
an
alibi
statute
or
there
was
a
problem
with
an
alibi
statute
was
when
the
prosecution
entered
in
objection.
so,
what
occurred
after
that
is
not
particularly
clear
the
defendant
was
given
an
opportunity
to
make
it
showing
of
good
cause
where
the
requirements
of
statute
should
not
be
waive
--
should
be
waive?
and
his
offering
was
to
the
effect
that
first
he
thought
that
the
date
on
the
indictment
was
wrong
and
he
was
prepared
after
alibi
witnesses
on
a
different
date.
but
of
course
he
had
notice
those
either.
and
then
secondly,
he
also
said
that
he
was
not
aware
the
name
of
his
alibi
witness
and
again
the
transcript
shows
that
even
if
he
was
not
aware
that
his
defendant
was
he
dated
the
girlfriend
of
that
year.
so,
neither
of
those
showings
was
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
describe
any
particular
posture
that
opinion
quite
frankly.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
they
decided
that
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
issue
with
respect
to
whether
requiring
the
disclosure
of
this
constitutional
that,
that
was
proper
under
this
court’s
decision
in
williams.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
it
had
williams
v.
florida,
yes.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
the
courts
of
appeals’
decision.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
they
considered
the
fifth
amendment
issue,
yes.
but
with
respect
to
the
other
issues
we
are
talking
about.
this
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
they
were
not
even
clearly
raised
in
the
trial
court.
the
issue
for
us
is
with
respect
to
the
sanction
to
be
imposed.
it’s
really
not
raise
in
the
trial
court.
there’s
no
discussion
of
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
because
he
says
one
other
thing
in
that
transcript.
he
says
essentially
the
statute
simply
is
not
constitutional
because
of
williams
versus
florida.
he
simply
offered
the
court
the
decision
it
said,
here
is
the
statute
you
can
only
beside
the
other
and
that
is
the
end
of
it
and
i
supposed
in
that
sense
you
could
say
that
the
issue
of
the
constitutionally
of
the
state
[voice
overlap]
raise
was
more
properly
raise
before
the
trial
court
than
on
an
appeal.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
he
was
trying
to
get
out
of
complying
with
the
statute
never
mind
what
the
reason
was
whether
he
had
good
cause
or
not,
even
the
same
statute
was
inapplicable
period.
now
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
unconstitutional.
i
misspoke.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
i
think
the
adjournment
procedure
makes
available
to
the
defendant
that
is
a
close
to
the
states
case
a
period
of
time
in
which
he
can
figure
out
what
to
do.
if
he’s
serious
of
notice
of
alibi
by
which
he
is
not
back,
he
simply
gets
himself
a
five-day
recess
or
whatever
the
period
time
is
and
which
he
can
sit
down
perhaps
even
get
full
transcript
of
all
the
testimony
and
go
over
all
the
testimony
and
plan
what
it
is
he
is
going
to
do.
it
is
a
kind
of
built-in
five-day
delay
in
the
trial
process.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
but
he
doesn’t
have
to.
he
can
conclude
after
the
five-day
recess
if
he
chooses
not
to
offer
the
alibi
testimony.
he
is
not
bound
by
that
in
the
recess.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
no,
there
wouldn’t.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
i
think
the
answer
is
the
same,
the
fact
that
he
is
called
a
witness
where
in
fact,
i
don’t
think
he
have
to
do
that
i
think
it’s
simply
after
advice
the
court
of
this
time
in
which
t
o
serve
notice
of
alibi.
and
i
think
this
trial
process
of
calling
the
witness
and
not
asking
the
first
question
--
receiving
the
objection
having
the
juries
and
ask
and
giving
[voice
overlap].
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right
and
--
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
to
the
jury?
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
oh!
i
think
not.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
well,
i
think
it
would
be
precluded
by
oregon
law.
the
courts
of
--
oregon
courts
have
been
rather
severe
about
that
promise
of
the
jury
on
anything
that
is
not
directly
in
evidence
and
that
would
constitute
testifying
as
to
matters
not
an
evidence.
i
think
that
oregon
[voice
overlap].
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
w.
michael
gillette
he’d
be
riding
the
same
difficulty
i
think
it
might
well
service
grounds
for
mistrial
at
that
point
if
he
did
it
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
now,
if
i
may
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
finally
refer
to
the
question
of
compulsory
process
which
counsels
referred
to
when
he
specifically
say
that
the
washington
versus
texas
case
and
i
would
submit
that
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
difference
between
the
problem
pose
by
this
case
and
the
line
of
cases
represented
by
washington
versus
texas,
pointer
versus
texas,
ferguson
versus
georgia
and
the
like
is
that
in
those
case
witnesses
were
incompetent
period.
the
statute
made
the
man
available
to
the
defendant
no
matter
what
he
did.
he
simply
could
not
qualify
them
as
witnesses.
washington,
you
may
recall,
involved
a
situation
where
the
defendant
could
not
call
on
accomplice
to
testify
a
co-principal
to
testify
at
all.
he
was
deemed
incompetent
by
texas
statute.
now,
in
this
case
the
only
step
that
the
defendant
needs
to
take
to
make
the
witness
confident
is
to
serve
the
notice.
the
power
to
make
the
witness
confident
lies
within
his
own
hands
and
i
would
submit
that
makes
the
statute
as
applied.
significantly,
different
in
the
entire
line
of
cases
represented
by
washington
versus
texas.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
remarks.
thank
you,
your
honor.
