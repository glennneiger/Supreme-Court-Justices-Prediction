mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
in
the
instant
case
was
convicted
for
the
sale
of
narcotics
and
sentence
to
18
months
imprisonment.
during
the
trial
of
his
case,
he
was
not
permitted
to
present
alibi
testimony
through
an
alibi
witness
and
his
own
testimony
because
he
felt
comply
with
requirements
of
ors
135.875
oregon’s
notice
of
alibi
statute.
pursuant
to
the
requirements
of
this
statute,
the
defendant
not
less
than
five
days
prior
to
trial
must
file
a
written
intent
of
notice
to
rely
on
alibi
evidence.
the
notice
must
include
within
it
the
place
or
places
the
accused
claim
to
have
been
at
the
time
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed
plus
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
witnesses
he
intends
to
call.
the
sanctions
levied
upon
a
defendant
for
failure
to
comply
that
the
witness
or
witnesses
are
not
allowed
to
testify
as
to
an
alibi
defense
and
under
the
construction
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
the
defendant
himself
is
not
permitted
to
take
the
stand
and
give
testimony
as
to
his
whereabouts
at
the
time
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
in
the
instant
case
both
the
defendants’
prospective
witnesses’
testimony
and
its
own
were
stricken.
now,
petitioners
believes
that
this
oregon
statute
and
as
construed
by
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
is
unconstitutional
and
that
it
denies
him
due
process
of
law
because
it
fails
one
to
provide
any
reciprocity
on
a
part
of
the
state
and
that
it
gives
no
discovery
rights
to
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
if
it
had,
i
believe
he
would
have
been
here,
your
honor
perhaps
not
on
that
issue
but
on
the
other
side.
i
believe
he
would
have
there.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
on
the
alibi
statute,
yes.
the
other
grounds
however
on
the
reciprocity
probably
not,
not
on
that
particular
issue,
no
sir.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
that
what
would
be
left
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
the
oregon
statute
applies
to
the
defendant’s
testimony
and
that
the
requirements
that
he
file
a
written
notice
as
to
his
whereabouts
prior
to
trial
as
a
condition
of
his
taking
the
stand
would
get
us
here.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
was
not
the
trial
attorney
but
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
from
the
record
there
was
no
request.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
would
not
reach
this
issue
because
the
state
did
not
offer
any
rebuttal
evidence.
however,
the
petition
does
appeal
like
that
is
valid
in
this
case
because
the
state
was
not
required
to
offer
any
rebuttal
evidence
because
the
defendant’s
alibi
testimony
was
stricken
from
the
record.
so
there
would
be
no
reason
for
the
state
to
offer
rebuttal
evidence.
that
was
the
reason
given
by
the
oregon
court.
now,
petitioner
also
believes
that
the
statute
denies
due
process
and
that
it
prevents
the
defendant
from
testifying
in
his
own
behalf
if
he
fails
to
give
notice
as
required
by
the
oregon
statute.
also
that
denies
him
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
because
of
the
written
notice
required
as
the
condition
precedent
to
his
taking
the
stand
and
giving
alibi
testimony.
and
that
it
denies
him
his
right
to
the
sixth
amendment
to
rights
of
compulsory
process.
now,
this
court
in
williams
versus
florida
did
uphold
the
alibi
statute
from
the
state
of
florida.
however,
one
of
the
main
bases
as
petitioner
reach
the
case
once
that
florida
did
provide
for
a
liberal
reciprocity
in
their
statute
that
the
oregon
statute
does
not.
under
the
terms
of
the
florida
statute,
both
the
defendant
and
the
state
are
required
to
submit
the
names
of
their
proposed
alibi
witnesses.
the
defendant
for
his
alibi,
the
state
for
any
prospective
rebuttal
witnesses
they
may
wish
to
call.
if
either
party
under
the
florida
statute
failed
to
give
the
required
notice,
that
party
including
the
state
would
not
be
allowed
to
call
their
alibi
witnesses.
the
florida
statute
was
therefore
equal
in
placing
the
duty,
responsibility
as
well
as
the
sanction
equally
among
the
parties
for
failure
to
comply
with
it.
the
oregon
statute
places
the
entire
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
that
requires
nothing
on
the
part
of
the
state.
the
state
has
no
duty
to
disclose
any
rebuttal
witnesses
nor
as
there
any
sanction
applied
against
the
state
for
failure
to
do
so.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
it
may
have
your
honor.
however
i
could
not
answer
that.
however,
a
recent
case
passed
them
down.
the
statute
has
been
further
interpreted.
it
is
cited
in
the
state’s
supplemental
brief
state
versus
kelsaw.
in
that
case,
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
has
recently
held
that
a
defendant
does
not
have
to
require
with
the
oregon
alibi
statute
now,
unless
and
until
the
state
supply
him
with
the
specific
time
and
place
that
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
if
the
state
fails
to
do
this
either
by
way
of
indictment
or
information
relayed
to
the
defendant’s
attorney
by
the
district
attorney.
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
comply
with
the
statute.
however,
i
believe
all
of
that
may
alleviate
the
problems
someone
in
oregon.
i
don’t
believe
it’s
going
to
solve
it
because
once
the
state
has
given
this
information
to
the
defendant.
the
defendant
then
is
in
the
same
boat
that
the
petitioner
here
is
and
that
he
must
then
comply
with
the
statute.
if
he
does
not
comply
with
it,
he
is
not
permitted
to
testify
nor
any
of
his
witness
permitted
to
testify.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
not
because
there
was
no
demand
of
that
may
have
been
included
in
that
they
said
specifically
because
the
state
had
not
offered
any
rebuttal
testimony
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
neither
do
i,
your
honor.
i
don’t
understand
either,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
--
there
was
no
reciprocity
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
unlike
the
florida
statute
in
line
for
his
support.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
oh!
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
it
has
to
be
in
the
same
section
however
oregon
has
no
discovery
at
all.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
it
could
be
by
judicial
decision
that
we
have
taken
one
small
step
towards
that
by
the
recent
decision
in
state
versus
kelsaw
however
naturally
i
do
not
feel
it
not
quite
far
now
and
not
finished
yet.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
well,
a
long
way
i
believe
they
have
as
i
indicated
as
of
now
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
comply
with
the
statute
and
if
the
state
gives
him
specific
time
and
place
of
the
date
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
however,
the
oregon
law
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
a
specific
report.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
we
don’t.
there
are
practically
a
no
discovery
procedures
available
in
oregon
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
indictment.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
indictment
up
until
the
kelsaw
decision
gives
the
date
and
the
county
in
which
the
crime
was
committed.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
state
must
now
tell
them
the
specific
time.
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
approximately
the
date.
the
date
i
believe
is
which
probably
going
to
be
construed
as
well
as
the
specific
place
such
as
an
address.
in
this
case,
they
would
probably
have
alleged
or
given
to
the
defendant
the
specific
house
number
and
location
of
where
the
sale
was
made.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
law
in
oregon
is
and
under
kelsaw
remains
to
be
that
the
state
is
not
bound
by
the
date
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
that
the
defendant
by
filing
a
notice
of
alibi
or
by
claiming
alibi
cannot
make
time
material.
so
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
well,
that
is
it.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
is
it,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
don’t
feel
that
it
aids
the
defendant
or
assist
in
this
problem
very
much
at
all
because
it’s
easy
for
the
state
to
give
this
information
to
the
defendant.
the
defendant
is
then
tried
back
in
other
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
kelsaw
case
held
that
the
defendant
in
oregon
does
not
have
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
oregon
alibi
statute.
if
the
district
attorney
supplies
to
the
defendant
the
specific
time
and
place
where
the
alleged
crime
was
committed
and
that
is
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
if
that
information
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor
correct.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
well,
without
the
reciprocity
provision
which
there
still
would
not
be
under
the
terms
of
the
kelsaw
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor
specifically
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
state
witnesses.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
would
be
--
that
is
what
we
believe
the
florida
statute
indicated
what
was
fair.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
well,
because
if
as
i
read
the
kelsaw
case.
it
only
gives
time
and
place,
that’s
it.
once
the
state
has
furnished
that
we
have
the
alibi
statute
coming
in
to
full
play
again
where
the
defendant
should
he
wish
to
call
alibi
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor
correct.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
then
i
wouldn’t
have
a
case
on
the
reciprocity
issue.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
on
the
reciprocity
issue.
now,
petitioner
also
feels
that
under
the
terms
of
this
oregon
specific
statute
and
as
interpreted
by
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
that
he
has
been
denied
due
process
and
that
he
has
not
been
allowed
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
in
his
own
behalf
because
he
has
failed
to
give
the
state
the
required
notice
specifically
saying
that
where
he
was
at
the
time
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
this
is
made
a
condition
precedent
as
to
taking
the
stand
and
giving
alibi
testimony.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
that
that
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
condition,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
under
a
very
general
due
process
clause
fourteenth
amendment
i
believe
that
it’s
a
denial
of
a
due
process.
now,
i
realize
that
this
court
has
not
held
that
the
defendant
has
and
unfettered
constitutional
right
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
in
his
own
behalf.
however,
petitioner
believes
that
there
should
be
a
right
of
the
defendant
anytime
he
is
charged
with
crime.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
so
with
the
theory
of
it
perhaps
as
to
williams
i
believe
that
williams,
the
defendant
actually
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
testify.
as
well
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
defendant
in
florida
is
exempt
specifically
under
the
terms
of
the
florida
statute
and
that
the
failure
to
file
notice
under
florida
statute
does
not
affect
his
right
to
take
the
stand
and
give
testimony.
in
oregon
does
not
have
that
provision
and
i
believe
that
of
this
court
in
specht
versus
patterson
has
indicated
that
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
has
a
right
to
be
heard,
has
a
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him
the
right
cross-examine
and
the
right
to
offer
evidence
of
his
own.
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
right
to
be
heard
and
to
offer
evidence
of
his
own
must
necessarily
include
the
right
of
the
defendant
himself
to
take
the
stand
so
that
he
make
deal
his
side
of
the
story.
i
think
that
anytime
a
person
is
charged
with
the
crime
he
should
have
this
right.
and
that
the
oregon
statute
unconstitutionally
abridges
his
right
because
it
requires
the
defendant
prior
to
trial
to
tell
the
state
what
his
trial
testimony
is
going
to
be
as
a
condition
precedent
of
his
getting
up
on
the
stand
and
testifying.
i
believe
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
abridgement
of
his
right
to
testify.
both
the
new
york
and
iowa
have
held
that
the
notice
of
alibi
statute
in
those
states
do
not
apply
to
the
defendant
testimony
on
--
of
his,
unlike
oregon.
the
petitioner
feels
that
the
sanction
under
the
oregon
alibi
statute
is
simply
not
justifying
because
the
defendant
is
denied
the
right
to
testify
on
material
issue
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
this
case
and
as
in
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
be
deprive
of
his
liberty.
finally,
not
finally,
i
believe
that
the
defendant’s
right
against
self-incrimination
is
violated
by
the
statute
for
precisely
the
same
grounds
again
in
that
since
the
statute
does
apply
to
a
defendant’s
testimony
and
not
just
witness’
testimony
he
must
tell
the
state
prior
to
trial
what
his
alibi
testimony
is
going
to
be
as
a
condition
precedent
to
his
taking
stand
and
giving
that
testimony.
and
if
it
applied
only
to
the
witnesses
perhaps
there
would
be
no
denial
of
right
against
self-incrimination
as
this
court
held
in
williams
versus
florida.
however,
i
do
believe
that
this
is
a
distinguishing
feature
of
the
oregon
statute
and
this
case
vis-à-vis
the
williams
decision
and
that
the
defendant
in
williams
were
specifically
excluded
from
the
terms
of
that
statute
here
he
is
not.
and
he
must
reveal
his
testimony
prior
to
the
time
of
trial
where
as
the
police
would
have
no
right
to
that
testimony
under
decision
of
this
court
unless
the
defendant
voluntarily
wished
to
waive
his
right
against
silence.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
he
does
not
have
to
take
the
stand,
your
honor
however,
and
the
issue
hasn’t
come
up.
however,
i
am
certain
under
oregon
law
this
could
be
classified
as
an
admission
against
interest
and
could
be
introduce
into
evidence
against
them.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
there
is
no
law.
the
issue
has
never
risen
to
my
knowledge
in
oregon.
and
we
just
do
not
believe
that
the
legislature
should
force
should
be
able
to
force
the
defendant
to
reveal
his
testimony,
alibi
testimony
prior
to
trial
when
the
police
would
have
no
right
to
that
testimony
themselves
unless
the
defendant
voluntarily
wish
the
waive
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
finally,
petition
believes
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
compulsory
process
in
this
case
under
the
terms
of
this
court’s
decision
in
washington
versus
texas
where
the
court
held
that
the
right
to
compulsory
process
was
complaint
terms
the
right
to
present
a
defense
and
it
was
a
fundamental
element
of
a
due
process
of
law.
petitioner
believes
that
here
because
his
witness
was
in
court,
was
physically
able
to
testify
had
knowledge
of
a
material
fact
that
for
the
court
to
strike
her
testimony
was
a
denial
on
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
compulsory
process.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
there
has
been
only
one
and
that’s
the
kelsaw
decision.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
they
ruled
there
that
there
was
not
good
cause.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
however,
i
did
not
--
that
was
not
an
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
good
cause
shown.
the
issue
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
did
indicate
on
that
basis
that
there
was
not
good
cause
here.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
you
honor,
those
are
the
only
the
two
cases
in
state
versus
blake,
however,
it
doesn’t
indicate
and
adds
nothing
new.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
think
that
i
would
probably
tell
the
district
attorney
that
i
was
going
to
have
an
alibi.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor.
however,
whether
there
would
be
an
adjournment
or
not,
well
that
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
if
there
would
be,
although
i
would
probably
offer
no
more
then
the
fact
that
there
would
be
an
alibi
defense
and
not
complying
with
the
remaining
terms
of
the
statute
assuming
we
had
a
statute.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
in
that
case
i
would
see
no
reason
not
to
give
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
if
i
could
obtain
an
agreement
to
get
them
back.
however,
i
would
not
submit
the
defendant’s
testimony
as
to
where
he
was
at
the
time.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
in
the
instant
case
was
convicted
for
the
sale
of
narcotics
and
sentence
to
18
months
imprisonment.
during
the
trial
of
his
case,
he
was
not
permitted
to
present
alibi
testimony
through
an
alibi
witness
and
his
own
testimony
because
he
felt
comply
with
requirements
of
ors
135.875
oregon’s
notice
of
alibi
statute.
pursuant
to
the
requirements
of
this
statute,
the
defendant
not
less
than
five
days
prior
to
trial
must
file
a
written
intent
of
notice
to
rely
on
alibi
evidence.
the
notice
must
include
within
it
the
place
or
places
the
accused
claim
to
have
been
at
the
time
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed
plus
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
witnesses
he
intends
to
call.
the
sanctions
levied
upon
a
defendant
for
failure
to
comply
that
the
witness
or
witnesses
are
not
allowed
to
testify
as
to
an
alibi
defense
and
under
the
construction
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
the
defendant
himself
is
not
permitted
to
take
the
stand
and
give
testimony
as
to
his
whereabouts
at
the
time
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
in
the
instant
case
both
the
defendants’
prospective
witnesses’
testimony
and
its
own
were
stricken.
now,
petitioners
believes
that
this
oregon
statute
and
as
construed
by
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
is
unconstitutional
and
that
it
denies
him
due
process
of
law
because
it
fails
one
to
provide
any
reciprocity
on
a
part
of
the
state
and
that
it
gives
no
discovery
rights
to
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
if
it
had,
i
believe
he
would
have
been
here,
your
honor
perhaps
not
on
that
issue
but
on
the
other
side.
i
believe
he
would
have
there.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
on
the
alibi
statute,
yes.
the
other
grounds
however
on
the
reciprocity
probably
not,
not
on
that
particular
issue,
no
sir.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
that
what
would
be
left
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
the
oregon
statute
applies
to
the
defendant’s
testimony
and
that
the
requirements
that
he
file
a
written
notice
as
to
his
whereabouts
prior
to
trial
as
a
condition
of
his
taking
the
stand
would
get
us
here.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
was
not
the
trial
attorney
but
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
from
the
record
there
was
no
request.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
would
not
reach
this
issue
because
the
state
did
not
offer
any
rebuttal
evidence.
however,
the
petition
does
appeal
like
that
is
valid
in
this
case
because
the
state
was
not
required
to
offer
any
rebuttal
evidence
because
the
defendant’s
alibi
testimony
was
stricken
from
the
record.
so
there
would
be
no
reason
for
the
state
to
offer
rebuttal
evidence.
that
was
the
reason
given
by
the
oregon
court.
now,
petitioner
also
believes
that
the
statute
denies
due
process
and
that
it
prevents
the
defendant
from
testifying
in
his
own
behalf
if
he
fails
to
give
notice
as
required
by
the
oregon
statute.
also
that
denies
him
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
because
of
the
written
notice
required
as
the
condition
precedent
to
his
taking
the
stand
and
giving
alibi
testimony.
and
that
it
denies
him
his
right
to
the
sixth
amendment
to
rights
of
compulsory
process.
now,
this
court
in
williams
versus
florida
did
uphold
the
alibi
statute
from
the
state
of
florida.
however,
one
of
the
main
bases
as
petitioner
reach
the
case
once
that
florida
did
provide
for
a
liberal
reciprocity
in
their
statute
that
the
oregon
statute
does
not.
under
the
terms
of
the
florida
statute,
both
the
defendant
and
the
state
are
required
to
submit
the
names
of
their
proposed
alibi
witnesses.
the
defendant
for
his
alibi,
the
state
for
any
prospective
rebuttal
witnesses
they
may
wish
to
call.
if
either
party
under
the
florida
statute
failed
to
give
the
required
notice,
that
party
including
the
state
would
not
be
allowed
to
call
their
alibi
witnesses.
the
florida
statute
was
therefore
equal
in
placing
the
duty,
responsibility
as
well
as
the
sanction
equally
among
the
parties
for
failure
to
comply
with
it.
the
oregon
statute
places
the
entire
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
that
requires
nothing
on
the
part
of
the
state.
the
state
has
no
duty
to
disclose
any
rebuttal
witnesses
nor
as
there
any
sanction
applied
against
the
state
for
failure
to
do
so.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
it
may
have
your
honor.
however
i
could
not
answer
that.
however,
a
recent
case
passed
them
down.
the
statute
has
been
further
interpreted.
it
is
cited
in
the
state’s
supplemental
brief
state
versus
kelsaw.
in
that
case,
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
has
recently
held
that
a
defendant
does
not
have
to
require
with
the
oregon
alibi
statute
now,
unless
and
until
the
state
supply
him
with
the
specific
time
and
place
that
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
if
the
state
fails
to
do
this
either
by
way
of
indictment
or
information
relayed
to
the
defendant’s
attorney
by
the
district
attorney.
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
comply
with
the
statute.
however,
i
believe
all
of
that
may
alleviate
the
problems
someone
in
oregon.
i
don’t
believe
it’s
going
to
solve
it
because
once
the
state
has
given
this
information
to
the
defendant.
the
defendant
then
is
in
the
same
boat
that
the
petitioner
here
is
and
that
he
must
then
comply
with
the
statute.
if
he
does
not
comply
with
it,
he
is
not
permitted
to
testify
nor
any
of
his
witness
permitted
to
testify.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
not
because
there
was
no
demand
of
that
may
have
been
included
in
that
they
said
specifically
because
the
state
had
not
offered
any
rebuttal
testimony
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
neither
do
i,
your
honor.
i
don’t
understand
either,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
--
there
was
no
reciprocity
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
unlike
the
florida
statute
in
line
for
his
support.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
oh!
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
it
has
to
be
in
the
same
section
however
oregon
has
no
discovery
at
all.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
it
could
be
by
judicial
decision
that
we
have
taken
one
small
step
towards
that
by
the
recent
decision
in
state
versus
kelsaw
however
naturally
i
do
not
feel
it
not
quite
far
now
and
not
finished
yet.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
well,
a
long
way
i
believe
they
have
as
i
indicated
as
of
now
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
comply
with
the
statute
and
if
the
state
gives
him
specific
time
and
place
of
the
date
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
however,
the
oregon
law
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
a
specific
report.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
we
don’t.
there
are
practically
a
no
discovery
procedures
available
in
oregon
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
indictment.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
indictment
up
until
the
kelsaw
decision
gives
the
date
and
the
county
in
which
the
crime
was
committed.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
state
must
now
tell
them
the
specific
time.
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
approximately
the
date.
the
date
i
believe
is
which
probably
going
to
be
construed
as
well
as
the
specific
place
such
as
an
address.
in
this
case,
they
would
probably
have
alleged
or
given
to
the
defendant
the
specific
house
number
and
location
of
where
the
sale
was
made.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
law
in
oregon
is
and
under
kelsaw
remains
to
be
that
the
state
is
not
bound
by
the
date
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
that
the
defendant
by
filing
a
notice
of
alibi
or
by
claiming
alibi
cannot
make
time
material.
so
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
well,
that
is
it.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
is
it,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
don’t
feel
that
it
aids
the
defendant
or
assist
in
this
problem
very
much
at
all
because
it’s
easy
for
the
state
to
give
this
information
to
the
defendant.
the
defendant
is
then
tried
back
in
other
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
kelsaw
case
held
that
the
defendant
in
oregon
does
not
have
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
oregon
alibi
statute.
if
the
district
attorney
supplies
to
the
defendant
the
specific
time
and
place
where
the
alleged
crime
was
committed
and
that
is
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
if
that
information
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor
correct.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
well,
without
the
reciprocity
provision
which
there
still
would
not
be
under
the
terms
of
the
kelsaw
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor
specifically
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
state
witnesses.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
would
be
--
that
is
what
we
believe
the
florida
statute
indicated
what
was
fair.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
well,
because
if
as
i
read
the
kelsaw
case.
it
only
gives
time
and
place,
that’s
it.
once
the
state
has
furnished
that
we
have
the
alibi
statute
coming
in
to
full
play
again
where
the
defendant
should
he
wish
to
call
alibi
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor
correct.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
then
i
wouldn’t
have
a
case
on
the
reciprocity
issue.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
on
the
reciprocity
issue.
now,
petitioner
also
feels
that
under
the
terms
of
this
oregon
specific
statute
and
as
interpreted
by
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
that
he
has
been
denied
due
process
and
that
he
has
not
been
allowed
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
in
his
own
behalf
because
he
has
failed
to
give
the
state
the
required
notice
specifically
saying
that
where
he
was
at
the
time
the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
this
is
made
a
condition
precedent
as
to
taking
the
stand
and
giving
alibi
testimony.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
that
that
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
condition,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
under
a
very
general
due
process
clause
fourteenth
amendment
i
believe
that
it’s
a
denial
of
a
due
process.
now,
i
realize
that
this
court
has
not
held
that
the
defendant
has
and
unfettered
constitutional
right
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
in
his
own
behalf.
however,
petitioner
believes
that
there
should
be
a
right
of
the
defendant
anytime
he
is
charged
with
crime.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
so
with
the
theory
of
it
perhaps
as
to
williams
i
believe
that
williams,
the
defendant
actually
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
testify.
as
well
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
defendant
in
florida
is
exempt
specifically
under
the
terms
of
the
florida
statute
and
that
the
failure
to
file
notice
under
florida
statute
does
not
affect
his
right
to
take
the
stand
and
give
testimony.
in
oregon
does
not
have
that
provision
and
i
believe
that
of
this
court
in
specht
versus
patterson
has
indicated
that
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
has
a
right
to
be
heard,
has
a
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him
the
right
cross-examine
and
the
right
to
offer
evidence
of
his
own.
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
right
to
be
heard
and
to
offer
evidence
of
his
own
must
necessarily
include
the
right
of
the
defendant
himself
to
take
the
stand
so
that
he
make
deal
his
side
of
the
story.
i
think
that
anytime
a
person
is
charged
with
the
crime
he
should
have
this
right.
and
that
the
oregon
statute
unconstitutionally
abridges
his
right
because
it
requires
the
defendant
prior
to
trial
to
tell
the
state
what
his
trial
testimony
is
going
to
be
as
a
condition
precedent
of
his
getting
up
on
the
stand
and
testifying.
i
believe
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
abridgement
of
his
right
to
testify.
both
the
new
york
and
iowa
have
held
that
the
notice
of
alibi
statute
in
those
states
do
not
apply
to
the
defendant
testimony
on
--
of
his,
unlike
oregon.
the
petitioner
feels
that
the
sanction
under
the
oregon
alibi
statute
is
simply
not
justifying
because
the
defendant
is
denied
the
right
to
testify
on
material
issue
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
this
case
and
as
in
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
be
deprive
of
his
liberty.
finally,
not
finally,
i
believe
that
the
defendant’s
right
against
self-incrimination
is
violated
by
the
statute
for
precisely
the
same
grounds
again
in
that
since
the
statute
does
apply
to
a
defendant’s
testimony
and
not
just
witness’
testimony
he
must
tell
the
state
prior
to
trial
what
his
alibi
testimony
is
going
to
be
as
a
condition
precedent
to
his
taking
stand
and
giving
that
testimony.
and
if
it
applied
only
to
the
witnesses
perhaps
there
would
be
no
denial
of
right
against
self-incrimination
as
this
court
held
in
williams
versus
florida.
however,
i
do
believe
that
this
is
a
distinguishing
feature
of
the
oregon
statute
and
this
case
vis-à-vis
the
williams
decision
and
that
the
defendant
in
williams
were
specifically
excluded
from
the
terms
of
that
statute
here
he
is
not.
and
he
must
reveal
his
testimony
prior
to
the
time
of
trial
where
as
the
police
would
have
no
right
to
that
testimony
under
decision
of
this
court
unless
the
defendant
voluntarily
wished
to
waive
his
right
against
silence.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
he
does
not
have
to
take
the
stand,
your
honor
however,
and
the
issue
hasn’t
come
up.
however,
i
am
certain
under
oregon
law
this
could
be
classified
as
an
admission
against
interest
and
could
be
introduce
into
evidence
against
them.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
there
is
no
law.
the
issue
has
never
risen
to
my
knowledge
in
oregon.
and
we
just
do
not
believe
that
the
legislature
should
force
should
be
able
to
force
the
defendant
to
reveal
his
testimony,
alibi
testimony
prior
to
trial
when
the
police
would
have
no
right
to
that
testimony
themselves
unless
the
defendant
voluntarily
wish
the
waive
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
finally,
petition
believes
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
compulsory
process
in
this
case
under
the
terms
of
this
court’s
decision
in
washington
versus
texas
where
the
court
held
that
the
right
to
compulsory
process
was
complaint
terms
the
right
to
present
a
defense
and
it
was
a
fundamental
element
of
a
due
process
of
law.
petitioner
believes
that
here
because
his
witness
was
in
court,
was
physically
able
to
testify
had
knowledge
of
a
material
fact
that
for
the
court
to
strike
her
testimony
was
a
denial
on
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
compulsory
process.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
there
has
been
only
one
and
that’s
the
kelsaw
decision.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
they
ruled
there
that
there
was
not
good
cause.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
however,
i
did
not
--
that
was
not
an
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
good
cause
shown.
the
issue
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
did
indicate
on
that
basis
that
there
was
not
good
cause
here.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
you
honor,
those
are
the
only
the
two
cases
in
state
versus
blake,
however,
it
doesn’t
indicate
and
adds
nothing
new.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
think
that
i
would
probably
tell
the
district
attorney
that
i
was
going
to
have
an
alibi.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor.
however,
whether
there
would
be
an
adjournment
or
not,
well
that
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
if
there
would
be,
although
i
would
probably
offer
no
more
then
the
fact
that
there
would
be
an
alibi
defense
and
not
complying
with
the
remaining
terms
of
the
statute
assuming
we
had
a
statute.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
in
that
case
i
would
see
no
reason
not
to
give
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
if
i
could
obtain
an
agreement
to
get
them
back.
however,
i
would
not
submit
the
defendant’s
testimony
as
to
where
he
was
at
the
time.
