mr.
justice
bernnan
if
it
had,
would
you
be
here?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
not
on
the
attack
on
the
alibi
statute?
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
would
be
left,
if
this
provided
reciprocity?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
might
clear
mr.
kuhn.
is
your
present
argument
the
omission
of
any
reciprocity
provision?
is
this
an
argument
on
the
face
of
the
statute?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
and
yet
your
court
of
appeals
says
as
you
said
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
earlier
refuse
to
reach
the
question
since
there’d
been
know
demand
for
reciprocity
by
trial
counsel,
is
that
right?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
were
you
in
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
did
you
make
the
argument
of
the
face
of
the
statute?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
i
don’t
quite
understand
how
the
basis
upon
which
your
court
of
appeals
refuse
to
consider.
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
you
are
telling
as
you
did
in
the
court
of
appeals
make
the
argument
on
the
face
of
the
statute?
mr.
justice
bernnan
how
far
they
full
insured?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
then
the
state
will
have
a
burden
of
proving
that
date
and
that
place?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
i
don’t
--
i
don’t
frankly
understand
what
you
say
is
a
small
step
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
was
taking.
mr.
justice
bernnan
the
rights
of
discovery.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
that
didn’t
sound
to
me
as
they
put
anything
which
stated
it.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
then
why
isn’t
that
--
why
is
that
not
complete
reciprocity?
as
i
understand
it
the
--
what
you’re
now
telling
us
is
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
provide
anything,
the
statute
calls
for
unless
the
prosecutor
gives
him
what
the
state
claims
to
be
the
time
and
place
of
the
offense.
mr.
justice
bernnan
is
that
right?
well
if
they
give
them
the
time
and
place
of
the
offense,
what
more
is
he
entitled
to
do,
even
if
there
is
an
express
reciprocity
provision.
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
more
if
there
were
a
reciprocity
provision
would
be
in
--would
he
be
entitled
to
the
names
of
the
state
witnesses?
mr.
justice
bernnan
anything
else?
mr.
justice
bernnan
as
to
name
the
witnesses
but
the
state
does
not?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
the
kelsaw
went
on
and
say
also
that
the
state
must
in
addition
give
the
names
of
the
state
witnesses
and
support
of
those
allegations
of
indictment?
done
where
what
would
your
situation
be?
mr.
justice
bernnan
do
you
say
that’s
an
unconstitutional
condition?
mr.
justice
bernnan
under
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
mr.
justice
bernnan
no
discussion
at
all
of
the
names
of
witnesses.
mr.
justice
bernnan
tell
me
mr.
gillette,
do
you
agree
with
your
brother
that
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
was
raised
before
your
court
of
appeals?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
see.
mr.
justice
bernnan
then
do
you
suggest
that
question
is
not
before
us
in
consequence?
mr.
justice
bernnan
mr.
gillette,
may
i
get
back
again
to
this
quest
ion
of
whether
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
on
its
face
is
before
us,
what
is
the
argument
procedure
by
which
you
raise
a
question
in
the
trial
court
is
this
by
a
point
raise
in
the
brief
or
do
you
have
some
assignment
of
it
or
something?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
yet
when
you
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
you
told
me
earlier,
your

of

did
determine
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied,
isn’t
that
right?
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
mean,
you
can’t
say
whether
the
court
of
appeals
decided
any
constitutional
question
of
that
statute?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
just
so
i’m
clear.
you
would,
in
the

at

isn’t
