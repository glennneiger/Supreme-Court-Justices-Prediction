mr.
juctice
rehnquist
didn’t
your
oregon
court
of
appeals
say
that
they
just
had
no
occasion
that
passed
on
the
extent
to
which
reciprocity
would
be
required
since
the
record
didn’t
raise
the
issue?
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
can
you
be
sure
of
that
just
from
a
reading
of
this
one
section
of
the
oregon
statute?
isn’t
it
possible
to
read
the
oregon
court
of
appeals’
opinion
here
is
saying
that
had
a
request
been
made
to
apply
the
same
rule
to
the
state
that
very
likely
as
a
matter
of
its
interpretive
authority
it
might
have
applied
that
rule
to
the
state?
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kuhn
do
you
contend
that
if
reciprocity
is
to
be
accorded
by
oregon
law
it
has
to
be
in
the
same
section
of
the
statute
at
which
as
the
one
in
which
this
requirement
is
impose
on
the
defendant?
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
but
it
could
be
by
judicial
decision
in
the
--
as
you
have
accord
your
client
the
right
he
claims,
didn’t
he?
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
and
do
you
believe
that
completely
consistent
with
williams
against
florida
for
your
--
the
arguments
you’re
making
now?
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
under
oregon
procedure,
does
giving
of
that
sort
of
notice
by
the
defendant
committee
and
then
in
any
way
to
take
the
stand
or
is
the
statement
that
he
makes
there
independently
usable
by
the
state
if
he
does
not
take
the
stand?
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
i
take
it
you
wouldn’t
be
here
arguing
if
you
agree
that
there
was
an
absolute
right
to
testify.
