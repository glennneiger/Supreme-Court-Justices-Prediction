yes.
but
only
on
that
issue.
justice

white
and
against
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
settle
whether
or
not
giving
notice
of
the
alibi
violated
the
defendant’s
fifth
amendment
rights
against

right.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
just
tell
me
what
the
state’s
interest
is
in
having
this
alibi
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
interest
of
florida
is
lost
if
at
the
time
an
alibi
witness
is
offered
that
hasn’t
been
previously
been
disclosed,
that
the
trial
is
adjourned
until
--
so
that
the
state
may
accomplish
its
aims
of
investigation
and
avoidance
of
surprise
then
of
fraud
and
perjury?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suppose
the
state
will
do
if
we
disagree
with
you
to
sustain
your
position?
with
your
colleague
i
supposed
there
will
be
adjournments,
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think.
i
know
there
will
be
adjournment.
they
wouldn’t
--
nobody
would
tell
them
to
adjourn.
say
one,
they
didn’t
want
to
avoid
surprise,
they
don’t
need
to
avoid
surprise.
but
do
you
suppose
they
would
actually
start
adjourning
trials?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
what?
10
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
does
the
defendant
have
to
give
notice
of
alibi
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that’s
all
the
state
may
need
is
five
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
need
anymore
in
that
jury
trial,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
suppose
the
interest
of
the
defendant
would
be
in
not
notifying
of
an
alibi
if
he
was
reasonably
confident
that
--
if
he
didn’t
notify
and
still
--
and
nevertheless
offered
alibi
witnesses
during
the
trial,
the
trial
would
be
adjourned?
he
anticipated
in
the
adjournment
if
he
offered
unannounced
witnesses,
what
would
be
as
interest
in
not
notifying
before
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
plans
to
offer
alibi?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
he
gave
notice
ahead
of
time
before
trial
in
complying
with
the
statute,
there
would
be
any
adjournment
during
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
doesn’t
give
notice,
he
doesn’t
give
notice
and
then
offers.
he
is
going
to
have
to
offer
some
alibi
witnesses
then
before
there’s
any,
going
to
be
any
adjournment,
he
is
going
to
have
to
decide
to
offer
some
alibi
witnesses.
and
when
he
offers
them
then
the
state
would
ask
for
an
adjournment.
and
let’s
assume
that
defendant
knew
that
if
the
state
requested
adjournment
that
would
be
granted.
and
what
interest
would
he
have
in
not
complying
with
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
is
going
to
have
--
he
is
not
just
going
to
have
to
give
notice.
he
is
going
to
have
new
witnesses.

an

your

you
know

that’s
going

why
would
you
do

you
do
not

any
particular
advantage
in
waiting
then
if
you
are
going

have
to
be
subject
to
an
adjournment
anyway.
justice
