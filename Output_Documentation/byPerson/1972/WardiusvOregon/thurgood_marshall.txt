justice
thurgood
marshall
in
oregon
without
that
statute
don’t
you
have
a
right
to
find
that
out
by
bill
of
particulars?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
have
a
bill
of
particulars
in
oregon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
has
there
been
any
request
for
a
bill
of
particulars
in
any
case
before
the
oregon
supreme
court
as
of
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
turned
it
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
do
we
get
all
this
great
hopes
about
wha
they
got
and
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
oregon
could
pass
a
statute
requirement
defendant
to
advise
the
state
of
what
its
defense
will
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what’s
the
difference
between
that
statute
and
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
that
applies
to
other
witnesses
that
doesn’t
apply
to
the
defendant,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
could
the
state
do
to
counteract
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
almost
unbelievable.
i
can
understand
why
you
want
to
examine
the
other
witnesses.
but
the
defendant
himself,
i
thought,
had
a
right
to
do
one
of
three
things
not
testify,
testify,
and
to
take
any
position
he
wants
to
take
at
that
moment
which
could
be
directly
contrary
to
the
position
he
wanted
to
take
before
the
trial.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
one
instance
where
he
can’t.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
he
can
testify
as
an
alibi?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
defendant
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
didn’t
say
that.
i
said
that
unless
he
made
it
he
couldn’t
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
might
of
when
he
went
to
trial,
he
might
have
said
i
am
not
going
take
the
witness
stand
which
he
has
a
right
to
do
and
during
the
trial
he
changes
his
mind
and
says
i
want
to
take
the
stand
and
i
want
to
put
my
alibi
in.
he
is
prevented
from
doing
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
you
agree
that
interferes
with
his
right
to
testify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you’re
dealing
with
the
constitutionally
protected
right
to
testify
or
not
to
testify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
believe
that
the
defendant
has
an
absolute
right
to
testify
to
save
his
neck?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
trial
court
did
consider
the
constitutional
point
and
did
consider
williams,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn’t
it
consider
it
and
did
it
write
it
on
page
15?
and
he
says,
he
admits
that
the
defendant
raised
the
point
that
it
denies
him
to
effective
benefit
of
his
right
to
compulsory
process
to
obtain
witnesses
in
his
own
behalf,
which
is
his
right
to
testify.
and
then
in
the
next
paragraph
he
said,
we
will
consider
these
contentions
in
order
and
the
first
line
is
williams
against
florida.
how
do
you
interpret
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
12
(b)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
they
did
consider
it,
didn’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
position
is
that
he
was
banking
on
the
point
that
has
changed
in
date,
excused
him
from
complying
with
the
statute
and
that
was
his
only
complaint,
is
that
what
you’re
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
really
trying
to
get
under
the
good
cause
form.
justice
