justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bass,
as
the
practical
matter,
is
this
about
the
only
factual
situation
in
which
this
--
in
which
the
federal
habeas
petitioner
will
have
exhausted
state
remedies
and
still
be
free
on
his
own
recognizance?
i
would
think
during
the
course
of
his
appeal
on
state
courts,
for
example,
he
can’t
get
federal
habeas
because
he
hasn’t
exhausted
his
state
remedies
and
that
it
might
be
a
fairly
limited
situation
in
which
this
type
of
thing
would
occur?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that’s
the
faith
of
almost
all
habeas
petitioners,
isn’t
it?
it’s
almost
fortuitous
that
the
state
court
here
happened
to
grant
bail
because
ordinarily,
a
federal
habeas
court
won’t
grant
bail
pending
its
own
decision
as
to
whether
the
state
conviction
is
valid.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
great
majority,
your
habeas
petitioners
are
in
jail
when
they
--
in
serving
time,
it
might
be
held
invalid
by
the
federal
habeas
court,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
judge
nelson
wasn’t
as
friendly
to
you
as
you
thought.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
lempert,
the
state
could
have
vindicated
that
right
here,
couldn’t
it
through
its
own
municipal
court
judges’
refusal
to
grant
the
stay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
lempert,
if
judge
nelson
hadn’t
granted
this
stay,
is
it
fair
to
suggest
that
nonetheless
before
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
federal
habeas
petition
either
the
district
court
or
a
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit
or
a
justice
of
this
court
would’ve
enlarge
the
petitioner?
