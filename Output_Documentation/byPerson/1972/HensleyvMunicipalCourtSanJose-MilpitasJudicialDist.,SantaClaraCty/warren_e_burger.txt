we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-1428,
hensley
against
the
municipal
court.
mr.
bass,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
still
relevant
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
see
as
the
scope
of
the
issues
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you’re
successful,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
court
will
in
effect
have
a
trial
de
novo
on
all
the
issues,
will
they
not,
in
practical
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
your
point
of
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
deliberate
bypass.
but
after
you
crossed
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wasn’t
--
couldn’t
it
be
said
equally
that
the
state
judge
was
simply
being
appropriately
deferential
to
the
fact
that
a
petition
was
filed
not
to
anything
more
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
the
state
in
that
allegation,
the
second
sentence
of
paragraph
8,
it’s
saying
any
more
than
it’s
saying
now
in
this
court,
that
absent
custody,
no
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
is
it
not
all
they
are
saying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
bass.
mr.
lempert.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
there
were
such
a
territorial
jurisdiction,
did
it
disappear
when
the
federal
habeas
proceedings
restarted?
you’ve
said
the
state
courts
have
been
powerless
ever
since
that
petition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
whatever
the
restrictions
were,
they
vanished
then,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lempert,
if
the
person
is
served
with
a
subpoena
in
a
civil
case,
an
automobile
accident
case
and
he’s
under
an
obligation
to
appear
on
a
day
certain
as
soon
as
he
receives
that
subpoena,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
that
and
he’s
been
paid
the
fees
in
advance
etcetera,
would
habeas
corpus
be
available
to
lift
that
subpoena?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
surrendered
to
the
state
now,
voluntarily,
to
begin
his
sentence
within
30
minutes
or
even
three
minutes
thereafter,
a
federal
district
judge
could
let
him
out
again
pending
determination,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
wouldn’t
question
that
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
he’s
just
sitting
in
the
anteroom
of
the
state
judge
nelson’s
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
get
the
impression
that
you
thought
that
you
said
before
that
going
in,
in
this
process
of
surrendering
himself
to
custody
of
the
state
and
then
immediately
filing
on
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
and
asking,
was
this
a
meaningless
ritual,
is
that?
chief
