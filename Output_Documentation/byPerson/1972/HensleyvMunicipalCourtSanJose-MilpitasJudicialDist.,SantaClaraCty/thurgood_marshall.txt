what
you

isn’t

he
under?

thurgood
marshall
was
that
any
different
from
being
picked
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
i’m
saying.

can
be
done
to
him

than

court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.

how
long
does
the
municipal

grants
his
jurisdiction
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
maybe
less
than
or
more
than
20
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn’t
clear
in
california
one
way
or
the
other
but
sometimes
the
court
reached
to
those
standards.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
happens
on
appeal
if
you
leave
the
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
he
hold
the
sentence
over
the
period
of
one
year?

thurgood
marshall

thought
you
said
he
can
stay

long
as
he
wanted
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think

thurgood
marshall
mr.

if
we
backed
up
a
minute.
did
judge

gave
a
stay
when
they
first
went
into
the
federal
court,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
that
stage,
wouldn’t
we
have
been
citing
to
all
of
these
and
he
said,
“no,
wait
a
minute.
before
i
give
you
the
stay,
let
me
push
him
in.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
this
whole
point
would
have
been
gone.
justice
thurgood
marshall

a
stay,
just
revoke
the
