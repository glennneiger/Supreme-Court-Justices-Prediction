unknown
speaker
do
i
understand,
that
you
to
have
answered
to
justice
marshall
that
the
state
appeal
has
been
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
all
of
these
after
the
appeal
from
the
conviction
had
come
down?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bass,
i
think
my
confusion
rises
from
this
--
he
was
sentenced
to
a
year
in
a
jail,
was
he
not
in
addition
to
a
fine?
unknown
speaker
has
he
ever
served
any
part
of
that
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
where
i
am
confused.
why
wasn’t
he
incarcerated
when
his
appeal
was
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
while
the
habeas
petitions
were
pending
on
state
and
federal?
unknown
speaker
was
it
--
is
it
a
contempt
not
to
show
up?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
restraints
imposed
upon
him
are
listed
fully
in
the
first
paragraph
of
your
argument
on
page
6.
unknown
speaker
indeed
and
more
than
fully
because
you
talked
about,
in
some
jurisdictions,
territorial,
and
supervisory
restrictions
were
also
imposed
which
implies
that
that’s
not
true
--
unknown
speaker
--in
california.
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
involved
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
when
you’re
released
on
bail
and
the
only
restriction
on
you
is
don’t
leave
the
jurisdiction,
don’t
leave
the
county,
is
that
custody?
unknown
speaker
i
didn’t
ask
you
that.
i
asked
you,
suppose
you
were
under
territorial
restriction.
unknown
speaker
but
i
believe
that
the
court
has
held
that
the
parolee
released
from
physical
custody
but
under
certain
restraints
is
in
custody
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal.
one
of
those
typical
restraints
is
a
territorial
jurisdiction.
don’t
leave
the
state
or
don’t
leave
the
county
or
something
like
that.
now,
but
the
only
sanction
for
that
is
you’ll
be
jumping
bail
if
you
--
or
you’ll
be
violating
your
parole
if
you
leave
the
county.
you
might
be
committing
a
crime
where
your
parole
might
be
revoked.
if
you’re
under
an
obligation
to
show
up
at
a
certain
time
and
you
don’t
show
up,
you
certainly
have
some
obligation
that
other
people
of
the
community
don’t
have.
unknown
speaker
and
you’re
supposed
to
be
in
some
place
at
a
certain
time
that
you
aren’t.
unknown
speaker
i’m
sorry,
mr.
lempert
but
i’m
confused.
if
judge
peckham
had
not
issued
the
stay
order
--
unknown
speaker
well,
who
was
the
first
federal
judge
to
issue
a
stay
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
had
that
not
issued
--
unknown
speaker
now,
how
would
you
have
been
incarcerated
in
light
of
judge
nelson’s
admitting
him
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
decision
of
the
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
well,
had
judge
nelson’s
stay
expired
with
judge
peckham’s
decision?
unknown
speaker
by
judge
peckham
only?
unknown
speaker
so,
but
in
another
case,
that
this
case
could
arise
again
then
in
the
sense
that
a
state
judge
might
enlarge
a
man
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
the
filing,
the
decision
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
i
didn’t
--
but
what
if
the
state
judge,
do
it
though.
he
wouldn’t
do
it
for
that
purpose
but
--
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand,
that
you
to
have
answered
to
justice
marshall
that
the
state
appeal
has
been
affirmed?

this

why
wasn’t
he
incarcerated
when
his

unknown

while
the
habeas

were
pending
on
state
and
federal?
unknown
speaker
was
it
--
is
it
a
contempt
not
to

unknown

i
suppose
the
restraints
imposed
upon
him
are
listed
fully
in
the

unknown

indeed
and
more
than
fully
because
you

in
some
jurisdictions,
territorial,
and

restrictions
were
also

which

unknown

i
didn’t
ask

i
asked
you,

you

but
i

that

if

and

show
up,
you
certainly
have
some

if

who
was
the

federal
judge
to
issue

are

he
