justice

well,
you
don’t
mean
a
different
federal
statute
in
light
of
what
we
held
in
jones.
it
means
in
every
case,
you
have
to
be
in
jail
before
--

now,
but
perhaps

was
not
in
jail.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
question
is
whether
one
on
his
own
recognizance
is
in
custody
in
the
same
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
that
judge
peckham
might
have
said
to
himself,
“well,
i
don’t
have
jurisdiction
of
this
petitioner’s
petition
for
habeas
corpus
since
he’s
not
in
custody
but
i’ll
take
this
petition
as
a
1983
application,
alleging
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
and
i
will
now,
treating
it
that
way
incident
to
a
1983
petition,
i’ll
continue
on
his
own
recognizance.”
could
he
have
done
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
not
uncommon,
isn’t
it?

mystery
things.
