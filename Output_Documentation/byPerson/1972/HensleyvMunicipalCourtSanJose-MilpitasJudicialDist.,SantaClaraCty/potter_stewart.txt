it’s
got
a
non
sequitur
on
paragraph
8
unless
i
am
reading
too
fast.
the
state
concedes,
this
is
the
state’s
return,
isn’t
it,
the
warden
has
returned
or
whoever?
justice
potter
stewart
municipal
court.
he’s
out
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
therefore,
this
court
is
not
on
the
position
to
here
consider
a
grant
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
what’s
it
therefore?
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
be
guilty
as
indicated
in
the
argument
of
a
separate
offense
also.
justice
potter
stewart
under
a
constitute
custody?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
federal
court’s
stay?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
federal
circuit’s
just
to
stay.
justice
potter
stewart
the
federal
--
if
there
was
a
federal
jurisdiction,
it
was
destroyed
by
the
issuance
of
a
stay
by
a
federal
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
then
doesn’t
this
get
very
circular
or
am
i
confused?
in
other
words,
if
we
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
as
you’re
asking
us
to
do
then
no
judge
in
the
future
will
ever
issue
a
stay
because
he’ll
say,
“i
have
no
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
until
or
unless
you’re
incarcerated,”
isn’t
that
right?
so,
this
case
would
never
arise
again.
justice
potter
stewart
[voice

would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
not
talking
about
a
federal
judge.
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
that
the
man
was
convicted
on
the
municipal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
the
municipal
court
judge
released
him
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
an
appeal
and--
justice
potter
stewart
through
the
state
system.
justice
potter
stewart
and
by
its
own
terms,
that
municipal
judges
stay
would
have
terminated
after
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
the
state’s
system,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
after
affirmance,
the
stay
would’ve
terminated?
justice
potter
stewart
had
it
not
been
for
the
intervention
of
the
federal
district
judge,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
only
after
an
application
for
habeas
corpus,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
[voice

you
better
tell
me
what
happened.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
whole
time,
this
man
was
out
on
his
recognizance.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
original
municipal
court
order,
plus
the
operation
of
the
california
law
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
and
automatically,
the
man
would’ve
gone
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
who’s
judge
nelson?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
is
still
back
at
the
state
municipal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
he’s
also
unaware
of
the
ninth
circuit
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
absence,
i
guess
really
what
it
boils
down
to
that.
however,
this
case
is
decided
in
the
absence
of
a
stay
order
by
a
federal
judge.
the
person
is
going
to
be
in
prison,
isn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
in
jail.
starting
on
the
serving
of
the
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
it
takes
a
stay
order
of
a
federal
judge
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
keep
him
in
the
status
that
this
man
now
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
ordinary
operation
of
state
law,
this
question
isn’t
going
to
arise
because
he’ll
begin
serving
a
sentence.
that’s
in
the
conclusion
of
the
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
depend
on
how
this
case
today
is
decided.
justice

there
would
be
