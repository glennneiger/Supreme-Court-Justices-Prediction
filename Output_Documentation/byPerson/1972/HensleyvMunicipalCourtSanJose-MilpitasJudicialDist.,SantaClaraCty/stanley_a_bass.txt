mr.
stanley
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
in
dismissing
the
petition
did
not
reach
any
substantive
issues
but
denied
the
petition
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
petitioner
being
enlarged
on
his
own
recognizance
by
the
state
trial
judge
pending
the
outcome
the
federal
habeas
proceeding
was
not
“in
custody”
for
purposes
of
the
federal
habeas
statute.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
or
not
a
federal
habeas
judge
is
without
power
to
entertain
a
petition
for
the
writ
until
the
state
criminal
defendant
who
is
sentenced
to
imprisonment
surrenders
into
jail.
whether
the
defendant
has
exhausted
his
available
state
court
remedies
and
has
been
permitted
by
the
very
judge
who
imposed
the
sentence
to
remain
at
large,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
federal
habeas
proceeding.
the
background
facts
will
be
briefly
as
follows.
the
petitioner
hensley
is
a
chief
presiding
officer
of
the
universal
life
church
which
has
awarded
honorary
doctor
of
divinity
degrees.
he
was
charged
of
violating
a
california
misdemeanor
provision
which
prohibited
the
awarding
of
degrees
which
signify
academic
accomplishment
without
meeting
accreditation
requirements.
the
trial
was
held
on
may
19,
1969.
at
the
close
of
the
state’s
case,
the
defendant
moved
to
dismiss.
the
court
held
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
in
the
state
all
throughout
the
proceedings.
subsequently,
the
state
moved
to
reopen
the
case.
mr.
bienvenu,
the
defendant’s
counsel
at
that
time
declined
to
appear
at
the
reopening.
he
advised
the
prosecutor
that
neither
he
nor
hensley
would
appear.
however,
the
traverse
in
this
case
states
that
hensley
was
never
advised
by
mr.
bienvenu
that
he
had
to
appear
or
that
his
failure
to
appear
would
result
in
conviction.
on
the
contrary,
he
says,
he
was
advised
that
the
trial
was
dismissed
and
that
he
did
not
appear
further.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
may
be
relevant
in
so
far
as
we
deal
with
his
status
on
release
on
recognizance
or
whether
or
not
there’s
been
a
deliberate
bypass.
i
think
it
may
not
be
relevant,
however,
it’s
offered
in
case
questions
do
arise
with
respect
to
that
but
the
court
held
in
defendant’s
absence
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
and
it
found
the
defendant
guilty
in
absentia.
and
on
july
1,
1969,
one
year
imprisonment
was
imposed
plus
a
$625
fine
and
costs.
and
at
that
time,
the
state
trial
judge
granted
a
stay
and
allowed
the
defendant
to
remain
on
his
own
recognizance
of
pending
appeal.
subsequently,
the
conviction
was
affirmed
and
state
trial
judge
permitted
hensley
to
remain
on
o.r.
pending
the
exhaustion
of
state
post
conviction
remedies
which
were
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
in
the
california
supreme
court.
then
on
june
16,
1970,
hensley
filed
his
federal
habeas.
on
the
same
day,
the
state
trial
judge
granted
a
stay,
an
additional
stay.
permitting
him
to
remain
at
large,
pending
the
determination
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
application.
federal
habeas
corpus
judge
found
that
or
ruled
that
hensley
was
not
in
custody
because
he
was
on
recognizance
and
he
denied
the
petition.
however,
he
granted
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
rehearing
was
denied.
a
timely
petition
for
cert.
was
filed
and
this
court
granted
cert.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
don’t
get
into
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
remedies
are
so
ineffective
as
to
check
the
rights
of
the
petitioner
that
we
have
a
question
under
2254.
here,
since
hensley
was
permitted
to
remain
at
large
by
the
state
trial
judge,
he
exhausted
all
of
his
state
remedies
without
the
problem
of
his
having
to
surrender
and
his
sentence
running
and
the
question
of
possibly
becoming
moot.
here,
the
issue
was
preserved
because
at
all
times,
he
was
permitted
to
remain
on
his
recognizance
by
the
state
trial
judge.
the
important
factor
to
note
is
that
the
state
trial
judge
who
permitted
hensley
to
remain
on
his
recognizance
may
well
have
felt
that
hensley’s
failure
to
appear
in
trial
was
not
intentional
and
would
have
a
bearing
at
such
time
as
the
federal
court
reaches
the
question
of
deliberate
bypass.
but
it
would
appear
that
by
releasing
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
state
court
reached
the
custody
question.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
they
could
but
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
problem
was
that
it
was
never
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it
was
raised
but
the
state
habeas
corpus
petitions
were
denied
without
opinion.
the
opportunity
to
present
a
defense
was
lost
by
virtue
of
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
there
was
a
direct
appeal.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
appeal
was
affirmed
by
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
which
point,
your
honor?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
believe
that
the
state
court
took
the
position
that
there
was
a
presumption
that
anyone
who
absents
themselves
waives
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
believe
the
--
no,
the
opinion
of
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
opinion
of
the
state
court
is
not
in
the
record.
the
point
here
is
that
the
record
needs
to
be
developed
before
the
judge
can
make
a
finding
that
there’s
been
an
intentional
relinquishment
of
federal
constitutional
right.
one
cannot
conclude
there’s
a
bypass
on
this
record.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
issue
this
time
is
the
custody
question,
but
the
underlying
constitutional
questions
asserted
in
the
petition
relate
to
freedom
of
religion
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
and
that
he
was
sentenced,
that
he
was
convicted
in
absentia.
and
he’s
also
arguing
that
he
was
engaged
in
constitutionally
protected
activity.
because
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
present
a
defense
in
the
state
court,
the
record
--
no
record
is
made
of
the
first
amendment
issue.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
was
due
to
a
combination
of
factors.
part
of
which
was
the
alleged
inadvertence
or
incompetence
of
counsel
in
not
telling
hensley
that
he
had
to
appear,
otherwise,
he
would
lose
his
opportunity
to
make
defense.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
point
was
not
raised
in
the
appeal
taken
to
the
superior
court
appellate
department.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it
was
raised
in
the
state
habeas
corpus.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
state
appeal
was
affirmed.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that’s
correct.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
he
seeks
to
abort
the
state
for
prosecution.
he
has
already
been
tried
and
sentenced
and
has
exhausted
what
would
be
the
--
all
of
the
available
state
court
remedies
in
california.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
he
has
exhausted.
he
has
tendered
to
the
state
courts
in
his
state
habeas
petitions.
the
issues
that
he
seeks
to
raise
here.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
timing
on
this
is
that
he
filed
an
appeal
from
the
conviction.
that
appeal
was
affirmed.
he
then
raised
on
petition
for
rehearing
or
for
certification,
the
issues
of
lack
of
adequate
representation
and
conviction
in
absentia.
that
was
denied.
he
then
filed
habeas
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
and
that
was
denied.
he
then
filed
an
original
habeas
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
that
was
denied.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
then
subsequently,
in
june
of
1970
he
filed
a
federal
habeas
after
there
were
no
other
procedures
available
in
the
state.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
first
issue,
i
would
think
that
the
federal
habeas
judge
would
entertain
is
the
question
of
deliberate
bypass
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
hensley
intentionally
relinquished
his
opportunity
to
appear
and
to
raise
any
defense
and
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
it
would
appear
that
the
first
amendment
issue
might
not
be
reached
until
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
as
to
whether
or
not
hensley
deliberately
absented
himself
from
the
state
trial
court
would
be
resolved.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
not
to
my
knowledge,
i
think
he
has
not.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
because
the
state
trial
judge
continually
granted
stays,
keeping
mr.
hensley
on
recognizance
[voice
overlap].
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
state
trial
judge
granted
a
state
pending
appeal.
he
granted
another
state
pending
--
state
habeas
applications.
he
granted
another
stay
pending,
a
federal
habeas
corpus.
and
after
the
federal
habeas
was
denied,
he
granted
a
stay
for
about
two
weeks
at
which
one
mr.
justice
black
granted
an
eight-day
stay.
mr.
justice
douglas
granted
a
two-week
stay
and
then
a
stay
pending
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
was
granted.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
except
for
the
fact
that
he’s
going
to
serve
one
year
in
jail
if
he
does
not
get
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
the
basis
of
our
argument
is
that
term
in
custody
used
by
congress
relates
to
the
class
of
cases
not
the
timing
as
to
when
the
petition
must
be
filed.
the
state’s
argument
here
is
not
based
upon
any
legitimate
needs
of
federal
judicial
administration.
it’s
not
based
upon
any
law
enforcement
needs
but
is
based
strictly
upon
an
outmoded
conceptual
definition.
in
this
case,
if
the
habeas
petition
is
not
permitted
to
be
filed
while
he’s
on
recognizance,
he
will
file
it
when
he’s
in
custody,
there’ll
be
the
same
number
of
federal
habeas
petitions.
there
will
not
be
an
increase
in
the
federal
case
law.
secondly,
if
he
is
not
committed
to
file
the
habeas
while
he
is
on
recognizance
and
must
go
into
jail,
there
would
be
more
pressure
on
the
district
court
to
move
more
quickly,
to
hear
the
case.
whereas
if
he’s
on
recognizance
granted
by
the
state
trial
judge,
the
federal
court
can
hear
the
thing
in
a
more
leisurely
fashioned.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
peyton
versus
rowe,
it’s
in
everyone’s
interest
to
hear
the
habeas
corpus
application.
it’s
in
the
state’s
interest.
it’s
in
the
petitioner’s
interest.
it’s
in
the
court’s
interest.
in
fact,
it
will
cost
the
state
money
to
incarcerate
this
person
unnecessarily,
perhaps.
if
it
turns
out
that
the
federal
rights
are
involved,
there
will
be
irretrievably
loss.
there’s
absolutely
no
reason
to
commend
the
result
urged
by
the
state
in
this
case.
in
peyton
versus
rowe,
this
court
allowed
the
use
of
anticipatory
attack
upon
a
future
sentence.
in
jones
versus
cunningham,
it
was
unnecessary
to
wait
until
parole
was
revoked
before
jones
could
bring
the
habeas.
in
strait
versus
laird,
it
was
unnecessary
to
wait
until
the
servicemen
were
reactivated
before
he
could
bring
his
conscientious
objector
application.
in
this
case,
we
deal
not
with
the
question
of
a
district
court’s
discretion
but
simply
with
the
question
of
power.
there
is
no
need
here,
for
example,
for
the
federal
court
to
determine
if
bail
should
be
granted
because
the
state
trial
judge
has
already
granted
the
stay
while
he
exhausts
the
federal
habeas.
this
is
the
reverse
situation
of
the
case
in
the
california
supreme
court
called
in
re
smiley.
there,
a
federal
court
granted
on
recognizance
release
and
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
they
had
jurisdiction
to
grant
habeas
relief.
they
said,
if
they
have
the
authority
to
release
the
person,
there
was
no
reason
why
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
them
to
say
they
lack
authority
merely
because
someone
else
has
done
it
for
them.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
of
course,
that
issue
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
--is
not
presented
now,
mr.
chief
justice
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
if
the
case
is
remanded
back
to
the
district
court,
the
first
question
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
answer
is
whether
or
not
hensley
made
a
deliberate
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
after
we
crossed
that,
the
question
then
is
whether
or
not
he
was
deprived
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
by
losing
his
right
to
present
substantial
statutory
as
well
as
constitutional
defenses.
there’s
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
california
statute
applies
to
a
church
granting
honorary
doctor
of
divinity
degrees,
and
that
issue
was
never
litigated
because
he
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
appear
in
the
time
that
we
raised
it.
so,--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
municipal
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
thought
you
meant
with
respect
to
the
stay
that
was
granted.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
he
is
under
the
eminent
control
of
the
sheriff
who
would
be
the
person
who
runs
the
local
jail
to
whom
hensley
would
have
to
surrender.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
has
to
surrender
as
soon
as
the
stay
expires.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
nothing
but
however,
there’s
interesting
parallel
between
this
situation
and
the
situation
of
jones
versus
cunningham
where
this
court
pointed
out
the
jones
could
be
rearrested
at
anytime
the
parole
officer
felt
that
he
violated
his
parole.
under
the
california
statute,
the
o.r.
or
recognizance
could
be
revoked
presumably
without
the
same
type
of
procedural
due
process
as
the
trial.
and
hensley
could
be
taken
any
day
if
it
were
not
for
the
stay
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
by
the
sheriff
and
incarcerated
in
his
jail.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it
constitutes
--
well,
it
pretty
constitute
a
contempt.
it
certainly
constitutes
a
separate
crime.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
oh,
yes,
in
california
it’s
a
crime.
it
constitutes
a
separate
offense
and
if
he’s
caught
outside
the
jurisdiction,
extradition
is
automatically
waived.
and
under
those
circumstances,
it’s
not
a
restraint
to
not
share
it
by
the
public,
generally.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
submit
that
it
is
a
very
real
difference.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it’s
not
like
parole
in
this
sense
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
taken
away
so
easily
without
notice,
perhaps.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
is
under
the
--
under
the
imminent
incarceration,
the
threat
of
incarceration
at
any
time.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
man
is
indicted,
[voice
overlap]
he
can’t
bring
habeas
because
he
hasn’t
exhausted
his
state
court
remedies.
hensley
has
run
the
string
out.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
of
course.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
because
he
hasn’t
exhausted
the
state
court
remedies.
the
doctrine
of
prematurity
would
take
care
of
cases
like
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
was
taken
from
the
statute.
right.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that’s
true.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
is
not
--
that’s
true
and
it’s
not
but
we
don’t
think
that
the
absence
of
territorial
restrictions
is
that
meaningful,
if
one
looks
at
strait
versus
laird,
for
example.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
i
said
the
only
restriction.
he
owes
them
a
year.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
is
the
only
restriction
that’s
present
in
the
sense
that
the
restriction
that
he
has
to
serve
a
year
would
be
a
term
to
be
in
future.
however,
that
may
be
just
a
manifestable
way
of
looking
at
it
because
may
be
--
maybe
that’s
tomorrow
that
he
has
to
serve
for
a
year.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
restrictions
are
--
well,
as
the
california
statute
points
out,
he
is
required
to
appear
whenever
the
judge
requires
him
to
come
in
and
that
in
default
he
waives
extradition
that
it’s
an
offense
if
he
doesn’t
show
up.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
he’s
got
an
outstanding
detainer,
a
one
year
sentence.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
he
owes
a
fine.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
don’t
think
he’s
ordered
stand
permitted
in
default
of
payment,
but
we
think
that
the
fact
that
he
owes
that
one
year
sentence.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
my
argument
is
restricted
to
a
man
who
had
been
convicted
and
had
been
sentenced
for
imprisonment.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
and
who
has
exhausted
the
state
remedies.
we
don’t
deal
with
the
situation
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
right,
i’m
not
dealing
with
the
situation
of
a
person
who
has
merely
fined.
i’m
not
dealing
with
the
situation
of
a
person
who’s
already
served
the
sentence
and
who
just
complains
about
the
civil
disabilities
that
come
from
conviction
because
this
situation
evolves
the
most
graphic
type
of
deprivation
namely
imprisonment.
and
the
court
need
not
reached
the
other
question
particularly
the
question
raised
in
the
united
states
ex
rel.
meyer
versus
weil
which
is
the
seventh
circuit
case
where
the
supreme
court
denied
cert.
last
month.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
in
that
case,
the
prison
had
filed
a
habeas.
he
had
just
been
fined.
he
raised
a
free-speech
question.
the
seventh
circuit
said
he
was
not
in
sufficient
custody.
the
problem
was
he
had
posted
10%
under
the
illinois
statute
which
could
have
been
set
off
against
the
fine,
so
he
never
would’ve
done
any
time
in
jail.
there’s
no
anticipatory
incarceration
possible.
whereas
in
this
case,
of
course,
that
one
year
is
staring
him
in
the
face,
and
if
he
doesn’t
get
relief
from
the
federal
habeas
court,
he
will
be
in
jail.
and
of
course,
if
he
is
in
jail,
everyday
that
he
suffers
in
jail
that
may
turn
out
to
be
unconstitutionally
imposed.
that
would
be
irretrievable.
he
will
never
be
able
to
get
anything
out
of
that.
moreover,
if
we’re
dealing
with
cases
involving
very
short
sentence
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
don’t
have
that
probability
as
this
court
in
shuttlesworth
did
state
that
the
federal
court
have
a
power
to
do
that.
it
is
true
that
the
in
this
case,
the
state
court
must
have
thought
enough
about
the
issues
and
perhaps
hensley’s
non-dangerousness
to
allow
him
to
remain
on
a
recognizance
for
such
a
long
period
of
time.
and
whether
he’s
being
considered
a
charitable
or
just
what
is
legally
necessary,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
he
has
not
been
recalled.
he
could
be.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
but
the
situation
we
deal
with
here
is
where
a
state
judge
has
granted
the
stay.
under
such
circumstances,
we
find
that
it
would
be
no
reason
why
the
federal
judge
should
deny
or
asked
you
power
to
hear
when
the
very
reason
for
the
state
court
allowing
the
man
to
stay
is
so
the
federal
judge
can
hear
the
petition
without
being
presented
with
stay
applications
or
other
types
of
emergency
request
for
immediate
relief.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
don’t
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
state
court
is
required
under
any
consideration
of
supremacy
or
federalism
to
grant
such
a
stay.
that
would
seem
to
be
entirely
a
matter
of
discretion
and
if
he
decides
not
to
grant
the
stay,
then
the
petitioner
would
have
to
ask
the
district
court
for
that
stay.
but
that
was
unnecessary
in
this
case
because
the
state
granted
it.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
record
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
powell,
page
12
(a)
of
paragraph
8
of
the
return
to
the
order
of
the
show
course,
the
state
indicates,
“he
is
at
liberty
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.”
and
on
page
19
(a)
of
the
record,
it
indicates
that
stay
was
granted
by
judge
nelson
who
was
the
judge
of
the
municipal
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
realized
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
--
it
sounds
extremely
illogical
because
the
whole
purpose
of
granting
the
stay
was
to
allow
him
to
do
it
and
now
by
the
state
judge
having
allowed
him
to
do
that,
then
the
federal
judge
says
he
can’t
do
that.
there
is
a
sort
of
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
oh,
i
think
that
perhaps
that
he
was.
but
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
i
did
have
copies,
actual
copies
of
the
state
order
granted
by
the
state
court.
if
the
court
would
wish
i
could
leave
copies
with
the
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that’s
true,
that’s
what
they’re
saying
but
the
juxtaposition
of
the
two
sentences
perhaps
better
than
anything
demonstrates
the
illogic
of
their
position.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
mr.
justice
powell,
the
order
granted
by
the
state
court
is
a
one-page
order
that
simply
says
it’s
order
that
the
sentence
given
to
the
petitioners
identified
is
hereby
stayed
pending
determination
of
the
petitioner’s
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
we
would
submit
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
is
asking
mr.
hensley
to
go
through
a
meaningless
ritual
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
serves
no
legitimate
purpose.
it
does
not
serve
judicial
administration.
it
does
not
serve
the
state’s
interest
and
it
certainly
doesn’t
serve
the
petitioner’s
interest
to
be
incarcerated
under
such
circumstances
before
he
can
file
where
in
fact,
we
have
imprisonment,
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
involved
here,
under
such
circumstances,
it
is
clear
that
the
federal
habeas
court
did
have
authority
and
that
mr.
hensley
was
in
sufficient
custody
to
be
able
to
invoke
the
writ.
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
for
the
record,
after
the
federal
habeas
was
denied,
the
state
trial
judge
then
granted
another
stay
of
about
12
days
and
that
was
the
stay
that
kept
him
out
until
mr.
justice
black
acted
on
august
the
12th.
the
habeas
petition
was
denied
on
july
31,
so
that
the
--
there
was
dovetailing
throughout
of
stay
orders
that
were
granted
by
the
state
trial
judge
before
the
federal
judge
did
know.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
thought
it
was
a
meaningless
ritual
for
the
petitioner
to
have
to
go
through.
i
also
have
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
i
thought
that
it
would
be
an
extremely
inadequate
remedy
to
suggest
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
surrender
either
into
the
anteroom
or
to
the
institution
of
confinement
and
then
he
could
probably
be
bailed
by
a
federal
judge.
the
two
circuits,
the
fifth
and
the
eighth
circuit
that
decided
the
issue
the
other
way,
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit,
both
involved
civil
rights
cases
coming
out
of
itself.
and
it
was
no
accident
that
in
those
cases
it
was
extremely
important
that
the
person
who
is
still
out
on
some
sort
of
former
release
be
allowed
to
seek
vindication
in
the
federal
courts
in
a
timely
fashion.
and
we
submit
that
there
really
is
no
reason
other
than
just
a
definitional
one
which
is
outmoded,
and
we
think
has
been
superseded
by
strait
versus
laird
and
all
of
the
pervious
cases
that
this
person
can
be
considered
in
custody
for
the
purposes
of
2241
(c)
(3).
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
in
dismissing
the
petition
did
not
reach
any
substantive
issues
but
denied
the
petition
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
petitioner
being
enlarged
on
his
own
recognizance
by
the
state
trial
judge
pending
the
outcome
the
federal
habeas
proceeding
was
not
“in
custody”
for
purposes
of
the
federal
habeas
statute.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
or
not
a
federal
habeas
judge
is
without
power
to
entertain
a
petition
for
the
writ
until
the
state
criminal
defendant
who
is
sentenced
to
imprisonment
surrenders
into
jail.
whether
the
defendant
has
exhausted
his
available
state
court
remedies
and
has
been
permitted
by
the
very
judge
who
imposed
the
sentence
to
remain
at
large,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
federal
habeas
proceeding.
the
background
facts
will
be
briefly
as
follows.
the
petitioner
hensley
is
a
chief
presiding
officer
of
the
universal
life
church
which
has
awarded
honorary
doctor
of
divinity
degrees.
he
was
charged
of
violating
a
california
misdemeanor
provision
which
prohibited
the
awarding
of
degrees
which
signify
academic
accomplishment
without
meeting
accreditation
requirements.
the
trial
was
held
on
may
19,
1969.
at
the
close
of
the
state’s
case,
the
defendant
moved
to
dismiss.
the
court
held
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
in
the
state
all
throughout
the
proceedings.
subsequently,
the
state
moved
to
reopen
the
case.
mr.
bienvenu,
the
defendant’s
counsel
at
that
time
declined
to
appear
at
the
reopening.
he
advised
the
prosecutor
that
neither
he
nor
hensley
would
appear.
however,
the
traverse
in
this
case
states
that
hensley
was
never
advised
by
mr.
bienvenu
that
he
had
to
appear
or
that
his
failure
to
appear
would
result
in
conviction.
on
the
contrary,
he
says,
he
was
advised
that
the
trial
was
dismissed
and
that
he
did
not
appear
further.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
may
be
relevant
in
so
far
as
we
deal
with
his
status
on
release
on
recognizance
or
whether
or
not
there’s
been
a
deliberate
bypass.
i
think
it
may
not
be
relevant,
however,
it’s
offered
in
case
questions
do
arise
with
respect
to
that
but
the
court
held
in
defendant’s
absence
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
and
it
found
the
defendant
guilty
in
absentia.
and
on
july
1,
1969,
one
year
imprisonment
was
imposed
plus
a
$625
fine
and
costs.
and
at
that
time,
the
state
trial
judge
granted
a
stay
and
allowed
the
defendant
to
remain
on
his
own
recognizance
of
pending
appeal.
subsequently,
the
conviction
was
affirmed
and
state
trial
judge
permitted
hensley
to
remain
on
o.r.
pending
the
exhaustion
of
state
post
conviction
remedies
which
were
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
in
the
california
supreme
court.
then
on
june
16,
1970,
hensley
filed
his
federal
habeas.
on
the
same
day,
the
state
trial
judge
granted
a
stay,
an
additional
stay.
permitting
him
to
remain
at
large,
pending
the
determination
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
application.
federal
habeas
corpus
judge
found
that
or
ruled
that
hensley
was
not
in
custody
because
he
was
on
recognizance
and
he
denied
the
petition.
however,
he
granted
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
rehearing
was
denied.
a
timely
petition
for
cert.
was
filed
and
this
court
granted
cert.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
don’t
get
into
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
remedies
are
so
ineffective
as
to
check
the
rights
of
the
petitioner
that
we
have
a
question
under
2254.
here,
since
hensley
was
permitted
to
remain
at
large
by
the
state
trial
judge,
he
exhausted
all
of
his
state
remedies
without
the
problem
of
his
having
to
surrender
and
his
sentence
running
and
the
question
of
possibly
becoming
moot.
here,
the
issue
was
preserved
because
at
all
times,
he
was
permitted
to
remain
on
his
recognizance
by
the
state
trial
judge.
the
important
factor
to
note
is
that
the
state
trial
judge
who
permitted
hensley
to
remain
on
his
recognizance
may
well
have
felt
that
hensley’s
failure
to
appear
in
trial
was
not
intentional
and
would
have
a
bearing
at
such
time
as
the
federal
court
reaches
the
question
of
deliberate
bypass.
but
it
would
appear
that
by
releasing
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
state
court
reached
the
custody
question.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
they
could
but
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
problem
was
that
it
was
never
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it
was
raised
but
the
state
habeas
corpus
petitions
were
denied
without
opinion.
the
opportunity
to
present
a
defense
was
lost
by
virtue
of
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
there
was
a
direct
appeal.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
appeal
was
affirmed
by
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
which
point,
your
honor?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
believe
that
the
state
court
took
the
position
that
there
was
a
presumption
that
anyone
who
absents
themselves
waives
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
believe
the
--
no,
the
opinion
of
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
opinion
of
the
state
court
is
not
in
the
record.
the
point
here
is
that
the
record
needs
to
be
developed
before
the
judge
can
make
a
finding
that
there’s
been
an
intentional
relinquishment
of
federal
constitutional
right.
one
cannot
conclude
there’s
a
bypass
on
this
record.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
issue
this
time
is
the
custody
question,
but
the
underlying
constitutional
questions
asserted
in
the
petition
relate
to
freedom
of
religion
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
and
that
he
was
sentenced,
that
he
was
convicted
in
absentia.
and
he’s
also
arguing
that
he
was
engaged
in
constitutionally
protected
activity.
because
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
present
a
defense
in
the
state
court,
the
record
--
no
record
is
made
of
the
first
amendment
issue.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
was
due
to
a
combination
of
factors.
part
of
which
was
the
alleged
inadvertence
or
incompetence
of
counsel
in
not
telling
hensley
that
he
had
to
appear,
otherwise,
he
would
lose
his
opportunity
to
make
defense.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
point
was
not
raised
in
the
appeal
taken
to
the
superior
court
appellate
department.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it
was
raised
in
the
state
habeas
corpus.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
state
appeal
was
affirmed.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that’s
correct.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
he
seeks
to
abort
the
state
for
prosecution.
he
has
already
been
tried
and
sentenced
and
has
exhausted
what
would
be
the
--
all
of
the
available
state
court
remedies
in
california.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
he
has
exhausted.
he
has
tendered
to
the
state
courts
in
his
state
habeas
petitions.
the
issues
that
he
seeks
to
raise
here.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
timing
on
this
is
that
he
filed
an
appeal
from
the
conviction.
that
appeal
was
affirmed.
he
then
raised
on
petition
for
rehearing
or
for
certification,
the
issues
of
lack
of
adequate
representation
and
conviction
in
absentia.
that
was
denied.
he
then
filed
habeas
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
and
that
was
denied.
he
then
filed
an
original
habeas
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
that
was
denied.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
then
subsequently,
in
june
of
1970
he
filed
a
federal
habeas
after
there
were
no
other
procedures
available
in
the
state.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
first
issue,
i
would
think
that
the
federal
habeas
judge
would
entertain
is
the
question
of
deliberate
bypass
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
hensley
intentionally
relinquished
his
opportunity
to
appear
and
to
raise
any
defense
and
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
it
would
appear
that
the
first
amendment
issue
might
not
be
reached
until
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
as
to
whether
or
not
hensley
deliberately
absented
himself
from
the
state
trial
court
would
be
resolved.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
not
to
my
knowledge,
i
think
he
has
not.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
because
the
state
trial
judge
continually
granted
stays,
keeping
mr.
hensley
on
recognizance
[voice
overlap].
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
state
trial
judge
granted
a
state
pending
appeal.
he
granted
another
state
pending
--
state
habeas
applications.
he
granted
another
stay
pending,
a
federal
habeas
corpus.
and
after
the
federal
habeas
was
denied,
he
granted
a
stay
for
about
two
weeks
at
which
one
mr.
justice
black
granted
an
eight-day
stay.
mr.
justice
douglas
granted
a
two-week
stay
and
then
a
stay
pending
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
was
granted.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
except
for
the
fact
that
he’s
going
to
serve
one
year
in
jail
if
he
does
not
get
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
the
basis
of
our
argument
is
that
term
in
custody
used
by
congress
relates
to
the
class
of
cases
not
the
timing
as
to
when
the
petition
must
be
filed.
the
state’s
argument
here
is
not
based
upon
any
legitimate
needs
of
federal
judicial
administration.
it’s
not
based
upon
any
law
enforcement
needs
but
is
based
strictly
upon
an
outmoded
conceptual
definition.
in
this
case,
if
the
habeas
petition
is
not
permitted
to
be
filed
while
he’s
on
recognizance,
he
will
file
it
when
he’s
in
custody,
there’ll
be
the
same
number
of
federal
habeas
petitions.
there
will
not
be
an
increase
in
the
federal
case
law.
secondly,
if
he
is
not
committed
to
file
the
habeas
while
he
is
on
recognizance
and
must
go
into
jail,
there
would
be
more
pressure
on
the
district
court
to
move
more
quickly,
to
hear
the
case.
whereas
if
he’s
on
recognizance
granted
by
the
state
trial
judge,
the
federal
court
can
hear
the
thing
in
a
more
leisurely
fashioned.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
peyton
versus
rowe,
it’s
in
everyone’s
interest
to
hear
the
habeas
corpus
application.
it’s
in
the
state’s
interest.
it’s
in
the
petitioner’s
interest.
it’s
in
the
court’s
interest.
in
fact,
it
will
cost
the
state
money
to
incarcerate
this
person
unnecessarily,
perhaps.
if
it
turns
out
that
the
federal
rights
are
involved,
there
will
be
irretrievably
loss.
there’s
absolutely
no
reason
to
commend
the
result
urged
by
the
state
in
this
case.
in
peyton
versus
rowe,
this
court
allowed
the
use
of
anticipatory
attack
upon
a
future
sentence.
in
jones
versus
cunningham,
it
was
unnecessary
to
wait
until
parole
was
revoked
before
jones
could
bring
the
habeas.
in
strait
versus
laird,
it
was
unnecessary
to
wait
until
the
servicemen
were
reactivated
before
he
could
bring
his
conscientious
objector
application.
in
this
case,
we
deal
not
with
the
question
of
a
district
court’s
discretion
but
simply
with
the
question
of
power.
there
is
no
need
here,
for
example,
for
the
federal
court
to
determine
if
bail
should
be
granted
because
the
state
trial
judge
has
already
granted
the
stay
while
he
exhausts
the
federal
habeas.
this
is
the
reverse
situation
of
the
case
in
the
california
supreme
court
called
in
re
smiley.
there,
a
federal
court
granted
on
recognizance
release
and
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
they
had
jurisdiction
to
grant
habeas
relief.
they
said,
if
they
have
the
authority
to
release
the
person,
there
was
no
reason
why
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
them
to
say
they
lack
authority
merely
because
someone
else
has
done
it
for
them.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
of
course,
that
issue
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
--is
not
presented
now,
mr.
chief
justice
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
if
the
case
is
remanded
back
to
the
district
court,
the
first
question
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
answer
is
whether
or
not
hensley
made
a
deliberate
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
after
we
crossed
that,
the
question
then
is
whether
or
not
he
was
deprived
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
by
losing
his
right
to
present
substantial
statutory
as
well
as
constitutional
defenses.
there’s
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
california
statute
applies
to
a
church
granting
honorary
doctor
of
divinity
degrees,
and
that
issue
was
never
litigated
because
he
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
appear
in
the
time
that
we
raised
it.
so,--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
municipal
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
thought
you
meant
with
respect
to
the
stay
that
was
granted.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
he
is
under
the
eminent
control
of
the
sheriff
who
would
be
the
person
who
runs
the
local
jail
to
whom
hensley
would
have
to
surrender.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
has
to
surrender
as
soon
as
the
stay
expires.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
nothing
but
however,
there’s
interesting
parallel
between
this
situation
and
the
situation
of
jones
versus
cunningham
where
this
court
pointed
out
the
jones
could
be
rearrested
at
anytime
the
parole
officer
felt
that
he
violated
his
parole.
under
the
california
statute,
the
o.r.
or
recognizance
could
be
revoked
presumably
without
the
same
type
of
procedural
due
process
as
the
trial.
and
hensley
could
be
taken
any
day
if
it
were
not
for
the
stay
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
by
the
sheriff
and
incarcerated
in
his
jail.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it
constitutes
--
well,
it
pretty
constitute
a
contempt.
it
certainly
constitutes
a
separate
crime.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
oh,
yes,
in
california
it’s
a
crime.
it
constitutes
a
separate
offense
and
if
he’s
caught
outside
the
jurisdiction,
extradition
is
automatically
waived.
and
under
those
circumstances,
it’s
not
a
restraint
to
not
share
it
by
the
public,
generally.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
submit
that
it
is
a
very
real
difference.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it’s
not
like
parole
in
this
sense
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
taken
away
so
easily
without
notice,
perhaps.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
is
under
the
--
under
the
imminent
incarceration,
the
threat
of
incarceration
at
any
time.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
man
is
indicted,
[voice
overlap]
he
can’t
bring
habeas
because
he
hasn’t
exhausted
his
state
court
remedies.
hensley
has
run
the
string
out.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
of
course.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
because
he
hasn’t
exhausted
the
state
court
remedies.
the
doctrine
of
prematurity
would
take
care
of
cases
like
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
was
taken
from
the
statute.
right.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that’s
true.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
is
not
--
that’s
true
and
it’s
not
but
we
don’t
think
that
the
absence
of
territorial
restrictions
is
that
meaningful,
if
one
looks
at
strait
versus
laird,
for
example.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
i
said
the
only
restriction.
he
owes
them
a
year.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
is
the
only
restriction
that’s
present
in
the
sense
that
the
restriction
that
he
has
to
serve
a
year
would
be
a
term
to
be
in
future.
however,
that
may
be
just
a
manifestable
way
of
looking
at
it
because
may
be
--
maybe
that’s
tomorrow
that
he
has
to
serve
for
a
year.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
restrictions
are
--
well,
as
the
california
statute
points
out,
he
is
required
to
appear
whenever
the
judge
requires
him
to
come
in
and
that
in
default
he
waives
extradition
that
it’s
an
offense
if
he
doesn’t
show
up.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
he’s
got
an
outstanding
detainer,
a
one
year
sentence.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
he
owes
a
fine.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
don’t
think
he’s
ordered
stand
permitted
in
default
of
payment,
but
we
think
that
the
fact
that
he
owes
that
one
year
sentence.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
my
argument
is
restricted
to
a
man
who
had
been
convicted
and
had
been
sentenced
for
imprisonment.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
and
who
has
exhausted
the
state
remedies.
we
don’t
deal
with
the
situation
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
right,
i’m
not
dealing
with
the
situation
of
a
person
who
has
merely
fined.
i’m
not
dealing
with
the
situation
of
a
person
who’s
already
served
the
sentence
and
who
just
complains
about
the
civil
disabilities
that
come
from
conviction
because
this
situation
evolves
the
most
graphic
type
of
deprivation
namely
imprisonment.
and
the
court
need
not
reached
the
other
question
particularly
the
question
raised
in
the
united
states
ex
rel.
meyer
versus
weil
which
is
the
seventh
circuit
case
where
the
supreme
court
denied
cert.
last
month.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
in
that
case,
the
prison
had
filed
a
habeas.
he
had
just
been
fined.
he
raised
a
free-speech
question.
the
seventh
circuit
said
he
was
not
in
sufficient
custody.
the
problem
was
he
had
posted
10%
under
the
illinois
statute
which
could
have
been
set
off
against
the
fine,
so
he
never
would’ve
done
any
time
in
jail.
there’s
no
anticipatory
incarceration
possible.
whereas
in
this
case,
of
course,
that
one
year
is
staring
him
in
the
face,
and
if
he
doesn’t
get
relief
from
the
federal
habeas
court,
he
will
be
in
jail.
and
of
course,
if
he
is
in
jail,
everyday
that
he
suffers
in
jail
that
may
turn
out
to
be
unconstitutionally
imposed.
that
would
be
irretrievable.
he
will
never
be
able
to
get
anything
out
of
that.
moreover,
if
we’re
dealing
with
cases
involving
very
short
sentence
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
don’t
have
that
probability
as
this
court
in
shuttlesworth
did
state
that
the
federal
court
have
a
power
to
do
that.
it
is
true
that
the
in
this
case,
the
state
court
must
have
thought
enough
about
the
issues
and
perhaps
hensley’s
non-dangerousness
to
allow
him
to
remain
on
a
recognizance
for
such
a
long
period
of
time.
and
whether
he’s
being
considered
a
charitable
or
just
what
is
legally
necessary,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
he
has
not
been
recalled.
he
could
be.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
but
the
situation
we
deal
with
here
is
where
a
state
judge
has
granted
the
stay.
under
such
circumstances,
we
find
that
it
would
be
no
reason
why
the
federal
judge
should
deny
or
asked
you
power
to
hear
when
the
very
reason
for
the
state
court
allowing
the
man
to
stay
is
so
the
federal
judge
can
hear
the
petition
without
being
presented
with
stay
applications
or
other
types
of
emergency
request
for
immediate
relief.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
don’t
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
state
court
is
required
under
any
consideration
of
supremacy
or
federalism
to
grant
such
a
stay.
that
would
seem
to
be
entirely
a
matter
of
discretion
and
if
he
decides
not
to
grant
the
stay,
then
the
petitioner
would
have
to
ask
the
district
court
for
that
stay.
but
that
was
unnecessary
in
this
case
because
the
state
granted
it.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
record
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
powell,
page
12
(a)
of
paragraph
8
of
the
return
to
the
order
of
the
show
course,
the
state
indicates,
“he
is
at
liberty
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.”
and
on
page
19
(a)
of
the
record,
it
indicates
that
stay
was
granted
by
judge
nelson
who
was
the
judge
of
the
municipal
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
realized
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
--
it
sounds
extremely
illogical
because
the
whole
purpose
of
granting
the
stay
was
to
allow
him
to
do
it
and
now
by
the
state
judge
having
allowed
him
to
do
that,
then
the
federal
judge
says
he
can’t
do
that.
there
is
a
sort
of
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
oh,
i
think
that
perhaps
that
he
was.
but
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
i
did
have
copies,
actual
copies
of
the
state
order
granted
by
the
state
court.
if
the
court
would
wish
i
could
leave
copies
with
the
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that’s
true,
that’s
what
they’re
saying
but
the
juxtaposition
of
the
two
sentences
perhaps
better
than
anything
demonstrates
the
illogic
of
their
position.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
mr.
justice
powell,
the
order
granted
by
the
state
court
is
a
one-page
order
that
simply
says
it’s
order
that
the
sentence
given
to
the
petitioners
identified
is
hereby
stayed
pending
determination
of
the
petitioner’s
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
we
would
submit
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
is
asking
mr.
hensley
to
go
through
a
meaningless
ritual
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
serves
no
legitimate
purpose.
it
does
not
serve
judicial
administration.
it
does
not
serve
the
state’s
interest
and
it
certainly
doesn’t
serve
the
petitioner’s
interest
to
be
incarcerated
under
such
circumstances
before
he
can
file
where
in
fact,
we
have
imprisonment,
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
involved
here,
under
such
circumstances,
it
is
clear
that
the
federal
habeas
court
did
have
authority
and
that
mr.
hensley
was
in
sufficient
custody
to
be
able
to
invoke
the
writ.
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
for
the
record,
after
the
federal
habeas
was
denied,
the
state
trial
judge
then
granted
another
stay
of
about
12
days
and
that
was
the
stay
that
kept
him
out
until
mr.
justice
black
acted
on
august
the
12th.
the
habeas
petition
was
denied
on
july
31,
so
that
the
--
there
was
dovetailing
throughout
of
stay
orders
that
were
granted
by
the
state
trial
judge
before
the
federal
judge
did
know.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
thought
it
was
a
meaningless
ritual
for
the
petitioner
to
have
to
go
through.
i
also
have
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
i
thought
that
it
would
be
an
extremely
inadequate
remedy
to
suggest
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
surrender
either
into
the
anteroom
or
to
the
institution
of
confinement
and
then
he
could
probably
be
bailed
by
a
federal
judge.
the
two
circuits,
the
fifth
and
the
eighth
circuit
that
decided
the
issue
the
other
way,
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit,
both
involved
civil
rights
cases
coming
out
of
itself.
and
it
was
no
accident
that
in
those
cases
it
was
extremely
important
that
the
person
who
is
still
out
on
some
sort
of
former
release
be
allowed
to
seek
vindication
in
the
federal
courts
in
a
timely
fashion.
and
we
submit
that
there
really
is
no
reason
other
than
just
a
definitional
one
which
is
outmoded,
and
we
think
has
been
superseded
by
strait
versus
laird
and
all
of
the
pervious
cases
that
this
person
can
be
considered
in
custody
for
