mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
in
its
questions
i
think
is
struck
upon
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
an
individual,
who
for
whatever
reason
is
not
yet
in
custody,
is
a
prisoner,
can
petition
a
federal
court
for
habeas
corpus.
the
sections
that
are
cited
in
my
brief
are
very
clear.
the
preamble
says
that
a
prisoner
may
petition
for
habeas
corpus
when
he
is
in
custody
and
the
federal
constitution
that
goes
on
to
set
forth
the
other
areas.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
until
such
time
as
either
the
defendant
is
acquitted
or
until
such
time
as
the
completion
of
the
sentence,
if
one
has
imposed,
is
completed,
including
any
period
of
probation.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
until
such
time
as
the
execution
of
the
sentence
begins.
it
seems
to
me
is
a
very
unusual
circumstance
that
we’re
confronted
with
here.
but
until
such
time
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
at
the
termination
of
the
trial
or
the
termination
of
the
sentence.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
not
if
the
sentence
is
stayed
as
such.
if
there
is
no
stay
of
execution,
yes,
termination
of
the
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
no,
not
volitionally.
the
judge
could
not.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
at
the
request
of
the
defendant,
he
could.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
believe
he
could.
if
the
defendant
requests
that
the
court
refrain
from
imposing
sentence
or
for
having
that
sentence
executed,
at
the
defendant’s
request,
the
defendant
had
suffered
no
prejudice
by
the
system
but
rather
with
his
own
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
no.
but
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
defendant
was
sentenced
and
the
judge
in
the
trial
court
granted
a
stay
to
permit
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
refrain
from
going
into
custody
until
such
time
as
his
appeals
have
been
terminated.
mr.
stromer,
the
counsel
who
is
representing
the
defendant
at
the
time
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petitions
first
filed,
notified
judge
nelson
the
fact
that
he
was
in
fact
filing
a
petition
with
the
federal
district
court
in
san
jose
with
judge
peckham
and
judge
nelson
as
a
result
of
the
request
made
by
mr.
stromer,
delayed
and
stayed
temporarily
the
execution
of
the
sentence
thereby
continuing
mr.
hensley
and
his
own
recognizance.
thereafter,
the
judges
of
this
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
continued
to
stay
the
proceedings.
we
are
now
almost
at
the
fourth
anniversary
of
the
time
the
alleged
offense
took
place.
counsel
in
his
statement
indicates
that
the
state
has
no
legitimate
interest
whether
or
not
the
defendant
goes
into
custody
at
this
time
or
some
future
time.
and
i
would
respectfully
defer
with
that.
the
state
has
a
very
substantial
interest.
as
any
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
so
to
as
the
state
have
a
right
to
a
prompt
an
expeditious
execution
of
sentence.
otherwise,
that
the
purpose
of
sentence
doesn’t
do
anything.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
only
up
till
1970,
thereafter,
it
was
the
federal
courts
and
the
justices
of
this
court
and
other
courts
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
prevented
the
municipal
court
from
acting.
and
at
this
point
in
time,
the
defendant
has
been
out
of
custody
following
in
the
imposition
of
sentence
some
three-and-a-half
years.
it
just
does
not
seem
appropriate.
the
fact
that
the
petitioned
for
writ
habeas
corpus
initially
was
devised
as
a
system,
as
a
means
to
have
a
prompt
in
expeditious
examination
of
a
detention
by
a
defendant,
generally,
before
trial
has
been
expanded
by
the
legislature,
by
congress
to
permit
a
means
while
after
conviction
when
an
individual
is
in
custody,
is
a
prisoner
to
have
the
courts
examine
that
detention.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
the
--
that
could’ve
been
done
if
the
federal
courts
had
wanted
to
do
that,
that
is
if
the
defendant
had
gone
into
custody,
there
is
machinery
whereby
when
a
petitioner
files
a
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court,
he
can
be
released
by
the
federal
courts.
but
here,
because
of
the
--
judge
nelson
wanting
to
do
the
defendant
a
favor
if
you
will,
and
mr.
stromer
continued
temporarily
or
stayed
temporarily
until
such
time
as
there
was
a
consideration
of
the
habeas
petition
by
the
federal
district
court.
thereafter,
the
matter
was
taken
out
of
judge
nelson’s
hands
by
the
subsequent
stays
that
were
issued
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
by
this
court.
and
it
reverts
back
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
or
the
federal
courts
can
exceed
the
authority
that
is
granted
to
it
by
the
legislature,
by
the
statute
authorizing
the
issuance
of
habeas
corpus.
the
statute
is
clear.
it
relates
to
a
prisoner
and
it
relates
to
someone
in
custody.
now,
the
court
has
regularly
defined
or
expanded
on
what
is
custody,
what
status
someone
has
to
be
in,
in
order
to
be
in
custody.
in
jones,
it
indicated
that
a
parolee
is
in
custody
because
he
can’t
drive
a
car,
he
can’t
work
without
the
permission
of
the
parole
officer,
he
can’t
go
places
or
do
things.
he
is
in
custody.
not
necessarily
with
bars
around
him
but
nonetheless,
restricted.
this
defendant
in
this
case,
his
whereabouts
are
totally
unknown,
at
least
as
far
as
the
people
are
concerned.
he
can
be
sitting
in
this
courtroom.
he
can
be
out
of
the
country.
he
is
operating
his
business
and
there
is
no
restriction
on
any
of
his
activities
whatsoever,
except
one
that
with
the
lawful
order
of
court,
he
shall
surrender
back
to
the
court.
and
that
i
don’t
feel
is
the
type
of
custody,
the
type
of
restraint,
the
type
of
interference
that
is
such
a
magnitude
that
requires
the
invocation
of
the
habeas
corpus.
it
doesn’t
qualify
for
that
custody
that
is
required
by
federal
habeas
corpus.
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
is
under
whose
control
is
the
defendant
presently?
and
that
i
think,
similarly
procedurally
presents
a
very
interesting
question.
counsel
responded
he
is
under
the
control
of
the
municipal
court.
the
municipal
court
has
no
power
over
the
defendant
at
this
time.
it
cannot
lawfully
order
anything
respecting
the
defendant
because
the
court
is
precluded
from
that
by
a
stay
granted
within
the
federal
system.
and
the
sheriff
is
under
no
--
has
no
control
over
the
defendant.
he
cannot
volitionally
go
out
and
seize
the
defendant
or
arrest
the
defendant
or
do
anything
with
respect
to
him.
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
addressed
to
the
sentencing
municipal
court.
and
it
is
not
properly
any
person
or
any
entity
that
has
the
control
over
the
defendant.
and
i
would
submit
that
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
once
he
goes
into
custody
and
once
he
is
in
custody,
then
the
right
accrues
to
file
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
if
the
district
court
at
that
time
wanted
to
exercise
its
discretion,
yes
it
could.
but
that
presents
the
question
that
maybe
a
more
desirable
system,
it
may
well
be
that
it
might,
the
system
should
have
a
procedure
whereby
someone
who
is
in
imminent
danger
of
going
into
custody
can
have
access
to
federal
habeas
corpus
and
if
the
congress
so
desires,
then
they
want
to
pass
legislation
which
would
permit
that.
but
under
the
present
status
of
the
law,
the
congress
has
not
gone
so
far
and
they
still
require
in
the
legislation
that
the
person
be
in
custody.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
at
the
time
that
you
appear,
you’re
responding
to
court’s
order
but
i
don’t
believe
that
you
are
in
custody
of
that
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
if
it’s
a
willful
failure
to
appear,
you
may
very
well
be
in
contempt
of
that
court.
you
may
well
be
in
violation
of
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
not
at
that
time
if
it
would
be
--
the
defendant
could
be
anywhere
at
that
time.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
a
different
offense
under
the
california
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
under
the
california
recognizance
release.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
a
defendant
in
order
to
be
released
on
his
own
recognizance
relinquishes
certain
rights.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
generally
speaking,
when
someone
is
released
on
bail
and
aren’t
in
california,
there
is
no
territorial
restriction.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
would
think
if
the
court
at
this
time,
if
the
municipal
court
were
to
issue
an
order
requiring
the
defendant
to
appear
tomorrow,
at
its
court
and
the
defendant
chose
not
to
appear
that
that
would
violate
no
law,
that
the
defendant
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
that
because
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
issue
such
an
order.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
because
of
the
federal
court’s
stay.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
whichever.
because
of
the
present
status
of
that
case,
the
court
could
not
issue
a
lawful
order
because
it
is
precluded
from
[voice
overlap].
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
no.
i
don’t
think
that
necessarily
follows.
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction,
i
believe
because
the
defendant
was
not
in
custody.
notwithstanding
that
fact,
the
fact
that
the
federal
courts
have
stayed,
the
execution
of
sentence
i
don’t
think
affects
one
way
or
the
other
defendant’s
custodial
status.
i
believe
you
indicated
that
if
the
defendant
were
ordered
to
appear
and
did
not,
would
he
then
not
be
in
custody?
clearly
not.
he
would
be
somewhere,
somewhere
other
than
where
he
was
supposed
to
be
but
not
in
anyone’s
custody.
he
could
not
be
restrained
unless
he
was
found
and
placed
in
custody.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
yes.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
correct
but
that
is
not,
i
feel,
the
type
of
custody
that
requires
the
invocation
of
habeas
corpus.
a
parolee
is
an
individual
who
is
not
only
suffering
from
a
single
requirement
or
a
single
restriction
on
his
daily
existence.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
jones,
suffering
from
a
whole
range
of
prohibitions
with
respect
to
job,
family,
his
domicile,
who
he
can
associate
with,
where
he
can
go
and
where
he
can’t
go.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
if
it’s
properly
served
upon
him,
yes.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
under
counsel’s
argument,
i
think
it
would
be
because
if
any
individual
is
subjected
to
an
order
of
court,
the
violation
for
which
would
result
in
the
possible
incarceration
of
a
person
which
if
an
individual
willfully
violates
a
proper
subpoena
or
summon
served
upon
him
could
be
subjected
to
writ,
a
body
attachment
and
be
incarcerated.
and
on
the
counsel’s
argument,
yes,
that
person
would
spontaneously
get
the
right
to
file
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
don’t
know.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
don’t
know.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
for
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
had
that
occurred
--
had
judge
nelson
at
that
time
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
had
there
been
a
remittitur
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california,
re-conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
municipal
court
and
if
at
that
time
judge
nelson
had
declined
to
grant
the
stay
of
execution
of
the
sentence,
the
defendant
would
have
been
at
that
time
been
taken
into
custody
and
thereafter
would
have
been
eligible
to
file
its
petition
for
federal
habeas
corpus
and
his
request
for
release.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
it
would’ve
terminated.
it
had
terminated.
the
stay
had
terminated
because
of
the
decision
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that
--
it
depends
on
which
judge
we
say
would
not
have
a
jurisdiction.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
it
would
depend
which
judge,
a
federal
judge.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
within
the
state.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
procedurally
no
because
there
is
an
automatic
stay
with
the
filing
of
the
petition
with
the
district
court
of
appeal.
the
stay
that
was
granted
by
judge
nelson
was
a
stay
up
until
the
time
that
the
appellant
division
of
the
superior
court
either
affirmed
or
denied
the
case.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
there
was
no
intervention
by
the
federal
district
judge
in
the
custodial
status
of
the
defendant.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
but
under
my
theory
–
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
under
–
well,
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
convicted.
he
appealed
to
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
where
the
conviction
was
affirmed.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
there
was
a
request
for
certification
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
which
was
denied.
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed
in
the
state
and
the
district
court
of
appeal
denied.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
and
by
the
operation
of
the
law.
that’s
correct.
and
it
was
a
petition
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
again
for
habeas
corpus
which
was
similarly
denied.
that
time,
there
would
have
been
a
remittitur
30
some
more
days
following
the
determination
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
and
automatically,
the
man
would’ve
gone
to
jail.
the
day
that
that
would’ve
occurred,
mr.
stromer
went
to
judge
nelson
and
indicated
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
process
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
he
was
the
trial
judge
in
the
municipal
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
stromer,
the
defendant’s
counsel
of
that
time,
went
to
judge
nelson
and
said,
“we
are
filing
now
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
before
the
federal
court.
please,
can
we
keep
mr.
hensley
out
until
such
time
as
the
federal
court’s
got
the
case?”
and
judge
nelson
being
a
magnanimous
individual,
agreed
to
do
that.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
unaware
of
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
it
was
never
even
brought
up
whether
or
not
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
to
hear
the
case.
the
impression
at
that
time
was
at
the
ninth
circuit
rather
that
the
federal
district
court
judge
peckham
would
consider
the
petition
and
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
at
the
time
for
the
return
for
the
order
to
show
cause
why
the
petition
should
not
be
granted.
i
brought
up
that
question
at
the
court,
did
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
at
that
time,
the
federal
courts
then
by
granting
stays
continued
the
defendant
on
his
own
recognizance.
had
the
federal
courts
not
at
that
time
at
the
ninth
circuit
or
justices
of
this
court,
interfered
at
that
time,
the
defendant
similarly
would
have
gone
in
custody
and
that
time,
would’ve
been
eligible
for
federal
habeas
corpus.
it
may
be
as
secured
as
root
and
maybe
that
regardless
of
the
verdict
of
this
court,
in
this
case,
the
matter
is
going
to
go
back
to
judge
peckham
even
the
defendant
will
be
in
custody
when
that
happens
or
he’ll
be
out
of
custody.
but
whether
or
not
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
in
jail.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
to
keep
him
out.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
all
the
appeal
rights
of
the
defendant
have
ruled
the
state
court
and
collateral
rights.
and
the
whole
question
goes
back
again
to
whether
or
not
this
court
or
the
federal
court
system
has
been
given
the
right
by
the
congress
to
hear
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
judge
peckham
did
not
issue
the
stay
order.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
believe
it
was
justice
black.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
the
defendant
would
have
been
incarcerated.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
because
the
habeas
corpus
was
determined
by
judge
peckham
when
he
dismissed
the
petition
for
one
of
jurisdiction.
and
at
that
time,
a
petition
was
filed
with
justice
black
to
continue
the
defendant
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
a
filing
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
thereafter,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
the
stay
in
term
--
the
terms
of
the
stay
were
conditioned
upon
the
determination
of
the
case
by
the
district
court
in
san
jose,
yes.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
don’t
think
a
state
court
or
a
judge
of
a
state
court
can
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
he
might
do
it
out
of
ignorance.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
depending
of
course
on
how
this
case
is
decided.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
the
law
would
be
clear
at
that
time
because
this
court
had
not
addressed
itself
to
that
question.
it
is
considered
what
certain
circumstances
are
custody
and
what
are
not.
but
it
hasn’t
said
that
an
individual
on
bail
or
an
individual
released
on
his
own
recognizance
whether
that
person
is
or
is
not
deemed
to
be
in
custody.
the
california
courts
recognized
the
doctrine
of
constructive
custody.
that
is
a
person
out
on
bail
on
his
own
recognizance
is
deemed
to
be
in
custody.
but
i
analogize
that
to
somebody
being
a
little
bit
pregnant.
you’re
not.
either
you
are
or
you’re
not
and
i
think
that
the
federal
law
requires
that
the
person
is
in
jail.
now,
it
may
be
an
antiquated
doctrine,
it
may
not
be.
i
feel,
that’s
what
the
congress
has
intended
and
if
they
intended
something
different,
they
all
would
set
something
different.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
think
jones
went
so
far
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
appreciate
that
but
jail
can
mean
different
things.
a
parolee
and
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
other
types
of
people,
although
may
be
not
behind
bars
are
still
in
custody
because
their
lives
are
not
their
own.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
yes.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
would
not.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
absolutely.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
because
the
statute
said
so.
2241
then
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
court.
now,
this
court
obviously
has
the
power
to
say
an
individual
who
released
on
his
own
recognizance
is
in
custody
but
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
2241.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
the
critical
time
is
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
if
he
is
in
at
that
time,
the
courts
have
jurisdiction.
if
he
is
out
at
that
time,
the
court
is
no
or
at
least
the
federal
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
waiting
to
go
in.
that
would
be
my
view.
again,
it
may
be
a
very
narrow
construction
of
the
law
of
the
rule.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
possibly.
i
don’t
know.
but
the
petition
in
this
case
was
filed
under
2241
at
a
habeas
corpus
under
(c)
(3).
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
appreciate
that
but
i
think
what
the
defendant
is
doing
in
this
case
is
it’s
intending
to
have
the
federal
courts
act
as
a
super
appellate
review
by
way
of
written
on
nature
of
coram
nobis
to
get
the
matter
heard
as
an
appeal
rather
than
a
habeas
corpus.
was
that
as
various,
in
my
view
very
precise
meanings
and
very
précised
requirements?
which
requirements
have
not
been
met
by
this
defendant
in
this
case?
thank
you.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
in
its
questions
i
think
is
struck
upon
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
an
individual,
who
for
whatever
reason
is
not
yet
in
custody,
is
a
prisoner,
can
petition
a
federal
court
for
habeas
corpus.
the
sections
that
are
cited
in
my
brief
are
very
clear.
the
preamble
says
that
a
prisoner
may
petition
for
habeas
corpus
when
he
is
in
custody
and
the
federal
constitution
that
goes
on
to
set
forth
the
other
areas.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
until
such
time
as
either
the
defendant
is
acquitted
or
until
such
time
as
the
completion
of
the
sentence,
if
one
has
imposed,
is
completed,
including
any
period
of
probation.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
until
such
time
as
the
execution
of
the
sentence
begins.
it
seems
to
me
is
a
very
unusual
circumstance
that
we’re
confronted
with
here.
but
until
such
time
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
at
the
termination
of
the
trial
or
the
termination
of
the
sentence.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
not
if
the
sentence
is
stayed
as
such.
if
there
is
no
stay
of
execution,
yes,
termination
of
the
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
no,
not
volitionally.
the
judge
could
not.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
at
the
request
of
the
defendant,
he
could.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
believe
he
could.
if
the
defendant
requests
that
the
court
refrain
from
imposing
sentence
or
for
having
that
sentence
executed,
at
the
defendant’s
request,
the
defendant
had
suffered
no
prejudice
by
the
system
but
rather
with
his
own
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
no.
but
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
defendant
was
sentenced
and
the
judge
in
the
trial
court
granted
a
stay
to
permit
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
refrain
from
going
into
custody
until
such
time
as
his
appeals
have
been
terminated.
mr.
stromer,
the
counsel
who
is
representing
the
defendant
at
the
time
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petitions
first
filed,
notified
judge
nelson
the
fact
that
he
was
in
fact
filing
a
petition
with
the
federal
district
court
in
san
jose
with
judge
peckham
and
judge
nelson
as
a
result
of
the
request
made
by
mr.
stromer,
delayed
and
stayed
temporarily
the
execution
of
the
sentence
thereby
continuing
mr.
hensley
and
his
own
recognizance.
thereafter,
the
judges
of
this
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
continued
to
stay
the
proceedings.
we
are
now
almost
at
the
fourth
anniversary
of
the
time
the
alleged
offense
took
place.
counsel
in
his
statement
indicates
that
the
state
has
no
legitimate
interest
whether
or
not
the
defendant
goes
into
custody
at
this
time
or
some
future
time.
and
i
would
respectfully
defer
with
that.
the
state
has
a
very
substantial
interest.
as
any
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
so
to
as
the
state
have
a
right
to
a
prompt
an
expeditious
execution
of
sentence.
otherwise,
that
the
purpose
of
sentence
doesn’t
do
anything.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
only
up
till
1970,
thereafter,
it
was
the
federal
courts
and
the
justices
of
this
court
and
other
courts
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
prevented
the
municipal
court
from
acting.
and
at
this
point
in
time,
the
defendant
has
been
out
of
custody
following
in
the
imposition
of
sentence
some
three-and-a-half
years.
it
just
does
not
seem
appropriate.
the
fact
that
the
petitioned
for
writ
habeas
corpus
initially
was
devised
as
a
system,
as
a
means
to
have
a
prompt
in
expeditious
examination
of
a
detention
by
a
defendant,
generally,
before
trial
has
been
expanded
by
the
legislature,
by
congress
to
permit
a
means
while
after
conviction
when
an
individual
is
in
custody,
is
a
prisoner
to
have
the
courts
examine
that
detention.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
the
--
that
could’ve
been
done
if
the
federal
courts
had
wanted
to
do
that,
that
is
if
the
defendant
had
gone
into
custody,
there
is
machinery
whereby
when
a
petitioner
files
a
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court,
he
can
be
released
by
the
federal
courts.
but
here,
because
of
the
--
judge
nelson
wanting
to
do
the
defendant
a
favor
if
you
will,
and
mr.
stromer
continued
temporarily
or
stayed
temporarily
until
such
time
as
there
was
a
consideration
of
the
habeas
petition
by
the
federal
district
court.
thereafter,
the
matter
was
taken
out
of
judge
nelson’s
hands
by
the
subsequent
stays
that
were
issued
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
by
this
court.
and
it
reverts
back
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
or
the
federal
courts
can
exceed
the
authority
that
is
granted
to
it
by
the
legislature,
by
the
statute
authorizing
the
issuance
of
habeas
corpus.
the
statute
is
clear.
it
relates
to
a
prisoner
and
it
relates
to
someone
in
custody.
now,
the
court
has
regularly
defined
or
expanded
on
what
is
custody,
what
status
someone
has
to
be
in,
in
order
to
be
in
custody.
in
jones,
it
indicated
that
a
parolee
is
in
custody
because
he
can’t
drive
a
car,
he
can’t
work
without
the
permission
of
the
parole
officer,
he
can’t
go
places
or
do
things.
he
is
in
custody.
not
necessarily
with
bars
around
him
but
nonetheless,
restricted.
this
defendant
in
this
case,
his
whereabouts
are
totally
unknown,
at
least
as
far
as
the
people
are
concerned.
he
can
be
sitting
in
this
courtroom.
he
can
be
out
of
the
country.
he
is
operating
his
business
and
there
is
no
restriction
on
any
of
his
activities
whatsoever,
except
one
that
with
the
lawful
order
of
court,
he
shall
surrender
back
to
the
court.
and
that
i
don’t
feel
is
the
type
of
custody,
the
type
of
restraint,
the
type
of
interference
that
is
such
a
magnitude
that
requires
the
invocation
of
the
habeas
corpus.
it
doesn’t
qualify
for
that
custody
that
is
required
by
federal
habeas
corpus.
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
is
under
whose
control
is
the
defendant
presently?
and
that
i
think,
similarly
procedurally
presents
a
very
interesting
question.
counsel
responded
he
is
under
the
control
of
the
municipal
court.
the
municipal
court
has
no
power
over
the
defendant
at
this
time.
it
cannot
lawfully
order
anything
respecting
the
defendant
because
the
court
is
precluded
from
that
by
a
stay
granted
within
the
federal
system.
and
the
sheriff
is
under
no
--
has
no
control
over
the
defendant.
he
cannot
volitionally
go
out
and
seize
the
defendant
or
arrest
the
defendant
or
do
anything
with
respect
to
him.
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
addressed
to
the
sentencing
municipal
court.
and
it
is
not
properly
any
person
or
any
entity
that
has
the
control
over
the
defendant.
and
i
would
submit
that
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
once
he
goes
into
custody
and
once
he
is
in
custody,
then
the
right
accrues
to
file
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
if
the
district
court
at
that
time
wanted
to
exercise
its
discretion,
yes
it
could.
but
that
presents
the
question
that
maybe
a
more
desirable
system,
it
may
well
be
that
it
might,
the
system
should
have
a
procedure
whereby
someone
who
is
in
imminent
danger
of
going
into
custody
can
have
access
to
federal
habeas
corpus
and
if
the
congress
so
desires,
then
they
want
to
pass
legislation
which
would
permit
that.
but
under
the
present
status
of
the
law,
the
congress
has
not
gone
so
far
and
they
still
require
in
the
legislation
that
the
person
be
in
custody.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
at
the
time
that
you
appear,
you’re
responding
to
court’s
order
but
i
don’t
believe
that
you
are
in
custody
of
that
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
if
it’s
a
willful
failure
to
appear,
you
may
very
well
be
in
contempt
of
that
court.
you
may
well
be
in
violation
of
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
not
at
that
time
if
it
would
be
--
the
defendant
could
be
anywhere
at
that
time.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
a
different
offense
under
the
california
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
under
the
california
recognizance
release.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
a
defendant
in
order
to
be
released
on
his
own
recognizance
relinquishes
certain
rights.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
generally
speaking,
when
someone
is
released
on
bail
and
aren’t
in
california,
there
is
no
territorial
restriction.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
would
think
if
the
court
at
this
time,
if
the
municipal
court
were
to
issue
an
order
requiring
the
defendant
to
appear
tomorrow,
at
its
court
and
the
defendant
chose
not
to
appear
that
that
would
violate
no
law,
that
the
defendant
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
that
because
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
issue
such
an
order.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
because
of
the
federal
court’s
stay.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
whichever.
because
of
the
present
status
of
that
case,
the
court
could
not
issue
a
lawful
order
because
it
is
precluded
from
[voice
overlap].
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
no.
i
don’t
think
that
necessarily
follows.
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction,
i
believe
because
the
defendant
was
not
in
custody.
notwithstanding
that
fact,
the
fact
that
the
federal
courts
have
stayed,
the
execution
of
sentence
i
don’t
think
affects
one
way
or
the
other
defendant’s
custodial
status.
i
believe
you
indicated
that
if
the
defendant
were
ordered
to
appear
and
did
not,
would
he
then
not
be
in
custody?
clearly
not.
he
would
be
somewhere,
somewhere
other
than
where
he
was
supposed
to
be
but
not
in
anyone’s
custody.
he
could
not
be
restrained
unless
he
was
found
and
placed
in
custody.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
yes.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
correct
but
that
is
not,
i
feel,
the
type
of
custody
that
requires
the
invocation
of
habeas
corpus.
a
parolee
is
an
individual
who
is
not
only
suffering
from
a
single
requirement
or
a
single
restriction
on
his
daily
existence.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
jones,
suffering
from
a
whole
range
of
prohibitions
with
respect
to
job,
family,
his
domicile,
who
he
can
associate
with,
where
he
can
go
and
where
he
can’t
go.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
if
it’s
properly
served
upon
him,
yes.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
under
counsel’s
argument,
i
think
it
would
be
because
if
any
individual
is
subjected
to
an
order
of
court,
the
violation
for
which
would
result
in
the
possible
incarceration
of
a
person
which
if
an
individual
willfully
violates
a
proper
subpoena
or
summon
served
upon
him
could
be
subjected
to
writ,
a
body
attachment
and
be
incarcerated.
and
on
the
counsel’s
argument,
yes,
that
person
would
spontaneously
get
the
right
to
file
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
don’t
know.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
don’t
know.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
for
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
had
that
occurred
--
had
judge
nelson
at
that
time
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
had
there
been
a
remittitur
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california,
re-conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
municipal
court
and
if
at
that
time
judge
nelson
had
declined
to
grant
the
stay
of
execution
of
the
sentence,
the
defendant
would
have
been
at
that
time
been
taken
into
custody
and
thereafter
would
have
been
eligible
to
file
its
petition
for
federal
habeas
corpus
and
his
request
for
release.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
it
would’ve
terminated.
it
had
terminated.
the
stay
had
terminated
because
of
the
decision
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that
--
it
depends
on
which
judge
we
say
would
not
have
a
jurisdiction.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
it
would
depend
which
judge,
a
federal
judge.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
within
the
state.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
procedurally
no
because
there
is
an
automatic
stay
with
the
filing
of
the
petition
with
the
district
court
of
appeal.
the
stay
that
was
granted
by
judge
nelson
was
a
stay
up
until
the
time
that
the
appellant
division
of
the
superior
court
either
affirmed
or
denied
the
case.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
there
was
no
intervention
by
the
federal
district
judge
in
the
custodial
status
of
the
defendant.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
but
under
my
theory
–
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
under
–
well,
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
convicted.
he
appealed
to
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
where
the
conviction
was
affirmed.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
there
was
a
request
for
certification
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
which
was
denied.
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed
in
the
state
and
the
district
court
of
appeal
denied.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
and
by
the
operation
of
the
law.
that’s
correct.
and
it
was
a
petition
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
again
for
habeas
corpus
which
was
similarly
denied.
that
time,
there
would
have
been
a
remittitur
30
some
more
days
following
the
determination
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
and
automatically,
the
man
would’ve
gone
to
jail.
the
day
that
that
would’ve
occurred,
mr.
stromer
went
to
judge
nelson
and
indicated
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
process
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
he
was
the
trial
judge
in
the
municipal
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
stromer,
the
defendant’s
counsel
of
that
time,
went
to
judge
nelson
and
said,
“we
are
filing
now
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
before
the
federal
court.
please,
can
we
keep
mr.
hensley
out
until
such
time
as
the
federal
court’s
got
the
case?”
and
judge
nelson
being
a
magnanimous
individual,
agreed
to
do
that.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
unaware
of
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
it
was
never
even
brought
up
whether
or
not
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
to
hear
the
case.
the
impression
at
that
time
was
at
the
ninth
circuit
rather
that
the
federal
district
court
judge
peckham
would
consider
the
petition
and
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
at
the
time
for
the
return
for
the
order
to
show
cause
why
the
petition
should
not
be
granted.
i
brought
up
that
question
at
the
court,
did
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
at
that
time,
the
federal
courts
then
by
granting
stays
continued
the
defendant
on
his
own
recognizance.
had
the
federal
courts
not
at
that
time
at
the
ninth
circuit
or
justices
of
this
court,
interfered
at
that
time,
the
defendant
similarly
would
have
gone
in
custody
and
that
time,
would’ve
been
eligible
for
federal
habeas
corpus.
it
may
be
as
secured
as
root
and
maybe
that
regardless
of
the
verdict
of
this
court,
in
this
case,
the
matter
is
going
to
go
back
to
judge
peckham
even
the
defendant
will
be
in
custody
when
that
happens
or
he’ll
be
out
of
custody.
but
whether
or
not
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
in
jail.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
to
keep
him
out.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
all
the
appeal
rights
of
the
defendant
have
ruled
the
state
court
and
collateral
rights.
and
the
whole
question
goes
back
again
to
whether
or
not
this
court
or
the
federal
court
system
has
been
given
the
right
by
the
congress
to
hear
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
judge
peckham
did
not
issue
the
stay
order.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
believe
it
was
justice
black.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
the
defendant
would
have
been
incarcerated.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
because
the
habeas
corpus
was
determined
by
judge
peckham
when
he
dismissed
the
petition
for
one
of
jurisdiction.
and
at
that
time,
a
petition
was
filed
with
justice
black
to
continue
the
defendant
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
a
filing
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
thereafter,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
the
stay
in
term
--
the
terms
of
the
stay
were
conditioned
upon
the
determination
of
the
case
by
the
district
court
in
san
jose,
yes.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
don’t
think
a
state
court
or
a
judge
of
a
state
court
can
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
well,
he
might
do
it
out
of
ignorance.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
depending
of
course
on
how
this
case
is
decided.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
that’s
correct.
the
law
would
be
clear
at
that
time
because
this
court
had
not
addressed
itself
to
that
question.
it
is
considered
what
certain
circumstances
are
custody
and
what
are
not.
but
it
hasn’t
said
that
an
individual
on
bail
or
an
individual
released
on
his
own
recognizance
whether
that
person
is
or
is
not
deemed
to
be
in
custody.
the
california
courts
recognized
the
doctrine
of
constructive
custody.
that
is
a
person
out
on
bail
on
his
own
recognizance
is
deemed
to
be
in
custody.
but
i
analogize
that
to
somebody
being
a
little
bit
pregnant.
you’re
not.
either
you
are
or
you’re
not
and
i
think
that
the
federal
law
requires
that
the
person
is
in
jail.
now,
it
may
be
an
antiquated
doctrine,
it
may
not
be.
i
feel,
that’s
what
the
congress
has
intended
and
if
they
intended
something
different,
they
all
would
set
something
different.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
think
jones
went
so
far
--
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
appreciate
that
but
jail
can
mean
different
things.
a
parolee
and
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
other
types
of
people,
although
may
be
not
behind
bars
are
still
in
custody
because
their
lives
are
not
their
own.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
yes.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
would
not.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
absolutely.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
because
the
statute
said
so.
2241
then
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
court.
now,
this
court
obviously
has
the
power
to
say
an
individual
who
released
on
his
own
recognizance
is
in
custody
but
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
2241.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
the
critical
time
is
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
if
he
is
in
at
that
time,
the
courts
have
jurisdiction.
if
he
is
out
at
that
time,
the
court
is
no
or
at
least
the
federal
court.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
waiting
to
go
in.
that
would
be
my
view.
again,
it
may
be
a
very
narrow
construction
of
the
law
of
the
rule.
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
possibly.
i
don’t
know.
but
the
petition
in
this
case
was
filed
under
2241
at
a
habeas
corpus
under
(c)
(3).
mr.
dennis
alan
lempert
i
appreciate
that
but
i
think
what
the
defendant
is
doing
in
this
case
is
it’s
intending
to
have
the
federal
courts
act
as
a
super
appellate
review
by
way
of
written
on
nature
of
coram
nobis
to
get
the
matter
heard
as
an
appeal
rather
than
a
habeas
corpus.
was
that
as
various,
in
my
view
very
precise
meanings
and
very
précised
requirements?
which
requirements
have
not
been
met
by
this
defendant
in
this
case?
thank
you.
