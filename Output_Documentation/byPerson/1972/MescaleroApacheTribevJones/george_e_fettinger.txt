mr.
george
e.
fettinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
to
this
court
is,
can
the
state
of
new
mexico
acting
under
state
law
impose
its
compensating
tax
upon
the
use
of
tangible
personal
property
owned
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
and
utilized
on
its
tribal
enterprise
principally
located
outside
of
the
boundaries
of
the
mescalero
reservation
and
can
the
state
of
new
mexico,
acting
under
state
law
validly
impose
its
gross
receipts
tax
under
the
same
circumstances.
the
essential
facts
of
the
case
are
that
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
is
a
treaty
tribe.
it's
present
reservation
boundaries
were
established
by
executive
order.
in
1936,
the
tribe
adopted
its
first
constitution
under
25
u.s.c.
476
which
constitution
was
amended
in
1965.
both
of
these
constitutions
were
duly
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
tribe
is
the
exclusive
owner
and
the
operator
of
sierra
blanca
ski
resort
which
is
located
in
otero
in
lincoln
county
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
the
ski
resort
is
primarily
on
the
lands
belonging
to
the
united
states
forest
service
and
leased
to
tribe
for
a
period
of
30
years.
the
ski
resort
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
not
entirely
so,
sir.
some
of
the
ski
runs
and
ski
trails
are
in
fact
on
the
reservation.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
i
think
we
can
draw
a
many
distinctions
for
that
purpose
and
i
wish
i
can
do
it
now.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
a
minor
one,
sir.
i
think
there
are
more
if
i
--
if
you
wish
me
to
pick
up
the
question
now,
i
will?
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
the
ski
resort
in
fact
is
bordered
on
the
south
by
the
reservation
itself
and
the
ski
enterprise
including
the
lease
with
the
united
states
forest
service
was
entered
into
by
the
tribe
pursuant
to
article
number
11
of
the
constitution
which
constitution
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
a
feasibility
study
was
prepared
and
paid
for
by
the
united
states
government
and
the
purpose
of
the
operation
of
the
ski
resort
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
is
to
raise
revenue
in
lieu
of
taxing
tribal
members
and
also
the
proceeds
are
used
for
the
educational
and
social
and
economic
welfare
of
the
mescalero
apache
people.
the
ski
resort
provides
job
training
for
the
members
of
the
tribe
and
there
are
20
to
30
members
of
the
tribe
who
are,
in
fact,
in
such
a
training
capacity.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
--
well,
yes
sir.
the
ski
run
is
operated
as
a
business
intending
to
train
members
of
the
tribe
to
operate
ski
lifts.
they
maybe
brought
in
the
economic
community
in
the
sense
of
training
for
leasing
ski
boots.
they
maybe
maintenance
personnel.
they
maybe
in
mescalero
conservation
area
grooming
the
ski
trails
and
maybe
slash
removal,
maybe
timbering.
each
of
these
jobs
is
in
a
training
capacity
for
the
individual
attempting
to
upgrade
the
individual
indians.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
the
ski
resort
is
run
under
a
plan
of
operation
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
tribal
council
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
it
is
run
under
that
plan
by
a
board
of
directors.
it
includes
indians
on
that
board.
mr.
chino
is
a
member
of
the
board
and
they
run
that
enterprise
subject
to
the
restrictions
set
forth
in
that
plan
of
operation.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
it
is
run
exclusively
by
indians
in
that
the
plan
of
operation
for
the
ski
run
was
adopted
by
the
tribal
council.
but
under
the
constitution
of
the
tribe,
even
that
plan
of
operation
after
adoption
by
the
tribal
council
is
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
there
are
non-indians
involved
in
the
operation,
yes
sir.
the
manager
for
example
is
not
an
indian
because
(voice
overlap)
qualified
indians
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
fundamentally,
sir.
some
of
them
actually
hold
down
jobs.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
this
case
is
here
on
stipulated
facts,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
this
controversy
arose,
that
was
in
fact
the
case.
since
that
time
circumstances
have
changed
so
that
there
are
employees
involved
who
have
been
longer
term
employees,
but
training
still
is
a
significant
part
of
the
operation
of
the
ski
run.
the
original
purchase
of
this
ski
run,
both
the
land
and
the
--
or
interest
in
the
land,
the
improvements
and
the
new
construction
on
the
ski
run
was
completely
financed
by
a
loan
to
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
under
25
u.s.c.,
section
470.
at
the
ski
resort,
united
states
government
must
approve
the
budget
for
the
fiscal
year,
the
leasing
of
equipment
and
other
property
used
by
the
tribe,
the
leasing
of
facilities
at
the
ski
resort
to
various
concessionaires,
a
plan
and
design
of
any
additional
facilities
or
improvements
to
be
constructed
at
the
ski
resort,
the
disposal
of
any
property
other
than
expendable
items,
the
form
and
the
content
of
monthly
reports,
the
form
and
the
content
of
the
annual
report
and
the
certified
public
accountant
that,
in
fact,
prepares
such
annual
report.
the
bureau
of
revenue
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
conducted
an
audit
in
the
year
1968
and
as
a
result
assessed
compensating
tax
which
is
essentially
an
excise
tax
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$58,000.00
plus
penalty
and
interest.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
sir.
the
compensating
tax
in
new
mexico
applies
to
out
of
state
purchases
brought
into
the
state
and
in
fact
used
there.
in
that
sense
it
can
be
termed
a
used
tax.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
it’s
generally
referred
to
as
an
excise.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
if
the
purchase
was
made
by
the
tribe
for
tribal
purposes
we
would
contend
that
purchase
inside
or
outside
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
would
be
exempt
from
such
a
gross
receipts
or
compensating
tax.
in
this
case,
it
was
purchased
outside
the
state
or
it
would
not
be
under
the
compensating
tax.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
(voice
overlap)
would
say
the
same
thing
about
it.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
if
i
may,
the
new
statutes,
the
statutes
since
this
case
have
been
amended,
in
fact,
at
this
time
if
under
the
state
statute,
if
the
tangible
personal
property
were
to
be
used
on
the
reservation,
there
--
the
state
statute
presently
would
permit
the
tribe
to
issue
what
is
termed
a
nontaxable
transaction
certificate
and
thereby
avoid
the
tax
if
purchased
in
alamogordo
in
this
case.
these
things
would
hinge
upon
whether
or
not
if
he
was
“on
the
reservation.”
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
it
is
physically
located
on
the
present
--
beyond
the
present
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
it
is
immediately
adjacent
to,
but
off
of
the
reservation.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
we
would
contend
that
the
interest
in
real
estate
upon
which
the
ski
run
is
located
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
it's
leased
from
the
forest
service
and
as
such,
is
an
interest
in
real
estate
and
is
effectively
subject
to
the
statute
which
provides
that
it's
not
subject
to
tax.
at
the
time
that
the
compensating
tax
was
assessed
against
the
tribe,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
improvements
have
been
completed
and
were
in
fact
permanently
attached
to
the
real
estate.
all
of
the
materials
against
which
the
compensating
tax
was
assessed
were
purchased
with
money
which
was
borrowed
from
the
united
states
government
and
all
of
such
purchases
were
approved
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
beginning,
as
of
the,
first
day
of
october
and
continuing
until
first
day
of
october
1963
and
continuing
until
the
end
of
december
of
1966,
mescalero
apache
tribe
has
paid
the
state
of
new
mexico
something
in
excess
of
$26,000.00
in
gross
receipts
taxes
by
reason
of
its
operation
of
the
ski
resort.
we
filed
a
claim
for
refund
that
--
a
protest
and
a
claim
for
refund
was
heard
by
the
commissioner
of
the
bureau
of
revenue,
we
were
turned
down.
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
state
exhausted
our
remedy.
we
are
presently
before
this
court
on
a
motion
of
certiorari.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
held
that
the
enabling
act
of
the
state
of
new
mexico,
principally
section
2
constituted
a
specific
grant
of
power
to
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
tax
as
other
lands
and
other
property
or
tax,
any
lands
and
other
property
outside
of
an
indian
any,
excuse
me,
outside
of
an
indian
reservations
owned
or
held
by
any
indian.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
enabling
act
of
the
state
of
new
mexico,
section
2,
while
the
quotation
is
correct,
it
simply
does
not
apply
to
an
indian
tribe.
any
indian
is
not
the
same
thing
as
an
indian
tribe
and
merely
reading
section
2
of
our
enabling
act
would
carry
this
forward
with
relative
strength.
the
first
section
of
section
2
refers
to
the
ordinary
disclaimer
and
refers
specifically
to
interest
in
real
estate
within
its
boundaries
held
by
any
indian
or
indian
tribe.
that
is
acquired
--
(inaudible)
had
been
acquired
through
the
united
states
and
with
the
mention
of
the
indian
tribe
in
the
same
section,
it
is
very
clear
that
it
was
inadvertently
left
out
of
the
section
that
is
cited
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
its
efforts
to
tax
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
under
these
particular
circumstances.
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
since
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
may
of
this
year
citing
mescalero
v.
jones
as
authority,
stated
that
these
cases
clearly
establish
that
indians
on
indian
lands
can
lawfully
be
subject
to
taxation
by
state
authorities
without
necessarily
interfering
with
any
right
of
self-government
or
impairment
of
any
rights
granted
or
reserved
to
them
by
the
federal
government,
makes
this
case
even
more
important
for
the
indians,
perhaps
not
only
in
new
mexico,
but
throughout
the
whole
of
the
united
states.
president
nixon
in
his
message
to
congress
in
july
of
1970
acknowledged
that
the
federal
government
must
support
and
encourage
indian
development.
he
recited
at
that
time
facts
such
as
unemployment
on
reservations
runs
as
high
as
80%.
that
80%
of
the
reservation
indians
are
below
the
poverty
level.
that
the
average
annual
income
is
$15,000.00
on
reservations
and
suggested
that
rather
than
oscillating
between
a
policy
of
termination
on
the
one
hand
and
paternalism
on
the
other,
that
the
federal
government
should
play
a
complimentary
role
with
the
indian
community
in
meeting
the
clear
needs
of
the
indians
in
the
united
states.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
sir
and
i
think
they
are
significant
from
the
point
of
view
that
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
is
presumed
by
case
law
to
speak
for
the
president
when
exercising
indian
--
a
policy
towards
indians
under
25
u.s.c.
2,
hopefully
that
policy
is,
as
expressed
by
the
president
sir.
now
interestingly
enough
in
the
case
of
mason
v.
u.s.
which
is
a
court
of
claims
case
decided
earlier
this
year,
judge
davis
recited
that
the
judicial
climate
had
changed
in
the
last
15
years
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
indian
tax
immunity
was
no
longer
directly
compared
to
and
correlated
with
other
governmental
immunities.
and
that
at
this
time,
the
courts
were
looking
to
the
particular
social
goals
that
congress
had
sought
to
reach
through
restrictions
on
indian
properties.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
instrumentality
doctrine
that
has
often
been
used
by
this
court
and
by
others
in
ruling
upon
taxability
of
indian
interests
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
profitability
which
in
federal
land
bank
versus
the
board
of
county
commissioners
decided
in
1961
was
determined
to
be
a
worthwhile
federal
purpose.
when
the
profitability
of
the
enterprise
is
considered
to
be
part
of
the
purpose
and
goal
that
any
tax
on
the
burden,
that
profitability
is
inappropriate
when
assessed
by
a
state,
absence
specific
authority
to
do
so.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
transactions
herein
taxed
by
the
state
of
new
mexico,
both
are
purchases
by
this
tribe
and
sales
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
and
that
are
clearly
with
commerce
with
the
indians.
the
treaty,
which
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
has,
subjected
the
tribe
to
all
of
the
regulations
and
laws
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
unlike
kake
v.
egan,
the
treaty
also
provided
that
the
tribe
was
lawfully
and
exclusively
under
the
laws
and
jurisdiction
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
i
believe
that
the
termination
policy
that
existed
at
one
time
as
expressed
by
congress
has
been
repudiated
by
the
various
sections
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
that
in
fact
section
25,
u.s.c.
476
under
which
this
tribe
is
organized
specifically
provides
that
in
addition
to
the
other
powers
vested
in
the
tribe
by
virtue
of
the
constitution,
there
shall
be
vested
the
right
to
prevent
the
sale
or
encumbrance
of
tribal
lands
or
other
tribal
assets
without
the
consent
of
the
tribe.
the
mescalero
constitution
carries
forward
this
language
giving
the
tribe
the
right
to
veto
such
encumbrances.
if
we
draw
a
parallel
to
the
situation
where
individual
indians
were
to
receive
their
patent
free
of
any
charge
or
encumbrance,
that
a
direct
parallel
exists
in
this
situation
without
even
any
congressional
intent
to
terminate
and
that
if
we
use
the
word
encumbrance
in
the
statute,
25
u.s.c.
476
and
the
mescalero
apache
constitution
in
the
same
light
that
this
court
in
that
past
has
used
the
phrase
charge
or
encumbrance
from
the
general
allotment
act
and
related
acts
that
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
this
land
also
should
not
be
taxed
by
the
state
of
new
mexico.
the
tribe
is
a
peculiar
entity.
it
is
created
by
congress
under
the
specific
statutes
we
have
cited.
it
is
supervised
in
all
matters
by
the
executive
department
acting
through
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
president
--
the
indian
policy
of
self
determination
without
determination,
necessarily
carries
with
it
the
intentional
withholding
of
direct
control.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
test
should
reasonably
include
the
absence
of
some
element
of
control
over
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
because
the
purpose
as
expressed
by
congress
in
the
executive
department
is
to
develop
independence
on
the
part
of
the
american
indian,
whether
or
not
termination
ultimately
takes
place
as
a
political
matter
that
should
be
decided
by
congress.
in
the
tribal
constitution
which
is
a
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
matter,
the
tribal
council’s
powers,
all
of
them
are
subject
to
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
article
11
under
which
this
tribe
exercised
its
purchase
of
these
assets,
the
plans
of
operation
and
--
as
adopted
are
subject
to
review
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
under
article
13
of
the
tribal
constitution
and
perhaps
most
important,
the
tribal
budget
is
subject
to
such
review
and
approval
as
the
secretary
requires
and
no
expenditures
maybe
made
except
in
conformity
with
that
budget.
control
of
the
budget
in
this
case
constitutes
essentially
absolute
control
over
the
activities
of
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
on
or
off
of
the
reservation
and
to
whatever
extent
the
secretary
of
the
interior
desires
to
exercise
such
control.
certainly,
the
tribe
is
more
closely
controlled
than
any
indian
trader
or
individual
indian
allottee
and
certainly
under
the
indian
reorganization
act,
the
revolving
loan
fund
and
other
statutes,
profitability
of
the
indian
venture
is
certainly
one
of
the
purposes
and
one
of
the
goals
that
is
foremost
in
the
minds
of
the
congress.
we
have
heard
a
good
deal
in
the
briefs
about
abusing
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
its
right
to
tax.
i
would
like
to
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
most
states
also
have
benefits
flowing
to
them
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
indians
were
there
before
and
are
still
there.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
that
is
really
beyond
the
scope
of
this
case.
i
do
not
want
to
intrude
upon
mcclanahan,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
to
income
earned
on
the
ski
run,
whole
new
avenue
opens.
if
the
income
were
earned
on
the
reservation,
the
contention
of
mcclanahan
would
be
that
it
was
not.
if
these
are
indian
lands,
the
statute
we
referred
to
is
465
which
provides
that
such
interest
in
real
estate
when
acquired
in
this
manner
are
not
subject
to
the
tax,
so
we
are
looking
to
the
statute.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
and
the
real
estate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
but
in
the
past
this
court
has
generally
held
that
when
you
do
not
permit
the
direct
tax,
you
do
not
permit
the
indirect
tax.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
i
think
it
should
be
treated
the
same
way
as
income
on
the
reservation
proper,
sir.
i
think
reservations
as
such
are
somewhat
archaic
and
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
reservation
in
this
case
if
this
court
were
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
executive
orders,
you
would
find
that
this
reservation
has
been
changed
many
times.
in
fact,
the
land
that
is
presently
the
subject
of
this
controversy
if
under
stipulated
fact
number
18
in
the
appendix,
we
stipulated
that
the
book,
the
mescalero
apache
was
proper
subject
for
judicial
notice.
if
you
were
so
inclined
on
page
211
and
212,
i
recited
the
facts
and
circumstances
under
which
this
land
was
removed
in
reservation
and
placed
in
the
public
domain
back
about
1882.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
i
think
in
regard
to
the
compensating
tax
where
it’s
directly
equivalent
to
interstate
commerce,
the
arguments
might
be
stronger
that
it
should
not
apply
in
regard
to
the
gross
receipts
tax,
it
maybe
--
the
argument
is
equally
is
strong.
i
fail
to
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
except
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
if
the
tribe
is
to
be
taxed,
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
court's
rulings
in
the
past
have
established
an
atmosphere
that
we
play
a
game
to
see
if
the
court
can
guess
some
way
that
has
not
been
prohibited
from
taxing
as
opposed
to
a
general
prohibition
against
tax
unless
specific
authority
is
given
by
congress.
certainly,
the
preferable
view
should
be
that
unless
authority
has
been
given
by
congress
to
the
state
to
tax,
especially
in
a
state
with
an
indian
tribe
where
exclusive
jurisdiction
has
been
granted
to
the
federal
government
and
not
to
the
state
government
by
the
original
treaty.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
income
from
exempt
lands?
no
sir
the
holding
was
that
the
income
from
reinvested
money
has
been
taxable
by
this
court.
the
income
from
the
exempt
lands
such
as
squire
versus
capoeman
for
example
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
i
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
well,
for
example
in
the
revenue
ruling
of
1967
provides
that
the
income
of
tribes
generally
is
not
subject
to
the
federal
income
tax
for
example.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
sir.
it
says
that
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
well,
they
are
excluded
from
it
because
they
are
not
of
the
nature
of
this
tax,
i
think
it's
the
basis
of
the
ruling.
they
are
not
a
“person”
under
that
statute.
and
as
such
they
are
acknowledged
to
be
something
other
--
something
unusual
and
i
think
all
indian
tribes
fall
in
that
category.
fundamentally,
i
believe
we
still
have
to
go
back
to
the
basic
treaty
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--
that
recites
--
that
it's
in
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government.
we
do
not
have
the
kake
argument
here.
i
do
not
think
kake
applies
to
this.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
sir,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
protections
are
already
built
in
to
the
system
which
controls
the
indian
tribe
is
very
appropriately
discussed
at
this
point.
first
of
all,
any
activity
of
the
tribe
in
so
doing
would
obviously
need
the
direct
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
if
it
had
--
if
it
had
the
authority
vested
in
it
from
the
secretary
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
given
its
approval,
tacitly
the
executive
department
having
approved
it,
if
congress
had
provided
they
way
with
all
they
have
done
here
with
a
loan,
i
would
suggest
that;
that
is
a
political
decision
that
generally
this
court
has
left
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
rather
than
exercising
itself
and
the
protection
should
be
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
if
the
purpose
of
the
loan
is
to
permit
the
economic
development
of
the
tribe
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
perhaps
be
an
abuse
if
you
are
going
beyond
the
reasonable
boundaries
that
for
example
this
court
might
establish.
but
in
the
first
instance
that
boundary
should
be
established
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
procedurally.
if
he
authorizes
a
tribe
to
spend
money
in
doing
that,
then
you
have
that
tax
approval.
if
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
congressional
authority
to
do
such
act.
as
i
said
this
seems
to
be
the
political
decision
and
effectively
when
do
you
limit
the
activities
of
an
indian
tribe?
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
last
three
minutes
for
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
by
contract
with
the,
i
believe
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
certain
welfare
items
are
--
services
are
provided.
the
school
system
in
which
the
indians
participate
is
supplemented
by
--
is
conducted
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
through
the
local
school
district.
however,
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
johnson
o’malley
funds
are
provided
to
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
assist
in
the
expense
of
educating
these
indian
children.
there
are
other
--
title
815
for
the
construction
of
school
buildings.
federal
impact
money
does
flow
to
the
state
in
exchange
for
providing
these
services
to
the
indians
who
in
fact
live
on
reservations.
if
i
have
any
time
left,
i
think
three
minutes,
i
reserve
it.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
the
assumption
that
the
tribe
is
acting
in
its
charter
capacity
here,
i
would
suggest
that
section
25
u.s.c.
482
which
authorizes
the
revolving
loan
funds
to
be
loaned
to
constitutional
entity
should
answer
that
question.
i
would
like
to
cite
to
the
court,
page
16
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
wherein
it
stated
that
early
cases
considered
both
the
tribe
and
their
lessees
exempt
from
state
taxation
of
indian
land
or
income
produced
from
such
lands,
citing
indian
oil
versus
oklahoma,
257
u.s.
501
and
further
that
the
immunity
from
taxation
of
lessees
of
the
government
was
over
ruled
in
helvering
versus
mountain
producers
corp.
303
u.s.,
but
the
immunity
of
the
government
itself
or
of
an
organized
indian
tribe
was
not
overruled.
i
would
like
to
respectfully
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
income
from
this
ski
run
--
ski
resort
goes
directly
to
the
tribe.
it
is
controlled
in
its
acquisition.
it
is
controlled
in
its
expenditure
far
more
than
anything
we've
said
here
today
indicates.
the
code
of
federal
regulation
controlling
the
budget
provisions
of
the
tribal
constitution
clearly
indicate
this.
these
controls
are
absolute.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
i
honestly
don't
know,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
(voice
overlap)
my
recollection
is
there
is
a
flat
rate.
well,
we
should
--
they
can
charge
anything
for
the
tickets
that
the
traffic
will
bear
in
a
sense,
but
even
the
prices
charged
are
subject
to
control
of
the
department
of
agriculture
under
36
cfr
251.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
i
don't
believe
it
is
collected.
i
believe
there
is
a
sort
of
even
dollar
ticket.
i
simply
do
not
know
but
i
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
sir.
i
simply
don’t
know
if
they
do
or
don't.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
treaty
refers
to
the
nationwide
nature
of
the
agreement
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
apaches
at
that
time,
kagama
carries
with
it
the
idea
that
the
indians,
they
are
not
geographically
limited
or
the
united
states
is
not
geographically
limited
in
regard
to
its
dealings
with
the
indians
and
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
absolute
control
over
this
indian
tribe
in
this
particular
operation
is
within
the
scope
and
meaning
of
the
statutes
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
should
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
economic
--
the
purpose
of
this
is
economic
development
of
the
indians
and
profitability
of
this
venture
is
significant
and
under
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
that
line.
therefore,
it
should
be
exempt
from
state
taxes
of
this
sort
or
generally
from
state
taxes.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
federal
income
taxes
are
covered
by
a
specific
regulation
with
a
case
citation
showed
to
--
i
forgot
what
it
is
right
now
sir,
and
the
tribal
income
is
not
taxable
to
the
tribe
when
--
i
believe
the
concept
being
that
when
it
passes
on,
if
it
was
taxable
to
the
tribe
and
goes
on
to
the
members
at
some
later
time
it
would
be
taxable
to
the
members.
but
if
that
doctrine
is
accepted
here
with
the
low
income
of
the
indians,
quite
obviously
you
can
pass
along
an
awful
lot
of
money
before
you
are
go
into
pay
any
taxes.
this
excise
tax
and
gross
receipts
tax
is
more
obvious
than
an
income
tax
would
be
because
it
goes
on
gross
income
regardless
of
profitability
and
that's
directly
contrary
to
the
policy
expressed
by
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
that
would
be
our
contention
under
revenue
ruling
67285,
i
think
it
is,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
to
this
court
is,
can
the
state
of
new
mexico
acting
under
state
law
impose
its
compensating
tax
upon
the
use
of
tangible
personal
property
owned
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
and
utilized
on
its
tribal
enterprise
principally
located
outside
of
the
boundaries
of
the
mescalero
reservation
and
can
the
state
of
new
mexico,
acting
under
state
law
validly
impose
its
gross
receipts
tax
under
the
same
circumstances.
the
essential
facts
of
the
case
are
that
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
is
a
treaty
tribe.
it's
present
reservation
boundaries
were
established
by
executive
order.
in
1936,
the
tribe
adopted
its
first
constitution
under
25
u.s.c.
476
which
constitution
was
amended
in
1965.
both
of
these
constitutions
were
duly
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
tribe
is
the
exclusive
owner
and
the
operator
of
sierra
blanca
ski
resort
which
is
located
in
otero
in
lincoln
county
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
the
ski
resort
is
primarily
on
the
lands
belonging
to
the
united
states
forest
service
and
leased
to
tribe
for
a
period
of
30
years.
the
ski
resort
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
not
entirely
so,
sir.
some
of
the
ski
runs
and
ski
trails
are
in
fact
on
the
reservation.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
i
think
we
can
draw
a
many
distinctions
for
that
purpose
and
i
wish
i
can
do
it
now.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
a
minor
one,
sir.
i
think
there
are
more
if
i
--
if
you
wish
me
to
pick
up
the
question
now,
i
will?
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
the
ski
resort
in
fact
is
bordered
on
the
south
by
the
reservation
itself
and
the
ski
enterprise
including
the
lease
with
the
united
states
forest
service
was
entered
into
by
the
tribe
pursuant
to
article
number
11
of
the
constitution
which
constitution
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
a
feasibility
study
was
prepared
and
paid
for
by
the
united
states
government
and
the
purpose
of
the
operation
of
the
ski
resort
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
is
to
raise
revenue
in
lieu
of
taxing
tribal
members
and
also
the
proceeds
are
used
for
the
educational
and
social
and
economic
welfare
of
the
mescalero
apache
people.
the
ski
resort
provides
job
training
for
the
members
of
the
tribe
and
there
are
20
to
30
members
of
the
tribe
who
are,
in
fact,
in
such
a
training
capacity.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
--
well,
yes
sir.
the
ski
run
is
operated
as
a
business
intending
to
train
members
of
the
tribe
to
operate
ski
lifts.
they
maybe
brought
in
the
economic
community
in
the
sense
of
training
for
leasing
ski
boots.
they
maybe
maintenance
personnel.
they
maybe
in
mescalero
conservation
area
grooming
the
ski
trails
and
maybe
slash
removal,
maybe
timbering.
each
of
these
jobs
is
in
a
training
capacity
for
the
individual
attempting
to
upgrade
the
individual
indians.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
the
ski
resort
is
run
under
a
plan
of
operation
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
tribal
council
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
it
is
run
under
that
plan
by
a
board
of
directors.
it
includes
indians
on
that
board.
mr.
chino
is
a
member
of
the
board
and
they
run
that
enterprise
subject
to
the
restrictions
set
forth
in
that
plan
of
operation.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
it
is
run
exclusively
by
indians
in
that
the
plan
of
operation
for
the
ski
run
was
adopted
by
the
tribal
council.
but
under
the
constitution
of
the
tribe,
even
that
plan
of
operation
after
adoption
by
the
tribal
council
is
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
there
are
non-indians
involved
in
the
operation,
yes
sir.
the
manager
for
example
is
not
an
indian
because
(voice
overlap)
qualified
indians
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
fundamentally,
sir.
some
of
them
actually
hold
down
jobs.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
this
case
is
here
on
stipulated
facts,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
this
controversy
arose,
that
was
in
fact
the
case.
since
that
time
circumstances
have
changed
so
that
there
are
employees
involved
who
have
been
longer
term
employees,
but
training
still
is
a
significant
part
of
the
operation
of
the
ski
run.
the
original
purchase
of
this
ski
run,
both
the
land
and
the
--
or
interest
in
the
land,
the
improvements
and
the
new
construction
on
the
ski
run
was
completely
financed
by
a
loan
to
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
under
25
u.s.c.,
section
470.
at
the
ski
resort,
united
states
government
must
approve
the
budget
for
the
fiscal
year,
the
leasing
of
equipment
and
other
property
used

the
bureau
of
revenue
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
conducted
an
audit
in
the
year
1968
and
as
a
result
assessed
compensating
tax
which
is
essentially
an
excise
tax
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$58,000.00
plus
penalty
and
interest.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
sir.
the
compensating
tax
in
new
mexico
applies
to
out
of
state
purchases
brought
into
the
state
and
in
fact
used
there.
in
that
sense
it
can
be
termed
a
used
tax.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
it’s
generally
referred
to
as
an
excise.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
if
the
purchase
was
made
by
the
tribe
for
tribal
purposes
we
would
contend
that
purchase
inside
or
outside
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
would
be
exempt
from
such
a
gross
receipts
or
compensating
tax.
in
this
case,
it
was
purchased
outside
the
state
or
it
would
not
be
under
the
compensating
tax.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
(voice
overlap)
would
say
the
same
thing
about
it.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
if
i
may,
the
new
statutes,
the
statutes
since
this
case
have
been
amended,
in
fact,
at
this
time
if
under
the
state
statute,
if
the
tangible
personal
property
were
to
be
used
on
the
reservation,
there
--
the
state
statute
presently
would
permit
the
tribe
to
issue
what
is
termed
a
nontaxable
transaction
certificate
and
thereby
avoid
the
tax
if
purchased
in
alamogordo
in
this
case.
these
things
would
hinge
upon
whether
or
not
if
he
was
“on
the
reservation.”
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
it
is
physically
located
on
the
present
--
beyond
the
present
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
it
is
immediately
adjacent
to,
but
off
of
the
reservation.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
we
would
contend
that
the
interest
in
real
estate
upon
which
the
ski
run
is
located
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
it's
leased
from
the
forest
service
and
as
such,
is
an
interest
in
real
estate
and
is
effectively
subject
to
the
statute
which
provides
that
it's
not
subject
to
tax.
at
the
time
that
the
compensating
tax
was
assessed
against
the
tribe,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
improvements
have
been
completed
and
were
in
fact
permanently
attached
to
the
real
estate.
all
of
the
materials
against
which
the
compensating
tax
was
assessed
were
purchased
with
money
which
was
borrowed
from
the
united
states
government
and
all
of
such
purchases
were
approved
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
beginning,
as
of
the,
first
day
of
october

of

mescalero
apache
tribe
has
paid
the
state
of
new
mexico
something
in
excess
of
$26,000.00
in
gross
receipts
taxes
by
reason
of
its
operation
of
the
ski
resort.
we
filed
a
claim
for
refund
that
--
a
protest
and
a
claim
for
refund
was
heard
by
the
commissioner
of
the
bureau
of
revenue,
we
were
turned
down.
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
state
exhausted
our
remedy.
we
are
presently
before
this
court
on
a
motion
of
certiorari.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
held
that
the
enabling
act
of
the
state
of
new
mexico,
principally
section
2
constituted
a
specific
grant
of
power
to
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
tax
as
other
lands
and
other
property
or
tax,
any
lands
and
other
property
outside
of
an
indian
any,
excuse
me,
outside
of
an
indian
reservations
owned
or
held
by
any
indian.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
enabling
act
of
the
state
of
new
mexico,
section
2,
while
the
quotation
is
correct,
it
simply
does
not
apply
to
an
indian
tribe.
any
indian
is
not
the
same
thing
as
an
indian
tribe
and
merely
reading
section
2
of
our
enabling
act
would
carry
this
forward
with
relative
strength.
the
first
section
of
section
2
refers
to
the
ordinary
disclaimer
and
refers
specifically
to
interest
in
real
estate
within
its
boundaries
held
by
any
indian
or
indian
tribe.
that
is
acquired
--
(inaudible)
had
been
acquired
through
the
united
states
and
with
the
mention
of
the
indian
tribe
in
the
same
section,
it
is
very
clear
that
it
was
inadvertently
left
out
of
the
section
that
is
cited
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
its
efforts
to
tax
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
under
these
particular
circumstances.
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
since
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
may
of
this
year
citing
mescalero
v.
jones
as
authority,
stated
that
these
cases
clearly
establish
that
indians
on
indian
lands
can
lawfully
be
subject
to
taxation
by
state
authorities
without
necessarily
interfering
with
any
right
of
self-government
or
impairment
of
any
rights
granted
or
reserved
to
them
by
the
federal
government,
makes
this
case
even
more
important
for
the
indians,
perhaps
not
only
in
new
mexico,
but
throughout
the
whole
of
the
united
states.
president
nixon
in
his
message
to
congress
in
july
of
1970
acknowledged
that
the
federal
government
must
support
and
encourage
indian
development.
he
recited
at
that
time
facts
such
as
unemployment
on
reservations
runs
as
high
as
80%.
that
80%
of
the
reservation
indians
are
below
the
poverty
level.
that
the
average
annual
income
is
$15,000.00
on
reservations
and
suggested
that
rather
than
oscillating
between
a
policy
of
termination
on
the
one
hand
and
paternalism
on
the
other,
that
the
federal
government
should
play
a
complimentary
role
with
the
indian
community
in
meeting
the
clear
needs
of
the
indians
in
the
united
states.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
sir
and
i
think
they
are
significant
from
the
point
of
view
that
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
is
presumed
by
case
law
to
speak
for
the
president
when
exercising
indian
--
a
policy
towards
indians
under
25
u.s.c.
2,
hopefully
that
policy
is,
as
expressed
by
the
president
sir.
now
interestingly
enough
in
the
case
of
mason
v.
u.s.
which
is
a
court
of
claims
case
decided
earlier
this
year,
judge
davis
recited
that
the
judicial
climate
had
changed
in
the
last
15
years
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
indian
tax
immunity
was
no
longer
directly
compared
to
and
correlated
with
other
governmental
immunities.
and
that
at
this
time,
the
courts
were
looking
to
the
particular
social
goals
that
congress
had
sought
to
reach
through
restrictions
on
indian
properties.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
instrumentality
doctrine
that
has
often
been
used
by
this
court
and
by
others
in
ruling
upon
taxability
of
indian
interests
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
profitability
which
in
federal
land
bank
versus
the
board
of
county
commissioners
decided
in
1961
was
determined
to
be
a
worthwhile
federal
purpose.
when
the
profitability
of
the
enterprise
is
considered
to
be
part
of
the
purpose
and
goal
that
any
tax
on
the
burden,
that
profitability
is
inappropriate
when
assessed
by
a
state,
absence
specific
authority
to
do
so.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
transactions
herein
taxed
by
the
state
of
new
mexico,
both
are
purchases
by
this
tribe
and
sales
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
and
that
are
clearly
with
commerce
with
the
indians.
the
treaty,
which
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
has,
subjected
the
tribe
to
all
of
the
regulations
and
laws
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
unlike
kake
v.
egan,
the
treaty
also
provided
that
the
tribe
was
lawfully
and
exclusively
under
the
laws
and
jurisdiction
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
i
believe
that
the
termination
policy
that
existed
at
one
time
as
expressed
by
congress
has
been
repudiated
by
the
various
sections
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
that
in
fact
section
25,
u.s.c.
476
under
which
this
tribe
is
organized
specifically
provides
that
in
addition
to
the
other
powers
vested
in
the
tribe
by
virtue
of
the
constitution,
there
shall
be
vested
the
right
to
prevent
the
sale
or
encumbrance
of
tribal
lands
or
other
tribal
assets
without
the
consent
of
the
tribe.
the
mescalero
constitution
carries
forward
this
language
giving
the
tribe
the
right
to
veto
such
encumbrances.
if
we
draw
a
parallel
to
the
situation
where
individual
indians
were
to
receive
their
patent
free
of
any
charge
or
encumbrance,
that
a
direct
parallel
exists
in
this
situation
without
even
any
congressional
intent
to
terminate
and
that
if
we
use
the
word
encumbrance
in
the
statute,
25
u.s.c.
476
and
the
mescalero
apache
constitution
in
the
same
light
that
this
court
in
that
past
has
used
the
phrase
charge
or
encumbrance
from
the
general
allotment
act
and
related
acts
that
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
this
land
also
should
not
be
taxed
by
the
state
of
new
mexico.
the
tribe
is
a
peculiar
entity.
it
is
created
by
congress
under
the
specific
statutes
we
have
cited.
it
is
supervised
in
all
matters
by
the
executive
department
acting
through
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
president
--
the
indian
policy
of
self
determination
without
determination,
necessarily
carries
with
it
the
intentional
withholding
of
direct
control.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
test
should
reasonably
include
the
absence
of
some
element
of
control
over
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
because
the
purpose
as
expressed
by
congress
in
the
executive
department
is
to
develop
independence
on
the
part
of
the
american
indian,
whether
or
not
termination
ultimately
takes
place
as
a
political
matter
that
should
be
decided
by
congress.
in
the
tribal
constitution
which
is
a
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
matter,
the
tribal
council’s
powers,
all
of
them
are
subject
to
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
article
11
under
which
this
tribe
exercised
its
purchase
of
these
assets,
the
plans
of
operation
and
--
as
adopted
are
subject
to
review
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
under
article
13
of
the
tribal
constitution
and
perhaps
most
important,
the
tribal
budget
is
subject
to
such
review
and
approval
as
the
secretary
requires
and
no
expenditures
maybe
made
except
in
conformity
with
that
budget.
control
of
the
budget
in
this
case
constitutes
essentially
absolute
control
over
the
activities
of
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
on
or
off
of
the
reservation
and
to
whatever
extent
the
secretary
of
the
interior
desires
to
exercise
such
control.
certainly,
the
tribe
is
more
closely
controlled
than
any
indian
trader
or
individual
indian
allottee
and
certainly
under
the
indian
reorganization
act,
the
revolving
loan
fund
and
other
statutes,
profitability
of
the
indian
venture
is
certainly
one
of
the
purposes
and
one
of
the
goals
that
is
foremost
in
the
minds
of
the
congress.
we
have
heard
a
good
deal
in
the
briefs
about
abusing
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
its
right
to
tax.
i
would
like
to
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
most
states
also
have
benefits
flowing
to
them
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
indians
were
there
before
and
are
still
there.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
that
is
really
beyond
the
scope
of
this
case.
i
do
not
want
to
intrude
upon
mcclanahan,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
to
income
earned
on
the
ski
run,
whole
new
avenue
opens.
if
the
income
were
earned
on
the
reservation,
the
contention
of
mcclanahan
would
be
that
it
was
not.
if
these
are
indian
lands,
the
statute
we
referred
to
is
465
which
provides
that
such
interest
in
real
estate
when
acquired
in
this
manner
are
not
subject
to
the
tax,
so
we
are
looking
to
the
statute.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
and
the
real
estate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
but
in
the
past
this
court
has
generally
held
that
when
you
do
not
permit
the
direct
tax,
you
do
not
permit
the
indirect
tax.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
i
think
it
should
be
treated
the
same
way
as
income
on
the
reservation
proper,
sir.
i
think
reservations
as
such
are
somewhat
archaic
and
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
reservation
in
this
case
if
this
court
were
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
executive
orders,
you
would
find
that
this
reservation
has
been
changed
many
times.
in
fact,
the
land
that
is
presently
the
subject
of
this
controversy
if
under
stipulated
fact
number
18
in
the
appendix,
we
stipulated
that
the
book,
the
mescalero
apache
was
proper
subject
for
judicial
notice.
if
you
were
so
inclined
on
page
211
and
212,
i
recited
the
facts
and
circumstances
under
which
this
land
was
removed
in
reservation
and
placed
in
the
public
domain
back
about
1882.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
i
think
in
regard
to
the
compensating
tax
where
it’s
directly
equivalent
to
interstate
commerce,
the
arguments
might
be
stronger
that
it
should
not
apply
in
regard
to
the
gross
receipts
tax,
it
maybe
--
the
argument
is
equally
is
strong.
i
fail
to
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
except
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
if
the
tribe
is
to
be
taxed,
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
court's
rulings
in
the
past
have
established
an
atmosphere
that
we
play
a
game
to
see
if
the
court
can
guess
some
way
that
has
not
been
prohibited
from
taxing
as
opposed
to
a
general
prohibition
against
tax
unless
specific
authority
is
given
by
congress.
certainly,
the
preferable
view
should
be
that
unless
authority
has
been
given
by
congress
to
the
state
to
tax,
especially
in
a
state
with
an
indian
tribe
where
exclusive
jurisdiction
has
been
granted
to
the
federal
government
and
not
to
the
state
government
by
the
original
treaty.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
income
from
exempt
lands?
no
sir
the
holding
was
that
the
income
from
reinvested
money
has
been
taxable
by
this
court.
the
income
from
the
exempt
lands
such
as
squire
versus
capoeman
for
example
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
i
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
well,
for
example
in
the
revenue
ruling
of
1967
provides
that
the
income
of
tribes
generally
is
not
subject
to
the
federal
income
tax
for
example.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
sir.
it
says
that
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
well,
they
are
excluded
from
it
because
they
are
not
of
the
nature
of
this
tax,
i
think
it's
the
basis
of
the
ruling.
they
are
not
a
“person”
under
that
statute.
and
as
such
they
are
acknowledged
to
be
something
other
--
something
unusual
and
i
think
all
indian
tribes
fall
in
that
category.
fundamentally,
i
believe
we
still
have
to
go
back
to
the
basic
treaty
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--
that
recites
--
that
it's
in
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government.
we
do
not
have
the
kake
argument
here.
i
do
not
think
kake
applies
to
this.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
sir,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
protections
are
already
built
in
to
the
system
which
controls
the
indian
tribe
is
very
appropriately
discussed
at
this
point.
first
of
all,
any
activity
of
the
tribe
in
so
doing
would
obviously
need
the
direct
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
if
it
had
--
if
it
had
the
authority
vested
in
it
from
the
secretary
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
given
its
approval,
tacitly
the
executive
department
having
approved
it,
if
congress
had
provided
they
way
with
all
they
have
done
here
with
a
loan,
i
would
suggest
that;
that
is
a
political
decision
that
generally
this
court
has
left
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
rather
than
exercising
itself
and
the
protection
should
be
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
if
the
purpose
of
the
loan
is
to
permit
the
economic
development
of
the
tribe
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
perhaps
be
an
abuse
if
you
are
going
beyond
the
reasonable
boundaries
that
for
example
this
court
might
establish.
but
in
the
first
instance
that
boundary
should
be
established
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
procedurally.
if
he
authorizes
a
tribe
to
spend
money
in
doing
that,
then
you
have
that
tax
approval.
if
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
congressional
authority
to
do
such
act.
as
i
said
this
seems
to
be
the
political
decision
and
effectively
when
do
you
limit
the
activities
of
an
indian
tribe?
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
last
three
minutes
for
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
by
contract
with
the,
i
believe
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
certain
welfare
items
are
--
services
are
provided.
the
school
system
in
which
the
indians
participate
is
supplemented
by
--
is
conducted
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
through
the
local
school
district.
however,
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
johnson
o’malley
funds
are
provided
to
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
assist
in
the
expense
of
educating
these
indian
children.
there
are
other
--
title
815
for
the
construction
of
school
buildings.
federal
impact
money
does
flow
to
the
state
in
exchange
for
providing
these
services
to
the
indians
who
in
fact
live
on
reservations.
if
i
have
any
time
left,
i
think
three
minutes,
i
reserve
it.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
the
assumption
that
the
tribe
is
acting
in
its
charter
capacity
here,
i
would
suggest
that
section
25
u.s.c.
482
which
authorizes
the
revolving
loan
funds
to
be
loaned
to
constitutional
entity
should
answer
that
question.
i
would
like
to
cite
to
the
court,
page
16
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
wherein
it
stated
that
early
cases
considered
both
the
tribe
and
their
lessees
exempt
from
state
taxation
of
indian
land
or
income
produced
from
such
lands,
citing
indian
oil
versus
oklahoma,
257
u.s.
501
and
further
that
the
immunity
from
taxation
of
lessees
of
the
government
was
over
ruled
in
helvering
versus
mountain
producers
corp.
303
u.s.,
but
the
immunity
of
the
government
itself
or
of
an
organized
indian
tribe
was
not
overruled.
i
would
like
to
respectfully
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
income
from
this
ski
run
--
ski
resort
goes
directly
to
the
tribe.
it
is
controlled
in
its
acquisition.
it
is
controlled
in
its
expenditure
far
more
than
anything
we've
said
here
today
indicates.
the
code
of
federal
regulation
controlling
the
budget
provisions
of
the
tribal
constitution
clearly
indicate
this.
these
controls
are
absolute.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
i
honestly
don't
know,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
(voice
overlap)
my
recollection
is
there
is
a
flat
rate.
well,
we
should
--
they
can
charge
anything
for
the
tickets
that
the
traffic
will
bear
in
a
sense,
but
even
the
prices
charged
are
subject
to
control
of
the
department
of
agriculture
under
36
cfr
251.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
i
don't
believe
it
is
collected.
i
believe
there
is
a
sort
of
even
dollar
ticket.
i
simply
do
not
know
but
i
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes
sir.
i
simply
don’t
know
if
they
do
or
don't.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
treaty
refers
to
the
nationwide
nature
of
the
agreement
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
apaches
at
that
time,
kagama
carries
with
it
the
idea
that
the
indians,
they
are
not
geographically
limited
or
the
united
states
is
not
geographically
limited
in
regard
to
its
dealings
with
the
indians
and
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
absolute
control
over
this
indian
tribe
in
this
particular
operation
is
within
the
scope
and
meaning
of
the
statutes
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
should
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
economic
--
the
purpose
of
this
is
economic
development
of
the
indians
and
profitability
of
this
venture
is
significant
and
under
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
that
line.
therefore,
it
should
be
exempt
from
state
taxes
of
this
sort
or
generally
from
state
taxes.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
federal
income
taxes
are
covered
by
a
specific
regulation
with
a
case
citation
showed
to
--
i
forgot
what
it
is
right
now
sir,
and
the
tribal
income
is
not
taxable
to
the
tribe
when
--
i
believe
the
concept
being
that
when
it
passes
on,
if
it
was
taxable
to
the
tribe
and
goes
on
to
the
members
at
some
later
time
it
would
be
taxable
to
the
members.
but
if
that
doctrine
is
accepted
here
with
the
low
income
of
the
indians,
quite
obviously
you
can
pass
along
an
awful
lot
of
money
before
you
are
go
into
pay
any
taxes.
this
excise
tax
and
gross
receipts
tax
is
more
obvious
than
an
income
tax
would
be
because
it
goes
on
gross
income
regardless
of
profitability
and
that's
directly
contrary
to
the
policy
expressed
by
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
that
would
be
our
contention
under
revenue
ruling
67285,
i
think
it
is,
sir.
