justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
you
tell
us
what
kind
of
training
is
given
to
them?
are
there
other
people
who
work
there
without
training?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
who
runs
the
ski
resort?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
i
understand
from
what
you
just
said
that
it
is
not
run
exclusively
by
indians?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is,
are
there
non-indians
operating
in
the
ski
resort?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
the
indians
that
are
present
there
are
only
in
training?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
what
i
get
from
your
briefs
that
the
indians
there
are
only
in
training
and
that
other
people
that
are
running
it,
is
this
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
talking
about
section
465.
do
you
see
any
difference
between
the
possibility
of
applying
the
exemption
in
that
section
to
the
used
tax
on
the
one
hand
or
applying
it
to
the
privileged
tax
in
new
mexico
and
the
other?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
see
no
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
take
that
the
solicitor
general
does
and
his
approach
does
see
a
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
fettinger,
let
me
ask

question

of
services?
