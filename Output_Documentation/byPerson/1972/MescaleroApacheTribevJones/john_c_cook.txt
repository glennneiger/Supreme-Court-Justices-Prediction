mr.
john
c.
cook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
considers
this
case
to
present
two
questions.
can
the
state
of
new
mexico
impose
its
compensating
tax
on
the
use
of
tangible
personal
property
which
is
owned
by
an
indian
tribe
and
which
is
used
by
that
tribe
outside
the
boundaries
of
the
tribe's
reservation.
the
second
question
presented
is
whether
the
state
of
new
mexico
can
impose
its
gross
receipts
tax
upon
the
receipts
of
an
indian
tribe
from
an
operation
of
a
ski
resort
exclusively
owned
by
the
tribe
and
located
almost
entirely
outside
the
boundaries
of
the
tribe's
reservation.
the
taxes
at
issue
here
are
not
taxes
on
real
or
tangible
personal
property.
the
gross
receipts
tax
is
a
privilege
tax
and
the
compensating
tax
is
an
excise
tax.
these
taxes
are
measured
by
the
value
of
the
property.
the
property
being
the
tribe's
gross
receipts
from
its
off
reservation
business
activity
and
the
value
of
the
materials
which
the
tribe
acquired
outside
new
mexico
and
used
to
construct
two
off
reservation
ski
lifts.
the
incidents
of
the
taxes
at
issue
here
are
not
on
real
property
or
tangible
personal
property.
the
compensating
tax
on
the
use
of
property
is
not
a
tax
on
a
property
itself.
i
think
that
principle
was
established
in
united
states
versus
city
of
detroit.
the
incidents
of
the
gross
receipts
tax
at
issue
here
is
not
on
real
property
or
tangible
personal
property,
but
rather
it
is
on
the
tribe's
sale
of
services
at
the
ski
resort.
although,
the
gross
receipts
tax
is
imposed
on
the
seller
tribe,
it
is
ordinarily
passed
onto
buyers.
the
enabling
act
for
new
mexico
provides
in
part
that
nothing
herein
shall
preclude
the
state
from
taxing
as
other
lands
and
other
property
are
taxed,
any
lands,
or
other
property
outside
an
indian
reservation
owned
or
held
by
any
indian.
this
language
indicates
an
intention
or
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
to
allow
the
state
to
tax
activities
such
as
those
engaged
in
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
has
argued
that
the
use
of
the
phrase
by
any
indian
in
the
exclusionary
language
of
the
new
mexico
enabling
act
indicates
that
this
language
should
be
restricted
so
as
not
to
include
an
indian
tribe
such
as
petitioner.
respondents
contend
that
if
the
language
of
the
second
subparagraph
of
section
2
of
the
enabling
act
is
read
as
a
whole,
the
implication
is
clear
that
the
phrase
“by
any
indian”
refers
to
an
indian
tribe
as
well
as
individual
indians
or
groups
of
indians.
however,
even
if
the
argument
of
the
united
states
and
the
petitioner
is
accepted,
the
jurisdiction
taken
by
the
united
states
over
the
indian
tribes
under
the
new
mexico
enabling
act,
does
not
extend
to
the
off
reservation
activities
of
the
petitioner
mescalero
apache
tribe.

mr.

it's

is

mr.

i
don’t
--
i
don’t
know
your
honor
whether
they
could
have
or
not,
they
did
not.
mr.
john
c.

well,
i
don’t
know
why
they
could
not
have,
but
i
know
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
they
did
not.
mr.
john
c.
cook
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
i
am
not
agreeing
that
we
would
not
have
a
case,
if
this
ski
resort
was
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
we
say
that
what's
being
taxed
here
is
not
--
mr.
john
c.
cook
well,
we
said
that
that
issue
isn't
before
the
court
in
our
case.
mr.
john
c.
cook
i
am
not
speaking
for
the
state
of
new
mexico,
but
i
would
say
if
the
enterprise
was
located
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
the
tax
could
still
apply,
but
that
issue
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
furthermore,
the
united
states
congress
has
not
immunized
or
exempted
the
tribe
from
the
taxes
at
issue
here
by
reason
of
25
united
states
code,
sections
465.
the
last
paragraph
of
section
465
states
in
part,
“title
to
any
lands
or
rights
acquired
pursuant
to,
and
then
its
cites
certain
reference
sections,
shall
be
taken
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
indian
tribe
or
individual
indians
for
which
the
land
is
acquired
and
such
lands
or
rights
shall
be
exempt
from
state
and
local
taxation.”
this
section
does
not
have
any
application
to
this
case
for
two
reasons.
first,
lands
or
rights
in
lands
are
not
being
taxed.
second,
the
united
states
forest
service
lands
which
were
leased
to
petitioner
tribe
were
not
acquired
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
the
lands
belonged
to
united
states
and
were
then
leased
to
the
tribe.
the
lands
were
not
acquired
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
indian
tribe
as
is
required
for
the
exemption
under
25
united
states
code,
section
465.
the
congressional
debate
on
section
465
indicated
that
the
purpose
of
the
section
was
to
allow
for
consolidation
of
badly
checker
boarded
reservations
and
supplementation
of
indian
stock
and
grazing
in
forest
lands.
25
united
states
code
section
470
established
a
$20
million
revolving
fund
and
authorized
loans
to
indian
chartered
corporations
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
economic
development
of
tribes
and
members
of
tribes.
the
clear
implication
from
the
stipulated
facts
in
this
case
is
that
petitioner
tribe
was
organized
as
an
indian
chartered
corporation.
the
tribe
acquired
a
loan
under
25
united
states
code
section
470
and
loans
under
that
section
were
to
be
made
to
indian
chartered
corporations.
the
respondents
contend
it
is
therefore
clear
that
the
petitioner
tribe
was
organized
as
an
indian
chartered
corporation.
the
intent
of
congress
in
separating
its
appropriations
for
land
acquisitions
and
its
appropriations
for
loans
is
clear.
tribal
organization
and
the
consolidation
of
reservations

federal
policy
of
preserving
indian
customs
in
management
of
their
affairs.
corporate
organization
and
the
loan
fund
for
the
federal
policy
of
integrating
the
indians
into
american
economic
life.
if
the
purpose
of
the
federal
policy
with
regard
to
the
loan
fund
was
to
integrate
the
indians
into
the
american
economic
life,
entry
into
that
economic
life
should
be
and
was
intended
to
be
on
the
footing
of
equal
competition.
the
new
mexico
bureau
of
revenue
recognizes
that
if
the
imposition
of
taxes
at
issue
here
interferes
with
the
tribe's
right
to
reservation
and
self
government,
the
tax
must
fail.
we
think
this
test
is
clear
from
the
cases
of
williams
versus
lee
and
organized
village
of
kake
versus
egan.
there
are
no
facts
present
in
the
instant
case
to
show
that
there
was
any
interference
with
the
mescalero
apache
tribe's
right
to
reservation
and
self-government.
due
to
the
absence
of
such
facts,
there
is
no
showing
that
there
is
any
real
current
or
even
future
danger
that
the
tribe's
right
to
reservation
and
self-government
would
be
interfered
with
by
the
imposition
of
the
taxes
at
issue
here.
many
businesses
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
thrive
and
still
pay
the
taxes
at
issue
here.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
ski
resort
operation
of
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
would
suffer
any
adverse
economic
consequences
as
a
result
of
the
taxes
imposed
here.
even
if
this
were
the
case,
such
an
adverse
economic
effect
does
not
without
more
indicate
an
interference
with
the
tribe’s
right
to
reservation
and
self-government.
the
operation
of
a
ski
resort
is
not
a
governmental
function,
we
contend.
it
is
clearly
a
propriety
function.
the
two
functions
are
separate
and
distinct.
if
there
was
any
interference,
it
would
be
with
be
only
with
the
proprietary
function
of
the
tribe.
lastly,
the
bureau
of
revenue
contends
that
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
is
not
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
argument
say
the
tribe
is
a
federal
instrumentality,
same
to
be
premised
on
the
assumption
that
a
tribe
is
acting
as
a
virtual
ward
of
the
united
states
government
in
engaging
in
its
off
reservation
business
activities.
if
a
tribe
is
a
virtual
ward
of
the
united
states
government
then
where
the
tribal
sovereignty
and
self-government
which
the
petitioner
argues
are
being
interfered
with?
the
mescalero
bureau
of
revenue
contends
that
petitioner
cannot
be
and
is
not
both
a
sovereign
and
a
federal
instrumentality.
petitioner
simply
is
not
a
federal
instrumentality.
if
the
tribe
was
operating
as
an
indian
chartered
corporation,
that
corporation
was
not
only
for
the
convenience
of
the
united
states,
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
mescalero
apache
tribe.
the
corporation
was
not
organized
solely
to
carry
out
governmental
objectives
of
the
united
states.
the
objectives
of
the
tribe
and
the
tribe
acting
as
a
corporation
in
the
operation
of
the
ski
resort
were
to
benefit
the
mescalero
apache
people.
a
ski
resort
certainly
is
not
essential
to
the
performance
of
governmental
functions.
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
government
of
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
will
continue
to
function
regardless
of
the
existence
of
the
tribe's
ski
resort.
this
ski
resort
cannot
be
regarded
as
virtually
an
arm
of
the
government.
therefore,
under
the
test
set
forth
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
agricultural
national
bank
versus
tax
commission
and
in
department
of
employment
versus
united
states,
the
tribe
is
not
a
federal
instrumentality.
that
concludes
my
argument.
mr.
john
c.
cook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
considers
this
case
to
present
two
questions.
can
the
state
of
new
mexico
impose
its
compensating
tax
on
the
use
of
tangible
personal
property
which
is
owned
by
an
indian
tribe
and
which
is
used
by
that
tribe
outside
the
boundaries
of
the
tribe's
reservation.
the
second
question
presented
is
whether
the
state
of
new
mexico
can
impose
its
gross
receipts
tax
upon
the
receipts
of
an
indian
tribe
from
an
operation
of
a
ski
resort
exclusively
owned
by
the
tribe
and
located
almost
entirely
outside
the
boundaries
of
the
tribe's
reservation.
the
taxes
at
issue
here
are
not
taxes
on
real
or
tangible
personal
property.
the
gross
receipts
tax
is
a
privilege
tax
and
the
compensating
tax
is
an
excise
tax.
these
taxes
are
measured
by
the
value
of
the
property.
the
property
being
the
tribe's
gross
receipts
from
its
off
reservation
business
activity
and
the
value
of
the
materials
which
the
tribe
acquired
outside
new
mexico
and
used
to
construct
two
off
reservation
ski
lifts.
the
incidents
of
the
taxes
at
issue
here
are
not
on
real
property
or
tangible
personal
property.
the
compensating
tax
on
the
use
of
property
is
not
a
tax
on
a
property
itself.
i
think
that
principle
was
established
in
united
states
versus
city
of
detroit.
the
incidents
of
the
gross
receipts
tax
at
issue
here
is
not
on
real
property
or
tangible
personal
property,
but
rather
it
is
on
the
tribe's
sale
of
services
at
the
ski
resort.
although,
the
gross
receipts
tax
is
imposed
on
the
seller
tribe,
it
is
ordinarily
passed
onto
buyers.
the
enabling
act
for
new
mexico
provides
in
part
that
nothing
herein
shall
preclude
the
state
from
taxing
as
other
lands
and
other
property
are
taxed,
any
lands,
or
other
property
outside
an
indian
reservation
owned
or
held
by
any
indian.
this
language
indicates
an
intention
or
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
to
allow
the
state
to
tax
activities
such
as
those
engaged
in
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
in
the
brief
for
the
united

as
amicus

has
argued
that
the
use
of
the
phrase

the

enabling
act
indicates
that
this
language
should
be
restricted
so
as
not
to
include
an
indian
tribe
such
as
petitioner.
respondents
contend
that
if
the
language
of
the
second
subparagraph
of
section
2
of
the
enabling
act
is
read
as
a
whole,
the
implication
is
clear
that
the
phrase
“by
any
indian”
refers
to
an
indian
tribe
as
well
as
individual
indians
or
groups
of
indians.
however,
even
if
the
argument
of
the
united
states
and
the
petitioner
is
accepted,
the
jurisdiction
taken
by
the
united
states
over
the
indian
tribes
under
the
new
mexico
enabling
act,
does
not
extend
to
the
off
reservation
activities
of
the
petitioner
mescalero

know

they

that
would

mr.

we
said
that
that
issue
isn't
before

in
our
case.
mr.

i
am
not
speaking
for
the
state
of
new
mexico,
but
i
would
say
if
the
enterprise
was
located
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
the
tax
could
still
apply,
but
that
issue
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
furthermore,
the
united
states
congress
has
not
immunized
or
exempted
the
tribe
from
the
taxes
at
issue
here
by
reason
of
25
united
states
code,
sections
465.
the
last
paragraph
of
section
465
states
in
part,
“title
to
any
lands
or
rights
acquired
pursuant
to,
and
then
its
cites
certain
reference
sections,
shall
be
taken
in
the
name
of
the
united

in
trust
for
the
indian

or
individual
indians
for
which
the
land
is
acquired
and
such
lands
or
rights
shall
be
exempt
from
state
and
local
taxation.”
this
section
does
not
have
any
application
to
this
case
for
two
reasons.
first,
lands
or
rights
in
lands
are
not
being
taxed.
second,
the
united
states
forest
service
lands
which
were
leased
to
petitioner
tribe
were
not
acquired
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
the
lands
belonged
to
united
states
and
were
then
leased
to
the
tribe.
the
lands
were
not
acquired
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
indian
tribe
as
is
required
for
the
exemption
under
25
united
states
code,
section
465.
the
congressional
debate
on
section
465
indicated
that
the
purpose
of
the
section
was
to
allow
for
consolidation
of
badly
checker
boarded
reservations
and
supplementation
of
indian
stock
and
grazing
in
forest
lands.
25
united
states
code
section
470
established
a
$20
million
revolving
fund
and
authorized
loans
to
indian
chartered
corporations
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
economic
development
of
tribes
and
members
of
tribes.
the
clear
implication
from
the
stipulated
facts
in
this
case
is
that
petitioner
tribe
was
organized
as
an
indian
chartered
corporation.
the
tribe
acquired
a
loan
under
25
united
states
code
section
470
and
loans
under
that
section
were
to
be
made
to
indian
chartered
corporations.
the
respondents
contend
it
is
therefore
clear
that
the

the
new

bureau
of
revenue
recognizes
that
if
the
imposition
of
taxes
at
issue
here
interferes
with
the
tribe's
right
to
reservation
and
self
government,
the
tax
must
fail.
we
think
this
test
is
clear
from
the
cases
of
williams
versus
lee
and
organized
village
of
kake
versus
egan.
there
are
no
facts
present
in
the
instant
case
to
show
that
there
was
any
interference
with
the
mescalero
apache
tribe's
right
to
reservation
and
self-government.
due
to
the
absence
of
such
facts,
there
is
no
showing
that
there
is
any
real
current
or
even
future
danger
that
the
tribe's
right
to
reservation
and
self-government
would
be
interfered
with
by
the
imposition
of
the
taxes
at
issue
here.
many
businesses
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
thrive
and
still
pay
the
taxes
at

here.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
ski
resort
operation
of
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
would
suffer
any
adverse
economic
consequences
as
a
result
of
the
taxes
imposed
here.
even
if
this
were
the
case,
such
an
adverse
economic
effect
does
not
without
more
indicate
an
interference
with
the
tribe’s
right
to
reservation
and
self-government.
the
operation
of
a
ski
resort
is
not
a
governmental
function,
we
contend.
it
is
clearly
a
propriety
function.
the
two
functions
are
separate
and
distinct.
if
there
was
any
interference,
it
would
be
with
be
only
with
the
proprietary
function
of
the
tribe.
lastly,
the
bureau
of
revenue
contends
that
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
is
not
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
argument
say
the
tribe
is
a
federal
instrumentality,
same
to
be
premised
on
the
assumption
that
a
tribe
is
acting
as
a
virtual
ward
of
the
united
states
government
in
engaging
in
its
off
reservation
business
activities.
if
a
tribe
is
a
virtual
ward
of
the
united
states
government
then
where
the
tribal
sovereignty
and
self-government
which
the
petitioner
argues
are
being
interfered
with?
the
mescalero
bureau
of
revenue
contends
that
petitioner
cannot
be
and
is
not
both
a
sovereign
and
a
federal
instrumentality.
petitioner
simply
is
not
a
federal
instrumentality.
if
the
tribe
was
operating
as
an
indian
chartered
corporation,
that
corporation
was
not
only
for
the
convenience
of
the
united
states,
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
mescalero
apache
tribe.
the
corporation
was
not
organized
solely
to
carry
out
governmental
objectives
of
the
united
states.
the
objectives
of
the
tribe
and
the
tribe
acting
as
a
corporation
in
the
operation
of
the
ski
resort
were
to
benefit
the
mescalero
apache
people.
a
ski
resort
certainly
is
not
essential
to
the
performance
of
governmental
functions.
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
government
of
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
will
continue
to
function
regardless
of
the
existence
of
the
tribe's
ski
resort.
this
ski
resort
cannot
be
regarded
as
virtually
an
arm
of
the
government.
therefore,
under
the
test
set
forth
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
agricultural
national
bank
versus
tax
commission
and
in
department
of
employment
versus
united
states,
the
tribe
is
not
a
federal
instrumentality.
that
concludes
my
argument.
