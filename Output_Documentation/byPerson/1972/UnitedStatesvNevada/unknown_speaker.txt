unknown
speaker
i

somewhere
in
these
papers,
the
variety
of
cutthroat
trout
and
then
another
fish
i
have
never

of.
unknown
speaker

that
again?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
a
variety
of
trout?
unknown
speaker
are
cui-ui
found
anywhere
else?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
member
of
the
trout
family
or
is
that
something?
unknown
speaker
does
a
cui-ui
have
the
bloodstream
too?
unknown
speaker
reproduce
in
the
way--
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
has
the
lowering
of
the
level
of
the
water
in
the
lake
resulted
solely
from
the
diversion
to
the
other
river?
unknown
speaker
but
i
understand
that
mr.
solicitor
general
that,
that
kind
is
now
been
arrested
as
it,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
seen
these
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
newlands
project
is
the
one
in
the
carson
river
setup,
isn't
it?
i
don't
see
the
name
newlands
on
here.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
trying
to
identify
it
on
the
map
here.
unknown
speaker
no,
we
don't.
unknown
speaker
it's
upside
down.
how's
that?
yes,
yes.
does
newlands
drain
into
the
colorado?
unknown
speaker
was
that
on
the
still
water
point?
unknown
speaker
is
the
water
in
the
sump
saline?
unknown
speaker
is
the
water
in
the
sump
salt
water
or
fresh
water?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
the
still
water.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
know
about
the
end
product
of
the
sump.
is
that
salt
water?
unknown
speaker
has
the
complaint
or
other
materials
before
us
indicate
the
extent
of
the
fishing
rights
that
the
indians
are
claiming?
is
it
just
broadly
to
maintain
the
lake
and
the
fish
as
they
were
when
the
reservation
was
created?
unknown
speaker
well
is
the
--
is
the
fishing
right
one
for
a
sustenance
or
is
it
at
commercial?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
commercial
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
do
they
sell
the
fish
here,
do
they
sell
the
fish
to
other
fish
hatcheries
or
they
sell
it
as
food
or
what?
unknown
speaker
there
are
no
treaty
fishing
rights
that
are
kind
of
planned
here
at
all,
and
i
understand
that
you
are
relying
upon
the
implied
reservation
of
water
for
the
reservation
alone.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
allow
these
cases
where
we
--
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
they
weren't
given
any
fishing
rights.
this
was
a
reservation
originally
in
1859
confirmed
by
president
grant
in
1870s
and
you
are
relying
on
the
arizona
doctrine
where
they
have
implied
reservation
of
water.
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
tell
us
that
historically,
these
people
live
by
fishing.
that
was
their
economy
but
there
is
no
fishing
rights.
unknown
speaker
when
did
that
establish,
mr.
solicitor
general,
when
was
the
newlands
project
begun?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
possibility
for
parallel
suits
in
federal
courts
in
california
and
nevada
and
then
we
having
them
shown
into
the
multi-district
panel.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
more
like
with
tidelands.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
what
we
have
here
is
that
this
is
an
argument
on
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint
as
i
understand
it,
and
they
haven't
even
been
responsive
--
