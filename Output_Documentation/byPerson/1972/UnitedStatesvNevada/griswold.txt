mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
motion
by
the
united
states
or
leave
to
file
an
original
complaints
against
the
states
of
nevada
and
california.
united
states
appears
primarily
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
on
behalf
of
the
pyramid
lake
indians
of
the
paiute
tribe.
united
states
does
allege
the
ownership
of
certain
lands
and
water
rights
and
its
own
right
but
it
would
not
be
here
if
that
was
its
only
claim.
the
basic
claim
relates
to
the
pyramid
lake
indian
reservation
in
nevada.
the
general
location
is
indicated
by
the
map
which
we
have
included
in
the
pocket
at
the
back
of
our
complaint
and
brief
and
this
is
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
mr.
griswold
the
map
will
show
that
pyramid
lake
is
in
the
upper
center,
it
is
fed
by
the
truckee
river
which
rises
in
lake
tahoe.
lake
tahoe
is
partly
in
california
and
partly
in
nevada.
the
river
runs
for
20
miles
in
california
where
it
obtains
most
of
its
water
and
then
it
flows
for
65
miles
in
nevada
until
it
empties
into
pyramid
lake.
mr.
griswold
pyramid
lake
is
fed
by
the
truckee
river
which
has
its
outlet
--
which
is
the
outlet
of
lake
tahoe.
lake
tahoe
is
located
partly
in
california
and
partly
in
nevada.
the
river
runs
for
20
miles
in
california
where
it
gets
most
of
its
water
and
then
it
flows
for
65
miles
in
nevada
until
it
empties
into
pyramid
lake.
the
court
will
note
on
the
map
just
above
the
center,
the
derby
diversion
dam
and
then
the
truckee
canal,
which
diverts
a
substantial
part
of
the
water
of
the
truckee
river
into
the
carson
river
system
and
the
carson
river
system
with
the
water
from
the
truckee
river
produces
the
newlands
irrigation
district
which
is
the
green
area
in
the
right
part
of
the
map.
the
way
the
map
appears,
one
could
get
the
impression
that
the
carson
river
is
also
an
outlet
of
lake
tahoe,
but
that
is
wrong;
the
carson
river
rises
in
the
mountains
to
the
east
of
lake
tahoe
and
the
water
from
lake
tahoe
gets
to
the
newlands
irrigation
district
through
the
truckee
canal
from
the
truckee
river
and
thereby
represents
water
which
does
not
flow
on
to
pyramid
lake.
pyramid
lake
is
30
miles
north
of
reno.
it's
a
remarkable
lake.
some
say
it's
the
finest
desert
lake
in
the
country.
the
pyramid
lake
indian
reservation
originated
on
november
29,
1859
and
was
confirmed
by
president
grant
by
an
executive
order
issued
on
march
23,
1874.
the
pyramid
lake
indians
had
a
culture
which
was
based
primarily
on
fish
on
which
they
lived,
and
which
they
used
for
bargain.
and
the
lake
provided
a
large
and
remarkable
fishery
and
the
purpose
of
including
the
lake
in
the
reservation
was
to
maintain
the
source
of
the
indians'
livelihood.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
i
heard
of
it
in
connection
with
this
case,
it's
spelled
cui-ui
and
is
pronounced
cui-ui.
mr.
griswold
cui-ui
and
it's
pronounced
cui-ui.
mr.
griswold
that
is
a
fish
which
is
peculiar
to
the
pyramid
lake,
the
lahontan
cutthroat
trout
was
a
very
large
and
successful
commercially
and
otherwise
fish
which
was
peculiar
to
pyramid
lake.
pyramid
lake
is
the
geological
residue
of
an
older
lake
called
lahontan
and
indeed
the
reservoir
created
in
the
carson
river
is
now
called
the
lahontan
lake.
and
the
fish
in
pyramid
lake
and
that's
part
of
the
complaint
here,
the
cutthroat
trout
in
pyramid
lake
have
been
unable
to
maintain
themselves
because
with
the
fall
and
the
level
of
the
lake,
the
fish
are
unable
to
get
up
the
truckee
river
to
spawn.
now
the
fish
have
been
taken
out
and
put
into
fish
hatcheries
and
are
now
planted
in
pyramid
lake
and
they
are
also
found
in
some
of
the
other
lakes,
but
without
the
help
of
men,
the
lahontan
cutthroat
trout
would
be
extinct
now.
it
is
it
and
the
cui-ui
are
both
on
the
list
of
endangered
species
of
the
appropriate
body
of
the
government.
mr.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
not
any
place
else,
no
place
else.
and
as
i
say,
it's
been
taken
out
for
planning
but
--
mr.
griswold
i
am
not
enough
of
biologist
to
say
that,
i
believe
so
but
i
do
not
know
except
that
i
think
that
it
has
a
--
i
think
it
would
go
back
to
millions
of
years
before
you
had
planned
a
--
mr.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
they
do
not.
the
cui-ui
can
apparently
--
mr.
griswold
i
am
told
that
they
are
stringent
family,
the
cui-ui
is.
in
1903,
after
the
passage
of
the
reclamation
act
in
1902,
the
newlands
reclamation
project
was
established
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
named
after
a
senator
from
nevada.
in
1905,
the
derby
dam
was
completed
with
the
consequent
diversion
of
much
of
the
water
from
the
truckee
river
to
the
carson
river
system.
as
a
result
of
this
and
other
activities,
the
water
flowing
down
the
truckee
river
to
pyramid
lake
has
been
reduced
to
about
250,000
acre
feet
while
375,000
to
400,000
acre
feet
are
required
to
replace
evaporation
losses
and
maintain
the
level
of
the
lake.
because
of
this
annual
deficit
of
125,000
to
150,000
acre
feet,
the
level
of
the
lake
dropped
more
than
80
feet
since
1906.
mr.
griswold
i
am
not
sure
that
the
complaint
does,
a
material
referred
to
in
the
complaint,
particularly
the
pyramid
lake
task
force
report
of
which
copies
have
been
distributed
to
the
court,
give
figures
going
back
to
the
1860s
as
to
the
flow
into
pyramid
lake.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
level
of
the
lake
probably
would
have
fluctuated
because
of
variations
in
annual
rainfall
which
the
natural
runoffs
of
the
river
varies
apparently
from
200,000
to
a
million,
100,000.
it
averages
enough
to
maintain
the
level
of
the
lake
at
the
level
where
it
was
in
1860.
apparently,
there
has
been
a
constant
slight
diminution
in
the
lake,
but
this
has
become
very
marked
since
the
diversion
of
the
water
by
the
derby
dam
and
the
newlands
--
mr.
griswold
it
has
been
arrested,
but
it
has
not
been
--
necessarily,
we
can't
foresee
the
future
that
it
would
be
stopped
because
of
various
actions
which
have
occurred,
part
of
which
is
a
substantial
rainfall
in
recent
years
but
others
a
suit
brought
by
the
indians
if
i
may
say
so
and
their
desperation
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
compel
a
secretary
to
follow
his
own
regulations
and
to
avoid
and
prevent
wastage
of
water.
there
has
been
a
considerable
entries
in
the
amount
of
water
and
it
is
true
that
in
the
past
six
years,
the
level
of
the
lake
has
risen
by
about
ten
feet
so
that
the
net
fall
of
the
lake
at
this
point
is
about
70
feet.
there
is
a
picture
of
the
truckee
river
falling
into
the
lake
in
the
task
forest
report
on
page
17
which
has
been
distributed
to
the
court
or
at
least
made
available
to
the
court
in
another
copy.
mr.
griswold
well,
i
am
now
told
only
one
copy
was
filed
with
the
clerk.
i
thought
one
had
been
made
for
each
member
of
the
court.
i
would
suggest
you
look
at
page
17,
you
will
find
a
picture
of
the
truckee
river
entering
in
what
amounts
to
a
big
delta
into
the
lake,
the
drop
was
70
feet
makes
it
impossible
for
the
fish
to
get
up
to
the
river
and
spawn.
this
has
destroyed
the
fisheries,
threatens
extinction
of
the
trout
native
to
the
lake.
it
increases
the
salinity
of
the
land,
causes
land
erosion
and
threatens
continued
existence
of
the
lake
as
a
useful
body
of
water.
on
behalf
of
the
indians,
through
this
suit,
the
united
states
contends
that
when
the
pyramid
lake
reservation
was
established
in
1859,
the
united
states,
by
implication,
reserve
for
the
benefit
of
the
pyramid
lake
indians
sufficient
water
from
the
truckee
river
for
maintenance
and
preservation
of
pyramid
lake,
and
for
the
maintenance
of
the
lower
reaches
of
the
truckee
river
as
a
natural
spawning
ground
for
fish.
united
states
claims
these
rights
for
the
pyramid
lake
indians
with
a
priority
date
of
november
29,
1859.
whether
this
claim
is
warranted,
whether
the
indians
have
these
rights
is
the
principle
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case.
now
the
court
also
--
the
complaint
also
contains
reference
to
a
suit
which
the
united
states
brought
in
connection
with
the
newlands
project.
mr.
griswold
perhaps
it
is
not,
but
that
is
what
it
is
known
by
and
it
is
so
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
mr.
griswold
that
whole
project,
you
have
one
with
color?
mr.
griswold
well,
i
am
sorry.
that
whole
project
in
the
right
half,
right
third
of
the
map
is
the
newlands
project.
it
obtains
water
from
the
carson
river
as
to
which
there
also
is
a
suit
in
the
nevada
courts,
one
which
over
a
period
of
30-40
years
operates
on
the
basis
of
a
temporary
injunction.
that's
all
that
has
ever
been
issued.
the
diversion
of
the
water
from
the
truckee
river
to
the
newlands
project
--
mr.
griswold
oh
no,
mr.
justice,
newlands
drains
into
what
they
call
a
sink
out
there
and
disappears.
in
fact,
the
sink
has
greatly
augmented
because
of
the
undo
diversion
from
the
truckee
river.
the
runoff
water
from
the
newlands
project
goes
into
the
sink
and
that
has
made
a
new
wild
life
refuge
where
there
are
ducks
and
where
hunters
go,
we
would
say,
using
the
indians
water
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
a
new
sporting
and
non-commercial
activity.
mr.
griswold
that
is
on
the
map
beyond
still
water
point
and
finally,
when
it
gets
to
still
water
wildlife
management
area
in
nearly
upper
right-hand
corner
and
the
swale
which
is
at
the
right
edge
of
the
map.
now,
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
water
there.
that
water
will
presumably
be
cut
down
and
allowed
to
go
down
the
truckee
river
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
district
columbia
court
in
the
case
requiring
the
secretary
to
conduct
a
more
careful
and
efficient
operation
of
the
(inaudible)
river
project.
mr.
griswold
the
water?
mr.
griswold
in
pyramid
lake?
mr.
griswold
that
is
essentially
fresh,
mr.
justice.
i
suppose
that
the
water
that
goes
into
the
wildlife
refuge,
is
essentially
fresh.
i
suppose
that
having
percolated
through
the
land,
it
has
picked
up
some
salts.
but
the
water
that
goes
down
the
truckee
river
is
particularly
fresh,
is
remarkably
fresh.
mr.
griswold
as
i
understand,
it
is
essentially
fresh
water
and
it
finally
percolates
into
the
ground
and
disappears.
pyramid
lake
is
more
saline
than
freshwater
lakes
we
are
used
to
in
this
part
of
the
country,
but
it
is
remarkably
non-saline
when
it
has
an
adequate
water
supply.
mr.
griswold
well,
it
isn't
even
quite
that
far,
mr.
justice.
we
don't
ask
for
enough
water
to
restore
the
level
of
the
lake
to
what
it
was
in
1859.
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
is
on
page
14,
prays
that
a
decree
to
be
entered
declaring
the
rights
of
the
united
states
for
the
benefit
of
the
pyramid
lake
paiute
tribe
of
indians
to
the
use
of
sufficient
waters
of
the
truckee
river
to
fulfill
the
purpose
for
which
the
pyramid
lake
reservation
was
created
including
the
maintenance
and
preservation
of
pyramid
lake
and
the
maintenance
of
the
lower
reaches
of
the
truckee
river
as
a
natural
spawning
ground
for
fish.
incidentally,
i
am
told
that
--
mr.
griswold
for
both,
for
both,
mr.
justice.
that
was
the
way
they
used
it
at
the
--
mr.
griswold
the
commercial
end
would
be
that
the
indians
would
sell
large
quantities
of
a
very
remarkable
fish
for
which
they
would
get
money,
with
which
they
would
buy
clothes
and
other
kinds
of
food.
mr.
griswold
they
have
historically,
mr.
justice.
there
have
been
substantial
fishery
establishments
there
including
the
canning
of
the
fish.
this
is
all
greatly
restricted.
we
are
told
that
by
council
for
the
states
that
there
are
only
400
indians
who
live
their
now,
but
there
are
500
who
don't
live
there
and
have
an
effect
been
driven
away
because
the
economic
possibilities
of
maintaining
themselves
have
gone
with
the
disappearance
of
the
fishery.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
the
indians
own
the
lake,
so
that
they
would
--
mr.
griswold
they
would
have
their
fishing
rights
if
there
were
adequate
fishes.
mr.
griswold
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
griswold
that
is
exactly
our
position.
i
would
suppose
that
the
only
question
here
apparently
arises
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
ohio
against
the
wyandotte
chemical
company
and
more
recently,
in
illinois
against
milwaukee
and
it
will
be
my
purpose
to
try
to
show
that
the
approach
taken
in
those
cases
is
not
applicable
here
and
thus,
motion
for
leave
to
file
the
complaint
should
be
granted.
this
case
does
not
raise
questions
of
state
or
local
law
as
was
the
situation
in
wyandotte.
the
questions
here
are
federal
questions
of
the
sort
which
this
court
has
traditionally
considered
in
original
suit.
the
united
states
appears
as
a
trustee
for
an
indian
tribe,
exercising
one
of
its
greatest
responsibilities
under
the
constitution.
the
questions
involved
are
federal
questions,
essentially
the
effect
of
the
establishment
of
an
indian
reservation
by
federal
authority
and
the
application
to
that
reservation
of
the
rule
of
the
case
of
winters
against
the
united
states
and
the
very
closely
comparable
case
of
arizona
against
california
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
where
the
united
states
intervened
in
an
original
suit
on
behalf
of
indian
tribes
and
this
court
made
essentially
the
same
sort
of
adjudication
that
we
are
seeking
here.
the
order
in
arizona
against
california
provides
that
a
million
in
acre
feet
of
water
shall
be
made
available
to
the
indians
at
the
suit
of
the
united
states
and
there
is
also
involved
the
effect
if
any,
on
the
rights
of
the
indians
from
the
establishment
of
the
newlands
irrigation
project
under
the
reclamation
act.
a
claim
made
by
the
--
mr.
griswold
newlands
project
was
authorized
in
1903,
there
was
a
suit
called
the
orr
water
ditch
suit
filed
in
1913
in
which
a
final
decree
was
entered
in
1944
and
one
of
the
questions
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
effect
of
that
on
the
residence
of
the
indians.
we
contend
that
it
does
not
bar
the
rights
of
the
indians
but
that's
one
of
the
issues
which
would
be
heard
if
they
leave
to
file,
the
complaint
was
granted.
the
claim
made
by
the
united
states
relates
to
the
waters
of
an
interstate
stream
and
thus,
presents
the
kind
of
question
appropriate
for
decision
by
this
court.
and
moreover
and
most
important,
this
court
is
the
only
tribunal
which
can
make
a
definitive
and
final
adjudication
of
the
right
claimed
on
behalf
of
the
indians
and
nevada
suggests
in
this
brief
that
the
suit
could
proceed
in
the
district
court
for
nevada,
despite
the
fact
that
most
of
the
water
comes
from
california
and
an
adjudication
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
the
indians
made
by
the
nevada
court
would
not
be
binding
on
california
or
on
california
citizens.
nevada
says
that
the
nevada
district
court
could
reach
california
and
its
citizens
through
some
sort
of
a
long-arm
approach.
perhaps
congress
could
authorize
this
and
for
a
period
of
four
years,
from
1922
to
1926,
congress
did
authorize
amount
to
interstate
suits
in
the
district
courts
with
respect
to
water
and
other
matters
and
some
of
the
cases
cited
here
began
in
that
period,
notably
the
brooks
case
which
was
a
contempt
case
for
violating
a
decree
which
was
involved
arizona
and
new
mexico
in
a
suit
brought
during
the
period
when
the
arizona
court
was
given
jurisdiction
over
parties
in
new
mexico.
congress
could
authorize
it
but
it
hasn't
done
so
and
i
know
of
no
basis
for
such
jurisdiction
in
a
case
like
this.
incidentally,
in
the
careful
and
thoughtful
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
california
here,
there
is
no
such
suggestion;
california
does
not
come
forward
and
say
it
wants
to
appear
in
nevada
district
court.
mr.
griswold
i
know
of
no
way
the
multi-district
deals
with
cases
where
the
court
has
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
issue.
here
the
nevada
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
california
water
rights.
the
california
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
nevada
water
rights
and
i
know
of
no
authority
under
the
multi-district
suit
to
require
them
to
get
together
and
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
on
the
questions
of
fact
or
of
law.
this
court
maybe
concerned
if
it
takes
jurisdiction
of
the
case
that
it
will
be
involved
in
a
multitude
of
factual
determinations
with
respect
to
individual
water
rights.
perhaps
there
are
thousands
of
persons
both
in
nevada
and
then
california,
i
think
that
concern
is
unwanted.
the
basic
question
here
is
an
important
one
and
it
may
present
some
legal
difficulties
but
the
problem
is
one
which
the
court
is
well-equipped
to
resolve.
the
question
raised
here
is
whether
the
united
states
has
any
right
on
behalf
of
the
pyramid
lake
indians,
and
if
so,
what
is
the
extent
of
that
right.
if
it
is
established
that
the
pyramid
lake
indians
are
entitled
to
a
definite
amount
of
water
with
a
fixed
temporal
priority
then
it
will
be
known
hot
water
remains
for
use
in
california
and
in
nevada.
at
that
point,
it
may
well
be
that
the
two
states
can
agree
on
their
relative
portions
of
the
remaining
water
as
they
have
agreed
in
a
compact
which
is
pending
before
congress
but
not
approved
by
congress
but
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
indians
have
no
rights.
the
compact
does
say
that
it
doesn't
deprive
anybody
of
any
rights
but
it
doesn't
recognize
that
there
are
any
such
right.
the
united
states
has
no
interest
whatever
in
how
the
allocation
to
california
and
nevada
is
divided
among
their
individual
water
users
and
the
district
court
in
nevada
can
make
the
appropriate
allocations
among
nevada
users
if
that
question
too
is
not
settled
by
agreement.
now
i
have
mentioned
the
compact
and
i
don't
have
time
to
discuss
it.
it
obviously
is
of
no
legal
significance
because
it
has
not
been
approved
by
congress.
incidentally,
both
senators
from
california
have
joined
in
a
statement
and
i
mention
this
because
it
indicates
the
unlikelihood
that
congress
is
going
to
prove
the
contract
if
both
senators
from
california
oppose
it.
they
have
joined
in
a
statement
in
which
they
conclude,
we
therefore
support
the
efforts
of
the
tribe
and
federal
government
to
obtain
a
judicial
determination
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
griswold
eventually,
it
might
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
basic
question
of
whether
the
indians
have
any
right
and
if
so
to
its
extent,
it
would
be
helpful
to
have
it
heard
before
master
but
it
would
be
a
relatively
simple
matter
before
a
master
and
not
the
question
of
allocating
water
rights
among
all
the
people
in
a
great
--
mr.
griswold
it
would
be
very
much
like
the
tidelands
although
perhaps
somewhat
simpler
that
that;
not
involving
the
massive
historical
considerations
that
were
there.
mr.
griswold
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference.
what
we
are
--
i
think
what
we
are
trying
to
say
in
that
is
that
it
ought
to
be
adjudicated
here
on
the
basic
issue,
do
the
indians
have
a
right
or
not.
before
there
is
any
consideration
given
to
the
problem,
how
you
allocate
the
remaining
water.
now
whether
--
mr.
griswold
there
haven't
been
answers
and
i
should
think
that
after
the
answers
have
been
filed
and
we
know
what
is
denied
and
what
needs
to
be
proved,
it
would
be
possible
at
that
point
to
it
could
well
be
that
the
answers
will
be
filed
in
such
form
as
to
raise
only
a
legal
question
at
least
at
the
threshold.
and
that
threshold
question,
do
the
indians
have
a
right
or
don't
they,
can
be
presented
as
a
purely
legal
question.
it
becomes
a
little
more
complicated
when
you
say,
yes
they
have
a
right
but
what
is
its
extent.
for
example,
the
indians
do
not
claim
that
they
are
entitled
375,000
acre
feet
every
year.
sometimes
the
water
goes
down,
i
think
their
position
would
be
that
they
are
entitled
to
an
average
of
375,000
acre
feet
over
a
period
of,
let's
say,
ten
years.
so
that
if
it
goes
down
one
year,
some
water
can
be
made
available
to
the
newlands
project
and
it
can
be
made
up
in
subsequent
years.
it's
undoubtedly
true
that
there
have
been
differences
of
opinion
and
conflicts
of
interest
within
the
interior
department
about
this
claim
of
the
pyramid
lake
indians.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
do
not
always
see
eye-to-eye.
it's
equally
true
that
the
department
of
justice
has
not
advanced
this
claim
in
prior
proceedings.
the
indians
should
not
be
bound
about
that.
there
will
be
argument
about
res
judicata
and
merger
and
bar
and
our
position
is
that
the
indian
should
not
be
bound
to
their
great
loss
by
reason
of
defaults
which
may
have
occurred
on
the
part
of
officers
of
the
united
states
in
the
past
and
i
don't
criticize
them
because
they
were
reflecting
a
national
attitude
at
that
time.
it
was
a
great
step
when
the
secretary
of
the
interior
requested
the
department
of
justice
to
start
this
case
in
this
court.
it
would
be
something
of
a
tragedy
for
the
indians
if
this
court
should
now
refuse
to
consider
the
claim
made
on
their
behalf.
mr.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
the
suit
pending
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
general
to
decide
whether
an
appeal
should
be
taken
and
the
decision
has
been
made
that
no
appeal
will
be
taken.
nevertheless,
that
case
involves
only
the
left-over,
only
the
run
off,
only
the
water
which
does
not
go
to
someone
else
by
right.
it
leaves
–
it
does
undertake
to
maximize
the
left-over
and
it
will
help
the
indians
but
it
gives
them
no
right.
that
water
can
be
appropriated
by
somebody
else,
it
remain
surplus
water
in
the
river.
it
can
be
appropriated
in
california,
it
can
be
appropriated
in
nevada.
the
only
way
that
the
indians
can
be
protected
is
by
having
an
adjudication
that
they
have
a
right
under
the
winters
doctrine
as
applied
by
this
court
most
recently
in
arizona
against
california.
i
am
also
advised
that
the
office
of
management
and
budget
has
authorized
the
filing
with
congress
of
a
statement
that
the
federal
government
opposes
the
ratification
of
the
compact
until
this
question
is
resolved.
i
would
point
out
too
that
in
the
compact
itself,
in
article
18
(c),
it
is
provided
that
the
compact
does
not
deal
with
the
rights
of
any
parties
which
are
not
specified
in
the
compact
and
that
was
intended
to
leave
open
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
there
was
an
adjudication
of
the
rights
of
the
indians.
mr.
griswold
under
the
case
in
colorado
the
--
mr.
griswold
--
that
would
be
true.
that
was
an
intrastate
stream
in
that
case.
there
is
no
way
--
mr.
griswold
with
respect
to
the
competing
claims
in
newlands
these
are
intrastate
claims
but
with
respect
to
the
claims
in
california
and
i
would
point
out
that
they
are
substantial,
we
have
filed
a
supplemental
reply
brief
here
which
recounts
the
or
sets
out
the
text
of
an
order
of
the
state
water
rights
board
in
california
which
granted
a
substantial
additional
amount
out
of
lake
tahoe
saying
that
in
that
decision
the
board
assumed
to
be
surplus
and
unappropriated.
the
water
from
lake
tahoe
and
the
truckee
river
flowing
by
derby
dam
which
is
not
required
to
satisfy
decreed
downstream
indian
rights
and
which
wastes
in
the
pyramid
lake.
the
only
decreed
rights
the
indians
have
is
30,000
feet
for
irrigation.
we
are
seeking
hereto
establish
decreed
rights
in
support,
in
favor
of
the
indians
to
maintain
the
level
of
pyramid
lake.
mr.
griswold
i
think
that
is
entirely
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
griswold
all
this
court
needs
to
do
here
is
to
determine
whether
the
indians
have
a
right
with
a
priority
--
mr.
griswold
all
this
court
needs
to
do
here
mr.
justice
is
to
determine
whether
the
indians
have
a
right
with
a
certain
priority.
mr.
griswold
no
mr.
justice.
all
that
they
need
to
do
is
to
determine
whether
the
indians
have
a
right
with
a
certain
priority
and
to
allocate
the
waters
of
the
stream
between
california
and
nevada
who
appear
as
parens
patriae
and
who
will
represent
the
water
users
in
those
states
just
as
they
did
in
arizona
against
california
or
exactly
this
was
done
--
mr.
griswold
the
suit
was
instituted
by
the
states
but
the
intervention
by
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
indians
was
against
this
--
the
suit
was
instituted
by
the
states
but
the
intervention
by
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
indians
was
by
the
united
states
and
against
the
states
and
this
court
adjudicated
the
rights
and
adjudicated
that
the
indians
were
entitled
to
a
million
acre
feet
in
that
case.
if
the
court
here
adjudicates
that
the
indians
are
entitled
to
a
right
with
a
certain
priority
and
allocates
that
between
the
two
states
which
is
what
it
did
in
arizona
against
california,
then
the
question
of
allocating
the
water
to
the
individual
users
which
is
allocated
to
nevada
in
the
one
case
can
be
handled
in
the
nevada
court
and
if
allocation
to
california
users
can
be
handled
in
the
california
court
--
mr.
griswold
they
are
represented
by
their
respective
states
as
has
been
the
case
in,
i
think
i
am
safe
to
saying
dozens
of
cases
involving
interstate
water
rights
before
this
court,
where
the
states
appears
parens
patriae.
mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
motion
by
the
united
states
or
leave
to
file
an
original
complaints
against
the
states
of
nevada
and
california.
united
states
appears
primarily
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
on
behalf
of
the
pyramid
lake
indians
of
the
paiute
tribe.
united
states
does
allege
the
ownership
of
certain
lands
and
water
rights
and
its
own
right
but
it
would
not
be
here
if
that
was
its
only
claim.
the
basic
claim
relates
to
the
pyramid
lake
indian
reservation
in
nevada.
the
general
location
is
indicated
by
the
map
which
we
have
included
in
the
pocket
at
the
back
of
our
complaint
and
brief
and
this
is
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
mr.
griswold
the
map
will
show
that
pyramid
lake
is
in
the
upper
center,
it
is
fed
by
the
truckee
river
which
rises
in
lake
tahoe.
lake
tahoe
is
partly
in
california
and
partly
in
nevada.
the
river
runs
for
20
miles
in
california
where
it
obtains
most
of
its
water
and
then
it
flows
for
65
miles
in
nevada
until
it
empties
into
pyramid
lake.
mr.
griswold
pyramid
lake
is
fed
by
the
truckee
river
which
has
its
outlet
--
which
is
the
outlet
of
lake
tahoe.
lake
tahoe
is
located
partly
in
california
and
partly
in
nevada.
the
river
runs
for
20
miles
in
california
where
it
gets
most
of
its
water
and
then
it
flows
for
65
miles
in
nevada
until
it
empties
into
pyramid
lake.
the
court
will
note
on
the
map
just
above
the
center,
the
derby
diversion
dam
and
then
the
truckee
canal,
which
diverts
a
substantial
part
of
the
water
of
the
truckee
river
into
the
carson
river
system
and
the
carson
river
system
with
the
water
from
the
truckee
river
produces
the
newlands
irrigation
district
which
is
the
green
area
in
the
right
part
of
the
map.
the
way
the
map
appears,
one
could
get
the
impression
that
the
carson
river
is
also
an
outlet
of
lake
tahoe,
but
that
is
wrong;
the
carson
river
rises
in
the
mountains
to
the
east
of
lake
tahoe
and
the
water
from
lake
tahoe
gets
to
the
newlands
irrigation
district
through
the
truckee
canal
from
the
truckee
river
and
thereby
represents
water
which
does
not
flow
on
to
pyramid
lake.
pyramid
lake
is
30
miles
north
of
reno.
it's
a
remarkable
lake.
some
say
it's
the
finest
desert
lake
in
the
country.
the
pyramid
lake
indian
reservation
originated
on
november
29,
1859
and
was
confirmed
by
president
grant
by
an
executive
order
issued
on
march
23,
1874.
the
pyramid
lake
indians
had
a
culture
which
was
based
primarily
on
fish
on
which
they
lived,
and
which
they
used
for
bargain.
and
the
lake
provided
a
large
and
remarkable
fishery
and
the
purpose
of
including
the
lake
in
the
reservation
was
to
maintain
the
source
of
the
indians'
livelihood.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
i
heard
of
it
in
connection
with
this
case,
it's
spelled
cui-ui
and
is
pronounced
cui-ui.
mr.
griswold
cui-ui
and
it's
pronounced
cui-ui.
mr.
griswold
that
is
a
fish
which
is
peculiar
to
the
pyramid
lake,
the
lahontan
cutthroat
trout
was
a
very
large
and
successful
commercially
and
otherwise
fish
which
was
peculiar
to
pyramid
lake.
pyramid
lake
is
the
geological
residue
of
an
older
lake
called
lahontan
and
indeed
the
reservoir
created
in
the
carson
river
is
now
called
the
lahontan
lake.
and
the
fish
in
pyramid
lake
and
that's
part
of
the
complaint
here,
the
cutthroat
trout
in
pyramid
lake
have
been
unable
to
maintain
themselves
because
with
the
fall
and
the
level
of
the
lake,
the
fish
are
unable
to
get
up
the
truckee
river
to
spawn.
now
the
fish
have
been
taken
out
and
put
into
fish
hatcheries
and
are
now
planted
in
pyramid
lake
and
they
are
also
found
in
some
of
the
other
lakes,
but
without
the
help
of
men,
the
lahontan
cutthroat
trout
would
be
extinct
now.
it
is
it
and
the
cui-ui
are
both
on
the
list
of
endangered
species
of
the
appropriate
body
of
the
government.
mr.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
not
any
place
else,
no
place
else.
and
as
i
say,
it's
been
taken
out
for
planning
but
--
mr.
griswold
i
am
not
enough
of
biologist
to
say
that,
i
believe
so
but
i
do
not
know
except
that
i
think
that
it
has
a
--
i
think
it
would
go
back
to
millions
of
years
before
you
had
planned
a
--
mr.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
they
do
not.
the
cui-ui
can
apparently
--
mr.
griswold
i
am
told
that
they
are
stringent
family,
the
cui-ui
is.
in
1903,
after
the
passage
of
the
reclamation
act
in
1902,
the
newlands
reclamation
project
was
established
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
named
after
a
senator
from
nevada.
in
1905,
the
derby
dam
was
completed
with
the
consequent
diversion
of
much
of
the
water
from
the
truckee
river
to
the
carson
river
system.
as
a
result
of
this
and
other
activities,
the
water
flowing
down
the
truckee
river
to
pyramid
lake
has
been
reduced
to
about
250,000
acre
feet
while
375,000
to
400,000
acre
feet
are
required
to
replace
evaporation
losses
and
maintain
the
level
of
the
lake.
because
of
this
annual
deficit
of
125,000
to
150,000
acre
feet,
the
level
of
the
lake
dropped
more
than
80
feet
since
1906.
mr.
griswold
i
am
not
sure
that
the
complaint
does,
a
material
referred
to
in
the
complaint,
particularly
the
pyramid
lake
task
force
report
of
which
copies
have
been
distributed
to
the
court,
give
figures
going
back
to
the
1860s
as
to
the
flow
into
pyramid
lake.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
level
of
the
lake
probably
would
have
fluctuated
because
of
variations
in
annual
rainfall
which
the
natural
runoffs
of
the
river
varies
apparently
from
200,000
to
a
million,
100,000.
it
averages
enough
to
maintain
the
level
of
the
lake
at
the
level
where
it
was
in
1860.
apparently,
there
has
been
a
constant
slight
diminution
in
the
lake,
but
this
has
become
very
marked
since
the
diversion
of
the
water
by
the
derby
dam
and
the
newlands
--
mr.
griswold
it
has
been
arrested,
but
it
has
not
been
--
necessarily,
we
can't
foresee
the
future
that
it
would
be
stopped
because
of
various
actions
which
have
occurred,
part
of
which
is
a
substantial
rainfall
in
recent
years
but
others
a
suit
brought
by
the
indians
if
i
may
say
so
and
their
desperation
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
compel
a
secretary
to
follow
his
own
regulations
and
to
avoid
and
prevent
wastage
of
water.
there
has
been
a
considerable
entries
in
the
amount
of
water
and
it
is
true
that
in
the
past
six
years,
the
level
of
the
lake
has
risen
by
about
ten
feet
so
that
the
net
fall
of
the
lake
at
this
point
is
about
70
feet.
there
is
a
picture
of
the
truckee
river
falling
into
the
lake
in
the
task
forest
report
on
page
17
which
has
been
distributed
to
the
court
or
at
least
made
available
to
the
court
in
another
copy.
mr.
griswold
well,
i
am
now
told
only
one
copy
was
filed
with
the
clerk.
i
thought
one
had
been
made
for
each
member
of
the
court.
i
would
suggest
you
look
at
page
17,
you
will
find
a
picture
of
the
truckee
river
entering
in
what
amounts
to
a
big
delta
into
the
lake,
the
drop
was
70
feet
makes
it
impossible
for
the
fish
to
get
up
to
the
river
and
spawn.
this
has
destroyed
the
fisheries,
threatens
extinction
of
the
trout
native
to
the
lake.
it
increases
the
salinity
of
the
land,
causes
land
erosion
and
threatens
continued
existence
of
the
lake
as
a
useful
body
of
water.
on
behalf
of
the
indians,
through
this
suit,
the
united
states
contends
that
when
the
pyramid
lake
reservation
was
established
in
1859,
the
united
states,
by
implication,
reserve
for
the
benefit
of
the
pyramid
lake
indians
sufficient
water
from
the
truckee
river
for
maintenance
and
preservation
of
pyramid
lake,
and
for
the
maintenance
of
the
lower
reaches
of
the
truckee
river
as
a
natural
spawning
ground
for
fish.
united
states
claims
these
rights
for
the
pyramid
lake
indians
with
a
priority
date
of
november
29,
1859.
whether
this
claim
is
warranted,
whether
the
indians
have
these
rights
is
the
principle
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case.
now
the
court
also
--
the
complaint
also
contains
reference
to
a
suit
which
the
united
states
brought
in
connection
with
the
newlands
project.
mr.
griswold
perhaps
it
is
not,
but
that
is
what
it
is
known
by
and
it
is
so
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
mr.
griswold
that
whole
project,
you
have
one
with
color?
mr.
griswold
well,
i
am
sorry.
that
whole
project
in
the
right
half,
right
third
of
the
map
is
the
newlands
project.
it
obtains
water
from
the
carson
river
as
to
which
there
also
is
a
suit
in
the
nevada
courts,
one
which
over
a
period
of
30-40
years
operates
on
the
basis
of
a
temporary
injunction.
that's
all
that
has
ever
been
issued.
the
diversion
of
the
water
from
the
truckee
river
to
the
newlands
project
--
mr.
griswold
oh
no,
mr.
justice,
newlands
drains
into
what
they
call
a
sink
out
there
and
disappears.
in
fact,
the
sink
has
greatly
augmented
because
of
the
undo
diversion
from
the
truckee
river.
the
runoff
water
from
the
newlands
project
goes
into
the
sink
and
that
has
made
a
new
wild
life
refuge
where
there
are
ducks
and
where
hunters
go,
we
would
say,
using
the
indians
water
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
a
new
sporting
and
non-commercial
activity.
mr.
griswold
that
is
on
the
map
beyond
still
water
point
and
finally,
when
it
gets
to
still
water
wildlife
management
area
in
nearly
upper
right-hand
corner
and
the
swale
which
is
at
the
right
edge
of
the
map.
now,
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
water
there.
that
water
will
presumably
be
cut
down
and
allowed
to
go
down
the
truckee
river
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
district
columbia
court
in
the
case
requiring
the
secretary
to
conduct
a
more
careful
and
efficient
operation
of
the
(inaudible)
river
project.
mr.
griswold
the
water?
mr.
griswold
in
pyramid
lake?
mr.
griswold
that
is
essentially
fresh,
mr.
justice.
i
suppose
that
the
water
that
goes
into
the
wildlife
refuge,
is
essentially
fresh.
i
suppose
that
having
percolated
through
the
land,
it
has
picked
up
some
salts.
but
the
water
that
goes
down
the
truckee
river
is
particularly
fresh,
is
remarkably
fresh.
mr.
griswold
as
i
understand,
it
is
essentially
fresh
water
and
it
finally
percolates
into
the
ground
and
disappears.
pyramid
lake
is
more
saline
than
freshwater
lakes
we
are
used
to
in
this
part
of
the
country,
but
it
is
remarkably
non-saline
when
it
has
an
adequate
water
supply.
mr.
griswold
well,
it
isn't
even
quite
that
far,
mr.
justice.
we
don't
ask
for
enough
water
to
restore
the
level
of
the
lake
to
what
it
was
in
1859.
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
is
on
page
14,
prays
that
a
decree
to
be
entered
declaring
the
rights
of
the
united
states
for
the
benefit
of
the
pyramid
lake
paiute
tribe
of
indians
to
the
use
of
sufficient
waters
of
the
truckee
river
to
fulfill
the
purpose
for
which
the
pyramid
lake
reservation
was
created
including
the
maintenance
and
preservation
of
pyramid
lake
and
the
maintenance
of
the
lower
reaches
of
the
truckee
river
as
a
natural
spawning
ground
for
fish.
incidentally,
i
am
told
that
--
mr.
griswold
for
both,
for
both,
mr.
justice.
that
was
the
way
they
used
it
at
the
--
mr.
griswold
the
commercial
end
would
be
that
the
indians
would
sell
large
quantities
of
a
very
remarkable
fish
for
which
they
would
get
money,
with
which
they
would
buy
clothes
and
other
kinds
of
food.
mr.
griswold
they
have
historically,
mr.
justice.
there
have
been
substantial
fishery
establishments
there
including
the
canning
of
the
fish.
this
is
all
greatly
restricted.
we
are
told
that
by
council
for
the
states
that
there
are
only
400
indians
who
live
their
now,
but
there
are
500
who
don't
live
there
and
have
an
effect
been
driven
away
because
the
economic
possibilities
of
maintaining
themselves
have
gone
with
the
disappearance
of
the
fishery.
mr.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
the
indians
own
the
lake,
so
that
they
would
--
mr.
griswold
they
would
have
their
fishing
rights
if
there
were
adequate
fishes.
mr.
griswold
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
griswold
that
is
exactly
our
position.
i
would
suppose
that
the
only
question
here
apparently
arises
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
ohio
against
the
wyandotte
chemical
company
and
more
recently,
in
illinois
against
milwaukee
and
it
will
be
my
purpose
to
try
to
show
that
the
approach
taken
in
those
cases
is
not
applicable
here
and
thus,
motion
for
leave
to
file
the
complaint
should
be
granted.
this
case
does
not
raise
questions
of
state
or
local
law
as
was
the
situation
in
wyandotte.
the
questions
here
are
federal
questions
of
the
sort
which
this
court
has
traditionally
considered
in
original
suit.
the
united
states
appears
as
a
trustee
for
an
indian
tribe,
exercising
one
of
its
greatest
responsibilities
under
the
constitution.
the
questions
involved
are
federal
questions,
essentially
the
effect
of
the
establishment
of
an
indian
reservation
by
federal
authority
and
the
application
to
that
reservation
of
the
rule
of
the
case
of
winters
against
the
united
states
and
the
very
closely
comparable
case
of
arizona
against
california
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
where
the
united
states
intervened
in
an
original
suit
on
behalf
of
indian
tribes
and
this
court
made
essentially
the
same
sort
of
adjudication
that
we
are
seeking
here.
the
order
in
arizona
against
california
provides
that
a
million
in
acre
feet
of
water
shall
be
made
available
to
the
indians
at
the
suit
of
the
united
states
and
there
is
also
involved
the
effect
if
any,
on
the
rights
of
the
indians
from
the
establishment
of
the
newlands
irrigation
project
under
the
reclamation
act.
a
claim
made
by
the
--
mr.
griswold
newlands
project
was
authorized
in
1903,
there
was
a
suit
called
the
orr
water
ditch
suit
filed
in
1913
in
which
a
final
decree
was
entered
in
1944
and
one
of
the
questions
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
effect
of
that
on
the
residence
of
the
indians.
we
contend
that
it
does
not
bar
the
rights
of
the
indians
but
that's
one
of
the
issues
which
would
be
heard
if
they
leave
to
file,
the
complaint
was
granted.
the
claim
made
by
the
united
states
relates
to
the
waters
of
an
interstate
stream
and
thus,
presents
the
kind
of
question
appropriate
for
decision
by
this
court.
and
moreover
and
most
important,
this
court
is
the
only
tribunal
which
can
make
a
definitive
and
final
adjudication
of
the
right
claimed
on
behalf
of
the
indians
and
nevada
suggests
in
this
brief
that
the
suit
could
proceed
in
the
district
court
for
nevada,
despite
the
fact
that
most
of
the
water
comes
from
california
and
an
adjudication
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
the
indians
made
by
the
nevada
court
would
not
be
binding
on
california
or
on
california
citizens.
nevada
says
that
the
nevada
district
court
could
reach
california
and
its
citizens
through
some
sort
of
a
long-arm
approach.
perhaps
congress
could
authorize
this
and
for
a
period
of
four
years,
from
1922
to
1926,
congress
did
authorize
amount
to
interstate
suits
in
the
district
courts
with
respect
to
water
and
other
matters
and
some
of
the
cases
cited
here
began
in
that
period,
notably
the
brooks
case
which
was
a
contempt
case
for
violating
a
decree
which
was
involved
arizona
and
new
mexico
in
a
suit
brought
during
the
period
when
the
arizona
court
was
given
jurisdiction
over
parties
in
new
mexico.
congress
could
authorize
it
but
it
hasn't
done
so
and
i
know
of
no
basis
for
such
jurisdiction
in
a
case
like
this.
incidentally,
in
the
careful
and
thoughtful
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
california
here,
there
is
no
such
suggestion;
california
does
not
come
forward
and
say
it
wants
to
appear
in
nevada
district
court.
mr.
griswold
i
know
of
no
way
the
multi-district
deals
with
cases
where
the
court
has
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
issue.
here
the
nevada
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
california
water
rights.
the
california
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
nevada
water
rights
and
i
know
of
no
authority
under
the
multi-district
suit
to
require
them
to
get
together
and
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
on
the
questions
of
fact
or
of
law.
this
court
maybe
concerned
if
it
takes
jurisdiction
of
the
case
that
it
will
be
involved
in
a
multitude
of
factual
determinations
with
respect
to
individual
water
rights.
perhaps
there
are
thousands
of
persons
both
in
nevada
and
then
california,
i
think
that
concern
is
unwanted.
the
basic
question
here
is
an
important
one
and
it
may
present
some
legal
difficulties
but
the
problem
is
one
which
the
court
is
well-equipped
to
resolve.
the
question
raised
here
is
whether
the
united
states
has
any
right
on
behalf
of
the
pyramid
lake
indians,
and
if
so,
what
is
the
extent
of
that
right.
if
it
is
established
that
the
pyramid
lake
indians
are
entitled
to
a
definite
amount
of
water
with
a
fixed
temporal
priority
then
it
will
be
known
hot
water
remains
for
use
in
california
and
in
nevada.
at
that
point,
it
may
well
be
that
the
two
states
can
agree
on
their
relative
portions
of
the
remaining
water
as
they
have
agreed
in
a
compact
which
is
pending
before
congress
but
not
approved
by
congress
but
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
indians
have
no
rights.
the
compact
does
say
that
it
doesn't
deprive
anybody
of
any
rights
but
it
doesn't
recognize
that
there
are
any
such
right.
the
united
states
has
no
interest
whatever
in
how
the
allocation
to
california
and
nevada
is
divided
among
their
individual
water
users
and
the
district
court
in
nevada
can
make
the
appropriate
allocations
among
nevada
users
if
that
question
too
is
not
settled
by
agreement.
now
i
have
mentioned
the
compact
and
i
don't
have
time
to
discuss
it.
it
obviously
is
of
no
legal
significance
because
it
has
not
been
approved
by
congress.
incidentally,
both
senators
from
california
have
joined
in
a
statement
and
i
mention
this
because
it
indicates
the
unlikelihood
that
congress
is
going
to
prove
the
contract
if
both
senators
from
california
oppose
it.
they
have
joined
in
a
statement
in
which
they
conclude,
we
therefore
support
the
efforts
of
the
tribe
and
federal
government
to
obtain
a
judicial
determination
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
griswold
eventually,
it
might
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
basic
question
of
whether
the
indians
have
any
right
and
if
so
to
its
extent,
it
would
be
helpful
to
have
it
heard
before
master
but
it
would
be
a
relatively
simple
matter
before
a
master
and
not
the
question
of
allocating
water
rights
among
all
the
people
in
a
great
--
mr.
griswold
it
would
be
very
much
like
the
tidelands
although
perhaps
somewhat
simpler
that
that;
not
involving
the
massive
historical
considerations
that
were
there.
mr.
griswold
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference.
what
we
are
--
i
think
what
we
are
trying
to
say
in
that
is
that
it
ought
to
be
adjudicated
here
on
the
basic
issue,
do
the
indians
have
a
right
or
not.
before
there
is
any
consideration
given
to
the
problem,
how
you
allocate
the
remaining
water.
now
whether
--
mr.
griswold
there
haven't
been
answers
and
i
should
think
that
after
the
answers
have
been
filed
and
we
know
what
is
denied
and
what
needs
to
be
proved,
it
would
be
possible
at
that
point
to
it
could
well
be
that
the
answers
will
be
filed
in
such
form
as
to
raise
only
a
legal
question
at
least
at
the
threshold.
and
that
threshold
question,
do
the
indians
have
a
right
or
don't
they,
can
be
presented
as
a
purely
legal
question.
it
becomes
a
little
more
complicated
when
you
say,
yes
they
have
a
right
but
what
is
its
extent.
for
example,
the
indians
do
not
claim
that
they
are
entitled
375,000
acre
feet
every
year.
sometimes
the
water
goes
down,
i
think
their
position
would
be
that
they
are
entitled
to
an
average
of
375,000
acre
feet
over
a
period
of,
let's
say,
ten
years.
so
that
if
it
goes
down
one
year,
some
water
can
be
made
available
to
the
newlands
project
and
it
can
be
made
up
in
subsequent
years.
it's
undoubtedly
true
that
there
have
been
differences
of
opinion
and
conflicts
of
interest
within
the
interior
department
about
this
claim
of
the
pyramid
lake
indians.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
do
not
always
see
eye-to-eye.
it's
equally
true
that
the
department
of
justice
has
not
advanced
this
claim
in
prior
proceedings.
the
indians
should
not
be
bound
about
that.
there
will
be
argument
about
res
judicata
and
merger
and
bar
and
our
position
is
that
the
indian
should
not
be
bound
to
their
great
loss
by
reason
of
defaults
which
may
have
occurred
on
the
part
of
officers
of
the
united
states
in
the
past
and
i
don't
criticize
them
because
they
were
reflecting
a
national
attitude
at
that
time.
it
was
a
great
step
when
the
secretary
of
the
interior
requested
the
department
of
justice
to
start
this
case
in
this
court.
it
would
be
something
of
a
tragedy
for
the
indians
if
this
court
should
now
refuse
to
consider
the
claim
made
on
their
behalf.
mr.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
the
suit
pending
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
general
to
decide
whether
an
appeal
should
be
taken
and
the
decision
has
been
made
that
no
appeal
will
be
taken.
nevertheless,
that
case
involves
only
the
left-over,
only
the
run
off,
only
the
water
which
does
not
go
to
someone
else
by
right.
it
leaves
–
it
does
undertake
to
maximize
the
left-over
and
it
will
help
the
indians
but
it
gives
them
no
right.
that
water
can
be
appropriated
by
somebody
else,
it
remain
surplus
water
in
the
river.
it
can
be
appropriated
in
california,
it
can
be
appropriated
in
nevada.
the
only
way
that
the
indians
can
be
protected
is
by
having
an
adjudication
that
they
have
a
right
under
the
winters
doctrine
as
applied
by
this
court
most
recently
in
arizona
against
california.
i
am
also
advised
that
the
office
of
management
and
budget
has
authorized
the
filing
with
congress
of
a
statement
that
the
federal
government
opposes
the
ratification
of
the
compact
until
this
question
is
resolved.
i
would
point
out
too
that
in
the
compact
itself,
in
article
18
(c),
it
is
provided
that
the
compact
does
not
deal
with
the
rights
of
any
parties
which
are
not
specified
in
the
compact
and
that
was
intended
to
leave
open
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
there
was
an
adjudication
of
the
rights
of
the
indians.
mr.
griswold
under
the
case
in
colorado
the
--
mr.
griswold
--
that
would
be
true.
that
was
an
intrastate
stream
in
that
case.
there
is
no
way
--
mr.
griswold
with
respect
to
the
competing
claims
in
newlands
these
are
intrastate
claims
but
with
respect
to
the
claims
in
california
and
i
would
point
out
that
they
are
substantial,
we
have
filed
a
supplemental
reply
brief
here
which
recounts
the
or
sets
out
the
text
of
an
order
of
the
state
water
rights
board
in
california
which
granted
a
substantial
additional
amount
out
of
lake
tahoe
saying
that
in
that
decision
the
board
assumed
to
be
surplus
and
unappropriated.
the
water
from
lake
tahoe
and
the
truckee
river
flowing
by
derby
dam
which
is
not
required
to
satisfy
decreed
downstream
indian
rights
and
which
wastes
in
the
pyramid
lake.
the
only
decreed
rights
the
indians
have
is
30,000
feet
for
irrigation.
we
are
seeking
hereto
establish
decreed
rights
in
support,
in
favor
of
the
indians
to
maintain
the
level
of
pyramid
lake.
mr.
griswold
i
think
that
is
entirely
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
griswold
all
this
court
needs
to
do
here
is
to
determine
whether
the
indians
have
a
right
with
a
priority
--
mr.
griswold
all
this
court
needs
to
do
here
mr.
justice
is
to
determine
whether
the
indians
have
a
right
with
a
certain
priority.
mr.
griswold
no
mr.
justice.
all
that
they
need
to
do
is
to
determine
whether
the
indians
have
a
right
with
a
certain
priority
and
to
allocate
the
waters
of
the
stream
between
california
and
nevada
who
appear
as
parens
patriae
and
who
will
represent
the
water
users
in
those
states
just
as
they
did
in
arizona
against
california
or
exactly
this
was
done
--
mr.
griswold
the
suit
was
instituted
by
the
states
but
the
intervention
by
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
indians
was
against
this
--
the
suit
was
instituted
by
the
states
but
the
intervention
by
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
indians
was
by
the
united
states
and
against
the
states
and
this
court
adjudicated
the
rights
and
adjudicated
that
the
indians
were
entitled
to
a
million
acre
feet
in
that
case.
if
the
court
here
adjudicates
that
the
indians
are
entitled
to
a
right
with
a
certain
priority
and
allocates
that
between
the
two
states
which
is
what
it
did
in
arizona
against
california,
then
the
question
of
allocating
the
water
to
the
individual
users
which
is
allocated
to
nevada
in
the
one
case
can
be
handled
in
the
nevada
court
and
if
allocation
to
california
users
can
be
handled
in
the
california
court
--
mr.
griswold
they
are
represented
by
their
respective
states
as
has
been
the
case
in,
i
think
i
am
safe
to
saying
dozens
of
cases
involving
interstate
water
rights
before
this
court,
where
the
states
appears
parens
patriae.
