mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
california
basically
agrees
with
the
arguments
which
have
been
advanced
by
the
state
of
nevada
and
we
feel
that
very
basically
the
pyramid
lake
problem
is
presently
being
solved
by
many
alternative
methods
at
the
legislative
level,
the
judicial
level,
the
administrative
level
and
we
want
the
court
to
--
as
far
as
california
is
concerned,
the
real
basic
question
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
of
california
and
nevada
is
not
really
how
whether
we
are
going
to
solve
the
pyramid
lake
problem,
but
rather
how
we
are
going
to
proceed
to
solve
it.
now
the
federal
task
force
has
come
in
with
a
report
about
two
years
ago
and
said
that,
vast
amounts
of
water
were
being
wasted
in
the
truckee
river
basin
by
the
federal
government's
own
mismanagement
of
its
own
reclamation
project,
the
newlands
project,
task
force
had
made
a
number
of
recommendations
provided
the
federal
government
could
improve
the
facilities
and
improve
the
management
of
these
systems
and
make
additional
water
available
for
use
in
pyramid
lake
and
if
these
recommendations
are
followed
and
are
applied
by
the
federal
government,
the
problem
of
pyramid
lake
will
be
solved.
now
the
same
approach
was
taken
more
recently
in
a
lawsuit
which
or
in
a
decision
rendered
in
the
federal
district
court
in
washinton
dc,
judge
gesell
presiding.
this
lawsuit
was
brought
by
the
indians
against
the
federal
government.
the
indians
claiming
that
the
federal
government
was
violating
it's
fiduciary
obligation
to
the
indians
by
wasting
all
this
water
in
the
river
and
thus
failing
to
maximize
the
flow
of
the
truckee
river
into
pyramid
lake
and
judge
gesell
upheld
the
position
of
the
indians
and
he
said
that
the
vast
amounts
of
water
were
in
fact
being
wasted
in
the
truckee
river
by
the
mismanagement
of
the
newlands
project.
he
then
ordered
the
federal
government
to
devise
a
regulation
that
will
provide
for
salvage
water
which
can
go
into
pyramid
lake
and
so
if
judge
gesell's
decision
is
implemented
by
the
federal
government
and
is
followed
and
the
water
thus
required
to
be
made
available
to
pyramid
lake
actually
made
available
again,
pyramid
lake
would
receive
all
the
water
that
it
needs
and
the
problem
would
be
solved.
so
there
be
no
need
for
this
court
or
any
other
court
to
really
get
involved
with
the
question
which
is
being
posed
by
the
federal
government
in
this
case.
as
matter
of
fact
perhaps
you
will
find,
after
judge
gesell's
decision
is
applied
and
after
the
task
force
recommendation
are
followed
that
there
is
in
fact,
enough
water
in
the
truckee
river
right
now
to
satisfy
all
the
demands
which
are
being
made
upon
it.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
i
think
it
would
be
justice
white
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
if
judge
gesell's
decision
was
carried
out
then
pyramid
lake
would
probably
receive
on
the
average
about
385000
acre
feet
of
water
per
year
and
this
is
all
the
federal
government
is
really
asking
for
on
the
behalf
of
the
indians
in
this
case
but
it's
very
interesting
justice
white
how
judge
gesell
has
approached
the
problem
and
how
the
task
force
approached
the
problem,
really
differs
from
the
approach
taken
by
the
federal
government.
the
judge
gesell's
approach
and
the
task
force
approach
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
we
have
to
preserve
existing
water
usage
in
the
upstream
area
in
the
truckee
river
basin
and
this
is
diametrically
opposite
from
the
approach
being
urged
on
this
court
by
the
federal
government.
suppose
for
instance,
385000
acre
feet
of
water
were
flowing
through
the
truckee
river
in
a
very
dry
year,
when
less
than
a
normal
amount
of
rainfall
occurs
in
the
sierras,
the
approach
taken
by
the
federal
government
would
take
the
entire
385000
acre
feet
of
water
and
put
it
solely
for
use
in
pyramid
lake
thus
there
would
be
no
water
left
over
for
any
upstream
usage.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
not
according
to
the
prayer
and
the
government's
complaint
which
i
believe
is
found
at
page
14
and
15
of
its
complaint.
they
are
asking
for
a
set
minimum
yearly
flow
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
well
the
solicitor
general
remarks,
i
think,
very
somewhat
from
his
prayer.
if
you
look
at
his
prayer
justice
white,
on
pages
14
and
15,
you
will
find
that
they
are
asking
for
a
minimum
flow
measured
in
terms
of
acre
feet
to
the
pyramid
lake.
and
if
there
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
that
is
possibly
true,
your
honor
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
if
a
court
takes
the
case,
if
this
court
takes
the
case
and
proceeds
the
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction
in
the
matter,
than
the
whole
task
force
will
come
to
a
halt.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
well
that
is
–
well
then
you
are
--
you
are
really
by
taking
the
case
merely
duplicating,
this
is
our
whole
point,
you
are
really
duplicating
what
judge
gesell
has
already
found
and
you
are
duplicating
what
the
task
force
has
already
recommended.
if
the
problem
is
actually
being
it
solved
by
administrative
and
other
judicial
means
then
i
see
no
bases
or
justification
for
this
court
actually
exercising
it's
discretion
in
the
case.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
no
justice
brennan.
i
understand
that
the
federal
government
is
not
going
to
take
an
appeal
from
judge
gesell's
decision
and
that
is
presumably
it
should
apply
judge
gesell's
decision
and
that
is
provide
pyramid
lake
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
i
frankly
do
not
know
how
the
solicitor
general
will
respond
to
judge
gesell's
decree
if
the
court
takes
the
case,
i
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes
that
is
correct
justice
white
there
is
the
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
we
are
talking
now,
yes
that's
correct.
so
in
effect
the
federal
government
is
coming
before
this
court
and
really
asking
for
a
solution
of
the
problem
that
i
think
has
already
been
found.
if
the
court
applies
judge
gesell's
decision,
i
think
the
problem
should
be
solved.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
well,
i
am
not
i
see
justice
brennan,
i
am
not
sure
what
reaction
the
solicitor
general
will
take
to
judge
gesell's
decision,
if
the
court
takes
the
case.
certainly
i
don't
think
that
they
will
follow
through
with
the
task
force
recommendations,
as
matter
of
fact,
the
task
force
made
a
number
of
recommendations
and
the
federal
government,
i
would
assume
would
not
comply
with
those
recommendations,
if
the
court
takes
the
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
recommendations
have
not
been
complied
with
so
far,
federal
government
is
in
effect,
trying
to
implement
it
weather
modifications
scheme
which
the
task
force
suggested
but
that's
the
only
task
force's
suggestions
that
has
been
followed
by
the
federal
government
in
this
case.
the
task
force
found
a
number
of
other
things
that
federal
government
can
do.
the
federal
government
has
taken
no
action
on
those
other
recommendations
and
i
would
assume
that
the
reason
is
that
it
prefers
to
seek
a
judicial
solution
in
this
court
in
which
the
winter's
doctrine
question
is
adjudicated.
the
underlying
assumptions
behind
judge
gesell's
approach
to
the
problem
and
behind
the
task
force
approach
is
that
the
federal
government
itself
really
controls
the
lion's
share
of
water
flowing
though
the
truckee
river.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
that
is
the
only
approach
he
could
take,
that
is
right
justice
rehnquist
but
there
is
a
sufficient
solution
to
the
problem,
we
believe
whether
it
is
justice
or
judge
gesell
was
in
fact
saying
that
there
is
vast
amount
of
water
which
is
being
wasted
in
the
reclamation
project,
that
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
control
this
waste,
it
has
the
power
to
eliminate
the
waste
and
if
it
follows
these
suggestions
or
the
order
of
judge
gesell
and
the
task
forces,
and
makes
the
water
available
for
use
in
pyramid
lake
then
the
whole
problem
is
solved.
i
would
remind
the
court
that
all
the
parties
who
are
receiving
water
now
in
the
newlands
reclamation
project,
and
all
the
other
parties
who
are
receiving
water
in
nevada,
and
all
the
parties
who
are
receiving
water
in
california
are
not
before
this
court
either.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
judge
gesell
just
had
the
federal
government
before
him
and
he
ordered
the
federal
government
to
adopt
regulations
which
i
think
should
solve
the
problem.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
they
could
be,
i
suppose
that
they
could
be.
that
raises
a
very
interesting
question.
the
federal
government
is
in
effect
trying
to
have
the
water's
right
adjudicated
on
the
behalf
of
the
indians
and
this
is
a
water
right
which
would
be
taken
out
at
the
share
of
water
which
is
allocated
to
the
state
of
nevada.
well
i
don't
see
how
this
court
can
adjudicate
the
right
of
one
water
user
in
the
truckee
river.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
that's
correct.
in
that
case
justice
white
all
the
–
as
my
understanding
of
case
is
that
all
the
competing
water
users
were
before
the
court
and
there
was
--
the
indians
were
before
the
court
and
all
the
other
water
users
were
before
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
federal
government
is
asserting
a
water
claim
on
behalf
of
the
indians
and
seeking
to
have
this
court
adjudicate
that
water
claim,
even
though
there
are
many
conflicting
or
supposedly
conflicting
water
claims
in
nevada
which
these
are
of
some
consideration
also.
i
don't
see
how
this
court
can
really
adjudicate
the
water
claim
which
is
to
asserted
by
one
user
in
the
truckee
basin
without
asserting
the
water
claims
adjudicated
by
all
the
truckee
river
users.
so
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
let
the
matter
proceed
and
to
let
the
decision
of
judge
gesell
be
implemented
and
the
recommendations
of
the
task
force
be
followed.
we
think
that
this
provides
a
constructive
solution
to
problem
which
will
effectively
preserve
the
rights
and
the
uses
of
the
upstream
water
users.
the
people
out
in
the
rene
area
need
water
every
year
for
drinking
purposes.
the
farmers
in
the
newlands
project
need
water
for
agriculture
purposes
and
judge
gesell
i
think
has
pointed
to
a
constructive
solution
to
the
problem
so
has
the
task
force
if
the
right
problem
solved,
so
the
matter
i
think
is
pre-maturely
brought
by
the
federal
government
at
this
time.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
california
basically
agrees
with
the
arguments
which
have
been
advanced
by
the
state
of
nevada
and
we
feel
that
very
basically
the
pyramid

problem
is

the
judicial

the
administrative
level
and
we
want
the
court
to
--
as
far
as
california
is
concerned,
the
real
basic
question
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
of
california
and
nevada
is
not
really
how
whether
we
are
going
to
solve
the
pyramid
lake
problem,
but
rather
how
we
are
going
to
proceed
to
solve
it.
now
the
federal
task
force
has
come
in
with
a
report
about
two
years
ago
and
said
that,
vast
amounts
of
water

and
if
these
recommendations
are
followed
and
are
applied
by
the
federal

the
problem
of
pyramid
lake
will
be
solved.
now
the
same
approach
was
taken
more
recently
in
a
lawsuit
which
or
in
a
decision
rendered
in
the
federal
district
court

judge

this
lawsuit
was
brought
by
the
indians
against
the
federal

the
indians
claiming
that
the
federal

it's

judge

upheld

he
said
that

vast

actually
made
available
again,
pyramid
lake
would
receive
all
the
water
that
it

and
the

would
be

so
there
be
no

any

to
really
get
involved
with
the

mr.

mr.

about
385000

and
this
is

the

on

in
this
case
but
it's
very

how

approached
the

and
how
the
task

approached
the

really

the

mr.

roderick
walston
not
according
to
the
prayer
and
the
government's
complaint
which
i
believe
is
found
at
page
14
and
15
of
its
complaint.
they
are
asking
for
a
set
minimum
yearly
flow
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
well
the
solicitor
general
remarks,
i
think,
very
somewhat
from
his
prayer.
if
you
look
at
his
prayer
justice
white,
on
pages
14

15,
you
will
find
that
they
are
asking
for
a
minimum
flow
measured
in
terms
of
acre
feet
to
the
pyramid
lake.
and
if
there
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
that
is
possibly
true,
your
honor
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
if
a
court
takes
the
case,
if
this
court
takes
the
case
and
proceeds
the
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction
in
the
matter,
than
the
whole
task
force
will
come
to
a
halt.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
well
that
is
–
well
then
you
are
--
you
are
really
by
taking
the
case
merely
duplicating,
this
is
our
whole
point,
you
are
really
duplicating
what
judge
gesell
has
already
found
and
you
are
duplicating
what
the
task
force
has
already
recommended.
if
the
problem
is
actually
being
it
solved
by
administrative
and
other
judicial
means
then
i
see
no
bases
or
justification
for
this
court
actually
exercising
it's
discretion
in
the
case.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
no
justice
brennan.
i
understand
that
the
federal
government
is
not
going
to
take
an
appeal
from
judge
gesell's
decision
and
that
is
presumably
it
should
apply
judge
gesell's
decision
and
that
is
provide
pyramid
lake
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
i
frankly
do
not
know
how
the
solicitor
general
will
respond
to
judge
gesell's
decree
if
the
court
takes
the
case,
i
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes
that
is
correct
justice
white
there
is
the
--
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
we
are
talking
now,
yes
that's
correct.
so
in
effect
the
federal
government
is
coming
before
this
court
and
really
asking
for
a
solution
of
the
problem
that
i
think
has
already
been
found.
if
the
court
applies
judge
gesell's
decision,
i
think
the
problem
should
be
solved.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
well,
i
am
not
i
see
justice
brennan,
i
am
not
sure
what
reaction
the
solicitor
general
will
take
to
judge
gesell's
decision,
if
the
court
takes
the
case.
certainly
i
don't
think
that
they
will
follow
through
with
the
task
force
recommendations,
as
matter
of
fact,
the
task
force
made
a
number
of
recommendations
and
the
federal
government,
i
would
assume
would
not
comply
with
those
recommendations,
if
the
court
takes
the
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
recommendations
have
not
been
complied
with
so
far,
federal
government
is
in
effect,
trying
to
implement
it
weather
modifications
scheme
which
the
task
force
suggested
but
that's
the
only
task
force's
suggestions
that
has
been
followed
by
the
federal
government
in
this
case.
the
task
force
found
a
number
of
other
things
that
federal
government
can
do.
the
federal
government
has
taken
no
action
on
those
other
recommendations
and
i
would
assume
that
the
reason
is
that
it
prefers
to
seek
a
judicial
solution
in
this
court
in
which
the
winter's
doctrine
question
is
adjudicated.
the
underlying
assumptions
behind
judge
gesell's
approach
to
the
problem
and
behind
the
task
force
approach
is
that
the
federal
government
itself
really
controls
the
lion's
share
of
water
flowing
though
the
truckee
river.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
that
is
the
only
approach
he
could
take,
that
is
right
justice
rehnquist
but
there
is
a
sufficient
solution
to
the
problem,
we
believe
whether
it
is
justice
or
judge
gesell
was
in
fact
saying
that
there
is
vast
amount
of
water
which
is
being
wasted
in
the
reclamation
project,
that
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
control
this
waste,
it
has
the
power
to
eliminate
the
waste
and
if
it
follows
these
suggestions
or
the
order
of
judge
gesell
and
the
task
forces,
and
makes
the
water
available
for
use
in
pyramid
lake
then
the
whole
problem
is
solved.
i
would
remind
the
court
that
all
the
parties
who
are
receiving
water
now
in
the
newlands
reclamation
project,
and
all
the
other
parties
who
are
receiving
water
in
nevada,
and
all
the
parties
who
are
receiving
water
in
california
are
not
before
this
court
either.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
judge
gesell
just
had
the
federal
government
before
him
and
he
ordered
the
federal
government
to
adopt
regulations
which
i
think
should
solve
the
problem.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
they
could
be,
i
suppose
that
they
could
be.
that
raises
a
very
interesting
question.
the
federal
government
is
in
effect
trying
to
have
the
water's
right
adjudicated
on
the
behalf
of
the
indians
and
this
is
a
water
right
which
would
be
taken
out
at
the
share
of
water
which
is
allocated
to
the
state
of
nevada.
well
i
don't
see
how
this
court
can
adjudicate
the
right
of
one
water
user
in
the
truckee
river.
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
jr.
roderick
walston
that's
correct.
in
that
case
justice
white
all
the
–
as
my
understanding
of
case
is
that
all
the
competing
water
users
were
before
the
court
and
there
was
--
the
indians
were
before
the
court
and
all
the
other
water
users
were
before
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
federal
government
is
asserting
a
water
claim
on
behalf
of
the
indians
and
seeking
to
have
this
court
adjudicate
that
water
claim,
even
though
there
are
many
conflicting
or
supposedly
conflicting
water
claims
in
nevada
which
these
are
of
some
consideration
also.
i
don't
see
how
this
court
can
really
adjudicate
the
water
claim
which
is
to
asserted
by
one
user
in
the
truckee
basin
without
asserting
the
water
claims
adjudicated
by
all
the
truckee
river
users.
so
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
let
the
matter
proceed
and
to
let
the
decision
of
judge
gesell
be
implemented
and
the
recommendations
of
the
task
force
be
followed.
we
think
that
this
provides
a
constructive
solution
to
problem
which
will
effectively
preserve
the
rights
and
the
uses
of
the
upstream
water
users.
the
people
out
in
the
rene
area
need
water
every
year
for
drinking
purposes.
the
farmers
in
the
newlands
project
need
water
for
agriculture
purposes
and
judge
gesell
i
think
has
pointed
to
a
constructive
solution
to
the
problem
so
has
the
task
force
if
the
right
problem
solved,
so
the
matter
i
think
is
pre-maturely
brought
by
the
federal
government
at
this
time.
