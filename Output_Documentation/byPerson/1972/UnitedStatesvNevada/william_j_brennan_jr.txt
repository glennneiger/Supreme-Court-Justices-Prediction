what
has
held
it
up
for
17
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
that
solicitor
general
suggested
that
senators
of
california
would
prefer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
would
suppose
as
a
practical
matter,
if
senators
in
one
of
be
contracted
states
opposed
there
is
no
chance
of
congress
would
approve
it,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
any
judicial
review
being
sought
of
judge
gesell's
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
your
point
is
if
we
accept
this
case,
that
enforcement
of
judge
gesell's
decree
will
stop,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
not
mean
if
the
court
applies,
you
mean
if
it
is
applied
and
enforced
by
the
secretary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
you
are
suggesting
as
i
understood
you
was
that
we
take
this
case,
the
secretary
will
not
apply
to
force
judge
gesell's
order,
but
it
will
wait
on
the
outcome
of
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
not
before
judge
gesell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
thought
you
said,
at
least
i
did
not
that
we
would
not
have
to
get
in
or
bring
in
these
other
claimants
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what's
your
observation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
that
would
not
decide
vis-a-vis
the
other
claimants
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
know
but
if
that
priory

that
that
other
water
users
in
the

get
half
the
water
they

to,
you
are
foreclosing
them.
