mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
defendant
state
of
nevada
in
this
original
action.
in
the
few
minutes
alloted
to
me
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
discuss
some
of
the
purely
legal
questions
in
our
briefs
such
as
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
and
even
case
or
controversy
against
the
state.
i
am
going
to
have
to
rely
on
our
brief
for
those
points.
instead
my
argument
here
is
going
to
be
restricted
to
the
reasons
why
this
court
should
not
in
its
discretion
assuming
that
it
has
jurisdiction,
why
it
should
not
exercise
that
original
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
in
case
after
case,
after
case,
this
court
has
emphasized,
that
state
should
work
out
problems
relating
to
mutual
boundaries
or
interstate
stream
themselves,
if
they
can
do
it
and
in
case
after
case
it
was
only
after
such
attempts
that
reconciliation
between
the
states
had
failed
that
this
court
had
agreed
to
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction.
now,
here
what
do
we
have?
we
have
the
two
states
where
the
disputed
water
is
located,
agreeing
after
more
than
15
years
of
negotiations
on
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
waters
involved.
we
have
a
joint
task
force
that
the
government
participated
in
after
long
study
finally
agreeing
on
recommendations
which
as
is
already
been
noted,
have
already
begun
to
increase
the
water
procurement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
water
level
has
risen
some
11
and
12
feet
in
the
last
few
years,
ever
since
the
interior
department
has
begun
concentrating
on
their
operating
criteria
and
putting
them
in
one
shape.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
indians
originally
participated
in
the
taskforce,
withdrew,
then
submitted
statements
and
witnesses
in
regard
to
the
compact.
they
specifically
made
some
objections
to
the
compact
as
it
was
originally
drafted
and
those
objections
were
taken
into
consideration
and
this
is
quite
important,
let
me
give
you
two
examples.
originally,
the
california
was
given
an
unlimited
right
to
create
extra
--
to
create
extra
flow,
to
create
extra
water
after
the
original
tahoe
basin
was
taken
care
of.
the
indians
objected
to
that
and
a
10,000
acre
foot
limit
was
put
on
california's
right.
in
another
example
the
indians
were
given
a
maximum
right
based
on
orr
water
ditch
plus
municipal
and
other
use
which
was
actually
being
put
to
the
beneficial
use,
they
could
not
get
anymore
water
after
that.
that
was
eliminated
because
of
their
objection.
so
that
after
their
orr
water
ditch
commitment
now
and
after
california's
share
comes
out,
then
the
use
goes
back
to
nevada
again
and
the
indians
have
a
full
right
to
get
the
amount
of
money
--
the
amount
of
water
that
they
can
show
that
they
need
from
that.
these
are
two
examples
of
objections
which
the
indians
had
at
the
compact
and
which
were
taken
care
of
in
the
compact.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
the
compact
will
not
become
operative
until
congress
approves
it
and
we
think
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
been
intimately
involved
in
the
development
of
the
compact
that
the
--
and
in
view
of
further
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
nevada
is
also
concerned
about
the
indians
rights
and
making
sure
that
this
level
of
the
lake
is
at
certain
level.
we
think
that
they
should
be
presenting
their
arguments
to
congress
rather
than
here
in
view
of
this
long
history
of
negotiations
between
the
states
where
finally,
unlike
these
other
cases
where
you
had
where
the
states
have
been
unable
to
come
to
agreement,
we
have
been
unable
--
we
have
been
able
to
come
to
an
agreement
and
the
agreement
is
such
that
the
indians
could
not
possibly
be
damaged.
the
united
states
doesn't
claim
that
they
are
going
to
be
damaged
by
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
indians
obviously
would
much
prefer
a
declaration
by
this
court
that
they
have
a
winters
right
to
x
amount
of
the
water.
they
undoubtedly
would
prefer
that
to
the
compact.
on
the
other
hand,
our
position
is
that
if
the
compact
is
approved,
california's
share
is
so
small,
it's
a
maximum
45,000
acre
feet.
you
have
got
560
-
80,000
acre
feet
of
water
here
involved
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
harmed
by
california's
share.
you
are
going
to
have
plenty
of
water
coming
into
nevada
and
if
a
problem
arises
later,
then
the
indians
can
sue
at
the
appropriate
time
either
they
can
sue
in
nevada.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
they
would
not
be
suing
against
the
compact
mr.
justice
marshall
because
the
compact
would
leave
plenty
of
water
in
nevada
for
their
share.
you
understand
that
the
indians
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
sir,
i
beg
a
differ
what
if
a
fish,
the
united
states
has
told
the
judge,
it
could
sell
or
thrive
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
fish
is
thriving
today
because
of
great
improvement
in
the
level
of
pyramid
lake
and
another
things
which
are
taking
place
there
through
the
secretary
of
interior's
operating
criteria.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
undoubtedly
would
have
to
appoint
a
master.
if
you
accept
this
case,
let
me
tell
you
what's
going
to
happen.
first
of
all,
the
compact
is
going
to
come
to
a
halt.
congress
obviously
is
not
going
to
approve
the
compact
while
the
issue
is
now
pending
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
compacts
has
been
almost
17
years.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
number
two
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
you
were
to
take
an
extreme
case
where
so
much
water
was
given
to
california
that
in
effect
obliterated
the
indian's
rights,
i
think
that
there
would
be
authority
to
do
that
in
the
same
way
that
you
could
takeaway
a
man's
land
through
an
international
treaty
with
say
canada
or
mexico.
i
think
that
it
would
supersede,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
again
that
there
is
no
question
about
in
this
case
because
if
you
look
at
what
the
indians
are
asking,
when
they
say
winter's
right,
they
are
not
talking
about
some
esoteric
theory
where
this
court
says
winters
right
to
put
some
stamp
on.
they
are
asking
for
enough
water
to
maintain
the
lake
namely
385,000
acre
feet.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
winters
right,
yes
sir.
that
comes
from
the
winters
case
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
mr.
justice,
where
you
have
first
discussed
the
fact
that
there
was
an
implied
reservation
of
water
along
with
an
indian
reservation
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
let
me
show
you
exactly
how
it
would
work.
the
compact
is
approved.
at
that
point
california
takes
out
as
i
say
at
a
maximum
and
this
really
is
a
maximum
45,000
acre
feet.
so
you
now
have
over
300,000
acre
feet
flowing
into
nevada.
if,
thereafter,
the
indians
were
not
getting
their
sufficient
share,
in
view
of
your
ruling,
that
their
share
would
be
allocated
to
the
state,
they
would
then
sue
the
state
of
nevada
and
the
nevada
federal
district
court
to
get
their
portion
of
the
300,000
that
was
a
part
of
the
state's
use.
in
other
words,
they
would
sue
nevada
because
the
only
disagreement
would
be
between
the
indians
on
the
one
hand
and
the
amount
of
water
the
nevada
has
now
collected
on
the
other.
there
would
be
no
conflict
or
controversies
with
california.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
do,
although
i
am
not
going
to
take
the
time
to
argue
it
here.
we
do
claim
that
california
could
be
brought
into
the
state
of
nevada.
there
is
recent
case
by
the
california
supreme
court
called
hall
versus
university
of
nevada
which
we
say
supports
that
idea,
but
i
do
not
have
to
take
that
position
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
our
point
is
this
that
if
you
allow
congress
to
act,
now
what
has
happened
here.
the
compact
has
been
placed
in
the
congress.
their
appropriate
committees
have
been
asked
for
the
comments
of
the
united
states--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
negotiation
on
what
the
shares
were
going
to
be.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
no
no
no
it
is
only
been
before
congress
the
last
session
and
this
session
that
is
the
only
it
has
been
before
congress,
all
of
these
some
15
years
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
there
are
two
senators
which
have
made
statements
on
behalf
of
the
indians
in
california.
i
would
prefer
that
mr.
walston
speaking
for
california
address
himself
to
that,
but
i
do
not
think
obviously
that
is
going
to
control.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
would
hope
that
they
would
see
the
light
mr.
justice
and
particularly
after
you
do
not
allow
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
justice
if
you
take
this
case
i
can
assure
you
as
a
practical
matter
there
are
a
number
of
things
are
going
to
happen.
first
of
all
congress
is
going
to
stop
dead
in
its
tracks
in
trying
to
prove
the
contract.
secondly
the
various
recommendations
that
have
been
made
by
the
task
force
for
proving
the
lake
are
going
to
stop
because
nobody
is
going
to
know
how
much
water
has
to
go
to
the
indians.
the
interior
secretory
is
operating
criteria
which
he
is
now
under
order
to
improve
here
and
which
he
is
going
to
produce
still
more
water,
if
he
has
jurisdiction
to
do
it
for
pyramid
lake
are
going
to
come
a
complete
hall
again
because
nobody
is
going
to
know
what
we
are
talking
about
here
in
terms
of
these
winters
rights.
i
emphasize
to
you
that
a
winters
right
is
not
some
is
not
some
definite
specific
figure.
you
have
to
go
back
and
find
out
what
the
situation
was
in
1859
at
the
time
the
reservation
was
created,
what
the
indians
were
doing,
we
are
not
as
all
sure
as
the
solicitor
general
that
they
were
engaged
in
all
this
much
fisheries
for
example
and
we
have
to
go
through
that
entire
business.
orr
water
ditch
which
is
a
case
which
adjudicated
we
say
that
very
rights
that
are
under
consideration
here
took
i
think
it
was
something
like
20
years
for
them
to
come
to
any
conclusion.
now
orr
water
ditch
you
understand
already
gives
the
indians
30,000
acre
fit
a
year,
that
is
adjudicated.
and
we
say
that,
that
actually
covers
this
case
in
is
fully
determinative,
but
even
if
it
isn't,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
what
the
indians
want
they
are
either
getting
or
about
to
get.
they
want
385,000
acre
feet,
that
is
what
their
brief
says,
that
is
what
the
united
states
said,
because
385,000
acre
feet
is
going
to
sustain
that
lake
at
its
present
level,
that
is
what
they
want.
now
when
we
turn
to
that
what
do
we
find?
we
find
that
there
is
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
water
increasing
recently
into
pyramid
lake
because
of
the
changes
that
i
have
talked
about
and
we
also
have
these
specific
recommendations
of
the
task
force,
some
of
which
you
been
carried
out.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
one
of
the
things
the
task
forces
recommended
was
a
cloud
seeding
project.
well
that
sounds
a
little
far
out,
but
in
true
we
are
now
into
the
third
year
because
of
that
recommendation
of
the
cloud
seeding
project
and
they
found
in
the
first
two
years
that
there
was
a
14%
and
a
10%
increase
in
precipitation
as
a
result
of
that.
in
hard
cold
fact,
that
14%
produces
140,000
acre
fit
of
water,
a
120,000
of
which
goes
to
pyramid.
this
is
one
of
the
reason
why
pyramid,
we
think
is
started
back
up
again.
there
are
other
recommendations
that
the
taskforce
made.
they
said
for
example
if
you
enforce
your
present
decrees,
if
you
will
go
into
district
court
with
the
decrees
that
you
have
right
now
and
enforce
them
that
you
will
find,
and
they
gave
a
specific
figure
of
how
much
of
that
would
produce,
9500
acre
feet
there.
they
talked
about
certain
tcid
improvements,
the
truckee-carson
irrigation
district
improvements
which
would
produce
another
85,000
and
so
we
have
these
recommendations,
part
of
which
are
being
implemented
right
now
and
part
of
which
we
will
be,
if
the
court
does
not
take
things
over,
which
we
say
is
already
beginning
to
sustain
the
lake
and
would
certainly
will
sustain
the
lake
if
you
do
not
take
this
case
in
which
if
everybody
is
allowed
to
proceed.
for
example
if
you
do
not
take
this
case
and
i
might
say
we
think
that
united
states
is
suing
the
wrong
party,
we
think
here
they
ought
be
suing
themselves
because
judge
gesell
took
the
position
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
not
properly
carrying
out
his
responsibility
and
his
own
operating
criteria
and
we
say
that
if
you
combine
these
various
factors,
if
you
combine
the
compact,
if
you
combine
the
recommendations
that
have
been
made
some
of
which
you
have
already
been
carried
out,
if
you
add
into
that
judge
gesell's
order
about
improving
his
operating
criteria,
you
are
going
to
have
more
than
enough
water
for
pyramid
lake.
we
hope,
obviously
i
cannot
guarantee
that,
but
we
say
until
these
things
have
had
an
opportunity
to
show
themselves,
until
we
have
had
an
opportunity
and
good
faith
to
carry
out
what's
going
on
here,
why
should
we
stop
the
whole
thing
right
now
after
the
17
years,
bring
it
all
to
a
halt
and
suddenly
have
this
court
appoint
a
special
master
and
go
back
and
begin
determining
for
i
do
not
know
how
many
additional
years
what
the
winters
rights
says.
if
there
was
a
question
about
what
they
really
wanted
from
these
winters
rights,
i
would
take
a
different
position,
but
there
is
no
question
they
want
385,000
acre
feet.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
it's
--
in
the
first
place
in
united
states
is
not
responded
to
congress'
request
for
comments,
i
am
sure
because
of
this
case
and
won't
until
there
is
some
decision
here,
that
is
number
one.
number
two,
there
are
projects
which
have
been
recommended
by
the
taskforce
which
require
money
and
obviously
i
do
not
think
the
state
can
be
expected
to
commit
any
funds,
if
we
are
willing
to,
with
not
knowing
what
the
indians
were
eventually
going
to
get
and
also
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question,
but
that
judge
gesell's
order
be
ignored
in
affect
in
ignorance
of
this
court
were
to
take
jurisdiction
because
obviously
a
ruling
here
would
in
affect
override
much
of
what
he
has
done.
so
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
practical
affect
would
be.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir
it
is
a
s.
24
and
h.
r.
15
at
the
moment.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
nevada
there
is
a
room
full
of
records
relating
to
orr
water
ditch.
perfectly
true
he
could
go
through
them
but
it
has
got
a
long
hard
difficult
task
ahead
of
him
and
i
do
not
want
to
mislead
you
for
a
moment
that
this
is
a
question
of
sitting
down
and
reading
to
a
few
papers
and
coming
to
a
conclusion.
everybody
who
dealt
with
this
problem
has
found
it
extraordinarily
difficult,
it
has
taken
an
awful
long
time.
may
i
just
end
by
quoting
to
you
something
that
was
said
just
last
year
by
the
national
water
commission
that
was
appointed
by
the
president.
it
said
the
future
utilization
of
indian
rights
on
fully
appropriated
streams
will
divest
prior
uses
initiated
under
state
law
and
curiously
enough
often
financed
with
federal
funds
and
will
impose
economic
hardship
amounting
to
disaster
in
some
cases
on
users
with
large
investments
made
over
long
period
of
time.
that
is
the
reason
that
the
state
of
nevada
is
concerned
because
obviously
we
have
an
interest
in
the
indians
in
preserving
the
some
400
indians,
but
we
are
also
terribly
concerned
about
the
water
that
goes
in
the
newlands
and
irrigates
some
64,000
acres
of
land.
we
are
concerned
about
the
quarter
of
million
people
in
the
area
who
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
sir
when
you
get
the
wildlife
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh
no
sir,
you
mean
newlands
used
ducks?
no
sir
newlands,
the
stow
off
from
newlands
helps
the
still
water
a
wildlife
refuge,
but
you
have
got
64,000
acres
of
land
out
there
under
irrigation
sir.
you
have
got
5000
farmers
you
have
a
quarter
of
million
people
in
the
area
who
are
depending
upon
the
water
from
the
truckee.
we
are
not
talking
about
protecting
ducks.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
but
it
spill
off
sir
its
what
left
over
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
cannot
give
you
the
actual
percentage
but
i
tell
you
it
is
not
the
original
use
at
all
sir.
the
it's
the
runoff
that
goes
down
to
still
water,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
that
is
the
reason
for
our
concern
here
that
yes
there
are
the
indians
interest
and
obviously
they
have
some
rights.
we're
not
trying
to
do
away
with
those
rights.
we
did
in
the
compact
as
united
states
agreed,
but
there
is
also
the
interest
of
an
awful
lot
of
other
people
here
that
we
want
to
make
sure
are
also
protected.
we
think
we
are
in
good
faith
after
these
negotiations.
there
is
tremendous
amount
of
it
--
$1.50
million
dollars
spent
on
getting
this
compact.
we
think
we
are
entitled
now
to
proceed
and
if
by
any
chance,
it
doesn't
work,
if
the
light
goes
down
again,
they
can
come
back,
light
can
come
back
very
much.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
defendant
state
of
nevada
in
this
original
action.
in
the
few
minutes
alloted
to
me
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
discuss
some
of
the
purely
legal
questions
in
our
briefs
such
as
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
and
even
case
or
controversy
against
the
state.
i
am
going
to
have
to
rely
on
our
brief
for
those
points.
instead
my
argument
here
is
going
to
be
restricted
to
the
reasons
why
this
court
should
not
in
its
discretion
assuming
that
it
has
jurisdiction,
why
it
should
not
exercise
that
original
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
in
case
after
case,
after
case,
this
court
has
emphasized,
that
state
should
work
out
problems
relating
to
mutual
boundaries
or
interstate
stream
themselves,
if
they
can
do
it
and
in
case
after
case
it
was
only
after
such
attempts
that
reconciliation
between
the
states
had
failed
that
this
court
had
agreed
to
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction.
now,
here
what
do
we
have?
we
have
the
two
states
where
the
disputed
water
is
located,
agreeing
after
more
than
15
years
of
negotiations
on
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
waters
involved.
we
have
a
joint
task
force
that
the
government
participated
in
after
long
study
finally
agreeing
on
recommendations
which
as
is
already
been
noted,
have
already
begun
to
increase
the
water
procurement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
water
level
has
risen
some
11
and
12
feet
in
the
last
few
years,
ever
since
the
interior
department
has
begun
concentrating
on
their
operating
criteria
and
putting
them
in
one
shape.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
indians
originally
participated
in
the
taskforce,
withdrew,
then
submitted
statements
and
witnesses
in
regard
to
the
compact.
they
specifically
made
some
objections
to
the
compact
as
it
was
originally
drafted
and
those
objections
were
taken
into
consideration
and
this
is
quite
important,
let
me
give
you
two
examples.
originally,
the
california
was
given
an
unlimited
right
to
create
extra
--
to
create
extra
flow,
to
create
extra
water
after
the
original
tahoe
basin
was
taken
care
of.
the
indians
objected
to
that
and
a
10,000
acre
foot
limit
was
put
on
california's
right.
in
another
example
the
indians
were
given
a
maximum
right
based
on
orr
water
ditch
plus
municipal
and
other
use
which
was
actually
being
put
to
the
beneficial
use,
they
could
not
get
anymore
water
after
that.
that
was
eliminated
because
of
their
objection.
so
that
after
their
orr
water
ditch
commitment
now
and
after
california's
share
comes
out,
then
the
use
goes
back
to
nevada
again
and
the
indians
have
a
full
right
to
get
the
amount
of
money
--
the
amount
of
water
that
they
can
show
that
they
need
from
that.
these
are
two
examples
of
objections
which
the
indians
had
at
the
compact
and
which
were
taken
care
of
in
the
compact.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
the
compact
will
not
become
operative
until
congress
approves
it
and
we
think
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
been
intimately
involved
in
the
development
of
the
compact
that
the
--
and
in
view
of
further
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
nevada
is
also
concerned
about
the
indians
rights
and
making
sure
that
this
level
of
the
lake
is
at
certain
level.
we
think
that
they
should
be
presenting
their
arguments
to
congress
rather
than
here
in
view
of
this
long
history
of
negotiations
between
the
states
where
finally,
unlike
these
other
cases
where
you
had
where
the
states
have
been
unable
to
come
to
agreement,
we
have
been
unable
--
we
have
been
able
to
come
to
an
agreement
and
the
agreement
is
such
that
the
indians
could
not
possibly
be
damaged.
the
united
states
doesn't
claim
that
they
are
going
to
be
damaged
by
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
indians
obviously
would
much
prefer
a
declaration
by
this
court
that
they
have
a
winters
right
to
x
amount
of
the
water.
they
undoubtedly
would
prefer
that
to
the
compact.
on
the
other
hand,
our
position
is
that
if
the
compact
is
approved,
california's
share
is
so
small,
it's
a
maximum
45,000
acre
feet.
you
have
got
560
-
80,000
acre
feet
of
water
here
involved
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
harmed
by
california's
share.
you
are
going
to
have
plenty
of
water
coming
into
nevada
and
if
a
problem
arises
later,
then
the
indians
can
sue
at
the
appropriate
time
either
they
can
sue
in
nevada.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
they
would
not
be
suing
against
the
compact
mr.
justice
marshall
because
the
compact
would
leave
plenty
of
water
in
nevada
for
their
share.
you
understand
that
the
indians
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
sir,
i
beg
a
differ
what
if
a
fish,
the
united
states
has
told
the
judge,
it
could
sell
or
thrive
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
fish
is
thriving
today
because
of
great
improvement
in
the
level
of
pyramid
lake
and
another
things
which
are
taking
place
there
through
the
secretary
of
interior's
operating
criteria.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
undoubtedly
would
have
to
appoint
a
master.
if
you
accept
this
case,
let
me
tell
you
what's
going
to
happen.
first
of
all,
the
compact
is
going
to
come
to
a
halt.
congress
obviously
is
not
going
to
approve
the
compact
while
the
issue
is
now
pending
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
compacts
has
been
almost
17
years.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
number
two
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
you
were
to
take
an
extreme
case
where
so
much
water
was
given
to
california
that
in
effect
obliterated
the
indian's
rights,
i
think
that
there
would
be
authority
to
do
that
in
the
same
way
that
you
could
takeaway
a
man's
land
through
an
international
treaty
with
say
canada
or
mexico.
i
think
that
it
would
supersede,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
again
that
there
is
no
question
about
in
this
case
because
if
you
look
at
what
the
indians
are
asking,
when
they
say
winter's
right,
they
are
not
talking
about
some
esoteric
theory
where
this
court
says
winters
right
to
put
some
stamp
on.
they
are
asking
for
enough
water
to
maintain
the
lake
namely
385,000
acre
feet.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
winters
right,
yes
sir.
that
comes
from
the
winters
case
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
mr.
justice,
where
you
have
first
discussed
the
fact
that
there
was
an
implied
reservation
of
water
along
with
an
indian
reservation
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
let
me
show
you
exactly
how
it
would
work.
the
compact
is
approved.
at
that
point
california
takes
out
as
i
say
at
a
maximum
and
this
really
is
a
maximum
45,000
acre
feet.
so
you
now
have
over
300,000
acre
feet
flowing
into
nevada.
if,
thereafter,
the
indians
were
not
getting
their
sufficient
share,
in
view
of
your
ruling,
that
their
share
would
be
allocated
to
the
state,
they
would
then
sue
the
state
of
nevada
and
the
nevada
federal
district
court
to
get
their
portion
of
the
300,000
that
was
a
part
of
the
state's
use.
in
other
words,
they
would
sue
nevada
because
the
only
disagreement
would
be
between
the
indians
on
the
one
hand
and
the
amount
of
water
the
nevada
has
now
collected
on
the
other.
there
would
be
no
conflict
or
controversies
with
california.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
do,
although
i
am
not
going
to
take
the
time
to
argue
it
here.
we
do
claim
that
california
could
be
brought
into
the
state
of
nevada.
there
is
recent
case
by
the
california
supreme
court
called
hall
versus
university
of
nevada
which
we
say
supports
that
idea,
but
i
do
not
have
to
take
that
position
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
our
point
is
this
that
if
you
allow
congress
to
act,
now
what
has
happened
here.
the
compact
has
been
placed
in
the
congress.
their
appropriate
committees
have
been
asked
for
the
comments
of
the
united
states--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
negotiation
on
what
the
shares
were
going
to
be.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
no
no
no
it
is
only
been
before
congress
the
last
session
and
this
session
that
is
the
only
it
has
been
before
congress,
all
of
these
some
15
years
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
there
are
two
senators
which
have
made
statements
on
behalf
of
the
indians
in
california.
i
would
prefer
that
mr.
walston
speaking
for
california
address
himself
to
that,
but
i
do
not
think
obviously
that
is
going
to
control.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
would
hope
that
they
would
see
the
light
mr.
justice
and
particularly
after
you
do
not
allow
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
justice
if
you
take
this
case
i
can
assure
you
as
a
practical
matter
there
are
a
number
of
things
are
going
to
happen.
first
of
all
congress
is
going
to
stop
dead
in
its
tracks
in
trying
to
prove
the
contract.
secondly
the
various
recommendations
that
have
been
made
by
the
task
force
for
proving
the
lake
are
going
to
stop
because
nobody
is
going
to
know
how
much
water
has
to
go
to
the
indians.
the
interior
secretory
is
operating
criteria
which
he
is
now
under
order
to
improve
here
and
which
he
is
going
to
produce
still
more
water,
if
he
has
jurisdiction
to
do
it
for
pyramid
lake
are
going
to
come
a
complete
hall
again
because
nobody
is
going
to
know
what
we
are
talking
about
here
in
terms
of
these
winters
rights.
i
emphasize
to
you
that
a
winters
right
is
not
some
is
not
some
definite
specific
figure.
you
have
to
go
back
and
find
out
what
the
situation
was
in
1859
at
the
time
the
reservation
was
created,
what
the
indians
were
doing,
we
are
not
as
all
sure
as
the
solicitor
general
that
they
were
engaged
in
all
this
much
fisheries
for
example
and
we
have
to
go
through
that
entire
business.
orr
water
ditch
which
is
a
case
which
adjudicated
we
say
that
very
rights
that
are
under
consideration
here
took
i
think
it
was
something
like
20
years
for
them
to
come
to
any
conclusion.
now
orr
water
ditch
you
understand
already
gives
the
indians
30,000
acre
fit
a
year,
that
is
adjudicated.
and
we
say
that,
that
actually
covers
this
case
in
is
fully
determinative,
but
even
if
it
isn't,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
what
the
indians
want
they
are
either
getting
or
about
to
get.
they
want
385,000
acre
feet,
that
is
what
their
brief
says,
that
is
what
the
united
states
said,
because
385,000
acre
feet
is
going
to
sustain
that
lake
at
its
present
level,
that
is
what
they
want.
now
when
we
turn
to
that
what
do
we
find?
we
find
that
there
is
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
water
increasing
recently
into
pyramid
lake
because
of
the
changes
that
i
have
talked
about
and
we
also
have
these
specific
recommendations
of
the
task
force,
some
of
which
you
been
carried
out.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
one
of
the
things
the
task
forces
recommended
was
a
cloud
seeding
project.
well
that
sounds
a
little
far
out,
but
in
true
we
are
now
into
the
third
year
because
of
that
recommendation
of
the
cloud
seeding
project
and
they
found
in
the
first
two
years
that
there
was
a
14%
and
a
10%
increase
in
precipitation
as
a
result
of
that.
in
hard
cold
fact,
that
14%
produces
140,000
acre
fit
of
water,
a
120,000
of
which
goes
to
pyramid.
this
is
one
of
the
reason
why
pyramid,
we
think
is
started
back
up
again.
there
are
other
recommendations
that
the
taskforce
made.
they
said
for
example
if
you
enforce
your
present
decrees,
if
you
will
go
into
district
court
with
the
decrees
that
you
have
right
now
and
enforce
them
that
you
will
find,
and
they
gave
a
specific
figure
of
how
much
of
that
would
produce,
9500
acre
feet
there.
they
talked
about
certain
tcid
improvements,
the
truckee-carson
irrigation
district
improvements
which
would
produce
another
85,000
and
so
we
have
these
recommendations,
part
of
which
are
being
implemented
right
now
and
part
of
which
we
will
be,
if
the
court
does
not
take
things
over,
which
we
say
is
already
beginning
to
sustain
the
lake
and
would
certainly
will
sustain
the
lake
if
you
do
not
take
this
case
in
which
if
everybody
is
allowed
to
proceed.
for
example
if
you
do
not
take
this
case
and
i
might
say
we
think
that
united
states
is
suing
the
wrong
party,
we
think
here
they
ought
be
suing
themselves
because
judge
gesell
took
the
position
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
not
properly
carrying
out
his
responsibility
and
his
own
operating
criteria
and
we
say
that
if
you
combine
these
various
factors,
if
you
combine
the
compact,
if
you
combine
the
recommendations
that
have
been
made
some
of
which
you
have
already
been
carried
out,
if
you
add
into
that
judge
gesell's
order
about
improving
his
operating
criteria,
you
are
going
to
have
more
than
enough
water
for
pyramid
lake.
we
hope,
obviously
i
cannot
guarantee
that,
but
we
say
until
these
things
have
had
an
opportunity
to
show
themselves,
until
we
have
had
an
opportunity
and
good
faith
to
carry
out
what's
going
on
here,
why
should
we
stop
the
whole
thing
right
now
after
the
17
years,
bring
it
all
to
a
halt
and
suddenly
have
this
court
appoint
a
special
master
and
go
back
and
begin
determining
for
i
do
not
know
how
many
additional
years
what
the
winters
rights
says.
if
there
was
a
question
about
what
they
really
wanted
from
these
winters
rights,
i
would
take
a
different
position,
but
there
is
no
question
they
want
385,000
acre
feet.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
it's
--
in
the
first
place
in
united
states
is
not
responded
to
congress'
request
for
comments,
i
am
sure
because
of
this
case
and
won't
until
there
is
some
decision
here,
that
is
number
one.
number
two,
there
are
projects
which
have
been
recommended
by
the
taskforce
which
require
money
and
obviously
i
do
not
think
the
state
can
be
expected
to
commit
any
funds,
if
we
are
willing
to,
with
not
knowing
what
the
indians
were
eventually
going
to
get
and
also
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question,
but
that
judge
gesell's
order
be
ignored
in
affect
in
ignorance
of
this
court
were
to
take
jurisdiction
because
obviously
a
ruling
here
would
in
affect
override
much
of
what
he
has
done.
so
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
practical
affect
would
be.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir
it
is
a
s.
24
and
h.
r.
15
at
the
moment.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
nevada
there
is
a
room
full
of
records
relating
to
orr
water
ditch.
perfectly
true
he
could
go
through
them
but
it
has
got
a
long
hard
difficult
task
ahead
of
him
and
i
do
not
want
to
mislead
you
for
a
moment
that
this
is
a
question
of
sitting
down
and
reading
to
a
few
papers
and
coming
to
a
conclusion.
everybody
who
dealt
with
this
problem
has
found
it
extraordinarily
difficult,
it
has
taken
an
awful
long
time.
may
i
just
end
by
quoting
to
you
something
that
was
said
just
last
year
by
the
national
water
commission
that
was
appointed
by
the
president.
it
said
the
future
utilization
of
indian
rights
on
fully
appropriated
streams
will
divest
prior
uses
initiated
under
state
law
and
curiously
enough
often
financed
with
federal
funds
and
will
impose
economic
hardship
amounting
to
disaster
in
some
cases
on
users
with
large
investments
made
over
long
period
of
time.
that
is
the
reason
that
the
state
of
nevada
is
concerned
because
obviously
we
have
an
interest
in
the
indians
in
preserving
the
some
400
indians,
but
we
are
also
terribly
concerned
about
the
water
that
goes
in
the
newlands
and
irrigates
some
64,000
acres
of
land.
we
are
concerned
about
the
quarter
of
million
people
in
the
area
who
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
sir
when
you
get
the
wildlife
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh
no
sir,
you
mean
newlands
used
ducks?
no
sir
newlands,
the
stow
off
from
newlands
helps
the
still
water
a
wildlife
refuge,
but
you
have
got
64,000
acres
of
land
out
there
under
irrigation
sir.
you
have
got
5000
farmers
you
have
a
quarter
of
million
people
in
the
area
who
are
depending
upon
the
water
from
the
truckee.
we
are
not
talking
about
protecting
ducks.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
but
it
spill
off
sir
its
what
left
over
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
cannot
give
you
the
actual
percentage
but
i
tell
you
it
is
not
the
original
use
at
all
sir.
the
it's
the
runoff
that
goes
down
to
still
water,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
that
is
the
reason
for
our
concern
here
that
yes
there
are
the
indians
interest
and
obviously
they
have
some
rights.
we're
not
trying
to
do
away
with
those
rights.
we
did
in
the
compact
as
united
states
agreed,
but
there
is
also
the
interest
of
an
awful
lot
of
other
people
here
that
we
want
to
make
sure
are
also
protected.
we
think
we
are
in
good
faith
after
these
negotiations.
there
is
tremendous
amount
of
it
--
$1.50
million
dollars
spent
on
getting
this
compact.
we
think
we
are
entitled
now
to
proceed
and
if
by
any
chance,
it
doesn't
work,
if
the
light
goes
down
again,
they
can
come
back,
light
can
come
back
very
much.
