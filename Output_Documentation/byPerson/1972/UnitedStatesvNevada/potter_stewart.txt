the
constitution
provides
the
interstate
compacts,
it
doesn't
provide
to
best
of
my
knowledge
between
--
for
compacts
between
the
states
and
united
states.
i
suppose
your
point
is
that
congress
would
not
approve
and
it
has
to
do
under
the
constitution
of
an
interstate
compact
if
it
wasn't
satisfactory
to
united
states
but
suppose
the
response
to
that
would
be
well
in
this
case,
it
is
not
the
congress
that
is
the
guardian
of
the
indian
wards
but
it
is
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
that's
the
guardian
and
we
can't
leave
this
matter
to
the
self
interest,
if
you
will,
of
states
like
california
and
nevada,
that
are
represented
in
the
congress
by
senators
and
representatives
representing
those
states,
but
rather
it's
the
executive
branch
and
there
is
no
room
on
account
of
constitution
at
least
for
a
compact
among
states
and
the
executive
branch
of
the
government?
justice

stewart

rights
basically.
justice

stewart
the
compact
is
in
a
judicatory
committee,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
go
to
the
committee
the
--
the
committees
of
both
houses?
justice
potter
stewart

different
groups
within
the
department
of
interior,

about,
