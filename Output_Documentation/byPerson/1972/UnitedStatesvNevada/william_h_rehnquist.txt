mr.
solicitor
general,
does
your
complaint
show
what
the
annual
flow
in
acre
feet
was
before
the
newlands
diversion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
hold
up
that
map,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
think
none
of
the
four
of
us
have
the
green
one?
or
is
it
upside
down?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
i
gather
from
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas's
question
that
the
government
doesn't
really
seriously
press
the
idea
that
the
case
ought
to
be
partially
adjudicated
here
before
it's
referred
to
a
master?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
approves
the
compact
that's
inconsistent
with
some
indian
claim,
i
would
take
at
the
congressional
action
would
supersede
whatever
indian
claim
might
have
existed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
typical
with
any
irrigation,
doesn't
it,
that
you
get
a
certain
amount
of
run
off?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
not
permitted
any
diversions
for
the
newlands
project?
justice
william

rehnquist
of

judge
gesell
was
limited,
wasn't
he,
in
that
he
didn't
have
the
water
users
before
him
so
that
that
was
really
the
only
approach
he
could
take?
justice

but
that
was
initiated
by
the

mr.
solicitor

arizona
and
california
asserted
claims

patriae.
here
you
are
insisting
that
they
assert
them
even
though
they
are
defendant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
all
these
farmers
would
loose
their
rights
as
a
result
of
that
adjudication
if
it
were
favorable
to
the
indians
without
ever
having
had
a
day
in
