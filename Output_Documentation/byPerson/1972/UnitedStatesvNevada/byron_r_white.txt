justice

white
but
you
do
not
suggest
that
there
is
any
other
court
right
now
in
which
a
suit
could
be
filed
and
would
settle
this
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
took
a
more
persuasive
one
as
away
from
the
two
wait
on
the
compact
and
then
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
prettyman
planning
the
case
would
necessarily
keep
parties
to
the
case,
including
the
united
states
from
settling
it,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
filing
of
this
motion
for
leave
to
file
interrupted
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
--
assuming
that
nothing
that
judge
gesell
ordered
would
be
interrupted
by
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit,
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
might
turn
out
to
be
an
unnecessary
act
but
it
would
not
--
it
would
be
very
bothersome,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
in
terms
of
whether
the
water
would
be
available
or
not,
if
judge
gesell's
orders
were
carried
out
as
you
say
they
could
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
understand
the
attorney
solicitor
general
to
say
that's
what
they
were
demanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
solution
of
the
problem
is
that
so,
and
i
would
not
say
that
they
are
simple
but
if
you
think
judge
gesell
has
seized
upon
adequate
solution,
it
should
not
be
very
difficult,
it
would
not
take
if
you
are
right,
for
even
if
this
suit
was
filed,
you
mean
even
to
arrive
a
similar
result
here
or
to
dismiss
it
and
leave
it
to
judge
gesell's
decree.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
--
i
suppose
you
have
taken
cases
in
which
we
specifically
said
that
we
did
not
intend
to
interrupt
a
lot
of
other
things
going
under
the
court
in
the
same
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
we
are
going
to
say
the
fellow
who
is
under
judge
gesell's
order
wants
another
solution
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
the
one
who
is
under
order,
judge
gesell's
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
the
one
who
recommended
the
filing
this
lawsuit,
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
they
be
brought
in
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
say
that
the
admission
of
montana
did
not
supersede
an
implied
reservation
of
water
when
the
reservation
was
created
just
a
year
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
district
court
–
a
federal
court
or
even
a
state
court
would
have
jurisdiction
over
--
in
a
state
water
adjudication
if
united
states
was
noticed
as
to
what
its

rights
might

might

you
would
have
to
enter
that
to
--
justice
byron

yes.
justice
byron

white
well,
with
respect
to
the
competing
claims
of
newlands
and
pyramid
lake,
these
are
intrastate
stream.
