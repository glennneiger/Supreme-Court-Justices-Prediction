mr.
rocovich
we
have
had
the
income
tax
now
for
almost
60
years.
unknown
speaker
income
tax.
why
do
you
think
issues
like
this
are
coming
up
in
1972
rather
than
1923
or
1933
or
1943
or
1953?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
it
ever
been
really
judicially
determined
here
anyway
that
miranda
warnings
have
to
be
given?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
a
separate
part
of
the
irs?
unknown
speaker
and
you
specifically
denied
a
certiorari
along
with
the
test
back
in
the
circuits.
unknown
speaker
are
there
several
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
was
addressing
myself
really
was
to
here
as
i
understand
it
there
wasn't
recommendation
for
prosecution
at
the
time
this
summon
was
issued.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
in
that
circumstance
were
there
any
fifth
amendment
or
other
problems
in
the
light
of
donaldson?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
the
fact
that
--
as
i
understand
it,
when
this
summon
was
issued
there
had
neither
been
--
certainly
there
wasn't
any
recommendation
made
nor
any
determination
that
any
recommendation
would
be
made.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
did
donaldson
answer
that
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
left
it
open.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
the
agent
that
carried
out
the
initial
orders
asked
for
these
papers
to
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
constitutionally
he
could
require
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
even
though
they
might
obtain
incriminating
evidence
and
even
though
they
might
be
in
the
taxpayer's
handwriting.
unknown
speaker
and
now
that
i
have
got
the
key
to
your
argument
is
just
as
soon
as
they
suspected
for
it,
however
reasonable
may
have
been
the
basis
for
the
suspicion,
just
as
soon
as
they
brought
in
that
element
of
irs
and
then
everything
followed
that
you
are
ought
to
be
following.
unknown
speaker
it's
the
whole
tax
system
is
so
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
dictum.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wallace,
suppose
this
were
after
recommendation
of
prosecution,
you
would
still
take
the
same
position,
if
the
summon
is
issued
after
a
recommendation?
unknown
speaker
just
because
the
papers
are
in
the
possession
of
the
accountant.
unknown
speaker
and
as
a
rule
recommendation
or
not
has
no
relevance.
whether
there
has
been
a
recommendation
or
not
--
unknown
speaker
any
kind
of
irs
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
but
what
he
is
being
asked
by
summons
to
produce
them
himself.
as
i
understand
it
if
he
asserts
the
privilege
that's
respected
right?
unknown
speaker
you
just
mentioned
boyd
in
your
brief,
as
i
recall
you
stated
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
boyd
because
the
taxpayer
here
did
not
have
possession
of
the
records
--
unknown
speaker
talk
a
little
about
where
you
draw
the
line
on
this
issue
of
possession.
the
cases
that
come
to
mind
and
some
of
them
have
been
mentioned
here
today
already,
suppose
when
secretary
had
the
records,
suppose
when
had
an
accountant
in
his
office
who
had
had
the
records,
suppose
when
he
had
an
employee
or
here
we
have
an
independent
contractor.
where
do
you
suggest
the
line
should
be
drawn?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
location
primarily
or
the
power
to
control
an
employee?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
how
the
government
views
the
accountant
here,
was
he
an
independent
contractor
in
your
estimation?
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
whether
he
is,
or
he
is
merely
an
employee?
unknown
speaker
so
it
states
that
the
petitioner
could
have
had
no
reasonable
expectations
that
these
documents
would
have
been
kept
private.
i
assume
you
must
be
and
only
with
respect
to
the
government
you
are
saying
that
--
do
not
suggest
that
the
accountant
would
be
free
to
show
them
to
friends
and
neighbors.
do
you?
unknown
speaker
would
this
case
be
different
mr.
wallace
if
rather
than
an
accountant?
all
the
other
facts
precisely
the
same
if
this
had
been
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
in
that
former
situation
there
isn't
with
any
court?
unknown
speaker
and
do
they
support
the
position
that
you
just
--?
unknown
speaker
the
constitutional
issue
would
be
the
same
though
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rocovich
we
have
had
the
income
tax
now
for
almost
