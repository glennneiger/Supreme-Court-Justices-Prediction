what
about
the
taxpayer's
working
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rocovich,
may
i
ask
you,
have
you
yet
addressed
yourself
to
why
donaldson
doesn't
pretty
much
answer
the
questions
presented
by
this
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rocovich
certainly
your
possession
would
carry
you
a
step
beyond
donaldson,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
the
other
point
in
donaldson,
i
thought
that
something
was
said
about
the
recommendation
of
prosecution
as
a
dividing
point
and
certainly,
do
i
not
understand
you
to
say
here
that
this
case
had
not
reached
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
the
special
agent
showed
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
many
times
when
the
special
agent
shows
up,
there
never
is
any
recommendation
for
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
role
of
the
taxpayer?
the
taxpayer
has
the
records
in
there
and
(inaudible)
and
the
fifth
amendment
pointed
that,
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
that
if
the
taxpayer
had
an
employee
that
came
to
his
office
worked
all
day
and
then
particularly
--
records
pulled
at
night
or
around
the
weekend
and
the
government
just
has
to
subpoena
the
records
from
the
hands
of
the
employee
while
he
hasn't,
what's
your
concern?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
suggesting
that
it
might
be
difficult
for
the
government
if
the
person
was
acting
against
the
nation?
