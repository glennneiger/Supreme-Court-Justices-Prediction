would
probably

made
in

justice
lewis
f.
powell,

but
your
position,
does
it
depend
on
whether
it's
made
in
her
personal
hand,
for
her
own
use?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

what
about
if
an
employee
has
made
a
fault,
what
about
invoices
sent
to
her
from
sources?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

how
about
seizing
them
from
her?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

how
about
bills
that
she
sent
out
to
her
customers.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

so
they
could
seize
those
from
her?
justice
lewis

so
what

do
you
say
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
from
seizure
from
her?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

but
anyways
if
you
figure
those
out
from
the
other
documents
that
you
say
could
be
seized?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

couldn't
you
seize
if
the
waitress
gives
a
check
to
somebody
in
the
restaurant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
she
presents
that
to
the
cashier,
the
cashier
puts
it
somewhere
--
i
suppose
you
would
say,
you
could
seize
that,
wouldn't
you?
