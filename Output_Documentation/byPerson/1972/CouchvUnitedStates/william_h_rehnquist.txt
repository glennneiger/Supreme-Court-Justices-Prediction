justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rocovich,
does
the
record
show
whether
these
records
were
of
a
nature
that
the
taxpayer
would
turn
them
over
to
her
accountant
say
for
a
few
days
each
year
and
then
get
them
back
or
whether
on
the
other
hand
they
were
more
or
less
permanently
in
the
custody
of
her
accountant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
year
in
year
out
custody
or
possession
of
records,
does
the
record
of
this
proceeding
indicated
who
had
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
say
is
the
leading
case
from
this
court
that
supports
your
answer
to
justice
white's
question
that
there
is
a
class
of
records
which
can
not
be
subpoenaed
from
the
taxpayer?
put
one
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
case
didn't
--
that
wasn't
a
holding,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
any
holdings
of
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
that
there
is
a
class
of
documents
that
cannot
be
subpoenaed
from
the
taxpayer
in
a
tax
situation
like
this,
if
she
raises
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
case
is
so
much
stronger
for
you
than
donaldson,
i
would
take
it
in
view
of
the
fact
that
donaldson,
it
was
the
circus's
record
that
was
subpoenaed
and
then
the
circus
was
perfectly
willing
to
give
them.
whereas,
here
it’s
claimed
at
least
that
it’s
your
clients
records
and
neither
she
nor
her
accountant
are
willing.
