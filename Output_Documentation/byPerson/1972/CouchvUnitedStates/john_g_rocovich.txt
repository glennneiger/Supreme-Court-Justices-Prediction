mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
surrounding
this
case
are
both
clear
and
undisputed.
during
the
summer
of
1969,
a
field
revenue
agent
commenced
an
investigation
of
the
returns
of
the
petitioner
for
the
years
1964
through
1968.
petitioner
informed
him
that
her
records
were
temporarily
in
the
possession
of
her
accountant,
whereupon
the
field
agent
proceeded
to
the
accountant's
office
for
the
records
and
made
available
for
his
examination.
now
the
records
in
question
were
primarily
canceled
checks
and
working
papers
which
were
made
by
the
petitioner
in
her
own
handwriting
for
purposes
of
keeping
records
for
her
sole
proprietorship
restaurant.
the
field
agent
examined
the
records
for
several
days.
during
the
course
of
his
examination
he
apparently
suspected
that
criminal
fraud
was
involved
and
he
requested
and
received
the
assignment
of
a
special
revenue
agent.
the
trial
court
found
as
matter
of
fact
that
the
special
agent
in
his
capacity
as
such
was
conducting
a
joint
investigation
with
the
field
revenue
agent
for
the
purposes
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
the
income
tax
return,
plus
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
there
was
any
criminal
tax
fraud
in
the
case.
the
special
agent,
once
he
came
to
the
case,
proceeded
to
the
accountant's
offices,
observed
the
petitioner's
records,
and
thereupon
went
to
the
petitioner's
house
where
he
introduced
himself,
showed
his
credentials
and
gave
a
standard
miranda
warning
which
included
a
statement
that
she
did
not
have
to
produce
any
information
and
she
was
entitled
to
seek
a
lawyer's
counsel
before
she
responded
to
any
questions.
and
the
special
agent
proceeded
to
question
the
petitioner
and
then
proceeded
to
the
petitioner's
accountant's
office
to
seize
or
copy
the
records.
in
the
meantime,
petitioner
heeded
the
special
agent's
advice
and
had
contacted
her
accountant
and
lawyer,
and
advised
the
accountant
to
turn
the
records
over
to
no
one
but
her
attorney.
when
the
special
agent
arrived
at
the
accountant's
office,
the
accountant
refused
to
turnover
the
records.
the
special
agent
at
that
point
issued
a
summons
to
the
accountant
directing
him
to
turn
the
records
over.
from
the
special
agent's
return
to
the
accountant's
office
on
the
return
date,
he
discovered
that
the
accountant
had
already
turned
the
records
over
to
me
as
the
petitioner's
attorney.
the
government
then
instituted
a
proceeding
to
judicially
enforce
the
summons
under
7402(a)
and
7604(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
action
arises
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
virginia
affirmed
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
directing
me
to
turnover
the
books
and
records
in
question.
the
central
question
we
believe
in
this
case
is,
whether
or
not
the
privileges
against
self-incrimination
and
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
prevents
the
government
from
seizing
petitioner's
personal
books
and
records
whenever
they
are
out
of
her
actual
physical
possession.
by
way
of
background
i
think
the
government
has
never
denied
that
the
records
in
the
hands
of
the
accountant
were
the
property
of
the
petitioner.
in
fact
in
their
brief
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
they
conceded
that
the
records
in
question
had
they
been
in
the
hands
of
petitioner
would
have
been
protected
by
the
privilege.
thus
the
question
becomes
i
think
whether
records
created
and
owned
by
the
petitioner
somehow
lose
their
privileged
status
when
they
are
out
of
a
actual
physical
possession.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
i
believe
the
accountant
testified
that
the
records
had
been
delivered
to
him
over
a
period
of
years,
55
on
to
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
tax
returns.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
records
were
at
the
petitioner's
home
and
some
records
were
at
the
accountant's
office
and
she
delivered
the
balance
of
the
records
to
the
accountant
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
sub-investigation.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
records
were
owned
by
the
accountant.
in
fact,
the
petitioner
has
always
asserted
through
the
proceedings
below
that
they
were
clearly
her
records
and
owned
by
her
and
the
government
has
conceded
it.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
does
indicate
that
in
complete,
no
sir.
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
test
of
whether
she
may
rely
on
the
fifth
and
fourth
amendment
privileges
is
whether
she
possesses
substantial
instance
of
ownership
in
the
records.
and
we
submit
that
this
test
of
course,
would
be
subject
to
the
condition
at
where
a
taxpayer
voluntarily
and
knowingly
and
intentionally
published
the
records
then
they
would
lose
this
privilege.
in
essence,
i
believe
the
test
is
from
what
source
did
the
records
originate.
if
they
originated
with
the
petitioner,
they
should
be
protected.
if
they
did
not
then
they
should
not.
the
government
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
i
am.
the
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
are
a
series
of
cases
which
state
that
possession
is
not
the
test,
it
is
ownership
and
as
long
as
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
demand
or
the
taxpayer
had
the
right
to
demand
the
records
back,
that
possession
was
not
the
key
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
privileged.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no
we
do
not
assert
an
accountant-client
privilege,
we
will
concede
there
is
none.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
actually
either
agent
or
bailee,
since
regarded
an
agent
for
the
specific
purpose--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
he
was
actually
just
compensated
by
the
job.
i
think,
he
prepared
the
petitioner's
tax
returns
every
year
and
maybe
the
withholding
trust
fund
tax
deposit
forms.
he
actually
did
very
little
work
for
the
petitioner
but
this
was
his
function
with
her,
he
is
not
a
certified
public
accountant
but
more
in
the
line
of
a
bookkeeper
type.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
this
was
his
full-time
job.
he
had
been
doing
this
for
20
years
or
so.
i
think
the
importance
--
so
we
believe
that
the
ruling
question
that
we
submit
is
the
really
only
practical
and
workable
rule
which
this
court
that
can
adopt.
if
that
is
not
the
rule
and
if
the
government's
test
is
adopted,
i
think
the
alternatives
aren't
satisfactory.
we
could
return
to
the
case
of
burdeau
v.
mcdowell
by
this
court,
i
think
in
1921,
where
records
were
turned
over
to
prosecutor
which
had
been
obtained
by
a
party
breaking
into
a
man's
office,
blasting
the
safe
up
with
a
part
of
dynamite,
smashing
his
desk
on
axe
and
turning
the
records
over
to
prosecutor.
certainly
that
type
of
evidence
should
not
be
permitted.
they
introduced
in
the
evidence
that
we
agree
with
the
dissent
of
justice's
holmes
and
brandeis
and
they
said,
“what
could
be
more
shocking
to
our
sense
of
decency
and
fair
play
than
that?”
actually
the
court's
decision
did
not
go
off
on
the
point
of
possession
or
ownership,
they
merely
said,
this
court
merely
said,
“well
it
was
obtained
by
government
compulsion
so
it
must
be
okay.”
but
i
think
the
dissent,
there
has
to
be
the
proper
rule
in
that
case.
another
alternative
from
a
practical
and
policy
standpoint
is,
what
is
an
informed
tax
attorney
to
advice
to
his
accounting
firm
clients
if
the
government's
test
is
adopted.
he
advised
them
to
lease
their
file
storage
room
to
all
of
their
clients,
so
that
even
though
they
are
working
on
their
personal
handmade
records,
there
will
be
some
kind
of
constructive
possession
theory
that
they
rely
on
to
prevent
waiving
their
privileges.
i
don't
know
what
else
an
informed
attorney
could
advice
and
what
about
for
instance,
your
particular
taxpayer
class.
you
advise
them
to
only
permit
their
accountant
to
work
on
their
personal
records
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
home
and
in
the
same
room
with
them,
with
door
bolted,
preventing
internal
revenue
agent
from
intruding
with
the
summons
and
grasping
whatever
record
might
happen
to
be
in
the
accountant's
hand
at
that
moment.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
these
are
sales
records
made
in
his
personal
hand
and
the
government
however
has
conceded
that
these
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
these
were
made
in
her
personal
handwriting
for
her
sole
proprietorship
restaurant.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no
she
could
have
typed
it
or
something
of
that
nature
or
i
suggest
the
same
would
prevail
if
her
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well
the
government
can
obtain
those
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
we
would
concede
that
they
could
seize
them
but
those
are
not
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no,
she
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
this
case
as
an
example
we
had
the
gross
daily
receipt
worksheet
where
she
noted
each
one
of
her
three
shifts
at
the
restaurant.
she
took
that
to
cash
register.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
so
because
in
this
case
the
--
she
doesn't
really
sent
any
bills,
it's
a
cash
business,
a
cash
register
at
the
restaurant.
we
don't
believe
that
the
government's
test
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
i
think
you
could.
i
don't
have
any
--
part
of
that,
all
of
that's
actually
owned
by
the
restaurant.
the
customer
just
has
in
his
hand
to
notify
him
what
he
is
supposed
to
pay
and
returns
immediately
to
the
restaurant
owner
with
his
check.
but
we
don't
have
any
difficulty
seizing
that
either
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
think
the
reason
is
that
the
miranda
case
is
that,
the
miranda
case
in
escobedo
did
not
come
up
until
the
mid
60s
and
that
started
this
whole
chain
of
cases
when
taxpayers
discovered
they
had
rights
that
they
never
realized
they
had
before.
and
there
are
many
cases
starting
immediately
after
miranda,
there
is
a
long
string
of
these
cases.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well
this
court
has
a
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
in
the
matter
of
this
case,
this
court
went
so
far
to
say
that
tax
prosecution
were
not
immune
from
miranda
decision
and
the
case
you
decided,
the
donaldson
case,
i
believe,
two
years
ago,
you
specifically
stated
that
the
court
was
not
deciding
on
this
question.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
and
lawfully
we
have
the
weight
of
the
circuits,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
am
hard
pressed
to
think
of
just
one
case
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
i
think
all
the
cases
such
as
reisman
v.
caplin
for
instance
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
there
was
a
strong
inference
that
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
holdings
on
what
documents
are
privileged
and
what
aren't?
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
can't
--
we
are
going
back
to
boyd
v.
united
states
in
1886,
where
a
man
had
prepared
his
own
records
and
invoices.
they
said
that
this
class,
this
court
stated
that
this
class
of
documents
in
general
could
not
be
seized
in
the
possession
of
the
taxpayer
and
that
was
followed
by
counselman
v.
hitchcock,
and
cited
hundreds
of
times
since,
so
i
think
that's
the
place
to
start
your
honor,
it's
boyd
v.
untied
states
in
1886.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
we
don't
contest
the
admission
of
tax
returns.
they
have
been
given
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
all
of
this
is
on
schedules.
the
tax
returns
also
should
be
admissible.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
in
accounts,
working
papers
i
think
are
admissible
too.
i
think
---
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
think
the
records
prepared
about
taxpayer
for
purpose
of
making
his
return
should
be
privileged.
because
they
are
prepared
by
him
for
his
own
benefit
in
his
own
hand
and
they
are
not
part
of
the
tax
return.
those
are
personal
records.
the
government
goes
so
far
as
to
contend
and
i
believe
with
their
theory
if
any
time
it's
out
of
your
physical
possession
it
is
subject
to
subpoena.
justice
white,
if
i
were
helping
you
across
constitution
avenue
by
carrying
your
briefcase,
the
government
holds
that
they
could
hand
you
a
summons
in
the
middle
–
hand
me
a
summons
in
the
middle
of
constitution
avenue
and
seize
your
documents
to
use
against
you
in
a
criminal
trial.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
the
law
and
i
tend
to
agree
with
justice
holmes
and
brandeis,
it's
certainly
shocking
to
our
sense
of
fair
play.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well
the
canceled
checks
can
be
secured
from
the
bank.
i
would
feel
that
the
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
the
bank
keeps
a
copy
of
them.
most
banks
keep
copies
of
all
the
checks
that
they
clear.
that's
the
normal
method
of
preparing
a
networth
case
in
tax
court.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
would
–
although
the
government
has
been
so
kind
as
to
concede
that
that
would
be
privileged
i
would
doubt
that
a
canceled
check
could
be,
would
be
privileged.
what
we
are
talking
about
a
personal
payroll
records,
personal
worksheets
of
receipts
and
expenditure
and
things
of
that
nature
made
by
the
proprietor
for
her
own
purposes.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
i
think
when
you
get
into
wage
hour
cases
and
office
of
the
price
administration
cases
or
persons
where
the
records
are
specifically
required
to
be
kept
by
law
for
the
benefit
of
an
agency
or
a
tax
payer
enters
into
a
contract
with
the
government
to
provide
the
goods,
where
he
is
--
the
records
he
is
keeping
are
essentially
public
records
to
start
with
and
differ
substantially
from
these
records
that
are
used
to
prepare
the
tax
return.
another
policy
consideration
i
think
that
demands
attention
is
the
fact
that
i
believe
and
i
think
it
was
noted
in
the
stuart
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
internal
revenue
service
will
have
an
increasingly
difficult
time
enforcing
revenue
laws
if
the
government's
test
is
adopted.
the
congress
has
legislated
the
internal
revenue
court
appointed
it's
brilliant
comprehensible
to
the
average
person
and
even
to
the
average
attorney
and
most
taxpayers
today,
i
think,
find
it
necessary
to
enlist
the
aid
of
experts
such
as
accountants
and
tax
consultants
to
assist
them
in
the
preparation
of
their
returns.
i
submit
that
the
taxpayers
do
this
not
intending
to
give
up
either
ownership
or
privileges
under
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
in
the
donaldson
case
we
had
a
situation
where
the
government
was
subpoenaing,
he
was
given
the
summons
rather
to,
i
believe,
as
a
corporate
employer
for
the
corporate
employer's
records.
we
have
the
case
of
a
former
employee
coming
in
and
saying,
well
i
want
to
suppress
that
because
it
incriminates.
in
that
case
the
ownership
of
the
records
---
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
in
the
couch
--
in
the
case
before
the
court?
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
special
agent
was
just
coming
in
to
investigate.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
the
problem
comes,
if
a
person
prepared
documents
which
could
likely
contain
incriminating
evidence.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
that's
right
but
as
the
special
agent
testified
on
the
trial,
his
principal
purpose
of
his
job
is
to
ascertain
criminal
tax
fraud
and
the
purpose
i
think
in
the
miranda
case,
i
think,
that
the
point
is
reached
when
i
say
when
the
focal
point
of
the
investigation
changes
from
a
civil
rather
to
a
criminal
investigation,
at
that
point
the
defendants
and
the
have
the
right
to
exercise
it
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no
donaldson
specifically
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
specifically
--
well
the
efforts
in
donaldson
is
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
i
thank
they
stated
it,
this
do
not
have
to
do
with
records
whereas
the
taxpayers
had
no
proprietary
interest
of
any
kind,
which
were
owned
by
the
third
person
or
in
his
hands
and
which
relate
to
his
business
transactions
and
may
cite
it
with
approval
reisman
v.
caplin
in
which
case,
they
said
that
the
court
had
deemed
the
possession
to
be
the
same
as
if
they
were
in
the
possession
of
the
taxpayer
himself.
i
think,
the
inference
of
donaldson
favors
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes,
we
cooperated
and
delivered
the
papers.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir,
that’s
correct
for
civil
purposes,
but
at
the
point
where
his
investigation
shifts
to
a
criminal
one,
at
the
point
he
suspects
fraud,
at
that
point,
we
contend
he
must
warn
the
taxpayer
for
rights
and
at
that
point
he
loses
his
right
to
see
those
records.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
ownership
i
believe
was
at
test
in
donaldson,
the
government
is
going
after
the
corporation
with
their
records.
the
taxpayer
had
no
rights
whatsoever
to
those
records,
his
only
connection
was
they
were
incriminated.
here
in
our
record,
we
own
them
and
they
are
in
the
hands
of
our
agent
with
the
right
to
getting
back
immediately.
it’s
our
content
with
the
mere
naked
possession
by
one’s
agent
does
not
wave
the
rights
and
question.
that’s
the
basis
of
the
rule
we
suggest
to
this
court.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
and
that’s
the
--
there
are
many
cases
prior
to
the
issuance
of
revenue
ruling,
ir
949
i
think
it
is,
this
is
the
government
procedure.
there
are
many
cases
and
finally
adopted
the
procedure
that
once
they
suspect
fraud,
the
special
agent
will
be
brought
in,
it
will
give
them
miranda
warning.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
when
the
special
agent
was
brought
in,
his
first
act
was
to
proceed
to
the
taxpayer’s
home
and
give
this
miranda
warning.
we
can
see
that
they
did
this
properly.
we
can
see
that
after
we
had
gotten
a
warning,
we
would
be
entitled
to
heed
it
however
and
direct
our
agent
who
is
a
mere
naked
possessor
or
a
bailee
could
refuse
to
turn
it
over.
the
most
recent
case
which
has
come
up,
since
our
brief
and
is
noted
in
our
supplemental
brief
is
the
district
court
opinion
of
u.s
v.
sakuno
&
eto(ph)
which
is
identical
to
the
facts
of
the
series
of
cases
we
cite
in
our
favor
where
the
records
under
possession
of
the
accountant
and
they
belonged
to
the
taxpayer
and
the
government
handed
a
summons
to
the
accountant
and
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
in
couch
and
the
several
other
opinions
and
relying
heavily
on
the
donaldson
case
and
reisman
versus
caplin
found
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
in
that
case
who
said
the
government
could
not
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
but
he
was
not
a
salaried
employee,
as
opposed
to
common
law
employee
versus
independent
contractor,
he
was
an
independent
contractor,
yes
sir,
over
long
period
of
years.
i
think,
for
a
moment
it
might
be
worthwhile
examining
the
three
cases
the
government
relies
on.
i
mentioned
the
burdeau
v.
mcdowell
case
where
a
man
used
dynamite
and
hatchet
to
obtain
the
evidence,
i
think
that
clearly
cannot
be
the
law
any
longer,
they
also
rely
on
the
perlman
case
and
the
johnson
case.
mr.
johnson
took
bankruptcy
and
conveyed
his
records
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
this
was
a
voluntary
act,
he
transferred
ownership
and
he
transferred
possession
and
he
published
his
records
by
making
it
a
matter
of
public
record
with
the
court.
so
this
case
is
not
related
to
the
one
before
the
court
and
neither
is
the
case
entitled
perlman
v.
the
united
states
where
we
had
a
man
who
invented
a
pneumatic
wheel
and
obtained
a
patent
and
he
was
himself
in
a
patent
litigation,
he
introduced
the
wheel
and
exhibits
and
diagrams
and
documents
and
there
he
conveyed
title
to
the
equity
court,
he
conveyed
possessions
to
the
equity
court,
he
published
the
records.
so
i
think
that
court
is,
that
case
is
not
in
point,
he
was
subsequently
prosecuted
for
perjury
and
he
tried
to
suppress
this
information
but
since
you
have
transfer
of
possession
and
ownership
and
publication,
i
don’t
--
those
cases
seem
to
me
to
be
correct
but
not
in
point
to
the
case
before
us.
we
believe
that
the
government
has
not
cited
any
public
policy
reason
or
accepted
a
case
law
for
their
conclusion
that
possession
is
the
test
of
the
whether
you
waive
the
fifth
and
fourth
amendment
privileges.
on
the
contrary,
we
suggest
that
the
policy
reasons
which
i
have
cited
plus
the
numerous
cases
citing
the
brief,
which
don't
bear
going
into
at
this
time,
should
be
the
basis
of
adopting
our
test
of
ownership
as
being
the
key
rather
than
the
location
or
possession.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
above.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
think
donaldson
was
purely
the
case
of
--
in
donaldson,
you've
said,
as
i
recall,
that
ownership
was
the
test,
but
since
the
corporation
owned
the
records
that
a
former
employee
had
no
rights
to
them
in
the
them,
and
since
ownership
was
the
test,
that
he
could
not
suppress
the
evidence.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no,
this
case
had
already
reached
the
point
where
the
criminal
fraud
investigator
entered
the
picture
and
gave
the
warning,
there
had
been
no
recommendation
to
prosecute.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
i
recall
the
statistics
prepared
by
professor
charles
blaine(ph)
that
roughly
90%
of
all
convictions
obtained
by
the
justice
department
obtained
are
on
the
self-incrimination
of
the
taxpayer.
there
are
many
that
are
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
and
contend
that
the
rights
and
questions
are
personal,
the
human
civil
type
rights
to
protect
one's
documents
and
the
compulsion,
directed
against
one's
agent
who
is
holding
one's
papers
on
his
behalf
is
equivalent
to
directing
that
same
compulsion
against
the
person
himself
i
think,
essentially
a
principle
agency.
i
don't
see
why
a
man's
privileges
should
all
be
waived
just
by
delivering
his
records
to
a
temporary
bailee,
a
mere
naked
possessor.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
that
would
be
no
firm
basis
for
waiving
these
privileges.
we
take
the
position
here
and
look
in
for
a
moment
at
when
this
recommendation
for
criminal
prosecution
is
raised
or
at
what
point
it
becomes
a
criminal
matter.
justice
brennan
it
seems
to
me
if
the
taxpayer
was
not
in
jeopardy
then
why
would
the
government
for
instance
issue
a
miranda
warning
telling
her
that
she
was
in
jeopardy.
if
in
fact,
at
the
point
the
special
agent
comes
in,
we
have
at
district
trial
court
level
and
at
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
a
volunteer
to
produce
these
records
as
the
government
will
obtain
immunity
for
us
under
murphy
v.
waterfront
commission,
that
line
of
cases.
the
government
steadfastly
returns
to
grant
immunity
in
this
situation.
so
they
must
be
interested
in
this
point
in
securing
evidence
for
criminal
prosecution
otherwise
they
wouldn't
give
them
the
miranda
warning,
nor
would
they
refuse
to
grant
us
immunity
if
they
are
not
interested
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
we
don't
–
my
opponent
has
cited
the
problem
with
of
the
fourth
amendment
following
a
line
of
cases
on
title,
we
suggest
to
test
instants
of
ownership
of
these
records
that
should
be
to
test
and
rather
than
sticking
to
a
strict
title
situational,
although
most
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
government's
brief
in
perlman
and
burdeau
and
johnson
and
several
other
cases
like
that,
they
return
on
the
title
and
ownership
concept,
and
i
suggest
a
careful
reading
of
justice
blackmunn's
opinion
in
the
donaldson
case
were
surely
this
court
clearly
set
this
particular
question
aside
and
did
not
decide
in
that
case
and
the
inference
in
that
case
and
in
reisman
v.
caplin,
that
these
records
are
personal
records
and
should
be
protected
wherever
they
are,
just
as
in
the
fourth
amendment,
i
mean
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
situation
which
we
contend
this
falls
under
it
too,
because
i
think
of
necessity,
of
necessity
documents
that
are
subject
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
any
search
and
seizure
by
the
government
would
be
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
so
i
think
that
line
of
thought
necessarily
falls
over
in
this
area.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
if
your
summon
was
properly
granted,
i
think
you
assuming
the
problem,
our
position
is
the
location
or
naked
possession
of
these
document
is
not
the
test
as
who
owns
them
and
against
whom
is
this
directed.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
we
don't
think
that
subpoena
can
be
valid
if
it's
directed
toward
the
documents
owned
by
the
taxpayer.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
surrounding
this
case
are
both
clear
and
undisputed.
during
the
summer
of
1969,
a
field
revenue
agent
commenced
an
investigation
of
the
returns
of
the
petitioner
for
the
years
1964
through
1968.
petitioner
informed
him
that
her
records
were
temporarily
in
the
possession
of
her
accountant,
whereupon
the
field
agent
proceeded
to
the
accountant's
office
for
the
records
and
made
available
for
his
examination.
now
the
records
in
question
were
primarily
canceled
checks
and
working
papers
which
were
made
by
the
petitioner
in
her
own
handwriting
for
purposes
of
keeping
records
for
her
sole
proprietorship
restaurant.
the
field
agent
examined
the
records
for
several
days.
during
the
course
of
his
examination
he
apparently
suspected
that
criminal
fraud
was
involved
and
he
requested
and
received
the
assignment
of
a
special
revenue
agent.
the
trial
court
found
as
matter
of
fact
that
the
special
agent
in
his
capacity
as
such
was
conducting
a
joint
investigation
with
the
field
revenue
agent
for
the
purposes
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
the
income
tax
return,
plus
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
there
was
any
criminal
tax
fraud
in
the
case.
the
special
agent,
once
he
came
to
the
case,
proceeded
to
the
accountant's
offices,
observed
the
petitioner's
records,
and
thereupon
went
to
the
petitioner's
house
where
he
introduced
himself,
showed
his
credentials
and
gave
a
standard
miranda
warning
which
included
a
statement
that
she
did
not
have
to
produce
any
information
and
she
was
entitled
to
seek
a
lawyer's
counsel
before
she
responded
to
any
questions.
and
the
special
agent
proceeded
to
question
the
petitioner
and
then
proceeded
to
the
petitioner's
accountant's
office
to
seize
or
copy
the
records.
in
the
meantime,
petitioner
heeded
the
special
agent's
advice
and
had
contacted
her
accountant
and
lawyer,
and
advised
the
accountant
to
turn
the
records
over
to
no
one
but
her
attorney.
when
the
special
agent
arrived
at
the
accountant's
office,
the
accountant
refused
to
turnover
the
records.
the
special
agent
at
that
point
issued
a
summons
to
the
accountant
directing
him
to
turn
the
records
over.
from
the
special
agent's
return
to
the
accountant's
office
on
the
return
date,
he
discovered
that
the
accountant
had
already
turned
the
records
over
to
me
as
the
petitioner's
attorney.
the
government
then
instituted
a
proceeding
to
judicially
enforce
the
summons
under
7402(a)
and
7604(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
action
arises
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
virginia
affirmed
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
directing
me
to
turnover
the
books
and
records
in
question.
the
central
question
we
believe
in
this
case
is,
whether
or
not
the
privileges
against
self-incrimination
and
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
prevents
the
government
from
seizing
petitioner's
personal
books
and
records
whenever
they
are
out
of
her
actual
physical
possession.
by
way
of
background
i
think
the
government
has
never
denied
that
the
records
in
the
hands
of
the
accountant
were
the
property
of
the
petitioner.
in
fact
in
their
brief
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
they
conceded
that
the
records
in
question
had
they
been
in
the
hands
of
petitioner
would
have
been
protected
by
the
privilege.
thus
the
question
becomes
i
think
whether
records
created
and
owned
by
the
petitioner
somehow
lose
their
privileged
status
when
they
are
out
of
a
actual
physical
possession.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
i
believe
the
accountant
testified
that
the
records
had
been
delivered
to
him
over
a
period
of
years,
55
on
to
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
tax
returns.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
records
were
at
the
petitioner's
home
and
some
records
were
at
the
accountant's
office
and
she
delivered
the
balance
of
the
records
to
the
accountant
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
sub-investigation.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
records
were
owned
by
the
accountant.
in
fact,
the
petitioner
has
always
asserted
through
the
proceedings
below
that
they
were
clearly
her
records
and
owned
by
her
and
the
government
has
conceded
it.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
does
indicate
that
in
complete,
no
sir.
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
test
of
whether
she
may
rely
on
the
fifth
and
fourth
amendment
privileges
is
whether
she
possesses
substantial
instance
of
ownership
in
the
records.
and
we
submit
that
this
test
of
course,
would
be
subject
to
the
condition
at
where
a
taxpayer
voluntarily
and
knowingly
and
intentionally
published
the
records
then
they
would
lose
this
privilege.
in
essence,
i
believe
the
test
is
from
what
source
did
the
records
originate.
if
they
originated
with
the
petitioner,
they
should
be
protected.
if
they
did
not
then
they
should
not.
the
government
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
i
am.
the
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
are
a
series
of
cases
which
state
that
possession
is
not
the
test,
it
is
ownership
and
as
long
as
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
demand
or
the
taxpayer
had
the
right
to
demand
the
records
back,
that
possession
was
not
the
key
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
privileged.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no
we
do
not
assert
an
accountant-client
privilege,
we
will
concede
there
is
none.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
actually
either
agent
or
bailee,
since
regarded
an
agent
for
the
specific
purpose--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
he
was
actually
just
compensated
by
the
job.
i
think,
he
prepared
the
petitioner's
tax
returns
every
year
and
maybe
the
withholding
trust
fund
tax
deposit
forms.
he
actually
did
very
little
work
for
the
petitioner
but
this
was
his
function
with
her,
he
is
not
a
certified
public
accountant
but
more
in
the
line
of
a
bookkeeper
type.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
this
was
his
full-time
job.
he
had
been
doing
this
for
20
years
or
so.
i
think
the
importance
--
so
we
believe
that
the
ruling
question
that
we
submit
is
the
really
only
practical
and
workable
rule
which
this
court
that
can
adopt.
if
that
is
not
the
rule
and
if
the
government's
test
is
adopted,
i
think
the
alternatives
aren't
satisfactory.
we
could
return
to
the
case
of
burdeau
v.
mcdowell
by
this
court,
i
think
in
1921,
where
records
were
turned
over
to
prosecutor
which
had
been
obtained
by
a
party
breaking
into
a
man's
office,
blasting
the
safe
up
with
a
part
of
dynamite,
smashing
his
desk
on
axe
and
turning
the
records
over
to
prosecutor.
certainly
that
type
of
evidence
should
not
be
permitted.
they
introduced
in
the
evidence
that
we
agree
with
the
dissent
of
justice's
holmes
and
brandeis
and
they
said,
“what
could
be
more
shocking
to
our
sense
of
decency
and
fair
play
than
that?”
actually
the
court's
decision
did
not
go
off
on
the
point
of
possession
or
ownership,
they
merely
said,
this
court
merely
said,
“well
it
was
obtained
by
government
compulsion
so
it
must
be
okay.”
but
i
think
the
dissent,
there
has
to
be
the
proper
rule
in
that
case.
another
alternative
from
a
practical
and
policy
standpoint
is,
what
is
an
informed
tax
attorney
to
advice
to
his
accounting
firm
clients
if
the
government's
test
is
adopted.
he
advised
them
to
lease
their
file
storage
room
to
all
of
their
clients,
so
that
even
though
they
are
working
on
their
personal
handmade
records,
there
will
be
some
kind
of
constructive
possession
theory
that
they
rely
on
to
prevent
waiving
their
privileges.
i
don't
know
what
else
an
informed
attorney
could
advice
and
what
about
for
instance,
your
particular
taxpayer
class.
you
advise
them
to
only
permit
their
accountant
to
work
on
their
personal
records
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
home
and
in
the
same
room
with
them,
with
door
bolted,
preventing
internal
revenue
agent
from
intruding
with
the
summons
and
grasping
whatever
record
might
happen
to
be
in
the
accountant's
hand
at
that
moment.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
these
are
sales
records
made
in
his
personal
hand
and
the
government
however
has
conceded
that
these
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
these
were
made
in
her
personal
handwriting
for
her
sole
proprietorship
restaurant.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no
she
could
have
typed
it
or
something
of
that
nature
or
i
suggest
the
same
would
prevail
if
her
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well
the
government
can
obtain
those
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
we
would
concede
that
they
could
seize
them
but
those
are
not
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no,
she
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
this
case
as
an
example
we
had
the
gross
daily
receipt
worksheet
where
she
noted
each
one
of
her
three
shifts
at
the
restaurant.
she
took
that
to
cash
register.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
so
because
in
this
case
the
--
she
doesn't
really
sent
any
bills,
it's
a
cash
business,
a
cash
register
at
the
restaurant.
we
don't
believe
that
the
government's
test
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
i
think
you
could.
i
don't
have
any
--
part
of
that,
all
of
that's
actually
owned
by
the
restaurant.
the
customer
just
has
in
his
hand
to
notify
him
what
he
is
supposed
to
pay
and
returns
immediately
to
the
restaurant
owner
with
his
check.
but
we
don't
have
any
difficulty
seizing
that
either
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
think
the
reason
is
that
the
miranda
case
is
that,
the
miranda
case
in
escobedo
did
not
come
up
until
the
mid
60s
and
that
started
this
whole
chain
of
cases
when
taxpayers
discovered
they
had
rights
that
they
never
realized
they
had
before.
and
there
are
many
cases
starting
immediately
after
miranda,
there
is
a
long
string
of
these
cases.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well
this
court
has
a
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
in
the
matter
of
this
case,
this
court
went
so
far
to
say
that
tax
prosecution
were
not
immune
from
miranda
decision
and
the
case
you
decided,
the
donaldson
case,
i
believe,
two
years
ago,
you
specifically
stated
that
the
court
was
not
deciding
on
this
question.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
and
lawfully
we
have
the
weight
of
the
circuits,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
am
hard
pressed
to
think
of
just
one
case
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
i
think
all
the
cases
such
as
reisman
v.
caplin
for
instance
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
there
was
a
strong
inference
that
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
holdings
on
what
documents
are
privileged
and
what
aren't?
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
can't
--
we
are
going
back
to
boyd
v.
united
states
in
1886,
where
a
man
had
prepared
his
own
records
and
invoices.
they
said
that
this
class,
this
court
stated
that
this
class
of
documents
in
general
could
not
be
seized
in
the
possession
of
the
taxpayer
and
that
was
followed
by
counselman
v.
hitchcock,
and
cited
hundreds
of
times
since,
so
i
think
that's
the
place
to
start
your
honor,
it's
boyd
v.
untied
states
in
1886.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
we
don't
contest
the
admission
of
tax
returns.
they
have
been
given
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
all
of
this
is
on
schedules.
the
tax
returns
also
should
be
admissible.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
in
accounts,
working
papers
i
think
are
admissible
too.
i
think
---
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
think
the
records
prepared
about
taxpayer
for
purpose
of
making
his
return
should
be
privileged.
because
they
are
prepared
by
him
for
his
own
benefit
in
his
own
hand
and
they
are
not
part
of
the
tax
return.
those
are
personal
records.
the
government
goes
so
far
as
to
contend
and
i
believe
with
their
theory
if
any
time
it's
out
of
your
physical
possession
it
is
subject
to
subpoena.
justice
white,
if
i
were
helping
you
across
constitution
avenue
by
carrying
your
briefcase,
the
government
holds
that
they
could
hand
you
a
summons
in
the
middle
–
hand
me
a
summons
in
the
middle
of
constitution
avenue
and
seize
your
documents
to
use
against
you
in
a
criminal
trial.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
the
law
and
i
tend
to
agree
with
justice
holmes
and
brandeis,
it's
certainly
shocking
to
our
sense
of
fair
play.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well
the
canceled
checks
can
be
secured
from
the
bank.
i
would
feel
that
the
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
the
bank
keeps
a
copy
of
them.
most
banks
keep
copies
of
all
the
checks
that
they
clear.
that's
the
normal
method
of
preparing
a
networth
case
in
tax
court.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
i
would
–
although
the
government
has
been
so
kind
as
to
concede
that
that
would
be
privileged
i
would
doubt
that
a
canceled
check
could
be,
would
be
privileged.
what
we
are
talking
about
a
personal
payroll
records,
personal
worksheets
of
receipts
and
expenditure
and
things
of
that
nature
made
by
the
proprietor
for
her
own
purposes.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
i
think
when
you
get
into
wage
hour
cases
and
office
of
the
price
administration
cases
or
persons
where
the
records
are
specifically
required
to
be
kept
by
law
for
the
benefit
of
an
agency
or
a
tax
payer
enters
into
a
contract
with
the
government
to
provide
the
goods,
where
he
is
--
the
records
he
is
keeping
are
essentially
public
records
to
start
with
and
differ
substantially
from
these
records
that
are
used
to
prepare
the
tax
return.
another
policy
consideration
i
think
that
demands
attention
is
the
fact
that
i
believe
and
i
think
it
was
noted
in
the
stuart
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
internal
revenue
service
will
have
an
increasingly
difficult
time
enforcing
revenue
laws
if
the
government's
test
is
adopted.
the
congress
has
legislated
the
internal
revenue
court
appointed
it's
brilliant
comprehensible
to
the
average
person
and
even
to
the
average
attorney
and
most
taxpayers
today,
i
think,
find
it
necessary
to
enlist
the
aid
of
experts
such
as
accountants
and
tax
consultants
to
assist
them
in
the
preparation
of
their
returns.
i
submit
that
the
taxpayers
do
this
not
intending
to
give
up
either
ownership
or
privileges
under
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
in
the
donaldson
case
we
had
a
situation
where
the
government
was
subpoenaing,
he
was
given
the
summons
rather
to,
i
believe,
as
a
corporate
employer
for
the
corporate
employer's
records.
we
have
the
case
of
a
former
employee
coming
in
and
saying,
well
i
want
to
suppress
that
because
it
incriminates.
in
that
case
the
ownership
of
the
records
---
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
in
the
couch
--
in
the
case
before
the
court?
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
special
agent
was
just
coming
in
to
investigate.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
the
problem
comes,
if
a
person
prepared
documents
which
could
likely
contain
incriminating
evidence.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
that's
right
but
as
the
special
agent
testified
on
the
trial,
his
principal
purpose
of
his
job
is
to
ascertain
criminal
tax
fraud
and
the
purpose
i
think
in
the
miranda
case,
i
think,
that
the
point
is
reached
when
i
say
when
the
focal
point
of
the
investigation
changes
from
a
civil
rather
to
a
criminal
investigation,
at
that
point
the
defendants
and
the
have
the
right
to
exercise
it
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no
donaldson
specifically
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
specifically
--
well
the
efforts
in
donaldson
is
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
i
thank
they
stated
it,
this
do
not
have
to
do
with
records
whereas
the
taxpayers
had
no
proprietary
interest
of
any
kind,
which
were
owned
by
the
third
person
or
in
his
hands
and
which
relate
to
his
business
transactions
and
may
cite
it
with
approval
reisman
v.
caplin
in
which
case,
they
said
that
the
court
had
deemed
the
possession
to
be
the
same
as
if
they
were
in
the
possession
of
the
taxpayer
himself.
i
think,
the
inference
of
donaldson
favors
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes,
we
cooperated
and
delivered
the
papers.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir,
that’s
correct
for
civil
purposes,
but
at
the
point
where
his
investigation
shifts
to
a
criminal
one,
at
the
point
he
suspects
fraud,
at
that
point,
we
contend
he
must
warn
the
taxpayer
for
rights
and
at
that
point
he
loses
his
right
to
see
those
records.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
ownership
i
believe
was
at
test
in
donaldson,
the
government
is
going
after
the
corporation
with
their
records.
the
taxpayer
had
no
rights
whatsoever
to
those
records,
his
only
connection
was
they
were
incriminated.
here
in
our
record,
we
own
them
and
they
are
in
the
hands
of
our
agent
with
the
right
to
getting
back
immediately.
it’s
our
content
with
the
mere
naked
possession
by
one’s
agent
does
not
wave
the
rights
and
question.
that’s
the
basis
of
the
rule
we
suggest
to
this
court.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
and
that’s
the
--
there
are
many
cases
prior
to
the
issuance
of
revenue
ruling,
ir
949
i
think
it
is,
this
is
the
government
procedure.
there
are
many
cases
and
finally
adopted
the
procedure
that
once
they
suspect
fraud,
the
special
agent
will
be
brought
in,
it
will
give
them
miranda
warning.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
when
the
special
agent
was
brought
in,
his
first
act
was
to
proceed
to
the
taxpayer’s
home
and
give
this
miranda
warning.
we
can
see
that
they
did
this
properly.
we
can
see
that
after
we
had
gotten
a
warning,
we
would
be
entitled
to
heed
it
however
and
direct
our
agent
who
is
a
mere
naked
possessor
or
a
bailee
could
refuse
to
turn
it
over.
the
most
recent
case
which
has
come
up,
since
our
brief
and
is
noted
in
our
supplemental
brief
is
the
district
court
opinion
of
u.s
v.
sakuno
&
eto(ph)
which
is
identical
to
the
facts
of
the
series
of
cases
we
cite
in
our
favor
where
the
records
under
possession
of
the
accountant
and
they
belonged
to
the
taxpayer
and
the
government
handed
a
summons
to
the
accountant
and
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
in
couch
and
the
several
other
opinions
and
relying
heavily
on
the
donaldson
case
and
reisman
versus
caplin
found
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
in
that
case
who
said
the
government
could
not
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
but
he
was
not
a
salaried
employee,
as
opposed
to
common
law
employee
versus
independent
contractor,
he
was
an
independent
contractor,
yes
sir,
over
long
period
of
years.
i
think,
for
a
moment
it
might
be
worthwhile
examining
the
three
cases
the
government
relies
on.
i
mentioned
the
burdeau
v.
mcdowell
case
where
a
man
used
dynamite
and
hatchet
to
obtain
the
evidence,
i
think
that
clearly
cannot
be
the
law
any
longer,
they
also
rely
on
the
perlman
case
and
the
johnson
case.
mr.
johnson
took
bankruptcy
and
conveyed
his
records
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
this
was
a
voluntary
act,
he
transferred
ownership
and
he
transferred
possession
and
he
published
his
records
by
making
it
a
matter
of
public
record
with
the
court.
so
this
case
is
not
related
to
the
one
before
the
court
and
neither
is
the
case
entitled
perlman
v.
the
united
states
where
we
had
a
man
who
invented
a
pneumatic
wheel
and
obtained
a
patent
and
he
was
himself
in
a
patent
litigation,
he
introduced
the
wheel
and
exhibits
and
diagrams
and
documents
and
there
he
conveyed
title
to
the
equity
court,
he
conveyed
possessions
to
the
equity
court,
he
published
the
records.
so
i
think
that
court
is,
that
case
is
not
in
point,
he
was
subsequently
prosecuted
for
perjury
and
he
tried
to
suppress
this
information
but
since
you
have
transfer
of
possession
and
ownership
and
publication,
i
don’t
--
those
cases
seem
to
me
to
be
correct
but
not
in
point
to
the
case
before
us.
we
believe
that
the
government
has
not
cited
any
public
policy
reason
or
accepted
a
case
law
for
their
conclusion
that
possession
is
the
test
of
the
whether
you
waive
the
fifth
and
fourth
amendment
privileges.
on
the
contrary,
we
suggest
that
the
policy
reasons
which
i
have
cited
plus
the
numerous
cases
citing
the
brief,
which
don't
bear
going
into
at
this
time,
should
be
the
basis
of
adopting
our
test
of
ownership
as
being
the
key
rather
than
the
location
or
possession.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
above.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
think
donaldson
was
purely
the
case
of
--
in
donaldson,
you've
said,
as
i
recall,
that
ownership
was
the
test,
but
since
the
corporation
owned
the
records
that
a
former
employee
had
no
rights
to
them
in
the
them,
and
since
ownership
was
the
test,
that
he
could
not
suppress
the
evidence.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
no,
this
case
had
already
reached
the
point
where
the
criminal
fraud
investigator
entered
the
picture
and
gave
the
warning,
there
had
been
no
recommendation
to
prosecute.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
i
recall
the
statistics
prepared
by
professor
charles
blaine(ph)
that
roughly
90%
of
all
convictions
obtained
by
the
justice
department
obtained
are
on
the
self-incrimination
of
the
taxpayer.
there
are
many
that
are
--
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
and
contend
that
the
rights
and
questions
are
personal,
the
human
civil
type
rights
to
protect
one's
documents
and
the
compulsion,
directed
against
one's
agent
who
is
holding
one's
papers
on
his
behalf
is
equivalent
to
directing
that
same
compulsion
against
the
person
himself
i
think,
essentially
a
principle
agency.
i
don't
see
why
a
man's
privileges
should
all
be
waived
just
by
delivering
his
records
to
a
temporary
bailee,
a
mere
naked
possessor.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
that
would
be
no
firm
basis
for
waiving
these
privileges.
we
take
the
position
here
and
look
in
for
a
moment
at
when
this
recommendation
for
criminal
prosecution
is
raised
or
at
what
point
it
becomes
a
criminal
matter.
justice
brennan
it
seems
to
me
if
the
taxpayer
was
not
in
jeopardy
then
why
would
the
government
for
instance
issue
a
miranda
warning
telling
her
that
she
was
in
jeopardy.
if
in
fact,
at
the
point
the
special
agent
comes
in,
we
have
at
district
trial
court
level
and
at
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
a
volunteer
to
produce
these
records
as
the
government
will
obtain
immunity
for
us
under
murphy
v.
waterfront
commission,
that
line
of
cases.
the
government
steadfastly
returns
to
grant
immunity
in
this
situation.
so
they
must
be
interested
in
this
point
in
securing
evidence
for
criminal
prosecution
otherwise
they
wouldn't
give
them
the
miranda
warning,
nor
would
they
refuse
to
grant
us
immunity
if
they
are
not
interested
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
we
don't
–
my
opponent
has
cited
the
problem
with
of
the
fourth
amendment
following
a
line
of
cases
on
title,
we
suggest
to
test
instants
of
ownership
of
these
records
that
should
be
to
test
and
rather
than
sticking
to
a
strict
title
situational,
although
most
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
government's
brief
in
perlman
and
burdeau
and
johnson
and
several
other
cases
like
that,
they
return
on
the
title
and
ownership
concept,
and
i
suggest
a
careful
reading
of
justice
blackmunn's
opinion
in
the
donaldson
case
were
surely
this
court
clearly
set
this
particular
question
aside
and
did
not
decide
in
that
case
and
the
inference
in
that
case
and
in
reisman
v.
caplin,
that
these
records
are
personal
records
and
should
be
protected
wherever
they
are,
just
as
in
the
fourth
amendment,
i
mean
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
situation
which
we
contend
this
falls
under
it
too,
because
i
think
of
necessity,
of
necessity
documents
that
are
subject
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
any
search
and
seizure
by
the
government
would
be
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
so
i
think
that
line
of
thought
necessarily
falls
over
in
this
area.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
well,
if
your
summon
was
properly
granted,
i
think
you
assuming
the
problem,
our
position
is
the
location
or
naked
possession
of
these
document
is
not
the
test
as
who
owns
them
and
against
whom
is
this
directed.
mr.
john
g.
rocovich,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
we
don't
think
that
subpoena
can
be
valid
if
it's
directed
toward
the
documents
owned
by
the
taxpayer.
