mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
as
in
donaldson
against
the
united
states,
a
joint
investigation
by
a
revenue
agent
and
a
special
agent
is
proceeding
prior
to
any
recommendation
for
a
prosecution,
and
we
believe
that
the
issue
of
the
statutory
authorization
for
the
issuance
and
enforcement
of
the
summons
in
this
situation
was
decided
by
the
court
in
donaldson.
it's
true
that
in
donaldson,
the
taxpayer
seeking
to
intervene
and
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding
there
had,
no
proprietary
interest
and
asserted
no
proprietary
interest
whatsoever
in
the
corporate
records
of
its
former
employees,
that
were
the
subject
of
the
summons.
and
because
of
that,
the
court
unanimously
held
that
the
taxpayer
had
no
right
to
intervene
in
such
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding.
here
by
contrast,
the
taxpayer
was
permitted
to
intervene,
indeed
the
government
did
not
oppose
the
taxpayer's
intervention
because
the
taxpayer
was
asserting
proprietary
interest
in
the
records.
but
all
of
the
discussion
in
the
donaldson
opinion
about
the
lack
of
the
proprietary
interest
in
the
records
was
in
the
context
of
the
initial
issue,
the
intervention
issue
in
donaldson
and
two
justices
of
the
court
expressed
the
view
that
that
was
all
of
the
court
should
decide
in
donaldson,
that
the
taxpayer
had
no
right
to
intervene.
seven
justices
however
proceeded
in
donaldson
to
decide
the
issue
that
the
taxpayer
was
seeking
to
raise
through
his
intervention
since
the
issue
had
been
fully
argued
and
was
an
important
issue
in
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
and
in
the
court's
opinion,
that
issue
was
expressed
as
follows,
donaldson
however
strenuously
urges
in
addition
that
an
internal
revenue
summons
proceeding
may
not
be
utilized
at
all
in
aid
of
an
investigation
that
has
the
potentiality
of
resulting
in
a
recommendation
that
a
criminal
prosecution
be
instituted
against
the
taxpayer.
there
is
no
reference
in
this
part
of
the
court's
opinion
who
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
records.
indeed,
what
the
opinion
does
is
explained
the
meaning
of
the
court's
holding
in
reisman
which
was
the
case
in
which
the
taxpayer
was
asserting
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
the
dictum
in
reisman,
what
the
court
did
was
explain
the
meaning
of
the
dictum
in
riesman
and
interpret
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
issuances
of
internal
revenue
summons,
whether
to
the
taxpayer,
to
those
dealing
with
the
taxpayer
or
in
the
particular
case
to
former
employers
and
we
did
not
regard
you
the
matter
that
has
been
decided
only
two
terms
ago
and
it
was
fully
briefed
in
the
donaldson
brief
in
our
case
on
pages
24
through
38
of
our
brief.
in
donaldson
in
our
view
that
issue
has
been
decided
and
the
new
issue
presented
in
this
case
as
we
view
it,
the
principle
the
issue
is
rather
the
issuance
and
enforcement
of
the
summons
here,
are
inconsistent
with
the
taxpayers
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
we
will
turn
to
that.
now
in
one,
perhaps
attenuated
sense
of
that
language
an
accused
is
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
whenever
a
third
person
discloses
in
a
proceeding
what
the
accused
has
communicated
to
it.
when
the
third
person
is
required
to
disclose
it.
whether
that
communication
was
oral
or
written?
of
course
the
fifth
amendment
has
never
been
extended
to
that
extreme
and
should
not
be
in
light
of
its
historical
purpose.
if
it
were
extended
to
that
extreme,
all
communications
instead
of
just
a
few
specific
categories
if
communications
would
be
privileged
communications.
now
as
we
understand
it
the
petitioner
here
is
not
contending
that
communications
to
an
accountant
are
privileged
under
federal
law
and
the
case
is
uniformly
holding
or
not
and
nor
is
it
contended
that
the
accountant
cannot
constitutionally
be
required
to
disclose
communications
the
taxpayer
made
to
him
which
may
tend
to
incriminate
the
taxpayer,
so
long
as
the
disclosure
is
in
the
form
of
oral
testimony
by
the
accountant
of
what
the
taxpayer
communicated
to
him,
or
in
the
form
of
the
production
of
records
or
documents
owned
by
the
accountant.
so
a
claim
here
is
that
if
the
taxpayer
owns
the
paper
in
the
accountant's
possession
on
which
the
information
is
written,
the
fifth
amendment
protects
the
taxpayer
against
the
production
of
those
records
by
the
accountant,
even
though
the
information
disclosed
to
the
accountant
is
not
privileged.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
might
be
a
statutory
problem
about
whether
a
summons
would
be
the
proper
form
of
procedure.
on
the
constitutional
issue
our
position
would
be
the
same,
out
position
is
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
when
the
compulsion
is
on
a
third
person.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it's
the
accountant
who
is
being
compelled
to
produce
them
rather
than
the
taxpayer.
the
accountant
does
not
claimed
that
he
may
tend
to
be
incriminated
by
their
production.
now
for
decades
in
fourth
amendment
litigation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
response
to
a
summons
the
taxpayer
has
been
claiming
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
been
honoring
that
claim
with
respect
to
the
taxpayer's
production
of
records.
we
think
that's
what
the
holding
of
boyd
implies
and
boyd
has
not
been
a
rule
in
that
respect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
when
the
taxpayer
is
being
asked
to
produce
the
records,
i
think
a
different
issue
would
be
raised
by
an
attempt
under
a
search
warrant
to
reach
the
records,
if
they
are
not
been
asked
to
produce
them
himself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
internal
revenue
service
is
complying
with
what
it
understands
to
be
the
holding
of
boyd
as
more
recently
explained
in
the
schmerber
opinion
of
this
court
that
production
of
records
is
compelling
a
response
which
is
also
a
communication.
now
the
mcnaughton
addition
of
wigmore
explains
that
as
meaning
that
when
the
taxpayer
or
other
individual
has
to
come
forward
in
response
to
the
production
order
he
is
in
effect
testifying
that
these
are
the
records
requested
in
the
order
that
this
is
an
authentication
from
him,
an
identification
of
these
as
the
records
requested
and
wigmore
for
that
reason
distinguishes
this
situation
from
the
situation
under
a
search
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
we
would
be
willing
to
argue
that
but
that
really
isn't
an
issue
in
this
case
and
i
can't
say
we
have
explored
it
for
purposes
of
this
case.
i
think
the
rationale
of
boyd
as
it
fits
into
subsequent
cases
of
this
court
indicates
that
the
search
warrant
situation
is
a
very
different
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
was
not
being
compelled
to
produce
them.
the
compulsion
is
not
on
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
internal
revenue
service
practice,
so
long
as
the
taxpayer
has
retained
possession
of
the
records
and
they
are
being
used
only
by
his
full
time
employees
or
others
on
the
taxpayer's
premises
after
the
taxpayer
having
relinquished
possession
and
control
of
the
records,
we
ordinarily
in
those
situations
issue
the
summons
to
the
taxpayer
because
it's
the
taxpayer
who
has
the
dominion
over
the
records
and
the
authority
to
return
the
summons
and
if
the
taxpayer
chooses
to
plead
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
that's
up
the
taxpayer.
it's
when
the
tax--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
after
the
relinquishment
of
possession,
when
the
taxpayer
has
turned
over
the
possessory
right
to
someone
else
so
that
he
has
the
power
to
comply
with
the
summons
and
the
summon
is
issued
to
him
and
the
compulsory
process
is
on
him.
when
he
is
in
rightful
possession,
it
need
not
be
the
permanent
possession
and
it
certainly
need
not
carry
title
in
our
view.
i
would
say
that's
the
way
we
draw
the
line
in
the
internal
revenue
service
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
there
could
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
crucial
question
is
whether
the
taxpayer
has
relinquished
possession.
there
are
some
cases
where
this
question
is
difficult
to
answer
mr.
justice
and
i
am
not
sure
i
can
tell
you
what
our
position
would
be
about
these
particular
hypothetical.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
seems
clear
us
here
that
records
that
were
given
to
this
accountant
from
1955
on
remained
in
his
continuous
possession
up
until
the
fall
of
1968
when
this
summons
was
issued,
were
out
of
the
possession
in
control
of
the
taxpayer
whether
the
taxpayer
technically
retained
title
to
them
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
she
had
given
them
already
to
someone
else's
possession,
she
didn't
abandon
her
proprietary
interest.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
gets
me
back
to
the
principle
contention
in
this
case
that
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
should
depend
on
proprietary
interest.
for
decades
and
in
fourth
amendment
litigation,
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
have
struggled
to
apply
concepts
of
property
rights,
concepts
of
who
has
superior
proprietary
interest
in
the
particular
property
that
gave
rise
to
the
mere
evidence
rule
and
to
its
exceptions
and
this
effort
as
the
court
well
knows
came
to
grief
because
it
deflected
analysis
away
from
the
true
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
protection
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
extent
they
are
protected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
limits
of
the
fourth
amendment
protection
are
not
coextensive
with
your
retaining
possession
over
your
own
effects,
although
the
protection
becomes
more
attenuated.
i
am
just
trying
to
draw
an
analogy
here
between
the
experience
the
court
had
with
a
focus
on
proprietary
interest
as
the
controlling
consideration
in
fourth
amendment
litigation
which
in
warden
against
hayden
and
in
katz
against
the
united
states,
the
court
rejected
as
having
proved
unsatisfactory.
i
am
trying
to
draw
an
analogy
here
for
purposes
of
fifth
amendment
litigation.
in
fifth
amendment
litigation
which
we
are
concerned
with
here,
the
court
for
many
years
has
refused
to
fall
into
a
similar
fallacy
of
giving
controlling
significance
to
questions
of
property
rights
and
perhaps
this
was
avoided
because
it
was
clear
at
the
outset
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
even
less
concerned
with
property
interest
than
is
the
fourth
amendment
right.
the
great
historic
purpose
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
to
protect
the
individual
against
forcible
extraction
of
testimony
by
the
government
from
the
lips
of
the
accused,
and
the
principle
issue
in
fifth
amendment
litigation
is
whether
the
accused
is
being
compelled
to
testify
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor,
the
man
has
conceded
that
if
the
accountant
had
made
his
own
work
papers
or
his
own
xerox
copies
that
are
already
here
in
these
documents,
that
those
would
be
subject
to
production,
which
to
us
highlights
what
seems
to
be
the
inadequacy
of
saying
that
the
great
fifth
amendment
privilege
turns
on
who
happens
to
have
the
title
to
the
pieces
of
paper
on
which
the
information
is
written.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
have
previously
said,
we
would
honor
a
claim
if
we
had
asked
mrs.
couch
in
the
summons
to
produce
this
material
on
the
theory
that
she
could
get
it
back
from
her
accountant
and
to
comply
with
the
summons
and
she
had
pleaded
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
as
far
as
i
am
aware
we
would
honor
that
plea.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it's
more
questionable
when
she
didn't
have
possession
of
the
records
but
still
the
compulsion
would
be
on
the
accused
who
are
the
individual
who
was
worrying
about
incriminating
herself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
boyd
is
the
only
decision
in
point
as
boyd
has
been
interpreted
as
meaning
that
the
response
is
also
a
communication
in
that
by
producing
the
individual
is
authenticating
these
as
the
records
that
were
requested.
as
i
said,
that
rationale
of
boyd,
it
seems
to
me
applies
to
a
subpoena
production
order
but
not
to
a
search
and
seizure
pursuant
to
a
to
a
search
warrant
based
upon
probable
cause.
in
warden
against
hayden,
the
court
specifically
reserved
decision
on
the
question
whether
there
are
any
categories
of
papers
or
other
materials
that
are
immune
from
reasonable
search
warrants.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
since
decided
the
issue,
nor
has
it
presented
in
this
case.
this
case
involves
a
production
order
and
not
to
the
individual
who
is
concerned
about
self-incrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
implies
that,
the
record
doesn't
show
how
he
was
compensated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
thing
that
matters
is
whether
the
taxpayer
relinquished
possession
of
records
to
him
so
that
the
compulsion
could
be
on
him
rather
than
on
the
taxpayer
for
their
production.
i
think
that's
the
thing
that
matters,
and
we
think
the
record
adequately
shows
that
and
that
has
not
been
disputed.
the
petitioner's
reliance
is
solely
on
who
has
the
title
to
the
papers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
your
honor.
i
learned
it
for
the
first
time
when
he
cited
it.
and
as
far
as
i
know
that
is
accurate
but
i
have
--
i
could
say
i
have
a
reason
to
believe
that
it's
accurate
from
what
i
have
been
told
by
the
internal
revenue
service
but
i
don't
dispute
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
for
us,
rather
we
could
say
that
the
taxpayer
could
relinquish
possession
there.
here
it's
clear
that
possession
has
been
turned
over
to
someone
who
has
a
separate
office
and
these
records
have
been
in
that
office
for
many
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i
know
the
reason
those
cases
don't
arise,
it's
because
in
those
cases
we
issue
the
summons
to
the
employer.
of
course,
if
the
employer
is
a
corporation,
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
worry
about.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that's
what
we
have
to
(inaudible)
your
honor
private
with
respect
to
the
claim
that's
being
made
here
but
the
government
cannot
have
access
to
them.
this
is
in
response
to
the
fourth
amendment
claim
which
is
essentially
prior
the
fifth
amendment
claim
on
the
facts
of
this
case
so
far
as
we
read
the
claims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
taken
the
position
that
when
information
is
given
to
the
lawyer
solely
for
the
purpose
of
preparation
of
income
tax
returns,
that
is
not
a
confidential
communication
to
the
lawyer.
those
materials
are
given
to
the
lawyer
to
be
synthesized
as
the
lawyer
sees
it
fit
to
be
communicated
onto
the
government
and
therefore
those
communications
are
not
within
the
attorney-client
privilege.
when
the
information
is
turned
over
to
the
lawyer
for
purposes
of
seeking
his
legal
advice,
i
think
it
is
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
we
had
court
of
appeals
holdings
on
that
point,
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
they
do
sir.
they
are
on
page
18
of
our
brief
at
the
top.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
fifth
amendment,
yes
i
think
there
would
be
a
sixth
amendment
issue,
about
the
attorney-client
privilege.
there
maybe
some
basis
for
the
attorney-client
privilege
when
legal
advice
is
sought
in
the
sixth
amendment,
when
there
has
been
a
confidential
communication
to
the
attorney.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
i
presume.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
might
possibly
be
some
civil
remedy
between
the
accountant
and
his
client
for
breach
of
professional
duty
if
they
are
recognized
by
state
law,
i
think
this
would
be
a
question
of
state
law
and
i
frankly
have
not
looked
into
it.
now
we
have
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief,
on
pages
14
through
16,
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held
that
the
issue
is
not
proprietary,
interest
of
proprietary
rights.
when
a
fifth
amendment
claim
is
raised
with
respect
to
the
compelled
production
of
records
and
the
compulsion
operates
on
a
third
person.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
these
cases
in
various
ways,
but
if
the
distinction
is
really
overlooked
the
rationale
of
the
cases,
which
is
pretty
well
summarized
in
the
quotation
on
page
15
at
the
end
of
the
quotation,
on
the
perlman
case,
where
reliance
was
placed
solely
on
a
claim
of
title,
which
the
court
didn't
even
decide
because
it
considered
unnecessary
to
decide,
because
as
the
court
said,
the
criterion
of
immunity
is
not
the
ownership
of
property
but
the
physical
or
moral
compulsion
exerted.
based
on
the
reasoning
of
the
epigram
of
justice
holmes
in
the
leading
case,
johnson
against
united
states
that
a
party
is
privileged
from
producing
the
evidence,
but
not
from
its
production,
it
is
true
that
in
the
case
involving
the
introduction
of
the
stolen
records
justices
holmes
and
brandeis
dissented
from
the
holding
that
that
dissent
was
not
based
on
the
view
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
have
been
violated
by
the
introduction
of
the
records
and
evidence.
indeed,
it
was
premised
very
explicitly
on
the
proposition
that
no
constitutional
provision
had
been
violated
and
that
they
were
accepting
as
true,
the
majorities
holding
that
the
papers
could
have
been
subpoenaed
from
the
faith.
but,
the
dissenting
opinion
said,
that
there
are
principles
of
decency
and
fair
play
which
lead
them
to
the
conclusion
that
the
evidence
should
not
be
accepted
in
this
case,
for
all
that's
written
in
the
opinion,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
holding,
but
a
rule
of
evidence
in
their
view
that
congress
could
have
overturned.
the
dissent
is
not
at
all
premised
on
the
idea
that
there
had
been
a
fifth
amendment
violation
nor
has
any
other
case
in
this
court
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
violated
when
someone
else
is
compelled
to
produce
evidence
created
by
or
owned
by
the
person
attempting
to
claim
the
privilege
who
is
not
himself
being
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
as
in
donaldson
against
the
united
states,
a
joint
investigation
by
a
revenue
agent
and
a
special
agent
is
proceeding
prior
to
any
recommendation
for
a
prosecution,
and
we
believe
that
the
issue
of
the
statutory
authorization
for
the
issuance
and
enforcement
of
the
summons
in
this
situation
was
decided
by
the
court
in
donaldson.
it's
true
that
in
donaldson,
the
taxpayer
seeking
to
intervene
and
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding
there
had,
no
proprietary
interest
and
asserted
no
proprietary
interest
whatsoever
in
the
corporate
records
of
its
former
employees,
that
were
the
subject
of
the
summons.
and
because
of
that,
the
court
unanimously
held
that
the
taxpayer
had
no
right
to
intervene
in
such
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding.
here
by
contrast,
the
taxpayer
was
permitted
to
intervene,
indeed
the
government
did
not
oppose
the
taxpayer's
intervention
because
the
taxpayer
was
asserting
proprietary
interest
in
the
records.
but
all
of
the
discussion
in
the
donaldson
opinion
about
the
lack
of
the
proprietary
interest
in
the
records
was
in
the
context
of
the
initial
issue,
the
intervention
issue
in
donaldson
and
two
justices
of
the
court
expressed
the
view
that
that
was
all
of
the
court
should
decide
in
donaldson,
that
the
taxpayer
had
no
right
to
intervene.
seven
justices
however
proceeded
in
donaldson
to
decide
the
issue
that
the
taxpayer
was
seeking
to
raise
through
his
intervention
since
the
issue
had
been
fully
argued
and
was
an
important
issue
in
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
and
in
the
court's
opinion,
that
issue
was
expressed
as
follows,
donaldson
however
strenuously
urges
in
addition
that
an
internal
revenue
summons
proceeding
may
not
be
utilized
at
all
in
aid
of
an
investigation
that
has
the
potentiality
of
resulting
in
a
recommendation
that
a
criminal
prosecution
be
instituted
against
the
taxpayer.
there
is
no
reference
in
this
part
of
the
court's
opinion
who
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
records.
indeed,
what
the
opinion
does
is
explained
the
meaning
of
the
court's
holding
in
reisman
which
was
the
case
in
which
the
taxpayer
was
asserting
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
the
dictum
in
reisman,
what
the
court
did
was
explain
the
meaning
of
the
dictum
in
riesman
and
interpret
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
issuances
of
internal
revenue
summons,
whether
to
the
taxpayer,
to
those
dealing
with
the
taxpayer
or
in
the
particular
case
to
former
employers
and
we
did
not
regard
you
the
matter
that
has
been
decided
only
two
terms
ago
and
it
was
fully
briefed
in
the
donaldson
brief
in
our
case
on
pages
24
through
38
of
our
brief.
in
donaldson
in
our
view
that
issue
has
been
decided
and
the
new
issue
presented
in
this
case
as
we
view
it,
the
principle
the
issue
is
rather
the
issuance
and
enforcement
of
the
summons
here,
are
inconsistent
with
the
taxpayers
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
we
will
turn
to
that.
now
in
one,
perhaps
attenuated
sense
of
that
language
an
accused
is
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
whenever
a
third
person
discloses
in
a
proceeding
what
the
accused
has
communicated
to
it.
when
the
third
person
is
required
to
disclose
it.
whether
that
communication
was
oral
or
written?
of
course
the
fifth
amendment
has
never
been
extended
to
that
extreme
and
should
not
be
in
light
of
its
historical
purpose.
if
it
were
extended
to
that
extreme,
all
communications
instead
of
just
a
few
specific
categories
if
communications
would
be
privileged
communications.
now
as
we
understand
it
the
petitioner
here
is
not
contending
that
communications
to
an
accountant
are
privileged
under
federal
law
and
the
case
is
uniformly
holding
or
not
and
nor
is
it
contended
that
the
accountant
cannot
constitutionally
be
required
to
disclose
communications
the
taxpayer
made
to
him
which
may
tend
to
incriminate
the
taxpayer,
so
long
as
the
disclosure
is
in
the
form
of
oral
testimony
by
the
accountant
of
what
the
taxpayer
communicated
to
him,
or
in
the
form
of
the
production
of
records
or
documents
owned
by
the
accountant.
so
a
claim
here
is
that
if
the
taxpayer
owns
the
paper
in
the
accountant's
possession
on
which
the
information
is
written,
the
fifth
amendment
protects
the
taxpayer
against
the
production
of
those
records
by
the
accountant,
even
though
the
information
disclosed
to
the
accountant
is
not
privileged.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
might
be
a
statutory
problem
about
whether
a
summons
would
be
the
proper
form
of
procedure.
on
the
constitutional
issue
our
position
would
be
the
same,
out
position
is
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
when
the
compulsion
is
on
a
third
person.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it's
the
accountant
who
is
being
compelled
to
produce
them
rather
than
the
taxpayer.
the
accountant
does
not
claimed
that
he
may
tend
to
be
incriminated
by
their
production.
now
for
decades
in
fourth
amendment
litigation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
response
to
a
summons
the
taxpayer
has
been
claiming
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
been
honoring
that
claim
with
respect
to
the
taxpayer's
production
of
records.
we
think
that's
what
the
holding
of
boyd
implies
and
boyd
has
not
been
a
rule
in
that
respect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
when
the
taxpayer
is
being
asked
to
produce
the
records,
i
think
a
different
issue
would
be
raised
by
an
attempt
under
a
search
warrant
to
reach
the
records,
if
they
are
not
been
asked
to
produce
them
himself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
internal
revenue
service
is
complying
with
what
it
understands
to
be
the
holding
of
boyd
as
more
recently
explained
in
the
schmerber
opinion
of
this
court
that
production
of
records
is
compelling
a
response
which
is
also
a
communication.
now
the
mcnaughton
addition
of
wigmore
explains
that
as
meaning
that
when
the
taxpayer
or
other
individual
has
to
come
forward
in
response
to
the
production
order
he
is
in
effect
testifying
that
these
are
the
records
requested
in
the
order
that
this
is
an
authentication
from
him,
an
identification
of
these
as
the
records
requested
and
wigmore
for
that
reason
distinguishes
this
situation
from
the
situation
under
a
search
warrant.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
we
would
be
willing
to
argue
that
but
that
really
isn't
an
issue
in
this
case
and
i
can't
say
we
have
explored
it
for
purposes
of
this
case.
i
think
the
rationale
of
boyd
as
it
fits
into
subsequent
cases
of
this
court
indicates
that
the
search
warrant
situation
is
a
very
different
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
was
not
being
compelled
to
produce
them.
the
compulsion
is
not
on
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
internal
revenue
service
practice,
so
long
as
the
taxpayer
has
retained
possession
of
the
records
and
they
are
being
used
only
by
his
full
time
employees
or
others
on
the
taxpayer's
premises
after
the
taxpayer
having
relinquished
possession
and
control
of
the
records,
we
ordinarily
in
those
situations
issue
the
summons
to
the
taxpayer
because
it's
the
taxpayer
who
has
the
dominion
over
the
records
and
the
authority
to
return
the
summons
and
if
the
taxpayer
chooses
to
plead
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
that's
up
the
taxpayer.
it's
when
the
tax--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
after
the
relinquishment
of
possession,
when
the
taxpayer
has
turned
over
the
possessory
right
to
someone
else
so
that
he
has
the
power
to
comply
with
the
summons
and
the
summon
is
issued
to
him
and
the
compulsory
process
is
on
him.
when
he
is
in
rightful
possession,
it
need
not
be
the
permanent
possession
and
it
certainly
need
not
carry
title
in
our
view.
i
would
say
that's
the
way
we
draw
the
line
in
the
internal
revenue
service
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
there
could
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
crucial
question
is
whether
the
taxpayer
has
relinquished
possession.
there
are
some
cases
where
this
question
is
difficult
to
answer
mr.
justice
and
i
am
not
sure
i
can
tell
you
what
our
position
would
be
about
these
particular
hypothetical.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
seems
clear
us
here
that
records
that
were
given
to
this
accountant
from
1955
on
remained
in
his
continuous
possession
up
until
the
fall
of
1968
when
this
summons
was
issued,
were
out
of
the
possession
in
control
of
the
taxpayer
whether
the
taxpayer
technically
retained
title
to
them
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
she
had
given
them
already
to
someone
else's
possession,
she
didn't
abandon
her
proprietary
interest.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
gets
me
back
to
the
principle
contention
in
this
case
that
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
should
depend
on
proprietary
interest.
for
decades
and
in
fourth
amendment
litigation,
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
have
struggled
to
apply
concepts
of
property
rights,
concepts
of
who
has
superior
proprietary
interest
in
the
particular
property
that
gave
rise
to
the
mere
evidence
rule
and
to
its
exceptions
and
this
effort
as
the
court
well
knows
came
to
grief
because
it
deflected
analysis
away
from
the
true
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
protection
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
extent
they
are
protected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
limits
of
the
fourth
amendment
protection
are
not
coextensive
with
your
retaining
possession
over
your
own
effects,
although
the
protection
becomes
more
attenuated.
i
am
just
trying
to
draw
an
analogy
here
between
the
experience
the
court
had
with
a
focus
on
proprietary
interest
as
the
controlling
consideration
in
fourth
amendment
litigation
which
in
warden
against
hayden
and
in
katz
against
the
united
states,
the
court
rejected
as
having
proved
unsatisfactory.
i
am
trying
to
draw
an
analogy
here
for
purposes
of
fifth
amendment
litigation.
in
fifth
amendment
litigation
which
we
are
concerned
with
here,
the
court
for
many
years
has
refused
to
fall
into
a
similar
fallacy
of
giving
controlling
significance
to
questions
of
property
rights
and
perhaps
this
was
avoided
because
it
was
clear
at
the
outset
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
even
less
concerned
with
property
interest
than
is
the
fourth
amendment
right.
the
great
historic
purpose
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
to
protect
the
individual
against
forcible
extraction
of
testimony
by
the
government
from
the
lips
of
the
accused,
and
the
principle
issue
in
fifth
amendment
litigation
is
whether
the
accused
is
being
compelled
to
testify
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
your
honor,
the
man
has
conceded
that
if
the
accountant
had
made
his
own
work
papers
or
his
own
xerox
copies
that
are
already
here
in
these
documents,
that
those
would
be
subject
to
production,
which
to
us
highlights
what
seems
to
be
the
inadequacy
of
saying
that
the
great
fifth
amendment
privilege
turns
on
who
happens
to
have
the
title
to
the
pieces
of
paper
on
which
the
information
is
written.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
have
previously
said,
we
would
honor
a
claim
if
we
had
asked
mrs.
couch
in
the
summons
to
produce
this
material
on
the
theory
that
she
could
get
it
back
from
her
accountant
and
to
comply
with
the
summons
and
she
had
pleaded
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
as
far
as
i
am
aware
we
would
honor
that
plea.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it's
more
questionable
when
she
didn't
have
possession
of
the
records
but
still
the
compulsion
would
be
on
the
accused
who
are
the
individual
who
was
worrying
about
incriminating
herself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
boyd
is
the
only
decision
in
point
as
boyd
has
been
interpreted
as
meaning
that
the
response
is
also
a
communication
in
that
by
producing
the
individual
is
authenticating
these
as
the
records
that
were
requested.
as
i
said,
that
rationale
of
boyd,
it
seems
to
me
applies
to
a
subpoena
production
order
but
not
to
a
search
and
seizure
pursuant
to
a
to
a
search
warrant
based
upon
probable
cause.
in
warden
against
hayden,
the
court
specifically
reserved
decision
on
the
question
whether
there
are
any
categories
of
papers
or
other
materials
that
are
immune
from
reasonable
search
warrants.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
since
decided
the
issue,
nor
has
it
presented
in
this
case.
this
case
involves
a
production
order
and
not
to
the
individual
who
is
concerned
about
self-incrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
implies
that,
the
record
doesn't
show
how
he
was
compensated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
thing
that
matters
is
whether
the
taxpayer
relinquished
possession
of
records
to
him
so
that
the
compulsion
could
be
on
him
rather
than
on
the
taxpayer
for
their
production.
i
think
that's
the
thing
that
matters,
and
we
think
the
record
adequately
shows
that
and
that
has
not
been
disputed.
the
petitioner's
reliance
is
solely
on
who
has
the
title
to
the
papers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
your
honor.
i
learned
it
for
the
first
time
when
he
cited
it.
and
as
far
as
i
know
that
is
accurate
but
i
have
--
i
could
say
i
have
a
reason
to
believe
that
it's
accurate
from
what
i
have
been
told
by
the
internal
revenue
service
but
i
don't
dispute
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
for
us,
rather
we
could
say
that
the
taxpayer
could
relinquish
possession
there.
here
it's
clear
that
possession
has
been
turned
over
to
someone
who
has
a
separate
office
and
these
records
have
been
in
that
office
for
many
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i
know
the
reason
those
cases
don't
arise,
it's
because
in
those
cases
we
issue
the
summons
to
the
employer.
of
course,
if
the
employer
is
a
corporation,
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
worry
about.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that's
what
we
have
to
(inaudible)
your
honor
private
with
respect
to
the
claim
that's
being
made
here
but
the
government
cannot
have
access
to
them.
this
is
in
response
to
the
fourth
amendment
claim
which
is
essentially
prior
the
fifth
amendment
claim
on
the
facts
of
this
case
so
far
as
we
read
the
claims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
taken
the
position
that
when
information
is
given
to
the
lawyer
solely
for
the
purpose
of
preparation
of
income
tax
returns,
that
is
not
a
confidential
communication
to
the
lawyer.
those
materials
are
given
to
the
lawyer
to
be
synthesized
as
the
lawyer
sees
it
fit
to
be
communicated
onto
the
government
and
therefore
those
communications
are
not
within
the
attorney-client
privilege.
when
the
information
is
turned
over
to
the
lawyer
for
purposes
of
seeking
his
legal
advice,
i
think
it
is
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
we
had
court
of
appeals
holdings
on
that
point,
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
they
do
sir.
they
are
on
page
18
of
our
brief
at
the
top.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
fifth
amendment,
yes
i
think
there
would
be
a
sixth
amendment
issue,
about
the
attorney-client
privilege.
there
maybe
some
basis
for
the
attorney-client
privilege
when
legal
advice
is
sought
in
the
sixth
amendment,
when
there
has
been
a
confidential
communication
to
the
attorney.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
i
presume.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
might
possibly
be
some
civil
remedy
between
the
accountant
and
his
client
for
breach
of
professional
duty
if
they
are
recognized
by
state
law,
i
think
this
would
be
a
question
of
state
law
and
i
frankly
have
not
looked
into
it.
now
we
have
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief,
on
pages
14
through
16,
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held
that
the
issue
is
not
proprietary,
interest
of
proprietary
rights.
when
a
fifth
amendment
claim
is
raised
with
respect
to
the
compelled
production
of
records
and
the
compulsion
operates
on
a
third
person.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
these
cases
in
various
ways,
but
if
the
distinction
is
really
overlooked
the
rationale
of
the
cases,
which
is
pretty
well
summarized
in
the
quotation
on
page
15
at
the
end
of
the
quotation,
on
the
perlman
case,
where
reliance
was
placed
solely
on
a
claim
of
title,
which
the
court
didn't
even
decide
because
it
considered
unnecessary
to
decide,
because
as
the
court
said,
the
criterion
of
immunity
is
not
the
ownership
of
property
but
the
physical
or
moral
compulsion
exerted.
based
on
the
reasoning
of
the
epigram
of
justice
holmes
in
the
leading
case,
johnson
against
united
states
that
a
party
is
privileged
from
producing
the
evidence,
but
not
from
its
production,
it
is
true
that
in
the
case
involving
the
introduction
of
the
stolen
records
justices
holmes
and
brandeis
dissented
from
the
holding
that
that
dissent
was
not
based
on
the
view
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
have
been
violated
by
the
introduction
of
the
records
and
evidence.
indeed,
it
was
premised
very
explicitly
on
the
proposition
that
no
constitutional
provision
had
been
violated
and
that
they
were
accepting
as
true,
the
majorities
holding
that
the
papers
could
have
been
subpoenaed
from
the
faith.
but,
the
dissenting
opinion
said,
that
there
are
principles
of
decency
and
fair
play
which
lead
them
to
the
conclusion
that
the
evidence
should
not
be
accepted
in
this
case,
for
all
that's
written
in
the
opinion,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
holding,
but
a
rule
of
evidence
in
their
view
that
congress
could
have
overturned.
the
dissent
is
not
at
all
premised
on
the
idea
that
there
had
been
a
fifth
amendment
violation
nor
has
any
other
case
in
this
court
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
violated
when
someone
else
is
compelled
to
produce
evidence
created
by
or
owned
by
the
person
attempting
to
claim
the
privilege
who
is
not
himself
being
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
