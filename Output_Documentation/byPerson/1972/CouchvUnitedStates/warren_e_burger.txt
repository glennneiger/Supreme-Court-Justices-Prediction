against
the
united

mr.
rocovich,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

warren
e.

but
then
when
mr.
justice
holmes
decided
the
tax
returns
were
admissible
and
there
were
a
chain
of
cases
that
had
followed
that
right
up
to
donaldson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
documents
related
to
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
getting
back
to
these
records,
what
about
canceled
checks
that
cover
items
claimed
as
deductions.
will
they
be
privileged?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
they
be
secured
from
the
bank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
specific
canceled
check
of
the
taxpayer
in
the
tax
payer's
handwriting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
that
be
similarly
true
under
the
wage
and
hour
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
you
give
the
miranda
warning
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
through
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
that
this
man
was
an
independent
contractor
who
was
paid
on
a
job
basis.
each
time
he
did
some
work,
he
was
separately
paid.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very,
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
saying
that
the
taxpayer
has
conceded
here
that
this
accountant
could
have
been
called
into
the
courtroom
or
in
pretrial
and
give
testimony
as
to
the
contents
of
all
these
documents,
even
if
the
documents
themselves
couldn't
have
been.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
mr.
rocovich
to
tell
us
that
this
man
was
an
independent
contractor
who
was
paid
on
in
effect
piecework
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
harder
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
you
would
agree
that
if
a
certified
public
accountant
distinguish
him
from
just
some
tax
–
some
fellow
who
makes
tax
return,
if
a
certified
public
accountant
were
to
give
these
private
records
to
a
newspaper
reporter
for
example
then
he
would
be
subject
to
disciplinary
proceedings
within
his
own
profession.
there
is
some
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
sense.
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
certainly
would
be
a
private
matter
first
between
the
principle
and
the
certified
public
accountant
and
then
between
the
certified
public
accountant
and
perhaps
his
professional
organization.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wallace,
do
you
have
anymore
mr.
rocovich?
we
have
about
three
minutes
remaining.
let
me
ask
you
at
the
outset,
suppose
the
taxpayer
here,
your
client
had
been
in
europe
or
some
distant
place,
the
time
the
subpoena
was
served
on
the
accountant
and
the
accountant
is
then
confronted
with
this
situation,
what
kind
of
compulsion
is
there
being
exerted
on
the
taxpayer
herself?
taxpayer
might
not
even
know
about
the
existence
of
the
subpoena.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
isn't
the
thrust
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
compulsion
on
the
principle
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
fourth
amendment
help
you
if
subpoena
summons
were
issued
and
it
was
properly
grounded?
would
that
be
a
reasonable
or
an
unreasonable
search
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
just
getting
into
your
fourth
amendment
argument,
if
there
is
a
valid
warrant
or
a
valid
subpoena,
the
fourth
amendment
probably
goes
away.
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
