mr.
mark
h.
berens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
commerce
clause
case.
the
question
presented
is
whether
illinois
in
conformance
with
that
clause,
may
impose
its
used
tax
on
all
fuel
loaded
by
united
air
lines,
aboard
its
aircraft
about
to
leave
the
chicago
airports
on
interstate
and
foreign
flights.
as
found
by
the
trial
court
and
confirmed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
facts
can
be
stated
very
briefly.
all
of
the
fuel
is
purchased
by
united
from
shell
oil
company
at
shell
oil’s
terminal
in
northern
indiana
at
which
point,
delivery
occurs
and
title
and
risk
of
loss
transfers
from
shell
to
united.
from
there,
united
arranges
transportation
by
common
carriers,
principally
a
pipeline
to
o’hare
and
midway
airports
in
chicago.
the
fuel
is
stored
at
those
airports
on
the
average
from
two
to
six-and-a-half
days
of
which
about
two
days
is
required
to
remove
impurities
secreted
during
the
transportation.
the
fuel
is
then
loaded
into
united’s
aircraft.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
mainly
by
pipeline
for
jet
fuel.
there
are
trucking
operations
to
midway
because
the
volume
is
much
less
there.
now,
the
truck
as
well
as
pipeline
is
common
carrier
and
the
contracts
are
between
those
carriers
and
united.
the
fuel
is
loaded
into
united's
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
a
minimum
of
two,
a
maximum
of
12
days,
the
average
is
two
to
six-and-a-half.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
approximately
two
days
are
required
to
settle
the
fuel
and
filter
it.
the
remainder
of
the
time
is
really
coordinating
transfers
of
the
fuel
--
the
scheduling
of
the
transfer
with
the
flight
operations.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes.
there
are
several
days
on
hand.
they
pump
a
large
amounts,
the
jet
fuel
is
pumped
three
times
a
month
to
o’hare,
the
other
fuel
to
midway
is
carried
by
a
truck
on
almost
a
daily
basis.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
a
great
amount.
there
is
variation
depending
on
its
destination
and
depending
on
how
much
fuel
it
came
in
with.
it
can
range
from,
and
it's
in
poundage
rather
gallons
in
the
air
industry
from
a
couple
thousand
to
60-70,000
lbs
of
fuel.
this
fuel
is
loaded,
almost
always
immediately
just
prior
to
the
departure
of
the
aircraft.
none
other
fuel
involved
in
this
litigation
is
used
locally
or
in
interstate
flights.
now,
these
arrangements
have
been
followed
by
united
continuously
since
1953
two
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
illinois
use
tax
act.
and
they
are
part
of
a
nationwide
contractual
arrangement
between
shell
and
united
which
covers
delivery
at
43
different
points.
for
example,
united
takes
delivery
at
shell’s
northern
indiana
terminal
not
only
for
the
chicago
airports
but
for
other
airports
in
the
midwestern
states.
all
of
the
fuel
loaded
is
as
i
said
earlier
consumed
on
interstate
and
foreign
flights
and
almost
all
of
it
outside
illinois.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
under
the
federal
aviation
regulations,
commercial
carriers
are
required
to
carry
large
amounts
of
reserve
fuel
and
the
land
with
this
reserve
fuel
at
chicago.
now
according
to
the
record,
99.9%
of
the
time
and
it's
this
fuel
that
is
principally
first
consumed
as
the
plane
leaves
the
state
and
keep
in
mind
where
chicago
is
in
illinois,
up
at
the
upper
corner
of
the
state
so
that
the
distance
traversed
on
many
flights,
particularly
east
and
north
bound
over
illinois
is
60
or
less
miles.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
westbound,
it's
about,
it
varies
from
130-216
miles
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well
these
are
all
due
west
on
united’s
pattern.
they
have
only
one
southwest
route
that
is
only
used
in
3/10ths
of
1%
of
the
time.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
although
not
in
the
record,
that's
our
understanding
and
also
airlines
have
served
st.
louis
and
the
southwest
covering
a
great
deal
of
mileage
(inaudible)
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
submit
that
in
part,
it
does,
based
on
the
very
premise
of
the
use
tax
act
and
in
particular
the
illinois
statute
that
i
will
attempt
to
develop.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
no,
i
believe
it
will
apply,
your
honor
to
other
airlines,
but
conceivably
on
a
factual
basis.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
in
that
case,
the
illinois
has
asserted
tax
and
the
airlines
are
paying
the
tax
already
when
that
occurs.
the
united
for
one
has
a
flight
from
moline
to
chicago
where
they
pay
the
use
tax
on
the
amount
loaded
aboard
these
flights.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
it
is
identical
in
that
particular
situation.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
and
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
varies
according
to
the
destinations
and
the
--.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well,
under
the
faa
regulations,
they
are
required
to
carry
what
you
might
and
i
might
think
is
a
great
deal
of
excess.
tens
of
thousands
of
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
this
is
to
make
any
contingency
that
can
be
conceived
of,
even
when
there
is
weather
problems
for
example.
and
they
may
have
to
land
in
another
alternate
airport.
they
schedule
the
fuel
so
that
if
they
do
land
at
the
other
airport,
they
have
the
same
reserve,
that
they
would
have
had
if
they
landed
on
the
originally
scheduled
airport.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
this
is
compelled
by
common
sense,
as
well
as,
the
faa
and
the
cab.
not
only
is
the
fuel
consumed
outside
of
illinois
except
the
minibus
amounts
but
depending
on
the
type
of
the
aircraft,
from
35%-60%
of
the
fuel
loaded
in
chicago
is
actually
consumed
after
the
plane
has
landed
in
another
state
and
is
proceeding
on
the
next
leg
of
it's
interstate
journey.
the
illinois
use
tax
is
a
privileged
tax
imposed
on
the
use
of
tangible
property
in
illinois.
it
is
a
general
revenue
tax
and
its
proceeds
are
not
allocated
to
airport
construction
or
maintenance.
the
act
defines
use
in
the
usual
broad
way
to
include
the
exercise
of
any
right
of
ownership
over
property.
but
the
illinois
act
then
limits
this
definition
by
several
exceptions
intended
according
to
the
explicit
terms
of
the
act
to
prevent
and
i
am
quoting,
“actual
or
likely
multi
state
taxation.”
one
of
these
exceptions
is
the
so-called
temporary
storage
provision,
which
excludes
from
the
concept
of
a
taxable
use,
the
storage
in
illinois
or
property
purchased
outside
the
state
brought
in
by
the
owner
and
then
used
outside
the
state.
the
construction
placed
on
this
provision
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
decision
below
raises
the
serious
commerce
clause
issue
that
is
appealed
to
this
court.
from
1955
when
the
act
was
first
enacted
until
1963,
illinois
sought
only
to
tax
that
portion
of
the
chicago
laden
fuel
that
was
actually
burned
over
illinois
by
the
departing
flights.
this
was
known
as
the
“burn
off”
rule.
and
united
did
not
contest
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax
during
that
period
because
it
considered
it
not
unfair.
in
1963,
the
illinois
department
of
revenue
issued
a
bulletin
which
took
the
position
that
this
stored
fuel
becomes
taxable
and
i
will
quote
the
words
of
the
bulletin,
“when
it
is
placed
into
the
tank
of
an
airplane,
railroad
engine
or
truck,
at
this
point,
the
fuel
is
converted
into
its
ultimate
use
and
therefore
a
taxable
use
occurs
in
illinois.”
the
bulletin
contrasted
this
with
the
situation
where
the
fuel
is
hauled,
as
it
called
it
by
a
separate
facilities,
by
which
it
meant
a
tank
truck
or
a
railroad
tanker
or
a
pipeline,
in
which
case,
the
storage,
the
withdrawal
nor
the
transportation
was
taxable.
in
a
4
to
3
decision
below,
the
illinois
supreme
court
upheld
the
position
taken
by
the
bulletin
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
majority
below
is
composed
of
two
judge
opinions,
a
per
curiam
of
two
judges
and
a
two-judge
concurring
opinion.
there
was
a
three-judge
dissent.
the
concurring
opinion
was
specific
regarding
the
taxable
incident.
it's
said
and
i
am
quoting
again,
“illinois
may
constitutionally
collect
the
tax
imposed
on
all
of
the
fuel
loaded
on
united’s
planes
at
the
airports.”
the
per
curiam
opinion
was
much
more
complex.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
not
on
this
fuel
before
in
this
litigation.
there
is
no
diversion
of
it
whatsoever.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
will
not
answer
that
then.
the
per
curiam
opinion
was
much
more
complex.
first
of
all,
as
a
preliminary
conclusion,
it
held
that
the
“burn
off’
rule
was
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause
citing
helson
and
randolph
v.
kentucky
volume
279
of
this
court’s
reports
and
this
place,
the
per
curiam
judges
in
the
anonymous
position
that
holding
a
tax
on
that
part
of
the
fuel
loaded
at
chicago,
that
was
actually
consumed
in
illinois
was
a
burden
on
the
commerce,
but
that
if
the
state
taxed
all
of
the
fuel
loaded,
even
though
it
was
burned
outside
the
state,
it
was
not
a
burn-off
thereby,
making
a
tax
on
part
more
of
a
burden
than
tax
on
all.
but
returning
to
the
construction
of
the
temporary
storage
provision,
the
court
discussed
three
events
that
applied
to
all
the
fuel,
the
storage,
the
withdrawal
and
the
loading
it
aboard
the
aircraft
and
it
spelled
out
a
distinction.
it
said
that
if
the
fuel
were
removed
from
the
storage
and
taken
by
again,
separate
facilities,
or
as
it
is
expressed
it,
in
a
vehicle
which
does
not
consume
the
fuel,
to
another
state,
neither
the
storage
nor
the
withdrawal
nor
the
loading
onto
that
vehicle,
nor
the
transportation
from
the
state
would
be
subject
to
tax.
it
contrasted
this
with
the
situation
where
the
fuel
is
stored
the
same
way,
withdrawn
in
the
same
way,
but
loaded
on
a
vehicle
which
consumes
it.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
they
were
construing
the
state
law,
which
i
am
taking
time,
your
honor
to
do
because
it's
the
foundation
of
our
argument.
and
in
that
situation
which
was
identical
in
all
respects
to
the
other
except
onto
what
it
was
loaded,
it
found
that
a
taxable
use
occurred.
now
it
attempted
to
relate
the
taxable
use
back
to
the
storage,
but
we
submit
that's
a
non
sequitur
because
the
storage
in
both
instances
is
the
same,
so
is
the
withdrawal.
what
is
decisive
and
is
the
taxable
event,
we
submit,
is
the
loading
onto
the
vehicle
which
consumes
it.
and
thus
the
per
curiam,
the
concurring
opinions
and
the
bulletin
of
the
illinois
department
of
revenue,
all
arrived
in
different
language
at
the
same
point
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
loading
of
the
fuel
onto
the
aircraft.
now
this,
we
believe
takes
us
squarely
into
the
authority
of
michigan-wisconsin
pipe
line
co.
v.
calvert,
volume
357
and
a
number
of
other
cases.
that
case
which
was
an
unanimous
decision
held
that
texas
could
not
impose
a
severance
tax
on
natural
gas
being
transferred
from
our
refinery
pipeline
in
texas
to
an
interstate
pipeline
and
the
court
said
in
part
that
the
tax
that
i
am
quoting
“was
only
taking
off
in
appellant’s
carrier
into
commerce,”
and
in
continuing
“in
reality,
the
tax
therefore
is
on
the
exit
of
the
gas
from
the
state.”
this
economic
process
is
inherently
un-susceptible
to
the
division
into
distinct
local
activity
capable
of
forming
a
basis
for
the
tax
imposed
on
one
hand
and
a
separate
movement
in
commerce
on
the
other,
on
the
board
from
(inaudible)
mr.
mark
h.
berens
that
is
michigan-wisconsin
pipe
line
co.
v.
calvert,
volume
347.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
don't
believe
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
have
said
that
in
light
of
the
statutory
provisions
they
were
construing
which
exempted
the
story.
but
taking
your
question
one
step
further,
if
that
temporary
storage
provision
did
not
exist
in
the
illinois
statute,
we
would
concede
that
the
storage
and
the
withdrawal
could
have
been
taxable
under
the
commerce
clause,
under
edelman
and
nashville
v.
wallace.
it
is
a
statutory
situation
that
makes
the
constitutional
issue
what
it
is.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
hope
to.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
in
michigan-wisconsin,
the
court
cited,
joseph
v.
carter
&
weekes
which
some
years
earlier
had
invalidated
a
new
york
city
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
income
of
a
stevedoring
company
loading
ships
in
new
york
harbor
and
unloading.
and
that
case
stated,
the
carter
&
weekes
and
i
quote
from
page
427,
“transportation
in
commerce
at
the
least
begins
with
loading
and
ends
with
unloading.
loading
and
unloading
has
effect
on
transportation
outside
the
taxing
state
because
those
activities
are
not
only
preliminary
to,
but
are
essential
part
of
the
transportation
itself.”
to
the
same
effect
are
numerous
cases
cited
in
our
brief
and
we
have
found
no
authority
in
the
regulatory
area
or
the
tax
area
there
holds
that
loading
is
not
an
integral
part
of
interstate
transportation.
at
least
in
its
brief
the
state
bases
and
justifies
this
tax
primarily
on
nashville
v.
wallace,
288
u.s.
and
edelman
v.
boeing
air
transport.
in
both
of
those
cases,
i
should
add,
which
respectively
involved
the
taxation
by
tennessee
and
wyoming
of
fuel
that
was
eventually
used
in
an
interstate
rail
system
and
an
interstate
air
carrier.
in
both
of
those
cases,
this
court
accepted
the
construction
of
the
lower
courts
that
the
state
tax
involved
was
on
the
storage
or
at
the
withdrawal
from
the
storage.
and
based
on
that,
this
court
concluded
that
the
taxable
event
was
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
interstate
movement,
prior
to
the
loading.
and
i
emphasize
that
in
both
of
those
states
at
the
time
of
the
litigation,
there
was
nothing
resembling
a
temporary
storage
provision
as
exists
in
illinois,
making
the
statutory
situation
fundamentally
different
in
our
opinion.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
it
certainly
did,
your
honor,
and
looking
at
the
briefs
and
the
record
in
the
library
here,
there
was
no
evidence
that
counsel
for
either
side
eluded
to
that
to
this
court.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
don't
know
if
it's
meaningless,
your
honor,
but
i
do
submit
that
it
had
not
been
pressed
to
this
court
as
a
provision
that
was
relevant
in
the
statute.
or
if
it
had
been,
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
the
court
in
edelman
may
have
distinguished
the
case
a
year
earlier
that
is
the
wallace
case.
but
the
court
in
this
case
specifically
said
that
the
statute
here
construed
is
identical
to
that
construed
in
the
wallace
case.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
unfortunately,
we
are
confronted
with
that
exemption
in
the
edelman
situation.
it
did
not
seem
to
be
considered
in
--
by
the
court
in
its
consideration.
if
it
had,
i
would
have
thought
edelman
would
have
come
up
the
same
way
we
are
urging
the
court
to
come
out
in
this
situation.
that
because
of
the
export
provision,
there
couldn't
be
any
tax,
but
also
i
may
add
in
the
edelman,
that
seems
to
have
been
a
mistake
in
applying
the
statute
rather
than
a
constitutional
issue.
the
state
also
relies
on
southern
pacific
co.
v.
gallagher
which
together
with
the
other
two
cases
i
just
mentioned,
is
specifically
distinguished
by
carter
&
weekes
at
330
u.s.
432
(inaudible).
in
both
michigan-wisconsin
and
carter
&
weekes,
this
court
has
stated
that
where
the
tax
is
an
integral
part
of
the
transportation,
it's
not
necessary
to
show
multi-state
taxation,
but
that
the
mere
possibility
is
sufficient.
here
we
have
actual
multi-state
taxation.
the
fuel
purchased
from
shell
is
subject
to
indiana
gross
income
tax
measured
by
the
sale
price
to
united.
a
few
days
later,
illinois
would
subject
the
same
fuel
to
its
use
tax,
based
on
the
same
sales
price.
in
addition,
as
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
a
potentiality
of
states
down
stream
taxing
the
same
fuel
in
situations
where
a
flight
lands,
let
us
say
in
dayton,
ohio
and
then
proceeds
to
columbus
where
there
is
a
segment
within
the
state.
this
applies
to
roughly
one
out
of
five
of
united’s
departures.
we
don't
want
to
rely
entirely
on
authority,
but
we
like
to
relate
to
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
and
i
think
this
was
well
stated
in
the
carter
&
weekes
case
at
the
very
end.
not
only
do
these
precedents
outlaw
taxes,
but
it
has
reason
to
support
such
outlawing
in
the
likelihood
that
legislation
will
flourish
more
luxuriantly,
where
most
revenue
will
come
from
foreign
and
interstate
commerce,
thus
in
port
cities
and
transportation
or
handling
centers,
without
discrimination
against
out
of
state
as
compared
with
local
business,
larger
proportions
of
necessary
revenue
could
be
obtained
from
the
flow
of
commerce.
the
avoidance
of
such
a
toll
on
the
passage
of
commerce
through
a
locality
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
adoption
of
the
commerce
clause.
now,
we
view
this
as
a
toll,
not
in
a
classical
sense,
but
if
you
look
at
the
use
tax
as
the
privilege
of
enjoined
property,
the
enjoinment
of
consumable
goods
such
as
fuel
is
in
its
consumption,
not
on
its
storage,
but
only
a
very
small
fraction
of
this
fuel
is
actually
consumed
in
illinois
and
that
only
in
about
less
than
4%
of
the
departing
flights
of
united.
the
rest
is
burned
outside
illinois
and
much
of
it
in
other
states.
if
you
strip
this,
it's
formalism,
illinois
then
seeks
to
impose
a
toll
on
fuel
purchased
outside
of
the
state
temporarily
stored
here
only
in
the
words
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
facilitate
united's
interstate
operations
from
chicago.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes,
and
i
that
was
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
it
was
inadvertent.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
the
quote
of
the
court
was,
on
its
operations
from
the
chicago
airports,
the
word
interstate
was
not
in
there.
i
think
in
the
brief
we
have
frequently
said,
built
on
its
interstate
operations
but
i
don't
believe
we
have
quoted
it
if
that
was
the
import
of
your
comment,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes,
we
always
have.
that
is
not
part
of
this
assessment
or
part
of
this
case.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well,
i
think
the
formalism
supported
by
considerable
line
of
authority
in
this
court
such
as
the
spector
case,
the
dilworth
versus
mccloud
and
many
others
which
set
the
means
by
which
the
state
and
freeman
v.
hewitt
imposes
its
taxes
decisive.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
don't
think
we
can
reconcile
all
of
them.
we
can
certainly
reconcile
most.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
understood
it
was
300
but
–
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well,
unfortunately,
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
reconcile
that
many.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
would
distinguish
evansville
on
the
basis
that
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well,
i
have
to
make
one
clarification
mr.
justice
brennan.
none
of
the
flights
departing
chicago
are
intrastate
flights
of
united.
while
they
do
stop
at
moline,
they
are
continuing
flights
to
points
outside
the
state.
that
is
in
the
states
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
pay
the
tax
on
it,
but
we
have
done
it
as
a
volunteer
for
many
years.
we
do
not
think
those
are
interstate
flights.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
with
the
lower
court
cases
in
evansville
was
also
after
that.
we
distinguish
evansville
very
briefly
on
the
fact
that
the
landing
fees
and
other
fees
that
united
pays
and
the
other
airlines
pay
at
the
chicago
airports
are
fully
compensatory
not
only
for
the
maintenance
of
the
airports
and
operations,
but
also
it
repays
the
financial
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
but
the
airport
is
operating
apparently
at
a
deficit
as
i
read
the
opinion
and
this
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
as
i
read
those
cases
or
at
least
your
opinion
of
those
cases
not
the
lower
courts,
they
still
were
not
fully
compensatory,
that
additional
funds
were
needed
and
this
contributed
to
them,
and
in
fact
as
i
recall
your
opinion,
you
pointed
out
that
as
long
as
the
amounts
for
the
head
taxes
do
not
exceed
by
gross
margin,
the
deficit
that
would
be
treated
as
a
service
that
the
state
was
providing
was
being
paid
by
these
head
taxes.
i
would
like
to
also
mention
very
briefly
the
cases
--
and
line
of
cases
cited
by
the
amicus
brief,
so
called
stream
of
commerce
cases
which
points
out
that
the
fuel
here
is
committed
from
the
time
not
just
when
it
is
stored
in
illinois
but
at
at
the
time
it
is
brought
up
as
jet
fuel
to
northern
indiana
to
interstate
commerce
and
that
it
is
brought
from
indiana
through
illinois,
stored
there
temporarily
only
for
the
exigencies
of
united
interstate
operation,
and
then
it
is
taken
from
the
--
most
of
it
is
taken
--
almost
all
of
it
has
taken
from
the
state
and
consumed
elsewhere.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
if
the
stream
of
commerce
cases
preclude
the
property
taxes
on
goods
moving
in
commerce
which
are
assessed
only
once
a
year,
it
seems
even
more
essential
that
they
can
be
construed
liberally
as
this
court
has
indicated
on
several
occasions
including
richfield
oil
to
preclude
a
tax
on
the
flow
everyday
of
the
year
which
would
be
the
situation
here.
one
possible
approach
of
course
is
“burn
off”
and
while
we
believe
the
situation
is
controlled
by
michigan
wisconsin
and
if
the
loading
is
exempted
it
cannot
be
taxed.
examples
in
recent
years
such
as
northwestern
portland
cement
and
general
motors
versus
washington
have
approved
a
portion
taxes
on
net
and
gross
income
from
interstate
transactions.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
do
not
think
mr.
chief
justice,
you
have
to
construe
the
statute
that
way.
as
a
constitutional
matter,
you
can
say
that
this
is
permissible,
and
we
have
the
situation
where
the
lower
court
seem
to
construe
the
statute
the
way
it
did
or
at
least
two
of
the
four
judge
majority
did
because
they
thought
“burn
off’
was
constitutionally
impermissible,
and
so
they
had
to
go
for
the
decision
which
yielded
the
full
text
or
none
at
all.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
commerce
clause
case.
the
question
presented
is
whether
illinois
in
conformance
with
that
clause,
may
impose
its
used
tax
on
all
fuel
loaded
by
united
air
lines,
aboard
its
aircraft
about
to
leave
the
chicago
airports
on
interstate
and
foreign
flights.
as
found
by
the
trial
court
and
confirmed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
facts
can
be
stated
very
briefly.
all
of
the
fuel
is
purchased
by
united
from
shell
oil
company
at
shell
oil’s
terminal
in
northern
indiana
at
which
point,
delivery
occurs
and
title
and
risk
of
loss
transfers
from
shell
to
united.
from
there,
united
arranges
transportation
by
common
carriers,
principally
a
pipeline
to
o’hare
and
midway
airports
in
chicago.
the
fuel
is
stored
at
those
airports
on
the
average
from
two
to
six-and-a-half
days
of
which
about
two
days
is
required
to
remove
impurities
secreted
during
the
transportation.
the
fuel
is
then
loaded
into
united’s
aircraft.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
mainly
by
pipeline
for
jet
fuel.
there
are
trucking
operations
to
midway
because
the
volume
is
much
less
there.
now,
the
truck
as
well
as
pipeline
is
common
carrier
and
the
contracts
are
between
those
carriers
and
united.
the
fuel
is
loaded
into
united's
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
a
minimum
of
two,
a
maximum
of
12
days,
the
average
is
two
to
six-and-a-half.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
approximately
two
days
are
required
to
settle
the
fuel
and
filter
it.
the
remainder
of
the
time
is
really
coordinating
transfers
of
the
fuel
--
the
scheduling
of
the
transfer
with
the
flight
operations.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes.
there
are
several
days
on
hand.
they
pump
a
large
amounts,
the
jet
fuel
is
pumped
three
times
a
month
to
o’hare,
the
other
fuel
to
midway
is
carried
by
a
truck
on
almost
a
daily
basis.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
a
great
amount.
there
is
variation
depending
on
its
destination
and
depending
on
how
much
fuel
it
came
in
with.
it
can
range
from,
and
it's
in
poundage
rather
gallons
in
the
air
industry
from
a
couple
thousand
to
60-70,000
lbs
of
fuel.
this
fuel
is
loaded,
almost
always
immediately
just
prior
to
the
departure
of
the
aircraft.
none
other
fuel
involved
in
this
litigation
is
used
locally
or
in
interstate
flights.
now,
these
arrangements
have
been
followed
by
united
continuously
since
1953
two
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
illinois
use
tax
act.
and
they
are
part
of
a
nationwide
contractual
arrangement
between
shell
and
united
which
covers
delivery
at
43
different
points.
for
example,
united
takes
delivery
at
shell’s
northern
indiana
terminal
not
only
for
the
chicago
airports
but
for
other
airports
in
the
midwestern
states.
all
of
the
fuel
loaded
is
as
i
said
earlier
consumed
on
interstate
and
foreign
flights
and
almost
all
of
it
outside
illinois.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
under
the
federal
aviation
regulations,
commercial
carriers
are
required
to
carry
large
amounts
of
reserve
fuel
and
the
land
with
this
reserve
fuel
at
chicago.
now
according
to
the
record,
99.9%
of
the
time
and
it's
this
fuel
that
is
principally
first
consumed
as
the
plane
leaves
the
state
and
keep
in
mind
where
chicago
is
in
illinois,
up
at
the
upper
corner
of
the
state
so
that
the
distance
traversed
on
many
flights,
particularly
east
and
north
bound
over
illinois
is
60
or
less
miles.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
westbound,
it's
about,
it
varies
from
130-216
miles
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well
these
are
all
due
west
on
united’s
pattern.
they
have
only
one
southwest
route
that
is
only
used
in
3/10ths
of
1%
of
the
time.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
although
not
in
the
record,
that's
our
understanding
and
also
airlines
have
served
st.
louis
and
the
southwest
covering
a
great
deal
of
mileage
(inaudible)
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
submit
that
in
part,
it
does,
based
on
the
very
premise
of
the
use
tax
act
and
in
particular
the
illinois
statute
that
i
will
attempt
to
develop.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
no,
i
believe
it
will
apply,
your
honor
to
other
airlines,
but
conceivably
on
a
factual
basis.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
in
that
case,
the
illinois
has
asserted
tax
and
the
airlines
are
paying
the
tax
already
when
that
occurs.
the
united
for
one
has
a
flight
from
moline
to
chicago
where
they
pay
the
use
tax
on
the
amount
loaded
aboard
these
flights.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
it
is
identical
in
that
particular
situation.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
and
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
varies
according
to
the
destinations
and
the
--.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well,
under
the
faa
regulations,
they
are
required
to
carry
what
you
might
and
i
might
think
is
a
great
deal
of
excess.
tens
of
thousands
of
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
this
is
to
make
any
contingency
that
can
be
conceived
of,
even
when
there
is
weather
problems
for
example.
and
they
may
have
to
land
in
another
alternate
airport.
they
schedule
the
fuel
so
that
if
they
do
land
at
the
other
airport,
they
have
the
same
reserve,
that
they
would
have
had
if
they
landed
on
the
originally
scheduled
airport.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
this
is
compelled
by
common
sense,
as
well
as,
the
faa
and
the
cab.
not
only
is
the
fuel
consumed
outside
of
illinois
except
the
minibus
amounts
but
depending
on
the
type
of
the
aircraft,
from
35%-60%
of
the
fuel
loaded
in
chicago
is
actually
consumed
after
the
plane
has
landed
in
another
state
and
is
proceeding
on
the
next
leg
of
it's
interstate
journey.
the
illinois
use
tax
is
a
privileged
tax
imposed
on
the
use
of
tangible
property
in
illinois.
it
is
a
general
revenue
tax
and
its
proceeds
are
not
allocated
to
airport
construction
or
maintenance.
the
act
defines
use
in
the
usual
broad
way
to
include
the
exercise
of
any
right
of
ownership
over
property.
but
the
illinois
act
then
limits
this
definition
by
several
exceptions
intended
according
to
the
explicit
terms
of
the
act
to
prevent
and
i
am
quoting,
“actual
or
likely
multi
state
taxation.”
one
of
these
exceptions
is
the
so-called
temporary
storage
provision,
which
excludes
from
the
concept
of
a
taxable
use,
the
storage
in
illinois
or
property
purchased
outside
the
state
brought
in
by
the
owner
and
then
used
outside
the
state.
the
construction
placed
on
this
provision
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
decision
below
raises
the
serious
commerce
clause
issue
that
is
appealed
to
this
court.
from
1955
when
the
act
was
first
enacted
until
1963,
illinois
sought
only
to
tax
that
portion
of
the
chicago
laden
fuel
that
was
actually
burned
over
illinois
by
the
departing
flights.
this
was
known
as
the
“burn
off”
rule.
and
united
did
not
contest
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax
during
that
period
because
it
considered
it
not
unfair.
in
1963,
the
illinois
department
of
revenue
issued
a
bulletin
which
took
the
position
that
this
stored
fuel
becomes
taxable
and
i
will
quote
the
words
of
the
bulletin,
“when
it
is
placed
into
the
tank
of
an
airplane,
railroad
engine
or
truck,
at
this
point,
the
fuel
is
converted
into
its
ultimate
use
and
therefore
a
taxable
use
occurs
in
illinois.”
the
bulletin
contrasted
this
with
the
situation
where
the
fuel
is
hauled,
as
it
called
it
by
a
separate
facilities,
by
which
it
meant
a
tank
truck
or
a
railroad
tanker
or
a
pipeline,
in
which
case,
the
storage,
the
withdrawal
nor
the
transportation
was
taxable.
in
a
4
to
3
decision
below,
the
illinois
supreme
court
upheld
the
position
taken
by
the
bulletin
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
majority
below
is
composed
of
two
judge
opinions,
a
per
curiam
of
two
judges
and
a
two-judge
concurring
opinion.
there
was
a
three-judge
dissent.
the
concurring
opinion
was
specific
regarding
the
taxable
incident.
it's
said
and
i
am
quoting
again,
“illinois
may
constitutionally
collect
the
tax
imposed
on
all
of
the
fuel
loaded
on
united’s
planes
at
the
airports.”
the
per
curiam
opinion
was
much
more
complex.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
not
on
this
fuel
before
in
this
litigation.
there
is
no
diversion
of
it
whatsoever.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
will
not
answer
that
then.
the
per
curiam
opinion
was
much
more
complex.
first
of
all,
as
a
preliminary
conclusion,
it
held
that
the
“burn
off’
rule
was
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause
citing
helson
and
randolph
v.
kentucky
volume
279
of
this
court’s
reports
and
this
place,
the
per
curiam
judges
in
the
anonymous
position
that
holding
a
tax
on
that
part
of
the
fuel
loaded
at
chicago,
that
was
actually
consumed
in
illinois
was
a
burden
on
the
commerce,
but
that
if
the
state
taxed
all
of
the
fuel
loaded,
even
though
it
was
burned
outside
the
state,
it
was
not
a
burn-off
thereby,
making
a
tax
on
part
more
of
a
burden
than
tax
on
all.
but
returning
to
the
construction
of
the
temporary
storage
provision,
the
court
discussed
three
events
that
applied
to
all
the
fuel,
the
storage,
the
withdrawal
and
the
loading
it
aboard
the
aircraft
and
it
spelled
out
a
distinction.
it
said
that
if
the
fuel
were
removed
from
the
storage
and
taken
by
again,
separate
facilities,
or
as
it
is
expressed
it,
in
a
vehicle
which
does
not
consume
the
fuel,
to
another
state,
neither
the
storage
nor
the
withdrawal
nor
the
loading
onto
that
vehicle,
nor
the
transportation
from
the
state
would
be
subject
to
tax.
it
contrasted
this
with
the
situation
where
the
fuel
is
stored
the
same
way,
withdrawn
in
the
same
way,
but
loaded
on
a
vehicle
which
consumes
it.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
they
were
construing
the
state
law,
which
i
am
taking
time,
your
honor
to
do
because
it's
the
foundation
of
our
argument.
and
in
that
situation
which
was
identical
in
all
respects
to
the
other
except
onto
what
it
was
loaded,
it
found
that
a
taxable
use
occurred.
now
it
attempted
to
relate
the
taxable
use
back
to
the
storage,
but
we
submit
that's
a
non
sequitur
because
the
storage
in
both
instances
is
the
same,
so
is
the
withdrawal.
what
is
decisive
and
is
the
taxable
event,
we
submit,
is
the
loading
onto
the
vehicle
which
consumes
it.
and
thus
the
per
curiam,
the
concurring
opinions
and
the
bulletin
of
the
illinois
department
of
revenue,
all
arrived
in
different
language
at
the
same
point
that
the
taxable
event
is
the
loading
of
the
fuel
onto
the
aircraft.
now
this,
we
believe
takes
us
squarely
into
the
authority
of
michigan-wisconsin
pipe
line
co.
v.
calvert,
volume
357
and
a
number
of
other
cases.
that
case
which
was
an
unanimous
decision
held
that
texas
could
not
impose
a
severance
tax
on
natural
gas
being
transferred
from
our
refinery
pipeline
in
texas
to
an
interstate
pipeline
and
the
court
said
in
part
that
the
tax
that
i
am
quoting
“was
only
taking
off
in
appellant’s
carrier
into
commerce,”
and
in
continuing
“in
reality,
the
tax
therefore
is
on
the
exit
of
the
gas
from
the
state.”
this
economic
process
is
inherently
un-susceptible
to
the
division
into
distinct
local
activity
capable
of
forming
a
basis
for
the
tax
imposed
on
one
hand
and
a
separate
movement
in
commerce
on
the
other,
on
the
board
from
(inaudible)
mr.
mark
h.
berens
that
is
michigan-wisconsin
pipe
line
co.
v.
calvert,
volume
347.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
don't
believe
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
have
said
that
in
light
of
the
statutory
provisions
they
were
construing
which
exempted
the
story.
but
taking
your
question
one
step
further,
if
that
temporary
storage
provision
did
not
exist
in
the
illinois
statute,
we
would
concede
that
the
storage
and
the
withdrawal
could
have
been
taxable
under
the
commerce
clause,
under
edelman
and
nashville
v.
wallace.
it
is
a
statutory
situation
that
makes
the
constitutional
issue
what
it
is.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
hope
to.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
in
michigan-wisconsin,
the
court
cited,
joseph
v.
carter
&
weekes
which
some
years
earlier
had
invalidated
a
new
york
city
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
income
of
a
stevedoring
company
loading
ships
in
new
york
harbor
and
unloading.
and
that
case
stated,
the
carter
&
weekes
and
i
quote
from
page
427,
“transportation
in
commerce
at
the
least
begins
with
loading
and
ends
with
unloading.
loading
and
unloading
has
effect
on
transportation
outside
the
taxing
state
because
those
activities
are
not
only
preliminary
to,
but
are
essential
part
of
the
transportation
itself.”
to
the
same
effect
are
numerous
cases
cited
in
our
brief
and
we
have
found
no
authority
in
the
regulatory
area
or
the
tax
area
there
holds
that
loading
is
not
an
integral
part
of
interstate
transportation.
at
least
in
its
brief
the
state
bases
and
justifies
this
tax
primarily
on
nashville
v.
wallace,
288
u.s.
and
edelman
v.
boeing
air
transport.
in
both
of
those
cases,
i
should
add,
which
respectively
involved
the
taxation
by
tennessee
and
wyoming
of
fuel
that
was
eventually
used
in
an
interstate
rail
system
and
an
interstate
air
carrier.
in
both
of
those
cases,
this
court
accepted
the
construction
of
the
lower
courts
that
the
state
tax
involved
was
on
the
storage
or
at
the
withdrawal
from
the
storage.
and
based
on
that,
this
court
concluded
that
the
taxable
event
was
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
interstate
movement,
prior
to
the
loading.
and
i
emphasize
that
in
both
of
those
states
at
the
time
of
the
litigation,
there
was
nothing
resembling
a
temporary
storage
provision
as
exists
in
illinois,
making
the
statutory
situation
fundamentally
different
in
our
opinion.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
it
certainly
did,
your
honor,
and
looking
at
the
briefs
and
the
record
in
the
library
here,
there
was
no
evidence
that
counsel
for
either
side
eluded
to
that
to
this
court.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
don't
know
if
it's
meaningless,
your
honor,
but
i
do
submit
that
it
had
not
been
pressed
to
this
court
as
a
provision
that
was
relevant
in
the
statute.
or
if
it
had
been,
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
the
court
in
edelman
may
have
distinguished
the
case
a
year
earlier
that
is
the
wallace
case.
but
the
court
in
this
case
specifically
said
that
the
statute
here
construed
is
identical
to
that
construed
in
the
wallace
case.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
unfortunately,
we
are
confronted
with
that
exemption
in
the
edelman
situation.
it
did
not
seem
to
be
considered
in
--
by
the
court
in
its
consideration.
if
it
had,
i
would
have
thought
edelman
would
have
come
up
the
same
way
we
are
urging
the
court
to
come
out
in
this
situation.
that
because
of
the
export
provision,
there
couldn't
be
any
tax,
but
also
i
may
add
in
the
edelman,
that
seems
to
have
been
a
mistake
in
applying
the
statute
rather
than
a
constitutional
issue.
the
state
also
relies
on
southern
pacific
co.
v.
gallagher
which
together
with
the
other
two
cases
i
just
mentioned,
is
specifically
distinguished
by
carter
&
weekes
at
330
u.s.
432
(inaudible).
in
both
michigan-wisconsin
and
carter
&
weekes,
this
court
has
stated
that
where
the
tax
is
an
integral
part
of
the
transportation,
it's
not
necessary
to
show
multi-state
taxation,
but
that
the
mere
possibility
is
sufficient.
here
we
have
actual
multi-state
taxation.
the
fuel
purchased
from
shell
is
subject
to
indiana
gross
income
tax
measured
by
the
sale
price
to
united.
a
few
days
later,
illinois
would
subject
the
same
fuel
to
its
use
tax,
based
on
the
same
sales
price.
in
addition,
as
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
a
potentiality
of
states
down
stream
taxing
the
same
fuel
in
situations
where
a
flight
lands,
let
us
say
in
dayton,
ohio
and
then
proceeds
to
columbus
where
there
is
a
segment
within
the
state.
this
applies
to
roughly
one
out
of
five
of
united’s
departures.
we
don't
want
to
rely
entirely
on
authority,
but
we
like
to
relate
to
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
and
i
think
this
was
well
stated
in
the
carter
&
weekes
case
at
the
very
end.
not
only
do
these
precedents
outlaw
taxes,
but
it
has
reason
to
support
such
outlawing
in
the
likelihood
that
legislation
will
flourish
more
luxuriantly,
where
most
revenue
will
come
from
foreign
and
interstate
commerce,
thus
in
port
cities
and
transportation
or
handling
centers,
without
discrimination
against
out
of
state
as
compared
with
local
business,
larger
proportions
of
necessary
revenue
could
be
obtained
from
the
flow
of
commerce.
the
avoidance
of
such
a
toll
on
the
passage
of
commerce
through
a
locality
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
adoption
of
the
commerce
clause.
now,
we
view
this
as
a
toll,
not
in
a
classical
sense,
but
if
you
look
at
the
use
tax
as
the
privilege
of
enjoined
property,
the
enjoinment
of
consumable
goods
such
as
fuel
is
in
its
consumption,
not
on
its
storage,
but
only
a
very
small
fraction
of
this
fuel
is
actually
consumed
in
illinois
and
that
only
in
about
less
than
4%
of
the
departing
flights
of
united.
the
rest
is
burned
outside
illinois
and
much
of
it
in
other
states.
if
you
strip
this,
it's
formalism,
illinois
then
seeks
to
impose
a
toll
on
fuel
purchased
outside
of
the
state
temporarily
stored
here
only
in
the
words
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
facilitate
united's
interstate
operations
from
chicago.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes,
and
i
that
was
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
it
was
inadvertent.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
the
quote
of
the
court
was,
on
its
operations
from
the
chicago
airports,
the
word
interstate
was
not
in
there.
i
think
in
the
brief
we
have
frequently
said,
built
on
its
interstate
operations
but
i
don't
believe
we
have
quoted
it
if
that
was
the
import
of
your
comment,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes,
we
always
have.
that
is
not
part
of
this
assessment
or
part
of
this
case.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well,
i
think
the
formalism
supported
by
considerable
line
of
authority
in
this
court
such
as
the
spector
case,
the
dilworth
versus
mccloud
and
many
others
which
set
the
means
by
which
the
state
and
freeman
v.
hewitt
imposes
its
taxes
decisive.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
don't
think
we
can
reconcile
all
of
them.
we
can
certainly
reconcile
most.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
understood
it
was
300
but
–
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well,
unfortunately,
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
reconcile
that
many.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
would
distinguish
evansville
on
the
basis
that
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well,
i
have
to
make
one
clarification
mr.
justice
brennan.
none
of
the
flights
departing
chicago
are
intrastate
flights
of
united.
while
they
do
stop
at
moline,
they
are
continuing
flights
to
points
outside
the
state.
that
is
in
the
states
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
pay
the
tax
on
it,
but
we
have
done
it
as
a
volunteer
for
many
years.
we
do
not
think
those
are
interstate
flights.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
with
the
lower
court
cases
in
evansville
was
also
after
that.
we
distinguish
evansville
very
briefly
on
the
fact
that
the
landing
fees
and
other
fees
that
united
pays
and
the
other
airlines
pay
at
the
chicago
airports
are
fully
compensatory
not
only
for
the
maintenance
of
the
airports
and
operations,
but
also
it
repays
the
financial
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
but
the
airport
is
operating
apparently
at
a
deficit
as
i
read
the
opinion
and
this
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
as
i
read
those
cases
or
at
least
your
opinion
of
those
cases
not
the
lower
courts,
they
still
were
not
fully
compensatory,
that
additional
funds
were
needed
and
this
contributed
to
them,
and
in
fact
as
i
recall
your
opinion,
you
pointed
out
that
as
long
as
the
amounts
for
the
head
taxes
do
not
exceed
by
gross
margin,
the
deficit
that
would
be
treated
as
a
service
that
the
state
was
providing
was
being
paid
by
these
head
taxes.
i
would
like
to
also
mention
very
briefly
the
cases
--
and
line
of
cases
cited
by
the
amicus
brief,
so
called
stream
of
commerce
cases
which
points
out
that
the
fuel
here
is
committed
from
the
time
not
just
when
it
is
stored
in
illinois
but
at
at
the
time
it
is
brought
up
as
jet
fuel
to
northern
indiana
to
interstate
commerce
and
that
it
is
brought
from
indiana
through
illinois,
stored
there
temporarily
only
for
the
exigencies
of
united
interstate
operation,
and
then
it
is
taken
from
the
--
most
of
it
is
taken
--
almost
all
of
it
has
taken
from
the
state
and
consumed
elsewhere.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
if
the
stream
of
commerce
cases
preclude
the
property
taxes
on
goods
moving
in
commerce
which
are
assessed
only
once
a
year,
it
seems
even
more
essential
that
they
can
be
construed
liberally
as
this
court
has
indicated
on
several
occasions
including
richfield
oil
to
preclude
a
tax
on
the
flow
everyday
of
the
year
which
would
be
the
situation
here.
one
possible
approach
of
course
is
“burn
off”
and
while
we
believe
the
situation
is
controlled
by
michigan
wisconsin
and
if
the
loading
is
exempted
it
cannot
be
taxed.
examples
in
recent
years
such
as
northwestern
portland
cement
and
general
motors
versus
washington
have
approved
a
portion
taxes
on
net
and
gross
income
from
interstate
transactions.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
do
not
think
mr.
chief
justice,
you
have
to
construe
the
statute
that
way.
as
a
constitutional
matter,
you
can
say
that
this
is
permissible,
and
we
have
the
situation
where
the
lower
court
seem
to
construe
the
statute
the
way
it
did
or
at
least
two
of
the
four
judge
majority
did
because
they
thought
“burn
off’
was
constitutionally
impermissible,
and
so
they
had
to
go
for
the
decision
which
yielded
the
full
text
or
none
at
all.
