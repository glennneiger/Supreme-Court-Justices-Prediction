justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
you
have
mentioned
edelman,
you
are
going
to
distinguish
that
case
somewhere?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yet
the
edelman
had
an
exemption
for
gasoline
exported
or
sold
for
exportation
from
the
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
i
imply
from
that,
that's
meaningless
in
the
edelman
statute
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we
don't
relate
it
to
the
temporary
storage
exemption
in
your
illinois
structure.
we
don't
relate
the
edelman
exemption.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
now
there
let
me
interrupt,
when
you
said
only
to
facilitate
united
interstate
operations,
you
are
inserting
in
the
word
“interstate”
from
the
quotation
of
the
illinois
court,
are
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
what
authority
are
you
doing
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
done
it
more
than
once,
i
think
in
your
brief.
i
thought
you
built
an
argument
on
this
inadvertent
insertion,
but
it
is
inadvertent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
also
store
this
fuel
in
relation
to
your
intrastate
flights,
do
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
said
you
also
store
this
fuel
and
pay
tax
in
relation
to
your
intrastate
flights?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
realize
that,
but
your
insertion
of
the
word
interstate
in
the
quotation,
i
think,
is
confusing
in
view
of
that
fact.
i
can
leave
it
to
counsel
to
comment
on
that
and
see
what
they
have
to
say
by
way
of
elimination.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
are
waiting
on
the
result
here.
american
has
(inaudible)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
your
position
that
edelman
controls
this
case,
your
case?
