mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
before
this
court
is
whether
united
airlines
exercise
such
a
right
or
power
over
tangible
property,
in
this
case,
it
is
aviation
fuel.
incident
of
the
ownership
of
that
property
in
illinois,
so
as
to
subject
united
to
the
provisions
of
the
illinois
use
tax.
whether
or
not
the
imposition
of
this
tax
is
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
set
forth
in
article
i,
section
8,
clause
3
of
the
constitution,
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
illinois
use
tax
which
went
into
effect
in
august
of
1955,
imposes
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
using
in
the
state
of
illinois
tangible
personal
property
that
was
purchased
elsewhere
and
was
designed
to
compliment
the
retailer's
occupational
tax
under
which
a
tax
is
imposed
upon
person’s
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
tangible
personal
property
to
purchasers
for
use
and
consumption.
now
both
of
these
statues,
the
illinois
use
tax
and
the
illinois
retailer's
occupation
tax
have
both
been
found
to
be
constitutional.
the
use
tax
act
of
illinois
was
enacted
for
the
valid
purposes
of
preventing
evasion
of
the
retailer's
occupational
tax
by
persons
making
out
of
state
purchases
of
tangible
personal
property
for
use
in
the
illinois,
and
also
the
additional
purpose
of
protecting
illinois
merchants
against
diversion
of
businesses.
shell
oil
company
in
this
case
refines
its
turbine
fuel
and
its
refineries
in
wood
river,
illinois,
then
transfers
it
via
pipelines
250
miles
to
storage
facilities
in
hammond
and
east
chicago,
indiana
for
storage.
both
hammond
and
east
chicago,
indiana
are
south
suburbs
of
the
city
of
chicago
and
no
further
processing
occurs
at
shell’s
facilities,
merely
the
filtering
necessitated
by
the
pipeline
transfer.
united
air
lines
purchase
this
aviation
from
fuel.
united
sends
its
orders
into
shell's
office
in
east
chicago,
indiana,
takes
delivery
in
indiana,
and
transfers
the
aviation
fuel
via
a
common
carrier
pipeline,
to
the
storage
tanks
in
des
plaines,
illinois
which
is
a
northwest
suburb
of
the
city
of
chicago
just
adjacent
to
o’hare
airport.
the
storage
tanks
in
des
plaines
are
owned
by
shell
oil
company,
but
are
leased
to
united
and
to
american,
where
gas
owned
by
both
companies
is
commingled.
the
aviation
fuel
is
allowed
to
settle
in
storage
tanks
in
des
plaines,
illinois
before
it
is
transferred
again
by
pipeline
owned
by
shell
but
leased
to
united,
united’s
o’hare
airport
underground
facilities.
these
underground
tank
service
the
jet
aircraft,
before
they
embark
from
o’hare.
the
delivery
of
the
gasoline
to
chicago’s
midway
airport
is
via
common
carrier
tanks,
trucks
from
shell’s
indiana
facilities
to
the
midway
airport.
now,
all
aviation
fuel
that
is
ultimately
pumped
into
united's
aircraft
at
either
o’hare
or
at
midway
and
that
is
subject
to
the
present
litigation
is
either
refined
and/or
stored
by
shell
at
wood
river,
illinois
facilities
prior
to
its
transfer
to
hammond
and
east
chicago.
now
shell
claims
that
it
pays
an
income
tax
based
on
one
half
of
one
percent
of
its
gross
sales
in
indiana,
but
shell
pays
no
sales
tax
or
retail
occupation
tax
to
the
state
of
indiana,
or
to
the
state
of
illinois.
united
does
not
pay
any
sales
tax
or
use
tax
in
any
state
other
than
the
illinois
on
the
purchase
of
the
fuel
involved
in
this
controversy.
from
august,
1955
until
june
3rd,
1963,
united
paid
to
the
state
of
illinois
without
protest
a
use
tax
on
this
fuel
purchase,
delivery
and
storage
on
that
portion
of
the
fuel
deemed
to
have
been
used
or
consumed
within
the
borders
of
illinois
on
flights
departing
from
midway
and
o’hare
to
points
outside
of
illinois.
the
advantage
of
this
“burn
off”
theory
is
that
in
many
instances
it
would
make
united
subject
only
to
a
use
tax
on
the
10-15
mile
trip
from
o’hare
to
lake
michigan.
then
as
now,
illinois's
use
tax
was
imposed
upon
the
privilege
of
using
in
illinois,
tangible
personal
property
which
is
purchased
at
retail.
now
use
as
is
defined
in
the
illinois
statute,
is
defined
“exercise
by
any
person
of
any
right
or
power
over
tangible
personal
property
incident
to
the
ownership
of
that
property.”
now,
section
3
of
the
illinois
use
tax
from
its
inception
in
1955
has
provided
for
exemptions
from
the
payment
of
that
tax
and
we
recite
these
in
our
brief.
there
are
quite
a
number,
but
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
just
to
two
provisions.
section
3
(c)
states
the
illinois
use
tax
has
provided
the
exemption
from
the
tax
“to
prevent
actual
or
likely
multi-state
taxation.”
the
tax
here
imposed
shall
not
apply
for
the
use
of
tangible
personal
property
in
this
state
under
the
following
circumstances.
circumstances
(c)
is
the
use
in
the
state
of
tangible
personal
property
which
is
acquired
outside
of
the
state
and
cause
to
be
brought
into
the
state
by
a
person
who
has
already
paid
a
tax
in
another
state
in
respect
to
the
sale,
purchase
or
use
of
such
property
to
the
extent
of
the
amount
of
such
tax
so
paid
in
the
other
state.
now
the
exemption
d
which
counsel
alluded
to
the
temporary
storage
one.
temporary
storage
in
the
state
of
tangible
personal
property
which
is
acquired
outside
of
the
state
in
which
subsequent
to
being
brought
into
the
state
and
stored
here
temporarily
is
used
solely
outside
the
state
or
physically
attached
to
or
incorporated
with
a
tangible
personal
property
that
is
used
solely
outside
of
the
state.
now,
on
june
3rd,
1963,
the
department
of
revenue
of
the
state
of
illinois
issued
a
bulletin
which
provided
the
impertinent
part.
i
quote
again,
“temporary
storage
ends
and
a
taxable
use
occurs
when
the
fuel
is
taken
out
of
storage
and
placed
into
tanks
of
airplanes,
railroad
engines
or
trucks.
at
this
point,
the
fuel
is
converted
into
its
ultimate
use
and
therefore
a
taxable
use
occurs
in
the
illinois.
if
a
common
carrier
does
not
have
separate
facilities
for
the
transferring
of
the
fuel
out
of
the
state
of
illinois,
but
always
puts
it
into
the
tank
of
the
airplane,
railroad
engine
or
truck
for
final
consumption,
then
they
no
longer
will
be
able
to
give
a
certificate
to
the
vendor
stating
that
the
fuel
is
purchased
within
the
temporary
storage
provisions
of
the
use
tax
act,
but
must
pay
the
use
tax
to
their
supplier.”
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
none
of
the
gas
that
is
brought
into
the
state
of
illinois
in
this
respect
is
ever
taxed.
the
placing,
however,
of
the
fuel
into
the
instrumentality
of
consumption,
the
airplane,
then
would
cause
the
tax
on
the
fuel
placed
into
the
tank.
the
very
fact
that
it
would
be
connected
through
the
lines
and
would
be
capable
of
being
consumed
within
that
vehicle
would
subject
it
to
the
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
or
anyone
else
in
the
state
particularly
would
be
subjected
to
the
provisions
--
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
no
sir,
it
would
not.
if
it
were
loaded
onto
a
storage
tank
for
the
purpose
of
taking
it
out
of
the
state
to
be
sold
it
out
of
the
state
and
that
qualifies
it
as
a
storage
tank,
as
a
tank
truck
or
a
tank
car
on
the
railroad
or
tank
car
in
the
airplane
and
not
in
the
--.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
take
off,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
i
recall
it.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
if
it
was
still
connected
to
the
instrumentality
for
consumption,
it
would
be
an
evasion
of
the
retailer’s
occupational
tax
of
the
state
of
illinois,
would
not
qualify
for
the
exemption.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
no
sir,
we
do
not.
in
fact
that
they
exercise
dominants
or
ownership
over
that
particular
fuel
in
the
state
of
illinois
subjection
to
that
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
that
is
one
of
the
events
that
we
claim,
shows
ownership
of
that
particular
fuel.
from
the
date
of
june
3rd,
1963,
the
date
of
the
bulletin,
all
fuel
are
loaded
aboard
united's
planes
at
the
two
airports
was
deemed
to
measure
the
tax
and
the
exemption
contained
in
the
temporary
storage
provision
in
question
was
construed
as
having
application
only
if
the
temporary
storage
fuel
is
transferred
out
of
the
state
for
use
elsewhere
by
means
other
than
placing
it
in
the
equipment
which
would
consume
it.
the
first
in
priority
that
we
should
make
it
becomes
whether
upon
the
facts
stated,
there
is
an
event
upon
which
illinois
may
impose
the
use
tax
without
violating
the
commerce
clause,
and
we
submit
that
the
first
of
these
events,
is
the
storage
and
withdrawal
from
storage
at
des
plaines,
illinois
tank.
we
quote
in
our
briefs
and
also
counsel
for
the
opposition,
the
nashville,
chattanooga
tennessee
railroad
case
versus
wallace
which
is
cited
in
288
u.s.
249.
in
this
case,
tennessee
levied
a
privilege
tax
upon
the
storage
of
gasoline
within
the
state
and
its
withdrawal
from
storage
for
use
or
sale.
the
tax
payer
was
an
interstate
rail
carrier
purchasing
large
quantities
of
gasoline
outside
of
tennessee,
and
transporting
it
into
the
state
in
tank
cars
from
which
it
unloaded
it
and
placed
this
gasoline
in
storage
tanks.
all
of
the
fuel
that
was
withdrawn
and
used
by
it
as
a
source
of
motor
power
in
interstate
railway
operations
was
taxed.
the
taxpayer
challenged
the
imposition
of
the
tax
on
the
basis
that
was
imposed
on
the
gasoline
which
was
still
a
subject
of
interstate
commerce
and
also
on
the
basis
that
in
effect
that
the
tax
was
upon
the
use
of
gasoline
in
appellant’s
interstate
business.
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
held
that
the
power
to
tax
property,
the
sum
of
all
the
rights
and
powers,
incident
ownership
means
that
the
state
can
tax
the
successive
exercise
of
two
of
the
powers
incident
to
ownership,
storage
and
withdrawal
of
the
storage,
both
completed
before
interstate
commerce
began.
now
in
the
case
of
edelman
versus
boeing
air
transport
which
was
discussed,
wyoming
imposed
a
license
tax
upon
the
use
of
gasoline
within
the
state.
the
taxpayer
maintain
an
air
service
for
transportation
of
passengers,
mail,
and
express
in
interstate
commerce.
it
purchased
gasoline
from
both
within
and
without
the
state
which
it
intermingled
and
stored
in
tanks
at
two
airports.
the
taxpayer
contended
that
the
state
could
not
validly
apply
the
use
tax
to
gasoline
imported
from
outside
the
state,
stored
in
tanks
at
the
airport
and
use
for
filling
the
interstate
planes
in
which
it
was
eventually
consumed.
the
tax
was
applied
to
stored
gasoline
as
it
was
withdrawn
from
storage
tanks
at
the
airport
and
placed
in
planes.
in
this
particular
case,
the
edelman
case,
the
court
upheld
the
tax
upon
the
theory
that
a
state
may
validly
tax
the
use
to
which
gasoline
is
put
and
then
withdrawing
it
from
storage
within
the
state
and
placing
it
in
tanks
or
planes
notwithstanding
that
the
ultimate
function
was
to
generate
motive
power
for
carrying
on
interstate
commerce.
now,
united
stores
and
withdraws
at
least
twice.
once
at
des
plaines,
illinois
where
it
allows
the
fuel
to
become
commingled
with
that
of
other
airlines,
and
then
at
o’hare
where
united
again
withdraws
the
fuel
from
storage
preparatory
to
loading
it
aboard
its
aircraft
and
thus
committed
taxable
events
or
uses
not
violative
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
a
withdrawal
from
storage.
mr.
justice
blackmun
had
pointed
out,
they
also
had
a
temporary
storage
provision
there.
it
was
the
withdrawal
from
storage
that
was
the
incident
of
ownership.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
i
would
say
so,
both
edelman
and
the
nashville,
chattanooga
&
st.
louis
railroad.
it
appears
equally
certain
that
united's
acts
constitute
events
within
the
meaning
of
the
illinois
use
tax
as
well.
if
we
recall
the
language
of
the
acts,
and
i
quote
“use
means
the
exercise
by
any
person
of
any
right
or
power
over
tangible
personal
property,
incident
of
the
ownership
of
that
property.
now
any
right
or
power
includes
united’s
loading,
the
fuel
aboard
its
planes
and
the
storing
and
withdrawal
from
the
storage
of
the
fuel.
when
the
fuel
is
loaded
on
the
aircraft,
it
is
irrevocably
committed
to
its
ultimate
use.
now,
both
in
the
nashville
case
and
the
edelman
case,
the
courts
have
held
that
storage
and
withdrawal
from
storage
of
gasoline
was
complete
before
interstate
commerce
began.
it
was
further
held
that
the
burden
of
tax
was
too
indirect
and
remote
from
the
function
of
the
interstate
commerce
to
transgress
constitutional
limitations.”
now
both
the
per
curiam
and
the
dissenting
opinions
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
agree
that
the
events
of
storing
fuel
in
illinois
or
the
taking
of
fuel
from
storage
in
illinois
are
constitutionally
taxable
under
the
illinois
use
tax
because
these
events
are
complete
before
interstate
commerce
begins.
indeed,
the
united
this
morning
or
this
afternoon
conceded
that
if
temporary
storage
provisions
of
the
illinois
use
tax
did
not
apply
to
the
incidents
in
question,
then
it
is
subject
to
the
illinois
use
tax.
united
however,
asserts
that
all
fuel
placed
in
tanks
of
its
planes
continues
to
be
exempt
under
the
temporary
storage
provision
of
the
illinois
use
tax
act,
and
that
the
exemption
is
lost
and
the
fuel
is
subject
to
the
tax
only
to
the
extent
of
the
fuel
released
from
the
tanks
consumption
over
illinois.
now
the
statute
in
question
refers
to
“temporary
storage
in
this
state”
of
tangible
personal
property
and
to
such
property
“stored
here
temporarily.”
the
meaning
of
the
term
stored
or
storage
has
been
defined
as
a
deposit
in
a
store
or
a
warehouse
for
safekeeping.
here,
the
fuel
is
not
placed
in
the
tanks
of
the
airplane
for
safekeeping,
but
for
consumption
and
it
cannot
be
said,
the
fuel
will
be
solely
used
outside
of
the
state
of
the
illinois.
to
accept
the
united’s
argument
that
the
placing
of
fuel
in
departing
planes
is
going
to
continuation
of
temporary
storage
and
that
the
burning
of
fuel
in
and
over
illinois
is
the
termination
of
the
temporary
storage
and
the
fuels
released
as
the
plane
operates
is
a
local
event
or
used
this
properly
taxable
would
completely
run
us
afoul
of
helson
versus
kentucky,
and
if
united's
theory
is
correct,
then
each
state
could
pay
the
“burn
off’
as
the
plane
or
charged
the
'burn
off”
rather
as
the
plane
crossed
over
state
borders
and
this
would
then
be
chargeable
burden
to
interstate
state
commerce.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
that
is
how
far
the
theory
i
believe
could
be
carried
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
no,
it
has
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
helson
versus
kentucky
which
i
just
cited
and
we
have
cited
in
our
case
was
a
case
where
a
ferry
boat
was
operated
between
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
kentucky,
went
up
the
ohio
river,
the
gas
was
brought
aboard
the
ferry
boat
in
illinois
and
as
it
traversed
up
the
ohio
river,
75%
of
the
fuel
was
burned
off
in
the
kentucky
border
side
of
the
ohio
river.
kentucky
attempted
to
tax
the
consumption
of
that
gas
and
the
court
found
that
the
gasoline
in
this
instance
was
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
tax
was
actually
a
price
on
the
privilege
of
using
interstate
commerce
and
therefore
according
to
the
helson,
the
“burn
off”
theory
as
you
cross
the
border
could
not
be
carried
forth.
it's
our
contention
further
that
the
"burn
off"
theory
would
equally
be
imposition
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
that's
before
interstate
commerce
has
begun.
we
also
say
that
the
taxing
event
could
occur
when
they
commingle
their
fuel
both
at
des
plaines
and
storage
of
tanks
and
also
at
o’hare
airport
where
they
place
it
in
storage.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
these
are
exercises
of
ownership
according
to
the
use,
a
definition
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
but,
according
to
the
edston
case,
the
loading
of
the
airplane
or
the
withdrawal
of
it
from
the
tanks
and
the
loading
of
the
airplane
was
done
before
interstate
commerce
began.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
we
could
do
that
very
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
we
do
not
do
that
because
of
the
temporary
storage
provisions,
of
the
possibility
that
this
gas
maybe
taken
out
of
the
state
and
into
another
state
and
therefore,
impose
a
multi
tax
burden
upon
the
user
of
gas.
once
it
has
been
committed
to
its
final
use
or
the
exercise
of
ownership,
then
we
maintain
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
no,
it
could
possibly
be
taken
in
the
–
i
know
of
no
evidence
that
was
presented
but
the
argument
was
used
both
in
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
that
the
gas
could
be
taken
out
of
the
storage
tanks
in
o’hare
and
transported
to
wisconsin
for
example,
therefore,
there
would
not
be
a
tax
imposed
upon
it.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
we
want
to
consider
that
a
temporary
storage.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
yes
sir.
again
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
so
held
in
turner
versus
wright
which
is
an
illinois
case,
11
illinois,
2nd,
161
that
the
illinois
use
tax
is
a
tax
imposed
on
the
privilege
of
use,
not
on
the
extent
of
the
use
of
that
privilege.
the
definition
of
use
extends
beyond
the
actual
consumption
of
tangible
personal
property
and
once
you
get
into
the
question
of
consumption
in
the
use
tax,
it
is
then
that
you
arrive
at
the
ridiculous
situations
in
the
undue
burdens.
we
feel
that
many
parts
of
the
transaction
between
shell
and
united
are
of
sufficient
local
major
that
we
would
invite
the
imposition
of
a
retail
occupation
tax
on
the
transaction.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
well,
our
statute
does
point
out
that
any
exercise
of
ownership
would
permit
us
to
impose
the
tax
upon
that
property,
provided
it
does
not
qualify
for
an
exemption,
provided
that
there
has
not
been
tax
paid
on
the
property
to
avoid
the
multiple
tax
situation.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
i
believe
that
there
could
be
situations
where
it
could
be
unconstitutional.
now
we
recognize
the
right
of
shell
and
united
to
enter
in
any
contractual
arrangement
that
they
may
want
to.
but
such
contractual
arrangements
cannot
serve
to
defeat
the
right
of
the
state
to
tax
parties
or
events
taking
place
within
the
state.
otherwise,
an
unfair
advantage
would
inure
to
those
having
out
of
state
storage
tanks
in
that
it
would
relieve
the
parties
of
the
obligation
of
the
retail
occupation
tax
and
the
use
taxes
by
the
terms
of
their
contract.
this
would
be
discriminatory
to
those
who
do
business
in
the
illinois
and
would
destroy
the
accepted
purpose
of
the
use
tax
act
which
was
designed
in
part
to
negate
an
unfair
advantage
over
local
business
who
are
obligated
to
pay
the
retail
occupation
tax
on
fuel.
and
we
have
examples
of
this
occurring
at
o’hare
airport
where
other
airlines
come
in
to
the
airport
and
they
buy
or
purchase
the
gasoline
directly
at
the
airport
and
they
are
charged
or
responsible
for
paying
a
retail
occupation
tax.
now
the
illinois
use
tax
was
designed
to
compliment
the
retail
occupation
tax
act
and
in
the
decision
of
turner
versus
wright,
it
was
held
not
to
be
discriminatory
in
that
the
use
tax
is
imposed
at
the
same
rate
as
the
tax
under
the
retail
occupation
tax
act.
it
does
not
apply
to
out-of-state
transactions
that
would
not
measure
a
tax
under
the
retail
occupation
tax
if
that
had
occurred
in
illinois.
nor
is
it
applicable
to
the
use
of
property
purchased
outside
of
illinois
on
which
a
sale
or
use
tax
has
been
paid
in
another
state
to
the
the
extent
of
the
tax
so
paid.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
we
would
directly
tax
under
the
retail
occupation
tax
act.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
in
other
states.
we
don't
like
to
refer
it
to
as
a
sales
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
4%
and
if
it
occurs
in
municipality
and
for
example
other
airlines
coming
into
chicago
actually
pay
a
5%
tax
because
they
are
responsible
for
the
municipal
retailer’s
occupational
tax
as
well.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
mr.
berens,
yes
sir,
mr.
berens
pointed
out
that
the
use
tax
act
came
into
effect
in
1955.
two
years
after,
this
type
of
operation
had
started
with
shell
oil.
i
would
like
to
respectfully
point
out
though
that
the
retail
occupation
tax
act
was
passed
in
the
state
of
illinois
in
1933,
many,
many
more
years
prior
to
the
contractual
arrangements
between
shell.
we
maintain
if
the
court
please
that
in
position
of
the
illinois
use
tax
on
united’s
exercise
of
its
right
or
power
over
tangible
personal
property
and
this
is
the
fuel,
incident
to
its
ownership
of
that
property
in
illinois,
does
not
discriminate
it
against
interstate
commerce
since
it
neither
imposes
the
tax
solely
on
interstate
commerce
nor
imposes
a
higher
rate
of
tax
upon
interstate
commerce
nor
subjects
interstate
commerce
to
the
multiple
tax
burden.
and
it
is
upon
this
argument,
the
arguments
which
we
have
submitted
in
our
brief
that
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
before
this
court
is
whether
united
airlines
exercise
such
a
right
or
power
over
tangible
property,
in
this
case,
it
is
aviation
fuel.
incident
of
the
ownership
of
that
property
in
illinois,
so
as
to
subject
united
to
the
provisions
of
the
illinois
use
tax.
whether
or
not
the
imposition
of
this
tax
is
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
set
forth
in
article
i,
section
8,
clause
3
of
the
constitution,
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
illinois
use
tax
which
went
into
effect
in
august
of
1955,
imposes
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
using
in
the
state
of
illinois
tangible
personal
property
that
was
purchased
elsewhere
and
was
designed
to
compliment
the
retailer's
occupational
tax
under
which
a
tax
is
imposed
upon
person’s
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
tangible
personal
property
to
purchasers
for
use
and
consumption.
now
both
of
these
statues,
the
illinois
use
tax
and
the
illinois
retailer's
occupation
tax
have
both
been
found
to
be
constitutional.
the
use
tax
act
of
illinois
was
enacted
for
the
valid
purposes
of
preventing
evasion
of
the
retailer's
occupational
tax
by
persons
making
out
of
state
purchases
of
tangible
personal
property
for
use
in
the
illinois,
and
also
the
additional
purpose
of
protecting
illinois
merchants
against
diversion
of
businesses.
shell
oil
company
in
this
case
refines
its
turbine
fuel
and
its
refineries
in
wood
river,
illinois,
then
transfers
it
via
pipelines
250
miles
to
storage
facilities
in
hammond
and
east
chicago,
indiana
for
storage.
both
hammond
and
east
chicago,
indiana
are
south
suburbs
of
the
city
of
chicago
and
no
further
processing
occurs
at
shell’s
facilities,
merely
the
filtering
necessitated
by
the
pipeline
transfer.
united
air
lines
purchase
this
aviation
from
fuel.
united
sends
its
orders
into
shell's
office
in
east
chicago,
indiana,
takes
delivery
in
indiana,
and
transfers
the
aviation
fuel
via
a
common
carrier
pipeline,
to
the
storage
tanks
in
des
plaines,
illinois
which
is
a
northwest
suburb
of
the
city
of
chicago
just
adjacent
to
o’hare
airport.
the
storage
tanks
in
des
plaines
are
owned
by
shell
oil
company,
but
are
leased
to
united
and
to
american,
where
gas
owned
by
both
companies
is
commingled.
the
aviation
fuel
is
allowed
to
settle
in
storage
tanks
in
des
plaines,
illinois
before
it
is
transferred
again
by
pipeline
owned
by
shell
but
leased
to
united,
united’s
o’hare
airport
underground
facilities.
these
underground
tank
service
the
jet
aircraft,
before
they
embark
from
o’hare.
the
delivery
of
the
gasoline
to
chicago’s
midway
airport
is
via
common
carrier
tanks,
trucks
from
shell’s
indiana
facilities
to
the
midway
airport.
now,
all
aviation
fuel
that
is
ultimately
pumped
into
united's
aircraft
at
either
o’hare
or
at
midway
and
that
is
subject
to
the
present
litigation
is
either
refined
and/or
stored
by
shell
at
wood
river,
illinois
facilities
prior
to
its
transfer
to
hammond
and
east
chicago.
now
shell
claims
that
it
pays
an
income
tax
based
on
one
half
of
one
percent
of
its
gross
sales
in
indiana,
but
shell
pays
no
sales
tax
or
retail
occupation
tax
to
the
state
of
indiana,
or
to
the
state
of
illinois.
united
does
not
pay
any
sales
tax
or
use
tax
in
any
state
other
than
the
illinois
on
the
purchase
of
the
fuel
involved
in
this
controversy.
from
august,
1955
until
june
3rd,
1963,
united
paid
to
the
state
of
illinois
without
protest
a
use
tax
on
this
fuel
purchase,
delivery
and
storage
on
that
portion
of
the
fuel
deemed
to
have
been
used
or
consumed
within
the
borders
of
illinois
on
flights
departing
from
midway
and
o’hare
to
points
outside
of
illinois.
the
advantage
of
this
“burn
off”
theory
is
that
in
many
instances
it
would
make
united
subject
only
to
a
use
tax
on
the
10-15
mile
trip
from
o’hare
to
lake
michigan.
then
as
now,
illinois's
use
tax
was
imposed
upon
the
privilege
of
using
in
illinois,
tangible
personal
property
which
is
purchased
at
retail.
now
use
as
is
defined
in
the
illinois
statute,
is
defined
“exercise
by
any
person
of
any
right
or
power
over
tangible
personal
property
incident
to
the
ownership
of
that
property.”
now,
section
3
of
the
illinois
use
tax
from
its
inception
in
1955
has
provided
for
exemptions
from
the
payment
of
that
tax
and
we
recite
these
in
our
brief.
there
are
quite
a
number,
but
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
just
to
two
provisions.
section
3
(c)
states
the
illinois
use
tax
has
provided
the
exemption
from
the
tax
“to
prevent
actual
or
likely
multi-state
taxation.”
the
tax
here
imposed
shall
not
apply
for
the
use
of
tangible
personal
property
in
this
state
under
the
following
circumstances.
circumstances
(c)
is
the
use
in
the
state
of
tangible
personal
property
which
is
acquired
outside
of
the
state
and
cause
to
be
brought
into
the
state
by
a
person
who
has
already
paid
a
tax
in
another
state
in
respect
to
the
sale,
purchase
or
use
of
such
property
to
the
extent
of
the
amount
of
such
tax
so
paid
in
the
other
state.
now
the
exemption
d
which
counsel
alluded
to
the
temporary
storage
one.
temporary
storage
in
the
state
of
tangible
personal
property
which
is
acquired
outside
of
the
state
in
which
subsequent
to
being
brought
into
the
state
and
stored
here
temporarily
is
used
solely
outside
the
state
or
physically
attached
to
or
incorporated
with
a
tangible
personal
property
that
is
used
solely
outside
of
the
state.
now,
on
june
3rd,
1963,
the
department
of
revenue
of
the
state
of
illinois
issued
a
bulletin
which
provided
the
impertinent
part.
i
quote
again,
“temporary
storage
ends
and
a
taxable
use
occurs
when
the
fuel
is
taken
out
of
storage
and
placed
into
tanks
of
airplanes,
railroad
engines
or
trucks.
at
this
point,
the
fuel
is
converted
into
its
ultimate
use
and
therefore
a
taxable
use
occurs
in
the
illinois.
if
a
common
carrier
does
not
have
separate
facilities
for
the
transferring
of
the
fuel
out
of
the
state
of
illinois,
but
always
puts
it
into
the
tank
of
the
airplane,
railroad
engine
or
truck
for
final
consumption,
then
they
no
longer
will
be
able
to
give
a
certificate
to
the
vendor
stating
that
the
fuel
is
purchased
within
the
temporary
storage
provisions
of
the
use
tax
act,
but
must
pay
the
use
tax
to
their
supplier.”
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
none
of
the
gas
that
is
brought
into
the
state
of
illinois
in
this
respect
is
ever
taxed.
the
placing,
however,
of
the
fuel
into
the
instrumentality
of
consumption,
the
airplane,
then
would
cause
the
tax
on
the
fuel
placed
into
the
tank.
the
very
fact
that
it
would
be
connected
through
the
lines
and
would
be
capable
of
being
consumed
within
that
vehicle
would
subject
it
to
the
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
or
anyone
else
in
the
state
particularly
would
be
subjected
to
the
provisions
--
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
no
sir,
it
would
not.
if
it
were
loaded
onto
a
storage
tank
for
the
purpose
of
taking
it
out
of
the
state
to
be
sold
it
out
of
the
state
and
that
qualifies
it
as
a
storage
tank,
as
a
tank
truck
or
a
tank
car
on
the
railroad
or
tank
car
in
the
airplane
and
not
in
the
--.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
take
off,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
i
recall
it.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
if
it
was
still
connected
to
the
instrumentality
for
consumption,
it
would
be
an
evasion
of
the
retailer’s
occupational
tax
of
the
state
of
illinois,
would
not
qualify
for
the
exemption.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
no
sir,
we
do
not.
in
fact
that
they
exercise
dominants
or
ownership
over
that
particular
fuel
in
the
state
of
illinois
subjection
to
that
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
that
is
one
of
the
events
that
we
claim,
shows
ownership
of
that
particular
fuel.
from
the
date
of
june
3rd,
1963,
the
date
of
the
bulletin,
all
fuel
are
loaded
aboard
united's
planes
at
the
two
airports
was
deemed
to
measure
the
tax
and
the
exemption
contained
in
the
temporary
storage
provision
in
question
was
construed
as
having
application
only
if
the
temporary
storage
fuel
is
transferred
out
of
the
state
for
use
elsewhere
by
means
other
than
placing
it
in
the
equipment
which
would
consume
it.
the
first
in
priority
that
we
should
make
it
becomes
whether
upon
the
facts
stated,
there
is
an
event
upon
which
illinois
may
impose
the
use
tax
without
violating
the
commerce
clause,
and
we
submit
that
the
first
of
these
events,
is
the
storage
and
withdrawal
from
storage
at
des
plaines,
illinois
tank.
we
quote
in
our
briefs
and
also
counsel
for
the
opposition,
the
nashville,
chattanooga
tennessee
railroad
case
versus
wallace
which
is
cited
in
288
u.s.
249.
in
this
case,
tennessee
levied
a
privilege
tax
upon
the
storage
of
gasoline
within
the
state
and
its
withdrawal
from
storage
for
use
or
sale.
the
tax
payer
was
an
interstate
rail
carrier
purchasing
large
quantities
of
gasoline
outside
of
tennessee,
and
transporting
it
into
the
state
in
tank
cars
from
which
it
unloaded
it
and
placed
this
gasoline
in
storage
tanks.
all
of
the
fuel
that
was
withdrawn
and
used
by
it
as
a
source
of
motor
power
in
interstate
railway
operations
was
taxed.
the
taxpayer
challenged
the
imposition
of
the
tax
on
the
basis
that
was
imposed
on
the
gasoline
which
was
still
a
subject
of
interstate
commerce
and
also
on
the
basis
that
in
effect
that
the
tax
was
upon
the
use
of
gasoline
in
appellant’s
interstate
business.
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
held
that
the
power
to
tax
property,
the
sum
of
all
the
rights
and
powers,
incident
ownership
means
that
the
state
can
tax
the
successive
exercise
of
two
of
the
powers
incident
to
ownership,
storage
and
withdrawal
of
the
storage,
both
completed
before
interstate
commerce
began.
now
in
the
case
of
edelman
versus
boeing
air
transport
which
was
discussed,
wyoming
imposed
a
license
tax
upon
the
use
of
gasoline
within
the
state.
the
taxpayer
maintain
an
air
service
for
transportation
of
passengers,
mail,
and
express
in
interstate
commerce.
it
purchased
gasoline
from
both
within
and
without
the
state
which
it
intermingled
and
stored
in
tanks
at
two
airports.
the
taxpayer
contended
that
the
state
could
not
validly
apply
the
use
tax
to
gasoline
imported
from
outside
the
state,
stored
in
tanks
at
the
airport
and
use
for
filling
the
interstate
planes
in
which
it
was
eventually
consumed.
the
tax
was
applied
to
stored
gasoline
as
it
was
withdrawn
from
storage
tanks
at
the
airport
and
placed
in
planes.
in
this
particular
case,
the
edelman
case,
the
court
upheld
the
tax
upon
the
theory
that
a
state
may
validly
tax
the
use
to
which
gasoline
is
put
and
then
withdrawing
it
from
storage
within
the
state
and
placing
it
in
tanks
or
planes
notwithstanding
that
the
ultimate
function
was
to
generate
motive
power
for
carrying
on
interstate
commerce.
now,
united
stores
and
withdraws
at
least
twice.
once
at
des
plaines,
illinois
where
it
allows
the
fuel
to
become
commingled
with
that
of
other
airlines,
and
then
at
o’hare
where
united
again
withdraws
the
fuel
from
storage
preparatory
to
loading
it
aboard
its
aircraft
and
thus
committed
taxable
events
or
uses
not
violative
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
a
withdrawal
from
storage.
mr.
justice
blackmun
had
pointed
out,
they
also
had
a
temporary
storage
provision
there.
it
was
the
withdrawal
from
storage
that
was
the
incident
of
ownership.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
i
would
say
so,
both
edelman
and
the
nashville,
chattanooga
&
st.
louis
railroad.
it
appears
equally
certain
that
united's
acts
constitute
events
within
the
meaning
of
the
illinois
use
tax
as
well.
if
we
recall
the
language
of
the
acts,
and
i
quote
“use
means
the
exercise
by
any
person
of
any
right
or
power
over
tangible
personal
property,
incident
of
the
ownership
of
that
property.
now
any
right
or
power
includes
united’s
loading,
the
fuel
aboard
its
planes
and
the
storing
and
withdrawal
from
the
storage
of
the
fuel.
when
the
fuel
is
loaded
on
the
aircraft,
it
is
irrevocably
committed
to
its
ultimate
use.
now,
both
in
the
nashville
case
and
the
edelman
case,
the
courts
have
held
that
storage
and
withdrawal
from
storage
of
gasoline
was
complete
before
interstate
commerce
began.
it
was
further
held
that
the
burden
of
tax
was
too
indirect
and
remote
from
the
function
of
the
interstate
commerce
to
transgress
constitutional
limitations.”
now
both
the
per
curiam
and
the
dissenting
opinions
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
agree
that
the
events
of
storing
fuel
in
illinois
or
the
taking
of
fuel
from
storage
in
illinois
are
constitutionally
taxable
under
the
illinois
use
tax
because
these
events
are
complete
before
interstate
commerce
begins.
indeed,
the
united
this
morning
or
this
afternoon
conceded
that
if
temporary
storage
provisions
of
the
illinois
use
tax
did
not
apply
to
the
incidents
in
question,
then
it
is
subject
to
the
illinois
use
tax.
united
however,
asserts
that
all
fuel
placed
in
tanks
of
its
planes
continues
to
be
exempt
under
the
temporary
storage
provision
of
the
illinois
use
tax
act,
and
that
the
exemption
is
lost
and
the
fuel
is
subject
to
the
tax
only
to
the
extent
of
the
fuel
released
from
the
tanks
consumption
over
illinois.
now
the
statute
in
question
refers
to
“temporary
storage
in
this
state”
of
tangible
personal
property
and
to
such
property
“stored
here
temporarily.”
the
meaning
of
the
term
stored
or
storage
has
been
defined
as
a
deposit
in
a
store
or
a
warehouse
for
safekeeping.
here,
the
fuel
is
not
placed
in
the
tanks
of
the
airplane
for
safekeeping,
but
for
consumption
and
it
cannot
be
said,
the
fuel
will
be
solely
used
outside
of
the
state
of
the
illinois.
to
accept
the
united’s
argument
that
the
placing
of
fuel
in
departing
planes
is
going
to
continuation
of
temporary
storage
and
that
the
burning
of
fuel
in
and
over
illinois
is
the
termination
of
the
temporary
storage
and
the
fuels
released
as
the
plane
operates
is
a
local
event
or
used
this
properly
taxable
would
completely
run
us
afoul
of
helson
versus
kentucky,
and
if
united's
theory
is
correct,
then
each
state
could
pay
the
“burn
off’
as
the
plane
or
charged
the
'burn
off”
rather
as
the
plane
crossed
over
state
borders
and
this
would
then
be
chargeable
burden
to
interstate
state
commerce.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
that
is
how
far
the
theory
i
believe
could
be
carried
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
no,
it
has
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
helson
versus
kentucky
which
i
just
cited
and
we
have
cited
in
our
case
was
a
case
where
a
ferry
boat
was
operated
between
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
kentucky,
went
up
the
ohio
river,
the
gas
was
brought
aboard
the
ferry
boat
in
illinois
and
as
it
traversed
up
the
ohio
river,
75%
of
the
fuel
was
burned
off
in
the
kentucky
border
side
of
the
ohio
river.
kentucky
attempted
to
tax
the
consumption
of
that
gas
and
the
court
found
that
the
gasoline
in
this
instance
was
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
tax
was
actually
a
price
on
the
privilege
of
using
interstate
commerce
and
therefore
according
to
the
helson,
the
“burn
off”
theory
as
you
cross
the
border
could
not
be
carried
forth.
it's
our
contention
further
that
the
"burn
off"
theory
would
equally
be
imposition
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
that's
before
interstate
commerce
has
begun.
we
also
say
that
the
taxing
event
could
occur
when
they
commingle
their
fuel
both
at
des
plaines
and
storage
of
tanks
and
also
at
o’hare
airport
where
they
place
it
in
storage.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
these
are
exercises
of
ownership
according
to
the
use,
a
definition
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
but,
according
to
the
edston
case,
the
loading
of
the
airplane
or
the
withdrawal
of
it
from
the
tanks
and
the
loading
of
the
airplane
was
done
before
interstate
commerce
began.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
we
could
do
that
very
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
we
do
not
do
that
because
of
the
temporary
storage
provisions,
of
the
possibility
that
this
gas
maybe
taken
out
of
the
state
and
into
another
state
and
therefore,
impose
a
multi
tax
burden
upon
the
user
of
gas.
once
it
has
been
committed
to
its
final
use
or
the
exercise
of
ownership,
then
we
maintain
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
no,
it
could
possibly
be
taken
in
the
–
i
know
of
no
evidence
that
was
presented
but
the
argument
was
used
both
in
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
that
the
gas
could
be
taken
out
of
the
storage
tanks
in
o’hare
and
transported
to
wisconsin
for
example,
therefore,
there
would
not
be
a
tax
imposed
upon
it.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
we
want
to
consider
that
a
temporary
storage.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
yes
sir.
again
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
so
held
in
turner
versus
wright
which
is
an
illinois
case,
11
illinois,
2nd,
161
that
the
illinois
use
tax
is
a
tax
imposed
on
the
privilege
of
use,
not
on
the
extent
of
the
use
of
that
privilege.
the
definition
of
use
extends
beyond
the
actual
consumption
of
tangible
personal
property
and
once
you
get
into
the
question
of
consumption
in
the
use
tax,
it
is
then
that
you
arrive
at
the
ridiculous
situations
in
the
undue
burdens.
we
feel
that
many
parts
of
the
transaction
between
shell
and
united
are
of
sufficient
local
major
that
we
would
invite
the
imposition
of
a
retail
occupation
tax
on
the
transaction.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
well,
our
statute
does
point
out
that
any
exercise
of
ownership
would
permit
us
to
impose
the
tax
upon
that
property,
provided
it
does
not
qualify
for
an
exemption,
provided
that
there
has
not
been
tax
paid
on
the
property
to
avoid
the
multiple
tax
situation.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
i
believe
that
there
could
be
situations
where
it
could
be
unconstitutional.
now
we
recognize
the
right
of
shell
and
united
to
enter
in
any
contractual
arrangement
that
they
may
want
to.
but
such
contractual
arrangements
cannot
serve
to
defeat
the
right
of
the
state
to
tax
parties
or
events
taking
place
within
the
state.
otherwise,
an
unfair
advantage
would
inure
to
those
having
out
of
state
storage
tanks
in
that
it
would
relieve
the
parties
of
the
obligation
of
the
retail
occupation
tax
and
the
use
taxes
by
the
terms
of
their
contract.
this
would
be
discriminatory
to
those
who
do
business
in
the
illinois
and
would
destroy
the
accepted
purpose
of
the
use
tax
act
which
was
designed
in
part
to
negate
an
unfair
advantage
over
local
business
who
are
obligated
to
pay
the
retail
occupation
tax
on
fuel.
and
we
have
examples
of
this
occurring
at
o’hare
airport
where
other
airlines
come
in
to
the
airport
and
they
buy
or
purchase
the
gasoline
directly
at
the
airport
and
they
are
charged
or
responsible
for
paying
a
retail
occupation
tax.
now
the
illinois
use
tax
was
designed
to
compliment
the
retail
occupation
tax
act
and
in
the
decision
of
turner
versus
wright,
it
was
held
not
to
be
discriminatory
in
that
the
use
tax
is
imposed
at
the
same
rate
as
the
tax
under
the
retail
occupation
tax
act.
it
does
not
apply
to
out-of-state
transactions
that
would
not
measure
a
tax
under
the
retail
occupation
tax
if
that
had
occurred
in
illinois.
nor
is
it
applicable
to
the
use
of
property
purchased
outside
of
illinois
on
which
a
sale
or
use
tax
has
been
paid
in
another
state
to
the
the
extent
of
the
tax
so
paid.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
we
would
directly
tax
under
the
retail
occupation
tax
act.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
in
other
states.
we
don't
like
to
refer
it
to
as
a
sales
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
4%
and
if
it
occurs
in
municipality
and
for
example
other
airlines
coming
into
chicago
actually
pay
a
5%
tax
because
they
are
responsible
for
the
municipal
retailer’s
occupational
tax
as
well.
mr.
robert
j.
o'rourke
mr.
berens,
yes
sir,
mr.
berens
pointed
out
that
the
use
tax
act
came
into
effect
in
1955.
two
years
after,
this
type
of
operation
had
started
with
shell
oil.
i
would
like
to
respectfully
point
out
though
that
the
retail
occupation
tax
act
was
passed
in
the
state
of
illinois
in
1933,
many,
many
more
years
prior
to
the
contractual
arrangements
between
shell.
we
maintain
if
the
court
please
that
in
position
of
the
illinois
use
tax
on
united’s
exercise
of
its
right
or
power
over
tangible
personal
property
and
this
is
the
fuel,
incident
to
its
ownership
of
that
property
in
illinois,
does
not
discriminate
it
against
interstate
commerce
since
it
neither
imposes
the
tax
solely
on
interstate
commerce
nor
imposes
a
higher
rate
of
tax
upon
interstate
commerce
nor
subjects
interstate
commerce
to
the
multiple
tax
burden.
and
it
is
upon
this
argument,
the
arguments
which
we
have
submitted
in
our
brief
that
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
thank
you.
