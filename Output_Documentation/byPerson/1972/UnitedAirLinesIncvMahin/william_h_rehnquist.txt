justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
berens,
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
said,
instead
of,
as
you
say
at
least
by
implication
of
the
taxable
event
was
the
loading,
that
the
taxable
event
was
the
storage
in
an
immobile
storage
container
for
whatever
period
of
time,
would
your
case
be
any
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
you
want
to
get
away
from
formalism
in
insight,
a
very
authoritative
precedence
to
that
effect
and
yet
if
you
concede
that
illinois
could
have
reached
the
same
result
had
it
just
picked
the
right
incident
to
tax,
i.e.
the
storage
itself,
your
own
position
has
a
certain
formalism
to
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
really
cannot
reconcile
all
of
the
cases
from
this
court
on
the
subject,
can
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
o’rourke,
your
opposing
counsel
cites
justice
rutledge's
opinion
in
nippert
case
in
their
brief
where
as
i
understand
it
he
said
that
it
isn't
enough
to
just
say
i
am
thinking
of
the
state
as
they
picking
out
a
local
incident
that
occurs
or
it
still
could
be
a
burden
under
interstate
commerce.
you
have
got
to
go
further
than
just
say
an
event
however
small
in
the
statute
took
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional
however
applied?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
shell’s
facilities
were
in
chicago
heights
instead
of
ham,
you
wouldn't
have
this
problem
because
you
simply
directly
tax
the
sale?
