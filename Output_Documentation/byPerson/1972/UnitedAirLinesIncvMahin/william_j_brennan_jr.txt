justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
did
you
say,
it
remained
at
the
airport
before
it
was
loaded
aboard
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
to
clean
the
impurities
and
substance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning
that
there
maybe
quantity
is
more
than
aircraft
probably
need?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
quantity
loaded
on
a
particular
aircraft
differs,
does
it
depending
on
how
much
--.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
surely
the
issue
here,
doesn't
depend
on
whether
a
particular
airline
crosses
few
more
miles
of
illinois
than
united
does?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
this
would
be
a
decision
for
united
only?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
us
see,
i
think,
what
have
we
got
in
this,
80
or
more
decisions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
then
300,
you
reconcile
even
80,
i
think
you
have
done
quite
a
job.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
getting
back
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
to
you.
i
notice
you
have
bracketed
it
at
least
page
31
where
you
quote,
on
supreme
court,
you
have
bracketed
the
word
interstate.
but
isn't
there
something
like
the
evans
will
approach
to
the
supreme
court
as
illinois
taken,
drafting
out
your
interstate,
speaking
about
these
operations
to
facilitate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
my
question
was,
do
you
not
think
that
the
approach
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
taking?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
storage,
i
take
it
whether
it
is
used
an
intra
or
interstate
flights,
it
is
all
stored
in
the
same
tanks,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
for
12
days
and
i
expect
in
that
period
there
is
considerable
quantity
withdrawn
and
loaded
to
board
intrastate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
might
be
so,
but
nevertheless,
i
think
you
have
already
agreed,
have
you
not,
that
what
is
burned
between
chicago
and
moline
is
taxable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
not
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
--
of
course
evansville
was
decided
after
this
case
was
decided.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
true
in
evansville
too.
they
also
paid
the
landing
fees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
why
we
had
the
companion
new
hampshire
case,
i
have
forgotten
the
name
of
it
where
they
had
all
kinds
of
additional
fees
besides
the
departure
and
airport
tax?
justice
