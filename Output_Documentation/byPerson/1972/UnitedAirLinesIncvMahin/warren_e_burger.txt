warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
in
71-862,
united
air
lines
against
mahin.
mr.
berens,
you
can
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
within
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
depending
i
suppose
if
they
are
going
due
west
or
southwest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
take
it,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
if
they
use
all
the
gasoline
up
or
whatever
fuel
this
is
and
make
another
stop
in
illinois,
you
might
have
quite
a
different
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
only
amount
loaded
not
the
amount
consumed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
normally
they
hope
it's
quite
closed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
don't
want
to
carry
excess
fuel
but
they
certainly
want
to
carry
enough.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
just
meet
weather
problems
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
take
it
your
argue
that
this
is
necessary
incident
to
the
interstate
commerce
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
fuel
is
ever
used
for
any
other
purpose
than
for
these
planes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then.
and
i
will
ask
your
friend
to
indicate
what
is
the
distinction
in
terms
of
its
dedication
for
ultimate
use,
why
that
doesn't
occur
as
soon
as
it
gets
in
the
storage
tanks
at
the
airport
and
i
think
that's
for
him
rather
than
you.
i
can
anticipate
your
answer
to
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
title
of
that
case
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
you
suggesting
that
we
construe
the
statute
that
way
or
save
it
by
saying
it
can
exceed
the
“burn
off”
rate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
o’rourke.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
it
is
stocked
or
not,
are
you
suggesting
it
could
charge
a
“burn
off”
tax
for
just
to
fly
over
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
case
gone
that
far,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
that
putting
an
inland
tank
committing
any--
it
does
commit
it
to
the
use
in
that
airplane,
but
that
is
not
a
commitment
to
carry
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
tell
me
again
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
that
this
was
--
that
some
event
was
before
interstate
commerce
had
begun
in
the
loading
event?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
aircraft
is
--
according
to
interstate
commerce
then
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
mr.
o’rourke.

think
you
used
all
your
time,
mr.
