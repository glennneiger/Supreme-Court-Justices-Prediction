mr.
o’rourke,
suppose
the
united
plane
has
two
tanks.
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
is
the
fuel
that
is
leftover,
when
they
land
and
other
the
fuel
they
pick
up
and
when
they
land,
they
turn
on
the
tank
of
the
fuel
that
is
leftover,
and
they
turn
on
the
other
tank
when
they
cross
lake
michigan.
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
they
put
on
second
tank
a
sign
which
says,
“storage
tank”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wouldn't
be
taxed
if
it
were
put
on
the
plane
in
the
cargo
department
or
something
--?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
just
thinking
in
the
good
old
days
when
we
first
put
liquor
on
the
plane,
they
used
to
have
things
on
there
that
locked
it
up
until
after
they
got
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose,
they
put
like
that
on
this
tank,
then
what
would
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
o’rourke,
why
don't
you
tax
the
storage
tank?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
question
if
this
gas
is
always
used
in
united
plane?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it's
just
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
just
upon
as
caution,
you
knew
you
could
do
it,
but
you
want
to
be
sure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
take
it
your
reference
to
the
impropriety
of
the
"burn
off"
theory
concedes
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
tax
collected
in
earlier
years
under
the
old
system?
