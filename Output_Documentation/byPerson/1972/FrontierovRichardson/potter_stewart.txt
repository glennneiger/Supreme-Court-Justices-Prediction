the

is
there
is
a
higher

among
the

justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
have
to
be
the
reason,
wouldn’t
it?
justice

stewart
and
we’re
dealing
here
with
military
personnel
whose
spouses

civilians,
are
we
not?
justice

stewart
are

justice

does
these

justice

stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
we
talking
about
the

of
numbers?
i
suppose
what
98-99%
of
the
military

are
males
or
is
that
to
a
higher
percentage?
justice
potter
stewart
so
would
this
percentage
of
--
somewhat
comparable
to
that
i
mentioned?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
understood
that
the
good
part

it
not?

there
used

idea
that
a

or
statute
enacted

of
the

was
presumptively
constitutional.
we
don’t
hear

one,
isn’t
it?
justice

stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
construction
to
which
i
referred
was
sort
of
based
upon
the

would
consider
the
constitution
before
it
enacted
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
basis
of
that
rule
statutory
construction,
that
the

could
read
the

as
well
as
other
people.
