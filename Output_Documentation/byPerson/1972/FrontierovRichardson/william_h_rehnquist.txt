justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
levin,
you
say
that
it’s
a
personal
right
you
claim
here,
following
the
analysis
in
weber.
but
it’s
a
personal
right
to
more
money,
isn’t
it?
well,
what
more
you
are
claiming
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
can
argue
any
equal
protection
that
way.
you
are
saying
in
effect,
i
want
to
be
free
from
this
discrimination
that
i
claim
exists.
but
i
would
think
if
you
follow
the
weber
analogy,
you
got
to
see
what
it
is
your
claiming,
what
you
would
get
if
your
claim
were
sustained?
