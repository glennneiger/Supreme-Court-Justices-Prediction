justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
you
put
it,
the
discrimination
is
against
the
men,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
like
a
90%
or
what
ir
do
you
know
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
18%.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
danger
of
fraud
in
these
areas
as
part
of
the
government’s
aim
or
let’s
assume
that
you
are
trying
to
determine
if
the
parents
or
older
children
are
dependent,
do
you
just
take
an
affidavit
or
what
do
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
will
be
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
end
of
it,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
is
that
the
large
administrative
burden
you’re
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
mean,
i
agree
it’s
a
burden
but
i’m
just
trying
to
find
out
how
much
of
the
burden
it
is.
it’s
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
making
an
affidavit,
and
then
somebody
will
have
to
read
them,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn’t
it
be
the
other
--
how
about
–
how
about
letting
the
women
claim
--
you
could
treat
women
the
same
as
men
the
other
way
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
treat
them
like
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
--
if
we
agreed
with
the
other
side,
what
do
you
understand
the
consequence
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
we
strike
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
we
strike
that
provision
down
which
provides
for
their
allowance
then
how
do
they
get
the
allowance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
just
strike
down
the
discrimination,
the
other
way
of
doing
it
would
be
to
say
that
the
--
is
that
the
male
must
prove
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn’t
say
preferable,
i
wondered
how
do
you
know
which
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
we
just
strike
down
that
particular
part
of
the
statute
of
the
provision,
just
those
particular
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
fact
in
401
the
definition
says
that
a
dependent
is
a
--
of
a
member
of
the
service
is
one,
his
spouse;
two,
is
unmarried
minor
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
down
below
it
says
however,
the
first
is
not
a
dependent
of
a
female
member
unless
he
is
in
fact
dependent
on
her
for
over
half
his
support.
now,
what
do
we
strike
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
sentence.
well,
then
there
are
no
provisions
for
a
man
being
independent,
because
up
above,
it’s
just
a
female
member,
his
spouse.
justice
byron
r.
white
obviously,
i
mean
if
the
constitution
discriminated
what,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn’t,
is
it
so?
that
means
his,
it
means
his
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
we
do
have
to
change
the
meaning
of
“his”
in
one,
don’t
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
make
it
his
or
hers?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
means
not
--
now
doesn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
we
need
to
strike
that
one
sentence?
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
you
put
it,
the
