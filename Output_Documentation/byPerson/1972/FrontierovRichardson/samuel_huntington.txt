mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
first
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
different
treatment
of
male
and
female
members
of
the
armed
forces
in
the
statute
here
under
review.
and
second,
that
the
rational
basis
standard
is
the
proper
standard
for
determining
the
validity
of
those
statutes.
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
statutes
and
then
discuss
the
appropriate
standard
of
review.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
begin
by
reviewing
the
actual
impact
of
the
housing
allowance
and
medical
care
statutes
here
in
issue.
the
housing
allowance
statute
is
37
u.s.c.
403
grants
a
basic
housing
allowance
to
each
member
of
the
military
for
whom
on-base
housing
is
not
available.
in
addition,
each
such
member
is
entitled
to
an
increased
housing
allowance
if
he
has
one
or
more
dependents
as
defined
by
37
u.s.c.
401.
under
the
scale
which
is
now
in
existence,
for
example,
a
lieutenant
in
pay
grade
ii
would
be
entitled
to
$138.60
for
--
per
month
for
housing
without
dependents
and
$175.80
with
dependents,
a
difference
of
$37.20.
now,
the
particular
issue
here
of
course
concerns
under
what
circumstances
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
may
claim
a
spouse
as
a
dependent.
and
the
general
rule
under
the
statute
is
that
wives
of
male
members
qualified
automatically
for
dependency
benefits,
whereas
husbands
of
female
members
qualify
only
if
dependent
in
fact
on
their
wives
for
over
half
of
their
support.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
it
applies
to
everyone.
mr.
samuel
huntington
there
is
an
amount.
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
would
like
to
point
out,
now
first
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
right.
housing
is
available
and
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
right.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
under
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
didn’t
mean
to
imply
that.
no,
it’s
--[attempt
to
laughter]
the
--
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
under
37
u.s.c.
420
in
the
case
of
an
inter-service
marriage,
neither
the
husband
nor
the
wife
may
claim
his
or
her
spouse
as
a
dependent.
now,
this
fact
has
considerable
importance
here
for
a
significant
majority
of
married
women
in
the
armed
force
are
married
to
military
men.
now
while
the
record
is
silent
on
this
matter,
the
senate
report
issued
on
the
proposals
in
congress
last
year
to
amend
these
statutes
contained
a
letter
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
department
of
defense
which
is
in
point.
in
the
letter,
at
page
4
of
the
report
that’s
senate
report
92-1218,
it
is
noted
that
a
recently
completed
survey
of
married
women
in
the
air
force
show
that
25%
of
the
officers
were
married,
but
that
only
4%
of
the
officers
were
married
to
civilians
and
the
percentage
of
all
women
in
the
air
force
married
to
civilians
is
even
smaller.
in
not
being
able
to
claim
their
husbands
as
dependents,
military
women
married
to
military
men
are
not
discriminated
against
since
their
husbands
could
not
claim
them
either.
similarly,
a
female
member
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
that
would
be
--[laughter]
mr.
samuel
huntington
one
way,
yes.
well,
this
is
also
true
that
these
women
who
married
the
military
men
are
not
discriminated
with
respect
to
medical
benefits
because
under
10
u.s.c.
1074
both
the
husband
and
the
wife
would
qualify
for
medical
benefits.
well,
in
short
then
the
only
women
who
are
treated
differently
then
their
male
counterparts
are
those
women
who
are
married
to
civilian.
now,
in
our
view,
one
does
not
have
to
search
far
to
discover
a
rational
basis
for
congress’
decision
to
treat
married
men
and
married
women
differently
with
respect
to
dependency
benefits.
we
start
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
two
statutes.
and
the
basic
purpose
is
to
provide
housing
allowance
and
medical
benefits
for
dependents
in
order
to
establish
a
compensation
pattern
which
would
attract
career
personnel
into
the
armed
forces.
in
congress’
view,
this
would
enable
the
military
to
compete
with
the
civilian
sector
of
the
economy
for
married
people.
now
in
establishing
these
benefits,
congress
had
to
determine
what
proof
of
dependency
it
would
require.
now,
an
examination
of
this
statute
shows
that
where
it
was
very
likely
that
a
military
person
would
be
supporting
certain
relatives,
dependency
benefits
were
conferred
automatically
where
it
would
be
less
likely
or
unusual
that
a
military
member
would
be
supporting
a
person,
proof
of
dependency
was
required.
thus,
under
37
u.s.c.
401,
a
serviceman’s
wife
and
minor
children
automatically
qualify
for
dependency
benefits,
whereas,
his
older
children
and
his
parents
would
qualify
only
if
dependent
in
fact.
and
since
women,
generally
do
not
provide
the
main
support
for
their
husbands,
children,
or
parents,
servicewomen
were
required
to
establish
to
establish
dependency
in
fact
in
each
case.
let
me
state
this
in
other
way.
taking
the
over
one
million
married
military
men
as
a
group,
a
significant
majority
of
their
wives
are
the
dependent
upon
them.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
rational
to
decide
to
grant
all
married
men
dependency
benefits
for
their
wives
automatically
rather
than
undertaking
the
heavy
administrative
burden
of
determining
dependency
in
fact
in
each
case.
on
the
other
hand,
taking
the
one
or
two
thousand
military
women
who
are
married
to
civilians
as
a
group,
an
overwhelming
majority
of
their
husbands
are
not
dependent
upon
them.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
rational
to
examine
individually
the
few
instances
where
a
military
woman
might
have
a
dependent
husband.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we
think
reed
against
reed
is
distinguishable.
let
me
just
addressed
myself
to
the
statistical
basis
for
a
statement
that
the
majority
of
women
are
dependent
upon
their
husbands.
the
aclu
cites
in
their
brief
the
fact
that
60%
of
all
women
living
with
their
husbands
are
gainfully
employed.
well,
the
converse
of
this
fact
of
course
is
that
40%
of
all
married
women
are
not
employed.
moreover,
of
those
who
work,
as
other
figures
cited
in
the
aclu
brief
indicate,
only
a
portion
work
full
time.
in
preparing
this
for
this
argument
i
looked
at
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
the
figure
in
their
brief
was
that
43%
of
women
are
in
the
labor
force
and
18%
work
full
time.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
at
page
45
of
the
aclu
brief.
in
the
statistical
abstract
of
the
united
states
which
is
a
document
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
a
table
that
shows
that
in
1970,
in
white
families
where
both
the
husband
and
wife
worked
and
the
husband
is
under
35;
the
main
contribution
of
the
wife
to
the
total
family
income
was
27.1%.
that’s
at
the
table
at
page
327
of
the
statistical
abstract.
in
comparable,
black
families,
the
main
contribution
the
wife
was
slightly
higher
at
33.4%.
in
short,
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
husbands
still
provide
the
primary
income
in
most
families.
in
many
families,
they
provide
the
only
income.
in
the
remaining
families,
their
aggregate
contribution
to
the
total
family
income,
totally
eclipses
the
aggregate
contribution
of
working
wives.
now,
if
that
is
true
today,
we
submit
that
23
years
ago
and
17
years
ago
when
the
statutes
here
were
passed,
it
was
even
true
to
a
greater
extent.
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
it
can
hardly
be
disputed
that
most
men
are
not
dependent
upon
their
wives.
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
almost
all
married
work
and
in
families
were
both
the
husband
and
the
wife
work,
the
husband’s
income
is
generally
well
above
the
wife's.
mr.
samuel
huntington
they
fill
out
a
form
listing
their
expenses.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
huntington
that,
i
believe
that
probably
is.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
for
a
million
and
a
half
men
to
have
to
examine
a
million
and
a
half
forms,
i
submit
would
be
an
administrative
burden
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
making
an
affidavit
and
then
somebody
reading
it
and
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
it’s
justified,
i
think
that’s
--
that
is
exactly
what’s
involved.
i
suppose
that
if
evidence
came
to
the
military's
attention
that
the
affidavit
was
false
then
you
would
have
to
investigate
further.
mr.
samuel
huntington
you
mean
deny
them
benefits
altogether?
not
even
give
them
a
chance
to
show
that
they
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
or
treat
them
the
way
the
men;
well,
certainly
congress
could
do
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--
and
the
proposal
before
congress
in
the
last
congress
and
it
probably
be
resubmitted
at
this
time
is
to
amend
the
statute
to
treat
women
exactly
the
same
way.
what
i’m
saying
here
is
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
that
would
--
there
would
be
no
requirement
--
dependency
benefits
for
spouse
and
minor
children
would
be
conferred
automatically
both
on
men
and
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh,
yes,
that’s
right.
but
we
submit
that
while
that
may
be
a
good
suggestion
and
congress
may
adopt
it
but
there
is
rational
basis,
for
the
classification
made
in
the
statutes,
and
it
is
the
difference
statistical
characteristics
of
married
military
men
as
a
group
compared
with
not
married
military
women
as
a
group
which
justify
the
different
treatment
here.
mr.
samuel
huntington
you
mean
consistent
for
40
years?
no,
as
i
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
the
statistics
i
gave
were
for
the
current
year
or
in
the
last
couple
of
years.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
statute
was
based
on
the
situation
20
years
ago
and
as
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
there
is
not.
the
legislative
history
simply
indicates
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
statute
was
designed
to
give
dependent
--
to
give
benefits
for
dependence.
now
what
i
am
stating
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it’s
not
even
that.
i
mean
the
statute
speaks
for
itself
on
that
point.
the
only
thing
in
the
legislative
history
is
that
by
giving
allowances
for
dependents,
you
would
compensate
military
personnel
better
so
that
you
could
compete
with
the
civilian
sector
of
the
economy.
now,
i
still
say
that
it
is
apparent
that
congress
wrestled
with
the
question
of
how
do
you
determine
who’s
the
dependent.
and
that
it
was
rational
for
them
to
determine
that
in
the
case
of
men
you
assume
that
wives
are
dependent
automatically
because
treating
the
class
of
men
as
a
whole
that
is
generally
true.
treating
the
class
of
women
it
is
--
it
is
generally
not
true.
mr.
samuel
huntington
right,
but
we
submit
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
submit
it’s
a
rational
basis.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
submit
it
is
a
rational
basis
because
there’s
statistical
differences
between
the
two
classes
which
justify
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
said
the
legislative
history
doesn’t
indicate
that
they
–
they
--
they
looked
at
it.
the
legislative
history
is
fairly
silent.
i
say,
you
don’t
have
to
go
very
far
to
find
an
underlying
rational
here.
i
think
that
this
is
fairly
apparent.
i
don’t
believe
this
is
the
type
of
case
where
you
have
to
strain
your
imagination
to
dream
up
some
conceivable
rational
behind
the
statute.
i
think
the
rational
as
i’ve
indicated
is
one
which
if
it
doesn’t
lead
back
from
the
statute
is
one
which
is
fairly
apparent.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
would
submit
simply
that
there
are
statistical
differences
here
which
do
justify
the
different
treatment.
i’d
like
to
turn
now
to
the
reed
and
reed
case.
in
that
case,
as
you
will
recall
the
court
reviewed
an
idaho
statute
which
provided
that
when
competing
applications
to
administer
an
estate
were
filed
by
a
man
and
a
woman
in
the
same
priority
group,
the
man
was
to
be
given
preference
and
appointed.
now
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
men
as
a
class
were
better
administrators
than
women
and
the
court
rejected
the
contention
that
measure
was
justified
to
save
litigation
costs.
in
short,
there
are
no
differences
in
the
two
classes
of
applicants,
men
and
women
which
justify
the
discrimination.
by
contrast,
there
are
very
real
and
relevant
statistical
differences
between
married
military
men
as
a
class
and
married
women
which
justify
the,
in
our
view
justify
the
classifications
under
review
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standard
to
be
applied
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
determine
the
validity
of
these
statutes.
to
begin
with,
as
this
court
has
held
a
numerous
cases,
traditional
principles
of
equal
protection
developed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
relevant
in
considering
a
tax
under
the
fifth
amended
alleging
that
federal
statutes
unjustifiably
discriminate
between
different
classes
of
individuals.
now
as
already
as
been
touched
upon
here
today,
the
traditional
equal
protection
tests
is
the
rational
basis
test.
although
originally
developed
in
cases
involving
statutes
regulating
business,
the
test
has
been
applied
in
recent
years
to
cases
involving
economic
and
social
benefits.
now
as
both
mr.
levin
and
professor
ginsburg
have
pointed
out,
the
court
has
imposed
a
stricter
standard
of
review
with
respect
to
statutory
classifications
in
two
types
of
cases;
those
involving
classifications
which
affect
fundamental
personal
rights
and
those
involving
inherently
suspect
classifications.
as
far
as
the
personal
rights
are
concerned,
i
would
disagree
with
mr.
levin
that
personal
rights
of
the
type
which
bring
in
to
play
this,
the
standard
are
involved
here,
the
rights
are
two
dependency
benefits.
these
are
the
same
type
of
economic
benefits
which
were
under
review
in
the
dandridge
case
and
i
think
it’s
not
the
type
of
personal
rights
which
were
under
consideration
in
the
weber
case
which
involved
the
relationship
between
illegitimate
children
and
legitimate
children
within
the
family
unit.
the
rights
here
so
we
would
say
that
the
stricter
review
if
it’s
going
to
apply
at
all
in
this
case,
it
must
be
because
sex
is
a
suspect
classification.
let
me
just
comment
briefly
on
professor
gunther’s
article
in
the
harvard
law
review.
he
suggested
there
that
in
recent
cases,
this
court
has
not
been
limited
simply
to
one,
the
polar
extremes.
but
that
in
reviewing
statutes
the
court
has
been
taking
a
fairly
close
look
even
when
applying
the
rational
basis
test
to
determine
whether
there
is
in
fact
some
government
interest
involved
which
can
--
which
is
readily
apparent
and
you
don’t
have
to
stretch
the
imagination
to
come
up
with
it.
we
would
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
classifications
here
would
stand
scrutiny
under
that
type
of
approach.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
professor
ginsburg’s
argument
that
classifications
based
on
sex
are
suspect
for
equal
protection
and
due
process
purposes.
to
begin
with,
as
professor
ginsburg
acknowledges,
this
court
has
never
treated
classifications
based
on
sex
as
inherently
suspect.
and
only
last
term
in
reed
against
reed
applied
the
traditional
rational
basis
test.
in
our
view,
the
court
should
not
now
abandon
the
traditional
test
and
treat
sex
classifications
as
suspect.
just
last
week
in
the
crest
(ph)
decision,
which
upheld
the
$50
filing
fee
for
requirement
as
a
pre-condition
to
discharge
and
bankruptcy,
the
court
referred
to
the
suspect
criteria
of
race,
nationality,
and
alienage.
now,
race
classifications
of
course
have
an
especially
disfavored
status
in
our
constitutional
history.
and
each
of
the
three
classifications
in
the
words
of
justice
blackmun
in
graham
against
richardson
involves
and
i
quote
“a
discreet
and
insular
minority
for
whom
heightened
judicial
solicitude
is
appropriate.”
now
these
minorities
generally
lack
the
political
power
to
protect
their
own
interest.
now,
we
are
not
contending
that
women
have
achieved
equal
political
power
with
men.
the
statistics
cited
by
professor
ginsburg
as
to
the
number
of
women
in
high
government
positions
in
state
and
federal
legislatures
are
certainly
not
in
dispute,
they’re
very
small.
what
we
do
suggest
is
that
because
they
are
a
numerical
majority
in
the
population
as
a
whole,
they
have
been
exercising
substantial
and
growing
political
influence
upon
state
and
federal
legislatures.
at
the
federal
level,
as
summarized
in
the
aclu’s
brief,
there
has
been
considerable
legislative
activity
in
amending
statutes
containing
classifications
based
on
sex.
proposed
legislation
to
amend
these
statutes
as
i’ve
already
stated,
was
before
congress
last
year
and
undoubtedly
will
be
before
congress
this
year.
and
also
of
course
the
equal
rights
amendment
which
was
passed
last
year
is
evidence
--
is
an
indication
of
the
influence
that
women
who
favor
the
amendment
have
been
able
to
exert.
there
is
another
reason
for
not
expanding
the
category
of
suspect
classifications
to
include
women.
unlike
classifications
based
on
race,
nationality,
or
alienage,
classifications
based
on
sex
frequently
are
not
arbitrary,
but
reflect
the
actual
differences
between
the
sexes
which
are
relevant
to
the
purpose
of
the
statutes
containing
the
classifications.
now,
we
contend
here
that
the
dependency
statutes,
for
example,
do
not
discriminate
against
women
because
of
their
femininity.
they
treat
women
differently
because
women
as
a
class
are
less
likely
to
have
dependents
than
men.
similarly,
the
florida
statute
upheld
that
hoyt
against
florida
did
not
excuse
women
from
jury
duty
because
they
were
inferior,
but
excused
them
because
of
the
fact
that
women
as
class
were
more
likely
than
men
to
have
family
responsibilities,
making
it
impractical
for
them
to
serve
as
jurors.
application
of
the
rational
basis
test
permits
the
courts
to
consider
statutes
on
a
case
by
case
basis
to
determine
which
classifications
are
based
on
valid
factual
or
physiological
differences
between
the
sexes
and
which
classifications
like
the
one
struck
down
in
reed
and
reed
are
arbitrary
and
not
based
on
sex
differences.
on
the
other
hand,
denominating
sex
classifications
as
suspect
would
subject
all
statutes
containing
sex
classifications
to
strict
review
and
could
result
in
invalidating
many
of
them
whether
or
not
individual
classifications
reflect
acknowledged
factual
or
physiological
differences.
mr.
samuel
huntington
dependence
as
defined
--
yes,
dependence
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
in
terms
of
dependent
spouses,
that’s
what
i
mean.
well,
in
closing,
let
me
simply
state
that
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
drive
of
any
women
to
achieve
equality
by
attacking
statutes
enacted
in
a
different
era
that
may
reflect
antiquated
notions
of
the
respective
roles
of
the
sexes.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
plea
for
across
the
board
change
rather
than
case
by
case
consideration
is
better
addressed
to
the
legislature
rather
than
to
the
courts.
in
conclusion,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
understand
the
consequence
would
be
that
you
would
extend
the
same
benefits
to
women.
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
you
would
strike
down
the
portion
of
the
statute
which
says
that
women
have
to
establish
dependency
in
fact
in
order
to
claim
their
wife
as
a
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
you
wouldn’t
strike.
you
would
only
strike
down
the
part
that
requires
them
to
establish
dependency
in
fact
in
order
to
claim
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
males
must
--
well,
i
would
think
that
would
definitely
not
be
the
preferable
alternative.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
inquiry
here
would
be
what
congress
would
have
wished
had
it
been
faced
with
the
situation
of
not
being
able
to
make
this
classification
and
i
think
that
the
conclusion
would
have
to
be
that
they
would
wish
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right.
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
just
in
this
narrow
context.
mr.
samuel
huntington
in
section
--
in
43
--
37
u.s.c.
401.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
no,
just
within
the
definition
part
itself
would
be
the
only
--
if
you
simply
said
that
the
same
standard
have
to
apply
to
women
as
applies
to
men.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
that
would
fly
right
in
the
face
of
the
purpose
of
congress
in
adopting
the
dependency
benefits
statutes
to
be
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh,
yes,
but
well
i
think
the
numbers
[attempt
to
laughter]
are
quite
relevant
when
you’re
talking
about
a
million
and
a
half
men
and
only
a
couple
of
a
thousand
women
married
to
civilians.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we
don’t
want
you
to
strike
that
and
we
don’t
want
you
to
require
that
the
men’s
applications
for
dependency
allowances
be
examined
in
each
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
if
you
just
struck
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
sentence.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
“his”
means
her
in
this
context.
at
least
in
certain
areas
--[laughter]
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
if
the
statute
has
always
been
construed
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
mean
take
the
next
one,
his
unmarried
legitimate
child.
mr.
samuel
huntington
then
why
do
a
complete
job.
you
can
do
it
but
the
way
--[laughter]
--
but
the
way
the
statute
has
been
construed
is
interchangeable
with
her
and
his.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
you
could
certainly
assume
that
and
we’re
not
suggesting
that
you
do
that.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
first
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
different
treatment
of
male
and
female
members
of
the
armed
forces
in
the
statute
here
under
review.
and
second,
that
the
rational
basis
standard
is
the
proper
standard
for
determining
the
validity
of
those
statutes.
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
statutes
and
then
discuss
the
appropriate
standard
of
review.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
begin
by
reviewing
the
actual
impact
of
the
housing
allowance
and
medical
care
statutes
here
in
issue.
the
housing
allowance
statute
is
37
u.s.c.
403
grants
a
basic
housing
allowance
to
each
member
of
the
military
for
whom
on-base
housing
is
not
available.
in
addition,
each
such
member
is
entitled
to
an
increased
housing
allowance
if
he
has
one
or
more
dependents
as
defined
by
37
u.s.c.
401.
under
the
scale
which
is
now
in
existence,
for
example,
a
lieutenant
in
pay
grade
ii
would
be
entitled
to
$138.60
for
--
per
month
for
housing
without
dependents
and
$175.80
with
dependents,
a
difference
of
$37.20.
now,
the
particular
issue
here
of
course
concerns
under
what
circumstances
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
may
claim
a
spouse
as
a
dependent.
and
the
general
rule
under
the
statute
is
that
wives
of
male
members
qualified
automatically
for
dependency
benefits,
whereas
husbands
of
female
members
qualify
only
if
dependent
in
fact
on
their
wives
for
over
half
of
their
support.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
it
applies
to
everyone.
mr.
samuel
huntington
there
is
an
amount.
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
would
like
to
point
out,
now
first
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
right.
housing
is
available
and
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
right.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
under
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
didn’t
mean
to
imply
that.
no,
it’s
--[attempt
to
laughter]
the
--
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
under
37
u.s.c.
420
in
the
case
of
an
inter-service
marriage,
neither
the
husband
nor
the
wife
may
claim
his
or
her
spouse
as
a
dependent.
now,
this
fact
has
considerable
importance
here
for
a
significant
majority
of
married
women
in
the
armed
force
are
married
to
military
men.
now
while
the
record
is
silent
on
this
matter,
the
senate
report
issued
on
the
proposals
in
congress
last
year
to
amend
these
statutes
contained
a
letter
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
department
of
defense
which
is
in
point.
in
the
letter,
at
page
4
of
the
report
that’s
senate
report
92-1218,
it
is
noted
that
a
recently
completed
survey
of
married
women
in
the
air
force
show
that
25%
of
the
officers
were
married,
but
that
only
4%
of
the
officers
were
married
to
civilians
and
the
percentage
of
all
women
in
the
air
force
married
to
civilians
is
even
smaller.
in
not
being
able
to
claim
their
husbands
as
dependents,
military
women
married
to
military
men
are
not
discriminated
against
since
their
husbands
could
not
claim
them
either.
similarly,
a
female
member
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
that
would
be
--[laughter]
mr.
samuel
huntington
one
way,
yes.
well,
this
is
also
true
that
these
women
who
married
the
military
men
are
not
discriminated
with
respect
to
medical
benefits
because
under
10
u.s.c.
1074
both
the
husband
and
the
wife
would
qualify
for
medical
benefits.
well,
in
short
then
the
only
women
who
are
treated
differently
then
their
male
counterparts
are
those
women
who
are
married
to
civilian.
now,
in
our
view,
one
does
not
have
to
search
far
to
discover
a
rational
basis
for
congress’
decision
to
treat
married
men
and
married
women
differently
with
respect
to
dependency
benefits.
we
start
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
two
statutes.
and
the
basic
purpose
is
to
provide
housing
allowance
and
medical
benefits
for
dependents
in
order
to
establish
a
compensation
pattern
which
would
attract
career
personnel
into
the
armed
forces.
in
congress’
view,
this
would
enable
the
military
to
compete
with
the
civilian
sector
of
the
economy
for
married
people.
now
in
establishing
these
benefits,
congress
had
to
determine
what
proof
of
dependency
it
would
require.
now,
an
examination
of
this
statute
shows
that
where
it
was
very
likely
that
a
military
person
would
be
supporting
certain
relatives,
dependency
benefits
were
conferred
automatically
where
it
would
be
less
likely
or
unusual
that
a
military
member
would
be
supporting
a
person,
proof
of
dependency
was
required.
thus,
under
37
u.s.c.
401,
a
serviceman’s
wife
and
minor
children
automatically
qualify
for
dependency
benefits,
whereas,
his
older
children
and
his
parents
would
qualify
only
if
dependent
in
fact.
and
since
women,
generally
do
not
provide
the
main
support
for
their
husbands,
children,
or
parents,
servicewomen
were
required
to
establish
to
establish
dependency
in
fact
in
each
case.
let
me
state
this
in
other
way.
taking
the
over
one
million
married
military
men
as
a
group,
a
significant
majority
of
their
wives
are
the
dependent
upon
them.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
rational
to
decide
to
grant
all
married
men
dependency
benefits
for
their
wives
automatically
rather
than
undertaking
the
heavy
administrative
burden
of
determining
dependency
in
fact
in
each
case.
on
the
other
hand,
taking
the
one
or
two
thousand
military
women
who
are
married
to
civilians
as
a
group,
an
overwhelming
majority
of
their
husbands
are
not
dependent
upon
them.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
rational
to
examine
individually
the
few
instances
where
a
military
woman
might
have
a
dependent
husband.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we
think
reed
against
reed
is
distinguishable.
let
me
just
addressed
myself
to
the
statistical
basis
for
a
statement
that
the
majority
of
women
are
dependent
upon
their
husbands.
the
aclu
cites
in
their
brief
the
fact
that
60%
of
all
women
living
with
their
husbands
are
gainfully
employed.
well,
the
converse
of
this
fact
of
course
is
that
40%
of
all
married
women
are
not
employed.
moreover,
of
those
who
work,
as
other
figures
cited
in
the
aclu
brief
indicate,
only
a
portion
work
full
time.
in
preparing
this
for
this
argument
i
looked
at
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
the
figure
in
their
brief
was
that
43%
of
women
are
in
the
labor
force
and
18%
work
full
time.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
at
page
45
of
the
aclu
brief.
in
the
statistical
abstract
of
the
united
states
which
is
a
document
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
a
table
that
shows
that
in
1970,
in
white
families
where
both
the
husband
and
wife
worked
and
the
husband
is
under
35;
the
main
contribution
of
the
wife
to
the
total
family
income
was
27.1%.
that’s
at
the
table
at
page
327
of
the
statistical
abstract.
in
comparable,
black
families,
the
main
contribution
the
wife
was
slightly
higher
at
33.4%.
in
short,
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
husbands
still
provide
the
primary
income
in
most
families.
in
many
families,
they
provide
the
only
income.
in
the
remaining
families,
their
aggregate
contribution
to
the
total
family
income,
totally
eclipses
the
aggregate
contribution
of
working
wives.
now,
if
that
is
true
today,
we
submit
that
23
years
ago
and
17
years
ago
when
the
statutes
here
were
passed,
it
was
even
true
to
a
greater
extent.
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
it
can
hardly
be
disputed
that
most
men
are
not
dependent
upon
their
wives.
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
almost
all
married
work
and
in
families
were
both
the
husband
and
the
wife
work,
the
husband’s
income
is
generally
well
above
the
wife's.
mr.
samuel
huntington
they
fill
out
a
form
listing
their
expenses.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
huntington
that,
i
believe
that
probably
is.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
for
a
million
and
a
half
men
to
have
to
examine
a
million
and
a
half
forms,
i
submit
would
be
an
administrative
burden
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
making
an
affidavit
and
then
somebody
reading
it
and
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
it’s
justified,
i
think
that’s
--
that
is
exactly
what’s
involved.
i
suppose
that
if
evidence
came
to
the
military's
attention
that
the
affidavit
was
false
then
you
would
have
to
investigate
further.
mr.
samuel
huntington
you
mean
deny
them
benefits
altogether?
not
even
give
them
a
chance
to
show
that
they
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
or
treat
them
the
way
the
men;
well,
certainly
congress
could
do
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--
and
the
proposal
before
congress
in
the
last
congress
and
it
probably
be
resubmitted
at
this
time
is
to
amend
the
statute
to
treat
women
exactly
the
same
way.
what
i’m
saying
here
is
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
that
would
--
there
would
be
no
requirement
--
dependency
benefits
for
spouse
and
minor
children
would
be
conferred
automatically
both
on
men
and
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh,
yes,
that’s
right.
but
we
submit
that
while
that
may
be
a
good
suggestion
and
congress
may
adopt
it
but
there
is
rational
basis,
for
the
classification
made
in
the
statutes,
and
it
is
the
difference
statistical
characteristics
of
married
military
men
as
a
group
compared
with
not
married
military
women
as
a
group
which
justify
the
different
treatment
here.
mr.
samuel
huntington
you
mean
consistent
for
40
years?
no,
as
i
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
the
statistics
i
gave
were
for
the
current
year
or
in
the
last
couple
of
years.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
statute
was
based
on
the
situation
20
years
ago
and
as
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
there
is
not.
the
legislative
history
simply
indicates
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
statute
was
designed
to
give
dependent
--
to
give
benefits
for
dependence.
now
what
i
am
stating
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it’s
not
even
that.
i
mean
the
statute
speaks
for
itself
on
that
point.
the
only
thing
in
the
legislative
history
is
that
by
giving
allowances
for
dependents,
you
would
compensate
military
personnel
better
so
that
you
could
compete
with
the
civilian
sector
of
the
economy.
now,
i
still
say
that
it
is
apparent
that
congress
wrestled
with
the
question
of
how
do
you
determine
who’s
the
dependent.
and
that
it
was
rational
for
them
to
determine
that
in
the
case
of
men
you
assume
that
wives
are
dependent
automatically
because
treating
the
class
of
men
as
a
whole
that
is
generally
true.
treating
the
class
of
women
it
is
--
it
is
generally
not
true.
mr.
samuel
huntington
right,
but
we
submit
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
submit
it’s
a
rational
basis.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
submit
it
is
a
rational
basis
because
there’s
statistical
differences
between
the
two
classes
which
justify
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
said
the
legislative
history
doesn’t
indicate
that
they
–
they
--
they
looked
at
it.
the
legislative
history
is
fairly
silent.
i
say,
you
don’t
have
to
go
very
far
to
find
an
underlying
rational
here.
i
think
that
this
is
fairly
apparent.
i
don’t
believe
this
is
the
type
of
case
where
you
have
to
strain
your
imagination
to
dream
up
some
conceivable
rational
behind
the
statute.
i
think
the
rational
as
i’ve
indicated
is
one
which
if
it
doesn’t
lead
back
from
the
statute
is
one
which
is
fairly
apparent.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
would
submit
simply
that
there
are
statistical
differences
here
which
do
justify
the
different
treatment.
i’d
like
to
turn
now
to
the
reed
and
reed
case.
in
that
case,
as
you
will
recall
the
court
reviewed
an
idaho
statute
which
provided
that
when
competing
applications
to
administer
an
estate
were
filed
by
a
man
and
a
woman
in
the
same
priority
group,
the
man
was
to
be
given
preference
and
appointed.
now
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
men
as
a
class
were
better
administrators
than
women
and
the
court
rejected
the
contention
that
measure
was
justified
to
save
litigation
costs.
in
short,
there
are
no
differences
in
the
two
classes
of
applicants,
men
and
women
which
justify
the
discrimination.
by
contrast,
there
are
very
real
and
relevant
statistical
differences
between
married
military
men
as
a
class
and
married
women
which
justify
the,
in
our
view
justify
the
classifications
under
review
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standard
to
be
applied
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
determine
the
validity
of
these
statutes.
to
begin
with,
as
this
court
has
held
a
numerous
cases,
traditional
principles
of
equal
protection
developed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
relevant
in
considering
a
tax
under
the
fifth
amended
alleging
that
federal
statutes
unjustifiably
discriminate
between
different
classes
of
individuals.
now
as
already
as
been
touched
upon
here
today,
the
traditional
equal
protection
tests
is
the
rational
basis
test.
although
originally
developed
in
cases
involving
statutes
regulating
business,
the
test
has
been
applied
in
recent
years
to
cases
involving
economic
and
social
benefits.
now
as
both
mr.
levin
and
professor
ginsburg
have
pointed
out,
the
court
has
imposed
a
stricter
standard
of
review
with
respect
to
statutory
classifications
in
two
types
of
cases;
those
involving
classifications
which
affect
fundamental
personal
rights
and
those
involving
inherently
suspect
classifications.
as
far
as
the
personal
rights
are
concerned,
i
would
disagree
with
mr.
levin
that
personal
rights
of
the
type
which
bring
in
to
play
this,
the
standard
are
involved
here,
the
rights
are
two
dependency
benefits.
these
are
the
same
type
of
economic
benefits
which
were
under
review
in
the
dandridge
case
and
i
think
it’s
not
the
type
of
personal
rights
which
were
under
consideration
in
the
weber
case
which
involved
the
relationship
between
illegitimate
children
and
legitimate
children
within
the
family
unit.
the
rights
here
so
we
would
say
that
the
stricter
review
if
it’s
going
to
apply
at
all
in
this
case,
it
must
be
because
sex
is
a
suspect
classification.
let
me
just
comment
briefly
on
professor
gunther’s
article
in
the
harvard
law
review.
he
suggested
there
that
in
recent
cases,
this
court
has
not
been
limited
simply
to
one,
the
polar
extremes.
but
that
in
reviewing
statutes
the
court
has
been
taking
a
fairly
close
look
even
when
applying
the
rational
basis
test
to
determine
whether
there
is
in
fact
some
government
interest
involved
which
can
--
which
is
readily
apparent
and
you
don’t
have
to
stretch
the
imagination
to
come
up
with
it.
we
would
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
classifications
here
would
stand
scrutiny
under
that
type
of
approach.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
professor
ginsburg’s
argument
that
classifications
based
on
sex
are
suspect
for
equal
protection
and
due
process
purposes.
to
begin
with,
as
professor
ginsburg
acknowledges,
this
court
has
never
treated
classifications
based
on
sex
as
inherently
suspect.
and
only
last
term
in
reed
against
reed
applied
the
traditional
rational
basis
test.
in
our
view,
the
court
should
not
now
abandon
the
traditional
test
and
treat
sex
classifications
as
suspect.
just
last
week
in
the
crest
(ph)
decision,
which
upheld
the
$50
filing
fee
for
requirement
as
a
pre-condition
to
discharge
and
bankruptcy,
the
court
referred
to
the
suspect
criteria
of
race,
nationality,
and
alienage.
now,
race
classifications
of
course
have
an
especially
disfavored
status
in
our
constitutional
history.
and
each
of
the
three
classifications
in
the
words
of
justice
blackmun
in
graham
against
richardson
involves
and
i
quote
“a
discreet
and
insular
minority
for
whom
heightened
judicial
solicitude
is
appropriate.”
now
these
minorities
generally
lack
the
political
power
to
protect
their
own
interest.
now,
we
are
not
contending
that
women
have
achieved
equal
political
power
with
men.
the
statistics
cited
by
professor
ginsburg
as
to
the
number
of
women
in
high
government
positions
in
state
and
federal
legislatures
are
certainly
not
in
dispute,
they’re
very
small.
what
we
do
suggest
is
that
because
they
are
a
numerical
majority
in
the
population
as
a
whole,
they
have
been
exercising
substantial
and
growing
political
influence
upon
state
and
federal
legislatures.
at
the
federal
level,
as
summarized
in
the
aclu’s
brief,
there
has
been
considerable
legislative
activity
in
amending
statutes
containing
classifications
based
on
sex.
proposed
legislation
to
amend
these
statutes
as
i’ve
already
stated,
was
before
congress
last
year
and
undoubtedly
will
be
before
congress
this
year.
and
also
of
course
the
equal
rights
amendment
which
was
passed
last
year
is
evidence
--
is
an
indication
of
the
influence
that
women
who
favor
the
amendment
have
been
able
to
exert.
there
is
another
reason
for
not
expanding
the
category
of
suspect
classifications
to
include
women.
unlike
classifications
based
on
race,
nationality,
or
alienage,
classifications
based
on
sex
frequently
are
not
arbitrary,
but
reflect
the
actual
differences
between
the
sexes
which
are
relevant
to
the
purpose
of
the
statutes
containing
the
classifications.
now,
we
contend
here
that
the
dependency
statutes,
for
example,
do
not
discriminate
against
women
because
of
their
femininity.
they
treat
women
differently
because
women
as
a
class
are
less
likely
to
have
dependents
than
men.
similarly,
the
florida
statute
upheld
that
hoyt
against
florida
did
not
excuse
women
from
jury
duty
because
they
were
inferior,
but
excused
them
because
of
the
fact
that
women
as
class
were
more
likely
than
men
to
have
family
responsibilities,
making
it
impractical
for
them
to
serve
as
jurors.
application
of
the
rational
basis
test
permits
the
courts
to
consider
statutes
on
a
case
by
case
basis
to
determine
which
classifications
are
based
on
valid
factual
or
physiological
differences
between
the
sexes
and
which
classifications
like
the
one
struck
down
in
reed
and
reed
are
arbitrary
and
not
based
on
sex
differences.
on
the
other
hand,
denominating
sex
classifications
as
suspect
would
subject
all
statutes
containing
sex
classifications
to
strict
review
and
could
result
in
invalidating
many
of
them
whether
or
not
individual
classifications
reflect
acknowledged
factual
or
physiological
differences.
mr.
samuel
huntington
dependence
as
defined
--
yes,
dependence
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
in
terms
of
dependent
spouses,
that’s
what
i
mean.
well,
in
closing,
let
me
simply
state
that
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
drive
of
any
women
to
achieve
equality
by
attacking
statutes
enacted
in
a
different
era
that
may
reflect
antiquated
notions
of
the
respective
roles
of
the
sexes.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
plea
for
across
the
board
change
rather
than
case
by
case
consideration
is
better
addressed
to
the
legislature
rather
than
to
the
courts.
in
conclusion,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
understand
the
consequence
would
be
that
you
would
extend
the
same
benefits
to
women.
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
you
would
strike
down
the
portion
of
the
statute
which
says
that
women
have
to
establish
dependency
in
fact
in
order
to
claim
their
wife
as
a
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
you
wouldn’t
strike.
you
would
only
strike
down
the
part
that
requires
them
to
establish
dependency
in
fact
in
order
to
claim
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
males
must
--
well,
i
would
think
that
would
definitely
not
be
the
preferable
alternative.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
inquiry
here
would
be
what
congress
would
have
wished
had
it
been
faced
with
the
situation
of
not
being
able
to
make
this
classification
and
i
think
that
the
conclusion
would
have
to
be
that
they
would
wish
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right.
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
just
in
this
narrow
context.
mr.
samuel
huntington
in
section
--
in
43
--
37
u.s.c.
401.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
no,
just
within
the
definition
part
itself
would
be
the
only
--
if
you
simply
said
that
the
same
standard
have
to
apply
to
women
as
applies
to
men.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
that
would
fly
right
in
the
face
of
the
purpose
of
congress
in
adopting
the
dependency
benefits
statutes
to
be
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh,
yes,
but
well
i
think
the
numbers
[attempt
to
laughter]
are
quite
relevant
when
you’re
talking
about
a
million
and
a
half
men
and
only
a
couple
of
a
thousand
women
married
to
civilians.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we
don’t
want
you
to
strike
that
and
we
don’t
want
you
to
require
that
the
men’s
applications
for
dependency
allowances
be
examined
in
each
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
if
you
just
struck
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
sentence.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
“his”
means
her
in
this
context.
at
least
in
certain
areas
--[laughter]
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
if
the
statute
has
always
been
construed
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
mean
take
the
next
one,
his
unmarried
legitimate
child.
mr.
samuel
huntington
then
why
do
a
complete
job.
you
can
do
it
but
the
way
--[laughter]
--
but
the
way
the
statute
has
been
construed
is
interchangeable
with
her
and
his.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
you
could
certainly
assume
that
and
we’re
not
suggesting
that
you
do
that.
thank
you.
