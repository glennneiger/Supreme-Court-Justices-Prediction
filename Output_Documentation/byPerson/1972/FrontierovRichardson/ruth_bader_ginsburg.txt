and

amicus
views
this
case
as
kin
to
reed
v.
reed
404
u.s.
the
legislative
judgment
in
both
derives
from
the
same
stereotype.
the
man
is
or
should
be
the
independent
partner
in
a
marital
unit.
the
woman
with
an
occasional
exception
is
dependent,
sheltered
from
bread
winning
experience.
appellees
stated
in
answer
to
interrogatories
in
this
case
that
they
remained
totally
uninformed
on
the
application
of
this
stereotype
to
serve
as
families
that
is
they
do
not
know
whether
the
proportion
of
wage-earning
wives
of
servicemen
is
small,
large,
or
middle
size.
what
is
known
is
that
by
employing
the
sex
criterion,
identically
situated
persons
are
treated
differently.
the
married
serviceman
gets
benefits
for
himself,
as
well
as
his
spouse
regardless
of
her
income.
the
married
servicewoman
is
denied
medical
care
for
her
spouse
and
quarter's
allowance
for
herself
as
well
as
her
spouse
even
if
as
in
this
case,
she
supplies
over
two-thirds
the
support
of
the
marital
unit.
for
these
reasons,
amicus
believes
that
the
sex-related
means
employed
by
congress
fails
to
meet
the
rationality
standard.
it
does
not
have
a
fair
and
substantial
relationship
to
the
legislative
objective
so
that
all
similarly
circumstanced
persons
shall
be
treated
alike.
nonetheless,
amicus
urges
the
court
to
recognize
in
this
case
what
it
has
in
others,
that
it
writes
not
only
for
this
case
and
this
day
alone,
but
for
this
type
of
case.
as
is
apparent
from
the
decisions
cited
at
pages
27
to
34
of
our
brief,
in
lower
federal
as
well
as
state
courts,
the
standard
of
review
in
sex
discrimination
cases
is
to
say
the
least
confused.
a
few
courts
have
ranked
sex
as
a
suspect
criterion.
others,
including
apparently
the
court
below
in
this
case,
seem
to
regard
the
reed
decision
as
a
direction
to
apply
minimal
scrutiny
and
there
are
various
shades
between.
the
result
is
that
in
many
instances,
the
same
or
similar
issues
are
decided
differently
depending
upon
the
court’s
view
of
the
stringency
of
review
appropriate.
to
provide
the
guidance
so
badly
needed
and
because
recognition
is
long
overdue,
amicus
urges
the
court
to
declare
sex
a
suspect
criterion.
this
would
not
be
quite
the
giant
step
appellee
suggests.
as
professor
gunther
observed
in
an
analysis
of
last
term’s
equal
protection
decisions
published
in
the
november
1972
harvard
law
review,
it
appears
that
in
reed,
some
special
suspicion
of
sex
as
a
classification
factor
entered
into
the
court’s
analysis.
appellees
concede
that
the
principle
ingredient
involving
strict
scrutiny
is
present
in
the
sex
criterion.
sex
like
race
is
a
visible,
immutable
characteristic
bearing
no
necessary
relationship
to
ability.
sex
like
race
has
been
made
the
basis
for
unjustified
or
at
least
unproved
assumptions,
concerning
an
individual’s
potential
to
perform
or
to
contribute
to
society.
but
appellees
point
out
that
although
the
essential
ingredient
rendering
a
classification
suspect
is
present,
sex-based
distinctions
unlike
racial
distinctions
do
not
have
an
especially
disfavored
constitutional
history.
it
is
clear
that
the
core
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
eliminate
invidious
racial
discrimination.
but
why
did
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
regard
racial
discrimination
as
odious.
because
a
person’s
skin
color
bears
no
necessary
relationship
to
ability,
similarly
as
appellees’
concede,
a
person’s
sex
bears
no
necessary
relationship
to
ability.
moreover,
national
origin
and
alienage
have
been
recognized
as
suspect
classifications,
although
the
new
comers
to
our
shores
was
not
the
paramount
concern
of
the
nation
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted.
but
the
main
thrust
of
the
argument
against
recognition
of
sex
as
a
suspect
criterion
centers
on
two
points.
first,
women
are
a
majority.
second,
legislative
classification
by
sex
does
not,
it
is
asserted,
imply
the
inferiority
of
women.
with
respect
to
the
numbers
argument,
the
numerical
majority
was
denied
even
the
right
to
vote
until
1920.
women
today
face
discrimination
in
employment
as
pervasive
and
more
subtle
than
discrimination
encountered
by
minority
groups.
in
vocational
and
higher
education,
women
continue
to
face
restrictive
quotas
no
longer
operative
with
respect
to
other
population
groups.
their
absence
is
conspicuous
in
federal
and
state
legislative,
executive,
and
judicial
chambers
in
higher
civil
service
positions
and
in
appointed
posts
in
federal,
state,
and
local
government.
surely,
no
one
would
suggest
that
race
is
not
a
suspect
criterion
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
the
black
population
here
outnumbers
the
white.
moreover,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
has
pointed
out
most
recently
in
hadley
against
alabama
41
law
week
3205,
equal
protection
and
due
process
of
law
apply
to
the
majority
as
well
as
to
the
minorities.
due
to
sex
classifications
listed
by
appellees
imply
a
judgment
of
inferiority.
even
the
court
below
suggested
that
they
do.
that
court
said
it
would
be
remiss
if
it
failed
to
notice
lurking
in
the
background
the
subtle
injury
inflicted
on
servicewomen,
the
indignity
of
being
treated
differently
so
many
of
them
feel.
sex
classifications
do
stigmatize
when
as
in
goesaert
against
cleary
235
u.s.,
they
exclude
women
from
an
occupation
thought
more
appropriate
to
men.
the
sex
criterion
stigmatizes
when
it
is
used
to
limit
hours
of
work
for
women
only.
hours
regulations
of
the
kind
involved
in
muller
against
oregon
though
perhaps
reasonable
on
the
turn
of
the
century
conditions,
today
protect
women
from
competing
for
extra
remuneration,
higher
paying
jobs,
promotions.
the
sex
criterion
stigmatizes
when
as
in
hoyt
against
florida
368
u.s,
it
assumes
that
all
women
are
preoccupied
with
home
and
children
and
therefore
should
be
spared
the
basic
civic
responsibility
of
serving
on
a
jury.
these
distinctions
have
a
common
effect.
they
help
keep
woman
in
her
place,
a
place
inferior
to
that
occupied
by
men
in
our
society.
appellees
recognize
that
there
is
doubt
as
to
the
contemporary
validity
of
the
theory
that
sex
classifications
do
not
brand
the
female
sex
as
inferior.
but
they
advocate
a
hold
the
line
position
by
this
court
unless
and
until
the
equal
rights
amendment
comes
into
force.
absent
the
equal
rights
amendment,
appellees
assert,
no
close
scrutiny
of
sex
based
classifications
is
warranted.
this
court
should
stand
pat
on
legislation
of
the
kind
involved
in
this
case.
legislation
making
a
distinction,
servicewomen
regard
as
the
most
frozen
equity,
the
greatest
irritant
and
the
most
discriminatory
provision
relating
to
women
in
the
middle
--
in
the
military
service.
but
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
notion
of
what
constitutes
equal
protection
does
change.
proponents
as
well
as
opponents
of
the
equal
rights
amendment
believe
that
clarification
of
the
application
of
equal
protection
to
the
sex
criterion
is
needed
and
should
come
from
this
court.
proponents
believe
that
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
would
secure
equal
rights
and
responsibilities
for
men
and
women.
but
they
also
stressed
that
such
interpretation
was
not
yet
discernible
and
in
any
event
the
amendment
would
serve
an
important
function
in
removing
even
the
slightest
doubt
that
equal
rights
for
men
and
women
is
fundamental
constitutional
principle.
in
asking
the
court
to
declare
sex
a
suspect
criterion,
amicus
urges
a
position
forcibly
stated
in
1837
by
sara
grimke,
noted
abolitionist
and
advocate
of
equal
rights
for
men
and
women.
she
spoke
not
elegantly,
but
with
unmistakable
clarity.
she
said,
“i
ask
no
favor
for
my
sex.
all
i
ask
of
our
brethren
is
that
they
take
their
feet
of
our
necks.”
in
conclusion,
amicus
joins
appellants
in
requesting
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
entered

and
remand
the
case
with
instructions
to
grant
the
