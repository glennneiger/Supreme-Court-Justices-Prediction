mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
sex
discrimination
case.
after
a
short
statement
of
the
facts
here,
i
will
seek
to
refute
the
government’s
statistical
analysis
of
the
case
and
point
to
what
we
consider
to
be
then
substantiability
of
the
government’s
interest
in
continuing
this
particular
sex
discrimination.
following
this,
i
will
speak
briefly
about
the
merits
of
judging
sex
classifications
by
what
we
consider
to
be
an
intermediate
test.
professor
ginsburg
to
my
left
will
then
speak
on
the
merits
of
judging
these
cases
by
standard
of
strict
scrutiny.
a
year
after
entering
the
armed
forces
in
1968,
lieutenant
sharron
frontiero
married
joseph
frontiero.
because
of
the
statutes
which
are
at
issue
here,
any
male
member
of
the
armed
forces
would
have
automatically
become
entitled
to
certain
housing
allowance
benefits
and
medical
benefits.
lieutenant
frontiero
did
not.
the
statutes
giving
males
in
the
armed
forces
the
irrebuttable
presumption,
that
their
spouses
are
dependent,
and
grant
benefits
regardless
of
the
wives’
actual
financial
dependency.
a
female
must
prove
that
her
spouse
is
in
fact
dependent
upon
her
for
more
than
one-half
of
his
support.
in
this
case,
lieutenant
frontiero
earns
more
than
three
times
as
much
as
her
husband
joseph.
her
income
is
approximately
$8,200.
his
income
is
just
a
little
in
excess
of
$2,800.
but
because
joseph’s
individual
expenses
are
low,
his
small
income
meets
more
than
half
of
his
personal
expenses.
now,
sharron
was
therefore
denied
any
supplemental
benefits
in
both
housing
and
medical
for
her
spouse.
it’s
undisputed
that
under
these
statutes,
the
ones
which
are
at
issue
here
that
male
armed
forces
member
would
have
received
this
housing
and
medical
benefits.
so
we
have
a
two-fold
discrimination.
the
first
is
procedural.
women
are
forced
to
the
burdens
and
uncertainties
of
proving
that
their
spouses
are
in
fact
dependent
upon
them
while
males
are
given
the
benefits
automatically
and
irrefutably.
but
more
importantly,
there’s
a
substantive
discrimination
here.
males
whose
wives
are
not
financially
dependent
upon
them,
nevertheless
receive
these
housing
and
medical
benefits.
women
in
precisely
the
same
circumstances,
identical
circumstances
do
not
receive
the
benefits.
and
the
government
really
seeks
to
explain
a
way
this
discrimination
by
saying
that
it’s
only
a
procedural
difference.
and
that
since
women
earn
less
than
men
that
they
can
presume
for
the
sake,
and
i’m
talking
about
women
in
the
general
population
that
they
can
presume
for
the
sake
of
administrative
convenience
or
administrative
ease
that
the
male
spouses
are
financially
dependent.
we
have
three
relatively
simple
answers
to
the
government’s
contention
that
lower
income
shows
dependency.
first
of
all,
earning
levels
don’t
alone
necessarily
indicate
dependency
only
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
think
that
earning
level,
not
necessary
even
a
general
tendency
i
would
think
that
you
could
say
that
in
the
whole
population
that
it
does
indicate
a
tendency
that
men
earn
more
than
women,
and
we
don’t
dispute
that.
we
don’t
dispute
that
at
all.
but
the
only
reason
that
joseph
frontiero’s
expense
that
the
--
only
because
his
expenses
are
low
as
he
is
technically
not
one-half
financially
dependent
upon
his
wife,
sharron
frontiero,
which
is
the
criteria
and
the
standard
that
women
are
forced
to
submit
to
under
these
statutes.
and
this
is
--
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
income
is
less
than
one-third
of
her
income.
so,
though
we
feel
that
income
and
expenses
are
relevant
in
this
case,
the
government
wants
to
take
into
account
only
income.
if
they
really
believe
that
income
is
the
only
predictor
of
dependency
then
why
not
make
that
the
standard
for
determining
dependency.
instead,
they
take
a
biological
class,
women,
and
they
ascribe
the
status
to
the
entire
class
without
reservation.
if
they
believe
that
lower
income
equals
dependency
then
let
them
protect
their
own
interest
by
making
that,
that
is
income
the
criterion
and
in
the
sex
discrimination
they
could
do
this
with
a
narrowly
drawn
statute.
now,
we
doubt
that
what
the
government
refers
to
in
its
brief
as,
if
i
recall
correctly,
economic
facts
of
life
are
really
facts
at
all.
their
own
statistics
is
set
out
on
page
51
of
our
own
blue
brief
show
that
armed
forces
males
actually
are
earn
less
than
females.
now,
if
lower
income
equals
dependency
then
the
majority
of
armed
forces
males
who
are
now
granted
in
irrefutable
presumption,
would
not
be
able
to
prove
their
spouses
dependent.
now,
they
say
that
our
use
of
this
kind
of
comparison
is
unfair
kind
of
like
mixing
apples
and
oranges.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
of
armed
forces
males,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
don’t
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
it
very
well
could
be.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
let’s
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
--
let's
assume
that
the
government
is
correct
in
what
they
say
that
we
should
not
have
used
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
would.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that’s
correct.
now,
let’s
say
that
the
government
is
correct
in
what
they
have
to
say
about
our
analysis
that
way.
they
suggest
that
we
should
instead
use
the
figure
for
all
women
instead
of
just
women
in
the
working
population.
well,
let’s
do
that.
now
the
census
shows
that
for
all
women
and
this
is
for
everyone
over
the
age
of
14,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
are
employed
that
for
all
women
as
a
median
income
of
$2,400.
and
if
we
lump
the
military
male’s
median
income
which
is
$3,700
with
the
median
income
for
the
female,
we
come
up
with
a
$6,100
lump
sum
median.
now,
the
dependency
standard
we
recall
is
one-half
in
fact
or
one-half
dependency.
for
a
woman
to
fail
to
provide,
that
is
the
wife
of
an
air
force
or
any
armed
services
member
for
him
--
for
her
to
fail
to
provide,
one-half
of
her
own
support,
she
would
have
to
have
expenses
that
total
$4,800
which
would
be
over
80%
of
the
entire
family’s
income.
now,
we
don’t
think
that
the
government
can
prove
or
saying
here
that
service
family's
wives
such
spendthrifts,
i
don’t
believe
this
anyway
to
prove
it.
but
this
whole
analytical
approach
of
statistics
is
extremely
misleading.
we
don’t
think
that
it
has
any
particular
relevance
in
this
case
because
the
crucial
aspect
of
it
is
the
substantive
inequality
which
results
here.
and
that
is
that
when
you
get
right
down
to
the
bottom
that
males
who
cannot
prove
their
wives
dependent,
nevertheless,
receive
the
benefits.
women
in
the
identical
position
do
not
and
there’s
no
way
to
cure
that.
there’s
no
way
to
cure
that
in
sharron
frontiero’s
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
don’t
have
access
to
these
percentages.
as
i
recall
the
figures
are
that
there
are
approximately
a
million
five
married
male
service
members
and
that
there
are
somewhere
in
excess
of,
i
am
talking
the
government
new
figures,
are
somewhere
in
excess
of
6,000
married
female
service
members,
that’s
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
they
very
well
could
be.
i
have
not
computed
this,
but
i
would
say
that
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
mr.
justice,
the
only
part
of
the
government’s
argument,
their
entire
argument
is
based
upon
administrative
convenience.
and
that
is
all
that
they
have
alleged.
to
them,
that’s
the
only
justification
and
we
don’t
say
that
this
is
an
illegitimate
end
because
of
course
it
isn’t.
but
it
in
itself
cannot
justify
the
discrimination
that
exists
here.
if
it
did
then
any
arbitrary
cut
off
in
benefits
would
be
constitutional.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson,
in
reed
versus
reed,
we
feel
that
this
court
explicitly
rejected
administrative
convenience
as
justifying
this
kind
of
discrimination.
and
the
court
in
shapiro
explicitly
stated
that
this
interest
was
insufficient
regardless
of
whether
measured
against
the
rational
basis
or
the
compelling
state
interest
standard.
now,
the
government
has
proposed
that
the
minimal
standard
of
review
be
used
here.
the
amicus,
american
civil
liberties
union
has
proposed
that
the
--
and
will
argue
that
the
strict
standard
of
suspect
classification
is
appropriate
for
this
case.
now,
we
suggest.
we,
as
appellant
suggest
that
the
strict
standard
applicable
in
the
--
that
the
strict
standard
here
does
not
pose
a
choice
between
polar
alternatives.
we
agree
wholeheartedly
with
what
mr.
justice
powell
had
to
say
in
weber
versus
aetna.
that
regardless
of
the
test
employed
here,
that
the
essential
inquiry
is
inevitably
a
deal
what
legitimate
state
interest
does
the
classification
promote
and
what
fundamental
personal
rights,
might
the
classification
endanger.
now
here,
the
classification
that
we’re
talking
about
surrounds
employment
benefits
and
this
is
an
area
of
discrimination
in
which
women
had
been
discriminated
against
--
been
the
object
of
discrimination,
i
think
and
that’s
well
documented.
the
government’s
approach
employs
sort
of
reverse
bootstraps
theory
where
their
reasoning
is
that
traditional
discrimination
and
employment
should
be
rewarded
by
further
discrimination
and
employment
benefits,
if
you
look
at
the
figures
that
they
attempt
to
use.
now,
we
got
stack
up
against
the
woman’s
right
to
be
free
from
these
inequalities
and
what
the
government
stacks
up
against
the
right
of
women
to
be
free
inequalities
is
the
ease
of
administration.
that’s
the
only
thing
that
they
really
advanced
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
it’s
a
personal
right.
it’s
a
personal
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
be
free
from
discrimination
and
employment.
and
it
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
so
too.
but
i
think
with
the
right
that
i’m
talking
about
and
i
think
that
the
kind
of
personal
right
that
court
is
talking
about
and
mr.
justice
powell
is
talking
about
for
the
court
in
weber
was
–
was
the
right
to
be
--
for
group
to
be
free
from
discrimination,
here
that’s
the
right
for
women
as
a
group
to
be
free
from
discrimination
and
that
you
got
to
look
at
the
facts
involved
in
that
case.
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
and
you
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
government
has
advanced
to
sufficient
or
legitimate
is
the
language
is
here,
governmental
interest.
for
example,
evidence
might
be
adduced
to
show
that
a
sex
difference
which
related
to
performance
in
combat
would
be
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
that
might
be.
i
am
not
saying
it
would
be
but
it
might
be
and
here,
the
air
force
certainly
doesn’t
claim
that
the
general
earning
differentials
that
you
see
in
the
population
as
a
whole
would
justify
discrimination,
sex
discrimination
in
basic
pay.
so,
it
certainly
couldn’t
justify
sex
to
discrimination
in
fringe
benefits.
we
think
that
mr.
justice
powell’s
analysis
in
webber
is
a
legitimate
method
for
determining
what
standard
to
be
used
in
this
case.
it’s
stronger
than
the
minimal
scrutiny
standard
which
the
government
proposes.
we
feel
that
a
burden
should
be
placed
on
both
the
government,
the
government
to
show
illegitimate
governmental
interest
and
on
the
appellant
to
show
that
there
is
discrimination.
we
think
that
there
should
be
equal
burdens
here.
the
test
should
be
stronger
than
it
is
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
your
honor,
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that,
that
is
fine
except
when
the
state
is
classifying
different
groups
and
especially
when
they
are
classifying
a
group
which
is
traditionally
been
the
object
of
discrimination,
and
consequently,
the
lower
standard
in
sex
discrimination
cases,
the
minimal
scrutiny
standard
simply
isn’t
sufficient.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
step
one
owe
it
before
its
test.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
legislature
should
consider
this
in
passing
legislation
and
they
should
make
sure
that
you
don’t
have
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
appellants
in
this
case
would
say
that
apparently,
the
congress
did
not
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
constitution
in
enacting
these
particular
provisions.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
petitioner
was
in
a
sense
a
volunteer.
she
--
the
air
force
put
her
through
some
portion
of
her
schooling
and
in
return
she
was
obligated
to
serve
in
the
air
force.
so
it’s
six
of
one,
half
a
dozen
of
another,
i
would
say
that
probably
a
volunteer.
i
have
used
more
time
than
i
should
have.
i’d
like
professor
ginsburg
to
speak
the
appellant’s
respective
position
of
strict
view
that
is
going
to
argue
and
felt
that
it
was
essential
in
this
case
that
she
be
given
an
opportunity
to
present
oral
argument
to
the
court.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
would
do
answer
mr.
justice
white
about
which
provision
of
the
statute
should
be
struck.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
first
of
all,
i
think
you
don’t
get
into
any
trouble
by
striking
that
portion
that
begins
however
and
in
support.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
because
i
don’t
believe
that
“his”
means
his
in
the
masculine
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
doesn’t
mean
it
now.
because
the
only
limitation
you
have
is
down
here
is
not
a
dependent
of
a
female
member
unless
he
is
in
fact
dependent
on
her
for
over
one-half
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
am
looking
at
page
23
(a)
of
the
appendix.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
last
paragraph.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
but
i
certainly
wouldn’t
construe
“his”
in
the
masculine
or
feminine
sense.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
believe
that
that
would
extend
the
benefits
to
all,
yes
sir.
i
think
the
government
has
misconstrued
the
basic
question
here
and
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
basic
purpose
of
these
statutes
in
the
legislative
history
shows
this
is
to
extend
these
benefits
to
men
and
women,
that’s
the
language
that
the
legislature
use
and
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
used.
and
the
idea
was
to
encourage
re-enlistment
of
men
and
women
and
it
said
more
than
once,
so
that
is
the
legislative
history.
anything
else,
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statutes.
i
think
we
lose
sight
of
the
issue
that
no
matter
how
many
figures
are
thrown
after
the
court
that
nevertheless
you
get
right
down
to
rock-bottom,
women
who
are
identically
situated
to
men
as
in
the
case
of
lieutenant
frontiero
don’t
receive
either
housing
benefits
or
medical
benefits
and
there
can’t
be
no
justification
for
that
kind
of
situation.
the
government
talked
in
terms
of
forms
that
have
to
be
filled
out.
well,
i
know
for
military
experience
that
there
are
hundred
forms
that
have
to
be
filled
out
when
you
go
in.
men,
all
service
people
have
to
inform
the
government
as
to
how
many
dependents
they
have
and
a
variety
of
other
items
in
order
to
determine
initially
what
kind
of
payments
they
might
be
eligible
to
receive.
so
you’re
not
asking
for
any,
if
you
extend
it
all
the
way
around,
you
certainly
wouldn’t
be
asking
for
any
extension.
you
just
have
to
require
a
quality
of
root,
i
prefer
to
call
it
that.
this
senate
bill
has
been
discussed
by
the
government,
of
course,
is
speculative
and
it's
only
perspective
as
i
read
it
would
not
apply
whatsoever
to
assist
lieutenant
frontiero
and
her
husband.
i
think
in
reed
versus
reed
that
the
lower
court
there
talked
in
terms
of
a
difference
and
the
experience
of
men
and
women
and
attempted
to
justify
the
classification
that
way.
well,
statistics
in
that
case
could
just
as
easily
have
shown
that
more
than
in
any
business
world
than
are
women
and
that
con
--
and
have
more
and
consequently,
they
have
more
experience
of
the
classification
would
then
be
justified,
once
again,
under
the
administrative
convenience
justification.
i
think
you
get
into
a
problem
when
you
try
and
ask
the
question
what
is
the
definition
of
dependency.
the
government
seems
to
want
to
use
one-half
dependent
in
the
case
of
women
who
are
seeking
to
have
their
husbands
as
dependents
but
to
use
another
classification
that
is
just
general
dependency
of
bread
winning
in
the
case
of
men,
and
we
think
that
this
cannot
in
any
way
be
justified.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
sex
discrimination
case.
after
a
short
statement
of
the
facts
here,
i
will
seek
to
refute
the
government’s
statistical
analysis
of
the
case
and
point
to
what
we
consider
to
be
then
substantiability
of
the
government’s
interest
in
continuing
this
particular
sex
discrimination.
following
this,
i
will
speak
briefly
about
the
merits
of
judging
sex
classifications
by
what
we
consider
to
be
an
intermediate
test.
professor
ginsburg
to
my
left
will
then
speak
on
the
merits
of
judging
these
cases
by
standard
of
strict
scrutiny.
a
year
after
entering
the
armed
forces
in
1968,
lieutenant
sharron
frontiero
married
joseph
frontiero.
because
of
the
statutes
which
are
at
issue
here,
any
male
member
of
the
armed
forces
would
have
automatically
become
entitled
to
certain
housing
allowance
benefits
and
medical
benefits.
lieutenant
frontiero
did
not.
the
statutes
giving
males
in
the
armed
forces
the
irrebuttable
presumption,
that
their
spouses
are
dependent,
and
grant
benefits
regardless
of
the
wives’
actual
financial
dependency.
a
female
must
prove
that
her
spouse
is
in
fact
dependent
upon
her
for
more
than
one-half
of
his
support.
in
this
case,
lieutenant
frontiero
earns
more
than
three
times
as
much
as
her
husband
joseph.
her
income
is
approximately
$8,200.
his
income
is
just
a
little
in
excess
of
$2,800.
but
because
joseph’s
individual
expenses
are
low,
his
small
income
meets
more
than
half
of
his
personal
expenses.
now,
sharron
was
therefore
denied
any
supplemental
benefits
in
both
housing
and
medical
for
her
spouse.
it’s
undisputed
that
under
these
statutes,
the
ones
which
are
at
issue
here
that
male
armed
forces
member
would
have
received
this
housing
and
medical
benefits.
so
we
have
a
two-fold
discrimination.
the
first
is
procedural.
women
are
forced
to
the
burdens
and
uncertainties
of
proving
that
their
spouses
are
in
fact
dependent
upon
them
while
males
are
given
the
benefits
automatically
and
irrefutably.
but
more
importantly,
there’s
a
substantive
discrimination
here.
males
whose
wives
are
not
financially
dependent
upon
them,
nevertheless
receive
these
housing
and
medical
benefits.
women
in
precisely
the
same
circumstances,
identical
circumstances
do
not
receive
the
benefits.
and
the
government
really
seeks
to
explain
a
way
this
discrimination
by
saying
that
it’s
only
a
procedural
difference.
and
that
since
women
earn
less
than
men
that
they
can
presume
for
the
sake,
and
i’m
talking
about
women
in
the
general
population
that
they
can
presume
for
the
sake
of
administrative
convenience
or
administrative
ease
that
the
male
spouses
are
financially
dependent.
we
have
three
relatively
simple
answers
to
the
government’s
contention
that
lower
income
shows
dependency.
first
of
all,
earning
levels
don’t
alone
necessarily
indicate
dependency
only
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
think
that
earning
level,
not
necessary
even
a
general
tendency
i
would
think
that
you
could
say
that
in
the
whole
population
that
it
does
indicate
a
tendency
that
men
earn
more
than
women,
and
we
don’t
dispute
that.
we
don’t
dispute
that
at
all.
but
the
only
reason
that
joseph
frontiero’s
expense
that
the
--
only
because
his
expenses
are
low
as
he
is
technically
not
one-half
financially
dependent
upon
his
wife,
sharron
frontiero,
which
is
the
criteria
and
the
standard
that
women
are
forced
to
submit
to
under
these
statutes.
and
this
is
--
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
income
is
less
than
one-third
of
her
income.
so,
though
we
feel
that
income
and
expenses
are
relevant
in
this
case,
the
government
wants
to
take
into
account
only
income.
if
they
really
believe
that
income
is
the
only
predictor
of
dependency
then
why
not
make
that
the
standard
for
determining
dependency.
instead,
they
take
a
biological
class,
women,
and
they
ascribe
the
status
to
the
entire
class
without
reservation.
if
they
believe
that
lower
income
equals
dependency
then
let
them
protect
their
own
interest
by
making
that,
that
is
income
the
criterion
and
in
the
sex
discrimination
they
could
do
this
with
a
narrowly
drawn
statute.
now,
we
doubt
that
what
the
government
refers
to
in
its
brief
as,
if
i
recall
correctly,
economic
facts
of
life
are
really
facts
at
all.
their
own
statistics
is
set
out
on
page
51
of
our
own
blue
brief
show
that
armed
forces
males
actually
are
earn
less
than
females.
now,
if
lower
income
equals
dependency
then
the
majority
of
armed
forces
males
who
are
now
granted
in
irrefutable
presumption,
would
not
be
able
to
prove
their
spouses
dependent.
now,
they
say
that
our
use
of
this
kind
of
comparison
is
unfair
kind
of
like
mixing
apples
and
oranges.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
of
armed
forces
males,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
don’t
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
it
very
well
could
be.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
let’s
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
--
let's
assume
that
the
government
is
correct
in
what
they
say
that
we
should
not
have
used
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
would.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that’s
correct.
now,
let’s
say
that
the
government
is
correct
in
what
they
have
to
say
about
our
analysis
that
way.
they
suggest
that
we
should
instead
use
the
figure
for
all
women
instead
of
just
women
in
the
working
population.
well,
let’s
do
that.
now
the
census
shows
that
for
all
women
and
this
is
for
everyone
over
the
age
of
14,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
are
employed
that
for
all
women
as
a
median
income
of
$2,400.
and
if
we
lump
the
military
male’s
median
income
which
is
$3,700
with
the
median
income
for
the
female,
we
come
up
with
a
$6,100
lump
sum
median.
now,
the
dependency
standard
we
recall
is
one-half
in
fact
or
one-half
dependency.
for
a
woman
to
fail
to
provide,
that
is
the
wife
of
an
air
force
or
any
armed
services
member
for
him
--
for
her
to
fail
to
provide,
one-half
of
her
own
support,
she
would
have
to
have
expenses
that
total
$4,800
which
would
be
over
80%
of
the
entire
family’s
income.
now,
we
don’t
think
that
the
government
can
prove
or
saying
here
that
service
family's
wives
such
spendthrifts,
i
don’t
believe
this
anyway
to
prove
it.
but
this
whole
analytical
approach
of
statistics
is
extremely
misleading.
we
don’t
think
that
it
has
any
particular
relevance
in
this
case
because
the
crucial
aspect
of
it
is
the
substantive
inequality
which
results
here.
and
that
is
that
when
you
get
right
down
to
the
bottom
that
males
who
cannot
prove
their
wives
dependent,
nevertheless,
receive
the
benefits.
women
in
the
identical
position
do
not
and
there’s
no
way
to
cure
that.
there’s
no
way
to
cure
that
in
sharron
frontiero’s
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
don’t
have
access
to
these
percentages.
as
i
recall
the
figures
are
that
there
are
approximately
a
million
five
married
male
service
members
and
that
there
are
somewhere
in
excess
of,
i
am
talking
the
government
new
figures,
are
somewhere
in
excess
of
6,000
married
female
service
members,
that’s
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
they
very
well
could
be.
i
have
not
computed
this,
but
i
would
say
that
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
mr.
justice,
the
only
part
of
the
government’s
argument,
their
entire
argument
is
based
upon
administrative
convenience.
and
that
is
all
that
they
have
alleged.
to
them,
that’s
the
only
justification
and
we
don’t
say
that
this
is
an
illegitimate
end
because
of
course
it
isn’t.
but
it
in
itself
cannot
justify
the
discrimination
that
exists
here.
if
it
did
then
any
arbitrary
cut
off
in
benefits
would
be
constitutional.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson,
in
reed
versus
reed,
we
feel
that
this
court
explicitly
rejected
administrative
convenience
as
justifying
this
kind
of
discrimination.
and
the
court
in
shapiro
explicitly
stated
that
this
interest
was
insufficient
regardless
of
whether
measured
against
the
rational
basis
or
the
compelling
state
interest
standard.
now,
the
government
has
proposed
that
the
minimal
standard
of
review
be
used
here.
the
amicus,
american
civil
liberties
union
has
proposed
that
the
--
and
will
argue
that
the
strict
standard
of
suspect
classification
is
appropriate
for
this
case.
now,
we
suggest.
we,
as
appellant
suggest
that
the
strict
standard
applicable
in
the
--
that
the
strict
standard
here
does
not
pose
a
choice
between
polar
alternatives.
we
agree
wholeheartedly
with
what
mr.
justice
powell
had
to
say
in
weber
versus
aetna.
that
regardless
of
the
test
employed
here,
that
the
essential
inquiry
is
inevitably
a
deal
what
legitimate
state
interest
does
the
classification
promote
and
what
fundamental
personal
rights,
might
the
classification
endanger.
now
here,
the
classification
that
we’re
talking
about
surrounds
employment
benefits
and
this
is
an
area
of
discrimination
in
which
women
had
been
discriminated
against
--
been
the
object
of
discrimination,
i
think
and
that’s
well
documented.
the
government’s
approach
employs
sort
of
reverse
bootstraps
theory
where
their
reasoning
is
that
traditional
discrimination
and
employment
should
be
rewarded
by
further
discrimination
and
employment
benefits,
if
you
look
at
the
figures
that
they
attempt
to
use.
now,
we
got
stack
up
against
the
woman’s
right
to
be
free
from
these
inequalities
and
what
the
government
stacks
up
against
the
right
of
women
to
be
free
inequalities
is
the
ease
of
administration.
that’s
the
only
thing
that
they
really
advanced
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
it’s
a
personal
right.
it’s
a
personal
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
be
free
from
discrimination
and
employment.
and
it
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
so
too.
but
i
think
with
the
right
that
i’m
talking
about
and
i
think
that
the
kind
of
personal
right
that
court
is
talking
about
and
mr.
justice
powell
is
talking
about
for
the
court
in
weber
was
–
was
the
right
to
be
--
for
group
to
be
free
from
discrimination,
here
that’s
the
right
for
women
as
a
group
to
be
free
from
discrimination
and
that
you
got
to
look
at
the
facts
involved
in
that
case.
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
and
you
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
government
has
advanced
to
sufficient
or
legitimate
is
the
language
is
here,
governmental
interest.
for
example,
evidence
might
be
adduced
to
show
that
a
sex
difference
which
related
to
performance
in
combat
would
be
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
that
might
be.
i
am
not
saying
it
would
be
but
it
might
be
and
here,
the
air
force
certainly
doesn’t
claim
that
the
general
earning
differentials
that
you
see
in
the
population
as
a
whole
would
justify
discrimination,
sex
discrimination
in
basic
pay.
so,
it
certainly
couldn’t
justify
sex
to
discrimination
in
fringe
benefits.
we
think
that
mr.
justice
powell’s
analysis
in
webber
is
a
legitimate
method
for
determining
what
standard
to
be
used
in
this
case.
it’s
stronger
than
the
minimal
scrutiny
standard
which
the
government
proposes.
we
feel
that
a
burden
should
be
placed
on
both
the
government,
the
government
to
show
illegitimate
governmental
interest
and
on
the
appellant
to
show
that
there
is
discrimination.
we
think
that
there
should
be
equal
burdens
here.
the
test
should
be
stronger
than
it
is
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
your
honor,
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that,
that
is
fine
except
when
the
state
is
classifying
different
groups
and
especially
when
they
are
classifying
a
group
which
is
traditionally
been
the
object
of
discrimination,
and
consequently,
the
lower
standard
in
sex
discrimination
cases,
the
minimal
scrutiny
standard
simply
isn’t
sufficient.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
step
one
owe
it
before
its
test.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
legislature
should
consider
this
in
passing
legislation
and
they
should
make
sure
that
you
don’t
have
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
appellants
in
this
case
would
say
that
apparently,
the
congress
did
not
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
constitution
in
enacting
these
particular
provisions.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
petitioner
was
in
a
sense
a
volunteer.
she
--
the
air
force
put
her
through
some
portion
of
her
schooling
and
in
return
she
was
obligated
to
serve
in
the
air
force.
so
it’s
six
of
one,
half
a
dozen
of
another,
i
would
say
that
probably
a
volunteer.
i
have
used
more
time
than
i
should
have.
i’d
like
professor
ginsburg
to
speak
the
appellant’s
respective
position
of
strict
view
that
is
going
to
argue
and
felt
that
it
was
essential
in
this
case
that
she
be
given
an
opportunity
to
present
oral
argument
to
the
court.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
would
do
answer
mr.
justice
white
about
which
provision
of
the
statute
should
be
struck.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
first
of
all,
i
think
you
don’t
get
into
any
trouble
by
striking
that
portion
that
begins
however
and
in
support.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
because
i
don’t
believe
that
“his”
means
his
in
the
masculine
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
doesn’t
mean
it
now.
because
the
only
limitation
you
have
is
down
here
is
not
a
dependent
of
a
female
member
unless
he
is
in
fact
dependent
on
her
for
over
one-half
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
am
looking
at
page
23
(a)
of
the
appendix.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
last
paragraph.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
but
i
certainly
wouldn’t
construe
“his”
in
the
masculine
or
feminine
sense.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
believe
that
that
would
extend
the
benefits
to
all,
yes
sir.
i
think
the
government
has
misconstrued
the
basic
question
here
and
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
basic
purpose
of
these
statutes
in
the
legislative
history
shows
this
is
to
extend
these
benefits
to
men
and
women,
that’s
the
language
that
the
legislature
use
and
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
used.
and
the
idea
was
to
encourage
re-enlistment
of
men
and
women
and
it
said
more
than
once,
so
that
is
the
legislative
history.
anything
else,
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statutes.
i
think
we
lose
sight
of
the
issue
that
no
matter
how
many
figures
are
thrown
after
the
court
that
nevertheless
you
get
right
down
to
rock-bottom,
women
who
are
identically
situated
to
men
as
in
the
case
of
lieutenant
frontiero
don’t
receive
either
housing
benefits
or
medical
benefits
and
there
can’t
be
no
justification
for
that
kind
of
situation.
the
government
talked
in
terms
of
forms
that
have
to
be
filled
out.
well,
i
know
for
military
experience
that
there
are
hundred
forms
that
have
to
be
filled
out
when
you
go
in.
men,
all
service
people
have
to
inform
the
government
as
to
how
many
dependents
they
have
and
a
variety
of
other
items
in
order
to
determine
initially
what
kind
of
payments
they
might
be
eligible
to
receive.
so
you’re
not
asking
for
any,
if
you
extend
it
all
the
way
around,
you
certainly
wouldn’t
be
asking
for
any
extension.
you
just
have
to
require
a
quality
of
root,
i
prefer
to
call
it
that.
this
senate
bill
has
been
discussed
by
the
government,
of
course,
is
speculative
and
it's
only
perspective
as
i
read
it
would
not
apply
whatsoever
to
assist
lieutenant
frontiero
and
her
husband.
i
think
in
reed
versus
reed
that
the
lower
court
there
talked
in
terms
of
a
difference
and
the
experience
of
men
and
women
and
attempted
to
justify
the
classification
that
way.
well,
statistics
in
that
case
could
just
as
easily
have
shown
that
more
than
in
any
business
world
than
are
women
and
that
con
--
and
have
more
and
consequently,
they
have
more
experience
of
the
classification
would
then
be
justified,
once
again,
under
the
administrative
convenience
justification.
i
think
you
get
into
a
problem
when
you
try
and
ask
the
question
what
is
the
definition
of
dependency.
the
government
seems
to
want
to
use
one-half
dependent
in
the
case
of
women
who
are
seeking
to
have
their
husbands
as
dependents
but
to
use
another
classification
that
is
just
general
dependency
of
bread
winning
in
the
case
of
men,
and
we
think
that
this
cannot
in
any
way
be
justified.
