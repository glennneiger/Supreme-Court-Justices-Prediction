chief

e.

mr.
porter,
do
you
regard
this
case
as
essentially
a
licensing
case
or
an
obscenity
case
per
se?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
that
was
the
purport
of
my
question
to
you
whether
this
is
a
licensing
cases
or
an
obscenity
case.
it's
a
licensing
case
relating
to
the
sale
of
liquor
as
justice
stewart
emphasizes
and
what
else
is
--
what
other
businesses
transacted
in
conjunction
with
that
is
the
matter
for
the
state
police
power
of
california
at
least,
so
i
would
understand
the
state's
position.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
under
the
same
power
that
the
state
might
exercise
if
it
prohibited
sale
of
intoxicating
beverages
within
500
yards
of
a
school.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
the
basically
the
same
premise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
hertzberg?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
across
the
street
from
the
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
kind
of
a
police
power
they
are
exercising
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
an
environmental
decision
in
each
case,
is
it
not
on
part
of
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about,
to
go
back
this
limitation
that
justice
stewart
is
pressing
at,
could
they
validly
prohibit
the
sale
of
gasoline
and
liquor
in
the
same
establishment,
in
other
words
selling
liquor
at
a
filling
station?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
hertzberg.
mr.
scholtz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
reject
the
position
of
the
state
that
this
is
a
licensing
case
rather
than
first
amendment
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
schultz.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
porter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you
gentlemen.
