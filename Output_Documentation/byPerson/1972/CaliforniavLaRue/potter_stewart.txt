justice
potter
stewart
how
does
this
litigation
arise,
is
it
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
licenses
were
the
plaintiffs
though?
justice
potter
stewart
asking
for
the
declaratory
judgment
that
these
regulations
are
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
enjoin
their
enforcement?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
been
any
license
revocation
proceedings
against
any
of
these
plaintiffs?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wondered
if
there
were
younger
problem
in
this
case,
younger
against
harris,
are
you
familiar
with
that
case
and
it's
companions?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
has
been
held
at
the
twenty-first
amendment
--
has
overrode
a
great
deal
of
the
commerce
clause.
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
does
by
its
terms?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
has
been
held
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
overrode
a
good
deal
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
isn’t
it,
as
was
in
the
young's
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
murder
might
not
be
a
speech
i
suppose
we
could
agree
that
it
isn't
and
yet
the
depiction
of
a
murder
in
a
movie
or
a
play,
simulated,
certainly
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
i
will
take
off
fellow
or
take
accomplished
works,
dramas
through
the
ages,
those
are
certainly
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
mr.
porter
that
and
i
have
this
feeling
reading
through
the
briefs
that
this
case
turns
around
--
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
has
not
prohibited
these
things
going
on
in
the
state
of
california
or
anywhere.
it
simply
prohibited
the
sell
of
liquor
by
the
drink
and
that's
its
function,
that's
its
jurisdiction,
and
i
should
think
that
you
could
validly
argue
whether
you
could
make
the
argument,
that
under
the
very
broad
autonomous
police
power
given
to
the
states
under
twenty-first
amendment
and
historically
that
california
could
prohibit
selling
liquor
by
the
drink
in
bookstore
if
it
wanted
to
or
within
a
100
feet
of
a
church
if
it
wanted
to,
without
violating
either
freedom
of
free
press
or
freedom
of
religion.
you
are
dealing
with
liquor
by
the
drink,
you
are
not
prohibiting
these
things
from
going
on,
you
are
prohibiting
liquor
from
being
sold,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
say
that
anywhere
in
your
brief
very
clearly?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
they
prescribed
the
sale
of
liquor
on
certain
premises,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
liquor
by
the
drink
shall
not
be
sold
in
certain
places?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you
in
tour
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell's
question,
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
a
state
could
validly
say
that
no
liquor
by
the
drink
should
be
sold
in
bookstores?
justice
potter
stewart
could
the
state
say
that
liquor
in
our
state
is
only
going
to
be
sold
where
only
liquor
is
sold
and
nothing
else
goes
on,
no
other
commodities
are
sold?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
i
am
asking
these
questions
just
to
test
your
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
them
in
many
counties
and
many
states
because
you
don't
have
any
bars
and
there
is
no
question
about
the
power
of
a
state
in
its
entirety
or
in
some
of
these
counties
to
not
have
any
bars
whatsoever?
justice
potter
stewart
again,
perhaps
according
to
how
you
put
it,
but
i
thought
this
had
to
do
with
places
where
liquor
could
be
sold,
not
to
what
conduct
goes
on
inside
of
a
building,
but
whether
or
not
a
liquor
could
be
sold.
in
other
words
it
is
similar
to
a
state
saying
no
liquor
shall
be
sold
while
they
drink
in
a
church.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
is
would
that
violate
the
person's
freedom
of
religion?
justice
potter
stewart
no
i
am
talking
about
the
state
had
that
kind
of
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
depends
upon
how
you
put
it,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
particular
state
agency
has
to
do
deal
with
the
regulating
the
sale
of
liquor?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
it
is
purported
to
regulate,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
places
where
liquor
can
be
sold?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
has
to
be
the
fourteenth
(inaudible)
in
the
state
of
california?
justice
potter
stewart
sheton
against
tucker.
justice
potter
stewart
mr
schultz
early
in
the
argument
of
your
brother
on
the
other
side
i
asked
about
younger
problem.
i
am
interested
now
in
another
preliminary
question
of
this
case,
i
have
read
judge
ferguson's
opinion
when
i
got
here
and
i
just
glanced
it
over
again.
now
i
have
a
hard
time
in
finding
in
his
opinion
any
conclusion
that
the
remedy
at
law
was
inadequate
or
that
there
was
a
irreparable
harm
of
course
would
be
satisfactory
conditions
to
the
issuance
of
this
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
finding
however
unless
you
can
find
it
in
this
discussion
of
blount
against
rizzi
and
freedman
against
maryland
i
suppose
the
application
--
or
otherwise
this
was
impermissible,
wasn't
it,
an
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
this
litigation
arise,
is
it
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
