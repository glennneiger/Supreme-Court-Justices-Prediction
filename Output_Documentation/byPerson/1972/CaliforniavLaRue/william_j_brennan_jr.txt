justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
said
the
state
courts
refused
to
what
render
either
a
declaratory
injunction
or
a
declaratory
judgment
or
injunction
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
refuse,
you
mean
dismissed
the
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
discretion
was
exercised
against
entertaining
the
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
appeal,
that
was
sustained,
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
take
it
as
the
case
is
here
so
far
as
the
action
of
three-judge,
federal
three-judge
court
is
concerned,
there
is
no
pending
state
proceeding
and
can
be
none
because
the
state
courts
have
refused
entertainment,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
mr.
porter,
that
one
your
part
at
least,
there
is
alternative
argument,
isn't
it?
your
basic
argument
is
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
involved
here
at
all?
