mr.
l.
stephen
porter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
regulations
of
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
which
provide
that
a
california
state
on
sale
alcoholic
beverage
license
may
not
be
held
on
premises
for
the
sale
and
consumption
of
alcohol
where
certain
sexually
oriented
acts,
conducts
or
visual
displays
are
employed
on
the
premises.
the
regulations
were
enacted
after
legislative
hearings
before
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control.
now
it
was
developed
that
these
hearings,
first
that
alcoholic
access
would
be
present
upon
the
control
centers
of
the
brain
which
normally
inhibit
the
so-called
base
behaviors
and
that
persons
consuming
alcohol
may
and
do
engage
in
acts
and
conduct
which
they
would
not
engage
in,
if
not
drinking.
secondly,
it
was
developed
that
persons
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
are
more
likely
to
be
sexually
stimulated
by
viewing
sexual
material,
sexual
conduct
and
acts
and
that
they
are
more
likely
to
engage
in
sexual
activity
or
conduct
on
premises
which
afford
or
offer
such
sexually
oriented
entertainment.
thirdly
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
by
certain
licensees,
attack
both
in
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
in
california
the
regulations
on
the
basis
that
they
were
invalid
is
infringing
upon
the
first
amendment
rights
that
the
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
licensees
and
certain
employees,
dancers
and
some
of
the
licensees
were
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
invalid
and
to
enjoin.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
the
regulations
become
effective
in
number
of
days
after
their
promulgation
and
enactment
and
placement
in
the
california
in
the
administrative
code.
before
their
effective
date,
these
actions
were
brought,
both
in
the
state
courts
and
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
federal
district
court
in
los
angeles
withheld
the
action
pending
action
by
the
state
courts.
the
california
state
courts
refused
to
hear
the
cases,
refused
to
enjoin
the
regulation.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
not
completely,
there
was
no
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes,
the
action
for
declaratory
relief
and
injunction
was
brought
in
the
state
courts.
state
courts
refused,
the
plaintiffs
went
through
the
california
court
of
appeals.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
these
were
on
petitions.
regulations
and/or
decisions
of
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
are
reviewable
either
by
petitions
for
writ
to
review
in
the
california
appellate
courts
or
under
a
type
of
hybrid
writ
of
mandate
proceeding,
which
would
be
similar
to
declaratory
relief
to
check
the
validity
of
the
regulations,
but
it
is
discretionary
with
the
california
appellate
courts
whether
or
not
they
entertain.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
against
entertaining
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
the
plaintiffs
then
went
to
california
supreme
court
and
our
office
requested
that
the
state
supreme
court
take
the
case
and
take
the
challenge
and
decide
it.
the
state
supreme
court
refused,
denied
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
only
one
perhaps
in
all
honesty.
just
prior
to
these
regulations
being
enacted,
there
was
a
case
in
the
california
courts,
boreta
enterprises
versus
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control,
case
decide
by
the
california
supreme
court.
that
case
which
came
up
before
these
regulations,
involved
the
employment
topless
waitresses
in
a
san
fransisco
bar.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that
is
correct,
they
were
disturbed
according
to
their
decision
by
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence,
there
were
no
regulations,
just
a
sterile
stipulation
that
topless
waitresses
were
employed.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that
perhaps
they
just
had
a
case
where
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record,
no
regulations
involved
and
they
did
not
want
to
take
on
a
subsequent
case
in
the
absence
of
what
they
might
thought
was
an
absence
of
the
evidentiary
record.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
possible,
i
would
not
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
i
will
not
draw
that
inference.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
licensing.
as
indicated,
the
hearing,
the
legislative
hearing
before
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
developed
the
effective
alcohol
upon
persons
imbibing
in
it
and
also
developed
through
the
testimony
of
various
law
enforcement
officials
in
california
through
department
of
investigators
that
the
sex
--
this
type
of
sexually
oriented
entertainment
is
provided
on
premises
where
alcoholic
beverages
were
sold
and
consumed
on
the
premises,
that
the
resultant
problems
on
such
premises,
including
overt
sexual
act
between
the
employees
and
the
entertainers
and
the
customers,
b
girl
activity,
as
indicated
by
officials
from
san
francisco
police
department,
where
in
1964
they
had
almost
come
to
nil
on
b
girl
activity,
the
introduction
of
the
sexually
oriented
entertainment
in
on
sale
bars
in
san
francisco
and
college
b
girl
activity
to
reach
almost
epidemic
proportions.
prostitution
increased
around
such
premises
where
you
have
this
mixture,
the
prostitutes
congregating
where
you
have
this
sexually
oriented
entertainment,
sexually
stimulating
entertainment
plus
the
customers
imbibing
in
alcoholic
beverages.
narcotic
and
drug
problems
increased
at
or
near
such
premises,
violent
crimes,
exploitation
of
customers,
overt
sex
crimes,
(inaudible)
and
temperance,
serious
and
extensive
law
enforcement
problems,
we
have
set
out
in
the
briefs.
accordingly
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
adopted
these
regulations
in
order
to
try
and
prevent
these
serious
problems
and
offenses
that
were
occurring
on
the
licensed
alcoholic
beverage
premises
in
california.
as
indicated,
the
regulations
were
tacked
by
various
licensees
in
los
angeles
and
southern
california
area,
both
in
state
and
federal
courts,
and
when
the
state
courts
refused
to
entertain
these
cases
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
in
los
angeles
heard
the
case.
on
a
two
to
one
decision,
the
lower
court
held,
relying
on
roth
and
other
obscenity
cases,
decisions
by
this
court.
the
lower
court
held
that
the
sexual
acts
and
conducts
and
this
visual
displays
that
were
prescribed
by
the
department
regulations
were
protected
expression
under
the
first
amendment
and
that
the
state
could
regulate
them
only
on
the
grounds
of
obscenity.
that
in
is
much
as
the
department
regulations
did
not
deal
with
obscenity,
they
did
not
require
standards
of
proof
as
to
obscenity,
the
regulation
must
fall.
in
addition,
we
would
note
that
its
clear,
if
one
reads
a
lower
court's
decision,
that
they
took
the
position
that
regardless
of
the
alleged
purpose
of
the
department
in
enacting
regulations
that
they
assumed
and
determined
that
the
department's
motive
was
to
circumvent
the
obscenity
laws
and
not
to
try
and
prevent
the
problems
which
the
legislative
record
had
shown.
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
argument
is
three-fold.
first
that
the
sexual
activities
and
sexual
conduct
regulated
by
these
regulations
are
not
and
do
not
constitute
symbolic
speech.
they
are
not
and
do
not
constitute
expression
and
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
secondly
that
even
if
this
court
should
determine
that
they
are
within
the
first
amendment,
that
a
state
may
regulate
the
first
amendment
activity
on
grounds
or
interest
other
than
obscenity;
that
obscenity
is
not
the
sole
touchstone
the
state
is
required
to
use
in
attempts
to
regulate
first
amendment
activity.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
based
to
the
extent
that
if
we
are
in
our
first
amendment
area,
then
as
far
as
balancing
the
state’s
interest,
we
submit
that
both
the
traditional
power
that
a
state
has
had
over
the
conditions
surrounding
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
and
the
power
given
to
the
states
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
must
be
considered
in
balancing
the
state
interest
that
these
are
substantial
and
important
state
interests,
where
we
are
talking
about
the
condition
surrounding
the
sale
and
consumption
of
alcoholic
beverages.
we
have
never
argued,
nor
would
we
ever
argue
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
automatically
override
the
first
amendment
or
any
other
part
of
the
constitution.
we
only
urge
that
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
well
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
correct,
but
i
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes,
but
i
would
submit
that
i
would
myself
attempt
to
temper
that
somewhat
to
the
extent.
i
think
it
shows
an
overriding
state
interest
in
weighing
between
the
commerce
clause
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
where
you
get
up
an
equal
protection,
you
get
up
and
so
the
first
amendment
or
some
so
called
alleged
preferred
clauses
or
amendments
of
the
constitution;
as
i
say,
we
do
not
argue
that
it
overrides
the
first
amendment,
but
if
we
are
dealing
in
a
first
amendment
area
that
a
great
weight
should
be
given
to
state’s
interest
and
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
balancing
and
weighing
whether
the
state
interests
outweigh
the
interest
to
be
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
correct.
and
thirdly,
we
argue
that
a
federal
court
may
not
enjoin
or
invalidate
otherwise
valid
regulations
on
the
grounds
that
it
believes
a
bad
motive
influenced
the
regulations.
now,
first
of
all
is
to,
this
not
being
first
amendment
activities,
we
submit
that
public
and
commercial
acts
such
as
masturbation
or
copulation,
sodomy,
exposure
of
the
genitals
do
not
constitute
symbolic
speech
or
expression
and
that
such
acts
and
conduct
do
not
contain
a
recognizable
significant
speech
element
entitling
them
to
first
amendment
protection.
and
assuming
that
dancing
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
which
is
the
main
argument
of
the
licensees
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
licensees
may
not
make
sexual
acts
and
conduct
and
visual
displays
dancing
by
merely
calling
it
dancing
or
the
fact
that
such
acts
or
conducts
that
are
engaged
in
with
music
being
played
or
that
they
may
do
some
dance
steps
up
to
the
act
or
dance
away
from
the
act
does
not
make
these
acts,
the
sexual
acts,
sexual
conduct,
dancing.
sexual
conduct
and
acts
are
sexual
conducts
and
acts.
furthermore,
we
would
submit
that
if
the
live
sexual
acts
or
conduct
or
displays
are
not
speech,
it
does
not
seem
rationale
to
us
to
say
that
by
merely
putting
such
acts
or
even
conduct
on
film
that
they
are
transformed
into
speech,
the
minute
they
are
put
on
the
film
and
visually
displayed
by
film
rather
than
live.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes,
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
regulations
that
do
not
want
the
sexually
oriented
entertainment,
whether
it'd
be
on
film
or
whether
it'd
be
live
and
we're
not
looking
at
--
to
the
context.
i
suppose
a
--
if
one
just
showed
a
murder
and
nothing
more
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
alright
and
as
to
that,
we'd
say
that,
if
it
is
within
the
first
amendment,
that
the
state
here
could
show
a
proper
more
significant
interest
to
more
out
weighing
interest
in
preventing
the
display
of
such
films
on
premises
where
alcoholic
beverages
are
being
consumed,
conceding
that
it
would
be
first
amendment
film,
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
believe
the
state
can
properly
restrict
such
films
from
premises
where
alcoholic
beverages
are
being
sold
and
consumed.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
well
it
would
have
encroach
in
the
sense
that
and
that
is
the
interest
of
the
state
involved
here
over
the
control
of
conditions
surrounding
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages.
so
the
21st
would
be
in
the
state's
traditional
power,
absent
twenty-first
over
the
conditions
surrounding
the
sale
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
i
submit,
if
the
legislative
--
no
regulations
do
not.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
regulations
do
not
prohibit
books.
if
the
legislative
hearing
before
the
department
show
that
books
were
sold
on
such
premises
and
that
where
you
ask
sexually
oriented
books,
combined
with
persons
drinking
alcohol
that
you
have
these
bad
results
occurring
than
i
assume
that
it
would
promulgate
as
part
of
the
regulations
or
prohibition
against
such
sexually
oriented
books
being
sold
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
no,
i
submit
that
it
would
be
under
the
state's
traditional
broad
police
powers
over
alcoholic
beverages.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
do
i
assume
that
there
are
books
that
cannot
be
prohibited
from
sale?
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
if
there
was
a
proper
basis
for
it,
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
well,
i
wonder
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
o'brien,
i
suppose
if
it
was
shown
than
whenever
a
certain
book
or
certain
types
of
books
were
present
on
a
bar
that
resulted
in,
always
in
breaches
of
the
peace.
there
is
a
book
on
protest
to
war
and
that
when
people
were
drinking
in
bars,
that
the
record
show
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
when
you
had
this
book
in
a
bar
and
people
were
drinking,
you
automatically
had
a--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
oh,
i
would
endorse
it.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
well
aside
from
that
position
that
the
state
is
merely
licensing
liquor
by
the
drink
and
just
saying
where
it
maybe
sold,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
nonetheless
assuming
that
it
should
be
found
that
the
conduct,
the
acts,
the
displays
that
are
prohibited
by
this
regulations
from
being
a
performed
or
being
offered
on
on-sale
alcoholic
beverage
premises
are
within
the
first
amendment.
and
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
state
that
the
state
is
actually
trying
to
regulate
first
amendment
activity
and
not
trying
to
do
something
in
furtherance
of
alcoholic
beverage
control.
we
submit
that
a
state
may
regulate
on
grounds
other
than
obscenity
that
the
decisions
relied
on
by
the
lower
court,
roth
and
the
obscenity
cases,
and
relied
on
by
the
licenses,
deal
solely
where
a
state
is
proceeding
against
acts
or
conduct
on
the
basis
that
they
are
obscene
and
as
we
have
indicated
that
is
not
the
state's
interest
here.
this
court
set
down
the
criteria
in
united
states
versus
o'brien.
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs,
how
we
feel
that
has
been
made
by
the
state's
regulations.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
we
submit
that
they
are
not
overbroad
and
vague.
they
prescribe
specific
sexual
acts,
specific
sexual
conduct
and
limited
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
in
their
form,
the
regulation
state
that
a
on-sale
license
shall
not
be
held
on
premises
which
offer
the
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
certain
places
that
offer
these
specific
acts
and
conduct.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
and
in
that
respect,
a
specific
--
they
are
not
overbroad
in
that
the
regulations
do
not
prescribe
the
holding
of
a
license
on
premises
that
offer
any
entertainment
or
as
they
do
not
prescribe
that
such
entertainment
may
not
be
offered
in
any
premises
in
california,
it's
limited
to
on-sale
alcoholic
beverages
where
the
customer's
are
breaking.
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
no.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
regulations
of
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
which
provide
that
a
california
state
on
sale
alcoholic
beverage
license
may
not
be
held
on
premises
for
the
sale
and
consumption
of
alcohol
where
certain
sexually
oriented
acts,
conducts
or
visual
displays
are
employed
on
the
premises.
the
regulations
were
enacted
after
legislative
hearings
before
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control.
now
it
was
developed
that
these
hearings,
first
that
alcoholic
access
would
be
present
upon
the
control
centers
of
the
brain
which
normally
inhibit
the
so-called
base
behaviors
and
that
persons
consuming
alcohol
may
and
do
engage
in
acts
and
conduct
which
they
would
not
engage
in,
if
not
drinking.
secondly,
it
was
developed
that
persons
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
are
more
likely
to
be
sexually
stimulated
by

thirdly
--
mr.
l.
stephen

by
certain
licensees,
attack
both
in
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
in
california
the
regulations
on
the
basis
that
they
were
invalid
is
infringing
upon
the
first
amendment
rights
that
the

mr.

licensees
and
certain
employees,
dancers
and
some
of
the
licensees
were
the
plaintiffs.
mr.

stephen

invalid
and
to
enjoin.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
the
regulations
become
effective
in
number
of
days
after
their
promulgation
and
enactment
and
placement
in
the
california
in
the
administrative
code.
before
their
effective
date,
these
actions
were
brought,
both
in
the
state
courts
and
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
federal
district
court
in
los
angeles
withheld
the
action
pending
action
by
the
state
courts.
the
california
state
courts
refused
to
hear
the
cases,
refused
to
enjoin
the
regulation.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
not
completely,
there
was
no
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes,
the
action
for
declaratory
relief
and
injunction
was
brought
in
the
state
courts.
state
courts
refused,
the
plaintiffs
went
through
the
california
court
of
appeals.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
these
were
on
petitions.
regulations
and/or
decisions
of
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
are
reviewable
either
by
petitions
for
writ
to
review
in
the
california
appellate
courts
or
under
a
type
of
hybrid
writ
of
mandate
proceeding,
which
would
be
similar
to
declaratory
relief
to
check
the
validity
of
the
regulations,
but
it
is
discretionary
with
the
california
appellate
courts
whether
or
not
they
entertain.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
against
entertaining
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
the
plaintiffs
then
went
to
california
supreme
court
and
our
office
requested
that
the
state
supreme
court
take
the
case
and
take
the
challenge
and
decide
it.
the
state
supreme
court
refused,
denied
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
only
one
perhaps
in
all
honesty.
just
prior
to
these
regulations
being
enacted,
there
was
a
case
in
the
california
courts,
boreta
enterprises
versus
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control,
case
decide
by
the
california
supreme
court.
that
case
which
came
up
before
these
regulations,
involved
the
employment
topless
waitresses
in
a
san
fransisco
bar.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that
is
correct,
they
were
disturbed
according
to
their
decision
by
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence,
there
were
no
regulations,
just
a
sterile
stipulation
that
topless
waitresses
were
employed.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that
perhaps
they
just
had
a
case
where
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record,
no
regulations
involved
and
they
did
not
want
to
take
on
a
subsequent
case
in
the
absence
of
what
they
might
thought
was
an
absence
of
the
evidentiary
record.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
possible,
i
would
not
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
i
will
not
draw
that
inference.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
licensing.
as
indicated,
the
hearing,
the
legislative
hearing
before
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
developed
the
effective
alcohol
upon
persons
imbibing
in
it
and
also
developed
through
the
testimony
of
various
law
enforcement
officials
in
california
through
department
of
investigators
that
the
sex
--
this
type
of
sexually
oriented
entertainment
is
provided
on
premises
where
alcoholic
beverages
were
sold
and
consumed
on
the
premises,
that
the
resultant
problems
on
such
premises,
including
overt
sexual
act
between
the
employees
and
the
entertainers
and
the
customers,
b
girl
activity,
as
indicated
by
officials
from
san
francisco
police
department,
where
in
1964
they
had
almost
come
to
nil
on
b
girl
activity,
the
introduction
of
the
sexually
oriented
entertainment
in
on
sale
bars
in
san
francisco
and
college
b
girl
activity
to
reach
almost
epidemic
proportions.
prostitution
increased
around
such
premises
where
you
have
this
mixture,
the
prostitutes
congregating
where
you
have
this
sexually
oriented
entertainment,
sexually
stimulating
entertainment
plus
the
customers
imbibing
in
alcoholic
beverages.
narcotic
and
drug
problems
increased
at
or
near
such
premises,
violent
crimes,
exploitation
of
customers,
overt
sex
crimes,
(inaudible)
and
temperance,
serious
and
extensive
law
enforcement
problems,
we
have
set
out
in
the
briefs.
accordingly
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
adopted
these
regulations
in
order
to
try
and
prevent
these
serious
problems
and
offenses
that
were
occurring
on
the
licensed
alcoholic
beverage
premises
in
california.
as
indicated,
the
regulations
were
tacked
by
various
licensees
in
los
angeles
and
southern
california
area,
both
in
state
and
federal
courts,
and
when
the
state
courts
refused
to
entertain
these
cases
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
in
los
angeles
heard
the
case.
on
a
two
to
one
decision,
the
lower
court
held,
relying
on
roth
and
other
obscenity
cases,
decisions
by
this
court.
the
lower
court
held
that
the
sexual
acts
and
conducts
and
this
visual
displays
that
were
prescribed
by
the
department
regulations
were
protected
expression
under
the
first
amendment
and
that
the
state
could
regulate
them
only
on
the
grounds
of
obscenity.
that
in
is
much
as
the
department
regulations
did
not
deal
with
obscenity,
they
did
not
require
standards
of
proof
as
to
obscenity,
the
regulation
must
fall.
in
addition,
we
would
note
that
its
clear,
if
one
reads
a
lower
court's
decision,
that
they
took
the
position
that
regardless
of
the
alleged
purpose
of
the
department
in
enacting
regulations
that
they
assumed
and
determined
that
the
department's
motive
was
to
circumvent
the
obscenity
laws
and
not
to
try
and
prevent
the
problems
which
the
legislative
record
had
shown.
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
argument
is
three-fold.
first
that
the
sexual
activities
and
sexual
conduct
regulated
by
these
regulations
are
not
and
do
not
constitute
symbolic
speech.
they
are
not
and
do
not
constitute
expression
and
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
secondly
that
even
if
this
court
should
determine
that
they
are
within
the
first
amendment,
that
a
state
may
regulate
the
first
amendment
activity
on
grounds
or
interest
other
than
obscenity;
that
obscenity
is
not
the
sole
touchstone
the
state
is
required
to
use
in
attempts
to
regulate
first
amendment
activity.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
based
to
the
extent
that
if
we
are
in
our
first
amendment
area,
then
as
far
as
balancing
the
state’s
interest,
we
submit
that
both
the
traditional
power
that
a
state
has
had
over
the
conditions
surrounding
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
and
the
power
given
to
the
states
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
must
be
considered
in
balancing
the
state
interest
that
these
are
substantial
and
important
state
interests,
where
we
are
talking
about
the
condition
surrounding
the
sale
and
consumption
of
alcoholic
beverages.
we
have
never
argued,
nor
would
we
ever
argue
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
automatically
override
the
first
amendment
or
any
other
part
of
the
constitution.
we
only
urge
that
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
well
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
correct,
but
i
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes,
but
i
would
submit
that
i
would
myself
attempt
to
temper
that
somewhat
to
the
extent.
i
think
it
shows
an
overriding
state
interest
in
weighing
between
the
commerce
clause
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
where
you
get
up
an
equal
protection,
you
get
up
and
so
the
first
amendment
or
some
so
called
alleged
preferred
clauses
or
amendments
of
the
constitution;
as
i
say,
we
do
not
argue
that
it
overrides
the
first
amendment,
but
if
we
are
dealing
in
a
first
amendment
area
that
a
great
weight
should
be
given
to
state’s
interest
and
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
balancing
and
weighing
whether
the
state
interests
outweigh
the
interest
to
be
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
that's
correct.
and
thirdly,
we
argue
that
a
federal
court
may
not
enjoin
or
invalidate
otherwise
valid
regulations
on
the
grounds
that
it
believes
a
bad
motive
influenced
the
regulations.
now,
first
of
all
is
to,
this
not
being
first
amendment
activities,
we
submit
that
public
and
commercial
acts
such
as
masturbation
or
copulation,
sodomy,
exposure
of
the
genitals
do
not
constitute
symbolic
speech
or
expression
and
that
such
acts
and
conduct
do
not
contain
a
recognizable
significant
speech
element
entitling
them
to
first
amendment
protection.
and
assuming
that
dancing
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
which
is
the
main
argument
of
the
licensees
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
licensees
may
not
make
sexual
acts
and
conduct
and
visual
displays
dancing
by
merely
calling
it
dancing
or
the
fact
that
such
acts
or
conducts
that
are
engaged
in
with
music
being
played
or
that
they
may
do
some
dance
steps
up
to
the
act
or
dance
away
from
the
act
does
not
make
these
acts,
the
sexual
acts,
sexual
conduct,
dancing.
sexual
conduct
and
acts
are
sexual
conducts
and
acts.
furthermore,
we
would
submit
that
if
the
live
sexual
acts
or
conduct
or
displays
are
not
speech,
it
does
not
seem
rationale
to
us
to
say
that
by
merely
putting
such
acts
or
even
conduct
on
film
that
they
are
transformed
into
speech,
the
minute
they
are
put
on
the
film
and
visually
displayed
by
film
rather
than
live.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes,
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
regulations
that
do
not
want
the
sexually
oriented
entertainment,
whether
it'd
be
on
film
or
whether
it'd
be
live
and
we're
not
looking
at
--
to
the
context.
i
suppose
a
--
if
one
just
showed
a
murder
and
nothing
more
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
alright
and
as
to
that,
we'd
say
that,
if
it
is
within
the
first
amendment,
that
the
state
here
could
show
a
proper
more
significant
interest
to
more
out
weighing
interest
in
preventing
the
display
of
such
films
on
premises
where
alcoholic
beverages
are
being
consumed,
conceding
that
it
would
be
first
amendment
film,
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
believe
the
state
can
properly
restrict
such
films
from
premises
where
alcoholic
beverages
are
being
sold
and
consumed.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
well
it
would
have
encroach
in
the
sense
that
and
that
is
the
interest
of
the
state
involved
here
over
the
control
of
conditions
surrounding
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages.
so
the
21st
would
be
in
the
state's
traditional
power,
absent
twenty-first
over
the
conditions
surrounding
the
sale
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
i
submit,
if
the
legislative
--
no
regulations
do
not.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
regulations
do
not
prohibit
books.
if
the
legislative
hearing
before
the
department
show
that
books
were
sold
on
such
premises
and
that
where
you
ask
sexually
oriented
books,
combined
with
persons
drinking
alcohol
that
you
have
these
bad
results
occurring
than
i
assume
that
it
would
promulgate
as
part
of
the
regulations
or
prohibition
against
such
sexually
oriented
books
being
sold
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
no,
i
submit
that
it
would
be
under
the
state's
traditional
broad
police
powers
over
alcoholic
beverages.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
do
i
assume
that
there
are
books
that
cannot
be
prohibited
from
sale?
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
if
there
was
a
proper
basis
for
it,
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
well,
i
wonder
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
o'brien,
i
suppose
if
it
was
shown
than
whenever
a
certain
book
or
certain
types
of
books
were
present
on
a
bar
that
resulted
in,
always
in
breaches
of
the
peace.
there
is
a
book
on
protest
to
war
and
that
when
people
were
drinking
in
bars,
that
the
record
show
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
when
you
had
this
book
in
a
bar
and
people
were
drinking,
you
automatically
had
a--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
oh,
i
would
endorse
it.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
well
aside
from
that
position
that
the
state
is
merely
licensing
liquor
by
the
drink
and
just
saying
where
it
maybe
sold,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
nonetheless
assuming
that
it
should
be
found
that
the
conduct,
the
acts,
the
displays
that
are
prohibited
by
this
regulations
from
being
a
performed
or
being
offered
on
on-sale
alcoholic
beverage
premises
are
within
the
first
amendment.
and
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
state
that
the
state
is
actually
trying
to
regulate
first
amendment
activity
and
not
trying
to
do
something
in
furtherance
of
alcoholic
beverage
control.
we
submit
that
a
state
may
regulate
on
grounds
other
than
obscenity
that
the
decisions
relied
on
by
the
lower
court,
roth
and
the
obscenity
cases,
and
relied
on
by
the
licenses,
deal
solely
where
a
state
is
proceeding
against
acts
or
conduct
on
the
basis
that
they
are
obscene
and
as
we
have
indicated
that
is
not
the
state's
interest
here.
this
court
set
down
the
criteria
in
united
states
versus
o'brien.
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs,
how
we
feel
that
has
been
made
by
the
state's
regulations.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
we
submit
that
they
are
not
overbroad
and
vague.
they
prescribe
specific
sexual
acts,
specific
sexual
conduct
and
limited
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
in
their
form,
the
regulation
state
that
a
on-sale
license
shall
not
be
held
on
premises
which
offer
the
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
certain
places
that
offer
these
specific
acts
and
conduct.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
yes.
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
and
in
that
respect,
a
specific
--
they
are
not
overbroad
in
that
the
regulations
do
not
prescribe
the
holding
of
a
license
on
premises
that
offer
any
entertainment
or
as
they
do
not
prescribe
that
such
entertainment
may
not
be
offered
in
any
premises
in
california,
it's
limited
to
on-sale
alcoholic
beverages
where
the
customer's
are
breaking.
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
--
mr.
l.
stephen
porter
no.
