mr.
kenneth
scholtz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
please
the
court.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
this
case
involves
a
conflict
between
the
state's
police
power
to
control
alcohol
and
the
first
amendment.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
these
rules
would
be
over-broad,
over-broad
and
vague
under
the
first
amendment,
if
there
were
no
question
of
alcohol
involved
and
that
they
prohibit
--
well
i
could
list,
i
can
tick
off
a
list
of
movies
that
couldn't
be
shown
in
a
bar
under
these
rules.
the
catch
22,
summer
of
42,
i
could
tick
off
a
list
of
master
works
of
arts
including
probably
half
of
the
output
of
picasso
that
couldn't
be
shown.
so,
let
me
ask
a
rhetorical
question.
could
a
state
require
bars
to
be
racially
segregated,
after
holding
hearing
wherein
police
officers
testify
that
fights
between
persons
of
opposites
races
are
more
likely
to
occur
when
they
are
drinking,
and
therefore,
the
state
says
that
bars
are
required
to
be
racially
segregated.
i
say
it
could
not
do
so.
that
would
an
impermissible
conflict
between
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
state's
police
power
over
alcohol.
similarly,
i
think
in
this
case
the
state
cannot
make
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
simply
because
alcohol
is
involved.
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
burger's
question
at
the
beginning,
let
me
distinguish
this
between
a
rule
that
says
a
bar
cannot
be
located
say
within
600
feet
of
a
church
as
california
does.
california
says,
you
cannot
put
a
bar
within
600
feet
of
a
church.
the
california
does
not
say
and
i
submit
it,
it
could
not
say
that
you
cannot
put
a
church
within
600
feet
of
a
bar
and
california
does
not
say
if
you
have
a
bar
in
a
place
and
a
church
comes
in
within
600
feet
that
the
bar
has
to
go.
because
i
would
also
say
this
that
the
rule
respecting
for
example,
distance
to
churches
is
intended
to
protect
the
persons
who
go
to
the
churches.
these
rules
are
intended
and
expressly
intended
to
control
what
the
people
do
inside
the
bar
without
regard
to
where
it
is
located
without
regard
to
what
effect
it
may
have
on
anyone
else
outside
the
bar.
so,
there
is
a
clear
distinction
here
between
this
type
of
a
rule
which
directly
applies
to
the
conduct
inside
of
a
bar
which
directly
restricts
what
can
go
on
inside
a
bar.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
i
don't
think
it
is.
suppose
the
church
had
that
type
of
rule.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
alright
suppose
the
state
has
a
rule.
no
sale
of
liquor
at
bookstore
or
at
a
church.
that
does
not
mean
that
a
bar
automatically
becomes
a
bookstore
or
church
because
it
happens
to
sell
a
book
or
because
it
happens
to
conduct
religious
services.
it
is
a
question
of
where
the
classification
--
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
no
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
where
the
class.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
no
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
this
rule
purports
to
regulate
the
content
of
the
--
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
what
this
rule
says
and
i
think
this
is
important,
i
don't
think
its
just
a
case
of
how
you
put
it.
this
rules
discriminates
between
types
of
entertainment.
it
says,
entertainment
can
take
place
inside
of
bar
except
that
the
entertainment
can't
have
this
and
it
can't
have
that
and
can't
have
something
else.
i
think
this
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
between
types
of
entertainment
and
that
i
think
the
constitution
would
require
that
type
of
a
discrimination
to
be
made
on
the
basis
of
obscenity.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
first.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
first
and
fourteenth,
it's
not
a
direct
application
to
the
first
through
the
fourteenth.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
well,
it's
obviously
both.
it
is
both
a
licensing
case
and
the
first
amendment
case.
it
involves
as
i
said
originally,
the
conflict
between
the
first
amendment
and
the
licensing
power
and
i
don't
think
that,
as
i
have
said,
i
don't
think
this
is
a
mere
question
of
terminology
and
how
you
put
it.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
i
think
there
is
just
a
general
rule
that
says
that
the
bars
have
to
be
--
have
sufficient
light
for
investigators
to
see
what's
going
on
when
they
walk
in.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
that
would
be
different
because
that
is
not,
that
would
be
an
example
of
an
incidental
restriction
on
a
first
amendment
right
of
the
type,
the
o'brien
type.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
no,
i
don't
think
entertainment
is
incidental.
i
think
is
entertainment
is
a
direct
first
amendment
activity.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
not
necessarily,
in
many
of
these
places
that
may
be.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
i
would
agree
with
that
justice
marshall.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
that
is
correct
justice
marshall.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
well
i
would
say
this
they
are
incidental
--
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
i
would
agree
with
that
i
don't
agree
with
that,
i
don't
disagree
with
that
proposition,
but
i
do
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
the
department
of
alcohol
and
beverage
control
can
do
whatever
it
pleases
without
regard
to
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
participants.
i
don't
think
that
the
department
of
alcohol
and
beverage
control
could
condition
the
issuance
of
the
license
upon
the
applicant
taking
the
oath
that
this
court
held
was
unconstitutional
in
speiser
versus
randall.
i
don't
think
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
could
condition
the
issuance
of
a
license
upon
the
licensee
filling
out
the
questionnaire
that
this
court
held
unconstitutional,
i
am
forgetting
the
name
of
case,
the
arkansas
case.
i
don't
think
the
arkansas
school
teacher
case,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
right,
sheton
against
tucker.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
state
couldn't
do
that
and
i
don't
think
the
state
can
condition
the
issuance
of
a
license
upon
the
refusal
of
the
licensee
to
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights
in
a
manner
which
discriminates
the
way
this
rule
discriminates,
the
way
rule
discriminates
between
types
of
entertainment.
i
don't
think
a
state
can
say,
you
can
show
bambi
but
you
can't
show
summer
of
42
inside
the
bar,
that's
what
i
think
is
the
unlawful
discrimination.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
the
joint
pre
trial
statement,
i
think
contained
those
elements
that
there
was
a
reparable
harm
and
there
would
be
reparable
harm
in
the
enforcement
of
these
rules
and
that
the
remedy
at
law
was
inadequate.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
no
i
don't
think
it
was
impermissible.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
if
the
court
refers
to
the
record
there
was
a
direct
pretrial
statement
filed
joined
in
by
all
parties
and
the
court
in
which
the
statements
that
there
was
irremediable
harm
here
and
that
this
would
exist
if
there
was
no
injunction.
now
if
judge
ferguson
neglected
to
put
that
in
his
opinion
i
don't
think
that
removes
jurisdiction,
that
is
in
the
record.
it's
also
the
case
of
the
state
courts
as
we
have
said
did
refuse
to
take
the
case.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
earlier
there
is
a
type
of
declaratory
relief
remedy
available
and
that
is
what
was
done
in
this
case
because
the
state
of
california
in
a
liquor
case
requires
you
to
go
to
the
appellate
courts
rather
than
the
trial
courts
level
and
the
appellate
courts
apparently
have
the
discretion
to
refuse
to
take
the
case
which
is
--
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
that's
right.
that's
a
discretionary
denial
of
a
relief
it
can't
be
available
and
there
was
no
place
left
to
go.
so
that
the
attempts
to
exhaust,
take
the
state
remedy
had
been
exhausted.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
please
the
court.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
this
case
involves
a
conflict
between
the
state's
police
power

and
the

over-broad

if
there
were
no

and
that
they

--
well
i
could
list,
i
can
tick
off
a

of
movies
that
couldn't
be
shown
in
a
bar
under
these
rules.
the
catch
22,
summer
of
42,
i
could
tick
off
a
list
of
master
works
of
arts
including
probably
half
of
the
output
of
picasso
that
couldn't
be
shown.
so,
let

that

suppose

mr.

alright
suppose

a
liquor
case
requires
you
to
go
to
the
appellate
courts
rather
than
the
trial
courts
level
and
the
appellate
courts
apparently
have
the
discretion
to
refuse
to
take
the
case
which
is
--
mr.
kenneth
scholtz
that's
right.
that's
a
discretionary
denial
of
a
relief
it
can't
be
available
and
there
was
no
place
left
to
go.
so
that
the
attempts
to
exhaust,
take
the
state
remedy
had
been
exhausted.
thank
you.
