mr.
porter,
does
your
argument
here,
does
it
based
it
all
on
the
twenty-first
amendment,
dealing
with
the
state
authority
over
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hertzberg,
is
--
then
the
california
courts
assign
no
reason
for
their
refusal
to
consider
your
petition
none
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
california
have
a
procedure
whereby
one
can
get
a
judicial
review
of
administrative
rule
making
which
i
take
it
was
what
you
sought
here
rather
than
an
administrative
adjudication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hertzberg,
is
it
a
summary
of
your
position
or
is
it
not
fair
to
say
that
you
are
contending
that
what
the
state
because
the
state
can't
prohibit
something
in
a
theater,
it
can
prohibit
it
in
a
bar
either?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
a
discretionary
denial
of
a
relief
that
is
--
can't
be
available
under
california
law?
