mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
rules
set
for
grounds
for
disciplinary
proceedings
against
a
alcoholic
beverage
control
licensee.
these
rules
say
in
effect
that
if
you
permit
entertainment,
which
entertainment
has
these
acts,
specific
acts,
that's
grounds
to
discipline
you
suspend
or
revoke
you
liquor
license.
it's
our
contention
that
as
a
condition
of
the
exercise
of
that
license,
you
cannot
deprive
an
individual
be
she
or
he
a
dancer
as
there
are
plaintiffs
in
this
case
or
a
licensee
before
going
to
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
don't
believe
that
a
state
could
validly
say
that
liquor
by
the
drink
should
not
be
sold
in
bookstores.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
believe
they
could
stay
that
across
the
street
from
the
school,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
state
of
california
says
within
600
feet
of
school
or
a
church.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
say
that
is
merely
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
when
you
say
that
liquor
cannot
be
sold
at
a
bookstore,
you're
saying
no
differently
than
you
can't
read
a
book
in
a
bar.
i
think
you're
doing
indirectly
that
a
state
cannot
do
directly
by
prohibiting
fee
speech.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
well,
first
of
all
these
rules
don't
say
that.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
the
rules
turned
around.
in
this
case
they
are
bad
and
over,
however,
traditionally
in
this
country
you
had
political
discussions,
you
had
entertainment
in
bars
where
liquor
is
sold
which
is
part
of
an
inherent
and
i
think
of
first
amendment
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
limit,
you
prescribe
that
liquor
cannot
be
sold
in
a
bookstore
you
are
discriminating
against
those
people
who
want
to
read
books
and
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights
while
drinking,
those
who
do
not.
when
you
have
a
monopoly
state
and
don't
permit
liquor
to
be
sold
anywhere
in
that
state
you
are
treating
all
people
alike,
you
may
have
very
serious
fourteenth
amendment
problem
with
the
type
regulation
which
you
specify.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
if
you
can
show
state
of
california
has
scientific
evidence
in
some
kind
of
a
legislative
hearing
that
would
constitutionally
permit
them
to
find
that
there
were
some
logical
and
reasonable
correlation
between
the
sale
of
gasoline
where
liquor
sold
then
i
would
say,
yes.
but
more
so
in
a
first
amendment
right
situation
and
that's
we
have
here.
going
back
to
the
legislative
hearings
in
this
case,
i
contend,
and
we
contend
that
the
state
of
california
must
show
some
logical
and
reasonable
correlation
between
the
drinking
of
liquor
while
watching
a
nude
girl
dance
or
a
movie
or
even
a
television
which
some
of
the
shows
on
television
today
would
be
prohibited
by
these
rules
and
a
kind
that
occurs
outside
the
premises
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason
mr.
chief
justice,
that
each
and
every
act
complained
of
in
pray
to
horribles
listed
in
the
brief
of
appellant
herein
is
either
prescribed
by
california
statute
today,
none
of
plaintiffs
might
and
that
i
represent,
there
is
over
20
of
them
here,
obviously
during
this
kind
of
conduct,
were
judged
by,
they
are
judged
by
the
normal
rules
of
obscenity
and
that's
all
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
judge
it
no
differently
then
they
would
judge
any
other
first
amendment
right.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
well
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
submit
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
these
hearings,
if
the
court
will
refer
to
the
entire
text
of
them,
you'll
find
that
they
invited
every
law
enforcement
officer,
practically
everyone,
district
attorney,
city
attorney
and
attorney
general
to
testify,
and
police
officer.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
you
can
lose
your
license,
yes,
yes
there
is.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
no
i
have
never
gone
after
that
regulation
because
appellate
hearing
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
oh!
they
have
lot
of
power
over
the
bar,
but
i
don't
think
they
have
the
power
to
dispel
your
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
there
is
no
question,
but
that
there
is
a
greater
police
power
over
the
bar
than
there
is
over
bookstore.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
couldn't
stand
here
and
deny
it
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
don't
think
that
the
power
is
that
strong
and
in
this
instance
here,
after
three
days
of
hearings,
the
record
will
reveal
that
since
this
entertainment
commenced
in
los
angeles,
the
entire
state
of
california,
they
established
outside
of
the
premises,
that
they
were
four
indecent
exposures,
one
attempted
rape,
one
actual
rape
by
alleged
patrons
and
two
general
statements
that
crime
was
on
the
increase
and
that's
after
three
days
of
testimony,
inviting
every
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
state
to
testify.
each
and
every
one
of
the
pray
to
horribles
here
is
grounds
for
disciplining
a
license
of
the
licensee.
there
is
no
need
as
these
rules
in
this
case
before
this
court
at
this
time
to
take
away
the
first
amendment
rights
which
we
feel
would
be
taken
away
as
a
condition
of
the
exertion
of
a
privilege
because
here
we're
not
talking
about
the
type
of
conduct
as
the
appellant
alleges
occurred
in
o'brien,
this
is
directly
communicated
activity.
i
don't
stand
here
and
ask
this
court
to
think
or
believe
that
every
bar
in
the
city
of
california
carries
out
the
type
of
activity
which
the
appellant
picked
out
and
chose
to
put
in
his
brief
in
this
case.
these
are
by
far
the
exception.
if
in
california,
or
any
state
i
would
believe,
any
activity
occurs
of
this
nature,
any
contact
between
a
patron
and
a
entertainer,
it
would
be
prescribed
in
addition
thereto
if
it's
the
liquor,
if
the
liquor
is
the
added
element
in
this
case,
which
appellant
seeks
to
use
to
invade
the
constitutional
right
then
why
not
remove
the
liquor
if
we
can
to
the
best
extent
in
the
from
bloodstream
of
the
patron
and
we
do
that
in
california
by
saying,
we
have
cited
section
647
(f),
that
you
are
not
permitted
to
remain
on
the
premises
if
you
are
under
the
influence
or
if
you
are
not
the
influence
you
are
no
different
than
anybody
else.
so
you
should
not
be
there
in
the
first
place
and
if
they
are
going
to
be
inside
the
bar
to
police
it
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
any
violation
of
your
--
of
the
alleged
rules
they
might
as
will
just
take
the
people
that
are
under
the
influence
and
get
them
out
of
the
bar.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
my
brother
schultz
will
probably
argue
that
point
in
that
we
feel
that
the
state
could
not
validly
exclude
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
the
lobbies
on
the
same
theory
that
we
argue
here
because
there
is
no
rationale
or
scientific
showing
that
the
drinking
of
that
alcohol
will
result
in
any
criminal
activity.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
have
no
case
on
it
except
this
court
decided,
in
its
variable
obscenity
cases,
the
sam
ginsberg
case
in
which
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
obscenity
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
selling
liquor
in
the
lobby
of
the
theater.
we
just
feel
that
if
a
man
has
a
liquor
license
and
he
operates
a
theater
and
the
sale
of
the
liquor
is
a
necessary
element
to
his
operation,
then
what
you’re
doing
is
you’re
placing
upon
the
patrons
of
that
theater
and
the
owner
an
unconstitutional
burden
and
carving
away
the
first
amendment
rights
of
what
you
can
show
if
you
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
true
the
way
you
pose
your
question,
it
doesn’t
meet
identically
the
rules
in
this
case.
this
case
is
a
different
case
than
your
question.
however,
i
believe
it
would
indirectly
create
the
identical
himself.
that
is,
if
you
say
to
a
man
he
can't
sell
liquor
in
the
lobby
of
the
theater
and
he
sells
liquor
in
the
lobby
of
the
theater,
he
will
either
lose
his
license
or
he
will
be
criminally
prosecuted.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
first
amendment
sir.
now
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
yes.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
agree
to
it.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
no,
first
amendment
right
the
state
could
do
that.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
well,
other
than
the
fact
that
it
may
discriminate
against
iron
foundry
workers
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
probably
we
will
be
able
to
look
at
that.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
think
that’s
a
reasonable
discrimination.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
if
the
court
please,
historically
--
well,
what
we
have
to
argue
at
this
time,
the
regulations
as
they
come
before
this
court.
briefly
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
initial
younger
versus
harris
argument,
we
filed
this
action
originally
on
behalf
of
plaintiffs
in
the
superior
court
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
for
declaratory
relief
and
requested
an
injunction
in
superior
court
which
is
the
trial
court
and
we
were
denied
hearing.
we
petitioned
the
district
court
of
appeals
for
writ
of
mandate
and
we
were
denied
hearing.
we
petitioned
supreme
court
in
state
of
california
and
we
were
denied
hearing,
both
on
behalf
of
entertainer
dancers
and
bar
owners.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
no
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
merely
a
postcard
saying
which
i
--
as
the
appellate
herein
says
he
requested
a
hearing
along
within
us
in
supreme
court,
and
it
was
denied
on
both
sides.
the
dissent
in
the
federal
district
court
below
did
feel
that
there
was
a
younger
versus
harris
problem,
but
we
went
through
every
court
in
the
state
and
didn't
get
heard.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
well,
i
very
honestly
state
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
know
one
thing
that
the
california
supreme
court
like
this
court
doesn’t
like
to
give
advisory
opinions
and
whether
that
was
their
theory
or
not
would
really
be
conjuncture
on
my
part.
however,
in
california,
you
can
only
contest
a
disciplinary
proceeding
on
a
liquor
license
by
going
through
certain
administrative
procedures.
we
filed
a
complaint
in
this
case
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
rules
to
enjoin,
i
believe
it
may
have
been
concurrently
therewith
to
enjoin
their
enforced
on
the
theory
that
it
would
be
irreparable
damage
of
which
the
appellant
agreed,
they
were
going
to
enforce
them
and
that
the
loss
of
these
licenses
would
be
irreparable.
we
did
not
wait
until
the
licenses
were
revoked
or
until
disciplinary
proceedings
had
been
instituted.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
would
have
answered
that
question
in
this
regard,
i
will
defer
the
answer
to
mr.
scholtz.
i
believe
a
declaratory
relief
probably
could.
we
would
submit
further
that
the
way
rules
are
drafted,
they
are
overbreadth
the
smith
versus
california
problem
which
mr.
scholtz
will
take
up
with
the
court,
are
such
that
or
in
a
manner
that
they
do
deny
the
licensees
herein
the
proper
exercise,
the
licensees
and
the
dancer
plaintiffs,
the
proper
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights
as
a
condition
to
the
owning
of
a
liquor
license,
no
different
than
naacp
versus
button
and
those
line
of
cases
requiring
the
foregoing
of
an
old
etcetera
to
maintain
the
license.
that's
the
basis
of
our
argument
herein.
the
district
court
below
said
that
if
it
is
not
obscene
then
something
is
wrong
with
it
and
they
can't
take
your
license
away
because
obscenity
has
been
the
standard
since
1957,
decided
by
this
court
in
roth,
but
to
accept
these
rules
taking
things
out
of
context
and
merely
saying
if
an
act
simulates,
an
act
that
simulates,
whatever
that
may
be,
that's
grounds
for
disciplinary
proceeding
even
if
it
is
in
a
picture
on
the
wall
because
it
involves
movies,
still
pictures
and
entertainment
of
any
kind
of
nature
whatsoever.
the
injunction
granted
in
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case,
specifically
accepted
any
contact
between
any
entertainer
and
any
patron,
person
in
the
bar
which
are
90%
of
the
pray
to
horribles
listed
in
the
briefs,
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellant
herein.
we
submit
that
from
time
immemorial,
dancing,
entertainment
of
that
kind
as
this
court
said
in
stanley
versus
georgia
the
line
is
too
illusive
to
draw
between
conveying
ideas
and
entertainment
that
whether
it
is
vulgar,
whether
it
is
refined,
whether
it
is
ugly
or
whether
it
is
elegant
receive
the
same
protection
and
that
test
the
obscenity
test
as
has
been
laid
down
so
strong
and
hard.
to
sustain
the
rules
in
this
case
would
take
us
back
to
hicklin,
prior
to
roth.
the
activity,
dancing
is
direct
communication.
this
is
not
as
i
previously
said
an
o'brien
case.
in
o'brien,
this
court
held
that
when
speech
and
non-speech
elements
are
combined
in
the
same
course
of
conduct,
a
sufficiently
governmental
interest
in
regulating
the
non-speech
element
can
just
defy
incidental
limitations
on
first
amendment
freedoms.
but,
the
court
further
went
on
in
o'brien
and
stated,
referring
to
stromberg
versus
california,
the
red
flag
waving
case,
since
the
statue
there,
in
san
bernardino,
california
was
aimed
at
suppressing
communication.
it
could
not
be
sustained
as
a
regulation
of
non-communicative
conduct,
citing
brandenburg
versus
ohio
which
came
later,
brandenburg
versus
ohio
which
required
the
incitement
to
action.
we
submit
that
the
conduct
here,
or
the
content
of
the
conduct
here
cannot
be
changed
from
speech
to
symbolic
speech
or
non-speech
merely
by
changing
the
name.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
rules
set
for
grounds
for
disciplinary
proceedings
against
a
alcoholic
beverage
control
licensee.
these
rules
say
in
effect
that
if
you
permit
entertainment,
which
entertainment
has
these
acts,
specific
acts,
that's
grounds
to
discipline
you
suspend
or
revoke
you
liquor
license.
it's
our
contention
that
as
a
condition
of
the
exercise
of
that
license,
you
cannot
deprive
an
individual
be
she
or
he
a
dancer
as
there
are
plaintiffs
in
this
case
or
a
licensee
before
going
to
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
don't
believe
that
a
state
could
validly
say
that
liquor
by
the
drink
should
not
be
sold
in
bookstores.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
believe
they
could
stay
that
across
the
street
from
the
school,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
state
of
california
says
within
600
feet
of
school
or
a
church.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
say
that
is
merely
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
when
you
say
that
liquor
cannot
be
sold
at
a
bookstore,
you're
saying
no
differently
than
you
can't
read
a
book
in
a
bar.
i
think
you're
doing
indirectly
that
a
state
cannot
do
directly
by
prohibiting
fee
speech.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
well,
first
of
all
these
rules
don't
say
that.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
the
rules
turned
around.
in
this
case
they
are
bad
and
over,
however,
traditionally
in
this
country
you
had
political
discussions,
you
had
entertainment
in
bars
where
liquor
is
sold
which
is
part
of
an
inherent
and
i
think
of
first
amendment
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
limit,
you
prescribe
that
liquor
cannot
be
sold
in
a
bookstore
you
are
discriminating
against
those
people
who
want
to
read
books
and
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights
while
drinking,
those
who
do
not.
when
you
have
a
monopoly
state
and
don't
permit
liquor
to
be
sold
anywhere
in
that
state
you
are
treating
all
people
alike,
you
may
have
very
serious
fourteenth
amendment
problem
with
the
type
regulation
which
you
specify.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
if
you
can
show
state
of
california
has
scientific
evidence
in
some
kind
of
a
legislative
hearing
that
would
constitutionally
permit
them
to
find
that
there
were
some
logical
and
reasonable
correlation
between
the
sale
of
gasoline
where
liquor
sold
then
i
would
say,
yes.
but
more
so
in
a
first
amendment
right
situation
and
that's
we
have
here.
going
back
to
the
legislative
hearings
in
this
case,
i
contend,
and
we
contend
that
the
state
of
california
must
show
some
logical
and
reasonable
correlation
between
the
drinking
of
liquor
while
watching
a
nude
girl
dance
or
a
movie
or
even
a
television
which
some
of
the
shows
on
television
today
would
be
prohibited
by
these
rules
and
a
kind
that
occurs
outside
the
premises
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason
mr.
chief
justice,
that
each
and
every
act
complained
of
in
pray
to
horribles
listed
in
the
brief
of
appellant
herein
is
either
prescribed
by
california
statute
today,
none
of
plaintiffs
might
and
that
i
represent,
there
is
over
20
of
them
here,
obviously
during
this
kind
of
conduct,
were
judged
by,
they
are
judged
by
the
normal
rules
of
obscenity
and
that's
all
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
judge
it
no
differently
then
they
would
judge
any
other
first
amendment
right.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
well
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
submit
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
these
hearings,
if
the
court
will
refer
to
the
entire
text
of
them,
you'll
find
that
they
invited
every
law
enforcement
officer,
practically
everyone,
district
attorney,
city
attorney
and
attorney
general
to
testify,
and
police
officer.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
you
can
lose
your
license,
yes,
yes
there
is.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
no
i
have
never
gone
after
that
regulation
because
appellate
hearing
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
oh!
they
have
lot
of
power
over
the
bar,
but
i
don't
think
they
have
the
power
to
dispel
your
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
there
is
no
question,
but
that
there
is
a
greater
police
power
over
the
bar
than
there
is
over
bookstore.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
couldn't
stand
here
and
deny
it
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
don't
think
that
the
power
is
that
strong
and
in
this
instance
here,
after
three
days
of
hearings,
the
record
will
reveal
that
since
this
entertainment
commenced
in
los
angeles,
the
entire
state
of
california,
they
established
outside
of
the
premises,
that
they
were
four
indecent
exposures,
one
attempted
rape,
one
actual
rape
by
alleged
patrons
and
two
general
statements
that
crime
was
on
the
increase
and
that's
after
three
days
of
testimony,
inviting
every
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
state
to
testify.
each
and
every
one
of
the
pray
to
horribles
here
is
grounds
for
disciplining
a
license
of
the
licensee.
there
is
no
need
as
these
rules
in
this
case
before
this
court
at
this
time
to
take
away
the
first
amendment
rights
which
we
feel
would
be
taken
away
as
a
condition
of
the
exertion
of
a
privilege
because
here
we're
not
talking
about
the
type
of
conduct
as
the
appellant
alleges
occurred
in
o'brien,
this
is
directly
communicated
activity.
i
don't
stand
here
and
ask
this
court
to
think
or
believe
that
every
bar
in
the
city
of
california
carries
out
the
type
of
activity
which
the
appellant
picked
out
and
chose
to
put
in
his
brief
in
this
case.
these
are
by
far
the
exception.
if
in
california,
or
any
state
i
would
believe,
any
activity
occurs
of
this
nature,
any
contact
between
a
patron
and
a
entertainer,
it
would
be
prescribed
in
addition
thereto
if
it's
the
liquor,
if
the
liquor
is
the
added
element
in
this
case,
which
appellant
seeks
to
use
to
invade
the
constitutional
right
then
why
not
remove
the
liquor
if
we
can
to
the
best
extent
in
the
from
bloodstream
of
the
patron
and
we
do
that
in
california
by
saying,
we
have
cited
section
647
(f),
that
you
are
not
permitted
to
remain
on
the
premises
if
you
are
under
the
influence
or
if
you
are
not
the
influence
you
are
no
different
than
anybody
else.
so
you
should
not
be
there
in
the
first
place
and
if
they
are
going
to
be
inside
the
bar
to
police
it
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
any
violation
of
your
--
of
the
alleged
rules
they
might
as
will
just
take
the
people
that
are
under
the
influence
and
get
them
out
of
the
bar.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
my
brother
schultz
will
probably
argue
that
point
in
that
we
feel
that
the
state
could
not
validly
exclude
the
sale
of
alcohol
in
the
lobbies
on
the
same
theory
that
we
argue
here
because
there
is
no
rationale
or
scientific
showing
that
the
drinking
of
that
alcohol
will
result
in
any
criminal
activity.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
have
no
case
on
it
except
this
court
decided,
in
its
variable
obscenity
cases,
the
sam
ginsberg
case
in
which
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
obscenity
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
selling
liquor
in
the
lobby
of
the
theater.
we
just
feel
that
if
a
man
has
a
liquor
license
and
he
operates
a
theater
and
the
sale
of
the
liquor
is
a
necessary
element
to
his
operation,
then
what
you’re
doing
is
you’re
placing
upon
the
patrons
of
that
theater
and
the
owner
an
unconstitutional
burden
and
carving
away
the
first
amendment
rights
of
what
you
can
show
if
you
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
true
the
way
you
pose
your
question,
it
doesn’t
meet
identically
the
rules
in
this
case.
this
case
is
a
different
case
than
your
question.
however,
i
believe
it
would
indirectly
create
the
identical
himself.
that
is,
if
you
say
to
a
man
he
can't
sell
liquor
in
the
lobby
of
the
theater
and
he
sells
liquor
in
the
lobby
of
the
theater,
he
will
either
lose
his
license
or
he
will
be
criminally
prosecuted.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
first
amendment
sir.
now
--
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
yes.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
agree
to
it.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
no,
first
amendment
right
the
state
could
do
that.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
well,
other
than
the
fact
that
it
may
discriminate
against
iron
foundry
workers
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
probably
we
will
be
able
to
look
at
that.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
think
that’s
a
reasonable
discrimination.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
if
the
court
please,
historically
--
well,
what
we
have
to
argue
at
this
time,
the
regulations
as
they
come
before
this
court.
briefly
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
initial
younger
versus
harris
argument,
we
filed
this
action
originally
on
behalf
of
plaintiffs
in
the
superior
court
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
for
declaratory
relief
and
requested
an
injunction
in
superior
court
which
is
the
trial
court
and
we
were
denied
hearing.
we
petitioned
the
district
court
of
appeals
for
writ
of
mandate
and
we
were
denied
hearing.
we
petitioned
supreme
court
in
state
of
california
and
we
were
denied
hearing,
both
on
behalf
of
entertainer
dancers
and
bar
owners.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
no
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
merely
a
postcard
saying
which
i
--
as
the
appellate
herein
says
he
requested
a
hearing
along
within
us
in
supreme
court,
and
it
was
denied
on
both
sides.
the
dissent
in
the
federal
district
court
below
did
feel
that
there
was
a
younger
versus
harris
problem,
but
we
went
through
every
court
in
the
state
and
didn't
get
heard.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
well,
i
very
honestly
state
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
know
one
thing
that
the
california
supreme
court
like
this
court
doesn’t
like
to
give
advisory
opinions
and
whether
that
was
their
theory
or
not
would
really
be
conjuncture
on
my
part.
however,
in
california,
you
can
only
contest
a
disciplinary
proceeding
on
a
liquor
license
by
going
through
certain
administrative
procedures.
we
filed
a
complaint
in
this
case
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
rules
to
enjoin,
i
believe
it
may
have
been
concurrently
therewith
to
enjoin
their
enforced
on
the
theory
that
it
would
be
irreparable
damage
of
which
the
appellant
agreed,
they
were
going
to
enforce
them
and
that
the
loss
of
these
licenses
would
be
irreparable.
we
did
not
wait
until
the
licenses
were
revoked
or
until
disciplinary
proceedings
had
been
instituted.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
i
would
have
answered
that
question
in
this
regard,
i
will
defer
the
answer
to
mr.
scholtz.
i
believe
a
declaratory
relief
probably
could.
we
would
submit
further
that
the
way
rules
are
drafted,
they
are
overbreadth
the
smith
versus
california
problem
which
mr.
scholtz
will
take
up
with
the
court,
are
such
that
or
in
a
manner
that
they
do
deny
the
licensees
herein
the
proper
exercise,
the
licensees
and
the
dancer
plaintiffs,
the
proper
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights
as
a
condition
to
the
owning
of
a
liquor
license,
no
different
than
naacp
versus
button
and
those
line
of
cases
requiring
the
foregoing
of
an
old
etcetera
to
maintain
the
license.
that's
the
basis
of
our
argument
herein.
the
district
court
below
said
that
if
it
is
not
obscene
then
something
is
wrong
with
it
and
they
can't
take
your
license
away
because
obscenity
has
been
the
standard
since
1957,
decided
by
this
court
in
roth,
but
to
accept
these
rules
taking
things
out
of
context
and
merely
saying
if
an
act
simulates,
an
act
that
simulates,
whatever
that
may
be,
that's
grounds
for
disciplinary
proceeding
even
if
it
is
in
a
picture
on
the
wall
because
it
involves
movies,
still
pictures
and
entertainment
of
any
kind
of
nature
whatsoever.
the
injunction
granted
in
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case,
specifically
accepted
any
contact
between
any
entertainer
and
any
patron,
person
in
the
bar
which
are
90%
of
the
pray
to
horribles
listed
in
the
briefs,
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellant
herein.
we
submit
that
from
time
immemorial,
dancing,
entertainment
of
that
kind
as
this
court
said
in
stanley
versus
georgia
the
line
is
too
illusive
to
draw
between
conveying
ideas
and
entertainment
that
whether
it
is
vulgar,
whether
it
is
refined,
whether
it
is
ugly
or
whether
it
is
elegant
receive
the
same
protection
and
that
test
the
obscenity
test
as
has
been
laid
down
so
strong
and
hard.
to
sustain
the
rules
in
this
case
would
take
us
back
to
hicklin,
prior
to
roth.
the
activity,
dancing
is
direct
communication.
this
is
not
as
i
previously
said
an
o'brien
case.
in
o'brien,
this
court
held
that
when
speech
and
non-speech
elements
are
combined
in
the
same
course
of
conduct,
a
sufficiently
governmental
interest
in
regulating
the
non-speech
element
can
just
defy
incidental
limitations
on
first
amendment
freedoms.
but,
the
court
further
went
on
in
o'brien
and
stated,
referring
to
stromberg
versus
california,
the
red
flag
waving
case,
since
the
statue
there,
in
san
bernardino,
california
was
aimed
at
suppressing
communication.
it
could
not
be
sustained
as
a
regulation
of
non-communicative
conduct,
citing
brandenburg
versus
ohio
which
came
later,
brandenburg
versus
ohio
which
required
the
incitement
to
action.
we
submit
that
the
conduct
here,
or
the
content
of
the
conduct
here
cannot
be
changed
from
speech
to
symbolic
speech
or
non-speech
merely
by
changing
the
name.
mr.
harrison
w.
hertzberg
that
is
correct.
