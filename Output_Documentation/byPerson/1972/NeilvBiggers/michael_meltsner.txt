mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
far
from
accidental
that
with
respect
to
the
consequence
of
a
four-four
affirmance,
the
state
relies
on
the
statute
here.
it
goes
--
its
position
of
that
a
four-four
affirmance
would
bar
an
initial
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
claiming
a
denial
of
due
process,
fails
to
come
to
terms
with
several
principles
which
have
been
quite
prominent
in
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
area.
the
first
is
that
a
state
court’s
disposition
of
a
state
prisoner’s
federal
constitutional
question
is
not
a
conclusive
determination
of
that
question,
and
that
each
state
prisoner
will
at
least
have
one
opportunity
to
obtain
a
resolution
of
this
federal
constitutional
claim
in
a
federal
forum.
when
this
court
affirms
by
an
equal
division,
it
merely
leaves
standing
a
state
court
determination
of
federal
question,
whatever
it
is.
indeed
one
can
imagine
quite
easily
the
court
affirming
by
an
equal
division
to
totally
inconsistent
lower
court
decisions.
yet,
the
position
taken
by
the
state
here
would
convert
this
state
court
disposition
of
a
federal
constitutional
question
into
an
absolute
bar
that
will
be
habeas
corpus.
mr.
michael
meltsner
right.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
difference
is
that
in
this
situation
congress
has
decided
to
make
federal
habeas
corpus
available
to
the
petitioner
for
collateral
attack.
mr.
michael
meltsner
actually
decided.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
which
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
only
difference
would
be
that
again,
if
i
understand
your
question
that
in
the
latter
situation,
suppose
this
court
would
have
four-four
affirmed
this
case
at
this
point
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
it
was
here
on
direct
review.
mr.
michael
meltsner
a
direct
review.
mr.
michael
meltsner
but
if
this
court
were
to
four-four
affirm
now
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
--
at
least
there
would
be
a
federal
court’s
determination
of
the
federal
question
standing.
and
one
of
the
statutes
involved
in
the
case,
2109,
of
the
judicial
code
makes
quite
clear
that
in
congress’
contemplation
at
least,
the
highest
court
that
can
determine
this
question
ought
to
determine
it
where
this
court
is
disabled,
because
of
a
four-four
split
from
hearing
it.
the
second
principle
though
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
from
deciding
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
from
deciding
it.
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
what
a
four-four
affirmance
is,
is
what
a
technical
rule
of
judicial
administration,
it’s
an
action
out
of
necessity,
it’s
something
that
the
court
does
because
it
cannot
do
anything
else.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it’s
close
to
it
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
--
in
the
first
case
that
the
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
on
question
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
question
here
and
the
court
has
made
its
decision
by
a
majority
in
that
case.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
using
the
label
res
judicata
is
somewhat
misleading.
even
in
sanders
versus
the
united
states,
the
court
said,
“there
were
some
principles
of
finality
which
govern
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.”
but
they
were
to
be
employed
by
use
of
equitable
principles.
and
sanders
sets
forth
situation
where
let's
say,
abuse
of
the
writ
is
involved,
where
a
federal
district
court
can
say,
“no,
i
am
not
going
to
determine
this
question.”
of
course,
another
court
has
heard
and
decided.
now,
whether
it's
called
res
judicata
or
stare
decisis
or
a
principle
of
finality,
i
don’t
think
there's
a
district
judge
inland
who
would
re-litigate
a
question
which
was
fully
considered
by
this
court
,and
decided
by
this
court
unless
they
were
either
a
change
in
law
or
new
factual
--
material
factual
matter
that
was
presented,
which
made
the
federal
constitutional
question
a
different
one,
in
kind,
from
the
one
this
court
decided.
now,
i
do
not
believe
that
res
judicata
or
any
principle
of
finality
would
jurisdictionally
bar
a
federal
district
court
from
considering
a
habeas
petition
in
that
circumstance.
but
absent
those
circumstances,
it’s
plain
to
me
that
there
would
be
no
--
there
would
be
no
--
there
will
be
no
equity
in
the
petition,
and
that
it
would
not
be
heard.
now,
it's
interesting
that
the
statute
which
the
state
here
relies
on
heavily
in
light
of
the
principle
i
mentioned,
and
also
in
light
of
the
general
principle
that
technical
adjudication
is
used,
short
of
the
merits
are
not
sufficient
to
bar
federal
habeas
corpus.
the
procedural
rules
emanating
from
the
process
of
direct
review
do
not
bar
federal
habeas
corpus,
unless
they
amount
to
a
deliberate
bypass
or
an
actual
determination
of
federal
question,
the
state
comes
to
the
statute.
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
congress
sought
to
deal
with
this
problem,
and
it's
this
deal
in
my
judgment
that
suggests
the
contrary.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes,
the
judgment
of
the
--
my
understanding
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
is
affirmed
in
the
same
way
that
the
process
of
direct
review
is
ended
when
this
court
denied
cert.
mr.
michael
meltsner
actually
adjudicated
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
i
think
what
is
clearly
intended
is
that
there
is
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
question.
and
the
statute
would
make
little
sense
if
that
language
was
not
read
that
way,
because
in
a
statute
after
stating
that
an
actual
adjudication
will
bar
subsequent
relief
by
habeas
corpus,
the
statute
goes
on
to
define
that
situation
where
a
new
material
of
fact
has
been
alleged,
and
it
was
not
avoided
in
the
past
because
of
lack
of
due
diligence,
and
describes
that
in
that
situation
federal
habeas
corpus
will,
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
if
it
said
a
judgment,
we
would
have
it
at
least,
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
we’d
have
a
somewhat
different
case,
because
there's
no
explanation
for
the
use
of
the
word
actual
in
this
statute,
unless
congress
meant
something
more
than
technical
affirmance
of
the
sort
we’re
dealing
with
here.
now
congress
has
passed
in
2109
of
the
judicial
code,
a
statute
which
expressly
equates
the
lack
of
a
forum
by
this
court
with
a
four-four
affirmance.
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
congress
sought
to
change
its
understanding
of
what
a
four-four
affirmance
meant.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
--
clearly
what
the
draftsmen
of
the
statute
had
in
mind.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes,
of
course.
mr.
michael
meltsner
of
course
there
is.
and
a
denial
of
certiorari
as
i’ve
indicated
has
no
precedential
value.
it
ends
the
process
of
direct
review,
and
it
does
not
bar
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
this
time.
and
i
think
the
functional
effect
of
a
four-four
affirmance
is
and
ought
to
be
the
same.
additionally,
the
legislative
history
can
be
as
it
is,
suggests
that
the
problem
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
was
abuse
of
the
writ,
was
re-litigation
of
it
--
of
questions
that
had
actually
been
decided.
there's
nothing
of
that
sort
here.
cases
arising
at
a
four-four
affirmances
are
hardly
flooding
the
federal
courts.
and
additionally,
i’d
simply
want
to
point
out
that
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
an
intent
to
modify
the
interests
of
justice
standard
which
has
long
been
attached
to
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
and
the
district
judge
in
this
very
case
deciding
why
would
this
determine
the
due
process
issue,
indicated
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
do
so.
in
other
words,
both
the
language,
the
policy,
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
failed
to
suggest
that
congress
had
any
intention
to
change
what
had
generally
been
understood
to
be
the
meaning
of
a
four-four
affirmance,
a
technical
sort
of
response
which
is
simply
a
way
of
disposing
of
the
case
that
this
court
could
not
decide.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
by
definite
--
that
question
has
long
troubled
me
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you.
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
remaining,
i
would
like
to
discuss
petitioner’s
challenge
to
the
factual
findings
made
by
the
district
court
with
respect
to
the
due
process
issue.
findings
which
were
affirmed
by
the
entire
court
of
appeals
below,
that
court
dividing
solely
over
the
question
of
the
consequence
of
the
prior
four
to
four
affirmance
in
this
case.
but
first,
i
would
like
to
reply
briefly
to
a
question
asked
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
which
i
had
either
misheard
or
misunderstood.
justice
rehnquist
asked
me
whether
if
this
court
had
in
this
case
previously
decided
seven
to
two
or
nine
to
nothing
against
the
respondent’s
claim
or
whether
res
judicata
would
in
that
event
had
barred
a
subsequent
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
and
i
answered
yes,
but
i
don’t
think
i
gave
a
sufficiently
distinct
answer.
i
think,
the
answer
is
plainly
with
the
statute
involved
in
this
case,
2244
(c)
would
in
that
event
bar
re-litigation
and
that
is
indeed
the
very
situation,
a
very
abuse
of
the
writ
which
congress
was
addressing
itself
to
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes,
i
was.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct.
i
was
answering
you
in
terms
of
the
sanders'
opinion,
which
was,
of
course,
the
backdrop
against
which
2244
(c)
was
drafted.
now,
as
i
read
the
petitioner’s
brief
here
and
understand
its
argument
yesterday,
the
state
does
not
seriously
contend
that
the
district
court
define
the
standard
of
law
which
it
had
applied
in
this
case
incorrectly.
what
the
district
court
did,
was
treat
the
showup
as
a
suggestive
and
potentially
dangerous
identification
device,
but
not
one
which
was
per
se
unconstitutional.
it
waived
the
showup
and
aggravating
circumstances
in
this
case
against
its
necessity
in
this
case
and
external
indicia
of
reliability,
whether
there
was
anything
which
justified
the
use
of
the
showup.
and
i
think
this
conforms
to
what
the
court
in
curvy
last
term
called
weighing
the
prejudice
to
a
defendant
against
society’s
interest
in
law
enforcement
and
it
conforms
almost
identically
to
the
analytic
process
which
the
court
itself
used
in
simmons
versus
the
united
states
several
terms
ago
nor
do
--
as
i
understand
the
state’s
argument
yesterday
and
its
brief,
nor
does
the
state
seriously
challenge
the
application
of
this
standard
to
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court
and
i
will
have
hopefully
something
to
say
about
that
later.
the
state
concentrates
its
attack
here
on
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
and
as
this
court
generally
does
not
reverse
findings
of
historical
fact,
it
seems
to
me
quite
plain
that
the
state
has
a
very
heavy
burden
to
carry.
mr.
michael
meltsner
correct
mr.
chief
justice
and
my
--
a
good
deal
of
what
i
hope
to
say
is
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
and
then
that
--
the
question
of
support
for
the
district
court’s
findings
of
fact
is
what
i
intend
to
turn
to
now.
a
preliminary
matter,
however,
as
i
understood
mr.
durham
yesterday,
he
said
or
implied
that
the
district
court’s
findings
were
based
on
a
cold
record.
they
were
based
on
the
record
made
on
direct
review.
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
district
court
heard
testimony
from
two
police
officers,
including
the
police
officer
who
is
in-charge
of
the
investigation
of
this
case.
he
heard
testimony
from
the
prosecutors.
he
heard
testimony
from
respondent’s
mother
and
he
heard
expert
testimony
directed
to
the
procedures
used
in
this
case.
the
testimony
--
it
appears
in
the
appendix
from
pages
66
to
134.
it
amplified
the
record
made
on
direct
review,
but
it
did
more
than
that.
it
supplied
the
answers
to
many
questions
which
this
court
asked
me
in
1968
and
i
think
that’s
apparent
from
a
reading
of
that
section
of
the
appendix.
for
example,
the
officer
who
was
in-charge
of
the
investigation,
captain
mcdaniel,
testified
to
the
efforts
he
used
to
put
together
a
lineup
in
the
four
or
so
hours
that
he
tried
to
do
that.
district
court,
after
hearing
his
testimony
which
was
directed
to
showing
that
he
could
not
put
a
lineup
together,
rejected
it.
the
testimony
before
the
district
judge
dealt
with
the
initial
description
given
by
the
prosecutrix
to
the
police
shortly
after
the
crime.
that
appears
on
page
a-74.
it
deals
with
the
question
of
voice
identification
where
the
prosecutrix
according
to
the
district
judge,
and
as
i
will
indicate
later,
or
i
hope
to
show
later,
there
was
a
conflict
between
what
she
had
testified
to
at
trial
and
testified
to
before
the
district
court.
finally,
the
expert
witness
gave
us
opinion
of
the
procedures
used
in
this
case
and
clearly
indicated
that
even
an
imperfect
lineup,
one
where
every
trait
of
the
person
who
was
to
be
seen
by
the
witness
was
not
identical,
was
thought
preferable
in
a
showup.
the
district
court
relied
on
a
good
deal
of
this
evidence
and
that
appears
on
pages
a-41
and
a-42
of
the
record.
so
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
district
court
here
was
not
of
hearing
oral
testimony
in
weighing
credibility.
now,
before
again
talking
about
the
factual
findings
that
the
state
challenges,
i
think,
i
have
to
put
it
in
perspective
by
indicating
simply
what
the
state
does
not
challenge.
the
state
does
not
challenge
most
of
the
factual
conclusions
reached
by
the
district
court.
the
state
does
not
dispute
that
the
evidence
of
the
showup
identification
was
admitted
at
trial
that
the
showup
took
place
between
six
and
seven
months
after
the
crime
that
the
police
described
respondent
to
the
prosecutrix
as
a
suspect
before
the
identification,
that
the
respondent
was
alone
made
to
speak
inflammatory
words
which
was
spoken
by
the
assailant
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
“shut
up
or
i’ll
kill
you”
and
that
the
prosecutrix
relied
to
some
extent
on
this
voice
identification.
he
testified
before
the
district
court
that
she
identified
him
first
before
he
spoke.
but
even
she
conceded
that
her
identification
was
made
more
certain
by
what
he
said.
at
trial,
of
course,
she
said,
in
the
state
court,
she
said
that
the
first
thing
that
made
her
identify
respondent
was
his
voice,
and
this
appears
on
page
17
of
the
record
which
was
before
this
court
in
1968.
it
is
also
undisputed
that
there
was
no
other
evidence
of
guilt
and
identification
evidence
that
the
only
other
eyewitness
to
the
events
could
not
identify
the
respondent
and
that
there
was
no
independent
photo
identification
in
this
case.
so
we
come
to
the
particular
matters
the
state
has
concentrated
its
fire
at.
and
as
i
read
the
brief
and
understand
the
argument,
they
are
basically
three.
one;
whether
a
truly
concerted
effort
was
made
to
hold
the
lineup
in
this
case;
secondly,
the
quality
of
the
initial
description
given
by
the
prosecutrix
to
the
police
shortly
after
the
crime,
and
finally,
the
opportunity
to
observe
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
and
it
is
my
submission
that
in
each
of
these
instances,
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
so
that
no
appellate
tribunal
can
say
that
the
district
court
--
district
court’s
findings
as
to
these
matters
was
clearly
erroneous.
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
holding
in
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
truly
concerted
effort
to
hold
the
lineup
in
this
case
and
no
need
for
speed,
the
record
shows
that
what
this
police
officer
did
over
the
course
of
a
morning
in
trying
to
rind
--
round
up
a
lineup
was
to
check
one
jail
facility
and
phone
another,
but
not
to
go
to
visit.
he
did
not
try
several
other
penal
institutions
that
were
located
in
the
nashville
area,
including
the
state
penitentiary
and
that
there
was
absolutely
no
need
for
speed
in
this
case.
the
crime
was
seven
months
old
and
the
complaining
witness
had
been
perfectly
cooperative
in
the
past
with
the
police.
the
district
court
had
a
good
deal
of
knowledge
about
local
conditions.
he
heard
the
police
officer
testify
in
explanation
of
why
he
did
not
put
together
a
lineup
and
concluded
that
there
was
no
need
for
such
a
prompt
showup
in
this
case.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
initial
opportunity
to
observe
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
district
court
held,
and
this
appears
on
a-41
of
the
appendix
that
the
prosecutrix
clearly
did
not
have
a
good
opportunity.
well,
she,
in
fact,
testified
that
she
saw
the
rapist,
but
the
objective
circumstances
certainly
support
the
district
court’s
conclusion.
she
was
grabbed
from
behind
in
an
unlit
hallway,
marched
out
through
an
unlit
kitchen,
up
on
some
railroad
tracks
where
there
was
some
light
from
the
moon
and
some
overhead
lights
from
the
nearby
street,
but
she
marched
along
these
railroad
tracks
at
the
point
of
a
knife.
and
she
was
marched
along
those
tracks
for
a
block
or
two
and
then
pushed
into
some
overgrowth
where
the
crime
was
--
where
the
crime
took
place
and
then
the
assailant
fled.
now,
given
those
circumstances,
and
the
prosecutrix’s
admission
before
the
district
court
on
page
a-125
that
the
lighting
in
her
house
was
dim,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
a
matter
where
this
court
can
possibly
substitute
its
judgment
as
to
the
opportunity
to
view
the
assailant
for
the
district
courts.
the
third
issue
has
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
initial
description
given
to
the
police
at
the
time
of
the
crime
by
the
woman
who
had
been
raped.
and
here,
the
evidence
before
the
district
court
is
quite
clear,
although
at
the
time
of
trial,
mrs.
beamer,
the
woman
who’d
been
raped,
listed
a
number
of
traits.
she
described
them
as
the
traits
which
led
her
to
identify
the
man
which
she
identified,
the
respondent,
at
the
time
of
the
pretrial
identification.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
which
told
us
what
sort
of
a
description
she’d
given
seven
months
earlier
to
the
police.
well,
before
the
district
court
on
page
a-74,
captain
mcdaniel,
the
chief
officer
involved
in
the
case
was
asked
about
this
specifically
and
he
testified
referring
to
his
notes,
“alright,
sir,
says,
his
height
was
six
feet
tall,
180
pounds,
he
was
dark
hair,
medium
or
medium
to
dark
complexion.”
that
was
the
description
given
by
the
prosecutrix
to
the
police
according
to
this
officer’s
notes.
now
in
light
of
that,
again
it
seems
to
me
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
district
court’s
holding
that
the
initial
description
was
general
can
anyway
be
off
set
as
clearly
erroneous.
that
brings
me
to
a
last
issue
which
is
merely
the
application
of
a
standard
which
i
take
not
to
be
seriously
disputed
to
facts
which
i
do
not
think
this
court
properly
sets
aside
and,
i
think,
any
examination
of
what
lower
courts
have
done
with
stovall
and
any
examination
of
the
decision
of
this
court
which
goes
into
application
of
stovall
in
most
detail
that
being
simmons
will
demonstrate
that
the
district
court
properly
applied
the
standard
to
the
facts.
i
think,
looking
at
simmons
is
quite
constructive.
in
that
case,
the
identification
procedure
which
was
a
photo
identification
was
upheld,
but
looking
at
the
factors
used
in
justice
harlan’s
analysis
in
that
case,
we
find
that
they
are
almost
identical
to
the
factors
used
in
analyzing
this
case
by
the
district
court
and
inferentially
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
simmons,
the
court’s
opinion
talks
about
the
necessity
for
a
prompt
photo
identification.
here,
there
was
absolutely
no
necessity
for
a
showup,
roughly
seven
months
after
the
crime
with
the
cooperative
witness.
in
simmons,
the
court
talks
about
the
initial
opportunity
to
observe
a
well-lighted
bank.
here,
we
have
a
dark
house,
woods
and
moonlight.
in
simmons,
the
court
talks
about
fresh
memories.
here,
we
have
a
stale
memory
and
a
stale
memory
in
part
at
least
of
a
voice.
in
simmons,
there
was
no
suggestion
whatsoever
by
the
fbi
agents
that
the
man
whose
photo
they
showed
along
with
other
photos
was
under
suspicion.
here,
the
police
described
biggers
to
the
prosecutrix
as
a
suspect
reinforcing
with
an
official
finger
of
what
the
showup
itself
did
which
was
to
point
that
the
respondent
as
a
person
who
the
police
thought
may
will
have
been
guilty.
and
finally,
in
simmons,
there
were
five
eyewitnesses
who
all
identified
the
defendant.
here
the
only
other
witness
to
the
crime
did
not
and
the
only
evidence
of
guilt
was
the
identification
which
we
would
assert
is
tainted.
now,
four
years
ago,
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
if
i
was
merely
asking
the
court
to
rule
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
jury
in
this
case.
since
that
argument,
the
court
in
simmons
and
in
foster
has
clearly
indicated
that
the
procedures
employed
by
the
state
in
taking
identification
evidence
can
be
so
defective
as
to
bar
their
admission
as
a
matter
of
law.
this
is
the
principle
we
rely
upon
here
today
and
submit
it
was
properly
applied
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
michael
meltsner
page
18?
mr.
michael
meltsner
“she
did
not
finally
identify
the
defendant
until
after
a
voice
test.”
that
is
at
page
129
of
the
appendix
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
i
may
just
direct
myself
to
that
in
more
detail,
in
making
that
assertion
we
are
giving
the
state’s
arguments
as
much
weight
as
it
will
bear.
our
contention
is
--
and
the
district
court
did
not
resolve
this
conflict,
that
much
of
the
evidence
at
trial
suggested
that
she
identified
him
only
after
he
spoke.
she
said
so
herself
on
page
a-17,
in
a
statement
on
page
r-17
and
the
statement
by
a
police
officer
on
r-66
confirms
this
and
the
respondent
himself
said
that
she
did
not
identify
him
until
after
he
spoke.
four
years
later,
she
was
certain
that
she
had
identified
him
--
she
did
--
certain
that
she
identified
him
before
he
spoke
not
after
he
spoke.
but
i
then
asked
her,
“well
after
he
said,
'shut
up
or
i’ll
kill
you,'
were
you
more
certain
of
your
identification?”
and
she
said,
“yes.”
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct.
the
district
court
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
district
court
said
there
was
great
doubt
that
there
was
an
in-court
identification
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
appendix
at
--
before
the
district
court
should
testify
that
she
did
identify
him
four
years
earlier
at
trial,
all
the
record
of
the
trial
shows
is
that
she
was
asked,
“is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
today?”
and
she
said,
“no.
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
today.”
no,
that
is
not
the
way
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
because
i
think
--
because
identifying
someone
in
a
courtroom
is
a
question
of
kicking
them
out
from
the
group,
i
am
not
saying
that
there
is
no
doubt.
but
in
any
event,
this
case
must
be
reversed
because
the
--
almost
the
entire
state’s
case
was
the
out-of-court
identification
and
testimony
about
it,
not
the
in-court
identification.
and
foster
versus
california
is
a
decision
of
the
court
which
reverses
on
that
basis
even
though
there
was
an
in-court
identification.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
to
the
--
to
the
extent
that
they
indicate
that
the
process
of
direct
review
is
over,
i
suppose
they're
relevant.
but
i
think
the
--
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
anything
in
those
cases
or
anything
that
i
can
immediately
think
of
in
logic
that
would
alter
the
scope
of
the
writ
in
this
case.
and
in
anyway,
act
conclusively,
to
bar
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
that
sense,
it
did.
mr.
michael
meltsner
if
we
didn’t
have
a
statute?
mr.
michael
meltsner
my
--
that
brings
me
back
to
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
yesterday.
in
that
event,
i
think
a
district
judge
clearly
would
have
the
power
not
to
entertain
the
writ.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
the
real
meaning
of
statute
is
in
its
definition
of
when
in
that
instance,
one
can
still
go
back
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you.
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
far
from
accidental
that
with
respect
to
the
consequence
of
a
four-four
affirmance,
the
state
relies
on
the
statute
here.
it
goes
--
its
position
of
that
a
four-four
affirmance
would
bar
an
initial
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
claiming
a
denial
of
due
process,
fails
to
come
to
terms
with
several
principles
which
have
been
quite
prominent
in
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
area.
the
first
is
that
a
state
court’s
disposition
of
a
state
prisoner’s
federal
constitutional
question
is
not
a
conclusive
determination
of
that
question,
and
that
each
state
prisoner
will
at
least
have
one
opportunity
to
obtain
a
resolution
of
this
federal
constitutional
claim
in
a
federal
forum.
when
this
court
affirms
by
an
equal
division,
it
merely
leaves
standing
a
state
court
determination
of
federal
question,
whatever
it
is.
indeed
one
can
imagine
quite
easily
the
court
affirming
by
an
equal
division
to
totally
inconsistent
lower
court
decisions.
yet,
the
position
taken
by
the
state
here
would
convert
this
state
court
disposition
of
a
federal
constitutional
question
into
an
absolute
bar
that
will
be
habeas
corpus.
mr.
michael
meltsner
right.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
difference
is
that
in
this
situation
congress
has
decided
to
make
federal
habeas
corpus
available
to
the
petitioner
for
collateral
attack.
mr.
michael
meltsner
actually
decided.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
which
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
only
difference
would
be
that
again,
if
i
understand
your
question
that
in
the
latter
situation,
suppose
this
court
would
have
four-four
affirmed
this
case
at
this
point
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
it
was
here
on
direct
review.
mr.
michael
meltsner
a
direct
review.
mr.
michael
meltsner
but
if
this
court
were
to
four-four
affirm
now
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
--
at
least
there
would
be
a
federal
court’s
determination
of
the
federal
question
standing.
and
one
of
the
statutes
involved
in
the
case,
2109,
of
the
judicial
code
makes
quite
clear
that
in
congress’
contemplation
at
least,
the
highest
court
that
can
determine
this
question
ought
to
determine
it
where
this
court
is
disabled,
because
of
a
four-four
split
from
hearing
it.
the
second
principle
though
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
from
deciding
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
from
deciding
it.
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
what
a
four-four
affirmance
is,
is
what
a
technical
rule
of
judicial
administration,
it’s
an
action
out
of
necessity,
it’s
something
that
the
court
does
because
it
cannot
do
anything
else.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it’s
close
to
it
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
--
in
the
first
case
that
the
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes.
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
on
question
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
question
here
and
the
court
has
made
its
decision
by
a
majority
in
that
case.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
using
the
label
res
judicata
is
somewhat
misleading.
even
in
sanders
versus
the
united
states,
the
court
said,
“there
were
some
principles
of
finality
which
govern
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.”
but
they
were
to
be
employed
by
use
of
equitable
principles.
and
sanders
sets
forth
situation
where
let's
say,
abuse
of
the
writ
is
involved,
where
a
federal
district
court
can
say,
“no,
i
am
not
going
to
determine
this
question.”
of
course,
another
court
has
heard
and
decided.
now,
whether
it's
called
res
judicata
or
stare
decisis
or
a
principle
of
finality,
i
don’t
think
there's
a
district
judge
inland
who
would
re-litigate
a
question
which
was
fully
considered
by
this
court
,and
decided
by
this
court
unless
they
were
either
a
change
in
law
or
new
factual
--
material
factual
matter
that
was
presented,
which
made
the
federal
constitutional
question
a
different
one,
in
kind,
from
the
one
this
court
decided.
now,
i
do
not
believe
that
res
judicata
or
any
principle
of
finality
would
jurisdictionally
bar
a
federal
district
court
from
considering
a
habeas
petition
in
that
circumstance.
but
absent
those
circumstances,
it’s
plain
to
me
that
there
would
be
no
--
there
would
be
no
--
there
will
be
no
equity
in
the
petition,
and
that
it
would
not
be
heard.
now,
it's
interesting
that
the
statute
which
the
state
here
relies
on
heavily
in
light
of
the
principle
i
mentioned,
and
also
in
light
of
the
general
principle
that
technical
adjudication
is
used,
short
of
the
merits
are
not
sufficient
to
bar
federal
habeas
corpus.
the
procedural
rules
emanating
from
the
process
of
direct
review
do
not
bar
federal
habeas
corpus,
unless
they
amount
to
a
deliberate
bypass
or
an
actual
determination
of
federal
question,
the
state
comes
to
the
statute.
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
congress
sought
to
deal
with
this
problem,
and
it's
this
deal
in
my
judgment
that
suggests
the
contrary.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes,
the
judgment
of
the
--
my
understanding
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
is
affirmed
in
the
same
way
that
the
process
of
direct
review
is
ended
when
this
court
denied
cert.
mr.
michael
meltsner
actually
adjudicated
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
i
think
what
is
clearly
intended
is
that
there
is
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
question.
and
the
statute
would
make
little
sense
if
that
language
was
not
read
that
way,
because
in
a
statute
after
stating
that
an
actual
adjudication
will
bar
subsequent
relief
by
habeas
corpus,
the
statute
goes
on
to
define
that
situation
where
a
new
material
of
fact
has
been
alleged,
and
it
was
not
avoided
in
the
past
because
of
lack
of
due
diligence,
and
describes
that
in
that
situation
federal
habeas
corpus
will,
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
if
it
said
a
judgment,
we
would
have
it
at
least,
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
we’d
have
a
somewhat
different
case,
because
there's
no
explanation
for
the
use
of
the
word
actual
in
this
statute,
unless
congress
meant
something
more
than
technical
affirmance
of
the
sort
we’re
dealing
with
here.
now
congress
has
passed
in
2109
of
the
judicial
code,
a
statute
which
expressly
equates
the
lack
of
a
forum
by
this
court
with
a
four-four
affirmance.
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
congress
sought
to
change
its
understanding
of
what
a
four-four
affirmance
meant.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
--
clearly
what
the
draftsmen
of
the
statute
had
in
mind.
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes,
of
course.
mr.
michael
meltsner
of
course
there
is.
and
a
denial
of
certiorari
as
i’ve
indicated
has
no
precedential
value.
it
ends
the
process
of
direct
review,
and
it
does
not
bar
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
this
time.
and
i
think
the
functional
effect
of
a
four-four
affirmance
is
and
ought
to
be
the
same.
additionally,
the
legislative
history
can
be
as
it
is,
suggests
that
the
problem
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
was
abuse
of
the
writ,
was
re-litigation
of
it
--
of
questions
that
had
actually
been
decided.
there's
nothing
of
that
sort
here.
cases
arising
at
a
four-four
affirmances
are
hardly
flooding
the
federal
courts.
and
additionally,
i’d
simply
want
to
point
out
that
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
an
intent
to
modify
the
interests
of
justice
standard
which
has
long
been
attached
to
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
and
the
district
judge
in
this
very
case
deciding
why
would
this
determine
the
due
process
issue,
indicated
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
do
so.
in
other
words,
both
the
language,
the
policy,
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
failed
to
suggest
that
congress
had
any
intention
to
change
what
had
generally
been
understood
to
be
the
meaning
of
a
four-four
affirmance,
a
technical
sort
of
response
which
is
simply
a
way
of
disposing
of
the
case
that
this
court
could
not
decide.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
by
definite
--
that
question
has
long
troubled
me
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you.
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
remaining,
i
would
like
to
discuss
petitioner’s
challenge
to
the
factual
findings
made
by
the
district
court
with
respect
to
the
due
process
issue.
findings
which
were
affirmed
by
the
entire
court
of
appeals
below,
that
court
dividing
solely
over
the
question
of
the
consequence
of
the
prior
four
to
four
affirmance
in
this
case.
but
first,
i
would
like
to
reply
briefly
to
a
question
asked
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
which
i
had
either
misheard
or
misunderstood.
justice
rehnquist
asked
me
whether
if
this
court
had
in
this
case
previously
decided
seven
to
two
or
nine
to
nothing
against
the
respondent’s
claim
or
whether
res
judicata
would
in
that
event
had
barred
a
subsequent
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
and
i
answered
yes,
but
i
don’t
think
i
gave
a
sufficiently
distinct
answer.
i
think,
the
answer
is
plainly
with
the
statute
involved
in
this
case,
2244
(c)
would
in
that
event
bar
re-litigation
and
that
is
indeed
the
very
situation,
a
very
abuse
of
the
writ
which
congress
was
addressing
itself
to
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes,
i
was.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct.
i
was
answering
you
in
terms
of
the
sanders'
opinion,
which
was,
of
course,
the
backdrop
against
which
2244
(c)
was
drafted.
now,
as
i
read
the
petitioner’s
brief
here
and
understand
its
argument
yesterday,
the
state
does
not
seriously
contend
that
the
district
court
define
the
standard
of
law
which
it
had
applied
in
this
case
incorrectly.
what
the
district
court
did,
was
treat
the
showup
as
a
suggestive
and
potentially
dangerous
identification
device,
but
not
one
which
was
per
se
unconstitutional.
it
waived
the
showup
and
aggravating
circumstances
in
this
case
against
its
necessity
in
this
case
and
external
indicia
of
reliability,
whether
there
was
anything
which
justified
the
use
of
the
showup.
and
i
think
this
conforms
to
what
the
court
in
curvy
last
term
called
weighing
the
prejudice
to
a
defendant
against
society’s
interest
in
law
enforcement
and
it
conforms
almost
identically
to
the
analytic
process
which
the
court
itself
used
in
simmons
versus
the
united
states
several
terms
ago
nor
do
--
as
i
understand
the
state’s
argument
yesterday
and
its
brief,
nor
does
the
state
seriously
challenge
the
application
of
this
standard
to
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court
and
i
will
have
hopefully
something
to
say
about
that
later.
the
state
concentrates
its
attack
here
on
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
and
as
this
court
generally
does
not
reverse
findings
of
historical
fact,
it
seems
to
me
quite
plain
that
the
state
has
a
very
heavy
burden
to
carry.
mr.
michael
meltsner
correct
mr.
chief
justice
and
my
--
a
good
deal
of
what
i
hope
to
say
is
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
and
then
that
--
the
question
of
support
for
the
district
court’s
findings
of
fact
is
what
i
intend
to
turn
to
now.
a
preliminary
matter,
however,
as
i
understood
mr.
durham
yesterday,
he
said
or
implied
that
the
district
court’s
findings
were
based
on
a
cold
record.
they
were
based
on
the
record
made
on
direct
review.
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
district
court
heard
testimony
from
two
police
officers,
including
the
police
officer
who
is
in-charge
of
the
investigation
of
this
case.
he
heard
testimony
from
the
prosecutors.
he
heard
testimony
from
respondent’s
mother
and
he
heard
expert
testimony
directed
to
the
procedures
used
in
this
case.
the
testimony
--
it
appears
in
the
appendix
from
pages
66
to
134.
it
amplified
the
record
made
on
direct
review,
but
it
did
more
than
that.
it
supplied
the
answers
to
many
questions
which
this
court
asked
me
in
1968
and
i
think
that’s
apparent
from
a
reading
of
that
section
of
the
appendix.
for
example,
the
officer
who
was
in-charge
of
the
investigation,
captain
mcdaniel,
testified
to
the
efforts
he
used
to
put
together
a
lineup
in
the
four
or
so
hours
that
he
tried
to
do
that.
district
court,
after
hearing
his
testimony
which
was
directed
to
showing
that
he
could
not
put
a
lineup
together,
rejected
it.
the
testimony
before
the
district
judge
dealt
with
the
initial
description
given
by
the
prosecutrix
to
the
police
shortly
after
the
crime.
that
appears
on
page
a-74.
it
deals
with
the
question
of
voice
identification
where
the
prosecutrix
according
to
the
district
judge,
and
as
i
will
indicate
later,
or
i
hope
to
show
later,
there
was
a
conflict
between
what
she
had
testified
to
at
trial
and
testified
to
before
the
district
court.
finally,
the
expert
witness
gave
us
opinion
of
the
procedures
used
in
this
case
and
clearly
indicated
that
even
an
imperfect
lineup,
one
where
every
trait
of
the
person
who
was
to
be
seen
by
the
witness
was
not
identical,
was
thought
preferable
in
a
showup.
the
district
court
relied
on
a
good
deal
of
this
evidence
and
that
appears
on
pages
a-41
and
a-42
of
the
record.
so
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
district
court
here
was
not
of
hearing
oral
testimony
in
weighing
credibility.
now,
before
again
talking
about
the
factual
findings
that
the
state
challenges,
i
think,
i
have
to
put
it
in
perspective
by
indicating
simply
what
the
state
does
not
challenge.
the
state
does
not
challenge
most
of
the
factual
conclusions
reached
by
the
district
court.
the
state
does
not
dispute
that
the
evidence
of
the
showup
identification
was
admitted
at
trial
that
the
showup
took
place
between
six
and
seven
months
after
the
crime
that
the
police
described
respondent
to
the
prosecutrix
as
a
suspect
before
the
identification,
that
the
respondent
was
alone
made
to
speak
inflammatory
words
which
was
spoken
by
the
assailant
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
“shut
up
or
i’ll
kill
you”
and
that
the
prosecutrix
relied
to
some
extent
on
this
voice
identification.
he
testified
before
the
district
court
that
she
identified
him
first
before
he
spoke.
but
even
she
conceded
that
her
identification
was
made
more
certain
by
what
he
said.
at
trial,
of
course,
she
said,
in
the
state
court,
she
said
that
the
first
thing
that
made
her
identify
respondent
was
his
voice,
and
this
appears
on
page
17
of
the
record
which
was
before
this
court
in
1968.
it
is
also
undisputed
that
there
was
no
other
evidence
of
guilt
and
identification
evidence
that
the
only
other
eyewitness
to
the
events
could
not
identify
the
respondent
and
that
there
was
no
independent
photo
identification
in
this
case.
so
we
come
to
the
particular
matters
the
state
has
concentrated
its
fire
at.
and
as
i
read
the
brief
and
understand
the
argument,
they
are
basically
three.
one;
whether
a
truly
concerted
effort
was
made
to
hold
the
lineup
in
this
case;
secondly,
the
quality
of
the
initial
description
given
by
the
prosecutrix
to
the
police
shortly
after
the
crime,
and
finally,
the
opportunity
to
observe
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
and
it
is
my
submission
that
in
each
of
these
instances,
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
so
that
no
appellate
tribunal
can
say
that
the
district
court
--
district
court’s
findings
as
to
these
matters
was
clearly
erroneous.
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
holding
in
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
truly
concerted
effort
to
hold
the
lineup
in
this
case
and
no
need
for
speed,
the
record
shows
that
what
this
police
officer
did
over
the
course
of
a
morning
in
trying
to
rind
--
round
up
a
lineup
was
to
check
one
jail
facility
and
phone
another,
but
not
to
go
to
visit.
he
did
not
try
several
other
penal
institutions
that
were
located
in
the
nashville
area,
including
the
state
penitentiary
and
that
there
was
absolutely
no
need
for
speed
in
this
case.
the
crime
was
seven
months
old
and
the
complaining
witness
had
been
perfectly
cooperative
in
the
past
with
the
police.
the
district
court
had
a
good
deal
of
knowledge
about
local
conditions.
he
heard
the
police
officer
testify
in
explanation
of
why
he
did
not
put
together
a
lineup
and
concluded
that
there
was
no
need
for
such
a
prompt
showup
in
this
case.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
initial
opportunity
to
observe
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
district
court
held,
and
this
appears
on
a-41
of
the
appendix
that
the
prosecutrix
clearly
did
not
have
a
good
opportunity.
well,
she,
in
fact,
testified
that
she
saw
the
rapist,
but
the
objective
circumstances
certainly
support
the
district
court’s
conclusion.
she
was
grabbed
from
behind
in
an
unlit
hallway,
marched
out
through
an
unlit
kitchen,
up
on
some
railroad
tracks
where
there
was
some
light
from
the
moon
and
some
overhead
lights
from
the
nearby
street,
but
she
marched
along
these
railroad
tracks
at
the
point
of
a
knife.
and
she
was
marched
along
those
tracks
for
a
block
or
two
and
then
pushed
into
some
overgrowth
where
the
crime
was
--
where
the
crime
took
place
and
then
the
assailant
fled.
now,
given
those
circumstances,
and
the
prosecutrix’s
admission
before
the
district
court
on
page
a-125
that
the
lighting
in
her
house
was
dim,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
a
matter
where
this
court
can
possibly
substitute
its
judgment
as
to
the
opportunity
to
view
the
assailant
for
the
district
courts.
the
third
issue
has
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
initial
description
given
to
the
police
at
the
time
of
the
crime
by
the
woman
who
had
been
raped.
and
here,
the
evidence
before
the
district
court
is
quite
clear,
although
at
the
time
of
trial,
mrs.
beamer,
the
woman
who’d
been
raped,
listed
a
number
of
traits.
she
described
them
as
the
traits
which
led
her
to
identify
the
man
which
she
identified,
the
respondent,
at
the
time
of
the
pretrial
identification.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
which
told
us
what
sort
of
a
description
she’d
given
seven
months
earlier
to
the
police.
well,
before
the
district
court
on
page
a-74,
captain
mcdaniel,
the
chief
officer
involved
in
the
case
was
asked
about
this
specifically
and
he
testified
referring
to
his
notes,
“alright,
sir,
says,
his
height
was
six
feet
tall,
180
pounds,
he
was
dark
hair,
medium
or
medium
to
dark
complexion.”
that
was
the
description
given
by
the
prosecutrix
to
the
police
according
to
this
officer’s
notes.
now
in
light
of
that,
again
it
seems
to
me
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
district
court’s
holding
that
the
initial
description
was
general
can
anyway
be
off
set
as
clearly
erroneous.
that
brings
me
to
a
last
issue
which
is
merely
the
application
of
a
standard
which
i
take
not
to
be
seriously
disputed
to
facts
which
i
do
not
think
this
court
properly
sets
aside
and,
i
think,
any
examination
of
what
lower
courts
have
done
with
stovall
and
any
examination
of
the
decision
of
this
court
which
goes
into
application
of
stovall
in
most
detail
that
being
simmons
will
demonstrate
that
the
district
court
properly
applied
the
standard
to
the
facts.
i
think,
looking
at
simmons
is
quite
constructive.
in
that
case,
the
identification
procedure
which
was
a
photo
identification
was
upheld,
but
looking
at
the
factors
used
in
justice
harlan’s
analysis
in
that
case,
we
find
that
they
are
almost
identical
to
the
factors
used
in
analyzing
this
case
by
the
district
court
and
inferentially
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
simmons,
the
court’s
opinion
talks
about
the
necessity
for
a
prompt
photo
identification.
here,
there
was
absolutely
no
necessity
for
a
showup,
roughly
seven
months
after
the
crime
with
the
cooperative
witness.
in
simmons,
the
court
talks
about
the
initial
opportunity
to
observe
a
well-lighted
bank.
here,
we
have
a
dark
house,
woods
and
moonlight.
in
simmons,
the
court
talks
about
fresh
memories.
here,
we
have
a
stale
memory
and
a
stale
memory
in
part
at
least
of
a
voice.
in
simmons,
there
was
no
suggestion
whatsoever
by
the
fbi
agents
that
the
man
whose
photo
they
showed
along
with
other
photos
was
under
suspicion.
here,
the
police
described
biggers
to
the
prosecutrix
as
a
suspect
reinforcing
with
an
official
finger
of
what
the
showup
itself
did
which
was
to
point
that
the
respondent
as
a
person
who
the
police
thought
may
will
have
been
guilty.
and
finally,
in
simmons,
there
were
five
eyewitnesses
who
all
identified
the
defendant.
here
the
only
other
witness
to
the
crime
did
not
and
the
only
evidence
of
guilt
was
the
identification
which
we
would
assert
is
tainted.
now,
four
years
ago,
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
if
i
was
merely
asking
the
court
to
rule
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
jury
in
this
case.
since
that
argument,
the
court
in
simmons
and
in
foster
has
clearly
indicated
that
the
procedures
employed
by
the
state
in
taking
identification
evidence
can
be
so
defective
as
to
bar
their
admission
as
a
matter
of
law.
this
is
the
principle
we
rely
upon
here
today
and
submit
it
was
properly
applied
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
michael
meltsner
page
18?
mr.
michael
meltsner
“she
did
not
finally
identify
the
defendant
until
after
a
voice
test.”
that
is
at
page
129
of
the
appendix
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
i
may
just
direct
myself
to
that
in
more
detail,
in
making
that
assertion
we
are
giving
the
state’s
arguments
as
much
weight
as
it
will
bear.
our
contention
is
--
and
the
district
court
did
not
resolve
this
conflict,
that
much
of
the
evidence
at
trial
suggested
that
she
identified
him
only
after
he
spoke.
she
said
so
herself
on
page
a-17,
in
a
statement
on
page
r-17
and
the
statement
by
a
police
officer
on
r-66
confirms
this
and
the
respondent
himself
said
that
she
did
not
identify
him
until
after
he
spoke.
four
years
later,
she
was
certain
that
she
had
identified
him
--
she
did
--
certain
that
she
identified
him
before
he
spoke
not
after
he
spoke.
but
i
then
asked
her,
“well
after
he
said,
'shut
up
or
i’ll
kill
you,'
were
you
more
certain
of
your
identification?”
and
she
said,
“yes.”
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct.
the
district
court
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
district
court
said
there
was
great
doubt
that
there
was
an
in-court
identification
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
appendix
at
--
before
the
district
court
should
testify
that
she
did
identify
him
four
years
earlier
at
trial,
all
the
record
of
the
trial
shows
is
that
she
was
asked,
“is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
today?”
and
she
said,
“no.
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
today.”
no,
that
is
not
the
way
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
because
i
think
--
because
identifying
someone
in
a
courtroom
is
a
question
of
kicking
them
out
from
the
group,
i
am
not
saying
that
there
is
no
doubt.
but
in
any
event,
this
case
must
be
reversed
because
the
--
almost
the
entire
state’s
case
was
the
out-of-court
identification
and
testimony
about
it,
not
the
in-court
identification.
and
foster
versus
california
is
a
decision
of
the
court
which
reverses
on
that
basis
even
though
there
was
an
in-court
identification.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
to
the
--
to
the
extent
that
they
indicate
that
the
process
of
direct
review
is
over,
i
suppose
they're
relevant.
but
i
think
the
--
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
anything
in
those
cases
or
anything
that
i
can
immediately
think
of
in
logic
that
would
alter
the
scope
of
the
writ
in
this
case.
and
in
anyway,
act
conclusively,
to
bar
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
that
sense,
it
did.
mr.
michael
meltsner
if
we
didn’t
have
a
statute?
mr.
michael
meltsner
my
--
that
brings
me
back
to
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
yesterday.
in
that
event,
i
think
a
district
judge
clearly
would
have
the
power
not
to
entertain
the
writ.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
the
real
meaning
of
statute
is
in
its
definition
of
when
in
that
instance,
one
can
still
go
back
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you.
