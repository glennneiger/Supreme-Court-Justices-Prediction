justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
durham,
i
gather
you
have
to
argue
the
significance
of
what
actually
the
court
adjudicated,
don’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
really,
i
suppose
under
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
a
four-four,
is
that
disposition
actually
adjudicated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
you
--
you
know,
at
least
i
have
been
able
to
find
much
help
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
your
argument.
do
you
find
any?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
there
was
the
difference.
as
i
recall
it
in
stovall,
the
victim
was
an
extreme,
they
didn’t
think
she
was
going
to
survive
the
night.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
that
wasn't
the
case
here,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
the
victim,
as
i
remember
the
facts,
viewed
the
young
man
at
the
police
station
many,
many
months,
was
that
after
the
actual
crime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
no
problem
about
her
health
or
anything
else,
suggested
then
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
the
situation
be
any
different
mr.
meltsner
if
suppose
where
a
grant
here
asserted
on
direct
review
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
state
court
decision,
and
we
divided
four-four
to
affirm
the
conviction
brought
here
by
the
state
prison.
is
there
this
difference
in
that
situation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
to
the
availability
of
federal
habeas
from
the
situation
we
have
here,
which
is
a
four-four
affirmance
act
or
grant
of
cert
--
to
a
--
and
a
federal
habeas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
(inaudible)
where
this
court
has
actually
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assuming
this
statute,
this
statute
would
apply
i
take
it,
whether
or
not
require
a
determination
to
whether
there
was
some
actual
adjudication.
whether
or
not
our
four-four
division
was
on
direct
review
of
the
state
conviction,
or
was
a
four-four
division
on
a
one
federal
habeas
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
–
what
it
will
be
four
on
habeas,
was
it
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
was
it
direct
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
okay.(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.
justice
william

the

that
it
requires
the
four-four
affirmance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
said
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
actually,
there
is

there
is
some
legislative
history
supporting
that
mr.
meltsner.(voice

yes,
you
know.

would
the

had
been

different
on
the
seven

two
affirmance
if
we
never
had
a
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
so
it
has
a
presidential
[attempt

has
presidential
value.
so
in
that
sense,
the
statute
adds
nothing
to
the
situation
as
regards
the
impact
of
an
affirmance
here,
nine
to
nothing
or
seven
to
two--
justice
william

brennan,

that
disposes
adversely
to

state
