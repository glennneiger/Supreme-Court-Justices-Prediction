justice
potter
stewart
you
said
it
was
true
in
ordinary
litigation,
in
the
absence
of
the
statute,
you’d
be
faced
with
a
proposition,
wouldn’t
you,
that
there
is
no
res
judicata
in
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
say,
absent
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whatever
the
reason,
it's
well
settled
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
tell
me
if
i’m
wrong
that
ordinary
concepts
of
res
judicata
are
simply
inapplicable
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
the
reason
as
i
understand
that
you’re
relying
so
heavily
on
this
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
absence
of
new
client?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
between
the
same
parties?
justice
potter
stewart
and
even
though
the
same
constitutional
provision
is
invoked?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
--
as
at
the
trial
--
at
the
original
trial
in
the
state
court?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
basic
point
as
i
understood
it
that
your
brother
was
making
was
that
all
his
testimony
went
to
the
circumstances
under
which
she
identified
him
at
the
lineup
prior
to,
he
is
talking
about
the
showup,
prior
to
the
trial
and
that
she
did
not
identify
him
at
the
trial
independently.
i
think,
that
was
the
basic
point
your
brother
was
making,
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you
disagree
that’s
the
point
he
was
making?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
he
said
that.
but
i
thought

i
understood
his--

basic
point

be
that
there
was
not
an
independent
identification
in
the
courtroom
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
all
of
this
testimony
went
to
the
identification
prior
to
the
trial
at
the
--
during
the
procedures
that
he
says
were
constitutionally
invalid.
