justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
durham,
supposing
in
this
case
instead
of
the
four-four
affirmance
there
had
been
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
a
moment
ago,
an
affirmance
on
the
merits
by
nine
to
nothing,
eight
to
one,
some
rather
lopsided
majority.
what
is
your
opinion
as
to
whether
a
federal
habeas
on
these
same
issues
would
then
lie
in
the
district
court
for
this
particular
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
then
in
effect
that
although
as
between
lower
court
decisions,
there
may
be
no
res
judicata
in
federal
habeas,
if
this
court
has
once
affirmed
on
the
merits,
that
ends
not
only
the
direct
litigation,
but
further
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
meltsner,
do
you
feel
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
meltsner,
you
feel
then
that
the
four-four
affirmance
in
the
circumstances
that
was
here
below,
is
a
different
situation
than
say
at
seven
to
two
affirmance
with
an
opinion
on
the
merits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
habeas
--
if
habeas
corpus
isn’t
res
judicata,
why
should
a
decision
on
the
merits
by
this
court
foreclose
a
potential
habeas
petitioner
any
more
than
a
decision
of
a
lower
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
couldn’t
it
have
been
suggesting
perhaps
that
a
denial
of
certiorari
was
not
an
actual
adjudication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
addressing
yourself
yet,
i
suppose
to
the
situation
before
the
statute
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
where
you
said
the
bill
would
have
no
equity
but
it’s
not
technically
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
meltsner,
going
back
to
the
relevance
of
this
court’s
earlier
action
for
a
moment,
would
you
agree
that
in
view
of
the
statute,
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
united
states
against
pink
and
the
durham
case
which
makes
some
comment
on
the
effect
of
four
to
four
affirmance
in
non-habeas
corpus
situations
are
perhaps
relevant
in
construing
the
meaning
that
congress
intended
to
use
when
it
said
actually
adjudicate
even
though
they
--
those
cases
didn’t
deal
with
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
you’ve
conceded
in
effect
that
the
statute
has
changed
the
situation
at
least
after
a
seven
to
two
affirmance
by
this
court,
so
the
statute
did
alter
the
scope
of
the
writ
in
that
sense.
