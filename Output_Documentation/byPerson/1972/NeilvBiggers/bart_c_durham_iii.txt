mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
is
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
in
which
two
questions
are
raised.
the
first
one
is,
in
respect
to
a
case
that
was
here
before
and
affirmed
four-four
by
this
honorable
court.
the
second
one
is;
the
stovall
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
defendant
had
a
fair
pretrial
confrontation.
in
order
to
give
your
honors
a
background,
i'll
state
the
chronology
of
the
case,
it
was
here
in
1967
and
’68.
the
crime
occurred
in
january
of
1965.
the
defendant
was
identified
at
the
police
station
in
that
year,
and
his
subsequent
trial
and
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
march
of
1967.
this
court
granted
certiorari,
and
the
case
was
argued
before
this
court
in
january
of
1968.
mr.
justice
marshall
recused
himself,
and
the
court
after
hearing
plenary
arguments,
affirmed
at
the
tennessee
supreme
court
which
had
affirmed
the
rape
conviction
by
a
vote
of
four-four.
there
was
no
written
opinion
from
the
court,
but
mr.
justice
douglas
recorded
the
reasons
for
his
dissent
as
one
the
four
dissenters.
shortly
after
the
case
was
affirmed
in
march
of
’68,
this
defendant
went
right
back
into
the
federal
court
system
by
filing
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
seeking
to
re-litigate
what
the
state
contends
as
--
was
the
same
issue
before
the
federal
district
judge
in
nashville.
a
plenary
–
a
limited
evidentiary
hearing
was
held,
and
the
court
found
that
the
pretrial
confrontation
was
violative
of
this
court’s
principle
in
stovall,
and
ordered
a
new
trial
unaffected
by
the
valid
identification.
the
state
took
in
an
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
from
the
united
states
district
judge
opinion,
honorable
william
e.
miller,
who
is
now
a
member
of
the
sixth
circuit
and,
the
sixth
circuit
by
two
to
one
division,
judges
mcrae,
and
brook,
and
edwards,
in
the
majority
with
a
lengthy
dissent
by
(inaudible)
to
judge
brooks.
that
court
affirmed
the
district
court
from
whence
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
so
the
two
questions
are;
what
is
the
effect
of
a
four-four
affirmance
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
and
did
the
defendant
have
a
prior
pretrial
identification?
with
respect
to
the
first
question,
we
think
the
law
was
quite
clear
and
possibly
conceded
by,
adversaries
it
says,
that
with
respect
to
any
other
case
except
the
habeas
corpus
case,
a
four-four
affirmance
ends
the
case,
as
between
the
parties,
and
as
to
that
matter.
some
distinction
has
been
made
by
the
federal
district
court,
because
this
is
not
an
ordinary
civil
case,
it
involves
human
liberties,
and
we
think
of
the
higher
position
in
our
jurisprudence
which
habeas
corpus
hold.
but,
we
say
that
historically
and
traditionally,
there
has
to
be
an
end
to
litigation,
and
that
it
should
have
ended
this
case.
but
our
primary
contention
with
respect
to
this,
is
an
act
of
congress,
28
u.s.c.
title
2244
(c).
that
statute
provides
and
that’s
what
we’re
relying
on
here,
it
is
found
at
page
3
of
my
brief,
that
that
statute
was
drawn
specifically
to
provide
for
finality
of
determination.
when
a
case
has
been
to
this
court
and
been
--
a
judgment
of
this
court,
it
says,
“shall
be
conclusive
as
to
all
issues
which
were
before
this
court.”
and
we
cite
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
as
well
as
commentary
in
the
harvard
law
review
and
others,
in
which
we
feel
it’s
clear
that
judge
oren
harris
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
his
letter
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
that’s
right,
your
honor.
that’s
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
beg
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
think
--
no
sir,
i
don’t
find
anything
particular
--
exactly
other
than
that
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
we
think
that
it
ends
the
case
between
the
parties
as
to
that
issue.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
as
to
that
issue.
if
that
be
the
law,
then
our
arguments
won.
but
does
it
–
we
cited
it
ends
the
case
between
the
parties
as
to
that
issue.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
there
is
no
res
judicata
in
habeas
corpus,
except
congress
has
said
that
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
oh,
excuse
me,
that's
different.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
that's
because
it's
common
law,
there
was
no
appeal
in
habeas
--
in
the
habeas
corpus.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
and
the
reason
i
suppose
i
think
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
and
i’m
going
behind
that
explaining
the
reason
that
--
if
that
law
is
it
--
but
there
is
no
res
judicata
was
because
there
was
no
appeal.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
well,
my
opinion
your
honor
is
that
the
district
judge
would
recognize
this
court’s
case
law,
and
would've
found
--
would
have
refused
to
entertain
the
case,
as
well
as
it's
controlled
by
the
same
statute.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
we
think
that
the
case
law
is
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
there
can
be
a
new
like
the
burton
rule
or
something
might
come
up
which
your
honors
suggest
on
the
case
law
makes
those
changes.
now,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
“the
legislative
was
history
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
and
hidden
much
as
in
--
exactly
clear.”
but
we
did
feel,
that
what
little
there
is,
does
support
our
position.
however,
we
are
not
--
by
succeeding
doing
nothing
more
in
my
oral
argument
today,
i
do
want
to
stress
the
second
point
of
our
contention,
and
that
is
on
the
facts,
the
district
judge
grievously
erred
in
finding
that
there
was
a
bad
confrontation.
the
--
ordinarily,
i’m
aware
this
court
wouldn’t
want
to
go
into
the
facts,
where
the
district
court
has
found
facts,
and
appellate
court
has
affirmed
it,
and
i’m
asking
your
honors
to
look
again
at
the
facts.
but
the
point
is
that
the
district
judge
didn’t
hear
any
new
facts
and
he
didn’t
weigh
the
credibility
of
evidence.
we
say
that
he
made
seven
grievous
sins.
we
cite
five
of
those
at
page
34
of
our
brief,
and
in
addition
of
those
five,
earlier
we
mentioned
the
error
that
the
district
judge
made
when
he
said
that
the
victim
changed
her
story,
and
between
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
and
that
the
police
officer
changed
his
story
between
the
time
of
the
trial
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
and
that
just
isn’t
simply
so.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
lineup
was
held.
there
were
only
three
people
who
testified
about
the
lineup
and
i’m
talking
about
the
original
trial
record
now.
those
policemen
were
detective
smith,
lieutenant
daniel
and
detective
bailey.
detective
smith
at
page
40
of
the
record,
and
detective
bailey
at
page
48
of
the
record,
said
that
this
victim
identified
the
man
before
she
heard
him
speak.
and
that
she
thereafter
asked
him
to
speak
merely
to
confirm
her
identification.
i
say
in
this,
and
i
make
an
analogy
in
my
brief
as
one
of
the
judges
in
the
lower
court
did
in
stovall,
what
would
be
the
argument
had
that
lady
in
stovall
case
died,
and
they
not
taking
the
man
over
there
to
view
mrs.
barrett,
the
victim
in
that
case.
so,
they
brought
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
the
trial
counsel
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided,
no
american
court
that
i’m
aware
of
had
ever
held
that
the
identification
was
anything
other
than
a
question
of
weight
and
not
admissibility.
the
weight
even
lower
court
cases
were
to
come
later.
this
was
in
january
--
august
of
1965.
so
the
state
believes
that
the
record
is
un-contradicted,
that
the
facts
were
that
she
identified
them
first,
all
the
parties
were
black,
the
defendant
was
in
the
company
of
two
black
officers,
she
made
--
the
victim
made
this
identification,
then
she
requested
that
he
speak.
even
the
victim
himself
in
his
affidavit
at
the
federal
habeas
hearing
doesn't
--
his
affidavit
we
cite
don't
contradict
it.
no,
the
third
officer
who
testified
about
the
lineup
was
the
supervising
officer,
lt.
mcdaniel.
and
it’s
unclear
from
his
trial
testimony,
whether
she
identified
him
first
or
heard
him
speak
first.
but
at
the
habeas
hearing,
he
--
his
memory
had
been
refreshed.
but
we
say,
it
wasn’t
the
point
at
the
trial
testimony,
who
cared?
nobody
asked
on
cross-examination,
nobody
brought
it
out,
whether
she
heard
him
speak
first
or
she
didn’t.
and
those
are
the
five
errors
as
i
say,
i’ve
listed
in
the
page,
beginning
at
page
34
of
my
brief
as
just
factual
errors
which
the
district
court,
just
made
an
error
on.
in
defense
of
the
district
judge,
let
me
say
that
i’m
the
fifth
or
sixth
attorney
who’s
handled
this
case
for
the
state,
and
when
the
habeas
petition
was
filed,
the
factual
aspects
were
shuffled
off
in
the
second
place,
because
the
state
felt
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
we
should
have
prevailed
based
on
my
first
argument.
so
these
facts
were
never
really
strenuously
argued
to
the
district
court,
but
they
are
un-contradicted
in
this
1965
transcript.
and
we
point
out
that
by
analogy
to
some
of
the
other
lineup
or
rather
one
on
one
confrontation
cases
which
this
court
has
made
that
we
believe
this
lineup
is
as
far
as
is
constitutionally
impermissible
than
others.
i
conclude.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i’ll
try
not
to
use
all
of
those
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
go
directly
to
the
court
--
about
the
dispute
–
the
factual
dispute
between
my
adversary
and
me
all
along.
we
seem
to
read
these
records
differently.
i
just
amended
to
a
go
mr.
meltsner
said
on
page
17
of
the
original
trial
record
which
unfortunately
your
honors
don’t
have,
there's
only
one
copy
in
the
supreme
court
library.
we
were
allowed
to
use
the
original
record
that
--
this
says
that
the
lady
was
identified
first
by
voice
and
i’m
reading
here
on
page
17,
“what
physical
characteristics,
if
any,
caused
you
to
be
able
to
identify
him?”
the
answer
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes.
counsel
referred
to
this
just
a
moment
ago
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
“first
of
all,
his
size;
next,
i
could
remember
his
voice.”
then
counsel
cited
your
honors
to
page
66
of
the
same
record
which
he
says
that
this
was
her
identification
of
him
first
by
his
voice,
was
confirmed
by
the
policeman,
at
that
particular
time
lt.
mcdaniel.
i’m
looking
at
page
66,
said
--
the
question
of
the
police
officer
was,
“and
when
did
that
take
place?”
right
at
that
time
when
she,
damn,
and
he
doesn’t
get
to
finish
that
word,
he
says,
“saw
him,
she
asked
us
to
have
him
repeat
the
question
which
he
repeated,
that,
and
she
also
by
voice.”
yes
sir,
well,
that’s
ambiguous,
as
i
point
on
my
brief.
the
three
offices
testified
about
the
identification
whether
or
not
it
was
voice
first
or
after,
didn’t
make
any
constitutional
difference
in
1965;
two,
he
said
she
identified
him
first
and
this
one
man
whose
testimony
is
so
ambiguous,
it
doesn’t
even
make
a
grammatical
sentence
in
the
english
language,
they
seize
on
certain
words
of
that,
at
this
page
66,
and
try
to
say
that
this
officer
said
that
she
identified
him
first
by
voice.
we
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
disagree
if
that
was
the
point.
i
understood
the
point
to
be
that
he’s
trying
to
show
that
this
was
a
weak
identification
and
the
voice
wasn’t
heard
as
a
mode
of
identification.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
also
--
i
understand
and
i
agree
with
you
your
honor
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
now,
my
colleague
says
that
the
--
i
have
said
that
the
district
court
made
findings
on
a
cold
record
and
he
disagrees
with
this.
what
i
am
saying,
and
i
want
this
to
be
clear,
is
that
take
the
cold
record
of
this
trial
in
1965
here
and
take
--
supplement
that
with
the
very
limited
evidentiary
hearing
in
which
the
two
police
officers
testified
adversely
to
mr.
meltsner’s
position
and
no
one
testified
that
i
know
of
to
his
position.
and
mrs.
beamer
testified
adversely
to
his
position,
but
just
doesn't
believe
them
entirely
and
just
go
on
the
cold
record.
in
other
words,
believe
all
of
his
witnesses
before
the
district
--
united
states’
district
judge,
disbelieved
all
of
my
witnesses
before
the
united
states’
district
judge
and
my
assertion
is
that
the
record
is
still
un-contradicted
as
to
(a)
the
lady
did
not
change
her
testimony
between
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
time
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
nor
did
the
police
officers.
the
point
being
that
they
--
the
constitutional
point
that
they
are
anxious
to
convey
is
that
it
puts
them
in
a
better
constitutional
posture
if
they
can
have
it
so
that
she
identified
him
first
by
voice
and
then
by
recognition
of
the
person
and
made
no
constitutional
difference
back
then
--
back
in
that
time.
so,
the
district
judge
found
that
the
police
officer
and
the
lady
changed
their
testimony.
now,
i’m
saying
that
that
is
un-contradicted
in
the
record
that
district
judge
errs
there.
now,
counsel
mentioned
the
finding
according
to
appendix
41
of
the
district
judge’s
order,
there's
no
indication
that
a
truly
concerted
effort
was
made
to
produce
suitable
subjects
for
a
lineup
aside
from
a
phone
call
to
the
juvenile
home
and
a
screening
of
metro
jail
inmates,
no
other
efforts
were
made.
all
the
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
went
into
that
and
the
district
judge,
we
say,
just
ignored
that.
now,
i
suppose,
you
would
have
to
not
disbelieve
that
or
perhaps
that
finding
would
stand.
their
only
testimonial
was
that
this
police
officer
said,
“i
consulted
with
a
juvenile
court
judge
and
his
superior
to
jail
and
it
wasn’t
possible
to
find
anyone
of
that
size.”
the
picture
of
mr.
biggers,
all
of
them
have
introduced
into
evidence
is
a
part
of
the
original
trial
record.
he’s
a
large
boy,
he
was
only
three
days
past
his
16th
birthday
but
he’s
a
giant,
sort
of
young
man,
and
the
state
argued
that
it
was
--
that
--
they
--
extremely
difficult
to
get
young
people
that
large
or
people
that
large
who
would
be
that
young.
he’s
--
he
stand
that
up
--
they’d
stand
that
in
--
either
because
of
their
age
or
because
of
their
size.
he’s
a
giant,
16-year-old,
whose
--
who
has
a
very
distinctive
appearance.
counsel
cited
you
to
a
statement
that
mrs.
--
that
the
victim,
mrs.
beamer
made,
cite
you
to
page
125
of
the
record
where
she
says
that
her
lighting
in
the
house
was
dim.
well,
if
you
want
to
just
go
through
this
thing
and
--
on
cross-examination
and
say
well,
was
your
light
kind
of
dim,
or
something
like
that,
you
can
find
that,
but
take
the
thing
as
a
whole.
take
the
testimony
as
a
whole,
in
many
other
places
and
at
the
trial,
she
said
that
it
was
--
the
house
was,
“well
lighted.”
and
then
went
into
that
in
some
degree.
we
think
that
the
argument
of
course
is
that
the
jury’s
verdict
has
to
a
great
degree
settled
that.
the
--
i
realize
we
do
have
a
burden
here
that
--
not
an
easy
one
to
overturn
factual
findings.
the
findings
were
as
counsel
stated
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
but
to
seek
--
they
would
--
were
done
out
of
hand
as
i’ve
argued
earlier,
first
reason,
the
state
didn’t
raise
much
of
an
issue
about
the
findings
of
the
fact
in
the
sixth
circuit.
we’ve
reserved
it
but
we
didn’t
go
--
i
wouldn’t
counsel
then.
frankly,
we
didn’t
argue
that
as
strenuously
as
we
did
the
legal
argument.
all
the
sixth
circuit
said
it
was,
we’re
not
able
to
say
that
this
was
clearly
erroneous.
we
are,
i
am
able
to
tell
your
honors
that
the
finding
of
the
district
judge
is
clearly
erroneous
in
seven
aspects,
and
i’ve
listed
them
in
my
brief.
counsel
has
analogized
biggers
to
stovall,
simmons
and
some
of
the
other
identification
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
and
i
frankly
believe
that
there's
little
profit
in
there.
i
think
that
the
--
and
counsel
said
that,
i
had
no
dispute
with
the
district
judge’s
interpretation
of
what
the
law
leads
and
that’s
probably
true.
i
think,
the
district
judge
just
as
every
judge
and
as
this
court
in
light
of
stovall
says,
“was
the
man
prejudiced
by
this
identification?
was
it
an
improper
identification?
was
it
unfair
that
basically
it’s
what
it
boils
down
to?”
if
it’s
unfair,
so
unfair
as
to
deny
him
a
fair
trial,
let’s
give
him
a
new
trial.
and
the
state
respectfully
contends
that
the
totality
of
the
testimony,
the
undisputed
testimony
that
he
did
get
a
fair
trial.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
is
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
in
which
two
questions
are
raised.
the
first
one
is,
in
respect
to
a
case
that
was
here
before
and
affirmed
four-four
by
this
honorable
court.
the
second
one
is;
the
stovall
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
defendant
had
a
fair
pretrial
confrontation.
in
order
to
give
your
honors
a
background,
i'll
state
the
chronology
of
the
case,
it
was
here
in
1967
and
’68.
the
crime
occurred
in
january
of
1965.
the
defendant
was
identified
at
the
police
station
in
that
year,
and
his
subsequent
trial
and
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
march
of
1967.
this
court
granted
certiorari,
and
the
case
was
argued
before
this
court
in
january
of
1968.
mr.
justice
marshall
recused
himself,
and
the
court
after
hearing
plenary
arguments,
affirmed
at
the
tennessee
supreme
court
which
had
affirmed
the
rape
conviction
by
a
vote
of
four-four.
there
was
no
written
opinion
from
the
court,
but
mr.
justice
douglas
recorded
the
reasons
for
his
dissent
as
one
the
four
dissenters.
shortly
after
the
case
was
affirmed
in
march
of
’68,
this
defendant
went
right
back
into
the
federal
court
system
by
filing
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
seeking
to
re-litigate
what
the
state
contends
as
--
was
the
same
issue
before
the
federal
district
judge
in
nashville.
a
plenary
–
a
limited
evidentiary
hearing
was
held,
and
the
court
found
that
the
pretrial
confrontation
was
violative
of
this
court’s
principle
in
stovall,
and
ordered
a
new
trial
unaffected
by
the
valid
identification.
the
state
took
in
an
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
from
the
united
states
district
judge
opinion,
honorable
william
e.
miller,
who
is
now
a
member
of
the
sixth
circuit
and,
the
sixth
circuit
by
two
to
one
division,
judges
mcrae,
and
brook,
and
edwards,
in
the
majority
with
a
lengthy
dissent
by
(inaudible)
to
judge
brooks.
that
court
affirmed
the
district
court
from
whence
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
so
the
two
questions
are;
what
is
the
effect
of
a
four-four
affirmance
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
and
did
the
defendant
have
a
prior
pretrial
identification?
with
respect
to
the
first
question,
we
think
the
law
was
quite
clear
and
possibly
conceded
by,
adversaries
it
says,
that
with
respect
to
any
other
case
except
the
habeas
corpus
case,
a
four-four
affirmance
ends
the
case,
as
between
the
parties,
and
as
to
that
matter.
some
distinction
has
been
made
by
the
federal
district
court,
because
this
is
not
an
ordinary
civil
case,
it
involves
human
liberties,
and
we
think
of
the
higher
position
in
our
jurisprudence
which
habeas
corpus
hold.
but,
we
say
that
historically
and
traditionally,
there
has
to
be
an
end
to
litigation,
and
that
it
should
have
ended
this
case.
but
our
primary
contention
with
respect
to
this,
is
an
act
of
congress,
28
u.s.c.
title
2244
(c).
that
statute
provides
and
that’s
what
we’re
relying
on
here,
it
is
found
at
page
3
of
my
brief,
that
that
statute
was
drawn
specifically
to
provide
for
finality
of
determination.
when
a
case
has
been
to
this
court
and
been
--
a
judgment
of
this
court,
it
says,
“shall
be
conclusive
as
to
all
issues
which
were
before
this
court.”
and
we
cite
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
as
well
as
commentary
in
the
harvard
law
review
and
others,
in
which
we
feel
it’s
clear
that
judge
oren
harris
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
his
letter
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
that’s
right,
your
honor.
that’s
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
beg
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
think
--
no
sir,
i
don’t
find
anything
particular
--
exactly
other
than
that
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
we
think
that
it
ends
the
case
between
the
parties
as
to
that
issue.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
as
to
that
issue.
if
that
be
the
law,
then
our
arguments
won.
but
does
it
–
we
cited
it
ends
the
case
between
the
parties
as
to
that
issue.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
there
is
no
res
judicata
in
habeas
corpus,
except
congress
has
said
that
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
oh,
excuse
me,
that's
different.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
that's
because
it's
common
law,
there
was
no
appeal
in
habeas
--
in
the
habeas
corpus.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
and
the
reason
i
suppose
i
think
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
and
i’m
going
behind
that
explaining
the
reason
that
--
if
that
law
is
it
--
but
there
is
no
res
judicata
was
because
there
was
no
appeal.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
well,
my
opinion
your
honor
is
that
the
district
judge
would
recognize
this
court’s
case
law,
and
would've
found
--
would
have
refused
to
entertain
the
case,
as
well
as
it's
controlled
by
the
same
statute.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
we
think
that
the
case
law
is
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
there
can
be
a
new
like
the
burton
rule
or
something
might
come
up
which
your
honors
suggest
on
the
case
law
makes
those
changes.
now,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
“the
legislative
was
history
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
and
hidden
much
as
in
--
exactly
clear.”
but
we
did
feel,
that
what
little
there
is,
does
support
our
position.
however,
we
are
not
--
by
succeeding
doing
nothing
more
in
my
oral
argument
today,
i
do
want
to
stress
the
second
point
of
our
contention,
and
that
is
on
the
facts,
the
district
judge
grievously
erred
in
finding
that
there
was
a
bad
confrontation.
the
--
ordinarily,
i’m
aware
this
court
wouldn’t
want
to
go
into
the
facts,
where
the
district
court
has
found
facts,
and
appellate
court
has
affirmed
it,
and
i’m
asking
your
honors
to
look
again
at
the
facts.
but
the
point
is
that
the
district
judge
didn’t
hear
any
new
facts
and
he
didn’t
weigh
the
credibility
of
evidence.
we
say
that
he
made
seven
grievous
sins.
we
cite
five
of
those
at
page
34
of
our
brief,
and
in
addition
of
those
five,
earlier
we
mentioned
the
error
that
the
district
judge
made
when
he
said
that
the
victim
changed
her
story,
and
between
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
and
that
the
police
officer
changed
his
story
between
the
time
of
the
trial
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
and
that
just
isn’t
simply
so.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
lineup
was
held.
there
were
only
three
people
who
testified
about
the
lineup
and
i’m
talking
about
the
original
trial
record
now.
those
policemen
were
detective
smith,
lieutenant
daniel
and
detective
bailey.
detective
smith
at
page
40
of
the
record,
and
detective
bailey
at
page
48
of
the
record,
said
that
this
victim
identified
the
man
before
she
heard
him
speak.
and
that
she
thereafter
asked
him
to
speak
merely
to
confirm
her
identification.
i
say
in
this,
and
i
make
an
analogy
in
my
brief
as
one
of
the
judges
in
the
lower
court
did
in
stovall,
what
would
be
the
argument
had
that
lady
in
stovall
case
died,
and
they
not
taking
the
man
over
there
to
view
mrs.
barrett,
the
victim
in
that
case.
so,
they
brought
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
the
trial
counsel
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided,
no
american
court
that
i’m
aware
of
had
ever
held
that
the
identification
was
anything
other
than
a
question
of
weight
and
not
admissibility.
the
weight
even
lower
court
cases
were
to
come
later.
this
was
in
january
--
august
of
1965.
so
the
state
believes
that
the
record
is
un-contradicted,
that
the
facts
were
that
she
identified
them
first,
all
the
parties
were
black,
the
defendant
was
in
the
company
of
two
black
officers,
she
made
--
the
victim
made
this
identification,
then
she
requested
that
he
speak.
even
the
victim
himself
in
his
affidavit
at
the
federal
habeas
hearing
doesn't
--
his
affidavit
we
cite
don't
contradict
it.
no,
the
third
officer
who
testified
about
the
lineup
was
the
supervising
officer,
lt.
mcdaniel.
and
it’s
unclear
from
his
trial
testimony,
whether
she
identified
him
first
or
heard
him
speak
first.
but
at
the
habeas
hearing,
he
--
his
memory
had
been
refreshed.
but
we
say,
it
wasn’t
the
point
at
the
trial
testimony,
who
cared?
nobody
asked
on
cross-examination,
nobody
brought
it
out,
whether
she
heard
him
speak
first
or
she
didn’t.
and
those
are
the
five
errors
as
i
say,
i’ve
listed
in
the
page,
beginning
at
page
34
of
my
brief
as
just
factual
errors
which
the
district
court,
just
made
an
error
on.
in
defense
of
the
district
judge,
let
me
say
that
i’m
the
fifth
or
sixth
attorney
who’s
handled
this
case
for
the
state,
and
when
the
habeas
petition
was
filed,
the
factual
aspects
were
shuffled
off
in
the
second
place,
because
the
state
felt
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
we
should
have
prevailed
based
on
my
first
argument.
so
these
facts
were
never
really
strenuously
argued
to
the
district
court,
but
they
are
un-contradicted
in
this
1965
transcript.
and
we
point
out
that
by
analogy
to
some
of
the
other
lineup
or
rather
one
on
one
confrontation
cases
which
this
court
has
made
that
we
believe
this
lineup
is
as
far
as
is
constitutionally
impermissible
than
others.
i
conclude.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i’ll
try
not
to
use
all
of
those
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
go
directly
to
the
court
--
about
the
dispute
–
the
factual
dispute
between
my
adversary
and
me
all
along.
we
seem
to
read
these
records
differently.
i
just
amended
to
a
go
mr.
meltsner
said
on
page
17
of
the
original
trial
record
which
unfortunately
your
honors
don’t
have,
there's
only
one
copy
in
the
supreme
court
library.
we
were
allowed
to
use
the
original
record
that
--
this
says
that
the
lady
was
identified
first
by
voice
and
i’m
reading
here
on
page
17,
“what
physical
characteristics,
if
any,
caused
you
to
be
able
to
identify
him?”
the
answer
--
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
yes.
counsel
referred
to
this
just
a
moment
ago
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
“first
of
all,
his
size;
next,
i
could
remember
his
voice.”
then
counsel
cited
your
honors
to
page
66
of
the
same
record
which
he
says
that
this
was
her
identification
of
him
first
by
his
voice,
was
confirmed
by
the
policeman,
at
that
particular
time
lt.
mcdaniel.
i’m
looking
at
page
66,
said
--
the
question
of
the
police
officer
was,
“and
when
did
that
take
place?”
right
at
that
time
when
she,
damn,
and
he
doesn’t
get
to
finish
that
word,
he
says,
“saw
him,
she
asked
us
to
have
him
repeat
the
question
which
he
repeated,
that,
and
she
also
by
voice.”
yes
sir,
well,
that’s
ambiguous,
as
i
point
on
my
brief.
the
three
offices
testified
about
the
identification
whether
or
not
it
was
voice
first
or
after,
didn’t
make
any
constitutional
difference
in
1965;
two,
he
said
she
identified
him
first
and
this
one
man
whose
testimony
is
so
ambiguous,
it
doesn’t
even
make
a
grammatical
sentence
in
the
english
language,
they
seize
on
certain
words
of
that,
at
this
page
66,
and
try
to
say
that
this
officer
said
that
she
identified
him
first
by
voice.
we
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
i
disagree
if
that
was
the
point.
i
understood
the
point
to
be
that
he’s
trying
to
show
that
this
was
a
weak
identification
and
the
voice
wasn’t
heard
as
a
mode
of
identification.
mr.
bart
c.
durham

mr.
bart
c.
durham
iii
now,
my
colleague
says
that
the
--
i
have
said
that
the
district
court
made
findings
on
a
cold
record
and
he
disagrees
with
this.
what
i
am
saying,
and
i
want
this
to
be
clear,
is
that
take
the
cold
record
of
this
trial
in
1965
here
and
take
--
supplement
that
with
the
very
limited
evidentiary
hearing
in
which
the
two
police
officers
testified
adversely
to
mr.
meltsner’s
position
and
no
one
testified
that
i
know
of
to
his
position.
and
mrs.
beamer
testified
adversely
to
his
position,
but
just
doesn't
believe
them
entirely
and
just
go
on
the
cold
record.
in
other
words,
believe
all
of
his
witnesses
before
the
district
--
united
states’
district
judge,
disbelieved
all
of
my
witnesses
before
the
united
states’
district
judge
and
my
assertion
is
that
the
record
is
still
un-contradicted
as
to
(a)
the
lady
did
not
change
her
testimony
between
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
time
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
nor
did
the
police
officers.
the
point
being
that
they
--
the
constitutional
point
that
they
are
anxious
to
convey
is
that
it
puts
them
in
a
better
constitutional
posture
if
they
can
have
it
so
that
she
identified
him
first
by
voice
and
then
by
recognition
of
the
person
and
made
no
constitutional
difference
back
then
--
back
in
that
time.
so,
the
district
judge
found
that
the
police
officer
and
the
lady
changed
their
testimony.
now,
i’m
saying
that
that
is
un-contradicted
in
the
record
that
district
judge
errs
there.
now,
counsel
mentioned
the
finding
according
to
appendix
41
of
the
district
judge’s
order,
there's
no
indication
that
a
truly
concerted
effort
was
made
to
produce
suitable
subjects
for
a
lineup
aside
from
a
phone
call
to
the
juvenile
home
and
a
screening
of
metro
jail
inmates,
no
other
efforts
were
made.
all
the
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
went
into
that
and
the
district
judge,
we
say,
just
ignored
that.
now,
i
suppose,
you
would
have
to
not
disbelieve
that
or
perhaps
that
finding
would
stand.
their
only
testimonial
was
that
this
police
officer
said,
“i
consulted
with
a
juvenile
court
judge
and
his
superior
to
jail
and
it
wasn’t
possible
to
find
anyone
of
that
size.”
the
picture
of
mr.
biggers,
all
of
them
have
introduced
into
evidence
is
a
part
of
the
original
trial
record.
he’s
a
large
boy,
he
was
only
three
days
past
his
16th
birthday
but
he’s
a
giant,
sort
of
young
man,
and
the
state
argued
that
it
was
--
that
--
they
--
extremely
difficult
to
get
young
people
that
large
or
people
that
large
who
would
be
that
young.
he’s
--
he
stand
that
up
--
they’d
stand
that
in
--
either
because
of
their
age
or
because
of
their
size.
he’s
a
giant,
16-year-old,
whose
--
who
has
a
very
distinctive
appearance.
counsel
cited
you
to
a
statement
that
mrs.
--
that
the
victim,
mrs.
beamer
made,
cite
you
to
page
125
of
the
record
where
she
says
that
her
lighting
in
the
house
was
dim.
well,
if
you
want
to
just
go
through
this
thing
and
--
on
cross-examination
and
say
well,
was
your
light
kind
of
dim,
or
something
like
that,
you
can
find
that,
but
take
the
thing
as
a
whole.
take
the
testimony
as
a
whole,
in
many
other
places
and
at
the
trial,
she
said
that
it
was
--
the
house
was,
“well
lighted.”
and
then
went
into
that
in
some
degree.
we
think
that
the
argument
of
course
is
that
the
jury’s
verdict
has
to
a
great
degree
settled
that.
the
--
i
realize
we
do
have
a
burden
here
that
--
not
an
easy
one
to
overturn
factual
findings.
the
findings
were
as
counsel
stated
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
but
to
seek
--
they
would
--
were
done
out
of
hand
as
i’ve
argued
earlier,
first
reason,
the
state
didn’t
raise
much
of
an
issue
about
the
findings
of
the
fact
in
the
sixth
circuit.
we’ve
reserved
it
but
we
didn’t
go
--
i
wouldn’t
counsel
then.
frankly,
we
didn’t
argue
that
as
strenuously
as
we
did
the
legal
argument.
all
the
sixth
circuit
said
it
was,
we’re
not
able
to
say
that
this
was
clearly
erroneous.
we
are,
i
am
able
to
tell
your
honors
that
the
finding
of
the
district
judge
is
clearly
erroneous
in
seven
aspects,
and
i’ve
listed
them
in
my
brief.
counsel
has
analogized
biggers
to
stovall,
simmons
and
some
of
the
other
identification
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
and
i
frankly
believe
that
there's
little
profit
in
there.
i
think
that
the
--
and
counsel
said
that,
i
had
no
dispute
with
the
district
judge’s
interpretation
of
what
the
law
leads
and
that’s
probably
true.
i
think,
the
district
judge
just
as
every
judge
and
as
this
court
in
light
of
stovall
says,
“was
the
man
prejudiced
by
this
identification?
was
it
an
improper
identification?
was
it
unfair
that
basically
it’s
what
it
boils
down
to?”
if
it’s
unfair,
so
unfair
as
to
deny
him
a
fair
trial,
let’s
give
him
a
new
trial.
and
the
state
respectfully
contends
that
the
totality
of
the
testimony,
the
undisputed
testimony
that
he
did
get
a
fair
trial.
thank
you,
your
honor.
