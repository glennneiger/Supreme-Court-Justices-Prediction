mr.
william
p.
dixon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
specific
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
constitutionality
of
arizona
rule
231
was
conceded
by
appellant
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
his
brief
and
as
he
says
in
the
subsequent
argument
only
went
to
whether
or
not
the
evidence
finding,
the
voluntary
waiver,
the
presence
of
trial
was
sound
enough
and
overbearing
enough
to
stand
the
problem
that
all
constitutional
waivers
have
to
stand.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
no
sir,
that
was
my
oversight
–-
mr.
william
p.
dixon
they
certainly
could
if
that
would
be
acceptable
to
this
court.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
i
would
like
to
submit
them,
can
i
–-
mr.
william
p.
dixon
i
don’t
understand
it
mr.
justice
–-
mr.
william
p.
dixon
in
the
briefs.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
no,
you
don’t
have
a
motion
for
any
trial
with
specifications
of
error
or
assignments
of
error.
you
file
a
notice
of
appeal,
your
brief
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
sets
forth
all
of
the
questions
which
you
want
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
that
is
the
rule
mr.
justice
white,
they
had
recently
probably
under
the
pressure
from
this
court
and
the
federal
courts,
been
considering
the
federal
constitutional
questions
when
they
are
raised
for
the
first
time
with
them
but
that
rule
is
of
longstanding,
but
unless
it
is
presented
first
to
the
trial
court
to
give
the
trial
court
a
chance
to
correct
its
own
mistake,
it
will
not
consider
it
on
appeal.
as
i
say
they’ve
been
ignoring
that
tacitly
in
recent
decisions
when
it
has
been
constitutional
question
that
is
first
presented
and
i
think
rightly
so
because
otherwise
they
can
go
to
the
federal
district
court
on
a
writ
of
habeas
and
there
was
no
question
about
it.
alright,
this
case
for
me
at
least
has
been
one
that
was
difficult
to
get
ahead
along
in
the
beginning
and
i
think
that
was
because
of
three
particular
reasons.
the
first
reason
being
the
claim
of
poverty,
poverty
seemed
to
raise
the
constitutional
question
that
we
have
run
roughshod
over
somebody’s
rights
over
some
poor
persons
right.
i
think
also
because
of
the
claim
that
there
had
been
no
hearing
on
voluntariness
and
untimely
of
course
when
i
searched
the
record,
we
found
that
the
trial
judge
made
no
express
decision
after
he
had
heard
all
of
the
testimony
on
his
motion
for
contempt.
but
really,
the
only
issues
of
this
case
could
ever
present
whether
before
this
court
or
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
would
be
two.
one
is
the
constitutionality
of
arizona’s
rule
231
and
the
second
issue
would
be
dependent
upon
the
resolution
of
the
first
and
that
would
be
granted
that
rule
as
constitutional
was
there
sufficient
evidence
before
the
court
to
sustain
the
finding
if
only
an
implied
finding
which
it
did
make.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
i
think
it
does
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
i
think
the
only
way
i
read
this
case
is
to
read
it
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
here.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
more
or
less
we
had
a
clear
one
where
the
burden
was
upon
the
state
and
the
burden
was
clearly
not
met.
this
is
part
of
the
reason
why
it’s
such
a
difficult
time
getting
a
handle
to
this.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
not
properly
presented
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
think
it
could
have
perhaps
come
before
this
court
in
a
proper
state
but
i
don’t
think
it
is
properly
before
you
today.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
had
the
constitutionality
of
arizona
rule
231
been
attacked
either
at
the
trial
court
or
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
it
was
not.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
or
by
a
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
as
a
matter
of
fact
state
habeas
corpus
is
still
available,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
that’s
right.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
i’m
sorry
i
didn’t
understand
that.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
in
arizona?
mr.
william
p.
dixon
no,
no,
unless
–-
mr.
william
p.
dixon
no,
i
say
it
was
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
constitutionality
of
arizona
rule
231
was
expressly
conceded
and
unfortunately,
that
didn’t
give
them
the
record
before
this
court.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
yes.
the
appellant
does
not
argue
with
that
proposition
nor
does
he
urge
the
court
to
hold
rule
231
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
perhaps
this
line
sir.
“the
thrust
of
this
argument
premised
then
on
the
fact
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
does
not
clearly
show
that
appellant
knowingly
and
intelligently
may
waive
his
right
to
be
present
at
trial.”
mr.
william
p.
dixon
now,
the
first
statement
said
he
did
not
question
the
constitutionality
of
the
rule,
the
second
statement
said
--
mr.
william
p.
dixon
alright,
from
the
beginning?
mr.
william
p.
dixon
the
established
rule
in
this
jurisdiction
as
to
criminal
trial
is
being
held
an
absentia,
has
been
set
forth
by
this
court
in
state
b-2.
this
court
in
interpreting
rule
231
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
held
in
that
case
of
a
voluntary
absence
from
trial
by
the
defendant
constitutes
a
waiver
of
the
defendant’s
right
to
be
present
during
the
trial
of
his
case.
the
appellant
does
not
argue
with
that
proposition
nor
does
he
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
rule
231
is
unconstitutional,
that’s
the
opening
paragraph
of
petitioners
brief
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
on
the
constitutional
status
of
arizona
rule
231.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
i
am
in
a
position
to
do
it
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
put
my
own
ink
marks
in
it
from
time
to
time.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
very
good.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
yes.
here
is
ours
in
this
reply
brief.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
i
have
no
further
formal
argument,
i’m
available
for
questions.
mr.
william
p.
dixon
yes

there

mr.
william
