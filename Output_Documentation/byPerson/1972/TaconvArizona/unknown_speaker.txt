unknown
speaker
did
it
show
how
he
got
back
to
new
york
in
his
own
funds?
unknown
speaker
was
he
a
new
yorker
when
he
entered
the
army?
unless
he’s
changed,
[voice
overlap]
came
in
he’s
planning
to
go
back
to
new
york
at
the
taxpayers
expense?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
explanation
for
the
long
delay
between
the
alleged
commission
of
the
offense
and
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
it
was
only
within
a
year
or
more
than
a
year,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
who
did
that
word
come
from
mr.
hirsh?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
motion
specifically?
unknown
speaker
did
he
get
there
the
next
day?
unknown
speaker
so
that
even
his
motion
got
granted,
it
would
have
been
fruitless?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
the
fact
is
–-
unknown
speaker
the
information
was
that
he
could
easily
be
there
by
that
time?
unknown
speaker
was
there
another
motion
on
the
second
of
the
night
of
the
second
day?
unknown
speaker
so
–-
unknown
speaker
there’s
no
further
motion
to
keep
the
record
open
pending
his
arrival?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
statement
that
he
was
going
to
testify
or
not?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
he
should
be
fine
if
he
did
make
it?
unknown
speaker
that
he
would
have
testified
outside
first.
unknown
speaker
has
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
ever
been
made?
unknown
speaker
how
about
colla
--
does
arizona
procedure
provide
any
way
of
collateral
relief
for
the
improper
admission
of
a
confession,
violation
of
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
you
know
why
no
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
made?
unknown
speaker
once
your
motion
might
have
been
granted,
instead
you’re
taking
the
burden
of
an
appeal
up
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
object
to
matter
of
[voice
overlap]
we’re
concerned
about.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
this,
a
defendant
is
on
bail
or
on
personal
recognizance,
he
goes
out
of
the
state,
doesn’t
violate
his
bail
and
he’s
notified
his
trials
set
and
he
simply
writes
“since
i
have
no
money
to
be
there,
until
i
do,
i
fully
intend
to
be
there
and
once
i
can
never
get
there
but
i
am
going
to,
there’s
just
no
way
of
my
i’m
getting
there.
unknown
speaker
so
until
the
state
furnishes
the
money
to
try,
they
can’t
try
him?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
again
the
state
must
furnish
the
funds
to
bring
you
back
by
extradition
for
example.
unknown
speaker
so
your
position
is
that
--
yes,
your
position
is
that
if
the
person
says
i
have
no
money
and
he
has
no
money
to
get
back,
the
state
may
not
try
him
until
it
does
something
else?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
have
to
take
that
position
in
this
case
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
this
fellow
uses
all
of
his
money
to
get
as
far
away
as
he
can
and
just
sit
there
till
the
state
comes
and
gets
him?
and
then
not
be
tried?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
your
answer
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
or
was
it
raised
by
somebody
–-
unknown
speaker
the
court
doesn’t
deal
with
that,
they
didn’t
answer
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and
in
your
statement
of
questions
you
do
when
you
come,
in
your
brief,
you
do
talk
about
constitutional
provisions
involved
but
–-
unknown
speaker
you
never
heard
any
provisions
of
the
constitution,
it
didn’t
seem
to
me
that
the,
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
really
dealt
with
–-
unknown
speaker
they
just
dealt
with
whether
or
not
there
was
here
a
voluntarily
--
a
voluntary
absence
or
an
involuntary
absence.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
conceding
the
--
all
along
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
provision
and
dealing
with
the
matter
only
as
a
question
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
but
not
dealt
with
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
if
it
wasn’t,
if
under
arizona
law
it
had
to
be
raised
at
an
earlier
stage
in
the
litigation,
i
wonder
if
your
constitutional
question
is
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
appear
–-
unknown
speaker
generally
speaking
–-
unknown
speaker
no,
you
didn’t
but
there
was
a
lawyer
there
representing
–-
unknown
speaker
in
a
contempt
hearing?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn’t
seem
to
be
talked
about
there
at
all.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
issue
really
was
it’s
whether
he
was
voluntarily
absent,
he
used
the
words
of
the
rule
or
not,
isn’t
that
right?
and
that’s
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
the
issue
that
–-
it
seems
to
have
been
dealt
with
by
the
arizona
supreme
court.
and
that
my
question
is,
is
there
any
federal
issue
before
this
court,
properly
before
this
court?
unknown
speaker
that’s
certainly
true
if
it
was
raised
in
a
timely
manner
and
that’s
my
question
and
when
and
that
would
depend
in
part
upon
arizona
law,
in
so
far
as
with,
it
doesn’t
require
you
to
raise
it
at
the
first
opportunity
or
not.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
it’s
a
pretty
good
idea?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
so
really
the
indigency
is
irrelevant
to
have
a
fellow--
unknown
speaker
or
a
fellow
who
have
court
trial,
got
plenty
of
money,
he
just
leaves
the
state
and
this
convince
him
to
avail
and
just
doesn’t
come
back.
he
just
gets
as
far
away
as
he
can
and
he
sits
there
and
said
“if
you
want
me
to
for
my
trial
then
extradite
me”
but
don’t
return.
unknown
speaker
he
is
in
a
lot
of
trouble
but
how
about
the
right
to
trial
in
absentia?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
problem
is,
does
it
come
with
the
money?
can
they
try
him
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
are
you
saying
it’s
within
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
the
affirmance
is
the
basis
that
–-
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
basis
that
he
was
voluntary
–-
unknown
speaker
right,
and
in
that
case,
was
that
case
a
constitutional
decision
or
did
it
purport
to
be?
because
this
decision
doesn’t
as
i
understand
it,
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say,
you
say
they
had
to
decide
the
federal
constitution
in
your
case
otherwise
–-
unknown
speaker
--
otherwise
it
would
just
(inaudible)
legal
jurisdictions
here.
unknown
speaker
how
they
have
decided
it.
unknown
speaker
in
which
depends
on
whether
or
not
they
had
to
under
their
system?
unknown
speaker
but
the
presumption
is
in
our
case
is
that
if
you
--
that
if
a
federal
question
is
discussed
in
a
state
supreme
court
case
is,
the
reason
is
because
it
was
not
commonly
raised
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
rule
of
our
case
though.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
the
presumption
is
the
state
has
some
rule
that
you
have
to
raise
it
earlier
than
that,
is
that
what
you
did?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
was
--
a
lot
of
cases
in
arizona
where
the
supreme
court
says
we
will
not
discuss
this
question
because
it
was
not
presented
below.
unknown
speaker
did
i
misunderstand,
just
tell
me,
did
i
misunderstand
you
a
few
moments
ago
that
an
answer
to
my
question
you
said
that
you
did
not
raise
the
basic
constitutionality
of
rule
231
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
as
you
recollect,
you
raised
only
the
constitutionality
of
the
further
presumption
is,
where
the
burden
is?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you’re
at?
unknown
speaker
and
not
a
lot
of
question
is
not
discussed
at
all
and
not
averted
to,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
they
didn’t
–-
unknown
speaker
they
didn’t
deal
with
the
constitutionality
–-
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event
you
did
not
attack
the
basic
constitutionality
under
the
federal
constitution
of
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
conceded
in
the
light
of
recently
decided
arizona
case?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
thought,
should
–-
unknown
speaker
i
wonder,
do
we,
we
don’t
have
i
suppose
in
the
present
record
the
briefs
that
were
filed
in
the
arizona
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
nobody’s
oversight
but
i
wonder
if
they
could
be
supplied?
unknown
speaker
i
want
the
--
if
the
chief
justice
is
agreeable
i
would
like
to
ask
the
–-
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
way
you
present
your
argument
or
do
you
specify
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
issues
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
in
your
briefs
or
do
you
specify
ahead
of
time
or
–-
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
have
assignments
of
error
or
–-
unknown
speaker
that’s
not
of
our
business
in
a
state
case,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
unless
there’s
in
an
absolute
absence
of
evidence
which
would
make
it
like
thompson
against
louisville.
unknown
speaker
or
by
habeas
--
federal
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
which
i
take
it
still
available
–-
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
presented
you
think
it
had
the
right
to
be
–-
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
available
to
what?
in
arizona?
unknown
speaker
lets
assume
you
do
present
a
federal
constitutional
question
in
the
criminal
case
–-
unknown
speaker
--that
is
rejected,
would
that
mean
this
raises
anything
in
state
habeas?
unknown
speaker
on
its
face,
is
that
what
it
means
or
applied
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
clear
what
you
have
been
reading
is
just
two
isolated
sentences
or
what?
unknown
speaker
and
that
he
proceeds
to
say
there,
the
thrust
of
this
brief
is
that
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
a
waiver.
unknown
speaker
i
have
--
unknown
speaker
did
it
show
how
he
got
back
to
new
york
in
his
own
funds?
unknown
speaker
was
he
a
new
yorker
when
he
entered
the
army?
unless
he’s
changed,
[voice
overlap]
came
in
he’s
planning
to
go
back
to
new
york
at
the
taxpayers
expense?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
explanation
for
the
long
delay
between
the
alleged
commission
of
the
offense
and
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
it
was
only
within
a
year
or
more
than
a
year,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
who
did
that
word
come
from
mr.
hirsh?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
motion
specifically?
unknown
speaker
did
he
get
there
the
next
day?
unknown
speaker
so
that
even
his
motion
got
granted,
it
would
have
been
fruitless?
unknown
speaker
well,
i

but
the
fact
is
–-
unknown
speaker
the
information
was
that
he
could

by
that

unknown
speaker
was
there
another
motion
on
the
second
of
the
night
of
the
second
day?
unknown
speaker
so
–-
unknown
speaker
there’s
no
further
motion
to
keep
the
record
open
pending
his
arrival?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
statement
that
he
was
going
to
testify
or
not?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
he
should
be
fine
if
he
did
make
it?
unknown
speaker
that
he
would
have
testified
outside
first.
unknown
speaker
has
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
ever
been
made?
unknown
speaker
how
about
colla
--
does
arizona

provide
any
way
of
collateral
relief
for
the
improper
admission
of
a

violation
of
the
federal

unknown

you
know
why
no
motion
for
a
new

was
made?
unknown

once
your
motion
might
have
been
granted,
instead
you’re
taking
the
burden
of
an
appeal
up
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
object
to
matter
of
[voice
overlap]
we’re
concerned
about.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
this,
a
defendant
is
on
bail
or
on
personal
recognizance,
he
goes
out
of
the
state,
doesn’t
violate
his
bail
and
he’s
notified
his
trials
set
and
he
simply
writes
“since
i
have
no
money
to
be
there,
until
i
do,
i
fully
intend
to
be
there
and
once
i
can
never
get
there
but
i
am
going
to,
there’s
just
no
way
of
my
i’m
getting
there.
unknown
speaker
so
until
the
state
furnishes
the
money
to
try,
they
can’t
try
him?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
again
the
state
must
furnish
the

to
bring
you
back
by
extradition
for

unknown
speaker
so
your
position
is
that
--
yes,
your
position
is
that
if
the
person
says
i
have
no
money
and
he
has
no
money
to
get
back,
the
state
may
not
try
him
until
it
does
something
else?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
have
to
take
that
position
in
this
case
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
this
fellow
uses
all
of
his
money
to
get
as
far
away
as
he
can
and
just
sit
there
till
the
state
comes
and
gets
him?
and
then
not
be
tried?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
your
answer
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
or
was
it
raised
by
somebody
–-
unknown
speaker
the
court
doesn’t
deal
with
that,
they
didn’t
answer
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and
in
your
statement
of
questions
you
do
when
you
come,
in
your
brief,
you
do
talk
about
constitutional
provisions
involved
but
–-
unknown
speaker
you
never
heard
any
provisions
of
the
constitution,
it
didn’t
seem
to
me
that
the,
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
really
dealt
with
–-
unknown
speaker
they
just
dealt
with
whether
or
not
there
was
here
a
voluntarily
--
a
voluntary
absence
or
an
involuntary
absence.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
conceding
the
--
all
along
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
provision
and
dealing
with
the
matter
only
as
a
question
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
but
not
dealt
with
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
if
it
wasn’t,
if
under
arizona
law
it
had
to
be
raised
at
an
earlier
stage
in
the
litigation,
i
wonder
if
your
constitutional
question
is
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
appear
–-
unknown
speaker
generally
speaking
–-
unknown
speaker
no,
you
didn’t
but
there
was
a
lawyer
there
representing
–-
unknown
speaker
in
a
contempt
hearing?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn’t
seem
to
be
talked
about
there
at
all.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
issue
really
was
it’s
whether
he
was
voluntarily
absent,
he
used
the
words
of
the
rule
or
not,
isn’t
that
right?
and
that’s
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
the
issue
that
–-
it
seems
to
have
been
dealt
with
by
the
arizona
supreme
court.
and
that
my
question
is,
is

there
and
said
“if

voluntary
–-
unknown
speaker
right,
and
in
that
case,
was
that
case
a
constitutional
decision
or
did
it
purport
to
be?
because
this
decision
doesn’t
as
i
understand
it,
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say,
you
say
they
had
to
decide
the
federal
constitution
in
your
case
otherwise
–-
unknown
speaker
--
otherwise
it
would
just
(inaudible)
legal
jurisdictions
here.
unknown
speaker
how
they
have
decided
it.
unknown
speaker
in
which
depends
on
whether
or
not
they
had
to
under
their
system?
unknown
speaker
but
the
presumption
is
in
our
case
is
that
if
you
--
that
if
a
federal
question
is
discussed
in
a
state
supreme
court
case
is,
the
reason
is
because
it
was
not
commonly
raised
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
rule
of
our
case
though.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
the
presumption
is
the
state
has
some
rule
that
you
have
to
raise
it
earlier
than
that,
is
that
what
you
did?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
was
--
a
lot
of
cases
in
arizona
where
the
supreme
court
says
we
will
not
discuss
this
question
because
it
was
not
presented
below.
unknown
speaker
did
i
misunderstand,
just
tell
me,
did
i
misunderstand
you
a
few
moments
ago
that
an
answer
to
my
question
you
said
that
you
did
not
raise
the
basic
constitutionality
of
rule
231
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
as
you
recollect,
you
raised
only
the
constitutionality
of
the
further
presumption
is,
where
the
burden
is?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you’re
at?
unknown
speaker
and
not
a
lot
of
question
is
not
discussed
at
all
and
not
averted
to,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
they
didn’t
–-
unknown
speaker
they
didn’t
deal
with
the
constitutionality
–-
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event
you
did
not
attack
the
basic
constitutionality
under
the
federal
constitution
of
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
conceded
in
the
light
of
recently
decided
arizona
case?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
thought,
should
–-
unknown
speaker
i
wonder,
do
we,
we
don’t
have
i
suppose
in
the
present
record
the
briefs
that
were
filed
in
the
arizona
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
nobody’s
oversight
but
i
wonder
if
they
could
be
supplied?
unknown
speaker
i
want
the
--
if
the
chief
justice
is
agreeable
i
would
like
to
ask
the
–-
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
way
you
present
your
argument
or
do
you
specify
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
issues
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
in
your
briefs
or
do
you
specify
ahead
of
time
or
–-
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
have
assignments
of
error
or
–-
unknown
speaker
that’s
not
of
our
business
in
a
state
case,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
unless
there’s
in
an
absolute
absence
of
evidence
which
would
make
it
like
thompson
against
louisville.
unknown
speaker
or
by
habeas
--
federal
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
which
i
take
it
still
available
–-
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
presented
you
think
it
had
the
right
to
be
–-
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
available
to
what?
in
arizona?
unknown
speaker
lets
assume
you
do
present
a
federal
constitutional
question
in
the
criminal
case
–-
unknown
speaker
--that
is
rejected,
would
that
mean
this
raises
anything
in
state
habeas?
unknown
speaker
on
its
face,
is
that
what
it
means
or
applied
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
clear
what
you
have
been
reading
is
just
two
isolated
sentences
or
what?
unknown
speaker
and
that
he
proceeds
to
say
there,
the
thrust
of
this
brief
is
that
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
a
waiver.
unknown
speaker
i
have
--
