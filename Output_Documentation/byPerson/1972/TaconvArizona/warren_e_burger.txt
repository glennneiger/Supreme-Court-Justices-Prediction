against
arizona.
mr.
hirsh,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
his
release
conditioned
in
any
way
on
remaining
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me
again
–-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
he
consult
his
--
does
the
record
show
whether
he
consulted
with
his
lawyer
before
he
left
arizona?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
he
must
be
affirmatively
advised
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
request
to
delete
the
parts,
the
irrelevant
parts
of
the
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
request
to
delete
the
–-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
maybe
the
supreme
court
would
have
granted
relief
if
your
analysis
is
correct.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there
you’re
assuming
that
on
that
motion,
the
conventional
rule
of
putting
the
burden
on
the
move
out
would
have
applied.
but
if
had
pressed
that
point
in
the
trial
court,
how
do
we
now
know
that
the
court
would
not
have
adopted
your
version
of
the
burden
of
proof?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
judge’s
utterance
is
about
his
credibility
finding
as
a
judge
could
make,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
heard
the
witness
and
signed
when
he
heard
all
the
witnesses’
reasons
and
excuses.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
position
a
normal,
normally
used
after
a
person
is
indicted
or
is
it
a
function
of
extradition
to
getting
back
for
the
purpose
of
indicting
him
and
charging.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
meanwhile,
the
state
is
to
spend
some
money
getting
other
witnesses
there
as
they
did
in
this
case,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
brought
a
man
from
another
penitentiary
or
something?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
some
substantial
expense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
--
as
justice
white
suggests
that
puts
a
premium
on
fugitivity
by
every
person
once
he
is
charged
and
puts
the
burden
on
the
charging
state
to
take
the
time,
trouble
and
expense
of
bringing
him
back.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
my
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
majority
of
defendants
this
days
don’t
need
any
subterfuge
on
the
issue
of
indigency
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn’t
it
help
any
if
the
person
left
in
violation
of
the
bail
terms,
your
position
would
be
the
same,
wouldn’t
it
not
if
he
had
left
in
violation
of
the
bail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
do
the
--
what
do
the
terms,
the
restrictions
in
the
bail
agreement
add
to
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
motion
to
suppress
the
confession
have
been
made
before
this
man
left
arizona?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can’t
make
a
pretrial
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
free
discretion
with
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
then
you
have
not
done
--
made
to
that
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hirsh,
when
and
where
did
you
raise
a
constitutional
issue
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
in
reading
their

they
seemed
