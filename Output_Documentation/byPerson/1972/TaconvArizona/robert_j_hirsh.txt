mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
could
give
the
court
a
brief
presentation
of
the
facts
in
this
particular
matter,
mr.
tacon
was
a
soldier
down
at
fort
huachuca
in
1969
and
in
february
of
that
year
he
was
arrested
for
unlawful
sale
of
marihuana,
he
was
claimed
to
have
transferred
a
little
of
an
ounce
of
marihuana
to
an
undercover
agent
and
as
the
result
of
that
arrest
was
a
charge
in
the
cochise
county
superior
court
in
south
eastern
arizona.
mr.
tacon
was
given
appointed
counsel,
he
was
released
from
his
own
recognizance,
released
back
to
his
company
commander
and
in
the
summer
of
the
that
year,
he’d
spent
time
consulting
with
his
court-appointed
attorney
and
if
there
was
a
continuance
granted
at
the
court-appointed
attorney’s
request.
there
was
no
time
set
after
the
motion
for
continuance
was
made,
the
trial
judge
didn’t
set
a
time
certain
and
in
december
of
1969,
mr.
tacon
was
discharged
from
the
service.
he
called
his
court-appointed
attorney
said,
“mr.
whitney,
i’ve
got
to
go
back
to
new
york,
i’m
discharged
from
the
service.”
mr.
whitney
thereupon
told
tacon,
“that’s
fine,
give
me
your
address
back
there
and
i’ll
notify
you
when
the
trial
comes
up.”
in
march
the
3rd
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
sir,
it
wasn’t.
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
was
raised
in
cochise
county
at
a
hearing
and
the
only
restriction
that
tacon
had
on
was
that
his
orders
had
been
plugged
and
tacon
testified
at
that
hearing
that
he
didn’t
know
the
meaning
of
that
and
all
he
understood
was
that
he
was
to
remain
at
fort
huachuca
as
long
as
he
was
in
the
army
but
he
didn’t
understand
or
have
anyone
tell
him
that
he
couldn’t
go
back
to
new
york.
the
trial
judge
had
a
different
belief
as
to
that
and
the
trial
judge
in
fact
had
claimed
that
tacon
had
violated
his
trust
and
violated
the
bail
arrangement
by
leaving
the
state
although,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
tacon
did
act
on
good
faith
when
he
went
back
to
new
york.
he
called
the
court-appointed
attorney
in
cochise
county
and
also
he
had
a
federal
charge
that
at
that
time
was
against
him
and
he
called
the
--
then
the
u.s.
commissioner
in
(inaudible)
and
the
bail
restrictions
and
the
federal
charge
did
specify
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
leave
the
state
of
arizona
without
prior
permission.
tacon
called
the
u.s.
commissioner
and
got
specific
express
permission
to
leave
the
state
and
then
went
to
new
york.
so
the
state
of
the
record
indicates
that
at
least
he
didn’t
have
any
good
faith
plea
for
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
leave
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
it
does
not
show
that.
i
assume
that
he
had
some
severance
pay
from
the
service,
for
the
service
provided
wanting
to
get
back
to
new
york.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i’m
almost
certain
that
he
was
a
new
york
resident.
i
just
–-
i
don’t
have
a
specific
recollection
of
it.
i
know
his
family
during
the
time
he
was
in
the
service
moved
to
florida
and
that
his
mother
was
a
florida
resident
at
the
time
this
particular
case
came
up
for
trial.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
it
does.
the
appendix
shows
that
in
fact,
our
hearing
after
the
trial
indicates
that
and
the
attorney
verifies
this
that
tacon
called
the
attorney
on
the
phone
and
advised
him
that
he
is
now
being
discharged
from
the
service.
he
told
him
he
was
going
to
new
york
and
the
attorney
said,
“fine,
you
just
give
me
your
address
in
new
york
in
order
to
enable
me
to
locate
you
when
the
case
is
called
for
trial.”
so
i
think
it’s
clear
from
the
record
that
tacon
did
act
in
good
faith
when
he
went
back
to
new
york
and
fairly
welcome
as
he
didn’t
violate
the
law
based
on
my
interpretation
of
the
facts.
in
any
event,
tacon
returns
to
new
york
and
on
march
the
3rd,
the
trial
judge
by
minute
entry
advised
his
counsel
that
the
trial
date
is
to
be
march
31,
1970.
the
attorney,
the
court-appointed
attorney
after
receiving
notice
of
the
trial
date
then
writes
a
letter
to
tacon
and
in
this
letter
he
merely
states
your
trial
is
now
set
for
march
31st,
i
want
you
to
be
out
in
bisbee
at
least
one
week
prior
to
the
time
set
for
trial.
that
was
it,
there
was
nothing
about
trial
absentia
if
he
wasn’t
present,
there
is
no
more
said.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
court
procedures
in
arizona
sometimes
we
have
long
delays
in
arizona
and
i
should
say,
i
shouldn’t
make
admissions
like
that
but
there’s
no
apparent
explanation.
it
is
common
at
least
in
my
county
to
have
delays
of
a
year
or
year
and
a
half
depending
on
the
court
calendar.
it’s
not
common
in
federal
court.
it
is
common
in
state
court.
they’re
trying
to
resolve
it.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes
sir,
that
matter
is
through
--
attempting
to
resolve
these
problems
right
now
and
speed
up
the
trial
process.
in
any
event,
tacon
and
i
might
add
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
opinion
is
in
error
and
the
attorney
general
is
in
error
when
they
say
that
tacon
by
that
letter
of
march
3rd
was
advised
that
he
would
be
tried
in
absentia,
this
is
the
only
notice
that
tacon
received
from
his
court-appointed
lawyer
that
is
the
letter
of
march
the
3rd.
tacon
receives
as
he
testifies
around
the
8th
or
9th
of
march
and
he
now
has
--
finds
himself
with
a
short
time
to
get
up
to
arizona
and
he
has
no
funds,
at
least
this
is
what
he
testifies
to.
on
the
28th
it
is
of
march,
he
attempts
to
call
the
court-appointed
attorney.
this
is
on
a
saturday
and
he
calls
the
attorney
in
wilcox,
arizona
in
his
home
and
he
is
unable
to
reach
him.
he
again
calls
on
monday,
that’s
the
first
business
day
after
the
weekend
and
tells
him,
“i
simply
don’t
have
the
funds
to
get
to
arizona.
i
don’t
know
what
to
do.”
and
the
court-appointed
attorney,
and
i
might
add
on
the
24th
the
county-attorney
of
cochise
county
gets
wind
off
the
fact
that
tacon
might
not
be
available
on
arizona
for
trial
and
the
state
is
bringing
a
witness
from
el
reno,
oklahoma
to
testify
and
the
county
is
anticipating
spending
some
$1,000
in
order
to
see
this
witness
get
to
cochise
county.
the
county
attorney
then
advised
of
the
judge
that
there’s
some
question
about
tacon
appearing
at
trial
and
the
judge
says,
well--
we
submitted
an
entry
on
this
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case,
the
judge
says
that
if
he’s
not
here,
we’re
going
to
try
him
on
absentia,
there
is
minute
entry
to
that
effect.
the
court-appointed
attorney
is
advised
with
this
and
in
the
telephone
conversation
that
occurs
on
march
30th.
he
tells
tacon,
this
is
the
first
time
tacon
is
advised
that
if
he
is
not
present
in
arizona,
the
very
next
day
that
he
will
tried
on
absentia,
and
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
this
goes
to
the
issue
of
waiver
and
i
think
it’s
the
states
position
that
there
was
an
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
his
right
to
be
present
then
the
waiver
is
fortified
by
the
claim
that
tacon
was
specifically
advised
that
he
would
be
tried
for
absentia
if
he
didn’t
appear.
it
simply
isn’t
the
case
at
all
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
he
did
--
was
advised
of
the
trial
date
by
the
letter
of
march
the
3rd
but
that
was
the
only
notice
he
received
and
enough
time
to
get
to
arizona
in
order
to
be
present
for
trial.
in
any
event,
the
trial
starts
march
31st,
the
court-appointed
lawyer
appears
before
the
court
and
advises
the
court
that
there
was
a
telephone
conversation
with
the
tacon
but
tacon
didn’t
have
the
funds
to
be
present.
the
judge
who
had
apparently
made
up
his
mind
from
the
week
preview
said,
“you
search
the
court
area
and
see
if
this
gentleman
is
around,
and
if
he’s
not
around
we’re
going
to
try
him
absentia.
i
am
making
a
finding
now
pursuant
to
arizona
rule
of
procedure
231”
that
tacon’s
absence
is
voluntary.
our
rule
provides
that
this
finding
is
to
be
made
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
and
we’ll
get
into
the
distinction
between
rule
43
and
the
arizona
rule
but
in
any
event,
the
finding
of
voluntariness
is
made
by
the
trial
judge
at
the
start
of
the
trial
prior
to
the
commencement
of
trial
that
morning.
they
go
through
the
first
day
of
trial;
i
might
add
parenthetically,
there
was
a
confession
extracted
from
tacon
of
a
questionable
voluntariness.
this
isn’t
in
the
record
but
they
had
tacon
locked
up
for
three
hours
after
the
sale
was
made
and
that
tacon
was
crying
and
after
three
hours
of
interrogation,
he
finally
confessed
that
he
in
fact
had
sold
a
little
marihuana
to
the
undercover
agent.
so
that
was
an
issue
of
that
second
day
of
trial.
the
first
day
of
trial,
they
selected
a
jury
and
made
opening
statements
and
examined
the
first
witness,
the
one
from
el
reno.
in
the
second
day,
the
state
had
intended
to
present
evidence
of
the
confession
for
a
voluntariness
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
court-appointed
lawyer
gets
word
after
the
first
night
of
trial
that
tacon’s
mother
now
finds
out
that
tacon
is
supposed
to
be
in
arizona
and
the
mother
is
going
to
provide
funds
for
tacon
to
arrive
in
arizona.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
way
that
the
information
got
to
the
mother
was
a
result
of
a
letter
being
sent
to
tacon’s
former
mother-in-law’s
residence
in
new
york
and
the
former
mother-in-law
then
advised
the
mother
--
the
tacon’s
mother
in
miami.
tacon’s
mother
then
called
i
believe
whitney,
the
court-appointed
lawyer
and
thereafter
hired
a
lawyer
by
the
name
burt
levey
in
miami
to
attempt
to
negotiate
with
whitney
to
see
that
tacon
arrived
in
arizona
for
trial.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
only
communication
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
sir.
the
only
communication
he
had
had
there
before
was
the
converse
--
the
telephone
conversation
on
march
30,
and
thereafter
he
didn’t
hear
directly
from
tacon.
he
heard
from
the
mother
and
then
from
it
the
attorney
in
miami.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
the
substance
of
the
conversation
was
the
fact
that
“mr.
whitney,
i
want
to
be
there.
i
intend
to
be
there
but
i
simply
don’t
have
the
funds
at
the
present
time
to
get
to
arizona
and
would
you
see
if
you
can
get
me
a
continuance.”
and
whitney
said,
“i
doubt
that
i’m
going
to
be
able.
in
fact,
i’m
sure
i
can’t.”
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
this
is
on
march
30th,
yes
sir.
this
is
on
monday,
the
first
business
day
after
the
weekend.
the
reason
he
gave
for
not
calling
earlier
was
that
he
doesn’t
know
what
to
do,
he
thought
he
was
hopeful
that
he
come
into
some
money
and
something
would
happen
that
would
enable
him
to
have
the
funds
to
arrive
in
arizona
but
his
expectation
simply
didn’t
materialized.
in
any
event,
after
the
first
day
of
trial,
the
judge
has
now
advised
that
there
are
funds
available
for
tacon
to
arrive.
there
is
a
motion
for
continuance
made
and
the
judge
again
made
a
second
express
finding
at
that
time,
denied
the
motion
for
continuance,
made
the
second
express
finding
that
tacon
was
voluntary
absent
but
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
specific
motion
was
the
motion
to
continue
for
one
day
in
order
to
enable
tacon
to
be
present
at
trial.
in
order
to,
i
suppose
impart
controvert
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
i
don’t
know
whether
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
he
got
there
on
the
third
which
would
--
he
got
there,
the
night
at
the
second
which
would
be
thursday
night,
the
trial
terminated
on
april
the
1st
that
was
on
a
wednesday.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
suppose
that
if
the
judge
would
give
him
one
day,
he’d
give
a
day
and
a
half
until
tacon
actually
appeared,
i
don’t
think
the
judge
for
that
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
the
continuance
was
for
one
day
where
the
motion
was
made
asking
for
one
day.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
expect
that
he
have
the
hopes
that
tacon
could
arrive.
in
any
event,
that
motion
was
denied,
the
case
proceeded
to
trial,
the
jury
went
out
and
promptly
found
tacon
guilty.
tacon
arrived
friday
morning,
turned
himself
in
with
there
is
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
and
remained
in
the
cochise
county
jail
until
he
was
sentenced
some
three
or
four
weeks
thereafter.
the
trial
judge
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
sir.
the
second
day
of
the
trial
terminated.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
and
the
jury
found
tacon
guilty
at
a
very
short
time.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
i
don’t
believe
there
was
that
representation.
i
don’t
see
how
the
court-appointed
attorney
could
have
made
that
representation
and
recalling
the
record,
i’m
almost
certain
it
was
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
believe
that
one
representation
that
was
made
was
that
he
wanted
to
contest
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
and
i’m
sure
that
that’s
in
the
record,
that’s
not
in
the
appendix
but
it’s
in
the
trial
record.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
he
would
have
testified
that
that
confession
was
involuntarily
made,
i
believe
again,
i
wasn’t
trial
counsel
on
the
case
and
i
know
there
were
substantial
questions
as
to
voluntariness
that
was
raised
and
the
issue
was
resolved
adversely
to
tacon
by
the
trial
judge.
but
at
least
there
would
have
been
some
chance
that
that
confession
was
excluded.
i
might
add
that
confession
was
replete
with
evidence
of
other
crimes
that
weren’t
related
to
this
and
that
might
claim
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
that
confession
should
have
not
been
admitted
because
there
were
irrelevant
material
that
showed
that
tacon
had
engaged
another
bad
action.
it’s
a
good
question.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i’m
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
he
didn’t,
he
didn’t.
this
man
did
not
have
a
lot
of
experience.
the
record
was
not
a
good
one.
i
took
the
case
on
appeal
and
i
was,
the
record
should
have
been,
could
have
been
quite
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
there
is
no
specific
procedure
other
than
appeal
but
we
have
means
of
getting
into
court
in
arizona.
we
don’t
have
a
2255
statute
or
anything
comparable
in
federal
law
but
we
call
on
petitions
coram
nobis
relief
and
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
he
could
have
raised
the
issue
on
appeal.
the
issue
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing?
i
suppose
he
could
at
this
juncture.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
not
made
because
the
burden
is
on
the,
our
position
was
the
burden
was
on
the
state
of
arizona
to
affirmatively
show
this
man’s
absence
from
trial
was
knowingly
and
voluntarily
made
and
the
state
never
presented
a
hearing
on
this
particular
matter
and
i
don’t
feel
for
the
defendant
to
now
have
the
burden
of
making
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
having
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
was
absence
--
was
violative
of
this
constitutional
right
and
violative
of
the
constitution,
and
in
order
to
have
waiver,
i
think
the
burden
of
this
court
has
long
held
the
burdens
on
the
state
of
arizona
or
in
the
government
to
show
that
waiver
and
show
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
doubt
that
in
view
of
the
trial
judge’s
feelings
towards
this
man,
i
doubt
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
granted
any
relief
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
the
matter
went
up,
the
same
issue
was
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
in
fact
the
only
--
the
first
time
that
anyone
claimed
that
there
should
have
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
made
was
in
the
response
by
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
that
perhaps
the
defendant
should
have
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
but
the
same
issues
were
presented
to
the
trial
judge,
they
were
presented
to
the
--
i
take
the
back,
they
weren’t
presented
to
the
trial
judge,
they
were
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
didn’t
mention
our
rule
311
that
provides
promotion
for
a
new
trial.
the
arizona
supreme
court
met
the
issue
directly
and
held
that
the
absence
of
tacon
was
voluntary,
that
rule
231
was
constitutional
and
that
that
was
the
end
of
it.
so,
i
think
it’s
superfluous,
number
one
to
have
made
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
number
two,
i
think
that
again
that
would
be
at
odds
with
the
constitution
because
it
replace
the
burden
on
showing
waiver
on
the
defendant,
and
again
that’s
complex
with
all
the
principles
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
of
course,
you
can’t
be
certain,
i
know
this
judge
personally.
i
have
doubts
[voice
overlap].
i
understand
that.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
have
doubts
that
he
would
have
accepted
that
and
perhaps
i
wish
we’re
missing
not
making
a
request
but
to
say
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
that
motion
should
have
been
made
was
never
brought
up,
was
never
raised
in
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it’s
now
raised
for
the
first
time
by
the
attorney
general
here
and
i
think
if
the
state
wanted
to
interpose
that
argument,
perhaps
they
should
have
raised
it
for
some
previous
time,
in
view
the
fact
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
resolve
this
matter
on
the
issue.
my
position
in
this
particular
matter
i
might
add
after
the
trial
terminated,
there
was
a
contempt
hearing.
tacon
received
the
sentence
for
five
to
five-and-a-half
years
in
the
arizona
state
penitentiary
by
this
judge
and
short
time
after
judgment
was
entered
and
sentence
was
passed,
he
filed
a,
he
directed
the
county
attorney
to
file
an
order
to
show
cause
ordering
tacon
to
show
cause
why
he
shouldn’t
be
held
in
contempt
for
failing
to
abide
by
the
court’s
order
appearing
at
the
time
specified
in
the
minute
entry.
that
was
my
fist
appearance
in
the
case
and
the
result
of
that
was
that
we
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
tacon
willfully
and
intentionally
absent
himself
from
the
jurisdiction
and
we
didn’t
get
into
the
constitutional
question
although
the
hearing
was
akin
to
the
issue
that’s
before
the
court
now.
the
trial
judge
after
hearing
all
of
the
evidence
took
the
matter
under
advisement
and
it
is
to
this
day
still
under
advisement.
he
never
did
rule
as
to
whether
or
not
tacon
was
held
or
should
be
held
in
contempt
for
his
willful
failure
to
appear.
he
did
state
and
i
might
add
--
state
virtuously
on
the
record
that
after
tacon,
at
the
close
of
the
hearing,
tacon
requested
to
make
a
statement
to
the
court
and
at
state
he
said,
“your
honor,
i
swore
to
you
that
i
intended
to
be
present
at
trial.
i
never
intended
to
absent
myself
and
i
swore
to
you
that
what
i’ve
told
you
is
the
truth.”
and
the
trial
judge
at
that
time
said.
“mr.
tacon,
i
can
assure
you
that
i’m
not
in
impress
one
bit
with
your
stated
intention
at
this
time”
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
we
took
the
appeal
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
it
was
on
that
language
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
that
the
trial
judge
apparently
felt
that
this
man
willfully,
intentionally
absent
himself
from
the
jurisdiction
and
did
not
voluntarily
waived
his
right
to
be
present
at
the
trial
and
they
used
that
language
as
to,
as
a
claim
that
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
again,
i
distinguished
that.
but
the
issue
says
--
well
it
wasn’t
presented
to
the
court
and
i
think
that
when
we’re
talking
about
a
finding
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes.
but
i
think
when
we’re
talking
about
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
question
of
waiver,
as
to
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right,
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
little
more
specificity
than
a
judge’s
reaction
to
the
witnesses’
testimony,
and
i
think
were
talking
about
in
fact
an
evidentiary
hearing,
that’s
what
this
court
has
always
mandated,
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
be
made
and
that
specific
findings
be
determined
by
the
court.
there
were
no
specific
findings
and
i
grant
the
court
that
perhaps
you
can
infer
what
the
findings
might
have
been
had
they
been
squarely
presented
to
the
court
but
there
were
no
such
findings
made
and
the
issue
was
never
squarely
presented
to
the
court
and
to
this
day,
there
is
no
issue
for
finding
the
fact
or
in
the
question
of
whether
anthony
tacon
voluntarily
appeared
or
voluntarily
failed
appearance,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
give
the
state
the
right
to
try
on
individual
absentia.
if
there’s
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
no
sir,
no,
i
think
what
the
state
can
do
at
that
time
is
start
extradite,
if
the
state
feels
that
there’s
no
other
alternative
in
this
matter,
then
i
think
they
can
extradite,
they
can
forfeit
the
bail,
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
he’ll
have
to
brought
back
under
compulsion
and
his
bail
is
going
to
be
forfeited
and
he
is
going
to
be
charged
with
bail
jumping
if
that
jurisdiction
is
a
bail
jumping
statute
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
the
traditional
function
but
they
can’t
extradite
under
those
circumstances
where
someone,
at
least
there’s
a
claim
or
finding
by
authority
that
someone
has
violated
his
bail
agreement.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
correct
and
the
reason
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
i
don’t
have
to.
i
can
be
successful
in
this
case
by
claiming
that
there
was
finding
of
fact
and
that
the
procedures
in
arizona
are
incompatible
with
the
constitution,
that
is
the
finding
should
be
made
at
the
termination
of
the
trial
and
not
such
finding
was
made
in
this
case
and
ask
the
court
to
return
this
case
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
finding
by
a
trial
judge,
that
to
me
is
not
satisfactory,
that
one
i
don’t
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
it’s
like
the
witness
that
perhaps
might
have
just
gone
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
el
reno
oklahoma,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
sir.
but
you
have
to
weigh
that
with
the
fact
that
the
probability
that
it
depends
not
going
to
receive
a
fair
trial
if
he’s
absent
and
that’s
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
if
a
person
uses
this
claim
of
poverty
as
a
subterfuge
to
avoid
returning
to
the
state,
i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
means
that
you
can
use
to
avoid
going
to
trial.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
but
it
doesn’t
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
this
person
shall
be
constitutionally
tried
in
absentia.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
other
way
to
obviate
that
--
resolve
that
problem
would
be
to
make
to
have
bail
restrictions,
restrict
the
individual
to
the
state,
that
would
be
in
other
way
of
resolving
that
problem
and
in
our
federal
court,
we’re
required,
defense
are
required
to
call
counsel
once
a
week
to
keep
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct
that
he
still
could
not
be
–--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
they
might
give
the
local
court
more
control
over
the
defendant
in
the
hopes
that
he
will
abide
by
that
bail
arrangement
but
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
done.
the
question
is
weighing
the
fact
of
trying
someone
in
absentia
in
this
particular
instance,
the
court-appointed
counsel
in
fact
in
most
instances,
the
court-appointed
counsel
without
that
individual
being
present
to
be
at
the
trial,
to
make
sure,
to
assure
that
there’s
integrity
in
that
trial
and
insure
that
court-appointed
counsel
does
his
job
as
opposed
to
the
state’s
policy
of
proceeding
with
the
trial
in
the
defendants
absence
and
in
so
weighing
i
think
it’s
a
matter
of
policy.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
sir.
we
don’t
have
any
provisions,
any
procedural
provisions
in
our
state
procedure
to
suppress
confessions
prior
to
trial.
you
can
suppress
unlawfully
obtained
evidence
but
as
far
as
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
concerned,
that
has
to
be
done
at
trial.
we
don’t
have
any
specific
rule
unless
the
trial
judge
grants
you
permission
to
have
that
done
prior
to
trouble.
we
don’t
have
any
rules
that
enable
that
to
be
done.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
it’s
not
really.
the
custom
is
to
do
it
at
the
time
of
trial.
i’ve
done
it
prior
to
trial
when
i’ve
made
special
arrangement
with
the
prosecutor
and
with
the
court
but
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
sir.
no
it
wasn’t.
i
don’t
know
what
the
state
of
preparation
that
the
court-appointed
counsel
had
prior
to
the
commencement
of
trial
and
again
that’s
another
reason
to
my
mind
that
you
got
to
strike
the
balance
as
far
as
policy
is
concerned
and
i
think
the
better
one
is
in
favor
of
the
defendant
rather
than
in
favor
of
the,
facilitating
the
states
trial
of
an
individual
and
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
it
was
raised
before
the
arizona
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
the
latter
aspect
of
my
claim
today
was
raised.
i
would
tell
you
that
i
read
my
brief
and
i
believed
i
might
have
conceded
the
constitutional
validity
in
part
of
231
because
it
just
recently
been
ruled
upon
by
our
court
but
i
did
claim
that
the
procedures
used,
that
is
the
placing
the
burden
on
the
defendant
was
violative
of
his
constitutional
right
and
that
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
they
didn’t
answer
that
question
in
dealing
with
any,
affirm
the
least
the
implicit
finding
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
let
me
state
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
the
latter
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
the
latter
issue
as
to
the
waiver
aspect
and
the
constitutional
validity,
the
waiver
and
the
arizona
procedure
was
raised,
that
issue
was
raised
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
not
dealt
with.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
there
was
a
first
opportunity
i
had
to
raise
a
question
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
--
in
the
supreme
court
and
i
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
--i
had
no
opportunity
to
go
back
before
the
trial
of
the
trial
court
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
there
was
a
lawyer,
i
might
add,
he
might
have
said
something
to
that
effect
to
the,
in
the
transcript
of
record
but
i’d
have
to
go
back
(inaudible)
of
the
trial
proceedings
to
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
understand
that
and
i
just
can’t
answer
the
question
your
honor
as
to
whether
or
not
that
question
was
specifically
raised
by
mr.
whitney,
i
just
don’t
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
sir.
in
the
contempt
hearing
i
didn’t
raise
it
at
all
because
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes.
we
didn’t
raise
it
at
all,
it’s
concerned
with
that
narrow
issue
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
at
the,
as
far
as
the
trial
was
concerned.
i
just
don’t,
i
only
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
i’ve
gone
through
this
before
in
federal
habeas
corpus
and
the
judge
said,
“well
as
the
arizona
supreme
court
didn’t
deal
with
this
matter
and
you’re
therefore
precluded.”
then
i
said,
“well
the
issue
was
raised,
it’s
not
my
fault
that
they
didn’t
mentioned
it
in
the
opinion,
i
can’t
help
what
they
put
in
their
opinions.”
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
a
general
principle
of
law,
i
don’t,
that
i’ve
always
adhered
to
in
whether
that’s
a,
we
have
a
peculiar,
i’m
almost
certain
there
is
no
specific
statute
or
rule
to
that
effect
or
i
can’t
even
recall
reading
an
arizona
case
to
that
effect.
i
know
as
a
matter
of
practice
i
always
i
do
it
and
i
always
assume
that’s
based
on
case
law
and
it
sounds
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
sound
principles
of
law.
i
only
have
a
couple
of
minutes
and
i’d
like
to
tell
the
court
i
haven’t
got
around
advocating
my
position
and
my
position
is
one,
that
rule
231
is
unconstitutionally
valid
that
the
only
time
that
the
defendant
to
be
tried
in
absentia
would
be
one
where
he
expressly
consents
thereto
or
he
makes
an
express
waiver
prior
to
trial
or
under
a
rule
43
situation
that
is
where
he
appears
at
the
trial,
the
start
of
the
trial
and
thereafter
absconds
or
leaves
because
there
you
have
at
least
have
an
inference
that
he
consulted
with
counsel,
that
he
certainly
knew
about
the
trial,
that
he
was
ready
to
try
the
case
thereafter
leaves
for
disrupted
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that
would
be
my
position
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
i
think
this
court
has
so
held
if
you
read
the
line
of
cases,
the
up
through
diaz
and
it’s
always
been
the
position
of
this
court
that
the
position
is
embodied
in
rule
43
and
i
think
even
if
there
is
a
situation
where
he
absconds
after
he
is
present
in
the
first
day
of
trial,
i
think
there
still
has
to
be
a
later
determination
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
that
fellow
is
in
a
lot
of
trouble
too
because
he’s
not
only
going
to
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
as
i
say,
it’s
a
matter
of
policy
and
it’s
a
matter
of
policy
of
weighing
the
principle
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
it’s
a
vexatious
and
a
difficult
one.
i’m
puzzled
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
my
position
would
be
they
cannot
because
it’s
incompatible
with
the
constitution
with
the
defendant’s
right
necessity
be
present
at
the
trial
and
they
say
it’s
a
matter
of
striking
a
balance
and
i’m
puzzled
with
this
for
some
weeks
and
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
my
case,
i
haven’t
add
a
factor,
the
fact,
this
man
was
innocent
might
--
factually,
i
feel
that
he
didn’t
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
his
right
to
be
present
because
he
simply
didn’t
have
the
funds
to
appear
but
if
you
ask
me
hypothetically
if
there
is
any
difference
as
far
as
position,
i
would
take
there
would
be
no
difference.
and
my
alternative
position
if
you
reject
my
first,
the
one
i
just
stated
to
you
would
be
that
at
a
minimum,
if
you
reject
the
fact
and
agree
that
rule
231
is
valid,
i
might
tell
you
what
they’ve
done
on
rule
231
in
arizona.
there
was
a
recent
case
decided
by
our
supreme
court
that’s,
we
cited
state
versus
davis
was
decided
the
day
or
two
before
this
court
accepted
cert
in
my
petition
where
they
had
given
notice
to
the
defendant
and
he
wasn’t
seen
thereafter
and
he
was
tried
on
absentia
and
no
one
had
seen
him,
by
some
and
the
court-appointed
lawyer
and
he
was
convicted
and
i
don’t
recall
whether
he
sentenced.
and
that
case
was
affirmed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
apparently
as
it
set
a
rule
in
arizona
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
basis
of
my
case
had
taken.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
presumption
that
he
had
voluntarily
absent
himself
arose
as
a
result
of
him
being
given
notice
of
the
trial
date.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i’m
almost
certain
that
issue
was
raised,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
went
up,
it
was
certified
by
our
supreme
court,
the
special
procedure
we
have
in
arizona
and
i’m
almost
certain
the
constitutional
issue
was
raised
in
that
case.
that
again
rule
231
was
attacked
and
the
supreme
court
whether
they
answered
it
in
constitutional
terms
and
i
don’t
recall.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
it
was
raised
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
the
issue
was
raised
and
by
implication
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
by
implication
they
did
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
by
implication
they
decided
it
by
virtue
of
their
affirmance
because
the
issue
was
raised
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes.
well,
i
think
it’s
in
a
presumption
that
probably
shouldn’t
be
indulged
in.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
record.
certainly,
the
petitioner
should
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
petitioner
shouldn’t
be
penalized
because
the
appellate
bench
in
a
particular
state
doesn’t
resolve
a
question
that’s
otherwise
raised
by
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
that
wasn’t
why,
i’m
sure
that’s
wasn’t
why,
it
wasn’t
discussed
in
the
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
--
supreme
court
opinion,
the
matter
when
the
issue
was
raised
was
never
mentioned
and
never
brought
up
till,
i’m
sure
there
wasn’t
on
that
basis
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
no,
i
couldn’t
say
why
the
issue
wasn’t
discussed
in
the
opinion,
maybe
perhaps
the
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well
that
wasn’t
the
situation
here,
at
least
as
far
as
the
opinion
was
concerned.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
raised
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
as
far
as
getting
to
the
basic
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
don’t
believe
they
discussed
that
at
all.
well,
it
did,
they
did
a
little
to
it
in
one
or
two
sentences.
if
you
can
call
this
an
allusion
to
that,
my
claim
they
said
that
in
arizona
the
rule
is
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
defendant
is
given
notice
and
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
as
far
as
using
the
phrase,
this
is
constitutional
or
is
compatible
with
the
u.s.
constitution,
i
don’t
believe
they
did
but
they
say
it
by
implication,
the
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
correct
your
honor,
in
fact
i
expressly
conceded
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
--
because
of
a
recently
decided
case
that
i
felt
that
i
couldn’t
get
anywhere
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
and
in
retrospect,
i
see
that
was
mistake
and
should
have
been
attacked
at
time
because
i
see
some
real,
the
constitutional
impediments
to
not
only
the
rule
but
the
procedure
used.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
could
give
the
court
a
brief
presentation
of
the
facts
in
this
particular
matter,
mr.
tacon
was
a
soldier
down
at
fort
huachuca
in
1969
and
in
february
of
that
year
he
was
arrested
for
unlawful
sale
of
marihuana,
he
was
claimed
to
have
transferred
a
little
of
an
ounce
of
marihuana
to
an
undercover
agent
and
as
the
result
of
that
arrest
was
a
charge
in
the
cochise
county
superior
court
in
south
eastern
arizona.
mr.
tacon
was
given
appointed
counsel,
he
was
released
from
his
own
recognizance,
released
back
to
his
company
commander
and
in
the
summer
of
the
that
year,
he’d
spent
time
consulting
with
his
court-appointed
attorney
and
if
there
was
a
continuance
granted
at
the
court-appointed
attorney’s
request.
there
was
no
time
set
after
the
motion
for
continuance
was
made,
the
trial
judge
didn’t
set
a
time
certain
and
in
december
of
1969,
mr.
tacon
was
discharged
from
the
service.
he
called
his
court-appointed
attorney
said,
“mr.
whitney,
i’ve
got
to
go
back
to
new
york,
i’m
discharged
from
the
service.”
mr.
whitney
thereupon
told
tacon,
“that’s
fine,
give
me
your
address
back
there
and
i’ll
notify
you
when
the
trial
comes
up.”
in
march
the
3rd
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
sir,
it
wasn’t.
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
was
raised
in
cochise
county
at
a
hearing
and
the
only
restriction
that
tacon
had
on
was
that
his
orders
had
been
plugged
and
tacon
testified
at
that
hearing
that
he
didn’t
know
the
meaning
of
that
and
all
he
understood
was
that
he
was
to
remain
at
fort
huachuca
as
long
as
he
was
in
the
army
but
he
didn’t
understand
or
have
anyone
tell
him
that
he
couldn’t
go
back
to
new
york.
the
trial
judge
had
a
different
belief
as
to
that
and
the
trial
judge
in
fact
had
claimed
that
tacon
had
violated
his
trust
and
violated
the
bail
arrangement
by
leaving
the
state
although,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
tacon
did
act
on
good
faith
when
he
went
back
to
new
york.
he
called
the
court-appointed
attorney
in
cochise
county
and
also
he
had
a
federal
charge
that
at
that
time
was
against
him
and
he
called
the
--
then
the
u.s.
commissioner
in
(inaudible)
and
the
bail
restrictions
and
the
federal
charge
did
specify
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
leave
the
state
of
arizona
without
prior
permission.
tacon
called
the
u.s.
commissioner
and
got
specific
express
permission
to
leave
the
state
and
then
went
to
new
york.
so
the
state
of
the
record
indicates
that
at
least
he
didn’t
have
any
good
faith
plea
for
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
leave
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
it
does
not
show
that.
i
assume
that
he
had
some
severance
pay
from
the
service,
for
the
service
provided
wanting
to
get
back
to
new
york.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i’m
almost
certain
that
he
was
a
new
york
resident.
i
just
–-
i
don’t
have
a
specific
recollection
of
it.
i
know
his
family
during
the
time
he
was
in
the
service
moved
to
florida
and
that
his
mother
was
a
florida
resident
at
the
time
this
particular
case
came
up
for
trial.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
it
does.
the
appendix
shows
that
in
fact,
our
hearing
after
the
trial
indicates
that
and
the
attorney
verifies
this
that
tacon
called
the
attorney
on
the
phone
and
advised
him
that
he
is
now
being
discharged
from
the
service.
he
told
him
he
was
going
to
new
york
and
the
attorney
said,
“fine,
you
just
give
me
your
address
in
new
york
in
order
to
enable
me
to
locate
you
when
the
case
is
called
for
trial.”
so
i
think
it’s
clear
from
the
record
that
tacon
did
act
in
good
faith
when
he
went
back
to
new
york
and
fairly
welcome
as
he
didn’t
violate
the
law
based
on
my
interpretation
of
the
facts.
in
any
event,
tacon
returns
to
new
york
and
on
march
the
3rd,
the
trial
judge
by
minute
entry
advised
his
counsel
that
the
trial
date
is
to
be
march
31,
1970.
the
attorney,
the
court-appointed
attorney
after
receiving
notice
of
the
trial
date
then
writes
a
letter
to
tacon
and
in
this
letter
he
merely
states
your
trial
is
now
set
for
march
31st,
i
want
you
to
be
out
in
bisbee
at
least
one
week
prior
to
the
time
set
for
trial.
that
was
it,
there
was
nothing
about
trial
absentia
if
he
wasn’t
present,
there
is
no
more
said.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
court
procedures
in
arizona
sometimes
we
have
long
delays
in
arizona
and
i
should
say,
i
shouldn’t
make
admissions
like
that
but
there’s
no
apparent
explanation.
it
is
common
at
least
in
my
county
to
have
delays
of
a
year
or
year
and
a
half
depending
on
the
court
calendar.
it’s
not
common
in
federal
court.
it
is
common
in
state
court.
they’re
trying
to
resolve
it.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes
sir,
that
matter
is
through
--
attempting
to
resolve
these
problems
right
now
and
speed
up
the
trial
process.
in
any
event,
tacon
and
i
might
add
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
opinion
is
in
error
and
the
attorney
general
is
in
error
when
they
say
that
tacon
by
that
letter
of
march
3rd
was
advised
that
he
would
be
tried
in
absentia,
this
is
the
only
notice
that
tacon
received
from
his
court-appointed
lawyer
that
is
the
letter
of
march
the
3rd.
tacon
receives
as
he
testifies
around
the
8th
or
9th
of
march
and
he
now
has
--
finds
himself
with
a
short
time
to
get
up
to
arizona
and
he
has
no
funds,
at
least
this
is
what
he
testifies
to.
on
the
28th
it
is
of
march,
he
attempts
to
call
the
court-appointed
attorney.
this
is
on
a
saturday
and
he
calls
the
attorney
in
wilcox,
arizona
in
his
home
and
he
is
unable
to
reach
him.
he
again
calls
on
monday,
that’s
the
first
business
day
after
the
weekend
and
tells
him,
“i
simply
don’t
have
the
funds
to
get
to
arizona.
i
don’t
know
what
to
do.”
and
the
court-appointed
attorney,
and
i
might
add
on
the
24th
the
county-attorney
of
cochise
county
gets
wind
off
the
fact
that
tacon
might
not
be
available
on
arizona
for
trial
and
the
state
is
bringing
a
witness
from
el
reno,
oklahoma
to
testify
and
the
county
is
anticipating
spending
some
$1,000
in
order
to
see
this
witness
get
to
cochise
county.
the
county
attorney
then
advised
of
the
judge
that
there’s
some
question
about
tacon
appearing
at
trial
and
the
judge
says,
well--
we
submitted
an
entry
on
this
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case,
the
judge
says
that
if
he’s
not
here,
we’re
going
to
try
him
on
absentia,
there
is
minute
entry
to
that
effect.
the
court-appointed
attorney
is
advised
with
this
and
in
the
telephone
conversation
that
occurs
on
march
30th.
he
tells
tacon,
this
is
the
first
time
tacon
is
advised
that
if
he
is
not
present
in
arizona,
the
very
next
day
that
he
will
tried
on
absentia,
and
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
this
goes
to
the
issue
of
waiver
and
i
think
it’s
the
states
position
that
there
was
an
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
his
right
to
be
present
then
the
waiver
is
fortified
by
the
claim
that
tacon
was
specifically
advised
that
he
would
be
tried
for
absentia
if
he
didn’t
appear.
it
simply
isn’t
the
case
at
all
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
he
did
--
was
advised
of
the
trial
date
by
the
letter
of
march
the
3rd
but
that
was
the
only
notice
he
received
and
enough
time
to
get
to
arizona
in
order
to
be
present
for
trial.
in
any
event,
the
trial
starts
march
31st,
the
court-appointed
lawyer
appears
before
the
court
and
advises
the
court
that
there
was
a
telephone
conversation
with
the
tacon
but
tacon
didn’t
have
the
funds
to
be
present.
the
judge
who
had
apparently
made
up
his
mind
from
the
week
preview
said,
“you
search
the
court
area
and
see
if
this
gentleman
is
around,
and
if
he’s
not
around
we’re
going
to
try
him
absentia.
i
am
making
a
finding
now
pursuant
to
arizona
rule
of
procedure
231”
that
tacon’s
absence
is
voluntary.
our
rule
provides
that
this
finding
is
to
be
made
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
and
we’ll
get
into
the
distinction
between
rule
43
and
the
arizona
rule
but
in
any
event,
the
finding
of
voluntariness
is
made
by
the
trial
judge
at
the
start
of
the
trial
prior
to
the
commencement
of
trial
that
morning.
they
go
through
the
first
day
of
trial;
i
might
add
parenthetically,
there
was
a
confession
extracted
from
tacon
of
a
questionable
voluntariness.
this
isn’t
in
the
record
but
they
had
tacon
locked
up
for
three
hours
after
the
sale
was
made
and
that
tacon
was
crying
and
after
three
hours
of
interrogation,
he
finally
confessed
that
he
in
fact
had
sold
a
little
marihuana
to
the
undercover
agent.
so
that
was
an
issue
of
that
second
day
of
trial.
the
first
day
of
trial,
they
selected
a
jury
and
made
opening
statements
and
examined
the
first
witness,
the
one
from
el
reno.
in
the
second
day,
the
state
had
intended
to
present
evidence
of
the
confession
for
a
voluntariness
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
court-appointed
lawyer
gets
word
after
the
first
night
of
trial
that
tacon’s
mother
now
finds
out
that
tacon
is
supposed
to
be
in
arizona
and
the
mother
is
going
to
provide
funds
for
tacon
to
arrive
in
arizona.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
way
that
the
information
got
to
the
mother
was
a
result
of
a
letter
being
sent
to
tacon’s
former
mother-in-law’s
residence
in
new
york
and
the
former
mother-in-law
then
advised
the
mother
--
the
tacon’s
mother
in
miami.
tacon’s
mother
then
called
i
believe
whitney,
the
court-appointed
lawyer
and
thereafter
hired
a
lawyer
by
the
name
burt
levey
in
miami
to
attempt
to
negotiate
with
whitney
to
see
that
tacon
arrived
in
arizona
for
trial.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
only
communication
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
sir.
the
only
communication
he
had
had
there
before
was
the
converse
--
the
telephone
conversation
on
march
30,
and
thereafter
he
didn’t
hear
directly
from
tacon.
he
heard
from
the
mother
and
then
from
it
the
attorney
in
miami.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
the
substance
of
the
conversation
was
the
fact
that
“mr.
whitney,
i
want
to
be
there.
i
intend
to
be
there
but
i
simply
don’t
have
the
funds
at
the
present
time
to
get
to
arizona
and
would
you
see
if
you
can
get
me
a
continuance.”
and
whitney
said,
“i
doubt
that
i’m
going
to
be
able.
in
fact,
i’m
sure
i
can’t.”
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
this
is
on
march
30th,
yes
sir.
this
is
on
monday,
the
first
business
day
after
the
weekend.
the
reason
he
gave
for
not
calling
earlier
was
that
he
doesn’t
know
what
to
do,
he
thought
he
was
hopeful
that
he
come
into
some
money
and
something
would
happen
that
would
enable
him
to
have
the
funds
to
arrive
in
arizona
but
his
expectation
simply
didn’t
materialized.
in
any
event,
after
the
first
day
of
trial,
the
judge
has
now
advised
that
there
are
funds
available
for
tacon
to
arrive.
there
is
a
motion
for
continuance
made
and
the
judge
again
made
a
second
express
finding
at
that
time,
denied
the
motion
for
continuance,
made
the
second
express
finding
that
tacon
was
voluntary
absent
but
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
specific
motion
was
the
motion
to
continue
for
one
day
in
order
to
enable
tacon
to
be
present
at
trial.
in
order
to,
i
suppose
impart
controvert
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
i
don’t
know
whether
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
he
got
there
on
the
third
which
would
--
he
got
there,
the
night
at
the
second
which
would
be
thursday
night,
the
trial
terminated
on
april
the
1st
that
was
on
a
wednesday.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
suppose
that
if
the
judge
would
give
him
one
day,
he’d
give
a
day
and
a
half
until
tacon
actually
appeared,
i
don’t
think
the
judge
for
that
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
the
continuance
was
for
one
day
where
the
motion
was
made
asking
for
one
day.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
expect
that
he
have
the
hopes
that
tacon
could
arrive.
in
any
event,
that
motion
was
denied,
the
case
proceeded
to
trial,
the
jury
went
out
and
promptly
found
tacon
guilty.
tacon
arrived
friday
morning,
turned
himself
in
with
there
is
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
and
remained
in
the
cochise
county
jail
until
he
was
sentenced
some
three
or
four
weeks
thereafter.
the
trial
judge
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
sir.
the
second
day
of
the
trial
terminated.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
and
the
jury
found
tacon
guilty
at
a
very
short
time.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
i
don’t
believe
there
was
that
representation.
i
don’t
see
how
the
court-appointed
attorney
could
have
made
that
representation
and
recalling
the
record,
i’m
almost
certain
it
was
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
believe
that
one
representation
that
was
made
was
that
he
wanted
to
contest
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
and
i’m
sure
that
that’s
in
the
record,
that’s
not
in
the
appendix
but
it’s
in
the
trial
record.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
he
would
have
testified
that
that
confession
was
involuntarily
made,
i
believe
again,
i
wasn’t
trial
counsel
on
the
case
and
i
know
there
were
substantial
questions
as
to
voluntariness
that
was
raised
and
the
issue
was
resolved
adversely
to
tacon
by
the
trial
judge.
but
at
least
there
would
have
been
some
chance
that
that
confession
was
excluded.
i
might
add
that
confession
was
replete
with
evidence
of
other
crimes
that
weren’t
related
to
this
and
that
might
claim
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
that
confession
should
have
not
been
admitted
because
there
were
irrelevant
material
that
showed
that
tacon
had
engaged
another
bad
action.
it’s
a
good
question.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i’m
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
he
didn’t,
he
didn’t.
this
man
did
not
have
a
lot
of
experience.
the
record
was
not
a
good
one.
i
took
the
case
on
appeal
and
i
was,
the
record
should
have
been,
could
have
been
quite
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
there
is
no
specific
procedure
other
than
appeal
but
we
have
means
of
getting
into
court
in
arizona.
we
don’t
have
a
2255
statute
or
anything
comparable
in
federal
law
but
we
call
on
petitions
coram
nobis
relief
and
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
he
could
have
raised
the
issue
on
appeal.
the
issue
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing?
i
suppose
he
could
at
this
juncture.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
not
made
because
the
burden
is
on
the,
our
position
was
the
burden
was
on
the
state
of
arizona
to
affirmatively
show
this
man’s
absence
from
trial
was
knowingly
and
voluntarily
made
and
the
state
never
presented
a
hearing
on
this
particular
matter
and
i
don’t
feel
for
the
defendant
to
now
have
the
burden
of
making
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
having
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
was
absence
--
was
violative
of
this
constitutional
right
and
violative
of
the
constitution,
and
in
order
to
have
waiver,
i
think
the
burden
of
this
court
has
long
held
the
burdens
on
the
state
of
arizona
or
in
the
government
to
show
that
waiver
and
show
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
doubt
that
in
view
of
the
trial
judge’s
feelings
towards
this
man,
i
doubt
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
granted
any
relief
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
the
matter
went
up,
the
same
issue
was
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
in
fact
the
only
--
the
first
time
that
anyone
claimed
that
there
should
have
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
made
was
in
the
response
by
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
that
perhaps
the
defendant
should
have
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
but
the
same
issues
were
presented
to
the
trial
judge,
they
were
presented
to
the
--
i
take
the
back,
they
weren’t
presented
to
the
trial
judge,
they
were
presented
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
didn’t
mention
our
rule
311
that
provides
promotion
for
a
new
trial.
the
arizona
supreme
court
met
the
issue
directly
and
held
that
the
absence
of
tacon
was
voluntary,
that
rule
231
was
constitutional
and
that
that
was
the
end
of
it.
so,
i
think
it’s
superfluous,
number
one
to
have
made
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
number
two,
i
think
that
again
that
would
be
at
odds
with
the
constitution
because
it
replace
the
burden
on
showing
waiver
on
the
defendant,
and
again
that’s
complex
with
all
the
principles
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
of
course,
you
can’t
be
certain,
i
know
this
judge
personally.
i
have
doubts
[voice
overlap].
i
understand
that.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
have
doubts
that
he
would
have
accepted
that
and
perhaps
i
wish
we’re
missing
not
making
a
request
but
to
say
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
that
motion
should
have
been
made
was
never
brought
up,
was
never
raised
in
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it’s
now
raised
for
the
first
time
by
the
attorney
general
here
and
i
think
if
the
state
wanted
to
interpose
that
argument,
perhaps
they
should
have
raised
it
for
some
previous
time,
in
view
the
fact
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
resolve
this
matter
on
the
issue.
my
position
in
this
particular
matter
i
might
add
after
the
trial
terminated,
there
was
a
contempt
hearing.
tacon
received
the
sentence
for
five
to
five-and-a-half
years
in
the
arizona
state
penitentiary
by
this
judge
and
short
time
after
judgment
was
entered
and
sentence
was
passed,
he
filed
a,
he
directed
the
county
attorney
to
file
an
order
to
show
cause
ordering
tacon
to
show
cause
why
he
shouldn’t
be
held
in
contempt
for
failing
to
abide
by
the
court’s
order
appearing
at
the
time
specified
in
the
minute
entry.
that
was
my
fist
appearance
in
the
case
and
the
result
of
that
was
that
we
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
tacon
willfully
and
intentionally
absent
himself
from
the
jurisdiction
and
we
didn’t
get
into
the
constitutional
question
although
the
hearing
was
akin
to
the
issue
that’s
before
the
court
now.
the
trial
judge
after
hearing
all
of
the
evidence
took
the
matter
under
advisement
and
it
is
to
this
day
still
under
advisement.
he
never
did
rule
as
to
whether
or
not
tacon
was
held
or
should
be
held
in
contempt
for
his
willful
failure
to
appear.
he
did
state
and
i
might
add
--
state
virtuously
on
the
record
that
after
tacon,
at
the
close
of
the
hearing,
tacon
requested
to
make
a
statement
to
the
court
and
at
state
he
said,
“your
honor,
i
swore
to
you
that
i
intended
to
be
present
at
trial.
i
never
intended
to
absent
myself
and
i
swore
to
you
that
what
i’ve
told
you
is
the
truth.”
and
the
trial
judge
at
that
time
said.
“mr.
tacon,
i
can
assure
you
that
i’m
not
in
impress
one
bit
with
your
stated
intention
at
this
time”
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
we
took
the
appeal
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
it
was
on
that
language
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
that
the
trial
judge
apparently
felt
that
this
man
willfully,
intentionally
absent
himself
from
the
jurisdiction
and
did
not
voluntarily
waived
his
right
to
be
present
at
the
trial
and
they
used
that
language
as
to,
as
a
claim
that
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
again,
i
distinguished
that.
but
the
issue
says
--
well
it
wasn’t
presented
to
the
court
and
i
think
that
when
we’re
talking
about
a
finding
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes.
but
i
think
when
we’re
talking
about
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
question
of
waiver,
as
to
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right,
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
little
more
specificity
than
a
judge’s
reaction
to
the
witnesses’
testimony,
and
i
think
were
talking
about
in
fact
an
evidentiary
hearing,
that’s
what
this
court
has
always
mandated,
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
be
made
and
that
specific
findings
be
determined
by
the
court.
there
were
no
specific
findings
and
i
grant
the
court
that
perhaps
you
can
infer
what
the
findings
might
have
been
had
they
been
squarely
presented
to
the
court
but
there
were
no
such
findings
made
and
the
issue
was
never
squarely
presented
to
the
court
and
to
this
day,
there
is
no
issue
for
finding
the
fact
or
in
the
question
of
whether
anthony
tacon
voluntarily
appeared
or
voluntarily
failed
appearance,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
give
the
state
the
right
to
try
on
individual
absentia.
if
there’s
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
no
sir,
no,
i
think
what
the
state
can
do
at
that
time
is
start
extradite,
if
the
state
feels
that
there’s
no
other
alternative
in
this
matter,
then
i
think
they
can
extradite,
they
can
forfeit
the
bail,
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
he’ll
have
to
brought
back
under
compulsion
and
his
bail
is
going
to
be
forfeited
and
he
is
going
to
be
charged
with
bail
jumping
if
that
jurisdiction
is
a
bail
jumping
statute
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
the
traditional
function
but
they
can’t
extradite
under
those
circumstances
where
someone,
at
least
there’s
a
claim
or
finding
by
authority
that
someone
has
violated
his
bail
agreement.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
correct
and
the
reason
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
i
don’t
have
to.
i
can
be
successful
in
this
case
by
claiming
that
there
was
finding
of
fact
and
that
the
procedures
in
arizona
are
incompatible
with
the
constitution,
that
is
the
finding
should
be
made
at
the
termination
of
the
trial
and
not
such
finding
was
made
in
this
case
and
ask
the
court
to
return
this
case
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
finding
by
a
trial
judge,
that
to
me
is
not
satisfactory,
that
one
i
don’t
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
it’s
like
the
witness
that
perhaps
might
have
just
gone
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
el
reno
oklahoma,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
sir.
but
you
have
to
weigh
that
with
the
fact
that
the
probability
that
it
depends
not
going
to
receive
a
fair
trial
if
he’s
absent
and
that’s
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
if
a
person
uses
this
claim
of
poverty
as
a
subterfuge
to
avoid
returning
to
the
state,
i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
means
that
you
can
use
to
avoid
going
to
trial.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
but
it
doesn’t
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
this
person
shall
be
constitutionally
tried
in
absentia.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
other
way
to
obviate
that
--
resolve
that
problem
would
be
to
make
to
have
bail
restrictions,
restrict
the
individual
to
the
state,
that
would
be
in
other
way
of
resolving
that
problem
and
in
our
federal
court,
we’re
required,
defense
are
required
to
call
counsel
once
a
week
to
keep
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct
that
he
still
could
not
be
–--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
they
might
give
the
local
court
more
control
over
the
defendant
in
the
hopes
that
he
will
abide
by
that
bail
arrangement
but
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
done.
the
question
is
weighing
the
fact
of
trying
someone
in
absentia
in
this
particular
instance,
the
court-appointed
counsel
in
fact
in
most
instances,
the
court-appointed
counsel
without
that
individual
being
present
to
be
at
the
trial,
to
make
sure,
to
assure
that
there’s
integrity
in
that
trial
and
insure
that
court-appointed
counsel
does
his
job
as
opposed
to
the
state’s
policy
of
proceeding
with
the
trial
in
the
defendants
absence
and
in
so
weighing
i
think
it’s
a
matter
of
policy.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
sir.
we
don’t
have
any
provisions,
any
procedural
provisions
in
our
state
procedure
to
suppress
confessions
prior
to
trial.
you
can
suppress
unlawfully
obtained
evidence
but
as
far
as
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
concerned,
that
has
to
be
done
at
trial.
we
don’t
have
any
specific
rule
unless
the
trial
judge
grants
you
permission
to
have
that
done
prior
to
trouble.
we
don’t
have
any
rules
that
enable
that
to
be
done.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
it’s
not
really.
the
custom
is
to
do
it
at
the
time
of
trial.
i’ve
done
it
prior
to
trial
when
i’ve
made
special
arrangement
with
the
prosecutor
and
with
the
court
but
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no
sir.
no
it
wasn’t.
i
don’t
know
what
the
state
of
preparation
that
the
court-appointed
counsel
had
prior
to
the
commencement
of
trial
and
again
that’s
another
reason
to
my
mind
that
you
got
to
strike
the
balance
as
far
as
policy
is
concerned
and
i
think
the
better
one
is
in
favor
of
the
defendant
rather
than
in
favor
of
the,
facilitating
the
states
trial
of
an
individual
and
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
it
was
raised
before
the
arizona
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
the
latter
aspect
of
my
claim
today
was
raised.
i
would
tell
you
that
i
read
my
brief
and
i
believed
i
might
have
conceded
the
constitutional
validity
in
part
of
231
because
it
just
recently
been
ruled
upon
by
our
court
but
i
did
claim
that
the
procedures
used,
that
is
the
placing
the
burden
on
the
defendant
was
violative
of
his
constitutional
right
and
that
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
they
didn’t
answer
that
question
in
dealing
with
any,
affirm
the
least
the
implicit
finding
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
let
me
state
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
the
latter
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
the
latter
issue
as
to
the
waiver
aspect
and
the
constitutional
validity,
the
waiver
and
the
arizona
procedure
was
raised,
that
issue
was
raised
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
not
dealt
with.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
there
was
a
first
opportunity
i
had
to
raise
a
question
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
--
in
the
supreme
court
and
i
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
--i
had
no
opportunity
to
go
back
before
the
trial
of
the
trial
court
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
there
was
a
lawyer,
i
might
add,
he
might
have
said
something
to
that
effect
to
the,
in
the
transcript
of
record
but
i’d
have
to
go
back
(inaudible)
of
the
trial
proceedings
to
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
understand
that
and
i
just
can’t
answer
the
question
your
honor
as
to
whether
or
not
that
question
was
specifically
raised
by
mr.
whitney,
i
just
don’t
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
sir.
in
the
contempt
hearing
i
didn’t
raise
it
at
all
because
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes.
we
didn’t
raise
it
at
all,
it’s
concerned
with
that
narrow
issue
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
at
the,
as
far
as
the
trial
was
concerned.
i
just
don’t,
i
only
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
i’ve
gone
through
this
before
in
federal
habeas
corpus
and
the
judge
said,
“well
as
the
arizona
supreme
court
didn’t
deal
with
this
matter
and
you’re
therefore
precluded.”
then
i
said,
“well
the
issue
was
raised,
it’s
not
my
fault
that
they
didn’t
mentioned
it
in
the
opinion,
i
can’t
help
what
they
put
in
their
opinions.”
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
a
general
principle
of
law,
i
don’t,
that
i’ve
always
adhered
to
in
whether
that’s
a,
we
have
a
peculiar,
i’m
almost
certain
there
is
no
specific
statute
or
rule
to
that
effect
or
i
can’t
even
recall
reading
an
arizona
case
to
that
effect.
i
know
as
a
matter
of
practice
i
always
i
do
it
and
i
always
assume
that’s
based
on
case
law
and
it
sounds
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
sound
principles
of
law.
i
only
have
a
couple
of
minutes
and
i’d
like
to
tell
the
court
i
haven’t
got
around
advocating
my
position
and
my
position
is
one,
that
rule
231
is
unconstitutionally
valid
that
the
only
time
that
the
defendant
to
be
tried
in
absentia
would
be
one
where
he
expressly
consents
thereto
or
he
makes
an
express
waiver
prior
to
trial
or
under
a
rule
43
situation
that
is
where
he
appears
at
the
trial,
the
start
of
the
trial
and
thereafter
absconds
or
leaves
because
there
you
have
at
least
have
an
inference
that
he
consulted
with
counsel,
that
he
certainly
knew
about
the
trial,
that
he
was
ready
to
try
the
case
thereafter
leaves
for
disrupted
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that
would
be
my
position
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
i
think
this
court
has
so
held
if
you
read
the
line
of
cases,
the
up
through
diaz
and
it’s
always
been
the
position
of
this
court
that
the
position
is
embodied
in
rule
43
and
i
think
even
if
there
is
a
situation
where
he
absconds
after
he
is
present
in
the
first
day
of
trial,
i
think
there
still
has
to
be
a
later
determination
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
that
fellow
is
in
a
lot
of
trouble
too
because
he’s
not
only
going
to
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
as
i
say,
it’s
a
matter
of
policy
and
it’s
a
matter
of
policy
of
weighing
the
principle
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
it’s
a
vexatious
and
a
difficult
one.
i’m
puzzled
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
my
position
would
be
they
cannot
because
it’s
incompatible
with
the
constitution
with
the
defendant’s
right
necessity
be
present
at
the
trial
and
they
say
it’s
a
matter
of
striking
a
balance
and
i’m
puzzled
with
this
for
some
weeks
and
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
my
case,
i
haven’t
add
a
factor,
the
fact,
this
man
was
innocent
might
--
factually,
i
feel
that
he
didn’t
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
his
right
to
be
present
because
he
simply
didn’t
have
the
funds
to
appear
but
if
you
ask
me
hypothetically
if
there
is
any
difference
as
far
as
position,
i
would
take
there
would
be
no
difference.
and
my
alternative
position
if
you
reject
my
first,
the
one
i
just
stated
to
you
would
be
that
at
a
minimum,
if
you
reject
the
fact
and
agree
that
rule
231
is
valid,
i
might
tell
you
what
they’ve
done
on
rule
231
in
arizona.
there
was
a
recent
case
decided
by
our
supreme
court
that’s,
we
cited
state
versus
davis
was
decided
the
day
or
two
before
this
court
accepted
cert
in
my
petition
where
they
had
given
notice
to
the
defendant
and
he
wasn’t
seen
thereafter
and
he
was
tried
on
absentia
and
no
one
had
seen
him,
by
some
and
the
court-appointed
lawyer
and
he
was
convicted
and
i
don’t
recall
whether
he
sentenced.
and
that
case
was
affirmed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
apparently
as
it
set
a
rule
in
arizona
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
basis
of
my
case
had
taken.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
presumption
that
he
had
voluntarily
absent
himself
arose
as
a
result
of
him
being
given
notice
of
the
trial
date.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i’m
almost
certain
that
issue
was
raised,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
went
up,
it
was
certified
by
our
supreme
court,
the
special
procedure
we
have
in
arizona
and
i’m
almost
certain
the
constitutional
issue
was
raised
in
that
case.
that
again
rule
231
was
attacked
and
the
supreme
court
whether
they
answered
it
in
constitutional
terms
and
i
don’t
recall.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
it
was
raised
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
the
issue
was
raised
and
by
implication
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
by
implication
they
did
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
by
implication
they
decided
it
by
virtue
of
their
affirmance
because
the
issue
was
raised
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes.
well,
i
think
it’s
in
a
presumption
that
probably
shouldn’t
be
indulged
in.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
record.
certainly,
the
petitioner
should
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
petitioner
shouldn’t
be
penalized
because
the
appellate
bench
in
a
particular
state
doesn’t
resolve
a
question
that’s
otherwise
raised
by
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well,
that
wasn’t
why,
i’m
sure
that’s
wasn’t
why,
it
wasn’t
discussed
in
the
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
--
supreme
court
opinion,
the
matter
when
the
issue
was
raised
was
never
mentioned
and
never
brought
up
till,
i’m
sure
there
wasn’t
on
that
basis
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
no,
no,
i
couldn’t
say
why
the
issue
wasn’t
discussed
in
the
opinion,
maybe
perhaps
the
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
well
that
wasn’t
the
situation
here,
at
least
as
far
as
the
opinion
was
concerned.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
raised
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
as
far
as
getting
to
the
basic
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
i
don’t
believe
they
discussed
that
at
all.
well,
it
did,
they
did
a
little
to
it
in
one
or
two
sentences.
if
you
can
call
this
an
allusion
to
that,
my
claim
they
said
that
in
arizona
the
rule
is
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
the
defendant
is
given
notice
and
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
as
far
as
using
the
phrase,
this
is
constitutional
or
is
compatible
with
the
u.s.
constitution,
i
don’t
believe
they
did
but
they
say
it
by
implication,
the
–-
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
that’s
correct
your
honor,
in
fact
i
expressly
conceded
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
--
because
of
a
recently
decided
case
that
i
felt
that
i
couldn’t
get
anywhere
--
mr.
robert
j.
hirsh
and
in
retrospect,
i
see
that
was
mistake
and
should
have
been
attacked
at
time
because
i
see
some
real,
the
constitutional
impediments
to
not
only
the
rule
but
the
procedure
used.
