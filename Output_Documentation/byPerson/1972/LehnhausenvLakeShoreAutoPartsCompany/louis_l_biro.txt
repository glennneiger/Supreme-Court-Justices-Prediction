mr.
louis
l.
biro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
no
time
in
any
of
the
constitutional
history
of
the
state
of
illinois,
in
the
context
of
the
constitutions
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
either
the
laws
and/or
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
illinois
has
the
state
ever
recognized
a
tax
on
property
or
an
exemption
of
property
predicated
on
the
type
of
ownership
of
that
property.
now
obviously,
i
am
excluding
the
eleemosynary
corporations
etcetera.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
the
instant
cases
that
are
before
this
court
now
did
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
follow
the
same
principle
that
has
been
annunciated
throughout
the
judicial
history
of
our
state
during
that
time
and
that
is
that
to
be
valid,
the
classification
of
property
for
the
purposes
of
property
tax
imposition
or
exclusion
must
be
based
on
related
to
or
referred
to
the
differences
if
any
in
the
property
itself
or
the
characteristics
of
the
property
itself
and
in
one
instance
perhaps
even
the
form
of
the
property
itself.
and
in
order
to
find
any
support
under
the
law
and
particularly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
as
we
see
it,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
i
think
succinctly
touched
on
this
although
the
other
gentlemen
who
have
appeared
here
beforehand
do
not
seem
to
agree
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
attorney
general's
appendix
at
page
29,
there
is
a
quote
in
the
opinion
and
if
i
may
although
the
part
is
not
particularly
lengthy,
it's
a
very
short
section
that
i
have
taken
out
of
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
louis
l.
biro
justice
schaefer's
opinion,
yes
and
if
i
may
the
new
article
classifies
--
mr.
louis
l.
biro
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
l.
biro
page
29
of
the
attorney
general’s
appendix,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
louis
l.
biro
it's
in
the
hand
book
mr.
justice
–
not
referred
to
?
mr.
louis
l.
biro
yes
sir.
the
new
article
classifies
personal
property
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
a
property
tax
by
evaluation
upon
a
basis
that
does
not
depended
upon
any
of
the
characteristics
of
the
property
that
is
tax
or
upon
the
use
to
which
it
is
put,
but
solely
upon
the
ownership
of
the
property.
if
the
property
is
owned
by
a,
it's
taxable.
if
it's
owned
by
b,
it
cannot
be
a
taxed.
of
course
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
classification.
an
absolute
precision
is
not
required
of
the
states
in
drawing
the
lines
between
classes.
nevertheless,
a
state
may
not
under
the
guise
of
classification,
arbitrarily
discriminate
against
one
and
in
favor
of
another
similarly
situated
and
i
respectfully
point
out
that
the
question
was
asked
before
about
differences
that
might
appear
in
other
states.
and
the
question
as
to
has
not
the
question
come
up
before
of
distinctions
that
were
in
here
and
i
think
the
word
guise
is
probably
the
most
important
word
in
the
later
part
of
mr.
justice
schaefer's
words
here.
because
of
the
fact
that
what
has
happened
here
is
that
there
is
no
doubt,
but
that
the
sovereign
state
has
gotten
itself
into
one
horrendous
morass
that
it
cannot
find
--
could
not
find
a
way
to
extradite
itself
from.
i
respectfully
point
out
as
an
attorney,
as
an
officer
of
the
court
that
i
certainly
as
the
citizen
of
the
state
have
compassion
and
have
an
understanding,
as
a
parent
i
understand
the
need
for
money,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
judicial
approach
to
say
that
the
ends
justify
the
means
and
regardless
of
what
the
problem
is
certainly
the
courts
of
this
land
have
to
face
up
to
the
approach
that
was
taken
and
if
the
approach
that
was
taken
is
not
proper
then
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
courts
to
take
the
unpopular,
if
you
will,
position
to
say
that
we
must
look
at
it
the
way
it
is.
in
effect
with
article
ix
did,
is
to
place
the
property
itself
on
one
side
and
say
that
the
type
of
ownership
is
really
going
to
be
the
criterion
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
what
they
are
talking
about
is
a
privilege
tax.
this
is
not
a
property
tax
if
you
do
it
this
way.
you
are
taking
a
privilege
to
act
and
you
are
putting
it
in.
now
as
i
stated,
the
illinois
constitution
of
1870,
the
illinois
constitution
of
1970
contains
in
its
revenue
articles
no
word
that
has
the
spelling
out
of
the
word
individual.
the
illinois
revenue
act
of
1939,
the
word
individual
does
not
appear.
that
designation
appears
i
respectfully
submit
for
the
first
time
in
article
ix
(a)
which
is
the
article
that
comes
before
this
and
seeks
to
prohibit
a
taxation
that
is
nowhere
actually
imposed
because
if
you
read
our
constitution
and
you
read
our
revenue
act
there
is
no
place
where
it
says
a
“individual
shall
pay
this
tax
or
an
individual
shall
pay
that
tax.”
with
due
deference
to
mr.
kaplan
who
pointed
that
out
to
this
court
that
it
is
accepted
among
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
that
the
word
individual
has
a
specific
meaning.
i
stand
before
this
court
and
tell
you
that
this
is
one
member
of
bar
who
does
not
know
what
individual
means.
i
do
not
find
it
in
our
statute.
i
do
not
find
it
in
our
constitution
and
suddenly
for
the
first
time
there
is
language
that
says
that
was
given
to
the
elector,
if
you
will,
that
individual
shall
be
exempt.
now
article
ix(a)
purports
to
prohibit
the
taxation
of
personal
property
by
evaluation,
by
as
to
individuals.
nowhere
in
all
of
article
ix
does
the
word
individual
appear.
nowhere
in
the
revenue
act
of
1939
does
the
word
individual
appear.
nowhere
does
article
ix
imposed
a
tax
by
evaluation,
i
am
individual
and
the
illinois
constitution
does
not
direct
that
any
tax
shall
be
levied
on
an
individual.
corporations
and
m.
weil
&
sons,
i
can't
speak
obviously
you
heard,
mr.
flamm,
he
is
not
in
accord
with
me,
m.
weil
&
sons
respectfully
submit
that
unless
the
exclusion
of
article
ix
(a)
applies
to
us
also,
i
am
speaking
of
corporations,
i
don't
what
an
individual
is,
i
don't
know
where
the
distinction
comes.
mr.
louis
l.
biro
it
purports
the
answer
it,
it
obviously
and
so
far
as
the
court
is
concerned.
i
am
respectfully
pointing
out
that
in
my
brief
i
point
out
to
this
court
that
i
take
issue
with
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
was
raised
in
that.
mr.
louis
l.
biro
i
unfortunately
came
here
(voice
overlap)
your
honor
and
for
that
reason
i
touched
on
it
in
my
brief
only
to
the
extent
that
i
felt
that
it
should
be
brought
to
this
court's
attention.
mr.
louis
l.
biro
evidently,
evidently.
i
am
assuming
that
from
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
stated
in
this
case
that
in
effect
we
are
back
to
exactly
the
same
taxing
procedure
that
we
were
at
prior
to
the
time
that
the
question
was
raised
in
these
cases
before
that
court.
so
that
mr.
flamm
states
that
he
doesn't
understand
why
i
appeared
here.
unfortunately,
we
attorneys
professionally
or
maybe
as
fortunately
obviously
cannot
always
see
all
issues
the
same
way
with
due
respect
to
this
court.
i
notice
that
there
are
“split
decisions”
that
come
down.
it
was
my
feeling
that
in
the
case.
it
was
brought
up
initially
that
my
client’s
interests
were
not
adequately
protected.
it's
also
my
feeling
that
i
hear
figures
thrown
around
constantly
as
to
how
much
money
is
collected
in
cook
county
and
unfortunately
in
a
state
such
as
ours
we
tend
to
be
two
states
when
people
talk
about
us
because
we
have
the
same
difficulty
that
the
state
of
new
york
seems
to
have
up
state,
down
state
and
a
large
metropolitan
area
and
the
rest
of
the
state
and
obviously
to
a
great
extent,
the
southern
part
of
our
state
is
the
agricultural
basis
as
a
result
of
that
one
figures
or
put
out
as
to
what
money
is
collected
and
what
money
is
not
collected.
it's
my
feeling
that
if
there
was
an
unconstitutional
attempt
made
here
and
if
my
client,
my
corporate
entity
if
you
will
was
going
to
be
put
in
the
position
where
it
was
going
to
be
forced
to
pick
up
part
of
the
slack
that
was
brought
because
of
improper
action
regardless
of
what
amount
of
money
that
would
be
saved
by
it,
i
felt
that
i
was
adequately
improperly
representing
my
client
in
following
through
on
that.
i
state
only
that
we
get
down
to
a
basic
question
if
the
court
please
that
article
ix
(a)
is
constitutionally
offensive.
i
feel
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
should
so
affirm.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
l.
biro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
no
time
in
any
of
the
constitutional
history
of
the
state
of
illinois,
in
the
context
of
the
constitutions
of
the

of

in

of

now
obviously,
i
am

the
eleemosynary

etcetera.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
the
instant
cases
that
are
before
this
court
now
did
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
follow
the

that

the

i

if

if
i

it's

biro
it's
in

mr.

–
not

mr.
louis

yes

the
new

classifies
personal

for
the

of

that

but

of
the

if
the
property
is
owned
by
a,
it's
taxable.
if
it's
owned
by
b,
it
cannot
be
a
taxed.
of
course
the
equal

clause
of
the
fourteenth

does
not
prohibit
classification.
an
absolute
precision
is
not
required
of
the
states
in

the
lines

nevertheless,
a
state
may
not
under
the
guise
of
classification,
arbitrarily
discriminate
against
one
and
in
favor
of
another
similarly
situated
and
i
respectfully
point
out
that
the
question
was
asked
before
about
differences
that
might
appear
in
other
states.
and
the
question
as
to
has
not
the

i

the
word
guise
is
probably
the
most
important

here.
because
of
the
fact
that

here
is
that

that

if

you
are

now
as
i

the

i
point
out
to
this
court
that
i
take
issue
with
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
was
raised
in
that.
mr.
louis
l.
biro
i
unfortunately
came
here
(voice
overlap)
your
honor
and
for
that
reason
i
touched
on
it
in
my
brief
only
to
the
extent
that
i
felt
that
it
should
be
brought
to
this
court's
attention.
mr.
louis
l.
biro
evidently,
evidently.
i
am
assuming
that
from
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
stated
in
this
case
that
in
effect
we
are
back
to
exactly
the
same
taxing
procedure
that
we
were
at
prior
to
the
time
that
the
question
was
raised
in
these
cases
before
that
court.
so
that
mr.
flamm
states
that
he
doesn't
understand
why
i
appeared
here.
unfortunately,
we
attorneys
professionally
or
maybe
as
fortunately
obviously
cannot
always
see
all
issues
the
same
way
with
due
respect
to
this
court.
i
notice
that
there
are
“split
decisions”
that
come
down.
it
was
my
feeling
that
in
the
case.
it
was
brought
up
initially
that
my
client’s
interests
were
not
adequately
protected.
it's
also
my
feeling
that
i
hear
figures
thrown
around
constantly
as
to
how
much
money
is
collected
in
cook
county
and
unfortunately
in
a
state
such
as
ours
we
tend
to
be
two
states
when
people
talk
about
us
because
we
have
the
same
difficulty
that
the
state
of
new
york
seems
to
have
up
state,
down
state
and
a
large
metropolitan
area
and
the
rest
of
the
state
and
obviously
to
a
great
extent,
the
southern
part
of
our
state
is
the
agricultural
basis
as
a
result
of
that
one
figures
or
put
out
as
to
what
money
is
collected
and
what
money
is
not
collected.
it's
my
feeling
that
if
there
was
an
unconstitutional
attempt
made
here
and
if
my
client,
my
corporate
entity
if
you
will
was
going
to
be
put
in
the
position
where
it
was
going
to
be
forced
to
pick
up
part
of
the
slack
that
was
brought
because
of
improper
action
regardless
of
what
amount
of
money
that
would
be
saved
by
it,
i
felt
that
i
was
adequately
improperly
representing
my
client
in
following
through
on
that.
i
state
only
that
we
get
down
to
a
basic
question
if
the
court
please
that
article
ix
(a)
is
constitutionally
offensive.
i
feel
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
should
so
affirm.
thank
you.
