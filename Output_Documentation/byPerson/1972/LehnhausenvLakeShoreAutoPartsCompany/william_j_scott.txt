mr.
william
j.
scott
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
cases
for
the
court
this
morning
involve
the
legitimate
and
reasonable
attempt
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
bring
in
our
cake
an
unworkable
tax
structure,
into
accordance
with
the
problems
of
our
modern
day
society
and
bring
a
taxing
system
that
was
based
in
the
time
when
illinois
was
an
agricultural
state
over
hundred
years
ago
in
the
line
with
the
concepts
of
today
when
we
were
one
of
the
largest
industrial
states
in
the
nation.
the
tax
under
consideration
was
the
personal
property
tax
which
is
unworkable,
unjust
and
unfair
to
the
people
of
our
state.
now
its
administration
it
varied
completely
throughout
the
state.
the
bulk
of
the
funds
came
from
the
assessments
and
corporations
that
were
easy
to
ascertain
and
easy
to
enforce
due
to
the
fact
that
we
could
dissolve
the
corporation
if
they
failed
to
file
their
papers
and
to
pay
their
taxes.
the
tax
in
individuals
was
administered
variously
throughout
102
different
counties.
one
example
of
the
discrepancy
was
that
the
downstate
agricultural
community,
the
individuals
paid
$27
million
in
1970,
and
in
the
industrial
areas
of
chicago,
it
was
less
than
$2
million.
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
ascertain
the
intangibles
and
then
some
of
the
means
of
assessing
they
took
into
consideration
that
to
tax
it
at
the
full
rate
would
be
almost
a
confiscation
of
the
property.
for
that
reason,
the
legislature,
the
elected
officials
and
the
members
of
the
delegation
to
the
new
constitutional
convention
all
strived
to
develop
an
orderly
way
of
phasing
out
this
tax.
along
with
that
proposition,
the
legislatures
of
the
state
in
1969
also
voted
to
impose
the
state
income
tax
in
the
state
for
the
first
time.
that
income
tax
was
held
constitutional
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
difference
in
classification
of
the
tax
rate
for
corporations
and
individuals.
during
that
same
year,
the
legislature
by
a
joint
resolution
of
the
senate
and
the
house
overwhelmingly
placed
a
referendum
before
the
people
of
the
state,
stating
that
the
new
order
to
be
adopted
by
the
people
would
eliminate
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
individuals.
that
resolution
was
adopted
overwhelmingly,
somewhere
between
seven
and
eight
out
of
every
person
in
the
state
voted
for
it.
the
new
constitution
took
this
into
consideration
of
an
orderly
phase
out
of
the
personal
property
tax,
and
they
provided
that
for
any
tax
that
was
eliminated
before
january
1,
1971
that
there
could
be
no
new
tax
placed
on
this
substitute
for
it,
realizing
that
this
had
been
the
main
purpose
of
our
state
income
tax
and
that
the
budgets
of
the
local
school
districts
and
local
governments
had
been
determined
accordingly.
however,
with
the
desire
to
completely
phase
out
the
personal
property
tax
by
1979,
the
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention
provided
that
any
taxes
that
were
eliminated
on
personal
property
after
january
1,
1971,
or
in
other
words,
the
day
after
this
constitutional
amendment,
the
1870
constitution
would
have
become
effective,
would
have
to
be
replaced
by
a
substitute
source
of
revenue
on
that
same
source.
so
we
are
talking
about
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
meaningful
tax
relief
for
the
individual
citizens
of
illinois
as
was
designated
by
the
legislature,
by
their
elected
officials,
by
their
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention
in
line
with
the
will
of
the
people
of
the
state.
in
the
case
at
hand,
the
lake
shore
auto
parts
corporation
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
the
revenue
article
providing
for
the
personal
property
tax,
saying
that
by
virtue
of
the
amendment
to
the
1870
constitution,
the
revenue
article
became
unconstitutional,
claiming
that
it
violated
the
federal
constitution
and
equal
protection
of
law.
faced
with
that
possibility,
that
the
revenue
article
would
be
unconstitutional
and
that
over
$300
million
worth
of
finances
every
year
would
be
lost
to
the
school
district,
resulting
in
a
complete
chaos
in
our
local
government,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
ruled
that
the
revenue
article
was
not
unconstitutional
because
of
the
amendment,
but
went
on
to
rule
that
the
amendment
to
the
constitution
was
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution.
in
doing
so,
they
reacted
without
the
consideration
of
the
existing
fact
that
a
new
constitution
had
been
adopted
by
delegates
representing
people
of
the
state
and
had
been
adopted
by
the
people
of
the
state.
now
that
constitution
specifically
recognized
the
facts
involved
in
the
article
9
amendments
to
the
previous
constitution
and
provided
for
a
complete
phasing
out
of
the
personal
property
tax.
as
a
matter
of
fact
new
constitution
also
placed
on
the
state
for
the
first
time
in
history,
the
responsibility
for
the
primary
funding
of
education
in
the
state
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
modernize
our
whole
taxing
structure
and
to
deal
with
the
responsibilities
of
government.
that
under
this
reasonable
scheme
it
was
designed
to
remove
the
tax
first
from
the
people
that
have
been
treated
most
unjustly,
and
then
do
systematically
remove
the
tax
completely
and
that
the
responsibility
of
financing
schools
and
local
governments
would
be
met
by
other
form
such
as
our
new
state
income
tax
and
based
on
the
constitutional
obligation
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
education
in
the
state
now
became
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes,
what
had
happened
was
that
in
1970,
the
state
convened
a
constitutional
convention,
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
hundred
years
revised
our
constitution
completely.
in
that
constitution,
the
delegates
specifically
took
notice
of
this
problem
that
we
had
in
the
personal
property
tax
and
provided
for
a
phasing
out
completely
of
the
personal
property
tax
by
1979.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that's
actually
written
into
the
new
constitution.
mr.
william
j.
scott
it
will
automatically
become
effective
and
the
provision
realizing
that
a
great
deal
of
the
financial
support
of
our
school
system
was
based
on
the
personal
property
tax
and
by
far
the
bulk
of
it
based
on
the
personal
property
tax
and
corporations.
mr.
william
j.
scott
the
total
tax
now
is
somewhere
in
the
nature
of
$350
million.
mr.
william
j.
scott
only
by
personal
property
--
of
that
amount
somewhere
between
$50
and
75
million
of
it
comes
from
the
individuals.
mr.
william
j.
scott
and
approximately
$300
million
of
it
comes
from
the
corporations.
mr.
william
j.
scott
back
in
1970,
we
were
talking
about
$300
million
for
the
total
package.
mr.
william
j.
scott
it
was
against
the
individuals
which
is
done
by
an
amendment
to
the
old
constitution
at
the
time
the
state
income
tax
went
into
effect.
mr.
william
j.
scott
the
next
step
was
a
convening
of
a
new
constitutional
convention
which
provided
that
any
other
taxes
that
hadn't
gone
into
effect
as
of
the
effective
date
of
that
amendment,
january
1,
1971
that
any
other
taxes
would
be
phased
out
no
later
than
1979.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that
was
our
contention.
any
other
is
against
individual,
is
what
they
specified
and
of
course,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
this
case
had
indicated
that
the
distinction
between
individuals
and
corporations
which
is
one
of
the
points
under
consideration
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes.
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes
we
do.
we
have
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
j.
scott
and
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
page
four
on
the
footnote.
that
on
or
before
january
1,
1979,
the
general
assembly
shall
abolish
all
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
and
concurrently
therewith
and
thereafter
shall
replace
all
revenue
lost
by
units
of
local
government
and
school
districts
as
a
result
of
the
abolition
of
the
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
subsequent
to
january
2,
1971,
taking
into
cognizance
since
the
fact
that
on
january
1
of
1971
under
the
article
ix-a
amendment
to
the
old
constitution
that
the
tax
in
individuals
would
have
been
eliminated.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that’s
right,
the
--
it
would
require
that
the
legislature
orderly
phase
it
on
and
replace
it.
any
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
well,
then
we
would
have
complete
chaos
and
then
we
would
have
lost
the
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
well,
it
would
have
left
us
in
the
situation
that
we
would
be
in
today
if
the
arguments
in
the
lake
shore
auto
parts
corporations
upheld
that
we
would
have
no
source
of
revenue
for
financing
the
state,
the
practical
numbers
here
for
example.
for
the
taxes
of
70,
71,
72,
that
are
under
consideration
is
of
billion
dollars.
and
so
that
its
the
financing
of
the
school
districts
of
our
state.
mr.
william
j.
scott
the
most
important
factor
that
happened
and
i
think
that
it
should
be
recognized
by
this
court
and
was
not
involved
in
the
majority
of
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
is
that
the
state
for
the
first
time
in
history
did
pass
an
income
tax,
to
give
us
a
source
of
revenue.
and
that
that
went
into,
has
gone
into
effect
and
that
there
is
the
distinction,
they
are
4%
rate
on
corporations
and
a
2.5%
rate
on
individuals.
and
what
this
provision
in
the
constitution
is
saying
is
that,
when
you
do
take
off
the
tax
as
to
corporations,
that
there
has
to
be
some
type
of
compensating
state
wide
tax
other
than
the
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
well
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
it
is
the
vehicle
that
now
exists
for
the
first
time.
for
a
hundred
of
years
it
has
withheld
that
we
could
not
an
income
tax
and
we
presented
the
case
in
1969
to
the
supreme
court
and
due
the
fact
that
the
economics
and
the
structure
that
stated
change
they
reversed
themselves
and
ruled
that
it
was
constitutional
to
have
an
income
tax
in
illinois
and
also,
that
is
was
constitutional
to
make
a
differential
in
the
classifications
between
corporations
and
individuals,
which
is
the
basis
that
the
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention
we
are
operating
on.
and
that
the
whole
program
was
an
orderly
and
designed
one
to
change
our
method
of
financing
to
even
more
equitable
and
realistic
one
for
the
state.
mr.
william
j.
scott
but
it
varied
throughout
the
state.
the
farmer,
of
course,
was
faced
with
the
problem
that
his
tractor
was
sitting
there
in
the
field
that
was
enforceable,
the
assessor
could
see
it.
the
vast
bulk
of
the
holdings
in
the
state
of
course,
as
far
as
individuals
would
come
in
stocks
and
then
bank
accounts
that
could
be
shifted
out
to
the
state.
and
so
that
the
problem
that
the
enforcing
officers
had
was
that
to
go
in
on
a
assessment
of
an
individual
on
his
automobile
for
example,
it
would
cost
more
in
a
court
case,
they
collected
than
the
tax
was.
mr.
william
j.
scott
well,
as
i
mentioned,
in
our
income
tax
case,
our
own
supreme
court
took
cognizance
of
a
number
of
cases
that
had
existed
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court
that
said
that
it
is
possible
to
classify
as
to
ownership,
that
it
is
possible
to
do
that
in
a
property
tax
case.
such
as
in
the
allied
stores
case
of
ohio
which
came
after
the
quaker
city
cab
case
which
was
in
1959,
in
the
most
recent
cases,
which
permitted
classification
of
property
tax
proposed
on
the
basis
of
identity
of
the
owner.
at
the
time
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
upheld
the
distinction
between
the
corporations
and
individuals
in
the
income
tax,
they
referred
to
other
cases
such
as
lawrence
versus
mississippi,
where
justice
stone
who
was
one
of
the
distinguished
dissenting
judges
in
the
quaker
city
cab
case
along
with
justice
brandeis
and
justice
holmes.
justice
stone
said,
“states
have
unrestricted
power
to
tax
those
domicile
within
them,
so
long
as
that
tax
is
imposed
to
put
upon
property
within
the
state
or
privileges
enjoyed
there
and
that
it
is
not
arbitrary
or
unreasonable.”
in
this
case,
it
was
the
state
income
tax
reliving
domestic
corporations
but
not
ones
from
outside
the
state
on
income
from
activities
carried
on
outside
of
the
state
and
this
was
held
not
to
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
there
have
been
many
cases
that
permit
the
state
to
single
out
property
of
corporation
and
subject
it
to
taxation,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
illinois
constitution,
the
illinois
statutes,
the
illinois
law,
the
federal
constitution,
the
federal
law,
does
permit
our
state
to
single
out
property
of
the
corporation
and
subject
it
with
taxation
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others.
that
in
doing
so,
that
the
legislature
reflected
the
will
of
the
people
of
the
state
and
i
respectfully
ask
the
support
to
take
this
into
consideration,
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that’s
right
and
so
that
the
incentive
of
course,
on
the
legislature
is
that
we
would
have
no
way
of
replacing
this
tremendous
volume
of
revenue
for
our
school
district.
so
it’s
inconceivable
that
having
gone
through
the
anguish
of
placing
the
income
tax
on
the
state
that
the
legislature
would
do
nothing
to
finance
the
schools.
certainly,
the
whole
attempt
here
is
to
have
a
responsible
and
reasonable
approach
to
this
tremendous
problem
of
financing
local
government
and
specifically
the
schools
of
our
state.
mr.
william
j.
scott
it
would
violate
the
illinois
constitution.
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that’s
my
interpretation
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
well,
i
think
one
of
the
important
factors
of
this
case
is
that
all
of
the
states
like
illinois
are
going
through
this
transition.
48
out
of
50
states
do
have
some
type
of
a
personal
property
tax.
ours
of
course
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
we
had
a
very
real
problem.
remember
amending
our
constitution
took
us
a
100
years
to
get
it
done?
mr.
william
j.
scott
no,
i
don’t.
generally
speaking,
the
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
thank
you.
the
chief
of
our
appellate
division
died
of
a
heart
attack.
he
had
been
the
person
who
had
been
handling
this
case
and
that
without
the
benefit
of
his
consultation,
it
may
well
be
that
we
are
overlooking.
mr.
william
j.
scott
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
cases
for
the
court
this
morning
involve
the
legitimate
and
reasonable
attempt
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
bring
in
our
cake
an
unworkable
tax
structure,
into
accordance
with
the
problems
of
our
modern
day
society
and
bring
a
taxing
system
that
was
based
in
the
time
when
illinois
was
an
agricultural
state
over
hundred
years
ago
in
the
line
with
the
concepts
of
today
when
we
were
one
of
the
largest
industrial
states
in
the
nation.
the
tax
under
consideration
was
the
personal
property
tax
which
is
unworkable,
unjust
and
unfair
to
the
people
of
our
state.
now
its
administration
it
varied
completely
throughout
the
state.
the
bulk
of
the
funds
came
from
the
assessments
and
corporations
that
were
easy
to
ascertain
and
easy
to
enforce
due
to
the
fact
that
we
could
dissolve
the
corporation
if
they
failed
to
file
their
papers
and
to
pay
their
taxes.
the
tax
in
individuals
was
administered
variously
throughout
102
different
counties.
one
example
of
the
discrepancy
was
that
the
downstate
agricultural
community,
the
individuals
paid
$27
million
in
1970,
and
in
the
industrial
areas
of
chicago,
it
was
less
than
$2
million.
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
ascertain
the
intangibles
and
then
some
of
the
means
of
assessing
they
took
into
consideration
that
to
tax
it
at
the
full
rate
would
be
almost
a
confiscation
of
the
property.
for
that
reason,
the
legislature,
the
elected
officials
and
the
members
of
the
delegation
to
the
new
constitutional
convention
all
strived
to
develop
an
orderly
way
of
phasing
out
this
tax.
along
with
that
proposition,
the
legislatures
of
the
state
in
1969
also
voted
to
impose
the
state
income
tax
in
the
state
for
the
first
time.
that
income
tax
was
held
constitutional
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
difference
in
classification
of
the
tax
rate
for
corporations
and
individuals.
during
that
same
year,
the
legislature
by
a
joint
resolution
of
the
senate
and
the
house
overwhelmingly
placed
a
referendum
before
the
people
of
the
state,
stating
that
the
new
order
to
be
adopted
by
the
people
would
eliminate
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
individuals.
that
resolution
was
adopted
overwhelmingly,
somewhere
between
seven
and
eight
out
of
every
person
in
the
state
voted
for
it.
the
new
constitution
took
this
into
consideration
of
an
orderly
phase
out
of
the
personal
property
tax,
and
they
provided
that
for
any
tax
that
was
eliminated
before
january
1,
1971
that
there
could
be
no
new
tax
placed
on
this
substitute
for
it,
realizing
that
this
had
been
the
main
purpose
of
our
state
income
tax
and
that
the
budgets
of
the
local
school
districts
and
local
governments
had
been
determined
accordingly.
however,
with
the
desire
to
completely
phase
out
the
personal
property
tax
by
1979,
the
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention
provided
that
any
taxes
that
were
eliminated
on
personal
property
after
january
1,
1971,
or
in
other
words,
the
day
after
this
constitutional
amendment,
the
1870
constitution
would
have
become
effective,
would
have
to
be
replaced
by
a
substitute
source
of
revenue
on
that
same
source.
so
we
are
talking
about
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
meaningful
tax
relief
for
the
individual
citizens
of
illinois
as
was
designated
by
the
legislature,
by
their
elected
officials,
by
their
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention
in
line
with
the
will
of
the
people
of
the
state.
in
the
case
at
hand,
the
lake
shore
auto
parts
corporation
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
the
revenue
article
providing
for
the
personal
property
tax,
saying
that
by
virtue
of
the
amendment
to
the
1870
constitution,
the
revenue
article
became
unconstitutional,
claiming
that
it
violated
the
federal
constitution
and
equal
protection
of
law.
faced
with
that
possibility,
that
the
revenue
article
would
be
unconstitutional
and
that
over
$300
million
worth
of
finances
every
year
would
be
lost
to
the
school
district,
resulting
in
a
complete
chaos
in
our
local
government,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
ruled
that
the
revenue
article
was
not
unconstitutional
because
of
the
amendment,
but
went
on
to
rule
that
the
amendment
to
the
constitution
was
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution.
in
doing
so,
they
reacted
without
the
consideration
of
the
existing
fact
that
a
new
constitution
had
been
adopted
by
delegates
representing
people
of
the
state
and
had
been
adopted
by
the
people
of
the
state.
now
that
constitution
specifically
recognized
the
facts
involved
in
the
article
9
amendments
to
the
previous
constitution
and
provided
for
a
complete
phasing
out
of
the
personal
property
tax.
as
a
matter
of
fact
new
constitution
also
placed
on
the
state
for
the
first
time
in
history,
the
responsibility
for
the
primary
funding
of
education
in
the
state
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
modernize
our
whole
taxing
structure
and
to
deal
with
the
responsibilities
of
government.
that
under
this
reasonable
scheme
it
was
designed
to
remove
the
tax
first
from
the
people
that
have
been
treated
most
unjustly,
and
then
do
systematically
remove
the
tax
completely
and
that
the
responsibility
of
financing
schools
and
local
governments
would
be
met
by
other
form
such
as
our
new
state
income
tax
and
based
on
the
constitutional
obligation
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
education
in
the
state
now
became
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes,
what
had
happened
was
that
in
1970,
the
state
convened
a
constitutional
convention,
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
hundred
years
revised
our
constitution
completely.
in
that
constitution,
the
delegates
specifically
took
notice
of
this
problem
that
we
had
in
the
personal
property
tax
and
provided
for
a
phasing
out
completely
of
the
personal
property
tax
by
1979.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that's
actually
written
into
the
new
constitution.
mr.
william
j.
scott
it
will
automatically
become
effective
and
the
provision
realizing
that
a
great
deal
of
the
financial
support
of
our
school
system
was
based
on
the
personal
property
tax
and
by
far
the
bulk
of
it
based
on
the
personal
property
tax
and
corporations.
mr.
william
j.
scott
the
total
tax
now
is
somewhere
in
the
nature
of
$350
million.
mr.
william
j.
scott
only
by
personal
property
--
of
that
amount
somewhere
between
$50
and
75
million
of
it
comes
from
the
individuals.
mr.
william
j.
scott
and
approximately
$300
million
of
it
comes
from
the
corporations.
mr.
william
j.
scott
back
in
1970,
we
were
talking
about
$300
million
for
the
total
package.
mr.
william
j.
scott
it
was
against
the
individuals
which
is
done
by
an
amendment
to
the
old
constitution
at
the
time
the
state
income
tax
went
into
effect.
mr.
william
j.
scott
the
next
step
was
a
convening
of
a
new
constitutional
convention
which
provided
that
any
other
taxes
that
hadn't
gone
into
effect
as
of
the
effective
date
of
that
amendment,
january
1,
1971
that
any
other
taxes
would
be
phased
out
no
later
than
1979.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that
was
our
contention.
any
other
is
against
individual,
is
what
they
specified
and
of
course,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
this
case
had
indicated
that
the
distinction
between
individuals
and
corporations
which
is
one
of
the
points
under
consideration
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes.
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes
we
do.
we
have
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
j.
scott
and
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
page
four
on
the
footnote.
that
on
or
before
january
1,
1979,
the
general
assembly
shall
abolish
all
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
and
concurrently
therewith
and
thereafter
shall
replace
all
revenue
lost
by
units
of
local
government
and
school
districts
as
a
result
of
the
abolition
of
the
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
subsequent
to
january
2,
1971,
taking
into
cognizance
since
the
fact
that
on
january
1
of
1971
under
the
article
ix-a
amendment
to
the
old
constitution
that
the
tax
in
individuals
would
have
been
eliminated.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that’s
right,
the
--
it
would
require
that
the
legislature
orderly
phase
it
on
and
replace
it.
any
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
well,
then
we
would
have
complete
chaos
and
then
we
would
have
lost
the
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
well,
it
would
have
left
us
in
the
situation
that
we
would
be
in
today
if
the
arguments
in
the
lake
shore
auto
parts
corporations
upheld
that
we
would
have
no
source
of
revenue
for
financing
the
state,
the
practical
numbers
here
for
example.
for
the
taxes
of
70,
71,
72,
that
are
under
consideration
is
of
billion
dollars.
and
so
that
its
the
financing
of
the
school
districts
of
our
state.
mr.
william
j.
scott
the
most
important
factor
that
happened
and
i
think
that
it
should
be
recognized
by
this
court
and
was
not
involved
in
the
majority
of
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
is
that
the
state
for
the
first
time
in
history
did
pass
an
income
tax,
to
give
us
a
source
of
revenue.
and
that
that
went
into,
has
gone
into
effect
and
that
there
is
the
distinction,
they
are
4%
rate
on
corporations
and
a
2.5%
rate
on
individuals.
and
what
this
provision
in
the
constitution
is
saying
is
that,
when
you
do
take
off
the
tax
as
to
corporations,
that
there
has
to
be
some
type
of
compensating
state
wide
tax
other
than
the
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
well
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
it
is
the
vehicle
that
now
exists
for
the
first
time.
for
a
hundred
of
years
it
has
withheld
that
we
could
not
an
income
tax
and
we
presented
the
case
in
1969
to
the
supreme
court
and
due
the
fact
that
the
economics
and
the
structure
that
stated
change
they
reversed
themselves
and
ruled
that
it
was
constitutional
to
have
an
income
tax
in
illinois
and
also,
that
is
was
constitutional
to
make
a
differential
in
the
classifications
between
corporations
and
individuals,
which
is
the
basis
that
the
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention
we
are
operating
on.
and
that
the
whole
program
was
an
orderly
and
designed
one
to
change
our
method
of
financing
to
even
more
equitable
and
realistic
one
for
the
state.
mr.
william
j.
scott
but
it
varied
throughout
the
state.
the
farmer,
of
course,
was
faced
with
the
problem
that
his
tractor
was
sitting
there
in
the
field
that
was
enforceable,
the
assessor
could
see
it.
the
vast
bulk
of
the
holdings
in
the
state
of
course,
as
far
as
individuals
would
come
in
stocks
and
then
bank
accounts
that
could
be
shifted
out
to
the
state.
and
so
that
the
problem
that
the
enforcing
officers
had
was
that
to
go
in
on
a
assessment
of
an
individual
on
his
automobile
for
example,
it
would
cost
more
in
a
court
case,
they
collected
than
the
tax
was.
mr.
william
j.
scott
well,
as
i
mentioned,
in
our
income
tax
case,
our
own
supreme
court
took
cognizance
of
a
number
of
cases
that
had
existed
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court
that
said
that
it
is
possible
to
classify
as
to
ownership,
that
it
is
possible
to
do
that
in
a
property
tax
case.
such
as
in
the
allied
stores
case
of
ohio
which
came
after
the
quaker
city
cab
case
which
was
in
1959,
in
the
most
recent
cases,
which
permitted
classification
of
property
tax
proposed
on
the
basis
of
identity
of
the
owner.
at
the
time
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
upheld
the
distinction
between
the
corporations
and
individuals
in
the
income
tax,
they
referred
to
other
cases
such
as
lawrence
versus
mississippi,
where
justice
stone
who
was
one
of
the
distinguished
dissenting
judges
in
the
quaker
city
cab
case
along
with
justice
brandeis
and
justice
holmes.
justice
stone
said,
“states
have
unrestricted
power
to
tax
those
domicile
within
them,
so
long
as
that
tax
is
imposed
to
put
upon
property
within
the
state
or
privileges
enjoyed
there
and
that
it
is
not
arbitrary
or
unreasonable.”
in
this
case,
it
was
the
state
income
tax
reliving
domestic
corporations
but
not
ones
from
outside
the
state
on
income
from
activities
carried
on
outside
of
the
state
and
this
was
held
not
to
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
there
have
been
many
cases
that
permit
the
state
to
single
out
property
of
corporation
and
subject
it
to
taxation,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
illinois
constitution,
the
illinois
statutes,
the
illinois
law,
the
federal
constitution,
the
federal
law,
does
permit
our
state
to
single
out
property
of
the
corporation
and
subject
it
with
taxation
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others.
that
in
doing
so,
that
the
legislature
reflected
the
will
of
the
people
of
the
state
and
i
respectfully
ask
the
support
to
take
this
into
consideration,
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that’s
right
and
so
that
the
incentive
of
course,
on
the
legislature
is
that
we
would
have
no
way
of
replacing
this
tremendous
volume
of
revenue
for
our
school
district.
so
it’s
inconceivable
that
having
gone
through
the
anguish
of
placing
the
income
tax
on
the
state
that
the
legislature
would
do
nothing
to
finance
the
schools.
certainly,
the
whole
attempt
here
is
to
have
a
responsible
and
reasonable
approach
to
this
tremendous
problem
of
financing
local
government
and
specifically
the
schools
of
our
state.
mr.
william
j.
scott
it
would
violate
the
illinois
constitution.
mr.
william
j.
scott
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
scott
that’s
my
interpretation
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
well,
i
think
one
of
the
important
factors
of
this
case
is
that
all
of
the
states
like
illinois
are
going
through
this
transition.
48
out
of
50
states
do
have
some
type
of
a
personal
property
tax.
ours
of
course
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
we
had
a
very
real
problem.
remember
amending
our
constitution
took
us
a
100
years
to
get
it
done?
mr.
william
j.
scott
no,
i
don’t.
generally
speaking,
the
--
mr.
william
j.
scott
thank
you.
the
chief
of
our
appellate
division
died
of
a
heart
attack.
he
had
been
the
person
who
had
been
handling
this
case
and
that
without
the
benefit
of
his
consultation,
it
may
well
be
that
we
are
overlooking.
