mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
or
not
a
state’s
highest
court
can
disregard
a
constitution
of
that
state
and
its
own
prior
decisions
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
classification
for
tax
purpose
is
valid.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
well,
i
believe
that
the
determination
of
the
validity
of
a
classification
as
whether
or
not
it’s
offensive
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
be.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
i
believe
that
whether
a
state
court
determines
--
resolves
a
case
in
accordance
with
its
own
law
or
completely
disregards
its
own
law,
it
own
case
law
and
its
own
constitution
in
deciding
a
case,
is
a
federal
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
litigants
who
present
pleadings,
arguments,
all
the
way
through
in
the
case
and
may
i
call
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
appendix
and
i
think
it's,

there
is
only
one
relevant
docket
entry
which
antedates
the
approval
by
the
elector
in
illinois
of
the
1970
constitution.
and
throughout
the
litigation,
the
state's
attorney
of
cook
county,
and
the
attorney
general
as
well
have
relied
on
--
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
justice
schaefer,
no
your
honor.
justice
schaefer
relied
on
the
superseded
illinois
constitution
of
1870
to
invalidate
ix-a.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
well,
i
think
the
federal
question
is,
must
our
litigants
deprived
of
a
fair
trial
and
due
process
of
law
when
a
state
court
refuses
to
observe
its
own
case
law
and
its
own
constitution
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
decision.
you
see,
the
1970
constitution
came
into
effect
on
july
1,
1971.
the
opinion
handed
down
by
justice
schaefer
appeared
about
10
days
later.
now
the
case
law
in
illinois
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
opinions
written
by
justice
schaefer
say
that
the
illinois
reviewing
courts
must
decide
cases
in
terms
of
the
law
as
it
exists
at
the
time
of
the
decision
and
not
at
some
prior
time.
not
only
that,
justice
shafer
in
an
opinion,
written
shortly
before
this
in
a
case
called,
in
the
hammer
case,
which
appears
in
--
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
i
am
sorry.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
yes.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
well
we
are
raising
it
because
justice
schaefer
limited
his
examination
of
the
governing
law
to
illinois'
1870
constitution.
the
illinois'
1870
constitution
said
that
you
could
not
--
that
the
personal
property
tax
must
be
uniform
and
it
must
be
applied
to
everyone.
the
1970
constitution
provides
specifically
for
classification,
and
it
provides
that
the
classes
maybe
relieved
of
the
tax
in
series,
if
you
--
at
page
7
of
our
brief,
personal
property
tax
which
is
section
5
of
the
illinois
constitution
of
1970.
it
says
that
the
general
assembly
may
classify
personal
property
for
purposes
of
taxation
by
evaluation,
abolished
such
taxes
on
any
or
all
classes
and
authorized
the
levy
of
taxes
in
lieu
of
the
taxation
of
personal
property
by
valuation.
in
other
words,
under
the
1970
constitution,
you
can
make
any
kind
of
a
reasonable
classification
that
doesn’t
offend
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
will
be
all
right.
and
it
also
says
that
if
you
make
nine
classifications,
you
can
take
it
off
classification
one
this
year.
classification
two
the
next
year,
and
also
as
well
as
not
to
--
and
as
long
as
that
is
not
offensive
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
is
if
the
classes
are
drawn
properly,
that
will
be
valid.
now,
this
was
impossible
under
the
1870
constitution.
now,
i
think
that
it’s
clear
that
the
1970
constitution
of
illinois
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
decision.
the
cases
which
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
reviewing
court
must
use
the
1970
constitution
in
determining
this
case
are
also
in
the
brief
and
i
don't
think
that
they
require
any
elaboration.
so
it
is
simply
a
question
of
which
illinois
constitution
governs
and
by
using
the
wrong
one,
and
it
is
wrong
in
terms
of
the
precedent
of
that
court.
i
think
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois
had
been
denied
a
fair
trial,
particularly
since
all
pleadings,
all
briefs,
every
presentation
to
each
and
every
court,
both
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
those
before
it
were
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
the
1970
constitution
was
in
effect.
and
in
addition,
we
have
cases
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
anticipate
the
effective
date
of
a
constitutional
provision.
in
the
hammer
case,
and
if
this
is
again
an
opinion
from
mr.
justice
schaefer,
the
case
was
disposed
off
after
ix-a
had
been
adopted
by
the
people,
but
before
its
effective
date.
in
that
case,
the
rule
was
invoked
sua
sponte
by
the
court,
and
that
was
in
december
1970.
we
have
every
reason
to
expect
that
the
1971
constitution
would
be
the
controlling
law
in
deciding
this
case,
it
should
be.
we
anticipated
that,
we
relied
on
it.
and
gentleman,
the
rules
were
changed
after
the
game
was
played
and
this
is
what
we
objected.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
well,
the
1970
constitution
had
been
adopted
by
the
people.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
let
me
give
your
honor
the
chronology.
the
ix-a
was
approved
by
the
people
of
illinois
on
november
the
3rd,
1970.
it
was
to
go
into
effect
on
january
1st,
1971.
the
new
constitution
of
illinois
was
approved
by
the
electorate
december
15th
of
1970,
and
was
to
go
into
effect
july
1st,
1971.
now,
the
only
event
reflected
in
the
appendix
--
relevant
docket
entries
that
antedates,
the
day
when
the
1970
constitution
was
approved
by
the
people
of
illinois,
was
the
filing
of
the
first
complaint
in
the
lake
shore
case
and
every
subsequent
filing
came
in
after
december
the
15th
of
1970.
and
based
on
the
precedence
set
by
that
court,
the
court
should
have,
if
it
was
going
to
follow
its
own
rules
and
its
own
declarations,
decided
this
case
in
terms
of
the
1970
constitution.
the
1970
constitution
specifically
permits
classification
and
for
removal
of
the
personal
property
tax
from
some
classes
and
not
others.
it
compels
replacement
of
that
tax
in
1979,
and
the
imposition
of
a
tax
to
replace
the
revenues
lost.
and
this
is
another
very
important
point,
because
i
think
your
honors
must
appreciate
that
this
decision
emasculates
the
revenue
article
of
the
1970
constitution,
and
totally
perverts
the
intent
of
the
people
and
their
expectation.
to
paraphrase
what
was
to
happen,
and
there
has
been
some
dispute
about
what
--
the
definition
of
the
term
individuals.
the
attorney
general
has
emphasized
the
approach
that
says,
individuals
are
everyone
except
corporations.
the
state's
attorney
has
emphasized
an
approach
which
says,
individuals
are
--
it
means
only
the
non-business
property
of
natural
persons.
now,
our
approach
is
based
on
custom
and
usage
in
the
nomenclature
of
property
tax
administration
of
illinois.
for
example,
the
law
requires
everyone
in
illinois
to
file
a
schedule
with
his
assessor.
there
are
basically
three
classes
of
schedules.
one
of
them
is
titled
individuals,
the
other
is
businesses,
and
the
third
is
corporations.
every
lawyer
in
illinois
who
deals
in
tax
matters,
if
asked
what
individuals
means?
he
says,
“that
is
the
non-business
property
of
natural
persons,
because
that
is
all
what
is
left”
if
you
separate
unincorporated
businesses
and
corporations
from
the
entire
pie
of
those
subject
to
the
personal
property
tax.
alright,
now
that
is
the
kind
of
a
definition
argument
that
we
were
fighting
about
before
and
our
position
is
that
by
either
definition
it's
valid.
now,
what
was
intended
is
this.
the
individuals
were
to
be
excused
from
the
tax
on
january
1,
1970.
between
january
2
and
i
beg
your
pardon
1971,
january
2,
1971
to
january
1,
1979,
the
tax
was
to
remain
on
non-individuals.
now,
on
january
1,
1979
or
before,
that
tax
was
to
be
replaced
by
another
tax
or
the
revenue
was
to
be
replaced
by
another
tax,
i
beg
your
pardon
and
that
tax,
if
it
was
to
be
an
income
tax,
would
be
an
exception
to
the
eight
to
five
differential
provided
in
the
income
tax
provisions
of
the
illinois
1970
constitution.
what
happens
–
and
so
the
result
of
that
what
actually
be,
to
preserve
the
status
quo
with
respect
to
who
pays
the
personal
property
tax
in
illinois,
because
as
everyone
concedes
corporations
or
businesses
pay
about
over
90%
of
it.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
your
honor,
i
confess,
i
do
not
have
the
answer
to
that
question
but
i
would
anticipate
that
we
maybe
here
in
1971.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
i
beg
your
pardon,
1981
i
think
is
--
about
the
timing.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
yes.
i
do
not
know
really.
i
think
that
i
am
confident
that
if
the
legislature
refuses
to
act
every
effort
will
be
made
to
compel
them
to
do
so.
how
that
will
come
about
that,
i
do
not
know.
but,
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
this
that
if
you
invalidate
the
exoneration
of
individuals,
then
everyone
is
subject
to
that
tax
after
january
1,
1971.
therefore,
everyone
is
subject
to
the
replacement
tax.
if
the
replacement
tax
is
in
exception
to
the
eight
to
five
ratio,
then
it
would
be
uniform.
the
effect
of
this
is
to
shift
the
burden
of
the
personal
property
tax
from
businesses
and
corporations
back
to
the
wage
earner.
this
is
what
happens
under
justice
schaefer’s
decision.
this
is
what
we
object
to,
and
this
is
the
reason
we
feel
that
it
is
so
important,
that
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
be
reversed
and
we
think
we
are
on
right
grounds.
this
court
did
ignore
its
own
constitution,
it
did
ignore
its
own
prior
decisions,
it
did
enter
a
decision
which
in
effect
nullified
the
revenue
article
of
the
new
constitution,
and
we
urge
that
they
would
be
reversed.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
or
not
a
state’s
highest
court
can
disregard
a
constitution
of
that
state
and
its
own
prior
decisions
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
classification
for
tax
purpose
is
valid.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
well,
i
believe
that
the
determination
of
the
validity
of
a
classification
as
whether
or
not

mr.
aubrey

i

that
whether

you

on
july

1971.
the
opinion
handed
down
by

schaefer
appeared

days

now
the
case
law
in

as

say
that

be
the
controlling
law
in
deciding
this
case,
it
should
be.
we
anticipated
that,
we
relied
on
it.
and
gentleman,
the
rules
were
changed
after
the
game
was
played
and
this
is
what
we
objected.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
well,
the
1970
constitution
had
been
adopted
by
the
people.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
let
me
give
your
honor
the
chronology.
the
ix-a
was
approved
by
the
people
of
illinois
on
november
the
3rd,
1970.
it
was
to
go
into
effect
on
january
1st,
1971.
the
new
constitution
of
illinois
was
approved
by
the
electorate
december
15th
of
1970,
and
was
to
go
into
effect
july
1st,
1971.
now,
the
only
event
reflected
in
the
appendix
--
relevant
docket
entries
that
antedates,
the
day
when
the
1970
constitution
was
approved
by
the
people
of
illinois,
was
the
filing
of
the
first
complaint
in
the
lake
shore
case
and
every
subsequent
filing
came
in
after
december
the
15th
of
1970.
and
based
on
the
precedence
set
by
that
court,
the
court
should
have,
if
it
was
going
to
follow
its
own
rules
and
its
own
declarations,
decided
this
case
in
terms
of
the
1970
constitution.
the
1970
constitution
specifically
permits
classification
and
for
removal
of
the
personal
property
tax
from
some
classes
and
not
others.
it
compels
replacement
of
that
tax
in
1979,
and
the
imposition
of
a
tax
to
replace
the
revenues
lost.
and
this
is
another
very
important
point,
because
i
think
your
honors
must
appreciate
that
this
decision
emasculates
the
revenue
article
of
the
1970
constitution,
and
totally
perverts
the
intent
of
the
people
and
their
expectation.
to
paraphrase
what
was
to
happen,
and
there
has
been
some
dispute
about
what
--
the
definition
of
the
term
individuals.
the
attorney
general
has
emphasized
the
approach
that
says,
individuals
are
everyone
except
corporations.
the
state's
attorney
has
emphasized
an
approach
which
says,
individuals
are
--
it
means
only
the
non-business
property
of
natural
persons.
now,
our
approach
is
based
on
custom
and
usage
in
the
nomenclature
of
property
tax
administration
of
illinois.
for
example,
the
law
requires
everyone
in
illinois
to
file
a
schedule
with
his
assessor.
there
are
basically
three
classes
of
schedules.
one
of
them
is
titled
individuals,
the
other
is
businesses,
and
the
third
is
corporations.
every
lawyer
in
illinois
who
deals
in
tax
matters,
if
asked
what
individuals
means?
he
says,
“that
is
the
non-business
property
of
natural
persons,
because
that
is
all
what
is
left”
if
you
separate
unincorporated
businesses
and
corporations
from
the
entire
pie
of
those
subject
to
the
personal
property
tax.
alright,
now
that
is
the
kind
of
a
definition
argument
that
we
were
fighting
about
before
and
our
position
is
that
by
either
definition
it's
valid.
now,
what
was
intended
is
this.
the
individuals
were
to
be
excused
from
the
tax
on
january
1,
1970.
between
january
2
and
i
beg
your
pardon
1971,
january
2,
1971
to
january
1,
1979,
the
tax
was
to
remain
on
non-individuals.
now,
on
january
1,
1979
or
before,
that
tax
was
to
be
replaced
by
another
tax
or
the
revenue
was
to
be
replaced
by
another
tax,
i
beg
your
pardon
and
that
tax,
if
it
was
to
be
an
income
tax,
would
be
an
exception
to
the
eight
to
five
differential
provided
in
the
income
tax
provisions
of
the
illinois
1970
constitution.
what
happens
–
and
so
the
result
of
that
what
actually
be,
to
preserve
the
status
quo
with
respect
to
who
pays
the
personal
property
tax
in
illinois,
because
as
everyone
concedes
corporations
or
businesses
pay
about
over
90%
of
it.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
your
honor,
i
confess,
i
do
not
have
the
answer
to
that
question
but
i
would
anticipate
that
we
maybe
here
in
1971.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
i
beg
your
pardon,
1981
i
think
is
--
about
the
timing.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
yes.
i
do
not
know
really.
i
think
that
i
am
confident
that
if
the
legislature
refuses
to
act
every
effort
will
be
made
to
compel
them
to
do
so.
how
that
will
come
about
that,
i
do
not
know.
but,
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
this
that
if
you
invalidate
the
exoneration
of
individuals,
then
everyone
is
subject
to
that
tax
after
january
1,
1971.
therefore,
everyone
is
subject
to
the
replacement
tax.
if
the
replacement
tax
is
in
exception
to
the
eight
to
five
ratio,
then
it
would
be
uniform.
the
effect
of
this
is
to
shift
the
burden
of
the
personal
property
tax
from
businesses
and
corporations
back
to
the
wage
earner.
this
is
what
happens
under
justice
schaefer’s
decision.
this
is
what
we
object
to,
and
this
is
the
reason
we
feel
that
it
is
so
important,
that
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
be
reversed
and
we
think
we
are
on
right
grounds.
this
court
did
ignore
its
own
constitution,
it
did
ignore
its
own
prior
decisions,
it
did
enter
a
decision
which
in
effect
nullified
the
revenue
article
of
the
new
constitution,
and
we
urge
that
they
would
be
reversed.
mr.
aubrey
f.
kaplan
thank
you
your
honor.
