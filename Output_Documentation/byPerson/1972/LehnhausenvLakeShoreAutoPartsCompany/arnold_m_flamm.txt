mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
risk
of
running
out
of
time,
in
my
prepared
argument,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
myself
to
few
of
the
questions
that
have
come
from
the
bench.
i
am
well
aware
that
it
is
not
the
function
or
the
obligation
of
this
court
to
construe
section
5-c
of
the
new
illinois
constitution
with
regard
to
the
supposed
ultimate
abolition
of
personal
property
taxation
in
illinois.
i
must
strongly
disagree
with
the
attorney
general’s
opinion.
i
think
that
it
is
not
self-executing
and
furthermore
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
and
refer
to
a
very
important
article
on
the
subject,
it
could
not
be
executed
by
the
legislature
even
if
it
wanted
to.
so
that
i
think
personal
property
taxation
in
illinois
on
whatever
category
is
permissible,
is
going
to
be
with
us
until
the
constitution
is
again
amended.
some
reference
was
made
to
the
relative
or
supposed
relative
difficulty
of
collecting
the
tax
from
individuals
as
compared
from
collecting
it
from
corporations.
apparently,
90
some
percent
is
collected
from
corporations,
but
that
i
can
assure
the
court
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
administrative
ease.
it
has
to
do
with
one
fact
only
and
that
fact
is,
that
individuals
vote
at
elections
and
may
vote
for
or
against
tax
collectors,
whereas
corporations
do
not
have
the
privilege
of
voting.
it
is
--
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
it
is
quite
true
your
honor,
that
as
a
general
rule
i
have
mentioned
this
in
our
brief
that
corporate
property
tends
to
be
more
visible
and
is
therefore
more
easily
assessed.
but
certainly,
automobiles
for
example
of
individuals,
there
is
not
the
slightest
problem
with
assessing
that,
and
yet
as
pointed
out
by
the
legislature
and
its
argument,
the
city
of
chicago,
in
the
city
of
chicago,
no
attempt
at
all
has
made
to
assess
automobiles
at
any
figure.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
not
--
to
some
extent,
there
is
a
visibility
factor
which
differentially
discriminates
against
corporations.
but
essentially,
the
problem
is
not
an
administrative
problem,
it
is
a
problem
of
the
will
to
collect
taxes
and
as
terms
of
the
arbitrariness
of
the
whole
taxing
system,
it
is
far
more
arbitrary
with
respect
to
corporations
than
it
is
with
respect
to
individuals.
individuals,
no
matter
where
they
live
--
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
it
is
certainly
downstate
where
there
are
farm
property
which
is
relatively
visible.
they
do
get
a
significant
proportion
of
their
revenue
from
farmers.
the
biggest
proportion
throughout
the
state
comes
from
public
utilities
which
of
course
as
chief
justice
mentioned
obviously
file
personal
property
schedules
and
they
cannot
hide
their
property.
but,
in
terms
--
and
quite
apart
from
who
pays
most,
in
terms
of
the
intra-class
differentials
which
is
the
most
arbitrary
assessment
among
corporations,
it
is
far
greater
than
among
individuals,
because
individuals,
no
matter
where
they
live
pay
a
relatively
small
tax
which
bears
no
relation
to
any
property
they
own,
but
there
is
a
politically
adjusted
or
determined
matter,
maybe
it
is
a
percentage
of
their
real
estate
tax
bill
or
a
percentage
of
their,
depending
on
kind
of
the
car
they
have,
but
at
least
there
is
a
small
amount.
i
do
not
need
to
make
too
much
of
an
issue
over
this.
i
do
not
think
it
is
directly
relevant.
as
to
justice
blackmun's
inquiry,
i
am
confident,
i
know
for
a
fact
that
there
is
no
other
state
which
has
anything
comparable
or
even
purports
to
discriminate
against
corporations
for
purposes
of
property
taxation.
in
terms
of
alternative
revenue
sources
the
argument
has
been
made
that
article
ix
(a)
was
a
means
of
relieving
the
wage
earner
or
creating
a
more
equitable
tax
system.
well,
perhaps
so,
but
certainly
there
are
alternatives,
in
fact
since
the
decision
of
this
case
by
the
state
court,
the
legislature
has
adopted
an
alternative,
a
flat
$5,000
exemption
from
personal
property
taxes
for
corporations
and
individuals
which
no
doubt
will
have
substantially
the
same
effect
as
this
proposed
amendment
without
creating
any
federal
constitutional
problem.
it
may
create
some
serious
state
problems,
but
no
federal
problem
i
think.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well
the
fact
is
the
first
x
number
of
dollars,
i
don't
see
any
particular
problem
where
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
to
that
exemption.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
i
think
that
another
example
might
be
that
many
states
that
have
for
exemptions
for
persons
over
65
years
of
age
and
there
is
a
–
i
certainly
would
concede
that
there
is
some
parallel
there,
but
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
exemption
for
homeowners
or
for
aged
homeowners
can
be
justified
on
the
basis,
in
the
case
of
aged
ones
that
they
have
no
longer
a
source
of
income,
but
it's
not
simply
based
on
ownership
in
such
but
it's
based
on
the
fact
that
older
people
presumably
no
longer
have
a
regular
source
of
income
yet
their
tax
bills
keep
going
up
year
after
year.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
if
there
was
a
discrimination,
of
course
you
say
discrimination
against
corporate
ownership
of
apartment
buildings
but
they
would
be
as
i
understand
it
in
the
same
category
as
an
individual
owner
of
an
apartment
building,
the
discrimination
certainly
is
against
apartment
buildings
as
compared
to
single
family
homes
but
that
there
is
no
--
we
see
no
constitutional
problem
with
that.
that
was
based
on
a
kind
of
property
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
ownership.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well
i
think
that
is
a
valid
--
that
was
base
on
a
nature
or
use
of
the
property
and
even
in
the
back
in
the
california
railroad
tax
case
90
years
ago,
justice
field
specifically
recognized
that
a
classification
based
on
the
nature
or
use
of
the
property
is
a
valid
one.
it
is
only
the
classification
based
on
the
nature
of
the
ownerships,
at
least
particularly
a
corporate
ownership
as
against
non-corporate
ownership
that
was
offending
a
violation
in
his
view.
well,
if
i
may
return
my
prepared
(voice
overlap)
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
i
must
stay
that
i
appreciate
the
court's
time,
i
am
not
a
colleague
of
the
weil
&
company
because
we
are
opposed
on
a
very
important
issue
over
here
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
thank
you.[laughter]
in
the
some
ways
i
suppose
this
is
a
very
old
fashioned
sort
of
a
law
suit.
at
a
central
issue
the
facts
are
essentially
identical
to
those
which
were
before
this
court
90
years
ago
in
the
santa
clara
county
versus
the
southern
pacific.
in
santa
clara
case,
court
served
to
establish
the
fundamental
principle
that
corporations
are
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
in
a
very
real
sense,
i
suggest
it
is
that
doctrine
which
is
under
challenge
today
as
a
consequence
of
the
ill
conceived
constitutional
amendment
proposed
by
the
illinois
legislature.
i
represent
the
lake
shore
auto
parts
company
as
you
know,
a
personal
property
taxpayer
in
cook
county.
we
initiated
this
litigation
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
and
lake
shore
did
so,
i
will
freely
admit
not
because
of
any
desire
to
vindicate
the
abstract
rights
of
corporations
and
even
less
from
any
desire
to
pay
homage
to
the
memory
of
justice
fields
who
promulgated
the
commission
of
doctrine
here.
our
intention
obviously
was
to
free
ourselves
from
the
yolk
of
a
burdensome
tax,
a
tax
which
is
not
merely
burdensome
but
which
is
at
least
in
illinois
arbitrary,
scandalous
in
a
source
of
disrespect
for
the
courts
and
for
the
judicial
process.
i
need
not
labor
that
point
because
the
attorney
general
himself
agrees
fully
with
us
in
this
court
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
beyond
then
it's
removed
i
think
by
the
official
explanation
of
the
amendment
prepared
by
the
illinois
general
assembly.
that
document
which
is
appended
as
exhibit
8
in
our
brief
as
a
complete,
all
inclusive
statement
of
the
intention
of
a
legislature,
needs
no
room
for
summarize
as
to
what
might
have
been
intended.
and
the
interesting
i
think
about
that
official
explanation
is
that
every
evil
of
the
personal
property
tax
set
forth
therein
is
fully
as
applicable
to
corporations
as
it
is
to
individuals.
one
may
reread
that
i
think
time
after
time
and
find
no
clue
in
there
as
to
why
the
general
assembly
eliminated
the
tax
only
on
individuals.
the
principle
set
forth
in
the
santa
clara
case
originally
announced
there
and
adopted
more
firmly
in
the
a
quaker
city
cab
case
in
1925,
has
gone
unchallenged
in
this
court
for
almost
40
years.
it
has
been
accepted
as
a
matter
of
doctrine
that
states
may
not
discriminate
for
property
tax
purposes
as
against
corporate
ownership
as
such.
on
one
occasion
admittedly
in
1920,
this
court
departed
from
that
rule
in
the
fort
smith
lumber
company
case.
that's
a
very
brief
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes
who
upheld
a
discriminatory
statute
on
the
ground
that
the
arkansas
legislature
might
conceivably
have
been
acting
in
furtherance
of
a
permissible
state
policy
namely
a
policy
of
discouraging
ownership
of
corporate
stock
by
corporations.
it
is
generally
been
accepted
i
think
that,
that
case
has
been
overruled
effectively
by
quaker
city
cab.
at
any
rate
fort
smith
has
been
hardly
ever
cited
by
anyone
in
the
60
years,
40
years,
50
years
since
it
was
decided
and
passed
in
the
limbo.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
allied
stores
case,
this
court
refrained
i
think
rather
significantly
from
even
citing
the
fort
smith
lumber
case.
now
the
allied
stores
case
is
a
difficult
case.
i
will
concede
we
have
discussed
it
at
great
length
in
our
brief,
i
just
don't
think
there
is
time
to
try
to
get
into
it
in
the
oral
argument.
we
recognize
the
problem.
we
think
the
attorney
general
has
interpreted
that
case
in
a
manner
far
more
broadly
than
the
language
of
the
case
warrants.
the
real
issue
i
think
here
is
not
what
the
law
has
but
what
the
law
should
be.
shall
the
accepted
rule
be
changed
so
as
to
permit
state
legislatures
free
reign
in
indulging
their
natural
propensities
to
tax
only
those
property
owners
who
let
the
power
devote
while
exonerating
from
tax
those
who
do
not
possess
that
vote
--
who
do
possess
that
vote,
weapon
and
who
are
in
all
other
respects
identically
situated?
now
the
state
here
argues
and
most
specifically
in
its
reply
brief
that
this
discriminatory
tax
is
not
really
a
property
tax
at
all.
it's
really
a
franchise
tax
which
masquerades
as
a
property
tax.
they
say
that
the
legislature
imposed
it
on
our
corporations
as
the
price
for
directing
corporations
that
privilege
of
doing
business
in
illinois.
that's
another
interesting
argument
that
was
originally
raised
in
the
santa
clara
case
90
years
ago.
it
was
rejected
there
by
justice
field
on
the
ground
that
whatever
might
have
been
that
simply
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
tax.
and
the
legislature
in
california
there
and
illinois
here
did
not
impose
the
tax
as
a
franchise
tax,
did
not
intend
it
as
a
franchise
tax
and
there
is
not
a
worried
in
the
official
argument
or
explanation
to
suggest
that
it
is
a
franchise
tax.
when
as
and
if
a
state
legislature
adopts
a
franchise
tax
in
a
form
of
a
property
tax,
and
no
one
ever
has
yet
to
my
knowledge,
there
will
be
time
enough
for
this
court
to
consider
whether
that
is
a
valid
form
of
a
taxation.
certainly
traditionally
courts
in
general
and
this
court
in
particular
have
generally
treated
the
two
forms
of
tax
that
is
a
property
tax
on
one
hand
and
an
excise
tax
including
a
franchise
tax
as
being
mutually
exclusive.
maybe
they
are
wrong.
i
realize
there
is
nothing
god
given
about
that
distinction
and
when
moses
came
down
from
mt.
sinai
and
looked
at
his
tablet
there
was
nothing
said
there
about
preserving
the
distinction
between
property
taxes
and
non-property
taxes,
but
i
think
the
distinction
is
so
well
embedded
in
our
law,
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
the
constitution
of
all
states
in
this
union
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
state
court
decisions,
in
economic
theory,
in
legal
theory
that
to
now
i
say
it's
all
a
mistake,
there
really
is
no
inherent
difference.
i
think
that
would
be
to
show
nothing
else
disrespect
to
a
great
deal
of
thought
that
has
gone
into
the
subject
over
the
past
200
years
and
might
just
full
force
differences
from
illinois
supreme
court
decision
in
reif
versus
barrett
decided
in
1934
at
355,
illinois
where
the
court
says
it
was
quite
typical,
i
think
of
judicial
thinking
in
general,
“a
property
tax
is
levied
merely
for
the
purpose
of
raising
revenue
and
is
levied
against
a
property.
it
does
not
seek
or
in
anywise
attempt
to
control
the
use,
operation
or
regulation
of
the
property.
when
the
tax
is
raised,
the
mission
of
a
property
tax
has
been
fulfilled.
the
property
tax
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
question
of
privilege,
license
or
permission.”
i
turn
in
the
time
remaining
to
the
second
issue
which
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
that
is
the
propriety
of
the
remedy
decreed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
court
understands,
i
trust
that
we
agree
with
the
illinois
supreme
court's
holding
on
the
invalidity
of
the
discrimination.
we
strongly
disagree
with
its
holding
on
the
remedy.
now
the
trial
court
in
lake
shore
has
sustained
our
position
that
the
appropriate
remedy
was
to
invalidate
the
tax
on
all
tax
payers,
the
personal
property
tax
on
all
taxpayers.
in
reaching
that
conclusion
the
trial
judge
considered
if
the
question
of
the
appropriate
remedy
was
essentially
one
of
ascertaining,
the
presumed
intention
of
the
people
at
illinois,
that
is
whether
they
would
have
approved
this
amendment
if
they
had
known
that
its
effect
was
going
to
be
to
abolish
personal
property
taxes
in
total.
and
in
an
oral
opinion
rendered
from
the
bench
of
the
trial
court
said,
“there
was
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
anyone
that
it
would
have
passed
overwhelmingly
even
without
the
words
as
to
individuals.”
it's
quoted
at
page
54
of
our
brief
and
page
46
in
the
record.
now
the
illinois
supreme
court
reversed
down
this
issue
and
in
doing
so
that
court
made
no
pretense
of
ascertaining
anyone’s
intention.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
under
traditional
holdings
on
this
subject
i
think
it
is.
i
recognize
that
how
one
goes
about
ascertaining
the
intention
of
the
people
on
the
subject
that
they
never
voted
on.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
think
theoretically
that's
--
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
your
honor
in
--
that's
of
course
a
touchy
question
because
i
am
aware
that
we
face
that
problem
over
here
and
i
cannot
say
with
any
great
confidence
that
it's
not
that
we
have
developed
the
argument
in
our
brief
at
considerable
length.
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
old
case
of
gwen
versus
united
states,
this
court
said
there
that
if
the
state
court
has
not
pronounced
state
law
on
the
subject
to
the
remedy
then
this
court
is
free
to
do
so.
now
in
subsequent
decisions
this
court
certainly
has
honored
the
standpoint
decision
where
the
state
court
has
made
a
finding
on
the
question
of
intention.
but
the
problem
with
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
decision
here,
they
made
no
pretense
of
finding
anything.
they
simply,
after
holding
the
discrimination
of
the
invalid
they
said
therefore
the
amendment
must
fall
and
there
is
not
a
reason
given,
one
could
read
that
opinion
i
suggest
time
after
time
and
not
know
why
they
reached
that
result
rather
than
the
result
reached
by
the
trial
court.
now
if
this
court
is
satisfied
that,
that
is
a
determination,
a
ruling,
a
finding
by
the
state
supreme
court
then
i
have
to
confess
i
am
beaten
because
the
court,
if
that
is
the
case
it
is
a
state
ruling.
we
have
argued
that
it
is
not
a
state
ruling.
we
further
argue
that
at
least
in
this
case
to
permit
this
sort
of
a
result
would
have
a
severely
chilling
effect
on
the
association
of
equal
protection
rights
at
least
in
the
field
of
taxation
because
if
a
taxpayer
knows
that
he
can't
win,
even
if
he
wins,
he
is
still
going
to
end
up
subject
to
the
tax.
there
are
very
many
people
going
to
challenge
taxing
statutes.
i
am
aware,
this
is
the
first
time
this
argument
has
been
advanced
in
a
property
case
context
as
distinguished
from
a
free
speech
or
voting
rights
case.
i
am
also
aware
that
this
court
quite
properly
has
accorded
priority
and
precedence
to
personal
rights
as
compared
to
property
rights.
but
i
think
--
at
least
i
hope
that
property
rights
are
still
a
matter
entitled
to
protection
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
i
think
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
can
do
this
to
us.
we
can
forget
about
any
challenges
to
any
taxing
statutes
in
illinois
at
least
and
i
might
say
that
there
are
now
on
the
books
of
illinois
to
my
knowledge
two
or
three
taxing
statutes
enacted
in
the
last
year
or
two
which
quite
obviously
are
unconstitutional
under
the
state
constitution.
nobody
has
brought
a
challenge
to
them
and
i
dare
say
nobody
is
going
to
because
they
foresee
the
kind
of
result
that
they
are
going
to
get.
we
have
argued
this
point
that
in
our
brief
at
some
length
i
kept
denying
the
problem
in
fact
we
have
at
one
point
thought
to
withdraw
from
this
case
after
the
court
denied
our
--
after
court
dismissed
our
appeal,
we
sought
to
appeal
as
the
court
recalls
directly
from
the
judgment
below
on
the
ground
that
the
remedy
violated
our
constitutional
rights.
the
court
dismissed
that
appeal
for
one
of
jurisdiction
and
at
that
point
feeling
rather
discouraged
we
asked
leave
to
get
out
entirely.
he
wouldn't
let
us
out
so
we
are
back
in
and
we
are
still
in
and
we
rethought
the
matter
and
i
hope
that
we
are
still
in
the
ball
game
on
this
issue.
i
say
we
are
opposed
on
the
question
of
the
remedy
most
vociferously
by
the
four
school
districts
which
are,
appear
in
this
court
as
amicus.
more
disturbingly
we
are
opposed
on
this
issue
by
m.
weil
&
sons,
one
of
the
respondents
in
the
shapiro
case
and
that's
disturbing
because
m.
weil
&
sons
purports
to
represent
a
class
of
all
corporations
including
lake
shore,
the
finding
of
that
effect
as
we
have
argued
is
clearly
void,
having
been
entered
without
semblance
of
due
process
of
law
but
nevertheless
having
reported
to
represent
all
corporations,
they
now
fix
the
position
that
the
court
below
is
correct,
ask
this
court
to
affirm
even
though
the
result
would
be
to
grant
no
benefit
at
all
to
any
corporations
including
lake
shore
and
including
m.
weil
&
sons
but
mr.
biro
will
address
the
court
on
that
subject
and
perhaps
he
can
explain
his
position.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
oh
no,
the
income
tax
has
been
effect
since
prior
to
the
adoption
of
any
of
this
amendment.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
it's
supposed
to
be
a
flat
rate
tax.
it's
a
flat
rate
tax
with
a
differential
rate
on
corporations
and
individuals
with
rather
substantial
exemptions
to
it.
yes.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
at
presently
not
effective
you
honor,
and
it's
just
two
minutes
i
have
remaining,
i
would
address
myself
to
one
argument
that
has
been
made
here
and
has
been
made
the
school
districts
is
that
somehow
chaos
would
result
if
the
decision
below
were
affirmed
that
the
school
districts
would
lose
$300
million.
now
i
am
well
very
much
concerned
with
school
districts'
financing,
my
wife
happens
to
be
on
a
school
board
as
a
matter
of
fact.
so
i
get
both
sides
of
the
picture.
there
is
no
shortage
of
means
in
illinois
to
raise
alternative
sources
of
revenue.
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
risk
of
running
out
of
time,
in
my
prepared
argument,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
myself
to
few
of
the
questions
that
have
come
from
the
bench.
i
am
well
aware
that
it
is
not
the
function
or
the
obligation
of
this
court
to
construe
section
5-c
of
the
new
illinois
constitution
with
regard
to
the
supposed
ultimate
abolition
of
personal
property
taxation
in
illinois.
i
must
strongly
disagree
with
the
attorney
general’s
opinion.
i
think
that
it
is
not
self-executing
and
furthermore
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
and
refer
to
a
very
important
article
on
the
subject,
it
could
not
be
executed
by
the
legislature
even
if
it
wanted
to.
so
that
i
think
personal
property
taxation
in
illinois
on
whatever
category
is
permissible,
is
going
to
be
with
us
until
the
constitution
is
again
amended.
some
reference
was
made
to
the
relative
or
supposed
relative
difficulty
of
collecting
the
tax
from
individuals
as
compared
from
collecting
it
from
corporations.
apparently,
90
some
percent
is
collected
from
corporations,
but
that
i
can
assure
the
court
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
administrative
ease.
it
has
to
do
with
one
fact
only
and
that
fact
is,
that
individuals
vote
at
elections
and
may
vote
for
or
against
tax
collectors,
whereas
corporations
do
not
have
the
privilege
of
voting.
it
is
--
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
it
is
quite
true
your
honor,
that
as
a
general
rule
i
have
mentioned
this
in
our
brief
that
corporate
property
tends
to
be
more
visible
and
is
therefore
more
easily
assessed.
but
certainly,
automobiles
for
example
of
individuals,
there
is
not
the
slightest
problem
with
assessing
that,
and
yet
as
pointed
out
by
the
legislature
and
its
argument,
the
city
of
chicago,
in
the
city
of
chicago,
no
attempt
at
all
has
made
to
assess
automobiles
at
any
figure.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
not
--
to
some
extent,
there
is
a
visibility
factor
which
differentially
discriminates
against
corporations.
but
essentially,
the
problem
is
not
an
administrative
problem,
it
is
a
problem
of
the
will
to
collect
taxes
and
as
terms
of
the
arbitrariness
of
the
whole
taxing
system,
it
is
far
more
arbitrary
with
respect
to
corporations
than
it
is
with
respect
to
individuals.
individuals,
no
matter
where
they
live
--
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
it
is
certainly
downstate
where
there
are
farm
property
which
is
relatively
visible.
they
do
get
a
significant
proportion
of
their
revenue
from
farmers.
the
biggest
proportion
throughout
the
state
comes
from
public
utilities
which
of
course
as
chief
justice
mentioned
obviously
file
personal
property
schedules
and
they
cannot
hide
their
property.
but,
in
terms
--
and
quite
apart
from
who
pays
most,
in
terms
of
the
intra-class
differentials
which
is
the
most
arbitrary
assessment
among
corporations,
it
is
far
greater
than
among
individuals,
because
individuals,
no
matter
where
they
live
pay
a
relatively
small
tax
which
bears
no
relation
to
any
property
they
own,
but
there
is
a
politically
adjusted
or
determined
matter,
maybe
it
is
a
percentage
of
their
real
estate
tax
bill
or
a
percentage
of
their,
depending
on
kind
of
the
car
they
have,
but
at
least
there
is
a
small
amount.
i
do
not
need
to
make
too
much
of
an
issue
over
this.
i
do
not
think
it
is
directly
relevant.
as
to
justice
blackmun's
inquiry,
i
am
confident,
i
know
for
a
fact
that
there
is
no
other
state
which
has
anything
comparable
or
even
purports
to
discriminate
against
corporations
for
purposes
of
property
taxation.
in
terms
of
alternative
revenue
sources
the
argument
has
been
made
that
article
ix
(a)
was
a
means
of
relieving
the
wage
earner
or
creating
a
more
equitable
tax
system.
well,
perhaps
so,
but
certainly
there
are
alternatives,
in
fact
since
the
decision
of
this
case
by
the
state
court,
the
legislature
has
adopted
an
alternative,
a
flat
$5,000
exemption
from
personal
property
taxes
for
corporations
and
individuals
which
no
doubt
will
have
substantially
the
same
effect
as
this
proposed
amendment
without
creating
any
federal
constitutional
problem.
it
may
create
some
serious
state
problems,
but
no
federal
problem
i
think.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well
the
fact
is
the
first
x
number
of
dollars,
i
don't
see
any
particular
problem
where
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
to
that
exemption.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
i
think
that
another
example
might
be
that
many
states
that
have
for
exemptions
for
persons
over
65
years
of
age
and
there
is
a
–
i
certainly
would
concede
that
there
is
some
parallel
there,
but
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
exemption
for
homeowners
or
for
aged
homeowners
can
be
justified
on
the
basis,
in
the
case
of
aged
ones
that
they
have
no
longer
a
source
of
income,
but
it's
not
simply
based
on
ownership
in
such
but
it's
based
on
the
fact
that
older
people
presumably
no
longer
have
a
regular
source
of
income
yet
their
tax
bills
keep
going
up
year
after
year.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
if
there
was
a
discrimination,
of
course
you
say
discrimination
against
corporate
ownership
of
apartment
buildings
but
they
would
be
as
i
understand
it
in
the
same
category
as
an
individual
owner
of
an
apartment
building,
the
discrimination
certainly
is
against
apartment
buildings
as
compared
to
single
family
homes
but
that
there
is
no
--
we
see
no
constitutional
problem
with
that.
that
was
based
on
a
kind
of
property
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
ownership.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well
i
think
that
is
a
valid
--
that
was
base
on
a
nature
or
use
of
the
property
and
even
in
the
back
in
the
california
railroad
tax
case
90
years
ago,
justice
field
specifically
recognized
that
a
classification
based
on
the
nature
or
use
of
the
property
is
a
valid
one.
it
is
only
the
classification
based
on
the
nature
of
the
ownerships,
at
least
particularly
a
corporate
ownership
as
against
non-corporate
ownership
that
was
offending
a
violation
in
his
view.
well,
if
i
may
return
my
prepared
(voice
overlap)
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
i
must
stay
that
i
appreciate
the
court's
time,
i
am
not
a
colleague
of
the
weil
&
company
because
we
are
opposed
on
a
very
important
issue
over
here
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
thank
you.[laughter]
in
the
some
ways
i
suppose
this
is
a
very
old
fashioned
sort
of
a
law
suit.
at
a
central
issue
the
facts
are
essentially
identical
to
those
which
were
before
this
court
90
years
ago
in
the
santa
clara
county
versus
the
southern
pacific.
in
santa
clara
case,
court
served
to
establish
the
fundamental
principle
that
corporations
are
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
in
a
very
real
sense,
i
suggest
it
is
that
doctrine
which
is
under
challenge
today
as
a
consequence
of
the
ill
conceived
constitutional
amendment
proposed
by
the
illinois
legislature.
i
represent
the
lake
shore
auto
parts
company
as
you
know,
a
personal
property
taxpayer
in
cook
county.
we
initiated
this
litigation
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
and
lake
shore
did
so,
i
will
freely
admit
not
because
of
any
desire
to
vindicate
the
abstract
rights
of
corporations
and
even
less
from
any
desire
to
pay
homage
to
the
memory
of
justice
fields
who
promulgated
the
commission
of
doctrine
here.
our
intention
obviously
was
to
free
ourselves
from
the
yolk
of
a
burdensome
tax,
a
tax
which
is
not
merely
burdensome
but
which
is
at
least
in
illinois
arbitrary,
scandalous
in
a
source
of
disrespect
for
the
courts
and
for
the
judicial
process.
i
need
not
labor
that
point
because
the
attorney
general
himself
agrees
fully
with
us
in
this
court
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
beyond
then
it's
removed
i
think
by
the
official
explanation
of
the
amendment
prepared
by
the
illinois
general
assembly.
that
document
which
is
appended
as
exhibit
8
in
our
brief
as
a
complete,
all
inclusive
statement
of
the
intention
of
a
legislature,
needs
no
room
for
summarize
as
to
what
might
have
been
intended.
and
the
interesting
i
think
about
that
official
explanation
is
that
every
evil
of
the
personal
property
tax
set
forth
therein
is
fully
as
applicable
to
corporations
as
it
is
to
individuals.
one
may
reread
that
i
think
time
after
time
and
find
no
clue
in
there
as
to
why
the
general
assembly
eliminated
the
tax
only
on
individuals.
the
principle
set
forth
in
the
santa
clara
case
originally
announced
there
and
adopted
more
firmly
in
the
a
quaker
city
cab
case
in
1925,
has
gone
unchallenged
in
this
court
for
almost
40
years.
it
has
been
accepted
as
a
matter
of
doctrine
that
states
may
not
discriminate
for
property
tax
purposes
as
against
corporate
ownership
as
such.
on
one
occasion
admittedly
in
1920,
this
court
departed
from
that
rule
in
the
fort
smith
lumber
company
case.
that's
a
very
brief
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes
who
upheld
a
discriminatory
statute
on
the
ground
that
the
arkansas
legislature
might
conceivably
have
been
acting
in
furtherance
of
a
permissible
state
policy
namely
a
policy
of
discouraging
ownership
of
corporate
stock
by
corporations.
it
is
generally
been
accepted
i
think
that,
that
case
has
been
overruled
effectively
by
quaker
city
cab.
at
any
rate
fort
smith
has
been
hardly
ever
cited
by
anyone
in
the
60
years,
40
years,
50
years
since
it
was
decided
and
passed
in
the
limbo.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
allied
stores
case,
this
court
refrained
i
think
rather
significantly
from
even
citing
the
fort
smith
lumber
case.
now
the
allied
stores
case
is
a
difficult
case.
i
will
concede
we
have
discussed
it
at
great
length
in
our
brief,
i
just
don't
think
there
is
time
to
try
to
get
into
it
in
the
oral
argument.
we
recognize
the
problem.
we
think
the
attorney
general
has
interpreted
that
case
in
a
manner
far
more
broadly
than
the
language
of
the
case
warrants.
the
real
issue
i
think
here
is
not
what
the
law
has
but
what
the
law
should
be.
shall
the
accepted
rule
be
changed
so
as
to
permit
state
legislatures
free
reign
in
indulging
their
natural
propensities
to
tax
only
those
property
owners
who
let
the
power
devote
while
exonerating
from
tax
those
who
do
not
possess
that
vote
--
who
do
possess
that
vote,
weapon
and
who
are
in
all
other
respects
identically
situated?
now
the
state
here
argues
and
most
specifically
in
its
reply
brief
that
this
discriminatory
tax
is
not
really
a
property
tax
at
all.
it's
really
a
franchise
tax
which
masquerades
as
a
property
tax.
they
say
that
the
legislature
imposed
it
on
our
corporations
as
the
price
for
directing
corporations
that
privilege
of
doing
business
in
illinois.
that's
another
interesting
argument
that
was
originally
raised
in
the
santa
clara
case
90
years
ago.
it
was
rejected
there
by
justice
field
on
the
ground
that
whatever
might
have
been
that
simply
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
tax.
and
the
legislature
in
california
there
and
illinois
here
did
not
impose
the
tax
as
a
franchise
tax,
did
not
intend
it
as
a
franchise
tax
and
there
is
not
a
worried
in
the
official
argument
or
explanation
to
suggest
that
it
is
a
franchise
tax.
when
as
and
if
a
state
legislature
adopts
a
franchise
tax
in
a
form
of
a
property
tax,
and
no
one
ever
has
yet
to
my
knowledge,
there
will
be
time
enough
for
this
court
to
consider
whether
that
is
a
valid
form
of
a
taxation.
certainly
traditionally
courts
in
general
and
this
court
in
particular
have
generally
treated
the
two
forms
of
tax
that
is
a
property
tax
on
one
hand
and
an
excise
tax
including
a
franchise
tax
as
being
mutually
exclusive.
maybe
they
are
wrong.
i
realize
there
is
nothing
god
given
about
that
distinction
and
when
moses
came
down
from
mt.
sinai
and
looked
at
his
tablet
there
was
nothing
said
there
about
preserving
the
distinction
between
property
taxes
and
non-property
taxes,
but
i
think
the
distinction
is
so
well
embedded
in
our
law,
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
the
constitution
of
all
states
in
this
union
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
state
court
decisions,
in
economic
theory,
in
legal
theory
that
to
now
i
say
it's
all
a
mistake,
there
really
is
no
inherent
difference.
i
think
that
would
be
to
show
nothing
else
disrespect
to
a
great
deal
of
thought
that
has
gone
into
the
subject
over
the
past
200
years
and
might
just
full
force
differences
from
illinois
supreme
court
decision
in
reif
versus
barrett
decided
in
1934
at
355,
illinois
where
the
court
says
it
was
quite
typical,
i
think
of
judicial
thinking
in
general,
“a
property
tax
is
levied
merely
for
the
purpose
of
raising
revenue
and
is
levied
against
a
property.
it
does
not
seek
or
in
anywise
attempt
to
control
the
use,
operation
or
regulation
of
the
property.
when
the
tax
is
raised,
the
mission
of
a
property
tax
has
been
fulfilled.
the
property
tax
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
question
of
privilege,
license
or
permission.”
i
turn
in
the
time
remaining
to
the
second
issue
which
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
that
is
the
propriety
of
the
remedy
decreed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
court
understands,
i
trust
that
we
agree
with
the
illinois
supreme
court's
holding
on
the
invalidity
of
the
discrimination.
we
strongly
disagree
with
its
holding
on
the
remedy.
now
the
trial
court
in
lake
shore
has
sustained
our
position
that
the
appropriate
remedy
was
to
invalidate
the
tax
on
all
tax
payers,
the
personal
property
tax
on
all
taxpayers.
in
reaching
that
conclusion
the
trial
judge
considered
if
the
question
of
the
appropriate
remedy
was
essentially
one
of
ascertaining,
the
presumed
intention
of
the
people
at
illinois,
that
is
whether
they
would
have
approved
this
amendment
if
they
had
known
that
its
effect
was
going
to
be
to
abolish
personal
property
taxes
in
total.
and
in
an
oral
opinion
rendered
from
the
bench
of
the
trial
court
said,
“there
was
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
anyone
that
it
would
have
passed
overwhelmingly
even
without
the
words
as
to
individuals.”
it's
quoted
at
page
54
of
our
brief
and
page
46
in
the
record.
now
the
illinois
supreme
court
reversed
down
this
issue
and
in
doing
so
that
court
made
no
pretense
of
ascertaining
anyone’s
intention.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
under
traditional
holdings
on
this
subject
i
think
it
is.
i
recognize
that
how
one
goes
about
ascertaining
the
intention
of
the
people
on
the
subject
that
they
never
voted
on.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
think
theoretically
that's
--
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
your
honor
in
--
that's
of
course
a
touchy
question
because
i
am
aware
that
we
face
that
problem
over
here
and
i
cannot
say
with
any
great
confidence
that
it's
not
that
we
have
developed
the
argument
in
our
brief
at
considerable
length.
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
old
case
of
gwen
versus
united
states,
this
court
said
there
that
if
the
state
court
has
not
pronounced
state
law
on
the
subject
to
the
remedy
then
this
court
is
free
to
do
so.
now
in
subsequent
decisions
this
court
certainly
has
honored
the
standpoint
decision
where
the
state
court
has
made
a
finding
on
the
question
of
intention.
but
the
problem
with
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
decision
here,
they
made
no
pretense
of
finding
anything.
they
simply,
after
holding
the
discrimination
of
the
invalid
they
said
therefore
the
amendment
must
fall
and
there
is
not
a
reason
given,
one
could
read
that
opinion
i
suggest
time
after
time
and
not
know
why
they
reached
that
result
rather
than
the
result
reached
by
the
trial
court.
now
if
this
court
is
satisfied
that,
that
is
a
determination,
a
ruling,
a
finding
by
the
state
supreme
court
then
i
have
to
confess
i
am
beaten
because
the
court,
if
that
is
the
case
it
is
a
state
ruling.
we
have
argued
that
it
is
not
a
state
ruling.
we
further
argue
that
at
least
in
this
case
to
permit
this
sort
of
a
result
would
have
a
severely
chilling
effect
on
the
association
of
equal
protection
rights
at
least
in
the
field
of
taxation
because
if
a
taxpayer
knows
that
he
can't
win,
even
if
he
wins,
he
is
still
going
to
end
up
subject
to
the
tax.
there
are
very
many
people
going
to
challenge
taxing
statutes.
i
am
aware,
this
is
the
first
time
this
argument
has
been
advanced
in
a
property
case
context
as
distinguished
from
a
free
speech
or
voting
rights
case.
i
am
also
aware
that
this
court
quite
properly
has
accorded
priority
and
precedence
to
personal
rights
as
compared
to
property
rights.
but
i
think
--
at
least
i
hope
that
property
rights
are
still
a
matter
entitled
to
protection
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
i
think
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
can
do
this
to
us.
we
can
forget
about
any
challenges
to
any
taxing
statutes
in
illinois
at
least
and
i
might
say
that
there
are
now
on
the
books
of
illinois
to
my
knowledge
two
or
three
taxing
statutes
enacted
in
the
last
year
or
two
which
quite
obviously
are
unconstitutional
under
the
state
constitution.
nobody
has
brought
a
challenge
to
them
and
i
dare
say
nobody
is
going
to
because
they
foresee
the
kind
of
result
that
they
are
going
to
get.
we
have
argued
this
point
that
in
our
brief
at
some
length
i
kept
denying
the
problem
in
fact
we
have
at
one
point
thought
to
withdraw
from
this
case
after
the
court
denied
our
--
after
court
dismissed
our
appeal,
we
sought
to
appeal
as
the
court
recalls
directly
from
the
judgment
below
on
the
ground
that
the
remedy
violated
our
constitutional
rights.
the
court
dismissed
that
appeal
for
one
of
jurisdiction
and
at
that
point
feeling
rather
discouraged
we
asked
leave
to
get
out
entirely.
he
wouldn't
let
us
out
so
we
are
back
in
and
we
are
still
in
and
we
rethought
the
matter
and
i
hope
that
we
are
still
in
the
ball
game
on
this
issue.
i
say
we
are
opposed
on
the
question
of
the
remedy
most
vociferously
by
the
four
school
districts
which
are,
appear
in
this
court
as
amicus.
more
disturbingly
we
are
opposed
on
this
issue
by
m.
weil
&
sons,
one
of
the
respondents
in
the
shapiro
case
and
that's
disturbing
because
m.
weil
&
sons
purports
to
represent
a
class
of
all
corporations
including
lake
shore,
the
finding
of
that
effect
as
we
have
argued
is
clearly
void,
having
been
entered
without
semblance
of
due
process
of
law
but
nevertheless
having
reported
to
represent
all
corporations,
they
now
fix
the
position
that
the
court
below
is
correct,
ask
this
court
to
affirm
even
though
the
result
would
be
to
grant
no
benefit
at
all
to
any
corporations
including
lake
shore
and
including
m.
weil
&
sons
but
mr.
biro
will
address
the
court
on
that
subject
and
perhaps
he
can
explain
his
position.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
oh
no,
the
income
tax
has
been
effect
since
prior
to
the
adoption
of
any
of
this
amendment.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
well,
it's
supposed
to
be
a
flat
rate
tax.
it's
a
flat
rate
tax
with
a
differential
rate
on
corporations
and
individuals
with
rather
substantial
exemptions
to
it.
yes.
mr.
arnold
m.
flamm
at
presently
not
effective
you
honor,
and
it's
just
two
minutes
i
have
remaining,
i
would
address
myself
to
one
argument
that
has
been
made
here
and
has
been
made
the
school
districts
is
that
somehow
chaos
would
result
if
the
decision
below
were
affirmed
that
the
school
districts
would
lose
$300
million.
now
i
am
well
very
much
concerned
with
school
districts'
financing,
my
wife
happens
to
be
on
a
school
board
as
a
matter
of
fact.
so
i
get
both
sides
of
the
picture.
there
is
no
shortage
of
means
in
illinois
to
raise
alternative
sources
of
revenue.
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
