justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
scott,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the
constitutional
provision
that
justice
brennan
inquired
about,
which
is
on
the
footnote
on
page
4
of
your
brief.
supposing
that
the
legislature
of
illinois
does
nothing
more
than
it’s
already
done
between
now
and
1979
and
this
constitutional
provision
remains
as
it
is.
would
the
ad
valorem
tax
be
automatically
unconstitutional
as
of
1979?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
legislature
does
nothing
more
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kaplan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
the
page
a-15
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
i
think
it
must
be
at
the
last
page
of
justice
schaefer’s
majority
opinion,
he
says,
“we
hold
therefore
that
the
discrimination
produced
by
article
ix-a
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
apart
from
that,
discrimination
the
validity
of
the
revenue
act
is
not
challenged.”
now,
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
holding
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
flamm,
if
that
difference
which
the
attorney
general
put
between
downstate
and
chicago
is
correct,
that
would
suggest
that
it
is
very
largely
a
matter
of
visibility
rather
than
corporate
versus
individual?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
agree
that,
that's
the
question
that
was
upper
decision?
what
was
the
intent
of
the
legislature,
or
the
people
adopted
the
amendment
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
but
if
it's
true,
isn't
that
a
question
on
which
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
the
last
words
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned?
