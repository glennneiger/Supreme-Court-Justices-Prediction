as
i
understood,
one
of
the
arguments
that
you
have
alluded
to,
but
stressed
in
your
brief
is
that,
in
terms
of
trying
to
collect
this
tax
from
individuals,
it
was
totally
uneconomic
because
the
cost
was
more
than
the
reward
and
that
only
was
it
2%
of
the
total
tax
came
from
individuals,
and
98%
of
that
from

you
haven’t
addressed
yourself
to
the
power

well,
as
the
practical
matter
there
is
much
–
isn't
there
something
to
that
argument,
that
it
is
much
easier
because
corporations
for
the
most
part
have
got
to
keep
the
inventories.
they’ve
got
federal
tax
records

do
you
see
any
parallel
