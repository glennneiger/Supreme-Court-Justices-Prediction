justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
not
quite
clear
with
attorney
general.
i
gather
as
to
ad
valorem
taxes
against
corporations,
is
there
a
phasing
out
timetable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
in
some
--
is
that
in
a
provision
of
the
an
existing
constitution
or
something
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
actually
written
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
automatically
will
become
effective
unless
the
constitution
was
again
amended?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
you
say
earlier
if
i
may
interrupt,
there
is
$300
million
raised
by
the
property
tax
against
corporations
alone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
raised
by
taxes
only
against
corporations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
the
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
the
first
step
was
to
eliminate
the
property
taxes
against
the
individuals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
then
when
does
the
next
step
became
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
any
other
could
mean
only
taxes
against
corporations
--
property
tax
against
corporations,
could
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i’m
still
puzzled
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still
don’t
understand.
do
you
have
anywhere
a
reference
to
the
actual
language
of
your
constitutional
convention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
give
me
just
the
page
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
at
page
four
of
your
brief
in
that
footnote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
is
not
self-operative,
it
requires
a
law
of
the
general
assembly
abolishing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
the
legislature
didn’t
do
what
this
requires
it
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
familiar,
in
my
own
state
of
constitutional
provisions
which
have
directed
the
legislature
something
back
in
1947,
and
haven’t
done
it
yet?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
or
has
the
general
assembly
has
yet
introduced
any
legislation,
pursuant
to
sub-section
c
yet?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
are
you
suggesting
that
the
new
income
tax
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
compensating
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
mr.
attorney
general
that
your
answer
to
justice
rehnquist
is
that
automatically
even
if
your
legislature
does
nothing
under
section
c,
on
january
1,
1979,
the
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax,
even
as
against
corporations,
would
this
abolish?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
your
legislature
does
nothing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
this
requires
them
to
do,
nevertheless
are
you
saying
that
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,

alright.
