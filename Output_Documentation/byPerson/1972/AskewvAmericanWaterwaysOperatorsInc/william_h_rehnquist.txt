mr.
dearing
if
knickerbocker

company,
the
court
held
that
a
land
based
employee’s
workmen’s
compensation
claim
couldn’t
be
enforced
by
the
state
because
it
was
sufficiently
closely
related
to
the
admiralty,
surely
the
type
of
oil
spillage
you’re
talking
about
here
is
a
good
deal
more
closely
related
to
traditional
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
what
the
court
was
talking
about
the
knickerbocker,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
those
cases?
justice
william

rehnquist
and
that
wouldn’t
be
true
if
these
were
they’re
just
a
commerce
power
on
land,
whether
congress
wants
to
say
the
states
can
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
principle
of
law
that
prevents
the
states
from
having
concurrent
jurisdiction.
so
your
depending
basically
in

admiralty
approached
to
it?
