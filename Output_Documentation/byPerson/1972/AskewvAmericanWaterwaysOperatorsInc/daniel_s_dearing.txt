mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
middle
district
of
florida
wherein
a
three-judge
panel
struck
the
florida
oil
spill
prevention
and
pollution
control
act
in
1970.
with
permission
of
the
court,
the
argument
will
be
divided
between
myself
and
the
attorney
general
robert
l.
shevin,
state
of
florida
and
i
understand
that
the
argument
will
also
be
divided
to
the
appellees.
essentially,
the
operating
facts
or
the
operative
facts
bring
in
this
matter
before
the
court
today
of
the
passage
in
1970
by
the
florida
legislature
of
its
oil
spill
prevention
and
pollution
control
act.
now
this
act,
like
most
legislation
was
a
result
of
recent
history.
the
florida
legislature
was
not
unaware
of
the
serious
and
deleterious
effects
of
oil
spills,
massive
oil
spills
in
state
waters.
they
are
aware,
all
too
aware
of
the
results
in
the
torrey
canyon
disaster
and
the
english
channel
in
1967.
they
are
too
aware
also
of
spills
up
country.
for
instance
when
the
p.w.
thirtle
went
down
and
spilled
31,000
gallons
of
bunker
sea
oil
into
narragansett
bay
off
to
close
to
rhode
island
was
reported
to
have
ruined
the
fishing
industry
in
narragansett
bay
as
a
pertain
to
oils
spillage.
they
were
aware
also
that
the
united
states
congress
was
considering
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
they
are
aware
of
the
laborious
steps
taken
by
the
various
committees
and
the
passage
of
this
legislation.
the
florida
legislature
had
convened
and
had
been
in
session
for
only
a
few
weeks
when
this
matter
came
before
its
attention.
the
real
impetus
to
the
florida
act
however
was
the
collision
in
collision
in
tampa
bay
of
the
tanker
dealing
the
pump,
and
the
spillage
of
21,000
gallons
of
bunker
fuel
oil
into
tampa
bay.
this
brought
home
adequately
and
clearly
to
the
legislature
the
dangers
involved
and
being
vulnerable
as
the
state
is
to
the
ravages
of
oil
spill
pollution
of
its
territory
waters
and
so
the
legislature
met
and
passed
this
act.
the
florida
oil
spill
prevention
and
pollution
control
act
which
provides
for
absolute
and
unlimited
liability
against
the
owners
of
vessels,
in
any
event,
other
major
spill
and
which
also
provides
for
certain
mechanics
for
the
--
before
the
fact
enforcement
of
the
act
itself.
shortly,
before
the
act
was
to
go
into
effect
that
is
to
say
the
financial
responsibility
provisions
which
are
going
to
the
effect
the
appellees
before
the
court
today,
plaintiff
below
file
suit
challenging
constitutionality
of
the
act
on
several
grounds.
the
lower
court,
the
state
defendant
on
the
grounds
that
the
act
was
a
valid
expression
of
the
state’s
police
power.
but
the
lower
court
decided
that
instead
of
being
a
valid
expression
of
the
state’s
police
power
it
was
in
fact
an
intrusion
into
an
exclusive
federal
admiralty
domain
and
although
the
act
was
challenged
on
other
grounds,
the
court
below
decided
issue
on
that
fact
alone,
in
that
decision
alone.
now
the
florida,
i
think
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
bring
the
court
--
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
two
sections
of
the
act.
first
of
all,
section
2
which
sets
forth
the
legislative
intent
contains
this
very
brief
but
important
paragraph.
it
says
the
legislative
further
declares
that
it
is
the
intent
of
this
act
to
support
and
complement
applicable
provisions
of
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970
and
in
section
21
of
the
act
states
that
this
act
being
necessary
for
the
general
welfare
the
public
health,
the
public
safety
of
the
state
and
its
inhabitants
shall
be
liberally
construed
to
effect
the
purposes
set
forth
under
this
act
and
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
was
to
issue
certain
regulations
going
to
the
mechanics
of
enforcement.
these
regulations,
it
is
submitted
must
reflect
the
intent
as
set
forth
in
this
two
phrases,
the
regulations
as
well
as
all
other
enforcement
provisions
of
this
act,
it
is
submitted,
would
have
to
comply
and
supplement
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970
and
this
is
particularly
important
to
the
position
of
the
state
of
florida
before
the
court
today.
now,
the
court
--
the
lower
court
found
that
the
act
violated
provisions
of
uniformity
absolutely
necessary
to
the
federal
admiralty
maritime
domain.
now,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
true.
in
the
first
place,
we
submit
that
the
concern
with
prevention
and
control
of
oil
spill
collision
of
territorial
waters
is
not
a
maritime
matter
at
all.
but
if
it
is,
it
is
certainly
a
non-exclusive
maritime
matter
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
both
the
state
and
the
federal
governments
and
we
would
illustrate
that
fact.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
no,
your
honor
we
don’t
mean
without
any
shoreside
damage.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
if
there
is
no
shoreside
damage
then
the
state
may
not
have
any
interest
in
the
area
to
protect.
we
would
submit
however
in
response
to
the
question
that
the
ecological
balance
which
is
interrupted
by
a
spill
even
though
the
slick
never
touches
shore
has
a
very
detrimental
and
adverse
effect
shoreside.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
mr.
justice
white
it
certainly
has
an
application
there
but
it
also
has
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
the
state
does
not
purport
to
have
any
responsibility
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
our
answer
is
no.
the
question
is
i
think,
in
that
instance
whether
there
is
any
adverse
effect
shoreside
and
only
then
does
the
state
purport
to
represent
to
have
any
concern
or
interest
in
the
matter
that
would
give
rise
to
the
police
officer.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
the
state
does
not
so
interpret
it,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
the
state
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
i
believe
the
state
that
the
congress
had
authority
under
the
commerce
power
to
exercise
and
it
did
so
exercises
this
power
under
in
the
act
itself,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
no
sir,
we
do
not
and
we
would
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
yes
sir,
we
think
it
makes
a
considerable
difference.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
i’m
sorry.
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
no,
sir.
it
would
not
make
any
difference
at
all
if
the
florida
act
it
conflicts
with
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
yes,
sir.
to
be
more
specific,
they
said
that
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
was
proof
positive
or
strong
indication
in
the
area
that
of
the
conflict
that
their
conflict
existed
and
we
construed
that
to
be
or
we
interpret
that
as
being
giving
grasp
to
the
pre-emption
question
which
is
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
we
believe
it’s
important
not
only
because
we’re
appealing
from
an
order
that
stated
this
was
applicable
that
provisions
of
maritime
law
applied
here.
we
maintained
that
they
do
not.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
commerce
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
--
mr.
justice
brennan.
yes.
we
submit
that
the
reason.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
yes
it
would
for
reasons
if
i
may
just
the
address
myself
briefly
to
it
at
this
point.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
this
is
what
the
court
said
below
and
this
is
what
we
take
issue
with.
we
don’t
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
(a)
if
there
is
any
admiralty
jurisdiction
at
all
it
isn’t
exclusive,
it’s
concurrent
and
in
(b)
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
reason
it
is
not
admiralty
or
maritime
is
because
of
traditional
view
of
this
court.
this
is
based
upon
the
premise
that
the
court
and
the
court
alone
can
determine
the
limits
of
the
maritime
grant
under
the
constitution.
congress
cannot
determine
those
limits.
only
this
court
can
construe
the
constitution.
this
court
has
so
construed
the
constitution
and
defined
the
limits
of
the
maritime
grant
as
being
and
applying
the
locality
test,
those
occurrences
which
occur
on
navigable
waters.
a
sea
to
shore
toward
being
consummated
ashore
is
beyond
the
purview
of
that
low
county
test
limitation.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
yes,
sir.
we
would
agree
that
the
incidental
effect
of
the
legislation
on
maritime
law
would
be
much
more
emphatic
than
would
be
the
workman’s
compensation
laws
at
issue
in
jensen
and
reflected
in
the
knickerbocker
case.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
we
would
ask
the
court
to
continue
the
statement
that
appeared
in
the
standard
dredging
case
and
severely
limit
the
knickerbocker,
the
jensen
doctrine
to
its
facts
of
workman’s
compensation
cases
which
is
what
this
court
said
of
course
in
the
standard
dredging
case
that
jensen
is
limited
to
its
facts
and
if
we
may,
there
is
an
alternative
to
looking
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
strict
point
of
view
of
maritime
law
and
i
would
invite
the
court’s
attention
at
this
time
to
what
the
attorney
general
has
to
say
and
i
respect.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
middle
district
of
florida
wherein
a
three-judge
panel
struck
the
florida
oil
spill
prevention
and
pollution
control

in
1970.
with
permission
of
the

the

will
be
divided
between
myself
and
the

robert
l.
shevin,
state
of

and
i
understand
that
the

will
also
be
divided
to
the

essentially,
the

or
the

bring
in
this

of
the

now
this

the

on

it

now
the
florida,
i
think
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
bring
the
court
--
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
two
sections
of
the
act.
first
of
all,
section
2
which
sets
forth
the
legislative
intent
contains
this
very
brief
but
important
paragraph.
it
says
the
legislative
further
declares
that
it
is
the
intent
of
this
act
to
support
and
complement
applicable
provisions
of
the
federal

and
in
section

of
the

states
that
this
act
being

the
general

the
public
health,
the
public

of

and
its

shall
be
liberally
construed
to
effect
the
purposes
set
forth
under
this
act
and
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
was
to
issue
certain
regulations
going
to
the
mechanics
of
enforcement.
these
regulations,
it
is
submitted
must
reflect
the
intent
as
set
forth
in
this
two

the
regulations
as

as

provisions
of
this

it
is
submitted,
would
have
to
comply
and
supplement
the
federal
water
quality

act
of
1970
and
this
is
particularly
important
to
the
position
of
the
state
of
florida
before
the
court
today.
now,
the
court
--
the
lower
court
found
that
the
act
violated
provisions
of
uniformity
absolutely
necessary
to
the
federal
admiralty
maritime
domain.
now,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
true.
in
the
first
place,
we
submit
that
the
concern
with
prevention
and
control
of
oil
spill
collision
of
territorial
waters
is
not
a
maritime
matter
at

but
if
it
is,
it
is
certainly
a
non-exclusive
maritime
matter
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
both
the
state
and
the
federal
governments
and
we
would
illustrate
that
fact.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
no,
your
honor
we
don’t
mean
without
any
shoreside
damage.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
if
there
is
no
shoreside
damage
then
the
state
may
not
have
any
interest
in
the

to

we
would
submit
however
in

to

mr.

mr.

it

it
also
has

mr.

the

does
not
purport
to
have
any
responsibility
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
our
answer
is
no.
the
question
is
i
think,
in
that
instance
whether
there
is
any
adverse
effect
shoreside
and
only
then
does
the
state
purport
to
represent
to
have
any
concern
or
interest
in
the
matter
that
would
give
rise
to
the
police
officer.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
the
state
does
not
so
interpret
it,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel

dearing
the
state
--
mr.

dearing
i
believe
the
state
that

exercises
this

mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
no
sir,
we
do
not
and
we
would
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
yes
sir,
we
think
it
makes
a
considerable
difference.
mr.
daniel

dearing
i’m

i
beg

mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
no,
sir.
it
would
not
make
any
difference
at
all
if
the
florida
act
it
conflicts
with
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
yes,
sir.
to
be
more
specific,
they
said
that
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
was
proof
positive
or
strong
indication
in
the
area
that
of
the
conflict
that
their
conflict
existed
and
we
construed
that
to
be
or
we
interpret
that
as
being
giving
grasp
to
the
pre-emption
question
which
is
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
we
believe
it’s
important
not
only
because
we’re
appealing
from
an
order
that
stated
this
was
applicable
that
provisions
of
maritime
law
applied
here.
we
maintained
that
they
do
not.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
commerce
--
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
--
mr.
justice
brennan.
yes.
we
submit
that
the
reason.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
yes
it
would
for
reasons
if
i
may
just
the
address
myself
briefly
to
it
at
this
point.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
this
is
what
the
court
said
below
and
this
is
what
we
take
issue
with.
we
don’t
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
(a)
if
there
is
any
admiralty
jurisdiction
at
all
it
isn’t
exclusive,
it’s
concurrent
and
in
(b)
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
reason
it
is
not
admiralty
or
maritime
is
because
of
traditional
view
of
this
court.
this
is
based
upon
the
premise
that
the
court
and
the
court
alone
can
determine
the
limits
of
the
maritime
grant
under
the
constitution.
congress
cannot
determine
those
limits.
only
this
court
can
construe
the
constitution.
this
court
has
so
construed
the
constitution
and
defined
the
limits
of
the
maritime
grant
as
being
and
applying
the
locality
test,
those
occurrences
which
occur
on
navigable
waters.
a
sea
to
shore
toward
being
consummated
ashore
is
beyond
the
purview
of
that
low
county
test
limitation.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
yes,
sir.
we
would
agree
that
the
incidental
effect
of
the
legislation
on
maritime
law
would
be
much
more
emphatic
than
would
be
the
workman’s
compensation
laws
at
issue
in
jensen
and
reflected
in
the
knickerbocker
case.
mr.
daniel
s.
dearing
we
would
ask
the
court
to
continue
the
statement
that
appeared
in
the
standard
dredging
case
and
severely
limit
the
knickerbocker,
the
jensen
doctrine
to
its
facts
of
workman’s
compensation
cases
which
is
what
this
court
said
of
course
in
the
standard
dredging
case
that
jensen
is
limited
to
its
facts
and
if
we
may,
there
is
an
alternative
to
looking
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
strict
point
of
view
of
maritime
law
and
i
would
invite
the
court’s
attention
at
this
time
to
what
the
attorney
general
has
to
say
and
i
respect.
thank
you.
