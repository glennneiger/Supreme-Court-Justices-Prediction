mr.
leroy
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
respect
very
highly
attorney
general
but
i
find
that
some
of
his
statements
here
to
be
frankly
incredible.
when
he
makes
a
flat
statement
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
state
act
and
the
federal
laws,
i
think
his
badly
wrong
as
i’d
like
to
try
to
demonstrate.
in
fact,
the
district
court
after
considering
this
case
found
that
there
were
so
much
in
conflict
and
so
much
wrong
about
the
state
act
that
if
it
were
stripped
of
all
of
its
conflicts
there
would
be
no
viable
act
left
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
have
not
considered
that
there
was
any
question
of
severability
the
remaining
of
course
i
don’t
deny
that
this
court
would
have
every
opportunity
he
did
ask
to
deal
with
the
case
in
that
way.
but
the
pilot
himself
in
his
brief
acknowledges
that
there
is
no
basis
of
severability
here
and
we
strongly
make
that
contention
too.
there
was
no
question
raised
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
regarding
severability
and
so
we
do
not
believed
that
question
is
properly
before
this
court
on
the
initiative
of
the
parties
involved
here.
the
thing
i
would
like
first
of
all
to
emphasize
is
the
fact
that,
what
florida
really
seeks
to
do
here
is
to
establish
in
the
words
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme.
it’s
not
just
an
act
dealing
with
these
couple
of
matters
of
liability
without
thought
and
limitation
of
liability.
the
state
of
florida
puts
itself
in
the
business
of
regulating,
what
is
obviously,
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
it
regulates
it
in
a
very
comprehensive
way.
this
involves
to
control
and
regulation
of
ships
as
state
act
does.
it
involves
terminals
that
exist
for
the
purpose
of
servicing
to
those
ships.
it
involves
navigation
in
the
navigable
water
of
the
united
states
very
importantly.
this
total
scheme
is
what
the
district
court
invalidated
and
what
we
feel
this
court
should
do.
let
me
refer
to
just
a
few
of
the
provisions
of
this
law
that
haven’t
been
mentioned
here
at
all.
the
law
provides
of
course
for
licensing
of
these
terminals
in
the
issuance
of
certificates
of
registration
for
them
annually
provided,
the
terminals
demonstrate
that
they
have
certain
equipment
on
hand
and
that
they
are
disposed
to
cooperate
completely
with
the
state
and
in
any
program
of
prevention
and
correction
of
oil
spills.
and
it
follows
this
language,
the
department
that’s
the
state
department
shall
adopt
regulations
to
govern
operating
and
inspection
requirements
for
facilities,
vessels,
personnel
and
other
matters
related
to
licensee
operations
under
this
act
and
specifically
requiring
that
vessels,
transporting
pollutants
within
state
waters
shall
maintain
on
board
such
containment
gear
as
may
be
required
by
the
department
that
it
is
to
state
with
a
crew
trained
in
the
use
of
such
gear.
now
this
is
what
the
state
is
seeking
to
do.
the
states
further
makes
provisions
under
this
law
for
the
designation
of
support
managers
and
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
duties
and
obligations
and
rights
of
these
port
managers.
they
are
to
organize
recover
teams,
that’s
understandable
although
the
federal
law
provides
for
what
they
call
strike
forces
which
is
the
same
function
really.
these
port
managers
are
authorize
to
board
vessels
that
out
there
they
are
going
to
come
into
the
port
to
inspect
these
vessels
for
the
seaworthiness
and
of
course
that
can
include
a
great
many
things
and
to
decide
whether
in
their
opinion
the
port
manager,
the
state
manages
a
few
it
is
seaworthy
and
decide
whether
it
has
a
proper
gear
on
it
and
decide
whether
its
crews
have
been
trained
suitably
to
allow
to
them
to
enter
one
of
florida’s
level
deep-water
ports.
the
port
manager
also
has
the
right
after
he
stops
the
ships
out
there
to
tell
them
that
he
must
anchor,
he
can’t
come
in
now
because
of
whether
conditions
and
if
he
does
come
in,
he
can
tell
him
where
to
go
and
where
to
stop
and
other
things
at
a
purely
operation
and
navigation
limit
completely
covered
by
coast
guard
services
and
other
federal
services
at
the
present
time.
the
law
also
provide
for
the
preparation
of
a
contingency
claim.
invite
--
involving
all
the
agencies
of
the
state
government
to
help
it
enforce
all
of
these
provisions
and
to
help
provide
remedies
for
spill
if
it
occurs.
this
of
course
is
patterned
directly
after
the
federal
government.
the
1970
water
quality
improvement
act
was
passed
to
defense
of
this
act
and
obviously,
the
federal
act
was
before
the
draft
of
this
act
and
was
used
as
a
model
somewhat.
what
the
state
was
just
trying
to
do
is
do
all
the
federal
governments
going
to
do
and
do
much
more
in
conflict
with
some
of
the
things
the
federal
government
provided.
now,
in
doing
all
these
things
as
port
managers
authorized
to
do,
he
runs
squarely
into
the
coast
guard
and
its
responsibilities.
this
is
a
comprehensive
federal
contingency
plan
and
there
is
a
federal
contingency
plan
responsibility
for
recovery
spills
and
strike
forces
and
all
of
these
things
are
all
provided
under
that
federal
law
and
the
coast
guard,
the
federal
authorities
of
course
have
authority
to
prevent
ships
from
coming
in
and
giving
them
directions
at
which
the
state
is
putting
itself
in
business
of
doing
so.
here
you
have
very
specific
conflicts
but
these
conflicts
are
just
the
beginning.
this
navigational
management
of
conflicts
because
both
state
and
the
federal
require
showing
the
financial
responsibility,
the
state
makes
no
provision
for
accepting
and
showing
that
the
federal
government
requires
a
financial
responsibility.
this
imposes
its
own
making
it
a
little
tougher
and
there
is
a
provision
that
and
i
don’t
know
just
how
this
should
be
interpreted
but
in
all
these
where
the
cost
guard
and
the
state
teams
move
together
while
it’s
a
provision
that
the
state
shall
act
independently
of
the
federal
authorities.
mr.
leroy
collins
yes
sir,
that’s
absolutely
sir.
and
of
course
we
go
and
that
there
are
all
these
conflicts
regarding
the
extent
of
liability
limitation
and
non-limitation
of
liability,
the
state
deprives
people
of
rights
and
defenses
in
very
harsh
terms
that
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
terms,
and
all
of
these
other
things
that
are
mentioned
herewith.
now,
and
the
state
frankly
insist
that
its
law
supersede
those
of
the
federal
government
in
these
respects.
and
we
say
that
it
is
a
congress’
responsibility
to
regulate
in
this
field
and
it
must
be
the
congress’
responsibility
to
regulate
in
this
field.
we
are
proud
about
beaches
and
of
course
we
want
to
protect
them
why
therefore
denying
other
states
of
the
union
who
are
equally
proud
of
those
that
they
have
or
may
have
and
this
is
a
matter
that
requiring
uniformity
of
action
and
that
action
can
only
come
through
federal
leadership
and
federal
direction.
a
room
for
the
states
to
cooperate
but
this
is
not
any
way
for
the
state
to
seek
to
cooperate
with
the
federal
government
in
its
comprehensive
plan
to
deal
with
this
very
difficult
problem.
now,
i
think
the
best
of
all
the
cases
and
very
essentially
that
dealing
with
this
matter
of
federal
state
relations
and
responsibilities
in
the
admiralty
field
is
kelly
against
washington.
and
there
you
have
read
pervasive
state
statute
that
sought
to
provide
inspection
of
boats
and
ships
that
were
not
provided
to
be
inspected
by
the
federal
government
and
do
all
kinds
of
boats,
some
of
them
foreign
commerce,
some
in
the
interstate
commerce,
some
in
intrastate
commerce.
and
the
state
supreme
court
there
held
that
that
act
was
an
improper
innovation
of
the
federal
admiralty
domain
though
it
did
apply
only
to
ships
not
subject
to
federal
inspection.
and
the
case
came
up
here
and
justice
hughes
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
he
sets
out
very
clearly
the
three
governing
rules
that
apply
and
i
think
applied
right
here.
first,
he
says
is
there
a
conflict
with
federal
law?
he
says
if
there’s
a
conflict
with
federal
law,
the
federal
law
prevailed
because
it
is
paramount
and
the
state
law
fails.
secondly
he
says,
if
the
subject
is
one
demanding
uniformity
whether
a
conflict
or
not
that
the
state
action
will
not
be
permissible.
well,
we
submit
here
we
have
a
proposition
that
does
require
uniformity
of
dealing.
then
he
said
that
there
was
room
for
a
state
to
deal
with
purely
local
exigencies
when
there
was
neither
conflict
nor
a
necessity
for
uniformity
and
some
very
limited
action
was
allowed
the
state
to
act
in
this
area
pending
action
by
the
federal
government.
now,
those
are
the
--
that’s
a
modern
rule
for
protecting
the
maritime,
a
jurisdiction
and
administration
of
this
nation
and
it
does
belong
to
this
country
and
if
doesn’t
belong
to
the
several
states
because
that
has
a
countrywide
responsibility
and
a
nationwide
responsibility
and
i
submit
that
on
all
three
of
those
considerations
that
this
act
fails.
they
argued
that
hereon
which
cited
the
kelly
against
washington
case.
the
case
of
michigan
over
there
was
a
municipal
coordinate
dealing
with
smoke
intensity
and
the
court
allowed
that
to
stand.
they
claimed
that
that
where
there’s
a
--
was
a
departure
from
kelly
against
washington.
it
was
really
an
effort
by
the
court
to
adjust
to
that
little
local
room
there,
a
local
exigency,
the
particular
situation
which
provided
the
misdemeanor
for
a
ship
to
be
emitting
smoke
in
the
city
limits
of
detroit.
mr.
leroy
collins
no
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
leroy
collins
yes,
it
was
claimed
that
federal
inspections
were
required
of
this
and
this
particular
type
of
(inaudible)
met
with
federal
inspections
and
there
was
a
strong
dissent
in
that
case
that
my
personal
feeling
would
follow
actually,
that
was
by
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
douglas.
but
even
so
that’s
just
a
tiny,
tiny
island
there
that
that
cannot
be
possibly
be
a
base
of
foreign
act
that
this
is
as
far
reaching
this
as
this
went
years.
so
we
say
it
is
up
to
the
congress
to
say
what
the
(inaudible)
is
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
congress
had
not
been
lax
in
its
interest
in
this
matter.
it
is
move
very
importantly
over
the
last
25
years
that
to
meet
needs
that
arising
in
this
matter
of
greater
and
greater
demand
for
more
and
more
shipping
of
oil
to
meet
the
greater
and
greater
demand
for
electric
power
this
country
and
that
same
thing
is
true
all
over
the
world.
this
is
a
serious
problem
but
it’s
not
one
that
the
congress
is
not
aware
of.
it’s
not
one
that
the
congress
didn’t
moving
very
specifically
and
very
importantly
to
meet.
in
our
case,
there
is
conflict,
the
united
states
is
exercising
its
paramount
power
and
the
state
is
seeking
in
to
supersede
this.
in
our
case,
there
is
a
necessity
for
uniformity.
they
argue
about.
they
can’t
possibly
say
that
this
matter
of
controlling
this
kind
of
navigational
operation
and
experienced
is
a
local
matter.
but
we
could
have
an
oil
spill
at
pensacola
that
might
not
hurt
pensacola
totally
and
might
wind
up
in
mobile
and
it
creates
a
problem
in
that
state.
now
supposed
to
use
a
hypothetical
case
we
had
a
spill
up
near
new
york
and
it
got
to
go
stream
and
started
drifting
up
the
new
england
coast
there.
well,
if
they
applied
the
law
that
the
attorney
general
is
seeking
to
uphold
here
then
you
will
have
a
new
york
state.
a
team
out
there
trying
to
deal
with
this
matter
and
telling
the
master
of
the
ship
what
to
do
with
the
ship
and
how
to
handle
it
and
trying
to
manage
a
team
and
then
when
did
this
spill
across
the
stateline
and
you
got
into
connecticut
while
here’s
another
state
out
there
with
another
team
and
whole
regulations
and
more
controlled
and
different
ones
and
so
it
goes
the
main
you’ve
have
the
same
sort
of
thing.
this
is
definitely
an
area
which
we
require
uniformity
and
requires
the
kind
of
action
that
the
federal
government
is
applied
at
the
present
time.
in
the
national
conventions
of
a
dealing
with
this
subject
and
importantly
and
of
course
this
would
supersede
any
state
regulation.
the
ship
as
i
represent
do
not
seek
to
avoid
regulation
concerning
oil
spills.
on
the
contrary,
they
had
worked
with
congress
and
continued
to
do
so
in
relation
to
oils
spill
legislation.
however,
this
ship
was
worked
daily
in
the
complexities
of
the
federal
admiralty
scheme
and
they
realized
as
a
practical
matter
and
impossible
situation
would
exist
if
states
were
free
to
legislate
within
the
area
of
oil
spill
control
as
florida
seeks
to
do.
there
is
a
better
way
now.
there
is
a
better
way
then
for
each
state
to
try
to
outdo
the
federal
government.
we’re
all
in
this
together,
the
state
act
should
be
found
invalid
here
at
the
district
court
has.
and
the
interested
state
should
then
find
ways
to
exhibit
their
effectiveness
in
the
formulation
support
and
execution
of
federal
policy
in
this
field
and
there
is
no
lack
of
federal
power,
there
is
no
disposition
by
our
federal
leadership
not
to
move,
there’s
no
lack
of
awareness
of
the
states
involved
for
florida
and
all
the
sister
states
as
well.
so
we
submit
the
case,
the
decision
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
leroy
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
respect
very
highly
attorney
general
but
i
find
that
some
of
his
statements
here
to
be
frankly
incredible.
when
he
makes
a
flat
statement
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
state
act
and
the
federal
laws,
i
think
his
badly
wrong
as
i’d
like
to
try
to
demonstrate.
in
fact,
the
district
court
after
considering
this
case
found
that
there
were
so
much
in
conflict
and
so
much
wrong
about
the
state
act
that
if
it
were
stripped
of
all
of
its
conflicts
there
would
be
no
viable
act
left
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
have
not
considered
that
there
was
any
question
of
severability
the
remaining
of
course
i
don’t
deny
that
this
court
would
have
every
opportunity
he
did
ask
to
deal
with
the
case
in
that
way.
but
the
pilot
himself
in
his
brief
acknowledges
that
there
is
no
basis
of
severability
here
and
we
strongly
make
that
contention
too.
there
was
no
question
raised
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
regarding
severability
and
so
we
do
not
believed
that
question
is
properly
before
this
court
on
the
initiative
of
the
parties
involved
here.
the
thing
i
would
like
first
of
all
to
emphasize
is
the
fact
that,
what
florida
really
seeks
to
do
here
is
to
establish
in
the
words
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme.
it’s
not
just
an
act
dealing
with
these
couple
of
matters
of
liability
without
thought
and
limitation
of
liability.
the
state
of
florida
puts
itself
in
the
business
of
regulating,
what
is
obviously,
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
it
regulates
it
in
a
very
comprehensive
way.
this
involves
to
control
and
regulation
of
ships
as
state
act
does.
it
involves
terminals
that
exist
for
the
purpose
of
servicing
to
those
ships.
it
involves
navigation
in
the
navigable
water
of
the
united
states
very
importantly.
this
total
scheme
is
what
the
district
court
invalidated
and
what
we
feel
this
court
should
do.
let
me
refer
to
just
a
few
of
the
provisions
of
this
law
that
haven’t
been
mentioned
here
at
all.
the
law
provides
of
course
for
licensing
of
these
terminals
in
the
issuance
of
certificates
of
registration
for
them
annually
provided,
the
terminals
demonstrate
that
they
have
certain
equipment
on
hand
and
that
they
are
disposed
to
cooperate
completely
with
the
state
and
in
any
program
of
prevention
and
correction
of
oil
spills.
and
it
follows
this
language,
the
department
that’s
the
state
department
shall
adopt
regulations
to
govern
operating
and
inspection
requirements
for
facilities,
vessels,
personnel
and
other
matters
related
to
licensee
operations
under
this
act
and
specifically
requiring
that
vessels,
transporting
pollutants
within
state
waters
shall
maintain
on
board
such
containment
gear
as
may
be
required
by
the
department
that
it
is
to
state
with
a
crew
trained
in
the
use
of
such
gear.
now
this
is
what
the
state
is
seeking
to
do.
the
states
further
makes
provisions
under
this
law
for
the
designation
of
support
managers
and
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
duties
and
obligations
and
rights
of
these
port
managers.
they
are
to
organize
recover
teams,
that’s
understandable
although
the
federal
law
provides
for
what
they
call
strike
forces
which
is
the
same
function
really.
these
port
managers
are
authorize
to
board
vessels
that
out
there
they
are
going
to
come
into
the
port
to
inspect
these
vessels
for
the
seaworthiness
and
of
course
that
can
include
a
great
many
things
and
to
decide
whether
in
their
opinion
the
port
manager,
the
state
manages
a
few
it
is
seaworthy
and
decide
whether
it
has
a
proper
gear
on
it
and
decide
whether
its
crews
have
been
trained
suitably
to
allow
to
them
to
enter
one
of
florida’s
level
deep-water
ports.
the
port
manager
also
has
the
right
after
he
stops
the
ships
out
there
to
tell
them
that
he
must
anchor,
he
can’t
come
in
now
because
of
whether
conditions
and
if
he
does
come
in,
he
can
tell
him
where
to
go
and
where
to
stop
and
other
things
at
a
purely
operation
and
navigation
limit
completely
covered
by
coast
guard
services
and
other
federal
services
at
the
present
time.
the
law
also
provide
for
the
preparation
of
a
contingency
claim.
invite
--
involving
all
the
agencies
of
the
state
government
to
help
it
enforce
all
of
these
provisions
and
to
help
provide
remedies
for
spill
if
it
occurs.
this
of
course
is
patterned
directly
after
the
federal
government.
the
1970
water
quality
improvement
act
was
passed
to
defense
of
this
act
and
obviously,
the
federal
act
was
before
the
draft
of
this
act
and
was
used
as
a
model
somewhat.
what
the
state
was
just
trying
to
do
is
do
all
the
federal
governments
going
to
do
and
do
much
more
in
conflict
with
some
of
the
things
the
federal
government
provided.
now,
in
doing
all
these
things
as
port
managers
authorized
to
do,
he
runs
squarely
into
the
coast
guard
and
its
responsibilities.
this
is
a
comprehensive
federal
contingency
plan
and
there
is
a
federal
contingency
plan
responsibility
for
recovery
spills
and
strike
forces
and
all
of
these
things
are
all
provided
under
that
federal
law
and
the
coast
guard,
the
federal
authorities
of
course
have
authority
to
prevent
ships
from
coming
in
and
giving
them
directions
at
which
the
state
is
putting
itself
in
business
of
doing
so.
here
you
have
very
specific
conflicts
but
these
conflicts
are
just
the
beginning.
this
navigational
management
of
conflicts
because
both
state
and
the
federal
require
showing
the
financial
responsibility,
the
state
makes
no
provision
for
accepting
and
showing
that
the
federal
government
requires
a
financial
responsibility.
this
imposes
its
own
making
it
a
little
tougher
and
there
is
a
provision
that
and
i
don’t
know
just
how
this
should
be
interpreted
but
in
all
these
where
the
cost
guard
and
the
state
teams
move
together
while
it’s
a
provision
that
the
state
shall
act
independently
of
the
federal
authorities.
mr.
leroy
collins
yes
sir,
that’s
absolutely
sir.
and
of
course
we
go
and
that
there
are
all
these
conflicts
regarding
the
extent
of
liability
limitation
and
non-limitation
of
liability,
the
state
deprives
people
of
rights
and
defenses
in
very
harsh
terms
that
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
terms,
and
all
of
these
other
things
that
are
mentioned
herewith.
now,
and
the
state
frankly
insist
that
its
law
supersede
those
of
the
federal
government
in
these
respects.
and
we
say
that
it
is
a
congress’
responsibility
to
regulate
in
this
field
and
it
must
be
the
congress’
responsibility
to
regulate
in
this
field.
we
are
proud
about
beaches
and
of
course
we
want
to
protect
them
why
therefore
denying
other
states
of
the
union
who
are
equally
proud
of
those
that
they
have
or
may
have
and
this
is
a
matter
that
requiring
uniformity
of
action
and
that
action
can
only
come
through
federal
leadership
and
federal
direction.
a
room
for
the
states
to
cooperate
but
this
is
not
any
way
for
the
state
to
seek
to
cooperate
with
the
federal
government
in
its
comprehensive
plan
to
deal
with
this
very
difficult
problem.
now,
i
think
the
best
of
all
the
cases
and
very
essentially
that
dealing
with
this
matter
of
federal
state
relations
and
responsibilities
in
the
admiralty
field
is
kelly
against
washington.
and
there
you
have
read
pervasive
state
statute
that
sought
to
provide
inspection
of
boats
and
ships
that
were
not
provided
to
be
inspected
by
the
federal
government
and
do
all
kinds
of
boats,
some
of
them
foreign
commerce,
some
in
the
interstate
commerce,
some
in
intrastate
commerce.
and
the
state
supreme
court
there
held
that
that
act
was
an
improper
innovation
of
the
federal
admiralty
domain
though
it
did
apply
only
to
ships
not
subject
to
federal
inspection.
and
the
case
came
up
here
and
justice
hughes
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
he
sets
out
very
clearly
the
three
governing
rules
that
apply
and
i
think
applied
right
here.
first,
he
says
is
there
a
conflict
with
federal
law?
he
says
if
there’s
a
conflict
with
federal
law,
the
federal
law
prevailed
because
it
is
paramount
and
the
state
law
fails.
secondly
he
says,
if
the
subject
is
one
demanding
uniformity
whether
a
conflict
or
not
that
the
state
action
will
not
be
permissible.
well,
we
submit
here
we
have
a
proposition
that
does
require
uniformity
of
dealing.
then
he
said
that
there
was
room
for
a
state
to
deal
with
purely
local
exigencies
when
there
was
neither
conflict
nor
a
necessity
for
uniformity
and
some
very
limited
action
was
allowed
the
state
to
act
in
this
area
pending
action
by
the
federal
government.
now,
those
are
the
--
that’s
a
modern
rule
for
protecting
the
maritime,
a
jurisdiction
and
administration
of
this
nation
and
it
does
belong
to
this
country
and
if
doesn’t
belong
to
the
several
states
because
that
has
a
countrywide
responsibility
and
a
nationwide
responsibility
and
i
submit
that
on
all
three
of
those
considerations
that
this
act
fails.
they
argued
that
hereon
which
cited
the
kelly
against
washington
case.
the
case
of
michigan
over
there
was
a
municipal
coordinate
dealing
with
smoke
intensity
and
the
court
allowed
that
to
stand.
they
claimed
that
that
where
there’s
a
--
was
a
departure
from
kelly
against
washington.
it
was
really
an
effort
by
the
court
to
adjust
to
that
little
local
room
there,
a
local
exigency,
the
particular
situation
which
provided
the
misdemeanor
for
a
ship
to
be
emitting
smoke
in
the
city
limits
of
detroit.
mr.
leroy
collins
no
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
leroy
collins
yes,
it
was
claimed
that
federal
inspections
were
required
of
this
and
this
particular
type
of
(inaudible)
met
with
federal
inspections
and
there
was
a
strong
dissent
in
that
case
that
my
personal
feeling
would
follow
actually,
that
was
by
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
douglas.
but
even
so
that’s
just
a
tiny,
tiny
island
there
that
that
cannot
be
possibly
be
a
base
of
foreign
act
that
this
is
as
far
reaching
this
as
this
went
years.
so
we
say
it
is
up
to
the
congress
to
say
what
the
(inaudible)
is
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
congress
had
not
been
lax
in
its
interest
in
this
matter.
it
is
move
very
importantly
over
the
last
25
years
that
to
meet
needs
that
arising
in
this
matter
of
greater
and
greater
demand
for
more
and
more
shipping
of
oil
to
meet
the
greater
and
greater
demand
for
electric
power
this
country
and
that
same
thing
is
true
all
over
the
world.
this
is
a
serious
problem
but
it’s
not
one
that
the
congress
is
not
aware
of.
it’s
not
one
that
the
congress
didn’t
moving
very
specifically
and
very
importantly
to
meet.
in
our
case,
there
is
conflict,
the
united
states
is
exercising
its
paramount
power
and
the
state
is
seeking
in
to
supersede
this.
in
our
case,
there
is
a
necessity
for
uniformity.
they
argue
about.
they
can’t
possibly
say
that
this
matter
of
controlling
this
kind
of
navigational
operation
and
experienced
is
a
local
matter.
but
we
could
have
an
oil
spill
at
pensacola
that
might
not
hurt
pensacola
totally
and
might
wind
up
in
mobile
and
it
creates
a
problem
in
that
state.
now
supposed
to
use
a
hypothetical
case
we
had
a
spill
up
near
new
york
and
it
got
to
go
stream
and
started
drifting
up
the
new
england
coast
there.
well,
if
they
applied
the
law
that
the
attorney
general
is
seeking
to
uphold
here
then
you
will
have
a
new
york
state.
a
team
out
there
trying
to
deal
with
this
matter
and
telling
the
master
of
the
ship
what
to
do
with
the
ship
and
how
to
handle
it
and
trying
to
manage
a
team
and
then
when
did
this
spill
across
the
stateline
and
you
got
into
connecticut
while
here’s
another
state
out
there
with
another
team
and
whole
regulations
and
more
controlled
and
different
ones
and
so
it
goes
the
main
you’ve
have
the
same
sort
of
thing.
this
is
definitely
an
area
which
we
require
uniformity
and
requires
the
kind
of
action
that
the
federal
government
is
applied
at
the
present
time.
in
the
national
conventions
of
a
dealing
with
this
subject
and
importantly
and
of
course
this
would
supersede
any
state
regulation.
the
ship
as
i
represent
do
not
seek
to
avoid
regulation
concerning
oil
spills.
on
the
contrary,
they
had
worked
with
congress
and
continued
to
do
so
in
relation
to
oils
spill
legislation.
however,
this
ship
was
worked
daily
in
the
complexities
of
the
federal
admiralty
scheme
and
they
realized
as
a
practical
matter
and
impossible
situation
would
exist
if
states
were
free
to
legislate
within
the
area
of
oil
spill
control
as
florida
seeks
to
do.
there
is
a
better
way
now.
there
is
a
better
way
then
for
each
state
to
try
to
outdo
the
federal
government.
we’re
all
in
this
together,
the
state
act
should
be
found
invalid
here
at
the
district
court
has.
and
the
interested
state
should
then
find
ways
to
exhibit
their
effectiveness
in
the
formulation
support
and
execution
of
federal
policy
in
this
field
and
there
is
no
lack
of
federal
power,
there
is
no
disposition
by
our
federal
leadership
not
to
move,
there’s
no
lack
of
awareness
of
the
states
involved
for
florida
and
all
the
sister
states
as
well.
so
we
submit
the
case,
the
decision
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
