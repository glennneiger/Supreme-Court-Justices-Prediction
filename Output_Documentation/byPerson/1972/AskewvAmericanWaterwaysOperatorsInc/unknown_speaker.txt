unknown
speaker
while
you
are
interrupted,
could
i
ask
you
if
you
read
the
district
court’s
opinion
as
looking
at
the
federal
water
pollution
act
as
being
an
exercise
of
congressional
jurisdiction
in
the
admiralty
area?
unknown
speaker
what
authority
does
the
federal
government
have
to
adopt
the
water
pollution
act?
unknown
speaker
what
congressional
--
what
constitutional
authority
was
congress
exercising?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don’t
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
--
with
admiralty
jurisdiction
or
admiralty
power?
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
well
doesn’t
if
the
question
is
a
conflict
with
the
federal
act
is
it
with
the
constitutional
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
however
the
water
pollution
under
--
whatever
authority
the
water
pollution
act
was
adopted.
if
the
question
is
one
of
conflict
with
a
valid
federal
act
then
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
of
what
the
source
of
the
congressional
authority
was?
unknown
speaker
if
the
district
court
then
did
ascertain
some
conflict
between
the
water
pollution
act
and
the
federal
--
and
florida
law,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
is
it
really
important
in
this
case
to
talk
about
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
if
we’re
really
talking
about
the
question
of
pre-emption
under
the
water
pollution
control
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general
you
--
just
incidentally
as
you
say
as
you
put
it
is
there
a
conflict
between
the
florida
law
and
the
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
limitation
of
liability
in
the
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
it’s
limited
liability?
unknown
speaker
but
there
isn’t
any
limitation
on
the
florida?
unknown
speaker
attorney
general
in
your
point,
i
think
you
stated
in
your
brief
that
the
district
court’s
refusal
to
several
portions
of
the
state
statute
will
not
be
disputed
on
appeal.
does
this
mean
it
is
your
position
because
i
think
you’ve
just
intimated
that
the
act
is
valid
in
its
entirety
and
that
you
want
the
whole
thing
or
--and
would
not
be
contend
with
any
portions
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
the
court
should
hold
that
the
florida
act
in
so
far
as
it
affects
criminal
facilities
for
instance
is
valid
and
the
rest
of
it
is
not.
would
you
take
at
least
that
much
if
you
could
have
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
up
to
this
day
if
a
vessel
sitting
and
appear
are
navigable
waters
causes
a
fire
ashore
and
the
hotel
burns
down?
now,
what’s
the
governing
law
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
i’m
talking
about
the
cause
of
fire
that
originates
on
the
ship
causing
a
shoreside
injury
now
about
the
admiralty
extension
act?
unknown
speaker
then
there
must
be
a
law
in
that
area.
do
you
mean
your
answer
depends
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
admiralty
extension
act?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
the
admiralty
extension
act
is
constitutional,
what
about
the
hotel
owner
then?
unknown
speaker
so
that
this
thing
you’re
talking
about
the
people
injured
to
shore
by
an
oil
slick,
those
people
are
like
the
hotel
owner?
unknown
speaker
multiplied
many
times.
unknown
speaker
but
again,
assuming
the
constitutionality
of
the
admiralty
extension
act,
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well
you
must
then
be
arguing
also
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
has
been
somehow
modified
by
the
water
pollution.
unknown
speaker
and
that
congress
has
power
to
cede
to
that
the
state
in
effect
that
certain
jurisdiction
in
this
area
in
this
zone.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
we
overrule
jensen
or
that
we
--
unknown
speaker
i
have
said
earlier
it’s
limited
them
largely
to
conflicts
on
personal
entry
case?
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
the
way
you
want
to
leave
it?
unknown
speaker
does
jensen
have
to
do
with
the
sewage
cited
against
(inaudible)
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn’t
it
have
anything
to
do
with
shoreside
damage?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
need
to
modify
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
as
a
general
principle
that
anywhere
there’s
admiralty
it’s
exclusive?
unknown
speaker
did
congress
purport
to
say
what
authority
was
being
exercised
with
the
water
pollution
act?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
consequence
if
it
was
the
admiralty
power,
mr.
healy?
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
issues
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
this
go
so
far
--
as
essential
suggest
that
if
its
admiralty
then
there’s
absolutely
no
power
of
any
kind
in
the
states?
unknown
speaker
and
whether
it’s
personally
to
use
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
that’s
none
of
the
statement,
i
suppose
is
it?
unknown
speaker
does
harbor
workers’
--
does
a
harbor
workers’
act
preempt
state
compensation
act?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
everyone
whose
covered
by?
unknown
speaker
jensen,
wouldn’t
have
kept
the
state
from
giving
a
workmen’s
compensation
remedy
to
people
who
are
injured
on
shore?
unknown
speaker
but
the
harbor
workers’
act
provides
the
remedy
for
them
if
they’re
in
maritime
pursuits,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
just
in
--
just
on
ship?
unknown
speaker
could
it
have
that
done
so?
congress?
could
have
coverage
shoreside
harbor
worker
injuries?
unknown
speaker
but
it
wouldn’t
necessary
have
to
been
exclusive?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
say
that,
don’t
you,
on
your
brief
please.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
there’s
no
independent
congressional
intent
or
is
it
just
a
question
of
fact
that
the
judiciary
addresses
itself
to
as
where
there’s
been
preemption.
meaning
your
water
quality
improvement,
you
had
this
expressed
negation
of
preemption.
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
that
it
said
is
some
areas
but
defining
them,
this
act
does
preclude
concurrent
exercise
of
power
by
the
states.
would
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you
have
to
say
that
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
the
knickerbocker
ice
and
the
rest
have
a
personal
entry
cases.
unknown
speaker
well
i
suppose
you
would
still
be
here
even
if
there
were
no
federal
water
improvement
legislation
at
all
would
you?
unknown
speaker
just
for
the
claim
that
florida
was
without
power
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
admiralty?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
the
basic
decision
of
the
district
court,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
the
government
doesn’t
quite
--
doesn’t
--
wouldn’t
provide
in
a
loss
of
profits
--
unknown
speaker
--
which
might
be
recovered
in
the
private
suit?
unknown
speaker
now
an
absent
of
the
water
pollution
control
act
and
absent
the
admiralty
extension
act,
you
wouldn’t
be
here
would
you?
unknown
speaker
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
prior
to
the
admiralty
extension
act?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you.
i
should
have
limited
the
question
to
shoreside
damage.
unknown
speaker
absent
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
unknown
speaker
yes,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
as
i
remember
governor,
there
was
no
federal
statute
on
that
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
federally
license
to
the
vessels
[voice
overlap]
that
if
somehow
was
an
impairment
of
the
federal
license
to
court.
