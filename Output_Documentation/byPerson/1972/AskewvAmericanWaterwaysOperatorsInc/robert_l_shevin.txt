mr.
robert
l.
shevin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
you
honors,
just
as
maritime
law
was
developed
to
meet
the
crisis
of
developing
industry
with
peculiar
problems,
so
environmental
needs
of
today
we
believed
demand
their
own
jurisprudence.
the
federal
act,
the
water
quality
improvement
act
is
reflective
of
this
need
to
develop
new
concepts
of
legal
responsibilities
in
crimes
against
the
environment.
the
federal
act
sets
the
pattern.
the
florida
act
we
contend
is
a
legitimate
response
to
the
federal
act
to
the
awakening
of
a
growing
necessity
by
congress
and
if
conflicts
the
necessity
to
deal
with
massive
oil
spills
which
is
not
here
before
it
had
been
dealt
with
and
if
it
conflicts
with
the
tenants
of
maritime
law
or
any
other
body
of
law
then
we
contend
that
the
conflict
is
purely
incidental
and
unfortunate.
there’s
certainly
is
no
a
reconcilable
conflict
between
the
federal
and
florida
acts.
the
two
acts
speak
to
federals
state
relationship,
cooperation
and
meeting
the
threats
of
massive
oil
spills.
the
act
speaks
of
joint
cooperation
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
to
meet
serious
economic
and
environmental
problem.
the
national
contingency
plan
that’s
outlined
in
the
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970
speaks
to
a
coordination
of
effort
with
matters
such
as
containment,
dispersal
and
removal
of
oil
with
state
and
local
agencies.
in
the
federal
act,
when
it
speaks
of
a
marine
disaster,
it
talks
of
coordinating
all
public
and
private
interest
so
the
two
acts
they
interrelate
rather
than
conflict
and
the
implication
in
both
statutes
is
not
competition
but
cooperation.
and
as
mr.
dearing
point
out
the
florida
act
itself
says
that
the
intent
of
this
act
to
support
and
complement
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
now
many
environmental
problems
at
the
state
of
local
level
exist,
your
honors
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
oh!
no,
your
honor,
we
contend
there
is
no
conflict.
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
florida
law
of
1970
and
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
there
is
in
effect
in
the
federal
act,
your
honor,
an
absolute
liability
but
it’s
somewhat
qualified
with
certain
defenses
that
can
be
read.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
to
a
certain
extent
not
the
same
that
was
the
1851
limitation.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
there
is
no
limitation
and
to
this,
your
honor,
we
contend
that
the
federal
government
and
the
anti-preemption
clause
specifically
granted
to
the
state
the
right
to
pass
any
requirement
of
liability
and
those
are
the
words
any
requirement
or
liability
or
the
terms,
the
words
that
are
used
in
the
anti-preemption
clause
so
we
contend
that
the
florida
act
is
simply
an
extension.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
limitation,
the
federal
act
does
allow
certain
defenses,
the
florida
act
also
allows
certain
similar
defenses
of
acts
of
god,
and
third
parties
that
would
be
responsible
for
the
negligence
and
so
forth
are
provided
within
the
florida
act
as
well
that
they
can
be
raised.
your
honors,
many
of
these
problems
exists
in
the
first
instance
because
of
pressures
to
continue
traditional
tenants
of
established
jurisprudence.
time
manner
concepts
and
property
law
obstruct
the
state
many
times
in
an
effort
to
protect
the
rights
of
beaches
of
inland
waterways
of
natural
resources
and
compound
problems
with
sewage
treatment,
water
purity
and
other
problems
severe
water
pollution.
so
we
contend
that
the
federal
act,
the
water
quality
improvement
act
is
a
step
forward.
it’s
a
threshold
upon
which
the
state
local
governments
can
build
together
with
the
federal
government
a
new
system
of
laws
and
environmental
jurisprudence
to
meet
the
crucial
demands
brought
by
the
industrial
system
itself.
we
contend
that
this
is
federalism
in
the
truest
sense.
if
the
law
were
to
seek
to
limit
or
to
extend
damages
to
the
federal
agency
involved
which
is
what
the
federal
act
speaks
to,
then
and
only
then
where
there
be
a
conflict.
there
is
no
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
two
acts
that
are
being
reviewed
here.
if
the
federal
act
were
to
address
itself
to
state
recoveries
which
it
does
not
then
such
conflict
might
be
found.
on
the
contrary,
the
federal
act
invites
the
state
to
impose
any
requirement
or
liability
with
respect
to
the
discharged
of
oil
into
the
waters
of
the
state
and
florida
has
done
this.
the
danger
of
a
massive
oil
spill
by
pollution
is
both
a
federal
and
a
state
problem
that
district
court
by
its
decision
we
contend
has
frustrated
this
expression
of
federalism
and
if
federalism
is
to
be
more
than
an
academic
theory
then
it
requires
an
expression
in
the
instant
case
by
reversal
of
the
lower
court
and
a
declaration
of
the
florida
law
is
valid
in
all
respects.
this
is
a
matter
of
particular
concerned
to
florida.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
your
honor,
we
take
the
position
that
the
act
is
valid
in
its
entirety.
quite
obviously,
it
contains
the
severability
clause,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
amicus
brief
which
supports
the
position
of
the
state
in
many
respects
disagrees
with
the
position
of
the
state
in
one
or
two
other
respects
here
just
the
court
to
strike
certain
portions
and
allow
others
to
remain
and
of
course
the
court
has
this
option.
but
its
our
contention
and
we
take
the
position
in
this
appeal
that
the
entire
act
spell
it
and
that
within
the
traditional
police
powers
of
the
state,
the
state
has
a
compelling
and
urgent
and
reasonable
need
to
legislate
in
this
field
to
complement
with
federal
legislation
that
release
is
not
obtainable
in
the
admiralty
courts
when
the
limitation
of
liability
is
based
upon
the
value
of
the
vessel
after
the
fact
because
if
the
vessel
sinks
we’re
talking
about
the
limitation
being
based
upon
the
salvage
value
of
the
vessel
that
this
will
not
give
us
the
type
of
remedy
that’s
necessary
to
cleanup
massive
oil
spills
and
to
give
a
relief
to
third
party
as
to
citizens
of
florida
who
have
a
justifiable
cause
and
cannot
obtained
any
justice
in
the
courts
if
they
are
limited
to
going
in
through
an
admiralty
proceeding.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
your
honor
quite
obviously,
i’ll
be
less
than
candid
if
i
said
that
we
would
not
want
to
see
certain
portions
at
least
certain
portions
of
the
act
upheld
but
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
entire
should
be
upheld.
your
honor,
on
this
point
of
the
relief
and
the
remedy,
i
would
challenge
the
appellees
to
show
us
how
a
third
person,
a
citizen,
a
hotel
owner
whose
surrounding
beaches
that
are
available
to
the
public
and
to
his
hotel
guests
if
those
beaches
are
ruined
how
he’s
going
to
receive
relief
in
the
admiralty
courts
and
how
the
state
of
florida
is
going
to
cleanup
a
massive
spill
in
the
admiralty
courts.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
think
the
governing
law
in
that
situation
it
would
again
depend
if
we’re
talking
about
a
sea
to
shore
tort.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
your
honor,
i
believe
in
that
case
that
the
hotel
owner
would
have
his
third
party
rights
common
law
rights
and
would
not
be
limited
to
the
relief
that
the
congress
purports
to
give
under
the
admiralty
extension
because
i
don’t
believe
that
the
congress
could
properly
extend.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
my
answer
to
that
question
would
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
i
think
in
that
case
that
he
would
be
limited
by
to
go
into
the
court
of
admiralty.
he
would
be
limited
in
his
remedies
to
that
extent.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
there’s
the
hotel
owner
people
who
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
many
times
citizens,
the
state
in
its
cleanup
processes.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
your
honor
assuming
the
constitutionality
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
it
creates
a
very
serious
problem
except
for
the
fact
that
the
congress
and
the
water
quality
improvement
act,
we
think
founded
that
on
the
commerce
clause
specifically
recognizes
other
responsibilities,
other
concepts
of
liability
rather
than
the
old
1851
standards
and
specifically,
your
honor
if
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
was
considered
by
the
congress
to
be
in
the
admiralty
area
dealing
with
oil
spills
then
why
would
they
have
provided
the
act
that
the
remedies
are
in
the
federal
district
court?
that
would
have
been
totally
unnecessary.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
we
are
arguing
that
the
congress
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
we’re
arguing
that
the
congress
recognized
an
emerging
new
concept
that
jurisprudence
that
they
legislated
accordingly,
that
they
clearly
gave
the
states
the
responsibility
and
invited
the
states
to
pass
similar
legislation
and
to
go
further
and
this
is
what
the
state
of
florida
has
done
and
if
the
water
quality
improvement
act
is
to
have
any
meaning
in
the
field
of
jurisprudence
to
be
able
to
react
to
and
prevent
a
massive
oil
spill,
then
the
state
ought
to
be
able
to
legislate
in
this
field
as
well.
now,
you
honors,
the
federal
act
does
nothing
more
than
set
minimum
standards.
i
gives
the
states
the
rights
to
adopt
more
stringent
requirements,
this
is
what
the
state
has
done
just
like
in
the
clean
air
act,
just
like
in
the
water
pollution
act
in
and
of
the
air
and
water
pollution
acts
the
state
had
been
given
the
right
to
move
further
just
like
the
present
cooperation
between
the
federal
government
and
florida
to
save
florida’s
coastal
lands
and
tidal
waters.
the
florida
act
is
no
more
violative
of
the
water
quality
improvement
act
than
our
water
quality
standards
develop
by
the
states
violative
of
another
section
of
the
law
33
u.s.c.
1171
subsection
(b)
of
which
requires
a
party
seeking
a
federal
discharge
permit
to
obtain
certification
from
the
state
water
pollution
agency
that
the
anticipated
discharged
will
not
violate
state
water
quality
standards.
and
if
the
non-preemption
clause
of
the
water
quality
improvement
act
is
to
have
any
meaning
as
a
congress
intended,
surely
it
should
permit
the
state
as
florida
has
done
to
allow
private
claimants
in
the
state
itself
to
recover
under
strict
liability
principles
rather
than
the
fault
concept
of
maritime
law
and
they
speak
of
uniformity.
certainly,
uniformity
would
be
something
that
the
maritime
attorneys
would
desire
and
perhaps
the
insurers
would
desire
uniformity
but
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
agrees
and
concedes
that
although
the
application
of
florida
standard
of
liability
absolute
might
create
a
lack
of
uniformity
that
this
is
not
a
subject
requiring
uniform
federal
regulation,
that
there
has
been
no
preemption
and
even
if
negligence
is
considered
to
be
the
standard,
there
is
no
policy
of
maritime
law
opposed
to
liability
without
call
for
damages
caused
by
oil
spill
from
ships
that
florida
has
a
legitimate
right
and
interest
to
legislate
and
to
apply
the
standards
of
liability
and
view
of
the
potential
impact
of
oil
spills
on
florida’s
environment
and
economy
and
that
the
solicitor
general
in
other
words
contends
that
this
is
an
area
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
now,
the
lower
court
apparently
felt
that
each
course
was
dictated
by
a
series
of
earlier
cases
jensen,
knickerbocker,
dawson
and
these
cases
have
been
mentioned
by
mr.
dearing.
however,
these
cases
are
more
than
48
years
old.
there
are
dubious
logic
this
court
has
severely
limited
their
application
and
it
is
hope
that
this
precepts
will
not
be
perpetuated
simply
by
the
inertia
of
the
rule
of
president
because
if
this
court
affirms
the
district
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well
jensen,
i
am
suggesting
that
jensen
has
already
been
severely
limited
and
as
a
result
of
the
limitation.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
on
workman’s
compensation.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
we
contend
that
that’s
the
way
that
you
are
to
believe
it.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
it
is.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
that’s
correct,
it
has
absolutely
nothing
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
i’m
contending
your
honor,
that
the
lower
court
based
its
decision
basically
are
jensen,
knickerbocker,
and
dawson
which
we
think
is
inapplicable.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
that’s
correct,
that’s
was
the
basis
of
the
lower
court’s
decision.
your
honors,
we
contend
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
district
court
that
will
be
tantamount
to
affirming
200
years
of
law
but
no
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
governor
collins
if
that
spill
that
you
referred
to
ends
up
in
mobile
then
i
would
hope
that
the
state
of
alabama
has
a
law
similar
to
florida’s
because
then
they
could
take
care
of
that
spill.
if
it
ends
up
in
pensacola
then
i
want
to
be
certain
that
the
state
of
florida
can
cleanup
that
spill
and
at
the
people
who
are
damaged
by
that
spill
have
a
right
of
recovery
in
a
court
of
law
and
are
not
limited
by
high
bound
traditions
which
do
not
speak
to
the
question
of
massive
oil
spills.
by
the
use
of
the
words,
any
requirement
or
liability
in
the
water
quality
improvement
act,
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
fully
intended
to
give
broad
latitude
to
the
states
to
enact
whatever
requirements
of
liabilities
and
standards
of
the
states
deemed
warranted
in
the
exercise
of
their
legislative
powers
to
prevent
and
control
and
provide
relief
from
oil
pollution.
congress
was
not
only
acquiescing
in
the
enactment
of
state
legislature
they
were
actually
inviting
the
states
to
act
to
pass
its
legislation
and
pursuant
to
this
invitation
florida
passed
its
law
and
this
law
was
based
on
direct
and
compelling
interest
that
the
state
has
urgent
interest
for
the
protection
of
its
economy
and
its
environment.
it’s
the
proper
exercise
of
the
police
power
the
state
to
protect
our
citizens
and
a
such
should
be
given
the
full
weight
despite
the
lack
of
uniformity
which
the
act
--
which
might
result
because
of
the
act.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
federal
admiralty
extension
act
we
contend
was
improperly
extended
by
the
congress
beyond
the
constitutional
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty
court.
however,
even
if
the
extension
act
were
to
apply
and
is
upheld
by
this
court
and
even
if
the
water
quality
improvement
act
was
bottomed
on
admiralty
rather
than
commerce
there’s
still
would
be
room
for
state
action.
this
is
not
in
exclusive
domain,
there
is
still
room
for
state
action,
there’s
still
concurrent
authority
and
the
solicitor
general
in
his
amicus
briefs
says
uniformity
and
we
agree
must
yield
to
the
overriding
need
for
the
state
to
legislate
for
the
interests
of
its
citizens.
florida
has
legislative
within
the
traditional
bounds
of
the
state’s
police
power
and
to
protect
our
citizens
and
to
protect
our
environment.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
your
honor,
i
think
not
because
the
jensen,
knickerbocker,
and
dawson
cases
have
all
been
very
severely
limited
and
this
court
has
never
dealt
with
this
emerging
law
particularly
with
regard
to
massive
oil
spills
and
uniformity
has
yielded
in
the
past
where
there’s
been
an
overriding
state
interest
to
protect
and
i
don’t
think
it
requires
the
overriding
of
the
long
line
of
cases.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well
i
think
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
you
are
now
speaking
to
the
argument
that
was
raised
as
far
as
containment
gear
and
inspection
of
the
vessel
or
what
type
the
gear
it
has
on.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
let
me
speak
to
that
because
i
think
that
would
be
the
test.
there
had
been
no
florida
regulations
promulgated
as
to
what
type
of
containment
gear
this
vessel
must
have
to
be
able
to
prevent
the
spill
and
take
it
up
as
soon
as
it
occurs.
the
coast
guard
has
not
yet
promulgated
regulations
and
to
rule
our
act
or
that
section
invalid
this
court
must
presume
that
florida’s
regulations
will
conflict
with
the
federal
coast
guard
regulations
and
we
don’t
think
that
this
court
should
presume
that
or
speculate
with
regard
to
what
the
regulations
will
be.
we
think
it’s
entirely
consistent
with
the
florida
act
which
says
this
act
was
designed
to
complement
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
that
certainly
as
to
questions
of
containment
gear
and
this
type
of
regulations
that
those
regulations
would
be
promulgated
to
be
consistent
with
the
regulations
of
the
federal
government.
if
i
may
just
end,
your
honor,
i
think
my
time
is
just
about
out.
we
asked
them
--
we
challenged
them
to
show
us
how
florida
and
its
citizens
would
be
able
to
receive
damages
for
cleanup.
and
they
said,
well
the
federal
government
is
coming
and
cleanup
the
beach
but
we
don’t
want
to
have
to
rely
upon
that.
we
are
not
certain
that’s
going
to
occur,
that’s
not
part
of
this
record
if
the
torrey
canyon
went
down
16
miles
off
from
florida
rather
than
16
miles
off
of
london
there
wouldn’t
have
been
no
recovery.
we
have
been
limited
to
$50.00
salvage
value
and
that’s
why
the
water
quality
improvement
act
gives
broad
powers
and
directs
the
state
to
act
and
why
is
they’re
presently
pending
before
the
senate
of
the
united
states
a
treaty
which
would
be
near
to
unlimited
liability,
$15
million
and
a
contingency
fund
and
absolute
or
strict
liability,
why
is
that
treaty
pending
if
existing
federal
law
is
enough
to
provide
cleanup
cost
and
damages?
obviously,
existing
federal
law
is
not
enough.
the
water
quality
improvement
act
seeks
to
speak
in
this
field,
directs
the
state
act.
the
state
has
acted
constitutionally.
we
ask
you
to
uphold
this
law.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
you
honors,
just
as
maritime
law
was
developed
to
meet
the
crisis
of
developing
industry
with
peculiar
problems,
so
environmental
needs
of
today
we
believed
demand
their
own
jurisprudence.
the
federal
act,
the
water
quality
improvement
act
is
reflective
of
this
need
to
develop
new
concepts
of
legal
responsibilities
in
crimes
against
the
environment.
the
federal
act
sets
the
pattern.
the
florida
act
we
contend
is
a
legitimate
response
to
the
federal
act
to
the
awakening
of
a
growing
necessity
by
congress
and
if
conflicts
the
necessity
to
deal
with
massive
oil
spills
which
is
not
here
before
it
had
been
dealt
with
and
if
it
conflicts
with
the
tenants
of
maritime
law
or
any
other
body
of
law
then
we
contend
that
the
conflict
is
purely
incidental
and
unfortunate.
there’s
certainly
is
no
a
reconcilable
conflict
between
the
federal
and
florida
acts.
the
two
acts
speak
to
federals
state
relationship,
cooperation
and
meeting
the
threats
of
massive
oil
spills.
the
act
speaks
of
joint
cooperation
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
to
meet
serious
economic
and
environmental
problem.
the
national
contingency
plan
that’s
outlined
in
the
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970
speaks
to
a
coordination
of
effort
with
matters
such
as
containment,
dispersal
and
removal
of
oil
with
state
and
local
agencies.
in
the
federal
act,
when
it
speaks
of
a
marine
disaster,
it
talks
of
coordinating
all
public
and
private
interest
so
the
two
acts
they
interrelate
rather
than
conflict
and
the
implication
in
both
statutes
is
not
competition
but
cooperation.
and
as
mr.
dearing
point
out
the
florida
act
itself
says
that
the
intent
of
this
act
to
support
and
complement
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
now
many
environmental
problems
at
the
state
of
local
level
exist,
your
honors
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
oh!
no,
your
honor,
we
contend
there
is
no
conflict.
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
florida
law
of
1970
and
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
there
is
in
effect
in
the
federal
act,
your
honor,
an
absolute
liability
but
it’s
somewhat
qualified
with
certain
defenses
that
can
be
read.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
to
a
certain
extent
not
the
same
that
was
the
1851
limitation.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
there
is
no
limitation
and
to
this,
your
honor,
we
contend
that
the
federal
government
and
the
anti-preemption
clause
specifically
granted
to
the
state
the
right
to
pass
any
requirement
of
liability
and
those
are
the
words
any
requirement
or
liability
or
the
terms,
the
words
that
are
used
in
the
anti-preemption
clause
so
we
contend
that
the
florida
act
is
simply
an
extension.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
limitation,
the
federal
act
does
allow
certain
defenses,
the
florida
act
also
allows
certain
similar
defenses
of
acts
of
god,
and
third
parties
that
would
be
responsible
for
the
negligence
and
so
forth
are
provided
within
the
florida
act
as
well
that
they
can
be
raised.
your
honors,
many
of
these
problems
exists
in
the
first
instance
because
of
pressures
to
continue
traditional
tenants
of
established
jurisprudence.
time
manner
concepts
and
property
law
obstruct
the
state
many
times
in
an
effort
to
protect
the
rights
of
beaches
of
inland
waterways
of
natural
resources
and
compound
problems
with
sewage
treatment,
water
purity
and
other
problems
severe
water
pollution.
so
we
contend
that
the
federal
act,
the
water
quality
improvement
act
is
a
step
forward.
it’s
a
threshold
upon
which
the
state
local
governments
can
build
together
with
the
federal
government
a
new
system
of
laws
and
environmental
jurisprudence
to
meet
the
crucial
demands
brought
by
the
industrial
system
itself.
we
contend
that
this
is
federalism
in
the
truest
sense.
if
the
law
were
to
seek
to
limit
or
to
extend
damages
to
the
federal
agency
involved
which
is
what
the
federal
act
speaks
to,
then
and
only
then
where
there
be
a
conflict.
there
is
no
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
two
acts
that
are
being
reviewed
here.
if
the
federal
act
were
to
address
itself
to
state
recoveries
which
it
does
not
then
such
conflict
might
be
found.
on
the
contrary,
the
federal
act
invites
the
state
to
impose
any
requirement
or
liability
with
respect
to
the
discharged
of
oil
into
the
waters
of
the
state
and
florida
has
done
this.
the
danger
of
a
massive
oil
spill
by
pollution
is
both
a
federal
and
a
state
problem
that
district
court
by
its
decision
we
contend
has
frustrated
this
expression
of
federalism
and
if
federalism
is
to
be
more
than
an
academic
theory
then
it
requires
an
expression
in
the
instant
case
by
reversal
of
the
lower
court
and
a
declaration
of
the
florida
law
is
valid
in
all
respects.
this
is
a
matter
of
particular
concerned
to
florida.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
your
honor,
we
take
the
position
that
the
act
is
valid
in
its
entirety.
quite
obviously,
it
contains
the
severability
clause,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
amicus
brief
which
supports
the
position
of
the
state
in
many
respects
disagrees
with
the
position
of
the
state
in
one
or
two
other
respects
here
just
the
court
to
strike
certain
portions
and
allow
others
to
remain
and
of
course
the
court
has
this
option.
but
its
our
contention
and
we
take
the
position
in
this
appeal
that
the
entire
act
spell
it
and
that
within
the
traditional
police
powers
of
the
state,
the
state
has
a
compelling
and
urgent
and
reasonable
need
to
legislate
in
this
field
to
complement
with
federal
legislation
that
release
is
not
obtainable
in
the
admiralty
courts
when
the
limitation
of
liability
is
based
upon
the
value
of
the
vessel
after
the
fact
because
if
the
vessel
sinks
we’re
talking
about
the
limitation
being
based
upon
the
salvage
value
of
the
vessel
that
this
will
not
give
us
the
type
of
remedy
that’s
necessary
to
cleanup
massive
oil
spills
and
to
give
a
relief
to
third
party
as
to
citizens
of
florida
who
have
a
justifiable
cause
and
cannot
obtained
any
justice
in
the
courts
if
they
are
limited
to
going
in
through
an
admiralty
proceeding.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
your
honor
quite
obviously,
i’ll
be
less
than
candid
if
i
said
that
we
would
not
want
to
see
certain
portions
at
least
certain
portions
of
the
act
upheld
but
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
entire
should
be
upheld.
your
honor,
on
this
point
of
the
relief
and
the
remedy,
i
would
challenge
the
appellees
to
show
us
how
a
third
person,
a
citizen,
a
hotel
owner
whose
surrounding
beaches
that
are
available
to
the
public
and
to
his
hotel
guests
if
those
beaches
are
ruined
how
he’s
going
to
receive
relief
in
the
admiralty
courts
and
how
the
state
of
florida
is
going
to
cleanup
a
massive
spill
in
the
admiralty
courts.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
think
the
governing
law
in
that
situation
it
would
again
depend
if
we’re
talking
about
a
sea
to
shore
tort.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
your
honor,
i
believe
in
that
case
that
the
hotel
owner
would
have
his
third
party
rights
common
law
rights
and
would
not
be
limited
to
the
relief
that
the
congress
purports
to
give
under
the
admiralty
extension
because
i
don’t
believe
that
the
congress
could
properly
extend.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
my
answer
to
that
question
would
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
i
think
in
that
case
that
he
would
be
limited
by
to
go
into
the
court
of
admiralty.
he
would
be
limited
in
his
remedies
to
that
extent.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
there’s
the
hotel
owner
people
who
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
many
times
citizens,
the
state
in
its
cleanup
processes.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
your
honor
assuming
the
constitutionality
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
it
creates
a
very
serious
problem
except
for
the
fact
that
the
congress
and
the
water
quality
improvement
act,
we
think
founded
that
on
the
commerce
clause
specifically
recognizes
other
responsibilities,
other
concepts
of
liability
rather
than
the
old
1851
standards
and
specifically,
your
honor
if
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
was
considered
by
the
congress
to
be
in
the
admiralty
area
dealing
with
oil
spills
then
why
would
they
have
provided
the
act
that
the
remedies
are
in
the
federal
district
court?
that
would
have
been
totally
unnecessary.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
we
are
arguing
that
the
congress
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
we’re
arguing
that
the
congress
recognized
an
emerging
new
concept
that
jurisprudence
that
they
legislated
accordingly,
that
they
clearly
gave
the
states
the
responsibility
and
invited
the
states
to
pass
similar
legislation
and
to
go
further
and
this
is
what
the
state
of
florida
has
done
and
if
the
water
quality
improvement
act
is
to
have
any
meaning
in
the
field
of
jurisprudence
to
be
able
to
react
to
and
prevent
a
massive
oil
spill,
then
the
state
ought
to
be
able
to
legislate
in
this
field
as
well.
now,
you
honors,
the
federal
act
does
nothing
more
than
set
minimum
standards.
i
gives
the
states
the
rights
to
adopt
more
stringent
requirements,
this
is
what
the
state
has
done
just
like
in
the
clean
air
act,
just
like
in
the
water
pollution
act
in
and
of
the
air
and
water
pollution
acts
the
state
had
been
given
the
right
to
move
further
just
like
the
present
cooperation
between
the
federal
government
and
florida
to
save
florida’s
coastal
lands
and
tidal
waters.
the
florida
act
is
no
more
violative
of
the
water
quality
improvement
act
than
our
water
quality
standards
develop
by
the
states
violative
of
another
section
of
the
law
33
u.s.c.
1171
subsection
(b)
of
which
requires
a
party
seeking
a
federal
discharge
permit
to
obtain
certification
from
the
state
water
pollution
agency
that
the
anticipated
discharged
will
not
violate
state
water
quality
standards.
and
if
the
non-preemption
clause
of
the
water
quality
improvement
act
is
to
have
any
meaning
as
a
congress
intended,
surely
it
should
permit
the
state
as
florida
has
done
to
allow
private
claimants
in
the
state
itself
to
recover
under
strict
liability
principles
rather
than
the
fault
concept
of
maritime
law
and
they
speak
of
uniformity.
certainly,
uniformity
would
be
something
that
the
maritime
attorneys
would
desire
and
perhaps
the
insurers
would
desire
uniformity
but
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
agrees
and
concedes
that
although
the
application
of
florida
standard
of
liability
absolute
might
create
a
lack
of
uniformity
that
this
is
not
a
subject
requiring
uniform
federal
regulation,
that
there
has
been
no
preemption
and
even
if
negligence
is
considered
to
be
the
standard,
there
is
no
policy
of
maritime
law
opposed
to
liability
without
call
for
damages
caused
by
oil
spill
from
ships
that
florida
has
a
legitimate
right
and
interest
to
legislate
and
to
apply
the
standards
of
liability
and
view
of
the
potential
impact
of
oil
spills
on
florida’s
environment
and
economy
and
that
the
solicitor
general
in
other
words
contends
that
this
is
an
area
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
now,
the
lower
court
apparently
felt
that
each
course
was
dictated
by
a
series
of
earlier
cases
jensen,
knickerbocker,
dawson
and
these
cases
have
been
mentioned
by
mr.
dearing.
however,
these
cases
are
more
than
48
years
old.
there
are
dubious
logic
this
court
has
severely
limited
their
application
and
it
is
hope
that
this
precepts
will
not
be
perpetuated
simply
by
the
inertia
of
the
rule
of
president
because
if
this
court
affirms
the
district
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well
jensen,
i
am
suggesting
that
jensen
has
already
been
severely
limited
and
as
a
result
of
the
limitation.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
on
workman’s
compensation.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
we
contend
that
that’s
the
way
that
you
are
to
believe
it.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
it
is.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
that’s
correct,
it
has
absolutely
nothing
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
i’m
contending
your
honor,
that
the
lower
court
based
its
decision
basically
are
jensen,
knickerbocker,
and
dawson
which
we
think
is
inapplicable.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
that’s
correct,
that’s
was
the
basis
of
the
lower
court’s
decision.
your
honors,
we
contend
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
district
court
that
will
be
tantamount
to
affirming
200
years
of
law
but
no
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
governor
collins
if
that
spill
that
you
referred
to
ends
up
in
mobile
then
i
would
hope
that
the
state
of
alabama
has
a
law
similar
to
florida’s
because
then
they
could
take
care
of
that
spill.
if
it
ends
up
in
pensacola
then
i
want
to
be
certain
that
the
state
of
florida
can
cleanup
that
spill
and
at
the
people
who
are
damaged
by
that
spill
have
a
right
of
recovery
in
a
court
of
law
and
are
not
limited
by
high
bound
traditions
which
do
not
speak
to
the
question
of
massive
oil
spills.
by
the
use
of
the
words,
any
requirement
or
liability
in
the
water
quality
improvement
act,
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
fully
intended
to
give
broad
latitude
to
the
states
to
enact
whatever
requirements
of
liabilities
and
standards
of
the
states
deemed
warranted
in
the
exercise
of
their
legislative
powers
to
prevent
and
control
and
provide
relief
from
oil
pollution.
congress
was
not
only
acquiescing
in
the
enactment
of
state
legislature
they
were
actually
inviting
the
states
to
act
to
pass
its
legislation
and
pursuant
to
this
invitation
florida
passed
its
law
and
this
law
was
based
on
direct
and
compelling
interest
that
the
state
has
urgent
interest
for
the
protection
of
its
economy
and
its
environment.
it’s
the
proper
exercise
of
the
police
power
the
state
to
protect
our
citizens
and
a
such
should
be
given
the
full
weight
despite
the
lack
of
uniformity
which
the
act
--
which
might
result
because
of
the
act.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
federal
admiralty
extension
act
we
contend
was
improperly
extended
by
the
congress
beyond
the
constitutional
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty
court.
however,
even
if
the
extension
act
were
to
apply
and
is
upheld
by
this
court
and
even
if
the
water
quality
improvement
act
was
bottomed
on
admiralty
rather
than
commerce
there’s
still
would
be
room
for
state
action.
this
is
not
in
exclusive
domain,
there
is
still
room
for
state
action,
there’s
still
concurrent
authority
and
the
solicitor
general
in
his
amicus
briefs
says
uniformity
and
we
agree
must
yield
to
the
overriding
need
for
the
state
to
legislate
for
the
interests
of
its
citizens.
florida
has
legislative
within
the
traditional
bounds
of
the
state’s
police
power
and
to
protect
our
citizens
and
to
protect
our
environment.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
your
honor,
i
think
not
because
the
jensen,
knickerbocker,
and
dawson
cases
have
all
been
very
severely
limited
and
this
court
has
never
dealt
with
this
emerging
law
particularly
with
regard
to
massive
oil
spills
and
uniformity
has
yielded
in
the
past
where
there’s
been
an
overriding
state
interest
to
protect
and
i
don’t
think
it
requires
the
overriding
of
the
long
line
of
cases.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well
i
think
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
you
are
now
speaking
to
the
argument
that
was
raised
as
far
as
containment
gear
and
inspection
of
the
vessel
or
what
type
the
gear
it
has
on.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
let
me
speak
to
that
because
i
think
that
would
be
the
test.
there
had
been
no
florida
regulations
promulgated
as
to
what
type
of
containment
gear
this
vessel
must
have
to
be
able
to
prevent
the
spill
and
take
it
up
as
soon
as
it
occurs.
the
coast
guard
has
not
yet
promulgated
regulations
and
to
rule
our
act
or
that
section
invalid
this
court
must
presume
that
florida’s
regulations
will
conflict
with
the
federal
coast
guard
regulations
and
we
don’t
think
that
this
court
should
presume
that
or
speculate
with
regard
to
what
the
regulations
will
be.
we
think
it’s
entirely
consistent
with
the
florida
act
which
says
this
act
was
designed
to
complement
the
federal
water
quality
improvement
act
that
certainly
as
to
questions
of
containment
gear
and
this
type
of
regulations
that
those
regulations
would
be
promulgated
to
be
consistent
with
the
regulations
of
the
federal
government.
if
i
may
just
end,
your
honor,
i
think
my
time
is
just
about
out.
we
asked
them
--
we
challenged
them
to
show
us
how
florida
and
its
citizens
would
be
able
to
receive
damages
for
cleanup.
and
they
said,
well
the
federal
government
is
coming
and
cleanup
the
beach
but
we
don’t
want
to
have
to
rely
upon
that.
we
are
not
certain
that’s
going
to
occur,
that’s
not
part
of
this
record
if
the
torrey
canyon
went
down
16
miles
off
from
florida
rather
than
16
miles
off
of
london
there
wouldn’t
have
been
no
recovery.
we
have
been
limited
to
$50.00
salvage
value
and
that’s
why
the
water
quality
improvement
act
gives
broad
powers
and
directs
the
state
to
act
and
why
is
they’re
presently
pending
before
the
senate
of
the
united
states
a
treaty
which
would
be
near
to
unlimited
liability,
$15
million
and
a
contingency
fund
and
absolute
or
strict
liability,
why
is
that
treaty
pending
if
existing
federal
law
is
enough
to
provide
cleanup
cost
and
damages?
obviously,
existing
federal
law
is
not
enough.
the
water
quality
improvement
act
seeks
to
speak
in
this
field,
directs
the
state
act.
the
state
has
acted
constitutionally.
we
ask
you
to
uphold
this
law.
