mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
of
this
appeal
if
your
honors
please
is
not
water
and
the
need
to
conserve
it
as
the
state
contends.
there
is
no
issue
whatever
between
the
appellants
and
any
of
the
appellees
concerning
the
absolute
necessity
of
maintaining
a
clean
environment
particularly
in
the
marine
area.
there’s
only
one
genuine
issue
in
our
submission
which
is
presented
here
and
that
is
whether
as
the
court
below
decided,
the
subject
of
marine
oil
pollution
like
other
subjects
of
maritime
law
should
remain
within
the
federal
domain
within
the
domain
of
the
congress
and
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
or
whether
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
concurring
opinion
in
the
wilburn
boat
case.
it
should
be
left
to
the
crazy-quilt
regulation
of
the
different
states.
in
this
connection,
we
respectfully
call
the
court’s
attention
to
table
b
annexed
to
the
brief
of
appellees
american
institute
of
merchant
shipping
and
others
which
contains
a
sampling
of
the
various
state
laws
in
this
new
field.
this
shows
that
the
clients,
if
your
honors
please
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
among
the
various
states
in
their
handling
of
the
pollution
problem.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
would
say,
your
honor
about
1924
or
a
little
before.
the
1899
refuse
act
makes
no
mention
of
oil
allow
although,
i’m
sure
you
are
aware
sir
the
courts
have
been
applying
the
1899
act
to
include
discharges
of
oil
and
have
been
finding
ship
owners
for
causing
discharges
of
oil.
but
the
first
time
oil
was
at
the
mentioned
as
such
in
a
federal
statute
was
in
1924
oil
pollution
act
which
was
amended
in
1966
and
was
repealed
by
the
water
quality
improvement
act
of
1970.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
don’t
believe
the
size
of
the
tankers
has
had
much
to
do
with
it
because
there
had
been
very
few
incidents
of
spills
of
large
quantities
of
oil
from
large
tankers.
the
torrey
canyon
of
course
is
the
most
notable
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
increased
need
for
oil
in
the
more
developed
countries
and
also
now
in
the
developing
countries
has
greatly
increased
the
need
for
ocean
tonnage
in
the
tanker
area.
and
many,
many
times
more
oil
is
being
carried
today
by
sea
than
it
was
carried
just
a
few
years
ago.
another
development,
your
honor
is
the
tendency
to
refine
or
at
destination
rather
than
at
the
source.
now
this
increases
the
potential
for
pollution
damage
but
on
the
other
hand
it
minimizes
the
number,
the
tragedies
that
resulted
from
explosions
and
fires
on
the
vessels
carrying
gasoline
and
so
on.
the
admiralty
clause
if
the
court
pleases
is
not
merely
a
constitutional
grant
of
judicial
power.
it’s
perfectly
true
that
its
couched
in
terms
of
judicial
power
but
when
read
conjunction
with
necessary
and
proper
clause,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
grants
to
congress
the
paramount
power
to
legislate
in
the
maritime
field
and
where
congress
has
not
acted
then
it
is
for
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
to
define
the
general
maritime
law
which
is
to
prevail
throughout
the
whole
country
and
not
just
in
one
area.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
mention
of
the
constitutional
clause
under
which
it
was
acting
but
is
seems
to
me
clear,
if
your
honor
please,
that
it
must
have
been
the
admiralty
clause
rather
than
the
commerce
clause
because
otherwise
what
possible
right
would
congress
have
to
pass
legislation
which
would
relate
not
only
to
vessels
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
but
even
to
local
barges
that
may
never
leave
the
waters
of
the
single
state
and
which
may
cause
damage
only
to
the
waters
of
that
state
and
to
the
shoreline
of
that
state.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
if
it
was
the
admiralty
power
then
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
the
vessel
concern
was
engaged
and
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
it
would
apply
to
a
barge
on
a
river
which
never
left
the
confines
of
the
particular
state
if
it
was
the
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
in
this
case
it
does,
if
your
honor
please,
because
of
the
innumerable
decisions
of
this
court
holding
that
uniformity
in
the
maritime
law
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
there
is
one
exception,
if
your
honor
please,
and
that
is
the
local
concern
doctrine.
if
the
matter
is
purely
one
of
local
concern
and
it’s
a
matter
concerning
which
congress
has
not
acted
then
the
states
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
that
is
right
sir.
now
it’s
proved
that
the
jensen
case
has
been
criticized
severely
as
the
attorney
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
but
i’m
wondering,
if
your
honor
please,
whether
the
criticism
of
jensen
hasn’t
been
focused
in
the
wrong
directions.
i
can
certainly
sympathize
with
those
who
feel
that
the
court
in
the
jensen
case
could
if
it
had
wished
have
decided
that
workmen’s
compensation
laws
of
a
particular
state
applied
to
shoreside
workers
when
on
board
a
vessel
loading
or
discharging
in
the
particular
state,
should
have
been
considered
as
a
matter
of
local
concern.
i
think
that’s
the
advice
of
the
jensen
case
if
there
is
any.
but
i
think
the
philosophy
behind
the
jensen
case
is
the
best
thing
that
has
ever
happened
to
the
steamship
industry
and
the
people
who
depend
on
it
for
their
profits
because
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
yes,
your
honor,
the
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
of
course
was
passed
in
order
to
remedy
the
situation
left
by
the
jensen
case
and
it
applies
to
all
workers
when
may
all
maritime
workers
engaged
in
maritime
appointment
when
they’re
on
board
the
ships.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
no,
sir
this
court
so
held
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
no
sir,
not
if
they
injured
to
shore.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
that
is
right
sir,
the
employer
must
carry.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
believe
it
could
under
the
extension
--
the
act
of
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
congress
once
chose
to
act
it
would
have
to
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
think
so
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
congress
once
chooses
to
act,
it
occupies
the
field
and
there
is
no
room
for
state
action.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
well
the,
if
your
honor
please
the
act
simply
says
that
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
deemed
to
prevent
any
state
from
enacting
water
pollution
legislation
or
words
to
that
effect.
it
doesn’t
say
that
--
it
doesn’t
state
in
a
positive
way,
it’s
more
in
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
don’t
think
that
congress
could
consistently
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
suppose
i
do
but
i
believe
it.
the
knickerbocker
ice
company
has
so
held
and
as
far
as
i’m
aware
there’s
never
been
any
decision
to
the
contrary.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
well,
that’s
right.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
that
is
right
sir.
the
line
of
cases
has
been
quite
different
and
of
course,
i
suppose
it’s
largely
historical
when
the
constitution
has
adopted
the
only
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
of
any
account
at
all
in
this
country
was
by
water.
we
have
no
railroads
or
airplanes
or
trucks.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
absolutely.
we
are
not.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
exactly
sir.
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
federal
act
preempts
the
whole
field.
it
does
not,
the
federal
act
applies
only
to
u.s.
government
clean-up
costs
and
with
reference
to
that,
if
your
honors
please,
the
attorney
general
challenges
these
to
explain
how
the
poor
hotelkeeper
whose
beaches
were
damaged
could
find
relief
in
admiralty.
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
under
the
federal
act
congress
has
appropriated
huge
sums
of
money
and
has
charged
the
federal
government
with
the
obligation
of
cleaning
up
an
oil
spill
and
no
distinction
is
made
between
government-owned
property
and
private
property
if
the
shoreline
has
damaged,
the
government
comes
in
and
cleans
it
up
if
the
owner
doesn’t
clean
it
up
and
if
the
government
doesn’t
it
then
the
government
is
entitled
to
reimbursement
subject
to
a
limitation
of
a
$100.00
per
ton
with
sealing
of
$14
million
and
subject
to
a
four
defenses:
act
of
god,
act
of
war,
negligence
of
the
government
itself
and
act
or
omission
of
the
third
party.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
no,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
no
sir
but
in
a
private
suit
of
course
the
hotelkeeper
could
sue
and
for
his
loss
profits
and
if
the
spill
were
very
bad
one
and
the
vessel
were
damaged
so
that
you
have
very
little
value
left,
it’s
true
that
the
limitation
of
liability
statute
would
be
applicable.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
yes,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
yes,
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
liability
not
only
to
shoreside
property
but
to
the
water
and
to
ships.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
as
far
as
shoreside
damage
is
concerned
we
will
not
be
here.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
with
this
reservation,
if
your
honor
please,
the
florida
act
of
course
applies
to
terminals
as
well
as
to
vessels.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
and
if
a
terminal
shoreside
facility
causes
a
spill
and
damages
cause
to
another
shoreside
installation
or
shoreside
property,
there
might
be
a
question,
a
serious
question
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
federal
substantive
law
the
general
maritime
law
applying
but
here
the
terminal
is
liable
also
for
damage
under
the
florida
act
for
damage
to
another
ship
or
for
damage
to
the
water
and
for
the
cost
of
cleaning
up
the
water
and
thus,
the
fifth
circuit
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
a
fairly
recent
case
nothing
is
more
maritime
than
the
sea.
therefore,
i
think
is
quite
conceivable
that
even
a
statute
which
was
limited
to
damage
caused
by
shoreside
installations
to
water
and
certainly
to
vessels
would
be
unconstitutional.
certainly,
the
damage
to
another
vessel
by
shoreside
installation
is
admiralty
and
was
even
before
the
1948
act.
my
colleague
governor
collins
will
continue
the
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
of

appeal
if
your

conserve
it

the

with
those
who
feel
that
the
court
in
the
jensen
case
could
if
it
had
wished
have
decided
that
workmen’s
compensation
laws
of
a
particular
state
applied
to
shoreside
workers
when
on
board
a
vessel
loading
or
discharging
in
the
particular
state,
should
have
been
considered
as
a
matter
of
local
concern.
i
think
that’s
the
advice
of
the
jensen
case
if
there
is
any.
but
i
think
the
philosophy
behind
the
jensen
case
is
the
best
thing
that
has
ever
happened
to
the
steamship
industry
and
the
people
who
depend
on
it
for
their
profits
because
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
yes,
your
honor,
the
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
of
course
was
passed
in
order
to
remedy
the
situation
left
by
the
jensen
case
and
it
applies
to
all
workers
when
may
all
maritime
workers
engaged
in
maritime
appointment
when
they’re
on
board
the
ships.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
no,
sir
this
court
so
held
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
no
sir,
not
if
they
injured
to
shore.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
that
is
right
sir,
the
employer
must
carry.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
believe
it
could
under
the
extension
--
the
act
of
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
congress
once
chose
to
act
it
would
have
to
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
think
so
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
congress
once
chooses
to
act,
it
occupies
the
field
and
there
is
no
room
for
state
action.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
well
the,
if
your
honor
please
the
act
simply
says
that
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
deemed
to
prevent
any
state
from
enacting
water
pollution
legislation
or
words
to
that
effect.
it
doesn’t
say
that
--
it
doesn’t
state
in
a
positive
way,
it’s
more
in
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
don’t
think
that
congress
could
consistently
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
i
suppose
i
do
but
i
believe
it.
the
knickerbocker
ice
company
has
so
held
and
as
far
as
i’m
aware
there’s
never
been
any
decision
to
the
contrary.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
well,
that’s
right.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
that
is
right
sir.
the
line
of
cases
has
been
quite
different
and
of
course,
i
suppose
it’s
largely
historical
when
the
constitution
has
adopted
the
only
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
of
any
account
at
all
in
this
country
was
by
water.
we
have
no
railroads
or
airplanes
or
trucks.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
absolutely.
we
are
not.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
exactly
sir.
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
federal
act
preempts
the
whole
field.
it
does
not,
the
federal
act
applies
only
to
u.s.
government
clean-up
costs
and
with
reference
to
that,
if
your
honors
please,
the
attorney
general
challenges
these
to
explain
how
the
poor
hotelkeeper
whose
beaches
were
damaged
could
find
relief
in
admiralty.
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
under
the
federal
act
congress
has
appropriated
huge
sums
of
money
and
has
charged
the
federal
government
with
the
obligation
of
cleaning
up
an
oil
spill
and
no
distinction
is
made
between
government-owned
property
and
private
property
if
the
shoreline
has
damaged,
the
government
comes
in
and
cleans
it
up
if
the
owner
doesn’t
clean
it
up
and
if
the
government
doesn’t
it
then
the
government
is
entitled
to
reimbursement
subject
to
a
limitation
of
a
$100.00
per
ton
with
sealing
of
$14
million
and
subject
to
a
four
defenses:
act
of
god,
act
of
war,
negligence
of
the
government
itself
and
act
or
omission
of
the
third
party.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
no,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
no
sir
but
in
a
private
suit
of
course
the
hotelkeeper
could
sue
and
for
his
loss
profits
and
if
the
spill
were
very
bad
one
and
the
vessel
were
damaged
so
that
you
have
very
little
value
left,
it’s
true
that
the
limitation
of
liability
statute
would
be
applicable.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
yes,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
yes,
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
liability
not
only
to
shoreside
property
but
to
the
water
and
to
ships.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
as
far
as
shoreside
damage
is
concerned
we
will
not
be
here.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
with
this
reservation,
if
your
honor
please,
the
florida
act
of
course
applies
to
terminals
as
well
as
to
vessels.
mr.
nicholas
j.
healy
and
if
a
terminal
shoreside
facility
causes
a
spill
and
damages
cause
to
another
shoreside
installation
or
shoreside
property,
there
might
be
a
question,
a
serious
question
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
federal
substantive
law
the
general
maritime
law
applying
but
here
the
terminal
is
liable
also
for
damage
under
the
florida
act
for
damage
to
another
ship
or
for
damage
to
the
water
and
for
the
cost
of
cleaning
up
the
water
and
thus,
the
fifth
circuit
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
a
fairly
recent
case
nothing
is
more
maritime
than
the
sea.
therefore,
i
think
is
quite
conceivable
that
even
a
statute
which
was
limited
to
damage
caused
by
shoreside
installations
to
water
and
certainly
to
vessels
would
be
unconstitutional.
certainly,
the
damage
to
another
vessel
by
shoreside
installation
is
admiralty
and
was
even
before
the
1948
act.
my
colleague
governor
collins
will
continue
the
argument.
thank
you.
