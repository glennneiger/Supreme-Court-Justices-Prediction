mr.

chief

e.

would
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
in
most
classified
documents
there
are
sentences
and
paragraphs
and
parts
that
are
completely
innocuous?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
the
district
judge
do
when
that
was
presented
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
read
these
provision
as
meaning
that
if
it
dell
within
number
one
of
b,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
and
no
one
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
i
remember
the
reynolds
case
correctly
the
government
had
the
choice,
was
put
to
the
choice
by
the
court.
that
was
an
airplane
crash
case
where
there
were
lot
of
military
equipment,
sites
and
various
things.
the
court
put
them
up
to
the
choice
of
either
defaulting
on
the
judgment
or
yielding
the
information,
was
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
my
point
is
that
government
have
the
choice
of
either,
wasn't
the
government
required
then
to
submit
in
terms
of
liability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
now
one
other
question
if
i
may,
the
--
going
to
the
last
line
in
the
act,
this
section
is
not
authority
to
withhold
information
from
congress.
that
declares
i
take
it
simply
that
this
act
is
not
directed
at
the
congressional
powers
to
secure
information
which
they
usually
do
by
the
subpoena
process,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
a
member
of
congress
comes
into
the
court,
he
comes
in
just
as
in
the
other
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
not
an
action
authorized
by
some
committee,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
it
mean
if
it
does
not
mean
that
mr.
clark?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
general
proposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
this
is
a
specific
exception,
is
it
not?
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
are
only
concerned
now
about
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
primarily.
when
it
says
this
section
does
not
apply
to
matters
that
are
and
then
describes
what
is
under
number
1?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
doesn't
the
new
executive
order
now
meet
that
problem
of
a
new
executive
order
that
you
have
just
referred
to,
mr.
clark
that
was
obviously
intended
to
give
more
flexibility
to
go
through
a
document
and
if
there
is
a
lot
of
material
that's
perfectly
innocuous
as
there
is
bound
to
be
in
any
classified
document
that,
that
can
be
severed
out.
with
that,
isn’t
the
problem
as
to
the
truly
classified
material
still
going
to
remain
under
section
1
or
paragraph
one
with
the
executive.
chief
justice
warren
e.

on
that
ground?
chief

warren
e.

on
prematurity
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark,
i
realize
that
subdivision
6
is
not
relevant
in
this
case
on
page
46
paragraph
6,
i
think
you
would
call
it
under
b,
but
suppose
the
personnel
and
medical
file
of
some
individual
were
involved
and
there
were
some
matter
which
he
did
not
want
disclosed.
is
it
your
view
that
a
district
judge
should
examine
the
medical
file
and
see
whether
this
should
be
disclosed
or
not
or
is
the
medical
file
of
the
treatment
of
the
person
completely
private?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
there
is
an
affidavit
of
the
commander
of
let
us
say
one
of
the
military
hospitals
that
all
the
documents
inside
of
this
file
relate
to
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
the
named
subject
and
there
is
no
matter
here
except
that
and
it
is
of
the
utmost
privacy,
some
such
statement,
then
is
a
district
judge
under
this
act
to
look
at
and
see
if
the
doctors
telling
the
truth
or
(voice

but
the
act
is
here
now,
it's
passed

i
still
have
difficulty
in
getting
away
from
the
language
this
section
does
not
apply.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
not
raising
this
question
in
terms
of
getting
this
information
in
a
lawsuit
involving
some
injuries.
i
am
talking
about
these
plaintiffs
in
this
case
or
plaintiffs
like
these
asking
that
the
information
be
made
public,
not
as
evidence
in
the
lawsuit,
just
as
a
matter
of
general
public
interest?
you
suggest
that
--

this
section
does
not
applied,
doesn't
have
very
much
meaning?
chief

warren
e.

mr.

turning
to

are
two
of

a
qualification

are
