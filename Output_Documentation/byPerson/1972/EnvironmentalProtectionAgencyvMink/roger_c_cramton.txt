mr.
roger
c.
cramton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
freedom
of
information
act
suit
was
brought
by
respondents
to
compel
the
release
of
documents
prepared
for
the
president
relating
to
the
then
proposed
and
now
completed
underground
nuclear
test
at
amchitka
island,
alaska.
it
presents
fundamental
questions
concerning
the
scope
and
application
of
exemptions
one
and
five
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
whether
documents
prepared
to
advise
the
president
with
respect
to
underground
nuclear
test,
many
of
them
containing
top
secret
and
secret
information
are
exempt
from
compulsory
disclosure
under
the
act
and
whether
a
district
court
should
be
required
to
make
an
in
camera
inspection
of
the
documents
in
order
to
determine
whether
portions
are
non-secret
or
factual
in
character.
the
facts
maybe
quickly
summarized.
on
july
28,
1971
congresswoman
mink
asked
president
nixon
to
release
reports
prepared
for
him
relating
to
the
proposed
amchitka
test.
the
president
declined
to
do
so.
his
counsel
replying
on
july
30
that
“these
recommendations
were
prepared
for
the
advise
of
the
president
and
involve
highly
sensitive
matters
that
are
vital
to
our
national
defense
and
foreign
policy.”
several
weeks
later,
respondents
instituted
this
action
pursuant
to
the
information
act.
a
separate
litigation
committee
for
a
nuclear
responsibility
versus
seaborg
the
so
called
cnr
case
was
brought
by
an
environmental
group
to
enjoin
the
test
itself.
this
court
denied
an
application
for
an
injunction
in
that
case
on
november
6,
1971,
a
little
more
than
year
ago
and
the
amchitka
test
was
conducted
successfully
later
that
same
day.
a
partial
or
total
declassification
and
public
release
of
declassified
parts
of
three
documents
involved
in
this
case
occurred
in
connection
with
the
cnr
litigation.
respondents
continue
to
seek
the
undisclosed
material,
including
three
classified
documents
not
involved
in
anyway
in
the
cnr
case.
the
district
court
in
this
case
without
in
camera
inspection
granted
the
government’s
motion
for
summary
judgment
holding
that
the
document
fell
within
exemptions
one
and
five
of
the
act.
the
district
court
relied
on
an
affidavit
of
under
secretary
of
state
irwin,
who
is
chairman
of
the
national
security
council
committee
which
prepared
the
report
for
the
president
on
the
amchitka
blast.
the
nine
documents
sought
by
respondents
are
described
in
some
detail
in
the
irwin
affidavit.
three
including
the
report
of
the
irwin
committee
itself
and
a
top
secret
report
from
dr.
kissinger
are
classified
as
top
secret.
three
others
are
classified
as
secret
including
reports
from
the
aec
and
the
office
of
science
and
technology
and
all
nine
documents
as
the
irwin
affidavit
stated
“were
prepared
and
used
solely
for
transmittal
to
the
president
as
advice
and
recommendations
and
set
forth
the
views
and
opinions
of
the
individuals
and
agencies
preparing
the
documents
so
that
the
president
might
be
fully
apprised
of
varying
viewpoints.”
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remained
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
in
camera
inspection
of
the
documents
and
a
determination
whether
disclosure
should
be
ordered
as
the
sum
of
the
materials.
it
ruled
that
document
classified
as
top
secret
and
secret
pursuant
to
executive
order
10501
should
be
reviewed
by
the
district
court
to
permit
disclosure
of
any
“non-secret
components
which
are
separable
from
the
secret
remainder.
with
respect
to
the
governments
claim
under
exemption
five
that
the
nine
documents
were
internal
memoranda
containing
policy
advice”
the
court
held
that
the
document
should
be
reviewed
in
camera
to
permit
disclosure
and
“a
factual
information
unless
it
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
policy
making
processes.”
in
both
respects
i
submit
the
court
below
was
grievously
in
error.
the
starting
point
is
the
language
of
the
act.
exemption
one
excludes
from
the
act
disclosure
requirements
“matters
specifically
required
by
executive
order
to
be
kept
secret
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
or
foreign
policy,”
matters
specifically
required
by
executive
order
to
be
kept
secret.”
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
this
language
means
what
it
says
that
the
exemption
protects
from
disclosure
governmental
records
such
as
six
of
the
nine
documents
sought
here
which
have
been
classified
as
top
secret
or
secret
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
by
executive
order
10501.
respondent’s
argument
that
the
president
must
individually
classify
each
document
by
a
separate
executive
order
is
preposterous
on
its
face.
when
congress
enacted
the
freedom
of
information
act
in
1966,
it
legislated
against
the
backdrop
of
many
years
of
operation
of
the
classification
system.
executive
order
10501
which
has
provided
the
basis
for
classification
of
the
defense
information
since
1953,
was
repeatedly
referred
to,
during
congressional
consideration
of
exemption
one
and
clearly
it
is
an
executive
order
which
“specifically
requires
certain
matters
specified
therein
to
be
kept
secret.”
when
a
document
is
properly
classified
pursuant
to
the
applicable
executive
order,
the
government
is
not
required
to
review
the
document
paragraph
by
paragraph
to
determine
whether
portions
of
it
are
non-secret
and
maybe
disclose.
executive
order
10501
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
treats
the
document
as
the
appropriate
unit
for
classification
purposes.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
is
a
different
in
degree.
the
language
of
both
executive
orders
the
new
and
the
old
are
require
somewhat
greater
showing
of
jeopardy
to
national
defense
and
foreign
policy
interest
for
classification
as
top
secret
rather
than
secret.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
both
executive
orders
spell
out
in
its
clear
languages
as
available
to
the
drafts
matters
which
were
vital
to
national
defense
that
the
latest
executive
order
mentions
(vice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
and
then
there
is
confidential
(voice
overlap).
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
is
just
a
matter
of
degree
and
the
most
secret
and
sensitive
data
falls
into
the
top
secret
category,
but
once
a
document
which
contains
vital
defense
information
has
been
classified,
all
material
in
a
particular
document
is
protected
under
exemption
one.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
there
may
well
be.
now
in
many
cases
it
will
be
impossible
as
a
practical
and
administrative
matter
to
separate
them
all.
in
many
cases
there
will
be
inextricably
intertwined.
there
maybe
situations
in
which
only
a
very
small
portion
of
a
large
document
deals
with
classified
matters.
now
many
agencies
have
regulations
that
require
paragraph
by
paragraph
classification.
and
the
new
executive
order
extends
that
practice
more
generally
to
the
federal
government
as
a
whole
to
the
extent
practical.
my
point
is
the
congress
adopted
the
executive
orders
and
deferred
to
the
procedures
applicable
under
those
executive
orders
and
those
executive
orders
referred
to
the
document
as
a
whole
except
to
the
extent
that
the
new
executive
order
promulgated
last
spring
does
push
agencies
in
the
direction
of
a
paragraph
by
paragraph
marking
of
paragraphs
of
a
larger
document.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
significance
is
very
considerable
under
some
of
the
exemptions
of
act.
i
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
congress
has
said
that
the
matter
is
exempt
in
a
meaningful
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
if
it
is
classified
pursuant
to
an
executive
order
dealing
with
the
national
defense
information.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
right.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
but
absolutely
no
reason
from
the
affidavit
itself
in
the
surrounding
circumstances
to
question
the
assertions
in
the
affidavit
itself
and
the
circumstances
of
the
test,
here
we're
dealing
with
a
weapon's
test
in
the
atomic
field,
in
an
area
in
which
it
is
known
not
that
only
our
technological
lead
in
the
military
field
is
vital
to
our
national
defense
but
also
with
an
area
which
is
well
known
because
of
the
treaty
obligations,
because
of
the
international
--
the
sensitivity
of
the
international
community
on
these
matters
where
it
is
well
known
that
there
are
foreign
policy
repercussions
and
the
irwin
affidavit
places
those
documents
plainly
in
the
sixth
that
the
to
which
exemption
one
applies
squarely
with
an
a
core
area
of
the
interest
that
congress
intended
to
protect
and
remain
privileged.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no,
not
entirely.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
court
may
properly
impose
a
burden
on
the
government
to
supply
an
affidavit
which
lays
out,
that
describes
the
documents
and
which
lays
out
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
government
did
that
here.
now
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
likelihood
or
the
plausibility
of
any
secret
matter
being
involved
then
further
inquiry
by
the
court
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
surely
is
in
this
area.
the
holding
of
the
court
below
is
totally
novel.
it
is
the
first
case
which
has
ordered
the
united
states
to
produce
for
in
camera
inspection
documents
which
the
united
states
claimed
and
plausibly
showed
by
the
surrounding
circumstances
in
the
affidavit
were
military
or
state
secrets.
this
is
the
first
case
of
that
kind
and
let
me
refer
to
some
of
the
earlier
precedents
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
i
do
not
see
how
anyone
could
doubt
that
the
yield,
the
methods,
the
scientific
technology
involved
--
the
testing
of
atomic
weapons
involves
the
most
vital
and
sensitive
matters
to
our
national
security.
and
anyone
could
think
that
a
nuclear
weapons
test
in
the
present
international
climate
is
not
also
a
matter
which
involves
vital
foreign
relations
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
it
does
not,
but
it
says
that
the
documents
were
prepared
to
(voice
overlap)
president
and
that
they
contain
classified
and
secret
information.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
same
way
that
you
test
a
claim
of
the
privileged
against
self
incrimination.
you
do
not
require
the
defendant
who
claims
or
the
witness
who
claims
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
to
incriminate
himself
even
before
the
judge
in
camera
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
protection
which
the
law
is
designed
to
extent
to
it.
all
you
require
is
that
you
give
a
hint
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
--
as
to
why
an
apparently
innocuous
question
mainly
to
the
discovery
of
a
clue
to
information
that
maybe
incriminated.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
i
do,
i
think
under
our
constitutional
scheme.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
--
the
operation
of
the
office
of
president
just
as
the
operation
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
judiciary,
just
as
the
operation
of
the
congress
is
an
extremely
important
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
limited
role
of
the
courts
in
passing
upon
classification
determinations
of
the
executive
branch
is
well
established
in
prior
decisions.
we
discuss
the
epstein
case
in
our
brief.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
is
purely
a
matter
of
statute
except
that
you
have
to
act
and
interpret
the
statute
as
the
court
always
does
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
backdrop.
no
claim
of
executive
privilege
has
been
made
in
this
case,
but
the
information
act
does
offer
a
great
potential
and
a
great
risk
of
direct
conflict
between
coordinate
branches
of
government.
when
the
same
question
comes
up
in
connection
with
the
privilege
for
state
secrets,
and
prior
to
civil
litigation
or
litigation
which
the
government
is
a
part
of
it,
there
is
never
a
direct
order
to
a
government
official
to
produce
or
go
to
jail.
what
happens
is
the
government
is
penalized
in
litigation
if
it
refuses
to
produce
information
that
the
court
believes
is
relevant
to
the
opponent’s
case.
the
information
act
context
is
very
different
because
in
information
act
context,
you
run
the
risk
of
an
order
directed
to
the
executive
to
produce
the
materials
which
the
executive
may
believe
are
in
fact
constitutionally
privileged
as
well
as
privileged
under
the
statute.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
he
is
supposed
to
determine
whether
portions
of
the
documents
maybe
safely
revealed
to
the
public.
now
it's
our
view
that,
that
is
an
inquiry
that
district
judges
should
not
make.
one
it
invites
them
to
substitute
their
judgment
for
the
executive
who
is
made
the
classification
determination.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
government
does
not
contest
that
part
of
the
case,
the
decision
below
that
deals
with
classification
by
association.
neither
the
earlier
executive
order
nor
the
new
executive
order
protect
documents
which
contain
no
classified
material,
but
happen
to
be
in
a
classified
file.
we
do
not
content
that
unclassified
documents
inside
a
large
file
are
protected.
we
do
content
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
what's
under
b
(1),
i
--?
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that's
right.
our
petition
for
certiorari
says
we
do
not
contest
that
part
of
the
case.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
executive
order
requires
documents
to
be
classified
on
a
basis
of
the
information,
they
contend.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no,
no
we
do
claim
that
the
exemption
one
is
applicable
here.
the
exemption
one
is
applicable
as
to
six
of
the
nine
documents
which
are
involved.
what
we
have
--
what
we
do
not
content
is
the
doctrine
of
so
called
classification
by
association
that
was
discussed
the
court
of
appeals.
we
do
contend
that
the
district
court
should
not
examine
in
camera
top
secret
or
secret
documents
in
order
to
determine
whether
they
were
properly
classified,
whether
they
contain
secret
material
or
whether
a
portion
of
them
properly
be
made
available
to
the
public.
we
think
that
the
district
judge
just
does
not
have
the
informational
base
to
do
that
and
particularly
if
it
has
to
be
done
in
camera
without
the
assistance
of
the
advisory
process.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
has
to
be
interpreted
in
the
past
history
and
in
light
of
dealing
with
military
or
state
secrets
which
is
the
correlative
evidentiary
privilege
that
has
existed
and
which
this
court
construed
in
the
reynolds
case
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
--
in
which
the
court
said,
the
court
should
not
make
an
in
camera
investigation,
even
in
chambers
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
it
was
not.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
but
it
was
adopted
in
the
background
and
light
and
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
not
asking
the
courts
to
second
guess
the
classification
determinations
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
means
under
exemption
one
is
to
whether
or
not
at
the
most
the
classification
or
determination
made
by
the
executive
is
not
arbitrary
or
capricious.
the
government
can
be
required
to
show
by
an
affidavit
in
the
surrounding
circumstances
that
secret
material
is
involved
and
that
is
surely
been
done
here
as
(voice
overlap).
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
there
is
not.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
even
the
respondents
do
not
content
that
the
advisory
process
is
going
to
be
fully
operated
here
and
the
high
government
officials
are
going
to
be
asked
to
testify
and
the
cross
examination
is
to
the
exact
content
of
this
document.
how
could
anything
be
maintained
secret?
any
person
in
bringing
the
information
suit
could
then
get
the
secrets
revealed
merely
in
a
process
of
trying
to
find
out
whether
or
not
they
were
exempt
and
i
think
the
analogy
--
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
of
the
procedure
used
in
the
application
of
other
privileges,
are
highly
relevant
here
and
the
reynolds
case,
the
epstein
case
are
directly
implying.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
means
that
the
court
should
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
information
that
satisfies
it
that
the
exemption
is
applicable
and
here
the
government’s
affidavit
and
the
surrounding
circumstances
do
provide
information
which
show
that
military
secrets
and
foreign
policy
secrets
are
involved
here
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
he
accepted
that
contention
and
he
did
not
examine
the
documents
and
respondents
have
appealed.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
sir.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
says,
it
does
not
apply
to
matter,
is
that
specifically
required
by
executive
order
and
i
think
that
falls
clearly
within
the
language
of
this
case
(voice
overlap)
an
exemption
despite
arguably
seems
to
me
with
give
rise
to
somewhat
more
discretion
on
the
court
because
it
refers
in
its
own
language
to
the
procedures
used
by
the
courts
in
civil
litigation
on
discovery.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
i
think
it
applies
to
the
entire
act,
but
it
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
preferred
exemptions
and
desire
of
congress
to
protect
certain
material
from
public
disclosure?
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
the
government's
view.
now
we
do
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
we
do
concede
that
the
government
by
affidavit
has
and
surrounding
circumstances
has
to
make
a
showing
that
at
least
you
are
in
the
area
of
state
secrets.
for
example,
if
the
respondent
has
sought
documents
dealing
with
hog
prices
on
the
chicago
marketing
put
together
by
the
department
of
agriculture,
there
might
be
some
judges
who
would
be
properly
skeptical
of
whether
or
not
state
secrets
were
involved
and
the
court
could
properly
require
a
more
detailed
affidavit
which
would
convince
the
court
of
whether
or
not
you
were
in
the
core
area
that
the
privilege
was
designed
to
protect
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
(voice
overlap)
the
interest
you're
trying
to
protect
in
the
process
of
showing
whether
or
not
the
privilege
is
applicable.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
the
court
can
require
more
than
that
and
you
know
more
than
that.
amchitka
test
blast
involving
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
is
the
documents
prepared
by
dr.
kissinger
and
the
national
security
council
and
so
on.
you
know
a
great
deal
more
and
you
know
that
all
of
the
information
that
relates
to
environmental
matters
which
bushel
baskets
of
it
has
already
been
made
public.
what
the
respondents
want
are
the
advice
given
to
the
president
in
connection
within
the
secret
underground
military
weapon's
test
and
the
military
secrets
that
are
involved
in
those
documents.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
well
exemption
5
is
designed
to
protect
the
decisional
deliberative
process
of
government
itself
and
make
sure
that
deciders
get
candid
and
frank
advice
just
as
this
court
needs
it
among
itself
and
with
its
personnel.
now
it's
argued
that
all
of
the
documents
involved
in
this
litigations
fall
within
exemption
5.
under
secretary
irwin’s
affidavit
states
that
these
documents
were
prepared
and
used
solely
for
transmittal
to
the
president
as
advice
and
recommendation
and
respondents
concede
that
that's
the
case.
congresswoman
mink
request
for
the
document
was
to
the
president
and
she
said
she
wanted
the
reports
and
recommendations
that
he
had
received.
the
argument
is,
that
the
district
court
should
look
at
this
reports
and
recommendations
of
advice
and
try
to
separate
out
the
factual
material
from
the
judgmental
and
policy
material.
well,
in
first
place
i
do
not
think
that
can
be
done
and
particularly
in
the
context
of
presidential
decision
making.
he
who
has
headed
the
heads
of
agencies
and
the
most
trusted
advisers
being
forced
to
briefly
condense
their
facts
and
arguments
so
the
president
can
decide
an
important
national
issue.
the
selection
of
facts,
the
organization
of
facts,
the
arguments
and
the
relationship
arguments
is
fully
as
much
of
the
policy
making
process
as
a
selection
of
facts
and
arguments
in
a
brief
is
part
of
the
art
of
advocacy.
so
the
separation
in
the
light
of
this
case
it
seems
to
me
to
point
to
the
entire
documents
clearly
falling
within
the
court
area
of
privilege.
now
the
decisions
say
that
where
you
have
low
level
routine
factual
reports
that
those
can
be
made
available
and
the
district
court
can
properly
separate
out
judgmental
or
policy
aspects
that
are
usually
found
in
introductory
paragraphs
for
conclusions,
but
you
do
not
have
that
kind
of
a
case
here.
whatever
maybe
done
in
cases
that
deal
with
such
matters
and
scientific
testing
of
va
hearing
aids
or
with
the
routine
appraisal
of
property
by
a
government
appraiser
or
with
the
inspection
of
the
physical
wreckage
of
a
plane
by
government
mechanics
whatever
maybe
done
in
those
cases
in
terms
of
a
more
detailed
affidavit
or
even
in
some
instances
an
in
camera
inspection
is
not
appropriate
here
where
we
have
the
highest
level
of
decisions,
where
we
have
a
special
matter
of
great
importance,
complexity
and
delicacy
in
which
falls
right
in
the
core
area
that
congress
was
trying
to
protect
with
exemption
5.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
may
correct
you,
i
think
that
it
is
not.
in
reynolds
case,
government
affidavits
and
government
affidavits
alone
asserted
that,
that
plane
had
been
in
connection
with
the
testing
of
a
military
airplane
that
was
involved
secret
electronic
equipment.
that
affidavit
was
accepted
on
its
face
by
this
court
and
this
court
went
on
and
said
that
on
that
kind
of
showing
with
the
surrounding
circumstances,
the
aircraft
investigation
report
would
not
be
made
available
even
to
the
judge
in
camera
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
court
actually
went
on
and
held
that
with
the
since
the
tort
claims
act
had
waved
the
liability
of
the
united
states
only
under
such
conditions
as
it
is
send
to
but
you
could
not
penalize
the
government
where
it
was
defendant
on
the
tort
claims
act,
but
in
the
civil
litigation,
in
the
criminal
prosecution
situation
were
the
same
question
arises
that
is
the
result
that
usually
reached.
that
is
the
government
is
penalized
as
a
litigant
because
it
does
not
supply
information
that
the
court
claims
is
relevant
and
the
government
then
has
the
option,
unlike
the
freedom
of
information
act
situation
of
losing
the
litigation
or
abandoning
it
and
preserving
a
secrecy
of
information
that
it
thinks
should
not
be
divulged
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
yes,
it's
mr.
justice
5,
it
may
require
part
two.
it's
an
exemption
from
all
the
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
if
i
might
clarify
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that's
right,
and
if
i
may
clarify
your
comment,
constitutional
questions
is
involved
here
only
in
the
sense
that
they
provide
a
backdrop
for
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
common
law
questions
are
involved
in
connection
with
exemption
5,
because
exemption
5
by
its
very
language
refers
to
whether
or
not
a
private
party
in
a
hypothetical
litigation
with
the
government
would
be
able
on
discovery
to
get
that
information
from
the
government.
the
rule
is
that
it
would
if
information
can
be
made
available.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
right.
i
did
not
see
fit
to
stress
or
reply
to
respondent's
argument
that
congressman
has
special
rights
under
this
act.
it
is
clear
that
they
do
not.
the
rights
of
the
act
extend
to
any
member
of
the
public.
the
language
in
paragraph
c
on
page
47
is
clearly
a
savings
clause.
it's
just
as
we
have
--
this
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
powers
of
congress
as
an
institution
to
compel
information
and
it
surely
is
a
somewhat
i
think
even
shocking
notion
that
an
individual
congressman
could
compel
information
either
from
the
government
or
from
other
private
citizens
just
on
his
own
say
so.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
right.
the
law
treats
all
equally.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
the
congress
is
not
involved
in
any
institutional
capacity.
the
respondents
are
acting
in
their
individual
capacities
only
as
“any
persons
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.”
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
freedom
of
information
act
suit
was
brought
by
respondents
to
compel
the
release
of
documents
prepared
for
the
president
relating
to
the
then
proposed
and
now
completed
underground
nuclear
test
at
amchitka
island,
alaska.
it
presents
fundamental
questions
concerning
the
scope
and
application
of
exemptions
one
and
five
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
whether
documents
prepared
to
advise
the
president
with
respect
to
underground
nuclear
test,
many
of
them
containing
top
secret
and
secret
information
are
exempt
from
compulsory
disclosure
under
the
act
and
whether
a
district
court
should
be
required
to
make
an
in
camera
inspection
of
the
documents
in
order
to
determine
whether
portions
are
non-secret
or
factual
in
character.
the
facts
maybe
quickly
summarized.
on
july
28,
1971
congresswoman
mink
asked
president
nixon
to
release
reports
prepared
for
him
relating
to
the
proposed
amchitka
test.
the
president
declined
to
do
so.
his
counsel
replying
on
july
30
that
“these
recommendations
were
prepared
for
the
advise
of
the
president
and
involve
highly
sensitive
matters
that
are
vital
to
our
national
defense
and
foreign
policy.”
several
weeks
later,
respondents
instituted
this
action
pursuant
to
the
information
act.
a
separate
litigation
committee
for
a
nuclear
responsibility
versus
seaborg
the
so
called
cnr
case
was
brought
by
an
environmental
group
to
enjoin
the
test
itself.
this
court
denied
an
application
for
an
injunction
in
that
case
on
november
6,
1971,
a
little
more
than
year
ago
and
the
amchitka
test
was
conducted
successfully
later
that
same
day.
a
partial
or
total
declassification
and
public
release
of
declassified
parts
of
three
documents
involved
in
this
case
occurred
in
connection
with
the
cnr
litigation.
respondents
continue
to
seek
the
undisclosed
material,
including
three
classified
documents
not
involved
in
anyway
in
the
cnr
case.
the
district
court
in
this
case
without
in
camera
inspection
granted
the
government’s
motion
for
summary
judgment
holding
that
the
document
fell
within
exemptions
one
and
five
of
the
act.
the
district
court
relied
on
an
affidavit
of
under
secretary
of
state
irwin,
who
is
chairman
of
the
national
security
council
committee
which
prepared
the
report
for
the
president
on
the
amchitka
blast.
the
nine
documents
sought
by
respondents
are
described
in
some
detail
in
the
irwin
affidavit.
three
including
the
report
of
the
irwin
committee
itself
and
a
top
secret
report
from
dr.
kissinger
are
classified
as
top
secret.
three
others
are
classified
as
secret
including
reports
from
the
aec
and
the
office
of
science
and
technology
and
all
nine
documents
as
the
irwin
affidavit
stated
“were
prepared
and
used
solely
for
transmittal
to
the
president
as
advice
and
recommendations
and
set
forth
the
views
and
opinions
of
the
individuals
and
agencies
preparing
the
documents
so
that
the
president
might
be
fully
apprised
of
varying
viewpoints.”
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remained
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
in
camera
inspection
of
the
documents
and
a
determination
whether
disclosure
should
be
ordered
as
the
sum
of
the
materials.
it
ruled
that
document
classified
as
top
secret
and
secret
pursuant
to
executive
order
10501
should
be
reviewed
by
the
district
court
to
permit
disclosure
of
any
“non-secret
components
which
are
separable
from
the
secret
remainder.
with
respect
to
the
governments
claim
under
exemption
five
that
the
nine
documents
were
internal
memoranda
containing
policy
advice”
the
court
held
that
the
document
should
be
reviewed
in
camera
to
permit
disclosure
and
“a
factual
information
unless
it
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
policy
making
processes.”
in
both
respects
i
submit
the
court
below
was
grievously
in
error.
the
starting
point
is
the
language
of
the
act.
exemption
one
excludes
from
the
act
disclosure
requirements
“matters
specifically
required
by
executive
order
to
be
kept
secret
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
or
foreign
policy,”
matters
specifically
required
by
executive
order
to
be
kept
secret.”
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
this
language
means
what
it
says
that
the
exemption
protects
from
disclosure
governmental
records
such
as
six
of
the
nine
documents
sought
here
which
have
been
classified
as
top
secret
or
secret
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
by
executive
order
10501.
respondent’s
argument
that
the
president
must
individually
classify
each
document
by
a
separate
executive
order
is
preposterous
on
its
face.
when
congress
enacted
the
freedom
of
information
act
in
1966,
it
legislated
against
the
backdrop
of
many
years
of
operation
of
the
classification
system.
executive
order
10501
which
has
provided
the
basis
for
classification
of
the
defense
information
since
1953,
was
repeatedly
referred
to,
during
congressional
consideration
of
exemption
one
and
clearly
it
is
an
executive
order
which
“specifically
requires
certain
matters
specified
therein
to
be
kept
secret.”
when
a
document
is
properly
classified
pursuant
to
the
applicable
executive
order,
the
government
is
not
required
to
review
the
document
paragraph
by
paragraph
to
determine
whether
portions
of
it
are
non-secret
and
maybe
disclose.
executive
order
10501
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
treats
the
document
as
the
appropriate
unit
for
classification
purposes.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
is
a
different
in
degree.
the
language
of
both
executive
orders
the
new
and
the
old
are
require
somewhat
greater
showing
of
jeopardy
to
national
defense
and
foreign
policy
interest
for
classification
as
top
secret
rather
than
secret.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
both
executive
orders
spell
out
in
its
clear
languages
as
available
to
the
drafts
matters
which
were
vital
to
national
defense
that
the
latest
executive
order
mentions
(vice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
and
then
there
is
confidential
(voice
overlap).
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
is
just
a
matter
of
degree
and
the
most
secret
and
sensitive
data
falls
into
the
top
secret
category,
but
once
a
document
which
contains
vital
defense
information
has
been
classified,
all
material
in
a
particular
document
is
protected
under
exemption
one.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
there
may
well
be.
now
in
many
cases
it
will
be
impossible
as
a
practical
and
administrative
matter
to
separate
them
all.
in
many
cases
there
will
be
inextricably
intertwined.
there
maybe
situations
in
which
only
a
very
small
portion
of
a
large
document
deals
with
classified
matters.
now
many
agencies
have
regulations
that
require
paragraph
by
paragraph
classification.
and
the
new
executive
order
extends
that
practice
more
generally
to
the
federal
government
as
a
whole
to
the
extent
practical.
my
point
is
the
congress
adopted
the
executive
orders
and
deferred
to
the
procedures
applicable
under
those
executive
orders
and
those
executive
orders
referred
to
the
document
as
a
whole
except
to
the
extent
that
the
new
executive
order
promulgated
last
spring
does
push
agencies
in
the
direction
of
a
paragraph
by
paragraph
marking
of
paragraphs
of
a
larger
document.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
significance
is
very
considerable
under
some
of
the
exemptions
of
act.
i
think
(voice
overlap).
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
congress
has
said
that
the
matter
is
exempt
in
a
meaningful
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
if
it
is
classified
pursuant
to
an
executive
order
dealing
with
the
national
defense
information.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
right.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
but
absolutely
no
reason
from
the
affidavit
itself
in
the
surrounding
circumstances
to
question
the
assertions
in
the
affidavit
itself
and
the
circumstances
of
the
test,
here
we're
dealing
with
a
weapon's
test
in
the
atomic
field,
in
an
area
in
which
it
is
known
not
that
only
our
technological
lead
in
the
military
field
is
vital
to
our
national
defense
but
also
with
an
area
which
is
well
known
because
of
the
treaty
obligations,
because
of
the
international
--
the
sensitivity
of
the
international
community
on
these
matters
where
it
is
well
known
that
there
are
foreign
policy
repercussions
and
the
irwin
affidavit
places
those
documents
plainly
in
the
sixth
that
the
to
which
exemption
one
applies
squarely
with
an
a
core
area
of
the
interest
that
congress
intended
to
protect
and
remain
privileged.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no,
not
entirely.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
court
may
properly
impose
a
burden
on
the
government
to
supply
an
affidavit
which
lays
out,
that
describes
the
documents
and
which
lays
out
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
government
did
that
here.
now
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
likelihood
or
the
plausibility
of
any
secret
matter
being
involved
then
further
inquiry
by
the
court
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
surely
is
in
this
area.
the
holding
of
the
court
below
is
totally
novel.
it
is
the
first
case
which
has
ordered
the
united
states
to
produce
for
in
camera
inspection
documents
which
the
united
states
claimed
and
plausibly
showed
by
the
surrounding
circumstances
in
the
affidavit
were
military
or
state
secrets.
this
is
the
first
case
of
that
kind
and
let
me
refer
to
some
of
the
earlier
precedents
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
i
do
not
see
how
anyone
could
doubt
that
the
yield,
the
methods,
the
scientific
technology
involved
--
the
testing
of
atomic
weapons
involves
the
most
vital
and
sensitive
matters
to
our
national
security.
and
anyone
could
think
that
a
nuclear
weapons
test
in
the
present
international
climate
is
not
also
a
matter
which
involves
vital
foreign
relations
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
it
does
not,
but
it
says
that
the
documents
were
prepared
to
(voice
overlap)
president
and
that
they
contain
classified
and
secret
information.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
same
way
that
you
test
a
claim
of
the
privileged
against
self
incrimination.
you
do
not
require
the
defendant
who
claims
or
the
witness
who
claims
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
to
incriminate
himself
even
before
the
judge
in
camera
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
protection
which
the
law
is
designed
to
extent
to
it.
all
you
require
is
that
you
give
a
hint
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
--
as
to
why
an
apparently
innocuous
question
mainly
to
the
discovery
of
a
clue
to
information
that
maybe
incriminated.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
i
do,
i
think
under
our
constitutional
scheme.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
--
the
operation
of
the
office
of
president
just
as
the
operation
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
judiciary,
just
as
the
operation
of
the
congress
is
an
extremely
important
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
limited
role
of
the
courts
in
passing
upon
classification
determinations
of
the
executive
branch
is
well
established
in
prior
decisions.
we
discuss
the
epstein
case
in
our
brief.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
is
purely
a
matter
of
statute
except
that
you
have
to
act
and
interpret
the
statute
as
the
court
always
does
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
backdrop.
no
claim
of
executive
privilege
has
been
made
in
this
case,
but
the
information
act
does
offer
a
great
potential
and
a
great
risk
of
direct
conflict
between
coordinate
branches
of
government.
when
the
same
question
comes
up
in
connection
with
the
privilege
for
state
secrets,
and
prior
to
civil
litigation
or
litigation
which
the
government
is
a
part
of
it,
there
is
never
a
direct
order
to
a
government
official
to
produce
or
go
to
jail.
what
happens
is
the
government
is
penalized
in
litigation
if
it
refuses
to
produce
information
that
the
court
believes
is
relevant
to
the
opponent’s
case.
the
information
act
context
is
very
different
because
in
information
act
context,
you
run
the
risk
of
an
order
directed
to
the
executive
to
produce
the
materials
which
the
executive
may
believe
are
in
fact
constitutionally
privileged
as
well
as
privileged
under
the
statute.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
he
is
supposed
to
determine
whether
portions
of
the
documents
maybe
safely
revealed
to
the
public.
now
it's
our
view
that,
that
is
an
inquiry
that
district
judges
should
not
make.
one
it
invites
them
to
substitute
their
judgment
for
the
executive
who
is
made
the
classification
determination.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
government
does
not
contest
that
part
of
the
case,
the
decision
below
that
deals
with
classification
by
association.
neither
the
earlier
executive
order
nor
the
new
executive
order
protect
documents
which
contain
no
classified
material,
but
happen
to
be
in
a
classified
file.
we
do
not
content
that
unclassified
documents
inside
a
large
file
are
protected.
we
do
content
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
what's
under
b
(1),
i
--?
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that's
right.
our
petition
for
certiorari
says
we
do
not
contest
that
part
of
the
case.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
executive
order
requires
documents
to
be
classified
on
a
basis
of
the
information,
they
contend.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no,
no
we
do
claim
that
the
exemption
one
is
applicable
here.
the
exemption
one
is
applicable
as
to
six
of
the
nine
documents
which
are
involved.
what
we
have
--
what
we
do
not
content
is
the
doctrine
of
so
called
classification
by
association
that
was
discussed
the
court
of
appeals.
we
do
contend
that
the
district
court
should
not
examine
in
camera
top
secret
or
secret
documents
in
order
to
determine
whether
they
were
properly
classified,
whether
they
contain
secret
material
or
whether
a
portion
of
them
properly
be
made
available
to
the
public.
we
think
that
the
district
judge
just
does
not
have
the
informational
base
to
do
that
and
particularly
if
it
has
to
be
done
in
camera
without
the
assistance
of
the
advisory
process.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
has
to
be
interpreted
in
the
past
history
and
in
light
of
dealing
with
military
or
state
secrets
which
is
the
correlative
evidentiary
privilege
that
has
existed
and
which
this
court
construed
in
the
reynolds
case
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
--
in
which
the
court
said,
the
court
should
not
make
an
in
camera
investigation,
even
in
chambers
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
it
was
not.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
but
it
was
adopted
in
the
background
and
light
and
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
not
asking
the
courts
to
second
guess
the
classification
determinations
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
means
under
exemption
one
is
to
whether
or
not
at
the
most
the
classification
or
determination
made
by
the
executive
is
not
arbitrary
or
capricious.
the
government
can
be
required
to
show
by
an
affidavit
in
the
surrounding
circumstances
that
secret
material
is
involved
and
that
is
surely
been
done
here
as
(voice
overlap).
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
there
is
not.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
even
the
respondents
do
not
content
that
the
advisory
process
is
going
to
be
fully
operated
here
and
the
high
government
officials
are
going
to
be
asked
to
testify
and
the
cross
examination
is
to
the
exact
content
of
this
document.
how
could
anything
be
maintained
secret?
any
person
in
bringing
the
information
suit
could
then
get
the
secrets
revealed
merely
in
a
process
of
trying
to
find
out
whether
or
not
they
were
exempt
and
i
think
the
analogy
--
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
of
the
procedure
used
in
the
application
of
other
privileges,
are
highly
relevant
here
and
the
reynolds
case,
the
epstein
case
are
directly
implying.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
means
that
the
court
should
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
information
that
satisfies
it
that
the
exemption
is
applicable
and
here
the
government’s
affidavit
and
the
surrounding
circumstances
do
provide
information
which
show
that
military
secrets
and
foreign
policy
secrets
are
involved
here
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
he
accepted
that
contention
and
he
did
not
examine
the
documents
and
respondents
have
appealed.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
sir.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
it
says,
it
does
not
apply
to
matter,
is
that
specifically
required
by
executive
order
and
i
think
that
falls
clearly
within
the
language
of
this
case
(voice
overlap)
an
exemption
despite
arguably
seems
to
me
with
give
rise
to
somewhat
more
discretion
on
the
court
because
it
refers
in
its
own
language
to
the
procedures
used
by
the
courts
in
civil
litigation
on
discovery.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
i
think
it
applies
to
the
entire
act,
but
it
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
preferred
exemptions
and
desire
of
congress
to
protect
certain
material
from
public
disclosure?
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
the
government's
view.
now
we
do
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
we
do
concede
that
the
government
by
affidavit
has
and
surrounding
circumstances
has
to
make
a
showing
that
at
least
you
are
in
the
area
of
state
secrets.
for
example,
if
the
respondent
has
sought
documents
dealing
with
hog
prices
on
the
chicago
marketing
put
together
by
the
department
of
agriculture,
there
might
be
some
judges
who
would
be
properly
skeptical
of
whether
or
not
state
secrets
were
involved
and
the
court
could
properly
require
a
more
detailed
affidavit
which
would
convince
the
court
of
whether
or
not
you
were
in
the
core
area
that
the
privilege
was
designed
to
protect
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
(voice
overlap)
the
interest
you're
trying
to
protect
in
the
process
of
showing
whether
or
not
the
privilege
is
applicable.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
the
court
can
require
more
than
that
and
you
know
more
than
that.
amchitka
test
blast
involving
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
is
the
documents
prepared
by
dr.
kissinger
and
the
national
security
council
and
so
on.
you
know
a
great
deal
more
and
you
know
that
all
of
the
information
that
relates
to
environmental
matters
which
bushel
baskets
of
it
has
already
been
made
public.
what
the
respondents
want
are
the
advice
given
to
the
president
in
connection
within
the
secret
underground
military
weapon's
test
and
the
military
secrets
that
are
involved
in
those
documents.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
well
exemption
5
is
designed
to
protect
the
decisional
deliberative
process
of
government
itself
and
make
sure
that
deciders
get
candid
and
frank
advice
just
as
this
court
needs
it
among
itself
and
with
its
personnel.
now
it's
argued
that
all
of
the
documents
involved
in
this
litigations
fall
within
exemption
5.
under
secretary
irwin’s
affidavit
states
that
these
documents
were
prepared
and
used
solely
for
transmittal
to
the
president
as
advice
and
recommendation
and
respondents
concede
that
that's
the
case.
congresswoman
mink
request
for
the
document
was
to
the
president
and
she
said
she
wanted
the
reports
and
recommendations
that
he
had
received.
the
argument
is,
that
the
district
court
should
look
at
this
reports
and
recommendations
of
advice
and
try
to
separate
out
the
factual
material
from
the
judgmental
and
policy
material.
well,
in
first
place
i
do
not
think
that
can
be
done
and
particularly
in
the
context
of
presidential
decision
making.
he
who
has
headed
the
heads
of
agencies
and
the
most
trusted
advisers
being
forced
to
briefly
condense
their
facts
and
arguments
so
the
president
can
decide
an
important
national
issue.
the
selection
of
facts,
the
organization
of
facts,
the
arguments
and
the
relationship
arguments
is
fully
as
much
of
the
policy
making
process
as
a
selection
of
facts
and
arguments
in
a
brief
is
part
of
the
art
of
advocacy.
so
the
separation
in
the
light
of
this
case
it
seems
to
me
to
point
to
the
entire
documents
clearly
falling
within
the
court
area
of
privilege.
now
the
decisions
say
that
where
you
have
low
level
routine
factual
reports
that
those
can
be
made
available
and
the
district
court
can
properly
separate
out
judgmental
or
policy
aspects
that
are
usually
found
in
introductory
paragraphs
for
conclusions,
but
you
do
not
have
that
kind
of
a
case
here.
whatever
maybe
done
in
cases
that
deal
with
such
matters
and
scientific
testing
of
va
hearing
aids
or
with
the
routine
appraisal
of
property
by
a
government
appraiser
or
with
the
inspection
of
the
physical
wreckage
of
a
plane
by
government
mechanics
whatever
maybe
done
in
those
cases
in
terms
of
a
more
detailed
affidavit
or
even
in
some
instances
an
in
camera
inspection
is
not
appropriate
here
where
we
have
the
highest
level
of
decisions,
where
we
have
a
special
matter
of
great
importance,
complexity
and
delicacy
in
which
falls
right
in
the
core
area
that
congress
was
trying
to
protect
with
exemption
5.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
may
correct
you,
i
think
that
it
is
not.
in
reynolds
case,
government
affidavits
and
government
affidavits
alone
asserted
that,
that
plane
had
been
in
connection
with
the
testing
of
a
military
airplane
that
was
involved
secret
electronic
equipment.
that
affidavit
was
accepted
on
its
face
by
this
court
and
this
court
went
on
and
said
that
on
that
kind
of
showing
with
the
surrounding
circumstances,
the
aircraft
investigation
report
would
not
be
made
available
even
to
the
judge
in
camera
(voice
overlap)
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
the
court
actually
went
on
and
held
that
with
the
since
the
tort
claims
act
had
waved
the
liability
of
the
united
states
only
under
such
conditions
as
it
is
send
to
but
you
could
not
penalize
the
government
where
it
was
defendant
on
the
tort
claims
act,
but
in
the
civil
litigation,
in
the
criminal
prosecution
situation
were
the
same
question
arises
that
is
the
result
that
usually
reached.
that
is
the
government
is
penalized
as
a
litigant
because
it
does
not
supply
information
that
the
court
claims
is
relevant
and
the
government
then
has
the
option,
unlike
the
freedom
of
information
act
situation
of
losing
the
litigation
or
abandoning
it
and
preserving
a
secrecy
of
information
that
it
thinks
should
not
be
divulged
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
yes,
it's
mr.
justice
5,
it
may
require
part
two.
it's
an
exemption
from
all
the
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
if
i
might
clarify
--
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that's
right,
and
if
i
may
clarify
your
comment,
constitutional
questions
is
involved
here
only
in
the
sense
that
they
provide
a
backdrop
for
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
common
law
questions
are
involved
in
connection
with
exemption
5,
because
exemption
5
by
its
very
language
refers
to
whether
or
not
a
private
party
in
a
hypothetical
litigation
with
the
government
would
be
able
on
discovery
to
get
that
information
from
the
government.
the
rule
is
that
it
would
if
information
can
be
made
available.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
right.
i
did
not
see
fit
to
stress
or
reply
to
respondent's
argument
that
congressman
has
special
rights
under
this
act.
it
is
clear
that
they
do
not.
the
rights
of
the
act
extend
to
any
member
of
the
public.
the
language
in
paragraph
c
on
page
47
is
clearly
a
savings
clause.
it's
just
as
we
have
--
this
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
powers
of
congress
as
an
institution
to
compel
information
and
it
surely
is
a
somewhat
i
think
even
shocking
notion
that
an
individual
congressman
could
compel
information
either
from
the
government
or
from
other
private
citizens
just
on
his
own
say
so.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
that
is
right.
the
law
treats
all
equally.
mr.
roger
c.
cramton
no
the
congress
is
not
involved
in
any
institutional
capacity.
the
respondents
are
acting
in
their
individual
capacities
only
as
“any
persons
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.”
