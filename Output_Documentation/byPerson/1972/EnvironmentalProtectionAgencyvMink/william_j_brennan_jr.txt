justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
mr.
clark
that
perhaps,
this
whole
case
in
this
court
is
premature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
dismiss
this
as
improvidently
granted
that
would
leave
that
judgment
of
course
to
stand
undisturbed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
mr.
clark
one
of
the
key
is
here
is
in
section
3
anyway,
isn’t
it?
what
the
court
supposed
to
do
as
i
read
this,
is
order
the
production
of
any
agency
records
improperly
withheld
from
a
complainant
and
in
order
to
determine
whether
it's
improperly
withheld,
that
the
claim
is
it
falls
under
b
(1)
or
anyway
from
b
(1)
to
b
(9).
the
judges
have
got
to
decide
whether
the
particular
plaintiffs
satisfy
one
denying
and
if
they
say
do
not,
then
they
have
been
improperly
withheld,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
and
the
determination
of
whether
something
is
improperly
withheld,
i
guess,
is
this
what
the
next
sentence
means;
in
such
a
case,
the
court
shall
determine
the
matter
de
novo
and
the
burden
is
on
the
agency
to
sustain
its
status?
