mr.
ramsey
clark
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
fairness
to
the
court
below,
i
should
point
to
a
few
facts
that
primarily
showed
there
was
an
urgency
at
the
time
of
considerations
below
that
do
not
obtain
now
and
then
explain
the
posture
of
the
case.
i
say
that
particularly
in
connection
with
the
last
question.
actually,
the
court
of
appeals
begun
its
opinion,
in
its
opinion
with
the
observation
that
it
didn't
answer
all
the
questions
before
it.
it
was
dealing
with
a
motion
for
summary
reversal.
the
case
in
a
sense
began
with
a
newspaper
article.
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
the
court
to
consider
it
in
the
light
of
the
new
york
times
case,
because
it
is
closely
related.
you
may
recall
the
solicitor
general
in
the
new
york
times
argument
referring
to
the
fact
that
there
could
have
been
a
case
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
have
obtained
those
documents
and
in
a
sense
this
case
may
tell
us
whether
the
elseberg
way,
so
to
speak.
is
the
only
way
available
or
there
is
a
judicial
sanction
that
can
be
used
to
cause
a
disclosure
of
information.
on
july
26,
1971
there
was
an
article
in
the
washington
star
that
said
that
two
agencies,
the
department
of
defense
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
them
were
urging
the
going
forward
with
this
cannikin
amchitka
megaton
detonation
which
was
then
scheduled
for
october
that
year.
it
will
on
to
say
that
there
was
a
controversy
within
the
government
that
five
agencies
were
opposing
the
test
and
described
them
as
being
the
process
state
united
states
information
agency,
the
office
of
science
and
technology,
the
council
on
environmental
quality
and
the
environmental
protection
agency.
then
as
you
can
from
the
record
it
alluded
briefly
to
the
reasons
now.
now
when
that
came
forth
congressmen
who
were
particularly
concerned
about
the
test
and
primarily
people
from
hawaii
and
california,
because
there
had
been
earthquakes
from
seismic
action
in
the
allusion
chain
that
had
caused
deaths
and
great
damage
in
hawaii
and
in
california,
immediately
sought
to
determine
what
the
nature
of
these
reports
was,
what
facts
they
were
within
these
reports,
because
as
congress
women
and
men
they
had
two
actions
coming
up
before
them
in
the
immediate
future.
the
authorization
act
for
the
atomic
energy
commission
was
before
them
in
july
that
year
and
in
august
and
the
appropriations
act
for
that
agency
and
for
this
very
test.
now
it
was
in
that
urgent
context
that
this
went
before
the
court.
the
suit
was
filed
on
august
11th.
it
was
disposed
off
by
partial
dismissal
and
partial
summary
judgment
for
the
government
on
august
27th.
the
court
of
appeals
expedited
as
did
the
court
below
in
accordance
with
the
mandate
of
the
act
itself
and
the
situation
as
well
and
heard
arguments
in
the
late
september,
mid
the
late
september
and
decided
the
case
on
october
15.
now,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
it
began,
it's
summarily
reversed,
but
it
began
with
the
observation
that
after
considering
the
arguments
of
counsel
and
these
covered
the
entire
range
of
the
complaint
and
the
responses
in
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
that
both
the
parties
had
filed,
that
this
case
was
inappropriate
for
summary
disposition
and
that
it
was
not
going
to
summarily
dispose
of
the
case,
but
it
wanted
in
a
practical
way
to
give
some
guidance
to
the
district
courts
so
there
could
be
some
expedition
and
review
this
information
to
see
if
it
could
be
submitted
to
the
congress
before
the
test.
and
it
is
in
that
way
that
the
case
went
back
down
and
there
were
only
two
areas
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
summarily
disposed
of
the
issues
before
it.
first,
it
said
that
classification
by
association
is
erroneous.
now
all
it
had
before
it
was
the
irwin
affidavit.
all
it
knew
about
the
documents
was
what
was
said
in
the
irwin
affidavit.
when
you
look
at
the
irwin
affidavit,
you'll
see
that
one
document,
the
impact
statement
so
called
was
as
a
matter
of
law
publicly,
the
congress
required
that
it
be
published;
that
each
of
the
other
line
was
restricted
as
secret,
top
secret
or
under
the
atomic
energy
commission
as
restricted
data.
now
when
you
see
what
happened
in
a
parallel
case
with
these
very
documents,
it
is
now
argued
we
should
not
be
able
to
see
at
all.
you'll
find
that
they
have
been
reviewed.
three
were
partially
disclosed
in
a
collateral
case
of
these
very
documents
that
the
government
is
now
arguing
we
shouldn't
be
able
to
see,
were
disclosed
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
environmental
case,
the
nuclear
responsibility
case.
six
were
permitted,
as
i
say
permitted
in
the
sense
that
the
government
conceded
that
the
district
court
could
review
them,
here
it’s
in
camera.
here
it
says
that
shouldn't
happen.
august
6th,
that
were
reviewed
in
the
camera,
in
camera
the
six
of
these
ten.
five
were
specified
in
the
irwin
affidavit.
it
didn't
say
they
are
partially
classified,
they
are
top
secret;
it
said
they
are
classified
top
secret
or
secret
as
the
case
may
be,
yet
these
were
reviewed,
five
of
these.
two
were
internally
insofar
as
the
record
in
that
case,
which
is
before
the
court
shows,
were
entirely
classified
secret
or
top
secret
and
they
were
reviewed
by
the
court
below,
the
very
thing
that
is
not
permitted
here.
now
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
“if
there
is
matter
within
these
documents
that
can
be
separated
without
distorting
its
meaning,
if
it
is
not
so
inextricably
interwoven,
the
phrase
below,
that
it
can
be
separated,
do
it.
that's
what
it
directed
summarily
by
summary
disposition,
the
district
court
to
do.
and
it
said
that
if
it
is
necessary,
then
you
should
review
in
camera
to
determine
that
these
two
issues,
whether
or
not,
they
are
documents
attached
to
other
documents
and
classified
as
was
the
case
in
fact,
although
the
irwin
affidavit
did
not
so
and
classified
merely
by
association
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
it
never
had
that
concession
before
it,
that
has
been
made
here.
the
concession
was
made
in
footnote
4
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
here,
that
the
mere
attachment
of
an
unclassified
document
to
a
classified
document,
even
though
specified
in
10501
executive
order
to
permeate
to
the
document
so
attached
with
the
highest
classification
for
purposes
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
does
not
become
so
classified.
and
then
the
other
part
is
whether
there
are
components
within
a
single
document,
that
would
not
be
classified
and
that
is
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
and
it
has
asked
the
court
below
to
look
at
these
in
camera.
now
i
think
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
think
the
key
to
it
though
is
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
it
expressly
says
that
it
is
not
going
to
resolve
by
summary
disposition,
the
test
to
be
applied
under
exemption
number
one.
we
had
urged
to
the
district
court
that
the
test
be
the
test
that
president
eisenhower
and
and
president
kennedy
and
president
johnson
and
president
nixon
had
all
prescribed
for
executive
privilege
when
pled
before
the
congress
and
that
is
that
the
president
caused
an
independent
review
of
each
document
and
each
part
of
each
document
is
to
which
the
privilege
was
to
be
extended,
be
made
and
then
it
would
be
classified
on
that
basis.
the
government
roughly
below
said
--
that
there
is
no
power
in
the
court
to
review
it.
we
say
it
is
classified,
that's
it.
the
court
has
no
power
to
determine
whether
we
are
correct
or
not
or
whether
what
we
say
is
true.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
i
think
not,
i
think
when
it
said
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
think
first
the
act
clearly
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
court
to
enjoin
a
government
agency
from
refusing
to
disclose,
it
requires
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
as
a
general
proposition,
yeah.
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
there
are
nine
specific
exceptions.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
1
and
5
are
both
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
it
can
only
mean
one
thing
and
i
really
cannot
believe
that
the
government
would
content
otherwise.
it
only
means
that
this
section
does
not
require
or
give
the
power
to
the
courts
to
enjoin
disclosure
where
it
is
determined
by
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
one
of
these
exemptions
applies,
otherwise
the
act
has
no
meaning,
has
no
value.
all
the
court
ever
--
all
the
authority
ever
has
to
do
is
say
number
4,
it's
trade
secrets.
you
cannot
see
whether
it's
trade
secrets
or
not.
you
do
not
know
what
it
is,
you
have
to
take
their
word
for
the
veil
of
secrecy
and
the
executive
branch
falls
at
that
level
and
there
is
no
capacity,
no
power
in
the
judiciary
if
that
section
means
that
these
nine
areas
have
--
are
completely
exempted.
it
just
means
that
the
court
should
decide
and
if
it
decides
that
the
material
or
the
matter
as
it
says,
is
in
case
specifically
required
then
they
cannot
compel
disclosure,
but
the
court
must
decide,
not
the
executive.
mr.
ramsey
clark
there
were
--
there
are
several
things
that
should
be
said
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
not
necessarily
matters
does
not
mean
all
of
an
entire
document.
you
may
have
something,
the
thickness
of
a
telephone
book,
you
frequently
do
in
this
area
and
maybe
one
paragraph
in
a
whole
thing,
as
i
think
the
government
conceded,
clearly
this
could
not
mean
and
that's
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
pointed
out
and
the
only
reason
it
did
it
was
because
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
irwin
affidavit.
that
irwin
affidavit,
in
some
places
would
say
this
document
is
separately
classified
top
secret.
notice
it
would
merely
say
this
is
classified
top
secret.
from
that,
on
the
basis
of
our
knowledge
we
assumed
that
it
was
classified,
perhaps,
by
association
and
we
asked
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
face
that
issue
if
it
is
classified.
if
the
document
itself
is
not
classified
secret,
but
it
is
attached
to
one
that
is,
are
we
not
permitted
to
get
it
under
this
act
and
the
government
is
now
conceded
in
that
situation
that
we
are
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
really,
i
really
think
not.
i
think
even
if
that's
true
that
the
new
executive
order
11652,
which
by
the
way,
became
the
prevailing
along
this
area
two
days
after
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
was
granted
required
this
very
paragraph
by
paragraph
where
it
generally
contemplates
this
paragraph-by-paragraph
classification,
which
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
any
sense.
our
contention
below
has
been
that
even
10501
is
not
the
specific
requirement
that
was
contemplated
and
the
attorney
general’s
memo
that
was
promulgated
in
june
of
1967,
this
act
became
effective
on
the
4th
of
july,
which
is
an
appropriate
day
because
i
think
this
freedom
of
information
is
essential
to
freedom
in
a
democratic
society.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
i
do.
i
really
don't
think
this
issue
is
before
this
court
at
this
time
unless
it
wants
to
consider
matters
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
consider
because
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
says
“it
is
not
going
to
dispose
of
that
by
summary
disposition”
i
think
very
wisely
before
the
very
reasons
that
the
chief
justice
in
the
new
york
times
case
said
that
we
don't
have
the
facts.
let’s
get
the
facts
and
here
you
do
not
have
the
urgency
in
this
court
now
and
this
can
go
back
and
the
trial
court
can
look
at
it
and
it
can
make,
after
it
sees
these
document,
that
judgment.
now,
the
idea
that
courts
cannot
look
at
documents
classified
secret
is
beyond
my
comprehension
at
this
time.
i
thought
they
brought
47
volumes
into
this
court
and
into
the
courts
below
on
the
new
york
times
case.
we
have
seen
throughout
the
wiretap
area
that
the
solicitor
general
come
in
within
(inaudible)
taglianetti
and
other
cases
seeking
in
camera
inspection.
we
have
seen
the
same
thing
in
the
grand
jury
cases,
then
it's
the
us
where
they
seek
the
court
ex
parte
by
an
in-camera
proceeding
and
i
am
frank
enough
high
on
in-camera
proceedings,
but
that's
all
this
court
of
appeals
judgment
yields
us
at
this
time.
i
do
not
think
it
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
that
there
are
clearly
constitutional
issues
in
those
parts
of
the
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
declined
to
pass
on
by
a
way
of
summary
disposition.
i
think
that
appropriately
this
court
would
only
consider
the
statute
because
i
think
that,
that
is
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
did,
but
if
you
want
to
go
into
the
general
problems,
executive
privilege
and
that
has
not
been
raised
here,
it
has
not
been
thoroughly
briefed
and
i
think
in
this
administration
it
would
be
a
serious
mistake,
why
that
can't
be
done.
i
think
the
district
court
is
going
to
have
to
do
it.
i
think
it's
raised
by
the
pleadings,
but
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
had
before
the
motion
for
summary
reversal
wanted
to
get
this
thing
moving.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
blast
went
off
on
november
6th
and
at
that
time
we
had
not
been
able
to
obtain
the
information.
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
congress
there,
there
are
33
plaintiffs
here
do
a
congress,
women
and
men
could
have
done
anything
about
it.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
proper
judicial
administration,
that's
right.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
case
and
issues
at
the
court
of
appeals,
specifically
declined
to
pass
are
before
you
if
you
want
to
pass
on
them.
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
to
get
into
them.
i
think
that
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
“when
you
claim
an
exemption
under
1
or
5,
it
is
imperative
that
the
parts
that
can
be
severed
from
that
because
the
purpose
of
this
act
to
reveal
as
much
information
for
the
public
as
can
possibly
be
done.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
think
that
the
new
executive
order,
if
implemented
as
i
assume,
it
will
be,
will
narrow
the
range
of
review
that
the
court
will
have
to
make,
but
i
think
ultimately
that
when
it
comes
before
the
court,
it
comes
before
the
court
very
infrequently.
i
don't
believe
there
have
been
40
cases
at
this
time
that
it
raise
this
issue
and
when
the
government
pleads
exemption
for
matters
under
exemption
number
1
because
they
involve
military
or
diplomatic
secrets,
then
the
court
will
have
to
review
first
to
see
if
there
is
matter
combined
in
there
that
should
have
been
weaned
out
under
the
new
executive
order,
but
wasn't
and
second,
were
they
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
their
judgment.
now
that
issue
is
not
really
proper
before
this
court
at
this
time
because
of
the
nature
of
the
summary
disposition.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
am,
we
opposed
the
cert.
i
think
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
--
this
was
a
summary
disposition
and
we
opposed
it
as
being
something
that
--
we
didn't
get
all
the
--
we
wanted
below
either,
but
we
saw
in
our
reason
to
counter
petition
because
we
thought
our
opportunity,
it
was
still
viable
in
the
court
below.
so
yes
sir,
we
did
on
that
ground,
but
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted
at
this
time.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
entitled
to
an
affirmance,
i
think
what
is
done
here
is
very
minimal.
mr.
ramsey
clark
but
i
think
both
the
--
we
know
the
problems
in
judicial
administration
here
and
i
think
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
are
entitled
to
hear
review
on
what
--
i
don't
think
you
should
go,
it's
my
judgment
of
sound
judicial
administration
beyond
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
and
all
the
court
of
appeals
really
did
is
said
look
at
these
documents
and
where
there
are
documents,
first
if
they
were
severed
--
severable
sever
them
and
there
were
some,
but
the
court
of
appeals
never
got
to
see
them.
the
congressmen
never
got
to
see
them,
the
district
court
in
this
case
never
got
to
see
them.
they
were
severed
and
then
in
another
case,
they
came
out.
and
then
well
within
a
document,
there
is
material
that
severable
do
that.
now
that’s
precisely
what
the
judge
heart
did.
he
went
through
documents
in
the
nuclear
responsibility
case
that
were
both
classified
secret
or
top
secret
as
to
which
there
was
an
exemption
number
5,
the
decisional
processes
of
the
executive
branch
claim
and
he
extricated
some
and
disclosed
it,
required
its
disclosure
and
he
left
other
secret.
he
made
--
in
other
words,
he
performed
the
judicial
function
that
i
think
this
act
requires.
he
tried
to
matter
de
novo.
he
placed
the
burden
on
the
government
of
showing
the
exemption.
i
don’t
think
the
burden
on
the
government
means
any
kind
of
showing
the
exemption.
if
the
exemption
is
totally
excluded
by
the
side
of
the
executive
or
any
consideration
of
the
matter
before
them.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
at
the
very
least,
there
would
be
a
judicial
responsibility
to
look
and
see
if
this
is
just
a
medical
file
or
if
it
is
a
file
that
says
medical
on
it,
and
it's
got
all
the
kind
of
matter
in
it.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
that
is
absolutely
yes.
first,
not
just
because
we
have
an
advisory
system
and
that
really
relates
to
personal
privacy.
i
felt
very
strongly
about
that
exemption
when
the
act
came
in
but
second,
really
this
is
part
of
a
system
of
checks
and
balances,
that’s
what
the
statute
is
about.
mr.
ramsey
clark
by
the
very
nature
of
that,
we
haven't
to
that
--
this
section
is
not,
but
it
says
which
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
a
doctor
is
supposed
to
make
that
decision
or
a
judge
is
supposed
to
make
that
decision.
suppose
it
is
quite
important
to
a
plaintiff
in
a
case;
suppose
that
this
individual
as
to
whom
this
file
would
relate
has
done
something
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
(voice
overlap)
i
think
the
test
is
whether
it
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
and
i
think
that’s
a
judicial
test
to
be
made
under
the
act
by
the
judiciary.
i
don’t
think
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
it
has
meaning.
i
think
it
tells
you
exactly
the
material
that
the
court
cannot
compel
disclosure
of,
but
i
think
that
the
act
tells
you
that
the
courts
ought
to
determine
what
are
the
point
of
the
matter
in
question
is
that,
it
falls
under
one
of
those
exemptions.
i
think
if
that’s
not
true,
then
the
act
really
has
no
value
because
of
labeling
can
read
the
act
down
of
operation.
all
you
have
got
to
do,
all
the
executive
has
to
do
and
we're
talking
about
checks
and
balances
and
we
are
talking
about
something
that
congress
has
done
and
i
don't
know
another
area
where
the
congress
has
acted,
where
the
courts
have
not
performed
the
judicial
function
that’s
essential
in
that
situation.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
see
it
a
little
different.
i
think
i
don't
want
to
go
that
far
by
one
step,
simply
because
the
court
of
appeals
is
specifically
in
its
opinion
declined
to
make
that
adjudication
by
a
way
of
summary
disposition.
all
it
has
said
and
i
think
it
follows
necessarily
is
that
if
there
is
a
document
that
is
not
classified,
but
is
attached
to
another
document,
then
it
would,
i
suppose
you
could
say
inherently
be
incapable
of
having
been
specifically
designated.
somebody
may
have
slapped
the
face
of
a
poster
on,
but
if
the
act
wanted
for
disclosure
compatible
with
these
key
interests
here.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that’s
my
understanding
of
it,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
they
have
to
look
at
the
papers
to
do
that
very
frequently.
mr.
ramsey
clark
it's
the
only
meaning
that
i
can
read
out
of
it,
i
think
in
connection
with
justice
blackmun's
question
that
there
are
two
steps
to
number
one
but
i
don't
think
those
were
steps
were
considered
or
adjudicated
by
the
court
below
or
should
be
by
this
court,
but
i
think
first,
it
determines
whether
it
was
specifically
required
and
second,
whether
it
was
clearly
erroneous,
at
least
that
would
be
the
standard
that
i
proposed
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
feel
it
necessary
and
i
think
wisely
so
to
determine
that
test
at
that
time.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
think
the
analogy
here
would
be,
if
the
executive
came
in
and
said
here
is
the
statute
your
honor
and
cites
the
statute,
therefore
you
can’t
look
at
this
matter.
you
have
to
take
my
word
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
then
i
think
the
judge
would
have
to
look
and
see
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
file
or
the
military
records
or
medical
records
from
military
hospital.
i
don't
think
that
in
our
advisory
system
or
particularly
in
a
place
of
critical
checks
and
balances
that
we
have
here
because
obviously
if
you
can
put
a
stamp
on
these
things
and
preclude
judicial
review,
the
act
has
no
value
in
terms
of
checks
and
balances.
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
that
file
and
determine
in
its
work.
but
it's
the
function
that
is
imposed
upon
the
judiciary
by
this
act.
so
we
would
urge
affirmance.
thank
you.
mr.
ramsey
clark
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
fairness
to
the
court
below,
i
should
point
to
a
few
facts
that
primarily
showed
there
was
an
urgency
at
the
time
of
considerations
below
that
do
not
obtain
now
and
then
explain
the
posture
of
the
case.
i
say
that
particularly
in
connection
with
the
last
question.
actually,
the
court
of
appeals
begun
its
opinion,
in
its
opinion
with
the
observation
that
it
didn't
answer
all
the
questions
before
it.
it
was
dealing
with
a
motion
for
summary
reversal.
the
case
in
a
sense
began
with
a
newspaper
article.
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
the
court
to
consider
it
in
the
light
of
the
new
york
times
case,
because
it
is
closely
related.
you
may
recall
the
solicitor
general
in
the
new
york
times
argument
referring
to
the
fact
that
there
could
have
been
a
case
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
have
obtained
those
documents
and
in
a
sense
this
case
may
tell
us
whether
the
elseberg
way,
so
to
speak.
is
the
only
way
available
or
there
is
a
judicial
sanction
that
can
be
used
to
cause
a
disclosure
of
information.
on
july
26,
1971
there
was
an
article
in
the
washington
star
that
said
that
two
agencies,
the
department
of
defense
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
them
were
urging
the
going
forward
with
this
cannikin
amchitka
megaton
detonation
which
was
then
scheduled
for
october
that
year.
it
will
on
to
say
that
there
was
a
controversy
within
the
government
that
five
agencies
were
opposing
the
test
and
described
them
as
being
the
process
state
united
states
information
agency,
the
office
of
science
and
technology,
the
council
on
environmental
quality
and
the
environmental
protection
agency.
then
as
you
can
from
the
record
it
alluded
briefly
to
the
reasons
now.
now
when
that
came
forth
congressmen
who
were
particularly
concerned
about
the
test
and
primarily
people
from
hawaii
and
california,
because
there
had
been
earthquakes
from
seismic
action
in
the
allusion
chain
that
had
caused
deaths
and
great
damage
in
hawaii
and
in
california,
immediately
sought
to
determine
what
the
nature
of
these
reports
was,
what
facts
they
were
within
these
reports,
because
as
congress
women
and
men
they
had
two
actions
coming
up
before
them
in
the
immediate
future.
the
authorization
act
for
the
atomic
energy
commission
was
before
them
in
july
that
year
and
in
august
and
the
appropriations
act
for
that
agency
and
for
this
very
test.
now
it
was
in
that
urgent
context
that
this
went
before
the
court.
the
suit
was
filed
on
august
11th.
it
was
disposed
off
by
partial
dismissal
and
partial
summary
judgment
for
the
government
on
august
27th.
the
court
of
appeals
expedited
as
did
the
court
below
in
accordance
with
the
mandate
of
the
act
itself
and
the
situation
as
well
and
heard
arguments
in
the
late
september,
mid
the
late
september
and
decided
the
case
on
october
15.
now,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
it
began,
it's
summarily
reversed,
but
it
began
with
the
observation
that
after
considering
the
arguments
of
counsel
and
these
covered
the
entire
range
of
the
complaint
and
the
responses
in
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
that
both
the
parties
had
filed,
that
this
case
was
inappropriate
for
summary
disposition
and
that
it
was
not
going
to
summarily
dispose
of
the
case,
but
it
wanted
in
a
practical
way
to
give
some
guidance
to
the
district
courts
so
there
could
be
some
expedition
and
review
this
information
to
see
if
it
could
be
submitted
to
the
congress
before
the
test.
and
it
is
in
that
way
that
the
case
went
back
down
and
there
were
only
two
areas
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
summarily
disposed
of
the
issues
before
it.
first,
it
said
that
classification
by
association
is
erroneous.
now
all
it
had
before
it
was
the
irwin
affidavit.
all
it
knew
about
the
documents
was
what
was
said
in
the
irwin
affidavit.
when
you
look
at
the
irwin
affidavit,
you'll
see
that
one
document,
the
impact
statement
so
called
was
as
a
matter
of
law
publicly,
the
congress
required
that
it
be
published;
that
each
of
the
other
line
was
restricted
as
secret,
top
secret
or
under
the
atomic
energy
commission
as
restricted
data.
now
when
you
see
what
happened
in
a
parallel
case
with
these
very
documents,
it
is
now
argued
we
should
not
be
able
to
see
at
all.
you'll
find
that
they
have
been
reviewed.
three
were
partially
disclosed
in
a
collateral
case
of
these
very
documents
that
the
government
is
now
arguing
we
shouldn't
be
able
to
see,
were
disclosed
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
environmental
case,
the
nuclear
responsibility
case.
six
were
permitted,
as
i
say
permitted
in
the
sense
that
the
government
conceded
that
the
district
court
could
review
them,
here
it’s
in
camera.
here
it
says
that
shouldn't
happen.
august
6th,
that
were
reviewed
in
the
camera,
in
camera
the
six
of
these
ten.
five
were
specified
in
the
irwin
affidavit.
it
didn't
say
they
are
partially
classified,
they
are
top
secret;
it
said
they
are
classified
top
secret
or
secret
as
the
case
may
be,
yet
these
were
reviewed,
five
of
these.
two
were
internally
insofar
as
the
record
in
that
case,
which
is
before
the
court
shows,
were
entirely
classified
secret
or
top
secret
and
they
were
reviewed
by
the
court
below,
the
very
thing
that
is
not
permitted
here.
now
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
“if
there
is
matter
within
these
documents
that
can
be
separated
without
distorting
its
meaning,
if
it
is
not
so
inextricably
interwoven,
the
phrase
below,
that
it
can
be
separated,
do
it.
that's
what
it
directed
summarily
by
summary
disposition,
the
district
court
to
do.
and
it
said
that
if
it
is
necessary,
then
you
should
review
in
camera
to
determine
that
these
two
issues,
whether
or
not,
they
are
documents
attached
to
other
documents
and
classified
as
was
the
case
in
fact,
although
the
irwin
affidavit
did
not
so
and
classified
merely
by
association
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
it
never
had
that
concession
before
it,
that
has
been
made
here.
the
concession
was
made
in
footnote
4
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
here,
that
the
mere
attachment
of
an
unclassified
document
to
a
classified
document,
even
though
specified
in
10501
executive
order
to
permeate
to
the
document
so
attached
with
the
highest
classification
for
purposes
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
does
not
become
so
classified.
and
then
the
other
part
is
whether
there
are
components
within
a
single
document,
that
would
not
be
classified
and
that
is
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
and
it
has
asked
the
court
below
to
look
at
these
in
camera.
now
i
think
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
think
the
key
to
it
though
is
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
it
expressly
says
that
it
is
not
going
to
resolve
by
summary
disposition,
the
test
to
be
applied
under
exemption
number
one.
we
had
urged
to
the
district
court
that
the
test
be
the
test
that
president
eisenhower
and
and
president
kennedy
and
president
johnson
and
president
nixon
had
all
prescribed
for
executive
privilege
when
pled
before
the
congress
and
that
is
that
the
president
caused
an
independent
review
of
each
document
and
each
part
of
each
document
is
to
which
the
privilege
was
to
be
extended,
be
made
and
then
it
would
be
classified
on
that
basis.
the
government
roughly
below
said
--
that
there
is
no
power
in
the
court
to
review
it.
we
say
it
is
classified,
that's
it.
the
court
has
no
power
to
determine
whether
we
are
correct
or
not
or
whether
what
we
say
is
true.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
i
think
not,
i
think
when
it
said
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
think
first
the
act
clearly
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
court
to
enjoin
a
government
agency
from
refusing
to
disclose,
it
requires
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
as
a
general
proposition,
yeah.
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
there
are
nine
specific
exceptions.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
1
and
5
are
both
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
it
can
only
mean
one
thing
and
i
really
cannot
believe
that
the
government
would
content
otherwise.
it
only
means
that
this
section
does
not
require
or
give
the
power
to
the
courts
to
enjoin
disclosure
where
it
is
determined
by
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
one
of
these
exemptions
applies,
otherwise
the
act
has
no
meaning,
has
no
value.
all
the
court
ever
--
all
the
authority
ever
has
to
do
is
say
number
4,
it's
trade
secrets.
you
cannot
see
whether
it's
trade
secrets
or
not.
you
do
not
know
what
it
is,
you
have
to
take
their
word
for
the
veil
of
secrecy
and
the
executive
branch
falls
at
that
level
and
there
is
no
capacity,
no
power
in
the
judiciary
if
that
section
means
that
these
nine
areas
have
--
are
completely
exempted.
it
just
means
that
the
court
should
decide
and
if
it
decides
that
the
material
or
the
matter
as
it
says,
is
in
case
specifically
required
then
they
cannot
compel
disclosure,
but
the
court
must
decide,
not
the
executive.
mr.
ramsey
clark
there
were
--
there
are
several
things
that
should
be
said
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
not
necessarily
matters
does
not
mean
all
of
an
entire
document.
you
may
have
something,
the
thickness
of
a
telephone
book,
you
frequently
do
in
this
area
and
maybe
one
paragraph
in
a
whole
thing,
as
i
think
the
government
conceded,
clearly
this
could
not
mean
and
that's
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
pointed
out
and
the
only
reason
it
did
it
was
because
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
irwin
affidavit.
that
irwin
affidavit,
in
some
places
would
say
this
document
is
separately
classified
top
secret.
notice
it
would
merely
say
this
is
classified
top
secret.
from
that,
on
the
basis
of
our
knowledge
we
assumed
that
it
was
classified,
perhaps,
by
association
and
we
asked
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
face
that
issue
if
it
is
classified.
if
the
document
itself
is
not
classified
secret,
but
it
is
attached
to
one
that
is,
are
we
not
permitted
to
get
it
under
this
act
and
the
government
is
now
conceded
in
that
situation
that
we
are
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
really,
i
really
think
not.
i
think
even
if
that's
true
that
the
new
executive
order
11652,
which
by
the
way,
became
the
prevailing
along
this
area
two
days
after
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
was
granted
required
this
very
paragraph
by
paragraph
where
it
generally
contemplates
this
paragraph-by-paragraph
classification,
which
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
any
sense.
our
contention
below
has
been
that
even
10501
is
not
the
specific
requirement
that
was
contemplated
and
the
attorney
general’s
memo
that
was
promulgated
in
june
of
1967,
this
act
became
effective
on
the
4th
of
july,
which
is
an
appropriate
day
because
i
think
this
freedom
of
information
is
essential
to
freedom
in
a
democratic
society.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
i
do.
i
really
don't
think
this
issue
is
before
this
court
at
this
time
unless
it
wants
to
consider
matters
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
consider
because
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
says
“it
is
not
going
to
dispose
of
that
by
summary
disposition”
i
think
very
wisely
before
the
very
reasons
that
the
chief
justice
in
the
new
york
times
case
said
that
we
don't
have
the
facts.
let’s
get
the
facts
and
here
you
do
not
have
the
urgency
in
this
court
now
and
this
can
go
back
and
the
trial
court
can
look
at
it
and
it
can
make,
after
it
sees
these
document,
that
judgment.
now,
the
idea
that
courts
cannot
look
at
documents
classified
secret
is
beyond
my
comprehension
at
this
time.
i
thought
they
brought
47
volumes
into
this
court
and
into
the
courts
below
on
the
new
york
times
case.
we
have
seen
throughout
the
wiretap
area
that
the
solicitor
general
come
in
within
(inaudible)
taglianetti
and
other
cases
seeking
in
camera
inspection.
we
have
seen
the
same
thing
in
the
grand
jury
cases,
then
it's
the
us
where
they
seek
the
court
ex
parte
by
an
in-camera
proceeding
and
i
am
frank
enough
high
on
in-camera
proceedings,
but
that's
all
this
court
of
appeals
judgment
yields
us
at
this
time.
i
do
not
think
it
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
that
there
are
clearly
constitutional
issues
in
those
parts
of
the
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
declined
to
pass
on
by
a
way
of
summary
disposition.
i
think
that
appropriately
this
court
would
only
consider
the
statute
because
i
think
that,
that
is
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
did,
but
if
you
want
to
go
into
the
general
problems,
executive
privilege
and
that
has
not
been
raised
here,
it
has
not
been
thoroughly
briefed
and
i
think
in
this
administration
it
would
be
a
serious
mistake,
why
that
can't
be
done.
i
think
the
district
court
is
going
to
have
to
do
it.
i
think
it's
raised
by
the
pleadings,
but
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
had
before
the
motion
for
summary
reversal
wanted
to
get
this
thing
moving.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
blast
went
off
on
november
6th
and
at
that
time
we
had
not
been
able
to
obtain
the
information.
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
congress
there,
there
are
33
plaintiffs
here
do
a
congress,
women
and
men
could
have
done
anything
about
it.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
proper
judicial
administration,
that's
right.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
case
and
issues
at
the
court
of
appeals,
specifically
declined
to
pass
are
before
you
if
you
want
to
pass
on
them.
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
to
get
into
them.
i
think
that
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
“when
you
claim
an
exemption
under
1
or
5,
it
is
imperative
that
the
parts
that
can
be
severed
from
that
because
the
purpose
of
this
act
to
reveal
as
much
information
for
the
public
as
can
possibly
be
done.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
think
that
the
new
executive
order,
if
implemented
as
i
assume,
it
will
be,
will
narrow
the
range
of
review
that
the
court
will
have
to
make,
but
i
think
ultimately
that
when
it
comes
before
the
court,
it
comes
before
the
court
very
infrequently.
i
don't
believe
there
have
been
40
cases
at
this
time
that
it
raise
this
issue
and
when
the
government
pleads
exemption
for
matters
under
exemption
number
1
because
they
involve
military
or
diplomatic
secrets,
then
the
court
will
have
to
review
first
to
see
if
there
is
matter
combined
in
there
that
should
have
been
weaned
out
under
the
new
executive
order,
but
wasn't
and
second,
were
they
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
their
judgment.
now
that
issue
is
not
really
proper
before
this
court
at
this
time
because
of
the
nature
of
the
summary
disposition.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
am,
we
opposed
the
cert.
i
think
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
--
this
was
a
summary
disposition
and
we
opposed
it
as
being
something
that
--
we
didn't
get
all
the
--
we
wanted
below
either,
but
we
saw
in
our
reason
to
counter
petition
because
we
thought
our
opportunity,
it
was
still
viable
in
the
court
below.
so
yes
sir,
we
did
on
that
ground,
but
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted
at
this
time.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
entitled
to
an
affirmance,
i
think
what
is
done
here
is
very
minimal.
mr.
ramsey
clark
but
i
think
both
the
--
we
know
the
problems
in
judicial
administration
here
and
i
think
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
are
entitled
to
hear
review
on
what
--
i
don't
think
you
should
go,
it's
my
judgment
of
sound
judicial
administration
beyond
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
and
all
the
court
of
appeals
really
did
is
said
look
at
these
documents
and
where
there
are
documents,
first
if
they
were
severed
--
severable
sever
them
and
there
were
some,
but
the
court
of
appeals
never
got
to
see
them.
the
congressmen
never
got
to
see
them,
the
district
court
in
this
case
never
got
to
see
them.
they
were
severed
and
then
in
another
case,
they
came
out.
and
then
well
within
a
document,
there
is
material
that
severable
do
that.
now
that’s
precisely
what
the
judge
heart
did.
he
went
through
documents
in
the
nuclear
responsibility
case
that
were
both
classified
secret
or
top
secret
as
to
which
there
was
an
exemption
number
5,
the
decisional
processes
of
the
executive
branch
claim
and
he
extricated
some
and
disclosed
it,
required
its
disclosure
and
he
left
other
secret.
he
made
--
in
other
words,
he
performed
the
judicial
function
that
i
think
this
act
requires.
he
tried
to
matter
de
novo.
he
placed
the
burden
on
the
government
of
showing
the
exemption.
i
don’t
think
the
burden
on
the
government
means
any
kind
of
showing
the
exemption.
if
the
exemption
is
totally
excluded
by
the
side
of
the
executive
or
any
consideration
of
the
matter
before
them.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
at
the
very
least,
there
would
be
a
judicial
responsibility
to
look
and
see
if
this
is
just
a
medical
file
or
if
it
is
a
file
that
says
medical
on
it,
and
it's
got
all
the
kind
of
matter
in
it.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
that
is
absolutely
yes.
first,
not
just
because
we
have
an
advisory
system
and
that
really
relates
to
personal
privacy.
i
felt
very
strongly
about
that
exemption
when
the
act
came
in
but
second,
really
this
is
part
of
a
system
of
checks
and
balances,
that’s
what
the
statute
is
about.
mr.
ramsey
clark
by
the
very
nature
of
that,
we
haven't
to
that
--
this
section
is
not,
but
it
says
which
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
a
doctor
is
supposed
to
make
that
decision
or
a
judge
is
supposed
to
make
that
decision.
suppose
it
is
quite
important
to
a
plaintiff
in
a
case;
suppose
that
this
individual
as
to
whom
this
file
would
relate
has
done
something
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
(voice
overlap)
i
think
the
test
is
whether
it
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
and
i
think
that’s
a
judicial
test
to
be
made
under
the
act
by
the
judiciary.
i
don’t
think
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
it
has
meaning.
i
think
it
tells
you
exactly
the
material
that
the
court
cannot
compel
disclosure
of,
but
i
think
that
the
act
tells
you
that
the
courts
ought
to
determine
what
are
the
point
of
the
matter
in
question
is
that,
it
falls
under
one
of
those
exemptions.
i
think
if
that’s
not
true,
then
the
act
really
has
no
value
because
of
labeling
can
read
the
act
down
of
operation.
all
you
have
got
to
do,
all
the
executive
has
to
do
and
we're
talking
about
checks
and
balances
and
we
are
talking
about
something
that
congress
has
done
and
i
don't
know
another
area
where
the
congress
has
acted,
where
the
courts
have
not
performed
the
judicial
function
that’s
essential
in
that
situation.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
see
it
a
little
different.
i
think
i
don't
want
to
go
that
far
by
one
step,
simply
because
the
court
of
appeals
is
specifically
in
its
opinion
declined
to
make
that
adjudication
by
a
way
of
summary
disposition.
all
it
has
said
and
i
think
it
follows
necessarily
is
that
if
there
is
a
document
that
is
not
classified,
but
is
attached
to
another
document,
then
it
would,
i
suppose
you
could
say
inherently
be
incapable
of
having
been
specifically
designated.
somebody
may
have
slapped
the
face
of
a
poster
on,
but
if
the
act
wanted
for
disclosure
compatible
with
these
key
interests
here.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that’s
my
understanding
of
it,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
they
have
to
look
at
the
papers
to
do
that
very
frequently.
mr.
ramsey
clark
it's
the
only
meaning
that
i
can
read
out
of
it,
i
think
in
connection
with
justice
blackmun's
question
that
there
are
two
steps
to
number
one
but
i
don't
think
those
were
steps
were
considered
or
adjudicated
by
the
court
below
or
should
be
by
this
court,
but
i
think
first,
it
determines
whether
it
was
specifically
required
and
second,
whether
it
was
clearly
erroneous,
at
least
that
would
be
the
standard
that
i
proposed
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
feel
it
necessary
and
i
think
wisely
so
to
determine
that
test
at
that
time.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
think
the
analogy
here
would
be,
if
the
executive
came
in
and
said
here
is
the
statute
your
honor
and
cites
the
statute,
therefore
you
can’t
look
at
this
matter.
you
have
to
take
my
word
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ramsey
clark
then
i
think
the
judge
would
have
to
look
and
see
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
file
or
the
military
records
or
medical
records
from
military
hospital.
i
don't
think
that
in
our
advisory
system
or
particularly
in
a
place
of
critical
checks
and
balances
that
we
have
here
because
obviously
if
you
can
put
a
stamp
on
these
things
and
preclude
judicial
review,
the
act
has
no
value
in
terms
of
checks
and
balances.
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
that
file
and
determine
in
its
work.
but
it's
the
function
that
is
imposed
upon
the
judiciary
by
this
act.
so
we
would
urge
affirmance.
thank
you.
