justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
clark,
doesn't
this
get
us
right
back
to
the
questions
that
justice
stewart
has
been
asking?
you
referred
a
little
while
ago
to
before
of
having
to
do
a
trade
secrets
and
that
clearly
someone
has
to
determine
what
a
trade
secret
is
and
you
say
it
is
a
district
court.
b
(1)
speaks
of
specifically
required
by
executive
order
and
isn’t
that
just
as
far
as
the
court
has
to
determine
the
situation
whether
it
is
or
is
not
specifically
required.
i
think
this
is
justice
stewart
inquiry
of
you.
but
as
i
understand
it
you
want
to
go
one
step
further,
and
say
not
only
whether
it
were
specifically
required,
but
whether
it
was
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
or
foreign
policy.
you
want
to
go
into
that
lower
level,
lower
or
further
inquiry,
am
i
correct
in
--
