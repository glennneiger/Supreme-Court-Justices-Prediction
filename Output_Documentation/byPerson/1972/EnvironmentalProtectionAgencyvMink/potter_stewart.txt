justice

well
it
purports
to
me
the
criteria,
the
alleged
criteria
said
on

of
your

top
secret
as
(a)
secret

(b)

justice

confidential

justice
potter
stewart
what
significance
would
you
give
to
the
provisions
of
this
legislation
that
provide
for
a
de
novo
hearing
in
a
district
court
and
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
agency,
any
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
respect
to
this
when
you
say
ex
parte
affidavit,
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it
hasn't
said
anything
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
we
have
an
ex
parte
affidavit,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no
opportunity
for
our
a
court
to
determine
whether
not
to
even
this
was
stamped
secret
or
the
top
secret?
justice
potter
stewart
so
do
i
understand
then
that
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
with
respect
to
category
one,
this
language
just
we
should
be
wholly
be
disregarded
that
the
--?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
burden
is
not
on
the
government
agency
and
that
the
court
has
no
business
determining
the
matter
de
novo
despite
what
congress
has
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
normally
that's
not
the
way
a
court
operates
is
it,
to
take
x-
part
of
the
affidavit
to
say
that
is
the
end
of
it.
you
have
sustained
your
burden
of
proof
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
constitutional
issues
involved
here?
i
thought
this
is
purely
a
matter
of
statutory,
it
is
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
congress
apparently
did
think
the
district
courts
had
the
ability
to
do
it
because
it
said
in
such
a
case
the
court
shall
determine
no
matter
de
novo
and
the
burden
is
on
the
agency
to
sustain
its
action.
now
you
think
the
court
is
incapable,
maybe
we
might
think
it's
incapable,
but
congress
gave
that
function
to
the
district
courts?m
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
--?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
have
the
statute,
was
it
in
construing
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
--
that's
what
we
have
here
is
the
statutory
language,
and
what
does
it
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
does
this
language
mean
in
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
there
has
been
no
cross
examination
of
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
normally
that's
what
happens
in
a
district
court
and
there
is
no
indication
here
(voice
overlap)
which
it
has
a
more
limited
in
function?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
to
determine
whether
it
falls
within
1?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
--
general
cramton,
as
i
thought
in
advancement
in
this
case
and
we
were
faced
here
with
the
matter
of
construction
of
a
statute
and
only
that.
no
constitutional
questions
and
no
questions
of
evidence
law
or
federal
common
law,
but
just
for
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
in
that
connection
i
wonder
if
you
tell
me
the
word
section
on
page
46
of
your
brief,
does
section
mean
the
entire
freedom
of
information
act?
it's
a
little
confusing
to
me
where
it
says
and
i
following
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
whole
act?
justice
potter
stewart
section
means
the
entire
act?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
considered,
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
done
and
goes
certainly
considerably
beyond
the
language
of
the
exemption
and
be
one
it
is
not,
which
would
seem,
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
literal
words
that
the
court
should
limit
its
inquiry
to
determining
whether
these
matters
were
specifically
required
by
executive
order
to
be
kept
secret
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
or
foreign
policy.
will
that
be?
would
you
agree?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
accurately
read
the
executive.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that’s
what
the
language
seems
to
say,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
that
language,
what
are
the
limits
of
the
courts’
decision
and
that
was
my
question.
i
should
suppose
that
it
could
be
read
that
if
you
find
that
this
has
been
specifically
required
by
executive
order
be
kept
secret
in
the
interest
of
national
defense
or
foreign
policy,
that’s
the
end
of
the
court's
inquiry,
even
though
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that's
what
the
language
seems
on
its
face
to
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps,
the
government
has
conceded
more
than
it
needed
to
do
under
this
language?
i
suggest
that
the
way
this
is
worded,
that
it
could
be
well
argued
that
the
limits
of
the
court's
inquiry
with
respect
to
the
exemption
number
one
under
b
is
whether
or
not
it
has
in
fact
been
required
by
the
executive
to
be
kept
secret,
no
matter
if
it's
the
district
of
columbia
telephone
book?
justice
potter
stewart
what
regular
word
weigh
in
your
argument
as
i
understand
that
on
the
adverb
specifically,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
referred
this
on
constitutional
cases
with
you,
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
a
statute
enacted
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
there
are
no
constitutional
issues
here
at
all,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
am
not
wrong,
as
i
understand
what
you
have
said

this
is
