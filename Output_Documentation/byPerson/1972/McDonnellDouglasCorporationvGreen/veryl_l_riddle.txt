mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
to
review
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit.
the
plaintiff
below
who
is
the
respondent
here,
mr.
percy
green
a
black
man,
and
the
defendant
below
who
is
the
petitioner
here
is
the
mcdonnell
douglas
corporation.
we’ll
refer
to
the
parties
to
this
suit
by
their
names
mr.
green
and
by
mcdonnell
during
the
course
of
the
argument
to
the
court.
mr.
green
was
a
mechanic
and
had
worked
at
mcdonnell
douglass
for
1966,
up
until
the
time
of
his
layoff
in
1964.
during
that
period
of
time,
he
had
established
a
work
record
that
qualified
him
by
the
rating
records
and
the
supervisors
at
the
plant
as
being
of
average,
or
suppose
said
another
way,
satisfactory.
he
was
in
that
period
of
time,
well
up
until
1963.
he
was
a
member
of
the
union
and
is
such
was
protected
by
the
union
rights
as
it
had
bargained
with
the
company
for
such
as
seniority
and
what
have
you.
however
in
1962,
the
respondent
here
mr.
green,
became
interested
in
doing
some
work
outside
of
the
work
that
he
had
been
doing
and
made
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
transferred
over
to
the
electronics
division
of
mcdonnell.
at
that
time
he
was
told
by
supervisors
and
by
people
with
whom
he
worked
that
for
him
to
transfer
over
to
that
division
would
cause
him
to
give
up
what
seniority
rights
and
whatever
protection
he
had
under
the
labor
contract.
and
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
that
that
new
department
that
he
was
looking
at
was
engaged
in
work
related
to
the
gemini
program
and
it
could
be
a
one
shot
contract,
because
of
that
there
was
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
durability
of
it.
well,
considering
those
factors,
1962
mr.
green
declined
to
transfer
and
didn’t
make
an
application.
a
few
months
later
the
next
year,
mr.
green
again
looked
over
at
the
other
department
and
decided
that
maybe
he
should
transfer.
the
pay
wasn’t
significantly
greater,
but
apparently
it
was
a
more
prestigious
position
and
would
utilize
his
skills
to
a
greater
extent.
when
he
looked
at
it
the
second
time,
he
was
again
advised
that
“because
you’re
a
member
of
the
union
now,
you
have
a
certain
seniority
rights,
but
and
again
this
is
the
gemini
program
and
you
may
--
when
you
get
over
there
as
a
non-union
member
or
employee
of
mcdonnell,
you
won’t
have
the
security
of
the
job
that
you
have
now.”
well,
in
spite
of
that
he
decided
to
make
the
transfer
and
for
approximately
a
year
thereafter.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
it
was
at
1963.
for
approximately
a
year
thereafter,
he
worked
there
as
a
technician
over
in
the
electronics
division
working
on
simulators
for
the
gemini
program.
well,
as
was
predicted
by
some,
the
program
was
winding
down
and
there
was
a
layoff
coming
up.
the
company
using
a
pattern,
or
using
a
practice
in
this
particular
essence
that
they
had
used
before
called
the
“totem
pole”
referred
to
in
the
case,
made
a
determination
that
some
of
the
excess
technicians
working
on
that
program
would
have
to
be
dismissed,
and
of
course
--
due
course
of
time,
mr.
green
and
14
to
15
others
in
fact
were
dismissed
or
laid
off.
at
the
time
that
they
were
laid
off,
the
time
that
mr.
green
was
laid
off,
he
made
some
protest
to
his
superiors
and
to
some
of
the
executives
of
mcdonnell
and
pointed
out
that
in
his
opinion
he
was
being
discriminated
because
he
was
a
black
man,
and
because
he
was
a
known
protestor
and
leader
in
civil
rights
activities
around
town.
pointed
out
that
his
position
in
those
activities
was
such
that
the
company
would
be
taking
some
risk
if
they
laid
him
off,
but
in
spite
of
the
various
and
prolonged
discussions,
he
was
laid
off.
now,
sometime
after
within
a
few
weeks
and
in
fact
in
october
1964,
mr.
green
participated
and
was
referred
to
in
the
record
and
in
the
briefs
as
a
“stall-in”
now
this
“stall-in”
as
was
referred
to
by
some
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case
as
an
attempt
to
sabotage
the
facility
and
the
operations
of
mcdonnell.
i
think
to
fully
understand
the
significance
and
the
impact
of
the
other
“stall-in”
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
pages
57,
58
and
59
of
the
volume
one
of
the
appendix.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
it’s
on
the
volume
1
of
the
appendix
and
at
page
507,
508
and
509.
it’s
the
last
two
or
three
pages
in
the
--
in
that
volume.
now
look
at
the
plan
that
was
devised
by
mr.
green
and
others.
one
could
readily
see
that
this
wasn’t
a
carelessly
planned
program.
it
was
designed
carefully
and
for
the
purpose
of
totally
disrupting
the
flow
of
traffic
to
and
from
the
plant
facilities
of
mcdonnell
which
are
located
on
and
near
the
airport,
lambert
field
in
st.
louis.
the
plan
being
to
park
cars
on
roads
that
led
to
the
excess
and
roads
that
led
away
during
a
shift
change
where
something
between
10
and
1500
people
are
going
to
be
going
to
and
from
on
limited
access,
and
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
a
football
field
where
the
roads
coming
into
small
directions.
this
is
a
case
where
there’s
an
airport
and
the
access
roads
are
much
more
limited
than
in
the
typical
installation.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
yes,
it
is.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
it’s
right
near
the
runways
and
in
fact,
the
manufacturing
facilities
are
principally
on
the
runway
itself,
or
on
the
airport
itself.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
yes.
so
as
a
result
of
this
activity,
the
participants
in
fact
drove
their
cars
and
parked
them
at
strategically
located
positions.
and
at
that
time
as
the
plan
called
for,
they
locked
their
doors.
they
put
their
brakes
on.
they
shut
their
motor
off,
and
planned
to
stay
there
in
that
position
for
at
least
one
hour.
and
they
were
instructed
to
stay
there
and
resist
being
taken
away
unless
the
officers
made
certain
explanations
to
them
as
to
why
they
should
leave.
now,
the
impact
of
a
complete
“stall-in”
or
a
blockage
of
traffic
at
that
time
and
under
those
conditions
could
have
and
except
for
alert
police
activity,
could
have
been
catastrophic
and
could
have
destroyed
an
entire
shift
operation
at
the
plant.
and
the
amount
of
money
and
the
amount
of
property
potentially
subject
to
destruction
or
damage
as
result
to
this
is
very,
very
substantial.
now,
following
that
program,
mr.
green
was
arrested
and
pay
the
fine,
found
guilty.
and
sometime
thereafter,
i
believe
it
was
july
the
2nd
of
1965,
mr.
green
had
continued
in
his
activities,
some
of
with
were
lawful
and
some
of
them
which
were
unlawful.
and
at
that
time
his
group
action
locked
the
gates
doors
at
a
building
that
housed
mcdonnell
douglas
personnel
downtown.
at
a
time
when
the
employees
were
attempting
to
leave
the
building,
effect
to
this
was
to
temporarily
imprison
the
occupants
of
the
building
during
a
period
of
time
that
they
would’ve
been
leaving.
and
then
on
july
the
22nd,
just
a
few
days
after
the
lock-in
at
the
roberts
building
downtown,
mr.
green
applied
for
a
job
as
a
mechanic
at
mcdonnell
douglas.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
later
record
indicates
that
he
was
employed
of
and
on,
but
i
don’t
believe
the
employment
was
steady
or
with
one
employer
throughout
that
period
of
time.
of
course
when
he
made
this
application
the
reaction
from
the
people
at
mcdonnell
was
predictable.
they
said
“no,
we
will
not
be
able
to
use
you.”
following
that,
he
filed
his
complaint
with
the
eeoc.
eeoc
made
its
investigation
and
made
its
report.
they
found
that
there
was
reasonable
basis
for
mr.
green
to
bring
a
lawsuit
and
he
filed
one
at
that
time
under
section
704
of
the
act.
case
come
on
for
trial,
well
after
a
period
of
time
had
passed,
mr.
green
filed
his
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
missouri.
it
came
on
for
trial
before
chief
justice
--
chief
judge
meredith
there
and
it
was
tried
for
about
four
days.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
or
before
the
trial
actually
begun,
green
made
an
effort
to
amend
his
petition
to
include
raise
or
cause
of
action
under
703
in
addition
to
704
and
that
was
denied
by
the
court.
the
case
went
to
trial
under
704,
but
during
the
course
of
the
trial
green
attempted
to
interject
1981
civil
rights
act
as
a
basis
for
his
discussion
in
the
trial
of
the
issues
involving
race.
at
the
close
of
that
case,
judge
meredith
made
some
findings,
one
of
which
was
that
the
evidence
shows
that
plaintiff’s
civil
rights
activities
were
not
considered
as
a
factor
and
the
decision
to
layoff
the
plaintiff.
and
then
he
made
these
findings,
and
i
think
it’s
important
for
the
court
to
carefully
consider
just
what
was
before
judge
meredith
and
what
it
was
that
he
found.
he
says
“the
plaintiff
contends
the
defendant
violated
7043
because
of
his
opposition
to
employment
practices.
plaintiff
also
contends
in
his
post
trial
brief
the
defendant’s
refusal
to
hire
him
was
based
on
race
and
his
participation
in
civil
rights
activities,
violation
of
1981
and
this
important
to
conclusion
and
finding
by
the
court.
the
court
feels
that
the
court’s
discussion
of
the
case
under
704
will
effectively
dispose
of
any
claim
arising
under
section
1981.”
and
these
are
the
controlling
standards
that
judge
meredith
applied
in
reaching
his
decision.
he
says
this,
“the
matter
before
the
court’s
controlling
an
ultimate
fact
the
questions
are
whether
the
plaintiff’s
misconduct
is
sufficient
to
justify
defendant’s
refusal
to
rehire,
and
two,
whether
the
‘stall-in’
and
‘lock-in’
are
the
real
reasons
for
defendant’s
refusal
to
rehire
the
plaintiff.”
the
court
finds
that
they
are.
then
the
trial
court
proceeded
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
there
mr.
green
had
failed
to
establish
by
the
greater
way
to
preponderance
that
the
defendant’s
refusal
to
rehire
plaintiff
resulted
from
racial
prejudice
or
plaintiff’s
legitimate
civil
rights
activities.
it
seems
clear
from
the
record
and
then
again
quoting
this
are,
“that
the
defendant’s
reasons
for
refusing
to
rehire
the
plaintiff
were
motivated
solely
and
simply
by
the
plaintiff’s
participation
in
the
stall-in
and
the
lock-in.’
the
burden
of
proving
other
reasons
was
on
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
case
was
appealed
and
went
to
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
under
703.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
but
the
conclusion
of
the
court
there,
your
honor
was,
plaintiff
has
not
shown
the
defendant
was
motivated
by
racial
prejudice
or
because
of
the
plaintiff’s
legitimate
civil
rights
activities.
he
made
the
joint
finding.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
it
was
tried
and
it
was
tried
fairly.
and
four
days
of
trial
and
a
careful
reading
of
the
transcript
will
indicate
that
at
least
80%
of
all
subjects
inquired
about
and
all
questions
do
relate
to
the
question
of
race.
and
i
think
that
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
trial
judge,
the
district
judge
felt
that
under
the
contentions
being
made,
that
he
could
dispose
of
that
issue
in
this
case
and
did
dispose
of
it.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
if
the
lawsuit
had
been
tried
consistent
with
what
that
ruling
striking
race,
if
it
been
tried
consistent
with
that
theory,
yes
i
don’t
think
there’d
be
any
validity
in
our
position
at
all,
but
in
fact
it
wasn’t.
it
was
tried
thoroughly
and
this
was
the
feeling
of
one
member
of
the
panel
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
panel
is
shared
by
four
members
of
that
court.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
position
to
that
your
honor
is
this,
that
there
was
adequate
discovery
and
there
was
enough
discovery
here
to
allow
that
issue
to
be
tried.
there
were
discovery
opportunities
available
to
the
plaintiff’s
counsel
that
he
didn’t
avail
himself
of.
and
voluminous
records
were
in
fact
to
made
him
available
to
any
many
use
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
we
think
that
the
ruling
made
in
the
pretrial
as
to
the
extent
of
the
discovery
was
based
upon
the
unreasonableness
and
burdensomeness
of
it.
it
then
required
for
tons
in
thousands
and
thousands
of
documents
that
were
acquired
weeks
and
weeks
just
to
prepare
all
on
issue
that
doesn’t
seem
to
be
irrelevant
to
of
any
issues
that
the
case
presented.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
looked
at
the
decisions
below
and
affirmed
it
in
every
respect
except
it
sent
it
back
for
a
retrial
on
the
racial
discrimination
issue.
now,
if
the
court
had
stopped
there
and
used
the
basis
raised
by
his
honor
that
it
had
been
stricken
and
so
maybe
he
didn’t
had
his
full
day
in
court
and
going
back
and
try
it
again.
if
it
stopped
there,
the
case
wouldn’t
be
here
today,
but
the
court
did
some
very
significant
additions
to
adjust
that.
it
said
“one,
that
the
prima
facie
case
is
made
when
the
applicant
here,
a
black
man”
--
i
think
i
should
read
that
exactly
as
it
is
from
out
of
the
court’s
opinion.
“when
a
black
man
demonstrates
that
he
possesses
the
qualifications
to
fill
a
job
opening
and
that
he
was
denied
the
job
which
continues
to
remain
open,
we
think
he
present
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination.”
now
what
that
does
is
to
reverse
at
the
point
when
judge
meredith
says
it
was
up
to
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
to
establish
that
his
discharge
or
his
--
the
refusal
to
reinstate
him
was
based
upon
his
race
that
this
was
a
burden
that
the
petitioner
or
that
the
plaintiff
had
in
the
lower
court.
the
eighth
circuit
is
saying
that
he
merely
makes
that
prima
facie
showing
and
then
the
burden
is
upon
the
company
of
mcdonnell
here
to
establish
that
it
was
not
racially
motivated.
now,
in
addition
to
that
the
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof,
i
might
say
at
this
juncture
that
congress
in
considering
this
one
of
the
floor
managers,
we’ve
cited
that
in
our
brief.
one
of
the
floor
managers
carefully
explained
to
members
of
congress
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
these
cases
under
title
vii
will
be
as
it
has
always
been
that
the
burden
will
always
be
on
the
plaintiff,
the
person
bringing
the
lawsuit
and
it
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
this
was
what
congress
intended.
here,
the
eighth
circuit
by
its
opinion
is
shifting
that
burden
of
proof,
but
that’s
not
all
it
did.
second
off,
it
said
that
subjective
elements
from
the
employer,
in
this
case
from
mcdonnell
would
be
given
little
weight
or
its
weight
would
be
limited.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
and
i
might
say
further
to
that
the
third
thing
it
said
was
that
somehow
mcdonnell
would
have
to
establish
or
show
that
under
these
circumstances
its
refusal
to
rehire
green
was
related
to
job
performance,
while
limiting
the
value
or
the
weight
of
subjective
evidence
as
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
did.
test
the
other
imposition
had
plus
the
burden
of
weight
shift
caused
one
member
of
the
eighth
circuit
to
think
that
the
effect
of
this
opinion
would
be
to
order
mcdonnell
to
reinstate
or
rehire
green.
and
the
view
apparently
was
shared
by
four
members
of
the
court.
i
think
it’s
clear
when
the
employer
here
is
inhibited
by
testifying
as
to
his
reasons,
subjective
reasons
for
making
employment
decisions
that
when
that
is
being
told
or
when
the
eighth
circuit
is
telling
the
district
court
that
“you’re
to
give
very
little
weight
to
that”
that
we
think
that
that
means
practically
that
once
the
plaintiff
green
here
would
make
this
prima
facie
case
that
we
couldn’t
rebut
that
prima
facie
case
then
by
showing
that
our
refusal
to
employ
him
was
because
he
attempted
to
sabotage
our
plant,
or
locked
some
of
our
employees
into
the
office
building
downtown.
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
is
saying
that
this
is
to
be
given
very
little
weight
and
it
probably
will
not
justify
your
actions
in
refusing
to
employ.
now
there
seems
to
be
no
question
to
what
unlawful
activity
of
any
person
would
be
adequate
justification
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
hire.
and
i
think
that
would
be
true
whether
the
applicant
is
white,
whether
he
is
an
indian
or
whether
he
is
black,
or
whether
he
is
a
baptist
or
a
jew,
or
catholic.
i
think
that
that
is
clear
and
i
think
the
effect
of
this
opinion,
if
it’s
applied
literally,
will
cause
a
preempt
reversal
discrimination.
for
example,
i
don’t
think
it
could
be
seriously
questioned
that
if
a
white
man
were
to
throw
a
rock
in
the
chairman
of
mcdonnell’s
window
last
night
and
he
called
me
this
morning
and
says
“can
i
discharge
the
man?”
i
would
say
“yes.”
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
yes,
and
if
a
black
man
were
to
throw,
by
this
opinion
is
it’s
been
interpreted
and
as
we
interpret
a
rock
through
his
window,
yes
if
i
could
--
he
could
discharge
him,
i
would
have
to
say
following
the
mandate
of
this
opinion
we’ll
have
to
look
to
see
how
this
might
adversely
influenced
his
ability
to
perform
a
job.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
still
put
him
in
jail.
but
got
out
of
jail,
if
we
had
to
look
at
job
performance,
then
we
could
very
well
be
in
position
of
having
to
get
into
that
before
i
could
be
at
ease
and
say
“no,
you
can’t
discharge
him.”
i
use
that
as
an
illustration
of
how
--
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
i
think
the
rule
would
be
the
same,
your
honor.
i
think
it
applies
to
not
only
to
discharge,
i
think
it
would
apply
to
promotion
and
i
think
it
would
apply
to
job
applicants.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
what
remaining
time
i
have
i’d
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
mr.
chief
justice,
i’m
pained
to
have
to
correct
my
brother
counsel
here
on
the
f15
contract
which
he
mentioned
to
the
court
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
not
on
the
record.
the
fact
of
the
matter
that
contract
has
been
awarded
to
mcdonnell
douglas,
and
all
orders
made
with
respect
to
equal
opportunity
employment
had
been
complied
by
and
conformance
with
the
executive
orders
for
quite
sometime.
i’m
pained
to
have
to
deny
that
off
the
record
comment.
i
would
say
in
closing
to
this
court
that
this
law
title
vii
has
been
tremendously
beneficial
in
achieving
the
objectives
identified
by
congress.
and
a
lot
of
lawsuits
had
been
filed
at
the
district
courts
throughout
the
country
and
the
act
has,
i
think,
been
a
success,
remarkable
success.
this
case
particularly
case
as
result
of
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
has
created
a
lot
of
questions
and
has
caused
a
lot
of
concern
by
members
of
the
bar,
by
district
courts
and
by
employers
and
employees
as
well.
i
think
that
the
cause
of
the
complete
reversal
of
the
traditional
principles
that
involve
in
trying
this
issue,
were
the
only
issue
ever
to
determine
the
real
reason
why
a
person
is
refused
employment,
discharged
from
employment,
or
other
action
or
relations
that
he
has
with
his
employer.
and
to
get
at
the
real
issue
in
the
traditional
sense,
courts
have
done
a
good
job
and
they’ll
continue
to
do
a
good
job.
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
at
all,
nothing
in
the
law.
there
is
just
nothing
at
all
in
the
decisions
in
the
past
where
you
have
a
one
on
one,
an
individual
employer
or
an
individual
applicant
to
make
an
application
for
a
job.
and
this
decision,
if
it’s
followed
and
conscientious
district
courts
are
going
to
try
to
follow
it.
for
them
to
try
this,
the
law
be
turned
on
its
head.
and
i
submit
for
those
reasons
that
the
case
certainly
should
be
reversed,
and
we
think
it
ought
to
go
back,
with
an
order
from
this
court
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
who
heard
the
evidence
and
who
concluded
that
this
sort
of
unlawful
conduct
was
not
protected
and
it
would
form
an
abundant
basis
for
refusal
to
employ
any
person.
thank
you.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
to
review
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit.
the
plaintiff
below
who
is
the
respondent
here,
mr.
percy
green
a
black
man,
and
the
defendant
below
who
is
the
petitioner
here
is
the
mcdonnell
douglas
corporation.
we’ll
refer
to
the
parties
to
this
suit
by
their
names
mr.
green
and
by
mcdonnell
during
the
course
of
the
argument
to
the
court.
mr.
green
was
a
mechanic
and
had
worked
at
mcdonnell
douglass
for
1966,
up
until
the
time
of
his
layoff
in
1964.
during
that
period
of
time,
he
had
established
a
work
record
that
qualified
him
by
the
rating
records
and
the
supervisors
at
the
plant
as
being
of
average,
or
suppose
said
another
way,
satisfactory.
he
was
in
that
period
of
time,
well
up
until
1963.
he
was
a
member
of
the
union
and
is
such
was
protected
by
the
union
rights
as
it
had
bargained
with
the
company
for
such
as
seniority
and
what
have
you.
however
in
1962,
the
respondent
here
mr.
green,
became
interested
in
doing
some
work
outside
of
the
work
that
he
had
been
doing
and
made
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
transferred
over
to
the
electronics
division
of
mcdonnell.
at
that
time
he
was
told
by
supervisors
and
by
people
with
whom
he
worked
that
for
him
to
transfer
over
to
that
division
would
cause
him
to
give
up
what
seniority
rights
and
whatever
protection
he
had
under
the
labor
contract.
and
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
that
that
new
department
that
he
was
looking
at
was
engaged
in
work
related
to
the
gemini
program
and
it
could
be
a
one
shot
contract,
because
of
that
there
was
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
durability
of
it.
well,
considering
those
factors,
1962
mr.
green
declined
to
transfer
and
didn’t
make
an
application.
a
few
months
later
the
next
year,
mr.
green
again
looked
over
at
the
other
department
and
decided
that
maybe
he
should
transfer.
the
pay
wasn’t
significantly
greater,
but
apparently
it
was
a
more
prestigious
position
and
would
utilize
his
skills
to
a
greater
extent.
when
he
looked
at
it
the
second
time,
he
was
again
advised
that
“because
you’re
a
member
of
the
union
now,
you
have
a
certain
seniority
rights,
but
and
again
this
is
the
gemini
program
and
you
may
--
when
you
get
over
there
as
a
non-union
member
or
employee
of
mcdonnell,
you
won’t
have
the
security
of
the
job
that
you
have
now.”
well,
in
spite
of
that
he
decided
to
make
the
transfer
and
for
approximately
a
year
thereafter.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
it
was
at
1963.
for
approximately
a
year
thereafter,
he
worked
there
as
a
technician
over
in
the
electronics
division
working
on
simulators
for
the
gemini
program.
well,
as
was
predicted
by
some,
the
program
was
winding
down
and
there
was
a
layoff
coming
up.
the
company
using
a
pattern,
or
using
a
practice
in
this
particular
essence
that
they
had
used
before
called
the
“totem
pole”
referred
to
in
the
case,
made
a
determination
that
some
of
the
excess
technicians
working
on
that
program
would
have
to
be
dismissed,
and
of
course
--
due
course
of
time,
mr.
green
and
14
to
15
others
in
fact
were
dismissed
or
laid
off.
at
the
time
that
they
were
laid
off,
the
time
that
mr.
green
was
laid
off,
he
made
some
protest
to
his
superiors
and
to
some
of
the
executives
of
mcdonnell
and
pointed
out
that
in
his
opinion
he
was
being
discriminated
because
he
was
a
black
man,
and
because
he
was
a
known
protestor
and
leader
in
civil
rights
activities
around
town.
pointed
out
that
his
position
in
those
activities
was
such
that
the
company
would
be
taking
some
risk
if
they
laid
him
off,
but
in
spite
of
the
various
and
prolonged
discussions,
he
was
laid
off.
now,
sometime
after
within
a
few
weeks
and
in
fact
in
october
1964,
mr.
green
participated
and
was
referred
to
in
the
record
and
in
the
briefs
as
a
“stall-in”
now
this
“stall-in”
as
was
referred
to
by
some
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case
as
an
attempt
to
sabotage
the
facility
and
the
operations
of
mcdonnell.
i
think
to
fully
understand
the
significance
and
the
impact
of
the
other
“stall-in”
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
pages
57,
58
and
59
of
the
volume
one
of
the
appendix.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
it’s
on
the
volume
1
of
the
appendix
and
at
page
507,
508
and
509.
it’s
the
last
two
or
three
pages
in
the
--
in
that
volume.
now
look
at
the
plan
that
was
devised
by
mr.
green
and
others.
one
could
readily
see
that
this
wasn’t
a
carelessly
planned
program.
it
was
designed
carefully
and
for
the
purpose
of
totally
disrupting
the
flow
of
traffic
to
and
from
the
plant
facilities
of
mcdonnell
which
are
located
on
and
near
the
airport,
lambert
field
in
st.
louis.
the
plan
being
to
park
cars
on
roads
that
led
to
the
excess
and
roads
that
led
away
during
a
shift
change
where
something
between
10
and
1500
people
are
going
to
be
going
to
and
from
on
limited
access,
and
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
a
football
field
where
the
roads
coming
into
small
directions.
this
is
a
case
where
there’s
an
airport
and
the
access
roads
are
much
more
limited
than
in
the
typical
installation.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
yes,
it
is.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
it’s
right
near
the
runways
and
in
fact,
the
manufacturing
facilities
are
principally
on
the
runway
itself,
or
on
the
airport
itself.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
yes.
so
as
a
result
of
this
activity,
the
participants
in
fact
drove
their
cars
and
parked
them
at
strategically
located
positions.
and
at
that
time
as
the
plan
called
for,
they
locked
their
doors.
they
put
their
brakes
on.
they
shut
their
motor
off,
and
planned
to
stay
there
in
that
position
for
at
least
one
hour.
and
they
were
instructed
to
stay
there
and
resist
being
taken
away
unless
the
officers
made
certain
explanations
to
them
as
to
why
they
should
leave.
now,
the
impact
of
a
complete
“stall-in”
or
a
blockage
of
traffic
at
that
time
and
under
those
conditions
could
have
and
except
for
alert
police
activity,
could
have
been
catastrophic
and
could
have
destroyed
an
entire
shift
operation
at
the
plant.
and
the
amount
of
money
and
the
amount
of
property
potentially
subject
to
destruction
or
damage
as
result
to
this
is
very,
very
substantial.
now,
following
that
program,
mr.
green
was
arrested
and
pay
the
fine,
found
guilty.
and
sometime
thereafter,
i
believe
it
was
july
the
2nd
of
1965,
mr.
green
had
continued
in
his
activities,
some
of
with
were
lawful
and
some
of
them
which
were
unlawful.
and
at
that
time
his
group
action
locked
the
gates
doors
at
a
building
that
housed
mcdonnell
douglas
personnel
downtown.
at
a
time
when
the
employees
were
attempting
to
leave
the
building,
effect
to
this
was
to
temporarily
imprison
the
occupants
of
the
building
during
a
period
of
time
that
they
would’ve
been
leaving.
and
then
on
july
the
22nd,
just
a
few
days
after
the
lock-in
at
the
roberts
building
downtown,
mr.
green
applied
for
a
job
as
a
mechanic
at
mcdonnell
douglas.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
later
record
indicates
that
he
was
employed
of
and
on,
but
i
don’t
believe
the
employment
was
steady
or
with
one
employer
throughout
that
period
of
time.
of
course
when
he
made
this
application
the
reaction
from
the
people
at
mcdonnell
was
predictable.
they
said
“no,
we
will
not
be
able
to
use
you.”
following
that,
he
filed
his
complaint
with
the
eeoc.
eeoc
made
its
investigation
and
made
its
report.
they
found
that
there
was
reasonable
basis
for
mr.
green
to
bring
a
lawsuit
and
he
filed
one
at
that
time
under
section
704
of
the
act.
case
come
on
for
trial,
well
after
a
period
of
time
had
passed,
mr.
green
filed
his
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
missouri.
it
came
on
for
trial
before
chief
justice
--
chief
judge
meredith
there
and
it
was
tried
for
about
four
days.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
or
before
the
trial
actually
begun,
green
made
an
effort
to
amend
his
petition
to
include
raise
or
cause
of
action
under
703
in
addition
to
704
and
that
was
denied
by
the
court.
the
case
went
to
trial
under
704,
but
during
the
course
of
the
trial
green
attempted
to
interject
1981
civil
rights
act
as
a
basis
for
his
discussion
in
the
trial
of
the
issues
involving
race.
at
the
close
of
that
case,
judge
meredith
made
some
findings,
one
of
which
was
that
the
evidence
shows
that
plaintiff’s
civil
rights
activities
were
not
considered
as
a
factor
and
the
decision
to
layoff
the
plaintiff.
and
then
he
made
these
findings,
and
i
think
it’s
important
for
the
court
to
carefully
consider
just
what
was
before
judge
meredith
and
what
it
was
that
he
found.
he
says
“the
plaintiff
contends
the
defendant
violated
7043
because
of
his
opposition
to
employment
practices.
plaintiff
also
contends
in
his
post
trial
brief
the
defendant’s
refusal
to
hire
him
was
based
on
race
and
his
participation
in
civil
rights
activities,
violation
of
1981
and
this
important
to
conclusion
and
finding
by
the
court.
the
court
feels
that
the
court’s
discussion
of
the
case
under
704
will
effectively
dispose
of
any
claim
arising
under
section
1981.”
and
these
are
the
controlling
standards
that
judge
meredith
applied
in
reaching
his
decision.
he
says
this,
“the
matter
before
the
court’s
controlling
an
ultimate
fact
the
questions
are
whether
the
plaintiff’s
misconduct
is
sufficient
to
justify
defendant’s
refusal
to
rehire,
and
two,
whether
the
‘stall-in’
and
‘lock-in’
are
the
real
reasons
for
defendant’s
refusal
to
rehire
the
plaintiff.”
the
court
finds
that
they
are.
then
the
trial
court
proceeded
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
there
mr.
green
had
failed
to
establish
by
the
greater
way
to
preponderance
that
the
defendant’s
refusal
to
rehire
plaintiff
resulted
from
racial
prejudice
or
plaintiff’s
legitimate
civil
rights
activities.
it
seems
clear
from
the
record
and
then
again
quoting
this
are,
“that
the
defendant’s
reasons
for
refusing
to
rehire
the
plaintiff
were
motivated
solely
and
simply
by
the
plaintiff’s
participation
in
the
stall-in
and
the
lock-in.’
the
burden
of
proving
other
reasons
was
on
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
case
was
appealed
and
went
to
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
under
703.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
but
the
conclusion
of
the
court
there,
your
honor
was,
plaintiff
has
not
shown
the
defendant
was
motivated
by
racial
prejudice
or
because
of
the
plaintiff’s
legitimate
civil
rights
activities.
he
made
the
joint
finding.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
it
was
tried
and
it
was
tried
fairly.
and
four
days
of
trial
and
a
careful
reading
of
the
transcript
will
indicate
that
at
least
80%
of
all
subjects
inquired
about
and
all
questions
do
relate
to
the
question
of
race.
and
i
think
that
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
trial
judge,
the
district
judge
felt
that
under
the
contentions
being
made,
that
he
could
dispose
of
that
issue
in
this
case
and
did
dispose
of
it.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
if
the
lawsuit
had
been
tried
consistent
with
what
that
ruling
striking
race,
if
it
been
tried
consistent
with
that
theory,
yes
i
don’t
think
there’d
be
any
validity
in
our
position
at
all,
but
in
fact
it
wasn’t.
it
was
tried
thoroughly
and
this
was
the
feeling
of
one
member
of
the
panel
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
panel
is
shared
by
four
members
of
that
court.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
position
to
that
your
honor
is
this,
that
there
was
adequate
discovery
and
there
was
enough
discovery
here
to
allow
that
issue
to
be
tried.
there
were
discovery
opportunities
available
to
the
plaintiff’s
counsel
that
he
didn’t
avail
himself
of.
and
voluminous
records
were
in
fact
to
made
him
available
to
any
many
use
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
we
think
that
the
ruling
made
in
the
pretrial
as
to
the
extent
of
the
discovery
was
based
upon
the
unreasonableness
and
burdensomeness
of
it.
it
then
required
for
tons
in
thousands
and
thousands
of
documents
that
were
acquired
weeks
and
weeks
just
to
prepare
all
on
issue
that
doesn’t
seem
to
be
irrelevant
to
of
any
issues
that
the
case
presented.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
looked
at
the
decisions
below
and
affirmed
it
in
every
respect
except
it
sent
it
back
for
a
retrial
on
the
racial
discrimination
issue.
now,
if
the
court
had
stopped
there
and
used
the
basis
raised
by
his
honor
that
it
had
been
stricken
and
so
maybe
he
didn’t
had
his
full
day
in
court
and
going
back
and
try
it
again.
if
it
stopped
there,
the
case
wouldn’t
be
here
today,
but
the
court
did
some
very
significant
additions
to
adjust
that.
it
said
“one,
that
the
prima
facie
case
is
made
when
the
applicant
here,
a
black
man”
--
i
think
i
should
read
that
exactly
as
it
is
from
out
of
the
court’s
opinion.
“when
a
black
man
demonstrates
that
he
possesses
the
qualifications
to
fill
a
job
opening
and
that
he
was
denied
the
job
which
continues
to
remain
open,
we
think
he
present
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination.”
now
what
that
does
is
to
reverse
at
the
point
when
judge
meredith
says
it
was
up
to
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
to
establish
that
his
discharge
or
his
--
the
refusal
to
reinstate
him
was
based
upon
his
race
that
this
was
a
burden
that
the
petitioner
or
that
the
plaintiff
had
in
the
lower
court.
the
eighth
circuit
is
saying
that
he
merely
makes
that
prima
facie
showing
and
then
the
burden
is
upon
the
company
of
mcdonnell
here
to
establish
that
it
was
not
racially
motivated.
now,
in
addition
to
that
the
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof,
i
might
say
at
this
juncture
that
congress
in
considering
this
one
of
the
floor
managers,
we’ve
cited
that
in
our
brief.
one
of
the
floor
managers
carefully
explained
to
members
of
congress
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
these
cases
under
title
vii
will
be
as
it
has
always
been
that
the
burden
will
always
be
on
the
plaintiff,
the
person
bringing
the
lawsuit
and
it
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
this
was
what
congress
intended.
here,
the
eighth
circuit
by
its
opinion
is
shifting
that
burden
of
proof,
but
that’s
not
all
it
did.
second
off,
it
said
that
subjective
elements
from
the
employer,
in
this
case
from
mcdonnell
would
be
given
little
weight
or
its
weight
would
be
limited.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
and
i
might
say
further
to
that
the
third
thing
it
said
was
that
somehow
mcdonnell
would
have
to
establish
or
show
that
under
these
circumstances
its
refusal
to
rehire
green
was
related
to
job
performance,
while
limiting
the
value
or
the
weight
of
subjective
evidence
as
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
did.
test
the
other
imposition
had
plus
the
burden
of
weight
shift
caused
one
member
of
the
eighth
circuit
to
think
that
the
effect
of
this
opinion
would
be
to
order
mcdonnell
to
reinstate
or
rehire
green.
and
the
view
apparently
was
shared
by
four
members
of
the
court.
i
think
it’s
clear
when
the
employer
here
is
inhibited
by
testifying
as
to
his
reasons,
subjective
reasons
for
making
employment
decisions
that
when
that
is
being
told
or
when
the
eighth
circuit
is
telling
the
district
court
that
“you’re
to
give
very
little
weight
to
that”
that
we
think
that
that
means
practically
that
once
the
plaintiff
green
here
would
make
this
prima
facie
case
that
we
couldn’t
rebut
that
prima
facie
case
then
by
showing
that
our
refusal
to
employ
him
was
because
he
attempted
to
sabotage
our
plant,
or
locked
some
of
our
employees
into
the
office
building
downtown.
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
is
saying
that
this
is
to
be
given
very
little
weight
and
it
probably
will
not
justify
your
actions
in
refusing
to
employ.
now
there
seems
to
be
no
question
to
what
unlawful
activity
of
any
person
would
be
adequate
justification
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
hire.
and
i
think
that
would
be
true
whether
the
applicant
is
white,
whether
he
is
an
indian
or
whether
he
is
black,
or
whether
he
is
a
baptist
or
a
jew,
or
catholic.
i
think
that
that
is
clear
and
i
think
the
effect
of
this
opinion,
if
it’s
applied
literally,
will
cause
a
preempt
reversal
discrimination.
for
example,
i
don’t
think
it
could
be
seriously
questioned
that
if
a
white
man
were
to
throw
a
rock
in
the
chairman
of
mcdonnell’s
window
last
night
and
he
called
me
this
morning
and
says
“can
i
discharge
the
man?”
i
would
say
“yes.”
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
yes,
and
if
a
black
man
were
to
throw,
by
this
opinion
is
it’s
been
interpreted
and
as
we
interpret
a
rock
through
his
window,
yes
if
i
could
--
he
could
discharge
him,
i
would
have
to
say
following
the
mandate
of
this
opinion
we’ll
have
to
look
to
see
how
this
might
adversely
influenced
his
ability
to
perform
a
job.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
still
put
him
in
jail.
but
got
out
of
jail,
if
we
had
to
look
at
job
performance,
then
we
could
very
well
be
in
position
of
having
to
get
into
that
before
i
could
be
at
ease
and
say
“no,
you
can’t
discharge
him.”
i
use
that
as
an
illustration
of
how
--
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
i
think
the
rule
would
be
the
same,
your
honor.
i
think
it
applies
to
not
only
to
discharge,
i
think
it
would
apply
to
promotion
and
i
think
it
would
apply
to
job
applicants.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
what
remaining
time
i
have
i’d
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
veryl
l.
riddle
mr.
chief
justice,
i’m
pained
to
have
to
correct
my
brother
counsel
here
on
the
f15
contract
which
he
mentioned
to
the
court
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
not
on
the
record.
the
fact
of
the
matter
that
contract
has
been
awarded
to
mcdonnell
douglas,
and
all
orders
made
with
respect
to
equal
opportunity
employment
had
been
complied
by
and
conformance
with
the
executive
orders
for
quite
sometime.
i’m
pained
to
have
to
deny
that
off
the
record
comment.
i
would
say
in
closing
to
this
court
that
this
law
title
vii
has
been
tremendously
beneficial
in
achieving
the
objectives
identified
by
congress.
and
a
lot
of
lawsuits
had
been
filed
at
the
district
courts
throughout
the
country
and
the
act
has,
i
think,
been
a
success,
remarkable
success.
this
case
particularly
case
as
result
of
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
has
created
a
lot
of
questions
and
has
caused
a
lot
of
concern
by
members
of
the
bar,
by
district
courts
and
by
employers
and
employees
as
well.
i
think
that
the
cause
of
the
complete
reversal
of
the
traditional
principles
that
involve
in
trying
this
issue,
were
the
only
issue
ever
to
determine
the
real
reason
why
a
person
is
refused
employment,
discharged
from
employment,
or
other
action
or
relations
that
he
has
with
his
employer.
and
to
get
at
the
real
issue
in
the
traditional
sense,
courts
have
done
a
good
job
and
they’ll
continue
to
do
a
good
job.
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
at
all,
nothing
in
the
law.
there
is
just
nothing
at
all
in
the
decisions
in
the
past
where
you
have
a
one
on
one,
an
individual
employer
or
an
individual
applicant
to
make
an
application
for
a
job.
and
this
decision,
if
it’s
followed
and
conscientious
district
courts
are
going
to
try
to
follow
it.
for
them
to
try
this,
the
law
be
turned
on
its
head.
and
i
submit
for
those
reasons
that
the
case
certainly
should
be
reversed,
and
we
think
it
ought
to
go
back,
with
an
order
from
this
court
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
who
heard
the
evidence
and
who
concluded
that
this
sort
of
unlawful
conduct
was
not
protected
and
it
would
form
an
abundant
basis
for
refusal
to
employ
any
person.
thank
you.
