mr.
louis
gilden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
want
to
comment
that
judge
meredith
stated
that
the
court
feels
that
the
court’s
discussion
of
the
case
under
42
u.s.c.
--
mr.
louis
gilden
i’m
reading
from
page
a45
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
court
feels
that
the
court’s
discussion
of
the
case
under
42
u.s.c.
2000
(e)
3
(a),
that’s
704
(a),
will
effectively
dispose
of
any
claim
arising
under
section
1981,
section
42
u.s.c.,
section
2000
(e)
(a).
mr.
louis
gilden
that’s
on
the
bottom
of
page
a45.
this
case
was
treated
that’s
a
704
case
all
the
way
through.
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
submit
that
judge
lay’s
comments
that
the
hebrew
expression,
“we
tie
their
hands
and
have
reproached
them
because
they
don’t
use
them”
is
a
classic
statement
of
this
particular
case.
because
plaintiff
green
attempted
to
get
statistical
information
by
interrogatories,
by
motion
of
produce
for
inspection,
and
on
the
question
of
interrogatories
the
court
struck
the
interrogatories
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
oppressive.
on
the
question
of
the
motion
of
produce
for
inspection,
the
court
said
specifically
in
its
opinion
that
this
is
a
race
case
and
therefore
you’re
not
entitled
to
all
these
statistics.
so
therefore,
on
two
occasions
plaintiff
had
to
come
in
and
try
this
case
knowing
full
well
what
the
decision
of
the
court,
704
(a);
both
on
the
question
of
motion
to
produce
for
inspection
and
both
in
the
comments
of
the
court
in
its
opinion
that’s
a
704
(a)
case.
this
case
was
tried
totally
as
a
704
(a)
case.
the
only
statistics
that
were
brought
in
the
court
were
by
mr.
peter
robertson
who
was
a
representative
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
he
came
in
on
the
eve
of
trial,
and
he
was
of
that
time
in
1965
a
representative
of
the
missouri
commission
on
human
rights.
and
he
at
that
time
did
the
investigation
of
the
case,
and
he
came
in
with
some
statistical
information.
and
night
he
came
on
the
eve
of
trial
and
i
interviewed
him
just
prior
to
trial.
i
had
no
opportunity,
i
was
plaintiff’s
counsel.
i
had
no
opportunity
to
produce
any
of
these
figures.
i
was
foreclosed
totally
from
introducing
the
statistics
on
employment.
if
this
was
a
race
case
i
would
like
to
see
it.
it’s
never
been
submitted
on
the
--
as
statistical
case
before
judge
meredith.
it
was
totally
a
704
(a)
case.
the
records
that
were
brought
in
by
mr.
peter
robertson
related
primarily
to
his
disparate
treatment
when
he
worked
for
mcdonnell
douglas
before
his
layoff
in
august
of
1964.
this
case
is
a
case
to
be
tried
and
listened
to
on
its
particular
issue,
the
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
riddle
has
gone
through
a
whole
chronology
of
the
“stall-in”
and
the
“lock-in”
and
the
“lock-in”
is
not
a
matter
before
this
court.
the
court
held
that
mr.
green
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
louis
gilden
the
“lock-in”
did
take
place,
that’s
correct.
the
“stall-in”
did
take
place.
mr.
green
pled
guilty
to
the
“stall-in”.
he
was
out
there
for
ten
minutes
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
in
october
of
1964
there
was
no
equal
employment
opportunity
act.
the
act
became
effective
july
the
2nd
1965.
there
was
no
legal
recourse.
in
any
of
the
laws
of
this
country,
we
didn’t
know
about
1981
at
that
time.
that
became
somewhat
crystal
clear
after
jones
v.
mayer.
we
didn’t
know
about
1981.
we
only
knew
about
the
equal
employment
act
that
had
been
enacted
in
july
of
1964
to
become
effective
in
july
of
1965
that’s
the
all
we
knew.
and
on
that
particular
date,
what
was
he
protesting?
he
was
protesting
discrimination
in
employment
of
mcdonnell
douglas.
that’s
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
submit
that.
that
isn’t
my
position
in
this
case.
mcdonnell
can
use
that
reason
and
--
but
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
before,
was
a
record
on
704
(a).
they
had
a
record
before
them
that
showed
the
treatment
of
green
when
he
was
working
for
mcdonnell
douglas
and
they
saw
that
in
august
of
1964
when
this
totem
pole
was
drawn
up
that
the
vice-president
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
based
upon
the
evidence
of
mr.
robertson,
drew
a
line
over
green’s
name
and
he
was
the
highest
senior
man
in
a
whole
department
of
100
white
men
in
a
research
department.
the
only
black
man
and
they
drew
the
line
over
his
name
as
the
man
to
be
laid
off.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
i’m
that’s
the
response
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
think
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
important
in
terms
of
what
the
courts
tell
a
prima
facie
case
would
be
in
this
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit.
i
think
it’s
a
question
of
what
the
court
knew
at
that
particular
time
based
upon
the
evidence
before
it,
and
what
green
would
introduce
in
the
race
case.
and
that
he
would
show
the
treatment
he
had
to
show
that
the
treatment
of
discrimination
when
he
works
there
continue
when
he
applied
for
the
job
in
--
mr.
louis
gilden
oh!
no,
i’m
not
saying
if
they
--
mr.
louis
gilden
that’s
correct,
but
only
on
those
facts
mr.
justice
stewart,
only
on
those
facts.
they
knew
that
green
was
qualified.
they
said
that
in
the
opinion.
mr.
louis
gilden
that’s
right.
mr.
louis
gilden
yes,
but
the
court
said
that
he
could
--
that
green
could
show
that
the
reasons
given
were
protectoral,
and
that
would
go
to
the
race
situation.
mr.
louis
gilden
and
that
he
could
show
that
the
real
reason
like
green
wasn’t
hired
was
because
the
way
they
treated
him
before.
that
--
mr.
louis
gilden
that’s
correct.
and
they
could
also
show
that
they
also
have
this
as
part
of
the
record
that
mr.
riddle
said
there
were
14
or
15
reasons
why
he
wasn’t
hired.
14
or
15
reasons,
now
they
only
two
reasons
and
they
also
brought
in
the
record
that
there
was
the
picketing
of
mr.
mcdonnell’s
home
from
the
street,
not
anywhere
near
the
house.
and
one
of
the
witnesses
talked
about
that
as
a
basis
for
not
hiring.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
trial
on
the
race
case
before
the
district
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
they
didn’t
your
honor.
what
they
did,
they
didn’t
shift
the
burden.
the
burden
of
proof
was
still
with
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
no.
they
didn’t
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
louis
gilden
oh!
no,
they
didn’t
say
that.
they
only
said
that
employment
decisions
based
upon
subjective
criteria.
they
didn’t
say
subjective
evidence,
they
said
subjective
criteria.
and
this
court
in
greek
said
that
congress
directed
the
thrust
of
the
act
against
the
consequences
of
employment
decisions,
not
simply
the
motivation
and
the
consequences
would
not
for
highly
--
mr.
louis
gilden
in
the
statute
in
terms
of
subjective
evidence?
it
goes
into
some
of
the
case
law
that
we’ve
had
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
weight
to
be
given
to
subjective
criteria.
not
subjective
evidence,
subjective
criteria.
in
fact,
the
second
question
presented
by
mcdonnell
here
doesn’t
even
relate
to
the
decision.
they
did
not
bore
mcdonnell
from
introducing
subjective
evidence.
nothing
in
the
opinion
saying
that,
nothing.
mr.
louis
gilden
there’s
nothing
specifically
in
the
statute
relating
to
what
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
in
a
case
involving
an
application
for
employment.
not
specifically
stated.
but
the
court
had
before
a
somewhat
shallow
record
based
upon
704
(a).
they
knew
how
green
had
been
treated
and
based
upon
the
facts
before
them.
they
set
forth
what
could
constitute
a
prima
facie
case.
and
then
they
anticipated,
they
anticipated
that
green
could
come
forward
--
would
have
to
come
forward
more
with
more
evidence.
they
anticipated,
they
said
that
because
after
they
said
mcdonnell
would
have
to
show
that
the
reasons
they
didn’t
hire
green
were
because
he
was
irresponsible
toward
his
work.
they
then
said
that
green
would
have
to
come
back
and
show
that
the
reasons
were
protectoral
or
else
mcdonnell
douglas
had
engaged
racial
discriminatory
practices
at
the
plant.
and
they
showed
what
the
burden
would
have
to
be
with
green
later
on.
they
didn’t
anticipate
that
he
could
rest
at
the
close
of
his
prima
facie,
so
called
minimal
prima
facie
showing.
that
he
would
have
to
come
back.
they
also
knew
that
mcdonnell
would
come
in
with
the
“stall-in”
as
a
reason,
and
they
would
--
and
green
would
have
to
come
in
and
show
that
reason
that
it
was
protectoral.
mr.
louis
gilden
there’s
no
question
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff,
your
honor.
and
there’s
no
question
that
we
--
that
green
was
called
upon
to
assume
that
burden
before
the
district
court.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
and
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
mcdonnell
hasn’t
even
appealed
that
point
to
this
court.
they
haven’t
even
raised
it.
they
have
raised
two
hypothetical
questions
before
this
court
that
are
nearly
going
to
be
somewhat
helpful,
i
assume,
if
this
court
remands
this
case
to
district
court
in
terms
of
what
some
of
the
guidelines
and
standards
might
be.
can
in
a
title
vii
case,
is
an
employer
supposed
to
hire
a
person
who
engages,
a
black
man
who
engages
in
unlawful
activities?
that’s
a
matter
for
the
district
court
to
decide
in
either
--
if
that
were
the
only
fact
presented
that
would
be
a
matter
of
judging
for
the
district
court.
but
the
court
contemplated
more
facts.
it
contemplated
more
discover,
more
information.
i
might
submit,
i
might
submit,
this
makes
it
part,
it’s
not
part
of
this
record
at
all.
and
as
a
matter
not
in
the
record,
it
was
a
matter
that
was
presented
by
the
appendix
in
the
appellate
court
that
subsequent
to
these
proceedings,
the
f15
contract
was
denied
in
mcdonnell
douglas
by
the
secretary
of
defense
on
the
ground
that
they
were
discriminating
against
blacks.
that
was
subsequent
to
the
trial
of
percy
green
against
mcdonnell
douglas.
now
if
a
contract
was
denied
to
mcdonnell
douglas
on
the
f15
because
they
were
engaged
relations
discriminatory
factors,
i’m
quite
sure
that
relay
some
substance
not
for
just
going
back
to
the
court
on
some
pretence,
but
on
the
basis
that
we
have
something
to
talk
about.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
your
honor
the
dynamiting
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
dynamiting
certainly
would
be
objective
evidence.
there’s
nothing
subjective
about
dynamiting
of
building
--
mr.
louis
gilden
the
court
never
said,
mr.
chief
justice
that
they
couldn’t
introduce
that.
they
just
said
that
the
courts
filed
them
that
mcdonnell
would
come
in
with
that
evidence
on
the
race
case.
mr.
louis
gilden
your
honor,
i
don’t
really
read
the
opinion
that
way.
i
read
it
on
the
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
it
doesn’t
say
that
specifically.
it
says
that
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
it
says
that
employment
decisions
based
upon
subjective
criteria
carry
little
weight.
they
didn’t
say
they
forebode
them
from
producing
it
at
evidence.
carry
little
weight
and
that’s
just
the
line
of
decisions
that
the
eighth
circuit
just
went
ahead
and
went
along
with.
that
wasn’t
a
fact
that
they
were
mandating
a
district
court
to
keep
out
the
“stall-in.”
the
“stall-in”
was
objective.
there’s
nothing
subjective
about
a
“stall-in.”
mr.
louis
gilden
the
“stall-in?”
mr.
louis
gilden
yes,
it
was.
mr.
louis
gilden
on
the
704
(a)
issue
your
honor,
on
the
704
(a)
issue
they
decided
on
that
basis,
because
the
court
was
very
specific
about
how
they’re
trying
this
case.
they
never
--
the
court
never
changed
this
opinion,
and
its
opinion
and
in
its
ruling
on
the
discovery
etcetera,
it
was
not
a
race
case.
it
was
a
704
(a)
civil
rights
protest
case.
and
there
were
two
allegations
that
green
had
made
in
his
complaint
before
eeoc,
civil
rights
and
the
question
of
race.
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
had
merely
made
one
finding
and
that
was
on
civil
rights,
and
what
the
district
court
did
was
strike
race
because
it
felt
that
there
had
to
be
a
reasonable
cause
finding
as
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
institution
of
an
action
under
title
vii.
and
then
in
fact,
mcdonnell
were
the
ones
who
filed
the
motion
to
strike
race
from
the
pleading.
the
court
didn’t
do
it
on
its
own.
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
race
case,
and
the
case
was
tried
strictly
on
that.
mr.
louis
gilden
what
page
is
that?
is
that
--
mr.
louis
gilden
your
honor,
that
was
excised
from
the
opinion.
that’s
the
original
opinion.
mr.
louis
gilden
yes,
that
was
excised
and
that’s
why
i
--
we
had
carried,
you
see
point
five
was
totally
excised
and
changed
by
judge
bright,
and
the
opinion
was
changed
to
griggs
opinion
to
a
non-griggs
opinion.
and
so
i
think
what
some
confusion
in
this
because
you
have
to
read
the
new
point
five
which
is
carried
on
page
a31.
mr.
louis
gilden
you
mean
the
original.a5?
mr.
louis
gilden
i
don’t
think
it
has
any
bearing
whatsoever.
it’s
--
court
made
a
change
in
this
decision
and
i
think
what
all
they
called
upon
to
make
decisions
upon
the
change.
i
don’t
think
we’re
called
upon
to
anticipate
or
to
make
this
court
--
no
court
would
rebound
by
a
court
that
struck
the
original
opinion,
use
the
original
opinion
as
a
basis
for
law.
the
only
opinion
we
have
before
us
is
a31
to
a33
which
is
that
close
to
two
pages
which
sets
forth
a
standards,
and
that
case
they
said
“however
applicants
past
participation
in
unlawful
conduct
directed
as
prospective
employer
might
indicate
the
applicant’s
lack
of
a
response
or
attitude
toward
performing
work
for
that
employer.”
but
they
didn’t
say
“it
had
to
be
job
related.”
it
didn’t
say
it
had
to
be
job
related.
it
was
not
a
griggs
decision.
mr.
louis
gilden
right,
right.
and
i
think
the
reason
they’re
saying
that
your
honor
is
this.
that
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
would
say
that
the
start
--
mr.
louis
gilden
yes,
that’s
right.
i
would
say
that
the
“stall-in”
would
be
a
basis
for
a
trial
judge
to
consider
and
the
totality
of
the
evidence
before
it
as
to
whether
or
not
racial
discrimination
was
the
reason
that
green
wasn’t
hired
in
july
of
1965,
or
whether
that
“stall-in”
was
in
october
of
1964
where
there
was
no
equal
employment
opportunity
act
was
the
basis.
and
the
court
was
sending
this
matter
back
for
what
the
real
reasons
for.
whether
the
reasons
were
protectoral
--
mr.
louis
gilden
if
that
were
the
only
fact,
your
honor?
mr.
louis
gilden
i
would
say
that
could
be
a
basis
for
not
hiring,
yes,
if
that
was
the
only
fact.
if
that
was
the
only
fact
that.
if
that
was
the
only
fact
before
the
district
court,
but
the
court
contemplated
it.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
would
say
that
the
court
make
a
decision
based
upon
the
guidelines
and
standards
set
forth
in
the
opinion
as
to
whether
the
question
of
a
“stall-in”
against
an
employer
complaining
about
racial
discrimination
on
the
plant,
in
october
of
1964
would
be
an
irresponsible
attitude
towards
employer
for
the
type
of
illegal
protest
he
was
engaged
in,
and
that’s
the
determination
the
court
would
make,
the
district
court
would
make
based
upon
the
facts
before
it.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
you
know
this
is
a
double-edged
sword.
they
--
mcdonnell,
i
would
say
it’s
not
in
the
statute.
this
is
mere
dictum
in
the
court,
into
the
court’s
decisions.
the
basic
decision
relates
to
whether
or
not
green
had
to
have
a
reasonable
cause
finding
as
a
statutory
prerequisite
to
the
institution
of
an
action.
that’s
t
the
only
decision
before
the
eighth
circuit.
this
is
where
dictum
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
would
say
that
he
would
think
about
the
guidelines
set
up
by
the
eighth
circuit,
but
its
dictum.
that’s
not
the
rule
of
the
case.
mr.
louis
gilden
it
is
pretty
pointed,
yes.
and
i
would
say
that
a
district
court
would
do
well
to
submit
to
those
guidelines
and
i
submit
that
that
is
based
upon
these
facts.
based
upon
the
facts
submitted
before
the
appellate
court
that
these
guidelines
would
be
appropriate
because
the
court
was
well
aware
of
what
evidence
was
--
had
been
submitted
on
the
704
(a)
issue,
and
based
upon
these
guidelines
that
was
--
that
would
be
appropriate.
i
submit
that
the
two
questions
that
have
been
presented
for
this
court
aren’t
even
rules
of
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
a
black
man
can
be
denied
employment
if
he
engages
in
civil
rights
protest
under
title
vii,
and
the
questions
of
subjective
evidence.
there’s
nothing
in
any
of
the
decisions
which
would
keep
mcdonnell
douglas
from
submitting
subjective
evidence
before
the
trial
judge.
if
that’s
all
they
had
and
i
might
state
for
this
court,
and
this
court
well
knows
that
if
i
come
into
court
as
mr.
crone
did
in
the
trial
and
said
“i
don’t
discriminate
against
blacks.”
what
kind
of
a
statement
is
that?
that’s
a
subjective
statement.
that’s
not
objective.
what
the
court
is
saying
in
subjective
criteria
is
a
near
sort
of
declamation
about
your
own
integrity
and
your
virtue
and
your
own
honesty.
i
do
not
discriminate
against
blacks.
that
kind
of
declaiming
about
how
virtuous
you
are
and
honest
you
are
and
how
good
a
person
you
are.
that
is
subjective
evidence,
but
when
you
come
in
and
say
that
somebody
engages
in
some
activity
or
behavior,
there
would
be
something
objective.
the
court
never
says
the
“stall-in”
was
not
objective.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
think
judge
johnson
was
still
relating
to
the
excised
opinion,
your
honor.
he
was
still
going
into
job
performance
in
his
second
dissenting
opinion
and
i
had
he
read
the
decision
a
little
more
closely,
he
would’ve
come
the
decision
that
the
question
of
griggs,
griggs
was
not
before
the
court.
the
question
of
job
performance
was
not
before
the
court,
and
the
court
had
carefully
laid
down
very,
very
accurate
and
very
precise
standards
for
the
district
court
to
be
guided
by.
i
submit
that
there’s
only
one
issue,
and
i’ve
been
kept
from
my
discovery
on
race
as
to
mcdonnell
douglas
is
engaged
in
racial
discriminatory
practices.
i
haven’t
had
that
trial.
it
hasn’t
been
tried.
i
submit
that
green
should
have
that
trial.
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
the
reasons
given
were
protectoral.
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
the
broad
statistics,
if
there
are
any,
and
i
assume
that
might
be
in
view
of
what
happened
and
which
i’ve
informed
the
court
about.
about
he
racial
discriminatory
hiring
practice
at
mcdonnell
douglas
and
based
upon
that,
i
hope
to
prevail
a
district
court
again
if
this
court
gives
me
this
opportunity.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
louis
gilden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
want
to
comment
that
judge
meredith
stated
that
the
court
feels
that
the
court’s
discussion
of
the
case
under
42
u.s.c.
--
mr.
louis
gilden
i’m
reading
from
page
a45
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
court
feels
that
the
court’s
discussion
of
the
case
under
42
u.s.c.
2000
(e)
3
(a),
that’s
704
(a),
will
effectively
dispose
of
any
claim
arising
under
section
1981,
section
42
u.s.c.,
section
2000
(e)
(a).
mr.
louis
gilden
that’s
on
the
bottom
of
page
a45.
this
case
was
treated
that’s
a
704
case
all
the
way
through.
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
submit
that
judge
lay’s
comments
that
the
hebrew
expression,
“we
tie
their
hands
and
have
reproached
them
because
they
don’t
use
them”
is
a
classic
statement
of
this
particular
case.
because
plaintiff
green
attempted
to
get
statistical
information
by
interrogatories,
by
motion
of
produce
for
inspection,
and
on
the
question
of
interrogatories
the
court
struck
the
interrogatories
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
oppressive.
on
the
question
of
the
motion
of
produce
for
inspection,
the
court
said
specifically
in
its
opinion
that
this
is
a
race
case
and
therefore
you’re
not
entitled
to
all
these
statistics.
so
therefore,
on
two
occasions
plaintiff
had
to
come
in
and
try
this
case
knowing
full
well
what
the
decision
of
the
court,
704
(a);
both
on
the
question
of
motion
to
produce
for
inspection
and
both
in
the
comments
of
the
court
in
its
opinion
that’s
a
704
(a)
case.
this
case
was
tried
totally
as
a
704
(a)
case.
the
only
statistics
that
were
brought
in
the
court
were
by
mr.
peter
robertson
who
was
a
representative
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
he
came
in
on
the
eve
of
trial,
and
he
was
of
that
time
in
1965
a
representative
of
the
missouri
commission
on
human
rights.
and
he
at
that
time
did
the
investigation
of
the
case,
and
he
came
in
with
some
statistical
information.
and
night
he
came
on
the
eve
of
trial
and
i
interviewed
him
just
prior
to
trial.
i
had
no
opportunity,
i
was
plaintiff’s
counsel.
i
had
no
opportunity
to
produce
any
of
these
figures.
i
was
foreclosed
totally
from
introducing
the
statistics
on
employment.
if
this
was
a
race
case
i
would
like
to
see
it.
it’s
never
been
submitted
on
the
--
as
statistical
case
before
judge
meredith.
it
was
totally
a
704
(a)
case.
the
records
that
were
brought
in
by
mr.
peter
robertson
related
primarily
to
his
disparate
treatment
when
he
worked
for
mcdonnell
douglas
before
his
layoff
in
august
of
1964.
this
case
is
a
case
to
be
tried
and
listened
to
on
its
particular
issue,
the
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
riddle
has
gone
through
a
whole
chronology
of
the
“stall-in”
and
the
“lock-in”
and
the
“lock-in”
is
not
a
matter
before
this
court.
the
court
held
that
mr.
green
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
louis
gilden
the
“lock-in”
did
take
place,
that’s
correct.
the
“stall-in”
did
take
place.
mr.
green
pled
guilty
to
the
“stall-in”.
he
was
out
there
for
ten
minutes
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
in
october
of
1964
there
was
no
equal
employment
opportunity
act.
the
act
became
effective
july
the
2nd
1965.
there
was
no
legal
recourse.
in
any
of
the
laws
of
this
country,
we
didn’t
know
about
1981
at
that
time.
that
became
somewhat
crystal
clear
after
jones
v.
mayer.
we
didn’t
know
about
1981.
we
only
knew
about
the
equal
employment
act
that
had
been
enacted
in
july
of
1964
to
become
effective
in
july
of
1965
that’s
the
all
we
knew.
and
on
that
particular
date,
what
was
he
protesting?
he
was
protesting
discrimination
in
employment
of
mcdonnell
douglas.
that’s
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
submit
that.
that
isn’t
my
position
in
this
case.
mcdonnell
can
use
that
reason
and
--
but
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
before,
was
a
record
on
704
(a).
they
had
a
record
before
them
that
showed
the
treatment
of
green
when
he
was
working
for
mcdonnell
douglas
and
they
saw
that
in
august
of
1964
when
this
totem
pole
was
drawn
up
that
the
vice-president
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
based
upon
the
evidence
of
mr.
robertson,
drew
a
line
over
green’s
name
and
he
was
the
highest
senior
man
in
a
whole
department
of
100
white
men
in
a
research
department.
the
only
black
man
and
they
drew
the
line
over
his
name
as
the
man
to
be
laid
off.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
i’m
that’s
the
response
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
think
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
important
in
terms
of
what
the
courts
tell
a
prima
facie
case
would
be
in
this
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit.
i
think
it’s
a
question
of
what
the
court
knew
at
that
particular
time
based
upon
the
evidence
before
it,
and
what
green
would
introduce
in
the
race
case.
and
that
he
would
show
the
treatment
he
had
to
show
that
the
treatment
of
discrimination
when
he
works
there
continue
when
he
applied
for
the
job
in
--
mr.
louis
gilden
oh!
no,
i’m
not
saying
if
they
--
mr.
louis
gilden
that’s
correct,
but
only
on
those
facts
mr.
justice
stewart,
only
on
those
facts.
they
knew
that
green
was
qualified.
they
said
that
in
the
opinion.
mr.
louis
gilden
that’s
right.
mr.
louis
gilden
yes,
but
the
court
said
that
he
could
--
that
green
could
show
that
the
reasons
given
were
protectoral,
and
that
would
go
to
the
race
situation.
mr.
louis
gilden
and
that
he
could
show
that
the
real
reason
like
green
wasn’t
hired
was
because
the
way
they
treated
him
before.
that
--
mr.
louis
gilden
that’s
correct.
and
they
could
also
show
that
they
also
have
this
as
part
of
the
record
that
mr.
riddle
said
there
were
14
or
15
reasons
why
he
wasn’t
hired.
14
or
15
reasons,
now
they
only
two
reasons
and
they
also
brought
in
the
record
that
there
was
the
picketing
of
mr.
mcdonnell’s
home
from
the
street,
not
anywhere
near
the
house.
and
one
of
the
witnesses
talked
about
that
as
a
basis
for
not
hiring.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
trial
on
the
race
case
before
the
district
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
they
didn’t
your
honor.
what
they
did,
they
didn’t
shift
the
burden.
the
burden
of
proof
was
still
with
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
no.
they
didn’t
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
louis
gilden
oh!
no,
they
didn’t
say
that.
they
only
said
that
employment
decisions
based
upon
subjective
criteria.
they
didn’t
say
subjective
evidence,
they
said
subjective
criteria.
and
this
court
in
greek
said
that
congress
directed
the
thrust
of
the
act
against
the
consequences
of
employment
decisions,
not
simply
the
motivation
and
the
consequences
would
not
for
highly
--
mr.
louis
gilden
in
the
statute
in
terms
of
subjective
evidence?
it
goes
into
some
of
the
case
law
that
we’ve
had
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
weight
to
be
given
to
subjective
criteria.
not
subjective
evidence,
subjective
criteria.
in
fact,
the
second
question
presented
by
mcdonnell
here
doesn’t
even
relate
to
the
decision.
they
did
not
bore
mcdonnell
from
introducing
subjective
evidence.
nothing
in
the
opinion
saying
that,
nothing.
mr.
louis
gilden
there’s
nothing
specifically
in
the
statute
relating
to
what
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
in
a
case
involving
an
application
for
employment.
not
specifically
stated.
but
the
court
had
before
a
somewhat
shallow
record
based
upon
704
(a).
they
knew
how
green
had
been
treated
and
based
upon
the
facts
before
them.
they
set
forth
what
could
constitute
a
prima
facie
case.
and
then
they
anticipated,
they
anticipated
that
green
could
come
forward
--
would
have
to
come
forward
more
with
more
evidence.
they
anticipated,
they
said
that
because
after
they
said
mcdonnell
would
have
to
show
that
the
reasons
they
didn’t
hire
green
were
because
he
was
irresponsible
toward
his
work.
they
then
said
that
green
would
have
to
come
back
and
show
that
the
reasons
were
protectoral
or
else
mcdonnell
douglas
had
engaged
racial
discriminatory
practices
at
the
plant.
and
they
showed
what
the
burden
would
have
to
be
with
green
later
on.
they
didn’t
anticipate
that
he
could
rest
at
the
close
of
his
prima
facie,
so
called
minimal
prima
facie
showing.
that
he
would
have
to
come
back.
they
also
knew
that
mcdonnell
would
come
in
with
the
“stall-in”
as
a
reason,
and
they
would
--
and
green
would
have
to
come
in
and
show
that
reason
that
it
was
protectoral.
mr.
louis
gilden
there’s
no
question
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff,
your
honor.
and
there’s
no
question
that
we
--
that
green
was
called
upon
to
assume
that
burden
before
the
district
court.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
and
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
mcdonnell
hasn’t
even
appealed
that
point
to
this
court.
they
haven’t
even
raised
it.
they
have
raised
two
hypothetical
questions
before
this
court
that
are
nearly
going
to
be
somewhat
helpful,
i
assume,
if
this
court
remands
this
case
to
district
court
in
terms
of
what
some
of
the
guidelines
and
standards
might
be.
can
in
a
title
vii
case,
is
an
employer
supposed
to
hire
a
person
who
engages,
a
black
man
who
engages
in
unlawful
activities?
that’s
a
matter
for
the
district
court
to
decide
in
either
--
if
that
were
the
only
fact
presented
that
would
be
a
matter
of
judging
for
the
district
court.
but
the
court
contemplated
more
facts.
it
contemplated
more
discover,
more
information.
i
might
submit,
i
might
submit,
this
makes
it
part,
it’s
not
part
of
this
record
at
all.
and
as
a
matter
not
in
the
record,
it
was
a
matter
that
was
presented
by
the
appendix
in
the
appellate
court
that
subsequent
to
these
proceedings,
the
f15
contract
was
denied
in
mcdonnell
douglas
by
the
secretary
of
defense
on
the
ground
that
they
were
discriminating
against
blacks.
that
was
subsequent
to
the
trial
of
percy
green
against
mcdonnell
douglas.
now
if
a
contract
was
denied
to
mcdonnell
douglas
on
the
f15
because
they
were
engaged
relations
discriminatory
factors,
i’m
quite
sure
that
relay
some
substance
not
for
just
going
back
to
the
court
on
some
pretence,
but
on
the
basis
that
we
have
something
to
talk
about.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
your
honor
the
dynamiting
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
dynamiting
certainly
would
be
objective
evidence.
there’s
nothing
subjective
about
dynamiting
of
building
--
mr.
louis
gilden
the
court
never
said,
mr.
chief
justice
that
they
couldn’t
introduce
that.
they
just
said
that
the
courts
filed
them
that
mcdonnell
would
come
in
with
that
evidence
on
the
race
case.
mr.
louis
gilden
your
honor,
i
don’t
really
read
the
opinion
that
way.
i
read
it
on
the
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
it
doesn’t
say
that
specifically.
it
says
that
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
it
says
that
employment
decisions
based
upon
subjective
criteria
carry
little
weight.
they
didn’t
say
they
forebode
them
from
producing
it
at
evidence.
carry
little
weight
and
that’s
just
the
line
of
decisions
that
the
eighth
circuit
just
went
ahead
and
went
along
with.
that
wasn’t
a
fact
that
they
were
mandating
a
district
court
to
keep
out
the
“stall-in.”
the
“stall-in”
was
objective.
there’s
nothing
subjective
about
a
“stall-in.”
mr.
louis
gilden
the
“stall-in?”
mr.
louis
gilden
yes,
it
was.
mr.
louis
gilden
on
the
704
(a)
issue
your
honor,
on
the
704
(a)
issue
they
decided
on
that
basis,
because
the
court
was
very
specific
about
how
they’re
trying
this
case.
they
never
--
the
court
never
changed
this
opinion,
and
its
opinion
and
in
its
ruling
on
the
discovery
etcetera,
it
was
not
a
race
case.
it
was
a
704
(a)
civil
rights
protest
case.
and
there
were
two
allegations
that
green
had
made
in
his
complaint
before
eeoc,
civil
rights
and
the
question
of
race.
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
had
merely
made
one
finding
and
that
was
on
civil
rights,
and
what
the
district
court
did
was
strike
race
because
it
felt
that
there
had
to
be
a
reasonable
cause
finding
as
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
institution
of
an
action
under
title
vii.
and
then
in
fact,
mcdonnell
were
the
ones
who
filed
the
motion
to
strike
race
from
the
pleading.
the
court
didn’t
do
it
on
its
own.
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
race
case,
and
the
case
was
tried
strictly
on
that.
mr.
louis
gilden
what
page
is
that?
is
that
--
mr.
louis
gilden
your
honor,
that
was
excised
from
the
opinion.
that’s
the
original
opinion.
mr.
louis
gilden
yes,
that
was
excised
and
that’s
why
i
--
we
had
carried,
you
see
point
five
was
totally
excised
and
changed
by
judge
bright,
and
the
opinion
was
changed
to
griggs
opinion
to
a
non-griggs
opinion.
and
so
i
think
what
some
confusion
in
this
because
you
have
to
read
the
new
point
five
which
is
carried
on
page
a31.
mr.
louis
gilden
you
mean
the
original.a5?
mr.
louis
gilden
i
don’t
think
it
has
any
bearing
whatsoever.
it’s
--
court
made
a
change
in
this
decision
and
i
think
what
all
they
called
upon
to
make
decisions
upon
the
change.
i
don’t
think
we’re
called
upon
to
anticipate
or
to
make
this
court
--
no
court
would
rebound
by
a
court
that
struck
the
original
opinion,
use
the
original
opinion
as
a
basis
for
law.
the
only
opinion
we
have
before
us
is
a31
to
a33
which
is
that
close
to
two
pages
which
sets
forth
a
standards,
and
that
case
they
said
“however
applicants
past
participation
in
unlawful
conduct
directed
as
prospective
employer
might
indicate
the
applicant’s
lack
of
a
response
or
attitude
toward
performing
work
for
that
employer.”
but
they
didn’t
say
“it
had
to
be
job
related.”
it
didn’t
say
it
had
to
be
job
related.
it
was
not
a
griggs
decision.
mr.
louis
gilden
right,
right.
and
i
think
the
reason
they’re
saying
that
your
honor
is
this.
that
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
would
say
that
the
start
--
mr.
louis
gilden
yes,
that’s
right.
i
would
say
that
the
“stall-in”
would
be
a
basis
for
a
trial
judge
to
consider
and
the
totality
of
the
evidence
before
it
as
to
whether
or
not
racial
discrimination
was
the
reason
that
green
wasn’t
hired
in
july
of
1965,
or
whether
that
“stall-in”
was
in
october
of
1964
where
there
was
no
equal
employment
opportunity
act
was
the
basis.
and
the
court
was
sending
this
matter
back
for
what
the
real
reasons
for.
whether
the
reasons
were
protectoral
--
mr.
louis
gilden
if
that
were
the
only
fact,
your
honor?
mr.
louis
gilden
i
would
say
that
could
be
a
basis
for
not
hiring,
yes,
if
that
was
the
only
fact.
if
that
was
the
only
fact
that.
if
that
was
the
only
fact
before
the
district
court,
but
the
court
contemplated
it.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
would
say
that
the
court
make
a
decision
based
upon
the
guidelines
and
standards
set
forth
in
the
opinion
as
to
whether
the
question
of
a
“stall-in”
against
an
employer
complaining
about
racial
discrimination
on
the
plant,
in
october
of
1964
would
be
an
irresponsible
attitude
towards
employer
for
the
type
of
illegal
protest
he
was
engaged
in,
and
that’s
the
determination
the
court
would
make,
the
district
court
would
make
based
upon
the
facts
before
it.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
you
know
this
is
a
double-edged
sword.
they
--
mcdonnell,
i
would
say
it’s
not
in
the
statute.
this
is
mere
dictum
in
the
court,
into
the
court’s
decisions.
the
basic
decision
relates
to
whether
or
not
green
had
to
have
a
reasonable
cause
finding
as
a
statutory
prerequisite
to
the
institution
of
an
action.
that’s
t
the
only
decision
before
the
eighth
circuit.
this
is
where
dictum
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
would
say
that
he
would
think
about
the
guidelines
set
up
by
the
eighth
circuit,
but
its
dictum.
that’s
not
the
rule
of
the
case.
mr.
louis
gilden
it
is
pretty
pointed,
yes.
and
i
would
say
that
a
district
court
would
do
well
to
submit
to
those
guidelines
and
i
submit
that
that
is
based
upon
these
facts.
based
upon
the
facts
submitted
before
the
appellate
court
that
these
guidelines
would
be
appropriate
because
the
court
was
well
aware
of
what
evidence
was
--
had
been
submitted
on
the
704
(a)
issue,
and
based
upon
these
guidelines
that
was
--
that
would
be
appropriate.
i
submit
that
the
two
questions
that
have
been
presented
for
this
court
aren’t
even
rules
of
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
a
black
man
can
be
denied
employment
if
he
engages
in
civil
rights
protest
under
title
vii,
and
the
questions
of
subjective
evidence.
there’s
nothing
in
any
of
the
decisions
which
would
keep
mcdonnell
douglas
from
submitting
subjective
evidence
before
the
trial
judge.
if
that’s
all
they
had
and
i
might
state
for
this
court,
and
this
court
well
knows
that
if
i
come
into
court
as
mr.
crone
did
in
the
trial
and
said
“i
don’t
discriminate
against
blacks.”
what
kind
of
a
statement
is
that?
that’s
a
subjective
statement.
that’s
not
objective.
what
the
court
is
saying
in
subjective
criteria
is
a
near
sort
of
declamation
about
your
own
integrity
and
your
virtue
and
your
own
honesty.
i
do
not
discriminate
against
blacks.
that
kind
of
declaiming
about
how
virtuous
you
are
and
honest
you
are
and
how
good
a
person
you
are.
that
is
subjective
evidence,
but
when
you
come
in
and
say
that
somebody
engages
in
some
activity
or
behavior,
there
would
be
something
objective.
the
court
never
says
the
“stall-in”
was
not
objective.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
think
judge
johnson
was
still
relating
to
the
excised
opinion,
your
honor.
he
was
still
going
into
job
performance
in
his
second
dissenting
opinion
and
i
had
he
read
the
decision
a
little
more
closely,
he
would’ve
come
the
decision
that
the
question
of
griggs,
griggs
was
not
before
the
court.
the
question
of
job
performance
was
not
before
the
court,
and
the
court
had
carefully
laid
down
very,
very
accurate
and
very
precise
standards
for
the
district
court
to
be
guided
by.
i
submit
that
there’s
only
one
issue,
and
i’ve
been
kept
from
my
discovery
on
race
as
to
mcdonnell
douglas
is
engaged
in
racial
discriminatory
practices.
i
haven’t
had
that
trial.
it
hasn’t
been
tried.
i
submit
that
green
should
have
that
trial.
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
the
reasons
given
were
protectoral.
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
the
broad
statistics,
if
there
are
any,
and
i
assume
that
might
be
in
view
of
what
happened
and
which
i’ve
informed
the
court
about.
about
he
racial
discriminatory
hiring
practice
at
mcdonnell
douglas
and
based
upon
that,
i
hope
to
prevail
a
district
court
again
if
this
court
gives
me
this
opportunity.
thank
you
very
much.
