mcdonnell
douglas
corporation
against
green.
mr.
riddle
you
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how?
give
me
that
number
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
gilden.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
that
includes
the
right
to
use
unlawful
means
and
that
those
unlawful
means
may
never
be
then
taken
into
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
was
one
good
reason
the
fact
that
there
were
14
others,
would
you
think
no
difference
would
make?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
when
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
it,
they
undertook
to
try
to
allocate
the
burden
of
proof.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
not
direct?
did
they
not
direct
the
district
judge
virtually
not
to
give
weight
to
this
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
give
very
little
weight,
if
any?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
find
in
the
statute
that
supports
what
the
court
of
appeals
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
instead
of
having
just
engaged
in
the
blocking
of
the
highway,
“stall-in”
i
guess
that’s
called
here?
he
had
thrown
some
dynamite
under
trucks
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
would
you
think
then
mcdonnell
douglas
would
have
to
assume
the
burden
of
showing
by
objective
evidence
--
some
objective
evidence
to
use
the
court
of
appeals
terms
that
that
rendered
him
an
unsuitable
employee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
anything
subjective
about
blocking
a
public
highway?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
instructed
the
trial
court
in
effect,
you
don’t
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
that
and
really
said
“you’d
better
not
pay
any
attention
to
it.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that’s
the
way
i
read
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
know
how
you
could
read
it
any
other
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
that
evidence
was
before
the
district
court,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
district
court
decided
the
case
on
that
basis,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
there
is
no
significance
to
be
attached
to
the
content
of
the
section
5
after
they
excised
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
focusing
on
that
same
language
where
the
court
said
“however”
this
is
in
the
revised
opinion,
and
after
comes
past
participation
and
unlawful
conduct
directed
at
his
perspective
employer
might
indicate
the
applicant’s
lack
of
a
responsible
attitude.
where
do
you
find
--
what
do
you
find
in
the
statute
that
says
that
employer
might
consider
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
that’s
dictum,
you
mean
the
district
judge
can
completely
ignore
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
pretty
pointed
dictum,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judge
johnson
thought
the
district
court
was
going
to
have
some
problems
with
trying
to
figure
out
just
what
was
the
holding,
and
what
was
dictum,
and
what
was
guideline,
didn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gilden.
you

about
three
minutes
