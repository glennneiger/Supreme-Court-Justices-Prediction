warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-951,
almota
farmers
elevator
against
the
united
states.
mr.
hickman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
the
lease
provide
with
respect
to
those
improvements
at
the
term
if
the
lease
is
not
renewed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
do
you
--
when
you
speak
of
the
value
of
those
improvements,
are
you
speaking
of
their
current
use
value
or
their
salvage
value
to
the
lessee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
have
a
right
to
use
them
under
the
lease
for
seven
more
years
approximately.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
now
taken.
you
said
the
government
did
not
acquire
the
fee
to
the
3/4
acre
of
land.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
railroad
somewhere
toward
the
end
of
the
seven
years
remaining
in
the
lease
decided
for
their
own
reasons
to
move
the
track
to
high
ground
if
in
case
of
flooding
or
move
it
anywhere
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
buyer
or
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
a
risk?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
a
risk
that
your
client
took
when
he
built
the
property
on
that
land
under
that
lease?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
most
of
these
buildings
put
up
since
1954
or
a
large
portion
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
most
expensive
piece
i
suppose
is
the
concrete
tank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it’s
the
one
on
which
you
have
the
lease
salvage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
of
it
really?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
this
perhaps
the
explanation
why
the
earlier
leases
were
five
years
for
example
and
the
final
lease
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
a
prudent
business
man
in
1954
go
to
the
expensive
building
that
concrete
tank
if
he
had
only
a
five-year
lease?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that’s
not
quite
the
question
i
was
driving
at.
would
a
prudent
man
build
an
expensive
concrete
tank
on
which
there
be
no
salvage
or
portable
value
on
land
on
which
he
had
a
five-year
lease
or
would
he
want
something
more
than
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
he
got
a
20-year
lease
the
last
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
hickman.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
court
used
the
language
the
right
to
use
the
--
to
renew
the
lease
of
petty,
do
you
say
the
court
meant
a
right
which
is
a
legal
right
enforceable
under
some
option?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
preference
is
not
to
expectancy
or
hope
or
custom
of
renewing
the
lease
independent
of
some
option
to
renew,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
necessarily
be
true
if
they
acquire
that
20-year
extension
after
notice
of
the
taking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
should
we
weigh
that
circumstance?
the
record
before
us
is
no
taking,
is
it
not?
the
exchange
was
never
consummated
so
far
as
this
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
taking
was
effective
as
of
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
money
deposited
in
the
usual
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
monthly
deposit,
it
is
the
130,000
or
the
smaller
of
the
two
stipulated
in
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
back
up
that
mr.
frizzell.
on
may
26,
1967
is
that
the
date
of
taking
of
the
leasehold
interest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
of
record
and
in
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
as
of
that
date,
the
title
passed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
leasehold
interest,
whatever
is
valued
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
frizzell.
you
have
four
minutes
remaining
mr.
hickman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
seven
or
7-1/2
years
used?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that’s
what
you
said
earlier
didn’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
quotation
you
read
from
directed
primarily
at
the
highest
and
best
used
concept?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
that
really
make
mr.
hickman
when
there
was
a
separate
taking
of
the
leasehold
interest
in
1967,
a
proceeding
directed
only
at
your
client
and
at
the
interest
of
your
client
which
was
then7-1/2
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
cares
in
other
words
where
the
fee
title
was
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
what
justice
white
was
suggesting
to
you,
wasn’t
it
in
his
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
