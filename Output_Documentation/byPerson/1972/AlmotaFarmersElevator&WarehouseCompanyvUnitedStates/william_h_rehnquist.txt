justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hickman,
there
is
no
dispute
is
there
that
upon
the
government’s
taking,
your
client
is
obligated
to
sever
the
improvements
that
he
can’t
leave
them
in
place
and
continue
to
use
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
while
in
the
condemnation
vested
full
right
in
the
government,
did
it
not
subject
to
the
obligation
to
pay
just
compensation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
said
that
the
government
couldn’t
insist
under
the
way
it
took
the
land
that
you
remove
those
buildings
just
because
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frizzell,
you
refer
to
this
holding
and
petty
as
to
the
expectancies
of
a
tenant
for
years.
if
that
was
such
an
important
holding,
why
is
it
just
in
a
footnote?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
but
i
mean
there
was
a
footnote
in
petty
as
i
read
petty.
it
isn’t
in
the
body
of
the
opinion.
it’s
a
footnote
on
page
380.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
types
of
damages
were
being
referred
to
under
the
head
of
consequential
damages
mr.
justice
douglas’s
opinion
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
theory
mr.
hickman,
could
a
witness
testify
that
condemnation
--
the
valuation
hearing
that
your
client
have
had
a
falling
out
with
the
railroad
and
therefore
in
this
particular
case
it
was
very
unlikely
that
the
lease
would
be
renewed?
