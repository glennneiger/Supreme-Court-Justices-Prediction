mr.
kent
frizzell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
discuss
two
or
three
essential
matters
with
you
if
i
may.
first,
let
us
establish
that
if
we
were
to
adopt
appellant’s
position
in
viewpoint
urged
upon
us,
it
will
necessarily
and
clearly
dictate
and
require
that
his
court
overrule
the
establish
law
of
just
compensation
as
set
forth
26
years
ago
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
petty
motor
company.
secondly,
i’d
like
to
share
with
you
why
the
rule
as
enunciated
in
petty
is
the
proper
rule
and
thereby
why
it
should
not
be
set
aside
and
overruled.
and
lastly,
i’d
like
to
deal
with
some
of
the
specific
arguments
in
questions
raised
by
petitioner
almota.
let’s
turn
our
attention
if
we
may
then,
the
united
states
versus
petty
motor
company
case
cited
in
our
brief.
this
court
in
petty
held
that
a
tenants
expectancy
that
its
leasehold
would
be
renewed
upon
expiration
even
though
its
lease
did
not
provide
for
renewal
is
not
a
compensable
element
of
value
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
further
held
that
each
tenant
in
that
case
was
entitled
the
compensation
measured
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
remainder
of
its
term
which
existed
after
its
ouster.
this
court
said,
the
fact
that
some
tenants
had
occupied
their
leaseholds
by
mutual
concept
for
long
periods
of
years
does
not
add
to
their
rights.
now,
the
question
arises
is
petty
binding
in
this
case
or
is
it
distinguishable.
petitioner
contends
that
it
is
distinguishable
and
therefore
isn’t
binding.
i
submit
that
the
petty
motor
case
is
directly
in
point
despite
the
efforts
of
petitioners
to
distinguish
it.
in
substance
the
facts
are
the
same.
the
difference
is
pointed
out
by
appellant
and
that
difference
is
as
follows.
he
says
“well
after
all,
the
tenants
in
the
petty
case
add
no
improvements
considered
part
of
the
fee
as
is
present
in
the
instant
case.”
but
that
does
not
change
the
legal
principles
involved,
they
are
identical.
this
court
in
petty
held
that
the
possibility
of
renewal
is
not
a
compensable
element
and
made
clear
that
this
was
because
such
a
prospect
of
a
renewal
expectancy
does
not
add
to
the
tenants
rights
with
or
without
improvements.
generally,
the
only
value
that
any
buildings
have
to
be
used
in
connection
with
leasehold
interest
is
their
use
in
place.
we
are
willing
to
pay
the
petitioner
here
for
the
buildings
and
their
use
in
place
for
the
remaining
term
of
the
lease.
but
we’re
not
willing
to
pay
petitioner
based
on
the
speculation
or
the
mere
expectation
of
those
buildings
in
place
where
there
is
no
renewal
of
the
lease
--
renewal
of
the
lease
containing
in
that
lease
but
a
mere
expectation.
the
decision
in
petty
was
based
upon
pure
property
law.
basically
it
wasn’t
decided
with
any
controlling
considerations
a
fairness
or
lack
of
fairness.
i
submit
that
in
many
instances,
condemnation
law
is
harsh
law.
in
the
instant
case,
the
government
admits
that
the
renewal
expectancy
is
there
and
it
is
true
that
such
expectancy
has
been
frustrated
by
the
government
taking.
this
occurs
frequently.
it
occurs
with
frustration
of
contract
rights.
it
occurs
with
frustration
of
business
profits
but
the
remedy
if
desired
should
lie
with
congress.
mr.
kent
frizzell
we
discussed
it
in
our
brief
further
than
merely
in
a
footnote.
mr.
kent
frizzell
i’m
sorry.
mr.
justice
i
was
reading
when
i
shouldn’t
have
been
listening.
mr.
kent
frizzell
may
i,
mr.
justice,
may
i
bring
your
attention
to
page
381,
the
page
following
the
footnote
that
you
refer
to.
there,
the
last
sentence
recites
the
major
of
damages
is
the
value
of
the
use
and
occupancy
of
the
leasehold
for
the
remainder
of
the
tenants
term
plus
the
value
of
the
right
to
renew
in
the
lease
of
petty
less
the
agreed
rent
which
the
tenant
would
pay
for
such
use
in
occupancy.
mr.
kent
frizzell
and
that
was
the
instance
with
that
one
defendant
in
petty.
there
was
a
renewal
right
in
that
particular
instance.
mr.
kent
frizzell
not
at
all.
nor
allow
that
mere
expectancy
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
legal
property
right
or
interest
and
that
squarely
what
petty
held,
that
you
can’t
allow
mere
expectancy,
a
right,
a
hope,
of
a
renewal
of
a
lease
to
raise
to
the
status
of
a
legal
compensable
right
under
condemnation.
now,
what
are
the
alternatives?
if
we
stay
with
the
decision
in
petty,
congress
can
go
either
way.
if
we
reverse
petty,
we
freeze
into
the
constitution,
one
rigid
concept
that
may
be
just
in
one
case
but
will
likely
result
and
inflame
in
sole
and
verdicts
and
hundreds
of
others.
we’re
not
making
law
for
a
particular
case
but
for
the
whole
range
or
eminent
domain
cases.
when
you
look
at
petitioner’s
argument
realistically,
shift
and
sift
the
chaff
from
the
wheat.
it’s
appealing
on
the
surface
but
it
is
in
truth
and
fact
one
of
form
over
substance,
it
is
i
submit
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
convert
a
non-property
right,
the
renewal
expectancy
into
a
compensable
interest.
they’re
asking
the
court
to
rewrite
the
lease
with
the
railroad
for
them
and
insert
therein
a
compensable
legal
right,
a
right
of
renewal
in
the
lease
with
the
railroad.
in
effect
what,
they’re
asking
is
that
the
court,
that
this
court
amend
the
constitution
and
make
the
fifth
amendment
read
nor
shall
private
property
nor
reasonable
expectations
be
taken
without
just
compensation.
mr.
kent
frizzell
not
at
all,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
mr.
kent
frizzell
i
am
not
your
honor.
mr.
kent
frizzell
an
easement
would
be
a
legal
interest
properly
compensation.
mr.
kent
frizzell
let’s
turn
our
attention
because
it’s
a
logical
question
and
a
logical
interest
to
take
and
that
is
how
does
the
government
justify
the
petitioner
in
this
instance
getting
something
less
than
the
$274,000.
in
fact
the
petitioner
repeats
that
in
his
brief
several
times
and
he
says
anything
less
than
that
is
not
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
well,
first
of
all
let
me
point
out
that
a
$130,000
of
that
$274,000
represents
compensation
to
the
petitioner
for
its
remaining
7-1/2
years
under
the
lease.
now,
the
reason
petitioner
gets
less
than
the
full
$274,000
is
because
the
remaining
$144,625
is
not
part
of
the
value
of
the
leasehold
owned
by
petitioner
and
condemned
with
the
government.
that
much
of
the
$274,000
represents
value
that
petitioner
desires
to
add-on
based
on
the
mere
expectancy
i.e.
renewal
of
its
lease.
a
non-property
expectation
and
i
hear
some
add
that
the
lease
would
be
renewed.
if
the
government
were
to
pay
almota
for
such
expectancy,
we
would
be
acquiescing
in
their
attempt
to
convert
a
non-property
interest
into
a
compensable
item.
why
should
the
government
be
put
in
a
different
position
than
any
other
private
fee
owner
that
would
have
acquired
the
fee
in
this
instance?
why
should
we
be
paid
--
required
to
pay
more
than
united
states
deal
or
g.e.
had
they
acquired
the
railroad
fee
here?
what
would
have
happened
if
they
would
have
acquired
rather
than
the
government
and
we’ve
got
to
remember
that
the
government
under
the
case
law
should
pay
no
more
for
public
purpose
in
condemnation
of
property
then
private
interest
would
pay.
g.e.
owns
this
thing
now,
they
have
two
options.
they
can
set
the7-1/2
years
out
under
the
lease
and
pay
absolutely
nothing,
so
could
the
government.
we
could
have
acquired
the
fee
from
the
railroad,
set
out
7-1/2
years
and
we
wouldn’t
have
owned
--
owed
one
cent
to
petitioner.
or
g.e.
could
say
to
the
petitioner,
“look,
we
like
to
build
7-1/2
years
before
your
lease
expires.”
what
would
g.e.
have
paid
for
the
remaining
term
of
that
lease?
would
they
have
paid
for
an
expectancy
of
the
lease
renewal?
no
indeed
nor
should
the
government
be
required
to
do
so.
petitioners
assume
the
risk
when
they
sign
that
lease
20
years
ago
almost
in
1954
and
they
now
want
to
transfer
that
risk
to
the
government
and
have
us
pay
for
it.
it
is
not
a
legally
recognized
right
in
the
property
and
therefore
is
not
compensable
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
i
should
deal
directly
with
some
of
the
petitioners
prompts
the
other
day.
he
said
“well
after
all
under
washington
new
law
between
the
lesser
and
lessee,
the
property,
the
improvements
is
considered
personal
thing.”
but
when
the
government
condemns,
it’s
considered
real
estate.
members
of
this
court,
we
value.
we,
the
government
value
the
improvements
as
real
estate
for
the
remaining
term
of
the
lease
that
is
7-1/2
years.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
had
they
in
fact
acquired
more
than
7-1/2
year
lease,
20-year,
whatever,
we
would
have
had
to
pay
them
for
their
legal
interest
in
the
property
condemned
the
leasehold
interest
but
not
any
expectancy.
mr.
kent
frizzell
no.
that
would
not
be
true
in
that
event
because
the
compensation
to
be
paid
is
as
off
the
date
of
taking
and
the
interest
taken
as
of
that
date
not
subsequently
acquired
by
petitioner
through
its
own
efforts
with
the
railroad.
to
answer
a
question
that
came
up
earlier,
what
really
happened
here,
its
true
that
in
these
type
of
situations,
the
government
generally
relocates
the
railroad
and
they
exchange
these
as
of
the
date
of
taking
in
this
instance
those
deeds
had
not
been
exchanged.
that’s
why
he
says
as
of
the
date
of
taking
we
don’t
disagree
as
of
the
date
of
taking.
the
government
didn’t
actually
have
possession
of
the
exchange
deed
from
the
railroad.
mr.
kent
frizzell
no,
sir.
mr.
kent
frizzell
i
think
not.
mr.
kent
frizzell
that
is
not
in
the
record.
no,
sir.
our
position
on
the
government
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
government
owned
the
fee
on
the
date
of
taking
or
whether
the
railroad
did.
we,
in
fact
have
settled
with
the
railroad.
they’re
not
a
party
to
this
action.
it
was
settled
before
the
necessity
of
filing
condemnation
proceedings
arose.
that
only
left
us
with
the
obligation
to
acquire
the
remaining
interest
of
petitioners.
the
leasehold
interest
and
we
did
in
fact
in
may
of
1967
file
that
condemnation
proceeding
to
obtain
the
remaining
legal
interest
in
the
property.
mr.
kent
frizzell
as
of
that
date.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
frizzell
the
specific
information
i
have
here
mr.
justice.
this
declaration
of
taking
in
the
almota
case
was
may
26,
1967
as
set
out
in
the
brief.
there
was
a
direct
answer
to
your
question,
a
relocation
contract
between
the
government
and
the
railroad
and
it
is
dated
august
30,
1966.
the
deeds
were
not
exchanged
however
between
the
railroad
and
the
government
under
the
relocation
contract
as
of
the
date
of
taking,
as
of
the
circuit
court
or
ninth
circuit
hearing.
mr.
kent
frizzell
no,
sir.
it
is
not.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
indeed
it
is.
mr.
kent
frizzell
as
between
petitioner
and
the
government,
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
whatever
that
interest
is,
whatever
its
value
is
passed
to
the
government
as
of
may
of
1967
leaving
a
remaining
approximately
7-1/2
year
term
for
the
government
to
compensate
petitioner
for
under
his
original
20-year
lease
dating
back
to
1954
and
expiring
in
1974.
i
think
one
other
point
that
the
petitioner
made
should
be
cleared
up
this
time
and
that
is
the
statement
that
the
government
is
only
in
essence
allowing
junk
value
for
these
improvements.
i
refer
you
to
our
brief
but
let
me
point
out
again
that
the
value
of
improvements
at
the
end
of
the
term
of
this
lease
is
not
any
longer
an
issue
in
this
case.
why?
because
by
stipulation
here
again,
a
lot
were
stipulated
too
in
this
case,
one
of
those
stipulations
was
that
the
right
of
removal
under
the
lease
was
re-vested
by
the
government
in
petitioner
giving
him
the
exact
same
rights
he
had
under
the
original
lease
with
the
railroad
and
giving
him
ample
time
to
remove
the
improvements.
i
think
in
conclusion
--
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
i
would
submit
that
that
would
generally
be
true
with
most
permanent
type
of
improvements
after
13
years
since
their
--
this
were
erected
in
1940,
some
of
them
i
think
is
said.
after
approximately
27
years,
the
removal
right
is
somewhat
of
an
empty
gesture.
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
this
lease
provided
by
the
way
that
if
petitioner
didn’t
remove
them
that
the
railroad
had
the
right
to
do
so
and
charge
petitioner.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes,
as
we
exceed
to
the
rights
of
the
fee
railroad
owner.
mr.
kent
frizzell
well,
we
and
i
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
fuller
case
but
of
course
as
you
well
know
since
it’s
just
been
argued
that
is
different
to
the
extent
that
in
that
instance
the
expectancy
was
based
on
a
license
revocable
by
the
government
whereas
in
this
instance,
there
was
no
renewal
right
in
the
lease
but
a
mere
expectancy
that
petitioner
desires
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
legal
interest
in
the
lease
and
therefore
be
compensated.
i
would
like
to
conclude
and
i
can
think
of
no
more
fitting
conclusions
for
argument
in
this
case,
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
douglas
concurring
in
part
in
united
states
versus
general
motors
company.
at
that
time,
he
stated
“consequential
losses
or
injuries
resulting
from
the
taking
are
not
compensable
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
if
we
allow
consequential
damages
to
be
shown
here
and
awarded
here,
i
do
not
see
why
almost
any
type
might
not
be
in
the
future.
if
we
take
that
step,
we
demonstrate
that
hard
cases
do
indeed
make
bad
law.
we
give
the
constitution
an
interpretation
which
promises
whole
in
verdicts
which
no
act
of
congress
can
cure.
mr.
kent
frizzell
that
was
an
instance
where
general
motors
corporation
desired
to
remove
leasehold
improvements
in
the
matter
of
machinery
and
buildings.
mr.
kent
frizzell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
discuss
two
or
three
essential
matters
with
you
if
i
may.
first,
let
us
establish
that
if
we
were
to
adopt
appellant’s
position
in
viewpoint
urged
upon
us,
it
will
necessarily
and
clearly
dictate
and
require
that
his
court
overrule
the
establish
law
of
just
compensation
as
set
forth
26
years
ago
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
petty
motor
company.
secondly,
i’d
like
to
share
with
you
why
the
rule
as
enunciated
in
petty
is
the
proper
rule
and
thereby
why
it
should
not
be
set
aside
and
overruled.
and
lastly,
i’d
like
to
deal
with
some
of
the
specific
arguments
in
questions
raised
by
petitioner
almota.
let’s
turn
our
attention
if
we
may
then,
the
united
states
versus
petty
motor
company
case
cited
in
our
brief.
this
court
in
petty
held
that
a
tenants
expectancy
that
its
leasehold
would
be
renewed
upon
expiration
even
though
its
lease
did
not
provide
for
renewal
is
not
a
compensable
element
of
value
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
further
held
that
each
tenant
in
that
case
was
entitled
the
compensation
measured
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
remainder
of
its
term
which
existed
after
its
ouster.
this
court
said,
the
fact
that
some
tenants
had
occupied
their
leaseholds
by
mutual
concept
for
long
periods
of
years
does
not
add
to
their
rights.
now,
the
question
arises
is
petty
binding
in
this
case
or
is
it
distinguishable.
petitioner
contends
that
it
is
distinguishable
and
therefore
isn’t
binding.
i
submit
that
the
petty
motor
case
is
directly
in
point
despite
the
efforts
of
petitioners
to
distinguish
it.
in
substance
the
facts
are
the
same.
the
difference
is
pointed
out
by
appellant
and
that
difference
is
as
follows.
he
says
“well
after
all,
the
tenants
in
the
petty
case
add
no
improvements
considered
part
of
the
fee
as
is
present
in
the
instant
case.”
but
that
does
not
change
the
legal
principles
involved,
they
are
identical.
this
court
in
petty
held
that
the
possibility
of
renewal
is
not
a
compensable
element
and
made
clear
that
this
was
because
such
a
prospect
of
a
renewal
expectancy
does
not
add
to
the
tenants
rights
with
or
without
improvements.
generally,
the
only
value
that
any
buildings
have
to
be
used
in
connection
with
leasehold
interest
is
their
use
in
place.
we
are
willing
to
pay
the
petitioner
here
for
the
buildings
and
their
use
in
place
for
the
remaining
term
of
the
lease.
but
we’re
not
willing
to
pay
petitioner
based
on
the
speculation
or
the
mere
expectation
of
those
buildings
in
place
where
there
is
no
renewal
of
the
lease
--
renewal
of
the
lease
containing
in
that
lease
but
a
mere
expectation.
the
decision
in
petty
was
based
upon
pure
property
law.
basically
it
wasn’t
decided
with
any
controlling
considerations
a
fairness
or
lack
of
fairness.
i
submit
that
in
many
instances,
condemnation
law
is
harsh
law.
in
the
instant
case,
the
government
admits
that
the
renewal
expectancy
is
there
and
it
is
true
that
such
expectancy
has
been
frustrated
by
the
government
taking.
this
occurs
frequently.
it
occurs
with
frustration
of
contract
rights.
it
occurs
with
frustration
of
business
profits
but
the
remedy
if
desired
should
lie
with
congress.
mr.
kent
frizzell
we
discussed
it
in
our
brief
further
than
merely
in
a
footnote.
mr.
kent
frizzell
i’m
sorry.
mr.
justice
i
was
reading
when
i
shouldn’t
have
been
listening.
mr.
kent
frizzell
may
i,
mr.
justice,
may
i
bring
your
attention
to
page
381,
the
page
following
the
footnote
that
you
refer
to.
there,
the
last
sentence
recites
the
major
of
damages
is
the
value
of
the
use
and
occupancy
of
the
leasehold
for
the
remainder
of
the
tenants
term
plus
the
value
of
the
right
to
renew
in
the
lease
of
petty
less
the
agreed
rent
which
the
tenant
would
pay
for
such
use
in
occupancy.
mr.
kent
frizzell
and
that
was
the
instance
with
that
one
defendant
in
petty.
there
was
a
renewal
right
in
that
particular
instance.
mr.
kent
frizzell
not
at
all.
nor
allow
that
mere
expectancy
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
legal
property
right
or
interest
and
that
squarely
what
petty
held,
that
you
can’t
allow
mere
expectancy,
a
right,
a
hope,
of
a
renewal
of
a
lease
to
raise
to
the
status
of
a
legal
compensable
right
under
condemnation.
now,
what
are
the
alternatives?
if
we
stay
with
the
decision
in
petty,
congress
can
go
either
way.
if
we
reverse
petty,
we
freeze
into
the
constitution,
one
rigid
concept
that
may
be
just
in
one
case
but
will
likely
result
and
inflame
in
sole
and
verdicts
and
hundreds
of
others.
we’re
not
making
law
for
a
particular
case
but
for
the
whole
range
or
eminent
domain
cases.
when
you
look
at
petitioner’s
argument
realistically,
shift
and
sift
the
chaff
from
the
wheat.
it’s
appealing
on
the
surface
but
it
is
in
truth
and
fact
one
of
form
over
substance,
it
is
i
submit
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
convert
a
non-property
right,
the
renewal
expectancy
into
a
compensable
interest.
they’re
asking
the
court
to
rewrite
the
lease
with
the
railroad
for
them
and
insert
therein
a
compensable
legal
right,
a
right
of
renewal
in
the
lease
with
the
railroad.
in
effect
what,
they’re
asking
is
that
the
court,
that
this
court
amend
the
constitution
and
make
the
fifth
amendment
read
nor
shall
private
property
nor
reasonable
expectations
be
taken
without
just
compensation.
mr.
kent
frizzell
not
at
all,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
mr.
kent
frizzell
i
am
not
your
honor.
mr.
kent
frizzell
an
easement
would
be
a
legal
interest
properly
compensation.
mr.
kent
frizzell
let’s
turn
our
attention
because
it’s
a
logical
question
and
a
logical
interest
to
take
and
that
is
how
does
the
government
justify
the
petitioner
in
this
instance
getting
something
less
than
the
$274,000.
in
fact
the
petitioner
repeats
that
in
his
brief
several
times
and
he
says
anything
less
than
that
is
not
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
well,
first
of
all
let
me
point
out
that
a
$130,000
of
that
$274,000
represents
compensation
to
the
petitioner
for
its
remaining
7-1/2
years
under
the
lease.
now,
the
reason
petitioner
gets
less
than
the
full
$274,000
is
because
the
remaining
$144,625
is
not
part
of
the
value
of
the
leasehold
owned
by
petitioner
and
condemned
with
the
government.
that
much
of
the
$274,000
represents
value
that
petitioner
desires
to
add-on
based
on
the
mere
expectancy
i.e.
renewal
of
its
lease.
a
non-property
expectation
and
i
hear
some
add
that
the
lease
would
be
renewed.
if
the
government
were
to
pay
almota
for
such
expectancy,
we
would
be
acquiescing
in
their
attempt
to
convert
a
non-property
interest
into
a
compensable
item.
why
should
the
government
be
put
in
a
different
position
than
any
other
private
fee
owner
that
would
have
acquired
the
fee
in
this
instance?
why
should
we
be
paid
--
required
to
pay
more
than
united
states
deal
or
g.e.
had
they
acquired
the
railroad
fee
here?
what
would
have
happened
if
they
would
have
acquired
rather
than
the
government
and
we’ve
got
to
remember
that
the
government
under
the
case
law
should
pay
no
more
for
public
purpose
in
condemnation
of
property
then
private
interest
would
pay.
g.e.
owns
this
thing
now,
they
have
two
options.
they
can
set
the7-1/2
years
out
under
the
lease
and
pay
absolutely
nothing,
so
could
the
government.
we
could
have
acquired
the
fee
from
the
railroad,
set
out
7-1/2
years
and
we
wouldn’t
have
owned
--
owed
one
cent
to
petitioner.
or
g.e.
could
say
to
the
petitioner,
“look,
we
like
to
build
7-1/2
years
before
your
lease
expires.”
what
would
g.e.
have
paid
for
the
remaining
term
of
that
lease?
would
they
have
paid
for
an
expectancy
of
the
lease
renewal?
no
indeed
nor
should
the
government
be
required
to
do
so.
petitioners
assume
the
risk
when
they
sign
that
lease
20
years
ago
almost
in
1954
and
they
now
want
to
transfer
that
risk
to
the
government
and
have
us
pay
for
it.
it
is
not
a
legally
recognized
right
in
the
property
and
therefore
is
not
compensable
under
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
i
should
deal
directly
with
some
of
the
petitioners
prompts
the
other
day.
he
said
“well
after
all
under
washington
new
law
between
the
lesser
and
lessee,
the
property,
the
improvements
is
considered
personal
thing.”
but
when
the
government
condemns,
it’s
considered
real
estate.
members
of
this
court,
we
value.
we,
the
government
value
the
improvements
as
real
estate
for
the
remaining
term
of
the
lease
that
is
7-1/2
years.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
had
they
in
fact
acquired
more
than
7-1/2
year
lease,
20-year,
whatever,
we
would
have
had
to
pay
them
for
their
legal
interest
in
the
property
condemned
the
leasehold
interest
but
not
any
expectancy.
mr.
kent
frizzell
no.
that
would
not
be
true
in
that
event
because
the
compensation
to
be
paid
is
as
off
the
date
of
taking
and
the
interest
taken
as
of
that
date
not
subsequently
acquired
by
petitioner
through
its
own
efforts
with
the
railroad.
to
answer
a
question
that
came
up
earlier,
what
really
happened
here,
its
true
that
in
these
type
of
situations,
the
government
generally
relocates
the
railroad
and
they
exchange
these
as
of
the
date
of
taking
in
this
instance
those
deeds
had
not
been
exchanged.
that’s
why
he
says
as
of
the
date
of
taking
we
don’t
disagree
as
of
the
date
of
taking.
the
government
didn’t
actually
have
possession
of
the
exchange
deed
from
the
railroad.
mr.
kent
frizzell
no,
sir.
mr.
kent
frizzell
i
think
not.
mr.
kent
frizzell
that
is
not
in
the
record.
no,
sir.
our
position
on
the
government
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
government
owned
the
fee
on
the
date
of
taking
or
whether
the
railroad
did.
we,
in
fact
have
settled
with
the
railroad.
they’re
not
a
party
to
this
action.
it
was
settled
before
the
necessity
of
filing
condemnation
proceedings
arose.
that
only
left
us
with
the
obligation
to
acquire
the
remaining
interest
of
petitioners.
the
leasehold
interest
and
we
did
in
fact
in
may
of
1967
file
that
condemnation
proceeding
to
obtain
the
remaining
legal
interest
in
the
property.
mr.
kent
frizzell
as
of
that
date.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
frizzell
the
specific
information
i
have
here
mr.
justice.
this
declaration
of
taking
in
the
almota
case
was
may
26,
1967
as
set
out
in
the
brief.
there
was
a
direct
answer
to
your
question,
a
relocation
contract
between
the
government
and
the
railroad
and
it
is
dated
august
30,
1966.
the
deeds
were
not
exchanged
however
between
the
railroad
and
the
government
under
the
relocation
contract
as
of
the
date
of
taking,
as
of
the
circuit
court
or
ninth
circuit
hearing.
mr.
kent
frizzell
no,
sir.
it
is
not.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
indeed
it
is.
mr.
kent
frizzell
as
between
petitioner
and
the
government,
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
whatever
that
interest
is,
whatever
its
value
is
passed
to
the
government
as
of
may
of
1967
leaving
a
remaining
approximately
7-1/2
year
term
for
the
government
to
compensate
petitioner
for
under
his
original
20-year
lease
dating
back
to
1954
and
expiring
in
1974.
i
think
one
other
point
that
the
petitioner
made
should
be
cleared
up
this
time
and
that
is
the
statement
that
the
government
is
only
in
essence
allowing
junk
value
for
these
improvements.
i
refer
you
to
our
brief
but
let
me
point
out
again
that
the
value
of
improvements
at
the
end
of
the
term
of
this
lease
is
not
any
longer
an
issue
in
this
case.
why?
because
by
stipulation
here
again,
a
lot
were
stipulated
too
in
this
case,
one
of
those
stipulations
was
that
the
right
of
removal
under
the
lease
was
re-vested
by
the
government
in
petitioner
giving
him
the
exact
same
rights
he
had
under
the
original
lease
with
the
railroad
and
giving
him
ample
time
to
remove
the
improvements.
i
think
in
conclusion
--
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
i
would
submit
that
that
would
generally
be
true
with
most
permanent
type
of
improvements
after
13
years
since
their
--
this
were
erected
in
1940,
some
of
them
i
think
is
said.
after
approximately
27
years,
the
removal
right
is
somewhat
of
an
empty
gesture.
yes.
mr.
kent
frizzell
this
lease
provided
by
the
way
that
if
petitioner
didn’t
remove
them
that
the
railroad
had
the
right
to
do
so
and
charge
petitioner.
mr.
kent
frizzell
yes,
as
we
exceed
to
the
rights
of
the
fee
railroad
owner.
mr.
kent
frizzell
well,
we
and
i
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
fuller
case
but
of
course
as
you
well
know
since
it’s
just
been
argued
that
is
different
to
the
extent
that
in
that
instance
the
expectancy
was
based
on
a
license
revocable
by
the
government
whereas
in
this
instance,
there
was
no
renewal
right
in
the
lease
but
a
mere
expectancy
that
petitioner
desires
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
legal
interest
in
the
lease
and
therefore
be
compensated.
i
would
like
to
conclude
and
i
can
think
of
no
more
fitting
conclusions
for
argument
in
this
case,
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
douglas
concurring
in
part
in
united
states
versus
general
motors
company.
at
that
time,
he
stated
“consequential
losses
or
injuries
resulting
from
the
taking
are
not
compensable
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
if
we
allow
consequential
damages
to
be
shown
here
and
awarded
here,
i
do
not
see
why
almost
any
type
might
not
be
in
the
future.
if
we
take
that
step,
we
demonstrate
that
hard
cases
do
indeed
make
bad
law.
we
give
the
constitution
an
interpretation
which
promises
whole
in
verdicts
which
no
act
of
congress
can
cure.
mr.
kent
frizzell
that
was
an
instance
where
general
motors
corporation
desired
to
remove
leasehold
improvements
in
the
matter
of
machinery
and
buildings.
