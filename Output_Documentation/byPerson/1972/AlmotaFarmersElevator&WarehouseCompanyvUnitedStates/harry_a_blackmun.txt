were
they
all
20-year
leases
or
varied?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i’m
confused
as
others
apparently
are.
what
did
the
government
--
why
did
it
take
just
the
leasehold
interest?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
by
trading
and
relocation.

mr.
hickman,
it
may
be
of
no
consequence
but
the
annual
rental
under
release
was
114.20
a
year?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
had
it
always
been
at
that
figure?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
a
typical
nominal
railroad
lease.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
frizzell.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
go
back
to
your
illustration.
you
said
the
government
could
have
acquired
the
fee
and
waited
7-1/2
years.
i
suppose
almota
could
have
gone
to
the
railroad
and
obtained
a
new
20-year
lease
and
you
would
have
had
to
pay
something
more.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
frizzell,
do
you
think
there
is
any
basic
inconsistency
between
the
ninth
circuit
decisions
in
this
case
and
in
the
fuller
case,
preceding
one?
