and
that
how
long
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
but
how?
justice
potter
stewart
and
had
there
been
lease
prior
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
1919
that’s
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
law
of
your
state,
are
those
improvements
part
of
the
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
--
well,
perhaps
you
enlighten
me.
i
--
certainly
the
court
just
didn’t
disregard
entirely
that
value
than
it
give
value
to
those
improvements
in
terms
of
their
salvage
value
at
the
termination
of
the
lease.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
who
was
the
trial
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
just
before
you
proceed,
if
the
government
had
first
acquired
the
fee,
you
would
hardly
have
any
case
at
all
would
you?
because
the
government
tells
them,
“i
am
your
lessor.”
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
that
in
turn,
that
difference
in
turn
in
valuation
depend
upon
whether
or
not
consideration
was
given
to
the
possibility
of
renewal
of
the
lease?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
had
the
government
acquired
the
fee
thereby
condemnation
or
negotiation,
it
would
have
been
certain
that
the
lease
would
not
have
been
renewed
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that’s
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
if
may
with
a
decision
to
this
court
had
cited

only
in
the
footnote
in
your
brief,
united
states
against
virginia
electric
and
power
company
in
volume
365
of
the
united
states
reports?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
the
valuation
of
an
easement
would
depend
upon
evaluating
the
likelihood
of
its
being
exercised.
and
that
is
not
certainly
very
far
away
from
evaluating
the
expectancy
of
at
least
being
renewed.
you
cited
for
different
point
for
a
dictum
in
passing
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
but
yes.
there’s
no
question
about
the
compensability
of
the
easement
nor
is
there
any
question
about
the
compensability
of
--
interpretation
of
this
property
in
this
case
but
in
evaluating
it.
the
evaluation
depended
upon
predictability
of
the
expectancy
of
its
being
exercised
and
that
as
i
say
is
not
maybe
far
away
from
the
petitioner’s
claim
here
evaluating
the
expectancy
or
the
probability
or
lack
of
it
of
the
lease
being
renewed.
but
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
the
case,
there
is
no
point
continuing
the
colloquy.
