mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
condemnation
action
to
acquire
the
leasehold
interest
of
the
almota
farmers
elevator
and
warehouse
company
in
a
track
of
land
required
for
the
little
goose
lock
and
dam
project,
a
corps
of
engineers
project
on
the
snake
river
in
eastern
washington.
the
fee
owner,
the
railroad
in
this
case
was
not
joined.
for
many
years,
the
owrnn
company
had
owned
and
operated
a
railroad
on
the
north
bank
of
the
snake
river
which
ran
through
the
little
village
of
almota.
the
almota
elevator
company
in
1919
went
to
the
railroad
and
they
leased
7,500
of
an
acre,
three
quarters
of
an
acre
of
bare
unimproved
land,
absolutely
nothing
on
it.
and
under
various
consecutive
leases
from
that
date
forward,
the
date
of
taking
on
may
26,
1967,
the
almota
company
continued
to
hold
this
lease.
at
the
time
of
the
taking,
they
held
under
a
20-year
lease
which
had
a
term
to
expire
on
october
12,
1974.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
the
date
of
taking
was
may
26,
1967.
it
was
to
expire
october
12,
1974.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
it
had
been
a
20-year
lease.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
oh!
yes,
there
had
been
various
short-term
leases
since
1919.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
consecutive,
continuous.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
no,
it
started
out
with
5-year
leases.
in
fact
the
20-year
lease
is
the
longest
lease
the
company
ever
had.
there
was
no
renewal
option
in
this
lease.
now
that’s
actually
what’s
involved
in
the
taking
in
this
case
and
if
it
was
only,
this
bare
unimproved
land
that
was
involved
here,
we
wouldn’t
have
any
problem
because
the
almota
company
isn’t
arguing
on
the
point
that
the
valuation
of
this
very
leasehold
is
its
use
value
for
the
length
of
the
term
remaining
on
the
lease
less
the
agreed
rent.
we
have
no
argument
over
that.
but
shortly
after
the
company
acquired
this
property,
in
1919
they
went
out
on
the
property
and
they
built
a
warehouse
on
this
property
to
handle
grain
and
some
years
afterwards,
they
built
three
crib
elevators
on
this
property
and
at
some
time
later,
it
put
up
a
concrete
tank
on
the
property.
now,
it’s
all
of
those
improvements
that
are
involved,
it
was
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
all
through
the
period
that
these
improvements
were
on
there.
these
improvements
under
the
terms
of
the
lease
and
the
treatment
of
the
parties
were
the
personal
property
of
the
elevator
company.
the
elevator
company
owned
these
improvements
and
it
had
the
right
to
take
the
improvements
at
the
end
of
the
term.
but
since
those
improvements
were
physically
a
part
of
this
land,
they
were
part
of
what
the
government
had
to
take
in
this
condemnation
action.
now
the
real
problem
as
we
see
it
here
in
this
matter
is
the
valuation
of
these
improvements.
not
the
valuation
of
this
very
leasehold.
there’s
a
basic
difference
here
in
the
duration
of
almota’s
property
interest
in
this
basic
leasehold
and
in
the
improvements
that’s
essential
to
understanding
of
this
case.
in
the
leasehold,
it’s
obvious
at
the
end
of
the
term,
the
reason
anything
there
left,
is
no
property
rights
to
value
but
the
improvements
at
the
end
of
the
term.
almota
still
own
those
improvements.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i’ll
get
to
that
point
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
--
in
just
a
moment.
what
i’m
pointing
out
now
is
that
there’s
a
difference
between
the
very
leasehold
and
the
improvements.
the
ninth
circuit
court
didn’t
appreciate
that.
in
the
one
case,
at
the
end
of
the
term
all
the
rights
were
extinguished.
in
the
other
case,
you’re
still
the
full
fee
owner
of
these
building
improvements
for
their
full
lifetime
as
long
as
they
exist.
what
you
do
with
them,
that’s
part
of
the
valuation
problem.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
for
the
purpose
of
what
the
government
has
to
take,
the
seagren
case
cited
in
our
opening
brief
says,
they
are
part
of
the
real
estate
but
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington
and
we
cited
authority
for
that.
they
are
the
personal
property
of
the
tenant
and
you
have
a
very
confusing
situation
here.
the
government
is
taking
real
estate,
you
got
to
deal
with
this
real
estate
and
yet
what
the
tenant
actually
owns,
his
personal
property
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
value
it
and
his
ownership
continues
when
the
lease
is
up.
the
government
has
treated
this
as
so
we
have
no
further
rights
in
the
property
at
that
time.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that
is
the
argument
of
the
government.
i
would
like
to
get
an
answer
to
that
later
and
if
i
don’t
i’d
appreciate
going
back
to
that
again.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
judge
powell
in
the
district
court
in
spokane.
in
other
words,
the
valuation
of
these
improvements
at
the
end
of
the
term
of
the
lease
or
at
the
time
of
the
taking
is
vastly
different
than
the
manner
of
the
valuation
of
the
bare
leasehold
itself
where
the
rights
are
limited
by
the
duration
of
the
term.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
he
had
no
legal
right
to
continue
to
use
them
in
place.
on
the
other
hand,
i’d
like
to
make
equally
clear
that
the
government
own
no
legal
right
to
determine
that
the
company
could
not
use
them
in
place.
this
is
not
like
the
fuller
case
where
it’s
a
revocable
permit.
the
government
did
not
own
the
fee
at
the
time
of
the
taking.
the
oregon
washington
railroad
navigation
company
owned
this
fee.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that
is
right.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
yes,
the
vested
full
right
in
the
leasehold
and
the
improvements
but
mind,
the
government
did
not
condemn
the
rights
of
the
fee
owner.
this
was
still
property
of
the
fee
owner
and
only
the
fee
owner
could
terminate
this
lease
and
refuse
to
renew.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
the
government
had
no
right
to
insist
because
the
government
was
not
acquiring
the
fee.
this
isn’t
like
the
fuller
case
in
that
respect
where
the
government
could
have
said
we
have
a
legal
right
and
at
the
end
of
the
term
you’re
just
not
going
to
stay
there.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
no,
the
fee
owner
was
not
joined
in
this
case.
and
so
far
as
i
know
that
this
date,
the
government
still
does
not
own
the
fee
to
this
property.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
of
course
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record.
what
i
can
inform
you
that
is
the
policy
of
the
government
and
these
relocation
cases
where
they
relocate
the
railroad
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
railroad
and
they
do
not
acquire
the
fee
they
trade.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
the
time
this
was
done,
no
such
agreement
existed
with
the
railroad.
this
has
to
be
considered
as
the
facts
were
at
the
time.
that
they
did
not
own
the
fee,
the
railroad
did
own
the
fee
and
that’s
very
important
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
for
the
little
goose
lock
and
dam
project,
it
would
be
flooded.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
they
expected
to
acquire
the
fee
by
making
a
deal
with
the
railroad
but
they
hadn’t
made
the
deal
yet.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
right.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
right,
they
relocated
the
railroad
higher
up
on
the
hill
and
went
ahead.
now,
there
wasn’t
any
substantial
factual
dispute
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
you
because
the
government
then
would
have
had
the
right
at
the
end
of
term
to
say,
“sorry
boys,
we’re
not
going
to
renew
but
the
thing
is
we
have
to
take
the
facts
in
this
case
as
they
are.”
the
government
didn’t
do
that.
and
in
the
stipulation
that’s
entered
here
and
we
did
enter
into
a
stipulation
for
the
reason
that
the
only
difference
between
this
ultimately
was
how
do
you
value
these
improvements.
so
we
simply
got
together
and
we
stipulated
on
the
facts.
and
if
it
was
to
be
valued
as
determined
by
the
government,
the
value
is
set
to
be
a
$130,000.
if
it
was
to
be
valued,
the
way
we
contended,
it
was
to
be
$274,625.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
actually,
it
ultimately
boils
down
to
that.
but
i’d
like
to
get
at
it
in
a
little
bit
different
way
there.
in
both
cases,
on
both
valuation,
stipulated
values,
it
was
the
same
property
involved.
i
want
you
to
understand
that
because
there
are
some
contentions
in
here
in
the
argument
of
the
government
in
the
brief
that
would
lead
you
to
the
contrary
but
the
stipulation
was
the
value
of
the
land
and
the
improvements.
that
is
the
leasehold
and
improvements,
in
the
one
case
it
was
a
130
and
the
value
of
the
same
thing
and
the
other
was
264,000,
$274,625.00.
now
we
get
really
to
the
tracks
of
the
thing
and
that
is
the
reason
for
this
difference
in
value
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
elements
of
value
were
entitled
to
be
considered
in
determining
the
value
of
these
improvements.
it
wasn’t
any
argument
over
this
very
leasehold.
now,
the
question
is
what
should
be
considered
when
it
comes
to
determining
the
value
of
these
improvements?
now
in
the
opening
brief,
we
cited
quite
a
number
of
cases
on
the
proposition
that
in
determining
the
fair
market
value
of
any
property
that
you
must
consider,
all
elements
of
value
you
must
consider
all
reasonable,
probable
uses
of
the
property
that
affect
the
very
market
value.
now,
they
don’t
disagree
with
that
but
they
don’t
apply
the
law
--
the
rule.
now
i
cited
the
olson
in
which
this
court
here
lays
down
in
very
good
language
exactly
what
i’ve
said
and
i
had
intended
to
read
it
but
in
the
interest
of
saving
time,
i
will
proceed.
now,
at
this
point
in
determining
what
these
buildings
can
be
used
for,
in
determining
what
the
elements
of
value
that
should
be
considered,
i
think
you
need
to
pretty
well
understand
the
structural
nature
of
these
facilities.
now,
i
mentioned
that
there
were
three
crib
buildings
that
were
put
up
on
the
property.
if
you
understand
what
a
crib
elevator
building
is,
it’s
a
wooden
structure,
it’s
made
of
cribbing,
we
take,
well
for
example
2
x
12
planks
and
a
spike
one
on
top
of
the
other.
and
you
continue
that
type
of
structure
clear
to
the
top
of
the
beams.
now,
each
one
of
these
structures
would
hold
125,000
bushels.
that’s
enough
to
fill
62-1/2,
120,000
capacity
grain
carts
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
size
of
this
thing.
now,
there
were
three
buildings
like
that.
to
top
that
of,
there
was
the
concrete
tank
which
would
hold148,000
bushels,
that
would
take
74
railroad
cars
at
the
same
size
to
fill
that.
now
you
can
realize
and
appreciate
that
there
had
to
be
very
substantial
and
permanent
foundations
under
these
structures.
so
when
you
get
to
the
matter
here
of
selling
this
property
and
determining
fair
market
value,
what’s
the
first
and
most
important
thing
the
buyer
is
going
to
ask?
he
is
going
to
ask
what
are
the
probabilities,
what
are
the
chances
of
continuing
to
use
these
structures
right
were
they
are.
why?
because
he
knows,
there
is
little
or
no
value
whatsoever
to
attempt
to
move
them,
probably
nothing
but
junk
value
to
try
and
move
these
buildings.
that’s
where
the
difference
arises
between
the
government
and
ourselves
in
this
case
and
that
is
in
almota’s
view
at
that
stage
of
the
case,
almota
has
contended
that
there
should
be
taken
into
consideration
that
the
probable
use
of
these
improvements
right
where
they
were
was
very
great
that
was
a
reasonably
probable
use
and
you’ll
find
in
the
stipulation
that
there
were
facts.
in
other
words,
it
was
stipulated
that
was
--
there
was
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
railroad
is
a
general
policy,
never
refuse
to
renew
one
of
these
leases
where
railroad
traffic
was
being
produced
for
the
railroad.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
risks
that
any
buyer
takes.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
you
buy
a
few
property
for
example
and
you
take
the
risks
that
the
party
between
you
and
the
view
might
build
a
high
rise
apartment.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
it
is
a
risk,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
yes
but
the
thing
is
your
honor
that
government
here
would
have
this
value
the
thought
was
a
certainty.
it
is
not
going
to
be
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
term.
we
say
that
it
was
reasonably
probable
that
it
would
be
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
term
and
that
that
is
an
element
of
value
that’s
considered
by
the
market
and
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
this
case
and
with
the
statute
stipulation.
that
was
actually
the
case
because
that’s
the
only
difference
between
the
two
values.
the
government
recognizes
that
the
market
was
valuing
this
probability
for
renewal
and
approximately
a
$144,625
because
that’s
the
only
difference
between
the
two
values.
they
recognized
that
if
you
let
a
buyer
use
his
own
devices
in
determining
for
himself
what
the
probabilities
of
renewal
were
that
he’d
finally
and
hard
knows
bargaining
from
up
until
your
okay.
it’s
worth
$274,625.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
your
talking
of
a
problem
there
your
honor
that
doesn’t
apply
in
this
case,
there
was
no
condemnation
clause
in
the
lease
and
almota
in
this
case
by
--
is
entitled
to
the
full
value
of
these
structures,
whatever
it
may
be.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
now,
there’s
been
some
remarks
made
in
the
briefs
that
would
lead
you
to
the
contrary.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i
realize
that
that
is
in
the
opinion
and
there’s
been
some
contention
of
that
type
in
some
of
the
briefs.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
it’s
absolutely
no
truth
to
it.
that’s
an
erroneous
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
and
the
only
answer
--
i
mean
of
the
ninth
circuit
court.
the
only
answer
i
can
come
up
with
was
that
there
was
a
footnote
to
that
effect
in
one
of
the
government
briefs.
no
citation
has
ever
been
made,
anything
in
the
record
that
that
is
true
and
it
actually
is
not
factual.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that
did
not
happen
as
i
just
mentioned
to
you,
they
don’t
yet
own
the
fee.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
it
is.
it
is
but
it
was
tried
in
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
that
the
railroad
owned
this
property
and
the
government
did
not.
the
government
is
absolutely
not
in
the
position
in
this
case
to
held
out
till
1974
and
then
said,
“gentlemen,
we’re
not
renewing,
take
your
elevator
and
go.”
and
yet
that’s
what
they
would
do.
they
would
value
this
as
though
that
was
the
certain
result
at
the
end
of
the
term.
we
say
that
it’s
for
the
market
to
determine
what
the
probabilities
are
of
that
happening.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well
now
except
for
this
your
honor.
and
that
is,
i
don’t
think
it’s
exactly
the
law
and
it’s
not
in
here
and
hasn’t
argued.
you
know
when
we
ask
for
compensation,
we
can’t
ask
for
the
benefits
of
the
project
and
value.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
and
the
trial
judge
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
government
can’t
assert
the
detriments
of
it
either.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
in
other
words
that
they
have
got
to
take
the
title
as
it
was
at
the
time
they
are
taking
this
and
at
that
time
the
government
didn’t
own
it.
now,
you
see
where
this
renewal
of
the
lease
comes
in.
it
isn’t
really
renewal
of
the
lease.
it
comes
in,
in
determining
what
the
probabilities
are
that
at
the
end
of
this
term,
this
personal
property
continue,
can
continue
to
be
used
right
where
it
is.
if
it
can
continue
to
be
used
there,
it’s
of
great
value.
if
it
can’t
be,
it’s
probably
nothing
but
junk.
i
want
to
point
out
here
that
the
argument
the
government
has
made
here
actually
they’re
really
only
allowing
this
junk
value
for
this.
if
you
want
to
refer
to
that
charlotte
case
that’s
cited
in
the
brief
and
i
didn’t
cite
the
case
for
that
purpose
but
it
says
that
and
that
is
under
the
facts
there.
the
tenant
did
not
own
the
building
improvements.
yet,
and
that’s
the
washington
dc
circuit
case.
yet
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
owner
was
entitled
to
the
use
value
of
those
improvements
for
the
entire
period
of
the
lease.
now
here,
all
the
government
would
give
us
as
a
use
value
of
these
improvements
for
the
term.
i’m
pointing
out
that
in
the
charlotte
case,
the
court
has
held
we
can
get
that
without
owning
it.
now
all
that
the
government
would
give
us
in
addition
in
this
case
to
what
the
party
in
the
charlotte
case
got,
who
didn’t
own
the
improvements
is
they
give
us
this
junk
value
for
these
improvements.
what
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
a
concrete
tank
when
you
go
to
try
and
move
it
or
tear
it
down?
just
a
bunch
of
rubble,
that’s
all
and
that’s
all
they
allow
us
in
addition
to
what
was
allowed
the
owner
in
the
charlotte
case.
it’s
just
a
junk
value
of
these
improvements.
i
might
also
call
attention
that
we
are
only
arguing
and
have
only
argued
that
it
is
to
be
taken
into
consideration
only
the
probability
of
the
renewal
of
this
lease
at
the
end
of
the
term,
in
other
words,
the
probability
that
we
can
continue
to
use
it
there.
now,
i’ve
cited
the
brief
the
manhattan
case
and
the
upper
alleghany
case
second
circuit
cases.
those
cases
go
one
step
further
than
what
we
are
arguing
here.
they
would
have
it
valued
as
used
property
in
place
for
used
in
place
without
proving
any
probability
of
renewal.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
the
concrete
tank
was
put
up
about
1954
and
the
rest
have
been
put
up
about
1940
and
the
flat
house
about
1919.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
not
necessarily.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
there’s
no
salvage
to
that.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
really
not.
when
you
start
tearing
down
plank
spike
together,
i
leave
it
to
your
judgment
what
you’re
going
to
have
left.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i
think
not
your
honor.
it
simply
the
policy
the
railroad
to
want
to
control
these
properties
to
ensure
that
there’s
freight
going
to
the
railroad.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
your
honor,
that’s
just
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make.
prudent
businessman
and
you
got
to
assume
that
a
prudent
buyer,
you
got
to
assume
that
the
government
in
agreeing
to
this
$274,000
valuation
was
considering
a
prudent
buyer
willing
to
pay
that,
they’ve
admitted
that
buyers
on
the
market,
if
you
left
them
to
their
own
devices
and
let
them
be
examined
all
of
this
would
have
come
up
with
that
figure.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
he’d
want
something
more
than
that
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
he
would
do
it
with
the
railroad
and
the
type
of
lease
as
it
was
being
written
and
has
done
quite
regularly.
it’s
not
uncommon
at
all
and
the
reason
is
that
the
railroads
are
after
freight
traffic
and
don’t
continue
renewing
those
leases
time
after
time
allowed
any
question.
and
that’s
why
the
market
makes
a
difference
of
a
$144,625.
if
this
were
so
speculative
and
so
uncertain,
the
market
would
have
said,
well
we’ll
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
more.
and
that’s
all.
but
this
thing,
there’s
more
than
twice
the
difference
and
value
between
the
government’s
contention
and
our
own
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
right.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
here,
it
never
had
been
more
than
that.
i
suspected
it
may
have
been
a
little
less
at
one
time.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
right,
that’s
right.
the
railroad
saves
these
properties
for
justice
purpose
and
they
continue
to
lease
them,
the
only
thing
they
want
to
control
out
is
that
if
the
lessee
goes
to
doing
business
with
someone
else
and
doesn’t
produce
anymore
freight
traffic,
then
they
better
watch
out.
i
want
to
call
attention
that
the
government
has
gone
against
the
unit
rule
cases
and
they’re
against
in
conflict
with
the
second
circuit
cases,
the
washington
dc
circuit
case
in
our
opinion
is
in
line
with
the
second
circuit
although
it
doesn’t
specifically
so
state
and
they’re
also
in
conflict
with
a
statute
of
congress
that
was
enacted
in
the
first
part
of
1971
which
now
recognizes
that
just
compensation
is
more
than
what
the
government
is
arguing
in
this
case.
and
by
policy
of
the
congress
now
that
in
this
case,
they
would
award
the
full
value
that
those
improvements
add
to
the
whole
value
of
the
property.
i’d
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
you
please.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
mr.
chief
justice,
about
the
petty
case,
we’ve
dealt
with
that
at
length
in
the
briefs
and
the
preferences
made
to
that
i
think
that
the
matter
is
fully
answered.
but
again
i
repeat,
in
the
petty
case,
there
was
only
the
very
leasehold
to
value
in
that
case.
there
were
no
tenant
own
building
improvements.
the
court
didn’t
purport
to
be
talking
about
tenant
own
building
improvements
in
any
sense
whatsoever.
also,
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
that
counsel
and
in
the
briefs
has
argued
a
great
length
about
this
matter
of
property
rights.
the
only
property
rights
we’re
really
talking
about
in
this
case
is
the
very
leasehold
about
which
we
have
no
disagreement
and
the
building
improvements
and
machinery
that
were
disagreeing
about.
there
is
no
property
right
that
we
are
claiming
in
the
leasehold
expectancy.
we
haven’t
asked
for
payment
of
a
property
right
in
the
leasehold
expectancy.
what
we
do
say
is
that
in
the
valuation
of
those
building
improvements
that
we’re
entitled
to
the
consideration
of
all
elements
that
land
value
to
those
improvements
upon
the
market.
we
are
entitled
to
the
consideration
of
all
reasonably
probable
uses
of
that
property.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
not
limited
by
the
7-1/2
years
because
as
i
have
pointed
out,
at
the
end
of
the
7-1/2
years
we
still
own
these
buildings.
what
are
they
worth
then?
counsel
would
have
them
worth
nothing.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i
said
that
if
you
took
their
view
they
would
be
worth
nothing.
under
our
view
considering
all
elements
of
value
and
the
fact
that
in
all
probability,
they
could
continue
to
be
used
in
place.
they
have
great
value
in
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
because
of
the
probability
of
continuing
to
use
them
right
where
they
are.
what
are
you
going
to
use
those
buildings
for
at
the
end
of
the
term?
counsel
would
say
there
is
only
one
use
you
can
consider
and
that’s
to
tear
them
down
and
move
them.
but
the
market
says,
look,
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
we
can
use
them
right
where
we
are.
this
court
in
the
alton
cases
said,
all
reasonable
probabilities
are
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
the
court
says
in
making
that
estimate,
there
should
taken
into
account
all
considerations
that
might
be
brought
forward
and
reasonably
the
given
substantial
weight
in
such
bargaining.
now
the
government
by
their
view
says
“you’ll
take
everything
into
consideration
but
this
one
element
that’s
valued
at
the
$144,625
you’ve
got
to
exclude
that.”
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
coming
to
the
highest
and
best
used
concept,
what
is
the
highest
and
best
used
of
this
particular
elevator
at
the
end
of
the
term
to
use
it
right
where
it
is,
isn’t
it?
and
there’s
a
reasonable
probability
of
using
that
there
and
the
second
circuit
says,
we
don’t
care
what
the
probabilities
are.
it
isn’t
just
compensation
to
pay
this
people
off.
a
junk
or
salvage
value
on
this
property
because
there
is
other
things
that
enter
into
this.
just
common
decency
on
the
part
of
the
landlords,
they
follow
this,
got
the
lease,
he
has
got
the
inside
track
and
if
it
adds
value
upon
the
market,
it
should
be
paid
for
and
that’s
our
point.
this
is
an
element
of
value.
we
have
never
contended
that
as
a
property
right
we’re
entitled
to
a
single
dime
for
this
leasehold
expectancy.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i
suppose
it
would
be
pertinent.
however,
we
could
point
out
that
the
railroad
is
perfectly
willing
to
take
on
some
other
client
that
we
might
sell
to
and
giving
the
lease
renewal.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
gentlemen
of
the
court,
if
you
feel
in
this
case
that
this
matter
of
whether
the
government
own
the
fee
in
this
or
did
not
own
it
is
the
crux
of
this
case,
then
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
try
that
matter
of
fact
in
the
trial
court.
that
was
never
tried.
it
was
never
argued
in
the
trial
court
and
in
this
case,
they
repeat
that
that
was
the
case,
we
will
certainly
contest
that
matter
because
we
have
plenty,
i’m
sure
of
evidence
that
this
fee
was
in
the
railroad
yet
and
there
was
no
agreement.
what
i
know
about
it
is
outside
the
record
but
if
that
is
in
your
minds,
this
should
be
remanded
to
find
out
what
the
fact
is.
it
should
now
be
decided
on
that
fact.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
the
thing
is
that
at
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
probability
of
renewal.
i
would
have
to
recognize
your
honor
that
if
the
government
had
owned
this
all
the
time.
when
we
have
a
lease
from
the
government
that
they
want
to
cut
us
off
at
the
end
of
term,
there
wouldn’t
be
anything
we
could
do
about.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
then
if
there
is
it
would
be
probability
of
a
renewal,
would
there?
in
our
case,
we
are
simply
asking.
let
the
market
judge
the
probability
of
renewal.
don’t
tell
the
market
that
there
is
going
to
be
no
renewal,
we
are
entitled
to
that.
no
more
than
less.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
yes.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
the
record
is
silent
on
that
but
for
what
benefit
it
may
be
to
you.
i’m
quite
sure
the
reason
for
the
taking
was
that
the
flooding
line
would
be
so
close
to
the
foundations
of
these
elevators
that
they
wouldn’t
hold
up
anymore
and
consequently
they
felt
they
have
to
take
this
property.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
condemnation
action
to
acquire
the
leasehold
interest
of
the
almota
farmers
elevator
and
warehouse
company
in
a
track
of
land
required
for
the
little
goose
lock
and
dam
project,
a
corps
of
engineers
project
on
the
snake
river
in
eastern
washington.
the
fee
owner,
the
railroad
in
this
case
was
not
joined.
for
many
years,
the
owrnn
company
had
owned
and
operated
a
railroad
on
the
north
bank
of
the
snake
river
which
ran
through
the
little
village
of
almota.
the
almota
elevator
company
in
1919
went
to
the
railroad
and
they
leased
7,500
of
an
acre,
three
quarters
of
an
acre
of
bare
unimproved
land,
absolutely
nothing
on
it.
and
under
various
consecutive
leases
from
that
date
forward,
the
date
of
taking
on
may
26,
1967,
the
almota
company
continued
to
hold
this
lease.
at
the
time
of
the
taking,
they
held
under
a
20-year
lease
which
had
a
term
to
expire
on
october
12,
1974.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
the
date
of
taking
was
may
26,
1967.
it
was
to
expire
october
12,
1974.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
it
had
been
a
20-year
lease.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
oh!
yes,
there
had
been
various
short-term
leases
since
1919.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
consecutive,
continuous.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
no,
it
started
out
with
5-year
leases.
in
fact
the
20-year
lease
is
the
longest
lease
the
company
ever
had.
there
was
no
renewal
option
in
this
lease.
now
that’s
actually
what’s
involved
in
the
taking
in
this
case
and
if
it
was
only,
this
bare
unimproved
land
that
was
involved
here,
we
wouldn’t
have
any
problem
because
the
almota
company
isn’t
arguing
on
the
point
that
the
valuation
of
this
very
leasehold
is
its
use
value
for
the
length
of
the
term
remaining
on
the
lease
less
the
agreed
rent.
we
have
no
argument
over
that.
but
shortly
after
the
company
acquired
this
property,
in
1919
they
went
out
on
the
property
and
they
built
a
warehouse
on
this
property
to
handle
grain
and
some
years
afterwards,
they
built
three
crib
elevators
on
this
property
and
at
some
time
later,
it
put
up
a
concrete
tank
on
the
property.
now,
it’s
all
of
those
improvements
that
are
involved,
it
was
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
all
through
the
period
that
these
improvements
were
on
there.
these
improvements
under
the
terms
of
the
lease
and
the
treatment
of
the
parties
were
the
personal
property
of
the
elevator
company.
the
elevator
company
owned
these
improvements
and
it
had
the
right
to
take
the
improvements
at
the
end
of
the
term.
but
since
those
improvements
were
physically
a
part
of
this
land,
they
were
part
of
what
the
government
had
to
take
in
this
condemnation
action.
now
the
real
problem
as
we
see
it
here
in
this
matter
is
the
valuation
of
these
improvements.
not
the
valuation
of
this
very
leasehold.
there’s
a
basic
difference
here
in
the
duration
of
almota’s
property
interest
in
this
basic
leasehold
and
in
the
improvements
that’s
essential
to
understanding
of
this
case.
in
the
leasehold,
it’s
obvious
at
the
end
of
the
term,
the
reason
anything
there
left,
is
no
property
rights
to
value
but
the
improvements
at
the
end
of
the
term.
almota
still
own
those
improvements.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i’ll
get
to
that
point
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
--
in
just
a
moment.
what
i’m
pointing
out
now
is
that
there’s
a
difference
between
the
very
leasehold
and
the
improvements.
the
ninth
circuit
court
didn’t
appreciate
that.
in
the
one
case,
at
the
end
of
the
term
all
the
rights
were
extinguished.
in
the
other
case,
you’re
still
the
full
fee
owner
of
these
building
improvements
for
their
full
lifetime
as
long
as
they
exist.
what
you
do
with
them,
that’s
part
of
the
valuation
problem.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
for
the
purpose
of
what
the
government
has
to
take,
the
seagren
case
cited
in
our
opening
brief
says,
they
are
part
of
the
real
estate
but
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington
and
we
cited
authority
for
that.
they
are
the
personal
property
of
the
tenant
and
you
have
a
very
confusing
situation
here.
the
government
is
taking
real
estate,
you
got
to
deal
with
this
real
estate
and
yet
what
the
tenant
actually
owns,
his
personal
property
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
value
it
and
his
ownership
continues
when
the
lease
is
up.
the
government
has
treated
this
as
so
we
have
no
further
rights
in
the
property
at
that
time.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that
is
the
argument
of
the
government.
i
would
like
to
get
an
answer
to
that
later
and
if
i
don’t
i’d
appreciate
going
back
to
that
again.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
judge
powell
in
the
district
court
in
spokane.
in
other
words,
the
valuation
of
these
improvements
at
the
end
of
the
term
of
the
lease
or
at
the
time
of
the
taking
is
vastly
different
than
the
manner
of
the
valuation
of
the
bare
leasehold
itself
where
the
rights
are
limited
by
the
duration
of
the
term.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
he
had
no
legal
right
to
continue
to
use
them
in
place.
on
the
other
hand,
i’d
like
to
make
equally
clear
that
the
government
own
no
legal
right
to
determine
that
the
company
could
not
use
them
in
place.
this
is
not
like
the
fuller
case
where
it’s
a
revocable
permit.
the
government
did
not
own
the
fee
at
the
time
of
the
taking.
the
oregon
washington
railroad
navigation
company
owned
this
fee.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that
is
right.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
yes,
the
vested
full
right
in
the
leasehold
and
the
improvements
but
mind,
the
government
did
not
condemn
the
rights
of
the
fee
owner.
this
was
still
property
of
the
fee
owner
and
only
the
fee
owner
could
terminate
this
lease
and
refuse
to
renew.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
the
government
had
no
right
to
insist
because
the
government
was
not
acquiring
the
fee.
this
isn’t
like
the
fuller
case
in
that
respect
where
the
government
could
have
said
we
have
a
legal
right
and
at
the
end
of
the
term
you’re
just
not
going
to
stay
there.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
no,
the
fee
owner
was
not
joined
in
this
case.
and
so
far
as
i
know
that
this
date,
the
government
still
does
not
own
the
fee
to
this
property.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
of
course
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record.
what
i
can
inform
you
that
is
the
policy
of
the
government
and
these
relocation
cases
where
they
relocate
the
railroad
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
railroad
and
they
do
not
acquire
the
fee
they
trade.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
the
time
this
was
done,
no
such
agreement
existed
with
the
railroad.
this
has
to
be
considered
as
the
facts
were
at
the
time.
that
they
did
not
own
the
fee,
the
railroad
did
own
the
fee
and
that’s
very
important
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
for
the
little
goose
lock
and
dam
project,
it
would
be
flooded.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
they
expected
to
acquire
the
fee
by
making
a
deal
with
the
railroad
but
they
hadn’t
made
the
deal
yet.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
right.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
right,
they
relocated
the
railroad
higher
up
on
the
hill
and
went
ahead.
now,
there
wasn’t
any
substantial
factual
dispute
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
you
because
the
government
then
would
have
had
the
right
at
the
end
of
term
to
say,
“sorry
boys,
we’re
not
going
to
renew
but
the
thing
is
we
have
to
take
the
facts
in
this
case
as
they
are.”
the
government
didn’t
do
that.
and
in
the
stipulation
that’s
entered
here
and
we
did
enter
into
a
stipulation
for
the
reason
that
the
only
difference
between
this
ultimately
was
how
do
you
value
these
improvements.
so
we
simply
got
together
and
we
stipulated
on
the
facts.
and
if
it
was
to
be
valued
as
determined
by
the
government,
the
value
is
set
to
be
a
$130,000.
if
it
was
to
be
valued,
the
way
we
contended,
it
was
to
be
$274,625.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
actually,
it
ultimately
boils
down
to
that.
but
i’d
like
to
get
at
it
in
a
little
bit
different
way
there.
in
both
cases,
on
both
valuation,
stipulated
values,
it
was
the
same
property
involved.
i
want
you
to
understand
that
because
there
are
some
contentions
in
here
in
the
argument
of
the
government
in
the
brief
that
would
lead
you
to
the
contrary
but
the
stipulation
was
the
value
of
the
land
and
the
improvements.
that
is
the
leasehold
and
improvements,
in
the
one
case
it
was
a
130
and
the
value
of
the
same
thing
and
the
other
was
264,000,
$274,625.00.
now
we
get
really
to
the
tracks
of
the
thing
and
that
is
the
reason
for
this
difference
in
value
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
elements
of
value
were
entitled
to
be
considered
in
determining
the
value
of
these
improvements.
it
wasn’t
any
argument
over
this
very
leasehold.
now,
the
question
is
what
should
be
considered
when
it
comes
to
determining
the
value
of
these
improvements?
now
in
the
opening
brief,
we
cited
quite
a
number
of
cases
on
the
proposition
that
in
determining
the
fair
market
value
of
any
property
that
you
must
consider,
all
elements
of
value
you
must
consider
all
reasonable,
probable
uses
of
the
property
that
affect
the
very
market
value.
now,
they
don’t
disagree
with
that
but
they
don’t
apply
the
law
--
the
rule.
now
i
cited
the
olson
in
which
this
court
here
lays
down
in
very
good
language
exactly
what
i’ve
said
and
i
had
intended
to
read
it
but
in
the
interest
of
saving
time,
i
will
proceed.
now,
at
this
point
in
determining
what
these
buildings
can
be
used
for,
in
determining
what
the
elements
of
value
that
should
be
considered,
i
think
you
need
to
pretty
well
understand
the
structural
nature
of
these
facilities.
now,
i
mentioned
that
there
were
three
crib
buildings
that
were
put
up
on
the
property.
if
you
understand
what
a
crib
elevator
building
is,
it’s
a
wooden
structure,
it’s
made
of
cribbing,
we
take,
well
for
example
2
x
12
planks
and
a
spike
one
on
top
of
the
other.
and
you
continue
that
type
of
structure
clear
to
the
top
of
the
beams.
now,
each
one
of
these
structures
would
hold
125,000
bushels.
that’s
enough
to
fill
62-1/2,
120,000
capacity
grain
carts
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
size
of
this
thing.
now,
there
were
three
buildings
like
that.
to
top
that
of,
there
was
the
concrete
tank
which
would
hold148,000
bushels,
that
would
take
74
railroad
cars
at
the
same
size
to
fill
that.
now
you
can
realize
and
appreciate
that
there
had
to
be
very
substantial
and
permanent
foundations
under
these
structures.
so
when
you
get
to
the
matter
here
of
selling
this
property
and
determining
fair
market
value,
what’s
the
first
and
most
important
thing
the
buyer
is
going
to
ask?
he
is
going
to
ask
what
are
the
probabilities,
what
are
the
chances
of
continuing
to
use
these
structures
right
were
they
are.
why?
because
he
knows,
there
is
little
or
no
value
whatsoever
to
attempt
to
move
them,
probably
nothing
but
junk
value
to
try
and
move
these
buildings.
that’s
where
the
difference
arises
between
the
government
and
ourselves
in
this
case
and
that
is
in
almota’s
view
at
that
stage
of
the
case,
almota
has
contended
that
there
should
be
taken
into
consideration
that
the
probable
use
of
these
improvements
right
where
they
were
was
very
great
that
was
a
reasonably
probable
use
and
you’ll
find
in
the
stipulation
that
there
were
facts.
in
other
words,
it
was
stipulated
that
was
--
there
was
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
railroad
is
a
general
policy,
never
refuse
to
renew
one
of
these
leases
where
railroad
traffic
was
being
produced
for
the
railroad.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
risks
that
any
buyer
takes.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
you
buy
a
few
property
for
example
and
you
take
the
risks
that
the
party
between
you
and
the
view
might
build
a
high
rise
apartment.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
it
is
a
risk,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
yes
but
the
thing
is
your
honor
that
government
here
would
have
this
value
the
thought
was
a
certainty.
it
is
not
going
to
be
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
term.
we
say
that
it
was
reasonably
probable
that
it
would
be
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
term
and
that
that
is
an
element
of
value
that’s
considered
by
the
market
and
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
this
case
and
with
the
statute
stipulation.
that
was
actually
the
case
because
that’s
the
only
difference
between
the
two
values.
the
government
recognizes
that
the
market
was
valuing
this
probability
for
renewal
and
approximately
a
$144,625
because
that’s
the
only
difference
between
the
two
values.
they
recognized
that
if
you
let
a
buyer
use
his
own
devices
in
determining
for
himself
what
the
probabilities
of
renewal
were
that
he’d
finally
and
hard
knows
bargaining
from
up
until
your
okay.
it’s
worth
$274,625.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
your
talking
of
a
problem
there
your
honor
that
doesn’t
apply
in
this
case,
there
was
no
condemnation
clause
in
the
lease
and
almota
in
this
case
by
--
is
entitled
to
the
full
value
of
these
structures,
whatever
it
may
be.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
now,
there’s
been
some
remarks
made
in
the
briefs
that
would
lead
you
to
the
contrary.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i
realize
that
that
is
in
the
opinion
and
there’s
been
some
contention
of
that
type
in
some
of
the
briefs.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
it’s
absolutely
no
truth
to
it.
that’s
an
erroneous
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
and
the
only
answer
--
i
mean
of
the
ninth
circuit
court.
the
only
answer
i
can
come
up
with
was
that
there
was
a
footnote
to
that
effect
in
one
of
the
government
briefs.
no
citation
has
ever
been
made,
anything
in
the
record
that
that
is
true
and
it
actually
is
not
factual.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that
did
not
happen
as
i
just
mentioned
to
you,
they
don’t
yet
own
the
fee.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
it
is.
it
is
but
it
was
tried
in
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
that
the
railroad
owned
this
property
and
the
government
did
not.
the
government
is
absolutely
not
in
the
position
in
this
case
to
held
out
till
1974
and
then
said,
“gentlemen,
we’re
not
renewing,
take
your
elevator
and
go.”
and
yet
that’s
what
they
would
do.
they
would
value
this
as
though
that
was
the
certain
result
at
the
end
of
the
term.
we
say
that
it’s
for
the
market
to
determine
what
the
probabilities
are
of
that
happening.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well
now
except
for
this
your
honor.
and
that
is,
i
don’t
think
it’s
exactly
the
law
and
it’s
not
in
here
and
hasn’t
argued.
you
know
when
we
ask
for
compensation,
we
can’t
ask
for
the
benefits
of
the
project
and
value.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
and
the
trial
judge
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
government
can’t
assert
the
detriments
of
it
either.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
in
other
words
that
they
have
got
to
take
the
title
as
it
was
at
the
time
they
are
taking
this
and
at
that
time
the
government
didn’t
own
it.
now,
you
see
where
this
renewal
of
the
lease
comes
in.
it
isn’t
really
renewal
of
the
lease.
it
comes
in,
in
determining
what
the
probabilities
are
that
at
the
end
of
this
term,
this
personal
property
continue,
can
continue
to
be
used
right
where
it
is.
if
it
can
continue
to
be
used
there,
it’s
of
great
value.
if
it
can’t
be,
it’s
probably
nothing
but
junk.
i
want
to
point
out
here
that
the
argument
the
government
has
made
here
actually
they’re
really
only
allowing
this
junk
value
for
this.
if
you
want
to
refer
to
that
charlotte
case
that’s
cited
in
the
brief
and
i
didn’t
cite
the
case
for
that
purpose
but
it
says
that
and
that
is
under
the
facts
there.
the
tenant
did
not
own
the
building
improvements.
yet,
and
that’s
the
washington
dc
circuit
case.
yet
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
owner
was
entitled
to
the
use
value
of
those
improvements
for
the
entire
period
of
the
lease.
now
here,
all
the
government
would
give
us
as
a
use
value
of
these
improvements
for
the
term.
i’m
pointing
out
that
in
the
charlotte
case,
the
court
has
held
we
can
get
that
without
owning
it.
now
all
that
the
government
would
give
us
in
addition
in
this
case
to
what
the
party
in
the
charlotte
case
got,
who
didn’t
own
the
improvements
is
they
give
us
this
junk
value
for
these
improvements.
what
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
a
concrete
tank
when
you
go
to
try
and
move
it
or
tear
it
down?
just
a
bunch
of
rubble,
that’s
all
and
that’s
all
they
allow
us
in
addition
to
what
was
allowed
the
owner
in
the
charlotte
case.
it’s
just
a
junk
value
of
these
improvements.
i
might
also
call
attention
that
we
are
only
arguing
and
have
only
argued
that
it
is
to
be
taken
into
consideration
only
the
probability
of
the
renewal
of
this
lease
at
the
end
of
the
term,
in
other
words,
the
probability
that
we
can
continue
to
use
it
there.
now,
i’ve
cited
the
brief
the
manhattan
case
and
the
upper
alleghany
case
second
circuit
cases.
those
cases
go
one
step
further
than
what
we
are
arguing
here.
they
would
have
it
valued
as
used
property
in
place
for
used
in
place
without
proving
any
probability
of
renewal.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
the
concrete
tank
was
put
up
about
1954
and
the
rest
have
been
put
up
about
1940
and
the
flat
house
about
1919.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
not
necessarily.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
there’s
no
salvage
to
that.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
really
not.
when
you
start
tearing
down
plank
spike
together,
i
leave
it
to
your
judgment
what
you’re
going
to
have
left.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i
think
not
your
honor.
it
simply
the
policy
the
railroad
to
want
to
control
these
properties
to
ensure
that
there’s
freight
going
to
the
railroad.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
your
honor,
that’s
just
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make.
prudent
businessman
and
you
got
to
assume
that
a
prudent
buyer,
you
got
to
assume
that
the
government
in
agreeing
to
this
$274,000
valuation
was
considering
a
prudent
buyer
willing
to
pay
that,
they’ve
admitted
that
buyers
on
the
market,
if
you
left
them
to
their
own
devices
and
let
them
be
examined
all
of
this
would
have
come
up
with
that
figure.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
he’d
want
something
more
than
that
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
he
would
do
it
with
the
railroad
and
the
type
of
lease
as
it
was
being
written
and
has
done
quite
regularly.
it’s
not
uncommon
at
all
and
the
reason
is
that
the
railroads
are
after
freight
traffic
and
don’t
continue
renewing
those
leases
time
after
time
allowed
any
question.
and
that’s
why
the
market
makes
a
difference
of
a
$144,625.
if
this
were
so
speculative
and
so
uncertain,
the
market
would
have
said,
well
we’ll
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
more.
and
that’s
all.
but
this
thing,
there’s
more
than
twice
the
difference
and
value
between
the
government’s
contention
and
our
own
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
right.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
here,
it
never
had
been
more
than
that.
i
suspected
it
may
have
been
a
little
less
at
one
time.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
right,
that’s
right.
the
railroad
saves
these
properties
for
justice
purpose
and
they
continue
to
lease
them,
the
only
thing
they
want
to
control
out
is
that
if
the
lessee
goes
to
doing
business
with
someone
else
and
doesn’t
produce
anymore
freight
traffic,
then
they
better
watch
out.
i
want
to
call
attention
that
the
government
has
gone
against
the
unit
rule
cases
and
they’re
against
in
conflict
with
the
second
circuit
cases,
the
washington
dc
circuit
case
in
our
opinion
is
in
line
with
the
second
circuit
although
it
doesn’t
specifically
so
state
and
they’re
also
in
conflict
with
a
statute
of
congress
that
was
enacted
in
the
first
part
of
1971
which
now
recognizes
that
just
compensation
is
more
than
what
the
government
is
arguing
in
this
case.
and
by
policy
of
the
congress
now
that
in
this
case,
they
would
award
the
full
value
that
those
improvements
add
to
the
whole
value
of
the
property.
i’d
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
you
please.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
mr.
chief
justice,
about
the
petty
case,
we’ve
dealt
with
that
at
length
in
the
briefs
and
the
preferences
made
to
that
i
think
that
the
matter
is
fully
answered.
but
again
i
repeat,
in
the
petty
case,
there
was
only
the
very
leasehold
to
value
in
that
case.
there
were
no
tenant
own
building
improvements.
the
court
didn’t
purport
to
be
talking
about
tenant
own
building
improvements
in
any
sense
whatsoever.
also,
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
that
counsel
and
in
the
briefs
has
argued
a
great
length
about
this
matter
of
property
rights.
the
only
property
rights
we’re
really
talking
about
in
this
case
is
the
very
leasehold
about
which
we
have
no
disagreement
and
the
building
improvements
and
machinery
that
were
disagreeing
about.
there
is
no
property
right
that
we
are
claiming
in
the
leasehold
expectancy.
we
haven’t
asked
for
payment
of
a
property
right
in
the
leasehold
expectancy.
what
we
do
say
is
that
in
the
valuation
of
those
building
improvements
that
we’re
entitled
to
the
consideration
of
all
elements
that
land
value
to
those
improvements
upon
the
market.
we
are
entitled
to
the
consideration
of
all
reasonably
probable
uses
of
that
property.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
that’s
not
limited
by
the
7-1/2
years
because
as
i
have
pointed
out,
at
the
end
of
the
7-1/2
years
we
still
own
these
buildings.
what
are
they
worth
then?
counsel
would
have
them
worth
nothing.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i
said
that
if
you
took
their
view
they
would
be
worth
nothing.
under
our
view
considering
all
elements
of
value
and
the
fact
that
in
all
probability,
they
could
continue
to
be
used
in
place.
they
have
great
value
in
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
because
of
the
probability
of
continuing
to
use
them
right
where
they
are.
what
are
you
going
to
use
those
buildings
for
at
the
end
of
the
term?
counsel
would
say
there
is
only
one
use
you
can
consider
and
that’s
to
tear
them
down
and
move
them.
but
the
market
says,
look,
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
we
can
use
them
right
where
we
are.
this
court
in
the
alton
cases
said,
all
reasonable
probabilities
are
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
the
court
says
in
making
that
estimate,
there
should
taken
into
account
all
considerations
that
might
be
brought
forward
and
reasonably
the
given
substantial
weight
in
such
bargaining.
now
the
government
by
their
view
says
“you’ll
take
everything
into
consideration
but
this
one
element
that’s
valued
at
the
$144,625
you’ve
got
to
exclude
that.”
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
coming
to
the
highest
and
best
used
concept,
what
is
the
highest
and
best
used
of
this
particular
elevator
at
the
end
of
the
term
to
use
it
right
where
it
is,
isn’t
it?
and
there’s
a
reasonable
probability
of
using
that
there
and
the
second
circuit
says,
we
don’t
care
what
the
probabilities
are.
it
isn’t
just
compensation
to
pay
this
people
off.
a
junk
or
salvage
value
on
this
property
because
there
is
other
things
that
enter
into
this.
just
common
decency
on
the
part
of
the
landlords,
they
follow
this,
got
the
lease,
he
has
got
the
inside
track
and
if
it
adds
value
upon
the
market,
it
should
be
paid
for
and
that’s
our
point.
this
is
an
element
of
value.
we
have
never
contended
that
as
a
property
right
we’re
entitled
to
a
single
dime
for
this
leasehold
expectancy.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
i
suppose
it
would
be
pertinent.
however,
we
could
point
out
that
the
railroad
is
perfectly
willing
to
take
on
some
other
client
that
we
might
sell
to
and
giving
the
lease
renewal.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
gentlemen
of
the
court,
if
you
feel
in
this
case
that
this
matter
of
whether
the
government
own
the
fee
in
this
or
did
not
own
it
is
the
crux
of
this
case,
then
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
try
that
matter
of
fact
in
the
trial
court.
that
was
never
tried.
it
was
never
argued
in
the
trial
court
and
in
this
case,
they
repeat
that
that
was
the
case,
we
will
certainly
contest
that
matter
because
we
have
plenty,
i’m
sure
of
evidence
that
this
fee
was
in
the
railroad
yet
and
there
was
no
agreement.
what
i
know
about
it
is
outside
the
record
but
if
that
is
in
your
minds,
this
should
be
remanded
to
find
out
what
the
fact
is.
it
should
now
be
decided
on
that
fact.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
the
thing
is
that
at
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
probability
of
renewal.
i
would
have
to
recognize
your
honor
that
if
the
government
had
owned
this
all
the
time.
when
we
have
a
lease
from
the
government
that
they
want
to
cut
us
off
at
the
end
of
term,
there
wouldn’t
be
anything
we
could
do
about.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
well,
then
if
there
is
it
would
be
probability
of
a
renewal,
would
there?
in
our
case,
we
are
simply
asking.
let
the
market
judge
the
probability
of
renewal.
don’t
tell
the
market
that
there
is
going
to
be
no
renewal,
we
are
entitled
to
that.
no
more
than
less.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
yes.
mr.
lawrence
earl
hickman
the
record
is
silent
on
that
but
for
what
benefit
it
may
be
to
you.
i’m
quite
sure
the
reason
for
the
taking
was
that
the
flooding
line
would
be
so
close
to
the
foundations
of
these
elevators
that
they
wouldn’t
hold
up
anymore
and
consequently
they
felt
they
have
to
take
this
property.
