chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-1005,
michigan
against
payne.
mr.
smietanka,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
before
you
passed
that,
when
he
gave
the
testimony
against
him
as
co-defendant,
did
he
acknowledge
at
all
the
facts
that
you
presented
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
testimony
used
against
him
in
any
way
thereafter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
in
this
trial,
was
his
testimony
against
bradford
available
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
some
rule
or
law
of
michigan
prohibit
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
confession.
i’m
speaking
of
his
affirmative
testimony,
on
the
record
in
open
court
in
bradford’s
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
was
by
virtue
of
an
agreement,
not
by
a--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
neither
the
jury
nor
the
judge,
this
trial
you’re
speaking
of
now,
were
aware
of
his
testimony
which
amounted
to
a
judicial
confession
in
the
bradford
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
and
so
that
was,
they
allowed
him
to
withdraw
his
guilty
plea.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
thrust
of
that
holding,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
lunch,
you
will
have
only
10
minutes
left
and
i
hope
you
are
saving
a
substantial
amount
of
that
time
to
emphasize
the
differences
in
a
situation
when
the
second
sentence
was
imposed
as
compared
with
the
first.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue.
you
have
about
10
minutes
all
together.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
mean
to
limit
you
to
that,
but
that’s
a
matter
of
very
great
interest
to
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now,
the
important
thing
perhaps
or
one
of
the
important
things
is
the
impact
of
this
as
compared
with
the
posture
of
the
case
when
it
was
before
the
original
sentencing
judge.
at
that
time,
it
was
different
judge
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
judge
had
the
impression
somewhere,
i
get
it,
out
of
the
record--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
since
he
fully
confessed
and
re--
expressed
regret
and
sorrow
for
the
shooting
of
these
officers,
that
he
was
reasonable
candidate
for
rehabilitation
and,
did
not
the
second
judge
give
some
indication
that
he
thought
that
this
was
a--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
much
in
marked
contrast?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
the
essence
of
it
that
the
verdict
in
the
second
trial
cannot
be
read
any
other
way
than
a
finding
that
he
testified
falsely
under
oath
and
that
they
reach
that
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
but,
is
that
as
important,
really,
as
the
fact
that
the
judge
said,
in
sentencing
after
the
trial,
that
his
man
was
a
different
person
in
terms
of
his
probability
of
his
rehabilitation
and
that
that
was
the
basis
for
his
giving
the
heavier
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
he
not,
not
once
but
twice,
make
a
full
confession?
when
he
testified
in,
was
it
bradford’s
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
he
testified
in
bradford’s
trial
leading
to
the
conviction
of
his
co-defendant,
he
fully
described
in
every
detail
his
participation
in
the
card.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
none
of
this
information
was,
of
course--
could’ve
been
known
to
the
judge
who
sentenced
him
on
the
guilty
plea
in
the
first
instance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
neuhard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
mean
there’s
some
spillover
effect
when
he
testified
against
bradford?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
a
time
was
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
a
time
was
that
between
the
two
trials?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
so
that
there’s
some
spillover
effect
of
the
original
confession
when
the
man’s
in
open
court
in
the
presence
of
a
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
it
a
confession
or
was
he
testifying--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
testified
in
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
a
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
after
the
original
plea
of
guilty
and
sentencing
did
he
move
for
a
new
trial
and,
well,
move
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
michigan
have
any
statute
allowing
some
particular
time
limitation
on
withdrawing
a
guilty
plea
after
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
event,
he
could’ve--
in
view
of
his
subsequent
conduct,
that
wouldn’t
have
been
a
barrier
to
him
because
he
did--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
didn’t
this
court
settle
that
issue
in
williams
against
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can
understand
your
emphasizing
the
fact--
the
circumstances
of
this
first
confession
right
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
after
payne
was
taken
into
custody,
but
we
can’t
avoid
looking,
can
we,
at
the
record
which
shows
that
police
officer
identified
payne
by
sight
and
that
bullet
holes
were
found
at
the
back
of
his
car
and
that
the
pistol--
payne’s
pistol
was
found
to
be
the
pistol
that
had
been
used
to
shoot
the
officers?
are
those
factors
not
part
of
the
whole
mosaic
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
judge
in
the
trial,
the
judge
whose
sentence
is
under
consideration
now,
was
not
entitled
to
conclude
that
this
man
was
a
less
probable
prospect
for
a
successful
rehabilitation
than
the
first
sentencing
judge
had
concluded
when
he
had
expressed
great
sorrow
over
his
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
that
got
to
do
with
the
question
i
just
put
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
don’t
you
think
his
conduct,
in
the
meantime,
should--
is
something
that
judge
may
take
into
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
talking
about
his
conduct
in
prison.
i’m
talking
about
his
conduct
outside
the
prison.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
inevitably,
just
as
a
matter
of
time,
of
sequence,
he
was
bound
to
know
more
because
he
knew
about
the
intervening
bradford
trial
which
the
first
judge
couldn’t
have
known
about
because
it
hadn’t
happened.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn’t
know
about
it
when
he
sentenced
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
in
the
first
trial
when
he
sentenced
this
man.
had
the
sentence
not
been
announced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
bradford
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
the
death
sentence,
a
choice
between
life
and
death
was
made
in
williams,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can
understand
his
discomfiture
over
that.
we
can
all
understand
that.
but,
as
a
practical
matter,
your
experience
as
a
public
defender,
it
would--
isn’t
it
a
fair
statement
that
at
the
end
of
a
trial
or
at
the
end
of
a
guilty
plea,
the
guilty
plea
sessions,
a
judge
frequently
may
have
a
certain
impression
about
what
he’s
going
to
do.
he
may
indicate
to
counsel
that
he
is--
will
very
likely
grant
probation,
but
sentence
is
deferred
until
he
gets
the
presentence
report
and
then
he
gets
the
presentence
report,
and
then
he
will
not
consider
probation
because,
at
the
time
of
a
guilty
plea
and
the
right
of
elocution
occurs,
the
defendant
or
the
man
is
putting
his
best
foot
forward,
but
when
the
presentence
report
comes
in,
as
in
williams,
a
whole
new
panorama
is
opened
to
the
judge.
isn’t
that--
as
a
practical
matter,
doesn’t
that
happen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
situation
can
change
by
a
virtue
of
different
impressions
about
the
prospects
of
rehabilitation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you’re
supposing
it
takes
a
due
process
hearing
to
evaluate
that
second
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
williams--
going
back
to
williams.
in
williams,
the
district--
the
sentencing
judge
actually,
as
i
recall
it,
went
around
the
neighborhood
and
talked
to
people
and
got
information
about
him,
and
then
had
a
presentence
report,
perhaps
in
addition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
ex
parte
information
in
which
the
defendant
couldn’t
have
any
possibility
of
challenging
any
of
the
information.
he
said
“this
man
is
going
to
be
sentenced
to
death".
wasn’t
that
the
hole
issue,
that
there
was
no
due
process
question
involved
in
williams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
not
attacking
the
basic
conviction,
just
the
increase
in
the
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
means
that
in
this
court,
here
and
now,
today,
it
must
be
accepted
that
the
verdict
was
correct
and
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
correct,
namely
that
he
did
shoot
these
police
officers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
this
time?
well,
are
you
suggesting
a
challenge
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
there
wasn’t
much
percentage
in
the
prosecution
prosecuting
him
for
perjury
with--
in
light
of
the
heavy
sentence
he
already
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
not
have
a
trial
before
a
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
testifies,
does
he
not
tender
the
truth
or
falsity
of
his
own
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
page
was
that
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it’s
3--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
show
how
long
a
hearing
was
held
at
the
time
of
the
original
guilty
plea
and
sentence,
but
i
suppose
also
that
that’s
a
relatively
brief
procedure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
judge
says
in
his
affidavit
that,
without
going
into
what
is
already
part
of
the
record,
and
now
i’m
ensurging
because
there’s
an
antecedent
i,
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
brutal
details
of
the
crime
which,
over
three
days
plus--
which,
over
a
period
of
three
days,
plus
its--
the
judge’s
owns
impressions
of
the
defendant
during
these
days,
plus
the
impression
of
his
testimony
during
those
trials.
so,
the
judge
has
a
great
deal
more,
in
that
sense,
a
better
opportunity
to
observe
and
make--
draw
inferences
from
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
than
the
sentencing
judge
on
a
guilty
plea,
wouldn’t
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you’re
saying
that
when
he
said
that,
this
is
not
true.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
neuhard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
enlarge
your
time
in

of

enlargement
here.
you

about
four
minutes.
you
were
down

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
neuhard,
you
were
not
appointed
by
the
court
in
the
usual
procedure
but
you
came
here
at
our
request,
indirectly
at

and
on

of
the
court,
i
want
to
thank
you

your

not

to
your
client,
but
your
assistance
to

thank
you,

the

is
submitted.
chief

warren
e.

we’ll

judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
it
a
confession
or
was
he
testifying--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
testified
in
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
a
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
after
the
original
plea
of
guilty
and
sentencing
did
he
move
for
a
new
trial
and,
well,
move
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
michigan
have
any
statute
allowing
some
particular
time
limitation
on
withdrawing
a
guilty
plea
after
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
event,
he
could’ve--
in
view
of
his
subsequent
conduct,
that
wouldn’t
have
been
a
barrier
to
him
because
he
did--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
didn’t
this
court
settle
that
issue
in
williams
against
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can
understand
your
emphasizing
the
fact--
the
circumstances
of
this
first
confession
right
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
after
payne
was
taken
into
custody,
but
we
can’t
avoid
looking,
can
we,
at
the
record
which
shows
that
police
officer
identified
payne
by
sight
and
that
bullet
holes
were
found
at
the
back
of
his
car
and
that
the
pistol--
payne’s
pistol
was
found
to
be
the
pistol
that
had
been
used
to
shoot
the
officers?
are
those
factors
not
part
of
the
whole
mosaic
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
judge
in
the
trial,
the
judge
whose
sentence
is
under
consideration
now,
was
not
entitled
to
conclude
that
this
man
was
a
less
probable
prospect
for
a
successful
rehabilitation
than
the
first
sentencing
judge
had
concluded
when
he
had
expressed
great
sorrow
over
his
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
that
got
to
do
with
the
question
i
just
put
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
don’t
you
think
his
conduct,
in
the
meantime,
should--
is
something
that
judge
may
take
into
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
talking
about
his
conduct
in
prison.
i’m
talking
about
his
conduct
outside
the
prison.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
inevitably,
just
as
a
matter
of
time,
of
sequence,
he
was
bound
to
know
more
because
he
knew
about
the
intervening
bradford
trial
which
the
first
judge
couldn’t
have
known
about
because
it
hadn’t
happened.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn’t
know
about
it
when
he
sentenced
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
in
the
first
trial
when
he
sentenced
this
man.
had
the
sentence
not
been
announced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
bradford
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
the
death
sentence,
a
choice
between
life
and
death
was
made
in
williams,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can
understand
his
discomfiture
over
that.
we
can
all
understand
that.
but,
as
a
practical
matter,
your
experience
as
a
public
defender,
it
would--
isn’t
it
a
fair
statement
that
at
the
end
of
a
trial
or
at
the
end
of
a
guilty
plea,
the
guilty
plea
sessions,
a
judge
frequently
may
have
a
certain
impression
about
what
he’s
going
to
do.
he
may
indicate
to
counsel
that
he
is--
will
very
likely
grant
probation,
but
sentence
is
deferred
until
he
gets
the
presentence
report
and
then
he
gets
the
presentence
report,
and
then
he
will
not
consider
probation
because,
at
the
time
of
a
guilty
plea
and
the
right
of
elocution
occurs,
the
defendant
or
the
man
is
putting
his
best
foot
forward,
but
when
the
presentence
report
comes
in,
as
in
williams,
a
whole
new
panorama
is
opened
to
the
judge.
isn’t
that--
as
a
practical
matter,
doesn’t
that
happen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
situation
can
change
by
a
virtue
of
different
impressions
about
the
prospects
of
rehabilitation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you’re
supposing
it
takes
a
due
process
hearing
to
evaluate
that
second
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
williams--
going
back
to
williams.
in
williams,
the
district--
the
sentencing
judge
actually,
as
i
recall
it,
went
around
the
neighborhood
and
talked
to
people
and
got
information
about
him,
and
then
had
a
presentence
report,
perhaps
in
addition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
ex
parte
information
in
which
the
defendant
couldn’t
have
any
possibility
of
challenging
any
of
the
information.
he
said
“this
man
is
going
to
be
sentenced
to
death".
wasn’t
that
the
hole
issue,
that
there
was
no
due
process
question
involved
in
williams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
not
attacking
the
basic
conviction,
just
the
increase
in
the
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
means
that
in
this
court,
here
and
now,
today,
it
must
be
accepted
that
the
verdict
was
correct
and
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
correct,
namely
that
he
did
shoot
these
police
officers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
this
time?
well,
are
you
suggesting
a
challenge
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
there
wasn’t
much
percentage
in
the
prosecution
prosecuting
him
for
perjury
with--
in
light
of
the
heavy
sentence
he
already
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
not
have
a
trial
before
a
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
testifies,
does
he
not
tender
the
truth
or
falsity
of
his
own
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
page
was
that
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it’s
3--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
show
how
long
a
hearing
was
held
at
the
time
of
the
original
guilty
plea
and
sentence,
but
i
suppose
also
that
that’s
a
relatively
brief
procedure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
judge
says
in
his
affidavit
that,
without
going
into
what
is
already
part
of
the
record,
and
now
i’m
ensurging
because
there’s
an
antecedent
i,
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
brutal
details
of
the
crime
which,
over
three
days
plus--
which,
over
a
period
of
three
days,
plus
its--
the
judge’s
owns
impressions
of
the
defendant
during
these
days,
plus
the
impression
of
his
testimony
during
those
trials.
so,
the
judge
has
a
great
deal
more,
in
that
sense,
a
better
opportunity
to
observe
and
make--
draw
inferences
from
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
than
the
sentencing
judge
on
a
guilty
plea,
wouldn’t
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you’re
saying
that
when
he
said
that,
this
is
not
true.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
neuhard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
enlarge
your
time
in
due
of
the
enlargement
here.
you
can
have
about
four
minutes.
you
were
down
to
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
neuhard,
you
were
not
appointed
by
the
court
in
the
usual
procedure
but
you
came
here
at
our
request,
indirectly
at
least,
and
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
assistance
not
only
to
your
client,
but
your
assistance
to
the
court.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
