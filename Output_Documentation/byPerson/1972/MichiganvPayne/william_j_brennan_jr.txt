j.
brennan,

what
was
the
holding
would
set
aside
bradford’s
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
based
on
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whose
confession
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
introduced
at
the--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
said
that
that
was
the
fruit
of
these
beatings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
the
holding
of
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
now
on
appeal
in
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
the
judge
hold
when
he
set
aside
the
guilty
plea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
he
did
or
did
not
say
he
conformed
with
the
act
or
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
he
said
he
conformed
with
the
act
in
what
sentence
he
might
give.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
completely
different
from
the
second
case
where
he
plead
defecto.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
setting
aside
the
plea
the
product
of
a
coerced
confession.
it
has
very
little
relevance,
if
any,
to
the
accuracy
of
the
plaintive.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
can
see.
i
didn’t--
what
i
said,
i
said
it
had
very
little
relevance
to
the
plea
in
a
sense
that
it
would’ve
been
set
aside
when
it
was
actually
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
being
tried
at
the
second
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
neuhard,
is
it
clear
in
this
case
that
the
second
judge,
when
he--
when
the
second
sentence
was
imposed,
took
into
account
in
assessing
the
defendant’s
character
and
his
conduct
since
the
first
trial,
compared
his
conduct
with
his
conduct
at
his
guilty
plea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
so
he
is
saying
that
while
he
had
read
the
transcript
at
the
first
sent--
at
the
first
guilty
plea,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
he
say
that
while
he
had
confessed
his
guilt
at
the
first
guilty
plea,
he
denies
it
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
isn’t
this
using
a
guilty
plea
that
has
been
set
aside
as
invalid
as
the
product
of
coerced
confession,
isn’t
it
using
that
guilty
plea
in
some
way
a
subsequent
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
make
that
point
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
but,
that
would
be
the
same
even
if
he
didn’t--
even
if
he
never
knew
have
pleaded
guilty
the
first
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
of
giles
and
maryland?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
a
case
where
this
court
called
a
presentence
report,
turned
to
resolve
on
what
we
founded
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
he
said
at
the
second
sentencing,
in
effect,
retracted
in
the
affidavit
that
he’s
filed
in
this
court
because
he
now
acknowledges
what
he
said
was
not
the
case
at
the
second
sentencing,
namely
that
judge
hadsol
did
have
the
opportunity
to
know
all
about
the
case
because
he
presided
at
the
de
facto
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
don’t--
and
that
first
comes
to
the
record
when
we
get
the
affidavit
here
in
this
court.
