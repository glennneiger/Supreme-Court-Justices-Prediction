justice
potter
stewart
and
that
issue
is
not
here,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
judge
burns
who,
in
fact,
had
set
aside
the
original
judgment
and
granted
a
new
trial,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
that,
just
on--
he
wasn’t
an
appellate
judge.
he
was--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
neuhard,
referring
to
judge
burns’
affidavit
executed
last
november
29th
and
appearing
on
page
21
(a)
of
the
affidavit--
of
the
appendix,
the
paragraph
4
there
seems
to
be
an
open
invitation
for
this
court
to
order
the
production
of
the
supplemental
presentence
report.
at
least
that’s
how
i
read
it.
it’s
an
affidavit
filed
in
this
court
and
he
says
he
can’t
make
it
public
but
which
a
higher
court
than
this
one
can
order
it
produced.
i
read
that
as
an
open
invitation.
would
you
have
any
objection
if
we
accepted
that
invitation?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
appendix,
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
of
your--
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
says
that
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
he
implies
at
least,
i
thought,
that
there
was
something
here,
an
addition
here--
justice
potter
stewart
well--
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
who
sought
could--
justice
potter
stewart
could
determine
or
could
resolve
the
ambiguity.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
would
be
within
the
confine
of
the
affidavit
on
november
29th,
paragraph
4,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
it
does.
that’s
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
if
you
would
have
any
objection.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
new
one
is
filed,
as
you
know,
in
this
court
and
he
does
make
this
reference
in
paragraph
4
and
does
point
out
that
a
higher
court,
presumably
this
one,
can
order
it
to
be
produced.
