mr.
james
r.
neuhard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
step
into
the
conduct
area
of
the
argument
at
this
time.
however,
i
feel
there
are
a
few
responsive
notes
i’d
like
to
make
on
the
issue
of
retroactivities.
i
agree
with
the
prosecutor
when
he
states
this
is
a
very
complex
problem.
this
case
had
been
in
the
courts
now
for
over
10
years
on
various
aspects.
in
fact,
there’s
a
collateral
matter
pending
on
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
the
companion
case
to
this
case.
the
co-defendant
lionel
bradford’s
case
is
on
appeal
in
the
sixth
circuit,
again,
by
the
people
because
lionel
bradford’s
conviction
was
vacated
by
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
michigan.
the
basis
for
the
vacation
was
on
the--
that
leroy
payne’s
testimony
was
used
to
convict
lionel
bradford
and
judge
cornelius
kennedy,
in
vacating
the
conviction,
held
that
because
his
confession
was
brutally
beaten
out
of
him,
it
was
as
though
the
state
had
knowingly
used
purged
testimony
to
obtain
the
conviction
of
bradford.
this
also
would
get
into
the
conduct
argument,
but--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
reason
was
that--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
almost
a
period
now
of
10
years.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
unusual
fact
situation.
the
answer
to
that
basically
is
that
when
leroy
payne
was
picked
up
by
the
police
officers
he
was
in
the
custody
of
three
various
police
departments,
and
there’s
no
dispute
that
the
reason
for
vacating
his
guilty
plea
in
this
particular
case
was
because
the
confession
was
beaten
out
of
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
lionel
bradford’s
trial,
they
wanted
to
introduce
pictures
taken
of
leroy
payne
after
his
confessions
and
they
were
excluded
because
they
were
inflammatory,
that
he
was
in
such
a
brutally
beaten
condition.
his
thumbs
were
sprained,
his
face
was
swollen,
his
genitals
were
squeezed
until
he
was
brought
into
a
state
where
he
confessed.
all
of
the
activities
from
the
moment
he
was
picked
up
until
he
testified
in
lionel
bradford’s
trial
and
was
sentenced
were
while
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
police
department
of
a
space
of
over
five
months,
four-and-a
half
months.
and,
because
of
that
fact,
when
he
finally
did
testify
at
lionel
bradford’s
trial,
and
he
did
go
to
sentencing,
he
initially
intended
to
sue
the
police
departments
for
the
condition
in
which
the
manner
which
they
treated
him
and
he
decided
not
to
do
so,
and--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
because--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
because
the
confession
that
was
introduced
was
the
testimony
of
lionel
bradford.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that
is
leroy
payne’s.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
lionel
bradford’s
trial,
that
is,
he
took
the
stand
and
testified.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
it
was
his
testimony.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
the--
people
are
appealing
that
case
to
the
sixth
circuit.
that--
our
appendix
in
this
particular
case
has
extensive
quotations
from
the
bradford
transcript
that
show
the
manner
of
testimony
of
leroy
payne
plus
all
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers
both
had
payne’s
second
trial
or
his
first
trial,
as
it
was,
after
his
plea
and
at
lionel
bradford’s
trial,
and
it
sat
on
that
length,
for
purposes
of
comparison
to
show
that
judge
hadsol
knew
as
much
as
the
second
sentencing
judge,
judge
burns,
when
he
sentenced
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
second
sentencing,
judge
burns
said
that--
i’m
sorry,
at
the
first
sentencing,
judge
hadsol
said
that
when
he
gave
him
19-40
years
in
prison
that,
“i’m
taking
into
account
your
remorseful
condition
now,
and
if
it
continues,
you
might
get
released
early.”
because
michigan
has
indeterminate
sentencing,
it
takes
into
account
these
vagaries
of
personality
changes
which
can
occur,
and
judge
hadsol
was
well-aware
of
this.
he
was
well-aware
of
what
payne
had
said
at
his
first
trial
and
he
was
grateful
that
payne
had
decided
not
to
sue
the
police
officers,
which
he
has
not
done.
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
get
into
the--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
while
he
was
with
that--
the
reason
for
the
vacation
of
the
guilty
plea
was
because
it
was
beaten
out
of
him.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
the
first
sentencing.
it
also
followed
lionel
bradford’s
trial.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
the
same
as
a
confession
which
was
beaten
out
of
you
as
an
admission.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
the
point
is
the
same.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that--
yes,
your
honor,
that
the
guilty
plea
was
the
product
of
the
coercion
of
the
byron
county
police
officers.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
you
mean,
while
he
was
in
court,
was
he
being
coerced
at
that
particular
time?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
the
implication
is--
that’s
our
implic--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
directly,
your
honor,
i’m
without
knowledge
on
that
point.
whether
mr.
payne
would
contend
that--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that
it
was
the
product
of
the
coerced
confessions
and
that
it
directly
led
to
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
it
is
in
the
sense
that
after
the
first
convictions
and
the
guilty
plea--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
i
think
it
has
some
direct
bearing
on
whether
or
not
a
man
would
plead
guilty
knowing
that
he
had
three
confessions.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that’s
correct.
it
may
in
the
abstract
or
it
may
in
fact
have
been
a
true
plea,
although
mr.
payne,
once
he
was
out
of
the
custody
of
the
byron
county
police
officers,
did
begin
the
appellate
process
and
then,
when
he
came
back
to
trial,
he
testified
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
there
was--
the
initial
four
months
would
be,
i’d
say,
about
three
months
bef--
after
he
plead
guilty
until
the
bradford
trial,
and
then
it
would
be
a
period
of
about
two
years,
i
would
imagine,
before
the
first
plea--
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
sen--
was
made
and
that
was
in
front
of
judge
hadsol.
following
that,
there
was
a
renewed
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
front
of
judge
burns,
at
which,
judge
burns,
the
second
sentencing
judge,
granted
it.
in
between
those
two
motions
for
new
trial,
there
was
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
remand
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
for
determination
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
plea
was
made.
so,
it
would
be--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
she
didn’t
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
was
not
true
in
fact.
she
did
say
it
was
a
product
of
a
coercion
of
the
worst
circumstances
and
should
not
have
been
injected
into
the
trial
by
the
people,
knowing
these
facts
to
be
true.
if
i
may,
there
are
a
few
points
i’d
like
to
make
on
the
issue
of
retroactivity.
the--
i--
we
feel
our
brief
is
adequate
on
this
point,
but
there
are
several
points
that
should
be
brought
out.
this
issue
was
pending
on
appeal.
when
the
pearce
decision
was
released,
it
was
based
on
prior
michigan
authority.
the
case
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
when
it
was
released
two
days
subsequent
to
the
release
of
pearce,
took
into
account
peripherally
the
pearce
decision,
but
the
majority
was
a
2-1
decision
rule
that
because
the
second
sentencing
judge
knew
more
about
the
defendant
than
the
first
judge,
because
he
had
taken
a
plea,
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
prior
michigan
law
says,
very
much
like
pearce,
that
if
the
situation
is
such
that
the
sentence
might
have
been
the
product
of
vindictiveness
and
no
reason
can
be
put
forth
for
the
sentence
increase,
then
the
plea--
the
sentence
should
be
set
aside.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
he’s
first
sentence,
your
honor,
or
first
conviction?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
his
first
conviction
was
set
aside.
i
believe
it
would’ve
been
in
1967.
i
believe,
1967,
and
the
subsequent--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
there
is,
your
honor,
the
very
basic
procedure
we
have
for
challenging
the
validity
of
a
guilty
plea
itself.
that
is
a
voluntary--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
you
can,
your
honor.
you
can
appeal
anything
you
want
and
challenge
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
itself
because
michigan
has
a
statute
since
1875.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
your
honor,
it’s
sort
of
yes,
you
can
do
it,
but
there’s
no
set
up
procedure
to
do
that
specifically.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
likewise,
that’s
the
contention
that
the
defendant
made
at
lionel
bradford,
that
his
testimony
at
the
trial
was
a
direct
product
of
the
coercion
he
was
under
during
the
time
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
byron
county
police
officers.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
your
honor.
there
is--
this
is
an
area
of
high
dispute
in
michigan
right
now.
there
is
some
authority
for
the
proposition
that
between
the
time
of
the
plea
and
before
sentencing,
that
there--
the
defendant
has
the--
almost
a
right
to
withdraw
the
plea,
but
he
had
to
set
forth
good
reasons
and,
after
the
plea,
the
burden
then
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
why
the
plea
itself
was
invalid,
but--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
there’s--
because
that
time
period
between
the
plea
and
the
sentence
where
he
has
more
of
a
right
to
withdraw
than
after
the
sentencing.
after
sentencing,
michigan
has
a
very
definite
date
by
which
it’s
the
normal
appellate
process
for
showing
that
the
plea
itself
was
invalid.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
not
in
the
state
of
michigan,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
issue
of--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
and
he
did
assert
innocence
once
he
got
back
to
trial.
on
that
point,
i
think
one
of
the
underlying
premises
and
difficulties
of
this
particular
case,
that
you
have
two
unique
elements
of
this
particular
case.
you
have
a
plea
trial
situation
and
you
also
have
the
situation
where
a
man
who
vacates
a
plea
goes
to
trial,
takes
the
stand,
and
testifies
in
his
own
defense.
both
of
these
were
the
main
product
which
judge
burns
used
in
increasing
the
sentence.
we
contend
that
the
first
issue,
that
is
that
he
knew
more
about
the
defendant
than
the
first
judge
in
the
matter
of
the
crime
itself,
is
not
factually
true
and
not
factually
correct.
judge
hadsol
knew
much
about
it,
if
not
more,
because
both
police
officers
testified
at
bradford’s
trial.
he
knew
more
about
the
crime
when
he
sentenced
payne
and,
in
fact,
he
said
that
at
the
sentencing
itself.
“i
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
this
particular
case
when
i
imposed
this
sentence.”
then,
the
second
judge
did,
judge
burns.
it
also
leads
up
to
the
question
of
remorse
and
the
question
of
perjury.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
we
do
not
see
any
reason
whatsoever
in
increasing
a
man’s
sentence
from
19-40
years
to
25-50
years
that
the
state
has
put
forth
as
a
valid
reason
for
doing
so.
michigan
has
indeterminate
sentencing
which
takes
into
account
all
the
vagaries
of
personality
and
character
differences
when
they
have
a
man
in
the
prison
itself.
they
have
a
psychiatric
department
at
the
prison
to
take
these
things
into
account.
also,
in
the
subsequent
conduct
scheme--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
in
michigan
also,
we
have
this--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
it
isn’t.
it’s--
we
would
contend
it’s
not
conduct
occurring,
first
of
all,
after
the
first
sentence.
it’s
nothing
over
which
a
defendant
has
any
control.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
there
may,
in
fact,
be
a
situation
where
the
judge
doesn’t
have
the
same
information
the
second
judge
has.
we
do
not
contend--
we
contend
it’s
just
not
the
kind
of
information
that
pearce
contemplated
that
when
the--
michigan
has
a
presentence
report
procedure
whereby
a
probation
officer
investigates
a
total
crime
and
then
reports
to
the
judge
for
purposes
of
sentencing.
it’s
a
very
exact
kind
of
thing
and
goes
beyond
even
analyzing
the
crime
and
goes
out
to
the
neighborhood
and
talks
the
neighbors
of
the
particular
defendant,
any
kinds
of
information.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor.
as
soon
as
we--
we
did
not
get
into
this
case
until
november
29
of
last
year
and,
as
soon
as
we
got
into
the
case,
we
made
a
motion
for
production
of
that
presentence
report.
we
also
included
in
appendix
to
our
brief
the
rule
in
judge
burns
made
on
our
motion
for
production
of
that
report.
he
denied
us
access
to
it,
and
we
also
quoted
him
to
michigan
authority.
two
cases
in
michigan
now
that
had
been
on
the
books
for
over
two
years
which
allow
the
sentencing
judge
to
release
it.
it’s
within
his
discretion.
it’s
not
mandatory
that
it’d
be
release,
but
he
has
the
right
to
release
it.
he
denied
us
access
to
that.
so,
it
puts
mr.
payne
in
the
position
of
challenging
information
that
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
what’s
in
there.
that
it’s
a
very
difficult
procedure,
at
best,
to
put
a
defendant
in
when
he’s
contemplating
an
appeal.
he
has
no
control
over
the--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
your
honor,
we
agree
with
the
basic
premise
of
williams
v.
new
york
that
you
should
have--
that
the
judge
knows
much
about
the
individual
as
he
possibly
can
when
he
sentence
him,
but
what
we’re
talking
about
here
is
the
second
sentencing
when
you
have
other
constitutional
rights
which
are
at
stake.
it’s
the
constitutional
right
to
not
only
the
defendant,
i
should
make
clear,
but
of
the
court’s
system
itself
that
there’s
a
very
good
chance
that
mr.
payne
knew
his
sentence
was
going
to
be
increased.
he
might
not
ever
have
appealed,
and
the
kind
of
activity
that
went
on
in
this
case
with
these
confessions
and
the
plea
was
a
product
of
the
confession
for
being
out
of
him
would
never
be
apparent
to
a
supervising
court.
like
we
have
in
michigan,
one
court
of
justice,
and
it’s
their
duty
to
supervise
the
lower
courts
and
if
they
are
prevented
of
this
road
of
access
to
showing
the
appellate
courts
what’s
going
in
their
lower
courts
is
denied,
then
you’re
really
perverting
the
system
of
justice
that
our
state
has
established
and
we
can’t
see
those
presentence
reports
and--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
they
are,
your
honor,
and
they
are
necessarily
so
in
many
criminal
convictions
where
a
defendant
takes
a
stand
and
asserts
his
reasons
for
or
his
explanation
of
the
charges
against
him,
and
we
contend
that’s
what
the
charge
of
perjury
is
to
take
into
account.
and,
what
you’re
allowing
here,
after
a
man
has
appealed,
a
man
has
a
right
to
exercise
his
right
to
appeal,
is
that
if
he
comes
back
to
court,
they’re
going
to
allow
to
increase
his
sentence
on
perjury
seven
years,
seven
years
he’d
already
served.
he
can
now
have
his
sentence
increased
by
seven
years
because
of
alleged
perjury
without
any
kind
of
a
hearing
without
the
ability
to
see
the
presentence
report,
upon
which,
allegedly,
this
sentence--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
i
can--
there’s
many
answers
i
can
give
to
that,
your
honor,
but
one
of
the
primary
answers
i
think
that’s
important
to
recognize
is
this
man
had
a
19-year
minimum
at
this
time,
the
40
years
in
prison.
that,
most
reports
done
in
prisons
and
precluding
the
prison’s
report
on
crime
and
correction
indicate
that
sentencing
is
not
an
exact
science
at
all,
and
this
kind
of--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
because
what
you’re
allowing
because
of
this
idea
that
because
one
judge--
the
impact
before
him
on
one
judge
is
different
than
the
impact
it
has
on
the
second
judge
necessarily
on
his
candidate
for
rehabilitation
allows
him
to
increase
his
sentence
at
seven
years,
and
the
impact
on
this
is
that
a
man
is
now
serving
in
prison.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i
do,
your
honor,
and
this
man,
the
judge
said
at
the
second
sentencing
that
his
conduct
in
prison
was
exemplary
and
that’s
the
only
thing
that
prevented
him--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
if
it’s
conduct
outside
the
prison,
as
we’re
into
this
case,
the
only
conduct
which
has
occurred
after
the
first
sentencing
which
is
alleged
perjury
that
occurred
inside
the
second
trial.
now,
the
judge
never,
in
any
of
his
affidavits,
alleged
that
the
perjury
occurred
inside
the
second
trial.
he
was
referring
to
between
the
first
instance,
those
plea
trials
in
the
first
instance,
and
the
second
trial,
that
the
allegation
that
there
was
internal
perjury
which
occurred
is
because
he
asserted
an
alibi
defense.
his
alibi
defense
was
that
his
car
was
stolen,
the
gun
was
in
the
car,
and
it
was
used
unbeknownst
to
him.
now,
if
there’s
an
allegation
of
perjury
here,
i
think
this
court
settled
many
years
ago
in
in
re
murchison
that--
which
dealt
with
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
that
a
grand
jury
proceeding
that
a
judge
can’t
be
at
one
time
the
prosecutor,
the
judge,
and
the
sentencer
in
a
given
case.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
at
the
second
sentencing,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
i
think
there
was
one
comment
that
was
made,
although
it’s
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw,
that
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief.
it
was
quoted
in
people
versus
button,
a
michigan
court
of
appeals
case,
which
talks
about
the
lack
of
remorse
which
has
the
line
that
was
drawn
which
says
you
can
take
into
account
the
positive
aspect
of
remorse,
but
you
can’t
penalize
the
man
who
stands
adamantly
before
the
court
and
protests
his
innocence
because
he
may
indeed
innocent
or
he
may
be--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct.
you
can’t
punish
him
for--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
if
i’m
wrong
in
the
fact
that
you
can’t
take
into
account
remorse?
no,
your
honor.
i
contend
that
the
situation,
the
comparison
aspect
of,
first
of
all,
that
you
can’t
use
the
comparison
aspect
between
the
first
incidence
and
the
second
incidence
on
the
issue
of
remorse
because
it’s
highly
questionable
why
he
was
remorseful
in
the
first
place
and,
internally,
that
is
whether
the
it’s
first,
second,
third,
or
fourth
sentencing
is
important
when
you
talk
about
considering
it
in
this
particular
case.
that
is
because
you
have
a
competing
right
to
appeal
on
this
particular
case,
and
any
man
who
appeals
is
thinking
about
going
to
trial
and
it
will
be
put
in
that
position
of
claiming
his
innocence
at
the
trial
itself
and
that--
which
are
necessarily
saying
is
that
the
sentence
can
be
increased.
we
think
it
is
important
that
there’s
a
difference
between
the
first
and
the
second
sentencing
on
this
remorse
issue
and,
necessarily,
a
judge--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
i
wouldn’t
chose
to
speak
for
what
the
state--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i’m
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
points
you’re
getting
at,
your
honor.
as
far
as
the
different--
the
vagaries
of
having
a
man
who
plead
guilty
then
appealing
and
having
the
plea
set
aside,
there
are
multitude
of
reasons
why
that
plea
might
be
set
aside.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no--
yes,
that’s
precisely
our
points,
your
honor,
because,
necessarily,
in
the
process
of
an
appeal
of
a
guilty
plea
that
was
improper
would
be
the
contemplation
by
the
defendant
that
he’s
going
to
trial
and
that
if
he
only
sits
there
and
does
nothing,
so
simply
as
his
lawyer
asserts
his
innocence
by
saying
“prove
my
guilt
at
this
particular
time.”
there
are
so
many
reasons
why
might
be
sitting
there
that
it’s
very
difficult
to
predict
just
to
what--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
that
and,
because
of
that
very
factor,
we
think
that
there
should
be
a
due
process
hearing
on
the
nature
of
his
changed
testimony
which
might
necessarily
exist
in
all
cases
where
a
plea
has
been
vacated
in
the
trial
of
pearce.
he’s
entitled
to
be
heard
as
to
why
it
occurred
in
this
particular
way.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
there--
well,
in
michigan,
your
honor,
you
have
a
right
to
elocution
which
the
lawyer
exercised
and
which
the
judge
recognized.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
your
honor,
at
the
first
sentencing,
he
stated
the
main
reason
why
he
was
increasing
the
sentence
was
because
he
now
knows
more
about
the
crime
than
the
first
judge
knew
about
the
crime,
and
we’re
contending
that
that
is
just
factually
incorrect
and,
because
that’s
the
major
factor
he
took
into
account,
that
the
worst
for
mr.
payne
that
can
happen
in
this
is
that
it
should
be
remanded
for
resentencing
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
the
first
judge
did
know
about
the
intervening--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
he
did.
he
sat
at
the
bradford
trial.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
your
honor.
they
held
off
sentencing
until
he
ha
testified.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
after
the
bradford
trial.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
so,
the
first
judge
knew
necessarily
all
there
was
to
know
about
this
particular
crime
itself.
now,
our
basic
contention
is
that
if
there
are
occurrences
within
the
second
trial
itself
which
might
or
might
not
amount
to
perjury,
that
because
of
this
court’s
statements
in
cases
like
morrissey
v.
brewer
and
humphrey
v.
cady,
the
recent
cases,
that
you
should
be
entitled
to
some
due
process
hearing
whenever
the
sentence
is
going
to
be
increased
or
the
terms
of
your
confinement
are
going
to
be
changed
to
give
the
defendant
to
come
forth
and
respond
to
those
claims.
in
michigan
right
now,
this
is
so
close.
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
very
close
to
in
re
murchison.
you
have
a
judge
sitting
up
there,
without
any
kind
of
any
opportunity
to
approach
the
judge,
have
the
defendant
take
the
stand
and
testify.
you
have
an
increase
of
7
years
on
the
minimum
and
20,
i
believe
it
was
10
years
on
the
maximum,
and
you
can--
that
kind
of
a
procedure
where
the
terms
of
confinement,
the
length
of
confinement
can
be
changed
without
any
kind
of
a
hearing,
i
feel,
is
just
reprehensible
under
these
fact
situations.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
we
have
no
qualms
with
the
original
sentence
being
re-imposed
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor,
but
the--
in
this
particular
case,
what
we’re
concerned
with
is
the
actual
increase
in
the
punishment
or
the
potential
for
rehabilitation
as
you
will,
of
this
particular
individual
of
seven
years.
he
had
served
at
this
particular
time
seven
years
of
imprisonment.
he
went
back
to
court
and
got
almost
basically
all
that
time
over
again
to
do,
with
no
time
given
for
that
seven
years
to
sue.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
and
it’s
that
very
danger
that
we’re
talking
about
in
this
particular
case,
and
when
you
have--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
because
what
they’re
alleging
here
is
a
separate
crime
and
they’re
giving
him
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
that
particular
crime.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
we
don’t
know--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
we
do
not
relent
for
a
minute
on
the
position
that
we
should
have
access
to
that
presentence
report
and
have
some
control
over
the
information
being
generated
by
that
particular
report.
those
cases--
we
have
over
500
cases
in
michigan
right
now
pending
in
our
office,
and
that’s
one
of
the
major
case--
issues
we
are
bringing
to
the
court’s
continually
is
the
right
to
see
that
particular
presentence
report
and
the
right
to
respond
to
the
information
within
it,
but
accepting
the
fact
that
a
presentence
officer
will
do
his
job
properly,
which
we
do
not
know
whether
it
occurred
in
this
case
or
not.
they
had
all
the
opportunity
to
do
that
at
the
first
sentencing.
now
in
this
particular
case,
after
that
first
sentencing,
his
conduct
was
exemplary
and
the
judge
noted
that
on
the
record.
that’s
what
prevented
him,
he
said,
from
giving
the
man
life
imprisonment.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s--
well,
where
else
would
he
be,
your
honor,
with
the
19--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
the
course
of
the
second
trial,
when
the
con--
when
the
potential
charge
is
one
of--
that
amounts
to
perjury,
which
at
this
particular
case
it
was.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
if
this
were
any
other
individual,
he’d
have
a
right
at
that
particular
time
to
have--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
he
read
the
transcript
of
the
first
guilty
plea?
i
would
assume
so,
from
his
conducts.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor.
he
talked
about
the
lack
of
remorse.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
we
do
inferentially,
your
honor,
in
that
we
consider
any
content--
any
consideration
of
a
lack
of
remorse
was
improper,
and
that’--
gets
to
the
point
where
he
said
“you
confessed
in
the
first
trial
and
now
you’re
not.”
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
he
didn’t
state
it
that
way
though,
your
honor,
that
“because
you
plead
not
guilty
in
this
trial,
i’m
taking
into
account
your
lack
of
remorse.”
he
referred
back
to
the
original
proceedings
in
this
particular
case
because,
as
his
first
affidavit
stated
in
this
particular
case,
of
the
many
points
he
made,
about
8
of
them
dealt
with
his
increased
knowledge
of
the
defendant
and
also
his
apparent
lack
of
remorse
that
he
had
one
time
had
expressed
for
the
shooting
of
the
two
police
officers,
and
it
was
directly
related
to
the
product
of
his
first
pleas.
there’s
no
contention
that
it
was
an
internal
to
the
second
trial
in
the
sentencing
that
he
was
entirely
consistent.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
the
verdict,
as
it
stands,
that
the
jury
found
that
he
in
fact
had
shot
the
police
officers
is,
at
this
time,
a
valid
verdict.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i
won’t
speak
for
what
mr.
payne
intends
to
do
with
that
particular
conviction
as
far
as
collateral
re-attacking
it
but,
at
this
time,
this
court
can
approach
the
conviction
as
being
valid,
the
conviction
itself.
in
that
particular
proceedings,
mr.
payne
has
indicated,
took
the
stand,
testified
as
to
why
he
didn’t
have
the
car
and
the
gun.
the
jury
chose
to
believe
the
state’s
evidence
and
you
can--
whatever
inferences
are
permissible
to
draw
from
that,
this
court,
i
think,
is
engaging
in
speculation
compared
to
the
right
he
was
attempting
to
assert
which
was
his
right
to
appeal,
his
right
to
have
a
higher
court
review
what
occurred
in
the
lower
courts
and
that,
primarily,
is
the
thrust
we’re
making.
that,
if
this
particular
court
is--
will
allow
lower
courts
to
take
into
account
internally
the
lack
of
remorse
that
he
shows
at
the
second
trial
or
compare
it
between
the
plea
and
the
trial.
that
it
is
highly
speculative
to
compare
it
to
the
rights
which
are
being
asserted
and,
also,
that
michigan’s
present
sentencing
scheme
takes
those
factors
into
account
that
the
indeterminate
sentencing,
by
its
very
nature,
is
taking
into
account
the
character
and
the
makeup
of
the
individual.
further,
i’d
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
judge
hadsol,
the
first
sentencing
judge,
on
the
issue
of
remorse
said
that
you
may
get
out
early
if
your
present
condition
continues.
he
was
implying
directly
in
there
what
the
department
of
corrections
can
do,
which
is
hold
a
man
longer
if
he’s
recalcitrant,
if
he
is
not
showing
positive
signs
to
being
able
to
return
to
the
community.
that,
judge
hadsol
was
very
aware
of
this
particular
problem,
and
to
allow
perjury
to
be--
and
i
think
it’s
very
important
to
state
here,
to
allow
perjury
and
increase
a
sentence
in
a
second
trial
is
a
very
dangerous
precedent
because
anybody
who
appeals
from
a
guilty
plea
and
then
goes
to
trial
and
states
his
reasons
and
is
convicted
would
necessarily,
under
that
implication,
be
guilty
of
perjury.
it
does
away
completely
with
the
requirements
of
trying
a
man
for
perjury,
and
that’s
a
very
dangerous
precedence
whether
you’re
talking
about
appellate
matters
or
whether
you’re
talking
about
simply
the
first
sentencing
matter.
that,
it’s
very
important
that
an
individual
feel
that
he
can
take
the
stand
and
state
what
he
wants
to
state
and
that
he
has
the
due
process
rights
following
that
particular
statement
if
he’s
going
to
be
charged
with
perjury.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
this
particular
case,
it
would’ve
been
life
imprisonment.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
a--
the
perjury
statute
in
michigan
states
that
the
maximum
15
years
imprisoned,
unless
the
charge--
the
crime
of
which
you
were
charged
was
life
imprisonment.
in
this
particular
case,
the
crime
was
life
imprisonment
potentially
and
he
carried
a
life
imprisonment.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
your
honor,
if
they
wanted
to
increase
the
sentence,
if
they
felt
that
it
was
important
for
his
sentence
to
be
increased
because
of
the
nature
of
his
perjury,
then
i
feel
they
could’ve
gone
to
trial
and
the
judge
certainly,
at
that
time,
was
free
to
give
him
up
to
life,
but
he
would’ve
at
least
had
the
opportunity
to
appear
in
court
and
test--
and
attempt
to
justify
why
he
said
what
he
did,
and
he
would
have
all
the
concomitant
rights
that
go
with
it.
he
would
have
had
at
least
a
hearing
which,
in
this
particular
case,
he
didn’t
even
get
a
hearing,
let
alone
a
trial
on
the
matter
and
to
be
in
front
of
a
jury
because,
as
i
indicated--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
not
on
the
issue
of
perjury,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that’s
why
he
takes
the
oath,
and
the
whole
point
behind
the--
if
the
oath
itself
is
not
followed,
that’s
why
we
have
a
perjury
statute
in
michigan
that
is
so
severe,
because
of
the
collateral
consequences
of
it.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
our
appendix
a,
we
have
the
motion
where
we
made--
which
we
made
for
the
production
of
the
presentence
report
and,
in
that
particular
motion
itself--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
it’s
at
page

(a)
of
our
appendix.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
of
our
brief.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
of
our
brief
on
appeal.
it’s
the
white
copy,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
on
page
3
(a)
of
that
particular
appendix,
judge
burns
states
this
court
has
followed
a
general--
a
policy,
generally,
in
sentencing,
to
tell
the
defendant
exactly
what
it
is
and
the
presentence
report
that
has
influenced
him
and
to
give
the
defendant
to
explain
or
to
correct
it.
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
relying
on
judge
burns’
statement
that
he
has
stated
all
the
reasons
why
he
increased
the
sentence,
and
there’s
nothing
in
that
particular
presentence
report.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
it’s
on
page
3
(a)
of
our
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
the
bottom
page.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i
think
it’s
clear,
your
honor,
he--
there
is
a
clear
implication
that
there
might
be
something
in
there
but,
assuming
he
filed
his
general
policy
which
he
stated
here,
then
he
would’ve
stated
all
his
reasons.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
we
assume
there
is
nothing.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
not
directly,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
we
are--
i’d
like
to
point
out
one
factor
in
this
particular
case
which
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
which
is
this
is
a
very
complex
case.
judge
burns
has
now
have
four
opportunities
to
state
why
he
sentenced
this
particular
man.
at
the
first
sentencing,
he
stated
“i’m
not
sentencing
you
because
of
your
appeal.”
then,
he
had
the
second
affidavit.
he
had
the
affidavit
in
this
court
and
at
the
opportunity
on
our
motion
for
production
of
the
presentence
report,
and
we
feel
that--
i
don’t
know
how
many
more
opportunities
a
man
should
be
given
to
state
why
he
sentenced
a
man,
but
that
it
should
be
within
the
confines
of
these
particular
affidavits.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
feel
that
there
shouldn’t--
according
to
how
i
read
his
implications,
there
should
not
be
anything
there.
but,
again
it
makes
it
difficult
for
counsel
to
approach
the
affidavit
if
this
is
the
method
it
is
to
be
employed.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
your
honor,
i--
in
that,
i
don’t
expect
there’s
anything
in
there.
if
there
is,
i
would
be
very
surprised
by
his
comments
and
i
would
object
too
if
there
is
something
in
there
or
this
court
feels
there’s
something
in
there,
not
having
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
it
because
we
made
the
good
faith
effort
to
get
it
and
told
judge
burns
that
he
had
the
power
to
release
it
to
us,
and
it
was
denied
to
us.
so,
i
assume
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
we
have
before
us
on
the
affidavits
which
the
michigan
supreme
court,
by
the
way,
requested
from
him,
his
reasons
for
the
increase.
and,
in
that
affi--
in
the
affidavit
he
gave
to
them,
whatever
he
stated,
they
found
wasn’t
enough.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
which
he
stated
the
subsequent
conduct
and
they
also--
he
also
stated
the
lack
of
remorse
and
the
contrary
testimony.
they
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
law,
that
it
was
not
enough.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s--
i
know
he
said
that,
your
honor,
and
i’m
at
a
loss
as
to--
we
did
everything
we
could
do
to
obtain
that
in
time
to
come
to
this
court,
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
it.
i
would
assume
that
in--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
michigan,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
a
very
brief
procedure.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
i
would
not.
not
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
the
first
judge
had
sat
on
the
trial
of
lionel
bradford
and
heard
all
the
testimonies.
in
fact,
both
police
officers
testified
there,
not
just
the
one
as
they
did
at
his
second
trial.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
i’m
suggesting
that
he
was
unaware
at
the
time
or
just
didn’t
take
into
account
the
fact
that
judge
hadsol
had
known
all
the
facts.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
step
into
the
conduct
area
of
the
argument
at
this
time.
however,
i
feel
there
are
a
few
responsive
notes
i’d
like
to
make
on
the
issue
of
retroactivities.
i
agree
with
the
prosecutor
when
he
states
this
is
a
very
complex
problem.
this
case
had
been
in
the
courts
now
for
over
10
years
on
various
aspects.
in
fact,
there’s
a
collateral
matter
pending
on
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
the
companion
case
to
this
case.
the
co-defendant
lionel
bradford’s
case
is
on
appeal
in
the
sixth
circuit,
again,
by
the
people
because
lionel
bradford’s
conviction
was
vacated
by
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
michigan.
the
basis
for
the
vacation
was
on
the--
that
leroy
payne’s
testimony
was
used
to
convict
lionel
bradford
and
judge
cornelius
kennedy,
in
vacating
the
conviction,
held
that
because
his
confession
was
brutally
beaten
out
of
him,
it
was
as
though
the
state
had
knowingly
used
purged
testimony
to
obtain
the
conviction
of
bradford.
this
also
would
get
into
the
conduct
argument,
but--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
reason
was
that--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
almost
a
period
now
of
10
years.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
unusual
fact
situation.
the
answer
to
that
basically
is
that
when
leroy
payne
was
picked
up
by
the
police
officers
he
was
in
the
custody
of
three
various
police
departments,
and
there’s
no
dispute
that
the
reason
for
vacating
his
guilty
plea
in
this
particular
case
was
because
the
confession
was
beaten
out
of
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
lionel
bradford’s
trial,
they
wanted
to
introduce
pictures
taken
of
leroy
payne
after
his
confessions
and
they
were
excluded
because
they
were
inflammatory,
that
he
was
in
such
a
brutally
beaten
condition.
his
thumbs
were
sprained,
his
face
was
swollen,
his
genitals
were
squeezed
until
he
was
brought
into
a
state
where
he
confessed.
all
of
the
activities
from
the
moment
he
was
picked
up
until
he
testified
in
lionel
bradford’s
trial
and
was
sentenced
were
while
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
police
department
of
a
space
of
over
five
months,
four-and-a
half
months.
and,
because
of
that
fact,
when
he
finally
did
testify
at
lionel
bradford’s
trial,
and
he
did
go
to
sentencing,
he
initially
intended
to
sue
the
police
departments
for
the
condition
in
which
the
manner
which
they
treated
him
and
he
decided
not
to
do
so,
and--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
because--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
because
the
confession
that
was
introduced
was
the
testimony
of
lionel
bradford.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that
is
leroy
payne’s.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
lionel
bradford’s
trial,
that
is,
he
took
the
stand
and
testified.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
it
was
his
testimony.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
the--
people
are
appealing
that
case
to
the
sixth
circuit.
that--
our
appendix
in
this
particular
case
has
extensive
quotations
from
the
bradford
transcript
that
show
the
manner
of
testimony
of
leroy
payne
plus
all
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers
both
had
payne’s
second
trial
or
his
first
trial,
as
it
was,
after
his
plea
and
at
lionel
bradford’s
trial,
and
it
sat
on
that
length,
for
purposes
of
comparison
to
show
that
judge
hadsol
knew
as
much
as
the
second
sentencing
judge,
judge
burns,
when
he
sentenced
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
second
sentencing,
judge
burns
said
that--
i’m
sorry,
at
the
first
sentencing,
judge
hadsol
said
that
when
he
gave
him
19-40
years
in
prison
that,
“i’m
taking
into
account
your
remorseful
condition
now,
and
if
it
continues,
you
might
get
released
early.”
because
michigan
has
indeterminate
sentencing,
it
takes
into
account
these
vagaries
of
personality
changes
which
can
occur,
and
judge
hadsol
was
well-aware
of
this.
he
was
well-aware
of
what
payne
had
said
at
his
first
trial
and
he
was
grateful
that
payne
had
decided
not
to
sue
the
police
officers,
which
he
has
not
done.
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
get
into
the--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
while
he
was
with
that--
the
reason
for
the
vacation
of
the
guilty
plea
was
because
it
was
beaten
out
of
him.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
the
first
sentencing.
it
also
followed
lionel
bradford’s
trial.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
the
same
as
a
confession
which
was
beaten
out
of
you
as
an
admission.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
the
point
is
the
same.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that--
yes,
your
honor,
that
the
guilty
plea
was
the
product
of
the
coercion
of
the
byron
county
police
officers.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
you
mean,
while
he
was
in
court,
was
he
being
coerced
at
that
particular
time?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
the
implication
is--
that’s
our
implic--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
directly,
your
honor,
i’m
without
knowledge
on
that
point.
whether
mr.
payne
would
contend
that--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that
it
was
the
product
of
the
coerced
confessions
and
that
it
directly
led
to
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
it
is
in
the
sense
that
after
the
first
convictions
and
the
guilty
plea--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
i
think
it
has
some
direct
bearing
on
whether
or
not
a
man
would
plead
guilty
knowing
that
he
had
three
confessions.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that’s
correct.
it
may
in
the
abstract
or
it
may
in
fact
have
been
a
true
plea,
although
mr.
payne,
once
he
was
out
of
the
custody
of
the
byron
county
police
officers,
did
begin
the
appellate
process
and
then,
when
he
came
back
to
trial,
he
testified
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
there
was--
the
initial
four
months
would
be,
i’d
say,
about
three
months
bef--
after
he
plead
guilty
until
the
bradford
trial,
and
then
it
would
be
a
period
of
about
two
years,
i
would
imagine,
before
the
first
plea--
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
sen--
was
made
and
that
was
in
front
of
judge
hadsol.
following
that,
there
was
a
renewed
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
front
of
judge
burns,
at
which,
judge
burns,
the
second
sentencing
judge,
granted
it.
in
between
those
two
motions
for
new
trial,
there
was
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
remand
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
for
determination
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
plea
was
made.
so,
it
would
be--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
she
didn’t
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
was
not
true
in
fact.
she
did
say
it
was
a
product
of
a
coercion
of
the
worst
circumstances
and
should
not
have
been
injected
into
the
trial
by
the
people,
knowing
these
facts
to
be
true.
if
i
may,
there
are
a
few
points
i’d
like
to
make
on
the
issue
of
retroactivity.
the--
i--
we
feel
our
brief
is
adequate
on
this
point,
but
there
are
several
points
that
should
be
brought
out.
this
issue
was
pending
on
appeal.
when
the
pearce
decision
was
released,
it
was
based
on
prior
michigan
authority.
the
case
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
when
it
was
released
two
days
subsequent
to
the
release
of
pearce,
took
into
account
peripherally
the
pearce
decision,
but
the
majority
was
a
2-1
decision
rule
that
because
the
second
sentencing
judge
knew
more
about
the
defendant
than
the
first
judge,
because
he
had
taken
a
plea,
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
prior
michigan
law
says,
very
much
like
pearce,
that
if
the
situation
is
such
that
the
sentence
might
have
been
the
product
of
vindictiveness
and
no
reason
can
be
put
forth
for
the
sentence
increase,
then
the
plea--
the
sentence
should
be
set
aside.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
he’s
first
sentence,
your
honor,
or
first
conviction?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
his
first
conviction
was
set
aside.
i
believe
it
would’ve
been
in
1967.
i
believe,
1967,
and
the
subsequent--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
there
is,
your
honor,
the
very
basic
procedure
we
have
for
challenging
the
validity
of
a
guilty
plea
itself.
that
is
a
voluntary--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
you
can,
your
honor.
you
can
appeal
anything
you
want
and
challenge
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
itself
because
michigan
has
a
statute
since
1875.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
your
honor,
it’s
sort
of
yes,
you
can
do
it,
but
there’s
no
set
up
procedure
to
do
that
specifically.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
likewise,
that’s
the
contention
that
the
defendant
made
at
lionel
bradford,
that
his
testimony
at
the
trial
was
a
direct
product
of
the
coercion
he
was
under
during
the
time
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
byron
county
police
officers.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
your
honor.
there
is--
this
is
an
area
of
high
dispute
in
michigan
right
now.
there
is
some
authority
for
the
proposition
that
between
the
time
of
the
plea
and
before
sentencing,
that
there--
the
defendant
has
the--
almost
a
right
to
withdraw
the
plea,
but
he
had
to
set
forth
good
reasons
and,
after
the
plea,
the
burden
then
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
why
the
plea
itself
was
invalid,
but--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
there’s--
because
that
time
period
between
the
plea
and
the
sentence
where
he
has
more
of
a
right
to
withdraw
than
after
the
sentencing.
after
sentencing,
michigan
has
a
very
definite
date
by
which
it’s
the
normal
appellate
process
for
showing
that
the
plea
itself
was
invalid.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
not
in
the
state
of
michigan,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
issue
of--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
and
he
did
assert
innocence
once
he
got
back
to
trial.
on
that
point,
i
think
one
of
the
underlying
premises
and
difficulties
of
this
particular
case,
that
you
have
two
unique
elements
of
this
particular
case.
you
have
a
plea
trial
situation
and
you
also
have
the
situation
where
a
man
who
vacates
a
plea
goes
to
trial,
takes
the
stand,
and
testifies
in
his
own
defense.
both
of
these
were
the
main
product
which
judge
burns
used
in
increasing
the
sentence.
we
contend
that
the
first
issue,
that
is
that
he
knew
more
about
the
defendant
than
the
first
judge
in
the
matter
of
the
crime
itself,
is
not
factually
true
and
not
factually
correct.
judge
hadsol
knew
much
about
it,
if
not
more,
because
both
police
officers
testified
at
bradford’s
trial.
he
knew
more
about
the
crime
when
he
sentenced
payne
and,
in
fact,
he
said
that
at
the
sentencing
itself.
“i
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
this
particular
case
when
i
imposed
this
sentence.”
then,
the
second
judge
did,
judge
burns.
it
also
leads
up
to
the
question
of
remorse
and
the
question
of
perjury.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
we
do
not
see
any
reason
whatsoever
in
increasing
a
man’s
sentence
from
19-40
years
to
25-50
years
that
the
state
has
put
forth
as
a
valid
reason
for
doing
so.
michigan
has
indeterminate
sentencing
which
takes
into
account
all
the
vagaries
of
personality
and
character
differences
when
they
have
a
man
in
the
prison
itself.
they
have
a
psychiatric
department
at
the
prison
to
take
these
things
into
account.
also,
in
the
subsequent
conduct
scheme--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
in
michigan
also,
we
have
this--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
it
isn’t.
it’s--
we
would
contend
it’s
not
conduct
occurring,
first
of
all,
after
the
first
sentence.
it’s
nothing
over
which
a
defendant
has
any
control.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
there
may,
in
fact,
be
a
situation
where
the
judge
doesn’t
have
the
same
information
the
second
judge
has.
we
do
not
contend--
we
contend
it’s
just
not
the
kind
of
information
that
pearce
contemplated
that
when
the--
michigan
has
a
presentence
report
procedure
whereby
a
probation
officer
investigates
a
total
crime
and
then
reports
to
the
judge
for
purposes
of
sentencing.
it’s
a
very
exact
kind
of
thing
and
goes
beyond
even
analyzing
the
crime
and
goes
out
to
the
neighborhood
and
talks
the
neighbors
of
the
particular
defendant,
any
kinds
of
information.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor.
as
soon
as
we--
we
did
not
get
into
this
case
until
november
29
of
last
year
and,
as
soon
as
we
got
into
the
case,
we
made
a
motion
for
production
of
that
presentence
report.
we
also
included
in
appendix
to
our
brief
the
rule
in
judge
burns
made
on
our
motion
for
production
of
that
report.
he
denied
us
access
to
it,
and
we
also
quoted
him
to
michigan
authority.
two
cases
in
michigan
now
that
had
been
on
the
books
for
over
two
years
which
allow
the
sentencing
judge
to
release
it.
it’s
within
his
discretion.
it’s
not
mandatory
that
it’d
be
release,
but
he
has
the
right
to
release
it.
he
denied
us
access
to
that.
so,
it
puts
mr.
payne
in
the
position
of
challenging
information
that
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
what’s
in
there.
that
it’s
a
very
difficult
procedure,
at
best,
to
put
a
defendant
in
when
he’s
contemplating
an
appeal.
he
has
no
control
over
the--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
your
honor,
we
agree
with
the
basic
premise
of
williams
v.
new
york
that
you
should
have--
that
the
judge
knows
much
about
the
individual
as
he
possibly
can
when
he
sentence
him,
but
what
we’re
talking
about
here
is
the
second
sentencing
when
you
have
other
constitutional
rights
which
are
at
stake.
it’s
the
constitutional
right
to
not
only
the
defendant,
i
should
make
clear,
but
of
the
court’s
system
itself
that
there’s
a
very
good
chance
that
mr.
payne
knew
his
sentence
was
going
to
be
increased.
he
might
not
ever
have
appealed,
and
the
kind
of
activity
that
went
on
in
this
case
with
these
confessions
and
the
plea
was
a
product
of
the
confession
for
being
out
of
him
would
never
be
apparent
to
a
supervising
court.
like
we
have
in
michigan,
one
court
of
justice,
and
it’s
their
duty
to
supervise
the
lower
courts
and
if
they
are
prevented
of
this
road
of
access
to
showing
the
appellate
courts
what’s
going
in
their
lower
courts
is
denied,
then
you’re
really
perverting
the
system
of
justice
that
our
state
has
established
and
we
can’t
see
those
presentence
reports
and--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
they
are,
your
honor,
and
they
are
necessarily
so
in
many
criminal
convictions
where
a
defendant
takes
a
stand
and
asserts
his
reasons
for
or
his
explanation
of
the
charges
against
him,
and
we
contend
that’s
what
the
charge
of
perjury
is
to
take
into
account.
and,
what
you’re
allowing
here,
after
a
man
has
appealed,
a
man
has
a
right
to
exercise
his
right
to
appeal,
is
that
if
he
comes
back
to
court,
they’re
going
to
allow
to
increase
his
sentence
on
perjury
seven
years,
seven
years
he’d
already
served.
he
can
now
have
his
sentence
increased
by
seven
years
because
of
alleged
perjury
without
any
kind
of
a
hearing
without
the
ability
to
see
the
presentence
report,
upon
which,
allegedly,
this
sentence--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
i
can--
there’s
many
answers
i
can
give
to
that,
your
honor,
but
one
of
the
primary
answers
i
think
that’s
important
to
recognize
is
this
man
had
a
19-year
minimum
at
this
time,
the
40
years
in
prison.
that,
most
reports
done
in
prisons
and
precluding
the
prison’s
report
on
crime
and
correction
indicate
that
sentencing
is
not
an
exact
science
at
all,
and
this
kind
of--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
because
what
you’re
allowing
because
of
this
idea
that
because
one
judge--
the
impact
before
him
on
one
judge
is
different
than
the
impact
it
has
on
the
second
judge
necessarily
on
his
candidate
for
rehabilitation
allows
him
to
increase
his
sentence
at
seven
years,
and
the
impact
on
this
is
that
a
man
is
now
serving
in
prison.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i
do,
your
honor,
and
this
man,
the
judge
said
at
the
second
sentencing
that
his
conduct
in
prison
was
exemplary
and
that’s
the
only
thing
that
prevented
him--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
if
it’s
conduct
outside
the
prison,
as
we’re
into
this
case,
the
only
conduct
which
has
occurred
after
the
first
sentencing
which
is
alleged
perjury
that
occurred
inside
the
second
trial.
now,
the
judge
never,
in
any
of
his
affidavits,
alleged
that
the
perjury
occurred
inside
the
second
trial.
he
was
referring
to
between
the
first
instance,
those
plea
trials
in
the
first
instance,
and
the
second
trial,
that
the
allegation
that
there
was
internal
perjury
which
occurred
is
because
he
asserted
an
alibi
defense.
his
alibi
defense
was
that
his
car
was
stolen,
the
gun
was
in
the
car,
and
it
was
used
unbeknownst
to
him.
now,
if
there’s
an
allegation
of
perjury
here,
i
think
this
court
settled
many
years
ago
in
in
re
murchison
that--
which
dealt
with
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
that
a
grand
jury
proceeding
that
a
judge
can’t
be
at
one
time
the
prosecutor,
the
judge,
and
the
sentencer
in
a
given
case.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
at
the
second
sentencing,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
i
think
there
was
one
comment
that
was
made,
although
it’s
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw,
that
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief.
it
was
quoted
in
people
versus
button,
a
michigan
court
of
appeals
case,
which
talks
about
the
lack
of
remorse
which
has
the
line
that
was
drawn
which
says
you
can
take
into
account
the
positive
aspect
of
remorse,
but
you
can’t
penalize
the
man
who
stands
adamantly
before
the
court
and
protests
his
innocence
because
he
may
indeed
innocent
or
he
may
be--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct.
you
can’t
punish
him
for--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
if
i’m
wrong
in
the
fact
that
you
can’t
take
into
account
remorse?
no,
your
honor.
i
contend
that
the
situation,
the
comparison
aspect
of,
first
of
all,
that
you
can’t
use
the
comparison
aspect
between
the
first
incidence
and
the
second
incidence
on
the
issue
of
remorse
because
it’s
highly
questionable
why
he
was
remorseful
in
the
first
place
and,
internally,
that
is
whether
the
it’s
first,
second,
third,
or
fourth
sentencing
is
important
when
you
talk
about
considering
it
in
this
particular
case.
that
is
because
you
have
a
competing
right
to
appeal
on
this
particular
case,
and
any
man
who
appeals
is
thinking
about
going
to
trial
and
it
will
be
put
in
that
position
of
claiming
his
innocence
at
the
trial
itself
and
that--
which
are
necessarily
saying
is
that
the
sentence
can
be
increased.
we
think
it
is
important
that
there’s
a
difference
between
the
first
and
the
second
sentencing
on
this
remorse
issue
and,
necessarily,
a
judge--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
i
wouldn’t
chose
to
speak
for
what
the
state--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i’m
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
points
you’re
getting
at,
your
honor.
as
far
as
the
different--
the
vagaries
of
having
a
man
who
plead
guilty
then
appealing
and
having
the
plea
set
aside,
there
are
multitude
of
reasons
why
that
plea
might
be
set
aside.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no--
yes,
that’s
precisely
our
points,
your
honor,
because,
necessarily,
in
the
process
of
an
appeal
of
a
guilty
plea
that
was
improper
would
be
the
contemplation
by
the
defendant
that
he’s
going
to
trial
and
that
if
he
only
sits
there
and
does
nothing,
so
simply
as
his
lawyer
asserts
his
innocence
by
saying
“prove
my
guilt
at
this
particular
time.”
there
are
so
many
reasons
why
might
be
sitting
there
that
it’s
very
difficult
to
predict
just
to
what--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
that
and,
because
of
that
very
factor,
we
think
that
there
should
be
a
due
process
hearing
on
the
nature
of
his
changed
testimony
which
might
necessarily
exist
in
all
cases
where
a
plea
has
been
vacated
in
the
trial
of
pearce.
he’s
entitled
to
be
heard
as
to
why
it
occurred
in
this
particular
way.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
there--
well,
in
michigan,
your
honor,
you
have
a
right
to
elocution
which
the
lawyer
exercised
and
which
the
judge
recognized.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
your
honor,
at
the
first
sentencing,
he
stated
the
main
reason
why
he
was
increasing
the
sentence
was
because
he
now
knows
more
about
the
crime
than
the
first
judge
knew
about
the
crime,
and
we’re
contending
that
that
is
just
factually
incorrect
and,
because
that’s
the
major
factor
he
took
into
account,
that
the
worst
for
mr.
payne
that
can
happen
in
this
is
that
it
should
be
remanded
for
resentencing
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
the
first
judge
did
know
about
the
intervening--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
he
did.
he
sat
at
the
bradford
trial.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
your
honor.
they
held
off
sentencing
until
he
ha
testified.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
after
the
bradford
trial.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
so,
the
first
judge
knew
necessarily
all
there
was
to
know
about
this
particular
crime
itself.
now,
our
basic
contention
is
that
if
there
are
occurrences
within
the
second
trial
itself
which
might
or
might
not
amount
to
perjury,
that
because
of
this
court’s
statements
in
cases
like
morrissey
v.
brewer
and
humphrey
v.
cady,
the
recent
cases,
that
you
should
be
entitled
to
some
due
process
hearing
whenever
the
sentence
is
going
to
be
increased
or
the
terms
of
your
confinement
are
going
to
be
changed
to
give
the
defendant
to
come
forth
and
respond
to
those
claims.
in
michigan
right
now,
this
is
so
close.
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
very
close
to
in
re
murchison.
you
have
a
judge
sitting
up
there,
without
any
kind
of
any
opportunity
to
approach
the
judge,
have
the
defendant
take
the
stand
and
testify.
you
have
an
increase
of
7
years
on
the
minimum
and
20,
i
believe
it
was
10
years
on
the
maximum,
and
you
can--
that
kind
of
a
procedure
where
the
terms
of
confinement,
the
length
of
confinement
can
be
changed
without
any
kind
of
a
hearing,
i
feel,
is
just
reprehensible
under
these
fact
situations.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
we
have
no
qualms
with
the
original
sentence
being
re-imposed
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor,
but
the--
in
this
particular
case,
what
we’re
concerned
with
is
the
actual
increase
in
the
punishment
or
the
potential
for
rehabilitation
as
you
will,
of
this
particular
individual
of
seven
years.
he
had
served
at
this
particular
time
seven
years
of
imprisonment.
he
went
back
to
court
and
got
almost
basically
all
that
time
over
again
to
do,
with
no
time
given
for
that
seven
years
to
sue.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
and
it’s
that
very
danger
that
we’re
talking
about
in
this
particular
case,
and
when
you
have--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
because
what
they’re
alleging
here
is
a
separate
crime
and
they’re
giving
him
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
that
particular
crime.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
we
don’t
know--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
we
do
not
relent
for
a
minute
on
the
position
that
we
should
have
access
to
that
presentence
report
and
have
some
control
over
the
information
being
generated
by
that
particular
report.
those
cases--
we
have
over
500
cases
in
michigan
right
now
pending
in
our
office,
and
that’s
one
of
the
major
case--
issues
we
are
bringing
to
the
court’s
continually
is
the
right
to
see
that
particular
presentence
report
and
the
right
to
respond
to
the
information
within
it,
but
accepting
the
fact
that
a
presentence
officer
will
do
his
job
properly,
which
we
do
not
know
whether
it
occurred
in
this
case
or
not.
they
had
all
the
opportunity
to
do
that
at
the
first
sentencing.
now
in
this
particular
case,
after
that
first
sentencing,
his
conduct
was
exemplary
and
the
judge
noted
that
on
the
record.
that’s
what
prevented
him,
he
said,
from
giving
the
man
life
imprisonment.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s--
well,
where
else
would
he
be,
your
honor,
with
the
19--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
the
course
of
the
second
trial,
when
the
con--
when
the
potential
charge
is
one
of--
that
amounts
to
perjury,
which
at
this
particular
case
it
was.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
if
this
were
any
other
individual,
he’d
have
a
right
at
that
particular
time
to
have--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
he
read
the
transcript
of
the
first
guilty
plea?
i
would
assume
so,
from
his
conducts.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
your
honor.
he
talked
about
the
lack
of
remorse.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
we
do
inferentially,
your
honor,
in
that
we
consider
any
content--
any
consideration
of
a
lack
of
remorse
was
improper,
and
that’--
gets
to
the
point
where
he
said
“you
confessed
in
the
first
trial
and
now
you’re
not.”
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
he
didn’t
state
it
that
way
though,
your
honor,
that
“because
you
plead
not
guilty
in
this
trial,
i’m
taking
into
account
your
lack
of
remorse.”
he
referred
back
to
the
original
proceedings
in
this
particular
case
because,
as
his
first
affidavit
stated
in
this
particular
case,
of
the
many
points
he
made,
about
8
of
them
dealt
with
his
increased
knowledge
of
the
defendant
and
also
his
apparent
lack
of
remorse
that
he
had
one
time
had
expressed
for
the
shooting
of
the
two
police
officers,
and
it
was
directly
related
to
the
product
of
his
first
pleas.
there’s
no
contention
that
it
was
an
internal
to
the
second
trial
in
the
sentencing
that
he
was
entirely
consistent.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
the
verdict,
as
it
stands,
that
the
jury
found
that
he
in
fact
had
shot
the
police
officers
is,
at
this
time,
a
valid
verdict.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i
won’t
speak
for
what
mr.
payne
intends
to
do
with
that
particular
conviction
as
far
as
collateral
re-attacking
it
but,
at
this
time,
this
court
can
approach
the
conviction
as
being
valid,
the
conviction
itself.
in
that
particular
proceedings,
mr.
payne
has
indicated,
took
the
stand,
testified
as
to
why
he
didn’t
have
the
car
and
the
gun.
the
jury
chose
to
believe
the
state’s
evidence
and
you
can--
whatever
inferences
are
permissible
to
draw
from
that,
this
court,
i
think,
is
engaging
in
speculation
compared
to
the
right
he
was
attempting
to
assert
which
was
his
right
to
appeal,
his
right
to
have
a
higher
court
review
what
occurred
in
the
lower
courts
and
that,
primarily,
is
the
thrust
we’re
making.
that,
if
this
particular
court
is--
will
allow
lower
courts
to
take
into
account
internally
the
lack
of
remorse
that
he
shows
at
the
second
trial
or
compare
it
between
the
plea
and
the
trial.
that
it
is
highly
speculative
to
compare
it
to
the
rights
which
are
being
asserted
and,
also,
that
michigan’s
present
sentencing
scheme
takes
those
factors
into
account
that
the
indeterminate
sentencing,
by
its
very
nature,
is
taking
into
account
the
character
and
the
makeup
of
the
individual.
further,
i’d
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
judge
hadsol,
the
first
sentencing
judge,
on
the
issue
of
remorse
said
that
you
may
get
out
early
if
your
present
condition
continues.
he
was
implying
directly
in
there
what
the
department
of
corrections
can
do,
which
is
hold
a
man
longer
if
he’s
recalcitrant,
if
he
is
not
showing
positive
signs
to
being
able
to
return
to
the
community.
that,
judge
hadsol
was
very
aware
of
this
particular
problem,
and
to
allow
perjury
to
be--
and
i
think
it’s
very
important
to
state
here,
to
allow
perjury
and
increase
a
sentence
in
a
second
trial
is
a
very
dangerous
precedent
because
anybody
who
appeals
from
a
guilty
plea
and
then
goes
to
trial
and
states
his
reasons
and
is
convicted
would
necessarily,
under
that
implication,
be
guilty
of
perjury.
it
does
away
completely
with
the
requirements
of
trying
a
man
for
perjury,
and
that’s
a
very
dangerous
precedence
whether
you’re
talking
about
appellate
matters
or
whether
you’re
talking
about
simply
the
first
sentencing
matter.
that,
it’s
very
important
that
an
individual
feel
that
he
can
take
the
stand
and
state
what
he
wants
to
state
and
that
he
has
the
due
process
rights
following
that
particular
statement
if
he’s
going
to
be
charged
with
perjury.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
this
particular
case,
it
would’ve
been
life
imprisonment.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
a--
the
perjury
statute
in
michigan
states
that
the
maximum
15
years
imprisoned,
unless
the
charge--
the
crime
of
which
you
were
charged
was
life
imprisonment.
in
this
particular
case,
the
crime
was
life
imprisonment
potentially
and
he
carried
a
life
imprisonment.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
your
honor,
if
they
wanted
to
increase
the
sentence,
if
they
felt
that
it
was
important
for
his
sentence
to
be
increased
because
of
the
nature
of
his
perjury,
then
i
feel
they
could’ve
gone
to
trial
and
the
judge
certainly,
at
that
time,
was
free
to
give
him
up
to
life,
but
he
would’ve
at
least
had
the
opportunity
to
appear
in
court
and
test--
and
attempt
to
justify
why
he
said
what
he
did,
and
he
would
have
all
the
concomitant
rights
that
go
with
it.
he
would
have
had
at
least
a
hearing
which,
in
this
particular
case,
he
didn’t
even
get
a
hearing,
let
alone
a
trial
on
the
matter
and
to
be
in
front
of
a
jury
because,
as
i
indicated--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
not
on
the
issue
of
perjury,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that’s
why
he
takes
the
oath,
and
the
whole
point
behind
the--
if
the
oath
itself
is
not
followed,
that’s
why
we
have
a
perjury
statute
in
michigan
that
is
so
severe,
because
of
the
collateral
consequences
of
it.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
our
appendix
a,
we
have
the
motion
where
we
made--
which
we
made
for
the
production
of
the
presentence
report
and,
in
that
particular
motion
itself--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
it’s
at
page
1
(a)
of
our
appendix.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
of
our
brief.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
of
our
brief
on
appeal.
it’s
the
white
copy,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
on
page
3
(a)
of
that
particular
appendix,
judge
burns
states
this
court
has
followed
a
general--
a
policy,
generally,
in
sentencing,
to
tell
the
defendant
exactly
what
it
is
and
the
presentence
report
that
has
influenced
him
and
to
give
the
defendant
to
explain
or
to
correct
it.
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
relying
on
judge
burns’
statement
that
he
has
stated
all
the
reasons
why
he
increased
the
sentence,
and
there’s
nothing
in
that
particular
presentence
report.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
it’s
on
page
3
(a)
of
our
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
the
bottom
page.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
i
think
it’s
clear,
your
honor,
he--
there
is
a
clear
implication
that
there
might
be
something
in
there
but,
assuming
he
filed
his
general
policy
which
he
stated
here,
then
he
would’ve
stated
all
his
reasons.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
we
assume
there
is
nothing.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
not
directly,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
we
are--
i’d
like
to
point
out
one
factor
in
this
particular
case
which
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
which
is
this
is
a
very
complex
case.
judge
burns
has
now
have
four
opportunities
to
state
why
he
sentenced
this
particular
man.
at
the
first
sentencing,
he
stated
“i’m
not
sentencing
you
because
of
your
appeal.”
then,
he
had
the
second
affidavit.
he
had
the
affidavit
in
this
court
and
at
the
opportunity
on
our
motion
for
production
of
the
presentence
report,
and
we
feel
that--
i
don’t
know
how
many
more
opportunities
a
man
should
be
given
to
state
why
he
sentenced
a
man,
but
that
it
should
be
within
the
confines
of
these
particular
affidavits.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
feel
that
there
shouldn’t--
according
to
how
i
read
his
implications,
there
should
not
be
anything
there.
but,
again
it
makes
it
difficult
for
counsel
to
approach
the
affidavit
if
this
is
the
method
it
is
to
be
employed.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
well,
your
honor,
i--
in
that,
i
don’t
expect
there’s
anything
in
there.
if
there
is,
i
would
be
very
surprised
by
his
comments
and
i
would
object
too
if
there
is
something
in
there
or
this
court
feels
there’s
something
in
there,
not
having
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
it
because
we
made
the
good
faith
effort
to
get
it
and
told
judge
burns
that
he
had
the
power
to
release
it
to
us,
and
it
was
denied
to
us.
so,
i
assume
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
we
have
before
us
on
the
affidavits
which
the
michigan
supreme
court,
by
the
way,
requested
from
him,
his
reasons
for
the
increase.
and,
in
that
affi--
in
the
affidavit
he
gave
to
them,
whatever
he
stated,
they
found
wasn’t
enough.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
which
he
stated
the
subsequent
conduct
and
they
also--
he
also
stated
the
lack
of
remorse
and
the
contrary
testimony.
they
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
law,
that
it
was
not
enough.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s--
i
know
he
said
that,
your
honor,
and
i’m
at
a
loss
as
to--
we
did
everything
we
could
do
to
obtain
that
in
time
to
come
to
this
court,
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
it.
i
would
assume
that
in--
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
in
michigan,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
a
very
brief
procedure.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
no,
i
would
not.
not
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
the
first
judge
had
sat
on
the
trial
of
lionel
bradford
and
heard
all
the
testimonies.
in
fact,
both
police
officers
testified
there,
not
just
the
one
as
they
did
at
his
second
trial.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
i’m
suggesting
that
he
was
unaware
at
the
time
or
just
didn’t
take
into
account
the
fact
that
judge
hadsol
had
known
all
the
facts.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
james
r.
neuhard
thank
you.
