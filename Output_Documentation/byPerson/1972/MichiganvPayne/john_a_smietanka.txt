mr.
john
a.
smietanka
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
criminal
case
are
a
bit
complex.
essentially,
they
arise
from
an
incident
which
occurred
in
benton
harbor,
michigan
on
november
5,
1962.
two
police
officers
were
driving
in
their
patrol
car,
stopped
a
pontiac
automobile,
got
out
of
their
automobile
and,
as
they
were
walking
up
to
the
pontiac,
the
driver
and
passenger
of
that
vehicle
jumped
out
and
began
firing
at
them
striking
both
officers,
critically
wounding
both.
both
did
survive.
later
that
day,
incidentally,
it
might
be
noted
at
this
point
that
after
the
officers
have
been
hit,
they
did
fire
their
guns
at
the
retreating
vehicle,
pontiac.
later
that
day,
leroy
payne,
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
arrested,
a
confession
was
obtained
from
him
illegally,
and
before
judge
phil
hadsol,
the
byron
county
circuit
court,
he
pled
guilty
on
december
14,
1962.
in
february
1963,
he
gave
testimony
against
his
co-defendant,
lionel
bradford.
in
march
8,
1963,
he
was
sentenced
to
19-40
years
by
judge
hadsol.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
he
did.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
it
was
not.
subsequently,
in
1967,
mr.
payne
appealed
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
in
may
12th
of
that
year,
1967,
the
remand
order
was
entered
by
that
court
to
the
byron
county
circuit
court
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
his
confession
and
the
voluntariness
of
his
plea.
then,
circuit
judge
chester
burns
conducted
that
evidentiary
hearing
in
1967,
suppressed
the
confession,
vacated
the
plea,
and
set
the
case
down
for
preliminary
examination,
whereupon,
it
proceeded
normally
to
trial.
prior
to
trial,
the
same
circuit
judge,
upon
motion
of
the
defendant,
granted
the
change
of
venue
to
grand
rapids
which
is
kent
county,
michigan.
at
the
trial,
certain
evidence
was
entered
by
the
people
and
by
the
defense.
i
will
get
to
that
evidence
later
in
my
argument,
if
it
please
the
court.
he
was
convicted
by
a
jury
selected
from
kent
county.
he
was
sentenced
on
august
30,
1967
to
a
term
of
25-50
years.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
confession
was
not
entered
because
judge
burns
specifically
suppressed
it
and--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no
mention
as
to
be
made
of
any--
there
is
an
agreement
prior
to
trial,
it’s
my
understanding,
and
order
of
the
court
that
no
mention
was
to
be
made
either
of
his
confession
or
his
plea
or
the
testimony
before
judge
hadsol
in
the
bradford
trial,
and
none
was
made.
in
fact,
there
was
great
deal
of
cross-examination
in
the
second
trial
which
led
up
to,
but
did
not
come--
did
not
even
in
the
remote
sense
mentioned,
the
fact
that
he
had
testified
in
the
prior
trial
or
of
any
prior
proceedings.
there
was
no
notification,
no
notice
of
any
prior
proceedings
given
to
the
jury
or
anything
that
have
happened
in
those
prior
proceedings.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
by
virtue
of
an
order
of
the
court,
i
recall.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
it--
i’m
not
sure
how
the--
exactly
the
order
was
formulated,
whether
it
was
by
stipulation
of
counsel,
which
i
believe
was
the
case,
and
the
court
ordered--
made
an
order
based
on
that
understanding.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
it
may
have
been
recorded--
it
may
have
been
done
in
chambers
and
it
may
not
have
been
formally
filed,
but
that
was
the
case.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
judge
was,
your
honor,
because
the--
he
was
the
one
who
had
vacated
the
prior
conviction.
he
has--
he
was,
as
i
said,
sentenced
to
25-50
years
in
michigan
department
of
corrections.
on
june
23--
pardon
me,
he
did
appeal
that
conviction,
raising
as
one
of
the
grounds
an
excessive
sentence
the
second
time
around.
on
june
23,
1969,
this
court
delivered
the
decision
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
two
days
later,
june
25,
1969,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
affirmed
both
the
conviction
and
the
sentence,
that
is,
a
sentence
of
judge
burns.
the
michigan
supreme
court
granted
leave
and,
apparently,
unanimously
affirmed
the
conviction,
but
in
a
4-3
decision
and
reversed
the
sentence
based
on
an--
their
interpretation,
the
michigan
supreme
court’s
interpretation,
of
the
requirements
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
october
16,
1972.
the
primary
issue,
which
is
actually
the
last
issue
that
i’ve
raised
in
my
brief,
is
that
of
the
retroactivity
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
can
agree
that
the
sentence
was
properly
imposed
technically.
the--
it
was
well
within
the
statutory
maximum,
that
is
the
statutory
maximum
in
michigan
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder
is
life
imprisoned.
there
are
two
issues
dealt
with
by
the
court
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
first
is
that
of
sentencing.
pardon
me,
first
is
that
of
credit
to
be
given
to
a
person
who
has
appealed
a
conviction
and
been
resentenced.
he
must
be
given
credit.
this
was
posited
and
based
on
the
ex
parte
lang
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
the
second
issue--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that
issue
is
not
here,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no
question
of
that.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
second
issue
is
that
of
whether
or
not
a
higher
sentence
could
be
imposed
on
the
second
sentence
after
a
successful
appeal.
the
court
in
pearce,
of
course,
specifically
eliminated
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
and
equal
protection
clauses
as
being
a
bar
to
that
sentence,
that
increased
sentence,
but
this
say
that
due
process
requires
that
certain--
that
these
sentences
be
protected
or
be
governed
by
certain
rules,
a
certain
rule,
namely
that,
first
of
all,
it’d
be
based
on
objective
identifiable
conduct
occurring
after
the
first
sentence
and,
secondly,
that
that
conduct
must
appear
on
the
record.
on
january
16
of
this
year,
this
court
delivered
an
opinion
in
the
case
of
robinson
versus
neil,
in
which
it
cited
pearce
without
mentioning
exactly
the--
specifically
defining
how
it
cited,
but
it
note
that
pearce
indicated
that
benton
versus
maryland
should
be
applied
retroactively.
the
mentioning
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
we
fee,
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
was
intended
to
deal
with
the
double
jeopardy
aspect
of
pearce,
that
is
the
sent--
the
creditor
time
served.
further
in
that
decision
in
robinson,
this
court
noted
that
there
is
some
conflict
or
a
difficulty
of
understanding
the
retroactivity
and
prospectivity
rulings
of
this
court,
and
referred
the
readers
and
the--
to
the
thrust
of
the
desist
versus
united
states
as
summarizing
the
linkletter
type
criteria
and
said
that,
first
of
all,
we
must
look
to
determine
whether
the
linkletter
criteria
apply
to
the
question
of
what
right
are
we
dealing
with?
what
right
or
what
privilege
newly
defined
are
we
dealing
with?
then,
we
must
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
desist
also
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
newly
defined,
is
the
most
important
aspect.
looking
at
the
particular
right
that
we
have,
that
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause,
this
court
has
not
held
that,
in
it
of
itself,
solely
by
citing
and
by
using--
having
a
right
affected
by
the
due
process
clause
does
not,
in
it
of
itself,
require
retroactivity.
a
particular
rule
or
particular--
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
a
particular
rule
may
indicate
that
retroactivity
should
take
place,
but
it
does
not
require
it.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
michigan
that
the
linkletter
criteria
should
be
applied
here
for
the
following
reasons.
first
of
all,
that,
as
i
said,
the
due
process
clause
does
not,
in
it
of
itself,
require
retroactivity,
as
would,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
noted,
as
it
would
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
waller
versus
florida.
essentially,
the
due
process
clause,
in
the
way
it
was
applied
in
this
case,
assures
fairness,
basic
simple
fairness,
in
the
imposition
of
a
second
sentence.
we
then
move
to
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
essentially,
there
are
two
purposes
for
the
north
carolina
versus
pearce
decision.
there
are
two
things
that
the
court
wanted
to
protect.
first
of
all,
that
is
the
appellate
process,
that
is,
there
should
not
be
any
unreasonable
impediment
to
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
appeal
granted
in
this
case
by
a
state.
the
court,
as
i
recall,
has
not
stated
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
appeal
but,
when
it
is
applied,
it
must
be
applied--
there
must
be
equal
access
to
the
courts,
there
must
be
no
unreasonable
distinctions.
and,
the
unreasonable
distinction
here
is
a
reasonable
fear
that
a
second
sentencing
judge
will
act
indicatively
against
a
particular
defendant.
the
second
purpose
is
to
prevent,
to
deter,
improper
vindictive
sentences
upon
defendants
solely
because
they
have
appealed
and
want
a
new
trial.
now,
how
do
we
apply
the
pearce
case
and
how
does
it
fit
within
this
question
of
retroactivity?
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
sir.
no,
judge
philip
hadsol
was--
imposed
the
first
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
and
judge
chester
burns
imposed
the
second
sentence.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
there
are
certain
factors--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
he
was--
their
case
was
remanded
from
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and,
at
that
evidentiary
hearing
or
after
it,
he
decided,
first,
that
the
order--
that
the
confession
should
be
suppressed,
the
plea
vacated,
and
it
was
set
for
a
new
preliminary
examination
which
was
held
and
proceeded
to
trial.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
the
second
thing
which
we
are
trying
to
prevent
or
the
court
is
trying
to
prevent
in
pearce
is
the
vindictive
sentencing.
how
do
we
go
about
handling
it?
first
of
all,
the
court
said
that
the
type
of
material,
the
factors
to
be
considered
by
a
judge
imposing
a
second
sentence
should
be
limited
to
objective
identifiable
conduct
occurring
after
the
first
sentence.
actually
it
didn’t
say
“limited
to
it,”
it
said
“based
upon.”
and,
secondly,
there’s
a
record
making
requirement,
that
is,
this
material
must
be
placed
on
the
record
so
that
a
higher
court
can
review
that
the
bases
for
sufficiency.
now,
retroactivity,
it’s
our
contention,
will
not
further
either
of
these
goals.
first
of
all,
those
who
have
been,
in
the
past,
deterred
from
appealing
are
not
going
to
be--
have
their
wrongs
righted
by
the
retroactivity
of
pearce
to
those
cases
where
those
who
did
appeal
had
their--
had
a
higher
sentence
imposed,
that
is,
the
actual
wrong
that
the
court
is
dealing
with
is
the
reasonable
fear
of
those--
the
deterrence
of
those
who
want
to
appeal
but
are
afraid
to
appeal.
these
are
the
people
who
have
suffered
the
appellate
wrong
that
pearce
was
trying
to
avoid.
now,
making
these
cases
retroactive,
making
this
case
retroactive
to
handle
those--
where
the
defendant
did
appeal
obviously,
those
who
were
afraid
will
never
have
justice
done
to
them.
secondly,
the
prospective
application
of
pearce
will
satisfy
each
of
the--
satisfy
this
appellate
and
of
pearce,
that
is,
from
now
on
we
know,
we
being--
we
convicted
of
crimes,
we
know
that
we
will
not
be
subject
to
a
vindictive
sentence
the
second
time
around
and
we
now
can
prosecute
our
appeals.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
if
that
case--
if
pearce
were
to
be
retroactively
applied,
it
would
have
to
be
logically
a
question
of
each
person
who
was
sentenced
would
then
have
a
right
to
say--
come
in
and
say,
“well,
i
was
deterred
because
of
the
fear
of
reasonable--
unreasonable
increase
in
sentence
and,
therefore,
hear
my
appeal,”
thus,
reopening
or
opening
for
the
first
time
each
sentence
at
least
and
each
conviction
that
has
ever
taken
place,
in
which
the
defendant
presumably
is
still
alive.
thus,
the
proof
problems
would
be
immense
and,
furthermore,
pearce--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i’m
sorry--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
have
no
figures,
your
honor,
except
for
figures
which
were
cited
in
the
appendix
to
walsh
versus
commonwealth
dealing
there,
not
with
the
type
of
review
we
have
here,
the
type
of
sentence
we
have
here,
but
appellate
review
of
sentencing.
this
came
about
in
the--
under
the
massachusetts
rule
and,
in
that,
there
are
many,
many
statistics.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
well,
in
minneap--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
well,
the
flood,
your
honor,
would
come
from
every
single
conviction.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
if
a
person
could
conceivably--
for
example,
a
person
is
convicted,
100
people
are
convicted--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
don’t
know
how
many
there
are.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
there
are
some.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
think
they
would
be,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
because
the
appellate
purpose
of
pearce
is
to
avoid
the
fear
of
a
higher
sentence.
if
a
person
in
jail,
in
prison,
does
not
appeal,
it
may
be
for
a
number
of
reasons.
for
example,
he
might
be
satisfied
with
his
conviction,
satisfied
to
justice
done,
but
one
reason--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that
could
be,
your
honor.
furthermore,
the
sentencing
process
is
to
be
protected
by
pearce
and
there
were--
the
real
bugaboo,
the
real
evil,
is
a
question
of
actual
vindictiveness.
now,
that
is
actual
vindictiveness
for
having
taken
an
appeal,
and
the
way
the
court
handled
that
was
to
formulate
a
rule
of,
basically,
constructive
vindictiveness.
the
court
said
“alright,
if
these
criteria
which
we’re
laying
down
are
not
met
then,
in
effect,
we
are
construing,
we
are
saying
that
this
sentence
is
reversible
because
it
is
not--
it
is
technically,
it
is
based
on
a
vindictive
type
of
sentencing.
it
is
constructive
vindictiveness,
but
we
are
actually
trying
to
avoid
actual
vindictiveness
and
like
actual
police
misconduct,
the
type
of
conduct
we
had
in
mapp
versus
ohio.
we’re
talking
here
about
deterrence
of
that
behavior,
and
retroactive
application
of
pearce
is
not
going
to
enhance
the
deterrent
effect
of
pearce.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
will.
[luncheon
break]
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
questions
that
i
was
requested
to
confine
my
remarks
to,
basically,
what
type
of
behavior
was
indicated
as--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
it
is
but,
primarily,
i’d
like
to
deal
with
the
two
items.
there
is
an
affidavit,
two
affidavits,
in
the
petitioner’s
appendix
found
on
pages
17
through
21.
these
are
from
judge
burns.
one
was
supplied
to
the
request
of
the
michigan
supreme
court,
the
other
he
submitted
to
clarify
one
matter
in
this
court.
basically,
they
could
be
boiled
down
to
two
things.
first
of
all,
the--
he
felt
that
the
behavior
of
mr.
payne
at
the
trial
warranted
an
increase
in
sentence,
namely
after
receiving
a
new
trial,
he
came
in
and
the
judge
concluded
and,
we
believe
the
jury
must
have
concluded,
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
because
of
the
following
reasons.
the
evidence
presented
by
the
people
was
as
follows.
first
of
all,
vick
yost,
the
victim,
made
an
incorrect
identification
of
the
defendant
as
the
one
who
shot
him.
he
had
known
him
before
and
saw
him,
recognized
him
when
the
shots
were
being
fired,
and
testified
that
way
in
court.
furthermore,
when
he
was
laying
on
the
street
and
the
first
officers
came
up
to
the
scene
and
asked
“who
shot
you?”
and
it
was
testified
that
vick
said
“leroy
payne.”
“the
license
number?”
then,
he
gave
the
license
number
of
the
car,
“rb2599.”
that
car,
when
it
drove
away,
had
been
fired
at
by
the
officers,
bullet
hole--
pardon
me,
fired
at
the
returning
vehicle.
they
found
the
car
later,
the
same
license
number,
four
bullet
holes
in
the
trunk
of
the
car,
and
that
car
was
leroy
payne’s.
next,
the
assault
weapon
was
found,
and
leroy
payne’s
fingerprint
was
found
on
it.
against
this,
defendant
testified
to
an
alibi,
namely,
“i
was
at
home
during
the
time--
at
all
time--
i
was
home
in
bed
during
the
time
the
shooting
took
place.
i
did
not
shoot
vick
yost.
i
did
not
drive
my
car
that
night.”
the
jury,
in
finding
the
man
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
must
have
found
that
the
testimony
of
mr.
payne
was
untrue.
that,
in
many
case,
in
insanity
defenses,
and
many
other
types
of
defenses,
this
is
not
the
case,
but
when
there’s
an
alibi
defense
and
especially
in
this
case
where
it
is
so
clearly--
the
positions
of
the
two
parties
are
so
clearly
defined,
the
verdict
of
the
jury
was
that
he
was
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
it
must’ve
included
the
fact
finding
that
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
sir.
that
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
second
point.
taking
this
type
of
behavior
at
the
second
trial
together
with
the
completely
different
approach
that
mr.
payne
took
at
the
first
trial
and
that--
you’ll
notice
in
the
appendix
on
pages
6
through
8,
the
sentencing
transcript
of
judge
hadsol.
he
specifically
notes
the
type--
the
approach
that
this
defendant
had
taken,
confessing
his
crime,
made
him
a
very
appli--
appt
candidate
for
rehabilitation.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
that’s
not
the
case,
your
honor.
my
position
here--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
in--
there’s
a
difference,
your
honor,
we
believe,
between
maintaining
a
person’s
innocence.
that
is
a
legal
conclusion.
as
i
can
say
i’m
innocent,
but
not
come
in
and
testify
to
facts
which
are--
specific
facts
which
are
not
true.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
if
the
case--
i
know,
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
co-defendant,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
because
i’m
dealing
with
a
question
of
the
same
person.
we’re
dealing
with
the
same
person.
at
one
time
in
1963,
having
one
attitude
and
an--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
for
behavior--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
for
behavior
which
he
had
exhibited
after
that
first
sentence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
the
purpose
was
not
that
he’d
go
back
and
plead
guilty
again.
it
was
to
have
a
fair
trial,
which
he
received.
in
the
course
of
that
trial,
he
exhibited
conduct
which
we
contend
is
detrimental
conduct,
that
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that
is,
testifying
falsely.
we
believe
that
this
court
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
your
honor,
the--
a
determination--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
we
do.
we
do
not
charge
him
with
perjury
because
of
the--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
case?
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
but,
in
finding
that
they
agree
with
the
state,
they
have
to
completely
disregard
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
well--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
we
should
note--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
sir,
and
all
the
testimony
has
to
do
is
to
lead
to
that
conclusion.
basically,
the
sentence
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
difference,
i
believe,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
your
honor--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
believe,
your
honor,
it’s
his
conduct
which
would
indicate
a
certain
something
about
his
character
which
the
judge
could
take
into
consideration
in
imposing
a
higher
sentence,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
he
took
into
consideration
that
the
jury
found
he
was
not
telling
the
truth,
and
this
indicated
something
about
his
character,
a
change
in
his
character
which
had
to
do
with
the
length
of
the
sentence
which
had
been
imposed.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that
is
not
what
we
require
defendants,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
facts
were
slightly
different
and
that
is
that,
and
this
is
something
that
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
notice
and
that
was
that,
judge
hadsol
had
presided
at
the
trial
of
bradford
before
he
sentenced
payne.
so,
he
heard
payne
testifying.
that’s--
we
don’t
dispute
that.
he
did--
was
available--
was
aware
of
the
facts
of
bradford
and
payne
during
the
payne
trial
or
at
the
payne
sentence.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
he
may
have.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
he
didn’t
specifically
state
that.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
you
don’t,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
with
regards
to
the
case
of
the
presentence
report,
in
the
argument
before
judge
burns
and
prior
to
it,
in
the
formal
argument,
the
actual
argument
before
him,
before
the
final
ruling
was
put
in
the
record
and
included
in
the
appendix,
it
was
suggested
to
mr.
benson
by
myself
and
also,
i
believe,
by
the
judge
that
we
would
have
no
objection
and
we
suggested
that
he
come
up
to
this
court
and
say--
request
the
court
to
free
this--
to
bring
this
presentence
report
to
this
court,
and
so
it’s
not
a
question
of
exhausting
all
alternatives
because
that
alternative
was
suggested
to
him.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
this
would
then
put
the
burden
on
this
court.
if
the
court
wanted
the
defendant
to
have
a
copy
of
it,
the
judge
would
have
no
objection--
could
have
no
objection.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
the
way
the
ruling
was
made,
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
it
was
that
because
of
judge
burns’
feelings
on
the
matter
of
disclosure
of
presentence
reports
which
eh
included
in
his
ruling,
the
reasons
why
he
feels
they
should
be
confidential
and
to--
namely
to
protect
the
sources
of
the
information
and
not
to
have
these
sources
dry
up
and
to
give
the
judges
as
much
latitude
as
possible
to
consider
information,
both
favorable
and
unfavorable,
to
the
defendant.
with
regards
to
the
time
between
the
original
plea
and
the
original--
pardon
me,
the
original
sentence
and
the
original
appeal,
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
how
long
that
was.the
record
will
indicate
it
was
three
years.
the
case
of
murchison
was
cited
several
times
and
we
feel
that
it’s
not
applicable
at
all.
in
that
case,
we’re
dealing
with
the
determination
by
the
same
judge
and
only
by
that
judge
of
whether
or
not
perjury
had
been
committed.
when
the
first
determination
was
made
or
the
perjured
statement
or
the
alleged
perjured
statement
was
made
in
a
one-man
grand
juror
situation,
there
was
only
one
person
there
to
hear
the
perjury,
and
that
was
the
one-man
grand
juror
himself
and
the
court
required
that
that
type
of
proceeding
required
a
full
hearing
by
another
judge
for
the
contempt
citation
to
stand.
and
furthermore,
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
perjury,
i’m
not
absolutely
sure,
but
i
believe
that
the
law
in
michigan
as
it
stood
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial
or
the
trial
was
not
because
it
was
punishable
by
life
but
rather
by
15
years
and
that
it
was
subsequently
amended
to
make
it
life.
i
believe
there’s
some
question
in
that
area,
but
the--
i
do
not
know
the
citation
of
that.
i
can’t
give
it
to
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
criminal
case
are
a
bit
complex.
essentially,
they
arise
from
an
incident
which
occurred
in
benton
harbor,
michigan
on
november
5,
1962.
two
police
officers
were
driving
in
their
patrol
car,
stopped
a
pontiac
automobile,
got
out
of
their
automobile
and,
as
they
were
walking
up
to
the
pontiac,
the
driver
and
passenger
of
that
vehicle
jumped
out
and
began
firing
at
them
striking
both
officers,
critically
wounding
both.
both
did
survive.
later
that
day,
incidentally,
it
might
be
noted
at
this
point
that
after
the
officers
have
been
hit,
they
did
fire
their
guns
at
the
retreating
vehicle,
pontiac.
later
that
day,
leroy
payne,
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
arrested,
a
confession
was
obtained
from
him
illegally,
and
before
judge
phil
hadsol,
the
byron
county
circuit
court,
he
pled
guilty
on
december
14,
1962.
in
february
1963,
he
gave
testimony
against
his
co-defendant,
lionel
bradford.
in
march
8,
1963,
he
was
sentenced
to
19-40
years
by
judge
hadsol.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
he
did.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
it
was
not.
subsequently,
in
1967,
mr.
payne
appealed
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
in
may
12th
of
that
year,
1967,
the
remand
order
was
entered
by
that
court
to
the
byron
county
circuit
court
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
his
confession
and
the
voluntariness
of
his
plea.
then,
circuit
judge
chester
burns
conducted
that
evidentiary
hearing
in
1967,
suppressed
the
confession,
vacated
the
plea,
and
set
the
case
down
for
preliminary
examination,
whereupon,
it
proceeded
normally
to
trial.
prior
to
trial,
the
same
circuit
judge,
upon
motion
of
the
defendant,
granted
the
change
of
venue
to
grand
rapids
which
is
kent
county,
michigan.
at
the
trial,
certain
evidence
was
entered
by
the
people
and
by
the
defense.
i
will
get
to
that
evidence
later
in
my
argument,
if
it
please
the
court.
he
was
convicted
by
a
jury
selected
from
kent
county.
he
was
sentenced
on
august
30,
1967
to
a
term
of
25-50
years.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
confession
was
not
entered
because
judge
burns
specifically
suppressed
it
and--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no
mention
as
to
be
made
of
any--
there
is
an
agreement
prior
to
trial,
it’s
my
understanding,
and
order
of
the
court
that
no
mention
was
to
be
made
either
of
his
confession
or
his
plea
or
the
testimony
before
judge
hadsol
in
the
bradford
trial,
and
none
was
made.
in
fact,
there
was
great
deal
of
cross-examination
in
the
second
trial
which
led
up
to,
but
did
not
come--
did
not
even
in
the
remote
sense
mentioned,
the
fact
that
he
had
testified
in
the
prior
trial
or
of
any
prior
proceedings.
there
was
no
notification,
no
notice
of
any
prior
proceedings
given
to
the
jury
or
anything
that
have
happened
in
those
prior
proceedings.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
by
virtue
of
an
order
of
the
court,
i
recall.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
it--
i’m
not
sure
how
the--
exactly
the
order
was
formulated,
whether
it
was
by
stipulation
of
counsel,
which
i
believe
was
the
case,
and
the
court
ordered--
made
an
order
based
on
that
understanding.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
it
may
have
been
recorded--
it
may
have
been
done
in
chambers
and
it
may
not
have
been
formally
filed,
but
that
was
the
case.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
judge
was,
your
honor,
because
the--
he
was
the
one
who
had
vacated
the
prior
conviction.
he
has--
he
was,
as
i
said,
sentenced
to
25-50
years
in
michigan
department
of
corrections.
on
june
23--
pardon
me,
he
did
appeal
that
conviction,
raising
as
one
of
the
grounds
an
excessive
sentence
the
second
time
around.
on
june
23,
1969,
this
court
delivered
the
decision
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
two
days
later,
june
25,
1969,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
affirmed
both
the
conviction
and
the
sentence,
that
is,
a
sentence
of
judge
burns.
the
michigan
supreme
court
granted
leave
and,
apparently,
unanimously
affirmed
the
conviction,
but
in
a
4-3
decision
and
reversed
the
sentence
based
on
an--
their
interpretation,
the
michigan
supreme
court’s
interpretation,
of
the
requirements
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
october
16,
1972.
the
primary
issue,
which
is
actually
the
last
issue
that
i’ve
raised
in
my
brief,
is
that
of
the
retroactivity
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
can
agree
that
the
sentence
was
properly
imposed
technically.
the--
it
was
well
within
the
statutory
maximum,
that
is
the
statutory
maximum
in
michigan
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder
is
life
imprisoned.
there
are
two
issues
dealt
with
by
the
court
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
first
is
that
of
sentencing.
pardon
me,
first
is
that
of
credit
to
be
given
to
a
person
who
has
appealed
a
conviction
and
been
resentenced.
he
must
be
given
credit.
this
was
posited
and
based
on
the
ex
parte
lang
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
the
second
issue--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that
issue
is
not
here,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no
question
of
that.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
second
issue
is
that
of
whether
or
not
a
higher
sentence
could
be
imposed
on
the
second
sentence
after
a
successful
appeal.
the
court
in
pearce,
of
course,
specifically
eliminated
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
and
equal
protection
clauses
as
being
a
bar
to
that
sentence,
that
increased
sentence,
but
this
say
that
due
process
requires
that
certain--
that
these
sentences
be
protected
or
be
governed
by
certain
rules,
a
certain
rule,
namely
that,
first
of
all,
it’d
be
based
on
objective
identifiable
conduct
occurring
after
the
first
sentence
and,
secondly,
that
that
conduct
must
appear
on
the
record.
on
january
16
of
this
year,
this
court
delivered
an
opinion
in
the
case
of
robinson
versus
neil,
in
which
it
cited
pearce
without
mentioning
exactly
the--
specifically
defining
how
it
cited,
but
it
note
that
pearce
indicated
that
benton
versus
maryland
should
be
applied
retroactively.
the
mentioning
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
we
fee,
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
was
intended
to
deal
with
the
double
jeopardy
aspect
of
pearce,
that
is
the
sent--
the
creditor
time
served.
further
in
that
decision
in
robinson,
this
court
noted
that
there
is
some
conflict
or
a
difficulty
of
understanding
the
retroactivity
and
prospectivity
rulings
of
this
court,
and
referred
the
readers
and
the--
to
the
thrust
of
the
desist
versus
united
states
as
summarizing
the
linkletter
type
criteria
and
said
that,
first
of
all,
we
must
look
to
determine
whether
the
linkletter
criteria
apply
to
the
question
of
what
right
are
we
dealing
with?
what
right
or
what
privilege
newly
defined
are
we
dealing
with?
then,
we
must
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
desist
also
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
newly
defined,
is
the
most
important
aspect.
looking
at
the
particular
right
that
we
have,
that
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause,
this
court
has
not
held
that,
in
it
of
itself,
solely
by
citing
and
by
using--
having
a
right
affected
by
the
due
process
clause
does
not,
in
it
of
itself,
require
retroactivity.
a
particular
rule
or
particular--
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
a
particular
rule
may
indicate
that
retroactivity
should
take
place,
but
it
does
not
require
it.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
michigan
that
the
linkletter
criteria
should
be
applied
here
for
the
following
reasons.
first
of
all,
that,
as
i
said,
the
due
process
clause
does
not,
in
it
of
itself,
require
retroactivity,
as
would,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
noted,
as
it
would
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
waller
versus
florida.
essentially,
the
due
process
clause,
in
the
way
it
was
applied
in
this
case,
assures
fairness,
basic
simple
fairness,
in
the
imposition
of
a
second
sentence.
we
then
move
to
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
essentially,
there
are
two
purposes
for
the
north
carolina
versus
pearce
decision.
there
are
two
things
that
the
court
wanted
to
protect.
first
of
all,
that
is
the
appellate
process,
that
is,
there
should
not
be
any
unreasonable
impediment
to
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
appeal
granted
in
this
case
by
a
state.
the
court,
as
i
recall,
has
not
stated
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
appeal
but,
when
it
is
applied,
it
must
be
applied--
there
must
be
equal
access
to
the
courts,
there
must
be
no
unreasonable
distinctions.
and,
the
unreasonable
distinction
here
is
a
reasonable
fear
that
a
second
sentencing
judge
will
act
indicatively
against
a
particular
defendant.
the
second
purpose
is
to
prevent,
to
deter,
improper
vindictive
sentences
upon
defendants
solely
because
they
have
appealed
and
want
a
new
trial.
now,
how
do
we
apply
the
pearce
case
and
how
does
it
fit
within
this
question
of
retroactivity?
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
sir.
no,
judge
philip
hadsol
was--
imposed
the
first
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
and
judge
chester
burns
imposed
the
second
sentence.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
there
are
certain
factors--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
he
was--
their
case
was
remanded
from
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and,
at
that
evidentiary
hearing
or
after
it,
he
decided,
first,
that
the
order--
that
the
confession
should
be
suppressed,
the
plea
vacated,
and
it
was
set
for
a
new
preliminary
examination
which
was
held
and
proceeded
to
trial.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
the
second
thing
which
we
are
trying
to
prevent
or
the
court
is
trying
to
prevent
in
pearce
is
the
vindictive
sentencing.
how
do
we
go
about
handling
it?
first
of
all,
the
court
said
that
the
type
of
material,
the
factors
to
be
considered
by
a
judge
imposing
a
second
sentence
should
be
limited
to
objective
identifiable
conduct
occurring
after
the
first
sentence.
actually
it
didn’t
say
“limited
to
it,”
it
said
“based
upon.”
and,
secondly,
there’s
a
record
making
requirement,
that
is,
this
material
must
be
placed
on
the
record
so
that
a
higher
court
can
review
that
the
bases
for
sufficiency.
now,
retroactivity,
it’s
our
contention,
will
not
further
either
of
these
goals.
first
of
all,
those
who
have
been,
in
the
past,
deterred
from
appealing
are
not
going
to
be--
have
their
wrongs
righted
by
the
retroactivity
of
pearce
to
those
cases
where
those
who
did
appeal
had
their--
had
a
higher
sentence
imposed,
that
is,
the
actual
wrong
that
the
court
is
dealing
with
is
the
reasonable
fear
of
those--
the
deterrence
of
those
who
want
to
appeal
but
are
afraid
to
appeal.
these
are
the
people
who
have
suffered
the
appellate
wrong
that
pearce
was
trying
to
avoid.
now,
making
these
cases
retroactive,
making
this
case
retroactive
to
handle
those--
where
the
defendant
did
appeal
obviously,
those
who
were
afraid
will
never
have
justice
done
to
them.
secondly,
the
prospective
application
of
pearce
will
satisfy
each
of
the--
satisfy
this
appellate
and
of
pearce,
that
is,
from
now
on
we
know,
we
being--
we
convicted
of
crimes,
we
know
that
we
will
not
be
subject
to
a
vindictive
sentence
the
second
time
around
and
we
now
can
prosecute
our
appeals.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
if
that
case--
if
pearce
were
to
be
retroactively
applied,
it
would
have
to
be
logically
a
question
of
each
person
who
was
sentenced
would
then
have
a
right
to
say--
come
in
and
say,
“well,
i
was
deterred
because
of
the
fear
of
reasonable--
unreasonable
increase
in
sentence
and,
therefore,
hear
my
appeal,”
thus,
reopening
or
opening
for
the
first
time
each
sentence
at
least
and
each
conviction
that
has
ever
taken
place,
in
which
the
defendant
presumably
is
still
alive.
thus,
the
proof
problems
would
be
immense
and,
furthermore,
pearce--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i’m
sorry--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
have
no
figures,
your
honor,
except
for
figures
which
were
cited
in
the
appendix
to
walsh
versus
commonwealth
dealing
there,
not
with
the
type
of
review
we
have
here,
the
type
of
sentence
we
have
here,
but
appellate
review
of
sentencing.
this
came
about
in
the--
under
the
massachusetts
rule
and,
in
that,
there
are
many,
many
statistics.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
well,
in
minneap--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
well,
the
flood,
your
honor,
would
come
from
every
single
conviction.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
if
a
person
could
conceivably--
for
example,
a
person
is
convicted,
100
people
are
convicted--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
don’t
know
how
many
there
are.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
there
are
some.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
think
they
would
be,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
because
the
appellate
purpose
of
pearce
is
to
avoid
the
fear
of
a
higher
sentence.
if
a
person
in
jail,
in
prison,
does
not
appeal,
it
may
be
for
a
number
of
reasons.
for
example,
he
might
be
satisfied
with
his
conviction,
satisfied
to
justice
done,
but
one
reason--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that
could
be,
your
honor.
furthermore,
the
sentencing
process
is
to
be
protected
by
pearce
and
there
were--
the
real
bugaboo,
the
real
evil,
is
a
question
of
actual
vindictiveness.
now,
that
is
actual
vindictiveness
for
having
taken
an
appeal,
and
the
way
the
court
handled
that
was
to
formulate
a
rule
of,
basically,
constructive
vindictiveness.
the
court
said
“alright,
if
these
criteria
which
we’re
laying
down
are
not
met
then,
in
effect,
we
are
construing,
we
are
saying
that
this
sentence
is
reversible
because
it
is
not--
it
is
technically,
it
is
based
on
a
vindictive
type
of
sentencing.
it
is
constructive
vindictiveness,
but
we
are
actually
trying
to
avoid
actual
vindictiveness
and
like
actual
police
misconduct,
the
type
of
conduct
we
had
in
mapp
versus
ohio.
we’re
talking
here
about
deterrence
of
that
behavior,
and
retroactive
application
of
pearce
is
not
going
to
enhance
the
deterrent
effect
of
pearce.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
will.
[luncheon
break]
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
questions
that
i
was
requested
to
confine
my
remarks
to,
basically,
what
type
of
behavior
was
indicated
as--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
it
is
but,
primarily,
i’d
like
to
deal
with
the
two
items.
there
is
an
affidavit,
two
affidavits,
in
the
petitioner’s
appendix
found
on
pages
17
through
21.
these
are
from
judge
burns.
one
was
supplied
to
the
request
of
the
michigan
supreme
court,
the
other
he
submitted
to
clarify
one
matter
in
this
court.
basically,
they
could
be
boiled
down
to
two
things.
first
of
all,
the--
he
felt
that
the
behavior
of
mr.
payne
at
the
trial
warranted
an
increase
in
sentence,
namely
after
receiving
a
new
trial,
he
came
in
and
the
judge
concluded
and,
we
believe
the
jury
must
have
concluded,
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
because
of
the
following
reasons.
the
evidence
presented
by
the
people
was
as
follows.
first
of
all,
vick
yost,
the
victim,
made
an
incorrect
identification
of
the
defendant
as
the
one
who
shot
him.
he
had
known
him
before
and
saw
him,
recognized
him
when
the
shots
were
being
fired,
and
testified
that
way
in
court.
furthermore,
when
he
was
laying
on
the
street
and
the
first
officers
came
up
to
the
scene
and
asked
“who
shot
you?”
and
it
was
testified
that
vick
said
“leroy
payne.”
“the
license
number?”
then,
he
gave
the
license
number
of
the
car,
“rb2599.”
that
car,
when
it
drove
away,
had
been
fired
at
by
the
officers,
bullet
hole--
pardon
me,
fired
at
the
returning
vehicle.
they
found
the
car
later,
the
same
license
number,
four
bullet
holes
in
the
trunk
of
the
car,
and
that
car
was
leroy
payne’s.
next,
the
assault
weapon
was
found,
and
leroy
payne’s
fingerprint
was
found
on
it.
against
this,
defendant
testified
to
an
alibi,
namely,
“i
was
at
home
during
the
time--
at
all
time--
i
was
home
in
bed
during
the
time
the
shooting
took
place.
i
did
not
shoot
vick
yost.
i
did
not
drive
my
car
that
night.”
the
jury,
in
finding
the
man
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
must
have
found
that
the
testimony
of
mr.
payne
was
untrue.
that,
in
many
case,
in
insanity
defenses,
and
many
other
types
of
defenses,
this
is
not
the
case,
but
when
there’s
an
alibi
defense
and
especially
in
this
case
where
it
is
so
clearly--
the
positions
of
the
two
parties
are
so
clearly
defined,
the
verdict
of
the
jury
was
that
he
was
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
it
must’ve
included
the
fact
finding
that
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
sir.
that
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
second
point.
taking
this
type
of
behavior
at
the
second
trial
together
with
the
completely
different
approach
that
mr.
payne
took
at
the
first
trial
and
that--
you’ll
notice
in
the
appendix
on
pages
6
through
8,
the
sentencing
transcript
of
judge
hadsol.
he
specifically
notes
the
type--
the
approach
that
this
defendant
had
taken,
confessing
his
crime,
made
him
a
very
appli--
appt
candidate
for
rehabilitation.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
that’s
not
the
case,
your
honor.
my
position
here--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
in--
there’s
a
difference,
your
honor,
we
believe,
between
maintaining
a
person’s
innocence.
that
is
a
legal
conclusion.
as
i
can
say
i’m
innocent,
but
not
come
in
and
testify
to
facts
which
are--
specific
facts
which
are
not
true.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
if
the
case--
i
know,
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
co-defendant,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
because
i’m
dealing
with
a
question
of
the
same
person.
we’re
dealing
with
the
same
person.
at
one
time
in
1963,
having
one
attitude
and
an--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
for
behavior--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
for
behavior
which
he
had
exhibited
after
that
first
sentence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no,
the
purpose
was
not
that
he’d
go
back
and
plead
guilty
again.
it
was
to
have
a
fair
trial,
which
he
received.
in
the
course
of
that
trial,
he
exhibited
conduct
which
we
contend
is
detrimental
conduct,
that
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that
is,
testifying
falsely.
we
believe
that
this
court
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
your
honor,
the--
a
determination--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
we
do.
we
do
not
charge
him
with
perjury
because
of
the--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
case?
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
but,
in
finding
that
they
agree
with
the
state,
they
have
to
completely
disregard
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
well--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
we
should
note--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
sir,
and
all
the
testimony
has
to
do
is
to
lead
to
that
conclusion.
basically,
the
sentence
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
the
difference,
i
believe,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
your
honor--
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
i
believe,
your
honor,
it’s
his
conduct
which
would
indicate
a
certain
something
about
his
character
which
the
judge
could
take
into
consideration
in
imposing
a
higher
sentence,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
he
took
into
consideration
that
the
jury
found
he
was
not
telling
the
truth,
and
this
indicated
something
about
his
character,
a
change
in
his
character
which
had
to
do
with
the
length
of
the
sentence
which
had
been
imposed.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that
is
not
what
we
require
defendants,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
no.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
facts
were
slightly
different
and
that
is
that,
and
this
is
something
that
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
notice
and
that
was
that,
judge
hadsol
had
presided
at
the
trial
of
bradford
before
he
sentenced
payne.
so,
he
heard
payne
testifying.
that’s--
we
don’t
dispute
that.
he
did--
was
available--
was
aware
of
the
facts
of
bradford
and
payne
during
the
payne
trial
or
at
the
payne
sentence.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
he
may
have.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
he
didn’t
specifically
state
that.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
you
don’t,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
correct.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
with
regards
to
the
case
of
the
presentence
report,
in
the
argument
before
judge
burns
and
prior
to
it,
in
the
formal
argument,
the
actual
argument
before
him,
before
the
final
ruling
was
put
in
the
record
and
included
in
the
appendix,
it
was
suggested
to
mr.
benson
by
myself
and
also,
i
believe,
by
the
judge
that
we
would
have
no
objection
and
we
suggested
that
he
come
up
to
this
court
and
say--
request
the
court
to
free
this--
to
bring
this
presentence
report
to
this
court,
and
so
it’s
not
a
question
of
exhausting
all
alternatives
because
that
alternative
was
suggested
to
him.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
this
would
then
put
the
burden
on
this
court.
if
the
court
wanted
the
defendant
to
have
a
copy
of
it,
the
judge
would
have
no
objection--
could
have
no
objection.
mr.
john
a.
smietanka
that’s
the
way
the
ruling
was
made,
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
it
was
that
because
of
judge
burns’
feelings
on
the
matter
of
disclosure
of
presentence
reports
which
eh
included
in
his
ruling,
the
reasons
why
he
feels
they
should
be
confidential
and
to--
namely
to
protect
the
sources
of
the
information
and
not
to
have
these
sources
dry
up
and
to
give
the
judges
as
much
latitude
as
possible
to
consider
information,
both
favorable
and
unfavorable,
to
the
defendant.
with
regards
to
the
time
between
the
original
plea
and
the
original--
pardon
me,
the
original
sentence
and
the
original
appeal,
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
how
long
that
was.the
record
will
indicate
it
was
three
years.
the
case
of
murchison
was
cited
several
times
and
we
feel
that
it’s
not
applicable
at
all.
in
that
case,
we’re
dealing
with
the
determination
by
the
same
judge
and
only
by
that
judge
of
whether
or
not
perjury
had
been
committed.
when
the
first
determination
was
made
or
the
perjured
statement
or
the
alleged
perjured
statement
was
made
in
a
one-man
grand
juror
situation,
there
was
only
one
person
there
to
hear
the
perjury,
and
that
was
the
one-man
grand
juror
himself
and
the
court
required
that
that
type
of
proceeding
required
a
full
hearing
by
another
judge
for
the
contempt
citation
to
stand.
and
furthermore,
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
perjury,
i’m
not
absolutely
sure,
but
i
believe
that
the
law
in
michigan
as
it
stood
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial
or
the
trial
was
not
because
it
was
punishable
by
life
but
rather
by
15
years
and
that
it
was
subsequently
amended
to
make
it
life.
i
believe
there’s
some
question
in
that
area,
but
the--
i
do
not
know
the
citation
of
that.
i
can’t
give
it
to
the
court.
thank
you.
