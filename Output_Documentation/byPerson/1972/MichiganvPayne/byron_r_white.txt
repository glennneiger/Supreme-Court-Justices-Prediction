justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
your--
state’s
position
that
the
state
may
impose
a
heavier
sentence
in
any
case
if
they
plead
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
victim.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
is
there
here?
the
man
maintained
his
innocence
in
the
second
trial
after
having
confessed
to
it?
of
course,
that’s
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you’re
saying
the
heavier
sentence
was
justified
by
his
behavior,
namely
denying
the
crime
and
maintaining
his
innocence.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
say
that,
but
a
man
comes
up
the
stand
and
denies
that
he
shot
the
weapon,
that
he
shot
the
gun
and
then
the
jury
finds
him
guilty,
that
the
state
justified
imposing
a
heavier
sentence
on
him
than
his
co-defendant
who
plead
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
would
say
that,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
loses
then,
he
loses
his
game
when
the
jury
finds
him
innocent.
he--
they’ll
have
to
punish
him
more
heavily
than
if
he
had--
justice
byron
r.
white
than
if
he
had
pleaded
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
has--
he
did
plead
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
at
the
sentencing
he
was
found
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
michigan
needs
to
perform
the
actual
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
year
was
his
first
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
he’s
first
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they’re
still
setting
it?
is
there
still
a
procedure
to
set
aside
guilty
pleas
based
on
allegedly
coerced
confessions?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
appeal--
after
a
guilty
plea,
you
may
appeal
the
admissibility,
say,
of
a
appeal
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
can’t--
you
don’t
have
a
system
in
new
york
where
if
you
make
a
motion
to
suppress
certain
evidence
and
is
denied,
plead
guilty,
and
have
him
appeal
the
suppression
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
you
have
in
your
case
what
happened
was
the
guilty
plea
was
claimed
to
be
an
expressed
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
your
position
be
different
if
he
had,
in
fact,
bradford?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
subs--
absently,
bradford
had
pried.
the
second
judge
very
likely
might
know
more
about
the
defendant.
if
he’s
tried,
then
the
judge
will
just
let
him
plead
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
kind
of
information
that
pearce
had
probably.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
may
be
information
that
the
first
judge
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
at
the--
let’s
assume
that
at
the
sentencing,
after
the
second
trial,
there’s
no--
the
defendant
doesn’t
say
anything
but
“i’m
innocent”
and
maintains
his
innocence.
now,
are
you
suggesting
that,
invariably,
that
it’s
an
invalid
factor
for
a
judge
to
take
into
account
in
sentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
don’t--
let’s
just
say
first
sentence,
second
sentence,
third
sentence,
any
sentencing,
a
judge
may
not
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
defendant
denies
his
guilt
and
shows
no
remorse
whatsoever.
i’m
not
arguing
one
side
or
the
other
of
that.
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
positions
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
that
it’s
unconstitutional
to
take
that
factor
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
if
you’re
wrong
on
that,
you
don’t
have
as
good
a
case
here,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
state’s
position
is
very
close
to
saying
that
pearce
would
never
apply
where
there’s
a--
where,
in
the
first
proceeding,
there’s
a
plea
of
guilty
which
is
said
aside
then
there’s
a
retrial
and
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judge
as
well.
arguably,
in
any
one
of
those
situations,
the
judge--
as
long
as
the
judge
said
i
have
seen
something--
i
have
made
an
assessment
of
the--
reassessment
of
the
defendant’s
character
that
the
first
judge
didn’t
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
your
position
is
that
you
should--
a
defendant’s
conduct
in
the
second
trial,
in
the
courtroom,
should
never
be
sufficient
to
abate
pearce.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn’t
there
a
second
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant
was
there,
wasn’t
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
didn’t
the
defendant--
didn’t
the
judge
say
that--
why
he
took
it
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
his
conduct
in
prison?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
your--
state’s
position
that
the

may
impose
a
