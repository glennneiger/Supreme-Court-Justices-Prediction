justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
first
of
all,
did
the
same
judge
evoke
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i
thought,
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
figure
as
to
how
many
people
convicted,
successful
on
appeal,
who
had
their
sentences
enhanced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
talking
about
ju--
this
big
flood
you’re
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
know
how
big
this
flood
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
every
single
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
a
few
people
in
the
penitentiary
today
were
convicted
and
didn’t
appeal
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
are
some.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
wouldn’t
be
covered.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i’m
already
quarreling
with
your
word
“all,”
and
i
still
say
that
a
man
in
the
penitentiary
who
serves
life
imprisonment
wouldn’t
be
worried
about
enhancement
of
his
sentence.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what’s
the
sense--
this
man
was
pleaded
guilty.
he
was
convicted
and
he
appealed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
the
purpose
of
the
appeal
so
he
could
go
back
and
plead
guilty
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know
it
was
falsely?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
have
perjury
as
an
issue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
can
say
is
the
jury
didn’t
agree
with
him.
is
the
case
any
more
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
jury
agreed
with
the
state
and
did
not
agree
with
the
defendant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
other
convic--
how
else
do
you
get
a
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
plead
one
side,
you
vote
that
way.
if
you
plead
the
other
side,
you
vote
that
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
makes
it
so
different
from
the
(inaudible)
criminal
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it
that’s
so
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
time,
he
says
“i
did
it,
i
shot
it
and
i’m
sorry,”
which
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
do,
and
then
he
gets
a
new
trial
and
he
says
“i
didn’t
shoot
it.”
is
that
horrible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
enough
to
increase
a
sentence
on
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
the
judge
take
in
the
consideration
except
that
he
didn’t
believe
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
change
in
his
character
that
he
wasn’t
now
and
then
a
scraper.
is
that
the
change?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
else
is
there,
other
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
also
take
consideration
of
the
fact
that
he
testified
for
the
state
to
convict
the
other
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
know
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don’t
know
he
took
it
into
consideration
at
all,
do
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
only
took
one
side
into
consideration.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
perjury
in
michigan,
five

justice
thurgood

it
to
you.
justice
thurgood

in
his
affidavit,
he
didn’t
offer

justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

the

way
that
the

can
see
it
is
for
us
to
order.
