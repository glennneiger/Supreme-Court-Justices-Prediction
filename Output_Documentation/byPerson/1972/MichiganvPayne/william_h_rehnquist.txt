justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it,
you’ve
already
explained
at
some
length
what
you
think
is
different,
haven’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
any
contention
that
the
guilty
plea
was
beaten
out
of
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
but
what
i
asked
you
was,
was
there
any
contention
that
the
guilty
plea
itself
was
beaten
out
of
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i’m
not--
i
didn’t
ask
you
over
the
implication.
do
you
contend
that
the
plea
itself
was
beaten
out
of
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
after
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
among
the
reasons
given,
is
it
required
that
he
assert
inst--
innocence
of
the
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
quite
different,
really,
isn’t
it,
if
the
man
simply
pleads
innocent
and
says
to
the
state
“prove
my
case”
or
even
if
he
takes
the
stand
and
testifies
on
issues
that
he
could
be
believed
on
consistently
with
an
overall
verdict
of
guilty
and
compare
it
to
the
getting
on
the
stand
and
saying
that
i
was
in
such
and
such
a
place
and
not
where
the
crime
is
committed.
that
there
are
all
different
ways
in
which
he
could
legally
assert
his
innocence.
justice
william

but,
in
williams,
we
said
the
original
sentence
could
be
imposed.
