mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
hill.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
black
was
still
wasn't
reconciled
with
that,
was
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace,
let
me
interrupt
you
a
moment
to
ask
general
hill.
would
it
be
a
particular
accommodation
to
you
if
you
could
leave
to
get
back
to
georgia
tonight?
if
so,
we
will
go
on
to
finish
today,
but
if
you
are
willing,
we
will
terminate
it
at
three
and
finish
tomorrow
morning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
then
you
may
proceed
until
3
o?clock
which
is
only
a
minute
off.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we?ll
resume
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
arguments,
in
case
we
closed
on
yesterday.
i
believe
mr.
wallace
were
you
at
the
lectern?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
have
a
few
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
specific
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
specific
provision
of
the
act,
in
your
view,
puts
this
burden
on
the
states,
in
terms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i?m
just
thinking
about
the
act.
if
the
act
is
clear
we
don?t
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
or
if
the
act
does
--
is
silent,
perhaps
we
don?t.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
is
this
provision
that
you?re
talking
about
equally
applicable
to
the
attorney
--
procedure
before
the
attorney
general
and
to
the
proceeding
in
the
district
court?
is
the
burden
the
same
way
in
each
instance
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
congress
was
explicit
on
the
burden
with
respect
to
the
district
court
or
certainly
considerably
more
explicit
with
the
ordinary
rule
of
construction
when
it
was
silent
with
respect
to
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
that
do
to
the,
what
was
in
ancient
times
of
general
understanding
that
the
legislative
act
of
a
state
had
a
certain
presumptive
validity?
this
pretty
well
under
cuts
it,
doesn?t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
already
indicated
that,
that
was
true
with
respect
to
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
but
it?s
virtually
standardless
with
respect
to
the
procedure
before
the
attorney
general,
isn?t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
sometimes
this
court
has
taken
a
rather
dim
view
of
the
standardless
discretion
committed
to
administrative
processes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn?t
it
pretty
final
when
the
attorney
general
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
against
the
background
of
the
attorney
general?s
disapproval?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace,
we?ve
taken
up
quite
a
bit
of
your
time
since
you
got
here
this
morning
and
maybe
you
had
something
on
your
mind
when
you
got
here,
so
we
will
give
you
a
little
time
to
tell
us
about
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
hill,
you
have
about
nine
minutes
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
power
under
the
statute,
are
you
saying,
no
power
in
the
district
court
to,
in
effect,
stay
the
negative
action
of
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
mean
is
under
the
act?
