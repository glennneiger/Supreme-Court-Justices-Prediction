mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
in
georgia.
the
appeal
involves
the
possible
applicability
of
section
5
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
to
state
legislative
reapportionment
acts
and
i
think
it
would
also
necessarily
involve
congressional
redistricting
acts.
but,
it
particularly
involves
the
reapportionment
act,
particularly
the
use
by
a
state
of
multimember
districts.
it
also
involves
the
attorney
general's
regulations
for
administering
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
very
briefly
stated,
the
fact
is
that
the
attorney
general
disapproved
two
reapportionment
plans
for
the
georgia
house
of
representatives.
he
objected
to
georgia?s
use
of
multimember
districts,
which
georgia
has
been
using
since
at
least
1880.
when
the
georgia
legislature
met
on
the
last
night
of
its
regular
1972
legislative
session
and
it
was
unable
to
divide
all
of
the
multimember
districts
into
single-member
districts,
they
passed
a
resolution
seeking
to
involve
the
aid
of
the
federal
district
court
and
this
suit
was
filed
by
the
united
states.
there
are
four
questions
presented
by
the
appeal.
the
first
is,
is
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
applicable
to
state
legislative
reapportionment
acts,
and
if
so,
is
section
5
constitutional
as
thus
applied.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
georgia
with
respect
to
this
question,
that
a
reapportionment
act
is
not
a
voting
change
within
the
meaning
of
section
5,
such
that
it
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
justice
department
for
approval.
if
we
are
in
error
in
this
contention,
then
it
is
our
contention
that
section
5,
as
applied
to
reapportionment,
is
unconstitutional
in
that
it
is
not
appropriate
legislation
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
course,
being
the
source
of
authority
for
the
passage
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act
and
the
question
determined
in
the
katzenbach
versus
south
carolina
having
said
that
the
voting
rights
act
was
appropriate
legislation
in
the
context
of
that
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
second
question
raised,
is
does
the
prior
submission
requirement
of
section
5
limit
the
attorney
general
to
disapproving
the
change
in
state
law
or
can
he,
under
section
5,
disapprove
things
which
have
not
changed
such
as
georgia?s
use
of
multimember
districts?
the
third
question
is,
does
section
5
empower
the
attorney
general
to
disapprove
a
state
law
which
he
does
not
find
it
to
be
discriminatory,
but
above
which
he
is
unable
to
reach
a
decision?
there
are
other
questions
subsidiary
to
this
third
question
such
as
does
the
attorney
general
have
the
authority
to
promulgate
regulations,
any
regulations,
particularly
regulations
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
submitting
state
thereby,
establishing
his
civil
rights
division
as
a
court
without
providing
the
submitting
state
with
notice
of
any
charges
and
opportunity
to
examine
the
material
on
which
his
decision
is
to
be
based.
the
final
question
is,
does
the
attorney
general
have
the
power
to
extend
the
60-day
time
limit
congress
placed
upon
him
in
section
5
of
the
act?
does
he
have
the
power
to
adapt
regulations
and
if
he
does
have
that
power,
which
we
submit
he
does
not,
does
that
power
include
the
power
to
amend
a
law
of
congress?
the
lower
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
government
on
all
of
these
issues.
georgia
began
using
multimember
districts
in
its
house
of
representatives
in
1880.
in
1917,
it
adapted
the
majority
vote
requirement
as
to
certain
offices.
that
is
the
requirement
of
the
candidate
in
order
to
be
nominated
in
a
primary
or
elected
in
the
election
must
receive
a
majority
of
the
vote
as
opposed
some
states
used
plurality.
as
a
consequence,
georgia
has
a
runoff
in
case
nobody
gets
a
majority
in
the
first
election,
there
is
a
second
election,
a
runoff
election
in
which
the
two
top
candidates
compete
against
each
other,
so
that
one
of
them
ends
up
with
the
majority
in
most
cases.
in
1953,
georgia
adapted
the
designated
post
requirement.
that
is
to
say
that
if
you
are
a
candidate
for
a
multimember
district,
you
must
designate
one
of
those
multimember
seats
that
you
want.
in
1962,
the
majority
vote
requirement
was
made
applicable
to
legislators
in
primaries.
it
has
not
theretofore
been
applicable
to
house
representative
members.
in
1964,
june
24,
1964,
the
majority
requirement
was
made
applicable
to
legislators
in
elections
as
well
as
primaries.
so,
that
as
of
june
24,
1964,
georgia
was
using
multimember
districts
designated
posts
and
majority
runoff
requirement
as
a
house
of
representative
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
assuming
you
had
to
say
a
three-men
multimember
district
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
you
would,
on
today?
situation,
you
would
designate
that
you
want
either
post
1
or
post
2
or
post
3.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
and
you
are
running
against
the
people
who
have
designated
post
1
if
that
is
your
selection.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
not
against
the
people
who
have
designate
the
other
post.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
we
would.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that?s
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
you
designate
it.
now,
i
might
say
that
prior
to
1965
actually,
we
didn?t
use
numbers.
you
designated
the
name
of
the
man
holding
that
seat
that
you
wanted,
but
as
a
result
of
the
reapportionment
of
1965
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that?s
correct.
it
was
designated
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
if
he
was
running,
you
got
his
name
on
there
twice?
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
he
was
running
for
his
own
seat.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
but,
at
that
time,
we
only
had
--
the
most
we
had
was
a
three-men
multimember
district
and
as
a
result
of
the
reapportionment
of
the
1965,
one
district
went
to
64,
excuse
me,
to
24
members,
a
24
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
member
district.
and
it
was
necessary
to
discontinue
the
use
of
names
because
there
were
21
seats
that
had
no
names
then
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
and
used
numbers.
so,
we
did
change
our
designated
post
situation
in
1965
from
designating
by
naming
the
incumbent
to
designating
by
numbers.
but
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
government,
that
change
is
not,
the
change
that?s
in
issue
here.
the
reason
i
emphasize
that
june
24,
1964,
we
have
multimember
districts,
numbered
posts,
and
designated
post
requirement
is
that
that
was
prior
to
the
introduction
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act
in
march
of
1965.
it
was
also
prior
to
the
retroactive
effective
date
of
the
voting
rights
act,
november
1,
1964.
this
court
decided
with
whitcomb
versus
chavez
in
june
of
1971.
thereafter,
the
1970
census
for
georgia
became
available.
the
governor
called
the
legislature
into
special
session,
in
the
latter
part
of
september
and
in
the
early
october
and
georgia
adapted
a
reapportionment
plan
for
its
house
of
representatives,
as
well
as
for
its
senate
and
as
well
as
for
congress.
those
two
plans
are
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
house
reapportionment
plan
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
on
november
5,
1971
along
with
a
mass
of
information.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
record
to
show
the
letter
which
requested
seven
categories
of
information.
on
november
19th,
the
attorney
general
requested
these
seven
additional
categories
of
information
which
required
them
until
january
6,
1972
to
compile
and
to
submit.
the
attorney
general
on
march
3,
1972,
a
friday,
objected
to
the
1971
reapportionment
plan.
now,
that
objection
was
within
60
days
of
january
6th
when
the
additional
information
had
been
submitted,
but
it
was
approximately
120
days
from
the
date
of
the
november
5th
submission
of
the
1971
reapportionment
act.
the
general
assembly
received
that
letter
of
objection
on
monday,
march
6th
at
which
time
it
had
four
days
remaining
in
its
regular
1972
session.
during
those
four
days,
it
subdivided
into
single-member
districts,
i
believe
18
multimember
districts,
leaving
it
with
32
multimember
districts.
it
adapted
the
resolution
seeking
to
invoke
the
aid
of
the
federal
district
court
and
adjourned.
that
second
plan
in
the
1972
reapportionment
plan
was
disapproved
on
the
ground
that
it
continued
the
use
of
multimember
districts,
numbered
posts
and
majority
runoff
requirement.
that
had
been
the
ground
basically
of
the
objection
to
the
first
plan,
georgia?s
combination
use
of
multimember
districts,
numbered
posts,
and
majority
runoff
requirement.
the
suit
was
filed.
there
was
a
hearing
on
april
18th,
at
which
time
the
government
said,
?our
only
objection
at
this
time
is
as
to
15
multimember
districts,
not
32.?
as
we
see
it,
the
government
abandoned
its
objection
to
numbered
posts,
abandoned
its
objection
to
the
majority
runoff
requirement
and
said,
?our
real
objection
is
to
multimember
districts
and
we
only
object
to
15
of
those,
not
to
all
32.?
as
to
10
of
the
multimember
districts
which
it
had
previously
had
objected
to,
the
government
said
?that
the
number
of
minority
members
living
in
those
districts
is
so
small
as
to
not
be
cognizable.?
as
to
6
of
those
districts
which
had
abandoned
its
objection
to,
the
government
said
?that
the
non-white
population
is
so
dispersed
throughout
these
areas,
that
the
fact
that
they
are
multimember
district
has
no
impact.
you
could
not
cut
it
into
a
single-member
district
and
significantly
affect
their
voting
impact.?
the
government
also
withdrew
its
objection
to
the
fulton
county
multimember
district
which
is
at
single-member
districts
throughout
fulton
county
with
three
at
large
above
it.
and
they
had
objected
to
those
three
and
then
they
removed
or
eliminated
their
objection
to
that
because
the
difficulty
of
forcing
those
three
districts
down
into
21,
i
believe,
is
quite
considerable
and
would
have
had
no
great
racial
impact.
now
--
but
then
again
said,
?but,
we
think
all
of
these
17
districts
that
we?ve,
as
i
see
it,
we
are
now
conceding
that
we
shouldn?t
have
objected
to
on
section
5
grounds.
we
think
they?re
all
ought
to
be
subdivided
on
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
because
of
equal
protection
problems.?
and
the
court
said,
?but,
it
would
be
mighty
risky
to
have
a
special
session
and
not
subdivide
all
of
these
multimember
districts.?
its
decision
came
out
on
april
19th
the
following
day,
did
not
deal
with
the
government's
suggestion
that
all
multimember
districts
be
subdivided.
and
the
general
assembly
was
faced
with
the
special
session
for
reapportionment
not
knowing
whether
to
subdivide
15
districts
or
32
districts.
we
applied
for
a
stay
which
this
court
granted
on
april
21,
1972.
section
4
of
the
voting
rights
act,
contains
the
formula
for
determining
which
states
and
political
subdivisions
are
subject
to
the
act.
pursuant
to
the
section
4
formula,
there
are
six
states
covered
by
the
act,
alabama,
georgia,
louisiana,
mississippi,
south
carolina
and
virginia
and
there
are
six
states
which
have
political
subdivisions
subject
to
the
act.
arizona
has
8
of
12
counties,
has
one-third
of
its
population
covered
by
the
act.
california
has
two
counties.
hawaii
has
80%
of
its
people
covered
by
the
act,
one
county,
but
it
happens
to
be,
i
believe,
honolulu
county.
idaho
has
one
county.
north
carolina
has
39
of
100
counties.
wyoming
has
one
county.
new
york
had
three
counties.
i
believe
the
court
is
going
to
have
a
case
involving
that
situation
here
shortly.
alaska
has
i
believe,
petitioned
and
been
removed
from
the
voting
rights
act.
but,
of
these
states
affected
by
the
act,
only
north
carolina
and
new
york
have
ever
submitted,
these
are
the
affected
states,
not
the
covered
states,
only
these,
only
new
york
and
north
carolina
have
ever
submitted
their
reapportionment
plans
to
the
attorney
general.
arizona,
california,
hawaii,
idaho,
and
wyoming
apparently
do
not
know
that
the
justice
department
is
just
waiting
for
them
to
submit
their
reapportionment
plans
before
those
reapportionment
plans
can
go
into
effect.
basically,
our
argument
on
non-applicability
is
this.
there
are
voting
laws
relating
to
voters.
there
are
relating
to
candidates.
there
are
laws
relating
to
the
composition
and
organization
of
state
government.
reapportionment
is
a
law
relating
to
the
composition
of
a
legislative
body.
reapportionment
is
not
a
voting
law
required
to
be
submitted
to
washington
within
the
meaning
of
the
voting
rights
act
we
submit.
that
is,
we
think
what
the
government
had
in
mind
when
it
filed
its
brief
in
fairley
a
companion
to
allen
versus
the
state
board
of
elections.
in
the
government?s
brief
in
fairley,
it
in
effect
said
to
this
court
that
you?re
holding
section
5
applicable
in
fairley
would
not
be
tantamount
to
concluding
that
section
5
applied
to
reapportionment
and
redistricting.
now
you
may
inquire,
held
in
georgia
argued
that
section
5
is
not
applicable
to
reapportionment
when
she
submitted
her
reapportionment
laws
to
the
attorney
general.
i
think
the
question
relates
only
to
applicability
not
to
constitutionality
because
i
think,
we
are
entitled
to
take
the
position
that
the
law
is
not
constitutional
as
applied.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
was
just
such
a
case
in
which
the
government
said
you
are
holding
the
section
5
applicable
in
this
case
will
not
be
tantamount
to
holding
section
5
applicable
in
reapportionment.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well,
i
have
this
--
i?ll
adapt
whatever
position
the
government
had
in
that
case
i
might
say
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
but,
the
court
in
allen
said,
we
do
not
here
reach
the
question
of
whether
section
5
is
applicable
to
reapportionment.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
cannot.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
this
instance,
it?s
a
reapportionment
case
and
i
do
not
see
--
let
me
think
further
on
that
and
answer
it
this
way.
to
me,
there
are
voting
laws
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
let
me
undertake
to
retract
my
quick
concession
if
i
may.
there
are
voting
laws
and
there
are
election
laws.
now,
to
me,
katzenbach
dealt
with
voting
laws.
allen
and
perkins
dealt
with
election
laws.
now,
if
reapportionment
is
not
even
an
election
law
then
it's
not
covered
by
allen
and
perkins
because
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
it?s
an
apportionment.
it
is
a
law
relating
to
the
operation
of
government
or
the
structure
of
government.
for
example,
i
would
not
think
that
whether
or
not
you
have
a
bicameral
legislature
is
an
election
law.
although,
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
related
to
a
municipality
and
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
then
i?m
at
a
loss
to
understand,
why
the
court
restricted
itself
from
getting
into
the
reapportionment
of
fairley
and
allen.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
proceed
by
saying
that
the
people
who
made
the
decision
to
submit
georgia?s
reapportionment
plan
are
not
obstructionists.
they
know
that
to
make
government
work,
you
need
to
cooperate
whenever
you
can
and
litigate
only
when
necessary.
and
they
did
not
know
when
they
submitted
the
1971
plan
that
the
attorney
general
would
disapprove
the
use
of
multimember
districts
and
make
this
litigation
necessary.
now,
if
section
5
is
applicable
to
reapportionment,
if
it
is
an
election
law,
if
it
is
covered
by
allen
and
perkins,
then
we
contend
that
as
applied
section
5
is
not
appropriate
legislation
authorized
by
the
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
for
these
two
reasons,
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
reapportionment
and
the
section
4
coverage
formula
of
registration
test,
plus
lower
voter
participation
in
a
presidential
election.
the
problem
of
alleged
to
racial
gerrymandery
exists
in
states
not
subject
to
the
act.
texas,
new
york,
indiana
and
delaware
have
had
alleged
gerrymandering
problems
and
those
states
are
not
subject
to
the
act.
so,
that
the
act
simply
offers
no
rational
relationship
to
covering
reapportionment
laws.
with
respect
to
the
second
question,
let
me
make
it
clear
that
i
am
not
arguing
now
at
this
point
that
georgia?s
reapportionment
plan
was
not
a
change,
that
was
the
first
question.
i
am
contending
now
that
what
the
attorney
general
disapproved
was
not
a
change.
let
me,
to
illustrate
what
i?m
trying
to
get
across,
say
that
georgia
has
an
election
code,
a
comprehensive
body
of
law
on
elections.
if
we
change
10
code
sections
and
send
them
to
washington,
we
think
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
entitled
to
disapprove
other
sections
in
georgia?s
election
code.
but
here,
the
attorney
general
disapproved
georgia?s
use
of
multimember
districts
in
combination
with
the
majority
run-off
requirement
and
numbered
posts,
and
georgia
had
not
changed
that.
if
we
change
the
system,
the
attorney
general
could
object
to
our
change
in
the
system,
but
if
we
change
the
lines
and
the
reapportion,
we
don?t
think
that
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
object
to
the
system.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
voting
law
affects
the
voting.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
voting
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
voting
right
act.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
of
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
right.
but
this
has
effect
on
the
voter.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
excuse
me.
i?m
talking
about
changing
the
location
of
a
polling
place.
this
affects
the
voter.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i?m
sorry.
i
don?t
believe
that
we
necessarily
change
the
location
of
polling
places.
the
polling
places
stay
the
same.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no
but
in
georgia,
we
do
not
have
to
go
another
place.
we
go
to
the
same
polling
place
and
vote
for
different
numbered
seats
in
the
legislature.
but
the
effect
on
the
voter
is
not
in
whether
he
goes
to
the
same
poll
to
vote
or
not.
our
argument
is
to
the
third
question
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
without
statutory
authority
adopted
regulations
imposing
a
burden
of
proof
standard
on
the
state
to
satisfy
him
and
we
believe
that
this
is
contrary
to
what
this
court
had
in
mind
in
allen
when
it
said
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
act
as
a
court
in
approving
or
disapproving
the
state
legislation.
we
believe
that
these
procedures
are
contrary
to
morgan
versus
the
united
states
in
304
u.s.
and
the
cases
which
followed
it
through
hannah
v.
larche
in
363
u.s.
and
the
final
question
raises
the
issue
as
to
whether
attorney
general
can
promulgate
regulations
in
any
of
them
at
all,
but
particularly
regulations
changing
the
60-day
time
limit
which
congress
placed
on
him.
the
government's
brief
cites
no
authority
for
him
being
able
to
adapt
regulations.
they
cite
is
a
need
for
additional
information
and
we
submit
the
basis
--
the
arguments
based
on
needs
should
be
addressed
to
the
congress.
the
attorney
general,
the
united
states
above
all
owes
the
submitting
stage
obedience
to
the
time
limits
fixed
by
congress.
in
conclusion,
if
i
may
take
a
hint
from
the
gentleman
who
opened
the
city
of
burbank
case
yesterday,
in
his
opening
argument
he
referred
to
the
declaration
of
independence
and
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
grievances
against
the
king
laws
that
he
has
forbidden
his
governors
to
pass
laws
of
immediate
and
pressing
importance
unless
suspended
in
their
operation
till
his
assent
should
be
obtained.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
somewhat
at
a
loss
for
words
to
learn
that
the
united
states
takes
a
position
that
they
can
sue
the
state
of
georgia
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
one
of
our
defenses
can
only
be
raised
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
i
would
have
thought
that
when
they
sued
us,
we
would
be
entitled
to
all
available
defenses
and
would
not
be
required
to
raise
any
of
those
defenses
in
a
forum
other
than
the
one
that
the
united
states
had
chosen.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
allen
dealt
with
a
situation
where
a
citizen
is
suing
for
a
declaration
or
a
determination
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
there
has
been
a
submission
here,
may
it
please
the
court
and
the
question
is
the
validity
of
the
objection
or
when
it
was
turned
down.
those
factors
were
not
present
in
allen
and
in
perkins,
because
there
had
been
no
submission,
no
objection
by
the
attorney
general.
in
the
reapportionment
context
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
to
raise
the
defense
that
the
objection
was
invalid,
that
the
attorney
general
objected
to
things
which
had
not
changed.
in
a
reapportionment
context,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
really
a
viable
alternative
for
this
reason.
as
i
understand
it,
the
united
states
would
have
60
days
in
which
to
answer
the
complaint
or
a
complaint
for
declaratory
judgment
filed
in
the
dc
district
court
and
then
it
might
take
a
considerable
period
of
time
for
the
district
court
to
make
a
determination
and
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
would
not
be
able
to
formulate
a
plan,
would
not
be
able
to
permit
the
holding
of
elections
in
the
meantime
and
therefore
is
just
not
the
good
way
for
a
state
to
go
to
submit
its
reapportionment
plans
for
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
because
of
the
time
involved
and
the
lack
of
remedial
power
that
that
court
would
have.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
would,
perhaps
a
suit
not
under
the
act,
but
a
suit
for
injunction
or
something
of
that
type
by
the
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
but
if
it
was
under
the
act,
i
think
that
the
only
issue
before
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
would
be
whether
or
not
the
change
had
the
purpose
or
effect
of
racial
voting
discrimination.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
1972
plan
repealed
the
1971
plan
and
that
now
the
question
of
timeliness
is
moot,
but
the
1972
plan
was
disapproved.
it
is
not
in
effect,
the
repealer
clause
contained
in
the
1972
plan
is
not
in
effect.
so,
if
the
1972
plan
is
not
in
effect,
the
1971
plan
is,
and
we
think
that
the
case
is
not
moot
or
the
question
is
not
moot.
now,
i?d
like
to
refer
to
just
one
other
matter
and
that
is
the
allen
decision.
the
court
is
of
course
familiar
with
the
several
lines
in
allen
dealing
with
reapportionment.
i
would
like
to
complete
the
last
portion
of
the
senate?s
read
to
the
court
yesterday.
the
court
there
said,
?we
leave
to
another
case
a
consideration
of
any
possible
conflict,
therefore
i
submit?
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
on
allen,
it?s
at
page
569.
i
submit
that
if
congress
did
adopt
allen
when
it
was
considering
the
1972
amendments,
that
congress
did
not
adopt
anything
that
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
and
that
they
clearly,
the
court
left
some
matters
at
least
with
respect
to
reapportionment
undecided
in
allen
and
that
congress
has
not
adopted
those
undecided
maps.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
in
georgia.
the
appeal
involves
the
possible
applicability
of
section
5
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
to
state
legislative
reapportionment
acts
and
i
think
it
would
also
necessarily
involve
congressional
redistricting
acts.
but,
it
particularly
involves
the
reapportionment
act,
particularly
the
use
by
a
state
of
multimember
districts.
it
also
involves
the
attorney
general's
regulations
for
administering
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
very
briefly
stated,
the
fact
is
that
the
attorney
general
disapproved
two
reapportionment
plans
for
the
georgia
house
of
representatives.
he
objected
to
georgia?s
use
of
multimember
districts,
which
georgia
has
been
using
since
at
least
1880.
when
the
georgia
legislature
met
on
the
last
night
of
its
regular
1972
legislative
session
and
it
was
unable
to
divide
all
of
the
multimember
districts
into
single-member
districts,
they
passed
a
resolution
seeking
to
involve
the
aid
of
the
federal
district
court
and
this
suit
was
filed
by
the
united
states.
there
are
four
questions
presented
by
the
appeal.
the
first
is,
is
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
applicable
to
state
legislative
reapportionment
acts,
and
if
so,
is
section
5
constitutional
as
thus
applied.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
georgia
with
respect
to
this
question,
that
a
reapportionment
act
is
not
a
voting
change
within
the
meaning
of
section
5,
such
that
it
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
justice
department
for
approval.
if
we
are
in
error
in
this
contention,
then
it
is
our
contention
that
section
5,
as
applied
to
reapportionment,
is
unconstitutional
in
that
it
is
not
appropriate
legislation
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
course,
being
the
source
of
authority
for
the
passage
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act
and
the
question
determined
in
the
katzenbach
versus
south
carolina
having
said
that
the
voting
rights
act
was
appropriate
legislation
in
the
context
of
that
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
second
question
raised,
is
does
the
prior
submission
requirement
of
section
5
limit
the
attorney
general
to
disapproving
the
change
in
state
law
or
can
he,
under
section
5,
disapprove
things
which
have
not
changed
such
as
georgia?s
use
of
multimember
districts?
the
third
question
is,
does
section
5
empower
the
attorney
general
to
disapprove
a
state
law
which
he
does
not
find
it
to
be
discriminatory,
but
above
which
he
is
unable
to
reach
a
decision?
there
are
other
questions
subsidiary
to
this
third
question
such
as
does
the
attorney
general
have
the
authority
to
promulgate
regulations,
any
regulations,
particularly
regulations
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
submitting
state
thereby,
establishing
his
civil
rights
division
as
a
court
without
providing
the
submitting
state
with
notice
of
any
charges
and
opportunity
to
examine
the
material
on
which
his
decision
is
to
be
based.
the
final
question
is,
does
the
attorney
general
have
the
power
to
extend
the
60-day
time
limit
congress
placed
upon
him
in
section
5
of
the
act?
does
he
have
the
power
to
adapt
regulations
and
if
he
does
have
that
power,
which
we
submit
he
does
not,
does
that
power
include
the
power
to
amend
a
law
of
congress?
the
lower
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
government
on
all
of
these
issues.
georgia
began
using
multimember
districts
in
its
house
of
representatives
in
1880.
in
1917,
it
adapted
the
majority
vote
requirement
as
to
certain
offices.
that
is
the
requirement
of
the
candidate
in
order
to
be
nominated
in
a
primary
or
elected
in
the
election
must
receive
a
majority
of
the
vote
as
opposed
some
states
used
plurality.
as
a
consequence,
georgia
has
a
runoff
in
case
nobody
gets
a
majority
in
the
first
election,
there
is
a
second
election,
a
runoff
election
in
which
the
two
top
candidates
compete
against
each
other,
so
that
one
of
them
ends
up
with
the
majority
in
most
cases.
in
1953,
georgia
adapted
the
designated
post
requirement.
that
is
to
say
that
if
you
are
a
candidate
for
a
multimember
district,
you
must
designate
one
of
those
multimember
seats
that
you
want.
in
1962,
the
majority
vote
requirement
was
made
applicable
to
legislators
in
primaries.
it
has
not
theretofore
been
applicable
to
house
representative
members.
in
1964,
june
24,
1964,
the
majority
requirement
was
made
applicable
to
legislators
in
elections
as
well
as
primaries.
so,
that
as
of
june
24,
1964,
georgia
was
using
multimember
districts
designated
posts
and
majority
runoff
requirement
as
a
house
of
representative
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
assuming
you
had
to
say
a
three-men
multimember
district
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
you
would,
on
today?
situation,
you
would
designate
that
you
want
either
post
1
or
post
2
or
post
3.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
and
you
are
running
against
the
people
who
have
designated
post
1
if
that
is
your
selection.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
not
against
the
people
who
have
designate
the
other
post.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
we
would.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that?s
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
you
designate
it.
now,
i
might
say
that
prior
to
1965
actually,
we
didn?t
use
numbers.
you
designated
the
name
of
the
man
holding
that
seat
that
you
wanted,
but
as
a
result
of
the
reapportionment
of
1965
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that?s
correct.
it
was
designated
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
if
he
was
running,
you
got
his
name
on
there
twice?
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
he
was
running
for
his
own
seat.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
but,
at
that
time,
we
only
had
--
the
most
we
had
was
a
three-men
multimember
district
and
as
a
result
of
the
reapportionment
of
the
1965,
one
district
went
to
64,
excuse
me,
to
24
members,
a
24
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
member
district.
and
it
was
necessary
to
discontinue
the
use
of
names
because
there
were
21
seats
that
had
no
names
then
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
and
used
numbers.
so,
we
did
change
our
designated
post
situation
in
1965
from
designating
by
naming
the
incumbent
to
designating
by
numbers.
but
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
government,
that
change
is
not,
the
change
that?s
in
issue
here.
the
reason
i
emphasize
that
june
24,
1964,
we
have
multimember
districts,
numbered
posts,
and
designated
post
requirement
is
that
that
was
prior
to
the
introduction
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act
in
march
of
1965.
it
was
also
prior
to
the
retroactive
effective
date
of
the
voting
rights
act,
november
1,
1964.
this
court
decided
with
whitcomb
versus
chavez
in
june
of
1971.
thereafter,
the
1970
census
for
georgia
became
available.
the
governor
called
the
legislature
into
special
session,
in
the
latter
part
of
september
and
in
the
early
october
and
georgia
adapted
a
reapportionment
plan
for
its
house
of
representatives,
as
well
as
for
its
senate
and
as
well
as
for
congress.
those
two
plans
are
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
house
reapportionment
plan
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
on
november
5,
1971
along
with
a
mass
of
information.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
record
to
show
the
letter
which
requested
seven
categories
of
information.
on
november
19th,
the
attorney
general
requested
these
seven
additional
categories
of
information
which
required
them
until
january
6,
1972
to
compile
and
to
submit.
the
attorney
general
on
march
3,
1972,
a
friday,
objected
to
the
1971
reapportionment
plan.
now,
that
objection
was
within
60
days
of
january
6th
when
the
additional
information
had
been
submitted,
but
it
was
approximately
120
days
from
the
date
of
the
november
5th
submission
of
the
1971
reapportionment
act.
the
general
assembly
received
that
letter
of
objection
on
monday,
march
6th
at
which
time
it
had
four
days
remaining
in
its
regular
1972
session.
during
those
four
days,
it
subdivided
into
single-member
districts,
i
believe
18
multimember
districts,
leaving
it
with
32
multimember
districts.
it
adapted
the
resolution
seeking
to
invoke
the
aid
of
the
federal
district
court
and
adjourned.
that
second
plan
in
the
1972
reapportionment
plan
was
disapproved
on
the
ground
that
it
continued
the
use
of
multimember
districts,
numbered
posts
and
majority
runoff
requirement.
that
had
been
the
ground
basically
of
the
objection
to
the
first
plan,
georgia?s
combination
use
of
multimember
districts,
numbered
posts,
and
majority
runoff
requirement.
the
suit
was
filed.
there
was
a
hearing
on
april
18th,
at
which
time
the
government
said,
?our
only
objection
at
this
time
is
as
to
15
multimember
districts,
not
32.?
as
we
see
it,
the
government
abandoned
its
objection
to
numbered
posts,
abandoned
its
objection
to
the
majority
runoff
requirement
and
said,
?our
real
objection
is
to
multimember
districts
and
we
only
object
to
15
of
those,
not
to
all
32.?
as
to
10
of
the
multimember
districts
which
it
had
previously
had
objected
to,
the
government
said
?that
the
number
of
minority
members
living
in
those
districts
is
so
small
as
to
not
be
cognizable.?
as
to
6
of
those
districts
which
had
abandoned
its
objection
to,
the
government
said
?that
the
non-white
population
is
so
dispersed
throughout
these
areas,
that
the
fact
that
they
are
multimember
district
has
no
impact.
you
could
not
cut
it
into
a
single-member
district
and
significantly
affect
their
voting
impact.?
the
government
also
withdrew
its
objection
to
the
fulton
county
multimember
district
which
is
at
single-member
districts
throughout
fulton
county
with
three
at
large
above
it.
and
they
had
objected
to
those
three
and
then
they
removed
or
eliminated
their
objection
to
that
because
the
difficulty
of
forcing
those
three
districts
down
into
21,
i
believe,
is
quite
considerable
and
would
have
had
no
great
racial
impact.
now
--
but
then
again
said,
?but,
we
think
all
of
these
17
districts
that
we?ve,
as
i
see
it,
we
are
now
conceding
that
we
shouldn?t
have
objected
to
on
section
5
grounds.
we
think
they?re
all
ought
to
be
subdivided
on
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
because
of
equal
protection
problems.?
and
the
court
said,
?but,
it
would
be
mighty
risky
to
have
a
special
session
and
not
subdivide
all
of
these
multimember
districts.?
its
decision
came
out
on
april
19th
the
following
day,
did
not
deal
with
the
government's
suggestion
that
all
multimember
districts
be
subdivided.
and
the
general
assembly
was
faced
with
the
special
session
for
reapportionment
not
knowing
whether
to
subdivide
15
districts
or
32
districts.
we
applied
for
a
stay
which
this
court
granted
on
april
21,
1972.
section
4
of
the
voting
rights
act,
contains
the
formula
for
determining
which
states
and
political
subdivisions
are
subject
to
the
act.
pursuant
to
the
section
4
formula,
there
are
six
states
covered
by
the
act,
alabama,
georgia,
louisiana,
mississippi,
south
carolina
and
virginia
and
there
are
six
states
which
have
political
subdivisions
subject
to
the
act.
arizona
has
8
of
12
counties,
has
one-third
of
its
population
covered
by
the
act.
california
has
two
counties.
hawaii
has
80%
of
its
people
covered
by
the
act,
one
county,
but
it
happens
to
be,
i
believe,
honolulu
county.
idaho
has
one
county.
north
carolina
has
39
of
100
counties.
wyoming
has
one
county.
new
york
had
three
counties.
i
believe
the
court
is
going
to
have
a
case
involving
that
situation
here
shortly.
alaska
has
i
believe,
petitioned
and
been
removed
from
the
voting
rights
act.
but,
of
these
states
affected
by
the
act,
only
north
carolina
and
new
york
have
ever
submitted,
these
are
the
affected
states,
not
the
covered
states,
only
these,
only
new
york
and
north
carolina
have
ever
submitted
their
reapportionment
plans
to
the
attorney
general.
arizona,
california,
hawaii,
idaho,
and
wyoming
apparently
do
not
know
that
the
justice
department
is
just
waiting
for
them
to
submit
their
reapportionment
plans
before
those
reapportionment
plans
can
go
into
effect.
basically,
our
argument
on
non-applicability
is
this.
there
are
voting
laws
relating
to
voters.
there
are
relating
to
candidates.
there
are
laws
relating
to
the
composition
and
organization
of
state
government.
reapportionment
is
a
law
relating
to
the
composition
of
a
legislative
body.
reapportionment
is
not
a
voting
law
required
to
be
submitted
to
washington
within
the
meaning
of
the
voting
rights
act
we
submit.
that
is,
we
think
what
the
government
had
in
mind
when
it
filed
its
brief
in
fairley
a
companion
to
allen
versus
the
state
board
of
elections.
in
the
government?s
brief
in
fairley,
it
in
effect
said
to
this
court
that
you?re
holding
section
5
applicable
in
fairley
would
not
be
tantamount
to
concluding
that
section
5
applied
to
reapportionment
and
redistricting.
now
you
may
inquire,
held
in
georgia
argued
that
section
5
is
not
applicable
to
reapportionment
when
she
submitted
her
reapportionment
laws
to
the
attorney
general.
i
think
the
question
relates
only
to
applicability
not
to
constitutionality
because
i
think,
we
are
entitled
to
take
the
position
that
the
law
is
not
constitutional
as
applied.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
was
just
such
a
case
in
which
the
government
said
you
are
holding
the
section
5
applicable
in
this
case
will
not
be
tantamount
to
holding
section
5
applicable
in
reapportionment.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well,
i
have
this
--
i?ll
adapt
whatever
position
the
government
had
in
that
case
i
might
say
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
but,
the
court
in
allen
said,
we
do
not
here
reach
the
question
of
whether
section
5
is
applicable
to
reapportionment.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
cannot.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
this
instance,
it?s
a
reapportionment
case
and
i
do
not
see
--
let
me
think
further
on
that
and
answer
it
this
way.
to
me,
there
are
voting
laws
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
let
me
undertake
to
retract
my
quick
concession
if
i
may.
there
are
voting
laws
and
there
are
election
laws.
now,
to
me,
katzenbach
dealt
with
voting
laws.
allen
and
perkins
dealt
with
election
laws.
now,
if
reapportionment
is
not
even
an
election
law
then
it's
not
covered
by
allen
and
perkins
because
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
it?s
an
apportionment.
it
is
a
law
relating
to
the
operation
of
government
or
the
structure
of
government.
for
example,
i
would
not
think
that
whether
or
not
you
have
a
bicameral
legislature
is
an
election
law.
although,
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
related
to
a
municipality
and
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
then
i?m
at
a
loss
to
understand,
why
the
court
restricted
itself
from
getting
into
the
reapportionment
of
fairley
and
allen.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
proceed
by
saying
that
the
people
who
made
the
decision
to
submit
georgia?s
reapportionment
plan
are
not
obstructionists.
they
know
that
to
make
government
work,
you
need
to
cooperate
whenever
you
can
and
litigate
only
when
necessary.
and
they
did
not
know
when
they
submitted
the
1971
plan
that
the
attorney
general
would
disapprove
the
use
of
multimember
districts
and
make
this
litigation
necessary.
now,
if
section
5
is
applicable
to
reapportionment,
if
it
is
an
election
law,
if
it
is
covered
by
allen
and
perkins,
then
we
contend
that
as
applied
section
5
is
not
appropriate
legislation
authorized
by
the
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
for
these
two
reasons,
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
reapportionment
and
the
section
4
coverage
formula
of
registration
test,
plus
lower
voter
participation
in
a
presidential
election.
the
problem
of
alleged
to
racial
gerrymandery
exists
in
states
not
subject
to
the
act.
texas,
new
york,
indiana
and
delaware
have
had
alleged
gerrymandering
problems
and
those
states
are
not
subject
to
the
act.
so,
that
the
act
simply
offers
no
rational
relationship
to
covering
reapportionment
laws.
with
respect
to
the
second
question,
let
me
make
it
clear
that
i
am
not
arguing
now
at
this
point
that
georgia?s
reapportionment
plan
was
not
a
change,
that
was
the
first
question.
i
am
contending
now
that
what
the
attorney
general
disapproved
was
not
a
change.
let
me,
to
illustrate
what
i?m
trying
to
get
across,
say
that
georgia
has
an
election
code,
a
comprehensive
body
of
law
on
elections.
if
we
change
10
code
sections
and
send
them
to
washington,
we
think
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
entitled
to
disapprove
other
sections
in
georgia?s
election
code.
but
here,
the
attorney
general
disapproved
georgia?s
use
of
multimember
districts
in
combination
with
the
majority
run-off
requirement
and
numbered
posts,
and
georgia
had
not
changed
that.
if
we
change
the
system,
the
attorney
general
could
object
to
our
change
in
the
system,
but
if
we
change
the
lines
and
the
reapportion,
we
don?t
think
that
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
object
to
the
system.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
voting
law
affects
the
voting.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
voting
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
voting
right
act.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
of
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
right.
but
this
has
effect
on
the
voter.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
excuse
me.
i?m
talking
about
changing
the
location
of
a
polling
place.
this
affects
the
voter.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i?m
sorry.
i
don?t
believe
that
we
necessarily
change
the
location
of
polling
places.
the
polling
places
stay
the
same.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no
but
in
georgia,
we
do
not
have
to
go
another
place.
we
go
to
the
same
polling
place
and
vote
for
different
numbered
seats
in
the
legislature.
but
the
effect
on
the
voter
is
not
in
whether
he
goes
to
the
same
poll
to
vote
or
not.
our
argument
is
to
the
third
question
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
without
statutory
authority
adopted
regulations
imposing
a
burden
of
proof
standard
on
the
state
to
satisfy
him
and
we
believe
that
this
is
contrary
to
what
this
court
had
in
mind
in
allen
when
it
said
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
act
as
a
court
in
approving
or
disapproving
the
state
legislation.
we
believe
that
these
procedures
are
contrary
to
morgan
versus
the
united
states
in
304
u.s.
and
the
cases
which
followed
it
through
hannah
v.
larche
in
363
u.s.
and
the
final
question
raises
the
issue
as
to
whether
attorney
general
can
promulgate
regulations
in
any
of
them
at
all,
but
particularly
regulations
changing
the
60-day
time
limit
which
congress
placed
on
him.
the
government's
brief
cites
no
authority
for
him
being
able
to
adapt
regulations.
they
cite
is
a
need
for
additional
information
and
we
submit
the
basis
--
the
arguments
based
on
needs
should
be
addressed
to
the
congress.
the
attorney
general,
the
united
states
above
all
owes
the
submitting
stage
obedience
to
the
time
limits
fixed
by
congress.
in
conclusion,
if
i
may
take
a
hint
from
the
gentleman
who
opened
the
city
of
burbank
case
yesterday,
in
his
opening
argument
he
referred
to
the
declaration
of
independence
and
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
grievances
against
the
king
laws
that
he
has
forbidden
his
governors
to
pass
laws
of
immediate
and
pressing
importance
unless
suspended
in
their
operation
till
his
assent
should
be
obtained.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
somewhat
at
a
loss
for
words
to
learn
that
the
united
states
takes
a
position
that
they
can
sue
the
state
of
georgia
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
one
of
our
defenses
can
only
be
raised
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
i
would
have
thought
that
when
they
sued
us,
we
would
be
entitled
to
all
available
defenses
and
would
not
be
required
to
raise
any
of
those
defenses
in
a
forum
other
than
the
one
that
the
united
states
had
chosen.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
allen
dealt
with
a
situation
where
a
citizen
is
suing
for
a
declaration
or
a
determination
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
there
has
been
a
submission
here,
may
it
please
the
court
and
the
question
is
the
validity
of
the
objection
or
when
it
was
turned
down.
those
factors
were
not
present
in
allen
and
in
perkins,
because
there
had
been
no
submission,
no
objection
by
the
attorney
general.
in
the
reapportionment
context
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
to
raise
the
defense
that
the
objection
was
invalid,
that
the
attorney
general
objected
to
things
which
had
not
changed.
in
a
reapportionment
context,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
really
a
viable
alternative
for
this
reason.
as
i
understand
it,
the
united
states
would
have
60
days
in
which
to
answer
the
complaint
or
a
complaint
for
declaratory
judgment
filed
in
the
dc
district
court
and
then
it
might
take
a
considerable
period
of
time
for
the
district
court
to
make
a
determination
and
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
would
not
be
able
to
formulate
a
plan,
would
not
be
able
to
permit
the
holding
of
elections
in
the
meantime
and
therefore
is
just
not
the
good
way
for
a
state
to
go
to
submit
its
reapportionment
plans
for
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
because
of
the
time
involved
and
the
lack
of
remedial
power
that
that
court
would
have.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
would,
perhaps
a
suit
not
under
the
act,
but
a
suit
for
injunction
or
something
of
that
type
by
the
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
but
if
it
was
under
the
act,
i
think
that
the
only
issue
before
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
would
be
whether
or
not
the
change
had
the
purpose
or
effect
of
racial
voting
discrimination.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
1972
plan
repealed
the
1971
plan
and
that
now
the
question
of
timeliness
is
moot,
but
the
1972
plan
was
disapproved.
it
is
not
in
effect,
the
repealer
clause
contained
in
the
1972
plan
is
not
in
effect.
so,
if
the
1972
plan
is
not
in
effect,
the
1971
plan
is,
and
we
think
that
the
case
is
not
moot
or
the
question
is
not
moot.
now,
i?d
like
to
refer
to
just
one
other
matter
and
that
is
the
allen
decision.
the
court
is
of
course
familiar
with
the
several
lines
in
allen
dealing
with
reapportionment.
i
would
like
to
complete
the
last
portion
of
the
senate?s
read
to
the
court
yesterday.
the
court
there
said,
?we
leave
to
another
case
a
consideration
of
any
possible
conflict,
therefore
i
submit?
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
on
allen,
it?s
at
page
569.
i
submit
that
if
congress
did
adopt
allen
when
it
was
considering
the
1972
amendments,
that
congress
did
not
adopt
anything
that
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
and
that
they
clearly,
the
court
left
some
matters
at
least
with
respect
to
reapportionment
undecided
in
allen
and
that
congress
has
not
adopted
those
undecided
maps.
