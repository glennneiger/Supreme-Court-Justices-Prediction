justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
trouble
with
which
case
was
perkins?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
case
it
was,
it
said
a
change
from
war
elections
to
a
large
elections
for
a
legislative
body
was
within
the
reach
of
the
successive
body?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
--
i
understand
that
frequently
happens
but
how
about
principle
of
it?
you
don?t
have
any
trouble
at
all
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don?t
blame
it
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that,
but
how
about
the
principle
of
it?
how
can
you
really
sensibly
distinguish
the
two
cases
other
than
by
just
saying
they?re
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
really
have
to
cut
back
on
perkins
a
little?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
really
can?t
distinguish
them
and
if
perkins
is
still
the
law,
you
lose
on
this
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
an
apportionment?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
perkins
election
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
had
whether
you
are
going
to
elect
the
members
of
legislative
body
in
boards
or
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
only
member
district
is
against
single-member
district,
presents
the
identical
question,
whether
you
are
going
to
elect
them
in
boards
or
or
a
party
(inaudible)
hearing,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
just
don?t
--
they
just
--
if
the
--
it
just
makes
the
questions
we?re
not
dealing
with
now
we
have
to
deal
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
voting
locations
on
a
precinct?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
change
that
law,
you
change
everything
except
the
--
by
changing
the
lines
you
would
change
the
?
whether
it
would
change
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
voting
laws
as
to
which
voting
machine
you
can
go
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
to
redrawing
a
line
district
line.
since,
when
you
draw
this
machine
you
go
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
rather
--
it
changes
the
location
of
my
voting
machine,
if
you
draw
the
line
on
the
other
side
of
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter,
it
affects
me
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
can
put
it
in
another
district,
i
have
to
put
on
another
district,
it
changes
my
voting
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
but
the
changes
--
it
affects
me
as
a
voter
like
go
to
another
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
it
--
was
that
the
attorney
general
first
started
passing
on
reapportionment
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
have
been
a
year
or
more
than
that
the
reapportionment
when
the
statute
was
reenacted?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
really
in
quite
reference
to
that
situation
of
the
legislative
history?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
the
appointment?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
were
--
the
government
thought
that
the
case
--
that
case
has
been
decided
without
reaching
the
reapportionment
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
the
court
didn?t
adapt
the
government?s
narrow
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
apparently
sometimes
you
can?t
make
up
your
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
in
this
case,
you
essentially
say,
you
really
can?t
--
in
effect
you
say
can?t
decide
it
one
way
or
the
other
and
therefore
you
object
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
characteristic
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
thought
you
said
you?ve
suppose
to
object
in
60
days
or
it
goes
into
effect
or
just
rule
that
says
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
then,
you
are
supposed
to
disapprove,
it
goes
into
effect
unless
you
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
could
say,
we
object
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
only
on
the
assumption
that
it?s
a
method
that
the
attorney
general
to
say
i
object,
that?s
another
issue
in
the
case
because
your
position
states
the
statute
is
presumptively
unconstitutional
or
invalid
unless
the
state
carries
the
burden
of
proving
that
it?s
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
this
is
--
you
would
have
taken
the
attorney
general
to
the
court
and
i?m
not
so
sure
that
that
was
whether
a
state
necessarily
has
to
march
up
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government
to
prove
its
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
didn?t
allen
deal
with
that
in
our
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
never
get
to
the
merits
of
the
law
where
there
has
been
no
submission?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
suggestion
is
that
in
this
case
you
should
be
allowed
to
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
is
that?

you
