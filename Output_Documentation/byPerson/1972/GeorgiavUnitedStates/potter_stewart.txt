let
me
be
sure
i
understand
this
designated
post
requirement.
that
would
mean
that
even
though
you
got
a
greater
vote
and
then
somebody
else
who
got
elected
to
another
post,
if
that
wasn?t
your
designated
post,
you
could
still
lose?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
assuming
more
than
two
members.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
might
get
the
49%
of
the
vote
in
post
--
for
post
1
and
your
two
opponents
would
divide
51%,
you
would
have
a
runoff
often?
justice
potter
stewart
between
you
and
the
highest?
justice
potter
stewart
the
higher
of
the
other
two?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
as
you
aren?t
running,
even
if
the
incumbent
wasn't
running?
justice
potter
stewart
that?s
best
seat?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
member
district.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
who
is
to
decide
that
whether
there
has
been
a
sufficient
submission?
is
that
entirely
on
the
attorney
general?s
unreviewable
discretion?
if
so,
he
could
just
string
this
thing
along
forever
and
while
the
statute
review
requires
him
to
object
within
60
days.
justice
potter
stewart
where,
where
under
the
statute
is
there
judicially
review?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
an
alternative,
isn?t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that?s
an
alternative.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here
he
hasn?t.
the
point
is
he
just
could.
as
i
understand
your
theory,
you
could
just
say
i
am
sorry
i
don?t
have
enough
information,
give
me
some
more.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
sorry,
that
is
not
sufficient,
give
me
some
more
and
he
could
string
it
on
forever.
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
statute
requires
is
a
submission
of
the
--
as
the
statute
says,
qualification,
prerequisites,
standard
practice
or
procedure,
not
a
lot
of
explanatory
material.
isn?t
that
up
to
the
justice
department
within
60-days
after
that
submission
required
by
that
statute
to
object
and
if
it
hasn?t
been
objected
then
it
becomes
the
law
of
the
state.
that
is
what
the
statute
contemplates,
isn?t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
anything
in
our
opinions
in
allen
or
perkins
or
any
other
had
to
say
anything
about
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
submission
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
the
reason
was
that
the
states
thought
that
they
had
a
lower
burden
of
proof
when
they
were
submitting
it
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
ago?
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
enactment
of
the
--
after
the
present
amendments
