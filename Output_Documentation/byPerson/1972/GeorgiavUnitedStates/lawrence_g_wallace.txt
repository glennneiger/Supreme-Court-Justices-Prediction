mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
following
the
1970
census,
the
georgia
legislature
in
the
fall
of
1971
enacted
three
separate
reapportionments
statutes.
one
each
for
state
senate
and
house
and
one
for
the
congressional
districts.
each
of
these
statutes
repealed
the
previous
districting.
the
state
separately
submitted
the
three
reapportionment
plans
to
the
attorney
general
for
review
under
section
5
and
the
state?s
submission
for
the
georgia
house
which
is
what
is
directly
at
issue
here,
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
19.
we
think
it's
rather
significant
that
on
page
21
of
the
appendix,
the
state
explained
that
the
georgia
house
of
representatives
also
reapportioned
in
1968.
this
change
was
not
submitted
because
at
that
time,
prior
to
allen
the
board
of
elections
393
u.s.
544,
it
was
believed
to
be
unnecessary
to
submit
reapportion
plans
to
the
united
states
attorney
general
pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act.
following
a
preliminary
examination,
the
attorney
general
determined
that
the
data
sent
were
insufficient
for
proper
evaluation
of
the
proposed
changes
and
requested
specific
additional
information
in
accordance
with
the
department?s
published
guidelines
which
the
state
then
submitted
and
within
60
days
of
the
submission
of
that
additional
information,
the
attorney
general
interposed
objections
to
all
three
plans.
objections
to
apparent
racial
gerrymandering
in
the
congressional
and
state
senate
plans
and
to
certain
aspects
of
the
house
plan,
including
the
use
of
multimember
districts
coupled
with
numbered
posts
and
the
majority
run
off
requirement
which
has
the
effect
of
requiring
each
candidate
in
order
to
elected
to
win
a
majority
of
all
the
voters
in
the
entire
multimember
district.
in
response
to
these
objections,
the
georgia
legislature
enacted
modifications
to
the
senate
and
congressional
plans
eliminating
the
racial
gerrymandering
objected
to
and
upon
resubmission,
those
plans
were
found
acceptable
by
the
attorney
general
and
those
resubmitted
districts
were
used
in
the
1972
elections.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
congressional
districts
reconstituted
after
the
attorney
general?s
initial
objection,
elected
the
first
black
congressman
from
georgia
since
reconstruction.
now
those
congressional
and
state
senate
reapportionments
are
not
presently
the
subject
of
any
litigation
and
are
not
directly
at
issue
on
this
case.
they
could
of
course
possibly
be
effective
in
the
future.
with
respect
to
the
georgia
house
which
is
an
issue,
i
believe
the
history
was
recounted
by
mr.
hill
of
how
the
house
founded
that
they
could
not
satisfy
all
of
the
objections
raised
by
the
attorney
general
and
although
they
abandoned
some
of
the
multimember
districts,
they
specifically
decline
to
abandon
others
and
adapt
the
resolution
saying
that
they
were
going
to
invoke
the
remedial
power
of
the
federal
courts.
nine
days
after
submission
of
this
1972
plan,
that
the
state
sent
in,
the
attorney
general
interposed
an
objection
and
three
days
later,
the
united
states
commenced
the
present
action
in
the
district
court
to
restrain
the
state
from
implementing
either
of
the
submitted
house
plans
and
asking
that
the
legislature
be
directed
to
adapt
a
satisfactory
plan
that
conforms
to
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
requirements
or
in
the
alternative
that
such
a
plan
be
devised
by
the
district
court.
and
the
three-judge
court
unanimously
granted
the
relief
requested
by
the
government,
but
its
judgment
was
stayed
by
order
of
this
court
and
in
1972
elections
were
held
under
the
1972
plan
to
which
the
attorney
general
had
objected
with
respect
to
the
house.
the
other
elections
were
conducted
unto
the
reconstituted
plans,
plans
reconstituted
in
response
to
the
attorney
general?s
objections.
now,
we
contend
first
that
there
is
no
substantial
basis
for
doubt
that
the
congress
that
reenacted
the
voting
rights
act
in
1970,
understood
and
intended
that
the
act
would
apply
to
reapportionment
legislation
as
well
as
to
other
changes
in
voting
and
election
laws.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1965
act
had
been
in
some
respects
equivocal
with
respect
to
coverage
and
this
court
examined
that
history
in
detail
in
allen
against
the
state
board
of
elections
which
was
decided
early
in
1969.
and
it
concluded
in
that
case
that
congress
intended
section
5,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
to
have
the
broadest
possible
scope
and
that
the
legislative
history
on
the
whole
supports
the
view
that
congress
intended
to
reach
any
state
enactment
which
altered
the
election
law
of
a
covered
state
in
even
a
minor
way.
that
the
court
in
allen
used
this
language
to
refer
not
only
to
changes
in
state
law
that
would
deprive
persons
of
their
franchise
altogether,
but
also
the
changes
that
would
abridge
the
effectiveness
of
that
franchise
by
diluting
their
voting
power
was
made
clear
by
the
holding
in
one
of
the
four
cases
decided
in
the
allen
opinion.
the
first
of
the
district
anger
at
large
decisions
on
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
after
the
decision
in
allen
that
they
begun
to
be
submitted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
early
1969,
in
march
of
1969.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
references
to
allen
and
to
the
interpretation
of
the
act
in
allen.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it?s
replete
with
references
to
reapportionment
also
and
the
two
sometimes
they
tie
together
and
sometimes
are
not.
but
what
i
was
about
to
point
out
to
the
court
was
that
as
recounted
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
one
of
the
cases
decided
in
allen,
a
case
called
fairley
against
patterson
was
what
is
referred
to
as
number
25
in
this
quotation,
number
25
involves
a
change
from
district
to
at
large
voting
for
county
supervisors.
the
right
to
vote
can
be
affected
by
a
dilution
of
voting
power
as
well
as
by
an
absolute
prohibition
on
casting
a
ballot
citing
reynolds
against
sims
and
then,
noting
that
voters
who
are
members
of
a
racial
minority
might
well
be
in
the
majority
in
one
district
but
then
it
decided
minority
and
the
county
as
a
whole
and
that
this
type
of
change
is
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
that
was
part
of
the
holding
in
allen
along
with
much
general
language
in
the
opinion
broadly
interpreting
the
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
--
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
reenactment
no
one
raised
any
question
or
doubt
that
reapportion
of
legislation
would
be
covered.
the
entire
discussion
was
to
the
contrary.
the
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
testifying
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
at
the
hearings,
who
was
testifying
in
opposition
to
the
extension
of
section
5,
specifically
said,
?that
under
section
5
all
of
these
reapportionments
and
redistricting
plans
would
have
to
be
submitted.?
that
was
his
interpretation
of
what
the
duty
would
be
under
the
allen
decision.
many
proponents
of
the
act
referred
specifically
to
reapportionment
or
redistricting
or
drawing
of
new
boundary
lines
in
some
instances
as
among
the
new
devices
that
it
come
to
the
floor
that
could
adversely
affect
minority
voting
rights
and
as
a
reason
for
extending
the
pre-clearance,
the
pre-implementation
review
provisions
of
section
5.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
most
contested
issue
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
1970
enactment
was
whether
section
5
would
be
extended
or
not.
this
was
the
major
bone
of
contention.
this
was
not
merely
a
proforma
reenactment
of
a
statute
about
to
expire.
the
administration
had
proposed
that
section
5
should
not
be
continued.
the
act
should
be
revised
in
a
way
that
congress
after
extensive
deliberations,
after
hearings
in
both
houses
and
after
extensive
floor
debate
concluded
not
to
accept.
instead,
congress
decided
that
the
remedy
provided
in
section
5
was
needed
and
the
president
signed
that
enactment
into
law.
it
is
difficult
to
review
this
legislative
history
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
knowingly
in
effect
ratified
the
allen
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
acted
on
the
premise
and
on
the
assumption
that,
if
section
5
were
re-extended
which
it
decided
to
do,
reapportionments
resulting
from
the
1970
census
would
be
covered
insofar
as
there
were
reapportionments
put
into
effect
as
changes
by
the
state.
there?s
another
problem
that
a
federal
court
has,
a
decree
as
specific
reapportionment
as
has
risen
in
connor
case.
the
legislative
history
and
its
recounted
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief
in
our
support.
all
looks
in
the
one
direction
to
the
extent
that
it
sheds
light
on
this
issue
and
we
think
it's
sheds
very
considerable
light
on
this
issue.
and
perkins
versus
matthews
which
was
decided
under
the
1965
act,
but
subsequent
to
the
reenactment
by
this
court
made
clear
that
the
reasoning
of
allen
also
extends
to
other
changes
in
boundary
lines,
in
that
case
an
annexation
change
in
the
boundary
lines
and
not
merely
to
a
change
from
districting
to
a
large
elections,
the
change
in
boundary
lines.
the
opinion
of
the
court
relied
extensively
in
the
case
on
the
reasoning
of
allen
in
a
separate
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
and
joined
by
the
chief
justice
found
one
sentence
sufficient
to
decide
the
question.
one
sentence
saying
that
given
the
decision
in
allen,
we
concur
in
the
judgment
of
reversal
and
the
order
of
agreement
here
because
this
changing
boundary
lines
was
indistinguishable
from
the
reasoning
in
allen
which
in
our
view,
congress
clearly
ratified.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
wrote
an
opinion
saying
that
in
allen
that
he
said
that
the
court,
he?d
agreed
with
the
way
the
court
interpreted
the
act,
but
he
still
was
dissenting
on
the
constitutional
issue
of
the
submission.
and
to
my
knowledge,
the
most
effective
statement
of
that
position
on
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
his
dissenting
opinion
starting
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
i
haven?t
seen
anything
more
forceful
on
that
subject,
but
he
has
always
been
alone
in
this
court.
his
dissenting
view
on
the
constitutionality
is
ultimately
premised
largely
on
a
review
of
the
history
of
the
constitutional
convention.
and
the
majority
of
the
court
decided
that
that
view
takes
too
restrictive
of
the
view
of
the
remedial
powers
which
were
later
conferred
on
congress
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we
see
no
novel
constitutional
issue
presented
here.
we
think
the
issue
is
fully
considered
and
decided
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
and
reaffirmed
in
allen
and
in
perkins.
and
since
the
state
is
not
asking
if
those
cases
be
overruled,
we
don?t
intend
to
argue
the
constitutional
issue
at
length.
there
is
also
dictum
in
allen
with
respect
to
reapportionment
itself
and
here,
i
differ
with
counsel
for
the
state
that,
that
dictum
really
reserves
the
question
whether
a
reapportionment
should
be
covered
by
the
act.
instead
what
it
says
is
that
administrative
problems
may
arise
with
respect
to
application
of
the
act
to
reapportionment
and
we
leave
those
administrative
problems
on
how
to
resolve
them
to
another
day.
but
that
paragraph
ends
on
page
569
of
390.
u.s.,
the
argument
that
some
administrative
problem
might
arise
in
the
future
does
not
establish
that
congress
intended
that
section
5
have
a
narrow
scope.
also,
being
in
the
context
of
reapportionment
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
government
thought
that,
but
the
court
adapted
a
very
broad
interpretation
of
the
act
in
allen
whether
the
government
would
have
taken
that
position,
had
it
known
how
the
court
would
reason
in
its
opinion,
i
have
no
way
of
saying.
but
the
upshot
of
allen
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
court
implied
very
strongly
that
reapportionment
like
other
changes
was
covered.
i
don?t
want
to
characterize
the
government?s
view
to
the
degree.
the
upshot
of
allen
was
that
it
became
widely
understood
that
reapportionment
law
should
then
be
submitted
and
starting
in
1969
to
1972,
381
such
laws
have
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
federal
courts
would
have
passed
on
the
subject,
including
the
court
below
and
others
that
we
cite
on
page
24
of
our
brief
have
taken
the
position
that
reapportionment
laws
like
other
changes
in
the
election
laws,
like
other
changes
in
district
lines
are
covered
by
the
act.
and
we
have
found
in
the
course
of
passing
on
these
381
submissions
that
some
administrative
problems
undeniably
have
arisen.
they
have
not
proved
to
be
insurmountable.
there
has
been
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don?t
know
what
time
you
have
in
mind,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
merely
a
polite
way
of
saying
that
the
state
had
not
met
its
burden
of
proof.
it
wasn?t
that
we
couldn?t
make
up
our
minds.
the
state
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
wouldn?t
have
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
the
change
would
not
have
such
in
effect
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it?s
sometimes
phrased
in
different
ways.
there
is
a
certain
politeness
used
in
correspondence
with
the
state
which
is
preferred
to
using
the
strongest
possible
language
in
this
situation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
within
60
days
of
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
unless,
we
interpose
an
objection
which
these
matters
were.
i
mean,
no
one
had
any
doubt
to
what
these
letters
were
in
objection
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
we
don?t
have
to
say
on
what
basis
and
it
is
not
for
the
attorney
general
to
redraw
the
apportionment
in
some
way.
the
procedures
that
took
place
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
were
at
the
request
of
the
district
court
in
a
effort
by
counsel
on
both
sides
to
expedite
a
resolution
that
would
be
acceptable
to
the
attorney
general.
and
that
would
enable
the
georgia
house
to
reapportion
itself
in
time
for
the
upcoming
primary
elections
after
two
unsuccessful
submissions
to
washington
with
respect
to
the
house.
the
other
matters
have
been
straightened
out.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that?d
be
fine,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
[attempt
to
laughter]
alright.
well,
just
to
open
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
change,
the
logical
extension
of
the
state?s
argument
here
would
be
that
it
could
reapportion
by
electing
all
members
of
the
georgia
house
at
large
and
this
would
not
be
a
change
that
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
even
though
the
affect
on
minority
voting
rights
would
obviously
be
a
very
drastic
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
relates
to
the
submission
of
now
repealed
1971
plan.
this
court?s
own
experience
in
dealing
with
the
complexities
of
the
matters
such
as
racial
discrimination
and
reapportionments
surely
instructs
that
if
the
act
is
meaningfully
to
be
applied,
the
necessary
information
must
be
submitted
to
the
reviewing
authority
so
that
he
can
make
a
meaningful
determination
of
whether
the
implementation
of
the
proposed
change
would
have
the
prohibited
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
position
that
the
attorney
general
came
to
in
the
guidelines
which
were
adopted
after
publication
in
the
federal
register
in
commentary
and
then
were
adopted
and
are
now
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
those
guidelines
interpreted
the
word
submission
in
the
act
and
in
the
submission
of
all
of
the
information
that
is
needed
in
order
for
a
determination
to
be
made.
and
when
less
than
that
information
is
initially
submitted,
the
attorney
general
specifies
within
60-days
of
the
initial
submission
what
additional
is
needed.
and
after
all
the
information
that
is
needed
to
make
a
meaningful
determination
is
submitted,
then
within
60
days
of
what
constitutes
a
submission
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
the
attorney
general
acts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
--
there
is
a
judicial
review
of
any
action
taken
and
it?s
always
open
to
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
a
general
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
is
correct.
that
alternative
is
open
to
the
state
before
or
after
the
attorney
general
has
interposed
any
objection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
satisfies
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
specifies
what?s
needed
and
the
regulations
themselves,
the
guidelines
specify
what
is
needed
and
this
just
hasn?t
occurred
that
there
have
been
successive
requests
for
additional
information.
here,
there
was
no
problem
of
that
kind
at
all.
the
state
did
submit
the
additional
information
after
one
request
for
it.
and
that
additional
information
was
adequate
for
a
determination
to
be
made
with
respect
to
all
three
of
the
state?s
plans
and
the
determination
was
promptly
made
thereafter.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
one
way
to
look
at
the
request
for
additional
information
is
an
objection
that
the
state
has
not
met
its
burden
of
proof
on
the
basis
of
the
information
submitted
and
that
alternative
would
be
open
as
counsel
for
the
state
said
in
the
district
court
here,
if
the
state
would
win
on
this
issue
it
would
be
a
phyrric
victory,
he
said,
because
it
would
be
open
to
the
attorney
general
when
insufficient
information
for
him
to
say
that
it
was
acceptable
was
submitted
to
him
is
simply
to
say
he
objects,
until
a
new
submission
containing
more
information
is
forthcoming.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
--
that
was
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
that
the
state
was
to
have
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
act
does
not
require
the
state
to
make
a
submission
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
that
alternative
was
put
in
as
an
accommodation
to
the
states
if
they
would
prefer
that
to
go
into
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
open
to
them
before
or
after
they
make
their
submission
to
the
attorney
general
if
that?s
what
they
choose
to
do.
but
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
say
that
in
those
states,
covered
by
the
act
where
there
has
been
presumably
discrimination
in
the
past,
this
heavy
burden
reflected
in
decision
such
as
whitcomb
against
chavis
in
this
court,
a
heavy
burden
of
complainants
to
litigate
under
the
fifteen
amendment
will
be
shifted
to
the
state
if
a
change
in
the
state
laws
is
made.
the
house
report
is
very
specific
on
that
subject
in
referring
to
the
allen
decision.
it
says,
the
court
there
discussed
the
history
of
the
enforcement
of
section
5
and
clarified
its
scope.
the
decision
underscores
the
advantage
section
5
produces
in
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
covered
jurisdiction
to
show
that
the
new
voting
law
or
procedure
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color.
now,
that
basic
purpose
of
the
act
would
be
entirely
emasculated
if
the
alternative
were
open
to
the
state
to
make
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general
do
not
have
to
bear
that
burden
of
proof.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
will
completely
get
around
the
basic
objective
of
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
--
well,
let?s
look
at
the
act?s
provision.
i
think
the
legislative
history
makes
it
very
clear
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
section
5
is
set
forth
on
page
50
of
the
brief
for
the
appellants
and
it
says
that
--
reading
along
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page,
such
state
or
subdivision
may
institute
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
it
sets
qualification
prerequisite
standard
procedure
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote.
and
unless
and
until
the
court
enters
such
judgment,
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
vote,
the
right
to
vote
because
of
not
having
complied
with
that
and
a
party
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
would
ordinarily
carry
the
burden
of
proof
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
declaratory
judgment.
a
judgment
that
it
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
and
then
the
alternative
procedure
that?s
open
to
the
state
is
to
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general
and
if
he
does
not
interpose
an
objection,
then
the
state
can
put
it
into
effect
without
getting
the
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
doesn?t
specify.
the
proviso
doesn?t
specify
anything
about
the
burden
of
the
alternative.
it
is
accepted
that
it
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
doesn?t
object,
but
it
doesn?t
specify
any
standards
at
all
that
the
attorney
general
must
adhere
to
in
order
to
object.
so
far,
on
the
face
of
statute,
the
attorney
general
has
complete
discretion
to
interpose
an
objection
and
then,
(voice
overlap)
it
gives
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
says
that
if
the
attorney
general
is
free
to
interpose
an
objection
on
any
basis
he
pleases,
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
and
if
he
interposes
an
objection
then
the
state
can
go
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
statute
specifies
no
standard
at
all
that
the
attorney
general
must
adhere
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
did
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
as
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act,
that
is
why
pre-implementation
review
was
required
and
those
opinions
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
those
opinions
didn?t
deal
specifically
with
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
that?s
what
they
didn?t
involve,
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
but
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
see
how
if
the
state
doesn?t
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
such
a
submission,
the
purpose
of
the
act
can
be
accomplished.
the
fact
is
that
states
have
almost
invariably
made
their
submissions
to
the
attorney
general.
there
have
been
381
submissions
to
the
attorney
general
and
so
far
as
we
can
recollect,
only
three
suits
brought
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
two
of
those
after
the
attorney
general
interposed
objection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
attorney
general
specified
otherwise
in
published
guidelines.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
those
were
published
in
1970.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
was
the
basic
controversy
about
the
enactment
of
the
law
in
1965
and
its
reenactment
in
1970
and
the
opponents
of
section
5
said
that
it
was
not
a
good
idea
for
congress
to
take
away
the
presumption
of
validity
of
state
acts
and
to
single
out
certain
areas
of
the
country
where
the
act
would
apply.
and
majority
in
congress
took
the
other
view
that
because
of
the
background
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
voting
and
in
state
election
laws
there
would
be
areas
where
the
presumption
would
be
against
the
validity
of
new
election
laws
until
the
state
has
met
a
burden
of
proof
that
the
change
will
not
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
causing
racial
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
the
act
specifies
no
standard,
but
the
basic
controversy
in
congress
was
about
whether
this
presumption
of
validity
would
be
taken
away
in
the
covered
states.
and
in
the
1970
reenactment
in
particular,
the
position
of
the
administration
and
the
administration?s
proposal
is
that
this
presumption
of
validity
should
be
restored
and
section
5
should
not
be
extended
and
the
entire
country
should
be
treated
the
same.
and
congress
refused
to
accept
that
view
after
much
controversy
and
the
president
decided
to
sign
the
measure
into
law
and
accepted
congress?
point
of
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
--
of
course
it
has,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
was
in
situations
where
there
was
some
finality,
some
dispositive
nature
to
the
exercise
of
that
discretion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it?s
open
to
the
state
to
bring
a
completely
de
novo
proceeding
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
make
its
case
under
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
attorney
general
hasn?t
specified
anything
except
that
he
wasn?t
persuaded
that
it
wouldn?t
have
that
purpose
or
effect,
and
that
the
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
a
review
of
the
validity
of
his
determination
or
of
whether
that
determination
had
a
rational
basis.
it?s
a
completely
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
took
that
position
in
the
district
court
and
we
adhere
to
it
in
the
context
of
the
pervasive
reapportionment
that
was
enacted
here.
the
prior
apportionment
was
repealed
and
the
state
reconsidered
every
district
and
drew
new
district
lines
and
reapportioned
every
one.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
changes
were
very
pervasive
here.
most
districts
had
new
boundary
lines
under
both
the
1971
and
1972
plans
and
many
of
those
who
did
not
have
new
boundary
lines
had
a
different
number
of
representatives.
and
there
was
really
a
change
even
in
the
few
districts
that
had
the
same
boundary
lines,
the
same
number
of
representatives
because
they
were
sending
those
representatives
to
a
state
house
of
representatives
which
would
have
25
fewer
total
members.
so,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
can
really
be
said
that
there
is
no
district
which
remained
unaffected
by
the
reapportionment
legislation
and
we
did
take
the
position
that
the
entire
reapportionment
was
up
for
review.
now,
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
state,
they
say
yes,
there
were
changes
that
were
subject
to
review
under
section
5,
but
that
the
attorney
general?s
objection
is
invalid
because
what
he
objects
to
is
an
aspect
that
really
wasn?t
changed,
and
we
have
two
answers
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
as
we
understand
it,
that?s
a
contention
that
the
objection
is
not
well-founded.
that
the
objection
is
lacking
in
merit
and
under
allen
and
perkins,
congress
has
specified
that
that
question
can
be
litigated
only
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
is
the
contention
that
goes
to
the
merits
and
not
to
rather
--
there
was
a
change
which
had
to
be
submitted
here,
but
we
believe
that
the
objection
is
well-founded.
we
see
no
way
to
administer
the
act
other
than
to
consider
the
implementation,
the
effects
of
the
implementation
of
the
change
and
the
context
in
which
they
will
be
used.
the
act
says
that
if
implementation
of
that
change
will
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race,
then
that
change
should
not
be
implemented.
it
doesn?t
say
that
it
has
to
deny
or
abridge
the
right
to
vote
more
than
it
has
previously
been
denied
or
abridged.
and
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
the
court,
i
think
very
carefully
specified
that
the
pre-implementation
review
was
required
by
congress,
so
that
changes
in
the
election
laws
could
not
be
used
to
perpetuate.
the
word
used
there
was
?perpetuation,?
to
perpetuate
the
discrimination
on
account
of
race
in
voting
in
elections.
and
so
while
we
believe
that
the
matter
is
not
really
before
this
court,
we
think
the
objection
was
well-founded
here.
unless
there
is
no
further
question,
i
think
that
presents
our
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
following
the
1970
census,
the
georgia
legislature
in
the
fall
of
1971
enacted
three
separate
reapportionments
statutes.
one
each
for
state
senate
and
house
and
one
for
the
congressional
districts.
each
of
these
statutes
repealed
the
previous
districting.
the
state
separately
submitted
the
three
reapportionment
plans
to
the
attorney
general
for
review
under
section
5
and
the
state?s
submission
for
the
georgia
house
which
is
what
is
directly
at
issue
here,
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
19.
we
think
it's
rather
significant
that
on
page
21
of
the
appendix,
the
state
explained
that
the
georgia
house
of
representatives
also
reapportioned
in
1968.
this
change
was
not
submitted
because
at
that
time,
prior
to
allen
the
board
of
elections
393
u.s.
544,
it
was
believed
to
be
unnecessary
to
submit
reapportion
plans
to
the
united
states
attorney
general
pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act.
following
a
preliminary
examination,
the
attorney
general
determined
that
the
data
sent
were
insufficient
for
proper
evaluation
of
the
proposed
changes
and
requested
specific
additional
information
in
accordance
with
the
department?s
published
guidelines
which
the
state
then
submitted
and
within
60
days
of
the
submission
of
that
additional
information,
the
attorney
general
interposed
objections
to
all
three
plans.
objections
to
apparent
racial
gerrymandering
in
the
congressional
and
state
senate
plans
and
to
certain
aspects
of
the
house
plan,
including
the
use
of
multimember
districts
coupled
with
numbered
posts
and
the
majority
run
off
requirement
which
has
the
effect
of
requiring
each
candidate
in
order
to
elected
to
win
a
majority
of
all
the
voters
in
the
entire
multimember
district.
in
response
to
these
objections,
the
georgia
legislature
enacted
modifications
to
the
senate
and
congressional
plans
eliminating
the
racial
gerrymandering
objected
to
and
upon
resubmission,
those
plans
were
found
acceptable
by
the
attorney
general
and
those
resubmitted
districts
were
used
in
the
1972
elections.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
congressional
districts
reconstituted
after
the
attorney
general?s
initial
objection,
elected
the
first
black
congressman
from
georgia
since
reconstruction.
now
those
congressional
and
state
senate
reapportionments
are
not
presently
the
subject
of
any
litigation
and
are
not
directly
at
issue
on
this
case.
they
could
of
course
possibly
be
effective
in
the
future.
with
respect
to
the
georgia
house
which
is
an
issue,
i
believe
the
history
was
recounted
by
mr.
hill
of
how
the
house
founded
that
they
could
not
satisfy
all
of
the
objections
raised
by
the
attorney
general
and
although
they
abandoned
some
of
the
multimember
districts,
they
specifically
decline
to
abandon
others
and
adapt
the
resolution
saying
that
they
were
going
to
invoke
the
remedial
power
of
the
federal
courts.
nine
days
after
submission
of
this
1972
plan,
that
the
state
sent
in,
the
attorney
general
interposed
an
objection
and
three
days
later,
the
united
states
commenced
the
present
action
in
the
district
court
to
restrain
the
state
from
implementing
either
of
the
submitted
house
plans
and
asking
that
the
legislature
be
directed
to
adapt
a
satisfactory
plan
that
conforms
to
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
requirements
or
in
the
alternative
that
such
a
plan
be
devised
by
the
district
court.
and
the
three-judge
court
unanimously
granted
the
relief
requested
by
the
government,
but
its
judgment
was
stayed
by
order
of
this
court
and
in
1972
elections
were
held
under
the
1972
plan
to
which
the
attorney
general
had
objected
with
respect
to
the
house.
the
other
elections
were
conducted
unto
the
reconstituted
plans,
plans
reconstituted
in
response
to
the
attorney
general?s
objections.
now,
we
contend
first
that
there
is
no
substantial
basis
for
doubt
that
the
congress
that
reenacted
the
voting
rights
act
in
1970,
understood
and
intended
that
the
act
would
apply
to
reapportionment
legislation
as
well
as
to
other
changes
in
voting
and
election
laws.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1965
act
had
been
in
some
respects
equivocal
with
respect
to
coverage
and
this
court
examined
that
history
in
detail
in
allen
against
the
state
board
of
elections
which
was
decided
early
in
1969.
and
it
concluded
in
that
case
that
congress
intended
section
5,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
to
have
the
broadest
possible
scope
and
that
the
legislative
history
on
the
whole
supports
the
view
that
congress
intended
to
reach
any
state
enactment
which
altered
the
election
law
of
a
covered
state
in
even
a
minor
way.
that
the
court
in
allen
used
this
language
to
refer
not
only
to
changes
in
state
law
that
would
deprive
persons
of
their
franchise
altogether,
but
also
the
changes
that
would
abridge
the
effectiveness
of
that
franchise
by
diluting
their
voting
power
was
made
clear
by
the
holding
in
one
of
the
four
cases
decided
in
the
allen
opinion.
the
first
of
the
district
anger
at
large
decisions
on
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
after
the
decision
in
allen
that
they
begun
to
be
submitted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
early
1969,
in
march
of
1969.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
references
to
allen
and
to
the
interpretation
of
the
act
in
allen.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it?s
replete
with
references
to
reapportionment
also
and
the
two
sometimes
they
tie
together
and
sometimes
are
not.
but
what
i
was
about
to
point
out
to
the
court
was
that
as
recounted
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
one
of
the
cases
decided
in
allen,
a
case
called
fairley
against
patterson
was
what
is
referred
to
as
number
25
in
this
quotation,
number
25
involves
a
change
from
district
to
at
large
voting
for
county
supervisors.
the
right
to
vote
can
be
affected
by
a
dilution
of
voting
power
as
well
as
by
an
absolute
prohibition
on
casting
a
ballot
citing
reynolds
against
sims
and
then,
noting
that
voters
who
are
members
of
a
racial
minority
might
well
be
in
the
majority
in
one
district
but
then
it
decided
minority
and
the
county
as
a
whole
and
that
this
type
of
change
is
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
that
was
part
of
the
holding
in
allen
along
with
much
general
language
in
the
opinion
broadly
interpreting
the
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
--
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
reenactment
no
one
raised
any
question
or
doubt
that
reapportion
of
legislation
would
be
covered.
the
entire
discussion
was
to
the
contrary.
the
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
testifying
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
at
the
hearings,
who
was
testifying
in
opposition
to
the
extension
of
section
5,
specifically
said,
?that
under
section
5
all
of
these
reapportionments
and
redistricting
plans
would
have
to
be
submitted.?
that
was
his
interpretation
of
what
the
duty
would
be
under
the
allen
decision.
many
proponents
of
the
act
referred
specifically
to
reapportionment
or
redistricting
or
drawing
of
new
boundary
lines
in
some
instances
as
among
the
new
devices
that
it
come
to
the
floor
that
could
adversely
affect
minority
voting
rights
and
as
a
reason
for
extending
the
pre-clearance,
the
pre-implementation
review
provisions
of
section
5.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
most
contested
issue
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
1970
enactment
was
whether
section
5
would
be
extended
or
not.
this
was
the
major
bone
of
contention.
this
was
not
merely
a
proforma
reenactment
of
a
statute
about
to
expire.
the
administration
had
proposed
that
section
5
should
not
be
continued.
the
act
should
be
revised
in
a
way
that
congress
after
extensive
deliberations,
after
hearings
in
both
houses
and
after
extensive
floor
debate
concluded
not
to
accept.
instead,
congress
decided
that
the
remedy
provided
in
section
5
was
needed
and
the
president
signed
that
enactment
into
law.
it
is
difficult
to
review
this
legislative
history
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
knowingly
in
effect
ratified
the
allen
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
acted
on
the
premise
and
on
the
assumption
that,
if
section
5
were
re-extended
which
it
decided
to
do,
reapportionments
resulting
from
the
1970
census
would
be
covered
insofar
as
there
were
reapportionments
put
into
effect
as
changes
by
the
state.
there?s
another
problem
that
a
federal
court
has,
a
decree
as
specific
reapportionment
as
has
risen
in
connor
case.
the
legislative
history
and
its
recounted
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief
in
our
support.
all
looks
in
the
one
direction
to
the
extent
that
it
sheds
light
on
this
issue
and
we
think
it's
sheds
very
considerable
light
on
this
issue.
and
perkins
versus
matthews
which
was
decided
under
the
1965
act,
but
subsequent
to
the
reenactment
by
this
court
made
clear
that
the
reasoning
of
allen
also
extends
to
other
changes
in
boundary
lines,
in
that
case
an
annexation
change
in
the
boundary
lines
and
not
merely
to
a
change
from
districting
to
a
large
elections,
the
change
in
boundary
lines.
the
opinion
of
the
court
relied
extensively
in
the
case
on
the
reasoning
of
allen
in
a
separate
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
and
joined
by
the
chief
justice
found
one
sentence
sufficient
to
decide
the
question.
one
sentence
saying
that
given
the
decision
in
allen,
we
concur
in
the
judgment
of
reversal
and
the
order
of
agreement
here
because
this
changing
boundary
lines
was
indistinguishable
from
the
reasoning
in
allen
which
in
our
view,
congress
clearly
ratified.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
wrote
an
opinion
saying
that
in
allen
that
he
said
that
the
court,
he?d
agreed
with
the
way
the
court
interpreted
the
act,
but
he
still
was
dissenting
on
the
constitutional
issue
of
the
submission.
and
to
my
knowledge,
the
most
effective
statement
of
that
position
on
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
his
dissenting
opinion
starting
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
i
haven?t
seen
anything
more
forceful
on
that
subject,
but
he
has
always
been
alone
in
this
court.
his
dissenting
view
on
the
constitutionality
is
ultimately
premised
largely
on
a
review
of
the
history
of
the
constitutional
convention.
and
the
majority
of
the
court
decided
that
that
view
takes
too
restrictive
of
the
view
of
the
remedial
powers
which
were
later
conferred
on
congress
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we
see
no
novel
constitutional
issue
presented
here.
we
think
the
issue
is
fully
considered
and
decided
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
and
reaffirmed
in
allen
and
in
perkins.
and
since
the
state
is
not
asking
if
those
cases
be
overruled,
we
don?t
intend
to
argue
the
constitutional
issue
at
length.
there
is
also
dictum
in
allen
with
respect
to
reapportionment
itself
and
here,
i
differ
with
counsel
for
the
state
that,
that
dictum
really
reserves
the
question
whether
a
reapportionment
should
be
covered
by
the
act.
instead
what
it
says
is
that
administrative
problems
may
arise
with
respect
to
application
of
the
act
to
reapportionment
and
we
leave
those
administrative
problems
on
how
to
resolve
them
to
another
day.
but
that
paragraph
ends
on
page
569
of
390.
u.s.,
the
argument
that
some
administrative
problem
might
arise
in
the
future
does
not
establish
that
congress
intended
that
section
5
have
a
narrow
scope.
also,
being
in
the
context
of
reapportionment
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
government
thought
that,
but
the
court
adapted
a
very
broad
interpretation
of
the
act
in
allen
whether
the
government
would
have
taken
that
position,
had
it
known
how
the
court
would
reason
in
its
opinion,
i
have
no
way
of
saying.
but
the
upshot
of
allen
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
court
implied
very
strongly
that
reapportionment
like
other
changes
was
covered.
i
don?t
want
to
characterize
the
government?s
view
to
the
degree.
the
upshot
of
allen
was
that
it
became
widely
understood
that
reapportionment
law
should
then
be
submitted
and
starting
in
1969
to
1972,
381
such
laws
have
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
federal
courts
would
have
passed
on
the
subject,
including
the
court
below
and
others
that
we
cite
on
page
24
of
our
brief
have
taken
the
position
that
reapportionment
laws
like
other
changes
in
the
election
laws,
like
other
changes
in
district
lines
are
covered
by
the
act.
and
we
have
found
in
the
course
of
passing
on
these
381
submissions
that
some
administrative
problems
undeniably
have
arisen.
they
have
not
proved
to
be
insurmountable.
there
has
been
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don?t
know
what
time
you
have
in
mind,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
merely
a
polite
way
of
saying
that
the
state
had
not
met
its
burden
of
proof.
it
wasn?t
that
we
couldn?t
make
up
our
minds.
the
state
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
wouldn?t
have
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
the
change
would
not
have
such
in
effect
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it?s
sometimes
phrased
in
different
ways.
there
is
a
certain
politeness
used
in
correspondence
with
the
state
which
is
preferred
to
using
the
strongest
possible
language
in
this
situation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
within
60
days
of
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
unless,
we
interpose
an
objection
which
these
matters
were.
i
mean,
no
one
had
any
doubt
to
what
these
letters
were
in
objection
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
we
don?t
have
to
say
on
what
basis
and
it
is
not
for
the
attorney
general
to
redraw
the
apportionment
in
some
way.
the
procedures
that
took
place
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
were
at
the
request
of
the
district
court
in
a
effort
by
counsel
on
both
sides
to
expedite
a
resolution
that
would
be
acceptable
to
the
attorney
general.
and
that
would
enable
the
georgia
house
to
reapportion
itself
in
time
for
the
upcoming
primary
elections
after
two
unsuccessful
submissions
to
washington
with
respect
to
the
house.
the
other
matters
have
been
straightened
out.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that?d
be
fine,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
[attempt
to
laughter]
alright.
well,
just
to
open
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
change,
the
logical
extension
of
the
state?s
argument
here
would
be
that
it
could
reapportion
by
electing
all
members
of
the
georgia
house
at
large
and
this
would
not
be
a
change
that
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
even
though
the
affect
on
minority
voting
rights
would
obviously
be
a
very
drastic
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
relates
to
the
submission
of
now
repealed
1971
plan.
this
court?s
own
experience
in
dealing
with
the
complexities
of
the
matters
such
as
racial
discrimination
and
reapportionments
surely
instructs
that
if
the
act
is
meaningfully
to
be
applied,
the
necessary
information
must
be
submitted
to
the
reviewing
authority
so
that
he
can
make
a
meaningful
determination
of
whether
the
implementation
of
the
proposed
change
would
have
the
prohibited
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
position
that
the
attorney
general
came
to
in
the
guidelines
which
were
adopted
after
publication
in
the
federal
register
in
commentary
and
then
were
adopted
and
are
now
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
those
guidelines
interpreted
the
word
submission
in
the
act
and
in
the
submission
of
all
of
the
information
that
is
needed
in
order
for
a
determination
to
be
made.
and
when
less
than
that
information
is
initially
submitted,
the
attorney
general
specifies
within
60-days
of
the
initial
submission
what
additional
is
needed.
and
after
all
the
information
that
is
needed
to
make
a
meaningful
determination
is
submitted,
then
within
60
days
of
what
constitutes
a
submission
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
the
attorney
general
acts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
--
there
is
a
judicial
review
of
any
action
taken
and
it?s
always
open
to
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
a
general
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
is
correct.
that
alternative
is
open
to
the
state
before
or
after
the
attorney
general
has
interposed
any
objection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
satisfies
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
specifies
what?s
needed
and
the
regulations
themselves,
the
guidelines
specify
what
is
needed
and
this
just
hasn?t
occurred
that
there
have
been
successive
requests
for
additional
information.
here,
there
was
no
problem
of
that
kind
at
all.
the
state
did
submit
the
additional
information
after
one
request
for
it.
and
that
additional
information
was
adequate
for
a
determination
to
be
made
with
respect
to
all
three
of
the
state?s
plans
and
the
determination
was
promptly
made
thereafter.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
one
way
to
look
at
the
request
for
additional
information
is
an
objection
that
the
state
has
not
met
its
burden
of
proof
on
the
basis
of
the
information
submitted
and
that
alternative
would
be
open
as
counsel
for
the
state
said
in
the
district
court
here,
if
the
state
would
win
on
this
issue
it
would
be
a
phyrric
victory,
he
said,
because
it
would
be
open
to
the
attorney
general
when
insufficient
information
for
him
to
say
that
it
was
acceptable
was
submitted
to
him
is
simply
to
say
he
objects,
until
a
new
submission
containing
more
information
is
forthcoming.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
--
that
was
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
that
the
state
was
to
have
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
act
does
not
require
the
state
to
make
a
submission
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
that
alternative
was
put
in
as
an
accommodation
to
the
states
if
they
would
prefer
that
to
go
into
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
open
to
them
before
or
after
they
make
their
submission
to
the
attorney
general
if
that?s
what
they
choose
to
do.
but
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
say
that
in
those
states,
covered
by
the
act
where
there
has
been
presumably
discrimination
in
the
past,
this
heavy
burden
reflected
in
decision
such
as
whitcomb
against
chavis
in
this
court,
a
heavy
burden
of
complainants
to
litigate
under
the
fifteen
amendment
will
be
shifted
to
the
state
if
a
change
in
the
state
laws
is
made.
the
house
report
is
very
specific
on
that
subject
in
referring
to
the
allen
decision.
it
says,
the
court
there
discussed
the
history
of
the
enforcement
of
section
5
and
clarified
its
scope.
the
decision
underscores
the
advantage
section
5
produces
in
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
covered
jurisdiction
to
show
that
the
new
voting
law
or
procedure
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color.
now,
that
basic
purpose
of
the
act
would
be
entirely
emasculated
if
the
alternative
were
open
to
the
state
to
make
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general
do
not
have
to
bear
that
burden
of
proof.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
will
completely
get
around
the
basic
objective
of
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
--
well,
let?s
look
at
the
act?s
provision.
i
think
the
legislative
history
makes
it
very
clear
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
section
5
is
set
forth
on
page
50
of
the
brief
for
the
appellants
and
it
says
that
--
reading
along
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page,
such
state
or
subdivision
may
institute
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
it
sets
qualification
prerequisite
standard
procedure
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote.
and
unless
and
until
the
court
enters
such
judgment,
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
vote,
the
right
to
vote
because
of
not
having
complied
with
that
and
a
party
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
would
ordinarily
carry
the
burden
of
proof
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
declaratory
judgment.
a
judgment
that
it
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
and
then
the
alternative
procedure
that?s
open
to
the
state
is
to
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general
and
if
he
does
not
interpose
an
objection,
then
the
state
can
put
it
into
effect
without
getting
the
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
doesn?t
specify.
the
proviso
doesn?t
specify
anything
about
the
burden
of
the
alternative.
it
is
accepted
that
it
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
doesn?t
object,
but
it
doesn?t
specify
any
standards
at
all
that
the
attorney
general
must
adhere
to
in
order
to
object.
so
far,
on
the
face
of
statute,
the
attorney
general
has
complete
discretion
to
interpose
an
objection
and
then,
(voice
overlap)
it
gives
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
says
that
if
the
attorney
general
is
free
to
interpose
an
objection
on
any
basis
he
pleases,
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
and
if
he
interposes
an
objection
then
the
state
can
go
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
statute
specifies
no
standard
at
all
that
the
attorney
general
must
adhere
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
did
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
as
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act,
that
is
why
pre-implementation
review
was
required
and
those
opinions
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
those
opinions
didn?t
deal
specifically
with
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
that?s
what
they
didn?t
involve,
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
but
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
see
how
if
the
state
doesn?t
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
such
a
submission,
the
purpose
of
the
act
can
be
accomplished.
the
fact
is
that
states
have
almost
invariably
made
their
submissions
to
the
attorney
general.
there
have
been
381
submissions
to
the
attorney
general
and
so
far
as
we
can
recollect,
only
three
suits
brought
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
two
of
those
after
the
attorney
general
interposed
objection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
attorney
general
specified
otherwise
in
published
guidelines.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
those
were
published
in
1970.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
was
the
basic
controversy
about
the
enactment
of
the
law
in
1965
and
its
reenactment
in
1970
and
the
opponents
of
section
5
said
that
it
was
not
a
good
idea
for
congress
to
take
away
the
presumption
of
validity
of
state
acts
and
to
single
out
certain
areas
of
the
country
where
the
act
would
apply.
and
majority
in
congress
took
the
other
view
that
because
of
the
background
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
voting
and
in
state
election
laws
there
would
be
areas
where
the
presumption
would
be
against
the
validity
of
new
election
laws
until
the
state
has
met
a
burden
of
proof
that
the
change
will
not
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
causing
racial
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
the
act
specifies
no
standard,
but
the
basic
controversy
in
congress
was
about
whether
this
presumption
of
validity
would
be
taken
away
in
the
covered
states.
and
in
the
1970
reenactment
in
particular,
the
position
of
the
administration
and
the
administration?s
proposal
is
that
this
presumption
of
validity
should
be
restored
and
section
5
should
not
be
extended
and
the
entire
country
should
be
treated
the
same.
and
congress
refused
to
accept
that
view
after
much
controversy
and
the
president
decided
to
sign
the
measure
into
law
and
accepted
congress?
point
of
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
--
of
course
it
has,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
was
in
situations
where
there
was
some
finality,
some
dispositive
nature
to
the
exercise
of
that
discretion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it?s
open
to
the
state
to
bring
a
completely
de
novo
proceeding
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
make
its
case
under
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
attorney
general
hasn?t
specified
anything
except
that
he
wasn?t
persuaded
that
it
wouldn?t
have
that
purpose
or
effect,
and
that
the
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
a
review
of
the
validity
of
his
determination
or
of
whether
that
determination
had
a
rational
basis.
it?s
a
completely
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
took
that
position
in
the
district
court
and
we
adhere
to
it
in
the
context
of
the
pervasive
reapportionment
that
was
enacted
here.
the
prior
apportionment
was
repealed
and
the
state
reconsidered
every
district
and
drew
new
district
lines
and
reapportioned
every
one.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
changes
were
very
pervasive
here.
most
districts
had
new
boundary
lines
under
both
the
1971
and
1972
plans
and
many
of
those
who
did
not
have
new
boundary
lines
had
a
different
number
of
representatives.
and
there
was
really
a
change
even
in
the
few
districts
that
had
the
same
boundary
lines,
the
same
number
of
representatives
because
they
were
sending
those
representatives
to
a
state
house
of
representatives
which
would
have
25
fewer
total
members.
so,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
can
really
be
said
that
there
is
no
district
which
remained
unaffected
by
the
reapportionment
legislation
and
we
did
take
the
position
that
the
entire
reapportionment
was
up
for
review.
now,
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
state,
they
say
yes,
there
were
changes
that
were
subject
to
review
under
section
5,
but
that
the
attorney
general?s
objection
is
invalid
because
what
he
objects
to
is
an
aspect
that
really
wasn?t
changed,
and
we
have
two
answers
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
as
we
understand
it,
that?s
a
contention
that
the
objection
is
not
well-founded.
that
the
objection
is
lacking
in
merit
and
under
allen
and
perkins,
congress
has
specified
that
that
question
can
be
litigated
only
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
is
the
contention
that
goes
to
the
merits
and
not
to
rather
--
there
was
a
change
which
had
to
be
submitted
here,
but
we
believe
that
the
objection
is
well-founded.
we
see
no
way
to
administer
the
act
other
than
to
consider
the
implementation,
the
effects
of
the
implementation
of
the
change
and
the
context
in
which
they
will
be
used.
the
act
says
that
if
implementation
of
that
change
will
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race,
then
that
change
should
not
be
implemented.
it
doesn?t
say
that
it
has
to
deny
or
abridge
the
right
to
vote
more
than
it
has
previously
been
denied
or
abridged.
and
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
the
court,
i
think
very
carefully
specified
that
the
pre-implementation
review
was
required
by
congress,
so
that
changes
in
the
election
laws
could
not
be
used
to
perpetuate.
the
word
used
there
was
?perpetuation,?
to
perpetuate
the
discrimination
on
account
of
race
in
voting
in
elections.
and
so
while
we
believe
that
the
matter
is
not
really
before
this
court,
we
think
the
objection
was
well-founded
here.
unless
there
is
no
further
question,
i
think
that
presents
our
case.
