isn’t
there
something
in
the
record
however
that
part
of
their
payments
are
for
educational
purposes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then
what
you’re
saying
is
that
the
educational
increment
is
used
for
general
support?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i
hear
in
your
argument
that
is
the
fact,
that
this
isn’t
an
educational
increment
at
all
despites
its
being
so-called?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
what
in
fact
happened
to
the
children
of
your
petitioners
for
this
past
year,
do
they
ever
receive
textbooks
in
someway?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
ask
the
source
of
their
receipt.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
those
years
ago,
nobody
got
free
textbooks?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
may
be
in
your
day,
but
for
an
old-timer,
not
in
my
day.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
nathanson,
free
glasses
for
the
myopic
child
who
is
nearsighted
and
can’t
see
without.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
but
the
wealthy
--
the
child
of
wealthy
parents
would
have
glasses
supplied.
just
as
here,
the
child
of
the
more
affluent
parent
would
have
these
textbooks
rental
paid.
i'm
asking
in
your
case
whether
your
logic
doesn’t
take
you
to
the
--
and
result
that
the
district
would
have
to
provide
glasses
for
the
indigent
child.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose
it
isn’t?
