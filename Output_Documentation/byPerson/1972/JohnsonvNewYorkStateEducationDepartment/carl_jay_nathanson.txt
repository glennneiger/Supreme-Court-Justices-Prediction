mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
education
has
long
been
a
regarded
as
perhaps
the
most
important
function
about
state
and
local
government.
it’s
recognized
as
fundamental
and
preservative
of
the
democratic
societies.
education
truly
prepares
the
individual
for
meaning
--
meaningful
participation
in
society,
economically,
socially,
politically,
and
intellectually.
new
york
state
like
most
states
in
the
united
states
conceived
education
of
such
fundamental
importance
about
the
individual
and
society
that
it
compels
minors
to
attend
upon
compulsory
instruction
for
a
period
of
10
years.
it’s
against
this
background
that
the
issue
presented
in
this
court
must
be
considered.
new
york’s
public
school
system
continues
to
rely
extensively
upon
textbooks
as
the
basic
core
for
their
curriculum.
it
remains
that
fundamental
tool
in
the
education
of
all
young
students
of
public
schools.
the
question
presented
in
this
court
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbids
new
york
state
from
denying
indigent
school
children,
textbook
essential
for
the
required
instruction
solely
because
of
the
inability
of
their
parents
to
pay
textbook
rental
fees.
in
all
but
six
of
new
york
756
school
districts,
the
statutory
scheme
for
providing
textbooks
is
twofold.
with
respect
to
students
in
grades
seven
to
12,
the
education
law
requires
that
textbooks
be
provided
free
of
charge
to
all
students
in
both
the
public
and
the
private
schools.
with
respect
to
students
in
grades
one
to
six
in
the
public
schools,
the
legislative
scheme
provides
that
the
authorized
voters
of
a
school
district
may
vote
a
tax
for
the
purchase
and
loan
of
textbooks
free
of
charge
to
all
students
in
grades
one
to
six.
however,
in
the
absence
of
such
budget
approval
and
such
approval
of
a
tax
for
that
purpose,
the
local
school
districts
are
required
to
either
rent
or
sell
textbooks
to
all
children
in
grade
one
to
six.
in
june
and
july
of
1970,
the
voters
of
the
west
hempstead
public
school
district
defeated
a
budget
and
a
tax
for
the
purchase
of
textbooks
and
the
distribution
of
textbooks
free
to
children
in
grades
one
to
six.
consequently,
the
local
school
district
notified
all
parents
of
children
in
grades
one
to
six
that
they
would
have
to
pay
a
textbook
rental
fee
as
a
condition
to
their
children
obtaining
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
the
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
school
district
did
in
fact
approve
a
school
budget
and
a
tax
for
the
purchase
of
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
all
students
in
the
elementary
school
are
now
receiving
books.
however,
the
local
school
district
is
under
an
obligation
under
new
york
state
law
to
hold
annual
budget
referendum.
the
preceding
history
of
the
pattern
of
voting
in
this
district
where
six
out
of
seven
school
budgets
have
been
defeated
--
the
fact
that
they
are
--
these
local
school
board
admits
that
absent
approval
of
this
tax,
they
are
mandated
to
rent
or
sell
textbook
to
local
--
to
the
students
in
the
district.
i
think
based
upon
whether
or
not
this
case
is
moot
or
presents
a
justiciable
controversy
and
i
will
cover
that
further
subsequently
in
the
argument.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
parents
of
children
in
the
elementary
school
grades.
they
were
notified,
received
letters;
the
record
bears
it
out
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
school
term
that
no
textbook
would
be
provided
to
children
unless
their
parents
pay
the
textbook
rental
fee.
petitioners
are
also
recipients
of
public
assistance
in
new
york
state
and
were
unable
to
pay
--
were
unable
to
pay
the
textbook
rental
fee.
that
factor
is
uncontroverted
by
the
record
and
there’s
no
question
of
indigency.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
the
--
with
respect
to
that
question,
new
york
state
in
1971
reduced
the
level
of
benefits
for
public
assistance
from
100%
of
need
to
90%
of
need.
at
the
present
time,
recipients
only
receive
90%
to
what
the
state
has
determined
to
be
the
minimum
need
for
sustenance.
so
there’s
no
question
that
even
assuming
there
was
a
minimal
allowance
in
the
budget
for
education,
the
very
fact
that
they
reduced
the
budget
by
that
10%
deprives
the
recipients
of
any
opportunity
to
purchase
the
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes
sir,
the
education
increment
is
used
for
other
items
aside
from
textbooks
will
be
used
for
purchase
of
sneakers
for
gymnasium
classes,
will
be
used
for
purchase
of
gym
suits.
it
would
cover
all
items
related
to
educational
needs.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
with
respect
to
how
the
funds
are
used?
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
there
isn’t,
but
this
question
was
raised
before
the
court
in
the
rosado
case
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
of
the
grant.
i
have
contacted
the
attorney
who
argued
the
case
before
the
court
and
held
the
rosado
case.
i
was
informed
by
that
attorney
that
the
school
--
the
allowance
is
intended
to
cover
all
these
other
items
and
not
intended
to
cover
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
sir.
prior
to
the
commencement
of
this
action,
the
petitioners
through
their
attorney
contacted
the
superintendent
local
school
district
and
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
some
alternative
method
could
be
utilize
to
obtain
textbooks
for
these
indigent
children.
the
superintendent
of
the
school
district
although
compassionate
with
the
plight
of
the
children
indicated
that
he
was
obliged
under
state
law
to
exact
the
textbook
rental
fee
as
a
condition
to
furnishing
textbooks.
the
recipients
also
contacted
to
the
state
and
local
welfare
agency
and
requested
an
allowance
to
cover
the
textbook
rental
fees.
they
were
informed
that
new
york
state
when
it
went
on
to
the
flat
grant
system,
eliminate
all
special
grants
and
any
opportunity
to
provide
for
this
type
of
expenditure.
that
is
born
out
in
the
record
in
the
affidavits
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes
justice
blackmun,
subsequent
in
the
term
five
weeks
after
the
commencement
of
the
school
term
and
after
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
legal
insufficiency.
the
named
plaintiff’s
children
did
receive
textbooks
for
the
balance
of
the
school
term.
they
went
through
five
weeks
of
a
school
term
without
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
there
was
an
arrangement
entered
into
between
counsel
for
the
local
school
board
and
myself
whereby
the
sum
of
$30
was
deposited
by
me
to
be
held
in
escrow
pending
the
resolution
of
the
controversy,
and
the
local
school
board
agreed
to
provide
textbook
to
only
the
named
plaintiff’s
children
without
prejudice
to
maintaining
the
class
action.
i
might
point
out
that
the
local
school
board
in
the
matter
as
it
appeared
in
the
lower
court
conceded
that
there
were
in
fact
other
recipients
in
the
school
district
who
were
similarly
affected
by
this
legislative
scheme.
i’ve
also
attached
as
an
affidavit
to
the
reply
brief
an
affidavit
from
another
recipient
who
is
a
member
of
the
class
and
in
the
second
school
term,
well
again,
went
without
textbooks
for
substantial
period
of
the
school
year.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
true,
in
new
york
state,
textbooks
--
i
come
from
the
city,
the
new
york
city,
textbooks
have
always
been
provided
free,
have
always
been
thought
of
as
a
fundamental
basic
part
of
the
learning
process.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
goes
after
more
than
a
hundred
years
sir.
with
respect
to
the
--
this
action
was
started
as
a
class
action
in
the
district
court
on
september
16,
1970.
the
petition
has
asserted
three
basic
claims
in
the
district
court,
all
alleging
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
petitioner
has
only
press
one
claim
in
this
court
and
that’s
the
poverty
claim.
petitioners
alleged
that
textbooks
are
essential
for
the
education
of
their
children
that
the
failure
to
provide
textbooks
by
the
state
has
denied
an
equal
education
opportunity
and
it’s
further
stigmatized
then.
with
respect
to
the
stigma,
the
affidavit
of
one
of
the
petitioners
as
far
as
to
impress
bears
upon
that.
in
her
affidavit
submitted
in
the
district
court
she
said,
on
the
first
day
of
school,
my
daughter
asked
the
teacher
for
textbooks
and
was
told
that
she
would
have
to
bring
money
from
her
mother
to
obtain
textbooks.
my
daughter
asked
me
upon
her
return
from
school,
why
some
children
at
her
class
were
given
books?
and
i
told
her
that
the
parents
of
those
children
were
able
to
pay
for
the
books.
petitioners
also
alleged
that
children
being
forced
to
attend
school
under
compulsory
education
law
and
then
sit
in
classrooms
along
beside
other
classmates
whose
parents
were
able
to
afford
textbooks
are
subjected
to
further
stigmatizing
by
having
a
feeling
of
inferiority
and
unworthiness
engendered
upon
that
that
the
--
that
what
came
clear
to
this
whole
thing
was
an
official
state
view
of
their
worthiness
or
i
should
say,
unworthiness.
here,
the
classification
creates
two
classes
of
children
in
grades
one
to
six.
the
poor
and
the
non-poor,
the
non-poor
received
the
full
benefits
of
the
states
educational
program
and
the
poor
are
barred
from
receiving
those
benefits.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
but
the
impact
of
this
textbook
rental
fee
is
in
fact
to
deprive
those
children
of
equal
education
opportunity.
the
statute
may
be
neutral
on
its
face,
but
in
operation
it’s
discriminatory.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
that
this
case
satisfies
the
traditional
test
of
dandridge
for
the
following
reasons.
dandridge
said
that
minimally
for
a
classification
of
the
cut
master
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
it’s
got
to
be
rationally
based
and
free
from
invidious
discrimination.
i
think
this
classification
fails
to
satisfy
those
requirements
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
when
considering
the
overall
and
considering
the
rational
basis
for
this
legislation,
i
think
we’ve
got
to
look
at
the
overall
purpose
of
education
in
new
york
state,
which
is
to
provide
a
system
of
common
schools
wherein
all
the
children
of
the
state
may
be
educated.
secondly,
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
fact
that
children
are
attending
school
under
the
compulsion.
when
measured
against
this
overriding
general
purpose
of
the
state,
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
rational
to
deny
poor
children
--
the
very
basic
tools
they
need
to
require
their
learning
skills.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
no.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
fact
that
new
york
state
gives
--
denies
and
it
gives
books
to
those
parents
who
are
able
to
--
to
children
of
parents
who
were
able
to
afford
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
rents
them.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
but
the
impact
upon
those
who
don’t
have
a
rental
fee
is
to
be
denied
equal
education
opportunity.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
the
classification
falls
within
those
line
of
cases
marked
by
griffin.
and
i
think
there
is
really
an
old
force
with
the
griffin
case.
new
york
state
tells
--
the
courts
are
right
of
their
education
to
all
students
of
the
state.
griffin,
the
court
arrived
at
appellate
review.
there’s
no
constitutional
basis
for
either
right,
federal
constitution
basis
may
be
argued.
in
griffin,
the
statute
was
neutral
on
its
face,
those
who
could
afford
the
transcript
fee
attained
adequate
appellate
review.
those
who
couldn’t
were
denied
adequate
appellate
review.
i
think
it’s
parallel
to
this
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
i
don’t
think
the
griffin
rational
has
been
limited
by
this
court
to
only
criminal
law.
i
think
the
rational
of
the
griffin
case
carry
through
in
the
hopper
case.
i
think
the
underlying
rational
of
that
case
with
extended
further
in
the
boddie
case.
i
think
it’s
a
continuous
application
of
that
principle.
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
to
leave,
abandon
that
rational
to
find
any
other
basis
for
deciding
this
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
your
honor,
the
third
cause
of
action
did
seek
declaratory
relief.
i
think
that
it’s
rest
--
it
kept
the
resolution
in
that
framework
that
the
court
can
declare
the
rights
of
those
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
this
court
could
properly
send
the
matter
back
for
the
three-judge
court
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
except
that
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
noted
that
because
of
the
third
cause
of
action
which
sought
declaratory
relief
that
it
wasn’t
essential
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
if
this
court
should
determine
that
jurisdiction
lied
and
the
belief
was
appropriate.
the
relief
could
be
granted
under
the
declaratory
judgment
cause
of
action.
and
that
view
of
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that
would
have
been
for
single
judge.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
the
local
school
board
in
the
state
department
of
education
filed
neither
answer
nor
affidavit
in
the
district
court.
the
local
school
board
filed
the
answering
papers
and
affidavits
and
admitted
for
some
very
key
matters.
first,
they
admitted
that
the
fees
were
demanded.
secondly,
they
admitted
that
--
admitted
that
those
unable
to
pay
the
textbook
rental
fees
were
denied
textbooks.
third,
they
admitted
that
the
fee
policy
placed
a
burden
upon
the
educational
opportunity
of
those
denied
textbooks
and
that
those
children
were
denied
equal
educational
opportunity.
the
board
further
admitted
that
textbooks
in
grades
one
to
six
are
essential
for
the
equality
of
education
of
all
children.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
finding
illegal
insufficiency
without
holding
any
evidentiary
hearing.
there
was
no
opportunity
of
district
court
to
either
explore
the
class
further
or
present
any
further
information.
the
court
of
appeals
again,
affirmed
the
district
court’s
dismissal,
but
nevertheless
conceded
that
education
was
no
doubt
an
area
of
fundamental
importance
that
those
children
who
could
afford
textbooks
no
doubt
received
a
better
education
than
those
who
could
not,
but
concluded
that
the
statute
was
neutral
on
its
face
and
free
from
any
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
actually
there
are
two
parts
of
the
cost.
we
are
only
pressing
the
textbook
fee.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
textbook
fees
were
$7.50
per
child
and
addition
to
the
textbook
fee
there
was
book
--
a
material
fee,
a
fee
for
supplies
and
other
related
items
and
that
was
--
that
total
some
$15.
and
so,
in
all
of
the
fee
with
textbooks
and
that
other
item
ranged
from
$15
to
$17
per
child,
but
we’re
pressing
only
the
claim
of
the
textbooks
has
being
essential
to
education
and
that
being
the
item
that
they
would
--
that
being
basically
protection
challenge.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
mr.
justice
powell
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
the
state
law
distinguishes
between
some
school
districts
on
the
basis
it
applies.
i'm
from
the
new
york
city,
new
york
city
get
that
from
maintaining
textbooks.
children
always
get
textbooks
free
in
the
city.
some
of
the
other
school
districts
--
it
says
district
which
encompass
cities
are
required
under
the
state
law
to
provide
textbooks
in
respect
of
budget
considerations.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we’re
not
pressing
such
claims
in
this
case.
this
case
has
confined
itself
to
whether
or
not
the
local
school
district
can
provide
textbooks
to
those
affluent
--
children
with
affluent
parents
who
can
pay
and
deny
that
essential
tool
of
learning
to
those
who
are
too
poor
to
pay
the
required
fee.
that’s
the
premise
of
this
case
and
we
confine
it
to
that
issue.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
again,
we’re
not
making
that
claim
here,
but
i
would
say
that
with
respect
to
transportation
the
same
argument
can
be
made.
getting
to
school
is
essential
to
any
education
and
if
some
children
are
passed
by
their
door
because
they
don’t
have
the
fee
to
get
into
the
bus,
i
would
say
that
they
should
have
an
equal
protection
claim.
we
passed
into
the
gray
area
and
we
talked
about
clothing,
i
think
that’s
where
we’ve
left
the
rational
of
the
griffin
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
free
lunches
are
basically
handled
under
federal
legislation,
i
don’t
think
i
anticipate
that
that
as
a
problem.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
the
problem
with
the
handicap
child
are
real
problem
and
i
would
say
that
if
the
glasses
are
essential
for
the
child
to
participate
in
the
educational
program
and
if
glasses
are
in
fact
provided
to
other
children
by
the
school
district
than
the
same
rational
would
apply.
we’re
talking,
i
think
about
something
that
being
provided
to
some
children
not
being
provide
to
others.
it’s
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
treat
children
equally.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
that
problem
is
being
addressed
too
by
the
social
services
law.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
necessarily
carry
forth.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
if
the
textbooks
were
required
and
new
york
states
the
textbooks
–
the
textbooks
that
these
children
used
are
part
of
required
course
of
study.
if
the
school
requires
these
textbooks
be
used,
i
think
there’s
an
--
and
children
who
can’t
pay
the
rental
fee
get
them,
i
think
there’s
an
obligation
to
provide
for
those
who
can’t
pay
the
rental
fee.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think,
well,
we
have
state
action
because
it
is
the
school
board
involved
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
if
the
state
were
required
that
these
books
be
used
and
the
children
had
no
way
to
obtain
these
books
because
they
lack
the
fee,
i
think
the
same
rational
would
apply.
again
in
1971,
the
school
district
on
three
occasions
reject
to
the
school
budget.
before
i
discuss
our
--
the
legal
contention
any
further,
i
think
it’s
important
to
consider
two
aspects
of
this
case.
what’s
happened
to
these
poor
children
has
happened
to
them
in
schools
they
are
compelled
to
attend.
secondly,
the
injury
they
have
suffered
is
due
not
to
any
conduct
or
demeanor
on
their
part,
but
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
of
their
status
as
members
of
poor
families.
i
think
the
state
has,
well,
while
we
submit
that
and
we’ve
argued
in
our
brief
that
education
could
qualify
under
the
--
the
more
exacting
standard
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
submit
that
the
purposes
of
determining
this
case
--
the
dandridge
basis
are
sufficient.
again,
that
this
classification
is
neither
rationally
based
nor
free
from
invidious
discrimination.
i
discussed
the
rational
like
a
rational
basis
before
just
deal
with
the
--
what
i
consider
the
invidious
discrimination
here.
first,
the
state
has
stigmatized
poor
children.
i
think
that
it’s
significant
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
although
they
affirmed
the
lower
court
conceded
that
the
plaintiff
had
realistically
described
the
potential
plight
of
these
children
when
they
described
the
psychological
and
emotional
harm
being
engendered
by
being
compelled
to
sit
in
class
with
other
students
who
are
learning
from
textbooks
while
they
don’t
have
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct
justice
marshall.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct
he
also
learns
that
wealth
creates
favorite
treatments
in
the
public
school
which
a
poor
lesson
to
both
rich
and
poor
child
in
the
classroom.
again,
the
further
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
children
are
being
penalized
for
something
of
which
they
have
no
control
just
as
the
child
in
the
levee
case,
and
in
the
weber
case
was
penalized
the
illegitimacy
of
the
condition
of
which
he
had
no
control
hereto,
the
impact
of
this
and
he
admitted
impact
of
this
classification
is
to
deny
equal
education
to
poor
children.
i
think
it’s
significant
that
the
brown
case
which
said
that,
once
the
state
offers
the
opportunity
for
education,
it
must
offer
upon
equal
terms.
it’s
a
right
that
must
be
offered
by
equal
terms
to
all.
i
don’t
think
it’s
being
offered
on
equal
terms
in
this
case.
i
think
the
griffin
case
is
parallel
to
this
case
and
again
the
griffin
case
didn’t
depend
upon
the
court
finding
any
federal
constitutional
right
for
appellate
review.
instead
the
case
was
hinged
upon
the
fact
that
the
state
had
in
fact
provide
appellate
review
and
the
fee
prevented
those
people
who
couldn’t
afford
the
transcript
from
receiving
an
adequate
appellate
review.
i
think
that
very
same
rational
applies
to
this
case.
i
think
there
are
also
the
method
which
the
state
is
going
about
achieving
their
purpose
is
ill-talented
and
poorly
talented
for
the
objective.
i
fail
to
see
how
they
maximize
impact
of
the
textbooks
by
denying
textbooks
to
those
who
perhaps
need
it
most.
it
would
seem
that
a
less
onerous
alternative
would
be
to
deny
textbooks
to
children
in
grades
one
to
12
who
are
able
to
pay
the
textbook
rental
fees.
in
that
case,
all
children
will
be
able
to
obtain
textbooks
in
the
state.
i
think
this
case
is
also
parallels
the
hopper
case.
in
hopper
too,
there
was
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
vote
in
the
state
election.
nevertheless,
the
court
conceives
the
fundamental
interest
involved
--
the
right
to
vote
being
preservative
of
all
the
rights.
i
think
education
is
also
shares
that
place
in
american
society.
it’s
preserved
of
every
other
basic
civil
and
political
right.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
had
based
my
statement
of
footnote
5
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
and
which
the
court
indicated
under
the
circumstances
of
[voice
overlap].
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
declaratory
could’ve
been
appropriate
even
if
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
substantial
claim
would
not
have
to
convene
it.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
thank
you.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
education
has
long
been
a
regarded
as
perhaps
the
most
important
function
about
state
and
local
government.
it’s
recognized
as
fundamental
and
preservative
of
the
democratic
societies.
education
truly
prepares
the
individual
for
meaning
--
meaningful
participation
in
society,
economically,
socially,
politically,
and
intellectually.
new
york
state
like
most
states
in
the
united
states
conceived
education
of
such
fundamental
importance
about
the
individual
and
society
that
it
compels
minors
to
attend
upon
compulsory
instruction
for
a
period
of
10
years.
it’s
against
this
background
that
the
issue
presented
in
this
court
must
be
considered.
new
york’s
public
school
system
continues
to
rely
extensively
upon
textbooks
as
the
basic
core
for
their
curriculum.
it
remains
that
fundamental
tool
in
the
education
of
all
young
students
of
public
schools.
the
question
presented
in
this
court
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbids
new
york
state
from
denying
indigent
school
children,
textbook
essential
for
the
required
instruction
solely
because
of
the
inability
of
their
parents
to
pay
textbook
rental
fees.
in
all
but
six
of
new
york
756
school
districts,
the
statutory
scheme
for
providing
textbooks
is
twofold.
with
respect
to
students
in
grades
seven
to
12,
the
education
law
requires
that
textbooks
be
provided
free
of
charge
to
all
students
in
both
the
public
and
the
private
schools.
with
respect
to
students
in
grades
one
to
six
in
the
public
schools,
the
legislative
scheme
provides
that
the
authorized
voters
of
a
school
district
may
vote
a
tax
for
the
purchase
and
loan
of
textbooks
free
of
charge
to
all
students
in
grades
one
to
six.
however,
in
the
absence
of
such
budget
approval
and
such
approval
of
a
tax
for
that
purpose,
the
local
school
districts
are
required
to
either
rent
or
sell
textbooks
to
all
children
in
grade
one
to
six.
in
june
and
july
of
1970,
the
voters
of
the
west
hempstead
public
school
district
defeated
a
budget
and
a
tax
for
the
purchase
of
textbooks
and
the
distribution
of
textbooks
free
to
children
in
grades
one
to
six.
consequently,
the
local
school
district
notified
all
parents
of
children
in
grades
one
to
six
that
they
would
have
to
pay
a
textbook
rental
fee
as
a
condition
to
their
children
obtaining
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
the
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
school
district
did
in
fact
approve
a
school
budget
and
a
tax
for
the
purchase
of
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
all
students
in
the
elementary
school
are
now
receiving
books.
however,
the
local
school
district
is
under
an
obligation
under
new
york
state
law
to
hold
annual
budget
referendum.
the
preceding
history
of
the
pattern
of
voting
in
this
district
where
six
out
of
seven
school
budgets
have
been
defeated
--
the
fact
that
they
are
--
these
local
school
board
admits
that
absent
approval
of
this
tax,
they
are
mandated
to
rent
or
sell
textbook
to
local
--
to
the
students
in
the
district.
i
think
based
upon
whether
or
not
this
case
is
moot
or
presents
a
justiciable
controversy
and
i
will
cover
that
further
subsequently
in
the
argument.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
parents
of
children
in
the
elementary
school
grades.
they
were
notified,
received
letters;
the
record
bears
it
out
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
school
term
that
no
textbook
would
be
provided
to
children
unless
their
parents
pay
the
textbook
rental
fee.
petitioners
are
also
recipients
of
public
assistance
in
new
york
state
and
were
unable
to
pay
--
were
unable
to
pay
the
textbook
rental
fee.
that
factor
is
uncontroverted
by
the
record
and
there’s
no
question
of
indigency.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
the
--
with
respect
to
that
question,
new
york
state
in
1971
reduced
the
level
of
benefits
for
public
assistance
from
100%
of
need
to
90%
of
need.
at
the
present
time,
recipients
only
receive
90%
to
what
the
state
has
determined
to
be
the
minimum
need
for
sustenance.
so
there’s
no
question
that
even
assuming
there
was
a
minimal
allowance
in
the
budget
for
education,
the
very
fact
that
they
reduced
the
budget
by
that
10%
deprives
the
recipients
of
any
opportunity
to
purchase
the
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes
sir,
the
education
increment
is
used
for
other
items
aside
from
textbooks
will
be
used
for
purchase
of
sneakers
for
gymnasium
classes,
will
be
used
for
purchase
of
gym
suits.
it
would
cover
all
items
related
to
educational
needs.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
with
respect
to
how
the
funds
are
used?
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
there
isn’t,
but
this
question
was
raised
before
the
court
in
the
rosado
case
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
of
the
grant.
i
have
contacted
the
attorney
who
argued
the
case
before
the
court
and
held
the
rosado
case.
i
was
informed
by
that
attorney
that
the
school
--
the
allowance
is
intended
to
cover
all
these
other
items
and
not
intended
to
cover
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
sir.
prior
to
the
commencement
of
this
action,
the
petitioners
through
their
attorney
contacted
the
superintendent
local
school
district
and
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
some
alternative
method
could
be
utilize
to
obtain
textbooks
for
these
indigent
children.
the
superintendent
of
the
school
district
although
compassionate
with
the
plight
of
the
children
indicated
that
he
was
obliged
under
state
law
to
exact
the
textbook
rental
fee
as
a
condition
to
furnishing
textbooks.
the
recipients
also
contacted
to
the
state
and
local
welfare
agency
and
requested
an
allowance
to
cover
the
textbook
rental
fees.
they
were
informed
that
new
york
state
when
it
went
on
to
the
flat
grant
system,
eliminate
all
special
grants
and
any
opportunity
to
provide
for
this
type
of
expenditure.
that
is
born
out
in
the
record
in
the
affidavits
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes
justice
blackmun,
subsequent
in
the
term
five
weeks
after
the
commencement
of
the
school
term
and
after
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
legal
insufficiency.
the
named
plaintiff’s
children
did
receive
textbooks
for
the
balance
of
the
school
term.
they
went
through
five
weeks
of
a
school
term
without
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
there
was
an
arrangement
entered
into
between
counsel
for
the
local
school
board
and
myself
whereby
the
sum
of
$30
was
deposited
by
me
to
be
held
in
escrow
pending
the
resolution
of
the
controversy,
and
the
local
school
board
agreed
to
provide
textbook
to
only
the
named
plaintiff’s
children
without
prejudice
to
maintaining
the
class
action.
i
might
point
out
that
the
local
school
board
in
the
matter
as
it
appeared
in
the
lower
court
conceded
that
there
were
in
fact
other
recipients
in
the
school
district
who
were
similarly
affected
by
this
legislative
scheme.
i’ve
also
attached
as
an
affidavit
to
the
reply
brief
an
affidavit
from
another
recipient
who
is
a
member
of
the
class
and
in
the
second
school
term,
well
again,
went
without
textbooks
for
substantial
period
of
the
school
year.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
true,
in
new
york
state,
textbooks
--
i
come
from
the
city,
the
new
york
city,
textbooks
have
always
been
provided
free,
have
always
been
thought
of
as
a
fundamental
basic
part
of
the
learning
process.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
goes
after
more
than
a
hundred
years
sir.
with
respect
to
the
--
this
action
was
started
as
a
class
action
in
the
district
court
on
september
16,
1970.
the
petition
has
asserted
three
basic
claims
in
the
district
court,
all
alleging
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
petitioner
has
only
press
one
claim
in
this
court
and
that’s
the
poverty
claim.
petitioners
alleged
that
textbooks
are
essential
for
the
education
of
their
children
that
the
failure
to
provide
textbooks
by
the
state
has
denied
an
equal
education
opportunity
and
it’s
further
stigmatized
then.
with
respect
to
the
stigma,
the
affidavit
of
one
of
the
petitioners
as
far
as
to
impress
bears
upon
that.
in
her
affidavit
submitted
in
the
district
court
she
said,
on
the
first
day
of
school,
my
daughter
asked
the
teacher
for
textbooks
and
was
told
that
she
would
have
to
bring
money
from
her
mother
to
obtain
textbooks.
my
daughter
asked
me
upon
her
return
from
school,
why
some
children
at
her
class
were
given
books?
and
i
told
her
that
the
parents
of
those
children
were
able
to
pay
for
the
books.
petitioners
also
alleged
that
children
being
forced
to
attend
school
under
compulsory
education
law
and
then
sit
in
classrooms
along
beside
other
classmates
whose
parents
were
able
to
afford
textbooks
are
subjected
to
further
stigmatizing
by
having
a
feeling
of
inferiority
and
unworthiness
engendered
upon
that
that
the
--
that
what
came
clear
to
this
whole
thing
was
an
official
state
view
of
their
worthiness
or
i
should
say,
unworthiness.
here,
the
classification
creates
two
classes
of
children
in
grades
one
to
six.
the
poor
and
the
non-poor,
the
non-poor
received
the
full
benefits
of
the
states
educational
program
and
the
poor
are
barred
from
receiving
those
benefits.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
but
the
impact
of
this
textbook
rental
fee
is
in
fact
to
deprive
those
children
of
equal
education
opportunity.
the
statute
may
be
neutral
on
its
face,
but
in
operation
it’s
discriminatory.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
that
this
case
satisfies
the
traditional
test
of
dandridge
for
the
following
reasons.
dandridge
said
that
minimally
for
a
classification
of
the
cut
master
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
it’s
got
to
be
rationally
based
and
free
from
invidious
discrimination.
i
think
this
classification
fails
to
satisfy
those
requirements
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
when
considering
the
overall
and
considering
the
rational
basis
for
this
legislation,
i
think
we’ve
got
to
look
at
the
overall
purpose
of
education
in
new
york
state,
which
is
to
provide
a
system
of
common
schools
wherein
all
the
children
of
the
state
may
be
educated.
secondly,
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
fact
that
children
are
attending
school
under
the
compulsion.
when
measured
against
this
overriding
general
purpose
of
the
state,
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
rational
to
deny
poor
children
--
the
very
basic
tools
they
need
to
require
their
learning
skills.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
no.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
fact
that
new
york
state
gives
--
denies
and
it
gives
books
to
those
parents
who
are
able
to
--
to
children
of
parents
who
were
able
to
afford
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
rents
them.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
but
the
impact
upon
those
who
don’t
have
a
rental
fee
is
to
be
denied
equal
education
opportunity.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
the
classification
falls
within
those
line
of
cases
marked
by
griffin.
and
i
think
there
is
really
an
old
force
with
the
griffin
case.
new
york
state
tells
--
the
courts
are
right
of
their
education
to
all
students
of
the
state.
griffin,
the
court
arrived
at
appellate
review.
there’s
no
constitutional
basis
for
either
right,
federal
constitution
basis
may
be
argued.
in
griffin,
the
statute
was
neutral
on
its
face,
those
who
could
afford
the
transcript
fee
attained
adequate
appellate
review.
those
who
couldn’t
were
denied
adequate
appellate
review.
i
think
it’s
parallel
to
this
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
i
don’t
think
the
griffin
rational
has
been
limited
by
this
court
to
only
criminal
law.
i
think
the
rational
of
the
griffin
case
carry
through
in
the
hopper
case.
i
think
the
underlying
rational
of
that
case
with
extended
further
in
the
boddie
case.
i
think
it’s
a
continuous
application
of
that
principle.
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
to
leave,
abandon
that
rational
to
find
any
other
basis
for
deciding
this
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
your
honor,
the
third
cause
of
action
did
seek
declaratory
relief.
i
think
that
it’s
rest
--
it
kept
the
resolution
in
that
framework
that
the
court
can
declare
the
rights
of
those
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
this
court
could
properly
send
the
matter
back
for
the
three-judge
court
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
except
that
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
noted
that
because
of
the
third
cause
of
action
which
sought
declaratory
relief
that
it
wasn’t
essential
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
if
this
court
should
determine
that
jurisdiction
lied
and
the
belief
was
appropriate.
the
relief
could
be
granted
under
the
declaratory
judgment
cause
of
action.
and
that
view
of
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that
would
have
been
for
single
judge.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
the
local
school
board
in
the
state
department
of
education
filed
neither
answer
nor
affidavit
in
the
district
court.
the
local
school
board
filed
the
answering
papers
and
affidavits
and
admitted
for
some
very
key
matters.
first,
they
admitted
that
the
fees
were
demanded.
secondly,
they
admitted
that
--
admitted
that
those
unable
to
pay
the
textbook
rental
fees
were
denied
textbooks.
third,
they
admitted
that
the
fee
policy
placed
a
burden
upon
the
educational
opportunity
of
those
denied
textbooks
and
that
those
children
were
denied
equal
educational
opportunity.
the
board
further
admitted
that
textbooks
in
grades
one
to
six
are
essential
for
the
equality
of
education
of
all
children.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
finding
illegal
insufficiency
without
holding
any
evidentiary
hearing.
there
was
no
opportunity
of
district
court
to
either
explore
the
class
further
or
present
any
further
information.
the
court
of
appeals
again,
affirmed
the
district
court’s
dismissal,
but
nevertheless
conceded
that
education
was
no
doubt
an
area
of
fundamental
importance
that
those
children
who
could
afford
textbooks
no
doubt
received
a
better
education
than
those
who
could
not,
but
concluded
that
the
statute
was
neutral
on
its
face
and
free
from
any
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
actually
there
are
two
parts
of
the
cost.
we
are
only
pressing
the
textbook
fee.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
textbook
fees
were
$7.50
per
child
and
addition
to
the
textbook
fee
there
was
book
--
a
material
fee,
a
fee
for
supplies
and
other
related
items
and
that
was
--
that
total
some
$15.
and
so,
in
all
of
the
fee
with
textbooks
and
that
other
item
ranged
from
$15
to
$17
per
child,
but
we’re
pressing
only
the
claim
of
the
textbooks
has
being
essential
to
education
and
that
being
the
item
that
they
would
--
that
being
basically
protection
challenge.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
mr.
justice
powell
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
the
state
law
distinguishes
between
some
school
districts
on
the
basis
it
applies.
i'm
from
the
new
york
city,
new
york
city
get
that
from
maintaining
textbooks.
children
always
get
textbooks
free
in
the
city.
some
of
the
other
school
districts
--
it
says
district
which
encompass
cities
are
required
under
the
state
law
to
provide
textbooks
in
respect
of
budget
considerations.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we’re
not
pressing
such
claims
in
this
case.
this
case
has
confined
itself
to
whether
or
not
the
local
school
district
can
provide
textbooks
to
those
affluent
--
children
with
affluent
parents
who
can
pay
and
deny
that
essential
tool
of
learning
to
those
who
are
too
poor
to
pay
the
required
fee.
that’s
the
premise
of
this
case
and
we
confine
it
to
that
issue.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
again,
we’re
not
making
that
claim
here,
but
i
would
say
that
with
respect
to
transportation
the
same
argument
can
be
made.
getting
to
school
is
essential
to
any
education
and
if
some
children
are
passed
by
their
door
because
they
don’t
have
the
fee
to
get
into
the
bus,
i
would
say
that
they
should
have
an
equal
protection
claim.
we
passed
into
the
gray
area
and
we
talked
about
clothing,
i
think
that’s
where
we’ve
left
the
rational
of
the
griffin
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
free
lunches
are
basically
handled
under
federal
legislation,
i
don’t
think
i
anticipate
that
that
as
a
problem.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
the
problem
with
the
handicap
child
are
real
problem
and
i
would
say
that
if
the
glasses
are
essential
for
the
child
to
participate
in
the
educational
program
and
if
glasses
are
in
fact
provided
to
other
children
by
the
school
district
than
the
same
rational
would
apply.
we’re
talking,
i
think
about
something
that
being
provided
to
some
children
not
being
provide
to
others.
it’s
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
treat
children
equally.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
that
problem
is
being
addressed
too
by
the
social
services
law.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
necessarily
carry
forth.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
if
the
textbooks
were
required
and
new
york
states
the
textbooks
–
the
textbooks
that
these
children
used
are
part
of
required
course
of
study.
if
the
school
requires
these
textbooks
be
used,
i
think
there’s
an
--
and
children
who
can’t
pay
the
rental
fee
get
them,
i
think
there’s
an
obligation
to
provide
for
those
who
can’t
pay
the
rental
fee.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think,
well,
we
have
state
action
because
it
is
the
school
board
involved
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
if
the
state
were
required
that
these
books
be
used
and
the
children
had
no
way
to
obtain
these
books
because
they
lack
the
fee,
i
think
the
same
rational
would
apply.
again
in
1971,
the
school
district
on
three
occasions
reject
to
the
school
budget.
before
i
discuss
our
--
the
legal
contention
any
further,
i
think
it’s
important
to
consider
two
aspects
of
this
case.
what’s
happened
to
these
poor
children
has
happened
to
them
in
schools
they
are
compelled
to
attend.
secondly,
the
injury
they
have
suffered
is
due
not
to
any
conduct
or
demeanor
on
their
part,
but
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
of
their
status
as
members
of
poor
families.
i
think
the
state
has,
well,
while
we
submit
that
and
we’ve
argued
in
our
brief
that
education
could
qualify
under
the
--
the
more
exacting
standard
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
submit
that
the
purposes
of
determining
this
case
--
the
dandridge
basis
are
sufficient.
again,
that
this
classification
is
neither
rationally
based
nor
free
from
invidious
discrimination.
i
discussed
the
rational
like
a
rational
basis
before
just
deal
with
the
--
what
i
consider
the
invidious
discrimination
here.
first,
the
state
has
stigmatized
poor
children.
i
think
that
it’s
significant
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
although
they
affirmed
the
lower
court
conceded
that
the
plaintiff
had
realistically
described
the
potential
plight
of
these
children
when
they
described
the
psychological
and
emotional
harm
being
engendered
by
being
compelled
to
sit
in
class
with
other
students
who
are
learning
from
textbooks
while
they
don’t
have
textbooks.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct
justice
marshall.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct
he
also
learns
that
wealth
creates
favorite
treatments
in
the
public
school
which
a
poor
lesson
to
both
rich
and
poor
child
in
the
classroom.
again,
the
further
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
children
are
being
penalized
for
something
of
which
they
have
no
control
just
as
the
child
in
the
levee
case,
and
in
the
weber
case
was
penalized
the
illegitimacy
of
the
condition
of
which
he
had
no
control
hereto,
the
impact
of
this
and
he
admitted
impact
of
this
classification
is
to
deny
equal
education
to
poor
children.
i
think
it’s
significant
that
the
brown
case
which
said
that,
once
the
state
offers
the
opportunity
for
education,
it
must
offer
upon
equal
terms.
it’s
a
right
that
must
be
offered
by
equal
terms
to
all.
i
don’t
think
it’s
being
offered
on
equal
terms
in
this
case.
i
think
the
griffin
case
is
parallel
to
this
case
and
again
the
griffin
case
didn’t
depend
upon
the
court
finding
any
federal
constitutional
right
for
appellate
review.
instead
the
case
was
hinged
upon
the
fact
that
the
state
had
in
fact
provide
appellate
review
and
the
fee
prevented
those
people
who
couldn’t
afford
the
transcript
from
receiving
an
adequate
appellate
review.
i
think
that
very
same
rational
applies
to
this
case.
i
think
there
are
also
the
method
which
the
state
is
going
about
achieving
their
purpose
is
ill-talented
and
poorly
talented
for
the
objective.
i
fail
to
see
how
they
maximize
impact
of
the
textbooks
by
denying
textbooks
to
those
who
perhaps
need
it
most.
it
would
seem
that
a
less
onerous
alternative
would
be
to
deny
textbooks
to
children
in
grades
one
to
12
who
are
able
to
pay
the
textbook
rental
fees.
in
that
case,
all
children
will
be
able
to
obtain
textbooks
in
the
state.
i
think
this
case
is
also
parallels
the
hopper
case.
in
hopper
too,
there
was
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
vote
in
the
state
election.
nevertheless,
the
court
conceives
the
fundamental
interest
involved
--
the
right
to
vote
being
preservative
of
all
the
rights.
i
think
education
is
also
shares
that
place
in
american
society.
it’s
preserved
of
every
other
basic
civil
and
political
right.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
had
based
my
statement
of
footnote
5
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
and
which
the
court
indicated
under
the
circumstances
of
[voice
overlap].
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
declaratory
could’ve
been
appropriate
even
if
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
substantial
claim
would
not
have
to
convene
it.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
thank
you.
