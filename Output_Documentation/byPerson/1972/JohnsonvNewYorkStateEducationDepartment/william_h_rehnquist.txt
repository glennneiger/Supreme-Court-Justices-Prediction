justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
indicate
the
type
of
use
that
you
have
just
spoken
on
mr.
nathanson?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that’s
not
in
the
record
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
doesn’t
create
that
classification.
those
classes
exist
quite
apart
from
the
statute,
don’t
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish
your
case
from
the
general
doctrine
laid
down
in
dandridge
against
williams?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you’re
talking
about
the
classification.
you’re
not
talking
about
the
distinction
between
elementary
school
children
and
children
further
along
in
school
than
they
require?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
--
so,
just
what
is
the
classification
that
you’re
talking
about?
the
fact
that
new
york
doesn’t
give
anybody
free
books
from
grades
one
to
six?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
sells
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rents
them,
it
doesn’t
give
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
classification
though
really
is
almost
non-existent
as
i
would
see
it.
new
york
state
says
to
children
in
the
elementary
school
grade,
we
will
rent
you
books
and
that
that
isn’t
a
classification
in
any
orthodox
of
equal
protection
sense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
say
basically
that
the
rational
of
griffin
should
be
carried
over
from
the
field
of
criminal
law
and
to
this
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you’re
arguing
about
the
term
(inaudible)
it’s
the
school
board
itself
which
rents
the
textbook,
wouldn’t
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
school
board
said,
here’s
a
list
of
books
you
have
to
have.
now,
you
can
go
down
to
joe’s
bookstore
and
rent
them
if
you
got
the
money.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn’t
turn
on
the
fact
that
the
running
agency
happen
to
be
the
state
here
or
the
school
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
action
is
the
requirement,
isn’t
it
that
books
be
used
for
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nathanson,
can
you
enlighten
me.
supposing
that
you
would
simply
sought
declaratory
relief
in
the
district
court
for
what
was
the
eastern
district
and
not
sought
an
injunction
regardless
of
judge
travia’s
opinion
as
to
the
substantiality
of
the
constitutional
claim,
would
that
have
required
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn’t
think
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewittes,
i
understood
mr.
nathanson
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
brennan
to
say
that
the
second
circuit
here
at
least
relied
on
an
alternative
theory
for
not
convening
a
three-judge
court.
that
is
that
what
ever
the
--
even
conceding
that
the
constitutional
question
might
have
been
substantial,
the
probability
of
an
injunctive
relief
was
virtually
non-existent
and
therefore
even
if
the
plaintiffs
have
prevailed
in
their
constitutional
claim.
the
most
they
would
have
gotten
is
a
declaratory
judgment
and
under
those
circumstances
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
convene
a
three-judge
court.
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with

rehnquist
