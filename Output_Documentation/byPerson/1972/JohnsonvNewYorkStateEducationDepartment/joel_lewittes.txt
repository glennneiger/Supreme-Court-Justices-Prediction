mr.
joel
lewittes
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
i
would.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
initially
very
like
analyze
these
two
statutes.
i'm
trying
to
place
this
case
if
i
may
in
its
proper
perspective.
the
two
statutes
are
section
701
of
the
new
york
education
law
and
that
deals
with
the
provision
the
furnishing
textbooks
from
grade
seven
through
12
and
which
allows
the
local
school
board
to
pay
up
to
$10
per
book,
per
child
for
the
school
year.
that’s
$10,
that
the
outside
limit
they
may
spend
in
grade
seven
through
12.
section
703
dealing
with
the
primary
grades
one
through
six
speaks
some
terms
of
qualified
voters
of
any
school
district
may
vote
of
tax
for
textbooks.
if
they
do
not,
if
they
are
under
the
austerity
program,
then
they
may
charge
a
rental
fee
per
year
of
$7.50
per
child.
now,
this
provision
under
703
does
not
implicate
the
heavy
areas
--
the
urban
areas
in
new
york
state
because
of
provisions
there
do
allow
the
local
school
boards
to
provide
textbooks
without
a
referendum
and
authorize
them
and
so
to
do.
it’s
note
worthy
as
well
that
in
these
large
urban
areas,
new
york
city
and
we
have
set
them
forth
which
they
are
buffalo
and
rochester,
syracuse
and
yonkers.
its
note
worthy
that
these
are
concentrated
areas
of
welfares.
so
that’s
it’s
not
quite
justified
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
here
to
claim
that
state
of
new
york
is
discriminating
against
indigent
welfare
recipients.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
large
percentage
of
the
welfare
recipients
do
reside
in
these
urban
areas
and
all
beneficiaries
of
the
state’s
statutes
that
do
permit
school
textbooks
to
be
distributed
without
any
charge
of
rental
fee.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
they
are.
i’m
just
--
if
i
may
justice
marshall,
i’m
simply
trying
to
place
this
case
in
its
perspective.
i
think
it’s
getting
a
little
out
of
hand.
now,
the
$7.50
rental
fee
per
year
in
grades
one
through
six
can
actually
be
deemed
a
reasonable
rate
in
light
of
the
$10
limit
that
supplied
in
grade
seven
through
12
under
section
701.
and
because
of
declaration
of
policy
in
state
of
new
york
with
regard
to
grade
seven
through
12
is
that
because
of
the
added
cost
of
the
textbooks
and
the
technical
nature
of
the
textbooks.
this
heavy
burden
should
not
be
passed
on
to
any
of
the
children
and
the
state
has
formulated
that
declaration
of
policy
in
that
statute
itself.
now,
the
$7.50
figure
is
a
reasonable
rate
when
we
look
at
the
$10
rate
in
section
701.
now,
in
new
york
state
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
of
rosado
against
wyman,
there
were
special
need
grants
for
afdc
or
aid
for
dependent
children
recipients
included.
there
was
included
an
item
for
textbooks
in
these
special
need
grants.
this
court
in
rosado
determined
that
the
state
of
new
york
may
not
sole
proceed
with
specialty
grants.
there
must
a
flat
general
grant
and
following
this
court’s
dictates,
new
york
social
services
law
was
amended
to
reach
so
that
section
131-a
does
eliminate
all
special
grants
excluding
rent
in
fuel,
but
includes
textbooks
and
related
education
expenses
under
the
general
grant
and
the
record
shows
and
it
is
just
been
conceded
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
that
when
the
rosado
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
determined
that
approximately
$3
is
included
in
the
monthly
grant
for
all
educational
expenses
for
the
family
of
four.
so
that
amounts
to
$36
a
year
per
family
of
four.
assuming
that
the
10%
reduction
goes
--
is
involved
here
then
that
would
be
$32.40
per
year
for
educational
expenses.
now,
we’ve
just
noted
that
the
rental
fee
is
$7.50.
so
that
it
is
note
worthy
that
it
is
not
unjustifiable
rental
fee
and
that
these
plaintiffs
--
these
petitioners
can
afford
this
assuming
that
they
budget
the
welfare
grants
properly.
mr.
joel
lewittes
those
poor
people
are
not
in
the
class.
i
understand
that
this
alleged
class
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
assume
they
obviously
they
are
not
recipients
of
welfare
and
therefore
would
not
be
getting
this
$7.50
and
this
$36.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
technically
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
think
that
we
could
conclude,
could
we
not
that
the
state
legislature
when
it
passed
this
law
which
was
passed
in
1965
may
have
very
well
taken
into
light
the
welfare
of
the
social
service
law
and
in
so
doing
felt
that
it,
it
would
cover
the
educational
cause,
but
then
it
would
not
the
welfare
statute
would
not
cover
the
educational
cause
when
you
got
to
the
higher
grades
because
of
the
heavier
cost
of
textbooks,
therefore
the
difference
between
701
and
703.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
you
see
it’s
quite
clear
is
it
not
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
yes,
but
it’s
quite
clear,
is
it
not
that
the
state
of
new
york
really
never
has
been
in
business
of
loaning
textbook
or
selling
textbook.
may
i
also
note
by
the
way
that
the
educational
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
now,
we
have
a
companion
and
there
are
at
least
15
to
20
states
that
have
this
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
the
educational
expenses
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
justice
marshall
there
are
theories
and
education
today
as
they
tell
me
that
children
maybe
educated
without
books
as
a
matter
of
facts
some
of
theories
claim
that
these
textbooks
are
not
at
all
helpful
that
they
are
doing
a
way
with
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
believe
it
is
mentioned
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
think
this
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
yes,
but
they
do
not
say
that
it
is
because
of
textbooks
that
he
knows
how
to
read.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i’m
saying
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
the
state
of
new
york,
statutes
does
not
require
the
textbooks.
mr.
joel
lewittes
they
have
an
approved
list
of
textbooks,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
am
not
saying,
i
think
the
question
was
asked
to
me
is
whether
or
not
its
essential
--
the
textbooks
be
use
in
educational
my
answer
was
that
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessarily
true
that
i
concede
that
because
there
are
theories
in
education
circles
today.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
the
state
of
new
york
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i’m
not
that
familiar
with
these
theories.
it
was
noted
by
the
way
in
the
circuit
court
dissenting
opinion.
there
are
theories
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
pardon?
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
i’m
just
trying
to
answer
your
question
when
you
asked
me
i
believe
whether
or
not
one
can
be
educated
without
textbooks
and
i’m
answering
that
there
are
theories
that
yes.
the
answer
is
yes,
if
you
are
asking
me
whether
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
of
new
york
textbooks
are
involved
in
the
educational
process,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
think
at
this
modern
age
today
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
can
say
there
were
the
visual
aids
and
the
new
developments
and
education
that
make
possible.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
they
probably
do
have
visual
aid
in
this
county,
but
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
the
thing
that
is
certain
is
that
the
kids
do
have
books.
kids
do
have
books
--
the
school
budget
was
voted
and
they
have
books
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
it
may
be
change
next
year,
but
let
me
say
this
justice
marshall,
if
i
may,
that
it
has
been
determined
that
books
are
useable
for
five
years.
books
are
usable
for
five
years.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
it
could,
but
i
think
that
history
of
school
district
is
a
matter
of
fact.
it’s
been
alleged
throughout
that
there
were
three
votes
that
voted
down
the
budgets.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there’s
a
one
school
year
that
they
voted
down
the
budget
prior
to
that
they’ve
always
voted
before
the
budget.
i
think
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
because
of
the
welfare
and
because
these
are
welfare
children
that
are
bringing
this.
i
think
the
welfare
grants
still
cover
this.
in
the
alternative,
i
think
we
could
argue
and
i’m
saying
the
alternative
because
dandridge
talks
in
terms
of
allocation
of
financial
resources.
i
think
we’ve
been
more
than
allocated,
we
covered
them,
but
in
our
own
we
do
have.
new
york
state
does
have
finite
budget
and
this
is
a
welfare
case.
as
much
as
they
would
like
to
construct
this
to
be
one
of
fundamental
liberty,
it’s
not
fundamental
liberty.
they
are
not
arguing
that’s
really
fundamental
liberty
because
fundamental
liberty
would
mean
that
these
textbooks
would
be
available
to
all
the
students
whether
they
are
rich
or
poor.
they
don’t
say
that
here,
they
say
that
we
should
provide
textbooks
for
indigents.
if
it’s
a
fundamental
liberty
they
should
be
arguing
should
(inaudible)
at
all.
the
fact
of
the
matter
it’s
not
a
fundamental
liberty.
it’s
not
a
question
of
fundamental
liberty
involved
here
because
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
reach
the
issue.
i
think
it’s
a
one
of
the
welfare
case
and
the
socially
economic
cases
under
dandridge
and
that
we
have
reasonably
handled
this
problem
with
our
statute
at
701
with
the
grades
seven
through
12
and
703
one
through
six,
which
is
the
most
important
accouchement
of
an
education.
i
don’t
think
the
state
of
new
york
can
thus,
it
has
decided
this
and
should
be
held
to
decide
of
the
school
lunch
program
is
a
very
important
fact
and
no
doubt
in
briggs
against
kerrigan
in
the
first
circuit
they
held
that
they
could
restrict
school
lunch
programs
is
secondary
schools
even
though
that
fell
heavily
upon
indigent
students
that
could
not
afford
the
lunches.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
frankly
justice
marshall
cannot
answer
that.
i
would
say
for
at
least
50
years.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
one
before
i
close.
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
question
with
justice
brennan’s
question.
yes,
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
a
three-judge
court
was
improperly
was
denied
and
that
is
the
sole
issue
here.
of
course,
the
merits
have
to
be
considered,
but
have
they
raised
a
substantial
federal
constitutional
question?
and
this
court
in
the
california
water
service
case
against
redding
has
set
forth
to
test
whether
or
not
if
the
case
is
obviously
without
merit
or
whether
it
has
been
foreclosed
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
i
think
that
it’s
possible
that
it
has
been
foreclosed
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
i
think
in
dandridge
is
the
case
that
we
can
stand
on.
i
think
the
language
in
jefferson
against
hackney
as
well.
i
think
that
if
they
seek
to
attack
the
fact
that
there
is
a
voter
referendum
here,
i
think
james
against
valtierra
covers
that.
so,
i
think
that
it’s
clear
that
using
either
the
test
of
the
unsoundness
or
whether
it
has
been
foreclosed
by
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think
that
three-judge
court
was
properly
denied
below.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
it
is.
mr.
joel
lewittes
exactly.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
no,
no.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that’s
what
they
said
in
the
footnote
with
regard
to
that
astro
cinema
corporation,
but
i
think
the
reading
of
the
decision
here
in
the
second
circuit
shows
clearly
that
they
use
the
traditional
test
as
to
whether
or
not
a
substantial
federal
[voice
overlap].
mr.
joel
lewittes
exactly.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
believe
sir.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
we
have,
but
we
do
urge
that
and
i’ve
also
added
the
significant
fact
of
that
because
these
books
are
useable
for
five
years
that
even
it’s
not
in
the
realm
of
clear
probability
that
we’re
going
to
have
this
problem
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
certainly
that
it
won’t
become
obsolete
within
one
year.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that’s
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
pay
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
they
pay
one
rental
for
fee
per
year,
but
the
rental
fee
is
only
paid
in
case
an
austerity
budget
is
voted.
mr.
joel
lewittes
exactly,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
joel
lewittes
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
i
would.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
initially
very
like
analyze
these
two
statutes.
i'm
trying
to
place
this
case
if
i
may
in
its
proper
perspective.
the
two
statutes
are
section
701
of
the
new
york
education
law
and
that
deals
with
the
provision
the
furnishing
textbooks
from
grade
seven
through
12
and
which
allows
the
local
school
board
to
pay
up
to
$10
per
book,
per
child
for
the
school
year.
that’s
$10,
that
the
outside
limit
they
may
spend
in
grade
seven
through
12.
section
703
dealing
with
the
primary
grades
one
through
six
speaks
some
terms
of
qualified
voters
of
any
school
district
may
vote
of
tax
for
textbooks.
if
they
do
not,
if
they
are
under
the
austerity
program,
then
they
may
charge
a
rental
fee
per
year
of
$7.50
per
child.
now,
this
provision
under
703
does
not
implicate
the
heavy
areas
--
the
urban
areas
in
new
york
state
because
of
provisions
there
do
allow
the
local
school
boards
to
provide
textbooks
without
a
referendum
and
authorize
them
and
so
to
do.
it’s
note
worthy
as
well
that
in
these
large
urban
areas,
new
york
city
and
we
have
set
them
forth
which
they
are
buffalo
and
rochester,
syracuse
and
yonkers.
its
note
worthy
that
these
are
concentrated
areas
of
welfares.
so
that’s
it’s
not
quite
justified
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
here
to
claim
that
state
of
new
york
is
discriminating
against
indigent
welfare
recipients.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
large
percentage
of
the
welfare
recipients
do
reside
in
these
urban
areas
and
all
beneficiaries
of
the
state’s
statutes
that
do
permit
school
textbooks
to
be
distributed
without
any
charge
of
rental
fee.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
they
are.
i’m
just
--
if
i
may
justice
marshall,
i’m
simply
trying
to
place
this
case
in
its
perspective.
i
think
it’s
getting
a
little
out
of
hand.
now,
the
$7.50
rental
fee
per
year
in
grades
one
through
six
can
actually
be
deemed
a
reasonable
rate
in
light
of
the
$10
limit
that
supplied
in
grade
seven
through
12
under
section
701.
and
because
of
declaration
of
policy
in
state
of
new
york
with
regard
to
grade
seven
through
12
is
that
because
of
the
added
cost
of
the
textbooks
and
the
technical
nature
of
the
textbooks.
this
heavy
burden
should
not
be
passed
on
to
any
of
the
children
and
the
state
has
formulated
that
declaration
of
policy
in
that
statute
itself.
now,
the
$7.50
figure
is
a
reasonable
rate
when
we
look
at
the
$10
rate
in
section
701.
now,
in
new
york
state
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
of
rosado
against
wyman,
there
were
special
need
grants
for
afdc
or
aid
for
dependent
children
recipients
included.
there
was
included
an
item
for
textbooks
in
these
special
need
grants.
this
court
in
rosado
determined
that
the
state
of
new
york
may
not
sole
proceed
with
specialty
grants.
there
must
a
flat
general
grant
and
following
this
court’s
dictates,
new
york
social
services
law
was
amended
to
reach
so
that
section
131-a
does
eliminate
all
special
grants
excluding
rent
in
fuel,
but
includes
textbooks
and
related
education
expenses
under
the
general
grant
and
the
record
shows
and
it
is
just
been
conceded
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
that
when
the
rosado
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
determined
that
approximately
$3
is
included
in
the
monthly
grant
for
all
educational
expenses
for
the
family
of
four.
so
that
amounts
to
$36
a
year
per
family
of
four.
assuming
that
the
10%
reduction
goes
--
is
involved
here
then
that
would
be
$32.40
per
year
for
educational
expenses.
now,
we’ve
just
noted
that
the
rental
fee
is
$7.50.
so
that
it
is
note
worthy
that
it
is
not
unjustifiable
rental
fee
and
that
these
plaintiffs
--
these
petitioners
can
afford
this
assuming
that
they
budget
the
welfare
grants
properly.
mr.
joel
lewittes
those
poor
people
are
not
in
the
class.
i
understand
that
this
alleged
class
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
assume
they
obviously
they
are
not
recipients
of
welfare
and
therefore
would
not
be
getting
this
$7.50
and
this
$36.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
technically
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
think
that
we
could
conclude,
could
we
not
that
the
state
legislature
when
it
passed
this
law
which
was
passed
in
1965
may
have
very
well
taken
into
light
the
welfare
of
the
social
service
law
and
in
so
doing
felt
that
it,
it
would
cover
the
educational
cause,
but
then
it
would
not
the
welfare
statute
would
not
cover
the
educational
cause
when
you
got
to
the
higher
grades
because
of
the
heavier
cost
of
textbooks,
therefore
the
difference
between
701
and
703.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
you
see
it’s
quite
clear
is
it
not
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
yes,
but
it’s
quite
clear,
is
it
not
that
the
state
of
new
york
really
never
has
been
in
business
of
loaning
textbook
or
selling
textbook.
may
i
also
note
by
the
way
that
the
educational
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
now,
we
have
a
companion
and
there
are
at
least
15
to
20
states
that
have
this
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
the
educational
expenses
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
justice
marshall
there
are
theories
and
education
today
as
they
tell
me
that
children
maybe
educated
without
books
as
a
matter
of
facts
some
of
theories
claim
that
these
textbooks
are
not
at
all
helpful
that
they
are
doing
a
way
with
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
believe
it
is
mentioned
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
think
this
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
yes,
but
they
do
not
say
that
it
is
because
of
textbooks
that
he
knows
how
to
read.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i’m
saying
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
the
state
of
new
york,
statutes
does
not
require
the
textbooks.
mr.
joel
lewittes
they
have
an
approved
list
of
textbooks,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
am
not
saying,
i
think
the
question
was
asked
to
me
is
whether
or
not
its
essential
--
the
textbooks
be
use
in
educational
my
answer
was
that
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessarily
true
that
i
concede
that
because
there
are
theories
in
education
circles
today.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
the
state
of
new
york
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i’m
not
that
familiar
with
these
theories.
it
was
noted
by
the
way
in
the
circuit
court
dissenting
opinion.
there
are
theories
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
pardon?
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
i’m
just
trying
to
answer
your
question
when
you
asked
me
i
believe
whether
or
not
one
can
be
educated
without
textbooks
and
i’m
answering
that
there
are
theories
that
yes.
the
answer
is
yes,
if
you
are
asking
me
whether
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
of
new
york
textbooks
are
involved
in
the
educational
process,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
think
at
this
modern
age
today
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
can
say
there
were
the
visual
aids
and
the
new
developments
and
education
that
make
possible.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
they
probably
do
have
visual
aid
in
this
county,
but
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
the
thing
that
is
certain
is
that
the
kids
do
have
books.
kids
do
have
books
--
the
school
budget
was
voted
and
they
have
books
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
it
may
be
change
next
year,
but
let
me
say
this
justice
marshall,
if
i
may,
that
it
has
been
determined
that
books
are
useable
for
five
years.
books
are
usable
for
five
years.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
it
could,
but
i
think
that
history
of
school
district
is
a
matter
of
fact.
it’s
been
alleged
throughout
that
there
were
three
votes
that
voted
down
the
budgets.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there’s
a
one
school
year
that
they
voted
down
the
budget
prior
to
that
they’ve
always
voted
before
the
budget.
i
think
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
because
of
the
welfare
and
because
these
are
welfare
children
that
are
bringing
this.
i
think
the
welfare
grants
still
cover
this.
in
the
alternative,
i
think
we
could
argue
and
i’m
saying
the
alternative
because
dandridge
talks
in
terms
of
allocation
of
financial
resources.
i
think
we’ve
been
more
than
allocated,
we
covered
them,
but
in
our
own
we
do
have.
new
york
state
does
have
finite
budget
and
this
is
a
welfare
case.
as
much
as
they
would
like
to
construct
this
to
be
one
of
fundamental
liberty,
it’s
not
fundamental
liberty.
they
are
not
arguing
that’s
really
fundamental
liberty
because
fundamental
liberty
would
mean
that
these
textbooks
would
be
available
to
all
the
students
whether
they
are
rich
or
poor.
they
don’t
say
that
here,
they
say
that
we
should
provide
textbooks
for
indigents.
if
it’s
a
fundamental
liberty
they
should
be
arguing
should
(inaudible)
at
all.
the
fact
of
the
matter
it’s
not
a
fundamental
liberty.
it’s
not
a
question
of
fundamental
liberty
involved
here
because
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
reach
the
issue.
i
think
it’s
a
one
of
the
welfare
case
and
the
socially
economic
cases
under
dandridge
and
that
we
have
reasonably
handled
this
problem
with
our
statute
at
701
with
the
grades
seven
through
12
and
703
one
through
six,
which
is
the
most
important
accouchement
of
an
education.
i
don’t
think
the
state
of
new
york
can
thus,
it
has
decided
this
and
should
be
held
to
decide
of
the
school
lunch
program
is
a
very
important
fact
and
no
doubt
in
briggs
against
kerrigan
in
the
first
circuit
they
held
that
they
could
restrict
school
lunch
programs
is
secondary
schools
even
though
that
fell
heavily
upon
indigent
students
that
could
not
afford
the
lunches.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
frankly
justice
marshall
cannot
answer
that.
i
would
say
for
at
least
50
years.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
one
before
i
close.
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
question
with
justice
brennan’s
question.
yes,
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
a
three-judge
court
was
improperly
was
denied
and
that
is
the
sole
issue
here.
of
course,
the
merits
have
to
be
considered,
but
have
they
raised
a
substantial
federal
constitutional
question?
and
this
court
in
the
california
water
service
case
against
redding
has
set
forth
to
test
whether
or
not
if
the
case
is
obviously
without
merit
or
whether
it
has
been
foreclosed
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
i
think
that
it’s
possible
that
it
has
been
foreclosed
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
i
think
in
dandridge
is
the
case
that
we
can
stand
on.
i
think
the
language
in
jefferson
against
hackney
as
well.
i
think
that
if
they
seek
to
attack
the
fact
that
there
is
a
voter
referendum
here,
i
think
james
against
valtierra
covers
that.
so,
i
think
that
it’s
clear
that
using
either
the
test
of
the
unsoundness
or
whether
it
has
been
foreclosed
by
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think
that
three-judge
court
was
properly
denied
below.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
it
is.
mr.
joel
lewittes
exactly.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
no,
no.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that’s
what
they
said
in
the
footnote
with
regard
to
that
astro
cinema
corporation,
but
i
think
the
reading
of
the
decision
here
in
the
second
circuit
shows
clearly
that
they
use
the
traditional
test
as
to
whether
or
not
a
substantial
federal
[voice
overlap].
mr.
joel
lewittes
exactly.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
believe
sir.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
we
have,
but
we
do
urge
that
and
i’ve
also
added
the
significant
fact
of
that
because
these
books
are
useable
for
five
years
that
even
it’s
not
in
the
realm
of
clear
probability
that
we’re
going
to
have
this
problem
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
certainly
that
it
won’t
become
obsolete
within
one
year.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that’s
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
pay
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
they
pay
one
rental
for
fee
per
year,
but
the
rental
fee
is
only
paid
in
case
an
austerity
budget
is
voted.
mr.
joel
lewittes
exactly,
your
honor.
thank
you.
