justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
nathanson,
may
i
ask
if
this
a
case
in
which
the
three-judge
court
should
properly
have
been
convened
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
was
not,
but
if
it
was
then,
are
the
merits
before
us
at
all?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
thought
these
cases
were
litigated
before
judge
travia?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
whether
or
not
a
three-judge
court
should’ve
been
convened,
was
it
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
judge
travia
said,
there
was
not
a
substantial
federal
question
and
the
majority
--
the
court
of
appeals
agree,
isn’t
that
so?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
judge
travia
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
then,
shouldn’t
the
disposition
here
be
that
they
were
wrong
and
send
this
back
for
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
to
determine
the
merits?
i
don’t
see
how
the
merits
are
here
before
us
at
all.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
don’t
we
have
to
if
it
shouldn’t
been
a
three-judge
court
case
in
the
first
instance,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
would
have
been
for
a
single
judge?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
nathanson,
i
just
re-read
these
opinions
judge
travia
on
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
don’t
find
anything
in
them
to
suggest
as
you
have
that
under
declaratory
judgment
either
both
courts
thought
that
this
was
proper
for
a
single
judge
and
then
on
appeal
at
page
63
of
the
record
at
least
court
of
appeals
quotes
this,
“as
at
the
outset
there
must
be
a
determination
as
to
whether
judge
travia
properly
denied
plaintiff’s
motion
for
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court.”
the
three-judge
court
is
ultimately
to
decide
upon
rationale
of
the
new
york
state
legislature’s
enactment
of
701
and
703.
thus,
it
will
be
gained
by
having
this
court
of
three
judges
subject
its
own
rationality
to
further
scrutiny
and
everything
else
in
the
opinion
is
addressed
to
the
question
whether
this
is
properly
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
we
would
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
judge
travia,
we
are
paying
no
attention
to
your
argument
on
the
merits;
we’ll
send
it
back
to
a
three-judge
court
to
address
the
merits.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
it
is
clear
that
declaratory
relief
would
be
sufficient
in
the
event
that
complaint
have
been
meritorious?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
gather
you
do
agree
that
the
special
question
for
us
is
whether
or
not
the
motion
for
three-judge
court
should’ve
been
granted?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
going
to
address
that
question,
are
you
mr.
lewittes?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that’s
no
different
i
gather
than
the
assessment
that
you
have
been
suggesting
had
to
be
made
to
determine
whether
should’ve
been
a
three-judge
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
we
don’t
escape
it
by
that
footnote?
justice
william
o.
douglas
certainly,
that’s
the
way
judge
kaufman
dissented
it
was
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
this
we
granted
a
cert.
last
february.
justice
william
o.
douglas
according
to
your
brief
on
may
the
3rd
of
this
year
the
school
district
reversed
its
policy
and
is
now
furnishing
free
school
books
to
everyone,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
do
you
urge
that
on
that
ground
this
is
really
moot?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
the
answer
to
mr.
nathanson’s
suggestion
that
these
budget
elections
are
annual
affairs?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
you’re
saying
is
a
book
should
have
been
provided
have
a
five-year
life?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
that
at
least
for
the
next
five
years,
children
grades
one
to
six
are
going
to
have
textbooks
in
the
school
district?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
see
and
here
that
was
not
voted,
it
was
later
election,
isn’t
that
it?
justice
william

douglas
