chief

warren
e.
burger
how
soon
after
the
arrest
--
they
were
arrested
with
the
trucks
and
with
a
lot
of
this
merchandise
in
their
possession?
chief

then
how
soon
after
--
chief
justice

next
day.
was
the
warrant
obtained
as
to
subsequent
to
the
time
they
arrested
them
in
possession
of
the
goods?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
sixth
circuit
sought
that
some
of
these
errors
were
harmless
because
these
men
were
caught
with
truck
and
possession
of
the
large
amount
of
stolen
goods,
nothing
could
have
altered
the
result,
is
that
not
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
concede,
that’s
a
pretty
strong
case
against
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
the
fiction
involved
in
the
concept
of
criminal
conspiracy
isn't
it?
what's
the
fiction
of
the
criminal
conspiracy
when
they
establish
that
the
people
have
done
certain
things
in
concert?
it
maybe
a
fiction
to
call
that
a
partnership
and
anybody
who
does,
i
am
sure
it
puts
it
quotation
marks
either
actually
or
figuratively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
cases
did
we
do
that
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anything
that
was
said
about
partnership
law
or
was
the
term
partnership
in
these
cases
used
in
a
colloquial
sense,
a
short
hand
for
saying
that
in
their
criminal
conduct,
they
acted
like
partners
in
the
sense
that
it
was
a
joint
venture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
you
never
want
to
draw
in
all
of
the
chain
of
the
law
of
partnership?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don't
really
say
that
the
government
invoked
the
partnership
law
for
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
this
record
there
was
a
quite
a
bit
of
intrigue
here,
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ever
thought
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
evans.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
wondered
if
you
have
--
the
way
you
begun
your
arguments
you
have
absolutely
ignored
the
arguments
of
your
opponents.
you
talked
about
this
case
as
though
it's
just
another
fourth
amendment
case,
you
haven’t
–
pay
any
attention
to
his
argument
that
this
is
a
conspiracy
case
and
therefore
it's
different
and
that
the
trial
judge
didn't,
had
the
view
at
least
that
this
was
a
partnership,
that's
the
word
he
used?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
--
because
they
“partners”
and
joint
venturers,
at
least
if
i
understand
his
argument,
then
knuckles
was
the
agent
of
brown
and
smith
for
fourth
amendment
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
i
think
that's
what
he
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
was
one
of
personal
perhaps
the
–
of
the
conversation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
to
argue
within
a
border
of
search
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
evans.
do
you
any
further
mr.
lundy?
chief
justice
warren
e.

the

is
