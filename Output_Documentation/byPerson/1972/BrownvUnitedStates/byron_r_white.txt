the

wasn’t

justice

there

here?
justice

okay,
that's
all
i
asked.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
have
–
they
are
in
the
possession
of
the
store,
do
you
think?
justice
byron

white
you
would
really
argue
then,
if
you
ran
across
a
fellow
with
a
stolen
car
you
--
under
any
circumstances
you
can
search
the
car
as
long
as
it's
stolen?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
it’s
stolen,
not
getting
to
any
other
basis
for
the
search?
justice

no
property
interest?
justice
byron

just

justice
byron

there
are
no
cases
around
like
that,
are
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
make
any
difference
in
this
case
whether
there
is
standing
or
not?
you
really
care
so
as
long
as
there
is
no
interest
in
the
store
and
it’s
conceded
that
there
isn’t,
the
officers
were
validly
where
they
were,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
the
claim,
he
has
--
justice
byron

white
but
not
with
respect
to
the
store.
let's
assume
they
have
standing,
they
assert
an
interest
in
the
goods
and
their
legal
seizure
of
the
goods.
they
may
have
standing
to
assert
it,
but
won’t
they
automatically
lose?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
stolen
property,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
seize
it,
don’t
they?
they
are
legal
where
they
are
when
they
see
it?
well,
they
are
not
legally
where
they
are,
they
entered
on
--
no,
no,
we
just
put
aside
the
fact
that
they
did
not
illegally
enter
the
store,
with
respect
to
this
defendant.

he

that
partnership
in
crime
gave
his
clients
any
any
interest
in
the
store
that
they
could
assert
into
the
fourth
amendment?
justice

well,
even
if
they
did
they
would
lose?
