justice

stewart
i
think
that
everybody
would
agree
one
thing
in
this
case
that
that
was
a
wholly
invalid
warrant?
there
is
no
issue
about
that,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
understand
the
government
here
in
this
court
that
proceeds
on
the
premise
that
that
was
invalid
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
was
knuckles
ever
prosecuted?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
not
a
co-defendant
here,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it,
the
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
your
point
at
least
in
your
brief
was
sort
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
should
be
sauce
for
the
gander
and
if
the
government
can
take
all
the
advantage
of
this
conspiracy
theory
than
you
ought
to
have
some
of
the
advantage
of
it
in
holding
that
knuckles
was
a
part,
a
member
of
the
partnership
and
your
agent,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
a
traditional
conventional
kind
of
partnership,
let's
say,
a
law
partnership
and
if
something
is
wrongfully
seized,
can
anyone
of
the
partners
complain
about
it
under
the
fourth
amendment?
for
the
sake
of
the
partnership
say
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
let's
say,
i'm
just
kind
of
thinking
out
loud,
that
i
agree
that
most
law
offices,
they
would
have
a
lease
in
an
office
building
and
every
partner
would
have
an
interest
in
that
piece
of
real
estate.
but
let's
say
that
one
of
the
partners
takes
something
belonging
to
the
sub
partnership,
home
with
him,
takes
to
his
home.
does
every
partner
then
have
a
fourth
amendment
complaint
if
that
other
partner's
home
is
wrongfully
added
and
the
property
seized?
justice
potter
stewart
because
here
rightly
or
wrongly
the
trial
judge
did
tell
the
jury
that
this
was
a
partnership,
he
used
that
word,
didn't
he?
226
of
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
end,
i
think
it's
a
wavier
of
fourth
amendment
right,
can't
they?
i
can't
remember
the
title
of
the
case,
the
duffel
bag
case,
in

he

john

were
waived

the
