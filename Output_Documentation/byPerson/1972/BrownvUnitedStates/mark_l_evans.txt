mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
principally
two
questions
relating
to
the
application
of
the
automatic
standing
rule.
first
whether
it
applies
where
the
possession
charged
is
of
stolen
property,
second
whether
it
applies
where
the
possession
charged
is
possession
that
was
at
a
time
other
than
the
time
when
the
search
and
seizure
took
place.
i
would
argue
the
answer
to
both
of
these
questions
is
no.
the
case
is
similar
in
some
respects
to
the
clums
case
which
was
here
last
term
and
which
the
court
disposed
off
without
deciding
the
automatic
standing
issue.
on
the
day
that
clums
was
decided,
a
certiorari
was
granted
here.
mr
lundy
has
detailed
the
facts.
in
essence
petitioners
brown
and
smith
were
engaged
in
stealing
merchandise
from
the
central
jobbing
company
in
cincinnati.
they
transported
the
merchandise
across
state
lines
to
kentucky
where
they
sold
it
to
clinton
knuckles,
the
owner
of
the
knuckles
dollar
store.
two
months
later
after
the
final
act
of
interstate
transportation,
a
defective
search
warrant
was
issued
and
a
search
was
conducted
of
knuckle
store.
the
petitioners
were
charged
with
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
merchandise
and
with
conspiracy
to
commit
the
substantive
offense
and
on
a
motion
to
suppress
they
sought
to
exclude
the
evidence
that
was
seized
from
the
knuckles
store.
the
courts
below
rejected
these
contentions
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioners
lacked
standing
to
make
them.
in
our
view,
it
is
clear
on
these
facts
that
the
petitioners
have
no
standing
under
the
traditional
standing
rule.
that
rule
requires
a
showing
of
an
interest
either
in
the
premises
that
were
searched
or
in
the
property
that
was
seized.
the
petitioners
here
have
no
interest
in
the
premises
that
was
searched.
it
was
knuckles
stores.
they
have
never
asserted
that
they
had
any
interest
in
the
premises
and
they
were
not
present
at
the
time
when
the
search
was
conducted,
in
fact
they
were
in
custody
in
ohio
having
been
arrested
the
previous
day.
nor
did
they
have
they
have
an
interest
in
the
property
that
was
seized.
there
is
no
proprietary
interest
because
the
property
was
stolen,
it
didn't
belong
to
them.
there
is
no
possessory
interest
because
they
parted
with
the
possession
two
months
earlier.
in
other
words,
their
fourth
amendment
rights
were
not
implicated
by
this
search
and
seizure,
to
the
extent
that
mr.
lundy
has
on
argument
here
attacked
the
traditional
standing
rule,
i
believe
that
as
recently
as
alderman
it's
been
upheld
indefinitively.
the
fourth
amendment
rights
are
not
assertable
vicariously
and
their
personal
rights
and
the
exclusionary
rule
is
limited
to
circumstances
where
one
can
allege
that
he
has
been
a
victim
of
an
unlawful
search
rather
than
one
who
is
aggrieved
solely
by
introduction
of
evidence
that
was
so
seized.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
question
is
a
hard
one
to
pose,
i
think
because
in
most
instances
the
situation
will
be
such
that
the
partner
has
an
interest
in
the
premises
that
were
searched.
the
issue
is
hard
to
even
imagine
a
situation
of
a
partnership
property
circumstance
where
there
has
been
some
invasion
of
the
premises
researched,
but
beyond
that
i
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
it's
a
close
question.
i
think
we
argued
on
either
side
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes
sir.
when
we
are
dealing
with
fourth
amendment
questions
i
don't
think
that
the
partnership
in
the
context
to
this
case
i
mean
i
don't
think
the
partnership
idea
really
applies,
but
even
if
these
concepts
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
my
answer
to
the
argument
is
there
are
several
problems
with
it.
in
the
first
instance,
even
if
we
assume
that
the
partnership
concepts
are
appropriate
in
their
traditional
common
law
sense,
the
traditional
common
law
rule
is
there
cannot
be
a
partnership
for
an
illegal
purpose.
but
even
putting
that
aside,
the
partnership
is
by
mr
lundy's
assertions,
coincident
with
the
conspiracy.
the
conspiracy
ended
by
definition,
the
day
before
the
search
was
made.
they
were
arrested,
they
had
already
given
their
confession,
their
statements
at
the
time
the
search
was
made.
but
in
any
event
even
if
we
go
all
the
way
and
say
that
the
basis
of
this
constructive
possession
theory,
they
had
possession
at
the
time
the
search
was
made,
it's
our
opinion
that
the
possessory
interest
in
stolen
property
is
not
an
interest
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
justice
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
when
we
are
dealing
--
a
stolen
car
is
a
slightly
different
situation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right,
there
is
no
property
interest.
i
would
argue
i
think
that
such
a
search
could
be
made
that
the
difference
is
that
in
some
respects
a
car
is
like,
i
mean
you
can
enclose
things
within
it.
it’s
a
large
place
almost
like
a
house
even
though
it's
not
--
i
mean
you
--
say
there
as
a
trespasser
on
that
car
and
i
would
argue
that
the
car
maybe
searched
regardless.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right,
now
there
is
a
consideration
that
might
lead
to
a
different
result,
which
is
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
not
that
i
know
of.
but
there
is
a
consideration
that
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
other
side
of
that
issue
and
that
is
that
since
we
are
concerned
with
the
deterrent
fact
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
standing
questions,
it
could
be
that
where
you
have
a
stolen
car
and
it's
clear
that
people
can
search
--
the
police
can
search
stolen
cars
without
any
more,
it
might
there
have
some
impact
on
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
if
there
is
standing
in
the
petitioners
to
assert
the
fourth
amendment
claim
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
that
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
not
because
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is
stolen
property.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right
and
in
our
view
nor
do
they
have
any
interest
in
the
property.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
suppose
that’s
right,
yes.
because
the
petitioners
here
lacked
the
traditional
stand
--
the
standing
under
the
traditional
rule
they
sought
to
invoke
the
automatic
rule
that
was
established
by
the
jones
case
and
jones,
the
automatic
standing
rule
is
a
narrow
exception
to
the
traditional
rule.
in
jones,
narcotics
were
seized
during
a
search
and
seizure
of
an
apartment
belonging
to
a
friend
of
the
defendant
while
the
defendant
was
on
the
premises.
he
was
charged
with
various
narcotics
offenses
which
because
of
statutory
presumptions
permitted
conviction
on
showing
of
mere
knowing
possessions.
on
these
facts
the
court
held
first
that
the
defendant’s
lawful
presence
of
the
premises
gave
him
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
premises
to
justify
his
standing
to
challenge
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
of
those
premises
and
to
move
to
suppress
the
fruits.
now
this
aspect
of
the
jones
case
is
not
involved
here
because
as
everybody
has
agreed,
the
petitioners
have
never
asserted
an
interest
in
the
knuckle
store.
the
court
in
jones
could
have
stopped
there,
but
it
went
on
and
it
considered
whether
independent
of
jones'
interest
in
the
premises
searched
whether
he
had
sufficient
interest
in
the
property
that
was
seized
to
justify
standing.
now
it
was
of
course
the
fact
that
jones
possessed
the
narcotics,
that
he
was
accused
of
possessing
and
he
possessed
them
at
the
time
the
seizure
was
made.
and
it
was
apparent
in
the
court's
view
that
had
jones
been
prepared
to
come
forward
and
testify
as
to
his
possession
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
he
would
have
had
standing
under
the
traditional
rule.
the
problem
was
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
come
forward,
he
was
not
willing
to
come
forward
to
testify
and
the
reason
he
was
not
willing
to
come
forward
to
testify
is
because
at
that
time
there
was
a
substantial
risk
that
his
testimony
as
to
his
possession
at
the
time
of
the
suppression
hearing
could
be
used
against
in
the
trial
and
as
part
of
the
government’s
case
in
chief.
because
of
this
dilemma
that
the
defendant
was
faced
with,
the
court
ruled
that
he
need
not
make
the
showing.
where
the
government,
in
its
indictment
has
already
conceded
in
effect
that
he
could
make
the
showing,
there
was
a
corollary
rationale
that
was
articulated
by
the
court
as
well
and
that
is
that
contrary
holding,
that
is
that
jones
must
come
forward
or
in
practical
effect
would
be
unable
to
come
forward,
would
give
the
government
the
benefit
of
inconsistent
positions
because
it
would
be
arguing
in
a
sense
at
the
trial
that
the
defendant
possessed
the
narcotics
at
the
time
they
were
seized;
that
was
the
basis
of
the
charge,
while
the
suppression
hearing
by
challenging
his
standing,
they
would
implicitly
be
saying
that
he
had
no
possession
at
the
time
of
the
seizure.
this
the
court
viewed
as
not
consonant
with
the
amenities
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
first
thing
to
be
said
about
jones
in
respect
to
the
case
here
is
that
unlike
jones,
the
petitioners
here
have
no
standing
under
the
traditional
standing
rule.
as
we
have
discussed
they
have
no
interest
in
the
knuckle
store
and
in
our
view,
they
have
no
interest
in
the
property
seized.
in
our
view,
the
automatic
standing
rule
of
jones
was
designed
solely
for
those,
who
would
otherwise
have
had
standing
under
the
traditional
rule,
but
were
unable
to
assert
that
standing
because
of
the
situation
that
prevailed
at
that
time,
with
respect
to
the
use
of
testimony,
suppression
testimony
at
a
subsequent
trial.
because
brown
and
smith
have
no
standing
under
the
traditional
rule,
we
think
that
they
should
not
be
the
beneficiaries
of
the
rule,
that
was
designed
for
those
who
would
have
such
standing.
nor
does
the
jones
rationale
compel
a
different
--
an
extension
of
the
jones
rationale
to
the
--
well,
nor
does
the
jones
rationale
compel
an
extension
of
its
rule
to
the
facts
here.
since
there
was
no
standing
under
the
traditional
rule,
these
defendants
were
not
faced
with
the
dilemma
that
jones
was
faced
with.
his
dilemma
arose
because
the
testimony
that
he
would
have
been
prepared
to
give
to
establish
standing
could
have
been
used
against
him.
here,
there
is
no
dilemma
because
there
is
no
testimony
that
would
establish
standing
and
there
is
no
testimony
that
--
they
are
not
in
the
position
that
jones
was
in
to
come
forward
and
establish
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it's
difficult
to
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
that
this
is
in
essence
that
had
been
decided
in
alderman,
at
least,
appears
to
be
to
me.
i
mean,
the
ruling
as
stated
by
alderman
is
that
co-conspirators
are
not
entitled
to
a
search,
and
other
co-conspirators
fourth
amendment
rights
and
if
that's
the
argument
that's
being
made,
i
think
it's
been
answered.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
precedent
for
a
vicarious
assertion
of
rights
even
within
a
conspiracy,
whether
you
call
it
it
a
partnership
or
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
the
same
principles
is
applied
here,
nonetheless.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
in
a
sense,
john
smith
had
no
rights
in
the
duffel
bag.
his
rights
were
in
the
property
that
was
in
the
duffel
bag.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
well,
if
his
effects
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
not
mr.
justice
because
i
think
in
that
instance,
it
would
be
difficult
to
argue
that
his
person
was
not
invaded,
that
his
interest
in
his
own
person.
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
same
answer
as
i
have
given
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
that
an
invasion
of
what
one
is
wearing
even
if
what
one
is
wearing
is
stolen,
i
would
think
is
an
invasion
of
the
person.
i
would
now
want
to
have
to
argue
up
here
the
other
side
of
that
issue.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
you
mean
if
they
don't
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
they
did.
my
understanding
is
that
in
the
cartons,
were
things
like
mens
and
ladies
shoes
and
that
kind
of
thing
and
i
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
didn't
go
in.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
have
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
not
because
as
i
have
indicated
--
they
gave
up
a
possessory
interest
in
the
property
some
two
months
before
the
search
was
made.
so
even
if
they
were
to
come
forward
and
make
an
assertion
that
they
couldn't
make,
mainly
that
they
did
possess
it
at
the
time
the
search
was
made;
i
think
that
the
applicable
rule
in
those
circumstances
would
be
the
simmons
rule,
which
resolves
the
dilemma
in
a
non-jones
context,
namely
the
testimony
they
gave
would
have
not
been
able
to
be
used
against
them,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
sensible
resolution
of
the
problem.
to
summarize
the
discussion
with
respect
to
the
dilemma
aspect
of
jones
as
applied
here,
we
think
it
just
does
not
require
since
there
is
no
dilemma
that
remains
at
this
point,
there
is
no
need
to
apply
the
automatic
standing
rule
on
our
facts.
nor
do
we
think
that
the
alternative
rationale
of
jones
requires
an
application
of
its
rule
in
these
facts.
because
in
the
circumstances
we
have
here,
there
is
no
inconsistency
of
position
that
the
government
is
forced
to
take.
the
government
must
show
as
part
of
its
case
in
this,
in
detail
that
brown
and
smith
possessed
the
central
jobbing
company
merchandise
at
some
point,
but
that
possession
was
two
months
prior
to
the
time
the
search
was
made.
the
government
need
not
deny
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
the
petitioners
were
at
one
time
in
possession
of
the
merchandise.
it's
a
wholly
consistent
position.
it's
argument
really
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
search,
there
was
no
possessory
interest
justifying
fourth
amendment
protection.
well
alternatively,
even
if
there
was
such
a
fourth
amendment
interest
that
deserved
protection
or
even
if
there
was
a
coincident
or
contemporaneous
possession,
the
possession
was
of
stolen
property
and
possession
of
stolen
property
merits
no
fourth
amendment
protection.
in
our
view
therefore,
there
is
no
reason
to
apply
on
these
facts
a
rule
that
was
designed
to
benefit
only
those
who
would
have
had
standing
under
the
traditional
rule,
but
for
our
constitutional
dilemma
that
has
been
resolved
in
a
different
way
by
simmons.
the
petitioners
here
seek
not
a
resolution
of
a
dilemma
that
they
face,
but
really
a
reaping
of
an
unintended
and
unnecessary
windfall.
there
is
another
issue
in
this
case
involving
a
bruton
violation.
there
was
testimony
at
the
trial
concerning
statements
made
by
both
brown
and
smith,
which
were
in
some
respects
cross
inculpatory.
we
conceive
this
was
error
but
as
we
detail
in
our
brief,
we
believe
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
unless
there
are
questions,
i
would
not
propose
to
deal
with
it
further
at
this
time.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
principally
two
questions
relating
to
the
application
of
the
automatic
standing
rule.
first
whether
it
applies
where
the
possession
charged
is
of
stolen
property,
second
whether
it
applies
where
the
possession
charged
is
possession
that
was
at
a
time
other
than
the
time
when
the
search
and
seizure
took
place.
i
would
argue
the
answer
to
both
of
these
questions
is
no.
the
case
is
similar
in
some
respects
to
the
clums
case
which
was
here
last
term
and
which
the
court
disposed
off
without
deciding
the
automatic
standing
issue.
on
the
day
that
clums
was
decided,
a
certiorari
was
granted
here.
mr
lundy
has
detailed
the
facts.
in
essence
petitioners
brown
and
smith
were
engaged
in
stealing
merchandise
from
the
central
jobbing
company
in
cincinnati.
they
transported
the
merchandise
across
state
lines
to
kentucky
where
they
sold
it
to
clinton
knuckles,
the
owner
of
the
knuckles
dollar
store.
two
months
later
after
the
final
act
of
interstate
transportation,
a
defective
search
warrant
was
issued
and
a
search
was
conducted
of
knuckle
store.
the
petitioners
were
charged
with
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
merchandise
and
with
conspiracy
to
commit
the
substantive
offense
and
on
a
motion
to
suppress
they
sought
to
exclude
the
evidence
that
was
seized
from
the
knuckles
store.
the
courts
below
rejected
these
contentions
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioners
lacked
standing
to
make
them.
in
our
view,
it
is
clear
on
these
facts
that
the
petitioners
have
no
standing
under
the
traditional
standing
rule.
that
rule
requires
a
showing
of
an
interest
either
in
the
premises
that
were
searched
or
in
the
property
that
was
seized.
the
petitioners
here
have
no
interest
in
the
premises
that
was
searched.
it
was
knuckles
stores.
they
have
never
asserted
that
they
had
any
interest
in
the
premises
and
they
were
not
present
at
the
time
when
the
search
was
conducted,
in
fact
they
were
in
custody
in
ohio
having
been
arrested
the
previous
day.
nor
did
they
have
they
have
an
interest
in
the
property
that
was
seized.
there
is
no
proprietary
interest
because
the
property
was
stolen,
it
didn't
belong
to
them.
there
is
no
possessory
interest
because
they
parted
with
the
possession
two
months
earlier.
in
other
words,
their
fourth
amendment
rights
were
not
implicated
by
this
search
and
seizure,
to
the
extent
that
mr.
lundy
has
on
argument
here
attacked
the
traditional
standing
rule,
i
believe
that
as
recently
as
alderman
it's
been
upheld
indefinitively.
the
fourth
amendment
rights
are
not
assertable
vicariously
and
their
personal
rights
and
the
exclusionary
rule
is
limited
to
circumstances
where
one
can
allege
that
he
has
been
a
victim
of
an
unlawful
search
rather
than
one
who
is
aggrieved
solely
by
introduction
of
evidence
that
was
so
seized.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
question
is
a
hard
one
to
pose,
i
think
because
in
most
instances
the
situation
will
be
such
that
the
partner
has
an
interest
in
the
premises
that
were
searched.
the
issue
is
hard
to
even
imagine
a
situation
of
a
partnership
property
circumstance
where
there
has
been
some
invasion
of
the
premises
researched,
but
beyond
that
i
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
it's
a
close
question.
i
think
we
argued
on
either
side
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes
sir.
when
we
are
dealing
with
fourth
amendment
questions
i
don't
think
that
the
partnership
in
the
context
to
this
case
i
mean
i
don't
think
the
partnership
idea
really
applies,
but
even
if
these
concepts
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
my
answer
to
the
argument
is
there
are
several
problems
with
it.
in
the
first
instance,
even
if
we
assume
that
the
partnership
concepts
are
appropriate
in
their
traditional
common
law
sense,
the
traditional
common
law
rule
is
there
cannot
be
a
partnership
for
an
illegal
purpose.
but
even
putting
that
aside,
the
partnership
is
by
mr
lundy's
assertions,
coincident
with
the
conspiracy.
the
conspiracy
ended
by
definition,
the
day
before
the
search
was
made.
they
were
arrested,
they
had
already
given
their
confession,
their
statements
at
the
time
the
search
was
made.
but
in
any
event
even
if
we
go
all
the
way
and
say
that
the
basis
of
this
constructive
possession
theory,
they
had
possession
at
the
time
the
search
was
made,
it's
our
opinion
that
the
possessory
interest
in
stolen
property
is
not
an
interest
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
justice
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
when
we
are
dealing
--
a
stolen
car
is
a
slightly
different
situation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right,
there
is
no
property
interest.
i
would
argue
i
think
that
such
a
search
could
be
made
that
the
difference
is
that
in
some
respects
a
car
is
like,
i
mean
you
can
enclose
things
within
it.
it’s
a
large
place
almost
like
a
house
even
though
it's
not
--
i
mean
you
--
say
there
as
a
trespasser
on
that
car
and
i
would
argue
that
the
car
maybe
searched
regardless.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right,
now
there
is
a
consideration
that
might
lead
to
a
different
result,
which
is
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
not
that
i
know
of.
but
there
is
a
consideration
that
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
other
side
of
that
issue
and
that
is
that
since
we
are
concerned
with
the
deterrent
fact
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
standing
questions,
it
could
be
that
where
you
have
a
stolen
car
and
it's
clear
that
people
can
search
--
the
police
can
search
stolen
cars
without
any
more,
it
might
there
have
some
impact
on
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
if
there
is
standing
in
the
petitioners
to
assert
the
fourth
amendment
claim
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
that
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
not
because
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is
stolen
property.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right
and
in
our
view
nor
do
they
have
any
interest
in
the
property.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
suppose
that’s
right,
yes.
because
the
petitioners
here
lacked
the
traditional
stand
--
the
standing
under
the
traditional
rule
they
sought
to
invoke
the
automatic
rule
that
was
established
by
the
jones
case
and
jones,
the
automatic
standing
rule
is
a
narrow
exception
to
the
traditional
rule.
in
jones,
narcotics
were
seized
during
a
search
and
seizure
of
an
apartment
belonging
to
a
friend
of
the
defendant
while
the
defendant
was
on
the
premises.
he
was
charged
with
various
narcotics
offenses
which
because
of
statutory
presumptions
permitted
conviction
on
showing
of
mere
knowing
possessions.
on
these
facts
the
court
held
first
that
the
defendant’s
lawful
presence
of
the
premises
gave
him
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
premises
to
justify
his
standing
to
challenge
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
of
those
premises
and
to
move
to
suppress
the
fruits.
now
this
aspect
of
the
jones
case
is
not
involved
here
because
as
everybody
has
agreed,
the
petitioners
have
never
asserted
an
interest
in
the
knuckle
store.
the
court
in
jones
could
have
stopped
there,
but
it
went
on
and
it
considered
whether
independent
of
jones'
interest
in
the
premises
searched
whether
he
had
sufficient
interest
in
the
property
that
was
seized
to
justify
standing.
now
it
was
of
course
the
fact
that
jones
possessed
the
narcotics,
that
he
was
accused
of
possessing
and
he
possessed
them
at
the
time
the
seizure
was
made.
and
it
was
apparent
in
the
court's
view
that
had
jones
been
prepared
to
come
forward
and
testify
as
to
his
possession
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
he
would
have
had
standing
under
the
traditional
rule.
the
problem
was
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
come
forward,
he
was
not
willing
to
come
forward
to
testify
and
the
reason
he
was
not
willing
to
come
forward
to
testify
is
because
at
that
time
there
was
a
substantial
risk
that
his
testimony
as
to
his
possession
at
the
time
of
the
suppression
hearing
could
be
used
against
in
the
trial
and
as
part
of
the
government’s
case
in
chief.
because
of
this
dilemma
that
the
defendant
was
faced
with,
the
court
ruled
that
he
need
not
make
the
showing.
where
the
government,
in
its
indictment
has
already
conceded
in
effect
that
he
could
make
the
showing,
there
was
a
corollary
rationale
that
was
articulated
by
the
court
as
well
and
that
is
that
contrary
holding,
that
is
that
jones
must
come
forward
or
in
practical
effect
would
be
unable
to
come
forward,
would
give
the
government
the
benefit
of
inconsistent
positions
because
it
would
be
arguing
in
a
sense
at
the
trial
that
the
defendant
possessed
the
narcotics
at
the
time
they
were
seized;
that
was
the
basis
of
the
charge,
while
the
suppression
hearing
by
challenging
his
standing,
they
would
implicitly
be
saying
that
he
had
no
possession
at
the
time
of
the
seizure.
this
the
court
viewed
as
not
consonant
with
the
amenities
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
first
thing
to
be
said
about
jones
in
respect
to
the
case
here
is
that
unlike
jones,
the
petitioners
here
have
no
standing
under
the
traditional
standing
rule.
as
we
have
discussed
they
have
no
interest
in
the
knuckle
store
and
in
our
view,
they
have
no
interest
in
the
property
seized.
in
our
view,
the
automatic
standing
rule
of
jones
was
designed
solely
for
those,
who
would
otherwise
have
had
standing
under
the
traditional
rule,
but
were
unable
to
assert
that
standing
because
of
the
situation
that
prevailed
at
that
time,
with
respect
to
the
use
of
testimony,
suppression
testimony
at
a
subsequent
trial.
because
brown
and
smith
have
no
standing
under
the
traditional
rule,
we
think
that
they
should
not
be
the
beneficiaries
of
the
rule,
that
was
designed
for
those
who
would
have
such
standing.
nor
does
the
jones
rationale
compel
a
different
--
an
extension
of
the
jones
rationale
to
the
--
well,
nor
does
the
jones
rationale
compel
an
extension
of
its
rule
to
the
facts
here.
since
there
was
no
standing
under
the
traditional
rule,
these
defendants
were
not
faced
with
the
dilemma
that
jones
was
faced
with.
his
dilemma
arose
because
the
testimony
that
he
would
have
been
prepared
to
give
to
establish
standing
could
have
been
used
against
him.
here,
there
is
no
dilemma
because
there
is
no
testimony
that
would
establish
standing
and
there
is
no
testimony
that
--
they
are
not
in
the
position
that
jones
was
in
to
come
forward
and
establish
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it's
difficult
to
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
that
this
is
in
essence
that
had
been
decided
in
alderman,
at
least,
appears
to
be
to
me.
i
mean,
the
ruling
as
stated
by
alderman
is
that
co-conspirators
are
not
entitled
to
a
search,
and
other
co-conspirators
fourth
amendment
rights
and
if
that's
the
argument
that's
being
made,
i
think
it's
been
answered.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
precedent
for
a
vicarious
assertion
of
rights
even
within
a
conspiracy,
whether
you
call
it
it
a
partnership
or
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
the
same
principles
is
applied
here,
nonetheless.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
in
a
sense,
john
smith
had
no
rights
in
the
duffel
bag.
his
rights
were
in
the
property
that
was
in
the
duffel
bag.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
well,
if
his
effects
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
not
mr.
justice
because
i
think
in
that
instance,
it
would
be
difficult
to
argue
that
his
person
was
not
invaded,
that
his
interest
in
his
own
person.
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
same
answer
as
i
have
given
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
that
an
invasion
of
what
one
is
wearing
even
if
what
one
is
wearing
is
stolen,
i
would
think
is
an
invasion
of
the
person.
i
would
now
want
to
have
to
argue
up
here
the
other
side
of
that
issue.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
you
mean
if
they
don't
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
they
did.
my
understanding
is
that
in
the
cartons,
were
things
like
mens
and
ladies
shoes
and
that
kind
of
thing
and
i
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
didn't
go
in.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
have
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
not
because
as
i
have
indicated
--
they
gave
up
a
possessory
interest
in
the
property
some
two
months
before
the
search
was
made.
so
even
if
they
were
to
come
forward
and
make
an
assertion
that
they
couldn't
make,
mainly
that
they
did
possess
it
at
the
time
the
search
was
made;
i
think
that
the
applicable
rule
in
those
circumstances
would
be
the
simmons
rule,
which
resolves
the
dilemma
in
a
non-jones
context,
namely
the
testimony
they
gave
would
have
not
been
able
to
be
used
against
them,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
sensible
resolution
of
the
problem.
to
summarize
the
discussion
with
respect
to
the
dilemma
aspect
of
jones
as
applied
here,
we
think
it
just
does
not
require
since
there
is
no
dilemma
that
remains
at
this
point,
there
is
no
need
to
apply
the
automatic
standing
rule
on
our
facts.
nor
do
we
think
that
the
alternative
rationale
of
jones
requires
an
application
of
its
rule
in
these
facts.
because
in
the
circumstances
we
have
here,
there
is
no
inconsistency
of
position
that
the
government
is
forced
to
take.
the
government
must
show
as
part
of
its
case
in
this,
in
detail
that
brown
and
smith
possessed
the
central
jobbing
company
merchandise
at
some
point,
but
that
possession
was
two
months
prior
to
the
time
the
search
was
made.
the
government
need
not
deny
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
the
petitioners
were
at
one
time
in
possession
of
the
merchandise.
it's
a
wholly
consistent
position.
it's
argument
really
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
search,
there
was
no
possessory
interest
justifying
fourth
amendment
protection.
well
alternatively,
even
if
there
was
such
a
fourth
amendment
interest
that
deserved
protection
or
even
if
there
was
a
coincident
or
contemporaneous
possession,
the
possession
was
of
stolen
property
and
possession
of
stolen
property
merits
no
fourth
amendment
protection.
in
our
view
therefore,
there
is
no
reason
to
apply
on
these
facts
a
rule
that
was
designed
to
benefit
only
those
who
would
have
had
standing
under
the
traditional
rule,
but
for
our
constitutional
dilemma
that
has
been
resolved
in
a
different
way
by
simmons.
the
petitioners
here
seek
not
a
resolution
of
a
dilemma
that
they
face,
but
really
a
reaping
of
an
unintended
and
unnecessary
windfall.
there
is
another
issue
in
this
case
involving
a
bruton
violation.
there
was
testimony
at
the
trial
concerning
statements
made
by
both
brown
and
smith,
which
were
in
some
respects
cross
inculpatory.
we
conceive
this
was
error
but
as
we
detail
in
our
brief,
we
believe
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
unless
there
are
questions,
i
would
not
propose
to
deal
with
it
further
at
this
time.
