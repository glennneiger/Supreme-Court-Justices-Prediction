mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
i
think
factually,
if
i
may
state
it
briefly,
presents
a
simple
question
of
fact
in
that,
the
crime
charged
in
this
case
involved
a
situation
where
two
men
were
arrested
in
cincinnati,
ohio
with
some
alleged
stolen
goods
which
was
to
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce,
and
taken
across
the
ohio
river
into
kentucky.
the
next
day,
in
manchester,
kentucky,
a
city
police
judge
in
manchester
issued
a
search
warrant
for
state
and
local
officers
to
go
into
a
store
which
belonged
to
mr.
knuckles
and
search
for
stolen
property.
the
search
warrant
was
signed
in
blank
by
the
judge,
the
affidavit
was
signed
in
blank
by
the
judge
and
the
district
court
held
that
the
search
warrant
was
not
worth
the
paper
that
it
was
written
on,
and
he
quashed
the
search
warrant.
however,
the
officers,
i
think
being
unaware
of
that
or
whether
they
were
aware
or
not,
they
went
ahead
and
searched
for
two
days
in
this
man’s
store
and
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
it’s
two
big
trucks
wide.
it
went
on
all
day,
all
saturday
afternoon
and
all
day
sunday.
the
court
suppressed
by
motion
all
the
evidence,
but
only
as
to
the
owner
of
the
store.
the
court
held
that
the
two
men
who
were
arrested
in
cincinnati
did
not
have
standing
to
suppress
the
evidence.
the
case
was
tried,
and
of
course
all
the
evidence
that
were
seized
in
the
store
was
admitted
in
evidence
against
the
two
men
who
are
petitioners
in
this
case.
they
were
indicted
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
think
it
was
the
next
day.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
yes
your
honor.
after
the
goods
were
brought
in
cincinnati,
word
was
gotten
down
to
manchester,
kentucky
and
all
the
employees
of
the
store
of
the
merchandising
company
from
which
the
goods
were
taken.
he
came
back
to
manchester
the
next
day,
as
i
understand
it
and
he
got
the
warrant
from
the
city
judge.
now,
these
men
were
indicted
together
with
clinton
knuckles
who
is
also
not
here.
and
the
first
count
charged
on
them
was
a
conspiracy
to
move
these
goods
in
interstate
commerce;
charge
on
the
second
count
was
simply
transporting
goods
in
interstate
commerce.
the
third
count
involved
the
other
defendant
who
is
not
here.
now,
the
case
was
appealed
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
held,
among
other
things
that
a
harmless
error
had
been
committed
because
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
bruton
had
been
violated,
and
they
upheld
the
district
court’s
ruling
that
these
men
did
not
have
standing
to
suppress
this
evidence.
now,
factually
that’s
the
case
that
we're
concerned
with
here
today.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
these
men's
standing
to
suppress
this
evidence
first.
now,
the
court
will,
of
course,
is
aware
of
the
fact,
they
were
indicted
on
a
conspiracy
charge.
now,
the
goods
that
were
seized
in
kentucky
to
prove
the
conspiracy
could
be
used
to
further
conspiracy
against
these
petitioners
smith
and
brown,
but
it
could
not
be
used
to
prove
the
same
conspiracy
against
the
co-conspirator
and
defendant
clinton
knuckles.
you
have
here
one
conspiracy
which
is
charged
against
three
men
and
under
the
law
of
conspiracy
certainly
any
statement
racked
down
by
any
co-conspirator
during
the
time
of
the
conspiracy
or
during
the
life
of
the
conspiracy
is
chargeable
to
all
the
conspirators.
any
deed,
any
act
or
any
words
spoken
by
a
co-conspirator,
it’s
charged
to
the
other
men.
it’s
his
act
too;
it’s
his
statement
too.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor
and
if
you
will
permit
me
to
i
will
explain
why
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
they
had
a
pretty
strong
case
against
them,
stealing
out
of
a
warehouse
in
cincinnati.
if
all
the
stuff
was
taken
out
of
the
store
was
not
used
against
them,
i
think
they
could
not
have
proven
a
federal
case
against
them,
nor
could
they
have
proven
a
conspiracy
against
them.
now,
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
they
must
have
found
these
defendants
guilty
of
having
committed
the
third
overt
act
charged
in
the
indictment
in
order
to
get
the
case
into
kentucky.
one
overt
act
according
to
trial
had
to
have
been
committed
in
kentucky,
otherwise
the
eastern
district
in
kentucky
would
have
had
no
venue
over
the
case.
it
would
have
been
improper
venue.
now,
that
overt
act
charged
that
these
men
delivered
stolen
merchandise,
which
they
had
stolen
cincinnati
and
taken
into
manchester,
kentucky.
now,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
to
that
effect
that
they
must
--
if
they
did
find
them
guilty
of
committing
that
one
overt
act,
then
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
business
of
being
in
united
states
district
court.
now,
without
all
these
merchandise
that
was
gotten
--
stolen
in
manchester,
kentucky,
they
couldn’t
have
proven
that
and
they
wouldn’t
have
had
the
venue
and
they
wouldn’t
have
proven
any
interstate
transportation.
they
may
have
gotten
for
stealing
in
the
state
of
ohio,
but
they
wouldn't
have
had
any
interstate
violation.
so,
from
that
point
of
view,
i
don’t
think
it
was
a
harmless
error.
i
think
that
if,
if
they
--
i
look
at
a
harmless
error
in
this
manner,
if
you
take
the
evidence,
if
you
suppress
the
evidence
and
take
it
out
of
it,
we
wouldn’t
have
a
chance
to
beat
the
case?
we
wouldn’t
have
a
chance
to
win
the
case?
now,
if
you
are
living
in
there
would
you
have
any
chance
to
win
or
wouldn't
you?
you're
living
in
there,
and
certainly
you
wouldn't
have,
but
if
you
take
it
out,
then
they
don't
have
much
of
a
case.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
really.
if
it’s
suppressed,
its
evidence
is
excluded,
it
is
excluded
out,
say
probably
for
all
the
purposes.
if
you
couldn't
admit
the
evidence
within
the
trial
except
which
the
government
would
have
to
do,
then
they
wouldn’t
have
proven
the
venue.
so,
i
don’t
think
you
would
really
--
if
you
suppress
it,
you
suppress
it
for
all
purposes.
now,
i
am
sure
this
court
is
aware
that
you
had
--
this
court
has
rendered
decisions
in
cases
which
touch
up
well
on
this
point.
certainly
in
the
case
of
jones
versus
united
states
and
simmons
versus
united
states,
alderman
versus
united
states
in
which
a
rule
has
been
established
that,
that
man
didn't
have
to
come
in
plain
possession
or
something,
rather
to
have
the
standing
to
suppress
it.
these
either
were
lots
on
the
premises
or
there
was
some
possessory
interest
in
it,
while
he
has
standing.
now,
i
think
that
in
the
case
which
was
almost
precisely
important
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
is
the
decision
that
was
rendered,
in
july
1971.
it
came
out
of
the
second
circuit.
it's
united
states
versus
price.
the
facts
of
the
case
--
the
facts
in
that
case
were
very
similar
to
the
ones
in
this
case
and
there
was
a
situation
where
some
fellow
stole
a
bunch
of
tv
sets
and
he
took
them
and
hid
them
in
a
warehouses
at
some
place.
the
warehouse
was
not
in
the
possession
or
nor
was
the
defendant
present
when
the
search
was
made
in
the
warehouse
and
the
second
circuit
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
had
standing
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
they
ordered
in
their
opinion
they
remanded
the
case
for
a
hearing
on
that
point,
knowing
that
he
may
establish
it.
now
the
sixth
circuit
of
course
in
this
very
case
here,
and
as
even
in
the
price
case
it
involved
the
conspiracy
also.
now
the
sixth
circuit
of
course
has
taken
the
contrary
position.
they
say
that
my
men
had
no
standing
to
suppress
this
evidence.
carlos
worked
there
and
it
wasn't
a
possessory
crime
and
they
had
no
standing
to
suppress.
now
certainly
the
law
was
not
complied
within
this
case.
the
judge
of
the
police
court
in
manchester,
kentucky
just
signed
his
name
to
a
piece
of
paper.
he
told
the
county
attorney
and
we
can
assume
that
maybe
the
city
judge
of
a
small
town
didn't
know
any
better,
being
a
lame,
he
told
the
county
attorney,
he
said
you
go
and
just
fill
it
in,
i
have
got
to
take
my
wife
to
the
hospital
and
i
think
the
man
signed
another
piece
of
paper
for
the
affidavit,
told
the
county
attorney
to
go
and
fill
it
in.
county
attorney
he
filled
in
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
and
he
talked
to
the
effect
and
the
purposed
effect
and
that
–
they
did
not
have
enough
detail
in
it
and
so
they
tore
that
up,
did
another
one
and
then
they
give
this
to
officers
and
the
officer
went
down
there
and
searched.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
he
made
it,
what
was
the
paper
it
was
written
on.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
that
is
true
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
of
what
think
a
distinction
that
we're
frequently
reminded
that
when
the
--
because
the
constable
bungles
and
the
felon
goes
free,
this
isn't
that
case.
this
is
the
case
where
some
law
officers
went
in
and
engaged
in
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
because
they
were
zealous,
they
disregarded
the
rights
of
the
people
and
they
may
have
acted
out
of
ignorance.
this
is
a
case
where
the
error
was
committed
by
a
judicial
officer
and
by
a
prosecuting
attorney
who
should
have
known
better.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
yes
he
has
been
tried
twice
so
far.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
he
was
a
co-defendant
here,
but
this
case
was
standing
as
to
him
and
that's
one
claim
we
will
talk
about.
court
granted
this
evidence
as
to
knuckles
because
all
this
evidence
said
that,
all
that
was
seized
could
not
be
admitted
against
him.
but
it
could
be
admitted
against
these
other
two
fellows
only
here.
of
course,
i
am
sure
that
the
court
reasoned
that
he
couldn't
just
take
that
(inaudible)
he
introduced
in
evidence
and
then
admonished
the
jury,
you
consider
this
against
smith
and
brown
but
you
forget
about
that
here
is
as
far
as
knuckles
is
concerned.
i
do
not
mean
to
mislead
the
court.
knuckles
was
not
tried
with
these
petitioners.
he
has
been
tried
subsequently
under
succeeding
indictment
that
the
government
is
trying
to
make
the
improvements
on
but
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
first
case
was
a
hung
jury
and
the
second
case
was
a
mistrial
and
the
second
case
was
under
indictment
number
two
and
the
third
case
was
under
indictment
number
three
and
in
the
succeeding
indictments
they
had
two
more
co-conspirators
named
in
those
cases.
but
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
if
you
are
going
to
prove
one
conspiracy
you
can
use
different
quantities
or
qualities
of
evidence
to
prove
it
against
different
people.
if
we
three
gentleman
sitting
conspired
to
commit
a
crime,
it
bothers
me
to
think
that
they
can
use
more
use
evidence
against
me
then
the
can
against
these
two
fellows.
you
all
will
be
able
to
take
same
evidence
to
convict
all
three
of
us
and
you
ought
to
let
same
the
quality
of
evidence
being
used
as
far
as
all
of
us
are
concerned.
now,
this
crime
that
they
have
these
fellows
charged
with
here
is
not,
i
would
say
a
possessory
crime
per
se,
like
you
had
in
the
case
where
the
man
had
the
narcotics
in
the
bird
case,
bird
and
jones
case,
but
the
united
states
could
not
prove
this
case
unless
it
showed
that
sometime
these
men
had
all
of
this
two
truck
loads
of
stuffs
in
its
possession.
so
i
had
to
prove
possession
at
some
point
to
prove
the
crime.
now
personally
i
do
not
like
conspiracies
i
mean,
as
a
crime,
they
are
devil
to
defend,
it
doesn't
take
much
to
prove
one.
the
government
has
got
all
the
kinds
of
evidentiary
advantages
on
you.
they
just
to
have
to
prove
the
conspiracy
that
we
three
fellows
sat
and
talked
about
violating
the
law
and
plotted
a
little
bit,
then
prove
it
out,
made
one
overt
act.
i
commit
one
overt
act,
and
they
got
us
all.
anything
he
says,
two
days
and
fifty
miles
away
can
be
used
against
me
too.
the
law
is
very
plain
in
these
cases.
now
this
court
has
spoken
on
several
cases,
to
the
effect
that
a
partnership,
a
conspiracy,
as
i
partnership
in
crime
that
acts
and
the
statements
of
a
co-conspirator
made
in
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
are
admissible
against
all
the
conspirators,
who
were
conspirators
at
that
time.
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
court
so
instructed
the
jury
in
effect
and
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well,
i
am
arguing
about
this
idea
of
agency
in
conspiracy
to
try
to
reason
the
way
through
and
if
i
can't
have
the
court's
reason
its
way
through
that
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
that's
true
i
am
not
talking
about
that
man.
what
i
am
talking
about
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
no,
sir.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
am
talking
about
the
fourth
amendent.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well
that’s
precisely
if
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
no
sir.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
was
talking
from
my
documents.
now
the
court
instructed
the
jury,
and
i
am
referring
to
page
226
of
the
appendix,
where
the
court
very
plainly
and
it's
in
quotes,
“a
conspiracy
is
kind
of
a
partnership
in
criminal
purposes
in
which
each
member
becomes
an
agent
of
every
other
member.”
now
if
the
government
can
use
that,
i
am
entitled
of
that
same
thing
that
they
entitled
using
against
my
man.
now
if
clinton
knuckles
had
possession
of
all
of
these
merchandise
in
his
store
and
was
seized
under
a
no
count
search
warrant,
then
my
men
are
their
partners,
their
agents,
they
have
joint
possession
of
it.
it
is
a
joint
constructive
possession
and
it
certainly
very
logically
follows
the
law
on
conspiracies.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
no
sir
they
did
not.
they
were
in
cincinnati
and
using
manchester,
kentucky.
well,
it's
allowable
to
use
a
fiction
to
convict
a
man,
but
i
use
that
same
fiction
to
let
him
go.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well
i
think
that
what
the
law
is
trying
to
do
is
trying
to
take
the
concept
of
partnership
law
and
apply
it
out
here
to
criminal
situation.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well,
that’s
been
done
in
several
cases
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
case
out
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well,
it
was
used
in
that
sense
your
honor
but
certainly
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
i
think
the
government's
to
allowed
to
do
that
when
they
prosecute
the
case,
except
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
with
this
man
over
here
there
is
something
ten
miles
away
from
me
while
i
am
charged
with
his
act.
he
says
something
ten
miles
away
from
me,
i
am
charged
with
his
statement
that's
in
the
conspiracy
case,
if
he
is
my
partner
and
we
are
running
a
filling
station
or
selling
cattle
or
whatever,
whatever
he
does,
i
am
bound
by
it.
i
think
it
is
a
bad
fiction.
i
mean
i
dislike
to
say
it
but
i
think
the
--
i
think
it's
too
harsh
at
all.
i
think
it's
–
i
think
the
law
of
conspiracy
if
i
may
refer
to
kolowich
case
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
jackson
in
that
case,
conspiracy
has
a
bad
history,
and
it
derived
from
the
star
chamber
and
it
has
all
kinds
of
connotations
of
intrigue
and
besides
making
(inaudible)
and
government
had
to
(inaudible)
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well
i
don't
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
don't
think
anything
in
that
nature
your
honor.
the
only
thing
it
involves
as
far
as
i
could
see
is
two
folks
are
stealing
and
they
got
caught
and
they
try
to
make
a
conspiracy
out
of
that.
i
don't
think
that
merits
the
conspiracy.
the
government
used
it
and
thought
of
that
making
(inaudible).
no
one
buys
from
another.
another
man
from
columbia
they
make
conspiracy
out
of
that,
that's
a
petty
crime.
it
is
used
for
too
many
trivial
things.
if
i
may
refer
to
the
simmons
case
which
this
court
decided
a
few
years
ago,
that
case
says
this
court
has
never
considered
squarely
the
question
whether
defendants
charged
with
non-possessory
crimes,
like
garrett,
are
entitled
to
be
relieved
of
their
dilemma
entirely
and
i
think
like
justice
stewart
says
i
think
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
thank
you.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
i
think
factually,
if
i
may
state
it
briefly,
presents
a
simple
question
of
fact
in
that,
the
crime
charged
in
this
case
involved
a
situation
where
two
men
were
arrested
in
cincinnati,
ohio
with
some
alleged
stolen
goods
which
was
to
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce,
and
taken
across
the
ohio
river
into
kentucky.
the
next
day,
in
manchester,
kentucky,
a
city
police
judge
in
manchester
issued
a
search
warrant
for
state
and
local
officers
to
go
into
a
store
which
belonged
to
mr.
knuckles
and
search
for
stolen
property.
the
search
warrant
was
signed
in
blank
by
the
judge,
the
affidavit
was
signed
in
blank
by
the
judge
and
the
district
court
held
that
the
search
warrant
was
not
worth
the
paper
that
it
was
written
on,
and
he
quashed
the
search
warrant.
however,
the
officers,
i
think
being
unaware
of
that
or
whether
they
were
aware
or
not,
they
went
ahead
and
searched
for
two
days
in
this
man’s
store
and
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
it’s
two
big
trucks
wide.
it
went
on
all
day,
all
saturday
afternoon
and
all
day
sunday.
the
court
suppressed
by
motion
all
the
evidence,
but
only
as
to
the
owner
of
the
store.
the
court
held
that
the
two
men
who
were
arrested
in
cincinnati
did
not
have
standing
to
suppress
the
evidence.
the
case
was
tried,
and
of
course
all
the
evidence
that
were
seized
in
the
store
was
admitted
in
evidence
against
the
two
men
who
are
petitioners
in
this
case.
they
were
indicted
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
think
it
was
the
next
day.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
yes
your
honor.
after
the
goods
were
brought
in
cincinnati,
word
was
gotten
down
to
manchester,
kentucky
and
all
the
employees
of
the
store
of
the
merchandising
company
from
which
the
goods
were
taken.
he
came
back
to
manchester
the
next
day,
as
i
understand
it
and
he
got
the
warrant
from
the
city
judge.
now,
these
men
were
indicted
together
with
clinton
knuckles
who
is
also
not
here.
and
the
first
count
charged
on
them
was
a
conspiracy
to
move
these
goods
in
interstate
commerce;
charge
on
the
second
count
was
simply
transporting
goods
in
interstate
commerce.
the
third
count
involved
the
other
defendant
who
is
not
here.
now,
the
case
was
appealed
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
held,
among
other
things
that
a
harmless
error
had
been
committed
because
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
bruton
had
been
violated,
and
they
upheld
the
district
court’s
ruling
that
these
men
did
not
have
standing
to
suppress
this
evidence.
now,
factually
that’s
the
case
that
we're
concerned
with
here
today.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
these
men's
standing
to
suppress
this
evidence
first.
now,
the
court
will,
of
course,
is
aware
of
the
fact,
they
were
indicted
on
a
conspiracy
charge.
now,
the
goods
that
were
seized
in
kentucky
to
prove
the
conspiracy
could
be
used
to
further
conspiracy
against
these
petitioners
smith
and
brown,
but
it
could
not
be
used
to
prove
the
same
conspiracy
against
the
co-conspirator
and
defendant
clinton
knuckles.
you
have
here
one
conspiracy
which
is
charged
against
three
men
and
under
the
law
of
conspiracy
certainly
any
statement
racked
down
by
any
co-conspirator
during
the
time
of
the
conspiracy
or
during
the
life
of
the
conspiracy
is
chargeable
to
all
the
conspirators.
any
deed,
any
act
or
any
words
spoken
by
a
co-conspirator,
it’s
charged
to
the
other
men.
it’s
his
act
too;
it’s
his
statement
too.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor
and
if
you
will
permit
me
to
i
will
explain
why
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
they
had
a
pretty
strong
case
against
them,
stealing
out
of
a
warehouse
in
cincinnati.
if
all
the
stuff
was
taken
out
of
the
store
was
not
used
against
them,
i
think
they
could
not
have
proven
a
federal
case
against
them,
nor
could
they
have
proven
a
conspiracy
against
them.
now,
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
they
must
have
found
these
defendants
guilty
of
having
committed
the
third
overt
act
charged
in
the
indictment
in
order
to
get
the
case
into
kentucky.
one
overt
act
according
to
trial
had
to
have
been
committed
in
kentucky,
otherwise
the
eastern
district
in
kentucky
would
have
had
no
venue
over
the
case.
it
would
have
been
improper
venue.
now,
that
overt
act
charged
that
these
men
delivered
stolen
merchandise,
which
they
had
stolen
cincinnati
and
taken
into
manchester,
kentucky.
now,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
to
that
effect
that
they
must
--
if
they
did
find
them
guilty
of
committing
that
one
overt
act,
then
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
business
of
being
in
united
states
district
court.
now,
without
all
these
merchandise
that
was
gotten
--
stolen
in
manchester,
kentucky,
they
couldn’t
have
proven
that
and
they
wouldn’t
have
had
the
venue
and
they
wouldn’t
have
proven
any
interstate
transportation.
they
may
have
gotten
for
stealing
in
the
state
of
ohio,
but
they
wouldn't
have
had
any
interstate
violation.
so,
from
that
point
of
view,
i
don’t
think
it
was
a
harmless
error.
i
think
that
if,
if
they
--
i
look
at
a
harmless
error
in
this
manner,
if
you
take
the
evidence,
if
you
suppress
the
evidence
and
take
it
out
of
it,
we
wouldn’t
have
a
chance
to
beat
the
case?
we
wouldn’t
have
a
chance
to
win
the
case?
now,
if
you
are
living
in
there
would
you
have
any
chance
to
win
or
wouldn't
you?
you're
living
in
there,
and
certainly
you
wouldn't
have,
but
if
you
take
it
out,
then
they
don't
have
much
of
a
case.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
really.
if
it’s
suppressed,
its
evidence
is
excluded,
it
is
excluded
out,
say
probably
for
all
the
purposes.
if
you
couldn't
admit
the
evidence
within
the
trial
except
which
the
government
would
have
to
do,
then
they
wouldn’t
have
proven
the
venue.
so,
i
don’t
think
you
would
really
--
if
you
suppress
it,
you
suppress
it
for
all
purposes.
now,
i
am
sure
this
court
is
aware
that
you
had
--
this
court
has
rendered
decisions
in
cases
which
touch
up
well
on
this
point.
certainly
in
the
case
of
jones
versus
united
states
and
simmons
versus
united
states,
alderman
versus
united
states
in
which
a
rule
has
been
established
that,
that
man
didn't
have
to
come
in
plain
possession
or
something,
rather
to
have
the
standing
to
suppress
it.
these
either
were
lots
on
the
premises
or
there
was
some
possessory
interest
in
it,
while
he
has
standing.
now,
i
think
that
in
the
case
which
was
almost
precisely
important
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
is
the
decision
that
was
rendered,
in
july
1971.
it
came
out
of
the
second
circuit.
it's
united
states
versus
price.
the
facts
of
the
case
--
the
facts
in
that
case
were
very
similar
to
the
ones
in
this
case
and
there
was
a
situation
where
some
fellow
stole
a
bunch
of
tv
sets
and
he
took
them
and
hid
them
in
a
warehouses
at
some
place.
the
warehouse
was
not
in
the
possession
or
nor
was
the
defendant
present
when
the
search
was
made
in
the
warehouse
and
the
second
circuit
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
had
standing
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
they
ordered
in
their
opinion
they
remanded
the
case
for
a
hearing
on
that
point,
knowing
that
he
may
establish
it.
now
the
sixth
circuit
of
course
in
this
very
case
here,
and
as
even
in
the
price
case
it
involved
the
conspiracy
also.
now
the
sixth
circuit
of
course
has
taken
the
contrary
position.
they
say
that
my
men
had
no
standing
to
suppress
this
evidence.
carlos
worked
there
and
it
wasn't
a
possessory
crime
and
they
had
no
standing
to
suppress.
now
certainly
the
law
was
not
complied
within
this
case.
the
judge
of
the
police
court
in
manchester,
kentucky
just
signed
his
name
to
a
piece
of
paper.
he
told
the
county
attorney
and
we
can
assume
that
maybe
the
city
judge
of
a
small
town
didn't
know
any
better,
being
a
lame,
he
told
the
county
attorney,
he
said
you
go
and
just
fill
it
in,
i
have
got
to
take
my
wife
to
the
hospital
and
i
think
the
man
signed
another
piece
of
paper
for
the
affidavit,
told
the
county
attorney
to
go
and
fill
it
in.
county
attorney
he
filled
in
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
and
he
talked
to
the
effect
and
the
purposed
effect
and
that
–
they
did
not
have
enough
detail
in
it
and
so
they
tore
that
up,
did
another
one
and
then
they
give
this
to
officers
and
the
officer
went
down
there
and
searched.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
he
made
it,
what
was
the
paper
it
was
written
on.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
that
is
true
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
of
what
think
a
distinction
that
we're
frequently
reminded
that
when
the
--
because
the
constable
bungles
and
the
felon
goes
free,
this
isn't
that
case.
this
is
the
case
where
some
law
officers
went
in
and
engaged
in
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
because
they
were
zealous,
they
disregarded
the
rights
of
the
people
and
they
may
have
acted
out
of
ignorance.
this
is
a
case
where
the
error
was
committed
by
a
judicial
officer
and
by
a
prosecuting
attorney
who
should
have
known
better.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
yes
he
has
been
tried
twice
so
far.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
he
was
a
co-defendant
here,
but
this
case
was
standing
as
to
him
and
that's
one
claim
we
will
talk
about.
court
granted
this
evidence
as
to
knuckles
because
all
this
evidence
said
that,
all
that
was
seized
could
not
be
admitted
against
him.
but
it
could
be
admitted
against
these
other
two
fellows
only
here.
of
course,
i
am
sure
that
the
court
reasoned
that
he
couldn't
just
take
that
(inaudible)
he
introduced
in
evidence
and
then
admonished
the
jury,
you
consider
this
against
smith
and
brown
but
you
forget
about
that
here
is
as
far
as
knuckles
is
concerned.
i
do
not
mean
to
mislead
the
court.
knuckles
was
not
tried
with
these
petitioners.
he
has
been
tried
subsequently
under
succeeding
indictment
that
the
government
is
trying
to
make
the
improvements
on
but
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
first
case
was
a
hung
jury
and
the
second
case
was
a
mistrial
and
the
second
case
was
under
indictment
number
two
and
the
third
case
was
under
indictment
number
three
and
in
the
succeeding
indictments
they
had
two
more
co-conspirators
named
in
those
cases.
but
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
if
you
are
going
to
prove
one
conspiracy
you
can
use
different
quantities
or
qualities
of
evidence
to
prove
it
against
different
people.
if
we
three
gentleman
sitting
conspired
to
commit
a
crime,
it
bothers
me
to
think
that
they
can
use
more
use
evidence
against
me
then
the
can
against
these
two
fellows.
you
all
will
be
able
to
take
same
evidence
to
convict
all
three
of
us
and
you
ought
to
let
same
the
quality
of
evidence
being
used
as
far
as
all
of
us
are
concerned.
now,
this
crime
that
they
have
these
fellows
charged
with
here
is
not,
i
would
say
a
possessory
crime
per
se,
like
you
had
in
the
case
where
the
man
had
the
narcotics
in
the
bird
case,
bird
and
jones
case,
but
the
united
states
could
not
prove
this
case
unless
it
showed
that
sometime
these
men
had
all
of
this
two
truck
loads
of
stuffs
in
its
possession.
so
i
had
to
prove
possession
at
some
point
to
prove
the
crime.
now
personally
i
do
not
like
conspiracies
i
mean,
as
a
crime,
they
are
devil
to
defend,
it
doesn't
take
much
to
prove
one.
the
government
has
got
all
the
kinds
of
evidentiary
advantages
on
you.
they
just
to
have
to
prove
the
conspiracy
that
we
three
fellows
sat
and
talked
about
violating
the
law
and
plotted
a
little
bit,
then
prove
it
out,
made
one
overt
act.
i
commit
one
overt
act,
and
they
got
us
all.
anything
he
says,
two
days
and
fifty
miles
away
can
be
used
against
me
too.
the
law
is
very
plain
in
these
cases.
now
this
court
has
spoken
on
several
cases,
to
the
effect
that
a
partnership,
a
conspiracy,
as
i
partnership
in
crime
that
acts
and
the
statements
of
a
co-conspirator
made
in
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
are
admissible
against
all
the
conspirators,
who
were
conspirators
at
that
time.
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
court
so
instructed
the
jury
in
effect
and
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well,
i
am
arguing
about
this
idea
of
agency
in
conspiracy
to
try
to
reason
the
way
through
and
if
i
can't
have
the
court's
reason
its
way
through
that
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
that's
true
i
am
not
talking
about
that
man.
what
i
am
talking
about
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
no,
sir.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
am
talking
about
the
fourth
amendent.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well
that’s
precisely
if
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
no
sir.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
was
talking
from
my
documents.
now
the
court
instructed
the
jury,
and
i
am
referring
to
page
226
of
the
appendix,
where
the
court
very
plainly
and
it's
in
quotes,
“a
conspiracy
is
kind
of
a
partnership
in
criminal
purposes
in
which
each
member
becomes
an
agent
of
every
other
member.”
now
if
the
government
can
use
that,
i
am
entitled
of
that
same
thing
that
they
entitled
using
against
my
man.
now
if
clinton
knuckles
had
possession
of
all
of
these
merchandise
in
his
store
and
was
seized
under
a
no
count
search
warrant,
then
my
men
are
their
partners,
their
agents,
they
have
joint
possession
of
it.
it
is
a
joint
constructive
possession
and
it
certainly
very
logically
follows
the
law
on
conspiracies.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
no
sir
they
did
not.
they
were
in
cincinnati
and
using
manchester,
kentucky.
well,
it's
allowable
to
use
a
fiction
to
convict
a
man,
but
i
use
that
same
fiction
to
let
him
go.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well
i
think
that
what
the
law
is
trying
to
do
is
trying
to
take
the
concept
of
partnership
law
and
apply
it
out
here
to
criminal
situation.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well,
that’s
been
done
in
several
cases
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
case
out
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well,
it
was
used
in
that
sense
your
honor
but
certainly
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
i
think
the
government's
to
allowed
to
do
that
when
they
prosecute
the
case,
except
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
with
this
man
over
here
there
is
something
ten
miles
away
from
me
while
i
am
charged
with
his
act.
he
says
something
ten
miles
away
from
me,
i
am
charged
with
his
statement
that's
in
the
conspiracy
case,
if
he
is
my
partner
and
we
are
running
a
filling
station
or
selling
cattle
or
whatever,
whatever
he
does,
i
am
bound
by
it.
i
think
it
is
a
bad
fiction.
i
mean
i
dislike
to
say
it
but
i
think
the
--
i
think
it's
too
harsh
at
all.
i
think
it's
–
i
think
the
law
of
conspiracy
if
i
may
refer
to
kolowich
case
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
jackson
in
that
case,
conspiracy
has
a
bad
history,
and
it
derived
from
the
star
chamber
and
it
has
all
kinds
of
connotations
of
intrigue
and
besides
making
(inaudible)
and
government
had
to
(inaudible)
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
well
i
don't
--
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
i
don't
think
anything
in
that
nature
your
honor.
the
only
thing
it
involves
as
far
as
i
could
see
is
two
folks
are
stealing
and
they
got
caught
and
they
try
to
make
a
conspiracy
out
of
that.
i
don't
think
that
merits
the
conspiracy.
the
government
used
it
and
thought
of
that
making
(inaudible).
no
one
buys
from
another.
another
man
from
columbia
they
make
conspiracy
out
of
that,
that's
a
petty
crime.
it
is
used
for
too
many
trivial
things.
if
i
may
refer
to
the
simmons
case
which
this
court
decided
a
few
years
ago,
that
case
says
this
court
has
never
considered
squarely
the
question
whether
defendants
charged
with
non-possessory
crimes,
like
garrett,
are
entitled
to
be
relieved
of
their
dilemma
entirely
and
i
think
like
justice
stewart
says
i
think
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
thank
you.
mr.
lowell
w.
lundy
no,
your
honor.
