justice
william

rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
man
is
wearing
a
stolen
overcoat
to
spin
this
thing
at
one
more
step.
do
you
think
the
overcoat
can
be
searched
whereas
in
justice
white's
analogy,
without
any
other
grounds
for
search,
since
the
overcoat
is
stolen,
the
man
has
no
standing
to
object
to
its
search?
