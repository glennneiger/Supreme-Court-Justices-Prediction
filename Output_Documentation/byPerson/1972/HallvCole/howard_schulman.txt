mr.
howard
schulman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
arising
within
the
context
of
a
internal
labor
matter,
and
it
could
arise
in
many
variety
of
contexts,
the
fundamental
issue
present
here
is
whether
courts
may
fashion
and
utilize
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
awarding
counsel
fees
in
statutory
actions
to
successful
litigants,
notwithstanding
that
congress
which
provided
the
right
and
remedy
has
not
expressly
authorized
counsel
fee
awards.
the
facts
very
briefly
as
found
by
the
trial
court,
was
that
mr.
cole,
the
respondent
was
a
member
of
the
petitioning
union
and
his
union
for
many
years,
scores
of
years,
scores
of
years,
in
fact,
competed
with
another
union
for
membership
and
job
rights
for
american
unlicensed
seamen,
these
two
unions
represented
generally
all
american
unlicensed
seamen.
the
other
union
in
late
1950
and
early
1960s,
a
repetition
of
conduct
which
had
been
going
by
both
sides
competing
for
jobs,
attempted
to
take
the
employment
opportunities
in
particular
fleets,
away
from
the
petitioning
members
in
their
union.
these
activities
was
found,
they
are
successful
would
seriously
adversely
effect,
both
the
employment
rights,
pension
rights,
welfare,
vacation
rights.
of
the
members
of
the
petition
union,
and
the
petitioner
here
then
acted
to
repel
these
raids,
and
pursue
certain
activities.
in
connection
with
the
activities
of
his
union,
mr.
cole
was
supposed
to,
had
proposed
a
resolution
at
a
union
meeting,
condemning
his
union's
defense
against
such
raids,
and
the
activities
and
the
methods
that
used
resorted
to
defend
against
it
and
there
was
two
fundamental
reasons
for
it
as
he
expressed.
firstly,
it
infringed
upon
his
employment
rights,
which
in
the
maritime
industry
is
called,
shipping
rights.
secondly,
it
was
contrary
to
what
he
had
expressed.
it
was
his
dread
general
trade
union
concepts
that
union
people
should
not
fight
with
each
other.
he
then
to
implement
this
philosophy,
introduced
a
resolution
at
a
union
membership
meeting
which
was
overwhelmingly
rejected
by
his
fellow
members.
in
fact,
just
two
votes
were
cast
for
it,
his
own
vote
and
someone
who
seconded
it.
as
a
consequence
of
these
activities,
which
the
union
felt
threatened
its
very
existence,
charge
--
internal
union
charge
was
filed
against
mr.
cole.
he
received
notice,
a
hearing
was
held,
he
participated,
and
i
must
say
contrary
to
the
aclu
amicus
brief,
he
participated,
and
that's
the
testimony.
the
trail
body,
the
internal
trial
body
recommended
his
expulsion,
it
was
sent
to
the
general
membership,
and
their
membership
meets
in
a
peculiar
matter
of
meetings,
not
one
meeting,
there
are
meetings
held
all
over
the
country
because
of
the
nature
of
the
calling,
both
in
huston
and
the
west
coast
and
various
places,
and
the
membership
concurred
in
the
decision
of
its
trial
body,
as
a
consequence
of
that
he
appealed,
his
appeals
were
denied.
about
a
year
later,
in
fact,
i
think
the
last
appeal
was
in
february,
in
december
he
commenced
the
action,
mr.
hall
commenced
the
action
for
it.
a
motion
was
made
for
temporary
injunction,
opposition,
district
court
sat
on
it
and
i
think
close
to
four
months,
three-and-a-half,
four
months,
and
then
issued
an
injunction,
reinstating
mr.
cole
a
membership.
appeal
was
had
as
a
consequence,
and
the
decision
was
affirmed.
the
complaint
was
amended
and
in
1965,
this
is
almost
three
years
already,
an
amended
answer
was
interposed.
the
general
counsel
for
plaintiff
failed
to
observe
the
local
court
rules,
and
the
case
was
marked
off
the
calendar
in
1966.
restored
to
the
calendar
sometime
in
the
middle
of
1968,
and
tried
in
january
1970.
on
trial,
which
lasted
several
days,
the
district
court
made
some
significant
findings.
number
one,
the
court
found
that
as
contented
by
this
union,
the
respondent’s
activities,
the
court
said,
maybe
resulting
in
a
decrease
of
the
number
of
the
jobs
available
to
his
fellow
union
members.
it
may
very
well
reduce
the
union
treasury,
and
the
membership,
nevertheless,
as
the
court
said,
mr.
cole’s
activity
were
protected
under
the
act,
and
that
the
proviso
which
is
in
section
101
(a)
(2),
which
says
that
each
member
of
the
union
shall
have
the
responsibility
toward
the
union
as
an
institution.
the
court
said
in
this
particular
case,
that
proviso
was
inapplicable
as
the
same
was
not
intended
to
discourage
mr.
cole’s
activities
merely
because
the
ultimate
result
would
not
benefit
his
union.
the
court
further
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
trial
committee’s
findings
that
the
respondent
violated
the
union
constitutional
provisions
as
charged.
an
i
may
submit,
this
was
prior
to
this
courts
decision
at
hardeman
and
the
district
court
found
that
respondents
to
say
no
damage
at
all,
as
a
result
of
his
exposure,
that
every
one
of
his
rights
prior
to
the
temporary
injunction
at
almost
14-month
period
between
expulsion
and
injunction,
each
and
everyone
his
rights
were
assured,
his
employment.
his
insurance
and
welfare
befits
remain
unpaid
and
in
fact,
in
1967
mr.
cole
retired,
and
is
presently
receiving
a
pension,
$250
per
month
from
the
joint
union
management
pension
fund.
and
his
wife
as
a
trial,
shall
have
receive
--
just
by
the
time
of
the
trial,
almost
$4,500.00
in
some
welfare
medical
payment,
she
had
been
seriously
ill.
mr.
howard
schulman
everything
he
overwrites,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
schulman
he
was
accorded
every
single
right,
and
that's
the
court
--
mr.
howard
schulman
i
don't
understand.
mr.
howard
schulman
he
retired
in
1967,
and
since
67
to
date,
he
has
been
receiving
a
pension.
prior
to
that
he
had
been
actively
employed.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
he
would
have
received
in
anyway.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
in
any
event
he
would
have
received
it.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
discrimination
against
him
in
any
shape,
manner
or
form,
and
that's
what
the
court
found,
that
all
--
mr.
howard
schulman
the
courts
relief
--
the
court
went
on
to
make
–
if
i
say
some
very
significant
findings.
the
court
went
on
further
and
said
that
all
the
defendants
in
this
case
acted
in
good
faith,
and
believed
they
had
a
right
to
do
what
they
did
to
protect
their
organization.
the
court
further
concluded
there
was
no
malice
at
all,
absolutely
no
malevolence
by
any
of
these
officers.
the
court
in
fact
did
not
find
as
the
third
circuit
decision
in
gartner
on
which
the
court
relied
upon
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
in
this
case
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
plaintiff
acted
in
good
faith.
a
significant
finding
in
the
gartner
case,
but
had
found
on
the
contrary
that
his
complaints
and
his
grievances
and
his
accusations
were
in
fact
motivated
by
desire,
political
ambition
for
office.
all
cause
of
actions
were
dismissed
against
all
individual
defendants,
and
the
court
granted
a
mandatory
injunction
against
the
union
requiring
reinstatement
permanently
of
mr.
cole.
now
it
came
to
the
issue
of
attorneys
fees
which
was
the
issue
before
this
court.
the
court
said,
based
upon
the
authority
of
gartner
v.
soloner,
384
f.2d,
third
circuit,
that
the
court
had
authority
under
section
102
of
the
act
to
award
the
counsel
fess.
mr.
howard
schulman
this
is
district
court
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
yes.
and
that
in
addition
to
that,
the
absence
of
express
statutory
provisions
authorizing
the
attorney’s
fees
does
not
stop
the
court
in
a
case
such
as
this,
to
awarding
attorney’s
fees,
relying
upon
this
court's
decision
in
mills.
mr.
howard
schulman
he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
howard
schulman
not
the
district
court.
mr.
howard
schulman
court
of
appeals
fundamentally
affirmed
and
said,
as
maybe
appropriate,
as
you
just
said
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
it
appears
to
us,
that
present
here
is
a
--
this
termination,
a
fundamental
decision
which
is
contrary
to
a
very
long
established
rule,
i
think
it's
the
1784,
and
that
is
that
ordinarily
attorney’s
fees
are
not
awarded,
absence
express
statutory
authority
in
the
court
as
used
express
statutory
authority
or
a
contract
providing
therefore,
and
there
have
been
exceptions,
we'll
come
to
them
in
a
moment.
we
don't
believe
any
of
these
exceptions
apply
to
this
case,
but
equally
significant,
and
i
think
quite
significant,
is
that
when
you
examine
the
legislative
history,
when
you
examine
congress'
attempt
to
plenary
body,
it
becomes
manifest,
that
congress
did
not
authorize
attorney’s
fees.
when
we
look
at
the
statutory
provisions
which
we're
concerned
with,
which
is
section
102,
it
provides
that
the
district
court
may
grant
such
relief,
including
injunctions
as
may
be
appropriate.
and
not
to
belabor
the
point,
there
was
no
express
provision
for
that,
other
than
to
point
out
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
fleischmann
case,
that
congress
is
not
reluctant.
congress
wants
to
award
attorney’s
fees
in
express
statutory
action,
it
says
so.
the
footnote,
16,
i
believe
it
is
in
fleishmann,
as
more
recently
title
ii
of
civil
rights
law,
fair
housing
law.
there
is
no
question
that
if
one
congress
wants
done
it,
knows
how
to,
say
it.
in
fact
in
this
statute,
as
we
shall
come
to,
it's
so
expressed
the
state
in
the
certain
instances.
now,
when
we
examine
the
legislative
history
in
the
derogation,
we
find
the
bill
started
as
this
court
knows,
with
the
kennedy
i
bill
on
the
senate
side
in
1959,
and
with
respect
to
section
102
which
we
are
talking
about.
senator
mcclellan
had
introduced
his
bill
of
rights,
but
under
his
bill
of
rights,
section
102
and
103,
there
were
two
provisions.
one,
it
was
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
authorized
to
apply
to
such
relief
as
may
be
appropriate.
the
second
was
a
criminal
provision,
penal
provision.
the
sections
102
and
103,
at
that
time
102
in
the
mcclellan
bill
was
a
penal
provision.
a
debate
raged
in
that
senate
on
this
point,
as
to
the
problem
which
will
be
attended,
that
the
secretary
of
labor
was
to
be
the
one
to
initiate
due
process,
these
sort
of
matters.
the
consensus
was
finally
arrived
at
after
an
amendment
by
senator
kuchel
and
senator
kuchel
amendment
in
substance
substituted
for
the
secretary
of
labor
as
the
party
to
seek
the
relief,
the
private
party
affected,
and
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
done
solely
to
avoid
bureaucratic
chaos.
absolutely
no
one
attempted
to
provide
for
attorney’s
fees,
and
certainly,
no
one
can
seriously
contend
that
the
secretary
of
labor
if
successful
would
be
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees.
now,
section
102,
and
the
senate
bill
as
passed,
then
went
over
to
the
house.
on
the
house
side,
senator
mcclellan,
i
am
sorry
senator
goldwater
took
the
unusual
step
of
appearing
before
the
house
committee
of
education
and
labor
and
explained
to
him,
the
meaning
of
the
language
which
was
utilized,
and
specifically
pointed
out
as
we
have
in
our
brief
at
page
13
and
14.
that
with
respect
to
section
102,
it
does
not
provide
for
attorney’s
fees.
he
further
pointed
out
as
distinguished
from
the
fair
labor's
standards
act,
which
does
provide
expressly
for
attorney’s
fees,
this
provision
doesn't
apply
for
it.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
he
did
not
carry
it
to
the
senate.
mr.
howard
schulman
which
was
his
own
house.
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
there
is
--
i
think
the
manner
in
which
the
debate
occurred
brought
this
about,
because
the
kuchel
amendment
to
102
did
not
come
out
of
a
committee,
it
came
right
up
on
the
floor
over
this
problem
of
bureaucratic
chaos,
and
we
haven't
enable
to
ascertain
any
discussion
on
the
senate
side,
relative
to
providing
for
attorney’s
fees.
we
do
however,
throughout
call
your
--
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
issue
in
substance
was
before
this
court
in
the
hardeman
case.
when
senator
goldwater
went
over
before
the
house,
he
testified
as
to
a
whole
series
of
items
which
a
senate
bill
had
contained.
this
court
said
it
was
an
(inaudible)
analysis
of
the
language
in
the
hardeman
case.
senator
goldwater
discussed
section
102.
he
discussed
section
104.
in
fact,
as
a
consequence
of
his
testimony,
the
senate
bill
section
104,
which
was
the
exhaustion
provisions,
and
was
a
six-month
period
was
reduced
to
four
months.
he
testified
as
to
--
mr.
howard
schulman
the
house
bill
then
contained
four
months,
and
then
committee
accept
it
as
four
months.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
think
it
was
a
combination
of
both
mr.
justice.
i
think
number
one,
he
was
explaining
to
the
house
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
language.
look
at
these
provisions.
i
do
not
think
it
was
a
situation
of
a
loser
trying
to
express
beguiling
his
disappointment
and
being
unsuccessful.
in
fact,
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
the
hardeman
case,
that
this
was
an
explanation
and
say,
“look
gentleman,
look
at
the
language,
look
at
what
the
statute
says,
look
what
the
fair
labor
standards
act
says.
this
language
standing
in
and
of
itself
will
put
the
burden
upon
the
individual.
why
don't
we
do
something
about
it,
among
that
as
a
well
as
other
items?”
mr.
howard
schulman
that's
correct.
i
would
say
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
would
direct
myself
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
there
is
nothing
at
all
by
any
contender
of
this
bill
saying
that
broad
language
will
encompass
attorney’s
fees.
someone
must
only
assume
that
or
infer
it.
there
was
nothing
in
it.
in
fact,
it
has
pointed
out
as
i
shall
come
to
in
a
moment,
after
senator
goldwater
concluded
his
testimony
and
senator
mcclellan
equally
testified,
if
i
recall,
in
the
hardeman
brief
represented
to
this
court,
senator
mcclellan
took
a
similar
position
to
senator
goldwater.
after
that
testimony
there
was
reported
the
elliot
bill
in
the
house
on
the
senate’s
bill.
the
elliot
bill
after
reported
did
not
succeed,
and
a
minority
house
report
was
filed
in
substance
saying
as
i
see,
that
there
is
no
provision
for
attorney’s
fees.
however,
elliott
bill
could
not
command
a
majority.
hence,
thomas
landrum
and
griffin
proposed
their
bill,
but
their
provision
with
respect
to
attorney’s
fees
which
was
the
house
minority
dissent
could
not
command
the
majority
of
the
house,
and
the
bill
as
it
came
out,
took
section
102
of
the
house
bill,
the
kuchel
amendment
with
one
change
not
significant
here,
the
conference
report
parenthetically
inserted
the
words
including
injunctions.
mr.
howard
schulman
that
is
not
so
mr.
justice.
no
bill
as
such,
either
the
elliott
bill
or
landrum-griffin
bill,
as
such
provided
for
the
authorization
expressly
of
the
attorneys
fees,
neither
bill
did.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
both
accepted
in
substance
the
kuchel
amendment.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
neither
dealt
with
attorney’s
fees,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
but
there
are
equally
significant
issues
in
this
matter.
in
the
debate,
on
the
house,
congressman
griffin
stated
directing
his
attention
to
the
102
original
mcclellan
provision
which
provided
for
penal
remedies.
he
said,
“look,
the
convict
we
are
talking
about,
he
was
comparable
to
taft-hartley
unfair
labor
practice
charges,
that's
a
comparable
comment
and
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
for
that.
there
is
accepted
--
generally
accepted
provisions
and
they
are
all
civil
and
this
was
his
understanding,
one
of
the
sponsors
of
a
convict
which
sought
to
be
remedied
here.
and
i
think
this
as
far
back
as
1941,
it
has
been
determined
that
the
only
compensatory
or
other
damages
of
any
kind
available
in
unfair
labor
practice
charges
is
lost
time,
compensatory
damages
and
i
think
equally
significant
is
that
when
we
turn
again
to
the
provisions
itself
of
the
act
and
track
it,
we
find
very
significant
language,
the
identical
language
which
appears
in
102,
which
i
say,
rejects
any
inference
that
attorney's
fees
first
were
not
even
expressly
authorized,
or
even
inferentially
authorized
and
i
am
referring
to
the
following.
the
language
used
in
section
102,
such
relief
as
maybe
appropriate.
we
examined
title
ii,
which
is
the
provision
of
the
act
which
provides
for
filing
reports,
responsibilities
and
so
forth,
the
enforcement
provision
of
that
is
the
identical
language,
the
secretary
of
labor
being
the
enforcement
officer.
and
here
we
have
congress
using
this
same
language.
we
are
now
asked
to
say
it
means
one
thing
here,
but
means
another
thing
here.
and
now
we
go
to
section
iii,
title
iii,
and
we
found
the
same
thing
in
the
enforcement
provision
with
respect
to
that
matter,
which
in
substance
is
the
same
context,
and
used
again
for
individuals
who
exercised
their
rights.
again,
you
will
have
to
have
a
different
meaning
for
the
same
language
and
when
we
go
to
title
v,
which
is
very
significant,
it's
actually
the
fiduciary,
that's
the
akin
to
the
mills
case,
which
is
property
rights,
and
when
they
come
to
that
section,
congress
specifically
said,
“appropriate
relief
plus
accounting
damages
and
attorney’s
fees,
and
i
think
when
you
track
that
language,
it
becomes
very
significant
that
not
only
was
it
not
expressed,
nor
kind
of
be
inferred
and
the
question
of
inferring
just
to
direct
a
few
moments
to
--
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
that
language
referred
to,
but
at
no
time
was
there
any
mention
at
all
with
respect
to
attorney’s
fees,
and
it
rose
within
a
context.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
if
i
would
make
an
objection
that
there
are
not
provisions
for
attorney’s
fees,
and
if
that
was
intended
as
a
reply,
certainly
the
inference
would
be,
“this
has
broad
enough
to
cover
everything
including
attorney’s
fees.
one
must
guess
and
hypothecate,
whether
or
not
that
was
intended
for
that
purpose
and
it
appears
to
me
when
you
have
—
mr.
howard
schulman
sponsors.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
because
his
bill
was
never
adopted.
mr.
elliott’s,
congressman
elliot's
bill
was
not
adopted.
it
was
the
landrum-griffin
bill
that
was
adopted,
which
was
substituted
for
the
elliot
bill
in
the
house,
and
that's
what
happened.
the
elliott
bill
couldn't
command
a
majority,
and
you
have
the
dissent
too
and
you
therefore
will
have
then
coming
up
the
landrum-griffin
bill.
and
which
apparently
could
neither
command
a
majority
with
respect
to
the
minority
report
that
it
doesn't
provide
for
attorney’s
fees
and
that's
how
it
came
through.
i
would
like
if
i
may
just
direct
a
few
more
of
my
remarks
so
i
can
maintain
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
with
respect
to
the
mills
decision
on
the
exceptions
provided
therein
--
the
judge
created
exceptions.
now
we're
talking
about,
first
of
all
when
we
examined
the
statute,
we
find
foursquare
within
this
court’s
decision
of
fleischmann.
when
you
look
at
this
legislative
scheme
title
i,
ii,
right
through,
congress
lays
out
the
rights.
congress
provides
the
remedies.
when
it
wants
attorney’s
fees,
it
says
attorney’s
fees.
when
it
describes
the
nature
of
accounting,
it
says
accounting.
it
blazed
it
out
within
what
i
think
fleischmann
says,
“the
boundary
was
congress
intended
to
be
utilized.
then
we
come
to
the
exceptions.
in
the
mills
case
fundamentally
he
is
discussing
a
property
right,
a
stick
holder's
right.
and
i
must
call
it
attention
to
one
fact,
mills
case
per
se
is
not
an
express
statutory
right.
in
fact,
this
court
specifically
said
that
the
only
right
under
the
section
14
(a)
of
the
security
exchange
act
was
a
declaration
avoidance
leading
to
this
court
the
obligation
to
imply
a
right.
and
obviously
when
the
court
implies
a
right
of
necessity,
it
must
make
some
provision,
how
will
that
right
be
implemented,
how
will
it
be
enforced
and
that's
the
remedy.
the
mills
decision
does
not
apply
here.
this
is
not
a
property
right
case.
in
fact,
section
501
(b)
of
this
act
which
is
the
akin
to
mills,
the
derivative
stockholder's
action,
property
held
by
a
third
party
acted
upon
improperly,
the
therapeutic
purpose
of
that,
congress
was
specific.
it
said,
that's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation,
that's
501,
and
specifically
said,
we
shall
give
in
that
instance
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
as
it
appears
to
me,
this
does
not
fall
within
one
of
the
exceptions.
the
legislative
history
sets
forth
what
it
is.
there
is
no
express
provision.
in
these
circumstances
i
think
to
permit
in
a
case
such
as
this,
that
congress
has
not
expressly
provided
attorney's
fees,
and
if
effect
to
say
equity,
you
have
equitable
powers,
and
you
can
grant
attorney's
fees,
i
think
it
will
be
applicable
to
most,
any
litigation,
any
statute
enacted
and
i
think
would
vitiate
a
rule
which
we
have
had
since
1789
and
if
that
is
to
be
vitiated,
it's
the
function
of
congress.
it's
a
plenary
power.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
schulman
just
a
few
comments.
number
one,
i
would
just
like
to
direct
my
few
comments
to
the
issue
of
malice
and
the
findings
in
connection
therewith.
i
think
the
trial
court's
findings
will
determine
that
and
i
don't
intend
to
devote
my
time
to
that.
the
issue
i
would
like
to
point
out
specifically
to
this
court
is
that
as
this
court
has
so
often
admonished
and
advised
us
and
told
us
that
labor
legislation
is
compromise
of
extreme
views
and
the
question
of
getting
legislation
passed
is
a
distillation
of
the
compromise
and
i
think
that's
most
reflected
in
the
additional
statement
by
the
honorable
philip
m.
landrum
and
honorable
robert
p.
griffin
talking
about
the
permissible
differences
between
the
elliot
bill
and
their
bill.
and
they
say
in
paragraph
one,
title
i
of
the
substitute
that
bill
of
rights
for
union
members
is
essentially
the
bill
rights
in
s1555
as
it
passed
the
senate.
those
who
have
tried
to
pin
a
union
busting
label
on
our
bill
of
rights,
he
is
talking
about
the
landrum-griffin
would
come
into
same
label
on
90
members
of
the
other
body
manifesting
to
me
so
clearly.
now
what
the
bill
was
in
the
senate
and
which
senator
goldwater
went
before
them,
the
house
committee
to
tell
them
what
the
line
was
meant
could
not
command
a
majority
to
bring
forth
any
language
to
provide
for
expressly
as
required
by
the
american
law
for
the
authority
to
grant
counsel
fees.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
howard
schulman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
arising
within
the
context
of
a
internal
labor
matter,
and
it
could
arise
in
many
variety
of
contexts,
the
fundamental
issue
present
here
is
whether
courts
may
fashion
and
utilize
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
awarding
counsel
fees
in
statutory
actions
to
successful
litigants,
notwithstanding
that
congress
which
provided
the
right
and
remedy
has
not
expressly
authorized
counsel
fee
awards.
the
facts
very
briefly
as
found
by
the
trial
court,
was
that
mr.
cole,
the
respondent
was
a
member
of
the
petitioning
union
and
his
union
for
many
years,
scores
of
years,
scores
of
years,
in
fact,
competed
with
another
union
for
membership
and
job
rights
for
american
unlicensed
seamen,
these
two
unions
represented
generally
all
american
unlicensed
seamen.
the
other
union
in
late
1950
and
early
1960s,
a
repetition
of
conduct
which
had
been
going
by
both
sides
competing
for
jobs,
attempted
to
take
the
employment
opportunities
in
particular
fleets,
away
from
the
petitioning
members
in
their
union.
these
activities
was
found,
they
are
successful
would
seriously
adversely
effect,
both
the
employment
rights,
pension
rights,
welfare,
vacation
rights.
of
the
members
of
the
petition
union,
and
the
petitioner
here
then
acted
to
repel
these
raids,
and
pursue
certain
activities.
in
connection
with
the
activities
of
his
union,
mr.
cole
was
supposed
to,
had
proposed
a
resolution
at
a
union
meeting,
condemning
his
union's
defense
against
such
raids,
and
the
activities
and
the
methods
that
used
resorted
to
defend
against
it
and
there
was
two
fundamental
reasons
for
it
as
he
expressed.
firstly,
it
infringed
upon
his
employment
rights,
which
in
the
maritime
industry
is
called,
shipping
rights.
secondly,
it
was
contrary
to
what
he
had
expressed.
it
was
his
dread
general
trade
union
concepts
that
union
people
should
not
fight
with
each
other.
he
then
to
implement
this
philosophy,
introduced
a
resolution
at
a
union
membership
meeting
which
was
overwhelmingly
rejected
by
his
fellow
members.
in
fact,
just
two
votes
were
cast
for
it,
his
own
vote
and
someone
who
seconded
it.
as
a
consequence
of
these
activities,
which
the
union
felt
threatened
its
very
existence,
charge
--
internal
union
charge
was
filed
against
mr.
cole.
he
received
notice,
a
hearing
was
held,
he
participated,
and
i
must
say
contrary
to
the
aclu
amicus
brief,
he
participated,
and
that's
the
testimony.
the
trail
body,
the
internal
trial
body
recommended
his
expulsion,
it
was
sent
to
the
general
membership,
and
their
membership
meets
in
a
peculiar
matter
of
meetings,
not
one
meeting,
there
are
meetings
held
all
over
the
country
because
of
the
nature
of
the
calling,
both
in
huston
and
the
west
coast
and
various
places,
and
the
membership
concurred
in
the
decision
of
its
trial
body,
as
a
consequence
of
that
he
appealed,
his
appeals
were
denied.
about
a
year
later,
in
fact,
i
think
the
last
appeal
was
in
february,
in
december
he
commenced
the
action,
mr.
hall
commenced
the
action
for
it.
a
motion
was
made
for
temporary
injunction,
opposition,
district
court
sat
on
it
and
i
think
close
to
four
months,
three-and-a-half,
four
months,
and
then
issued
an
injunction,
reinstating
mr.
cole
a
membership.
appeal
was
had
as
a
consequence,
and
the
decision
was
affirmed.
the
complaint
was
amended
and
in
1965,
this
is
almost
three
years
already,
an
amended
answer
was
interposed.
the
general
counsel
for
plaintiff
failed
to
observe
the
local
court
rules,
and
the
case
was
marked
off
the
calendar
in
1966.
restored
to
the
calendar
sometime
in
the
middle
of
1968,
and
tried
in
january
1970.
on
trial,
which
lasted
several
days,
the
district
court
made
some
significant
findings.
number
one,
the
court
found
that
as
contented
by
this
union,
the
respondent’s
activities,
the
court
said,
maybe
resulting
in
a
decrease
of
the
number
of
the
jobs
available
to
his
fellow
union
members.
it
may
very
well
reduce
the
union
treasury,
and
the
membership,
nevertheless,
as
the
court
said,
mr.
cole’s
activity
were
protected
under
the
act,
and
that
the
proviso
which
is
in
section
101
(a)
(2),
which
says
that
each
member
of
the
union
shall
have
the
responsibility
toward
the
union
as
an
institution.
the
court
said
in
this
particular
case,
that
proviso
was
inapplicable
as
the
same
was
not
intended
to
discourage
mr.
cole’s
activities
merely
because
the
ultimate
result
would
not
benefit
his
union.
the
court
further
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
trial
committee’s
findings
that
the
respondent
violated
the
union
constitutional
provisions
as
charged.
an
i
may
submit,
this
was
prior
to
this
courts
decision
at
hardeman
and
the
district
court
found
that
respondents
to
say
no
damage
at
all,
as
a
result
of
his
exposure,
that
every
one
of
his
rights
prior
to
the
temporary
injunction
at
almost
14-month
period
between
expulsion
and
injunction,
each
and
everyone
his
rights
were
assured,
his
employment.
his
insurance
and
welfare
befits
remain
unpaid
and
in
fact,
in
1967
mr.
cole
retired,
and
is
presently
receiving
a
pension,
$250
per
month
from
the
joint
union
management
pension
fund.
and
his
wife
as
a
trial,
shall
have
receive
--
just
by
the
time
of
the
trial,
almost
$4,500.00
in
some
welfare
medical
payment,
she
had
been
seriously
ill.
mr.
howard
schulman
everything
he
overwrites,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
schulman
he
was
accorded
every
single
right,
and
that's
the
court
--
mr.
howard
schulman
i
don't
understand.
mr.
howard
schulman
he
retired
in
1967,
and
since
67
to
date,
he
has
been
receiving
a
pension.
prior
to
that
he
had
been
actively
employed.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
he
would
have
received
in
anyway.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
in
any
event
he
would
have
received
it.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
discrimination
against
him
in
any
shape,
manner
or
form,
and
that's
what
the
court
found,
that
all
--
mr.
howard
schulman
the
courts
relief
--
the
court
went
on
to
make
–
if
i
say
some
very
significant
findings.
the
court
went
on
further
and
said
that
all
the
defendants
in
this
case
acted
in
good
faith,
and
believed
they
had
a
right
to
do
what
they
did
to
protect
their
organization.
the
court
further
concluded
there
was
no
malice
at
all,
absolutely
no
malevolence
by
any
of
these
officers.
the
court
in
fact
did
not
find
as
the
third
circuit
decision
in
gartner
on
which
the
court
relied
upon
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
in
this
case
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
plaintiff
acted
in
good
faith.
a
significant
finding
in
the
gartner
case,
but
had
found
on
the
contrary
that
his
complaints
and
his
grievances
and
his
accusations
were
in
fact
motivated
by
desire,
political
ambition
for
office.
all
cause
of
actions
were
dismissed
against
all
individual
defendants,
and
the
court
granted
a
mandatory
injunction
against
the
union
requiring
reinstatement
permanently
of
mr.
cole.
now
it
came
to
the
issue
of
attorneys
fees
which
was
the
issue
before
this
court.
the
court
said,
based
upon
the
authority
of
gartner
v.
soloner,
384
f.2d,
third
circuit,
that
the
court
had
authority
under
section
102
of
the
act
to
award
the
counsel
fess.
mr.
howard
schulman
this
is
district
court
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
yes.
and
that
in
addition
to
that,
the
absence
of
express
statutory
provisions
authorizing
the
attorney’s
fees
does
not
stop
the
court
in
a
case
such
as
this,
to
awarding
attorney’s
fees,
relying
upon
this
court's
decision
in
mills.
mr.
howard
schulman
he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
howard
schulman
not
the
district
court.
mr.
howard
schulman
court
of
appeals
fundamentally
affirmed
and
said,
as
maybe
appropriate,
as
you
just
said
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
it
appears
to
us,
that
present
here
is
a
--
this
termination,
a
fundamental
decision
which
is
contrary
to
a
very
long
established
rule,
i
think
it's
the
1784,
and
that
is
that
ordinarily
attorney’s
fees
are
not
awarded,
absence
express
statutory
authority
in
the
court
as
used
express
statutory
authority
or
a
contract
providing
therefore,
and
there
have
been
exceptions,
we'll
come
to
them
in
a
moment.
we
don't
believe
any
of
these
exceptions
apply
to
this
case,
but
equally
significant,
and
i
think
quite
significant,
is
that
when
you
examine
the
legislative
history,
when
you
examine
congress'
attempt
to
plenary
body,
it
becomes
manifest,
that
congress
did
not
authorize
attorney’s
fees.
when
we
look
at
the
statutory
provisions
which
we're
concerned
with,
which
is
section
102,
it
provides
that
the
district
court
may
grant
such
relief,
including
injunctions
as
may
be
appropriate.
and
not
to
belabor
the
point,
there
was
no
express
provision
for
that,
other
than
to
point
out
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
fleischmann
case,
that
congress
is
not
reluctant.
congress
wants
to
award
attorney’s
fees
in
express
statutory
action,
it
says
so.
the
footnote,
16,
i
believe
it
is
in
fleishmann,
as
more
recently
title
ii
of
civil
rights
law,
fair
housing
law.
there
is
no
question
that
if
one
congress
wants
done
it,
knows
how
to,
say
it.
in
fact
in
this
statute,
as
we
shall
come
to,
it's
so
expressed
the
state
in
the
certain
instances.
now,
when
we
examine
the
legislative
history
in
the
derogation,
we
find
the
bill
started
as
this
court
knows,
with
the
kennedy
i
bill
on
the
senate
side
in
1959,
and
with
respect
to
section
102
which
we
are
talking
about.
senator
mcclellan
had
introduced
his
bill
of
rights,
but
under
his
bill
of
rights,
section
102
and
103,
there
were
two
provisions.
one,
it
was
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
authorized
to
apply
to
such
relief
as
may
be
appropriate.
the
second
was
a
criminal
provision,
penal
provision.
the
sections
102
and
103,
at
that
time
102
in
the
mcclellan
bill
was
a
penal
provision.
a
debate
raged
in
that
senate
on
this
point,
as
to
the
problem
which
will
be
attended,
that
the
secretary
of
labor
was
to
be
the
one
to
initiate
due
process,
these
sort
of
matters.
the
consensus
was
finally
arrived
at
after
an
amendment
by
senator
kuchel
and
senator
kuchel
amendment
in
substance
substituted
for
the
secretary
of
labor
as
the
party
to
seek
the
relief,
the
private
party
affected,
and
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
done
solely
to
avoid
bureaucratic
chaos.
absolutely
no
one
attempted
to
provide
for
attorney’s
fees,
and
certainly,
no
one
can
seriously
contend
that
the
secretary
of
labor
if
successful
would
be
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees.
now,
section
102,
and
the
senate
bill
as
passed,
then
went
over
to
the
house.
on
the
house
side,
senator
mcclellan,
i
am
sorry
senator
goldwater
took
the
unusual
step
of
appearing
before
the
house
committee
of
education
and
labor
and
explained
to
him,
the
meaning
of
the
language
which
was
utilized,
and
specifically
pointed
out
as
we
have
in
our
brief
at
page
13
and
14.
that
with
respect
to
section
102,
it
does
not
provide
for
attorney’s
fees.
he
further
pointed
out
as
distinguished
from
the
fair
labor's
standards
act,
which
does
provide
expressly
for
attorney’s
fees,
this
provision
doesn't
apply
for
it.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
he
did
not
carry
it
to
the
senate.
mr.
howard
schulman
which
was
his
own
house.
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
there
is
--
i
think
the
manner
in
which
the
debate
occurred
brought
this
about,
because
the
kuchel
amendment
to
102
did
not
come
out
of
a
committee,
it
came
right
up
on
the
floor
over
this
problem
of
bureaucratic
chaos,
and
we
haven't
enable
to
ascertain
any
discussion
on
the
senate
side,
relative
to
providing
for
attorney’s
fees.
we
do
however,
throughout
call
your
--
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
issue
in
substance
was
before
this
court
in
the
hardeman
case.
when
senator
goldwater
went
over
before
the
house,
he
testified
as
to
a
whole
series
of
items
which
a
senate
bill
had
contained.
this
court
said
it
was
an
(inaudible)
analysis
of
the
language
in
the
hardeman
case.
senator
goldwater
discussed
section
102.
he
discussed
section
104.
in
fact,
as
a
consequence
of
his
testimony,
the
senate
bill
section
104,
which
was
the
exhaustion
provisions,
and
was
a
six-month
period
was
reduced
to
four
months.
he
testified
as
to
--
mr.
howard
schulman
the
house
bill
then
contained
four
months,
and
then
committee
accept
it
as
four
months.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
think
it
was
a
combination
of
both
mr.
justice.
i
think
number
one,
he
was
explaining
to
the
house
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
language.
look
at
these
provisions.
i
do
not
think
it
was
a
situation
of
a
loser
trying
to
express
beguiling
his
disappointment
and
being
unsuccessful.
in
fact,
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
the
hardeman
case,
that
this
was
an
explanation
and
say,
“look
gentleman,
look
at
the
language,
look
at
what
the
statute
says,
look
what
the
fair
labor
standards
act
says.
this
language
standing
in
and
of
itself
will
put
the
burden
upon
the
individual.
why
don't
we
do
something
about
it,
among
that
as
a
well
as
other
items?”
mr.
howard
schulman
that's
correct.
i
would
say
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
would
direct
myself
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
there
is
nothing
at
all
by
any
contender
of
this
bill
saying
that
broad
language
will
encompass
attorney’s
fees.
someone
must
only
assume
that
or
infer
it.
there
was
nothing
in
it.
in
fact,
it
has
pointed
out
as
i
shall
come
to
in
a
moment,
after
senator
goldwater
concluded
his
testimony
and
senator
mcclellan
equally
testified,
if
i
recall,
in
the
hardeman
brief
represented
to
this
court,
senator
mcclellan
took
a
similar
position
to
senator
goldwater.
after
that
testimony
there
was
reported
the
elliot
bill
in
the
house
on
the
senate’s
bill.
the
elliot
bill
after
reported
did
not
succeed,
and
a
minority
house
report
was
filed
in
substance
saying
as
i
see,
that
there
is
no
provision
for
attorney’s
fees.
however,
elliott
bill
could
not
command
a
majority.
hence,
thomas
landrum
and
griffin
proposed
their
bill,
but
their
provision
with
respect
to
attorney’s
fees
which
was
the
house
minority
dissent
could
not
command
the
majority
of
the
house,
and
the
bill
as
it
came
out,
took
section
102
of
the
house
bill,
the
kuchel
amendment
with
one
change
not
significant
here,
the
conference
report
parenthetically
inserted
the
words
including
injunctions.
mr.
howard
schulman
that
is
not
so
mr.
justice.
no
bill
as
such,
either
the
elliott
bill
or
landrum-griffin
bill,
as
such
provided
for
the
authorization
expressly
of
the
attorneys
fees,
neither
bill
did.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
both
accepted
in
substance
the
kuchel
amendment.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
neither
dealt
with
attorney’s
fees,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
but
there
are
equally
significant
issues
in
this
matter.
in
the
debate,
on
the
house,
congressman
griffin
stated
directing
his
attention
to
the
102
original
mcclellan
provision
which
provided
for
penal
remedies.
he
said,
“look,
the
convict
we
are
talking
about,
he
was
comparable
to
taft-hartley
unfair
labor
practice
charges,
that's
a
comparable
comment
and
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
for
that.
there
is
accepted
--
generally
accepted
provisions
and
they
are
all
civil
and
this
was
his
understanding,
one
of
the
sponsors
of
a
convict
which
sought
to
be
remedied
here.
and
i
think
this
as
far
back
as
1941,
it
has
been
determined
that
the
only
compensatory
or
other
damages
of
any
kind
available
in
unfair
labor
practice
charges
is
lost
time,
compensatory
damages
and
i
think
equally
significant
is
that
when
we
turn
again
to
the
provisions
itself
of
the
act
and
track
it,
we
find
very
significant
language,
the
identical
language
which
appears
in
102,
which
i
say,
rejects
any
inference
that
attorney's
fees
first
were
not
even
expressly
authorized,
or
even
inferentially
authorized
and
i
am
referring
to
the
following.
the
language
used
in
section
102,
such
relief
as
maybe
appropriate.
we
examined
title
ii,
which
is
the
provision
of
the
act
which
provides
for
filing
reports,
responsibilities
and
so
forth,
the
enforcement
provision
of
that
is
the
identical
language,
the
secretary
of
labor
being
the
enforcement
officer.
and
here
we
have
congress
using
this
same
language.
we
are
now
asked
to
say
it
means
one
thing
here,
but
means
another
thing
here.
and
now
we
go
to
section
iii,
title
iii,
and
we
found
the
same
thing
in
the
enforcement
provision
with
respect
to
that
matter,
which
in
substance
is
the
same
context,
and
used
again
for
individuals
who
exercised
their
rights.
again,
you
will
have
to
have
a
different
meaning
for
the
same
language
and
when
we
go
to
title
v,
which
is
very
significant,
it's
actually
the
fiduciary,
that's
the
akin
to
the
mills
case,
which
is
property
rights,
and
when
they
come
to
that
section,
congress
specifically
said,
“appropriate
relief
plus
accounting
damages
and
attorney’s
fees,
and
i
think
when
you
track
that
language,
it
becomes
very
significant
that
not
only
was
it
not
expressed,
nor
kind
of
be
inferred
and
the
question
of
inferring
just
to
direct
a
few
moments
to
--
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
that
language
referred
to,
but
at
no
time
was
there
any
mention
at
all
with
respect
to
attorney’s
fees,
and
it
rose
within
a
context.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
if
i
would
make
an
objection
that
there
are
not
provisions
for
attorney’s
fees,
and
if
that
was
intended
as
a
reply,
certainly
the
inference
would
be,
“this
has
broad
enough
to
cover
everything
including
attorney’s
fees.
one
must
guess
and
hypothecate,
whether
or
not
that
was
intended
for
that
purpose
and
it
appears
to
me
when
you
have
—
mr.
howard
schulman
sponsors.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
because
his
bill
was
never
adopted.
mr.
elliott’s,
congressman
elliot's
bill
was
not
adopted.
it
was
the
landrum-griffin
bill
that
was
adopted,
which
was
substituted
for
the
elliot
bill
in
the
house,
and
that's
what
happened.
the
elliott
bill
couldn't
command
a
majority,
and
you
have
the
dissent
too
and
you
therefore
will
have
then
coming
up
the
landrum-griffin
bill.
and
which
apparently
could
neither
command
a
majority
with
respect
to
the
minority
report
that
it
doesn't
provide
for
attorney’s
fees
and
that's
how
it
came
through.
i
would
like
if
i
may
just
direct
a
few
more
of
my
remarks
so
i
can
maintain
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
with
respect
to
the
mills
decision
on
the
exceptions
provided
therein
--
the
judge
created
exceptions.
now
we're
talking
about,
first
of
all
when
we
examined
the
statute,
we
find
foursquare
within
this
court’s
decision
of
fleischmann.
when
you
look
at
this
legislative
scheme
title
i,
ii,
right
through,
congress
lays
out
the
rights.
congress
provides
the
remedies.
when
it
wants
attorney’s
fees,
it
says
attorney’s
fees.
when
it
describes
the
nature
of
accounting,
it
says
accounting.
it
blazed
it
out
within
what
i
think
fleischmann
says,
“the
boundary
was
congress
intended
to
be
utilized.
then
we
come
to
the
exceptions.
in
the
mills
case
fundamentally
he
is
discussing
a
property
right,
a
stick
holder's
right.
and
i
must
call
it
attention
to
one
fact,
mills
case
per
se
is
not
an
express
statutory
right.
in
fact,
this
court
specifically
said
that
the
only
right
under
the
section
14
(a)
of
the
security
exchange
act
was
a
declaration
avoidance
leading
to
this
court
the
obligation
to
imply
a
right.
and
obviously
when
the
court
implies
a
right
of
necessity,
it
must
make
some
provision,
how
will
that
right
be
implemented,
how
will
it
be
enforced
and
that's
the
remedy.
the
mills
decision
does
not
apply
here.
this
is
not
a
property
right
case.
in
fact,
section
501
(b)
of
this
act
which
is
the
akin
to
mills,
the
derivative
stockholder's
action,
property
held
by
a
third
party
acted
upon
improperly,
the
therapeutic
purpose
of
that,
congress
was
specific.
it
said,
that's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation,
that's
501,
and
specifically
said,
we
shall
give
in
that
instance
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
as
it
appears
to
me,
this
does
not
fall
within
one
of
the
exceptions.
the
legislative
history
sets
forth
what
it
is.
there
is
no
express
provision.
in
these
circumstances
i
think
to
permit
in
a
case
such
as
this,
that
congress
has
not
expressly
provided
attorney's
fees,
and
if
effect
to
say
equity,
you
have
equitable
powers,
and
you
can
grant
attorney's
fees,
i
think
it
will
be
applicable
to
most,
any
litigation,
any
statute
enacted
and
i
think
would
vitiate
a
rule
which
we
have
had
since
1789
and
if
that
is
to
be
vitiated,
it's
the
function
of
congress.
it's
a
plenary
power.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
schulman
just
a
few
comments.
number
one,
i
would
just
like
to
direct
my
few
comments
to
the
issue
of
malice
and
the
findings
in
connection
therewith.
i
think
the
trial
court's
findings
will
determine
that
and
i
don't
intend
to
devote
my
time
to
that.
the
issue
i
would
like
to
point
out
specifically
to
this
court
is
that
as
this
court
has
so
often
admonished
and
advised
us
and
told
us
that
labor
legislation
is
compromise
of
extreme
views
and
the
question
of
getting
legislation
passed
is
a
distillation
of
the
compromise
and
i
think
that's
most
reflected
in
the
additional
statement
by
the
honorable
philip
m.
landrum
and
honorable
robert
p.
griffin
talking
about
the
permissible
differences
between
the
elliot
bill
and
their
bill.
and
they
say
in
paragraph
one,
title
i
of
the
substitute
that
bill
of
rights
for
union
members
is
essentially
the
bill
rights
in
s1555
as
it
passed
the
senate.
those
who
have
tried
to
pin
a
union
busting
label
on
our
bill
of
rights,
he
is
talking
about
the
landrum-griffin
would
come
into
same
label
on
90
members
of
the
other
body
manifesting
to
me
so
clearly.
now
what
the
bill
was
in
the
senate
and
which
senator
goldwater
went
before
them,
the
house
committee
to
tell
them
what
the
line
was
meant
could
not
command
a
majority
to
bring
forth
any
language
to
provide
for
expressly
as
required
by
the
american
law
for
the
authority
to
grant
counsel
fees.
thank
you
very
much.
