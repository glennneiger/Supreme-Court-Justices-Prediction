what
about

what
do
you
say,
the

relief
consisted
of?
chief

warren
e.
burger
i
got
some
impression
mr.
schulman
of
this
record,
and
you
perhaps
can
clarify
it
for
me,
that
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
did
not
affirmatively
provide
before
attorney’s
fees
is
that
there
were
some
thought
that
the
statute
without
that
explicit
provision
was
broad
enough
to
give
a
very
broad
relief.

it's
my

impression
on

again
mr.

i
think
i
have
put
my
finger
on
what
had
raised
this
subject
in
my
mind.
congressman
elliott
apparently
in
the
debate
responding,
it
would
seem
in
this
context
to
this
problem
about
fees,
said
that
the
court’s
jurisdiction
to
grant
such
other
and
further
relief
as
maybe
appropriate,
gives
it
wide
latitude
to
grant
relief
according
to
the
necessities
of
the
case
to
cover
any
loss
suffered
by
members.
