this
is
the
district
court
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
reduced
by
the
house
or--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
think
senator
goldwater’s
vision
perhaps
was
the
fight
having
been
lost
in
the
senate.
he
was
going
over
to
the
house
to
try
to
get
them
to
stiffen
the
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
he
is
trying
in
fact
to
get
the
house
to
do
something
that
the
senate
was
unwilling
to
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
had
been
an
earlier
draft
in
the
house
that
specifically
provided
for
attorney’s
fees,
but
it
failed
and
the
bill
that
came
out
of
the
house
didn't
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
there
a
difference
between
the
elliott
draft
and
the
ultimate
landrum-griffin
bill?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
neither
dealt
with
attorney's
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
wasn't
that
one
of
the
reasons
the
court
used
to
distinguish
mills
from
fleischmann,
where
they
have
held
attorney’s
fees
weren't
permissible,
was
that
in
fleischmann
the
statute
had
provided
a
private
remedy,
whereas
in
mills,
the
court
had
to
imply
the
private
remedy,
and
therefore
was
free
to
also
imply
attendant
attributes
of
the
remedy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
unless
you
take
mills
where
it
didn't
specify
any
private
right
at
all,
i
mean,
isn't
--
this
is
really
somewhere
between
mills
and
fleischmann,
isn't
it?
