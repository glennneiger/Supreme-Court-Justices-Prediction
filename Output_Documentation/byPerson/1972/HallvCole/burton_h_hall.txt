mr.
burton
h.
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
to
go
back
to
the
facts
just
briefly
to
correct
what
i
believed
to
be
some
errors
in
my
friend’s
presentation.
mr.
cole
introduced
his
resolution
at
a
union
meeting
in
1962.
he
was
fully
in
order
to
introduce
it.
he
was
declared
to
be
in
order.
he
was
not
however
allowed
to
read
it.
it
was
read
in
a
verbal
fashion
by
one
of
the
officials
at
the
union.
the
head
of
the
union
then
took
the
floor
and
denounced
them
as
in
re
the
variety
of
other
bad
things.
he
wasn't
allowed
to
answer
it.
the
motion
was
put
to
a
vote,
he
and
his
seconder
were
the
only
ones
who
dared
to
put
up
their
hands
in
favor
of.
i
think
that
reveals
not
only
the
nature
of
how
these
unions
internal
affairs
have
been
run
in
recent
years.
it
also
reveals
the
nature
of
the
benefit
that
this
suit
has
conferred
upon
the
union
and
upon
the
membership.
according
to
the
union
officers
themselves,
those
officers
believed
and
they
say
they
believed
it
in
good
faith
and
there
has
been
a
finding
below
to
that
effect,
that
they
can
expel
a
member
who
introduces
a
resolution,
critical
of
them
at
a
union
meeting.
if
they
believed
it,
their
members
must
have
believed
it
also,
or
believes
they
were
not
secure
in
their
ordinary
democratic
rights,
guaranteed
them
by
the
bill
of
rights
title
of
this
act,
landrum-griffin
act.
this
was
already
three
years
after
the
landrum-griffin
act
had
gone
into
law.
it
was
more
than
four
years
after
the
state
of
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
have
declared
in
very
clear
language
that
public
policy
requires
that
union
members
be
protected
in
their
rights
to
express
views
and
opinions
critical
of
the
union's
leadership
and
its
offices,
even
when
the
criticism
is
hard-hitting
and
ardent.
despite
all
of
these,
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
union
was
represented,
and
is
represented
by
variable
counsel,
the
union
officers
insist
they
still
believe
they
could
freely
expel
a
man.
what's
more
they
must
have
believed
have
they
could
expel
them
on
no
evidence
or
whatsoever,
because
their
trail
committee
was
unable
to
find
any
evidence,
whatsoever
to
support
the
charges,
the
call
had
maliciously
vilified
the
union
president.
one
more
point
on
this,
the
resolution
was
critical
of
certain
violations
of
the
union’s
established
shipping
procedure
and
it
called
for
a
more
regularized
high
rank.
this
related
to
the
union’s
practice
or
the
union’s
officers
practice,
a
raiding
of
their
maritime
unions.
there
reason
it
related
is
rather
complicated.
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
picketing
that
the
union
carried
on
by
--
carries
on
from
time
to
time
by
membership
approvals,
the
officers
were
leading
men
in
what
was
called
voluntary
picketing.
and
rewarding
the
voluntary
--
which
involves
disputes
that
the
union
was
not
a
party
to
and
which
had
not
have
been
approved
by
the
union
membership.
he
was
rewarding
this
voluntary
picketing
by
giving
a
shipping
man
off
their
voluntary
picket
lines.
and
that
was
one
of
the
variations,
in
fact,
that
was
the
chief
variation
from
the
established
shipping
rules
that
mr.
cole
was
complaining
about.
his
motives
in
introducing
the
resolution
are
there
right
on
the
face
of
the
resolution.
mr.
cole
testified
as
to
his
motives,
and
it's
clear
his
motives
--
that
the
motives
that
he
testified
to
are
exactly
the
same
as
the
motives
that
are
indicated
by
the
resolution
itself.
namely
he
wanted
more
regularized
hiring,
and
he
wanted
to
end
this
doggy
dog
warfare
between
the
sister
unions,
where
you
are
one
union,
and
in
particular
this
union
would
raid
another
union
by
sending
strikebreakers
through
the
other
union’s
picket
lines,
by
offering
men
to
work
at
lower
wages
under
worst
conditions
than
the
other
union.
these
can
be
two
instances
he
has
here,
and
i
think
that
the
only
answer
is
--
the
only
instances
of
those
particular
practices
are
committed
by
this
union
i
believe,
against
the
others.
cole
wanted
to
stop
that,
because
he
wanted
better
conditions
for
all
say,
for
reasons
i
think
that
are
obvious.
he
was
brought
up
on
charges
by
the
court
agent
for
this,
charge
with
malicious
vilification
of
mr.
hall,
not
really,
we
have
no
relation
to
each
other.
he
was
put
through
this
deterrence
of
a
trial
committee
which
as
i
say,
he
could
find
no
evidence,
or
could
produce
in
its
report,
no
evidence
of
any
malicious
vilification
on
his
part,
or
other
violation
of
the
section
under
which
he
was
charged.
and
this
was
put
out
for
ratification
and
approved
by
the
members
voting
in
the
same
way
at
the
various
reports
by
hand
vote.
it
took
him
more
than
nine
years
to
get
this
far
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
he
was
rank
and
file
member,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
that's
right.
in
the
course
of
this
suit,
about
1966
or
1967,
he
suffered
a
board
ship,
a
back
injury
and
that's
why
he
is
now
retired,
he
was
not
able
to
work
anymore.
it
has
taken
him
more
than
nine
years
to
bring.
this
case
was
brought
in
december
of
1963.
it
has
gone
through
a
long
series
of
obstructive
i
think,
or
opposition
tactics
shall
we
say.
mr.
schulman
has
an
error
when
he
says
that
it
was
removed
from
the
calendar,
because
of
the
failure
to
observe
local
court
rules.
it
was
removed
from
the
trail
calendar
on
motion
of
defendant,
because
defendant
a
year
after
the
calendar
had
been
put
down
for
a
trial,
desired
to
serve
interrogatories.
the
actual
putting
it
down
on
for
trial
was
delayed
at
defendant’s
request,
because
they
had
said
that
they
wanted
to
serve
interrogatories.
no
interrogatories
were
served,
and
it
was
put
down
for
trial
i
think
the
day
before
a
calendar
order
would
have
been
gone
into
effect,
dismissing
the
case.
a
year
later,
the
defendant
came
for
his
195
interrogatories.
after
those
were
disposed
off,
the
defendant
demanded
depositions
of
the
plaintiff
and
from
thereon
it
went
to
trial.
it
has
been
on
request
to
court
of
appeals
twice,
once
on
the
preliminary
judgment,
and
the
second
on
this
instance
here.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
oh,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
getting
onto
the
real
meat
of
the
question
which
is
the
nature
of
the
court
of
appeal
--
the
power
of
the
court
inequity
to
award
attorney's
fees
where
the
doing
of
justice
requires.
i
would
suggest
that
this
case
is
on
off
force
with
mills
against
the
electric
auto
light
company.
in
fact,
it
would
be
almost
possible
to
strike
out
the
word
corporation
and
putting
the
word
union
and
have
the
identical
case
before
us.
in
mills,
certain
minority
stockholders
brought
the
suit
as
your
honors
know,
to
challenge
a
merger.
this
court’s
decision
did
not
decide
the
merger
question,
but
it
was
found
by
the
district
court
and
this
court
agreed,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
the
corporation
officers
to
send
out
non-misleading
information.
the
benefit
conferred
in
other
words
on
the
corporation,
and
its
members
by
the
mills
case
was
a
no-profit
benefit,
it
was
a
non-monetary
benefit.
it
was
the
benefit
of
fair
and
democratic
proceedings
within
the
corporation
just
as
the
benefit
which
mr.
cole
has
contributed
to
this
union
and
to
its
members,
is
the
guarantee
of
democratic
rights
on
the
part
of
those
union
members.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
believe
it
was
a
suit
to
challenge
a
merger
on
the
ground
that
the
--
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
believe
it
was
a
--
mr.
burton
h.
hall
it
rose
under
the
security’s
exchange
act,
under
a
guarantee
of
non
misleading
statements
to
be
sent
out
in
shareholder’s
votes.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
the
statute
did
provide
for
suit
in
other
sections,
and
it
provided
specifically
for
attorney’s
fees
in
other
sections.
i
believe
in
the
section
under
which
it
was
brought,
i
believe
section
14,
does
not
specifically
say
that
suit
can
be
brought.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
believe
there
are
two
distinctions,
and
were
two
distinctions
in
the
fleischmann
case
when
they
discussed
--
they
didn't
request,
fleischmann
did
not
discuss
mills.
i
am
thinking,
this
discussion
of
spraig
(ph),
but
i
am
tying
it
around
then
mills
discussion
or
fleischmann.
first
of
all,
fleischmann
was
not
such
a
suit
as
conferred
a
benefit
on
the
defendant
corporation
or
its
members.
there
was
no
way
in
fleischmann
that
a
fee
award
could
operate
so
as
to
spread
the
cost
of
the
litigation
among
the
person’s
benefit
by
the
litigation.
fleischmann
was
a
straight
trademark
case.
the
second
distinction
is,
that
one
year
that
counsel
is
referring
to,
is
the
fact
that
in
lanham
act
section
35,
suit
under
which
fleischmann
was
brought,
there
is
a
extremely
specific
and
intricate
statutory
scheme
for
relief.
the
statute
specifies
that
profits
may
be
obtained
in
addition
to
damages,
in
addition
to
costs.
it
spells
out
the
various
ways
in
which
the
profits
are
to
be
determined,
or
if
the
district
court
doesn't
find
the
actual
profits
that
are
adequate,
will
find
new
ones.
the
statute
has
prescribed
in
a
elaborate
detail,
in
fact,
in
the
landrum-griffin
act,
what
the
man
may
get
if
he
bring
suit.
here,
there
is
no
such
spelling
out.
there
is
simply
the
provision
by
the
statute
that
you
can
bring
a
suit
for
such
relief
as
maybe
appropriate.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
equivalent
of
saying
you
could
bring
suit,
obviously
the
court
gives
on
such
relief
as
it
deems
appropriate
and
it
would
be
impossible
i
think
for
congress
ever
to
specify
--
to
give
more
general
language,
to
indicate
a
more
general
intact
as
to
the
nature
of
the
relief
given,
and
then
it
has
in
section
102
of
the
landrum-griffin
act.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
somewhere
in
that
sentence;
i
believe
the
section
--
and
i
don't
have
the
section
as
i
see
that
clearly
in
my
mind
to
answer
very
specifically.
but
i
believe
the
right
of
a
cause
of
action
was
newly
discovered.
i
think
that's
about
as
far
as
that
point
can
be
put.
i
think
that
the
congress
intended
the
action.
so
my
recollection
in
section
18
is
much
more
clear
than
the
railway
labor
act,
inferred
guarantee
of
a
right
to
sue
for
a
fair
representation.
i
believe
that
there
is
statutory
indication,
that
for
instance,
an
action
done
in
violation
of
the
requirement
about
non-misleading
information
would
be
void.
and
this
only
would
be
actionable
to
make
it
void.
but
i
can't
–
i
have
to
retreat,
because
i
don't
know
if
that
was
statutory.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
501(b)
is
a
suit
involving
fiduciary
--
it
is
a
section
involving
the
--
no,
501(a)
imposes
a
fiduciary
duty
on
officials
and
501(b)
is
a
suit
obtained
for
the
benefit
of
the
union,
relief
for
breach
of
the
fiduciary
duty.
it
does
not
give
to
my
mind
general
equitable
powers
to
the
court.
what's
more
the
nature
of
the
suit,
contemplated
in
501(b),
is
such
that
there
would
be
no
fee
award
in
the
sense
of
award-payable
by
the
defendant
as
such,
rather
501(b)
talks
about
division
of
the
monies
recovered
for
the
benefit
and
beyond.
i
believe
the
set
operative
language
is,
the
district
court
may
allocate
a
portion
of
the
recovery
for
the
plaintiff
–
for
counsel
fees.
the
district
court's
power,
and
probably
i
would
suggest
it
does
have
the
power
in
the
501(b)
suit
to
award
counsel
fees
in
addition,
would
not
come
out
of
that
clause
as
i
understand,
but
would
come
out
of
the
fact
that
perhaps
that
the
amount
recovered
was
not
sufficient,
and
it
was
necessary
to
give
counsel
the
award.
there
is
another
distinction
between
the
section,
i
didn't
mean
to
jump
into
it
in
the
middle
this
way,
that
the
two
sections
which
specify
attorney’s
fees
awards
in
the
landrum-griffin
act
are
the
only
sections
which
specifically
say
that
suit
could
be
brought
in
state
as
well
as
in
federal
court.
now,
the
power
of
a
court
of
inequity
to
award
counsel
fees
has
been
essentially
a
federal
matter.
the
states
are
various
in
their
views
on
that
question,
and
it
is
i
believe
possible
that
the
congress
may
have
had
in
mind,
a
desire
to
make
clear
to
all
the
state
jurisdictions
that
counsel
fees
are
properly
awardable
under
the
two
sections,
one
is
201(c),
and
the
other
which
relates
to
accounting
a
bill
of
assets
and
so
on,
and
then
the
other
is
the
501(b)
that
we
have
been
talking
about.
the
history
of
the
act
indicates
very
clearly
that
the
desire,
that
many
people
in
congress,
and
certainly
the
ultimate
drafters
of
the
act
felt
very
strongly
that
counsel
fees
should
be
awardable
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
senator
goldwater
was
extremely
outspoken
on
the
question,
as
mr.
schulman
has
commented.
he
apparently
at
first
thought
that
the
senate
bill
or
that
the
title
i
as
it
came
out
of
the
senate,
did
not
provide
adequate
guarantee
that
there
would
be
counsel
fees.
so
he
testified
–
so
he
voted
against
the
bill,
he
was
the
only
senator
who
did.
he
wanted
in
that
initial
time
that
came
up
in
the
senate
and
so
he
urged
some
other
kind
of
provision
in
the
house
bill.
the
house
had
before
it,
not
the
senate
bill
directly
but
the
elliot
bill,
and
the
elliot
bill
was
somewhat
different
in
its
language.
i
have
quoted
the
operative
language
on
page
31
of
my
brief.
i
would
suggest
that
although
as
congressman
elliot
indicates,
he
intended
very
general
relief
by
that
provision,
that
in
a
style
in
which
it's
written,
would
suggest
to
somewhat
flabbier
approach
to
the
powers
of
the
court
it
comes
before.
that
at
least
must
be
the
opinion
of
the
nine
republican
members
of
the
house
committee.
those
nine
members,
and
they
included
congressman
griffin,
submitted
a
set
of
dissenting
view
of
the
minority
report
to
the
house
report
on
the
elliot
bill.
they
started
it
by
saying,
“we
the
undersigned
members
of
the
committee
are
convinced
beyond
doubt
that
h.r.
8342,
that's
the
elliot
bill,
in
its
present
form
is
woefully
inadequate
as
a
means
of
dealing
with
corruption
and
racketeering
in
the
labor
management
field.”
down
further
on
their
dissenting
views
as
it
becomes
clear,
that
they
are
talking
in
large
part
about
the
bill
of
rights,
which
they
say
has
(inaudible)
down
along
with
the
elimination
of
adequate
enforcement
provisions.
that's
their
principle
--
that's
the
first
reason
given
for
saying
that
the
elliot
bill
is
inadequate.
then
they
had
to
come
around
specifically
and
they
talk
about
counsel
fees,
they
say,
“one
of
the
most
serious
inadequacy,”
now
they
refer
to
the
senate
bill
for
reasons
which
i
would
suggest
are
something
in
a
terminological
error
here,
“is
the
lack
of
any
infective
enforcement
procedure
to
infect
--
to
protect
the
union
members
from
those
few
union
officials
who
fail
to
recognize
that
the
union
belongs
to
its
members
and
so
on.”
and
they
emphasize
that
there
must
be
counsel
fees
awardable.
then
at
the
end
of
their
descending
views,
they
say
very
clearly,
“that
because
of
these
inadequacies,
we,
us
nine
people,
we
are
going
to
oppose
this
bill,
and
we
intend
to
support
the
landrum-griffin
bill
when
it
comes
up
on
the
house
floor.”
now
in
fact,
they
did
support
the
landrum-griffin
bill.
in
fact,
one
of
these
was
mr.
griffin
and
the
landrum-griffin
bill
replaced
the
elliot
bill.
that
is
it
replaced
the
text.
the
entire
text
of
the
elliot
bill
after
the
enacting
clause
was
deleted
and
the
text
of
the
landrum-griffin
put
in.
i
would
submit
that
the
very
least,
those
statements
by
mr.
griffin
and
by
the
other
eight
minority
people
indicate
that
when
they
pushed
for
the
landrum-griffin
bill,
they
were
pushing
for
language
which
they
believed
would
be
adequate
which
would
guarantee
counsel
fees
to
union
members,
which
would
be
adequate
in
other
words
to
meet
the
problem
of
corruption
and
racketeering
in
the
unions.
whether
or
not
the
elliot
bill
really
was
inadequate,
of
course
is
a
dispute
between
them
and
mr.
elliot.
mr.
elliot
believed
that
it
gave
wide
relief
at
the
language
that
he
had
to
drawn
up
gave
wide
latitude
to
grant
relief
according
to
the
necessities
of
the
case.
they
disagreed
and
so
they
opposed
mr.
eliot’s
bill
and
they
put
in
their
own
and
their
own
is
virtually
identical
except
for
few
additions
like
the
parenthetical
phrase,
including
injunctions
with
the
act
as
presently
adopted.
i
would
suggest
that
as
far
as
mr.
goldwater,
senator
goldwater’s
criticisms
are
concerned,
senator
goldwater
on
reflection
must
have
concluded
that
the
language
of
the
senate
bill,
because
the
language
of
the
senate
bill
was
identical
with
the
language
of
the
landrum-griffin
was
after
all
sufficient,
that
its
generality
did
give
courts
power
to
grant
equitable
relief
including
attorney’s
fees.
nothing
at
least
more
was
said
on
the
matter
and
it
came
before
the
senate
again.
and
my
recollection
is
although
i
can't
say
definite
or
certainty
that
senator
goldwater
ultimately
voted
for
it.
i
think
if
you
are
to
conclude
as
my
friend
would
that
these
congressmen
and
senators
did
not
intend
their
final
bill
to
give
attorney’s
fees
and
they
deliberately,
then
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
they
deliberately
pushed
the
bill
which
they
believe
to
be
inadequate
which
would
not
meet
the
needs
that
were
called
for
to
combat
corruption
and
racketeering.
i
would
suggest
that
implies
a
kind
of
machiavellianism
that
should
not
be
assumed
and
they
should
not
be
accused
of
unless
there
is
something
more
suggestive.
i
think
one
must
draw
from
the
gentlest
overall
history
that
these
congressmen
and
senators
wanted
attorney’s
fees
to
be
available,
they
said
so.
they
felt
that
it
would
--
any
bill
which
failed
to
make
them
available
would
be
woefully
inadequate
and
so
they
chose
language
which
on
reflection
and
study
was
sufficient
to
make
an
attorney’s
fee
awardable
under
ordinary
equitable
principles.
thank
you.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
to
go
back
to
the
facts
just
briefly
to
correct
what
i
believed
to
be
some
errors
in
my
friend’s
presentation.
mr.
cole
introduced
his
resolution
at
a
union
meeting
in
1962.
he
was
fully
in
order
to
introduce
it.
he
was
declared
to
be
in
order.
he
was
not
however
allowed
to
read
it.
it
was
read
in
a
verbal
fashion
by
one
of
the
officials
at
the
union.
the
head
of
the
union
then
took
the
floor
and
denounced
them
as
in
re
the
variety
of
other
bad
things.
he
wasn't
allowed
to
answer
it.
the
motion
was
put
to
a
vote,
he
and
his
seconder
were
the
only
ones
who
dared
to
put
up
their
hands
in
favor
of.
i
think
that
reveals
not
only
the
nature
of
how
these
unions
internal
affairs
have
been
run
in
recent
years.
it
also
reveals
the
nature
of
the
benefit
that
this
suit
has
conferred
upon
the
union
and
upon
the
membership.
according
to
the
union
officers
themselves,
those
officers
believed
and
they
say
they
believed
it
in
good
faith
and
there
has
been
a
finding
below
to
that
effect,
that
they
can
expel
a
member
who
introduces
a
resolution,
critical
of
them
at
a
union
meeting.
if
they
believed
it,
their
members
must
have
believed
it
also,
or
believes
they
were
not
secure
in
their
ordinary
democratic
rights,
guaranteed
them
by
the
bill
of
rights
title
of
this
act,
landrum-griffin
act.
this
was
already
three
years
after
the
landrum-griffin
act
had
gone
into
law.
it
was
more
than
four
years
after
the
state
of
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
have
declared
in
very
clear
language
that
public
policy
requires
that
union
members
be
protected
in
their
rights
to
express
views
and
opinions
critical
of
the
union's
leadership
and
its
offices,
even
when
the
criticism
is
hard-hitting
and
ardent.
despite
all
of
these,
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
union
was
represented,
and
is
represented
by
variable
counsel,
the
union
officers
insist
they
still
believe
they
could
freely
expel
a
man.
what's
more
they
must
have
believed
have
they
could
expel
them
on
no
evidence
or
whatsoever,
because
their
trail
committee
was
unable
to
find
any
evidence,
whatsoever
to
support
the
charges,
the
call
had
maliciously
vilified
the
union
president.
one
more
point
on
this,
the
resolution
was
critical
of
certain
violations
of
the
union’s
established
shipping
procedure
and
it
called
for
a
more
regularized
high
rank.
this
related
to
the
union’s
practice
or
the
union’s
officers
practice,
a
raiding
of
their
maritime
unions.
there
reason
it
related
is
rather
complicated.
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
picketing
that
the
union
carried
on
by
--
carries
on
from
time
to
time
by
membership
approvals,
the
officers
were
leading
men
in
what
was
called
voluntary
picketing.
and
rewarding
the
voluntary
--
which
involves
disputes
that
the
union
was
not
a
party
to
and
which
had
not
have
been
approved
by
the
union
membership.
he
was
rewarding
this
voluntary
picketing
by
giving
a
shipping
man
off
their
voluntary
picket
lines.
and
that
was
one
of
the
variations,
in
fact,
that
was
the
chief
variation
from
the
established
shipping
rules
that
mr.
cole
was
complaining
about.
his
motives
in
introducing
the
resolution
are
there
right
on
the
face
of
the
resolution.
mr.
cole
testified
as
to
his
motives,
and
it's
clear
his
motives
--
that
the
motives
that
he
testified
to
are
exactly
the
same
as
the
motives
that
are
indicated
by
the
resolution
itself.
namely
he
wanted
more
regularized
hiring,
and
he
wanted
to
end
this
doggy
dog
warfare
between
the
sister
unions,
where
you
are
one
union,
and
in
particular
this
union
would
raid
another
union
by
sending
strikebreakers
through
the
other
union’s
picket
lines,
by
offering
men
to
work
at
lower
wages
under
worst
conditions
than
the
other
union.
these
can
be
two
instances
he
has
here,
and
i
think
that
the
only
answer
is
--
the
only
instances
of
those
particular
practices
are
committed
by
this
union
i
believe,
against
the
others.
cole
wanted
to
stop
that,
because
he
wanted
better
conditions
for
all
say,
for
reasons
i
think
that
are
obvious.
he
was
brought
up
on
charges
by
the
court
agent
for
this,
charge
with
malicious
vilification
of
mr.
hall,
not
really,
we
have
no
relation
to
each
other.
he
was
put
through
this
deterrence
of
a
trial
committee
which
as
i
say,
he
could
find
no
evidence,
or
could
produce
in
its
report,
no
evidence
of
any
malicious
vilification
on
his
part,
or
other
violation
of
the
section
under
which
he
was
charged.
and
this
was
put
out
for
ratification
and
approved
by
the
members
voting
in
the
same
way
at
the
various
reports
by
hand
vote.
it
took
him
more
than
nine
years
to
get
this
far
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
he
was
rank
and
file
member,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
that's
right.
in
the
course
of
this
suit,
about
1966
or
1967,
he
suffered
a
board
ship,
a
back
injury
and
that's
why
he
is
now
retired,
he
was
not
able
to
work
anymore.
it
has
taken
him
more
than
nine
years
to
bring.
this
case
was
brought
in
december
of
1963.
it
has
gone
through
a
long
series
of
obstructive
i
think,
or
opposition
tactics
shall
we
say.
mr.
schulman
has
an
error
when
he
says
that
it
was
removed
from
the
calendar,
because
of
the
failure
to
observe
local
court
rules.
it
was
removed
from
the
trail
calendar
on
motion
of
defendant,
because
defendant
a
year
after
the
calendar
had
been
put
down
for
a
trial,
desired
to
serve
interrogatories.
the
actual
putting
it
down
on
for
trial
was
delayed
at
defendant’s
request,
because
they
had
said
that
they
wanted
to
serve
interrogatories.
no
interrogatories
were
served,
and
it
was
put
down
for
trial
i
think
the
day
before
a
calendar
order
would
have
been
gone
into
effect,
dismissing
the
case.
a
year
later,
the
defendant
came
for
his
195
interrogatories.
after
those
were
disposed
off,
the
defendant
demanded
depositions
of
the
plaintiff
and
from
thereon
it
went
to
trial.
it
has
been
on
request
to
court
of
appeals
twice,
once
on
the
preliminary
judgment,
and
the
second
on
this
instance
here.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
oh,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
getting
onto
the
real
meat
of
the
question
which
is
the
nature
of
the
court
of
appeal
--
the
power
of
the
court
inequity
to
award
attorney's
fees
where
the
doing
of
justice
requires.
i
would
suggest
that
this
case
is
on
off
force
with
mills
against
the
electric
auto
light
company.
in
fact,
it
would
be
almost
possible
to
strike
out
the
word
corporation
and
putting
the
word
union
and
have
the
identical
case
before
us.
in
mills,
certain
minority
stockholders
brought
the
suit
as
your
honors
know,
to
challenge
a
merger.
this
court’s
decision
did
not
decide
the
merger
question,
but
it
was
found
by
the
district
court
and
this
court
agreed,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
the
corporation
officers
to
send
out
non-misleading
information.
the
benefit
conferred
in
other
words
on
the
corporation,
and
its
members
by
the
mills
case
was
a
no-profit
benefit,
it
was
a
non-monetary
benefit.
it
was
the
benefit
of
fair
and
democratic
proceedings
within
the
corporation
just
as
the
benefit
which
mr.
cole
has
contributed
to
this
union
and
to
its
members,
is
the
guarantee
of
democratic
rights
on
the
part
of
those
union
members.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
believe
it
was
a
suit
to
challenge
a
merger
on
the
ground
that
the
--
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
believe
it
was
a
--
mr.
burton
h.
hall
it
rose
under
the
security’s
exchange
act,
under
a
guarantee
of
non
misleading
statements
to
be
sent
out
in
shareholder’s
votes.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
the
statute
did
provide
for
suit
in
other
sections,
and
it
provided
specifically
for
attorney’s
fees
in
other
sections.
i
believe
in
the
section
under
which
it
was
brought,
i
believe
section
14,
does
not
specifically
say
that
suit
can
be
brought.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
believe
there
are
two
distinctions,
and
were
two
distinctions
in
the
fleischmann
case
when
they
discussed
--
they
didn't
request,
fleischmann
did
not
discuss
mills.
i
am
thinking,
this
discussion
of
spraig
(ph),
but
i
am
tying
it
around
then
mills
discussion
or
fleischmann.
first
of
all,
fleischmann
was
not
such
a
suit
as
conferred
a
benefit
on
the
defendant
corporation
or
its
members.
there
was
no
way
in
fleischmann
that
a
fee
award
could
operate
so
as
to
spread
the
cost
of
the
litigation
among
the
person’s
benefit
by
the
litigation.
fleischmann
was
a
straight
trademark
case.
the
second
distinction
is,
that
one
year
that
counsel
is
referring
to,
is
the
fact
that
in
lanham
act
section
35,
suit
under
which
fleischmann
was
brought,
there
is
a
extremely
specific
and
intricate
statutory
scheme
for
relief.
the
statute
specifies
that
profits
may
be
obtained
in
addition
to
damages,
in
addition
to
costs.
it
spells
out
the
various
ways
in
which
the
profits
are
to
be
determined,
or
if
the
district
court
doesn't
find
the
actual
profits
that
are
adequate,
will
find
new
ones.
the
statute
has
prescribed
in
a
elaborate
detail,
in
fact,
in
the
landrum-griffin
act,
what
the
man
may
get
if
he
bring
suit.
here,
there
is
no
such
spelling
out.
there
is
simply
the
provision
by
the
statute
that
you
can
bring
a
suit
for
such
relief
as
maybe
appropriate.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
equivalent
of
saying
you
could
bring
suit,
obviously
the
court
gives
on
such
relief
as
it
deems
appropriate
and
it
would
be
impossible
i
think
for
congress
ever
to
specify
--
to
give
more
general
language,
to
indicate
a
more
general
intact
as
to
the
nature
of
the
relief
given,
and
then
it
has
in
section
102
of
the
landrum-griffin
act.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
somewhere
in
that
sentence;
i
believe
the
section
--
and
i
don't
have
the
section
as
i
see
that
clearly
in
my
mind
to
answer
very
specifically.
but
i
believe
the
right
of
a
cause
of
action
was
newly
discovered.
i
think
that's
about
as
far
as
that
point
can
be
put.
i
think
that
the
congress
intended
the
action.
so
my
recollection
in
section
18
is
much
more
clear
than
the
railway
labor
act,
inferred
guarantee
of
a
right
to
sue
for
a
fair
representation.
i
believe
that
there
is
statutory
indication,
that
for
instance,
an
action
done
in
violation
of
the
requirement
about
non-misleading
information
would
be
void.
and
this
only
would
be
actionable
to
make
it
void.
but
i
can't
–
i
have
to
retreat,
because
i
don't
know
if
that
was
statutory.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
501(b)
is
a
suit
involving
fiduciary
--
it
is
a
section
involving
the
--
no,
501(a)
imposes
a
fiduciary
duty
on
officials
and
501(b)
is
a
suit
obtained
for
the
benefit
of
the
union,
relief
for
breach
of
the
fiduciary
duty.
it
does
not
give
to
my
mind
general
equitable
powers
to
the
court.
what's
more
the
nature
of
the
suit,
contemplated
in
501(b),
is
such
that
there
would
be
no
fee
award
in
the
sense
of
award-payable
by
the
defendant
as
such,
rather
501(b)
talks
about
division
of
the
monies
recovered
for
the
benefit
and
beyond.
i
believe
the
set
operative
language
is,
the
district
court
may
allocate
a
portion
of
the
recovery
for
the
plaintiff
–
for
counsel
fees.
the
district
court's
power,
and
probably
i
would
suggest
it
does
have
the
power
in
the
501(b)
suit
to
award
counsel
fees
in
addition,
would
not
come
out
of
that
clause
as
i
understand,
but
would
come
out
of
the
fact
that
perhaps
that
the
amount
recovered
was
not
sufficient,
and
it
was
necessary
to
give
counsel
the
award.
there
is
another
distinction
between
the
section,
i
didn't
mean
to
jump
into
it
in
the
middle
this
way,
that
the
two
sections
which
specify
attorney’s
fees
awards
in
the
landrum-griffin
act
are
the
only
sections
which
specifically
say
that
suit
could
be
brought
in
state
as
well
as
in
federal
court.
now,
the
power
of
a
court
of
inequity
to
award
counsel
fees
has
been
essentially
a
federal
matter.
the
states
are
various
in
their
views
on
that
question,
and
it
is
i
believe
possible
that
the
congress
may
have
had
in
mind,
a
desire
to
make
clear
to
all
the
state
jurisdictions
that
counsel
fees
are
properly
awardable
under
the
two
sections,
one
is
201(c),
and
the
other
which
relates
to
accounting
a
bill
of
assets
and
so
on,
and
then
the
other
is
the
501(b)
that
we
have
been
talking
about.
the
history
of
the
act
indicates
very
clearly
that
the
desire,
that
many
people
in
congress,
and
certainly
the
ultimate
drafters
of
the
act
felt
very
strongly
that
counsel
fees
should
be
awardable
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
senator
goldwater
was
extremely
outspoken
on
the
question,
as
mr.
schulman
has
commented.
he
apparently
at
first
thought
that
the
senate
bill
or
that
the
title
i
as
it
came
out
of
the
senate,
did
not
provide
adequate
guarantee
that
there
would
be
counsel
fees.
so
he
testified
–
so
he
voted
against
the
bill,
he
was
the
only
senator
who
did.
he
wanted
in
that
initial
time
that
came
up
in
the
senate
and
so
he
urged
some
other
kind
of
provision
in
the
house
bill.
the
house
had
before
it,
not
the
senate
bill
directly
but
the
elliot
bill,
and
the
elliot
bill
was
somewhat
different
in
its
language.
i
have
quoted
the
operative
language
on
page
31
of
my
brief.
i
would
suggest
that
although
as
congressman
elliot
indicates,
he
intended
very
general
relief
by
that
provision,
that
in
a
style
in
which
it's
written,
would
suggest
to
somewhat
flabbier
approach
to
the
powers
of
the
court
it
comes
before.
that
at
least
must
be
the
opinion
of
the
nine
republican
members
of
the
house
committee.
those
nine
members,
and
they
included
congressman
griffin,
submitted
a
set
of
dissenting
view
of
the
minority
report
to
the
house
report
on
the
elliot
bill.
they
started
it
by
saying,
“we
the
undersigned
members
of
the
committee
are
convinced
beyond
doubt
that
h.r.
8342,
that's
the
elliot
bill,
in
its
present
form
is
woefully
inadequate
as
a
means
of
dealing
with
corruption
and
racketeering
in
the
labor
management
field.”
down
further
on
their
dissenting
views
as
it
becomes
clear,
that
they
are
talking
in
large
part
about
the
bill
of
rights,
which
they
say
has
(inaudible)
down
along
with
the
elimination
of
adequate
enforcement
provisions.
that's
their
principle
--
that's
the
first
reason
given
for
saying
that
the
elliot
bill
is
inadequate.
then
they
had
to
come
around
specifically
and
they
talk
about
counsel
fees,
they
say,
“one
of
the
most
serious
inadequacy,”
now
they
refer
to
the
senate
bill
for
reasons
which
i
would
suggest
are
something
in
a
terminological
error
here,
“is
the
lack
of
any
infective
enforcement
procedure
to
infect
--
to
protect
the
union
members
from
those
few
union
officials
who
fail
to
recognize
that
the
union
belongs
to
its
members
and
so
on.”
and
they
emphasize
that
there
must
be
counsel
fees
awardable.
then
at
the
end
of
their
descending
views,
they
say
very
clearly,
“that
because
of
these
inadequacies,
we,
us
nine
people,
we
are
going
to
oppose
this
bill,
and
we
intend
to
support
the
landrum-griffin
bill
when
it
comes
up
on
the
house
floor.”
now
in
fact,
they
did
support
the
landrum-griffin
bill.
in
fact,
one
of
these
was
mr.
griffin
and
the
landrum-griffin
bill
replaced
the
elliot
bill.
that
is
it
replaced
the
text.
the
entire
text
of
the
elliot
bill
after
the
enacting
clause
was
deleted
and
the
text
of
the
landrum-griffin
put
in.
i
would
submit
that
the
very
least,
those
statements
by
mr.
griffin
and
by
the
other
eight
minority
people
indicate
that
when
they
pushed
for
the
landrum-griffin
bill,
they
were
pushing
for
language
which
they
believed
would
be
adequate
which
would
guarantee
counsel
fees
to
union
members,
which
would
be
adequate
in
other
words
to
meet
the
problem
of
corruption
and
racketeering
in
the
unions.
whether
or
not
the
elliot
bill
really
was
inadequate,
of
course
is
a
dispute
between
them
and
mr.
elliot.
mr.
elliot
believed
that
it
gave
wide
relief
at
the
language
that
he
had
to
drawn
up
gave
wide
latitude
to
grant
relief
according
to
the
necessities
of
the
case.
they
disagreed
and
so
they
opposed
mr.
eliot’s
bill
and
they
put
in
their
own
and
their
own
is
virtually
identical
except
for
few
additions
like
the
parenthetical
phrase,
including
injunctions
with
the
act
as
presently
adopted.
i
would
suggest
that
as
far
as
mr.
goldwater,
senator
goldwater’s
criticisms
are
concerned,
senator
goldwater
on
reflection
must
have
concluded
that
the
language
of
the
senate
bill,
because
the
language
of
the
senate
bill
was
identical
with
the
language
of
the
landrum-griffin
was
after
all
sufficient,
that
its
generality
did
give
courts
power
to
grant
equitable
relief
including
attorney’s
fees.
nothing
at
least
more
was
said
on
the
matter
and
it
came
before
the
senate
again.
and
my
recollection
is
although
i
can't
say
definite
or
certainty
that
senator
goldwater
ultimately
voted
for
it.
i
think
if
you
are
to
conclude
as
my
friend
would
that
these
congressmen
and
senators
did
not
intend
their
final
bill
to
give
attorney’s
fees
and
they
deliberately,
then
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
they
deliberately
pushed
the
bill
which
they
believe
to
be
inadequate
which
would
not
meet
the
needs
that
were
called
for
to
combat
corruption
and
racketeering.
i
would
suggest
that
implies
a
kind
of
machiavellianism
that
should
not
be
assumed
and
they
should
not
be
accused
of
unless
there
is
something
more
suggestive.
i
think
one
must
draw
from
the
gentlest
overall
history
that
these
congressmen
and
senators
wanted
attorney’s
fees
to
be
available,
they
said
so.
they
felt
that
it
would
--
any
bill
which
failed
to
make
them
available
would
be
woefully
inadequate
and
so
they
chose
language
which
on
reflection
and
study
was
sufficient
to
make
an
attorney’s
fee
awardable
under
ordinary
equitable
principles.
thank
you.
