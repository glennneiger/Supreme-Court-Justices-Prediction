mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
question
is
added
here
is
whether
a
method
for
converting
electrical
signals
in
an
electrical
data
processing
machine
that
signals
that
represent
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
into
pure
binary
numbers
is
a
patentable
invention
under
section
101
of
the
statute.
the
only
issue
seems
to
be
an
issue
of
subject
matter.
the
claims
were
not
rejected
in
the
patent
office
on
any
grounds
of
utility,
novelty
or
business.
those
points
weren’t
raised
or
decided
in
the
court
below
as
i
understood
in
argument
for
counsel
for
the
commissioner
this
morning,
he
is
not
raising
in
those
points
in
this
court.
so
that
i
submit
the
question
of
subject
matter
has
to
be
considered
on
the
assumption
that
these
claims
are
useful,
noble,
and
non-obvious.
and
i
should
like
to
begin
by
saying
a
word
about
the
background
with
the
nature
of
this
invention.
the
respondents
here
have
made
the
invention
because
they
were
working
on
what
was
essentially
a
machine
problem
and
they
saw
the
problem
by
inventing
a
machine
method.
they
were
working
on
a
pbx
and
i
think
the
pbx
as
i
assume
all,
everyone
knows
is
a
switching
device
that
connects
a
group
of
telephones
one
to
the
other
and
also
connects
those
telephones
with
outside
telephones.
it’s
used
in
a
hotel
for
example,
connect
all
phones
in
the
hotel
in
all
zones
and
outside
phones
to
use
the
same
way
in
an
office.
now,
one
of
the
elements
of
this
switching
device
was
a
control
unit
which
was
a
kind
of
digital
computer.
it
received
electrical
impulses
around
the
telephone
making
the
call
by
electrical
impulses
that
identified
the
telephone
that
was
being
called
and
then
it
connected
the
two
telephones.
now,
to
carry
out
to
this
function
it
was
necessary
in
that
control
unit
to
convert
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
(bcd)
numbers
into
pure
binary
numbers.
what
the
respondents
are
working
on
this
problem
there
were
numbers
of
quite
a
number
of
known
ways
of
converting
bcd
numbers
into
binary
numbers.
but
all
of
these
ways
were
unsatisfactory
simply
because
of
the
physical
limitations
of
the
computer
was
which
the
respondents
were
working.
some
of
the
message
required
storage
over
in
that
computer
of
elaborate
cables
of
conversion
of
values
and
then
circuits
to
do
what
is
called
multi-digit
adding.
some
of
them
required
others
special
circuits
to
perform
special
functions.
now
the
computer
at
least
that
the
respondents
are
working
with
didn’t
have
storage
capacity.
it
didn’t
have
multi-digit
adding
circuits.
it
didn’t
have
these
others
special
circuits.
so
their
problem
was
to
find
a
method
of
converting
bcd
numbers
into
binary
numbers
that
was
to
be
consistent
and
feasible
and
efficient
within
the
terms
of
the
physical
limitations
of
this
computer
that
they’re
working
with.
and
they
discovered
such
a
method.
now,
we’ve
described
the
method
in
our
brief
and
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
briefly
simply
will
say
this
it
consists
of
processing
a
bcd
number
in
a
series
of
repetitive
cycles
and
do
this
to
the
electrical
impulses
in
the
machine
and
each
cycle
and
electrical
impulse
is
detected,
discovered
by
another
electrical
impulse,
its
canceled
and
then
two
electrical
impulses
are
inserted
in
pre-designated
places
in
the
original
sequence
of
impulses
that
you
are
converting.
and
when
you
have
done
that
for
each
signal
in
the
bcd,
series
of
signals
under
this
process,
you
then
obtain
a
series
of
signals
which
have
a
representational
value
that
is
equivalent
in
binary
to
the
representational
value
in
bcd
with
which
you
stock.
now,
in
discovering
and
inventing
this
method
the
respondents
detected
that
there
was
a
mathematical
relationship
that
would
be
useful
and
i
am
emphasize
that
because
the
important
thing
here
is
the
recognition
that
this
relationship,
this
mathematical
relationship
could
be
useful
in
devising
a
machine
method
that
would
solve
their
problem
and
by
the
result
of
that
recognition
may
devised
this
simple
method
of
carrying
out
this
operation
and
it
had
great
advantages
of
course
for
them
that
made
it
possible
for
this
computer
they
were
working
with
to
do
something
that
it
couldn’t
do
before.
and
it
has
advantages
for
any
digital
computer,
even
though
it
has
more
elaborate
equipment
in
the
equipment
in
that
computer
with
which
they
were
working,
it
reduces
a
number
of
signals
in
the
amount
of
circuitry
you
have
to
use
and
that
reduces
a
possibility
of
errors
through
circuit
malfunction
which
sometimes
happens.
it
means
that
you
don’t
have
to
use
a
lot
of
storage
space
in
the
computer
even
if
you
have
which
is
often
a
convenience
if
necessary.
now,
as
i’ve
said
and
it
sorted,
it
has
advantages,
substantial,
synergistic
advantages
in
any
kind
of
a
digital
computer.
now,
as
i
have
said,
they
were
able
to
do
to
make
devised
this
method
because
they
recognized
that
this
mathematical
relationship
could
be
used
to
advantage
in
a
machine
in
converting
this
bcd
rapper
signals
its
impulses
and
the
impulses
representing
pure
binary
numbers.
but
the
fact
in
claim
is
on
the
machine
method
and
not
on
the
mathematics.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
point
because
it’s
a
confusion
that
seems
to
me
to
run
through
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
here.
there
are
two
claims
in
this
case.
they
were
both
rejected
by
the
patent
office
on
the
ground
and
the
sole
ground
that
they
represented
mental
or
they
we
don’t
have
to
claim
mental
processors
and
mathematical
steps.
the
court
below
have
reversed
holding
that
they
were
claims
on
the
machine
--
on
the
machine
method
that
we
submit
to
the
court
below
was
right.
we’ve
discussed
the
language
of
those
can’t
--
claims
of
great
lengths
in
our
brief.
i
don’t
propose
that
we
tread
that
discussion
here,
i
will
simply
say
this.
but
i
think
they’re
really
isn’t
any
room
for
argument
about
claim
8.
it’s
stated
in
terms
of
a
machine
method
no
one
would
describe
anything
else
in
the
terms
of
used
in
that
claim
and
the
government,
the
petitioner
doesn’t
really
argue
that
there’s
any
doubt
that
that
claim
is
confined
to
a
method
to
be
practice
on
an
electrical
data
processing
machine
computer.
they
make
some
arguments
about
claim
13,
we
think
those
arguments
are
wrong.
we
think
when
the
claim
is
read
as
a
whole
and
in
the
context
it
too
like
claim
8,
simply
claims
a
method
that
is
to
be
practice
on
an
electrical
data
processing
machine.
but
whether
there
is
merit
in
those
arguments
are
not
they
can’t
--
they
don’t
apply
to
claim
8
because
they
depend
upon
the
language
of
claim
13,
claim
8
stands
on
an
independent
basis.
now,
i
should
like
now
to
examine
the
reasons
of
the
petitioner
here
argues
the
same
that
this
machine
method
is
not
covering,
not
patentable
subject
matter
under
section
101
of
the
statute.
i
don’t
really
think
that
petitioner
is
relying
in
any
of
degree
on
the
conventional
patent
law
doctrine
about
mental
steps.
he
said
this
morning
that
the
computer
doesn’t
think
and
i
supposed
there’s
no
about
that
when
this
method
is
practiced,
it
is
a
practice
for
manipulating
electrical
signals
and
when
the
steps
describe
in
the
claims
are
taken
signals
are
detected,
blanked
out,
transferred,
inserted
in
other
places.
it
is
a
mechanical
operation.
the
rule
against
patenting
mental
steps
is
simply
a
rule
that
you
can’t
patent
something,
that
goes
on
the
line
and
the
respondents
here
are
not
attempted
to
do
that.
these
claims
are
confined
of
the
steps
that
take
place
in
a
machine.
i
think
what
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
they
might
ask.
i
think
they
will
be
in
trouble.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
they
--
i
say
--
i
have
taken
your
word
in
troubles
because
i
think
that
you
would
raised
in
a
serious
questions.
i
think
there
is
a
rule
and
probably
a
sensible
rule
that
you
cannot
get
a
patent
on
something
that
goes
on
simply
in
the
mind.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
there
would
be
a
serious
question
there
because
i
would
doubt
whether
they
have
would
have
made
the
specific
application
over
other
than
a
useful
arts.
see
there’s
a
very
old
doctrine
that
i
am
going
to
say
something
about
that
moment
about
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
would.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
but
the
trouble
with
it
mr.
justice
white
i
think
would
be
in
position
rather
of
arguing
on
the
other
side
of
this
but
the
trouble
would
be
that
make
specific
application
of
the
--
of
the
thing
of
useful
arts
of
claim
may
be
so
broad
as
to
preclude
any
use
of
the
formula
told
by
even
for
purposes
of
a
speculation
or
thought
or
something
of
that
kind
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
basis
use
the
old
rule
that
you
can’t
--
you
can’t
patent
a
natural
law
as
such
or
a
principle
as
such
question.
respondents
here
haven’t
tried
to
do
that.
but
i
think
there
would
be
if
they
had
--
if
this
patent
claims
simply
read,
“we
patent
this
method
of
converting
numbers,”
i
think
that
it
would
be
an
arguable
question
whether
they
will
be
patentable.
but
it
isn’t
here
that
question
isn’t
here.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
wouldn’t
have
any
case
at
all
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
question
isn’t
here
because
respondents
here
haven’t
made
that
kind
of
a
claim,
mr.
justice
white.
they
have
only
claimed
the
use
of
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they’re
claiming
we
are
but
the
fact
here
is
that
the
claims
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
claims
simply
do
not
extend
that
far
and
furthermore
the
government
doesn’t
really
want
to
win
on
the
ground
but
the
claims
go
too
far
what
they
want
is
a
rule
that
exclude
all
this
programs
and
we’ve
any
trouble
about
these
claims.
claims
could
easily
be
drawn.
they
would
put
it
beyond
the
doubt
of
even
17th
century’s
advances
that
these
claims
didn’t
extend
to
anything
except
the
use
of
this
method
in
the
machine.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it’s
process
in
the
machine
process.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
there
isn’t
any
definition
beyond
the
word.
it’s
--
but
it
is
you
could
say
it’s
a
new
use
about.
it’s
a
process
for
a
new
use
of
an
old
machine
possibly
although
i
really
think
that
this
point
is
developed
both
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
others
that
when
a
thing
like
this
is
used
in
a
computer,
you
so
change
the
function
of
the
computer
that
really
become
a
new
machine.
but
i
would
say
that
this
is
process
because
it
achieves
by
a
result,
a
useful
result
by
a
series
of
machine
steps
that
had
not
there
before
have
been
achieved
in
this
manner.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
am
not
sure
of
that
and
i
think
you
could
because
the
machine,
you
change
the
circuit
–
you
change
the
circuitry
in
the
sense
temporarily.
of
course,
if
you
had
a
problem
why
had
circuit
did
this?
i
think
you
could
get
a
patent
on.
and
in
fact,
the
patent
has
been
issued
on
by
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
you
need
to
process
patent
because
the
very
--
the
very
purpose
of
programs
and
the
utility
programs
sends
the
inventiveness
in
programs
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
makes
possible
to
use
a
machine
without
changing
the
circuitry.
you
can
change
the
machine
without
changing
the
circuitry
by
changing
the
way
it
functions
it
performs.
and
the
point
is
when
you
have
a
method,
a
process
that
does
that.
it
seems
to
me
to
fall
squarely
within
the
definitions
as
a
process
that
they’ve
been
laid
down
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
section
101
simply
speaks,
uses
the
word
“process”
without
trying
to
define
it
but
there
is
a
definition
and
i
think
in
100
which
says
that
tries
to
give
a
little
content.
but
the
--
i
think
this
might
be
inappropriate
place
for
me
to
say
something
about
the
piano
roll
analogy
which
was
brought
into
the
argument
a
little
while
ago
because
i
think
the
--
precisely
on
this
point
that
the
piano
roll
analogy
breaks
down
the
--
when
the
program
does
make
a
difference
in
a
technological
functioning
of
the
machine.
it
rearranges
the
way
the
signals
operate,
the
way
the
circuits
operate,
so
that
there
is
a
difference
of
that
kind
and
now
that
the
piano
roll
produces
a
different
song
but
that’s
the
only
difference
between
one
piano
roll
or
another,
and
the
real,
of
course
that
kind
of
value
is
not
protected
by
the
patent
law,
it’s
necessary
value.
so
that
the
--
i
think
the
piano
roll
is
more
comparable
to
the
numbers
of
data
that’s
fed
into
a
computer
because
the
piano
roll
doesn’t
actually
change
the
function
of
what
to
play
the
piano
does
produces
a
different
tune
which
is
not
subject
to
patent
--
protection
at
all.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
at
this
point
because
i
think
there’s
a
confusion
that’s
involved
that
this
patent
claims
do
not
attempt
to
claim
the
mathematics
as
such.
anybody
who
wants
to
practice
this
method
of
mathematics
but
not
the
method
because
the
method
is
series
of
machines
steps
but
anyone
who
wants
to
use
the
mathematics
to
convert
numbers
by
pen
or
pencil
or
by
some
other
kind
of
a
machine
calculating
machine
or
a
machine
that
isn’t
an
electrical
data
processing
machine
can
do
so
without
infringing
these
claims.
the
claims
don’t
cover
that.
all
these
claims
cover
is
this
specific
series
of
steps
carried
on
within
an
electrical
data
processing
machine.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
we
think
it
did
say
so,
if
may
it
please.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
that
is
--
mr.
justice
white,
the
respondents
here
had
consistently
taken
the
position
and
patent
over
all
the
way
through
that
that’s
what
claim
13
meant.
and
in
the
patent
office
they
offered
and
tried
to
amend
claim
13
to
put
in
the
words
“electrical
signals”
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
and
patent
office
examiner
wouldn’t
allow
them
to
do
it
because
as
far
as
i
understand
what
he
said,
he
said
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference.
you
see,
the
real
point
in
this
case
is
the
point
that
i
think
that
was
made
this
morning
and
its
point
that
has
no
sanction
as
submitted
decision,
it’s
the
notion.
but
you
can’t
get
a
patent
here
on
these
machine
steps
because
the
machine
by
mechanical
means
is
doing
something
that
the
human
mind
could
also
do
by
using
the
same
mathematics.
that’s
what
the
argument
comes
to
and
i
submit
there’s
no
justification
for
it
and
it’s
really
inconsistent
with
the
whole
150
years
of
development
under
patent
laws
because
the
essence
of
most
inventions
is
substituting
--
or
many
inventions
is
substituting
mechanical
effort
for
human
effort.
of
course,
a
mental
by
mental
process
you
can
do
this
conversion.
what
the
respondents
here
have
done
is
to
invent
a
--
device
a
method
we
are
doing
it
in
a
machine
which
enhances
the
operations.
the
machine
and
enables
the
machine
to
do
something
more
efficiently
than
what
could
be
done
simply
by
other
methods.
now,
to
speak
of
this
to
merely
because
the
conversion
has
certain
representational
value
represents
symbols
that
means
something
for
a
given
conventional
value
in
a
man’s
mind
does
not
seem
to
be
suggested
if
there’s
anything,
any
reason
why
it
can’t
be
patented.
after
all,
communication
depends
upon
the
same
kind
of
convention
and
when
you
talk
over
the
telephone
and
communication
is
sensible
only
because
the
words
“by
convention”
have
certain
meanings
to
the
person
who
listens
to
you
and
that’s
true
in
this
case
as
to
the
number.
they
are
assigned
conventionally
to
certain
symbolic
significance.
but
that
doesn’t
--
it
seem
to
me
have
anything
to
do
with
the
question
whether
the
machine
method
for
making
these
computation
is
patentable.
it
isn’t
a
mental
process.
the
claims
don’t
cover
the
mathematics
as
such
they
don’t
monopolize
the
mathematics,
it
simply
claim
on
a
machine
method.
now,
the
argument
i
think
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
patent
a
principal
or
a
long
nature
simply
misconceives
the
origins
and
the
nature
of
that
rule
because
when
you
read
the
cases,
and
it’s
an
old
rule
you
see
that
those
cases
really
stand
for
this.
there
are
cases
that
hold
in
the
first
place
a
man
cannot
get
a
patent
on
a
principal
in
the
general
and
the
abstract
and
simply
he
must
make
a
specific
application
of
principle
to
the
useful
art
and
furthermore,
he
cannot
get
a
patent
on
some
application
that
he
hasn’t
invented.
now,
i
submit
that
these
claims
here
satisfy
both
tests.
the
respondents
discovered
this
mathematical
relationship
what
is
more
important
to
determine
that
would
be
useful
in
device
and
machine
method
and
the
only
thing
that
they
are
claiming
is
a
particular
machine
method
that
they
invented.
they
are
not
claiming
the
principle
except
that
it
is
applied
by
these
steps
and
machine
so
they
do
not
run
or
follow
of
either
aspect
of
the
rule
against
patenting
a
general
principle.
there
is
a
--
i
submit
a
kind
of
strained
and
artificial
quality
about
all
these
arguments
that
are
made
against
patent
ability
of
these
claims.
they
used
the
conventional
terms
to
patent
law
and
the
conventional
concepts
but
when
you
look
at
the
argument
say
do
not
those
applications
don’t
simply
don’t
apply
take
the
reliance
upon
the
telephone
cases.
now,
there’s
one
thing
that
is
perfectly
clear
about
the
telephone
case
is
that
that
case
did
not
hold
that
a
method
patent
had
to
be
confined
to
use
on
a
particular
kind
of
apparatus.
what
that
case
held
was
that
if
you
had
a
solid
method
claim
--
method
claim
it
extended
to
the
use
of
the
method
on
any
apparatus.
that
was
used
to
practice
the
claim
and
in
fact
in
that
case,
the
court
upheld
that
claim
and
held
that
it
was
infringed
by
the
use
of
an
apparatus
of
practice
to
method
although
it
was
an
apparatus
that
mr.
bell
had
not
described
in
this
patent
as
far
as
you
can
tell
from
the
record
and
never
even
dreamed
of.
the
limitations
that
petitioners
says
must
be
put
on
a
method
claim
of
this
kind
are
simply
not
required
by
the
cases
and
indeed
in
certain
respects
their
argument
is
puzzled
because
in
their
brief
at
least
they
seem
to
be
more
cautious
in
oral
argument.
they
suggested
it
may
be
this
patent
would
be
all
right
if
it
had
been
confined
to
use
in
a
pbx.
that
is
really
strange
suggestion
because
the
subject
matter
is
the
same
whether
it’s
use
in
pbx
or
whether
it’s
use
in
all
computers.
it’s
no
more
or
no
less
than
mathematical
axiom
or
a
principle
in
the
one
case
than
it
is
on
the
other.
the
point
is
that
this
is
useful
in
all
digital
computers
and
was
properly
claimed
in
those
terms
not
to
claimed
in
any
terms
of
any
other
machine
would
claim
in
terms
of
electrical
data
processing
machine.
now,
all
of
these
arguments
really
seem
to
me
to
be
as
i
say
i
think
they
are
restrained
arguments
because
they
are
directed
to
an
end.
they
are
examples
though
realizing
trying
to
do
the
work
of
analysis
what
the
petitioner
wants
and
what
the
amici
wants
who
were
supporting
him
is
a
broad
rule
of
law
that
will
exclude
from
the
patent
act
and
the
protection
of
patent
act
all
computer
processes
and
program.
and
indeed,
they
presented
that
case
in
those
terms
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
suppose
that’s
why
the
case
is
here
because
this
court
will
ordinarily
not
take
cases
on
a
certiorari
simply
or
normal
run
affairs
simply
to
look
at
the
circumstances
affecting
a
particular
patent.
and
i
--
therefore
i
think
i
am
obliged
to
say
something
about
the
policy
arguments
if
they
advance
to
support
this
broad
result.
now,
the
first
thing
i
am
going
to
say
and
i’m
just
i
am
going
to
pass
over
it
because
we’ve
developed
it
in
our
brief.
we
think,
it’s
inconsistent
with
the
both
the
(inaudible)
patent
law,
letter
of
the
patent
law,
and
150
years
of
decision
to
exclude
the
whole
field
of
technology
in
this
way
because
the
patent
law
has
constantly
been
interpreted
and
applied
as
extending
the
new
field
of
technology
as
they
come
along
if
the
inventions
meet
the
standard
of
the
act.
beyond
that,
i
submit
that
these
reasons,
these
policy
reasons
which
they
advanced
with
a
broad
rule
of
law
that
they
while
will
not
withstand
examination
what
they’re
viewed
in
relation
to
the
patent
act
itself.
the
petitioner
or
the
petitioner
patent
says
it
will
burdensome
and
inconvenient
if
he
has
to
search
classify
and
examine
the
patents
in
this
field
and
i
submit
that
it’s
hardly
a
good
reason
for
a
denying
patentability
to
a
whole
area
of
patents.
of
course,
it
will
involve
some
additional
work
any
new
technology
does.
but
the
standards
of
patent
act
should
not
be
bent
or
departed
from
for
that
reason
and
using
for
difficulties
in
any
even
or
exaggerated
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
our
brief.
but
that
brings
me
to
the
other
saying
that
i
find
myself
obliged
to
say
something
about
which
is
the
economic
reality
that
underlies
this
contest
over
whether
these
process
should
be
patentable.
we
examined
the
briefs
in
this
case.
the
brief
amici,
you
will
see
that
the
patentability
of
this
program
is
opposed
by
the
group
of
hardware
manufacturers.
they
are
large
companies
whose
business
is
primarily
the
manufacturer
of
the
computers
although
they
also
manufacture
programs
called
software.
the
patentability
of
the
program
is
supported
by
the
companies
which
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
software
or
making
device
and
getting
computer
programs
and
process.
these
companies
are
for
the
most
as
compared
to
the
hardware
industry
is
a
concentrated
industry.
there
are
three
or
four
companies
in
it
and
one
of
them
ibm
has
by
far
the
largest
share
of
the
market.
the
software
industry
on
the
other
hand
is
a
divert
--
is
a
defused
and
diversified
industry
with
a
lot
of
companies
in
it
most
of
them
are
small.
they
are
precisely
the
kind
of
enterprises
that
need
the
protection
of
patents
in
order
to
stimulate
research,
invention,
to
raise
capital
and
protect
those
time
they
spent
on
developing
these
things
of
which.
and
they
are
the
source
from
which
you
might
reasonably
expect
invention
would
come
because
the
hardware
manufacturers
are
far
more
interested
in
their
machinery
and
sometimes
these
programs
cut
down
the
use
of
the
machinery
and
they
make
simpler
machine
revisable.
they
are
far
more
interested
in
their
machineries
than
they
are
in
the
program.
so
the
patentability
of
these
computer
possessors
and
programs,
i
submit,
will
be
consistent
with
the
policy
of
that
law
because
it
will
provide
protection
and
stimulation
for
invention
from
the
various
sources
which
needs
the
protection
and
from
which
invention
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
come.
so,
i
submit
in
conclusion
that
whether
you
look
at
this
case
in
terms
of
the
conventional
standards
of
the
patent
act
as
they’ve
been
developed
in
150
years
of
decision
or
whether
you
go
beyond
that
and
look
at
the
terms
of
the
policy
argument
that
have
been
presented
here,
either
view
of
the
matter
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
question
is
added
here
is
whether
a
method
for
converting
electrical
signals
in
an
electrical
data
processing
machine
that
signals
that
represent
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
into
pure
binary
numbers
is
a
patentable
invention
under
section
101
of
the
statute.
the
only
issue
seems
to
be
an
issue
of
subject
matter.
the
claims
were
not
rejected
in
the
patent
office
on
any
grounds
of
utility,
novelty
or
business.
those
points
weren’t
raised
or
decided
in
the
court
below
as
i
understood
in
argument
for
counsel
for
the
commissioner
this
morning,
he
is
not
raising
in
those
points
in
this
court.
so
that
i
submit
the
question
of
subject
matter
has
to
be
considered
on
the
assumption
that
these
claims
are
useful,
noble,
and
non-obvious.
and
i
should
like
to
begin
by
saying
a
word
about
the
background
with
the
nature
of
this
invention.
the
respondents
here
have
made
the
invention
because
they
were
working
on
what
was
essentially
a
machine
problem
and
they
saw
the
problem
by
inventing
a
machine
method.
they
were
working
on
a
pbx
and
i
think
the
pbx
as
i
assume
all,
everyone
knows
is
a
switching
device
that
connects
a
group
of
telephones
one
to
the
other
and
also
connects
those
telephones
with
outside
telephones.
it’s
used
in
a
hotel
for
example,
connect
all
phones
in
the
hotel
in
all
zones
and
outside
phones
to
use
the
same
way
in
an
office.
now,
one
of
the
elements
of
this
switching
device
was
a
control
unit
which
was
a
kind
of
digital
computer.
it
received
electrical
impulses
around
the
telephone
making
the
call
by
electrical
impulses
that
identified
the
telephone
that
was
being
called
and
then
it
connected
the
two
telephones.
now,
to
carry
out
to
this
function
it
was
necessary
in
that
control
unit
to
convert
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
(bcd)
numbers
into
pure
binary
numbers.
what
the
respondents
are
working
on
this
problem
there
were
numbers
of
quite
a
number
of
known
ways
of
converting
bcd
numbers
into
binary
numbers.
but
all
of
these
ways
were
unsatisfactory
simply
because
of
the
physical
limitations
of
the
computer
was
which
the
respondents
were
working.
some
of
the
message
required
storage
over
in
that
computer
of
elaborate
cables
of
conversion
of
values
and
then
circuits
to
do
what
is
called
multi-digit
adding.
some
of
them
required
others
special
circuits
to
perform
special
functions.
now
the
computer
at
least
that
the
respondents
are
working
with
didn’t
have
storage
capacity.
it
didn’t
have
multi-digit
adding
circuits.
it
didn’t
have
these
others
special
circuits.
so
their
problem
was
to
find
a
method
of
converting
bcd
numbers
into
binary
numbers
that
was
to
be
consistent
and
feasible
and
efficient
within
the
terms
of
the
physical
limitations
of
this
computer
that
they’re
working
with.
and
they
discovered
such
a
method.
now,
we’ve
described
the
method
in
our
brief
and
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
briefly
simply
will
say
this
it
consists
of
processing
a
bcd
number
in
a
series
of
repetitive
cycles
and
do
this
to
the
electrical
impulses
in
the
machine
and
each
cycle
and
electrical
impulse
is
detected,
discovered
by
another
electrical
impulse,
its
canceled
and
then
two
electrical
impulses
are
inserted
in
pre-designated
places
in
the
original
sequence
of
impulses
that
you
are
converting.
and
when
you
have
done
that
for
each
signal
in
the
bcd,
series
of
signals
under
this
process,
you
then
obtain
a
series
of
signals
which
have
a
representational
value
that
is
equivalent
in
binary
to
the
representational
value
in
bcd
with
which
you
stock.
now,
in
discovering
and
inventing
this
method
the
respondents
detected
that
there
was
a
mathematical
relationship
that
would
be
useful
and
i
am
emphasize
that
because
the
important
thing
here
is
the
recognition
that
this
relationship,
this
mathematical
relationship
could
be
useful
in
devising
a
machine
method
that
would
solve
their
problem
and
by
the
result
of
that
recognition
may
devised
this
simple
method
of
carrying
out
this
operation
and
it
had
great
advantages
of
course
for
them
that
made
it
possible
for
this
computer
they
were
working
with
to
do
something
that
it
couldn’t
do
before.
and
it
has
advantages
for
any
digital
computer,
even
though
it
has
more
elaborate
equipment
in
the
equipment
in
that
computer
with
which
they
were
working,
it
reduces
a
number
of
signals
in
the
amount
of
circuitry
you
have
to
use
and
that
reduces
a
possibility
of
errors
through
circuit
malfunction
which
sometimes
happens.
it
means
that
you
don’t
have
to
use
a
lot
of
storage
space
in
the
computer
even
if
you
have
which
is
often
a
convenience
if
necessary.
now,
as
i’ve
said
and
it
sorted,
it
has
advantages,
substantial,
synergistic
advantages
in
any
kind
of
a
digital
computer.
now,
as
i
have
said,
they
were
able
to
do
to
make
devised
this
method
because
they
recognized
that
this
mathematical
relationship
could
be
used
to
advantage
in
a
machine
in
converting
this
bcd
rapper
signals
its
impulses
and
the
impulses
representing
pure
binary
numbers.
but
the
fact
in
claim
is
on
the
machine
method
and
not
on
the
mathematics.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
point
because
it’s
a
confusion
that
seems
to
me
to
run
through
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
here.
there
are
two
claims
in
this
case.
they
were
both
rejected
by
the
patent
office
on
the
ground
and
the
sole
ground
that
they
represented
mental
or
they
we
don’t
have
to
claim
mental
processors
and
mathematical
steps.
the
court
below
have
reversed
holding
that
they
were
claims
on
the
machine
--
on
the
machine
method
that
we
submit
to
the
court
below
was
right.
we’ve
discussed
the
language
of
those
can’t
--
claims
of
great
lengths
in
our
brief.
i
don’t
propose
that
we
tread
that
discussion
here,
i
will
simply
say
this.
but
i
think
they’re
really
isn’t
any
room
for
argument
about
claim
8.
it’s
stated
in
terms
of
a
machine
method
no
one
would
describe
anything
else
in
the
terms
of
used
in
that
claim
and
the
government,
the
petitioner
doesn’t
really
argue
that
there’s
any
doubt
that
that
claim
is
confined
to
a
method
to
be
practice
on
an
electrical
data
processing
machine
computer.
they
make
some
arguments
about
claim
13,
we
think
those
arguments
are
wrong.
we
think
when
the
claim
is
read
as
a
whole
and
in
the
context
it
too
like
claim
8,
simply
claims
a
method
that
is
to
be
practice
on
an
electrical
data
processing
machine.
but
whether
there
is
merit
in
those
arguments
are
not
they
can’t
--
they
don’t
apply
to
claim
8
because
they
depend
upon
the
language
of
claim
13,
claim
8
stands
on
an
independent
basis.
now,
i
should
like
now
to
examine
the
reasons
of
the
petitioner
here
argues
the
same
that
this
machine
method
is
not
covering,
not
patentable
subject
matter
under
section
101
of
the
statute.
i
don’t
really
think
that
petitioner
is
relying
in
any
of
degree
on
the
conventional
patent
law
doctrine
about
mental
steps.
he
said
this
morning
that
the
computer
doesn’t
think
and
i
supposed
there’s
no
about
that
when
this
method
is
practiced,
it
is
a
practice
for
manipulating
electrical
signals
and
when
the
steps
describe
in
the
claims
are
taken
signals
are
detected,
blanked
out,
transferred,
inserted
in
other
places.
it
is
a
mechanical
operation.
the
rule
against
patenting
mental
steps
is
simply
a
rule
that
you
can’t
patent
something,
that
goes
on
the
line
and
the
respondents
here
are
not
attempted
to
do
that.
these
claims
are
confined
of
the
steps
that
take
place
in
a
machine.
i
think
what
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
they
might
ask.
i
think
they
will
be
in
trouble.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
they
--
i
say
--
i
have
taken
your
word
in
troubles
because
i
think
that
you
would
raised
in
a
serious
questions.
i
think
there
is
a
rule
and
probably
a
sensible
rule
that
you
cannot
get
a
patent
on
something
that
goes
on
simply
in
the
mind.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
there
would
be
a
serious
question
there
because
i
would
doubt
whether
they
have
would
have
made
the
specific
application
over
other
than
a
useful
arts.
see
there’s
a
very
old
doctrine
that
i
am
going
to
say
something
about
that
moment
about
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
would.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
but
the
trouble
with
it
mr.
justice
white
i
think
would
be
in
position
rather
of
arguing
on
the
other
side
of
this
but
the
trouble
would
be
that
make
specific
application
of
the
--
of
the
thing
of
useful
arts
of
claim
may
be
so
broad
as
to
preclude
any
use
of
the
formula
told
by
even
for
purposes
of
a
speculation
or
thought
or
something
of
that
kind
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
basis
use
the
old
rule
that
you
can’t
--
you
can’t
patent
a
natural
law
as
such
or
a
principle
as
such
question.
respondents
here
haven’t
tried
to
do
that.
but
i
think
there
would
be
if
they
had
--
if
this
patent
claims
simply
read,
“we
patent
this
method
of
converting
numbers,”
i
think
that
it
would
be
an
arguable
question
whether
they
will
be
patentable.
but
it
isn’t
here
that
question
isn’t
here.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
wouldn’t
have
any
case
at
all
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
question
isn’t
here
because
respondents
here
haven’t
made
that
kind
of
a
claim,
mr.
justice
white.
they
have
only
claimed
the
use
of
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they’re
claiming
we
are
but
the
fact
here
is
that
the
claims
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
claims
simply
do
not
extend
that
far
and
furthermore
the
government
doesn’t
really
want
to
win
on
the
ground
but
the
claims
go
too
far
what
they
want
is
a
rule
that
exclude
all
this
programs
and
we’ve
any
trouble
about
these
claims.
claims
could
easily
be
drawn.
they
would
put
it
beyond
the
doubt
of
even
17th
century’s
advances
that
these
claims
didn’t
extend
to
anything
except
the
use
of
this
method
in
the
machine.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it’s
process
in
the
machine
process.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
there
isn’t
any
definition
beyond
the
word.
it’s
--
but
it
is
you
could
say
it’s
a
new
use
about.
it’s
a
process
for
a
new
use
of
an
old
machine
possibly
although
i
really
think
that
this
point
is
developed
both
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
others
that
when
a
thing
like
this
is
used
in
a
computer,
you
so
change
the
function
of
the
computer
that
really
become
a
new
machine.
but
i
would
say
that
this
is
process
because
it
achieves
by
a
result,
a
useful
result
by
a
series
of
machine
steps
that
had
not
there
before
have
been
achieved
in
this
manner.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
am
not
sure
of
that
and
i
think
you
could
because
the
machine,
you
change
the
circuit
–
you
change
the
circuitry
in
the
sense
temporarily.
of
course,
if
you
had
a
problem
why
had
circuit
did
this?
i
think
you
could
get
a
patent
on.
and
in
fact,
the
patent
has
been
issued
on
by
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
you
need
to
process
patent
because
the
very
--
the
very
purpose
of
programs
and
the
utility
programs
sends
the
inventiveness
in
programs
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
makes
possible
to
use
a
machine
without
changing
the
circuitry.
you
can
change
the
machine
without
changing
the
circuitry
by
changing
the
way
it
functions
it
performs.
and
the
point
is
when
you
have
a
method,
a
process
that
does
that.
it
seems
to
me
to
fall
squarely
within
the
definitions
as
a
process
that
they’ve
been
laid
down
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
section
101
simply
speaks,
uses
the
word
“process”
without
trying
to
define
it
but
there
is
a
definition
and
i
think
in
100
which
says
that
tries
to
give
a
little
content.
but
the
--
i
think
this
might
be
inappropriate
place
for
me
to
say
something
about
the
piano
roll
analogy
which
was
brought
into
the
argument
a
little
while
ago
because
i
think
the
--
precisely
on
this
point
that
the
piano
roll
analogy
breaks
down
the
--
when
the
program
does
make
a
difference
in
a
technological
functioning
of
the
machine.
it
rearranges
the
way
the
signals
operate,
the
way
the
circuits
operate,
so
that
there
is
a
difference
of
that
kind
and
now
that
the
piano
roll
produces
a
different
song
but
that’s
the
only
difference
between
one
piano
roll
or
another,
and
the
real,
of
course
that
kind
of
value
is
not
protected
by
the
patent
law,
it’s
necessary
value.
so
that
the
--
i
think
the
piano
roll
is
more
comparable
to
the
numbers
of
data
that’s
fed
into
a
computer
because
the
piano
roll
doesn’t
actually
change
the
function
of
what
to
play
the
piano
does
produces
a
different
tune
which
is
not
subject
to
patent
--
protection
at
all.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
at
this
point
because
i
think
there’s
a
confusion
that’s
involved
that
this
patent
claims
do
not
attempt
to
claim
the
mathematics
as
such.
anybody
who
wants
to
practice
this
method
of
mathematics
but
not
the
method
because
the
method
is
series
of
machines
steps
but
anyone
who
wants
to
use
the
mathematics
to
convert
numbers
by
pen
or
pencil
or
by
some
other
kind
of
a
machine
calculating
machine
or
a
machine
that
isn’t
an
electrical
data
processing
machine
can
do
so
without
infringing
these
claims.
the
claims
don’t
cover
that.
all
these
claims
cover
is
this
specific
series
of
steps
carried
on
within
an
electrical
data
processing
machine.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
we
think
it
did
say
so,
if
may
it
please.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
that
is
--
mr.
justice
white,
the
respondents
here
had
consistently
taken
the
position
and
patent
over
all
the
way
through
that
that’s
what
claim
13
meant.
and
in
the
patent
office
they
offered
and
tried
to
amend
claim
13
to
put
in
the
words
“electrical
signals”
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
and
patent
office
examiner
wouldn’t
allow
them
to
do
it
because
as
far
as
i
understand
what
he
said,
he
said
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference.
you
see,
the
real
point
in
this
case
is
the
point
that
i
think
that
was
made
this
morning
and
its
point
that
has
no
sanction
as
submitted
decision,
it’s
the
notion.
but
you
can’t
get
a
patent
here
on
these
machine
steps
because
the
machine
by
mechanical
means
is
doing
something
that
the
human
mind
could
also
do
by
using
the
same
mathematics.
that’s
what
the
argument
comes
to
and
i
submit
there’s
no
justification
for
it
and
it’s
really
inconsistent
with
the
whole
150
years
of
development
under
patent
laws
because
the
essence
of
most
inventions
is
substituting
--
or
many
inventions
is
substituting
mechanical
effort
for
human
effort.
of
course,
a
mental
by
mental
process
you
can
do
this
conversion.
what
the
respondents
here
have
done
is
to
invent
a
--
device
a
method
we
are
doing
it
in
a
machine
which
enhances
the
operations.
the
machine
and
enables
the
machine
to
do
something
more
efficiently
than
what
could
be
done
simply
by
other
methods.
now,
to
speak
of
this
to
merely
because
the
conversion
has
certain
representational
value
represents
symbols
that
means
something
for
a
given
conventional
value
in
a
man’s
mind
does
not
seem
to
be
suggested
if
there’s
anything,
any
reason
why
it
can’t
be
patented.
after
all,
communication
depends
upon
the
same
kind
of
convention
and
when
you
talk
over
the
telephone
and
communication
is
sensible
only
because
the
words
“by
convention”
have
certain
meanings
to
the
person
who
listens
to
you
and
that’s
true
in
this
case
as
to
the
number.
they
are
assigned
conventionally
to
certain
symbolic
significance.
but
that
doesn’t
--
it
seem
to
me
have
anything
to
do
with
the
question
whether
the
machine
method
for
making
these
computation
is
patentable.
it
isn’t
a
mental
process.
the
claims
don’t
cover
the
mathematics
as
such
they
don’t
monopolize
the
mathematics,
it
simply
claim
on
a
machine
method.
now,
the
argument
i
think
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
patent
a
principal
or
a
long
nature
simply
misconceives
the
origins
and
the
nature
of
that
rule
because
when
you
read
the
cases,
and
it’s
an
old
rule
you
see
that
those
cases
really
stand
for
this.
there
are
cases
that
hold
in
the
first
place
a
man
cannot
get
a
patent
on
a
principal
in
the
general
and
the
abstract
and
simply
he
must
make
a
specific
application
of
principle
to
the
useful
art
and
furthermore,
he
cannot
get
a
patent
on
some
application
that
he
hasn’t
invented.
now,
i
submit
that
these
claims
here
satisfy
both
tests.
the
respondents
discovered
this
mathematical
relationship
what
is
more
important
to
determine
that
would
be
useful
in
device
and
machine
method
and
the
only
thing
that
they
are
claiming
is
a
particular
machine
method
that
they
invented.
they
are
not
claiming
the
principle
except
that
it
is
applied
by
these
steps
and
machine
so
they
do
not
run
or
follow
of
either
aspect
of
the
rule
against
patenting
a
general
principle.
there
is
a
--
i
submit
a
kind
of
strained
and
artificial
quality
about
all
these
arguments
that
are
made
against
patent
ability
of
these
claims.
they
used
the
conventional
terms
to
patent
law
and
the
conventional
concepts
but
when
you
look
at
the
argument
say
do
not
those
applications
don’t
simply
don’t
apply
take
the
reliance
upon
the
telephone
cases.
now,
there’s
one
thing
that
is
perfectly
clear
about
the
telephone
case
is
that
that
case
did
not
hold
that
a
method
patent
had
to
be
confined
to
use
on
a
particular
kind
of
apparatus.
what
that
case
held
was
that
if
you
had
a
solid
method
claim
--
method
claim
it
extended
to
the
use
of
the
method
on
any
apparatus.
that
was
used
to
practice
the
claim
and
in
fact
in
that
case,
the
court
upheld
that
claim
and
held
that
it
was
infringed
by
the
use
of
an
apparatus
of
practice
to
method
although
it
was
an
apparatus
that
mr.
bell
had
not
described
in
this
patent
as
far
as
you
can
tell
from
the
record
and
never
even
dreamed
of.
the
limitations
that
petitioners
says
must
be
put
on
a
method
claim
of
this
kind
are
simply
not
required
by
the
cases
and
indeed
in
certain
respects
their
argument
is
puzzled
because
in
their
brief
at
least
they
seem
to
be
more
cautious
in
oral
argument.
they
suggested
it
may
be
this
patent
would
be
all
right
if
it
had
been
confined
to
use
in
a
pbx.
that
is
really
strange
suggestion
because
the
subject
matter
is
the
same
whether
it’s
use
in
pbx
or
whether
it’s
use
in
all
computers.
it’s
no
more
or
no
less
than
mathematical
axiom
or
a
principle
in
the
one
case
than
it
is
on
the
other.
the
point
is
that
this
is
useful
in
all
digital
computers
and
was
properly
claimed
in
those
terms
not
to
claimed
in
any
terms
of
any
other
machine
would
claim
in
terms
of
electrical
data
processing
machine.
now,
all
of
these
arguments
really
seem
to
me
to
be
as
i
say
i
think
they
are
restrained
arguments
because
they
are
directed
to
an
end.
they
are
examples
though
realizing
trying
to
do
the
work
of
analysis
what
the
petitioner
wants
and
what
the
amici
wants
who
were
supporting
him
is
a
broad
rule
of
law
that
will
exclude
from
the
patent
act
and
the
protection
of
patent
act
all
computer
processes
and
program.
and
indeed,
they
presented
that
case
in
those
terms
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
suppose
that’s
why
the
case
is
here
because
this
court
will
ordinarily
not
take
cases
on
a
certiorari
simply
or
normal
run
affairs
simply
to
look
at
the
circumstances
affecting
a
particular
patent.
and
i
--
therefore
i
think
i
am
obliged
to
say
something
about
the
policy
arguments
if
they
advance
to
support
this
broad
result.
now,
the
first
thing
i
am
going
to
say
and
i’m
just
i
am
going
to
pass
over
it
because
we’ve
developed
it
in
our
brief.
we
think,
it’s
inconsistent
with
the
both
the
(inaudible)
patent
law,
letter
of
the
patent
law,
and
150
years
of
decision
to
exclude
the
whole
field
of
technology
in
this
way
because
the
patent
law
has
constantly
been
interpreted
and
applied
as
extending
the
new
field
of
technology
as
they
come
along
if
the
inventions
meet
the
standard
of
the
act.
beyond
that,
i
submit
that
these
reasons,
these
policy
reasons
which
they
advanced
with
a
broad
rule
of
law
that
they
while
will
not
withstand
examination
what
they’re
viewed
in
relation
to
the
patent
act
itself.
the
petitioner
or
the
petitioner
patent
says
it
will
burdensome
and
inconvenient
if
he
has
to
search
classify
and
examine
the
patents
in
this
field
and
i
submit
that
it’s
hardly
a
good
reason
for
a
denying
patentability
to
a
whole
area
of
patents.
of
course,
it
will
involve
some
additional
work
any
new
technology
does.
but
the
standards
of
patent
act
should
not
be
bent
or
departed
from
for
that
reason
and
using
for
difficulties
in
any
even
or
exaggerated
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
our
brief.
but
that
brings
me
to
the
other
saying
that
i
find
myself
obliged
to
say
something
about
which
is
the
economic
reality
that
underlies
this
contest
over
whether
these
process
should
be
patentable.
we
examined
the
briefs
in
this
case.
the
brief
amici,
you
will
see
that
the
patentability
of
this
program
is
opposed
by
the
group
of
hardware
manufacturers.
they
are
large
companies
whose
business
is
primarily
the
manufacturer
of
the
computers
although
they
also
manufacture
programs
called
software.
the
patentability
of
the
program
is
supported
by
the
companies
which
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
software
or
making
device
and
getting
computer
programs
and
process.
these
companies
are
for
the
most
as
compared
to
the
hardware
industry
is
a
concentrated
industry.
there
are
three
or
four
companies
in
it
and
one
of
them
ibm
has
by
far
the
largest
share
of
the
market.
the
software
industry
on
the
other
hand
is
a
divert
--
is
a
defused
and
diversified
industry
with
a
lot
of
companies
in
it
most
of
them
are
small.
they
are
precisely
the
kind
of
enterprises
that
need
the
protection
of
patents
in
order
to
stimulate
research,
invention,
to
raise
capital
and
protect
those
time
they
spent
on
developing
these
things
of
which.
and
they
are
the
source
from
which
you
might
reasonably
expect
invention
would
come
because
the
hardware
manufacturers
are
far
more
interested
in
their
machinery
and
sometimes
these
programs
cut
down
the
use
of
the
machinery
and
they
make
simpler
machine
revisable.
they
are
far
more
interested
in
their
machineries
than
they
are
in
the
program.
so
the
patentability
of
these
computer
possessors
and
programs,
i
submit,
will
be
consistent
with
the
policy
of
that
law
because
it
will
provide
protection
and
stimulation
for
invention
from
the
various
sources
which
needs
the
protection
and
from
which
invention
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
come.
so,
i
submit
in
conclusion
that
whether
you
look
at
this
case
in
terms
of
the
conventional
standards
of
the
patent
act
as
they’ve
been
developed
in
150
years
of
decision
or
whether
you
go
beyond
that
and
look
at
the
terms
of
the
policy
argument
that
have
been
presented
here,
either
view
of
the
matter
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
