is
the
computer
itself
patentable?
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
they’re
having
done
any
computers
until
they
invented
one
to
make
this
conversion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
just
think
they
haven’t
claim
the
computer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
--
assume
if
--
if
there
haven’t
been
any
computers
and
they
invented
the
computer
to
carry
out
this
process
and
that
was
patentable,
why
is
that
--
why
isn’t
this
against
the
background
of
the
existing
computers,
why
is
this
a
new
piece
of
an
old
machine?
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
something
it
never
did
before
although
to
put
it
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
well,
until
this
process
was
discovered,
computers
have
never
done
this
particular
operation
had
it?
until
this
came
along,
the
computers
never
done
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
a
computer
is
programmed
to
give
this
answer
it
isn’t
the
same
machine
as
it
is
when
it
isn’t
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
put
in
--
why
put
in
the
instructions
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
do
reduce
the
programs
doing
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don’t
add
a
thing
to
a
computer.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cox,
if
the
claims
work
or
do
machine,
would
these
claims
be
in
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
these
applicants
had
simply
stated
in
their
claims
this
method,
this
relationship,
this
way
of
converting,
you
would
agree
it
would
not
be
patentable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
still
be
very
useful.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
if
the
man
could
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the,
i
would
suppose
it
is
--
if
there
weren’t
such
a
principle,
the
government
wouldn’t
have
any
case
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
question
is
here
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
government
is
claiming
you
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
this
case
is
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
what
--
do
you
claim
this
is
a
process,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
part
of
the
definition
of
process
in
the
statute
do
you
think
is
called?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
couldn’t
you
get
a
--
then
as
you
--
as
you
put
it
you
could
get
a
patent
on
the
machine
once
you
put
the
program
in
there
and
you
get
a
patent
on
that
machine
when
it’s
set
up
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
its
instantly,
if
the
machine
hasn’t
been
change
then
argue
your
dealing
is
using
the
machine
to
carry
out
a
mental
process,
if
it
is
in
the
machine,
why
would
you
need
to
process
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn’t
any
claim
13
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn’t
use
those
words.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
have
been
aptly
easy
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
computer
itself
patentable?
justice

assuming
