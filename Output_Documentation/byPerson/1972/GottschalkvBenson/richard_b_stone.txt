mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
in
a
somewhat
unusual
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
raises
the
question
whether
respondents
are
in
entitled
to
a
patent
on
a
method
which
they
have
devised
for
converting
numerical
information
expressed
in
one
form
of
mathematical
language
into
another
mathematical
language.
both
of
which
languages
are
used
extensively
in
general
purpose
digital
computers.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
our
bet
is
precisely
--
our
contention
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
what
respondents
have
claimed
here
is
simply
a
set
of
steps
to
be
carried
out
in
a
machine.
they
have
tried
to
link
the
claim
that
they
have
made
to
the
machinery
a
number
of
ways
but
our
contention
which
i
will
shortly
develop
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
our
contention
is
that
the
mathematical
procedure
which
respondents
are
claiming.
the
procedure
for
converting
from
one
form
of
mathematical
language
into
another
is
indeed
entirely
independent
of
the
machinery.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
independent
is
our
--
is
precisely
our
claim
and
i
will
develop
that
shortly.
that
is
the
basic
thrust
of
our
argument
mr.
chief
justice.
the
underlying
mathematical
technology
involved
in
respondents’
claim
as
explained
in
great
length
in
our
brief
and
in
respondents’
brief
and
though
there
is
some
difference
in
emphasis,
i
think
there
is
little
if
any
significant
difference
between
the
government
and
respondents
with
respect
to
the
technological
nature
of
the
claim
discovery.
furthermore,
though
the
technical
background
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
i
believe
it
would
help
place
respondents’
claim
in
its
proper
context.
the
technology
necessary
to
an
understanding
of
the
legal
issue
in
this
case,
is
i
think
simply
that
it
may
appear
and
i
will
briefly
describe
here
exactly
what
it
is
that
respondents
wish
to
patent.
a
computer
is
a
device
which
solves
problems
involving
either
numerical
information
or
other
kinds
of
data
which
can
be
broken
down
by
logic
into
numerical
form.
by
far,
the
most
common
type
of
computer
in
operation
today
is
the
digital
computer
which
its
name
implies,
operates
on
information
and
data
expressed
the
numerical
digits.
the
basic
function
of
a
computer
is
quite
simple
after
a
problem
has
been
broken
down
into
the
mathematical
steps
necessary
to
solve
that
problem.
the
computer
computes
the
solution
by
actually
doing
the
arithmetic,
though
it
is
an
enormously
elaborate
and
complicated
and
sophisticated
device,
the
modern
computer
itself
is
really
an
extension
in
principle
of
the
old
adding
machine
or
calculator.
its
utility
lies
in
its
ability
to
perform
in
minutes
or
even
in
seconds’
calculations
which
would
require
years
to
perform
by
hand.
although
the
computer
represents
digits
and
numbers
in
physical
forms
such
as
for
example
by
series
of
electrical
pulses,
the
mathematical
processes
which
the
computer
performs
or
the
same
which
a
human
would
perform
except
that
they
are
expressed
by
means
of
the
physical
symbols
built
into
the
computer
which
uses
electrical
signals
for
example
in
a
manner
of
similar
to
the
way
in
which
we
use
pencil
and
paper.
thus,
the
machine
is
built
with
the
capacity
that
carry
out
a
wide
variety
of
arithmetical
calculations
but
though
the
machine
is
built
to
do
the
arithmetic
it
is
told
to
do.
the
machine
can’t
think.
it
cannot
solve
a
problem
unless
the
operator
breaks
that
problem
down
into
a
series
of
mathematical
or
logical
steps
for
the
computer
to
carry
out.
this
series
of
mathematical
steps
is
the
computers
instructions
or
as
it
is
popularly
known
in
the
trade
of
programming.
though
some
computers
are
built
to
carry
out
one
particular
program,
obviously,
the
greatest
utilities
in
general
purpose
of
computers
which
are
built
to
perform
a
wide
variety
of
programs
requiring
only
that
the
problems
be
broken
down
into
logical
mathematical
steps
and
translated
to
a
language
that
is
compatible
with
the
internal
physical
characteristics
of
a
computer.
this
brings
us
to
this
precise
subject
of
respondents’
claim.
in
the
great
majority
of
general
purpose
of
digital
computers,
the
simplest
and
most
convenient
means
of
physically
representing
numbers
is
in
switch
light
alternatives
such
as
the
presence
or
absence
of
an
electrical
signal
of
pulse
for
example
analogous
and
perhaps
more
understandable
terms
to
the
on
and
off
the
light
bulb.
for
this
reason,
data
used
within
the
digital
computer
is
ordinarily
recorded
not
by
means
of
our
decimal
number
system
but
instead
by
means
of
the
binary
number
system
which
expresses
numbers
and
terms
of
only
two
characters
0
and
1
which
can
be
easily
correlated
to
the
presence
or
absence
of
an
electrical
pulse
the
on
or
off
the
light
bulb
in
which
is
based
on
powers
of
the
number
2
rather
than
powers
of
the
number
10
like
our
decimal
number
system.
this
two
characters
as
i
say
are
easily
represented
in
the
computer
for
example
by
the
on
and
off
of
an
electrical
pulse.
now,
the
numbers
that
we
deal
with
in
our
daily
lives
ordinarily
in
decimal
form.
therefore,
much
of
the
data
which
we
feed
into
computers
has
to
be
converted
from
the
decimal
number
system
to
the
binary
number
system.
and
an
immediate
step
of
this
conversion
process
is
the
binary
code
decimal
--
binary-coded
decimal
number
system
which
is
a
combination
of
binary
and
decimal
numbers
and
that
it
expresses
the
ordinary
decimal
digits
in
binary
numerals
and
arranges
them
in
the
order
of
the
decimal
number
system.
thus,
the
number
53
for
example
would
consist
of
the
binary
representation
of
5
in
the
left
hand
place
and
the
binary
representation
of
3
in
the
right
hand
place.
it
is
frequently
desirable
to
convert
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
to
pure
binary
form.
respondents
have
discovered
a
mathematical
relationship
between
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
and
pure
binary
numbers.
they
have
translated
this
mathematical
relationship
or
theorem
into
a
mathematical
procedure
for
performing
the
conversion
of
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
to
binary
numbers.
what
they
are
claiming
in
their
claims
are
set
forth
to
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief
and
a
numerous
other
places
in
the
record
is
an
algorithm,
which
the
dictionary
defines
as
any
procedure
for
solving
a
given
type
of
mathematical
problem.
the
basic
step
in
respondents’
algorithm
as
we
show
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
is
the
repeated
multiplication
in
binary
according
to
the
rules
of
binary
by
the
decimal
number
10.
their
claim
would,
if
granted
give
them
a
monopoly
over
any
computer
program
based
on
this
mathematical
relationship
which
they
have
discovered.
now,
what
they
claim
is
not
exactly
a
computer
program
itself,
it
is
a
generalized
formulation
for
programs
which
solve
the
mathematical
problem
of
converting
from
one
form
of
numerical
representation,
binary-coded
decimal
to
another
form
of
a
numerical
representation
that
is
pure
binary.
now,
let
us
deal
with
precisely
what
it
is
that
the
patent
office
and
its
board
of
appeals
found
wrong
with
the
respondents
claim.
the
patent
law
defines
patentability
essentially
in
two
aspects.
first,
the
statute
sets
forth
at
35
u.s.c.
101
what
constitutes
patentable
subject
matter
that
is
what
types
of
invention
are
patentable.
then
there
are
other
provisions
notably
35
u.s.c.
102
and
103
which
set
forth
conditions
for
the
patentability
of
otherwise
qualified
subject
matter
and
which
are
essentially
that
the
invention
be
new,
that
it
be
useful
and
that
it
be
non-obvious.
the
patent
office
did
not
deal
here
with
the
issue
whether
the
algorithm
claim
by
respondents
is
new,
useful,
and
non-obvious
because
it
found
that
respondents
in
any
of
it
or
claiming
a
patent
or
non-patentable
subject
matter.
under
35
u.s.c.
101,
a
patentable
invention
must
be
a
“process
machine,
manufacturer
or
composition
of
matter.”
it
is
fundamental
axiom
of
the
patent
law,
originating
in
the
writings
of
thomas
jefferson
and
repeated
in
perhaps
the
most
consistent
theme
throughout
the
patent
decisions
of
this
court
that
ideas
including
scientific
principles
or
mathematical
formulas,
mental
processes
and
other
abstract
intellectual
concepts
are
not
patentable,
only
machines,
manufacturers,
composition
of
matter
or
processes.
now,
how
exactly
thus
respondents
claim
for
an
algorithm
for
converting
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
into
binary
numbers
fit
into
this
fundamental
distinction
between
a
non-patentable
abstract
mental
procedure
and
a
patentable
process
machine
manufacture
or
composition
of
matter.
clearly
their
mathematical
procedure
is
not
a
machine,
manufacturer
or
composition
as
those
three
are
all
tangible
products
or
substances.
the
only
question
is
whether
their
claimed
invention
is
a
“process”
within
the
meaning
of
35
u.s.c.
101
and
therefore
the
starting
point
of
this
inquiry
is
what
is
the
distinction
between
an
abstract
principle
or
mental
procedure
and
patentable
process,
the
statute
merely
defines
process
at
35
u.s.c.
100
to
include
“process
art
or
method”
which
brings
in
the
old
terminology
historically
used
synonymous
with
the
word
“process.”
obviously,
there
is
no
sharp
line
between
these
two
concepts.
i
need
that
every
process
and
i
suppose
every
tangible
products
such
as
a
machine
or
manufactured
article
embodies
and
can
be
explained
at
some
level
in
terms
of
abstract
principles.
but
in
the
case
of
machines
or
other
tangible
products
the
patent
is
not
granted
on
the
idea
but
on
the
tangible
object
itself.
so
that
the
ideas
themselves
are
not
monopolized
except
in
the
limited
tangible
form
in
which
they
are
embodied
in
the
machine
or
manufactured
product.
in
what
circumstances
then
may
patents
be
granted
on
processes?
in
other
words,
where
have
the
decided
cases
drawn
the
line
between
ideas
and
patentable
processes?
there
are
essentially
two
lines
of
cases
which
i
believe
cover
virtually
all
process
patents
that
have
been
granted.
first,
the
patent
office
has
granted
and
this
court
has
validated
patents
on
processes
which
involve
the
chemical
or
physical
transformation
of
tangible
substances
such
as
for
example
processes
for
the
vulcanization
of
rubber
to
conversion
of
patent
to
soap
or
the
grinding
of
flour
as
it
used
in
the
several
case
of
cochrane
and
deener.
these
cases
and
many
of
these
are
cited
at
pages
67
of
our
reply
brief.
consistently
emphasized,
the
court’s
conception
of
a
patentable
process
is
a
series
of
acts
to
be
performed
on
a
tangible
substance
to
change
of
its
physical
properties
in
some
way
and
that
concept
is
expressly
articulated
in
the
leading
decision
of
cochrane
and
deener
at
94
u.s.
the
rationalities
decisions
is
that
when
a
process
deals
with
the
transformation
of
a
specific
substances
by
specific
physical
acts,
a
patent
on
that
process
has
a
finiteness,
a
forcibility
of
scope
and
a
tangible
quality
that
distinguishes
it
from
a
patent
on
a
pure
idea.
the
other
line
of
cases
which
must
be
considered
here
in
the
context
of
process
patents
are
those
19th
century
landmark
cases
in
which
process
patents
were
granted
to
mr.
morse
connection
with
his
invention
of
the
telegraph
and
to
mr.
bell
in
connection
with
his
invention
of
the
telephone.
the
inventions
claimed
in
these
cases
were
series
of
steps
performed
on
electric
currents
to
produce
physical
reactions,
in
one
case
to
print
letters
at
a
distance
and
in
one
case
to
produce
sound
at
a
distance.
in
our
view
of
these
cases
are
really
analogous
to
cases
such
as
cochrane
and
deener
which
involved
the
physical
transformation
of
substances
because
the
invented
element
in
these
cases
was
in
the
physical
manipulation
of
electric
signals,
in
our
case
by
contrast
electricity
is
really
an
arbitrary
means
of
symbol
by
which
numbers
in
mathematical
operations
are
physically
represented.
the
invented
element
in
respondents
claim
is
not
in
the
physical
manipulation
of
electricity
but
rather
in
the
mathematical
steps
which
the
computer
carries
out
under
respondents
instructions
with
the
physical
symbols
that
are
already
built-in
to
the
computer
but
even
assuming
that
the
morse
and
telephone
cases
were
analogous
to
our
case
and
avoiding
a
metaphysical
argument
over
the
tangible
or
intangible
nature
of
electric
pulses.
these
cases
granted
claims
only
on
those
processes
which
were
limited
by
reference
to
a
specific
apparatus
in
envious
and
this
is
the
discussed
at
great
length
in
our
brief.
for
this
reason,
mr.
morse
was
denied
a
patent
on
his
claim
8
--
his
claim
8
was
not
limited
to
operation
through
the
machinery
which
he
have
described
and
mr.
morse
was
going
rather
they
patent
on
his
first
claim
which
was
so
limited.
and
the
court
granted
in
mr.
bells
claims
on
processes
carried
out
by
means
of
the
two
specific
apparatuses
which
he
described.
for
in
this
cases,
as
in
that
case
is
such
as
cochrane
and
deener
on
which
patented
processes
for
transforming
physical
and
chemical
substances,
any
monopoly
that
might
have
been
granted
on
the
underlying
scientific
principles
was
limited
by
reference
to
tangible
apparatus.
and
now
finally,
what
is
it
that
respondents’
claim
here
as
a
patentable
process?
respondents
have
discovered
a
relationship
between
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
and
pure
binary
numbers
that
enables
them
to
convert
from
one
numerical
language
to
another
by
repeated
multiplication
according
to
the
rules
of
binary
multiplication
by
the
decimal
number
10
which
is
expressed
in
binary
form
as
1010.
the
algorithm
which
they
set
forth
in
their
claim
merely
translates
into
the
language
of
computer
programs
a
set
of
multiplications
and
additions
by
the
binary
equivalent
of
10.
though
there
is
no
time
here
to
explain
in
detail
why
respondents’
discovery
is
no
more
than
a
procedure
involving
multiplication
by
binary
1010.
the
court
need
not
except
this
conclusion
on
faith
for
it
is
fully
develop
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
where
we
analyze
respondents’
claims
step
by
step.
the
respondents
have
illustrated
their
claim
at
great
length
with
complicated
explanations
and
diagrams
and
charts.
they
have
not
contradicted
our
analysis
of
the
mathematical
procedure
that
they
claim
nor
had
they
denied
that
the
algorithm
described
in
their
claim
merely
translates
their
mathematical
discovery
into
the
language
of
computer
programming.
when
the
operator
tells
the
computer
to
add,
he
uses
words
like
shifting,
masking
and
storing.
these
words
do
not
change
the
mathematical
theorem
that
respondents
have
discovered
into
a
patentable
process.
any
more
than
one
changes
2+3
into
a
patentable
process
by
calling
it
(inaudible)
or
translating
it
into
some
other
foreign
language.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
there
claim
is
limited
to
operation
in
the
computer
field
because
the
only
words
in
that
--
in
one
of
their
claims
they
refer
to
shifting
in
a
shift
register
and
that
is
a
word
which
is
probably
related
at
least
to
general
purpose
digital
computers.
their
claim
13
has
no
such
limiting
reference.
i
supposed
if
there
are
impracticality,
their
claim
is
likely
to
be
carried
out
primarily
into
the
digital
computers
because
the
computations
are
very
elaborate.
but
even
if
that
is
the
case,
we
believe
that
the
general
purpose
of
digital
computers
is
trivial
limitation
on
the
claim
because
it’s
really
no
more
than
an
extension
of
an
adding
machine
or
calculator.
it’s
no
more
than
the
most
advance
device
we
have
for
calculating
extensive
mathematical
calculations
that
are
too
--
take
up
too
much
time
to
be
done
with
pencil
and
paper.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
patent
office
felt
that
the
respondents’
claims
could
be
carried
out
by
means
of
pencil
and
paper.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
would
agree
that
outside
of
the
computer
field
that
there
was
no
general
utility
known
right
now
for
this
process
other
than
carrying
out
calculations
on
a
computer
but
that
is
such
--
data
processing
itself
is
such
an
abstract
science
and
its
really
a
--
its
the
science
of
finding
answers
to
mathematical
problems
and
it’s
an
inherently,
the
information
that
is
fed
into
a
data
processor
is
inherently
non
patentable
in
the
most
extreme
sense
in
which
we
don’t
allow
patents
on
scientific
and
mathematical
ideas.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
the
computer
is
certainly
patentable
and
had
respondents
claimed
a
computer
for
carrying
out
this
process
which
was
new
and
useful
and
non-obvious,
they
certainly
could
have
been
given
a
patent
but
what
they
can’t
get
is
a
patent
for
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
suppose
they
could
have
--
if
they
have
invented
the
computer,
they
could
certainly
have
claimed
the
computer.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
they
haven’t
claim
the
computer
because
they
haven’t
invented
the
computer
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no.
very
simple,
mr.
justice
white,
it’s
not
a
new
use
of
an
old
machine
because
the
computer
is
built
to
carry
out
all
the
calculations
which
this
program
calls
for
being
carried
out.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no
more
than
an
adding
machine
is
doing
something
it
never
did
before
anymore
when
it
adds
a
series
of
numbers
that’s
never
added
before.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
mr.
justice
white
the
analogy
which
we
used
in
our
brief
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
appropriate
analogy,
is
an
old
play
of
piano
and
which
carries
out,
which
plays
songs
when
piano
rolls
are
inserted
into
it.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
computer
requires
a
new
function
every
time
it
carries
out
new
calculations
that
it
is
inherently
built
to
perform
anymore
than
a
play
of
piano
carries
out
a
new
function
acquires
a
new
use,
every
time
a
new
piano
rolls
is
inserted
into
it.
that
is
precisely
the
heart
of
our
case.
the
computer
and
the
machine
are
one
thing,
many
aspects
of
the
computer
and
the
machinery
are
patentable
but
the
computer
is
built
to
carry
out
through
physical
symbols
of
electricity
and
other
devices,
all
the
calculations
which
this
respondent
has
told
that
they
carry
out.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
precisely
the
same
machine
mr.
justice
white.
it’s
precisely
the
same
unit.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
understand
what
the
connection
between
those
two
propositions
is.
it’s
the
same
machine
because
it
is
inherently
able
to
carry
out
all
of
these
calculations.
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
built
and
designed
to
do.
it’s
the
same
machine
even
though
it’s
playing
different
music
or
carrying
out
different
calculations
exactly
the
same
way
that
an
adding
machine
is
the
same
machine
when
it
says
3+3
is
when
it
says
3+2.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
reduce
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
reduce
into
nothing,
the
math
--
the
underlying
mathematical
discoveries
that
are
involved
with
them
maybe
extremely
ingenious
and
extremely
important
and
extremely
useful
but
they
don’t
add
anything
to
a
computer,
they
are
mathematical
calculation
which
a
computer
is
already
there
to
carry
out.
indeed,
if
respondent
had
invented
the
pythagorean
theorem,
and
the
pythagorean
theorem
were
complicated
enough
so
that
it
could
only
be
carried
out
on
a
computer,
i
don’t
think
he
would
say
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
a
patent
on
pythagorean
theorem
merely
because
it
was
likely
to
be
carried
out
by
computer
or
that
the
computer
required
a
new
function
in
carrying
out
the
pythagorean
theorem
that
it
doesn’t
have
when
it
say
computing
the
area
of
the
circle.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
may
be
patentable
if
it
meets
all
the
necessary
qualifications
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
of
course
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
they’re
giving
a
patent
as
--
assuming
that
they
asked
--
that
it’s
white
--
the
device
itself
that
they
asked
for
patent
on,
they
are
given
a
patent
on
the
device.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
and
they
are
cases
if
all
they
have
discovered
is
that
certain
substances
in
the
combination
produces
certain
result.
it
maybe
that
they
don’t
get
a
patent
because
a
number
of
cases
such
as
the
funk
brothers
case
decide
333
u.s.
and
the
armour
case
at
396
f.2d
armour
versus
richardson-merrell
have
made
the
point
quite
forcefully
that
the
mere
discovery
of
a
better
combination
is
useful
is
not
patentable
in
itself
unless
they
are
some
element
of
invention
including
that
combination
together
or
some
synergistic
relationship
between
the
substances
that
makes
for
an
invention
other
than
the
pure
invention
of
the
mathematical
or
scientific
principle.
but
our
point
in
this
is
that
the
only
element
of
invention
in
respondents’
claim,
the
only
element
of
invention
in
this
algorithm
is
the
mathematical
invention
and
the
mathematical
theorem
itself.
there
is
no
element
of
invention
or
whatsoever
that
takes
place
subsequent
to
the
discovery
of
this
mathematical
process
and
therefore
it
is
not
unusual
arts
and
not
a
patentable
subject
matter.
we
have
touched
upon
these
subjects
already
in
the
questioning
but
the
respondents
basically
described
their
mathematical
procedure
as
a
machine
process
and
do
a
number
of
other
and
take
another
steps
to
describe
their
claims
and
ways
that
make
it
look
like
more
than
pure
mathematics.
one
which
we’ve
already
touch
upon
and
questioning
by
mr.
justice
white
is
that
they
imply
that
it’s
a
machine
process
rather
than
a
mathematical
process
because
it
is
in
effect
creates
a
new
use
for
the
machine.
as
i’ve
said
these
instructions
which
respondent
has
devised
really
contribute
nothing
and
to
the
operation
of
this
machine
because
the
computer
was
always
able
to
carry
out
these
steps
before
the
programs
of
the
respondents
have
invented
was
ever
devised.
respondents
have
never
denied
this
indeed
they
admitted
in
the
court
below
when
they
stated
in
their
brief
that
all
of
the
recited
single
manipulations
are
conventional
operations
which
performed
by
conventional
electronic
apparatus.
they
also
alleged
the
steps
which
they
set
forth
are
not
strictly
mathematical
but
a
machine
steps
because
they
carried
out
by
means
of
electricity
in
the
machine.
as
we
have
said,
the
invented
element
in
respondents
claim
is
entirely
mathematical
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
electricity.
respondents
have
not
invented
the
technique
for
carrying
out
their
calculations
on
the
machine.
that
was
done
by
inventor
of
the
digital
computer.
indeed,
virtually
everything
that
respondents
claim
as
inventible
other
than
mathematics
and
as
patentable
other
than
mathematics
in
this
lawsuit
was
invented
by
the
inventor
of
the
digital
computer
and
not
by
respondents.
electricity
as
i’ve
said
is
merely
that
writing
medium
was
the
computer
uses
to
perform
the
mathematical
steps
that
respondents
have
devised
and
no
more
imports
patentability
to
respondents
theorem
to
translate
it
into
a
computer
algorithm
of
program
anymore
that
it
would
import
patent
ability
to
the
equation
“a
equals
pi
r
squared”
to
translate
it
into
a
computer
algorithm
for
determining
the
area
of
the
circle.
respondents
also
attempt
to
make
a
patentable
process
out
of
their
theorem
by
referring
repeatedly
in
their
brief
to
the
especial
private
exchange
telephone
system
called
the
pbx
which
includes
the
digital
computer
apparatus
that
respondents
alleged
they
--
algorithm
is
especially
designed
to
accommodate.
they
seem
to
imply
that
they
are
claiming
the
patent
on
this
mathematical
procedure
only
as
is
used
in
this
pbx
device
if
indeed
they’re
not
implying
that
their
claim
is
in
some
way
analogous
to
a
claim
on
the
pbx
itself.
the
fact
is
that
their
claim
makes
no
reference
or
whatsoever
to
the
pbx
device
or
indeed
to
any
other
device
and
it
brought
a
sense
that
can
be
read
perhaps
to
refer
cooperation
on
a
digital
computer
but
we
do
not
believe
that
that
limitation
would
give
respondents
invention
and
tangibility
anymore
than
no
limitation
at
all
because
if
they
have
a
monopoly
on
this
procedure
is
carried
out
in
a
digital
computer,
they
have
an
effect
a
monopoly
on
the
theorem
itself.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
there
is
no
invention
in
this
process
other
than
a
mathematical
invention.
their
invention
adds
nothing
to
the
digital
computer
except
in
the
sense
that
it
gives
the
digital
computer
another
operation
to
carry
out
which
the
digital
computer
is
built
to
carry
out
inherently
and
which
really
amounts
to
know
more
than
the
normal
inherent
operation
of
that
digital
computer.
for
this
reason,
we
believe
the
decision
reason
below
should
be
reversed.
i
would
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
essence
of
the
conflict
in
this
case
is
reflected
here
in
this
oral
argument
as
intensively
as
it
can
be.
and
that
is
that
respondents
have
attempted
repeatedly
throughout
their
briefs
and
in
their
oral
argument
to
its
current
effect
that
the
invention
which
they
have
come
up
with
and
which
they
claim
in
this
case
as
an
invention
purely
mathematical
in
nature.
they
have
used
repeatedly
essentially
two
methods
to
try
to
relate
this
invention
to
machinery
on
which
doubtless
there
are
many
possible
and
permissible
inappropriate
patents.
first,
they
have
as
they
have
given
that
brief
i
refer
it
extensively
to
this
pbx
telecom
switching
system
which
they
alleged
that
this
patent
was
very
specifically
designed
to
accommodate
because
of
certain
problems
and
limitations
of
that
pbx
machinery
itself.
our
response
to
this
is
quite
clearly
and
simply
that
their
claim
makes
no
mention
or
whatsoever
of
the
pbx
device.
it
has
nothing
to
do
as
far
as
we
can
determine
from
the
pbx
device
it
granted
it
would
cover
the
use
of
this
mathematical
procedure
and
any
type
of
digital
computer
and
would
certainly
not
be
limited
to
the
pbx.
even
if
it
were
limited
to
the
pbx,
the
patent
office
would
perhaps
hear
arguments
as
to
why
there
was
some
special
synergistic
relationship
between
this
program
and
the
pbx
device
and
if
respondents
could
prove
some
synergistic
relationship
that
would
import
an
element
of
invention
that
went
beyond
the
invention
of
their
mathematical
theorem
that
the
patent
office
might
be
presented
with
a
different
case.
we
are
highly
doubtful,
however
that
respondents
could
prove
such
a
synergistic
connection
between
this
algorithm
and
the
pbx
device.
in
any
event
they
have
not
claimed
any
limitation
whatsoever
to
the
pbx
device
and
we
are
therefore
unconcerned
with
the
underlying
motive
for
their
invention
and
for
their
discovery
of
this
particular
theorem.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
would
at
least
be
a
–
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
patent
office
would
certainly
have
heard
the
issue
whether
there
was
some
invented
element
beyond
the
pure
mathematical
invention
or
some
synergistic
relationship
between
the
claimed
machine
and
the
algorithm
which
would
import
patentability.
but
that
simply
is
not
present
in
this
case.
in
addition,
respondents
have
repeatedly
used
the
word
“machine
process”
which
i
reiterate
brings
up
the
implication
that
what
the
mathematical
steps
which
they
have
asked
this
machine
to
carry
out
and
instructed
this
machine
to
carry
out
import
a
new
function
of
some
sort
of
this
machine
and
are
related
in
some
way
to
an
invention
on
the
machinery
itself
there.
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
there
is
given
a
list
of
--
a
description
of
a
number
of
important
theoretical
discoveries
involving
mathematical
steps
used
for
example
to
predict
whether
which
are
so
complicated
and
so
long
to
carry
out
that
they
can
only
practically
be
done
on
what
is
today
known
as
the
digital
computer
are
most
complex
calculating
device.
if
respondents
are
entitled
to
a
patent
on
this
mathematical
procedure
merely
because
it
most
likely
to
be
carried
out
in
a
digital
computer
than
all
of
those
important
mathematical
discoveries,
as
well
as
other
important
mathematical
discoveries
which
are
likely
because
of
their
--
of
inherent
length
of
the
mathematical
calculations
to
be
carried
out
on
a
digital
computer
would
be
monopolized
and
taken
out
of
the
whelm
of
a
common
usage
even
though
they
have
nothing
inherently
to
do
with
machinery
except
that
they
are
likely
to
be
performed
on
machinery
that
has
already
been
invented
and
designed
to
carry
out
this
mathematical
steps.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
not
said
that.
all
i
have
said
is
that
if
it
had
been
limited
to
the
pbx,
then
it
would
have
been
appropriate
perhaps
to
make
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
was
some
special
relationship
between
respondents
discovering
in
the
pbx
which
would
import
an
inventive
element
other
than
the
mere
mathematical
discovery
to
their
claim
and
perhaps
warranted
patentability.
i
always
say
that
this
might
have
been
a
different
case
but
that’s
not
the
case
before
us.
and
finally
the
competitive,
the
problems
of
the
competitive
status
of
the
software
industry
which
respondents
have
alluded
to
are
indeed
important
problems
which
of
course
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
the
government
is
quite
concerned
with.
our
view
is
simply,
that
the
solution
to
these
competitive
problems
is
not
to
grant
undeserved
monopolies
on
mathematical
principles.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
in
a
somewhat
unusual
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
raises
the
question
whether
respondents
are
in
entitled
to
a
patent
on
a
method
which
they
have
devised
for
converting
numerical
information
expressed
in
one
form
of
mathematical
language
into
another
mathematical
language.
both
of
which
languages
are
used
extensively
in
general
purpose
digital
computers.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
our
bet
is
precisely
--
our
contention
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
what
respondents
have
claimed
here
is
simply
a
set
of
steps
to
be
carried
out
in
a
machine.
they
have
tried
to
link
the
claim
that
they
have
made
to
the
machinery
a
number
of
ways
but
our
contention
which
i
will
shortly
develop
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
our
contention
is
that
the
mathematical
procedure
which
respondents
are
claiming.
the
procedure
for
converting
from
one
form
of
mathematical
language
into
another
is
indeed
entirely
independent
of
the
machinery.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
independent
is
our
--
is
precisely
our
claim
and
i
will
develop
that
shortly.
that
is
the
basic
thrust
of
our
argument
mr.
chief
justice.
the
underlying
mathematical
technology
involved
in
respondents’
claim
as
explained
in
great
length
in
our
brief
and
in
respondents’
brief
and
though
there
is
some
difference
in
emphasis,
i
think
there
is
little
if
any
significant
difference
between
the
government
and
respondents
with
respect
to
the
technological
nature
of
the
claim
discovery.
furthermore,
though
the
technical
background
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
i
believe
it
would
help
place
respondents’
claim
in
its
proper
context.
the
technology
necessary
to
an
understanding
of
the
legal
issue
in
this
case,
is
i
think
simply
that
it
may
appear
and
i
will
briefly
describe
here
exactly
what
it
is
that
respondents
wish
to
patent.
a
computer
is
a
device
which
solves
problems
involving
either
numerical
information
or
other
kinds
of
data
which
can
be
broken
down
by
logic
into
numerical
form.
by
far,
the
most
common
type
of
computer
in
operation
today
is
the
digital
computer
which
its
name
implies,
operates
on
information
and
data
expressed
the
numerical
digits.
the
basic
function
of
a
computer
is
quite
simple
after
a
problem
has
been
broken
down
into
the
mathematical
steps
necessary
to
solve
that
problem.
the
computer
computes
the
solution
by
actually
doing
the
arithmetic,
though
it
is
an
enormously
elaborate
and
complicated
and
sophisticated
device,
the
modern
computer
itself
is
really
an
extension
in
principle
of
the
old
adding
machine
or
calculator.
its
utility
lies
in
its
ability
to
perform
in
minutes
or
even
in
seconds’
calculations
which
would
require
years
to
perform
by
hand.
although
the
computer
represents
digits
and
numbers
in
physical
forms
such
as
for
example
by
series
of
electrical
pulses,
the
mathematical
processes
which
the
computer
performs
or
the
same
which
a
human
would
perform
except
that
they
are
expressed
by
means
of
the
physical
symbols
built
into
the
computer
which
uses
electrical
signals
for
example
in
a
manner
of
similar
to
the
way
in
which
we
use
pencil
and
paper.
thus,
the
machine
is
built
with
the
capacity
that
carry
out
a
wide
variety
of
arithmetical
calculations
but
though
the
machine
is
built
to
do
the
arithmetic
it
is
told
to
do.
the
machine
can’t
think.
it
cannot
solve
a
problem
unless
the
operator
breaks
that
problem
down
into
a
series
of
mathematical
or
logical
steps
for
the
computer
to
carry
out.
this
series
of
mathematical
steps
is
the
computers
instructions
or
as
it
is
popularly
known
in
the
trade
of
programming.
though
some
computers
are
built
to
carry
out
one
particular
program,
obviously,
the
greatest
utilities
in
general
purpose
of
computers
which
are
built
to
perform
a
wide
variety
of
programs
requiring
only
that
the
problems
be
broken
down
into
logical
mathematical
steps
and
translated
to
a
language
that
is
compatible
with
the
internal
physical
characteristics
of
a
computer.
this
brings
us
to
this
precise
subject
of
respondents’
claim.
in
the
great
majority
of
general
purpose
of
digital
computers,
the
simplest
and
most
convenient
means
of
physically
representing
numbers
is
in
switch
light
alternatives
such
as
the
presence
or
absence
of
an
electrical
signal
of
pulse
for
example
analogous
and
perhaps
more
understandable
terms
to
the
on
and
off
the
light
bulb.
for
this
reason,
data
used
within
the
digital
computer
is
ordinarily
recorded
not
by
means
of
our
decimal
number
system
but
instead
by
means
of
the
binary
number
system
which
expresses
numbers
and
terms
of
only
two
characters
0
and
1
which
can
be
easily
correlated
to
the
presence
or
absence
of
an
electrical
pulse
the
on
or
off
the
light
bulb
in
which
is
based
on
powers
of
the
number
2
rather
than
powers
of
the
number
10
like
our
decimal
number
system.
this
two
characters
as
i
say
are
easily
represented
in
the
computer
for
example
by
the
on
and
off
of
an
electrical
pulse.
now,
the
numbers
that
we
deal
with
in
our
daily
lives
ordinarily
in
decimal
form.
therefore,
much
of
the
data
which
we
feed
into
computers
has
to
be
converted
from
the
decimal
number
system
to
the
binary
number
system.
and
an
immediate
step
of
this
conversion
process
is
the
binary
code
decimal
--
binary-coded
decimal
number
system
which
is
a
combination
of
binary
and
decimal
numbers
and
that
it
expresses
the
ordinary
decimal
digits
in
binary
numerals
and
arranges
them
in
the
order
of
the
decimal
number
system.
thus,
the
number
53
for
example
would
consist
of
the
binary
representation
of
5
in
the
left
hand
place
and
the
binary
representation
of
3
in
the
right
hand
place.
it
is
frequently
desirable
to
convert
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
to
pure
binary
form.
respondents
have
discovered
a
mathematical
relationship
between
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
and
pure
binary
numbers.
they
have
translated
this
mathematical
relationship
or
theorem
into
a
mathematical
procedure
for
performing
the
conversion
of
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
to
binary
numbers.
what
they
are
claiming
in
their
claims
are
set
forth
to
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief
and
a
numerous
other
places
in
the
record
is
an
algorithm,
which
the
dictionary
defines
as
any
procedure
for
solving
a
given
type
of
mathematical
problem.
the
basic
step
in
respondents’
algorithm
as
we
show
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
is
the
repeated
multiplication
in
binary
according
to
the
rules
of
binary
by
the
decimal
number
10.
their
claim
would,
if
granted
give
them
a
monopoly
over
any
computer
program
based
on
this
mathematical
relationship
which
they
have
discovered.
now,
what
they
claim
is
not
exactly
a
computer
program
itself,
it
is
a
generalized
formulation
for
programs
which
solve
the
mathematical
problem
of
converting
from
one
form
of
numerical
representation,
binary-coded
decimal
to
another
form
of
a
numerical
representation
that
is
pure
binary.
now,
let
us
deal
with
precisely
what
it
is
that
the
patent
office
and
its
board
of
appeals
found
wrong
with
the
respondents
claim.
the
patent
law
defines
patentability
essentially
in
two
aspects.
first,
the
statute
sets
forth
at
35
u.s.c.
101
what
constitutes
patentable
subject
matter
that
is
what
types
of
invention
are
patentable.
then
there
are
other
provisions
notably
35
u.s.c.
102
and
103
which
set
forth
conditions
for
the
patentability
of
otherwise
qualified
subject
matter
and
which
are
essentially
that
the
invention
be
new,
that
it
be
useful
and
that
it
be
non-obvious.
the
patent
office
did
not
deal
here
with
the
issue
whether
the
algorithm
claim
by
respondents
is
new,
useful,
and
non-obvious
because
it
found
that
respondents
in
any
of
it
or
claiming
a
patent
or
non-patentable
subject
matter.
under
35
u.s.c.
101,
a
patentable
invention
must
be
a
“process
machine,
manufacturer
or
composition
of
matter.”
it
is
fundamental
axiom
of
the
patent
law,
originating
in
the
writings
of
thomas
jefferson
and
repeated
in
perhaps
the
most
consistent
theme
throughout
the
patent
decisions
of
this
court
that
ideas
including
scientific
principles
or
mathematical
formulas,
mental
processes
and
other
abstract
intellectual
concepts
are
not
patentable,
only
machines,
manufacturers,
composition
of
matter
or
processes.
now,
how
exactly
thus
respondents
claim
for
an
algorithm
for
converting
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
into
binary
numbers
fit
into
this
fundamental
distinction
between
a
non-patentable
abstract
mental
procedure
and
a
patentable
process
machine
manufacture
or
composition
of
matter.
clearly
their
mathematical
procedure
is
not
a
machine,
manufacturer
or
composition
as
those
three
are
all
tangible
products
or
substances.
the
only
question
is
whether
their
claimed
invention
is
a
“process”
within
the
meaning
of
35
u.s.c.
101
and
therefore
the
starting
point
of
this
inquiry
is
what
is
the
distinction
between
an
abstract
principle
or
mental
procedure
and
patentable
process,
the
statute
merely
defines
process
at
35
u.s.c.
100
to
include
“process
art
or
method”
which
brings
in
the
old
terminology
historically
used
synonymous
with
the
word
“process.”
obviously,
there
is
no
sharp
line
between
these
two
concepts.
i
need
that
every
process
and
i
suppose
every
tangible
products
such
as
a
machine
or
manufactured
article
embodies
and
can
be
explained
at
some
level
in
terms
of
abstract
principles.
but
in
the
case
of
machines
or
other
tangible
products
the
patent
is
not
granted
on
the
idea
but
on
the
tangible
object
itself.
so
that
the
ideas
themselves
are
not
monopolized
except
in
the
limited
tangible
form
in
which
they
are
embodied
in
the
machine
or
manufactured
product.
in
what
circumstances
then
may
patents
be
granted
on
processes?
in
other
words,
where
have
the
decided
cases
drawn
the
line
between
ideas
and
patentable
processes?
there
are
essentially
two
lines
of
cases
which
i
believe
cover
virtually
all
process
patents
that
have
been
granted.
first,
the
patent
office
has
granted
and
this
court
has
validated
patents
on
processes
which
involve
the
chemical
or
physical
transformation
of
tangible
substances
such
as
for
example
processes
for
the
vulcanization
of
rubber
to
conversion
of
patent
to
soap
or
the
grinding
of
flour
as
it
used
in
the
several
case
of
cochrane
and
deener.
these
cases
and
many
of
these
are
cited
at
pages
67
of
our
reply
brief.
consistently
emphasized,
the
court’s
conception
of
a
patentable
process
is
a
series
of
acts
to
be
performed
on
a
tangible
substance
to
change
of
its
physical
properties
in
some
way
and
that
concept
is
expressly
articulated
in
the
leading
decision
of
cochrane
and
deener
at
94
u.s.
the
rationalities
decisions
is
that
when
a
process
deals
with
the
transformation
of
a
specific
substances
by
specific
physical
acts,
a
patent
on
that
process
has
a
finiteness,
a
forcibility
of
scope
and
a
tangible
quality
that
distinguishes
it
from
a
patent
on
a
pure
idea.
the
other
line
of
cases
which
must
be
considered
here
in
the
context
of
process
patents
are
those
19th
century
landmark
cases
in
which
process
patents
were
granted
to
mr.
morse
connection
with
his
invention
of
the
telegraph
and
to
mr.
bell
in
connection
with
his
invention
of
the
telephone.
the
inventions
claimed
in
these
cases
were
series
of
steps
performed
on
electric
currents
to
produce
physical
reactions,
in
one
case
to
print
letters
at
a
distance
and
in
one
case
to
produce
sound
at
a
distance.
in
our
view
of
these
cases
are
really
analogous
to
cases
such
as
cochrane
and
deener
which
involved
the
physical
transformation
of
substances
because
the
invented
element
in
these
cases
was
in
the
physical
manipulation
of
electric
signals,
in
our
case
by
contrast
electricity
is
really
an
arbitrary
means
of
symbol
by
which
numbers
in
mathematical
operations
are
physically
represented.
the
invented
element
in
respondents
claim
is
not
in
the
physical
manipulation
of
electricity
but
rather
in
the
mathematical
steps
which
the
computer
carries
out
under
respondents
instructions
with
the
physical
symbols
that
are
already
built-in
to
the
computer
but
even
assuming
that
the
morse
and
telephone
cases
were
analogous
to
our
case
and
avoiding
a
metaphysical
argument
over
the
tangible
or
intangible
nature
of
electric
pulses.
these
cases
granted
claims
only
on
those
processes
which
were
limited
by
reference
to
a
specific
apparatus
in
envious
and
this
is
the
discussed
at
great
length
in
our
brief.
for
this
reason,
mr.
morse
was
denied
a
patent
on
his
claim
8
--
his
claim
8
was
not
limited
to
operation
through
the
machinery
which
he
have
described
and
mr.
morse
was
going
rather
they
patent
on
his
first
claim
which
was
so
limited.
and
the
court
granted
in
mr.
bells
claims
on
processes
carried
out
by
means
of
the
two
specific
apparatuses
which
he
described.
for
in
this
cases,
as
in
that
case
is
such
as
cochrane
and
deener
on
which
patented
processes
for
transforming
physical
and
chemical
substances,
any
monopoly
that
might
have
been
granted
on
the
underlying
scientific
principles
was
limited
by
reference
to
tangible
apparatus.
and
now
finally,
what
is
it
that
respondents’
claim
here
as
a
patentable
process?
respondents
have
discovered
a
relationship
between
binary-coded
decimal
numbers
and
pure
binary
numbers
that
enables
them
to
convert
from
one
numerical
language
to
another
by
repeated
multiplication
according
to
the
rules
of
binary
multiplication
by
the
decimal
number
10
which
is
expressed
in
binary
form
as
1010.
the
algorithm
which
they
set
forth
in
their
claim
merely
translates
into
the
language
of
computer
programs
a
set
of
multiplications
and
additions
by
the
binary
equivalent
of
10.
though
there
is
no
time
here
to
explain
in
detail
why
respondents’
discovery
is
no
more
than
a
procedure
involving
multiplication
by
binary
1010.
the
court
need
not
except
this
conclusion
on
faith
for
it
is
fully
develop
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
where
we
analyze
respondents’
claims
step
by
step.
the
respondents
have
illustrated
their
claim
at
great
length
with
complicated
explanations
and
diagrams
and
charts.
they
have
not
contradicted
our
analysis
of
the
mathematical
procedure
that
they
claim
nor
had
they
denied
that
the
algorithm
described
in
their
claim
merely
translates
their
mathematical
discovery
into
the
language
of
computer
programming.
when
the
operator
tells
the
computer
to
add,
he
uses
words
like
shifting,
masking
and
storing.
these
words
do
not
change
the
mathematical
theorem
that
respondents
have
discovered
into
a
patentable
process.
any
more
than
one
changes
2+3
into
a
patentable
process
by
calling
it
(inaudible)
or
translating
it
into
some
other
foreign
language.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
there
claim
is
limited
to
operation
in
the
computer
field
because
the
only
words
in
that
--
in
one
of
their
claims
they
refer
to
shifting
in
a
shift
register
and
that
is
a
word
which
is
probably
related
at
least
to
general
purpose
digital
computers.
their
claim
13
has
no
such
limiting
reference.
i
supposed
if
there
are
impracticality,
their
claim
is
likely
to
be
carried
out
primarily
into
the
digital
computers
because
the
computations
are
very
elaborate.
but
even
if
that
is
the
case,
we
believe
that
the
general
purpose
of
digital
computers
is
trivial
limitation
on
the
claim
because
it’s
really
no
more
than
an
extension
of
an
adding
machine
or
calculator.
it’s
no
more
than
the
most
advance
device
we
have
for
calculating
extensive
mathematical
calculations
that
are
too
--
take
up
too
much
time
to
be
done
with
pencil
and
paper.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
patent
office
felt
that
the
respondents’
claims
could
be
carried
out
by
means
of
pencil
and
paper.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
would
agree
that
outside
of
the
computer
field
that
there
was
no
general
utility
known
right
now
for
this
process
other
than
carrying
out
calculations
on
a
computer
but
that
is
such
--
data
processing
itself
is
such
an
abstract
science
and
its
really
a
--
its
the
science
of
finding
answers
to
mathematical
problems
and
it’s
an
inherently,
the
information
that
is
fed
into
a
data
processor
is
inherently
non
patentable
in
the
most
extreme
sense
in
which
we
don’t
allow
patents
on
scientific
and
mathematical
ideas.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
the
computer
is
certainly
patentable
and
had
respondents
claimed
a
computer
for
carrying
out
this
process
which
was
new
and
useful
and
non-obvious,
they
certainly
could
have
been
given
a
patent
but
what
they
can’t
get
is
a
patent
for
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
suppose
they
could
have
--
if
they
have
invented
the
computer,
they
could
certainly
have
claimed
the
computer.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
they
haven’t
claim
the
computer
because
they
haven’t
invented
the
computer
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no.
very
simple,
mr.
justice
white,
it’s
not
a
new
use
of
an
old
machine
because
the
computer
is
built
to
carry
out
all
the
calculations
which
this
program
calls
for
being
carried
out.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no
more
than
an
adding
machine
is
doing
something
it
never
did
before
anymore
when
it
adds
a
series
of
numbers
that’s
never
added
before.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
mr.
justice
white
the
analogy
which
we
used
in
our
brief
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
appropriate
analogy,
is
an
old
play
of
piano
and
which
carries
out,
which
plays
songs
when
piano
rolls
are
inserted
into
it.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
computer
requires
a
new
function
every
time
it
carries
out
new
calculations
that
it
is
inherently
built
to
perform
anymore
than
a
play
of
piano
carries
out
a
new
function
acquires
a
new
use,
every
time
a
new
piano
rolls
is
inserted
into
it.
that
is
precisely
the
heart
of
our
case.
the
computer
and
the
machine
are
one
thing,
many
aspects
of
the
computer
and
the
machinery
are
patentable
but
the
computer
is
built
to
carry
out
through
physical
symbols
of
electricity
and
other
devices,
all
the
calculations
which
this
respondent
has
told
that
they
carry
out.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
precisely
the
same
machine
mr.
justice
white.
it’s
precisely
the
same
unit.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
understand
what
the
connection
between
those
two
propositions
is.
it’s
the
same
machine
because
it
is
inherently
able
to
carry
out
all
of
these
calculations.
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
built
and
designed
to
do.
it’s
the
same
machine
even
though
it’s
playing
different
music
or
carrying
out
different
calculations
exactly
the
same
way
that
an
adding
machine
is
the
same
machine
when
it
says
3+3
is
when
it
says
3+2.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
reduce
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
reduce
into
nothing,
the
math
--
the
underlying
mathematical
discoveries
that
are
involved
with
them
maybe
extremely
ingenious
and
extremely
important
and
extremely
useful
but
they
don’t
add
anything
to
a
computer,
they
are
mathematical
calculation
which
a
computer
is
already
there
to
carry
out.
indeed,
if
respondent
had
invented
the
pythagorean
theorem,
and
the
pythagorean
theorem
were
complicated
enough
so
that
it
could
only
be
carried
out
on
a
computer,
i
don’t
think
he
would
say
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
a
patent
on
pythagorean
theorem
merely
because
it
was
likely
to
be
carried
out
by
computer
or
that
the
computer
required
a
new
function
in
carrying
out
the
pythagorean
theorem
that
it
doesn’t
have
when
it
say
computing
the
area
of
the
circle.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
may
be
patentable
if
it
meets
all
the
necessary
qualifications
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
of
course
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
they’re
giving
a
patent
as
--
assuming
that
they
asked
--
that
it’s
white
--
the
device
itself
that
they
asked
for
patent
on,
they
are
given
a
patent
on
the
device.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
and
they
are
cases
if
all
they
have
discovered
is
that
certain
substances
in
the
combination
produces
certain
result.
it
maybe
that
they
don’t
get
a
patent
because
a
number
of
cases
such
as
the
funk
brothers
case
decide
333
u.s.
and
the
armour
case
at
396
f.2d
armour
versus
richardson-merrell
have
made
the
point
quite
forcefully
that
the
mere
discovery
of
a
better
combination
is
useful
is
not
patentable
in
itself
unless
they
are
some
element
of
invention
including
that
combination
together
or
some
synergistic
relationship
between
the
substances
that
makes
for
an
invention
other
than
the
pure
invention
of
the
mathematical
or
scientific
principle.
but
our
point
in
this
is
that
the
only
element
of
invention
in
respondents’
claim,
the
only
element
of
invention
in
this
algorithm
is
the
mathematical
invention
and
the
mathematical
theorem
itself.
there
is
no
element
of
invention
or
whatsoever
that
takes
place
subsequent
to
the
discovery
of
this
mathematical
process
and
therefore
it
is
not
unusual
arts
and
not
a
patentable
subject
matter.
we
have
touched
upon
these
subjects
already
in
the
questioning
but
the
respondents
basically
described
their
mathematical
procedure
as
a
machine
process
and
do
a
number
of
other
and
take
another
steps
to
describe
their
claims
and
ways
that
make
it
look
like
more
than
pure
mathematics.
one
which
we’ve
already
touch
upon
and
questioning
by
mr.
justice
white
is
that
they
imply
that
it’s
a
machine
process
rather
than
a
mathematical
process
because
it
is
in
effect
creates
a
new
use
for
the
machine.
as
i’ve
said
these
instructions
which
respondent
has
devised
really
contribute
nothing
and
to
the
operation
of
this
machine
because
the
computer
was
always
able
to
carry
out
these
steps
before
the
programs
of
the
respondents
have
invented
was
ever
devised.
respondents
have
never
denied
this
indeed
they
admitted
in
the
court
below
when
they
stated
in
their
brief
that
all
of
the
recited
single
manipulations
are
conventional
operations
which
performed
by
conventional
electronic
apparatus.
they
also
alleged
the
steps
which
they
set
forth
are
not
strictly
mathematical
but
a
machine
steps
because
they
carried
out
by
means
of
electricity
in
the
machine.
as
we
have
said,
the
invented
element
in
respondents
claim
is
entirely
mathematical
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
electricity.
respondents
have
not
invented
the
technique
for
carrying
out
their
calculations
on
the
machine.
that
was
done
by
inventor
of
the
digital
computer.
indeed,
virtually
everything
that
respondents
claim
as
inventible
other
than
mathematics
and
as
patentable
other
than
mathematics
in
this
lawsuit
was
invented
by
the
inventor
of
the
digital
computer
and
not
by
respondents.
electricity
as
i’ve
said
is
merely
that
writing
medium
was
the
computer
uses
to
perform
the
mathematical
steps
that
respondents
have
devised
and
no
more
imports
patentability
to
respondents
theorem
to
translate
it
into
a
computer
algorithm
of
program
anymore
that
it
would
import
patent
ability
to
the
equation
“a
equals
pi
r
squared”
to
translate
it
into
a
computer
algorithm
for
determining
the
area
of
the
circle.
respondents
also
attempt
to
make
a
patentable
process
out
of
their
theorem
by
referring
repeatedly
in
their
brief
to
the
especial
private
exchange
telephone
system
called
the
pbx
which
includes
the
digital
computer
apparatus
that
respondents
alleged
they
--
algorithm
is
especially
designed
to
accommodate.
they
seem
to
imply
that
they
are
claiming
the
patent
on
this
mathematical
procedure
only
as
is
used
in
this
pbx
device
if
indeed
they’re
not
implying
that
their
claim
is
in
some
way
analogous
to
a
claim
on
the
pbx
itself.
the
fact
is
that
their
claim
makes
no
reference
or
whatsoever
to
the
pbx
device
or
indeed
to
any
other
device
and
it
brought
a
sense
that
can
be
read
perhaps
to
refer
cooperation
on
a
digital
computer
but
we
do
not
believe
that
that
limitation
would
give
respondents
invention
and
tangibility
anymore
than
no
limitation
at
all
because
if
they
have
a
monopoly
on
this
procedure
is
carried
out
in
a
digital
computer,
they
have
an
effect
a
monopoly
on
the
theorem
itself.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
there
is
no
invention
in
this
process
other
than
a
mathematical
invention.
their
invention
adds
nothing
to
the
digital
computer
except
in
the
sense
that
it
gives
the
digital
computer
another
operation
to
carry
out
which
the
digital
computer
is
built
to
carry
out
inherently
and
which
really
amounts
to
know
more
than
the
normal
inherent
operation
of
that
digital
computer.
for
this
reason,
we
believe
the
decision
reason
below
should
be
reversed.
i
would
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
essence
of
the
conflict
in
this
case
is
reflected
here
in
this
oral
argument
as
intensively
as
it
can
be.
and
that
is
that
respondents
have
attempted
repeatedly
throughout
their
briefs
and
in
their
oral
argument
to
its
current
effect
that
the
invention
which
they
have
come
up
with
and
which
they
claim
in
this
case
as
an
invention
purely
mathematical
in
nature.
they
have
used
repeatedly
essentially
two
methods
to
try
to
relate
this
invention
to
machinery
on
which
doubtless
there
are
many
possible
and
permissible
inappropriate
patents.
first,
they
have
as
they
have
given
that
brief
i
refer
it
extensively
to
this
pbx
telecom
switching
system
which
they
alleged
that
this
patent
was
very
specifically
designed
to
accommodate
because
of
certain
problems
and
limitations
of
that
pbx
machinery
itself.
our
response
to
this
is
quite
clearly
and
simply
that
their
claim
makes
no
mention
or
whatsoever
of
the
pbx
device.
it
has
nothing
to
do
as
far
as
we
can
determine
from
the
pbx
device
it
granted
it
would
cover
the
use
of
this
mathematical
procedure
and
any
type
of
digital
computer
and
would
certainly
not
be
limited
to
the
pbx.
even
if
it
were
limited
to
the
pbx,
the
patent
office
would
perhaps
hear
arguments
as
to
why
there
was
some
special
synergistic
relationship
between
this
program
and
the
pbx
device
and
if
respondents
could
prove
some
synergistic
relationship
that
would
import
an
element
of
invention
that
went
beyond
the
invention
of
their
mathematical
theorem
that
the
patent
office
might
be
presented
with
a
different
case.
we
are
highly
doubtful,
however
that
respondents
could
prove
such
a
synergistic
connection
between
this
algorithm
and
the
pbx
device.
in
any
event
they
have
not
claimed
any
limitation
whatsoever
to
the
pbx
device
and
we
are
therefore
unconcerned
with
the
underlying
motive
for
their
invention
and
for
their
discovery
of
this
particular
theorem.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
would
at
least
be
a
–
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
patent
office
would
certainly
have
heard
the
issue
whether
there
was
some
invented
element
beyond
the
pure
mathematical
invention
or
some
synergistic
relationship
between
the
claimed
machine
and
the
algorithm
which
would
import
patentability.
but
that
simply
is
not
present
in
this
case.
in
addition,
respondents
have
repeatedly
used
the
word
“machine
process”
which
i
reiterate
brings
up
the
implication
that
what
the
mathematical
steps
which
they
have
asked
this
machine
to
carry
out
and
instructed
this
machine
to
carry
out
import
a
new
function
of
some
sort
of
this
machine
and
are
related
in
some
way
to
an
invention
on
the
machinery
itself
there.
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
there
is
given
a
list
of
--
a
description
of
a
number
of
important
theoretical
discoveries
involving
mathematical
steps
used
for
example
to
predict
whether
which
are
so
complicated
and
so
long
to
carry
out
that
they
can
only
practically
be
done
on
what
is
today
known
as
the
digital
computer
are
most
complex
calculating
device.
if
respondents
are
entitled
to
a
patent
on
this
mathematical
procedure
merely
because
it
most
likely
to
be
carried
out
in
a
digital
computer
than
all
of
those
important
mathematical
discoveries,
as
well
as
other
important
mathematical
discoveries
which
are
likely
because
of
their
--
of
inherent
length
of
the
mathematical
calculations
to
be
carried
out
on
a
digital
computer
would
be
monopolized
and
taken
out
of
the
whelm
of
a
common
usage
even
though
they
have
nothing
inherently
to
do
with
machinery
except
that
they
are
likely
to
be
performed
on
machinery
that
has
already
been
invented
and
designed
to
carry
out
this
mathematical
steps.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
not
said
that.
all
i
have
said
is
that
if
it
had
been
limited
to
the
pbx,
then
it
would
have
been
appropriate
perhaps
to
make
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
was
some
special
relationship
between
respondents
discovering
in
the
pbx
which
would
import
an
inventive
element
other
than
the
mere
mathematical
discovery
to
their
claim
and
perhaps
warranted
patentability.
i
always
say
that
this
might
have
been
a
different
case
but
that’s
not
the
case
before
us.
and
finally
the
competitive,
the
problems
of
the
competitive
status
of
the
software
industry
which
respondents
have
alluded
to
are
indeed
important
problems
which
of
course
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
the
government
is
quite
concerned
with.
our
view
is
simply,
that
the
solution
to
these
competitive
problems
is
not
to
grant
undeserved
monopolies
on
mathematical
principles.
