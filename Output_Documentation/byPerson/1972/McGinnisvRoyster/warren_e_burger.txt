chief

how
does
the
state
institution
go
about
evaluating
the
good
behavior
of
a
man
who
is
not
in
their
custody?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
want
credit
for
it
even
though
they
have
no
way
of
evaluating
it,
isn’t
that
the
essence
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
be
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
during
the
11
months
period
this
behavior
was
good
as
defined
by
the
state
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
his
behavior
might
have
been
such
as
in
the
state
institution,
it
would
be
rated
as
very
bad.
you
concede
that,
i
take
it,
that
that
might
be
the
consequence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
classification
process,
at
the
detention
level,
as
have
the
state
level
when
they
get
into
the
penitentiary,
do
they
undertake
to
classify
people
in
categories
of
either
skills
or
psychological--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
in
the
jail
i
am
speaking
of.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
some
counties
in
new
york
or
some
places
where
they
have
as
a
detention
center,
something
less
than
a
jail
or
in
the
nature
of
dormitories
or
is
that
some
of
the
state
have
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
colodner.
mr.
sorge.
before
you
start
let
me
put
this
question
to
you
and
you
may
develop
the
reply
as
you
wish.
suppose
that
there
was
a
pretrial
detention
of
the
man
in
a
jail
in
france
subject
to
extradition
to
this
this
country,
and
it
took
6
months
to
get
them
extradited
out
of
france
back
to
new
york
for
trial
under
the
extradition
treaty,
would
you
make
the
same
arguments
there
that
you
are
making
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
after
lunch,
you
will
have
a
substantial
amount
of
time,
i
think.
[luncheon
recess]
you
have
some
time
left
mr.
sorge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
wouldn’t
apply
good
behavior
standards
to
people
confined
in
those
circumstances
ordinarily
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
not
a
reasonable
thing
to
do,
you
would
hardly
take
a
person
who
is
confined
because
he
is
mentally
incompetent
and
hold
him
to
the
standards
that
you
would
hold
normal
people.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
only
the
problem
in
that
area,
that
wouldn't
be
any
basis
for
holding
here,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
sorge.
chief

warren
e.

yes,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
