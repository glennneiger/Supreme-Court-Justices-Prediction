unknown
speaker
that's
true
of
every
county
in
part
of
the
new
york?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
mr.
colodner,
going
thorough
the
mathematics
of
this
argument,
i
take
it
that
when
it
comes
down
to
difference
between
you
and
your
opposition,
is
one
third
of
the
jail
time,
i
think
mathematically
this
is
where
the
argument
comes
out,
and
that's
all
your
argument
is
about.
unknown
speaker
well
it
is
one
third
of
the
jail
time
and
i
am
sure
algebraically
this
is
what
it
comes
out.
unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
ask
you,
not
only
about
i
think
it
is
one
third
of
the
jail
time.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
possibility
of
mootness
here?
unknown
speaker
but
rutherford
is
already
have
his
date
come
and
go,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
is
this
true
as
to
all
name
members
of
the
class?
unknown
speaker
but
aren’t
they
--
don’t
they
have
their
date.
one
of
them
already
has
passed
and
the
other
one
is
coming
up
in
a
month.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
probably
before
this
court
can
decide
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
the
view
on
behalf
of
the
state
is
not
raising
the
question
of
or
not
raising
the
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
is
that
the
answer
to
what
if
all
your
name
parties
are
out?
unknown
speaker
would
this
second
party
now
released
where
he
did
prevail
in
this
case?
the
one
who
has
the
january
23
date.
unknown
speaker
that
his
january
23
is
only
his
parole,
when
he
may
be
considered
for
--
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
were
not
parole
he’d
have
to
wait
till
when?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
difference
between
you
and
the
city
judge
court
you
are
right.
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
opinion
was
that
this
isn’t
the
rehabilitative
function
at
all
but
the
overriding
consideration
is
that
overriding
consideration
in
the
granting
of
good
time
reduction
is
maintenance
of
prison
discipline.
unknown
speaker
well
where
do
you
get
your
reasoning
from?
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
important
--
is
it
important
for
you
to
decide
which
one
is
the
primary
as
long
as
the
district
court
didn’t
deny
that
the
other
reason
was
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well
this
is
what
the
court
said,
“defendants
contend
that
good
time
is
granted
as
an
incentive
to
the
inmates
to
participate
in
these
prison
rehabilitation
programs
and
that,
since
county
jails
are
not
equipped
to
provide
such
services,
there
is
no
basis
for
granting
good
time
for
time
served
therein.
if
it
were
clear
that
the
awarding
of
good
time
was
based
solely
and
exclusively
on
an
evaluation
of
an
inmate's
performance
in
such
programs
so
endemic
to
the
state
prison
system,
the
denial
of
good
time
for
jail
time
might
be
understandable;
however,
this
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case.
rather,
it
seems
that
the
overriding
consideration,”
now
the
district
judge
said
the
“overriding
consideration
in
the
granting
of
good
time
reductions
is
the
maintenance
of
prison
discipline,”
and
you
quarrel
with
that.
unknown
speaker
and
your
answer
to
--
unknown
speaker
--
illuminate
that
the
statute
can't
be
read
that
way.
unknown
speaker
you
also
say
that
the
statute
should
be
upheld
as
an
effort
to
serve
the
non
overriding
purpose
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
say
that
what
the
rule
should
be
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
then
do
some
of
the
clauses
primary
and
secondary
have
some
elements?
unknown
speaker
all
the
people
involved
in
this
case
get
jail
time
for
their
--
unknown
speaker
there
are
sentences,
they
get
credit
for
the
time
they
spend
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
they
just
don’t
get
time
for
that
jail
time.
unknown
speaker
some
of
them
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
colodner.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
at
61(a)
of
the
appendix,
states
that
under
certain
of
circumstances
the
states
does
grant
good
time
credit
for
pre-sentence
detention.
unknown
speaker
could
you
explain
the
circumstances
under
which
that
occurs?
unknown
speaker
just
on
the
max.
unknown
speaker
so
the
good
time
for
pre-sentence
detention
is
allowed
only
with
respect
to
the
maximum
and
only
where
this
ultimate
sentence
is
less
than
a
year.
unknown
speaker
right.
even
though
(inaudible)
the
one
person
who
gets
the
time
would
be
in
the
same
jail
as
one
who
doesn’t
get
the
good
time.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
but
now
let's
take
--
unknown
speaker
neither
of
them.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
they
both
might
be
in
exactly
the
same
jail.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
in
this
context
the
state
purpose
that
you
say
justifies
the
discrimination
against
these
petitioners
doesn’t
exist?
unknown
speaker
but
this
discrimination
it’s
justified,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
say
it's
justified.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
because
the
last
sentence
reads
a
lot
like
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
basically
i
gather
the
state's
position
is
that
however
many
purposes
this
denial
may
serve,
at
least
serves
one
state
purpose
but
on
the
rational
distinction
basis.
unknown
speaker
it
sustains
the
statute
fostering
rehabilitation.
unknown
speaker
whatever
that
maybe
that
at
least
that
one.
unknown
speaker
and
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
it
serves
one.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
let's
make
it
from
alaska.
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
it
is
easier
to
evaluate
what
is
going
on
in
a
local
jail
than
it
is
what's
going
in
a
jail
in
hawaii
or
in
alaska?
unknown
speaker
does
that
holding
in
the
land
in
alaska,
pre-trail
detention
that
i
think
is
as
an
agent
of
the
state
of
new
york,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
or
in
paris,
france.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
no
part
of
the
purpose
at
all?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
when
i
read
your
brother
earlier
from
the
majority
opinion
below,
at
least
accepts,
i
thought
the
ideas
that
there
was
something
overriding
about
maintenance
of
prison
discipline
but
that
didn’t
preclude.
unknown
speaker
as
a
purpose
the
rehabilitation
objective
that
you
probably
spoke
about.
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
your
position
that
the
only
purpose
at
all
served
by
the
statute,
exclusively
the
only
single
purpose
is
the
disciplinary
one.
unknown
speaker
if
a
purpose
is
the
rehabilitation
one,
then
are
you
not
in
some
trouble?
unknown
speaker
if
a
purpose,
not
the
main
purpose,
a
purpose.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
did.
unknown
speaker
suppose
rehabilitation
were
a
subordinate
purpose.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
good
time.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
you
agree
that
the
equal
protection
test
here
is
the
rationality
test
advantage
not
the
compelling
interest
test.
unknown
speaker
are
you
relying
on
perez
and
follette
as
a
construction
of
233
limiting
its
purpose
to
the
disciplinary
objective?
unknown
speaker
well
i
think
what
it
says
is
the
policy
underlying
the
discretionary
grant
of
good
time
reductions
is
clear,
the
attitude
and
conduct
of
prisoners
should
improve
if
they
are
offered
an
incentive
for
good
and
productive
behavior
while
at
the
same
time
the
fact
that
reductions
can
be
withheld
will
inhibit
bad
conduct,
that's
the
language,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
now
may
i
say
again,
is
this
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
an
interpretation
to
what
effect?
unknown
speaker
that
this
was
the
only
intent?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
administrative
remedies?
unknown
speaker
was
it
—
would
there
have
been
any
discretion
in
the
administrators
to
grant
good
time
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
will
put
it
this
way.
does
the
statute
require
the
discrimination
to
which
you’re
objecting?
unknown
speaker
well
does
it
–
it
just
requires
it,
it
is
just
isn't
a
matter
of
an
administrative
application
statute
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
the
administrator
would
have
no
--
the
prison
administration
would
have
no
discretion
whatsoever
that
varied
from
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
your
view
of
the
matter
is,
it
would
require,
would
it
not
that
the
state
institutions
give
credit
as
though
the
man's
behavior
had
been
of
the
highest
order
even
though
that
might
be
contrary
to
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
these
files
are
a
complete
substitute
for
their
own
observation
and
their
own
standards
and
the
state
institution?
unknown
speaker
and
you’d
carry
this
again
within
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
if
you
were
in
a
prison
in
hawaii
or
alaska?
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
undertake
to
carry
it
beyond
the
continental
boundaries
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
of
course
you
might
use
that
probably
for
some
other
reason
as
well.
unknown
speaker
as
a
prosecution
or
defense
witness
for
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
this
argument
doesn't
--
your
submission
as
i
get
it
that
under
subdivision
3
jail
time
is
—
there
is
no
discretion
in
considering
jail
time
at
all
you
said.
unknown
speaker
and
what
you’re
talking
about
is
procedure
that
deals
with
the
only
situation
in
which
it
may
consider
good
time
namely
time
spent
in
the
prison.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
true
of
every
county
in
part
of
the
new
york?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
mr.
colodner,
going
thorough
the
mathematics
of
this
argument,
i
take
it
that
when
it
comes
down
to
difference
between
you
and
your
opposition,
is
one
third
of
the
jail
time,
i
think
mathematically
this
is
where
the
argument
comes
out,
and
that's
all
your
argument
is
about.
unknown
speaker
well
it
is
one
third
of
the
jail
time
and
i
am
sure
algebraically
this
is
what
it
comes
out.
unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
ask
you,
not
only
about
i
think
it
is
one
third
of
the
jail
time.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
possibility
of
mootness
here?
unknown
speaker
but
rutherford
is
already
have
his
date
come
and
go,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
is
this
true
as
to
all
name
members
of
the
class?
unknown
speaker
but
aren’t
they
--
don’t
they
have
their
date.
one
of
them
already
has
passed
and
the
other
one
is
coming
up
in
a
month.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
probably
before
this
court
can
decide
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
the
view
on
behalf
of
the
state
is
not
raising
the
question
of
or
not
raising
the
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
is
that
the
answer
to
what
if
all
your
name
parties
are
out?
unknown
speaker
would
this
second
party
now
released
where
he
did
prevail
in
this
case?
the
one
who
has
the
january
23
date.
unknown
speaker
that
his
january
23
is
only
his
parole,
when
he
may
be
considered
for
--
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
were
not
parole
he’d
have
to
wait
till
when?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
difference
between
you
and
the
city
judge
court
you
are
right.
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
opinion
was
that
this
isn’t
the
rehabilitative
function
at
all
but
the
overriding
consideration
is
that
overriding
consideration
in
the
granting
of
good
time
reduction
is
maintenance
of
prison
discipline.
unknown
speaker
well
where
do
you
get
your
reasoning
from?
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
important
--
is
it
important
for
you
to
decide
which
one
is
the
primary
as
long
as
the
district
court
didn’t
deny
that
the
other
reason
was
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well
this
is
what
the
court
said,
“defendants
contend
that
good
time
is
granted
as
an
incentive
to
the
inmates
to
participate
in
these
prison
rehabilitation
programs
and
that,
since
county
jails
are
not
equipped
to
provide
such
services,
there
is
no
basis
for
granting
good
time
for
time
served
therein.
if
it
were
clear
that
the
awarding
of
good
time
was
based
solely
and
exclusively
on
an
evaluation
of
an
inmate's
performance
in
such
programs
so
endemic
to
the
state
prison
system,
the
denial
of
good
time
for
jail
time
might
be
understandable;
however,
this
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case.
rather,
it
seems
that
the
overriding
consideration,”
now
the
district
judge
said
the
“overriding
consideration
in
the
granting
of
good
time
reductions
is
the
maintenance
of
prison
discipline,”
and
you
quarrel
with
that.
unknown
speaker
and
your
answer
to
--
unknown
speaker
--
illuminate
that
the
statute
can't
be
read
that
way.
unknown
speaker
you
also
say
that
the
statute
should
be
upheld
as
an
effort
to
serve
the
non
overriding
purpose
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
say
that
what
the
rule
should
be
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
then
do
some
of
the
clauses
primary
and
secondary
have
some
elements?
unknown
speaker
all
the
people
involved
in
this
case
get
jail
time
for
their
--
unknown
speaker
there
are
sentences,
they
get
credit
for
the
time
they
spend
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
they
just
don’t
get
time
for
that
jail
time.
unknown
speaker
some
of
them
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
colodner.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
at
61(a)
of
the
appendix,
states
that
under
certain
of
circumstances
the
states
does
grant
good
time
credit
for
pre-sentence
detention.
unknown
speaker
could
you
explain
the
circumstances
under
which
that
occurs?
unknown
speaker
just
on
the
max.
unknown
speaker
so
the
good
time
for
pre-sentence
detention
is
allowed
only
with
respect
to
the
maximum
and
only
where
this
ultimate
sentence
is
less
than
a
year.
unknown
speaker
right.
even
though
(inaudible)
the
one
person
who
gets
the
time
would
be
in
the
same
jail
as
one
who
doesn’t
get
the
good
time.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
but
now
let's
take
--
unknown
speaker
neither
of
them.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
they
both
might
be
in
exactly
the
same
jail.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
in
this
context
the
state
purpose
that
you
say
justifies
the
discrimination
against
these
petitioners
doesn’t
exist?
unknown
speaker
but
this
discrimination
it’s
justified,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
say
it's
justified.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
because
the
last
sentence
reads
a
lot
like
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
basically
i
gather
the
state's
position
is
that
however
many
purposes
this
denial
may
serve,
at
least
serves
one
state
purpose
but
on
the
rational
distinction
basis.
unknown
speaker
it
sustains
the
statute
fostering
rehabilitation.
unknown
speaker
whatever
that
maybe
that
at
least
that
one.
unknown
speaker
and
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
it
serves
one.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
let's
make
it
from
alaska.
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
it
is
easier
to
evaluate
what
is
going
on
in
a
local
jail
than
it
is
what's
going
in
a
jail
in
hawaii
or
in
alaska?
unknown
speaker
does
that
holding
in
the
land
in
alaska,
pre-trail
detention
that
i
think
is
as
an
agent
of
the
state
of
new
york,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
or
in
paris,
france.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
no
part
of
the
purpose
at
all?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
when
i
read
your
brother
earlier
from
the
majority
opinion
below,
at
least
accepts,
i
thought
the
ideas
that
there
was
something
overriding
about
maintenance
of
prison
discipline
but
that
didn’t
preclude.
unknown
speaker
as
a
purpose
the
rehabilitation
objective
that
you
probably
spoke
about.
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
your
position
that
the
only
purpose
at
all
served
by
the
statute,
exclusively
the
only
single
purpose
is
the
disciplinary
one.
unknown
speaker
if
a
purpose
is
the
rehabilitation
one,
then
are
you
not
in
some
trouble?
unknown
speaker
if
a
purpose,
not
the
main
purpose,
a
purpose.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
did.
unknown
speaker
suppose
rehabilitation
were
a
subordinate
purpose.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
good
time.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
you
agree
that
the
equal
protection
test
here
is
the
rationality
test
advantage
not
the
compelling
interest
test.
unknown
speaker
are
you
relying
on
perez
and
follette
as
a
construction
of
233
limiting
its
purpose
to
the
disciplinary
objective?
unknown
speaker
well
i
think
what
it
says
is
the
policy
underlying
the
discretionary
grant
of
good
time
reductions
is
clear,
the
attitude
and
conduct
of
prisoners
should
improve
if
they
are
offered
an
incentive
for
good
and
productive
behavior
while
at
the
same
time
the
fact
that
reductions
can
be
withheld
will
inhibit
bad
conduct,
that's
the
language,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
now
may
i
say
again,
is
this
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
an
interpretation
to
what
effect?
unknown
speaker
that
this
was
the
only
intent?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
administrative
remedies?
unknown
speaker
was
it
—
would
there
have
been
any
discretion
in
the
administrators
to
grant
good
time
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
will
put
it
this
way.
does
the
statute
require
the
discrimination
to
which
you’re
objecting?
unknown
speaker
well
does
it
–
it
just
requires
it,
it
is
just
isn't
a
matter
of
an
administrative
application
statute
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
the
administrator
would
have
no
--
the
prison
administration
would
have
no
discretion
whatsoever
that
varied
from
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
your
view
of
the
matter
is,
it
would
require,
would
it
not
that
the
state
institutions
give
credit
as
though
the
man's
behavior
had
been
of
the
highest
order
even
though
that
might
be
contrary
to
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
these
files
are
a
complete
substitute
for
their
own
observation
and
their
own
standards
and
the
state
institution?
unknown
speaker
and
you’d
carry
this
again
within
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
if
you
were
in
a
prison
in
hawaii
or
alaska?
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
undertake
to
carry
it
beyond
the
continental
boundaries
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
of
course
you
might
use
that
probably
for
some
other
reason
as
well.
unknown
speaker
as
a
prosecution
or
defense
witness
for
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
this
argument
doesn't
--
your
submission
as
i
get
it
that
under
subdivision
3
jail
time
is
—
there
is
no
discretion
in
considering
jail
time
at
all
you
said.
unknown
speaker
and
what
you’re
talking
about
is
procedure
that
deals
with
the
only
situation
in
which
it
may
consider
good
time
namely
time
spent
in
the
prison.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
right?
