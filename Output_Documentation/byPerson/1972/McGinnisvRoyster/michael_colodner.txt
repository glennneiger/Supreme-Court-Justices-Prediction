mr.
michael
colodner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
role
of
federal
courts
in
examining
state
statutes
which
relate
to
the
internal
and
prison
administration
and
what
is
the
scope
of
this
role
within
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
inmates
of
state
prisons.
each
of
them
was
arrested
and
spent
time
in
the
county
jail
prior
to
trial
because
they
could
not
post
bail.
the
appellee,
mr.
royster
had
been
indicted
for
burglary
and
had
spent
11
months
in
jail
in
1965
to
1966.
mr.
rutherford
had
been
indicted
and
convicted
of
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
he
had
spent
eight
months
in
jail
in
1966.
under
provisions
section
230(3)
of
the
correction
law,
he
received
no
credit
for
a
good
behavior
for
this
period
of
pre-trial
incarceration.
he
did
receive
credit
for
the
amount
of
time
on
his
full
sentence
that
he
spent
there
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
earn
good
behavior
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
there
is
no
way
for
the
state
to
evaluate
the
good
behavior
of
a
man
was
is
not
in
their
custody.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
essence
of
this
case
is
that
plaintiffs
say
that
they
wish
to
be
credited
for
this
time
and
the
state
contends
—
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
if
we
were
to
accept
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
judge
we
would
have
to
--
may
have
any
irrebuttable
presumption
to
that
fact.
there
is
no
—
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
true,
but
the
real
problem
with
this
case
presents
is
that
the
concept
of
good
behavior
in
a
county
jail
over
and
apart
from
the
supervisory
problem
and
the
evaluation
problem
is
totally
different
from
the
concept
of
good
behavior
in
a
state
prison
after
someone
has
already
been
convicted
and
is
now
part
of
a
rehabilitation
program.
that
was
in
fact
demandable
for
rehabilitation.
if
someone
is
in
the
county
jail
and
he
is
arrested
is
presumed
innocent,
there
seems
to
be
no
—
certainly
there
is
no
need
for
the
state
or
the
county,
or
any
political
entity
to
institute
a
rehabilitation
program
for
someone
who
is
presumed
innocent
and
is
presumed
to
have
no
need
for
rehabilitation
at
all.
it
is
only
after
he
has
been
convicted
that
not
only
does
the
state
presume
the
need
but
the
individual
inmate.
now
it
is
in
the
proper
attitude
to
presume
that
he
can
be
reformed
and
rehabilitated.
mr.
michael
colodner
your
honor,
there
is
an
orientation
program
when
someone
reaches
the
state
penitentiary
he
goes
to
a
receiving
center.
mr.
michael
colodner
there
is
nothing
in
the
county
jails
at
all.
you
are
detained,
you
cannot
make
bail,
you
are
put
in
the
cell
and
if
by
some
fortuitous
circumstances
the
local
institution
has
some
type
of
recreation
available
or
some
type
of
small
—something
or
other
if
the
inmate
is
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
partake
in
that
while
he
is
waiting
there
for
his
trial.
mr.
michael
colodner
some
counties
have
absolutely
nothing,
some
have
a
little
something,
it
depends
on
--
mr.
michael
colodner
it
is
very
--
very
often
it
is
nothing
more
but
we
have
this
problem,
there
are
inmates
in
county
jails
who
are
serving
misdemeanor
sentences.
county
jail
very
often
outside
the
new
york
city
serves
a
dual
function.
it
detains
people
waiting
for
trial
and
then
also
detains
people
who
have
been
convicted
and
are
serving
sentences
of
one
year
or
less.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
we
do
have
a
system
now
where
we
only
have
sentences
served
on
weekends,
but
i
do
not
—
you
are
really
talking
about
a
minimum
security
type
of
institution
and
with
pretrial
detainees
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
anything
like
that.
this
is
a
post
conviction,
after
an
evaluation
is
made
by
the
state
correctional
people.
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
we
are
arguing
about
at
most
two
or
three
months.
mr.
michael
colodner
about
one
third
of
the
jail
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
okay.
mr.
michael
colodner
there
is
no
possibility
of
mootness
at
all.
there
are—
mr.
michael
colodner
no,
royster
had
his
date
come
and
go.
rutherford
has
his
dates
set
for
january
23rd
1973,
but
this
is
a
class
action
your
honor.
it
affects
the
entire
class
of
prisoners
who
have
been
imprisoned
prior
to
1967
or
have
been
arrested
prior
to
1967.
mr.
michael
colodner
yes.
well,
the
two
name
members
of
the
class
are
also
pre
1967
prisoners.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
true
but
we
have
the
situation
as
this
court
faced
in
dunn
versus
blumstein.
we
have
a
statute
that
is
—
enforcement
in
which
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
escaping
review.
we
do
a
have
a
substantial
number,
we
have
over
--
we
have
2,322
old
law
prisoners
remaining
in
state
prison
all
of
whom
are
affected
by
the
former
correction
law.
of
this
group,
i
would
say
at
least
200-300
are
affected
by
this
very
provision
because
anyone
who
is
arrested
or
had
committed
a
crime
subsequent
between
1963
and
1968
say
and
it
was
a
serious
crime,
it
was
a
murder
or
a
robbery
in
the
first
degree
or
there
were
multiple
offenders,
every
single
one
of
these
people
would
be
affected
by
the
this
law
and
would
not
have
reached
their
minimum
date
at
all.
mr.
michael
colodner
we
can't
raise
the
question
of
mootness
because
we
have
a
class
order
action
against
us
and
if
this
case
were
to
be
moot
we
would
have
our
statute
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
colodner
well
then
our
basic
problem
would
be
as
soon
as
the
name
parties
are
out,
another
name
party
would
come
right
in.
i
myself
have
the
case
pending
in
the
district
court
awaiting
disposition
of
this
case
involving
someone
who
comes
right
under
this
statute.
mr.
michael
colodner
he
would
not
necessarily
be
released
that
just
means
that
he
would
meet
his
parole
board
at
that
particular
point.
the
basic
problem
that
really
happened
with
this
case
is
that
the
district
court
misunderstood
the
concept
of
--
mr.
michael
colodner
only
when
when
he
maybe
considered
for
parole.
mr.
michael
colodner
he
have
to
wait
till
the
maximum
of
his
sentence
or
depending
on
how
much
good
tome
he
would
earn
on
that
sentence.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
was
the
only
consequence
of
good
time
on
the
minimum
sentence
which
is
the
only
thing
at
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
good
time
on
the
maximum
sentence
and
here
we
have
a
very
interesting
distinction
and
this
is
where
the
district
court
really
missed
the
conception.
good
time
on
the
maximum
basically
serves
more
of
a
custodial
function.
here
it
is
really
where
you
are
trying
to
encourage
good
behavior.
it's
essentially
a
negative
concept,
don’t
break
the
rules
and
we
will
reward
you
with
the
certain
amount
of
good
time.
that
is
on
the
maximum.
good
time
on
the
minimum
doesn’t
serve
that
function,
it's
more
of
a
rehabilitator
function.
it’s
saying,
you
perform
well,
you
show
positive
attitude
and
we
will
give
you
chance
to
be
released
very,
very
early,
and
it’s
the
balance
of
these
concepts
which
is
really
a
issue
here
and
we
are
dealing
with
the
minimum
sentence
and
this
is
the
rehabilitative
concept.
now
i
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief
historically,
there
has
always
been
a
distinction
between
what
was
called
commutation
between
conduct
and
compensation
which
was
for
positive
performance
and
the
whole
history
of
the
new
york
correctional
scheme
tries
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
two
until
finally
in
1931
the
two
were
consolidated
and
in
fact
at
one
point
they
used
to
actually
pay
people
for
compensation,
and
they
finally
reduced
sentence
for
compensation.
now,
specifically
in
the
statute,
there
is
a
reduction
in
sentence
for
both
good
conduct
and
for
the
efficient
and
willing
performance
of
duties
assigned.
so
good
time
is
certainly
more
than
a
question
if
whether
you
are
bad
or
good
as
the
district
court
has
stated.
it
is
not
question
really
of
saying
whether
being
bad
or
good
is
the
primary
function
and
rehabilitation
is
the
secondary
function,
peripheral
functions
under
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
rehabilitation
is
an
existence
in
this
--
mr.
michael
colodner
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
well
your
honor,
we
don’t
know
to
what
extent
rehabilitation
is
really
the
role
of
the
prison
or
the
role
of
society.
we
have
set
up
a
system
to
enable
the
state
correctional
authorities
to
evaluate
an
individual's
particular
performance
in
a
particular
program.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
department,
there
are
two
means
of
evaluation.
first,
there’s
a
department
of
correction,
which
evaluates
him
under
very,
very
strict
standards.
mr.
michael
colodner
well
first
of
all
there
is
a
time
allowance
--
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
not
true?
that
is
not
true.
mr.
michael
colodner
for
evaluation?
mr.
michael
colodner
for
rehabilitation,
you
have
--
mr.
michael
colodner
rehabilitation
is
a
continuing
concept.
you
have
your
industry
setup,
you
have
work
training,
you
have
a
school
program
set,
you
have
an
educational
curriculum.
mr.
michael
colodner
a
great
many
industries
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
textiles
factories,
we
have
barber
shop
there.
we
teach
trades,
we
manufacture
a
lot
of
goods.
i
know
greenhaven
state
prison
has
a
textile
factory.
i
am
not
familiar
with
anything
more
than
that.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
situation
in
(inaudible)
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
true.
but
the
fact,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
rehabilitation
may
not
be
successful
and
the
new
york
state
department
of
correction
is
not
going
to
stand
before
this
court
and
say
that
we
are
successfully
rehabilitating
every
prisoner
comes
there.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
state
cannot
try
to
set
forth
a
statutory
scheme
and
attempt
to
rehabilitate
and
if
the
scheme
is
not
successful
to
try
a
new
scheme.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
he
is
losing
this
because
we
have
a
very
–
not
an
elaborate
but
we
have
a
system
of
evaluation
of
the
prisoners
performance
in
a
state
correctional
program,
and
this
is
very
important—
mr.
michael
colodner
if
there
were
no
rehabilitation
program
at
all,
i
think
it
would
still
be
the
same.
it
would
be
the
same
for
other
reasons,
because
you
have
a
man
who
–
it
can
only
be
–
your
honor
we
are
releasing
him
now
at
the
minimum
date.
the
sentencing
judge
has
set
a
date
all
the
way
at
the
lowest
possible
date
this
man
can
get
out
and
the
correctional
scheme
set
under
this
law
is
that
they
are
going
to
let
him
out
two
thirds
of
that
date,
which
means
even
lower
than
the
lowest.
they
have
to
evaluate
the
man
and
it's
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
state
to
set
up
a
system
that
says,
we
are
not
going
to
consider
time
spent
in
institution
where
we
had
no
chance
of
evaluating
him.
now
maybe
this
is
not
the
perfect
system
but
equal
protection
does
not
require
that
we
have
the
perfect
system
and
more
of
the
basic
problems
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
is
that
it
said,
now
wait
a
second
state,
i
do
not
think
you
are
putting
in
the
best
system,
and
so
the
district
court,
the
majority
below
said,
“let
me
show
how
to
do
it”
and
it
showed
how
we
can
basically
have
a
better
evaluation
by
the
parole
board
in
the
state
prison
how
we
could
transfers
the
records
from
the
county
jails
and
we
can
set
the
system
that
way.
that
might
be
true
but
the
constitution
doesn’t
require
that
the
state
do
this.
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
about
the
statutory
scheme
which
is
set
up
right
now.
state
prisons
and
county
jails
are
completely
different.
county
jails
for
the
first
part
offer
nothing,
they
are
purely
detention
centers.
there
is
certainly
not
a
fact
in
this
record
to
show
that
they
offer
anything,
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
state
to
set
up
a
system
of
evaluation
or
a
rehabilitative
program
in
an
institution
where
people
are
presumed
innocent
and
could
not
be
subject
to
but
in
fact
if
they
were
compelled
to
participate
we
have
a
thirteenth
amendment
problem
and
also
we
have
to
sense
this
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
the
county
jail
is
so
short
comparatively
that
if
you
are
going
to
set
up
any
sort
of
a
meaningful
program
or
even
have
any
meaningful
evaluation,
it
would
not
be
worthwhile
to
look
upon
two
or
three
months
in
an
institution
where
nothing
can
really
be
accomplished
within
that
space.
now
unless
you
remember
that
the
evaluation
by
the
correction
department,
it
is
dual
evaluation
here,
first
the
correction
department
certifies
to
the
parole
board
that
this
man
is
now
ready
to
be
considered
for
release
and
this
is
certainly
something
the
legislature
can
do.
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
are
argued
strongly
that
the
parole
board
has
a
lot
of
discretion,
so
it
doesn’t
really
matter,
but
a
state
legislature
certainly
has
the
power
and
the
right
to
draw
line
and
set
up
to
a
certain
point,
parole
board,
you
are
not
allowed
to
make
this
evaluation
because
we
have
made
a
legislative
determination
that
a
man
has
to
spend
a
particular
amount
of
time
in
a
particular
program.
and
this
evaluation
and
i
left
out
section
214(4),
the
correction
law,
is
a
very
serious
one
because
it
involves
a
complete
re-determination
of
the
inmate's
attitude,
of
his
progress
and
this
is
made
by
officials,
the
director
of
prison
industries,
the
physician,
the
warden,
the
director
of
education.
this
is
serious
evaluation
and
it
cannot
be
done
by
considering
time
in
a
county
jail.
now
what
essentially
happened
here
was
that
the
district
court
ignored
everything,
ignored
--
in
fact
the
district
court
acknowledged
that
there
are
certainly
differences
and
yes
there
were
different
goals
and
yes,
you
really
can’t
rehabilitate
people
in
county
jails,
but
it
ruled
out
the
primary
basis
for
this
statute
was
whether
someone
was
good
or
bad,
and
that
is
it
and
this
totally
ignored
the
differences
that
i
have
stated
that
the
primary
basis
for
the
release
on
good
time
on
the
minimum
sentence
is
the
rehabilitative
function,
not
a
custodial
function.
and
then
the
district
court
said,
well,
assuming
that
there
are
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
know
where
the
district
court
gets
that
reasoning
from
because
--
mr.
michael
colodner
from
the
very
language
of
section
233
of
the
correction
law,
good
time
is
awarded
for
good
conduct
and
for
the
willing
and
efficient
performance
and
duties
that
are
assigned.
there
are
two
concepts
and
they
balance.
mr.
michael
colodner
absolutely
not.
in
fact
the
district
court
acknowledged
it
and
said,
if
it
was
sole
and
exclusive
reason,
state
i
would
agree
with
you,
but
the
district
court
decided
for
my
reading
of
the
opinion
that
since
it
wasn’t
the
sole
and
exclusive
reason,
we
only
go
by
what
the
primary
reason
is,
and
this
is
totally
in
conflict
with
the
decisions
on
this
court
in
equal
protection.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
certainly
do
quarrel
with
it,
first
of
all
--
mr.
michael
colodner
first
of
all
--
mr.
michael
colodner
the
statute
can’t
be
that
away.
we
put
in
affidavits
to
the
effect
this
wasn't
the
purpose
at
all,
there
was
much
more
purpose
then
the
award
for
custodial
behavior.
none
of
--
mr.
michael
colodner
a
statute
should
be
upheld
to
serve
whatever
purpose
it
is
passed
for.
we
can't
make
considerations
as
to
whether
something
is
primary
or
secondary,
if
that
were
the
case
any
judge
can
look
and
decide
to
see
what
or
any
clerk
can
look
and
decide
to
see
which
one
he
liked
best
and
then
pick
it
out
and
then
try
to
gear
and
restructure
the
state
system
according
to
what
he
thought
was
the
primary
basis
or
the
secondary
basis
and
in
fact
as
soon—
mr.
michael
colodner
definitely
if—
mr.
michael
colodner
whatever
all
the
clauses
there
are
i
don’t
know
but
certainly
not
the
equal
protection
clause.
for
instance,
let's
assume
that
good
behavior
is
just
the
primary
basis
here
and
that
evaluation
is
a
secondary
basis,
why
couldn't
the
legislature
then
repass
the
same
statute
and
put
a
little
amendment
at
the
bottom
and
say
we
think
that
rehabilitation
is
the
primary
basis.
this
is
exactly
what
this
court
dealt
within
palmer
versus
thompson
and
so
we
don’t
look
to
the
motive
of
the
legislation.
we
look
to
see
whether
there
is
any
state
of
facts
that
can
consider
–
just
to
justify
the
classification.
if
we
find
the
state
of
facts
that
is
the
end
of
the
judicial
rule.
mr.
michael
colodner
pardon.
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
colodner
under
this
particular
scheme—
mr.
michael
colodner
oh,
how
long
—
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
we
have
had
a
developing
program
since
the
turn
of
the
century.
mr.
michael
colodner
yes.
in
this
particular
field
of
person
administration,
the
standard
which
has
to
be
used
keeping
the
rational
basis
standard
because
we
are
out
dealing
with
what
is
a
very
sensitive
area,
we
have
to
balance
both
the
needs
of
the
prison
in
so
far
as
the
needs
of
the
inmates
are
concerned
and
the
needs
of
the
prison
structure
concern
versus
the
needs
of
the
society
which
is
paramount
to
whether
somebody
is
going
to
be
released
prior
to
the
lowest
part
of
his
sentence.
there
are
no
known
solutions
to
this
problem
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
points
out
there
maybe
problems
as
to
whether
rehabilitation
succeeds
or
not
and
penalty
is
a
very
open
science,
for
this
is
the
very
area
because
of
the
openness
of
this
field
where
the
state
has
to
have
broad
discussion,
just
like
this
court
stated
in
jefferson
against
hackney
in
the
welfare
area
which
is
also
a
very
open
question
in
terms
of
what
is
the
proper
solution.
the
state
cannot
be
put
in
the
constitutional
straitjacket
in
dealing
with
how
we
are
going
to
going
to
set
up
a
very
complex
system
of
awarding
good
time.
as
it
is
illustrated
by
the
history
of
the
statute
all
through
the
--
since
the
turn
of
the
century
we
have
been
constantly
changing
out
statute,
sometimes
putting
good
time
on
the
minimum,
sometimes
on
the
maximum,
sometimes
on
indeterminate
terms
sometimes
on
definite
terms,
trying
to
strike
a
balance
and
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
do
this.
mr.
michael
colodner
everyone
gets
jail
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
good
time
is
granted
on
the
maximum
sentence.
mr.
michael
colodner
no,
there
are
–
on
the
maximum
sentence,
because
as
i
pointed
out
the
difference
between
the
custodial
components
on
the
maximum,
the
rehabilitative
component
on
the
minimum
makes
it
a
more
effective
disciplinary
device
on
the
maximum.
good
time
is
also
rewarded
for
jail
time
on
penitentiary
sentences,
those
are
sentences
for
misdemeanors
of
less
than
one
year.
here
again,
the
evaluation
is
not
that
sensitive.
we
are
dealing
with
short
sentences
with
much
less
serious
crimes
and
with
a
practical
problem
that
the
county
jails
are
overcrowded
and
they
want
a
faster
turn
over.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
right.
it
is
under
the
old
law.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
think
if
there
is
a
comparable
situation
there,
i
don’t
know
whether
you
can
--
yes,
that
is
true.
if
someone
--
now
if
we’re
comparing
someone
with
both
people
who
are
convicted
of
felonies,
there
is
no
comparable
situation,
neither
of
them
get
good
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
neither
of
them.
but
if
you
are
someone
who
is
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
as
opposed
to
someone
who
is
–
let's
say
both
indicted
for
both.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
misdemeanant
would
get
credit
for
good
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
exactly
the
same
jail
but
it
makes
not
difference
in
those
terms
because
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
misdemeanant,
the
state
legislature
would
set
up
a
system
which
is
purely
custodial
and
it's
a
very
short
sentence
and
they
are
willing
to
give
him
as
much
time
as
they
wish
to
give
him
without
trying
to
set
up
a
program
for
rehabilitation.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
right.
there
is
no
discrimination
against
these
petitioners
in
terms
of
the
goals
of
this
particular
statutory
scheme.
mr.
michael
colodner
definitely
justified.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
say
so
and
i
think
of
the
record
bears
me
up
and
i
think
that
the
majority
of
the
district
courts
didn’t
—
just
didn’t
like
the
statute
because
the
majority
of
the
district
courts
basically
acted
as
a
super
legislature
and
showed
the
state
of
—
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
know
if
judge
hayes
used
that
word,
i
use
that
word
in
my
brief.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
district
court
did.
it
incorrectly
analyzed
the
statute,
it
totally
ignored
every
justification
we
put
forth
by
saying
that,
but
would
not
consider
these
justification
because
they
want
solely
and
exclusively.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
suggest
it
serves
more
than
one
but
that
—
mr.
michael
colodner
at
least
one.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
our
position.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
colodner
your
honor,
i
have
two
minutes
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i’d
like
to
answer
two
of
the
contentions
raised
by
the
attorney
for
the
appellees.
first
of
all
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
clarity
in
the
institution
between
people
who
are
once
sent
to
state
prison
and
then
for
various
reasons
have
to
be
sent
to
institutions
and
one
of
the
examples
raised
is
someone
who
has
to
return
to
the
county
jail
because
he
is
contesting
a
proposed
conviction
proceeding
while
the
court
knows
the
validity
of
his
sentence
and
he
might
remain
in
this
county
jail
for
two
days
or
a
few
weeks
depending
on
how
long
it
takes.
now,
certainly
we
are
not
going
to
say
that
these
people
are
not
to
be
awarded
good
time
because
in
the
course
of
their
program
in
the
state
prison
they
have
to
leave
for
a
short
instance.
in
fact,
if
we
did
deprive
these
people
of
good
time,
we
would
be
raising
serious
constitutional
problems
about
denial
of
access
to
the
courts.
if
a
inmate
in
state
prison
knows
that
if
he
wants
to
utilize
a
state
post-conviction
remedy
but
he
would
also
be
losing
good
time
he
might
be
deterred
in
utilizing
that
remedy.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
colodner
they
are
all
possibilities.
the
system
doesn't
work
on
absolute
perfection,
what
if
someone
was
sick
for
two
weeks.
does
he
get
good
time?
i
would
like
to
add
one
more
thing
and
before
lunch,
the
argument
was
made
that
the
time
allowance
committee
operates
solely
as
the
punitive
entity
it
does
not
at
all.
the
time
allowance
committee
is
what
gives
credit
for
good
time.
this
is
an
evaluation
that
take
takes
into
account
the
entire
institutional
experience
of
the
inmate,
not
whether
he’s
been
good
or
bad.
in
fact
in
the
superintendent's
proceedings
that
was
mentioned
previously
which
is
purely
a
punitive
action
the
time
allowance
committee
can
re-credit
any
time
subtracted
by
the
superintendent's
proceeding
when
the
date—
mr.
michael
colodner
no,
that’s—
mr.
michael
colodner
that's
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
but
my
point
i
am
making
on
this
argument
is
to
show
that
the
time
spent
in
prison
is
evaluated
from
a
rehabilitative
standpoint,
not
necessarily
only
from
a
punitive
standpoint.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
colodner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
role
of
federal
courts
in
examining
state
statutes
which
relate
to
the
internal
and
prison
administration
and
what
is
the
scope
of
this
role
within
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
inmates
of
state
prisons.
each
of
them
was
arrested
and
spent
time
in
the
county
jail
prior
to
trial
because
they
could
not
post
bail.
the
appellee,
mr.
royster
had
been
indicted
for
burglary
and
had
spent
11
months
in
jail
in
1965
to
1966.
mr.
rutherford
had
been
indicted
and
convicted
of
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
he
had
spent
eight
months
in
jail
in
1966.
under
provisions
section
230(3)
of
the
correction
law,
he
received
no
credit
for
a
good
behavior
for
this
period
of
pre-trial
incarceration.
he
did
receive
credit
for
the
amount
of
time
on
his
full
sentence
that
he
spent
there
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
earn
good
behavior
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
there
is
no
way
for
the
state
to
evaluate
the
good
behavior
of
a
man
was
is
not
in
their
custody.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
essence
of
this
case
is
that
plaintiffs
say
that
they
wish
to
be
credited
for
this
time
and
the
state
contends
—
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
if
we
were
to
accept
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
judge
we
would
have
to
--
may
have
any
irrebuttable
presumption
to
that
fact.
there
is
no
—
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
true,
but
the
real
problem
with
this
case
presents
is
that
the
concept
of
good
behavior
in
a
county
jail
over
and
apart
from
the
supervisory
problem
and
the
evaluation
problem
is
totally
different
from
the
concept
of
good
behavior
in
a
state
prison
after
someone
has
already
been
convicted
and
is
now
part
of
a
rehabilitation
program.
that
was
in
fact
demandable
for
rehabilitation.
if
someone
is
in
the
county
jail
and
he
is
arrested
is
presumed
innocent,
there
seems
to
be
no
—
certainly
there
is
no
need
for
the
state
or
the
county,
or
any
political
entity
to
institute
a
rehabilitation
program
for
someone
who
is
presumed
innocent
and
is
presumed
to
have
no
need
for
rehabilitation
at
all.
it
is
only
after
he
has
been
convicted
that
not
only
does
the
state
presume
the
need
but
the
individual
inmate.
now
it
is
in
the
proper
attitude
to
presume
that
he
can
be
reformed
and
rehabilitated.
mr.
michael
colodner
your
honor,
there
is
an
orientation
program
when
someone
reaches
the
state
penitentiary
he
goes
to
a
receiving
center.
mr.
michael
colodner
there
is
nothing
in
the
county
jails
at
all.
you
are
detained,
you
cannot
make
bail,
you
are
put
in
the
cell
and
if
by
some
fortuitous
circumstances
the
local
institution
has
some
type
of
recreation
available
or
some
type
of
small
—something
or
other
if
the
inmate
is
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
partake
in
that
while
he
is
waiting
there
for
his
trial.
mr.
michael
colodner
some
counties
have
absolutely
nothing,
some
have
a
little
something,
it
depends
on
--
mr.
michael
colodner
it
is
very
--
very
often
it
is
nothing
more
but
we
have
this
problem,
there
are
inmates
in
county
jails
who
are
serving
misdemeanor
sentences.
county
jail
very
often
outside
the
new
york
city
serves
a
dual
function.
it
detains
people
waiting
for
trial
and
then
also
detains
people
who
have
been
convicted
and
are
serving
sentences
of
one
year
or
less.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
we
do
have
a
system
now
where
we
only
have
sentences
served
on
weekends,
but
i
do
not
—
you
are
really
talking
about
a
minimum
security
type
of
institution
and
with
pretrial
detainees
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
anything
like
that.
this
is
a
post
conviction,
after
an
evaluation
is
made
by
the
state
correctional
people.
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
we
are
arguing
about
at
most
two
or
three
months.
mr.
michael
colodner
about
one
third
of
the
jail
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
okay.
mr.
michael
colodner
there
is
no
possibility
of
mootness
at
all.
there
are—
mr.
michael
colodner
no,
royster
had
his
date
come
and
go.
rutherford
has
his
dates
set
for
january
23rd
1973,
but
this
is
a
class
action
your
honor.
it
affects
the
entire
class
of
prisoners
who
have
been
imprisoned
prior
to
1967
or
have
been
arrested
prior
to
1967.
mr.
michael
colodner
yes.
well,
the
two
name
members
of
the
class
are
also
pre
1967
prisoners.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
true
but
we
have
the
situation
as
this
court
faced
in
dunn
versus
blumstein.
we
have
a
statute
that
is
—
enforcement
in
which
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
escaping
review.
we
do
a
have
a
substantial
number,
we
have
over
--
we
have
2,322
old
law
prisoners
remaining
in
state
prison
all
of
whom
are
affected
by
the
former
correction
law.
of
this
group,
i
would
say
at
least
200-300
are
affected
by
this
very
provision
because
anyone
who
is
arrested
or
had
committed
a
crime
subsequent
between
1963
and
1968
say
and
it
was
a
serious
crime,
it
was
a
murder
or
a
robbery
in
the
first
degree
or
there
were
multiple
offenders,
every
single
one
of
these
people
would
be
affected
by
the
this
law
and
would
not
have
reached
their
minimum
date
at
all.
mr.
michael
colodner
we
can't
raise
the
question
of
mootness
because
we
have
a
class
order
action
against
us
and
if
this
case
were
to
be
moot
we
would
have
our
statute
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
colodner
well
then
our
basic
problem
would
be
as
soon
as
the
name
parties
are
out,
another
name
party
would
come
right
in.
i
myself
have
the
case
pending
in
the
district
court
awaiting
disposition
of
this
case
involving
someone
who
comes
right
under
this
statute.
mr.
michael
colodner
he
would
not
necessarily
be
released
that
just
means
that
he
would
meet
his
parole
board
at
that
particular
point.
the
basic
problem
that
really
happened
with
this
case
is
that
the
district
court
misunderstood
the
concept
of
--
mr.
michael
colodner
only
when
when
he
maybe
considered
for
parole.
mr.
michael
colodner
he
have
to
wait
till
the
maximum
of
his
sentence
or
depending
on
how
much
good
tome
he
would
earn
on
that
sentence.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
was
the
only
consequence
of
good
time
on
the
minimum
sentence
which
is
the
only
thing
at
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
good
time
on
the
maximum
sentence
and
here
we
have
a
very
interesting
distinction
and
this
is
where
the
district
court
really
missed
the
conception.
good
time
on
the
maximum
basically
serves
more
of
a
custodial
function.
here
it
is
really
where
you
are
trying
to
encourage
good
behavior.
it's
essentially
a
negative
concept,
don’t
break
the
rules
and
we
will
reward
you
with
the
certain
amount
of
good
time.
that
is
on
the
maximum.
good
time
on
the
minimum
doesn’t
serve
that
function,
it's
more
of
a
rehabilitator
function.
it’s
saying,
you
perform
well,
you
show
positive
attitude
and
we
will
give
you
chance
to
be
released
very,
very
early,
and
it’s
the
balance
of
these
concepts
which
is
really
a
issue
here
and
we
are
dealing
with
the
minimum
sentence
and
this
is
the
rehabilitative
concept.
now
i
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief
historically,
there
has
always
been
a
distinction
between
what
was
called
commutation
between
conduct
and
compensation
which
was
for
positive
performance
and
the
whole
history
of
the
new
york
correctional
scheme
tries
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
two
until
finally
in
1931
the
two
were
consolidated
and
in
fact
at
one
point
they
used
to
actually
pay
people
for
compensation,
and
they
finally
reduced
sentence
for
compensation.
now,
specifically
in
the
statute,
there
is
a
reduction
in
sentence
for
both
good
conduct
and
for
the
efficient
and
willing
performance
of
duties
assigned.
so
good
time
is
certainly
more
than
a
question
if
whether
you
are
bad
or
good
as
the
district
court
has
stated.
it
is
not
question
really
of
saying
whether
being
bad
or
good
is
the
primary
function
and
rehabilitation
is
the
secondary
function,
peripheral
functions
under
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
rehabilitation
is
an
existence
in
this
--
mr.
michael
colodner
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
well
your
honor,
we
don’t
know
to
what
extent
rehabilitation
is
really
the
role
of
the
prison
or
the
role
of
society.
we
have
set
up
a
system
to
enable
the
state
correctional
authorities
to
evaluate
an
individual's
particular
performance
in
a
particular
program.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
department,
there
are
two
means
of
evaluation.
first,
there’s
a
department
of
correction,
which
evaluates
him
under
very,
very
strict
standards.
mr.
michael
colodner
well
first
of
all
there
is
a
time
allowance
--
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
not
true?
that
is
not
true.
mr.
michael
colodner
for
evaluation?
mr.
michael
colodner
for
rehabilitation,
you
have
--
mr.
michael
colodner
rehabilitation
is
a
continuing
concept.
you
have
your
industry
setup,
you
have
work
training,
you
have
a
school
program
set,
you
have
an
educational
curriculum.
mr.
michael
colodner
a
great
many
industries
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
textiles
factories,
we
have
barber
shop
there.
we
teach
trades,
we
manufacture
a
lot
of
goods.
i
know
greenhaven
state
prison
has
a
textile
factory.
i
am
not
familiar
with
anything
more
than
that.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
situation
in
(inaudible)
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
true.
but
the
fact,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
rehabilitation
may
not
be
successful
and
the
new
york
state
department
of
correction
is
not
going
to
stand
before
this
court
and
say
that
we
are
successfully
rehabilitating
every
prisoner
comes
there.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
state
cannot
try
to
set
forth
a
statutory
scheme
and
attempt
to
rehabilitate
and
if
the
scheme
is
not
successful
to
try
a
new
scheme.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
he
is
losing
this
because
we
have
a
very
–
not
an
elaborate
but
we
have
a
system
of
evaluation
of
the
prisoners
performance
in
a
state
correctional
program,
and
this
is
very
important—
mr.
michael
colodner
if
there
were
no
rehabilitation
program
at
all,
i
think
it
would
still
be
the
same.
it
would
be
the
same
for
other
reasons,
because
you
have
a
man
who
–
it
can
only
be
–
your
honor
we
are
releasing
him
now
at
the
minimum
date.
the
sentencing
judge
has
set
a
date
all
the
way
at
the
lowest
possible
date
this
man
can
get
out
and
the
correctional
scheme
set
under
this
law
is
that
they
are
going
to
let
him
out
two
thirds
of
that
date,
which
means
even
lower
than
the
lowest.
they
have
to
evaluate
the
man
and
it's
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
state
to
set
up
a
system
that
says,
we
are
not
going
to
consider
time
spent
in
institution
where
we
had
no
chance
of
evaluating
him.
now
maybe
this
is
not
the
perfect
system
but
equal
protection
does
not
require
that
we
have
the
perfect
system
and
more
of
the
basic
problems
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
is
that
it
said,
now
wait
a
second
state,
i
do
not
think
you
are
putting
in
the
best
system,
and
so
the
district
court,
the
majority
below
said,
“let
me
show
how
to
do
it”
and
it
showed
how
we
can
basically
have
a
better
evaluation
by
the
parole
board
in
the
state
prison
how
we
could
transfers
the
records
from
the
county
jails
and
we
can
set
the
system
that
way.
that
might
be
true
but
the
constitution
doesn’t
require
that
the
state
do
this.
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
about
the
statutory
scheme
which
is
set
up
right
now.
state
prisons
and
county
jails
are
completely
different.
county
jails
for
the
first
part
offer
nothing,
they
are
purely
detention
centers.
there
is
certainly
not
a
fact
in
this
record
to
show
that
they
offer
anything,
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
state
to
set
up
a
system
of
evaluation
or
a
rehabilitative
program
in
an
institution
where
people
are
presumed
innocent
and
could
not
be
subject
to
but
in
fact
if
they
were
compelled
to
participate
we
have
a
thirteenth
amendment
problem
and
also
we
have
to
sense
this
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
the
county
jail
is
so
short
comparatively
that
if
you
are
going
to
set
up
any
sort
of
a
meaningful
program
or
even
have
any
meaningful
evaluation,
it
would
not
be
worthwhile
to
look
upon
two
or
three
months
in
an
institution
where
nothing
can
really
be
accomplished
within
that
space.
now
unless
you
remember
that
the
evaluation
by
the
correction
department,
it
is
dual
evaluation
here,
first
the
correction
department
certifies
to
the
parole
board
that
this
man
is
now
ready
to
be
considered
for
release
and
this
is
certainly
something
the
legislature
can
do.
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
are
argued
strongly
that
the
parole
board
has
a
lot
of
discretion,
so
it
doesn’t
really
matter,
but
a
state
legislature
certainly
has
the
power
and
the
right
to
draw
line
and
set
up
to
a
certain
point,
parole
board,
you
are
not
allowed
to
make
this
evaluation
because
we
have
made
a
legislative
determination
that
a
man
has
to
spend
a
particular
amount
of
time
in
a
particular
program.
and
this
evaluation
and
i
left
out
section
214(4),
the
correction
law,
is
a
very
serious
one
because
it
involves
a
complete
re-determination
of
the
inmate's
attitude,
of
his
progress
and
this
is
made
by
officials,
the
director
of
prison
industries,
the
physician,
the
warden,
the
director
of
education.
this
is
serious
evaluation
and
it
cannot
be
done
by
considering
time
in
a
county
jail.
now
what
essentially
happened
here
was
that
the
district
court
ignored
everything,
ignored
--
in
fact
the
district
court
acknowledged
that
there
are
certainly
differences
and
yes
there
were
different
goals
and
yes,
you
really
can’t
rehabilitate
people
in
county
jails,
but
it
ruled
out
the
primary
basis
for
this
statute
was
whether
someone
was
good
or
bad,
and
that
is
it
and
this
totally
ignored
the
differences
that
i
have
stated
that
the
primary
basis
for
the
release
on
good
time
on
the
minimum
sentence
is
the
rehabilitative
function,
not
a
custodial
function.
and
then
the
district
court
said,
well,
assuming
that
there
are
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
know
where
the
district
court
gets
that
reasoning
from
because
--
mr.
michael
colodner
from
the
very
language
of
section
233
of
the
correction
law,
good
time
is
awarded
for
good
conduct
and
for
the
willing
and
efficient
performance
and
duties
that
are
assigned.
there
are
two
concepts
and
they
balance.
mr.
michael
colodner
absolutely
not.
in
fact
the
district
court
acknowledged
it
and
said,
if
it
was
sole
and
exclusive
reason,
state
i
would
agree
with
you,
but
the
district
court
decided
for
my
reading
of
the
opinion
that
since
it
wasn’t
the
sole
and
exclusive
reason,
we
only
go
by
what
the
primary
reason
is,
and
this
is
totally
in
conflict
with
the
decisions
on
this
court
in
equal
protection.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
certainly
do
quarrel
with
it,
first
of
all
--
mr.
michael
colodner
first
of
all
--
mr.
michael
colodner
the
statute
can’t
be
that
away.
we
put
in
affidavits
to
the
effect
this
wasn't
the
purpose
at
all,
there
was
much
more
purpose
then
the
award
for
custodial
behavior.
none
of
--
mr.
michael
colodner
a
statute
should
be
upheld
to
serve
whatever
purpose
it
is
passed
for.
we
can't
make
considerations
as
to
whether
something
is
primary
or
secondary,
if
that
were
the
case
any
judge
can
look
and
decide
to
see
what
or
any
clerk
can
look
and
decide
to
see
which
one
he
liked
best
and
then
pick
it
out
and
then
try
to
gear
and
restructure
the
state
system
according
to
what
he
thought
was
the
primary
basis
or
the
secondary
basis
and
in
fact
as
soon—
mr.
michael
colodner
definitely
if—
mr.
michael
colodner
whatever
all
the
clauses
there
are
i
don’t
know
but
certainly
not
the
equal
protection
clause.
for
instance,
let's
assume
that
good
behavior
is
just
the
primary
basis
here
and
that
evaluation
is
a
secondary
basis,
why
couldn't
the
legislature
then
repass
the
same
statute
and
put
a
little
amendment
at
the
bottom
and
say
we
think
that
rehabilitation
is
the
primary
basis.
this
is
exactly
what
this
court
dealt
within
palmer
versus
thompson
and
so
we
don’t
look
to
the
motive
of
the
legislation.
we
look
to
see
whether
there
is
any
state
of
facts
that
can
consider
–
just
to
justify
the
classification.
if
we
find
the
state
of
facts
that
is
the
end
of
the
judicial
rule.
mr.
michael
colodner
pardon.
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
colodner
under
this
particular
scheme—
mr.
michael
colodner
oh,
how
long
—
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
we
have
had
a
developing
program
since
the
turn
of
the
century.
mr.
michael
colodner
yes.
in
this
particular
field
of
person
administration,
the
standard
which
has
to
be
used
keeping
the
rational
basis
standard
because
we
are
out
dealing
with
what
is
a
very
sensitive
area,
we
have
to
balance
both
the
needs
of
the
prison
in
so
far
as
the
needs
of
the
inmates
are
concerned
and
the
needs
of
the
prison
structure
concern
versus
the
needs
of
the
society
which
is
paramount
to
whether
somebody
is
going
to
be
released
prior
to
the
lowest
part
of
his
sentence.
there
are
no
known
solutions
to
this
problem
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
points
out
there
maybe
problems
as
to
whether
rehabilitation
succeeds
or
not
and
penalty
is
a
very
open
science,
for
this
is
the
very
area
because
of
the
openness
of
this
field
where
the
state
has
to
have
broad
discussion,
just
like
this
court
stated
in
jefferson
against
hackney
in
the
welfare
area
which
is
also
a
very
open
question
in
terms
of
what
is
the
proper
solution.
the
state
cannot
be
put
in
the
constitutional
straitjacket
in
dealing
with
how
we
are
going
to
going
to
set
up
a
very
complex
system
of
awarding
good
time.
as
it
is
illustrated
by
the
history
of
the
statute
all
through
the
--
since
the
turn
of
the
century
we
have
been
constantly
changing
out
statute,
sometimes
putting
good
time
on
the
minimum,
sometimes
on
the
maximum,
sometimes
on
indeterminate
terms
sometimes
on
definite
terms,
trying
to
strike
a
balance
and
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
do
this.
mr.
michael
colodner
everyone
gets
jail
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
good
time
is
granted
on
the
maximum
sentence.
mr.
michael
colodner
no,
there
are
–
on
the
maximum
sentence,
because
as
i
pointed
out
the
difference
between
the
custodial
components
on
the
maximum,
the
rehabilitative
component
on
the
minimum
makes
it
a
more
effective
disciplinary
device
on
the
maximum.
good
time
is
also
rewarded
for
jail
time
on
penitentiary
sentences,
those
are
sentences
for
misdemeanors
of
less
than
one
year.
here
again,
the
evaluation
is
not
that
sensitive.
we
are
dealing
with
short
sentences
with
much
less
serious
crimes
and
with
a
practical
problem
that
the
county
jails
are
overcrowded
and
they
want
a
faster
turn
over.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
right.
it
is
under
the
old
law.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
think
if
there
is
a
comparable
situation
there,
i
don’t
know
whether
you
can
--
yes,
that
is
true.
if
someone
--
now
if
we’re
comparing
someone
with
both
people
who
are
convicted
of
felonies,
there
is
no
comparable
situation,
neither
of
them
get
good
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
neither
of
them.
but
if
you
are
someone
who
is
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
as
opposed
to
someone
who
is
–
let's
say
both
indicted
for
both.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
misdemeanant
would
get
credit
for
good
time.
mr.
michael
colodner
exactly
the
same
jail
but
it
makes
not
difference
in
those
terms
because
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
misdemeanant,
the
state
legislature
would
set
up
a
system
which
is
purely
custodial
and
it's
a
very
short
sentence
and
they
are
willing
to
give
him
as
much
time
as
they
wish
to
give
him
without
trying
to
set
up
a
program
for
rehabilitation.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
right.
there
is
no
discrimination
against
these
petitioners
in
terms
of
the
goals
of
this
particular
statutory
scheme.
mr.
michael
colodner
definitely
justified.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
say
so
and
i
think
of
the
record
bears
me
up
and
i
think
that
the
majority
of
the
district
courts
didn’t
—
just
didn’t
like
the
statute
because
the
majority
of
the
district
courts
basically
acted
as
a
super
legislature
and
showed
the
state
of
—
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
know
if
judge
hayes
used
that
word,
i
use
that
word
in
my
brief.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
district
court
did.
it
incorrectly
analyzed
the
statute,
it
totally
ignored
every
justification
we
put
forth
by
saying
that,
but
would
not
consider
these
justification
because
they
want
solely
and
exclusively.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
suggest
it
serves
more
than
one
but
that
—
mr.
michael
colodner
at
least
one.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
our
position.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
colodner
your
honor,
i
have
two
minutes
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i’d
like
to
answer
two
of
the
contentions
raised
by
the
attorney
for
the
appellees.
first
of
all
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
clarity
in
the
institution
between
people
who
are
once
sent
to
state
prison
and
then
for
various
reasons
have
to
be
sent
to
institutions
and
one
of
the
examples
raised
is
someone
who
has
to
return
to
the
county
jail
because
he
is
contesting
a
proposed
conviction
proceeding
while
the
court
knows
the
validity
of
his
sentence
and
he
might
remain
in
this
county
jail
for
two
days
or
a
few
weeks
depending
on
how
long
it
takes.
now,
certainly
we
are
not
going
to
say
that
these
people
are
not
to
be
awarded
good
time
because
in
the
course
of
their
program
in
the
state
prison
they
have
to
leave
for
a
short
instance.
in
fact,
if
we
did
deprive
these
people
of
good
time,
we
would
be
raising
serious
constitutional
problems
about
denial
of
access
to
the
courts.
if
a
inmate
in
state
prison
knows
that
if
he
wants
to
utilize
a
state
post-conviction
remedy
but
he
would
also
be
losing
good
time
he
might
be
deterred
in
utilizing
that
remedy.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
colodner
they
are
all
possibilities.
the
system
doesn't
work
on
absolute
perfection,
what
if
someone
was
sick
for
two
weeks.
does
he
get
good
time?
i
would
like
to
add
one
more
thing
and
before
lunch,
the
argument
was
made
that
the
time
allowance
committee
operates
solely
as
the
punitive
entity
it
does
not
at
all.
the
time
allowance
committee
is
what
gives
credit
for
good
time.
this
is
an
evaluation
that
take
takes
into
account
the
entire
institutional
experience
of
the
inmate,
not
whether
he’s
been
good
or
bad.
in
fact
in
the
superintendent's
proceedings
that
was
mentioned
previously
which
is
purely
a
punitive
action
the
time
allowance
committee
can
re-credit
any
time
subtracted
by
the
superintendent's
proceeding
when
the
date—
mr.
michael
colodner
no,
that’s—
mr.
michael
colodner
that's
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
but
my
point
i
am
making
on
this
argument
is
to
show
that
the
time
spent
in
prison
is
evaluated
from
a
rehabilitative
standpoint,
not
necessarily
only
from
a
punitive
standpoint.
thank
you.
