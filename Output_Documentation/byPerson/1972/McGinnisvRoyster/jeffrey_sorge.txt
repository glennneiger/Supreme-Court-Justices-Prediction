mr.
jeffrey
sorge
your
honor
i
believe
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
really
answer
that
question
if
it
refers
to
a
penal
institution
in
france.
i
doubt
very
much
that
the
state
penal
institutions
in
new
york
state
would
be
in
the
position
to
judge
whether
a
person
has
behaved
properly
and
a
penal
institution
in
france
whether
there
are
any
programs,
they
would
really
not
be
able
to
evaluate
any
type
of
program
in
france.
i
believe
that
a
better
example
might
be
let's
say
if
a
person
was
detained
in
new
jersey
and
he
is
expedited
from
new
jersey.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
okay,
alaska,
another
state
of
the
nation.
here
we
have
the
interstate
compact
which
states
that
any
prisoner
in
an
other
state
prison
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
new
york
at
the
same
time
will
be
treated
equally
under
the
law.
so
here
we
would
not
have
the
problems.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is
much
easier
just
because
the
location
of
the
jail,
i
believe
also,
and
it's
indicated
that
the
ultimate
jurisdiction
of
all
jails
is
under
the
department
of
correction.
so
there
are
obviously
intertwined
aspects
here.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
agree
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
would
boil
down
to
the
position
that
really
which
is
position
we
maintain
and
maintain
throughout
this
entire
case
that
it
doesn’t
really
matter
where
they
are
detained.
it
just
matters
what
good
time
is
actually
credited
for.
the
attorney
general
in
his
argument
alleges
that
the
good
time
is
granted
as
an
incentive
for
participation
in
the
rehabilitative
programs,
we
believe
that
there
more
than
sufficient
examples
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
in
our
brief
to
show
that
this
is
not
the
purpose
of
a
good
time
reduction.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
would
refer
of
page
59
(a)
of
the
appendix,
here
the
court
considers
the
differences
between
the
county
jails
and
the
state
prisons
and
i
believe
it's
stated
there
that
whatever
the
differences
are,
it
doesn’t
matter,
because
they
are
reasonably
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
in
other
words
the
court,
the
three-judge
court
is
not
contesting
on
any
differences
between
the
two
jails.
they
are
just
stating
merely
that
whatever
the
differences
are,
these
differences
are
relevant
because
this
differences
are
not
equated
with
giving
good
time
and
in
that
light
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
this
court
did
not
concede
that
there
were
differences
and
did
not
state
that
these
differences
attributed
to
giving
good
time.
and
i
would
like
to
just
pose
an
example.
while
the
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
your
honor,
it’s
extremely
difficult
to
say
whether
the
only
purpose
is
just
for
the
discipline.
i
believe
that
the
court
has
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
if
the
main
purpose
is?
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
as
the
district
court
stated
the
overriding
consideration
in
this
case
is
disciplinary.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
now
i
believe—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
that
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
surely.
i
believe
that
just
by
the
examples
cited
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
in
the
examples
cited
our
brief,
there
are
very
many
situations
where
an
inmate
does
not
have
available
any
rehabilitative
facilities
whatsoever
yet
he
still
gets
good
time
credit
and
i
think
in
a
situation
there,
we
can
see
clearly
that
the
rehabilitative
facilities
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
granting
of
good
time
that's
why
i
see
no
rehabilitative
facilities.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
that,
if
you
take
the
state
prisoners
themselves,
mr.
justice,
there
might
be
a
subordinate
position.
however,
i
would
repeat
that
the
overriding
consideration
is
the
disciplinary
aspect
of
it.
however
in
other
situations
which
come
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
department
of
correction,
we
can
extend
this
argument
even
further
saying
that
the
rehabilitative
facilities
have
absolutely
no
relationship
to
the
grantee
of
good
time.
so,
it
would
be
a
two-fold
argument.
at
one
time
i
am
agreeing
with
your
honor,
at
the
same
time
i
believe
that
the
very
logical
explanation
of
this
is
that
in
very
many
situations
it
does
have
no
relationship
to
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
i
do
realize
that
your
honor
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court,
a
contradiction
to
the
attorney
general's
argument
also
recognize
the
various
standards
imposed
by
dandridge.
they
stated
first
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
only
that
the
state
practice
be
rationally
based
and
free
from
invidious
discrimination.
they
also
stated
that
while
certain
individuals
might
be
substantially
harmed
by
any
form
or
type
of
discrimination
that
this
would
be
okay
if
there
is
a
valid
governmental
objective.
however,
i
believe
that
the
important
aspect
of
this
is
a
court’s
comment
immediately
after
this
and
this
is
found
on
page
59
(a)
of
the
appendix,
the
court
after
citing
these
two
principles
and
after
i
believe
showing
clearly
to
this
court
that
the
lower
court
was
aware
of
their
duty,
the
court
stated
that
they
would
countenance
any
artificial
distinctions,
not
reasonably
related
to
the
statute.
and
i
think
this
is
the
grass
root
problem
here.
the
court
has
determined
that
the
justifications
presented
by
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
are
not
reasonably
related
to
the
statute
and
are
purely
artificial
distinctions.
and
the
attorney
general
your
honor
has
stated
that
the
district
court
has
totally
misapplied
the
equal
protection
standards
and
the
reason
they
misapplied
it,
number
one
is
that
they
did
not
challenge
the
attorney
general’s
argument
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
facility's
purpose
and
usage
of
the
state
jails
versus
the
local
penal
institutions.
now,
we
also
note
that
the
state
has
considered
these
differences
as
i
stated
before
and
they
found
out
that
they
were
not
reasonably
related
to
the
statute.
the
manner
in
which
they
found
–
they
arrived
at
this
conclusion
is
by
looking
at
the
legislative
intention
and
the
manner
in
which
they
did
this
was,
was
civil
and
the
first
case
the
fact
that
good
time
is
a
disciplinary
device
in
the
state
penal
institution
was
readily
conceded
by
the
attorney
general.
also,
we
find
that
in
the
new
york
state
court
this
is
in
the
case
of
perez
versus
follette
which
is
cited
on
page
8
of
our
brief
and
in
page
60
(a)
of
the
appendix,
this
court
while
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
that
good
time
is
an
effective
disciplinary
device.
also
we
find
that
while
this
case
refers
solely
to
the
provisions
of
section
230(3)
which
states
--
or
excuse
me
--
which
draws
the
distinction
between
the
county
inmates
who
are
subsequently
send
to
the
state
and
persons
who
are
not
so
detained
prior
to
being
sentenced.
the
courts
in
new
york
have
also
considered
the
following
subsection,
this
is
330(4)
and
this
concerns
the
maximum
release
date.
now,
there
is
a
very
clear
distinction
between
the
two
sections
as
far
as
the
line
in
which
it
is
applied.
the
court
will
notice
that
in
subdivision
3
the
legislatures
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
no,
your
honor.
i’ve
submitted
to
this
court
that
that
gives
an
indication
of
what
the
state's
purpose
is
as
far
as
that
section
is
concerned,
that’s
the
limited
purpose
on
some
of
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
that's
a
interpretation
of
statute
but
i
think
at
the
same
time
we
can
find
out
--
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
this
is
an
interpretation
that
shows
the
legislative
intent
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
no,
that
this
--
it’s
very
difficult
to
say
whether
this
was
the
only
intent
because
the
case
doesn't
–
it's
trying
to
find
that
factor
really.
however,
there
are
other
considerations
that
the
court
should
look
at
when
they
look
at
the
legislative
stand
not
only
one
case
that
was
decided
by
the
court.
as
i
was
explaining
before
the
difference
between
subdivision
3
and
subdivision
4
of
the
section
230
of
the
new
york
correction
law,
draws
clear
distinction
between
in
one
case
the
pretrial
detention
of
prisoners
as
far
as
good
time
under
minimum
sentence
is
concerned
and
pretrial
detention
of
prisoners
as
far
as
their
maximum
or
conditional
release
date
from
a
state
penitentiary.
the
first
subdivision,
subdivision
3
specifically
states
that
this
good
time
should
be
determined
on
the
amount
of
the
minimum
sentence
less
jail
time.
subdivision
4
however,
does
not
refer
to
jail
time
whatsoever.
in
people
versus
deegan
and
the
case
of
paul
versus
warden
who
served
at
county
jail
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
at
page
68
and
also
page
8
of
our
brief,
this
very
issue
of
whether
jail
time
should
be
included
or
excluded
in
the
computation
of
good
time
to
be
provided
in
the
determination
of
the
maximum
sentence
was
raised.
and
what
was
the
argument
by
the
state
in
both
of
those
cases?
in
both
of
those
cases
the
state
argued
that
there
are
differences
between
the
county
jail
and
differences
between
the
state
jails.
there
are
differences
in
purpose,
usage
and
facility
and
both
in
of
those
cases
the
courts
rejected
the
state
argument.
and
i
believe
that's
very
important
to
show
the
legislative
purpose
their.
another
example,
when
a
prisoner
arrives
at
a
state
penal
institution
after
being
transferred
from
the
county
jail,
when
is
his
good
time
computed?
it's
computed
immediately
upon
his
arrival.
and
i
believe
the
statement
of
the
district
court
is
very
correct,
when
it
states
that
this
indicates
that
a
prisoner
does
not
earn
good
time
credit,
when
he
is
in
state
penitentiary,
instead
he
is
penalized
for
bad
behavior
and
how
is
he
penalized?
i
believe
the
state
legislature
made
this
quite
clear
in
establishing
various
boards
for
discipline
the
person
and
also
for
determining
when
good
time
should
be
allowed.
there
are
two
boards.
we
have
--
i
am
referring
to
one,
this
is
the,
what
they
call
the
superintendent
proceeding.
this
superintendent
proceeding
is
a
proceeding
that
is
used
whenever
there
is
disciplinary
action
taken
against
the
prisoner
in
a
state
prison.
this
action
arises
whenever
there
is
misbehavior
involving
a
danger
to
life,
health,
security
or
property
or
in
a
case
where
there
are
persistent
minor
violations
against
the
rules
of
the
prison.
this
is
a
very
elaborate
procedure
which
starts
where
a
report
is
filed
by
one
of
the
sheriffs
or
one
of
the
guards
on
the
floor.
this
report
is
subsequently
forwarded
to
what
they
call
the
adjustment
committee.
the
adjustment
committee
reviews
the
report.
the
adjustment
committee
may
take
three
actions,
it
may
recommend
reappraisal
of
the
prisoner's
program,
it
may
recommend
nullification
of
the
report
or
it
may
take
what
they
call
adjustment
committee
action.
adjustment
committee
action
very
briefly
is
an
action
where
they
discuss
the
problem
where
the
person
who
are
involved,
the
inmates
and
the
guards
on
the
floor
etcetera,
and
after
this
adjustment
committee
rules
on
this
case,
it
may
take
further
action.
it
may
confine
a
person
in
his
cell
or
it
may
confine
the
inmate
in
a
private
housing
unit
or
it
may
take
away
specific
privileges.
up
to
this
time
we
must
realize
that
there
is
absolutely
no
provision
for
taking
away
good
time.
good
time
is
taken
away
subsequently,
they
have
to
go
through
further
proceedings
to
get
to
the
point
where
they
can
actually
take
away
good
time.
after
the
adjustment
committee
has
made
their
ruling,
only
until
there
are
persistent
violations
after
that
could
they
possibly
refer
this
to
a
superintendent
proceeding.
at
a
superintendent's
proceeding
if
one
has
had—we
have
a
formal
procedure
of
due
process
where
a
person
is
represented
by
employee
of
the
state
prisons
they
charge—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
exactly
your
honor.
not
administrative
remedies
really
your
honor,
this
is
an
administrative
procedure
for
taking
away
good
time.
there
are
only
two
procedures
which
find
—
that
we
can
find
for
taking
away
good
time.
this
is
one
of
them.
and
i’m
using
this
example
merely
to
show
the
disciplinary
and
the
punitive
nature
of
this,
to
show
that
the
factor
of
good
time
is
based
upon
good
behavior.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
am
not
exactly
sure
if
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
as
far
as
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
well
section
230(3)
does.
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
oh
definitely
not.
the
statute
states
specifically
on
that
decision
as
to
what
the
state
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
no
i
believe
it
would
not.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
it
is
contrary
to
the
fact,
all
i
have
to
do
is
look
at
file
sent
from
the
in
the
county
jails
which
indicate
what
jail
times
should
be
credited
to
the
person
and
also
get
support
for
all
of
the
defendant's
actions.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor.
as
far
good
behavior
is
concerned,
i
don’t
believe
that
you
have
to
have
a
very
complicated
procedure
to
determine
whether
a
person
is
being
faithfully
abiding
by
the
rules
of
a
specific
penal
institution.
i
don’t
believe
that
there
should
be
a
difference
in
the
location
of
the
detention
facility
as
far
as
good
behavior
is
concerned.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
just
believe
that
it
might
be
a
little
bit
too
complex
and
i
am
not
really
prepared
to
argue
that
issue.
there
is
a
very
good
possibility
that
it
would
apply
equally
to
that
jurisdiction
also.
i
believe
also
that
while
we
have
–
returning
to
the
superintendent's
proceeding,
here
we
have
one
example
of
administrative
action
or
procedure
which
is
definitely
punitive
in
nature
and
it’s
a
definitely
a
disciplinary
board
in
nature
which
takes
away
good
time.
in
response
to
this
the
attorney
general
stated
that
there
is
another
board,
this
is
a
time
allowance
committee
and
he
says
that
the
time
allowance
committee
considers
more
than
just
the
behavior
of
the
inmate
while
in
prison
in
determining
whether
good
time
should
be
allowed
or
not.
and
i
would
like
to
state
--
specifically
i
would
like
to
quote
from
a
statute
which
determines
or
which
directs
exactly
what
the
purpose
of
this
committee
is.
this
is
found
on
page
68
of
the
appendix
and
also
recognizing
the
appellants
brief
on
page
6.
they
state
that
in
regards
to
this
board
whether
they
should
allow
good
time
or
not,
they
said
the
board
shall
have
discretion
of
withholding
the
good
time
allowance
as
and
i
quote
“a
punishment
for
offenses
against
the
discipline
of
the
prison
or
penitentiary
in
accordance
with
the
rules
herein
before
mentioned.
reduction
credited
to
a
prisoner
in
the
first
instance,
in
his
account,
by
the
warden,
as
provided
in
section
230
shall
stand
as
the
reduction
allowed,
unless
withheld
wholly
or
partly
by
the
board
as
punishment,
as
above
provided."
i
believe
this
purely
shows
and
clearly
shows
the
legislative
intention
that
the
reduction
of
good
time
is
a
punishment
for
bad
behavior
in
a
prison.
and
then
also
there
are
very
many
situations
where
good
time
is
credited
to
other
persons
in
different
situations.
such
as
good
time
is
credited
to
both
misdemeanants
and
felons
serving
definite
sentences
in
county
jails
and
this
is
very
important
because
the
language
referring
to
these
individuals
which
is
section
250
of
the
correction
law
states
that
good
performance
or
a
good
time
shall
be
credited
based
upon
the
defendant's
behavior,
conduct
and
his
efficient
and
willing
performance
of
duty
in
that
county
penitentiary.
it
is
exactly
the
same
language
as
contained
in
section
230(3).
and
i
believe
that
this
would
undermine
the
attorney
general's
argument
that
any
difference
in
usage,
purpose
or
availability
of
facilities,
in
the
county
jail
versus
the
state
penal
institutions
is
a
determinative
factor
in
deciding
good
time.
and
in
this
regard
i
would
like
to
used
another
example
while
we
are
contesting
mainly
or
while
we
are
considering
mainly
the
local
county
jail
as
the
pretrial
detention
facilities,
there
are
other
pretrial
detention
facilities
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
don’t
have
the
--
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
before
whether
they
had
a
pretrial
facility
which
really
was
not
detention,
which
was
a
minimum
security
facility,
they
do
not
have
any
such
thing
in
new
york.
however,
they
do
have
two
other
facilities
for
pretrial
detentions.
if
a
person
is
found
to
be
criminally
insane
and
not
competent
to
assist
his
attorney
in
presenting
the
defense
in
his
case
then
he
maybe
certified
to
the
various
state
institutions
in
the
state
of
new
york.
these
are
state
institutions
for
the
mentally
retarded.
they
have
two
such
state
institutes,
one
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commissioners
of
mental
hygiene,
the
second
one
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commissioner
of
correction
the
person
involved
in
this
case.
the
commissioner
of
correction
has
jurisdiction
over
two
such
facilities.
this
are
matteawan
state
hospital
and
dannemora
state
hospital
and
while
a
person
--
may
i
just
continue
this
i
will
conclude
it
--
while
a
person
is
there,
he
is
receiving
rehabilitative
facilities,
he’s
receiving
rehabilitative
treatment.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
immediately
prior
to
the
luncheon
recess
of
this
court,
i
was
describing
how
the
county
jails
are
not
the
only
pretrial
detention
facilities
in
the
state
of
new
york,
there
are
other
detention
facilities
one
of
which
are
the
state
hospitals
for
the
persons
who
are
mentally
incapable
of
standing
trial.
these
state
hospitals
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
department
of
correction.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
your
honor,
not
only
these
pretrial
detention
facilities,
however
there
are
also
facilities
which
receive
inmates
who
are
transferred
from
the
state
prisons
to
the
mental
institutions
and
for
the
period
of
time
that
these
mental
patients
stay
in
these
institutions
the
state
commission
of
correction
does
grant
them
good
time.
so
i
believe
that
they—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor
but
this
would
be
--
they
are
not
really
applying
the
standards
because
he
is
being
confined
due
to
their
mental
problem.
they
are
computing
this
because
he’s
been
transferred
from
a
state
prison
where
he’s
already
been
subjected
to
an
indeterminate
sentence
and
then
sending
him
to
the
mental
hospitals.
so
he
is
still
under
the
custody
of
the
commissioner
of
correction.
now,
while
the
commissioner
of
correction
does
give
the
good
time
credit
for
a
person
who
has
been
transferred
from
the
state
prison,
we
submit
that
there
are
different
usages,
purposes
and
availability
facilities
in
the
mental
hospitals.
and
we
believe
it's
obvious
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
mental
hospitals
and
the
state
jails.
to
counter
this
argument
the
attorney
general
stated
in
page
7
of
his
reply
brief
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
this
diminishes
the
validity
of
section
230(3).
these
are
two
classes
of
inmates
who
have
been
transferred
to
state
institutions
that
have
programs
specifically
designed
for
their
specialized
needs.
willing
participation
and
performance
in
these
treatment
programs
under
state's
supervision
which
certainly
call
for
the
awarding
of
good
time.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court
readily
that
this
is
quite
a
cogent
argument.
however,
i
would
pose
a
question
to
the
attorney
general
if
these
programs
or
if
these
facilities
do
have
programs
that
are
beneficial
to
the
inmates
and
if
they
do
believe
that
these
programs
meet
the
specialized
needs
of
the
inmates
then
why
does
not
the
commissioner
of
correction
give
good
time
credit
for
the
amount
of
time
that
a
person
spends
in
these
exact
facilities
if
its
pretrial
confinement.
they
do
not
give
good
time
on
this
period
of
time.
so
i
believe
that
the
different
types
of
programs
is
not
related
to
the
giving
of
good
time
and
i
think
this
is
specific
example
which
points
that
out
clearly.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
it
would
be
somewhat
of
a
basis,
because
i
believe
in
the
first
place
it
shows
a
practice
in
new
york
state.
in
the
second
place
i
would
argue
that
it
is
at
least
an
indication
of
the
state's
intention.
i
believe
also
that
we
find
that
there
is
supposedly
a
uniform
scheme
of
granting,
the
computation
of
a
person's
sentence.
i
believe
that
this
would
also
have
an
effect
on
that.
i
believe
that
this
presents
a
definite
conflict
in
the
states
practice.
secondly
we
have
other
examples
which
present
similar
examples
of
conflict.
for
example,
if
the
person
is
already
been
sentenced
and
has
been
received
in
a
state
prison,
if
he
is
subsequently
transferred
back
to
a
county
jail
for
a
post-conviction
remedy
and
remains
in
the
county
jail
until
that
post-conviction
remedy
is
completed,
then
transferred
back
to
the
state
prison,
he
gets
good
time
credit
for
the
amount
of
time
that
he
spent
in
the
county
jail.
so
here
he
is
being
detained
in
exactly
the
same
facility
as
are
the
persons
that
are
discriminated
against
under
section
230(3),
however
as
a
matter
of
policy
of
new
york
state,
he
is
getting
good
time
credit
for
that.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
is
an
incredible
inconsistency
and
i
believe
that
the
explanation
just
submitted
to
mr.
chief
justice
would
apply
equally
here.
here
is
an
indication
of
the
intent
of
the
legislature
etcetera.
lastly
as
the
attorney
general
has
argued
that
the
district
court
misapplied
the
standards
of
the
equal
protection
in
that
it
did
not
consider
their
argument
that
good
time
should
not
be
reduced
from
the
pretrial
detention
period
because
in
effect
it
reduces
the
amount
of
time
that
a
parole
board
has
to
consider
whether
a
person
should
be
eligible
or
not
for
parole.
i
submit
that
the
district
court
did
in
fact
consider
this
proposition.
on
page
63
(a)
of
the
appendix,
the
district
court
came
out
in
extremely
strong
language
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
stated
that
the
fears
of
the
district
attorney
--
excuse
me
--
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
are
wholly
illusory.
i
believe
this
is
very
clear
statement
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
your
honor
i
believe
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
really
answer
that
question
if
it
refers
to
a
penal
institution
in
france.
i
doubt
very
much
that
the
state
penal
institutions
in
new
york
state
would
be
in
the
position
to
judge
whether
a
person
has
behaved
properly
and
a
penal
institution
in
france
whether
there
are
any
programs,
they
would
really
not
be
able
to
evaluate
any
type
of
program
in
france.
i
believe
that
a
better
example
might
be
let's
say
if
a
person
was
detained
in
new
jersey
and
he
is
expedited
from
new
jersey.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
okay,
alaska,
another
state
of
the
nation.
here
we
have
the
interstate
compact
which
states
that
any
prisoner
in
an
other
state
prison
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
new
york
at
the
same
time
will
be
treated
equally
under
the
law.
so
here
we
would
not
have
the
problems.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is
much
easier
just
because
the
location
of
the
jail,
i
believe
also,
and
it's
indicated
that
the
ultimate
jurisdiction
of
all
jails
is
under
the
department
of
correction.
so
there
are
obviously
intertwined
aspects
here.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
agree
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
would
boil
down
to
the
position
that
really
which
is
position
we
maintain
and
maintain
throughout
this
entire
case
that
it
doesn’t
really
matter
where
they
are
detained.
it
just
matters
what
good
time
is
actually
credited
for.
the
attorney
general
in
his
argument
alleges
that
the
good
time
is
granted
as
an
incentive
for
participation
in
the
rehabilitative
programs,
we
believe
that
there
more
than
sufficient
examples
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
in
our
brief
to
show
that
this
is
not
the
purpose
of
a
good
time
reduction.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
would
refer
of
page
59
(a)
of
the
appendix,
here
the
court
considers
the
differences
between
the
county
jails
and
the
state
prisons
and
i
believe
it's
stated
there
that
whatever
the
differences
are,
it
doesn’t
matter,
because
they
are
reasonably
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
in
other
words
the
court,
the
three-judge
court
is
not
contesting
on
any
differences
between
the
two
jails.
they
are
just
stating
merely
that
whatever
the
differences
are,
these
differences
are
relevant
because
this
differences
are
not
equated
with
giving
good
time
and
in
that
light
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
this
court
did
not
concede
that
there
were
differences
and
did
not
state
that
these
differences
attributed
to
giving
good
time.
and
i
would
like
to
just
pose
an
example.
while
the
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
your
honor,
it’s
extremely
difficult
to
say
whether
the
only
purpose
is
just
for
the
discipline.
i
believe
that
the
court
has
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
if
the
main
purpose
is?
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
as
the
district
court
stated
the
overriding
consideration
in
this
case
is
disciplinary.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
now
i
believe—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
that
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
surely.
i
believe
that
just
by
the
examples
cited
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
in
the
examples
cited
our
brief,
there
are
very
many
situations
where
an
inmate
does
not
have
available
any
rehabilitative
facilities
whatsoever
yet
he
still
gets
good
time
credit
and
i
think
in
a
situation
there,
we
can
see
clearly
that
the
rehabilitative
facilities
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
granting
of
good
time
that's
why
i
see
no
rehabilitative
facilities.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
that,
if
you
take
the
state
prisoners
themselves,
mr.
justice,
there
might
be
a
subordinate
position.
however,
i
would
repeat
that
the
overriding
consideration
is
the
disciplinary
aspect
of
it.
however
in
other
situations
which
come
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
department
of
correction,
we
can
extend
this
argument
even
further
saying
that
the
rehabilitative
facilities
have
absolutely
no
relationship
to
the
grantee
of
good
time.
so,
it
would
be
a
two-fold
argument.
at
one
time
i
am
agreeing
with
your
honor,
at
the
same
time
i
believe
that
the
very
logical
explanation
of
this
is
that
in
very
many
situations
it
does
have
no
relationship
to
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
i
do
realize
that
your
honor
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court,
a
contradiction
to
the
attorney
general's
argument
also
recognize
the
various
standards
imposed
by
dandridge.
they
stated
first
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
only
that
the
state
practice
be
rationally
based
and
free
from
invidious
discrimination.
they
also
stated
that
while
certain
individuals
might
be
substantially
harmed
by
any
form
or
type
of
discrimination
that
this
would
be
okay
if
there
is
a
valid
governmental
objective.
however,
i
believe
that
the
important
aspect
of
this
is
a
court’s
comment
immediately
after
this
and
this
is
found
on
page
59
(a)
of
the
appendix,
the
court
after
citing
these
two
principles
and
after
i
believe
showing
clearly
to
this
court
that
the
lower
court
was
aware
of
their
duty,
the
court
stated
that
they
would
countenance
any
artificial
distinctions,
not
reasonably
related
to
the
statute.
and
i
think
this
is
the
grass
root
problem
here.
the
court
has
determined
that
the
justifications
presented
by
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
are
not
reasonably
related
to
the
statute
and
are
purely
artificial
distinctions.
and
the
attorney
general
your
honor
has
stated
that
the
district
court
has
totally
misapplied
the
equal
protection
standards
and
the
reason
they
misapplied
it,
number
one
is
that
they
did
not
challenge
the
attorney
general’s
argument
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
facility's
purpose
and
usage
of
the
state
jails
versus
the
local
penal
institutions.
now,
we
also
note
that
the
state
has
considered
these
differences
as
i
stated
before
and
they
found
out
that
they
were
not
reasonably
related
to
the
statute.
the
manner
in
which
they
found
–
they
arrived
at
this
conclusion
is
by
looking
at
the
legislative
intention
and
the
manner
in
which
they
did
this
was,
was
civil
and
the
first
case
the
fact
that
good
time
is
a
disciplinary
device
in
the
state
penal
institution
was
readily
conceded
by
the
attorney
general.
also,
we
find
that
in
the
new
york
state
court
this
is
in
the
case
of
perez
versus
follette
which
is
cited
on
page
8
of
our
brief
and
in
page
60
(a)
of
the
appendix,
this
court
while
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
that
good
time
is
an
effective
disciplinary
device.
also
we
find
that
while
this
case
refers
solely
to
the
provisions
of
section
230(3)
which
states
--
or
excuse
me
--
which
draws
the
distinction
between
the
county
inmates
who
are
subsequently
send
to
the
state
and
persons
who
are
not
so
detained
prior
to
being
sentenced.
the
courts
in
new
york
have
also
considered
the
following
subsection,
this
is
330(4)
and
this
concerns
the
maximum
release
date.
now,
there
is
a
very
clear
distinction
between
the
two
sections
as
far
as
the
line
in
which
it
is
applied.
the
court
will
notice
that
in
subdivision
3
the
legislatures
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
no,
your
honor.
i’ve
submitted
to
this
court
that
that
gives
an
indication
of
what
the
state's
purpose
is
as
far
as
that
section
is
concerned,
that’s
the
limited
purpose
on
some
of
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
that's
a
interpretation
of
statute
but
i
think
at
the
same
time
we
can
find
out
--
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
this
is
an
interpretation
that
shows
the
legislative
intent
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
no,
that
this
--
it’s
very
difficult
to
say
whether
this
was
the
only
intent
because
the
case
doesn't
–
it's
trying
to
find
that
factor
really.
however,
there
are
other
considerations
that
the
court
should
look
at
when
they
look
at
the
legislative
stand
not
only
one
case
that
was
decided
by
the
court.
as
i
was
explaining
before
the
difference
between
subdivision
3
and
subdivision
4
of
the
section
230
of
the
new
york
correction
law,
draws
clear
distinction
between
in
one
case
the
pretrial
detention
of
prisoners
as
far
as
good
time
under
minimum
sentence
is
concerned
and
pretrial
detention
of
prisoners
as
far
as
their
maximum
or
conditional
release
date
from
a
state
penitentiary.
the
first
subdivision,
subdivision
3
specifically
states
that
this
good
time
should
be
determined
on
the
amount
of
the
minimum
sentence
less
jail
time.
subdivision
4
however,
does
not
refer
to
jail
time
whatsoever.
in
people
versus
deegan
and
the
case
of
paul
versus
warden
who
served
at
county
jail
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
at
page
68
and
also
page
8
of
our
brief,
this
very
issue
of
whether
jail
time
should
be
included
or
excluded
in
the
computation
of
good
time
to
be
provided
in
the
determination
of
the
maximum
sentence
was
raised.
and
what
was
the
argument
by
the
state
in
both
of
those
cases?
in
both
of
those
cases
the
state
argued
that
there
are
differences
between
the
county
jail
and
differences
between
the
state
jails.
there
are
differences
in
purpose,
usage
and
facility
and
both
in
of
those
cases
the
courts
rejected
the
state
argument.
and
i
believe
that's
very
important
to
show
the
legislative
purpose
their.
another
example,
when
a
prisoner
arrives
at
a
state
penal
institution
after
being
transferred
from
the
county
jail,
when
is
his
good
time
computed?
it's
computed
immediately
upon
his
arrival.
and
i
believe
the
statement
of
the
district
court
is
very
correct,
when
it
states
that
this
indicates
that
a
prisoner
does
not
earn
good
time
credit,
when
he
is
in
state
penitentiary,
instead
he
is
penalized
for
bad
behavior
and
how
is
he
penalized?
i
believe
the
state
legislature
made
this
quite
clear
in
establishing
various
boards
for
discipline
the
person
and
also
for
determining
when
good
time
should
be
allowed.
there
are
two
boards.
we
have
--
i
am
referring
to
one,
this
is
the,
what
they
call
the
superintendent
proceeding.
this
superintendent
proceeding
is
a
proceeding
that
is
used
whenever
there
is
disciplinary
action
taken
against
the
prisoner
in
a
state
prison.
this
action
arises
whenever
there
is
misbehavior
involving
a
danger
to
life,
health,
security
or
property
or
in
a
case
where
there
are
persistent
minor
violations
against
the
rules
of
the
prison.
this
is
a
very
elaborate
procedure
which
starts
where
a
report
is
filed
by
one
of
the
sheriffs
or
one
of
the
guards
on
the
floor.
this
report
is
subsequently
forwarded
to
what
they
call
the
adjustment
committee.
the
adjustment
committee
reviews
the
report.
the
adjustment
committee
may
take
three
actions,
it
may
recommend
reappraisal
of
the
prisoner's
program,
it
may
recommend
nullification
of
the
report
or
it
may
take
what
they
call
adjustment
committee
action.
adjustment
committee
action
very
briefly
is
an
action
where
they
discuss
the
problem
where
the
person
who
are
involved,
the
inmates
and
the
guards
on
the
floor
etcetera,
and
after
this
adjustment
committee
rules
on
this
case,
it
may
take
further
action.
it
may
confine
a
person
in
his
cell
or
it
may
confine
the
inmate
in
a
private
housing
unit
or
it
may
take
away
specific
privileges.
up
to
this
time
we
must
realize
that
there
is
absolutely
no
provision
for
taking
away
good
time.
good
time
is
taken
away
subsequently,
they
have
to
go
through
further
proceedings
to
get
to
the
point
where
they
can
actually
take
away
good
time.
after
the
adjustment
committee
has
made
their
ruling,
only
until
there
are
persistent
violations
after
that
could
they
possibly
refer
this
to
a
superintendent
proceeding.
at
a
superintendent's
proceeding
if
one
has
had—we
have
a
formal
procedure
of
due
process
where
a
person
is
represented
by
employee
of
the
state
prisons
they
charge—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
exactly
your
honor.
not
administrative
remedies
really
your
honor,
this
is
an
administrative
procedure
for
taking
away
good
time.
there
are
only
two
procedures
which
find
—
that
we
can
find
for
taking
away
good
time.
this
is
one
of
them.
and
i’m
using
this
example
merely
to
show
the
disciplinary
and
the
punitive
nature
of
this,
to
show
that
the
factor
of
good
time
is
based
upon
good
behavior.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
am
not
exactly
sure
if
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
as
far
as
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
well
section
230(3)
does.
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
oh
definitely
not.
the
statute
states
specifically
on
that
decision
as
to
what
the
state
—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
no
i
believe
it
would
not.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
it
is
contrary
to
the
fact,
all
i
have
to
do
is
look
at
file
sent
from
the
in
the
county
jails
which
indicate
what
jail
times
should
be
credited
to
the
person
and
also
get
support
for
all
of
the
defendant's
actions.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor.
as
far
good
behavior
is
concerned,
i
don’t
believe
that
you
have
to
have
a
very
complicated
procedure
to
determine
whether
a
person
is
being
faithfully
abiding
by
the
rules
of
a
specific
penal
institution.
i
don’t
believe
that
there
should
be
a
difference
in
the
location
of
the
detention
facility
as
far
as
good
behavior
is
concerned.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
just
believe
that
it
might
be
a
little
bit
too
complex
and
i
am
not
really
prepared
to
argue
that
issue.
there
is
a
very
good
possibility
that
it
would
apply
equally
to
that
jurisdiction
also.
i
believe
also
that
while
we
have
–
returning
to
the
superintendent's
proceeding,
here
we
have
one
example
of
administrative
action
or
procedure
which
is
definitely
punitive
in
nature
and
it’s
a
definitely
a
disciplinary
board
in
nature
which
takes
away
good
time.
in
response
to
this
the
attorney
general
stated
that
there
is
another
board,
this
is
a
time
allowance
committee
and
he
says
that
the
time
allowance
committee
considers
more
than
just
the
behavior
of
the
inmate
while
in
prison
in
determining
whether
good
time
should
be
allowed
or
not.
and
i
would
like
to
state
--
specifically
i
would
like
to
quote
from
a
statute
which
determines
or
which
directs
exactly
what
the
purpose
of
this
committee
is.
this
is
found
on
page
68
of
the
appendix
and
also
recognizing
the
appellants
brief
on
page
6.
they
state
that
in
regards
to
this
board
whether
they
should
allow
good
time
or
not,
they
said
the
board
shall
have
discretion
of
withholding
the
good
time
allowance
as
and
i
quote
“a
punishment
for
offenses
against
the
discipline
of
the
prison
or
penitentiary
in
accordance
with
the
rules
herein
before
mentioned.
reduction
credited
to
a
prisoner
in
the
first
instance,
in
his
account,
by
the
warden,
as
provided
in
section
230
shall
stand
as
the
reduction
allowed,
unless
withheld
wholly
or
partly
by
the
board
as
punishment,
as
above
provided."
i
believe
this
purely
shows
and
clearly
shows
the
legislative
intention
that
the
reduction
of
good
time
is
a
punishment
for
bad
behavior
in
a
prison.
and
then
also
there
are
very
many
situations
where
good
time
is
credited
to
other
persons
in
different
situations.
such
as
good
time
is
credited
to
both
misdemeanants
and
felons
serving
definite
sentences
in
county
jails
and
this
is
very
important
because
the
language
referring
to
these
individuals
which
is
section
250
of
the
correction
law
states
that
good
performance
or
a
good
time
shall
be
credited
based
upon
the
defendant's
behavior,
conduct
and
his
efficient
and
willing
performance
of
duty
in
that
county
penitentiary.
it
is
exactly
the
same
language
as
contained
in
section
230(3).
and
i
believe
that
this
would
undermine
the
attorney
general's
argument
that
any
difference
in
usage,
purpose
or
availability
of
facilities,
in
the
county
jail
versus
the
state
penal
institutions
is
a
determinative
factor
in
deciding
good
time.
and
in
this
regard
i
would
like
to
used
another
example
while
we
are
contesting
mainly
or
while
we
are
considering
mainly
the
local
county
jail
as
the
pretrial
detention
facilities,
there
are
other
pretrial
detention
facilities
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
don’t
have
the
--
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
before
whether
they
had
a
pretrial
facility
which
really
was
not
detention,
which
was
a
minimum
security
facility,
they
do
not
have
any
such
thing
in
new
york.
however,
they
do
have
two
other
facilities
for
pretrial
detentions.
if
a
person
is
found
to
be
criminally
insane
and
not
competent
to
assist
his
attorney
in
presenting
the
defense
in
his
case
then
he
maybe
certified
to
the
various
state
institutions
in
the
state
of
new
york.
these
are
state
institutions
for
the
mentally
retarded.
they
have
two
such
state
institutes,
one
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commissioners
of
mental
hygiene,
the
second
one
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commissioner
of
correction
the
person
involved
in
this
case.
the
commissioner
of
correction
has
jurisdiction
over
two
such
facilities.
this
are
matteawan
state
hospital
and
dannemora
state
hospital
and
while
a
person
--
may
i
just
continue
this
i
will
conclude
it
--
while
a
person
is
there,
he
is
receiving
rehabilitative
facilities,
he’s
receiving
rehabilitative
treatment.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
immediately
prior
to
the
luncheon
recess
of
this
court,
i
was
describing
how
the
county
jails
are
not
the
only
pretrial
detention
facilities
in
the
state
of
new
york,
there
are
other
detention
facilities
one
of
which
are
the
state
hospitals
for
the
persons
who
are
mentally
incapable
of
standing
trial.
these
state
hospitals
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
department
of
correction.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
your
honor,
not
only
these
pretrial
detention
facilities,
however
there
are
also
facilities
which
receive
inmates
who
are
transferred
from
the
state
prisons
to
the
mental
institutions
and
for
the
period
of
time
that
these
mental
patients
stay
in
these
institutions
the
state
commission
of
correction
does
grant
them
good
time.
so
i
believe
that
they—
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
yes,
your
honor
but
this
would
be
--
they
are
not
really
applying
the
standards
because
he
is
being
confined
due
to
their
mental
problem.
they
are
computing
this
because
he’s
been
transferred
from
a
state
prison
where
he’s
already
been
subjected
to
an
indeterminate
sentence
and
then
sending
him
to
the
mental
hospitals.
so
he
is
still
under
the
custody
of
the
commissioner
of
correction.
now,
while
the
commissioner
of
correction
does
give
the
good
time
credit
for
a
person
who
has
been
transferred
from
the
state
prison,
we
submit
that
there
are
different
usages,
purposes
and
availability
facilities
in
the
mental
hospitals.
and
we
believe
it's
obvious
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
mental
hospitals
and
the
state
jails.
to
counter
this
argument
the
attorney
general
stated
in
page
7
of
his
reply
brief
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
this
diminishes
the
validity
of
section
230(3).
these
are
two
classes
of
inmates
who
have
been
transferred
to
state
institutions
that
have
programs
specifically
designed
for
their
specialized
needs.
willing
participation
and
performance
in
these
treatment
programs
under
state's
supervision
which
certainly
call
for
the
awarding
of
good
time.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court
readily
that
this
is
quite
a
cogent
argument.
however,
i
would
pose
a
question
to
the
attorney
general
if
these
programs
or
if
these
facilities
do
have
programs
that
are
beneficial
to
the
inmates
and
if
they
do
believe
that
these
programs
meet
the
specialized
needs
of
the
inmates
then
why
does
not
the
commissioner
of
correction
give
good
time
credit
for
the
amount
of
time
that
a
person
spends
in
these
exact
facilities
if
its
pretrial
confinement.
they
do
not
give
good
time
on
this
period
of
time.
so
i
believe
that
the
different
types
of
programs
is
not
related
to
the
giving
of
good
time
and
i
think
this
is
specific
example
which
points
that
out
clearly.
mr.
jeffrey
sorge
i
believe
it
would
be
somewhat
of
a
basis,
because
i
believe
in
the
first
place
it
shows
a
practice
in
new
york
state.
in
the
second
place
i
would
argue
that
it
is
at
least
an
indication
of
the
state's
intention.
i
believe
also
that
we
find
that
there
is
supposedly
a
uniform
scheme
of
granting,
the
computation
of
a
person's
sentence.
i
believe
that
this
would
also
have
an
effect
on
that.
i
believe
that
this
presents
a
definite
conflict
in
the
states
practice.
secondly
we
have
other
examples
which
present
similar
examples
of
conflict.
for
example,
if
the
person
is
already
been
sentenced
and
has
been
received
in
a
state
prison,
if
he
is
subsequently
transferred
back
to
a
county
jail
for
a
post-conviction
remedy
and
remains
in
the
county
jail
until
that
post-conviction
remedy
is
completed,
then
transferred
back
to
the
state
prison,
he
gets
good
time
credit
for
the
amount
of
time
that
he
spent
in
the
county
jail.
so
here
he
is
being
detained
in
exactly
the
same
facility
as
are
the
persons
that
are
discriminated
against
under
section
230(3),
however
as
a
matter
of
policy
of
new
york
state,
he
is
getting
good
time
credit
for
that.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
is
an
incredible
inconsistency
and
i
believe
that
the
explanation
just
submitted
to
mr.
chief
justice
would
apply
equally
here.
here
is
an
indication
of
the
intent
of
the
legislature
etcetera.
lastly
as
the
attorney
general
has
argued
that
the
district
court
misapplied
the
standards
of
the
equal
protection
in
that
it
did
not
consider
their
argument
that
good
time
should
not
be
reduced
from
the
pretrial
detention
period
because
in
effect
it
reduces
the
amount
of
time
that
a
parole
board
has
to
consider
whether
a
person
should
be
eligible
or
not
for
parole.
i
submit
that
the
district
court
did
in
fact
consider
this
proposition.
on
page
63
(a)
of
the
appendix,
the
district
court
came
out
in
extremely
strong
language
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
stated
that
the
fears
of
the
district
attorney
--
excuse
me
--
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
are
wholly
illusory.
i
believe
this
is
very
clear
statement
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
