mr.
william
c.
cramer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
first
put
in
focus
as
i
see
it
speech
and
debate
as
compared
to
separation
of
powers.
speech
and
debate
is
a
part
of
separation
of
powers
and
most
specifically
stated
in
u.s.
v.
johnson
“the
speech
and
debate
clause
serves
a
function
of
reinforcing
the
speech
and
debate
powers
to
deliberately
establish
by
the
founding
fathers
therefore
separation
of
powers
is
emphasized
and
it
is
reinforced
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
not
limited
by.
then
let
me
get
it
in,
in
view
of
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
and
i
would
suggest,
i
would
be
most
helpful
to
the
court
the
questions,
some
of
the
questions
raise
with
regards
to
perhaps
in
spreading
the
information.
once
a
committee
report
properly
printed
by
the
congress
ordered
by
the
congress
to
be
printed
pursuant
to
a
resolution
of
the
congress
and
unquestionably
pursuant
to
the
power
of
congress
because
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
congress
as
the
sole
legislator
and
sole
governor
of
under
the
constitution
article
i
section
8
of
the
district
of
columbia,
and
in
those
instances
there
is
no
question
with
what
the
committee
report
itself
is
beyond
question
by
this
court
and
by
anyone
else.
it
is
a
legislative
act.
being
a
legislative
act,
it
is
beyond
the
province
of
this
court
as
it
would
be
of
the
executive
to
inquire
into
the
motives
of
the
members
why
they
put
in
the
information
in
that
is
the
decision
by
the
duly
elected
representative
how
he
makes
a
mistake.
he
is
answerable
to
his
constituents
and
that’s
apparently
in
the
house
you
are
answerable
every
two
years.
that
is
a
pretty
tough
test
and
that
is
a
good
assurance
to
the
public
that
their
discretion
is
going
to
be
properly
exercised.
now,
as
to
the
distribution
of
the
papers,
this
is
a
report
it
is
in
the
public
domain
and
that
congress
has
a
duty
in
representing
the
people,
has
a
duty
to
inform
the
people
otherwise
how
can
the
people
can
judge
whether
the
legislator
is
doing
a
proper
job,
that
congress
is
properly
representing
him
properly
legislating
for
them.
so
that
congress
has
a
duty.
how
else
can
the
people
determine
what
additional
laws
are
needed
and
after
all
that
congressman
is
a
representative
of
the
people
and,
what
we’re
talking
about
here
and
what
consumes
me
about
some
of
the
questions
and
some
of
the
cases
that
i’ve
read
is
that
it
appears
that
there’s
an
effort
as
my
colleague
has
said
balance,
to
balance
what?
you
cannot
balance
an
individual’s
constitutional
right
in
the
context
of
the
duty
of
all
of
the
congress
to
legislate
and
the
cases
have
clearly
pointed
this
out.
let
me
refer
for
instance
the
methodist
case
which
is
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
judge
adjutant
as
chief
judge,
very
find
judge
in
which
the
court
specifically
said,
“that
the
power
to
declare
unconstitutional”
and
i
think
this
is
what
causes
a
lot
of
the
problems
in
the
thinking
of
the
judiciary.
prior
to
the
declare
law
unconstitutional
does
not
support
the
conclusion
that
they
the
court
may
sensor
language
that
they
think
is
libelous
and
i
say
to
this
court
this
is
precisely
what
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
requesting.
i
say
further
that
to
accept
their
position
would
say
would
in
effect
say
that
this
court
should
balance
the
constitutional
legislative
powers
in
its
broad
sense
not
against
one
member
as
compared
to
a
complaining
u.s.
citizen.
we’re
talking
about
the
broad
sense
when
you
are
talking
about
the
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
when
you
are
talking
about
the
contents
of
the
document,
when
you
are
talking
about
an
effort
as
these
complainants
are
attempting
to
impose
an
effort
to
sensor
because
they’re
asking
them
that
you
weigh
the
constitutional
legislative
mandate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
comes
almost
within
the
doctrine
of
the
major
case
recently
decided
relating
to
powell.
the
constitutional
mandate
for
congress
is
to
legislate
and
is
a
separation
of
past
question
when
it
is
exercised
and
within
the
legislative
act
come
at
once
that’s
determined
there
is
no
further
question.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
the
congress
does
not
and
has
not
exercise
then
i
don’t
say
it
couldn’t
if
it’s
so
fit
to
do
so
in
its
wisdom,
has
not
published
and
printed
documents
for
the
purpose
of
public
sale.
now
the
government
office
can
make
them
available
by
request
and
they
should.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
it
did
not
however
--
mr.
william
c.
cramer
it
was
consistent
with
the
act
of
congress
that
says
specific
document
shall
be
made
available
and
i
would
not
take
it
would
be
improper
for
them
to
say,
yes,
it’s
available
to
the
public.
even
though
it
is
defamatory
assuming
it’s
not
defamatory
it’s
a
resolution
authorized
by
the
--
mr.
william
c.
cramer
it
is
the
customary
congressional
numbers
that
go
to
largely
governmental
agencies
in
the
congress
itself
by
statute.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
no,
sir.
at
page
4
of
our
brief
and
let
me
close
by
saying
that
whether
the
material
in
a
report
is
wrongly
acquired,
defamatory,
erroneous
or
with
nothing
the
authority
of
anyone
as
a
result
of
that,
there
is
nothing
that
the
authority
of
anyone
has
to
prevent
congress
from
publishing
any
statements
even
if
it
is
erroneous
and
defamatory
and
that
is
methodist
federation.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
i
would
take
that’s
correct
sir.
in
hearst
v.
black
says,
let
me
close
with
this,
greeting
there’s
one
comment.
although
the
information
there
was
unconstitutionally
acquired,
this
is
the
case
in
this
instance
that
they
are
heeding
although
i
disagree
with
them
on
that
conclusion
on
the
facts.
if
it
be
insisted
that
this
is
the
acknowledgement
of
a
power
whose
plentitude
may
become
a
catechism.
the
answer
is
that
the
congress
is
as
much
a
guardian
of
liberties
and
welfare
of
the
people
as
the
courts
on
their
separation
to
power.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
yes.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
the
question
that
was
asked
was
could
congress
distribute
it?
if
congress
--
mr.
william
c.
cramer
it
did
not.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
well,
the
report
was
distributed
to
the
district
court.
there
are
some
additional
copies
made
of
evidence
such
as
to
the
library
of
congress
and
the
district
of
columbia
wants
when
it
can
go
to
the
library
to
get
it.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
so
within
the
depth
of
the
question
is,
is
it
distributed?
[voice
overlap]
mr.
william
c.
cramer
yes.
mr.
william
c.
cramer
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
