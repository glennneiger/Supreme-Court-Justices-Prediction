chief

but
the
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
was
libelous
per
se
invading
the
privacy
or
some
person
in
a
very
gross
way,
is
there
any
remedy
for
that?
chief

warren
e.
burger
[voice

interesting
on
a
right
of
privacy
claim
and
i
am
assuming
now
the
grossest
kind
of
libel
you
could
imagine
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
speech
by
a
member.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
having
to
decide
that
some
of
them
been
taken
to
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
said,
you
are
relying
on
all
the
law
that
would
be
available
to
you
if
the
--
if
these
defendants
were
private
people
such
as
defamation
law,
common
law,
statutory
law
of
defamation
plus
constitutional
claims
since
these
defendants
are
government,
the
federal
government
and
surely,
i
don’t
suppose
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
fifth
amendment
have
anything
or
whatever
to
do
as
truth
or
falsity,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
who
would
have
the
same
allegations
on
the
same
thrust
to
your
complaint
i
take
it
if
instead
of
having
the
invasion
of
privacy
that
you
claim
made
up
by
written
reports
of
the
committee,
one
of
the
members
had
made
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house
saying
using
all
of
the
same
words
revealing
all
of
the
same
information,
would
you
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
it
wasn’t
authorize,
then
recap
for
me
how
it
becomes
government
action
--
governmental
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
you
say
its
ultra
vires.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
newspaper
or
there
had
done
precisely
the
same
thing
using
the
same
conduct
then
what
would
be
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
direct
that
against
the
reporter
or
the
teacher?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
reporter
can
violate
the
constitution
by
asking
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
congress
isn’t
limited
by
gathering
useful
information
in
the
process
of
legislating,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
that
normal
process
of
inquiry
whether
you
are
preparing
for
trial
in
a
lawsuit
or
preparing
to
past
legislation?
you
get
a
great
--
you
do
a
great
deal
of
sifting
before
you
get
any
nuggets,
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
valder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
vinson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
theory
mr.
vinson,
could
the
legislative
people
involved
here
have
simply
made
no
appearance
at
all
in
the
district
court
and
stood
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause
as
a
complete
defense
even
to
having
--
even
being
required
to
put
in
an
answer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
not
be
a
courteous
thing
to
do
with
respect
to
the
district
court
but
you
say,
you
could
do
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
committee
did
not
publish
and
suppose
it
refused
public
request
of
some
newspaper
request
for
copies
of
the
report,
might
not
the
freedom
of
information
act
come
into
play?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
again
returning
to
the
freedom
of
information
act,
wasn’t
the
whole
thrust
of
that
act
to
retire
all
government
agencies
to
open
their
records
and
far
more
wildly
than
they
had
ever
done
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
thrust
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
passed
by
the
same
congress
that
we’re
now
talking
about.
i
don’t
mean
the
same
congress
by
number
but
the
same
institution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
vinson.
mr.
cramer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
this
court
decided
the
question
of
prior
restraints
and
the
rule
held
that
it
was
irrelevant
how
the
information
was
acquired
and
what
is
called
the
pentagon
papers
case,
did
we
not?
chief

e.

you
mr.

mr.

chief

you,

mr.

you
have
about
five
minutes
left.
chief

well,
if

document
was
in
the
library
of
congress,
wasn’t
it
available
to
every
newspaper,
the
one
we
got?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
is
it
illegal
for
it
to
be
delivered
to
the
library
of
congress?
chief

e.

you

the
