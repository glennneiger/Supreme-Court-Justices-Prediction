mr.
david
p.
sutton
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
several
copies
in
our
office.
where
they
come
from
specifically,
i
don’t
know
but
we
were
furnished
with
copies.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
district
of
columbia
respondents
consisting
of
the
members
of
the
board
of
education,
the
superintendent
of
schools,
a
junior
high
school
principal,
and
a
junior
high
school
teacher.
our
position
is
that
simply
stated
that
that
the
doctorate
official
immunity
as
interpreted
and
applied
by
this
court
and
barr
versus
matteo
and
howard
versus
lyons,
and
companion
case
forecloses
the
liability.
we
like
to
take
these
respondents
individually.
first,
we’d
like
to
take
the
board
members
and
the
superintendent
of
schools.
the
gravamen
of
petition
in
this
case
as
to
these
respondents
is
that
they
should
respond
to
damages.
the
failures
would
promulgate
regulations
governing
the
confidentiality
of
school
documents
really
and
they
did.
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
this
is
of
course
our
legislative
function
to
top
level
function
is
clearly
within
the
framework
of
barr
versus
matteo
and
it
is
not
remediable
in
damages.
the
teacher
and
the
principal
perhaps
taken
on
a
different
light,
in
regard
to
their
liability
or
alleged
liability
we
emphasize
at
the
very
outset
that
unlike
the
barr
versus
matteo
case.
this
case
in
the
context
of
the
principal
and
teacher
involves
an
intergovernmental
dissemination
or
communication,
a
communication
within
the
framework
of
the
government
itself.
let
me
illustrate
that
with
the
comparison.
let’s
assume
that
instead
of
giving
this
directly
to
congressional
committee,
the
principal
and
teacher
gave
the
data
to
the
school
board
and
the
school
board
in
turn
published
it.
perhaps
there
might
be
an
action
to
damages
against
the
school
board
but
not
against
the
principal
and
teacher
for
giving
the
information.
we
submit
that
congress,
vis-à-vis
the
district
of
columbia
school
system
may
be
fairly
viewed
as
a
supervisory
or
senior
school
board,
and
as
a
kind
of
employer,
it
has
plenary
power
to
investigate
the
school
system
that
controls
its
purse
strings,
it
certainly
may
be
analogize
with
the
top
level
employer.
it
is
within
the
periphery
then
of
an
employer-employee
relationship
that
this
information
was
tended
with
some
of
its
absolutely
privileged
even
applying
the
standards
articulated
by
then
chief
justice
warren
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
barr
versus
matteo.
and
we
also
emphasized
that
petitioners
do
not
question
the
right
of
these
officials
to
give
the
information.
well
its
officials
we
would
refer
the
court
to
pages
35
and
37
of
the
appendix.
i
am
not
going
to
quote
chapter
and
verse
but
they
emphasized
that
the
trial
court,
we
don’t
question
the
right
of
congress
to
get
this
information.
we
don’t
question
the
right
of
teachers
to
give
it.
as
petitioners
said
almost
rebellion,
they
can’t
go
into
schools;
they
can’t
talk
to
people
as
they
did.
about
that
we
did
not
quibble.
what
we
complain
about
is
the
reproduction
and
the
insertion
of
names
while
the
insertion
of
names
it
so
happens
took
place
12
hearings
later.
six
months
later.
the
information
was
given
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
believe
we
do
to
some
extent
your
honor
because
the
report
contains
a
verbatim
interviews
conducting
with
many
local
school
officials,
many
principals
and
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no.
we
know
that
what
petitioners
alleged
and
what
the
report
shows
that
there
was
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
we
do
in
the
sense
that
we
know
that
congress
is
the
ultimate
superior.
we
know
that
the
principal
is
a
subordinate
of
that
superior.
we
also
know
that
interviews
took
place
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
because
it
is
clear
from
the
record
as
to
what
did
actually
happen.
if
what
happened
was
as
alleged
by
petitioners,
we
would
say
it
is
another
law
the
doctrine
of
official
immunity
applies
that
we
have
a
kind
of
employer-employee
relationship
here
that
under
the
applicable
decisional
law
that
this
gives
rise
to
an
absolute
privilege
and
we
also
had
the
reported
evidence
which
shows
that
there
are
many
interviews.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
well,
the
principal
turned
it
over
because
he
was
called
by
investigator
of
the
congressional
committee
to
do
so.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
as
investigator.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
it’s
alleged
in
the
complaint,
your
honor
that
i
think
it’s
fairly
inferable
from
the
complaint
and
the
record
that
the
investigator
was
acting
in
the
committee’s
behalf.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
the
hearing
certainly
would
have
been
better
but
our
position
is
it
does
not
legally
require
it.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
in
a
few
moments
i
have
left
the
proposition
that
the
civil
rights
act
does
not
offer
the
immunity
of
the
district
of
columbia
respondents.
under
the
civil
rights
act,
petitioners
urged
that
the
civil
rights
act
should
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia
respondents
because
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
state.
first
of
all,
that
question
is
pending
before
this
court
and
his
d.c.
versus
carter.
petitioners
rely
essentially
upon
the
statement
by
judge
wright
dissenting
it
should
be
noted
that
the
courts
have
consistently
held
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
state
of
territory
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
cf.
hurd
versus
hodge.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
that
clear,
it
is
now
pending
before
this
court
that
the
court
has
request
a
supplemental
memorandum.
we
would
also
submit
that
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
have
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
legislate
the
district
of
columbia.
we
have
congress
vis-a-vis
the
school
system
as
a
supervisory
school
board.
under
the
circumstances,
we
submit
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
apply
barr
versus
matteo
standard
to
the
(inaudible)
federal
employees,
get
a
civil
rights
act
standard
to
the
district
of
columbia
employees.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no,
in
the
technical
sense
standout
your
honor
but
in
the
general
sense
they
are.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
we
don’t
urge
they
are
covered
by
gravel.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no,
we
wouldn’t
go
that
far.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
we
would
also
have
the
size
and
even
assuming
the
civil
rights
act
does
apply
in
this
case.
then
the
question
would
be
prior
to
dimensions
of
the
immunity
doctrine
under
that
act.
now
this
court
has
not
yet
articulated
the
dimensions
but
lower
federal
courts
have
and
we
can
take
standards
articulated
by
lower
courts.
we
can
weigh
competing
interests
certainly
and
we
can
come
up
with
an
equitable
result.
now,
it
seems
that,
in
one
of
the
spectrum
you
have
the
right
of
the
congress
to
receive
information.
if
there
are
another
spectrum
you
have
the
right
to
privacy.
but
the
right
of
privacy
is
alleged
to
have
been
violated
here,
not
in
the
context
of
the
right
of
congress
to
receive
information
but
in
the
context
of
publication
of
information.
so
here
again,
it’s
a
question
of
complete
good
faith
as
conceded
by
the
petitioners
and
though
the
federal
courts
do
hold
that
if
this
good
faith
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
does
not
alter
the
immunity
of
the
government,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
fairly
applicable
here.
well,
another
analogy
that
i
would
like
to
make
it
seems
that
there
was
a
companion
case
to
barr
versus
matteo
and
that
was
called
howard
versus
lyons,
that
companion
case
involves
the
commander
of
a
boston
naval
shipyard.
it
so
happen
that
the
commander
of
the
shipyard
made
a
press
release,
gathered
information
to
congress.
the
information
was
not
requested.
it
was
delivered
unsolicitedly
by
the
shipyard
commander
and
who
it
was
given
up
to
a
congressional
committee
but
to
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation.
we
submit
that
that
case
would
indicate
that
the
rules
of
the
immunity
doctrines
as
a
fortiori
applicable
here
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
principal
may
fairly
be
analogized
as
we
say
it
to
the
commander
of
shipyard.
he
has
extensive
duties
within
the
periphery
of
the
school
system.
secondly,
and
we
emphasize
this,
we
don’t
have
an
unsolicited
inquiry
or
unsolicited
response
to
a
congressional
delegation.
we
have
a
solicited
response
by
a
committee
of
the
congress.
that
leaves
only
to
teacher,
as
we
see
it.
now,
the
teacher
we
don’t
find
analogies
with
any
prior
decision
of
this
court
we
admit,
neither
with
the
barr
decision
nor
the
howard
decision.
but
it’s
not
without
significance,
it
seems
barr
was
decided
and
before
barr
was
decided,
many
lower
federal
courts
have
applied
the
immunity
doctrine
to
(inaudible)
line
officials
comparable
a
nature
of
position
to
the
teacher.
personnel
officers,
game
wardens,
treasury
agents,
we
submit
that
those
authorities
well,
obviously
not
a
binding
on
this
court
are
persuasive.
so
in
all
respects,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
apply
the
doctrine
of
official
immunity
to
the
district
of
columbia
respondents
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
several
copies
in
our

where
they
come

i
don’t

mr.

mr.

may

i
represent

columbia
respondents
consisting
of
the
members
of
the
board
of
education,
the
superintendent
of
schools,
a
junior
high
school
principal,
and
a
junior
high
school
teacher.
our
position
is
that
simply
stated
that
that
the
doctorate
official
immunity
as
interpreted
and
applied
by
this
court
and
barr
versus
matteo
and
howard
versus
lyons,
and
companion
case
forecloses
the
liability.
we
like
to
take
these
respondents
individually.
first,
we’d
like
to
take
the
board
members
and
the
superintendent
of
schools.
the
gravamen
of
petition
in
this
case
as
to

is
that
they
should

the

would

they

we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
this
is

our
legislative
function
to
top
level
function
is
clearly
within
the
framework
of
barr

matteo
and
it
is
not
remediable
in
damages.
the
teacher
and
the
principal
perhaps
taken
on
a
different
light,
in
regard
to
their
liability
or
alleged
liability
we
emphasize
at
the
very
outset
that
unlike
the
barr

case.
this

in
the

of
the

let’s

that

the

gave

to
the

and
the

perhaps
there
might
be
an
action
to
damages
against
the
school
board
but
not
against
the

for
giving
the
information.
we
submit
that

and
we
also
emphasized
that
petitioners
do

well
its

of

the

was
given
--
mr.
david

sutton
i
believe
we
do
to
some
extent
your
honor
because
the
report
contains
a
verbatim
interviews
conducting
with
many
local
school
officials,
many
principals
and
--
mr.

no,
your

there
was
no

mr.
david
p.

no.
we
know
that
what
petitioners
alleged
and
what
the

shows
that
there
was
--
mr.

sutton
we
do
in
the

that
we

we

is

we
also
know
that
interviews
took
place
--
mr.
david

sutton
because
it
is
clear
from
the

also
had
the

which
shows
that

mr.
david
p.
sutton
well,
the
principal
turned
it
over
because
he
was
called
by
investigator
of
the
congressional
committee
to
do
so.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
as
investigator.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
it’s
alleged
in
the
complaint,
your
honor
that
i
think
it’s
fairly
inferable
from
the
complaint
and
the
record
that
the
investigator
was
acting
in

mr.
david

the

certainly
would

assuming
the
civil
rights
act
does
apply
in
this
case.
then
the
question
would
be
prior
to
dimensions
of
the
immunity
doctrine
under
that
act.
now
this
court
has
not
yet
articulated
the
dimensions
but
lower
federal
courts
have
and
we
can
take
standards
articulated
by
lower
courts.
we
can
weigh
competing
interests
certainly
and
we
can
come
up
with
an
equitable
result.
now,
it
seems
that,
in
one
of
the
spectrum
you
have
the
right
of
the
congress
to
receive
information.
if
there
are
another
spectrum
you
have
the
right
to
privacy.
but
the
right
of
privacy
is
alleged
to
have
been
violated
here,
not
in
the
context
of
the
right
of
congress
to
receive
information
but
in
the
context
of
publication
of
information.
so
here
again,
it’s
a
question
of
complete
good
faith
as
conceded
by
the
petitioners
and
though
the
federal
courts
do
hold
that
if
this
good
faith
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
does
not
alter
the
immunity
of
the
government,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
fairly
applicable
here.
well,
another
analogy
that
i
would
like
to
make
it
seems
that
there
was
a
companion
case
to
barr
versus
matteo
and
that
was
called
howard
versus
lyons,
that
companion
case
involves
the
commander
of
a
boston
naval
shipyard.
it
so
happen
that
the
commander
of
the
shipyard
made
a
press
release,
gathered
information
to
congress.
the
information
was
not
requested.
it
was
delivered
unsolicitedly
by
the
shipyard
commander
and
who
it
was
given
up
to
a
congressional
committee
but
to
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation.
we
submit
that
that
case
would
indicate
that
the
rules
of
the
immunity
doctrines
as
a
fortiori
applicable
here
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
principal
may
fairly
be
analogized
as
we
say
it
to
the
commander
of
shipyard.
he
has
extensive
duties
within
the
periphery
of
the
school
system.
secondly,
and
we
emphasize
this,
we
don’t
have
an
unsolicited
inquiry
or
unsolicited
response
to
a
congressional
delegation.
we
have
a
solicited
response
by
a
committee
of
the
congress.
that
leaves
only
to
teacher,
as
we
see
it.
now,
the
teacher
we
don’t
find
analogies
with
any
prior
decision
of
this
court
we
admit,
neither
with
the
barr
decision
nor
the
howard
decision.
but
it’s
not
without
significance,
it
seems
barr
was
decided
and
before
barr
was
decided,
many
lower
federal
courts
have
applied
the
immunity
doctrine
to
(inaudible)
line
officials
comparable
a
nature
of
position
to
the
teacher.
personnel
officers,
game
wardens,
treasury
agents,
we
submit
that
those
authorities
well,
obviously
not
a
binding
on
this
court
are
persuasive.
so
in
all
respects,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
apply
the
doctrine
of
official
immunity
to
the
district
of
columbia
respondents
in
this
case.
thank
you.
