justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
say
the
congress
publishes
report,
it
could
be
stopped?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
certainly,
you
don’t
have
to
go
that
far
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
we
preclude
it
from
getting
into?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
that
way
you
take
the
sizes
the
wrong
direction,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
barr
against
matteo
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
district
of
columbia.
it’s
a
federal
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
matteo
is
as
to
immunity
of
federal
officials
in
alaska,
hawaii,
and
the
other
48
states
and
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
i
don’t
see
how
we
can
be
bound
by
an
interpretation
of
barr-matteo
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
i
don’t
think
it’s
binding
on
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
binding
on
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
it
be
possible
for
us
to
agree
with
you
without
considering
the
carter
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
my
only
point.
why
did
you
work
on
only
one
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
vinson,
what
about
this
charge
if
this
is
outside
of
the
scope?
all
of
this,
is
that
outside
the
scope
of
the
committee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
first
of
all,
does
it
matter
if
it’s
published
by
the
committee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
know
how
the
--
we’ve
gotten,
do
we?
we
don’t
know
what
we
said
at
all,
do
we
between
the
policeman
and
the
principal
and
the
teacher?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
was
no
hearing
on
it,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don’t
actually
know,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
know
that
principal
has
turned
it
over
to
his
superior,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i’m
just
emphasizing
what
judge
wright
said
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
things
like
this
should
have
a
hearing
to
find
out
whether
barr-matteo
applies
a
lot
and
the
only
way
to
find
that
is
what
actually
happened.
now,
why
do
you
object
to
such
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
then
the
evidence
that
showed
why
the
principal
turned
it
over?
nothing.
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
hem,
as
in
a
congressional
investigator
or
as
a
policeman
or
as
an
individual?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
i
granted
further,
my
only
point
is
that
the
hearing
would
straighten
this
all
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
the
district
of
columbia
board
of
education
employees
of
congress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
i
say
if
they
are
and
they
are
covered
by
gravel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
just
wondered
how
far
you’re
going?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
