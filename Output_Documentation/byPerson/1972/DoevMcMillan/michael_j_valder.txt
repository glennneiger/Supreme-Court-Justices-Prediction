mr.
michael
j.
valder
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
michael
valder.
with
me
are
mrs.
jean
camper
cahn
and
mr.
dan
bowling.
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners,
we
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
lower
courts
and
to
remand
this
cause
for
consideration
of
preliminary
injunctive
relief
and
trial
on
the
merits.
but
more
important,
than
a
reversal
and
remand,
is
our
request
that
you
declare
the
law
which
will
govern
this
case.
the
issues
presented
compel,
we
believe,
several
declarations
by
this
court.
first
and
perhaps,
more
importantly
is
the
declaration
that
the
federal
courts
are
open
for
the
business
of
adjudicating
petitioners
claims
based
on
the
constitution
and
the
civil
rights
laws
of
the
united
states.
secondly,
a
declaration
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
protects
no
one,
congressman
included
from
defending
a
suit
for
violation
of
constitutional
rights
to
privacy.
the
decision
in
the
gravel
case
we
believe
indicates
that
speech
or
debate
clause
immunity
extends
only
to
valid
legislative
acts.
gravel
expressly
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
the
cases
don’t
indicate
so,
your
honor.
we’re
not
faced
with
that
here
however.
here
it
is
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
suspect
that
that
case
would
be
taken
to
court
and
this
court
would
be
asked.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
believe
so
your
honor
and
the
speeches
on
the
floor
have
been
held
to
be
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
but
here
as
in
gravel,
we’re
dealing
with
activity
not
on
the
floor.
we
are
dealing
with
subsidiary
activity
in
committee
by
committee
staff,
by
investigators
and
it
seems
to
us
that,
your
teaching
in
gravel
that
invasions
of
citizen
privacy
or
illegal
or
unconstitutional
actions
by
legislators
or
their
staff
are
not
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
i
believe
the
technical
language
in
your
decision
in
gravel
in
mr.
justice
white’s
decision
was
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
should
not
be
extended
to
protect
the
illegal
or
unconstitutional
actions
beyond
those
which
would
prevent
executive
control
of
legislative
speech
debate
or
legislative
activity.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
their
constitutional
right
to
privacy.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
absolutely,
your
honor
that
they
were
inaccurate.
we
never
had
a
chance
to
correct
those
inaccuracies.
we
never
had
noticed
that
this
publication
was
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
they
are
libelous,
they
are
invasions
of
privacy.
they
are
violations
of
constitutional
civil
rights
protected
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
right.
all
of
the
allegations
we
would
make
if
the
respondents
were
private
persons
are
being
made
plus
additional
claims
and
that
is
that
the
deprivations
here
were
by
and
under
color
of
governmental
authority
and
that
the
bill
of
rights
as
a
protection
against
governmental
access.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
no,
your
honor
no.
the
statements
could
be
true.
it
is
still
a
violation
of
human
rights.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
i
believe
we
could
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
the
common
law
right
of
privacy
is
a
private
tort.
the
manners
disclosed
can
be
true,
they
can
be
false.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
think
we
are
in
the
law
of
privacy
where
even
if
true
there
are
areas
of
our
lives
as
citizens
where
others
cannot
disrupt
or
destroy
or
breach
that
privacy,
you
get
into
the
additional
sanction
of
libel
and
slander
if
the
statements
are
false.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
believe
the
griswold
case
in
mr.
justice
douglas’
opinions
and
other
opinions
in
griswold
constitute
a
clear
majority
of
the
court
at
that
time
perhaps
even
of
this
court
that
there
is
a
constitutional
underpinning
for
the
right
of
privacy,
independently
of
truth
or
falsity
that
there
is
a
private
sphere
it
was
known
at
common
law
and
the
constitution
included
that
within
the
special
protections
of
the
constitution
so
it
is
private
common
law
tort
plus
it
is
constitutional.
and
here
if
there’s
still
a
third-degree
of
liability
and
that
is
the
whole
doctrine
of
governmental
access
that
the
constitution
protect
citizens
more
against
governmental
access
than
excesses
are
overreaching
by
private
parties
and
that
of
course
brings
us
to
you
that
is
we
submit
your
role,
your
special
and
peculiar
role
in
this
case
because
it
is
the
government
which
is
responding
in
its
officials.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
believe
we
would
bring
that
suit
your
honor.
we
would
bring
it
against
his
aides
or
his
staff
who
procured
the
information
assuming
it
was
procured
in
the
way
this
information
was
procured
which
was
as
alleged
surreptitiously
and
clandestinely,
and
we
don’t
know
what
else
because
we
were
thrown
out
of
court
without
a
chance
of
discovery.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
yes,
i
see
it.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
correct.
also,
we
are
in
the
deep,
deep
privacy
area
no
public
figure
possibilities
or
implications
here
whatsoever
and
also
it
is
the
question
here
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
never
authorized
by
the
congress.
never
authorize.
yes,
an
investigation
was
authorized
and
we
can
see
that
but
the
investigation
resolution
clearly
spelled
out
how
information
was
to
be
procured
and
that
is
adherence.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
right.
it’s
governmental
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
it
--
what
was
done
the
manner
and
method
of
procuring
and
compiling
this
information
and
putting
it
in
a
report
was
totally
outside
the
house
rules
and
the
committee
n
the
district
of
columbia.
those
rules
have
safeguards
which
provide
minimal
due
process
protections.
none
of
them
applied
here.
the
information
was
obtained
by
an
investigator
and
a
consultant
to
the
committee
from
teachers
--
from
a
teacher
and
a
principal.
so
the
obtaining
of
the
information
was
not
--
the
method
was
not
authorized
in
the
resolution
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
incorporated
into
a
report.
this
information
was
not
run
into
a
record
through
a
hearing.
there
were
several
days
of
hearings
in
this
law,
in
this
investigation
but
none
of
them
dealt
with
this
information.
this
information
we’ve
called
it
hip
pocket
information
came
in
by
an
investigator
to
a
consultant
and
put
it
in
a
report.
the
committee
never
passed
on
the
report.
it
was
merely
sent
to
the
speaker
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
with
the
request
that
it
be
printed.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
to
the
extent
that
we
know
your
honor
and
of
course
to
spend
no
discovery.
we
have
alleged
that
the
information
was
obtained
by
a
district
of
columbia
police
officer
on
loan
to
the
campbell
hill
police
in
turn
on
loan
to
the
house
committee
as
an
investigator
by
what
authority
he
went
about
to
schools
whether
he
used
his
district
of
columbia
police
credentials
or
his
capital
police
credentials
or
was
merely
an
independent
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
we
alleged
that
he
engaged
than
unconstitutional
conduct
because
he
participated
in
a
breach
of
the
privacy.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
not
a
criminal
statute,
i
don’t
believe.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
our
position
would
be
that
it
was
a
breach
of
his
right
--
constitutional
right
of
privacy
and
common
law
tort,
breach
of
teacher-pupil
privileged
all
of
which
would
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
against
both,
the
teacher
because
the
teacher
violated
the
rules
and
the
constitution
by
disclosing
information
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
think
he
certainly
can.
most
reporters
get
away
with
it
but
if
it
is
a
breach
of
privacy
which
is
protected
a
cause
of
action
lies
for
that
breach.
now
most
information
is
given
to
reporters
mostly
by
those
who
have
the
complete
interest
in
the
information.
here
the
students
had
an
interest
and
they
were
never
consulted.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
one
of
the
cases
which
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
as
i
recall
was
a
case
by
a
private
citizen
who
was
in
an
accident
and
was
photographed
evidently
in
some
disarray,
a
lady
and
she
successfully
maintained
an
action
for
breach
of
privacy
against
the
newspaper
photographer
who
took
her
picture
in
the
newspaper
who
published
it.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
positive
yes.
now,
returning
for
a
moment
to
the
gravel
decision
as
we
understand
that
case
their
can
be
speech
or
debate
immunity
for
valid
legislative
acts
and
our
position
is
that
what
was
done
here
was
not
valid
legislative
act.
it
was
unauthorized.
the
method
used
was
contrary
to
house
rules
and
contrary
to
procedural
due
process
requirements
and
it
was
contrary
to
committee
rules
in
the
way
in
which
the
committee
report
was
processed
and
printed.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
valid
legislative
act.
the
bill
of
attainder
clause
speaks
to
a
limitation
on
speech
or
debate
immunity.
the
bill
of
attainder
provision
of
the
constitution
is
internal
evidence
within
the
constitution
itself
that
congressional
action
will
not
always
escape
judicial
scrutiny
so
that
if
it
is
a
valid
legislative
act
it
begins
to
partake
of
the
bill
of
attainder
and
if
it’s
not
a
valid
legislative
act
there
is
no
speech
or
debate
immunity.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
we
believe
it
can
be.
it
has
been
temporarily
stopped.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
actually
we
don’t
want
to
report
stuck,
your
honor.
we
want
the
students’
names
exhaust.
it
can
serve
no
valid
legislative
purpose
whatsoever
to
contain
the
students
and
their
parents’
names.
we
concede
that
every
ounce
of
information
in
that
report
may
be
relevant
and
serve
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
but
what
purpose
is
served
by
putting
the
names
of
12,
13
and
14
year-old
students
in
that
kind
of
a
report.
the
only
justification
offered
in
the
lower
court
was
a
terse
statement
that
the
names
lent
credibility.
while
we
submit
that
credibility
used
in
that
context
really
means
the
interest
that
a
gossiper
has
in
knowing
who
is
the
subject
of
gossip.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
if
it
may
and
it
may
not
have
served
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
we’re
not
challenging
that.
some
of
that
information
may
be
valid
and
useful
other
of
it
may
not
be
at
all.
we
don’t
really
care.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
probably
most
of
the
information
that
get
turns
out
to
be
not
useful.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
true.
what
i
was
focusing
on
is
the
barenblatt-watkins
really
line
of
cases
where
without
authorization
and
with
no
legislative
purpose
whatsoever
this
court
has
said
the
federal
judiciary
may
inquire
into
what’s
going
on
in
congress
and
that
was
the
focus.
here,
no
authorization
to
get
the
names
and
published
them.
no
ostensible
or
apparent
legislative
purpose.
in
fact
contrariwise,
the
constitutional
proscription
of
violating
privacy
would
indicate
that
those
names
shouldn’t
be
there.
affirmatively
that
they
should
not
be
there
not
just
negatively
that
there
is
no
need
to
put
them
there.
now,
i
might
say
that
we
are
also
requesting
a
declaration
that
the
bivens
doctrine.
bivens
versus
six
unknown
federal
narcotics
agents
creates
an
independent
cause
of
action
against
the
federal
respondents
here.
those
respondents
acting
under
color
of
federal
law,
we
submit
are
suable
and
a
cause
of
action
lies
against
them
under
the
1971
doctrine
in
bivens.
just
as
against
the
district
of
columbia
respondents,
there
is
an
independent
cause
of
action
under
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
that’s
section
1983
of
title
42
that
1983
severely
limited
the
immunity
available
to
local
officials.
now,
i
wanted
to
mention
that
we
are
aware
of
the
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
case
which
was
argued
before
you
about
five
weeks
ago.
it
is
significant
that
in
that
case
the
district
of
columbia
government
did
not
bring
to
this
court
the
issue
of
official
immunity
which
was
decided
against
the
district
of
columbia
by
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals.
the
only
issue
brought
to
you
in
that
case
was
whether
the
district
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
as
noted
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
our
case,
the
carter
decision
which
have
been
decided
before
the
doe
case
was
decided,
clearly
ruled
on
the
question
of
immunity.
however,
the
majority
opinion
below
did
not
even
mention
the
carter
case.
it
was
discussed
at
length
in
the
dissenting
opinion
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
extent
and
degree
and
scope
of
official
immunity
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
been
refined
and
honed
to
a
very
sharp
edge
in
a
series
of
decisions
beginning
with
spencer,
elden
and
leading
up
to
and
including
the
carter
decision,
and
that
the
method
of
adjudicating
official
immunity
questions
has
been
set.
the
district
of
columbia
has
not
appealed
that
method
of
adjudicating
official
immunity
claims.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
correct.
under
1983,
we
assert
a
claim
against
the
teacher,
the
principal,
the
superintendent
and
the
board
of
education.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
we
are
asserting
claims
against
the
congressman
himself,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
believe
judge
wright’s
opinion
makes
clear
that
he
was
so
much
more
concerned
about
the
sweeping
grant
of
authority
to
committee
aides
that
he
took
that
question
of
and
dealt
with
it.
now
as
you
may
recall
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
our
position
is
that
certainly
as
to
injunctive
relief
the
federal
courts
have
the
power
in
appropriate
cases
to
enjoin
a
congressional
report
that
would
be
relief
directed
against
congressmen.
now
the
question
of
damages
is
stickier
but
we
believe
that
we
can
reach
the
congressman
respondents
on
the
question
of
damages
upon
showing
that
they
participated
in
a
violation
of
our
constitutional
rights
that
as
said
in
united
states
versus
lee,
“no
man
is
above
the
law,
no
one
is”
and
if
that
means
that
you
must
exercise
your
most
supreme
power
to
touch
the
congressmen,
we
submit
it
must
be
dark.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
it
would
ask
to
the
official
immunity
doctrine,
your
honor.
let
me
recapitulate.
there
are
two
doctrines
of
immunity
operating
for
the
federal
respondents
the
speech
or
debate
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
no,
it
didn’t
but
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
courts
have
in
the
past
10
years
done
a
tremendous
amount
in
several
cases
of
expansion,
contraction
and
redefining
how
the
barr
doctrine
is
applied
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
no,
you’re
not.
but
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
bound
by
its
earlier
opinions
in
this
area
and
that
it
did
not
follow
them
under
principles
of
stare
decisis
that
court,
a
different
panel
of
that
court
had
just
decided
carter,
comes
doe
versus
mcmillan,
they
don’t
even
cite
it.
they
disregard
it
and
they
ruled
contrary
to
it
and
we
are
suggesting
that
you
need
not
reach
the
barr
versus
matteo
question.
you
need
only
declare
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
stare
decisis
principles
operate.
the
doctrine
as
it
has
been
announced
and
defined,
and
is
operating
should
be
applied
in
this
case
the
same
as
in
any
other
case.
we
did
not
ask
you
to
rule
on
the
barr
versus
matteo
doctrine.
we
merely
want
the
court
of
appeals
to
follow
stare
decisis
principles
which
we
believe
our
binding
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
they
did
not
appeal
that
question
in
the
carter
case.
now
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
certainly
i
don’
think
you
are
precluded
if
you
care
to.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
it
is
our
belief
that
barr
versus
matteo
should
be
applied
perhaps
throughout
the
country
as
it
is
in
the
district
of
columbia
under
that
line
of
cases.
but
it
is
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
right.
as
to
how
person
sued
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
federal
court.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
no,
your
honor
it
is
not
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
if
i
may,
your
honor.
in
the
line
of
cases
in
the
district
the
doctrine
of
barr
was
not
played
around
with.
it
was
the
way
in
which
the
courts
in
the
city
must
apply
it
and
that
is
they
might
take
a
look
at
the
case.
they
must
take
a
close
look
at
the
precise
governmental
function
at
issue.
what
the
carter’
case
stands
for
is
you
can’t
throw
out
the
case
the
day
it’s
filed.
the
judge
has
an
important
role
to
play.
he
has
to
look
at
the
function.
is
it
discretionary?
would
it
inhibit
the
proper
exercise
of
the
government
to
hold
this
official
liable
for
the
performance
of
this
function?
that
was
the
point
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
it
was
not
proper
to
throw
this
case
out
on
the
very
day
it
was
filed
without
any
responsive
pleading.
without
any
chance
to
take
a
good
look
at
the
function
at
issue.
now
that’s
the
modification
of
district
of
columbia.
it
did
not
throw
out
barr
versus
matteo
that’s
still
absolutely
the
law.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
it
would
be
possible
by
simply
saying
that
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
your
honors,
i
flashed
on
my
time.
i
would
like
to
save
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal
if
it’s
possible.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
thank
you.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
it
is
our
understanding
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
before
disclosure
of
this
kind
of
information
is
permitted
authorized
or
required
into
the
act
that
names
of
private
citizens
must
be
excised.
i
consulted
with
the
counsel
and
it
is
our
understanding
we
do
not
have
a
copy
of
this
statute
with
us
but
that
is
our
understanding
the
same
congress
or
the
same
institution
is
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
if
the
freedom
of
information
act
were
applying
to
this
information,
i
understood
that
to
be
the
court’s
question.
what
would
be
the
standards
and
we
understand
the
standards
to
require
excision
of
the
names.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
your
may
be
right,
your
honor.
i
think
the
point
is
that
the
congress
showed
a
sensitivity
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
that
question
and
that
there
is
a
way
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
privacy
or
in
anonymity.
secondly,
it
is
our
understanding
that
the
distribution
of
this
report
was
virtually
unlimited.
we
called
and
got
copies.
we,
i
don’t
how
many
copies
we
have
and
mr.
sutton
says
that
they
have
copies.
i
believe
our
clients
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
called
the
committee.
come
down
and
get
some
copies.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
on
the
pleading.
it
went
off
the
day
our
complaint
was
filed.
there
wasn’t
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i’m
not
sure
of
whether
it
was
in
the
complaint.
i
am
quite
sure
that
in
the
arguments
that
day
on
the
motion
for
tro
there
was
some
discussion
that
it
was,
it
was
becoming
circulated.
there
was
newspaper
coverage.
i
believe
that
the
local
washington
stations
had
stories.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
your
honor,
i
am
referred
to
paragraph
15
in
our
complaint
on
information
and
belief
unless
we
strained
defendants
will
continue
to
distribute
and
publish
information
concerning
plaintiffs,
their
children,
and
other
students,
etcetera.
i’m
not
sure
that’s
as
good
an
allegation
as
might
have
been
made.
but
i
believe
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
case
in
the
one
day
it
was
in
district
court.
that
it
was
being
distributed,
that’s
why
we
went
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
the
next
point
i’d
like
to
make,
your
honor
is
that
the
district
of
columbia
respondents
are
in
error
when
they
claim
in
their
brief
and
as
mr.
sutton
did
in
his
argument
that
we
made
a
concession
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
okay.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
thank
you.
the
concession
is
important
because
it’s
a
fundamental
argument
made
by
the
respondents
in
the
district
of
columbia
respondents.
the
only
concession
that
was
made,
was
made
by
counsel
at
the
hearing
before
judge
sirica,
when
he
said
that
he
did
not
complain
about
the
fact
that
investigators
talked
to
the
teacher
and
the
principal,
period.
he
did
not
concede
that
the
teacher
and
the
principal
had
a
right
to
give
this
information
--
these
documents
to
the
investigators
and
that
is
pertinent
distinction.
talk?
yes.
disclosure
and
passing
of
documents
with
names?
no.
there
wasn’t
such
concession
on.
i’m
sorry
if
there’s
been
some
confusion
on
that.
but
i
--
and
what’s
more
even
if
there
had
been
that
kind
of
that
of
a
concession.
we
submit
that
the
procedures
in
the
district
court
were
highly
irregular.
we
went
to
court
at
04:30,
the
day
the
complaint
was
filed
on
our
motion
for
at
temporary
restraining
order
to
be
met
by
a
sua
sponte
dismissal
on
the
merits
with
the
judge
asserting
he
thought
it
was
frivolous.
we
had
no
idea,
we
were
to
defend
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
summary
judgment
that
no
one
had
made.
and
even
if
there
may
have
been
a
concession,
we
don’t
think
that
it
is
a
real
concession
but
there
was
no
concession
on
this
teacher
and
principal
giving
the
documents
and
i
think
you
may
have
to
read
the
transcript
of
the
argument.
another
point
is
that,
we
submit
that
as
to
the
district
court
of
columbia
respondents,
congress
is
not
the
ultimate
superior.
the
law
is
the
ultimate
superior
of
public
officials
and
because
of
the
peculiar
relationship
in
this
city
between
public
officials
and
the
house
district
committee,
it
is
tempting
to
say
that
the
house
committee
is
the
government
but
it
is
not.
the
real
government
in
this
city
is
the
law
and
teachers,
principals,
boards
of
education,
congressman’s
staff
and
investigators
have
to
comply
with
the
law
and
that
is
the
ultimate
superior
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
we
think
that
the
processes
of
the
law
and
that
the
protections
of
the
constitution
and
the
protections
of
a
civil
rights
act
now
a
101
years
old
provide
us
with
the
remedy
and
that
an
injunction
is
possible
if
only
the
courthouse
doors
will
open.
they’ve
been
close
to
us
this
is
the
last
court
we
can
go
to.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
am
sorry
it
is
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
which
incidentally
was
passed
about
two
months
after
a
bill
creating
a
territorial
government
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
is
the
reference
to
the
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
supplemental
memorandum.
we
adopt
that
position.
finally,
your
honors,
these
children
have
been
hurt
and
they
will
continue
to
be
hurt.
for
this
to
follow
them
throughout
their
lives
is
we
think
unpardonable
and
must
be
remedied.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
it
certainly
was,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
your
honor,
it
is
water
over
the
dam.
it
should
have
never
been
published
with
their
names.
having
been
published
we
want
an
injunction
that
further
distribution
excise
their
names
into
the
practical
extent
possible
the
report
be
recalled
with
the
names
excised.
that
is
limited
injunctive
relief;
it
is
not
broad
and
sweepy.
my
time
is
up.
we
submit.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
michael
valder.
with
me
are
mrs.
jean
camper
cahn
and
mr.
dan
bowling.
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners,
we
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
lower
courts
and
to
remand
this
cause
for
consideration
of
preliminary
injunctive
relief
and
trial
on
the
merits.
but
more
important,
than
a
reversal
and
remand,
is
our
request
that
you
declare
the
law
which
will
govern
this
case.
the
issues
presented
compel,
we
believe,
several
declarations
by
this
court.
first
and
perhaps,
more
importantly
is
the
declaration
that
the
federal
courts
are
open
for
the
business
of
adjudicating
petitioners
claims
based
on
the
constitution
and
the
civil
rights
laws
of
the
united
states.
secondly,
a
declaration
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
protects
no
one,
congressman
included
from
defending
a
suit
for
violation
of
constitutional
rights
to
privacy.
the
decision
in
the
gravel
case
we
believe
indicates
that
speech
or
debate
clause
immunity
extends
only
to
valid
legislative
acts.
gravel
expressly
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
the
cases
don’t
indicate
so,
your
honor.
we’re
not
faced
with
that
here
however.
here
it
is
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
suspect
that
that
case
would
be
taken
to
court
and
this
court
would
be
asked.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
believe
so
your
honor
and
the
speeches
on
the
floor
have
been
held
to
be
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
but
here
as
in
gravel,
we’re
dealing
with
activity
not
on
the
floor.
we
are
dealing
with
subsidiary
activity
in
committee
by
committee
staff,
by
investigators
and
it
seems
to
us
that,
your
teaching
in
gravel
that
invasions
of
citizen
privacy
or
illegal
or
unconstitutional
actions
by
legislators
or
their
staff
are
not
immune
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
i
believe
the
technical
language
in
your
decision
in
gravel
in
mr.
justice
white’s
decision
was
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
should
not
be
extended
to
protect
the
illegal
or
unconstitutional
actions
beyond
those
which
would
prevent
executive
control
of
legislative
speech
debate
or
legislative
activity.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
their
constitutional
right
to
privacy.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
absolutely,
your
honor
that
they
were
inaccurate.
we
never
had
a
chance
to
correct
those
inaccuracies.
we
never
had
noticed
that
this
publication
was
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
they
are
libelous,
they
are
invasions
of
privacy.
they
are
violations
of
constitutional
civil
rights
protected
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
right.
all
of
the
allegations
we
would
make
if
the
respondents
were
private
persons
are
being
made
plus
additional
claims
and
that
is
that
the
deprivations
here
were
by
and
under
color
of
governmental
authority
and
that
the
bill
of
rights
as
a
protection
against
governmental
access.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
no,
your
honor
no.
the
statements
could
be
true.
it
is
still
a
violation
of
human
rights.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
i
believe
we
could
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
the
common
law
right
of
privacy
is
a
private
tort.
the
manners
disclosed
can
be
true,
they
can
be
false.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
think
we
are
in
the
law
of
privacy
where
even
if
true
there
are
areas
of
our
lives
as
citizens
where
others
cannot
disrupt
or
destroy
or
breach
that
privacy,
you
get
into
the
additional
sanction
of
libel
and
slander
if
the
statements
are
false.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
believe
the
griswold
case
in
mr.
justice
douglas’
opinions
and
other
opinions
in
griswold
constitute
a
clear
majority
of
the
court
at
that
time
perhaps
even
of
this
court
that
there
is
a
constitutional
underpinning
for
the
right
of
privacy,
independently
of
truth
or
falsity
that
there
is
a
private
sphere
it
was
known
at
common
law
and
the
constitution
included
that
within
the
special
protections
of
the
constitution
so
it
is
private
common
law
tort
plus
it
is
constitutional.
and
here
if
there’s
still
a
third-degree
of
liability
and
that
is
the
whole
doctrine
of
governmental
access
that
the
constitution
protect
citizens
more
against
governmental
access
than
excesses
are
overreaching
by
private
parties
and
that
of
course
brings
us
to
you
that
is
we
submit
your
role,
your
special
and
peculiar
role
in
this
case
because
it
is
the
government
which
is
responding
in
its
officials.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
believe
we
would
bring
that
suit
your
honor.
we
would
bring
it
against
his
aides
or
his
staff
who
procured
the
information
assuming
it
was
procured
in
the
way
this
information
was
procured
which
was
as
alleged
surreptitiously
and
clandestinely,
and
we
don’t
know
what
else
because
we
were
thrown
out
of
court
without
a
chance
of
discovery.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
yes,
i
see
it.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
correct.
also,
we
are
in
the
deep,
deep
privacy
area
no
public
figure
possibilities
or
implications
here
whatsoever
and
also
it
is
the
question
here
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
never
authorized
by
the
congress.
never
authorize.
yes,
an
investigation
was
authorized
and
we
can
see
that
but
the
investigation
resolution
clearly
spelled
out
how
information
was
to
be
procured
and
that
is
adherence.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
right.
it’s
governmental
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
it
--
what
was
done
the
manner
and
method
of
procuring
and
compiling
this
information
and
putting
it
in
a
report
was
totally
outside
the
house
rules
and
the
committee
n
the
district
of
columbia.
those
rules
have
safeguards
which
provide
minimal
due
process
protections.
none
of
them
applied
here.
the
information
was
obtained
by
an
investigator
and
a
consultant
to
the
committee
from
teachers
--
from
a
teacher
and
a
principal.
so
the
obtaining
of
the
information
was
not
--
the
method
was
not
authorized
in
the
resolution
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
incorporated
into
a
report.
this
information
was
not
run
into
a
record
through
a
hearing.
there
were
several
days
of
hearings
in
this
law,
in
this
investigation
but
none
of
them
dealt
with
this
information.
this
information
we’ve
called
it
hip
pocket
information
came
in
by
an
investigator
to
a
consultant
and
put
it
in
a
report.
the
committee
never
passed
on
the
report.
it
was
merely
sent
to
the
speaker
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
with
the
request
that
it
be
printed.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
to
the
extent
that
we
know
your
honor
and
of
course
to
spend
no
discovery.
we
have
alleged
that
the
information
was
obtained
by
a
district
of
columbia
police
officer
on
loan
to
the
campbell
hill
police
in
turn
on
loan
to
the
house
committee
as
an
investigator
by
what
authority
he
went
about
to
schools
whether
he
used
his
district
of
columbia
police
credentials
or
his
capital
police
credentials
or
was
merely
an
independent
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
we
alleged
that
he
engaged
than
unconstitutional
conduct
because
he
participated
in
a
breach
of
the
privacy.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
not
a
criminal
statute,
i
don’t
believe.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
our
position
would
be
that
it
was
a
breach
of
his
right
--
constitutional
right
of
privacy
and
common
law
tort,
breach
of
teacher-pupil
privileged
all
of
which
would
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
against
both,
the
teacher
because
the
teacher
violated
the
rules
and
the
constitution
by
disclosing
information
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
think
he
certainly
can.
most
reporters
get
away
with
it
but
if
it
is
a
breach
of
privacy
which
is
protected
a
cause
of
action
lies
for
that
breach.
now
most
information
is
given
to
reporters
mostly
by
those
who
have
the
complete
interest
in
the
information.
here
the
students
had
an
interest
and
they
were
never
consulted.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
one
of
the
cases
which
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
as
i
recall
was
a
case
by
a
private
citizen
who
was
in
an
accident
and
was
photographed
evidently
in
some
disarray,
a
lady
and
she
successfully
maintained
an
action
for
breach
of
privacy
against
the
newspaper
photographer
who
took
her
picture
in
the
newspaper
who
published
it.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
positive
yes.
now,
returning
for
a
moment
to
the
gravel
decision
as
we
understand
that
case
their
can
be
speech
or
debate
immunity
for
valid
legislative
acts
and
our
position
is
that
what
was
done
here
was
not
valid
legislative
act.
it
was
unauthorized.
the
method
used
was
contrary
to
house
rules
and
contrary
to
procedural
due
process
requirements
and
it
was
contrary
to
committee
rules
in
the
way
in
which
the
committee
report
was
processed
and
printed.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
valid
legislative
act.
the
bill
of
attainder
clause
speaks
to
a
limitation
on
speech
or
debate
immunity.
the
bill
of
attainder
provision
of
the
constitution
is
internal
evidence
within
the
constitution
itself
that
congressional
action
will
not
always
escape
judicial
scrutiny
so
that
if
it
is
a
valid
legislative
act
it
begins
to
partake
of
the
bill
of
attainder
and
if
it’s
not
a
valid
legislative
act
there
is
no
speech
or
debate
immunity.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
we
believe
it
can
be.
it
has
been
temporarily
stopped.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
actually
we
don’t
want
to
report
stuck,
your
honor.
we
want
the
students’
names
exhaust.
it
can
serve
no
valid
legislative
purpose
whatsoever
to
contain
the
students
and
their
parents’
names.
we
concede
that
every
ounce
of
information
in
that
report
may
be
relevant
and
serve
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
but
what
purpose
is
served
by
putting
the
names
of
12,
13
and
14
year-old
students
in
that
kind
of
a
report.
the
only
justification
offered
in
the
lower
court
was
a
terse
statement
that
the
names
lent
credibility.
while
we
submit
that
credibility
used
in
that
context
really
means
the
interest
that
a
gossiper
has
in
knowing
who
is
the
subject
of
gossip.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
if
it
may
and
it
may
not
have
served
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
we’re
not
challenging
that.
some
of
that
information
may
be
valid
and
useful
other
of
it
may
not
be
at
all.
we
don’t
really
care.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
probably
most
of
the
information
that
get
turns
out
to
be
not
useful.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
true.
what
i
was
focusing
on
is
the
barenblatt-watkins
really
line
of
cases
where
without
authorization
and
with
no
legislative
purpose
whatsoever
this
court
has
said
the
federal
judiciary
may
inquire
into
what’s
going
on
in
congress
and
that
was
the
focus.
here,
no
authorization
to
get
the
names
and
published
them.
no
ostensible
or
apparent
legislative
purpose.
in
fact
contrariwise,
the
constitutional
proscription
of
violating
privacy
would
indicate
that
those
names
shouldn’t
be
there.
affirmatively
that
they
should
not
be
there
not
just
negatively
that
there
is
no
need
to
put
them
there.
now,
i
might
say
that
we
are
also
requesting
a
declaration
that
the
bivens
doctrine.
bivens
versus
six
unknown
federal
narcotics
agents
creates
an
independent
cause
of
action
against
the
federal
respondents
here.
those
respondents
acting
under
color
of
federal
law,
we
submit
are
suable
and
a
cause
of
action
lies
against
them
under
the
1971
doctrine
in
bivens.
just
as
against
the
district
of
columbia
respondents,
there
is
an
independent
cause
of
action
under
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
that’s
section
1983
of
title
42
that
1983
severely
limited
the
immunity
available
to
local
officials.
now,
i
wanted
to
mention
that
we
are
aware
of
the
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
case
which
was
argued
before
you
about
five
weeks
ago.
it
is
significant
that
in
that
case
the
district
of
columbia
government
did
not
bring
to
this
court
the
issue
of
official
immunity
which
was
decided
against
the
district
of
columbia
by
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals.
the
only
issue
brought
to
you
in
that
case
was
whether
the
district
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
as
noted
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
our
case,
the
carter
decision
which
have
been
decided
before
the
doe
case
was
decided,
clearly
ruled
on
the
question
of
immunity.
however,
the
majority
opinion
below
did
not
even
mention
the
carter
case.
it
was
discussed
at
length
in
the
dissenting
opinion
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
extent
and
degree
and
scope
of
official
immunity
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
been
refined
and
honed
to
a
very
sharp
edge
in
a
series
of
decisions
beginning
with
spencer,
elden
and
leading
up
to
and
including
the
carter
decision,
and
that
the
method
of
adjudicating
official
immunity
questions
has
been
set.
the
district
of
columbia
has
not
appealed
that
method
of
adjudicating
official
immunity
claims.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
correct.
under
1983,
we
assert
a
claim
against
the
teacher,
the
principal,
the
superintendent
and
the
board
of
education.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
we
are
asserting
claims
against
the
congressman
himself,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
believe
judge
wright’s
opinion
makes
clear
that
he
was
so
much
more
concerned
about
the
sweeping
grant
of
authority
to
committee
aides
that
he
took
that
question
of
and
dealt
with
it.
now
as
you
may
recall
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
our
position
is
that
certainly
as
to
injunctive
relief
the
federal
courts
have
the
power
in
appropriate
cases
to
enjoin
a
congressional
report
that
would
be
relief
directed
against
congressmen.
now
the
question
of
damages
is
stickier
but
we
believe
that
we
can
reach
the
congressman
respondents
on
the
question
of
damages
upon
showing
that
they
participated
in
a
violation
of
our
constitutional
rights
that
as
said
in
united
states
versus
lee,
“no
man
is
above
the
law,
no
one
is”
and
if
that
means
that
you
must
exercise
your
most
supreme
power
to
touch
the
congressmen,
we
submit
it
must
be
dark.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
it
would
ask
to
the
official
immunity
doctrine,
your
honor.
let
me
recapitulate.
there
are
two
doctrines
of
immunity
operating
for
the
federal
respondents
the
speech
or
debate
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
no,
it
didn’t
but
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
courts
have
in
the
past
10
years
done
a
tremendous
amount
in
several
cases
of
expansion,
contraction
and
redefining
how
the
barr
doctrine
is
applied
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
no,
you’re
not.
but
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
bound
by
its
earlier
opinions
in
this
area
and
that
it
did
not
follow
them
under
principles
of
stare
decisis
that
court,
a
different
panel
of
that
court
had
just
decided
carter,
comes
doe
versus
mcmillan,
they
don’t
even
cite
it.
they
disregard
it
and
they
ruled
contrary
to
it
and
we
are
suggesting
that
you
need
not
reach
the
barr
versus
matteo
question.
you
need
only
declare
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
stare
decisis
principles
operate.
the
doctrine
as
it
has
been
announced
and
defined,
and
is
operating
should
be
applied
in
this
case
the
same
as
in
any
other
case.
we
did
not
ask
you
to
rule
on
the
barr
versus
matteo
doctrine.
we
merely
want
the
court
of
appeals
to
follow
stare
decisis
principles
which
we
believe
our
binding
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
they
did
not
appeal
that
question
in
the
carter
case.
now
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
certainly
i
don’
think
you
are
precluded
if
you
care
to.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
well,
it
is
our
belief
that
barr
versus
matteo
should
be
applied
perhaps
throughout
the
country
as
it
is
in
the
district
of
columbia
under
that
line
of
cases.
but
it
is
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
right.
as
to
how
person
sued
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
federal
court.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
no,
your
honor
it
is
not
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
if
i
may,
your
honor.
in
the
line
of
cases
in
the
district
the
doctrine
of
barr
was
not
played
around
with.
it
was
the
way
in
which
the
courts
in
the
city
must
apply
it
and
that
is
they
might
take
a
look
at
the
case.
they
must
take
a
close
look
at
the
precise
governmental
function
at
issue.
what
the
carter’
case
stands
for
is
you
can’t
throw
out
the
case
the
day
it’s
filed.
the
judge
has
an
important
role
to
play.
he
has
to
look
at
the
function.
is
it
discretionary?
would
it
inhibit
the
proper
exercise
of
the
government
to
hold
this
official
liable
for
the
performance
of
this
function?
that
was
the
point
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
it
was
not
proper
to
throw
this
case
out
on
the
very
day
it
was
filed
without
any
responsive
pleading.
without
any
chance
to
take
a
good
look
at
the
function
at
issue.
now
that’s
the
modification
of
district
of
columbia.
it
did
not
throw
out
barr
versus
matteo
that’s
still
absolutely
the
law.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
it
would
be
possible
by
simply
saying
that
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
your
honors,
i
flashed
on
my
time.
i
would
like
to
save
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal
if
it’s
possible.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
thank
you.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
it
is
our
understanding
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
before
disclosure
of
this
kind
of
information
is
permitted
authorized
or
required
into
the
act
that
names
of
private
citizens
must
be
excised.
i
consulted
with
the
counsel
and
it
is
our
understanding
we
do
not
have
a
copy
of
this
statute
with
us
but
that
is
our
understanding
the
same
congress
or
the
same
institution
is
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
if
the
freedom
of
information
act
were
applying
to
this
information,
i
understood
that
to
be
the
court’s
question.
what
would
be
the
standards
and
we
understand
the
standards
to
require
excision
of
the
names.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
your
may
be
right,
your
honor.
i
think
the
point
is
that
the
congress
showed
a
sensitivity
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
that
question
and
that
there
is
a
way
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
privacy
or
in
anonymity.
secondly,
it
is
our
understanding
that
the
distribution
of
this
report
was
virtually
unlimited.
we
called
and
got
copies.
we,
i
don’t
how
many
copies
we
have
and
mr.
sutton
says
that
they
have
copies.
i
believe
our
clients
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
called
the
committee.
come
down
and
get
some
copies.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
on
the
pleading.
it
went
off
the
day
our
complaint
was
filed.
there
wasn’t
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i’m
not
sure
of
whether
it
was
in
the
complaint.
i
am
quite
sure
that
in
the
arguments
that
day
on
the
motion
for
tro
there
was
some
discussion
that
it
was,
it
was
becoming
circulated.
there
was
newspaper
coverage.
i
believe
that
the
local
washington
stations
had
stories.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
your
honor,
i
am
referred
to
paragraph
15
in
our
complaint
on
information
and
belief
unless
we
strained
defendants
will
continue
to
distribute
and
publish
information
concerning
plaintiffs,
their
children,
and
other
students,
etcetera.
i’m
not
sure
that’s
as
good
an
allegation
as
might
have
been
made.
but
i
believe
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
case
in
the
one
day
it
was
in
district
court.
that
it
was
being
distributed,
that’s
why
we
went
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
the
next
point
i’d
like
to
make,
your
honor
is
that
the
district
of
columbia
respondents
are
in
error
when
they
claim
in
their
brief
and
as
mr.
sutton
did
in
his
argument
that
we
made
a
concession
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
michael
j.
valder
okay.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
thank
you.
the
concession
is
important
because
it’s
a
fundamental
argument
made
by
the
respondents
in
the
district
of
columbia
respondents.
the
only
concession
that
was
made,
was
made
by
counsel
at
the
hearing
before
judge
sirica,
when
he
said
that
he
did
not
complain
about
the
fact
that
investigators
talked
to
the
teacher
and
the
principal,
period.
he
did
not
concede
that
the
teacher
and
the
principal
had
a
right
to
give
this
information
--
these
documents
to
the
investigators
and
that
is
pertinent
distinction.
talk?
yes.
disclosure
and
passing
of
documents
with
names?
no.
there
wasn’t
such
concession
on.
i’m
sorry
if
there’s
been
some
confusion
on
that.
but
i
--
and
what’s
more
even
if
there
had
been
that
kind
of
that
of
a
concession.
we
submit
that
the
procedures
in
the
district
court
were
highly
irregular.
we
went
to
court
at
04:30,
the
day
the
complaint
was
filed
on
our
motion
for
at
temporary
restraining
order
to
be
met
by
a
sua
sponte
dismissal
on
the
merits
with
the
judge
asserting
he
thought
it
was
frivolous.
we
had
no
idea,
we
were
to
defend
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
summary
judgment
that
no
one
had
made.
and
even
if
there
may
have
been
a
concession,
we
don’t
think
that
it
is
a
real
concession
but
there
was
no
concession
on
this
teacher
and
principal
giving
the
documents
and
i
think
you
may
have
to
read
the
transcript
of
the
argument.
another
point
is
that,
we
submit
that
as
to
the
district
court
of
columbia
respondents,
congress
is
not
the
ultimate
superior.
the
law
is
the
ultimate
superior
of
public
officials
and
because
of
the
peculiar
relationship
in
this
city
between
public
officials
and
the
house
district
committee,
it
is
tempting
to
say
that
the
house
committee
is
the
government
but
it
is
not.
the
real
government
in
this
city
is
the
law
and
teachers,
principals,
boards
of
education,
congressman’s
staff
and
investigators
have
to
comply
with
the
law
and
that
is
the
ultimate
superior
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
we
think
that
the
processes
of
the
law
and
that
the
protections
of
the
constitution
and
the
protections
of
a
civil
rights
act
now
a
101
years
old
provide
us
with
the
remedy
and
that
an
injunction
is
possible
if
only
the
courthouse
doors
will
open.
they’ve
been
close
to
us
this
is
the
last
court
we
can
go
to.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
valder
i
am
sorry
it
is
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
which
incidentally
was
passed
about
two
months
after
a
bill
creating
a
territorial
government
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
is
the
reference
to
the
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
supplemental
memorandum.
we
adopt
that
position.
finally,
your
honors,
these
children
have
been
hurt
and
they
will
continue
to
be
hurt.
for
this
to
follow
them
throughout
their
lives
is
we
think
unpardonable
and
must
be
remedied.
mr.

mr.
michael
j.
valder
your
honor,
it
is
water
over
the
dam.
it
should
have
never
been
published
with
their
names.
having
been
published
we
want
an
injunction
that
further
distribution
excise
their
names
into
the
practical
extent
possible
the
report
be
recalled
with
the
names
excised.
that
is
limited
injunctive
relief;
it
is
not
broad
and
sweepy.
my
time
is
up.
we
submit.
thank
you,
your
honors.
