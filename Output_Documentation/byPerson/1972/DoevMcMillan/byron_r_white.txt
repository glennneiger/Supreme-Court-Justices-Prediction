justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
that
--
let’s
assume
that
the
group
of
publications
had
gone
--
been
in
the
congressional
context
or
just
a
newspaper
or
an
author
or
a
magazine
and
simply
gone
around
pickup
the
same
information
from
the
same
sources
and
had
published?
now
what
right
of
your
clients
would
have
been
infringed?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
are
you
claiming
are
there
anything
inaccurate
about
any
of
the
statements?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
they
were
libelous?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
talk
about
privacy.
are
you
--
you
are
asserting
the
role
of
whatever
right
it
is
to
sue
for
libel.
for
damage
to
reputation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i’ll
put
it
to
you
this
way.
do
you
think
you
have
any
right
at
all
against
anybody
you
have
to
allege
or
assert
that
the
statements
were
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
find
any
constitutional
right
of
privacy
unless
the
statements
are
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
find
that
the
statements
as
long
as
they
are
true
are
not
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
your
answer
though
to
the
defendant
who
treated
the
first
amendment
and
said
“i
am
protected
in
making
these
statements
unless
you
can
show
their
faults?”
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
alleged
that
the
investigator
engaged
in
a
little
conduct
in
the
course
of
gathering
it
like
he
entered
any
private
files
broke
any
lots
or
violate
anybody
else’s
fourth
amendment
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don’t
allege
he
engaged
in
any
specific
criminal
conduct
in
the
course
of
his
investigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understand
that
but
that’s
just
pre-stating
a
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
everything
was
except
the
names
served
a
valid
legislative
purpose?
do
you
suggest
that
the
information
even
though
false
shouldn’t
be
deleted?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
vinson,
are
you
arguing
--
are
you
urging
any
substantive
deficiency
in
the
plaintiffs’
case
just
as
on
its
own
bottom?
do
you
feel
you
must
turn
to
immunity
or
to
legislative
or
otherwise?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
for
even
considering
the
substantive
merits
within
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
vinson,
if
there
are
allegations
said
in
the
course
of
gathering
the
information.
a
congressman
or
an
aide
in
his
direction
invaded
the
constitutional
rights
of
some
private
person.
wouldn’t
you
be
called
upon
to
answer
that
allegation
even
if
you
weren’t
with
respect
to
the
later
republication?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
to
--
my
question
is
you
do
agree
that
speech
or
debate
immunity
would
not
cover
unconstitutional
invasions
of
other
people’s
rights
in
the
course
of
gathering
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
are
there
such
other
allegations
made
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
what
you
are
saying
that,
they
say
that
what
really
hurt
them
is
when
the
names
are
published.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
breach
with
that
invasion
could
not
have
and
didn’t
occur
until
publication.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
in
connection
with
a
committee
[voice
overlap]?
which
then,
wasn’t
part
of
a
committee
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
couldn’t
have
been
any
such
invasion
publishing
a
name
prior
to
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
even
the
process
of
gathering
information,
they
naturally
gather
the
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn’t
you
at
least
limit
immunity
on
the
publication
and
to
the
publication
that’s
recently
connected
with
the
legislative
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
put
it
to
you
this
way.
do
you
think
that
the
legislative
immunity
governs
sale
of
committee
hearings
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
doesn’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
distribution
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
assuming
that
duty
to
inform
is
within
speech
or
debate
clause
frame,
aren’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
have
a
duty
to
inform
but
it
may
not
be
a
legislative
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
reports,
are
there
any
allegations
or
distributions
or
publication
in
this
case
beyond
simply
publishing
for
the
purposes
of
informing
the
other
members
of
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
the
distribution
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
their
further
publication
of
the
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
why
would
--
tell
me
why
would
this
--
why
would
you
say
that
distribution
of
this
report
to
the
secretary
of
labor
for
example
be
within
speech
or
debate
clause
immunity?
what’s
that
got
to
do
with
performing
legislative
duties?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
it
the
further
most
scope
of
the
congressional
order
to
publish?
does
that
mean
that
the
congress
is
ordering
a
report
that
it
orders
printed
to
the
opened
and
purchased
by
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
know
if
in
this
case
are
you
saying
that
the
congress
ordered
not
only
the
printing
of
this
report
but
the
report
to
be
available
generally
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
was
it
available
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
still
don’t
understand
that
you
say
that
the
authorization
in
this
case
was
a
congressional?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
aren’t
saying
that
there
is
any
authority
from
the
congress
in
this
case
to
make
a
report
available
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
my
question
was
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
didn’t.
i
think,
distributed
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn’t
go
to
the
library
in
congress
and
get
them,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn’t
buy
them,
did
you?
justice
