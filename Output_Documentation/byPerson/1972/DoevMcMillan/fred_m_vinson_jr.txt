mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brief
and
that
of
my
colleague
mr.
cramer
is
on
behalf
of
those
whom
we
referred
to
as
legislative
respondents,
the
members
of
congress,
the
committee
members
and
their
aides,
the
committee
staff
who
were
named
as
defendants,
the
public
printer
and
superintendent
of
documents.
this
case
involves
an
attempt
by
petitioners
to
selectively
sensor
by
injunction
a
document
of
the
congress
a
committee
report
which
was
ordered
printed
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives.
the
petitioners
also
seek
damages
against
the
respondents
for
their
failure
to
delete
the
names
from
the
report.
a
house
resolution
which
is
printed
at
page
5
of
our
brief
authorized
the
committee
on
the
district
of
columbia
to
conduct
the
full
investigation
and
study
of
any
instrumentality
of
the
district
of
columbia
government.
the
resolution
also
empowered
the
committee
to
require
by
subpoena
or
otherwise
the
production
of
documents
as
it
deems
necessary
as
further
directed,
the
committee
to
report
to
the
house
the
results
of
its
investigation
and
its
findings
and
recommendations.
the
report
in
question
issued
after
seven
months
of
investigations
14
hearings,
all
of
which
concerned
in
the
district
of
columbia
school
system
and
the
report
contained
36
specific
findings
and
27
recommendations.
it’s
our
position
that
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
gravel
and
then
brewster
and
all
of
the
dissents
in
those
cases,
cowles
as
a
unanimous
holding
that
the
legislative
respondents,
all
of
them,
are
immune
from
questioning
in
any
other
place
on
account
of
the
matters
complained.
in
short,
we
feel
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
affords
absolute
immunity
to
the
legislative
respondents
in
the
context
to
this
case.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
think
it
is
best
to
turn
to
the
immunity
mr.
justice
because
the
speech
or
debate
clause
was
designed
to
prevent
harassment
of
legislatures
and
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
that’s
correct
mr.
justice.
the
holding
of
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
theoretically,
i
suppose
mr.
chief
justice
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
it
might
neither
be
courteous
nor
prudent.
we
feel
that
the
holding
of
gravel
settled
the
question
of
who
is
covered
by
the
speech
or
debate
immunity
and
the
scope
of
that
coverage.
the
scope
extends
to
in
the
words
of
the
opinion
a
sphere
of
legitimate
legislative
activity
and
the
court’s
opinion
made
clear
that
the
clause
applies
not
only
to
a
member
but
also
to
his
age
in
so
far
as
the
conduct
of
the
latter
would
be
protected
legislative
act
if
performed
by
the
member
himself.
applying
this
test
you
have
to
analyze
the
nature
of
the
acts
performed
by
the
members
and
by
their
staff
to
determine
whether
they
are
protected
acts,
first,
the
members
of
the
house.
now,
there
involvement
in
the
complaint
relates
solely
to
the
issuance
of
the
committee
report
which
was
authorized
by
the
house
which
was
spread
and
distributed
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
the
house
and
statute.
the
members
we
feel
are
clearly
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
of
long
line
of
cases
running
from
kilbourn
through
johnson
to
gravel
unequivocally
upheld
that
committee
reports
are
as
much
within
the
coverage
of
the
clause
as
our
speeches
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
secondly,
we
return
to
the
committee
aides,
the
clerk,
the
staff
director,
the
counsel,
a
consultant
and
an
investigator
for
the
committee
which
issued
the
report.
the
complaint
doesn’t
allege
that
the
clerk
or
the
staff
director
or
the
counsel
did
anything
with
respect
to
the
report.
it
does
allege
that
the
consultant
to
the
committee
was
responsible
for
the
investigation
and
that
the
investigator
of
the
committee
conducted
the
investigations
which
were
used
in
the
report.
now,
exactly
what
actions
are
complained
of?
turning
again
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
reproduced
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
it’s
alleged
that
seville
who
was
a
junior
high
school
principal
gave
the
investigator
the
copies
of
disciplinary
letters
and
other
materials.
it’s
alleged
that
irvine
who
was
a
teacher
gave
the
investigator
copies
of
attendance
list,
school
test
papers,
and
other
materials.
so
we
have
an
investigator
for
our
committee
and
he’s
alleged
to
such
in
the
complaint.
the
committee
was
authorized
to
inquire
into
the
d.c.
school
system
and
further
authorize
to
obtain
documents
by
subpoena
or
otherwise
if
this
investigator
was
given
and
that
the
words
in
the
complainant
given.
he
was
given
school
documents
by
school
officials
and
petitioners
now
characterized
the
obtention
of
these
documents
as
clandestine
and
surreptitious
in
attempt
to
avoid
the
holding
in
gravel.
but
they
don’t
really
challenged
the
committee’s
right
to
interview
school
officials
and
obtain
school
records
from
them.
in
the
court
below
the
majority
opinion
at
page
75
of
the
appendix
state
that
petitioners
quote,
“do
not
challenge
the
propriety
of
the
investigation
or
the
issuance
of
the
report
generally
–
i.e.
absently
use
of
their
names
-
nor
could
they”
and
the
dissenting
opinion
below
page
at
104
of
the
appendix
stated
that
“indeed,
they
the
petitioners
do
not
even
challenge
the
right
of
congress
to
examine
and
summarize
the
confidential
material
involved.
they
only
wish
to
retain
their
anonymity,
thus
we
have
a
committee
aide
receiving
relevant
documents
in
a
most
routine
way.
we
submit
this
as
an
enterable
and
legitimate
part
of
the
preparation
for
a
legislative
act.
the
graveling
of
the
petitioners
complaint
against
the
aides
and
the
congressman
too
for
that
fact
really
boils
down
to
the
failure
of
the
committee
in
the
house
of
the
representatives
to
delete
their
names
from
the
documents
included
in
the
official
report
and
the
speech
or
debate
clause
affords
complete
immunity
to
the
congressman
and
in
this
context
their
aides
with
respect
to
the
committee
report
itself.
as
the
opinion
in
gravel
says
at
page
17
slip
opinion,
a
member’s
conduct
at
legislative
committee
hearings
may
not
be
made
the
basis
for
a
civil
or
criminal
judgment
against
a
member
because
that
conduct
is
within
the
sphere
of
legitimate
legislative
activity.
as
this
court
said
in
katz
v.
united
states
399
us
at
350
in
footnote
5
virtually
every
governmental
action
interferes
with
privacy
to
some
degree.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
you
would
doubtless
assert
speech
or
debate
immunity
and
you
also
would
respond
as
to
the
merits
and
the
charge.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
i
might
add
there
that
the
bivens
case,
referred
to
by
counsel
for
petitioners
didn’t
even
reached
the
immunity
the
official
immunity
doctrine
that
merely
held
there
was
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
an
illegal
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
situation
that’s
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
none,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
oh!
i
think
the
same
answer
mr.
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
think
they
claim
a
generalized
right
of
privacy,
a
right
of
anonymity,
or
right
to
be
left
alone
and
asked
what
stated
in
katz
virtually
every
governmental
action
interferes
with
privacy
to
some
degree.
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
that
interference
violates
a
command
of
the
united
states
constitution.
many
people
who
are
named
in
congressional
hearings
and
who
are
named
in
committee
reports
would
much
prefer
to
be
left
alone
to
remain
anonymous.
but
that
wish
cannot
and
should
not
prevail
in
light
of
congress’
constitutional
mandates
and
the
protection.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
can
conceive
--
i
can
conceive
of
no
case
mr.
justice
where
in
the
context
of
a
committee
hearing
and
a
committee
report
where
it
is
alleged
that
the
contents
of
the
committee
report
breach
some
right
of
privacy
or
a
speech
or
debate
wouldn’t
afford
complete
immunity.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
they
wish
to
see
[voice
overlap].
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
they
wish
to
sensor
out
their
names
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
justice,
the
resolution
authorized
the
committee
on
the
district
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
don’t
--
i
would
argue
that
it
does
not
matter
that
congress
made
the
decision
to
publish
this
in
a
committee
report
but
i
would
urge
upon
use
that
it
is
not
without
the
scope
of
the
committee
in
its
enabling
resolution.
the
--
there
have
been
other
cases
of
speech
on
the
floor
and
committee
reports
that
may
have
been
unfortunate
but
as
the
court’s
opinion
in
brewster
points
out
at
pages
15
and
16
of
the
slip
opinion.
the
clause
has
even
enabled
reckless
men
to
slander
others.
but
as
the
court
said
that
was
conscious
choice
of
the
framers.
the
third
group
of
legislative
respondents
is
made
up
of
the
public
printer
and
his
subordinate
the
superintendent
of
documents.
the
public
printer
was
once
officially
titled
congressional
printer.
he
is
required
by
statute
to
print
congressional
documents.
committee
reports
are
required
by
rules
of
the
house
to
be
printed
and
a
statute
requires
congress
to
have
its
printing
done
by
the
public
printer.
the
printing
of
committee
reports
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
is
an
absolutely
essential
part
of
the
legislative
process
and
the
printer
is
as
much
in
the
process
as
the
investigator
or
as
is
the
committee
clerk
who
collates
pages.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
don’t
think
anyone
would
be
answerable
mr.
justice
because
i
don’t
believe
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
a
balancing
type
clause.
i
think
it
affords
immunity
to
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
to
committee
reports.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
sir
i
think
the
printer
in
this
case.
the
congress
is
required
by
statute
to
use
him
to
print
their
materials.
so
he
is
an
essential
part
of
the
legislative
process
and
to
hold
otherwise
would
entirely
frustrate
the
intendment
of
the
act.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
exactly
what
statute
provides,
the
statute
itself
title
44
which
is
printed
at
the
outset
of
our
brief
sets
up
by
statute
the
pattern
of
publication
and
distribution.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
think
it
will
might
in
view
of
the
informing
duty
of
congress.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
perhaps
you
might
make
a
distinction
between
sale
to
the
public
although
i
think
it
is
difficult.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
could
be
a
difficult
distinction
to
make
in
view
of
congress’
duty
to
inform
that
however
is
not
our
case
mr.
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
but
we
don’t
have
to
get
into
privately
publication.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
it
could
very
well
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
our
position
the
printing
of
congressional
report
required
by
rules
of
the
house
is
an
integral
part
of
the
legislative
process
without
the
printing,
how
do
the
members
the
other
members
learned
of
the
36
recommendations
and
36
findings
and
27
recommendations
suggestions
for
appropriations,
etcetera.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
indeed.
yes,
indeed
we
feel
that
the
public
printer
comes
well
within
the
intendment
and
scope
in
speech
or
debate
in
printing.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
are
none
i’m
aware
of
and
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
are
extending
and
standing
request
of
those
to
whom
committee
reports
are
distributed.
there
are
people
on
the
list
for
distribution.
i
am
not
aware
of
how
far
the
list
extends
for
instance
federal
agencies
get
copies
of
all
committee
reports.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
only
response
i
can
give
to
that
has
to
do
with
the
conforming
function.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
to
open
them
totally
to
the
public
unless
they
fall
within
one
of
these
specific
exemptions.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
really
can’t
answer
that
question
mr.
justice.
i
don’t
know
whether
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
applicable
to
the
legislator
or
not
it
may
not
be?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
philosophy.
if
need
to
be
the
public
printer
also
has
available
to
him
the
protection
of
the
official
immunity
clause
which
i
will
not
labor,
my
colleagues,
who
represents
the
district
respondents
will
be
addressing
himself
to
barr
v.
mateo.
with
respect
to
petitioner’s
arguments
concerning
bill
of
attainder
and
house
rule
11,
we
would
stand
on
our
brief.
in
closing
i
would
point
out
what
this
case
is
not
about.
this
case
does
not
involve
the
grand
jury
inquiry
nor
private
republication
of
documents
introduced
into
a
committee
hearing
as
gravel.
it
does
not
involve
criminal
charges
as
in
johnson
and
brewster.
nor
does
it
involve
a
search
alleged
to
be
a
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
in
dobrowski
and
we
don’t
have
here
kilbourn
or
powell
situations
where
legislative
decisions
lack
constitutional
underpinning,
rather
we
have
here
a
case
involving
the
most
routine
legislative
acts
all
well
within
legitimate
legislative
processes
with
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
would
take
that
position
yes.
my
prior
position
would
be
ever
that
there
has
been
no
invasion
and
constitutionally
protected
rights
we
respectfully
urged
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brief
and
that
of
my
colleague
mr.
cramer
is
on
behalf
of
those
whom
we
referred
to
as
legislative
respondents,
the
members
of
congress,
the
committee
members
and
their
aides,
the
committee
staff
who
were
named
as
defendants,
the
public
printer
and
superintendent
of
documents.
this
case
involves
an
attempt
by
petitioners
to
selectively
sensor
by
injunction
a
document
of
the
congress
a
committee
report
which
was
ordered
printed
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
the
house
of
representatives.
the
petitioners
also
seek
damages
against
the
respondents
for
their
failure
to
delete
the
names
from
the
report.
a
house
resolution
which
is
printed
at
page
5
of
our
brief
authorized
the
committee
on
the
district
of
columbia
to
conduct
the
full
investigation
and
study
of
any
instrumentality
of
the
district
of
columbia
government.
the
resolution
also
empowered
the
committee
to
require
by
subpoena
or
otherwise
the
production
of
documents
as
it
deems
necessary
as
further
directed,
the
committee
to
report
to
the
house
the
results
of
its
investigation
and
its
findings
and
recommendations.
the
report
in
question
issued
after
seven
months
of
investigations
14
hearings,
all
of
which
concerned
in
the
district
of
columbia
school
system
and
the
report
contained
36
specific
findings
and
27
recommendations.
it’s
our
position
that
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
gravel
and
then
brewster
and
all
of
the
dissents
in
those
cases,
cowles
as
a
unanimous
holding
that
the
legislative
respondents,
all
of
them,
are
immune
from
questioning
in
any
other
place
on
account
of
the
matters
complained.
in
short,
we
feel
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
affords
absolute
immunity
to
the
legislative
respondents
in
the
context
to
this
case.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
think
it
is
best
to
turn
to
the
immunity
mr.
justice
because
the
speech
or
debate
clause
was
designed
to
prevent
harassment
of
legislatures
and
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
that’s
correct
mr.
justice.
the
holding
of
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
theoretically,
i
suppose
mr.
chief
justice
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
it
might
neither
be
courteous
nor
prudent.
we
feel
that
the
holding
of
gravel
settled
the
question
of
who
is
covered
by
the
speech
or
debate
immunity
and
the
scope
of
that
coverage.
the
scope
extends
to
in
the
words
of
the
opinion
a
sphere
of
legitimate
legislative
activity
and
the
court’s
opinion
made
clear
that
the
clause
applies
not
only
to
a
member
but
also
to
his
age
in
so
far
as
the
conduct
of
the
latter
would
be
protected
legislative
act
if
performed
by
the
member
himself.
applying
this
test
you
have
to
analyze
the
nature
of
the
acts
performed
by
the
members
and
by
their
staff
to
determine
whether
they
are
protected
acts,
first,
the
members
of
the
house.
now,
there
involvement
in
the
complaint
relates
solely
to
the
issuance
of
the
committee
report
which
was
authorized
by
the
house
which
was
spread
and
distributed
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
the
house
and
statute.
the
members
we
feel
are
clearly
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
of
long
line
of
cases
running
from
kilbourn
through
johnson
to
gravel
unequivocally
upheld
that
committee
reports
are
as
much
within
the
coverage
of
the
clause
as
our
speeches
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
secondly,
we
return
to
the
committee
aides,
the
clerk,
the
staff
director,
the
counsel,
a
consultant
and
an
investigator
for
the
committee
which
issued
the
report.
the
complaint
doesn’t
allege
that
the
clerk
or
the
staff
director
or
the
counsel
did
anything
with
respect
to
the
report.
it
does
allege
that
the
consultant
to
the
committee
was
responsible
for
the
investigation
and
that
the
investigator
of
the
committee
conducted
the
investigations
which
were
used
in
the
report.
now,
exactly
what
actions
are
complained
of?
turning
again
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
reproduced
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
it’s
alleged
that
seville
who
was
a
junior
high
school
principal
gave
the
investigator
the
copies
of
disciplinary
letters
and
other
materials.
it’s
alleged
that
irvine
who
was
a
teacher
gave
the
investigator
copies
of
attendance
list,
school
test
papers,
and
other
materials.
so
we
have
an
investigator
for
our
committee
and
he’s
alleged
to
such
in
the
complaint.
the
committee
was
authorized
to
inquire
into
the
d.c.
school
system
and
further
authorize
to
obtain
documents
by
subpoena
or
otherwise
if
this
investigator
was
given
and
that
the
words
in
the
complainant
given.
he
was
given
school
documents
by
school
officials
and
petitioners
now
characterized
the
obtention
of
these
documents
as
clandestine
and
surreptitious
in
attempt
to
avoid
the
holding
in
gravel.
but
they
don’t
really
challenged
the
committee’s
right
to
interview
school
officials
and
obtain
school
records
from
them.
in
the
court
below
the
majority
opinion
at
page
75
of
the
appendix
state
that
petitioners
quote,
“do
not
challenge
the
propriety
of
the
investigation
or
the
issuance
of
the
report
generally
–
i.e.
absently
use
of
their
names
-
nor
could
they”
and
the
dissenting
opinion
below
page
at
104
of
the
appendix
stated
that
“indeed,
they
the
petitioners
do
not
even
challenge
the
right
of
congress
to
examine
and
summarize
the
confidential
material
involved.
they
only
wish
to
retain
their
anonymity,
thus
we
have
a
committee
aide
receiving
relevant
documents
in
a
most
routine
way.
we
submit
this
as
an
enterable
and
legitimate
part
of
the
preparation
for
a
legislative
act.
the
graveling
of
the
petitioners
complaint
against
the
aides
and
the
congressman
too
for
that
fact
really
boils
down
to
the
failure
of
the
committee
in
the
house
of
the
representatives
to
delete
their
names
from
the
documents
included
in
the
official
report
and
the
speech
or
debate
clause
affords
complete
immunity
to
the
congressman
and
in
this
context
their
aides
with
respect
to
the
committee
report
itself.
as
the
opinion
in
gravel
says
at
page
17
slip
opinion,
a
member’s
conduct
at
legislative
committee
hearings
may
not
be
made
the
basis
for
a
civil
or
criminal
judgment
against
a
member
because
that
conduct
is
within
the
sphere
of
legitimate
legislative
activity.
as
this
court
said
in
katz
v.
united
states
399
us
at
350
in
footnote
5
virtually
every
governmental
action
interferes
with
privacy
to
some
degree.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
you
would
doubtless
assert
speech
or
debate
immunity
and
you
also
would
respond
as
to
the
merits
and
the
charge.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
i
might
add
there
that
the
bivens
case,
referred
to
by
counsel
for
petitioners
didn’t
even
reached
the
immunity
the
official
immunity
doctrine
that
merely
held
there
was
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
an
illegal
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
situation
that’s
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
none,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
oh!
i
think
the
same
answer
mr.
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
think
they
claim
a
generalized
right
of
privacy,
a
right
of
anonymity,
or
right
to
be
left
alone
and
asked
what
stated
in
katz
virtually
every
governmental
action
interferes
with
privacy
to
some
degree.
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
that
interference
violates
a
command
of
the
united
states
constitution.
many
people
who
are
named
in
congressional
hearings
and
who
are
named
in
committee
reports
would
much
prefer
to
be
left
alone
to
remain
anonymous.
but
that
wish
cannot
and
should
not
prevail
in
light
of
congress’
constitutional
mandates
and
the
protection.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
can
conceive
--
i
can
conceive
of
no
case
mr.
justice
where
in
the
context
of
a
committee
hearing
and
a
committee
report
where
it
is
alleged
that
the
contents
of
the
committee
report
breach
some
right
of
privacy
or
a
speech
or
debate
wouldn’t
afford
complete
immunity.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
they
wish
to
see
[voice
overlap].
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
they
wish
to
sensor
out
their
names
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
justice,
the
resolution
authorized
the
committee
on
the
district
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
don’t
--
i
would
argue
that
it
does
not
matter
that
congress
made
the
decision
to
publish
this
in
a
committee
report
but
i
would
urge
upon
use
that
it
is
not
without
the
scope
of
the
committee
in
its
enabling
resolution.
the
--
there
have
been
other
cases
of
speech
on
the
floor
and
committee
reports
that
may
have
been
unfortunate
but
as
the
court’s
opinion
in
brewster
points
out
at
pages
15
and
16
of
the
slip
opinion.
the
clause
has
even
enabled
reckless
men
to
slander
others.
but
as
the
court
said
that
was
conscious
choice
of
the
framers.
the
third
group
of
legislative
respondents
is
made
up
of
the
public
printer
and
his
subordinate
the
superintendent
of
documents.
the
public
printer
was
once
officially
titled
congressional
printer.
he
is
required
by
statute
to
print
congressional
documents.
committee
reports
are
required
by
rules
of
the
house
to
be
printed
and
a
statute
requires
congress
to
have
its
printing
done
by
the
public
printer.
the
printing
of
committee
reports
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
is
an
absolutely
essential
part
of
the
legislative
process
and
the
printer
is
as
much
in
the
process
as
the
investigator
or
as
is
the
committee
clerk
who
collates
pages.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
don’t
think
anyone
would
be
answerable
mr.
justice
because
i
don’t
believe
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
a
balancing
type
clause.
i
think
it
affords
immunity
to
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
to
committee
reports.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
sir
i
think
the
printer
in
this
case.
the
congress
is
required
by
statute
to
use
him
to
print
their
materials.
so
he
is
an
essential
part
of
the
legislative
process
and
to
hold
otherwise
would
entirely
frustrate
the
intendment
of
the
act.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that’s
exactly
what
statute
provides,
the
statute
itself
title
44
which
is
printed
at
the
outset
of
our
brief
sets
up
by
statute
the
pattern
of
publication
and
distribution.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
think
it
will
might
in
view
of
the
informing
duty
of
congress.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
perhaps
you
might
make
a
distinction
between
sale
to
the
public
although
i
think
it
is
difficult.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
could
be
a
difficult
distinction
to
make
in
view
of
congress’
duty
to
inform
that
however
is
not
our
case
mr.
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
but
we
don’t
have
to
get
into
privately
publication.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
it
could
very
well
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
our
position
the
printing
of
congressional
report
required
by
rules
of
the
house
is
an
integral
part
of
the
legislative
process
without
the
printing,
how
do
the
members
the
other
members
learned
of
the
36
recommendations
and
36
findings
and
27
recommendations
suggestions
for
appropriations,
etcetera.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
indeed.
yes,
indeed
we
feel
that
the
public
printer
comes
well
within
the
intendment
and
scope
in
speech
or
debate
in
printing.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
are
none
i’m
aware
of
and
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
are
extending
and
standing
request
of
those
to
whom
committee
reports
are
distributed.
there
are
people
on
the
list
for
distribution.
i
am
not
aware
of
how
far
the
list
extends
for
instance
federal
agencies
get
copies
of
all
committee
reports.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
only
response
i
can
give
to
that
has
to
do
with
the
conforming
function.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
to
open
them
totally
to
the
public
unless
they
fall
within
one
of
these
specific
exemptions.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
really
can’t
answer
that
question
mr.
justice.
i
don’t
know
whether
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
applicable
to
the
legislator
or
not
it
may
not
be?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
philosophy.
if
need
to
be
the
public
printer
also
has
available
to
him
the
protection
of
the
official
immunity
clause
which
i
will
not
labor,
my
colleagues,
who
represents
the
district
respondents
will
be
addressing
himself
to
barr
v.
mateo.
with
respect
to
petitioner’s
arguments
concerning
bill
of
attainder
and
house
rule
11,
we
would
stand
on
our
brief.
in
closing
i
would
point
out
what
this
case
is
not
about.
this
case
does
not
involve
the
grand
jury
inquiry
nor
private
republication
of
documents
introduced
into
a
committee
hearing
as
gravel.
it
does
not
involve
criminal
charges
as
in
johnson
and
brewster.
nor
does
it
involve
a
search
alleged
to
be
a
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
in
dobrowski
and
we
don’t
have
here
kilbourn
or
powell
situations
where
legislative
decisions
lack
constitutional
underpinning,
rather
we
have
here
a
case
involving
the
most
routine
legislative
acts
all
well
within
legitimate
legislative
processes
with
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
would
take
that
position
yes.
my
prior
position
would
be
ever
that
there
has
been
no
invasion
and
constitutionally
protected
rights
we
respectfully
urged
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
