justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
they
cover
the
reporters
if
they
have
to
rely
on
some
common
law
theory,
as
i
understand
the
fourth
amendment,
it
protects
the
privacy
to
the
extent
it
does
only
against
governmental
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that’s
not
constitutional
brandeis
warrant
type,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you’re
talking
about
the
district
of
columbia
defendants,
and
not
about
the
congressional
defendants.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
their
immunity
wouldn’t
depend
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
with
this
the
district
of
columbia
said
about
the
district
of
columbia
law
of
immunity,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
take
the
barr
versus
matteo
type
of
immunity.
now
certainly
in
barr
versus
matteo,
the
fact
that
barr
may
have
been
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
did
not
lead
this
court
to
say
that
it
is
the
district
of
columbia
law
is
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
governs
his
immunity,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
buy
if
you’re
going
to
urge
that
here
is
governing
the
congressional
definite,
you
must
it
urge
it
on
its
merits.
it
seems
to
me,
i
mean
we’re
not
bound
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
says.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
vinson
as
you
refer
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
about
having
to
answer
a
question
or
answer
a
summons
based
upon
a
violation
of
plaintiffs
constitutional
rights
limited
to
the
speech
and
debate
immunity
or
would
you
give
the
same
answer
for
the
question
of
the
official
immunities.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
limiting
at
the
printing
by
the
public
printer,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
mr.
valder
for
this
--
permits
the
agency
to
refuse
disclosure
where
names
are
involved
rather
than
requiring
them
to
refuse
disclosure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
one
also
in
the
pleadings
in
the
district
court
under
your
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
in
your
pleading,
i
mean
i
presume
that
would
be
the
most
authoritative
source
for
us
is
to
whether
there
was
or
was
not
distribution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
anything
about
distribution
in
your
complaint?
