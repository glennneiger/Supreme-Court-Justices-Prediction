justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
in
the
case
mr.
justice
white
would
appeal
where
it
appears
in
the
newspapers,
where
you’ll
be
seen
in
the
newspapers,
and
then
even
though
it’s
based
on
invasion
of
privacy
in
that
sense.
you
would
be
subject
to
the
strictures
of
time
and
privilege.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can
see
it
against
newspaper.
but
here
you
rely
on
other
constitutional
provisions
because
here
you
are
involved
in
the
alleged
conduct
of
the
congress,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
far
as
the
congressional
group,
are
you
asserting
claims
only
against
congressional
employees
not
against
the
congressman
himself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
judge
wright
didn’t
consider
the
case
as
against
except
the
employees,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
this
starts
--
your
concise
opinion
without
reaching
the
more
difficult
question
while
this
cause
protects
members
of
congress.
i
will
hold
the
seven
congressional
appellees
who
are
not
members
of
congress
are
not
so
protected.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
understand
mr.
vinson,
are
the
constitutional
rights
that
the
petitioners
here
claim
were
in
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
in
your
judgment
then
would
this
kind
of
claim
reach
the
state
where
you
would
have
to
answer
as
you
suggested
[voice
overlap]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
invasion
at
the
time
of
publication
itself?
really
all
that
--
as
i
understand
this,
the
government
or
their
claim
is
that
the
anonymity
which
comes
totally.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
else
that’s
in
the
report
except
their
names
that
they
make
no
complaint
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose,
in
fact
the
publication
of
the
names
here
was
in
unconstitutional
invasion
of
the
children
involved
here.let’s
assume
that
for
a
moment,
who
would
have
to
answer
for
that
in
your
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
to
the
house
printer
who
publishes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
to
the
members
of
this
court?
you
may
be
in
that
list
for
a
while.
what
do
you
have
to
do
with
speech
and
debate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
congressional
actions?
does
freedom
information
act
can
replace
congressional
actions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
mr.
vinson
that
your
basic
submission
is
however
right
the
petitioners
may
be
that
has
been
an
invasion
here
of
personal
constitutional
rights,
nevertheless
legislative
immunity
speech
and
debate
means
it
may
be
no
judicial
inquiry
indeed
whether
or
not
those
rights
have
them.

to
that,
i
guess
it
just
starts
with
non-distribution
of
documents
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
and
reports
and
i
noticed
that
this
seems
rather
limited
to
the

150
copies
to

william

well
now,
what
authority
in

statute
is
of
distributing
this
to
the
officials
to
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it

not?
it
did
not

justice
william

can
you
tell

mr.
cramer?
justice
william

once
it’s
distributed
by
the

to
the

of

its

justice
william

thank
you.

william
j.

you

mr.
sutton

i
gather
that
the

didn’t
get
copies,

it
not?
