mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
board
is
in
the
middle
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
we
agree
with
the
union
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
fines
that
were
levied
on
members
is
not
for
the
board,
but
for
the
state
court.
but
we
agree
with
the
company
that
with
respect
to
the
fines
that
were
imposed
on
the
resignees
being
violative
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
let
me
turn
to
that
issue
first.
we’re
now
talking
about
the
fines
that
were
levied
on
employees
who
resigned
from
the
union
for
what
done
after
their
resignation.
we
believe
that
granite
state
which
this
court
decided
in
the
december
requires
a
conclusion
that
those
fines
violate
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
of
the
act.
in
granite
state,
the
court
held
that
the
unions
authority
to
impose
a
court
collectible
fine
on
a
member
for
breach
of
a
valid
union
rule
is
conterminous
with
the
contract
of
membership
between
the
union
and
its
members.
and
thus
when
a
member
lawfully
resigns
and
thereafter
engages
in
conduct
which
the
rule
proscribes,
the
union
commits
a
violation
of
8
(b)
1
(a)
to
levy
a
court
enforceable
fine
on
him.
finding
no
provision
in
the
union’s
constitution
or
by
laws
which
limited
the
circumstances
under
which
a
member
could
resign,
the
court
in
granite
state
concluded
that
the
union
members
were
free
to
resign
at
will.
and
that
they
are
right,
thereafter
their
return
to
work
was
protected
by
section
7
of
the
act
which
gives
the
employees
including
union
members
not
only
the
right
to
engage
in
union
activity,
but
the
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
such
activity.
now,
the
board
found
here
and
the
court
below
agreed,
the
union’s
constitution
and
bylaws
in
the
present
case
like
those
in
granite
state
contain
no
express
provision
limiting
the
circumstances
under
which
a
member
could
voluntarily
resign
from
the
union.
and
union
business
agent
higgins,
confirmed
this
at
page
111
of
the
appendix
when
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
provision
in
the
union’s
constitution
whereby
a
man
could
resign
by
a
letter.
the
only
way
that
he
could
resign
was
involuntarily
in
the
sense
that
if
he
fell
in
arrears
and
dues,
the
union
could
suspend
them
or
he
could
get
a
withdrawal
card
as
he
left
the
industry
or
by
death.
but
there
was
no
provision
by
which
he
could
voluntarily
resign
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
consistent
with
that,
the
union
as
higgins
acknowledges
in
his
testimony,
ignored
the
letters
of
resignation
when
they
came
in,
treated
these
employees
who
sought
to
resign
just
as
though
they
continued
to
remain
members
of
the
union.
now,
the
union
contends,
however,
that
unlike
in
granite
state,
here
they
have
a
constitutional
provision
which
obligates
a
former
member
notwithstanding
his
resignation
to
refrain
from
abandoning
a
strike
which
was
called,
while
he
was
a
member.
now,
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
provision
which
expressly
prohibited
a
member
from
resigning
during
a
strike
or
which
expressly
committed
him
to
adhere
to
a
strike
notwithstanding
a
mid-strike
resignation,
would
be
valid
for
purposes
of
such
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
has
not
passed
on
that
question
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
presented
in
this
case.
that
will
be
the
third
case,
your
honors
after
this
case
in
granite
state
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
new
constitutional
provision
of
the
machinist
contract
which
being
enacted
in
1972
obviously
could
not
have
served
notice
on
the
employees
here
in
1965
that
this
was
the
obligation
that
they
were
assuming
when
they
joined
the
machinist
in
1965.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
however,
let’s
take
a
look
at
this
constitutional
provision
here
which
is
set
forth
at
page
142
to
143
of
the
appendix.
it
talks
about
improper
conduct
of
a
member.
it
says
the
following
actions
or
omissions
constitute
misconduct
by
a
member
and
then
you
get
down
to
accepting
employment
in
any
capacity
in
an
establishment
where
a
strike
or
lockout
exists.
on
its
face,
this
provision
is
applicable
only
to
a
member.
it
does
not
provide
that
the
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
continues
even
after
the
member
has
resigned
from
the
union.
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
the
union
ever
informed
its
members
that
it
interpreted
this
provision
as
being
applicable
even
after
the
member
resigned
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
the
employees
ever
thought
when
they
joined
the
union
that
they
were
bind
to
this
kind
of
an
obligation.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
union
simply
ignored
the
letters
of
resignation
because
in
its
view
you
couldn't
resign
from
this
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not
until
after
this
court
decided
granite
state
that
the
union
begin
to
really
argue
that
it
had
a
specific
provision
in
its
constitution
which
obligated
a
member
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
even
after
he
resigns
from
the
union.
because
if
you
look
at
the
union’s
petition
at
page
12
in
the
case,
the
issue
which
the
union
poses
in
the
petition
is
whether
a
member
is
bound
for
the
duration
of
the
strike,
by
group
decision
to
strike
irrespective
of
whether
he
was
individually
opposed
to
that
group
decision.
and
the
distinction
that
they
try
to
draw
between
this
case
and
granite
state
was
that
in
granite
state,
you
could
show
that
each
of
the
employees
individually
voted
to
strike.
whereas
here
since
there
was
a
secret
ballot
strike,
you
couldn’t
show
that
they
--
that
each
one
voted
but
nonetheless,
whether
he
voted
for
it
or
not
he
was
bound
by
the
group
decision
to
strike
and
what
was
the
reason
for
this?
the
reason
was
because
in
a
strike
situation,
it
is
only
reasonable
in
view
of
the
reliance
factor
that
each
employee
who
goes
to
strike
depends
upon
the
support
of
his
fellow
employees.
it’s
only
reasonable
in
view
of
these
reliance
considerations
to
imply
a
commitment
on
the
part
of
one
and
all
to
see
the
strike
through.
now,
that’s
essentially,
a
very
same
sort
of
reliance
considerations
which
this
court
in
granite
state
said
is
not
enough
to
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
employee's
section
7
right
to
forgo
abandoning
the
strike
if
he
finds
that
he
cannot
stick
it
out.
now,
there
are
sound
reasons
for
this
court’s
granite
state
view,
which
i
submit
is
controlling
here.
the
basic
reason
is
that
section
7
of
the
act
gives
employees
the
right
to
resign
from
the
union
and
thereby
avoid
union
obligations
and
a
waiver
or
qualification
of
a
statutory
right
must
be
clear
and
unmistakable.
the
contract
between
the
member
and
the
union,
the
union
constitution,
is
analogous
to
a
contract
of
adhesion
in
the
sense
that
the
member
really
has
no
choice
as
to
the
terms
that
are
presented
and
therefore
if
he
is
going
to
be
deemed
to
have
waived
his
section
7
rights,
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
or
the
bylaws
must
be
clear
and
unmistakable
and
we
submit
from
the
terms
that
i
have
read
to
you
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
and
thirdly,
there
is
the
consideration
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
granite
state.
the
events
after
the
calling
of
a
strike
may
have
unsettling
effects
leading
a
member
who
voted
to
strike
to
change
his
mind.
we
submit
that
a
member
should
not
be
deemed
to
have
given
up
his
freedom
to
protect
against
these
serious
hardships
unless
at
least
there
is
clear
evidence
that
he
knowingly
waived
that
right
and
we
submit
that
on
this
record,
a
board
--
the
court
below
were
justified
in
finding
that
there
had
not
been
such
waive.
now,
with
respect
to
the
fines
that
were
levied
on
the
members
who
either
did
not
resign
from
the
union
or
that
portion
of
the
fines
that
it
is
electable
to
the
pre-resignation
work
activity
of
those
who
did
resign.
we
submit
that
those
fines
are
not
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
the
authority
of
this
court’s
decision
in
allis-chalmers
to
be
sure
the
fines
in
allis-chalmers
were
conceded
to
be
reasonable
in
amount.
so
therefore,
this
court
did
not
specifically
pass
upon
the
reasonableness
point
that
we
have
presented
in
this
case,
but
we
submit
that
the
logic
and
reasoning
of
the
court’s
decision
in
allis-chalmers
supports
the
board’s
conclusion
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
amount
of
the
fine
is
not
a
matter
of
the
board,
but
for
the
state
courts.
it
does
not
go
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
fines
which
apart
from
reasonableness
would
not
violate
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
are
brought
within
the
ban
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
court
collectible
fines
are
not
the
major
form
of
union
discipline.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
--
no,
it’s
not
a
hypothetical
route
because
there
are
enough
of
the
cases
so
that
you
cannot
say
that
it
is
an
academic
matter
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
allis-chalmers
with
respect
to
some
unions
where
membership
rights
don’t
mean
very
much,
expulsion
is
not
a
very
effective
remedy
for
breach
of
a
union
rule.
so,
i
can’t
say
that
it
is
an
academic
matter,
although
it
is
not
the
major
form
of
discipline.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
the
board’s
position
is
that
congress
did
not
give
it
that
power.
now,
it
might
make
a
good
policy
for
the
board
to
handle
it
--
this
is
a
judgment
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
that
is
correct.
there
was
an
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by,
i
think,
someone
in
the
entertainment
field
that
was
bringing
to
the
court’s
attention
a
fine
of
that
amount.
but,
let
me
explain
briefly
why
i
think
that
congress
at
least
up
to
now
has
kept
the
board
out
of
this
field.
of
course,
congress
is
free
to
amend
the
statute
if
it
wants
to
change
his
mind
on
this
court.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
courts
are
more
experts
in
this
matter
than
the
board
because
they
have
been
handling
it
for
years.
it
also
turns
on
the
kind
of
equitable
considerations
that
the
courts
are
better
equipped
to
handle
than
the
board
but
--
so
from
that
standpoint,
i
think
that
the
courts
are
better
suited
to
do
it.
i
don’t
want
to
say
that
it’s
impossible
for
the
board
to
handle
this
thing
because
we
all
know
that
there
is
a
genius
in
administrative
innovation.
if
we
had
to
deal
with
it,
we'd
have
to
assume
the
burden,
but
i
believe
that
congress
kept
the
board
out
of
the
field,
because,
for
several
reasons,
one
of
which
is
that
they
thought
that
the
courts
were
better
equipped
to
handle
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
if
the
question
were,
whether
it
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
if
i
am
correct
in
my
submission
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
reasonableness
of
the
amount
of
a
court
collectible
fine
to
be
a
relevant
consideration
in
determining
whether
the
fine
is
violative
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
then
the
fact
that
it
is
unreasonable
in
amount
doesn’t
make
it
violate
8
(b)
(1)
(a))?
it
may
violate
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
state
common
law
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
if
we
are
sustained
in
our
view
that
this
does
not
violate
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
it
will
then
have
to
go
to
the
state
court
in
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
but
the
defense
that
the
employees
are
--
will
be
asserting
in
the
state
court
cases
or
suits
that
have
been
brought
to
collect
the
fine,
will
raise
the
issue
that
it
--
that
the
fine
is
inequitable
or
usurious
or
unreasonable
while
under
state
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
all
i
know
your
honor
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
state
court
cases
in
which
the
question
of
the
reasonable
--
unreasonableness
of
the
fine
has
been
raised
as
a
defense
to
suits
to
collect
fines
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
your
honor,
i
hate
to
be
repeating
myself,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
the
state
court
would
not
be
deciding
this
question
under
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
be
deciding
whether
or
not
to
fine
a
man,
to
use
the
chief
justice’s
example,
were
five
times
his
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
strike
earnings
violates
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
state
law
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
with
respect
to
this
issue,
it
would
if
it
is
not
a
matter
that
is
for
the
board
to
consider
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
statute
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
with
respect
to
violence
your
honor,
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
just
outline
very
briefly
the
considerations
that
we
think
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
we
do
not
have
power
to
get
into
the
reasonableness
of
the
amount
of
the
fine.
this
court
recognized
in
allis-chalmers
that
the
taft-hartley
prohibitions
against
restraint
and
coercion
have
to
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
repeated
refrain
throughout
the
debates
on
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
other
sections
that
congress
did
not
propose
any
limitation
with
respect
to
the
internal
affairs
of
unions
aside
from
borrowing
enforcement
of
a
union’s
internal
regulation's
effect
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
thought
i
indicated
that
the
court
did
not
decide
that
question,
i'm
just
trying
to
show
you
and
explain
why
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we’re
relying
on
the
reasoning
of
allis-chalmers.
the
fine
in
allis-chalmers
was
conceded
to
be
reasonable
in
amounts,
so
you
did
not
have
that
problem.
mr.
norton
j.
come
you
left
it
open
as
we
read
it.
i’d
like
to
explain
why
the
considerations
that
were
advanced
in
allis-chalmers,
however,
would
read
to
the
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
open
question.
now,
the
fines
here
were
levied
for
breach
of
a
union
rule
against
strikebreaking
a
rule
which
the
court
in
allis-chalmers
that
was
not
only
served
the
legitimate
union
interest,
but
it
was
compatible
with
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they
were
imposed
for
working
while
the
employees
were
members
of
the
union
so
you
don’t
have
the
granite
state
problem,
that
you
have
on
the
first
part
of
this
case.
they
were
not
sought
to
be
enforced
by
unacceptable
means,
namely,
violence
or
affecting
the
man’s
job
rights.
the
only
means
used
was
a
court
suit,
a
means
which
the
court
in
allis-chalmers
and
in
scofield
recognized
was
a
legitimate
means
in
which
we
submit
or
provide
the
member
a
full
opportunity
to
contest
the
reasonableness
of
the
fine.
now,
to
require
the
board
to
determine
whether
the
amount
of
the
fines
is
reasonable
would
bring
it
inevitably,
deeply
into
the
area
of
internal
union
affairs
much
more
deeply
and
congress
entered
it
with
landrum-griffin
because
in
landrum-griffin
in
1959,
enacted
a
provision
that
said
that
you
can
fine
and
suspend
and
expel
a
member
and
enacted
only
procedural
safeguards
that
limit
the
use
of
that
power.
now,
the
court
below
here
at
29
(a)
of
the
appendix
directed
the
board
to
take
into
account
such
factors
as
a
compensation
received
by
the
strikebreakers,
the
level
of
strike
benefits
made
available
to
the
striking
employees,
the
individual
needs
of
the
persons
being
disciplined,
the
detrimental
effects
of
the
strikebreaking
upon
the
effectiveness
of
the
strike
effort,
the
length
of
time
of
the
work
stoppage,
the
strength
of
the
particular
union
involved,
the
availability
of
other
less
harsh
union
remedies
and
other
similar
considerations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
because
congress
and
this
court
too
in
both
allis-chalmers
and
scofield
pointed
out
that
the
extent
that
congress
has
not
gotten
into
this
area
and
it
was
a
very
limited
intrusion,
the
matter
of
union
discipline
is
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
where
it
was
traditionally
and
has
been
traditionally
handled.
so,
we
have
a
very
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
submit
that
if
you
get
in
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
fine,
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
rationally
stop
getting,
having
the
board
inquire
into
the
fairness
of
the
procedure
followed
in
imposing
the
fine.
you
have
to
get
into
similar
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
member
should
have
exhausted
his
union
remedies
which
gets
you
even
further
into
internal
union
democracy.
and
it
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
trial
examiner
did
and
he
came
up
with
the
conclusion
that
a
fine
that
was
more
than
35%
of
straight-time
earnings
and
more
than
80%
of
overtime
earnings
would
be
unreasonable.
and
the
board,
of
course,
did
not
pass
on
the
propriety
of
his
evaluation
because
they
found
that
they
were
not
empowered
to
do
so,
but
i
submit
that
examining
his
opinion
indicates
--
perhaps
better
than
anything
else,
the
reason
as
to
why
this
matter
should
be
left
in
the
first
instance
to
the
state
courts,
because
to
come
up
with
a
standard
is
going
to
be
very
likely
to
give
you
a
situation
that
is
divorced
from
the
realities
of
the
particular
strike
situation.
he
made
the
judgment,
for
example,
that
the
fine
had
to
be
less
than
total
deterrence.
now,
these
are
the
very
essence
of
internal
union
democracy,
your
honor,
whether
forgiveness
should
be
a
factor,
the
union
here,
for
example,
are
reduced
to
$450
fine
to
50%
of
strikebreaking
earnings
which
the
court
below
found
was
reasonable.
for
those
who
appeared
and
begged
forgiveness
as
it
were,
whether
there
is
particular
hardships
that
warrant
special
adjustments,
these
are
things
that
have
to
be
handled
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
to
promulgate
a
broad
rule,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
little
relation
to
reality.
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh
i
don't
--
i
wouldn’t
agree
with
that
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
even
where
the
only
penalty
is
expulsion
from
the
union
or
suspension
from
union
membership
for
failure
to
pay
the
fine,
you
will
find
suits
where
the
individual
would
contest
the
reasonableness
of
the
fine
or
the
fairness
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
state
court
because
if
he
is
being
deprived
of
his
membership
in
the
union,
that
is
a
valuable
right,
and
in
many
cases
may
affect
his
job
and
i
didn’t
mean
to
suggest
that
the
only
court
suits
attacking
the
fairness
of
union
discipline
are
those
where
the
union
seeks
to
enforce
a
fine,
that
bring
suits
to
contest
the
other
forms
of
discipline
as
well.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
i
did
your
honor,
i
misspoke
myself.
i
meant
to
say
in
the
first
instance
to
the
union
in
the
sense
that
may
--
would
be
empowered,
i
believe,
to
imply
or
require
exhaustion
of
internal
union
remedies
and
then
if
after
those
who
have
been
exhausted,
the
courts
would
have
the
right
to
review
what
the
union
has
done.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
it
is
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
if
i
might
--
you
know
i'm
going
over
for
a
moment,
point
out
that
everyone
seems
to
agree
that
if
that
$10,000
fine
is
merely
enforced
by
suspension
or
expulsion
from
union
membership
the
proviso,
the
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
would
clearly
take
it
outside
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
so
that
the
only
point
for
bringing
the
board
into
the
picture
is
because
it’s
going
to
be
court
enforceable
and
that
is
the
point
that
which
the
court,
i
submit,
certainly
has
more
expertise
than
the
board
has
in
this
area.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
as
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right,
but
all
that
means
is
that
if
we
win
here,
they
will
not
be
able
to
charge
it’s
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
they’ll
have
to
charge
it
is
a
violation
of
something
else.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
might
violate
the
landrum-griffin
i
don’t
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
nothing
in,
it
does
not
violate
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
when
i
talked
about
the
landrum-griffin
act,
i'm
talking
about
title
i
which
gives
you
remedies
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
court
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
the
board
has
no
connection.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
the
board
is
sustained
here
in
our
position
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
to
whether
or
not
the
matter
would
be
preempted
or
not,
yeah.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that’s
right,
but,
of
course,
it
would
be
applying
a
decision
why
this
court
which
would
define
what
the
rules
are
that
govern
the
application
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
we
don’t
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
we
have
access
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
though,
what
the
board
did
was
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
said
that
it
had
no
power
to
determine
and
a
fine
was
violative
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
merely
because
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh,
yes,
i
think
--
well,
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don’t
know
that
we
are
talking
about
the
same
thing
here.
i
don’t
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
the
board’s
position,
they
applied
the
rationale
of
their
arrow
development
case
in
here,
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
fine
violates
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
a
fine
levied
on
them,
just
because
of
its
excessive
amount.
the
court
of
appeals
disagree
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it’s
the
board's
construction
of
the
act
reached
for
the
reasons
that
mr.
justice
brennan
summarized
a
moment
ago
that
in
order
to
effectuate
congress’
intention
to
keep
the
board
out
of
the
area
of
internal
union
affairs.
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
court
can
stay
in
it
as
it
was
before
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
enacted,
not
determining
whether
it
violates
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
but
whether
it
violates
state
law,
that
would
be
the
question.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
it
has
your
honor.
this
has
been
the
board’s
position
since
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
first
enacted
in
the
1947.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there
have
been
dozen
of
cases.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
power.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
board
is
in
the
middle
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
we
agree
with
the
union
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
fines
that
were
levied
on
members
is
not
for
the
board,
but
for
the
state
court.
but
we
agree
with
the
company
that
with
respect
to
the
fines
that
were
imposed
on
the
resignees
being
violative
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
let
me
turn
to
that
issue
first.
we’re
now
talking
about
the
fines
that
were
levied
on
employees
who
resigned
from
the
union
for
what
done
after
their
resignation.
we
believe
that
granite
state
which
this
court
decided
in
the
december
requires
a
conclusion
that
those
fines
violate
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
of
the
act.
in
granite
state,
the
court
held
that
the
unions
authority
to
impose
a
court
collectible
fine
on
a
member
for
breach
of
a
valid
union
rule
is
conterminous
with
the
contract
of
membership
between
the
union
and
its
members.
and
thus
when
a
member
lawfully
resigns
and
thereafter
engages
in
conduct
which
the
rule
proscribes,
the
union
commits
a
violation
of
8
(b)
1
(a)
to
levy
a
court
enforceable
fine
on
him.
finding
no
provision
in
the
union’s
constitution
or
by
laws
which
limited
the
circumstances
under
which
a
member
could
resign,
the
court
in
granite
state
concluded
that
the
union
members
were
free
to
resign
at
will.
and
that
they
are
right,
thereafter
their
return
to
work
was
protected
by
section
7
of
the
act
which
gives
the
employees
including
union
members
not
only
the
right
to
engage
in
union
activity,
but
the
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
such
activity.
now,
the
board
found
here
and
the
court
below
agreed,
the
union’s
constitution
and
bylaws
in
the
present
case
like
those
in
granite
state
contain
no
express
provision
limiting
the
circumstances
under
which
a
member
could
voluntarily
resign
from
the
union.
and
union
business
agent
higgins,
confirmed
this
at
page
111
of
the
appendix
when
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
provision
in
the
union’s
constitution
whereby
a
man
could
resign
by
a
letter.
the
only
way
that
he
could
resign
was
involuntarily
in
the
sense
that
if
he
fell
in
arrears
and
dues,
the
union
could
suspend
them
or
he
could
get
a
withdrawal
card
as
he
left
the
industry
or
by
death.
but
there
was
no
provision
by
which
he
could
voluntarily
resign
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
consistent
with
that,
the
union
as
higgins
acknowledges
in
his
testimony,
ignored
the
letters
of
resignation
when
they
came
in,
treated
these
employees
who
sought
to
resign
just
as
though
they
continued
to
remain
members
of
the
union.
now,
the
union
contends,
however,
that
unlike
in
granite
state,
here
they
have
a
constitutional
provision
which
obligates
a
former
member
notwithstanding
his
resignation
to
refrain
from
abandoning
a
strike
which
was
called,
while
he
was
a
member.
now,
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
provision
which
expressly
prohibited
a
member
from
resigning
during
a
strike
or
which
expressly
committed
him
to
adhere
to
a
strike
notwithstanding
a
mid-strike
resignation,
would
be
valid
for
purposes
of
such
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
has
not
passed
on
that
question
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
presented
in
this
case.
that
will
be
the
third
case,
your
honors
after
this
case
in
granite
state
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
new
constitutional
provision
of
the
machinist
contract
which
being
enacted
in
1972
obviously
could
not
have
served
notice
on
the
employees
here
in
1965
that
this
was
the
obligation
that
they
were
assuming
when
they
joined
the
machinist
in
1965.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
however,
let’s
take
a
look
at
this
constitutional
provision
here
which
is
set
forth
at
page
142
to
143
of
the
appendix.
it
talks
about
improper
conduct
of
a
member.
it
says
the
following
actions
or
omissions
constitute
misconduct
by
a
member
and
then
you
get
down
to
accepting
employment
in
any
capacity
in
an
establishment
where
a
strike
or
lockout
exists.
on
its
face,
this
provision
is
applicable
only
to
a
member.
it
does
not
provide
that
the
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
continues
even
after
the
member
has
resigned
from
the
union.
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
the
union
ever
informed
its
members
that
it
interpreted
this
provision
as
being
applicable
even
after
the
member
resigned
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
the
employees
ever
thought
when
they
joined
the
union
that
they
were
bind
to
this
kind
of
an
obligation.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
union
simply
ignored
the
letters
of
resignation
because
in
its
view
you
couldn't
resign
from
this
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not
until
after
this
court
decided
granite
state
that
the
union
begin
to
really
argue
that
it
had
a
specific
provision
in
its
constitution
which
obligated
a
member
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
even
after
he
resigns
from
the
union.
because
if
you
look
at
the
union’s
petition
at
page
12
in
the
case,
the
issue
which
the
union
poses
in
the
petition
is
whether
a
member
is
bound
for
the
duration
of
the
strike,
by
group
decision
to
strike
irrespective
of
whether
he
was
individually
opposed
to
that
group
decision.
and
the
distinction
that
they
try
to
draw
between
this
case
and
granite
state
was
that
in
granite
state,
you
could
show
that
each
of
the
employees
individually
voted
to
strike.
whereas
here
since
there
was
a
secret
ballot
strike,
you
couldn’t
show
that
they
--
that
each
one
voted
but
nonetheless,
whether
he
voted
for
it
or
not
he
was
bound
by
the
group
decision
to
strike
and
what
was
the
reason
for
this?
the
reason
was
because
in
a
strike
situation,
it
is
only
reasonable
in
view
of
the
reliance
factor
that
each
employee
who
goes
to
strike
depends
upon
the
support
of
his
fellow
employees.
it’s
only
reasonable
in
view
of
these
reliance
considerations
to
imply
a
commitment
on
the
part
of
one
and
all
to
see
the
strike
through.
now,
that’s
essentially,
a
very
same
sort
of
reliance
considerations
which
this
court
in
granite
state
said
is
not
enough
to
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
employee's
section
7
right
to
forgo
abandoning
the
strike
if
he
finds
that
he
cannot
stick
it
out.
now,
there
are
sound
reasons
for
this
court’s
granite
state
view,
which
i
submit
is
controlling
here.
the
basic
reason
is
that
section
7
of
the
act
gives
employees
the
right
to
resign
from
the
union
and
thereby
avoid
union
obligations
and
a
waiver
or
qualification
of
a
statutory
right
must
be
clear
and
unmistakable.
the
contract
between
the
member
and
the
union,
the
union
constitution,
is
analogous
to
a
contract
of
adhesion
in
the
sense
that
the
member
really
has
no
choice
as
to
the
terms
that
are
presented
and
therefore
if
he
is
going
to
be
deemed
to
have
waived
his
section
7
rights,
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
or
the
bylaws
must
be
clear
and
unmistakable
and
we
submit
from
the
terms
that
i
have
read
to
you
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
and
thirdly,
there
is
the
consideration
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
granite
state.
the
events
after
the
calling
of
a
strike
may
have
unsettling
effects
leading
a
member
who
voted
to
strike
to
change
his
mind.
we
submit
that
a
member
should
not
be
deemed
to
have
given
up
his
freedom
to
protect
against
these
serious
hardships
unless
at
least
there
is
clear
evidence
that
he
knowingly
waived
that
right
and
we
submit
that
on
this
record,
a
board
--
the
court
below
were
justified
in
finding
that
there
had
not
been
such
waive.
now,
with
respect
to
the
fines
that
were
levied
on
the
members
who
either
did
not
resign
from
the
union
or
that
portion
of
the
fines
that
it
is
electable
to
the
pre-resignation
work
activity
of
those
who
did
resign.
we
submit
that
those
fines
are
not
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
the
authority
of
this
court’s
decision
in
allis-chalmers
to
be
sure
the
fines
in
allis-chalmers
were
conceded
to
be
reasonable
in
amount.
so
therefore,
this
court
did
not
specifically
pass
upon
the
reasonableness
point
that
we
have
presented
in
this
case,
but
we
submit
that
the
logic
and
reasoning
of
the
court’s
decision
in
allis-chalmers
supports
the
board’s
conclusion
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
amount
of
the
fine
is
not
a
matter
of
the
board,
but
for
the
state
courts.
it
does
not
go
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
fines
which
apart
from
reasonableness
would
not
violate
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
are
brought
within
the
ban
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
court
collectible
fines
are
not
the
major
form
of
union
discipline.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
--
no,
it’s
not
a
hypothetical
route
because
there
are
enough
of
the
cases
so
that
you
cannot
say
that
it
is
an
academic
matter
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
allis-chalmers
with
respect
to
some
unions
where
membership
rights
don’t
mean
very
much,
expulsion
is
not
a
very
effective
remedy
for
breach
of
a
union
rule.
so,
i
can’t
say
that
it
is
an
academic
matter,
although
it
is
not
the
major
form
of
discipline.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
the
board’s
position
is
that
congress
did
not
give
it
that
power.
now,
it
might
make
a
good
policy
for
the
board
to
handle
it
--
this
is
a
judgment
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
that
is
correct.
there
was
an
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by,
i
think,
someone
in
the
entertainment
field
that
was
bringing
to
the
court’s
attention
a
fine
of
that
amount.
but,
let
me
explain
briefly
why
i
think
that
congress
at
least
up
to
now
has
kept
the
board
out
of
this
field.
of
course,
congress
is
free
to
amend
the
statute
if
it
wants
to
change
his
mind
on
this
court.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
courts
are
more
experts
in
this
matter
than
the
board
because
they
have
been
handling
it
for
years.
it
also
turns
on
the
kind
of
equitable
considerations
that
the
courts
are
better
equipped
to
handle
than
the
board
but
--
so
from
that
standpoint,
i
think
that
the
courts
are
better
suited
to
do
it.
i
don’t
want
to
say
that
it’s
impossible
for
the
board
to
handle
this
thing
because
we
all
know
that
there
is
a
genius
in
administrative
innovation.
if
we
had
to
deal
with
it,
we'd
have
to
assume
the
burden,
but
i
believe
that
congress
kept
the
board
out
of
the
field,
because,
for
several
reasons,
one
of
which
is
that
they
thought
that
the
courts
were
better
equipped
to
handle
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
if
the
question
were,
whether
it
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
if
i
am
correct
in
my
submission
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
reasonableness
of
the
amount
of
a
court
collectible
fine
to
be
a
relevant
consideration
in
determining
whether
the
fine
is
violative
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
then
the
fact
that
it
is
unreasonable
in
amount
doesn’t
make
it
violate
8
(b)
(1)
(a))?
it
may
violate
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
state
common
law
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
if
we
are
sustained
in
our
view
that
this
does
not
violate
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
it
will
then
have
to
go
to
the
state
court
in
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
but
the
defense
that
the
employees
are
--
will
be
asserting
in
the
state
court
cases
or
suits
that
have
been
brought
to
collect
the
fine,
will
raise
the
issue
that
it
--
that
the
fine
is
inequitable
or
usurious
or
unreasonable
while
under
state
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
all
i
know
your
honor
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
state
court
cases
in
which
the
question
of
the
reasonable
--
unreasonableness
of
the
fine
has
been
raised
as
a
defense
to
suits
to
collect
fines
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
your
honor,
i
hate
to
be
repeating
myself,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
the
state
court
would
not
be
deciding
this
question
under
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
be
deciding
whether
or
not
to
fine
a
man,
to
use
the
chief
justice’s
example,
were
five
times
his
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
strike
earnings
violates
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
state
law
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
with
respect
to
this
issue,
it
would
if
it
is
not
a
matter
that
is
for
the
board
to
consider
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
statute
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
with
respect
to
violence
your
honor,
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
just
outline
very
briefly
the
considerations
that
we
think
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
we
do
not
have
power
to
get
into
the
reasonableness
of
the
amount
of
the
fine.
this
court
recognized
in
allis-chalmers
that
the
taft-hartley
prohibitions
against
restraint
and
coercion
have
to
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
repeated
refrain
throughout
the
debates
on
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
other
sections
that
congress
did
not
propose
any
limitation
with
respect
to
the
internal
affairs
of
unions
aside
from
borrowing
enforcement
of
a
union’s
internal
regulation's
effect
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
thought
i
indicated
that
the
court
did
not
decide
that
question,
i'm
just
trying
to
show
you
and
explain
why
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we’re
relying
on
the
reasoning
of
allis-chalmers.
the
fine
in
allis-chalmers
was
conceded
to
be
reasonable
in
amounts,
so
you
did
not
have
that
problem.
mr.
norton
j.
come
you
left
it
open
as
we
read
it.
i’d
like
to
explain
why
the
considerations
that
were
advanced
in
allis-chalmers,
however,
would
read
to
the
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
open
question.
now,
the
fines
here
were
levied
for
breach
of
a
union
rule
against
strikebreaking
a
rule
which
the
court
in
allis-chalmers
that
was
not
only
served
the
legitimate
union
interest,
but
it
was
compatible
with
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they
were
imposed
for
working
while
the
employees
were
members
of
the
union
so
you
don’t
have
the
granite
state
problem,
that
you
have
on
the
first
part
of
this
case.
they
were
not
sought
to
be
enforced
by
unacceptable
means,
namely,
violence
or
affecting
the
man’s
job
rights.
the
only
means
used
was
a
court
suit,
a
means
which
the
court
in
allis-chalmers
and
in
scofield
recognized
was
a
legitimate
means
in
which
we
submit
or
provide
the
member
a
full
opportunity
to
contest
the
reasonableness
of
the
fine.
now,
to
require
the
board
to
determine
whether
the
amount
of
the
fines
is
reasonable
would
bring
it
inevitably,
deeply
into
the
area
of
internal
union
affairs
much
more
deeply
and
congress
entered
it
with
landrum-griffin
because
in
landrum-griffin
in
1959,
enacted
a
provision
that
said
that
you
can
fine
and
suspend
and
expel
a
member
and
enacted
only
procedural
safeguards
that
limit
the
use
of
that
power.
now,
the
court
below
here
at
29
(a)
of
the
appendix
directed
the
board
to
take
into
account
such
factors
as
a
compensation
received
by
the
strikebreakers,
the
level
of
strike
benefits
made
available
to
the
striking
employees,
the
individual
needs
of
the
persons
being
disciplined,
the
detrimental
effects
of
the
strikebreaking
upon
the
effectiveness
of
the
strike
effort,
the
length
of
time
of
the
work
stoppage,
the
strength
of
the
particular
union
involved,
the
availability
of
other
less
harsh
union
remedies
and
other
similar
considerations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
because
congress
and
this
court
too
in
both
allis-chalmers
and
scofield
pointed
out
that
the
extent
that
congress
has
not
gotten
into
this
area
and
it
was
a
very
limited
intrusion,
the
matter
of
union
discipline
is
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
where
it
was
traditionally
and
has
been
traditionally
handled.
so,
we
have
a
very
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
submit
that
if
you
get
in
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
fine,
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
rationally
stop
getting,
having
the
board
inquire
into
the
fairness
of
the
procedure
followed
in
imposing
the
fine.
you
have
to
get
into
similar
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
member
should
have
exhausted
his
union
remedies
which
gets
you
even
further
into
internal
union
democracy.
and
it
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
trial
examiner
did
and
he
came
up
with
the
conclusion
that
a
fine
that
was
more
than
35%
of
straight-time
earnings
and
more
than
80%
of
overtime
earnings
would
be
unreasonable.
and
the
board,
of
course,
did
not
pass
on
the
propriety
of
his
evaluation
because
they
found
that
they
were
not
empowered
to
do
so,
but
i
submit
that
examining
his
opinion
indicates
--
perhaps
better
than
anything
else,
the
reason
as
to
why
this
matter
should
be
left
in
the
first
instance
to
the
state
courts,
because
to
come
up
with
a
standard
is
going
to
be
very
likely
to
give
you
a
situation
that
is
divorced
from
the
realities
of
the
particular
strike
situation.
he
made
the
judgment,
for
example,
that
the
fine
had
to
be
less
than
total
deterrence.
now,
these
are
the
very
essence
of
internal
union
democracy,
your
honor,
whether
forgiveness
should
be
a
factor,
the
union
here,
for
example,
are
reduced
to
$450
fine
to
50%
of
strikebreaking
earnings
which
the
court
below
found
was
reasonable.
for
those
who
appeared
and
begged
forgiveness
as
it
were,
whether
there
is
particular
hardships
that
warrant
special
adjustments,
these
are
things
that
have
to
be
handled
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
to
promulgate
a
broad
rule,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
little
relation
to
reality.
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh
i
don't
--
i
wouldn’t
agree
with
that
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
even
where
the
only
penalty
is
expulsion
from
the
union
or
suspension
from
union
membership
for
failure
to
pay
the
fine,
you
will
find
suits
where
the
individual
would
contest
the
reasonableness
of
the
fine
or
the
fairness
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
state
court
because
if
he
is
being
deprived
of
his
membership
in
the
union,
that
is
a
valuable
right,
and
in
many
cases
may
affect
his
job
and
i
didn’t
mean
to
suggest
that
the
only
court
suits
attacking
the
fairness
of
union
discipline
are
those
where
the
union
seeks
to
enforce
a
fine,
that
bring
suits
to
contest
the
other
forms
of
discipline
as
well.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
i
did
your
honor,
i
misspoke
myself.
i
meant
to
say
in
the
first
instance
to
the
union
in
the
sense
that
may
--
would
be
empowered,
i
believe,
to
imply
or
require
exhaustion
of
internal
union
remedies
and
then
if
after
those
who
have
been
exhausted,
the
courts
would
have
the
right
to
review
what
the
union
has
done.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
it
is
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
if
i
might
--
you
know
i'm
going
over
for
a
moment,
point
out
that
everyone
seems
to
agree
that
if
that
$10,000
fine
is
merely
enforced
by
suspension
or
expulsion
from
union
membership
the
proviso,
the
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
would
clearly
take
it
outside
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
so
that
the
only
point
for
bringing
the
board
into
the
picture
is
because
it’s
going
to
be
court
enforceable
and
that
is
the
point
that
which
the
court,
i
submit,
certainly
has
more
expertise
than
the
board
has
in
this
area.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
as
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right,
but
all
that
means
is
that
if
we
win
here,
they
will
not
be
able
to
charge
it’s
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
they’ll
have
to
charge
it
is
a
violation
of
something
else.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
might
violate
the
landrum-griffin
i
don’t
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
nothing
in,
it
does
not
violate
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
when
i
talked
about
the
landrum-griffin
act,
i'm
talking
about
title
i
which
gives
you
remedies
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
court
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
the
board
has
no
connection.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
the
board
is
sustained
here
in
our
position
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
to
whether
or
not
the
matter
would
be
preempted
or
not,
yeah.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that’s
right,
but,
of
course,
it
would
be
applying
a
decision
why
this
court
which
would
define
what
the
rules
are
that
govern
the
application
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
we
don’t
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
we
have
access
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
though,
what
the
board
did
was
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
said
that
it
had
no
power
to
determine
and
a
fine
was
violative
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
merely
because
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh,
yes,
i
think
--
well,
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don’t
know
that
we
are
talking
about
the
same
thing
here.
i
don’t
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
the
board’s
position,
they
applied
the
rationale
of

case
in
here,

a

was
enacted,
not
determining
whether
it
violates
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
but
whether
it
violates
state

be
the

your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton

come
yes,
it
has
your
honor.
this
has
been
the

first
enacted
in
the
1947.
