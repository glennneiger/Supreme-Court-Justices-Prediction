justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dunau,
what
is
the
nature
of
our
review
here?
i
take
it
the
board
found
against
you
on
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
against
you
on
that.
is
it
simply
your
preponderance
of
the
evidence
or
would
you
have
to
show
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
that
or
do
you
treat
it
as
a
conclusion
of
law?
how
do
we
get
at
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
termination
vote
a
secret
vote
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
consideration,
its
own
notions
of
labor
policy
in
making
that
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
come,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
thought
this
matter
should
be
left
in
the
first
instance
to
the
state
court.
that
suggests
there
is
a
second
instance
somewhere
else?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
question
of
exhaustion,
i
think,
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law?
if
the
state
didn’t
want
to
follow
that
doctrine,
it
wouldn’t
have
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lang,
under
your
theory
supposing
a
court
were
to
agree
with
you
and
after
we
decide
the
case,
a
union
brings
an
action
to
collective
fine
in
the
state
court,
can
the
state
court
entertained
that
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
union
would
almost
be
forced
to
first
bring
an
action
before
the
board
to
get
a
kind
of
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
fine
was
reasonable
before
it
could
go
into
state
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
he
doesn’t
do
that,
supposing
the
union
simply
brings
the
action
in
state
court
without
any
prior
proceedings
on
the
point
before
the
board
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
then
as
a
practical
matter
if
the
union
wants
to
collect
its
fine,
it’s
got
to
first
go
to
the
board
and
then
to
the
state
court?
