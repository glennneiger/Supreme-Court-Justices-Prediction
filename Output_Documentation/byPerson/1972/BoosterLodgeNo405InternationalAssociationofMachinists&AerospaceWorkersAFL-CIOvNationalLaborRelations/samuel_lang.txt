may

the
individual
employee
who
is
not
specifically
represented
by
counsel
here,
would
ask
whether
the
words
refrain
from
concerted
activity
in

narrowly
construed

put
him

which

18
months
or
more
as
frequently
as
it
could.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
realistic
world
of
this
individual
employee
and
his
union,
which
is
often
as
powerful
or
more
powerful
than
his
employer,
unless
the
statutory
language
refrained

gives
him

and
a
fine
is
levied
of
$1,000,
$2,000,
$5,000
and
these
are
commonplace
and
not
only
not
unusual
that
commonplace.
after
the
admonition,

he
and
his

in
that

are
fined
$1,000,
$2,000
or
$5,000
for
that
concerted
activity
that
is
a
violation
of
the
act
in
the
very
plainest
terms.
mr.
samuel
lang
there
is
none
in
this
record
here
sir,
but
the
jurisdiction
attaches
with
the
allegation.
once
it
is
alleged
that
the
fines
were
levied
for
this
concerted
activity
of
returning
to
work
of
opposing
the
union,
of
strikebreaking,
then
it
is
the
labor
board’s
ballgame.
it’s
a
labor
board’s
province
and
it
may
not
be
disturbed
by
any
other
tribunal.
now,
the
board
may
find
that
there
is
no
violation
of
8
(b)
1
(a)
because
of
the
evidence.
it
may
find
that
the
fines
were
uniformly
imposed,
that
they
were
regularly
handled,
that
due
process
was
accorded
to
all
the
parties.
all
of
the
criteria
which
it
may
establish
and
which
may
stand
the
test
of
time
and
which
maybe
uniform
for
all
fines
and
there
it
is
a
in
a
peculiar
position
to
establish
uniformity.
the
board
may
dismiss
the
8
(b)
1
(a)
charge
as
it
has
dismissed
thousands
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3)
charges,
but
it
hears
the
evidence.
it
considers
the
case
when
the
allegation
is
made
and
that
is
the
thing
of
paramount
importance
here.
until
the
board
hears
the
evidence
once
a
charge
of
8
(b)
1
(a)
has
been
filed,
it
cannot
tell
whether
it
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
it
cannot
tell
whether
the
fine
is
a
excessive
for
the
concerted
activity
that
is
the
crux
of
the
matter
which
i
believe
has
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
my
reading
of
allis-chalmers
and
the
problems
it
presented
to
the
court
which
was
somewhat
divided
in
its
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
leads
me
to
believe
that
were
it
not
for
a
special
factor
in
that
situation
and
which
is
here
present
also,
the
case
would’ve
been
decided
differently.
that
special
factor
is
quite
relevant
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
in
weighing
the
balances
--
in
balancing
the
interests
between
the
employees
as
a
whole
and
the
individual
employees,
both
having
interest
and
rights
under
the
act,
the
court
decided
that
the
erosive
effect
of
permitting
members
to
escape
penalty,
whole
sale,
any
time
they
desired
to
go
back
to
work
would
operate
against
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
that
one
single
thought
pervades
the
majority
opinion
in
allis-chalmers.
were
it
not
for
that,
i
believe
that
the
plain
language
which
gives
the
employee
the
right
to
refrain
as
well
as
to
engage
in
concerted
activity,
would
have
been
interpreted
to
allow
him
to
refrain
at
anytime.
but
i
believe
allis-chalmers
should
be
limited
to
that
interpretation.
it
should
be
limited
to
that
narrow
rule
and
it
should
be
limited
to
the
period
of
membership.
otherwise,
unions
would
be
able
to
subvert
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
by
writing
8
(b)
1
(a)
virtually
out
of
it
insofar
as
strikebreaking
situations
are
concerned,
despite
whatever
hardship
may
come
to
an
employee.
in
fact,
the
language
by
which
the
union
in
this
case
sought
to
repel
its
constitution
by
a
subsequent
amendment
would
freeze
the
employee
forever
since
he
couldn’t
effectively
resign
and
i
don’t
care
what
words
are
used;
whether
it
is
resignation
or
obedience
to
a
rule
which
carries
the
same
effect
as
continued
membership.
but
the
amendment
to
this
constitution
would
not
allow
this
employee
to
go
back
to
work
without
severe
penalties,
penalties
which
might
destroy
his
opportunities
for
employment
because
he
might
be
discharged
for
garnishment
or
he
might
lose
his
home,
he
might
lose
all
his
possessions,
he
might
be
replaced
in
the
meantime
and
lose
his
job
entirely.
this
amendment
would
prohibit
him
during
the
period
of
the
controversy
for
foreseeable
period
prior
to
the
strike
from
going
back
to
work
and
then
when
the
controversy
ended
if
it
were
a
union
shop
contract
he
would
be
frozen
again
to
the
duration
of
the
contract.
and
i
don’t
read
the
statute
or
the
practicalities
of
labor
relations
the
way
that
my
brother
representing
the
union
does.
i
read
section
8
(a)
to
provide
that
an
employer
may
without
violating
the
statute,
enter
into
a
contract
which
requires
union
membership
for
the
duration
of
that
agreement.
that
is
the
language
of
section
8
that
provides
all
section
8
(a)
3.
and
while
we
don’t
have
it
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
case
we
have
a
very
unusual
type
of
provision
from
my
long
experience
in
labor
relations,
which
instead
of
requiring
the
employee
to
join
within
30
days
as
is
usually
the
case
is,
allows
him
not
to
join
and
to
remain
free
of
union
membership.
but
except
in
right
to
work
states
the
contracts
are
legion,
almost
universal,
requiring
membership
with
all
of
the
concomitant
of
membership
and
all
of
the
requirements
of
membership.
i
can’t
conceive
of
any
freedom
of
action
on
the
part
of
an
individual
who
frequently,
much
less
frequently
than
we
redefine
print
of
insurance
policies
is
totally
ignorant
of
what
is
going
on
between
his
employer
and
his
employee
and
matters
of
this
kind
and
his
union
and
matters
to
this
kind
and
it’s
totally
ignorant
of
the
fine
print
of
union
constitutions
which
often
contained
a
hundred
and
more
pages
of
fine
print.
in
fact,
it
is
notorious
that
unions
have
an
extremely
difficult
time
obtaining
attendance
at
meetings.
i
can’t
conceive
of
the
individual
caught
up
in
this
world
having
any
freedom
at
all
under
the
statute,
any
freedom
under
the
statute,
in
strike
breaking
situations
which
are
the
most
crucial
to
him
unless
he
has
the
right
to
get
out
from
under
when
the
going
gets
tough.
and
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
rational
rule
which
allows
the
union
by
hocus-pocus
and
fancy
language
that
keep
this
employee
under
it's
thumb
no
matter
how
meritorious,
no
matter
how
much
credence
we
should
give
to
the
terms
solidarity.
there
must
be
is
8
(b)
1
(a)
means
anything
at
all,
if
the
statute
means
anything
at
all
and
taft-hartley
was
adopted
in
1947
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
individual,
i
can’t
conceive
of
he
is
not
being
allowed
to
get
out
anytime
after
a
contract
expires
just
as
he
has
the
right
anytime
a
contract
expires
to
go
to
the
board
and
file
a
petition
for
this
certification
to
get
rid
of
the
union.
so
far
as
interference
for
the
internal
affairs
of
union
is
concerned,
the
union
complaints
on
the
one
hand
that
the
board
shouldn’t
do
it
and
on
the
other
hand
ask
that
the
courts
to
be
allowed
to
do
it.
that
poses
the
question
since
we
all
agree
that
somebody
should
do
it
to
the
extent
of
protecting
this
individual
and
poses
a
question
who
is
the
best
qualified
to
do
it.
and
if
the
labor
board,
with
all
of
its
expertise
in
thousands
of
strike
situations,
has
any
business
in
this
field
at
all,
that
is
if
it
has
any
authority
to
entertain
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
employee
maybe
fined
then
it
has
the
business
to
decide
all
of
it.
in
case
after
case,
the
board
does
not
get
only
those
cases,
only
those
situations
where
employees
have
not
resigned,
and
therefore,
can
follow
allis-chalmers.
in
case
after
case,
there
will
be
employees
who
have
resigned
and
employees
who
have
not
resigned.
moreover,
as
to
those
who
have
resigned
there
will
be
problems
requiring
interpretation
of
the
language
even
to
this
amendment
in
this
case
as
to
what
it
means
so
that
the
board
cannot
escape
dealing
with
the
problem
of
fines.
the
question
is,
is
it
going
to
deal
with
that
problem
piecemeal,
is
it
going
to
handle
just
this
little
bit
and
say
the
rest
belongs
to
the
courts
or
is
it
going
to
be
required
to
do
what
i
think
is
his
duty
to
handle
the
whole
ball
of
wax
and
dispose
of
the
all
ball
of
wax
one
way
or
the
other.
that
seems
to
be
the
rational
of
this
court
running
from
garner
against
teamsters,
through
garmon
against
san
diego
and
all
the
other
preemption
cases.
i
don’t
say
that
this
is
a
case
of
preemption.
i
say,
it
as
a
practical
matter
tied
to
a
clear
legal
right
that
all
of
this
belongs
to
the
board
including
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
fines
are
reasonable.
mr.
samuel
lang
i
think
that
as
in
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer,
but
i
would
say
that
at
the
very
least
once
the
board
decides
that
the
fine
is
reasonable,
it
could
be
enforced
in
the
same
manner
in
which
a
--
well,
that
decision
would
be
binding
upon
the
state
court
for
collections
since
the
board
itself
has
no
collection
powers,
it
can’t,
it
can’t
tell
an
employee
to
pay
the
fine,
i
don’t
know
maybe
it
has
very
broad
remedial
powers.
perhaps
the
board
could
say,
the
fine
is
reasonable,
pay
it,
but
even
if
it
couldn’t
do
that,
once
it
decided
that
the
fine
was
not
unreasonable
and
that’s
the
way
i
prefer
to
put
it
that
the
board’s
power
should
be
limited
to
finding
that
the
fine
is
not
excessive
because
it
would
be
the
excessive
nature
to
fine
for
discriminatory
reason,
for
discriminatory
purpose
that
wouldn’t
cause
the
violation.
once
the
board
found
that
the
fine
was
not
excessive
then
the
collection
if
it
had
to
go
to
the
state
court,
it
would
be
automatic.
the
state
court
would
have
no
power
except
to
enforce
a
judgment
as
it
would
a
judgment
in
another
jurisdiction.
mr.
samuel
lang
it
wouldn’t
be
the
union
that
would
bring
the
action,
it
would
be
the
individual
who
is
fined,
who
could
go
counsel
free
without
the
heavy
expense
of
having
to
go
into
court.
he
could
go
to
the
board
and
file
the
8
(b)
1
(a)
charge
on
the
basis
that
the
fine
was
discriminatory
--
mr.
samuel
lang
then
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
say,
we
don’t
have
jurisdiction
it
must
go
to
the
board.
mr.
samuel
lang
in
one
way
or
another,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes
sir.
the
trial
examiner
dealt
with
it,
the
board
didn’t.
the
board
said,
it
didn’t
have
the
power
or
authority
to
deal
with
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
the
fines.
and
i
think
that
the
board
should
do
in
this
case
what
it
does
in
8
(a)
(3)
cases;
what
it
does
in
cases
of
unfair
labor
practice
against
employees;
they
should
draw
inferences
from
all
the
facts.
it
should
reach
out
as
broadly
to
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
against
a
union
particularly
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
it
were
there
is
very
sensitive
problems
involved,
it
should
reach
out
to
find
out
whether
or
not
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
just
as
broadly
as
it
reaches
out
in
cases
involving
employers.

whole
and
the
individual
employees,
both
having
interest
and
rights
under
the
act,
the
court
decided
that
the
erosive
effect
of
permitting
members
to
escape
penalty,
whole
sale,
any
time
they
desired
to
go
back
to
work
would
operate
against
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
that
one
single
thought
pervades
the
majority
opinion
in
allis-chalmers.
were
it
not
for
that,
i
believe
that
the
plain
language
which
gives
the
employee
the
right
to
refrain
as
well
as
to
engage
in
concerted
activity,
would
have
been
interpreted
to
allow
him
to
refrain
at
anytime.
but
i
believe
allis-chalmers
should
be
limited
to
that
interpretation.
it
should
be
limited
to
that
narrow
rule
and
it
should
be
limited
to
the
period
of
membership.
otherwise,
unions
would
be
able
to
subvert
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
by
writing
8
(b)
1
(a)
virtually
out
of
it
insofar
as
strikebreaking
situations
are
concerned,
despite
whatever
hardship
may
come
to
an
employee.
in
fact,
the
language
by
which
the
union
in
this
case
sought
to
repel
its
constitution
by
a
subsequent
amendment
would
freeze
the
employee
forever
since
he
couldn’t
effectively
resign
and
i
don’t
care
what
words
are
used;
whether
it
is
resignation
or
obedience
to
a
rule
which
carries
the
same
effect
as
continued
membership.
but
the
amendment
to
this
constitution
would
not
allow
this
employee
to
go
back
to
work
without
severe
penalties,
penalties
which
might
destroy
his
opportunities
for
employment
because
he
might
be
discharged
for
garnishment
or
he
might
lose
his
home,
he
might
lose
all
his
possessions,
he
might
be
replaced
in
the
meantime
and
lose
his
job
entirely.
this
amendment
would
prohibit
him
during
the
period
of
the
controversy
for
foreseeable
period
prior
to
the
strike
from
going
back
to
work
and
then
when
the
controversy
ended
if
it
were
a
union
shop
contract
he
would
be
frozen
again
to
the
duration
of
the
contract.
and
i
don’t
read
the
statute
or
the
practicalities
of
labor
relations
the
way
that
my
brother
representing
the
union
does.
i
read
section
8
(a)
to
provide
that
an
employer
may
without
violating
the
statute,
enter
into
a
contract
which
requires
union
membership
for
the
duration
of
that
agreement.
that
is
the
language
of
section
8
that
provides
all
section
8
(a)
3.
and
while
we
don’t
have
it
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
case
we
have
a
very
unusual
type
of
provision
from
my
long
experience
in
labor
relations,
which
instead
of
requiring
the
employee
to
join
within
30
days
as
is
usually
the
case
is,
allows
him
not
to
join
and
to
remain
free
of
union
membership.
but
except
in
right
to
work
states
the
contracts
are
legion,
almost
universal,
requiring
membership
with
all
of
the
concomitant
of
membership
and
all
of
the
requirements
of
membership.
i
can’t
conceive
of
any
freedom
of
action
on
the
part
of
an
individual
who
frequently,
much
less
frequently
than
we
redefine
print
of
insurance
policies
is
totally
ignorant
of
what
is
going
on
between
his
employer
and
his
employee
and
matters
of
this
kind
and
his
union
and
matters
to
this
kind
and
it’s
totally
ignorant
of
the
fine
print
of
union
constitutions
which
often
contained
a
hundred
and
more
pages
of
fine
print.
in
fact,
it
is
notorious
that
unions
have
an
extremely
difficult
time
obtaining
attendance
at
meetings.
i
can’t
conceive
of
the
individual
caught
up
in
this
world
having
any
freedom
at
all
under
the
statute,
any
freedom
under
the
statute,
in
strike
breaking
situations
which
are
the
most
crucial
to
him
unless
he
has
the
right
to
get
out
from
under
when
the
going
gets
tough.
and
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
rational
rule
which
allows
the
union
by
hocus-pocus
and
fancy
language
that
keep
this
employee
under
it's
thumb
no
matter
how
meritorious,
no
matter
how
much
credence
we
should
give
to
the
terms
solidarity.
there
must
be
is
8
(b)
1
(a)
means
anything
at
all,
if
the
statute
means
anything
at
all
and
taft-hartley
was
adopted
in
1947
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
individual,
i
can’t
conceive
of
he
is
not
being
allowed
to
get
out
anytime
after
a
contract
expires
just
as
he
has
the
right
anytime
a
contract
expires
to
go
to
the
board
and
file
a
petition
for
this
certification
to
get
rid
of
the
union.
so
far
as
interference
for
the
internal
affairs
of
union
is
concerned,
the
union
complaints
on
the
one
hand
that
the
board
shouldn’t
do
it
and
on
the
other
hand
ask
that
the
courts
to
be
allowed
to
do
it.
that
poses
the
question
since
we
all
agree
that
somebody
should
do
it
to
the
extent
of
protecting
this
individual
and
poses
a
question
who
is
the
best
qualified
to
do
it.
and
if
the
labor
board,
with
all
of
its
expertise
in
thousands
of
strike
situations,
has
any
business
in
this
field
at
all,
that
is
if
it
has
any
authority
to
entertain
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
employee
maybe
fined
then
it
has
the
business
to
decide
all
of
it.
in
case
after
case,
the
board
does
not
get
only
those
cases,
only
those
situations
where
employees
have
not
resigned,
and
therefore,
can
follow
allis-chalmers.
in
case
after
case,
there
will
be
employees
who
have
resigned
and
employees
who
have
not
resigned.
moreover,
as
to
those
who
have
resigned
there
will
be
problems
requiring
interpretation
of
the
language
even
to
this
amendment
in
this
case
as
to
what
it
means
so
that
the
board
cannot
escape
dealing
with
the
problem
of
fines.
the
question
is,
is
it
going
to
deal
with
that
problem
piecemeal,
is
it
going
to
handle
just
this
little
bit
and
say
the
rest
belongs
to
the
courts
or
is
it
going
to
be
required
to
do
what
i
think
is
his
duty
to
handle
the
whole
ball
of
wax
and
dispose
of
the
all
ball
of
wax
one
way
or
the
other.
that
seems
to
be
the
rational
of
this
court
running
from
garner
against
teamsters,
through
garmon
against
san
diego
and
all
the
other
preemption
cases.
i
don’t
say
that
this
is
a
case
of
preemption.
i
say,
it
as
a
practical
matter
tied
to
a
clear
legal
right
that
all
of
this
belongs
to
the
board
including
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
fines
are
reasonable.
mr.
samuel
lang
i
think
that
as
in
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer,
but
i
would
say
that
at
the
very
least
once
the
board
decides
that
the
fine
is
reasonable,
it
could
be
enforced
in
the
same
manner
in
which
a
--
well,
that
decision
would
be
binding
upon
the
state
court
for
collections
since
the
board
itself
has
no
collection
powers,
it
can’t,
it
can’t
tell
an
employee
to
pay
the
fine,
i
don’t
know
maybe
it
has
very
broad
remedial
powers.
perhaps
the
board
could
say,
the
fine
is
reasonable,
pay
it,
but
even
if
it
couldn’t
do
that,
once
it
decided
that
the
fine
was
not
unreasonable
and
that’s
the
way
i
prefer
to
put
it
that
the
board’s
power
should
be
limited
to
finding
that
the
fine
is
not
excessive
because
it
would
be
the
excessive
nature
to
fine
for
discriminatory
reason,
for
discriminatory
purpose
that
wouldn’t
cause
the
violation.
once
the
board
found
that
the
fine
was
not
excessive
then
the
collection
if
it
had
to
go
to
the
state
court,
it
would
be
automatic.
the
state
court
would
have
no
power
except
to
enforce
a
judgment
as
it
would
a
judgment
in
another
jurisdiction.
mr.
samuel
lang
it
wouldn’t
be
the
union
that
would
bring
the
action,
it
would
be
the
individual
who
is
fined,
who
could
go
counsel
free
without
the
heavy
expense
of
having
to
go
into
court.
he
could
go
to
the
board
and
file
the
8
(b)
1
(a)
charge
on
the
basis
that
the
fine
was
discriminatory
--
mr.
samuel
lang
then
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
say,
we
don’t
have
jurisdiction
it
must
go
to
the
board.
mr.
samuel
lang
in
one
way
or
another,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes
sir.
the
trial
examiner
dealt
with
it,
the
board
didn’t.
the
board
said,
it
didn’t
have
the
power
or
authority
to
deal
with
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
the
fines.
and
i
think
that
the
board
should
do
in
this
case
what
it
does
in
8
(a)
(3)
cases;
what
it
does
in
cases
of
unfair
labor
practice
against
employees;
they
should
draw
inferences
from
all
the
facts.
it
should
reach
out
as
broadly
to
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
against
a
union
particularly
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
it
were
there
is
very
sensitive
problems
involved,
it
should
reach
out
to
find
out
whether
or
not
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
just
as
broadly
as
it
reaches
out
in
cases
involving
employers.
