this

in

booster

no.
405
and
others
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
consolidated
with
71-1607,
national
labor
relations
board
against
the
boeing
co.
mr.
dunau,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dunau?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
union
has
the
right
to
discharge/dismiss
from
the
membership
of
the
union
an
employee
who
doesn’t
pay
his
fine
or
is
their
only
remedy,
the
power
to
go
into
the
state
courts
to
collect
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
make
any
distinction
mr.
dunau
between
members
of
unions
who
are
members
as
a
matter
of
compulsion
and
those
who
are
members
as
a
matter
of
choice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
can
he
be
a
member,
but
reject
this
provision
with
reference
to
strikebreaking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you’re
placing
this
as
i
take
it
as
a
matter
of
contract
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
not
the
combination
of
the
section
of
the
statute
you
just
preferred
to
and
the
contract
that’s
made
pursuant
to
that,
that
is
that
when
a
member
joins
the
union
he
has
a
contract
obligation
at
least
i
have
understood
that
to
be
your
argument,
a
contract
obligation
to
comply
with
those
provisions
of
the
union
about
not
breaking
strikes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
is
it
then
not,
coming
back
to
my
original
question,
at
least
the
combination
of
the
statute
and
the
contract
made
pursuant
to
that
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
apply
in
a
situation
where
a
member
is
outside
of
this
case
because
where
a
member
is
permitted
not
to
join
the
union
if
he
pays
the
equivalent
in
a
contribution
for
dues?
he
then
has
no
obligations
under
the
constitution
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
the
employees
have
that
option
under
this
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
dunau.
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
idea
of
what
percentage
of
these
situations
are
dealt
within
the
suit
in
the
state
court
as
compared
with
making
a
reinstatement
in
the
union
conditioned
upon
payment
of
the
fine?
in
other
words,
in
most
of
the
situations
does
not
the
union
simply
say,
if
you
want
to
be
reinstated,
you
pay
your
fine
and
therefore,
there
is
no
state
court
jurisdiction
action
in
most
of
them
or
is
that
evaluation
wrong?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
a
practical
matter
why
would
a
union
go
through
the
trouble
of
bringing
an
action
in
the
state
court
when
they
have
such
a
simple
remedy
for
collection,
namely
to
say,
we
won’t
reinstate
you
till
you
pay
the
fine
--
no
lawyer’s
fees,
no
delay,
no
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
really
a
hypothetical
route,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
union
rules
required
a
fine
of
five
times
the
amount
of
the
wages
earned,
would
you
think
the
board
should
not
concern
itself
with
that?
that’s
hypothetical
at
first
because
no
union
does
so,
but
i'm
addressing
myself
to
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
find
it's
hard
to
square
with
prior
arguments
the
board
has
made
on
preemption
in
this
court
when
we
have
state
court's
undertaking
to
restrain
a
union
on
even
grounds
that
it’s
necessary
to
control
violence
and
damage
to
property.
the
board
i
thought
consistently
takes
the
position
that
the
federal
--
the
congress
has
preempted
this
whole
relationship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
confronted
with
the
arguments
frequently
even
in
claims
of
violence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it’s
alright
for
a
state
court
to
get
its
arm
into
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come,
if
it
appeared
and
apparently
we
haven’t
anything
in
this
record
and
perhaps
none
of
us
have
any
means
of
knowing,
at
this
time,
but
if
it
appeared
that
80%
to
90%
of
all
the
fines
were
collected
by
a
restriction
that
there
would
be
no
reinstatement
of
the
union
member
to
membership
until
he
paid
his
fines
leaving
only
10%
or
so
to
collection
in
the
state
courts.
then
all
of
this
discussion
about
state
courts
recedes
in
importance,
doesn't
it,
because
in
the
80%
to
90%
of
these
hypothetical
situations
no
one
is
revealing
the
reasonableness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
would
he
contest
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lang.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
evidence
mr.
lang,
do
you
point
to
in
the
record
other
than
the
fact
that
a
119
more
or
less
employees
went
back
to
work?
what
evidence
of
concerted
activity
other
than
that
you
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
dealing
with
the
discriminatory
situation
you
have
mentioned
with
all
who
has
have
review
power.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
suppose
when
you
refer
to
a
discriminatory
situation
that
if
out
of
the
119
people
involved
here,
they
had
admittedly
reasonable
fines
as
to
110
of
them,
but
picked
out
nine
and
had
much
larger
fines,
then
board
should
review
a
claim
that
they
were
being
subject
to
a
discriminatory
fine
because
they
were
the
leaders
of
the
return
to
work
movement
or
something
of
that
kind.
is
that
the
kind
of
discrimination
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
lang.
mr.
dunau,
you
have
run
out
of
time
but
we
extended
mr.
come’s
time
here
even
though
he
was
hitting
and
abating
your
position,
but
i
have
a
question
or
two
to
put
if
you
don’t
mind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there
are
somewhere
between
1000
and
2500
courts
of
general
jurisdictions
in
the
systems
of
the
50
states,
but
in
any
event
it’s
a
very
large
number.
doesn’t
your
position
and
that
of
mr.
come's
to
open
this
whole
area
to
very
great
disparity
of
evaluating
and
reviewing
fines
in
those
cases
which
would
get
into
the
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
of
your
particular
union
here,
your
clients
in
the
past
year
or
in
any
year,
how
many
cases
got
into
the
state
courts
on
strikebreaking
fine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
then
it’s
better
--
it’s
more
cohesive
and
consistent
with
the
whole
history
of
the
labor
act
to
have
the
courts
of
50
different
states
doing
this
instead
of
one
policy
by
the
board
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
