that's
so
mr.

well,
that

the

suggested
that
if
we

(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you’re
saying
i
gather
mr.
come
is
that
congress
wanted
the
board
to
stay
out
of
the
internal
affairs
of
unions
and
to
get
into
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
fine
is
to
get
your
neck
into
the
question
of
union
--
internal
union
affairs
not
violates
the
congressional
policy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

state
courts
often
when
they
thought
union
membership
discipline
was
too
harsh,
they’ve
taken
steps
to
set
it
aside,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.

oh
yeah.
