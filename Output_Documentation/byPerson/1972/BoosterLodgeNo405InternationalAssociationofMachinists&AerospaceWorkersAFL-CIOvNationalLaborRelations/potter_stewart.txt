it’s

a

that
was
the
rationale
of
the,
what
was
it,
the
first
circuit
in
granite
state
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
last
december,
wasn’t
it?
justice

stewart
well
then
if
this
a
rule
then
as
to
acquisition

retention
of
membership
to
use
the
statutory
language,
then
what
the
rule
really
amounts
to
is
that
you
cannot
resign
during
a
strike?
justice

that’s
what
it
has
to
be
or
else
it
doesn’t
have
anything
to

with

justice

i
have
very
great
difficulty
in
seeing
that
that
has
to
do
with
acquisition
or
retention
of

within
the
meaning
of
the

unless,
you
argue
that
what
you
may
say
is
that

the

justice

stewart
now,
mr.
come,
the
only
reason
as
i
understand
that
these
fines
are
alleged
to
be
unreasonably
high
is
that
they
violate
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
act,
isn’t
that
right?
justice

stewart
now,
what
criteria
would
you
suppose
that
a
state
court
would
apply
engaging
the
reasonableness
build
on
these
fines?
justice
potter
stewart
the
criterion
is,
whether
or
not
the
whole
claim
is
that
they
were
so
unreasonable
that
they
violated
8
(b)
1
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
and
doesn’t
the
labor
board
know
a
good
deal
more
about
that
act
and
the
--
your
--
the
mind
run
of
state
trial
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
only
question,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
possibly
could
violate
in
the
law
if
the
--
if
after
due
process
or
the
union
procedures,
a
fine
of
x
dollars
was
levied
and
under
allis-chalmers
that
could
be
collected
in
a
state
court.
what
possible
criterion
could
a
state
apply
to
say,
it’s
unreasonable
when
the
only
claim
that’s
ever
been
made
in
this
case
is
that
it
is
unreasonable
by
reason
of
and
only
by
reason
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended?
justice
potter
stewart
what
criterion?
will
they
be
asked
to
apply
the
measure
whether
it’s
reasonable
or
unreasonable?
there
is
no
claim
that
it’s
unreasonable
except
in
terms
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)?
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
usury?
justice
potter
stewart
what
measure
--
what
measure
is
the
court
and
we
are
assuming
by
hypothesis,
by
assumption,
this
was
a
due
process
union,
internal
union
procedure
that
resulted
in
the
imposition
of
a
fine
of
x
dollars.
the
only
attack
upon
its
amount
has
been
under
the
act,
under
the
act.
now,
a
state
court
is
not,
certainly
with
all
the
preemption
cases
on
this
book
you
say,
a
state
court
has
the
expertise
to
decide
that
question
under
the
act
and
that
the
labor
board
does
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
repeating
myself
too.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
would
it
be
deciding
it
under
that?
justice

stewart
his
what?
justice
potter
stewart
what,
violates
what?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
come,
is
it
then
basically
your
position
that
an
extremely
high
fine,
an
unreasonably
high
fine,
however,
one
might
define,
let’s
begin
with
the
assumption
that
it’s
an
unreasonably
high
fine,
would
simply
not
be
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
fine
on
somebody
who
worked
for
two
days
would
not
be
a
violation
of
anything
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
on
acquisition
or
retention?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
still
would
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
the
only
claim
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
your
--
well,
it’s
--
i’ve
understood
you
just
say
that
it’s
your
position
that
an
extremely,
grossly,
unreasonably
high
fine
by
assumption
violates
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
say
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
must
mean
that
doesn’t
violate
anything
in
the
act
that
board
is
charged
with
enforcing?
justice
potter
stewart
in
court.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice

what
body

the

apply
to
