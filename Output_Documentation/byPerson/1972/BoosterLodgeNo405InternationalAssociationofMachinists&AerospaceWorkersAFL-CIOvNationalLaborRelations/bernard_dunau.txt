mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
questions
in
this
case.
one,
where
a
union
rule
prohibits
a
member
from
engaging
in
strike
making
–
strikebreaking,
may
that
rule
be
fairly,
reasonably
and
validly
interpreted
to
require
that
an
employee
who
was
a
member
of
the
union
at
the
time
the
strike
began
is
required
to
observe
the
existing
union
obligation
that
he
had
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
for
the
duration
of
that
strike,
notwithstanding
his
resignation
in
the
midst
of
the
strike.
the
second
question
we
have,
is
whether
the
labor
board
is
empowered
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
size
of
a
union
fine
imposed
against
a
member
for
engaging
in
strikebreaking.
these
two
questions
arise
in
these
circumstances.
boeing
and
booster
lodge
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
expires
on
september
15,
1965.
no
agreement
is
reached.
the
next
day
a
strike
begins.
the
strike
lasts
18
days.
on
october
3,
an
agreement
is
reached,
the
strike
ends.
there
were
1,900
employees
in
the
unit
that
was
struck.
of
these
143
returned
to
work
during
the
course
of
the
strike,
24
never
resigned.
they
retained
their
membership
throughout
the
strike,
but
engaged
in
strikebreaking.
119
did
resign.
of
these
119,
61
returned
to
work
after
their
resignation
and
58
returned
to
work
before
their
resignation.
all,
without
regard
to
whether
they
resigned
or
when
they
returned
to
work,
were
found
guilty
after
internal
union
proceedings
of
having
engaged
in
misconduct
in
violation
of
the
machinist
constitution,
which
defined
as
misconduct
of
a
member
accepting
employment
in
any
capacity
in
an
establishment
where
a
strike
or
lockout
exists
as
recognized
under
this
constitution
without
permission.
those
accused
who
appeared
for
trial
apologized
and
pledged
future
loyalty
to
the
union,
were
in
substance
fined
50%
of
their
strikebreaking
earnings.
what
they
earned
from
the
struck
employer
was
the
measure
of
their
fine,
one-half
was
the
fine.
those
who
did
not
appear
for
trial
and
were
found
guilty,
were
fined
a
flat
sum
of
$450.
this
case
came
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
a
complaint
which
alleged
that
the
imposition
of
the
fines
which
were
court
collectible,
the
union
sought,
threatened
to
institute
court
proceedings
and
did
institute
court
proceedings
to
collect
these
fines.
the
claim
before
the
board
was
that
the
imposition
of
the
fines
constituted
restraint
and
coercion
of
the
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
refrain
from
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
the
claim
is
divided
into
two
parts.
as
to
those
employees
who
never
resigned
and
as
to
those
employees
who
resigned,
but
engaged
in
strikebreaking
prior
to
the
resignation.
it
was
said
that
the
restraint
and
coercion
resided
in
the
unreasonableness
of
the
size
of
the
fine.
it
was
too
large
and
therefore
it
was
restraint
or
coercion.
the
board
dismissed
that
part
of
the
complaint.
it
said
given
the
validity
of
the
union
rule
against
strikebreaking,
the
size
of
the
fine
was
not
its
business.
it
was
the
business
of
a
state
court
on
a
suit
to
collect
or
set
aside
that
fine,
the
state
court
would
decide
whether
or
not
the
fine
was
too
large.
as
to
second
claim,
the
complaint
alleged
that
those
who
engaged
in
post
resignation
strikebreaking,
no
fine
in
any
amount
could
be
levied
against
them
and
so
the
restraint
and
coercion
with
respect
to
people
who
were
engaged
in
post
resignation
strikebreaking
was
that
any
internal
union
discipline
by
way
of
a
court
collectible
fine
was
of
itself
restraint
and
coercion.
the
board
held
that
it
was,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that
determination.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
board’s
determination
that
it
had
no
power
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
a
fine
and
both
questions
are
here
on
the
union’s
petition
and
the
reasonableness
of
fine
issue
on
the
board’s
petition
as
well.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
with
respect
to
a
person
who
did
not
resign,
the
union
can
do
a
number
of
things.
it
can
expel
him.
it
can
fine
him
and
say
that
the
penalty
or
the
sanction
for
not
paying
the
fine
will
be
expulsion
or
it
can
do
as
it
did
in
allis
chalmers
and
was
validated
in
allis
chalmers,
it
can
sue
in
court
for
the
collection
of
the
fine.
with
respect
to
a
resigner,
it
can
do
virtually
the
same
things.
it
can
say
because
you
engaged
in
prior
strikebreaking,
you
will
never
again
be
admitted
to
membership
in
this
union.
or
it
can
say,
we
will
fine
you
and
until
you
pay
that
fine,
we
will
never
again
admit
you
to
membership
in
this
union
or
it
can
do
as
it
did
in
this
case,
it
can
sue
in
court
to
collect
the
fine.
now
no
one
as
i
understand
it
contests
the
union’s
power
to
debar
the
fellow
who
engaged
in
strikebreaking,
notwithstanding
resignation,
to
fine
him
if
the
sanction
for
enforcement
of
the
fine
is
saying
you
will
pay
or
never
be
readmitted
to
the
union.
the
entire
controversy
centers
here
on
the
court
collectibility
of
the
fine
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
identical
question
which
was
before
the
court
in
allis
chalmers.
the
sole
difference
being
that
in
allis
chalmers
the
worker
retained
his
membership.
here,
he
resigned
in
the
course
of
the
strike
and
our
question
is
whether
we
can
have
a
union
rule
which
says,
if
you
are
a
member
and
the
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
attached
at
the
commencement
of
the
strike,
can
we
require
as
a
conditional
resignation,
you
can
resign.
but
the
one
obligation
you
cannot
shed
by
resignation
is
your
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
for
the
duration
of
the
existing
controversy.
any
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
we
do
not
know
and
we
can
never
know
because
under
the
machinist
constitution
the
decision
whether
or
not
the
go
on
to
a
strike
is
taken
by
secret
ballot.
at
the
time
this
can
--
this
strike
was
called
it
required
a
three-quarters
vote
in
favor
of
the
strike
by
a
secret
ballot
and
the
whole
notion
of
a
secret
ballot
is
that
we
shall
not
know
who
voted
for
or
against
the
strike.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that
your
honor.
well,
no
i
have
to
withdraw
that.
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
most
did.
i
am
not
sure
whether
all
of
them
did.
there
maybe
a
handful
who
returned
to
work
on
the
first
day
of
the
strike,
but
without
checking
the
record
more
closely
that
i
now
have
a
recollection,
i
could
not
say.
but
most
of
them
did
go
out
and
then
resigned
in
the
course
for
the
strike,
but
i
cannot
say
whether
all
participated
in
the
strike.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
it
will
show
when
the
letter
of
resignation
was
sent.
it
may
show
when
it
was
received.
the
board
holds
that
resignation
is
effective
upon
the
union’s
receipt
of
the
letter
of
resignation.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
about
the
operative
facts
namely
that
as
to
a
substantial
number
they’ve
engaged
in
strikebreaking
prior
to
resignation
as
to
a
substantial
number
they
engaged
in
strikebreaking
only
after
their
resignation
was
effective.
now,
we
have
a
preliminary
question
in
this
case
of
the
interpretation
of
the
provision
in
the
union
constitution
barring
strikebreaking.
it
says
that
a
member
shall
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
it
doesn’t
say
what
happens
when
in
the
cause
of
a
strike
a
member
resigns.
you
have
two
ways;
one
has
two
ways
that
one
can
interpret
that
prohibition.
it
can
say
--
one
can
say
that
a
member
is
barred
from
strikebreaking
notwithstanding
resignation
or
one
can
say,
a
member
is
barred
from
strikebreaking
except
following
resignation.
as
between
those
two
interpretations
of
a
union
prohibition
against
strikebreaking
it
seems
to
us
at
least
fair
and
reasonable
to
say,
given
if
the
fact
that
it
is
a
union
prohibition
against
strikebreaking,
given
the
fact
that
the
whole
purpose
of
a
rule
against
strikebreaking
is
to
keep
the
man
from
returning
to
work
during
the
course
of
the
strike
that
the
fair
and
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
rule
is
that
it
means
that
a
member
who
was
a
member
when
the
strike
began
is
required
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
for
the
duration
of
that
controversy.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
suppose
since
the
board
tells
us
that
what
it
is
doing
is
interpreting
a
contract
and
the
conventional
formulation
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
interpretation
of
a
contract
is
supposed
to
be
a
question
of
law
open
to
unrestricted
judicial
review
that
we
are
free
here
to
decide
whether
the
union’s
constitution
is
fairly
and
reasonably
interpreted
to
bar
strikebreaking.
none
of
us
have
focused
on
your
honor's
precise
question,
namely,
given
the
board’s
interpretation
what
is
the
scope
of
judicial
review
with
respect
to
that
interpretation.
and
i
suppose
that
none
of
us
have
focused
on
it
because
the
board
has
never
said
that
this
is
not
a
fair
and
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
union
prohibition.
what
it
has
said
is
that
you
cannot
have
such
an
interpretation.
that
the
union's
authority
over
a
member
is
limited
to
the
time
that
he
was
a
member
and
that
ipso
facto
once
he
resigns
the
union’s
authority
over
him
is
at
an
end.
if
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
way
they
read
any
union
constitution
as
i
read
their
decision,
if
that
is
correct,
one
never
reaches
the
question
of
how
do
you
interpret
this
prohibition,
no
matter
how
reasonably
and
fairly
it
is
interpreted
as
a
matter
of
reading
a
prohibition.
you
cannot
have
that
interpretation
because
there
is
a
superseding
according
to
the
board
rule
of
contract
law
that
the
authority
of
the
union
over
a
member
ceases
on
resignation.
hence
this
rule
even
where
it's
explicit,
as
explicit
as
the
machinist
made
it
in
september
1972,
when
it
amended
this
prohibition
to
state
in
terms,
“resignation
shall
not
relieve
a
member
of
his
obligation
to
refrain
from
accepting
employment
at
the
establishment
for
the
duration
of
the
strike
or
lockout,
if
the
resignation
occurs
during
the
period
of
a
strike
or
lockout
or
within
14
days
preceding
its
commencement.”
that
gives
us
--
no
one
any
problems
of
interpretation.
it
is
now
absolutely
explicit.
as
i
read
the
board’s
decision,
they
would
say
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
you
cannot
have
that
kind
of
a
restriction
because
your
authority
over
the
member
ceases
with
the
resignation.
therefore,
there
can't
be
no
post
resignation
implications
of
continuing
obligation
to
perform
any
part
of
the
union
obligation.
and
it
is
that
on
which
this
litigation
has
centered
as
a
matter
of
how
do
you
read
a
union
constitution.
do
you
say
that
once
resignation
occurs,
every
obligation
ipso
facto
stops,
if
that
is
the
way
you
read
it,
then
our
prohibition
can
not
apply.
mr.
bernard
dunau
which
presents
the
problem,
whether
you
are
--
if
you
are
a
former
member
or
put
it
rather
this
way,
if
during
the
period
of
membership,
if
the
condition
of
acquiring
and
retaining
membership
is
that
on
resignation,
a
particular
obligation
will
--
and
you’re
beyond
your
resignation,
can
that
be
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
beyond
your
membership,
can
a
particular
union
obligation
subsist
beyond
your
membership.
the
board
says,
“no,
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
we
think
that
has
to
be
wrong
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
because
if
that
is
not
wrong
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
we
could
not
in
september
’72
have
amended
our
constitution
to
say
that
following
resignation,
nevertheless
the
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
shall
subsist.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
a
matter
of
how
one
reads
the
relationship
of
a
member
to
a
union,”
it
was
said
as
well
as
i
know
it.
in
section
653
of
the
british
industrial
relations
act
of
1971,
“every
member
of
the
organization
shall
have
the
right
on
giving
reasonable
notice
and
complying
with
any
reasonable
conditions
to
terminate
his
membership
of
the
organization
at
any
time.”
we
are
saying
that
a
reasonable
condition
on
resignation
is
that
a
fellow
who
was
a
member
of
the
union
at
the
time
the
strike
began
shall
for
the
duration
of
that
strike,
respect
his
obligation
that
he
had
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
regardless
of
how
long
the
strike
goes
on
because
the
whole
notion
it
seems
to
us
of
strike
solidarity,
is
that
the
majority
decides
when
to
strike
and
the
majority
decides
when
to
stop
striking
and
that
the
whole
point
of
strike
solidarity
and
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
and
protection
is
that
the
unit
as
a
unit
determines
its
destining
for
good
or
ill,
not
any
individual.
mr.
bernard
dunau
on
a
basis
of
decision
as
we
understand
it
which
said,
“we
reject
that
where
there
is
no
limiting
union
rule.”
we
take
it
to
mean
therefore
that
when
the
court
decided
to
hear
this
case
on
the
resignation
issue,
it
wanted
to
decide
a
question
of
what
do
you
do
when
there
is
an
existing
union
rule
and
that
is
what
they
have
in
this
case.
we
have
a
rule
against
strikebreaking
which
we
think
are
reasonably
and
fairly
interpreted
to
bar
resignation,
not
to
bar
resignation,
to
bar
strikebreaking
by
a
resigner
for
the
duration
of
the
existing
controversy.
what
he
does
in
any
future
controversy,
we
cannot
treat
him
in
any
way
except
as
a
man
on
the
street,
but
when
we
have
a
rule
which
says,
that
for
the
duration
of
an
existing
strike,
he
will
respect
the
obligation
he
undertook
as
a
member,
that
we
think
was
the
question
reserved
in
granite
state,
that
we
think
is
the
question
which
is
presented
here.
and
with
respect
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
make
no
such
distinction,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
it
happens
that
every
member
was
a
member
by
a
choice
because
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
explicitly
stated
that
every
non-member
could
join
or
could
not
join
the
union
has
he
saw
fit.
every
person
on
employment
was
told,
“you
have
free
choice
to
join
or
not
to
join.”
therefore,
everyone
who
joined,
joined
because
he
wanted
membership,
but
that
is
this
case.
we
make
no
distinction
with
respect
to
employees
who
are
required
under
a
union
security
agreement
to
acquire
membership
even
they
are
voluntary
members
in
the
sense
of
being
full
members
because
all
a
union
security
agreement
can
do
is
obligate
the
person
to
pay
his
union
dues
and
initiation
fees.
every
other
obligation
of
membership
is
his
to
acquire
if
he
wants
it,
there
is
no
compulsion
on
him
to
acquire
that
membership.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
the
union
is
willing
to
enforce
against
him
the
obligation
of
the
contract
to
pay
his
dues
and
fees
that
is
the
limit
of
it.
if
the
union
is
willing
to
say,
“okay,
we
will
take
you
only
on
that
basis,”
the
union
can
do
that
or
it
can
say
to
the
fellow,
“you
will
become
a
full
member
or
not
be
a
member
at
all.”
in
that
event,
he
doesn’t
even
pay
union
dues
or
initiation
fees,
but
it
is
his
choice
as
to
whether
he
adopts
the
full
obligations
of
union
membership
or
does
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don’t
know
what
the
usual
phrase
means
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
dunau
so
far
as
the
union
is
concerned
once
they
resign,
subsequent
to
the
termination
of
that
strike
they
are
like
any
other
member
in
the
street
indeed
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
cannot
work
for
that
employer
for
the
duration
of
the
strike.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
was
correct
and
that
is
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
the
precise
difference
your
honor
between
being
a
union
member
subject
to
the
obligations
of
the
union
membership
and
not
being
a
union
member.
mr.
bernard
dunau
he
was
a
former
member
and
the
question
here
is
whether
we
can
bind
a
former
member
for
the
duration
of
a
strike
to
its
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
under
the
machinist
constitution,
it
takes
a
three
quarters
majority
vote
to
call
a
strike.
if
you
want
to
terminate
the
strike,
it
takes
a
majority
votes
of
the
people
who
are
participating
in
the
strike.
that
we
think
is
the
democratic
means
by
which
we
achieve
both
freedom
and
unity,
the
majority
rules.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
your
honor,
it
appears
on
page
138
of
the
record.
a
proposal
to
settle
or
declare
of
an
existing
strike
must
be
presented
at
a
regular
or
called
meeting
of
a
local
lodge
or
a
meeting
of
the
members
affected
as
the
case
maybe
and
decided
by
majority
vote
by
secret
ballot
of
the
members
involved.
now,
the
executive
council
of
the
union,
of
the
international
union
reserves
the
authority
to
discontinue
a
strike
notwithstanding
the
wishes
of
the
employees,
but
their
authority
is
limited
to
say,
“if
we
think
the
strike
should
be
over,
we
will
stop
paying
strike
benefits,
but
they
cannot
otherwise
affect
the
continuation
of
the
strike,”
but
the
men
themselves
can
call
it
off
by
a
majority
vote,
by
secret
ballot.
now,
if
we
are
right,
that
we
can
interpret
our
prohibition
against
strikebreaking
to
pertain,
to
bind
a
member
who
resigns
for
the
duration
of
the
strike
and
if
we
are
right,
that
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
the
association
of
law
–
an
association,
a
labor
organization,
any
voluntary
association
can
reasonably
condition
the
circumstances
under
which
resignation
can
be
a
effectuated.
we
have
only
one
other
question
left
in
this
case.
is
that
the
violation
of
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
for
a
union
expressly
or
impliedly
to
say
that
fellow
who
was
a
member
when
the
strike
begins
will
stay,
will
respect
his
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking?
and
as
to
that
i
think
the
best
place
to
begin
is
the
words
of
the
proviso
themselves.
the
proviso
excludes
from
restraint
or
coercion.
this
paragraph
shall
not
affect
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
and
when
we
say
that
the
condition
of
resignation
is
that
you
will
refrain
from
strikebreaking
for
the
duration
of
the
existing
strike.
that
is
a
rule
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
that
is
all
it
is
and
that
is
the
expressly
reserved
to
the
union
and
carved
out
from
any
notion
of
restraint
or
coercion.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
at
this
point
i
am
placing
it
as
a
matter
of
what
the
statute
allows
us
to
do.
if
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
we
cannot
do
it,
then,
that
is
a
question
of
our
lack
of
authority
under
state
law
to
have
this
kind
of
restriction.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
and
if
one
wants
to
look
it
at
that
way
the
first
question
that
we
have
to
answer
is
do
we
have
with
respect
to
the
contract
between
the
union
and
the
member,
a
contract
which
says
that
the
member
on
resignation
will
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
if
we
have
that
the
next
question
is,
is
there
anything
on
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
bars
that
kind
of
a
contractual
restriction
on
that
kind
of
a
contract?
and
for
us
the
answer
seems
to
be
right
in
the
words
of
the
proviso
namely
that
we
can
prescribe
our
own
rules
with
respect
to
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
it
seems
also
to
us
to
be
quite
in
keeping
with
the
rationale
of
alas
chalmers
with
the
whole
notion
of
union
solidarity
namely
that
the
reason
you
can
collect,
impose
a
court
collectible
fine
against
a
member
for
engaging
in
strikebreaking
is
that
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
maintain
the
cohesion
of
the
union
as
an
effective
organization
as
an
organization
which
can
prosecute
strikes
that
is
the
whole
meaning
of
majority
rule,
centering
your
economic
powers
of
the
majority
controls.
if
in
order
to
further
that
end
we
can
collect,
the
court
collect
--
we
can
impose
a
court
collectible
fine
against
the
member,
what
is
the
difference
in
rationale
in
terms
of
preserving
strikes
solidarity
when
we
are
reaching
out
for
the
defector.
either
case
where
there
is
a
resigner,
a
strikebreaker
or
a
resigner
member,
our
concern
is
identical,
namely
that
a
fellow
who
is
a
member
when
he
starts
out
on
this
enterprise
shall
at
least
respect
his
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
means
that
you
can
resign,
but
that
obligation
of
membership
which
inheres
in
being
a
member
you
cannot
shed.
it’s
the
same
thing
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
are
putting
it
then
the
same
thing
i
think
in
inverse
order.
you
are
free
to
resign
every
obligation
of
membership
except
that
which
inheres
in
respecting
or
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
or
if
one
wants
to
put
it
the
other
way,
if
one
wants
to
say
that
you
cannot
resign
during
a
strike
then
surely
one
can
say
you
can
resign
during
a
strike,
but
you
cannot
shed
that
part
of
your
obligation
which
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
greater
includes
the
less,
if
we
can
say
you
cannot
resign
at
all.
we
can
surely
say,
you
can
resign,
but
you’re
required
to
observe
the
preexisting
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that’s
correct.
if
the
only
thing
that
in
undertaking
to
do
is
to
pay
his
union
dues
and
fees.
he
has
not
undertaken
any
obligation
of
union
membership
and
therefore
we
cannot
enforce
against
him
any
obligation
of
union
membership.
so,
for
the
fellow
who
wants
in
the
words
that
we
used
in
alas
chalmers,
who
wants
to
be
a
limited
member
to
pay
only
dues
and
fees
as
to
that
kind
of
a
fellow,
the
union
has
no
claim
with
respect
to
his
fealty.
he
has
not
undertaken
any
obligation
of
union
membership.
he
can
engage
in
strikebreaking
fairly
well
because
he
has
not
undertaking
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
under
this
contract,
they
have
the
option
not
to
join
at
all.
if
they
join,
they
have
the
option
that
every
member
in
this
country
has
every
employee
to
pay
only
dues
and
fees
and
undertake
no
other
obligation
of
union
membership.
now,
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
to
show
that
every
employee
who
joined
did
not
join
and
become
a
full
member.
but
anyone
who
wants
to
limit
his
obligation,
is
free
under
the
statutes
of
this
country
to
limit
his
obligation.
the
union
in
turn
is
free
to
say,
“sorry,
we
don’t
want
limited
members
in
which
case
that
person
pays
neither
dues
nor
undertakes
any
other
obligation.”
but
if
the
union
says,
“we
want
your
money
but
you
don’t
have
to
have
any
other
obligation
of
membership
that
is
possible.”
what
is
the
obviously
the
most
overwhelming
situation
in
this
country
is
that
the
person
who
pays
his
dues
also
acquires
full
union
membership.
in
that
event,
we
think
he
is
subject
to
entirety
of
union
obligations
and
that
means
we
think
that
for
the
duration
of
an
existing
strike,
he
is
required
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
will
be
delighted
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
doesn’t
open
the
area
your
honor.
the
area
has
been
opened
ever
since
the
unions
have
been
administering
internal
union
discipline.
as
a
matter
of
the
right
of
the
union
member
under
this
constitution
with
the
union
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
every
state
court
in
this
country
has
been
from
the
time
a
union
has
imposed
discipline
and
a
claim
has
been
made
that
the
discipline
has
been
arbitrarily
imposed,
state
courts
have
been
deciding
just
these
questions
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
can’t
say
your
honor,
i
have
no
idea
how
many
got
in.
i
know
one
fact
which
we
ascertain
because
we
wanted
to
know
in
view
of
the
court
of
appeals'
determination
that
not
only
was
the
board
in
this
business,
but
that
you
could
not
have
a
rule
which
eliminate
--
you
could
not
have
them
at
exhaustion,
or
you
could
not
require
the
member
to
exhaust
this
internal
union
remedies.
we
wanted
therefore
to
find
out
how
many
times
in
the
course
of
a
two-year
period
we
have
had
internal
union
appeals.
we
found
out
that
we
had
have
42
internal
union
appeals
of
which
15
pertained
to
strikebreaking
or
picketing
activity
and
that
with
respect
to
those
internal
union
appeals,
we
reversed
about
half
of
what
the
local
laws
did.
so
that
if
the
board
is
in
this
business,
it’s
either
going
to
have
to
decide,
you
don’t
have
to
exhaust
your
internal
union
remedy,
in
which
case
you
throw
away
the
whole
body
of
all
which
we
have
always
taken
for
granted
or
it
decides
you
had
no
excuse
for
not
exhausting
your
remedy
or
you
had
an
excuse
for
exhausting
your
remedy
in
which
case
you’re
completely
within
the
--
into
species
of
internal
union
affairs.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
way
of
considering
an
issue
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
union
fine
without
getting
into
the
internal
business
of
the
union.
well,
if
that’s
what
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
requires,
fine,
that’s
what
it
requires.
so
we’re
required
really
to
confront
the
question,
is
it
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
to
impose
an
unreasonably
large
fine.
now,
there
are
only
two
places
in
this
statute
that
one
can
look
to
for
an
answer
to
that
question.
one,
the
words
restrain
and
coerce.
are
you
restraining
and
coercing
by
imposing
an
unreasonable
fine?
well,
we
know
you
are
not
restraining
and
coercing
when
you
impose
a
reasonable
fine
because
that’s
what
allis-chalmers
was
all
about.
but
what
does
a
reasonable
fine
do?
the
whole
purpose
of
the
reasonable
fine
is
to
compel
a
total
restraint
from
strikebreaking
during
the
cause
of
a
strike.
there
is
no
point
to
a
fine
which
does
not
completely
restrains
strikebreaking.
so,
the
restraint
exist
by
virtue
of
a
reasonable
fine,
you
don’t
add
anymore
restraint
by
making
the
fine
unreasonable.
what
you
do
when
you
say
the
fine
is
unreasonably
large,
is
not
that
it
restraints
or
coerces
any
fine
restraints
or
coerces
and
there
is
not
point
to
what
if
it
doesn’t
restraint
or
coerce.
what
you
say
when
a
fine
is
unreasonable,
if
you
tell
a
man
it’s
$2000,
you’re
going
to
pay
because
you
engaged
in
strikebreaking
and
a
state
court
has
pointed
out
that
this
man
has
got
take
home
pay
of
$50
and
10
children,
no
state
court
is
going
to
enforce
that
fine
because
no
state
court
is
going
to
allow
the
collection
of
a
$2000
fine
against
a
man
who
has
$40
and
take
home
pay
or
a
$100
and
10
children.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
you
are
enforcing
a
rule
against
strikebreaking.
exactly,
the
same
result
you
would
obtain
whether
you
were
enforcing
any
union
rule.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
in
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
between
a
union
and
his
member
part
of
that
constitution
says,
that
a
union
will
not
arbitrarily
impose
discipline
and
unreasonably
large
fine
is
the
arbitrarily
imposition
of
discipline.
it
is
therefore
forbidden
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
bernard
dunau
certainly,
your
honor,
equity.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
suppose
that
most
courts
have
combined
equity
in
lower
courts,
but
i
don’t
care
about
that.
mr.
bernard
dunau
exactly,
your
honor
and
the
whole
purpose
aside
from
saying,
you
can’t
have
any
restraint
or
coercion
out
of
an
unreasonable
fine
that
you
don’t
have
out
of
reasonable
fine
because
the
whole
purpose
of
a
reasonable
fine
is
to
say,
you
will
not
engage
in
strikebreaking.
you
don’t
add
restraint
and
coercion
by
an
unreasonable
fine,
you
go
to
the
proviso.
the
proviso
deliberately
says,
you
will
not
impair
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
now,
what
does
it
mean
to
say,
you
will
be
able
to
prescribe
your
own
rules?
it
means
that
if
you
have
a
rule
and
it’s
violated,
you
can
impose
internal
union
discipline
to
enforce
it
and
that
part
of
the
game
is
no
part
of
the
board’s
business.
mr.
bernard
dunau
let
me
answer
that
question
your
honor
by
telling
the
court
precisely
what
happened
in
david
o'reilly
which
is
the
case
in
which
the
board
said,
it
had
no
power
and
that
has
no
power
because
it’s
not
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
1
(a).
there
were
violations
of
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
all
the
power
in
the
world.
in
the
david
o’
reilly,
the
man
engaged
in
strikebreaking.
he
was
a
member
and
he
remained
a
member
so
we
have
no
resignation
issue
in
that
case.
he
was
fined
$500
for
engaging
in
strikebreaking.
the
fine
of
$500
was
equivalent
to
his
take
home
pay
from
a
strikebreaking
earnings.
so
the
fine
said,
you
are
engaged
in
strikebreaking
violation
of
the
rule,
your
penalty
is
give
up
your
strikebreaking
earnings.
that
case
was
taken
by
the
union
--
the
local
union
there
into
a
california
court
to
seek
a
judgment
to
recover
the
$500
fine.
in
that
court,
the
issue
presented
by
the
employee
the
fine
is
unfair
and
unreasonable.
there
were
two
proceedings
in
nisi
prius
court
in
california
and
two
appeals.
we
finally
got
a
judgment
which
said,
the
fine
for
$500
is
reasonable.
the
judgment
became
final
and
un-appealable
and
it
was
paid.
that
is
the
situation
in
the
state
court.
it
had
a
state
suit
to
collect,
it
had
a
defense
the
fine
was
unreasonable,
it
rejected
defense
the
judgment
was
entered
and
the
judgment
was
satisfied.
what
does
the
labor
board
do
now
with
that
situation?
the
ninth
circuit
says,
go
back
and
determine
reasonableness.
there
are
only
three
alternatives;
one,
the
state
court
had
no
power
to
consider
the
issue
of
reasonableness
because
that
is
preempted
to
the
labor
board.
if
that’s
what
you
have,
you
have
a
totally
impossible
situation.
if
the
question
is
before
the
board,
it
cannot
render
judgments
in
favor
of
the
union
for
the
collection
of
the
fine.
you
want
to
collect
the
fine,
you
have
to
go
to
a
state
court
and
you
tell
you’re
sorry.
the
state
court
has
no
power
to
determine
an
issue
critical
essential
to
your
recovery
of
the
fine.
conceivably
then
what
you
could
have
is
that
first,
you
got
to
determination
out
of
the
board
that
the
fine
is
reasonable
that
will
take
you
five
years
and
then
you’ll
institute
a
suit
in
the
state
court
to
recover
and
then
you’ll
have
additional
defenses
in
the
state
court.
that
makes
no
sense
as
a
matter
of
dealing
with
the
specific
subject.
there
is
an
alternative,
you
can
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
board
can
decide
it,
the
state
court
can
decide
it.
fine,
if
you
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
ordinarily
it
ends
by
the
proceeding,
the
proceeding
which
ends
sooner
and
the
determinative
disposition
by
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata,
that’s
it.
if
that’s
what
we
have,
then
in
the
california
case
the
board
has
no
business
in
it
anymore
because
there
has
been
a
final,
un-appealable,
collective
judgment,
it’s
res
judicata.
so,
whether
the
board
decides
the
issue
or
the
court
will
depend
on
the
happenstance,
the
other
happenstance
of
who’s
proceeding
ends
first
or
you
can
have
it
as
we
think
we
should
have
it.
it’s
a
state
court
matter,
it
was
decided
by
the
state
court
in
david
o’
reilly
that’s
where
it
begins,
that’s
where
it
ends,
that’s
the
way
we
have
been
administering
union
discipline
in
this
country
since
we
had
unions
and
union
discipline.
mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
questions
in
this
case.
one,
where
a
union
rule
prohibits
a
member
from
engaging
in
strike
making
–
strikebreaking,
may
that
rule
be
fairly,
reasonably
and
validly
interpreted
to
require
that
an
employee
who
was
a
member
of
the
union
at
the
time
the
strike
began
is
required
to
observe
the
existing
union
obligation
that
he
had
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
for
the
duration
of
that
strike,
notwithstanding
his
resignation
in
the
midst
of
the
strike.
the
second
question
we
have,
is
whether
the
labor
board
is
empowered
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
size
of
a
union
fine
imposed
against
a
member
for
engaging
in
strikebreaking.
these
two
questions
arise
in
these
circumstances.
boeing
and
booster
lodge
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
expires
on
september
15,
1965.
no
agreement
is
reached.
the
next
day
a
strike
begins.
the
strike
lasts
18
days.
on
october
3,
an
agreement
is
reached,
the
strike
ends.
there
were
1,900
employees
in
the
unit
that
was
struck.
of
these
143
returned
to
work
during
the
course
of
the
strike,
24
never
resigned.
they
retained
their
membership
throughout
the
strike,
but
engaged
in
strikebreaking.
119
did
resign.
of
these
119,
61
returned
to
work
after
their
resignation
and
58
returned
to
work
before
their
resignation.
all,
without
regard
to
whether
they
resigned
or
when
they
returned
to
work,
were
found
guilty
after
internal
union
proceedings
of
having
engaged
in
misconduct
in
violation
of
the
machinist
constitution,
which
defined
as
misconduct
of
a
member
accepting
employment
in
any
capacity
in
an
establishment
where
a
strike
or
lockout
exists
as
recognized
under
this
constitution
without
permission.
those
accused
who
appeared
for
trial
apologized
and
pledged
future
loyalty
to
the
union,
were
in
substance
fined
50%
of
their
strikebreaking
earnings.
what
they
earned
from
the
struck
employer
was
the
measure
of
their
fine,
one-half
was
the
fine.
those
who
did
not
appear
for
trial
and
were
found
guilty,
were
fined
a
flat
sum
of
$450.
this
case
came
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
a
complaint
which
alleged
that
the
imposition
of
the
fines
which
were
court
collectible,
the
union
sought,
threatened
to
institute
court
proceedings
and
did
institute
court
proceedings
to
collect
these
fines.
the
claim
before
the
board
was
that
the
imposition
of
the
fines
constituted
restraint
and
coercion
of
the
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
refrain
from
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
the
claim
is
divided
into
two
parts.
as
to
those
employees
who
never
resigned
and
as
to
those
employees
who
resigned,
but
engaged
in
strikebreaking
prior
to
the
resignation.
it
was
said
that
the
restraint
and
coercion
resided
in
the
unreasonableness
of
the
size
of
the
fine.
it
was
too
large
and
therefore
it
was
restraint
or
coercion.
the
board
dismissed
that
part
of
the
complaint.
it
said
given
the
validity
of
the
union
rule
against
strikebreaking,
the
size
of
the
fine
was
not
its
business.
it
was
the
business
of
a
state
court
on
a
suit
to
collect
or
set
aside
that
fine,
the
state
court
would
decide
whether
or
not
the
fine
was
too
large.
as
to
second
claim,
the
complaint
alleged
that
those
who
engaged
in
post
resignation
strikebreaking,
no
fine
in
any
amount
could
be
levied
against
them
and
so
the
restraint
and
coercion
with
respect
to
people
who
were
engaged
in
post
resignation
strikebreaking
was
that
any
internal
union
discipline
by
way
of
a
court
collectible
fine
was
of
itself
restraint
and
coercion.
the
board
held
that
it
was,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that
determination.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
board’s
determination
that
it
had
no
power
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
a
fine
and
both
questions
are
here
on
the
union’s
petition
and
the
reasonableness
of
fine
issue
on
the
board’s
petition
as
well.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
with
respect
to
a
person
who
did
not
resign,
the
union
can
do
a
number
of
things.
it
can
expel
him.
it
can
fine
him
and
say
that
the
penalty
or
the
sanction
for
not
paying
the
fine
will
be
expulsion
or
it
can
do
as
it
did
in
allis
chalmers
and
was
validated
in
allis
chalmers,
it
can
sue
in
court
for
the
collection
of
the
fine.
with
respect
to
a
resigner,
it
can
do
virtually
the
same
things.
it
can
say
because
you
engaged
in
prior
strikebreaking,
you
will
never
again
be
admitted
to
membership
in
this
union.
or
it
can
say,
we
will
fine
you
and
until
you
pay
that
fine,
we
will
never
again
admit
you
to
membership
in
this
union
or
it
can
do
as
it
did
in
this
case,
it
can
sue
in
court
to
collect
the
fine.
now
no
one
as
i
understand
it
contests
the
union’s
power
to
debar
the
fellow
who
engaged
in
strikebreaking,
notwithstanding
resignation,
to
fine
him
if
the
sanction
for
enforcement
of
the
fine
is
saying
you
will
pay
or
never
be
readmitted
to
the
union.
the
entire
controversy
centers
here
on
the
court
collectibility
of
the
fine
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
identical
question
which
was
before
the
court
in
allis
chalmers.
the
sole
difference
being
that
in
allis
chalmers
the
worker
retained
his
membership.
here,
he
resigned
in
the
course
of
the
strike
and
our
question
is
whether
we
can
have
a
union
rule
which
says,
if
you
are
a
member
and
the
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
attached
at
the
commencement
of
the
strike,
can
we
require
as
a
conditional
resignation,
you
can
resign.
but
the
one
obligation
you
cannot
shed
by
resignation
is
your
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
for
the
duration
of
the
existing
controversy.
any
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
we
do
not
know
and
we
can
never
know
because
under
the
machinist
constitution
the
decision
whether
or
not
the
go
on
to
a
strike
is
taken
by
secret
ballot.
at
the
time
this
can
--
this
strike
was
called
it
required
a
three-quarters
vote
in
favor
of
the
strike
by
a
secret
ballot
and
the
whole
notion
of
a
secret
ballot
is
that
we
shall
not
know
who
voted
for
or
against
the
strike.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that
your
honor.
well,
no
i
have
to
withdraw
that.
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
most
did.
i
am
not
sure
whether
all
of
them
did.
there
maybe
a
handful
who
returned
to
work
on
the
first
day
of
the
strike,
but
without
checking
the
record
more
closely
that
i
now
have
a
recollection,
i
could
not
say.
but
most
of
them
did
go
out
and
then
resigned
in
the
course
for
the
strike,
but
i
cannot
say
whether
all
participated
in
the
strike.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
it
will
show
when
the
letter
of
resignation
was
sent.
it
may
show
when
it
was
received.
the
board
holds
that
resignation
is
effective
upon
the
union’s
receipt
of
the
letter
of
resignation.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
about
the
operative
facts
namely
that
as
to
a
substantial
number
they’ve
engaged
in
strikebreaking
prior
to
resignation
as
to
a
substantial
number
they
engaged
in
strikebreaking
only
after
their
resignation
was
effective.
now,
we
have
a
preliminary
question
in
this
case
of
the
interpretation
of
the
provision
in
the
union
constitution
barring
strikebreaking.
it
says
that
a
member
shall
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
it
doesn’t
say
what
happens
when
in
the
cause
of
a
strike
a
member
resigns.
you
have
two
ways;
one
has
two
ways
that
one
can
interpret
that
prohibition.
it
can
say
--
one
can
say
that
a
member
is
barred
from
strikebreaking
notwithstanding
resignation
or
one
can
say,
a
member
is
barred
from
strikebreaking
except
following
resignation.
as
between
those
two
interpretations
of
a
union
prohibition
against
strikebreaking
it
seems
to
us
at
least
fair
and
reasonable
to
say,
given
if
the
fact
that
it
is
a
union
prohibition
against
strikebreaking,
given
the
fact
that
the
whole
purpose
of
a
rule
against
strikebreaking
is
to
keep
the
man
from
returning
to
work
during
the
course
of
the
strike
that
the
fair
and
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
rule
is
that
it
means
that
a
member
who
was
a
member
when
the
strike
began
is
required
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
for
the
duration
of
that
controversy.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
suppose
since
the
board
tells
us
that
what
it
is
doing
is
interpreting
a
contract
and
the
conventional
formulation
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
interpretation
of
a
contract
is
supposed
to
be
a
question
of
law
open
to
unrestricted
judicial
review
that
we
are
free
here
to
decide
whether
the
union’s
constitution
is
fairly
and
reasonably
interpreted
to
bar
strikebreaking.
none
of
us
have
focused
on
your
honor's
precise
question,
namely,
given
the
board’s
interpretation
what
is
the
scope
of
judicial
review
with
respect
to
that
interpretation.
and
i
suppose
that
none
of
us
have
focused
on
it
because
the
board
has
never
said
that
this
is
not
a
fair
and
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
union
prohibition.
what
it
has
said
is
that
you
cannot
have
such
an
interpretation.
that
the
union's
authority
over
a
member
is
limited
to
the
time
that
he
was
a
member
and
that
ipso
facto
once
he
resigns
the
union’s
authority
over
him
is
at
an
end.
if
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
way
they
read
any
union
constitution
as
i
read
their
decision,
if
that
is
correct,
one
never
reaches
the
question
of
how
do
you
interpret
this
prohibition,
no
matter
how
reasonably
and
fairly
it
is
interpreted
as
a
matter
of
reading
a
prohibition.
you
cannot
have
that
interpretation
because
there
is
a
superseding
according
to
the
board
rule
of
contract
law
that
the
authority
of
the
union
over
a
member
ceases
on
resignation.
hence
this
rule
even
where
it's
explicit,
as
explicit
as
the
machinist
made
it
in
september
1972,
when
it
amended
this
prohibition
to
state
in
terms,
“resignation
shall
not
relieve
a
member
of
his
obligation
to
refrain
from
accepting
employment
at
the
establishment
for
the
duration
of
the
strike
or
lockout,
if
the
resignation
occurs
during
the
period
of
a
strike
or
lockout
or
within
14
days
preceding
its
commencement.”
that
gives
us
--
no
one
any
problems
of
interpretation.
it
is
now
absolutely
explicit.
as
i
read
the
board’s
decision,
they
would
say
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
you
cannot
have
that
kind
of
a
restriction
because
your
authority
over
the
member
ceases
with
the
resignation.
therefore,
there
can't
be
no
post
resignation
implications
of
continuing
obligation
to
perform
any
part
of
the
union
obligation.
and
it
is
that
on
which
this
litigation
has
centered
as
a
matter
of
how
do
you
read
a
union
constitution.
do
you
say
that
once
resignation
occurs,
every
obligation
ipso
facto
stops,
if
that
is
the
way
you
read
it,
then
our
prohibition
can
not
apply.
mr.
bernard
dunau
which
presents
the
problem,
whether
you
are
--
if
you
are
a
former
member
or
put
it
rather
this
way,
if
during
the
period
of
membership,
if
the
condition
of
acquiring
and
retaining
membership
is
that
on
resignation,
a
particular
obligation
will
--
and
you’re
beyond
your
resignation,
can
that
be
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
beyond
your
membership,
can
a
particular
union
obligation
subsist
beyond
your
membership.
the
board
says,
“no,
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
we
think
that
has
to
be
wrong
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
because
if
that
is
not
wrong
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
we
could
not
in
september
’72
have
amended
our
constitution
to
say
that
following
resignation,
nevertheless
the
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
shall
subsist.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
a
matter
of
how
one
reads
the
relationship
of
a
member
to
a
union,”
it
was
said
as
well
as
i
know
it.
in
section
653
of
the
british
industrial
relations
act
of
1971,
“every
member
of
the
organization
shall
have
the
right
on
giving
reasonable
notice
and
complying
with
any
reasonable
conditions
to
terminate
his
membership
of
the
organization
at
any
time.”
we
are
saying
that
a
reasonable
condition
on
resignation
is
that
a
fellow
who
was
a
member
of
the
union
at
the
time
the
strike
began
shall
for
the
duration
of
that
strike,
respect
his
obligation
that
he
had
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
regardless
of
how
long
the
strike
goes
on
because
the
whole
notion
it
seems
to
us
of
strike
solidarity,
is
that
the
majority
decides
when
to
strike
and
the
majority
decides
when
to
stop
striking
and
that
the
whole
point
of
strike
solidarity
and
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
and
protection
is
that
the
unit
as
a
unit
determines
its
destining
for
good
or
ill,
not
any
individual.
mr.
bernard
dunau
on
a
basis
of
decision
as
we
understand
it
which
said,
“we
reject
that
where
there
is
no
limiting
union
rule.”
we
take
it
to
mean
therefore
that
when
the
court
decided
to
hear
this
case
on
the
resignation
issue,
it
wanted
to
decide
a
question
of
what
do
you
do
when
there
is
an
existing
union
rule
and
that
is
what
they
have
in
this
case.
we
have
a
rule
against
strikebreaking
which
we
think
are
reasonably
and
fairly
interpreted
to
bar
resignation,
not
to
bar
resignation,
to
bar
strikebreaking
by
a
resigner
for
the
duration
of
the
existing
controversy.
what
he
does
in
any
future
controversy,
we
cannot
treat
him
in
any
way
except
as
a
man
on
the
street,
but
when
we
have
a
rule
which
says,
that
for
the
duration
of
an
existing
strike,
he
will
respect
the
obligation
he
undertook
as
a
member,
that
we
think
was
the
question
reserved
in
granite
state,
that
we
think
is
the
question
which
is
presented
here.
and
with
respect
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
make
no
such
distinction,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
it
happens
that
every
member
was
a
member
by
a
choice
because
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
explicitly
stated
that
every
non-member
could
join
or
could
not
join
the
union
has
he
saw
fit.
every
person
on
employment
was
told,
“you
have
free
choice
to
join
or
not
to
join.”
therefore,
everyone
who
joined,
joined
because
he
wanted
membership,
but
that
is
this
case.
we
make
no
distinction
with
respect
to
employees
who
are
required
under
a
union
security
agreement
to
acquire
membership
even
they
are
voluntary
members
in
the
sense
of
being
full
members
because
all
a
union
security
agreement
can
do
is
obligate
the
person
to
pay
his
union
dues
and
initiation
fees.
every
other
obligation
of
membership
is
his
to
acquire
if
he
wants
it,
there
is
no
compulsion
on
him
to
acquire
that
membership.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
the
union
is
willing
to
enforce
against
him
the
obligation
of
the
contract
to
pay
his
dues
and
fees
that
is
the
limit
of
it.
if
the
union
is
willing
to
say,
“okay,
we
will
take
you
only
on
that
basis,”
the
union
can
do
that
or
it
can
say
to
the
fellow,
“you
will
become
a
full
member
or
not
be
a
member
at
all.”
in
that
event,
he
doesn’t
even
pay
union
dues
or
initiation
fees,
but
it
is
his
choice
as
to
whether
he
adopts
the
full
obligations
of
union
membership
or
does
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don’t
know
what
the
usual
phrase
means
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
dunau
so
far
as
the
union
is
concerned
once
they
resign,
subsequent
to
the
termination
of
that
strike
they
are
like
any
other
member
in
the
street
indeed
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
cannot
work
for
that
employer
for
the
duration
of
the
strike.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
was
correct
and
that
is
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
the
precise
difference
your
honor
between
being
a
union
member
subject
to
the
obligations
of
the
union
membership
and
not
being
a
union
member.
mr.
bernard
dunau
he
was
a
former
member
and
the
question
here
is
whether
we
can
bind
a
former
member
for
the
duration
of
a
strike
to
its
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
under
the
machinist
constitution,
it
takes
a
three
quarters
majority
vote
to
call
a
strike.
if
you
want
to
terminate
the
strike,
it
takes
a
majority
votes
of
the
people
who
are
participating
in
the
strike.
that
we
think
is
the
democratic
means
by
which
we
achieve
both
freedom
and
unity,
the
majority
rules.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
your
honor,
it
appears
on
page
138
of
the
record.
a
proposal
to
settle
or
declare
of
an
existing
strike
must
be
presented
at
a
regular
or
called
meeting
of
a
local
lodge
or
a
meeting
of
the
members
affected
as
the
case
maybe
and
decided
by
majority
vote
by
secret
ballot
of
the
members
involved.
now,
the
executive
council
of
the
union,
of
the
international
union
reserves
the
authority
to
discontinue
a
strike
notwithstanding
the
wishes
of
the
employees,
but
their
authority
is
limited
to
say,
“if
we
think
the
strike
should
be
over,
we
will
stop
paying
strike
benefits,
but
they
cannot
otherwise
affect
the
continuation
of
the
strike,”
but
the
men
themselves
can
call
it
off
by
a
majority
vote,
by
secret
ballot.
now,
if
we
are
right,
that
we
can
interpret
our
prohibition
against
strikebreaking
to
pertain,
to
bind
a
member
who
resigns
for
the
duration
of
the
strike
and
if
we
are
right,
that
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
the
association
of
law
–
an
association,
a
labor
organization,
any
voluntary
association
can
reasonably
condition
the
circumstances
under
which
resignation
can
be
a
effectuated.
we
have
only
one
other
question
left
in
this
case.
is
that
the
violation
of
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
for
a
union
expressly
or
impliedly
to
say
that
fellow
who
was
a
member
when
the
strike
begins
will
stay,
will
respect
his
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking?
and
as
to
that
i
think
the
best
place
to
begin
is
the
words
of
the
proviso
themselves.
the
proviso
excludes
from
restraint
or
coercion.
this
paragraph
shall
not
affect
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
and
when
we
say
that
the
condition
of
resignation
is
that
you
will
refrain
from
strikebreaking
for
the
duration
of
the
existing
strike.
that
is
a
rule
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
that
is
all
it
is
and
that
is
the
expressly
reserved
to
the
union
and
carved
out
from
any
notion
of
restraint
or
coercion.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
at
this
point
i
am
placing
it
as
a
matter
of
what
the
statute
allows
us
to
do.
if
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
we
cannot
do
it,
then,
that
is
a
question
of
our
lack
of
authority
under
state
law
to
have
this
kind
of
restriction.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
and
if
one
wants
to
look
it
at
that
way
the
first
question
that
we
have
to
answer
is
do
we
have
with
respect
to
the
contract
between
the
union
and
the
member,
a
contract
which
says
that
the
member
on
resignation
will
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
if
we
have
that
the
next
question
is,
is
there
anything
on
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
bars
that
kind
of
a
contractual
restriction
on
that
kind
of
a
contract?
and
for
us
the
answer
seems
to
be
right
in
the
words
of
the
proviso
namely
that
we
can
prescribe
our
own
rules
with
respect
to
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
it
seems
also
to
us
to
be
quite
in
keeping
with
the
rationale
of
alas
chalmers
with
the
whole
notion
of
union
solidarity
namely
that
the
reason
you
can
collect,
impose
a
court
collectible
fine
against
a
member
for
engaging
in
strikebreaking
is
that
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
maintain
the
cohesion
of
the
union
as
an
effective
organization
as
an
organization
which
can
prosecute
strikes
that
is
the
whole
meaning
of
majority
rule,
centering
your
economic
powers
of
the
majority
controls.
if
in
order
to
further
that
end
we
can
collect,
the
court
collect
--
we
can
impose
a
court
collectible
fine
against
the
member,
what
is
the
difference
in
rationale
in
terms
of
preserving
strikes
solidarity
when
we
are
reaching
out
for
the
defector.
either
case
where
there
is
a
resigner,
a
strikebreaker
or
a
resigner
member,
our
concern
is
identical,
namely
that
a
fellow
who
is
a
member
when
he
starts
out
on
this
enterprise
shall
at
least
respect
his
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
means
that
you
can
resign,
but
that
obligation
of
membership
which
inheres
in
being
a
member
you
cannot
shed.
it’s
the
same
thing
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
are
putting
it
then
the
same
thing
i
think
in
inverse
order.
you
are
free
to
resign
every
obligation
of
membership
except
that
which
inheres
in
respecting
or
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking
or
if
one
wants
to
put
it
the
other
way,
if
one
wants
to
say
that
you
cannot
resign
during
a
strike
then
surely
one
can
say
you
can
resign
during
a
strike,
but
you
cannot
shed
that
part
of
your
obligation
which
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
greater
includes
the
less,
if
we
can
say
you
cannot
resign
at
all.
we
can
surely
say,
you
can
resign,
but
you’re
required
to
observe
the
preexisting
obligation
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that’s
correct.
if
the
only
thing
that
in
undertaking
to
do
is
to
pay
his
union
dues
and
fees.
he
has
not
undertaken
any
obligation
of
union
membership
and
therefore
we
cannot
enforce
against
him
any
obligation
of
union
membership.
so,
for
the
fellow
who
wants
in
the
words
that
we
used
in
alas
chalmers,
who
wants
to
be
a
limited
member
to
pay
only
dues
and
fees
as
to
that
kind
of
a
fellow,
the
union
has
no
claim
with
respect
to
his
fealty.
he
has
not
undertaken
any
obligation
of
union
membership.
he
can
engage
in
strikebreaking
fairly
well
because
he
has
not
undertaking
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
under
this
contract,
they
have
the
option
not
to
join
at
all.
if
they
join,
they
have
the
option
that
every
member
in
this
country
has
every
employee
to
pay
only
dues
and
fees
and
undertake
no
other
obligation
of
union
membership.
now,
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
to
show
that
every
employee
who
joined
did
not
join
and
become
a
full
member.
but
anyone
who
wants
to
limit
his
obligation,
is
free
under
the
statutes
of
this
country
to
limit
his
obligation.
the
union
in
turn
is
free
to
say,
“sorry,
we
don’t
want
limited
members
in
which
case
that
person
pays
neither
dues
nor
undertakes
any
other
obligation.”
but
if
the
union
says,
“we
want
your
money
but
you
don’t
have
to
have
any
other
obligation
of
membership
that
is
possible.”
what
is
the
obviously
the
most
overwhelming
situation
in
this
country
is
that
the
person
who
pays
his
dues
also
acquires
full
union
membership.
in
that
event,
we
think
he
is
subject
to
entirety
of
union
obligations
and
that
means
we
think
that
for
the
duration
of
an
existing
strike,
he
is
required
to
refrain
from
strikebreaking.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
will
be
delighted
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
doesn’t
open
the
area
your
honor.
the
area
has
been
opened
ever
since
the
unions
have
been
administering
internal
union
discipline.
as
a
matter
of
the
right
of
the
union
member
under
this
constitution
with
the
union
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
every
state
court
in
this
country
has
been
from
the
time
a
union
has
imposed
discipline
and
a
claim
has
been
made
that
the
discipline
has
been
arbitrarily
imposed,
state
courts
have
been
deciding
just
these
questions
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
can’t
say
your
honor,
i
have
no
idea
how
many
got
in.
i
know
one
fact
which
we
ascertain
because
we
wanted
to
know
in
view
of
the
court
of
appeals'
determination
that
not
only
was
the
board
in
this
business,
but
that
you
could
not
have
a
rule
which
eliminate
--
you
could
not
have
them
at
exhaustion,
or
you
could
not
require
the
member
to
exhaust
this
internal
union
remedies.
we
wanted
therefore
to
find
out
how
many
times
in
the
course
of
a
two-year
period
we
have
had
internal
union
appeals.
we
found
out
that
we
had
have
42
internal
union
appeals
of
which
15
pertained
to
strikebreaking
or
picketing
activity
and
that
with
respect
to
those
internal
union
appeals,
we
reversed
about
half
of
what
the
local
laws
did.
so
that
if
the
board
is
in
this
business,
it’s
either
going
to
have
to
decide,
you
don’t
have
to
exhaust
your
internal
union
remedy,
in
which
case
you
throw
away
the
whole
body
of
all
which
we
have
always
taken
for
granted
or
it
decides
you
had
no
excuse
for
not
exhausting
your
remedy
or
you
had
an
excuse
for
exhausting
your
remedy
in
which
case
you’re
completely
within
the
--
into
species
of
internal
union
affairs.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
way
of
considering
an
issue
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
union
fine
without
getting
into
the
internal
business
of
the
union.
well,
if
that’s
what
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
requires,
fine,
that’s
what
it
requires.
so
we’re
required
really
to
confront
the
question,
is
it
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
to
impose
an
unreasonably
large
fine.
now,
there
are
only
two
places
in
this
statute
that
one
can
look
to
for
an
answer
to
that
question.
one,
the
words
restrain
and
coerce.
are
you
restraining
and
coercing
by
imposing
an
unreasonable
fine?
well,
we
know
you
are
not
restraining
and
coercing
when
you
impose
a
reasonable
fine
because
that’s
what
allis-chalmers
was
all
about.
but
what
does
a
reasonable
fine
do?
the
whole
purpose
of
the
reasonable
fine
is
to
compel
a
total
restraint
from
strikebreaking
during
the
cause
of
a
strike.
there
is
no
point
to
a
fine
which
does
not
completely
restrains
strikebreaking.
so,
the
restraint
exist
by
virtue
of
a
reasonable
fine,
you
don’t
add
anymore
restraint
by
making
the
fine
unreasonable.
what
you
do
when
you
say
the
fine
is
unreasonably
large,
is
not
that
it
restraints
or
coerces
any
fine
restraints
or
coerces
and
there
is
not
point
to
what
if
it
doesn’t
restraint
or
coerce.
what
you
say
when
a
fine
is
unreasonable,
if
you
tell
a
man
it’s
$2000,
you’re
going
to
pay
because
you
engaged
in
strikebreaking
and
a
state
court
has
pointed
out
that
this
man
has
got
take
home
pay
of
$50
and
10
children,
no
state
court
is
going
to
enforce
that
fine
because
no
state
court
is
going
to
allow
the
collection
of
a
$2000
fine
against
a
man
who
has
$40
and
take
home
pay
or
a
$100
and
10
children.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
you
are
enforcing
a
rule
against
strikebreaking.
exactly,
the
same
result
you
would
obtain
whether
you
were
enforcing
any
union
rule.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
in
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
between
a
union
and
his
member
part
of
that
constitution
says,
that
a
union
will
not
arbitrarily
impose
discipline
and
unreasonably
large
fine
is
the
arbitrarily
imposition
of
discipline.
it
is
therefore
forbidden
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
bernard
dunau
certainly,
your
honor,
equity.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
suppose
that
most
courts
have
combined
equity
in
lower
courts,
but
i
don’t
care
about
that.
mr.
bernard
dunau
exactly,
your
honor
and
the
whole
purpose
aside
from
saying,
you
can’t
have
any
restraint
or
coercion
out
of
an
unreasonable
fine
that
you
don’t
have
out
of
reasonable
fine
because
the
whole
purpose
of
a
reasonable
fine
is
to
say,
you
will
not
engage
in
strikebreaking.
you
don’t
add
restraint
and
coercion
by
an
unreasonable
fine,
you
go
to
the
proviso.
the
proviso
deliberately
says,
you
will
not
impair
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
now,
what
does
it
mean
to
say,
you
will
be
able
to
prescribe
your
own
rules?
it
means
that
if
you
have
a
rule
and
it’s
violated,
you
can
impose
internal
union
discipline
to
enforce
it
and
that
part
of
the
game
is
no
part
of
the
board’s
business.
mr.
bernard
dunau
let
me
answer
that
question
your
honor
by
telling
the
court
precisely
what
happened
in
david
o'reilly
which
is
the
case
in
which
the
board
said,
it
had
no
power
and
that
has
no
power
because
it’s
not
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
1
(a).
there
were
violations
of
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
all
the
power
in
the
world.
in
the
david
o’
reilly,
the
man
engaged
in
strikebreaking.
he
was
a
member
and
he
remained
a
member
so
we
have
no
resignation
issue
in
that
case.
he
was
fined
$500
for
engaging
in
strikebreaking.
the
fine
of
$500
was
equivalent
to
his
take
home
pay
from
a
strikebreaking
earnings.
so
the
fine
said,
you
are
engaged
in
strikebreaking
violation
of
the
rule,
your
penalty
is
give
up
your
strikebreaking
earnings.
that
case
was
taken
by
the
union
--
the
local
union
there
into
a
california
court
to
seek
a
judgment
to
recover
the
$500
fine.
in
that
court,
the
issue
presented
by
the
employee
the
fine
is
unfair
and
unreasonable.
there
were
two
proceedings
in
nisi
prius
court
in
california
and
two
appeals.
we
finally
got
a
judgment
which
said,
the
fine
for
$500
is
reasonable.
the
judgment
became
final
and
un-appealable
and
it
was
paid.
that
is
the
situation
in
the
state
court.
it
had
a
state
suit
to
collect,
it
had
a
defense
the
fine
was
unreasonable,
it
rejected
defense
the
judgment
was
entered
and
the
judgment
was
satisfied.
what
does
the
labor
board
do
now
with
that
situation?
the
ninth
circuit
says,
go
back
and
determine
reasonableness.
there
are
only
three
alternatives;
one,
the
state
court
had
no
power
to
consider
the
issue
of
reasonableness
because
that
is
preempted
to
the
labor
board.
if
that’s
what
you
have,
you
have
a
totally
impossible
situation.
if
the
question
is
before
the
board,
it
cannot
render
judgments
in
favor
of
the
union
for
the
collection
of
the
fine.
you
want
to
collect
the
fine,
you
have
to
go
to
a
state
court
and
you
tell
you’re
sorry.
the
state
court
has
no
power
to
determine
an
issue
critical
essential
to
your
recovery
of
the
fine.
conceivably
then
what
you
could
have
is
that
first,
you
got
to
determination
out
of
the
board
that
the
fine
is
reasonable
that
will
take
you
five
years
and
then
you’ll
institute
a
suit
in
the
state
court
to
recover
and
then
you’ll
have
additional
defenses
in
the
state
court.
that
makes
no
sense
as
a
matter
of
dealing
with
the
specific
subject.
there
is
an
alternative,
you
can
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
board
can
decide
it,
the
state
court
can
decide
it.
fine,
if
you
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
ordinarily
it
ends
by
the
proceeding,
the
proceeding
which
ends
sooner
and
the
determinative
disposition
by
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata,
that’s
it.
if
that’s
what
we
have,
then
in
the
california
case
the
board
has
no
business
in
it
anymore
because
there
has
been
a
final,
un-appealable,
collective
judgment,
it’s
res
judicata.
so,
whether
the
board
decides
the
issue
or
the
court
will
depend
on
the
happenstance,
the
other
happenstance
of
who’s
proceeding
ends
first
or
you
can
have
it
as
we
think
we
should
have
it.
it’s
a
state
court
matter,
it
was
decided
by
the
state
court
in
david
o’
reilly
that’s
where
it
begins,
that’s
where
it
ends,
that’s
the
way
we
have
been
administering
union
discipline
in
this
country
since
we
had
unions
and
union
discipline.
