mr.
thomas
e.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
filed
this
suit
and
have
been
involved
with
it
since
very
inception.
there
existed
at
that
time
in
georgia
three
basic
types
of
procedure,
one
was
strictly
civil,
one
was
strictly
criminal,
and
one
was
civil
leading
toward
the
criminal
process.
now,
before
i
was
in
office
in
this
particular
case,
the
solicitor
traveled
the
criminal
route.
he
was
stopped
in
gable
versus
jenkins
and
the
federal
district
court
says
“no,
you
must
first
have
a
prior
adversary
hearing
before
seizing
the
material.”
and
therefore,
we
started
the
civil
proceedings
as
a
prior
adversary
proceeding
leading
to
the
seizure
of
the
film
for
criminal
prosecution
purposes.
i
might
add
at
this
juncture,
that
this
is
not
anyhow
imposed
upon
us.
the
federal
court
says
there
they
were
mixing
the
apples
and
oranges,
civil
and
criminal
procedure.
and
it
complicated
matters
and
as
long
as
the
court
would
stick
with
the
civil
process
on
the
one
hand
and
the
absolute
criminal
process
on
the
other,
we
had
a
clear
and
defined
area,
that
the
criminal
process
would
inherit
it,
grant
to
the
person
a
far
greater
protection
than
any
civil
injunction
could
grant.
nevertheless,
the
outline
or
the
method
of
using
an
injunction
was
suggested
indeed.
then
we
started
that
process,
and
a
petition
was
filed
alleging
that
the
film
in
this
case
was
obscene,
setting
out
a
factual
description
of
the
film.
we
showed
it
was
being
exhibited
to
the
general
public
on
a
fee
basis.
we
asked
the
court
to
restrain
and
enjoin
them
from
further
showing
the
film.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
i
believe
at
the
recess
we
were
at
the
point
concerning
the
procedure
employed
in
this
particular
case
in
the
state
of
georgia.
the
petition
as
it
was
served
upon
the
defendants
at
that
time,
did
not
restrain
the
showing
of
the
film,
did
not
in
anyway
interfere
with
the
showing
of
the
film.
it
simply
restrained
and
enjoined
them
temporarily
from
removing
the
film
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
a
hearing
was
then
set
immediately
thereafter.
from
that
juncture
it
is
entirely
up
to
the
exhibitor
whether
he
wants
a
hearing
or
whether
the
state
will
press
forward
at
that
time,
which
we
generally
do.
any
continuance
is
on
the
behalf
of
the
exhibitor.
in
the
meantime,
he
can
continue
to
show
the
file.
then
after
an
adversary
hearing
and
i
might
add
to
our
opposing
counsel
i
would
mention
this
to
the
court
that
the
film
was
produced
by
counsel
wrapped
in
a
christmas
package
and
which
the
court
graciously
accepted
it
in
a
manner
it
was
tended.
the
film
was
shown
and
the
court
in
this
case
did
not
render
decision
for
quite
sometime.
there
was
still
no
injunction
whatsoever
about
showing
of
the
film.
unlike
most
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
no
sir,
it
was
kept
as
evidence
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
they
could
do
so.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
i
do
not
know
sir.
but
that
was
a
procedure
imposed
on
us
by
the
federal
judiciary
in
georgia.
i
might
point
this
out
at
this
juncture
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir,
after
a
hearing.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
there
was
no
prohibition
about
exhibiting
the
film.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
no
sir.
we
do
not
use
this
procedure
anymore
and
we
only
used
it
then
because
it
was
imposed
upon
us.
we
resisted
it
then
and
we
resist
it
now.
for
you
see,
unlike
most
states
since
1877,
georgia
enacted
a
constitutional
provision
which
reads
“liberty
of
speech
or
of
the
press
guarantee,
no
law
shall
ever
be
passed
to
curtail
or
restrain
the
liberty
of
speech
or
of
the
press.
any
person
may
speak
right
and
publish
his
sentiments
on
all
subjects
being
responsible
for
the
abuse
of
that
liberty.”
now
on
that
statute
or
because
of
that
statute,
i
personally
filed
suit
in
k.
gordon
murray
productions
versus
floyd
and
challenged
the
censorship
ordinances
in
the
city
of
atlanta,
georgia
in
1962.
the
ordinances
i
contended
then
were
infected
with
the
vice
in
teitel
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
declared
it
unconstitutional,
as
abridging
this
particular
provision.
and
said
that
they
could
show
what
they
please
but
they
are
going
to
be
responsible
for
that
to
show
and
if
it
amounts
to
criminal
acts
in
nature
they
can
be
punished
for
the
criminal
acts
in
nature,
just
as
you
can
have
a
gun
legitimately
on
person
and
that’s
all
right
or
in
your
home,
but
if
you
use
that
gun
for
an
illegal
purpose
that
is
something
else
again
and
that
is
a
procedure
that
we
adopted
in
the
state
of
georgia.
i
might
add
that
in
just
passing
that
references
made
to
oregon,
now
why
i
believe
reducing
the
standards
of
obscenity
or
abolishing
it
all
together.
that
i
say
is
well
and
good,
if
that’s
what
the
state
there
wants.
this
is
a
legislative
problem
we
are
coping
with
and
not
as
we
contend
a
judicial
problem.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
in
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
we
would
proceed
under
search
warrant,
and
proceed
criminally,
and
make
the
arrest,
have
the
commitment
hearing
which
we
are
required
to
do
in
the
matter
of
24
to
48
hours
and
have
every
criminal
--
a
protection
of
any
person
accused
of
crime,
there
could
be
no
destruction.
the
only
difference
in
civil
process
strictly
civil
and
strictly
criminal
where
that
be
body
of
intertwine
is
that
in
the
civil
process
is
for
the
purpose
of
seizure
and
destruction.
in
a
criminal
process,
its
seizure
for
the
purpose
of
evidence.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes,
a
factual
affidavit
now.
not
one
just
to
say
that
i
saw
a
film
but
it’s
obscene.
it
has
to
start
off
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
--
exactly
as
the
film
is
described
in
this
brief
and
that’s
the
factual
basis
upon
which
they
are
now
issued,
and
let
the
magistrate
himself
determine
it.
and
that
is
why
we
have
made
no
effort
to
school
the
police
officer
in
the
field
of
pornography
and
we
don’t
want
his
extra
judicial
opinion.
what
we
want
to
know
is
an
affidavit
of
what
you
saw
and
where
you
saw
and
when
you
saw
and
let
the
justice
take
it
from
there.
the
motion
picture
films
here
i
think
speak
for
themselves,
the
description
i
think
is
apt.
there
is
a
big
conflict
in
what
you
see
and
what
they
say
you
see.
they
would
bring
in
expert
witness.
i
think
remark
was
made
here
today
that
it
does
not
clearly
depict
certain
acts,
that
you'd
have
to
use
your
imagination
and
some
of
these
experts
testify
that
way.
but
in
the
new
orleans
bookmark
case,
i
think
it
was
judge
brown
who
observed
this
in
his
opinion,
thus
one
defense
witness
testified
that
a
particular
photograph
did
not
depict
cunnilingus,
but
only
suggested
it.
this
is
a
photograph
of
a
nude
female
with
photographic
focus
on
the
genital
area,
showing
a
male
head
face
a
few
inches
away,
mouth
open
and
tongue
out
and
the
witness
said,
“that
just
suggests
something,
it
does
not
show
anything.”
we
get
down
to
the
next
issue,
they
make
a
professional
witness
or
expert
witnesses
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
an
unusual
area
because
the
so
called
expert
witnesses
fall
in
two
categories.
one,
nothing
is
obscene
and
two,
everything
is
obscene,
which
leaves
the
jurors
sitting
neutral
again.
so,
as
in
this
case,
any
witness
who
is
a
personable
fellow.
they
brought
in
a
hired
gun
and
that’s
what
he
is,
he
is
a
hired
gun.
he
comes
there
for
purpose.
he
could
give
no
concern
about
what
happened
and
his
hired
gun
is
usually
a
non
resident,
he
just
comes
riding
in
and
he
services
a
contract
before,
before
he
views
the
material,
which
is
true
in
this
case.
this
man
got
on
the
airplane,
flew
to
atlanta,
had
an
agreement,
how
much
he’s
going
to
be
paid,
he’s
going
to
testify,
he
didn't
see
anything
he
will
testify
about.
as
the
matter
of
fact
he
has
seen
both
of
these
films
entirely,
but
we
let
that.
this
testimony
is
all
prepared.
he
arrives
at
trial
prepared
to
go
on
the
stand
and
his
testimony
won’t
vary
between
a
dozen
cases.
in
this
case,
dr.
darryl
didn’t
see
the
film
until
the
trial
was
in
progress
and
he
only
saw
a
part
of
magic
mirror,
but
this
didn’t
deter
his
testimony
one
iota
and
he
went
(inaudible).
then
he
testified
and
he
collects
his
bounty,
and
rides
off
in
the
setting
sun,
to
prepare
his
testimony
to
any
who
wants
to
buy
it.
and
he
candidly
compares,
he
says
no
sexually
oriented
material
is
obscene.
he
is
for
sale,
he
is
for
hire
and
that’s
all.
in
united
states
versus
brown,
the
court
made
a
reference
to
one
of
these
hired
guns.
and
they
said,
“referring
to
the
photographs
and
the
two
books
dr.
hammond
stated
they
would
appeal
to
some
homosexuals,
but
not
necessarily
anymore
than
sears
&
roebuck
catalog.
likewise,
dr.
hammond
indicated
that
these
books
were
no
more
revolting
than
a
television
commercial
showing
a
man
brushing
his
teeth.
the
realm
of
psychiatry
is
indeed
highly
technical
and
beyond
the
understanding
of
layman,
but
these
conclusions
seem
absurd.
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
difference
between
a
sears
&
roebuck
catalog
or
a
toothpaste
advertisement
and
these
two
books
is
almost
imaginable.
in
buckley
the
court
said
that
it
might
noted
in
passing
that
the
defendant’s
“expert
witnesses”
were
for
most
part
un-persuasive.
for
example,
a
defense
psychologist
testified
that
42nd
street
movies
depicting
sexual
intercourse
did
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex,
but
that
lingerie
ads
in
the
new
york
times
did.
so,
following
the
reasoning
and
going
to
the
graphically
obscene
material,
i
think
the
court
said
which
then
could
not
differ
in
their
opinion.
as
are
involved
here,
i
don’t
think
that
in
this
case
expert
opinion
was
necessary.
i
don’t
know
how
in
the
world
one
man
is
going
to
sit
before
a
judge
or
a
jury,
or
a
combination
of
the
two
and
tell
them
that
they
didn’t
see
on
the
screen
what
they
just
got
to
see
and
that’s
exactly
what
he
has
to
do.
i
have
tried
one
case
that
comes
to
mind
where
you
cross
examine
these
“expert
witnesses”
and
the
witness
actually
took
to
stand
involving
16
magazines
and
never
hesitated
in
his
testimony
for
one
moment
while
he
was
flipping
through.
so
he
could
testify
that
they
were
not
obscene.
this
is
incredible,
but
this
he
said.
so
we
say
that
the
procedural
proposition
is
correct.
the
fourth
question
is
the
question
the
court
asked
us
to
brief
and
to
argue,
whether
a
display
of
any
sexually
oriented
films
in
the
commercial
theatre,
when
surrounded
by
a
notice
to
the
public
of
that
nature
and
by
reasonable
protection
against
exposure
of
the
films
to
juveniles
is
constitutionally
protected.
i
set
out
in
my
brief
and
i
picked
up
here
the
commission
report,
the
commission
report
don't
like
to
use
the
word
obscene
and
they
had
hogged
the
word
pornographic,
and
they
were
the
ones
who
first
created
in
a
trial
court
picked
up,
the
use
of
the
phrases
explicit
sexual
material
or
sexually
oriented
materials,
erotica,
but
they
report
in
this
preface
on
page
three
cautions
that
the
word
materials
in
this
context,
is
meant
to
refer
to
the
entire
range
of
depictions
or
descriptions
in
both
textural
and
pictorial
form,
primarily
books,
magazines,
photographs,
films,
sound
recording,
statutory
and
sex
devices.
therefore,
when
faced
with
this
question
which
relates
to
any
sexual
oriented
materials,
we
must
consider
it
to
embrace
all
terms
from
cunnilingus
with
a
female
and
a
pig
which
is
on
the
market
to
the
redrup
inaculous
materials,
he
expands
the
spectrum.
i
would
caution
the
court
on
not
caution
it’s
not
the
proper
word,
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
distinction
being
made
between
the
written
work
and
a
motion
picture
film,
the
commission
makes
such
a
distinction
and
advices
against
the
legislation
which
would
prohibit
or
permit
children
to
view
pictorial
scenes
which
says
they
should
not
be
deprived
in
light
of
reading.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
it
was
silent
in
that
regard.
there
was
no
evidence
of
either
pandering
or
exposure
to
juveniles.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
because
i
don’t
think
that
it
was
raised
on
either
side.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
it
was
silent,
there
were
photographs
at
the
outside
of
the
theatre,
which
they
said
was
modest
warning
of
what
is
going
on
inside,
but
we
did
not
consider
that
to
be
as
such
to
be
pandering
the
streets.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
i
think
it
said
“be
21
or
be
gone”
or
something
like
that
i
presume
it
referred
to
the
age.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
that’s
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
that’s
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
lost
his
pictures
and
we
put
ours
in
filling.
they
were
very
gracious
people
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
he
said
that
they
were
frolicking
in
the
nude.
if
you
could
call
frolicking
in
a
nude
obscene,
well
maybe
this
is
true.
i
did
not
see
see
nor
did
the
supreme
court
see
where
the
word
frolic
came
from.
after
viewing
the
film,
they
held
it
to
be
hardcore
pornography,
i
don’t
think
it’s
in
the
question
about
it,
and
we
ask
this
court
to
go
along.
we're
in
the
fourth
question,
mr.
justice
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
a
very
serious
thing.
it
was
suggested
for
example
in
mr.
fliesman's
argument,
that
the
right
to
sell
a
book
is
based
upon
the
right
of
a
person
to
read
that
book.
now,
stanley
limited
itself
and
stated
very
clearly
that
nothing
--
roth
is
not
impaired
by
what
we
hold
here
today,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
it
emphasizes
that
roth
was
not
impaired
a
second
time
and
said
it
was
not
reversed
and
so
did
reidel.
but
a
number
of
the
lower
trial
courts
said,
“that’s
what
the
supreme
court
said,
but
that
is
not
what
they
meant.”
and
they
extended
stanley
to
the
right
to
possess,
to
the
right
to
receive.
any
statute
standing
between
that
highway,
was
struck
down.
the
right
to
receive
was
a
right
to
transport.
so
that
statute
went
aside
and
to
import,
and
that
strike
--
statute
went
aside
in
37
books
in
the
trial
court.
and
mind
you
again,
the
book
is
words
created
in
the
mind
of
an
author
and
nothing
more.
perhaps
they
are
more
erotic,
morphine,
i
don’t
know,
but
that
is
important
because
motion
picture
films
are
live
people
and
live
animals.
then
take
this
extension
if
it
can
be
so,
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
show
sexually
oriented
films
on
an
adult
under
controlled
circumstances
and
hold
that
this
is
constitutionally
protected,
then
someone
has
a
right
to
sell
these
films
to
the
distributor,
which
envisions
the
right
to
transport
these
films.
which
envisions
the
right
to
manufacture
the
film,
and
when
the
court
holds
that
a
person
has
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
extending
from
a
person
who
wants
to
view
a
film
to
manufacture
films
in
the
united
states
consisting
of
human
being
and
animal,
human
beings
and
human
beings,
man
and
man,
man
and
woman
or
combination
of
the
two,
then
we’ve
got
a
strange
first
amendment,
a
very
strange
first
amendment.
so
you
can't
start
extending
unless
you
go
all
the
way
and
this
is
a
step
in
this
court
to
be
taking
and
they
don’t
miss
anything.
now
this
question
was
decided
i
thought,
frankly
i
thought
that
reidel
was
a
slight
at
the
end
of
the
suit.
but
roth
first
held
that
is
obscenity
and
this
distribution
was
outside
the
reach
of
the
first
amendment.
in
reidel,
on
page
357,
this
court
observed
that
it
is
urged
that
there
is
a
development
sentiment
that
adult
should
have
complete
freedom
to
produce,
to
deal
in,
possess,
and
consume
whatever
commutative
materials
may
appeal
to
them
and
that
the
law's
involvement
with
obscenity
should
be
limited
to
those
situations
where
children
are
involved
or
where
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
imposition
on
unwilling
recipients
of
whatever
age.
the
concepts
involved
are
said
to
be
so
illusive
that
the
laws
so
inherently
unenforceable
without
extravagant
expenditures
of
time
and
effort
by
enforcement
officers,
and
that
the
courts,
the
basement
reassessment
is
not
only
wise,
but
essential
and
this
is
what
this
court
said.
this
may
prove
to
be
the
desirable
and
eventual
legislative
course,
but
if
it
is,
the
task
of
restructuring
the
obscenity
laws
lies
with
those
who
pass,
repeal,
and
amend
statutes
and
ordinances.
roth
and
like
cases
pose
no
obstacle
to
such
development,
and
this
is
where
this
question
should
lie,
for
it’s
then
in
someway,
some
control
could
have
to
stop
this
line
of
communication
along
the
line.
it
is
easy
to
look
at
one
part
of
the
question
and
say,
“we
can
do
this,
and
this
is
fine.”
but
you
must
look
to
the
overall
picture
as
to
how
it's
going
to
affect
everything.
and
by
proclaiming
a
constitutional
privilege
on
one
hand,
may
grant
a
constitutional
license
on
another
in
a
field
that
we
did
not
even
consider.
so
we're
getting
now
to
as
was
urged
in
this
reidel
to
produce,
to
manufacture,
to
create
and
this
would
be
indeed
a
tragic
thing.
the
same
holding
was
held
in
mugler
versus
cane
just
back
in
1887
and
it’s
been
that
way
ever
since.
now,
they
say
but
most
of
the
people
want
to
see
this
stuff,
it's
a
multi-million
dollar
industry.
gambling
is
a
multi
million
dollar
industry,
prostitution
is
a
multi
million
dollar
industry,
narcotics
is
a
multi
million
dollar
industry,
and
other
heinous
crimes.
so
the
money
value
we're
not
concerned
there.
the
fact
that
they
are
concerned
about
this
lonely
police
officer,
and
poor
district
attorney
who
has
to
prosecute
these
cases,
doesn't
appeal
to
me
very
favoredly,
there
is
no
valid
reason
for
doing
that.
but
they
say
that
the
congressional
commission,
the
presidential
commission
of
obscenity,
conclusively
shows
that
people
want
to
see
all
of
this
stuff.
this
commission
report
was
immediately
rejected
by
the
senate.
it
has
no
foundation
in
fact
or
in
science.
it
was
referred
in
the
congress
as
a
magna
carta
for
pornographers,
ludicrous,
and
a
fraud
among
the
american
people
and
it
was
solemnly
rejected.
now
of
all
of
the
hired
guns
that
they
come
down,
that
it
first
relied
upon
the
commission
report
and
now
they
have
some
other
formula
about
telling
you
what
the
community
standards
are
in
texas
when
they’ve
never
been
south
of
new
york.
there
is
one
survey
upon
which
this
commission
primarily
bases
it’s
report,
that
they
don’t
like
to
talk
about.
and
even
the
most
(inaudible),
and
most
saddled
soul,
hired
gun,
admits
that
the
question
is
absolutely
a
fraud
and
unscientific.
this
was,
the
abelson
report
and
its
contained
in
the
court
there
and
the
book
says
in
the
public
opinion
about
sexually
oriented
materials,
in
1970,
a
survey
involving
face
to
face
interviews
with
a
random
sample
of
2,486
adults
and
769
young
persons
aged
15
to
20
was
conducted
at
the
commission’s
request
abelson
et
al.
(1970).
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
survey
was
to
determine
whether
americans
regard
and
to
find
the
area
of
erotic
materials
as
a
significant
or
important
social
problem.
adults
respondents
were
asked
in
the
survey
were
asked
this
question
and
this
is
the
deal.
would
you
please
tell
me
what
you
think
are
the
two
most
serious
problems
facing
the
country
today?
and
they
set
out
what
answers
they
gave,
but
only
2%
mentioned
erotic
material.
therefore,
98%
could
not
be
concerned
with
it,
but
none
of
them
mentioned
cancer,
tuberculosis,
i
guess
nobody
was
concerned
with
that.
this
negative
report
yet
on
the
same
page
where
this
is
contained,
a
report
did
candidly
say
this,
“opinion
survey
sometimes
appear
to
report
contradictory
findings
and
the
findings
of
the
commission
study
abelson
(1970),
may
appear
to
be
inconsistent
with
reports
that
85%
of
the
american
adults
favor
stricter
laws
on
pornography,
that's
the
gallup
opinion,
and
that
76%
want
pornographic
literature
outlawed
and
72%
believe
smut
is
taking
beauty
out
of
sex”
and
how
you
can
join
those
two
or
reconcile
those
two
i
will
never
know.
the
opinion
though
and
this
is
my
idea
or
understanding
of
this
entire
case
is
an
effort
to
have
this
court
make
the
judgment
of
this
commission
of
obscenity
and
pornography.
the
judgment
of
this
court
which
would
in
effect
repeal
every
law
in
obscenity
in
united
states.
we
say
that
this
can
be
shown
in
commercial
theatre,
any
material
under
controlled
circumstances
and
every
law
relating
to
pornography
throughout
the
state
will
be
abolished
except
it
applies
to
children.
perhaps,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
we’ve
dealt
too
long
in
trying
to
define
the
word
obscene
or
pornography
and
it's
time
we
begin
to
describe
the
act
rather
than
to
define
the
word,
while
it
described
it
and
said,
“certain
things
were
hard
core
pornography.”
evanovich
(ph)
describe
it
and
said,
“this
is
hard
core
pornography,”
but
the
judge
also
in
there
said,
“emphasized
in
such
a
way
as
to
totally
depersonalize
the
human
model
into
an
object
or
thing
plainly
design
to
make
possible
and
this
non
cumulative
kind
of
ultimately
effect
to
these
material.
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
filed
this
suit
and
have
been
involved
with
it
since
very
inception.
there
existed
at
that
time
in
georgia
three
basic
types
of
procedure,
one
was
strictly
civil,
one
was
strictly
criminal,
and
one
was
civil
leading
toward
the
criminal
process.
now,
before
i
was
in
office
in
this
particular
case,
the
solicitor
traveled
the
criminal
route.
he
was
stopped
in
gable
versus
jenkins
and
the
federal
district
court
says
“no,
you
must
first
have
a
prior
adversary
hearing
before
seizing
the
material.”
and
therefore,
we
started
the
civil
proceedings
as
a
prior
adversary
proceeding
leading
to
the
seizure
of
the
film
for
criminal
prosecution
purposes.
i
might
add
at
this
juncture,
that
this
is
not
anyhow
imposed
upon
us.
the
federal
court
says
there
they
were
mixing
the
apples
and
oranges,
civil
and
criminal
procedure.
and
it
complicated
matters
and
as
long
as
the
court
would
stick
with
the
civil
process
on
the
one
hand
and
the
absolute
criminal
process
on
the
other,
we
had
a
clear
and
defined
area,
that
the
criminal
process
would
inherit
it,
grant
to
the
person
a
far
greater
protection
than
any
civil
injunction
could
grant.
nevertheless,
the
outline
or
the
method
of
using
an
injunction
was
suggested
indeed.
then
we
started
that
process,
and
a
petition
was
filed
alleging
that
the
film
in
this
case
was
obscene,
setting
out
a
factual
description
of
the
film.
we
showed
it
was
being
exhibited
to
the
general
public
on
a
fee
basis.
we
asked
the
court
to
restrain
and
enjoin
them
from
further
showing
the
film.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
i
believe
at
the
recess
we
were
at
the
point
concerning
the
procedure
employed
in
this
particular
case
in
the
state
of
georgia.
the
petition
as
it
was
served
upon
the
defendants
at
that
time,
did
not
restrain
the
showing
of
the
film,
did
not
in
anyway
interfere
with
the
showing
of
the
film.
it
simply
restrained
and
enjoined
them
temporarily
from
removing
the
film
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
a
hearing
was
then
set
immediately
thereafter.
from
that
juncture
it
is
entirely
up
to
the
exhibitor
whether
he
wants
a
hearing
or
whether
the
state
will
press
forward
at
that
time,
which
we
generally
do.
any
continuance
is
on
the
behalf
of
the
exhibitor.
in
the
meantime,
he
can
continue
to
show
the
file.
then
after
an
adversary
hearing
and
i
might
add
to
our
opposing
counsel
i
would
mention
this
to
the
court
that
the
film
was
produced
by
counsel
wrapped
in
a
christmas
package
and
which
the
court
graciously
accepted
it
in
a
manner
it
was
tended.
the
film
was
shown
and
the
court
in
this
case
did
not
render
decision
for
quite
sometime.
there
was
still
no
injunction
whatsoever
about
showing
of
the
film.
unlike
most
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
no
sir,
it
was
kept
as
evidence
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
they
could
do
so.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
i
do
not
know
sir.
but
that
was
a
procedure
imposed
on
us
by
the
federal
judiciary
in
georgia.
i
might
point
this
out
at
this
juncture
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir,
after
a
hearing.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
there
was
no
prohibition
about
exhibiting
the
film.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
no
sir.
we
do
not
use
this
procedure
anymore
and
we
only
used
it
then
because
it
was
imposed
upon
us.
we
resisted
it
then
and
we
resist
it
now.
for
you
see,
unlike
most
states
since
1877,
georgia
enacted
a
constitutional
provision
which
reads
“liberty
of
speech
or
of
the
press
guarantee,
no
law
shall
ever
be
passed
to
curtail
or
restrain
the
liberty
of
speech
or
of
the
press.
any
person
may
speak
right
and
publish
his
sentiments
on
all
subjects
being
responsible
for
the
abuse
of
that
liberty.”
now
on
that
statute
or
because
of
that
statute,
i
personally
filed
suit
in
k.
gordon
murray
productions
versus
floyd
and
challenged
the
censorship
ordinances
in
the
city
of
atlanta,
georgia
in
1962.
the
ordinances
i
contended
then
were
infected
with
the
vice
in
teitel
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
declared
it
unconstitutional,
as
abridging
this
particular
provision.
and
said
that
they
could
show
what
they
please
but
they
are
going
to
be
responsible
for
that
to
show
and
if
it
amounts
to
criminal
acts
in
nature
they
can
be
punished
for
the
criminal
acts
in
nature,
just
as
you
can
have
a
gun
legitimately
on
person
and
that’s
all
right
or
in
your
home,
but
if
you
use
that
gun
for
an
illegal
purpose
that
is
something
else
again
and
that
is
a
procedure
that
we
adopted
in
the
state
of
georgia.
i
might
add
that
in
just
passing
that
references
made
to
oregon,
now
why
i
believe
reducing
the
standards
of
obscenity
or
abolishing
it
all
together.
that
i
say
is
well
and
good,
if
that’s
what
the
state
there
wants.
this
is
a
legislative
problem
we
are
coping
with
and
not
as
we
contend
a
judicial
problem.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
in
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
we
would
proceed
under
search
warrant,
and
proceed
criminally,
and
make
the
arrest,
have
the
commitment
hearing
which
we
are
required
to
do
in
the
matter
of
24
to
48
hours
and
have
every
criminal
--
a
protection
of
any
person
accused
of
crime,
there
could
be
no
destruction.
the
only
difference
in
civil
process
strictly
civil
and
strictly
criminal
where
that
be
body
of
intertwine
is
that
in
the
civil
process
is
for
the
purpose
of
seizure
and
destruction.
in
a
criminal
process,
its
seizure
for
the
purpose
of
evidence.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes,
a
factual
affidavit
now.
not
one
just
to
say
that
i
saw
a
film
but
it’s
obscene.
it
has
to
start
off
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
--
exactly
as
the
film
is
described
in
this
brief
and
that’s
the
factual
basis
upon
which
they
are
now
issued,
and
let
the
magistrate
himself
determine
it.
and
that
is
why
we
have
made
no
effort
to
school
the
police
officer
in
the
field
of
pornography
and
we
don’t
want
his
extra
judicial
opinion.
what
we
want
to
know
is
an
affidavit
of
what
you
saw
and
where
you
saw
and
when
you
saw
and
let
the
justice
take
it
from
there.
the
motion
picture
films
here
i
think
speak
for
themselves,
the
description
i
think
is
apt.
there
is
a
big
conflict
in
what
you
see
and
what
they
say
you
see.
they
would
bring
in
expert
witness.
i
think
remark
was
made
here
today
that
it
does
not
clearly
depict
certain
acts,
that
you'd
have
to
use
your
imagination
and
some
of
these
experts
testify
that
way.
but
in
the
new
orleans
bookmark
case,
i
think
it
was
judge
brown
who
observed
this
in
his
opinion,
thus
one
defense
witness
testified
that
a
particular
photograph
did
not
depict
cunnilingus,
but
only
suggested
it.
this
is
a
photograph
of
a
nude
female
with
photographic
focus
on
the
genital
area,
showing
a
male
head
face
a
few
inches
away,
mouth
open
and
tongue
out
and
the
witness
said,
“that
just
suggests
something,
it
does
not
show
anything.”
we
get
down
to
the
next
issue,
they
make
a
professional
witness
or
expert
witnesses
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
an
unusual
area
because
the
so
called
expert
witnesses
fall
in
two
categories.
one,
nothing
is
obscene
and
two,
everything
is
obscene,
which
leaves
the
jurors
sitting
neutral
again.
so,
as
in
this
case,
any
witness
who
is
a
personable
fellow.
they
brought
in
a
hired
gun
and
that’s
what
he
is,
he
is
a
hired
gun.
he
comes
there
for
purpose.
he
could
give
no
concern
about
what
happened
and
his
hired
gun
is
usually
a
non
resident,
he
just
comes
riding
in
and
he
services
a
contract
before,
before
he
views
the
material,
which
is
true
in
this
case.
this
man
got
on
the
airplane,
flew
to
atlanta,
had
an
agreement,
how
much
he’s
going
to
be
paid,
he’s
going
to
testify,
he
didn't
see
anything
he
will
testify
about.
as
the
matter
of
fact
he
has
seen
both
of
these
films
entirely,
but
we
let
that.
this
testimony
is
all
prepared.
he
arrives
at
trial
prepared
to
go
on
the
stand
and
his
testimony
won’t
vary
between
a
dozen
cases.
in
this
case,
dr.
darryl
didn’t
see
the
film
until
the
trial
was
in
progress
and
he
only
saw
a
part
of
magic
mirror,
but
this
didn’t
deter
his
testimony
one
iota
and
he
went
(inaudible).
then
he
testified
and
he
collects
his
bounty,
and
rides
off
in
the
setting
sun,
to
prepare
his
testimony
to
any
who
wants
to
buy
it.
and
he
candidly
compares,
he
says
no
sexually
oriented
material
is
obscene.
he
is
for
sale,
he
is
for
hire
and
that’s
all.
in
united
states
versus
brown,
the
court
made
a
reference
to
one
of
these
hired
guns.
and
they
said,
“referring
to
the
photographs
and
the
two
books
dr.
hammond
stated
they
would
appeal
to
some
homosexuals,
but
not
necessarily
anymore
than
sears
&
roebuck
catalog.
likewise,
dr.
hammond
indicated
that
these
books
were
no
more
revolting
than
a
television
commercial
showing
a
man
brushing
his
teeth.
the
realm
of
psychiatry
is
indeed
highly
technical
and
beyond
the
understanding
of
layman,
but
these
conclusions
seem
absurd.
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
difference
between
a
sears
&
roebuck
catalog
or
a
toothpaste
advertisement
and
these
two
books
is
almost
imaginable.
in
buckley
the
court
said
that
it
might
noted
in
passing
that
the
defendant’s
“expert
witnesses”
were
for
most
part
un-persuasive.
for
example,
a
defense
psychologist
testified
that
42nd
street
movies
depicting
sexual
intercourse
did
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex,
but
that
lingerie
ads
in
the
new
york
times
did.
so,
following
the
reasoning
and
going
to
the
graphically
obscene
material,
i
think
the
court
said
which
then
could
not
differ
in
their
opinion.
as
are
involved
here,
i
don’t
think
that
in
this
case
expert
opinion
was
necessary.
i
don’t
know
how
in
the
world
one
man
is
going
to
sit
before
a
judge
or
a
jury,
or
a
combination
of
the
two
and
tell
them
that
they
didn’t
see
on
the
screen
what
they
just
got
to
see
and
that’s
exactly
what
he
has
to
do.
i
have
tried
one
case
that
comes
to
mind
where
you
cross
examine
these
“expert
witnesses”
and
the
witness
actually
took
to
stand
involving
16
magazines
and
never
hesitated
in
his
testimony
for
one
moment
while
he
was
flipping
through.
so
he
could
testify
that
they
were
not
obscene.
this
is
incredible,
but
this
he
said.
so
we
say
that
the
procedural
proposition
is
correct.
the
fourth
question
is
the
question
the
court
asked
us
to
brief
and
to
argue,
whether
a
display
of
any
sexually
oriented
films
in
the
commercial
theatre,
when
surrounded
by
a
notice
to
the
public
of
that
nature
and
by
reasonable
protection
against
exposure
of
the
films
to
juveniles
is
constitutionally
protected.
i
set
out
in
my
brief
and
i
picked
up
here
the
commission
report,
the
commission
report
don't
like
to
use
the
word
obscene
and
they
had
hogged
the
word
pornographic,
and
they
were
the
ones
who
first
created
in
a
trial
court
picked
up,
the
use
of
the
phrases
explicit
sexual
material
or
sexually
oriented
materials,
erotica,
but
they
report
in
this
preface
on
page
three
cautions
that
the
word
materials
in
this
context,
is
meant
to
refer
to
the
entire
range
of
depictions
or
descriptions
in
both
textural
and
pictorial
form,
primarily
books,
magazines,
photographs,
films,
sound
recording,
statutory
and
sex
devices.
therefore,
when
faced
with
this
question
which
relates
to
any
sexual
oriented
materials,
we
must
consider
it
to
embrace
all
terms
from
cunnilingus
with
a
female
and
a
pig
which
is
on
the
market
to
the
redrup
inaculous
materials,
he
expands
the
spectrum.
i
would
caution
the
court
on
not
caution
it’s
not
the
proper
word,
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
distinction
being
made
between
the
written
work
and
a
motion
picture
film,
the
commission
makes
such
a
distinction
and
advices
against
the
legislation
which
would
prohibit
or
permit
children
to
view
pictorial
scenes
which
says
they
should
not
be
deprived
in
light
of
reading.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
it
was
silent
in
that
regard.
there
was
no
evidence
of
either
pandering
or
exposure
to
juveniles.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
because
i
don’t
think
that
it
was
raised
on
either
side.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
it
was
silent,
there
were
photographs
at
the
outside
of
the
theatre,
which
they
said
was
modest
warning
of
what
is
going
on
inside,
but
we
did
not
consider
that
to
be
as
such
to
be
pandering
the
streets.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
i
think
it
said
“be
21
or
be
gone”
or
something
like
that
i
presume
it
referred
to
the
age.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
that’s
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
that’s
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
lost
his
pictures
and
we
put
ours
in
filling.
they
were
very
gracious
people
--
mr.
thomas
e.
moran
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
he
said
that
they
were
frolicking
in
the
nude.
if
you
could
call
frolicking
in
a
nude
obscene,
well
maybe
this
is
true.
i
did
not
see
see
nor
did
the
supreme
court
see
where
the
word
frolic
came
from.
after
viewing
the
film,
they
held
it
to
be
hardcore
pornography,
i
don’t
think
it’s
in
the
question
about
it,
and
we
ask
this
court
to
go
along.
we're
in
the
fourth
question,
mr.
justice
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
a
very
serious
thing.
it
was
suggested
for
example
in
mr.
fliesman's
argument,
that
the
right
to
sell
a
book
is
based
upon
the
right
of
a
person
to
read
that
book.
now,
stanley
limited
itself
and
stated
very
clearly
that
nothing
--
roth
is
not
impaired
by
what
we
hold
here
today,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
it
emphasizes
that
roth
was
not
impaired
a
second
time
and
said
it
was
not
reversed
and
so
did
reidel.
but
a
number
of
the
lower
trial
courts
said,
“that’s
what
the
supreme
court
said,
but
that
is
not
what
they
meant.”
and
they
extended
stanley
to
the
right
to
possess,
to
the
right
to
receive.
any
statute
standing
between
that
highway,
was
struck
down.
the
right
to
receive
was
a
right
to
transport.
so
that
statute
went
aside
and
to
import,
and
that
strike
--
statute
went
aside
in
37
books
in
the
trial
court.
and
mind
you
again,
the
book
is
words
created
in
the
mind
of
an
author
and
nothing
more.
perhaps
they
are
more
erotic,
morphine,
i
don’t
know,
but
that
is
important
because
motion
picture
films
are
live
people
and
live
animals.
then
take
this
extension
if
it
can
be
so,
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
show
sexually
oriented
films
on
an
adult
under
controlled
circumstances
and
hold
that
this
is
constitutionally
protected,
then
someone
has
a
right
to
sell
these
films
to
the
distributor,
which
envisions
the
right
to
transport
these
films.
which
envisions
the
right
to
manufacture
the
film,
and
when
the
court
holds
that
a
person
has
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
extending
from
a
person
who
wants
to
view
a
film
to
manufacture
films
in
the
united
states
consisting
of
human
being
and
animal,
human
beings
and
human
beings,
man
and
man,
man
and
woman
or
combination
of
the
two,
then
we’ve
got
a
strange
first
amendment,
a
very
strange
first
amendment.
so
you
can't
start
extending
unless
you
go
all
the
way
and
this
is
a
step
in
this
court
to
be
taking
and
they
don’t
miss
anything.
now
this
question
was
decided
i
thought,
frankly
i
thought
that
reidel
was
a
slight
at
the
end
of
the
suit.
but
roth
first
held
that
is
obscenity
and
this
distribution
was
outside
the
reach
of
the
first
amendment.
in
reidel,
on
page
357,
this
court
observed
that
it
is
urged
that
there
is
a
development
sentiment
that
adult
should
have
complete
freedom
to
produce,
to
deal
in,
possess,
and
consume
whatever
commutative
materials
may
appeal
to
them
and
that
the
law's
involvement
with
obscenity
should
be
limited
to
those
situations
where
children
are
involved
or
where
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
imposition
on
unwilling
recipients
of
whatever
age.
the
concepts
involved
are
said
to
be
so
illusive
that
the
laws
so
inherently
unenforceable
without
extravagant
expenditures
of
time
and
effort
by
enforcement
officers,
and
that
the
courts,
the
basement
reassessment
is
not
only
wise,
but
essential
and
this
is
what
this
court
said.
this
may
prove
to
be
the
desirable
and
eventual
legislative
course,
but
if
it
is,
the
task
of
restructuring
the
obscenity
laws
lies
with
those
who
pass,
repeal,
and
amend
statutes
and
ordinances.
roth
and
like
cases
pose
no
obstacle
to
such
development,
and
this
is
where
this
question
should
lie,
for
it’s
then
in
someway,
some
control
could
have
to
stop
this
line
of
communication
along
the
line.
it
is
easy
to
look
at
one
part
of
the
question
and
say,
“we
can
do
this,
and
this
is
fine.”
but
you
must
look
to
the
overall
picture
as
to
how
it's
going
to
affect
everything.
and
by
proclaiming
a
constitutional
privilege
on
one
hand,
may
grant
a
constitutional
license
on
another
in
a
field
that
we
did
not
even
consider.
so
we're
getting
now
to
as
was
urged
in
this
reidel
to
produce,
to
manufacture,
to
create
and
this
would
be
indeed
a
tragic
thing.
the
same
holding
was
held
in
mugler
versus
cane
just
back
in
1887
and
it’s
been
that
way
ever
since.
now,
they
say
but
most
of
the
people
want
to
see
this
stuff,
it's
a
multi-million
dollar
industry.
gambling
is
a
multi
million
dollar
industry,
prostitution
is
a
multi
million
dollar
industry,
narcotics
is
a
multi
million
dollar
industry,
and
other
heinous
crimes.
so
the
money
value
we're
not
concerned
there.
the
fact
that
they
are
concerned
about
this
lonely
police
officer,
and
poor
district
attorney
who
has
to
prosecute
these
cases,
doesn't
appeal
to
me
very
favoredly,
there
is
no
valid
reason
for
doing
that.
but
they
say
that
the
congressional
commission,
the
presidential
commission
of
obscenity,
conclusively
shows
that
people
want
to
see
all
of
this
stuff.
this
commission
report
was
immediately
rejected
by
the
senate.
it
has
no
foundation
in
fact
or
in
science.
it
was
referred
in
the
congress
as
a
magna
carta
for
pornographers,
ludicrous,
and
a
fraud
among
the
american
people
and
it
was
solemnly
rejected.
now
of
all
of
the
hired
guns
that
they
come
down,
that
it
first
relied
upon
the
commission
report
and
now
they
have
some
other
formula
about
telling
you
what
the
community
standards
are
in
texas
when
they’ve
never
been
south
of
new
york.
there
is
one
survey
upon
which
this
commission
primarily
bases
it’s
report,
that
they
don’t
like
to
talk
about.
and
even
the
most
(inaudible),
and
most
saddled
soul,
hired
gun,
admits
that
the
question
is
absolutely
a
fraud
and
unscientific.
this
was,
the
abelson
report
and
its
contained
in
the
court
there
and
the
book
says
in
the
public
opinion
about
sexually
oriented
materials,
in
1970,
a
survey
involving
face
to
face
interviews
with
a
random
sample
of
2,486
adults
and
769
young
persons
aged
15
to
20
was
conducted
at
the
commission’s
request
abelson
et
al.
(1970).
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
survey
was
to
determine
whether
americans
regard
and
to
find
the
area
of
erotic
materials
as
a
significant
or
important
social
problem.
adults
respondents
were
asked
in
the
survey
were
asked
this
question
and
this
is
the
deal.
would
you
please
tell
me
what
you
think
are
the
two
most
serious
problems
facing
the
country
today?
and
they
set
out
what
answers
they
gave,
but
only
2%
mentioned
erotic
material.
therefore,
98%
could
not
be
concerned
with
it,
but
none
of
them
mentioned
cancer,
tuberculosis,
i
guess
nobody
was
concerned
with
that.
this
negative
report
yet
on
the
same
page
where
this
is
contained,
a
report
did
candidly
say
this,
“opinion
survey
sometimes
appear
to
report
contradictory
findings
and
the
findings
of
the
commission
study
abelson
(1970),
may
appear
to
be
inconsistent
with
reports
that
85%
of
the
american
adults
favor
stricter
laws
on
pornography,
that's
the
gallup
opinion,
and
that
76%
want
pornographic
literature
outlawed
and
72%
believe
smut
is
taking
beauty
out
of
sex”
and
how
you
can
join
those
two
or
reconcile
those
two
i
will
never
know.
the
opinion
though
and
this
is
my
idea
or
understanding
of
this
entire
case
is
an
effort
to
have
this
court
make
the
judgment
of
this
commission
of
obscenity
and
pornography.
the
judgment
of
this
court
which
would
in
effect
repeal
every
law
in
obscenity
in
united
states.
we
say
that
this
can
be
shown
in
commercial
theatre,
any
material
under
controlled
circumstances
and
every
law
relating
to
pornography
throughout
the
state
will
be
abolished
except
it
applies
to
children.
perhaps,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
we’ve
dealt
too
long
in
trying
to
define
the
word
obscene
or
pornography
and
it's
time
we
begin
to
describe
the
act
rather
than
to
define
the
word,
while
it
described
it
and
said,
“certain
things
were
hard
core
pornography.”
evanovich
(ph)
describe
it
and
said,
“this
is
hard
core
pornography,”
but
the
judge
also
in
there
said,
“emphasized
in
such
a
way
as
to
totally
depersonalize
the
human
model
into
an
object
or
thing
plainly
design
to
make
possible
and
this
non
cumulative
kind
of
ultimately
effect
to
these
material.
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm.
thank
you.
