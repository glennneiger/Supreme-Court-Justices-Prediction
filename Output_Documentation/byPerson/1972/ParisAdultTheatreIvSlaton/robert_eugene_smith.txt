mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
originated
in
the
city
of
atlanta
when
the
respondents
filed
a
complaint
seeking
in
essence
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
to
prohibit
of
the
showing
of
two
movies.
this
comes
about
because
the
theatre,
the
paris
adult
theatre,
had
two
separate
sections
to
it
where
separate
films
were
being
shown
and
one
would
walk
in
to
the
cashier
and
go
in
one
or
go
in
the
other.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
common
lobby,
yes
sir.
and
then
the
door
would
open
to
the
particular
film
they
wanted
to
go
see.
the
complaint
filed
by
the
prosecutor,
by
the
prosecution
or
the
respondents
in
this
case
sought
a
temporary
injunction
to
stop
the
showing
of
the
film
pending
the
hearing
on
the
permanent
injunction.
fortuitously,
the
judge
did
not
sign
that
broad
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
merely
to
sought
to
stop
the
petitioners
in
this
case
from
taking
the
films
out
of
the
jurisdiction
or
altering,
or
removing
them.
a
hearing
was
scheduled
in
january
and
ultimately
on
january
13th,
1971
the
films
were
produced.
their
evidence
produced
before
the
court
indicated
that
this
theatre
had
its
outside
was
painted
so
that
no
one
could
see
inside
and
there
were
several
legends
on
the
windows,
to
the
extent
for
adults
only,
you
must
be
21
and
be
able
to
prove
it.
if
viewing
the
nude
body
offends
you,
do
not
enter.
the
fore
warning
of
the
character
of
the
material
which
one
might
expect
to
find
therein
was
clearly
stated
on
the
outside.
the
prosecution
at
the
time
of
the
presentation
of
its
case,
brought
in
several
witnesses
who
had
viewed
the
movie.
these
were
investigators
in
the
office
of
the
solicitor,
and
they
indicated
that
these
films
showed
explicit
sexual
acts
of
cunnilingual,
fellatio,
and
intercourse.
the
trial
judge,
after
viewing
the
movies
found
they
did
not
show
these
explicit
acts.
they
were
simulated.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said,
“well,
it
doesn’t
leave
really
much
to
the
imagination
and
its
close
enough.
and
besides,
we
thought
the
acts
which
in
essence
were
simulated
in
i
am
curious
(yellow),
that
this
is
the
same
kind
of
thing,
we
thought
was
obscene
in
i
am
curious
(yellow),
and
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
has
not
reversed
in
that
case,
and
so
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
this
is
hardcore
pornography.”
that
was
just
the
title
they
threw
on
it.
even
though
there
were
no
explicit
sexual
acts
consummated
in
this
particular
film,
sort
of
in
a
sense
of
the
language
of
this
court
in
rabe
versus
washington,
when
it
was
talking
about
certain
types
of
films.
the
court
as
i
said
issued
its
order
and
held
these
were
not
hardcore
pornography,
that
there
were
no
minors
involved,
and
that
as
far
as
the
court
was
concerned,
they
were
tasteless,
vulgar,
childish,
unimaginative,
boring,
but
as
far
its
concern,
it
was
protected
by
the
constitution.
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
and
we
are
here
on
this
issue.
we
pointed
out
initially
in
our
brief
that
the
procedural
--
there
were
no
procedural
guidelines
for
this
taking
process
in
the
state.
there
is
no
statute
that
permits
this,
there
is
no
authority,
no
judicial
construction
that
will
say,
that
as
far
as
the
court
will
hear
it
on
a
certain
day,
the
court
will
decide
within
a
certain
number
of
days
as
to
its
decision
in
this
particular
matter.
we
say
the
procedural
safeguards
are
lacking.
they
are
not
there,
but
yet
the
state
has
or
been
allowed
to
do
it
in
this
manner.
but
more
importantly,
we’d
like
to
direct
their
argument
to
the
question
suggested
by
this
court
with
regard
to
the
display
of
sexually
oriented
films.
my
brother
in
his
brief
would
interpret
the
terminology,
any
sexually
oriented
films
as
meaning
obscene
films.
i
interpret
that
in
slightly
different
way.
we
view
this
as
being
whatever
the
definition,
whatever
definition
of
the
members
of
this
court,
whatever
definition
is
supplied
by
statute,
whether
it's
something
to
the
left
of
pinocchio
on
up
to
the
extremes
that
mr.
moran
has
cited
in
his
brief,
whatever
--
however
will
you
define,
whatever
denominator
you
use
to
define
and
aside
from
the
specific
definition,
is
there
a
constitutional
right
to
offer
this
for
dissemination
in
a
commercial
theatre
where
there
are
no
children
admitted
and
where
there
are
some
note
of
notice,
some
warning
on
the
outside
of
the
theatre
as
to
the
character
of
the
material
being
offered
there.
now
my
brother
would
say,
“yes,
but
there
was
no
sign
that
said
cunnilingual
activity
depicted,
no
sign
that
said
fellatio,
just
said
if
the
nude
body
offends
you,
please
don’t
enter.”
but
the
first
time
we
put
a
sign
out
that
said,
cunnilingual
activity
in,
fellatio
in,
they
maybe
hauling
us
in
and
charging
us
with
pandering,
which
in
essence
what
they
did
in
other
cases
in
that
jurisdiction
where
that
particular
matter
was
present
on
the
outside
of
the
theatre.
so
in
this
context,
this
is
what
we
have.
addressing
ourselves
to
the
greater
point,
we
don’t
think
that
roth
necessarily
is
inconsistent
with
the
argument
we’re
making
today.
this
court
in
essence
did
say
in
roth
that
“yes,
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.”
but
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
door
barring
federal
encroachment
into
this
area
must
be
kept
tightly
closed
to
prevent
encroachment
upon
more
important
interest.
we
suggest
that
the
redrup
cases
which
in
essence
started
a
trend
in
which
there
are
approximately
33
or
34
cases
reversed
per
curiam,
let
us
gently
from
a
point
of
focusing
on
the
expression,
to
focusing
on
conduct.
it
is
as
mr.
fliesman
pointed
out
with
regard
to
the
california
attorney
general
who
was
walking
down
the
street
last
night,
we
do
not
have
in
this
record
any
reference
to
anyone
standing
outside
of
the
theatre
and
hustling
them
in
as
you
might
find
at
a
night
club
or
something
like
that,
nothing
whatsoever.
there
is
absolutely
no
hustling
or
any
way
pandering,
however,
you
might
define
those
terms
involved
in
this
case.
we
suggest
that
the
right
of
the
disseminator
to
assert
his
position
although
he
is
not
necessarily
the
viewer,
is
clear
from
a
variety
of
cases
held
by
this
court.
one
of
the
key
points
that
the
court
has
made
with
regards
to
first
amendment,
is
that
if
they
are
not
the
procedural
safeguards,
we
are
going
to
have
an
inducement
of
self
censorship
and
when
one
induces
the
self
censorship,
then
in
essence
the
public
is
the
loser.
the
public
is
the
loser
and
in
prosecutions
undertaken
without
--
in
this
context,
sure
they
can
be
punished
if
there
is
going
to
be
an
intrusion,
but
we
do
not
have
it
in
this
case.
there
is
not
in
this
case
the
problem
that
might
be
presented
in
a
magazine
or
a
bookstore
where
the
book
is
taken
out
of
the
store
and
left
in
a
trashcan,
and
the
possibility
it
maybe
found
by
children.
we
have
a
film,
in
a
commercial
theatre
where
people
can
go
and
view
it.
in
carr
lexus
versus
burn
reversed
by
this
court
on
other
grounds,
the
lower
court
held
that
if
stanley
in
essence
can
watch
a
film
of
any
kind,
any
sexually
oriented
film,
sexually
explicit
film
in
the
privacy
of
his
home,
why
can’t
a
few
fellows
get
together
and
watch
it
in
a
commercial
setting
and
have
just
the
same
sense
of
privacy
and
the
same
sense
of
protection
and
we
suggest
that
makes
good
sense.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
approximately
600
millions
of
dollars
are
spent
in
a
year
on
the
sale
of
and
or
exhibition
of
sexually
explicit
material
and
that’s
an
awful
lot
of
public
support
for
an
interest
in
sexually
explicit
material.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
would
say
your
honor,
a
great
deal.
i’m
sure
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
i
think
mr.
clancy,
my
brother
who
has
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case
probably
would
feel
they
will
be
put
out
of
work,
but
in
this
context,
we
think
that
the
focus
on
action
on
the
conduct
of
the
disseminator
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
protection
of
the
right
of
the
public
under
the
first
amendment.
we
are
not
as
in
reidel
conceding
that
these
films
are
obscene.
in
reidel
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion
to
dismiss,
there
was
a
concession
that
for
that
matter
assume
the
films
are
obscene.
we’re
saying
something
different.
we’re
saying
that
the
definition
of
whether
the
films
are
obscene,
is
not
relevant
until
an
impermissible
intrusion
occurs
by
the
act
of
the
disseminator
in
thrusting
upon
someone
or
by
having
involved
with
minors
in
that
particular
case,
just
does
not
exist
here.
so
we
say
it
is
not
inconsistent
for
this
to
have
occurred.
we
also
have
argued
and
set
forth
that
the
film
itself,
regardless
of
the
argument
that
we
make
on
the
right
of
an
adult,
the
right
of
a
disseminator
to
show
films
in
a
adult
theatre,
that
these
films
are
not
obscene.
they
are
not
unlike
films
for
instance
involved
in
the
hartstein
case,
films
that
were
involved
in
a
wiener
case.
and
these
points
out
the
difficulty
we
suggest
why
this
court
shouldn’t
annunciate
broader
protection
and
a
positive
protection
to
eliminate
the
difficulty
inherent
in
trying
to
fit
a
definition
because
in
some
states,
prurient
interest
is
defined
as
shameful
and
morbid.
now
there
is
--
it
is
an
itching
sensation,
i
think
using
the
term
--
some
of
the
terminology
taken
from
a
marginal
note
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
roth
case
using
that
phraseology.
and
then
prurient
means
so
many
different
things
to
so
many
different
people
and
then
the
question
of
community
standards.
are
we
talking
about
some
standard
to
which
we
all
should
aspire?
getting
married
for
life
and
never
having
an
extra
marital
affair
and
never
getting
divorced.
but
is
that
what
the
community
really
does?
sure!
that
is
something.
that
is
the
ideal,
that’s
what
we
really
hope
aspire
to
but
then
in
this
context,
is
the
community
standard,
that
which
we
should
aspire
to,
or
is
it
that
which
we
find
ourselves
in
today
and
is
there
a
single
standard
in
our
community?
we
suggest
there
is
not.
there
are
many
--
there’s
a
standard
of
different
groups.
it's
clear
in
surveys
taken
whether
they
are
political
surveys,
whether
they’re
sex
research
surveys,
that
there
is
a
conservative
element
in
our
society,
there
is
a
liberal
element
in
our
society,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
just
don’t
care
one
way
or
the
other
or
at
least
don’t
show
a
great
deal
of
positive
interest
in
responding.
we’ve
indicated
that
there
were
community
attitude
surveys
by
the
presidential
commission
on
pornography
and
obscenity,
where
several
millions
of
dollars
were
spent,
taking
a
survey
on
a
demographic
basis
throughout
the
united
states.
and
one
of
the
conclusions
were
that
many
people
felt
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
reidel
that
there
is
a
developing
sentiment
where
people
and
adult
should
be
allowed
to
read
and
see
what
they
want
to
see
and
in
essence,
that’s
what
the
public
said.
now
again,
taking
a
definition,
what
is
a
community
standard,
and
when
we
talk
about
candor,
what
is
the
duty
of
candor?
we
may
tolerate
homosexuality
in
our
society.
it’s
not
our
bag,
but
it's
there,
it
exists,
it's
part
of
it,
but
yet,
if
you
discuss
it,
if
you
depict
it
in
some
ways,
it
maybe
said,
“no,
it’s
wrong
because
that’s
not
what
a
normal
person
does
in
our
society.”
going
on
to
the
concept
of
social
value;
some
jurisdictions
have
eliminated
or
trying
to
eliminate
by
referendum,
the
concept
of
social
value
in
an
obscenity
litigation.
it
is
the
fact
that
a
material
which
is
pruriently
appealing,
it
is
the
fact
that
a
material
exceeds
contemporary
community
standards,
but
if
it
has
some
slight
modicum
of
social
value,
as
the
memoirs
decision,
is
this
enough
to
protect
it
and
communities
are
trying
to
do
way
with
that.
then
there’s
a
problem
of
the
local
versus
the
national
and
how
local
is
local,
and
how
national
is
national.
this
presents
a
problem.
the
courts
are
literally
flooded
with
obscenity
cases
and
i
know
that
this
court
has
a
great
many
of
them
that
have
found
their
way
up
here.
there
are
lots
of
cases
on
appeals
in
federal
courts
and
state
courts
which
are
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case
on
these
issues.
there
are
many
cases
being
made
almost
daily
in
the
lower
courts
and
which
will
ultimately
find
their
way
up
to
the
appellate
courts.
and
depending
on
who
the
judges
are
that
you’re
sitting
in
front
of
and
how
he
views
the
words
of
this
court
in
context
or
out
of
context,
the
jury
instructions
and
such
given,
make
it
very
difficult,
make
it
very
difficult
for
there
to
be
the
uniformity
that
there
should
be
in
the
application
of
a
national
constitution.
and
thus
we
get
back
to
the
point
where
the
focus
we
suggest
should
be
on
conduct.
if
we
want
to
go
out
and
to
talk
about
a
political
candidate,
it's
one
thing,
but
if
we
are
going
to
do
it
at
2
o’clock
in
the
morning
in
a
residential
neighborhood,
then
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
is
ended
right
there.
it’s
not
the
right
of
course
to
do
it
anytime,
anyplace
that
you
want.
you
can’t
block
ingress
and
egress
if
you’re
going
to
do
picketing.
in
the
same
sense
here,
no
one
forces
these
people
to
go
in
this
door.
it
is
the
right
of
the
individual
to
choose
and
if
the
right
of
the
disseminator
here
to
assert
the
right
of
the
citizen
who
might
want
to
see
this,
we’re
doing
this
in
an
essence
if
the
court
were
to
go
to
this
point,
then
the
self
censorship
factor
would
be
eliminated.
and
i
think
that
is
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
in
the
past
in
some
of
his
decisions
that
the
public
would
really
then
be
in
a
position
to
choose,
view,
and
disregard
what
it
is
and
then
it
is
the
mature
and
free
society
that
should
be
allowed
to
make
that
choice.
it
should
not
be
jurors
focused
in
the
public
light
where
they
feel
they
must
react
because
there
is
a
community
pressure
if
they
say
it’s
not
obscene.
somebody
will
think
they
are
dirty
old
men.
this
is
the
concept.
we
eliminate
these
things
by
focusing
on
the
conduct,
so
that
if
there
is
a
public
display,
then
this
is
eliminated.
the
state
of
oregon
for
instance
now
has
litigated
or
has
passed
the
statute
and
there
can
be
no
prosecution
for
obscenity
unless
there
is
a
public
display
of
the
material
by
the
public
highways.
in
an
adult
only
bookstore,
in
an
adult
only
theatre,
it's
okay
as
long
as
they
are
not
juveniles
involved.
the
state
of
hawaii
has
now
passed
the
same
kind
of
law
as
the
state
of
oregon,
again
holding
this.
there
is
--
this
is
the
kind
of
law
that
should
exist
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir
they
are
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir
they
are
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
i
can
furnish
them
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
they
are
the
only
two
states
which
have
thus
far
done
this.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
oregon’s
is
about
a
year
and
four
months
your
honor.
hawaii
is
about
--
for
about
four
or
five
months.
it’s
very
recent
and
we
suggest
this
works.
and
i
have
quoted
extensively
from
professor
emerson’s
book
and
he’s
suggesting
a
solution
to
this
court
to
get
it
out
a
lot
of
the
problems
with
regard
to
obscenity
litigation.
we
think
it
is
a
sound
solution.
the
chief
justice
is
well
known
for
his
views
regarding
the
crowding
of
the
dockets.
we
say
there
is
a
big
way
to
get
a
lot
of
those
cases
out
of
the
way
by
annunciating
the
principle
like
this
which
will
protect
the
shock
that
maybe
found
to
the
public
who
wants
to
avoid
confrontation,
but
at
the
same
time,
giving
the
right
to
the
individual
that
wants
to
view
and
read.
i
would
like
to
save
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
the
point
i’m
making
your
honor
and
i
said
earlier
your
honor,
there
is
no
statute
to
cover
what
they
were
doing.
because
of
the
criminal
statute,
they
sought
to
undertake
and
utilize
a
ad
hoc
procedure.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct
but
relying
upon
the
criminal
statute
for
definitional
purposes
and
of
course
ultimately
they
may
have
decided
to
take
the
films
when
they
obtained
them
as
an
ancillary
proceeding,
instituted
criminal
proceedings.
that’s
the
statute
under
which
they
traveled,
the
definition
under
which
they
traveled
and
of
course
one
of
our
complaints
here
is
that
the
matter
was
simply
an
ad
hoc
proceeding.
it
was
just
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
there
is
no
statutory
authority.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
but
again,
they
approved
the
procedure
in
this
particular
case
but
they
didn’t
say
or
dwell
or
say
that
the
judge
issue
his
opinion
within
so
many
days.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that
the
point
i
was
making.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
sir,
i
don’t
see
that.
mr.
clancy
in
his
brief,
in
the
amicus
brief
seems
to
suggest
that.
i
didn’t
find
that
was
even
an
issue
in
this
case.
there
was
no
--
this
was
not
called
a
noxious
public
nuisance.
it
wasn’t
being
shown
in
outdoor
theatre.
it
was
as
i
said
in
an
indoor
theatre,
and
was
simply
an
effort
to
suppress
the
showing
and
distribution
or
exhibition
of
these
two
films
to
adults.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
i
got
one
this
morning.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
i
just
received
it
this
morning.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
the
first
ruling
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
viewing
it,
as
i
was
responding
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
fact
that
judge
etheridge
did
it
this
way,
“we
are
left
then
to
assert
our
procedural
due
process
in
first
amendment
cases
to
the
efficiency
of
a
particular
judge
in
a
particular
jurisdiction.”
and
that
is
what
i
understood
this
court
meant
in
freedman,
in
teitel
film
corp.
and
other
cases
that
follow
that.
i’d
like
to
save
whatever
few
minutes
i
have
left
if
i
may
to
rebut
mr.
moran's
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
brief
points
please,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
absolutely
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
they
should
be
[voice
overlap]
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
they
should
be.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
think
they
are.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
they
are
and
in
fact
the
oral
testimony
of
one
of
the
police
officers
indicated
what
the
sign
read
on
page
57
i
believe,
of
the
appendix
were
officer
little
said,
“of
course
he
went
to
state
that
no
one
below
21
years
of
age
is
admitted.”
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
we
can
make
them
available,
your
honor.
it
should
in
there
and
i
think
that
the
ones
in
the
appendix
were
copied
from
the
originals,
which
should
be
in
the
record.
the
point
we
made
regarding
expert
witness
testimony,
was
not
so
much
whether
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that’s
the
same.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
same.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
don’t
know
where
they
got
this
from
your
honor,
but
i
would
suppose
that
it
appears
to
be
the
same.
the
point
that
we’re
making,
with
regard
to
expert
witness
testimony
was
that
the
prosecution
should
produce
something
for
the
jury.
these
experts
theoretically
don’t
come
in
and
say
“well
i
think
this
is
obscene,
i
don’t
think
this
is
obscene.”
they’re
talking
and
they
talk
about
some
aspects
of
the
test.
do
these
have
educational
values?
do
these
have
--
do
these
exceed
the
limit
of
candor
tolerated
in
the
community,
in
the
representation
of
sex
and
nudity.
how
else
can
you
get
these
before
a
jury?
we
merely
alluded
to
the
fact
and
have
argued
that
prosecution
should
have
the
affirmative
evidence.
they
not
only
do
not
affirmatively
show
this.
they
say
but
are
just
no
good
because
--
and
if
they
found
someone,
he
would
be
saying
that
it
was
obscene
and
ours
would
say
it
would
not
be
obscene
and
so
really
it’s
a
jury
question
and
the
jury
doesn’t
need
any
experts
to
help
them
one
way
of
the
other.
and
we
say
of
course
that’s
incorrect
and
we
say
that
they
should
have
the
affirmative
responsibility.
the
question
of
--
made
by
mr.
moran
regarding
the
abelson
survey
is
not
entirely
complete
and
accurate.
the
abelson
survey
in
the
commission’s
report
on
pornography
and
obscenity
as
found
at
page
43
of
the
government
printing
office
version
clearly
sets
out
a
national
survey
of
american
public
opinions
sponsored
by
the
commission,
shows
that
the
majority
of
american
adults
believe
that
adult
should
be
allowed
to
read
or
see
any
sexual
materials
they
wish.
now,
the
part
that
mr.
moran
talked
about
was
only
one
aspect
of
another
survey
conducted.
abelson
conducted
numerous
surveys
and
the
one
aspect
that
he
conducted
did
in
fact
talk
about
what
mr.
moran
said,
but
then
the
major
part
of
the
survey
related
to
telling
people,
there
are
bookstores,
there
are
theatres
in
this
nation
which
show
people
engaged
in
sexual
acts
and
nudity,
pictures
of
nudity
and
in
sexual
acts.
and
then
they
went
on
to
ask
the
people
whether
or
not
they
thought
other
should
be
allowed
to
see
this
as
long
as
it
did
not
intrude
on
to
their
privacy.
and
the
majority
of
the
american
people
at
that
time
in
1969
said
yes
and
an
even
larger
majority
of
another
20
points
or
so
said
yes
in
the
early
part
of
1972.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us
is
that
if
we
listen
to
these
factors,
we
see
there’s
a
lot
of
confusion
and
trying
to
apply
what
this
court
set
out,
thinking
perhaps
it
was
a
good
solid
solution,
aligned,
limiting,
and
saying
what
is
obscene
and
what
is
not
obscene.
this
has
been
construed
in
very
many
ways
and
a
lot
of
other
problems
have
come
back,
and
what
it
really
has
to
do
with
it,
is
we're
saying
that
this
court
should
hold
to
the
position
that
we
are
trying
to
suggest
and
that
is,
that
when
we
should
change
the
focus
from
the
expression
itself
to
the
conduct,
i
would
say
that
there
is
just
complete
confusion
that
has
existed,
it
is
clearly
as
apparent
in
the
many
petitions
that
this
court
must
receive
in
the
trials
below
and
the
only
value
that
the
surveys
have
were
just
merely
i
was
commenting
to
mr.
moran’s
point
and
to
let
the
court
know
that
it
wasn’t
just
that
point,
that
the
abelson
survey
was
based
on.
he
indicated
the
whole
report,
the
conclusions
of
the
majority
were
based
on
abelson
survey
and
the
way
they
are
asking
a
particular
question.
we
again
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
he
talking
about
focusing
on
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
focusing
on
the
conduct
of
what’s
depicted
in
the
film.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
i
was
talking
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
conduct
that
thrust
itself
upon
an
unwilling
public,
the
conduct
that
interferes
with
my
rights
and
when
i
don’t
want
to
view
something.
and
as
i
said
your
honor,
here
is
part
of
the
problem
now.
mr.
justice
burger
asked
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
would
limit
it
to
the
situation
as
i
said
where
minors
are
involved
and
to
those
ways
of
dissemination
which
intrude
into
the
privacy
of
unwilling
individuals.
when
there
is
an
intrusion,
then
the
definition
of
what
is
obscene
becomes
constitutionally
relevant.
some
women
and
some
men,
they
say
things
that
time
magazine
because
it
may
show
two
or
three
nudes
is
obscene,
like
the
post
office.
and
then
the
post
office
would
make
an
analysis
whether
applying
this
court’s
definition,
is
it
obscene?
sure
the
intrusion
occurred,
they
are
in
right
time.
that’s
when
it
becomes
relevant.
we
say
your
honors
that
these
films
do
not
--
are
not
as
represented
by
counsel
here
for
the
government,
they
do
contain
sexually
frank
scenes
but
there
are
no
instances
of
sexual
consummation,
explicitly
portrayed.
taking
in
part
the
words
from
the
rabe
versus
washington
case,
they
don’t
exist
and
this
is
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct
and
i’m
really,
again
[voice
overlap]
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
on
the
question
of
the
procedure,
mr.
justice
burger
inquired
regarding
the
procedure,
how
this
came
about,
what
is
the
current
procedure
today,
and
one
of
the
things
i
was
pointing
out
was,
it
was
pointed
out
by
brother,
there
was
an
answer
he
would
make
an
affidavit
as
to
what
was
being
shown
but
no
people
can
agree
on
what
was
being
shown.
the
trial
judge
said
it
did
not
show
explicit
sexual
acts.
my
brother
says
it
does
show
explicit
sexual
acts.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that
is
in
the
context
of
our
fourth
argument.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
irrelevant
as
to
that
argument
on
point
number
four,
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
originated
in
the
city
of
atlanta
when
the
respondents
filed
a
complaint
seeking
in
essence
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
to
prohibit
of
the
showing
of
two
movies.
this
comes
about
because
the
theatre,
the
paris
adult
theatre,
had
two
separate
sections
to
it
where
separate
films
were
being
shown
and
one
would
walk
in
to
the
cashier
and
go
in
one
or
go
in
the
other.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
common
lobby,
yes
sir.
and
then
the
door
would
open
to
the
particular
film
they
wanted
to
go
see.
the
complaint
filed
by
the
prosecutor,
by
the
prosecution
or
the
respondents
in
this
case
sought
a
temporary
injunction
to
stop
the
showing
of
the
film
pending
the
hearing
on
the
permanent
injunction.
fortuitously,
the
judge
did
not
sign
that
broad
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
merely
to
sought
to
stop
the
petitioners
in
this
case
from
taking
the
films
out
of
the
jurisdiction
or
altering,
or
removing
them.
a
hearing
was
scheduled
in
january
and
ultimately
on
january
13th,
1971
the
films
were
produced.
their
evidence
produced
before
the
court
indicated
that
this
theatre
had
its
outside
was
painted
so
that
no
one
could
see
inside
and
there
were
several
legends
on
the
windows,
to
the
extent
for
adults
only,
you
must
be
21
and
be
able
to
prove
it.
if
viewing
the
nude
body
offends
you,
do
not
enter.
the
fore
warning
of
the
character
of
the
material
which
one
might
expect
to
find
therein
was
clearly
stated
on
the
outside.
the
prosecution
at
the
time
of
the
presentation
of
its
case,
brought
in
several
witnesses
who
had
viewed
the
movie.
these
were
investigators
in
the
office
of
the
solicitor,
and
they
indicated
that
these
films
showed
explicit
sexual
acts
of
cunnilingual,
fellatio,
and
intercourse.
the
trial
judge,
after
viewing
the
movies
found
they
did
not
show
these
explicit
acts.
they
were
simulated.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said,
“well,
it
doesn’t
leave
really
much
to
the
imagination
and
its
close
enough.
and
besides,
we
thought
the
acts
which
in
essence
were
simulated
in
i
am
curious
(yellow),
that
this
is
the
same
kind
of
thing,
we
thought
was
obscene
in
i
am
curious
(yellow),
and
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
has
not
reversed
in
that
case,
and
so
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
this
is
hardcore
pornography.”
that
was
just
the
title
they
threw
on
it.
even
though
there
were
no
explicit
sexual
acts
consummated
in
this
particular
film,
sort
of
in
a
sense
of
the
language
of
this
court
in
rabe
versus
washington,
when
it
was
talking
about
certain
types
of
films.
the
court
as
i
said
issued
its
order
and
held
these
were
not
hardcore
pornography,
that
there
were
no
minors
involved,
and
that
as
far
as
the
court
was
concerned,
they
were
tasteless,
vulgar,
childish,
unimaginative,
boring,
but
as
far
its
concern,
it
was
protected
by
the
constitution.
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
and
we
are
here
on
this
issue.
we
pointed
out
initially
in
our
brief
that
the
procedural
--
there
were
no
procedural
guidelines
for
this
taking
process
in
the
state.
there
is
no
statute
that
permits
this,
there
is
no
authority,
no
judicial
construction
that
will
say,
that
as
far
as
the
court
will
hear
it
on
a
certain
day,
the
court
will
decide
within
a
certain
number
of
days
as
to
its
decision
in
this
particular
matter.
we
say
the
procedural
safeguards
are
lacking.
they
are
not
there,
but
yet
the
state
has
or
been
allowed
to
do
it
in
this
manner.
but
more
importantly,
we’d
like
to
direct
their
argument
to
the
question
suggested
by
this
court
with
regard
to
the
display
of
sexually
oriented
films.
my
brother
in
his
brief
would
interpret
the
terminology,
any
sexually
oriented
films
as
meaning
obscene
films.
i
interpret
that
in
slightly
different
way.
we
view
this
as
being
whatever
the
definition,
whatever
definition
of
the
members
of
this
court,
whatever
definition
is
supplied
by
statute,
whether
it's
something
to
the
left
of
pinocchio
on
up
to
the
extremes
that
mr.
moran
has
cited
in
his
brief,
whatever
--
however
will
you
define,
whatever
denominator
you
use
to
define
and
aside
from
the
specific
definition,
is
there
a
constitutional
right
to
offer
this
for
dissemination
in
a
commercial
theatre
where
there
are
no
children
admitted
and
where
there
are
some
note
of
notice,
some
warning
on
the
outside
of
the
theatre
as
to
the
character
of
the
material
being
offered
there.
now
my
brother
would
say,
“yes,
but
there
was
no
sign
that
said
cunnilingual
activity
depicted,
no
sign
that
said
fellatio,
just
said
if
the
nude
body
offends
you,
please
don’t
enter.”
but
the
first
time
we
put
a
sign
out
that
said,
cunnilingual
activity
in,
fellatio
in,
they
maybe
hauling
us
in
and
charging
us
with
pandering,
which
in
essence
what
they
did
in
other
cases
in
that
jurisdiction
where
that
particular
matter
was
present
on
the
outside
of
the
theatre.
so
in
this
context,
this
is
what
we
have.
addressing
ourselves
to
the
greater
point,
we
don’t
think
that
roth
necessarily
is
inconsistent
with
the
argument
we’re
making
today.
this
court
in
essence
did
say
in
roth
that
“yes,
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.”
but
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
door
barring
federal
encroachment
into
this
area
must
be
kept
tightly
closed
to
prevent
encroachment
upon
more
important
interest.
we
suggest
that
the
redrup
cases
which
in
essence
started
a
trend
in
which
there
are
approximately
33
or
34
cases
reversed
per
curiam,
let
us
gently
from
a
point
of
focusing
on
the
expression,
to
focusing
on
conduct.
it
is
as
mr.
fliesman
pointed
out
with
regard
to
the
california
attorney
general
who
was
walking
down
the
street
last
night,
we
do
not
have
in
this
record
any
reference
to
anyone
standing
outside
of
the
theatre
and
hustling
them
in
as
you
might
find
at
a
night
club
or
something
like
that,
nothing
whatsoever.
there
is
absolutely
no
hustling
or
any
way
pandering,
however,
you
might
define
those
terms
involved
in
this
case.
we
suggest
that
the
right
of
the
disseminator
to
assert
his
position
although
he
is
not
necessarily
the
viewer,
is
clear
from
a
variety
of
cases
held
by
this
court.
one
of
the
key
points
that
the
court
has
made
with
regards
to
first
amendment,
is
that
if
they
are
not
the
procedural
safeguards,
we
are
going
to
have
an
inducement
of
self
censorship
and
when
one
induces
the
self
censorship,
then
in
essence
the
public
is
the
loser.
the
public
is
the
loser
and
in
prosecutions
undertaken
without
--
in
this
context,
sure
they
can
be
punished
if
there
is
going
to
be
an
intrusion,
but
we
do
not
have
it
in
this
case.
there
is
not
in
this
case
the
problem
that
might
be
presented
in
a
magazine
or
a
bookstore
where
the
book
is
taken
out
of
the
store
and
left
in
a
trashcan,
and
the
possibility
it
maybe
found
by
children.
we
have
a
film,
in
a
commercial
theatre
where
people
can
go
and
view
it.
in
carr
lexus
versus
burn
reversed
by
this
court
on
other
grounds,
the
lower
court
held
that
if
stanley
in
essence
can
watch
a
film
of
any
kind,
any
sexually
oriented
film,
sexually
explicit
film
in
the
privacy
of
his
home,
why
can’t
a
few
fellows
get
together
and
watch
it
in
a
commercial
setting
and
have
just
the
same
sense
of
privacy
and
the
same
sense
of
protection
and
we
suggest
that
makes
good
sense.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
approximately
600
millions
of
dollars
are
spent
in
a
year
on
the
sale
of
and
or
exhibition
of
sexually
explicit
material
and
that’s
an
awful
lot
of
public
support
for
an
interest
in
sexually
explicit
material.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
would
say
your
honor,
a
great
deal.
i’m
sure
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
i
think
mr.
clancy,
my
brother
who
has
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case
probably
would
feel
they
will
be
put
out
of
work,
but
in
this
context,
we
think
that
the
focus
on
action
on
the
conduct
of
the
disseminator
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
protection
of
the
right
of
the
public
under
the
first
amendment.
we
are
not
as
in
reidel
conceding
that
these
films
are
obscene.
in
reidel
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion
to
dismiss,
there
was
a
concession
that
for
that
matter
assume
the
films
are
obscene.
we’re
saying
something
different.
we’re
saying
that
the
definition
of
whether
the
films
are
obscene,
is
not
relevant
until
an
impermissible
intrusion
occurs
by
the
act
of
the
disseminator
in
thrusting
upon
someone
or
by
having
involved
with
minors
in
that
particular
case,
just
does
not
exist
here.
so
we
say
it
is
not
inconsistent
for
this
to
have
occurred.
we
also
have
argued
and
set
forth
that
the
film
itself,
regardless
of
the
argument
that
we
make
on
the
right
of
an
adult,
the
right
of
a
disseminator
to
show
films
in
a
adult
theatre,
that
these
films
are
not
obscene.
they
are
not
unlike
films
for
instance
involved
in
the
hartstein
case,
films
that
were
involved
in
a
wiener
case.
and
these
points
out
the
difficulty
we
suggest
why
this
court
shouldn’t
annunciate
broader
protection
and
a
positive
protection
to
eliminate
the
difficulty
inherent
in
trying
to
fit
a
definition
because
in
some
states,
prurient
interest
is
defined
as
shameful
and
morbid.
now
there
is
--
it
is
an
itching
sensation,
i
think
using
the
term
--
some
of
the
terminology
taken
from
a
marginal
note
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
roth
case
using
that
phraseology.
and
then
prurient
means
so
many
different
things
to
so
many
different
people
and
then
the
question
of
community
standards.
are
we
talking
about
some
standard
to
which
we
all
should
aspire?
getting
married
for
life
and
never
having
an
extra
marital
affair
and
never
getting
divorced.
but
is
that
what
the
community
really
does?
sure!
that
is
something.
that
is
the
ideal,
that’s
what
we
really
hope
aspire
to
but
then
in
this
context,
is
the
community
standard,
that
which
we
should
aspire
to,
or
is
it
that
which
we
find
ourselves
in
today
and
is
there
a
single
standard
in
our
community?
we
suggest
there
is
not.
there
are
many
--
there’s
a
standard
of
different
groups.
it's
clear
in
surveys
taken
whether
they
are
political
surveys,
whether
they’re
sex
research
surveys,
that
there
is
a
conservative
element
in
our
society,
there
is
a
liberal
element
in
our
society,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
just
don’t
care
one
way
or
the
other
or
at
least
don’t
show
a
great
deal
of
positive
interest
in
responding.
we’ve
indicated
that
there
were
community
attitude
surveys
by
the
presidential
commission
on
pornography
and
obscenity,
where
several
millions
of
dollars
were
spent,
taking
a
survey
on
a
demographic
basis
throughout
the
united
states.
and
one
of
the
conclusions
were
that
many
people
felt
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
reidel
that
there
is
a
developing
sentiment
where
people
and
adult
should
be
allowed
to
read
and
see
what
they
want
to
see
and
in
essence,
that’s
what
the
public
said.
now
again,
taking
a
definition,
what
is
a
community
standard,
and
when
we
talk
about
candor,
what
is
the
duty
of
candor?
we
may
tolerate
homosexuality
in
our
society.
it’s
not
our
bag,
but
it's
there,
it
exists,
it's
part
of
it,
but
yet,
if
you
discuss
it,
if
you
depict
it
in
some
ways,
it
maybe
said,
“no,
it’s
wrong
because
that’s
not
what
a
normal
person
does
in
our
society.”
going
on
to
the
concept
of
social
value;
some
jurisdictions
have
eliminated
or
trying
to
eliminate
by
referendum,
the
concept
of
social
value
in
an
obscenity
litigation.
it
is
the
fact
that
a
material
which
is
pruriently
appealing,
it
is
the
fact
that
a
material
exceeds
contemporary
community
standards,
but
if
it
has
some
slight
modicum
of
social
value,
as
the
memoirs
decision,
is
this
enough
to
protect
it
and
communities
are
trying
to
do
way
with
that.
then
there’s
a
problem
of
the
local
versus
the
national
and
how
local
is
local,
and
how
national
is
national.
this
presents
a
problem.
the
courts
are
literally
flooded
with
obscenity
cases
and
i
know
that
this
court
has
a
great
many
of
them
that
have
found
their
way
up
here.
there
are
lots
of
cases
on
appeals
in
federal
courts
and
state
courts
which
are
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case
on
these
issues.
there
are
many
cases
being
made
almost
daily
in
the
lower
courts
and
which
will
ultimately
find
their
way
up
to
the
appellate
courts.
and
depending
on
who
the
judges
are
that
you’re
sitting
in
front
of
and
how
he
views
the
words
of
this
court
in
context
or
out
of
context,
the
jury
instructions
and
such
given,
make
it
very
difficult,
make
it
very
difficult
for
there
to
be
the
uniformity
that
there
should
be
in
the
application
of
a
national
constitution.
and
thus
we
get
back
to
the
point
where
the
focus
we
suggest
should
be
on
conduct.
if
we
want
to
go
out
and
to
talk
about
a
political
candidate,
it's
one
thing,
but
if
we
are
going
to
do
it
at
2
o’clock
in
the
morning
in
a
residential
neighborhood,
then
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
is
ended
right
there.
it’s
not
the
right
of
course
to
do
it
anytime,
anyplace
that
you
want.
you
can’t
block
ingress
and
egress
if
you’re
going
to
do
picketing.
in
the
same
sense
here,
no
one
forces
these
people
to
go
in
this
door.
it
is
the
right
of
the
individual
to
choose
and
if
the
right
of
the
disseminator
here
to
assert
the
right
of
the
citizen
who
might
want
to
see
this,
we’re
doing
this
in
an
essence
if
the
court
were
to
go
to
this
point,
then
the
self
censorship
factor
would
be
eliminated.
and
i
think
that
is
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
in
the
past
in
some
of
his
decisions
that
the
public
would
really
then
be
in
a
position
to
choose,
view,
and
disregard
what
it
is
and
then
it
is
the
mature
and
free
society
that
should
be
allowed
to
make
that
choice.
it
should
not
be
jurors
focused
in
the
public
light
where
they
feel
they
must
react
because
there
is
a
community
pressure
if
they
say
it’s
not
obscene.
somebody
will
think
they
are
dirty
old
men.
this
is
the
concept.
we
eliminate
these
things
by
focusing
on
the
conduct,
so
that
if
there
is
a
public
display,
then
this
is
eliminated.
the
state
of
oregon
for
instance
now
has
litigated
or
has
passed
the
statute
and
there
can
be
no
prosecution
for
obscenity
unless
there
is
a
public
display
of
the
material
by
the
public
highways.
in
an
adult
only
bookstore,
in
an
adult
only
theatre,
it's
okay
as
long
as
they
are
not
juveniles
involved.
the
state
of
hawaii
has
now
passed
the
same
kind
of
law
as
the
state
of
oregon,
again
holding
this.
there
is
--
this
is
the
kind
of
law
that
should
exist
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir
they
are
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir
they
are
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
i
can
furnish
them
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
they
are
the
only
two
states
which
have
thus
far
done
this.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
oregon’s
is
about
a
year
and
four
months
your
honor.
hawaii
is
about
--
for
about
four
or
five
months.
it’s
very
recent
and
we
suggest
this
works.
and
i
have
quoted
extensively
from
professor
emerson’s
book
and
he’s
suggesting
a
solution
to
this
court
to
get
it
out
a
lot
of
the
problems
with
regard
to
obscenity
litigation.
we
think
it
is
a
sound
solution.
the
chief
justice
is
well
known
for
his
views
regarding
the
crowding
of
the
dockets.
we
say
there
is
a
big
way
to
get
a
lot
of
those
cases
out
of
the
way
by
annunciating
the
principle
like
this
which
will
protect
the
shock
that
maybe
found
to
the
public
who
wants
to
avoid
confrontation,
but
at
the
same
time,
giving
the
right
to
the
individual
that
wants
to
view
and
read.
i
would
like
to
save
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
the
point
i’m
making
your
honor
and
i
said
earlier
your
honor,
there
is
no
statute
to
cover
what
they
were
doing.
because
of
the
criminal
statute,
they
sought
to
undertake
and
utilize
a
ad
hoc
procedure.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct
but
relying
upon
the
criminal
statute
for
definitional
purposes
and
of
course
ultimately
they
may
have
decided
to
take
the
films
when
they
obtained
them
as
an
ancillary
proceeding,
instituted
criminal
proceedings.
that’s
the
statute
under
which
they
traveled,
the
definition
under
which
they
traveled
and
of
course
one
of
our
complaints
here
is
that
the
matter
was
simply
an
ad
hoc
proceeding.
it
was
just
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
there
is
no
statutory
authority.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
but
again,
they
approved
the
procedure
in
this
particular
case
but
they
didn’t
say
or
dwell
or
say
that
the
judge
issue
his
opinion
within
so
many
days.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that
the
point
i
was
making.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
sir,
i
don’t
see
that.
mr.
clancy
in
his
brief,
in
the
amicus
brief
seems
to
suggest
that.
i
didn’t
find
that
was
even
an
issue
in
this
case.
there
was
no
--
this
was
not
called
a
noxious
public
nuisance.
it
wasn’t
being
shown
in
outdoor
theatre.
it
was
as
i
said
in
an
indoor
theatre,
and
was
simply
an
effort
to
suppress
the
showing
and
distribution
or
exhibition
of
these
two
films
to
adults.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
i
got
one
this
morning.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
i
just
received
it
this
morning.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
the
first
ruling
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
viewing
it,
as
i
was
responding
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
fact
that
judge
etheridge
did
it
this
way,
“we
are
left
then
to
assert
our
procedural
due
process
in
first
amendment
cases
to
the
efficiency
of
a
particular
judge
in
a
particular
jurisdiction.”
and
that
is
what
i
understood
this
court
meant
in
freedman,
in
teitel
film
corp.
and
other
cases
that
follow
that.
i’d
like
to
save
whatever
few
minutes
i
have
left
if
i
may
to
rebut
mr.
moran's
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
brief
points
please,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
absolutely
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
they
should
be
[voice
overlap]
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
they
should
be.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
think
they
are.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
they
are
and
in
fact
the
oral
testimony
of
one
of
the
police
officers
indicated
what
the
sign
read
on
page
57
i
believe,
of
the
appendix
were
officer
little
said,
“of
course
he
went
to
state
that
no
one
below
21
years
of
age
is
admitted.”
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
we
can
make
them
available,
your
honor.
it
should
in
there
and
i
think
that
the
ones
in
the
appendix
were
copied
from
the
originals,
which
should
be
in
the
record.
the
point
we
made
regarding
expert
witness
testimony,
was
not
so
much
whether
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that’s
the
same.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
same.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
don’t
know
where
they
got
this
from
your
honor,
but
i
would
suppose
that
it
appears
to
be
the
same.
the
point
that
we’re
making,
with
regard
to
expert
witness
testimony
was
that
the
prosecution
should
produce
something
for
the
jury.
these
experts
theoretically
don’t
come
in
and
say
“well
i
think
this
is
obscene,
i
don’t
think
this
is
obscene.”
they’re
talking
and
they
talk
about
some
aspects
of
the
test.
do
these
have
educational
values?
do
these
have
--
do
these
exceed
the
limit
of
candor
tolerated
in
the
community,
in
the
representation
of
sex
and
nudity.
how
else
can
you
get
these
before
a
jury?
we
merely
alluded
to
the
fact
and
have
argued
that
prosecution
should
have
the
affirmative
evidence.
they
not
only
do
not
affirmatively
show
this.
they
say
but
are
just
no
good
because
--
and
if
they
found
someone,
he
would
be
saying
that
it
was
obscene
and
ours
would
say
it
would
not
be
obscene
and
so
really
it’s
a
jury
question
and
the
jury
doesn’t
need
any
experts
to
help
them
one
way
of
the
other.
and
we
say
of
course
that’s
incorrect
and
we
say
that
they
should
have
the
affirmative
responsibility.
the
question
of
--
made
by
mr.
moran
regarding
the
abelson
survey
is
not
entirely
complete
and
accurate.
the
abelson
survey
in
the
commission’s
report
on
pornography
and
obscenity
as
found
at
page
43
of
the
government
printing
office
version
clearly
sets
out
a
national
survey
of
american
public
opinions
sponsored
by
the
commission,
shows
that
the
majority
of
american
adults
believe
that
adult
should
be
allowed
to
read
or
see
any
sexual
materials
they
wish.
now,
the
part
that
mr.
moran
talked
about
was
only
one
aspect
of
another
survey
conducted.
abelson
conducted
numerous
surveys
and
the
one
aspect
that
he
conducted
did
in
fact
talk
about
what
mr.
moran
said,
but
then
the
major
part
of
the
survey
related
to
telling
people,
there
are
bookstores,
there
are
theatres
in
this
nation
which
show
people
engaged
in
sexual
acts
and
nudity,
pictures
of
nudity
and
in
sexual
acts.
and
then
they
went
on
to
ask
the
people
whether
or
not
they
thought
other
should
be
allowed
to
see
this
as
long
as
it
did
not
intrude
on
to
their
privacy.
and
the
majority
of
the
american
people
at
that
time
in
1969
said
yes
and
an
even
larger
majority
of
another
20
points
or
so
said
yes
in
the
early
part
of
1972.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us
is
that
if
we
listen
to
these
factors,
we
see
there’s
a
lot
of
confusion
and
trying
to
apply
what
this
court
set
out,
thinking
perhaps
it
was
a
good
solid
solution,
aligned,
limiting,
and
saying
what
is
obscene
and
what
is
not
obscene.
this
has
been
construed
in
very
many
ways
and
a
lot
of
other
problems
have
come
back,
and
what
it
really
has
to
do
with
it,
is
we're
saying
that
this
court
should
hold
to
the
position
that
we
are
trying
to
suggest
and
that
is,
that
when
we
should
change
the
focus
from
the
expression
itself
to
the
conduct,
i
would
say
that
there
is
just
complete
confusion
that
has
existed,
it
is
clearly
as
apparent
in
the
many
petitions
that
this
court
must
receive
in
the
trials
below
and
the
only
value
that
the
surveys
have
were
just
merely
i
was
commenting
to
mr.
moran’s
point
and
to
let
the
court
know
that
it
wasn’t
just
that
point,
that
the
abelson
survey
was
based
on.
he
indicated
the
whole
report,
the
conclusions
of
the
majority
were
based
on
abelson
survey
and
the
way
they
are
asking
a
particular
question.
we
again
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
he
talking
about
focusing
on
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
focusing
on
the
conduct
of
what’s
depicted
in
the
film.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
i
was
talking
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
conduct
that
thrust
itself
upon
an
unwilling
public,
the
conduct
that
interferes
with
my
rights
and
when
i
don’t
want
to
view
something.
and
as
i
said
your
honor,
here
is
part
of
the
problem
now.
mr.
justice
burger
asked
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
would
limit
it
to
the
situation
as
i
said
where
minors
are
involved
and
to
those
ways
of
dissemination
which
intrude
into
the
privacy
of
unwilling
individuals.
when
there
is
an
intrusion,
then
the
definition
of
what
is
obscene
becomes
constitutionally
relevant.
some
women
and
some
men,
they
say
things
that
time
magazine
because
it
may
show
two
or
three
nudes
is
obscene,
like
the
post
office.
and
then
the
post
office
would
make
an
analysis
whether
applying
this
court’s
definition,
is
it
obscene?
sure
the
intrusion
occurred,
they
are
in
right
time.
that’s
when
it
becomes
relevant.
we
say
your
honors
that
these
films
do
not
--
are
not
as
represented
by
counsel
here
for
the
government,
they
do
contain
sexually
frank
scenes
but
there
are
no
instances
of
sexual
consummation,
explicitly
portrayed.
taking
in
part
the
words
from
the
rabe
versus
washington
case,
they
don’t
exist
and
this
is
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct
and
i’m
really,
again
[voice
overlap]
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
on
the
question
of
the
procedure,
mr.
justice
burger
inquired
regarding
the
procedure,
how
this
came
about,
what
is
the
current
procedure
today,
and
one
of
the
things
i
was
pointing
out
was,
it
was
pointed
out
by
brother,
there
was
an
answer
he
would
make
an
affidavit
as
to
what
was
being
shown
but
no
people
can
agree
on
what
was
being
shown.
the
trial
judge
said
it
did
not
show
explicit
sexual
acts.
my
brother
says
it
does
show
explicit
sexual
acts.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
that
is
in
the
context
of
our
fourth
argument.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
irrelevant
as
to
that
argument
on
point
number
four,
yes
sir.
thank
you.
