in
fact
here
the
judge
took
an
unduly
long
time
on
the
facts
here
he
did,
but
because
there
were
no
guidelines
another
judge
might
have?

justice

rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
question
relating
or
attempting
to
relate
the
question
the
court
asked
to
be
argued
to
the
state
of
the
record
here?
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
record
made
in
the
trial
court
is
silent
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
pandering
or
juvenile
attendance
and
that
sort
of
thing,
so
in
effect
whichever
party
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
point
would
lose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
evidence
that
there
wasn’t
pandering
or
exposure
to
juveniles?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

feel
it
was
silent
then?
