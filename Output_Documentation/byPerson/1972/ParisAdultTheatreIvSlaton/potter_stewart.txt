justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
common
lobby
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
dollars
are
spent
in
efforts
to
suppress
it
by
local
and
the
state
police
and
federal?
justice
potter
stewart
a
lot
of
people
will
be
put
out
of
work
though
--[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
jury
in
this
case,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
indeed
it
was
a
proceeding
in
the
nature
of
an
equitable
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
you
say
in
your
brief
that
the
relevant
statutes
and
the
constitutional
provisions
are
in
certiorari
petition
and
i
picked
that
up
and
all
i
find
is
a
criminal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well
of
course
if
the
court’s
of
georgia
say
that
that’s
a
procedure
available
under
georgia
law,
i
suppose
that’s
the
end
of
it
as
far
we
are
concerned.
although,
apparently,
there’s
no
statutory
authority
there
of
hand?
justice
potter
stewart
one
must
proceeded
by
the
georgian
courts
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
mentioned
an
amicus
brief,
i
don’t
seem
to
have
one,
who
filed
this
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
the
film
was
produced
in
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
shown
to
the
court,
and
then
after
it
was
returned
to
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
have
--
if
they
have
more
than
one
print
of
the
film?
justice
potter
stewart
describe
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
a
picture
of
the
building
i
think
in
the
amicus
brief
on
f,
right
at
the
end
of
the
amicus
brief.
i
guess
the
theater,
atlanta’s
finest
mature
entertainment.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
exhibit.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
reproduction
of
the
actual
exhibit?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
this
really
got
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
conduct?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
brother
asked
us
to
do,
asked
the
court
to
do
exactly
what
you’re
asking
us
to
do,
focus
on
the
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
asking
me
to
do
the
same,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
the
conduct
of
conducting
a
movie
theatre
is
what
he
was
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
you
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
limit
it
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
they
did,
would
you
--
that
doesn’t
come
out
of
your
--
that
wouldn’t
be
within
either
one
of
your
exceptions
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
that
is
basically
an
irrelevant
inquiry
under
your
submission
that
it’s
permissible
in
any
event,
so
long
as
there’s
not
an
assault
on
the
privacy
of
unwilling
people
and
so
long
as
that
is
not
exposed
to
children,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
question
is
irrelevant
to
your
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
common
lobby
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
