mr.
harry
f.
cole
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
is
and
i
think
that
possibly
to
focus
upon
the
issues
which
duly
present
here.
i
might
make
this
statement
at
outset,
and
that
is
that
in
our
view
in
the
study
of
the
district
court’s
opinion,
the
three-judge
district
court
held
nothing
unconstitutional.
no
statute
was
held
unconstitutional.
the
only
effect
of
the
courts
decision
and
opinion
being
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
holding
that
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
point
of
my
saying
is,
your
honor,
that
i
think
we
are
going
to
get
back
to
a
regular
1983
case
and
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
district
court
should
have
exercise
equity
jurisdiction
to
enjoin?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
right,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
yes
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes
--
no,
sir.
no,
sir
before
an
administrative
board
to
revoke
the
appellees
licenses
to
practice.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir,
inadequate
as
we
contended
in
the
court
below.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
de
novo.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
in
our
opinion
the
judgment,
there
was
no
absolute
right
supersedeas.
alabama
case
hold
that
supersedeas
is
not
a
matter
of
right
and
unless
granted
by
statute
must
be
directed
to
one
of
the
circuit
judges
and
if
the
circuit
judge
has
authority
to
issue
a
writ
of
supersedeas
at
law
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
the
case
was
state
v.
keel
cited
by
the
appellant
involved
the
fact
situation
where
the
department
of
conservation
had
issued
some
regulation
prohibiting
trotline
fishing
in
the
river
in
alabama.
and
the
defendant
was
arrested
for
trotline
fishing
and
they
held
that
they
could
issue
a
warrant
on
this.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir,
but
the
facts
here
additionally,
we
contend
and
we
thank
the
record
as
replete
with
examples
of
vast
prejudice
and
disqualification
on
the
part
of
the
tribunal
who
where
--
who
what,
which
was
to
try
these
defendants,
and
that’s
the
basis
we
ask
for
the
injunction
in
the
first
place.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
administrative
supersedeas,
your
honor,
was
nothing
more
than
administrative
grace
in
this
instance.
there
had
been
no
right
to
supersedeas
after
this
action
was
filed.
after
the
board
members
had
refused
to
recuse
themselves
at
our
request,
we
filed
a
suit
and
asked
if
they
be
enjoined.
after
the
suit
was
filed
and
while
it
was
pending,
then
they
past
regulation
number
one
which
was
the
first
regulation
the
alabama
state
board
of
optometry
had
passed
in
some
40
years.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir
because
i
don’t
think
administrative
board
can
pass
a
statute
allowing
supersedeas.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir
but
the
regulation
could
be
revoked
as
easily
as
it
was
passed.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
your
honor,
they
said
they
would
and
after
this
suit
was
filed.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir
except
if
i
may
recite
the
history
of
this
litigation
and
the
background
which
we
claim
shows
the
disqualification
on
the
part
of
the
board.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
mandamus
was
available
on
the
state
side
to
require
that
board
members
to
recuse
themselves,
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
because
we
thought
we
had
concurrent
federal
jurisdiction
on
the
1983.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
i
will
just
mention
the
geiger
case
to
get
it
behind
this
right
now.
this
was
the
proceeding
to
revoke
the
license
of
a
doctor
in
the
state
of
georgia,
and
that
--
i
forgot
whether
it
was
this
court
or
the
district
court
refused
to
issue
an
injunction
because
there
was
no
allegation
that
he
would
be
denied
due
process
in
the
first
instance,
or
that
he
could
not
avail
himself
of
constitutional
defense,
and
the
defense
of
a
single
criminal
action.
in
this
case,
we
allege
that
they
could
not
get
due
process
in
the
first
instance,
and
that
we
have
been
subjected
to
harassment.
but
it
would
be
--
deprive
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
and
for
that
reason,
we
invoked
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
under
1983.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
your
honor,
the
denial
of
due
process
we
feel
would
be
number
one
and
either
making
us
go
before
board,
which
we
think
this
court
will
recognize
--
just
obviously
disqualified,
or
pursuing
a
mandamus
remedy.
in
the
state
court,
it
tried
to
require
them
to
recuse
themselves
and
also
having
some
question
about
supersedeas
during
which
time
these
people
are
deprived
of
the
right
to
practice
their
profession,
with
the
attempt
of
embarrassment
and
trouble
that
they
might
face
by
having
been
--
having
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
by
injunction
probably.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
and
i
might
add
the
state
court
which
too
which
we
would
have
to
apply
with
the
same
one
and
then
just
enjoin
the
same
optometrists
are
enjoined
lee
optical
from
employing
the
same
optometrist.
the
decision
are
in
which
was
later
reversed
and
rendered
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
if
the
state
courts
where
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
yes,
sir.
i
mean,
that
is
where
we
were.
we
were
in
the
same
position.
we
think
as
the
defendants
were
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
whether
or
not
we
could
have
defended
this
in
the
single
action,
of
course,
we
think
it
is
a
question
for
the
court.
if
i
may
review
the
history
and
what
the
record
was
shown,
the
record
is
voluminous
in
its
appeal
with
that.
the
appendix
has
some
400
or
500
pages
of
testimony
in
here
from
the
state
board
members,
that
position
were
taken
from
each
of
them.
the
history
of
this
litigation
goes
back
to
old
1956,
the
first
that
the
two
alabama
state
statutes
giving
the
board
the
authority
to
regulate
the
practice
of
optometry
are
sections
206
and
then
addition
there,
some
other
section.
one
of
the
sections
says
that
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
be
deemed
to
deny
the
right
of
a
department
store
or
some
other
business
to
operate
in
optometrical
department.
assuming
that
it’s
under
the
control
of
a
licensed
optometrist
and
that
his
name
appears
in
any
advertisement,
there
have
been
prosecution
of
several
or
one
or
two
at
least
optometrist,
under
this
act
holding
that
there
where
guilty
of
unprofessional
conduct
because
their
name
had
appeared
in
advertising.
the
board
prosecuted
these
people
because
they
said
that
they
violated
the
code
of
ethics
of
the
alabama
optometric
association.
the
alabama
optometric
association
has
given
the
authority
by
the
legislature
to
admit
members
to
practice
and
govern
the
practice
of
the
profession
within
alabama
in
code
--
state
code.
the
alabama
optometric
association
also
nominates
the
members
of
the
alabama
state
board
and
board
members
must
come
from
the
association.
also,
in
the
record
or
in
the
rules
of
the
alabama
optometric
association
is
a
provision
which
says
that
any
optometrist
who
is
employed
by
anybody
other
than
a
licensed
optometrist
cannot
join
the
association.
so
that
optometrist
who
are
employed
by
corporations
or
optical
dispensaries
are
excluded
from
membership
and
the
organization
govern
the
practice
of
their
profession.
now,
the
association
and
the
state
board
had
admittedly
these
stipulated
mr.
billups
stated
in
his
statement
had
been
engaged
for
many
years
and
had
been
interested
in
eliminating
what
they
refer
to
as
corporate
practice
of
optometry
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
other
states.
that
is
that
the
practice
by
which
an
optometrist
maybe
employed
by
an
optical
dispensary.
in
alabama,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
there
are
a
hundred
members
of
the
alabama
state
board
of
optometry.
there
are
92
members
of
these
non-corporation
employed
optometrist
or
non-members
of
the
state
board.
there
has
been
litigation
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
sir?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
alabama
state
optometrical
association
and
then
the
state
board
come
from
the
association.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
oh,
no,
excuse
me.
i
am
sorry.
i
meant
the
association.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
membership
of
the
board
is
five
members.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
litigation
first
begun
in
1956
in
the
case
of
alabama
state
board
v.
bush
jewelry,
they
attempted
to
entertain
some
license
revocation
action
with
optometrist
because
he
had
violated
the
association’s
code
of
ethics.
the
alabama
supreme
court
says
you
can’t
take
his
license
away
from
that
because
you
can’t
impose
your
association’s
code
of
ethics
on
a
non-member
of
the
association
when
he
is
actually
pursuing
the
right
given
to
him
by
statute.
later,
the
next
case
of
the
alabama
state
board
v.
dr.
mccrory
who
is
one
of
the
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case
was
begun
in
1961.
they
started
the
license
revocation
proceeding
against
mccrory
alleging
that
he
was
guilty
of
unprofessional
conduct
because
he
has
allowed
his
license
to
be
used
and
had
advertise
the
practice
of
his
profession.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
they
referred
to
themselves
as
doctor,
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
allow
them
to
do
it.
there
is
just
a
--
in
fact
the
alabama
supreme
court
--
the
last
case,
the
lee
case,
the
deciding
point
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
learned
profession
and
the
court
said
that
it
was
not.
that
it
was
a
limited
statutory
profession.
but
in
any
rate,
mccrory
who
was
one
of
the
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case
was
there
was
an
attempt
to
prosecution.
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
that
the
state
board
did
not
have
the
authority
to
prosecute
him
or
to
revoke
his
license.
that
occurred
in
1965.
the
basis
of
that
holding
was
a
provision
of
the
alabama
code
which
guaranteed
him
the
right
to
advertise
and
also
said
that
the
department
store
could
have
an
optometrical
department.
at
that
point,
the
advice
of
this
board,
the
present
member
of
this
board
begins
to
become
more
evident.
we
think
that
their
depositions
and
their
testimony
showed
it
very
clearly.
this
state
board
dr.
thomas
s.
gibson
who
was
chairman
of
the
alabama
state
board
of
optometry
was
also
legislative
chairman
of
the
alabama
state
optometric
association.
members
of
the
association
were
asked
to
contribute
or
assess,
we
do
not
know.
although,
some
dr.
gibson
himself
contributed
$500.00
and
so
did
other
members
of
the
state
board
to
what
they
referred
to
as
a
legislative
fund
to
secure
the
repeal
of
section
210
of
the
optometry
act.
this
was
a
section
which
gave
corporations
a
specific
right
to
employ
optometrists.
this
section
was
appealed
in
august,
i
believe,
of
1965.
then
in
october
of
1965,
dr.
thomas
s.
gibson
filed
a
sworn
complaint
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
in
behalf
of
the
state
board
of
optometry,
all
of
the
members
of
the
state
board
where
part
as
to
this
complaint.
they
alleged
that
all
of
these
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case
were
guilty
of
improper
and
unethical
practice,
and
that
they
where
employed
by
corporation
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
law
and
ask
that
the
court
enjoin
these
optometrists
from
working
for
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
from
employing
them.
later,
as
mr.
billups
said
that
the
court
let
the
individual
optometrist
out
of
the
case
on
technicality.
at
the
same
time,
the
civil
proceeding
was
filed.
the
alabama
state
optometric
association
initiated
charge
before
the
state
board.
so
at
this
point,
you
have
a
state
board
maintaining
a
civil
action,
claiming
that
these
people
are
guilty
of
something,
and
at
the
same
time,
they
are
fixing
the
trial
to
revoke
their
license
in
a
proceeding
both
by
their
apparent
organization
and
alabama
state
board
of
optometry.
their
license
revocation
charges
were
held
at
advance
over
a
period
of
six
or
seven
years.
during
this
time,
the
state
court
enjoined
lee
from
employing
optometrist
held
that
is
was
a
learned
profession
and
all
sorts
of
thing.
the
alabama
supreme
court
reversed
and
summarily
and
rendered
the
case
and
that
was
the
end
of
that.
it
said
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
them
employed
optometrist.
while
this
was
pending
in
just
a
few
weeks
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
rendered
its
opinion,
these
appellees
were
again
notified
that
license
revocation
charges
where
going
to
be
brought
and
that
they
were
going
to
be
prosecuted
for
practicing
optometry
illegally
because
they
were
working
for
a
corporation
--
corporate
practice.
at
this
point,
we
had
asked
the
board
to
recuse
itself,
it
had
refused
and
we
filed
this
action
invoke
in
the
provisions
of
1983
to
protect
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
their
allegations
were
in
the
evident
showed
that
there
had
been
between
the
state
board
of
optometry
and
this
alabama
optometric
association
are
common
defense
fund
whereby
they
have
shared
legal
expense
for
the
prosecution
of
these
people.
they
had
conferred
at
links
between
themselves
as
to
the
cause
of
the
litigation
action
be
handled
and
how
corporate
practice
should
be
eliminated.
there
had
been
as
i
said
contribution
to
legislative
fund
by
members
of
the
civil
suit.
the
board
chairman
himself
testified
in
his
deposition
that
the
state
board
of
optometry
felt
compelled
follow
the
mandates
and
dictates
of
the
alabama
optometric
society
and
determining
what
to
do
and
how
to
handle
these
things.
we
feel
that
basically,
the
case
presents
a
perfect
illustration
of
vast
prejudice
and
disqualification
upon
the
trial
of
fact
who
are
ultimately
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
these
optometrists
as
to
whether
they
should
be
able
to
practice
their
profession.
as
to
the
rights
of
supersedeas
and
irreparable
injury,
we
think
that
it
goes
without
saying
the
quote
from
what
--
one
of
the
district
judges
said
in
source
of
florida
case,
i
forgot
what
is
--
had
absolutely
nothing
to
lose,
except
their
livelihood
and
the
right
to
practice
that
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
district
court
considered
younger
versus
harris
and
said
that
they
recognized
the
doctrine
of
abstention,
but
said
that
in
cases
of
harassment
and
where
there
was
obvious
bias
and
disqualification
and
the
person
could
not
received
due
process
in
the
first
instance
that
federal
equity
jurisdiction
should
be
invoke
and
enjoin
this
board
from
prosecuting
these
appellees.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that’s
only
thing
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
i
am.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir
that
supports
me
and
that
is
exactly
the
position
that
we
feel
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
does.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
i
am
not
familiar
with
ward
case
your
honor,
but
it
is
my
understanding
from
this
court’s
previous
holdings
that
if
the
defendant
could
not
be
afforded
due
process
in
the
first
instance
and
that
was
sufficient
to
--
before
the
court.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
sir?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
dombrowski.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
it
was
to
enjoin
i
think
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
they
mentioned
the
fact
that
in
younger
that
it
was
not
made
clear
whether
or
not
they
would
apply
to
civil
proceedings.
but,
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that’s
all.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that’s
right.
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
the
only
real
finding
made
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
that
we
could
not
get
due
process,
and
that
there
was
bias
and
irreparable
injury
threat
that
the
injunction
should
issue.
and
that
the
decision
had
to
be
based
upon
the
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute
as
to
the
defendant
as
opposed
to
the
finding
of
constitution
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
have
gone
federal
court,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
oh,
i
guess,
as
i
see
moving
from
administrative
to
judicial
injunction.
you
mean
a
pending
state
action?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
are
you
asking
me,
do
i
think
that
we
have
could
have?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
we
could
have.
i
think
that
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
think
we
could
ask
for
as
i
understand
--
only
if
you
could
ask
for
anything,
i
guess.
but,
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
very
well
advised
to
start
for
a
lawyer
to
start
proceeding
in
one
court
and
then
decide
to
switch
horses
and
go
to
the
other.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
my
idea
and
my
theory
is
that
that
courts
have
concurrent
equity
jurisdiction
and
as
you
say
in
ex
parte
young
in
one
of
these
cases
where
you
have
a
federal
right
with
the
congress
has
said,
let’s
give
them
protection,
that
you
ought
to
give
them
protection,
the
only
thing
that
keeps
you
from
it
is
a
doctrine
of
abstention
or
just
considering
our
federalism
as
you
mentioned
in
the
younger
case.
and
if
the
facts
override,
that
measures
which
normally
would
indicate
to
you
to
restrain
something
and
go
as
you
go
follow,
that’s
our
theory.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no.
i
think
it
would
have
been
res
judicata.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
possibly
for
this
court,
i
think
if
we
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
do
not
believe
we
could,
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that’s
basically
on
the
reference,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
any
questions,
your
honor?
i
might
add
that
our
theory
in
--
was
irreparable
injury
as
far
as
the
damage
to
these
people,
that
is
the
basis
for
the
injunctive
relief
because
and
i
think
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
i
mean
our
theory
just
pure
and
simply
where
there
is
a
criminal
or
civil
proceeding
that
we
are
entitled
a
1983
protection
of
the
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
and
that
you
have
all
of
the
elements
to
support
equitable
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
to
protect
them.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that
holding
would
not
have
been
per
se
applicable
in
this
instance.
i
mean
to
these
defendants
in
this
case,
other
than
establishing
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
it
is
establishes
rules
of
law
that
says
that
these
appellees
are
not
guilty
of
what
they
have
been
charged
within
these
proceedings.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
it
took
us
two
years
to
get
that.
so,
i
mean
there
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
sir?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
we
did
not
start.
now,
that
was
another
prosecution
back
in
1956.
i
cited
those
cases
to
just
show
the
evidence
of
harassment
that
has
--
that
we
alleged
in
our
brief.
and
i
might
mention
one
other
thing.
i
think
that
the
trial
court
found
evidence
of
pecuniary
interest
in
the
same
by
board
members.
the
evidence
that
came
out
in
the
hearing
was
that
there
was
some
said
the
5,000
pairs
of
eyeglasses
sold
by
the
employer
of
the
appellees
alone
in
the
state
for
alabama
in
one
year,
besides
from
the
price
differential
chart
between
the
two
parties.
i
mean
that
the
employers
of
these
people
at
one
time
examined
eyes
free
and
sold
glasses
for
$20.00
a
pair.
the
members
of
the
state
association
and
the
board
members
at
the
same
time
were
charging
$20.00
to
examine
eyes
and
sold
all
of
the
glasses.
so,
if
you
take
it
right
down
to
the
dollar
marks
in
the
thing,
you
have
a
proposition
where
you
get
$30,000.00
per
year
per
man
as
far
as
the
sale
of
eyeglasses
and
this
is
what
the
whole
thing
is
about.
it’s
a
competitive
proposition
that
had
been
for
20
years.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
is
and
i
think
that
possibly
to
focus
upon
the
issues
which
duly
present
here.
i
might
make
this
statement
at
outset,
and
that
is
that
in
our
view
in
the
study
of
the
district
court’s
opinion,
the
three-judge
district
court
held
nothing
unconstitutional.
no
statute
was
held
unconstitutional.
the
only
effect
of
the
courts
decision
and
opinion
being
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
holding
that
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
point
of
my
saying
is,
your
honor,
that
i
think
we
are
going
to
get
back
to
a
regular
1983
case
and
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
district
court
should
have
exercise
equity
jurisdiction
to
enjoin?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
right,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
yes
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes
--
no,
sir.
no,
sir
before
an
administrative
board
to
revoke
the
appellees
licenses
to
practice.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir,
inadequate
as
we
contended
in
the
court
below.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
de
novo.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
in
our
opinion
the
judgment,
there
was
no
absolute
right
supersedeas.
alabama
case
hold
that
supersedeas
is
not
a
matter
of
right
and
unless
granted
by
statute
must
be
directed
to
one
of
the
circuit
judges
and
if
the
circuit
judge
has
authority
to
issue
a
writ
of
supersedeas
at
law
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
the
case
was
state
v.
keel
cited
by
the
appellant
involved
the
fact
situation
where
the
department
of
conservation
had
issued
some
regulation
prohibiting
trotline
fishing
in
the
river
in
alabama.
and
the
defendant
was
arrested
for
trotline
fishing
and
they
held
that
they
could
issue
a
warrant
on
this.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir,
but
the
facts
here
additionally,
we
contend
and
we
thank
the
record
as
replete
with
examples
of
vast
prejudice
and
disqualification
on
the
part
of
the
tribunal
who
where
--
who
what,
which
was
to
try
these
defendants,
and
that’s
the
basis
we
ask
for
the
injunction
in
the
first
place.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
administrative
supersedeas,
your
honor,
was
nothing
more
than
administrative
grace
in
this
instance.
there
had
been
no
right
to
supersedeas
after
this
action
was
filed.
after
the
board
members
had
refused
to
recuse
themselves
at
our
request,
we
filed
a
suit
and
asked
if
they
be
enjoined.
after
the
suit
was
filed
and
while
it
was
pending,
then
they
past
regulation
number
one
which
was
the
first
regulation
the
alabama
state
board
of
optometry
had
passed
in
some
40
years.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir
because
i
don’t
think
administrative
board
can
pass
a
statute
allowing
supersedeas.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir
but
the
regulation
could
be
revoked
as
easily
as
it
was
passed.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
your
honor,
they
said
they
would
and
after
this
suit
was
filed.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir
except
if
i
may
recite
the
history
of
this
litigation
and
the
background
which
we
claim
shows
the
disqualification
on
the
part
of
the
board.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
mandamus
was
available
on
the
state
side
to
require
that
board
members
to
recuse
themselves,
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
because
we
thought
we
had
concurrent
federal
jurisdiction
on
the
1983.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
i
will
just
mention
the
geiger
case
to
get
it
behind
this
right
now.
this
was
the
proceeding
to
revoke
the
license
of
a
doctor
in
the
state
of
georgia,
and
that
--
i
forgot
whether
it
was
this
court
or
the
district
court
refused
to
issue
an
injunction
because
there
was
no
allegation
that
he
would
be
denied
due
process
in
the
first
instance,
or
that
he
could
not
avail
himself
of
constitutional
defense,
and
the
defense
of
a
single
criminal
action.
in
this
case,
we
allege
that
they
could
not
get
due
process
in
the
first
instance,
and
that
we
have
been
subjected
to
harassment.
but
it
would
be
--
deprive
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
and
for
that
reason,
we
invoked
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
under
1983.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
your
honor,
the
denial
of
due
process
we
feel
would
be
number
one
and
either
making
us
go
before
board,
which
we
think
this
court
will
recognize
--
just
obviously
disqualified,
or
pursuing
a
mandamus
remedy.
in
the
state
court,
it
tried
to
require
them
to
recuse
themselves
and
also
having
some
question
about
supersedeas
during
which
time
these
people
are
deprived
of
the
right
to
practice
their
profession,
with
the
attempt
of
embarrassment
and
trouble
that
they
might
face
by
having
been
--
having
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
by
injunction
probably.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
and
i
might
add
the
state
court
which
too
which
we
would
have
to
apply
with
the
same
one
and
then
just
enjoin
the
same
optometrists
are
enjoined
lee
optical
from
employing
the
same
optometrist.
the
decision
are
in
which
was
later
reversed
and
rendered
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
if
the
state
courts
where
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
yes,
sir.
i
mean,
that
is
where
we
were.
we
were
in
the
same
position.
we
think
as
the
defendants
were
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
whether
or
not
we
could
have
defended
this
in
the
single
action,
of
course,
we
think
it
is
a
question
for
the
court.
if
i
may
review
the
history
and
what
the
record
was
shown,
the
record
is
voluminous
in
its
appeal
with
that.
the
appendix
has
some
400
or
500
pages
of
testimony
in
here
from
the
state
board
members,
that
position
were
taken
from
each
of
them.
the
history
of
this
litigation
goes
back
to
old
1956,
the
first
that
the
two
alabama
state
statutes
giving
the
board
the
authority
to
regulate
the
practice
of
optometry
are
sections
206
and
then
addition
there,
some
other
section.
one
of
the
sections
says
that
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
be
deemed
to
deny
the
right
of
a
department
store
or
some
other
business
to
operate
in
optometrical
department.
assuming
that
it’s
under
the
control
of
a
licensed
optometrist
and
that
his
name
appears
in
any
advertisement,
there
have
been
prosecution
of
several
or
one
or
two
at
least
optometrist,
under
this
act
holding
that
there
where
guilty
of
unprofessional
conduct
because
their
name
had
appeared
in
advertising.
the
board
prosecuted
these
people
because
they
said
that
they
violated
the
code
of
ethics
of
the
alabama
optometric
association.
the
alabama
optometric
association
has
given
the
authority
by
the
legislature
to
admit
members
to
practice
and
govern
the
practice
of
the
profession
within
alabama
in
code
--
state
code.
the
alabama
optometric
association
also
nominates
the
members
of
the
alabama
state
board
and
board
members
must
come
from
the
association.
also,
in
the
record
or
in
the
rules
of
the
alabama
optometric
association
is
a
provision
which
says
that
any
optometrist
who
is
employed
by
anybody
other
than
a
licensed
optometrist
cannot
join
the
association.
so
that
optometrist
who
are
employed
by
corporations
or
optical
dispensaries
are
excluded
from
membership
and
the
organization
govern
the
practice
of
their
profession.
now,
the
association
and
the
state
board
had
admittedly
these
stipulated
mr.
billups
stated
in
his
statement
had
been
engaged
for
many
years
and
had
been
interested
in
eliminating
what
they
refer
to
as
corporate
practice
of
optometry
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
other
states.
that
is
that
the
practice
by
which
an
optometrist
maybe
employed
by
an
optical
dispensary.
in
alabama,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
there
are
a
hundred
members
of
the
alabama
state
board
of
optometry.
there
are
92
members
of
these
non-corporation
employed
optometrist
or
non-members
of
the
state
board.
there
has
been
litigation
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
sir?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
alabama
state
optometrical
association
and
then
the
state
board
come
from
the
association.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
oh,
no,
excuse
me.
i
am
sorry.
i
meant
the
association.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
membership
of
the
board
is
five
members.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
litigation
first
begun
in
1956
in
the
case
of
alabama
state
board
v.
bush
jewelry,
they
attempted
to
entertain
some
license
revocation
action
with
optometrist
because
he
had
violated
the
association’s
code
of
ethics.
the
alabama
supreme
court
says
you
can’t
take
his
license
away
from
that
because
you
can’t
impose
your
association’s
code
of
ethics
on
a
non-member
of
the
association
when
he
is
actually
pursuing
the
right
given
to
him
by
statute.
later,
the
next
case
of
the
alabama
state
board
v.
dr.
mccrory
who
is
one
of
the
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case
was
begun
in
1961.
they
started
the
license
revocation
proceeding
against
mccrory
alleging
that
he
was
guilty
of
unprofessional
conduct
because
he
has
allowed
his
license
to
be
used
and
had
advertise
the
practice
of
his
profession.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
they
referred
to
themselves
as
doctor,
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
allow
them
to
do
it.
there
is
just
a
--
in
fact
the
alabama
supreme
court
--
the
last
case,
the
lee
case,
the
deciding
point
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
learned
profession
and
the
court
said
that
it
was
not.
that
it
was
a
limited
statutory
profession.
but
in
any
rate,
mccrory
who
was
one
of
the
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case
was
there
was
an
attempt
to
prosecution.
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
that
the
state
board
did
not
have
the
authority
to
prosecute
him
or
to
revoke
his
license.
that
occurred
in
1965.
the
basis
of
that
holding
was
a
provision
of
the
alabama
code
which
guaranteed
him
the
right
to
advertise
and
also
said
that
the
department
store
could
have
an
optometrical
department.
at
that
point,
the
advice
of
this
board,
the
present
member
of
this
board
begins
to
become
more
evident.
we
think
that
their
depositions
and
their
testimony
showed
it
very
clearly.
this
state
board
dr.
thomas
s.
gibson
who
was
chairman
of
the
alabama
state
board
of
optometry
was
also
legislative
chairman
of
the
alabama
state
optometric
association.
members
of
the
association
were
asked
to
contribute
or
assess,
we
do
not
know.
although,
some
dr.
gibson
himself
contributed
$500.00
and
so
did
other
members
of
the
state
board
to
what
they
referred
to
as
a
legislative
fund
to
secure
the
repeal
of
section
210
of
the
optometry
act.
this
was
a
section
which
gave
corporations
a
specific
right
to
employ
optometrists.
this
section
was
appealed
in
august,
i
believe,
of
1965.
then
in
october
of
1965,
dr.
thomas
s.
gibson
filed
a
sworn
complaint
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
in
behalf
of
the
state
board
of
optometry,
all
of
the
members
of
the
state
board
where
part
as
to
this
complaint.
they
alleged
that
all
of
these
plaintiff
appellees
in
this
case
were
guilty
of
improper
and
unethical
practice,
and
that
they
where
employed
by
corporation
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
law
and
ask
that
the
court
enjoin
these
optometrists
from
working
for
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
from
employing
them.
later,
as
mr.
billups
said
that
the
court
let
the
individual
optometrist
out
of
the
case
on
technicality.
at
the
same
time,
the
civil
proceeding
was
filed.
the
alabama
state
optometric
association
initiated
charge
before
the
state
board.
so
at
this
point,
you
have
a
state
board
maintaining
a
civil
action,
claiming
that
these
people
are
guilty
of
something,
and
at
the
same
time,
they
are
fixing
the
trial
to
revoke
their
license
in
a
proceeding
both
by
their
apparent
organization
and
alabama
state
board
of
optometry.
their
license
revocation
charges
were
held
at
advance
over
a
period
of
six
or
seven
years.
during
this
time,
the
state
court
enjoined
lee
from
employing
optometrist
held
that
is
was
a
learned
profession
and
all
sorts
of
thing.
the
alabama
supreme
court
reversed
and
summarily
and
rendered
the
case
and
that
was
the
end
of
that.
it
said
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
them
employed
optometrist.
while
this
was
pending
in
just
a
few
weeks
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
rendered
its
opinion,
these
appellees
were
again
notified
that
license
revocation
charges
where
going
to
be
brought
and
that
they
were
going
to
be
prosecuted
for
practicing
optometry
illegally
because
they
were
working
for
a
corporation
--
corporate
practice.
at
this
point,
we
had
asked
the
board
to
recuse
itself,
it
had
refused
and
we
filed
this
action
invoke
in
the
provisions
of
1983
to
protect
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
their
allegations
were
in
the
evident
showed
that
there
had
been
between
the
state
board
of
optometry
and
this
alabama
optometric
association
are
common
defense
fund
whereby
they
have
shared
legal
expense
for
the
prosecution
of
these
people.
they
had
conferred
at
links
between
themselves
as
to
the
cause
of
the
litigation
action
be
handled
and
how
corporate
practice
should
be
eliminated.
there
had
been
as
i
said
contribution
to
legislative
fund
by
members
of
the
civil
suit.
the
board
chairman
himself
testified
in
his
deposition
that
the
state
board
of
optometry
felt
compelled
follow
the
mandates
and
dictates
of
the
alabama
optometric
society
and
determining
what
to
do
and
how
to
handle
these
things.
we
feel
that
basically,
the
case
presents
a
perfect
illustration
of
vast
prejudice
and
disqualification
upon
the
trial
of
fact
who
are
ultimately
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
these
optometrists
as
to
whether
they
should
be
able
to
practice
their
profession.
as
to
the
rights
of
supersedeas
and
irreparable
injury,
we
think
that
it
goes
without
saying
the
quote
from
what
--
one
of
the
district
judges
said
in
source
of
florida
case,
i
forgot
what
is
--
had
absolutely
nothing
to
lose,
except
their
livelihood
and
the
right
to
practice
that
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
district
court
considered
younger
versus
harris
and
said
that
they
recognized
the
doctrine
of
abstention,
but
said
that
in
cases
of
harassment
and
where
there
was
obvious
bias
and
disqualification
and
the
person
could
not
received
due
process
in
the
first
instance
that
federal
equity
jurisdiction
should
be
invoke
and
enjoin
this
board
from
prosecuting
these
appellees.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that’s
only
thing
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
i
am.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir
that
supports
me
and
that
is
exactly
the
position
that
we
feel
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
does.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
i
am
not
familiar
with
ward
case
your
honor,
but
it
is
my
understanding
from
this
court’s
previous
holdings
that
if
the
defendant
could
not
be
afforded
due
process
in
the
first
instance
and
that
was
sufficient
to
--
before
the
court.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
sir?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
dombrowski.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
it
was
to
enjoin
i
think
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
they
mentioned
the
fact
that
in
younger
that
it
was
not
made
clear
whether
or
not
they
would
apply
to
civil
proceedings.
but,
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that’s
all.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that’s
right.
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
the
only
real
finding
made
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
that
we
could
not
get
due
process,
and
that
there
was
bias
and
irreparable
injury
threat
that
the
injunction
should
issue.
and
that
the
decision
had
to
be
based
upon
the
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute
as
to
the
defendant
as
opposed
to
the
finding
of
constitution
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
have
gone
federal
court,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
oh,
i
guess,
as
i
see
moving
from
administrative
to
judicial
injunction.
you
mean
a
pending
state
action?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
are
you
asking
me,
do
i
think
that
we
have
could
have?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
we
could
have.
i
think
that
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
think
we
could
ask
for
as
i
understand
--
only
if
you
could
ask
for
anything,
i
guess.
but,
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
very
well
advised
to
start
for
a
lawyer
to
start
proceeding
in
one
court
and
then
decide
to
switch
horses
and
go
to
the
other.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
my
idea
and
my
theory
is
that
that
courts
have
concurrent
equity
jurisdiction
and
as
you
say
in
ex
parte
young
in
one
of
these
cases
where
you
have
a
federal
right
with
the
congress
has
said,
let’s
give
them
protection,
that
you
ought
to
give
them
protection,
the
only
thing
that
keeps
you
from
it
is
a
doctrine
of
abstention
or
just
considering
our
federalism
as
you
mentioned
in
the
younger
case.
and
if
the
facts
override,
that
measures
which
normally
would
indicate
to
you
to
restrain
something
and
go
as
you
go
follow,
that’s
our
theory.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no.
i
think
it
would
have
been
res
judicata.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
possibly
for
this
court,
i
think
if
we
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
do
not
believe
we
could,
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that’s
basically
on
the
reference,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
any
questions,
your
honor?
i
might
add
that
our
theory
in
--
was
irreparable
injury
as
far
as
the
damage
to
these
people,
that
is
the
basis
for
the
injunctive
relief
because
and
i
think
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
i
mean
our
theory
just
pure
and
simply
where
there
is
a
criminal
or
civil
proceeding
that
we
are
entitled
a
1983
protection
of
the
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
and
that
you
have
all
of
the
elements
to
support
equitable
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
to
protect
them.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that
holding
would
not
have
been
per
se
applicable
in
this
instance.
i
mean
to
these
defendants
in
this
case,
other
than
establishing
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
it
is
establishes
rules
of
law
that
says
that
these
appellees
are
not
guilty
of
what
they
have
been
charged
within
these
proceedings.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
sir.
it
took
us
two
years
to
get
that.
so,
i
mean
there
--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
sir?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
we
did
not
start.
now,
that
was
another
prosecution
back
in
1956.
i
cited
those
cases
to
just
show
the
evidence
of
harassment
that
has
--
that
we
alleged
in
our
brief.
and
i
might
mention
one
other
thing.
i
think
that
the
trial
court
found
evidence
of
pecuniary
interest
in
the
same
by
board
members.
the
evidence
that
came
out
in
the
hearing
was
that
there
was
some
said
the
5,000
pairs
of
eyeglasses
sold
by
the
employer
of
the
appellees
alone
in
the
state
for
alabama
in
one
year,
besides
from
the
price
differential
chart
between
the
two
parties.
i
mean
that
the
employers
of
these
people
at
one
time
examined
eyes
free
and
sold
glasses
for
$20.00
a
pair.
the
members
of
the
state
association
and
the
board
members
at
the
same
time
were
charging
$20.00
to
examine
eyes
and
sold
all
of
the
glasses.
so,
if
you
take
it
right
down
to
the
dollar
marks
in
the
thing,
you
have
a
proposition
where
you
get
$30,000.00
per
year
per
man
as
far
as
the
sale
of
eyeglasses
and
this
is
what
the
whole
thing
is
about.
it’s
a
competitive
proposition
that
had
been
for
20
years.
