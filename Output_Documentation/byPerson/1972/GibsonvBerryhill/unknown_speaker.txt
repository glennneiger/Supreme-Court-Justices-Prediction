unknown
speaker
mr.
billups,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
that
the
mitchum
v.
foster
is
a
case
up
here
in
your
favor?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
its
authority
that
favors
your
side
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
state
in
your
brief
that
the
--
you
feel
that
mitchum
against
foster
as
here
decided
is
persuasive
in
the
case
at
bar
in
favor
of
the
appellants.
now,
i
wonder
if
you
really
feel
this
way.
could
i
ask
whether
you
rely
primarily
on
the
abstention
doctrine
of
younger
v.
harris
or
on
the
anti-injunction
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn’t
remember
that
you
cited
younger
v.
harris
and
i
was
curious.
you
cited
samuels
v.
mackell
in
the
accompanying
case.
unknown
speaker
but
the
proposition
of
the
--
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
fit
in
that
issue
and
injunction
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
not
cite
samuels
v.
mackell,
the
main
ingredient
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
so
what’s
the
point
if
you
are
saying
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
anti-injunction
statute
just
wouldn’t
apply
under
mitchum,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
and
so,
you
put
up
with
younger
against
harris
in
terms
of
this
matter?
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
a
pending
--
you
–
the
type
of
injunction
was
issued
you
have
a
pending
administrative
proceeding
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
i
said
that
it
has
been
a
pending
administrative
proceeding
in
the
state,
here
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
which
was
subject
to
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
that
review
would
be
in
de
novo
or
on
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
an
abstention
right
to
it
with
the
right
to
--
would
there
a
be
an
interim
or
right
to
an
injunction
against
your
accreditation?
unknown
speaker
well,
had
the
alabama
courts
categorize
this
standard
proceeding
as
a
penal
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
so
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
court
should
withhold
an
injunction
where
there
is
pending
a
state
--
that
administrative
proceeding
subjected
to
these
review.
unknown
speaker
have
they
had
something
up
like
harassment
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
what
about
the
administrative
supersedeas,
if
that’s
the
right
term?
unknown
speaker
oh,
well,
even
if
you
have
not
got
the
injunction,
you
did
get
from
the
three-judge
court,
would
that
adminis
--
that
regulation
have
been
operative?
unknown
speaker
permit
you
to
carry
on
--
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
well,
i
suppose
i
gather
the
statement
and
speculated.
some
regulation
said
that
they
would
not
bother
you
pending
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question
in
connection
with
procedure,
was
mandamus
on
the
state
side
available
to
you?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
pursue
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
reason
why
you
didn’t?
unknown
speaker
well
that
means
you
preferred
to
go
into
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
and
then
sometime
when
your
argument,
will
you
discuss
the
geiger
case
which
was
cited
by
your
opponent
and
not
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
the
state
association?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
state
board
or
state
association?
unknown
speaker
i
misunderstood
you.
you
did
not
say
the
membership
of
the
board
was
100?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
should
the
district
court
to
say
or
do
about
younger
against
harris
are
same
as
--
unknown
speaker
so,
i
gather
then
the
district
court
equated
the
bias.
unknown
speaker
that
he
found
--
you
had
--
unknown
speaker
he
found
that
that
way
was
to
be
equated
with
her
aspect?
unknown
speaker
the
point
is
mr.
cole,
are
you
familiar
with
our
recent
decision
last
november
in
ward
versus
monroeville?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
a
case
that
involved
allegations
of
bias
by
local
magistrate,
in
which
it
was
contended
that
--
it
was
no
constitutional
deprivation
since
there
was
a
trial
de
novo
when
ohio
court
of
county
please.
and
we
have
in
that
case
that
--
or
in
any
event
may
the
states
trial
court
procedure
within
constitutionally
acceptable
simply
because
the
state
eventually
offers
defendant
an
impartial
adjudication.
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
neutral
and
detached
judge
in
the
first
instance.
i
suppose
that
supports
you?
unknown
speaker
or
that
goes
to
your
underlying
constitutional
claim?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
go
really
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
district
court
had
--
should
have
enjoined
the
state
proceedings,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
--
if
you
are
right
on
the
constitutional
claim,
you
can
make
that
claim
in
the
state
proceedings
as
it
was
done
in
ward
against
monroeville.
as
i
remember
that
came
right
up
here
directly
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
unknown
speaker
and
what
holdings
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
what
--
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there
was
no
pending
proceeding
in
dombrowski,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
pending
proceeding,
let
us
make
clear
in
dombrowski.
did
the
district
court
in
the
present
case
rest
any
part
of
its
willingness
to
go
ahead
and
enjoin
the
state
proceedings
on
the
ground
that
they
where
not
criminal
proceedings,
but
rather
were
civil
administrative
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
that’s
all
--
unknown
speaker
--
they
went
no
further
--
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
that
the
administrative
proceeding
had
been
completed
and
there
had
been
an
adverse
decision
to
your
clients,
and
you
had
appealed.
unknown
speaker
you
had
started
the
judicial
proceeding
in
the
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
and
then,
you
went
to
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
go
file
a
complaint,
and
ask
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
a
pending
state
action,
and
then,
you
go
to
the
federal
court
and
you
are
tired
of
the
state
proceedings.
you
think
you
can
get
better
justice
in
the
federal
court.
so,
you
go
to
the
federal
court
and
ask
for
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
administrative
judgment.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
in
holding
aside
from
younger
or
--
unknown
speaker
certainly,
what
younger
--
certainly
what
younger
perceives
to
litigate?
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
not
saved
your
federal
constitutional
claims
for
a
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
for
this
court
but
not
for
independent
action.
unknown
speaker
tell
me
mr.
cole,
is
there
an
expressed
finding
equating
this
bias
of
the
board
with
harassment
in
judge
brown’s
opinion
because
as
i
come
to
it.
it’s
at
(a)
(5)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
on
the
other
hand,
federal
courts
who
enjoin
state
proceedings
even
in
criminal
cases
protect
federal
rights
where
irreparable
injury
is
threatened
or
prevent
continue
the
harassment,
that’s
in
(a)
(5)
and
then
follows
recital,
i
gather
of
fact-findings.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(a)
5
and
6?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
gather
that
your
ideas,
even
if
younger
is
to
be
applicable
to
pending
civil
or
pending
administrative
state
proceedings,
this
comes
within
the
exception
anyway
for
harassment.
