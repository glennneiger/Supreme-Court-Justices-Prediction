mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
honorable
court.
this
is
a
case
where
charges
were
pending
against
the
plaintiff
optometrists,
charging
them
with
having
violated
certain
sections
of
the
optometry
law.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
this
is
a
case
where
charges
were
pending
against
the
plaintiff
optometrists
for
having
before
the
alabama
state
board
of
optometry,
after
having
scheduled
them
for
a
hearing
before
this
board
of
optometry
and
before
the
hearing,
this
suit
was
filed
to
enjoin
the
board
from
hearing
the
charges
and
the
board
voluntarily
agreed
to
withhold
further
action
until
this
case
has
been
finally
disposed
off.
the
plaintiffs
in
their
complaint
allege
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
of
the
optometrists
under
section
1983
of
the
federal
civil
rights
act
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
board
members
and
later
filed
a
second
cause
of
action
alleging
that
sections
192
and
206
of
the
alabama
optometry
law
were
unconstitutional
and
requested
a
hearing
before
a
three-judged
court
which
was
granted.
the
defendants
assert
that
there
was
no
misconduct
on
their
part
and
so
answered
and
also
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
case.
the
issues
were
joined
on
a
stipulation
of
facts
and
briefs
presented
to
court
which
granted
an
injunction
against
the
state
board,
its
members
and
successors
in
office
from
hearing
the
charges
and
in
addition,
held
section
192
and
206
unconstitutional
on
the
theory
that
said
section
192,
that
a
board
member
must
be
eligible
for
appointment,
had
to
be
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
alabama
optometric
association.
and
that
section
206
of
the
optometry
law
while
providing
the
procedure
for
handling
and
hearing
any
charges
filed
before
it
was
unconstitutional
because
even
though
it
provided
for
an
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision,
it
failed
to
spell
out
supersedeas
pending
on
appeal.
the
defendants
answered
that
these
two
sections
of
the
optometry
law
had
been
held
to
be
constitutional
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
a
prior
case
of
mccoy
versus
wood
and
was
not
violative
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
holding
of
the
court,
of
the
trial
court,
if
sustained,
will
destroy
virtually
every
state
created
licensing
board.
because
in
most
instances,
they
have
the
same
general
provision
such
as
section
192
that
board
members
must
be
members
of
the
association
to
be
eligible
for
appointment,
and
206
of
the
alabama
law
which
provides
for
the
handling
of
charges
and
in
the
alabama
law
206,
it
provides
that
from
an
adverse
ruling,
the
optometrist
can
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
his
home
county.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
now,
it
does
not
going
to
say
how
the
supersedeas
can
be
obtained,
but
in
alabama,
the
courts
have
held
that
any
court,
including
the
supreme
court
can
grant
supersedeas
and
so
this
holding
of
the
trial
court
would
as
to
say
where
it
limits
the
--
those
who
can
serve
on
the
board
to
members
of
the
association
or
as
in
some
states
where
they
are
recommended
by
the
association
to
the
governor
for
appointment,
if
permitted
to
stand
would
virtually
destroy
every
regulatory
licensing
board
created
by
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
in
alabama,
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
it’s
on
the
record
or
de
novo.
the
only
appeal
with
which
i’m
familiar
was
one
de
novo.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
this
has
--
it
will
be
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
residence
of
the
defendant
or
of
the
accused.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
there’s
no
limit
and
the
law
itself
as
i
read
it
and
as
i
remember
it.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
that’s
--
that
would
be
a
good
question,
but
there’s
nothing
in
the
optometry
law
that
so
holds
or
touches
on
that
topic.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well,
that
is
true
sir
except
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
unless
it’s
appealed,
unless
it's
appealed.
now,
but
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
and
i
will
get
the
--
and
in
order
to
cover
that
point
that
you
have
just
raised,
the
state
board
adapted
a
regulation
stating
that
any
event
of
an
adverse
decision,
the
state
board
would
take
no
action
or
hold
the
matter
in
abeyance
until
the
appeal
had
been
completed
and
determined.
so,
that
then
would
not
even
require
a
supersedeas
because
the
regulation
of
course
has
the
effect
of
law.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
no
sir.
there
was
no
time
limit
in
the
regulation.
now,
these
charges
grow
out
of
a
series
of
events
that
have
transpired
over
a
number
of
years
and
while
these
dates
are
set
out
in
the
various
pleadings,
i
believe
it
would
be
helpful
for
this
honorable
court
to
know
the
sequence
because
among
other
things,
the
board
is
charged
with
harassment
of
the
defendant
optometrist
because
of
the
fact
that
these
charges
laid
dormant
for
a
long
number
of
years.
but
for
many
years
and
then
from
the
adoption
of
the
optometry
law
in
1990,
section
210
of
the
optometry
law
permitted
a
retailer
or
a
store
to
maintain
an
optometric
department
wherein
eyes
were
examined
and
glassed
fitted,
provided
there
was
an
optometrist
in
charge
of
it.
that’s
what's
sometimes
referred
to
as
corporate
practice.
now,
on
august
4th,
1965,
section
210
was
repealed
in
its
entirety,
which
we
contend,
lets
it
fall
back
on
the
general
rule
that’s
well
recognized
that
in
the
absence
of
statutory
authority,
a
person
cannot
practice
a
profession
through
--
a
corporation
cannot
practice
a
profession
through
the
employment
of
a
licensed
professional.
and
we’ve
had
optometrists
and
physicians
involved
in
these
cases.
in
august
of
1965,
shortly
after
this
repeal,
the
state
board
notified
all
optometrists
to
comply
and
offer
their
assistance.
then,
on
october
26,
1965,
charges
filed
by
the
alabama
association
with
the
board
were
filed
which
included
charges
against
these
plaintiffs
below
who
were
employed
at
that
time
by
lee
optical
company.
a
short
time
later,
the
state
board
filed
an
injunction
suit
against
lee
optical
company
and
the
employed
optometrists,
including
one
physician,
alleging
that
the
optometrists
were
aiding
and
abating
lee
optical
in
the
unlawful
practice
of
optometry
and
by
so
doing,
they
themselves
were
unlawfully
practicing
optometry.
unfortunately,
there
was
no
precedent
in
alabama
for
the
filing
of
such
an
injunction
suit
in
any
of
the
professional
fields
perhaps
because
of
the
fact
that
the
section
210
which
permitted
corporations
to
function
as
they
did
discouraged
others
in
filing
any
suits
in
any
other
field.
now,
then
the
defendants,
all
of
them
filed
a
motion
to
abate
and
this
motion
was
sustained
because
as
i
say,
there
was
no
precedent
for
the
filing
of
such
an
injunction
suit.
now,
in
other
states,
there
is
a
statutory
authority
for
filing
of
such
suits.
then
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
to
abate
and
the
court
sustained
that
motion
to
abate
and
an
appeal
was
taken.
now,
then,
in
september
of
1967,
the
alabama
legislature
passed
act
number
509,
giving
all
boards
the
right
to
bring
an
injunction
suit
against
anyone
unlawfully
practicing
in
their
field
and
made
it
retroactive.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
thank
you
sir
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
last
question
being
discussed
with
one
of
supersedeas
when
the
time
run
out
and
not
continuing
to
believe
with
the
point
but
on
the
other
hand
in
the
three-judge
tribunal
or
three-judge
trial
court
under
said
paragraph
2
and
3,
it
states
supersedeases
within
the
power
of
the
court
without
statutory
authority
therefore
and
appeal
from
a
judgment
where
--
when
no
statute
requires
supersedeas
bond
to
affect
a
suspension.
it
ordinarily
suspends
the
judgment
without
such
a
bond.
in
addition
it
will
be
doubly
sure
because
it
was
prior
to
that
time
of
that
decision,
the
board
adopted
regulation
number
one
in
which
they
said
that
no
action
would
be
taken
pending
an
appeal.
now,
i
was
trying
to
show
an
answer
to
the
question
of
harassment
that
the
six
years
between
the
time
these
charges
and
suits
where
filed
resulted
from
no
action
on
the
part
of
the
board.
but
it
involved
one
case
that
went
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
question
of
the
sustaining
of
the
motion
to
abate
by
lower
court
in
the
injunction
case
against
lee.
and
the
supreme
court
held
that
--
and
overruled
the
lower
courts
in
their
holding
on
the
motion
to
abate
and
directed
the
court
to
proceed,
and
it
did
proceed
and
proceed
to
trial
with
a
judgment
and
an
injunction
granted
against
lee
optical
from
which
they
appeal
in
the
house
of
$8.50
case,
a
companion
case
and
that
it
involve
the
same
questions.
however
in
that
case,
the
optometrist
remained
in
the
case
along
with
the
house
of
$8.50
eyeglasses
when
in
the
lee
case,
a
motion
to
abate
on
their
part
of
the
optometrist
was
sustained
by
the
court
without
assigning
reasons
therefore
and
the
case
proceeded
to
trial
on
the
case
against
lee.
then
after
these
two
--
and
in
the
house
of
$8.50,
an
injunction
was
granted
against
both
the
house
of
$8.50
eyeglasses
and
their
employed
optometrist
from
enjoining
them
from
the
unlawful
practice
of
optometry.
following
that,
then,
these
charges
which
had
been
voluntarily
held
in
abeyance
by
the
court,
this
covered
appeared
of
almost
six
years,
and
with
the
counsel
for
the
board
stating
to
counsel
for
the
defendants
that
they
had
no
desire
of
whatsoever
to
run
the
optometrist
involve
out
of
alabama
that
they
where
badly
needed
in
alabama.
so
badly
is
the
shortage
of
optometrist
in
alabama
that
alabama
has
now
established
a
school
of
optometry
and
legislature
made
it
the
part
of
the
medical
complex
at
birmingham,
and
73,
they
will
graduate
their
first
class
of
optometrist.
so,
that
then
brings
us
up
to
the
injunction
suit
filed
in
federal
court
which
was
filed
between
the
time
of
the
decisions,
favorable
decisions
in
the
lower
court
granting
injunctions
which
were
appealed
by
lee
and
house
of
$8.50.
but
following
those
favorable
decisions,
then
these
charges
where
set
for
hearing
before
the
board
with
due
notice.
at
one
prior
time,
they
where
agreed
--
continued
by
agreement
as
shown
by
an
exhibit
in
the
record
because
of
the
possibility
that
by
participating
in
the
trial
by
the
state
board
it
might
cause
them
to
become
disqualified
to
hear
the
charges
as
a
state
board,
and
it
was
agreed
by
counsel
and
reduced
to
writing
and
is
in
the
record
that
that
would
not
be
true.
however,
no
one
--
no
member
of
the
state
board
did
participate
in
the
charges,
except
dr.
koch
who
is
at
that
time
president
and
soon
went
off
of
the
board
after
that
and
would
not
have
been
a
member
of
the
board
to
hear
these
charges
when
this
injunction
suit
was
filed
in
federal
court.
now,
we
have
the
geiger
case
from
georgia
which
is
almost
an
identical
case
to
the
case
we
have
here,
involving
charges
filed
against
a
physician
before
the
board,
alleging
misconduct
on
his
part.
and
in
that
case,
an
injunction
suit
was
filed
just
as
in
this
in
the
case
and
was
heard.
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
the
charges
where
penal
in
nature
and
the
anti-injunction
statute
would
apply
and
the
case
was
dismissed.
it
came
up
to
this
court
and
on
march
29,
1971,
the
action
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
now,
the
--
in
mccrory
v.
wood
in
mississippi,
it
has
been
held
that
these
sections
of
this
optometry
law
involved
here
are
constitutional,
even
though
held
unconstitutional
by
the
trial
court
in
the
federal
injunction
suit.
now
also
in
alabama
in
the
case
of
state
v.
keel,
it
has
been
held
that
such
charges
pending
before
a
state
board
are
penal
in
nature
and
by
virtue
of
being
penal
in
nature,
then
would
be
subject
to
the
anti-injunction
statute.
now,
then
that
brings
us
up
into
the
case
of
mitchum
from
florida
which
did
not
involve
a
professional
case,
but
involved
a
bookstore
and
an
injunction
was
filed
and
in
that
case,
the
--
charges
were
filed
in
state
court
against
the
bookstore
under
the
obscenity
law
before
they
were
tried,
before
they
were
heard,
then
an
injunction
suit
was
filed
in
federal
court
as
in
this
case.
then
upon
a
hearing,
the
three-judge
trial
court
held
that
since
this
was
a
penal
case
pending
a
state
court
that
the
anti-injunction
suit
section
2283
would
apply
and
the
case
was
dismissed.
then
upon
appeal
here,
this
honorable
court
held
that
the
exception
under
1983
or
that
there
was
an
exception
to
with
1983
to
such
a
penal
case
as
that.
and
based
on
that,
this
honorable
court
held
that
that
exception
applied
to
the
case
pending
in
florida,
and
reversed
the
lower
court
and
its
ruling
that
had
dismissed
saying
that
the
anti-injunction
suit
was
absolute
in
its
application.
this
honorable
court
reversed
but
at
the
same
time
in
a
concurrence,
it
was
suggested
that
perhaps
the
lower
court
should
give
consideration
to
what
could
be
accomplished
in
the
state
court,
in
the
disposition
of
this
matter.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
under
both
sir.
the
first
cause
of
action
was
under
the
civil
rights
section.
they
filed
a
second
cause
of
action
bringing
it
under
the
anti-injunction
suit.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well
sir,
as
i
read
the
three-judge
trial
court,
they
held
that
it
was
an
absolute
bar
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
sir?
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
where
mentioning
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
oh,
oh,
right,
right.
but,
it
--
they
issued
in
injunction
nevertheless
in
this
case,
the
present
case
in
joining
the
state
that
the
board
from
proceeding
with
a
hearing
on
the
charges.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
right.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
right,
right,
right.
now,
i
would
like
in
closing
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
mccrory
v.
wood
in
mississippi,
as
well
as
in
some
other
states,
sections
for
the
optometry
law
such
as
192
and
206
that
are
involved
here
are
constitutional,
and
for
what
that
might
be
worth
and
the
consideration
given
this
case
by
this
honorable
court
that
that
is
the
situation.
we
sincerely
trust
that
this
honorable
court
will
take
cognizance
of
the
extreme
importance
on
all
licensing
boards
of
the
decision
rendered
in
this
case
because
throughout
the
country,
practically
all
licensing
boards
in
the
professional
healthcare
field
have
similar
provisions
as
to
appointment
of
members
of
the
board
and
similar
provisions
as
to
membership
in
the
association,
and
in
general
appeals
from
charges
that
are
heard
before
the
board.
so,
i
thank
you
and
i
appreciate
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well,
it
came
up
here.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well,
the
mitchum
case
--
i
know
the
bay
springs
case
or
the
florida
case
was
in
our
favor
when
it
came
up
here.
and
yes
sir,
and
the
mitchum
case
was
in
our
favor
when
it
came
up
here.
but
when
it
went
back,
this
court
held
that
the
exception
of
the
civil
rights
act,
the
general
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
suit
applied,
and
they
reversed
the
dismissal
that
the
--
that
thereto
for
have
been
made,
if
i
am
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well
sir,
there
had
been
so
many
things
happened
to
this
lawsuit
and
so
many
decisions
rendered
between
now
and
then
in
all
younger
being
the
first
one
that
i
would
just
hesitate
to
say
sir,
except
that
i
--
we
treated
with
it
in
our
brief
as
sincerely
as
we
possibly
could
of
the
cases
that
where
decided
up
until
that
time.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
and
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
right.
but
in
our
briefs
of
making
up
to
pleadings,
we
did
cite
younger,
which
had
just
come
out.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
honorable
court.
this
is
a
case
where
charges
were
pending
against
the
plaintiff
optometrists,
charging
them
with
having
violated
certain
sections
of
the
optometry
law.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
this
is
a
case
where
charges
were
pending
against
the
plaintiff
optometrists
for
having
before
the
alabama
state
board
of
optometry,
after
having
scheduled
them
for
a
hearing
before
this
board
of
optometry
and
before
the
hearing,
this
suit
was
filed
to
enjoin
the
board
from
hearing
the
charges
and
the
board
voluntarily
agreed
to
withhold
further
action
until
this
case
has
been
finally
disposed
off.
the
plaintiffs
in
their
complaint
allege
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
of
the
optometrists
under
section
1983
of
the
federal
civil
rights
act
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
board
members
and
later
filed
a
second
cause
of
action
alleging
that
sections
192
and
206
of
the
alabama
optometry
law
were
unconstitutional
and
requested
a
hearing
before
a
three-judged
court
which
was
granted.
the
defendants
assert
that
there
was
no
misconduct
on
their
part
and
so
answered
and
also
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
case.
the
issues
were
joined
on
a
stipulation
of
facts
and
briefs
presented
to
court
which
granted
an
injunction
against
the
state
board,
its
members
and
successors
in
office
from
hearing
the
charges
and
in
addition,
held
section
192
and
206
unconstitutional
on
the
theory
that
said
section
192,
that
a
board
member
must
be
eligible
for
appointment,
had
to
be
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
alabama
optometric
association.
and
that
section
206
of
the
optometry
law
while
providing
the
procedure
for
handling
and
hearing
any
charges
filed
before
it
was
unconstitutional
because
even
though
it
provided
for
an
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision,
it
failed
to
spell
out
supersedeas
pending
on
appeal.
the
defendants
answered
that
these
two
sections
of
the
optometry
law
had
been
held
to
be
constitutional
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
a
prior
case
of
mccoy
versus
wood
and
was
not
violative
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
holding
of
the
court,
of
the
trial
court,
if
sustained,
will
destroy
virtually
every
state
created
licensing
board.
because
in
most
instances,
they
have
the
same
general
provision
such
as
section
192
that
board
members
must
be
members
of
the
association
to
be
eligible
for
appointment,
and
206
of
the
alabama
law
which
provides
for
the
handling
of
charges
and
in
the
alabama
law
206,
it
provides
that
from
an
adverse
ruling,
the
optometrist
can
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
his
home
county.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
now,
it
does
not
going
to
say
how
the
supersedeas
can
be
obtained,
but
in
alabama,
the
courts
have
held
that
any
court,
including
the
supreme
court
can
grant
supersedeas
and
so
this
holding
of
the
trial
court
would
as
to
say
where
it
limits
the
--
those
who
can
serve
on
the
board
to
members
of
the
association
or
as
in
some
states
where
they
are
recommended
by
the
association
to
the
governor
for
appointment,
if
permitted
to
stand
would
virtually
destroy
every
regulatory
licensing
board
created
by
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
in
alabama,
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
it’s
on
the
record
or
de
novo.
the
only
appeal
with
which
i’m
familiar
was
one
de
novo.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
this
has
--
it
will
be
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
residence
of
the
defendant
or
of
the
accused.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
there’s
no
limit
and
the
law
itself
as
i
read
it
and
as
i
remember
it.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
that’s
--
that
would
be
a
good
question,
but
there’s
nothing
in
the
optometry
law
that
so
holds
or
touches
on
that
topic.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well,
that
is
true
sir
except
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
unless
it’s
appealed,
unless
it's
appealed.
now,
but
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
and
i
will
get
the
--
and
in
order
to
cover
that
point
that
you
have
just
raised,
the
state
board
adapted
a
regulation
stating
that
any
event
of
an
adverse
decision,
the
state
board
would
take
no
action
or
hold
the
matter
in
abeyance
until
the
appeal
had
been
completed
and
determined.
so,
that
then
would
not
even
require
a
supersedeas
because
the
regulation
of
course
has
the
effect
of
law.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
no
sir.
there
was
no
time
limit
in
the
regulation.
now,
these
charges
grow
out
of
a
series
of
events
that
have
transpired
over
a
number
of
years
and
while
these
dates
are
set
out
in
the
various
pleadings,
i
believe
it
would
be
helpful
for
this
honorable
court
to
know
the
sequence
because
among
other
things,
the
board
is
charged
with
harassment
of
the
defendant
optometrist
because
of
the
fact
that
these
charges
laid
dormant
for
a
long
number
of
years.
but
for
many
years
and
then
from
the
adoption
of
the
optometry
law
in
1990,
section
210
of
the
optometry
law
permitted
a
retailer
or
a
store
to
maintain
an
optometric
department
wherein
eyes
were
examined
and
glassed
fitted,
provided
there
was
an
optometrist
in
charge
of
it.
that’s
what's
sometimes
referred
to
as
corporate
practice.
now,
on
august
4th,
1965,
section
210
was
repealed
in
its
entirety,
which
we
contend,
lets
it
fall
back
on
the
general
rule
that’s
well
recognized
that
in
the
absence
of
statutory
authority,
a
person
cannot
practice
a
profession
through
--
a
corporation
cannot
practice
a
profession
through
the
employment
of
a
licensed
professional.
and
we’ve
had
optometrists
and
physicians
involved
in
these
cases.
in
august
of
1965,
shortly
after
this
repeal,
the
state
board
notified
all
optometrists
to
comply
and
offer
their
assistance.
then,
on
october
26,
1965,
charges
filed
by
the
alabama
association
with
the
board
were
filed
which
included
charges
against
these
plaintiffs
below
who
were
employed
at
that
time
by
lee
optical
company.
a
short
time
later,
the
state
board
filed
an
injunction
suit
against
lee
optical
company
and
the
employed
optometrists,
including
one
physician,
alleging
that
the
optometrists
were
aiding
and
abating
lee
optical
in
the
unlawful
practice
of
optometry
and
by
so
doing,
they
themselves
were
unlawfully
practicing
optometry.
unfortunately,
there
was
no
precedent
in
alabama
for
the
filing
of
such
an
injunction
suit
in
any
of
the
professional
fields
perhaps
because
of
the
fact
that
the
section
210
which
permitted
corporations
to
function
as
they
did
discouraged
others
in
filing
any
suits
in
any
other
field.
now,
then
the
defendants,
all
of
them
filed
a
motion
to
abate
and
this
motion
was
sustained
because
as
i
say,
there
was
no
precedent
for
the
filing
of
such
an
injunction
suit.
now,
in
other
states,
there
is
a
statutory
authority
for
filing
of
such
suits.
then
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
to
abate
and
the
court
sustained
that
motion
to
abate
and
an
appeal
was
taken.
now,
then,
in
september
of
1967,
the
alabama
legislature
passed
act
number
509,
giving
all
boards
the
right
to
bring
an
injunction
suit
against
anyone
unlawfully
practicing
in
their
field
and
made
it
retroactive.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
thank
you
sir
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
last
question
being
discussed
with
one
of
supersedeas
when
the
time
run
out
and
not
continuing
to
believe
with
the
point
but
on
the
other
hand
in
the
three-judge
tribunal
or
three-judge
trial
court
under
said
paragraph
2
and
3,
it
states
supersedeases
within
the
power
of
the
court
without
statutory
authority
therefore
and
appeal
from
a
judgment
where
--
when
no
statute
requires
supersedeas
bond
to
affect
a
suspension.
it
ordinarily
suspends
the
judgment
without
such
a
bond.
in
addition
it
will
be
doubly
sure
because
it
was
prior
to
that
time
of
that
decision,
the
board
adopted
regulation
number
one
in
which
they
said
that
no
action
would
be
taken
pending
an
appeal.
now,
i
was
trying
to
show
an
answer
to
the
question
of
harassment
that
the
six
years
between
the
time
these
charges
and
suits
where
filed
resulted
from
no
action
on
the
part
of
the
board.
but
it
involved
one
case
that
went
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
question
of
the
sustaining
of
the
motion
to
abate
by
lower
court
in
the
injunction
case
against
lee.
and
the
supreme
court
held
that
--
and
overruled
the
lower
courts
in
their
holding
on
the
motion
to
abate
and
directed
the
court
to
proceed,
and
it
did
proceed
and
proceed
to
trial
with
a
judgment
and
an
injunction
granted
against
lee
optical
from
which
they
appeal
in
the
house
of
$8.50
case,
a
companion
case
and
that
it
involve
the
same
questions.
however
in
that
case,
the
optometrist
remained
in
the
case
along
with
the
house
of
$8.50
eyeglasses
when
in
the
lee
case,
a
motion
to
abate
on
their
part
of
the
optometrist
was
sustained
by
the
court
without
assigning
reasons
therefore
and
the
case
proceeded
to
trial
on
the
case
against
lee.
then
after
these
two
--
and
in
the
house
of
$8.50,
an
injunction
was
granted
against
both
the
house
of
$8.50
eyeglasses
and
their
employed
optometrist
from
enjoining
them
from
the
unlawful
practice
of
optometry.
following
that,
then,
these
charges
which
had
been
voluntarily
held
in
abeyance
by
the
court,
this
covered
appeared
of
almost
six
years,
and
with
the
counsel
for
the
board
stating
to
counsel
for
the
defendants
that
they
had
no
desire
of
whatsoever
to
run
the
optometrist
involve
out
of
alabama
that
they
where
badly
needed
in
alabama.
so
badly
is
the
shortage
of
optometrist
in
alabama
that
alabama
has
now
established
a
school
of
optometry
and
legislature
made
it
the
part
of
the
medical
complex
at
birmingham,
and
73,
they
will
graduate
their
first
class
of
optometrist.
so,
that
then
brings
us
up
to
the
injunction
suit
filed
in
federal
court
which
was
filed
between
the
time
of
the
decisions,
favorable
decisions
in
the
lower
court
granting
injunctions
which
were
appealed
by
lee
and
house
of
$8.50.
but
following
those
favorable
decisions,
then
these
charges
where
set
for
hearing
before
the
board
with
due
notice.
at
one
prior
time,
they
where
agreed
--
continued
by
agreement
as
shown
by
an
exhibit
in
the
record
because
of
the
possibility
that
by
participating
in
the
trial
by
the
state
board
it
might
cause
them
to
become
disqualified
to
hear
the
charges
as
a
state
board,
and
it
was
agreed
by
counsel
and
reduced
to
writing
and
is
in
the
record
that
that
would
not
be
true.
however,
no
one
--
no
member
of
the
state
board
did
participate
in
the
charges,
except
dr.
koch
who
is
at
that
time
president
and
soon
went
off
of
the
board
after
that
and
would
not
have
been
a
member
of
the
board
to
hear
these
charges
when
this
injunction
suit
was
filed
in
federal
court.
now,
we
have
the
geiger
case
from
georgia
which
is
almost
an
identical
case
to
the
case
we
have
here,
involving
charges
filed
against
a
physician
before
the
board,
alleging
misconduct
on
his
part.
and
in
that
case,
an
injunction
suit
was
filed
just
as
in
this
in
the
case
and
was
heard.
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
the
charges
where
penal
in
nature
and
the
anti-injunction
statute
would
apply
and
the
case
was
dismissed.
it
came
up
to
this
court
and
on
march
29,
1971,
the
action
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
now,
the
--
in
mccrory
v.
wood
in
mississippi,
it
has
been
held
that
these
sections
of
this
optometry
law
involved
here
are
constitutional,
even
though
held
unconstitutional
by
the
trial
court
in
the
federal
injunction
suit.
now
also
in
alabama
in
the
case
of
state
v.
keel,
it
has
been
held
that
such
charges
pending
before
a
state
board
are
penal
in
nature
and
by
virtue
of
being
penal
in
nature,
then
would
be
subject
to
the
anti-injunction
statute.
now,
then
that
brings
us
up
into
the
case
of
mitchum
from
florida
which
did
not
involve
a
professional
case,
but
involved
a
bookstore
and
an
injunction
was
filed
and
in
that
case,
the
--
charges
were
filed
in
state
court
against
the
bookstore
under
the
obscenity
law
before
they
were
tried,
before
they
were
heard,
then
an
injunction
suit
was
filed
in
federal
court
as
in
this
case.
then
upon
a
hearing,
the
three-judge
trial
court
held
that
since
this
was
a
penal
case
pending
a
state
court
that
the
anti-injunction
suit
section
2283
would
apply
and
the
case
was
dismissed.
then
upon
appeal
here,
this
honorable
court
held
that
the
exception
under
1983
or
that
there
was
an
exception
to
with
1983
to
such
a
penal
case
as
that.
and
based
on
that,
this
honorable
court
held
that
that
exception
applied
to
the
case
pending
in
florida,
and
reversed
the
lower
court
and
its
ruling
that
had
dismissed
saying
that
the
anti-injunction
suit
was
absolute
in
its
application.
this
honorable
court
reversed
but
at
the
same
time
in
a
concurrence,
it
was
suggested
that
perhaps
the
lower
court
should
give
consideration
to
what
could
be
accomplished
in
the
state
court,
in
the
disposition
of
this
matter.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
under
both
sir.
the
first
cause
of
action
was
under
the
civil
rights
section.
they
filed
a
second
cause
of
action
bringing
it
under
the
anti-injunction
suit.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well
sir,
as
i
read
the
three-judge
trial
court,
they
held
that
it
was
an
absolute
bar
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
sir?
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
where
mentioning
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
oh,
oh,
right,
right.
but,
it
--
they
issued
in
injunction
nevertheless
in
this
case,
the
present
case
in
joining
the
state
that
the
board
from
proceeding
with
a
hearing
on
the
charges.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
right.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
right,
right,
right.
now,
i
would
like
in
closing
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
mccrory
v.
wood
in
mississippi,
as
well
as
in
some
other
states,
sections
for
the
optometry
law
such
as
192
and
206
that
are
involved
here
are
constitutional,
and
for
what
that
might
be
worth
and
the
consideration
given
this
case
by
this
honorable
court
that
that
is
the
situation.
we
sincerely
trust
that
this
honorable
court
will
take
cognizance
of
the
extreme
importance
on
all
licensing
boards
of
the
decision
rendered
in
this
case
because
throughout
the
country,
practically
all
licensing
boards
in
the
professional
healthcare
field
have
similar
provisions
as
to
appointment
of
members
of
the
board
and
similar
provisions
as
to
membership
in
the
association,
and
in
general
appeals
from
charges
that
are
heard
before
the
board.
so,
i
thank
you
and
i
appreciate
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well,
it
came
up
here.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well,
the
mitchum
case
--
i
know
the
bay
springs
case
or
the
florida
case
was
in
our
favor
when
it
came
up
here.
and
yes
sir,
and
the
mitchum
case
was
in
our
favor
when
it
came
up
here.
but
when
it
went
back,
this
court
held
that
the
exception
of
the
civil
rights
act,
the
general
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
suit
applied,
and
they
reversed
the
dismissal
that
the
--
that
thereto
for
have
been
made,
if
i
am
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
well
sir,
there
had
been
so
many
things
happened
to
this
lawsuit
and
so
many
decisions
rendered
between
now
and
then
in
all
younger
being
the
first
one
that
i
would
just
hesitate
to
say
sir,
except
that
i
--
we
treated
with
it
in
our
brief
as
sincerely
as
we
possibly
could
of
the
cases
that
where
decided
up
until
that
time.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
and
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
right.
but
in
our
briefs
of
making
up
to
pleadings,
we
did
cite
younger,
which
had
just
come
out.
mr.
richard
a.
billups,
jr.
thank
you
so
much.
