justice
thurgood
marshall
you
already
mentioned
that.
did
shapiro
do
anything
when
this
was
being
made
other
than
to
furnish
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand,
he
did
nothing
else
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i
think.
justice
thurgood
marshall
plus
in
this
case
on
the
second
occasion,
he
had
got
the
materials
some
place
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
how
--
what
particular
act
went
too
far
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
--
which
he
could’ve
obtained
any
place
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
doesn’t
the
record
show
you
did
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
show
that
on
the
second
occasion,
he
did
obtained
it
from
some
place
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
in
that
extra
bottle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn’t
say
so
either.
what
i
said
it
was
obtained?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
was
obtainable.
you
said
it
wasn’t
obtainable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
anything
the
record
to
show
that
there
was
no
way
for
them
to
obtain
this
except
through
a
government
agent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
facilitated
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
facilitated
it.
suppose
the
agent
gave
the
paper
for
counterfeit
money,
would
that
be
entrapment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
guaranteed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
reason
is
you
can
obtain
that
paper
any
place
else
except
from
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
easily,
easily
at
this
term
and
to
be
counterfeit
bills
unless
they
have
the
right
papers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
all
that
the
speed
in
this
country
that
we
read
about
outside
to
this
record,
is
that
all
obtained
from
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
is
obtainable,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
this
ingredient
is
obtainable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
the
record
show
that
this
man
had
been
manufacturing
it
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
he
get
that
speed
tablet
that
he
gave
shapiro
on
the
first
trip?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
did
he
give
it
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
was
speed
there
in
this
room,
and
it
was
there
before
the
government
furnished
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
your
position
that
richard
russell
wouldn’t
gotten
involved
because
agent
hadn’t
talked
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
of
course
it
also
follows
that
you
wouldn’t
want
it
for
something
else,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
only
wanted
to
make
an
illegal
drug?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
the
government
makes
you
difficult.
suppose
the
government
froze
it
up
and
only
had
it
available
at
one
address
and
they
have
been
all
under
surveillance,
would
that
be
entrapment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
your
position
is
that
the
government
makes
it
possible
in
anyway
for
them
to
get
it,
they
can’t
prosecute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
promote
this
first
batch
before
shapiro
got
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
government
promote
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
somebody
guilty
of
that
crime
whoever
made
that
speed,
russell
or
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
government
did
promote
that,
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
government
persuaded
russell
to
go
in
speed
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
all
intents
and
purposes
that’s
your
position?
