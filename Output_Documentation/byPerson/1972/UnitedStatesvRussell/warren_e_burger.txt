chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-1585,
united
states
against
russell.
mr.
lacovara
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
court
appeals
added
another
layer
of
doctrine
as
an
independent
doctrine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
on
with
that,
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
--
about
a
factual
matter.
do
i
understand
correctly
from
what
you
said
that
on
the
second
day
or
on
the
later
day
when
the
agent,
the
undercover
agent
came
back,
he
stood
by
and
witnessed
the
activity
of
making
this
drug
from
ingredients
which
the
respondent
here
had
secured
from
an
independent
source?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
on
that
day,
he
was
witnessing
illegal
activity
in
which
he
had
no
participation
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
was
in
the
first
batch,
not
in
the
second
batch?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
some
of
these
was
made
from
this
one
essential
ingredient
which
the
respondent
had
obtained
on
his
own
from
some
other
source?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
jury
believes
the
defendant’s
version
of
the
facts
in
that
case,
that
would
be
what
chief
justice
hughes
was
talking
about,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
everything
that
hughes
said
was
purpose
by
the
--
and
if
that
was
either
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brucker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
majority
or
dissenting
or
concurring
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
suggest
there’s
nothing
new
in
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
to
this
problem
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
way
you’ve
described
it,
it
look
like
quite
of
production
line
there
with
four,
five
or
six
people
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
speaking
of
production
line
for
the
production
of
the
speed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
like
a
home-made
stew?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
it’s
a
production
line
nevertheless?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
produce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
the
agent’s
appearance,
during
the
agent’s
participation
and
at
times
after
he
had
left?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
he
just
lived,
in
your
view,
he
is
just
living
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
what
you’re
doing
in
that
if
i'm
going
to
suggest
mr.
brucker,
you’re
arguing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
a
different
question
from
the
legal
question
you’d
agree,
wouldn’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
it
was
black
carbonated
soda
that
they
needed
to
complete
this
process
and
they
didn’t
have
any
in
the
house
that
day
and
the
stores
were
closed
and
the
agents
had
supplied
one
for
them.
he
said,
he
had
some
at
home
and
went
home
and
got
it
and
brought
it
back.
would
you
think
situation
would
be
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
different
case
factually
from
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
substance
was
obtainable
from
other
sources
as
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
stores
are
closed,
it’s
difficult
to
get
that
black
carbonated
soda
unless
you
some
borrow
some
from
the
neighbor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
when
the
man
goes
around
to
five
or
six
places
and
can’t
give
any,
then,
his
appetite
is
whetted,
he
is
an
extreme
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
brucker.
mr.
brucker
you
appeared
here
at
our
request
and
by

of
the
