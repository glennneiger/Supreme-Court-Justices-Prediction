mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
if
i
might
as
to
what
i
think
this
case
is
all
about.
i
would
then
like
to
emphasize
some
matters
in
the
factual
aspects
of
this
case
which
i
feel
are
very
important.
and
then
i
would
like
to
proceed
on
to
what
i
feel
is
the
law,
the
applicable
law
that
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
i
think
this
case
what
this
case
is
all
about
first
of
all
can
be
summarized
in
the
phrase
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
the
law.
and
the
analysis
must
focus
on
what
law,
what
are
we
talking
about?
many
courts
use
that
phrase
and
i
think
it’s
going
to
be
helpful
to
us
if
this
court
will
tell
us
what
law
we’re
talking
about.
now,
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
three
possible
laws
which
this
court
can
use.
first
of
all,
is
the
due
process
clause.
now,
this
would
come
from
statements
that
were
contained
in
the
sorrells,
sherman
and
reilly
versus
ohio.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
in
sorrells
we’ve
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
justice
roberts
makes
a
suggestion
that
it
has
been
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice
hughes
makes
a
suggestion
that
it
has
been
the
activities
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
are
such
that
due
process
consideration
is
applied.
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
warren
clearly
makes
that
statement
in
the
sherman
case
where
he
says
that
when
the
intolerable
activities
then
becomes
so
bad
that
they
rise
to
the
level
of
due
process
consideration
just
as
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
or
the
fifth
amendment
coerced
confession,
as
well
as
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
i
am
not
--
i
am
suggesting
there
is
nothing
new
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
what
i
am
saying
in
this
case
that
this
is
the
way
that
courts
have
analyzed
these
cases,
but
they
have
not
really
articulated
the
basic
problem
that
they
are
taking
about.
and
that
is
the
reaction
to
overzealous
law
enforcement
activities.
this
type
of
case
has
been
considered
by
the
courts
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
pre-district
courts,
the
highest
courts
of
the
state
of
illinois,
of
arizona,
the
appellate
court
of
new
mexico
and
they
have
all
agreed
with
our
view
i
believe.
that’s
why
i'm
saying
there
is
nothing
new.
this
is
one
--
this
is
the
articulation,
this
is
what
we’re
talking
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
the
second
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
sir
no,
no,
but
and
all
this
--
most
of
the
states
to
my
knowledge
all
of
the
states
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well,
it
would
be
no
-
not
necessary
you’re
talking,
-
yes,
in
the
future,
it
certainly
would
be
yes,
but
not,
you
mean,
not
as
far
as
opening
as
the
government
says
in
its
reply
brief
by
opening
up
the
gates
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
is
correct,
that’s
right,
that’s
right
because
what
i'm
saying
here
is
the
government
has
going
far
further.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
is
correct,
but
there
is
one
suggestion
of
course
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
separate
opinion
in
sherman
where
he
does
suggest
an
equal
protection
argument
where
there
is
with
treating
classes
of
individual
differently
whether
or
not
they
have
a
predisposition.
he
questioned
whether
that
was
the
equal
protection,
but
certainly
the
holdings
have
not
risen
to
that
level.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes
it
could.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
it
could
do.
certainly
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
is
for
purposes
of
analysis
that
this
is
really
what
we’re
talking
about
because
the
level
of
government
activity
has
going
too
far.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
the
providing
of
phenyl-2-propanone
without
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
excuse
me,
absolutely
not.
we
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
there
was
no
laboratory
analysis
of
that
extra
bottle,
first
of
all
despite
what
the
government
says,
the
record
is
clear
about
that.
the
second
bottle
was
obtained
in
a
search
on
january
10,
1970.
richard
russell,
my
client,
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
this
was
in
connelly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
it
was
obtained
somebody
else.
what
difference
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
what
i'm
--
i'm
saying
two
things;
one,
if
all
we’ve
--
we
don’t
know
although
i'm
not
pressing
this.
we
don’t
know
that
it
was
in
fact
phenyl-2-propanone.
it
was
not
analyzed
by
the
government
agent
who
testified
at
this
trial.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
what
it
shows
is
that
the
government
agents,
the
government
b
and
d
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
they
had
dried
up
the
supply.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
that’s
what
mcgrath
held,
that’s
what
mcgrath
held.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
certainly.
the
government
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
oh!
but
that
doesn’t
prevent
counterfeit
bills
from
being
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well,
from
the
point
--
if
you
--
from
that
point
of
view,
if
you
have
the
right
waive
of
paper
in
that
type
of
thing,
the
only
way
that
come
is
from
the
government.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
speed
is
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well,
propanone
is
not
necessary
for
all
types
of
manufacture
of
speed
your
honor.
there
was
just
in
this
particular
type
of
manufacture.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
and
that
is
something
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
he
did
not
give
it
to
shapiro.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
he
didn’t
--
mr.
russell
did
not
give
it
anybody,
it
was
patrick
connelly.
there
were
many
people
in
this
room
where
agent
shapiro
came
in.
they
were
the
two
connelly
brothers,
there
was
richard
russell,
there
was
the
government
informant,
there
was
another
man
and
there
were
two
girls
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
but
not
--
but
richard
russell
had
--
the
only
thing
richard
russell
had
to
do
with
that,
i’ve
suggested
in
my
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
it
is
my
from
an
argument
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted
would
have
gone
ahead
without
shapiro
giving
the
phenyl-2-propanone.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
your
honor,
this
is
the
way,
this
is
on
whidbey
island
which
is
north
of
seattle
and
was
a
home
and
these
people
are
not
particularly
organizing
people
come
and
go.
this
is
the
common
way
of
life
for
an
authorize
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
oh!
no
your
honor.
this
was
as
the
record
reflects,
this
was
in
the
kitchen
then
and
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that’s
right,
sure.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes
it
did.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that’s
not
to
suggest
that
richard
russell
had
anything
to
do
with
that.
that’s
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
your
honor.
this
was
not
his
house.
this
was
patrick
connelly’s
house
which
is
15
miles
away
from
richard
russell’s
house.
unless
i
get
the
point
across
to
this
court
that
richard
russell
did
not
do
the
acts
both
before
and
after,
we’re
going
to
have
to
get
to
the
predisposition
argument.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
absolutely,
i
am
yes.
i
am
arguing
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well,
that
i
have
suggested
three
grounds
in
which
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
could
be
affirmed.
one
of
which
is
to
accept
their
due
process
consideration.
the
second
of
which
is
to
state
that
under
sorrells
and
sherman,
the
activities
of
the
government
arise
to
create
of
activity
and
manufacturing.
and
the
third
ground
is
that
under
the
supervisory
prior
to
this
court
to
adopt
the
separate
opinion
in
sherman
and
sorrells,
but
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
great
of
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
carry
the
issue
of
entrapment
to
the
jury.
the
important
facts
that
i
think
this
court
must
pay
attention
to
are
for:
one,
i
believe
--
first
of
all
is
that
the
proposal
to
a
supply
the
propanone
came
from
shapiro.
now,
shapiro
was
the
only
agent
that
testified,
but
there
were
four
or
five
surveiling
agents
outside
the
house
at
all
time;
this
was
wasn’t
a
one
man
operation.
they
knew
where
they
--
that
same
day
determine
where
the
laboratory
was,
but
i
think
it’s
important
that
the
offer
to
supply
came
from
a
government
agent.
this
is
not
a
situation
like
united
states
versus
lopez
where
the
defendant
made
a
non-solicited
offer
to
the
irs
agent
for
a
bribe.
so,
that
i
think
and
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
on
that
point.
the
second
aspect
that
i
think
is
important
in
the
factual
record
in
this
matter
is
the
critical
aspect
to
the
chemical
involved.
this
was
a
catalyst,
the
propanone
and
it
was
impossible
to
produce
speed
without
it.
you
could
have
all
the
laboratory,
all
the
flasks,
all
the
spoons,
all
the
bottles
as
everything
else
and
without
phenyl-2-propanone,
you
get
nothing.
as
a
record
reflects
here
and
you
can
have
everything
else
and
if
you
don’t
have
the
propanone,
you
could
not
manufacture
methamphetamines,
answer
is
no.
without
the
phenyl-2-propanone,
you
could
not
get
the
reaction
to
get
methamphetamine.
absent
of
propanone,
you
put
everything
else
in
there
described
by
mr.
shapiro,
what
would
you
get?
and
this
was
a
chemist
testifying.
not
a
great
deal
of
any
kind
of
products
you
see
because
the
product
depends
upon
the
reaction
of
phenyl-2-propanone,
that
is
the
whole
idea.
the
other
things
that
are
in
there
are
simply
for
solvents
or
for
the
generation
of
hydrogen
for
condensation.
so,
this
is
not
as
the
government
would
attempt
to
characterize,
this
is
just
an
isolated
drug
which
they
just
happened
to
provide.
it
was
absolute
hard
of
the
manufacture
of
speed
in
this
case,
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
speed,
that
the
chemical
provided
by
the
government
was
used
to
manufacture
the
speed.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
not
from
the
state
--
that
may
will
be,
but
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
true
in
this
case
just
from
the
testimony
of
the
chemist.
the
one
critical
item
is
a
phenyl-2-propanone
and
the
others
he
apparently,
he
said,
are
simply
for
solvents,
but
you
don’t
get
speed
unless
you
have
phenyl-2-propanone.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
i
find
that
as
a
different
case
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes
it
is.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
but
it
was
--
the
government
at
least
concedes
it
was
difficult
to
obtain.
i
mean
that’s
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
maybe,
although
i
just
--
to
me,
there’s
a
vast
distinction
between
something
which
is
available
in
every
drug
store
and
a
chemical
which
one
--
you
can
only
get
by
having
a
license
in
the
first
place
and
two,
which
agents
of
the
bureau
of
dangerous
drugs
have
gone
around
to
the
drug
supply
houses
and
say,
please,
don’t
sell
it
at
all
even
to
very
one
with
a
license.
so,
i
think
that
that
is
a
between
--
what
the
government
agents
have
done
is
to
dry
up
the
supply,
make
it
difficult
obtain
knowing
that
as
very
critical
item
and
then
say
here.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
but
the
other
point
might
also
be
true,
your
honor
and
that
is
if
can't
get
it
perhaps
he
wouldn’t
even
have
completed
the
manufacturing
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
there
is
a
difference
because
the
government
is
not
in
fact
--
the
agent
is
not
in
fact
providing,
but
i
don’t
see
meaningful
distinction
between
that
because
what
they
have
made
it
only
then
from
one
source.
and
that’s
in
it,
you
always
have
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
that’s
not
true
your
honor.
i'm
not
taking
that
position
at
all.
i'm
saying
what
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
what
the
government
is
doing
is
promoting
crime.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
absolutely
your
honor
because
what
they
are
doing
in
this
case
is
to
provide
something
that
without
which
for
all
the
record
shows.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
your
honor,
but
what
did
richard
russell
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
not
for
which
richard
russell
is
charged
and
which
this
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
somebody,
yes
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
but
that’s
not
the
charge
for
which
richard
russell
is
here
before
this
court
and
when
he
was
convicted
out.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
for
all,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
because
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
your
honor,
richard
russell
had
never
been
convicted
of
any
crime
before.
there
was
no
evidence
said
he
had
ever
been
involved
in
the
manufacturing.
there
was
not
even
the
evidence
as
to
the
involvement
of
russell
to
the
extent
of
mr.
sorrells.
the
record
--
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
sorrells
states
that
the
government
produced
three
witnesses
that
showed
that
mr.
sorrells
was
rum-runner,
but
there’s
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
richard
russell
was
anything
other
than
a
law
abiding
citizen.
they’re
just
isn’t
any,
richard
russell.
i
would
also
like
to
say
this
in
the
replied
brief
of
i
suggested
in
my
brief
that
the
government
show
where
there
was
such
a
evidence
in
the
record
and
in
the
reply
brief
they
declined
to
do
that
and
also
make
an
error
stating
that
it
was
richard
russell
who
made
statements
about
having
the
speed
and
that
was
corrected
this
morning
because
that
did
not
happen.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
it
is
your
honor
and
mr.
lacovara
spoke
actively
this
morning
on
page
4
of
the
reply
brief
in
the
second
paragraph
about
10
lines
from
the
bottom
talk
about
that
he
meaning
richard
russell,
but
obviously
was
one
of
the
connelly
brothers
and
mr.
lacovara
so
argued
this
morning.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
that
was
after
the
--
that
was
under
10th
of
december
1969,
that
was
after
shapiro
had
provided
the
chemical
and
the
drug
was
produced.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
oh!
i'm
taking
about
prior
to.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
prior
record,
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
oh!
that’s
correct,
right,
right.
he
clearly
committed
the
acts
in
this
case;
no
question
about
that.
what
i
am
basically
saying
and
what
i
basically
argue
to
this
court
is
that
this
court
has
not
heretofore
have
the
opportunity
to
consider
a
case
that
on
the
facts
where
the
government
has
provided
the
indispensable
ingredient,
the
contraband.
i'm
going
to
assume
now
that
richard
russell
has
all
kind
of
pres-disposition
that
he
was
involved
before
and
after,
although,
i
don’t
think
the
record
supports,
i’m
going
to
assume
that
now.
but
no
case
that
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
decide
has
going
to
the
extent
where
the
government
intrudes
itself
to
this
extent
in
the
prosecution
--
the
investigation
and
prosecution
of
crimes.
the
history
of
entrapment
has
been
basically
set
out
in
our
brief.
the
first
federal
case
on
was
as
recent
as
1915
and
it
was
basically
--
defense
of
entrapment
has
been
basically
caused
by
the
growth
of
the
statutory
crimes
where
there
is
a
clandestine
operations
and
it
is
hard
to
find
out
what
is
going
on.
by
the
time
of
1932
when
sorrells
was
decided,
mr.
justice
roberts
characterized
the
entrapment
defenses
as
an
amazing
total.
all
the
circuits
had
agreed
that
the
entrapment
defense
was
available
and
then
in
this
court
agreed.
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
is
that
we
have
a
parallel
situation
today.
this
different
factual
situation
where
the
government
intrudes
into
the
criminal
process
to
the
extent
that
it
has,
has
been
considered
by
many
courts,
the
lower
courts.
every
single
and
one
of
them
has
found
that
the
government
activity
is
intolerable
and
has
reversed
the
convictions,
every
single
on
them
without
dissent
except
in
my
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
here.
mcgrath,
bueno,
fifth
circuit,
seventh
circuit,
district
court
cases
southern
district
of
new
york,
california,
highest
court
of
illinois,
highest
court
of
arizona,
they
have
considered
problems
where
the
government
has
intruded
to
this
extent.
they’ve
all
found
them
bad
and
that’s
why
i'm
saying
that
we
have
a
different
case
that
is
not
been
considered
by
this
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
they
have
not
your
honor,
but
they
have
--
except
this
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
courts
below
have
tortured
their
reasoning,
tortured
their
opinions
because
they
are
outraged
by
what
the
government
does,
but
can’t
find
a
handle
on
which
to
articulate
what
the
basis
is,
what
law
they’re
talking
about
is
to
why
its
bad.
they
are
talking
about
enlarging
the
holding
of
sorrells
and
sherman.
they
talk
about
that
the
really
that
because
this
court
has
invited
review
of
this
the
--
what
really
now
is
the
law
is
its
separate
opinion
in
sherman
and
sorrells
but
nobody
--
they
are
unanimous
and
reversing,
but
they
are
not
unanimous
in
their
reasoning
and
we
all
look
to
this
court
for
its
reasoning.
what
i
am
saying
that
this
type
of
thing
had
never
been
considered
before.
it
is
alright
for
the
government
to
provide
a
substitute
crime.
that’s
what
entrapment
is;
providing
a
substitute
crime,
but
it
is
not
alright
for
the
government
to
go
further.
there’s
no
legitimate
state
interest
in
the
government
going
further
and
providing
the
one
means
by
which
that
crime
could
be
committed
and
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about;
without
shapiro
providing
that
phenyl-2-propanone.
the
evidence
does
not
support
the
fact
that
this
crime
would
be
committed,
and
i
got
to
look
at
that
problem
in
deciding
this
case.
the
evils
to
be
countenanced
are
set
fort
in
my
brief.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
articulated
them
in
the
separate
opinion
of
sherman.
i
don’t
like
to
go
with
slogans,
but
i
would
only
suggest
to
the
court
that
at
this
type
of
activity
is
upheld,
it
would
be
the
ends
justifying
the
means
which
is
really
not
sanctioned
in
our
system
and
for
those
reasons,
i
asked
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
if
i
might
as
to
what
i
think
this
case
is
all
about.
i
would
then
like
to
emphasize
some
matters
in
the
factual
aspects
of
this
case
which
i
feel
are
very
important.
and
then
i
would
like
to
proceed
on
to
what
i
feel
is
the
law,
the
applicable
law
that
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
i
think
this
case
what
this
case
is
all
about
first
of
all
can
be
summarized
in
the
phrase
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
the
law.
and
the
analysis
must
focus
on
what
law,
what
are
we
talking
about?
many
courts
use
that
phrase
and
i
think
it’s
going
to
be
helpful
to
us
if
this
court
will
tell
us
what
law
we’re
talking
about.
now,
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
three
possible
laws
which
this
court
can
use.
first
of
all,
is
the
due
process
clause.
now,
this
would
come
from
statements
that
were
contained
in
the
sorrells,
sherman
and
reilly
versus
ohio.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
in
sorrells
we’ve
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
justice
roberts
makes
a
suggestion
that
it
has
been
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice
hughes
makes
a
suggestion
that
it
has
been
the
activities
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
are
such
that
due
process
consideration
is
applied.
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
warren
clearly
makes
that
statement
in
the
sherman
case
where
he
says
that
when
the
intolerable
activities
then
becomes
so
bad
that
they
rise
to
the
level
of
due
process
consideration
just
as
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
or
the
fifth
amendment
coerced
confession,
as
well
as
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
i
am
not
--
i
am
suggesting
there
is
nothing
new
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
what
i
am
saying
in
this
case
that
this
is
the
way
that
courts
have
analyzed
these
cases,
but
they
have
not
really
articulated
the
basic
problem
that
they
are
taking
about.
and
that
is
the
reaction
to
overzealous
law
enforcement
activities.
this
type
of
case
has
been
considered
by
the
courts
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
pre-district
courts,
the
highest
courts
of
the
state
of
illinois,
of
arizona,
the
appellate
court
of
new
mexico
and
they
have
all
agreed
with
our
view
i
believe.
that’s
why
i'm
saying
there
is
nothing
new.
this
is
one
--
this
is
the
articulation,
this
is
what
we’re
talking
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
the
second
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
sir
no,
no,
but
and
all
this
--
most
of
the
states
to
my
knowledge
all
of
the
states
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well,
it
would
be
no
-
not
necessary
you’re
talking,
-
yes,
in
the
future,
it
certainly
would
be
yes,
but
not,
you
mean,
not
as
far
as
opening
as
the
government
says
in
its
reply
brief
by
opening
up
the
gates
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
is
correct,
that’s
right,
that’s
right
because
what
i'm
saying
here
is
the
government
has
going
far
further.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
is
correct,
but
there
is
one
suggestion
of
course
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
separate
opinion
in
sherman
where
he
does
suggest
an
equal
protection
argument
where
there
is
with
treating
classes
of
individual
differently
whether
or
not
they
have
a
predisposition.
he
questioned
whether
that
was
the
equal
protection,
but
certainly
the
holdings
have
not
risen
to
that
level.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes
it
could.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
it
could
do.
certainly
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
is
for
purposes
of
analysis
that
this
is
really
what
we’re
talking
about
because
the
level
of
government
activity
has
going
too
far.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
the
providing
of
phenyl-2-propanone
without
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
excuse
me,
absolutely
not.
we
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
there
was
no
laboratory
analysis
of
that
extra
bottle,
first
of
all
despite
what
the
government
says,
the
record
is
clear
about
that.
the
second
bottle
was
obtained
in
a
search
on
january
10,
1970.
richard
russell,
my
client,
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
this
was
in
connelly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
it
was
obtained
somebody
else.
what
difference
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
what
i'm
--
i'm
saying
two
things;
one,
if
all
we’ve
--
we
don’t
know
although
i'm
not
pressing
this.
we
don’t
know
that
it
was
in
fact
phenyl-2-propanone.
it
was
not
analyzed
by
the
government
agent
who
testified
at
this
trial.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
what
it
shows
is
that
the
government
agents,
the
government
b
and
d
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
they
had
dried
up
the
supply.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
that’s
what
mcgrath
held,
that’s
what
mcgrath
held.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
certainly.
the
government
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
oh!
but
that
doesn’t
prevent
counterfeit
bills
from
being
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well,
from
the
point
--
if
you
--
from
that
point
of
view,
if
you
have
the
right
waive
of
paper
in
that
type
of
thing,
the
only
way
that
come
is
from
the
government.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
speed
is
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well,
propanone
is
not
necessary
for
all
types
of
manufacture
of
speed
your
honor.
there
was
just
in
this
particular
type
of
manufacture.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
and
that
is
something
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
he
did
not
give
it
to
shapiro.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
he
didn’t
--
mr.
russell
did
not
give
it
anybody,
it
was
patrick
connelly.
there
were
many
people
in
this
room
where
agent
shapiro
came
in.
they
were
the
two
connelly
brothers,
there
was
richard
russell,
there
was
the
government
informant,
there
was
another
man
and
there
were
two
girls
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
but
not
--
but
richard
russell
had
--
the
only
thing
richard
russell
had
to
do
with
that,
i’ve
suggested
in
my
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
it
is
my
from
an
argument
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted
would
have
gone
ahead
without
shapiro
giving
the
phenyl-2-propanone.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
your
honor,
this
is
the
way,
this
is
on
whidbey
island
which
is
north
of
seattle
and
was
a
home
and
these
people
are
not
particularly
organizing
people
come
and
go.
this
is
the
common
way
of
life
for
an
authorize
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
oh!
no
your
honor.
this
was
as
the
record
reflects,
this
was
in
the
kitchen
then
and
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that’s
right,
sure.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes
it
did.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that’s
not
to
suggest
that
richard
russell
had
anything
to
do
with
that.
that’s
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
your
honor.
this
was
not
his
house.
this
was
patrick
connelly’s
house
which
is
15
miles
away
from
richard
russell’s
house.
unless
i
get
the
point
across
to
this
court
that
richard
russell
did
not
do
the
acts
both
before
and
after,
we’re
going
to
have
to
get
to
the
predisposition
argument.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
absolutely,
i
am
yes.
i
am
arguing
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
well,
that
i
have
suggested
three
grounds
in
which
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
could
be
affirmed.
one
of
which
is
to
accept
their
due
process
consideration.
the
second
of
which
is
to
state
that
under
sorrells
and
sherman,
the
activities
of
the
government
arise
to
create
of
activity
and
manufacturing.
and
the
third
ground
is
that
under
the
supervisory
prior
to
this
court
to
adopt
the
separate
opinion
in
sherman
and
sorrells,
but
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
great
of
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
carry
the
issue
of
entrapment
to
the
jury.
the
important
facts
that
i
think
this
court
must
pay
attention
to
are
for:
one,
i
believe
--
first
of
all
is
that
the
proposal
to
a
supply
the
propanone
came
from
shapiro.
now,
shapiro
was
the
only
agent
that
testified,
but
there
were
four
or
five
surveiling
agents
outside
the
house
at
all
time;
this
was
wasn’t
a
one
man
operation.
they
knew
where
they
--
that
same
day
determine
where
the
laboratory
was,
but
i
think
it’s
important
that
the
offer
to
supply
came
from
a
government
agent.
this
is
not
a
situation
like
united
states
versus
lopez
where
the
defendant
made
a
non-solicited
offer
to
the
irs
agent
for
a
bribe.
so,
that
i
think
and
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
on
that
point.
the
second
aspect
that
i
think
is
important
in
the
factual
record
in
this
matter
is
the
critical
aspect
to
the
chemical
involved.
this
was
a
catalyst,
the
propanone
and
it
was
impossible
to
produce
speed
without
it.
you
could
have
all
the
laboratory,
all
the
flasks,
all
the
spoons,
all
the
bottles
as
everything
else
and
without
phenyl-2-propanone,
you
get
nothing.
as
a
record
reflects
here
and
you
can
have
everything
else
and
if
you
don’t
have
the
propanone,
you
could
not
manufacture
methamphetamines,
answer
is
no.
without
the
phenyl-2-propanone,
you
could
not
get
the
reaction
to
get
methamphetamine.
absent
of
propanone,
you
put
everything
else
in
there
described
by
mr.
shapiro,
what
would
you
get?
and
this
was
a
chemist
testifying.
not
a
great
deal
of
any
kind
of
products
you
see
because
the
product
depends
upon
the
reaction
of
phenyl-2-propanone,
that
is
the
whole
idea.
the
other
things
that
are
in
there
are
simply
for
solvents
or
for
the
generation
of
hydrogen
for
condensation.
so,
this
is
not
as
the
government
would
attempt
to
characterize,
this
is
just
an
isolated
drug
which
they
just
happened
to
provide.
it
was
absolute
hard
of
the
manufacture
of
speed
in
this
case,
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
speed,
that
the
chemical
provided
by
the
government
was
used
to
manufacture
the
speed.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
not
from
the
state
--
that
may
will
be,
but
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
true
in
this
case
just
from
the
testimony
of
the
chemist.
the
one
critical
item
is
a
phenyl-2-propanone
and
the
others
he
apparently,
he
said,
are
simply
for
solvents,
but
you
don’t
get
speed
unless
you
have
phenyl-2-propanone.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
i
find
that
as
a
different
case
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes
it
is.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
but
it
was
--
the
government
at
least
concedes
it
was
difficult
to
obtain.
i
mean
that’s
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that
maybe,
although
i
just
--
to
me,
there’s
a
vast
distinction
between
something
which
is
available
in
every
drug
store
and
a
chemical
which
one
--
you
can
only
get
by
having
a
license
in
the
first
place
and
two,
which
agents
of
the
bureau
of
dangerous
drugs
have
gone
around
to
the
drug
supply
houses
and
say,
please,
don’t
sell
it
at
all
even
to
very
one
with
a
license.
so,
i
think
that
that
is
a
between
--
what
the
government
agents
have
done
is
to
dry
up
the
supply,
make
it
difficult
obtain
knowing
that
as
very
critical
item
and
then
say
here.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
but
the
other
point
might
also
be
true,
your
honor
and
that
is
if
can't
get
it
perhaps
he
wouldn’t
even
have
completed
the
manufacturing
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
there
is
a
difference
because
the
government
is
not
in
fact
--
the
agent
is
not
in
fact
providing,
but
i
don’t
see
meaningful
distinction
between
that
because
what
they
have
made
it
only
then
from
one
source.
and
that’s
in
it,
you
always
have
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
that’s
not
true
your
honor.
i'm
not
taking
that
position
at
all.
i'm
saying
what
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
what
the
government
is
doing
is
promoting
crime.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
absolutely
your
honor
because
what
they
are
doing
in
this
case
is
to
provide
something
that
without
which
for
all
the
record
shows.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
your
honor,
but
what
did
richard
russell
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
not
for
which
richard
russell
is
charged
and
which
this
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
somebody,
yes
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
but
that’s
not
the
charge
for
which
richard
russell
is
here
before
this
court
and
when
he
was
convicted
out.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
for
all,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
because
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
your
honor,
richard
russell
had
never
been
convicted
of
any
crime
before.
there
was
no
evidence
said
he
had
ever
been
involved
in
the
manufacturing.
there
was
not
even
the
evidence
as
to
the
involvement
of
russell
to
the
extent
of
mr.
sorrells.
the
record
--
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
sorrells
states
that
the
government
produced
three
witnesses
that
showed
that
mr.
sorrells
was
rum-runner,
but
there’s
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
richard
russell
was
anything
other
than
a
law
abiding
citizen.
they’re
just
isn’t
any,
richard
russell.
i
would
also
like
to
say
this
in
the
replied
brief
of
i
suggested
in
my
brief
that
the
government
show
where
there
was
such
a
evidence
in
the
record
and
in
the
reply
brief
they
declined
to
do
that
and
also
make
an
error
stating
that
it
was
richard
russell
who
made
statements
about
having
the
speed
and
that
was
corrected
this
morning
because
that
did
not
happen.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
it
is
your
honor
and
mr.
lacovara
spoke
actively
this
morning
on
page
4
of
the
reply
brief
in
the
second
paragraph
about
10
lines
from
the
bottom
talk
about
that
he
meaning
richard
russell,
but
obviously
was
one
of
the
connelly
brothers
and
mr.
lacovara
so
argued
this
morning.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
yes,
that
was
after
the
--
that
was
under
10th
of
december
1969,
that
was
after
shapiro
had
provided
the
chemical
and
the
drug
was
produced.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
oh!
i'm
taking
about
prior
to.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
prior
record,
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
oh!
that’s
correct,
right,
right.
he
clearly
committed
the
acts
in
this
case;
no
question
about
that.
what
i
am
basically
saying
and
what
i
basically
argue
to
this
court
is
that
this
court
has
not
heretofore
have
the
opportunity
to
consider
a
case
that
on
the
facts
where
the
government
has
provided
the
indispensable
ingredient,
the
contraband.
i'm
going
to
assume
now
that
richard
russell
has
all
kind
of
pres-disposition
that
he
was
involved
before
and
after,
although,
i
don’t
think
the
record
supports,
i’m
going
to
assume
that
now.
but
no
case
that
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
decide
has
going
to
the
extent
where
the
government
intrudes
itself
to
this
extent
in
the
prosecution
--
the
investigation
and
prosecution
of
crimes.
the
history
of
entrapment
has
been
basically
set
out
in
our
brief.
the
first
federal
case
on
was
as
recent
as
1915
and
it
was
basically
--
defense
of
entrapment
has
been
basically
caused
by
the
growth
of
the
statutory
crimes
where
there
is
a
clandestine
operations
and
it
is
hard
to
find
out
what
is
going
on.
by
the
time
of
1932
when
sorrells
was
decided,
mr.
justice
roberts
characterized
the
entrapment
defenses
as
an
amazing
total.
all
the
circuits
had
agreed
that
the
entrapment
defense
was
available
and
then
in
this
court
agreed.
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
is
that
we
have
a
parallel
situation
today.
this
different
factual
situation
where
the
government
intrudes
into
the
criminal
process
to
the
extent
that
it
has,
has
been
considered
by
many
courts,
the
lower
courts.
every
single
and
one
of
them
has
found
that
the
government
activity
is
intolerable
and
has
reversed
the
convictions,
every
single
on
them
without
dissent
except
in
my
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
here.
mcgrath,
bueno,
fifth
circuit,
seventh
circuit,
district
court
cases
southern
district
of
new
york,
california,
highest
court
of
illinois,
highest
court
of
arizona,
they
have
considered
problems
where
the
government
has
intruded
to
this
extent.
they’ve
all
found
them
bad
and
that’s
why
i'm
saying
that
we
have
a
different
case
that
is
not
been
considered
by
this
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
they
have
not
your
honor,
but
they
have
--
except
this
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
no,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
courts
below
have
tortured
their
reasoning,
tortured
their
opinions
because
they
are
outraged
by
what
the
government
does,
but
can’t
find
a
handle
on
which
to
articulate
what
the
basis
is,
what
law
they’re
talking
about
is
to
why
its
bad.
they
are
talking
about
enlarging
the
holding
of
sorrells
and
sherman.
they
talk
about
that
the
really
that
because
this
court
has
invited
review
of
this
the
--
what
really
now
is
the
law
is
its
separate
opinion
in
sherman
and
sorrells
but
nobody
--
they
are
unanimous
and
reversing,
but
they
are
not
unanimous
in
their
reasoning
and
we
all
look
to
this
court
for
its
reasoning.
what
i
am
saying
that
this
type
of
thing
had
never
been
considered
before.
it
is
alright
for
the
government
to
provide
a
substitute
crime.
that’s
what
entrapment
is;
providing
a
substitute
crime,
but
it
is
not
alright
for
the
government
to
go
further.
there’s
no
legitimate
state
interest
in
the
government
going
further
and
providing
the
one
means
by
which
that
crime
could
be
committed
and
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about;
without
shapiro
providing
that
phenyl-2-propanone.
the
evidence
does
not
support
the
fact
that
this
crime
would
be
committed,
and
i
got
to
look
at
that
problem
in
deciding
this
case.
the
evils
to
be
countenanced
are
set
fort
in
my
brief.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
articulated
them
in
the
separate
opinion
of
sherman.
i
don’t
like
to
go
with
slogans,
but
i
would
only
suggest
to
the
court
that
at
this
type
of
activity
is
upheld,
it
would
be
the
ends
justifying
the
means
which
is
really
not
sanctioned
in
our
system
and
for
those
reasons,
i
asked
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
thomas
h.
s.
brucker
thank
you.
