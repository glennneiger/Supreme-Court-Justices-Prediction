mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
united
states
against
russell
involves
a
very
important
issue
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
basically,
whether
a
new
defense
to
criminal
liability
is
to
be
created
that
will
focus
exclusively
on
the
nature
of
the
conduct
of
an
investigative
agent
in
uncovering
and
detecting
the
criminal
enterprise.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
from
which
this
case
comes
has
held
that
such
a
defense
should
be
created.
the
facts
are
basically
simple
and
they
are
very
few
and
probably
no
relevant
controversies
about
the
facts.
on
december
7,
1969,
an
undercover
agent
for
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
accompanied
by
an
informant,
went
to
the
home
of
the
respondent,
richard
russell
and
there
met
with
mr.
russell
and
two
other
co-defendants
in
this
case,
john
connolly
and
patrick
connolly.
the
agent
in
his
testimony,
set
forth
on
page
4
of
the
appendix,
explained
what
happened
when
he
went
to
mr.
russell’s
home.
i
told
richard
russell
and
the
two
connollys
that
i
represented
an
organization
interested
in
controlling
the
manufacture
of
methamphetamine,
that
is
the
dangerous
drug
involved
here.
and
then
i
represented
the
organization
in
the
northwest
area
and
i
wanted
to
meet
with
the
people
who
were
manufacturing
the
methamphetamine
and
i
wanted
to
obtain
methamphetamine
from
them.
the
agent
later
explained
that
the
terms
of
this
business
proposition
to
these
people
whom
he
said
he
understood
to
be
manufacturing
methamphetamine
was
that
he
would
supply
one
of
the
chemical
ingredients
in
the
manufacture
of
the
drug,
phenyl-2-propanone
in
return
for
half
of
the
output
and
he
would
like
to
buy
the
rest
of
the
output
for
cash.
without
any
attempt
to
disabuse
him
of
his
understanding
that
they
were
currently
manufacturing
methamphetamine
or
to
express
any
reluctance
whatsoever
to
the
business
proposition
the
undercover
agent
put,
patrick
connolly
said,
“we’ve
been
manufacturing
methamphetamine
since
at
least
may
of
1969
and
have
manufactured
about
three
pounds
of
it.”
i
might
say
for
purposes
of
illustration
that
i've
been
told
by
the
bureau
of
narcotics
that
the
average
medically
recommended
dose
of
methamphetamine
is
five
milligrams
according
to
the
u.s.
pharmacopeia.
the
average
illicit
dose
on
the
street
is
10
milligrams
which
means
that
each
gram
of
methamphetamine
will
produce
approximately
100
illicit
doses.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
453
grams
in
a
pound.
as
we
will
see
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
amount
of
methamphetamine
involved
in
this
case
would
be
enough
for
approximately
3,500
illicit
doses
and
perhaps
7,000
illicit
doses.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
methamphetamine
is
speed.
it’s
a
stimulant
drug.
the
prosecution
in
this
case
arises
under
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act.
that
act
is
now
been
superseded
by
the
1970
comprehensive
drug
abuse
and
control
act.
speed
remains
a
control
of
drug
under
the
new
statute
as
well.
the
agent
however
insisted
that
he
would
not
provide
any
of
this
important
ingredient
unless
and
until
the
three-man
partnership
whom
he
confronted
provided
him
with
both
the
sample
of
the
methamphetamine
they
had
already
manufactured,
and
also
showed
him
the
laboratory.
patrick
connolly
then
with
the
agent
left
mr.
russell’s
house,
brought
the
agent
to
his
own
home
where
he
showed
him
some
items
of
laboratory
equipment.
before
they
left
russell’s
house,
john
connolly
gave
the
agent
a
sample
which
he
said
“had
come
from
the
last
batch
that
had
been
manufactured.”
i
emphasize
that
at
no
time
did
richard
russell
in
whose
presence
that’s
all
occurred
attempt
to
dissociate
himself
from
the
enterprise.
pursuant
to
the
arrangement,
the
agent
return
to
russell’s
house
the
next,
december
8th,
but
was
told
by
russell
that
russell
and
patrick
connolly
had
been
unable
to
get
the
other
chemicals
necessary
to
manufacture
the
methamphetamine
because
they
had
arrived
too
late
at
the
chemical
supply
store
on
the
afternoon
of
the
8th.
now,
the
respondent’s
brief
indicates
that
the
record
shows
that
russell
and
patrick
connolly
had
tried
to
get
phenyl-2-propanone
and
had
it
had
been
refused
to
them.
i
believe
the
record
on
pages
17
and
18
shows
that
they
were
going
to
get
the
other
chemicals
and
simply
arrived
too
late
to
get
them.
in
any
event,
they
said
they
would
get
the
chemicals
the
following
day,
december
9th,
and
when
the
agent
return
to
mr.
russell’s
home,
the
home
of
the
respondent
on
the
afternoon
of
december
9th
waited
for
mr.
russell
and
mr.
connolly.
the
group
then
set
out
for
patrick
connolly’s
home
with
the
laboratory
was
located
and
after
patrick
connolly
and
richard
russell
began
the
chemical
process
by
adding
a
variety
of
other
chemicals
to
a
flask,
the
agent
then
upon
their
request
provided
them
with
a
bottle
of
100
grams
of
phenyl-2-propanone.
the
reaction
process
took
about
two
hours
according
to
the
agent’s
testimony
from
about
7:30
until
9:30.
after
that
began
the
separate
phase,
the
drying
and
crystallization
phase
which
was
done
on
a
hot
plate
with
the
ladies
home
hair
dryer.
at
about
12:40,
1/4
of
the
methamphetamine
had
been
dried;
that
is
after
the
beaker
or
flask
had
been
chemically
treated.
mr.
connolly
poured
the
liquid
into
four
separate
flasks
and
each
flask
was
then
dried
on
a
pyrex
baking
dish
separately.
so
at
12:40,
the
first
transfer
actually
took
place
and
that
was
approximately
10
grams
or
enough
for
about
a
thousand
doses,
illicit
doses.
agent
shapiro,
the
undercover
agent
left
the
connolly
home,
left
mr.
connolly
and
russell
there
and
unbeknown
to
them
secured
the
methamphetamine
that
it
been
given
in
his
office
in
seattle.
he
returned
the
next
morning
at
about
8
o’clock.
the
respondent
and
pat
connolly
where
still
there
drying
the
rest
of
the
speed.
after
russell
succeeded
in
scraping
off
the
remainder
or
the
crystalline
form
of
the
drug
into
three
more
bags
of
methamphetamine,
patrick
connolly
said
to
the
agent,
“you
may
have
the
rest
of
the
batch”
and
russell
according
to
the
testimony
interjected
after
i
get
my
half.
so,
the
agent
was
given
one
of
the
remaining
three
bags.
richard
russell,
the
respondent
took
the
other
two
bags.
the
agent
offered
to
buy
the
two
bags
for
cash
and
russell
said,
“that
he
already
made
arrangements
to
sell
one
of
those
bags
for
cash.”
in
the
course
of
the
drive
back
to
the
respondent's
home,
russell
agreed
to
sell
the
remaining
bag,
the
fourth
bag
to
the
undercover
agent
for
cash
and
at
his
home,
the
agent
paid
him
$60.00
and
purchased
approximately
9
1/2
grams
of
methamphetamine.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
same
agent
all
the
way
through.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
only
one
agent
involved
in
the
actual
transaction,
yes
sir.
about
three
weeks
later,
agent
shapiro
contacted
patrick
connolly
again
at
connolly’s
home
which
was
where
the
laboratory
was
located,
asked
him
if
he
was
still
interested
in
the
business
arrangement
and
connolly
replied
that
he
was
still
interested,
but
in
the
interim,
he
had
obtained
two
more
bottles
of
phenyl-2-propanone
which
was
the
commodity
of
the
agent
was
willing
to
supply
and
that
he
wouldn’t
be
finished
with
those
for
a
few
days.
a
few
days
later
along
with
the
search
warrant
and
an
arrest
warrant,
agent
shapiro
and
other
federal
agents
raided
mr.
connolly’s
home
laboratory
and
seized
over
a
100
items
that
were
admitted
at
the
trial,
included
were
chemical
supply
company
catalogs,
a
variety
of
chemicals,
laboratory
equipment,
and
three
bottles
of
phenyl-2-propanone.
one
was
the
100-gram
bottle
the
agent
had
supplied
and
which
he
was
able
identify.
his
second
empty
bottle
was
500-gram
bottle
labeled
to
p2p
which
chemical
analysis
showed
had
actually
contain
the
drug
and
the
third
bottle,
a
100-gram
bottle
of
p2p
was
still
half
full.
mr.
connelly
was
indicted
on
five
counts
involving
violations
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
mr.
russell
was
charged
with
three
violations;
manufacturing,
processing
and
compounding
as
one
count,
delivering
the
controlled
the
drug
at
the
time
the
first
transfer
had
taken
place,
and
the
third
count,
selling
a
control
of
drug
at
the
time
that
the
agent
purchased
the
final
bag
from
him.
now,
the
defense
at
the
trial
was
entrapment,
that
was
the
only
defense.
respondent,
however,
did
not
testify
of
patrick
connelly
did.
the
jury
found
him
guilty,
however,
on
all
counts.
mr.
connelly
in
his
testimony
admitted
having
told
the
agent
that
they
have
manufactured
at
least
three
pounds
of
it
before
the
agent
appeared
on
the
scene.
he
also
acknowledged
that
he
had
told
the
agent
that
he,
patrick,
handled
the
chemical
reaction
phase
of
the
business
that
his
brother
john
normally
did
the
drying
and
crystallization
phase
and
that
richard
russell,
the
respondent
here
took
care
of
the
sales
in
return
from
50%
of
the
profits.
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
standard
entrapment
instructions.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir,
he
didn’t
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination,
what
do
have
you
done?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
said,
he
may
have
picked
up
some
pieces
of
aluminum
foil,
aluminum
being
one
of
the
ingredients
after
they
have
fallen
to
floor
and
put
them
into
flask,
but
he
said
he
did
not
provide
any
other
resistance
and
he
did
not
advise
or
instruct
the
man
how
to
go
about
completing
the
reaction
or
in
any
other
way
not
assist
in
the
crystallization
either.
so
his
only
participation,
i
believe
this
is
agreed,
was
to
supply
the
100-grams
of
phenyl-2-propanone.
the
jury
under
the
standard
entrapment
instructions
which
focus
on
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
may
have
been
pre-disposed
to
commit
the
crime
before
the
undercover
agent
appeared
on
the
scene,
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdicts
of
guilty
on
all
counts
against
both
of
the
defendants
who
appeared
at
the
trial.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
they
are
on
page
17.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
the
first
two
paragraphs
were
contained
both
in
the
defendant’s
proposed
instructions
and
in
the
--
a
government’s
proposed
instructions.
they
are
for
the
standard
mathes
and
devitt.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
the
first
three
paragraphs
beginning
where
a
person
has
no
previews
intent
and
on
the
other
hand
where
a
person
already
has
the
willingness
and
readiness
to
break
the
law.
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
agent
provides
what
appears
to
be
a
favorable
opportunity
is
not
entrapment.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
the
objection
on
the
part
of
the
defense
at
trial
as
i
read
the
record
anyway
is
that
the
government
--
the
judge
did
not
sufficiently
defined
that
the
government
had
the
burden
of
showing
propensity
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
objections?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
not
in
the
appendix.
it
is
in
the
record,
however,
and
the
case
as
it
comes
to
this
court
does
not
rest
on
the
instructions.
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
instructions
correctly
stated
that
the
traditional
law
of
entrapment
and
i’ll
come
now
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
exactly.
the
court
of
appeals
took
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
right.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
specifically
provides
that
federal
and
state
agents
are
not
covered
by
the
normal
prohibitions
against
possession
or
dispensing
or
even
manufacturing
controlled
drug.
so,
nothing
that
the
agent
did
was
in
anyway
illegal
and
the
only
thing
that
he
did
was
deliver
one
of
the
ingredients
in
the
manufacture
of
the
drug.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
was
all
manufactured
from
the
same
ingredient.
as
i
say,
the
process
took
a
series
of
hours
at
about
he
arrived
in
the
evening
of
the
night
and
the
chemical
reaction
began
at
that
time.
shortly
after
midnight,
12:40
am
on
the
10th,
he
got
the
first
quarter
of
the
batch
which
had
been
dried
and
he
left
and
brought
that
to
his
office.
he
came
back
the
following
morning
and
russell
and
pat
connelly
were
still
working
on
the
remainder
of
the
methamphetamine
and
at
that
point,
the
agent
was
given
a
second
bag
and
purchased
the
third
bag
and
the
records
shows
that
the
respondent
would
up
with
the
fourth
bag.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
no.
there
was
delivered
to
the
agent
before
he
provided
them
with
any
phenyl-2-propanone,
a
sample
which
one
of
the
partnership
said
had
come
from
the
last
batch
they’d
manufactured.
then
after
the
batch
had
been
manufactured
with
the
ingredient
that
the
agent
supplied,
the
agent
returned
to
connelly’s
home
about
three
or
four
weeks
later
to
renew
the
business
arrangement
and
was
told
that
they
had
since
come
upon
a
new
source
of
phenyl-2-propanone
and
did
need
any
of
his
at
that
time.
but
all
of
the
methamphetamine
involved
in
this
prosecution
comes
from
a
chemical
reaction
which
included
the
phenyl-2-propanone
that
the
agent
provided.
that’s
the
posture
in
which
the
case
is
before
the
court.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
have
been
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
question
about
that.
the
evidence
of
the
subsequent
availability
of
phenyl-2-propanone
was
admitted
at
the
trial
because
it
showed
among
other
things
the
availability
of
this
ingredient
from
other
sources.
it
was
received
without
objection
i
believe.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
the
basic
argument
in
the
instructions
was
over
who
had
the
burden
of
proving
propensity
or
lack
of
propensity
to
commit
the
crime.
after
the
trial
and
a
memorandum
for
a
new
trial,
the
respondent’s
counsel
argued
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
delivery
of
an
ingredient
and
the
manufacture
of
the
methamphetamine
constituted
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
was
the
position
ultimately
upheld
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case.
so,
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
on
a
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
on
what
are
essentially
undisputed
facts.
the
ninth
circuit
saying
that
the
standard
entrapment
standards
would
not
be
met
in
this
case
because
mr.
russell’s
predisposition
amply
shown
by
the
record
had
been
virtually
conceded
and
in
the
opinion
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
trask
(ph)
actually
quotes
the
portion
of
respondent’s
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
conceding
that
the
jury
could
find
under
the
standard
entrapment
defense
that
he
was
pre-disposed
to
the
offense.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
his
two
theories
in
a
nutshell
are
these.
first
of
all,
his
focus
is
generally
on
the
some
of
the
statements
made
in
the
separate
opinions
of
the
minority
in
the
sorrells
and
sherman
cases
which
are
of
course
the
two
leading
entrapment
cases.
in
those
opinions,
justices
roberts
and
frankfurter
said
that
the
entrapment
offense
really
ought
to
focus
not
on
the
subjective
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
or
on
his
predisposition
to
commit
the
crime,
but
rather
ought
to
focus
only
on
the
nature
of
the
officer’s
conduct
and
if
that
conduct
is
intolerable,
then
there
ought
to
be
a
bar
to
the
prosecution.
we’ll
show
in
a
few
moments
that
that
rationale
is
not
applicable
to
this
kind
of
case
anyway.
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
under
one
of
two
theories
of
the
defendant
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law
to
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
first,
they
said,
it
is
intolerable
government
conduct
to
supply
contraband
to
a
defendant
and
then
prosecute
him
for
possession
of
the
contraband.
now,
the
court
said
by
some
process
of
extension
that
even
though
the
phenyl-2-propanone
was
not
contraband
is
not
and
was
not
a
regulated
to
the
chemical,
nevertheless,
without
the
delivery
of
that
contraband
could’ve
been
made
and
therefore
what
happened
here
was
intolerable.
that
the
court
said
was
a
kind
of
extension
of
the
traditional
entrapment
doctrine.
alternatively,
the
ninth
circuit,
judge
elli’s
opinion
said,
there
is
a
separate
kind
of
due
process
defense
that
ought
to
be
recognized
where
the
government
engages
in
too
much
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
when
the
government
becomes
enmeshed
in
the
enterprise
for
a
reason
similar
to
the
reasons
that
support
the
entrapment
defense,
the
government
ought
to
be
precluded
from
prosecuting.
here,
the
court
said,
because
the
undercover
agent
had
supplied
one
of
the
ingredients
and
had
been
present
during
the
manufacture,
that
precluded
the
government
from
prosecuting.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
right,
that
--
i’d
like
to
approach
now
for
sorrells
and
sherman
to
say
why
under
either
of
the
views
presented
in
those
cases,
the
indictment
in
this
case
ought
to
be
reinstated.
the
--
both
parties
to
the
case
of
rather
or
extensively
quoted
from
all
of
the
opinions
in
those
two
cases
and
i
won’t
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
read
extensively
from
them
except
to
say
that
the
difference
in
philosophy
is
basic.
chief
justice
hughes’
opinion
in
sorrells
and
chief
justice
warren’s
opinion
in
sherman
say
basically
what
we’re
talking
about
is
a
defense
to
criminal
liability.
and
the
basic
issue
in
terms
of
normal
criminal
law
standards
of
culpability
is,
did
the
intent
with
which
the
defendant
did
the
physical
acts
that
in
apparent
violation
of
the
statute
arise
on
his
own
or
was
that
criminal
design
manufactured
by
the
government?
in
analogy
to
standard
insanity
or
duress
from
the
state
concept,
the
man
is
just
not
criminally
liable
or
culpable
if
the
government
manufactured
the
criminal
intent.
and
the
court
in
both
to
those
cases
said,
this
is
consistent
with
what
we
would
understand
the
congressional
intent
to
be,
and
both
chief
justices
said
congress
didn’t
want
its
criminal
statutes
enforced
against
people
who
did
not
intend
to
violate
them
until
the
government
came
along.
the
separate
opinions
of
justice
roberts
and
justice
frankfurter
put
a
wholly
different
cast
on
it
and
said,
the
focus
ought
to
be
on
whether
the
conduct
of
the
investigators
is
tolerable
or
not
irrespective
of
normal
guilt
or
innocence
under
criminal
law
principles.
but
even
those
separate
opinions
and
this
is
basic,
state
what
is
to
called
the
objective
test
rather
than
the
subjective
test
and
it
is
not
the
kind
of
this
rule
or
subjective
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
here
terming
the
conduct
intolerable
or
repugnant
or
excessive
for
overzealous.
the
standard
stated
by
justice
frankfurter
and
we
quote
the
language
on
page
19
of
our
main
brief
is
this,
this
test
he
says,
shifts
attention
from
the
record
and
predisposition
of
the
particular
defendant
to
the
conduct
of
the
police
and
the
likelihood
objectively
considered
that
it
would
entrap
only
those
ready
and
willing
to
commit
the
crime.
it
is
as
--
this
has
been
proposed
in
the
model
penal
code
and
the
proposed
federal
code
and
the
introduction
senate
one
in
the
93rd
congress
which
is
the
official
senate
bill,
mclellans,
senator
mclellans
bill
for
revamping
the
whole
criminal
--
federal
criminal
code,
the
test
would
be
an
objective
one.
is
it
likely
that
the
conduct
that
the
agent
engaged
in
might
seduce
an
innocent
person
into
committing
a
crime.
if
it’s
that
kind
of
conduct,
we
don’t
care
under
this
test
whether
the
defendant
actually
had
a
criminal
design.
we
just
won’t
allow
the
government
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
conduct.
if
however,
it's
conduct
that
would
not
likely
ensnared
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
looking
only
at
the
agent’s
conduct,
then
there
is
to
be
no
defense.
that’s
the
objective
standard.
now,
in
this
case
of
course
applying
that
standard,
there
can
be
no
question,
but
that
objectively
considered
and
offered
to
someone
to
supply
an
ingredient
in
the
manufacture
of
an
illegal
drug
is
not
likely
to
tempt
or
to
seduce
the
ordinary
law
abiding
citizen
about
whom
justice
frankfurter
was
speaking
as
well
into
committing
the
crime.
these
statements
by
justice
roberts
and
justice
frankfurter
came
up
in
the
context
of
cases
where
it
might
be
thought
that
a
normally
law
abiding
citizen
might
have
fallen
from
grace
because
of
the
over
bearing
of
the
government
agent.
in
sorrells,
it
was
a
request
to
get
some
liquor
during
prohibition
for
an
old
army
buddy
and
it
might
have
been
thought
that
normal
social
behavior
might
ultimately
cause
a
person,
a
normally
law
abiding
person
to
yield
and
supply
a
kind
of
liquor.
in
sherman
of
course,
the
undercover
informant
attempted
another
former
narcotics
addict
who
was
undergoing
treatment
with
him
to
get
him
heroine
for
his
personal
use
saying
that
he
couldn’t
suffer
the
pain
of
withdrawal
and
finally,
the
perspective
defendant
yielded.
those
are
holes
apart
from
the
kind
of
conduct
here,
which
presents
no
risk
in
the
frankfurter
formulation
or
the
formulation
of
model
penal
code,
the
federal,
proposed
federal
code
or
s-1,
creates
no
risk
that
the
government
conduct
will
ensnare
the
otherwise
innocent
or
tempt
the
normally
law
abiding
citizen
as
in
the
federal
--
proposed
federal
code.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
there
were
some
indications
in
the
record
that
he
was
a
rum
runner,
but
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
all
the
court
held
in
sorrells
was
that
if
you
--
if
the
jury
had
credited
the
defense
testimony
which
was
that
he
didn’t
deal
in
liquor
and
had
a
good
reputation
in
the
community,
they
might
have
entertained
a
reasonable
doubt
which
is
the
current
standard
about
whether
he
had
to
pre-disposition.
so,
in
sorrells
all
that
happened
was
the
case
was
sent
back
for
a
new
trial
because
the
trial
court
it
held
that
it
would
not
even
submit
the
entrapment
question
to
the
jury.
all
that
court
held
was
that
under
one
view
of
the
evidence,
there
might
have
been
entrapment.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i’ll
have
to
leave
to
the
court
of
the
analysis.
the
theory
is
what
we’re
concerned
about
here.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
[laughter
attempt]
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that’s
exactly
right,
but
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
refused
to
let
the
jury
consider
that.
he
had
not
given
any
entrapment
instruction.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
right.
he
--
what
he
said
and
we
quote
this
language,
the
record
in
this
case
would
permit
the
jury
to
infer
that
the
man
was
otherwise
industrious,
that’s
the
language
you’re
referring
to,
but
he
wasn’t
talking
that
as
proving.
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
the
question
whether
the
creation
of
this
new
kind
of
defense
is
even
an
appropriate
exercise
of
judicial
power.
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
neither
under
the
due
process
clause
nor
under
what
is
called
the
court’s
supervisory
power
over
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
has
the
court
ever
asserted
or
exercise
the
power
to
create
a
new
defense
to
criminal
liability.
now,
chief
justice
hughes
in
the
sorrells’
opinion
specifically
rejects
this
proposition,
saying
the
courts
have
no
power
once
a
valid
statute
applicable
according
to
its
construction
is
involved
and
the
executive
chooses
to
prosecute,
the
courts
have
no
power
to
create
a
new
defense
to
exonerate
the
defendant
which
would
be
the
effect
of
the
holding
in
this
case.
we’ve
argued
at
some
length
in
our
brief
that
whether
you
regard
this
as
an
extension
of
the
entrapment
case
or
as
a
proposal
to
establish
a
new
due
process
defense,
there’s
no
basis
for
doing
it.
now
first
of
all,
the
technique
here
given
one
of
the
ingredients
to
be
used
in
the
manufacture
of
the
drug
fits
within
the
traditional
law
enforcement
technique
which
has
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
as
recently
as
in
osborn
against
the
united
states
in
385
u.s.
and
that
is,
it
is
not
unlawful
entrapment
to
provide
the
opportunity
or
facility
for
commission
of
a
crime,
if
the
criminal
intent
which
is
the
underlying
premise
of
criminal
prosecution
inheres
in
the
defendant
before
the
agent
appears
on
the
scene.
similarly,
there’s
no
inherent,
unfairness
here
in
this
kind
of
activity
we
believe.
i
think
we’ve
shown
in
our
brief
that
there
are
countervailing
reasons
from
law
enforcement
purposes
for
infiltrating
criminal
groups,
not
only
drug
groups,
but
organized
crime,
smuggling
and
espionage
groups,
but
nothing
that
was
done
here
violated
any
specific
provision
of
the
constitution.
the
court
in
hoffa,
osborn
and
lewis
has
specifically
rejected
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
amendment
challenges
to
undercover
operations
and
in
hoffa
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
this
violates
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
as
inherently
unfair.
we
therefore
request
that
the
judgment
follow
should
be
reversed
and
the
indictment
reinstated.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
would
i
would
call
a
minimal
concession,
mr.
justice.
what
we’re
talking
about
there
is,
if
the
only
thing
that
translated
a
fantasy
into
a
crime
was
the
appearance
of
the
government
agent,
well
then,
it
might
be
said
that
there
couldn’t
been
a
crime,
but
for
the
government
agent.
for
example,
if
some
people
at
college
smoker
decided
that
they
would
like
to
loot
fort
knox
and
there
was
an
undercover
agent
present
and
he
stimulated
the
scheme
and
because
of
his
official
position,
got
the
keys
to
the
vault
and
had
all
the
guards
taken
away
and
have
the
search
lights
turn
off
and
the
men
walk
in
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
yes
sir.
the
--
what
i
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
are
practical
constraints
on
the
occasions
in
which
undercover
agents
become
involved
in
schemes.
they
don’t
apply
to
violent
crimes,
even
the
proposed
formulations
would
not
allow
even
in
entrapment
defense
where
badly
injury
is
threatened.
but
to
illustrate
mr.
justice
if
i
may,
the
--
what
i
would
to
call
our
basic
theory
is
that
if
the
government
provides
a
fungible
commodity,
there
is
no
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
would
be
phenyl-2-propanone
here
because
it
could
be
obtained
from
other
sources.
it
was
difficult
to
obtain,
it
would
even
apply
to
heroine
or
the
counterfeit
bills
because
if
the
agent
isn’t
there
infiltrating
the
scheme,
monitoring
it
by
his
presence
in
participation,
it’s
very
probable
under
the
realities
of
the
criminal
world
that
the
heroine
or
the
counterfeit
bills
or
the
p2p
in
this
case
or
the
gun
in
your
case
will
come
from
someone
else.
and
that
is
a
legitimate
law
enforcement
objective
to
stay
right
close
to
the
transaction,
including
cooperating
with
the
scheme
to
the
extent
necessary
in
order
to
track
it
all
the
way
to
the
conclusion,
to
find
out
all
of
the
participants
and
then
nip
it
before
it
goes
any
further.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
the
--
patrick
connelly
had
apparently
600-gram
jars
of
p2p.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
united
states
against
russell
involves
a
very
important
issue
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
basically,
whether
a
new
defense
to
criminal
liability
is
to
be
created
that
will
focus
exclusively
on
the
nature
of
the
conduct
of
an
investigative
agent
in
uncovering
and
detecting
the
criminal
enterprise.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
from
which
this
case
comes
has
held
that
such
a
defense
should
be
created.
the
facts
are
basically
simple
and
they
are
very
few
and
probably
no
relevant
controversies
about
the
facts.
on
december
7,
1969,
an
undercover
agent
for
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
accompanied
by
an
informant,
went
to
the
home
of
the
respondent,
richard
russell
and
there
met
with
mr.
russell
and
two
other
co-defendants
in
this
case,
john
connolly
and
patrick
connolly.
the
agent
in
his
testimony,
set
forth
on
page
4
of
the
appendix,
explained
what
happened
when
he
went
to
mr.
russell’s
home.
i
told
richard
russell
and
the
two
connollys
that
i
represented
an
organization
interested
in
controlling
the
manufacture
of
methamphetamine,
that
is
the
dangerous
drug
involved
here.
and
then
i
represented
the
organization
in
the
northwest
area
and
i
wanted
to
meet
with
the
people
who
were
manufacturing
the
methamphetamine
and
i
wanted
to
obtain
methamphetamine
from
them.
the
agent
later
explained
that
the
terms
of
this
business
proposition
to
these
people
whom
he
said
he
understood
to
be
manufacturing
methamphetamine
was
that
he
would
supply
one
of
the
chemical
ingredients
in
the
manufacture
of
the
drug,
phenyl-2-propanone
in
return
for
half
of
the
output
and
he
would
like
to
buy
the
rest
of
the
output
for
cash.
without
any
attempt
to
disabuse
him
of
his
understanding
that
they
were
currently
manufacturing
methamphetamine
or
to
express
any
reluctance
whatsoever
to
the
business
proposition
the
undercover
agent
put,
patrick
connolly
said,
“we’ve
been
manufacturing
methamphetamine
since
at
least
may
of
1969
and
have
manufactured
about
three
pounds
of
it.”
i
might
say
for
purposes
of
illustration
that
i've
been
told
by
the
bureau
of
narcotics
that
the
average
medically
recommended
dose
of
methamphetamine
is
five
milligrams
according
to
the
u.s.
pharmacopeia.
the
average
illicit
dose
on
the
street
is
10
milligrams
which
means
that
each
gram
of
methamphetamine
will
produce
approximately
100
illicit
doses.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
453
grams
in
a
pound.
as
we
will
see
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
amount
of
methamphetamine
involved
in
this
case
would
be
enough
for
approximately
3,500
illicit
doses
and
perhaps
7,000
illicit
doses.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
methamphetamine
is
speed.
it’s
a
stimulant
drug.
the
prosecution
in
this
case
arises
under
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act.
that
act
is
now
been
superseded
by
the
1970
comprehensive
drug
abuse
and
control
act.
speed
remains
a
control
of
drug
under
the
new
statute
as
well.
the
agent
however
insisted
that
he
would
not
provide
any
of
this
important
ingredient
unless
and
until
the
three-man
partnership
whom
he
confronted
provided
him
with
both
the
sample
of
the
methamphetamine
they
had
already
manufactured,
and
also
showed
him
the
laboratory.
patrick
connolly
then
with
the
agent
left
mr.
russell’s
house,
brought
the
agent
to
his
own
home
where
he
showed
him
some
items
of
laboratory
equipment.
before
they
left
russell’s
house,
john
connolly
gave
the
agent
a
sample
which
he
said
“had
come
from
the
last
batch
that
had
been
manufactured.”
i
emphasize
that
at
no
time
did
richard
russell
in
whose
presence
that’s
all
occurred
attempt
to
dissociate
himself
from
the
enterprise.
pursuant
to
the
arrangement,
the
agent
return
to
russell’s
house
the
next,
december
8th,
but
was
told
by
russell
that
russell
and
patrick
connolly
had
been
unable
to
get
the
other
chemicals
necessary
to
manufacture
the
methamphetamine
because
they
had
arrived
too
late
at
the
chemical
supply
store
on
the
afternoon
of
the
8th.
now,
the
respondent’s
brief
indicates
that
the
record
shows
that
russell
and
patrick
connolly
had
tried
to
get
phenyl-2-propanone
and
had
it
had
been
refused
to
them.
i
believe
the
record
on
pages
17
and
18
shows
that
they
were
going
to
get
the
other
chemicals
and
simply
arrived
too
late
to
get
them.
in
any
event,
they
said
they
would
get
the
chemicals
the
following
day,
december
9th,
and
when
the
agent
return
to
mr.
russell’s
home,
the
home
of
the
respondent
on
the
afternoon
of
december
9th
waited
for
mr.
russell
and
mr.
connolly.
the
group
then
set
out
for
patrick
connolly’s
home
with
the
laboratory
was
located
and
after
patrick
connolly
and
richard
russell
began
the
chemical
process
by
adding
a
variety
of
other
chemicals
to
a
flask,
the
agent
then
upon
their
request
provided
them
with
a
bottle
of
100
grams
of
phenyl-2-propanone.
the
reaction
process
took
about
two
hours
according
to
the
agent’s
testimony
from
about
7:30
until
9:30.
after
that
began
the
separate
phase,
the
drying
and
crystallization
phase
which
was
done
on
a
hot
plate
with
the
ladies
home
hair
dryer.
at
about
12:40,
1/4
of
the
methamphetamine
had
been
dried;
that
is
after
the
beaker
or
flask
had
been
chemically
treated.
mr.
connolly
poured
the
liquid
into
four
separate
flasks
and
each
flask
was
then
dried
on
a
pyrex
baking
dish
separately.
so
at
12:40,
the
first
transfer
actually
took
place
and
that
was
approximately
10
grams
or
enough
for
about
a
thousand
doses,
illicit
doses.
agent
shapiro,
the
undercover
agent
left
the
connolly
home,
left
mr.
connolly
and
russell
there
and
unbeknown
to
them
secured
the
methamphetamine
that
it
been
given
in
his
office
in
seattle.
he
returned
the
next
morning
at
about
8
o’clock.
the
respondent
and
pat
connolly
where
still
there
drying
the
rest
of
the
speed.
after
russell
succeeded
in
scraping
off
the
remainder
or
the
crystalline
form
of
the
drug
into
three
more
bags
of
methamphetamine,
patrick
connolly
said
to
the
agent,
“you
may
have
the
rest
of
the
batch”
and
russell
according
to
the
testimony
interjected
after
i
get
my
half.
so,
the
agent
was
given
one
of
the
remaining
three
bags.
richard
russell,
the
respondent
took
the
other
two
bags.
the
agent
offered
to
buy
the
two
bags
for
cash
and
russell
said,
“that
he
already
made
arrangements
to
sell
one
of
those
bags
for
cash.”
in
the
course
of
the
drive
back
to
the
respondent's
home,
russell
agreed
to
sell
the
remaining
bag,
the
fourth
bag
to
the
undercover
agent
for
cash
and
at
his
home,
the
agent
paid
him
$60.00
and
purchased
approximately
9
1/2
grams
of
methamphetamine.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
same
agent
all
the
way
through.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
only
one
agent
involved
in
the
actual
transaction,
yes
sir.
about
three
weeks
later,
agent
shapiro
contacted
patrick
connolly
again
at
connolly’s
home
which
was
where
the
laboratory
was
located,
asked
him
if
he
was
still
interested
in
the
business
arrangement
and
connolly
replied
that
he
was
still
interested,
but
in
the
interim,
he
had
obtained
two
more
bottles
of
phenyl-2-propanone
which
was
the
commodity
of
the
agent
was
willing
to
supply
and
that
he
wouldn’t
be
finished
with
those
for
a
few
days.
a
few
days
later
along
with
the
search
warrant
and
an
arrest
warrant,
agent
shapiro
and
other
federal
agents
raided
mr.
connolly’s
home
laboratory
and
seized
over
a
100
items
that
were
admitted
at
the
trial,
included
were
chemical
supply
company
catalogs,
a
variety
of
chemicals,
laboratory
equipment,
and
three
bottles
of
phenyl-2-propanone.
one
was
the
100-gram
bottle
the
agent
had
supplied
and
which
he
was
able
identify.
his
second
empty
bottle
was
500-gram
bottle
labeled
to
p2p
which
chemical
analysis
showed
had
actually
contain
the
drug
and
the
third
bottle,
a
100-gram
bottle
of
p2p
was
still
half
full.
mr.
connelly
was
indicted
on
five
counts
involving
violations
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
mr.
russell
was
charged
with
three
violations;
manufacturing,
processing
and
compounding
as
one
count,
delivering
the
controlled
the
drug
at
the
time
the
first
transfer
had
taken
place,
and
the
third
count,
selling
a
control
of
drug
at
the
time
that
the
agent
purchased
the
final
bag
from
him.
now,
the
defense
at
the
trial
was
entrapment,
that
was
the
only
defense.
respondent,
however,
did
not
testify
of
patrick
connelly
did.
the
jury
found
him
guilty,
however,
on
all
counts.
mr.
connelly
in
his
testimony
admitted
having
told
the
agent
that
they
have
manufactured
at
least
three
pounds
of
it
before
the
agent
appeared
on
the
scene.
he
also
acknowledged
that
he
had
told
the
agent
that
he,
patrick,
handled
the
chemical
reaction
phase
of
the
business
that
his
brother
john
normally
did
the
drying
and
crystallization
phase
and
that
richard
russell,
the
respondent
here
took
care
of
the
sales
in
return
from
50%
of
the
profits.
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
standard
entrapment
instructions.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir,
he
didn’t
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination,
what
do
have
you
done?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
he
said,
he
may
have
picked
up
some
pieces
of
aluminum
foil,
aluminum
being
one
of
the
ingredients
after
they
have
fallen
to
floor
and
put
them
into
flask,
but
he
said
he
did
not
provide
any
other
resistance
and
he
did
not
advise
or
instruct
the
man
how
to
go
about
completing
the
reaction
or
in
any
other
way
not
assist
in
the
crystallization
either.
so
his
only
participation,
i
believe
this
is
agreed,
was
to
supply
the
100-grams
of
phenyl-2-propanone.
the
jury
under
the
standard
entrapment
instructions
which
focus
on
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
may
have
been
pre-disposed
to
commit
the
crime
before
the
undercover
agent
appeared
on
the
scene,
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdicts
of
guilty
on
all
counts
against
both
of
the
defendants
who
appeared
at
the
trial.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
they
are
on
page
17.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
the
first
two
paragraphs
were
contained
both
in
the
defendant’s
proposed
instructions
and
in
the
--
a
government’s
proposed
instructions.
they
are
for
the
standard
mathes
and
devitt.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
the
first
three
paragraphs
beginning
where
a
person
has
no
previews
intent
and
on
the
other
hand
where
a
person
already
has
the
willingness
and
readiness
to
break
the
law.
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
agent
provides
what
appears
to
be
a
favorable
opportunity
is
not
entrapment.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
the
objection
on
the
part
of
the
defense
at
trial
as
i
read
the
record
anyway
is
that
the
government
--
the
judge
did
not
sufficiently
defined
that
the
government
had
the
burden
of
showing
propensity
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
objections?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
not
in
the
appendix.
it
is
in
the
record,
however,
and
the
case
as
it
comes
to
this
court
does
not
rest
on
the
instructions.
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
instructions
correctly
stated
that
the
traditional
law
of
entrapment
and
i’ll
come
now
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
exactly.
the
court
of
appeals
took
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
right.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
specifically
provides
that
federal
and
state
agents
are
not
covered
by
the
normal
prohibitions
against
possession
or
dispensing
or
even
manufacturing
controlled
drug.
so,
nothing
that
the
agent
did
was
in
anyway
illegal
and
the
only
thing
that
he
did
was
deliver
one
of
the
ingredients
in
the
manufacture
of
the
drug.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
it
was
all
manufactured
from
the
same
ingredient.
as
i
say,
the
process
took
a
series
of
hours
at
about
he
arrived
in
the
evening
of
the
night
and
the
chemical
reaction
began
at
that
time.
shortly
after
midnight,
12:40
am
on
the
10th,
he
got
the
first
quarter
of
the
batch
which
had
been
dried
and
he
left
and
brought
that
to
his
office.
he
came
back
the
following
morning
and
russell
and
pat
connelly
were
still
working
on
the
remainder
of
the
methamphetamine
and
at
that
point,
the
agent
was
given
a
second
bag
and
purchased
the
third
bag
and
the
records
shows
that
the
respondent
would
up
with
the
fourth
bag.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
no.
there
was
delivered
to
the
agent
before
he
provided
them
with
any
phenyl-2-propanone,
a
sample
which
one
of
the
partnership
said
had
come
from
the
last
batch
they’d
manufactured.
then
after
the
batch
had
been
manufactured
with
the
ingredient
that
the
agent
supplied,
the
agent
returned
to
connelly’s
home
about
three
or
four
weeks
later
to
renew
the
business
arrangement
and
was
told
that
they
had
since
come
upon
a
new
source
of
phenyl-2-propanone
and
did
need
any
of
his
at
that
time.
but
all
of
the
methamphetamine
involved
in
this
prosecution
comes
from
a
chemical
reaction
which
included
the
phenyl-2-propanone
that
the
agent
provided.
that’s
the
posture
in
which
the
case
is
before
the
court.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
have
been
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
question
about
that.
the
evidence
of
the
subsequent
availability
of
phenyl-2-propanone
was
admitted
at
the
trial
because
it
showed
among
other
things
the
availability
of
this
ingredient
from
other
sources.
it
was
received
without
objection
i
believe.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no
sir.
the
basic
argument
in
the
instructions
was
over
who
had
the
burden
of
proving
propensity
or
lack
of
propensity
to
commit
the
crime.
after
the
trial
and
a
memorandum
for
a
new
trial,
the
respondent’s
counsel
argued
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
delivery
of
an
ingredient
and
the
manufacture
of
the
methamphetamine
constituted
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
was
the
position
ultimately
upheld
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case.
so,
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
on
a
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
on
what
are
essentially
undisputed
facts.
the
ninth
circuit
saying
that
the
standard
entrapment
standards
would
not
be
met
in
this
case
because
mr.
russell’s
predisposition
amply
shown
by
the
record
had
been
virtually
conceded
and
in
the
opinion
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
trask
(ph)
actually
quotes
the
portion
of
respondent’s
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
conceding
that
the
jury
could
find
under
the
standard
entrapment
defense
that
he
was
pre-disposed
to
the
offense.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
his
two
theories
in
a
nutshell
are
these.
first
of
all,
his
focus
is
generally
on
the
some
of
the
statements
made
in
the
separate
opinions
of
the
minority
in
the
sorrells
and
sherman
cases
which
are
of
course
the
two
leading
entrapment
cases.
in
those
opinions,
justices
roberts
and
frankfurter
said
that
the
entrapment
offense
really
ought
to
focus
not
on
the
subjective
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
or
on
his
predisposition
to
commit
the
crime,
but
rather
ought
to
focus
only
on
the
nature
of
the
officer’s
conduct
and
if
that
conduct
is
intolerable,
then
there
ought
to
be
a
bar
to
the
prosecution.
we’ll
show
in
a
few
moments
that
that
rationale
is
not
applicable
to
this
kind
of
case
anyway.
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
under
one
of
two
theories
of
the
defendant
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law
to
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
first,
they
said,
it
is
intolerable
government
conduct
to
supply
contraband
to
a
defendant
and
then
prosecute
him
for
possession
of
the
contraband.
now,
the
court
said
by
some
process
of
extension
that
even
though
the
phenyl-2-propanone
was
not
contraband
is
not
and
was
not
a
regulated
to
the
chemical,
nevertheless,
without
the
delivery
of
that
contraband
could’ve
been
made
and
therefore
what
happened
here
was
intolerable.
that
the
court
said
was
a
kind
of
extension
of
the
traditional
entrapment
doctrine.
alternatively,
the
ninth
circuit,
judge
elli’s
opinion
said,
there
is
a
separate
kind
of
due
process
defense
that
ought
to
be
recognized
where
the
government
engages
in
too
much
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
when
the
government
becomes
enmeshed
in
the
enterprise
for
a
reason
similar
to
the
reasons
that
support
the
entrapment
defense,
the
government
ought
to
be
precluded
from
prosecuting.
here,
the
court
said,
because
the
undercover
agent
had
supplied
one
of
the
ingredients
and
had
been
present
during
the
manufacture,
that
precluded
the
government
from
prosecuting.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
right,
that
--
i’d
like
to
approach
now
for
sorrells
and
sherman
to
say
why
under
either
of
the
views
presented
in
those
cases,
the
indictment
in
this
case
ought
to
be
reinstated.
the
--
both
parties
to
the
case
of
rather
or
extensively
quoted
from
all
of
the
opinions
in
those
two
cases
and
i
won’t
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
read
extensively
from
them
except
to
say
that
the
difference
in
philosophy
is
basic.
chief
justice
hughes’
opinion
in
sorrells
and
chief
justice
warren’s
opinion
in
sherman
say
basically
what
we’re
talking
about
is
a
defense
to
criminal
liability.
and
the
basic
issue
in
terms
of
normal
criminal
law
standards
of
culpability
is,
did
the
intent
with
which
the
defendant
did
the
physical
acts
that
in
apparent
violation
of
the
statute
arise
on
his
own
or
was
that
criminal
design
manufactured
by
the
government?
in
analogy
to
standard
insanity
or
duress
from
the
state
concept,
the
man
is
just
not
criminally
liable
or
culpable
if
the
government
manufactured
the
criminal
intent.
and
the
court
in
both
to
those
cases
said,
this
is
consistent
with
what
we
would
understand
the
congressional
intent
to
be,
and
both
chief
justices
said
congress
didn’t
want
its
criminal
statutes
enforced
against
people
who
did
not
intend
to
violate
them
until
the
government
came
along.
the
separate
opinions
of
justice
roberts
and
justice
frankfurter
put
a
wholly
different
cast
on
it
and
said,
the
focus
ought
to
be
on
whether
the
conduct
of
the
investigators
is
tolerable
or
not
irrespective
of
normal
guilt
or
innocence
under
criminal
law
principles.
but
even
those
separate
opinions
and
this
is
basic,
state
what
is
to
called
the
objective
test
rather
than
the
subjective
test
and
it
is
not
the
kind
of
this
rule
or
subjective
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
here
terming
the
conduct
intolerable
or
repugnant
or
excessive
for
overzealous.
the
standard
stated
by
justice
frankfurter
and
we
quote
the
language
on
page
19
of
our
main
brief
is
this,
this
test
he
says,
shifts
attention
from
the
record
and
predisposition
of
the
particular
defendant
to
the
conduct
of
the
police
and
the
likelihood
objectively
considered
that
it
would
entrap
only
those
ready
and
willing
to
commit
the
crime.
it
is
as
--
this
has
been
proposed
in
the
model
penal
code
and
the
proposed
federal
code
and
the
introduction
senate
one
in
the
93rd
congress
which
is
the
official
senate
bill,
mclellans,
senator
mclellans
bill
for
revamping
the
whole
criminal
--
federal
criminal
code,
the
test
would
be
an
objective
one.
is
it
likely
that
the
conduct
that
the
agent
engaged
in
might
seduce
an
innocent
person
into
committing
a
crime.
if
it’s
that
kind
of
conduct,
we
don’t
care
under
this
test
whether
the
defendant
actually
had
a
criminal
design.
we
just
won’t
allow
the
government
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
conduct.
if
however,
it's
conduct
that
would
not
likely
ensnared
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
looking
only
at
the
agent’s
conduct,
then
there
is
to
be
no
defense.
that’s
the
objective
standard.
now,
in
this
case
of
course
applying
that
standard,
there
can
be
no
question,
but
that
objectively
considered
and
offered
to
someone
to
supply
an
ingredient
in
the
manufacture
of
an
illegal
drug
is
not
likely
to
tempt
or
to
seduce
the
ordinary
law
abiding
citizen
about
whom
justice
frankfurter
was
speaking
as
well
into
committing
the
crime.
these
statements
by
justice
roberts
and
justice
frankfurter
came
up
in
the
context
of
cases
where
it
might
be
thought
that
a
normally
law
abiding
citizen
might
have
fallen
from
grace
because
of
the
over
bearing
of
the
government
agent.
in
sorrells,
it
was
a
request
to
get
some
liquor
during
prohibition
for
an
old
army
buddy
and
it
might
have
been
thought
that
normal
social
behavior
might
ultimately
cause
a
person,
a
normally
law
abiding
person
to
yield
and
supply
a
kind
of
liquor.
in
sherman
of
course,
the
undercover
informant
attempted
another
former
narcotics
addict
who
was
undergoing
treatment
with
him
to
get
him
heroine
for
his
personal
use
saying
that
he
couldn’t
suffer
the
pain
of
withdrawal
and
finally,
the
perspective
defendant
yielded.
those
are
holes
apart
from
the
kind
of
conduct
here,
which
presents
no
risk
in
the
frankfurter
formulation
or
the
formulation
of
model
penal
code,
the
federal,
proposed
federal
code
or
s-1,
creates
no
risk
that
the
government
conduct
will
ensnare
the
otherwise
innocent
or
tempt
the
normally
law
abiding
citizen
as
in
the
federal
--
proposed
federal
code.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
there
were
some
indications
in
the
record
that
he
was
a
rum
runner,
but
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
all
the
court
held
in
sorrells
was
that
if
you
--
if
the
jury
had
credited
the
defense
testimony
which
was
that
he
didn’t
deal
in
liquor
and
had
a
good
reputation
in
the
community,
they
might
have
entertained
a
reasonable
doubt
which
is
the
current
standard
about
whether
he
had
to
pre-disposition.
so,
in
sorrells
all
that
happened
was
the
case
was
sent
back
for
a
new
trial
because
the
trial
court
it
held
that
it
would
not
even
submit
the
entrapment
question
to
the
jury.
all
that
court
held
was
that
under
one
view
of
the
evidence,
there
might
have
been
entrapment.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i’ll
have
to
leave
to
the
court
of
the
analysis.
the
theory
is
what
we’re
concerned
about
here.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
[laughter
attempt]
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that’s
exactly
right,
but
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
refused
to
let
the
jury
consider
that.
he
had
not
given
any
entrapment
instruction.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
right.
he
--
what
he
said
and
we
quote
this
language,
the
record
in
this
case
would
permit
the
jury
to
infer
that
the
man
was
otherwise
industrious,
that’s
the
language
you’re
referring
to,
but
he
wasn’t
talking
that
as
proving.
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
the
question
whether
the
creation
of
this
new
kind
of
defense
is
even
an
appropriate
exercise
of
judicial
power.
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
neither
under
the
due
process
clause
nor
under
what
is
called
the
court’s
supervisory
power
over
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
has
the
court
ever
asserted
or
exercise
the
power
to
create
a
new
defense
to
criminal
liability.
now,
chief
justice
hughes
in
the
sorrells’
opinion
specifically
rejects
this
proposition,
saying
the
courts
have
no
power
once
a
valid
statute
applicable
according
to
its
construction
is
involved
and
the
executive
chooses
to
prosecute,
the
courts
have
no
power
to
create
a
new
defense
to
exonerate
the
defendant
which
would
be
the
effect
of
the
holding
in
this
case.
we’ve
argued
at
some
length
in
our
brief
that
whether
you
regard
this
as
an
extension
of
the
entrapment
case
or
as
a
proposal
to
establish
a
new
due
process
defense,
there’s
no
basis
for
doing
it.
now
first
of
all,
the
technique
here
given
one
of
the
ingredients
to
be
used
in
the
manufacture
of
the
drug
fits
within
the
traditional
law
enforcement
technique
which
has
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
as
recently
as
in
osborn
against
the
united
states
in
385
u.s.
and
that
is,
it
is
not
unlawful
entrapment
to
provide
the
opportunity
or
facility
for
commission
of
a
crime,
if
the
criminal
intent
which
is
the
underlying
premise
of
criminal
prosecution
inheres
in
the
defendant
before
the
agent
appears
on
the
scene.
similarly,
there’s
no
inherent,
unfairness
here
in
this
kind
of
activity
we
believe.
i
think
we’ve
shown
in
our
brief
that
there
are
countervailing
reasons
from
law
enforcement
purposes
for
infiltrating
criminal
groups,
not
only
drug
groups,
but
organized
crime,
smuggling
and
espionage
groups,
but
nothing
that
was
done
here
violated
any
specific
provision
of
the
constitution.
the
court
in
hoffa,
osborn
and
lewis
has
specifically
rejected
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
amendment
challenges
to
undercover
operations
and
in
hoffa
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
this
violates
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
as
inherently
unfair.
we
therefore
request
that
the
judgment
follow
should
be
reversed
and
the
indictment
reinstated.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
would
i
would
call
a
minimal
concession,
mr.
justice.
what
we’re
talking
about
there
is,
if
the
only
thing
that
translated
a
fantasy
into
a
crime
was
the
appearance
of
the
government
agent,
well
then,
it
might
be
said
that
there
couldn’t
been
a
crime,
but
for
the
government
agent.
for
example,
if
some
people
at
college
smoker
decided
that
they
would
like
to
loot
fort
knox
and
there
was
an
undercover
agent
present
and
he
stimulated
the
scheme
and
because
of
his
official
position,
got
the
keys
to
the
vault
and
had
all
the
guards
taken
away
and
have
the
search
lights
turn
off
and
the
men
walk
in
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
yes
sir.
the
--
what
i
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
are
practical
constraints
on
the
occasions
in
which
undercover
agents
become
involved
in
schemes.
they
don’t
apply
to
violent
crimes,
even
the
proposed
formulations
would
not
allow
even
in
entrapment
defense
where
badly
injury
is
threatened.
but
to
illustrate
mr.
justice
if
i
may,
the
--
what
i
would
to
call
our
basic
theory
is
that
if
the
government
provides
a
fungible
commodity,
there
is
no
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
would
be
phenyl-2-propanone
here
because
it
could
be
obtained
from
other
sources.
it
was
difficult
to
obtain,
it
would
even
apply
to
heroine
or
the
counterfeit
bills
because
if
the
agent
isn’t
there
infiltrating
the
scheme,
monitoring
it
by
his
presence
in
participation,
it’s
very
probable
under
the
realities
of
the
criminal
world
that
the
heroine
or
the
counterfeit
bills
or
the
p2p
in
this
case
or
the
gun
in
your
case
will
come
from
someone
else.
and
that
is
a
legitimate
law
enforcement
objective
to
stay
right
close
to
the
transaction,
including
cooperating
with
the
scheme
to
the
extent
necessary
in
order
to
track
it
all
the
way
to
the
conclusion,
to
find
out
all
of
the
participants
and
then
nip
it
before
it
goes
any
further.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes
sir,
the
--
patrick
connelly
had
apparently
600-gram
jars
of
p2p.
thank
you.
