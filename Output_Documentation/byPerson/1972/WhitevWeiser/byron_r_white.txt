well
mr.
black,
can
you
find
anything
in
there
that
indicates
that
any
degree
of
--
in
its
exactitude
would
be
against
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
within
the
state,
one
district
was
five
times
as
large
as
another?
say
there
was
a
state
with
two
districts
and
that
one
district
--
one
congressional
district
was
five
times
as
large
as
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
would
say
that
would
violate
that
provision
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
–
where
do
you
find
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
state
ought
to
be
free
to
vary
as
much
as
the
constitution
permits
states
to
vary
among
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know
that
in
actual
census
speaking,
these
is
as
much
of
a
justification
for
varying
from
what
--
from
absolute
equality
based
on
census
figures
is
inaccurate
as
they
are.
let’s
assume
they
are
inaccurate
either
10%
higher,
10%
lower.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn’t
much
for
an
argument
for
justifying
the
variation.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
growth
patterns
aren’t
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it’s
growth
down
like
a
lot
of
places
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right.
