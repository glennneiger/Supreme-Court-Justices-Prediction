justice
william

rehnquist
why
is
that
you
would
read
mahan
as
being
a
reaffirmation
of
kirkpatrick?
i
would
have
taken
if
that
no
party
in
mahan
had
any
occasion
to
challenge
kirkpatrick
and
therefore
there
was
no
occasion
to
deal
with
it
other
than
as
they
didn’t
see.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fischman,
i
gather
under
your
view,
you
would
reject
the
following
of
county
lines
and
you
would
reject
protection
of
incumbency
as
justifications
for
population
deviation.
do
you
concede
that
there
are
any
justifications
other
than
those
that
refer
population
disparity
it
this
and
congressional
districting?
