the
elections
mr.
black
were
held
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
s.b.1.
justice
potter
stewart
not
under
the
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
present
state
legislature
was
elected
under
s.b.1.?
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
it’s
simply
a
neutral
consideration?
what
if
it’s
consideration
that
the
court
might
decide
as
simply
no
business
to
this
court?
it’s
not
an
invidious
or
it’s
not
an
impermissible
or
illegitimate
consideration
but
it’s
not
one
maybe
that
we
should
say
necessarily
legitimately
justifies
any
further
deviation
than
might
otherwise
exist.
what
if
it’s
simply
neutral?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
couldn’t
it
be?
it’s
just
no
business
of
this
court.
neutral
from
that
point
of
view.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
we
can
all
agree,
everybody
would
agree
that
if
there
were
evidence
here,
racial
discrimination,
we
would
all
agree
that
that’s
wholly
illegitimate
for
rather
constitutional
business.
but
if
it
were
this
candidate
or
this
incumbency
preservation,
constituency
preservation,
what
if
the
court
should
just
decide,
that’s
no
business
of
ours
and
therefore
a
neutral
factor.
isn’t
that
within
the
realm
of
possibility?
certainly
it
could
be
neutral
from
the
point
of
view.
justice
potter
stewart
this
factor,
this
ingredient
wasn’t
in
kirkpatrick,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
a
legislature
that
considered
this?
so
long
as
it
otherwise
makes
the
test
of
article
i,
section
2.
what
is
there
that
makes
this
an
illegitimate
consideration?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
the
legislature
devised
this
plan
of
the
congressional
districting
and
that’s
what
i’m
talking
about.
what
is
there
in
the
united
states
constitution
and
any
provision,
article
i,
section
2
or
anywhere
else
that
prevents
a
state
legislature
in
providing
the
congressional
districts
for
the
state
to
give
consideration
to
the
preservation
of
incumbents
so
long
as
it
doesn’t
otherwise
violate
article
i,
section
2.
what
is
it
that
makes
this
an
illegitimate
consideration
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
this
motivation
to
preserve
incumbency
is
itself
violative
of
something
in
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
even
though
you
have
computerized,
perfect
equality
at
least
so
far
as
any
figures
you
could
use
as
a
benchmark
had
it
and
yet
if
you
could
show
racial
discrimination
it
would
--
it
could
still
be
a
highly
unconstitutional
scheme
of
congressional
districting,
couldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
is
it
your
claim
that
if
you
had
perfect
numerical
proportionalities
so
far
as
any
benchmark
you
could
find
that
this
would
be
a
suspect
scheme
if
you
could
show
that
it
was
motivated
by
a
desire
to
protect
incumbents?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn’t
say
it’s
not
a
justification
for
any
variation,
any
between
districts?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
just
not
good
enough
reason
to
vary
from
equality?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
following
county
lines
or
local
subdivision
lines?
justice
potter
stewart
will
that
justify
some
variation?
justice
potter
stewart
which
one
cut
the
most
lines
in
this
case?
plan
b
or
c?
justice
potter
stewart
plan
b
cut
more
county
lines
than
c
did?
justice
potter
stewart
and
c
was
adopted
by
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
c
had
more
variation
in
than
plan
b,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
was
the
justification
for
that,
for
plan
c
varying
more
than
plan
b
did?
was
it
the
desire
to
follow
county
lines?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
just
wasn’t
any
evidence
about
it.
no
explanation
on
why
plan
c
rather
than
b
was
adopted
even
if
you
are
going
to
throw
up
the
legislative
plan.
justice
potter
stewart
which
one
followed
the
incumbency
of
the
plans?
which
preserved
the
most
incumbents?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
how
about
between
--
justice
potter
stewart
plan
b
and
c?
justice
potter
stewart
your
client
instructed
both
b
and
c.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
ought
to
know
which
one
did
what
to
incumbents.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
really
were
neutral.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
not
true
that
plan
b
more
closely
resembled
in
shape
and
form
s.b.1.
than
plan
c
did?
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
it
had
less
variance
than
plan
c
on
a
population
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
you
defend
plan
c
here
over
and
above
your
own
plan
b?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
good
reason
you
say
can
be
only
a
demographic
reason,
i.e.
an
estimate,
a
valid
rational
supportable
estimate
of
growth
in
the
district
or
of
laws
of
population
in
the
district.
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
i
didn’t
get
the
last
point.
justice
potter
stewart
24
districts,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
mean
by
that
last
is
the
more
districts
that
are
above
the
average,
the
more
probably
that
will
be
below
the
average.
that’s
all
you’re
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
the
elections
mr.
black
were
held
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
s.b.1.
justice
potter
stewart
not
under
the
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
present

was
elected
under
s.b.1.?
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your

justice
potter
stewart
what

a
neutral
consideration?
what
