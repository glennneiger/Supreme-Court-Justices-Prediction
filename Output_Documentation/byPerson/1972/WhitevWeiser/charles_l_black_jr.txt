mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
not
unfitting
to
say
to
the
court
that
in
the
beginning
that
having
had
the
benefit
of
his
wise
counsel,
i
now
have
the
benefit
of
the
physical
presence
of
his
honor,
the
honorable
john
l.
hill,
attorney
general
of
texas
who
was
going
to
attend
some
court
today
at
the
table
with
me
because
it
transcend
an
importance
to
the
state
into
its
political
structure
of
this
case.
the
case
involves
the
constitutional
validity
of
senate
bill
one
passed
by
the
texas
legislature
in
1971
and
signed
the
law
by
the
governor
in
june
of
that
year
redistricting
the
state
of
connecticut
into
24
new
congressional
districts
in
consequence
of
the
april
1,
1970
census
as
against
the
objection
of
a
violation
of
article
i,
section
2
because
of
certain
population
discrepancies
amongst
the
districts.
these
discrepancies
may
be
described
as
follows.
the
average
percentage
of
discrepancy
amongst
all
districts
is
.745%,
the
highest
variation
is
2.43%
up
and
the
lowest
1.70%
percent
down
making
a
total
spread
of
approximately
4.1%
and
placing
the
smallest
and
the
largest
district
in
the
ratio
of
some
1
to
1.04.
appellees
filed
their
complaint
on
october
1971
assailing
this
plan
as
unconstitutional
and
tendering
to
the
court
as
one
of
the
remedial
possibilities,
a
plan
b
of
which
deferred
from
senate
bill
one,
that
a
state’s
plan
only
in
that
county
lines
as
substantially
only
on
that
county
lines
were
freely
cuts
on
18
more
county
lines
cut
and
virtually
a
zero
population
variations
thereby
attained
while
the
general
plan
of
the
legislatures
bill
was
followed.
evidence
in
the
course
was
taken
by
deposition
and
it
showed
the
following.
first,
it’s
conspicuously
and
pervasively
showed
a
deep
concern
of
the
state
legislators
in
the
maintenance
of
present
congressional
districts
of
--
that
is
to
say
prior
congressional
districts
and
something
like
the
same
form
in
the
preservation
of
the
seniority
accrued
to
the
texas
congressional
delegation
and
in
other
such
concerns
related
to
this
which
maybe
called
by
the
majority
of
term
of
incumbency
protection
which
we
taken
account
of
both
parties
to
the
relation
preferred
to
designate
as
a
protection
of
the
constituency-congressman
relationship.
there
is
uncontradicted,
unimpeached
and
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
concern
in
its
inception
and
its
implementation
had
no
partisan
or
ideological
bias
and
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
as
we
read
it
of
any
causal
connection
between
this
concern
and
any
of
the
variations
in
the
plan,
small
as
they
are
or
the
whole
setup.
now,
during
the
passage
of
senate
bill
one,
the
plan
we
are
defending
through
the
state
legislature,
another
bill
was
originated
in
and
passed
for
texas
house
of
representatives
which
showed
variations
of
2.5%
up
and
down
or
1.6%
in
excess
or
lower
than
those
and
the
bill
which
finally
passed
which
we
are
defending.
there
is
no
record,
nothing
in
this
record
at
least
as
to
the
average
deviations
in
that
bill.
there
is
evidence
that
the
motives
for
the
defeat
of
this
bill
in
conference
committee
were
various
and
only
partly
known
but
it
is
fair
to
say
that
they
undoubtedly
had
to
do
in
some
substantial
part
with
contest
in
congressional
aspirations
of
a
house
member
and
a
senate
member.
the
record
shows
that
certain
of
the
legislators
had
a
belief
that
they
were
operating
under
certain
percentage
leeway’s
at
a
certain
tolerance
was
afforded
to
them
by
the
constitutional
law
of
the
subject
whether
that
belief
was
right,
well
of
course
depend
on
the
outcome
of
this
case.
there
is
shown
by
the
record
an
unimpeachably
bona
fide
concern
with
the
preservation
of
county
lines.
the
best
evidence
for
this
concern
and
as
far
as
bona
fide
is
amount
of
the
plan
as
it
emerged
with
we
have
thoroughly
analyzed
in
our
reply
brief.
finally,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
we
can
find
in
this
plan
that
we
are
defending
of
any
bias
toward
any
section,
toward
any
type
of
sectional
interest,
toward
any
rural
or
city
interest,
industrial
or
labor
interest
of
anything
or
anything
of
the
sort.
with
respect
to
interest
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
it
is
completely
random
and
nothing
of
this
sort
has
been
brought
forth.
on
january
10th,
the
appellee
is
herein
filed
an
amended
complaint
in
which
in
addition
to
plan
b,
they
tended
to
the
court
as
another
alternative
for
remedy
a
plan
c
which
this
time
departed
very
widely
indeed
from
the
legislatures
plan
and
rather
radically
in
some
respects
redistricted
the
state.
on
january
21,
eleven
days
later,
a
trial
was
held
which
actually
by
agreement
consisted
only
of
arguments
since
all
the
evidence
have
been
taken
by
deposition
and
at
that
trial,
appellees’
counsel
six
times
recommended
the
adoption
of
their
plan
b.
the
one
which
followed
the
legislative
intent
as
closely
as
possible
by
reducing
variation
to
virtually
zero
and
plan
c
was
never
mentioned
by
anyone
except
one
judge
in
the
course
of
a
rather
colorless
enumeration
of
all
the
plans
before
the
court.
next
morning,
january
22,
1972
at
11
o’clock
in
the
morning,
the
court
reconvened
in
a
very
short
opinion
knocked
out
that
the
legislature’s
plan
for
districting
and
announced
that
plan
c,
the
radically
advisory
plan
was
to
be
and
i
quote
“the
plan
of
this
court
for
the
congressional
district
of
the
state
of
texas.”
the
court
left
open
the
possibility
of
a
state,
i
beg
the
court’s
pardon
of
an
action
--
a
new
action
by
the
legislature
but
the
legislature
--
the
governor
refused
to
call
the
special
session
so
that
possibility
was
not
a
real
one,
this
court
stayed
this
judgment
on
application
to
mr.
justice
powell
by
him
referred
to
the
court
at
about
the
end
of
january
1972
when
the
elections
last
year
were
held
under
this
state’s
plan.
during
the
proceeding
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
under
state
plan.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
under
s.b.1.,
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
no,
the
judgment
was
being
wholly
stayed,
there
was
no
injunction
against
s.b.1
and
it
was
there
for
used
by
the
secretary
of
state
as
who
is
the
appellant
herein.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
the
state
congressional
delegation
was
elected.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
yes,
the
intervention,
there
was
an
intervention
on
the
plaintiffs’
side
on
the
appellees’
side
by
the
chairman
of
the
bexar
county
republican
committee
and
others
and
they
have
filed
the
brief
herein
as
appellees
intervenors
but
it’s
believed
that
the
--
neither
the
intervention
or
the
--
nor
the
position
here
add
anything
significantly
one
way
or
another
to
the
issue
of
this
case.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
condemnation
of
so
tight
fitting,
a
plan
as
this,
with
variations
up
and
down
of
4.1%
must
rest
if
it
is
to
be
pronounced
on
the
strictest
rule
associated
where
the
case
of
kirkpatrick
against
preisler,
the
rule
are
very
strict
arithmetical
equality
as
to
congressional
district.
we
have
other
contentions
which
i
will
urge
but
our
--
with
our
contention
in
chief
here
to
this
court
is
that
we
ask
this
court
that
it
recede
generally
from
the
rule
attributing
constitutional
significance
to
variations
of
the
magnitude
of
that
found
in
this
case,
any
constitutional
significance
at
all.
we
have
to
start
of
course
with
the
recognition
that
mahan
against
powell
--
against
howell
seems
to
put
our
question
in
the
somewhat
different
frame
of
reference
today.
we
--
the
frame
of
reference
being
that
it
would
seem
of
a
distinction
between
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
inferential
rule
drawn
by
analogy
of
functional
equivalency
from
article
i,
section
2.
but
this
frame
of
reference
may
easily
be
more
misleading
that
helpful
as
to
this
question
because
the
principle
question
actually
is
still
just
the
same.
the
constitutional
law
of
congressional
districting
has
to
march
on
its
own
feet
if
there
had
never
been
a
state
legislative
districting
or
apportionment
case.
if
there
were
no
equal
protection
clause,
if
there
were
no
fourteenth
amendment,
the
dominant
question
in
this
case,
the
one
principally
interesting
in
this
court
would
still
be
--
can
it
rationally
be
held
by
analogy
or
functional
inference
from
article
i,
section
2
that
the
substantive
constitutional
law
of
congressional
districting
contains
a
requirement
of
exact
arithmetic
equality
of
district
populations
or
can
this
be
held
by
any
other
lawfully
warrantable
process
of
reason.
the
right
answer
to
this
question
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
a
--
to
infer
analogically
or
as
a
matter
of
functional
equivalency
from
a
plan
which
aims
at
a
rough
and
substantial
proportionality
of
representatives
to
constituencies
that
the
groups
which
make
up
of
the
delegations
or
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
well,
that
would
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
on
article
1
section
2,
that
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
that
would
your
honor
--
that
would
be
relatively
easy
i
think
because
there
is
no
variation
amongst
the
states
which
is
anything
like
that
great.
the
real
difficulty
is
reached
when
find
such
variations
as
an
ideal
districts
as
those
between
some
of
the
states
at
the
extreme
of
the
ideal
district
table
which
never
varied
about
more
than
200,000
or
so
and
at
that
point,
my
answer
would
be
that
there’s
no
mechanical
character
in
this
inference
that
the
federal
plan
aims
at
a
substantial
equality
and
that
the
state
dealt
congressional
delegation
ought
to
be
apportioned
by
analogy
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
is
the
meaning
of
my
statement
that
as
i
see
it
that
i
don’t
think
this
is
a
mechanical
inference
which
carries
over
the
exact
arithmetical
characteristics.
i
think
it’s
as
the
nature
of
the
federal
plan
as
a
plan
aiming
not
at
total,
not
at
exactly
forming
but
a
substantial
and
reasonably
quality
that
must
form
the
first
term
and
inn
analogical
inference
to
any
rule
having
to
do
with
the
formation
of
the
states
congressional
delegation.
what
is
substantially
reasonable
maybe
a
different
matter
within
a
state
from
what
it
is
on
the
national
scale
but
it’s
--
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
there’s
simply
no
warrant
whatever
for
the
use
of
a
--
of
the
federal
scheme
permitting
without
feeling
of
wrong
or
policy,
the
variations
which
it
does
as
the
first
term
in
an
analogy
which
terminates
into
judgment
--
that
zero
variation
is
somehow
the
rule
in
state
delegations.
now,
we
have
to
recognize
of
course
realistically
at
this
time
and
at
this
hour
that
there
are
certain
expressions
in
the
certain
strong
expressions
and
the
reasonably
decided
case
of
mahan
against
howell
which
seem
to
assume
vitality
or
contending
vitality
in
the
kirkpatrick
rule
was
applied
to
congressional
districts.
but
it’s
never
too
late
for
the
right
answer
and
its
appellant’s
submission
herein
that
the
answer
in
the
negative
to
the
question
whether
this
inference
of
substantive
law
is
warrantable,
is
overwhelming
the
right
answer
for
two
reasons
which
i
will
canvass
so
either
one
is
sufficient
alone,
and
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
there
never
will
be
a
better
case
than
this.
for
this,
the
total
new
look
and
total
reconsideration
of
the
kirkpatrick
rule
of
exact
arithmetical
exactness.
first,
because
in
this
case
from
every
practical
point
of
view,
the
variations
attribute
a
4.1%
up
and
down.
secondly,
there
is
a
total
lack
of
any
evidence
or
any
suggestion
of
any
kind
of
bias
in
this
case
toward
any
sort
of
political
or
sectional
or
economic
interest.
and
finally
because
there’s
an
absolutely
clean,
unimpeachably
clean
approach
to
the
county
line
question,
to
the
question
of
the
integrity
of
counties.
now
in
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
really
in
the
sense
broken
into
the
first
of
our
points
which
is
simply
that
in
brief
though
at
this
matters
of
better
canvass
of
arithmetical
as
they
are
in
writing
and
in
extension
we
try
to
do
that
in
our
brief.
but
then
some,
the
federal
--
there
is
nothing
in
article
i,
section
2
on
an
inference
can
be
drawn
there
from
at
which
at
least
the
mind
rationally
to
a
requirement
of
exact
arithmetic
equality.
its
well
i
think
to
look
--
well,
first
i
looked
around
the
picture
out.
i
will
say
with
our
second
point
will
be
and
it’s
simply
that
there
are
easily
accessible
data.
mere
arithmetical
facts
which
it
were
pretentious
to
refer
to
as
demographic
which
put
it
entirely
out
of
doubt.
that
there
is
no
firm
correlation
whatever
for
multiple
reasons
at
the
low
percentage
range
between
very
small
variations
and
population
as
of
census
day
and
the
voting
power
of
people
who
either
do
vote
or
can
vote
at
the
times
and
places
when
they
do
vote
which
i
remind
the
court
commence
two-and-one-
half
years
after
the
census
day
of
april
1st
in
the
zero
numbered
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
your
honor
of
course
that
is
correct
and
perhaps
i
have
been
guilty
of
advocates
pessimism
but
they
did
seem
to
us
to
be
expressions
which
at
least
i
assume
that
kirkpatrick
was
for
the
moment
being
taken
as
a
fix
star
and
the
part
of
wisdom
for
us
therefore
is
directly
to
address
ourselves
to
that
point.
of
course
there
was
--
it
is
very
true
as
your
honor
says
that
there
was
nothing
more
at
issue
in
mahan
that
concern
of
contending
validity
of
the
rule
in
kirkpatrick
against
preisler.
now
the
relevance
of
the
last
point
to
substantive
law,
the
relevance
of
this
lack
of
correlation
subject
law
is
very
simple
and
thoroughly
pervading
of
the
whole
legal
framework.
good
law
never
commenced
futility
and
when
it
discovers
that
it’s
commended
the
futility
by
inadvertence,
it
hastens
to
retract
it.
we
think
that
it
can
be
shown
by
this
simple
arithmetical
means
that
the
command
of
exact
arithmetical
equality
is
a
futility
that
it
affects
nothing,
that
it
has
no
connection
of
any
kind
with
the
power
to
vote
at
the
times
and
places
when
people
actually
do
vote.
now
if
i
may
develop
these
points
just
a
little
more
deeply,
let
me
revert
as
one
does
revert
at
this
times
the
question
of
the
intent
of
those
who
put
into
place
article
i,
section
2,
again
this
is
a
matter
much
better
canvass
in
writing
and
with
extensive
references
but
i
think
that
we
happen
to
be
furnished
by
history
with
a
single
incident
which
if
unrebutted
and
it
is
not
rebutted
is
absolutely
conclusive
as
to
what
the
framers
of
the
constitution
would
thought
of
a
case
of
this
kind.
when
the
first
apportionment,
the
interim
apportionment
in
article
i,
section
2
was
constructed
by
a
committee
in
the
constitutional
convention
that
committee
had
before
it,
the
best
population
estimates
which
are
of
demography
not
yet
so
baptized
and
made
available
to
it.
at
the
time,
the
committee
came
back
to
the
whole
convention
with
the
plan
which
substantially
respected
the
population
figures
but
did
so
only
substantially
and
departed
from
what
they
would
have
indicated
considerably
more
widely
than
anything
in
this
case
or
at
any
case
remotely
like
it.
every
attempt
to
change
this
report
was
perfunctory
defeated
on
the
floor
of
the
convention
and
at
last
the
motion
was
made
to
ask
the
committee
to
state
its
reasons.
whereupon
this
practical
man
who
realize
that
such
reasons
are
multiple
that
they
differ
amongst
the
different
constituents
of
the
districting
body
and/or
the
apportioning
body
that
they
may
be
only
partly
articulable
proceeded
to
defeat
this
motion
10
to
1.
we
have
asked
in
our
brief
and
i
ask
again
with
respect.
is
it
so
much
as
possible
that
the
people
who
did
this
would
have
considered
the
variations
in
this
case?
4.1%
up
and
down
as
violative
of
the
constitution,
they
were
then
building
of
the
article
lay
within
writing
of
the
very
section
they
were
at
that
moment
drafting.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
find
it
any
elsewhere
to
rebut
this
inference.
now,
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
analogy
with
the
federal
plan
has
already
been
dealt
with
in
my
response
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
and
i
would
simply
say,
finally
that
on
this
point
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
derivation
of
the
congressional
districting
rule.
nothing
in
its
working,
nothing
in
its
history
to
make
it
more
exact
than
the
state
legislative
rule.
in
fact
the
connection
here
with
mahan
against
howell
is
simply
that
since
there
is
nothing
in
article
i,
section
2
or
anything
inferable
from
article
i,
section
2
affirmance
history
or
from
its
working
through
history
that
could
support
a
stricter
rule
than
the
rule
under
the
vague
mandate
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mahan
against
howell
in
it’s
holding
at
least
ought
to
afford
very
strong
collateral
support
to
us
though
indirect
that
at
this
stage
because
if
these
rules
are
the
same
then
they,
in
the
texture
with
which
they
end
up
at
the
end
of
that
derivation,
the
rules
mainly
of
the
equal
protect
clause
and
the
rule
derived
only
by
functional
analogy
from
article
i,
section
2
and
from
nowhere
else.
if
these
things
are
the
same,
then
if
there
was
room
for
the
accommodation
to
pragmatic
factors
in
mahan
against
howell,
surely,
there
should
be
room
for
accommodation
to
pragmatic
factors
in
a
congressional
case.
i
would
only
remind
the
court
that
the
tolerance
that
we
ask
for
in
this
case
is
exactly
as
it
happens
four
times
less
one-fourth
as
much
as
that
--
that
was
granted
in
mahan
against
howell.
now,
i
would
ask
the
court’s
indulgence
for
a
very
small
amount
of
arithmetic
at
this
time
and
then
completely
conclude
on
this
point.
the
case
is
--
this
is
a
bit
of
a
filling
out
of
my
assertion
that
that
is
a
futility
that
the
command
disagree
of
exactness.
the
cases
have
insisted
on
dilution
of
the
vote
as
the
rationale
for
the
portion
of
cases,
wesberry
against
sanders,
the
leading
congressional
cases
haughtily
saturated
with
this
concept
and
line
after
line,
paragraph
after
paragraph
that
occurs.
now
one
of
the
facts
of
the
correlation
between
the
raw
body
count
on
april
1,
1970
and
the
power
of
the
vote
in
congressional
districts
and
then
ensuing
twelve-and-a-half
years
beginning
two-and-a-half
years
later,
and
ending
twelve-and-a-half
years
later?
i
pass
over
briefly
the
census
count
problem
with
blacks
and
minorities,
the
minor
problems
such
as
alien
students,
prisoners
and
so
on
and
come
to
the
three
great
strategic
factors
which
totally
defeat
this
correlation.
first,
is
the
surprisingly
wide
variance
in
the
percentage
of
age
eligible
as
to
vote
as
amongst
the
congressional
districts
and
virtually
every
state
in
the
union.
the
second
is
the
very
wide
difference
in
growth
patterns
in
the
congressional
districts
in
any
large
state
in
the
union
or
even
any
middle
size
state
in
the
union
and
finally
and
as
a
clincher,
the
unpredictability
agreed
upon
the
whole
authorities
in
the
present
state
of
the
art
of
demography
of
these
growth
patterns
when
one
remembers
that
these
things
operate
sequentially
over
a
period
of
twelve-and-a-half
years
on
raw
body
count
as
an
indicator
of
voting
power.
and
when
one
remembers
that
the
projection,
what
the
sub-national
post-censual
projection
as
they
call
it,
which
one
would
be
asking
of
the
demographers
has
to
do
not
only
with
people
of
18
in
1970
but
with
people
who
are
8
in
1970
and
it
asks
them
to
say
how
many
people
18
years
old?
how
many
citizens
as
opposed
to
aliens?
how
many
non-prisoners
as
opposed
to
prisoners
that
would
be
in
a
district?
the
position
becomes
quiet
hopeless
and
i
think
we
have
to
stop
and
ask
at
this
point
what
it
is
that
these
cases
are
doing.
is
it
something
symbolic
or
something
that
has
to
do
really
and
truly
with
the
power
of
the
vote?
it
is
our
submission
that
if
the
latter
is
the
case
and
it
must
surely
be
the
case
then
this
arithmetic
which
may
have
a
trivial
sound
figures
often
do
a
sound
trivial
is
utterly
and
deadly
serious
and
that
these
problems
have
to
be
faced
before
another
case
is
decided.
with
respect
or
in
deference
in
which
the
raw
census
count
is
treated
as
though
it
really
did
accurately
indicate
the
power
of
the
vote.
as
to
the
age
eligible
population,
let
me
give
you
your
honors
an
example,
well
i’ll
give
to
the
whole
texas
range,
the
texas
districts
differing
by
4%
in
raw
population
have
age
eligible
population
from
324,000
to
264,000
with
no
correlation
whatever
to
speak
of
with
the
raw
population.
we’ve
done
a
table
that
ranges
the
districts
in
order
of
raw
population
as
of
april
1,
1970
and
i’ll
just
give
the
court
the
first
five.
the
first
largest,
second
largest,
third
largest
so
on
districts,
we
then
ranged
them
in
order
of
age-eligible
populations.
the
numbers
in
the
different
districts
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
are
as
follows:
318,000;
286,000;
295,000;
325,000;
297,000
but
the
message
is
made
a
little
more
intelligible
if
i
give
the
court
the
order
numbers.
these
districts
respectively
stand
in
the
following
order
and
remember
that
they
are
in
the
order
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
in
population.
the
third,
the
twentieth,
the
eighteenth,
the
first
and
the
sixteenth,
those
are
not
district
names,
those
are
numbers
in
which
the
first
five
districts
in
population
stand
when
they
are
arrange
in
an
order
of
age
eligible
population.
now
the
rest
of
the
table
for
texas
shows
the
same
thing
and
similar
tables
show
much
the
same
thing
from
other
states.
the
growth
pattern
problem
speaks
for
itself
when
one
considers
that
what
one
is
dealing
with
as
growth
patterns
of
twelve-and-a-half
years
projection
of
growth
patterns
applied
to
18
year
olds
and
up
and
to
all
these
other
factors
and
i
don’t
really
think
it’s
necessary
once
attention
is
gone
to
it
to
say
very
much
more
about
that.
i
would
simply
conclude
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
with
the
deepest
respect
mr.
justice
white,
it’s
not
upon
the
inaccuracy
of
the
census
figures
that
we
principally
rely
that
is
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief
a
probably
existing
but
relatively
minor
factor.
it
is
with
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
not
very
much.
it
wouldn’t
be
and
it’s
not
ours.
our
principal
arguments
are
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
growth,
i
should
respectfully
differ
when
one
considers
that
growth
patterns
up
and
down
in
texas.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
well
in
texas,
one
has
growth
both
up
and
down.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
so
that
the
--
when
one
superimposes
these
growth
patterns
only
in
part
predictable
on
the
age
eligible
population.
one
finds
simply
that
one
might
arbitrarily
select
census
population
though
it
--
with
respect,
i
shouldn’t
see
why
that
would
be
done
but
one
can’t
select
it
with
any
warrantable
hope
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
power
of
the
vote
at
the
times
when
people
actually
do
vote
because
of
the
lack
of
correlation
with
eligibility
to
vote
because
of
the
large
and
unpredictable
character
of
the
growth
patterns.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
i
--
with
respect
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
that
question
is
susceptible
of
a
categorical
answer.
i
think
it
would
take
more
study
than
a
single
case
ever
afford.
what
i
should
say
confidently
in
this
case
is
that
we
are
a
very
long
way
below
the
point
at
which
any
significance
as
to
voting
power
can
be
attributed
to
the
variation
in
population
which
are
shown.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
not
unfitting
to
say
to
the
court
that
in
the
beginning
that
having
had
the
benefit
of
his
wise
counsel,
i
now
have
the
benefit
of
the
physical
presence
of
his
honor,
the
honorable
john
l.
hill,
attorney
general
of
texas
who
was
going
to
attend
some
court
today
at
the
table
with
me
because
it
transcend
an
importance
to
the
state
into
its
political
structure
of
this
case.
the
case
involves
the
constitutional
validity
of
senate
bill
one
passed
by
the
texas
legislature
in
1971
and
signed
the
law
by
the
governor
in
june
of
that
year
redistricting
the
state
of
connecticut
into
24
new
congressional
districts
in
consequence
of
the
april
1,
1970
census
as
against
the
objection
of
a
violation
of
article
i,
section
2
because
of
certain
population
discrepancies
amongst
the
districts.
these
discrepancies
may
be
described
as
follows.
the
average
percentage
of
discrepancy
amongst
all
districts
is
.745%,
the
highest
variation
is
2.43%
up
and
the
lowest
1.70%
percent
down
making
a
total
spread
of
approximately
4.1%
and
placing
the
smallest
and
the
largest
district
in
the
ratio
of
some
1
to
1.04.
appellees
filed
their
complaint
on
october
1971
assailing
this
plan
as
unconstitutional
and
tendering
to
the
court
as
one
of
the
remedial
possibilities,
a
plan
b
of
which
deferred
from
senate
bill
one,
that
a
state’s
plan
only
in
that
county
lines
as
substantially
only
on
that
county
lines
were
freely
cuts
on
18
more
county
lines
cut
and
virtually
a
zero
population
variations
thereby
attained
while
the
general
plan
of
the
legislatures
bill
was
followed.
evidence
in
the
course
was
taken
by
deposition
and
it
showed
the
following.
first,
it’s
conspicuously
and
pervasively
showed
a
deep
concern
of
the
state
legislators
in
the
maintenance
of
present
congressional
districts
of
--
that
is
to
say
prior
congressional
districts
and
something
like
the
same
form
in
the
preservation
of
the
seniority
accrued
to
the
texas
congressional
delegation
and
in
other
such
concerns
related
to
this
which
maybe
called
by
the
majority
of
term
of
incumbency
protection
which
we
taken
account
of
both
parties
to
the
relation
preferred
to
designate
as
a
protection
of
the
constituency-congressman
relationship.
there
is
uncontradicted,
unimpeached
and
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
concern
in
its
inception
and
its
implementation
had
no
partisan
or
ideological
bias
and
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
as
we
read
it
of
any
causal
connection
between
this
concern
and
any
of
the
variations
in
the
plan,
small
as
they
are
or
the
whole
setup.
now,
during
the
passage
of
senate
bill
one,
the
plan
we
are
defending
through
the
state
legislature,
another
bill
was
originated
in
and
passed
for
texas
house
of
representatives
which
showed
variations
of
2.5%
up
and
down
or
1.6%
in
excess
or
lower
than
those
and
the
bill
which
finally
passed
which
we
are
defending.
there
is
no
record,
nothing
in
this
record
at
least
as
to
the
average
deviations
in
that
bill.
there
is
evidence
that
the
motives
for
the
defeat
of
this
bill
in
conference
committee
were
various
and
only
partly
known
but
it
is
fair
to
say
that
they
undoubtedly
had
to
do
in
some
substantial
part
with
contest
in
congressional
aspirations
of
a
house
member
and
a
senate
member.
the
record
shows
that
certain
of
the
legislators
had
a
belief
that
they
were
operating
under
certain
percentage
leeway’s
at
a
certain
tolerance
was
afforded
to
them
by
the
constitutional
law
of
the
subject
whether
that
belief
was
right,
well
of
course
depend
on
the
outcome
of
this
case.
there
is
shown
by
the
record
an
unimpeachably
bona
fide
concern
with
the
preservation
of
county
lines.
the
best
evidence
for
this
concern
and
as
far
as
bona
fide
is
amount
of
the
plan
as
it
emerged
with
we
have
thoroughly
analyzed
in
our
reply
brief.
finally,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
we
can
find
in
this
plan
that
we
are
defending
of
any
bias
toward
any
section,
toward
any
type
of
sectional
interest,
toward
any
rural
or
city
interest,
industrial
or
labor
interest
of
anything
or
anything
of
the
sort.
with
respect
to
interest
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
it
is
completely
random
and
nothing
of
this
sort
has
been
brought
forth.
on
january
10th,
the
appellee
is
herein
filed
an
amended
complaint
in
which
in
addition
to
plan
b,
they
tended
to
the
court
as
another
alternative
for
remedy
a
plan
c
which
this
time
departed
very
widely
indeed
from
the
legislatures
plan
and
rather
radically
in
some
respects
redistricted
the
state.
on
january
21,
eleven
days
later,
a
trial
was
held
which
actually
by
agreement
consisted
only
of
arguments
since
all
the
evidence
have
been
taken
by
deposition
and
at
that
trial,
appellees’
counsel
six
times
recommended
the
adoption
of
their
plan
b.
the
one
which
followed
the
legislative
intent
as
closely
as
possible
by
reducing
variation
to
virtually
zero
and
plan
c
was
never
mentioned
by
anyone
except
one
judge
in
the
course
of
a
rather
colorless
enumeration
of
all
the
plans
before
the
court.
next
morning,
january
22,
1972
at
11
o’clock
in
the
morning,
the
court
reconvened
in
a
very
short
opinion
knocked
out
that
the
legislature’s
plan
for
districting
and
announced
that
plan
c,
the
radically
advisory
plan
was
to
be
and
i
quote
“the
plan
of
this
court
for
the
congressional
district
of
the
state
of
texas.”
the
court
left
open
the
possibility
of
a
state,
i
beg
the
court’s
pardon
of
an
action
--
a
new
action
by
the
legislature
but
the
legislature
--
the
governor
refused
to
call
the
special
session
so
that
possibility
was
not
a
real
one,
this
court
stayed
this
judgment
on
application
to
mr.
justice
powell
by
him
referred
to
the
court
at
about
the
end
of
january
1972
when
the
elections
last
year
were
held
under
this
state’s
plan.
during
the
proceeding

yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles

no,
the
judgment
was
being
wholly
stayed,
there
was
no

against

and
it
was

the

mr.

yes,
the

there
was
an
intervention
on
the
plaintiffs’
side
on
the

side
by
the

of
the

republican
committee
and
others
and
they
have

neither
the
intervention
or
the
--
nor
the
position
here
add
anything
significantly
one
way
or
another
to
the
issue
of
this
case.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
condemnation
of
so
tight
fitting,
a
plan
as
this,
with
variations
up
and
down
of
4.1%
must
rest
if
it
is
to
be
pronounced
on
the
strictest
rule
associated
where
the
case
of
kirkpatrick
against
preisler,
the
rule
are
very
strict
arithmetical
equality
as
to
congressional
district.
we
have
other
contentions
which
i
will
urge
but
our
--
with
our
contention
in
chief
here
to
this
court
is
that
we
ask
this
court
that
it
recede
generally
from
the
rule
attributing
constitutional
significance
to
variations
of
the
magnitude
of
that
found
in
this
case,
any
constitutional
significance
at
all.
we
have
to
start
of
course
with
the
recognition
that
mahan
against
powell
--
against
howell
seems
to
put
our
question
in
the
somewhat
different
frame
of
reference
today.
we
--
the
frame
of
reference
being
that
it
would
seem
of
a
distinction
between
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
inferential
rule
drawn
by
analogy
of
functional
equivalency
from
article
i,
section
2.
but
this
frame
of
reference
may
easily
be
more
misleading
that
helpful
as
to
this
question
because
the
principle
question
actually
is
still
just
the
same.
the
constitutional
law
of
congressional
districting
has
to
march
on
its
own
feet
if
there
had
never
been
a
state
legislative
districting
or
apportionment
case.
if
there
were
no
equal
protection
clause,
if
there
were
no
fourteenth
amendment,
the
dominant
question
in
this
case,
the
one
principally
interesting
in
this
court
would
still
be
--
can
it
rationally
be
held
by
analogy
or
functional
inference
from
article
i,
section
2
that
the
substantive
constitutional
law
of
congressional
districting
contains
a
requirement
of
exact
arithmetic
equality
of
district
populations
or
can
this
be
held
by
any
other
lawfully
warrantable
process
of
reason.
the
right
answer
to
this
question
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
a
--
to
infer
analogically
or
as
a
matter
of
functional
equivalency
from
a
plan
which
aims
at
a
rough
and
substantial
proportionality
of
representatives
to
constituencies
that
the
groups
which
make
up
of
the
delegations
or
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
well,
that
would
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
on
article
1
section
2,
that
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
that
would
your
honor
--
that
would
be
relatively
easy
i
think
because
there
is
no
variation
amongst
the
states
which
is
anything
like
that
great.
the
real
difficulty
is
reached
when
find
such
variations
as
an
ideal
districts
as
those
between
some
of
the
states
at
the
extreme
of
the
ideal
district
table
which
never
varied
about
more
than
200,000
or
so
and
at
that
point,
my
answer
would
be
that
there’s
no
mechanical
character
in
this
inference
that
the
federal
plan
aims
at
a
substantial
equality
and
that
the
state
dealt
congressional
delegation
ought
to
be
apportioned
by
analogy
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
is
the
meaning
of
my
statement
that
as
i
see
it
that
i
don’t
think
this
is
a
mechanical
inference
which
carries
over
the
exact
arithmetical
characteristics.
i
think
it’s
as
the
nature
of
the
federal
plan
as
a
plan
aiming
not
at
total,
not
at
exactly
forming
but
a
substantial
and
reasonably
quality
that
must
form
the
first
term
and
inn
analogical
inference
to
any
rule
having
to
do
with
the
formation
of
the
states
congressional
delegation.
what
is
substantially
reasonable
maybe
a
different
matter
within
a
state
from
what
it
is
on
the
national
scale
but
it’s
--
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
there’s
simply
no
warrant
whatever
for
the
use
of
a
--
of
the
federal
scheme
permitting
without
feeling
of
wrong
or
policy,
the
variations
which
it
does
as
the
first
term
in
an
analogy
which
terminates
into
judgment
--
that
zero
variation
is
somehow
the
rule
in
state
delegations.
now,
we
have
to
recognize
of
course
realistically
at
this
time
and
at
this
hour
that
there
are
certain
expressions
in
the
certain
strong
expressions
and
the
reasonably
decided
case
of
mahan
against
howell
which
seem
to
assume
vitality
or
contending
vitality
in
the
kirkpatrick
rule
was
applied
to
congressional
districts.
but
it’s
never
too
late
for
the
right
answer
and
its
appellant’s
submission
herein
that
the
answer
in
the
negative
to
the
question
whether
this
inference
of
substantive
law
is
warrantable,
is
overwhelming
the
right
answer
for
two
reasons
which
i
will
canvass
so
either
one
is
sufficient
alone,
and
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
there
never
will
be
a
better
case
than
this.
for
this,
the
total
new
look
and
total
reconsideration
of
the
kirkpatrick
rule
of
exact
arithmetical
exactness.
first,
because
in
this
case
from
every
practical
point
of
view,
the
variations
attribute
a
4.1%
up
and
down.
secondly,
there
is
a
total
lack
of
any
evidence
or
any
suggestion
of
any
kind
of
bias
in
this
case
toward
any
sort
of
political
or
sectional
or
economic
interest.
and
finally
because
there’s
an
absolutely
clean,
unimpeachably
clean
approach
to
the
county
line
question,
to
the
question
of
the
integrity
of
counties.
now
in
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
really
in
the
sense
broken
into
the
first
of
our
points
which
is
simply
that
in
brief
though
at
this
matters
of
better
canvass
of
arithmetical
as
they
are
in
writing
and
in
extension
we
try
to
do
that
in
our
brief.
but
then
some,
the
federal
--
there
is
nothing
in
article
i,
section
2
on
an
inference
can
be
drawn
there
from
at
which
at
least
the
mind
rationally
to
a
requirement
of
exact
arithmetic
equality.
its
well
i
think
to
look
--
well,
first
i
looked
around
the
picture
out.
i
will
say
with
our
second
point
will
be
and
it’s
simply
that
there
are
easily
accessible
data.
mere
arithmetical
facts
which
it
were
pretentious
to
refer
to
as
demographic
which
put
it
entirely
out
of
doubt.
that
there
is
no
firm
correlation
whatever
for
multiple
reasons
at
the
low
percentage
range
between
very
small
variations
and
population
as
of
census
day
and
the
voting
power
of
people
who
either
do
vote
or
can
vote
at
the
times
and
places
when
they
do
vote
which
i
remind
the
court
commence
two-and-one-
half
years
after
the
census
day
of
april
1st
in
the
zero
numbered
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
your
honor
of
course
that
is
correct
and
perhaps
i
have
been
guilty
of
advocates
pessimism
but
they
did
seem
to
us
to
be
expressions
which
at
least
i
assume
that
kirkpatrick
was
for
the
moment
being
taken
as
a
fix
star
and
the
part
of
wisdom
for
us
therefore
is
directly
to
address
ourselves
to
that
point.
of
course
there
was
--
it
is
very
true
as
your
honor
says
that
there
was
nothing
more
at
issue
in
mahan
that
concern
of
contending
validity
of
the
rule
in
kirkpatrick
against
preisler.
now
the
relevance
of
the
last
point
to
substantive
law,
the
relevance
of
this
lack
of
correlation
subject
law
is
very
simple
and
thoroughly
pervading
of
the
whole
legal
framework.
good
law
never
commenced
futility
and
when
it
discovers
that
it’s
commended
the
futility
by
inadvertence,
it
hastens
to
retract
it.
we
think
that
it
can
be
shown
by
this
simple
arithmetical
means
that
the
command
of
exact
arithmetical
equality
is
a
futility
that
it
affects
nothing,
that
it
has
no
connection
of
any
kind
with
the
power
to
vote
at
the
times
and
places
when
people
actually
do
vote.
now
if
i
may
develop
these
points
just
a
little
more
deeply,
let
me
revert
as
one
does
revert
at
this
times
the
question
of
the
intent
of
those
who
put
into
place
article
i,
section
2,
again
this
is
a
matter
much
better
canvass
in
writing
and
with
extensive
references
but
i
think
that
we
happen
to
be
furnished
by
history
with
a
single
incident
which
if
unrebutted
and
it
is
not
rebutted
is
absolutely
conclusive
as
to
what
the
framers
of
the
constitution
would
thought
of
a
case
of
this
kind.
when
the
first
apportionment,
the
interim
apportionment
in
article
i,
section
2
was
constructed
by
a
committee
in
the
constitutional
convention
that
committee
had
before
it,
the
best
population
estimates
which
are
of
demography
not
yet
so
baptized
and
made
available
to
it.
at
the
time,
the
committee
came
back
to
the
whole
convention
with
the
plan
which
substantially
respected
the
population
figures
but
did
so
only
substantially
and
departed
from
what
they
would
have
indicated
considerably
more
widely
than
anything
in
this
case
or
at
any
case
remotely
like
it.
every
attempt
to
change
this
report
was
perfunctory
defeated
on
the
floor
of
the
convention
and
at
last
the
motion
was
made
to
ask
the
committee
to
state
its
reasons.
whereupon
this
practical
man
who
realize
that
such
reasons
are
multiple
that
they
differ
amongst
the
different
constituents
of
the
districting
body
and/or
the
apportioning
body
that
they
may
be
only
partly
articulable
proceeded
to
defeat
this
motion
10
to
1.
we
have
asked
in
our
brief
and
i
ask
again
with
respect.
is
it
so
much
as
possible
that
the
people
who
did
this
would
have
considered
the
variations
in
this
case?
4.1%
up
and
down
as
violative
of
the
constitution,
they
were
then
building
of
the
article
lay
within
writing
of
the
very
section
they
were
at
that
moment
drafting.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
find
it
any
elsewhere
to
rebut
this
inference.
now,
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
analogy
with
the
federal
plan
has
already
been
dealt
with
in
my
response
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
and
i
would
simply
say,
finally
that
on
this
point
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
derivation
of
the
congressional
districting
rule.
nothing
in
its
working,
nothing
in
its
history
to
make
it
more
exact
than
the
state
legislative
rule.
in
fact
the
connection
here
with
mahan
against
howell
is
simply
that
since
there
is
nothing
in
article
i,
section
2
or
anything
inferable
from
article
i,
section
2
affirmance
history
or
from
its
working
through
history
that
could
support
a
stricter
rule
than
the
rule
under
the
vague
mandate
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mahan
against
howell
in
it’s
holding
at
least
ought
to
afford
very
strong
collateral
support
to
us
though
indirect
that
at
this
stage
because
if
these
rules
are
the
same
then
they,
in
the
texture
with
which
they
end
up
at
the
end
of
that
derivation,
the
rules
mainly
of
the
equal
protect
clause
and
the
rule
derived
only
by
functional
analogy
from
article
i,
section
2
and
from
nowhere
else.
if
these
things
are
the
same,
then
if
there
was
room
for
the
accommodation
to
pragmatic
factors
in
mahan
against
howell,
surely,
there
should
be
room
for
accommodation
to
pragmatic
factors
in
a
congressional
case.
i
would
only
remind
the
court
that
the
tolerance
that
we
ask
for
in
this
case
is
exactly
as
it
happens
four
times
less
one-fourth
as
much
as
that
--
that
was
granted
in
mahan
against
howell.
now,
i
would
ask
the
court’s
indulgence
for
a
very
small
amount
of
arithmetic
at
this
time
and
then
completely
conclude
on
this
point.
the
case
is
--
this
is
a
bit
of
a
filling
out
of
my
assertion
that
that
is
a
futility
that
the
command
disagree
of
exactness.
the
cases
have
insisted
on
dilution
of
the
vote
as
the
rationale
for
the
portion
of
cases,
wesberry
against
sanders,
the
leading
congressional
cases
haughtily
saturated
with
this
concept
and
line
after
line,
paragraph
after
paragraph
that
occurs.
now
one
of
the
facts
of
the
correlation
between
the
raw
body
count
on
april
1,
1970
and
the
power
of
the
vote
in
congressional
districts
and
then
ensuing
twelve-and-a-half
years
beginning
two-and-a-half
years
later,
and
ending
twelve-and-a-half
years
later?
i
pass
over
briefly
the
census
count
problem
with
blacks
and
minorities,
the
minor
problems
such
as
alien
students,
prisoners
and
so
on
and
come
to
the
three
great
strategic
factors
which
totally
defeat
this
correlation.
first,
is
the
surprisingly
wide
variance
in
the
percentage
of
age
eligible
as
to
vote
as
amongst
the
congressional
districts
and
virtually
every
state
in
the
union.
the
second
is
the
very
wide
difference
in
growth
patterns
in
the
congressional
districts
in
any
large
state
in
the
union
or
even
any
middle
size
state
in
the
union
and
finally
and
as
a
clincher,
the
unpredictability
agreed
upon
the
whole
authorities
in
the
present
state
of
the
art
of
demography
of
these
growth
patterns
when
one
remembers
that
these
things
operate
sequentially
over
a
period
of
twelve-and-a-half
years
on
raw
body
count
as
an
indicator
of
voting
power.
and
when
one
remembers
that
the
projection,
what
the
sub-national
post-censual
projection
as
they
call
it,
which
one
would
be
asking
of
the
demographers
has
to
do
not
only
with
people
of
18
in
1970
but
with
people
who
are
8
in
1970
and
it
asks
them
to
say
how
many
people
18
years
old?
how
many
citizens
as
opposed
to
aliens?
how
many
non-prisoners
as
opposed
to
prisoners
that
would
be
in
a
district?
the
position
becomes
quiet
hopeless
and
i
think
we
have
to
stop
and
ask
at
this
point
what
it
is
that
these
cases
are
doing.
is
it
something
symbolic
or
something
that
has
to
do
really
and
truly
with
the
power
of
the
vote?
it
is
our
submission
that
if
the
latter
is
the
case
and
it
must
surely
be
the
case
then
this
arithmetic
which
may
have
a
trivial
sound
figures
often
do
a
sound
trivial
is
utterly
and
deadly
serious
and
that
these
problems
have
to
be
faced
before
another
case
is
decided.
with
respect
or
in
deference
in
which
the
raw
census
count
is
treated
as
though
it
really
did
accurately
indicate
the
power
of
the
vote.
as
to
the
age
eligible
population,
let
me
give
you
your
honors
an
example,
well
i’ll
give
to
the
whole
texas
range,
the
texas
districts
differing
by
4%
in
raw
population
have
age
eligible
population
from
324,000
to
264,000
with
no
correlation
whatever
to
speak
of
with
the
raw
population.
we’ve
done
a
table
that
ranges
the
districts
in
order
of
raw
population
as
of
april
1,
1970
and
i’ll
just
give
the
court
the
first
five.
the
first
largest,
second
largest,
third
largest
so
on
districts,
we
then
ranged
them
in
order
of
age-eligible
populations.
the
numbers
in
the
different
districts
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
are
as
follows:
318,000;
286,000;
295,000;
325,000;
297,000
but
the
message
is
made
a
little
more
intelligible
if
i
give
the
court
the
order
numbers.
these
districts
respectively
stand
in
the
following
order
and
remember
that
they
are
in
the
order
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
in
population.
the
third,
the
twentieth,
the
eighteenth,
the
first
and
the
sixteenth,
those
are
not
district
names,
those
are
numbers
in
which
the
first
five
districts
in
population
stand
when
they
are
arrange
in
an
order
of
age
eligible
population.
now
the
rest
of
the
table
for
texas
shows
the
same
thing
and
similar
tables
show
much
the
same
thing
from
other
states.
the
growth
pattern
problem
speaks
for
itself
when
one
considers
that
what
one
is
dealing
with

growth
patterns
of
twelve-and-a-half
years
projection
of
growth
patterns
applied
to
18
year
olds
and
up
and
to
all
these
other
factors
and
i
don’t
really
think
it’s
necessary
once
attention
is
gone
to
it
to
say
very
much
more
about
that.
i
would
simply
conclude
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
with
the
deepest
respect
mr.
justice
white,
it’s
not
upon
the
inaccuracy
of
the
census
figures
that
we
principally
rely
that
is
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief
a
probably
existing
but
relatively
minor
factor.
it
is
with
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
not
very
much.
it
wouldn’t
be
and
it’s
not
ours.
our
principal
arguments
are
--
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
growth,
i
should
respectfully
differ
when
one
considers
that
growth
patterns
up
and
down
in
texas.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
well
in
texas,
one
has
growth
both
up
and
down.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
so
that
the
--
when
one
superimposes
these
growth
patterns
only
in
part
predictable
on
the
age
eligible
population.
one
finds
simply
that
one
might
arbitrarily
select
census
population
though
it
--
with
respect,
i
shouldn’t
see
why
that
would
be
done
but
one
can’t
select
it
with
any
warrantable
hope
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
power
of
the
vote
at
the
times
when
people
actually
do
vote
because
of
the
lack
of
correlation
with
eligibility
to
vote
because
of
the
large
and
unpredictable
character
of
the
growth
patterns.
mr.
charles
l.
black,
jr.
i
--
with
respect
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
that
question
is
susceptible
of
a
categorical
answer.
i
think
it
would
take
more
study
than
a
single
case
ever
afford.
what
i
should
say
confidently
in
this
case
is
that
we
are
a
very
long
way
below
the
point
at
which
any
significance
as
to
voting
power
can
be
attributed
to
the
variation
in
population
which
are
shown.
i
thank
the
court.
