mr.
lawrence
fischman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
if
the
court
please
to
the
first
of
the
appellant’s
arguments
that
is
whether
the
rule
laid
down
in
kirkpatrick
versus
preisler
should
be
retreated
from.
secondly,
i
will
address
myself
to
whether
if
that
not
be
the
case,
the
record
in
this
case
brings
a
case
before
the
court
that
follows
within
the
kirkpatrick
rule
and
thirdly,
i’ll
say
a
word
about
the
remedy
which
was
fashioned
by
the
court
below
in
which
is
an
issue
here
today.
the
grounds
urged
by
appellants,
may
it
please
the
court
in
support
of
its
position
that
kirkpatrick
ought
to
be
retreated
from
our
fourfold.
first
that
kirkpatrick
is
not
supported
by
the
cases
relied
on
in
that
decision.
kirkpatrick
as
i
recall
cited
wesberry
versus
sanders
and
reynolds
versus
sims.
these
cases
where
the
wesberry
of
course
being
the
first
congressional
case
in
this
recent
line
and
reynolds
being
the
major
if
we
may
use
that
term
with
respect
to
any
one
case
decision
with
respect
to
legislative.
from
those
cases,
was
fashioned
the
rule
enunciated
in
kirkpatrick,
we
think
that
the
state
must
make
a
good
faith
effort.
the
emphasis
being
on
the
effort
to
achieve
absolutely
quality
not
that
equality
be
achieve.
if
the
recent
mahan
decision
stands
for
anything,
i
think
it’s
possibly
a
reaffirmation
of
that
principle.
and
we
certainly
don’t
rely
on
that
decision
since
it
was
not
a
congressional
case.
but
as
we
see,
the
plain
wording
of
the
constitution
requires
that
people
of
the
state
elect
the
members
of
the
united
states
house
of
representatives,
not
the
texas
legislature.
if
--
where
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
permit
the
legislatures
to
elect
the
representatives,
certainly
it
could
have
done
so
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
united
states
senators.
the
cleavage
between
the
two
houses,
the
great
compromise
very
clearly
articulated
in
the
wesberry
opinion
but
the
point
that
we
wish
to
emphasize
is
this.
we
are
here
today
because
the
state
of
texas
did
not
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
absolute
equality
not
so
much
that
equality
was
not
achieved.
the
second
reasons
advanced
by
the
appellant
are
the
--
i
believe
they
refer
to
the
kirkpatrick
decision
as
a
draconian
rule
or
procrustean
rule
and
suggest
that
it
is
a
rule
of
absolutism.
i
think
this
is
an
incorrect
reading.
they
asked
the
court
to
make
allowance
for
reasonable
legislative
interplay.
this
proposition
was
of
course
expressly
rejected
in
kirkpatrick.
we
suggest
on
very
sound
reasons.
it
leaves
the
door
open
first
of
all
to
gerrymandering
under
whatever
reason
that
the
legislature
might
have.
and
most
importantly,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
this
proposition
presumes
that
the
legislature
is
unable
to
act
in
good
faith.
we
submit
that
the
function
of
the
legislature
in
congressional
redistricting
cases
is
to
act
impartially
to
apportion
the
congressional
seats
among
the
population
considering
only
factors
of
population
and
nothing
else.
we’re
willing
to
say
that
the
legislature
can
make
that
good
faith
effort
and
we
feel
it
to
presume
otherwise,
is
not
only
a
gratuitous
insult
to
the
legislature
but
to
the
people
that
elected
him
as
well.
i
think
a
moments
time
should
be
devoted
to
the
argument
that
because
census
data
is
inaccurate,
it
cannot
be
that
constitution
requires
a
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
absolute
equality.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i
think
not
in
the
--
not
in
classical
sense
of
trying
to
“divine
intent”
for
example
in
a
criminal
case.
i
don’t
think
and
had
never
suggested
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
is
said
out
with
bad
faith
intent
to
deprive
the
people
of
the
state
of
texas
or
certain
portion
thereof
of
the
full
weight
of
their
bone
in
electing
congressional
representatives.
when
we
talk
about
intent,
we
must
consider
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
justifications
that
the
state
relies
on.
how
did
we
get
the
bill
with
4.1
deviation
top
to
bottom?
we
got
it
for
two
reasons
primarily.
number
one,
the
desire
to
preserve
incumbents,
now
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
this
is
a
legitimate
consideration,
then
the
court
should
and
expressly
say
so
and
would
necessarily
reverse
this
case
but
we
think
it’s
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i
don’t
think
it
can
never
be
neutral.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
well
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
is
to
stand,
we
think
that
this
is
an
element
of
the
equation
in
determining
good
faith
effort.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
no.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
it’s
not.
it’s
been
before
the
court
twice
in
clark
versus
williams
and
in
taylor
versus
mckeithen
but
in
neither
case
did
the
court
reach
those
questions.
they
were
there
on
procedural
matters.
the
district
courts
i
might
add
in
both
of
those
cases
squarely
rejected
this
consideration
and
we
think
on
extremely
legitimate
grounds.
no
congress
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
mr.
justice,
the
members
of
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
are
to
be
elected
by
the
people
and
not
by
the
legislatures.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
well,
i
can’t
follow
the
premise
because,
i
can’t
--
i’m
not
prepared
to
say
that
consideration
of
preserving
incumbents
is
not
otherwise
violative
or
article
i,
section
2.
it’s
our
reading
of
article
i,
section
2
which
we
think
is
consistent
with
wesberry
that
by
the
people
means
by
the
people.
this
is
the
whole
basis
for
the
language
if
we
are
to
take
the
opinion
in
wesberry
as
being
authoritative
on
the
constitutional
history
that
led
to
this.
the
great
compromise
was
that
in
one
branch
of
united
states
legislature,
the
states
were
to
be
represented
and
then
the
other,
the
people.
this
is
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give.
there
are
no
expressed
wordings
of
course
that
preservation
of
incumbents
is
not
prohibited.
but
we
think
that
it
flies
in
the
teeth
of
the
great
compromise
of
article
i,
section
2
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
insofar
as
it
negates,
the
good
faith
effort
that
we
believe
article
i,
section
2
requires.
we
believe
that
article
i,
section
2
requires
there’ll
be
no
considerations
other
than
population
as
overlaid
by
demographics.
we
think
that
kirkpatrick
left
open
for
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
it
could
under
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
oh!
i
wish
i
could
say
that
but
i
don’t
think
i
can.
it
is
our
belief
that
where
the
desire
to
protect
incumbents
subordinates
the
legitimate
considerations
of
population
then
it
rises
to
the
magnitude
of
the
constitutional
violation.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
and
we
believe
not.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i
cannot
think
of
any
justification
to
support
it.
no
congressman
has
the
best
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
no,
i
don’t.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i’m
inclined
to
say
not
in
the
congressional
case.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
plan
b,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
it
was
approximately
three
times
as
great
if
the
amount
involved
is
significant.
plan
b
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
we
have
nothing
in
the
court’s
opinion
other
than
the
statement
that
plan
c
most
closely
effectuates
the
principle
of
one
man,
one
vote.
we
don’t
know
and
i
wouldn’t
presume
or
speculate
on
why
plan
c
was
adopted.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
there
was
nothing
in
the
court’s
opinion.
the
plan
was
before
the
court
for
some
period
of
time,
there’s
some
pleading
of
course
to
support
the
plan
but
the
court
had
comparison
of
the
--
all
three
plans
both
in
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
that
would
be
the
plan
that
the
court
declared
unconstitutional,
s.b.1.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
plan
b
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
and
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
in
all
kinder,
i
do
not.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
i
was.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
it
did.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
only
on
the
basis
that
this
is
what
the
court
imposed.
i
think
the
only
difference
was,
that
plan
c
was
represented
to
the
court
to
be
based
solely
on
population
and
no
other
factor
at
one
time
in
their
pleadings
to
this
effect
there
was
discussion
about
considering
social
and
cultural
and
economic
ties,
community
of
interest
in
this
sort
of
thing.
this
was
some
of
the
discussion
that
appears
in
the
record
among
the
legislators
that
were
concerned
drafting
the
bill.
plan
c
took
none
of
these
at
least
we
are
so
represented
into
account
and
is
based
solely
on
population,
there
was
no
--
as
i
understand
it
regard
for
county
lines
or
at
most
a
minimal
regard.
the
sole
test
was
population.
and
if
i
had
to
speculate
on
what
the
court
below
thought,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
probably
the
basic
reason
that
plan
c
was
adopted.
i
did
wish
to
emphasize
i
think
appropriately
at
this
point
that
plan
c
was
adopted
by
the
court
conditionally.
the
way
it
was
left
wide
open
for
the
legislature
to
hold
the
special
session,
the
legislature
in
point
or
fact
is
in
session
at
this
time,
approximately
one-third
of
the
legislative
session
is
over
so
far
not
a
word
about
a
congressional
redistricting
bill.
there’s
--
whatever
arguments
there
may
be
for
the
fact
that
the
governor
didn’t
call
a
special
session,
there
are
none
now.
the
legislature
is
free
to
adopt
any
plan
including
plan
b.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i
do,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
are
demographic
arguments
only.
i
think
it
is
certainly
legitimate
for
the
legislature
to
consider
documented
or
is
best
that
the
signs
and
demography
can
document
patterns
of
growth
or
declined
population.
i
think
it
is
--
i
don’t
--
it
will
be
a
boarder
line
situation
to
consider
voting
population
but
certainly
allowance
is
for
demographics
as
suggested
in
kirkpatrick
or
certainly
valid
considerations
but
they
are
neutral
so
long
as
they
are
done
in
a
systematic
way
based
on
as
a
reliable
data
as
is
available
and
not
with
the
intention
of
discriminating
and
not
as
an
afterthought
to
justify
what
has
been
done
for
other
motivations,
protection
of
incumbents,
creating
a
safe
seat
for
one
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
to
run
for
congress.
these
considerations
are
singularly
inappropriate
and
any
other
justification
cannot
be
used
as
a
cover-up
as
it
were.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
our
argument
if
the
court
please
was
we
did
emphasize
that
plan
b
should
be
adopted.
i
would
say
in
defense
to
that
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
we
filed
an
amended
complaint
offering
both
plans
b
and
c.
i
cannot
answer
that
question
mr.
justice
inside
the
record.
but
outside
the
record,
i
thought
it
would
be
appropriate
not
only
to
have
a
plan
with
the
population
disparity
earned
out
as
plan
b
and
to
follow
as
closely
as
possible
what
the
legislature
had
done.
but
i
also
thought
that
we
ought
to
tear
everything
up
and
start
from
scratch
and
i
have
to
admit
to
be
the
imminence
per
se
behind
plan
c
but
it
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record.
but
as
far
as
the
effect
politically
i
have
to
say
in
complete
candid
before
this
court,
i
had
no
idea.
i
would
like
to
discuss
for
a
moment
what
alternatives
there
are
in
the
consideration,
what
the
appropriate
constitutional
test
is.
the
appellants
suggest
that
perhaps
some
sort
of
leeway
ought
to
be
allowed.
they
don’t
argue
that
it
ought
to
be
the
same
leeway
percentagwise
as
between
states.
this
notion
of
course
was
expressly
rejected
in
kirkpatrick.
the
reason
set
forth
in
kirkpatrick
i
think
much
better
answer
that
argument
and
i
can.
we
have
seen
a
very
practical
result
of
this
allowance
of
the
toleration.
this
is
what
the
legislature
is
aimed
for.
we
have
testimony
among
the
people
that
were
moving
forces
behind
these
bills
that
protection
or
that
they
were
allowed
a
toleration
of
between
four
and
10%
and
as
long
as
they
got
within
some
said
4%,
some
said
within
10%,
everything
would
be
alright.
as
one
of
the
witnesses
put
it,
their
desire
was
to
protect
the
incumbents
and
then
make
it
fit
to
numbers
within
5%.
this
is
precisely
a
devise
that
the
court
foresaw
in
kirkpatrick
and
a
very
cogent
reason
for
not
adopting
any
sort
of
de
minimus
standard
by
whatever
name
you
call
it.
it
is
no
more
than
a
de
minimus
standard
to
allow
this
sort
of
toleration.
the
goal
should
be
absolutely
quality.
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
reached
if
there’s
good
reason
for
it
not
to
have
been.
this
is
all
the
constitution
requires
in
our
view.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
that
is
our
view
mr.
justice.
i
think
we
can
find
it
in
the
record
in
this
case.
it
might
be
better
to
say
our
view
is
a
negative
one
of
what
a
good
faith
effort
is
not.
it
is
not
preservation
of
incumbents,
it
is
not
snarling
up
the
legislature
into
a
special
session
to
decide
whether
senator
wilson
will
occupy
congressman
douds’
to
be
vacant
sit
or
whether
representative
heinz
will
have
that
privilege.
and
this
is
what
the
final
map
was
a
product
of.
and
the
reason
and
this
is
well
supported
in
the
record
that
the
lower
bill
adopted
by
the
house
twice
and
sent
to
the
conference
committee
or
sent
to
the
senate
and
end
it
up
in
the
conference
committee
was
not
adopted
because
in
that
bill,
the
home
county
of
representative
or
of
senator
wilson,
angelina
county
was
excluded
from
the
second
district
and
representative
heinz
home
county
was
in
it.
the
final
bill
that
came
out
was
just
the
opposite
way
around.
and
we
must
also
consider
the
fact
that
the
shape
in
one
district
must
necessarily
reflect
the
shape
of
the
others.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
the
shape
of
one
district
must
necessarily
reflect
the
shape
of
others
and
when
i
say
shape,
i
don’t
mean
just
the
geographical
shape;
i
mean
the
number
of
people.
because
you
only
got
so
many
--
you
got
11
million
people
to
work
with,
you
so
many
in
one
district.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
your
honor.
these
were
the
considerations
of
the
legislature.
and
neither
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
mr.
justice
yes.
i
should
talk
for
a
moment
about
the
county
line
argument.
the
court
we
think
in
kirkpatrick
expressly
and
finally
rejected
the
argument
of
the
preservation
of
county
lines
is
a
legitimate
consideration
in
congressional
redistricting.
the
appellants
suggest
that
it
was
rejected
because
it
was
a
sham.
we
find
those
such
language
in
the
opinion
of
this
court.
in
mahan
recently
decided,
the
court
held
as
we
understand
it
that
in
legislative
--
state
legislative
redistricting,
this
was
a
legitimate
consideration
because
the
county
governments
where
in
any
instance
is
functionaries
of
the
state
that
there
was
in
the
case
of
virginia,
there
was
local
legislation
that
affected
counties
only.
we
find
no
such
considerations
or
at
least
not
of
such
a
pervasive
nature
in
congressional
redistricting
as
would
allow
for
any
substantial
variations
based
on
preservation
of
county
lines.
but
the
basic
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
with
the
county
line
argument
is
that
we
don’t
think
it
was
done
on
a
consistent
systematic
basis.
county
lines
were
cut
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
were
necessary.
i
will
retreat
from
the
term
expedient
where
it
was
necessary
to
do
so.
we
have
little
midland
county
with
the
population
of
60.
not
midland
county,
ector
county
with
the
city
of
odessa
is
located
with
a
population
less
than
a
100,000
people
which
cut
in
half
right
through
the
city
of
odessa.
under
s.b.1.,
we
have
instances
in
bexar
county
in
particular
where
largely
rural
districts
intrude
into
bexar
county.
it
point
first
in
the
23rd
districts
whereas
under
plan
c,
i
believe
bexar
county
would
probably
undoubtedly
deal
with
elect
to
congressman.
the
most
blaring
example
is
in
the
sixth
district
which
affects
my
home
county
of
dallas.
the
sixth
district
runs
all
the
way
from
nearly
houston
area,
o’brien
which
is
the
home
of
congressman
teague.
northwest
into
the
southern
part
of
dallas
county
drops
down
and
comes
back
around
and
catches
the
south
western
corner
of
tarrant
county.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
fort
worth,
it’s
the
large
metropolitan
area
there
is
a
number
of
smaller
communities
there.
but
in
this
case,
this
is
the
--
we
submit
not
the
proper
case
for
determination
of
the
validity
of
county
line
arguments
in
congressional
redistricting.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
it
is
one
of
the
--
i
believe
slightly
under
populated
districts,
i
don’t
have
that
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
--
figure
in
front
of
me.
but
without
the
inclusion
of
the
southern
part
of
dallas
county
and
the
southwest
corner
of
tarrant
county,
it
would
be
no
district
at
all
and
under
plan
c
the
district
shape
is
radically
altered
to
much
more
reflect
the
fact
that
it
is
predominantly
rural
district.
this
is
the
farm
belt
cattle,
perhaps
the
various
kinds
and
the
community
of
interest
if
any
between
the
people
and
the
southern
part
of
dallas
county
and
the
people
in
the
o’brien
texas
area
is
almost
nil.
finally,
i
wish
again
to
emphasize
that
the
remedy
selected
by
the
court
was
a
conditional
one.
no
argument
is
made
that
the
court
exceeded
its
authority
that
it
was
on
--
that
there
is
no
authority
for
the
imposition
of
court
order
districting.
the
quarrel
i
believe
of
the
appellants
in
the
case
at
bar
is
that
the
legislature
should
have
had
an
opportunity.
they
have
and
have
always
had
that
opportunity.
we
think
that
this
bill
is
manifestly
unconstitutional
because
of
the
lack
of
the
good
faith
effort.
we
are
confronted
with
the
situation
of
consistent
disenfranchisement
in
every
phase
of
government
in
the
state
of
texas.
the
court
was
aware
of
this,
acutely
aware
of
it
and
felt
i’m
sure
that
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
impose
a
constitutional
plan
conditionally
and
give
the
legislature
an
opportunity
to
correct
what
was
wrong.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
if
the
court
please
to
the
first
of
the
appellant’s
arguments
that
is
whether
the
rule
laid
down
in
kirkpatrick
versus
preisler
should
be
retreated
from.
secondly,
i
will
address
myself
to
whether
if
that
not
be
the
case,
the
record
in
this
case
brings
a
case
before
the
court
that
follows
within
the
kirkpatrick
rule
and
thirdly,
i’ll
say
a
word
about
the
remedy
which
was
fashioned
by
the
court
below
in
which
is
an
issue
here
today.
the
grounds
urged
by
appellants,
may
it
please
the
court
in
support
of
its
position
that
kirkpatrick
ought
to
be
retreated
from
our
fourfold.
first
that
kirkpatrick
is
not
supported
by
the
cases
relied
on
in
that
decision.
kirkpatrick
as
i
recall
cited
wesberry
versus
sanders
and
reynolds
versus
sims.
these
cases
where
the
wesberry
of
course
being
the
first
congressional
case
in
this
recent
line
and
reynolds
being
the
major
if
we
may
use
that
term
with
respect
to
any
one
case
decision
with
respect
to
legislative.
from
those
cases,
was
fashioned
the
rule
enunciated
in
kirkpatrick,
we
think
that
the
state
must
make
a
good
faith
effort.
the
emphasis
being
on
the
effort
to
achieve
absolutely
quality
not
that
equality
be
achieve.
if
the
recent
mahan
decision
stands
for
anything,
i
think
it’s
possibly
a
reaffirmation
of
that
principle.
and
we
certainly
don’t
rely
on
that
decision
since
it
was
not
a
congressional
case.
but
as
we
see,
the
plain
wording
of
the
constitution
requires
that
people
of
the
state
elect
the
members
of
the
united
states
house
of
representatives,
not
the
texas
legislature.
if
--
where
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
permit
the
legislatures
to
elect
the
representatives,
certainly
it
could
have
done
so
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
united
states
senators.
the
cleavage
between
the
two
houses,
the
great
compromise
very
clearly
articulated
in
the
wesberry
opinion
but
the
point
that
we
wish
to
emphasize
is
this.
we
are
here
today
because
the
state
of
texas
did
not
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
absolute
equality
not
so
much
that
equality
was
not
achieved.
the
second
reasons
advanced
by
the
appellant
are
the
--
i
believe
they
refer
to
the
kirkpatrick
decision
as
a
draconian
rule
or
procrustean
rule
and
suggest
that
it
is
a
rule
of
absolutism.
i
think
this
is
an
incorrect
reading.
they
asked
the
court
to
make
allowance
for
reasonable
legislative
interplay.
this
proposition
was
of
course
expressly
rejected
in
kirkpatrick.
we
suggest
on
very
sound
reasons.
it
leaves
the
door
open
first
of
all
to
gerrymandering
under
whatever
reason
that
the
legislature
might
have.
and
most
importantly,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
this
proposition
presumes
that
the
legislature
is
unable
to
act
in
good
faith.
we
submit
that
the
function
of
the
legislature
in
congressional
redistricting
cases
is
to
act
impartially
to
apportion
the
congressional
seats
among
the
population
considering
only
factors
of
population
and
nothing
else.
we’re
willing
to
say
that
the
legislature
can
make
that
good
faith
effort
and
we
feel
it
to
presume
otherwise,
is
not
only
a
gratuitous
insult
to
the
legislature
but
to
the
people
that
elected
him
as
well.
i
think
a
moments
time
should
be
devoted
to
the
argument
that
because
census
data
is
inaccurate,
it
cannot
be
that
constitution
requires
a
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
absolute
equality.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i
think
not
in
the
--
not
in
classical
sense
of
trying
to
“divine
intent”
for
example
in
a
criminal
case.
i
don’t
think
and
had
never
suggested
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
is
said
out
with
bad
faith
intent
to
deprive
the
people
of
the
state
of
texas
or
certain
portion
thereof
of
the
full
weight
of
their
bone
in
electing
congressional
representatives.
when
we
talk
about
intent,
we
must
consider
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
justifications
that
the
state
relies
on.
how
did
we
get
the
bill
with
4.1
deviation
top
to
bottom?
we
got
it
for
two
reasons
primarily.
number
one,
the
desire
to
preserve
incumbents,
now
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
this
is
a
legitimate
consideration,
then
the
court
should
and
expressly
say
so
and
would
necessarily
reverse
this
case
but
we
think
it’s
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i
don’t
think
it
can
never
be
neutral.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
well
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
is
to
stand,
we
think
that
this
is
an
element
of
the
equation
in
determining
good
faith
effort.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
no.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
it’s
not.
it’s
been
before
the
court
twice
in
clark
versus
williams
and
in
taylor
versus
mckeithen
but
in
neither
case
did
the
court
reach
those
questions.
they
were
there
on
procedural
matters.
the
district
courts
i
might
add
in
both
of
those
cases
squarely
rejected
this
consideration
and
we
think
on
extremely
legitimate
grounds.
no
congress
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
mr.
justice,
the
members
of
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
are
to
be
elected
by
the
people
and
not
by
the
legislatures.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
well,
i
can’t
follow
the
premise
because,
i
can’t
--
i’m
not
prepared
to
say
that
consideration
of
preserving
incumbents
is
not
otherwise
violative
or
article
i,
section
2.
it’s
our
reading
of
article
i,
section
2
which
we
think
is
consistent
with
wesberry
that
by
the
people
means
by
the
people.
this
is
the
whole
basis
for
the
language
if
we
are
to
take
the
opinion
in
wesberry
as
being
authoritative
on
the
constitutional
history
that
led
to
this.
the
great
compromise
was
that
in
one
branch
of
united
states
legislature,
the
states
were
to
be
represented
and
then
the
other,
the
people.
this
is
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give.
there
are
no
expressed
wordings
of
course
that
preservation
of
incumbents
is
not
prohibited.
but
we
think
that
it
flies
in
the
teeth
of
the
great
compromise
of
article
i,
section
2
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
insofar
as
it
negates,
the
good
faith
effort
that
we
believe
article
i,
section
2
requires.
we
believe
that
article
i,
section
2
requires
there’ll
be
no
considerations
other
than
population
as
overlaid
by
demographics.
we
think
that
kirkpatrick
left
open
for
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
it
could
under
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
oh!
i
wish
i
could
say
that
but
i
don’t
think
i
can.
it
is
our
belief
that
where
the
desire
to
protect
incumbents
subordinates
the
legitimate
considerations
of
population
then
it
rises
to
the
magnitude
of
the
constitutional
violation.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
and
we
believe
not.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i
cannot
think
of
any
justification
to
support
it.
no
congressman
has
the
best
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
no,
i
don’t.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i’m
inclined
to
say
not
in
the
congressional
case.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
plan
b,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
it
was
approximately
three
times
as
great
if
the
amount
involved
is
significant.
plan
b
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
we
have
nothing
in
the
court’s
opinion
other
than
the
statement
that
plan
c
most
closely
effectuates
the
principle
of
one
man,
one
vote.
we
don’t
know
and
i
wouldn’t
presume
or
speculate
on
why
plan
c
was
adopted.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
there
was
nothing
in
the
court’s
opinion.
the
plan
was
before
the
court
for
some
period
of
time,
there’s
some
pleading
of
course
to
support
the
plan
but
the
court
had
comparison
of
the
--
all
three
plans
both
in
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
that
would
be
the
plan
that
the
court
declared
unconstitutional,
s.b.1.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
plan
b
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
and
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
in
all
kinder,
i
do
not.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
i
was.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
it
did.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
only
on
the
basis
that
this
is
what
the
court
imposed.
i
think
the
only
difference
was,
that
plan
c
was
represented
to
the
court
to
be
based
solely
on
population
and
no
other
factor
at
one
time
in
their
pleadings
to
this
effect
there
was
discussion
about
considering
social
and
cultural
and
economic
ties,
community
of
interest
in
this
sort
of
thing.
this
was
some
of
the
discussion
that
appears
in
the
record
among
the
legislators
that
were
concerned
drafting
the
bill.
plan
c
took
none
of
these
at
least
we
are
so
represented
into
account
and
is
based
solely
on
population,
there
was
no
--
as
i
understand
it
regard
for
county
lines
or
at
most
a
minimal
regard.
the
sole
test
was
population.
and
if
i
had
to
speculate
on
what
the
court
below
thought,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
probably
the
basic
reason
that
plan
c
was
adopted.
i
did
wish
to
emphasize
i
think
appropriately
at
this
point
that
plan
c
was
adopted
by
the
court
conditionally.
the
way
it
was
left
wide
open
for
the
legislature
to
hold
the
special
session,
the
legislature
in
point
or
fact
is
in
session
at
this
time,
approximately
one-third
of
the
legislative
session
is
over
so
far
not
a
word
about
a
congressional
redistricting
bill.
there’s
--
whatever
arguments
there
may
be
for
the
fact
that
the
governor
didn’t
call
a
special
session,
there
are
none
now.
the
legislature
is
free
to
adopt
any
plan
including
plan
b.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
i
do,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
are
demographic
arguments
only.
i
think
it
is
certainly
legitimate
for
the
legislature
to
consider
documented
or
is
best
that
the
signs
and
demography
can
document
patterns
of
growth
or
declined
population.
i
think
it
is
--
i
don’t
--
it
will
be
a
boarder
line
situation
to
consider
voting
population
but
certainly
allowance
is
for
demographics
as
suggested
in
kirkpatrick
or
certainly
valid
considerations
but
they
are
neutral
so
long
as
they
are
done
in
a
systematic
way
based
on
as
a
reliable
data
as
is
available
and
not
with
the
intention
of
discriminating
and
not
as
an
afterthought
to
justify
what
has
been
done
for
other
motivations,
protection
of
incumbents,
creating
a
safe
seat
for
one
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
to
run
for
congress.
these
considerations
are
singularly
inappropriate
and
any
other
justification
cannot
be
used
as
a
cover-up
as
it
were.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
our
argument
if
the
court
please
was
we
did
emphasize
that
plan
b
should
be
adopted.
i
would
say
in
defense
to
that
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
we
filed
an
amended
complaint
offering
both
plans
b
and
c.
i
cannot
answer
that
question
mr.
justice
inside
the
record.
but
outside
the
record,
i
thought
it
would
be
appropriate
not
only
to
have
a
plan
with
the
population
disparity
earned
out
as
plan
b
and
to
follow
as
closely
as
possible
what
the
legislature
had
done.
but
i
also
thought
that
we
ought
to
tear
everything
up
and
start
from
scratch
and
i
have
to
admit
to
be
the
imminence
per
se
behind
plan
c
but
it
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record.
but
as
far
as
the
effect
politically
i
have
to
say
in
complete
candid
before
this
court,
i
had
no
idea.
i
would
like
to
discuss
for
a
moment
what
alternatives
there
are
in
the
consideration,
what
the
appropriate
constitutional
test
is.
the
appellants
suggest
that
perhaps
some
sort
of
leeway
ought
to
be
allowed.
they
don’t
argue
that
it
ought
to
be
the
same
leeway
percentagwise
as
between
states.
this
notion
of
course
was
expressly
rejected
in
kirkpatrick.
the
reason
set
forth
in
kirkpatrick
i
think
much
better
answer
that
argument
and
i
can.
we
have
seen
a
very
practical
result
of
this
allowance
of
the
toleration.
this
is
what
the
legislature
is
aimed
for.
we
have
testimony
among
the
people
that
were
moving
forces
behind
these
bills
that
protection
or
that
they
were
allowed
a
toleration
of
between
four
and
10%
and
as
long
as
they
got
within
some
said
4%,
some
said
within
10%,
everything
would
be
alright.
as
one
of
the
witnesses
put
it,
their
desire
was
to
protect
the
incumbents
and
then
make
it
fit
to
numbers
within
5%.
this
is
precisely
a
devise
that
the
court
foresaw
in
kirkpatrick
and
a
very
cogent
reason
for
not
adopting
any
sort
of
de
minimus
standard
by
whatever
name
you
call
it.
it
is
no
more
than
a
de
minimus
standard
to
allow
this
sort
of
toleration.
the
goal
should
be
absolutely
quality.
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
reached
if
there’s
good
reason
for
it
not
to
have
been.
this
is
all
the
constitution
requires
in
our
view.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
that
is
our
view
mr.
justice.
i
think
we
can
find
it
in
the
record
in
this
case.
it
might
be
better
to
say
our
view
is
a
negative
one
of
what
a
good
faith
effort
is
not.
it
is
not
preservation
of
incumbents,
it
is
not
snarling
up
the
legislature
into
a
special
session
to
decide
whether
senator
wilson
will
occupy
congressman
douds’
to
be
vacant
sit
or
whether
representative
heinz
will
have
that
privilege.
and
this
is
what
the
final
map
was
a
product
of.
and
the
reason
and
this
is
well
supported
in
the
record
that
the
lower
bill
adopted
by
the
house
twice
and
sent
to
the
conference
committee
or
sent
to
the
senate
and
end
it
up
in
the
conference
committee
was
not
adopted
because
in
that
bill,
the
home
county
of
representative
or
of
senator
wilson,
angelina
county
was
excluded
from
the
second
district
and
representative
heinz
home
county
was
in
it.
the
final
bill
that
came
out
was
just
the
opposite
way
around.
and
we
must
also
consider
the
fact
that
the
shape
in
one
district
must
necessarily
reflect
the
shape
of
the
others.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
the
shape
of
one
district
must
necessarily
reflect
the
shape
of
others
and
when
i
say
shape,
i
don’t
mean
just
the
geographical
shape;
i
mean
the
number
of
people.
because
you
only
got
so
many
--
you
got
11
million
people
to
work
with,
you
so
many
in
one
district.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
your
honor.
these
were
the
considerations
of
the
legislature.
and
neither
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
mr.
justice
yes.
i
should
talk
for
a
moment
about
the
county
line
argument.
the
court
we
think
in
kirkpatrick
expressly
and
finally
rejected
the
argument
of
the
preservation
of
county
lines
is
a
legitimate
consideration
in
congressional
redistricting.
the
appellants
suggest
that
it
was
rejected
because
it
was
a
sham.
we
find
those
such
language
in
the
opinion
of
this
court.
in
mahan
recently
decided,
the
court
held
as
we
understand
it
that
in
legislative
--
state
legislative
redistricting,
this
was
a
legitimate
consideration
because
the
county
governments
where
in
any
instance
is
functionaries
of
the
state
that
there
was
in
the
case
of
virginia,
there
was
local
legislation
that
affected
counties
only.
we
find
no
such
considerations
or
at
least
not
of
such
a
pervasive
nature
in
congressional
redistricting
as
would
allow
for
any
substantial
variations
based
on
preservation
of
county
lines.
but
the
basic
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
with
the
county
line
argument
is
that
we
don’t
think
it
was
done
on
a
consistent
systematic
basis.
county
lines
were
cut
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
were
necessary.
i
will
retreat
from
the
term
expedient
where
it
was
necessary
to
do
so.
we
have
little
midland
county
with
the
population
of
60.
not
midland
county,
ector
county
with
the
city
of
odessa
is
located
with
a
population
less
than
a
100,000
people
which
cut
in
half
right
through
the
city
of
odessa.
under
s.b.1.,
we
have
instances
in
bexar
county
in
particular
where
largely
rural
districts
intrude
into
bexar
county.
it
point
first
in
the
23rd
districts
whereas
under
plan
c,
i
believe
bexar
county
would
probably
undoubtedly
deal
with
elect
to
congressman.
the
most
blaring
example
is
in
the
sixth
district
which
affects
my
home
county
of
dallas.
the
sixth
district
runs
all
the
way
from
nearly
houston
area,
o’brien
which
is
the
home
of
congressman
teague.
northwest
into
the
southern
part
of
dallas
county
drops
down
and
comes
back
around
and
catches
the
south
western
corner
of
tarrant
county.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
fort
worth,
it’s
the
large
metropolitan
area
there
is
a
number
of
smaller
communities
there.
but
in
this
case,
this
is
the
--
we
submit
not
the
proper
case
for
determination
of
the
validity
of
county
line
arguments
in
congressional
redistricting.
mr.
lawrence
fischman
it
is
one
of
the
--
i
believe
slightly
under
populated
districts,
i
don’t
have
that
--
mr.
lawrence
fischman
--
figure
in
front
of
me.
but
without
the
inclusion
of
the
southern
part
of
dallas
county
and
the
southwest
corner
of
tarrant
county,
it
would
be
no
district
at
all
and
under
plan
c
the
district
shape
is
radically
altered
to
much
more
reflect
the
fact
that
it
is
predominantly
rural
district.
this
is
the
farm
belt
cattle,
perhaps
the
various
kinds
and
the
community
of
interest
if
any
between
the
people
and
the
southern
part
of
dallas
county
and
the
people
in
the
o’brien
texas
area
is
almost
nil.
finally,
i
wish
again
to
emphasize
that
the
remedy
selected
by
the
court
was
a
conditional
one.
no
argument
is
made
that
the
court
exceeded
its
authority
that
it
was
on
--
that
there
is
no
authority
for
the
imposition
of
court
order
districting.
the
quarrel
i
believe
of
the
appellants
in
the
case
at
bar
is
that
the
legislature
should
have
had
an
opportunity.
they
have
and
have
always
had
that
opportunity.
we
think
that
this
bill
is
manifestly
unconstitutional
because
of
the
lack
of
the
good
faith
effort.
we
are
confronted
with
the
situation
of
consistent
disenfranchisement
in
every
phase
of
government
in
the
state
of
texas.
the
court
was
aware
of
this,
acutely
aware
of
it
and
felt
i’m
sure
that
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
impose
a
constitutional
plan
conditionally
and
give
the
legislature
an
opportunity
to
correct
what
was
wrong.
thank
you.
