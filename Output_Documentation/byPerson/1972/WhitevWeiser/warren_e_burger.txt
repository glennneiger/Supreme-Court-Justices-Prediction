mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
be
perhaps
suggesting
on
variation
of
the
test
here
mr.
fischman
if
i
understood
you
correctly.
you
--
i
got
the
impression
you
were
telling
us
that
you
don’t
fault
texas
so
much
for
a
bond
result
as
you
do
for
not
trying
hard
enough.
that’s
the
way
i
read
you
in
any
event.
that
means
that
a
reviewing
court
must
get
in
to
motives
primarily
rather
than
results.
chief
justice
warren
