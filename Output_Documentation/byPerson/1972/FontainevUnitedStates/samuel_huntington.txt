mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
position
is
that
the
files
and
the
records
in
this
case
conclusively
show
within
the
meaning
of
28
u.s.c.
2255
that
petitioner
was
competent
at
the
time
he
pleaded
guilty
to
armed
bank
robbery,
that
his
plea
was
voluntary
and
that
he
validly
waived
counsel
before
entering
the
plea.
the
district
court
was
therefore
warranted
in
denying
petitioner’s
collateral
attack
on
his
plea
without
a
hearing.
now
in
contrast
to
mr.
umin,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
voluntariness
issue
first
and
then
come
to
the
waiver
issue
and
i’d
like
to
point
out
what
we
think
are
the
pertinent
facts
as
far
as
the
voluntariness
issue
is
concerned.
petitioner
alleged
in
his
motion
that
he
was
arrested
on
october
21
and
the
hospital
discharge
summary
attached
to
his
motion
shows
that
on
the
night
or
at
least
on
the
21st,
he
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
a
five-day
stay.
all
of
the
alleged
acts
of
intimidation
and
coercion
referred
to
in
petitioner’s
motion
took
place
either
immediately
after
his
arrest
or
during
that
initial
period
of
hospitalization.
on
november
13th,
or
18
days
after
his
discharge
from
the
hospital,
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
to
armed
bank
robbery
before
judge
kayes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
there
is
not
and
i
would
suggest
that
we
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
when
do
you
have
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
he
did
waive
it
in
open
court
here.
i
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
the
arraignment,
the
guilty
plea
hearing
is
called
the
arraignment
in
the
record.
mr.
samuel
huntington
and
that’s
the
point
when
he
waived
it,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
a
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
there
is
some
ambiguity
at
least
in
my
mind
as
to
when
he
signed
this
waiver.
mr.
umin
suggested
that
the
waiver
was
signed
in
custody.
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
motion
that
he
signed
something
in
custody
but
i
would
submit
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
it
appears
from
the
record
that
he
was
arrested
by
michigan
--
detroit
police
and
it
may
not
have
been
until
sometime
after
he
was
in
custody.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
his
motion,
he
alleges
that
it
was
while
he
was
at
the
hospital
that
the
bank
robbery
charge
came
up.
so
it
could’ve
been
after
he
was
in
custody
under
state
charges
that
the
bank
robbery
came
to
light
and
that
therefore
this
was
the
first
judicial
proceeding
on
the
bank
robbery
charge.
mr.
samuel
huntington
under
federal
charge.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
what
we
had
is
simply
what
mr.
umin
read
to
you
at
the
beginning
of
the
guilty
plea
hearing
where
he
says
he
has
been
given
a
copy
of
the
information,
he
acknowledges
that
he
understands
it
and
knows
what
the
maximum
penalty
is
and
it
says,
“he
informs
me
that
he
wants
to
waive
counsel.”
mr.
samuel
huntington
at
the
beginning,
you
mean,
immediately
prior
to
the
proceedings
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we
don’t.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right.
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
legal
advice.
i
think
the
us
attorney,
all
it
appears
here
is
that
the
us
attorney
informed
him
of
what
the
charges
were,
gave
him
a
copy
of
the
information,
and
asked
him
whether
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty.
there’s
no
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
there’s
no
indication
that
he
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
but,
he
said
he
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
us
attorney
obviously
provided
the
blanks
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--
and
gave
him
the
opportunity
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--
to
waive
counsel.
i
don’t
contest
that.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
the
record
shows
no
--
there’s
no
indication
in
the
record
and
petitioner
has
not
alleged
that
the
us
attorney
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i’m
not
[attempt
to
laughter]
no
and
we
don’t
contend
that
this
amounts
to
a
counsel.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
that
--
and
that
is
what
i’d
like
to
come
to
now.
that
took
place
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
suggest
and
it’s
our
basic
position
that
where
this
is
substantial
period
of
time
between
the
alleged
acts
of
coercion
and
the
guilty
plea
that
then
unless
there
are
some
very
specific
objective,
allegations
of
objective
facts
as
to
why
those
acts
of
coercion
taint
the
plea
that
in
that
situation
it’s
reasonable
to
expect
the
defendant
to
answer
truthfully
to
the
court’s
questions
at
the
guilty
plea
hearing
as
to
whether
there
were
any
threats
or
promises.
now,
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
rule
11
and
the
hearing
which
was
held
here.
now,
rule
11
requires
that
the
judge
personally
address
the
defendant
on
three
matters;
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea,
on
petitioner’s
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge,
and
on
his
understanding
of
the
consequence
of
the
plea.
now,
we
suggest
that
was
complied
with,
if
you
look
at
the
reading
of
the
record,
it
shows
that
was
complied
with.
rule
11
also
requires
that
the
judge
satisfy
himself
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea
and
we
suggest
that
that
also
was
complied
with
here.
with
respect
to
the
point
about
whether
the
bank
was
insured
by
the
fdic,
the
judge
had
before
him
the
information
and
the
information
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it
was
attached
to
the
government’s
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
information
does
state
that
the
bank
was
insured
by
the
fdic,
so
we
believe
that
judge
kayes
would’ve
been
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
federal
element
of
the
offense
was
present
here.
now,
we
acknowledge
that
there
are
situations
and
we
spell
them
out
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
where
a
defendant’s
answers
at
a
guilty
plea
hearing
that
his
plea
is
voluntary
should
not
be
binding
upon
him.
now,
one
obvious
situation
would
be
where
he
later
alleged
that
he
was
mentally
incompetent
at
the
time
of
the
plea
and
another
situation
would
be
where
a
prosecutor
expressly
warns
him
not
to
disclose
the
terms
of
a
promise
of
leniency
to
the
court.
in
this
situation
and
there
are
a
number
of
court
of
appeals,
cases
involving
this
type
of
situation
and
indeed
the
machibroda
case
was
this
type
of
situation.
in
this
type
of
situation
the
defendant
obviously
cannot
be
expected
to
answer
truthfully,
having
been
advised
by
the
prosecutor
to
do
–
to
answer
falsely.
but
apart
from
those
situations,
we
suggest
that
the
defendant
can
be
expected
to
answer
these
questions
that
he
--
the
petitioner
--
the
only
connection
that
petitioner
draws
in
his
motion
between
the
acts
of
coercion
and
the
guilty
plea
is
the
statement
that
the
police
had
conditioned
his
mind
for
the
guilty
plea
hearing.
now,
this
is
a
purely
subjective
allegation.
there
are
no
allegations
that
the
police
continued
to
coerce
him
while
he
was
awaiting
arraignment
or
that
the
police
expressly
warned
him
not
to
disclose
their
threats
to
the
court.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
that
coercive
conduct
maybe
sufficiently
separated
from
a
later
guilty
plea
so
as
not
to
affect
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
in
parker
against
north
carolina,
one
of
the
claims
made
that
alleged
police
conduct
in
procuring
a
confession
in
itself
tainted
a
guilty
plea,
although
it
was
over
a
month
later,
one
of
the
claims
was
that
the
act
in,
coercing
the
confession
tainted
the
plea
a
month
later.
this
court
rejected
that
claim
and
it
said.
“the
connection
if
any
between
parker’s
confession
and
his
plea
of
guilty
had
become
so
attenuated,
to
dissipate
the
taint.”
now,
there
is
a
basic
difference.
the
court
pointed
out
that
in
the
interim,
parker
had
been
represented
by
a
counsel
and
had
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
the
facts
surrounding
the
confession.
but
the
court
also
said
that
after
the
allegedly
coercive
interrogation,
there
were
no
threats,
misrepresentations,
promises
or
other
improper
acts
by
the
state.
now,
petitioner
in
this
case
has
not
alleged
that
there
were
any
threats,
misrepresentations,
promises
or
other
improper
acts
for
the
almost
three-week
period
before
his
plea.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
if
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
there
still
is
a
requirement
that
the
petition
set
forth
facts
which
if
true
would
entitle
him
to
relief
and
there’s
a
requirement
that
it
be
set
forth
with
some
specificity.
in
some
cases
the
district
courts
have
appointed
counsel
to
assist
the
petitioner
in
drafting
his
motion,
but
this
has
not
been
required
by
any
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
in
our
view,
there
is
sound
basis
in
this
court’s
decisions
for
the
general
proposition
that
a
defendant
should
be
bound
by
his
responses
at
a
guilty
plea
hearing.
as
this
court
noted
in
mccarthy
against
the
united
states
at
394
us,
there
are
two
basic
purposes
for
the
rule
11
requirement
that
a
judge
personally
address
the
defendant
before
accepting
a
guilty
plea.
first,
the
rule
is
designed
to
assist
the
judge
in
making
a
determination
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
second,
the
rule
is
intended
to
produce,
and
i
quote
from
the
court’s
opinion,
“a
complete
record
at
the
time
the
plea
is
entered
of
the
factors
relevant
to
this
voluntariness
determination
to
enable
more
expeditious
disposition
of
post-conviction
attacks
on
the
constitutional
validity
of
guilty
pleas.”
later
in
the
opinion,
the
court
observed
that
rule
11
is
designed
to
eliminate
any
need
to
resort
to
any
later
fact
finding
proceedings.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
compliance
with
rule
11
eliminates
the
necessity
for
further
fact
finding
proceedings
in
every
case
and
i
have
referred
to
some
of
the
situations
where
it
would
not.
but
we
do
contend
that
in
this
case
and
as
a
general
rule,
that
the
record
the
defendant
makes
should
bind
him
against
further
proceedings.
now,
the
cases
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
know
he
was
in
the
hospital.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
know
he
was
in
custody.
we
don’t
know
what
the
terms
of
custody
were,
who
he
saw
or
any
facts,
that’s
correct,
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
we
would
say
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
contains
very
serious
allegations.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes
but
we
suggest
that
it’s
--
that
the
allegations
are
defective
in
one
critical
point.
they’re
very
specific
up
to
the
--
his
confinement
in
the
hospital
but
then
there
is
an
18-day
period
before
the
plea
and
they
make
no
allegations
as
to
what
happen
then.
now,
we
suggest
that
in
bringing
the
motion
for
collateral
relief,
the
prisoner
has
to
allege
facts
which
show
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
relief.
now
he
has
not
alleged
facts
which
tie
together
the
coercion
with
his
plea.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
i’m
not
saying.
i’m
not
saying.
what
we
do
say,
we
do
say
that
there
is
a
substantial
doubt
as
to
whether
they
are
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
correct,
whether
they
are
true.
mr.
samuel
huntington
but
we
also
say
that
that
where
you
are
specifically
asked
in
open
court
at
a
time
and
place
removed
from
the
acts
of
coercion,
you’re
specifically
asked
by
a
judge
in
a
rule
11
hearing,
“were
there
any
acts
of
coercion?
and
you
say
no
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
don’t
concede
that
and
i
would
suggest
that
a
reading
of
our
brief
shows
that
we
do
make
the
two
arguments.
the
one
i’m
making
now
that
he
should
be
bound
that
given
the
opportunity
to
disclose
the
threats
and
not
only
given
the
opportunity
but
specifically
asked
by
the
judge,
“were
there
any
threats?
were
there
any
promises?”
and
he
says
no.
it
is
our
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
that’s
correct
but
the
whole
purpose
of
rule
11
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
that
would
not
be
a
better
procedure,
that
if
someone
was
there
and
that
he
obviously
isn’t
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
he
did
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
--
he
did
and
i
will
come
to
this
point
in
a
moment.
he
did
waive
counsel
and
that
he
--
the
provision
that
is
made
to
give
him
the
advice
that
might
be
useful
in
determining
the
plea.
mr.
samuel
huntington
did
he
sign
one?
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
he
signed
a
waiver
of
counsel
and
i
think
the
record
indicates
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right
and
the
judge
referred
to
that
fact
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it’s
not
even
clear
it’s
outside
of
the
court.
it
could’ve
been
right
there
at
the
proceeding
just
before
the
judge
walked
in.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
there
is
no
indication
he
walked
in.
there’s
simply
indication
that
he
told
the
judge
that
he
had
talked
with
him.
now,
whether
that
was
right
then
or
whether
it
is
at
some
previous
time
that
isn’t
indicated
on
the
record.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
not
when
--
we
believe
that
the
judge
then
went
on
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we
believe
the
record--
the
fair
inference
from
the
record
is
that
that
he
was
offering
counsel
at
the
present
time.
he
was
saying,
“you
have
a
right
to
counsel.
is
it
your
wish
to
proceed
without
counsel?”
and
that
point
he
said,
“i
guess
so.”
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
we
know
the
statutory
standard
is
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
our
basic
contention,
it’s
a
two-fold
contention.
that
our
first
argument
is
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
if
he
is
given
the
opportunity,
i
mean
if
he
is
asked
in
compliance
to
rule
11,
“were
there
any
threats?”
and
he
says,
“no,
there
weren’t
and
there
are
none
of
the
special
circumstances
present
which
we
concede
would
relieve
him
from
the
binding
effect
of
that
answer,
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
is
not
entitled
later
on
to
contradict
that
record
which
he
himself
made
and
that
that
is
what
is
conclusively
shows
that
he
is
entitled
to
no
relief,
but
we
don’t
rely
exclusively
on
that
position.
we
also
say
that
if
you
look
at
as
mr.
stewart
pointed
out
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
records
that
there
is
enough
here
to
show
that
he
was
entitled
to
no
relief
in
any
event
and
i
would
just
refer
briefly
to
those.
we
think
that
the
fact
that
a
central
part
of
his
allegations
are
that
he
was
innocent,
that
he
did
not
rob
any
bank,
that
the
police
convinced
him
that
he
was
a
bona
fide
bank
robber
and
told
them
that
he
had
robbed
this
bank
at
a
certain
time.
well,
we
think
that
the
record
as
a
whole
refutes
this
allegation.
first
of
all
in
the
guilty
plea
hearing,
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
chief
justice,
his
answers
were
very
specific.
yes,
he
had
a
pistol.
yes,
he
held
up
the
teller
and
he
took
the
money
and
later
at
sentencing,
he
made
the
statement
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
drugs
“when
this
happened”
and
that’s
a
clear
admission
of
guilt.
the
other
factors,
very
important
in
his
allegations
are
the
allegations
of
brutality
when
he
was
arrested.
he
alleged
he
was
clubbed
into
an
unconscious
state
of
mind
at
his
home,
that
he
was
struck
several
times
with
fists
and
open
hands
at
the
police
station.
that
the
abdominal
gunshot
wound
was
torn
open
and
began
to
bleed
freely.
he
also
asserted
he
was
beaten
for
asking
to
see
an
attorney
and
then
the
brief
of
law
attached
to
his
motion,
he
claimed
he
had
been
brutally
assaulted,
beaten
with
the
clubs
and
blackjacks
and
kicked.
now,
yet
the
hospital
records
pertaining
to
his
period
of
hospitalization
beginning
on
the
night
of
the
arrest
makes
no
references
to
any
bruises
or
recent
bleeding.
and
surely
that
would
have
been
an
evidence
had
petitioner
suffered
the
type
of
mistreatment
that
he
claims
he
had
suffered.
now,
the
--
we
also
would
say
that
the
21-month
delay
between
the
guilty
plea
hearing
and
the
time
that
he
filed
his
motion
is
also
indicative
of
the
lack
of
substance.
it’s
certainly
not
a
controlling
point
that
we
think
it
does
when
added
together
with
all
the
other
factors
does
show
that
this
is
not
a
--
that
the
motion
is
not
well
founded.
now,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
was
mentally
competent
at
the
time
is
covered
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
go
into
that
now.
on
the
waiver
of
counsel
issue,
i’d
like
to
just
make
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
petitioner
was
26
years
old.
he
had
a
seventh
grade
education
and
by
his
own
admission,
he
had
a
long
criminal
record
and
had
been
proceeded
against
in
numerous
criminal
proceedings.
in
his
petition
at
page
11,
he
admits
that
he
misspoke
when
he
informed
the
court
that
he
didn’t
have
a
record
at
the
guilty
plea
hearing
and
admitted
that
he
had
a
long
record
and
also
indicated
the
f
--
he
referred
to
fbi
records
which
would
indicate
that
there
had
been
federal
charges
as
well.
it’s
thus
highly
unlikely
that
he
was
confused
when
the
judge
advised
him
of
his
right
to
counsel.
now,
we
would
also
point
out
that
in
the
light
of
this,
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
us
attorney
had
given
him
the
waiver
form,
he
had
signed
the
waiver
form,
the
waiver
of
counsel.
the
us
attorney
had
given
him
the
information
and
said
that
he
had
acknowledged
that
he
understood
it.
the
information
claim
contained
the
elements
of
the
offense.
so
that,
we
say
that
when
you
look
at
this
record
as
a
whole,
it
shows
that
there
was
an
intelligent
and
knowing
waiver
of
counsel
and
that
therefore,
at
that
point,
that
there
was
a
valid
waiver.
well,
in
conclusion,
it's
argued
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
position
is
that
the
files
and
the
records
in
this
case
conclusively
show
within
the
meaning
of
28
u.s.c.
2255
that
petitioner
was
competent
at
the
time
he
pleaded
guilty
to
armed
bank
robbery,
that
his
plea
was
voluntary
and
that
he
validly
waived
counsel
before
entering
the
plea.
the
district
court
was
therefore
warranted
in
denying
petitioner’s
collateral
attack
on
his
plea
without
a
hearing.
now
in
contrast
to
mr.
umin,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
voluntariness
issue
first
and
then
come
to
the
waiver
issue
and
i’d
like
to
point
out
what
we
think
are
the
pertinent
facts
as
far
as
the
voluntariness
issue
is
concerned.
petitioner
alleged
in
his
motion
that
he
was
arrested
on
october
21
and
the
hospital
discharge
summary
attached
to
his
motion
shows
that
on
the
night
or
at
least
on
the
21st,
he
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
a
five-day
stay.
all
of
the
alleged
acts
of
intimidation
and
coercion
referred
to
in
petitioner’s
motion
took
place
either
immediately
after
his
arrest
or
during
that
initial
period
of
hospitalization.
on
november
13th,
or
18
days
after
his
discharge
from
the
hospital,
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
to
armed
bank
robbery
before
judge
kayes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
there
is
not
and
i
would
suggest
that
we
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
when
do
you
have
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
he
did
waive
it
in
open
court
here.
i
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
the
arraignment,
the
guilty
plea
hearing
is
called
the
arraignment
in
the
record.
mr.
samuel
huntington
and
that’s
the
point
when
he
waived
it,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
a
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
there
is
some
ambiguity
at
least
in
my
mind
as
to
when
he
signed
this
waiver.
mr.
umin
suggested
that
the
waiver
was
signed
in
custody.
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
motion
that
he
signed
something
in
custody
but
i
would
submit
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
it
appears
from
the
record
that
he
was
arrested
by
michigan
--
detroit
police
and
it
may
not
have
been
until
sometime
after
he
was
in
custody.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
his
motion,
he
alleges
that
it
was
while
he
was
at
the
hospital
that
the
bank
robbery
charge
came
up.
so
it
could’ve
been
after
he
was
in
custody
under
state
charges
that
the
bank
robbery
came
to
light
and
that
therefore
this
was
the
first
judicial
proceeding
on
the
bank
robbery
charge.
mr.
samuel
huntington
under
federal
charge.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
what
we
had
is
simply
what
mr.
umin
read
to
you
at
the
beginning
of
the
guilty
plea
hearing
where
he
says
he
has
been
given
a
copy
of
the
information,
he
acknowledges
that
he
understands
it
and
knows
what
the
maximum
penalty
is
and
it
says,
“he
informs
me
that
he
wants
to
waive
counsel.”
mr.
samuel
huntington
at
the
beginning,
you
mean,
immediately
prior
to
the
proceedings
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we
don’t.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right.
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
legal
advice.
i
think
the
us
attorney,
all
it
appears
here
is
that
the
us
attorney
informed
him
of
what
the
charges
were,
gave
him
a
copy
of
the
information,
and
asked
him
whether
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty.
there’s
no
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
there’s
no
indication
that
he
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
but,
he
said
he
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
us
attorney
obviously
provided
the
blanks
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--
and
gave
him
the
opportunity
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
--
to
waive
counsel.
i
don’t
contest
that.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
the
record
shows
no
--
there’s
no
indication
in
the
record
and
petitioner
has
not
alleged
that
the
us
attorney
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i’m
not
[attempt
to
laughter]
no
and
we
don’t
contend
that
this
amounts
to
a
counsel.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
that
--
and
that
is
what
i’d
like
to
come
to
now.
that
took
place
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
suggest
and
it’s
our
basic
position
that
where
this
is
substantial
period
of
time
between
the
alleged
acts
of
coercion
and
the
guilty
plea
that
then
unless
there
are
some
very
specific
objective,
allegations
of
objective
facts
as
to
why
those
acts
of
coercion
taint
the
plea
that
in
that
situation
it’s
reasonable
to
expect
the
defendant
to
answer
truthfully
to
the
court’s
questions
at
the
guilty
plea
hearing
as
to
whether
there
were
any
threats
or
promises.
now,
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
rule
11
and
the
hearing
which
was
held
here.
now,
rule
11
requires
that
the
judge
personally
address
the
defendant
on
three
matters;
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea,
on
petitioner’s
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge,
and
on
his
understanding
of
the
consequence
of
the
plea.
now,
we
suggest
that
was
complied
with,
if
you
look
at
the
reading
of
the
record,
it
shows
that
was
complied
with.
rule
11
also
requires
that
the
judge
satisfy
himself
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea
and
we
suggest
that
that
also
was
complied
with
here.
with
respect
to
the
point
about
whether
the
bank
was
insured
by
the
fdic,
the
judge
had
before
him
the
information
and
the
information
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it
was
attached
to
the
government’s
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
information
does
state
that
the
bank
was
insured
by
the
fdic,
so
we
believe
that
judge
kayes
would’ve
been
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
federal
element
of
the
offense
was
present
here.
now,
we
acknowledge
that
there
are
situations
and
we
spell
them
out
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
where
a
defendant’s
answers
at
a
guilty
plea
hearing
that
his
plea
is
voluntary
should
not
be
binding
upon
him.
now,
one
obvious
situation
would
be
where
he
later
alleged
that
he
was
mentally
incompetent
at
the
time
of
the
plea
and
another
situation
would
be
where
a
prosecutor
expressly
warns
him
not
to
disclose
the
terms
of
a
promise
of
leniency
to
the
court.
in
this
situation
and
there
are
a
number
of
court
of
appeals,
cases
involving
this
type
of
situation
and
indeed
the
machibroda
case
was
this
type
of
situation.
in
this
type
of
situation
the
defendant
obviously
cannot
be
expected
to
answer
truthfully,
having
been
advised
by
the
prosecutor
to
do
–
to
answer
falsely.
but
apart
from
those
situations,
we
suggest
that
the
defendant
can
be
expected
to
answer
these
questions
that
he
--
the
petitioner
--
the
only
connection
that
petitioner
draws
in
his
motion
between
the
acts
of
coercion
and
the
guilty
plea
is
the
statement
that
the
police
had
conditioned
his
mind
for
the
guilty
plea
hearing.
now,
this
is
a
purely
subjective
allegation.
there
are
no
allegations
that
the
police
continued
to
coerce
him
while
he
was
awaiting
arraignment
or
that
the
police
expressly
warned
him
not
to
disclose
their
threats
to
the
court.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
that
coercive
conduct
maybe
sufficiently
separated
from
a
later
guilty
plea
so
as
not
to
affect
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
in
parker
against
north
carolina,
one
of
the
claims
made
that
alleged
police
conduct
in
procuring
a
confession
in
itself
tainted
a
guilty
plea,
although
it
was
over
a
month
later,
one
of
the
claims
was
that
the
act
in,
coercing
the
confession
tainted
the
plea
a
month
later.
this
court
rejected
that
claim
and
it
said.
“the
connection
if
any
between
parker’s
confession
and
his
plea
of
guilty
had
become
so
attenuated,
to
dissipate
the
taint.”
now,
there
is
a
basic
difference.
the
court
pointed
out
that
in
the
interim,
parker
had
been
represented
by
a
counsel
and
had
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
the
facts
surrounding
the
confession.
but
the
court
also
said
that
after
the
allegedly
coercive
interrogation,
there
were
no
threats,
misrepresentations,
promises
or
other
improper
acts
by
the
state.
now,
petitioner
in
this
case
has
not
alleged
that
there
were
any
threats,
misrepresentations,
promises
or
other
improper
acts
for
the
almost
three-week
period
before
his
plea.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
if
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
there
still
is
a
requirement
that
the
petition
set
forth
facts
which
if
true
would
entitle
him
to
relief
and
there’s
a
requirement
that
it
be
set
forth
with
some
specificity.
in
some
cases
the
district
courts
have
appointed
counsel
to
assist
the
petitioner
in
drafting
his
motion,
but
this
has
not
been
required
by
any
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
in
our
view,
there
is
sound
basis
in
this
court’s
decisions
for
the
general
proposition
that
a
defendant
should
be
bound
by
his
responses
at
a
guilty
plea
hearing.
as
this
court
noted
in
mccarthy
against
the
united
states
at
394
us,
there
are
two
basic
purposes
for
the
rule
11
requirement
that
a
judge
personally
address
the
defendant
before
accepting
a
guilty
plea.
first,
the
rule
is
designed
to
assist
the
judge
in
making
a
determination
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
second,
the
rule
is
intended
to
produce,
and
i
quote
from
the
court’s
opinion,
“a
complete
record
at
the
time
the
plea
is
entered
of
the
factors
relevant
to
this
voluntariness
determination
to
enable
more
expeditious
disposition
of
post-conviction
attacks
on
the
constitutional
validity
of
guilty
pleas.”
later
in
the
opinion,
the
court
observed
that
rule
11
is
designed
to
eliminate
any
need
to
resort
to
any
later
fact
finding
proceedings.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
compliance
with
rule
11
eliminates
the
necessity
for
further
fact
finding
proceedings
in
every
case
and
i
have
referred
to
some
of
the
situations
where
it
would
not.
but
we
do
contend
that
in
this
case
and
as
a
general
rule,
that
the
record
the
defendant
makes
should
bind
him
against
further
proceedings.
now,
the
cases
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
know
he
was
in
the
hospital.
mr.
samuel
huntington
we
know
he
was
in
custody.
we
don’t
know
what
the
terms
of
custody
were,
who
he
saw
or
any
facts,
that’s
correct,
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
we
would
say
that
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
contains
very
serious
allegations.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes
but
we
suggest
that
it’s
--
that
the
allegations
are
defective
in
one
critical
point.
they’re
very
specific
up
to
the
--
his
confinement
in
the
hospital
but
then
there
is
an
18-day
period
before
the
plea
and
they
make
no
allegations
as
to
what
happen
then.
now,
we
suggest
that
in
bringing
the
motion
for
collateral
relief,
the
prisoner
has
to
allege
facts
which
show
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
relief.
now
he
has
not
alleged
facts
which
tie
together
the
coercion
with
his
plea.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
i’m
not
saying.
i’m
not
saying.
what
we
do
say,
we
do
say
that
there
is
a
substantial
doubt
as
to
whether
they
are
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
correct,
whether
they
are
true.
mr.
samuel
huntington
but
we
also
say
that
that
where
you
are
specifically
asked
in
open
court
at
a
time
and
place
removed
from
the
acts
of
coercion,
you’re
specifically
asked
by
a
judge
in
a
rule
11
hearing,
“were
there
any
acts
of
coercion?
and
you
say
no
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
don’t
concede
that
and
i
would
suggest
that
a
reading
of
our
brief
shows
that
we
do
make
the
two
arguments.
the
one
i’m
making
now
that
he
should
be
bound
that
given
the
opportunity
to
disclose
the
threats
and
not
only
given
the
opportunity
but
specifically
asked
by
the
judge,
“were
there
any
threats?
were
there
any
promises?”
and
he
says
no.
it
is
our
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
that’s
correct
but
the
whole
purpose
of
rule
11
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
that
would
not
be
a
better
procedure,
that
if
someone
was
there
and
that
he
obviously
isn’t
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
he
did
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
--
he
did
and
i
will
come
to
this
point
in
a
moment.
he
did
waive
counsel
and
that
he
--
the
provision
that
is
made
to
give
him
the
advice
that
might
be
useful
in
determining
the
plea.
mr.
samuel
huntington
did
he
sign
one?
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
he
signed
a
waiver
of
counsel
and
i
think
the
record
indicates
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right
and
the
judge
referred
to
that
fact
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it’s
not
even
clear
it’s
outside
of
the
court.
it
could’ve
been
right
there
at
the
proceeding
just
before
the
judge
walked
in.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
there
is
no
indication
he
walked
in.
there’s
simply
indication
that
he
told
the
judge
that
he
had
talked
with
him.
now,
whether
that
was
right
then
or
whether
it
is
at
some
previous
time
that
isn’t
indicated
on
the
record.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
not
when
--
we
believe
that
the
judge
then
went
on
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we
believe
the
record--
the
fair
inference
from
the
record
is
that
that
he
was
offering
counsel
at
the
present
time.
he
was
saying,
“you
have
a
right
to
counsel.
is
it
your
wish
to
proceed
without
counsel?”
and
that
point
he
said,
“i
guess
so.”
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
we
know
the
statutory
standard
is
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
our
basic
contention,
it’s
a
two-fold
contention.
that
our
first
argument
is
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
if
he
is
given
the
opportunity,
i
mean
if
he
is
asked
in
compliance
to
rule
11,
“were
there
any
threats?”
and
he
says,
“no,
there
weren’t
and
there
are
none
of
the
special
circumstances
present
which
we
concede
would
relieve
him
from
the
binding
effect
of
that
answer,
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
is
not
entitled
later
on
to
contradict
that
record
which
he
himself
made
and
that
that
is
what
is
conclusively
shows
that
he
is
entitled
to
no
relief,
but
we
don’t
rely
exclusively
on
that
position.
we
also
say
that
if
you
look
at
as
mr.
stewart
pointed
out
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
records
that
there
is
enough
here
to
show
that
he
was
entitled
to
no
relief
in
any
event
and
i
would
just
refer
briefly
to
those.
we
think
that
the
fact
that
a
central
part
of
his
allegations
are
that
he
was
innocent,
that
he
did
not
rob
any
bank,
that
the
police
convinced
him
that
he
was
a
bona
fide
bank
robber
and
told
them
that
he
had
robbed
this
bank
at
a
certain
time.
well,
we
think
that
the
record
as
a
whole
refutes
this
allegation.
first
of
all
in
the
guilty
plea
hearing,
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
chief
justice,
his
answers
were
very
specific.
yes,
he
had
a
pistol.
yes,
he
held
up
the
teller
and
he
took
the
money
and
later
at
sentencing,
he
made
the
statement
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
drugs
“when
this
happened”
and
that’s
a
clear
admission
of
guilt.
the
other
factors,
very
important
in
his
allegations
are
the
allegations
of
brutality
when
he
was
arrested.
he
alleged
he
was
clubbed
into
an
unconscious
state
of
mind
at
his
home,
that
he
was
struck
several
times
with
fists
and
open
hands
at
the
police
station.
that
the
abdominal
gunshot
wound
was
torn
open
and
began
to
bleed
freely.
he
also
asserted
he
was
beaten
for
asking
to
see
an
attorney
and
then
the
brief
of
law
attached
to
his
motion,
he
claimed
he
had
been
brutally
assaulted,
beaten
with
the
clubs
and
blackjacks
and
kicked.
now,
yet
the
hospital
records
pertaining
to
his
period
of
hospitalization
beginning
on
the
night
of
the
arrest
makes
no
references
to
any
bruises
or
recent
bleeding.
and
surely
that
would
have
been
an
evidence
had
petitioner
suffered
the
type
of
mistreatment
that
he
claims
he
had
suffered.
now,
the
--
we
also
would
say
that
the
21-month
delay
between
the
guilty
plea
hearing
and
the
time
that
he
filed
his
motion
is
also
indicative
of
the
lack
of
substance.
it’s
certainly
not
a
controlling
point
that
we
think
it
does
when
added
together
with
all
the
other
factors
does
show
that
this
is
not
a
--
that
the
motion
is
not
well
founded.
now,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
was
mentally
competent
at
the
time
is
covered
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
go
into
that
now.
on
the
waiver
of
counsel
issue,
i’d
like
to
just
make
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
petitioner
was
26
years
old.
he
had
a
seventh
grade
education
and
by
his
own
admission,
he
had
a
long
criminal
record
and
had
been
proceeded
against
in
numerous
criminal
proceedings.
in
his
petition
at
page
11,
he
admits
that
he
misspoke
when
he
informed
the
court
that
he
didn’t
have
a
record
at
the
guilty
plea
hearing
and
admitted
that
he
had
a
long
record
and
also
indicated
the
f
--
he
referred
to
fbi
records
which
would
indicate
that
there
had
been
federal
charges
as
well.
it’s
thus
highly
unlikely
that
he
was
confused
when
the
judge
advised
him
of
his
right
to
counsel.
now,
we
would
also
point
out
that
in
the
light
of
this,
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
us
attorney
had
given
him
the
waiver
form,
he
had
signed
the
waiver
form,
the
waiver
of
counsel.
the
us
attorney
had
given
him
the
information
and
said
that
he
had
acknowledged
that
he
understood
it.
the
information
claim
contained
the
elements
of
the
offense.
so
that,
we
say
that
when
you
look
at
this
record
as
a
whole,
it
shows
that
there
was
an
intelligent
and
knowing
waiver
of
counsel
and
that
therefore,
at
that
point,
that
there
was
a
valid
waiver.
well,
in
conclusion,
it's
argued
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
