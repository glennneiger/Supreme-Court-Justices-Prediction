we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
71-6757,
fontaine
against
the
united
states.
mr.
umin,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’re
running,
as
you
know,
a
little
over
and
we’ll
hope
that
you
will
move
right
along
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don’t
you
think
that
cleared
up
whatever
ambiguity
troubled
you
about
the
first
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
umin,
are
the
matters
on
the
bottom
half
of
page
five
and
six
irrelevant
to
the
points
you’re
making
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
detailed
description
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
it’s
entirely
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
have
any
bearing
on
the
question
of
his
own
evaluation
of
his
need
for
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
by
his
own
statement,
he’s
done
all
of
these
things.
he
had
a
gun
and
he
took
the
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
only
goes
[voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
abstract
about
the
question
“and
by
the
use
of
a
gun,
a
pistol,
right?”
and
he
answers,
“right.”

[voice

way
down,
“and
by
the
use
of
a
gun.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
he
repeated
that
by
going
from
the
abstract,
if
you
want
to
describe
it
that
way
to
the
concrete,
he
said,
“what
did
you
do
on
october
8?”
and
his
answer
was
“i
held
a
bank
up.”
“what?”
“i
held
up
the
teller.”
anything
ambiguous
or
evasive
or
uncertain
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
question
whether
--
do
you
now
question
whether
it
was
or
was
not
a
federal
bank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
sure
that
it’s
not
a
federal--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
your
observations
would
also
relate
to
his
response
when
he
explained
why
he
was
tendering
a
guilty
plea
on
this
next
page.
“well,
your
honor,
i
wish
you
would
accept
my
plea
on
the
fact
that
i
have
never
had
a
past
record.
i
got
strung
up
on
drugs
and
i
started
to
make
some
money.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn’t
the
statute
require
that
if
he’s
available,
they
have
the
same
judge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
maybe
it’s
just
the
practice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
umin.
mr.
huntington.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
forgotten,
was
this
a
pro
se
petition
at
that
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
that
would
–
i
have
to
say
that
it
wouldn’t
be
very
crucial,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven’t
we
treated
the
pro
se
petition
as
merely
the
mechanism
to
get
the
man
into
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn’t
your
--
don’t
you
have
to
bear
the
burden
here
now
of
meeting
the
statutory
standard
which
i
think
is
in
terms
that
unless
on
the
face
of
the
record,
it
conclusively
appears
then
you
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
this
transcript
of
this
interrogation
under
rule
11
conclusively
shows
that
none
of
these
things
could
be
true.
isn’t
that
the
posture
of
the
case?

else
can
the
district
judge
avoid
the
hearing

he
makes
the
finding
