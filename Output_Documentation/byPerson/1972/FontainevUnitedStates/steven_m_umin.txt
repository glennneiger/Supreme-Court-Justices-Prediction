mr.

--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i’ll
do
my
best,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
challenges
the
validity
of
a
guilty
plea,
federal
armed
bank
robbery,
entered
by
the
petitioner
david
x.
fontaine
in
federal
court
in
november
of
1969.
the
issues
that
the
case
raises
were
each
presented
pro
se
by
mr.
fontaine
in
his
motion
to
vacate
sentence
under
28
u.s.c.
2255
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i'll
indulge
in
some
oversimplification
initially
and
define
those
issues
as
follows.
first,
whether
2255
entitled
the
petitioner
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
upon
his
concrete
allegations
which
he
had
threw
--
which
show
that
his
guilty
plea
was
coerced.
and
second
and
even
more
important,
i
would
suggest,
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
petitioner’s
guilty
plea
is
void
on
the
face
of
the
existing
record,
without
further
evidentiary
hearing,
for
want
of
a
valid
sixth
amendment
waiver
of
counsel.
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
is
the
history
of
inattention
to
to
detail.
in
the
face
of
the
petitioner’s
concrete
allegations,
the
police’s
physical
and
mental
abuse,
united
states
attorney
declined
even
to
answer
those
specific
allegations.
the
district
court
nonetheless
denied
the
petitioner’s
claims
summarily
without
a
hearing,
his
waiver
of
counsel
points
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioner
had
participated
in
a
rule
11
proceeding
at
guilty
plea
and
his
voluntariness
claim
on
the
same
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
typical
of
the
inattention
paid
to
this
case,
affirmed
the
summary
denial
below
in
one
sentence
and
that
sentence
contained
an
error,
an
error
dealing
with
the
ground
of
decision
by
the
district
court.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
appointed
counsel.
i
mentioned
the
appointment
only
to
highlight
that
the
absence
of
counsel
at
all
prior
stages
of
this
case
and
most
particularly
at
the
guilty
plea
itself
is
the
critical
fact
at
hand.
from
arrest
through
custody,
through
plea
and
sentencing,
the
absence
of
counsel
raises
the
federal
issue
whether
this
record,
the
existing
record
made
at
the
guilty
plea,
discloses
a
waiver
of
counsel
compatible
with
the
sixth
amendment
standards.
the
issue
must
be
framed
precisely.
this
is
not
a
question
of
whether
at
a
guilty
plea
proceeding
there
was
an
offer
of
counsel
and
a
rejection
of
counsel.
we
can
argue
about
that.
i
do
believe
that
the
record
shows
something
resembling
an
offer
and
something
resembling
a
rejection.
but
the
question
is
whether
even
if
there
was
a
meaningful
offer
of
counsel
and
an
offer
of
reject
--
and
a
rejection
of
counsel,
the
circumstances
of
that
offer
and
rejection
disclose
an
understanding
and
intelligent
waiver
under
the
sixth
amendment.
to
quote
from
carnley
against
cochran,
“in
the
absence
of
an
understanding
of
an
intelligent
waiver
anything
less
is
not
waiver.”
let
me
say
one
word
if
i
may
about
the
position
of
that
issue
in
this
case.
it
stands
as
point
number
four
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
on
page
47.
in
my
judgment
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
it
to
the
court,
it’s
point
number
one
in
the
case.
so,
i’m
something
in
the
position
of
a
college
debater
that
i
once
heard
who
perhaps
over-tied
to
the
structure
of
his
own
argument,
had
to
begin
by
announcing
to
his
audience
that
i
have
four
points
to
make,
let
me
make
the
fourth
one
first.
the
waiver
of
counsel
point
is
indeed
number
four
in
the
brief,
but
it’s
number
one
the
case.
let
me
turn
to
the
facts
that
surround
the
waiver
of
counsel
point,
making
two
things
clear
at
the
outset.
absolutely
nothing
about
that
point
depends
upon
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
petitioner’s
allegations
pertaining
to
police
abuse
or
coercion.
likewise,
absolutely
nothing
about
the
waiver
of
counsel
claim
depends
upon
the
trial
court’s
alleged
compliance
with
the
rule
11
at
the
guilty
plea
proceeding.
the
waiver
of
counsel
point
depends
entirely
upon
the
record
made
at
that
proceeding
for
it’s
the
record
which
must
disclose
whether
there
was
not
merely
an
offer
and
rejection
of
counsel
but
an
understanding,
an
intelligent
one.
it
is
the
record
to
which
johnson
against
zerbst,
carnley
against
cochran
and
boykin
against
alabama
refers.
that
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
arrested
on
october
21,
1969.
that
with
the
exception
of
a
hospitalization
he
was
in
continuous
custody.
it
is
un-denied
on
the
record
that
he
was
never
arraigned
at
which
time
he
might
have
been
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel.
even
those
facts
are
strictly
speaking
irrelevant.
the
first
fact
which
is
critical
is
that
during
his
custody,
he
signed
two
pieces
of
paper,
alleged
waivers
of
grand
jury
indictment
and
counsel.
and
on
november
13,
he
came
to
court
in
the
company
of
united
states
attorney
without
a
lawyer
and
the
plea
proceeding
took
place.
i
could
read
all
of
that
proceeding
to
this
court
in
approximately
four
minutes
at
a
reasonable
pace.
doubling
the
time,
let’s
assume
that
plea
proceeding
took
eight
minutes
in
federal
court.
there
is
of
course
no
time
requirement
on
a
guilty
plea
proceeding
but
i
would
submit
that
it
is
some
index,
the
brevity
of
this
proceeding
is
some
index
of
the
care
and
attention
that
was
paid
to
the
plea
proceeding
as
a
whole
and
to
the
question
of
the
waiver
of
counsel,
and
i
would
read
for
you
only
that
part
of
the
proceeding
which
deals
with
the
waiver
of
counsel,
the
very
beginning
of
it
and
i’ll
be
very
brief.
the
united
states
attorney
on
page
3
of
the
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
mr.
zanglin
(ph)
begins,
“your
honor,
this
is
an
arraignment
on
an
information
charging
the
defendant
with
armed
bank
robbery.
he’s
been
given
a
copy
of
the
information.
he
acknowledges
that
he
understands
it
and
knows
what
the
maximum
penalty
is.
i
have
explained
to
him
his
right
to
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury.
he
has
waived
that
right
and
signed
a
waiver
of
rights
form.
he
understands
that
he
has
a
right
for
an
attorney
at
this
time
and
informs
me
that
he
wants
to
waive
that
right
and
has
signed
the
waiver
of
that
right.
knowing
all
of
these
rights,
he
informs
me
he
intends
to
plead
guilty
of
the
information.”
the
court,
“you
are
mr.
david
fontaine?”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes
sir.”
the
court,
“did
you
ever
receive
the
copy
of
the
information
here,
the
charge
against
you
for
armed
bank
robbery,
is
that
right?”
defendant
fontaine,
“right.”
the
court,
“the
first
thing
of
consequence
is
that
you
have
signed
also
a
waiver
of
grand
jury
indictment
which
means
you
are
entitled
to
have
this
matter
first
submitted
to
a
grand
jury
and
a
determination
made
by
that
body
and
an
indictment
returned
first.”
if
the
court
please,
may
i
pause
there
to
indicate
that
the
trial
court
in
accepting
a
plea
first
emphasizes
the
waiver
of
grand
jury
indictment
out
of
court
and
then
to
the
extent
that
it
defines
waiver
at
all
defines
it
exactly
erroneously.
a
waiver
of
a
grand
jury
indictment
does
not
mean
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
this
matter
first
submitted
to
as
grand
jury.
it
means
exactly
the
opposite
of
that.
the
court
then
continues,
“do
you
understand
that
the
rights
you
have
there
under?
anyway,
that’s
what
you
will
get
if
you
wanted
it
to
go
to
the
grand
jury.”
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
not,
your
honor
because
all
the
court
does
is
ask
the
defendant,
do
you
understand
that
and
the
rights
you
have
there
under?
if
he
understood
that,
that
definition
of
waiver,
he
would
be
understanding
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
waiver
was.
anyway,
the
court
says,
“that’s
what
you
will
get
if
you
wanted
it
to
go
to
the
grand
jury.”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes.”
the
court,
“you
have
signed
a
waiver
of
that
right,
am
i
right?”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes,
sir.”
there’s
no
indication
by
the
court
at
that
time
that
the
defendant
was
free
at
that
point
to
reconsider
his
waiver.
so,
the
whole
issue
of
waiver
introduced
by
the
trial
court
without
any
suggestion
that
prior
waivers
made
out
of
court
and
in
custody
can
be
reconsidered
and
then
the
court
addresses
the
critical
counsel
point.
the
court,
“in
addition,
you
are
entitled
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney
and
if
you
are
without
funds
with
which
to
employ
an
attorney,
the
court
will
appoint
one
for
you.
the
court
has
here
before
it
a
waiver
of
an
assignment
of
an
attorney.
is
it
your
wish
to
proceed
here
without
an
attorney?”
defendant
fontaine,
“i
guess
so.”
the
court,
“you
have
got
to
know
so.”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes
sir.”
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that
part
of
the
plea
proceeding
which
is
all
there
is,
on
the
question
of
the
waiver
of
counsel
is
deficient
in
multiple
respects.
first,
there
is
no
explanation
at
all
in
that
part
of
the
proceeding
or
anywhere
else,
as
to
what
a
guilty
plea
is,
what
rights
it
waives,
and
what
right
exists
to
plead
not
guilty.
under
boykin
against
alabama,
a
state
case,
but
decided
under
federal
constitutional
standards,
that
alone
is
sufficient
to
condemn
the
plea
and
force
vacation
of
this
conviction,
but
there’s
more.
the
court
gave
no
explanation
that
a
guilty
plea
does
not
entail
the
waiver
of
counsel.
indeed
the
opposite
impression
is
left
by
the
court’s
indication
that
you
have
got
to
know
that
you
want
to
waive
counsel.
i
don’t
suggest
that’s
the
only
implication
to
come
out
of
that
sentence,
but
it’s
a
fairly
likely
one.
and
a
layman
is
all
too
likely
to
consider
a
guilty
plea
as
the
equivalent
of
an
abandonment
of
the
lawyer.
the
lawyer
is
useful
for
the
fight
for
the
time
of
trial,
but
if
you’re
going
to
plead
guilty,
you
certainly
don’t
need
a
lawyer.
and
i
suggest,
in
order
to
correct
that
impression,
to
make
sure
that
an
understanding
and
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel
takes
place
is
the
obligation
of
the
court
accepting
a
guilty
plea
to
indicate
when
a
waiver
of
counsel
is
possible,
is
tendered
that
a
guilty
plea
does
not
entail
a
waiver,
nor
of
course
is
there
any
explanation
of
the
role
of
counsel
to
guilty
plea,
of
his
critical
role
in
plea
bargaining.
this
case
does
not
indicate
that
any
plea
bargaining
took
place,
indeed
the
sentence
of
20
years
with
a
maximum
25
suggest
it
didn’t.
and
there
were
also
lesser
included
offenses
to
federal
law
in
bank
robbery,
which
were
never
mentioned
by
the
court
and
which
could
be
very
vital
indeed
in
plea
bargaining.
the
absence
of
any
mention
of
lesser
included
offenses
is,
in
my
judgment,
sufficient
to
condemn
this
plea
under
mccarthy
against
the
united
states
where
this
court
did
not
quite
hold
that
lesser
included
offenses
had
to
be
mentioned
as
part
of
the
explanation
to
the
defendant
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
that
was
involved,
but
it
strongly
suggests
in
footnote
20
that
where
lesser
included
offenses
are
involved,
the
defendant
cannot
understand
the
nature
of
the
charge
without
being
told
about
it.
boykin
and
mccarthy
thus
far
condemn
the
plea,
but
there’s
still
more.
there
is
no
statement
by
this
court
that
the
court
thinks
that
counsel
would
be
desirable.
that
a
waiver
of
counsel
is
ordinarily
not
preferred.
indeed
as
this
court
has
put
it
on
many,
many
occasions,
every
presumption
is
indulged
against
waiver.
the
system
really
has
no
interest
in
an
un-counseled
guilty
plea
although
it
has
an
interest
guilty
pleas
generally.
nor
when
the
petitioner
indicated
that
he
had
guessed
he
did
not
want
to
proceed
with
a
lawyer,
did
the
court
take
any
concern
or
pains
to
clarify
that
ambiguous
rejection
to
indicate
at
that
point
that
he
was
offering
a
lawyer
for
this
plea,
to
do
anything
at
all
to
suggest
to
the
defendant
that
this
was
not
the
time
to
guess
about
whether
he
wanted
a
lawyer
or
not.
if
you’re
in
any
doubt
at
all,
the
court
advices
you
to
have
one,
instead
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
it
would
probably
be
fair
to
say,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
something
would
depend
on
how
--
what
kind
of
tone
of
voice
the
trial
judge
said,
“you
got
to
know
so.”
i
mean
if
he
said,
“you
got
to
know
so”
that
might
mean
to
a
defendant,
in
order
to
plead
guilty,
you
got
to
know
that
you
don’t
want
a
lawyer
which
indeed
would
be
the
common
sense
interpretation
that
a
layman
might
draw.
after
all,
i
don’t
need
a
lawyer
to
fight,
i’m
giving
up,
so
i
don’t
need
a
lawyer.
or
alternatively,
it
might
have
meant,
i
don’t
want
you
to
guess.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that’s
really
true
mr.
justice,
but
it’s
never
made
clear
that
powerfully
that
by
entitled
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney,
the
court
meant,
an
attorney
right
here
now,
at
this
guilty
plea.
an
implication
from
that
is,
if
you
want
to
go
forward
with
your
plea,
you’ve
got
to
know
that
you
don’t
want
a
lawyer.
if
you
want
to
go
to
trial,
then
you
want
--
then
you
may
want
a
lawyer.
now,
i
don’t
suggest,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that’s
the
only
interpretation
of
this
language.
i
suggest
that
when
solemn
occasion
of
a
guilty
plea
is
in
front
of
the
court,
there’s
no
room
for
ambiguity.
i
suggest
that
we
hark
back
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
black
in
johnson
against
zerbst
when
he
said
that
an
attendant
of
un-counseled
guilty
plea
presents
to
the
court
an
occasion
for
the
protection
of
the
court,
presents
to
the
court
an
occasion
at
which
the
court
has
to
take
the
greatest
care
that
an
un-counseled
guilty
plea
is
really
the
intelligent
desire
of
the
petitioner.
and
a
court
that
would
let
the
kind
of
colloquy
that
i’ve
read,
that
is
reflected
on
the
circuit
go
by
with
the
kind
of
ambiguities
that
ere
in
it,
i
suggest
to
you
is
not
the
sort
of
court
that
has
taken
the
kind
of
protection
to
see
to
it
that
the
defendant
understands
what
it
means
to
have
lawyer
at
a
guilty
plea
and
has
then
made
a
voluntary
rejection
of
it.
the
government’s
answers
to
these
arguments
consist
of
four.
that
there
was
an
offer
and
a
rejection
something
that
the
petitioner
does
not
challenge,
although
one
could
say
that
the
offer
wasn’t
all
that
clear
in
this
respect.
that
the
court
was
offering
a
lawyer
for
his
guilty
plea
proceeding
and
indeed
that
the
rejection
wasn’t
all
that
clear.
the
government
says
that
the
ambiguity
may
have
been
ambiguity
in
the
rejection,
i
guess
so,
may
have
been
cured
by
matters
of
tone
of
voice
at
the
pleading
and
i
don’t
doubt
that
either.
but
the
question
is
not
whether
there
was
simply
an
offer
and
an
equivocal
rejection,
although
i
suggest
that
this
court
should
require
absolutely
unequivocal
waivers
of
a
lawyer.
the
question
is
to
whether
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
they
are.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
that
the
description
of
the
crime
is
entirely
relevant
to
the
question
of
waiver
of
counsel
but
i
would
also
quarrel
with
the
suggestion
that
it
was
a
detailed
description
of
the
crime.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
for
the
question
of
whether
a
man
knows
whether
you
have
got
a
lawyer
or
not.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
not,
your
honor.
he
may
feel
that
he
held
up
a
bank
or
participated
in
holding
up
a
bank,
but
he
may
not
know
for
example
that
if
you
--
that
if
you
didn’t
have
the
gun,
you
might
be
chargeable
under
21-113
(a)
which
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
something
a
lawyer
could
help
him
with.
or
indeed,
if
you
just
leave
the
bank
with
someone
else’s
money,
you’d
be
chargeable
under
21-113
(c)
punishable
by
only
one
year
in
prison.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
he
never
specifically
says
he
had
a
gun
and
indeed
he
doesn’t
really
give
a
narrative
of
any
kind,
your
honor.
what
he
does
is
respond
to
the
court’s
questions.
“what
did
you
do
on
october
8?”
“i
held
the
bank
up.”
the
court,
“what?”
defendant
fontaine,
“i
held
up
a
teller.”
the
court,
“you
held
up
a
teller.”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes
sir.”
the
court,
“did
you
take
from
him
some
$1400
plus?”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes
sir.”
now,
that
is
certainly
an
acknowledgment
of
some
of
the
details
of
the
crime.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
though
it’s
the
kind
of
acknowledgment,
i
might
add,
that
you
would
expect
from
someone
who
was
coerced,
it's
the
response
to
fairly
abstract
questions
about
a
bank
robbery.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
don’t
see
that
question
here
your
honor
but
did
you
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
oh,
quite
right
and
by
the
use
of
the
gun
pistol,
right.
no,
i
don’t
mean
that
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
one
of
the
things
this
plea
proceeding
does
not
include
and
which
i
believe
is
in
response
to
your
question
also
is
that
federal
crime
requires
that
it'd
be
a
federal
bank
and
for
that
purpose
although
it
may
have
been
used
but
i
don’t
mean,
perhaps
i
should
recede
to
some
extent
from
the
notion
that
the
statement
of
what
you
did
on
a
given
day
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
your
need
for
a
counsel.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
don’t
question
it,
your
honor,
but
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
was
or
wasn’t
a
federal
bank.
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
suggest
that
it
was
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
federally
insured
bank,
right.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
suggesting
one
way
or
the
other,
no
mention
by
the
trial
court
of
that
issue
which
is
of
course
an
element
of
the
offense
and
since
it
was
not
mentioned
at
the
plea,
is
yet
another
basis
if
this
court
needs
one
to
condemn
this
case
and
this
plea
under
mccarthy
against
the
united
states.
it’s
a
rather
technical
basis
and
i
think
the
much
more
important
holding
of
this
court,
if
i
can
presume
to
suggest
one
is
that
waivers
of
counsel
obtained
in
district
court
ought
to
be
obtained
with
the
greatest
care
and
the
greatest
concern
that
a
defendant
understands
what
he’s
doing,
that
he
is
told
about
plea
bargaining.
that
he
is
told
what
the
elements
of
the
defense
are.
that
he
is
told
that
a
lawyer
can
be
very
useful
to
him
indeed
at
the
time
of
the
guilty
plea
and
that
the
court
is
absolutely
certain
that
the
defendant
understands
those
things
if
he
wishes
to
waive,
waive
a
lawyer.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
indeed,
it
would,
your
honor
because
that
language
suggests
that
the
defendant
may
have
confused
a
plea
of
guilty
with
a
plea
for
mercy.
the
state
of
his
mind
isn’t
entirely
clear
at
that
point
at
all
and
i
think
that
at
that
stage,
it
was
an
obligation
of
the
court
to
investigate
the
question
of
drugs
and
to
find
out,
for
example,
whether
this
defendant
was
mentally
incompetent
as
he
now
alleges
because
of
drugs.
instead,
the
court
with
characteristic
inattention
ignores
the
issue
altogether.
if
the
defendant
had
a
lawyer
at
that
point,
he
may
indeed
have
been
in
some,
“you
spoke
to
the
defendant
and
to
the
court
on
that
question.”
mr.
steven
m.
umin
only
the
abstract
statements
at
the
beginning
but
even
if
we
had
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
at
least
the
us
attorney
had
been
with
him.
i
presume
it’s
the
petitioner’s
allegation
that
the
waivers
were
signed
back
in
the
police
station
when
state
and
federal
police
were
really
--
even
if
we
had,
however,
the
clearest
kind
of
information
related
by
the
us
attorney
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
one-sided
plea
bargaining,
if
any
plea
bargaining
at
all.
even
if,
--
all
i
want
to
say
on
that
one
was
that
even
if--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
just
assumptions,
pardon
me?
mr.
steven
m.
umin
none
in
terms
of
plea
bargain.
there’s
something
in
the
record
suggesting
that
the
us
attorney
had
advised
him
of
certain
rights.
even
if
that
advice
had
been
given,
however,
this
court
has
never
accepted
non-advisory
advice
as
the
representation
of
counsel
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
as
against
california
being
a
instance
of
that.
the
petitioner
has
asked
the
court
to
vacate
the
guilty
plea
or
to
order
that
it'd
be
vacated
by
the
district
court
as
void
then
on
a
number
of
grounds.
first
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel,
that
this
record
does
not
disclose
any
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel
and
that
no
remand
is
required
for
that
purpose.
conley
and
boykin
standing
for
that
proposition.
second
that
the
nature
of
the
guilty
plea
was
inadequately
explained
and
that
boykin
alone
condemns
the
plea
on
that
ground.
thirdly,
that
for
technical,
and
if
you
will,
spiritual
reasons,
the
rule
11
was
not
complied
with
either
in
technical
sense
or
in
terms
of
its
spirit,
in
that
the
trial
court
failed
to
spell
out
fully
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
failed
to
inform
the
petitioner
the
lesser
included
offenses.
on
anyone
of
those
grounds,
this
court
should
remand
to
the
district
court
for
a
vacation
of
the
plea
without
further
evidentiary
hearing
if
however
all
of
--
pardon
me.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
he
alleges
that
he
was
not
your
honor
and
the
united
states
attorney
never
denied
it.
to
this
date
no
one
has
denied
that
he
was
never
taken
before
united
states
commissioner.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
don’t
know
what
happened.
the
record
does
not
illumine
how
he
got
from
his
home
on
october
21
to
the
courtroom
on
november
the
13th.
safe
to
say
that
he
alleges
continuous
custody,
abusive
continuous
custody,
never
got
before
a
magistrate
and
did
in
fact
appear
in
court
on
november
13,
a
period
of
some
three
weeks.
and
whether
he
was
bound
over
by
any
--
something
of
like
a
grand
jury,
we
know
that
he
waived
indictment.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
ultimately,
yes,
an
information
substituted
for
a
grand
jury
indictment.
so,
we
know
that
no
grand
jury
bound
him
over
and
there
has
been
no
denial
that
no
united
states
commissioner
bound
him
over
or
that
he
waived
either
grand
jury
indictment
or
preliminary
hearing.
so
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
point
whatsoever.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes.
but
no
indication
that
that
hospitalization
in
any
way
broke
the
custody
or
the
chain
of
coercion
which
he
alleges.
it’s
to
that
chain
of
coercion
that
i
would
now
turn
for
the
second
point
in
the
case
which
was
featured
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
may
have
been
the
reason
for
this
court’s
grant
of
it.
that
is
petitioner’s
contention
that
2255,
title
28
of
united
states
code
guarantees
him
an
evidentiary
hearing
upon
concrete
allegations
of
coercion
which
he
proved
would
show
that
his
guilty
plea
was
coerced
unless,
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
conclusively
show
that
he’s
not
entitled
to
such
a
hearing.
on
this
wing
of
the
argument,
let
me
make
clear
if
i
can
what
is
not
in
dispute.
it
is
not
in
dispute
here
that
petitioner’s
allegations
are
sufficient
to
show
coercion
to
be
true.
it
is
not
in
dispute
that
such
allegations
were
traditionally
heard
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
it
is
not
in
dispute
that
2255
and
its
conclusively
language
was
enacted
against
the
background
of
the
habeas
corpus
cases
and
carries
forward
the
understanding
of
those
cases.
the
cases
of
waley
against
johnston
and
walker
against
johnson
are
conspicuously
absent
from
the
government’s
brief
and
that
is
because
they
stand
for
the
proposition,
later
embodied
in
the
conclusively
language
that
a
trial
court
on
a
2255
motion
save
in
cases
of
inherent
incredibility,
it
has
no
credibility
function
to
perform
until
it
holds
an
evidentiary
hearing.
likewise,
it
is
not
in
dispute
that
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
2255,
in
machibroda
against
the
united
states,
in
sanders
against
the
united
states,
this
court
confirmed
that
save
for
cases
of
inherent
incredibility,
an
evidentiary
hearing
must
be
held
upon
allegations
which
are
sufficient
to
grant
relief.
nor
is
it
in
dispute
that
in
kaufman
against
united
states,
this
court
applied
townsend
in
the
same
criteria
to
the
question
of
when
an
evidentiary
hearing
should
be
held
and
indicated
that
those
criteria
were
fully
applicable
under
2255.
the
government’s
arguments
instead
to
justify
the
denial
of
the
hearing
in
this
case
are
two-fold.
first
that
by
participating
in
the
guilty
plea
proceeding,
in
alleged
conformity
with
rule
11
and
i
submit,
rule
11
was
not
complied
with,
the
petitioner
in
effect
forfeited
his
right
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
that
argument
has
two
principal
characteristics.
it’s
an
old
one
and
it’s
a
bad
one.
it’s
an
old
argument
because
it
wasn’t
advanced
in
substance
in
waley
against
johnston.
waley
who
was
represented
against
--
represented
by
counsel
had
a
guilty
plea,
later
alleged
that
he
had
been
coerced
to
plead.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
his
participation
of
the
plea
proceeding
with
counsel,
in
effect,
waived
his
right
later
to
attack
that
plea.
the
solicitor
general
at
that
point
confessed
error
and
this
court
held
that
if
the
coercion
was
sufficient
to
obtain
the
plea,
it
surely
is
sufficient
to
negate
any
suggestion
that
at
a
plea
proceeding,
the
petitioner
waived
his
right
later
to
attack
it.
so,
the
first
forfeiture
argument
is
an
old
argument
that
this
court
has
already
rejected.
the
second
argument,
it
is
likewise
a
poor
argument
i
would
suggest
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
it
ignores
that
petitioner
in
this
case,
although
he
did
participate
in
a
rule
11
proceeding
in
which
time
he
indicated
that
his
plea
was
voluntary,
has
alleged
that
in
fact,
he
was
coerced
to
plea
and
the
argument
of
the
government
ignores
that
the
coercion
alleged
applies
not
only
to
the
guilty
plead
itself
but
the
statements
made
thereafter,
including
the
statement
that
the
plea
was
voluntary.
the
government
suggests
that
in
certain
circumstances,
it
maybe
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
defendant
would
not
raise
the
issue
of
coercion
at
a
plea,
but
in
such
as
where
he
has
been
told
by
a
prosecutor
not
to
reveal
his
promises
to
judge
or
his
own
lawyers
such
as
machibroda.
but
in
the
ordinary
case,
when
a
defendant
participates
in
a
plea,
he
should
not
later
be
allowed
to
attack
the
plea
as
involuntary
if
he
didn’t
object
to
voluntariness
at
the
time
of
the
plea.
first
of
all,
this
petitioner
does
tender
the
allegation
that
the
police
coercion
extended
not
only
to
the
plea
itself
but
to
the
plea
proceedings
and
so
he
has
suggested
a
special
reason
for
not
having
mentioned
the
voluntariness
in
the
courtroom.
moreover,
however,
the
government’s
suggestion
that
participation
of
plea
proceeding
breaks
the
chain
of
coercion
in
effect
and
thus
ensures
that
a
statement
of
voluntariness
at
a
plea
proceeding
is
a
valid
one
which
cannot
later
be
attacked.
the
government’s
suggestion
that
the
chain
of
coercion
has
been
broken
by
that
kind
of
participation
in
the
plea
proceeding
assumes
the
very
question
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
designed
to
test.
whether
in
fact,
there
was
any
break
in
the
chain
of
alleged
coercion
if
coercion
did
in
fact
take
place.
whether
the
plea
proceeding
was
effective
in
enabling
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
say,
“no,
your
honor,
i
was
coerced.
it’s
not
voluntary.”
and
indeed,
certain
kinds
of
plea
proceedings
might
be
ones
which
this
court
could
trust
when
defendants
made
expressions
of
voluntariness
therein
as
being
the
kind
of
plea
proceeding
which
would
later
bar
him
from
attacking
the
plea
in
collaborating.
such
as
a
plea
proceeding
in
which
the
defendant
is
represented
by
counsel
or
a
plea
proceeding
in
which
the
rule
11
procedure
is
not
engaged
in
the
form
of
ritual
as
it
was
here,
but
is
a
genuine
inquiry
by
the
trial
court
into
the
nature
of
the
charge,
the
defendants
understanding
of
it
and
his
voluntary
participation
in
the
plea
proceeding.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
he
was,
your
honor.
that’s
not
a
new
circumstance
in
cases
under
2255.
in
machibroda
for
example,
the
same
judge
who
took
machibroda’s
plea
was
the
sentencing
judge
and
this
court
did
not
find
that
sufficient
to
enable
for
example
the
trial
judge
to
say,
“well,
i
saw
him
at
the
plea
and
i
know
it
was
voluntary.”
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it
does
not.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
it
frequently
is.
finally
the
government
argues
that
the
files
and
records
of
this
case
conclusively
show
in
effect
that
the
petitioner
was
a
liar
and
they
alleged
that
it
took
them
18
months
to
file
a
petition
under
2255.
he
also
filed
a
brief
of
law
in
conjunction
with
it.
he
was
26
years
old
at
the
time
and
it
might
take
someone
18
months
to
file
the
kind
of
brief
he
did
in
fact
filed.
the
government
alleges
that
in
exaggerating
his
illnesses
and
his
hospital
appearances,
the
petitioner
confused
one
hospital
record
with
another
as
if
to
say
no
evidentiary
hearing
is
necessary
because
the
hospital
records
refute
the
petitioner’s
claims.
the
hospital
records,
this
court
will
--i
submit
to
this
court,
should
be
investigated
quite
carefully
and
none
of
them
were
written
at
the
time
of
the
events
they
purport
to
describe.
the
first
one
three
days
after
the
petitioner
left
the
hospital,
the
second
one
three
months
after
the
petitioner
left
the
hospital.
so
that
for
example,
it
is
no
indication
of
the
petitioner’s
incredibility
whatsoever
that
his
first
hospital
record
does
not
show
as
he
alleged
that
he’d
bled
from
a
gun
wound.
it
does
show
that
he
had
a
gun
wound,
a
gun
wound.
it
does
not
indicate
that
he
arrived
at
the
hospital
bleeding.
but
the
record
itself
does
not
show
that
the
person
who
wrote
it,
three
days
after,
not
after
the
petitioner
arrived
at
the
hospital
but
three
days
after
he
left
the
hospital
was
even
the
doctor
who
examined
him
first
and
therefore
would’ve
been
in
the
position
to
check
a
matter
like
whether
his
wound
was
bleeding.
thirdly,
the
government
suggests
that
the
petitioner
admitted
guilt
at
sentencing
and
indeed
he
did
so
but
he
alleges
that
not
merely
as
plea
of
guilty
but
his
admissions
at
the
plea
were
coerced.
and
finally,
the
government
says
that
his
allegation
that
he
didn’t
understand
the
jargon
at
the
plea
proceeding
is
absurd
because
the
government
--
because
the
court
used
only
simple
terms
like
banks,
guns,
etcetera.
the
court
also
used
some
not
simple
terms
like
waiver,
a
term
that
the
government
fails
to
include
in
its
list
of
simple
terms
and
to
the
extent
indeed
that
it
explained
waiver,
it
explained
it
wrongfully.
and
indeed,
the
government's
argument
on
the
jargon
gets
us
back
to
what
i
do
believe
is
in
fact
the
main
issue
in
this
case,
that
there
was
no
valid
guilty
plea
under
boykin
against
alabama,
that
there
was
no
valid
guilty
plea
under
mccarthy
against
the
united
states
and
that
there
was
--
and
that
this
record
does
not
disclose
an
understanding
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel
as
this
court’s
cases
from
johnson
against
zerbst
to
carnley
required.
accordingly,
this
court
should
remand
to
the
district
court
with
directions
to
vacate
the
guilty
plea
without
further
evidentiary
hearing
or
in
the
alternative
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
thank
you.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i’ll
do
my
best,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
challenges
the
validity
of
a
guilty
plea,
federal
armed
bank
robbery,
entered
by
the
petitioner
david
x.
fontaine
in
federal
court
in
november
of
1969.
the
issues
that
the
case
raises
were
each
presented
pro
se
by
mr.
fontaine
in
his
motion
to
vacate
sentence
under
28
u.s.c.
2255
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i'll
indulge
in
some
oversimplification
initially
and
define
those
issues
as
follows.
first,
whether
2255
entitled
the
petitioner
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
upon
his
concrete
allegations
which
he
had
threw
--
which
show
that
his
guilty
plea
was
coerced.
and
second
and
even
more
important,
i
would
suggest,
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
petitioner’s
guilty
plea
is
void
on
the
face
of
the
existing
record,
without
further
evidentiary
hearing,
for
want
of
a
valid
sixth
amendment
waiver
of
counsel.
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
is
the
history
of
inattention
to
to
detail.
in
the
face
of
the
petitioner’s
concrete
allegations,
the
police’s
physical
and
mental
abuse,
united
states
attorney
declined
even
to
answer
those
specific
allegations.
the
district
court
nonetheless
denied
the
petitioner’s
claims
summarily
without
a
hearing,
his
waiver
of
counsel
points
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioner
had
participated
in
a
rule
11
proceeding
at
guilty
plea
and
his
voluntariness
claim
on
the
same
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
typical
of
the
inattention
paid
to
this
case,
affirmed
the
summary
denial
below
in
one
sentence
and
that
sentence
contained
an
error,
an
error
dealing
with
the
ground
of
decision
by
the
district
court.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
appointed
counsel.
i
mentioned
the
appointment
only
to
highlight
that
the
absence
of
counsel
at
all
prior
stages
of
this
case
and
most
particularly
at
the
guilty
plea
itself
is
the
critical
fact
at
hand.
from
arrest
through
custody,
through
plea
and
sentencing,
the
absence
of
counsel
raises
the
federal
issue
whether
this
record,
the
existing
record
made
at
the
guilty
plea,
discloses
a
waiver
of
counsel
compatible
with
the
sixth
amendment
standards.
the
issue
must
be
framed
precisely.
this
is
not
a
question
of
whether
at
a
guilty
plea
proceeding
there
was
an
offer
of
counsel
and
a
rejection
of
counsel.
we
can
argue
about
that.
i
do
believe
that
the
record
shows
something
resembling
an
offer
and
something
resembling
a
rejection.
but
the
question
is
whether
even
if
there
was
a
meaningful
offer
of
counsel
and
an
offer
of
reject
--
and
a
rejection
of
counsel,
the
circumstances
of
that
offer
and
rejection
disclose
an
understanding
and
intelligent
waiver
under
the
sixth
amendment.
to
quote
from
carnley
against
cochran,
“in
the
absence
of
an
understanding
of
an
intelligent
waiver
anything
less
is
not
waiver.”
let
me
say
one
word
if
i
may
about
the
position
of
that
issue
in
this
case.
it
stands
as
point
number
four
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
on
page
47.
in
my
judgment
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
it
to
the
court,
it’s
point
number
one
in
the
case.
so,
i’m
something
in
the
position
of
a
college
debater
that
i
once
heard
who
perhaps
over-tied
to
the
structure
of
his
own
argument,
had
to
begin
by
announcing
to
his
audience
that
i
have
four
points
to
make,
let
me
make
the
fourth
one
first.
the
waiver
of
counsel
point
is
indeed
number
four
in
the
brief,
but
it’s
number
one
the
case.
let
me
turn
to
the
facts
that
surround
the
waiver
of
counsel
point,
making
two
things
clear
at
the
outset.
absolutely
nothing
about
that
point
depends
upon
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
petitioner’s
allegations
pertaining
to
police
abuse
or
coercion.
likewise,
absolutely
nothing
about
the
waiver
of
counsel
claim
depends
upon
the
trial
court’s
alleged
compliance
with
the
rule
11
at
the
guilty
plea
proceeding.
the
waiver
of
counsel
point
depends
entirely
upon
the
record
made
at
that
proceeding
for
it’s
the
record
which
must
disclose
whether
there
was
not
merely
an
offer
and
rejection
of
counsel
but
an
understanding,
an
intelligent
one.
it
is
the
record
to
which
johnson
against
zerbst,
carnley
against
cochran
and
boykin
against
alabama
refers.
that
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
arrested
on
october
21,
1969.
that
with
the
exception
of
a
hospitalization
he
was
in
continuous
custody.
it
is
un-denied
on
the
record
that
he
was
never
arraigned
at
which
time
he
might
have
been
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel.
even
those
facts
are
strictly
speaking
irrelevant.
the
first
fact
which
is
critical
is
that
during
his
custody,
he
signed
two
pieces
of
paper,
alleged
waivers
of
grand
jury
indictment
and
counsel.
and
on
november
13,
he
came
to
court
in
the
company
of
united
states
attorney
without
a
lawyer
and
the
plea
proceeding
took
place.
i
could
read
all
of
that
proceeding
to
this
court
in
approximately
four
minutes
at
a
reasonable
pace.
doubling
the
time,
let’s
assume
that
plea
proceeding
took
eight
minutes
in
federal
court.
there
is
of
course
no
time
requirement
on
a
guilty
plea
proceeding
but
i
would
submit
that
it
is
some
index,
the
brevity
of
this
proceeding
is
some
index
of
the
care
and
attention
that
was
paid
to
the
plea
proceeding
as
a
whole
and
to
the
question
of
the
waiver
of
counsel,
and
i
would
read
for
you
only
that
part
of
the
proceeding
which
deals
with
the
waiver
of
counsel,
the
very
beginning
of
it
and
i’ll
be
very
brief.
the
united
states
attorney
on
page
3
of
the
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
mr.
zanglin
(ph)
begins,
“your
honor,
this
is
an
arraignment
on
an
information
charging
the
defendant
with
armed
bank
robbery.
he’s
been
given
a
copy
of
the
information.
he
acknowledges
that
he
understands
it
and
knows
what
the
maximum
penalty
is.
i
have
explained
to
him
his
right
to
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury.
he
has
waived
that
right
and
signed
a
waiver
of
rights
form.
he
understands
that
he
has
a
right
for
an
attorney
at
this
time
and
informs
me
that
he
wants
to
waive
that
right
and
has
signed
the
waiver
of
that
right.
knowing
all
of
these
rights,
he
informs
me
he
intends
to
plead
guilty
of
the
information.”
the
court,
“you
are
mr.
david
fontaine?”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes
sir.”
the
court,
“did
you
ever
receive
the
copy
of
the
information
here,
the
charge
against
you
for
armed
bank
robbery,
is
that
right?”
defendant
fontaine,
“right.”
the
court,
“the
first
thing
of
consequence
is
that
you
have
signed
also
a
waiver
of
grand
jury
indictment
which
means
you
are
entitled
to
have
this
matter
first
submitted
to
a
grand
jury
and
a
determination
made
by
that
body
and
an
indictment
returned
first.”
if
the
court
please,
may
i
pause
there
to
indicate
that
the
trial
court
in
accepting
a
plea
first
emphasizes
the
waiver
of
grand
jury
indictment
out
of
court
and
then
to
the
extent
that
it
defines
waiver
at
all
defines
it
exactly
erroneously.
a
waiver
of
a
grand
jury
indictment
does
not
mean
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
this
matter
first
submitted
to
as
grand
jury.
it
means
exactly
the
opposite
of
that.
the
court
then
continues,
“do
you
understand
that
the
rights
you
have
there
under?
anyway,
that’s
what
you
will
get
if
you
wanted
it
to
go
to
the
grand
jury.”
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
not,
your
honor
because
all
the
court
does
is
ask
the
defendant,
do
you
understand
that
and
the
rights
you
have
there
under?
if
he
understood
that,
that
definition
of
waiver,
he
would
be
understanding
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
waiver
was.
anyway,
the
court
says,
“that’s
what
you
will
get
if
you
wanted
it
to
go
to
the
grand
jury.”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes.”
the
court,
“you
have
signed
a
waiver
of
that
right,
am
i
right?”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes,
sir.”
there’s
no
indication
by
the
court
at
that
time
that
the
defendant
was
free
at
that
point
to
reconsider
his
waiver.
so,
the
whole
issue
of
waiver
introduced
by
the
trial
court
without
any
suggestion
that
prior
waivers
made
out
of
court
and
in
custody
can
be
reconsidered
and
then
the
court
addresses
the
critical
counsel
point.
the
court,
“in
addition,
you
are
entitled
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney
and
if
you
are
without
funds
with
which
to
employ
an
attorney,
the
court
will
appoint
one
for
you.
the
court
has
here
before
it
a
waiver
of
an
assignment
of
an
attorney.
is
it
your
wish
to
proceed
here
without
an
attorney?”
defendant
fontaine,
“i
guess
so.”
the
court,
“you
have
got
to
know
so.”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes
sir.”
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that
part
of
the
plea
proceeding
which
is
all
there
is,
on
the
question
of
the
waiver
of
counsel
is
deficient
in
multiple
respects.
first,
there
is
no
explanation
at
all
in
that
part
of
the
proceeding
or
anywhere
else,
as
to
what
a
guilty
plea
is,
what
rights
it
waives,
and
what
right
exists
to
plead
not
guilty.
under
boykin
against
alabama,
a
state
case,
but
decided
under
federal
constitutional
standards,
that
alone
is
sufficient
to
condemn
the
plea
and
force
vacation
of
this
conviction,
but
there’s
more.
the
court
gave
no
explanation
that
a
guilty
plea
does
not
entail
the
waiver
of
counsel.
indeed
the
opposite
impression
is
left
by
the
court’s
indication
that
you
have
got
to
know
that
you
want
to
waive
counsel.
i
don’t
suggest
that’s
the
only
implication
to
come
out
of
that
sentence,
but
it’s
a
fairly
likely
one.
and
a
layman
is
all
too
likely
to
consider
a
guilty
plea
as
the
equivalent
of
an
abandonment
of
the
lawyer.
the
lawyer
is
useful
for
the
fight
for
the
time
of
trial,
but
if
you’re
going
to
plead
guilty,
you
certainly
don’t
need
a
lawyer.
and
i
suggest,
in
order
to
correct
that
impression,
to
make
sure
that
an
understanding
and
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel
takes
place
is
the
obligation
of
the
court
accepting
a
guilty
plea
to
indicate
when
a
waiver
of
counsel
is
possible,
is
tendered
that
a
guilty
plea
does
not
entail
a
waiver,
nor
of
course
is
there
any
explanation
of
the
role
of
counsel
to
guilty
plea,
of
his
critical
role
in
plea
bargaining.
this
case
does
not
indicate
that
any
plea
bargaining
took
place,
indeed
the
sentence
of
20
years
with
a
maximum
25
suggest
it
didn’t.
and
there
were
also
lesser
included
offenses
to
federal
law
in
bank
robbery,
which
were
never
mentioned
by
the
court
and
which
could
be
very
vital
indeed
in
plea
bargaining.
the
absence
of
any
mention
of
lesser
included
offenses
is,
in
my
judgment,
sufficient
to
condemn
this
plea
under
mccarthy
against
the
united
states
where
this
court
did
not
quite
hold
that
lesser
included
offenses
had
to
be
mentioned
as
part
of
the
explanation
to
the
defendant
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
that
was
involved,
but
it
strongly
suggests
in
footnote
20
that
where
lesser
included
offenses
are
involved,
the
defendant
cannot
understand
the
nature
of
the
charge
without
being
told
about
it.
boykin
and
mccarthy
thus
far
condemn
the
plea,
but
there’s
still
more.
there
is
no
statement
by
this
court
that
the
court
thinks
that
counsel
would
be
desirable.
that
a
waiver
of
counsel
is
ordinarily
not
preferred.
indeed
as
this
court
has
put
it
on
many,
many
occasions,
every
presumption
is
indulged
against
waiver.
the
system
really
has
no
interest
in
an
un-counseled
guilty
plea
although
it
has
an
interest
guilty
pleas
generally.
nor
when
the
petitioner
indicated
that
he
had
guessed
he
did
not
want
to
proceed
with
a
lawyer,
did
the
court
take
any
concern
or
pains
to
clarify
that
ambiguous
rejection
to
indicate
at
that
point
that
he
was
offering
a
lawyer
for
this
plea,
to
do
anything
at
all
to
suggest
to
the
defendant
that
this
was
not
the
time
to
guess
about
whether
he
wanted
a
lawyer
or
not.
if
you’re
in
any
doubt
at
all,
the
court
advices
you
to
have
one,
instead
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
it
would
probably
be
fair
to
say,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
something
would
depend
on
how
--
what
kind
of
tone
of
voice
the
trial
judge
said,
“you
got
to
know
so.”
i
mean
if
he
said,
“you
got
to
know
so”
that
might
mean
to
a
defendant,
in
order
to
plead
guilty,
you
got
to
know
that
you
don’t
want
a
lawyer
which
indeed
would
be
the
common
sense
interpretation
that
a
layman
might
draw.
after
all,
i
don’t
need
a
lawyer
to
fight,
i’m
giving
up,
so
i
don’t
need
a
lawyer.
or
alternatively,
it
might
have
meant,
i
don’t
want
you
to
guess.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
that’s
really
true
mr.
justice,
but
it’s
never
made
clear
that
powerfully
that
by
entitled
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney,
the
court
meant,
an
attorney
right
here
now,
at
this
guilty
plea.
an
implication
from
that
is,
if
you
want
to
go
forward
with
your
plea,
you’ve
got
to
know
that
you
don’t
want
a
lawyer.
if
you
want
to
go
to
trial,
then
you
want
--
then
you
may
want
a
lawyer.
now,
i
don’t
suggest,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that’s
the
only
interpretation
of
this
language.
i
suggest
that
when
solemn
occasion
of
a
guilty
plea
is
in
front
of
the
court,
there’s
no
room
for
ambiguity.
i
suggest
that
we
hark
back
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
black
in
johnson
against
zerbst
when
he
said
that
an
attendant
of
un-counseled
guilty
plea
presents
to
the
court
an
occasion
for
the
protection
of
the
court,
presents
to
the
court
an
occasion
at
which
the
court
has
to
take
the
greatest
care
that
an
un-counseled
guilty
plea
is
really
the
intelligent
desire
of
the
petitioner.
and
a
court
that
would
let
the
kind
of
colloquy
that
i’ve
read,
that
is
reflected
on
the
circuit
go
by
with
the
kind
of
ambiguities
that
ere
in
it,
i
suggest
to
you
is
not
the
sort
of
court
that
has
taken
the
kind
of
protection
to
see
to
it
that
the
defendant
understands
what
it
means
to
have
lawyer
at
a
guilty
plea
and
has
then
made
a
voluntary
rejection
of
it.
the
government’s
answers
to
these
arguments
consist
of
four.
that
there
was
an
offer
and
a
rejection
something
that
the
petitioner
does
not
challenge,
although
one
could
say
that
the
offer
wasn’t
all
that
clear
in
this
respect.
that
the
court
was
offering
a
lawyer
for
his
guilty
plea
proceeding
and
indeed
that
the
rejection
wasn’t
all
that
clear.
the
government
says
that
the
ambiguity
may
have
been
ambiguity
in
the
rejection,
i
guess
so,
may
have
been
cured
by
matters
of
tone
of
voice
at
the
pleading
and
i
don’t
doubt
that
either.
but
the
question
is
not
whether
there
was
simply
an
offer
and
an
equivocal
rejection,
although
i
suggest
that
this
court
should
require
absolutely
unequivocal
waivers
of
a
lawyer.
the
question
is
to
whether
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
they
are.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
that
the
description
of
the
crime
is
entirely
relevant
to
the
question
of
waiver
of
counsel
but
i
would
also
quarrel
with
the
suggestion
that
it
was
a
detailed
description
of
the
crime.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
for
the
question
of
whether
a
man
knows
whether
you
have
got
a
lawyer
or
not.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
not,
your
honor.
he
may
feel
that
he
held
up
a
bank
or
participated
in
holding
up
a
bank,
but
he
may
not
know
for
example
that
if
you
--
that
if
you
didn’t
have
the
gun,
you
might
be
chargeable
under
21-113
(a)
which
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
something
a
lawyer
could
help
him
with.
or
indeed,
if
you
just
leave
the
bank
with
someone
else’s
money,
you’d
be
chargeable
under
21-113
(c)
punishable
by
only
one
year
in
prison.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
he
never
specifically
says
he
had
a
gun
and
indeed
he
doesn’t
really
give
a
narrative
of
any
kind,
your
honor.
what
he
does
is
respond
to
the
court’s
questions.
“what
did
you
do
on
october
8?”
“i
held
the
bank
up.”
the
court,
“what?”
defendant
fontaine,
“i
held
up
a
teller.”
the
court,
“you
held
up
a
teller.”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes
sir.”
the
court,
“did
you
take
from
him
some
$1400
plus?”
defendant
fontaine,
“yes
sir.”
now,
that
is
certainly
an
acknowledgment
of
some
of
the
details
of
the
crime.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
though
it’s
the
kind
of
acknowledgment,
i
might
add,
that
you
would
expect
from
someone
who
was
coerced,
it's
the
response
to
fairly
abstract
questions
about
a
bank
robbery.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
don’t
see
that
question
here
your
honor
but
did
you
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
oh,
quite
right
and
by
the
use
of
the
gun
pistol,
right.
no,
i
don’t
mean
that
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
one
of
the
things
this
plea
proceeding
does
not
include
and
which
i
believe
is
in
response
to
your
question
also
is
that
federal
crime
requires
that
it'd
be
a
federal
bank
and
for
that
purpose
although
it
may
have
been
used
but
i
don’t
mean,
perhaps
i
should
recede
to
some
extent
from
the
notion
that
the
statement
of
what
you
did
on
a
given
day
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
your
need
for
a
counsel.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
don’t
question
it,
your
honor,
but
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
was
or
wasn’t
a
federal
bank.
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
suggest
that
it
was
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
federally
insured
bank,
right.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
suggesting
one
way
or
the
other,
no
mention
by
the
trial
court
of
that
issue
which
is
of
course
an
element
of
the
offense
and
since
it
was
not
mentioned
at
the
plea,
is
yet
another
basis
if
this
court
needs
one
to
condemn
this
case
and
this
plea
under
mccarthy
against
the
united
states.
it’s
a
rather
technical
basis
and
i
think
the
much
more
important
holding
of
this
court,
if
i
can
presume
to
suggest
one
is
that
waivers
of
counsel
obtained
in
district
court
ought
to
be
obtained
with
the
greatest
care
and
the
greatest
concern
that
a
defendant
understands
what
he’s
doing,
that
he
is
told
about
plea
bargaining.
that
he
is
told
what
the
elements
of
the
defense
are.
that
he
is
told
that
a
lawyer
can
be
very
useful
to
him
indeed
at
the
time
of
the
guilty
plea
and
that
the
court
is
absolutely
certain
that
the
defendant
understands
those
things
if
he
wishes
to
waive,
waive
a
lawyer.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
indeed,
it
would,
your
honor
because
that
language
suggests
that
the
defendant
may
have
confused
a
plea
of
guilty
with
a
plea
for
mercy.
the
state
of
his
mind
isn’t
entirely
clear
at
that
point
at
all
and
i
think
that
at
that
stage,
it
was
an
obligation
of
the
court
to
investigate
the
question
of
drugs
and
to
find
out,
for
example,
whether
this
defendant
was
mentally
incompetent
as
he
now
alleges
because
of
drugs.
instead,
the
court
with
characteristic
inattention
ignores
the
issue
altogether.
if
the
defendant
had
a
lawyer
at
that
point,
he
may
indeed
have
been
in
some,
“you
spoke
to
the
defendant
and
to
the
court
on
that
question.”
mr.
steven
m.
umin
only
the
abstract
statements
at
the
beginning
but
even
if
we
had
--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
at
least
the
us
attorney
had
been
with
him.
i
presume
it’s
the
petitioner’s
allegation
that
the
waivers
were
signed
back
in
the
police
station
when
state
and
federal
police
were
really
--
even
if
we
had,
however,
the
clearest
kind
of
information
related
by
the
us
attorney
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
one-sided
plea
bargaining,
if
any
plea
bargaining
at
all.
even
if,
--
all
i
want
to
say
on
that
one
was
that
even
if--
mr.
steven
m.
umin
just
assumptions,
pardon
me?
mr.
steven
m.
umin
none
in
terms
of
plea
bargain.
there’s
something
in
the
record
suggesting
that
the
us
attorney
had
advised
him
of
certain
rights.
even
if
that
advice
had
been
given,
however,
this
court
has
never
accepted
non-advisory
advice
as
the
representation
of
counsel
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
as
against
california
being
a
instance
of
that.
the
petitioner
has
asked
the
court
to
vacate
the
guilty
plea
or
to
order
that
it'd
be
vacated
by
the
district
court
as
void
then
on
a
number
of
grounds.
first
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel,
that
this
record
does
not
disclose
any
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel
and
that
no
remand
is
required
for
that
purpose.
conley
and
boykin
standing
for
that
proposition.
second
that
the
nature
of
the
guilty
plea
was
inadequately
explained
and
that
boykin
alone
condemns
the
plea
on
that
ground.
thirdly,
that
for
technical,
and
if
you
will,
spiritual
reasons,
the
rule
11
was
not
complied
with
either
in
technical
sense
or
in
terms
of
its
spirit,
in
that
the
trial
court
failed
to
spell
out
fully
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
failed
to
inform
the
petitioner
the
lesser
included
offenses.
on
anyone
of
those
grounds,
this
court
should
remand
to
the
district
court
for
a
vacation
of
the
plea
without
further
evidentiary
hearing
if
however
all
of
--
pardon
me.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
he
alleges
that
he
was
not
your
honor
and
the
united
states
attorney
never
denied
it.
to
this
date
no
one
has
denied
that
he
was
never
taken
before
united
states
commissioner.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
don’t
know
what
happened.
the
record
does
not
illumine
how
he
got
from
his
home
on
october
21
to
the
courtroom
on
november
the
13th.
safe
to
say
that
he
alleges
continuous
custody,
abusive
continuous
custody,
never
got
before
a
magistrate
and
did
in
fact
appear
in
court
on
november
13,
a
period
of
some
three
weeks.
and
whether
he
was
bound
over
by
any
--
something
of
like
a
grand
jury,
we
know
that
he
waived
indictment.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
ultimately,
yes,
an
information
substituted
for
a
grand
jury
indictment.
so,
we
know
that
no
grand
jury
bound
him
over
and
there
has
been
no
denial
that
no
united
states
commissioner
bound
him
over
or
that
he
waived
either
grand
jury
indictment
or
preliminary
hearing.
so
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
point
whatsoever.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes.
but
no
indication
that
that
hospitalization
in
any
way
broke
the
custody
or
the
chain
of
coercion
which
he
alleges.
it’s
to
that
chain
of
coercion
that
i
would
now
turn
for
the
second
point
in
the
case
which
was
featured
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
may
have
been
the
reason
for
this
court’s
grant
of
it.
that
is
petitioner’s
contention
that
2255,
title
28
of
united
states
code
guarantees
him
an
evidentiary
hearing
upon
concrete
allegations
of
coercion
which
he
proved
would
show
that
his
guilty
plea
was
coerced
unless,
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
conclusively
show
that
he’s
not
entitled
to
such
a
hearing.
on
this
wing
of
the
argument,
let
me
make
clear
if
i
can
what
is
not
in
dispute.
it
is
not
in
dispute
here
that
petitioner’s
allegations
are
sufficient
to
show
coercion
to
be
true.
it
is
not
in
dispute
that
such
allegations
were
traditionally
heard
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
it
is
not
in
dispute
that
2255
and
its
conclusively
language
was
enacted
against
the
background
of
the
habeas
corpus
cases
and
carries
forward
the
understanding
of
those
cases.
the
cases
of
waley
against
johnston
and
walker
against
johnson
are
conspicuously
absent
from
the
government’s
brief
and
that
is
because
they
stand
for
the
proposition,
later
embodied
in
the
conclusively
language
that
a
trial
court
on
a
2255
motion
save
in
cases
of
inherent
incredibility,
it
has
no
credibility
function
to
perform
until
it
holds
an
evidentiary
hearing.
likewise,
it
is
not
in
dispute
that
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
2255,
in
machibroda
against
the
united
states,
in
sanders
against
the
united
states,
this
court
confirmed
that
save
for
cases
of
inherent
incredibility,
an
evidentiary
hearing
must
be
held
upon
allegations
which
are
sufficient
to
grant
relief.
nor
is
it
in
dispute
that
in
kaufman
against
united
states,
this
court
applied
townsend
in
the
same
criteria
to
the
question
of
when
an
evidentiary
hearing
should
be
held
and
indicated
that
those
criteria
were
fully
applicable
under
2255.
the
government’s
arguments
instead
to
justify
the
denial
of
the
hearing
in
this
case
are
two-fold.
first
that
by
participating
in
the
guilty
plea
proceeding,
in
alleged
conformity
with
rule
11
and
i
submit,
rule
11
was
not
complied
with,
the
petitioner
in
effect
forfeited
his
right
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
that
argument
has
two
principal
characteristics.
it’s
an
old
one
and
it’s
a
bad
one.
it’s
an
old
argument
because
it
wasn’t
advanced
in
substance
in
waley
against
johnston.
waley
who
was
represented
against
--
represented
by
counsel
had
a
guilty
plea,
later
alleged
that
he
had
been
coerced
to
plead.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
his
participation
of
the
plea
proceeding
with
counsel,
in
effect,
waived
his
right
later
to
attack
that
plea.
the
solicitor
general
at
that
point
confessed
error
and
this
court
held
that
if
the
coercion
was
sufficient
to
obtain
the
plea,
it
surely
is
sufficient
to
negate
any
suggestion
that
at
a
plea
proceeding,
the
petitioner
waived
his
right
later
to
attack
it.
so,
the
first
forfeiture
argument
is
an
old
argument
that
this
court
has
already
rejected.
the
second
argument,
it
is
likewise
a
poor
argument
i
would
suggest
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
it
ignores
that
petitioner
in
this
case,
although
he
did
participate
in
a
rule
11
proceeding
in
which
time
he
indicated
that
his
plea
was
voluntary,
has
alleged
that
in
fact,
he
was
coerced
to
plea
and
the
argument
of
the
government
ignores
that
the
coercion
alleged
applies
not
only
to
the
guilty
plead
itself
but
the
statements
made
thereafter,
including
the
statement
that
the
plea
was
voluntary.
the
government
suggests
that
in
certain
circumstances,
it
maybe
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
defendant
would
not
raise
the
issue
of
coercion
at
a
plea,
but
in
such
as
where
he
has
been
told
by
a
prosecutor
not
to
reveal
his
promises
to
judge
or
his
own
lawyers
such
as
machibroda.
but
in
the
ordinary
case,
when
a
defendant
participates
in
a
plea,
he
should
not
later
be
allowed
to
attack
the
plea
as
involuntary
if
he
didn’t
object
to
voluntariness
at
the
time
of
the
plea.
first
of
all,
this
petitioner
does
tender
the
allegation
that
the
police
coercion
extended
not
only
to
the
plea
itself
but
to
the
plea
proceedings
and
so
he
has
suggested
a
special
reason
for
not
having
mentioned
the
voluntariness
in
the
courtroom.
moreover,
however,
the
government’s
suggestion
that
participation
of
plea
proceeding
breaks
the
chain
of
coercion
in
effect
and
thus
ensures
that
a
statement
of
voluntariness
at
a
plea
proceeding
is
a
valid
one
which
cannot
later
be
attacked.
the
government’s
suggestion
that
the
chain
of
coercion
has
been
broken
by
that
kind
of
participation
in
the
plea
proceeding
assumes
the
very
question
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
designed
to
test.
whether
in
fact,
there
was
any
break
in
the
chain
of
alleged
coercion
if
coercion
did
in
fact
take
place.
whether
the
plea
proceeding
was
effective
in
enabling
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
say,
“no,
your
honor,
i
was
coerced.
it’s
not
voluntary.”
and
indeed,
certain
kinds
of
plea
proceedings
might
be
ones
which
this
court
could
trust
when
defendants
made
expressions
of
voluntariness
therein
as
being
the
kind
of
plea
proceeding
which
would
later
bar
him
from
attacking
the
plea
in
collaborating.
such
as
a
plea
proceeding
in
which
the
defendant
is
represented
by
counsel
or
a
plea
proceeding
in
which
the
rule
11
procedure
is
not
engaged
in
the
form
of
ritual
as
it
was
here,
but
is
a
genuine
inquiry
by
the
trial
court
into
the
nature
of
the
charge,
the
defendants
understanding
of
it
and
his
voluntary
participation
in
the
plea
proceeding.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
yes,
he
was,
your
honor.
that’s
not
a
new
circumstance
in
cases
under
2255.
in
machibroda
for
example,
the
same
judge
who
took
machibroda’s
plea
was
the
sentencing
judge
and
this
court
did
not
find
that
sufficient
to
enable
for
example
the
trial
judge
to
say,
“well,
i
saw
him
at
the
plea
and
i
know
it
was
voluntary.”
mr.
steven
m.
umin
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it
does
not.
mr.
steven
m.
umin
i
think
it
frequently
is.
finally
the
government
argues
that
the
files
and
records
of
this
case
conclusively
show
in
effect
that
the
petitioner
was
a
liar
and
they
alleged
that
it
took
them
18
months
to
file
a
petition
under
2255.
he
also
filed
a
brief
of
law
in
conjunction
with
it.
he
was
26
years
old
at
the
time
and
it
might
take
someone
18
months
to
file
the
kind
of
brief
he
did
in
fact
filed.
the
government
alleges
that
in
exaggerating
his
illnesses
and
his
hospital
appearances,
the
petitioner
confused
one
hospital
record
with
another
as
if
to
say
no
evidentiary
hearing
is
necessary
because
the
hospital
records
refute
the
petitioner’s
claims.
the
hospital
records,
this
court
will
--i
submit
to
this
court,
should
be
investigated
quite
carefully
and
none
of
them
were
written
at
the
time
of
the
events
they
purport
to
describe.
the
first
one
three
days
after
the
petitioner
left
the
hospital,
the
second
one
three
months
after
the
petitioner
left
the
hospital.
so
that
for
example,
it
is
no
indication
of
the
petitioner’s
incredibility
whatsoever
that
his
first
hospital
record
does
not
show
as
he
alleged
that
he’d
bled
from
a
gun
wound.
it
does
show
that
he
had
a
gun
wound,
a
gun
wound.
it
does
not
indicate
that
he
arrived
at
the
hospital
bleeding.
but
the
record
itself
does
not
show
that
the
person
who
wrote
it,
three
days
after,
not
after
the
petitioner
arrived
at
the
hospital
but
three
days
after
he
left
the
hospital
was
even
the
doctor
who
examined
him
first
and
therefore
would’ve
been
in
the
position
to
check
a
matter
like
whether
his
wound
was
bleeding.
thirdly,
the
government
suggests
that
the
petitioner
admitted
guilt
at
sentencing
and
indeed
he
did
so
but
he
alleges
that
not
merely
as
plea
of
guilty
but
his
admissions
at
the
plea
were
coerced.
and
finally,
the
government
says
that
his
allegation
that
he
didn’t
understand
the
jargon
at
the
plea
proceeding
is
absurd
because
the
government
--
because
the
court
used
only
simple
terms
like
banks,
guns,
etcetera.
the
court
also
used
some
not
simple
terms
like
waiver,
a
term
that
the
government
fails
to
include
in
its
list
of
simple
terms
and
to
the
extent
indeed
that
it
explained
waiver,
it
explained
it
wrongfully.
and
indeed,
the
government's
argument
on
the
jargon
gets
us
back
to
what
i
do
believe
is
in
fact
the
main
issue
in
this
case,
that
there
was
no
valid
guilty
plea
under
boykin
against
alabama,
that
there
was
no
valid
guilty
plea
under
mccarthy
against
the
united
states
and
that
there
was
--
and
that
this
record
does
not
disclose
an
understanding
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel
as
this
court’s
cases
from
johnson
against
zerbst
to
carnley
required.
accordingly,
this
court
should
remand
to
the
district
court
with
directions
to
vacate
the
guilty
plea
without
further
evidentiary
hearing
or
in
the
alternative
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
thank
you.
