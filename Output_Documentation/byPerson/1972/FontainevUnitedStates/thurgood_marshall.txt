justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
of
what
the
us
attorney
told
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
obviously,
they
had
been
together
and
they
had
been
discussing
it
because
they
already
had
two
waivers
signed,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
declares
probably
one-sided
plea
bargaining?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
not
been
a
record
on
it,
just
assumptions
that
a
plea
can
make?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
the
us
attorney
discussed
this
case
outside
of
the
court
with
the
petitioner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
was
he
with
the
us
attorney?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
gather
from
that
that
if
that
period
of
time
and
nobody
knows
how
long
it
was,
this
man
was
in
the
presence
of
the
us
attorney
and
nobody
else
and
the
only
legal
advice
he
was
getting
was
from
the
us
attorney,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
how
long
it
was
before,
you
don’t!
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
either.
but
during
whatever
period
of
time
it
was,
this
man’s
only
legal
advice
was
coming
from
the
us
attorney.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
just
did
not
waive
these
two
things
he
signed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
know
he
didn’t.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
didn’t
have
the
blanks,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
his
[voice

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don’t,
you
don’t
think
as
to
the
kind
of
the
legal
(voice
overlap).
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
taken
into
consideration
at
all,
the
point
i’ve
been
trying
to
--
we
don’t
know
anything
that
happened
to
that
man
from
the
time
he
was
picked
up
by
the
state
until
he
walked
in
with
the
us
attorney.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
part
of
the
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
does
he
know
what
a
threat
or
a
promise
is?
does
he
know
what
coercion
is?
i
mean,
this
man
is,
so
far
as
i
know,
is
in
the
courtroom
and
there’s
nobody
there
but
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
and
him
and
not
one
of
them
does
he
consider
to
be
his
friend
or
relative?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
shouldn’t
somebody
be
there
to
hold
his
hand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
court,
i
understand
has
said
that
plea
bargaining
is
alright.
i
mean,
this
man
didn’t
have
anything.
he
had
one
sided
plea
bargaining.
the
us
attorney
plea
bargained
with
him
and
there’s
no
question
that
he
talked
to
the
us
attorney.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
no
question
the
us
attorney
talked
to
him
and
i
don’t
know
what
the
us
attorney
told
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
sign
a
waiver
of
counsel
with
the
us
attorney?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
waived
it
before
he
got
to
the
judge,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
is
a
waiver
outside
of
the
court
a
good
waiver?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understood
the
us
attorney
walked
in
with
him
and
said
i
have
these
in
my
hand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
waived
all
his
rights
in
his
one-sided
advice
from
the
us
attorney,
then
he
is
bound
by
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
the
court
say
you
could
disregard
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
understood.
justice
thurgood

is
there
anything
in

of
