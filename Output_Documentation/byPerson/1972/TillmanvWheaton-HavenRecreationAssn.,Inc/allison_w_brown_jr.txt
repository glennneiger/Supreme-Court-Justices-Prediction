ms.

w.
brown,

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
a
case
which
this
court
had
four
or
three
years
ago
called
sullivan
against
little
hunting
park.
the
issue
here
as
it
was
there
is
whether
a
community
recreation
association
may
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
which
respect
the
persons
who
are
otherwise
eligible
to
use
its
facilities.
wheaton-haven
recreation
association,
the
organization
at
issue
here
is
virtually
a
carbon
copy
of
little
hunting
park,
the
association
which
was
at
issue
in
the
sullivan
case.
the
principle
characteristic
of
wheaton-haven
recreation
association
is
set
by
its
bylaws
which
state
very
unequivocally
that
membership
shall
be
open
to
bona
fide
residents,
whether
or
not
home
owners
of
the
area
within
a
three
quarter
mile
radius
of
the
pool.
the
facility
involved,
which
is
the
principle
function
of
wheaton-haven
is
the
swimming
pool
that
it
operates.
the
swimming
pool
is
similar
to
those
that
are
characteristic
of
many
suburban
areas
in
the
united
states
and
most
particularly
in
the
washington
area.
in
washington
suburbs
are
some
100-150
of
them
that
have
been
built
by
neighbors,
people
in
the
neighborhood
on
a
cooperative
basis.
they
are
principally
predominant
in
the
areas
where
of
course
there
are
no
public
swimming
facilities.
wheaton-haven
has
an
initiation
fee
of
$375
and
in
addition,
annual
dues
of
$50-60
a
year.
i
regret
to
say
that
on
page
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
there
is
a
typographical
error,
where
it
says
that
the
annual
dues
are
a
$150-160
a
year,
it
should
be
$50-60
a
year.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
page
4
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
the
annual
dues
are
$50-60,
not
a
$150-160,
that’s
the
blue
brief.
the
bylaws
provide
that
numbers
can
be
taken
from
outside
of
the
three
quarter
mile
radius
of
the
pool
provided
that
such
numbers
do
not
exceed
30%
of
the
membership
of
the
association.
members
who
are
brought
into
the
association,
who
pay
their
dues
are
subject
to
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
or
the
membership
of
the
association.
one
of
the
characteristics
or
one
of
the
features
of
membership
in
the
pool
is
that
a
member
upon
selling
his
house,
may
transfer
a
first
option
to
his
vendee.
now,
he
does
this
by
selling
his
membership
back
to
the
association
and
that
vendee
then
has
a
first
option
to
buy
that.
that
is
--
and
that
gives
him
a
preference
over
any
persons
who
are
on
a
waiting
list.
the
maximum
number
of
members
permitted
in
the
pool
being
325
families.
wheaton-haven
was
constructed
in
1958
under
the
terms
of
a
special
ordinance
adopted
by
the
montgomery
county,
maryland
council
which
is
adopted
and
designed
to
facilitate
the
construction
of
these
community
recreation
--
swimming
pools.
the
montgomery
county
council
stated
that
it
wished
to
promote
the
building
and
construction
of
these
pools
because
they
served
an
important
community
function
by
providing
recreation
facilities
which
were
not
otherwise
available
in
the
area.
as
a
condition
of
getting
zoning
approval,
the
wheaton-haven
was
required
by
the
zoning
authority
to
show
--
demonstrate
that
60%
of
its
construction
cost
were
subscribed.
in
other
words,
that
was
in
fact
meeting
a
need
of
the
community.
as
a
means
of
creating
its
initial
membership,
the
association
conducted
a
door
to
door
solicitation
campaign
in
the
area.
it
distributed
an
advertising
circular
and
charter
members
--
memberships
were
made
available
on
the
payment
of
a
$20
pledge.
it's
original
organizational
meeting
was
a
public
meeting
held,
or
i
should
say
its
original
promotional
meeting
was
a
public
meeting
held
in
the
auditorium
of
the
maryland
national
capital
park
and
planning
commission,
a
government
agency
which
has
a
public
auditorium.
wheaton-haven
has
always
had
a
sign
posted
on
its
premises
which
is
visible
from
the
street
in
front
which
states
the
name
and
telephone
number
of
the
membership
chairman.
in
more
recent
years,
since
this
litigation
has
transpired
that
sign
has
--
the
name
of
the
membership
chairman
and
his
telephone
number
has
been
removed.
at
the
hearing
before
the
zoning
authority
in
1958,
when
wheaton-haven
sought
commission
to
build
its
facility,
its
swimming
pool,
its
representatives
testified
that
the
pool
would
serve
the
needs
of
the
community
as
a
whole
and
that
it
was
needed
as
a
deterrent
to
juvenile
delinquency
in
the
neighborhood.
it
was
specified
that
the
pool
would
not
be
used
for
private
social
functions.
the
construction
of
the
pool
was
performed
by
a
contractor
from
outside
the
state
of
maryland
and
the
pool
utilizes
pumps
and
filters
and
other
mechanical
devices
which
originate
from
outside
the
state.
now,
in
the
spring
of
1968,
to
get
down
to
the
facts
of
the
discrimination
here,
dr.
and
mrs.
harry
presses
sought
membership
in
the
pool.
they
are
a
black
family
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
within
a
three
quarter
mile
radius
of
the
pool.
the
membership,
they
were
told
was
unavailable
to
them
because
of
their
race
or
color.
similarly
in
1968,
in
july
of
that
year,
mr.
and
mrs.
murray
tillman,
white
members
of
the
association
brought
a
black
guest,
mrs.
grace
rosner
to
the
pool
and
although
she
was
admitted
on
a
first
occasion,
she
was
later
denied
admission
under
the
guides
of
the
new
rule
which
pool
adopted
after
her
first
entry
stating
that
henceforth
only
relatives
of
members
would
be
admitted.
it
is
undisputed
on
the
record
that
the
pool
has
and
enforces
a
discriminatory
policy
with
respect
to
memberships
and
guests.
the
suit
in
here,
in
this
case
was
initiated
in
federal
district
court
in
baltimore
on
the
basis
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
district
court
held
against
the
plaintiffs
and
upon
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
held
against
the
plaintiffs.
the
basis
for
their
decisions
in
both
instances
was
that
this
case
was
distinguishable
from
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park.
it
is
the
petitioner’s
position
that
both
courts
violated
the
principle
of
stare
decisis.
this
case
is
on
all
four
with
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park.
there
are
seldom
two
cases
with
facts
more
similar.
the
court
of
appeals
or
both
courts
constructed
grounds
for
distinguishing
the
two
cases.
i
will
deal
principally
of
course
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
committed
two
basic
errors.
first
of
all
it
misconstrued
the
civil
rights
act
in
1866,
which
had
been
the
basis
for
this
court’s
holding
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park.
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
insubstantial
and
indeed
in
some
instances
wholly
false
grounds
for
distinguishing
this
case,
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park
and
concluded
that
wheaton-haven
recreation
association
was
a
private
club
and
hence
exempt
from
both
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
of
1964.
i
will
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
wheaton-haven
is
a
private
club
in
a
moment,
since
that
bears
on
whether
or
not
it
is
indeed
covered
by
the
1866
law
and
the
1964
act.
but
i
would
like
to
first
point
out
the
matter
in
which
we
believe
the
court
engaged
--
basically
misconstrued
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
that
act
the
court
will
recall
was
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
first
in
jones
versus
mayer
company.
in
jones
versus
mayer
company
the
court
held
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
the
civil
rights
of
1866
applied
to
private
discrimination
and
that
they
were
intended,
that
the
act
of
1866
was
intended
to
abolish
all
badges
and
incidents
of
slavery,
and
that
the
act
was
to
be
broadly
construed.
the
1866
act
has
since
been
incorporated
in
--
that
is
since
its
adoption
has
been
incorporated
and
is
now
part
of
42
u.s.c
1981
and
42
u.s.c
1982.
1981
guarantees
black
person’s
the
same
right
as
white
persons,
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
and
1982
provides
that
black
person
shall
have
the
right
as
white
persons
“to
inherit,
purchase,
lease,
sale,
hold
and
convey
real
and
personal
property.”
in
jones
against
mayer
and
indeed
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
there
were
some
members
of
this
court
who
dissented
and
who
in
fact
doubted
the
wisdom
of
applying
the
1866
law
to
private
discrimination
in
housing
and
in
sullivan
case
to
a
membership
in
a
swimming
pool
association
because
they
felt
that
more
emphasis
should
be
given
to
the
court
or
more
significance
should
be
given
by
the
court,
should
be
placed
by
the
court
upon
--
the
more
recent
enactments
by
congress
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
fair
housing
act
or
the
fair
housing
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968.
in
other
words,
the
dissenting
members
in
those
cases
felt
that
those
case
--
those
laws
and
more
recent
laws
should
be
given
--
should
be
made
applicable
and
they
questioned
the
wisdom
of
resurrecting
the
old
1866
law.
however,
since
that
time,
since
the
jones
decision
and
since
the
sullivan
decision,
numerous
court
decisions
have
now
applied
both
42
u.s.c
1981
and
1982
to
a
variety
of
kinds
of
racial
discrimination.
provisions
have
been
applied
in
cases
of
employment
discrimination,
in
cases
of
housing
discrimination,
in
cases
of
discrimination
with
respect
to
public
accommodations,
schools,
cemetery
plots
and
so
forth.
and
most
recently
a
significant
development
occurred
which
unfortunately
we
failed
to
be
aware
of
in
time
to
cover
in
our
brief
and
that
is
that
congress
has
now
in
effect
ratified
this
court's
decision
in
jones
against
mayer.
on
february
8
and
9
of
this
year,
during
the
debates
on
the
equal
employment
opportunity
law
and
the
question
of
whether
enforcement
power
should
be
given
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
an
amendment
was
introduced
by
senator
hruska
which
would
have
withdrawn
any
right
of
an
individual
to
seek
relief
in
the
federal
courts
on
the
basis
of
42
u.s.c
1981.
it
would
have
limited
one's
right
of
redress
to
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
namely
the
fair
employment
provisions
of
that
act.
the
hruska
amendment
was
debated,
it
was
criticized
by
the
floor
leaders
for
the
bill,
the
legislation
was
under
consideration.
senator
williams
of
new
jersey
and
senator
javits
of
new
york,
those
senators
hailed
this
court's
decision
in
jones
against
mayer
and
specifically
expressed
approval
of
the
construction
that
the
judicial
laws
which
has
accrued,
which
in
fact
holds
that
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
and
the
act
of
1866
provide
alternative
means
to
redress
individual
grievances.
the
result
was
that
the
hruska
amendment
was
defeated.
so
therefore
it
seems
apparent
that
there
was
no
longer
any
basis
for
holding
back,
shall
we
say,
on
the
meaning
or
the
construction
to
be
given
to
the
1866
law.
it
applies
here
to
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
indeed
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
me
engaged
in
a
very
serious
error
by
failing
to
follow
this
court's
admonition
that
the
plain
words
of
the
1866
law,
should
be
broadly
construed
and
complied
with.
now
the
plaintiffs
base
their
sue
as
they
indicated
on
both
the
1866
law
and
the
1964
law.
essentially
under
the
1866
law,
they
have
claimed
that
there
were
contract
and
property
interest
of
their's
which
had
been
impaired
by
the
discrimination
committed
by
the
association.
the
plaintiffs
depresses
who
had
sort
to
purchase
a
swimming
pool
membership
claimed,
asserted
in
the
complaint
that
their
contract
and
property
interest
had
been
denied
and
denied
them
which
were
otherwise
--
interest
which
would
have
been
available
to
them,
had
they
been
of
the
caucasian
race.
the
tillman
plaintiffs,
the
white
plaintiffs
had
contract
and
property
interest
involved
in
the
swimming
pool
membership.
their
allegations
and
their
position
in
this
case
was
similar
to
that
of
the
plaintiff
sullivan
in
the
case
of
sullivan
against
little
hunting
park.
there
not
only
were
their
own
interest
being
impinged
or
impaired
by,
on
the
basis
of
racial
considerations
but
in
addition
they
were
in
a
position
of
asserting
the
rights
of
the
negro
guest
that
they
had
brought
to
the
pool,
mrs.
rosner.
mrs.
rosner’s
interest
grows
from
the
fact
that
as
a
guest
of
tillman's
she
had
a
licensed
or
an
easement
that
was
enforceable
and
recognizable
as
a
property
for
contract
interest.
now
the
other
ground
aside
from
its
misconstruction
of
the
1866
law
which
we
claim
the
court
of
appeals
seriously
departed
from
this
court's
precedent
on
was
the
issue
of
the
private
club.
the
court
held
that
because
in
it's
view
wheaton
haven
was
a
private
club,
it
fell
within
the
private
club
exemption
of
the
1964
act.
this
exemption,
exempts
from
the
public
accommodation
provisions
of
that
act,
any
private
club
or
other
establishment
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public.
now
the
court
of
appeals
committed
additional
error
in
our
view
by
--
it's
quite
clear
by
reading
that
exemption
as
a
limitation
on
the
1866
act.
now
this
court
both
in
the
case
of
jones
against
mayer
and
in
the
case
of
sullivan
against
little
hunting
park,
has
specifically
held
that
the
later
enactments
of
congress
were
not
--
did
not
in
anyway
limit
or
qualify
the
earlier
enactments
and
indeed
that
is
the
effect
now
of
many
other
court
opinions,
decisions
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
as
i
just
indicated
it's
--
certainly
the
effect
also
of
the
congress’s
rejection
of
an
amendment
which
would
have
constituted
a
limitation
on
the
1866
act.
now
the
question
then
arises,
what
kind
of
a
limitation
if
any
is
there
on
the
1866
act
so
far
as
the
matter
of
a
private
club
is
concerned.
we
would
submit
that
the
only
limitation
is
a
constitutional
limitation.
there
is
we
would
agree
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
or
freedom
of
the
association.
this
court
has
never
defined
that
in
very
explicit
terms
in
circumstances
comparable
to
these.
the
right
of
privacy
received
it's
fullest
discussion,
i
suppose
in
as
far
as
i
know
in
the
case
of
griswold
against
connecticut
which
involved
of
course
the
matter
of
birth
control
devices
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
which
was
part
of
the
penumbra
of
the
bill
of
rights,
that
has
not
been
expanded
upon
to
any
great
degree
as
far
as
i
know
in
subsequent
decisions
of
the
court.
there
have
been
holdings
that
there
is
a
constitutional
rights
of
free
association
which
is
based
on
the
first
amendment
and
that
as
a
result
associations
may
not
be
interfered,
unduly
interfered
with
as
a
result
of
state
action
or
infringement
of
their
constitutional
right
of
association,
of
their
free
association.
however,
that
issue
is
not
really
--
those
issues
are
not
really
involved
here
to
the
extent
that
they
need
to
be
the
outer
limits
or
the
privacy
need
to
be
explored
or
delineated
by
this
court.
the
real
question
here
was
resolved
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
where
the
court
held
very
clearly
that
little
hunting
park
was
not
a
private
club
because
it
had
no
program
--
no
plan
or
program
of
exclusiveness;
no
plan
or
purpose
of
exclusiveness
and
that
it
had
no
criteria
for
excluding
people
from
its
facilities,
other
than
race.
now,
we
submit
that
exactly
the
same
thing
is
true
of
wheaton-haven.
as
indicated
by
the
bylaws
and
as
indicated
by
the
record
here,
there
has
never
been
a
basis,
any
ground,
there
have
never
been
any
grounds
for
excluding
people
that
have
been
--
that
are
in
any
way
reflected
in
the
record.
there
is
indication
that
one
person
in
this
association's
10-year
history
was
excluded,
the
record
doesn't
indicate
why.
it
doesn't
indicate
the
person's
race,
it
doesn't
indicate
where
the
person
lived,
whether
he
might
have
been
outside
the
geographic
area
and
indeed,
it
doesn't
indicate
whether
he
might
have
been
afflicted
with
some
dreaded
disease,
which
would
make
his
presence
in
the
swimming
pool
undesirable.
so,
there
is
no
record
of
excluding
people.
there
are
no
criteria
anywhere
that
could
indicate
that
the
association
had
intended
to
exclude
people
so
long
as
they
lived
within
the
prescribed
geographic
area.
with
respect
to
the
1964
act,
there
has
been
some
questions
as
to
just
what
meaning
should
be
given
to
this
private
club
exemption
in
the
1964
act?
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
as
a
practical
matter,
although
the
--
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
the
exemption
in
the
1964
--
from
the
1964
act
should
be
read
to
be
coextensive
with
the
constitutional
limitation,
which
as
i
say,
i
would
concede
applies
to
the
1866
act.
i
say
that
on
a
basis
of
the
statutory
history,
the
congressional
history,
which
we
have
eluded
to
in
our
reply
brief,
where
senator
humphrey,
who
is
the
floor
manager
for
the
1964
civil
rights
act
in
explaining
the
exemption
for
private
clubs
stated
that
it
was
intended
to
protect
only
the
genuine
privacy
of
private
clubs,
whose
membership
is
genuinely
selected.
well
that
language
certainly,
parallels
very
closely
the
language
of
this
court
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park
and
it
seemed
that
there
would
be
no
basis
for
creating
different
criteria
or
a
different
right
of
privacy.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
error
of
reading
the
statutory
provision
as
a
limitation
on
the
1866
law.
there
have
been
references
made
in
the
briefs
and
of
course,
the
question
naturally
arises
in
anyone's
mind
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
famous
moose
lodge
case,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
quite
recently.
and
of
course,
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
moose
lodge,
between
wheaton-haven
and
the
moose
lodge
is
like
the
difference
between
day
and
night.
the
constitution
of
the
moose
lodge
organization
specifically
states
that
membership
is
restricted
to
male
persons
of
the
caucasian
or
white
race
above
the
age
of
21
years
and
not
married
to
someone
of
any
other
than
the
caucasian
or
white
race,
who
are
of
good
moral
character,
physically
and
mentally
normal,
who
shall
profess
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being.
moose
by
its
own
definition,
is
exclusionary,
it's
a
traditional
fraternal
organization.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
of
course,
of
course.
obviously,
that
case
involves
state
action
and
i
only
cited
it
because
it
has
been
relied
on
by
the
respondents
here,
that
is
to
suggest
that
because
the
court
indict
him
or
i
guess,
really
assumed
in
that
they
didn't
indict
in
the
court,
the
basic
assumption
in
that
case
was
that
moose
lodge
a
private
organization
and
i
am
simply
saying
that,
that
so
be
it
but
that
this
wheaton-haven
is
wholly
distinguishable
as
an
organization,
simply
because
wheaton-haven
has
no
exclusionary
criteria
of
the
sort
that
exists
in
moose
lodge.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
the
only
one.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
none
other,
no
sir,
and
it's
open
specifically
by
its
own
bylaws
to
everyone
else
within
that
parameter.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
no,
not
specifically
sir.
the
option
is
merely
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
property
interests
that
is
involved
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
essentially.
although
the
option,
well,
i
don't
mean
to
say
it
would
be
the
same,
but
the
option
is
one
of
the
indicia
of
the
fact
that
the
pool
membership
here
is
an
incident
of
real
property
in
that
neighborhood.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
yes.
but
that
membership
approval,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
has
ever
been
utilized
other
than
in
the
one
instance
that
we
referred
to.
but
certainly
by
making
that
option,
putting
that
option
in
there,
it
adds
to
the
inducement
of
persons
to
buy
a
membership
and
it
increases
the
attraction
and
value
of
homes
in
the
neighborhood.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
think
that
they
could
utilize,
yes,
the
kinds
of
reasons
that
you
are
discussing,
chronic
alcoholic,
a
person
with
a
dreaded
skin
disease
or
a
person
who
lives
outside
the
geographic
area.
but
those
are
criteria
which
are
comparable
to
those
which
the
proprietor
--
i
say
comparable
to
those,
that
the
proprietor
of
any
business
might
use,
he
can
exclude
persons
and
not
that
this
is
a
business,
but
it's
an
accommodation.
the
proprietor
of
any
public
accommodation
can
exclude
persons
who
are
going
to
be
disruptive,
who
perhaps
don't
wear
a
necktie,
if
you
go
to
a
restaurant.
there
are
reasons
why
a
place
can
draw
lines
as
to
a
kind
of
the
patrons
it
wants,
but
that
doesn't
indicate
that
it
has
an
absolute
right
of
privacy
which
is
exempts
it
from
the
operation
of
the
civil
right
acts.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
he
can
become
a
member
if
the
membership
rolls
are
open,
that
is
not
--
haven’t
exceeded
the
limit
and
so
long
as
the
number
of
persons
from
outside
the
three
quarter
mile
limit
do
not
exceed
the
30%
of
its
total
membership.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well
usually
they
were
not.
although
at
the
time
of
the
events
here
in
they
were
full,
they
were
at
the
325
of
limit.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
just
like
to
say
very
briefly
that
the
important
thing
here
to
consider
and
which
has
been
stressed
in
the
plaintiff’s
briefs
and
has
been
stressed
in
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
justice
department
in
this
case
is
that
these
community
recreational
facilities
of
the
type
that
is
involved
here
are
not
country
clubs
or
fraternal
organizations
or
sororities.
they
are
organizations
established
as
the
records
shows
here
to
serve
the
community
and
i
submit
that
if
in
this
day
of
--
where
there
is
a
governmental
policy
attempting
to
foster
a
free
and
open
housing
for
example,
there
can
be
no
more
significant
and
detrimental
poignant
badge
of
slavery
than
to
have
a
situation
where
everyone
in
the
neighborhood
is
eligible
to
use
local
community
swimming
pool
except
the
black
family
that
happens
to
move
in
that
neighborhood
and
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
here.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
at
the
time,
in
the
early
days,
at
the
time
wheaton-haven
was
first
organized,
the
record
shows
that
there
were
no
public
pools
and
indeed
the
organizers
had
asked
the
county
authorities
about
that
to
build
the
public
pool
in
that
area
and
they
were
told
we
cannot
afford
to,
we
are
too
busy
building
schools
and
consequently
they
went
ahead
and
built
this
pool
in
the
local
community,
that
is
on
the
record.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
oh
yes,
there
is
a
--
well,
there
is
a
single
block,
one
level
frame
building
which
is
where
they
keep
their
facilities
i
guess
or
keep
their
tools
and
the
equipment
and
pumping
equipment,
and
filters
and
so
on
and
they
have
some
vending
machines
there.
i
do
not
know
what
else
is
there,
that
is
not
reflected
in
the
record,
sir.
but
there
is
no
club
house
to
the
social
activity
on
the
premises.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
the
record
shows
that
there
was
service
of
foods
from
these
vending
machines
for
people
who
were
admitted
of
course
to
the
premises
and
this
is
the
whole
basis
or
one
basis
for
our
assertion
that
they
are
covered
by
the
1964
public
accommodations
act
which
if
you
would
“hinges”
on
the
service
of
food
or
the
existence
of
other
kinds
of
equipment
which
are
passed
on
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
is
why
we
asserted
jurisdiction
under
the
1964
act.
i
would
just
like
to
say
in
closing
that
the
association
here,
as
the
record
will
show
made
a
commitment
to
the
people
who
were
originally
solicited
to
join,
it
made
a
commitment
to
the
public
authorities
in
montgomery
county
that
it
would
provide
a
public
community
service
facility
and
we
submit
that
now
those
same
--
the
people
who
are
in
charge
of
this
facility
are
attempting
to
convert
it
from
a
community
facility
into
a
haven
for
whites.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that
is
sir,
in
a
decision
of
the
montgomery
county
commission
on
human
relations
–
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
right,
which
is
in
the
record
was
submitted
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
received
it
and
considered
it.
so,
there
are
certain
findings
which
were
made
by
that
human
relations
commission
which
are
included
in
the
record,
were
in
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
number
of
those
finding
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
were
in
fact
stipulated
--
not
stipulated
to,
but
they
were
brought
out
in
the
course
of
discovery
in
interrogatories
and
admissions.
so,
there
really
is
no
--
they
are
in
the
record
in
that
way,
if
not
through
the
human
relations
commission’s
decision.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
a
case
which
this
court
had
four
or
three
years
ago
called
sullivan
against
little
hunting
park.
the
issue
here
as
it
was
there
is
whether
a
community
recreation
association
may
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
which
respect
the
persons
who
are
otherwise
eligible
to
use
its
facilities.
wheaton-haven
recreation
association,
the
organization
at
issue
here
is
virtually
a
carbon
copy
of
little
hunting
park,
the
association
which
was
at
issue
in
the
sullivan
case.
the
principle
characteristic
of
wheaton-haven
recreation
association
is
set
by
its
bylaws
which
state
very
unequivocally
that
membership
shall
be
open
to
bona
fide
residents,
whether
or
not
home
owners
of
the
area
within
a
three
quarter
mile
radius
of
the
pool.
the
facility
involved,
which
is
the
principle
function
of
wheaton-haven
is
the
swimming
pool
that
it
operates.
the
swimming
pool
is
similar
to
those
that
are
characteristic
of
many
suburban
areas
in
the
united
states
and
most
particularly
in
the
washington
area.
in
washington
suburbs
are
some
100-150
of
them
that
have
been
built
by
neighbors,
people
in
the
neighborhood
on
a
cooperative
basis.
they
are
principally
predominant
in
the
areas
where
of
course
there
are
no
public
swimming
facilities.
wheaton-haven
has
an
initiation
fee
of
$375
and
in
addition,
annual
dues
of
$50-60
a
year.
i
regret
to
say
that
on
page
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
there
is
a
typographical
error,
where
it
says
that
the
annual
dues
are
a
$150-160
a
year,
it
should
be
$50-60
a
year.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
page
4
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
the
annual
dues
are
$50-60,
not
a
$150-160,
that’s
the
blue
brief.
the
bylaws
provide
that
numbers
can
be
taken
from
outside
of
the
three
quarter
mile
radius
of
the
pool
provided
that
such
numbers
do
not
exceed
30%
of
the
membership
of
the
association.
members
who
are
brought
into
the
association,
who
pay
their
dues
are
subject
to
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
or
the
membership
of
the
association.
one
of
the
characteristics
or
one
of
the
features
of
membership
in
the
pool
is
that
a
member
upon
selling
his
house,
may
transfer
a
first
option
to
his
vendee.
now,
he
does
this
by
selling
his
membership
back
to
the
association
and
that
vendee
then
has
a
first
option
to
buy
that.
that
is
--
and
that
gives
him
a
preference
over
any
persons
who
are
on
a
waiting
list.
the
maximum
number
of
members
permitted
in
the
pool
being
325
families.
wheaton-haven
was
constructed
in
1958
under
the
terms
of
a
special
ordinance
adopted
by
the
montgomery
county,
maryland
council
which
is
adopted
and
designed
to
facilitate
the
construction
of
these
community
recreation
--
swimming
pools.
the
montgomery
county
council
stated
that
it
wished
to
promote
the
building
and
construction
of
these
pools
because
they
served
an
important
community
function
by
providing
recreation
facilities
which
were
not
otherwise
available
in
the
area.
as
a
condition
of
getting
zoning
approval,
the
wheaton-haven
was
required
by
the
zoning
authority
to
show
--
demonstrate
that
60%
of
its
construction
cost
were
subscribed.
in
other
words,
that
was
in
fact
meeting
a
need
of
the
community.
as
a
means
of
creating
its
initial
membership,
the
association
conducted
a
door
to
door
solicitation
campaign
in
the
area.
it
distributed
an
advertising
circular
and
charter
members
--
memberships
were
made
available
on
the
payment
of
a
$20
pledge.
it's
original
organizational
meeting
was
a
public
meeting
held,
or
i
should
say
its
original
promotional
meeting
was
a
public
meeting
held
in
the
auditorium
of
the
maryland
national
capital
park
and
planning
commission,
a
government
agency
which
has
a
public
auditorium.
wheaton-haven
has
always
had
a
sign
posted
on
its
premises
which
is
visible
from
the
street
in
front
which
states
the
name
and
telephone
number
of
the
membership
chairman.
in
more
recent
years,
since
this
litigation
has
transpired
that
sign
has
--
the
name
of
the
membership
chairman
and
his
telephone
number
has
been
removed.
at
the
hearing
before
the
zoning
authority
in
1958,
when
wheaton-haven
sought
commission
to
build
its
facility,
its
swimming
pool,
its
representatives
testified
that
the
pool
would
serve
the
needs
of
the
community
as
a
whole
and
that
it
was
needed
as
a
deterrent
to
juvenile
delinquency
in
the
neighborhood.
it
was
specified
that
the
pool
would
not
be
used
for
private
social
functions.
the
construction
of
the
pool
was
performed
by
a
contractor
from
outside
the
state
of
maryland
and
the
pool
utilizes
pumps
and
filters
and
other
mechanical
devices
which
originate
from
outside
the
state.
now,
in
the
spring
of
1968,
to
get
down
to
the
facts
of
the
discrimination
here,
dr.
and
mrs.
harry
presses
sought
membership
in
the
pool.
they
are
a
black
family
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
within
a
three
quarter
mile
radius
of
the
pool.
the
membership,
they
were
told
was
unavailable
to
them
because
of
their
race
or
color.
similarly
in
1968,
in
july
of
that
year,
mr.
and
mrs.
murray
tillman,
white
members
of
the
association
brought
a
black
guest,
mrs.
grace
rosner
to
the
pool
and
although
she
was
admitted
on
a
first
occasion,
she
was
later
denied
admission
under
the
guides
of
the
new
rule
which
pool
adopted
after
her
first
entry
stating
that
henceforth
only
relatives
of
members
would
be
admitted.
it
is
undisputed
on
the
record
that
the
pool
has
and
enforces
a
discriminatory
policy
with
respect
to
memberships
and
guests.
the
suit
in
here,
in
this
case
was
initiated
in
federal
district
court
in
baltimore
on
the
basis
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
district
court
held
against
the
plaintiffs
and
upon
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
held
against
the
plaintiffs.
the
basis
for
their
decisions
in
both
instances
was
that
this
case
was
distinguishable
from
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park.
it
is
the
petitioner’s
position
that
both
courts
violated
the
principle
of
stare
decisis.
this
case
is
on
all
four
with
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park.
there
are
seldom
two
cases
with
facts
more
similar.
the
court
of
appeals
or
both
courts
constructed
grounds
for
distinguishing
the
two
cases.
i
will
deal
principally
of
course
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
committed
two
basic
errors.
first
of
all
it
misconstrued
the
civil
rights
act
in
1866,
which
had
been
the
basis
for
this
court’s
holding
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park.
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
insubstantial
and
indeed
in
some
instances
wholly
false
grounds
for
distinguishing
this
case,
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park
and
concluded
that
wheaton-haven
recreation
association
was
a
private
club
and
hence
exempt
from
both
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
of
1964.
i
will
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
wheaton-haven
is
a
private
club
in
a
moment,
since
that
bears
on
whether
or
not
it
is
indeed
covered
by
the
1866
law
and
the
1964
act.
but
i
would
like
to
first
point
out
the
matter
in
which
we
believe
the
court
engaged
--
basically
misconstrued
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
that
act
the
court
will
recall
was
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
first
in
jones
versus
mayer
company.
in
jones
versus
mayer
company
the
court
held
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
the
civil
rights
of
1866
applied
to
private
discrimination
and
that
they
were
intended,
that
the
act
of
1866
was
intended
to
abolish
all
badges
and
incidents
of
slavery,
and
that
the
act
was
to
be
broadly
construed.
the
1866
act
has
since
been
incorporated
in
--
that
is
since
its
adoption
has
been
incorporated
and
is
now
part
of
42
u.s.c
1981
and
42
u.s.c
1982.
1981
guarantees
black
person’s
the
same
right
as
white
persons,
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
and
1982
provides
that
black
person
shall
have
the
right
as
white
persons
“to
inherit,
purchase,
lease,
sale,
hold
and
convey
real
and
personal
property.”
in
jones
against
mayer
and
indeed
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
there
were
some
members
of
this
court
who
dissented
and
who
in
fact
doubted
the
wisdom
of
applying
the
1866
law
to
private
discrimination
in
housing
and
in
sullivan
case
to
a
membership
in
a
swimming
pool
association
because
they
felt
that
more
emphasis
should
be
given
to
the
court
or
more
significance
should
be
given
by
the
court,
should
be
placed
by
the
court
upon
--
the
more
recent
enactments
by
congress
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
fair
housing
act
or
the
fair
housing
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968.
in
other
words,
the
dissenting
members
in
those
cases
felt
that
those
case
--
those
laws
and
more
recent
laws
should
be
given
--
should
be
made
applicable
and
they
questioned
the
wisdom
of
resurrecting
the
old
1866
law.
however,
since
that
time,
since
the
jones
decision
and
since
the
sullivan
decision,
numerous
court
decisions
have
now
applied
both
42
u.s.c
1981
and
1982
to
a
variety
of
kinds
of
racial
discrimination.
provisions
have
been
applied
in
cases
of
employment
discrimination,
in
cases
of
housing
discrimination,
in
cases
of
discrimination
with
respect
to
public
accommodations,
schools,
cemetery
plots
and
so
forth.
and
most
recently
a
significant
development
occurred
which
unfortunately
we
failed
to
be
aware
of
in
time
to
cover
in
our
brief
and
that
is
that
congress
has
now
in
effect
ratified
this
court's
decision
in
jones
against
mayer.
on
february
8
and
9
of
this
year,
during
the
debates
on
the
equal
employment
opportunity
law
and
the
question
of
whether
enforcement
power
should
be
given
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
an
amendment
was
introduced
by
senator
hruska
which
would
have
withdrawn
any
right
of
an
individual
to
seek
relief
in
the
federal
courts
on
the
basis
of
42
u.s.c
1981.
it
would
have
limited
one's
right
of
redress
to
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
namely
the
fair
employment
provisions
of
that
act.
the
hruska
amendment
was
debated,
it
was
criticized
by
the
floor
leaders
for
the
bill,
the
legislation
was
under
consideration.
senator
williams
of
new
jersey
and
senator
javits
of
new
york,
those
senators
hailed
this
court's
decision
in
jones
against
mayer
and
specifically
expressed
approval
of
the
construction
that
the
judicial
laws
which
has
accrued,
which
in
fact
holds
that
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
and
the
act
of
1866
provide
alternative
means
to
redress
individual
grievances.
the
result
was
that
the
hruska
amendment
was
defeated.
so
therefore
it
seems
apparent
that
there
was
no
longer
any
basis
for
holding
back,
shall
we
say,
on
the
meaning
or
the
construction
to
be
given
to
the
1866
law.
it
applies
here
to
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
indeed
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
me
engaged
in
a
very
serious
error
by
failing
to
follow
this
court's
admonition
that
the
plain
words
of
the
1866
law,
should
be
broadly
construed
and
complied
with.
now
the
plaintiffs
base
their
sue
as
they
indicated
on
both
the
1866
law
and
the
1964
law.
essentially
under
the
1866
law,
they
have
claimed
that
there
were
contract
and
property
interest
of
their's
which
had
been
impaired
by
the
discrimination
committed
by
the
association.
the
plaintiffs
depresses
who
had
sort
to
purchase
a
swimming
pool
membership
claimed,
asserted
in
the
complaint
that
their
contract
and
property
interest
had
been
denied
and
denied
them
which
were
otherwise
--
interest
which
would
have
been
available
to
them,
had
they
been
of
the
caucasian
race.
the
tillman
plaintiffs,
the
white
plaintiffs
had
contract
and
property
interest
involved
in
the
swimming
pool
membership.
their
allegations
and
their
position
in
this
case
was
similar
to
that
of
the
plaintiff
sullivan
in
the
case
of
sullivan
against
little
hunting
park.
there
not
only
were
their
own
interest
being
impinged
or
impaired
by,
on
the
basis
of
racial
considerations
but
in
addition
they
were
in
a
position
of
asserting
the
rights
of
the
negro
guest
that
they
had
brought
to
the
pool,
mrs.
rosner.
mrs.
rosner’s
interest
grows
from
the
fact
that
as
a
guest
of
tillman's
she
had
a
licensed
or
an
easement
that
was
enforceable
and
recognizable
as
a
property
for
contract
interest.
now
the
other
ground
aside
from
its
misconstruction
of
the
1866
law
which
we
claim
the
court
of
appeals
seriously
departed
from
this
court's
precedent
on
was
the
issue
of
the
private
club.
the
court
held
that
because
in
it's
view
wheaton
haven
was
a
private
club,
it
fell
within
the
private
club
exemption
of
the
1964
act.
this
exemption,
exempts
from
the
public
accommodation
provisions
of
that
act,
any
private
club
or
other
establishment
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public.
now
the
court
of
appeals
committed
additional
error
in
our
view
by
--
it's
quite
clear
by
reading
that
exemption
as
a
limitation
on
the
1866
act.
now
this
court
both
in
the
case
of
jones
against
mayer
and
in
the
case
of
sullivan
against
little
hunting
park,
has
specifically
held
that
the
later
enactments
of
congress
were
not
--
did
not
in
anyway
limit
or
qualify
the
earlier
enactments
and
indeed
that
is
the
effect
now
of
many
other
court
opinions,
decisions
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
as
i
just
indicated
it's
--
certainly
the
effect
also
of
the
congress’s
rejection
of
an
amendment
which
would
have
constituted
a
limitation
on
the
1866
act.
now
the
question
then
arises,
what
kind
of
a
limitation
if
any
is
there
on
the
1866
act
so
far
as
the
matter
of
a
private
club
is
concerned.
we
would
submit
that
the
only
limitation
is
a
constitutional
limitation.
there
is
we
would
agree
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
or
freedom
of
the
association.
this
court
has
never
defined
that
in
very
explicit
terms
in
circumstances
comparable
to
these.
the
right
of
privacy
received
it's
fullest
discussion,
i
suppose
in
as
far
as
i
know
in
the
case
of
griswold
against
connecticut
which
involved
of
course
the
matter
of
birth
control
devices
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
which
was
part
of
the
penumbra
of
the
bill
of
rights,
that
has
not
been
expanded
upon
to
any
great
degree
as
far
as
i
know
in
subsequent
decisions
of
the
court.
there
have
been
holdings
that
there
is
a
constitutional
rights
of
free
association
which
is
based
on
the
first
amendment
and
that
as
a
result
associations
may
not
be
interfered,
unduly
interfered
with
as
a
result
of
state
action
or
infringement
of
their
constitutional
right
of
association,
of
their
free
association.
however,
that
issue
is
not
really
--
those
issues
are
not
really
involved
here
to
the
extent
that
they
need
to
be
the
outer
limits
or
the
privacy
need
to
be
explored
or
delineated
by
this
court.
the
real
question
here
was
resolved
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
where
the
court
held
very
clearly
that
little
hunting
park
was
not
a
private
club
because
it
had
no
program
--
no
plan
or
program
of
exclusiveness;
no
plan
or
purpose
of
exclusiveness
and
that
it
had
no
criteria
for
excluding
people
from
its
facilities,
other
than
race.
now,
we
submit
that
exactly
the
same
thing
is
true
of
wheaton-haven.
as
indicated
by
the
bylaws
and
as
indicated
by
the
record
here,
there
has
never
been
a
basis,
any
ground,
there
have
never
been
any
grounds
for
excluding
people
that
have
been
--
that
are
in
any
way
reflected
in
the
record.
there
is
indication
that
one
person
in
this
association's
10-year
history
was
excluded,
the
record
doesn't
indicate
why.
it
doesn't
indicate
the
person's
race,
it
doesn't
indicate
where
the
person
lived,
whether
he
might
have
been
outside
the
geographic
area
and
indeed,
it
doesn't
indicate
whether
he
might
have
been
afflicted
with
some
dreaded
disease,
which
would
make
his
presence
in
the
swimming
pool
undesirable.
so,
there
is
no
record
of
excluding
people.
there
are
no
criteria
anywhere
that
could
indicate
that
the
association
had
intended
to
exclude
people
so
long
as
they
lived
within
the
prescribed
geographic
area.
with
respect
to
the
1964
act,
there
has
been
some
questions
as
to
just
what
meaning
should
be
given
to
this
private
club
exemption
in
the
1964
act?
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
as
a
practical
matter,
although
the
--
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
the
exemption
in
the
1964
--
from
the
1964
act
should
be
read
to
be
coextensive
with
the
constitutional
limitation,
which
as
i
say,
i
would
concede
applies
to
the
1866
act.
i
say
that
on
a
basis
of
the
statutory
history,
the
congressional
history,
which
we
have
eluded
to
in
our
reply
brief,
where
senator
humphrey,
who
is
the
floor
manager
for
the
1964
civil
rights
act
in
explaining
the
exemption
for
private
clubs
stated
that
it
was
intended
to
protect
only
the
genuine
privacy
of
private
clubs,
whose
membership
is
genuinely
selected.
well
that
language
certainly,
parallels
very
closely
the
language
of
this
court
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park
and
it
seemed
that
there
would
be
no
basis
for
creating
different
criteria
or
a
different
right
of
privacy.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
error
of
reading
the
statutory
provision
as
a
limitation
on
the
1866
law.
there
have
been
references
made
in
the
briefs
and
of
course,
the
question
naturally
arises
in
anyone's
mind
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
famous
moose
lodge
case,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
quite
recently.
and
of
course,
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
moose
lodge,
between
wheaton-haven
and
the
moose
lodge
is
like
the
difference
between
day
and
night.
the
constitution
of
the
moose
lodge
organization
specifically
states
that
membership
is
restricted
to
male
persons
of
the
caucasian
or
white
race
above
the
age
of
21
years
and
not
married
to
someone
of
any
other
than
the
caucasian
or
white
race,
who
are
of
good
moral
character,
physically
and
mentally
normal,
who
shall
profess
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being.
moose
by
its
own
definition,
is
exclusionary,
it's
a
traditional
fraternal
organization.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
of
course,
of
course.
obviously,
that
case
involves
state
action
and
i
only
cited
it
because
it
has
been
relied
on
by
the
respondents
here,
that
is
to
suggest
that
because
the
court
indict
him
or
i
guess,
really
assumed
in
that
they
didn't
indict
in
the
court,
the
basic
assumption
in
that
case
was
that
moose
lodge
a
private
organization
and
i
am
simply
saying
that,
that
so
be
it
but
that
this
wheaton-haven
is
wholly
distinguishable
as
an
organization,
simply
because
wheaton-haven
has
no
exclusionary
criteria
of
the
sort
that
exists
in
moose
lodge.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
the
only
one.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
none
other,
no
sir,
and
it's
open
specifically
by
its
own
bylaws
to
everyone
else
within
that
parameter.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
no,
not
specifically
sir.
the
option
is
merely
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
property
interests
that
is
involved
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
essentially.
although
the
option,
well,
i
don't
mean
to
say
it
would
be
the
same,
but
the
option
is
one
of
the
indicia
of
the
fact
that
the
pool
membership
here
is
an
incident
of
real
property
in
that
neighborhood.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
yes.
but
that
membership
approval,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
has
ever
been
utilized
other
than
in
the
one
instance
that
we
referred
to.
but
certainly
by
making
that
option,
putting
that
option
in
there,
it
adds
to
the
inducement
of
persons
to
buy
a
membership
and
it
increases
the
attraction
and
value
of
homes
in
the
neighborhood.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
think
that
they
could
utilize,
yes,
the
kinds
of
reasons
that
you
are
discussing,
chronic
alcoholic,
a
person
with
a
dreaded
skin
disease
or
a
person
who
lives
outside
the
geographic
area.
but
those
are
criteria
which
are
comparable
to
those
which
the
proprietor
--
i
say
comparable
to
those,
that
the
proprietor
of
any
business
might
use,
he
can
exclude
persons
and
not
that
this
is
a
business,
but
it's
an
accommodation.
the
proprietor
of
any
public
accommodation
can
exclude
persons
who
are
going
to
be
disruptive,
who
perhaps
don't
wear
a
necktie,
if
you
go
to
a
restaurant.
there
are
reasons
why
a
place
can
draw
lines
as
to
a
kind
of
the
patrons
it
wants,
but
that
doesn't
indicate
that
it
has
an
absolute
right
of
privacy
which
is
exempts
it

he
can
become
a
member
if
the
membership
rolls
are
open,
that
is
not
--
haven’t
exceeded
the
limit
and
so
long
as
the
number
of
persons
from
outside
the
three
quarter
mile
limit
do
not
exceed
the
30%
of
its
total
membership.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well
usually
they
were
not.
although
at
the
time
of
the
events
here
in
they
were
full,
they
were
at
the
325
of
limit.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
just
like
to
say
very
briefly
that
the
important
thing
here
to
consider
and
which
has
been
stressed
in
the
plaintiff’s
briefs
and
has
been
stressed
in
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
justice
department
in
this
case
is
that
these
community
recreational
facilities
of
the
type
that
is
involved
here
are
not
country
clubs
or
fraternal
organizations
or
sororities.
they
are
organizations
established
as
the
records
shows
here
to
serve
the
community
and
i
submit
that
if
in
this
day
of
--
where
there
is
a
governmental
policy
attempting
to
foster
a
free
and
open
housing
for
example,
there
can
be
no
more
significant
and
detrimental
poignant
badge
of
slavery
than
to
have
a
situation
where
everyone
in
the
neighborhood
is
eligible
to
use
local
community
swimming
pool
except
the
black
family
that
happens
to
move
in
that
neighborhood
and
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
here.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
at
the
time,
in
the
early
days,
at
the
time
wheaton-haven
was
first
organized,
the
record
shows
that
there
were
no
public
pools
and
indeed
the
organizers
had
asked
the
county
authorities
about
that
to
build
the
public
pool
in
that
area
and
they
were
told
we
cannot
afford
to,
we
are
too
busy
building
schools
and
consequently
they
went
ahead
and
built
this
pool
in
the
local
community,
that
is
on
the
record.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
oh
yes,
there
is
a
--
well,
there
is
a
single
block,
one
level
frame
building
which
is
where
they
keep
their
facilities
i
guess
or
keep
their
tools
and
the
equipment
and
pumping
equipment,
and
filters
and
so
on
and
they
have
some
vending
machines
there.
i
do
not
know
what
else
is
there,
that
is
not
reflected
in
the
record,
sir.
but
there
is
no
club
house
to
the
social
activity
on
the
premises.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
the
record
shows
that
there
was
service
of
foods
from
these
vending
machines
for
people
who
were
admitted
of
course
to
the
premises
and
this
is
the
whole
basis
or
one
basis
for
our
assertion
that
they
are
covered
by
the
1964
public
accommodations
act
which
if
you
would
“hinges”
on
the
service
of
food
or
the
existence
of
other
kinds
of
equipment
which
are
passed
on
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
is
why
we
asserted
jurisdiction
under
the
1964
act.
i
would
just
like
to
say
in
closing
that
the
association
here,
as
the
record
will
show
made
a
commitment
to
the
people
who
were
originally
solicited
to
join,
it
made
a
commitment
to
the
public
authorities
in
montgomery
county
that
it
would
provide
a
public
community
service
facility
and
we
submit
that
now
those
same
--
the
people
who
are
in
charge
of
this
facility
are
attempting
to
convert
it
from
a
community
facility
into
a
haven
for
whites.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that
is
sir,
in
a
decision
of
the
montgomery
county
commission
on
human
relations
–
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
right,
which
is
in
the
record
was
submitted
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
received
it
and
considered
it.
so,
there
are
certain
findings
which
were
made
by
that
human
relations
commission
which
are
included
in
the
record,
were
in
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
number
of
those
finding
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
were
in
fact
stipulated
--
not
stipulated
to,
but
they
were
brought
out
in
the
course
of
discovery
in
interrogatories
and
admissions.
so,
there
really
is
no
--
they
are
in
the
record
in
that
way,
if
not
through
the
human
relations
commission’s
decision.
