mr.
john
h.
mudd
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
mr.
ernest
mcintyre,
one
of
the
respondents
in
this
case,
who
previously
was
a
member
of
the
board,
who
at
this
time
finds
himself
somewhat
in
an
anomalous
situation.
the
record,
including
his
deposition
which
is
in
the
transcript,
in
the
appendix
shows
that
he,
mr.
mcintyre
was
one
of
the
members
mentioned
by
mr.
noyes,
who
favored
integration
of
the
pool
or
admission
of
negroes
to
the
pool
and
in
fact
first
met
dr.
presses
when
he
was
coaching
his
youngster
on
a
little
league
or
softball,
baseball
team
and
it
was
he
who
inquired
about
application
to
the
club.
however,
we
find
now
that
he
is
a
defendant
and
nowhere
below
as
the
court
ruled
that
he,
since
he
was
sued
only
as
a
director
should
not
have
a
part
in
these
proceedings
and
should
have
been
dismissed
because
the
lower
courts
have
not
got
into
that.
i
will
pass
this
point
quickly
because
i
want
to
get
to
the
other
points
mentioned
by
mr.
noyes,
but
i
would
say
that
mr.
mcintyre
has
no
place
in
these
proceedings
and
to
keep
an
individual
in
a
case
like
this
with
his
demonstrated
concern
as
a
matter
of
social
philosophy,
if
you
will,
would
discourage
any
individual
from
serving
in
any
community
activity
whatsoever.
but,
we
come
now
to
the
point
as
to
whether
the
verdict
or
judgments
below
should
be
affirmed
and
i
think
we
come
to
the
one
point
which
has
been
the
issue
running
through
the
briefs
and
that
is
whether
wheaton-haven
is
not
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
but
a
private
club
or
other
establishment,
not
in
fact
open
to
the
public.
now,
i
do
not
have
the
time,
nor
do
i
think
the
point
necessitates
taking
time
to
demonstrate
that
in
fact
this
swimming
pool
was
not
open
to
the
public.
it
was
created,
formed,
controlled,
financed
by
members.
the
applications
were
voted
on
by
members,
either
at
a
board
meeting
or
at
a
membership
of
the
whole.
it
was
not
a
type
of
membership
as
in
little
hunting
park
that
followed
the
real
estate.
we
had
70%
within
this
three
mile
area,
three
mile
radius,
30%
would
be
outside
of
the
area.
the
sale
on
a
house
did
not
ipso
facto
mean
that
the
purchaser
became
a
member
of
the
pool.
the
seller
of
the
house
turned
his
membership
in,
yes
he
did
have
an
option,
the
buyer.
but
the
membership
flowed
back
to
the
cooperation
which
had
the
obligation
to
buy
it
on
90%
or
80%
depending
on
whether
the
membership
was
full.
now,
we
come
to
one
thing
that
i
think
is
most
important
to
fulfill
the
oral
arguments
and
i
do
not
wish
to
repeat
the
points
that
have
been
made
in
the
briefs.
below,
in
the
district
court,
when
this
case
started,
mr.
brown
and
i
quote
from
the
transcript,
page
18,
“but
of
course,
for
the
question
of
whether
it
is
a
private
club,
we
will
also
concede
for
this
for
any
purpose,
would
is
also
relevant
to
section
2000
as
well
as
sections
1981
and
1982.
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
private
club,
but
if
it
is
a
private
club,
then
neither
1981,
1982
or
2000
would
apply.”
i
think
the
same
principles
would
be
applicable.
now,
we
find
in
the
reply
brief
of
mr.
brown
at
page
9,
accordingly,
wheaton-haven
at
least
falls
within
the
category
of
associations
which
even
though
private,
which
though
private
are
not
immune
from
judicial
interference,
to
remedy
injury
resulting
from
arbitrary
or
discriminatory
exclusion.
so,
we
have
a
complete
reversal
of
his
position
with
no
authority
cited
other
than
a
medical
society
case
and
a
labor
union
case
which
we
submit
is
different.
that
is
an
economic
unit,
a
professional
unit
such
as
a
bar
exam.
it
is
not
a
place
of
pleasure,
it
is
not
a
recreational
activity,
it
is
not
a
social
club
such
as
wheaton-haven.
