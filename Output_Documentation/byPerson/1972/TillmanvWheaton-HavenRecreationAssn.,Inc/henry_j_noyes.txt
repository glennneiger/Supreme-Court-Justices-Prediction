mr.
henry
j.
noyes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court
on
cross
motions
summary
judgment.
counselor
for
the
petitioners
who
has
argued
today
and
counsel
myself,
stipulated
as
all
the
facts
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
lower
court
made
its
decision.
now
those
stipulations
are
contained
in
the
transcript
which
we
have
provided
in
this
case.
i
might
say
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
in
the
record
in
this
case
have
advised
this
court
that
such
transcript
was
not
available.
that
transcript
as
we
see
it,
in
fact
as
a
matter
of
certainty
was
the
way
in
which
the
fourth
circuit
decided
this
case.
matters
have
not
crept
into
the
case
and
we
heard
arguments
today
which
can
nowhere
be
found
in
the
record.
the
matters
such
as
alleged
door
to
door
solicitation
and
the
matters
of
the
montgomery
county
council's
hearings
are
not
contained
in
the
record
in
this
case.
there
are
matters
indeed
that
have
crept
in
as
late
as
reply
brief
for
the
petitioners.
now
when
we
analyze
the
case
as
it
appeared
down
below
and
it
was
argued
in
the
fourth
circuit,
really
the
only
contention
that
the
petitioners
make
is
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
this
case
and
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park,
that
is
their
really
issue,
that
is
their
real
argument.
and
we
of
course
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
that.
rejected
it
for
very
good
reasons
after
having
this
case
under
advisement
for
over
a
year.
the
points
of
distinction
are
substantial
and
several
between
little
hunting
park
and
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
most
important,
little
hunting
park
turned
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
attempted
assignment
of
a
membership
incident
to
the
sale
or
lease
of
real
property.
you
do
not
have
that
in
this
case.
in
little
hunting
park,
freemen
moved
into
the
neighborhood
and
leased
his
home
from
sullivan
for
a
$129
a
month.
in
sullivan
the
court
found
that
at
least
a
portion
of
the
$129
was
for
the
pool
membership
because
in
sullivan,
the
member
had
a
natural
to
assign
his
membership.
in
this
case,
presses
moved
into
this
neighborhood
in
1967,
at
least
a
year
before
he
ever
had
an
idea
to
attempt
to
join
this
pool.
there
is
no
contention
that
presses
ever
attempted
to
obtain
an
assignment
from
an
existing
member.
there
is
no
contention
that
the
existing
member
ever
attempted
to
assign
a
membership
and
such
attempt
to
sign
it
was
aborted.
all
presses
says
that
he
wants
to
join.
now
presses
did
this.
presses
made
informal
request
to
one
of
the
members,
or
one
or
two
members
for
an
application.
the
directors
had
a
meeting
and
they
voted
against
presses
and
that
was
as
far
as
it
went.
then
presses
--
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
in
presses’
case
the
record
was
stipulated
and
we
do
not
deny
it.
we
stipulated
to
get
this
case
decided
on
summary
judgment
that
presses
was
denied
a
membership
because
of
his
race,
that’s
in
the
record,
we
do
not
deny
that.
and
now
--
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
at
that
point.
now
presses
however,
here
is
how
we
distinguish
little
hunting
park,
in
little
hunting
park,
first
of
all
the
board
of
directors
had
the
sole
control
over
membership.
in
wheaton-haven
presses
asked
for
an
application
and
they
would
not
give
an
application,
this
was
a
board
of
directors
vote.
however
the
bylaws
of
wheaton-haven
provide
that
any
member
at
any
meeting
can
propose
a
member
and
a
majority
of
the
members
can
elect
in
a
member.
you
don't
have
that
or
you
did
not
have
that
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park.
so
rather
than
have
tillman
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
as
a
member
propose
him
at
the
next
annual
meeting
of
members
for
membership,
he
did
not
even
bother
attempting
to
follow
that
route,
because
the
board
refused
to
give
him
an
application,
he
immediately
went
into
the
courts.
now
we
say
that
there
is
a
distinction
that
there
frankly
is
a
substantial
body,
a
substantial
group
in
wheat-haven
who
would
admit
presses
and
vote
to
admit
presses,
but
he
did
not
even
attempt
that
route.
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
poll
a
membership
by
having
mr.
tillman
propose
him
at
the
meeting.
now
special
meetings
can
be
called
by
members
and
20%
of
the
membership
can
call
a
special
meeting
at
anytime,
and
10%
of
the
membership
constitutes
a
quorum.
therefore
as
few
as
--
even
if
the
membership
was
filled
as
few
as
10%
or
325
will
constitute
a
quorum
which
could
presumably
lead
to
mr.
presses,
dr.
presses
being
voted
in
by
the
members.
one
of
things
that
is
very
important
that
there
never
was
an
attempted
assignment.
all
presses
is
saying
and
all
rosner
is
saying
is
this
in
its
simplest
form,
they
asked
the
court
to
adopt
their
propositions
as
follow;
because
of
our
race,
we
are
entitled
to
our
membership,
and
we
are
entitled
to
be
guests
when
similarly
situated
white
citizens
do
not
enjoy
such
right.
those
facts
are
admitted
in
the
record
before
the
district
court.
when
counsel
in
an
answer
to
the
question
posed
by
the
district
court
conceded
that
white
citizens
would
not
have
the
same
right
that
presses
and
rosner
now
press
before
this
court.
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
well
--
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
he
asked
to
have
an
application
to
–
well,
in
asking
for
application
he
indicated
he
wanted
to
join.
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
he
was
denied
the
application
by
the
end
effect
he
was
told
formally
or
informally,
that
at
that
time,
even
if
an
application
was
given,
it
would
not
approved,
we
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
it’s
a
point
of
distinction
between
the
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
and
this
case.
the
petitioners
are
relying
almost
solely
on
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
which
was
a
transfer
--
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
it
was
not
in
that
case,
but
it
is
in
this
case.
it
was
not
in
that
case
because
in
sullivan,
the
sole
way
a
person
could
get
a
membership
was
through
the
board
of
directors.
in
this
particular
case,
the
members
can
vote
the
person
in
this
is
a
point
of
distinction
that
we
raise,
although
its
the
most
substantial
point.
the
most
substantial
point
we
say
is
that
this
was
not
an
attempted
assignment
incident
to
the
sale
or
lease
of
real
property,
that
is
the
difference.
there
was
an
attempted
direct
application
to
the
membership
by
dr.
mrs.
presses.
it
was
a
direct
attempt
by
rosner,
saying
she
is
entitled
to
be
a
guest
even
though
the
uniformly
applied
bylaws
limit
guest
privileges
to
relatives
of
members.
there
has
never
been
any
contention
that
those
aren't
uniformly
applied.
now
this
first
option
statement
was
rejected
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
reading
the
bylaws
of
little
hunting
park
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
as
compared
to
the
bylaws
in
wheaton-haven,
there
is
no
first
option.
at
all
the
relevant
times
in
these
proceedings
the
membership
has
not
been
filled,
that
is
the
matter
of
fact
in
this
record.
now
if
the
membership
is
filled,
the
wheaton-haven
bylaws
say
that
the
club
shall,
shall
buy
back
the
membership
at
90%
of
the
initiation
fee
and
then
a
person
who
was
buying
a
home
of
that
resigning
member
would
have
the
first
option
to
buy
that,
subject
to
the
approval
of
board
of
directors.
but
in
cases
when
the
membership
is
not
filled
which
is
what
we
have
here
and
have
had
at
all
the
relevant
times
in
these
proceedings,
the
club
may,
the
bylaws
say
may
buy
back
this
membership,
strictly
whether
they
want
to
do
it
or
not,
it's
strictly
up
to
club.
they
are
not
required
to
buy
back.
now
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
you
had
absolute
right
to
assign
or
transfer
membership.
you
do
not
have
that
in
wheaton-haven.
in
wheaton-haven
when
a
person
desires
to
resign,
he
has
to
submit
a
written
resignation
and
if
the
club
is
not
filled
as
we
have
it
now,
the
club
may
or
may
not
buy
it
back.
you
had
no
such
provision
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park.
if
a
member
attempted
to
assign
his
membership
and
the
club
would
not
approve
it,
that
meant
he
had
no
way
of
disposing
or
getting
any
money
out
of
his
membership.
there
is
no
situation
in
wheaton-haven
where
a
contractual
relationship
could
arise,
no
way,
between
an
existing
member
and
a
prospective
member.
there
is
no
way
that
a
contract
could
arise
under
the
bylaws.
now
there
is
significance,
attempt
to
be
laid
on
the
fact
that
supposedly
during
entire
history
of
this
club,
that
the
record
only
indicates
one
rejection
of
one
person,
and
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates
that
person
was
a
white
person,
some
great
significance
is
laid
up
on
this.
the
fourth
circuit
dealt
with
this
and
the
district
court
dealt
with
this,
in
stating
the
more
subtle
ways
that
private
clubs
operate.
once
a
person
gets
an
application
the
approvals,
usually
a
proforma
type
of
thing.
we
do
not
keep
rate
of
rejections
of
members.
the
petitioners
would
have
us
believe
or
have
the
court
believe
that
throughout
the
history
of
this
club
there
has
been
a
long
record
of
exclusiveness
of
negroes
and
no
exclusion
of
white
persons.
yet
the
record
shows
no
prior
exclusions
of
negroes
or
white
people.
it
shows
one
rejection
and
that
was
a
situation
which
is
unusual
where
the
application
has
been
found
and
then
rejected,
but
we
do
not
generally
reach
that
point.
now
we
therefore
say
your
honors
that
in
this
case,
it
really
boils
down
to
whether
or
not
the
court
would
pigeonhole
wheaton-haven
into
little
hunting
park
and
the
briefs
and
facts
that
i
have
stated
indicates
it
is
entirely
different.
now
as
to
2000
(a)
of
the
public
accommodations
law,
the
record
will
indicate
that
the
counsel
in
the
district
court,
substantially
if
not
totally
abandoned
this
argument
under
that
concept.
at
one
point
the
counsel
said,
that
the
only
issue
is
whether
there
is
a
link
between
the
association
in
interstate
commerce,
that
was
on
page
61.
another
point
he
stated
that
if
wheaton-haven
is
a
private
club
we
can
see
that
neither
sections
1981
or
1982
or
2000
(a)
apply.
they
said
of
course
we
believe
this
is
not
a
private
club,
but
if
it
is
a
private
club
than
we
are
out
on
all
three
statues
and
of
course
if
it
is
a
private
club
they'd
be
out
under
little
hunting
park
too,
because
little
hunting
park
was
decided
under
section
1982.
in
regard
to
the
counsel’s
statement
that
this
--
the
court
found
little
hunting
park
to
be
a
private
club
or
a
public
operation,
we
do
not
read
the
case
that
way.
the
court
did,
in
one
paragraph
stated
there
is
no
plan
or
purpose
of
exclusiveness,
but
the
court
did
not
say
it
was
a
public
accommodation.
that
case
was
decided
on
the
transfer
or
attempted
transfer
of
membership
incident
to
the
sale
or
lease
of
real
property.
now
as
to
membership
at
this
time,
the
way
that
bylaws
are
structured,
anybody
in
the
united
states
who
we
deem
or
we
want
to
admit
can
be
a
member,
or
not
restricted
to
a
three
quarter
mile
area
until
and
unless
the
membership
is
filled.
and
in
closing
i
would
simply
point
this
out
to
the
court,
as
far
as
exclusiveness
is
concerned,
again
the
petitioner’s
attempt
to
lay
heavy
stress
on
the
fact
that
allegedly
one
person
was
turned
down
over
the
years.
however,
this
club
is
situated
in
the
wheaton
area
which
is
about
12-13
miles
above
the
district
line.
homes
from
the
district
line
are
out
for
many,
many
miles
or
as
thick
as
they
can
be
placed,
there
is
practically
no
available
land.
at
this
time
we
can
take
members
because
our
membership
is
not
filled,
we
can
take
memberships
from
anyone
in
montgomery
county,
the
district
of
columbia,
prince
george's
county
and
in
the
surrounding
virginia
areas
and
indeed
california.
yet
our
membership
remains
below
the
maximum
of
325.
it
was
the
same
axiomatic
that
if
we
desire
to
fill
those
memberships
by
running
an
ad
in
the
newspaper
if
we
were
in
fact
such
a
public
operation
then
we
would
fill
the
thing
tomorrow.
my
people
prefer
to
keep
their
club
at
the
present
amount
of
some
260-265,
and
despite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
got
potential
membership,
potential
area
to
draw
members,
some
rough
guess
to
5
million
people.
we
say
that
this
is
not
a
public
accommodation.
the
record
shows
it
is
not.
the
record
in
the
well
reasoned
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
shows
that
the
little
hunting
park
does
not
apply.
we
respectfully
urge
upon
your
honors
to
sustain
the
opinions
of
both
lower
courts.
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court
on
cross
motions
summary
judgment.
counselor
for
the
petitioners
who
has
argued
today
and
counsel
myself,
stipulated
as
all
the
facts
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
lower
court
made
its
decision.
now
those
stipulations
are
contained
in
the
transcript
which
we
have
provided
in
this
case.
i
might
say
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
in
the
record
in
this
case
have
advised
this
court
that
such
transcript
was
not
available.
that
transcript
as
we
see
it,
in
fact
as
a
matter
of
certainty
was
the
way
in
which
the
fourth
circuit
decided
this
case.
matters
have
not
crept
into
the
case
and
we
heard
arguments
today
which
can
nowhere
be
found
in
the
record.
the
matters
such
as
alleged
door
to
door
solicitation
and
the
matters
of
the
montgomery
county
council's
hearings
are
not
contained
in
the
record
in
this
case.
there
are
matters
indeed
that
have
crept
in
as
late
as
reply
brief
for
the
petitioners.
now
when
we
analyze
the
case
as
it
appeared
down
below
and
it
was
argued
in
the
fourth
circuit,
really
the
only
contention
that
the
petitioners
make
is
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
this
case
and
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park,
that
is
their
really
issue,
that
is
their
real
argument.
and
we
of
course
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
that.
rejected
it
for
very
good
reasons
after
having
this
case
under
advisement
for
over
a
year.
the
points
of
distinction
are
substantial
and
several
between
little
hunting
park
and
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
most
important,
little
hunting
park
turned
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
attempted
assignment
of
a
membership
incident
to
the
sale
or
lease
of
real
property.
you
do
not
have
that
in
this
case.
in
little
hunting
park,
freemen
moved
into
the
neighborhood
and
leased
his
home
from
sullivan
for
a
$129
a
month.
in
sullivan
the
court
found
that
at
least
a
portion
of
the
$129
was
for
the
pool
membership
because
in
sullivan,
the
member
had
a
natural
to
assign
his
membership.
in
this
case,
presses
moved
into
this
neighborhood
in
1967,
at
least
a
year
before
he
ever
had
an
idea
to
attempt
to
join
this
pool.
there
is
no
contention
that
presses
ever
attempted
to
obtain
an
assignment
from
an
existing
member.
there
is
no
contention
that
the
existing
member
ever
attempted
to
assign
a
membership
and
such
attempt
to
sign
it
was
aborted.
all
presses
says
that
he
wants
to
join.
now
presses
did
this.
presses
made
informal
request
to
one
of
the
members,
or
one
or
two
members
for
an
application.
the
directors
had
a
meeting
and
they
voted
against
presses
and
that
was
as
far
as
it
went.
then
presses
--
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
in
presses’
case
the
record
was
stipulated
and
we
do
not
deny
it.
we
stipulated
to
get
this
case
decided
on
summary
judgment
that
presses
was
denied
a
membership
because
of
his
race,
that’s
in
the
record,
we
do
not
deny
that.
and
now
--
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
at
that
point.
now
presses
however,
here
is
how
we
distinguish
little
hunting
park,
in
little
hunting
park,
first
of
all
the
board
of
directors
had
the
sole
control
over
membership.
in
wheaton-haven
presses
asked
for
an
application
and
they
would
not
give
an
application,
this
was
a
board
of
directors
vote.
however
the
bylaws
of
wheaton-haven
provide
that
any
member
at
any
meeting
can
propose
a
member
and
a
majority
of
the
members
can
elect
in
a
member.
you
don't
have
that
or
you
did
not
have
that
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park.
so
rather
than
have
tillman
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
as
a
member
propose
him
at
the
next
annual
meeting
of
members
for
membership,
he
did
not
even
bother
attempting
to
follow
that
route,
because
the
board
refused
to
give
him
an
application,
he
immediately
went
into
the
courts.
now
we
say
that
there
is
a
distinction
that
there
frankly
is
a
substantial
body,
a
substantial
group
in
wheat-haven
who
would
admit
presses
and
vote
to
admit
presses,
but
he
did
not
even
attempt
that
route.
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
poll
a
membership
by
having
mr.
tillman
propose
him
at
the
meeting.
now
special
meetings
can
be
called
by
members
and
20%
of
the
membership
can
call
a
special
meeting
at
anytime,
and
10%
of
the
membership
constitutes
a
quorum.
therefore
as
few
as
--
even
if
the
membership
was
filled
as
few
as
10%
or
325
will
constitute
a
quorum
which
could
presumably
lead
to
mr.
presses,
dr.
presses
being
voted
in
by
the
members.
one
of
things
that
is
very
important
that
there
never
was
an
attempted
assignment.
all
presses
is
saying
and
all
rosner
is
saying
is
this
in
its
simplest
form,
they
asked
the
court
to
adopt
their
propositions
as
follow;
because
of
our
race,
we
are
entitled
to
our
membership,
and
we
are
entitled
to
be
guests
when
similarly
situated
white
citizens
do
not
enjoy
such
right.
those
facts
are
admitted
in
the
record
before
the
district
court.
when
counsel
in
an
answer
to
the
question
posed
by
the
district
court
conceded
that
white
citizens
would
not
have
the
same
right
that
presses
and
rosner
now
press
before
this
court.
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
well
--
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
he
asked
to
have
an
application
to
–
well,
in
asking
for
application
he
indicated
he
wanted
to
join.
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
he
was
denied
the
application
by
the
end
effect
he
was
told
formally
or
informally,
that
at
that
time,
even
if
an
application
was
given,
it
would
not
approved,
we
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
it’s
a
point
of
distinction
between
the
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
and
this
case.
the
petitioners
are
relying
almost
solely
on
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
which
was
a
transfer
--
mr.
henry
j.
noyes
it
was
not
in
that
case,
but
it
is
in
this
case.
it
was
not
in
that
case
because
in
sullivan,
the
sole
way
a
person
could
get
a
membership
was
through
the
board
of
directors.
in
this
particular
case,
the
members
can
vote
the
person
in
this
is
a
point
of
distinction
that
we
raise,
although
its
the
most
substantial
point.
the
most
substantial
point
we
say
is
that
this
was
not
an
attempted
assignment
incident
to
the
sale
or
lease
of
real
property,
that
is
the
difference.
there
was
an
attempted
direct
application
to
the
membership
by
dr.
mrs.
presses.
it
was
a
direct
attempt
by
rosner,
saying
she
is
entitled
to
be
a
guest
even
though
the
uniformly
applied
bylaws
limit
guest
privileges
to
relatives
of
members.
there
has
never
been
any
contention
that
those
aren't
uniformly
applied.
now
this
first
option
statement
was
rejected
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
reading
the
bylaws
of
little
hunting
park
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
as
compared
to
the
bylaws
in
wheaton-haven,
there
is
no
first
option.
at
all
the
relevant
times
in
these
proceedings
the
membership
has
not
been
filled,
that
is
the
matter
of
fact
in
this
record.
now
if
the
membership
is
filled,
the
wheaton-haven
bylaws
say
that
the
club
shall,
shall
buy
back
the
membership
at
90%
of
the
initiation
fee
and
then
a
person
who
was
buying
a
home
of
that
resigning
member
would
have
the
first
option
to
buy
that,
subject
to
the
approval
of
board
of
directors.
but
in
cases
when
the
membership
is
not
filled
which
is
what
we
have
here
and
have
had
at
all
the
relevant
times
in
these
proceedings,
the
club
may,
the
bylaws
say
may
buy
back
this
membership,
strictly
whether
they
want
to
do
it
or
not,
it's
strictly
up
to
club.
they
are
not
required
to
buy
back.
now
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
you
had
absolute
right
to
assign
or
transfer
membership.
you
do
not
have
that
in
wheaton-haven.
in
wheaton-haven
when
a
person
desires
to
resign,
he
has
to
submit
a
written
resignation
and
if
the
club
is
not
filled
as
we
have
it
now,
the
club
may
or
may
not
buy
it
back.
you
had
no
such
provision
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park.
if
a
member
attempted
to
assign
his
membership
and
the
club
would
not
approve
it,
that
meant
he
had
no
way
of
disposing
or
getting
any
money
out
of
his
membership.
there
is
no
situation
in
wheaton-haven
where
a
contractual
relationship
could
arise,
no
way,
between
an
existing
member
and
a
prospective
member.
there
is
no
way
that
a
contract
could
arise
under
the
bylaws.
now
there
is
significance,
attempt
to
be
laid
on
the
fact
that
supposedly
during
entire
history
of
this
club,
that
the
record
only
indicates
one
rejection
of
one
person,
and
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates
that
person
was
a
white
person,
some
great
significance
is
laid
up
on
this.
the
fourth
circuit
dealt
with
this
and
the
district
court
dealt
with
this,
in
stating
the
more
subtle
ways
that
private
clubs
operate.
once
a
person
gets
an
application
the
approvals,
usually
a
proforma
type
of
thing.
we
do
not
keep
rate
of
rejections
of
members.
the
petitioners
would
have
us
believe
or
have
the
court
believe
that
throughout
the
history
of
this
club
there
has
been
a
long
record
of
exclusiveness
of
negroes
and
no
exclusion
of
white
persons.
yet
the
record
shows
no
prior
exclusions
of
negroes
or
white
people.
it
shows
one
rejection
and
that
was
a
situation
which
is
unusual
where
the
application
has
been
found
and
then
rejected,
but
we
do
not
generally
reach
that
point.
now
we
therefore
say
your
honors
that
in
this
case,
it
really
boils
down
to
whether
or
not
the
court
would
pigeonhole
wheaton-haven
into
little
hunting
park
and
the
briefs
and
facts
that
i
have
stated
indicates
it
is
entirely
different.
now
as
to
2000
(a)
of
the
public
accommodations
law,
the
record
will
indicate
that
the
counsel
in
the
district
court,
substantially
if
not
totally
abandoned
this
argument
under
that
concept.
at
one
point
the
counsel
said,
that
the
only
issue
is
whether
there
is
a
link
between
the
association
in
interstate
commerce,
that
was
on
page
61.
another
point
he
stated
that
if
wheaton-haven
is
a
private
club
we
can
see
that
neither
sections
1981
or
1982
or
2000
(a)
apply.
they
said
of
course
we
believe
this
is
not
a
private
club,
but
if
it
is
a
private
club
than
we
are
out
on
all
three
statues
and
of
course
if
it
is
a
private
club
they'd
be
out
under
little
hunting
park
too,
because
little
hunting
park
was
decided
under
section
1982.
in
regard
to
the
counsel’s
statement
that
this
--
the
court
found
little
hunting
park
to
be
a
private
club
or
a
public
operation,
we
do
not
read
the
case
that
way.
the
court
did,
in
one
paragraph
stated
there
is
no
plan
or
purpose
of
exclusiveness,
but
the
court
did
not
say
it
was
a
public
accommodation.
that
case
was
decided
on
the
transfer
or
attempted
transfer
of
membership
incident
to
the
sale
or
lease
of
real
property.
now
as
to
membership
at
this
time,
the
way
that
bylaws
are
structured,
anybody
in
the
united
states
who
we
deem
or
we
want
to
admit
can
be
a
member,
or
not
restricted
to
a
three
quarter
mile
area
until
and
unless
the
membership
is
filled.
and
in
closing
i
would
simply
point
this
out
to
the
court,
as
far
as
exclusiveness
is
concerned,
again
the
petitioner’s
attempt
to
lay
heavy
stress
on
the
fact
that
allegedly
one
person
was
turned
down
over
the
years.
however,
this
club
is
situated
in
the
wheaton
area
which
is
about
12-13
miles
above
the
district
line.
homes
from
the
district
line
are
out
for
many,
many
miles
or
as
thick
as
they
can
be
placed,
there
is
practically
no
available
land.
at
this
time
we
can
take
members
because
our
membership
is
not
filled,
we
can
take
memberships
from
anyone
in
montgomery
county,
the
district
of
columbia,
prince
george's
county
and
in
the
surrounding
virginia
areas
and
indeed
california.
yet
our
membership
remains
below
the
maximum
of
325.
it
was
the
same
axiomatic
that
if
we
desire
to
fill
those
memberships
by
running
an
ad
in
the
newspaper
if
we
were
in
fact
such
a
public
operation
then
we
would
fill
the
thing
tomorrow.
my
people
prefer
to
keep
their
club
at
the
present
amount
of
some
260-265,
and
despite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
got
potential
membership,
potential
area
to
draw
members,
some
rough
guess
to
5
million
people.
we
say
that
this
is
not
a
public
accommodation.
the
record
shows
it
is
not.
the
record
in
the
well
reasoned
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
shows
that
the
little
hunting
park
does
not
apply.
we
respectfully
urge
upon
your
honors
to
sustain
the
opinions
of
both
lower
courts.
