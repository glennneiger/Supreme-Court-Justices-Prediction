mr.
mackey
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
all
the
things
that
you
just
said
true
of
a
large
area
of
what
we
vaguely
call
circumstantial
evidence,
evidence
of
circumstances?
you
can't
--
you
don't
have
confrontation
in
the
sense
you
are
arguing,
when
you
are
confronted
with
a
set
of
circumstances
and
isn't
this
very
close
to
a
circumstance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
on
page
11,
bottom
of
page
11
in
trial,
you
say,
his
defense
is
that
certain
parties
gave
him
these
checks
as
payment
for
furniture.
could
you
enlarge
on
that
a
little
bit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
spoke
of
his
putting
a
stamp
on
that
check
and
putting
it
in
his
bank
account.
something
else
had
to
happen
before
that,
didn't
it?
there
had
to
be
an
endorsement
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
named
payee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
the
handwriting
expert
said,
he
signed
it
and
was
there
not
an
admission
through
the
postal
inspector
that
he
said
he
had
signed
the
payee's
name
for
the
check?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
your
response
to
justice
marshall
relating
to
the
"clarence
smith"
check,
is
that
the
check
concerning
the
expert
testimony
of
the
handwriting
expert?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
didn't
the
postal
inspector
testify
that
barnes
admitted
forging,
signing,
the
name
"clarence
smith"
to
the
checks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that's
an
additional
evidence
besides
the
handwriting
expert,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
friedman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
well
recall
which
did
as
mr.
justice
white
said
as
usual
opposed
the
grant
of
the
petition,
but
now
that
it's
here
in
light
of
the
fifth
circuit,
is
this
in
your
view
something
that
ought
to
be
clarified
for
the
benefit
of
the
fifth
circuit,
if
no
one
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
approximately
one-third
of
all
the
federal
district
judges
in
the
country
are
bound
by
the
fifth
circuit
holding,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mackey
do
you
have
any
thing
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
leary
case
involved
a
presumption
and
not
an
inference,
did
it
not?
chief
justice

e.

thank
you

the
case
is
