justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
am
looking
at
page
6
of
your
brief
and
i
am
puzzled.
next
to
the
last
paragraph,
“defendant
admitted
that
having
possession
on
the
checks,
but
denied
that
he
knew
they
were
stolen
and
denied
the
forgery
or
uttering
of
these
checks.”
where
was
that
denial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
are
telling
me,
i
gather
mr.
mackey
that
this
paragraph
in
your
brief
refers
to
testimony
of
the
postal
inspector.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
did
he
out
on
any
evidence
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing.
no
witnesses
take
the
stand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
go
is
that
published?
justice
william
j.

the
first

william
j.
brennan,

i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
friedman
did
the
judge
then
required
in
his
instructions
deal
with
his
attempted
explanation
in
the
form
of
a
house
master?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
comment
generally
on
any
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
logging
at
all
that
he
is
really
in
opposition
to
attack
the
instructions
since
in
fact
he
relies
on
what
the
postmaster
and
the
inspector
testified
as
was
his
explanation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
an
explanation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
had
approved
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
said
there
is
so
much
more,
should
we
address
ourselves
to
the
question
of
the
inference
as
such?
on
a
hypothetical
as
justice
white
just
put
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
mr.
friedman
is
it
possible,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
cameron
case,
but
that
gather
it
falls
under
this
hypothetical
that
mr.
justice
white
put
to
you,
is
it
possible
that
that
case
could
be
affirmed
and
this
one
also?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
in
fact
mr.
friedman
under
the
--
is
the
issue
really
here,
why
do
we
have
to
decide
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
this
could
--
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
this
a
candidate
for
dismissal
as
improvidently
granted?
