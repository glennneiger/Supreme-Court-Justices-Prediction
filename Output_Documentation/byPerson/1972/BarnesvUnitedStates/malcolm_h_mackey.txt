mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
other
members
of
the
court,
i'll
try
to
keep
my
argument
relatively
brief.
most
of
my
argument,
of
course,
is
in
the
brief
submitted.
i
did
--
i
do
wish
to
point
out,
though
i
haven't
filed
a
reply
brief,
i
do
wish
to
point
out
that
i
did
discover
a
law
review
article,
stanford
law
review
article
and
i
would
like
to
mention
it
to
the
court,
volume
23,
pages,
it's
a
rather
long
article,
341
to
355,
reviews
the
and
i
just
discovered
it
in
going
through
the
argument,
hits
it
on,
i
don't
think
it
changes,
it
does
have
some
reflection,
but
i
call
it
hits
it
right
on
the
button
as
to
these
presumptions,
so
called
inferences
that
we
are
talking
about.
that
article
and
i
bring
it
up
at
this
point,
states
that
there
were
three
reasons
why
the
rational
connection
test
fails.
one
that
the
right
allows
the
prosecution
to
get
it's
case
to
the
jury
without
producing
any
evidence
of
a
prohibitive
effect
of
a
material
element
of
the
crime.
two,
that
the
presumption
of
the
evidence
is
insufficient
evidence
to
justify
a
finding
of
reasonable
doubt
and
that,
generally
flatly
this
article
states
that
rational
connection
or
not
all
of
these
presumptions
or
inferences
are
unconstitutional
as
in
giving
sort
of
a
directed
verdict
for
the
prosecution
on
the
one
element
of
the
crime.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
pure
unadulterated
constitution
fifth
amendment,
“no
person
should
be
compelled
as
a
witness”
and
we
look
at
that
little
sentence
or
segment
of
the
sentence,
we
find
that,
compelled
to
--
against
the
witness
himself,
we
find
nothing
about
a
rational
connection
test
naturally
and
going
to
the
sixth
amendment
which
says
that
“no
one
shall
be
confronted.”
they
will
be
confronted
with
witnesses
against
them
and
in
this
case,
i
think,
we
are
confronted
with
an
inference
against
them
which
says
as
in
the
barnes
case,
mr.
barnes
to
not
take
the
witness
stand
and
he
is
confronted
with
this
problem
of
getting
over
the
hurdle.
if
he
takes
the
witness
stand,
of
course,
he
puts
himself
in
pandora's
box
into
the
fire
and
then
i
don't
think
he
can
use
the
constitutional
prohibitions.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
it's
close
with
distinctions,
naturally
circumstantial
evidence,
you
don't
have
to
see
the
boy
eating
the
cookie,
if
you
see
the
broken
cookie
jar,
that's
the
old,
the
cookie
jar
analogy.
you
see
the
boy
with
a
cookie
jar
and
you
see
cookies
on
his
face,
that's
circumstantial
evidence.
but
aren't
we
doing
something
else
with
the
inferences?
aren't
we
saying
that
this
--
we're
applying
knowledge
to
it
and
that's
the
problem
that
i
see.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction.
we
have
circumstantial
evidence.
certainly
in
civil
law,
we
have
this
situation,
you
can
put
a
person
on
and
we
don't
have
any
constitutional
probation,
you
can
call
a
person
under
776
of
the
evidence
code
in
california
and
put
him
on
and
elicit
all
the
information
from.
we
have
(inaudible)
with
it
where
we
have
presumed
that
certain
elements
in
a
civil
case.
i
don't
think
that
these
elements,
we
could
say,
a
person
who
is
(inaudible)
with
one
of
these
mafia
groups.
that
his
presence
there
is
some
evidence
that
he
knows
the
conspiracy
that's
going
on.
but
i
don't
think
we
want
to
do
that.
i
don't
think
that
we
want
to
limit
the
constitution.
therefore,
i
feel
that
we
should
knock
out
these
inferences
or
as
in
the
roger's
case,
no
matter
how
piously,
and
the
court
said,
in
that
case,
no
matter
how
piously
we
state
to
the
contrary
that
these
inferences
are
in
the
jury's
mind,
that
they
could
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
no
he
did
not.
that's
a
distinction
in
counsel's
case,
they
cite
and
i
want
to
point
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
let
me
state
it
this
way
to
clear
it
out
mr.
justice.
number
one,
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
they
had
the
fbi
inspector,
the
postal
inspector
took
the
stand
and
testified
as
to
the
conversation
that
he
had
with
the
defendant
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
--
and
this
is
the
great
distinction
that
i
make.
the
top
case
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
yes,
let
me
enlarge
on
that,
as
and
i
think
this
is
important.
he
had
a
used
furniture
store,
naturally
he
didn't
take
the
stand
this
information
did
not
come
out.
he
had
a
used
furniture
--
but
it
did
come
out
through
the
postal
inspector.
he
had
a
furniture
store
and
he
had
people,
he
referred
to
as
dudes
and
checks
going
out
and
selling
furniture
for
him.
and
they
brought
in
the
checks.
he
opened
up
a
bank
account
and
just
as
a
businessman
would
do,
just
as
attorneys
do,
he
stamped
as
--
he
endorsed
the
checks
and
put
it
in
the
account.
now
this
in
itself
certainly
doesn't
create
knowledge
that
he
knew.
there
are
other
circumstances
that
--
in
other
words,
my
point
is
this,
the
government
doesn't
need
this
and
it's
limiting
the
constitution,
but
the
government
doesn't
need
this
instruction.
there
is
a
case
referred
to
one
of
the
cases
that
this
court
decide
about
throwing
a
baggie
of
heroine
i
think,
i
don't
know,
whether
it's
turner
or
gainey
case
but
they
throw
the
baggie
of
heroine
goes
out.
you
see
this,
this
is
circumstance,
when
you
see
that
and
the
heroine
drops
down
from
the
car
this
is
a
circumstance,
this
is
demonstrable
evidence
and
which
is
another
distinction
i
would
make
between
the
cases.
certainly
if
you
have
demonstrable
evidence,
you
would
have
more
of
a
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
nothing.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
i
was
--
i
had
to
be
trial
attorney
and
i
cross
examined
which
i
naturally
has
to
do,
cross
examine
the
--
all
we
did
is
cross
examine
and
i
think
that
is
the
valid
distinction.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
an
endorsement,
yes.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
admission.
all
he
admitted
and
we
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
speeding
up
the
trial
and
certainly
the
elements,
we
admitted
that
he
put
the
checks
in
the
account.
you
know
we
were
not
getting
around
it,
he
put
the
checks
in
the
account,
but
that
alone,
look
at
that
circumstance,
certainly
that
doesn't
create
the
criminal
situation
that
he
knew
if
i
am
at
a
party,
one
of
these
washington
cocktail
parties,
and
i
give
you
some
money
and
this
was
a
carmen
case,
and
i
say
here,
here
is
some
money
that
happens
to
be
the
stolen
money
of
the
savings
and
loan
and
as
mr.
carmen
refused
to
give
back
the
money
to
the
fbi
and
consequently
had
all
those
problems.
you
could
say,
and
i
refuse
to
take
the
stand,
as
attorney
say,
“no,
i
am
not
going
to
take
this
stand,
i
don't
have
to
take
the
stand,
they
are
constitutional
right”
then
i
could
be
subject
and
very
well
subject,
as
i
would
assume
this
man
was
a
prominent
attorney
in
texas,
to
being
convicted
and
this
was
set
aside
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
well
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
signing
of
the
checks
is
the
evidence
of
the
handwriting
analyst
said
that
these
–
this,
now
we
are
talking
on
the
counts,
i
am
separating
the
counts
of
forgery
and
possession.
the
handwriting
expert
testified
that
the
signature
was
forged
by
mr.
barnes.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
there
is
nothing
to
the
contrary,
no,
except
cross
examination
of
myself
of
the
handwriting
expert
and
we
didn't
have
at
that
time,
we
didn't
have
our
own
handwriting
expert.
but
the
possession
--
but
i
want
to
make
the
distinction
of
the
two
counts
of
possession
of
the
checks
and
distinguishing
that
between
that
and
forgery
because
i
think
these
maybe
in
different
categories,
but
my
point
is
looking
at
the
whole
picture
as
a
whole,
if
you
gentleman
feel
that
this
diminished
so
to
speak,
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
therefore
let's
give
mr.
barnes
a
whole
new
trial
on
the
element
because
as
you
mix
sugar
and
coffee
together,
it's
hard
to
separate
and
as
you
mix
and
as
you
fuse
sulphur
and
iron
filings
together
it's
impossible
to
separate,
therefore,
we
would
ask
for
a
new
trial,
and
all
the
issues
and
that
we
do
not
give
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
right,
well,
i
realize
that.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
there
were
two
checks,
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
the
let's
say
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
well,
yes.
if
he
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
right,
we
admit
if
he
signed
the
--
i
am
looking
at
this
--
clarence
smith
was
a
name
and
he
admitted,
right
he
admitted
signing
it
to
put
it
in
the
bank,
excuse
me
that
it
is
correct.
he
admitted
signing
it
to
put
this
in
the
bank,
which
is
customarily
the
banks
normally
either
stamp,
i
as
an
attorney
have
a
stamp
and
i
stamp
all
these
items
to
go
into
the
bank,
therefore
--
thereby
becoming
an
endorser
of
the
check
which
is
standard
commercial.
if
i
could
have
the
three
minutes
for
rebuttal,
thank
you.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
yes,
i
want
to
just
make
a
few
comments.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
i
have
the
exact
--
i
have
the
book
from
the
library,
here
your
honor,
excuse
me.
let
me
look
at
the
--
i
am
looking
at
volume
22,
page
3,
it
starts
at
341
and
goes
to
355.
i
checked
it
out
of
your
library.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
excuse
me.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
22,
yes
and
it
is
a
very
comprehensive
tridus
of
the
whole
thing
going
in
the
rational
connection
test
and
in
the
whole
(inaudible).
i
might
say
one
distinction,
the
rugendorf
case
which
counsel
cites,
the
defendant
did
take
the
stand
and
that
is
a
distinction
i
make.
the
leary
case
change,
it
was
affirmed
leary,
that
the
changes
started
coming
in
this
and
mcdevitt
(ph)
hasn't
been
changed,
they
are
following
the
same
instructions
without
modifications
to
the
leary
case.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
it
did,
but
as
the
roger's
case
against
it,
no
matter
what
we
call
it,
it
still
creates
a
hardship.
it
still
in
the
jury's
mind
gives
one
element
of
the
crime.
incidentally
there
was
another
jury
instruction
which
i
think
has
a
bearing,
it's
getting
to
what
the
justices
brought
out.
that
instruction
is
and
it's
a
standard
one,
that
if
from
all
the
instruction
that
from
the
all
the
instructions
inferences
or
deductions
which
have
been
established
by
the
evidence,
which
means
if
there
is
just
an
inference
and
no
testimony,
the
defendant
in
this
case
would
lose.
in
the
civil
case,
this
would
happen.
in
a
fire
case,
where
we
throw
in
this
would
happen
and
i
don't
think
we
have
that,
fortunately
we
have
the
constitution
which
is
a
probation
against
these
type
of
inferences
as
i
can
envision
many
other
type
of
inferences
that
the
government
would
like
to
use
and
this
would
stop
it.
incidentally
in
that
law
review
article,
the
case
which
is
standing
at
it
still
which
was
one
of
the
cases
--
gainey
case
and
that
was
highly
criticized
in
the
article,
but
we
can
make
a
distinction
here
an
illegal,
if
you
want
a
distinction
you
have
it
gentleman,
here
is
an
illegal
operation
still
in
somewhere
in
the
mountains
i
assume
and
here
is
a
question
of
checks,
endorsing
checks,
putting
in
a
bank
account
and
mr.
cameron,
money
that
someone
pays
him
to
represent
someone
in
a
criminal
case.
the
cameron
case
as
we
discussed
was
reversed
and
the
attorney
got
off
the
hook
in
that
case.
what
has
happened
to
it,
i
don't
really
know,
but
it
may
never
come
up
again.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
other
members
of
the
court,
i'll
try
to
keep
my
argument
relatively
brief.
most
of
my
argument,
of
course,
is
in
the
brief
submitted.
i
did
--
i
do
wish
to
point
out,
though
i
haven't
filed
a
reply
brief,
i
do
wish
to
point
out
that
i
did
discover
a
law
review
article,
stanford
law
review
article
and
i
would
like
to
mention
it
to
the
court,
volume
23,
pages,
it's
a
rather
long
article,
341
to
355,
reviews
the
and
i
just
discovered
it
in
going
through
the
argument,
hits
it
on,
i
don't
think
it
changes,
it
does
have
some
reflection,
but
i
call
it
hits
it
right
on
the
button
as
to
these
presumptions,
so
called
inferences
that
we
are
talking
about.
that
article
and
i
bring
it
up
at
this
point,
states
that
there
were
three
reasons
why
the
rational
connection
test
fails.
one
that
the
right
allows
the
prosecution
to
get
it's
case
to
the
jury
without
producing
any
evidence
of
a
prohibitive
effect
of
a
material
element
of
the
crime.
two,
that
the
presumption
of
the
evidence
is
insufficient
evidence
to
justify
a
finding
of
reasonable
doubt
and
that,
generally
flatly
this
article
states
that
rational
connection
or
not
all
of
these
presumptions
or
inferences
are
unconstitutional
as
in
giving
sort
of
a
directed
verdict
for
the
prosecution
on
the
one
element
of
the
crime.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
pure
unadulterated
constitution
fifth
amendment,
“no
person
should
be
compelled
as
a
witness”
and
we
look
at
that
little
sentence
or
segment
of
the
sentence,
we
find
that,
compelled
to
--
against
the
witness
himself,
we
find
nothing
about
a
rational
connection
test
naturally
and
going
to
the
sixth
amendment
which
says
that
“no
one
shall
be
confronted.”
they
will
be
confronted
with
witnesses
against
them
and
in
this
case,
i
think,
we
are
confronted
with
an
inference
against
them
which
says
as
in
the
barnes
case,
mr.
barnes
to
not
take
the
witness
stand
and
he
is
confronted
with
this
problem
of
getting
over
the
hurdle.
if
he
takes
the
witness
stand,
of
course,
he
puts
himself
in
pandora's
box
into
the
fire
and
then
i
don't
think
he
can
use
the
constitutional
prohibitions.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
it's
close
with
distinctions,
naturally
circumstantial
evidence,
you
don't
have
to
see
the
boy
eating
the
cookie,
if
you
see
the
broken
cookie
jar,
that's
the
old,
the
cookie
jar
analogy.
you
see
the
boy
with
a
cookie
jar
and
you
see
cookies
on
his
face,
that's
circumstantial
evidence.
but
aren't
we
doing
something
else
with
the
inferences?
aren't
we
saying
that
this
--
we're
applying
knowledge
to
it
and
that's
the
problem
that
i
see.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction.
we
have
circumstantial
evidence.
certainly
in
civil
law,
we
have
this
situation,
you
can
put
a
person
on
and
we
don't
have
any
constitutional
probation,
you
can
call
a
person
under
776
of
the
evidence
code
in
california
and
put
him
on
and
elicit
all
the
information
from.
we
have
(inaudible)
with
it
where
we
have
presumed
that
certain
elements
in
a
civil
case.
i
don't
think
that
these
elements,
we
could
say,
a
person
who
is
(inaudible)
with
one
of
these
mafia
groups.
that
his
presence
there
is
some
evidence
that
he
knows
the
conspiracy
that's
going
on.
but
i
don't
think
we
want
to
do
that.
i
don't
think
that
we
want
to
limit
the
constitution.
therefore,
i
feel
that
we
should
knock
out
these
inferences
or
as
in
the
roger's
case,
no
matter
how
piously,
and
the
court
said,
in
that
case,
no
matter
how
piously
we
state
to
the
contrary
that
these
inferences
are
in
the
jury's
mind,
that
they
could
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
no
he
did
not.
that's
a
distinction
in
counsel's
case,
they
cite
and
i
want
to
point
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
let
me
state
it
this
way
to
clear
it
out
mr.
justice.
number
one,
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
they
had
the
fbi
inspector,
the
postal
inspector
took
the
stand
and
testified
as
to
the
conversation
that
he
had
with
the
defendant
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
--
and
this
is
the
great
distinction
that
i
make.
the
top
case
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
yes,
let
me
enlarge
on
that,
as
and
i
think
this
is
important.
he
had
a
used
furniture
store,
naturally
he
didn't
take
the
stand
this
information
did
not
come
out.
he
had
a
used
furniture
--
but
it
did
come
out
through
the
postal
inspector.
he
had
a
furniture
store
and
he
had
people,
he
referred
to
as
dudes
and
checks
going
out
and
selling
furniture
for
him.
and
they
brought
in
the
checks.
he
opened
up
a
bank
account
and
just
as
a
businessman
would
do,
just
as
attorneys
do,
he
stamped
as
--
he
endorsed
the
checks
and
put
it
in
the
account.
now
this
in
itself
certainly
doesn't
create
knowledge
that
he
knew.
there
are
other
circumstances
that
--
in
other
words,
my
point
is
this,
the
government
doesn't
need
this
and
it's
limiting
the
constitution,
but
the
government
doesn't
need
this
instruction.
there
is
a
case
referred
to
one
of
the
cases
that
this
court
decide
about
throwing
a
baggie
of
heroine
i
think,
i
don't
know,
whether
it's
turner
or
gainey
case
but
they
throw
the
baggie
of
heroine
goes
out.
you
see
this,
this
is
circumstance,
when
you
see
that
and
the
heroine
drops
down
from
the
car
this
is
a
circumstance,
this
is
demonstrable
evidence
and
which
is
another
distinction
i
would
make
between
the
cases.
certainly
if
you
have
demonstrable
evidence,
you
would
have
more
of
a
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
nothing.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
i
was
--
i
had
to
be
trial
attorney
and
i
cross
examined
which
i
naturally
has
to
do,
cross
examine
the
--
all
we
did
is
cross
examine
and
i
think
that
is
the
valid
distinction.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
an
endorsement,
yes.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
admission.
all
he
admitted
and
we
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
speeding
up
the
trial
and
certainly
the
elements,
we
admitted
that
he
put
the
checks
in
the
account.
you
know
we
were
not
getting
around
it,
he
put
the
checks
in
the
account,
but
that
alone,
look
at
that
circumstance,
certainly
that
doesn't
create
the
criminal
situation
that
he
knew
if
i
am
at
a
party,
one
of
these
washington
cocktail
parties,
and
i
give
you
some
money
and
this
was
a
carmen
case,
and
i
say
here,
here
is
some
money
that
happens
to
be
the
stolen
money
of
the
savings
and
loan
and
as
mr.
carmen
refused
to
give
back
the
money
to
the
fbi
and
consequently
had
all
those
problems.
you
could
say,
and
i
refuse
to
take
the
stand,
as
attorney
say,
“no,
i
am
not
going
to
take
this
stand,
i
don't
have
to
take
the
stand,
they
are
constitutional
right”
then
i
could
be
subject
and
very
well
subject,
as
i
would
assume
this
man
was
a
prominent
attorney
in
texas,
to
being
convicted
and
this
was
set
aside
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
well
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
signing
of
the
checks
is
the
evidence
of
the
handwriting
analyst
said
that
these
–
this,
now
we
are
talking
on
the
counts,
i
am
separating
the
counts
of
forgery
and
possession.
the
handwriting
expert
testified
that
the
signature
was
forged
by
mr.
barnes.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
there
is
nothing
to
the
contrary,
no,
except
cross
examination
of
myself
of
the
handwriting
expert
and
we
didn't
have
at
that
time,
we
didn't
have
our
own
handwriting
expert.
but
the
possession
--
but
i
want
to
make
the
distinction
of
the
two
counts
of
possession
of
the
checks
and
distinguishing
that
between
that
and
forgery
because
i
think
these
maybe
in
different
categories,
but
my
point
is
looking
at
the
whole
picture
as
a
whole,
if
you
gentleman
feel
that
this
diminished
so
to
speak,
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
therefore
let's
give
mr.
barnes
a
whole
new
trial
on
the
element
because
as
you
mix
sugar
and
coffee
together,
it's
hard
to
separate
and
as
you
mix
and
as
you
fuse
sulphur
and
iron
filings
together
it's
impossible
to
separate,
therefore,
we
would
ask
for
a
new
trial,
and
all
the
issues
and
that
we
do
not
give
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
right,
well,
i
realize
that.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
there
were
two
checks,
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
the
let's
say
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
well,
yes.
if
he
--
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
right,
we
admit
if
he
signed
the
--
i
am
looking
at
this
--
clarence
smith
was
a
name
and
he
admitted,
right
he
admitted
signing
it
to
put
it
in
the
bank,
excuse
me
that
it
is
correct.
he
admitted
signing
it
to
put
this
in
the
bank,
which
is
customarily
the
banks
normally
either
stamp,
i
as
an
attorney
have
a
stamp
and
i
stamp
all
these
items
to
go
into
the
bank,
therefore
--
thereby
becoming
an
endorser
of
the
check
which
is
standard
commercial.
if
i
could
have
the
three
minutes
for
rebuttal,
thank
you.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
yes,
i
want
to
just
make
a
few
comments.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
i
have
the
exact
--
i
have
the
book
from
the
library,
here
your
honor,
excuse
me.
let
me
look
at
the
--
i
am
looking
at
volume
22,
page
3,
it
starts
at
341
and
goes
to
355.
i
checked
it
out
of
your
library.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
excuse
me.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
22,
yes
and
it
is
a
very
comprehensive
tridus
of
the
whole
thing
going
in
the
rational
connection
test
and
in
the
whole
(inaudible).
i
might
say
one
distinction,
the
rugendorf
case
which
counsel
cites,
the
defendant
did
take
the
stand
and
that
is
a
distinction
i
make.
the
leary
case
change,
it
was
affirmed
leary,
that
the
changes
started
coming
in
this
and
mcdevitt
(ph)
hasn't
been
changed,
they
are
following
the
same
instructions
without
modifications
to
the
leary
case.
mr.
malcolm
h.
mackey
it
did,
but
as
the
roger's
case
against
it,
no
matter
what
we
call
it,
it
still
creates
a
hardship.
it
still
in
the
jury's
mind
gives
one
element
of
the
crime.
incidentally
there
was
another
jury
instruction
which
i
think
has
a
bearing,
it's
getting
to
what
the
justices
brought
out.
that
instruction
is
and
it's
a
standard
one,
that
if
from
all
the
instruction
that
from
the
all
the
instructions
inferences
or
deductions
which
have
been
established
by
the
evidence,
which
means
if
there
is
just
an
inference
and
no
testimony,
the
defendant
in
this
case
would
lose.
in
the
civil
case,
this
would
happen.
in
a
fire
case,
where
we
throw
in
this
would
happen
and
i
don't
think
we
have
that,
fortunately
we
have
the
constitution
which
is
a
probation
against
these
type
of
inferences
as
i
can
envision
many
other
type
of
inferences
that
the
government
would
like
to
use
and
this
would
stop
it.
incidentally
in
that
law
review
article,
the
case
which
is
standing
at
it
still
which
was
one
of
the
cases
--
gainey
case
and
that
was
highly
criticized
in
the
article,
but
we
can
make
a
distinction
here
an
illegal,
if
you
want
a
distinction
you
have
it
gentleman,
here
is
an
illegal
operation
still
in
somewhere
in
the
mountains
i
assume
and
here
is
a
question
of
checks,
endorsing
checks,
putting
in
a
bank
account
and
mr.
cameron,
money
that
someone
pays
him
to
represent
someone
in
a
criminal
case.
the
cameron
case
as
we
discussed
was
reversed
and
the
attorney
got
off
the
hook
in
that
case.
what
has
happened
to
it,
i
don't
really
know,
but
it
may
never
come
up
again.
