mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
under
six
counts
of
an
indictment
growing
out
of
the
fact
of
two
treasury
checks
from
the
mail.
he
was
first
convicted
in
two
counts
of
unlawfully
having
possession
of
property
stolen
from
the
mail,
that
is
the
two
treasury
checks,
he
was
then
convicted
of
forging
the
two
treasury
checks
and
finally
he
was
convicted
of
uttering
the
two
treasury
checks.
as
is
true
in
most
of
cases
of
this
type
the
evidence
was
largely
circumstantial.
and
the
principle
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
judge
correctly
instructed
the
jury
that
in
determining
whether
petitioner
had
knowledge
that
this
property
was
stolen,
which
is
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offensive,
possessing
stolen
property,
whether
the
jury
probably
could
infer
from
the
fact
of
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
together
with
all
of
the
other
evidence,
that
the
petitioner
knew
the
property
was
stolen.
now
what
was
the
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
was
not
the
charge.
under
the
statute
all
that
is
required
is
that
he
know
it
is
stolen
and
that
it'd
be
stolen
from
the
mail.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
discuss
--
he
didn't
have
to
know
it
was
stolen
from
the
mail.
all
he
had
to
know
was
it
was
stolen
and
all
that
we
had
to
show
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
that
in
fact
it
was
stolen.
we
discuss
this
in
our
brief
and
we
show
that
the
legislative
history
indicates,
at
one
time
there
was
a
requirement
that
he
know
it
would
be
stolen
from
the
mails,
and
congress
deleted
the
word
of
the
statute
to
say
that
the
government
didn't
have
that
burden
of
showing
it
was
stolen
from
the
mails,
but
only
that
he
knew
it
was
stolen.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
stolen
from
the
mail,
that
is
correct.
now,
what
was
the
evidence
before
the
jury,
which
led
it
to
convict
the
petitioner.
the
starting
point
of
this
story
is
that
2nd
of
june
in
1971,
in
which
the
petitioner
whose
name
is
james
edward
barnes
opened
a
bank
account
under
the
name
of
clarence
smith.
approximately
a
month
later
on
the
1st
of
july,
it
was
stipulated
that
the
government
mailed
a
treasury
check
representing
retirement
to
a
lady
named
nettie
lewis
for
$269
and
that
two
days
later
the
government
mailed
a
similar
check
for
$286
to
a
lady
name
mary
hernandez
covering
social
security
payments.
both
of
these
ladies
testified,
they
never
received
those
checks.
five
and
seven
days
after
these
mailings
in
a
different
branch
of
the
bank,
petitioner
deposited
these
two
checks,
each
of
these
checks
had
on
it
the
endorsement
respectively
of
nettie
lewis
and
mary
hernandez,
and
also
the
name,
clarence
smith.
the
two
recipients
of
the
checks
who
never
got
them,
testified
they
didn't
know
petitioner,
they
never
authorized
petitioner
to
deposit
the
checks.
a
handwriting
expert,
who
had
taken
handwriting
exemplars
from
the
petitioner,
testified
that
upon
comparing
the
exemplars
with
the
signatures
on
the
checks,
that
petitioner
was
the
man
who
signed
all
three
names
that
is
nettie
lewis,
mary
hernandez,
and
clarence
smith.
now,
petitioners'
side
of
the
story
was
presented
through
the
testimony
of
the
postal
inspector
and
petitioner's
counsel
told
the
jury
in
his
closing
argument
that
since
the
postal
inspector
had
presented
petitioner
side
of
the
case,
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
be
called
to
the
stand.
the
testimony
he
gave
was
that
he
said
he
was
in
the
furniture
business
and
that
these
checks
have
been
presented
to
him
by
men
and
women,
who
are
going
out
selling
furniture
door-to-door.
he
was
unable
to
identify
any
of
the
people
who
allegedly
sold
the
furniture
for
him.
moreover,
he
said,
“he
had
no
records
of
any
of
these
furniture
orders”
because
he
said,
“these
orders
are
put
it
on
scraps
of
pay
book
which
they
didn't
take.”
he
admitted
that
he
signed
the
name
clarence
smith
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
which
he
had
no
record
if,
you
know,
they
just
put
it
down
on
a
little
piece
of
scrap
paper
and
he
didn't
have
any
record
of
these
furniture
sales.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
made
by,
made
by
his
agents,
yes.
he
admitted
to
the
postal
inspector
that
he
signed
the
name
clarence
smith
on
the
checks,
but
denied
that
he'd
signed
the
names
nettie
lewis
and
mary
hernandez.
the
court
gave
the
jury
a
traditional
instruction
with
respect
to
the
inferences
that
maybe
drawn
from
the
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property.
in
fact,
the
instruction
is
taken
from
a
well-known
form
book
called
devitt
and
blackmar,
federal
jury
practice
and
instructions
which
i
understand
is
currently,
widely
used
in
the
federal
courts
as
a
basis
for
jury
instructions.
but
the
court
made
clear
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
--
the
second
edition
of
this
book
was
published
in
1970.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
first
edition,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
instruction
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
jury
that
they
would
have
considered
all
the
evidence
from
this
case,
not
just
the
inference
that
maybe
drawn
from
possession,
and
that
the
--
they
would
have
drawn
no
inference
from
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand.
what
the
court
said,
and
this
is
set
forth
at
footnote
6
of
the
bottom
of
the
page
7
of
our
brief
is
that
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
if
not
satisfactorily
explained
is
ordinarily
a
circumstance
from
which
you
may,
may
reasonably
draw
the
inference
and
find
in
the
light
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
shown
by
the
evidence
in
the
case,
that
the
person
in
possession
knew
the
property
had
been
stolen.
the
court
then
immediately
charged
the
jury,
however,
you
are
never
required
to
make
this
inference,
because
he
said
it's
the
exclusive
province
of
the
jury
to
determine
whether
the
facts
and
circumstances
shown
by
the
evidence
in
this
case,
ward
any
inference
which
the
law
permits
the
jury,
not
requires,
permits
the
jury
to
draw
from
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property.
and
then,
as
saying
in
considering
whether
possession
of
recently
stolen
properties
have
been
satisfactorily
explained,
and
court
reminded
the
jury
that
the
accused
need
not
take
the
witness
stand
and
testify
and
finally
he
pointed
out,
“that
possession
maybe
satisfactorily
explained
through
other
circumstances,
other
evidence
independent
of
any
testimony
of
the
accused.”
and
of
course,
as
the
accused's
counsel
stated
to
the
jury
he
had
attempted
to
explain
his
possession
through
this
rather
incredible
statement
that
he
made
to
the
postal
inspector.
finally,
the
judge
charged
the
jury
of
two
or
three
other
things.
he
told
the
jury
that
it
was
permitted
to
draw
from
the
facts
which
you
find
have
been
proved
such
reasonable
inferences
that
you
feel
are
justified
in
the
light
of
experience.
it
gave
the
traditional
instructions
that
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
of
proving
every
essential
element
of
the
crime
charged.
and
finally
that
the
jury
was
not
to
single
out
any
single
instruction
of
stating
the
law
who
is
look
to
the
instructions
as
a
whole.
now,
this
inference
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
he
didn't
comment
on
the
explanation
as
such.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
he
did
not
generally
comment.
he
just
explained
the
law
and
stated
of
the
elements
and
told
the
jury
it
was
up
to
them
to
decide
the
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
not
brought
out
before
the
jury,
but
there
was
a
colloquy,
he
explained
that
he
had
been
on
parole
at
the
time,
and
it
was
concerned
would
if
his
true
name
came
out,
it
might
be
difficult
for
him
in
his
business
dealings,
but
that
was
not
brought
up
before
the
jury
because
of
the
possible
prejudice
of
his
being
--
that
he
was
on
parole.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
make
that
argument
as
such
because
he
did
accepted
the
instruction,
what
we
say
is
that
his
claim,
his
claim
that
as
a
result
of
this
instruction
--
that
this
instruction
constituted
in
impermissible
comment
on
his
failure
to
take
the
stand
that
that
claim
seems
to
be
belied
by
the
fact
that
he
relied
on
the
postal
inspector
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
an
explanation
and
stated
in
fact
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
take
the
stand
under
these
circumstances.
now,
this
inference
of
knowledge
from
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
is
one
of
the
oldest
known
to
law.
it
goes
far
back
into
the
history
of
the
common
law.
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
consistently
improved
the
instruction,
i
think
the
only
exception
that
i
know
is
the
fifth
circuit
case
decision
in
cameron
upon
which
petitioner
largely
relies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice
as
recently
as
1946
--
i
am
sorry
1964
in
the
rugendorf
case
which
involve
the
possession
of
stolen
purse.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice
it's
much
more
than
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
probably
would
have
been
enough,
but
the
court
didn't
so
limit
these.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
do
like
that
argument,
but
our
position
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
think
the
instruction
is
proper.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that
was
the
only
evidence
in
the
case,
the
jury
may
infer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
would
be
valid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
lack
of
any
explanation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
we
think
would
be
enough
mr.
justice.
but
as
i
say
in
this
case
there
was
a
great
deal
more
than.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
only
because
mr.
justice
and
i
assume
the
reason
the
court
took
the
cases
of
the
conflicting
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
cameron
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
that
particular
decision
has
--
i
don't
believe
is
pending
because
that
case
has
been
reversed
and
was
retried
i
understand.
there
maybe
a
further,
there
may
be
a
petition
pending
growing
out
of
his
second
conviction,
but
i
am
not
certain.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
instruction
that
the
court
of
appeals
struck
down
in
the
cameron
cases,
almost
a
carbon
copy
to
the
instruction
which
the
ninth
circuit
here
approved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
so
as
it
was
decided,
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
did,
it
did.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might
mr.
justice,
expect
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
cameron
decision
did
not
go
on
that
basis.
what
the
firth
circuit
said
in
the
cameron
case
was
that
the
inference
cannot
be
drawn
where
the
element
of
knowledge
is
itself
a
separate
element
of
the
offense.
the
fifth
circuit
in
cameron
said,
“ordinarily,
the
instruction
from
unexplained
possession
is
a
permissible
one,”
but
it
said,
“you
can't
draw
that
inference,
where
the
fact
of
knowledge
is
a
separate
element
of
the
offense'
and
it
said,
“since
the
charge
there
involved
proof,
both
of
possession
have
recently
stolen
property
and
knowledge
that
it
was
stolen,
you
couldn't
infer
from
the
fact
that
possession
of
the
fact
of
knowledge.”
now
i
assume
that
what
the
court
really
was
saying
in
that
case
was
that
since
congress
has
specified
two
elements
of
the
offense,
the
government
couldn't
prove
the
two
elements
by
merely
proving
the
one,
i
assume
this,
is
what
the
legal
rational,
it's
not
clear
in
the
opinion.
well,
i
answer
to
that
is
two-fold.
first,
we
think
as
a
matter
of
analysis
it's
unsound
because
it's
not
the
same
offense.
it's
not
the
same
evidence.
possession
is
proven
merely
by
showing
possession
of
stolen
property.
the
inference
maybe
drawn
only
if
it's
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
that
is
not
satisfactorily
explained,
but
more
basic
than
that
we
don't
think
there
is
any
justification
for
drawing
this
distinction,
the
reason
this
inference
from
possession
of
--
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
has
been
upheld,
since
time
immemorial
is
because
that
comports
with
normal
experience.
if
a
person
ordinarily
has
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
it
seems
that
just
common
sense
that
the
chances
are
great,
that
he
is
either
the
thief
who
at
least
knows
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
it's
more
likely
to
not
stand
it
and
we
certainly
do
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
from
leary,
i
believe,
but
we
think
whatever
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
more
rational
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
more
likely
--
the
standard
we
don't
accept,
the
standard
we
don't
think
is
a
sound
standard
is
the
question
this
court
has
left
open
that
it
has
--
you
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
inferred
fact
flows
from
the
proven
fact.
we
don't
think
that
standard
is
appropriate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
could
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
except,
mr.
justice
for
the
fact
that
the
instruction
was
qualified
by
the
words
”in
the
light
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
shown
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
the
naked
inference
itself,
we
don't
think
it's
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that's
correct
and
i
am
perfectly
happy
to
defend
that,
but
it
seems
to
me,
we
don't
have
to
defend
it
on
this
instruction.
i
assume
the
reason
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
mr.
justice
we
opposed
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do,
we
usually
do,
but
we
suggested
in
this
case
--er
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think,
it
would
be
appropriate
mr.
justice.
the
thing
that
bothers
us
of
course
is
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
cameron.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yeah
the
jury
could
have
mr.
have
mr.
justice
but
there
jury
was
instructed,
it
had
to
find
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
every
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
all
it
had
to
believe,
but
i
think
we
must
assume
however
that
the
jury
did
follow
the
court's
instruction,
that
is,
looking
to
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
could
have,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
mr.
justice
that
in
deciding
to
draw
the
inference
and
the
court
stressed
that
the
jury
was
not
required
to
draw
the
inference,
but
it
was
within
it's
discretion.
i
think
in
deciding
to
draw
the
inference
one
must
assume
that
the
jury
looked
at
all
the
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we
don't
know.
we
don't
suggest
that,
we
think
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
we
think
this
is
a
very
strong
case
on
the
fact.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
of
that
and
we
think
that
this
instruction
here,
leaves
it
to
the
jury
fully
to
consider
all
the
facts
in
the
case
to
draw
whatever
inferences
are
appropriate
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts
and
to
just
determine
on
all
the
facts,
on
the
circumstantial
evidence
as
a
jury
ordinarily
does
in
deciding,
for
instance,
of
circumstantial
evidence
whether
the
government
had
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
petitioner
has
knowledge
that
checks
were
stolen
and
we
submit
that
on
this
record
the
jury
was
fully
justified
in
drawing
that
inference.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice.
it's
most
unfortunate
but
there
seemed
to
be
an
enormous
number
of
prosecutions
involving
possession
of
stolen
property,
theft
from
the
mails
is
constantly
a
serious
problem.
this
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
causing
problems.
conceivably
another
circuit
might
follow,
i
assume
at
least
within
the
fifth
circuit
it
would
be
very
difficult.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
thought
i
have
made
that
clear
mr.
justice,
there
is
conflict
in
that,
the
fifth
circuit
found
inadequate
and
improper
virtually
the
identical
instruction
to
that
which
the
judge
gave
in
this
case
and
which
the
ninth
circuit
proved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
large
--
i
don't
know
the
exact
--
i
wouldn't
be
at
all
surprised
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
under
six
counts
of
an
indictment
growing
out
of
the
fact
of
two
treasury
checks
from
the
mail.
he
was
first
convicted
in
two
counts
of
unlawfully
having
possession
of
property
stolen
from
the
mail,
that
is
the
two
treasury
checks,
he
was
then
convicted
of
forging
the
two
treasury
checks
and
finally
he
was
convicted
of
uttering
the
two
treasury
checks.
as
is
true
in
most
of
cases
of
this
type
the
evidence
was
largely
circumstantial.
and
the
principle
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
judge
correctly
instructed
the
jury
that
in
determining
whether
petitioner
had
knowledge
that
this
property
was
stolen,
which
is
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offensive,
possessing
stolen
property,
whether
the
jury
probably
could
infer
from
the
fact
of
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
together
with
all
of
the
other
evidence,
that
the
petitioner
knew
the
property
was
stolen.
now
what
was
the
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
was
not
the
charge.
under
the
statute
all
that
is
required
is
that
he
know
it
is
stolen
and
that
it'd
be
stolen
from
the
mail.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
discuss
--
he
didn't
have
to
know
it
was
stolen
from
the
mail.
all
he
had
to
know
was
it
was
stolen
and
all
that
we
had
to
show
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
that
in
fact
it
was
stolen.
we
discuss
this
in
our
brief
and
we
show
that
the
legislative
history
indicates,
at
one
time
there
was
a
requirement
that
he
know
it
would
be
stolen
from
the
mails,
and
congress
deleted
the
word
of
the
statute
to
say
that
the
government
didn't
have
that
burden
of
showing
it
was
stolen
from
the
mails,
but
only
that
he
knew
it
was
stolen.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
stolen
from
the
mail,
that
is
correct.
now,
what
was
the
evidence
before
the
jury,
which
led
it
to
convict
the
petitioner.
the
starting
point
of
this
story
is
that
2nd
of
june
in
1971,
in
which
the
petitioner
whose
name
is
james
edward
barnes
opened
a
bank
account
under
the
name
of
clarence
smith.
approximately
a
month
later
on
the
1st
of
july,
it
was
stipulated
that
the
government
mailed
a
treasury
check
representing
retirement
to
a
lady
named
nettie
lewis
for
$269
and
that
two
days
later
the
government
mailed
a
similar
check
for
$286
to
a
lady
name
mary
hernandez
covering
social
security
payments.
both
of
these
ladies
testified,
they
never
received
those
checks.
five
and
seven
days
after
these
mailings
in
a
different
branch
of
the
bank,
petitioner
deposited
these
two
checks,
each
of
these
checks
had
on
it
the
endorsement
respectively
of
nettie
lewis
and
mary
hernandez,
and
also
the
name,
clarence
smith.
the
two
recipients
of
the
checks
who
never
got
them,
testified
they
didn't
know
petitioner,
they
never
authorized
petitioner
to
deposit
the
checks.
a
handwriting
expert,
who
had
taken
handwriting
exemplars
from
the
petitioner,
testified
that
upon
comparing
the
exemplars
with
the
signatures
on
the
checks,
that
petitioner
was
the
man
who
signed
all
three
names
that
is
nettie
lewis,
mary
hernandez,
and
clarence
smith.
now,
petitioners'
side
of
the
story
was
presented
through
the
testimony
of
the
postal
inspector
and
petitioner's
counsel
told
the
jury
in
his
closing
argument
that
since
the
postal
inspector
had
presented
petitioner
side
of
the
case,
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
be
called
to
the
stand.
the
testimony
he
gave
was
that
he
said
he
was
in
the
furniture
business
and
that
these
checks
have
been
presented
to
him
by
men
and
women,
who
are
going
out
selling
furniture
door-to-door.
he
was
unable
to
identify
any
of
the
people
who
allegedly
sold
the
furniture
for
him.
moreover,
he
said,
“he
had
no
records
of
any
of
these
furniture
orders”
because
he
said,
“these
orders
are
put
it
on
scraps
of
pay
book
which
they
didn't
take.”
he
admitted
that
he
signed
the
name
clarence
smith
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
which
he
had
no
record
if,
you
know,
they
just
put
it
down
on
a
little
piece
of
scrap
paper
and
he
didn't
have
any
record
of
these
furniture
sales.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
made
by,
made
by
his
agents,
yes.
he
admitted
to
the
postal
inspector
that
he
signed
the
name
clarence
smith
on
the
checks,
but
denied
that
he'd
signed
the
names
nettie
lewis
and
mary
hernandez.
the
court
gave
the
jury
a
traditional
instruction
with
respect
to
the
inferences
that
maybe
drawn
from
the
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property.
in
fact,
the
instruction
is
taken
from
a
well-known
form
book
called
devitt
and
blackmar,
federal
jury
practice
and
instructions
which
i
understand
is
currently,
widely
used
in
the
federal
courts
as
a
basis
for
jury
instructions.
but
the
court
made
clear
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
--
the
second
edition
of
this
book
was
published
in
1970.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
first
edition,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
instruction
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
jury
that
they
would
have
considered
all
the
evidence
from
this
case,
not
just
the
inference
that
maybe
drawn
from
possession,
and
that
the
--
they
would
have
drawn
no
inference
from
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand.
what
the
court
said,
and
this
is
set
forth
at
footnote
6
of
the
bottom
of
the
page
7
of
our
brief
is
that
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
if
not
satisfactorily
explained
is
ordinarily
a
circumstance
from
which
you
may,
may
reasonably
draw
the
inference
and
find
in
the
light
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
shown
by
the
evidence
in
the
case,
that
the
person
in
possession
knew
the
property
had
been
stolen.
the
court
then
immediately
charged
the
jury,
however,
you
are
never
required
to
make
this
inference,
because
he
said
it's
the
exclusive
province
of
the
jury
to
determine
whether
the
facts
and
circumstances
shown
by
the
evidence
in
this
case,
ward
any
inference
which
the
law
permits
the
jury,
not
requires,
permits
the
jury
to
draw
from
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property.
and
then,
as
saying
in
considering
whether
possession
of
recently
stolen
properties
have
been
satisfactorily
explained,
and
court
reminded
the
jury
that
the
accused
need
not
take
the
witness
stand
and
testify
and
finally
he
pointed
out,
“that
possession
maybe
satisfactorily
explained
through
other
circumstances,
other
evidence
independent
of
any
testimony
of
the
accused.”
and
of
course,
as
the
accused's
counsel
stated
to
the
jury
he
had
attempted
to
explain
his
possession
through
this
rather
incredible
statement
that
he
made
to
the
postal
inspector.
finally,
the
judge
charged
the
jury
of
two
or
three
other
things.
he
told
the
jury
that
it
was
permitted
to
draw
from
the
facts
which
you
find
have
been
proved
such
reasonable
inferences
that
you
feel
are
justified
in
the
light
of
experience.
it
gave
the
traditional
instructions
that
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
of
proving
every
essential
element
of
the
crime
charged.
and
finally
that
the
jury
was
not
to
single
out
any
single
instruction
of
stating
the
law
who
is
look
to
the
instructions
as
a
whole.
now,
this
inference
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
he
didn't
comment
on
the
explanation
as
such.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
he
did
not
generally
comment.
he
just
explained
the
law
and
stated
of
the
elements
and
told
the
jury
it
was
up
to
them
to
decide
the
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
not
brought
out
before
the
jury,
but
there
was
a
colloquy,
he
explained
that
he
had
been
on
parole
at
the
time,
and
it
was
concerned
would
if
his
true
name
came
out,
it
might
be
difficult
for
him
in
his
business
dealings,
but
that
was
not
brought
up
before
the
jury
because
of
the
possible
prejudice
of
his
being
--
that
he
was
on
parole.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
make
that
argument
as
such
because
he
did
accepted
the
instruction,
what
we
say
is
that
his
claim,
his
claim
that
as
a
result
of
this
instruction
--
that
this
instruction
constituted
in
impermissible
comment
on
his
failure
to
take
the
stand
that
that
claim
seems
to
be
belied
by
the
fact
that
he
relied
on
the
postal
inspector
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
an
explanation
and
stated
in
fact
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
take
the
stand
under
these
circumstances.
now,
this
inference
of
knowledge
from
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
is
one
of
the
oldest
known
to
law.
it
goes
far
back
into
the
history
of
the
common
law.
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
consistently
improved
the
instruction,
i
think
the
only
exception
that
i
know
is
the
fifth
circuit
case
decision
in
cameron
upon
which
petitioner
largely
relies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice
as
recently
as
1946
--
i
am
sorry
1964
in
the
rugendorf
case
which
involve
the
possession
of
stolen
purse.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice
it's
much
more
than
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
probably
would
have
been
enough,
but
the
court
didn't
so
limit
these.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
do
like
that
argument,
but
our
position
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
think
the
instruction
is
proper.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that
was
the
only
evidence
in
the
case,
the
jury
may
infer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
would
be
valid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
lack
of
any
explanation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
we
think
would
be
enough
mr.
justice.
but
as
i
say
in
this
case
there
was
a
great
deal
more
than.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
only
because
mr.
justice
and
i
assume
the
reason
the
court
took
the
cases
of
the
conflicting
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
cameron
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
that
particular
decision
has
--
i
don't
believe
is
pending
because
that
case
has
been
reversed
and
was
retried
i
understand.
there
maybe
a
further,
there
may
be
a
petition
pending
growing
out
of
his
second
conviction,
but
i
am
not
certain.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
instruction
that
the
court
of
appeals
struck
down
in
the
cameron
cases,
almost
a
carbon
copy
to
the
instruction
which
the
ninth
circuit
here
approved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
so
as
it
was
decided,
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
did,
it
did.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might
mr.
justice,
expect
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
cameron
decision
did
not
go
on
that
basis.
what
the
firth
circuit
said
in
the
cameron
case
was
that
the
inference
cannot
be
drawn
where
the
element
of
knowledge
is
itself
a
separate
element
of
the
offense.
the
fifth
circuit
in
cameron
said,
“ordinarily,
the
instruction
from
unexplained
possession
is
a
permissible
one,”
but
it
said,
“you
can't
draw
that
inference,
where
the
fact
of
knowledge
is
a
separate
element
of
the
offense'
and
it
said,
“since
the
charge
there
involved
proof,
both
of
possession
have
recently
stolen
property
and
knowledge
that
it
was
stolen,
you
couldn't
infer
from
the
fact
that
possession
of
the
fact
of
knowledge.”
now
i
assume
that
what
the
court
really
was
saying
in
that
case
was
that
since
congress
has
specified
two
elements
of
the
offense,
the
government
couldn't
prove
the
two
elements
by
merely
proving
the
one,
i
assume
this,
is
what
the
legal
rational,
it's
not
clear
in
the
opinion.
well,
i
answer
to
that
is
two-fold.
first,
we
think
as
a
matter
of
analysis
it's
unsound
because
it's
not
the
same
offense.
it's
not
the
same
evidence.
possession
is
proven
merely
by
showing
possession
of
stolen
property.
the
inference
maybe
drawn
only
if
it's
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
that
is
not
satisfactorily
explained,
but
more
basic
than
that
we
don't
think
there
is
any
justification
for
drawing
this
distinction,
the
reason
this
inference
from
possession
of
--
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
has
been
upheld,
since
time
immemorial
is
because
that
comports
with
normal
experience.
if
a
person
ordinarily
has
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
it
seems
that
just
common
sense
that
the
chances
are
great,
that
he
is
either
the
thief
who
at
least
knows
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
it's
more
likely
to
not
stand
it
and
we
certainly
do
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
from
leary,
i
believe,
but
we
think
whatever
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
more
rational
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
more
likely
--
the
standard
we
don't
accept,
the
standard
we
don't
think
is
a
sound
standard
is
the
question
this
court
has
left
open
that
it
has
--
you
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
inferred
fact
flows
from
the
proven
fact.
we
don't
think
that
standard
is
appropriate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
could
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
except,
mr.
justice
for
the
fact
that
the
instruction
was
qualified
by
the
words
”in
the
light
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
shown
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
the
naked
inference
itself,
we
don't
think
it's
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that's
correct
and
i
am
perfectly
happy
to
defend
that,
but
it
seems
to
me,
we
don't
have
to
defend
it
on
this
instruction.
i
assume
the
reason
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
mr.
justice
we
opposed
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do,
we
usually
do,
but
we
suggested
in
this
case
--er
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think,
it
would
be
appropriate
mr.
justice.
the
thing
that
bothers
us
of
course
is
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
cameron.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yeah
the
jury
could
have
mr.
have
mr.
justice
but
there
jury
was
instructed,
it
had
to
find
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
every
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
all
it
had
to
believe,
but
i
think
we
must
assume
however
that
the
jury
did
follow
the
court's
instruction,
that
is,
looking
to
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
could
have,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
mr.
justice
that
in
deciding
to
draw
the
inference
and
the
court
stressed
that
the
jury
was
not
required
to
draw
the
inference,
but
it
was
within
it's
discretion.
i
think
in
deciding
to
draw
the
inference
one
must
assume
that
the
jury
looked
at
all
the
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we
don't
know.
we
don't
suggest
that,
we
think
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
we
think
this
is
a
very
strong
case
on
the
fact.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
of
that
and
we
think
that
this
instruction
here,
leaves
it
to
the
jury
fully
to
consider
all
the
facts
in
the
case
to
draw
whatever
inferences
are
appropriate
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts
and
to
just
determine
on
all
the
facts,
on
the
circumstantial
evidence
as
a
jury
ordinarily
does
in
deciding,
for
instance,
of
circumstantial
evidence
whether
the
government
had
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
petitioner
has
knowledge
that
checks
were
stolen
and
we
submit
that
on
this
record
the
jury
was
fully
justified
in
drawing
that
inference.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice.
it's
most
unfortunate
but
there
seemed
to
be
an
enormous
number
of
prosecutions
involving
possession
of
stolen
property,
theft
from
the
mails
is
constantly
a
serious
problem.
this
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
causing
problems.
conceivably
another
circuit
might
follow,
i
assume
at
least
within
the
fifth
circuit
it
would
be
very
difficult.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
thought
i
have
made
that
clear
mr.
justice,
there
is
conflict
in
that,
the
fifth
circuit
found
inadequate
and
improper
virtually
the
identical
instruction
to
that
which
the
judge
gave
in
this
case
and
which
the
ninth
circuit
proved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
large
--
i
don't
know
the
exact
--
i
wouldn't
be
at
all
surprised
mr.
chief
justice.
