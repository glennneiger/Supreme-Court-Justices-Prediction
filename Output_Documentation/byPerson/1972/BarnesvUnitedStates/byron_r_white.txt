justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
than
we
should
look
to
this
case
as
though
the
government
had
only
put
into
the
evidence
of
the
fact
that
possession
plus
fact
that
goods
were
recently
stolen
and
have
been
stolen
from
mail.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
–
wouldn't
that
had
been
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
you
are
saying
then
that
the
--
that
the
instructions
here
is
--
even
if
there
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
then,
you
would
make
the
same
argument,
if
the
only
evidence
there
was
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
the
instruction
nevertheless
would
be
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
conviction
would
be
valid,
if
your
only
evidence
was
possession,
proof
of
brief
and
that
is
was
from
mail?
justice
byron
r.
white
record
is
otherwise
is
silent?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
standard
is,
mr.
friedman?
is
it
no
rational
connection,
a
tort
type
thing
or
is
it
more
likely
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
from
leary?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
willing
to
accept
that
standard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
prejudice?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
more
likely
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
to
get
to
my
example
that
i
gave
a
while
ago,
simply
goes
the
instruction
actually
was
given,
and
the
jury
was
--
would
have
been
permitted
to
disbelieve
every
--
all
the
other
evidence
except
those
basic
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
don't
know
what
the
jury
--
the
jury
might
have
been
relied
on
just
those
basic
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
you
just
the
say
the
question
just
isn't
really
here
as
to
the
validity
of
these
–
it's
just
interference?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
that
that
effects
you
with
the
--
that
--
those
words
in
that
instruction
really
save
it
in
a
sense
that
the
jury
still
could
have
disbelieved
everything
except
the
fact
of
possession?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
possession,
of
the
fact
that
it
was
recently
stolen
and
the
fact
it
was
recently
stolen
from
the
mail,
that's
all
it
had
to
really
believe?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
didn't
have
to
believe
it.
all
it
really
had
to
do
was
to
–
it
could
have
disbelieved
all
the
other
evidence,
but
still
relied
on
the
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
that
tihs
case
suggested
that
the
prosecutor
and
the
prosecution
suggested
to
the
judge
that
at
least
that
prosecution
shouldn't
submit.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
wouldn't
like
the
abandoned
instructions
and
facts
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
say
that
this
case
that
we
had
before
us,
really
isn't
unique,
that
there
really
isn't
conflict
of
this
sort?
