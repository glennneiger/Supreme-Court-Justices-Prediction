mr.
raymond
randolph
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
about
pending
legislation.
that
is
pointed
out
on
the
page
6
of
the
government's
brief
in
footnote
8.
what
happened
to
the
legislation
was
that
it
passed
senate,
the
legislation
essentially
enacted
into
the
--
as
an
amendment
to
the
act
of
four
installment
rule,
that's
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
legislation
did
pass
the
senate,
but
it
was
not
reported
out
of
the
house
banking
and
currency
committee
in
time
before
congress
adjourned.
this
legislation
has
essentially
died
for
this
term.
the
other
question,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
at
the
beginning,
mr.
chief
justice
burger's
question
with
regard
to
evidence
in
the
case
as
to
what
publisher's
charge
for
these
magazines
subscription
would
have
been.
i
take
it
that
question
is
directed
to
determining
whether
in
fact
there
is
varied
finance
charged
in
this
transaction.
the
proper
comparison
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
submit,
would
be
not
what
the
publishers
charge,
but
what
family
publications
would
have
charged
a
cash
customer,
a
person
that
was
willing
to
pay
the
entire
amount
online
when
they
contracted
for
the
magazines
as
opposed
to
what
they
charged
someone
who
would
defer
the
payment
over
a
longer
period
of
time
such
as
mrs.
mourning.
mr.
raymond
randolph
that
might
be,
but
i
think
that
if
the
--
if
you
can
show
--
if
one
could
show
that
the
a
cash
customer
pays
less
than
a
time
customer,
there
is
direct
legislative
history
to
show
that's
considered
just
simply
another
way
of
saying
we
are
charging
you
for
something
more
for
paying
overtime
which
essentially
is
a
finance
charge.
in
the
district
court,
an
affidavit
was
submitted
by
the
vice
president
of
family
publications
services.
that
affidavit
read
as
follows.
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
it
said,
there
is
no
discount
for
paying
at
once
and
no
charge
for
paying
over
24
or
30
months.
however,
now
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
but
that's
what
that
affidavit
would
lead
one
to
believe.
however,
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
we
find
on
page
3
of
family
publications
service's
brief
in
the
second
footnote,
the
admission
that
contrary
to
representations
made
below,
cash
customers
do
in
fact
get
a
discount.
statement
is
made
that
cash
customers
only
represent
1%
of
family
publication's
total
customers,
but
that's
not
the
relevant
figure.
i
have
inquired
as
to
what
exactly,
how
much
this
discount
is
and
apparently
that's
not
known.
i
have
inquired
as
to
exactly
what
percentage
of
cash
customers
get
a
discount
and
that's
not
known.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes,
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
raymond
randolph
i
think
it
would.
i
think
i
can
bring
to
light
how
that
does
bear
on
the
issue.
mr.
raymond
randolph
i
think
it
confirms
congress's
judgment
and
board's
judgment
that
whenever
a
credit
is
extended
for
any
appreciable
length
of
time
that
costs
are
incurred
by
the
creditor.
as
an
economic
fact,
he
must
incur
cost
and
those
costs
are
contains
as
some
components
of
selling
price
regardless
of
whether
he
differentiates
it
out
for
the
consumer
or
not.
mr.
raymond
randolph
this
regulation
applies
regardless
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
i
would
maintain
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
that's
right.
but
what
i
am
about
to
appose
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
theoretically
a
transaction
without
a
finance
charge
is
some
component
of
selling
price
as
possible.
practically,
it
would
not
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
no.
mr.
raymond
randolph
that's
right,
because
we
first
of
all
say
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
define
creditors,
those
who
regularly
extend
finance
charges.
now
they
are
people
that
have
to
disclose
under
the
act.
there
will
be
no
problem
at
all
in
applying
this
provision
if
every
creditor
simply
said,
my
finance
charge
is
this,
my
selling
price
is
this.
no
difficultly.
but
there
are
some
creditors
that
have
never,
perhaps
never
differentiated
the
cost
of
credit
from
the
selling
price
of
the
goods.
apparent
reason
being
that
they
sold
primarily
all
their
goods
on
credit
and
there
would
be
no
reason
for
them
without
a
disclosure
requirement
for
it
to
differentiate.
they
would
say
my
price
is
$120
payable
in
10
monthly
installments
for
one
year
or
10
monthly
installments
over
a
period
of
time.
that
will
be
all
they
tell
the
consumer.
the
question
is
what
is
going
to
be
done
about
those
transactions?
well,
the
assumption
throughout
the
congressional
hearings,
and
seven
years
of
congressional
hearings
is
that
whenever
a
creditor
said
or
a
retailer
said
there
is
no
charge
for
credit,
that
simply
meant
that
somewhere
in
that
selling
price,
a
component
of
that
selling
price
was
the
cost
of
credit
to
the
retailer.
now
this
assumption
is
based
on
a
very
simple
economic
fact.
whenever
the
seller
extends
credit
for
any
appreciable
length
of
time
incurs
cost.
now
we
maintain
that
this
case
is
no
exception.
fps
sent
letters
to
mrs.
mourning
and
that
cost
the
money
that
they
would
not
have
had
to
incur
if
they
operated
on
a
cash
business.
they
took
legal
action
against
those
who
defaulted
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
page
19
of
the
appendix,
fps
tells
mrs.
mourning,
they
don't
want
to
do
that
to
her
because
it's
very
expensive.
that's
another
cost
that
they
would
not
have
incurred
if
they
operated
on
a
cash
basis.
they
ran
collection
offices
in
florida
for
people
who
were
late
in
their
payments.
this
is
revealed
on
page
25
and
27
of
the
appendix,
and
fps
itself
told
mrs.
mourning
that
had
paid
for
this
merchandise
before
it
received
payment
for
mrs.
mourning.
we
don't
know
whether
fps
ran
credit
checks
or
had
a
bad
debt
reserve
or
anything
of
that
sort,
whether
it
had
to
borrow
money
to
pay
for
these
magazine
subscriptions,
but
we
do
know
that
every
transaction
for
any
appreciable
length
of
time,
the
cost
of
creditor
is
going
to
be
incurred.
that
would
not
be
incurred
if
they
ran
a
cash
business.
the
problem
that
faced
the
federal
reserve
board
is
what
they
do
about
this,
because
their
solution
is
the
four
installment
rule.
now
before
the
ink
was
even
dry
on
this
bill,
the
federal
reserve
board
began
the
task
of
setting
the
act
in
motion.
as
my
co-counsel
has
explained,
the
federal
reserve
board
was
involved
in
this
legislation
from
the
very
beginning,
it
testified
many
times
before
congress
and
took
an
active
part
in
consideration
of
the
legislation.
congress
in
fact
delayed
the
effective
date
of
the
act
for
one
year
in
order
to
allow
the
board
time
to
set
up
regulation
to
implement
it
or
in
the
words
of
the
house
report
on
page
19,
this
formulation
such
“substantive“
regulation
so
necessary
for
effective
enforcement
of
the
act”.
what
did
the
board
do?
the
first
thing
it
did
was
it
set
up
a
task
force
drawn
from
the
staffs
of
various
federal
reserve
banks
around
the
country
and
from
its
own
staff.
it
drew
upon
retail
credit
experts
to
look
at
these
problems.
it
drew
upon
vice
presidents
of
various
federal
reserve
banks,
the
actuary,
the
treasury
was
drawn
in.
it
set
up
an
advisory
panel
of
20
members
representing
retailer
and
lender
and
consumer
groups
from
every
section
of
the
country
and
headed
by
the
dean
of
the
berkley
school
of
business
and
after
they
studied
this
problem,
as
i
said
their
solution
was
the
four
installment
rule,
but
the
board
didn't
stop
there.
on
page
19
of
our
brief
in
footnote
22,
there
is
an
explanation
of
what
the
four
installment
rule
is
all
about
and
why
the
board
did
it.
this
is
testimony
from
vice
chairman
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
robinson,
it's
before
the
regulations
took
effect
and
he
is
testifying
before
the
very
committee
of
congress
that
enacted
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
explaining
exactly
what
the
board
did
before
the
regulations
take
effect.
in
that
testimony,
what
i
have
just
described
is
as
far
as
the
promulgating
process
is
concerned,
is
confirmed.
the
other
thing
that
board
did
was
undertake
a
massive
campaign
to
inform
creditors
of
exactly
what
there
obligations
would
be
and
what
the
board
called
z
day
which
is
when
regulation
z
took
effect
in
july
of
1969.
it
distributed
a
million
and
half
of
these
pamphlets
which
describe
in
detail
exactly
every
creditor's
obligations
and
they
were
distributed
to
every
known
person
or
firm
extending
consumer
credit
in
the
country.
the
board
also
ran
seminars
in
the
federal
reserve
bank
and
the
other
informational
services.
mr.
raymond
randolph
let
me
go
in
down
what
--
let's
the
usual
case
and
this
is
one
where
there
is
no
finance
charge
differentiated
from
the
cost.
in
four
installment
rule
is
what,
they
would
have
had
to
say
the
down
payment.
now
the
fps
contract
that
is
set
out
on
pages
6-7
of
the
appendix,
it
will
be
helpful
to
follow
that.
they
did
that.
they
said,
pay
only
$3.95
down.
the
next
thing
they
would
have
had
to
do
is
give
the
number,
amount
and
due
dates
of
the
payments.
now
we
think
they
substantially
complied
with
that,
they
said,
395
each
month
for
30
months.
of
course,
if
the
truth
in
lending
act
doesn't
apply,
the
next
contract
fps
rights
could
say
395
a
month
for
two-and-half
years.
there
will
be
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that
but
they
did
that
in
this
case.
the
next
thing
they
would
have
had
to
tell
mrs.
mourning
is
the
total
of
payments.
they
did
not
disclose
this
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
no
the
30
times
395.
mr.
raymond
randolph
but
payments
she
would
have
to
make
after
the
salesman
walked
out
the
door.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes
it's
interesting
i
think
mr.
justice
that
on
page
17
is
the
first
time,
the
family
publications
did
that
modification
for
mrs.
mourning,
you
will
notice
they
say
the
time
is
here
now,
we
cannot
wait
any
longer
for
your
payment.
we
give
you
48
hours
to
forward
the
entire
balance
of
a
$118.50.
they
had
the
courtesy
to
mollify
it
for
their.
the
next
thing
is
the
cash
prize.
now
this
is
interesting,
fps
never
disclosed.
so
there
is
no
indication
of
what
their
cash
prize
is
here
but
now
we
know
as
i
stated
early
in
my
argument
that
there
was
a
cash
prize
but
we
don't
know
how
much
it
was
and
neither
did
mrs.
mourning.
mr.
raymond
randolph
it
was
lowered
we
know
that.
i
think
that
i
might
digress
you
for
a
moment.
this
is
one
of
the
main
points
of
the
four
installment
rule
2
in
addition
to
preventing
certain
invention
and
evasion.
it
gives
creditors
an
easy
rule
to
follow
and
no
charge
for
credit
transactions.
they
know
that
they
don't
have
to
away
the
consumer's
action
against
them
to
prove
exactly
and
calculate
what
their
finance
charge
was,
if
the
consumer
could
ever
prove
that.
but
it
gives
them
a
clear
rule
to
follow
and
maybe
the
fps
never
thought
they
charged
the
finance
charge.
i
remember
doing
the
hearings
that
sears
and
roebucks
company
came
in
before
senator
douglas
who
was
the
principal
sponsor
claiming,
we
charge
no
finance
charges.
it
took
senator
douglas
five
pages
of
testimony
in
a
computer
to
prove
to
them
then
they
in
fact
did.
after
which
they
admitted
it.
so
it's
not
all
purposeful
evasion,
it's
misunderstanding
too.
okay,
so
we
don't
know
the
finding.
the
next
thing
is
the
amount
financed
which
would
be
the
cash
prize
minus
the
down-payment,
of
course
we
don't
know
this
either
because
we
don't
know
what
in
fact
the
cash
prize
is
now.
and
then
final
thing
will
be
the
differed
payment
prize
which
will
be
everything.
finance
charge,
the
cash
prize,
the
down-payment
and
all
additional
charges.
in
this
case
we
come
to
a
$122.45.
none
of
this
was
told
to
mrs.
mourning.
we
throughout
this
litigation
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
randolph
well,
i
think
that
one
of
the
major
points,
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
is
that
if
you
were
a
mathematician,
you
might
be
able
to
get
all
the
information
by
taking
certain
figures
and
juggling
around
that
a
creditor
is
required
to
disclosed
under
the
act.
two
things,
everyone
is
not
a
mathematician
and
second
in
the
pressure
of
a
sale,
when
the
seller
is
emphasizing
the
merchandise,
the
amount
of
money,
you
can
afford
this.
people
may
not
be
able
to
conduct
themselves
so
that
they
would
sit
down
with
a
pencil
and
realize
their
obligations.
throughout
this
litigation,
i
think
it's
interesting
that
fps
has
never
said
why
don't
they
want
to
tell
their
customers
this?
it's
not
going
to
cost
them
very
much
money;
this
is
a
standard
form
of
contract.
they
could
run
them
off
by
the
thousands
at
very
little
expense
but
putting
in
a
few
more
lines,
describing
what
i
said,
it
maybe
that
they
don't
want
their
salesmen
to
go
to
people
and
say
how
do
you
like
to
buy
some
magazines
for
a
$122.45
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
that's
exactly
right
mr.
justice
–-
mr.
raymond
randolph
they
give
them
information
and
if
they
want
to
make
mistakes
at
least,
they
will
have
the
information
before
them.
mr.
raymond
randolph
sorry,
i
am
not
clear
about
what
requirements?
mr.
raymond
randolph
section
1638
of
the
act
and
the
regulations,
section
226.8.
mr.
raymond
randolph
page
13a
of
the
appendix,
i
have
been
called
by
my
colleague.
mr.
raymond
randolph
of
the
appendix
to
petitioners,
to
respondent's
brief
page
13a.
well,
that
just
gives
a
general
rule
226
where
all
the
detailed
disclosures
that
i
have
described
are
set
forth
after
that
in
the
section.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
that.
they
said
this
is
a
conclusive
presumption;
therefore
it's
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
we
think
that
reasoning
is
faulty
for
the
reasons
we
have
explained
in
our
brief.
we
think
that
characterizing
this
rule
is
a
conclusive
presumption,
aids
analysis
not
at
all.
the
entire
truth
in
lending
act
is
a
conclusive
presumption
because
what
it
does
is
presumes
that
regardless
of
who
the
consumer
is,
he
needs
this
information.
regardless
of
whether
he
is
william
mcchesney
martin
buying
furniture
or
john
kenneth
galbraith,
the
creditor
still
has
to
disclose.
but
we
do
think
it
is
the
significant
and
important
thing,
is
the
regulation
reasonable
with
respect
to
the
objects
sought
to
be
achieved.
the
reasons
i
have
just
stated
and
the
reasons
my
counsel
stated
or
co-counsel
stated,
i
think
confirm
that
it
is
reasonable
and
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes,
they
said
that
not
even
congress.
so
this
legislation
is
pending
would
be
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
or
whatever
passed.
mr.
raymond
randolph
but
if
the
court
were
to
rule
in
our
favor
we
would
suggest
that
they
would
have
to
over
turn
that
particular
aspect
of
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
and
i
would
just
like
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
i
would
just
want
to
like
to
add
one
more
thing.
one
of
the
important
things
under
the
due
process
clause
is
a
question
of
benefit
burden
analysis.
i
mean,
what
are
the
benefits?
well,
i
have
talked
at
length
about
the
benefits
of
this
four
installment
rule.
what
are
the
burdens?
the
burdens
are
virtually
minimal
on
the
creditor
particularly
in
this
situation
where
they
have
a
standard
form
contract
and
it
means
just
setting
up
few
more
lines.
for
all
those
reasons,
we
think
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
should
be
reversed.
mr.
raymond
randolph
that
is
the
philosophy
mr.
chief
justice
you
may
not
be
realizing
if
you
are
paraphrasing
section
1601
of
the
act
which
says
to
assure
a
meaningful
disclosure
of
credit
terms,
so
the
consumer
will
be
able
to
compare
the
credit
terms
available
to
him
more
readily.
in
other
words,
we
want
people
operating
with
their
eyes
open
in
these
transactions.
it
doesn't
protect
people
from
making
mistakes.
one
thing
i
haven't
mentioned
is
mrs.
mourning
would
be
technically
still
liable
on
this
contract,
even
regardless
of
her
civil
recovery
in
this
suit.
in
that
sense
the
civil
penalty
section
is
really
kind
of
compensatory.
what
it
gives
is,
there's
$100
although
she
is
still
obligated
on
the
contract.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes
i
have.
mr.
raymond
randolph
i
would
not
agree
with
that
it
followed
that
there
would
be
no
finance
charge.
what
i
would
say
is
that
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
that
question
–
may
i
back
up
to
the
question
that
i
was
about
to
earlier
question,
the
statement
i
was
about
to
make,
i
think
that
just
because
the
cash
prize
is
the
same
as
the
installment
prize,
it
does
not
follow
that
there
is
no
finance
charge
hidden
in
the
installment
prize.
what
it
may
mean
is
that
there
is
a
finance
that
both
cash
customers
and
installment
customers
are
paying
for
the
cost
of
credit.
that’s
a
very
typical
situation
in
low
income
neighborhood
where
for
example,
the
creditor
does
very
little
cash
business
and
can't
afford
do
that.
now
as
to
the
question
whether
in
fact,
if
you
had
a
situation
where
there
was
no
cost
of
credit
and
nothing
in
the
price
of
the
goods.
i
think
that
the
act
would
cover
that
situation
but
what
it
would
require
the
consumer
to
do
is
in
every
situation
there
is
a
cost
of
credit,
regardless
of
whether
the
seller
says
i
am
charging
for
this
or
not.
a
part
of
his
cost
of
doing
business
is
in
the
selling
price
and
so
even
if
he
extends
credits
and
says
i
am
not
going
to
charge
you
anything.
what
he
is
in
fact
doing?
he
is
taking
a
lower
profit,
i
mean
that’s
another
way
of
characterizing.
if
he
wanted
--
if
a
consumer
wanted
to
cover
a
person
like
that
what
he
would
have
to
do
is
bring
an
action
with
the
team
of
the
accountants
to
break
down
those
book
keeping
practices
to
show
exactly
what
percentage
cost
of
credit
was
in
this
operating
expenses
which
went
into
the
selling
process.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes
but
not
one
that
has
to
be
calculated
and
what
the
board's
rule
does
is
dispense
with
that
because
they
base
their
rule
in
the
economic
fact
that
at
anytime
you
have
credit
extended
over
four
installments,
there's
going
to
be
a
finance
charge
upon.
mr.
raymond
randolph
congress
assumed
the
same
thing
incidentally
on
page
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
in
page
13
of
our
brief
i
believe
is
13.
on
page
15
of
our
brief
footnote
13,
i
think
we
have
about
20
references
where
this
situation
is
mentioned
during
hearings.
every
time
it
was
mentioned
the
congress,
--
no
matter
whoever
the
expert
was
testifying
but
what
that
just
means
that
the
cost
of
credit
is
more
than
selling
price.
mr.
raymond
randolph
he
might
not
realize
it,
no.
mr.
raymond
randolph
in
sears
and
roebuck.
mr.
raymond
randolph
sorry.
mr.
raymond
randolph
without
the
four
installment
rule,
with
the
four
installment
rule
because
it
would
depend
on
whether
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
my
position
on
--
and
i
have
discussed
the
situation
with
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
position
is
that
in
that
type
of
situation,
the
only
way
would
be,
the
only
way
that
creditor
would
be
is
if
the
consumer
could
come
in
and
so
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
is
charging,
making
a
lower
profit
but
nevertheless
part
of
his
selling
price
one
component
of
that
selling
price
is
cost
of
credit.
it’s
just
part
of
the
cost
of
doing
business
which
is
always
in
the
selling
price.
and
when
you
get
beyond
that
then
you
get
a
profit.
i
might
add
that
during
the
hearings,
on
page
15
of
our
brief
in
footnote
14,
we
mentioned
a
statement
by
senator
proxmire,
it
was
said,
“i
see
then
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
fois,
you
don't
pay
a
carrying
charge
of
any
kind”.
obviously
what
fois
is
doing
is
bearing
the
charge
in
the
cost
of
merchandise.
counsel
for
fps
is
stated
that
a
few
seconds
later,
senator
proxmire
said
oh,
“apparently
you
are
not
charging
a
finance
charge
for
this
merchandise
fois
wasn’t.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention;
i
am
not
sure
where
is
that
in
their
brief,
to
the
testimony
that
preceded
senator
proxmire's
statement
because
what
he
was
told
was
fois
went
out
of
business
with
respect
to
this
merchandise.
his
reply
was
oh,
they
were
in
charging
a
finance
charge.
i
think
there
was
a
touch
of
sarcasm
in
that
response.
mr.
raymond
randolph
no
not
as
a
matter
of
law.
this
is
why
the
board
made
the
rule
four
installments.
in
the
legislative
history
there
is
in
both
the
house
of
senate
reports,
the
statements
that
the
reason
congress
required
or
set
finance
charge
with
respect
to
creditors
was
that
they
did
not
want
to
cover
30,
60,
90
day
accounts
or
trade
accounts
because
they
consider
them
the
essentially
cash
transactions
and
what
the
board
did
consider
in
more
that
three
installment
rule.
mr.
raymond
randolph
well
i
think
it
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
was
congress's
judgment
that
these
smaller
transactions
over
a
small
period
of
time
were
essentially
cash
transactions
meaning
that
there
maybe
finance
charges
involved
as
the
de
minimis
situation,
everyone
has
always
treated
these
as
rather
as
cash
transactions
and
we
do
not
want
to
upset
that
type
of
business
activity
because
the
benefit
to
the
consumer
would
be
minimal
whereas
what
we
are
really
aiming
out
a
longer
term
installment.
mr.
raymond
randolph
that
is
congress's
judgment
i
think
it
is
on
page,
yes
page,
at
the
top
of
the
page
20
of
our
brief.
so
requirement
would
not
applied
to
transactions
which
are
not
commonly
thought
of
as
credit
transactions
including
trade
credit,
open
account
credit
30,
60,
90
day
credit
etcetera
for
which
charge
is
not
made.
this
is
the
legislative
history
that
board
looked
at
and
said
well,
we
have
to
have
a
rule
that
covers
transactions
beyond
this
because
the
reason
congress
put
the
finance
charge
in
there
as
they
did
not
want
these
transactions
covered.
i
might
add
that
the
board
as
my
colleague
said
it
was
involved
in
this
legislation
from
the
very
beginning,
constantly
testifying
before
congress
both
before
and
after
the
act
became
effective.
this
legislation
that
we
have
been
talking
about
that
passed
the
senate
was
that
the
board's
urging,
i
think
we
filed
with
the
court
that
the
report
that
the
board
files
with
congress
every
year
which
was
an
annual
report
and
they
suggested
that
congress
put
this
legislation.
and
despite
the
fact,
this
case
was
in
the
supreme
court,
that
is
how
critical
we
would
think
the
four
installment
rule
is.
mr.
raymond
randolph
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
about
pending
legislation.
that
is
pointed
out
on
the
page
6
of
the
government's
brief
in
footnote
8.
what
happened
to
the
legislation
was
that
it
passed
senate,
the
legislation
essentially
enacted
into
the
--
as
an
amendment
to
the
act
of
four
installment
rule,
that's
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
legislation
did
pass
the
senate,
but
it
was
not
reported
out
of
the
house
banking
and
currency
committee
in
time
before
congress
adjourned.
this
legislation
has
essentially
died
for
this
term.
the
other
question,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
at
the
beginning,
mr.
chief
justice
burger's
question
with
regard
to
evidence
in
the
case
as
to
what
publisher's
charge
for
these
magazines
subscription
would
have
been.
i
take
it
that
question
is
directed
to
determining
whether
in
fact
there
is
varied
finance
charged
in
this
transaction.
the
proper
comparison
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
submit,
would
be
not
what
the
publishers
charge,
but
what
family
publications
would
have
charged
a
cash
customer,
a
person
that
was
willing
to
pay
the
entire
amount
online
when
they
contracted
for
the
magazines
as
opposed
to
what
they
charged
someone
who
would
defer
the
payment
over
a
longer
period
of
time
such
as
mrs.
mourning.
mr.
raymond
randolph
that
might
be,
but
i
think
that
if
the
--
if
you
can
show
--
if
one
could
show
that
the
a
cash
customer
pays
less
than
a
time
customer,
there
is
direct
legislative
history
to
show
that's
considered
just
simply
another
way
of
saying
we
are
charging
you
for
something
more
for
paying
overtime
which
essentially
is
a
finance
charge.
in
the
district
court,
an
affidavit
was
submitted
by
the
vice
president
of
family
publications
services.
that
affidavit
read
as
follows.
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
it
said,
there
is
no
discount
for
paying
at
once
and
no
charge
for
paying
over
24
or
30
months.
however,
now
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
but
that's
what
that
affidavit
would
lead
one
to
believe.
however,
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
we
find
on
page
3
of
family
publications
service's
brief
in
the
second
footnote,
the
admission
that
contrary
to
representations
made
below,
cash
customers
do
in
fact
get
a
discount.
statement
is
made
that
cash
customers
only
represent
1%
of
family
publication's
total
customers,
but
that's
not
the
relevant
figure.
i
have
inquired
as
to
what
exactly,
how
much
this
discount
is
and
apparently
that's
not
known.
i
have
inquired
as
to
exactly
what
percentage
of
cash
customers
get
a
discount
and
that's
not
known.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes,
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
raymond
randolph
i
think
it
would.
i
think
i
can
bring
to
light
how
that
does
bear
on
the
issue.
mr.
raymond
randolph
i
think
it
confirms
congress's
judgment
and
board's
judgment
that
whenever
a
credit
is
extended
for
any
appreciable
length
of
time
that
costs
are
incurred
by
the
creditor.
as
an
economic
fact,
he
must
incur
cost
and
those
costs
are
contains
as
some
components
of
selling
price
regardless
of
whether
he
differentiates
it
out
for
the
consumer
or
not.
mr.
raymond
randolph
this
regulation
applies
regardless
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
i
would
maintain
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
that's
right.
but
what
i
am
about
to
appose
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
theoretically
a
transaction
without
a
finance
charge
is
some
component
of
selling
price
as
possible.
practically,
it
would
not
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
no.
mr.
raymond
randolph
that's
right,
because
we
first
of
all
say
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
define
creditors,
those
who
regularly
extend
finance
charges.
now
they
are
people
that
have
to
disclose
under
the
act.
there
will
be
no
problem
at
all
in
applying
this
provision
if
every
creditor
simply
said,
my
finance
charge
is
this,
my
selling
price
is
this.
no
difficultly.
but
there
are
some
creditors
that
have
never,
perhaps
never
differentiated
the
cost
of
credit
from
the
selling
price
of
the
goods.
apparent
reason
being
that
they
sold
primarily
all
their
goods
on
credit
and
there
would
be
no
reason
for
them
without
a
disclosure
requirement
for
it
to
differentiate.
they
would
say
my
price
is
$120
payable
in
10
monthly
installments
for
one
year
or
10
monthly
installments
over
a
period
of
time.
that
will
be
all
they
tell
the
consumer.
the
question
is
what
is
going
to
be
done
about
those
transactions?
well,
the
assumption
throughout
the
congressional
hearings,
and
seven
years
of
congressional
hearings
is
that
whenever
a
creditor
said
or
a
retailer
said
there
is
no
charge
for
credit,
that
simply
meant
that
somewhere
in
that
selling
price,
a
component
of
that
selling
price
was
the
cost
of
credit
to
the
retailer.
now
this
assumption
is
based
on
a
very
simple
economic
fact.
whenever
the
seller
extends
credit
for
any
appreciable
length
of
time
incurs
cost.
now
we
maintain
that
this
case
is
no
exception.
fps
sent
letters
to
mrs.
mourning
and
that
cost
the
money
that
they
would
not
have
had
to
incur
if
they
operated
on
a
cash
business.
they
took
legal
action
against
those
who
defaulted
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
page
19
of
the
appendix,
fps
tells
mrs.
mourning,
they
don't
want
to
do
that
to
her
because
it's
very
expensive.
that's
another
cost
that
they
would
not
have
incurred
if
they
operated
on
a
cash
basis.
they
ran
collection
offices
in
florida
for
people
who
were
late
in
their
payments.
this
is
revealed
on
page
25
and
27
of
the
appendix,
and
fps
itself
told
mrs.
mourning
that
had
paid
for
this
merchandise
before
it
received
payment
for
mrs.
mourning.
we
don't
know
whether
fps
ran
credit
checks
or
had
a
bad
debt
reserve
or
anything
of
that
sort,
whether
it
had
to
borrow
money
to
pay
for
these
magazine
subscriptions,
but
we
do
know
that
every
transaction
for
any
appreciable
length
of
time,
the
cost
of
creditor
is
going
to
be
incurred.
that
would
not
be
incurred
if
they
ran
a
cash
business.
the
problem
that
faced
the
federal
reserve
board
is
what
they
do
about
this,
because
their
solution
is
the
four
installment
rule.
now
before
the
ink
was
even
dry
on
this
bill,
the
federal
reserve
board
began
the
task
of
setting
the
act
in
motion.
as
my
co-counsel
has
explained,
the
federal
reserve
board
was
involved
in
this
legislation
from
the
very
beginning,
it
testified
many
times
before
congress
and
took
an
active
part
in
consideration
of
the
legislation.
congress
in
fact
delayed
the
effective
date
of
the
act
for
one
year
in
order
to
allow
the
board
time
to
set
up
regulation
to
implement
it
or
in
the
words
of
the
house
report
on
page
19,
this
formulation
such
“substantive“
regulation
so
necessary
for
effective
enforcement
of
the
act”.
what
did
the
board
do?
the
first
thing
it
did
was
it
set
up
a
task
force
drawn
from
the
staffs
of
various
federal
reserve
banks
around
the
country
and
from
its
own
staff.
it
drew
upon
retail
credit
experts
to
look
at
these
problems.
it
drew
upon
vice
presidents
of
various
federal
reserve
banks,
the
actuary,
the
treasury
was
drawn
in.
it
set
up
an
advisory
panel
of
20
members
representing
retailer
and
lender
and
consumer
groups
from
every
section
of
the
country
and
headed
by
the
dean
of
the
berkley
school
of
business
and
after
they
studied
this
problem,
as
i
said
their
solution
was
the
four
installment
rule,
but
the
board
didn't
stop
there.
on
page
19
of
our
brief
in
footnote
22,
there
is
an
explanation
of
what
the
four
installment
rule
is
all
about
and
why
the
board
did
it.
this
is
testimony
from
vice
chairman
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
robinson,
it's
before
the
regulations
took
effect
and
he
is
testifying
before
the
very
committee
of
congress
that
enacted
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
explaining
exactly
what
the
board
did
before
the
regulations
take
effect.
in
that
testimony,
what
i
have
just
described
is
as
far
as
the
promulgating
process
is
concerned,
is
confirmed.
the
other
thing
that
board
did
was
undertake
a
massive
campaign
to
inform
creditors
of
exactly
what
there
obligations
would
be
and
what
the
board
called
z
day
which
is
when
regulation
z
took
effect
in
july
of
1969.
it
distributed
a
million
and
half
of
these
pamphlets
which
describe
in
detail
exactly
every
creditor's
obligations
and
they
were
distributed
to
every
known
person
or
firm
extending
consumer
credit
in
the
country.
the
board
also
ran
seminars
in
the
federal
reserve
bank
and
the
other
informational
services.
mr.
raymond
randolph
let
me
go
in
down
what
--
let's
the
usual
case
and
this
is
one
where
there
is
no
finance
charge
differentiated
from
the
cost.
in
four
installment
rule
is
what,
they
would
have
had
to
say
the
down
payment.
now
the
fps
contract
that
is
set
out
on
pages
6-7
of
the
appendix,
it
will
be
helpful
to
follow
that.
they
did
that.
they
said,
pay
only
$3.95
down.
the
next
thing
they
would
have
had
to
do
is
give
the
number,
amount
and
due
dates
of
the
payments.
now
we
think
they
substantially
complied
with
that,
they
said,
395
each
month
for
30
months.
of
course,
if
the
truth
in
lending
act
doesn't
apply,
the
next
contract
fps
rights
could
say
395
a
month
for
two-and-half
years.
there
will
be
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that
but
they
did
that
in
this
case.
the
next
thing
they
would
have
had
to
tell
mrs.
mourning
is
the
total
of
payments.
they
did
not
disclose
this
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
no
the
30
times
395.
mr.
raymond
randolph
but
payments
she
would
have
to
make
after
the
salesman
walked
out
the
door.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes
it's
interesting
i
think
mr.
justice
that
on
page
17
is
the
first
time,
the
family
publications
did
that
modification
for
mrs.
mourning,
you
will
notice
they
say
the
time
is
here
now,
we
cannot
wait
any
longer
for
your
payment.
we
give
you
48
hours
to
forward
the
entire
balance
of
a
$118.50.
they
had
the
courtesy
to
mollify
it
for
their.
the
next
thing
is
the
cash
prize.
now
this
is
interesting,
fps
never
disclosed.
so
there
is
no
indication
of
what
their
cash
prize
is
here
but
now
we
know
as
i
stated
early
in
my
argument
that
there
was
a
cash
prize
but
we
don't
know
how
much
it
was
and
neither
did
mrs.
mourning.
mr.
raymond
randolph
it
was
lowered
we
know
that.
i
think
that
i
might
digress
you
for
a
moment.
this
is
one
of
the
main
points
of
the
four
installment
rule
2
in
addition
to
preventing
certain
invention
and
evasion.
it
gives
creditors
an
easy
rule
to
follow
and
no
charge
for
credit
transactions.
they
know
that
they
don't
have
to
away
the
consumer's
action
against
them
to
prove
exactly
and
calculate
what
their
finance
charge
was,
if
the
consumer
could
ever
prove
that.
but
it
gives
them
a
clear
rule
to
follow
and
maybe
the
fps
never
thought
they
charged
the
finance
charge.
i
remember
doing
the
hearings
that
sears
and
roebucks
company
came
in
before
senator
douglas
who
was
the
principal
sponsor
claiming,
we
charge
no
finance
charges.
it
took
senator
douglas
five
pages
of
testimony
in
a
computer
to
prove
to
them
then
they
in
fact
did.
after
which
they
admitted
it.
so
it's
not
all
purposeful
evasion,
it's
misunderstanding
too.
okay,
so
we
don't
know
the
finding.
the
next
thing
is
the
amount
financed
which
would
be
the
cash
prize
minus
the
down-payment,
of
course
we
don't
know
this
either
because
we
don't
know
what
in
fact
the
cash
prize
is
now.
and
then
final
thing
will
be
the
differed
payment
prize
which
will
be
everything.
finance
charge,
the
cash
prize,
the
down-payment
and
all
additional
charges.
in
this
case
we
come
to
a
$122.45.
none
of
this
was
told
to
mrs.
mourning.
we
throughout
this
litigation
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
randolph
well,
i
think
that
one
of
the
major
points,
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
is
that
if
you
were
a
mathematician,
you
might
be
able
to
get
all
the
information
by
taking
certain
figures
and
juggling
around
that
a
creditor
is
required
to
disclosed
under
the
act.
two
things,
everyone
is
not
a
mathematician
and
second
in
the
pressure
of
a
sale,
when
the
seller
is
emphasizing
the
merchandise,
the
amount
of
money,
you
can
afford
this.
people
may
not
be
able
to
conduct
themselves
so
that
they
would
sit
down
with
a
pencil
and
realize
their
obligations.
throughout
this
litigation,
i
think
it's
interesting
that
fps
has
never
said
why
don't
they
want
to
tell
their
customers
this?
it's
not
going
to
cost
them
very
much
money;
this
is
a
standard
form
of
contract.
they
could
run
them
off
by
the
thousands
at
very
little
expense
but
putting
in
a
few
more
lines,
describing
what
i
said,
it
maybe
that
they
don't
want
their
salesmen
to
go
to
people
and
say
how
do
you
like
to
buy
some
magazines
for
a
$122.45
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
that's
exactly
right
mr.
justice
–-
mr.
raymond
randolph
they
give
them
information
and
if
they
want
to
make
mistakes
at
least,
they
will
have
the
information
before
them.
mr.
raymond
randolph
sorry,
i
am
not
clear
about
what
requirements?
mr.
raymond
randolph
section
1638
of
the
act
and
the
regulations,
section
226.8.
mr.
raymond
randolph
page
13a
of
the
appendix,
i
have
been
called
by
my
colleague.
mr.
raymond
randolph
of
the
appendix
to
petitioners,
to
respondent's
brief
page
13a.
well,
that
just
gives
a
general
rule
226
where
all
the
detailed
disclosures
that
i
have
described
are
set
forth
after
that
in
the
section.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
that.
they
said
this
is
a
conclusive
presumption;
therefore
it's
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
we
think
that
reasoning
is
faulty
for
the
reasons
we
have
explained
in
our
brief.
we
think
that
characterizing
this
rule
is
a
conclusive
presumption,
aids
analysis
not
at
all.
the
entire
truth
in
lending
act
is
a
conclusive
presumption
because
what
it
does
is
presumes
that
regardless
of
who
the
consumer
is,
he
needs
this
information.
regardless
of
whether
he
is
william
mcchesney
martin
buying
furniture
or
john
kenneth
galbraith,
the
creditor
still
has
to
disclose.
but
we
do
think
it
is
the
significant
and
important
thing,
is
the
regulation
reasonable
with
respect
to
the
objects
sought
to
be
achieved.
the
reasons
i
have
just
stated
and
the
reasons
my
counsel
stated
or
co-counsel
stated,
i
think
confirm
that
it
is
reasonable
and
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes,
they
said
that
not
even
congress.
so
this
legislation
is
pending
would
be
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
or
whatever
passed.
mr.
raymond
randolph
but
if
the
court
were
to
rule
in
our
favor
we
would
suggest
that
they
would
have
to
over
turn
that
particular
aspect
of
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
and
i
would
just
like
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
i
would
just
want
to
like
to
add
one
more
thing.
one
of
the
important
things
under
the
due
process
clause
is
a
question
of
benefit
burden
analysis.
i
mean,
what
are
the
benefits?
well,
i
have
talked
at
length
about
the
benefits
of
this
four
installment
rule.
what
are
the
burdens?
the
burdens
are
virtually
minimal
on
the
creditor
particularly
in
this
situation
where
they
have
a
standard
form
contract
and
it
means
just
setting
up
few
more
lines.
for
all
those
reasons,
we
think
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
should
be
reversed.
mr.
raymond
randolph
that
is
the
philosophy
mr.
chief
justice
you
may
not
be
realizing
if
you
are
paraphrasing
section
1601
of
the
act
which
says
to
assure
a
meaningful
disclosure
of
credit
terms,
so
the
consumer
will
be
able
to
compare
the
credit
terms
available
to
him
more
readily.
in
other
words,
we
want
people
operating
with
their
eyes
open
in
these
transactions.
it
doesn't
protect
people
from
making
mistakes.
one
thing
i
haven't
mentioned
is
mrs.
mourning
would
be
technically
still
liable
on
this
contract,
even
regardless
of
her
civil
recovery
in
this
suit.
in
that
sense
the
civil
penalty
section
is
really
kind
of
compensatory.
what
it
gives
is,
there's
$100
although
she
is
still
obligated
on
the
contract.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes
i
have.
mr.
raymond
randolph
i
would
not
agree
with
that
it
followed
that
there
would
be
no
finance
charge.
what
i
would
say
is
that
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
that
question
–
may
i
back
up
to
the
question
that
i
was
about
to
earlier
question,
the
statement
i
was
about
to
make,
i
think
that
just
because
the
cash
prize
is
the
same
as
the
installment
prize,
it
does
not
follow
that
there
is
no
finance
charge
hidden
in
the
installment
prize.
what
it
may
mean
is
that
there
is
a
finance
that
both
cash
customers
and
installment
customers
are
paying
for
the
cost
of
credit.
that’s
a
very
typical
situation
in
low
income
neighborhood
where
for
example,
the
creditor
does
very
little
cash
business
and
can't
afford
do
that.
now
as
to
the
question
whether
in
fact,
if
you
had
a
situation
where
there
was
no
cost
of
credit
and
nothing
in
the
price
of
the
goods.
i
think
that
the
act
would
cover
that
situation
but
what
it
would
require
the
consumer
to
do
is
in
every
situation
there
is
a
cost
of
credit,
regardless
of
whether
the
seller
says
i
am
charging
for
this
or
not.
a
part
of
his
cost
of
doing
business
is
in
the
selling
price
and
so
even
if
he
extends
credits
and
says
i
am
not
going
to
charge
you
anything.
what
he
is
in
fact
doing?
he
is
taking
a
lower
profit,
i
mean
that’s
another
way
of
characterizing.
if
he
wanted
--
if
a
consumer
wanted
to
cover
a
person
like
that
what
he
would
have
to
do
is
bring
an
action
with
the
team
of
the
accountants
to
break
down
those
book
keeping
practices
to
show
exactly
what
percentage
cost
of
credit
was
in
this
operating
expenses
which
went
into
the
selling
process.
mr.
raymond
randolph
yes
but
not
one
that
has
to
be
calculated
and
what
the
board's
rule
does
is
dispense
with
that
because
they
base
their
rule
in
the
economic
fact
that
at
anytime
you
have
credit
extended
over
four
installments,
there's
going
to
be
a
finance
charge
upon.
mr.
raymond
randolph
congress
assumed
the
same
thing
incidentally
on
page
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
in
page
13
of
our
brief
i
believe
is
13.
on
page
15
of
our
brief
footnote
13,
i
think
we
have
about
20
references
where
this
situation
is
mentioned
during
hearings.
every
time
it
was
mentioned
the
congress,
--
no
matter
whoever
the
expert
was
testifying
but
what
that
just
means
that
the
cost
of
credit
is
more
than
selling
price.
mr.
raymond
randolph
he
might
not
realize
it,
no.
mr.
raymond
randolph
in
sears
and
roebuck.
mr.
raymond
randolph
sorry.
mr.
raymond
randolph
without
the
four
installment
rule,
with
the
four
installment
rule
because
it
would
depend
on
whether
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
my
position
on
--
and
i
have
discussed
the
situation
with
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
position
is
that
in
that
type
of
situation,
the
only
way
would
be,
the
only
way
that
creditor
would
be
is
if
the
consumer
could
come
in
and
so
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
is
charging,
making
a
lower
profit
but
nevertheless
part
of
his
selling
price
one
component
of
that
selling
price
is
cost
of
credit.
it’s
just
part
of
the
cost
of
doing
business
which
is
always
in
the
selling
price.
and
when
you
get
beyond
that
then
you
get
a
profit.
i
might
add
that
during
the
hearings,
on
page
15
of
our
brief
in
footnote
14,
we
mentioned
a
statement
by
senator
proxmire,
it
was
said,
“i
see
then
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
fois,
you
don't
pay
a
carrying
charge
of
any
kind”.
obviously
what
fois
is
doing
is
bearing
the
charge
in
the
cost
of
merchandise.
counsel
for
fps
is
stated
that
a
few
seconds
later,
senator
proxmire
said
oh,
“apparently
you
are
not
charging
a
finance
charge
for
this
merchandise
fois
wasn’t.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention;
i
am
not
sure
where
is
that
in
their
brief,
to
the
testimony
that
preceded
senator
proxmire's
statement
because
what
he
was
told
was
fois
went
out
of
business
with
respect
to
this
merchandise.
his
reply
was
oh,
they
were
in
charging
a
finance
charge.
i
think
there
was
a
touch
of
sarcasm
in
that
response.
mr.
raymond
randolph
no
not
as
a
matter
of
law.
this
is
why
the
board
made
the
rule
four
installments.
in
the
legislative
history
there
is
in
both
the
house
of
senate
reports,
the
statements
that
the
reason
congress
required
or
set
finance
charge
with
respect
to
creditors
was
that
they
did
not
want
to
cover
30,
60,
90
day
accounts
or
trade
accounts
because
they
consider
them
the
essentially
cash
transactions
and
what
the
board
did
consider
in
more
that
three
installment
rule.
mr.
raymond
randolph
well
i
think
it
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
was
congress's
judgment
that
these
smaller
transactions
over
a
small
period
of
time
were
essentially
cash
transactions
meaning
that
there
maybe
finance
charges
involved
as
the
de
minimis
situation,
everyone
has
always
treated
these
as
rather
as
cash
transactions
and
we
do
not
want
to
upset
that
type
of
business
activity
because
the
benefit
to
the
consumer
would
be
minimal
whereas
what
we
are
really
aiming
out
a
longer
term
installment.
mr.
raymond
randolph
that
is
congress's
judgment
i
think
it
is
on
page,
yes
page,
at
the
top
of
the
page
20
of
our
brief.
so
requirement
would
not
applied
to
transactions
which
are
not
commonly
thought
of
as
credit
transactions
including
trade
credit,
open
account
credit
30,
60,
90
day
credit
etcetera
for
which
charge
is
not
made.
this
is
the
legislative
history
that
board
looked
at
and
said
well,
we
have
to
have
a
rule
that
covers
transactions
beyond
this
because
the
reason
congress
put
the
finance
charge
in
there
as
they
did
not
want
these
transactions
covered.
i
might
add
that
the
board
as
my
colleague
said
it
was
involved
in
this
legislation
from
the
very
beginning,
constantly
testifying
before
congress
both
before
and
after
the
act
became
effective.
this
legislation
that
we
have
been
talking
about
that
passed
the
senate
was
that
the
board's
urging,
i
think
we
filed
with
the
court
that
the
report
that
the
board
files
with
congress
every
year
which
was
an
annual
report
and
they
suggested
that
congress
put
this
legislation.
and
despite
the
fact,
this
case
was
in
the
supreme
court,
that
is
how
critical
we
would
think
the
four
installment
rule
is.
