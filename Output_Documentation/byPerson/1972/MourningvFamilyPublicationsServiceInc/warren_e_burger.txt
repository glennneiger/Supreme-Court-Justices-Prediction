chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
first
this
morning
in
number
71-829,
mourning
against
family
publications.
mr.
schnapper,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
help
me
counsel,
because
i
wonder
if
--
i
am
not
sure
i
have
spelled
it
out
accurately.
what
would
be
the
price
of
each
of
these
if
you
just
subscribe
by
mail
in
the
ordinary
course?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that's
not
important
to
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
it's
an
inflated
price
on
a
package
deal
in
order
to
conceal
carrying
charges,
isn't
that
pretty
important?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
the
classical
usury
cases,
isn't
it
ordinarily
an
important
factor
of
evidence
to
show
that
the
automobile,
particular
automobile
had
listed
price,
a
cash
price
and
a
time
price.
that's
the
way
you
improve
your
concealed
usury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
under
these
regulations
that
becomes
irrelevant
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
total
price
you
mean
$120?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
later
that,
i
am
even
more
puzzled,
why
record
does
not
contain
the
figures
on
the
publisher’s
subscription
price
for
each
of
these
magazine,
which
you
say
is
irrelevant
under
the
regulation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
just
emphasized
that
a
merchant
having
a
$100
price
tag
on
something
and
a
$120
timed
price
was
the
kind
of
an
evil
that
the
statute
was
trying
to
get
at?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
understand
the
thrust
of
the
legislation
alright,
when
you
get
away
from
the
legislation
and
get
down
to
a
specific
case
under
it
then
i
should
think
this
factor
would
be
of
some
interest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
to
pursue
that
i
think
a
related
question
as
soon
as
mrs.
mourning
signed
that
contract,
she
was
a
debtor
to
the
extent
of
$118.50,
wasn't
she?
she
had
made
a
promise
to
pay
118.50
to
someone
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
made
her
a
debtor
and
the
family
publications
a
creditor,
certainly?
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
this
is
an
exchange.
this
is
a
typical
classical
contract
situation
of
one
promise
exchange
for
another,
each
one
to
be
partially
performed
in
the
future?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
randolph.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
might
not
both
factors
be
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
because
they
are
not
in
the
business
of
selling
things
for
cash,
but
only
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
affidavit
in
our
files
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
doesn't
that
run
throughout
the
legislative
history
between
the
lines
as
well
as
on
the
surface
that
this
is
an
effort
to
protect
people
from
their
own
folly
to
a
degree.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
their
own
inadvertence—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
again,
what
you
just
mentioned?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
this
whole
act,
an
approach
to
abandon
the
old
idea
that
let
the
buyer
be
aware
and
substitute
preposition
that
the
buyer
must
know.
have
you
heard
about
what
it
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rifkind,
we
have
extended
the
time
of
your
offense
and
to
accommodate
that
your
time
will
be
enlarged
to
ten
minutes
if
you
need
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
mean,
sorry,
i
interrupted
there
a
bit,
do
you
mean
finance
charge
which
is
identified
as
such
or
finance
charge
which
is
determined
to
be
present
as
a
matter
of
economic
reality?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
think
it
would
not
be
relevant
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
in
an
attack
on
that
transaction,
that
in
fact
all
of
their
patients
who
paid
cash
or
within
90
days
would
charge
$1,000.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
a
very
big
penalty
in
the
circumstances,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
such
as
what
amount,
have
you
suggested
the
amount
in
your
brief
other
than
saying
it
was
a
staggering
amount?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress,
certainly
was
capable
of
making
that
calculation,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
something
like
trouble
damages
and.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
refkind
early
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
white
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
that
on
the
record
as
it
now
stands
the
court
was
in
a
position,
this
court
is
in
a
position
to
reach
a
determination
that
there
was
no
credit
transaction,
that
was
the
sentence
essentially?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
this
record
could
we
reach
the
contrary
determination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
it's
a
pure
question
of
law
that
would
be
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
where
is
the
enforceability
of
this
long
going
operation
as
compared
to
the
enforceability
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that's
certainly
true
on
a
prepaid
subscription
to
the
publisher
himself
but
this
was
a
tripod
type
arrangement
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
payment
was
made
by
your
client
to
the
publisher
and
your
client
thereby
became
creditor
of
mrs.
mourning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
most
of
them
have
a
gradient
stock
and
make
delivery
don't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fps
has
nothing
except
probably
a
general
understanding
that
when
as
and
if
they
send
in
a
subscription
with
some
money
on
some
terms,
contract
will
then
occur.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
suggested
i
think
earlier
there
is
no
primitive
contract
between
mrs.
mourning
and
the
magazine,
but
if
promptly
as
was
contemplated
after
the
making
of
this
contract,
fps
did
contract
with
the
magazine,
would
mrs.
mourning
be
possibly
a
third
party
beneficiary
who
could
enforce
that
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
am
speaking
in
just
the
pure
legal
terms.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
rifkind.
i
think
all
of
your
time
is
consumed
on
the
other
side.
the
case
is
submitted.
