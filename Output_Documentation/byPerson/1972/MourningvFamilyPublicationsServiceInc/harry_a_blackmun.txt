would
the

real

where
you
reserve
a
total
amount
of
rent
for
a
period
of
time
like
two
years,
payable
in
installments
over
two
years,
it's
certainly
be
beyond
the
foremost.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
why
not
under
all
circumstances?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
federally,
the
regulations
reads
right
on
it,
does
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
may
be
we
have
the
wrong
issue
up
here.
is
that
it?
the
only
issue
here
is
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
whether
there
was
credit
at
all.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
issue
here,
whether
there's
credit
at
all?
justice
harry
a.

did
you
bring
it
here
or
did
somebody
else?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
a
cross
petition?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
wouldn’t
be
any
credit
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
depends
upon
(inaudible)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
not
as
an
extension
of
credit.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
it
certainly
--
i
mean
otherwise,
you
would
think
as
mr.
justice
stewart
told
someone
else
have
brought
out,
it
might
be
that
the
buyer
was
extending
credit
to
the
publisher,
paying
in
advance
for
his
service.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
not
if
the
intermediary
family
publications
has
already
paid
the
publisher,
that's
why
i
say
the
fact
that
might
be
a
irrelevant
fact.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
be
you
have
forgotten
about
fact
that
we
say
it
must
be
on
the
plaintiff
side
not
yours?
