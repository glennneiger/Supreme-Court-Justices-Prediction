mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
first
case
to
reach
this
court
arising
out
of
one
of
the
most
important
federal
statute
for
the
protection
of
the
consumers.
the
truth
in
lending
act
of
1968.
that
statute
was
enacted
to
inform
consumers
about
the
cost
of
credit
and
about
the
other
terms
of
credit
transactions.
congress
was
particularly
concerned,
to
aid
consumers
like
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
a
75
year
old
widow
living
on
a
government
pension
of
$82.50
a
month,
who
can
ill
afford
high
finance
charges
or
excessive
financial
commitments.
defendant
admits
that
it
failed
to
make
several
disclosures
applied
by
the
regulations
of
federal
reserve
board
but
claims
that
those
regulations
are
invalid.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows.
on
august
19th,
1969
following
a
telephone
solicitation,
mrs.
mourning
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
defendant
family
publications
service
for
the
purchase
of
four
magazines.
the
contract
is
set
out
on
pages
6
and
7
of
the
printed
appendix.
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
mrs.
mourning
was
to
receive
life,
holiday,
ladies
home
journal
and
travel
and
camera
for
period
of
five
years.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
price
would
have
been.
mr.
eric
schnapper
under
the
terms
of
the
regulation
and
the
statute,
it's
not.
whether
or
not,
she
was
given
a
good
price
is
ultimately
something
that
she
under
our
economic
system
ought
to
been
able
to
determine
for
self.
one
of
the
problems
that
arises
out
of
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
disclose
the
total
price
of
the
goods
was
that
even
she
had
been
aware,
the
terms
offered
by
the
publisher
directly.
she
had
no
way
of
making
that
comparison.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
absent
the
regulation
it
would
be
necessary
to
inquire
about
the
general
practices
of
the
defendant
as
to
whether
or
not,
it
was
inflating
as
prices
--the
whole
purpose
of
the
regulation
was
to
make
that
very
detailed
and
complicated
factual
inquiry
unnecessary,
both
to
avoid
deterring
private
actions
such
as
this
one
and
to
make
sure
that
the
statute
itself
was
administrative,
otherwise
the
federal
reserve
board
and
other
enforcement
agencies
would
be
in
the
business
of
trying
to
compare
the
prices
for
other
magazines
or
bicycles
or
television
sets
with
the
prices
charged
in
contracts
like
this
for
all
the
consumer
contracts
that
are
signed
every
day
in
country.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
under
the
regulations
that
problem
is
not
the
one
that
has
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
board
or
by
plaintiffs
seeking
to
prove
that
the
information
should
have
been
disclosed.
mrs.
mourning
paid
$3.95
down
and
agreed
to
pay
$3.95
a
year
for
two-and-a-half
years.
the
contract
did
not
disclose
that
the
cost
of
magazines
was
$122.45
in
order
to
disclose
the
amount
due
after
the
down
payment
was
$118.50.
in
addition,
the
contract
did
not
disclose,
would
have
been
revealed
first
time,
the
first
time
in
this
court
by
the
defendant
that
if
mrs.
mourning
had
paid
cash
for
the
magazines,
she
might
well
have
paid
less
to
the
defendant
itself.
all
of
this
information
withheld
from
mrs.
mourning
by
the
defendant.
it
was
required
to
be
disclosed
two
consumers
in
credit
transactions
covered
by
the
truth
in
lending
act.
mrs.
mourning
refused
to
make
any
payments
under
the
contract
after
the
initial
down
payments.
on
december
of
16th,
1969
defendant
sent
mrs.
mourning
at
first
of
at
least
8
dunning
letters,
all
of
which
are
set
out
on
pages
14-21
of
the
printed
appendix.
the
first
letter
stated
that
fps
had
had
mrs.
mourning's
subscriptions
entered
for
the
entire
five
year
period
and
her
contract
could
not
be
canceled.
on
december
28th
of
that
year
fps
sent
mrs.
mourning
a
second
letter
stating
that
fps
had
paid
for
the
magazines
in
advance
and
that
mrs.
mourning
had
incurred
an
obligation
to
repay
fps.
the
letter
also
stated,
this
is
a
credit
account
and
as
such
must
be
repaid
by
you
on
a
monthly
basis
much
the
same
as
if
you
had
purchased
any
other
type
of
monthly,
any
other
type
of
merchandise
on
a
monthly
budget
plan.
on
april
23rd,
1970
mrs.
mourning
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida
suing
to
enforce
the
truth
in
lending
act,
federal
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
statute
expressly
conferred
upon
district
courts
by
section
1640
of
the
statute.
mrs.
mourning
in
her
amended
complaint
alleged
that
the
contract
with
fps
was
a
credit
transaction
covered
by
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
that
the
disclosures
required
by
the
act
had
not
been
made.
plaintiffs
sought
statutory
damage
of
$100
plus
legal
fees
and
cost.
fps
in
its
answer
asserted
three
defenses
relevant
here.
fps
urged
first
that
none
of
the
disclosure
provision
of
the
act
applied
to
this
transaction
because
the
contract
did
not
involve
the
finance
charge.
as
a
second
defense
fps
asserted
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
the
contract
because
fps
had
not
extended
credit
to
mrs.
mourning.
finally,
fps
maintained
that
even
if
the
contract
were
covered
by
the
act,
neither
mrs.
mourning
or
any
other
consumer
could
enforce
the
statute
because
fps
had
not
imposed
to
finance
charge
under
this
type
of
contract.
fps
concedes
however
that
it
did
not
make
the
disclosures
which
plaintiff
claims
are
legally
required.
on
october
30th,
1970
the
district
court
granted
mrs.
mourning's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that
court
ruled
that
the
transaction
was
subject
to
the
truth
in
lending
disclosure
requirements
because
the
purchase
price
was
payable
in
more
than
four
installments.
the
district
court
upheld
and
applied
the
four
installments
promulgated
by
the
federal
reserve
board
which
requires
that
disclosures
be
made
to
consumers
in
any
transaction
involving
more
than
four
installments
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
finance
charge
is
proved
and
would
have
been
imposed.
the
district
court
also
held
that
the
instant
contract
involved
the
extension
of
credit
by
fps
to
mrs.
mourning.
judgment
was
entered
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
the
amount
of
$100
plus
cost
and
attorney's
fees.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
appeal
and
order
the
complaint
dismissed.
in
an
opinion
by
judge
coleman,
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
four
installment
rule
required
fps
to
make
the
disclosures
withheld
in
this
case.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
rule
was
invalid
because
it
was
not
within
the
federal
reserve
board's
power
to
promulgate
regulations
under
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
four
installment
rule
was
unconstitutional
because
it
constituted
conclusive
presumptions
that
all
transactions
with
more
than
four
installments
involved
a
hidden
finance
charge.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
under
two
additional
defenses
raised
by
fps
and
the
district
court.
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
sought
in
this
court
to
review
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
validating
the
four
installment
rule.
fps
did
not
urged
in
the
proceedings
below
that
the
four
installment
rule
was
unconstitutional
and
expressly
does
not
rely
on
that
ground
before
this
court.
fps
does
argue
however,
that
four
installment
regulation
exceeded
the
board's
rule
making
authority
under
the
truth
in
lending
act.
statute
involved
was
enacted
in
1968
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
giving
to
consumers
a
meaningful
disclosure
of
credit
terms
so
that
the
consumer
would
be
able
to
compare
more
readily
the
various
credit
terms
available
to
him
and
to
avoid
the
uninformed
use
of
credit.
the
statute
arose
out
of
seven
years
of
hearings
and
committee
findings
that
consumers
were
generally,
unaware
of
the
terms
of
their
loans,
contracts
and
other
credit
transactions.
the
legislative
history
revealed
that
creditors
generally
withheld
vital
information
and
that
the
value
of
what
was
disclosed,
was
often
impaired
by
widely
disparate
terminology
and
accounting
methods.
in
addition
to
express
the
stated
purpose
quoted
contained
in
section
1601
of
the
act.
section
1604
of
the
statute
specifically
authorized
that
federal
reserve
board
to
promulgate
whatever
regulations
it
might
deem
necessary
or
proper
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
delegating
this
general
regulatory
responsibility
to
the
board,
congress
also
enacted
a
number
of
specific
provisions
requiring
several
disclosures
under
various
circumstances.
these
disclosures
include
price
of
the
goods,
the
amount
to
be
paid
after
the
down
payment,
the
finance
charge
involve
and
your
annual
interest
rate
of
finance
charge
expressed
as
a
percentage.
the
statute
and
regulations
also
require
the
standardized
terminology
be
used
to
facilitate
comparison
of
various
contract.
some
of
the
problems
as
to
how
the
purpose
of
meaningful
disclosure
would
be
achieved
and
dealt
with
detail
by
congress
in
these
substantive
provisions.
other
problems
were
left
untreated
for
resolution
by
the
board
itself.
congress
provided
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
regulations
will
be
left
primarily
to
private
parties
suing
such
as
mrs.
mourning
and
also
mandated
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
regulations
by
various
federal
agencies.
the
four
installment
rule
whose
validity
is
at
issue.
it's
contained
in
12
cfr
section
226.2(k)
and
it's
set
on
page
4
on
petitioners
brief.
the
effect
of
the
rule
is
to
require
disclosures
be
made
two
consumers,
in
any
credit
transactions
payable
on
more
than
for
installments,
regardless
of
whether
the
creditor
admits
to
imposing
a
finance
charge
in
that
transactions
or
others.
in
the
instant
case,
the
four
installment
rule
would
have
required
in
a
minimum
that
fps
disclosed
to
mrs.
mourning
that
total
price
of
the
magazines
and
the
amount
which
she
still
owed
fps
after
her
initial
down
payment.
mr.
eric
schnapper
$20.45.
whether
the
federal
reserve
board's
four
installment
rule
is
a
valid,
it
turns
upon
whether
it
was
within
the
board's
expressed
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
as
set
out
in
the
truth
in
lending
act
itself.
the
authority
of
the
board
is
defined
in
section
1604
of
the
statute
reproduced
on
pages
3
and
4
of
petitioner's
brief.
that
section
provides,
the
board
shall
prescribe
regulations
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
this
sub
chapter.
these
regulations
may
contain
such
classifications,
differentiations
or
other
provisions
and
may
provide
for
such
adjustments
or
exceptions
for
any
class
of
transactions
as
in
a
judgment
of
the
board
are
necessary
or
proper
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
this
sub-chapter
to
prevent
circumvention
or
evasion
thereof
or
to
facilitate
compliance
there
with.
the
four
installment
rule
is
necessary
first
to
prevent
evasion
of
the
substantive
requirement
contained
in
section
1638
of
the
act.
the
creditors
disclosed
to
consumers,
the
finance
charge
in
annual
interest
rate
imposed
in
any
credit
transaction.
in
the
normal
credit
sale
with
which
we
are
familiar,
the
merchant
imposes
one
charge
for
the
purchase
of
goods
for
cash
and
imposes
an
additional
separate
charge
for
the
privilege
of
paying
for
the
goods
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
congress
was
particularly
concerned
however,
that
the
amount
of
this
finance
charge
might
be
hidden
in
the
price
of
the
goods
themselves.
the
board
included
that
such
a
danger
was
very
real.
their
concern
was
for
example,
that
instead
of
charging
a
$100
for
television
set
and
$20
for
privilege
paying
for
over
two
years,
the
merchant
will
charge
$120
for
the
television
set
and
inform
the
consumer
that
the
credit
was
free.
such
a
merchant
would
naturally
assert
that
the
annual
interest
rate
involved
was
zero.
this
would
not
merely
leave
consumers
uninformed,
but
would
create
a
false
illusion
at
the
merchant's
credit
with
significantly
less
expensive
than
the
credit
of
lenders
such
as
banks
which
had
no
prices
in
which
they
could
vary
their
finance
charges.
the
congressional
hearings
indicated
that
varying
finance
charges
and
prices
was
a
problem
even
before
the
statute
was
enacted.
and
the
report
to
congress
by
the
federal
trade
commission
indicated
that
this
practice
of
hiring
finance
charges
and
prices
was
particularly
common
in
urban
ghettos.
rather
than
permit
retailers
to
thus
render
the
truth
in
lending
acts
requirement
of
disclosure
finance
charge
is
a
dead
letter.
the
federal
reserve
board
promulgated
the
four
installment
rule.
a
key
effect
of
this
rule
is
to
require
a
creditor
who
may
claim,
he
imposes
no
finance
charges
to
nonetheless
disclose
at
the
very
least,
the
total
price
of
the
goods
involved
in
any
transaction,
payable
within
four
installments.
the
board
apparently
reasoned
as
had
the
supporters
of
the
statute
while
it
was
being
considered
by
congress.
that
if
consumers
were
at
least
told
the
total
price
of
an
item,
they
could
compare
that
price
with
other
prices
and
determine
if
a
merchant
were
charging
more
than
the
normal
amount.
in
this
case
for
example
if
mrs.
mourning
had
been
told
the
total
prices
of
a
magazine,
it
was
a
$122.45.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
the
board
concluded--
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
regulation
is
designed
not
merely
to
facilitate
or
encourage
that
kind
of
case
by
case
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
was
a
hidden
finance
charge.
the
congressional
hearings
indicated
that
congress
felt
that
it
was
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
the
statute
stood
alone,
an
inquiry
would
be
necessary
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
creditor
regularly
extended
credit
for
which
the
finance
charge
was
required
and
that
would
be
the
case
because
section
1602
of
the
act
defining
creditor,
limits
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act
to
creditors
who
extend
credit
for
which
finance
charge
is
regularly
imposed.
however
–
mr.
eric
schnapper
only,
only
under
one
circumstance,
the
statute
provides--
mr.
eric
schnapper
because
–-
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
the
regulation
requires
there
be
an
extension
of
credit.
now,
the
statute
provides
that
certain
leases
will
be
treated
as
credit
sales.
i
mean
leases
which
provide
that
at
the
end
of
the
lease,
the
goods
were,
i
suppose
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that's
an
issue
that
has
been
raised
in
addition,
but
the
problem
you
raised
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
issue
is
here.
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
defendants
brought
it
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
there's
an
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it's
our
position
that
if
this
court
rules
that
the
four
installment
rule
is
invalid
and
feels
that
their
arguments
merit
detailed
consideration,
that
that
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit,
because
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
reach,
the
question
of
whether
credit
was
present
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
essential,
that's
essentially
correct.
there
are
some
conflicts
between
the
answer
and
the
evidence
as
presented
by
plaintiff
but
there
was
no
substantive
evidence
presented
by
the
defendant
for
example,
to
show
that
the
defendant
hadn't
in
fact
prepaid
publishers
to
some
extent
for
these
magazines.
and
other
facts
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
are
relevant,
clear
showing
that
credit
was
extended
in
this
case.
but
to
get
back
very
briefly
to
the
question
that
you
raised,
normal
lease,
for
example,
the
apartment
would
not
be
covered
by
the
statute
because
of
the
end
of
at
lease
the
apartment
revert
to
the
owner
of
the
building.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
wouldn't
be
any
credit.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that’s
correct
but
more
importantly
the
statute
distinguishes
those
kinds
of
cases
from
a
lease
in
which
at
the
end
of
the
lease
period,
the
property
goes
over
to
the
tenant
or
to
the
person
who's
renting
materials.
if,
for
example,
you
rent
a
television
for
$10
a
week
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
you
can
buy
it
for
a
nickel.
that's
treated
as
a
sale
under
the
act.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
would
be
a
separate
question
to
be
resolved,
but
in
the
case
of
a
television
set
of
course,
it
would
be
clear
that
the
reported
tenant,
lessee
of
the
goods
in
fact
had
a
possession
from
the
beginning.
in
these
cases,
as
the
evidence
shows,
the
facts
are
not
such
as
i
think
you
may
have
in
mind,
a
problem
where
the
goods
are
only
delivered
after
they
are
paid.
the
contract
in
fact,
involves
three
parties,
mrs.
mourning
who
bought
the
goods,
family
publication
service
and
the
publishers
which
was
a
different,
i
don't
know,
we
don't
know
exactly
how
many
publishers
there
were
involved.
now
the
letter,
the
dunning
letters
which
were
sent
to
mrs.
mourning
show
that,
first,
there
were
these
additional
parties
and
fps
was
not
in
fact
the
seller
or
a
publisher
of
the
magazines.
secondly,
that
assumes
the
right
roughly
after
the
contract
was
signed.
fps
turned
around
and
contracted
with
publishers
in
advance
to
deliver
all
the
magazines
to
mrs.
mourning
over
the
requisite
period.
third,
fps
stated
in
these
letters
and
the
evidence
wasn’t
contradicted
below
that
he
had
prepaid
to
some
extent
the
cost
of
the
magazines
and
they
told
mrs.
mourning
in
several
cases
that
she
owed
them
money
because
they
couldn't
get
a
refund
from
the
publishers.
now
there's
–
normally
it’s
not
the
simple
case
of
a
person
selling
a
television
set,
where
you
in
fact
that
have
three
parties,
but
as
fps
stated
in
one
of
the
letters
involved,
it
acted
as
really
as
a
financier
of
this
whole
operation.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
we
believe
not
because
under
the
realities
of
transaction
where
she
paid
for
magazines
before
she
got
them.
she
paid
for
them
after
fps
had
paid
out
money
to
the
publishers
so
that
she
had
a
debt
to
fps
to
cover
the
money
that
they
had
laid
out.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that’s
also
correct.
that's
the
normal
practice.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
our
economic
analysis
would
be
essentially
that
they
put
up
the
money
for
her
to
buy
the
subscription
and
she
paid
them
back.
now
the
record
doesn't
indicate
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
we
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
under
the
regulation,
that's
correct.
the
four
installment
rule
is
also
necessary
to
prevent
evasion
of
the
other
disclosure
requirements
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
requiring
disclosure
of
finance
charges,
the
statute
requires
the
disclosure
of
a
host
of
other
credit
terms,
the
amount
financed
and
the
price
of
the
goods,
time
and
number
of
payments.
if
however,
a
creditor
asserts
in
his
contract
that
he
does
not
impose
the
finance
charge,
a
serious
question
arises
under
the
face
of
the
statute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
creditor
need
to
disclose
anything
to
consumer
whether
by
having
first
hidden
his
finance
charge,
and
evaded
the
requirement
that
that
to
be
disclosed.
he
can
then
turn
around
and
evade
all
the
other
requirements
of
the
statute
and
claim
a
complete
exemption.
the
four
installment
rule
precludes
this
type
of
circumvention
as
well.
the
regulation
provides
that
the
usual
disclosures
must
be
made
in
any
transaction
involving
finance
charges
but
also
in
any
transaction
in
which
more
than
four
installments
are
involved.
the
rule
does
not
only
prevent
circumvention
of
the
act
in
this
way,
but
effectuates
the
expressly
stated
purpose
of
the
act
to
provide
consumers
with
credit
terms
of
their
transactions.
congress
expressly
delegated
to
the
federal
reserve
board
responsibility
for
deciding
when
it
was
a
danger
evasion
and
profession
and
remedies
to
be
involved
to
deal
with
that
danger.
the
board's
expertise
in
understanding
the
statute
goes
back
to
many
years
before
its
actual
enactment
because
the
board
was
intimately
involved
in
the
process
of
drafting
the
statute
through
the
congressional
hearings.
after
the
statute
put
draft
regulations
for
proposing
more
than
1,200
comments
considered
and
subsequent
to
consideration
of
them,
the
federal
reserve
board
promulgated
the
four
installment
rule
in
its
present
form.
that
rule
has
remained
in
effect
by
three
years
of
experience,
reflecting
the
board's
judgment
that
it
is
operative
and
effectuates
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
designed.
the
judgment
and
expertise
of
a
board,
of
an
agency
such
as
the
federal
reserve
board
intimately
involved
with
the
framing
of
the
statute
and
charged
with
responsibility
of
setting
its
machinery
in
motion
and
of
making
the
parts
work
efficiently
and
smoothly
while
they
are
yet
new
and
untried,
that
was
entirely
great
difference.
a
issue
in
this
case
is
not
an
ancillary
regulation
of
minor
significance
but
a
rule
which
the
federal
reserve
board
has
found
vital
to
preventing
wholesale
evasion
of
the
act.
if
the
federal
reserve
board's,
four
installment
rule
is
invalidated,
large
numbers
of
creditors
currently
bearing
their
finance
charges
will
be
able
to
refuse,
disclose,
both
their
prices
and
all
the
other
credit
terms
of
their
transactions.
the
board
has
further
projected
that
the
number
of
creditors
thus
hiding
their
finance
charges
will
increase
as
a
result
of
the
promulgation
of
the
statute
and
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
will
thus
be
to
decrease,
rather
than
increase,
the
amount
of
information
which
consumers
get.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
in
the
case
of
the
burden
of
this,
decrease
in
disclosure
will
fall
particularly,
heavily
upon
the
poor.
in
sharp
contrast
to
these
consequence,
creditors
such
as
family
publication
service
will
suffer
no
serious
inconvenience
if
they
are
required
to
make
disclosures
and
comply
with
the
four
installment
rule.
fps's
most
retailers
uses
a
printed
form
contract
and
standardized
terms
there
in
and
virtually
all
of
the
missing
information
and
all
of
the
missing
standardized
terminology
in
this
case,
could
have
been
included
on
that
form
when
it
was
printed.
the
only
interest
which
fps
could
have
had
in
withholding
the
absent
information
from
mrs.
mourning
was
to
lure
her
into
making
an
uninformed
decision,
to
sign
a
contracts
at
issue
and
it
was
precisely
to
prevent
this
kind
of
uninformed
purchases
that
the
truth
in
lending
act
was
enacted
by
congress.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
apparently
not,
the
letters
sent
to
mrs.
mourning
indicated
that
fps
had
in
fact
taped
with
the
magazines
to
some
extent
in
advance.
so
one
letter
suggested
they
had
fully
invested
her
contract,
which
suggested
that
they
had
paid
for
the
things
completely.
the
letters
indicated
the
very
least
that
they
had
prepaid
publishers
to
some
extent
from
their
own
funds
and
that
she
owed
them
money
to
repay
them
and
the
word
'repay'
is
used
in
the
letters
for
what
expenditures
they
already
made.
now,
if
for
example
she
had
doubled
the
bank,
borrowed
$122
and
paid
it
to
the
magazine
companies,
it
would
still
be
the
case
that
she
was
receiving
magazines
only
after
she
had
put
out
money
to
the
bank.
but
the
fact
that
matters
that
would
clearly
be
a
credit
transaction
because
the
lender
involved
would
have
parted
with
value
not
to
her
but
to
the
magazine
company
prior
to
receive
any
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
maybe
then
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
finance
charge,
the
argument
that
i
would
suggest
wouldn’t
turn
upon
the
fact
that
she
was
--
they
were
using
her
money
but
rather
the
fact
that
she
was
using
theirs
but
essentially
she
was
getting
a
subscription
purchased
for
her
by
fps,
with
fps's
money
and
then
being
allowed
to
repay
fps
with
that
advanced
payment
over
a
period
of
two-and-half
years.
mr.
eric
schnapper
congress
has
adjoined
that
particular
bill
(inaudible)
committee.
mr.
eric
schnapper
my
understanding
is
that
that
particular
statute
would
have
put
--
that
particular
amendment
to
the
statute
would
have
put
into
the
statute
and
ruled
substantially
equivalent
to
the
four
installment
rule
that's
been
promulgated
by
the
board.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
similar
case
arose
under
jones
v.
alfred
mayer
company,
several
years
ago
in
this
court,
where
not
only
had
a
fair
housing
act
been
proposed
in
congress
but
actually
passed.
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
was
called
upon
to
decide
whether
something
similar
to
fair
housing
had
been
posed
by
statute
almost
a
century
old.
the
court
proceeded
to
reach
that
question
even
though
the
practical
matter
that
particular
problem
had
been
resolved,
that
social
problem
had
been
resolved
by
congress
in
another
statute.
in
this
case,
of
course
we
have
nothing
here
but
the
hope
that
someone
will
get
up
and
propose
that
this
particular
statute
will
be
passed
by
both
houses
signed
by
the
president.
that
particular
congress
though
it
was
elected
two
days
ago
and
hasn't
even
met
yet,
would
be
other
speculations
and
point
to
guess
what
had
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
know
no,
i
think
that
reflects
congress's
concern
with
the
fact
that
if
the
regulations
invalidate
the
whole
statute
is
threat
and
whole
statutory
scheme
maybe
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
didn't
reach
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
true
too.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
wasn’t
going
to
push
my
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
that's
correct.
we
have
termed
it
clearly
erroneous
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
adequate
evidence
to
support
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
that's
essentially
our
analysis.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yeah,
as
far
as
i
recall
this.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
and
that
was
reinforced
by
the
economic
circumstances
which
followed
the
payment
of
money
to
publisher.
mr.
eric
schnapper
my
time
is
up.
mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
first
case
to
reach
this
court
arising
out
of
one
of
the
most
important
federal
statute
for
the
protection
of
the
consumers.
the
truth
in
lending
act
of
1968.
that
statute
was
enacted
to
inform
consumers
about
the
cost
of
credit
and
about
the
other
terms
of
credit
transactions.
congress
was
particularly
concerned,
to
aid
consumers
like
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
a
75
year
old
widow
living
on
a
government
pension
of
$82.50
a
month,
who
can
ill
afford
high
finance
charges
or
excessive
financial
commitments.
defendant
admits
that
it
failed
to
make
several
disclosures
applied
by
the
regulations
of
federal
reserve
board
but
claims
that
those
regulations
are
invalid.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows.
on
august
19th,
1969
following
a
telephone
solicitation,
mrs.
mourning
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
defendant
family
publications
service
for
the
purchase
of
four
magazines.
the
contract
is
set
out
on
pages
6
and
7
of
the
printed
appendix.
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
mrs.
mourning
was
to
receive
life,
holiday,
ladies
home
journal
and
travel
and
camera
for
period
of
five
years.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
price
would
have
been.
mr.
eric
schnapper
under
the
terms
of
the
regulation
and
the
statute,
it's
not.
whether
or
not,
she
was
given
a
good
price
is
ultimately
something
that
she
under
our
economic
system
ought
to
been
able
to
determine
for
self.
one
of
the
problems
that
arises
out
of
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
disclose
the
total
price
of
the
goods
was
that
even
she
had
been
aware,
the
terms
offered
by
the
publisher
directly.
she
had
no
way
of
making
that
comparison.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
absent
the
regulation
it
would
be
necessary
to
inquire
about
the
general
practices
of
the
defendant
as
to
whether
or
not,
it
was
inflating
as
prices
--the
whole
purpose
of
the
regulation
was
to
make
that
very
detailed
and
complicated
factual
inquiry
unnecessary,
both
to
avoid
deterring
private
actions
such
as
this
one
and
to
make
sure
that
the
statute
itself
was
administrative,
otherwise
the
federal
reserve
board
and
other
enforcement
agencies
would
be
in
the
business
of
trying
to
compare
the
prices
for
other
magazines
or
bicycles
or
television
sets
with
the
prices
charged
in
contracts
like
this
for
all
the
consumer
contracts
that
are
signed
every
day
in
country.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
under
the
regulations
that
problem
is
not
the
one
that
has
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
board
or
by
plaintiffs
seeking
to
prove
that
the
information
should
have
been
disclosed.
mrs.
mourning
paid
$3.95
down
and
agreed
to
pay
$3.95
a
year
for
two-and-a-half
years.
the
contract
did
not
disclose
that
the
cost
of
magazines
was
$122.45
in
order
to
disclose
the
amount
due
after
the
down
payment
was
$118.50.
in
addition,
the
contract
did
not
disclose,
would
have
been
revealed
first
time,
the
first
time
in
this
court
by
the
defendant
that
if
mrs.
mourning
had
paid
cash
for
the
magazines,
she
might
well
have
paid
less
to
the
defendant
itself.
all
of
this
information
withheld
from
mrs.
mourning
by
the
defendant.
it
was
required
to
be
disclosed
two
consumers
in
credit
transactions
covered
by
the
truth
in
lending
act.
mrs.
mourning
refused
to
make
any
payments
under
the
contract
after
the
initial
down
payments.
on
december
of
16th,
1969
defendant
sent
mrs.
mourning
at
first
of
at
least
8
dunning
letters,
all
of
which
are
set
out
on
pages
14-21
of
the
printed
appendix.
the
first
letter
stated
that
fps
had
had
mrs.
mourning's
subscriptions
entered
for
the
entire
five
year
period
and
her
contract
could
not
be
canceled.
on
december
28th
of
that
year
fps
sent
mrs.
mourning
a
second
letter
stating
that
fps
had
paid
for
the
magazines
in
advance
and
that
mrs.
mourning
had
incurred
an
obligation
to
repay
fps.
the
letter
also
stated,
this
is
a
credit
account
and
as
such
must
be
repaid
by
you
on
a
monthly
basis
much
the
same
as
if
you
had
purchased
any
other
type
of
monthly,
any
other
type
of
merchandise
on
a
monthly
budget
plan.
on
april
23rd,
1970
mrs.
mourning
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida
suing
to
enforce
the
truth
in
lending
act,
federal
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
statute
expressly
conferred
upon
district
courts
by
section
1640
of
the
statute.
mrs.
mourning
in
her
amended
complaint
alleged
that
the
contract
with
fps
was
a
credit
transaction
covered
by
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
that
the
disclosures
required
by
the
act
had
not
been
made.
plaintiffs
sought
statutory
damage
of
$100
plus
legal
fees
and
cost.
fps
in
its
answer
asserted
three
defenses
relevant
here.
fps
urged
first
that
none
of
the
disclosure
provision
of
the
act
applied
to
this
transaction
because
the
contract
did
not
involve
the
finance
charge.
as
a
second
defense
fps
asserted
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
the
contract
because
fps
had
not
extended
credit
to
mrs.
mourning.
finally,
fps
maintained
that
even
if
the
contract
were
covered
by
the
act,
neither
mrs.
mourning
or
any
other
consumer
could
enforce
the
statute
because
fps
had
not
imposed
to
finance
charge
under
this
type
of

fps
concedes
however
that
it
did
not
make
the
disclosures
which
plaintiff
claims
are
legally
required.
on
october
30th,
1970
the
district
court
granted
mrs.
mourning's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that
court
ruled
that
the
transaction
was
subject
to
the
truth
in
lending
disclosure
requirements
because
the
purchase
price
was
payable
in
more
than
four
installments.
the
district
court
upheld
and
applied
the
four
installments
promulgated
by
the
federal
reserve
board
which
requires
that
disclosures
be
made
to
consumers
in
any
transaction
involving
more
than
four
installments
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
finance
charge
is
proved
and
would
have
been
imposed.
the
district
court
also
held
that
the
instant
contract
involved
the
extension
of
credit
by
fps
to
mrs.
mourning.
judgment
was
entered
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
the
amount
of
$100
plus
cost
and
attorney's
fees.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
appeal
and
order
the
complaint
dismissed.
in
an
opinion
by
judge
coleman,
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
four
installment
rule
required
fps
to
make
the
disclosures
withheld
in
this
case.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
rule
was
invalid
because
it
was
not
within
the
federal
reserve
board's
power
to
promulgate
regulations
under
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
four
installment
rule
was
unconstitutional
because
it
constituted
conclusive
presumptions
that
all
transactions
with
more
than
four
installments
involved
a
hidden
finance
charge.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
under
two
additional
defenses
raised
by
fps
and
the
district
court.
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
sought
in
this
court
to
review
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
validating
the
four
installment
rule.
fps
did
not
urged
in
the
proceedings
below
that
the
four
installment
rule
was
unconstitutional
and
expressly
does
not
rely
on
that
ground
before
this
court.
fps
does
argue
however,
that
four
installment
regulation
exceeded
the
board's
rule
making
authority
under
the
truth
in
lending
act.
statute
involved
was
enacted
in
1968
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
giving
to
consumers
a
meaningful
disclosure
of
credit
terms
so
that
the
consumer
would
be
able
to
compare
more
readily
the
various
credit
terms
available
to
him
and
to
avoid
the
uninformed
use
of
credit.
the
statute
arose
out
of
seven
years
of
hearings
and
committee
findings
that
consumers
were
generally,
unaware
of
the
terms
of
their
loans,
contracts
and
other
credit
transactions.
the
legislative
history
revealed
that
creditors
generally
withheld
vital
information
and
that
the
value
of
what
was
disclosed,
was
often
impaired
by
widely
disparate
terminology
and
accounting
methods.
in
addition
to
express
the
stated
purpose
quoted
contained
in
section
1601
of
the
act.
section
1604
of
the
statute
specifically
authorized
that
federal
reserve
board
to
promulgate
whatever
regulations
it
might
deem
necessary
or
proper
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
delegating
this
general
regulatory
responsibility
to
the
board,
congress
also
enacted
a
number
of
specific
provisions
requiring
several
disclosures
under
various
circumstances.
these
disclosures
include
price
of
the
goods,
the
amount
to
be
paid
after
the
down
payment,
the
finance
charge
involve
and
your
annual
interest
rate
of
finance
charge
expressed
as
a
percentage.
the
statute
and
regulations
also
require
the
standardized
terminology
be
used
to
facilitate
comparison
of
various
contract.
some
of
the
problems
as
to
how
the
purpose
of
meaningful
disclosure
would
be
achieved
and
dealt
with
detail
by
congress
in
these
substantive
provisions.
other
problems
were
left
untreated
for
resolution
by
the
board
itself.
congress
provided
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
regulations
will
be
left
primarily
to
private
parties
suing
such
as
mrs.
mourning
and
also
mandated
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
regulations
by
various
federal
agencies.
the
four
installment
rule
whose
validity
is
at
issue.
it's
contained
in
12
cfr
section
226.2(k)
and
it's
set
on
page
4
on
petitioners
brief.
the
effect
of
the
rule
is
to
require
disclosures
be
made
two
consumers,
in
any
credit
transactions
payable
on
more
than
for
installments,
regardless
of
whether
the
creditor
admits
to
imposing
a
finance
charge
in
that
transactions
or
others.
in
the
instant
case,
the
four
installment
rule
would
have
required
in
a
minimum
that
fps
disclosed
to
mrs.
mourning
that
total
price
of
the
magazines
and
the
amount
which
she
still
owed
fps
after
her
initial
down
payment.
mr.
eric
schnapper
$20.45.
whether
the
federal
reserve
board's
four
installment
rule
is
a
valid,
it
turns
upon
whether
it
was
within
the
board's
expressed
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
as
set
out
in
the
truth
in
lending
act
itself.
the
authority
of
the
board
is
defined
in
section
1604
of
the
statute
reproduced
on
pages
3
and
4
of
petitioner's
brief.
that
section
provides,
the
board
shall
prescribe
regulations
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
this
sub
chapter.
these
regulations
may
contain
such
classifications,
differentiations
or
other
provisions
and
may
provide
for
such
adjustments
or
exceptions
for
any
class
of
transactions
as
in
a
judgment
of
the
board
are
necessary
or
proper
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
this
sub-chapter
to
prevent
circumvention
or
evasion
thereof
or
to
facilitate
compliance
there
with.
the
four
installment
rule
is
necessary
first
to
prevent
evasion
of
the
substantive
requirement
contained
in
section
1638
of
the
act.
the
creditors
disclosed
to
consumers,
the
finance
charge
in
annual
interest
rate
imposed
in
any
credit
transaction.
in
the
normal
credit
sale
with
which
we
are
familiar,
the
merchant
imposes
one
charge
for
the
purchase
of
goods
for
cash
and
imposes
an
additional
separate
charge
for
the
privilege
of
paying
for
the
goods
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
congress
was
particularly
concerned
however,
that
the
amount
of
this
finance
charge
might
be
hidden
in
the
price
of
the
goods
themselves.
the
board
included
that
such
a
danger
was
very
real.
their
concern
was
for
example,
that
instead
of
charging
a
$100
for
television
set
and
$20
for
privilege
paying
for
over
two
years,
the
merchant
will
charge
$120
for
the
television
set
and
inform
the
consumer
that
the
credit
was
free.
such
a
merchant
would
naturally
assert
that
the
annual
interest
rate
involved
was
zero.
this
would
not
merely
leave
consumers
uninformed,
but
would
create
a
false
illusion
at
the
merchant's
credit
with
significantly
less
expensive
than
the
credit
of
lenders
such
as
banks
which
had
no
prices
in
which
they
could
vary
their
finance
charges.
the
congressional
hearings
indicated
that
varying
finance
charges
and
prices
was
a
problem
even
before
the
statute
was
enacted.
and
the
report
to
congress
by
the
federal
trade
commission
indicated
that
this
practice
of
hiring
finance
charges
and
prices
was
particularly
common
in
urban
ghettos.
rather
than
permit
retailers
to
thus
render
the
truth
in
lending
acts
requirement
of
disclosure
finance
charge
is
a
dead
letter.
the
federal
reserve
board
promulgated
the
four
installment
rule.
a
key
effect
of
this
rule
is
to
require
a
creditor
who
may
claim,
he
imposes
no
finance
charges
to
nonetheless
disclose
at
the
very
least,
the
total
price
of
the
goods
involved
in
any
transaction,
payable
within
four
installments.
the
board
apparently
reasoned
as
had
the
supporters
of
the
statute
while
it
was
being
considered
by
congress.
that
if
consumers
were
at
least
told
the
total
price
of
an
item,
they
could
compare
that
price
with
other
prices
and
determine
if
a
merchant
were
charging
more
than
the
normal
amount.
in
this
case
for
example
if
mrs.
mourning
had
been
told
the
total
prices
of
a
magazine,
it
was
a
$122.45.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
the
board
concluded--
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
regulation
is
designed
not
merely
to
facilitate
or
encourage
that
kind
of
case
by
case
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
was
a
hidden
finance
charge.
the
congressional
hearings
indicated
that
congress
felt
that
it
was
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
the
statute
stood
alone,
an
inquiry
would
be
necessary
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
creditor
regularly
extended
credit
for
which
the
finance
charge
was
required
and
that
would
be
the
case
because
section
1602
of
the
act
defining
creditor,
limits
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act
to
creditors
who
extend
credit
for
which
finance
charge
is
regularly
imposed.
however
–
mr.
eric
schnapper
only,
only
under
one
circumstance,
the
statute
provides--
mr.
eric
schnapper
because
–-
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
the
regulation
requires
there
be
an
extension
of
credit.
now,
the
statute
provides
that
certain
leases
will
be
treated
as
credit
sales.
i
mean
leases
which
provide
that
at
the
end
of
the
lease,
the
goods
were,
i
suppose
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that's
an
issue
that
has
been
raised
in
addition,
but
the
problem
you
raised
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
issue
is
here.
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
defendants
brought
it
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
there's
an
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it's
our
position
that
if
this
court
rules
that
the
four
installment
rule
is
invalid
and
feels
that
their
arguments
merit
detailed
consideration,
that
that
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit,
because
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
reach,
the
question
of
whether
credit
was
present
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
essential,
that's
essentially
correct.
there
are
some
conflicts
between
the
answer
and
the
evidence
as
presented
by
plaintiff
but
there
was
no
substantive
evidence
presented
by
the
defendant
for
example,
to
show
that
the
defendant
hadn't
in
fact
prepaid
publishers
to
some
extent
for
these
magazines.
and
other
facts
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
are
relevant,
clear
showing
that
credit
was
extended
in
this
case.
but
to
get
back
very
briefly
to
the
question
that
you
raised,
normal
lease,
for
example,
the
apartment
would
not
be
covered
by
the
statute
because
of
the
end
of
at
lease
the
apartment
revert
to
the
owner
of
the
building.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
wouldn't
be
any
credit.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that’s
correct
but
more
importantly
the
statute
distinguishes
those
kinds
of
cases
from
a
lease
in
which
at
the
end
of
the
lease
period,
the
property
goes
over
to
the
tenant
or
to
the
person
who's
renting
materials.
if,
for
example,
you
rent
a
television
for
$10
a
week
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
you
can
buy
it
for
a
nickel.
that's
treated
as
a
sale
under
the
act.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
would
be
a
separate
question
to
be
resolved,
but
in
the
case
of
a
television
set
of
course,
it
would
be
clear
that
the
reported
tenant,
lessee
of
the
goods
in
fact
had
a
possession
from
the
beginning.
in
these
cases,
as
the
evidence
shows,
the
facts
are
not
such
as
i
think
you
may
have
in
mind,
a
problem
where
the
goods
are
only
delivered
after
they
are
paid.
the
contract
in
fact,
involves
three
parties,
mrs.
mourning
who
bought
the
goods,
family
publication
service
and
the
publishers
which
was
a
different,
i
don't
know,
we
don't
know
exactly
how
many
publishers
there
were
involved.
now
the
letter,
the
dunning
letters
which
were
sent
to
mrs.
mourning
show
that,
first,
there
were
these
additional
parties
and
fps
was
not
in
fact
the
seller
or
a
publisher
of
the
magazines.
secondly,
that
assumes
the
right
roughly
after
the
contract
was
signed.
fps
turned
around
and
contracted
with
publishers
in
advance
to
deliver
all
the
magazines
to
mrs.
mourning
over
the
requisite
period.
third,
fps
stated
in
these
letters
and
the
evidence
wasn’t
contradicted
below
that
he
had
prepaid
to
some
extent
the
cost
of
the
magazines
and
they
told
mrs.
mourning
in
several
cases
that
she
owed
them
money
because
they
couldn't
get
a
refund
from
the
publishers.
now
there's
–
normally
it’s
not
the
simple
case
of
a
person
selling
a
television
set,
where
you
in
fact
that
have
three
parties,
but
as
fps
stated
in
one
of
the
letters
involved,
it
acted
as
really
as
a
financier
of
this
whole
operation.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
we
believe
not
because
under
the
realities
of
transaction
where
she
paid
for
magazines
before
she
got
them.
she
paid
for
them
after
fps
had
paid
out
money
to
the
publishers
so
that
she
had
a
debt
to
fps
to
cover
the
money
that
they
had
laid
out.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that’s
also
correct.
that's
the
normal
practice.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
our
economic
analysis
would
be
essentially
that
they
put
up
the
money
for
her
to
buy
the
subscription
and
she
paid
them
back.
now
the
record
doesn't
indicate
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
we
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
under
the
regulation,
that's
correct.
the
four
installment
rule
is
also
necessary
to
prevent
evasion
of
the
other
disclosure
requirements
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
requiring
disclosure
of
finance
charges,
the
statute
requires
the
disclosure
of
a
host
of
other
credit
terms,
the
amount
financed
and
the
price
of
the
goods,
time
and
number
of
payments.
if
however,
a
creditor
asserts
in
his
contract
that
he
does
not
impose
the
finance
charge,
a
serious
question
arises
under
the
face
of
the
statute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
creditor
need
to
disclose
anything
to
consumer
whether
by
having
first
hidden
his
finance
charge,
and
evaded
the
requirement
that
that
to
be
disclosed.
he
can
then
turn
around
and
evade
all
the
other
requirements
of
the
statute
and
claim
a
complete
exemption.
the
four
installment
rule
precludes
this
type
of
circumvention
as
well.
the
regulation
provides
that
the
usual
disclosures
must
be
made
in
any
transaction
involving
finance
charges
but
also
in
any
transaction
in
which
more
than
four
installments
are
involved.
the
rule
does
not
only
prevent
circumvention
of
the
act
in
this
way,
but
effectuates
the
expressly
stated
purpose
of
the
act
to
provide
consumers
with
credit
terms
of
their
transactions.
congress
expressly
delegated
to
the
federal
reserve
board
responsibility
for
deciding
when
it
was
a
danger
evasion
and
profession
and
remedies
to
be
involved
to
deal
with
that
danger.
the
board's
expertise
in
understanding
the
statute
goes
back
to
many
years
before
its
actual
enactment
because
the
board
was
intimately
involved
in
the
process
of
drafting
the
statute
through
the
congressional
hearings.
after
the
statute
put
draft
regulations
for
proposing
more
than
1,200
comments
considered
and
subsequent
to
consideration
of
them,
the
federal
reserve
board
promulgated
the
four
installment
rule
in
its
present
form.
that
rule
has
remained
in
effect
by
three
years
of
experience,
reflecting
the
board's
judgment
that
it
is
operative
and
effectuates
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
designed.
the
judgment
and
expertise
of
a
board,
of
an
agency
such
as
the
federal
reserve
board
intimately
involved
with
the
framing
of
the
statute
and
charged
with
responsibility
of
setting
its
machinery
in
motion
and
of
making
the
parts
work
efficiently
and
smoothly
while
they
are
yet
new
and
untried,
that
was
entirely
great
difference.
a
issue
in
this
case
is
not
an
ancillary
regulation
of
minor
significance
but
a
rule
which
the
federal
reserve
board
has
found
vital
to
preventing
wholesale
evasion
of
the
act.
if
the
federal
reserve
board's,
four
installment
rule
is
invalidated,
large
numbers
of
creditors
currently
bearing
their
finance
charges
will
be
able
to
refuse,
disclose,
both
their
prices
and
all
the
other
credit
terms
of
their
transactions.
the
board
has
further
projected
that
the
number
of
creditors
thus
hiding
their
finance
charges
will
increase
as
a
result
of
the
promulgation
of
the
statute
and
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
will
thus
be
to
decrease,
rather
than
increase,
the
amount
of
information
which
consumers
get.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
in
the
case
of
the
burden
of
this,
decrease
in
disclosure
will
fall
particularly,
heavily
upon
the
poor.
in
sharp
contrast
to
these
consequence,
creditors
such
as
family
publication
service
will
suffer
no
serious
inconvenience
if
they
are
required
to
make
disclosures
and
comply
with
the
four
installment
rule.
fps's
most
retailers
uses
a
printed
form
contract
and
standardized
terms
there
in
and
virtually
all
of
the
missing
information
and
all
of
the
missing
standardized
terminology
in
this
case,
could
have
been
included
on
that
form
when
it
was
printed.
the
only
interest
which
fps
could
have
had
in
withholding
the
absent
information
from
mrs.
mourning
was
to
lure
her
into
making
an
uninformed
decision,
to
sign
a
contracts
at
issue
and
it
was
precisely
to
prevent
this
kind
of
uninformed
purchases
that
the
truth
in
lending
act
was
enacted
by
congress.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
apparently
not,
the
letters
sent
to
mrs.
mourning
indicated
that
fps
had
in
fact
taped
with
the
magazines
to
some
extent
in
advance.
so
one
letter
suggested
they
had
fully
invested
her
contract,
which
suggested
that
they
had
paid
for
the
things
completely.
the
letters
indicated
the
very
least
that
they
had
prepaid
publishers
to
some
extent
from
their
own
funds
and
that
she
owed
them
money
to
repay
them
and
the
word
'repay'
is
used
in
the
letters
for
what
expenditures
they
already
made.
now,
if
for
example
she
had
doubled
the
bank,
borrowed
$122
and
paid
it
to
the
magazine
companies,
it
would
still
be
the
case
that
she
was
receiving
magazines
only
after
she
had
put
out
money
to
the
bank.
but
the
fact
that
matters
that
would
clearly
be
a
credit
transaction
because
the
lender
involved
would
have
parted
with
value
not
to
her
but
to
the
magazine
company
prior
to
receive
any
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
maybe
then
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
finance
charge,
the
argument
that
i
would
suggest
wouldn’t
turn
upon
the
fact
that
she
was
--
they
were
using
her
money
but
rather
the
fact
that
she
was
using
theirs
but
essentially
she
was
getting
a
subscription
purchased
for
her
by
fps,
with
fps's
money
and
then
being
allowed
to
repay
fps
with
that
advanced
payment
over
a
period
of
two-and-half
years.
mr.
eric
schnapper
congress
has
adjoined
that
particular
bill
(inaudible)
committee.
mr.
eric
schnapper
my
understanding
is
that
that
particular
statute
would
have
put
--
that
particular
amendment
to
the
statute
would
have
put
into
the
statute
and
ruled
substantially
equivalent
to
the
four
installment
rule
that's
been
promulgated
by
the
board.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
similar
case
arose
under
jones
v.
alfred
mayer
company,
several
years
ago
in
this
court,
where
not
only
had
a
fair
housing
act
been
proposed
in
congress
but
actually
passed.
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
was
called
upon
to
decide
whether
something
similar
to
fair
housing
had
been
posed
by
statute
almost
a
century
old.
the
court
proceeded
to
reach
that
question
even
though
the
practical
matter
that
particular
problem
had
been
resolved,
that
social
problem
had
been
resolved
by
congress
in
another
statute.
in
this
case,
of
course
we
have
nothing
here
but
the
hope
that
someone
will
get
up
and
propose
that
this
particular
statute
will
be
passed
by
both
houses
signed
by
the
president.
that
particular
congress
though
it
was
elected
two
days
ago
and
hasn't
even
met
yet,
would
be
other
speculations
and
point
to
guess
what
had
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
know
no,
i
think
that
reflects
congress's
concern
with
the
fact
that
if
the
regulations
invalidate
the
whole
statute
is
threat
and
whole
statutory
scheme
maybe
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
didn't
reach
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
true
too.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
wasn’t
going
to
push
my
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
that's
correct.
we
have
termed
it
clearly
erroneous
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
adequate
evidence
to
support
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
that's
essentially
our
analysis.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yeah,
as
far
as
i
recall
this.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
and
that
was
reinforced
by
the
economic
circumstances
which
followed
the
payment
of
money
to
publisher.
mr.
eric
schnapper
my
time
is
up.
