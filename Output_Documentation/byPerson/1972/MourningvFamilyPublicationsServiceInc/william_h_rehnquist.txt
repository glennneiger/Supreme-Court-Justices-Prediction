mr.
randolph,
are
you
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
is
a
statutory
finance
charge
every
time
the
sale
is
not
for
cash?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
your
analysis
is
correct
that
every
time
you
do
not
sale
for
cash
there
are
hidden
costs
whether
you
admitted
or
not,
whether
you
know
of
them
or
not.
why
would
not
the
same
be
true
for
a
two
installment?

it
