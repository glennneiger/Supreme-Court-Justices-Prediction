justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
randolph
as
i
understand
the
court
below,
they
said
that
congress
couldn't
adapt
this
regulation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
court
below
just
said,
the
act
was
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
by
everything
you
say
up
to
the
point
as
a
fact
that
once
she
misses
one
payment,
she
is
trouble.
for
example,
if
you
only
pay
$3
a
month
or
three,
$1
book,
that
might
not
be
credit.
but
if
the
contract
provides
that
you
must
do
that
for
three
years
and
failure
to
make
one
installment
accelerate,
isn't
that
an
entirely
different
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
when
they
pay
their
whole
amount,
if
they
had
a
credit
relationship
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
in
the
original
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
isn't
that
a
contract
of
credit,
since
it's
in
the
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
didn't
agree
for
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
ago
was
that
somebody
mowed
a
lawn
for
a
dollar?
