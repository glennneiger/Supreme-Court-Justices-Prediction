justice
potter
stewart
she
made
additional
down
payment
of
$3.95,
did
she?
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
that
extent
she
was
the
creditor,
doesn’t
she?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
to
that
extent,
i
mean
and
the
whole
deal
was
that
she
should
be
the
one
who
extended
the
credit,
she
paid
in
advance
for
getting
anything
and
always
under
the
contract,
she
would
have
always
paid
more
than
she
got.
and
that's
both
by
the
under
the
statute
and
by
ordinary
economic
and
dictionary
definitional
terms,
she
was
the
one
that
was
the
creditor,
wouldn't
she?
justice
potter
stewart
she
couldn’t
get
the
magazines
from
the
publisher
except
by
paying
before
the
full
subscription
charges.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
middle
man
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
with
the
finance
charges?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
schnapper
let
me
try
to
straighten
myself.
i
understand
your
position
on
your
relevancy
and
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
finance
charge,
am
i
correct
on
the
facts
that
if
this
contract
had
been
carried
out
from
the
start
according
to
its
terms,
mrs.
mourning
would
always
be
ahead
in
the
sense
that
she
at
any
point
would
have
paid
more
than
she
had
received
in
return
for
that
payment
because
her
payments
were
over
30
months
and
the
subscription
is
over
60.
am
i
correct
in
this?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
possible
to
say
then
that
fps
would
have
the
use
of
that
money
throughout
the
period?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
i
am
trying
to
suggest
is
to
ask
whether
there
is
a
finances
charge
in
fps's
use
of
her
money
and
i
take
it
that
you
are
saying
there
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
lastly,
am
i
correct,
in
my
impression
that
there
is
some
pending
1972
legislation
in
the
subject?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
would
that
bill
have
done?
i
didn't
find
it
mentioned
in
either
brief
and
do
you
know
what
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
existence
of
that
proposed
legislation
weaken
your
argument
in
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
don’t
--
you
were
more
accurate
at
the
first
time
they
didn't
reach
it.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
you
suggest
that
the
analysis
should
be
that
if
john
smith
wants
to
subscribe
to
life
magazine
and
borrows
$25
from
a
bank
and
prepays
this
to
get
a
five-years
subscription
to
life
magazine,
he
is
a
debtor
and
a
bank
is
a
creditor,
visa-v
that
$25,
even
though
he
maybe
a
creditor
and
the
publisher
of
life
magazine,
a
debtor,
visa-v
has
prepayment
of
a
five-year
subscription?
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
really
make
a
--
does
that
really
bear
on
the
issue
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that;
that
may
go
to
the
motivation
of
board
and
the
rationality
of
the
board,
but
i
thought
that
whether
in
particular
case
there
was
a
hidden
finance
charge,
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
issue
that
this
was
a
general
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
there
were
no
hidden
or
finance
charge
here
of
any
kind?
justice
potter
stewart
nevertheless
if
the
regulations
are
fully
require
the
disclosure
of
certain
information,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
not
very
likely?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
right
in
your
position
exactly
what
would
have
had
been
disclosed
here.
i
can't
find
out
i
saw
it
in
the
agreement
but
the
total
price
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
31
times
395?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no
total
is
the
down-payment
of
395
was
31
times
395.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
they
would
have
to
do
that
modification,
30
times
395.
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
now
know
that
it
is,
that
it
was
lowered.
justice
potter
stewart
simply
31
times
395.
justice
potter
stewart
just
fourth
grade
arithmetic,
they
would
have
to
note
down.
justice
potter
stewart
now
these
are
the
requirements
you
specified
where
in
which
part
of
the
legislation
are
they?
i
can't
find
them.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
ones
you
just
did
in
going
down
this
contract
on
page
6
to
7,
if
you
said
what
they
would
have
been
require
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
in
these
papers
over
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
advisory
he
doesn't
rely
on
that
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
in
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
seller
himself
might
not
realize
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
the
price?
justice
potter
stewart
the
cost
is
to
the
extender
of
the
credit,
and
the
price
is
to
the
extendee
of
the
credit.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
matter
of
economic
reality
however
it
does
--
i
mean
$2,000
over
20
weeks
is
less
money
than
$2,000
cash
on
hand.
everybody
who
has
ever
studied
elementary
economics
knows
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart
which
he
may
or
may
not
even
realize.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
as
just
as
they
are
not
even
buyers
they
are
not
even
sellers,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
regulation
is
valid,
it
is
1638,
it
is
the
information
required
by
1638
that
would
be
applicable
to
this
transaction.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
found
mr.
rifkind
that
it
was
now
at
least
declared
relatively
that,
that
had
it
been
an
entire
cash
transaction,
it
would
have
been
a
lower
amount
of
total
cash?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
was
in
the
briefs
stated
--
justice
potter
stewart
family
publication
service
would
have
done
it
and
7,
subsection
7
of
1638(a),
subsection
6,
i
mean,
says
that
the
finance
charge
maybe
designated
as
a
time
price
differential
so
to
that
extent,
it
would
not
be
an
impossible
or
unrealistic
requirement.
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
if
i
misunderstood
that--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
--
it
is
also
clear
that
there
was
an
extension
of
credit?
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
did
that
the
district
court
say?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
district
court
say
that
the
defendant
has
extended
consumer
credit
within
the
meaning
of
the
truth
in
landing
act?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
finding
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
he
decided
--
he
concludes,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
tried
out.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it
was
on
affidavits,
wasn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
were
matters
besides
the
pleadings
taken
into
account.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
answer
is
yes
then.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
there
was
--
and
the
court
did
enter
a
summary
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
course
of
that,
he
said
that.
justice
potter
stewart
now
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
anything
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of,
there
wasn't
that
credit
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
the
regulations
certainly
doesn't
make
any
relevant
whether
it
was
a
credit
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
with
respect
to
the
finance
charge.
justice
potter
stewart
the
regulations
doesn't
seem
to.
justice
potter
stewart
but
maybe
not
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
an
objection
to
deciding
the
case
on
summary
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wasn’t
one
of
the
relevant
question
in
the
case
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
credit
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
that
that
was
a
really
a
legal
question
on
which
you
really
couldn’t
find
anymore
facts
other
than
the
contract
and
the
letters
may
be?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
have
it
been
rather
relevant
on
that
question
to
know
what
the
rearrangements
were
between
family
publications
and
the
publishers?
justice
potter
stewart
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
they
actually
had
paid
the
publishers,
a
sum
of
money
on
behalf
of
the
customer.
justice
potter
stewart
well
isn't
that
strange
for
the
court
to
figure
that
it
must
invalidate
the
regulation
unless
it
assumes
that
the
fact
that
triggers
the
regulation
is
it
present
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
in
major
litigation
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
got
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
not
an
agent;
you
are
not
an
agent.
justice
potter
stewart
she
made
additional
down
payment
of
$3.95,
did
she?
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
that
extent
she
was
the
creditor,
doesn’t
she?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
to
that
extent,
i
mean
and
the
whole
deal
was
that
she
should
be
the
one
who
extended
the
credit,
she
paid

justice

stewart
she
couldn’t

the

justice
potter
stewart
and
a

(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was

the

charges?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.

let
me

i

enter
a
summary
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
course
of
that,
he
said
that.
justice
potter
stewart
now
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
anything
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of,
there
wasn't
that
credit
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
the
regulations
certainly
doesn't
make
any
relevant
whether
it
was
a
credit
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
with
respect
to
the
finance
charge.
justice
potter
stewart
the
regulations
doesn't
seem
to.
justice
potter
stewart
but
maybe
not
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
an
objection
to
deciding
the
case
on
summary
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wasn’t
one
of
the
relevant
question
in
the
case
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
credit
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
that
that
was
a
really
a
legal
question
on
which
you
really
couldn’t
find
anymore
facts
other
than
the
contract
and
the
letters
may
be?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
have
it
been
rather
relevant
on
that
question
to
know
what
the
rearrangements
were
between
family
publications
and
the
publishers?
justice
potter
stewart
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
they
actually
had
paid
the
publishers,
a
sum
of
money
on
behalf
of
the
customer.
justice
potter
stewart
well
isn't
that
strange
for
the
court
to
figure
that
it
must
invalidate
the
regulation
unless
it
assumes
that
the
fact
that
triggers
the
regulation
is
it
present
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
in
major
litigation
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
got
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
not
an
agent;
you
are
not
an
agent.
