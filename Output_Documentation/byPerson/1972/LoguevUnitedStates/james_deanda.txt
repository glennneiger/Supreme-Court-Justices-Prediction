mr.
james
deanda
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
arising
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
resulting
from
the
suicidal
death
of
a
federal
prisoner
confined
in
a
state
facility.
the
district
court,
in
this
instance,
found
both
the
marshal
and
the
sheriff,
the
state
official
involved,
negligent.
it
found
the
marshal
negligent
in
not
making
arrangements
for
a
constant
surveillance
of
the
deceased
and
found
the
sheriff
negligent
for
making
inadequate--
for
having
inadequate
surveillance
procedures.
the
circuit
court
approved
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
but
held
that,
insofar
as
the
marshal’s
negligence
was
concerned,
that
the
marshal
had
no
authority
to
control
jail
functions
and,
therefore,
no
duty
of
safekeeping
of
the
prisoner
and
that,
insofar
as
the
sheriff
is
concerned,
that
he
was
an
independent
contractor
as
defined
under
the
tort
claims
act
and,
therefore,
the
government
had
no
liability
for
his
conduct
which
brings
us
to
the
issue
in
the
case
which
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
can
exempt
itself
from
liability
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
a
negligent
injury
to
a
prisoner
by
simply
turning
him
over
to
a
local
jail.
this
is
extremely
important
because
if
this
were
the
law,
first
of
all,
you
would
have
two
standards
insofar
as
the--
as
persons
in
detainment
are
concerned,
that
is
federal
prisoners
in
non-federal
institutions,
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
tort
claims
act
remedies,
nor
will
they
have
the
rights
of
the
protection
afforded
by
the--
by
section
4042
and
4086
which
requires
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
safely
keep
the
prisoner
and
require
the
us
marshal
to
safely
keep
his
prisoners.
it
would
also
result
in
a
situation
where,
actually,
a--
where,
in
the
usual
case
where
a
man
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
is
confined
in
a
federal
institution
has
really
more
rights
than
one
who
is
simply
charged
with
a
crime
that
has
not
yet
been
tried
because,
i
believe
as
statistic
shows
that
are
in
the
record
in
this
case,
the
persons
that
are
confined
in
state
institutions
for
the
most
part
are
persons
who
have
not
yet
been
convicted
of
crime.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
the
record
was
that
there
were
approximately
4,000
federal
prisoners
in
one
day
that
are
confined
in
state
institutions
of
various
types
and,
for
the
most
part,
awaiting
trial
on
different
offenses.
the
dissenting--
there
was
a
motion
filed
in
a
hearing
involved
before
the
circuit
which
was
denied
by
the
circuit,
but
there
was
a
dissent
filed
in
that
matter,
and
the
basis
of
the
dissent
was
that
the
breach
of
the
statutory
duty
on
the
part
of
the
marshal
occurred
when
the
prisoner
was
confined
in
the
jail
under
circumstances
that
the
marshal
knew
were
dangerous
and
without
taking
specific
precautions.
in
other
words,
the
dissent
stated
that,
really,
whether
or
not
the--
that
this
contract
between
the
government
and
the
nueces
county
jail
was
really
irrelevant
and
that
the
marshal
himself
was
guilty
of
acts
of
negligence
in
taking
this
man
and
turning
him
over
to
the
sheriff
of
nueces
county
without
making
assurances
that
he
would
be
cared
for,
knowing
the
very
peculiar
and
special
circumstances
that
surrounded
the
case.
mr.
james
deanda
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe--
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
negligence
would
be
in
selecting
the
contractor.
the
negligence
would
be
in,
and
the
negligence
that
the
court
found
was
in
not
making
arrangements
for
the
man
to
be--
the
arrangements
that
were
necessary
under
the
record
to
keep
the
man
safely
that
is,
the
marital,
for
example,
even
though
he
took
the
man
to
jail
could
have,
just
as
they
had
a
guard
for
him
at
the
hospital
after
his
first
suicidal
effort
could
have
gotten
a
guard
for
him
to
watching
and
maintain
constant
observation
while
the
man
was
in
jail
and
the--
although
the
government
places
a
great
deal
of
weight
on
the
inability
of
the
marshal
to
control
the
things
in
the
jail.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
everything
that
occurred
in
that
jail
when
this
man
was
returned
was
done
so
with
the
blessings
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
marshal.
everything
that
the
jailer
did,
the
type
of
cell
that
the
man
was
putting
him
was
all
done
because
the
marshal
wanted
it
done
that
way,
and
the
contract
with
the--
between
the
government
and
the
jail
permits
this.
the--
there’s
a
real
question
in
my
mind
that
there’s
anything
approaching
an
independent
contractor
situation
here
in
a
situation
of
this
type
because
the
regulations
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
as
shown
in
the
transcript,
really
live
it
up
to
the
marshal
when
a
particular
unusual
situation
occurs,
specifically
either
a
medical
situation
or
one
involving
custodial
problems.
that’s
not
the
not
the
run
and
the
mill
case
where
the
sheriff
is
just
simply
babysitting
with
somebody
that’s
in
jail
and
charged
with
a
crime,
that
he
is
to
call
the
marshal
and
find
out
what
the
marshal
wants
done
with
the
man
and
how
he
wants
a
particular
situation
handled.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
exactly
my
position.
in
other
words,
in
this
particular
case,
the
man
was
removed
from
the
hospital
over
the
protest
of
the
doctors.
now,
the
doctor
did
release
the
man,
but
he
released
the
man
because
he
thought
he
had
been
ordered
to
do
so
by
a
federal
judge.
that
was
as
circumstance
under
which
the
man
was
released
from
jail.
he
was
psychotic
when
he
went
in.
he
was
psychotic
when
he
went
out.
there
had
been
absolutely
no
improvement
or
change
in
the
prisoner’s
condition
psychiatrically
from
the
time
he
was
put
in
jail
to
the
time
he
was
taken
out.
he
was
only
in--
i’m
sorry,
in
the
hospital,
mr.
justice.
the
medical
test
only
is
that
the
man’s
condition--
mental
condition
was
exactly
the
same.
he
had
been
placed
under
some
sort
of
a
drug
treatment
and
had
been
administered
some
medication
which
did
help.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
he
had
every
choice
in
the
world.
mr.
james
deanda
left
him
in
the
hospital.
he
could’ve
been
moved
in
24
hours
according
to--
in
an
emergency
situation,
they
could
either--
in
fact,
the
federal
judge
already
ordered
that
the
man
be
confined
in
a
medical
facility,
and
he
was
returned
to
the
jail
awaiting
transfer
to
springfield,
i
believe,
when
someone
came
to
get
him.
mr.
james
deanda
mas--
i
do
not
believe
he
would
have,
mr.
justice.
i
guess
he
could
have.
i
guess
he
could’ve
put
him
anywhere
he
wanted
to
put
him,
i
would
suppose.
but,
i
do
not
believe
that,
from
a
realistic
stand
point,
i
think
his
choices
would
have
been
a
jail
like
the
nueces
county
jail.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
the
jail
did
have
a
contract
to
accept
federal
prisoners.
mr.
james
deanda
well,
it
would
limit
him
either
to
the--
well,
that’s
what
i
said.
i
think,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
that
that’s
correct
and
it
may
be
from
a
legal
standpoint
as
well.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
mr.
justice,
in
taking
in
not--
mr.
james
deanda
this
would
be
true.
mr.
james
deanda
no,
it
is
not,
because--
the
reason
it
is
not,
well,
this
trial
court
found
that
it
wasn’t.
he
found
that
both
were
negligent
in
the
matter.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
that
would
be
my
second
position,
mr.
justice,
that,
here--
this
is
i
think
what
we’re
talking
about
non-delegable
duties
which
i
haven’t
discussed
yet
but,
in
other
words,
it’s
our
position
that
the
statute
places
a
mandatory
duty
on
the
marshal
to
safely
keep
his
prisoner
and
that
he
cannot
delegate
that
responsibility--
mr.
james
deanda
that,
i
believe,
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice,
that
you
would
not
necessarily
reach
that
point
if
we
were
correct
in
what
i’ve
said
here
that
the--
and
the
trial
court
did
find--
the
trial
court
found
that
the
marshal--
mr.
james
deanda
himself
was
negligent
in
not
making
arrangements
for
constant
surveillance
of
the
man.
mr.
james
deanda
the
court
found
that
that
was
a
discretionary
function
and
we
did
not
appeal
from
that
finding,
your
honor.
mr.
james
deanda
under
the
tort
claims
act.
yes,
he
found
that
and
that--
but,
he
did
find
that
the
marital,
having
made
that
discretionary
decision,
that
then
he
had
a
duty
to
see
that
proper
arrangements
did
made
wherever
he
took
the
man,
to
see
that
he
was
safely
kept
in
keeping--
that
he
had
a
duty
of
reasonable
care
to
see
that
the
man
was
properly
taken
care
of
and
the
marshal
admits,
in
his
testimony,
the
marshal
testified--
the
deputy
marshals--
the
united
states
marshal
did
not
testify
and
had
no
actual
knowledge
of
what
transpired,
but
the
people
there
admitted
that
it
would
have
been
wrong
and
unsafe
to
take
this
man
and
place
him
in
jail
without
constant
surveillance.
mr.
james
deanda
well,
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
under
the
contract
and
under
the
practices
that
were
followed,
as
reflected
by
this
record,
that
the
marshal
did
have
a
great
deal
to
say
with
reference
to
the
keeping
of
the
man
in
the
conditions
under
which
he
was
kept.
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor--
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor,
the
circuit
court
points
out
that
the
marshal
had
no
authority
over
the
internal
operations
of
the
jail
and,
in
the
ordinary
case,
certainly
that
is
true.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
it’s
my
position,
your
honor,
that
he
did
have
a
duty,
knowing
the
mass
propensity
for
suicide
that
he
could
not
just
take
him
over
and
turn
him
over
to
someone.
it
would
be
just
as
judge
brown
said
in
his
dissent.
if
this
man
was
physically
ill
and
was
dying,
he
couldn’t
just
take
him
down
to
the
jail
and
throw
him
in
there
and
say
he
did
no
wrong
because
it
wasn’t
a
hospital
and
he
had
no
right
to
convert
it
into
a
hospital.
there
is
a
place
where
the
marshal
still
has
the
duty
and
the
control
of
the
prisoner
and
the
absolute
control
of
the
prisoner
and
that
was,
in
this
instance,
certainly
up
until
he
returned
him
to
the
jail
without--
i
may
add,
the
jailer
testified
that
all
the
marshal
told
him
to
do
was
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
prisoner,
or
words
to
that
effect,
rather
than
a
constant
surveillance.
and,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
cell
that
the
marshal
selected
was
an
isolation
cell
which
was
not
surrounded
by
bars
as
you
might
expect
but
rather
a
sheik
metal
steel
cell,
through
which
holes
had
been
punched
the
size
of
a
half
dollar
and
which
was
in
a
solitary
area
of
the
jail
and
surrounded
by
a
wire
mesh
enclosure
to
boot,
so
that
no
one
could
really
keep
an
eye
on
this
man
except
the
jailer
when
he
made
his
rounds,
and
this
is
what
the
jailer
testified
and
what
the
court
accepted
because
it
found
that
the
marshal
made
no
arrangements
for
the
constant
surveillance
of
the
man,
insofar
as
the
situation
in
which
the
man
was
placed
in
this
particular
custodial
type
situation.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
deanda
mr.
justice,
that’s
what--
mr.
james
deanda
that
would
be
a
way
of
putting
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
deanda
the
non-delegable
phase
of
it
comes
in,
mr.
justice,
when
you
have
a
situation,
and
i
believe
judge
brown
pointed
that
in
his
decision--
in
his
opinion,
excuse
me,
where
the
marshal
has
a
specific
statutory
duty
and
he
has
a
set
of
circumstances
that
he
recognizes
to
be
ultra
dangerous,
unusual.
that
in
that
situation,
i
believe,
the
judge
stated
that
the
jailer,
in
effect,
becomes
an
employee
of
the
government
for
the
purposes
of
the
tort
claims
act.
in
other
words,
that
in
accordance
with
the
general
law,
you
cannot
contract
someone
to
perform
a
statute--
certainly,
this
is
the
law
of
texas
that
you
cannot
perform--
contract
someone
to
perform
a
statute
to
a
duty
that
you
have.
and
then,
when
that
person
does
not
perform
and
performs
in
a
negligent
manner
and
breaches
a
duty
then,
at
that
time,
you
can
say
“well,
this
man
was
an
independent
contractor
and
i
have
no--
it’s
not
my
problem
anymore.”
that
duty
remains
with
a
person
upon
whom
it’s
imposed
until
it
is
carried
out.
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor--
mr.
james
deanda
well,
your
honor,
if
it
were
not
a--
if
it
were
a--
if
it
were
not
a
non-delegable
duty,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor,
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
that
speaks
of
non-delegable
duties
anymore
than
there’s
anything
in
that
statute
that
says
the
marshal’s
duty
is
to
safely
keep
the
prisoner.
it
has
been
abrogated
by
this
contract.
it
is
by
the
marshal’s
right
to
contract
with
the
state
authorities
to
keep
the
prisoners.
mr.
james
deanda
no,
your
honor.
if
the
man
was
in
the
hospital
and,
at
that
time,
the
marshal
had
taken
over,
there’s
no
question
that
at
that
time
the
marshal
was
paying
guards
around
the
clock
while
he
was
in
the
psychiatric
ward
to
take
care
of
the
man,
except
that
he
was
only
in
there
for
about
approximately
a
day
or
perhaps
a
little
less,
but
in
that
situation,
if
there
were
any
negligence
involved,
and
of
course
you
always
have
to
have
negligence,
if
there
were
any
negligence
involved,
then
of
course
i
believe
that
the
government
would
be
liable.
mr.
james
deanda
no,
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
absolute--
there’s
no
assu--
the
government
is
not
an
insurer
of
that
man’s
safety.
the
government
is
required
to
use
reasonable
care
under
the
circumstances
to
see
that
he
is
safely
kept,
and
if
taking
him
into
the
psychiatric
ward
of
the
hospital
and
providing
him
with
physicians
and
other
custodial
people
to
take
care
of
him
would
be
considered
reasonable
care,
well
then
the
government
would
have
discharged
its
duty,
and
the
man’s
suicide
would’ve
just
been
an
unfortunate
thing.
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor,
we
have--
texas
has
passed
a
tort
claims
act,
but
it
does
not
encompass
within
it
assurance.
it
would
not
take
care
of
this
situation.
your
honor,
i
feel
that
there
is
a--
that
this
case,
as
it
stands
and
as
our
brief
indicates,
conflicts
with
the
witt
case
which
is
a
second
circuit
case.
in
this
sense,
this
was
not
a--
there
was
no
con--
written
contract
between
the
military
custodian
and
the
contractor
involved
in
that
case.
this
was
a
situation
where
the
persons
in
custody
of
the
military
barracks
were
farmed
out,
so
to
speak,
to
do
work
for
a
private
club
there
in
the
vicinity
and
one
of
the
prisoners
was
injured
to
the
negligence
of
the
contractor,
and
the
government
tried
to
escape
liability
in
that
situation
by
claiming
that
the
contractor
was
not
an
employee
of
the
government.
and,
the
circuit
court
held
in
that
case
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government
custodian
to
control
and
employ
the
offenders
in
his
care
and
that
the
fact
that
he
had--
that
he
was
being
transported
back
and
forth
by
a
private
individual
did
not
permit
the
government
to
escape
that
responsibility
and
held
that
the
government
will
have
to
answer
for
liability
in
that
particular
case.
is
there
any
other
question,
your
honor?
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor,
the--
both
of
these
men
are
marshals.
the--
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
supports
this
position
really,
because
the
jailer
testified
that
he
did
talk
to
mr.
jones.
this
situation
was
a
three-way
situation
where
mr.
jones,
the
chief
deputy,
was
talking
to
the
jailer
and
mr.
bowers,
the
deputy,
on
the
ground
was
talking
to
his
immediate
superior.
but,
the
marshals--
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
chief
marshal
jones
and
that
of
mr.
lawrence,
the
county
jailer.
in
that,
the
county
jailer
testified
that
the
only
instructions
he
got
were
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
prisoner
to
watch
out
for
him,
this
type
of
language.
i
think
that
the
very
important
point,
and
the
trial
court
resolved
that
issue
against
the
government
because
the
trial
court
found
that
they
had
made
no
such
arrangements,
as
did
the
circuit
court.
but,
the
important
thing
and
the
reason
that
they
found
this
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
mr.
bowers,
after
talking
to
mr.
jones,
went
to
the
jail
and
examined
this
place
where
this
man
was
to
be
lodged
and
approved
of
everything.
and,
there
was
only
incidentally
one
bunk
in
the
cell,
so
that
common
sense
dictates
that
the
marshal
knew
there
would
be
no
one
in
there
with
this
man.
that
he
was
going
to
be
isolated
in
this
cell
by
himself.
mr.
james
deanda
he
hung
himself.
he
had
a--
he
was--
he
had
tried
to
commit
suicide
the
day
before,
on
the
23th,
mr.
justice,
by
cutting
his
wrists.
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
a
long
bandage
was
applied
to
his
arm
to
close
that
wound.
mr.
james
deanda
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
he
used
the
bandage.
the
cell
was
so-fixed
that
it
had
these
holes
everywhere,
on
the
ceiling
and
on
the
sides,
and
all
he
had
to
do
of
course
was
to
affix
the
bandage
to
the--
to
one
of
the
holes
and
it
was
in
that
way
that
he
used
the
bandage
to
hang
himself.
mr.
james
deanda
kerlix,
it
was
a
long--
it
was
a
very
long
bandage.
the
doctors
testified
that
the
bandage
would
not
have
been
dangerous
in
the
hospital
because
he
was
under
medication.
he
was
in
a
room
where
he
could
not
hurt
himself
but,
apparently,
when
the
bandage
was
applied,
it
was
not
contemplated
that
he
would
be
removed
to
the
jail.
mr.
james
deanda
well--
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
to
live
with
that
position.
the--
i
believe
the
marshal
testified
that
suicides
or
attempted
suicides
were
the
chief
cause
of
hospitalization
among
federal
prisoners
in
awaiting
trial
in
state
facilities.
i
believe
there’s
something
in
the
record
on
that,
but
there’s
no
indication
or
inclining
in
the
record
anywhere
that
this
man
could’ve
successfully
taken
his
life
had
he
been--
had
he
remained
in
the
hospital.
i
don’t
believe
anyone
does
take
that
position
at
all.
if
there
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
james
deanda
do
you
have
any
other
questions?
mr.
justice,
you
said
something
about--
mr.
james
deanda
the
question
that
was
asked,
i
believe
and
i
refer
to,
i
may
have
misinterpreted
the
question,
there
was
no
remedy
under
the
texas
tort
claims
act.
we
have
a
new
act
which
excludes
certain
activities
of
which
this
is
on,
and
so
there
is
no
remedy
under
the
texas
tort
claims
act.
mr.
james
deanda
there
may
be
a
cause
of
action
against
the
sheriff
direct
for
negligence.
the
counsel
may
well
be
right,
although
i’m
not
really
prepared
to
make
a
statement
on
it.
mr.
james
deanda
it
would
not
fall
within
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
deanda
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
arising
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
resulting
from
the
suicidal
death
of
a
federal
prisoner
confined
in
a
state
facility.
the
district
court,
in
this
instance,
found
both
the
marshal
and
the
sheriff,
the
state
official
involved,
negligent.
it
found
the
marshal
negligent
in
not
making
arrangements
for
a
constant
surveillance
of
the
deceased
and
found
the
sheriff
negligent
for
making
inadequate--
for
having
inadequate
surveillance
procedures.
the
circuit
court
approved
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
but
held
that,
insofar
as
the
marshal’s
negligence
was
concerned,
that
the
marshal
had
no
authority
to
control
jail
functions
and,
therefore,
no
duty
of
safekeeping
of
the
prisoner
and
that,
insofar
as
the
sheriff
is
concerned,
that
he
was
an
independent
contractor
as
defined
under
the
tort
claims
act
and,
therefore,
the
government
had
no
liability
for
his
conduct
which
brings
us
to
the
issue
in
the
case
which
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
can
exempt
itself
from
liability
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
a
negligent
injury
to
a
prisoner
by
simply
turning
him
over
to
a
local
jail.
this
is
extremely
important
because
if
this
were
the
law,
first
of
all,
you
would
have
two
standards
insofar
as
the--
as
persons
in
detainment
are
concerned,
that
is
federal
prisoners
in
non-federal
institutions,
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
tort
claims
act
remedies,
nor
will
they
have
the
rights
of
the
protection
afforded
by
the--
by
section
4042
and
4086
which
requires
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
safely
keep
the
prisoner
and
require
the
us
marshal
to
safely
keep
his
prisoners.
it
would
also
result
in
a
situation
where,
actually,
a--
where,
in
the
usual
case
where
a
man
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
is
confined
in
a
federal
institution
has
really
more
rights
than
one
who
is
simply
charged
with
a
crime
that
has
not
yet
been
tried
because,
i
believe
as
statistic
shows
that
are
in
the
record
in
this
case,
the
persons
that
are
confined
in
state
institutions
for
the
most
part
are
persons
who
have
not
yet
been
convicted
of
crime.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
the
record
was
that
there
were
approximately
4,000
federal
prisoners
in
one
day
that
are
confined
in
state
institutions
of
various
types
and,
for
the
most
part,
awaiting
trial
on
different
offenses.
the
dissenting--
there
was
a
motion
filed
in
a
hearing
involved
before
the
circuit
which
was
denied
by
the
circuit,
but
there
was
a
dissent
filed
in
that
matter,
and
the
basis
of
the
dissent
was
that
the
breach
of
the
statutory
duty
on
the
part
of
the
marshal
occurred
when
the
prisoner
was
confined
in
the
jail
under
circumstances
that
the
marshal
knew
were
dangerous
and
without
taking
specific
precautions.
in
other
words,
the
dissent
stated
that,
really,
whether
or
not
the--
that
this
contract
between
the
government
and
the
nueces
county
jail
was
really
irrelevant
and
that
the
marshal
himself
was
guilty
of
acts
of
negligence
in
taking
this
man
and
turning
him
over
to
the
sheriff
of
nueces
county
without
making
assurances
that
he
would
be
cared
for,
knowing
the
very
peculiar
and
special
circumstances
that
surrounded
the
case.
mr.
james
deanda
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe--
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
negligence
would
be
in
selecting
the
contractor.
the
negligence
would
be
in,
and
the
negligence
that
the
court
found
was
in
not
making
arrangements
for
the
man
to
be--
the
arrangements
that
were
necessary
under
the
record
to
keep
the
man
safely
that
is,
the
marital,
for
example,
even
though
he
took
the
man
to
jail
could
have,
just
as
they
had
a
guard
for
him
at
the
hospital
after
his
first
suicidal
effort
could
have
gotten
a
guard
for
him
to
watching
and
maintain
constant
observation
while
the
man
was
in
jail
and
the--
although
the
government
places
a
great
deal
of
weight
on
the
inability
of
the
marshal
to
control
the
things
in
the
jail.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
everything
that
occurred
in
that
jail
when
this
man
was
returned
was
done
so
with
the
blessings
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
marshal.
everything
that
the
jailer
did,
the
type
of
cell
that
the
man
was
putting
him
was
all
done
because
the
marshal
wanted
it
done
that
way,
and
the
contract
with
the--
between
the
government
and
the
jail
permits
this.
the--
there’s
a
real
question
in
my
mind
that
there’s
anything
approaching
an
independent
contractor
situation
here
in
a
situation
of
this
type
because
the
regulations
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
as
shown
in
the
transcript,
really
live
it
up
to
the
marshal
when
a
particular
unusual
situation
occurs,
specifically
either
a
medical
situation
or
one
involving
custodial
problems.
that’s
not
the
not
the
run
and
the
mill
case
where
the
sheriff
is
just
simply
babysitting
with
somebody
that’s
in
jail
and
charged
with
a
crime,
that
he
is
to
call
the
marshal
and
find
out
what
the
marshal
wants
done
with
the
man
and
how
he
wants
a
particular
situation
handled.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
exactly
my
position.
in
other
words,
in
this
particular
case,
the
man
was
removed
from
the
hospital
over
the
protest
of
the
doctors.
now,
the
doctor
did
release
the
man,
but
he
released
the
man
because
he
thought
he
had
been
ordered
to
do
so
by
a
federal
judge.
that
was
as
circumstance
under
which
the
man
was
released
from
jail.
he
was
psychotic
when
he
went
in.
he
was
psychotic
when
he
went
out.
there
had
been
absolutely
no
improvement
or
change
in
the
prisoner’s
condition
psychiatrically
from
the
time
he
was
put
in
jail
to
the
time
he
was
taken
out.
he
was
only
in--
i’m
sorry,
in
the
hospital,
mr.
justice.
the
medical
test
only
is
that
the
man’s
condition--
mental
condition
was
exactly
the
same.
he
had
been
placed
under
some
sort
of
a
drug
treatment
and
had
been
administered
some
medication
which
did
help.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
he
had
every
choice
in
the
world.
mr.
james
deanda
left
him
in
the
hospital.
he
could’ve
been
moved
in
24
hours
according
to--
in
an
emergency
situation,
they
could
either--
in
fact,
the
federal
judge
already
ordered
that
the
man
be
confined
in
a
medical
facility,
and
he
was
returned
to
the
jail
awaiting
transfer
to
springfield,
i
believe,
when
someone
came
to
get
him.
mr.
james
deanda
mas--
i
do
not
believe
he
would
have,
mr.
justice.
i
guess
he
could
have.
i
guess
he
could’ve
put
him
anywhere
he
wanted
to
put
him,
i
would
suppose.
but,
i
do
not
believe
that,
from
a
realistic
stand
point,
i
think
his
choices
would
have
been
a
jail
like
the
nueces
county
jail.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
the
jail
did
have
a
contract
to
accept
federal
prisoners.
mr.
james
deanda
well,
it
would
limit
him
either
to
the--
well,
that’s
what
i
said.
i
think,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
that
that’s
correct
and
it
may
be
from
a
legal
standpoint
as
well.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
mr.
justice,
in
taking
in
not--
mr.
james
deanda
this
would
be
true.
mr.
james
deanda
no,
it
is
not,
because--
the
reason
it
is
not,
well,
this
trial
court
found
that
it
wasn’t.
he
found
that
both
were
negligent
in
the
matter.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
that
would
be
my
second
position,
mr.
justice,
that,
here--
this
is
i
think
what
we’re
talking
about
non-delegable
duties
which
i
haven’t
discussed
yet
but,
in
other
words,
it’s
our
position
that
the
statute
places
a
mandatory
duty
on
the
marshal
to
safely
keep
his
prisoner
and
that
he
cannot
delegate
that
responsibility--
mr.
james
deanda
that,
i
believe,
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice,
that
you
would
not
necessarily
reach
that
point
if
we
were
correct
in
what
i’ve
said
here
that
the--
and
the
trial
court
did
find--
the
trial
court
found
that
the
marshal--
mr.
james
deanda
himself
was
negligent
in
not
making
arrangements
for
constant
surveillance
of
the
man.
mr.
james
deanda
the
court
found
that
that
was
a
discretionary
function
and
we
did
not
appeal
from
that
finding,
your
honor.
mr.
james
deanda
under
the
tort
claims
act.
yes,
he
found
that
and
that--
but,
he
did
find
that
the
marital,
having
made
that
discretionary
decision,
that
then
he
had
a
duty
to
see
that
proper
arrangements
did
made
wherever
he
took
the
man,
to
see
that
he
was
safely
kept
in
keeping--
that
he
had
a
duty
of
reasonable
care
to
see
that
the
man
was
properly
taken
care
of
and
the
marshal
admits,
in
his
testimony,
the
marshal
testified--
the
deputy
marshals--
the
united
states
marshal
did
not
testify
and
had
no
actual
knowledge
of
what
transpired,
but
the
people
there
admitted
that
it
would
have
been
wrong
and
unsafe
to
take
this
man
and
place
him
in
jail
without
constant
surveillance.
mr.
james
deanda
well,
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
under
the
contract
and
under
the
practices
that
were
followed,
as
reflected
by
this
record,
that
the
marshal
did
have
a
great
deal
to
say
with
reference
to
the
keeping
of
the
man
in
the
conditions
under
which
he
was
kept.
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor--
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor,
the
circuit
court
points
out
that
the
marshal
had
no
authority
over
the
internal
operations
of
the
jail
and,
in
the
ordinary
case,
certainly
that
is
true.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
it’s
my
position,
your
honor,
that
he
did
have
a
duty,
knowing
the
mass
propensity
for
suicide
that
he
could
not
just
take
him
over
and
turn
him
over
to
someone.
it
would
be
just
as
judge
brown
said
in
his
dissent.
if
this
man
was
physically
ill
and
was
dying,
he
couldn’t
just
take
him
down
to
the
jail
and
throw
him
in
there
and
say
he
did
no
wrong
because
it
wasn’t
a
hospital
and
he
had
no
right
to
convert
it
into
a
hospital.
there
is
a
place
where
the
marshal
still
has
the
duty
and
the
control
of
the
prisoner
and
the
absolute
control
of
the
prisoner
and
that
was,
in
this
instance,
certainly
up
until
he
returned
him
to
the
jail
without--
i
may
add,
the
jailer
testified
that
all
the
marshal
told
him
to
do
was
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
prisoner,
or
words
to
that
effect,
rather
than
a
constant
surveillance.
and,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
cell
that
the
marshal
selected
was
an
isolation
cell
which
was
not
surrounded
by
bars
as
you
might
expect
but
rather
a
sheik
metal
steel
cell,
through
which
holes
had
been
punched
the
size
of
a
half
dollar
and
which
was
in
a
solitary
area
of
the
jail
and
surrounded
by
a
wire
mesh
enclosure
to
boot,
so
that
no
one
could
really
keep
an
eye
on
this
man
except
the
jailer
when
he
made
his
rounds,
and
this
is
what
the
jailer
testified
and
what
the
court
accepted
because
it
found
that
the
marshal
made
no
arrangements
for
the
constant
surveillance
of
the
man,
insofar
as
the
situation
in
which
the
man
was
placed
in
this
particular
custodial
type
situation.
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
deanda
mr.
justice,
that’s
what--
mr.
james
deanda
that
would
be
a
way
of
putting
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
deanda
the
non-delegable
phase
of
it
comes
in,
mr.
justice,
when
you
have
a
situation,
and
i
believe
judge
brown
pointed
that
in
his
decision--
in
his
opinion,
excuse
me,
where
the
marshal
has
a
specific
statutory
duty
and
he
has
a
set
of
circumstances
that
he
recognizes
to
be
ultra
dangerous,
unusual.
that
in
that
situation,
i
believe,
the
judge
stated
that
the
jailer,
in
effect,
becomes
an
employee
of
the
government
for
the
purposes
of
the
tort
claims
act.
in
other
words,
that
in
accordance
with
the
general
law,
you
cannot
contract
someone
to
perform
a
statute--
certainly,
this
is
the
law
of
texas
that
you
cannot
perform--
contract
someone
to
perform
a
statute
to
a
duty
that
you
have.
and
then,
when
that
person
does
not
perform
and
performs
in
a
negligent
manner
and
breaches
a
duty
then,
at
that
time,
you
can
say
“well,
this
man
was
an
independent
contractor
and
i
have
no--
it’s
not
my
problem
anymore.”
that
duty
remains
with
a
person
upon
whom
it’s
imposed
until
it
is
carried
out.
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor--
mr.
james
deanda
well,
your
honor,
if
it
were
not
a--
if
it
were
a--
if
it
were
not
a
non-delegable
duty,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor,
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
that
speaks
of
non-delegable
duties
anymore
than
there’s
anything
in
that
statute
that
says
the
marshal’s
duty
is
to
safely
keep
the
prisoner.
it
has
been
abrogated
by
this
contract.
it
is
by
the
marshal’s
right
to
contract
with
the
state
authorities
to
keep
the
prisoners.
mr.
james
deanda
no,
your
honor.
if
the
man
was
in
the
hospital
and,
at
that
time,
the
marshal
had
taken
over,
there’s
no
question
that
at
that
time
the
marshal
was
paying
guards
around
the
clock
while
he
was
in
the
psychiatric
ward
to
take
care
of
the
man,
except
that
he
was
only
in
there
for
about
approximately
a
day
or
perhaps
a
little
less,
but
in
that
situation,
if
there
were
any
negligence
involved,
and
of
course
you
always
have
to
have
negligence,
if
there
were
any
negligence
involved,
then
of
course
i
believe
that
the
government
would
be
liable.
mr.
james
deanda
no,
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
absolute--
there’s
no
assu--
the
government
is
not
an
insurer
of
that
man’s
safety.
the
government
is
required
to
use
reasonable
care
under
the
circumstances
to
see
that
he
is
safely
kept,
and
if
taking
him
into
the
psychiatric
ward
of
the
hospital
and
providing
him
with
physicians
and
other
custodial
people
to
take
care
of
him
would
be
considered
reasonable
care,
well
then
the
government
would
have
discharged
its
duty,
and
the
man’s
suicide
would’ve
just
been
an
unfortunate
thing.
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor,
we
have--
texas
has
passed
a
tort
claims
act,
but
it
does
not
encompass
within
it
assurance.
it
would
not
take
care
of
this
situation.
your
honor,
i
feel
that
there
is
a--
that
this
case,
as
it
stands
and
as
our
brief
indicates,
conflicts
with
the
witt
case
which
is
a
second
circuit
case.
in
this
sense,
this
was
not
a--
there
was
no
con--
written
contract
between
the
military
custodian
and
the
contractor
involved
in
that
case.
this
was
a
situation
where
the
persons
in
custody
of
the
military
barracks
were
farmed
out,
so
to
speak,
to
do
work
for
a
private
club
there
in
the
vicinity
and
one
of
the
prisoners
was
injured
to
the
negligence
of
the
contractor,
and
the
government
tried
to
escape
liability
in
that
situation
by
claiming
that
the
contractor
was
not
an
employee
of
the
government.
and,
the
circuit
court
held
in
that
case
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government
custodian
to
control
and
employ
the
offenders
in
his
care
and
that
the
fact
that
he
had--
that
he
was
being
transported
back
and
forth
by
a
private
individual
did
not
permit
the
government
to
escape
that
responsibility
and
held
that
the
government
will
have
to
answer
for
liability
in
that
particular
case.
is
there
any
other
question,
your
honor?
mr.
james
deanda
your
honor,
the--
both
of
these
men
are
marshals.
the--
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
supports
this
position
really,
because
the
jailer
testified
that
he
did
talk
to
mr.
jones.
this
situation
was
a
three-way
situation
where
mr.
jones,
the
chief
deputy,
was
talking
to
the
jailer
and
mr.
bowers,
the
deputy,
on
the
ground
was
talking
to
his
immediate
superior.
but,
the
marshals--
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
chief
marshal
jones
and
that
of
mr.
lawrence,
the
county
jailer.
in
that,
the
county
jailer
testified
that
the
only
instructions
he
got
were
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
prisoner
to
watch
out
for
him,
this
type
of
language.
i
think
that
the
very
important
point,
and
the
trial
court
resolved
that
issue
against
the
government
because
the
trial
court
found
that
they
had
made
no
such
arrangements,
as
did
the
circuit
court.
but,
the
important
thing
and
the
reason
that
they
found
this
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
mr.
bowers,
after
talking
to
mr.
jones,
went
to
the
jail
and
examined
this
place
where
this
man
was
to
be
lodged
and
approved
of
everything.
and,
there
was
only
incidentally
one
bunk
in
the
cell,
so
that
common
sense
dictates
that
the
marshal
knew
there
would
be
no
one
in
there
with
this
man.
that
he
was
going
to
be
isolated
in
this
cell
by
himself.
mr.
james
deanda
he
hung
himself.
he
had
a--
he
was--
he
had
tried
to
commit
suicide
the
day
before,
on
the
23th,
mr.
justice,
by
cutting
his
wrists.
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
a
long
bandage
was
applied
to
his
arm
to
close
that
wound.
mr.
james
deanda
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
he
used
the
bandage.
the
cell
was
so-fixed
that
it
had
these
holes
everywhere,
on
the
ceiling
and
on
the
sides,
and
all
he
had
to
do
of
course
was
to
affix
the
bandage
to
the--
to
one
of
the
holes
and
it
was
in
that
way
that
he
used
the
bandage
to
hang
himself.
mr.
james
deanda
kerlix,
it
was
a
long--
it
was
a
very
long
bandage.
the
doctors
testified
that
the
bandage
would
not
have
been
dangerous
in
the
hospital
because
he
was
under
medication.
he
was
in
a
room
where
he
could
not
hurt
himself
but,
apparently,
when
the
bandage
was
applied,
it
was
not
contemplated
that
he
would
be
removed
to
the
jail.
mr.
james
deanda
well--
mr.
james
deanda
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
to
live
with
that
position.
the--
i
believe
the
marshal
testified
that
suicides
or
attempted
suicides
were
the
chief
cause
of
hospitalization
among
federal
prisoners
in
awaiting
trial
in
state
facilities.
i
believe
there’s
something
in
the
record
on
that,
but
there’s
no
indication
or
inclining
in
the
record
anywhere
that
this
man
could’ve
successfully
taken
his
life
had
he
been--
had
he
remained
in
the
hospital.
i
don’t
believe
anyone
does
take
that
position
at
all.
if
there
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
james
deanda
do
you
have
any
other
questions?
mr.
justice,
you
said
something
about--
mr.
james
deanda
the
question
that
was
asked,
i
believe
and
i
refer
to,
i
may
have
misinterpreted
the
question,
there
was
no
remedy
under
the
texas
tort
claims
act.
we
have
a
new
act
which
excludes
certain
activities
of
which
this
is
on,
and
so
there
is
no
remedy
under
the
texas
tort
claims
act.
mr.
james
deanda
there
may
be
a
cause
of
action
against
the
sheriff
direct
for
negligence.
the
counsel
may
well
be
right,
although
i’m
not
really
prepared
to
make
a
statement
on
it.
mr.
james
deanda
it
would
not
fall
within
it,
mr.
justice.
