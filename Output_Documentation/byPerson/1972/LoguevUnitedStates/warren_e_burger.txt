mr.

chief

warren
e.

what
did
the
district
court
find
with
respect
to
the
marshal’s
decision
to
move
in
from
the
hospital
to
the
local
jail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
discretionary
function
for
which
there
could
be
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
deanda,
what
does
your
position
leave
of
the
statute,
section
2671
which
reads,
with
some
omissions,
as
used
in
this
chapter,
as
used
in
this
title,
the
term
“federal
agency”
does
not
include
any
contractor
with
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn’t
leave
very
much
of
it,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
the
statute
speak
about
the
non-delegable
duties,
what
section?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
the
situation
if
he
had--
this
man
had
committed
suicide
while
in
the
hospital?
was
the
hospital
a
contractor
with
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is,
for
example,
if
they
had
put
him
in
the
hospital
and
just
drop
the
matter
there,
then
you
might
argue
that
that
would
be
negligence
in
it
of
itself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
evans.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
are
you
on,
mr.
evans?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
evans--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn’t
the
district
court
review
all
that
and
hold,
in
effect,
made
a
finding
and
a
conclusion
that
even
if
it
was
a
mistake
in
judgment,
it
was
a
mistake
in
judgment
under
the
discretionary
provisions
if
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
which
there
could
be
no
liability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
understand
mr.
dandridge
to
concede
that
that’s
out
of
the
case
because
he
did
not
file
a
cross-petition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
this,
being
a
non-jury
case,
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
as
good
a
position
as
the
district
court
to
make
a
finding
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
was
bowers
who
had
that
conversation,
not
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
evidence
disputed
anywhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
the
district
judge
requested
to
address
a
finding
to
that
subject
at
any
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
say
we
must
read
that
last
sentence
as
a
finding
based
on
the
totality
of
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
once
having
gone
into
the
subject
and
discussed
the
activities
of
marshal
bowers,
it
does
leave
some
problems
hanging
in
midair
a
little
bit,
doesn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
indeed
they
were
relying
upon
the
conversation
between
jones
and
the
jailer,
we
have
surmised
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
referring
to
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
evans.
mr.
deanda,
you
have
a
minute
left
but
you
might
address
to
justice
stewart’s
question.

you,
