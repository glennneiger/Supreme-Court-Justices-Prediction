mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
position,
simply
stated,
is
this.
first,
although
the
united
states
would
be
liable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
injury
to
a
federal
prisoner
caused
by
the
negligence
by
a
federal
marshal,
the
deputy
marshals
here
acted
reasonably,
in
accord
with
due
care
and
they
violated
no
duty
owed
to
regan
logue.
second,
because
the
united
states
had
no
right
to
control
the
physical
conduct
of
the
jailers
employed
by
the
county
jail,
the
government
cannot
be
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
injury
resulting
from
the
negligent
conduct
of
those
employees.
i
think,
in
light
of
mr.
deanda’s
argument
that
it
might
be
fruitful
to
start
with
a
focus
on
the
precise
findings
that
the
district
court
made
for
the
respect
of
both
of
these
points.
they
appear
in
volume
2
of
the
appendix
at
pages
608
and
609.
the
important
point
to
make,
i
think,
is
that
the
only
federal
officer
whom
the
district
court
found
to
be
negligent
was
deputy
bowers,
that
is
the
deputy
who
was
on
the
scene
in
corpus
christi,
and
his
negligence,
in
the
court’s
view,
consisted
solely
in
the--
of
failing
to
make
“specific
arrangements”
for
logue’
s
surveillance
while
he
was
confined
to
the
jail.
there
is
no
finding
that
bowers
was
negligent
in
removing
logue
from
the
hospital
and,
as
mr.
deanda
stated
here,
the
district
court
found
that
to
be
a
discretionary
act
and
that
matter
was
not
argued
on
appeal.
moreover,
there’s
no
finding
that
any
other
federal
officer
was
negligent
in
any
way.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
page
608
and
609
of
volume
2.
second,
at
the
top
of
page
609,
the
district
court
found
that
the
jail’s
employees
were
negligent
in
failing
to
provide
adequate
surveillance
while
logue
was
confined
in
the
jail.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
the
district
court’s
findings
of
fact.
that
is,
it
did
not
disagree
that
bowers
had
failed
to
make
specific
arrangements
for
logue’s
surveillance.
it
held,
however,
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
failure
did
not
violate
any
duty
owed
to
logue.
in
our
view,
the
record
fully
supports
this
holding
because
it
shows
that
the
specific
arrangements
for
logue’s
surveillance,
that
is,
the
arrangements
that
bowers
failed
personally
to
make
were,
in
fact,
made
by
bowers’
supervisor,
deputy
jones.
i
think
a
little
background
might
be
helpful.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
knowing
that
a
man
is
eminently
suicidal
as
they
did
here,
that
they
had
a
duty
to
take
precautions
to
ensure
that
he
did
not
commit
suicide
while
he
was
in
the
jail.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record
whether
the
marshall
was
aware
of
the
type
of
bandage
that
have
been
placed
on
the
man’s
arm.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
he
saw
it
but
the
bandage--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
could’ve
been,
so
far
as
it
can
be
told
from
the
record
that
it
wasn’t
clear
whether
it
was
a
gauze
with
tape
or
whether
it
was
a
wraparound
bandage,
as
in
fact
it
was.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
he
knew
that
it
was
a
bandage
on
the
arm,
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
he
did.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
he
could’ve
left
him
in
the
hospital.
the
decision
was
made
to
remove
him
from
the
hospital
because
of
the
laps
of
time
that
would
be
necessary
to--
before
he
could
be
transported
to
the
springfield
missouri
medical
center
for
federal
prisoners
where
the
district
court
in
loreto
had
ordered
him
to
be
sent
or
was
about
to
order
him
to
be
sent.
the
order
had
not
yet
been
signed
when
he
had
been
removed
from
the
hospital.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
sir.
he
was
not
being
treated.
he
was
being
held
there
for
his
safety
but
he
was
not
under
medical
treatment
at
the
time.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
he
was
under--
he
had
been
given
a
tranquilizer
at
the
time
of
his
admission.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
because
he
was
psychotic.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
does.
the
marshal
was
very
conscientious.
the
deputy
on
the
scene,
deputy
bowers,
was
very
conscientious
to
find
out
what
the
purpose
of
mr.
logue’s
confinement
and
hospitalization.
he
discussed
it
both
with
the
admitting
physician
and
with
the
physician
who
took
over
the
case,
a
psychiatrist.
and,
the
information
he
was
given
was
that
the
man
was
hospitalized
because
he
was
suicidal
and
there
was
some
danger
that
he
might
hurt
himself.
there
was--
he
is
not
any
longer
hospitalized
for
any
physical
or
medical
treatment
purposes.
at
that
point,
the
question
came
up
when
there
was
going
to
be
a
laps
of
time
before
he
was
going
to
be
transferred
to
springfield,
what
to
do
with
him
in
the
meantime.
the
marshal
on
the
scene,
deputy
bowers,
was
concerned
that
the
security
in
the
hospital
was
inadequate
and
he
communicated
that
concern
to
his
superior.
his
superior
said
“well,
let’s
see
if
we
can
make
some
kind
of
safe
arrangements
with
the
jail
and,
if
we
can
and
if
the
doctor
will
release
him,
let’s
move
him
to
the
jail.”
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
was
a
guard
fulltime
while
mr.
logue
was
in
the
hospital
but,
i
must
add,
the
record
shows
that
the,
what
marshals
refer
to
as,
key
control
was
very
loose
and,
of
course,
the
man
in
a
psychotic
state
is
not
inconceivable
that
he
can
take
over
a
single
guard.
the
kind
of
surveillance,
a
man
was
sitting
outside
the
room,
as
i
understand
it.
there
was
a
window
to
the
room
and,
every
now
and
then,
he’d
look.
but,
there
was--
if
you
have
a
situation
where
a
key
control
is
loose
where
a
man
is
psychotic,
there’s
always
a
chance
that
he
can
be
overtaken.
the
judgment,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
marshal’s
superiors
was
that,
where
the
security
is
adequate,
it
would
be
best
if
possible
and
if
the
doctor
would
release
the
man,
to
put
him
back
in
the
jail.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
his--
the
principal
point,
and
the
marshals
reiterated
this
during
the
trial,
was
the
man’s
health
and
safety,
but--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s--
the
point
was
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
be
in
the
hospital,
safe
to
protect
himself
from
injuring
himself.
and,
the
marshals
had,
i
think,
reasonably
assured
themselves
that
he
would
be
protected
against
injuring
himself
if
he
were
placed
back
in
the
jail.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there’s
no
other
need
for
him
to
be
in
the
hospital.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
understood
him
to
say
the
same
thing.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
leads
only
to--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right
and,
as
i
was
suggesting
before,
i
think
that
the
marshals
did
undertake
that
duty
and
did
satisfy
it.
it
turned
out
that
they
didn’t
foresee
every
possibility
but,
in
our
view,
they
did
satisfy
that
they
had
under
the
circumstances.
and,
i
think
the
circumstances
are
important
to
have
clearly
in
mind.
it
was
at
the
suggestion
of
logue’s
physician
in
the
hospital
and
with
the
help
of
logue’s
attorney
that
bowers,
that’s
the
deputy
on
the
scene
again,
had
arranged
for
the
court
order
committing
logue
to
springfield,
missouri
for
a
competency
determination
and
also
for
his
safekeeping
during
this
period
of
his
psychosis.
as
i
indicated
before,
it
was
because
of
a
laps
of
time
that
was
to
be
involved
that
they
determined
that
there--
something
had
to
be
done
with
him
in
the
meantime
and
the
determination
was
made
for
reasons
that
i
think
were
satisfactory
in
the
record
but
are,
in
any
event,
are
within
the
discretionary
function
aspect
of
the
act,
that
they
ought
to
keep
him
at
the
jail
rather
than
at
the
hospital
if
the
jail’s
facilities
could
be
adequately
prepared
for
a
man
in
this
person’s
condition.
deputy
bower’s
supervisor,
deputy
jones
who
was
located
in
loreto,
telephoned
the
chief
jailer
of
the
nueces
county
jail.
he
explained
the
situation
in
some
detail,
indicated
that
the
man
was
suicidal,
and
asked
whether
there
were--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
sir.
there
were--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s
important
only
in
the
sense
that
he
did
not
resolve
those
facts
against
us,
as
mr.
deanda
suggested.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
this,
in
our
view,
is
in
the
essence
of
what
the
court
of
appeals’
holding
was.
in
essence,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that,
in
light
of
all
the
circumstances
in
the
record,
the
failure
of
deputy
bowers
by
himself
was
not
a
bridge
of
any
duty
because
the
duty
had
already
been
satisfied,
in
effect,
by
his
superior
and
satisfied
by
bowers
because
bowers
was
aware
that
the
duty
had
already
been
satisfied
by
his
superior.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that’s
a
reasonable
interpretation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
significance
is
that
bowers’
superior,
supervisor
deputy
jones--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i’m
just
relating
him
as
what
his
function
was
in
the
operation.
there’s
no
significance
to
his
being
a
superior.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
we
might
be
here
anyway,
but
i
wouldn’t
be
making
the
same
arguments.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
reason
that--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
absent
jones’
conversation,
i
might
make
an
argument
on
the
record,
mr.
justice,
that
he
was
not
negligent
but
i
think
that
we
would
be
bound
and
the
court
of
appeals
will
be
bound
by
the
findings
made
by
the
district
court.
but
my
point,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
answer
your
question,
is
that
the
finding
as
to
what
bowers
did
and
did
not
do,
in
the
court
of
appeals’
view,
did
not--
the
finding
that
the
district
court
made
did
not
constitute
negligence
because
there
was
no
duty
that
was
breached
thereby.
in
other
words,
the
legal
question
is
to
what
duty
was
required
of
deputy
bowers.
it
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
addressing
its
attention
to,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
that’s--
well,
that’s
not
exactly
right.
bowers
was
made
aware
by
deputy
jones
about
the
conversation
with
the
jailer.
jones
directed
bowers,
since
he
was
on
the
scene,
to
inspect
the
cell
and
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
adequately
prepared
and
that
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
with
the
jailer
would
be
carried
out,
and
he
did
so.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i’m
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
mr.
justice,
i
agree
that
we
are
not
suggesting
that
deputy
bowers
made
specific
arrangements
for
the
surveillance
of--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
we
are
suggesting
that
deputy
bowers
was--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
even
though
the
district
court
found
that
he
had
failed
to
make
specific
arrangements
and
that
that
was
not
negligent.
we
agree
that
he
had
failed
to
make
specific
arrangement,
but
we
do
not
agree
that
he
was
negligent
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
held
that
there
was
no
duty
to
make
those
specific
arrangements
into
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don’t
believe
any
of
the
marshals
themselves
were
made
part
of
it.
i
think
it
was
a
suite
that’s
just
against
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
certainly,
because
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
supervisor
made
the
necessary
arrangements
with
the
jailer
of
the
county
jail.
what
he
told
the
county
jailer
was
the
man
was
suicidal.
“you’d
have
to
prepare
a
special
cell.
take
out
everything
from
that
cell
that
a
man
could
possibly
use
to
hurt
himself.
when
he’s
brought
back
to
the
jail,
strip
him
down
to
his
shorts
and
keep
someone
watching
him.”
now,
he
specifically
suggested
to
satisfy
the
observation
part
of
his
suggestion
that
his
one
or
two
trustees,
that
his
favored
inmates
be
placed
either
in
the
cell
with
the
prisoner
or
right
outside
where
they
could
watch
him
continually.
now
in
those
circumstances,
if
his
instructions
had
been
carried
out
and,
incidentally,
the
chief
jailer
expressly
agreed
and
indicated
that
he
would
carry
out
those
instructions
and
suggestions,
if
they
had
been
carried
out,
it
would
have
been,
i
won’t
say
impossible
for
the
man
to
commit
suicide
because
it’s
never--
you
can
try
to
say
when
a
man
is--
truly
intends
to
commit
suicide,
that
it
would
have
been
possible
for
him
to
do
it.
it
would’ve
been
much
more
difficult
under
the
circumstances.
our
point,
basically,
is
that
if
there
was
a
failure
here,
the
failure
was
not
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
federal
marshals
involved,
all
them
acted
reasonably,
but
rather
on
the
part
of
the
county
jailer.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
that
was
jones.
jones
had
the
telephone
conversation
with
the
chief
jailer
in
which
he
made
these
specific
arrangements.
bowers,
at
jones’
instructions,
personally
visited
the
jail,
inspected
the
cell,
assured
himself
that
all
dangerous
objects
had
been
removed,
determined
that
it
was
convenient
for
observation
by
the
jail
authorities.
and,
later,
when
he
brought
logue
to
the
jail,
he
again
inspected
it,
again
determined
it
was
safe,
had
a
conversation
evidently
with
the
jailers
there,
instructed
them
again
as
to
what
need
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
surveillance,
and
left.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
only
dispute
was
that
the
chief
jailer
of
the
nueces
county
jail
testified.
i
characterize
his
testimony
as
somewhat
hazy,
but
it
made
up
maybe
a
subjective
view
of
it.
his
memory
was
only
that
he
did
what
he
thought
he’d
been
told
to
do
which
was
to
have
the
man
placed
in
his
cell,
but
to
check
him
only
periodically.
what
they
had
done
is--
the
chief
jailer
and
his
staff,
when
they
had
business
on
the
second
floor
of
the
jail
where
logue
was
confined,
would
look
in
on
him.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i’m
not
sure
i
could
answer
that--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there’s
an
easy
answer,
but
it’s
in--
the
proposed
findings
are
in
the
appendix.
i’m
not
familiar
enough
with
them
at
this
point
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right,
i’m
in
total--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
have--
mr.
mark

page?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s--
i
agree
that
it’s
not
explicitly
rested
on
that,
mr.
justice,
but
in
my
view,
the
final
sentence
of
the
paragraph
you’ve
just
read
is
the
sentence
i’m
focusing
on
and
i’m
supporting
that
by
the
reasoning
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
make
explicit.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
well,
that
may
be
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
it.
i
think
what--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
we
agreed
that
bowers
had
a
duty.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
what
the
court--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
case
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it’s
not
clear
from
this
opinion
that
they--
the
reasoning
that
underlies
its
decision
is
the
same
reason
that
i’m
urging
on
this
court,
but
i
don’t
think
that
we
are
foreclosed
for
making
the
argument
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
would
say
that
it,
in
a
sense,
involves
a
factual
assessment
that
is--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it’s
not
a
constitutional
assessment.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i’m
not
sure
that
this--
the
assessment
that
his--
it’s
not
clear,
that’s
been
made
wasn’t,
in
fact,
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
necessary
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
expressly
stated
that
it
was
viewing
the
facts.
as
i’m
suggesting,
the
facts
could
be
viewed.
the
record
is
there.
it’s
basically
undisputed
and,
in
my
view,
it
can
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
supported
by
viewing
the
record
as
it
stands.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
summarily
affirmed
or
summarily
reversed
without
opinion
in
a
case
like
this,
i
think
we
could
be
here
making
the
same
argument.
i
don’t
think
that
the
failure
to
express
precisely
the
reason
that
we’re
urging
is
fatal.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
don’t
see
the
problems,
but--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
we
can
surmise
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
aware
of
what
was
in
the
record,
and
that
was
clearly
in
the
record.
i
don’t
know
that
it’s--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
don’t--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
the--
that’s
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
had
in
mind
was
that
the--
to
their
view,
the
district
court
was
suggesting
that
the
specific
arrangements
that
bowers
neglected
to
make
or
failed
to
make
would’ve
required
him
personally
to
stand
in
the
jail
and
watch
the
prisoner
and
i
think,
in
essence,
what
they
were
saying
was
he
had
no
duty
to
do
that.
but,
as
i
said,
i
think
that
the
judgment
can
be
supported
on
the
reason
i’m
urging
even
though
they
haven’t
made
it
as
explicit
as
i
have.
i
think
the--
to
turn
to
the
second
point
here
which
has
to
do
with
whether
assuming
the
marshals
themselves
were
not
negligent,
the
united
states
is
nonetheless
liable
for
the
torts
of
the
jail’s
employees.
in
our
view,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
forecloses
that
kind
of
derivative
liability,
and
the
government
is
liable
because
the
government
is
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
only
for
the
torts
of
federal
employees.
the
wisdom
of
that
limitation
is
plain.
if
the
united
states
were
held
liable
for
the
torts
of
the
county
jailers
over
whom
the
government
can
exercise
no
direct
supervision,
the
government
would
face
a
potentially
large
financial
burden
and
it
would
be
unable
to
avoid
it
by
its
own
conduct.
there
are
approximately
800
of
these
contract
jails
in
the
country,
housing
any
given
day
some-4,000
prisoners.
the
united
states
has
no
authority
to
place
a
federal
officer
in
each
of
these
jails
to
supervise
the
physical
conduct
of
the
jail’s
operations,
and
i
don’t
think
the
states
would
permit
it
even
if
they
had
the
authority
to
do
it.
and
even
if
there
were
such
authority,
the
burden
would
be
immense.
we’re
informed
that
in
order
to
man
a
jail
round
the
clock
with
just
one
federal
employee
would
require
five
employees
per
prison,
taking
into
account
vacations,
holidays,
and
weekends,
and
so
forth.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
the
contract
in
this
case
is
in
volume
3
of
the
appendix
at
page
38
in
the
following.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
the
argument
is
foreclosed
by
the
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
and
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
act
itself,
the
provisions
of
which
are
set
forth
on
page
41
of
our
brief
and
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
indicated,
applies
only
to
negligence
committed
by
an
employee
of
the
government.
this
court,
as
recently
as
last
term
in
melvin--
laird
against
nelms
held
that
the
requirement
is
of
negligence
of
a
government
employee
and
it
has
to
be
of
a
government
employee.
there’s
no
liability
without
fault
in
this
case
and
that’s,
in
essence,
what
a--
under
the
statute
and
that’s,
in
essence,
what
a
non-delegable
duty
amounts
to.
even
if
a
single
federal
employee
could
be
stationed
in
each
of
these
contract
jails
to
ensure
that
federal
prisoners
are
handled
properly,
it
would
be
impossible,
i
think,
for
an
officer
who
has
no
authority
to
hire,
fire,
discipline,
or
train
the
employees
he
was
supervising
to
effectively
deal
with
the
problem
and,
in
effect,
the
government
would
be
what
mr.
deanda
said
he
was
not
urging
and
they
would
be
namely
ensured
of
the
safety
of
the
federal
prisoners,
and
i
don’t
think
that
congress
intended
that
result
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
sir,
but
the
argument
is--
at
this
point,
quite
different,
not
directed
specifically
to
the
decision
to
remove
the
man
from
the
hospital.
that’s
the
tentative.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
sir,
i’m
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that’s
right.
the
act
itself
provides
for
two
possible
grounds,
under
which
the
jail’s
employees
could
conceivably
be
viewed
as
federal
employees
for
purposes
of
the
act.
one
is
that
the
jail
is,
in
effect,
a
federal
agency
for
purpose
of
dealing
with
federal
prisoners.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
foreclosed
by
the
provision
mr.
chief
justice
burger
mentioned
a
little
while
ago
that
excludes
contractors.
it’s
quite
plain
that
this
is
a
contractor
that
factions
as
an
independent
contractor
over
whose
employees
the
federal
government
has
no
control.
that
is
the
standard
under
texas
law
for
whether
a
master-servant
relationship
exists.
second,
they
argue
or
they
have
an
argument
that,
nonetheless,
the
jail’s
employees
are
in
effect
employees
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
which
is,
obviously,
a
federal
agency
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
that
provide
for--
that
define
federal
employees
as
those
who
act
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
official
capacity,
temporarily
in
the
service
of
the
united
states.
but,
in
our
view,
that
provision
is
only
limited
to
those
people
who--
over
whom
the
united
states
does
have
a
right
to
control,
and
an
example
of
the
kind
of
provision--
the
kind
of
situations
it
recover
is
where
you
have
a
dollar-a-year
man
serving
without
pay
or
where
you
have
a
loaned-servant
from
a
state
or
where
you
have
a
member
of
a
presidential
commission
himself,
where
all
these
people
are
under
control
of
the
government,
but
they’re
not
employees,
so
to
speak.
finally,
i
think
i
ought
to
address
the
point
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
alluded
to.
a
holding
in
our
favor
in
this
case
would
not
foreclose
a
remedy
for
people
in
logue’s
situation.
at
the
time
of
logue’s
death,
there
was
a
sovereign
immunity
that
would
protected
the
county
and
the
state,
but
the
sheriff
was
personally
liable
as
in--
and
is
liable
for
the
acts
of
his
deputies,
namely
the
county
jailers,
and
it’s
not
an
empty
remedy
because
the
sheriff
is
bonded
in
amounts
between
$5,000
and
$30,000
under
texas
state
statutes.
and,
the
decisions
in
texas
have
held
that
the
surety
must
pay
for
the--
for
negligent
acts
of
a
sheriff’s
deputy.
so
in
addition
to
the
state
remedy,
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
remedy
under
the
civil
rights
act,
section
1983
of
title
42,
which
provides
that
anyone
who
is
injured
by
a
state
officer
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
to
deprive
of
the
man
of
his
federal
rights
will
be
liable
to
civil
cause
of
action.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
mr.
deanda
addressed
himself
to
remedy
against
the
county
or
the
state.
well,
i’m
addressing
myself--
i
agree
that
there’s
no--
was
no,
i’m
not
claiming
that
the
tort
claims
act
in
texas
did
not
wave
that
immunity
as
to
governmental
units,
but
i’m
addressing
myself
specifically
to
the
sheriffs
and
his
deputies
who
are
personally
liable
under
the
texas
law.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
thank
you.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
position,
simply
stated,
is
this.
first,
although
the
united
states
would
be
liable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
injury
to
a
federal
prisoner
caused
by
the
negligence
by
a
federal
marshal,
the
deputy
marshals
here
acted
reasonably,
in
accord
with
due
care
and
they
violated
no
duty
owed
to
regan
logue.
second,
because
the
united
states
had
no
right
to
control
the
physical
conduct
of
the
jailers
employed
by
the
county
jail,
the
government
cannot
be
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
injury
resulting
from
the
negligent
conduct
of
those
employees.
i
think,
in
light
of
mr.
deanda’s
argument
that
it
might
be
fruitful
to
start
with
a
focus
on
the
precise
findings
that
the
district
court
made
for
the
respect
of
both
of
these
points.
they
appear
in
volume
2
of
the
appendix
at
pages
608
and
609.
the
important
point
to
make,
i
think,
is
that
the
only
federal
officer
whom
the
district
court
found
to
be
negligent
was
deputy
bowers,
that
is
the
deputy
who
was
on
the
scene
in
corpus
christi,
and
his
negligence,
in
the
court’s
view,
consisted
solely
in
the--
of
failing
to
make
“specific
arrangements”
for
logue’
s
surveillance
while
he
was
confined
to
the
jail.
there
is
no
finding
that
bowers
was
negligent
in
removing
logue
from
the
hospital
and,
as
mr.
deanda
stated
here,
the
district
court
found
that
to
be
a
discretionary
act
and
that
matter
was
not
argued
on
appeal.
moreover,
there’s
no
finding
that
any
other
federal
officer
was
negligent
in
any
way.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
page
608
and
609
of
volume
2.
second,
at
the
top
of
page
609,
the
district
court
found
that
the
jail’s
employees
were
negligent
in
failing
to
provide
adequate
surveillance
while
logue
was
confined
in
the
jail.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
the
district
court’s
findings
of
fact.
that
is,
it
did
not
disagree
that
bowers
had
failed
to
make
specific
arrangements
for
logue’s
surveillance.
it
held,
however,
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
failure
did
not
violate
any
duty
owed
to
logue.
in
our
view,
the
record
fully
supports
this
holding
because
it
shows
that
the
specific
arrangements
for
logue’s
surveillance,
that
is,
the
arrangements
that
bowers
failed
personally
to
make
were,
in
fact,
made
by
bowers’
supervisor,
deputy
jones.
i
think
a
little
background
might
be
helpful.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
knowing
that
a
man
is
eminently
suicidal
as
they
did
here,
that
they
had
a
duty
to
take
precautions
to
ensure
that
he
did
not
commit
suicide
while
he
was
in
the
jail.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record
whether
the
marshall
was
aware
of
the
type
of
bandage
that
have
been
placed
on
the
man’s
arm.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
he
saw
it
but
the
bandage--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
could’ve
been,
so
far
as
it
can
be
told
from
the
record
that
it
wasn’t
clear
whether
it
was
a
gauze
with
tape
or
whether
it
was
a
wraparound
bandage,
as
in
fact
it
was.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
he
knew
that
it
was
a
bandage
on
the
arm,
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
he
did.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
he
could’ve
left
him
in
the
hospital.
the
decision
was
made
to
remove
him
from
the
hospital
because
of
the
laps
of
time
that
would
be
necessary
to--
before
he
could
be
transported
to
the
springfield
missouri
medical
center
for
federal
prisoners
where
the
district
court
in
loreto
had
ordered
him
to
be
sent
or
was
about
to
order
him
to
be
sent.
the
order
had
not
yet
been
signed
when
he
had
been
removed
from
the
hospital.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
sir.
he
was
not
being
treated.
he
was
being
held
there
for
his
safety
but
he
was
not
under
medical
treatment
at
the
time.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
he
was
under--
he
had
been
given
a
tranquilizer
at
the
time
of
his
admission.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
because
he
was
psychotic.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
does.
the
marshal
was
very
conscientious.
the
deputy
on
the
scene,
deputy
bowers,
was
very
conscientious
to
find
out
what
the
purpose
of
mr.
logue’s
confinement
and
hospitalization.
he
discussed
it
both
with
the
admitting
physician
and
with
the
physician
who
took
over
the
case,
a
psychiatrist.
and,
the
information
he
was
given
was
that
the
man
was
hospitalized
because
he
was
suicidal
and
there
was
some
danger
that
he
might
hurt
himself.
there
was--
he
is
not
any
longer
hospitalized
for
any
physical
or
medical
treatment
purposes.
at
that
point,
the
question
came
up
when
there
was
going
to
be
a
laps
of
time
before
he
was
going
to
be
transferred
to
springfield,
what
to
do
with
him
in
the
meantime.
the
marshal
on
the
scene,
deputy
bowers,
was
concerned
that
the
security
in
the
hospital
was
inadequate
and
he
communicated
that
concern
to
his
superior.
his
superior
said
“well,
let’s
see
if
we
can
make
some
kind
of
safe
arrangements
with
the
jail
and,
if
we
can
and
if
the
doctor
will
release
him,
let’s
move
him
to
the
jail.”
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
was
a
guard
fulltime
while
mr.
logue
was
in
the
hospital
but,
i
must
add,
the
record
shows
that
the,
what
marshals
refer
to
as,
key
control
was
very
loose
and,
of
course,
the
man
in
a
psychotic
state
is
not
inconceivable
that
he
can
take
over
a
single
guard.
the
kind
of
surveillance,
a
man
was
sitting
outside
the
room,
as
i
understand
it.
there
was
a
window
to
the
room
and,
every
now
and
then,
he’d
look.
but,
there
was--
if
you
have
a
situation
where
a
key
control
is
loose
where
a
man
is
psychotic,
there’s
always
a
chance
that
he
can
be
overtaken.
the
judgment,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
marshal’s
superiors
was
that,
where
the
security
is
adequate,
it
would
be
best
if
possible
and
if
the
doctor
would
release
the
man,
to
put
him
back
in
the
jail.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
his--
the
principal
point,
and
the
marshals
reiterated
this
during
the
trial,
was
the
man’s
health
and
safety,
but--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s--
the
point
was
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
be
in
the
hospital,
safe
to
protect
himself
from
injuring
himself.
and,
the
marshals
had,
i
think,
reasonably
assured
themselves
that
he
would
be
protected
against
injuring
himself
if
he
were
placed
back
in
the
jail.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there’s
no
other
need
for
him
to
be
in
the
hospital.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
understood
him
to
say
the
same
thing.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
leads
only
to--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right
and,
as
i
was
suggesting
before,
i
think
that
the
marshals
did
undertake
that
duty
and
did
satisfy
it.
it
turned
out
that
they
didn’t
foresee
every
possibility
but,
in
our
view,
they
did
satisfy
that
they
had
under
the
circumstances.
and,
i
think
the
circumstances
are
important
to
have
clearly
in
mind.
it
was
at
the
suggestion
of
logue’s
physician
in
the
hospital
and
with
the
help
of
logue’s
attorney
that
bowers,
that’s
the
deputy
on
the
scene
again,
had
arranged
for
the
court
order
committing
logue
to
springfield,
missouri
for
a
competency
determination
and
also
for
his
safekeeping
during
this
period
of
his
psychosis.
as
i
indicated
before,
it
was
because
of
a
laps
of
time
that
was
to
be
involved
that
they
determined
that
there--
something
had
to
be
done
with
him
in
the
meantime
and
the
determination
was
made
for
reasons
that
i
think
were
satisfactory
in
the
record
but
are,
in
any
event,
are
within
the
discretionary
function
aspect
of
the
act,
that
they
ought
to
keep
him
at
the
jail
rather
than
at
the
hospital
if
the
jail’s
facilities
could
be
adequately
prepared
for
a
man
in
this
person’s
condition.
deputy
bower’s
supervisor,
deputy
jones
who
was
located
in
loreto,
telephoned
the
chief
jailer
of
the
nueces
county
jail.
he
explained
the
situation
in
some
detail,
indicated
that
the
man
was
suicidal,
and
asked
whether
there
were--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
sir.
there
were--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s
important
only
in
the
sense
that
he
did
not
resolve
those
facts
against
us,
as
mr.
deanda
suggested.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
this,
in
our
view,
is
in
the
essence
of
what
the
court
of
appeals’
holding
was.
in
essence,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that,
in
light
of
all
the
circumstances
in
the
record,
the
failure
of
deputy
bowers
by
himself
was
not
a
bridge
of
any
duty
because
the
duty
had
already
been
satisfied,
in
effect,
by
his
superior
and
satisfied
by
bowers
because
bowers
was
aware
that
the
duty
had
already
been
satisfied
by
his
superior.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that’s
a
reasonable
interpretation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
significance
is
that
bowers’
superior,
supervisor
deputy
jones--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i’m
just
relating
him
as
what
his
function
was
in
the
operation.
there’s
no
significance
to
his
being
a
superior.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
we
might
be
here
anyway,
but
i
wouldn’t
be
making
the
same
arguments.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
reason
that--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
absent
jones’
conversation,
i
might
make
an
argument
on
the
record,
mr.
justice,
that
he
was
not
negligent
but
i
think
that
we
would
be
bound
and
the
court
of
appeals
will
be
bound
by
the
findings
made
by
the
district
court.
but
my
point,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
answer
your
question,
is
that
the
finding
as
to
what
bowers
did
and
did
not
do,
in
the
court
of
appeals’
view,
did
not--
the
finding
that
the
district
court
made
did
not
constitute
negligence
because
there
was
no
duty
that
was
breached
thereby.
in
other
words,
the
legal
question
is
to
what
duty
was
required
of
deputy
bowers.
it
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
addressing
its
attention
to,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
that’s--
well,
that’s
not
exactly
right.
bowers
was
made
aware
by
deputy
jones
about
the
conversation
with
the
jailer.
jones
directed
bowers,
since
he
was
on
the
scene,
to
inspect
the
cell
and
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
adequately
prepared
and
that
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
with
the
jailer
would
be
carried
out,
and
he
did
so.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i’m
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
mr.
justice,
i
agree
that
we
are
not
suggesting
that
deputy
bowers
made
specific
arrangements
for
the
surveillance
of--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
we
are
suggesting
that
deputy
bowers
was--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
even
though
the
district
court
found
that
he
had
failed
to
make
specific
arrangements
and
that
that
was
not
negligent.
we
agree
that
he
had
failed
to
make
specific
arrangement,
but
we
do
not
agree
that
he
was
negligent
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
held
that
there
was
no
duty
to
make
those
specific
arrangements
into
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don’t
believe
any
of
the
marshals
themselves
were
made
part
of
it.
i
think
it
was
a
suite
that’s
just
against
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
certainly,
because
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
supervisor
made
the
necessary
arrangements
with
the
jailer
of
the
county
jail.
what
he
told
the
county
jailer
was
the
man
was
suicidal.
“you’d
have
to
prepare
a
special
cell.
take
out
everything
from
that
cell
that
a
man
could
possibly
use
to
hurt
himself.
when
he’s
brought
back
to
the
jail,
strip
him
down
to
his
shorts
and
keep
someone
watching
him.”
now,
he
specifically
suggested
to
satisfy
the
observation
part
of
his
suggestion
that
his
one
or
two
trustees,
that
his
favored
inmates
be
placed
either
in
the
cell
with
the
prisoner
or
right
outside
where
they
could
watch
him
continually.
now
in
those
circumstances,
if
his
instructions
had
been
carried
out
and,
incidentally,
the
chief
jailer
expressly
agreed
and
indicated
that
he
would
carry
out
those
instructions
and
suggestions,
if
they
had
been
carried
out,
it
would
have
been,
i
won’t
say
impossible
for
the
man
to
commit
suicide
because
it’s
never--
you
can
try
to
say
when
a
man
is--
truly
intends
to
commit
suicide,
that
it
would
have
been
possible
for
him
to
do
it.
it
would’ve
been
much
more
difficult
under
the
circumstances.
our
point,
basically,
is
that
if
there
was
a
failure
here,
the
failure
was
not
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
federal
marshals
involved,
all
them
acted
reasonably,
but
rather
on
the
part
of
the
county
jailer.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
that
was
jones.
jones
had
the
telephone
conversation
with
the
chief
jailer
in
which
he
made
these
specific
arrangements.
bowers,
at
jones’
instructions,
personally
visited
the
jail,
inspected
the
cell,
assured
himself
that
all
dangerous
objects
had
been
removed,
determined
that
it
was
convenient
for
observation
by
the
jail
authorities.
and,
later,
when
he
brought
logue
to
the
jail,
he
again
inspected
it,
again
determined
it
was
safe,
had
a
conversation
evidently
with
the
jailers
there,
instructed
them
again
as
to
what
need
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
surveillance,
and
left.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
only
dispute
was
that
the
chief
jailer
of
the
nueces
county
jail
testified.
i
characterize
his
testimony
as
somewhat
hazy,
but
it
made
up
maybe
a
subjective
view
of
it.
his
memory
was
only
that
he
did
what
he
thought
he’d
been
told
to
do
which
was
to
have
the
man
placed
in
his
cell,
but
to
check
him
only
periodically.
what
they
had
done
is--
the
chief
jailer
and
his
staff,
when
they
had
business
on
the
second
floor
of
the
jail
where
logue
was
confined,
would
look
in
on
him.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i’m
not
sure
i
could
answer
that--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there’s
an
easy
answer,
but
it’s
in--
the
proposed
findings
are
in
the
appendix.
i’m
not
familiar
enough
with
them
at
this
point
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right,
i’m
in
total--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
have--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
page?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s--
i
agree
that
it’s
not
explicitly
rested
on
that,
mr.
justice,
but
in
my
view,
the
final
sentence
of
the
paragraph
you’ve
just
read
is
the
sentence
i’m
focusing
on
and
i’m
supporting
that
by
the
reasoning
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
make
explicit.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
well,
that
may
be
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
it.
i
think
what--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
we
agreed
that
bowers
had
a
duty.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
what
the
court--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
case
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it’s
not
clear
from
this
opinion
that
they--
the
reasoning
that
underlies
its
decision
is
the
same
reason
that
i’m
urging
on
this
court,
but
i
don’t
think
that
we
are
foreclosed
for
making
the
argument
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
would
say
that
it,
in
a
sense,
involves
a
factual
assessment
that
is--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it’s
not
a
constitutional
assessment.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i’m
not
sure
that
this--
the
assessment
that
his--
it’s
not
clear,
that’s
been
made
wasn’t,
in
fact,
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
necessary
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
expressly
stated
that
it
was
viewing
the
facts.
as
i’m
suggesting,
the
facts
could
be
viewed.
the
record
is
there.
it’s
basically
undisputed
and,
in
my
view,
it
can
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
supported
by
viewing
the
record
as
it
stands.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
summarily
affirmed
or
summarily
reversed
without
opinion
in
a
case
like
this,
i
think
we
could
be
here
making
the
same
argument.
i
don’t
think
that
the
failure
to
express
precisely
the
reason
that
we’re
urging
is
fatal.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
don’t
see
the
problems,
but--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
we
can
surmise
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
aware
of
what
was
in
the
record,
and
that
was
clearly
in
the
record.
i
don’t
know
that
it’s--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
don’t--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
the--
that’s
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
had
in
mind
was
that
the--
to
their
view,
the
district
court
was
suggesting
that
the
specific
arrangements
that
bowers
neglected
to
make
or
failed
to
make
would’ve
required
him
personally
to
stand
in
the
jail
and
watch
the
prisoner
and
i
think,
in
essence,
what
they
were
saying
was
he
had
no
duty
to
do
that.
but,
as
i
said,
i
think
that
the
judgment
can
be
supported
on
the
reason
i’m
urging
even
though
they
haven’t
made
it
as
explicit
as
i
have.
i
think
the--
to
turn
to
the
second
point
here
which
has
to
do
with
whether
assuming
the
marshals
themselves
were
not
negligent,
the
united
states
is
nonetheless
liable
for
the
torts
of
the
jail’s
employees.
in
our
view,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
forecloses
that
kind
of
derivative
liability,
and
the
government
is
liable
because
the
government
is
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
only
for
the
torts
of
federal
employees.
the
wisdom
of
that
limitation
is
plain.
if
the
united
states
were
held
liable
for
the
torts
of
the
county
jailers
over
whom
the
government
can
exercise
no
direct
supervision,
the
government
would
face
a
potentially
large
financial
burden
and
it
would
be
unable
to
avoid
it
by
its
own
conduct.
there
are
approximately
800
of
these
contract
jails
in
the
country,
housing
any
given
day
some-4,000
prisoners.
the
united
states
has
no
authority
to
place
a
federal
officer
in
each
of
these
jails
to
supervise
the
physical
conduct
of
the
jail’s
operations,
and
i
don’t
think
the
states
would
permit
it
even
if
they
had
the
authority
to
do
it.
and
even
if
there
were
such
authority,
the
burden
would
be
immense.
we’re
informed
that
in
order
to
man
a
jail
round
the
clock
with
just
one
federal
employee
would
require
five
employees
per
prison,
taking
into
account
vacations,
holidays,
and
weekends,
and
so
forth.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
the
contract
in
this
case
is
in
volume
3
of
the
appendix
at
page
38
in
the
following.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
the
argument
is
foreclosed
by
the
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
and
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
act
itself,
the
provisions
of
which
are
set
forth
on
page
41
of
our
brief
and
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
indicated,
applies
only
to
negligence
committed
by
an
employee
of
the
government.
this
court,
as
recently
as
last
term
in
melvin--
laird
against
nelms
held
that
the
requirement
is
of
negligence
of
a
government
employee
and
it
has
to
be
of
a
government
employee.
there’s
no
liability
without
fault
in
this
case
and
that’s,
in
essence,
what
a--
under
the
statute
and
that’s,
in
essence,
what
a
non-delegable
duty
amounts
to.
even
if
a
single
federal
employee
could
be
stationed
in
each
of
these
contract
jails
to
ensure
that
federal
prisoners
are
handled
properly,
it
would
be
impossible,
i
think,
for
an
officer
who
has
no
authority
to
hire,
fire,
discipline,
or
train
the
employees
he
was
supervising
to
effectively
deal
with
the
problem
and,
in
effect,
the
government
would
be
what
mr.
deanda
said
he
was
not
urging
and
they
would
be
namely
ensured
of
the
safety
of
the
federal
prisoners,
and
i
don’t
think
that
congress
intended
that
result
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
sir,
but
the
argument
is--
at
this
point,
quite
different,
not
directed
specifically
to
the
decision
to
remove
the
man
from
the
hospital.
that’s
the
tentative.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
sir,
i’m
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that’s
right.
the
act
itself
provides
for
two
possible
grounds,
under
which
the
jail’s
employees
could
conceivably
be
viewed
as
federal
employees
for
purposes
of
the
act.
one
is
that
the
jail
is,
in
effect,
a
federal
agency
for
purpose
of
dealing
with
federal
prisoners.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
foreclosed
by
the
provision
mr.
chief
justice
burger
mentioned
a
little
while
ago
that
excludes
contractors.
it’s
quite
plain
that
this
is
a
contractor
that
factions
as
an
independent
contractor
over
whose
employees
the
federal
government
has
no
control.
that
is
the
standard
under
texas
law
for
whether
a
master-servant
relationship
exists.
second,
they
argue
or
they
have
an
argument
that,
nonetheless,
the
jail’s
employees
are
in
effect
employees
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
which
is,
obviously,
a
federal
agency
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
that
provide
for--
that
define
federal
employees
as
those
who
act
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
official
capacity,
temporarily
in
the
service
of
the
united
states.
but,
in
our
view,
that
provision
is
only
limited
to
those
people
who--
over
whom
the
united
states
does
have
a
right
to
control,
and
an
example
of
the
kind
of
provision--
the
kind
of
situations
it
recover
is
where
you
have
a
dollar-a-year
man
serving
without
pay
or
where
you
have
a
loaned-servant
from
a
state
or
where
you
have
a
member
of
a
presidential
commission
himself,
where
all
these
people
are
under
control
of
the
government,
but
they’re
not
employees,
so
to
speak.
finally,
i
think
i
ought
to
address
the
point
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
alluded
to.
a
holding
in
our
favor
in
this
case
would
not
foreclose
a
remedy
for
people
in
logue’s
situation.
at
the
time
of
logue’s
death,
there
was
a
sovereign
immunity
that
would
protected
the
county
and
the
state,
but
the
sheriff
was
personally
liable
as
in--
and
is
liable
for
the
acts
of
his
deputies,
namely
the
county
jailers,
and
it’s
not
an
empty
remedy
because
the
sheriff
is
bonded
in
amounts
between
$5,000
and
$30,000
under
texas
state
statutes.
and,
the
decisions
in
texas
have
held
that
the
surety
must
pay
for
the--
for
negligent
acts
of
a
sheriff’s
deputy.
so
in
addition
to
the
state
remedy,
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
remedy
under
the
civil
rights
act,
section
1983
of
title
42,
which
provides
that
anyone
who
is
injured
by
a
state
officer
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
to
deprive
of
the
man
of
his
federal
rights
will
be
liable
to
civil
cause
of
action.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
mr.
deanda
addressed
himself
to
remedy
against
the
county
or
the
state.
well,
i’m
addressing
myself--
i
agree
that
there’s
no--
was
no,
i’m
not
claiming
that
the
tort
claims
act
in
texas
did
not
wave
that
immunity
as
to
governmental
units,
but
i’m
addressing
myself
specifically
to
the
sheriffs
and
his
deputies
who
are
personally
liable
under
the
texas
law.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
thank
you.
