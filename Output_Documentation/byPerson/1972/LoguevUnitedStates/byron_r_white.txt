justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you’re
saying
that
the
specific
conduct
of
this
federal
marshal
in
these
circumstances
was,
itself,
negligent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
could
be
true
even
if
the
conduct
of
the
jailer
that
he--
into
whose
custody
he
delivered
the
man
was
not
negligent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
true
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
absent
this
conduct
of
this
particular
federal
marshal.
you
weren’t
asserting
that
the
united
states
would
automatically
be
liable
just
because
the
jailer
was
negligent,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don’t
need
to
get
to
that
if
the
marshal’s
duty--
marshal’s
specific
conduct
here
was
negligent
in
itself.
justice
byron

himself
was
negligent.
justice
byron

well,
that’s
the--
but
you
conceded
a
moment
ago,
i
thought
that
bowers
had
a
duty.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
the
court
of
appeals
hasn’t
considered
the
case
on
the
legal
basis
that
you
now
are
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
said
made
it
irrelevant,
what
was
in
the
record.
