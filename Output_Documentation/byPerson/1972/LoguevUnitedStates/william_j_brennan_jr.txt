justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
an
argument
that
even
if
the
state
official--
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
jail
or
prison
was
one
of
independent
contractor,
even
if
it
was,
that
under
these
circumstances
it
was
negligent
for
the
marshal
to
have
lodged
the
man
there
without
first
making
certain
that
whatever
the
independent
contractor
did,
he
did
to
safeguard
this
fellow
from
committing--
attempting
suicide
again.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
the
marshal
had
any
choice
but--
when
he
was
released
from
the
hospital
to
put
him
in
this
very
jail?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
could
he
have
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
locally,
were
the
choices
either
to
leave
him
in
the
hospital
or
put
him
in
this
jail?
did
he
have
any
other
options,
the
marshal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
did
exist
a
contract
with
this
jail
to
take
these
federal
prisoners,
didn’t
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
that
did
rather
limit
the
marshal’s
options,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
understand
it,
mr.
evans.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
set
of
facts
subject
of
any
finding
of
the
district
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
important?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he
did
find
that
there
was
no
specific
arrangement
made
by
bowers
with
respect
to
certain
things,
and
you’re
saying
that
if
there
was
a
deficiency
that
was
made
up
by
jones,
but
we
haven’t
any
findings
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don’t
follow
this,
mr.
evans.
the
specific
finding
of
the
district
judge
was
that
the
failure
of
bowers
to
make
specific
arrangements
for
constant
surveillance
constituted
negligence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now--
and
you
now
say
that,
what,
as
to
the
telephone
conversation
between
the
jailer
and
jones?
what’s
the
significance
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what’s
the
significance
of
his
being
supervisor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
jones’
conversations
had
not
taken
place,
you
wouldn’t
be
here,
i
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
you
would--
you
don’t
concede
then
that--
you
don’t
concede
that
whatever
it
was
that
bowers
did
by
himself
was
negligent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
absent
of
jones’
conversation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
everything
that
jones
did
satisfy
any
duty
and
no
matter
what
bowers
did
was
immaterial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
now--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
don’t
un--
what
are
you
doing
with
this
finding
that
whatever
bowers
did
or
failed
to
do
constituted
negligence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
deputy
bowers
was
not
negligent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
district
court
found
that
he
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
evans,
what--from
the
beginning
and
again
in
this
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
jones
is
nowhere
mentioned,
nowhere.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what--
how
do
you--
look
at
page

would
you
please,
of
the
opinion.
