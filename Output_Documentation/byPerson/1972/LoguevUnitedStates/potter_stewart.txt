justice
potter
stewart
mr.
deanda,
i’d
rather
understood
your
alternative
position
to
be
this.
the
district
court
found
that
deputy
bowers
was
negligent,
that
he
failed
to
make
adequate
specific
arrangements
for
the
care
and
surveillance
of
the
decedent
in
the
jail,
and
that
was
met
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
finding
that
he
had
no
power
to
make
any
such
specific
arrangements
for
the
surveillance
inside
the
jail,
and
i
thought
that
if
one
should
accept
that
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that,
in
fact,
the
marshal
had
no
power
whatsoever
to
control
or
to
arrange
or
to
provide
for
the
proper
kind
of
surveillance
in
the
jail.
then,
indeed,
it
was
negligence
for
him
to
turn
him
over
to
the
jail--
justice
potter
stewart
to
a
situation
where
he
had
no
control
to—over
the
proper
kind
of
surveillance
that
the
man
was
going
to
be
given.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
that’s
true,
then
it
wasn’t
negligence,
in
your
submission,
for
him
to
turn
him
over
to
a
jail
where
he
had
no
control
over
what
was
going
to
happen
inside
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
was--
if
he
did
have
the
power
to
make
arrangements,
he
was
negligent
on
your
submission
in
not
making
the
proper
arrangements,
and
that’s
what
the
district
court
found.
justice
potter
stewart
if
on
the
other
hand,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
he
did
not
have
any
power
to
influence
what
arrangements
were
made
inside
the
jail,
then
he
was
negligent
in
putting
this
man,
knowing
his
condition
and
his
propensity
to
commit
suicide,
into
that
jail
which
he
had
no
power
to
control.
is
that
it,
alternatively?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
on
this
branch
of
the
case
as
to
other
branches.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
interested
in
your
comment
about
the
government’s
suggestion
as
between
deputy
bowers
and
deputy
jones?
as
i
understand,
there
were
two
involved.
i
think
the
government’s
argument
is
that
whatever
bowers
did
or
did
not
do
that
jones
made
up
for
it
with
specific
and
definitive
instructions
to
the
jailer.
do
you
have
any
comment
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
he
used
the
bandage?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
use
the
bandage?
justice
potter
stewart
the
kerlix
bandage,
whatever
that
means.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
suicides
take
place
in
hospitals
too.
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
you’re
not
pinning
your
case
on
the
removal
to
the
jail.
you
regard
this
as
a
discretionary
act.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
there
would
have
been
a
duty
to--
for
the
federal
government
to
have
made
some
arrangements
when
they
delivered
the
prisoner
to
the
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
they
had
at
least
a
duty
to
stay
in
that
to
the
contractee.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you’re
saying
that
having
a
contractee
insulates
the
united
states
from
liability
to
the
contractee,
you
are
not
saying
that
the
united
states
must
not
tell
a
contractee
what
his
duty
is.
justice
potter
stewart
by
jones.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought,
mr.
evans,
i
understood
mr.
deanda
to
say
there
was
no
remedy
under
state
law.
perhaps
you
can--
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
he
can
clarify
that
on
rebuttal.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
thought
there
was
no
adequate
remedy
under
state
law
as
against
these
county
jailers.
justice
potter
stewart
under
that
act,
but
would
there
be--
justice
potter
stewart
one
way
or
the
other.
but,
in
any
event,
the
texas’
equivalent
of
the
tort
claims
act
would
exempt
this
kind
of
a
contention.
justice
potter
stewart
thanks.
justice

mr.
