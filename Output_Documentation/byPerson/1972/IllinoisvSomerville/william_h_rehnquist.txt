justice

rehnquist
mr.
gildea,
under
illinois
law
had
the
trial
in
the
first
indictment
proceeded
and
resulted
in
a
judgment
of
conviction,
could
that
have
been
collaterally
attacked
in
illinois
courts
and
the
prisoner
released?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
alwin,
doesn't
the
illinois
law
will
carry
some
safeguards
against
this
type
of
abuse,
if
under
an
invalid
indictment,
the
defendant
can,
not
only
get
his
conviction
reversed
on
appeal
also
his
state
doesn't
bring
it
up
with
the
trial,
but
actually
get
collaterally
released
after
judgments
become
final?
there
certainly
isn't
much
incentive
for
the
state
to
put
in
deliberately
a
defect
in
the
indictment
thinking
if
the
trail
goes
badly,
we
will
use
it,
if
not,
we
will
forget
about
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
he
knows
it's
subject
to
a
collateral
attack?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
it
is.
when
you
are
talking
about
whether
some
will
be
reversed
or
not,
that
always
ends
up
as
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court
as
to
whether
the
thing
was
not
only
erroneous
but
also
prejudicial,
but
here
you
presumably,
you
start
the
trial
with
the
opening
day,
with
an
indictment
that
is
demonstrably
bad
and
will
entitle
this
man
to
be
released
from
any
judgment
of
conviction
without
anybody's
assessment
of
prejudicial
error
or
the
like.
i
would
think
those
are
different
situations.
