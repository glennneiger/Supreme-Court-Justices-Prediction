and
yet,
you
do
concede
that
in
this
case,
by
contrast
to
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question,
respecting
a
non-judge
that
in
this
case,
since
there
had
been
a
verdict
of
acquittal,
the
state
would
have
been
barred
from
trying
this
person
again?
justice

stewart
so,
there
is
a
difference
apparently
in
the
two
cases,
in
the
cases
between
the
case
of
acquittal
on
a
non
indictment
and
a
trail
by
a
non
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
in
one
case
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
a
properly
constituted
court
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
personal
jurisdiction
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
is
a
proper
constituted
court
and
you
know
i
suppose
there
is
no
court
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
the
citation
on
the
ewell
case?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
really,
that's
what
the
ball
case
does
stand
for,
doesn't
it?
