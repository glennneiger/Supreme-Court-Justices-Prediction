mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
justice
harlan
stated
in
his
opinion
in
the
jorn
case,
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
a
constitutional
policy
of
finality
for
the
defendant's
benefit.
here,
that
policy
was
violated,
where
the
defendant
was
put
to
trial
once
on
a
invalid
indictment
and
then
re-indicted
and
put
to
trial
again
on
the
subsequent
valid
indictment.
we
have
in
the
history
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
a
two
constellations
of
cases
if
you
will.
we
have
the
perez
case
and
the
cases
along
the
line
of
following
perez
under
different
circumstances
where
this
court
is
held
that
the
trial
maybe
aborted
by
the
trial
judge
without
the
consent
of
the
defendant,
where
there
is
a
manifest
necessity
for
doing
so,
where
there
is
a
breakdown
in
the
judicial
machinery.
those
are
the
words
used
by
the
court.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
another
constellation
of
cases,
the
downum
case,
the
jorn
case,
the
green
case,
i
think
belongs
in
that
category,
where
the
court
has
held
that
the
trial
cannot
be
aborted
without
the
defendant
having
him
placed
in
jeopardy
and
i
hasten
to
add
that
sometimes
jeopardy
is
a
conclusion.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
trial,
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
retried
after
the
first
trial
was
aborted.
to
get
to
the
question
now
before
the
court,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
they
--
the
existence
here
of
a
defective
indictment
takes
this
case
out
of
the
classic
mold,
which
the
general
rule
applies,
to
which
the
general
rule
applies.
the
respondent
submits
that
it
does
not.
i
would
like
to
look
at
some
of
the
circumstances
here,
which
this
court
has
considered
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
re-prosecution
would
be
barred.
admittedly
now,
these
circumstances
are
not
a
--
are
not
each
in
and
of
themselves
determinant,
but
they
all
go
into
the
double
jeopardy
equation
and
one
of
the
first
circumstances
we
have
here
is
that
neither
the
mistrial
nor
the
defective
indictment
was
caused
by
the
defendant.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
tateo
case
where
the
court
found
that
the
mistrial
was
caused
by
the
defendant,
the
guilty
plea
in
that
instance,
not
a
mistrial,
and
the
defendant
also
subsequently,
by
a
2255
proceeding
attacked
the
judgment
of
conviction.
similarly,
in
the
ewell
case,
there
was
interestingly
a
bad
indictment
and
there
the
defendant
subsequently,
by
2255
proceeding
or
at
least
on
appeal,
attacked
the
judgment
of
conviction.
now,
this
court
held
that
there
was
either
a
continuing
jeopardy
as
expressed
in
price
versus
georgia,
or
the
defendant
had
waived
his
jeopardy,
whichever
theory
is
adopted
under
these
facts,
the
defendant
can
be
retried
on
a
subsequent
valid
indictment.
now
interestingly,
in
the
ewell
case,
there
was
a
bad
indictment,
but
this
court
chose
not
to
rest
its
opinion
on
the
existence
of
a
bad
indictment
for
the
proposition
urged
by
the
state
here
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
jeopardy
had
not
attached.
this
court
relied
rather
on
the
sounder
proposition
that
once
the
defendant
attacks
the
judgment
of
conviction,
his
jeopardy
has
not
somehow
concluded,
and
there
is
a
continuing
jeopardy
if
you
will.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
will
have
it
in
a
minute,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
it's
not
cited
in
brief;
it
is
cited
by
the
way
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
filed
in
the
previous
case,
when
this
case
was
up
here
before.
my
associate
would
look
for
the
citation.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
here
was
that
we
have
the
first
point
that
this
defect
was
not
caused
by
the
defendant.
importantly,
however,
it
was
caused
by
the
prosecution
and
that
distinguishes
this
case
even
from
the
jorn
case,
where
the
mistrial
was
occasioned
by
the
conduct
of
the
trial
judge.
here
we
have
the
underlying
cause,
the
material
cause
if
you
will,
the
bad
indictment
was
created
by
the
prosecution.
this
--
well,
i
would
pass
again
to
the
third
point,
what
i
call
the
official
cause
of
the
mistrial
was
the
motion
for
the
mistrial
made
by
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
again,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
jorn
case,
where
in
dissenting,
three
justices
noted
that
the
--
i'm
quoting
"the
mistrial
was
not
requested
by
the
prosecution",
this
cannot
be
said
about
this
case.
the
citation
for
the
ewell
case
is
383
us
116,
1966
case.
returning
for
the
moment
to
this
idea
that
the
cause
here
and
also
the
motion
for
the
mistrial
occasion
--
was
occasioned
by
the
prosecution's
conduct.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
concept
of
overreaching
expressed
by
justice
harlan
in
the
jorn
case.
i
think
here
we
have
overreaching.
now
overreaching,
i
would
add,
does
not
have
to
go
so
far
as
to
be
bad
faith.
it
can
be
as
justice
frankfurter
indicated
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
brock
versus
north
carolina,
it
can
be
incompetent
or
a
casual
or
ineffective
conduct
of
a
prosecutor.
i
would
also
point
out
that
it
can
be
passive
as
well
as
active
here.
in
the
downum
case,
we
have
what
might
be
termed
passive
overreaching.
the
prosecutor
didn't
have
the
witnesses
there
to
testify
against
the
defendant.
here,
apparently,
it
resulted
from
the
drafting
of
a
bad
indictment
and
the
indictments
are
drafted
by
the
state's
attorney's
office,
but
more
importantly
here,
the
state
was
actually
given
a
second
chance
to
correct
this
error
before
a
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn
and
that's
when
the
case
went
to
trial.
and
we
suggest
here
that
the
error
would
not
have
been
held
so
serious
if
the
prosecution
had
not
proceeded
to
trial
on
this
bad
indictment.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes
your
honor,
in
the
constitutional
sense,
i
do.
i
think
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
ball
case,
where
the
court
noted
the
difference
between
the
voidable
and
the
void
indictments.
i
think
there
was
jurisdiction
within
the
meaning
of
jeopardy
under
the
sixth
amendment,
although,
i
hasten
to
add
that
jurisdiction
is
sometimes
an
elusive
concept.
certainly
here,
there
was
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
in
the
cause.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
i
believe
so,
yes.
had
there
been
no
jurisdiction
there,
that
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
hold
that
the
acquittal
itself
was
invalid,
the
acquittal
could
not
have
suddenly
caused
jeopardy
to
exist
where
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
i
point
out
the
purposes
of
an
indictment
here.
there
are
two
--
at
least
two
purposes
of
the
indictment
are
to
enable
the
accused
to
prepare
a
defense
and
of
course,
to
plead
for
jeopardy.
here,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
accused
had
not
been
able
to
prepare
a
defense
and
was,
in
fact,
ready
to
go
to
trial
and
this
is
indicated
also
by
his
objection
to
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial,
which
i
would
point
out,
does
not
appear
to
be
a
token
objection.
we
don't
have
the
record
of
the
state
court
proceedings,
but
i
would
quarrel
with
the
state's
characterization
of
this
objection
as
a
token
objection.
also
supporting
the
argument
here,
of
course,
is
the
decision
in
benton
versus
maryland,
where
the
court
noted
that
the
defendant
there,
as
here,
had
not
been
--
at
the
first
trial
had
not
been
terminated,
the
defendant
could
well
have
served
out
his
time
under
this
invalid
indictment.
this,
i
think,
is
a
very
important
practical
point,
which
also
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
you
see
the
defendant
could
have
served
time
even
in
a
case
where
the
state
would
argue
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
a
decision
in
line
with
what
the
state
urges
here
would
not
take
into
account
the
practicalities
present
in
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes,
i
think
he
would
have
been,
he
could
have
been.
however,
if
it
had
later
come
to
his
attention,
then
i
think
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
courts
of
illinois,
he
could
have
had
his
conviction
vacated
by
collateral
attack.
now
the
state
argues
that
once
it
comes
to
his
attention,
this
somehow
deprives
the
judge
of
a
power
to
continue
the
trial
when
in
the
first
instance,
the
judge
didn't
have
any
power
to
continue
the
trial.
i
don't
think
this
argument
again
comports
with
the
reality.
the
mere
fact
of
knowledge
should
not
be
controlling
in
this
case.
here,
the
defendant
admittedly
with
knowledge
or
notice,
if
you
will,
after
this
defect
was
called
to
his
attention,
wanted
to
continue
with
the
trial.
now
i
ask
your
honors,
what
would
you
say
if
i
were
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
same
defendant
and
he
had
objected,
let's
say
he
had
raised
the
point
and
the
trial
have
been
terminated
on
the
defendant's
motion
and
then
a
valid
indictment
was
obtained
and
he
interposed
the
defense
of
double
jeopardy?
in
this
case,
we
are
here
today,
i
think
your
honors
would
hasten
to
point
out
to
me
that
this
mistrial
had
been
declared
under
the
defendant's
motion
and
that's
the
principle
of
the
ewell
case
and
the
tateo
case.
we
can't
take
inconsistent
positions
and
then
ask
for
relief.
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
stated
in
the
holden
case,
which
was
cited
in
the
state's
brief,
you
can't
blow
hot
and
cold.
now
that
was
a
double
jeopardy
case,
where
the
defendant
wanted
to
blow
hot
and
cold.
he
objected
to
an
invalid
indictment,
then
he
interposed
the
defense
of
double
jeopardy.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
consistent
throughout
the
proceedings.
he
objected
to
termination
of
the
trial.
he
maintained
in
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
that
the
indictment
was,
in
fact,
valid
and
i
think
obviously,
he
was
adequately
placed
upon
notice
and
he
could
prepare
a
defense
and
that's
one
of
the
essential
purposes
of
the
indictment.
another
point,
which
i
think
should
be
taken
into
consideration
here
and
i
will
make
it
only
briefly
is
the
potentiality
for
abuse.
we
do
not
argue
that
in
this
case,
there
was
an
abuse
by
the
prosecutor's
office
of
an
invalid
indictment,
but
the
potentiality
is
there,
especially
in
this
situation,
unlike
the
situation
in
united
states
versus
jorn,
for
example.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
quotation
from
people
versus
barrett
(ph)
in
the
downum
case,
which
i
think
quite
adequately
covers
that
particular
issue.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
well,
i
think
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
if
the
state
tries
an
individual
serially
enough
times,
i
think
eventually,
they
will
get
a
conviction
which
will
be
upheld.
even
this
advantage,
which
i
think
your
honors
characterize
this
slight,
but
which
i
don't
think
is
so
slight,
would
--
might
be
sufficient
for
a
prosecutor
to
take
advantage
of.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
in
the
experience
of
lawyers,
frequently
a
prosecutor
will
go
to
a
jury
with
a
case,
which
due
not
necessarily
to
a
bad
indictment,
but
due
to
very
strong
error,
he
may
suspect,
will
be
reversed.
now
in
that
situation,
he
does
not
terminate
the
trial.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
they
certainly
are
different
situations.
i
cannot
say
with
certainty
to
what
extent
this
abuse
might
be
taken
advantage
of
by
the
state's
attorney's
of
cook
county,
for
example.
if
at
all,
perhaps,
there
would
be
no
abuse
in
our
state's
attorney's
office
in
cook
county,
but
the
potentiality
is
there,
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
designed
to
guard
against.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
well,
if
it
were
to
come
to
the
defendant's
attention,
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
estopped
from
later
raising
it
if
he
chooses
in
to
go
ahead
with
the
trial.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
the
case
--
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes,
that
is
my
understanding.
i
think
the
final
point
i
would
make
here
is
that
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
go
to
this
jury.
in
answer
to
what
was
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
mr.
gildea,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
would
just
be
a
waste
of
time
for
the
state
to
continue
with
this
trial
if
the
same
would
be
reversed
on
appeal.
to
answer
there
would
be
a
waste
of
time
is
shortsighted
for
this
overlooks
the
valued
right
of
the
defendant
to
go
to
this
jury
and
by
this
confrontation
to
end
the
confrontation,
rather
with
the
state
at
this
time.
i
would
finally
point
out
that
if
your
honors
have
doubt
about
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
plea
of
double
jeopardy
should
be
sustained
as
your
honors
pointed
out
in
downum,
this
doubt
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
citizen.
in
the
final
analysis,
as
justice
harlan
stated
enjoined
with
the
judges'
decision
in
the
--
the
trial
judges'
decision
to
abort
the
trials
to
be
tempered
with
the
defendant's
right
to
go
to
this
jury,
which
has
been
selected
and
sworn
and
to
end
this
confrontation
with
the
state
right
at
that
point.
that
was
overlooked
here.
finally,
i
would
add
if
in
this
situation
it
is
a
criminal
who
must
go
free
because
as
justice
clark
stated
in
mapp
versus
ohio,
because
the
constable
is
wondered,
we
must
remember
here
that
again
as
he
stated,
it
is
the
law
that
sets
him
free.
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
justice
harlan
stated
in
his
opinion
in
the
jorn
case,
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
a
constitutional
policy
of
finality
for
the
defendant's
benefit.
here,
that
policy
was
violated,
where
the
defendant
was
put
to
trial
once
on
a
invalid
indictment
and
then
re-indicted
and
put
to
trial
again
on
the
subsequent
valid
indictment.
we
have
in
the
history
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
a
two
constellations
of
cases
if
you
will.
we
have
the
perez
case
and
the
cases
along
the
line
of
following
perez
under
different
circumstances
where
this
court
is
held
that
the
trial
maybe
aborted
by
the
trial
judge
without
the
consent
of
the
defendant,
where
there
is
a
manifest
necessity
for
doing
so,
where
there
is
a
breakdown
in
the
judicial
machinery.
those
are
the
words
used
by
the
court.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
another
constellation
of
cases,
the
downum
case,
the
jorn
case,
the
green
case,
i
think
belongs
in
that
category,
where
the
court
has
held
that
the
trial
cannot
be
aborted
without
the
defendant
having
him
placed
in
jeopardy
and
i
hasten
to
add
that
sometimes
jeopardy
is
a
conclusion.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
trial,
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
retried
after
the
first
trial
was
aborted.
to
get
to
the
question
now
before
the
court,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
they
--
the
existence
here
of
a
defective
indictment
takes
this
case
out
of
the
classic
mold,
which
the
general
rule
applies,
to
which
the
general
rule
applies.
the
respondent
submits
that
it
does
not.
i
would
like
to
look
at
some
of
the
circumstances
here,
which
this
court
has
considered
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
re-prosecution
would
be
barred.
admittedly
now,
these
circumstances
are
not
a
--
are
not
each
in
and
of
themselves
determinant,
but
they
all
go
into
the
double
jeopardy
equation
and
one
of
the
first
circumstances
we
have
here
is
that
neither
the
mistrial
nor
the
defective
indictment
was
caused
by
the
defendant.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
tateo
case
where
the
court
found
that
the
mistrial
was
caused
by
the
defendant,
the
guilty
plea
in
that
instance,
not
a
mistrial,
and
the
defendant
also
subsequently,
by
a
2255
proceeding
attacked
the
judgment
of
conviction.
similarly,
in
the
ewell
case,
there
was
interestingly
a
bad
indictment
and
there
the
defendant
subsequently,
by
2255
proceeding
or
at
least
on
appeal,
attacked
the
judgment
of
conviction.
now,
this
court
held
that
there
was
either
a
continuing
jeopardy
as
expressed
in
price
versus
georgia,
or
the
defendant
had
waived
his
jeopardy,
whichever
theory
is
adopted
under
these
facts,
the
defendant
can
be
retried
on
a
subsequent
valid
indictment.
now
interestingly,
in
the
ewell
case,
there
was
a
bad
indictment,
but
this
court
chose
not
to
rest
its
opinion
on
the
existence
of
a
bad
indictment
for
the
proposition
urged
by
the
state
here
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
jeopardy
had
not
attached.
this
court
relied
rather
on
the
sounder
proposition
that
once
the
defendant
attacks
the
judgment
of
conviction,
his
jeopardy
has
not
somehow
concluded,
and
there
is
a
continuing
jeopardy
if
you
will.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
will
have
it
in
a
minute,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
it's
not
cited
in
brief;
it
is
cited
by
the
way
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
filed
in
the
previous
case,
when
this
case
was
up
here
before.
my
associate
would
look
for
the
citation.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
here
was
that
we
have
the
first
point
that
this
defect
was
not
caused
by
the
defendant.
importantly,
however,
it
was
caused
by
the
prosecution
and
that
distinguishes
this
case
even
from
the
jorn
case,
where
the
mistrial
was
occasioned
by
the
conduct
of
the
trial
judge.
here
we
have
the
underlying
cause,
the
material
cause
if
you
will,
the
bad
indictment
was
created
by
the
prosecution.
this
--
well,
i
would
pass
again
to
the
third
point,
what
i
call
the
official
cause
of
the
mistrial
was
the
motion
for
the
mistrial
made
by
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
again,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
jorn
case,
where
in
dissenting,
three
justices
noted
that
the
--
i'm
quoting
"the
mistrial
was
not
requested
by
the
prosecution",
this
cannot
be
said
about
this
case.
the
citation
for
the
ewell
case
is
383
us
116,
1966
case.
returning
for
the
moment
to
this
idea
that
the
cause
here
and
also
the
motion
for
the
mistrial
occasion
--
was
occasioned
by
the
prosecution's
conduct.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
concept
of
overreaching
expressed
by
justice
harlan
in
the
jorn
case.
i
think
here
we
have
overreaching.
now
overreaching,
i
would
add,
does
not
have
to
go
so
far
as
to
be
bad
faith.
it
can
be
as
justice
frankfurter
indicated
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
brock
versus
north
carolina,
it
can
be
incompetent
or
a
casual
or
ineffective
conduct
of
a
prosecutor.
i
would
also
point
out
that
it
can
be
passive
as
well
as
active
here.
in
the
downum
case,
we
have
what
might
be
termed
passive
overreaching.
the
prosecutor
didn't
have
the
witnesses
there
to
testify
against
the
defendant.
here,
apparently,
it
resulted
from
the
drafting
of
a
bad
indictment
and
the
indictments
are
drafted
by
the
state's
attorney's
office,
but
more
importantly
here,
the
state
was
actually
given
a
second
chance
to
correct
this
error
before
a
jury
was
empaneled
and
sworn
and
that's
when
the
case
went
to
trial.
and
we
suggest
here
that
the
error
would
not
have
been
held
so
serious
if
the
prosecution
had
not
proceeded
to
trial
on
this
bad
indictment.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes
your
honor,
in
the
constitutional
sense,
i
do.
i
think
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
ball
case,
where
the
court
noted
the
difference
between
the
voidable
and
the
void
indictments.
i
think
there
was
jurisdiction
within
the
meaning
of
jeopardy
under
the
sixth
amendment,
although,
i
hasten
to
add
that
jurisdiction
is
sometimes
an
elusive
concept.
certainly
here,
there
was
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
in
the
cause.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
i
believe
so,
yes.
had
there
been
no
jurisdiction
there,
that
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
hold
that
the
acquittal
itself
was
invalid,
the
acquittal
could
not
have
suddenly
caused
jeopardy
to
exist
where
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
i
point
out
the
purposes
of
an
indictment
here.
there
are
two
--
at
least
two
purposes
of
the
indictment
are
to
enable
the
accused
to
prepare
a
defense
and
of
course,
to
plead
for
jeopardy.
here,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
accused
had
not
been
able
to
prepare
a
defense
and
was,
in
fact,
ready
to
go
to
trial
and
this
is
indicated
also
by
his
objection
to
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial,
which
i
would
point
out,
does
not
appear
to
be
a
token
objection.
we
don't
have
the
record
of
the
state
court
proceedings,
but
i
would
quarrel
with
the
state's
characterization
of
this
objection
as
a
token
objection.
also
supporting
the
argument
here,
of
course,
is
the
decision
in
benton
versus
maryland,
where
the
court
noted
that
the
defendant
there,
as
here,
had
not
been
--
at
the
first
trial
had
not
been
terminated,
the
defendant
could
well
have
served
out
his
time
under
this
invalid
indictment.
this,
i
think,
is
a
very
important
practical
point,
which
also
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
you
see
the
defendant
could
have
served
time
even
in
a
case
where
the
state
would
argue
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
a
decision
in
line
with
what
the
state
urges
here
would
not
take
into
account
the
practicalities
present
in
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes,
i
think
he
would
have
been,
he
could
have
been.
however,
if
it
had
later
come
to
his
attention,
then
i
think
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
courts
of
illinois,
he
could
have
had
his
conviction
vacated
by
collateral
attack.
now
the
state
argues
that
once
it
comes
to
his
attention,
this
somehow
deprives
the
judge
of
a
power
to
continue
the
trial
when
in
the
first
instance,
the
judge
didn't
have
any
power
to
continue
the
trial.
i
don't
think
this
argument
again
comports
with
the
reality.
the
mere
fact
of
knowledge
should
not
be
controlling
in
this
case.
here,
the
defendant
admittedly
with
knowledge
or
notice,
if
you
will,
after
this
defect
was
called
to
his
attention,
wanted
to
continue
with
the
trial.
now
i
ask
your
honors,
what
would
you
say
if
i
were
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
same
defendant
and
he
had
objected,
let's
say
he
had
raised
the
point
and
the
trial
have
been
terminated
on
the
defendant's
motion
and
then
a
valid
indictment
was
obtained
and
he
interposed
the
defense
of
double
jeopardy?
in
this
case,
we
are
here
today,
i
think
your
honors
would
hasten
to
point
out
to
me
that
this
mistrial
had
been
declared
under
the
defendant's
motion
and
that's
the
principle
of
the
ewell
case
and
the
tateo
case.
we
can't
take
inconsistent
positions
and
then
ask
for
relief.
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
stated
in
the
holden
case,
which
was
cited
in
the
state's
brief,
you
can't
blow
hot
and
cold.
now
that
was
a
double
jeopardy
case,
where
the
defendant
wanted
to
blow
hot
and
cold.
he
objected
to
an
invalid
indictment,
then
he
interposed
the
defense
of
double
jeopardy.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
consistent
throughout
the
proceedings.
he
objected
to
termination
of
the
trial.
he
maintained
in
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
that
the
indictment
was,
in
fact,
valid
and
i
think
obviously,
he
was
adequately
placed
upon
notice
and
he
could
prepare
a
defense
and
that's
one
of
the
essential
purposes
of
the
indictment.
another
point,
which
i
think
should
be
taken
into
consideration
here
and
i
will
make
it
only
briefly
is
the
potentiality
for
abuse.
we
do
not
argue
that
in
this
case,
there
was
an
abuse
by
the
prosecutor's
office
of
an
invalid
indictment,
but
the
potentiality
is
there,
especially
in
this
situation,
unlike
the
situation
in
united
states
versus
jorn,
for
example.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
quotation
from
people
versus
barrett
(ph)
in
the
downum
case,
which
i
think
quite
adequately
covers
that
particular
issue.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
well,
i
think
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
if
the
state
tries
an
individual
serially
enough
times,
i
think
eventually,
they
will
get
a
conviction
which
will
be
upheld.
even
this
advantage,
which
i
think
your
honors
characterize
this
slight,
but
which
i
don't
think
is
so
slight,
would
--
might
be
sufficient
for
a
prosecutor
to
take
advantage
of.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
in
the
experience
of
lawyers,
frequently
a
prosecutor
will
go
to
a
jury
with
a
case,
which
due
not
necessarily
to
a
bad
indictment,
but
due
to
very
strong
error,
he
may
suspect,
will
be
reversed.
now
in
that
situation,
he
does
not
terminate
the
trial.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
they
certainly
are
different
situations.
i
cannot
say
with
certainty
to
what
extent
this
abuse
might
be
taken
advantage
of
by
the
state's
attorney's
of
cook
county,
for
example.
if
at
all,
perhaps,
there
would
be
no
abuse
in
our
state's
attorney's
office
in
cook
county,
but
the
potentiality
is
there,
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
designed
to
guard
against.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
well,
if
it
were
to
come
to
the
defendant's
attention,
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
estopped
from
later
raising
it
if
he
chooses
in
to
go
ahead
with
the
trial.
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
the
case
--
mr.
ronald
p.
alwin
yes,
that
is
my
understanding.
i
think
the
final
point
i
would
make
here
is
that
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
go
to
this
jury.
in
answer
to
what
was
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
mr.
gildea,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
would
just
be
a
waste
of
time
for
the
state
to
continue
with
this
trial
if
the
same
would
be
reversed
on
appeal.
to
answer
there
would
be
a
waste
of
time
is
shortsighted
for
this
overlooks
the
valued
right
of
the
defendant
to
go
to
this
jury
and
by
this
confrontation
to
end
the
confrontation,
rather
with
the
state
at
this
time.
i
would
finally
point
out
that
if
your
honors
have
doubt
about
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
plea
of
double
jeopardy
should
be
sustained
as
your
honors
pointed
out
in
downum,
this
doubt
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
citizen.
in
the
final
analysis,
as
justice
harlan
stated
enjoined
with
the
judges'
decision
in
the
--
the
trial
judges'
decision
to
abort
the
trials
to
be
tempered
with
the
defendant's
right
to
go
to
this
jury,
which
has
been
selected
and
sworn
and
to
end
this
confrontation
with
the
state
right
at
that
point.
that
was
overlooked
here.
finally,
i
would
add
if
in
this
situation
it
is
a
criminal
who
must
go
free
because
as
justice
clark
stated
in
mapp
versus
ohio,
because
the
constable
is
wondered,
we
must
remember
here
that
again
as
he
stated,
it
is
the
law
that
sets
him
free.
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
