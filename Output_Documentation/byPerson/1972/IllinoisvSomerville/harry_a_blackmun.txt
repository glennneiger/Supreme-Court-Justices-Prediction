justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
are
you
seeking
the
ruling
here
that's
based
on
the
jurisdictional
nature
of
the
indictment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
trial
had
been
going
on
for
three
days
and
the
defect
was
discovered,
your
position
would
be
the
same?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it,
it's
not
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
wasn't
there
an
element
of
potentiality
of
abuse,
if
i
can
call
it
that
on
the
other
side
also,
your
case
might
be
scheduled
for
trial
on
wednesday
and
on
monday
you
will
see
the
defect
in
the
indictment.
you
can
move
today
to
strike
the
indictment
and
not
be
subject
to
double
jeopardy,
but
if
you
play
a
game
and
if
that
jury
is
called
and
sworn,
then
you
have
the
present
situation.
so
that
there
is
a
potentiality
of
a
game
playing
in
that
respect
too,
isn't
it?
