justice
william
o.
douglas
mr
gildea,
in
--
just
getting
back
to
the
distinction
you
are
doing
between
the
non
judge
and
the
non
indictment
cases.
now
this
court
in
the
green
case,
355
united
states,
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
i
am
quoting,
“is
a
guarantee
that
the
state
with
all
its
resources
and
power
shall
not
be
allowed
to
make
repeated
attempts
to
convict
an
individual
for
an
alleged
offense,
thereby
subjecting
him
to
embarrassment,
expense,
and
ordeal
and
compelling
him
to
live
in
a
continuing
state
of
anxiety
and
insecurity.
now
in
face
of
that
principle,
how
can
you
distinguish
the
non
indictment
and
non
judge
cases?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
thought
the
hypothetical
given
you
were
both,
cases
that
went
to
verdict
about
the
non
judge
and
the
non
indictment
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
here
you
have
the
same
offense,
not
a
different
one.
i
mean,
in
the
hypothetical
it's
the
same
offense.
in
a
non
indictment
case
we
are
dealing
with
precisely
the
same
offense,
aren't
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
in
the
non
judge
case
that
the
chief
suggested
to
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
thought
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
principle
and
that's
what
the
guarantee
means?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
isn't
that
what
in
both
the
non
judge
and
the
non
indictment
cases,
the
prosecution
was
involved
in
both
of
them.
the
prosecution
represented
the
state
and
it
repeated
the
second
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
identical
prosecution?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
because,
of
course,
the
convicted
defendant
has
himself
taken
the
appeal.
that's
been
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
been
the
theory,
that's
been
the
theory
upon
which
he
has
not
been
permitted
to
assert
double
jeopardy
if
he
is
successful
on
appeal.
now,
we're
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
case,
are
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
no
he
hasn't
on
is
what
the
court
is
held
that
where
he
is
the
appellant
and
the
successful
and
he
has
no
double
jeopardy
claim.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that's
not
what
we
--
not
what
we
held
in
downum
and
jorn
and
other
cases,
where
this
principle
has
been
involved?
justice
william
o.
douglas
very
well,
mr.
gildea.
mr.
alwin?
