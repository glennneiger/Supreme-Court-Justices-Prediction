mr.
e.
james
gildea
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
cause
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
reveal
a
--
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
reversing
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
dismissing
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
facts
in
issue
are
these.
the
petitioner
in
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court,
donald
somerville,
was
indicted
by
an
illinois
grand
jury
for
the
offense
of
felonious
theft.
a
jury
was
selected
and
sworn
to
try
the
issues
of
that
case.
the
day
afterwards,
before
any
evidence
was
heard
and
before
any
opening
arguments
were
made
by
counsel,
the
counsel
for
the
state
of
illinois
moved
the
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
basis
that
it
failed
to
charge
a
crime
cognizable
by
the
state
of
illinois.
that
is,
it
failed
to
avert
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense
of
felonious
theft,
and
that
is
the
intent
to
permanently
deprive.
over
a
general
objection
of
defense
counsel,
the
court
sustained
state's
motion
and
dismissed
the
indictment.
two
days
later,
the
matter
resubmitted
to
an
illinois
grand
jury,
and
a
second
indictment
was
returned,
charging
the
very
same
offense,
this
time
alleging
the
necessary
averments
to
constitute
an
offense
in
illinois
law.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes
your
honor,
under
illinois
law
no
offense
was
ever
charged,
the
defendant
have
never
was
placed
in
jeopardy,
and
the
state
was
free
to
resubmit
the
matter
to
any
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
don't
believe
he
is
in
any
more
jeopardy,
dependent
upon
whether
the
court
attaches
emphasis
to
the
cause
of
the
attachment,
but
in
terms
of
the
double
jeopardy
principles,
i
understand
that
he
is
no
more
in
jeopardy
after
the
selection
of
the
jury
than
he
has
before
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
he
was
in
no
jeopardy
and
under
the
traditional
and
the
classic
rule,
he
was
in
no
jeopardy
afterwards,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
classic
rule
for
attaching
a
jeopardy
is
only
when
a
defendant
is
placed
on
trial
before
a
jury
or
a
judge,
in
the
event
of
a
bench
trial,
on
a
regularly
charged
indictment.
however,
if
there
is
some
defect
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
before
which
the
matter
is
presented,
under
the
classical
rule
of
double
jeopardy,
he
is
not
then
in
legal
jeopardy
as
the
concept
was
understood
initially,
and
has
been
understood
to
my
way
of
thinking
since
the
inception
of
the
rule.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
that
is
one
aspect
of
the
case,
but
we
feel
that
we
can't
sustain
our
position
on
another
basis
besides
the
jurisdictional
basis,
and
that
is,
under
the
manifest
necessity,
a
doctrine
that
was
espoused
in
united
states
versus
perez
and
that
was
continuously
employed
by
this
court
up
until
as
recently,
as
united
states
versus
jorn.
our
basis
being
that,
in
reference
--
in
deference
to
illinois
state
criminal
procedure,
the
question
of
judicial
power
to
try
criminal
cases,
the
court,
before
whom
donald
somerville,
was
arraigned
for
trial,
had
been
it
theft
under
illinois
law,
no
power
to
trying
for
that
offense,
and
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
our
position
would
be
the
same,
insofar
as
the
manifest
necessity
doctrine,
that
is
that
the
court
which
still
have
to
have
declared
the
mistrial,
then
the
question
may
then
arise
as
to
whether
or
not
on
some
other
theory,
such
as
an
estoppel
theory,
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
re-prosecute
them.
and
that
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
sustained
any
substantial
burden
as
a
result
of
the
error,
if
it
is
an
error,
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
in
drafting
a
defective
indictment
and
proceeding
trial.
and
that
would
depend
again
upon
the
course
that
the
trial
took
up
to
the
time
of
the
mistrial.
then
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
status
of
the
evidence,
whether
or
not
the
evidence
at
that
point
reviewed
by
another
court
was
such
that
one
might
say
that
the
defendant
had
the
advantage
or
was
on
the
verge
of
an
acquittal
at
that
point.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
not
entirely
your
honor
because
illinois
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
you
could
not
but
we
--
the
acquittal,
i
think,
interjects
a
different
element
into
the
case,
and
that
goes
back
to
the
--
i
think,
the
inception
of
the
rule,
which
is
the
principle
of
autrefois
acquit
of
--
what
we
consider
here
is
the
fact
that
all
that
the
law
is
concerned
about,
or
concerned
with,
as
a
resolution
of
the
issues
of
the
case,
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
if
it
go
--
it
proceeds
to
a
verdict
and
there
is
an
acquittal,
then
it
is
hard
to
say
that
the
acquittal
that
was
returned
by
the
verdict
or
by
the
jury
had
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
any
defective
indictment.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
better.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
correct
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
this
--
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
insofar
as
they
transpire
up
to
the
point
where
the
mistrial
was
declared,
that
would
indicate
that
the
state
was
at
a
disadvantage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
evidence
whatsoever
had
been
introduced.
there
were
not
even
so
much
as
opening
arguments.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
there
is
no
question
that
the
error
is
attributable
to
the
prosecuting
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
where
an
irreversible
error
has
occurred,
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
and
it's
rooted
in
the
state's
negligence
unless
there
is
something
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
the
assertion,
unless
there
were
substantial
prejudice
to
the
defendant
or
unless
there
was
some
indication
in
the
record
that
the
assertion
of
the
defect
was
interjected
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
an
acquittal
then
under
those
circumstances,
we're
submitting
that
that
doesn't
cast
to
a
double
jeopardy
because
what
were
--
what
would
happen
in
that
case
if
the
trial
were
aborted,
it
would
proceed
to
a
termination
and
the
best
that
we
can
hope
for
is
--
well,
there
could
be
an
acquittal,
but
under
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
of
course,
on
the
retrial
there
was
a
conviction
and
there
is
no
indication
here
that
the
subsequent
trial
headed
was
in
any
way
different
from
the
initial
proceedings
or
that
the
state
gained
any
advantage
in
the
course
of
the
subsequent
trial.
so,
what
the
alternatives
are,
are
simply
to
proceed
to
a
termination,
in
which
case
that
all
that
the
state
can
hope
for
is
gaining
a
conviction,
in
which
case
the
defendant
could
assert
the
jurisdictional
defect
which
is
never
waived
and
would
have
in
his
corner
and
his
advantage
the
prospect
of
having
a
retrial,
it
just
could
not
be
avoided.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
that's
what
we
assert
as
the
traditional
view
and
we
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no
your
honor.
the
reason
i
refer
to
the
manifest
necessity
doctrine
is
because
this
court
has
--
it
has
been
intimated
in
benton
versus
maryland,
which
is
premised
upon
people
versus
barrett
(ph)
new
york
case
where
it
was
said
that
there
was
a
different
connotation
attached
to
the
term
of
attachment
of
jeopardy
where
it
was
said
that
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
defendant
what
differences
does
it
make,
whether
or
not
the
court
has
jurisdiction
and
any
judgment
to
be
sustained
because
as
a
practical
matter,
he
still
faces
the
jeopardy
of
the
prospect
of
being
sentenced
to
penitentiary
and
not
for
observing
the
error.
so
in
that
--
there
seems
to
be
some
suggesting
that
there
is
a
difference
between
practical
jeopardy
and
legal
jeopardy,
and
that's
why
i
made
that
distinction.
but
under
the
traditional
view,
there
was
no
legal
jeopardy
in
this
case
because
the
court,
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
try
the
issues.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
no
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
for
this
reason.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
say
that,
but
i
think
i
am
allowed
to
make
this
one
qualification
and
that
is,
what
is
the
purpose
of
jurisdiction?
and
i
say
this,
that
the
only
purpose
in
jurisdiction
is
to
restrict
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
court.
it's
for
--
it's
for
the
advantage
of
the
defendant,
so
to
speak,
so
that
the
court
cannot
try
any
criminal
case
except
those
that
are
allowed
by
the
particular
state
constitution.
now,
if
it
should
proceed
to
do
so,
even
though
its
ultra
vires
or
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
do
it,
the
one
--
the
ultimate
issue
in
any
legal
proceeding
is
to
determine
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
if
the
merits
of
the
case
are
determined
by
a
court
even
though
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
then
we're
put
in
this
position,
a
jury
or
a
trier
of
fact
has
resolved
the
issues
against
the
state.
now,
albeit,
the
court
perhaps
did
not
have
jurisdictionm
the
state
was
not
prejudiced
by
that
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
that
had
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
there
would
have
been
a
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
and
therefore,
since
the
matter
was
determined
on
the
merits,
then
why
allow
the
state
to
avert
that
result
simply
by
claiming
lack
of
jurisdiction.
so
i
think
that
that's
a
big
difference.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no,
i
don't,
because
he
could
not
waive
that.
my
basis
is
this,
the
court
could
not
proceed.
the
court
--
if
the
court
did
not
have
the
authority
granted
by
the
state
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
he
said,
let's
go
ahead
and
he
was
acquitted.
i
think,
at
that
instance,
and
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
been
acting
beyond
its
powers.
now
if
the
defendant
participated
in
that
and
said,
let's
go
ahead,
then
it's
a
different
situation.
then
perhaps,
in
that
instance
if
he
agreed
to
an
illegal
judicial
proceeding,
then
i
question
whether
or
not
he
could
claim
double
jeopardy.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes
sir,
it's
a
complete
malady
and
i
think
that
perhaps
this
really
points
out
the
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
again
it's
a
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
--
malady.
itâ€™s
always
been
in
view.
it's
never
different.
i
think
that
from
the
inception
of
the
rule,
if
we
refer
to
from
the
time
of
lord
cook
all
the
way
up
to
the
present,
it's
always
been
the
same.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
am
not
sure
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
distinction.
if
you
consider
in
this
respect
at
least
in
illinois,
it's
the
indictment
that
gives
the
court,
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
that
gives
the
court
the
judicial
power
to
try
a
case.
now
if
there
is
no
valid
indictment,
that
court
whether
it
wears
black
robes
and
whether
the
court
be
the
judge
has
been
sworn
and
is
drawing
a
salary
under
state
law,
it
makes
no
difference
because
he
has
no
more
authority
than
i
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
a
defendant
in
the
other
situation.
in
either
case,
the
court
does
not
have
the
authority
to
try
that
issue.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes,
but
not
on
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
have
to
concede
that
i
do
believe
there
is
a
difference
because
there
is
--
in
that
instance,
the
parties
place
the
repliance
on
--
reliance
on
the
apparent
authority
of
the
court.
the
others,
the
hypothetical
posed
by
the
chief
judge
was,
of
course,
an
extreme
one
which
i
--
is
difficult
to
--
event
having
occurred,
but
where
all
the
parties,
at
least
assumes
the
authority
of
the
court
and
it
does
proceed
to
a
--
before
a
judge
that
has
the
authority
to
try
the
issues
but
whose
authority
was
not
activated
and
by
a
proper
indictment,
and
this
again
is
solely
a
restriction
on
the
exercise
of
judicial
power.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
there
is
a
distinction
between
two
cases.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
thatâ€™s
correct.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
put
it
against
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
in
the
one
case
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
if
the
court
has
the
appearance
of
judicial
authority
and
if
there
is
a
defect
in
the
mechanism
by
which
that
court
exercises
its
judicial
authority,
then
in
that
instance,
if
the
case
proceeds
to
a
verdict
and
there
is
an
acquittal,
then
the
question
remains,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
rule.
and
in
this
situation,
in
that
situation
we're
speaking
about,
again,
if
the
merits
have
been
regularly
tried
before
a
court
that
has
apparent
jurisdiction
to
try
the
case,
and
it's
resolved
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
then
the
question
becomes,
well,
what
is
the
infirmity
in
that
verdict
and
the
subsequent
judgment
and
the
infirmity
is
a
technical
one,
is
it
not?
the
infirmity
being
that
the,
there
was
not
a
regular
procedure
in
which
that
judge
was
authorized
to
try
the
case.
now
bearing
in
mind
that
when
we
speak
about
the
principle
of
double
jeopardy,
we
are
talking
about
competing
interest.
we
are
talking
about
the
interest
of
society
in
punishing
the
guilty,
assuming
that
that's
a
legitimate
interest
and
we
are
talking
about
the
interest
of
the
defendant
in
being
tried
in
a
single
prosecution.
now,
when
we
contrast
those
two
interests
in
the
situation
that
we
are
talking
about,
can
we
say
and
i
think
this
is
how
i
would
resolve
the
question,
can
we
say
that
the
state
or
the
prosecution
or
society
by
virtue
of
that
defect
in
the
procedure
whereby
the
judgment
was
rendered,
suffered
such
prejudice
that
the
verdict
should
be
overturned
and
i
would
say
in
that
instance
no,
it
hasn't
suffered
any
prejudice.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
illinois
law.
illinois
does
have
an
amendment
statute
but
only
after
formal
defects,
but
this
went
to
the
--
and
for
that
reason
it
wasn't
subject
to
being
amended
and
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
there
again
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
think
so
your
honor
and
perhaps
this
is
bringing
up
the
point
that
i
should
have
made
before.
in
this
case
what
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
technical
flaws
which
will
occur,
much
the
same
as
they
occurred
in
the
case
of
lovato
versus
new
mexico
where
the
defendant
pleaded
and
barred
and
that
was
overruled
and
there
was
a
failure
to
arraign
the
defendant
and
they
proceeded
to
trial
and
they
recognized
that,
they
rearraigned
him
which
was
a
technical
mistrial
and
they
proceeded
with
the
trial.
that's
one
instance.
now
again
i
say,
how
was
the
states
are
prejudice
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
judgment,
verdict
and
judgment?
but,
if
you're
talking
about,
let
us
say
a
judge
who
has
absolutely
no
authority
to
preside
than
the
state
in
that
instance
is
prejudiced,
society
is
prejudiced
because
it
cannot
tolerate
persons
without
judicial
authority
presiding
in
criminal
cases.
in
that
case
i
would
say
that
the
state
or
society
is
prejudiced
and
there
should
be
a
distinction
between
the
two
cases.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
very
definitely,
and
an
illustration
of
that
is
the
case
that
we
have
put
in
our
brief,
people
ex
rel.
ledford
versus
brantley
was
a
case
for
pointing
to
charge
the
defendant
with
burglary
and
under
illinois
law
to
pass
to
the
offense
of
burglary
you
have
to
show
ownership
of
the
property
burgled
in
someone
other
than
the
defendant.
in
that
case
they
fail
to
allege
the
ownership
of
burglarized
premises
and
the
inmate
in
that
case,
ledford,
after
pleading
guilty
to
the
indictment,
he
pleaded
guilty
which
normally
waives
all
defects
other
than
jurisdictional
defects,
pleaded
guilty
and
subsequently
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
under
the
state
habeas
corpus
act
and
the
court
held
in
that
case,
that
his
plea
of
guilty
did
not
wave
the
jurisdictional
defect
and
therefore
it
was
subject
to
an
attack
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
i
think
first
of
all,
green,
if
i
am
not
mistaken
involved
the
case
that
went
to
verdict
and
the
defendant
was
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
was
coming
to
this
your
honor.
the
defendant
in
that
case
which
was
regularly
tried
had
been
acquitted
of
the
greater
offense
and
convicted
of
the
lesser
offense
and
appealed
and
on
a
reversal
and
remand
that
the
state
again
charged
him
with
the
greater
offense
and
he
was
convicted
of
the
greater
offense
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
they
had
constituted
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes
your
honor
but
i
think
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
but
the
question
is,
what
is
understood
by
the
language
of
the
court
and
i
take
that
the
language
is
to
be
construed
in
reference
to
not
only
the
green
case,
but
all
other
double
jeopardy
cases
from
at
least
in
this
country
from
united
states
versus
perez
up
to
the
present
time
and
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
what
i
understand
by
that
is,
what
the
principle
is
aimed
at,
is
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
has
within
its
power
and
resource,
within
its
resources
the
power
to
repetitiously
or
successively
re-prosecute
a
defendant
on
a
criminal
charge.
and
as
i
understand
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
true.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
but
doesn't
the
same
thing
happen
when
a
case
is
--
proceeds
to
a
hung
jury
and
the
jury
is
discharged,
doesn't
the
same
thing
happen
when
the
case
proceeds
to
a
conviction
and
because
of
error
interjected
in
the
record
by
the
prosecution,
the
case
is
reversed
and
remanded.
now
in
that
instance,
we
allow
re-prosecution.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
he's
taken
the
appeal.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
isn't
that
putting
him
in
the
horns
of
dilemma
though
in
order
to
exercise
his
right
to
challenge
the
propriety
of
his
conviction,
he
has
to
forgo
his
double
jeopardy,
right?
i
think
it's
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
he
hasn't
but
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
but
i
think
the
principle,
what
the
principle
is
aimed
at
is
the
fact
--
is
the
abuse
of
the
prosecutor's
authority
and
what
i
have
envision
to
be
the
abuse
of
the
prosecutor's
authority
is
the
ability
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
to
attempt
to
avoid
an
acquittal
by
successive
prosecutions.
but
in
this
case
here,
that
was
not
the
case
because
the
state
did
not
attempt
to
avoid
an
acquittal
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
the
state
was
in
jeopardy
of
facing
an
acquittal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
consider
the
proposition
that
on
the
subsequent
trial,
the
state
was
successful
and
that
the
defendant
was
convicted
and
we
consider
that
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
impediment
in
the
indictment
that
was
objectionably
determinable,
objectively
determinable,
and
that
there
were
no
other
indications
in
the
record
that
the
state
was
at
a
disadvantage
and
could
not
convict
the
defendant
on
the
merits.
i
would
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
underlying
policy
of
the
rule
was
not
violated
in
this
instance.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
cause
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
reveal
a
--
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
reversing
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
dismissing
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
facts
in
issue
are
these.
the
petitioner
in
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court,
donald
somerville,
was
indicted
by
an
illinois
grand
jury
for
the
offense
of
felonious
theft.
a
jury
was
selected
and
sworn
to
try
the
issues
of
that
case.
the
day
afterwards,
before
any
evidence
was
heard
and
before
any
opening
arguments
were
made
by
counsel,
the
counsel
for
the
state
of
illinois
moved
the
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
basis
that
it
failed
to
charge
a
crime
cognizable
by
the
state
of
illinois.
that
is,
it
failed
to
avert
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense
of
felonious
theft,
and
that
is
the
intent
to
permanently
deprive.
over
a
general
objection
of
defense
counsel,
the
court
sustained
state's
motion
and
dismissed
the
indictment.
two
days
later,
the
matter
resubmitted
to
an
illinois
grand
jury,
and
a
second
indictment
was
returned,
charging
the
very
same
offense,
this
time
alleging
the
necessary
averments
to
constitute
an
offense
in
illinois
law.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes
your
honor,
under
illinois
law
no
offense
was
ever
charged,
the
defendant
have
never
was
placed
in
jeopardy,
and
the
state
was
free
to
resubmit
the
matter
to
any
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
don't
believe
he
is
in
any
more
jeopardy,
dependent
upon
whether
the
court
attaches
emphasis
to
the
cause
of
the
attachment,
but
in
terms
of
the
double
jeopardy
principles,
i
understand
that
he
is
no
more
in
jeopardy
after
the
selection
of
the
jury
than
he
has
before
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
he
was
in
no
jeopardy
and
under
the
traditional
and
the
classic
rule,
he
was
in
no
jeopardy
afterwards,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
classic
rule
for
attaching
a
jeopardy
is
only
when
a
defendant
is
placed
on
trial
before
a
jury
or
a
judge,
in
the
event
of
a
bench
trial,
on
a
regularly
charged
indictment.
however,
if
there
is
some
defect
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
before
which
the
matter
is
presented,
under
the
classical
rule
of
double
jeopardy,
he
is
not
then
in
legal
jeopardy
as
the
concept
was
understood
initially,
and
has
been
understood
to
my
way
of
thinking
since
the
inception
of
the
rule.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
that
is
one
aspect
of
the
case,
but
we
feel
that
we
can't
sustain
our
position
on
another
basis
besides
the
jurisdictional
basis,
and
that
is,
under
the
manifest
necessity,
a
doctrine
that
was
espoused
in
united
states
versus
perez
and
that
was
continuously
employed
by
this
court
up
until
as
recently,
as
united
states
versus
jorn.
our
basis
being
that,
in
reference
--
in
deference
to
illinois
state
criminal
procedure,
the
question
of
judicial
power
to
try
criminal
cases,
the
court,
before
whom
donald
somerville,
was
arraigned
for
trial,
had
been
it
theft
under
illinois
law,
no
power
to
trying
for
that
offense,
and
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
our
position
would
be
the
same,
insofar
as
the
manifest
necessity
doctrine,
that
is
that
the
court
which
still
have
to
have
declared
the
mistrial,
then
the
question
may
then
arise
as
to
whether
or
not
on
some
other
theory,
such
as
an
estoppel
theory,
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
re-prosecute
them.
and
that
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
sustained
any
substantial
burden
as
a
result
of
the
error,
if
it
is
an
error,
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
in
drafting
a
defective
indictment
and
proceeding
trial.
and
that
would
depend
again
upon
the
course
that
the
trial
took
up
to
the
time
of
the
mistrial.
then
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
status
of
the
evidence,
whether
or
not
the
evidence
at
that
point
reviewed
by
another
court
was
such
that
one
might
say
that
the
defendant
had
the
advantage
or
was
on
the
verge
of
an
acquittal
at
that
point.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
not
entirely
your
honor
because
illinois
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
you
could
not
but
we
--
the
acquittal,
i
think,
interjects
a
different
element
into
the
case,
and
that
goes
back
to
the
--
i
think,
the
inception
of
the
rule,
which
is
the
principle
of
autrefois
acquit
of
--
what
we
consider
here
is
the
fact
that
all
that
the
law
is
concerned
about,
or
concerned
with,
as
a
resolution
of
the
issues
of
the
case,
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
if
it
go
--
it
proceeds
to
a
verdict
and
there
is
an
acquittal,
then
it
is
hard
to
say
that
the
acquittal
that
was
returned
by
the
verdict
or
by
the
jury
had
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
any
defective
indictment.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
better.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
correct
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
this
--
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
insofar
as
they
transpire
up
to
the
point
where
the
mistrial
was
declared,
that
would
indicate
that
the
state
was
at
a
disadvantage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
evidence
whatsoever
had
been
introduced.
there
were
not
even
so
much
as
opening
arguments.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
there
is
no
question
that
the
error
is
attributable
to
the
prosecuting
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
where
an
irreversible
error
has
occurred,
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
and
it's
rooted
in
the
state's
negligence
unless
there
is
something
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
the
assertion,
unless
there
were
substantial
prejudice
to
the
defendant
or
unless
there
was
some
indication
in
the
record
that
the
assertion
of
the
defect
was
interjected
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
an
acquittal
then
under
those
circumstances,
we're
submitting
that
that
doesn't
cast
to
a
double
jeopardy
because
what
were
--
what
would
happen
in
that
case
if
the
trial
were
aborted,
it
would
proceed
to
a
termination
and
the
best
that
we
can
hope
for
is
--
well,
there
could
be
an
acquittal,
but
under
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
of
course,
on
the
retrial
there
was
a
conviction
and
there
is
no
indication
here
that
the
subsequent
trial
headed
was
in
any
way
different
from
the
initial
proceedings
or
that
the
state
gained
any
advantage
in
the
course
of
the
subsequent
trial.
so,
what
the
alternatives
are,
are
simply
to
proceed
to
a
termination,
in
which
case
that
all
that
the
state
can
hope
for
is
gaining
a
conviction,
in
which
case
the
defendant
could
assert
the
jurisdictional
defect
which
is
never
waived
and
would
have
in
his
corner
and
his
advantage
the
prospect
of
having
a
retrial,
it
just
could
not
be
avoided.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
that's
what
we
assert
as
the
traditional
view
and
we
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no
your
honor.
the
reason
i
refer
to
the
manifest
necessity
doctrine
is
because
this
court
has
--
it
has
been
intimated
in
benton
versus
maryland,
which
is
premised
upon
people
versus
barrett
(ph)
new
york
case
where
it
was
said
that
there
was
a
different
connotation
attached
to
the
term
of
attachment
of
jeopardy
where
it
was
said
that
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
defendant
what
differences
does
it
make,
whether
or
not
the
court
has
jurisdiction
and
any
judgment
to
be
sustained
because
as
a
practical
matter,
he
still
faces
the
jeopardy
of
the
prospect
of
being
sentenced
to
penitentiary
and
not
for
observing
the
error.
so
in
that
--
there
seems
to
be
some
suggesting
that
there
is
a
difference
between
practical
jeopardy
and
legal
jeopardy,
and
that's
why
i
made
that
distinction.
but
under
the
traditional
view,
there
was
no
legal
jeopardy
in
this
case
because
the
court,
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
try
the
issues.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
no
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
for
this
reason.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
say
that,
but
i
think
i
am
allowed
to
make
this
one
qualification
and
that
is,
what
is
the
purpose
of
jurisdiction?
and
i
say
this,
that
the
only
purpose
in
jurisdiction
is
to
restrict
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
court.
it's
for
--
it's
for
the
advantage
of
the
defendant,
so
to
speak,
so
that
the
court
cannot
try
any
criminal
case
except
those
that
are
allowed
by
the
particular
state
constitution.
now,
if
it
should
proceed
to
do
so,
even
though
its
ultra
vires
or
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
do
it,
the
one
--
the
ultimate
issue
in
any
legal
proceeding
is
to
determine
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
if
the
merits
of
the
case
are
determined
by
a
court
even
though
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
then
we're
put
in
this
position,
a
jury
or
a
trier
of
fact
has
resolved
the
issues
against
the
state.
now,
albeit,
the
court
perhaps
did
not
have
jurisdictionm
the
state
was
not
prejudiced
by
that
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
that
had
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
there
would
have
been
a
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
and
therefore,
since
the
matter
was
determined
on
the
merits,
then
why
allow
the
state
to
avert
that
result
simply
by
claiming
lack
of
jurisdiction.
so
i
think
that
that's
a
big
difference.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no,
i
don't,
because
he
could
not
waive
that.
my
basis
is
this,
the
court
could
not
proceed.
the
court
--
if
the
court
did
not
have
the
authority
granted
by
the
state
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
he
said,
let's
go
ahead
and
he
was
acquitted.
i
think,
at
that
instance,
and
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
been
acting
beyond
its
powers.
now
if
the
defendant
participated
in
that
and
said,
let's
go
ahead,
then
it's
a
different
situation.
then
perhaps,
in
that
instance
if
he
agreed
to
an
illegal
judicial
proceeding,
then
i
question
whether
or
not
he
could
claim
double
jeopardy.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes
sir,
it's
a
complete
malady
and
i
think
that
perhaps
this
really
points
out
the
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
again
it's
a
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
--
malady.
itâ€™s
always
been
in
view.
it's
never
different.
i
think
that
from
the
inception
of
the
rule,
if
we
refer
to
from
the
time
of
lord
cook
all
the
way
up
to
the
present,
it's
always
been
the
same.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
am
not
sure
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
distinction.
if
you
consider
in
this
respect
at
least
in
illinois,
it's
the
indictment
that
gives
the
court,
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
that
gives
the
court
the
judicial
power
to
try
a
case.
now
if
there
is
no
valid
indictment,
that
court
whether
it
wears
black
robes
and
whether
the
court
be
the
judge
has
been
sworn
and
is
drawing
a
salary
under
state
law,
it
makes
no
difference
because
he
has
no
more
authority
than
i
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
a
defendant
in
the
other
situation.
in
either
case,
the
court
does
not
have
the
authority
to
try
that
issue.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes,
but
not
on
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
have
to
concede
that
i
do
believe
there
is
a
difference
because
there
is
--
in
that
instance,
the
parties
place
the
repliance
on
--
reliance
on
the
apparent
authority
of
the
court.
the
others,
the
hypothetical
posed
by
the
chief
judge
was,
of
course,
an
extreme
one
which
i
--
is
difficult
to
--
event
having
occurred,
but
where
all
the
parties,
at
least
assumes
the
authority
of
the
court
and
it
does
proceed
to
a
--
before
a
judge
that
has
the
authority
to
try
the
issues
but
whose
authority
was
not
activated
and
by
a
proper
indictment,
and
this
again
is
solely
a
restriction
on
the
exercise
of
judicial
power.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
there
is
a
distinction
between
two
cases.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
thatâ€™s
correct.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
put
it
against
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
in
the
one
case
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
if
the
court
has
the
appearance
of
judicial
authority
and
if
there
is
a
defect
in
the
mechanism
by
which
that
court
exercises
its
judicial
authority,
then
in
that
instance,
if
the
case
proceeds
to
a
verdict
and
there
is
an
acquittal,
then
the
question
remains,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
rule.
and
in
this
situation,
in
that
situation
we're
speaking
about,
again,
if
the
merits
have
been
regularly
tried
before
a
court
that
has
apparent
jurisdiction
to
try
the
case,
and
it's
resolved
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
then
the
question
becomes,
well,
what
is
the
infirmity
in
that
verdict
and
the
subsequent
judgment
and
the
infirmity
is
a
technical
one,
is
it
not?
the
infirmity
being
that
the,
there
was
not
a
regular
procedure
in
which
that
judge
was
authorized
to
try
the
case.
now
bearing
in
mind
that
when
we
speak
about
the
principle
of
double
jeopardy,
we
are
talking
about
competing
interest.
we
are
talking
about
the
interest
of
society
in
punishing
the
guilty,
assuming
that
that's
a
legitimate
interest
and
we
are
talking
about
the
interest
of
the
defendant
in
being
tried
in
a
single
prosecution.
now,
when
we
contrast
those
two
interests
in
the
situation
that
we
are
talking
about,
can
we
say
and
i
think
this
is
how
i
would
resolve
the
question,
can
we
say
that
the
state
or
the
prosecution
or
society
by
virtue
of
that
defect
in
the
procedure
whereby
the
judgment
was
rendered,
suffered
such
prejudice
that
the
verdict
should
be
overturned
and
i
would
say
in
that
instance
no,
it
hasn't
suffered
any
prejudice.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
illinois
law.
illinois
does
have
an
amendment
statute
but
only
after
formal
defects,
but
this
went
to
the
--
and
for
that
reason
it
wasn't
subject
to
being
amended
and
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
there
again
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
think
so
your
honor
and
perhaps
this
is
bringing
up
the
point
that
i
should
have
made
before.
in
this
case
what
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
technical
flaws
which
will
occur,
much
the
same
as
they
occurred
in
the
case
of
lovato
versus
new
mexico
where
the
defendant
pleaded
and
barred
and
that
was
overruled
and
there
was
a
failure
to
arraign
the
defendant
and
they
proceeded
to
trial
and
they
recognized
that,
they
rearraigned
him
which
was
a
technical
mistrial
and
they
proceeded
with
the
trial.
that's
one
instance.
now
again
i
say,
how
was
the
states
are
prejudice
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
judgment,
verdict
and
judgment?
but,
if
you're
talking
about,
let
us
say
a
judge
who
has
absolutely
no
authority
to
preside
than
the
state
in
that
instance
is
prejudiced,
society
is
prejudiced
because
it
cannot
tolerate
persons
without
judicial
authority
presiding
in
criminal
cases.
in
that
case
i
would
say
that
the
state
or
society
is
prejudiced
and
there
should
be
a
distinction
between
the
two
cases.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
very
definitely,
and
an
illustration
of
that
is
the
case
that
we
have
put
in
our
brief,
people
ex
rel.
ledford
versus
brantley
was
a
case
for
pointing
to
charge
the
defendant
with
burglary
and
under
illinois
law
to
pass
to
the
offense
of
burglary
you
have
to
show
ownership
of
the
property
burgled
in
someone
other
than
the
defendant.
in
that
case
they
fail
to
allege
the
ownership
of
burglarized
premises
and
the
inmate
in
that
case,
ledford,
after
pleading
guilty
to
the
indictment,
he
pleaded
guilty
which
normally
waives
all
defects
other
than
jurisdictional
defects,
pleaded
guilty
and
subsequently
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
under
the
state
habeas
corpus
act
and
the
court
held
in
that
case,
that
his
plea
of
guilty
did
not
wave
the
jurisdictional
defect
and
therefore
it
was
subject
to
an
attack
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
i
think
first
of
all,
green,
if
i
am
not
mistaken
involved
the
case
that
went
to
verdict
and
the
defendant
was
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
i
was
coming
to
this
your
honor.
the
defendant
in
that
case
which
was
regularly
tried
had
been
acquitted
of
the
greater
offense
and
convicted
of
the
lesser
offense
and
appealed
and
on
a
reversal
and
remand
that
the
state
again
charged
him
with
the
greater
offense
and
he
was
convicted
of
the
greater
offense
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
they
had
constituted
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
yes
your
honor
but
i
think
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
but
the
question
is,
what
is
understood
by
the
language
of
the
court
and
i
take
that
the
language
is
to
be
construed
in
reference
to
not
only
the
green
case,
but
all
other
double
jeopardy
cases
from
at
least
in
this
country
from
united
states
versus
perez
up
to
the
present
time
and
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
well,
what
i
understand
by
that
is,
what
the
principle
is
aimed
at,
is
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
has
within
its
power
and
resource,
within
its
resources
the
power
to
repetitiously
or
successively
re-prosecute
a
defendant
on
a
criminal
charge.
and
as
i
understand
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
that's
true.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
but
doesn't
the
same
thing
happen
when
a
case
is
--
proceeds
to
a
hung
jury
and
the
jury
is
discharged,
doesn't
the
same
thing
happen
when
the
case
proceeds
to
a
conviction
and
because
of
error
interjected
in
the
record
by
the
prosecution,
the
case
is
reversed
and
remanded.
now
in
that
instance,
we
allow
re-prosecution.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
he's
taken
the
appeal.
mr.
e.
james
gildea
isn't
that
putting
him
in
the
horns
of
dilemma
though
in
order
to
exercise
his
right
to
challenge
the
propriety
of
his
conviction,
he
has
to
forgo
his
double
jeopardy,
right?
i
think
it's
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
he
hasn't
but
--
mr.
e.
james
gildea
but
i
think
the
principle,
what
the
principle
is
aimed
at
is
the
fact
--
is
the
abuse
of
the
prosecutor's
authority
and
what
i
have
envision
to
be
the
abuse
of
the
prosecutor's
authority
is
the
ability
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
to
attempt
to
avoid
an
acquittal
by
successive
prosecutions.
but
in
this
case
here,
that
was
not
the
case
because
the
state
did
not
attempt
to
avoid
an
acquittal
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
the
state
was
in
jeopardy
of
facing
an
acquittal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
consider
the
proposition
that
on
the
subsequent
trial,
the
state
was
successful
and
that
the
defendant
was
convicted
and
we
consider
that
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
impediment
in
the
indictment
that
was
objectionably
determinable,
objectively
determinable,
and
that
there
were
no
other
indications
in
the
record
that
the
state
was
at
a
disadvantage
and
could
not
convict
the
defendant
on
the
merits.
i
would
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
underlying
policy
of
the
rule
was
not
violated
in
this
instance.
thank
you,
your
honors.
