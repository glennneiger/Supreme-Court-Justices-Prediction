mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.

let
me
back
up
now
to
the
day
of
the
trial.
suppose
the
day
before
the
trial,
a
motion
had
been
made
by
defense
counsel,
challenging
the
indictment
on
the
same
grounds,
and
if
the
court
had
dismissed
the
indictment
as
defective,
what
would
have
been
the
status
under
illinois
law
of
that
case,
could
they
have
gone
to
the
grand
jury
again,
got
a
new
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
he
more
in
jeopardy
after
the
jury
is
picked
under
that
kind
of
an
indictment,
the
defective
indictment,
than
he
was
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
was
in
no
jeopardy
before
under
the
defective
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it's
a
jurisdictional
defect,
how
can
jeopardy
attach?
that
is,
if
there
is
an
indictment
which
cannot
bring
him
to
trial,
then
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
formality
of
the
jury
having
been
selected
and
sworn
and
has
been
carried
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
traditional
view
doesn't
relate
to
defective
indictments.
is
there
any
case
of
this
court
which
has
ever
said
that
jeopardy
attaches
on
a
non-indictment,
an
indictment
that
is
no
indictment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
suggest
hypothetical,
it
may
seem
a
little
extreme
to
you.
suppose
in
one
of
that
very
large
courts
in
the
country
where
they've
got
as
they
do
in
several
places,
a
150
year,
a
160
trail
judges
and
nobody
knows
all
of
them
that
side,
that
some
person
walked
into
the
courtroom
under
a
valid
indictment,
and
he
is
not
a
judge
at
all,
he
is
just
a
fellow
with
the
black
robe
and
he
sits
and
presides
over
the
trial
and
conviction
results,
is
that
a
valid
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
complete
malady,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
take
it
one
step
further,
an
acquittal
results?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
malady.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
take
the
next
step,
could
he
be
tried
again
by
a
real
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
here
we
have
a
non-indictment
instead
of
a
non-judge,
haven't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
distinction
is
difficult
for
me
to
grasp,
but
perhaps
you
can
enlighten
me?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gildea,
suppose
instead
of
a
non
judge,
a
spurious
judge,
you
had
a
situation
where
the
judge
was
a
genuine
judge
and
you
had
a
valid
indictment,
but
someone
just
forgot
to
administer
the
oath
of
office
to
the
jurors
and
he
went
on
with
the
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
valid
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
at
that
time
under
this
indictment,
do
you
think
there
was
jeopardy
and
when
that
jury
was
sworn
and
took
its
place
in
the
box?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
saying
that
if
everyone
in
the
proceeding
had
been
careless
and
not
noted
this
defect,
then
he
might
have
been
in
prison
for
several
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
illinois
law,
could
--
this
trial
had
been
suspended
and
the
grand
jury
return
a
new
indictment?
i
notice
that
it
was
done
very
swiftly
here,
two
days
or
something,
could
there,
have
this
jury
stand
aside,
keep
it
impaneled
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
say,
they
are
impaneled
on
one
indictment
and
they
have
to
be
tried
on
that
or
nothing?
