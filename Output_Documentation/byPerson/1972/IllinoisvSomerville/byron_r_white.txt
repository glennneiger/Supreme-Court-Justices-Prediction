if
illinois,
hereafter,
simply
lets
the
trial
go
forward
and
finish,
and
leaves
it
up
to
the
defendant
to
raise
the
jurisdictional
question,
then
what
you
have
lost
is
simply
the
waste
of
time,
just
waste
of
some
time
and
effort?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
really
if
he
was
convicted
in
that
trail
and
then
he
appealed,
and
the
case
was
reversed
there
could
be
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
was
acquitted,
you
could
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
right,
exactly
right,
so
you
couldn't
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
really
arguing
here
whether
or
not
the
state
should
--
whether
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
terminate
the
trial
and
not
waste
its
time
when
a
sufficiently,
serious
defect
of
the
proceedings
arises
which
would
almost
guarantee
reversal?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
box
the
state
found
itself
in,
it
created
it
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
here
--
are
you
--
is
your
general
proposition
that
where
there
is
a
defect
in
the
trial
that
would
guarantee
reversal
or
almost
guarantee
reversal,
arises
out
of
the
state's
negligence,
a
mistrial
can
always
be
declared?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
the
state's
negligence
--
and
it's
rooted
in
the
state's
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
logical
conclusion
of
that
is
that
even
if
he
were
tried
and
acquitted,
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
said
there
was
that
because
--
you
said
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
basis
then
if
the
judge
said
to
the
defendant
by
the
way
the
indictment
is
defective,
do
you
want
a
mistrial?
he
said,
no,
and
judge
said,
alright,
we'll
go
ahead,
and
he
is
convicted,
you
would
say
that
would
stand
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
said
that,
you
know
let's
go
ahead
and
he
was
acquitted?

byron
