justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
she
is
the
only
named
plaintiff
within
this
subclass?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
her
case
is
now
have
been
terminated
because
she
is
receiving
benefit?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
see,
so
she
is
really
out
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
our
cases,
under
controlling
cases,
what
is
the
situation
then?
do
we
still
have
a
live
case
here?
when
the
only
--
when
there
is
no
named
plaintiff
still
with
case
of
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
pauper.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
satisfied
i
suppose,
wouldn't
you,
if
the
--
or
would
you,
if
the
decision
of
the
district
court
were
vacated?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
the
judgment
is
vacated?
justice
byron
r.
white
accept
the
your
court
hasn't
decided
one
way
or
another,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
sense
to
judgment
of
the
district
court
has
indiana
been
following
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
this
practically
guarantees
that
there
are
no
other
members
of
this
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
is
that
there
is
probably
no
other
member
of
this
class
who
could
now
intervene
in
the
lawsuit
because
you
have
made
sure
there
isn't
any
other
member
of
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
this
when
there
has
been
a
initial
determination
of
eligibility
and
then
as
you
say
each
week
there
is
a
necessity
of
the
redetermination
of
eligibility,
that
redetermination
is
normally
made
most
often
made
just
on
the
papers,
just
on
the
certification
that
is
received?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
each
week
he
doesn't
have
to
come
in
the
each
week,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
cannot
get
it
by
mail?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
comes
in
each
reach
and
he
fells
out
a
blank
for
that
week?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
man
on
your
initiative
there
is
an
interview?
justice
byron
r.
white
periodically?
now
is
a
determination
of
ineligibility
after
an
initial
determination
of
eligibility,
is
a
determination
of
ineligibility
for
some
future
week
ever
made
without
an
interview,
just
on
the
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
in
this
case,
was
there
an
interview?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
but
is
it
ever
done
just
on
certification
i
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
ever
happen
that
he
would
refuse
to
sign
the
voucher?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
happens
do
they
take
action
on
it
without
have
asking
what's
wrong,without
asking
him
for
an
interview
--
at
an
interview?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
that
one
of
your
propositions
is
that
the
indiana
method
of
determining
initial
eligibility
for
compensation
does
not
comply
with
goldberg
against
kelly.
justice
byron
r.
white
hold
on,
i
will
ask
you
if
this.
do
you
think
that
the
method
for
determining
eligibility
or
the
ineligibility
initially
in
indiana
comports
with
goldberg
against
kelly?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think
that
the
procedure
outlined
in
java
for
determining
initial
eligibility
for
unemployment
compensation
would
pass
muster
under
goldberg
against
kelly?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
fortiori
it
wouldn't
for
a
redetermination?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
court
disagreed
with
you,
that
the
procedure
outlined
in
java
for
determining
initial
eligibility
would
pass
muster
under
goldberg
against
kelly?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
let's
assume
the
court,
that
is
what
the
court
would
hold,
then
would
settle
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
must
be
determined
every
week?
i
take
it
you
just
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
each
week
is
a
new
determination
of
eligibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
to
the
extent
that
that
is
a
defensible
position,
then
you
are
going
to
get
into
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
goldberg
argument
only
becomes
really
a
cutting
if
you
are
right
in
saying
and
in
maintaining
that
this
weekly
determination
is
not
a
determination
of
initial
eligibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
she
is
the
only

plaintiff
within

justice
byron

her
