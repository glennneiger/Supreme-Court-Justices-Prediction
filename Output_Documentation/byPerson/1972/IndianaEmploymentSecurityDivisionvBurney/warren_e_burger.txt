before
you

mr.

it
would
help
me
if
you
clear
up
the
situation,
the
factual
situation.
as
i
understand
it
the
appeal
board
reversed
the
division
officer's
decision
to
terminate
these
benefits
and
so
what
is
the
posture
of
the
benefits
now?
were
they
allowed,
and
are
they
being
paid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
somewhere
in
this
massive
material,
i
got
the
impression
that
the
division
officer
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
have
reversed
--
had
been
reversed
by
the
appeal
board
and
that
the
benefits
denied
by
the
division
officer
were
then
granted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
the
same?
isn't
it
that
you
would
like
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
court
to
govern
future
faces
or
strike
advisory
would
like
an
opinion
from
the
court
governing
future
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
district
court
injunction
were
vacated,
you
would
soon
have
a
lot
of
people
coming
into
that
class?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
again
espouse
just
how
is
that
different
from
what
occurred
before
the
injunction?
what
did
you
do
before
the
injunction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
were
saying
is
that
there
is
a
burden
of
proof
every
week
on
part
of
the
claimant
and
must
meet
that
burden
of
proof?
chief

e.

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
the
eligibility
factors
are
the
same
in
this
kind
of
case
as
in
a
welfare
case
under
social
security?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
this
program
different
from
social
security
in
that
there
is
an
affirmative
burden
on
the
unemployed
worker
to
prove
every
week
that
he
is
complied
with
these
standards.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
required
to
come
in
with
new
proof
every
week
and
sign
a
new
certificate
every
week?
chief

warren
e.

that
is
not
true
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.

if
provided
--
provided
a
number
of
things
are
demonstrated
each
week?

semantics,
but
there
is
a
real
difference,
is
there
not,
between
the
unemployment
and
the
welfare
in
that
sense?
he
must
come
in
and
show
every
week
that
he
hasn't
refused
any
suitable
employment,
that
he
stands
ready,
able
and
willing
to
take
it,
that
he
hasn't
unable
to
get
it,
and
perhaps
several
other
things?

what
kind
of

does
the
welfare
recipient
sign
every

chief

warren
e.

well,
there
is
an
affirmative
decision
in,
the
other
is
a
negative?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
most
places,
their
welfare
check
is
mailed,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
any
case
is
the
unemployment
mailed?
chief

warren
e.

it
just
means
that
the
second
and
the
third
and
the
fourth
week,
he
doesn't
have
to
prove
as
many
things
as
he
did
the
first
week?
chief

warren
e.
burger
(voice

that
is
he
--
all
he
has
to
demonstrate
the
first
or
rather
from
the
second
week
on,
he
doesn't
need
to
re-demonstrate
the
nature
of
his
severance
from
his
employment?
chief

isn't
