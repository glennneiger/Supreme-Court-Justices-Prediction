can
you
name
the
person
who
have
subclass
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
mode
of
hearing
is
in
fact
given?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
gather
the
claimant
appealed
and
prevailed
on
the
appeal
and
benefits
were
resumed,
would
they
be
retroactive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
you
not
constrained
as
you
believe
you
are
by
the
injunction,
to
do
what
you
are
presently
doing?
i
take
it
you
would
back
to
that
procedure,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
gather
then
the
real
problem
here
is
whether
pending
decision
on
the
appeal
by
the
referee
and
benefit
shall
or
shall
not
be
terminated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
simply
not
paid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
benefits
are
paid
pending
a
decision
of
the
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
just
wondering
what's
maximum
number
of
weeks
in
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
any
idea
what
this
payment
of
benefits
pending
the
decision
of
the
referee
has
met
in
other
terms?
justice
william

california's

brief
suggests
50

justice
william
j.
brennan,

do
i
infer
from
what
you
said
that
now
that
you
are
paying
benefits
pending
the
appeal,
were
the
claimant
loses
an
effort
us
made
to
recoup
either
by
getting
the
money
back
or
perhaps
against
not
paying
future
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
how
successful
is
that
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
in

(inaudible)
exclusively
public

justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
wonder
why
that
is.
the
recoup
it
by
denying
future
benefits
until
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
she
was
initially
declared
eligible,
was
she?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

now
suppose
what
would
be
your
position
if
as
to
the
application
of
goldberg,
if
her
initial
determination
was
ineligible?
justice
william

what
were
you
thinking?
whats
would
be
the
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
know
we
were
not,
of
course,
in
goldberg.
i
just
wondered
what
would
be
your
view
of
the
application
of
principles
of
goldberg
to
a
situation
that
the
initial
determination
of
ineligibility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that's
right.
what
kind
of
hearing
that
they
required?
she
applies
for
benefits
and
there
is
a
determination
of
ineligibility.
would
you
challenge
the
hearing
under
goldberg
and
that
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
then
suppose
you
would
take
an

from
the
initial
determination
of

you
took
an
appeal,
would
you
–
the
claimant
be
entitled

decision
of
the
appeal?
justice

here,
however
the

is

william
j.
brennan,

and
determine
to
be

in
some

week?
justice
william

and
it
is
in
that
connect
that
you
mention
goldberg
claim?
justice
william

since
she
did
not

your

mr.

rehnquist's
question
is
how
can
you
prevail?
justice

suppose
we
let
it
stand,
how
do
you
stand
that?
