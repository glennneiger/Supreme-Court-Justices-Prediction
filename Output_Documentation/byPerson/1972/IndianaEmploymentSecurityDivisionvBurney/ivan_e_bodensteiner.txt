mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
question
of
mootness
this
case
comes
up
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
java
did.
it
comes
up
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
goldberg
did.
in
other
words,
in
goldberg
the
welfare
receipts
had
also
resume
receiving
benefits
and
had
their
hearing
before
the
case
reached
this
court
and
before
it
was
finally
decided
in
the
lower
court.
by
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
what
i
were
dealing
with
here,
the
problem
of
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
in
java
and
goldberg?
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
it
would
be
true
as
much
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
java.
in
other
words
in
java
presumably
mrs
java
could
at
some
point
in
the
future
have
another
claim.
here
also
mrs.
burney
could
have
another
claim.
in
the
area
of
(inaudiblt)
they
could
also
have
another
claim,
that
is
correct
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
pardon.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes,
and
as
we
do
it
as
always
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
well,
i
think
your
honor
after
the
--
after
the
injunction
was
issued,
it
did
cover
the
entire
class.
in
other
words
the
lower
court
defined
the
class
as
any
recipient
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
could
have,
except
that
after
the
injunction
was
issued
they
were
all
receiving
the
benefits
of
the
order.
in
other
words,
the
state
was
under
a
injunction
not
to
terminate
anyone
in
the
state
without
a
hearing.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
there
is
one
answer-
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
the
problem
is
that,
they
didn't
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
no
your
honor,
the
reason
no
one
intervened
is
because
they
were
receiving
the
benefits
of
the
order
and
as
long
as
their
benefits
were
not
being
terminated
without
a
hearing
they
had
no
reason
to
intervene.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
represent
mrs.
burney
and
all
members
of
the
class
as
defined
by
the
lower
court.
i
think
what
is
important
here
is
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with
as
the
court
was
dealing
with
in
goldberg,
the
question
is
when
do
you
get
a
hearing.
after
the
hearing
is
granted,
there
is
no
permanent
member,
no
permanent
class
representative.
the
problem
continues
as
was
indicated
earlier
that
if
the
order
is
vacated,
we
will
probably
be
back
in
the
same
circumstances,
since
it
will
be
necessary
to
re-litigate
the
matter.
so
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
mrs.
burney
has
in
fact
received
her
hearing,
as
in
fact
received
her
benefits,
the
case
is
though
is
still
ripe
and
there
is
still
a
controversy.
now
this
court
in
addition
to
java
and
goldberg
has
ruled
similarly
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases.
in
motor
coach
employees
versus
missouri
in
1963
involved
a
labor
dispute
and
a
seizure
of
property
by
the
governor
of
missouri.
the
property
was
released
before
the
appeal
or
reached
the
court
and
this
court
still
ruled
on
the
question.
likewise
in
carroll
versus
princess
anne
college
where
students
were
enjoined
from
rally.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
not
on
this
particular
claim.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
the
class
is
defined
as
all
present,
future
recipients
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits
in
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
she
is
not
eligible
on
the
basis
of
that
particular
claim.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
she
would
be
a
member
of
the
class
as
a
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
to
the
extent
that
it
covers
future
recipients
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
she
could
be.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
possibly.
alright,
turning
to
the
narrow
issue
presented
in
this
appeal,
the
question
is
very
simply
whether
unemployment
compensation
benefits
of
an
unemployed
worker
has
been
determined
eligible
for
benefits,
has
began
receiving
benefits
can
be
terminated
without
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing.
we
claim
there
is
a
right
to
such
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing
under
both
the
social
security
act
and
the
u.s
constitution.
the
case
can
be
decided
on
statutory
grounds
without
reaching
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
exactly
your
honor.
java
and
the
section
303
(a)
(1)
and
3
of
the
act.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
goldberg
on
the
constitutional
issue,
your
honor,
goldberg
reached
the
constitutional
issue
involved
in
the
welfare
situation.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
there
are
different
eligibility
criteria.
they
are
both
social
security
act
programs.
the
social
security
act
welfare
aspects
were
aimed
at
those
pretty
much
unable
to
work,
the
blind,
old,
disabled
and
children.
in
the
area
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
congress
was
dealing
with
those
who
were
working,
suddenly
out
of
work
for
a
short-term
period
and
congress
was
interested
in
taking
care
of
their
short-term
need
and
for
this
reason,
we
feel
the
case
is
even
stronger
on
the
constitutional
issue
in
goldberg.
we're
dealing
with
more
complex
factorial
issues.
the
interest
of
the
state
are
much
less
than
the
interest
of
the
state
that
were
explored
in
goldberg.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
one
reason,
your
honor.
another
reason
is
the
recouperment
rate.
as
our
brief
indicates,
the
state
recoups
over
72%
of
any
wrongful
payments.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
one
way,
your
honor
and
the
other
way
is
we
must
remember
we
are
dealing
with
people
who
are
working
as
opposed
to
welfare
where
this
court
recognized
that
there
would
in
effect
be
no
recoupment.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
now,
your
honor,
we're
not
dealing
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
claimants
found
initially
ineligible.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
no,
that
comports
with
the
procedure
outlined
in
java
for
determining
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
when
we
are
talking
about,
when
we're
talking
about
a
redetermination,
in
other
words,
when
we
are
talking
about
now
taking
that
recipient
off,
that
is
correct.
we
are
saying
that
the
procedure
does
not
comply
with
goldberg.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
would
i
agree
with
that?
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that,
i
assume
that
we
are
--
however,
we
are
saying
that
those
procedures
are
(1)
do
not
comply
with
goldberg;
(2)
they
are
not
sufficient
even
under
the
act
because
at
this
point,
we
must
remember
that
what
the
program
is
all
about,
the
program
as
pointed
out
in
java
is
to
get
benefits
to
unemployed
workers
when
they
are
unemployed
and
not
six
months
later
when
they
are
back
to
work.
so,
one
of
the
key
factors
here
is
that
the
program
was
designed
to
get
these
benefits
to
the
unemployed
as
soon
it
is
possible
after
they
lose
their
job.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
the
same
burden
rests
on
the
welfare
recipient,
your
honor,
as
pointed
out
in
java.
in
other
words
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
they
are
not
required
to
come
in
with
new
proof
to
the
extent
that
â€“
you
know,
they
have
to
demonstrate
compliance
with
the
rules
and
regulations.
in
other
words,
once
found
eligible
for
welfare,
you
continue
eligible
as
long
as
you
comply
with
the
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
it
is
true,
your
honor.
once
found
initially
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation,
you
are
found
eligible
for
a
set
number
of
weeks.
in
mrs.
burney's
case,
22
weeks.
now
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
provided
she
continues
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
similarly,
your
honor,
the
welfare
recipient,
for
example,
must
prove
he/she
is
not
working,
must
show
that
the
children
are
still
living
in
the
home.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
the
welfare
procedure,
the
welfare
system
does
not
use
the
same
procedure,
in
that
there
is
not
a
signing.
there
is
the
affirmative
duty
to
report
any
change.
in
addition,
there
is
the
periodic
interview,
just
as
there
is
an
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
think
they
are
well,
they
are
both
affirmative
to
the
extent
that
the
obligation
is
on
the
recipient
to
in
effect
say,
i
am
still
eligible.
the
difference
is
that
in
the
one
case,
the
claimant
comes
to
the
office
in
the
other
case,
the
claimant
is
in
many
states
mail
the
check.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
think
it
is
in
some
states,
your
honor.
now,
also
some
states,
it
may
be
like,
the
check
may
be
every
two
weeks
as
opposed
to
every
week.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
as
a
general
rule
in
indiana,
it
requires
personal
appearance
each
week
as
was
indicated
earlier.
in
some
cases,
there
can
be
--
the
certification
can
be
done
by
mail.
the
check
itself
is
actually
mailed
to
the
recipient.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
now,
in
this
case,
mrs.
burney
had
filed
--
was
employed,
involuntarily
lost
her
last
employment
and
filed
a
claim
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
as
pointed
out,
she
was
found
eligible
for
a
period
of
22
weeks.
she
received
these
benefits
for
a
period
of
10
weeks.
at
that
time,
she
was
advised
by
a
deputy
that
she
was
no
longer
eligible
and
the
benefits
would
be
terminated
and
were,
in
fact,
terminated
at
that
point.
now
mrs.
burney's
case
points
out
the
importance
of
a
hearing
in
this
context.
the
termination
was
based
on
an
alleged
refusal
to
accept
suitable
work
and
an
allegation
that
she
was
not
making
herself
available
for
work.
after
this
was
made,
she
requested
a
hearing.
three
months
later,
this
hearing
was
held.
at
this
time,
she
produced
evidence
that
she
did,
in
fact,
had
grounds
for
refusing
this
job,
that
she
was
in
fact
available
for
work
and
that
she
also
demonstrated
that
the
reason
she
could
not
accept
this
job
was
because
of
the
lack
of
proper
transportation,
the
lack
of
babysitting,
the
fact
that
the
job
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
the
fact
that
she
had
never
worked
in
night
shift,
the
fact
that
she
had
no
car,
no
public
transportation,
the
job
was
too
far
away
for
her
to
walk
to.
now,
when
the
division
was
forced
to
prove
its
assertion
that
she
had
in
fact
refused
suitable
work,
they
were
unable
to
do
so.
as
a
result,
the
review
board
ultimately
ruled
in
her
favor.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
was
a
different
situation
under
goldberg.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
think
a
footnote
in
goldberg
specifically
indicated,
they
were
not
dealing
with
the
initial
application
process
that
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
whether
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
denial?
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
no,
it
would
only
be
a
subsequent
hearing
in
that
case.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
not
if
initially
determined
ineligible.
we
are
keying
in
here
on
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
she
was
determined
eligible
for
a
set
number
of
weeks,
22
weeks
in
her
instance,
had
received
benefits
for
10
weeks
and
then
the
termination.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
class
was
limited
to
the
present,
future
employment
compensation
recipients
found
initially
eligible
which
as
described
in
java
is
the
critical
point
in
this
whole
procedure.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
the
initial
determination
of
eligibility.
in
other
words,
these
decisions
concerning
past
employment
are
made.
there
was
no
misconduct
in
her
leaving
the
job,
she
left
in
voluntarily.
at
that
point,
under
the
federal
law,
mrs.
burney
and
others
are
determined
eligible
for
a
number
of
weeks
and
that
eligibility
continues
so
long
as
mrs.
burney
complies
with
the
rules
and
regulations,
just
as
welfare
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes,
we
disagree
with
that.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
clearly
not
a
defensible
position
when
we
look
at
the
program.
as
was
pointed
out
in
java,
in
view
of
the
nature
of
those
program
to
get
benefits
to
the
unemployed
workers,
when
they
are
unemployed,
this
is
the
critical
point
in
the
procedure,
this
initial
determination
and
at
that
point,
certain
one
time
decisions
are
made
regarding
the
last
employment.
was
the
claimant
at
fault
in
leaving
that
employment?
does
the
claimant
have
the
required
ensured
status?
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
determined
eligible
as
i
indicated
for
the
set
number
of
weeks.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct
and
in
addition
he
doesn't
have
to
demonstrate
the
ensured
status
and
as
in
welfare
then
the
recipient
remains
eligible
as
long
as
the
rules
and
regulations
are
complied
with.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
one
aspect
of
the
initial
--
that
is
the
ensured
status
determination,
but
the
second
and
most
important
determination
is
an
individual
determination.
what
are
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
severance
of
last
employment?
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes,
but
i
think
this
is
simply
a
description
of
how
unemployment
compensation
benefits
are
paid.
in
other
words,
they
are
in
indiana
paid
by
the
week.
they
resemble
wages
as
closely
as
possible
and
as
indicated
earlier
after
this
initial
determination,
as
long
as
the
recipient
complies
with
the
rules
and
regulations,
there
is
the
expectancy
that
these
benefits
continue
through
that
definite
period
determined
initially
which
is
a
number
of
weeks.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
well,
i
think
in
dealing
with
torres,
first
thing
we
have
to
discuss
is
the
fact
that
the
case
is
actually
pending
before
this
court
now
on
a
petition
for
rehearing.
to
the
extent
that
torres
raises
the
same
issues
as
are
present
here,
we
disagree
with
the
lower
court
decision
in
torres.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
think
one
of
the,
as
indicated
and
it
is
still
pending
on
rehearing
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
affirmance
on
the
identical
issues
raised
by
plaintiff
dinger
we
would
disagree.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
insofar,
as
the
torres
decision
raises
the
same
issues
and
i
must
point
out,
there
are
some
distinctions,
especially
on
plaintiff
torres
where
there
was
a
very
unusual
circumstance
involving
the
initial
determination,
but
insofar
as
the
issue
is
exactly
the
same
as
raised
by
plaintiff
dinger,
we
would
disagree
with
that
affirmance.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
well,
i
think
the
--
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
also
that
that
was
a
summary
affirmance
and
the
court
did
not
consider
the
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
to
the
extent
that
the
issues
were
exactly
the
same.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
they
are
not
the
same
to
the
extent
that
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
torres
presented
a
very
unusual
circumstance
to
the
court.
plaintiff
torres
was
determined
initially
eligible
for
benefits
allegedly
without
the
employer
having
any
notice
of
the
application
and
therefore,
without
being
involved
in
the
critical
procedure
which
this
court
described
in
java.
so,
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
very
unusual
circumstance
which
we
clearly
don't
have
here.
here
the
employer
was
involved
in
that
initial
determination
of
eligibility.
now,
concerning
the
constitutional
issue.
in
goldberg,
this
court
found
that
welfare
benefits
could
not
be
summarily
terminated
without
affording
the
recipient
a
prior
evidential
hearing.
as
pointed
our
earlier,
this
case
is
uniquely
like
goldberg
and
in
many
respects,
it
is
even
stronger
than
goldberg.
for
example,
the
issues,
the
factual
determinations
to
be
made
in
unemployment
compensation
are
more
complex
than
those
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
welfare.
the
interest
of
the
state
in
a
summary
procedure
are
much
less
here
than
they
were
in
goldberg
because
of
the
recoupment
provisions.
as
pointed
out,
the
state
recoups
over
70%
of
any
wrongful
payments.
in
goldberg,
the
court
recognized
there
was
virtually
no
chance
of
recoupment.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes.
in
addition
here,
the
determination
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits
is
a
serious
deprivation
and
a
serious
loss
to
the
recipient
as
was
the
welfare,
even
though
initial
eligibility
is
not
based
on
an
individual
means
test.
java
and
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
recognized
that,
congress
intended
unemployment
compensation
to
meet
a
short
term
need.
just
as
welfare
provides
funds
for
the
old,
disabled,
blind
and
children,
unemployment
compensation
provides
funds
for
unemployed
workers,
during
their
short-term
unemployment.
now
as
pointed
out
in
the
legislative
history,
a
means
test
was
not
used
because
there
was
an
explicit
effort
to
avoid
the
stigma
of
welfare
and
the
welfare
mentality.
they
didn't
want
workers
to
get
into
the
--
relying
on
welfare
and
therefore,
not
look
for
jobs,
but
the
need
for
a
prior
evidential
hearing
is
very
great
here
because
of
the
complex
factual
issues.
once
a
person
is
in
this
continued
claim
status
after
the
initial
determination
of
eligibility
the
issues
that
come
up
subsequently
are
usually
as
in
mrs.
burney's
case,
issues
of
availability
and
issues
of
refusal
of
work.
indiana
courts
have
held
that
these
questions
involved
questions
of
fact
and
depend
on
the
circumstances
in
each
case.
for
example,
is
the
claimant
restricting
the
hours
of
work?
is
the
claimant
restricting
herself
to
certain
types
of
work?
is
the
claimant
looking
for
work?
is
the
job
suitable?
was
there
an
actual
offer
of
a
job?
is
the
job
safe?
is
there
transportation
to
the
job?
is
there
babysitting?
what
were
the
previous
work
habits?
is
the
person
physically
fit
to
attend,
to
work
at
this
job?
we
contend
that
reliable
answers
to
such
questions
can
best
be
obtained
at
an
evidential
hearing.
i
think
the
past
experience
of
the
division
with
a
near
50%
reversal
rate
indicates
that
there
are
--
in
the
past,
there
was
not
a
reliable
procedure.
as
pointed
out
earlier,
the
interest
of
the
state
here
are
much
less
than
in
the
welfare
situation.
the
ones
--
argument
advanced
by
the
state
and
the
brief
is
the
need
to
minimize
expenses.
well,
the
state
--
this
is
not
convincing
because
of
the
recoupment
procedures.
indiana
has
been
implementing
this
order
for
over
a
year
now
and
there
was
no
apparent
great
increase
in
the
costs.
the
issue,
the
numbers
presented
by
the
california
situation,
i
think
the
decision
there,
the
crow
decision
had
been
in
effect
for
over
a
year
and
i
think
those
figures
were
actually
rebutted
by
the
opposition
when
that
case
came
before
this
court
for
an
emergency
cert.
the
other
argument
advanced
by
the
state
is
that
this
is
going
to
create
administrative
chaos.
the
experience
is
that
it
simply
has
not.
they
have
simply
moved
their
referee
hearing
up
in
time
and
according
to
their
own
statistics
is
working
very
well.
so,
there
is
absolutely
no
demonstration
of
either
great
costs
or
administrative
chaos
here.
the
conclusion
is
as
congress
recognized,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
program
that
is
of
critical
importance
to
unemployed
workers
and
our
position
is
that
only
an
evidential
hearing
prior
to
a
termination
of
benefits
can
assure
that
the
purposes
of
this
program
to
get
benefits
to
unemployed
workers
can
adequately
be
met.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
question
of
mootness
this
case
comes
up
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
java
did.
it
comes
up
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
goldberg
did.
in
other
words,
in
goldberg
the
welfare
receipts
had
also
resume
receiving
benefits
and
had
their
hearing
before
the
case
reached
this
court
and
before
it
was
finally
decided
in
the
lower
court.
by
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
what
i
were
dealing
with
here,
the
problem
of
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
in
java
and
goldberg?
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
it
would
be
true
as
much
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
java.
in
other
words
in
java
presumably
mrs
java
could
at
some
point
in
the
future
have
another
claim.
here
also
mrs.
burney
could
have
another
claim.
in
the
area
of
(inaudiblt)
they
could
also
have
another
claim,
that
is
correct
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
pardon.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes,
and
as
we
do
it
as
always
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
well,
i
think
your
honor
after
the
--
after
the
injunction
was
issued,
it
did
cover
the
entire
class.
in
other
words
the
lower
court
defined
the
class
as
any
recipient
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
could
have,
except
that
after
the
injunction
was
issued
they
were
all
receiving
the
benefits
of
the
order.
in
other
words,
the
state
was
under
a
injunction
not
to
terminate
anyone
in
the
state
without
a
hearing.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
there
is
one
answer-
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
the
problem
is
that,
they
didn't
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
no
your
honor,
the
reason
no
one
intervened
is
because
they
were
receiving
the
benefits
of
the
order
and
as
long
as
their
benefits
were
not
being
terminated
without
a
hearing
they
had
no
reason
to
intervene.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
represent
mrs.
burney
and
all
members
of
the
class
as
defined
by
the
lower
court.
i
think
what
is
important
here
is
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with
as
the
court
was
dealing
with
in
goldberg,
the
question
is
when
do
you
get
a
hearing.
after
the
hearing
is
granted,
there
is
no
permanent
member,
no
permanent
class
representative.
the
problem
continues
as
was
indicated
earlier
that
if
the
order
is
vacated,
we
will
probably
be
back
in
the
same
circumstances,
since
it
will
be
necessary
to
re-litigate
the
matter.
so
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
mrs.
burney
has
in
fact
received
her
hearing,
as
in
fact
received
her
benefits,
the
case
is
though
is
still
ripe
and
there
is
still
a
controversy.
now
this
court
in
addition
to
java
and
goldberg
has
ruled
similarly
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases.
in
motor
coach
employees
versus
missouri
in
1963
involved
a
labor
dispute
and
a
seizure
of
property
by
the
governor
of
missouri.
the
property
was
released
before
the
appeal
or
reached
the
court
and
this
court
still
ruled
on
the
question.
likewise
in
carroll
versus
princess
anne
college
where
students
were
enjoined
from
rally.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
not
on
this
particular
claim.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
the
class
is
defined
as
all
present,
future
recipients
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits
in
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
she
is
not
eligible
on
the
basis
of
that
particular
claim.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
she
would
be
a
member
of
the
class
as
a
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
to
the
extent
that
it
covers
future
recipients
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
she
could
be.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
possibly.
alright,
turning
to
the
narrow
issue
presented
in
this
appeal,
the
question
is
very
simply
whether
unemployment
compensation
benefits
of
an
unemployed
worker
has
been
determined
eligible
for
benefits,
has
began
receiving
benefits
can
be
terminated
without
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing.
we
claim
there
is
a
right
to
such
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing
under
both
the
social
security
act
and
the
u.s
constitution.
the
case
can
be
decided
on
statutory
grounds
without
reaching
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
exactly
your
honor.
java
and
the
section
303
(a)
(1)
and
3
of
the
act.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
goldberg
on
the
constitutional
issue,
your
honor,
goldberg
reached
the
constitutional
issue
involved
in
the
welfare
situation.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
there
are
different
eligibility
criteria.
they
are
both
social
security
act
programs.
the
social
security
act
welfare
aspects
were
aimed
at
those
pretty
much
unable
to
work,
the
blind,
old,
disabled
and
children.
in
the
area
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
congress
was
dealing
with
those
who
were
working,
suddenly
out
of
work
for
a
short-term
period
and
congress
was
interested
in
taking
care
of
their
short-term
need
and
for
this
reason,
we
feel
the
case
is
even
stronger
on
the
constitutional
issue
in
goldberg.
we're
dealing
with
more
complex
factorial
issues.
the
interest
of
the
state
are
much
less
than
the
interest
of
the
state
that
were
explored
in
goldberg.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
one
reason,
your
honor.
another
reason
is
the
recouperment
rate.
as
our
brief
indicates,
the
state
recoups
over
72%
of
any
wrongful
payments.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
one
way,
your
honor
and
the
other
way
is
we
must
remember
we
are
dealing
with
people
who
are
working
as
opposed
to
welfare
where
this
court
recognized
that
there
would
in
effect
be
no
recoupment.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
now,
your
honor,
we're
not
dealing
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
claimants
found
initially
ineligible.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
no,
that
comports
with
the
procedure
outlined
in
java
for
determining
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
when
we
are
talking
about,
when
we're
talking
about
a
redetermination,
in
other
words,
when
we
are
talking
about
now
taking
that
recipient
off,
that
is
correct.
we
are
saying
that
the
procedure
does
not
comply
with
goldberg.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
would
i
agree
with
that?
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that,
i
assume
that
we
are
--
however,
we
are
saying
that
those
procedures
are
(1)
do
not
comply
with
goldberg;
(2)
they
are
not
sufficient
even
under
the
act
because
at
this
point,
we
must
remember
that
what
the
program
is
all
about,
the
program
as
pointed
out
in
java
is
to
get
benefits
to
unemployed
workers
when
they
are
unemployed
and
not
six
months
later
when
they
are
back
to
work.
so,
one
of
the
key
factors
here
is
that
the
program
was
designed
to
get
these
benefits
to
the
unemployed
as
soon
it
is
possible
after
they
lose
their
job.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
the
same
burden
rests
on
the
welfare
recipient,
your
honor,
as
pointed
out
in
java.
in
other
words
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
they
are
not
required
to
come
in
with
new
proof
to
the
extent
that
â€“
you
know,
they
have
to
demonstrate
compliance
with
the
rules
and
regulations.
in
other
words,
once
found
eligible
for
welfare,
you
continue
eligible
as
long
as
you
comply
with
the
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
it
is
true,
your
honor.
once
found
initially
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation,
you
are
found
eligible
for
a
set
number
of
weeks.
in
mrs.
burney's
case,
22
weeks.
now
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
provided
she
continues
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
similarly,
your
honor,
the
welfare
recipient,
for
example,
must
prove
he/she
is
not
working,
must
show
that
the
children
are
still
living
in
the
home.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
the
welfare
procedure,
the
welfare
system
does
not
use
the
same
procedure,
in
that
there
is
not
a
signing.
there
is
the
affirmative
duty
to
report
any
change.
in
addition,
there
is
the
periodic
interview,
just
as
there
is
an
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
think
they
are
well,
they
are
both
affirmative
to
the
extent
that
the
obligation
is
on
the
recipient
to
in
effect
say,
i
am
still
eligible.
the
difference
is
that
in
the
one
case,
the
claimant
comes
to
the
office
in
the
other
case,
the
claimant
is
in
many
states
mail
the
check.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
think
it
is
in
some
states,
your
honor.
now,
also
some
states,
it
may
be
like,
the
check
may
be
every
two
weeks
as
opposed
to
every
week.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
as
a
general
rule
in
indiana,
it
requires
personal
appearance
each
week
as
was
indicated
earlier.
in
some
cases,
there
can
be
--
the
certification
can
be
done
by
mail.
the
check
itself
is
actually
mailed
to
the
recipient.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
now,
in
this
case,
mrs.
burney
had
filed
--
was
employed,
involuntarily
lost
her
last
employment
and
filed
a
claim
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
as
pointed
out,
she
was
found
eligible
for
a
period
of
22
weeks.
she
received
these
benefits
for
a
period
of
10
weeks.
at
that
time,
she
was
advised
by
a
deputy
that
she
was
no
longer
eligible
and
the
benefits
would
be
terminated
and
were,
in
fact,
terminated
at
that
point.
now
mrs.
burney's
case
points
out
the
importance
of
a
hearing
in
this
context.
the
termination
was
based
on
an
alleged
refusal
to
accept
suitable
work
and
an
allegation
that
she
was
not
making
herself
available
for
work.
after
this
was
made,
she
requested
a
hearing.
three
months
later,
this
hearing
was
held.
at
this
time,
she
produced
evidence
that
she
did,
in
fact,
had
grounds
for
refusing
this
job,
that
she
was
in
fact
available
for
work
and
that
she
also
demonstrated
that
the
reason
she
could
not
accept
this
job
was
because
of
the
lack
of
proper
transportation,
the
lack
of
babysitting,
the
fact
that
the
job
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
the
fact
that
she
had
never
worked
in
night
shift,
the
fact
that
she
had
no
car,
no
public
transportation,
the
job
was
too
far
away
for
her
to
walk
to.
now,
when
the
division
was
forced
to
prove
its
assertion
that
she
had
in
fact
refused
suitable
work,
they
were
unable
to
do
so.
as
a
result,
the
review
board
ultimately
ruled
in
her
favor.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
was
a
different
situation
under
goldberg.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
think
a
footnote
in
goldberg
specifically
indicated,
they
were
not
dealing
with
the
initial
application
process
that
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
whether
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
denial?
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
no,
it
would
only
be
a
subsequent
hearing
in
that
case.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
not
if
initially
determined
ineligible.
we
are
keying
in
here
on
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
she
was
determined
eligible
for
a
set
number
of
weeks,
22
weeks
in
her
instance,
had
received
benefits
for
10
weeks
and
then
the
termination.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
class
was
limited
to
the
present,
future
employment
compensation
recipients
found
initially
eligible
which
as
described
in
java
is
the
critical
point
in
this
whole
procedure.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
the
initial
determination
of
eligibility.
in
other
words,
these
decisions
concerning
past
employment
are
made.
there
was
no
misconduct
in
her
leaving
the
job,
she
left
in
voluntarily.
at
that
point,
under
the
federal
law,
mrs.
burney
and
others
are
determined
eligible
for
a
number
of
weeks
and
that
eligibility
continues
so
long
as
mrs.
burney
complies
with
the
rules
and
regulations,
just
as
welfare
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes,
we
disagree
with
that.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
clearly
not
a
defensible
position
when
we
look
at
the
program.
as
was
pointed
out
in
java,
in
view
of
the
nature
of
those
program
to
get
benefits
to
the
unemployed
workers,
when
they
are
unemployed,
this
is
the
critical
point
in
the
procedure,
this
initial
determination
and
at
that
point,
certain
one
time
decisions
are
made
regarding
the
last
employment.
was
the
claimant
at
fault
in
leaving
that
employment?
does
the
claimant
have
the
required
ensured
status?
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
determined
eligible
as
i
indicated
for
the
set
number
of
weeks.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
correct
and
in
addition
he
doesn't
have
to
demonstrate
the
ensured
status
and
as
in
welfare
then
the
recipient
remains
eligible
as
long
as
the
rules
and
regulations
are
complied
with.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
that
is
one
aspect
of
the
initial
--
that
is
the
ensured
status
determination,
but
the
second
and
most
important
determination
is
an
individual
determination.
what
are
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
severance
of
last
employment?
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes,
but
i
think
this
is
simply
a
description
of
how
unemployment
compensation
benefits
are
paid.
in
other
words,
they
are
in
indiana
paid
by
the
week.
they
resemble
wages
as
closely
as
possible
and
as
indicated
earlier
after
this
initial
determination,
as
long
as
the
recipient
complies
with
the
rules
and
regulations,
there
is
the
expectancy
that
these
benefits
continue
through
that
definite
period
determined
initially
which
is
a
number
of
weeks.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
well,
i
think
in
dealing
with
torres,
first
thing
we
have
to
discuss
is
the
fact
that
the
case
is
actually
pending
before
this
court
now
on
a
petition
for
rehearing.
to
the
extent
that
torres
raises
the
same
issues
as
are
present
here,
we
disagree
with
the
lower
court
decision
in
torres.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
i
think
one
of
the,
as
indicated
and
it
is
still
pending
on
rehearing
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
affirmance
on
the
identical
issues
raised
by
plaintiff
dinger
we
would
disagree.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
insofar,
as
the
torres
decision
raises
the
same
issues
and
i
must
point
out,
there
are
some
distinctions,
especially
on
plaintiff
torres
where
there
was
a
very
unusual
circumstance
involving
the
initial
determination,
but
insofar
as
the
issue
is
exactly
the
same
as
raised
by
plaintiff
dinger,
we
would
disagree
with
that
affirmance.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
well,
i
think
the
--
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
also
that
that
was
a
summary
affirmance
and
the
court
did
not
consider
the
--
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
to
the
extent
that
the
issues
were
exactly
the
same.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
they
are
not
the
same
to
the
extent
that
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
torres
presented
a
very
unusual
circumstance
to
the
court.
plaintiff
torres
was
determined
initially
eligible
for
benefits
allegedly
without
the
employer
having
any
notice
of
the
application
and
therefore,
without
being
involved
in
the
critical
procedure
which
this
court
described
in
java.
so,
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
very
unusual
circumstance
which
we
clearly
don't
have
here.
here
the
employer
was
involved
in
that
initial
determination
of
eligibility.
now,
concerning
the
constitutional
issue.
in
goldberg,
this
court
found
that
welfare
benefits
could
not
be
summarily
terminated
without
affording
the
recipient
a
prior
evidential
hearing.
as
pointed
our
earlier,
this
case
is
uniquely
like
goldberg
and
in
many
respects,
it
is
even
stronger
than
goldberg.
for
example,
the
issues,
the
factual
determinations
to
be
made
in
unemployment
compensation
are
more
complex
than
those
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
welfare.
the
interest
of
the
state
in
a
summary
procedure
are
much
less
here
than
they
were
in
goldberg
because
of
the
recoupment
provisions.
as
pointed
out,
the
state
recoups
over
70%
of
any
wrongful
payments.
in
goldberg,
the
court
recognized
there
was
virtually
no
chance
of
recoupment.
mr.
ivan
e.
bodensteiner
yes.
in
addition
here,
the
determination
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits
is
a
serious
deprivation
and
a
serious
loss
to
the
recipient
as
was
the
welfare,
even
though
initial
eligibility
is
not
based
on
an
individual
means
test.
java
and
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
recognized
that,
congress
intended
unemployment
compensation
to
meet
a
short
term
need.
just
as
welfare
provides
funds
for
the
old,
disabled,
blind
and
children,
unemployment
compensation
provides
funds
for
unemployed
workers,
during
their
short-term
unemployment.
now
as
pointed
out
in
the
legislative
history,
a
means
test
was
not
used
because
there
was
an
explicit
effort
to
avoid
the
stigma
of
welfare
and
the
welfare
mentality.
they
didn't
want
workers
to
get
into
the
--
relying
on
welfare
and
therefore,
not
look
for
jobs,
but
the
need
for
a
prior
evidential
hearing
is
very
great
here
because
of
the
complex
factual
issues.
once
a
person
is
in
this
continued
claim
status
after
the
initial
determination
of
eligibility
the
issues
that
come
up
subsequently
are
usually
as
in
mrs.
burney's
case,
issues
of
availability
and
issues
of
refusal
of
work.
indiana
courts
have
held
that
these
questions
involved
questions
of
fact
and
depend
on
the
circumstances
in
each
case.
for
example,
is
the
claimant
restricting
the
hours
of
work?
is
the
claimant
restricting
herself
to
certain
types
of
work?
is
the
claimant
looking
for
work?
is
the
job
suitable?
was
there
an
actual
offer
of
a
job?
is
the
job
safe?
is
there
transportation
to
the
job?
is
there
babysitting?
what
were
the
previous
work
habits?
is
the
person
physically
fit
to
attend,
to
work
at
this
job?
we
contend
that
reliable
answers
to
such
questions
can
best
be
obtained
at
an
evidential
hearing.
i
think
the
past
experience
of
the
division
with
a
near
50%
reversal
rate
indicates
that
there
are
--
in
the
past,
there
was
not
a
reliable
procedure.
as
pointed
out
earlier,
the
interest
of
the
state
here
are
much
less
than
in
the
welfare
situation.
the
ones
--
argument
advanced
by
the
state
and
the
brief
is
the
need
to
minimize
expenses.
well,
the
state
--
this
is
not
convincing
because
of
the
recoupment
procedures.
indiana
has
been
implementing
this
order
for
over
a
year
now
and
there
was
no
apparent
great
increase
in
the
costs.
the
issue,
the
numbers
presented
by
the
california
situation,
i
think
the
decision
there,
the
crow
decision
had
been
in
effect
for
over
a
year
and
i
think
those
figures
were
actually
rebutted
by
the
opposition
when
that
case
came
before
this
court
for
an
emergency
cert.
the
other
argument
advanced
by
the
state
is
that
this
is
going
to
create
administrative
chaos.
the
experience
is
that
it
simply
has
not.
they
have
simply
moved
their
referee
hearing
up
in
time
and
according
to
their
own
statistics
is
working
very
well.
so,
there
is
absolutely
no
demonstration
of
either
great
costs
or
administrative
chaos
here.
the
conclusion
is
as
congress
recognized,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
program
that
is
of
critical
importance
to
unemployed
workers
and
our
position
is
that
only
an
evidential
hearing
prior
to
a
termination
of
benefits
can
assure
that
the
purposes
of
this
program
to
get
benefits
to
unemployed
workers
can
adequately
be
met.
thank
you,
your
honors.
