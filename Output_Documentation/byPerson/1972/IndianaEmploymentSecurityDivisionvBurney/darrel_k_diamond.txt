mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
by
the
indiana
employment
security
division
presents
the
issue
of
validity
of
certain
practices
used
by
the
division
in
determining
the
eligibility
of
claimants
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
these
practices
which
are
called
for
by
the
indiana
law,
were
held
by
a
three-judge
district
court
not
to
comply
with
requirements
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
are
you
referring
here
mr.
chief
justice
to
mrs.
burney's
case
if
it
is
a
general
rule?
i
am
afraid,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
in
this
case
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
they
had
in
fact
been
granted
much
earlier
on
the
basis
of
the
preliminary
injunction
and
temporary
restraining
order
issued
by
the
district
court.
the
facts
of
mrs.
burney's
particular
case
were
moot
well
before
the
district
court
entered
its
judgment.
in
fact,
it
became
moot
at
the
time
the
referee
providing
the
type
of
hearing
which
was
required
by
the
district
court
order
determined
that
she
was
not
eligible
for
benefits.
in
this
case,
the
first
determination
by
the
deputy
was
that
mrs.
burney
was
not
eligible
for
benefits
in
that
she
was
unduly
restricting
the
hours
in
which
she
was
available
for
work.
the
referee
after
a
full
hearing
upheld
that
determination.
the
review
board
after
going
over
the
case,
hearing
argument
determined
that
the
restriction
upon
her
hours
of
possible
work
was
not
so
severe
as
to
indicate
that
she
was
not
available
for
work
within
the
statutory
meaning.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
at
that
time
her
case
was
completed.
there
was
no
appeal
to
the
indiana
court
of
appeals
on
this.
so,
mrs.
burney's
case
was
moot
at
this
point
in
the
same
way
that
the
java
case,
also
an
unemployment
compensation
case,
was
moot
well
before
it
ever
came
before
the
courts
for
final
decision.
this
was
a
class
action,
although
her
particular
claim
was
not
designated
as
such.
the
district
court
clearly
stated
that
it
was
ruling
on
behalf
of
mrs.
burney
and
of
a
subclass
within
the
original
case.
in
the
original
case,
there
were
actually
two
questions.
one
being
precisely
identical
to
the
java
issue
and
the
other
mrs.
burney's
case.
so
the
district
court
divided
this
into
two
subclasses
while
mrs.
burney's
particular
case
was
moot
at
a
very
early
stage
this
is
a
class
action
within
the
scope
of
the
district
court
opinion.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes
she
was.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
correct.
she
intervened
in
the
complaint
which
was
filed
by
mr.
hayatt.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
she
was
an
individual
intervener
within
the
scope
of
her
case.
however,
the
district
court
in
its
order
spoke
of
its
ruling
as
going
to
a
subclass
within
the
initial
order.
so
we
are
really
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
no,
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
can
not
give
you
the
exact
language,
but
it
was
all
persons
who
had
initially
been
determined
eligible
for
benefits
and
then
at
a
later
time
had
been
administratively
determined
no
longer
to
be
eligible.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
in
fact
her
benefit
eligibility
period
ran
out
some
time
ago,
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
there
it
was
none.
in
considering
the
question
of
determination
of
the
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
cannot
say
definitely.
we
thought
it
would
be
better
to
see
if
we
get
determination
because
this
was
fair
representation
and
the
fact
that
the
district
court
order
did
not
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
individual
case.
district
court
order
was
very
general.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
this
would
not
be
an
advisory
opinion
your
honor
because
it
is
an
injunction
which
is
against
the
division.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
at
first
point
the
controversy
would
be
between
the
division
and
all
persons
within
the
subclass
as
designated
by
the
district
court.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
of
that
of
any
such
case.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
cannot
give
a
firm
answer.
this
is
an
in
forma
pauperis
appeal
of
course.
so
the
question
of
cost
may
be
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
originally
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
such
party
in
this
case.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
if
the
injunction
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes,
as
far
as
the
indiana
procedure
is
concerned
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
one
way
or
the
other
because
there
are
other
cases
which
would
have
to
be
decided
but
presenting
exactly
the
same
issue.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
governing
future
cases
and
the
cases
by
which
we
are
now
operating.
if
this
were
dismissed
and
the
district
court
judgment
were
held
of
no
effect.
then
the
initial
effect
would
be
exactly
the
same
unless
of
course
a
new
action
were
brought.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes,
your
honor,
since
that
time
when
a
deputy
has
made
a
determination
of
ineligibility,
if
the
claimant
files
a
notice
of
appeal
benefits
are
still
paid
until
the
referee
hears
it
and
enters
a
decision
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
within
the
terms
--
at
the
present
time
if
this
were
vacated
it
would
go
and
go
back
our
assume
to
the
prior
practices,
this
would
be
a
decision
made
by
the
division
and
not
by
our
office
and
then
the
class
would
come
back
into
and
the
injunction
was
no
longer
in
effect.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
true
because
we
would
like
to
follow
district
court
injunctions.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
would
assume
so
because
i
would
assume
the
decision
is
not
my
to
make,
but
as
soon
as
division
would
then
go
back
to
something
like
its
prior
practices.
if
i
may
then,
deal
briefly
with
the
types
of
determinations
which
are
involved
here.
in
determining
a
claim
for
benefits,
there
are
basically
three
determinations
to
be
made,
breaking
this
down
into
three
as
far
as
appropriate
analysis,
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
are
only
two.
the
first
of
these
is
the
determination
of
insured
status.
this
is
merely
whether
the
claimant
has
had
enough
work
and
has
earned
wage
credits
in
a
covered
employment
to
be
eligible
for
benefits
if
he
meets
the
eligibility
requirements.
this
determination
says
nothing
about
whether
the
person
is
eligible
or
not
eligible.
in
fact,
a
person
can
even
request
this
determination
when
he
is
still
employed.
the
second
determination
goes
to
eligibility
and
this,
i
have
broken
down
into
two
parts.
the
first
issue,
going
to
the
reason
for
termination
of
the
prior
employment,
that
is
basically
whether
the
termination
was
attributable
to
the
employer
or
to
the
employee.
the
third
issue,
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
continuing
question
of
the
conduct
of
the
claimant
during
the
period
of
the
unemployment.
each
week,
the
claimant
is
required
to
well,
continue
to
be
unemployed,
to
be
able
to
work,
to
be
available
for
work,
to
be
making
an
independent
effort
to
secure
work,
to
not
have
refused
an
offer
of
a
suitable
job
or
not
have
refused
instructions
by
division
to
apply
for
a
job
which
would
be
suitable.
this
determination
is
made
each
week
by
the
division
and
it
is
on
this
basis
that
the
determination
of
eligibility
for
that
week
is
made.
there
is
never
any
determination
by
the
division
which
would
have
any
effect
for
any
week
prior
--
past
the
time
of
that
week.
this
is
like,
in
a
sense,
pay
for
looking
for
work
and
you
don't
get
paid
until
after
you
have
done
the
job.
when
a
person
comes
in
each
week
to
present
his
claim,
he
is
required
to
establish
that
he
has
met
these
criteria.
this
establishment
may
come
about
by
his
certification,
upon
the
voucher
form
that
he
has
met
these
requirements.
it
may
come
by
an
interview
or
a
hearing,
an
interview
type
hearing
with
a
claims
deputy.
this
hearing
would
be
basically
similar
to
the
hearing
on
an
initial
claim
which
was
described
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
the
case
of
california
department
of
human
resources
development
versus
java.
the
party,
the
claimant
is
called
in,
the
question
which
raises
the
doubt
is
discussed.
if
there
is
anyone
else
who
would
have
information,
the
deputy
finds
that
information
and
he
reaches
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
person
was
eligible
for
that
particular
week.
that
decision
is
as
much
an
initial
decision
in
that
sense
as
is
the
first
week.
the
only
difference
being
that
in
the
normal
situation,
it
is
not
necessary
each
week
to
determine
the
questions
of
why
the
previous
employment
was
terminated.
in
this
case,
mrs.
burney
was
determined
by
the
division,
by
the
deputy
not
to
be
available
for
work
in
that
she
was
unduly
restricting
the
hours
for
which
she
was
available
for
work
and
the
other
case
was
presenting
the
same
issue,
in
the
new
york
case
of
torres,
there
was
the
plaintiff
mr.
dinger
who
was
found
by
the
division
not
to
be
making
an
effort
to
secure
work.
in
the
vermont
case
of
wheeler
versus
vermont,
there
was
a
determination
there
that
the
claimant
had
refused
to
seek
work
when
directed
by
the
division.
in
the
california
case,
mrs.
crow
was
determined
to
have
refused
an
offer
of
suitable
work.
when
these
questions
arose,
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
determination
of
the
prior
week's
conduct
because
each
of
these
questions
is
a
condition
precedent
to
eligibility
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
this
is
a
different
type
of
system
than
the
welfare
system,
in
which
there
is
an
initial
determination
of
status
such
as
a
family
has
a
child
or
children
who
are
dependent
within
the
definition
of
42
u.s.c
section
606,
that
is,
a
needy
child
living
with
a
designated
relative
who
is
deprived
of
the
parental
support
of
at
least
one
parent.
in
those
cases,
once
a
determination
is
made,
it
continues
in
effect
and
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
hearing
because
a
prior
determination
having
continuing
effect
is
now
being
changed.
the
welfare
recipient
has
no
such
affirmative
duties
to
go
out
and
look
for
work,
to
be
available
for
work
and
not
to
review
his
work.
so,
we
have
a
completely
different
situation
here.
the
welfare
situation
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
at
all.
in
looking
to
this
court's
decision
in
java
last
year
which
was
held
by
the
district
court
to
be
dispositive
of
the
issue,
i
believe
that
the
rule
of
law
of
the
java
court
actually
supports
the
position
of
the
division
in
this
case.
in
java,
you
had
an
initial
determination
by
the
deputy
in
the
california
department,
as
to
the
eligibility
of
a
particular
claimant.
after
that
determination
had
been
made,
one
of
the
parties
to
that
case
filed
a
notice
appeal
and
that
notice
or
appeal
was
sufficient
in
itself
to
call
for
determination
of
benefits,
even
though
in
that
case,
the
division
had
determined
that
the
benefits
were
due.
so,
you
were
allowing
a
party
to
upset
the
decision
of
the
impartial
agency.
in
this
case,
we
merely
have
the
other
party
seeking
to
overturn
the
decision
of
the
impartial
agency
that
benefits
are
not
due,
this
is
merely
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
i
would
emphasize
in
this
respect
that
the
indiana
employment
security
division
is
an
impartial
arbiter
in
these
cases.
the
state
of
indiana
and
the
division
have
no
interest
in
whether
or
not
these
payments
are
made,
in
the
sense
that
the
money
used
to
pay
these
benefits
comes
from
employers
and
not
from
the
state
treasury.
the
administrative
expenses
so
long
as
the
plan
is
held
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
federal
law
are
paid
by
the
federal
government.
the
interest
of
the
state
agency
is
merely
in
having
a
workable
system
in
which
the
authority
of
the
impartial
arbiter
is
upheld
and
the
duties
placed
upon
claimants
by
the
social
security
act
and
the
state
unemployment
compensation
laws
are
met.
when
congress
passed
the
provision
to
the
social
security
law
dealing
with
the
questions
of
unemployment
compensation,
they
had
before
it
a
general
outline
of
what
unemployment
compensation
plan
would
be
like
and
this
included
these
issues.
the
district
of
columbia
unemployment
compensation
code
which
was
then
passed
by
congress,
includes
the
same
provisions.
so
as
a
result
we
have
the
determination
by
the
agency
that
a
party
is
not
eligible
for
benefits.
we
have
a
claimant
for
whatever
reason,
in
most
cases
probably
because
of
a
sincere
questions
as
to
the
fact
but
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
java
case
possibly
by
an
arbitrary
desire
or
merely
by
a
desire
to
apply
short
run
benefit
may
file
a
frivolous
appeal.
there
is
no
way
to
determine
this
until
the
referee
decision
has
been
made
and
in
some
cases
on
from
there
to
the
review
board
and
from
there
to
the
indiana
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
of
due
process
has
been
presented
in
this
case.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
this
issue
in
this
case
except
to
in
the
following
way.
the
district
court
did
not
rule
on
the
due
process
issue
presented
under
goldberg
versus
kelly.
it
did,
however,
require
the
division
to
provide
a
prior
due
process
hearing
and
did
not
explain
what
that
hearing
should
consist
of.
division
filed
a
motion
for
amendment
of
judgment
to
show
what
that
hearing
would
consist
of
and
the
district
court
refused
that
motion
being
unable
or
unwilling
to
say
what
a
due
process
hearing
is.
i
believe
it's
clear
from
the
law
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
due
process
hearing
in
the
sense
of
a
specific
set
of
requirements.
due
process
is
a
much
more
general
phrase
which
would
vary
from
period
to
period
and
from
case
to
case.
what
is
due
process
in
one
situation
would
not
be
due
process
in
another.
and
what
maybe
a
denial
of
due
process
in
one
situation
would
provide
due
process
in
another
situation.
therefore,
it's
necessary
to
look
at
this
question
within
the
realm
of
the
unemployment
compensation
and
not
in
the
question
of
welfare
even
though
both
of
these
are
programs
under
the
social
security
act
and
determine
whether
the
deputy
determination
would
be
a
proper
determination
in
this
case.
whether
the
deputy
determination
is
itself
a
due
process
hearing
within
the
scope
of
the
district
court
order.
since
the
district
court
refused
or
wasn't
able
to
clarify
that
order,
the
division
felt
it
was
necessary
to
give
it
the
strictest
possible
interpretation
because
they
didn't
know
what
might
put
them
in
contempt
of
court.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
since
the
injunction
was
presented,
there
is
the
deputy
determination
which
is
basically
the
same
question
--
the
same
procedure
as
was
presented
in
the
java
case,
that
is
the
deputy
interviews
the
claimant,
interviews
other
persons
having
information
about
it.
now
in
the
above
both
the
cases
for
example
frequently
there
will
be
no
employer
party
because
the
prior
employer
would
have
no
way
of
having
knowledge
as
to
the
behavior
of
the
claimant
after
this
period.
after
all
of
this
information
is
presented
and
in
most
of
these
cases
the
information
comes
exclusively
from
the
claimant
himself,
the
deputy
determines
the
facts
and
determines
whether
that
brings
a
person
within
one
of
the
limitations,
whether
in
that
situation
the
person
is
eligible.
however,
since
the
district
court
injunction
was
entered,
the
deputy
determination
did
made
in
the
same
way.
however
the
deputy
determination
of
ineligibility
is
not
given
effect
if
the
claimant
expresses
a
desire
to
appeal
to
a
referee,
but
rather
benefits
are
paid
despite
the
fact
that
there
has
never
been
a
determination
of
eligibility
for
that
period
until
a
referee
hearing
and
the
written
formal
referee
opinion
is
handed
down.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
before
the
injunction
when
the
deputy
made
determination,
that's
if
the
deputy
determined
that
then
--
the
claimant
was
not
eligible
for
benefits,
benefits
are
not
paid
for
that
week.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
they
would
be
retroactive.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
believe
that
it
would
go
back
to
that
procedure.
this
is
--
that
rule
made
by
the
division
court
is
not
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
well,
that
is
basically
the
question.
however,
i
would
have
to
take
issue
with
the
statement
you
used
in
that
there
is
no
termination
of
benefits.
this
is
a
one
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
most
clearly.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
simply
–
except
there
has
never
done
any
determination
that
the
claimant
was
eligible
for
any
period
other
than
past
weeks
and
the
question
of
what
happened
in
past
weeks
does
not
control
what
happens
in
the
week
in
question?
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes.
he
must
come
in
and
certify
has
met
these
requirements.
he
must
fall
of
the
certification
or
if
it's
a
time
when
there
is
interview,
at
that
time
they
will
discuss
what
he
has
been
doing
during
the
time,
what
efforts
he
has
made
to
secure
work,
what
he
is
been
doing.
at
that
time
also
they
might
suggest
other
ways
of
finding
work,
perhaps
looking
in
a
slightly
different
field,
checking
to
see
if
there
is
some
other
type
of
skill
which
the
employee
--
which
the
claimant
has,
which
would
enable
him
to
find
work
in
a
slightly
different
field.
this
is
not
merely
an
attempt
by
the
division
to
do
a
person
out
of
benefits.
it's
an
attempt
to
find
out
whether
the
person
meets
the
criteria
and
try
to
find
a
way
to
find
him
a
job.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
as
i
understand
it,
i
believe
it
is
unlawful
for
the
employer
to
attempt
to
deduct
any
of
this
contribution
from
the
employee's
wages.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
it
is
not
a
contributory
fund.
this
is
simply
a
payment
by
the
employer
himself.
no
claimant
money
involved,
no
state
money
involved.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes
there
is.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
believe
it
is
10
days
in
the
normal
case.
in
certain
cases
where
you
have
an
interstate
claimant
and
the
like,
it
maybe
15
days,
but
ordinarily
the
appeal
must
be
presented
within
that
period
of
time
and
under
indiana
law
that
time
limit
is
jurisdictional
for
consideration
by
the
next
highest
club.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
this
varies
according
to
the
staffing
of
the
department
and
according
to
the
case
load
at
the
time.
at
the
time
that
mrs.
burney's
case
arose,
it
was
a
long
period
of
time,
perhaps
10-15
weeks.
at
the
present
time,
most
--
about
half
of
the
cases
or
more
--
are
being
decided
by
the
referee
within
30
days.
this
is
because
primarily
of
an
increase
in
the
staffing
and
partly
because
this
is
a
little
bit
soccer
time
for
claims,
not
has
been
any
claims
are
being
presented.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
before
the
deputy
--
there
were
two
questions
unless
i
fail
to
understand
all
the
--
both
of
them?
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
the
injunction
of
the
district
court
did
not
affect
the
referee
hearing.
this
is
an
administrative
hearing
of
counsel.
the
parties
are
given
notice.
they
are
told
that
they
may
bring
witnesses.
they
may
bring
counsel
or
any
other
person
to
assist
them
in
presenting
their
case.
if
a
party
is
not
represented
the
referee
is
given
the
duty
of
helping
them
present
their
case
of
bringing
out
all
the
facts
which
might
be
relevant
to
it.
it
is
like
a
court
hearing
in
a
sense,
except
that
the
referee
has
greater
duties
to
make
sure
that
the
facts
are
presented
then
would
an
impartial
judge
who
merely
sits
back
and
decides
what
the
case
is
like.
it
might
be
like
a
smoke
flame
cordon
in
many
areas.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
but
that
that
the
referee
hearing
would
provide
the
due
process
elements
under
goldberg.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
this
was
true
both
before
and
after.
the
practices
of
the
division
had
not
been
changed
by
the
injunction
except
to
the
extent
that
the
determination
by
the
deputy
of
non
eligibility
is
no
longer
given
effect.
that
is
the
only
difference
in
the
procedure
at
this
time.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
the
benefit
year
can
be
up
to
52
weeks,
if
there
is
a
situation
--
a
substantial
unemployment
then
under
a
federal
program.
there
can
be
an
extended
benefit
period
beyond
this.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
do
not
have
those
figures
for
indiana.
i
don't
believe
those
figures
have
been
calculated.
indiana
is
also
in
this
regard
a
small
state.
we
have
only
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
believe
the
information
i
received
from
their
office
when
last
talking
to
them
was
that
the
an
affidavit
in
the
record
in
the
co-case
in
california
indicated
that
the
total
cost
be
something
like
the
167
million
dollars
there.
this
was
in
extra
employer
contributions
and
extra
administrative
expenses.
if
the
benefits
are
found
to
be
paid
erroneously
and
is
necessary
to
try
to
bring
them
back
by
either
collecting
the
money
or
not
paying
for
future
weeks'
of
eligibility.
this
requires
extra
administrative
help.
for
example,
the
indiana
polis
local
claims
office;
before
the
injunction
had
one
worker
spending
about
half
of
his
time
on
recouping
erroneous
payments.
now
this
one
office
has
two
employees
full
time
on
this
case
and
this
is
only
the
one
local
office.
so
there
is
an
extra
administrative
load
which
the
expense
of
this
is
probably
on
the
united
states
government
and
not
upon
the
state
government,
but
it
is
an
extra
administrative
expense
and
extra
administrative
burdens.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
correct.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
--
i
don't
know
that
the
figures
are
available
for
this
latest
period.
previously
they
were
receiving
kind
of
big
payment
i
think
about
60%-70%,
i
am
not
sure
of
the
exact
figure
but
as
i
remember
it's
in
that
area.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes,
your
honor.
when
they
claimants
comes
in
to
the
office.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes
he
comes
in
each
week
(voice
overlap)
for
benefits.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
only
in
exceptional
cases
where
the
agency
will
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes
the
voucher
form
which
he
fills
out
is
a
blank
ibm
card
which
would
be
punched
later
and
includes
the
statement,
“i
hereby
certify
that
i
fulfill
the
registration
for
work
requirements,
that
during
the
compensable
week
covered
by
this
voucher
i
was
unemployed,
physically
fit
available
for
and
actively
seeking
work
except
as
noted
herein.”
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes,
periodically.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
if
the
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
there
was
an
interview
and
it
was
at
the
interview
that
the
information
came
out.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
well
if
the
person
refuses
to
sign
a
certification
and
there
can
be
no
payment
because
this
voucher
must
be
signed
and
sent
in
and
is
from
this
voucher
that
payment
is
made.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
if
there
is
a
question
which
arises
the
claims
taker
will
then
refer
that
to
a
deputy
for
the
full
interview
hearing
type.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
am
sure
it
will
be
unusual,
but
i
was
told
that
everything
happens
and
it
does
happen
except
it
will
be
unusual
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
if
there
is
a
question
ordinarily
any
time
the
claims
taker
presents,
sees
any
issue
this
is
to
be
referred
to
a
deputy
for
a
full
interview
to
find
out
what
the
situation
is.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
it
has
been
about
the
same.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
no
significant
change,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
in
relation
to
these
statistics
that
i
think
i
covered
this
in
reply
brief,
but
i
don't
think
these
are
really
relevant
to
the
case
and
in
any
event
these
are
surely
a
somewhat
comparable
reversal
at
the
review
board
of
the
referee
and
in
addition
i
would
point
out
to
the
java
decision
when
this
court
spoke
with
an
air
of
approval
it
seems
to
me
of
the
java
procedure,
it
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
in
that
case,
footnote
7
of
the
number
of
reversals
from
the
deputy
to
the
referee
and
it
was
just
looking
at
the
referee
somewhere
in
the
30%
area.
so
this
apparently,
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
it
was
covered
in
java,
but
this
was
before
record
in
java
and
the
court
still
spoke
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
by
the
indiana
employment
security
division
presents
the
issue
of
validity
of
certain
practices
used
by
the
division
in
determining
the
eligibility
of
claimants
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
these
practices
which
are
called
for
by
the
indiana
law,
were
held
by
a
three-judge
district
court
not
to
comply
with
requirements
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
are
you
referring
here
mr.
chief
justice
to
mrs.
burney's
case
if
it
is
a
general
rule?
i
am
afraid,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
in
this
case
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
they
had
in
fact
been
granted
much
earlier
on
the
basis
of
the
preliminary
injunction
and
temporary
restraining
order
issued
by
the
district
court.
the
facts
of
mrs.
burney's
particular
case
were
moot
well
before
the
district
court
entered
its
judgment.
in
fact,
it
became
moot
at
the
time
the
referee
providing
the
type
of
hearing
which
was
required
by
the
district
court
order
determined
that
she
was
not
eligible
for
benefits.
in
this
case,
the
first
determination
by
the
deputy
was
that
mrs.
burney
was
not
eligible
for
benefits
in
that
she
was
unduly
restricting
the
hours
in
which
she
was
available
for
work.
the
referee
after
a
full
hearing
upheld
that
determination.
the
review
board
after
going
over
the
case,
hearing
argument
determined
that
the
restriction
upon
her
hours
of
possible
work
was
not
so
severe
as
to
indicate
that
she
was
not
available
for
work
within
the
statutory
meaning.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
at
that
time
her
case
was
completed.
there
was
no
appeal
to
the
indiana
court
of
appeals
on
this.
so,
mrs.
burney's
case
was
moot
at
this
point
in
the
same
way
that
the
java
case,
also
an
unemployment
compensation
case,
was
moot
well
before
it
ever
came
before
the
courts
for
final
decision.
this
was
a
class
action,
although
her
particular
claim
was
not
designated
as
such.
the
district
court
clearly
stated
that
it
was
ruling
on
behalf
of
mrs.
burney
and
of
a
subclass
within
the
original
case.
in
the
original
case,
there
were
actually
two
questions.
one
being
precisely
identical
to
the
java
issue
and
the
other
mrs.
burney's
case.
so
the
district
court
divided
this
into
two
subclasses
while
mrs.
burney's
particular
case
was
moot
at
a
very
early
stage
this
is
a
class
action
within
the
scope
of
the
district
court
opinion.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes
she
was.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
correct.
she
intervened
in
the
complaint
which
was
filed
by
mr.
hayatt.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
she
was
an
individual
intervener
within
the
scope
of
her
case.
however,
the
district
court
in
its
order
spoke
of
its
ruling
as
going
to
a
subclass
within
the
initial
order.
so
we
are
really
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
no,
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
can
not
give
you
the
exact
language,
but
it
was
all
persons
who
had
initially
been
determined
eligible
for
benefits
and
then
at
a
later
time
had
been
administratively
determined
no
longer
to
be
eligible.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
in
fact
her
benefit
eligibility
period
ran
out
some
time
ago,
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
there
it
was
none.
in
considering
the
question
of
determination
of
the
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
cannot
say
definitely.
we
thought
it
would
be
better
to
see
if
we
get
determination
because
this
was
fair
representation
and
the
fact
that
the
district
court
order
did
not
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
individual
case.
district
court
order
was
very
general.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
this
would
not
be
an
advisory
opinion
your
honor
because
it
is
an
injunction
which
is
against
the
division.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
at
first
point
the
controversy
would
be
between
the
division
and
all
persons
within
the
subclass
as
designated
by
the
district
court.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
of
that
of
any
such
case.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
cannot
give
a
firm
answer.
this
is
an
in
forma
pauperis
appeal
of
course.
so
the
question
of
cost
may
be
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
originally
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
such
party
in
this
case.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
if
the
injunction
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes,
as
far
as
the
indiana
procedure
is
concerned
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
one
way
or
the
other
because
there
are
other
cases
which
would
have
to
be
decided
but
presenting
exactly
the
same
issue.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
governing
future
cases
and
the
cases
by
which
we
are
now
operating.
if
this
were
dismissed
and
the
district
court
judgment
were
held
of
no
effect.
then
the
initial
effect
would
be
exactly
the
same
unless
of
course
a
new
action
were
brought.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes,
your
honor,
since
that
time
when
a
deputy
has
made
a
determination
of
ineligibility,
if
the
claimant
files
a
notice
of
appeal
benefits
are
still
paid
until
the
referee
hears
it
and
enters
a
decision
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
within
the
terms
--
at
the
present
time
if
this
were
vacated
it
would
go
and
go
back
our
assume
to
the
prior
practices,
this
would
be
a
decision
made
by
the
division
and
not
by
our
office
and
then
the
class
would
come
back
into
and
the
injunction
was
no
longer
in
effect.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
true
because
we
would
like
to
follow
district
court
injunctions.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
would
assume
so
because
i
would
assume
the
decision
is
not
my
to
make,
but
as
soon
as
division
would
then
go
back
to
something
like
its
prior
practices.
if
i
may
then,
deal
briefly
with
the
types
of
determinations
which
are
involved
here.
in
determining
a
claim
for
benefits,
there
are
basically
three
determinations
to
be
made,
breaking
this
down
into
three
as
far
as
appropriate
analysis,
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
are
only
two.
the
first
of
these
is
the
determination
of
insured
status.
this
is
merely
whether
the
claimant
has
had
enough
work
and
has
earned
wage
credits
in
a
covered
employment
to
be
eligible
for
benefits
if
he
meets
the
eligibility
requirements.
this
determination
says
nothing
about
whether
the
person
is
eligible
or
not
eligible.
in
fact,
a
person
can
even
request
this
determination
when
he
is
still
employed.
the
second
determination
goes
to
eligibility
and
this,
i
have
broken
down
into
two
parts.
the
first
issue,
going
to
the
reason
for
termination
of
the
prior
employment,
that
is
basically
whether
the
termination
was
attributable
to
the
employer
or
to
the
employee.
the
third
issue,
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
continuing
question
of
the
conduct
of
the
claimant
during
the
period
of
the
unemployment.
each
week,
the
claimant
is
required
to
well,
continue
to
be
unemployed,
to
be
able
to
work,
to
be
available
for
work,
to
be
making
an
independent
effort
to
secure
work,
to
not
have
refused
an
offer
of
a
suitable
job
or
not
have
refused
instructions
by
division
to
apply
for
a
job
which
would
be
suitable.
this
determination
is
made
each
week
by
the
division
and
it
is
on
this
basis
that
the
determination
of
eligibility
for
that
week
is
made.
there
is
never
any
determination
by
the
division
which
would
have
any
effect
for
any
week
prior
--
past
the
time
of
that
week.
this
is
like,
in
a
sense,
pay
for
looking
for
work
and
you
don't
get
paid
until
after
you
have
done
the
job.
when
a
person
comes
in
each
week
to
present
his
claim,
he
is
required
to
establish
that
he
has
met
these
criteria.
this
establishment
may
come
about
by
his
certification,
upon
the
voucher
form
that
he
has
met
these
requirements.
it
may
come
by
an
interview
or
a
hearing,
an
interview
type
hearing
with
a
claims
deputy.
this
hearing
would
be
basically
similar
to
the
hearing
on
an
initial
claim
which
was
described
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
the
case
of
california
department
of
human
resources
development
versus
java.
the
party,
the
claimant
is
called
in,
the
question
which
raises
the
doubt
is
discussed.
if
there
is
anyone
else
who
would
have
information,
the
deputy
finds
that
information
and
he
reaches
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
person
was
eligible
for
that
particular
week.
that
decision
is
as
much
an
initial
decision
in
that
sense
as
is
the
first
week.
the
only
difference
being
that
in
the
normal
situation,
it
is
not
necessary
each
week
to
determine
the
questions
of
why
the
previous
employment
was
terminated.
in
this
case,
mrs.
burney
was
determined
by
the
division,
by
the
deputy
not
to
be
available
for
work
in
that
she
was
unduly
restricting
the
hours
for
which
she
was
available
for
work
and
the
other
case
was
presenting
the
same
issue,
in
the
new
york
case
of
torres,
there
was
the
plaintiff
mr.
dinger
who
was
found
by
the
division
not
to
be
making
an
effort
to
secure
work.
in
the
vermont
case
of
wheeler
versus
vermont,
there
was
a
determination
there
that
the
claimant
had
refused
to
seek
work
when
directed
by
the
division.
in
the
california
case,
mrs.
crow
was
determined
to
have
refused
an
offer
of
suitable
work.
when
these
questions
arose,
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
determination
of
the
prior
week's
conduct
because
each
of
these
questions
is
a
condition
precedent
to
eligibility
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
this
is
a
different
type
of
system
than
the
welfare
system,
in
which
there
is
an
initial
determination
of
status
such
as
a
family
has
a
child
or
children
who
are
dependent
within
the
definition
of
42
u.s.c
section
606,
that
is,
a
needy
child
living
with
a
designated
relative
who
is
deprived
of
the
parental
support
of
at
least
one
parent.
in
those
cases,
once
a
determination
is
made,
it
continues
in
effect
and
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
hearing
because
a
prior
determination
having
continuing
effect
is
now
being
changed.
the
welfare
recipient
has
no
such
affirmative
duties
to
go
out
and
look
for
work,
to
be
available
for
work
and
not
to
review
his
work.
so,
we
have
a
completely
different
situation
here.
the
welfare
situation
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
at
all.
in
looking
to
this
court's
decision
in
java
last
year
which
was
held
by
the
district
court
to
be
dispositive
of
the
issue,
i
believe
that
the
rule
of
law
of
the
java
court
actually
supports
the
position
of
the
division
in
this
case.
in
java,
you
had
an
initial
determination
by
the
deputy
in
the
california
department,
as
to
the
eligibility
of
a
particular
claimant.
after
that
determination
had
been
made,
one
of
the
parties
to
that
case
filed
a
notice
appeal
and
that
notice
or
appeal
was
sufficient
in
itself
to
call
for
determination
of
benefits,
even
though
in
that
case,
the
division
had
determined
that
the
benefits
were
due.
so,
you
were
allowing
a
party
to
upset
the
decision
of
the
impartial
agency.
in
this
case,
we
merely
have
the
other
party
seeking
to
overturn
the
decision
of
the
impartial
agency
that
benefits
are
not
due,
this
is
merely
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
i
would
emphasize
in
this
respect
that
the
indiana
employment
security
division
is
an
impartial
arbiter
in
these
cases.
the
state
of
indiana
and
the
division
have
no
interest
in
whether
or
not
these
payments
are
made,
in
the
sense
that
the
money
used
to
pay
these
benefits
comes
from
employers
and
not
from
the
state
treasury.
the
administrative
expenses
so
long
as
the
plan
is
held
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
federal
law
are
paid
by
the
federal
government.
the
interest
of
the
state
agency
is
merely
in
having
a
workable
system
in
which
the
authority
of
the
impartial
arbiter
is
upheld
and
the
duties
placed
upon
claimants
by
the
social
security
act
and
the
state
unemployment
compensation
laws
are
met.
when
congress
passed
the
provision
to
the
social
security
law
dealing
with
the
questions
of
unemployment
compensation,
they
had
before
it
a
general
outline
of
what
unemployment
compensation
plan
would
be
like
and
this
included
these
issues.
the
district
of
columbia
unemployment
compensation
code
which
was
then
passed
by
congress,
includes
the
same
provisions.
so
as
a
result
we
have
the
determination
by
the
agency
that
a
party
is
not
eligible
for
benefits.
we
have
a
claimant
for
whatever
reason,
in
most
cases
probably
because
of
a
sincere
questions
as
to
the
fact
but
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
java
case
possibly
by
an
arbitrary
desire
or
merely
by
a
desire
to
apply
short
run
benefit
may
file
a
frivolous
appeal.
there
is
no
way
to
determine
this
until
the
referee
decision
has
been
made
and
in
some
cases
on
from
there
to
the
review
board
and
from
there
to
the
indiana
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
of
due
process
has
been
presented
in
this
case.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
this
issue
in
this
case
except
to
in
the
following
way.
the
district
court
did
not
rule
on
the
due
process
issue
presented
under
goldberg
versus
kelly.
it
did,
however,
require
the
division
to
provide
a
prior
due
process
hearing
and
did
not
explain
what
that
hearing
should
consist
of.
division
filed
a
motion
for
amendment
of
judgment
to
show
what
that
hearing
would
consist
of
and
the
district
court
refused
that
motion
being
unable
or
unwilling
to
say
what
a
due
process
hearing
is.
i
believe
it's
clear
from
the
law
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
due
process
hearing
in
the
sense
of
a
specific
set
of
requirements.
due
process
is
a
much
more
general
phrase
which
would
vary
from
period
to
period
and
from
case
to
case.
what
is
due
process
in
one
situation
would
not
be
due
process
in
another.
and
what
maybe
a
denial
of
due
process
in
one
situation
would
provide
due
process
in
another
situation.
therefore,
it's
necessary
to
look
at
this
question
within
the
realm
of
the
unemployment
compensation
and
not
in
the
question
of
welfare
even
though
both
of
these
are
programs
under
the
social
security
act
and
determine
whether
the
deputy
determination
would
be
a
proper
determination
in
this
case.
whether
the
deputy
determination
is
itself
a
due
process
hearing
within
the
scope
of
the
district
court
order.
since
the
district
court
refused
or
wasn't
able
to
clarify
that
order,
the
division
felt
it
was
necessary
to
give
it
the
strictest
possible
interpretation
because
they
didn't
know
what
might
put
them
in
contempt
of
court.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
since
the
injunction
was
presented,
there
is
the
deputy
determination
which
is
basically
the
same
question
--
the
same
procedure
as
was
presented
in
the
java
case,
that
is
the
deputy
interviews
the
claimant,
interviews
other
persons
having
information
about
it.
now
in
the
above
both
the
cases
for
example
frequently
there
will
be
no
employer
party
because
the
prior
employer
would
have
no
way
of
having
knowledge
as
to
the
behavior
of
the
claimant
after
this
period.
after
all
of
this
information
is
presented
and
in
most
of
these
cases
the
information
comes
exclusively
from
the
claimant
himself,
the
deputy
determines
the
facts
and
determines
whether
that
brings
a
person
within
one
of
the
limitations,
whether
in
that
situation
the
person
is
eligible.
however,
since
the
district
court
injunction
was
entered,
the
deputy
determination
did
made
in
the
same
way.
however
the
deputy
determination
of
ineligibility
is
not
given
effect
if
the
claimant
expresses
a
desire
to
appeal
to
a
referee,
but
rather
benefits
are
paid
despite
the
fact
that
there
has
never
been
a
determination
of
eligibility
for
that
period
until
a
referee
hearing
and
the
written
formal
referee
opinion
is
handed
down.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
before
the
injunction
when
the
deputy
made
determination,
that's
if
the
deputy
determined
that
then
--
the
claimant
was
not
eligible
for
benefits,
benefits
are
not
paid
for
that
week.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
they
would
be
retroactive.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
believe
that
it
would
go
back
to
that
procedure.
this
is
--
that
rule
made
by
the
division
court
is
not
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
well,
that
is
basically
the
question.
however,
i
would
have
to
take
issue
with
the
statement
you
used
in
that
there
is
no
termination
of
benefits.
this
is
a
one
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
most
clearly.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
simply
–
except
there
has
never
done
any
determination
that
the
claimant
was
eligible
for
any
period
other
than
past
weeks
and
the
question
of
what
happened
in
past
weeks
does
not
control
what
happens
in
the
week
in
question?
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes.
he
must
come
in
and
certify
has
met
these
requirements.
he
must
fall
of
the
certification
or
if
it's
a
time
when
there
is
interview,
at
that
time
they
will
discuss
what
he
has
been
doing
during
the
time,
what
efforts
he
has
made
to
secure
work,
what
he
is
been
doing.
at
that
time
also
they
might
suggest
other
ways
of
finding
work,
perhaps
looking
in
a
slightly
different
field,
checking
to
see
if
there
is
some
other
type
of
skill
which
the
employee
--
which
the
claimant
has,
which
would
enable
him
to
find
work
in
a
slightly
different
field.
this
is
not
merely
an
attempt
by
the
division
to
do
a
person
out
of
benefits.
it's
an
attempt
to
find
out
whether
the
person
meets
the
criteria
and
try
to
find
a
way
to
find
him
a
job.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
as
i
understand
it,
i
believe
it
is
unlawful
for
the
employer
to
attempt
to
deduct
any
of
this
contribution
from
the
employee's
wages.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
it
is
not
a
contributory
fund.
this
is
simply
a
payment
by
the
employer
himself.
no
claimant
money
involved,
no
state
money
involved.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes
there
is.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
believe
it
is
10
days
in
the
normal
case.
in
certain
cases
where
you
have
an
interstate
claimant
and
the
like,
it
maybe
15
days,
but
ordinarily
the
appeal
must
be
presented
within
that
period
of
time
and
under
indiana
law
that
time
limit
is
jurisdictional
for
consideration
by
the
next
highest
club.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
this
varies
according
to
the
staffing
of
the
department
and
according
to
the
case
load
at
the
time.
at
the
time
that
mrs.
burney's
case
arose,
it
was
a
long
period
of
time,
perhaps
10-15
weeks.
at
the
present
time,
most
--
about
half
of
the
cases
or
more
--
are
being
decided
by
the
referee
within
30
days.
this
is
because
primarily
of
an
increase
in
the
staffing
and
partly
because
this
is
a
little
bit
soccer
time
for
claims,
not
has
been
any
claims
are
being
presented.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
before
the
deputy
--
there
were
two
questions
unless
i
fail
to
understand
all
the
--
both
of
them?
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
the
injunction
of
the
district
court
did
not
affect
the
referee
hearing.
this
is
an
administrative
hearing
of
counsel.
the
parties
are
given
notice.
they
are
told
that
they
may
bring
witnesses.
they
may
bring
counsel
or
any
other
person
to
assist
them
in
presenting
their
case.
if
a
party
is
not
represented
the
referee
is
given
the
duty
of
helping
them
present
their
case
of
bringing
out
all
the
facts
which
might
be
relevant
to
it.
it
is
like
a
court
hearing
in
a
sense,
except
that
the
referee
has
greater
duties
to
make
sure
that
the
facts
are
presented
then
would
an
impartial
judge
who
merely
sits
back
and
decides
what
the
case
is
like.
it
might
be
like
a
smoke
flame
cordon
in
many
areas.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
but
that
that
the
referee
hearing
would
provide
the
due
process
elements
under
goldberg.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
this
was
true
both
before
and
after.
the
practices
of
the
division
had
not
been
changed
by
the
injunction
except
to
the
extent
that
the
determination
by
the
deputy
of
non
eligibility
is
no
longer
given
effect.
that
is
the
only
difference
in
the
procedure
at
this
time.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
the
benefit
year
can
be
up
to
52
weeks,
if
there
is
a
situation
--
a
substantial
unemployment
then
under
a
federal
program.
there
can
be
an
extended
benefit
period
beyond
this.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
do
not
have
those
figures
for
indiana.
i
don't
believe
those
figures
have
been
calculated.
indiana
is
also
in
this
regard
a
small
state.
we
have
only
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
believe
the
information
i
received
from
their
office
when
last
talking
to
them
was
that
the
an
affidavit
in
the
record
in
the
co-case
in
california
indicated
that
the
total
cost
be
something
like
the
167
million
dollars
there.
this
was
in
extra
employer
contributions
and
extra
administrative
expenses.
if
the
benefits
are
found
to
be
paid
erroneously
and
is
necessary
to
try
to
bring
them
back
by
either
collecting
the
money
or
not
paying
for
future
weeks'
of
eligibility.
this
requires
extra
administrative
help.
for
example,
the
indiana
polis
local
claims
office;
before
the
injunction
had
one
worker
spending
about
half
of
his
time
on
recouping
erroneous
payments.
now
this
one
office
has
two
employees
full
time
on
this
case
and
this
is
only
the
one
local
office.
so
there
is
an
extra
administrative
load
which
the
expense
of
this
is
probably
on
the
united
states
government
and
not
upon
the
state
government,
but
it
is
an
extra
administrative
expense
and
extra
administrative
burdens.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
that
is
correct.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
--
i
don't
know
that
the
figures
are
available
for
this
latest
period.
previously
they
were
receiving
kind
of
big
payment
i
think
about
60%-70%,
i
am
not
sure
of
the
exact
figure
but
as
i
remember
it's
in
that
area.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes,
your
honor.
when
they
claimants
comes
in
to
the
office.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes
he
comes
in
each
week
(voice
overlap)
for
benefits.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
only
in
exceptional
cases
where
the
agency
will
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes
the
voucher
form
which
he
fills
out
is
a
blank
ibm
card
which
would
be
punched
later
and
includes
the
statement,
“i
hereby
certify
that
i
fulfill
the
registration
for
work
requirements,
that
during
the
compensable
week
covered
by
this
voucher
i
was
unemployed,
physically
fit
available
for
and
actively
seeking
work
except
as
noted
herein.”
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
yes,
periodically.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
if
the
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
there
was
an
interview
and
it
was
at
the
interview
that
the
information
came
out.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
well
if
the
person
refuses
to
sign
a
certification
and
there
can
be
no
payment
because
this
voucher
must
be
signed
and
sent
in
and
is
from
this
voucher
that
payment
is
made.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
if
there
is
a
question
which
arises
the
claims
taker
will
then
refer
that
to
a
deputy
for
the
full
interview
hearing
type.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
i
am
sure
it
will
be
unusual,
but
i
was
told
that
everything
happens
and
it
does
happen
except
it
will
be
unusual
--
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
if
there
is
a
question
ordinarily
any
time
the
claims
taker
presents,
sees
any
issue
this
is
to
be
referred
to
a
deputy
for
a
full
interview
to
find
out
what
the
situation
is.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
it
has
been
about
the
same.
mr.
darrel
k.
diamond
no
significant
change,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
in
relation
to
these
statistics
that
i
think
i
covered
this
in
reply
brief,
but
i
don't
think
these
are
really
relevant
to
the
case
and
in
any
event
these
are
surely
a
somewhat
comparable
reversal
at
the
review
board
of
the
referee
and
in
addition
i
would
point
out
to
the
java
decision
when
this
court
spoke
with
an
air
of
approval
it
seems
to
me
of
the
java
procedure,
it
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
in
that
case,
footnote
7
of
the
number
of
reversals
from
the
deputy
to
the
referee
and
it
was
just
looking
at
the
referee
somewhere
in
the
30%
area.
so
this
apparently,
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
it
was
covered
in
java,
but
this
was
before
record
in
java
and
the
court
still
spoke
of
it
your
honor.
