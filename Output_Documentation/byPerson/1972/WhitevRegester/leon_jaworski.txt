mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
was
true
in
the
case
argued
just
before,
that's
one
the
attorney
general
of
the
texas,
the
honorable
john
l.
hill
has
participated
in
the
preparation
of
this
appeal.
he
has
the
staff
with
us,
and
in
order
to
avoid
the
providing
of
arguments,
he
has
asked
that
i
present
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
state.
i
think
it
perhaps
a
more
accurate
description
of
what
this
case
really
involves
could
hardly
be
made
and
the
characterization
given
it
by
the
central
judge
who
stated
that
this
was
an
instance
of
the
majority
entering
fields
of
the
purely
state
and
local
management.
now
under
the
provisions
of
article
3,
section
28
of
the
constitution
of
texas,
a
legislative
redistricting
board
has
assembled,
if
the
legislature
fails
to
redistrict
the
state
after
its
first
regular
session
following
the
publication
of
each
united
states
decennial
census.
so
the
legislature
convened
in
january
1971,
was
under
constitutional
mandate,
to
provide
this
redistricting.
our
texas
has
a
bicameral
legislature,
and
because
the
legislature
had
failed
to
redistrict
in
both
houses,
of
course,
any
effort
at
redistricting
failed
and
as
a
consequence,
the
redistricting
board
was
assembled
and
considered
the
matter
of
providing
a
plan
of
redistricting
the
senate,
and
also
a
plan
of
redistricting
the
lower
house.
now,
this
board
consists
as
constituted
by
several
elected
officials,
state
officials
serving
on
it.
there
is
the
lieutenant
governor,
the
speaker
of
the
house,
the
attorney
general,
the
comptroller
of
public
accounts,
and
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office.
now
three
or
more
of
these
members
of
the
redistricting
board
may
assign
whatever
plan
they
agree
upon,
and
it
certify
to
the
secretary
of
state,
and
then
it
becomes
an
effective
plan.
now,
i
might
say
that
the
house
plan
is
the
only
one.
the
plan
relating
to
the
representative
is
the
only
plan
that's
involved
on
this
appeal.
perhaps,
brief
reference
should
be
made
to
the
commencement
of
those
litigation
after
they
planned
to
file,
a
suit
was
instituted
in
houston,
texas
by
curtis
graves,
a
black
state
representative
from
harris
county
that?s
huston
in
which
he
contended
that
there
was
unconstitutional
apportionment
of
the
senatorial
districts
because
of
an
alleged
racial
gerrymandering.
his
point
being
that
there
should
have
been
district
carved
out
in
which
80%
are
blacks
and
that
because
one
was
not
carved
out
in
that
matter
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
then
next
came,
a
number
of
others
civil
suits
that
were
filled
challenging
the
boards
plan
for
the
house
of
representatives
in
different
parts
of
the
state
with
different
groups,
filing
these
suits,
and
interventions
were
also
filled
on
behalf
of
a
number
of
groups
and
there
was
a
consolidation
of
all
of
these
actions
and
they
were
heard
before
the
three-judge
court.
now,
the
court
ordered
first
that
unless
the
legislature
of
texas
on
or
before
july
of
the
1,
1973,
adopted
a
plan
to
reapportion
the
legislative
districts
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
guideline
set
out
in
the
court's
opinion
that
the
court
will
then
proceed
to
reapportion
the
state
itself,
and
then
the
court
further
ordered
that
the
counties
of
dallas,
that
is
where
the
city
of
dallas
is
and
the
county
of
bexar
that's
where
san
antonio
is
that
both
of
these,
the
reapportioned
into
single-member
representative
districts
in
conformance
with
a
plan
of
reapportionment
that
the
court
provided.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes
sir,
an
injunctive
relief,
excuse
me
sir.
the
injunctive
relief
consisted
all
of
the
state
being
restrained
from
proceeding.
the
elections
could
not
be
held
in
accordance
with
the
plan
that
had
been
filed
by
the
redistricting
board.
a
judge
would
say,
state
it
very
frankly
that
he'll
wholeheartedly
disagree
with
his
colleagues
in
declaring
the
state
plan
unconstitutional,
saying
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
that
illustrated
more
vividly
the
chaos
that
existed
in
the
area
of
restructuring
the
political
districts
of
a
state
as
was
attempted
to
be
done
and
ordered
by
the
court
in
this
particular
instance.
it'd
be
done
by
july
1,
1973
or
else
of
course
the
plan
had
to
be
adopted.
of
course
the
mahan
versus
howell
case
is
very
significant.
a
number
of
the
courts'
pronouncements
in
that
case
are
quite
applicable
here.
perhaps
i
should
point
out
that
what
the
majority
did
in
our
case
was
relied
on
the
kirkpatrick
versus
preisler
case
and
repeatedly
refrying
to
it
also
on
wells
versus
rockefeller,
both
which
is
we
know
are
congressional
redistricting
cases.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
what
this
court
of
course
said
in
the
mahan
and
howell
case.
mr.
leon
jaworski
and
also
said
it,
yes
sir
in
the
reynolds
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
right
sir,
but
it
was
quite
well
emphasized
in
a
case
that
was
decided
or
relevant
in
[voice
overlap]
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
it
did
some
reemphasizing
and
perhaps
having
come
so
recently
or
something
that
we
might
talk
about
little
more,
but
let
me
just
pass
counsel,
but
certainly
there
was
nothing
new
in
it.
the
interesting
thing
is
that
judge
wood
who
so
strongly
dissented
in
this
case
from
the
actual
majority,
recognized
that
difference
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
and
he
recognized
the
difference
between
congressional
districts
and
legislative
districts,
pointing
to
the
cases,
pointing
to
reynolds
versus
sims.
now
what
the
majority
did
here
was
required,
first
a
much
stricter
standard
of
state
legislative
reapportionment,
permissible
deviation
and
had
been
approved
theretofore.
actually
in
this
case
the
total
variation
of
9.9%
under
the
board
was
on
question
thus
far
as
the
majority
opinion
was
concerned.
i
notice
wherein
in
one
of
the
briefs
some
question
was
raised
whether
that
might
be
entirely
accurate,
but
there
had
been
nothing
before
the
lower
court
raised
any
question
beyond
that
of
it
being
assumed
and
considered
that
the
total
variation
was
only
9.9%.
now,
this
was
under
the
board's
redistricting
plan.
i
should
point
out
that
actually
the
average
variation
was
only
1.82%.
now
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case,
a
matter
on
which
so
very
much
stress
was
laid
by
majority
the
court
which
in
our
view
led
the
court
exactly
to
nothing
as
far
as
the
end
result
was
concerned,
where
the
procedural
(inaudible)
is
simply
followed
by
this
board.
there
were
several
tings
that
took
place.
of
course
these
men,
all
of
them
had
to
depend
upon
staff
assistance
because
they
had
other
duties
to
perform
as
state
officials
and
they
did
have
considerable
staff
assistance.
perhaps
the
one
official
who
participated
more
than
any
one
else
in
this
particular
matter
was
the
attorney
general
himself
who
counseled
with
the
redistricting
board
constantly
on
what
should
be
done
and
also
letting
him
know
on
the
what
was
permissibly
legal
as
he
interpreted
the
decisions.
but
the
court
has
gone
to
considerable
extent
in
talking
about,
not
the
end
results
so
much
as
these
procedures
that
was
employed
in
finding
fault
with
them,
and
finding
fault
with
the
particular
assistance
that
had
been
rendered
by
members
of
the
staff
and
such
as
that
forgetting
it
seems
to
me
at
least
for
a
moment
that
even
judges
need
the
assistance
or
at
least
utilize
the
assistance
of
law
clerks
at
times.
but,
also
it
is
very
clear,
there
was
a
complete
misapprehension
of
whitcomb
versus
chavis
actually
said.
what
the
court
here
did
was
not
only
indicated,
went
into
the
matter
of
redistricting
the
entire
state
also
found
fault
with
what
had
been
specifically
insofar
as
single
and
multi-member
districts
were
concerned
and
the
two
counties
that
i
mentioned.
what
the
court
failed
to
do
as
we
see
it
was
to
employ
the
equal
protection
test
and
that
a
state
must
make
an
honest
and
a
good-faith
effort
to
construct
the
districts
as
nearly
of
equal
population
as
is
practicable
and
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
in
this
record
that
this
good-faith
effort
was
not
made.
and
let
me
regress
for
a
moment
if
i
may,
because
i
have
noted
that
there
were
some
references
made
in
some
of
the
briefs
to
some
alleged
evidence
in
this
case
that
frankly
is
no
evidence.
what
happened
at
the
outset
was
that
the
chief
judge
of
this
three-judge
court,
the
presiding
judge
and
announced
that
everything
that
was
offered
by
anyone
would
be
admitted
in
evidence.
he
didn't
want
us
to
even
make
any
objections.
if
the
matter
was
conjectural,
if
it
was
hearsay
or
whatever
the
proper
objection
may
have
been
it
went
into
the
record
anyway
and
the
announcement
being
that
the
court
would
at
the
end
consider
those
things
that
were
admissible
on
those
matters
that
were
not
admissible,
but
there
were
no
rulings
ever
made
by
the
court
and
as
a
consequence
the
floodgates
were
opened
and
everybody
led
into
thinking
that
you
want
to
bring
before
the
court
just
introduced
it
into
evidence
and
then
proceed.
we
don't
know
actually
what
the
court
did
consider
and
what
it
didn't
consider
speaking
of
the
majority.
but,
we
do
know
that
there
were
some
matters
tendered
here
that
were
not
admissible
in
evidence
and
that
the
record
presently
is
cluttered
with
some
of
those
matters.
i
mention
that
simply
because
what
should
really
be
a
relatively
a
easy
case
to
discuss
with
the
court
and
the
issues
being
well
defined
as
we
see
it,
is
complicated
a
little
because
of
some
of
the
references
that
have
been
made
in
some
of
the
briefs
to
what
the
evidence
purportedly
showed.
now,
the
court,
the
majority,
apparently
everywhere
just
placed
the
burden
upon
the
state.
it
may,
you
know
to
show
that
there
was
no
inequality
of
any
kind,
that
there
was
no
discrimination
of
any
kind,
that
there
wasn't
any
type
of
dilution
and
had
us
carry
the
burden
throughout
the
case.
so,
far
as
i
tell
we
discharged
the
burden
although
it
is
questionable
as
to
whether
we
had
the
burden
in
all
of
these
instances.
now
texas
is
a
large
state
as
is
known,
we
will
not
engage
in
talking
about
how
large
it
is,
but
it's
not
only
a
large
one,
but
it
is
also
has
a
shape
and
it
does
not
render
it
very
easily
susceptible
to
a
division
among
districts.
so,
some
problem
is
going
to
be
encountered,
but
we
actually
--
what
was
necessary
here
were
--
well,
let
me
say
first
the
ideal
district
was
about
74,000,
seventy
four
thousand
plus.
there
were
a
150
representatives
to
be
elected
to
the
lower
house
and
a
large
number
of
districts
had
to
be
carved
out
in
addition
to
it.
this
particular
board
was
confronted
with
a
decision
--
first
with
the
provision
of
the
constitution
of
our
state
which
had
been
interpreted
in
the
case
of
craddick
versus
smith
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
under
that
county
lines
could
not
be
crossed,
unless
it
were
absolutely
necessary
to
do
it
in
order
to
make
up
this
district
of
74,000,
the
ideal.
it
also
required
that
it
go
to
a
contagious
county
if
it
were
necessary
to
do
that.
now,
texas
as
we
know
and
as
the
court
doubtless
knows,
not
only
has
this
large
metropolitan
cities,
but
it
has
rural
areas
that
has
large
areas
that
are
very
sparsely
settled.
now
actually
there
was
no
instance
in
which
our
constitutional
requirements
and
the
integrity
that
was
required
for
this
board
to
follow
was
not
carefully
embraced
in
each
instance
with
the
possible
exception,
well
would
be
exception
of
red
river
county
and
there
we
had
a
real
problem
up
in
the
part
that
adjoins
arkansas
with
the
red
river
and
between
the
two
of
them
had
a
problem
as
to
buren
county.
so,
what
was
actually
done
is
that
in
that
one
instance
the
county
line,
it
was
crossed.
now,
the
total
population
incidentally
as
the
court
probably
has
already
gathered
from
what
i
had
said
is
according
to
the
last
census
about
eleven
million
two
hundred
thousand.
the
senatorial
district
is
not
involved
here,
but
maybe
of
interest
of
the
court
is
of
approximately
360,000
to
368,000.
now,
if
we
were
to
draw
comparisons
here
and
i
do
this
only
because
a
case
has
just
been
decided
by
this
court
and
to
show
a
similarity
of
the
situations
if
i
may
reveal
those
in
the
virginia,
there
was
a
total
variation
of
16.4
under
what
the
board
that
here,
the
total
variation
of
9.9
and
average
variation
in
the
mahan
case
of
3.89
in
texas
of
1.82.
within
the
4%
there
were
35
of
the
districts
in
virginia.
in
texas
we
had
93
under
this
board's
plan.
those
that
exceeded
6%
were
9
in
virginia,
there
were
none
under
this
board's
plan
in
texas
and
only
two
exceeded
the
5%.
i
indicated
a
few
moments
ago
that
it
was
our
view
that
what
whitcomb
v.
chavis
had
been
misinterpreted
and
we
do
feel
that
that
is
definitely
in
the
case.
i
want
to
mention
one
effort
that
was
made
in
particular,
that
was
injunction
in
the
case
the
fact
that
perhaps
one
difference
was
that
in
indiana
particular
the
marion
county
which
was
involved
in
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis
case
that
there
was
no
racial
history
and
a
suggestion
was
made
the
texas
had
a
racial
history.
here
is
no
one
that
would
deny
that
texas
has
true
what
so
many
of
the
states
has
a
racial
legacy.
it
is
untrue
that
there
is
any
showing
whatever
that
there
has
been
any
such
happenings,
any
sort
of
racial
violation
with
respect
to
the
electoral
process
in
our
state.
the
last
one
according
to
testimony
in
this
case
undisputed
is
coming
from
a
witness
who
appeared
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
was
back
in
1956.
so
that
this
is
really
not
in
the
case
despite
the
fact
the
witness
was
put
on
the
stand
to
testify
that
or
undertake
to
testify
and
this
is
one
of
the
particular
matters
to
which
i
refer
that
has
made
it
somewhat
difficult
to
briefly
argue
this
case
because
the
court
admitted
everything.
man
who
opposed
does
an
expert
and
undertook
to
say
that
there
was
a
difference
as
far
as
racial
history
in
indianapolis
and
marion
county
was
concerned
and
in
texas.
and
then
it
turned
out
when
i
asked
them
the
question
on
cross
examination
that
he
had
never
even
been
to
indiana
much
less
indianapolis
had
not
made
any
type
of
study
of
the
matter
and
as
i
said
in
our
brief
to
show
what
we
had
to
contend
with.
i
should
say
that
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record
in
order
to
lay
at
rest
completely
the
matter
of
all
having
been
free
to
engage
in
our
process
of
registration
as
well
as
holding,
there
is
a
stipulation
that
there
has
been
and
none
of
that
in
our
state
for
a
number
of
years
and
of
course
the
evidence
shows
nothing
of
the
kind.
now,
we
get
into
another
phase
that
i
want
to
discuss
with
the
court
if
i
may
and
that
has
what
happened
with
respect
to
harris
county,
houston
under
the
boards
plan
being
divided
into
single
member
districts
and
what
happened
and
so
far
as
dallas
--
it
is
dallas
county
and
san
antonio
bear
county
being
multimember
districts.
now
there
of
course
is
some
difference
one
could
say
huston
a
very
large
city,
a
million
seven
hundred
thousand
either
fifth
or
sixth
largest
city
of
the
nation
at
the
present
time.
dallas,
a
million
three,
dallas
county.
san
antonio,
even
a
much
smaller
city
than
that,
traditionally
dallas
had
multi
member
districts
same
was
true
of
bexar
county.
and
as
far
as
huston
is
concerned
harris
county
the
legislators
themselves,
the
delegation
from
their
more
or
less
favored
single
member
districts.
so
on
the
surface
you
might
say
why
does
the
harris
county
have
single
member
districts
and
why
does
dallas
and
bexar
county
have
multiple
member
districts?
really
it
was
done
without
to
being
the
slightest
intimation
on
the
record
that
in
the
individual
group
sacrificed
any
constitutional
rights
by
virtue
of
it,
it
was
done
largely
because
the
board
had
before
it
witnesses
who
thought
that
this
was
a
sensible
thing
to
do
in
harris
county
had
witnesses
before
that
thought
it
was
a
sensible
thing
to
do
in
dallas
and
bexar
county
what
was
done
in
those.
now
our
position
is
they
tops
in,
the
showing
of
something
that
shows
that
either
voting
strength
is
being
diluted
or
that
something
has
been
done
that
has
occasioned
the
transpiration
of
a
constitutional
right
that
certainly
much
has
been
made
of
nothing.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no
sir
this
is
--
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that
sir,
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that
that
was
true
as
far
as
dallas
was
concerned
and
i
believe
bexar
county
because
they
have
--
but
it
was
not
true
as
far
as
harris
county
is
concern.
harris
county
had
some
election
in
past
they
have
floatorial
representative
or
even.
i
said
what
really
brought
it
on
more
than
anything
else
is
a
delegation
should
come
from
these
particular
areas
and
the
board
in
shifting
what
people
wanted
but
their
representative
said
they
want,
made
these
provisions
of
single
member
districts
for
huston,
for
harris
county
multimember
for
dallas
and
for
bexar
county.
mr.
leon
jaworski
dallas
and
bexar
historically
have
had
multi
member.
mr.
leon
jaworski
has
had
but
also
some
mixture
mr.
justice
stewart
there
have
been
mixtures
of
floatorial
representative
and
such
as
that
are
whole
voters.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
may
have
been
in
the
history
of
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
do
not
think
that
this
was
a
part
of
what
was
before
the
board,
i
do
want
to
make
mention
of
this.
now
you
take
bexar
county
for
example,
this
is
as
county
of
san
antonio
where
a
large
segment
of
the
population
is
mexican
american,
actually
50%
of
them
are.
you
don't
have
a
minority
there
of
mexican
americans
toll,
the
record
shows
that
if
they
undertook
to
exercise
the
election
process
they
are
right
to
vote,
they
are
register
in
vote,
there
would
not
be
any
problem.
the
problem
is
been
that
less
than
30%
of
more
approximately
30%
of
them
seek
to
exercise
that
privilege.
this
is
where
your
trouble
has
been
as
far
as
bexar
county
is
concerned.
i
should
make
mention
of
this
too
because
it?s
in
the
record,
no
matter
that
probably
will
be
talked
about.
dallas
county
has
a
strong
political
party;
it?s
a
party
that
has
had
on
it
slate,
blacks
as
well
as
whites.
here
the
record
shows
that
they
were
contemplating
three
blacks
on
their
slate
following
this
active
redistricting,
actually
that
they
have
had
at
different
levels
are
just
even
include
in
the
legislative
level
black
on
the
slate
before,
that
is
true
that
it
is
as
strong
political
organization
it
is
true
that
a
black
placed
on
that
slate
probably
would
be
elected
is
also
true
when
a
white
placed
on
that
slate
would
be
elected.
it
is
also
true
that
if
this
organization
opposed
a
white
that
he
would
hard
time
been
elected,
just
as
much
as
if
the
organization
opposed
a
black.
the
while
routed
in
history
as
i
answered
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
the
matter
of
multimember
districts
has
never
been
used
in
dallas
and
direct
this
completely
silent,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
multimember
district
arrangement
for
dallas
county
was
used
or
conceived
either
to
dilute
or
cancel
the
voting
strength
of
blacks
and
i
think
that
this
distinguishes
it
from
some
other
and
inferences
and
pronouncements
that
had
been
made
by
this
court
in
other
cases
and
i
believe
with
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
court.
i
will
wait
with
the
concluding
argument
until
after
counsel
for
the
(inaudible).
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
jurisdictional
question
i
think
it
perhaps
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
by
a
members
of
the
court
who
have
brought
out
the
basis
on
which
we
argued
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
and
i
would
merely
say
to
the
court
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
cases
that
are
applicable,
we
also
have
undertaken
to
show
to
the
court
that
the
cases
on
which
the
appellees
rely
are
not
applicable.
actually,
what
has
been
done
here
has
a
state
wide
impact.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no
sir,
no
sir.
what
happened
was
that
a
part
of
the
appeal,
you
may
recall,
this
court
entered
a
judgment,
the
appeal
that
came
from
harris
county
and
they
remembered
that
the
court
entered
a
judgment
dismissing
that
part,
not
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
but
for
other
reasons.
in
any
event,
this
has
been
fully
briefed,
i
don?t
think
that
i
need
to
take
the
time
of
the
court.
actually,
i
did
not
see
because
the
rule
first
that
this
actually
had
a
state
wide
impact
but
secondly,
also
the
pendant
jurisdiction
rule;
i
had
not
taken
the
time
to
really
argue
that
for
the
court
and
the
original
argument.
now,
passing
on
to
something
else
and
mr.
justice
stewart
did
ask
me
about
the
history
with
respect
to
harris
county
and
it
was
that
history
with
respect
to
houston,
harris
county
that
i
undertook
to
say
i
was
not
fully
familiar
with.
the
history
as
to
dallas
county
has
been
one
consistently
of
multimember
districts
but
as
far
harris
county
is
concerned,
i
answer
that
they
were
floterial
districts
in
1965;
there
were
three
multimember
districts
in
1966,
five
multimember
districts
in
1971.
now,
this
is
the
history
as
the
record
shows
it
to
be.
i
merely
pointed
out
because
harris
county
did
have
some
history
of
some
multimember
districts.
but
it
also
has
a
history
that
really
shows
more
that
there
has
been
a
division
and
when
we
speak
of
polls,
for
instance,
in
dallas
county
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
polls,
i
think
we
get
into
some
difficulty
because
the
polls
as
we
know,
if
they
are
going
to
be
polls
relate
to
how
well
a
candidate
is
running,
they
may
have
some
inaccuracy
but
i
wasn?t
referring
to
polls,
i
was
referring
to
what
had
actually
been
requested
to
all
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
and
the
record
shows
this.
the
legislators
had
been
known
the
wishes
with
respect
to
what
they
wanted
in
harris
county
and
also
what
the
situation
was
as
desired
in
the
other
counties.
now,
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
policy,
actually
i
don?t
know
where
the
idea
got
into
the
record
that
there
had
been
any
state
policy
with
respect
to
the
matter,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
was
raised
a
question
you
referred
to
where
15
district
matters
arose.
what
actually
happened
was
that
the
limitation
was
never
offered
in
a
state
policy
at
one
time,
the
house
committee
on
congressional
and
legislative
districts
had
felt
that
multimember
district
should
be
somewhat
limited
in
size
because
of
the
voting
machine
problem.
now
these
changes
in
the
voting
machines
and
the
difficulty
of
getting
them
and
the
difficulty
of
their
cost
and
placing
so
many
of
them
did
raise
a
question
but
this
was
largely
done
to
accommodate
a
new
change
that
had
been
made
in
the
voting
machines.
the
limitation
was
never
offered
as
a
state
policy
as
this
record
will
show
and
there
is
no
indication
as
i
read
the
kilgarlin
case
that
the
court
assured
or
was
assured
that
the
limitation
would
be
continued
in
future
apportionment
plans.
this
is
just
simply
something
that
we
find
unable
to
follow
completely.
then
when
we
speak
of
single-member
and
multimember
districts
or
single-member
districts
throughout
the
state,
there?s
an
interesting
texas
supreme
court
case
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it?s
the
mauzy
case
as
we
also
referred
to
it
and
they
are
in
the
texas
supreme
court
refuge
to
grant
the
relator?s
request
that
the
board
be
ordered
to
use
single-member
districts
throughout
the
state.
and
you?ll
also
find
in
the
smith
versus
craddick
case
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
found,
and
this
is
the
texas
supreme
court
talking
about
multimember
districts
itself
as
they
found
that
in
any
part
of
the
state,
there
was
an
unfairness
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
multimember
districts,
i
think
they
would
have
said
so.
consistently,
there
has
been
nothing
along
that
line
intimated.
now,
on
bexar
county
i
just
want
to
again
say
this,
may
it
please
the
court
that
what
the
court
said
in
effect
of
the
trial
court
is
we
are
condemning
it
not
because
it
operated
to
dilute
or
cancel
the
votes
cast
by
the
mexicans-americans
which
i
think
is
the
test
that
we
all
want
to
apply.
here
what
the
court
said
in
effect
is
we
believe
that
this
way,
in
the
hypothesis
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
applied,
we
believe
this
will
encourage
more
mexican-americans
to
vote.
well,
of
course,
we
cannot
accept
this
in
the
test
as
a
fact
theory
and
then
determining
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
before
the
court
here.
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
can
just
say
this
to
you.
if
i
saw
anything
in
the
record
at
all,
anything
that
showed
that
it
was
done
as
a
result
of
doing
more
than
just
seeking
to
comply,
with
what
the
legislators
had
said
they
thought
was
appropriate
in
those
districts,
then
i
would
have
some
trouble
with
it
too.
but
i
find
nothing.
mr.
leon
jaworski
they
could
have,
yes.
i
mean
except,
unless
you
get
on
some
very
(inaudible)
some
very
great
refinements
which
very
frankly
i
would
not
even
suggest
although
you
do
have
a
difference
in
size.
you
do
have
some
difference.
you
would
find
it
perhaps
more
acceptable
in
houston
than
you
would
in
dallas
county.
there
is
a
considerable
difference
in
the
size
of
the
two.
there
is
a
considerable
difference
in
the
way
the
two
metropolitan
areas
actually
lie.
one
is
much
more
compact
than
the
other
one.
but
all
i
just
have
to
frankly
say
that
if
there
were
anything
here
that
suggested
that
it
had
been
done
for
the
purpose
of
diluting
or
canceling
strength
of
any
group,
i
would
immediately
say
that
there
was
a
serious
question
with
respect
to
it
but
you
just
will
not
find
that
in
the
record.
this
is
why
i
say
that
there
is
nothing,
absent
something
that
cast
down
upon
it
or
that
shows
that
it
was
done
for
some
ulterior
purpose
or
that
there
is
some
lack
of
good
faith
involved.
i
would
say
that
there
is
nothing
to
keep
state
from
having
both
multimember
and
single-member
districts
and
some
of
its
localities.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
was
true
in
the
case
argued
just
before,
that's
one
the
attorney
general
of
the
texas,
the
honorable
john
l.
hill
has
participated
in
the
preparation
of
this
appeal.
he
has
the
staff
with
us,
and
in
order
to
avoid
the
providing
of
arguments,
he
has
asked
that
i
present
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
state.
i
think
it
perhaps
a
more
accurate
description
of
what
this
case
really
involves
could
hardly
be
made
and
the
characterization
given
it
by
the
central
judge
who
stated
that
this
was
an
instance
of
the
majority
entering
fields
of
the
purely
state
and
local
management.
now
under
the
provisions
of
article
3,
section
28
of
the
constitution
of
texas,
a
legislative
redistricting
board
has
assembled,
if
the
legislature
fails
to
redistrict
the
state
after
its
first
regular
session
following
the
publication
of
each
united
states
decennial
census.
so
the
legislature
convened
in
january
1971,
was
under
constitutional
mandate,
to
provide
this
redistricting.
our
texas
has
a
bicameral
legislature,
and
because
the
legislature
had
failed
to
redistrict
in
both
houses,
of
course,
any
effort
at
redistricting
failed
and
as
a
consequence,
the
redistricting
board
was
assembled
and
considered
the
matter
of
providing
a
plan
of
redistricting
the
senate,
and
also
a
plan
of
redistricting
the
lower
house.
now,
this
board
consists
as
constituted
by
several
elected
officials,
state
officials
serving
on
it.
there
is
the
lieutenant
governor,
the
speaker
of
the
house,
the
attorney
general,
the
comptroller
of
public
accounts,
and
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office.
now
three
or
more
of
these
members
of
the
redistricting
board
may
assign
whatever
plan
they
agree
upon,
and
it
certify
to
the
secretary
of
state,
and
then
it
becomes
an
effective
plan.
now,
i
might
say
that
the
house
plan
is
the
only
one.
the
plan
relating
to
the
representative
is
the
only
plan
that's
involved
on
this
appeal.
perhaps,
brief
reference
should
be
made
to
the
commencement
of
those
litigation
after
they
planned
to
file,
a
suit
was
instituted
in
houston,
texas
by
curtis
graves,
a
black
state
representative
from
harris
county
that?s
huston
in
which
he
contended
that
there
was
unconstitutional
apportionment
of
the
senatorial
districts
because
of
an
alleged
racial
gerrymandering.
his
point
being
that
there
should
have
been
district
carved
out
in
which
80%
are
blacks
and
that
because
one
was
not
carved
out
in
that
matter
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
then
next
came,
a
number
of
others
civil
suits
that
were
filled
challenging
the
boards
plan
for
the
house
of
representatives
in
different
parts
of
the
state
with
different
groups,
filing
these
suits,
and
interventions
were
also
filled
on
behalf
of
a
number
of
groups
and
there
was
a
consolidation
of
all
of
these
actions
and
they
were
heard
before
the
three-judge
court.
now,
the
court
ordered
first
that
unless
the
legislature
of
texas
on
or
before
july
of
the
1,
1973,
adopted
a
plan
to
reapportion
the
legislative
districts
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
guideline
set
out
in
the
court's
opinion
that
the
court
will
then
proceed
to
reapportion
the
state
itself,
and
then
the
court
further
ordered
that
the
counties
of
dallas,
that
is
where
the
city
of
dallas
is
and
the
county
of
bexar
that's
where
san
antonio
is
that
both
of
these,
the
reapportioned
into
single-member
representative
districts
in
conformance
with
a
plan
of
reapportionment
that
the
court
provided.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes
sir,
an
injunctive
relief,
excuse
me
sir.
the
injunctive
relief
consisted
all
of
the
state
being
restrained
from
proceeding.
the
elections
could
not
be
held
in
accordance
with
the
plan
that
had
been
filed
by
the
redistricting
board.
a
judge
would
say,
state
it
very
frankly
that
he'll
wholeheartedly
disagree
with
his
colleagues
in
declaring
the
state
plan
unconstitutional,
saying
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
that
illustrated
more
vividly
the
chaos
that
existed
in
the
area
of
restructuring
the
political
districts
of
a
state
as
was
attempted
to
be
done
and
ordered
by
the
court
in
this
particular
instance.
it'd
be
done
by
july
1,
1973
or
else
of
course
the
plan
had
to
be
adopted.
of
course
the
mahan
versus
howell
case
is
very
significant.
a
number
of
the
courts'
pronouncements
in
that
case
are
quite
applicable
here.
perhaps
i
should
point
out
that
what
the
majority
did
in
our
case
was
relied
on
the
kirkpatrick
versus
preisler
case
and
repeatedly
refrying
to
it
also
on
wells
versus
rockefeller,
both
which
is
we
know
are
congressional
redistricting
cases.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
what
this
court
of
course
said
in
the
mahan
and
howell
case.
mr.
leon
jaworski
and
also
said
it,
yes
sir
in
the
reynolds
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
right
sir,
but
it
was
quite
well
emphasized
in
a
case
that
was
decided
or
relevant
in
[voice
overlap]
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
it
did
some
reemphasizing
and
perhaps
having
come
so
recently
or
something
that
we
might
talk
about
little
more,
but
let
me
just
pass
counsel,
but
certainly
there
was
nothing
new
in
it.
the
interesting
thing
is
that
judge
wood
who
so
strongly
dissented
in
this
case
from
the
actual
majority,
recognized
that
difference
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
and
he
recognized
the
difference
between
congressional
districts
and
legislative
districts,
pointing
to
the
cases,
pointing
to
reynolds
versus
sims.
now
what
the
majority
did
here
was
required,
first
a
much
stricter
standard
of
state
legislative
reapportionment,
permissible
deviation
and
had
been
approved
theretofore.
actually
in
this
case
the
total
variation
of
9.9%
under
the
board
was
on
question
thus
far
as
the
majority
opinion
was
concerned.
i
notice
wherein
in
one
of
the
briefs
some
question
was
raised
whether
that
might
be
entirely
accurate,
but
there
had
been
nothing
before
the
lower
court
raised
any
question
beyond
that
of
it
being
assumed
and
considered
that
the
total
variation
was
only
9.9%.
now,
this
was
under
the
board's
redistricting
plan.
i
should
point
out
that
actually
the
average
variation
was
only
1.82%.
now
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case,
a
matter
on
which
so
very
much
stress
was
laid
by
majority
the
court
which
in
our
view
led
the
court
exactly
to
nothing
as
far
as
the
end
result
was
concerned,
where
the
procedural
(inaudible)
is
simply
followed
by
this
board.
there
were
several
tings
that
took
place.
of
course
these
men,
all
of
them
had
to
depend
upon
staff
assistance
because
they
had
other
duties
to
perform
as
state
officials
and
they
did
have
considerable
staff
assistance.
perhaps
the
one
official
who
participated
more
than
any
one
else
in
this
particular
matter
was
the
attorney
general
himself
who
counseled
with
the
redistricting
board
constantly
on
what
should
be
done
and
also
letting
him
know
on
the
what
was
permissibly
legal
as
he
interpreted
the
decisions.
but
the
court
has
gone
to
considerable
extent
in
talking
about,
not
the
end
results
so
much
as
these
procedures
that
was
employed
in
finding
fault
with
them,
and
finding
fault
with
the
particular
assistance
that
had
been
rendered
by
members
of
the
staff
and
such
as
that
forgetting
it
seems
to
me
at
least
for
a
moment
that
even
judges
need
the
assistance
or
at
least
utilize
the
assistance
of
law
clerks
at
times.
but,
also
it
is
very
clear,
there
was
a
complete
misapprehension
of
whitcomb
versus
chavis
actually
said.
what
the
court
here
did
was
not
only
indicated,
went
into
the
matter
of
redistricting
the
entire
state
also
found
fault
with
what
had
been
specifically
insofar
as
single
and
multi-member
districts
were
concerned
and
the
two
counties
that
i
mentioned.
what
the
court
failed
to
do
as
we
see
it
was
to
employ
the
equal
protection
test
and
that
a
state
must
make
an
honest
and
a
good-faith
effort
to
construct
the
districts
as
nearly
of
equal
population
as
is
practicable
and
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
in
this
record
that
this
good-faith
effort
was
not
made.
and
let
me
regress
for
a
moment
if
i
may,
because
i
have
noted
that
there
were
some
references
made
in
some
of
the
briefs
to
some
alleged
evidence
in
this
case
that
frankly
is
no
evidence.
what
happened
at
the
outset
was
that
the
chief
judge
of
this
three-judge
court,
the
presiding
judge
and
announced
that
everything
that
was
offered
by
anyone
would
be
admitted
in
evidence.
he
didn't
want
us
to
even
make
any
objections.
if
the
matter
was
conjectural,
if
it
was
hearsay
or
whatever
the
proper
objection
may
have
been
it
went
into
the
record
anyway
and
the
announcement
being
that
the
court
would
at
the
end
consider
those
things
that
were
admissible
on
those
matters
that
were
not
admissible,
but
there
were
no
rulings
ever
made
by
the
court
and
as
a
consequence
the
floodgates
were
opened
and
everybody
led
into
thinking
that
you
want
to
bring
before
the
court
just
introduced
it
into
evidence
and
then
proceed.
we
don't
know
actually
what
the
court
did
consider
and
what
it
didn't
consider
speaking
of
the
majority.
but,
we
do
know
that
there
were
some
matters
tendered
here
that
were
not
admissible
in
evidence
and
that
the
record
presently
is
cluttered
with
some
of
those
matters.
i
mention
that
simply
because
what
should
really
be
a
relatively
a
easy
case
to
discuss
with
the
court
and
the
issues
being
well
defined
as
we
see
it,
is
complicated
a
little
because
of
some
of
the
references
that
have
been
made
in
some
of
the
briefs
to
what
the
evidence
purportedly
showed.
now,
the
court,
the
majority,
apparently
everywhere
just
placed
the
burden
upon
the
state.
it
may,
you
know
to
show
that
there
was
no
inequality
of
any
kind,
that
there
was
no
discrimination
of
any
kind,
that
there
wasn't
any
type
of
dilution
and
had
us
carry
the
burden
throughout
the
case.
so,
far
as
i
tell
we
discharged
the
burden
although
it
is
questionable
as
to
whether
we
had
the
burden
in
all
of
these
instances.
now
texas
is
a
large
state
as
is
known,
we
will
not
engage
in
talking
about
how
large
it
is,
but
it's
not
only
a
large
one,
but
it
is
also
has
a
shape
and
it
does
not
render
it
very
easily
susceptible
to
a
division
among
districts.
so,
some
problem
is
going
to
be
encountered,
but
we
actually
--
what
was
necessary
here
were
--
well,
let
me
say
first
the
ideal
district
was
about
74,000,
seventy
four
thousand
plus.
there
were
a
150
representatives
to
be
elected
to
the
lower
house
and
a
large
number
of
districts
had
to
be
carved
out
in
addition
to
it.
this
particular
board
was
confronted
with
a
decision
--
first
with
the
provision
of
the
constitution
of
our
state
which
had
been
interpreted
in
the
case
of
craddick
versus
smith
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
under
that
county
lines
could
not
be
crossed,
unless
it
were
absolutely
necessary
to
do
it
in
order
to
make
up
this
district
of
74,000,
the
ideal.
it
also
required
that
it
go
to
a
contagious
county
if
it
were
necessary
to
do
that.
now,
texas
as
we
know
and
as
the
court
doubtless
knows,
not
only
has
this
large
metropolitan
cities,
but
it
has
rural
areas
that
has
large
areas
that
are
very
sparsely
settled.
now
actually
there
was
no
instance
in
which
our
constitutional
requirements
and
the
integrity
that
was
required
for
this
board
to
follow
was
not
carefully
embraced
in
each
instance
with
the
possible
exception,
well
would
be
exception
of
red
river
county
and
there
we
had
a
real
problem
up
in
the
part
that
adjoins
arkansas
with
the
red
river
and
between
the
two
of
them
had
a
problem
as
to
buren
county.
so,
what
was
actually
done
is
that
in
that
one
instance
the
county
line,
it
was
crossed.
now,
the
total
population
incidentally
as
the
court
probably
has
already
gathered
from
what
i
had
said
is
according
to
the
last
census
about
eleven
million
two
hundred
thousand.
the
senatorial
district
is
not
involved
here,
but
maybe
of
interest
of
the
court
is
of
approximately
360,000
to
368,000.
now,
if
we
were
to
draw
comparisons
here
and
i
do
this
only
because
a
case
has
just
been
decided
by
this
court
and
to
show
a
similarity
of
the
situations
if
i
may
reveal
those
in
the
virginia,
there
was
a
total
variation
of
16.4
under
what
the
board
that
here,
the
total
variation
of
9.9
and
average
variation
in
the
mahan
case
of
3.89
in
texas
of
1.82.
within
the
4%
there
were
35
of
the
districts
in
virginia.
in
texas
we
had
93
under
this
board's
plan.
those
that
exceeded
6%
were
9
in
virginia,
there
were
none
under
this
board's
plan
in
texas
and
only
two
exceeded
the
5%.
i
indicated
a
few
moments
ago
that
it
was
our
view
that
what
whitcomb
v.
chavis
had
been
misinterpreted
and
we
do
feel
that
that
is
definitely
in
the
case.
i
want
to
mention
one
effort
that
was
made
in
particular,
that
was
injunction
in
the
case
the
fact
that
perhaps
one
difference
was
that
in
indiana
particular
the
marion
county
which
was
involved
in
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis
case
that
there
was
no
racial
history
and
a
suggestion
was
made
the
texas
had
a
racial
history.
here
is
no
one
that
would
deny
that
texas
has
true
what
so
many
of
the
states
has
a
racial
legacy.
it
is
untrue
that
there
is
any
showing
whatever
that
there
has
been
any
such
happenings,
any
sort
of
racial
violation
with
respect
to
the
electoral
process
in
our
state.
the
last
one
according
to
testimony
in
this
case
undisputed
is
coming
from
a
witness
who
appeared
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
was
back
in
1956.
so
that
this
is
really
not
in
the
case
despite
the
fact
the
witness
was
put
on
the
stand
to
testify
that
or
undertake
to
testify
and
this
is
one
of
the
particular
matters
to
which
i
refer
that
has
made
it
somewhat
difficult
to
briefly
argue
this
case
because
the
court
admitted
everything.
man
who
opposed
does
an
expert
and
undertook
to
say
that
there
was
a
difference
as
far
as
racial
history
in
indianapolis
and
marion
county
was
concerned
and
in
texas.
and
then
it
turned
out
when
i
asked
them
the
question
on
cross
examination
that
he
had
never
even
been
to
indiana
much
less
indianapolis
had
not
made
any
type
of
study
of
the
matter
and
as
i
said
in
our
brief
to
show
what
we
had
to
contend
with.
i
should
say
that
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record
in
order
to
lay
at
rest
completely
the
matter
of
all
having
been
free
to
engage
in
our
process
of
registration
as
well
as
holding,
there
is
a
stipulation
that
there
has
been
and
none
of
that
in
our
state
for
a
number
of
years
and
of
course
the
evidence
shows
nothing
of
the
kind.
now,
we
get
into
another
phase
that
i
want
to
discuss
with
the
court
if
i
may
and
that
has
what
happened
with
respect
to
harris
county,
houston
under
the
boards
plan
being
divided
into
single
member
districts
and
what
happened
and
so
far
as
dallas
--
it
is
dallas
county
and
san
antonio
bear
county
being
multimember
districts.
now
there
of
course
is
some
difference
one
could
say
huston
a
very
large
city,
a
million
seven
hundred
thousand
either
fifth
or
sixth
largest
city
of
the
nation
at
the
present
time.
dallas,
a
million
three,
dallas
county.
san
antonio,
even
a
much
smaller
city
than
that,
traditionally
dallas
had
multi
member
districts
same
was
true
of
bexar
county.
and
as
far
as
huston
is
concerned
harris
county
the
legislators
themselves,
the
delegation
from
their
more
or
less
favored
single
member
districts.
so
on
the
surface
you
might
say
why
does
the
harris
county
have
single
member
districts
and
why
does
dallas
and
bexar
county
have
multiple
member
districts?
really
it
was
done
without
to
being
the
slightest
intimation
on
the
record
that
in
the
individual
group
sacrificed
any
constitutional
rights
by
virtue
of
it,
it
was
done
largely
because
the
board
had
before
it
witnesses
who
thought
that
this
was
a
sensible
thing
to
do
in
harris
county
had
witnesses
before
that
thought
it
was
a
sensible
thing
to
do
in
dallas
and
bexar
county
what
was
done
in
those.
now
our
position
is
they
tops
in,
the
showing
of
something
that
shows
that
either
voting
strength
is
being
diluted
or
that
something
has
been
done
that
has
occasioned
the
transpiration
of
a
constitutional
right
that
certainly
much
has
been
made
of
nothing.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no
sir
this
is
--
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that
sir,
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that
that
was
true
as
far
as
dallas
was
concerned
and
i
believe
bexar
county
because
they
have
--
but
it
was
not
true
as
far
as
harris
county
is
concern.
harris
county
had
some
election
in
past
they
have
floatorial
representative
or
even.
i
said
what
really
brought
it
on
more
than
anything
else
is
a
delegation
should
come
from
these
particular
areas
and
the
board
in
shifting
what
people
wanted
but
their
representative
said
they
want,
made
these
provisions
of
single
member
districts
for
huston,
for
harris
county
multimember
for
dallas
and
for
bexar
county.
mr.
leon
jaworski
dallas
and
bexar
historically
have
had
multi
member.
mr.
leon
jaworski
has
had
but
also
some
mixture
mr.
justice
stewart
there
have
been
mixtures
of
floatorial
representative
and
such
as
that
are
whole
voters.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
may
have
been
in
the
history
of
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
do
not
think
that
this
was
a
part
of
what
was
before
the
board,
i
do
want
to
make
mention
of
this.
now
you
take
bexar
county
for
example,
this
is
as
county
of
san
antonio
where
a
large
segment
of
the
population
is
mexican
american,
actually
50%
of
them
are.
you
don't
have
a
minority
there
of
mexican
americans
toll,
the
record
shows
that
if
they
undertook
to
exercise
the
election
process
they
are
right
to
vote,
they
are
register
in
vote,
there
would
not
be
any
problem.
the
problem
is
been
that
less
than
30%
of
more
approximately
30%
of
them
seek
to
exercise
that
privilege.
this
is
where
your
trouble
has
been
as
far
as
bexar
county
is
concerned.
i
should
make
mention
of
this
too
because
it?s
in
the
record,
no
matter
that
probably
will
be
talked
about.
dallas
county
has
a
strong
political
party;
it?s
a
party
that
has
had
on
it
slate,
blacks
as
well
as
whites.
here
the
record
shows
that
they
were
contemplating
three
blacks
on
their
slate
following
this
active
redistricting,
actually
that
they
have
had
at
different
levels
are
just
even
include
in
the
legislative
level
black
on
the
slate
before,
that
is
true
that
it
is
as
strong
political
organization
it
is
true
that
a
black
placed
on
that
slate
probably
would
be
elected
is
also
true
when
a
white
placed
on
that
slate
would
be
elected.
it
is
also
true
that
if
this
organization
opposed
a
white
that
he
would
hard
time
been
elected,
just
as
much
as
if
the
organization
opposed
a
black.
the
while
routed
in
history
as
i
answered
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
the
matter
of
multimember
districts
has
never
been
used
in
dallas
and
direct
this
completely
silent,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
multimember
district
arrangement
for
dallas
county
was
used
or
conceived
either
to
dilute
or
cancel
the
voting
strength
of
blacks
and
i
think
that
this
distinguishes
it
from
some
other
and
inferences
and
pronouncements
that
had
been
made
by
this
court
in
other
cases
and
i
believe
with
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
court.
i
will
wait
with
the
concluding
argument
until
after
counsel
for
the
(inaudible).
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
jurisdictional
question
i
think
it
perhaps
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
by
a
members
of
the
court
who
have
brought
out
the
basis
on
which
we
argued
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
and
i
would
merely
say
to
the
court
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
cases
that
are
applicable,
we
also
have
undertaken
to
show
to
the
court
that
the
cases
on
which
the
appellees
rely
are
not
applicable.
actually,
what
has
been
done
here
has
a
state
wide
impact.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no
sir,
no
sir.
what
happened
was
that
a
part
of
the
appeal,
you
may
recall,
this
court
entered
a
judgment,
the
appeal
that
came
from
harris
county
and
they
remembered
that
the
court
entered
a
judgment
dismissing
that
part,
not
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
but
for
other
reasons.
in
any
event,
this
has
been
fully
briefed,
i
don?t
think
that
i
need
to
take
the
time
of
the
court.
actually,
i
did
not
see
because
the
rule
first
that
this
actually
had
a
state
wide
impact
but
secondly,
also
the
pendant
jurisdiction
rule;
i
had
not
taken
the
time
to
really
argue
that
for
the
court
and
the
original
argument.
now,
passing
on
to
something
else
and
mr.
justice
stewart
did
ask
me
about
the
history
with
respect
to
harris
county
and
it
was
that
history
with
respect
to
houston,
harris
county
that
i
undertook
to
say
i
was
not
fully
familiar
with.
the
history
as
to
dallas
county
has
been
one
consistently
of
multimember
districts
but
as
far
harris
county
is
concerned,
i
answer
that
they
were
floterial
districts
in
1965;
there
were
three
multimember
districts
in
1966,
five
multimember
districts
in
1971.
now,
this
is
the
history
as
the
record
shows
it
to
be.
i
merely
pointed
out
because
harris
county
did
have
some
history
of
some
multimember
districts.
but
it
also
has
a
history
that
really
shows
more
that
there
has
been
a
division
and
when
we
speak
of
polls,
for
instance,
in
dallas
county
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
polls,
i
think
we
get
into
some
difficulty
because
the
polls
as
we
know,
if
they
are
going
to
be
polls
relate
to
how
well
a
candidate
is
running,
they
may
have
some
inaccuracy
but
i
wasn?t
referring
to
polls,
i
was
referring
to
what
had
actually
been
requested
to
all
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
and
the
record
shows
this.
the
legislators
had
been
known
the
wishes
with
respect
to
what
they
wanted
in
harris
county
and
also
what
the
situation
was
as
desired
in
the
other
counties.
now,
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
policy,
actually
i
don?t
know
where
the
idea
got
into
the
record
that
there
had
been
any
state
policy
with
respect
to
the
matter,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
was
raised
a
question
you
referred
to
where
15
district
matters
arose.
what
actually
happened
was
that
the
limitation
was
never
offered
in
a
state
policy
at
one
time,
the
house
committee
on
congressional
and
legislative
districts
had
felt
that
multimember
district
should
be
somewhat
limited
in
size
because
of
the
voting
machine
problem.
now
these
changes
in
the
voting
machines
and
the
difficulty
of
getting
them
and
the
difficulty
of
their
cost
and
placing
so
many
of
them
did
raise
a
question
but
this
was
largely
done
to
accommodate
a
new
change
that
had
been
made
in
the
voting
machines.
the
limitation
was
never
offered
as
a
state
policy
as
this
record
will
show
and
there
is
no
indication
as
i
read
the
kilgarlin
case
that
the
court
assured
or
was
assured
that
the
limitation
would
be
continued
in
future
apportionment
plans.
this
is
just
simply
something
that
we
find
unable
to
follow
completely.
then
when
we
speak
of
single-member
and
multimember
districts
or
single-member
districts
throughout
the
state,
there?s
an
interesting
texas
supreme
court
case
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it?s
the
mauzy
case
as
we
also
referred
to
it
and
they
are
in
the
texas
supreme
court
refuge
to
grant
the
relator?s
request
that
the
board
be
ordered
to
use
single-member
districts
throughout
the
state.
and
you?ll
also
find
in
the
smith
versus
craddick
case
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
found,
and
this
is
the
texas
supreme
court
talking
about
multimember
districts
itself
as
they
found
that
in
any
part
of
the
state,
there
was
an
unfairness
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
multimember
districts,
i
think
they
would
have
said
so.
consistently,
there
has
been
nothing
along
that
line
intimated.
now,
on
bexar
county
i
just
want
to
again
say
this,
may
it
please
the
court
that
what
the
court
said
in
effect
of
the
trial
court
is
we
are
condemning
it
not
because
it
operated
to
dilute
or
cancel
the
votes
cast
by
the
mexicans-americans
which
i
think
is
the
test
that
we
all
want
to
apply.
here
what
the
court
said
in
effect
is
we
believe
that
this
way,
in
the
hypothesis
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
applied,
we
believe
this
will
encourage
more
mexican-americans
to
vote.
well,
of
course,
we
cannot
accept
this
in
the
test
as
a
fact
theory
and
then
determining
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
before
the
court
here.
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
can
just
say
this
to
you.
if
i
saw
anything
in
the
record
at
all,
anything
that
showed
that
it
was
done
as
a
result
of
doing
more
than
just
seeking
to
comply,
with
what
the
legislators
had
said
they
thought
was
appropriate
in
those
districts,
then
i
would
have
some
trouble
with
it
too.
but
i
find
nothing.
mr.
leon
jaworski
they
could
have,
yes.
i
mean
except,
unless
you
get
on
some
very
(inaudible)
some
very
great
refinements
which
very
frankly
i
would
not
even
suggest
although
you
do
have
a
difference
in
size.
you
do
have
some
difference.
you
would
find
it
perhaps
more
acceptable
in
houston
than
you
would
in
dallas
county.
there
is
a
considerable
difference
in
the
size
of
the
two.
there
is
a
considerable
difference
in
the
way
the
two
metropolitan
areas
actually
lie.
one
is
much
more
compact
than
the
other
one.
but
all
i
just
have
to
frankly
say
that
if
there
were
anything
here
that
suggested
that
it
had
been
done
for
the
purpose
of
diluting
or
canceling
strength
of
any
group,
i
would
immediately
say
that
there
was
a
serious
question
with
respect
to
it
but
you
just
will
not
find
that
in
the
record.
this
is
why
i
say
that
there
is
nothing,
absent
something
that
cast
down
upon
it
or
that
shows
that
it
was
done
for
some
ulterior
purpose
or
that
there
is
some
lack
of
good
faith
involved.
i
would
say
that
there
is
nothing
to
keep
state
from
having
both
multimember
and
single-member
districts
and
some
of
its
localities.
i
thank
the
court.
