let?s
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
validity
of
the
entire
state
plan
is
here,
assuming
the
jurisdiction
of
the
issue,
the
district
court
upset
the
entire
plan
based
on
three
things.
one,
variation
--
unknown
speaker
now,
did
that
variation
on
the
numbers
reach,
harris,
dallas
and
bexar
counties
--
what
is
the
motive
when
the
district
issue
had
not
been
here?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
about
some
parts
of
the
plan
were
invalidated
solely
on
deviation?
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
now
on
the
multimember
district
rational,
that
was
because
harris
was
divided
and
the
other
metropolitan
areas
were
or
were
not?
unknown
speaker
but,
there
are
other
metropolitan
areas
that
had
multimember
districts
and
they
didn't
touch
those.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that
was
because
there
wasn't
any
finding
with
respect
to
racial
--
unknown
speaker
other
than
the
racial
item,
the
district
court
would
have
contemplated
handling
all
metropolitan
areas
the
same
one
way
or
another,
absolute
racial?
unknown
speaker
but
conveniently
they
would
have
--
unknown
speaker
now
that
--
left
existing,
what
they
said
wasn't
rational.
unknown
speaker
and
the
bexar,
you
could
either
--
you
will
touch
upon
the
suggestion
made
by
your
opposition
that
the
one
of
the
reasons
is
the
mexican
americans
don't
turn
out
to
vote.
