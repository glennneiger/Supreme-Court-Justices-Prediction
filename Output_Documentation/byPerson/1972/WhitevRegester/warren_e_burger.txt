mr.
jaworski,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jaworski,
has
the
court
has
said
at
least
once
and
perhaps
more
often
that
a
good
deal
more
flexibility
is
permitted
in
state
legislature
then
in
congressional
districts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
have
said
it
before
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
reynolds
against
sims.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
there
was
nothing
new
in
mahan
against
howell
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
jaworski.
mr.
richards.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
something
you
said,
it
comes
me
to
ask
this
question
and
i'll
try
not
to
take
too
much
time
for
that.
suppose
in
a
large
county
like
harris,
it
was
demonstrable
that
there
was
no
racial
problem
at
all,
but
that
republicans
were
concentrated
in
certain
areas
and
democrats
in
the
larger
areas
and
that
the
democrats
in
an
at-large
situation
could
dominated
in
definitely,
electing
all
of
their
party
members,
do
you
think
that
gives
rise
to
a
constitutional
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
part
ever
indicated
that
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
in
that
kind
of
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
hasn't
been
held.
suppose
the
catholics
for
example
were
concentrated
in
one
area
and
non-catholics
of
all
kinds
in
another.
would
you
say
that
gives
rise
to
a
constitutional
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
assuming
any
of
that,
just
arguing
them
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
this
religious
hypothesis
that
i
gave
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
assume
it's
a
reality
that
people
who
are
catholics
tend
to
?
want
to
live
in
areas
where
there
are
catholic
churches
or
if
they
are
none
to
build
them
and
so,
it's
not
surprising
if
they
happen
to
be
concentrated,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
seen
all
constitutional
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
i
am
not
trying
to
see
how
far
this
problem
of
dealing
with
abstract
minorities
is
carried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
has
used
the
term
identifiable
minority.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
idar.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
idar.
mr.
gee,
the
arguments
seems
to
be
made
as
i
am
following
that
a
minority,
any
kind
of
a
minority
is
entitled
to
have
the
area
structured,
so
that
it
can
get
the
maximum
amount
of
representation
without
respect
to
whether
they
do
or
do
not
register
the
voter
is
denied
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view
how
many
people
should
be
in
the
district
for
the
state
legislature
under
the
constitution?
under
the
federal
constitution,
how
many
people
assured
to
be
in
the
district?
chief

i
am
not
talking
about
the
federal
i
am
