mr.
david
r.
richards
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice.
we
--
let
me
open
with
the
brief
luminary
we
are
dividing
our
45
minutes
between
three
counsel,
i
would
attempt
to
open
to
discuss
the
what
we
consider
to
be
the
underlying
irrationality
of
the
state
plan
and
the
dilution
of
the
negroes
voter
vote
in
dallas
county.
mr.
idar
will
follow
discussing
the
underlying
distinctions
we
think
on
this
record
between
whitcomb
v.
chavis
and
the
impact
of
the
at-large
scheme
on
the
mexican
american
minority
of
bexar
county.
mr.
gee
on
behalf
of
state
republican
party
will
follow
to
discuss
what
everything
we
forget
including
jurisdiction
and
i
think
the
inordinate
costs
of
election
campaigns
in
the
county
which
would
suggestive.
as
a
preliminary
matter
the
order
below
is
a
first,
it?s
a
complicated
four
part,
four
law
suits
consolidating
with
various
contentions
i
guess
the
order
below
is
of
two
parts.
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
which
does
feed
to
the
statewide
apportionment
plan
but
that
was
not
effectuated
by
injunction
but
rather
it
was
left
to
be
operative
only
in
july
of
this
year
and
the
event
the
legislature
did
not
address
themselves
to
it.
there
was
injunctive
relief
it
was
narrow.
it
effected
only
two
counties
and
the
state
of
texas
those
counties
of
dallas
and
bexar
their
single
member
district
plans
were
implemented
by
the
court
unanimously
judge
wood
who
have
did
descent
from
the
other
portions
for
the
court's
opinion
below
agreed
that
this
was
so
egregious
in
dallas
and
bexar
county
that
implementation
of
immediate
single
member
districts
was
in
order.
so
we
think
the
jurisdictional
issue
is
in
the
case
mr.
gee
will
address
himself
to
it.
the
route
problem
that
confronted
the
texas
legislature
when
it
or
readily
redistricting
board
when
it
began
to
consider
the
reapportionment
to
the
texas
legislature
was
what
to
do
with
the
urban
counties.
the
testimony
is
clear
that
this
was
in
words
of
one
witness
enraging
controversy
across
state
of
texas.
hearings
were
held
by
the
legislative
redistricting
board
on
two
occasions
concerning
what
was
to
be
done
all
of
the
witnesses
who
appeared
were
concerned
only
with
this
single
issue.
urban
counties
of
dallas,
bexar
and
harris
whether
to
be
divided
into
individual
districts
or
something
last
then
at
large
are
worthy
to
left
at
large.
now
the
board
and
what
is
remains
and
orderly
unarticulated
decisions
decided
to
divide
harris
county
in
the
23
individual
member
districts
and
to
leave
and
dallas
and
bexar
county
running
at
large
dallas
has
become
what
we
all
saying
recognized
to
be
the
largest
legislative
districts
in
the
nations
history.
18
legislators
elected
from
at-large
of
one
million
four
hundred
thousand
people.
no
requirement
of
geographic
distribution
they
could
all
come
from
one
city
block
with
in
the
city
of
dallas.
now
the
peculiarity
here
quite
granted
there
was
a
history
of
at-large
representation
in
the
urban
cities
of
texas.
it
was
true
of
all
the
cities
of
texas
until
1965
when
the
texas
legislature
did
for
the
first
time
a
portion
harris
county,
huston
into
something
less
than
the
county
wide
districts
at
that
time
in
kilgarlin
v.
martin
the
state
of
texas
explained
to
the
federal
courts
that
a
policy
existed
and
that
policy
was
at
anytime
a
county
became
a
one
million
in
size,
or
more
than
15
legislators,
it
became
simply
unworkable
to
run
at-large
and
that
in
the
future,
then
anytime
a
county
became
that
size,
that
county
itself
would
be
a
portion
down
in
something
less
than
at-large
representation.
well,
then
dallas
county
hit
a
million
for
this
year,
larger
than
harris
was
an
65.
that
policy
went
by
the
board
without
even
whisper
on
the
part
of
the
board
members.
of
this
legislative
redistricting
board,
three
of
them
had
been
defendants
in
the
kilgarlin
case
who
presumably
had
the
sparse
of
that
explanation
for
the
--
at
that
time
for
the
apportionment
of
harris
county.
at
no
time,
although
now
in
their
reply
brief,
the
court
--
the
appellant
say
that
that
really
never
was
a
policy.
they
certainly
never
told
the
court
that,
the
court's
opinion
it
was
a
policy.
when
the
appeal
papers
were
filed
here,
there's
no
indication
of
any
disclaimer
of
that
policy
when
the
kilgarlin
v.
martin
was
considered
here
as
kilgarlin
v.
hill.
the
only
reason
that
appears
ever
for
this
rather
curious
treatment
of
the
two
counties
was
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed
by
the
appellants
and
they
suggested
there
that
the
reason
they
left
dallas
county
at-large
was
the
dominant
democratic
organization
dallas
county
preferred
to
take
when
they
will
take
all
election.
they
have
not
sponsored
that
as
their
reason
in
their
subsequent
briefs.
we
talked
about
the
board
procedures
in
our
briefs
and
we
did
deal
with
it,
not
because
we
want
to
go
behind
the
board
or
not
because
they
want
to
indite
what
they
did
because
they
did
it
on
a
sloppy
manner
but
because
it
points
to
no
rational
state
policy
that
underlies
this
very
crucial
decision
in
terms
of
how
people
are
going
to
be
elected
in
a
county,
the
size
of
dallas.
500,000
registered
voters
in
that
county
to
which
any
person
who
seeks
to
be
elected
to
the
legislature
must
somehow
communicate.
the
last
general
primary
election
in
dallas
had
68
races
on
it,
3+
congressional
seats,
3+
state
senate
seats
and
a
submerged
15
member
legislative
delegation.
results
of
this
rather
whims
or
goal
if
you
will,
if
not
penal
decision
with
respect
to
dallas
of
course
is
to
isolate
the
black
minority
of
that
city
which
has
suffered
a
traditional
isolation
that
this
record
speaks
to
quite
strongly
and
just
simply
and
intolerable
bind,
there
is
no
relief.
texas
remains
a
one-party
state,
this
is
not
a
situation
such
as
indiana
in
which
conceivably
the
explanation
for
the
under-representation
of
the
ghetto
was
winning
and
losing
elections
in
november.
what
happens
in
texas
is,
you
win
or
lose
in
a
democratic
primary,
the
democratic
primary
is
a
majority
place
system
that
means
and
order
to
obtain
the
nomination,
you
must
--
if
you
are
a
black
candidate,
ultimately
be
pitted
vis-a-v
a
white
candidate,
in
a
county
in
which
racial
segregation,
discrimination
has
still
been
the
order
of
the
day,
granted
it
diminishes,
but
as
this
record
establishes,
it
diminishes
rather
slowly.
what
this
record
further
shows
is
that
the
dominant
political
organization
of
that
county,
the
dcrg,
when
circumstances
require
and
their
candidates
are
threatened
by
a
black
candidate
or
by
a
candidate
that
has
the
support
of
the
negro
minority,
they
simply
try
out
the
old
game
of
race
in
order
to
win.
in
1970,
two
candidates
made
it
into
the
run-off,
democratic
primary
run-off
against
the
dcrg
candidates,
the
dcrg
being
a
private
sort
of
modern
day
chambered
association,
of
course
we
are
concerned.
in
that
run-off,
the
dcrg
mailed
to
some
--
the
white
voters
of
dallas
county,
literature
saying
?black
voting
tactics
will
take
place
in
the
south
dallas,
the
negro
area
of
dallas.
if
you
don't
get
out
to
propose
him
vote,?
and
it
said
the
philosophy
of
these
candidates
is
best
described
by
being
close.
one
of
the
candidates
was
white,
in
the
previous
year,
he
had
sent
out
a
mailing
for
a
biracial
voter
registration
activity.
it
was
this
philosophy
that
the
dcrg,
which
runs
dallas
county
politics
concluded,
was
the
most
effective
way
to
appeal
to
the
voters
of
dallas
county
and
it
was
quite
effective.
the
other
two
they
used,
they
simply
used
a
picture
of
the
black
candidate,
contrasted
with
his
white
opponent.
it
was
quite
effective
as
i
say
in
the
black
precinct
of
dallas,
these
candidates,
white
and
black
got
90%
and
87%
of
the
vote.
they
were
obliterated
in
the
white
precincts
and
were
defeated
very
sizably.
now,
that's
the
reality,
the
political
reality
this
record
establishes,
as
we
say
if
the
black
minority
of
dallas
county
establishes
--
it
fostered
as
we
see
it
by
other
factors.
the
massive
size
of
the
legislative
district
is
such,
there
is
simply
no
way
that
a
candidate
can
address
himself
to
that
electoral
without
enormous
finance,
the
record
rangers
estimates
to
run
a
state
legislative
rates
from
anywhere
from
$60,000
to
a
$125,000.
this
means
that
only
if
a
candidate
has
that
kind
of
finance,
could
he
ever
even
expect
to
receive
individualized
consideration
in
the
rate
as
a
legislative
candidate.
the
affect
of
it
has
been
to
really
prevent
the
emergence
of
a
two-party
system
in
texas.
the
record,
although
it
maybe
a
little
shocking,
but
that's
what
the
record
is.
but
the
republican
party
in
dallas
has
been
unable
and
unwilling
to
mount
serious
legislative
races
in
november,
simply
because
the
financing
is
beyond
their
means.
so,
what
we
have
is
again,
a
one-party
system,
terminations
being
made
in
the
democratic
primary
and
a
majority
place
system
and
a
primary
that
continues
to
be
dominated
by
a
white
alagarky
that
has
not
permitted
black
participation.
mr.
david
r.
richards
deviation,
just
straight
deviation.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
deviation
of
the
two
major
districts,
harris
and
baxar
was
not
sinful
to
the
court's
decision
on
deviation
if
i
make
myself
clear.
the
way
the
deviation
was
calculated
in
those
two
counties
was
simply
the
binding
number
of
legislators
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
some
parts
were,
but
not
those
parts
dealing
with
the
multimember,
single-member
district
issue.
some
parts
of
the
plan,
i
don't
think
is
purely
deviation.
i
think
--
if
i
read
the
court's
opinion
correctly,
what
we
have
is
the
state's
sponsor
and
explanation,
a
county
line
explanation
is
being
the
justifications
of
deviation,
but
once
you
go
behind
that
explanation
and
look
to
the
plan,
you
think
it
just
don't
make
sense.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
it
was,
indeed
there
are
two
strings
to
that
i
suppose,
the
irrational
that
why
could
harris
leave
dallas
and
bexar
at-large
with
no
appropriate
reason.
two,
the
effect
to
that
is
the
leaving
of
those
two
at-large
was
to
minimize,
dilute
or
press
the
minority
voting.
those
two
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
and
that's
i
suppose
a
shortcoming
on
the
part
of
plaintiffs.
this
case
was
tried
in
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
there
was
no
evidence
offered
a
findings
made
with
respect
to
racial
impact
as
regards
the
other
multimember
districts
in
the
state
and
the
reason
was
and
it
is
in
record
of
this
case
was
put
together
in
trial
number,
compressed
period
of
time
and
we
stated
very
frankly
to
the
court,
we
are
not
conceding
are
like
legitimacy
of
the
others,
but
we
simply
could
not
muster
the
proof
in
a
time
frame
in
which
will
operate.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
they
didn't
do
that
and
they
didn't
--
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
fair
construction
of
the
opinion.
i
suppose
they
would
have
--
no,
i
suppose
they
truly
would
have
any
of
the
evidence
came
forward
in
terms
of
racial
or
ethic
discrimination,
quite
clearly
yes,
they
would
have
considered.
whether
they
would
have
in
absence
of
such
evidence
or
findings
implemented
single-member
districts,
i
can't
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
right
and
we
might
have
believed
--
it
all
can,
i
suppose
we
would
be
back
to
the
court
saying,
you
want
to
cut
the
rest
of
them
all,
i
know
we
are
not
dishonest
with
the
court,
but
they
didn't
do
it,
the
contentions
weren't
there
and
how
they
would
react
if
and
when
we
have
to,
we
were
back
in
court
making
that
contention
i
can't
tell
you.
but
there
is
--
at
least
let
me
say,
that
there
is
a
difference
in
my
mind
between
a
multimember
district
that
let's
--
of
a
county
of
a
150,000
elects
in
two
legislators
and
a
multimember
district
of
a
million
for
electing
18,
simply
in
the
capacity
to
isolate
the
minority
then
this
inertia
alone
is
a
force
it
seems
to
me
when
it
comes
that
size.
mr.
david
r.
richards
23.
mr.
david
r.
richards
11,
dallas,
18.
mr.
david
r.
richards
and
one
of
the
ideas,
i
guess
in
the
plan
was
that
in
bexar
county,
one
of
those
candidates
may
have
at-large
and
presumably
all
operating
pursuant
to
state
policy
of
preserving
county
lands,
probably
the
board
for
some
reason
cut
a
piece
out
of
bexar
county,
attached
it
to
a
rural
district
for
no
reason
that
this
record
will
explain,
it
were
from
the
deviation
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
would
have
been
resulted,
had
have
been
left
intact
and
i
suppose
it
was
whimsical
things
of
this
nature
which
caused
the
--
capricious,
i
suppose
is
a
better
word,
caused
i
mean
the
lower
court
defined
that
there
were
simply
no
rational
purpose
underlying
this
plan,
clearly
no
rational
purpose
as
far
as
the
at-large
representation
in
the
urban
counties
or
stated
the
other
way,
the
at-large
representation
in
the
urban
counties,
in
no
way
fostered
a
state
purpose
that
was
urban
county
lands,
indeed
of
the
eleven
counties
in
which
they
were
left
in
large,
eight
of
them
were
actually
cut
their
county
lands
and
portions
of
the
county
removed
and
allocated
to
other
districts.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
court
below
did
not
think
so,
refuse
to
find
some
although
that
intension
was
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
there
is
an
dictum
in
at
least
certain
opinions
of
this
court
suggesting
that
if
the
plan
diluted
as
i
have
called
racial
or
political
minorities
that
it
might
be
inbounded
on
the
protection
policies,
if
not
so
held
as
i
understand.
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
there
were
historical
exclusions
in
catholics
from
a
franchise
and
from
every
aspect
of
life
in
that
committee
i
would
say
?
i
would
just
like
so.
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
are
not
here
arguing
that,
we
are
not
here
arguing,
i
don?t
mean
suggest
that
we
are
that
only
blacks
can
represent
blacks
and
only
catholics
can
represent
catholics
or
that
there
is
an
entitlement
to
a
representation
of
a
sort
of
vertical
of
somewhat
of
my
like
kind.
it
would
simply
arguing
that
this
system
on
this
record
establishes
the
kind
of
dilution
that
this
court
said
it
would
invalidate
when
it's
solved.
mr.
david
r.
richards
conceivably
it
provides
the
dignity
of
the
constitutional
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
don?t
think
such
concentrations
certainly
do
exist.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
guess
i
have
not
seen
--
i
have
seen
none
and
i
simply
see
that
i
don't
have
to
carry
that
burden,
i
think
in
this
period.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
because
we
are
dealing
--
at
least
we
feel
we
are
dealing
with
a
precise
minority
that
comes
in
a
context
that
we
think
demonstrates
how
it
can
be
submerged
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
and
i
think
--
and
texas
identified
that
minority
by
statutes,
by
its
practices
and
policies
for
a
number
of
years
and
it's
just
finally
beginning
to
see
so
that
if
--
having
identify
the
minority,
i
suppose
they
are
stuck
with
it.
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
you
mean
your
honor
--
well,
if
you
mean,
the
record
which
shows
that
in
1956
there
is
testimony
that
black
voters
presented
themselves
and
propose
in
a
democratic
primary
in
dallas
until
they
could
not
vote
there.
i
would
not
suggest
to
you
however
that
that
has
been
the
case.
i
think
the
case
has
been
--
the
poll
tax,
the
case
has
been
the
substitution
for
poll
tax,
the
angle
registration
system.
i
think
the
record
will
show
other
factors
which
in
fact
did
detour
black
voting.
now,
i
think
the
poll
tax
being
the
most
clearest
--
the
clearest
one
in
that
case.
but
physical
intimidation,
we
did
not
argue
the
physical
intimidation
of
black
voters.
mr.
david
r.
richards
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
simply
not
informed
that
it
has
been
--
i
am
not
informed.
i
am
sorry
sir,
but
this
bring
out
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
am
sorry,
if
i
said
it
in
that
way,
i
guess
i
meant
--
in
voting
i
don't
know,
i
meant
racial
discrimination,
blacks
in
dallas
were
segregated
by
law,
well
into
the
night,
the
decade
or
the
60s
or
the
50s,
and
by
practicing
of
the
60s.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
to
you
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
participated
in
stand
in
dallas
in
the
mid
1960s.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
i
guess
the
policy,
but
we
still
had
segregation
in
the
jail,
we
had
segregation
in
the
dallas
county
jail
as
recently
as
three
or
four
years
ago.
the
record
will
show
there's
still
black
and
white
drinking
fountains
in
the
county
courthouse
up
until
four
years
ago.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
thank
you.
mr.
david
r.
richards
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice.
we
--
let
me
open
with
the
brief
luminary
we
are
dividing
our
45
minutes
between
three
counsel,
i
would
attempt
to
open
to
discuss
the
what
we
consider
to
be
the
underlying
irrationality
of
the
state
plan
and
the
dilution
of
the
negroes
voter
vote
in
dallas
county.
mr.
idar
will
follow
discussing
the
underlying
distinctions
we
think
on
this
record
between
whitcomb
v.
chavis
and
the
impact
of
the
at-large
scheme
on
the
mexican
american
minority
of
bexar
county.
mr.
gee
on
behalf
of
state
republican
party
will
follow
to
discuss
what
everything
we
forget
including
jurisdiction
and
i
think
the
inordinate
costs
of
election
campaigns
in
the
county
which
would
suggestive.
as
a
preliminary
matter
the
order
below
is
a
first,
it?s
a
complicated
four
part,
four
law
suits
consolidating
with
various
contentions
i
guess
the
order
below
is
of
two
parts.
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
which
does
feed
to
the
statewide
apportionment
plan
but
that
was
not
effectuated
by
injunction
but
rather
it
was
left
to
be
operative
only
in
july
of
this
year
and
the
event
the
legislature
did
not
address
themselves
to
it.
there
was
injunctive
relief
it
was
narrow.
it
effected
only
two
counties
and
the
state
of
texas
those
counties
of
dallas
and
bexar
their
single
member
district
plans
were
implemented
by
the
court
unanimously
judge
wood
who
have
did
descent
from
the
other
portions
for
the
court's
opinion
below
agreed
that
this
was
so
egregious
in
dallas
and
bexar
county
that
implementation
of
immediate
single
member
districts
was
in
order.
so
we
think
the
jurisdictional
issue
is
in
the
case
mr.
gee
will
address
himself
to
it.
the
route
problem
that
confronted
the
texas
legislature
when
it
or
readily
redistricting
board
when
it
began
to
consider
the
reapportionment
to
the
texas
legislature
was
what
to
do
with
the
urban
counties.
the
testimony
is
clear
that
this
was
in
words
of
one
witness
enraging
controversy
across
state
of
texas.
hearings
were
held
by
the
legislative
redistricting
board
on
two
occasions
concerning
what
was
to
be
done
all
of
the
witnesses
who
appeared
were
concerned
only
with
this
single
issue.
urban
counties
of
dallas,
bexar
and
harris
whether
to
be
divided
into
individual
districts
or
something
last
then
at
large
are
worthy
to
left
at
large.
now
the
board
and
what
is
remains
and
orderly
unarticulated
decisions
decided
to
divide
harris
county
in
the
23
individual
member
districts
and
to
leave
and
dallas
and
bexar
county
running
at
large
dallas
has
become
what
we
all
saying
recognized
to
be
the
largest
legislative
districts
in
the
nations
history.
18
legislators
elected
from
at-large
of
one
million
four
hundred
thousand
people.
no
requirement
of
geographic
distribution
they
could
all
come
from
one
city
block
with
in
the
city
of
dallas.
now
the
peculiarity
here
quite
granted
there
was
a
history
of
at-large
representation
in
the
urban
cities
of
texas.
it
was
true
of
all
the
cities
of
texas
until
1965
when
the
texas
legislature
did
for
the
first
time
a
portion
harris
county,
huston
into
something
less
than
the
county
wide
districts
at
that
time
in
kilgarlin
v.
martin
the
state
of
texas
explained
to
the
federal
courts
that
a
policy
existed
and
that
policy
was
at
anytime
a
county
became
a
one
million
in
size,
or
more
than
15
legislators,
it
became
simply
unworkable
to
run
at-large
and
that
in
the
future,
then
anytime
a
county
became
that
size,
that
county
itself
would
be
a
portion
down
in
something
less
than
at-large
representation.
well,
then
dallas
county
hit
a
million
for
this
year,
larger
than
harris
was
an
65.
that
policy
went
by
the
board
without
even
whisper
on
the
part
of
the
board
members.
of
this
legislative
redistricting
board,
three
of
them
had
been
defendants
in
the
kilgarlin
case
who
presumably
had
the
sparse
of
that
explanation
for
the
--
at
that
time
for
the
apportionment
of
harris
county.
at
no
time,
although
now
in
their
reply
brief,
the
court
--
the
appellant
say
that
that
really
never
was
a
policy.
they
certainly
never
told
the
court
that,
the
court's
opinion
it
was
a
policy.
when
the
appeal
papers
were
filed
here,
there's
no
indication
of
any
disclaimer
of
that
policy
when
the
kilgarlin
v.
martin
was
considered
here
as
kilgarlin
v.
hill.
the
only
reason
that
appears
ever
for
this
rather
curious
treatment
of
the
two
counties
was
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed
by
the
appellants
and
they
suggested
there
that
the
reason
they
left
dallas
county
at-large
was
the
dominant
democratic
organization
dallas
county
preferred
to
take
when
they
will
take
all
election.
they
have
not
sponsored
that
as
their
reason
in
their
subsequent
briefs.
we
talked
about
the
board
procedures
in
our
briefs
and
we
did
deal
with
it,
not
because
we
want
to
go
behind
the
board
or
not
because
they
want
to
indite
what
they
did
because
they
did
it
on
a
sloppy
manner
but
because
it
points
to
no
rational
state
policy
that
underlies
this
very
crucial
decision
in
terms
of
how
people
are
going
to
be
elected
in
a
county,
the
size
of
dallas.
500,000
registered
voters
in
that
county
to
which
any
person
who
seeks
to
be
elected
to
the
legislature
must
somehow
communicate.
the
last
general
primary
election
in
dallas
had
68
races
on
it,
3+
congressional
seats,
3+
state
senate
seats
and
a
submerged
15
member
legislative
delegation.
results
of
this
rather
whims
or
goal
if
you
will,
if
not
penal
decision
with
respect
to
dallas
of
course
is
to
isolate
the
black
minority
of
that
city
which
has
suffered
a
traditional
isolation
that
this
record
speaks
to
quite
strongly
and
just
simply
and
intolerable
bind,
there
is
no
relief.
texas
remains
a
one-party
state,
this
is
not
a
situation
such
as
indiana
in
which
conceivably
the
explanation
for
the
under-representation
of
the
ghetto
was
winning
and
losing
elections
in
november.
what
happens
in
texas
is,
you
win
or
lose
in
a
democratic
primary,
the
democratic
primary
is
a
majority
place
system
that
means
and
order
to
obtain
the
nomination,
you
must
--
if
you
are
a
black
candidate,
ultimately
be
pitted
vis-a-v
a
white
candidate,
in
a
county
in
which
racial
segregation,
discrimination
has
still
been
the
order
of
the
day,
granted
it
diminishes,
but
as
this
record
establishes,
it
diminishes
rather
slowly.
what
this
record
further
shows
is
that
the
dominant
political
organization
of
that
county,
the
dcrg,
when
circumstances
require
and
their
candidates
are
threatened
by
a
black
candidate
or
by
a
candidate
that
has
the
support
of
the
negro
minority,
they
simply
try
out
the
old
game
of
race
in
order
to
win.
in
1970,
two
candidates
made
it
into
the
run-off,
democratic
primary
run-off
against
the
dcrg
candidates,
the
dcrg
being
a
private
sort
of
modern
day
chambered
association,
of
course
we
are
concerned.
in
that
run-off,
the
dcrg
mailed
to
some
--
the
white
voters
of
dallas
county,
literature
saying
?black
voting
tactics
will
take
place
in
the
south
dallas,
the
negro
area
of
dallas.
if
you
don't
get
out
to
propose
him
vote,?
and
it
said
the
philosophy
of
these
candidates
is
best
described
by
being
close.
one
of
the
candidates
was
white,
in
the
previous
year,
he
had
sent
out
a
mailing
for
a
biracial
voter
registration
activity.
it
was
this
philosophy
that
the
dcrg,
which
runs
dallas
county
politics
concluded,
was
the
most
effective
way
to
appeal
to
the
voters
of
dallas
county
and
it
was
quite
effective.
the
other
two
they
used,
they
simply
used
a
picture
of
the
black
candidate,
contrasted
with
his
white
opponent.
it
was
quite
effective
as
i
say
in
the
black
precinct
of
dallas,
these
candidates,
white
and
black
got
90%
and
87%
of
the
vote.
they
were
obliterated
in
the
white
precincts
and
were
defeated
very
sizably.
now,
that's
the
reality,
the
political
reality
this
record
establishes,
as
we
say
if
the
black
minority
of
dallas
county
establishes
--
it
fostered
as
we
see
it
by
other
factors.
the
massive
size
of
the
legislative
district
is
such,
there
is
simply
no
way
that
a
candidate
can
address
himself
to
that
electoral
without
enormous
finance,
the
record
rangers
estimates
to
run
a
state
legislative
rates
from
anywhere
from
$60,000
to
a
$125,000.
this
means
that
only
if
a
candidate
has
that
kind
of
finance,
could
he
ever
even
expect
to
receive
individualized
consideration
in
the
rate
as
a
legislative
candidate.
the
affect
of
it
has
been
to
really
prevent
the
emergence
of
a
two-party
system
in
texas.
the
record,
although
it
maybe
a
little
shocking,
but
that's
what
the
record
is.
but
the
republican
party
in
dallas
has
been
unable
and
unwilling
to
mount
serious
legislative
races
in
november,
simply
because
the
financing
is
beyond
their
means.
so,
what
we
have
is
again,
a
one-party
system,
terminations
being
made
in
the
democratic
primary
and
a
majority
place
system
and
a
primary
that
continues
to
be
dominated
by
a
white
alagarky
that
has
not
permitted
black
participation.
mr.
david
r.
richards
deviation,
just
straight
deviation.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
deviation
of
the
two
major
districts,
harris
and
baxar
was
not
sinful
to
the
court's
decision
on
deviation
if
i
make
myself
clear.
the
way
the
deviation
was
calculated
in
those
two
counties
was
simply
the
binding
number
of
legislators
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
some
parts
were,
but
not
those
parts
dealing
with
the
multimember,
single-member
district
issue.
some
parts
of
the
plan,
i
don't
think
is
purely
deviation.
i
think
--
if
i
read
the
court's
opinion
correctly,
what
we
have
is
the
state's
sponsor
and
explanation,
a
county
line
explanation
is
being
the
justifications
of
deviation,
but
once
you
go
behind
that
explanation
and
look
to
the
plan,
you
think
it
just
don't
make
sense.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
it
was,
indeed
there
are
two
strings
to
that
i
suppose,
the
irrational
that
why
could
harris
leave
dallas
and
bexar
at-large
with
no
appropriate
reason.
two,
the
effect
to
that
is
the
leaving
of
those
two
at-large
was
to
minimize,
dilute
or
press
the
minority
voting.
those
two
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
and
that's
i
suppose
a
shortcoming
on
the
part
of
plaintiffs.
this
case
was
tried
in
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
there
was
no
evidence
offered
a
findings
made
with
respect
to
racial
impact
as
regards
the
other
multimember
districts
in
the
state
and
the
reason
was
and
it
is
in
record
of
this
case
was
put
together
in
trial
number,
compressed
period
of
time
and
we
stated
very
frankly
to
the
court,
we
are
not
conceding
are
like
legitimacy
of
the
others,
but
we
simply
could
not
muster
the
proof
in
a
time
frame
in
which
will
operate.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
they
didn't
do
that
and
they
didn't
--
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
fair
construction
of
the
opinion.
i
suppose
they
would
have
--
no,
i
suppose
they
truly
would
have
any
of
the
evidence
came
forward
in
terms
of
racial
or
ethic
discrimination,
quite
clearly
yes,
they
would
have
considered.
whether
they
would
have
in
absence
of
such
evidence
or
findings
implemented
single-member
districts,
i
can't
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
right
and
we
might
have
believed
--
it
all
can,
i
suppose
we
would
be
back
to
the
court
saying,
you
want
to
cut
the
rest
of
them
all,
i
know
we
are
not
dishonest
with
the
court,
but
they
didn't
do
it,
the
contentions
weren't
there
and
how
they
would
react
if
and
when
we
have
to,
we
were
back
in
court
making
that
contention
i
can't
tell
you.
but
there
is
--
at
least
let
me
say,
that
there
is
a
difference
in
my
mind
between
a
multimember
district
that
let's
--
of
a
county
of
a
150,000
elects
in
two
legislators
and
a
multimember
district
of
a
million
for
electing
18,
simply
in
the
capacity
to
isolate
the
minority
then
this
inertia
alone
is
a
force
it
seems
to
me
when
it
comes
that
size.
mr.
david
r.
richards
23.
mr.
david
r.
richards
11,
dallas,
18.
mr.
david
r.
richards
and
one
of
the
ideas,
i
guess
in
the
plan
was
that
in
bexar
county,
one
of
those
candidates
may
have
at-large
and
presumably
all
operating
pursuant
to
state
policy
of
preserving
county
lands,
probably
the
board
for
some
reason
cut
a
piece
out
of
bexar
county,
attached
it
to
a
rural
district
for
no
reason
that
this
record
will
explain,
it
were
from
the
deviation
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
would
have
been
resulted,
had
have
been
left
intact
and
i
suppose
it
was
whimsical
things
of
this
nature
which
caused
the
--
capricious,
i
suppose
is
a
better
word,
caused
i
mean
the
lower
court
defined
that
there
were
simply
no
rational
purpose
underlying
this
plan,
clearly
no
rational
purpose
as
far
as
the
at-large
representation
in
the
urban
counties
or
stated
the
other
way,
the
at-large
representation
in
the
urban
counties,
in
no
way
fostered
a
state
purpose
that
was
urban
county
lands,
indeed
of
the
eleven
counties
in
which
they
were
left
in
large,
eight
of
them
were
actually
cut
their
county
lands
and
portions
of
the
county
removed
and
allocated
to
other
districts.
mr.
david

richards
the
court
below
did
not
think
so,
refuse
to
find
some
although
that
intension
was
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
there
is
an
dictum
in
at
least
certain
opinions
of
this
court
suggesting
that
if
the
plan
diluted
as
i
have
called
racial
or
political
minorities
that
it
might
be
inbounded
on
the
protection
policies,
if
not
so
held
as
i
understand.
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
there
were
historical
exclusions
in
catholics
from
a
franchise
and
from
every
aspect
of
life
in
that
committee
i
would
say
?
i
would
just
like
so.
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
are
not
here
arguing
that,
we
are
not
here
arguing,
i
don?t
mean
suggest
that
we
are
that
only
blacks
can
represent
blacks
and
only
catholics
can
represent
catholics
or
that
there
is
an
entitlement
to
a
representation
of
a
sort
of
vertical
of
somewhat
of
my
like
kind.
it
would
simply
arguing
that
this
system
on
this
record
establishes
the
kind
of
dilution
that
this
court
said
it
would
invalidate
when
it's
solved.
mr.
david
r.
richards
conceivably
it
provides
the
dignity
of
the
constitutional
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
don?t
think
such
concentrations
certainly
do
exist.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
guess
i
have
not
seen
--
i
have
seen
none
and
i
simply
see
that
i
don't
have
to
carry
that
burden,
i
think
in
this
period.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
because
we
are
dealing
--
at
least
we
feel
we
are
dealing
with
a
precise
minority
that
comes
in
a
context
that
we
think
demonstrates
how
it
can
be
submerged
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
and
i
think
--
and
texas
identified
that
minority
by
statutes,
by
its
practices
and
policies
for
a
number
of
years
and
it's
just
finally
beginning
to
see
so
that
if
--
having
identify
the
minority,
i
suppose
they
are
stuck
with
it.
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
you
mean
your
honor
--
well,
if
you
mean,
the
record
which
shows
that
in
1956
there
is
testimony
that
black
voters
presented
themselves
and
propose
in
a
democratic
primary
in
dallas
until
they
could
not
vote
there.
i
would
not
suggest
to
you
however
that
that
has
been
the
case.
i
think
the
case
has
been
--
the
poll
tax,
the
case
has
been
the
substitution
for
poll
tax,
the
angle
registration
system.
i
think
the
record
will
show
other
factors
which
in
fact
did
detour
black
voting.
now,
i
think
the
poll
tax
being
the
most
clearest
--
the
clearest
one
in
that
case.
but
physical
intimidation,
we
did
not
argue
the
physical
intimidation
of
black
voters.
mr.
david
r.
richards
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
simply
not
informed
that
it
has
been
--
i
am
not
informed.
i
am
sorry
sir,
but
this
bring
out
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
am
sorry,
if
i
said
it
in
that
way,
i
guess
i
meant
--
in
voting
i
don't
know,
i
meant
racial
discrimination,
blacks
in
dallas
were
segregated
by
law,
well
into
the
night,
the
decade
or
the
60s
or
the
50s,
and
by
practicing
of
the
60s.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
to
you
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
participated
in
stand
in
dallas
in
the
mid
1960s.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
i
guess
the
policy,
but
we
still
had
segregation
in
the
jail,
we
had
segregation
in
the
dallas
county
jail
as
recently
as
three
or
four
years
ago.
the
record
will
show
there's
still
black
and
white
drinking
fountains
in
the
county
courthouse
up
until
four
years
ago.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
thank
you.
