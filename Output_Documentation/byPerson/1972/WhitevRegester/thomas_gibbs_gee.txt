mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
correct
yourself
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
not
our
position,
our
position
is
that
any
minority
except
perhaps
a
political
ones
such
as
i
represent
is
entitled
not
to
have
the

structured
so
that
they
do
not
have
a
fair
opportunity
to

we
claim
no
right
to
any
special
preference.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
respond
very
briefly
to
a
question
which
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
of
colonel
jaworski,
as
regard
to
the
state
policy,
the
trail
court
noted
at
page
21a
of
the
appendix
that
jurisdictional
statement,
in
there
a
trial
brief
the
state
asserted,
this
is
the
trial
brief,
may
it
please
your
honor
in
the
kilgarlin
case
and
their
trial
brief
state
asserted
that
the
explanation
to
the
different
treatment
of
dallas
and
harris
counties
was
that
whenever
the
county
attained
a
million
resonant,
it
was
allocated
15
legislatures
and
so.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
one
other
suggestion
made
by
colonel
jaworski
and
that
is
that
dallas
was
mulitimembered
because
of
the
desires
of
the
citizens
there.
this
record
makes
in
amply
clear,
that
the
desires
of
the
citizens
there
taken
by
professional
and
disinterested
pole
hich
testimony
was
before
the
redistricting
court
where
two
or
three
to
one
in
favor
of
single
member
district
and
that
in
fact
of
the
desires
of
the
people
in
dallas
were
not
at
all
for
the
multimember
point.
the
court
will
find
that
in
the
record,
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
robertson
at
page
964
of
the
record.
now
it
falls
to
me,
may
it
please
the
court
to
attempt
a
handle
in
very
short
time
and
quite
a
few
sayings
and
i
am
going
to
attempt
to
moving
on
rather
quickly.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
i
intent
to
say
word
on
that
and
i
will
commit.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
customarily
mr.
justice
white
it
does,
i
will
attempt
to
deal
with
that
right
now,
and
in
the
past
this
court
has
word
shortly
is
the
expert
on
its
own
jurisdiction.
this
matter
has
held
at
the
three
judge
court
as
in
moody
v.
flowers
or
in
the
new
last
case
must
be
properly
constituted
but
i
pleading
asking
for
an
injunction
having
state
wide
influence.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
no,
not
at
all,
not
at
all
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
mr.
justice
white
in
the
gunn
case.
in
the
gunn
case
this
court
held
where
the
injunction
was
not
evidence,
even
though
the
three-judge
court
was
properly
constituted
that
this
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
now,
it
is
only
step
from
that
to
a
holding
that
the
court's
jurisdiction
is
not
appropriate
in
this
case
where
an
injunction
which
is
now,
which
applies
only
two
counties
in
texas.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
no
sir,
we
have
no
authority
whatsoever
but
i
suggest
that
by
melding
of
what
the
court
has
held
in
the
moody
and
in
(inaudible)
with
his
decision
in
gunn.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
i
am
aware
of
that
your
honor
however
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
to
the
court
to
find
--
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
of
the
injunction
which
applies
to
dallas
county
and
bexar
county
mr.
justice
white
i
should
say.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
i
would
not
wish
to
say
that
the
court's
penalty
jurisdiction
would
not
extend
in
there
mr.
justice
white.
i
will
say
this
however,
if
the
court
intents
to
hold
that
now
that
the
procedure
device
of
a
alleging
a
claim
for
state
wide
relief
wide
relief
and
perhaps
contending
for
only
narrow
injunctive
relief.
a
complainant
can
place
jurisdiction
in
this
court
whether
it
will
nor
not.
then
the
court's
jurisdiction
likely
to
be
widely
extend.
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
relief
sort
here
had
been
in
dallas
and
bexar
counties
and
release,
the
relief
sort
had
been
granted
then
we
would
have
precisely
the
swann
case
as
regards
the
practicalities
of
the
matter
at
this
point.
it
is
not
the
seeking
of
relief
having
state
wide
impact
which
calls
for
immediate
review
by
this
court;
it
is
the
granting
of
it
and
the
disruption
of
the
states
process
which
is
incidental
too.
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
dallas
county,
time
is
very
short
but
if
it
is
been
said
that
the
court
has
long
been
troubled,
it
seems
to
me
by
the
tendency
to
submerge
minorities
which
is
inherent
in
the
size
of
multi-member
district.
connor
v.
johnson
notes
that
the
several
member
districts
is
the
preferable
model
and
whitcomb
against
chavis,
the
same
note
is
made
and
even
earlier
in
the
lucas
case
way
back
in
1964.
the
court
realizes
that
the
larger
the
district
gets
the
more
invidious,
its
effect
are.
now
here
we
deal
with
the
largest
districts
known
to
exist
in
the
entire
country
and
as
dallas
is
number
one,
may
it
please
the
court
bexar
county
is
number
two.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
heaven
knows
what
it
is
now,
dallas
had
1,327,000
and
5,00,000
registered
voters.
dallas
was
larger
in
population
than
15
states.
30
united
states
senators
are
elected
from
constituencies
which
are
smaller
than
that
to
which
miami
wants
to
set
in
the
texas
house
of
representatives
from
dallas,
texas
after
run.
now
i
submit
that
this
situation
is
toggle,
it
might
have
been
otherwise
this
is
not
the
case
as
a
great
wide
open
space
is
of
west
texas
where
you
have
to
take
in
a
great
deal
of
land
in
order
to
get
an
ideal
district.
this
is
something
which
could
have
been
and
should
have
been
otherwise
and
would
have
been
but
for
the
board
and
it
plan.
bexar
county
as
describe
by
(inaudible)
is
much
smaller,
it
is
smaller
it's
not
quite
a
million
people.
it's
larger
than
rhode
island,
8,
30,460
people.
this
is
still
a
bracket
which
is
fair
sized
i
submit.
well,
if
this
district,
may
it
please
the
court,
for
instance
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
muster
then
any
will,
any
in
the
country
and
the
courts
concern
with
multimember
districts
with
the
size
of
districts
is
over
until
dallas
reaches
two
million
or
three
million
or
whatever
within
a
short
period
of
time.
if
such
a
district,
as
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
record
shows
that
although
the
state
law
forbids
it,
the
voters
had
to
take
cheatsheets
with
them
to
the
poll
even
to
remember
who
is
what
that
they
wanted
to
vote.
it
shows
that
you
can?t
get
the
number
of
candidates
who
are
on
the
ballot
on
the
standard
voting
machine,
there
is
not
enough
room.
it
shows
that
even
the
chairman
of
the
dcrg,
the
dominant
political
sub
party
in
dallas
when
he
was
asked
before
legislative
committee
to
name
the
15
democratic
legislators
from
dallas
county,
he
was
able
to
name
only
and
that
appears
on
the
record
as
well.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would.
i
would
because
houston,
which
is
200
miles
down
the
pike,
has
got,
if
i
want
to
run
for
the
legislature
and
huston
i
can
run
to
75,000
people.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
i
do,
i
think
it
would
be
very
bad
policy
to
have
district
of
that
size,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
the
desperate
treatment,
the
selection
of
different
systems
that
represented
the
government
in
texas
which
raises
the
equal
protection
question.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
that?s
very
clear
sir.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
well,
between
74,000
and
75,000
people
mr.
chief
justice
that?s
all
we
can
do.
now
there
is
?
the
chief
justice
referred
to
the
multimembered
district?
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
mr.
chief
justice
i
don?t
know
what
it
would
be
but
i
am
satisfied
that
it
is
actually
less
than
an
million
and
half.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
out
of
all
reason;
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
under
the
chief
justice,
and
the
opinion
written
by
the
chief
justice
in
bullock
v.
carter.
we
have
in
raymond,
the
(inaudible)
against
the
court
or
under
such
instance
in
this
record
shows
that
you
can
not
run
it
effectively
in
the
district
the
size
of
dallas
without
going
to
television
and
radio
and
that
in
huston
you
can,
you
can
campaign
on
posters
and
so
on.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
certainly
have
and
if
i
will
answer
your
question
that
i
was
not
--
i
beg
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pardon.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
yes.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
yes
i
am
sir.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
in
spite
of
whitcomb
v.
chavis
and
because
of
bullock
v.
carter
mr.
justice
white.
now
i
would
like
to
say
one
last
word
on
the
subject
of
the
mahan
v.
howell
which
was
just
been
handed
down
and
in
which
i
think
no
argument
on
this
dictum
in
this
regard.
in
virginia
a
16%
variation
was
upheld
by
this
court
because
virginia
had
decided
to
let
these
counties
pass
its
legislature
pass
local
legislature
as
i
understand
the
courts
opinion.
i
would
like
to
point
out
then
under
the
texas
constitution
the
legislature
not
only
is
not
authorized
to
pay
us
local
legislation
under
texas
constitution,
the
legislature
is
specifically
forbidden
by
local
legislation.
article
3,
section
56,
the
texas
constitution
state,
the
legislature
shall
not
except
as
otherwise
is
provided
in
this
constitution
pass
any
local
or
special
law
authorizing
regulating
the
further
counties,
cities,
town,
board
or
school
districts
locating
or
changing
county
seats
in
cooperated
city,
towns
and
so
forth
creating
offices
or
describing
the
powers
and
duties
of
offices.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
they
aren?t
in
some
instances
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
call
this
back
at
legislation
and
this
is
the
main
whereby
the
legislature
attempts
to
get
around
this
provision.
now,
some
times
they
are
at
the
brackets
are
broad
enough
and
whole
legislation
was
closed
brackets
which
says
settings
on
so
and
so
population
in
generally
not
substantive.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
valid
distinction
between
mahan
v.
howell
if
county
legislation
was
done
by
the
texas
legislature,
it
is
certainly
done
in
the
dark
at
the
moment
and
it
is
frequently
invalidated
by
the
texas
supreme
court.
further
texas,
now
unlike
virginia
as
i
indicated
by
the
courts
opinion
has
not
consistently
fallowed
the
state
policy
of
respecting
county
line.
in
smith
v.
craddick
the
texas
supreme
court
felt
them
strain
to
invalidate
a
legislature
plan
enacted
by
the
texas
legislature
or
which
disregard
county
and
it
has
not,
may
it
please
the
court
done
so
in
this
case
where
19
counties
are
could,
i
am
confused
by
the
reoccurring
statement
that
only
one
county
is
divided.
the
record
is
clear
that
19
counties.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
out
of
254
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
19
counties
have
been
got
and
four
them
have
been
exploded,
cut
into
three
pieces
in
the
defiance
of
the
texas
supreme
court
mandate
the
in
smith
v.
craddick.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
224
obviously
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
i
think
that?s
what
it
must
be,
or
it
sometimes
described
in
the
brief
as
as
rural
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
correct
yourself
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
not
our
position,
our
position
is
that
any
minority

may
it

the
court,
i

was

jurisdiction
likely
to
be
widely
extend.
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
relief
sort
here
had
been
in
dallas
and
bexar
counties
and
release,
the
relief
sort
had
been
granted
then
we
would
have
precisely
the
swann
case
as
regards
the
practicalities
of
the
matter
at
this
point.
it
is
not
the
seeking
of
relief
having
state
wide
impact
which
calls
for
immediate
review
by
this
court;
it
is
the
granting
of
it
and
the
disruption
of
the
states
process
which
is
incidental
too.
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
dallas
county,
time
is
very
short
but
if
it
is
been
said
that
the
court
has
long
been
troubled,
it
seems
to
me
by
the
tendency
to
submerge
minorities
which
is
inherent
in
the
size
of
multi-member
district.
connor
v.
johnson
notes
that
the
several
member
districts
is
the
preferable
model
and
whitcomb
against
chavis,
the
same
note
is
made
and
even
earlier
in
the
lucas
case
way
back
in
1964.
the
court
realizes
that
the
larger
the
district
gets
the
more
invidious,
its
effect
are.
now
here
we
deal
with
the
largest
districts
known
to
exist
in
the
entire
country
and
as
dallas
is
number
one,
may
it
please
the
court
bexar
county
is
number
two.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
heaven
knows
what
it
is
now,
dallas
had
1,327,000
and
5,00,000
registered
voters.
dallas
was
larger
in
population
than
15
states.
30
united
states
senators
are
elected
from
constituencies
which
are
smaller
than
that
to
which
miami
wants
to
set
in
the
texas
house
of
representatives
from
dallas,
texas
after
run.
now
i
submit
that
this
situation
is
toggle,
it
might
have
been
otherwise
this
is
not
the
case
as
a
great
wide
open
space
is
of
west
texas
where
you
have
to
take
in
a
great
deal
of
land
in
order
to
get
an
ideal
district.
this
is
something
which
could
have
been
and
should
have
been
otherwise
and
would
have
been
but
for
the
board
and
it
plan.
bexar
county
as
describe
by
(inaudible)
is
much
smaller,
it
is
smaller
it's
not
quite
a
million
people.
it's
larger
than
rhode
island,
8,
30,460
people.
this
is
still
a
bracket
which
is
fair
sized
i
submit.
well,
if
this
district,
may
it
please
the
court,
for
instance
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
muster
then
any
will,
any
in
the
country
and
the
courts
concern
with
multimember
districts
with
the
size
of
districts
is
over
until
dallas
reaches
two
million
or
three
million
or
whatever
within
a
short
period
of
time.
if
such
a
district,
as
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
record
shows
that
although
the
state
law
forbids
it,
the
voters
had
to
take
cheatsheets
with
them
to
the
poll
even
to
remember
who
is
what
that
they
wanted
to
vote.
it
shows
that
you
can?t
get
the
number
of
candidates
who
are
on
the
ballot
on
the
standard
voting
machine,
there
is
not
enough
room.
it
shows
that
even
the
chairman
of
the
dcrg,
the
dominant
political
sub
party
in
dallas
when
he
was
asked
before
legislative
committee
to
name
the
15
democratic
legislators
from
dallas
county,
he
was
able
to
name
only
and
that
appears
on
the
record
as
well.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would.
i
would
because
houston,
which
is
200
miles
down
the
pike,
has
got,
if
i
want
to
run
for
the
legislature
and
huston
i
can
run
to
75,000
people.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
i
do,
i
think
it
would
be
very
bad
policy
to
have
district
of
that
size,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
the
desperate
treatment,
the
selection
of
different
systems
that
represented
the
government
in
texas
which
raises
the
equal
protection
question.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
that?s
very
clear
sir.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
well,
between
74,000
and
75,000
people
mr.
chief
justice
that?s
all
we
can
do.
now
there
is
?
the
chief
justice
referred
to
the
multimembered
district?
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
mr.
chief
justice
i
don?t
know
what
it
would
be
but
i
am
satisfied
that
it
is
actually
less
than
an
million
and
half.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
out
of
all
reason;
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
under
the
chief
justice,
and
the
opinion
written
by
the
chief
justice
in
bullock
v.
carter.
we
have
in
raymond,
the
(inaudible)
against
the
court
or
under
such
instance
in
this
record
shows
that
you
can
not
run
it
effectively
in
the
district
the
size
of
dallas
without
going
to
television
and
radio
and
that
in
huston
you
can,
you
can
campaign
on
posters
and
so
on.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
certainly
have
and
if
i
will
answer
your
question
that
i
was
not
--
i
beg
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pardon.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
yes.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
yes
i
am
sir.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
in
spite
of
whitcomb
v.
chavis
and
because
of
bullock
v.
carter
mr.
justice
white.
now
i
would
like
to
say
one
last
word
on
the
subject
of
the
mahan
v.
howell
which
was
just
been
handed
down
and
in
which
i
think
no
argument
on
this
dictum
in
this
regard.
in
virginia
a
16%
variation
was
upheld
by
this
court
because
virginia
had
decided
to
let
these
counties
pass
its
legislature
pass
local
legislature
as
i
understand
the
courts
opinion.
i
would
like
to
point
out
then
under
the
texas
constitution
the
legislature
not
only
is
not
authorized
to
pay
us
local
legislation
under
texas
constitution,
the
legislature
is
specifically
forbidden
by
local
legislation.
article
3,
section
56,
the
texas
constitution
state,
the
legislature
shall
not
except
as
otherwise
is
provided
in
this
constitution
pass
any
local
or
special
law
authorizing
regulating
the
further
counties,
cities,
town,
board
or
school
districts
locating
or
changing
county
seats
in
cooperated
city,
towns
and
so
forth
creating
offices
or
describing
the
powers
and
duties
of
offices.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
they
aren?t
in
some
instances
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
call
this
back
at
legislation
and
this
is
the
main
whereby
the
legislature
attempts
to
get
around
this
provision.
now,
some
times
they
are
at
the
brackets
are
broad
enough
and
whole
legislation
was
closed
brackets
which
says
settings
on
so
and
so
population
in
generally
not
substantive.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
valid
distinction
between
mahan
v.
howell
if
county
legislation
was
done
by
the
texas
legislature,
it
is
certainly
done
in
the
dark
at
the
moment
and
it
is
frequently
invalidated
by
the
texas
supreme
court.
further
texas,
now
unlike
virginia
as
i
indicated
by
the
courts
opinion
has
not
consistently
fallowed
the
state
policy
of
respecting
county
line.
in
smith
v.
craddick
the
texas
supreme
court
felt
them
strain
to
invalidate
a
legislature
plan
enacted
by
the
texas
legislature
or
which
disregard
county
and
it
has
not,
may
it
please
the
court
done
so
in
this
case
where
19
counties
are
could,
i
am
confused
by
the
reoccurring
statement
that
only
one
county
is
divided.
the
record
is
clear
that
19
counties.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
out
of
254
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
19
counties
have
been
got
and
four
them
have
been
exploded,
cut
into
three
pieces
in
the
defiance
of
the
texas
supreme
court
mandate
the
in
smith
v.
craddick.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
224
obviously
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
gibbs
gee
i
think
that?s
what
it
must
be,
or
it
sometimes
described
in
the
brief
as
as
rural
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
