mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
pursuing
the
matter
that
has
just
been
raised
i
think
that
for
our
part
we
would
like
to
stress
that
we
conceive
the
right
to
vote
has
going
far
beyond
nearly
casting
a
ballot,
marking
it
in
custom
and
this
court
has
so
held
and
our
position
here
primarily
as
to
bexar
county
is
that
because
of
certain
statutes
in
texas.
our
minority
in
bexar
county
has
been
totally
submerged.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
lower
court
found
that
race
is
still
an
important
in
bexar
county
and
because
of
it
mexican
americans
were
frozen
into
permanent
political
minorities
destined
for
constant
defeat
of
the
hands
of
the
controlling
political
majority.
now,
i
will
emphasize
that
this
is
a
finding
made
by
three
judges
who
have
spent
their
entire
life
in
texas,
one
of
them
being
judge
wood
from
san
antonio.
now,
i
would
like
to
stress
on
the
multimember
district
issue
that
as
far
as
a
legislative
redistricting
board
where
he
initiated
his
work
on
the
house
redistricting
plan,
it
expressly
had
before
it
certain
cautionary
language
on
the
part
of
the
texas
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
mauzy
v.
the
legislative
redistricting
board
which
is
the
one
mandamus
the
board
to
redistrict
the
house.
the
texas
supreme
court
who
presumably
is
familiar
with
the
democracy
of
our
state,
of
our
municipalities,
our
metropolitan
areas
of
the
distribution
and
concentration
of
the
minority
groups
expressly
stated
as
follows.
in
exercising
its
discretions
as
to
whether
to
create
multimember
districts
within
a
single
county,
we
must
assume
that
the
board
will
give
careful
consideration
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
creation
of
any
particular
multimember
district
would
result
in
discrimination
by
minimizing
the
voting
strength
of
any
political
or
racial
elements
of
the
voting
population.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
is
on
the
record
that
from
1880
to
1970,
there
were
only
five
mexican
americans
have
been
elected
to
the
texas
house,
one
of
them
in
1890,
four
of
them
since
1961.
i
would
further
stress
that
between
1960
and
1970
and
this
is
part
of
the
record
and
it
is
un-controverted.
out
of
a
133
races
in
the
democratic
party
primaries,
only
22
were
entered
by
mexican
americans
and
of
course
as
i
already
have
stated,
only
four
were
actually
elected
during
that
period.
now,
from
the
particular
area
where
the
mexican
americans
concentrated
in
san
antonio,
which
is
on
the
record
as
28
contiguous
census
track
area,
only
four
candidates
win
from
that
area
between
1960
and
1970,
two
mexican
americans,
one
negro,
one
anglo-american.
now,
i
can
not
overstress
what
mr.
richards
touched
upon
and
that
is
the
size
of
the
multimember
districts
that
we
are
dealing
with.
bexar
county
830000
and
460000
population
the
city
of
san
antonio
654000
is
larger
than
seventeen
of
it
a
132
countries
in
the
united
nations.
it
is
larger
than
the
combine
population
of
four
of
those
countries.
it
is
larger
than
11
states
but
elect
22
united
states
senators.
it
has
an
land
area
larger
than
the
state
of
rhode
island.
now
1246
squared
miles,
it
is
larger
both
in
land
area
and
population
than
the
state
of
columbia.
four
senators
are
elected
from
states
that
have
a
total
population
less
than
bexar
county.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
they
don't
vote.
i
think
we
have
to
?
that?s
where
the
racial
history
of
our
state
counseling
to
play
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
stress
up.
since
1966
through
1972
we
have
had
6
federal
court
decisions
dealing
with
the
political,
with
the
electoral
system
in
texas,
five
of
those
between
1970
and
1972.
the
poll
tax
was
set
aside
in
1966
the
excessive
filing
fee
requirement
in
1970,
the
six
months
residency
requirement
1972.
the
over
increased
cities
and
small
town
in
south
texas
and
local
city
charter
provision
requiring
property
ownership
for
election
to
city
office
was
set
aside
by
a
single
judge
or
district
court.
in
the
case
archer
v.
smith
in
1971
the
certain
provisions
in
the
texas
electoral
court
denying
the
right
to
illiterate
voters
to
have
an
election
judge
help
to
mark
the
ballot
was
set
aside
on
the
grounds
that
that
seem
right
was
not
denied
to
blind
or
physically
disable
olds.
now
when
i
touch
upon
a
literacy
in
that
case,
i
must
point
out
that
persons
may
be
illiterate
in
english
or
not
necessarily
illiterate
persons
because
they
do
speak
and
read
spanish
and
they
do
follow
spanish
radio
and
television
and
they
do
have
the
means
at
hand
to
form
political
judgments.
we
have
had
in
addition
to
that,
since
1971
three
decisions
having
to
do
with
jury
service,
the
denial
of
opportunity
to
serve
on
juries
and
we
have
seeks
decisions
is
1970
dealing
with
education,
one
of
them
is
now
before
this
court
which
is
one
involving
the
rodriguez
case
in
the
independent
school
district
in
san
antonio
on
school
finance.
so,
in
reply
to
that
question
why
don't
we
vote,
we
need
to
assess
a
situation
of
the
mexican
american
actually
has
developed
in
the
history
of
this
country.
a
slate
1972
we
cannot
wipe
all
of
this
hindrances
and
then
overnight
inspect
the
injured
group
to
be
able
to
compete
on
an
equal
fooding
with
those
people
who
have
never
been
hindered
and
when
you
throw
them
into
the
type
of
multimember
district
county
that
we
have
where
they
have
to
compete
in
an
area
of
over
a
thousand
square
miles
or
they
have
to
appeal
to
an
electoral
that
is
close
to
a
million
voter
where
they
have
to
raise
a
finances
and
i
am
not
minimizing
the
fact
that
the
record
in
our
brief
make
some
profuse
references
to
economic,
educational,
in
any
number
4
to
5,
that
has
be
adverse
to
the
mexican
american
population.
we
cannot
equate
numbers
simply
with
the
denial
of
right.
i
think
in
minority
constitutionally
those
have
define
purely
on
the
basis
of
numbers.
so
my
position
is,
our
position
is
that
because
of
these
hindrances
true,
we
don't
hold
to
the
extent
that
other
people
(inaudible)
also
incidentally
i
forgot
to
mention
that
i
know
the
part
of
the
record
is
that
the
anglo
american
population
in
bexar
county
we
vote
on
a
ration
of
6:1
to
9:1
against
mexican
american
candidates.
i
might
further
pointing
out
that
i
said
result
for
the
single
member
district
that
were
in
post
on
the
counties
where
order
for
the
county
by
the
trail
court.
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried
out
of
10
representatives
on
bexar
county
to
the
state
legislature.
nine
were
anglo-american
and
none
was
black
or
negro
and
none
was
republican
and
only
one
was
mixed
mexican
and
anglo-american
parent.
today
as
a
result
of
last
year
selections
there
were
four
mexican-americans,
one
negro
and
two
republicans
in
dallas
county.
today
we
have
three
--
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
of
course
the
mexican-americans
and
the
black
or
negro
over
them
or
blacks.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
that
is
eleven.
that
would
make
a
democrats
i
am
sorry,
10
democrats
because
there
is
only
two
republicans
were
elected
--
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
one
black
or
negro
and
two
republicans.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
not
necessarily
because
we
have
recognized
that
a
single
member
district
is
no
millennium,
its
not
(inaudible).
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
in
some
of
them
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
--
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
being
the
once
or
no
mexican-americans
were
elected,
i
don't
know
that
we
had
any
mexican-americans
running
in
any
of
those
other
races.
i
do
not
believe
it
so
your
honor;
i
think
they
were
mostly
concentrated
in
those
districts
where
they
felt
they
had
an
opportunity
whether
or
not
they
had
a
substantial
majority
of
the
vote.
what
our
argument
here
is
not
that
we
feel
entitled
to
representation
as
such.
our
argument
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
participate
to
an
opportunity
to
compete.
not
to
be
counted
out
by
the
cost
of
running
an
election,
the
cost
of
campaigning,
the
area
in
which
we
have
to
campaign
by
the
attitude
of
the
people
or
the
opposition.
i
might
stress
a
fact
that
as
far
as
mexican-american
is
concerned,
there
is
no
need
to
circulate
campaign
literature
showing
what
it
looks
like
because
his
name
makes
it
put
a
self-evidence
on
the
ballot
and
you
don?t
want
to
vote
for
mexican-american,
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
the
name
on
the
ballot
and
you
do
not
have
to
read
resort
to
overt
methods
of
racial
methods
say
for
hiding
black
as
your
opponent.
i
would
like
to
make
preference
to
one
stipulation
that
was
referred
to
this
court
and
that
is
that
the
stipulation
is
on
record
that
nobody
has
been
denied
the
right
to
register
and
vote.
i
have
already
stressed
that
we
feel
the
right
to
vote
goes
far
beyond
just
to
right
to
register
and
vote,
but
i
would
like
to
stress
this
stipulation
relates
only
to
the
name
plaintiffs
in
the
law
suit.
now
we
are
not
making
and
we
are
not
hinging
our
case
on
denial
of
the
right
to
register
and
vote.
we
are
hinging
it
on
the
fact
that
we
have
been
submerged
totally
in
this
tremendous
multimember
district.
i
wanted
to
stress
the
distinction
between
this
district
and
virginia
in
the
mahan
case.
fairfax
county,
455000
population,
10
representatives
and
the
legislature
there
as
this
court
has
stated
in
its
opinion,
expressly
went
out
of
its
way,
not
to
fragmentally
but
so
simply
divided.
so
as
not
to
wind
up
with
too
large
a
multimember
district,
they
wind
up
with
two
fine
member
districts.
in
contrast
to
that,
we
have
bexar
county
with
830,000
population,
that?s
almost
twice
the
size
of
fairfax
county
and
with
that
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
and
allow
mr.
gee.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.

what
mr.

touched
upon

that

it
is

both
in

than

four
senators
are
elected
from
states
that
have
a
total
population
less
than
bexar
county.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
they
don't
vote.
i
think
we
have
to
?
that?s
where
the
racial
history
of
our
state
counseling
to
play
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
stress
up.
since
1966
through
1972
we
have
had
6
federal

decisions
dealing
with
the
political,
with
the
electoral
system
in
texas,
five
of
those
between
1970
and
1972.
the
poll
tax
was
set
aside
in
1966
the
excessive
filing
fee
requirement
in
1970,
the
six
months
residency
requirement
1972.
the
over
increased
cities
and
small
town
in
south
texas
and
local
city
charter
provision
requiring
property
ownership
for
election
to

was
set
aside
by
a
single

or

in
the

archer

the
certain

now
when
i
touch

literacy
in
that

i
must
point
out
that
persons
may
be
illiterate
in
english
or
not

persons
because
they
do
speak

and
they

we
have
had
in

to
that,
since
1971
three

having
to
do
with

the
denial
of

and
we
have

one

case
in
the
independent
school
district
in
san
antonio
on
school
finance.
so,
in
reply
to
that
question
why
don't
we
vote,
we
need
to
assess
a
situation
of
the
mexican
american
actually
has
developed
in
the
history
of
this
country.
a
slate
1972
we
cannot
wipe
all
of
this
hindrances
and
then
overnight
inspect
the
injured
group
to
be
able
to
compete
on
an
equal
fooding
with
those
people
who
have
never
been
hindered
and
when
you
throw
them
into
the
type
of
multimember
district
county
that
we
have
where
they
have
to
compete
in
an
area
of
over
a
thousand
square
miles
or
they
have
to
appeal
to
an
electoral
that
is
close
to
a
million
voter
where
they
have
to
raise
a
finances
and
i
am
not
minimizing
the
fact
that
the
record
in
our
brief
make
some
profuse
references
to
economic,
educational,
in
any
number
4
to
5,
that
has
be
adverse
to
the
mexican
american
population.
we
cannot
equate
numbers
simply
with
the
denial
of
right.
i
think
in
minority
constitutionally
those
have
define
purely
on
the
basis
of
numbers.
so
my
position
is,
our
position
is
that
because
of
these
hindrances
true,
we
don't
hold
to
the
extent
that
other
people
(inaudible)
also
incidentally
i
forgot
to
mention
that
i
know
the
part
of
the
record
is
that
the
anglo
american
population
in
bexar
county
we
vote
on
a
ration
of
6:1
to
9:1
against
mexican
american
candidates.
i
might
further
pointing
out
that
i
said
result
for
the
single
member
district
that
were
in
post
on
the
counties
where
order
for
the
county
by
the
trail
court.
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried
out
of
10
representatives
on
bexar
county
to
the
state
legislature.
nine
were
anglo-american
and
none
was
black
or
negro
and
none
was
republican
and
only
one
was
mixed
mexican
and
anglo-american
parent.
today
as
a
result
of
last
year
selections
there
were
four
mexican-americans,
one
negro
and
two
republicans
in
dallas
county.
today
we
have
three
--
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
of
course
the
mexican-americans
and
the
black
or
negro
over
them
or
blacks.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
that
is
eleven.
that
would
make
a
democrats
i
am
sorry,
10
democrats
because
there
is
only
two
republicans
were
elected
--
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
one
black
or
negro
and
two
republicans.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
not
necessarily
because
we
have
recognized
that
a
single
member
district
is
no
millennium,
its
not
(inaudible).
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
in
some
of
them
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
--
mr.
ed
idar,
jr.
being
the
once
or
no
mexican-americans
were
elected,
i
don't
know
that
we
had
any
mexican-americans
running
in
any
of
those
other
races.
i
do
not
believe
it
so
your
honor;
i
think
they
were
mostly
concentrated
in
those
districts
where
they
felt
they
had
an
opportunity
whether
or
not
they
had
a
substantial
majority
of
the
vote.
what
our
argument
here
is
not
that
we
feel
entitled
to
representation
as
such.
our
argument
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
participate
to
an
opportunity
to
compete.
not
to
be
counted
out
by
the
cost
of
running
an
election,
the
cost
of
campaigning,
the
area
in
which
we
have
to
campaign
by
the
attitude
of
the
people
or
the
opposition.
i
might
stress
a
fact
that
as
far
as
mexican-american
is
concerned,
there
is
no
need
to
circulate
campaign
literature
showing
what
it
looks
like
because
his
name
makes
it
put
a
self-evidence
on
the
ballot
and
you
don?t
want
to
vote
for
mexican-american,
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
the
name
on
the
ballot
and
you
do
not
have
to
read
resort
to
overt
methods
of
racial
methods
say
for
hiding
black
as
your
opponent.
i
would
like
to
make
preference
to
one
stipulation
that
was
referred
to
this
court
and
that
is
that
the
stipulation
is
on
record
that
nobody
has
been
denied
the
right
to
register
and
vote.
i
have
already
stressed
that
we
feel
the
right
to
vote
goes
far
beyond
just
to
right
to
register
and
vote,
but
i
would
like
to
stress
this
stipulation
relates
only
to
the
name
plaintiffs
in
the
law
suit.
now
we
are
not
making
and
we
are
not
hinging
our
case
on
denial
of
the
right
to
register
and
vote.
we
are
hinging
it
on
the
fact
that
we
have
been
submerged
totally
in
this
tremendous
multimember
district.
i
wanted
to
stress
the
distinction
between
this
district
and
virginia
in
the
mahan
case.
fairfax
county,
455000
population,
10
representatives
and
the
legislature
there
as
this
court
has
stated
in
its
opinion,
expressly
went
out
of
its
way,
not
to
fragmentally
but
so
simply
divided.
so
as
not
to
wind
up
with
too
large
a
multimember
district,
they
wind
up
with
two
fine
member
districts.
in
contrast
to
that,
we
have
bexar
county
with
830,000
population,
that?s
almost
twice
the
size
of
fairfax
county
and
with
that
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
and
allow
mr.
gee.
