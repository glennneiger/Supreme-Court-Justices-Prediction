mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
first
of
all,
to
counsel's
suggestion
that
what
this
court
could
do
on
remand
is
send
this
case
back
for
the
district
court
to
consider
their
motion
to
intervene
while
the
leaving
the
1972
election
results
in
new
york
in
effect.
i
would
point
out
that
that
does
not
require
any
action
by
this
court.
the
substance
of
what
mr.
greenberg
suggests
and
i
will
direct
the
court’s
attention
now
to
section
4
on
page,
essay
2
of
their
brief
which
is
the
effect
white
brief
and
you’ll
notice
in
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
second
sentence
says,
“the
court
shall
retain
jurisdiction
of
any
action
pursuant
to
this
subsection
for
five
years
after
judgment.”
mr.
raymond
randolph

essay
two
mr.
chief
justice.
it’s
the
appendix
to
their
brief
and
i
am
pointing
now
to
the
first
full
paragraph
at
the
top
of
the
page,
second
sentence.
the
court
shall
retain
jurisdiction
of
any
action
pursuing
to
the
subsection
after
judgment.”
the
second
part
of
that
sentence
allows
the
attorney
general
to
reopen
the
case
at
any
time
within
five
years.
now
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
i
think
it
does
him
some
good
in
the
sense
that,
i
think
they
can
renew
their
motion
to
intervene
at
any
time
within
this
five
year
period.
it’s
simply
like
a
consent
judgment
in
an
antitrust
case
where
people
intervene
after
the
consent
judgment
is
entered.
the
potential
disruption
to
new
york’s
1972
elections
has
now
passed
as
mr.
greenberg
himself
has
suggested.
we
believe
that
was
the
primary
reason
why
the
district
court
denied
intervention
at
the
time
that
it
did.
the
second
thing
is
that
the
4a
judgment
is
now
outstanding.
now
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
understand
councilmanic
districts
have
been
changed.
i
think
counsel
from
new
york
will
talk
about
this
in
new
york.
so
that
since
the
4a
judgment
is
now
outstanding,
that
is
exempting
new
york,
there
won’t
be
a
disruption
of
elections
in
the
future
while
the
appellants'
motion
is
determined
and
the
timeliness
problem
which
we
consider
from
the
point
of
view
of
not
only
how
long
has
this
action
been
pending
but
what
effect
would
allowing
intervention
at
this
time
have
on
the
state
of
new
york.
it’s
not
longer
a
critical
problem.
now
i
can’t
say
what
position
the
united
states
would
take
if
they
renew
their
motion
to
intervene.
we
didn’t
object
before
but
i
think
that
in
line
with
mr.
greenberg’s
suggestion
that
what
the
court
should
do
in
this
case
is
just
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
and
allow
the
72
elections
to
remain
in
effect
while
the
same
result
can
be
accomplished
simply
by
the
provisions
of
the
statute
itself.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
although
appellants
have
said
in
their
brief,
“if
we
can’t
intervene
here,
under
what
conceivable
circumstances
can
anyone,”
i
think
really
misstates
and
misconceives
the
problem
here
because
what
they
are
contending
for
is
intervention
as
of
right.
there
is
always
permissive
intervention
and
that
is
a
much
a
easier
process
to
urge
upon
the
court
because
the
only
requirement
is
the
claim
that
they
have
is
as
in
common
with
a
question
of
fact
or
law
in
the
main
action
and
that’s
even
if
they
have
no
right
to
intervene
which
is
not
our
position
in
this
case,
it
still
leaves
them
the
opportunity
to
seek
permissive
intervention.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
no,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
quite
simply,
did
the
district
court
err
in
april
of
1972
in
denying
intervention
to
appellants
at
that
time
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
new
york
and
i
will
go
through
the
sequence
of
events
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i’m
saying
as
without
prejudice
to
the
appellants
to
renew
their
motion
to
intervene,
the
difference
is
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
it
would
depend
on
their
claims,
but
we
have
--
our
position
in
this
case
really,
our
position
is
we
have
assumed
a
number
of
things.
first
of
all,
we
didn’t
object
below
to
their
intervening.
we
consider
this
a
matter
of
discretion
with
the
district
court
because
of
the
time
it
was
filed.
that
was
new
york’s
problem,
they
had
a
primary
election
coming
up,
nominating
petition
circulating
the
entire
thing
would
have
been
through
a
haywire,
but
we
have
argued
this
case
on
the
basis
that
their
application
at
that
time
was
not
timely.
now
the
difference
would
be
if
they
now
filed
under
section
4a.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
that
argument
would
not
be
present.
we
didn’t
object
before.
i
can’t
commit
as
to
what
position
we
take.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
that
maybe
true,
i
think
that’s
probably
true,
i
think
that
the
opinions
may
not
state
that,
but
i
think
that
the
gist
of
them
is
along
these
lines,
mr.
justice
and
in
fact,
under
permissive
intervention,
the
court
wanted
to
exercise
its
discretion
is
required
to
consider
whether
the
intervention
would
delay
or
prejudice
the
adjudication
parties
in
the
case.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
district
court
to
determine.
one
of
the
problem
--
we
don’t
have
an
opinion
here.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
with
one
exception,
with
one
important
exception
which
now
mr.
greenberg
has
told
us
they
wouldn’t
get
anyway,
which
is
that
they
would
not
have
held
up
the
1972
elections
in
new
york.
if
one
reads
the
papers
in
this
case,
if
you
read
their
motion
to
affirm,
there’s
not
a
mention
of
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case
which
is
about
new
york’s
literacy
test
or
whether
new
york
had
applied
that
discriminatorily
in
the
past
years.
i
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
that.
all
it
talks
about
is
the
new
york
primary
elections.
mr.
raymond
randolph

may
it
please

court.
i
would
