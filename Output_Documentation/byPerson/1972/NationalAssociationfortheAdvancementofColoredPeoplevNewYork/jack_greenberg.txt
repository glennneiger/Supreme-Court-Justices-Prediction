mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
entered
a
judgment
for
the
state
of
new
york
against
the
united
states
to
which
the
united
states
consented
and
the
judgment
did
two
things.
first,
it
exempted
the
state
of
new
york
from
certain
requirements
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970,
which
i
shall
describe
in
more
detail
shortly.
briefly,
the
requirements
from
which
the
state
was
exempted
were
of
two
sorts.
one,
it
was
exempted
from
the
necessity
of
pre-clearance
of
voting
law
changes
as
required
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
secondly,
it
was
allowed
to
restore
its
literacy
tests
earlier
than
otherwise
would
have
been
permitted
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970.
the
judgment
below
also
denied
intervention
to
the
appellants
here
when
they
attempted
to
enter
the
litigation
to
urge
upon
the
court
that
new
york
should
remain
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act.
in
january
and
march
1970,
new
york
redistricted
its
assembly,
state
senate
and
congressional
districts.
appellants
who
are
black
and
puerto
rican
citizens
of
new
york
city
and
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
view
the
1970
redistricting
changes
as
an
illegal
racial
gerrymander.
they
claim
that
the
redistricting
took
most
of
the
black
and
puerto
rican
population
in
brooklyn
for
one
thing
and
carved
it
up
to
distribute
it
in
little
pieces
among
contiguous
white
districts
making
the
black
population
smaller
parts
of
the
larger
white
population
in
the
white
districts
as
part
of
a
racial
gerrymander
which
would
dilute,
what
otherwise
would
be
considerable
political
strength
held
together
by
a
bond
of
common
factors
related
to
race.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
validity
of
those
charges
of
racial
gerrymander
are
not
before
the
court
in
this
case,
but
the
question
of
whether
appellants
can
have
a
day
in
court,
so
to
speak,
to
establish
the
validity
of
those
claims,
now
what
sort
of
a
day
that
would
be
is
of
the
essence
of
this
appeal.
the
day
in
court
which
appellants
sought
were
the
days
in
court
or
before
a
forum,
proper
forum
which
they
sought
were
of
three
different
kinds,
all
interrelated
and
again
only
one
of
which
is
here
today.
the
adverse
judgment
in
the
district
of
columbia
disallowing
intervention
washed
out
all
possibility
of
the
other
two.
the
first
forum
would
have
been
before
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
when
we
learned
that
these
voting
changes
were
in
process
and
their
implementation
were
in
process
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
that
is
involved
here
and
so
far
as
that
is
the
concerned,
the
government
takes
the
same
position
as
we
do,
but
more
than
that
is
involved,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
also
there
is
the
question
of
whether
new
york
can
resume
its
literacy
tests
when
the
1975
ban
expires.
so
even
if
the
georgia
case
would
decide
that
adversely,
this
case
would
still
be
here
with
regard
to
the
literacy
test.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
first
forum
in
which
we
sought
to
appear
was
before
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
appellants
communicated
with
the
attorney
general
concerning
the
january
and
march
voting
changes
and
said
that
when
new
york
submitted
its
applications
for
clearance
of
these
voting
changes,
the
appellants
wanted
to
appear
as
prescribed
by
the
regulations
and
make
representation
of
these
changes
were
made
with
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
racial
discrimination.
in
fact,
the
state
of
new
york
did
submit
one
set
of
changes
to
the
attorney
general,
but
they
were
sent
back
as
incomplete.
they
never
sent
them
back
again.
second,
the
second
forum
in
which
we
sought
to
appear
and
this
opportunity
also
was
washed
out
by
the
district
of
columbia
judgment
was
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
we
filed
what
for
the
purposes
of
brevity,
i
would
describe
as
an
allen
type
lawsuit,
a
lawsuit
seeking
an
injunction
to
compel
the
state
of
new
york
to
submit
its
voting
rights
act
changes
to
the
attorney
general.
and
of
course,
when
the
district
of
columbia
judgment
was
entered,
that
exempted
new
york
from
the
requirements
of
voting
rights
act
so
that
allen
type
lawsuit
essentially
is
wiped
out
also.
thirdly,
on
the
day
that
we
filed
the
lawsuit
in
new
york,
we
sought
to
intervene
in
the
pending
litigation
between
new
york
and
the
united
states
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
now
the
united
states
did
not
oppose
intervention
although
the
state
of
new
york
did.
the
district
court
denied
intervention
without
opinion
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
new
york
without
opinion.
now
appellants
have
had
no
hearing
before
the
attorney
general,
the
appellants
have
had
no
hearing
in
the
district
court
of
new
york
and
appellants
have
had
no
hearing
from
the
district
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
we
did
not.
we
merely
filed
an
allen
type
action
in
new
york
urging
that
the
changes
should
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states,
as
i
read
its
brief
and
what
it
said
in
this
case,
does
not
claim
that
intervention
in
cases
of
this
sort
never
can
be
allowed
and
indeed
it
maybe
of
some
relevance
if
the
united
states
did
not
oppose
or
intervention
in
the
court
below.
rather
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
government,
it
is
two
parts.
one,
that
there
was
no
showing
of
inadequate
representation
by
the
united
states
in
the
court
below
and
second
that
the
application
of
the
appellants
was
untimely.
we
submit
that
the
record
makes
clear;
one,
that
representation
of
the
claims
of
the
interveners
or
the
appellants
by
the
united
states
was
indeed
inadequate
and
that
it
is
the
timeliness
not
only
where
we
nearly
timely,
but
the
application
was
filed
at
the
optimum,
the
best
possible
time
that
it
could
have
in
the
interest
of
the
litigation,
in
the
interest
of
efficient
operation
of
the
courts,
in
the
interest
of
the
appellant
and
all
the
parties.
and
finally
we
claim
in
the
words
of
rule
24
that
the
disposition
below
quite
clearly
impaired
and
impeded
the
appellant's
opportunity
to
protect
their
interests.
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
inadequate
representation
of
our
claim
below,
it
is
first
necessary
to
describe
what
that
claim
is
and
what
adequate
representation
would
have
consisted
of
and
how
existing
representations
failed.
we'll
first
discuss
this,
then
the
issue
of
timeliness
and
then
the
issue
of
how
it
was
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no.
this
is
an
application
of
intervention
as
of
rights.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
an
application
of
intervention
as
of
rights
and
we
would
submit
that
we
call
for
squarely
under
the
three
principle
requirement
in
that
rule,
that
is
inadequate
representation,
timeliness
and
impeding
or
impairment
of
our
interests.
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
and
we
might
take
that
as
a
protective
position
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
think
we're
so
clearly
right
as
to
intervention
as
of
right,
we
have
not
argued
that
except
to
mention
it
in
our
brief.
now
as
to
inadequacy
of
representation,
the
claims
of
the
intervenors
arose
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970
which
specifically
granted
its
protection
to
the
black
and
puerto
rican
voters
of
bronx,
kings
and
new
york
counties
in
the
state
of
new
york
because
the
amendment
specifically
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrate
exhaustively
carried
out
the
design
of
congress
and
the
administration
to
present
it
to
vote
of
congress,
to
cover
the
north
as
well
as
the
south.
the
1965
law
had
covered
the
south.
when
time
came
to
extend
the
law,
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
general
sentiment
of
the
administration
and
of
congress
was
that
it
would
be
extended
only
if
were
made
nationwide
and
that
is
what
was
done
and
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
bronx,
kings
and
new
york
county
would
be
covered
designed
for
that
very
purpose.
numerous
senators
and
the
attorney
generals
so
testified.
the
formula
that
covers
these
counties
is
that
in
1968,
they
had
to
view
the
literacy
test
and
few
than
50%
of
the
persons
of
voting
age
registered
for
voting.
that
coverage
meant
two
things,
when
a
covered
jurisdiction
may
not
use
a
literacy
test
while
covered
by
section
4
and
5
and
no
changes
in
the
voting
laws
may
be
made.
the
keywords
in
the
statute
and
they
are
in
section
4
which
appears
in
the
statutory
appendix
of
our
brief
is
that
no
such
test
or
devise
has
been
used
during
the
ten
years
preceding
the
filing
of
the
action
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
and
i
would
like
to
underscore
the
word
effect
of
denying
or
bridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
and
color.
now
the
meaning
of
the
words
purpose
and
effect
can
be
found
extensively
throughout
the
legislative
history
and
in
numerous
reported
decisions,
many
of
which
from
this
court
which
was
set
forth
in
the
brief
but
for
purposes
of
brevity
i
am
just
focusing
on
one
thing
about
which
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement.
i’d
like
to
talk
about
this
court’s
opinion
in
gaston
county
against
the
united
states.
meaning
of
purpose
and
effect
is
elucidated
in
that
opinion
in
several
ways
that's
directly
pertinent
to
this.
gaston
county
case
decided
under
the
1965
version
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
65
version
differs
from
the
70
version
only
in
that,
no
longer
is
gaston
county
included
and
southern
counties,
but
that
the
congress
intended
to
cover
bronx,
kings
and
new
york
counties
quite
explicitly.
now
the
gaston
county
case
held
that
the
1965
act
applied
to
a
jurisdiction
where
non-
whites
were
more
illiterate
than
whites
because
they
had
received
an
inferior
education
in
the
county
and
justice
harlan’s
opinion
says
that
he
assumes
that
they
were
residents
of
the
county
at
the
time
they
received
their
education,
but
there
is
a
footnote
which
says
“the
result
would
be
no
different
if
they
had
migrated
from
other
counties
elsewhere
where
they
had
received
an
education
which
had
caused
them
to
be
illiterate.”
and
attorney
general
mitchell
and
numerous
senators
testified
extensively
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
that
same
principle
of
an
inferior
education
leading
to
illiteracy
or
an
inferior
education
in
another
jurisdiction
causing
someone
to
become
literate,
who
then
moved
to
a
northern
jurisdiction,
brings
that
northern
jurisdiction
under
coverage
of
the
act.
now
if
we
just
talk
briefly
about
this
quite
clear
aspect
of
what
constitutes
effect
of
racial
discrimination,
one
would
think
that
for
there
to
be
adequate
representation
of
the
interest
of
the
claimants
in
the
district
court,
that
should
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
that
legal
explication
of
the
statute
should
have
been
at
least
presented
to
the
district
court
if
not
urged
upon
it
and
such
evidence
as
might
be
available
should
have
been
also
presented
to
the
district
court,
so
that
the
court
could
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
bronx,
kings
and
new
york
county
came
under
the
gaston
county
decision
but
that
was
not
done
at
all
and
we
just
say
with,
one
can
elaborate
under
a
great
deal
that
if
the
key
legal
principle
and
the
available
facts,
many
of
which
have
appeared
in
our
motion
to
alter
judgment
when
after
we
were
denied
intervention,
we
came
back
again
and
said,
“look,
if
you
are
taking
the
position
that
we
haven't
presented
the
evidence,
we
don’t
have
to
present
the
evidence
on
a
motion
to
intervene
but
nevertheless
here
is
at
least
such
of
it
as
we
can
gather
in
this
brief
period
of
time.
if
that
available
evidence
was
not
also
presented
to
the
district
court,
then
we
say
that
it
is
inadequate
representation,
per
se,
and
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
we
just
don't
see
how
it
can
be
claimed
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
an
inadequate
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
of
the
claim
of
the
interveners.
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
that’s
one
of
the
requirements
of
rule
24,
the
intervention
rule.
we
may
intervene
if
our
claims
are
being
inadequately
represented,
if
we
come
in,
in
timely
fashion
and
if
our
ability
to
present
our
claims
are
being
impeded.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
statute
allows
the
new
york
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
the
statute
does
not
make
new
york's
concession
conclusive
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
united
states
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
not
–
i
am
sorry,
there
is
no
like
the
attorney
general
concession,
conclusive
is
a
matter
of
law
and
the
united
state
concedes
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
statute
doesn't
purport
to
say
the
united
states,
but
the
united
states'
position
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
issue
is,
i
would
not
want
to
put
it
in
the
way
whether
the
united
states
is
derelict
in
its
duty
because
that
sounds
some
sort
of
an
accusation.
we
just
say
that
this
action
is
concluding
the
rights
of
the
appellants
and
the
interveners
and
they
seek
to
intervene
in
the
action
to
assert
their
rights
which
is
going
to
be
effected
by
the
judgment
in
this
case.
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
united
states
is
derelict
in
its
duty,
that’s
a
characterization
that
is
not
called
for.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
it
maybe,
i
would
argue
that
perhaps
though
one
might
assume
that
they
would
be
representing
us
until
something
or
the
right
of
the
citizens
of
new
york
until
something
appears
to
the
contrary,
but
certainly
the
citizens
have
a
right
to
intervene
if
they
are
not
being
represented.
the
united
states'
action
might
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
right,
yes.
now
the
gaston
county
theory
is
only
part
of
it,
numerous
senators
and
the
attorney
general
testified
that
there
is
coverage
of
the
statute
if
there’s
a
differential
literacy
rate,
if
the
mere
existence
and
attorney
general
mitchell
testified
to
this,
the
mere
existence
of
literacy
test
is
a
deterrent
to
registering
and
voting,
quite
apart
with
whether
or
not
there
is
act
of
purposeful
discrimination
and
then
of
course,
the
matters
of
unequal
education
both
within
or
without
the
jurisdiction.
nowhere
in
the
investigation
or
the
submission
to
the
court
below
were
these
standards
explored,
where
these
rules
of
law
present
the
court
was
evidence
presented
in.
so
we
submit
that
the
claims
of
the
interveners
were
not
adequately
represented
and
as
justice
white
pointed
out
that
maybe
without
regard
to
what
the
duty
of
the
united
states
was
in
this
case,
but
in
any
event,
the
judgment
in
this
case
impairs
and
impedes
the
rights
of
the
claimants
to
assert
certain
claims
and
that
the
representation
of
the
united
states
in
this
regard
with
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
it
may
and
then
of
course
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
yes
the
statute
says
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
they
maybe
totally
and
i
have
no
doubt
or
totally
objective
and
sincere
in
this,
but
there
still
may
not
be
an
adequate
representation
of
the
interest
of
the
claimant?
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
might
say
as
we
tried
to
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
brief
of
the
united
states
is
full
of
a
great
deal
of
expression
that
we
have
made
very
serious
accusations
against.
we
just
said
they
have
been
wrong
or
they
might
adequately
represented
us
and
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
would
be
true
and
frankly
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don’t
know
whether
on
the
face
of
the
statute
they
do
or
they
don’t
have
to
represent
us
in
various
senses
that
word
might
have.
one
would
assume
the
united
states
would
represent
the
rights
of
citizens
in
the
united
states
with
regard
to
racial
discrimination.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
would
submit
we
certainly
have.
i
am
certainly
not
going
to
disagree
with
that
but
the
fact
is,
whatever
their
duty
might
be
and
it’s
not
entirely
clear
in
the
face
of
the
statute.
in
this
particular
case,
they
did
not
presented
or
argued
the
court
below
the
relevant
facts
in
the
law.
that’s
the
timeliness
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
word
and
that
is
the
brief
reduces
to
a
battle
of
our
affidavits
and
their
assertions
to
the
brief
as
to
what
one
lawyer
said
to
another
and
in
my
experience
at
least,
that
kind
of
dispute
is
quite
common
place
in
nobody's
line.
it’s
just
a
question
of
subjective
interpretation
of
what
was
meant
and
issues
of
this
sort
should
be
determined
wherever
possible
on
objective
grounds
and
we
can
see
no
more
timely
filing
that
was
then
within
two
days
after
having
learned
of
the
united
states
consent
and
four
days
of
the
actual
filing
of
the
consent.
certainly,
we
couldn’t
have
filed
before
they
filed
their
consent
or
very
well
might
have
been
premature
because
we
didn’t
know
what
their
position
is
going
to
be.
having
filled
their
consent
coming
into
court
within
four
days
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
we
might
have
been,
but
i
think
that
if
we
had
come
in
earlier
and
the
court
said,
“well,
how
do
you
know
that
they’re
not
going
to
urge
exactly
all
of
your
positions
upon
us,”
we
might
then
argue
that
we
represent
ourselves
better.
we
have
done
a
more
exhaustive
examination,
we
don’t
know
what
they’ve
done
and
so
forth
but
certainly
i
would
think
the
optimum
time
to
file
would
be
when
their
position
has
become
manifest.
at
least
i
would
urge
that
and
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
been
perhaps
an
unnecessary
burden
on
the
court
and
to
come
in
with
an
intervention
before
their
position
become
manifest.
new
york
argues
that
this
would
have
disrupted
the
primary
process,
but
of
course,
that
is
hardly
necessary.
the
court
could
have
required
an
accelerated
hearing.
it
could
have
required
the
lawsuit
to
go
on
while
a
primary
process
was
going
on,
to
put
one
on
simultaneously.
it
could
have
made
moderate
adjustments
in
the
dates.
these
are
common
place
problems
with
regard
to
voting
cases.
what
the
court
could
have
done
what
will
happen
here
if
petitioners
or
appellants
are
to
prevail
on
this
appeal
make
any
ruling
apply
to
a
later
elections
so
that
the
disruption
of
the
primary
process
is
not
a
substantial
argument.
more
of
which
we
pointed
out
that
to
the
extent
if
there
is
any
inconvenience,
we
have
to
look
at
the
fact
that
new
york
waited
18
months
after
the
voting
act
was
passed
and
nine
months
after
the
attorney
general
said
that
it
was
covered
to
even
file
its
action,
then
he
gave
the
united
states
90
days.
if
you
look
at
all
the
different
time
sequences
in
this
case,
the
time
between
various
acts,
the
four
days
within
which
we
acted
is
a
small
fraction
of
the
time
that
anybody
else
took
to
do
anything
at
all.
i
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
entered
a
judgment
for
the
state
of
new
york
against
the
united
states
to
which
the
united
states
consented
and
the
judgment
did
two
things.
first,
it
exempted
the
state
of
new
york
from
certain
requirements
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970,
which
i
shall
describe
in
more
detail
shortly.
briefly,
the
requirements
from
which
the
state
was
exempted
were
of
two
sorts.
one,
it
was
exempted
from
the
necessity
of
pre-clearance
of
voting
law
changes
as
required
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
secondly,
it
was
allowed
to
restore
its
literacy
tests
earlier
than
otherwise
would
have
been
permitted
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970.
the
judgment
below
also
denied
intervention
to
the
appellants
here
when
they
attempted
to
enter
the
litigation
to
urge
upon
the
court
that
new
york
should
remain
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act.
in
january
and
march
1970,
new
york
redistricted
its
assembly,
state
senate
and
congressional
districts.
appellants
who
are
black
and
puerto
rican
citizens
of
new
york
city
and
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
view
the
1970
redistricting
changes
as
an
illegal
racial
gerrymander.
they
claim
that
the
redistricting
took
most
of
the
black
and
puerto
rican
population
in
brooklyn
for
one
thing
and
carved
it
up
to
distribute
it
in
little
pieces
among
contiguous
white
districts
making
the
black
population
smaller
parts
of
the
larger
white
population
in
the
white
districts
as
part
of
a
racial
gerrymander
which
would
dilute,
what
otherwise
would
be
considerable
political
strength
held
together
by
a
bond
of
common
factors
related
to
race.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
validity
of
those
charges
of
racial
gerrymander
are
not
before
the
court
in
this
case,
but
the
question
of
whether
appellants
can
have
a
day
in
court,
so
to
speak,
to
establish
the
validity
of
those
claims,
now
what
sort
of
a
day
that
would
be
is
of
the
essence
of
this
appeal.
the
day
in
court
which
appellants
sought
were
the
days
in
court
or
before
a
forum,
proper
forum
which
they
sought
were
of
three
different
kinds,
all
interrelated
and
again
only
one
of
which
is
here
today.
the
adverse
judgment
in
the
district
of
columbia
disallowing
intervention
washed
out
all
possibility
of
the
other
two.
the
first
forum
would
have
been
before
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
when
we
learned
that
these
voting
changes
were
in
process
and
their
implementation
were
in
process
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
that
is
involved
here
and
so
far
as
that
is
the
concerned,
the
government
takes
the
same
position
as
we
do,
but
more
than
that
is
involved,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
also
there
is
the
question
of
whether
new
york
can
resume
its
literacy
tests
when
the
1975
ban
expires.
so
even
if
the
georgia
case
would
decide
that
adversely,
this
case
would
still
be
here
with
regard
to
the
literacy
test.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
first
forum
in
which
we
sought
to
appear
was
before
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
appellants
communicated
with
the
attorney
general
concerning
the
january
and
march
voting
changes
and
said
that
when
new
york
submitted
its
applications
for
clearance
of
these
voting
changes,
the
appellants
wanted
to
appear
as
prescribed
by
the
regulations
and
make
representation
of
these
changes
were
made
with
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
racial
discrimination.
in
fact,
the
state
of
new
york
did
submit
one
set
of
changes
to
the
attorney
general,
but
they
were
sent
back
as
incomplete.
they
never
sent
them
back
again.
second,
the
second
forum
in
which
we
sought
to
appear
and
this
opportunity
also
was
washed
out
by
the
district
of
columbia
judgment
was
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
we
filed
what
for
the
purposes
of
brevity,
i
would
describe
as
an
allen
type
lawsuit,
a
lawsuit
seeking
an
injunction
to
compel
the
state
of
new
york
to
submit
its
voting
rights
act
changes
to
the
attorney
general.
and
of
course,
when
the
district
of
columbia
judgment
was
entered,
that
exempted
new
york
from
the
requirements
of
voting
rights
act
so
that
allen
type
lawsuit
essentially
is
wiped
out
also.
thirdly,
on
the
day
that
we
filed
the
lawsuit
in
new
york,
we
sought
to
intervene
in
the
pending
litigation
between
new
york
and
the
united
states
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
now
the
united
states
did
not
oppose
intervention
although
the
state
of
new
york
did.
the
district
court
denied
intervention
without
opinion
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
new
york
without
opinion.
now
appellants
have
had
no
hearing
before
the
attorney
general,
the
appellants
have
had
no
hearing
in
the
district
court
of
new
york
and
appellants
have
had
no
hearing
from
the
district
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
we
did
not.
we
merely
filed
an
allen
type
action
in
new
york
urging
that
the
changes
should
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states,
as
i
read
its
brief
and
what
it
said
in
this
case,
does
not
claim
that
intervention
in
cases
of
this
sort
never
can
be
allowed
and
indeed
it
maybe
of
some
relevance
if
the
united
states
did
not
oppose
or
intervention
in
the
court
below.
rather
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
government,
it
is
two
parts.
one,
that
there
was
no
showing
of
inadequate
representation
by
the
united
states
in
the
court
below
and
second
that
the
application
of
the
appellants
was
untimely.
we
submit
that
the
record
makes
clear;
one,
that
representation
of
the
claims
of
the
interveners
or
the
appellants
by
the
united
states
was
indeed
inadequate
and
that
it
is
the
timeliness
not
only
where
we
nearly
timely,
but
the
application
was
filed
at
the
optimum,
the
best
possible
time
that
it
could
have
in
the
interest
of
the
litigation,
in
the
interest
of
efficient
operation
of
the
courts,
in
the
interest
of
the
appellant
and
all
the
parties.
and
finally
we
claim
in
the
words
of
rule
24
that
the
disposition
below
quite
clearly
impaired
and
impeded
the
appellant's
opportunity
to
protect
their
interests.
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
inadequate
representation
of
our
claim
below,
it
is
first
necessary
to
describe
what
that
claim
is
and
what
adequate
representation
would
have
consisted
of
and
how
existing
representations
failed.
we'll
first
discuss
this,
then
the
issue
of
timeliness
and
then
the
issue
of
how
it
was
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no.
this
is
an
application
of
intervention
as
of
rights.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
an
application
of
intervention
as
of
rights
and
we
would
submit
that
we
call
for
squarely
under
the
three
principle
requirement
in
that
rule,
that
is
inadequate
representation,
timeliness
and
impeding
or
impairment
of
our
interests.
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
and
we
might
take
that
as
a
protective
position
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
think
we're
so
clearly
right
as
to
intervention
as
of
right,
we
have
not
argued
that
except
to
mention
it
in
our
brief.
now
as
to
inadequacy
of
representation,
the
claims
of
the
intervenors
arose
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1970
which
specifically
granted
its
protection
to
the
black
and
puerto
rican
voters
of
bronx,
kings
and
new
york
counties
in
the
state
of
new
york
because
the
amendment
specifically
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrate
exhaustively
carried
out
the
design
of
congress
and
the
administration
to
present
it
to
vote
of
congress,
to
cover
the
north
as
well
as
the
south.
the
1965
law
had
covered
the
south.
when
time
came
to
extend
the
law,
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
general
sentiment
of
the
administration
and
of
congress
was
that
it
would
be
extended
only
if
were
made
nationwide
and
that
is
what
was
done
and
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
bronx,
kings
and
new
york
county
would
be
covered
designed
for
that
very
purpose.
numerous
senators
and
the
attorney
generals
so
testified.
the
formula
that
covers
these
counties
is
that
in
1968,
they
had
to
view
the
literacy
test
and
few
than
50%
of
the
persons
of
voting
age
registered
for
voting.
that
coverage
meant
two
things,
when
a
covered
jurisdiction
may
not
use
a
literacy
test
while
covered
by
section
4
and
5
and
no
changes
in
the
voting
laws
may
be
made.
the
keywords
in
the
statute
and
they
are
in
section
4
which
appears
in
the
statutory
appendix
of
our
brief
is
that
no
such
test
or
devise
has
been
used
during
the
ten
years
preceding
the
filing
of
the
action
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
and
i
would
like
to
underscore
the
word
effect
of
denying
or
bridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
and
color.
now
the
meaning
of
the
words
purpose
and
effect
can
be
found
extensively
throughout
the
legislative
history
and
in
numerous
reported
decisions,
many
of
which
from
this
court
which
was
set
forth
in
the
brief
but
for
purposes
of
brevity
i
am
just
focusing
on
one
thing
about
which
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement.
i’d
like
to
talk
about
this
court’s
opinion
in
gaston
county
against
the
united
states.
meaning
of
purpose
and
effect
is
elucidated
in
that
opinion
in
several
ways
that's
directly
pertinent
to
this.
gaston
county
case
decided
under
the
1965
version
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
65
version
differs
from
the
70
version
only
in
that,
no
longer
is
gaston
county
included
and
southern
counties,
but
that
the
congress
intended
to
cover
bronx,
kings
and
new
york
counties
quite
explicitly.
now
the
gaston
county
case
held
that
the
1965
act
applied
to
a
jurisdiction
where
non-
whites
were
more
illiterate
than
whites
because
they
had
received
an
inferior
education
in
the
county
and
justice
harlan’s
opinion
says
that
he
assumes
that
they
were
residents
of
the
county
at
the
time
they
received
their
education,
but
there
is
a
footnote
which
says
“the
result
would
be
no
different
if
they
had
migrated
from
other
counties
elsewhere
where
they
had
received
an
education
which
had
caused
them
to
be
illiterate.”
and
attorney
general
mitchell
and
numerous
senators
testified
extensively
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
that
same
principle
of
an
inferior
education
leading
to
illiteracy
or
an
inferior
education
in
another
jurisdiction
causing
someone
to
become
literate,
who
then
moved
to
a
northern
jurisdiction,
brings
that
northern
jurisdiction
under
coverage
of
the
act.
now
if
we
just
talk
briefly
about
this
quite
clear
aspect
of
what
constitutes
effect
of
racial
discrimination,
one
would
think
that
for
there
to
be
adequate
representation
of
the
interest
of
the
claimants
in
the
district
court,
that
should
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
that
legal
explication
of
the
statute
should
have
been
at
least
presented
to
the
district
court
if
not
urged
upon
it
and
such
evidence
as
might
be
available
should
have
been
also
presented
to
the
district
court,
so
that
the
court
could
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
bronx,
kings
and
new
york
county
came
under
the
gaston
county
decision
but
that
was
not
done
at
all
and
we
just
say
with,
one
can
elaborate
under
a
great
deal
that
if
the
key
legal
principle
and
the
available
facts,
many
of
which
have
appeared
in
our
motion
to
alter
judgment
when
after
we
were
denied
intervention,
we
came
back
again
and
said,
“look,
if
you
are
taking
the
position
that
we
haven't
presented
the
evidence,
we
don’t
have
to
present
the
evidence
on
a
motion
to
intervene
but
nevertheless
here
is
at
least
such
of
it
as
we
can
gather
in
this
brief
period
of
time.
if
that
available
evidence
was
not
also
presented
to
the
district
court,
then
we
say
that
it
is
inadequate
representation,
per
se,
and
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
we
just
don't
see
how
it
can
be
claimed
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
an
inadequate
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
of
the
claim
of
the
interveners.
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
that’s
one
of
the
requirements
of
rule
24,
the
intervention
rule.
we
may
intervene
if
our
claims
are
being
inadequately
represented,
if
we
come
in,
in
timely
fashion
and
if
our
ability
to
present
our
claims
are
being
impeded.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
statute
allows
the
new
york
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
the
statute
does
not
make
new
york's
concession
conclusive
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
united
states
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
not
–
i
am
sorry,
there
is
no
like
the
attorney
general
concession,
conclusive
is
a
matter
of
law
and
the
united
state
concedes
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
statute
doesn't
purport
to
say
the
united
states,
but
the
united
states'
position
in
this
case
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
issue
is,
i
would
not
want
to
put
it
in
the
way
whether
the
united
states
is
derelict
in
its
duty
because
that
sounds
some
sort
of
an
accusation.
we
just
say
that
this
action
is
concluding
the
rights
of
the
appellants
and
the
interveners
and
they
seek
to
intervene
in
the
action
to
assert
their
rights
which
is
going
to
be
effected
by
the
judgment
in
this
case.
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
united
states
is
derelict
in
its
duty,
that’s
a
characterization
that
is
not
called
for.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
it
maybe,
i
would
argue
that
perhaps
though
one
might
assume
that
they
would
be
representing
us
until
something
or
the
right
of
the
citizens
of
new
york
until
something
appears
to
the
contrary,
but
certainly
the
citizens
have
a
right
to
intervene
if
they
are
not
being
represented.
the
united
states'
action
might
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
right,
yes.
now
the
gaston
county
theory
is
only
part
of
it,
numerous
senators
and
the
attorney
general
testified
that
there
is
coverage
of
the
statute
if
there’s
a
differential
literacy
rate,
if
the
mere
existence
and
attorney
general
mitchell
testified
to
this,
the
mere
existence
of
literacy
test
is
a
deterrent
to
registering
and
voting,
quite
apart
with
whether
or
not
there
is
act
of
purposeful
discrimination
and
then
of
course,
the
matters
of
unequal
education
both
within
or
without
the
jurisdiction.
nowhere
in
the
investigation
or
the
submission
to
the
court
below
were
these
standards
explored,
where
these
rules
of
law
present
the
court
was
evidence
presented
in.
so
we
submit
that
the
claims
of
the
interveners
were
not
adequately
represented
and
as
justice
white
pointed
out
that
maybe
without
regard
to
what
the
duty
of
the
united
states
was
in
this
case,
but
in
any
event,
the
judgment
in
this
case
impairs
and
impedes
the
rights
of
the
claimants
to
assert
certain
claims
and
that
the
representation
of
the
united
states
in
this
regard
with
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
it
may
and
then
of
course
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
yes
the
statute
says
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
they
maybe
totally
and
i
have
no
doubt
or
totally
objective
and
sincere
in
this,
but
there
still
may
not
be
an
adequate
representation
of
the
interest
of
the
claimant?
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
might
say
as
we
tried
to
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
brief
of
the
united
states
is
full
of
a
great
deal
of
expression
that
we
have
made
very
serious
accusations
against.
we
just
said
they
have
been
wrong
or
they
might
adequately
represented
us
and
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
would
be
true
and
frankly
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don’t
know
whether
on
the
face
of
the
statute
they
do
or
they
don’t
have
to
represent
us
in
various
senses
that
word
might
have.
one
would
assume
the
united
states
would
represent
the
rights
of
citizens
in
the
united
states
with
regard
to
racial
discrimination.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
would
submit
we
certainly
have.
i
am
certainly
not
going
to
disagree
with
that
but
the
fact
is,
whatever
their
duty
might
be
and
it’s
not
entirely
clear
in
the
face
of
the
statute.
in
this
particular
case,
they
did
not
presented
or
argued
the
court
below
the
relevant
facts
in
the
law.
that’s
the
timeliness
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
word
and
that
is
the
brief
reduces
to
a
battle
of
our
affidavits
and
their
assertions
to
the
brief
as
to
what
one
lawyer
said
to
another
and
in
my
experience
at
least,
that
kind
of
dispute
is
quite
common
place
in
nobody's
line.
it’s
just
a
question
of
subjective
interpretation
of
what
was
meant
and
issues
of
this
sort
should
be
determined
wherever
possible
on
objective
grounds
and
we
can
see
no
more
timely
filing
that
was
then
within
two
days
after
having
learned
of
the
united
states
consent
and
four
days
of
the
actual
filing
of
the
consent.
certainly,
we
couldn’t
have
filed
before
they
filed
their
consent
or
very
well
might
have
been
premature
because
we
didn’t
know
what
their
position
is
going
to
be.
having
filled
their
consent
coming
into
court
within
four
days
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
we
might
have
been,
but
i
think
that
if
we
had
come
in
earlier
and
the
court
said,
“well,
how
do
you
know
that
they’re
not
going
to
urge
exactly
all
of
your
positions
upon
us,”
we
might
then
argue
that
we
represent
ourselves
better.
we
have
done
a
more
exhaustive
examination,
we
don’t
know
what
they’ve
done
and
so
forth
but
certainly
i
would
think
the
optimum
time
to
file
would
be
when
their
position
has
become
manifest.
at
least
i
would
urge
that
and
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
been
perhaps
an
unnecessary
burden
on
the
court
and
to
come
in
with
an
intervention
before
their
position
become
manifest.
new
york
argues
that
this
would
have
disrupted
the
primary
process,
but
of
course,
that
is
hardly
necessary.
the
court
could
have
required
an
accelerated
hearing.
it
could
have
required
the
lawsuit
to
go
on
while
a
primary
process
was
going
on,
to
put
one
on
simultaneously.
it
could
have
made
moderate
adjustments
in
the
dates.
these
are
common
place
problems
with
regard
to
voting
cases.
what
the
court
could
have
done
what
will
happen
here
if
petitioners
or
appellants
are
to
prevail
on
this
appeal
make
any
ruling
apply
to
a
later
elections
so
that
the
disruption
of
the
primary
process
is
not
a
substantial
argument.
more
of
which
we
pointed
out
that
to
the
extent
if
there
is
any
inconvenience,
we
have
to
look
at
the
fact
that
new
york
waited
18
months
after
the
voting
act
was
passed
and
nine
months
after
the
attorney
general
said
that
it
was
covered
to
even
file
its
action,
then
he
gave
the
united
states
90
days.
if
you
look
at
all
the
different
time
sequences
in
this
case,
the
time
between
various
acts,
the
four
days
within
which
we
acted
is
a
small
fraction
of
the
time
that
anybody
else
took
to
do
anything
at
all.
i
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
