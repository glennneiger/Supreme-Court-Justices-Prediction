mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
begin
on
this
climate
as
question
as
trying
to
explain
the
serious
harm
that
the
state
of
new
york
would
have
faced
if
the
delayed
intervention
of
the
applicants
had
been
allowed
in
this
case.
to
understand
this
you
have
to
begin
with
the
fact
that
to
no
fault
of
its
own,
the
state
of
new
york
was
not
supplied
with
a
complete
set
of
census
statistics
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
the
census
until
october
15,
1971
and
it
was
only
after
that
date
that
the
state
could
begin
the
task
of
during
a
150
new
assembly
districts.
60
new
state
senate
districts
and
then
subsequently
39
new
congressional
districts,
now
it
was
recognized
that
a
time
involved
in
this
and
during
this
districts
based
on
the
principle
of
one
man
one
vote
which
would
characterize
county
lines
could
not
be
completed
before
the
early
part
of
1972
at
the
earliest.
and
the
state
feared
that
a
lengthy
process
involved
in
getting
this
clear
through
the
justice
department
might
delay
the
applicability
of
these
new
districts
in
the
1972
elections
and
thus
the
section
4
(a)
suit
was
commenced.
as
it
turned
out
our
fears
were
realized
since
the
assembly
in
senate
districting
statute
was
enacted
on
january
14,
1972.
it
was
submitted
pursuant
to
section
5
on
january
24.
we
did
not
hear
anything
further
from
the
justice
department
and
so
more
than
seven
weeks
later
when
on
march
14
we
received
a
letter
saying
that
they
wanted
further
information
particularly
demographic
information
as
to
the
population
and
registration
by
race
and
by
puerto
rican
ancestry
in
each
of
a
districts
in
the
three
effective
counties.
i
may
add
that
information
as
to
registration
is
not
supplied
by
the
census
bureau,
this
requires
extra
information
which
would
have
taken
weeks
to
complete.
and
therefore
when
we
come
to
the
date
of
april
7,
when
appellants
are
first
seeking
to
intervene,
any
delay
at
that
point
would
have
caused
chaos
in
the
electoral
processes
in
the
state
of
new
york.
on
april
the
4th,
the
fist
date
for
circulating
petitions
for
the
spring
primary
had
already
commenced.
without
section
4
(a)
judgments,
all
this
new
lines
would
have
been
subject
to
an
injunction.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
appellants
at
the
same
time
if
they
filed
a
suite
in
washington
had
filed
a
suit
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
halt
the
elections
under
the
new
assembly
senate
and
the
congressional
district
lines.
now
what
would
have
happened,
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
old
districts
which
were
based
on
population
figures
on
the
1960
census
that
were
12
years
out
of
date.
now
against
the
serious
harm
that
the
state
of
new
york
would
have
suffered
by
this
delay
intervention,
what
do
appellants’
papers
show?
do
they
show
thousands
of
cases
in
which
individuals
have
been
discriminated
against
in
the
application
of
a
literacy
test?
no,
they
don’t
even
show
a
single
instance
in
which
any
new
yorker
has
been
discriminated
in
a
conduct
of
a
literacy
tests.
apparently
the
thing
that
appellants
are
most
worried
about
is
their
claim
that
the
new
congressional
lines
might
have
been
based
on
racial
gerrymandering.
they
site
no
specific
evidence
for
this
but
even
if
this
was
the
case,
there
is
no
reason
why
they
could
have
not
bought
a
civil
rights
action
under
section
1983
in
the
district
courts
of
new
york
and
trying
to
prove
their
case
as
would
have
been
dominic
as
we
know
from
the
gamelan
case
and
wright
v.
rockefeller
has
been
done
into
many
other
instances.
instead
what
they
are
really
trying
to
do
is
take
the
easy
way
out
by
a
section
5
action
where
you
don’t
have
to
prove
discrimination,
all
you
have
to
prove
is
that
the
state
did
not
comply
with
the
clearance
procedures
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
may
i
remind
the
court
that
in
the
case
of
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach,
at
that
the
time
the
state
of
south
carolina
was
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
in
a
particular
section
4
and
5
and
they
made
the
argument
that
these
sections
were
unconstitutional
because
for
a
state
to
prove
the
lack
of
discrimination
would
involve
an
almost
impossible
burden
since
it
is
very
difficult
to
prove
a
negative
of
a
proposition
rather
than
the
positive.
this
court
answered
that
contention
while
relying
primarily
on
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general
katzenbach
and
said
“all
the
state
need
do
is
submit
affidavits
from
their
voting
officials
attesting
to
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
discrimination
in
a
conduct
of
literacy
test
and
man
answer
any
evidence
that
the
justice
department
might
uncover
during
the
course
of
their
investigation
and
that
was
the
situation
here.
that
is
what
the
state
of
new
york
did,
they
submitted
to
the
district
court
every
literacy
test
that
was
given
with
in
the
past
ten
years
and
they
submitted
affidavits
from
election
officials
to
show
that
not
only
did
new
york
city
just
sit
back
and
waited
people
to
came
to
it
to
register.
on
the
contrary,
since
1964
the
board
of
elections
of
the
city
of
new
york
has
sent
mobile
registration
units
into
the
heart
of
the
inner
city
areas,
into
the
areas
where
there
was
a
high
density
of
black
population
and
through
the
use
of
sound
trucks
have
encourage
people
to
come
to
register
and
vote.
i
dare
say,
i
know
of
no
other
city
in
the
country
which
is
that
as
much
that
try
to
encourage
minority
citizens
to
vote
and
therefore
we
feel
that
this
particular
action
is
particularly
unfair
that
is
the
consequences
of
section
4
based
on
a
purely
statistical
presumption
which
we
believe
we
have
rebutted.
now
at
appellant’s
briefs,
before
this
court
although
there
was
no
evidence
presented
by
them
to
the
district
court,
they
have
tried
to
draw
an
analogy
to
the
guest
and
county
case,
trying
to
argue
that
if
you
can
prove
educational
inequality
in
new
york
you
can
somehow
try
to
raise
an
argument
of
discrimination
in
the
conduct
of
a
literacy
test.
but
in
the
gaston
case
can
be
easily
distinguished
from
the
situation
in
new
york.
first
of
all
in
gaston,
no
matter
what
the
educational
background
of
a
person
was,
he
had
to
pass
the
literacy
test
even
if
he
has
a
phd
degree.
in
the
state
of
new
york
prior
to
1965,
if
you
completed
eight
grades
of
school
and
since
1965
if
you
only
completed
six
grades
of
school,
you
did
not
have
to
take
a
literacy
test.
so
even
if
they
could
show
us
and
we
do
not
believe
they
could
that
there
was
inequality
in
various
schools
in
the
city
of
new
york,
this
is
irrelevant
since
anyone
who
has
completed
six
grades
of
school
would
not
have
to
take
a
literacy
test.
it
is
also
been
shown
that
throughout
the
ten
year
period
leading
up
to
the
institution
of
this
action,
less
than
5%
of
those
who
took
the
literacy
test
failed
it.
appellants
have
also
tried
to
raise
an
argument
that
congress
in
enacting
the
1970
amendments
of
the
voting
rights
act
sought
to
include
new
york
state
because
of
some
evidence
of
discrimination
and
yet
nothing
in
the
record
of
congress
in
the
hearings
of
a
1970
extensions
points
to
this
thing.
the
purpose
of
the
1970
amendment
and
using
1968
as
a
standard
was
simply
because
it
would
be
illogical
to
extend
the
acts
protection
for
an
additional
five
years
without
updating
the
date
of
the
election
which
would
serve
as
the
standard
in
measuring
voter
participation.
not
because
of
any
evidence
that
could
have
been
any
discrimination
in
new
york
state
and
indeed
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
clarence
mitchell
when
his
testimony
for
the
house
judiciary
committee
admitted
that
he
had
no
evidence
of
any
discrimination
in
new
york
state.
now
one
other
argument,
i
would
just
like
to
point
to
one
of
the
question
of
the
remand,
it
has
been
lightly
assumed
that
there
would
be
no
dire
consequences
if
this
thing
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
take
further
testimony.
may
i
point
out
that
if
the
judgment
below
was
vacated,
we
would
now
have
a
cloud
of
doubt
as
to
the
validity
of
all
the
existing
assembly
senate
and
congressional
districts?
more
than
that
in
this
past
year,
we
had
a
new
counsel
statute
adopted
for
the
city
of
new
york.
33
new
counsel
somatic
districts
which
would
have
not
ever
been
cleared
across
by
the
justice
department
and
therefore
all
this
new
council
somatic
districts
for
this
year’s
election
would
be
subject
to
an
injunction.
in
addition,
al
the
election
laws
that
have
been
passed
including
the
run
off
provisions
for
the
mayor
election
of
new
york
city
this
year
would
be
subject
to
a
section
5
injunction
and
therefore
we
view
the
consequences
of
a
remand
as
posing
continues
chaos
in
the
electoral
processes
in
the
state
of
new
york,
thank
you.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
begin
on
this
climate
as
question
as
trying
to
explain
the
serious
harm
that
the
state
of
new
york
would
have
faced
if
the
delayed
intervention
of
the
applicants
had
been
allowed
in
this
case.
to
understand
this
you
have
to
begin
with
the
fact
that
to
no
fault
of
its
own,
the
state
of
new
york
was
not
supplied
with
a
complete
set
of
census
statistics
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
the
census
until
october
15,
1971
and
it
was
only
after
that
date
that
the
state
could
begin
the
task
of
during
a
150
new
assembly
districts.
60
new
state
senate
districts
and
then
subsequently
39
new
congressional
districts,
now
it
was
recognized
that
a
time
involved
in
this
and
during
this
districts
based
on
the
principle
of
one
man
one
vote
which
would
characterize
county
lines
could
not
be
completed
before
the
early
part
of
1972
at
the
earliest.
and
the
state
feared
that
a
lengthy
process
involved
in
getting
this
clear
through
the
justice
department
might
delay
the
applicability
of
these
new
districts
in
the
1972
elections
and
thus
the
section
4
(a)
suit
was
commenced.
as
it
turned
out
our
fears
were
realized
since
the
assembly
in
senate
districting
statute
was
enacted
on
january
14,
1972.
it
was
submitted
pursuant
to
section
5
on
january
24.
we
did
not
hear
anything
further
from
the
justice
department
and
so
more
than
seven
weeks
later
when
on
march
14
we
received
a
letter
saying
that
they
wanted
further
information
particularly
demographic
information
as
to
the
population
and
registration
by
race
and
by
puerto
rican
ancestry
in
each
of
a
districts
in
the
three
effective
counties.
i
may
add
that
information
as
to
registration
is
not
supplied
by
the
census
bureau,
this
requires
extra
information
which
would
have
taken
weeks
to
complete.
and
therefore
when
we
come
to
the
date
of
april
7,
when
appellants
are
first
seeking
to
intervene,
any
delay
at
that
point
would
have
caused
chaos
in
the
electoral
processes
in
the
state
of
new
york.
on
april
the
4th,
the
fist
date
for
circulating
petitions
for
the
spring
primary
had
already
commenced.
without
section
4
(a)
judgments,
all
this
new
lines
would
have
been
subject
to
an
injunction.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
appellants
at
the
same
time
if
they
filed
a
suite
in
washington
had
filed
a
suit
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
halt
the
elections
under
the
new
assembly
senate
and
the
congressional
district
lines.
now
what
would
have
happened,
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
old
districts
which
were
based
on
population
figures
on
the
1960
census
that
were
12
years
out
of
date.
now
against
the
serious
harm
that
the
state
of
new
york
would
have
suffered
by
this
delay
intervention,
what
do
appellants’
papers
show?
do
they
show
thousands
of
cases
in
which
individuals
have
been
discriminated
against
in
the
application
of
a
literacy
test?
no,
they
don’t
even
show
a
single
instance
in
which
any
new
yorker
has
been
discriminated
in
a
conduct
of
a
literacy
tests.
apparently
the
thing
that
appellants
are
most
worried
about
is
their
claim
that
the
new
congressional
lines
might
have
been
based
on
racial
gerrymandering.
they
site
no
specific
evidence
for
this
but
even
if
this
was
the
case,
there
is
no
reason
why
they
could
have
not
bought
a
civil
rights
action
under
section
1983
in
the
district
courts
of
new
york
and
trying
to
prove
their
case
as
would
have
been
dominic
as
we
know
from
the
gamelan
case
and
wright
v.
rockefeller
has
been
done
into
many
other
instances.
instead
what
they
are
really
trying
to
do
is
take
the
easy
way
out
by
a
section
5
action
where
you
don’t
have
to
prove
discrimination,
all
you
have
to
prove
is
that
the
state
did
not
comply
with
the
clearance
procedures
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
may
i
remind
the
court
that
in
the
case
of
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach,
at
that
the
time
the
state
of
south
carolina
was
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
in
a
particular
section
4
and
5
and
they
made
the
argument
that
these
sections
were
unconstitutional
because
for
a
state
to
prove
the
lack
of
discrimination
would
involve
an
almost
impossible
burden
since
it
is
very
difficult
to
prove
a
negative
of
a
proposition
rather
than
the
positive.
this
court
answered
that
contention
while
relying
primarily
on
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general
katzenbach
and
said
“all
the
state
need
do
is
submit
affidavits
from
their
voting
officials
attesting
to
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
discrimination
in
a
conduct
of
literacy
test
and
man
answer
any
evidence
that
the
justice
department
might
uncover
during
the
course
of
their
investigation
and
that
was
the
situation
here.
that
is
what
the
state
of
new
york
did,
they
submitted
to
the
district
court
every
literacy
test
that
was
given
with
in
the
past
ten
years
and
they
submitted
affidavits
from
election
officials
to
show
that
not
only
did
new
york
city
just
sit
back
and
waited
people
to
came
to
it
to
register.
on
the
contrary,
since
1964
the
board
of
elections
of
the
city
of
new
york
has
sent
mobile
registration
units
into
the
heart
of
the
inner
city
areas,
into
the
areas
where
there
was
a
high
density
of
black
population
and
through
the
use
of
sound
trucks
have
encourage
people
to
come
to
register
and
vote.
i
dare
say,
i
know
of
no
other
city
in
the
country
which
is
that
as
much
that
try
to
encourage
minority
citizens
to
vote
and
therefore
we
feel
that
this
particular
action
is
particularly
unfair
that
is
the
consequences
of
section
4
based
on
a
purely
statistical
presumption
which
we
believe
we
have
rebutted.
now
at
appellant’s
briefs,
before
this
court
although
there
was
no
evidence
presented
by
them
to
the

they

first
of
all
in
gaston,
no
matter
what
the
educational
background
of
a
person
was,
he
had
to
pass
the
literacy
test
even
if
he
has
a
phd
degree.
in
the
state
of
new
york
prior
to
1965,
if
you
completed
eight
grades
of
school
and
since
1965
if
you
only
completed
six
grades
of
school,
you
did
not
have
to
take
a
literacy
test.
so
even
if
they
could
show
us
and
we
do
not
believe
they
could
that
there
was
inequality
in
various
schools
in
the
city
of
new
york,
this
is
irrelevant
since
anyone
who
has
completed
six
grades
of
school
would
not
have
to
take
a
literacy
test.
it
is
also
been
shown
that
throughout
the
ten
year
period
leading
up
to
the
institution
of
this
action,
less
than
5%
of
those
who
took
the
literacy
test
failed
it.
appellants
have
also
tried
to
raise
an
argument
that
congress
in
enacting
the
1970
amendments
of
the
voting
rights
act
sought
to
include
new
york
state
because
of
some
evidence
of
discrimination
and
yet
nothing
in
the
record
of
congress
in
the
hearings
of
a
1970
extensions
points
to
this
thing.
the
purpose
of
the
1970
amendment
and
using
1968
as
a
standard
was
simply
because
it
would
be
illogical
to
extend
the
acts
protection
for
an
additional
five
years
without
updating
the
date
of
the
election
which
would
serve
as
the
standard
in
measuring
voter
participation.
not
because
of
any
evidence
that
could
have
been
any
discrimination
in
new
york
state
and
indeed
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
clarence
mitchell
when
his
testimony
for
the
house
judiciary
committee
admitted
that
he
had
no
evidence
of
any
discrimination
in
new
york
state.
now
one
other
argument,
i
would
just
like
to
point
to
one
of
the
question
of
the
remand,
it
has
been
lightly
assumed
that
there
would
be
no
dire
consequences
if
this
thing
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
take
further
testimony.
may
i
point
out
that
if
the
judgment
below
was
vacated,
we
would
now
have
a
cloud
of
doubt
as
to
the
validity
of
all
the
existing
assembly
senate
and
congressional
districts?
more
than
that
in
this
past
year,
we
had
a
new
counsel
statute
adopted
for
the
city
of
new
york.
33
new
counsel
somatic
districts
which
would
have
not
ever
been
cleared
across
by
the
justice
department
and
therefore
all
this
new
council
somatic
districts
for
this
year’s
election
would
be
subject
to
an
injunction.
in
addition,
al
the
election
laws
that
have
been
passed
including
the
run
off
provisions
for
the
mayor
election
of
new
york
city
this
year
would
be
subject
to
a
section
5
injunction
and
therefore
we
view
the
consequences
of
a
remand
as
posing
continues
chaos
in
the
electoral
processes
in
the
state
of
new
york,
thank
you.
