mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
was
discussing
yesterday,
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
did
the
district
court
earned
denying
intervention
in
april
19,
1972
in
light
of
the
circumstances
existing
at
that
time
in
light
of
the
allegations
before
it.
under
rule
24
(a),
the
application
for
intervention
must
be
timely
it
is
a
requirement
of
the
rule.
we
think
this
is
particularly
important
on
section
4
(a)
cases
where
time
may
in
fact
be
of
the
essence.
congress
itself
recognize
this
by
assigning
these
cases
to
three
judge
district
courts
and
allowing
for
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
now
here
appellants
file
their
motion
to
intervene
on
april
7.
the
action
itself
have
been
filed
by
the
state
of
new
york
in
december
3rd.
more
then
four
months
had
passed
since
the
action
had
originally
been
filed,
the
justice
department
had
been
investigating
new
york’s
complaint
during
this
time
and
had
completed
his
investigation.
in
the
district
court,
at
this
time
the
only
explanation,
appellants
gave
to
the
district
court
for
filing
the
action
at
this
time
is
contained
on
page
47
of
the
appendix.
i
read
from
their
motion
to
intervene,
paragraph
six,
“because
counsel
for
petitioners
was
only
informed
within
the
last
48
hours,
the
united
states
would
not
adequately
represent
the
interest
of
petitioners
and
because
substantial
litigation
has
not
yet
occurred.
the
instant
application
is
to
intervene
is
timely.
as
against
this,
new
york
objected
to
the
intervention
and
their
objections
are
contained
on
page
67
to
70
of
the
appendix.
new
york
pointed
out
four
basic
things,
number
one;
the
action
had
been
pending
for
four
months.
number
two,
appellants
or
applicants
at
the
time
there
before
the
district
court
were
clearly
on
notice
of
this
case.
the
affidavit
pointed
to
a
new
york
times
article
where
political
leaders
in
this
counties
were
discussing
whether
to
intervene
or
whether
to
take
action
with
respect
to
new
york’s
complaint
the
fact
that
in
the
article
itself
which
is
reprinted
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellants
here
also
mentioned
that
a
citizens
voter
education
committee
chairman
had
not
mentioned
the
action.
the
other
point
that
new
york
made
is
that
intervention
at
this
time
would
disrupt
and
possibly
preclude
new
york’s
upcoming
primary
elections
where
delegates
to
the
democratic
national
convention
would
be
chosen,
where
delegates
to
the
state
assembly
and
the
state
senate
and
congressional
seats
would
be
chosen.
the
reasons
it
would
have
that
effect
is
because
new
york
had
agreed
that
this
is
reapportion
and
is
covered
by
section
5,
unless
new
york
got
out
from
the
act
under
4
(a),
section
5
would
remain
outstanding
and
then
they
would
have
to
go
through
the
lengthy
process
of
having
clearance
with
the
attorney
general
which
could
not
be
completed
by
the
time
the
elections
were
scheduled
to
be
held.
the
fourth
point
and
form
the
department
of
justice’s
point
of
view
and
we
think
the
most
important
that
new
york
made
is
that
at
no
time,
during
this
period
that
the
appellants
offer
any
evidence
to
the
department
of
justice
regarding
why
new
york
was
not
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
now
this
is
what
was
before
the
district
court,
these
are
the
allegations
that
were
before
the
district
court
and
of
course
the
district
court
denied
intervention
at
that
time.
and
we
think
that
the
court
acted
within
its
discretion.
the
only
other
case
dealing
with
intervention
in
the
section
4
(a)
case
which
is
very
close
to
this
case
is
the
apache
county
case
which
we’ve
sited
and
discussed
beginning
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
judge
leventhal
speaking
for
the
court
in
that
case
in
discussing
intervention
said
that
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
the
applicants
must
at
least
first
and
i
quote
“bring
to
the
attention
of
the
department
of
justice
any
instances
of
discrimination
in
the
use
of
literacy
test.
the
appellants
have
not
done
so
here
and
in
fact
just
about
a
year
and
half
before
they
sought
to
intervene
they
go
into
record
indicating
that
in
fact
they
had
no
such
evidence.
i
read
from
the
1969
hearings
on
the
extension
of
the
voting’s
right
act
and
clarence
mitchell’s
testimony
before
the
house
judiciary
committee
to
chairman
of
manual
seller
have
used—
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no
it’s
not,
it’s
not.
i
am
trying
to
indicate
why,
a
possible
explanation
why
no
evidence
was
presented
to
the
justice
department.
this
is
on
record,
i
am
reading
from
pages
251
to
252,
the
hearings
which
is
cited
throughout
appellants
brief.
chairman
seller
have
used
one
of
the
principle
officials
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
had
any
appreciable
complaints
from
parts
of
the
country
other
than
those
southern
states
which
indicate
that
there
are
abuses
of
the
type
you
have
mentioned
here.
mr.
mitchell,
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
chairman
is
no,
it
goes
on
to
say,
“i
would
further
state
that
i
would
check
with
the
general
council
the
naacp
legal
defense
and
education
fund
mr.
greenburg,
may
i
ask
for
his
permission
to
quote
him
to
the
said
committee?”
he
said
“we
have
not
any
cases
in
the
long
history
of
our
organization
involving
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
for
literacy
reasons
outside
the
southern
states
of
this
country.
we
have
very
little
litigation
on
the
question
of
voting
in
states
other
than
those
covered
by
the
65
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
that
you
should
state
exactly
within
the
record
mr.
justice.
i
site
this
because
there
has
been
an
awful
lot
of
testimony
cited
on
the
other
side
about
what
other
people
said
during
the
1969
hearings.
i
am
trying
to
set
kind
of
the
atmosphere
that
was
present
at
the
time
when
new
york
instituted
this
suite,
what
people
concerned
with
this
questions
thought
about.
we
had
allegations
in
the
case
that
well
--
we
were
interested
in
this
case
all
along
and
no
one
came
to
us,
to
ask
us
in
our
view
of
the
case.
in
fact,
that
is
not
entirely
accurate
but
the
point
is
that
for
four
months
nothing
was
done
while
the
justice
department
was
investigating
the
case
and
we
think
that
it’s
a
particular
appropriate
requirement
for
intervention
in
these
kinds
of
cases
and
the
court
in
the
apache
county.
so
help
that
the
applicants
ought
to
first
come
to
the
justice
department
who
is
investigating
the
case
and
present
it
with
the
evidence
that
they
have
of
discriminatory
use
of
literacy
test.
in
fact
i
think
if
you
remember
the
argument
of
my
colleague
here
yesterday,
that
is
exactly
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
respect
to
the
section
five
actions.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
right,
i
think
that
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
that
seems
justice,
i
will
try
to
explain
why.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
first
of
all,
the
first
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
that
was
not
suggested
to
the
district
court,
in
fact
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
i’m
trying
to
set
the
stages
to
what
was
before
the
district
court
in
the
basis.
second
of
all,
the
way
the
voting
rights
act
is
framed,
changes
in
voting
cannot
be
implemented
until
they
have
been
cleared
by
the
attorney
general.
now
the
changes
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
the
only
way
that
requirement
could
be
forgotten
is
if
the
state
got
a
section
4
(a)
judgment
removing
it
from
coverage.
the
appellants
wanted
to
intervene
to
prevent
new
york
from
getting
the
section
4
(a)
judgment.
if
without
that
section
4
(a)
judgment,
if
new
york
sought
to
implement
and
conduct
its
election
and
might
i
add
at
the
time
that
all
this
was
going
on,
nominating
petitions
were
beginning
to
circulate.
candidates
are
beginning
to
organize
campaigns
and
so
on,
if
they
had
sought
to
implement
those
changes
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
regardless
of
whether
the
appellants
action
in
new
york
state
which
they
had
implemented
had
to
go
on
forward
or
not,
it
would
still
be
a
violation
of
the
section
because
they
could
not
implement
those
changes
until
or
unless
they
have
an
outstanding
4
(a)
judgment.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
in
allan
and
i
remember
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
on
basis
of
hindsight,
i
suppose
it
would,
i
mean
we
certainly
do
not
want
to
disrupt
new
york
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
that
if
one
reads
the
--
if
one
reads
the
motion
to
intervene
which
is
contained
on
pages
44
to
47,
that
is
the
motion
to
intervene.
there
is
not
a
word
in
there
about
which
is
supposed
to
under
rule
24
(c),
is
supposed
to
contain
the
grounds
for
intervention.
there
is
not
a
word
in
there
about
whether
new
york
had
used
its
literacy
test
discriminatorily
which
was
the
issue
in
this
case.
this
entire
motion
to
intervene
is
framed
on
the
basis
that
we
want
to
stop
new
york
from
having
these
elections.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don’t
see
how
anyone
could
reach
any
other
conclusion
if
you
read
the
motion
to
intervene.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
or
in
the
alternative
if
they
had
gotten
clearance
from
the
attorney
general
but
the
process
of
getting
clearance
that
appellants
have
suggested
that
well
we
could
--
they
could
have
gotten
expedited.
the
regulation
that
they
site
in
their
reply
brief
says
essentially
the
justice
department
will
do
the
best
it
can
but
the
point
is
if
it
takes
50
or
40
or
60
days
to
investigate
redistricting
in
new
york
city
then
nothing
can
happen
during
that
period
of
time.
i
mean
the
state
of
new
york
can’t
pass
unqualified
candidates
and
this
has
an
effect
--
more
like
a
domino
effect
throughout
the
state.
if
you
pull
out
three
of
the
congressional
districts
for
example,
involving
--
or
the
congressional
districts
in
kings
county,
new
york
county
and
bronx
county
that
has
a
snow
balling
effect
throughout
the
state
because
they
are
not
done
on
county
lines.
you
have
pull
them
out
and
you
have
affect
richmond,
you
affect
westchester.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
very
close,
the
issues
are
different.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
in
section
5
the
question
is
whether
to
change
in
voting
that
has
just
been
implemented
is
discriminatory
on
racial
grounds
in
voting.
in
section
4
(a)
the
question
is
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don’t
think
that
follows
at
all
mr.
justice.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
because
the
issue
in
this
case
is
why
the
literacy
tests
in
the
past
ten
years
used
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
question
in
section
5
cases
is
has
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
is
the
new
statute
going
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
now
i
would
hold
that
a
state
would
get
out
from
under
section
5
and
not
to
section
4
and
not
go
back
to
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
would
be
unlikely
only
for
the
reason
that
if
a
state
is
not
discriminated
in
the
use
of
its
literacy
test
can
one
conclude
that
it
would
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
districts
that
it
draws.
i
don’t
know
whether
that’s
a
valid
conclusion.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
that
the
district
court
acted
within
its
discretion
as
we
said
before
we
did
not
object
to
the
motion
to
intervene,
after
the
motion
to
intervene
was
denied.
we
looked
at
the
case
and
we
believed
that
they
acted
within
their
discretion
in
denying
at
that
time,
thank
you.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
individual
appellants
in
this
case
were
five
--
are
five
people
only
from
kings
county
new
york.
none
of
them
claim
to
be
voting
--victims
of
voting
discrimination.
all
of
them
in
fact
say
they
are
dully
qualified
voters.
the
organization
represented
is
the
naacp
which
is
the
18
branches
of
the
naacp
in
new
york
city.
what
they
are
purporting
to
represent
mr.
justice
is
simply
the
right
of
minority
groups
not
to
be
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race
but
that’s
precisely
what
the
attorney
general
is
charged
with
representing
under
the
act.
we
don’t
think
their
interest
is
any
different
from
the
attorney
general,
that
is
to
represent
the
public
interest.
now
i
know
if
only
one
case
really
where
an
intervener
has
been
allowed
to
come
in
to
represent
the
public
interest
and
that
is
the
el
paso
case.
if
that
case
is
not
restricted,
if
it’s
not
restricted
to
situations
where
the
government
has
violated
or
prior
mandated
the
court
then
we
would
agree
that
in
certain
circumstance,
we
think
that
people
can
come
in
to
intervene
as
a
right
in
voting
rights
act
cases.
i
mean
we
would
have
no
other
choice
but
to
say
that
but
we
think
that
as
a
prerequisite
they
ought
to
at
least
submit
evidence
to
the
department
of
justice
which
is
investigating
the
matter
and
say
“look,
this
is
why
we
think
new
york
are
entitled
to
a
4
(a)
judgment.”
we
don’t
think
that
a
person
should
be
allowed
that
just
simply
sit
back,
have
the
evidence,
wait
for
the
government
to
complete
its
investigation,
wait
push
it
all
the
way
to
the
moment
before
primary
elections
were
going
to
be
held
and
then
suddenly
say
“hey,
we
have
this
evidence
and
we
don’t
think
new
york
is
entitled
to
the
summary
judgment
it
seeks.”
we
think
they
ought
to
have
an
obligation
to
come
in
earlier
and
present
us
with
it
that
is
what
appellants
are
going
to
do
under
their
section
5
submission.
mr.
greenburg
mentioned
that
yesterday
that
the
first
step
is
they
were
going
to
present
the
government
with
the
submission
about
why,
thank
you.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
was
discussing
yesterday,
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
did
the
district
court
earned
denying
intervention
in
april
19,
1972
in
light
of
the
circumstances
existing
at
that
time
in
light
of
the
allegations
before
it.
under
rule
24
(a),
the
application
for
intervention
must
be
timely
it
is
a
requirement
of
the
rule.
we
think
this
is
particularly
important
on
section
4
(a)
cases
where
time
may
in
fact
be
of
the
essence.
congress
itself
recognize
this
by
assigning
these
cases
to
three
judge
district
courts
and
allowing
for
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
now
here
appellants
file
their
motion
to
intervene
on
april
7.
the
action
itself
have
been
filed
by
the
state
of
new
york
in
december
3rd.
more
then
four
months
had
passed
since
the
action
had
originally
been
filed,
the
justice
department
had
been
investigating
new
york’s
complaint
during
this
time
and
had
completed
his
investigation.
in
the
district
court,
at
this
time
the
only
explanation,
appellants
gave
to
the
district
court
for
filing
the
action
at
this
time
is
contained
on
page
47
of
the
appendix.
i
read
from
their
motion
to
intervene,
paragraph
six,
“because
counsel
for
petitioners
was
only
informed
within
the
last
48
hours,
the
united
states
would
not
adequately
represent
the
interest
of
petitioners
and
because
substantial
litigation
has
not
yet
occurred.
the
instant
application
is
to
intervene
is
timely.
as
against
this,
new
york
objected
to
the
intervention
and
their
objections
are
contained
on
page
67
to
70
of
the
appendix.
new
york
pointed
out
four
basic
things,
number
one;
the
action
had
been
pending
for
four
months.
number
two,
appellants
or
applicants
at
the
time
there
before
the
district
court
were
clearly
on
notice
of
this
case.
the
affidavit
pointed
to
a
new
york
times
article
where
political
leaders
in
this
counties
were
discussing
whether
to
intervene
or
whether
to
take
action
with
respect
to
new
york’s
complaint
the
fact
that
in
the
article
itself
which
is
reprinted
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellants
here
also
mentioned
that
a
citizens
voter
education
committee
chairman
had
not
mentioned
the
action.
the
other
point
that
new
york
made
is
that
intervention
at
this
time
would
disrupt
and
possibly
preclude
new
york’s
upcoming
primary
elections
where
delegates
to
the
democratic
national
convention
would
be
chosen,
where
delegates
to
the
state
assembly
and
the
state
senate
and
congressional
seats
would
be
chosen.
the
reasons
it
would
have
that
effect
is
because
new
york
had
agreed
that
this
is
reapportion
and
is
covered
by
section
5,
unless
new
york
got
out
from
the
act
under
4
(a),
section
5
would
remain
outstanding
and
then
they
would
have
to
go
through
the
lengthy
process
of
having
clearance
with
the
attorney
general
which
could
not
be
completed
by
the
time
the
elections
were
scheduled
to
be
held.
the
fourth
point
and
form
the
department
of
justice’s
point
of
view
and
we
think
the
most
important
that
new
york
made
is
that
at
no
time,
during
this
period
that
the
appellants
offer
any
evidence
to
the
department
of
justice
regarding
why
new
york
was
not
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
now
this
is
what
was
before
the
district
court,
these
are
the
allegations
that
were
before
the
district
court
and
of
course
the
district
court
denied
intervention
at
that
time.
and
we
think
that
the
court
acted
within
its
discretion.
the
only
other
case
dealing
with
intervention
in
the
section
4
(a)
case
which
is
very
close
to
this
case
is
the
apache
county
case
which
we’ve
sited
and
discussed
beginning
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
judge
leventhal
speaking
for
the
court
in
that
case
in
discussing
intervention
said
that
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
the
applicants
must
at
least
first
and
i
quote
“bring
to
the
attention
of
the
department
of
justice
any
instances
of
discrimination
in
the
use
of
literacy
test.
the
appellants
have
not
done
so
here
and
in
fact
just
about
a
year
and
half
before
they
sought
to
intervene
they
go
into
record
indicating
that
in
fact
they
had
no
such
evidence.
i
read
from
the
1969
hearings
on
the
extension
of
the
voting’s
right
act
and
clarence
mitchell’s
testimony
before
the
house
judiciary
committee
to
chairman
of
manual
seller
have
used—
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no
it’s
not,
it’s
not.
i
am
trying
to
indicate
why,
a
possible
explanation
why
no
evidence
was
presented
to
the
justice
department.
this
is
on
record,
i
am
reading
from
pages
251
to
252,
the
hearings
which
is
cited
throughout
appellants
brief.
chairman
seller
have
used
one
of
the
principle
officials
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
had
any
appreciable
complaints
from
parts
of
the
country
other
than
those
southern
states
which
indicate
that
there
are
abuses
of
the
type
you
have
mentioned
here.
mr.
mitchell,
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
chairman
is
no,
it
goes
on
to
say,
“i
would
further
state
that
i
would
check
with
the
general
council
the
naacp
legal
defense
and
education
fund
mr.
greenburg,
may
i
ask
for
his
permission
to
quote
him
to
the
said
committee?”
he
said
“we
have
not
any
cases
in
the
long
history
of
our
organization
involving
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
for
literacy
reasons
outside
the
southern
states
of
this
country.
we
have
very
little
litigation
on
the
question
of
voting
in
states
other
than
those
covered
by
the
65
act.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
that
you
should
state
exactly
within
the
record
mr.
justice.
i
site
this
because
there
has
been
an
awful
lot
of
testimony
cited
on
the
other
side
about
what
other
people
said
during
the
1969
hearings.
i
am
trying
to
set
kind
of
the
atmosphere
that
was
present
at
the
time
when
new
york
instituted
this
suite,
what
people
concerned
with
this
questions
thought
about.
we
had
allegations
in
the
case
that
well
--
we
were
interested
in
this
case
all
along
and
no
one
came
to
us,
to
ask
us
in
our
view
of
the
case.
in
fact,
that
is
not
entirely
accurate
but
the
point
is
that
for
four
months
nothing
was
done
while
the
justice
department
was
investigating
the
case
and
we
think
that
it’s
a
particular
appropriate
requirement
for
intervention
in
these
kinds
of
cases
and
the
court
in
the
apache
county.
so
help
that
the
applicants
ought
to
first
come
to
the
justice
department
who
is
investigating
the
case
and
present
it
with
the
evidence
that
they
have
of
discriminatory
use
of
literacy
test.
in
fact
i
think
if
you
remember
the
argument
of
my
colleague
here
yesterday,
that
is
exactly
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
respect
to
the
section
five
actions.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
right,
i
think
that
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
that
seems
justice,
i
will
try
to
explain
why.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
first
of
all,
the
first
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
that
was
not
suggested
to
the
district
court,
in
fact
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
i’m
trying
to
set
the
stages
to
what
was
before
the
district
court
in
the
basis.
second
of
all,
the
way
the
voting
rights
act
is
framed,
changes
in
voting
cannot
be
implemented
until
they
have
been
cleared
by
the
attorney
general.
now
the
changes
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
the
only
way
that
requirement
could
be
forgotten
is
if
the
state
got
a
section
4
(a)
judgment
removing
it
from
coverage.
the
appellants
wanted
to
intervene
to
prevent
new
york
from
getting
the
section
4
(a)
judgment.
if
without
that
section
4
(a)
judgment,
if
new
york
sought
to
implement
and
conduct
its
election
and
might
i
add
at
the
time
that
all
this
was
going
on,
nominating
petitions
were
beginning
to
circulate.
candidates
are
beginning
to
organize
campaigns
and
so
on,
if
they
had
sought
to
implement
those
changes
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
regardless
of
whether
the
appellants
action
in
new
york
state
which
they
had
implemented
had
to
go
on
forward
or
not,
it
would
still
be
a
violation
of
the
section
because
they
could
not
implement
those
changes
until
or
unless
they
have
an
outstanding
4
(a)
judgment.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
in
allan
and
i
remember
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well
on
basis
of
hindsight,
i
suppose
it
would,
i
mean
we
certainly
do
not
want
to
disrupt
new
york
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
that
if
one
reads
the
--
if
one
reads
the
motion
to
intervene
which
is
contained
on
pages
44
to
47,
that
is
the
motion
to
intervene.
there
is
not
a
word
in
there
about
which
is
supposed
to
under
rule
24
(c),
is
supposed
to
contain
the
grounds
for
intervention.
there
is
not
a
word
in
there
about
whether
new
york
had
used
its
literacy
test
discriminatorily
which
was
the
issue
in
this
case.
this
entire
motion
to
intervene
is
framed
on
the
basis
that
we
want
to
stop
new
york
from
having
these
elections.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don’t
see
how
anyone
could
reach
any
other
conclusion
if
you
read
the
motion
to
intervene.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
or
in
the
alternative
if
they
had
gotten
clearance
from
the
attorney
general
but
the
process
of
getting
clearance
that
appellants
have
suggested
that
well
we
could
--
they
could
have
gotten
expedited.
the
regulation
that
they
site
in
their
reply
brief
says
essentially
the
justice
department
will
do
the
best
it
can
but
the
point
is
if
it
takes
50
or
40
or
60
days
to
investigate
redistricting
in
new
york
city
then
nothing
can
happen
during
that
period
of
time.
i
mean
the
state
of
new
york
can’t
pass
unqualified
candidates
and
this
has
an
effect
--
more
like
a
domino
effect
throughout
the
state.
if
you
pull
out
three
of
the
congressional
districts
for
example,
involving
--
or
the
congressional
districts
in
kings
county,
new
york
county
and
bronx
county
that
has
a
snow
balling
effect
throughout
the
state
because
they
are
not
done
on
county
lines.
you
have
pull
them
out
and
you
have
affect
richmond,
you
affect
westchester.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
very
close,
the
issues
are
different.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
in
section
5
the
question
is
whether
to
change
in
voting
that
has
just
been
implemented
is
discriminatory
on
racial
grounds
in
voting.
in
section
4
(a)
the
question
is
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don’t
think
that
follows
at
all
mr.
justice.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
because
the
issue
in
this
case
is
why
the
literacy
tests
in
the
past
ten
years
used
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
question
in
section
5
cases
is
has
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
is
the
new
statute
going
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
now
i
would
hold
that
a
state
would
get
out
from
under
section
5
and
not
to
section
4
and
not
go
back
to
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it
would
be
unlikely
only
for
the
reason
that
if
a
state
is
not
discriminated
in
the
use
of
its
literacy
test
can
one
conclude
that
it
would
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
districts
that
it
draws.
i
don’t
know
whether
that’s
a
valid
conclusion.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
that
the
district
court
acted
within
its
discretion
as
we
said
before
we
did
not
object
to
the
motion
to
intervene,
after
the
motion
to
intervene
was
denied.
we
looked
at
the
case
and
we
believed
that
they
acted
within
their
discretion
in
denying
at
that
time,
thank
you.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
individual
appellants
in
this
case
were
five
--
are
five
people
only
from
kings
county
new
york.
none
of
them
claim
to
be
voting
--victims
of
voting
discrimination.
all
of
them
in
fact
say
they
are
dully
qualified
voters.
the
organization
represented
is
the
naacp
which
is
the
18
branches
of
the
naacp
in
new
york
city.
what
they
are
purporting
to
represent
mr.
justice
is
simply
the
right
of
minority
groups
not
to
be
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race
but
that’s
precisely
what
the
attorney
general
is
charged
with
representing
under
the
act.
we
don’t
think
their
interest
is
any
different
from
the
attorney
general,
that
is
to
represent
the
public
interest.
now
i
know
if
only
one
case
really
where
an
intervener
has
been
allowed
to
come
in
to
represent
the
public
interest
and
that
is
the
el
paso
case.
if
that
case
is
not
restricted,
if
it’s
not
restricted
to
situations
where
the
government
has
violated
or
prior
mandated
the
court
then
we
would
agree
that
in
certain
circumstance,
we
think
that
people
can
come
in
to
intervene
as
a
right
in
voting
rights
act
cases.
i
mean
we
would
have
no
other
choice
but
to
say
that
but
we
think
that
as
a
prerequisite
they
ought
to
at
least
submit
evidence
to
the
department
of
justice
which
is
investigating
the
matter
and
say
“look,
this
is
why
we
think
new
york
are
entitled
to
a
4
(a)
judgment.”
we
don’t
think
that
a
person
should
be
allowed
that
just
simply
sit
back,
have
the
evidence,
wait
for
the
government
to
complete
its
investigation,
wait
push
it
all
the
way
to
the
moment
before
primary
elections
were
going
to
be
held
and
then
suddenly
say
“hey,
we
have
this
evidence
and
we
don’t
think
new
york
is
entitled
to
the
summary
judgment
it
seeks.”
we
think
they
ought
to
have
an
obligation
to
come
in
earlier
and
present
us
with
it
that
is
what
appellants
are
going
to
do
under
their
section
5
submission.
mr.
greenburg
mentioned
that
yesterday
that
the
first
step
is
they
were
going
to
present
the
government
with
the
submission
about
why,
thank
you.
