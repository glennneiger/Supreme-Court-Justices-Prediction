mr.
jack
greenburg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
reply
i
would
like
to
touch
on
several
points.
the
first
is
timeliness
and
apparently
the
time
the
appropriateness
of
the
time
is
being
measured
by
two
ways.
in
the
assumptions
that
counsel
respondents
are
making
as
to
what
was
the
reason
for
the
district
court
judgment
which
it
never
articulated.
first
as
to
the
time
and
which
we
filed
after
the
government’s
position
became
manifest,
we
filed
within
two
days
after
learning
it
and
four
days
after
filing
it,
i
can’t
imagine
anyone
doing
anything
speedier.
secondly
as
to
the
time
before
the
primary
election,
counsel
for
the
government
has
referred
to
our
action
being
on
the
eve
of
the
primary.
in
fact
it
was
74
days
in
advance
of
the
primary
and
i
submit
that
any
court
can
tell
counsel
that
if
you
want
to
intervene
in
this
case
and
you
want
to
have
your
hearing,
get
your
case
in
within
so
many
days
of
the
week
and
go
on
with
the
primary,
we
will
make
other
arrangements
if
necessary
and
counsel
would
have
been
ready
and
willing
to
do
and
of
course
do
that
sort
of
thing
all
the
time.
mr.
jack
greenburg
when
do
we
have
to
file
what?
mr.
jack
greenburg
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jack
greenburg
the
filing
date
i
believe
was
considerably
earlier,
it
was
on
april
4.
mr.
jack
greenburg
and
we
filed
our
application
for
intervention
i
think
april
4th
or
5th
but
the
two
could
have
go
on
simultaneously
was
illegal
the
court
then
could
have
taken
some
appropriate
measures
to
deal
with
that.
either
as
you
suggested
in
your
question,
let
things
stand
for
the
time
being
or
order
some
alternative
procedures
to
be
decided.
the
case
could
have
been
decided
in
a
matter
of
days
or
weeks.
mr.
jack
greenburg
new
york
was
indeed
proceeding
at
that
time
and
it
did
not
yet
have
a
final
judgment.
new
york
had
been
proceeding
since
at
least
a
month
earlier
with
the
filing
of
petitions
and
getting
them
out
and
so
forth,
so
new
york
was
that
sure
and
obviously
they
were
going
on
ahead
with
it.
if
their
procedures
have
been
validated
and
i
submit
that
there
are
proposed
answer
and
our
motion
goal
to
judgment
and
the
material
submitted
indicate
that
we
would
have
won
that
case
if
we
were
permitted
to
intervene.
mr.
jack
greenburg
new
york’s
approach
was
that
they
had
not
used
the
--
they
had
urged
that
they
had
not
used
the
literacy
test
for
ten
years
earlier
with
the
purpose
or
the
effective
rights
of
discrimination.
mr.
jack
greenburg
right
but
--
mr.
jack
greenburg
yes,
yes
but
they
said
they
have
not
used
the
act
with
the
purpose
or
the
effect
of
racial
discrimination,
their
only
allegations,
their
only
evidence
was
concerning
effect
and
the
evidence
on
effect
if
we
are
going
to
follow
the
gaston
county
case
was
all
on
the
paper
and
the
census
reports
and
various
published
reports
which
we
have
attached
with
our
motion
to
over
judge.
so
the
timeliness
thing
live
74
days
and
there
was
many
accord
and
still
many
litigant
to
get
something
settled
in
great
deal
short
of
time
in
74
days
and
i
submit
if
the
court
have
said
that
here
and
the
parties
haven’t
complied
they
could
have
at
that
point
denied
intervention
and
not
allowed
the
interveners
to
proceed
further.
none
of
that
was
--
there
was
no
reason,
it
is
just
you
can’t
intervene;
you
can’t
appear,
that’s
the
only
thing
that
was
said.
secondly,
there’s
been
some
suggestion
about
standing
here
and
we
submit
that
the
applicants
here
have
precisely
the
same
standing
as
any
voter
in
any
reapportionment
case
and
indeed
the
standing
of
the
applicants’
right
in
fortune
is
they
have
additional
standing
that
they
are
office
holders,
they
are
state
assembly
men.
they
are
asserting
the
public
interest
i
guess
as
any
litigant
does
in
a
constitutional
case
and
even
far
more
than
that
they’re
asserting
their
own
personal
interest
and
it
has
always
been
vindicated
recognized
by
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenburg
no,
i
said
that
obviously
the
courts
--
mr.
jack
greenburg
well
perhaps
they
might
have,
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
objective
record
that
we
have
before
us
and
we
will
submit
on
the
assertions
here
was
not
frivolous,
it
was
quite
serious
and
the
litigants
were
serious
litigants
where
state
office
holders
and
voters.
the
counsel
or
the
counsel
that
the
courts
were
familiar
with
and
not
with
anyone
who
is
acting
on
a
frivolous
manner
and
then
considerably
at
the
allegations
were
serious
and
the
serious
exhibits
were
submitted
in
accord,
along
with
the
motion
going
through
judgments
so
we
just
have
to
look
at
the
papers
we
have
before
us
to
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
what
the
court
may.
as
to
the
legislative
history
which
clarence
mitchell
purports
to
quote
me
and
i
did
quote
me
and
that
has
been
cited
to
the
court.
i
imagine
that
that
was
in
a
tactical
situation
of
which
he
was
arguing
that
the
law
should
go
forward,
the
congress
should
go
forward
and
pass
the
law
and
to
cover
only
the
south
and
not
the
north.
whatever
mr.
mitchell
thought
and
whatever
i
thought
of
that
moment,
congress
thought
otherwise
and
they
have
passed
the
law
to
cover
the
north
as
well
as
the
south
and
indeed
the
very
provision
we
are
talking
about
is
the
cooper
amendment
and
it
just
did
not
adventitiously
touched
upon
new
york.
on
page
19
of
our
brief
senator
cooper
said
“the
chief
state
involvement
of
the
state
of
new
york,
three
candies
of
new
york
were
involved
bronx,
kings
and
new
york.
in
the
1964
election
more
than
50%
of
the
voters
are
registered
and
more
than
50%
voted
however
for
some
reason
in
the
1968
election
50%
were
not
registered
of
voting
and
so
new
york
was
not
covered
casually.”
that
is
the
intent
of
congress
and
we
submit
that
if
the
intent
of
congress
is
not
being
carried
out
by
a
litigant
in
a
lawsuit
be
it
the
united
states
or
anyone
else
and
that
lawsuit
will
affect
that
party.
rule
24
quite
explicitly
provides
that
there
maybe
intervention
that’s
what
the
appellants
attempted
to
do,
that’s
what
they
were
not
permitted
to
do.
if
being
a
matter
of
application
or
interventions
as
a
right
it
should
have
been
allowed
and
we
submit
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
