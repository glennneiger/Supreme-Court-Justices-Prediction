h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenberg,
you
filed
an
independent
action
up
in
new
york
challenging
the
redistricting
as
such?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
won't
do
him
any
good
if
he’s
been
denied
leave
to
intervene
already?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
might
a
court
not
hold
a
permissive
intervener
to
stricter
time
requirement
into
an
intervener
as
a
bright
that
that
being
that
it
really
doesn’t
have
to
get
in
anyway
and
therefore
your
resolve
time
judgments
against
him
whereas
in
the
case
of
intervention
of
right
you
may
allow
more
latches?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
because
of
the
structure
of
the
voting
rights
act
new
york’s
primaries
could
have
gone
ahead
only
if
there
was
a
final
judgment
form
the
district
court
here
exempted
them
from
the
coverage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
that
sure
mr.
greenburg
that
short
of
a
final
judgment
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
that
new
york
didn’t
have
to
comply,
that
it
could
have
granted
some
sort
of
intern
permission
for
it
not
to
comply?
