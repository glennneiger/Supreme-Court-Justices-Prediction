unknown
speaker
is
this
something
the
district
court
would
consider?
unknown
speaker
does
necessarily
all
of
your
argument
what
they
can
do
and
what
term?
unknown
speaker
now
would
you
say
it
was
the
time
that
goes
the
election?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
enjoin
the
election
or
anything
in
anyway
to
make
a
conviction.
unknown
speaker
why,
i
would
suppose
that
everything
that
the
court
have
authority
to
what
some
election
proceed
under
some
statute
that
might
be
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
does
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
that
that
decision
would
still
had
to
be
made
is
to
whether
this
distinct
was
properly
subject.
unknown
speaker
pertaining
to
elections
to
need
under
statutes
that
the
phrase
are
simply
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
maybe
perhaps
that
--
i
don’t
know
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen?
i
suppose
that
the
government
would
have
consented
to
let
the
elections
proceed.
unknown
speaker
you
were
consenting
to
take
an
alibi.
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
other
side
would
have
done
you
think?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
was
really
the
medium,
the
motivation
to
file
the
motion?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
if
--
under
the
statute
because
you
are
obligated
to
consent
to
entry
of
judgment
here
unless
you
have
some
reason
to
believe
this
tested
and
used.
unknown
speaker
now,
isn’t
that
very
likely
burden
you
have
or
the
authority
you
have
or
the
directions
you
have
under
section
5
when
something
is
presented
to
you.
unknown
speaker
well
what
is
the
issue
how
is
the
issue
different?
unknown
speaker
i
will
put
it
to
you
this
way,
if
you
consent
to
the
entry
of
judgment
in
a
suit
such
as
we
have
here.
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
you
have
passed
the
new
york
law
if
it
had
been
submitted
to
you?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
doesn’t.
unknown
speaker
is
the
new
statute.
unknown
speaker
at
least
it’s
very
unlikely
that
you
would
consent
into
one
case
and
hold
them
up
and
hold
the
law.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
fundamental
reason
for
saying
that
not
as
in
intervention
as
a
bright
as
compared
with
--
unknown
speaker
when
do
you
have
to
file?
unknown
speaker
when
you
are
in
the
primary
you
are
on
one
of
the
districts
you
are
going
to
--
unknown
speaker
well
when
was
the
filing
date?
unknown
speaker
and
--
unknown
speaker
what
was
new
york’s
approach
if
they
did
not
need
to
submit?
unknown
speaker
so
coverage
wasn’t--
unknown
speaker
so
the
coverage
was
not
automatically
intermittent
but
on
it,
to
buy
its
terms
they
acted
cover.

speaker
is
this
