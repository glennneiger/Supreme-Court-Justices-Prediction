justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
time,
mr.
greenberg,
last
week
i
think
it
was,
we
had
a
case
argued
here
georgia
versus
united
states
and
there
was
a
question
of
whether
section
5
reached
the
reapportionments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
involved
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
greenberg,
are
you
conceding
that
your
claim
of
intervention
invokes
only
the
discretionary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
of
rights,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
i
take
it
from
what
you
now
said
mr.
greenberg,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
they
didn’t
have
to
represent
you
and
that
is
why
--
if
you
--
now
if
you
concede
that
then
don’t
you
automatically
satisfy
the
first
requisite
of
the
intervention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
but
this
statute
does
provide
just
as
mr.
justice
white
said
that
there
is
a
duty
on
the
united
states
to
consent
in
certain
circumstances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
that
is
so
and
they
may
do
this
independently
of
any
interest
of
yours,
then
i
ask
why
don’t
you
have
--
by
reason
of
that
haven’t
you
satisfied
the
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
you
suggesting
that
we
not
decide
this
case
but
let
it
go
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you’re
suggesting
is,
as
i
understood
it,
if
we
sustained
that
position
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
sustained
the
lower
court,
you
are
saying
it
is
meaningless
anyway
because
they
can
go
back
and
do
it
all
over
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
and
then
the
issues
then
of
intervention
of
right
or
permissive
intervention
that
arise
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
wouldn't
have
that
argument.
