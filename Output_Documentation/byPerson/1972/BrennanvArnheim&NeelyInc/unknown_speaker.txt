unknown
speaker
are
these
personnel
ever
shifted
from
building
to
building?
unknown
speaker
or
it’s
every
conceivable
relationship
except
that
an
employer
and
employee,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
for
each
building
there
is
a
separate
bank
account?
unknown
speaker
and
the
employees
in
that
building
are
paid
from
that
account?
unknown
speaker
and
are
those
checks
drawn
by
--
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
both
what
--
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
are
insufficient
funds
at
a
rent
or
something
to
pay
the
current
salary
bill,
whatever
it
is,
who
pays?
unknown
speaker
that
never
arises?
unknown
speaker
well
if
that
so,
then
if
it
so
happened,
not
because
the
building
was
bankrupt
but
because
it
is
simply
weren’t
enough
funds
to
pay
the
current
bills,
you
say
that
arnheim
would
still
be
in
law,
obliged
to
pay
the
minimum
wage?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
am
i
correct
in
my
impression
the
third
circuit
decided
the
employer
issue
in
the
government’s
favor?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
cross-petition
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that
stipulation
makes
reference
to
payment
of
all
insurance.
i
was
looking
for
the
same
thing
with
the
chief
justice.
i
do
not
see
any
express
reference
to
workman’s
compensation.
there
is
here,
a
reference
to
the
payment
out
of
those
accounts
of
all
insurance
premiums
etcetera,
for
each
building.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
stipulation
at
page
24
that
expenses
and
including
a
number
of
things,
one
of
which
is
insurance?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
mean
with
insurance
could
workmen’s
compensation?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn’t
suggest
that
the
--
arnheim
wouldn’t
be
a
proper
defendant
negligent,
so
as
you?
unknown
speaker
it
would
make
any
difference
to
you
if
arnheim’s
commission
exceeded
the
statutory
amount.
unknown
speaker
so
your
point,
at
your
point
--
well
so
your
answer
is
no,
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
because
these
employees
are
not
arnheim’
employees.
unknown
speaker
are
you
in
a
position
to
argue
here
that
these
people
were
not
employees
of
arnheim?
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
were,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn’t
petition
for
certiorari?
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
--
it
held
that
they
were
employees
and
that
simply
its
order
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
the
sole
purpose
of
finding
out
whether
each
buildings
grow
straddles
during
relevant
years
exceeded
the
statutory
exemption.
unknown
speaker
well
no,
that
would
expand
on
the
order
of
the
third
circuit,
they
are
not
employees,
there
is
no
point
remanding
the
case
to
find
out
anything.
unknown
speaker
correct
and
you
are
not
in
the
position
therefore
to
make
that
argument
because
you
are
asking
that
that
would
lead
to
us
revising
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
you
are
asking
us,
i
though
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
and
since
you
didn’t
petition
for
certiorari,
you
can’t
--
but
you
revised
it,
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
well
can
it?
can
it?
isn’t
that
now
been
decided?
that’s
--
that’s
the
law
of
the
case,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
cross-petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
had
you
prevailed
on
the
issue,
would
you
not
be
entitled
to
an
upright
reversal?
exactly,
just
--
unknown
speaker
the
chief
justice
is
suggesting
that
you
as
a
respondent
are
entitled
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
any
ground
that
will
support
the
judgment
even
if
the
point
you
are
urging
here
will
decide
to
the
contrary
by
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
held
that
these
employees
are
their
employees?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
what
about
mr.
seaman’s
argument
as
i
understood
is
that
if
a
real
estate
agent
represented
one
office
building
that
would
come
within
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
say
had
the
representation
of
a
hundred
other
various
small
buildings,
some
of
which
were
office
buildings,
others
were
small
apartments.
and
none
of
which
independently
would
perhaps
meet
the
standards
of
interstate
commerce.
would
you
regard
that
that
agent
had
a
single
enterprise
embracing
the
101
people
whom
he
represented?
unknown
speaker
you
said
occasioned
in
the
example
output
is
engaged
in
a
common
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
and
the
employees
of
this
hundred
various
small
operations
said
a
part-time
janitor
which
might
be
the
only
employee
would
be
brought
under
the
act
in
the
example
output.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
but
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
and
they
pay
it
not
by
the
agent
but
by
the
owner
of
these
two
apartment
building
or
these
four
office
buildings.
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
reason
here?
if
you
are
going
to
separate
arnheim
which
you
do
as
the
enterprise
as
the
separate
company
and
make
it
liable
for
which
you
are?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
--
what’s
the
reason
for
saying
that
the
major
coverage
is
the
total
receipts
of
all
the
buildings,
the
total
rentals
of
all
the
buildings
rather
than
arnheim’s
commissions?
unknown
speaker
well
can
you
reach
it?
i
mean,
is
that
the
issue
here?
no.
unknown
speaker
again,
no
cross-petition
on
here.
unknown
speaker
was
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
your
opponents
that
in
any
event,
the
measure
should
be
commissions
rather
than
total
rentals?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
why
can’t
without
a
cross-petition
that
your
opponents
urged
at
that
point
here?
unknown
speaker
and
he
asked
that
the
judgment
is
--
the
judgment
of
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
decided
against
you?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
this
issue.
but
yes,
but
what
was
it
overall
to
you,
you
are
the
petitioner
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
that
would
in
the
arnheim
and
neely?
unknown
speaker
don’t
you
give
the
rentals
in
your
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
how
do
you
answer
mr.
seamans’
comment
about
coverage
by
association?
only
by
saying
this
is
the
way
the
act
provides?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
an
unusual
situation,
isn’t
it?
where
the
basic
employer
is
brought
under
the
act
only
because
of
his
hiring
a
specified
rental
agent?
unknown
speaker
are
these
personnel
ever
shifted
from
building
to
building?
unknown
speaker
or
it’s
every
conceivable
relationship
except
that
an
employer
and
employee,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
for
each
building
there
is
a
separate
bank
account?
unknown
speaker
and
the
employees
in
that
building
are
paid
from
that
account?
unknown
speaker
and
are
those
checks
drawn
by
--
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
both
what
--
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
are
insufficient
funds
at
a
rent
or
something
to
pay
the
current
salary
bill,
whatever
it
is,
who
pays?
unknown
speaker
that
never
arises?
unknown
speaker
well
if
that
so,
then
if
it
so
happened,
not
because
the
building
was
bankrupt
but
because
it
is
simply
weren’t
enough
funds
to
pay
the
current
bills,
you
say
that
arnheim
would
still
be
in

obliged
to
pay
the

mr.

i
do

any

there
is
here,
a
reference
to
the
payment
out
of
those
accounts
of
all
insurance
premiums
etcetera,
for
each
building.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
stipulation
at
page
24
that
expenses
and
including
a

of
things,
one
of
which
is

unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
mean
with
insurance
could
workmen’s
compensation?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn’t
suggest
that
the
--
arnheim
wouldn’t

you?
unknown
speaker
it
would
make
any

to
you
if
arnheim’s
commission
exceeded
the
statutory

unknown
speaker
so
your
point,
at
your
point
--
well
so
your
answer
is
no,
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
because
these
employees
are
not
arnheim’
employees.
unknown
speaker
are
you
in
a
position
to
argue
here
that
these
people
were
not
employees
of
arnheim?
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
were,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn’t
petition
for
certiorari?
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
--
it
held
that
they
were

and
that
simply

no,

they
are
not

there
is
no
point
remanding
the

unknown
speaker
correct
and
you
are
not
in
the
position
therefore
to
make
that
argument
because
you
are
asking
that
that
would
lead
to

and
since
you

you

--
but
you
revised
it,
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
well
can
it?
can
it?
isn’t
that
now
been
decided?
that’s
--
that’s
the
law
of
the
case,
isn’t
it?
unknown

and
you
did
not
cross-petition
