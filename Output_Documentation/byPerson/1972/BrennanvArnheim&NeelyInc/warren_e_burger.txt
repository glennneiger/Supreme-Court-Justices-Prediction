chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-1598
hudson
against
arnheim.
mr.
frey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey,
let
me
go
back
to
that
bank
account
a
moment.
the
bank
account
is
separate
for
each
building
you
indicated.
does
the
record
show
who
is
the
owner
of
that
bank
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
goes
into
that
bank
account
is
the
property
of
the
building
owner,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
arnheim
and
whatever
form
that
account
takes
is
holding
it
to
--
in
trust
and
in
agency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
perhaps
not,
it’s
probably
all
the
bits
and
pieces
of
these
things
that
answer
that
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
workmen’s
compensation
liability?
where
does
that
rest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
to
determine
what
that
act
means,
we
have
to
analyze,
great
many
elements,
do
we
not?
of
the
relationship,
you
have
analyzed
some
of
them
yourself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
were
drawing
an
analogy
of
someone
like
burns
detective
agency
that
would
furnish
security
service
for
15
or
28
buildings
or
warehouses
or
what
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
burns
would
hire
them
all?
they
would
be
on
the
payroll
of
burns.
they
would
be
interchangeable.
the
workman’s
compensation
would
be
burns,
the
public
liability
which
they
undoubtedly
would
carry
since
these
men
are
armed,
that
sort
of
thing.
that’s
--
isn’t
that
quite
a
different
situation
from
this
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
frey.
mr.
strassburger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn’t
find
the
workmen’s
compensation
for
example
specifically
sent
forth
in
the
stipulation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
don’t
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
public
liability
also?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
it’s
clear
from
this
record
as
a
whole
that
if
an
employee
is
injured
on
the
job,
he
is
injured
on
the
account
of
the
building
owner
and
not
of
arnheim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
an
elevator
operator,
it’s
in
to
a
quarrel
with
one
passenger
and
there
is
a
lawsuit,
they
sue
arnheim
in
your
view
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
the
employee
of
the
owner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that’s
because
the
contrary
finding
would
have
been
dispositive
of
the
case.
finding
of
a
no
employer
but
can’t
you
support
the
argument,
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
any
ground
up
here.
you
started
to
say
something
about
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
strassburger.
mr.
seamans.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
seaman.
mr.
frey,
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
assumed
his
argument
was
directed
at
the
proposition
of
the
small
apartment
owner
who
economically
couldn’t
meet
the
standards
and
who
by
the
very
exclusion
of
the
small
category
by
congress
was
not
intended
to
be
covered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
might
be
a
long
side,
a
large
building
where
the
person
during
the
same
work
would
be
covered
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
all
discrimination,
all
disparity
could
not
be
eliminated
under
the
act.
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
isn’t
that
partly
a
matter
--
a
practical
matter
of
enforcement,
is
that
at
least
one
of
the
considerations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
conceive
that
that’s
a
much
closer
and
much
more
intermittent
associational
basis
than
buildings
spotted
all
around
the
different
city
where
they
have
no
contact
with
each
other
at
all
as
distinguished
from
the
beauty
parlor
operator
who
is
mingling
constantly
with
the
other
employees
regarded
by
the
public
as
same
kind
of
a
person.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
he
is
working
in
arnheim’s
enterprise,
that’s
what
this
case
is
all
about.
that’s
what
we
have
to
decide,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
