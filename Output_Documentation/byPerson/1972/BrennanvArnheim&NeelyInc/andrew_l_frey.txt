mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
holding
an
elevator
operators,
cleaning
ladies,
and
other
operating
maintenance
and
personnel
at
eight
office
buildings
and
one
apartment
complex
in
the
pittsburgh
area,
managed
by
respondent
arnheim
and
neely,
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act’
minimum
wage
and
overtime
provisions.
the
decision
below
conflicts
with
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
involving
identical
issues
and
holding
that
the
employees
were
covered.
arnheim
is
a
real
estate
firm
engaged
among
other
activities
in
the
management
of
office
buildings
and
apartment
houses
as
agents
for
the
owners
of
such
buildings.
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought,
it
managed
a
total
of
nine
such
buildings
for
various
unrelated
owners.
arnheim’s
management
activities
are
carried
out
under
basically
identical
contracts
with
each
of
the
building
owners.
under
which
arnheim
assumes
all
of
the
functions
of
managing
and
operating
the
buildings
including
the
procurement
of
tenants
and
negotiation
and
enforcement
of
leases,
the
collection
of
rents,
arrangement
for
utilities
and
other
services,
in
short
all
aspects
of
the
operation
of
the
buildings.
now
arnheim’s
business
is
conducted
from
its
central
office
and
managed
by
supervisory
management
personnel
operating
out
of
that
central
office.
with
respect
to
each
building,
arnheim
collects
the
rents,
deposits
them
in
separate
bank
accounts
and
uses
the
funds
to
pay
the
operating
expenses
of
the
buildings
to
pay
its
commissions
and
to
remit
the
balance
to
the
owners.
now,
arnheim
has
extensive
responsibilities
in
connection
with
personnel
employed
at
the
various
buildings
and
i
am
talking
about
such
personnel
as
elevator
operators,
cleaning
ladies,
watchmen,
building
engineers
and
so
on.
functions
and
responsibilities
of
arnheim
with
respect
to
these
personnel
are
spelled
out
in
detail
in
the
stipulation
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
and
that’s
in
the
appendix
and
also
at
pages
5
and
6
of
our
brief.
now
briefly
summarized,
these
functions
involved
hiring,
promotion,
and
firing
of
all
personnel;
supervision
of
their
performance
of
their
employment,
making
work
assignments
and
scheduling
the
time
of
work,
negotiating
union
contracts,
determining
rates
of
pay
and
benefits,
preparing
payroll
and
maintenance
of
other
employee
records
and
payment
of
salaries.
in
short,
every
conceivable
incident
of
the
employer-employee
relationship
is
encompassed
in
arnheim’s
responsibility,
although
the
owners
are
consulted
and
enjoy
of
veto
with
respect
to
certain
matters
such
as
the
rates
of
pay
and
promotions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don’t
believe
that
in
this
--
that
the
record
reflects
that
they
are
shifted.
they
are
employed
for
a
particular
building.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
relationship
of
employer
and
employee.
our
position
is
and
i
think
this
court
has
clearly
held
certainly
in
the
context
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
in
determining
the
employer-employee
relationship,
you
don’t
look
solely
at
the
common
law
concepts
and
you
don’t
--
and
in
any
event
even
if
you
did
the
right
to
hire,
the
right
to
fire
even
if
it
is
a
shared
responsibility
with
another
person
gives
you
a
status
as
an
employer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
a
separate
bank
account.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
by
arnheim
and
neely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
isn’t
arnheim
and
neely
account,
it
would
be
labeled
arnheim
and
neely
clock
building
accounts.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
record
doesn’t
indicate
that
that
arises.
our
position
in
such
an
instance,
suppose
the
building
owner
went
bankrupt
and
--
i
will
come
this
a
little
later.
our
position
would
be
that
arnheim
would
be
responsible
for
payment
of
minimum
wages
then
arnheim
is
under
the
act
of
employer
in
that
sense.
and
it
has
every
power
that
an
employer
has.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
our
position.
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
essential
for
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
their
responsibility
to
pay
the
light
bill
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law
and
of
contract
between
them
and
the
building
owner
but
here
we
have
a
special
situation
which
is
that
they
do
serve
as
employers
of
these
people
under
the
act
and
if
these
people
are
entitled
to
the
acts
protection,
then
the
employer
is
reliable
to
see
that
they
get
it.
and
as
both
arnheim
in
this
case
and
the
building
owners
and
i
will
expand
on
this
shortly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct
your
honor.
again
later
on,
i
think
i
will
indicate
that
there
is
an
argument
that’s
made
that
this
is
somehow
still
relevant
to
the
enterprise
question
which
is
really
before
the
court
today
but
we
think
that
argument
is
fallacious.
now,
the
secretary
of
labor
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
to
compel
arnheim
and
neely,
to
comply
with
the
minimum
wage,
the
overtime
and
the
record-keeping
provisions
of
the
act.
arnheim
raised
basically
four
defenses.
first,
it
contended
that
it
was
not
the
employer
of
these
employees
that
the
building
owner
was.
the
district
court
rejected
that
contention,
it
looks
both
that
the
relationship
in
arnheim
actually
had
to
these
employees
and
to
the
definition
in
the
act
on
how
that
it
was
an
employer.
secondly,
arnheim
contended
that
that
in
determining
whether
the
dollar
volume
requirements
of
the
act
are
met,
the
court
should
consider
only
arnheim’s
commissions
and
not
the
gross
rents
from
the
buildings.
this
argument
too
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
thirdly
and
this
is
the
key
issue
in
this
case
today,
arnheim
contended
that
its
business
was
not
an
enterprise
under
the
act
but
rather
that
the
employees
at
these
buildings
were
employed
and
its
many
different
enterprises
as
there
were
separate
building
owners.
finally,
an
issue
that
is
not
raised
by
either
side
here,
there
was
an
issue
regarding
the
nexus
to
interstate
commerce
and
the
district
court
held
that
prior
to
february
1,
1967,
the
necessary
nexus
did
not
exist
and
dismissed
the
secretary
suit
as
to
that
prior
period
subsequent
to
february
1,
1967
when
the
statute
was
amended.
the
court
held
that
the
necessary
nexus
did
exist
and
we
don’t
understand
that
issue
to
be
contested.
on
appeal,
the
third
circuit
held
an
agreement
with
the
government’s
position
on
the
district
court
that
arnheim
is
an
employer
of
these
employees
under
the
act.
it
secondly
held
also
an
agreement
with
the
government
and
with
the
district
court
that
the
proper
measure
of
gross
revenues
for
purposes
of
determining
coverage
under
section
3
(s)
of
the
act
is
rents
and
not
merely
arnheim’s
commissions.
however,
they
agreed
with
arnheim
that
it
was
not
conducting
a
single
enterprise
but
rather
as
many
different
enterprises
as
they
were
different
building
owners.
accordingly,
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
whether
each
of
these,
whether
any
of
these
separate
enterprises
met
the
dollar
volume
requirements
of
the
act
to
create
an
enterprise
in
which
the
employees
would
be
covered.
our
petition
for
certiorari
raised
solely
the
issue
of
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals
definition
of
arnheim’s
enterprise.
no
cross-petition
was
filed
with
respect
to
the
issues
won
by
the
government
below
nor
were
they
raise
in
the
brief
in
our
position
to
the
certiorari
petition.
turning
to
the
merits,
the
government’s
theory
is
that
these
employees
are
employed
in
arnheim
and
neely’s
enterprise,
the
management
of
office
and
apartment
buildings
for
others
and
that
the
activities
that
all
the
buildings
arnheim
manages
are
part
of
a
single
enterprise.
question
presented
to
this
court
is
fundamentally
one
of
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
we
submit
these
provisions
are
acceptable
of
only
one
interpretation
and
that
interpretation
provides
coverage
for
these
employees.
let’s
take
john
doe,
an
elevator
operator
of
one
of
the
buildings
that
arnheim
manages,
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
is
protected
by
the
minimum
wage
provisions
which
it
contained
in
section
6
of
the
act
would
begin
by
looking
at
section
6
which
says
every
employer
shall
pay
to
each
of
his
employees
and
i
am
skipping
to
the
relevant
part,
employed
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
wages
at
certain
rates.
now
the
phrase
“engaged
in
the
--employed
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce
or
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce”
is
defined
in
section
3
(s).
its
there
defined
as
an
enterprise
whose
annual
gross
volume
of
sales
made
or
business
done
is
not
less
than
$500,000
if
we
are
talking
about
the
period
from
february
1967
to
january
1969.
so
the
question
is,
is
john
doe
employed
in
an
enterprise
which
has
the
necessary
dollar
volumes?
now
“enterprise”
as
defined
in
section
3
(r)
and
here
we
are
the
crux
of
the
case.
the
relevant
portion
says
that
an
enterprise
means
“the
related
activities
performed
either
through
unified
operation
or
common
control
by
any
person
or
persons
for
a
common
business
purpose,
and
includes
all
such
activities
whether
performed
in
one
or
more
establishments
or
by
one
or
more
corporate
or
other
organizational
units.”
now
arnheim’s
activities
as
a
manager
of
office
and
apartment
buildings
for
others
clearly
constitute
a
single
enterprise
under
this
definition.
there
are
three
elements
that
need
to
be
met.
are
they
related
activities?
and
congress
has
not
defined
related
activities
per
se
but
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
consider
related
activities
to
be
those
that
are
the
same
or
similar.
looking
in
arnheim’s
activities
that
each
of
the
office
buildings
and
apartment
buildings
that
have
manages,
it
does
the
same
thing
under
basically
the
same
agreement
with
the
building
owner
clearly
related
activities
we
submit.
the
second
requirement
is,
are
these
activities
performed
through
a
unified
operation
or
common
control?
now,
the
common
control
requirement
is
satisfied
if
they’re
performed
by
a
single
company.
arnheim
and
neely
incorporated
runs
the
business
of
arnheim
and
neely,
incorporated
and
that’s
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
the
common
control
requirement
is
met.
in
addition,
although
it’s
not
necessary
to
meet
both,
arnheim’s
business
of
managing
buildings
is
run
through
unified
operations.
that
is
out
of
its
central
arnheim
and
neely
office
where
its
management
and
supervisory
personnel
and
clerical
personnel
work.
finally,
these
related
activities
must
be
engaged
in,
for
a
common
business
purpose.
again,
we
think
it’s
clear
that
the
requirement
is
met.
the
emphasis
of
congress
was
on
the
word
“business”
to
distinguish
between
business
and
charitable.
here,
the
activities
that
each
of
the
nine
buildings
are
undertaken
by
arnheim
for
its
business
purpose
of
managing
buildings
and
making
a
profit
from
that
activity.
how
then
did
the
court
of
appeals
reach
a
different
conclusion?
it
did
so
by
completely
ignoring
arnheim’s
enterprise
and
by
looking
instead
at
arnheim’s
clients
the
building
owners.
it
found
that
the
building
owners
did
not
share
common
business
purpose
that
they
have
nine
distinct
enterprises.
this
finding
was
absolutely
correct.
we
have
no
problem
with
it,
whatsoever.
but
it’s
irrelevant
as
applied
to
this
case
because
it’s
arnheim’s
enterprise
in
which
we
contend
that
these
individuals
are
employed.
now,
there
is
a
fact
which
is
perhaps
overlooked
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
respondents
herein
which
is
that
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
it’s
possible
to
be
employed
in
more
than
one
enterprise
at
the
same
time.
and
indeed
that’s
exactly
what
appears
to
have
happened
here.
these
persons
are
employed
in
the
building
owners
enterprise
which
is
to
own
real
estate.
they
are
employed
in
arnheim
and
neely’s
enterprise
which
is
to
manage
real
estate.
they
are
involved
in
both
of
those
businesses.
now,
where
they
are
employed
by
more
than
one
enterprise,
if
one
of
the
enterprises
comes
within
the
coverage
requirements
of
section
3
(s)
then
the
employee
is
protected
regardless
of
whether
the
other
enterprise
by
which
he
may
also
be
employed
comes
within
section
3
(s)
or
not.
now,
i
think
the
example
that
we
gave
in
our
reply
brief
of
the
warehouses
retaining
the
protective
agency
will
illustrate
the
fallacy
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
supposed
you
have
nine
separate
warehouses,
each
completely
independent
business
having
no
connection
with
one
another.
they
all
require
security
services,
night
watchmen,
they
all
retain
the
same
protection
agency
and
the
issue
is,
are
these
night
watchmen
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act?
now
of
course
if
you
look
at
the
enterprises
of
the
warehouses
in
which
they
may
be
employed,
their
station
let
us
say
at
the
same
warehouse
every
night
that
they
were.
you
might
say
“well,
the
warehouse
doesn’t
have
an
enterprise
that
fits
the
statutory
requirement,
therefore
they
are
not
covered.
but
of
course
they
are
also
employed
in
the
protection
agencies
enterprise
which
is
to
provide
night
watchmen
and
various
warehouses
and
other
business
as
there
in
the
city.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
structure
of
the
act
makes
it
quite
clear
that
coverage
does
not
turn
on
who
is
responsible
for
your
wages.
the
question
is
“are
you
employed
in
an
enterprise?”
which
comes
within
the
definition.
now,
how
could
one
say
that
these
elevator
operators
are
not
employed
in
arnheim’s
enterprise?
arnheim’s
enterprise
is
to
operate
buildings
and
these
--
without
the
elevator
operators,
arnheim
couldn’t
conduct
its
business
in
managing
these
buildings.
and
therefore
these
men
are
employed
in
arnheim’s
enterprise
and
it
doesn’t
matter
whose
employees
they
are.
it
doesn’t
matter
who
pays
them.
now,
the
redcap
cases
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
are
an
illustration
of
a
situation
in
which
the
court
has
held
that
even
though
the
railway
company
is
not
paying
the
redcaps
their
salary,
they
are
totally
dependent
upon
tips
from
the
passengers
that
it
isn’t
payment
of
salary
who
bears
the
ultimate
salary
burden.
that’s
the
critical
issue.
the
issue
is,
who
has
control
over
the
day
to
day
conduct
of
these
employees?
are
they
involved
in
the
aircraft?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondents
or
perhaps
by
the
amicus,
i
think
it’s
the
royal
crown
case
involves
the
situation
where
the
president
of
a
company
was
held
personally
liable
under
the
act
because
of
the
extent
of
his
involvement.
but
here,
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
point.
the
plant
manager
would
not
be
considered
to
have
an
enterprise.
we
are
talking
about
whose
enterprise
to
these
people
working.
are
they
working
in
an
enterprise
which
is
covered
under
the
act?
now,
it
would
be
possible
that
they
could
work
in
an
enterprise
and
the
operator
of
that
enterprise
would
not
be
liable
for
their
wages
and
the
example
of
that
would
be
the
beauty
salon
operating
as
leasing
space
in
a
department
store.
now,
the
employees
of
that
beauty
salon,
if
the
department
store’s
enterprise
qualified
under
the
act,
the
revenues
of
the
beauty
salon
would
be
included
within
the
department
stores
enterprise
to
determine
whether
it
was
subject
to
the
act
and
the
employees
in
the
beauty
salon
would
be
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
at
even
though
the
department
store
exercise,
no
control
whatsoever
over
them.
the
department
store
might
have
no
liability
to
pay
the
minimum
wages.
the
beauty
salon
operator
who
does
not
have
an
enterprise
with
$500,000
would
be
liable
to
pay
because
these
persons
are
employed
in
an
enterprise
which
meets
the
acts
requirements.
and
this
is
a
very
important
point
that
that
is
overlooked
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondents
in
the
amicus.
now,
i
think
i
was
just
getting
to
this
point
actually
and
i
think
perhaps
i’ve
adequately
covered
it.
so,
in
closing,
let
me
say
this,
it
seems
clear
that
the
underpinnings
of
the
third
circuits
decision
was
a
concern
for
the
impact
of
the
minimum
wage
laws
on
the
business
of
the
building
owners.
now,
it
is
of
course
an
inevitable
feature
of
such
laws
that
they
raise
the
cost
of
certain
goods
and
services
and
thereby
adversely
affect
the
consumers
of
those
goods
and
services,
many
of
whom
maybe
small
businesses.
this
is
never
in
the
past
in
anyway
discouraged
congress
from
adopting
and
from
expending
the
coverage
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
any
event,
the
concern
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
these
building
owners
seems
to
us
misplaced
in
this
instance.
it’s
by
retaining
a
firm
such
as
arnheim
and
neely
to
manage
its
buildings
but
the
building
owners
realize
important
benefits
of
an
economic
nature
for
themselves.
these
benefits
derive
from
the
skill
of
arnheim’s
operation
from
the
fact
that
it
manages
many
buildings
that
it
is
able
to
hire
for
instance
experienced
top
management
personnel
to
manage
office
buildings
which
wouldn’t
be
justified
if
only
a
single
office
building
were
being
managed
so
that
substantial
benefits
are
being
conferred
upon
the
building
owners
when
they
retain
arnheim
and
this
notion
that
if
they
have
to
pay
the
minimum
wages,
they
will
all
stop
retaining
real
estate
management
firms
is
totally
without
foundation
in
the
record
and
we
believe
contrary
to
normal
experience.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
certain
who
was
the
owner.
i
believe
that
it’s
in
arnheim’s
name,
i
assume
that
it
is
a
trust
at
least
that
is
in
our
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statutory
issue
with
which
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
question
is,
are
they
employed
in
an
enterprise
and
looking
at
arnheim
and
neely.
what
is
arnheim
and
neely’s
are
their
activities
at
each
of
these
nine
buildings,
part
of
one
single
enterprise?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
certain
your
honor
where
that
would
rest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
workman’s
compensation
law
would
be
governed
in
part
by
the
state
law.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
question
is,
what
does
that
act
mean?
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
but
i
believe
that
it’s
possible
to
totally
ignore
the
relationship
between
the
building
owners
and
arnheim.
the
relationship
with
which
we
are
concerned
is
between
arnheim
and
the
business
that
arnheim
is
conducting
and
secondly
between
arnheim
and
this
personnel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don’t
mean
to
suggest
that
in
the
burns
illustration,
i
didn’t
mean
necessarily
that
the
protective
agency
would
hire
these
people.
they
could
be
joint
employers
and
i
think
it’s
very
important
that
in
this
case,
the
agreement
between
arnheim
and
the
building
owner
could
be
setup
in
such
a
way
that
arnheim
would
not
be
liable
under
the
act.
arnheim
can
simply
get
out
of
the
business
of
running
these
buildings
with
these
personnel
and
leave
that
to
the
building
owner.
it
could
stick
to
collection
of
rents
and
procurement
of
tenants
and
handling
the
bank
account
for
the
building
let’s
say.
if
it
did
that,
then
these
employees
would
no
longer
be
employed
in
arnheim’s
enterprise
and
we
would
not
be
seeking
to
establish
arnheim’s
liability.
by
that
same
token,
the
building
owners
can
get
out
of
liability
under
the
act
by
withdrawing
any
of
their
employment
control.
that
is,
they
could
leave
it
up
to
arnheim
to
pay
whatever
salary
arnheim
wants
and
just
reimburse
arnheim
on
a
cost
plus
basis
for
doing
that.
and
such
a
case
which
would
be
irrelatively
minor
change
in
the
existing
agreement,
the
building
owners
would
be
off
to
hook
as
far
as
liability
for
payment
of
minimum
wages
and
for
making
sure
that
the
necessary
records
are
kept
and
so
on,
that
would
all
be
arnheim.
in
this
case,
they
have
chosen
to
setup
their
relationship
in
a
manner
that
makes
them
both
liable
because
they
are
both
--
because
these
persons
are
employed
in
both
of
their
enterprises
and
they
are
both
employers
under
the
definition
of
the
act
which
both
courts
below
have
held.
now,
i
think
when
we
are
talking
about
the
policy
that
informs
and
underlies
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
there
are
numerous
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
this
policy
and
i
want
to
refer
to
one
in
the
house
report
in
connection
with
the
1966
amendments
to
the
act.
the
committee
said,
in
keeping
with
the
broad
statutory
definitions
of
the
“coverage”
phrase
is
used.
the
courts
have
repeatedly
expressed
and
adhere
to
the
principle
that
the
coverage
phrases
should
receive
a
liberal
interpretation
consonant
with
the
definitions
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
with
its
character
as
remedial
and
humanitarian
legislation.
however,
despite
the
acts
broad
coverage
terms
and
the
court’s
liberal
interpretations
regarding
coverage
and
restrictive
interpretations
regarding
exemptions,
there
is
great
need
for
extending
the
present
coverage
of
the
act
to
large
groups
of
workers
whose
earnings
today
are
unjustifiably
and
disproportionably
low.
now,
it’s
that
policy
and
not
any
concern
for
small
business
man
that
as
a
basic
policy
that
underlies
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
given
that
policy,
there
is
no
reason
to
ignore
or
distort
the
clear
statutory
language
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
these
employees
from
obtaining
the
benefits
of
the
act.
if
there
are
not
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
sir.
first
with
respect
to
mr.
seamans’
comments,
i
think
he
misses
a
fundamental
point.
it’s
not
the
building
owners
that
are
subject
to
the
act
or
covered
by
the
act.
it’s
the
employees
that
are
covered
by
the
act.
the
issue
is,
are
these
employees
in
an
enterprise?
not
are
these
building
owners
covered
by
the
act?
well,
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
congress
intended
that
employees
who
were
employed
in
an
enterprise
--
who
are
not
employed
in
an
enterprise
of
a
certain
size
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
it’s
entirely
possible
that
you
could
have
two
buildings,
one
small
and
independently
operated
where
the
only
enterprise
is
under
$500,000
and
one
along
side
that’s
larger
where
the
enterprise
were
either
the
office
building
itself
has
enough
revenues
to
come
within
there.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
no
matter
how
you
structured
it
unless
you
just
made
it
applicable
across
the
board
to
all
employees,
there
would
be
some
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
congress.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
congress
felt
that
in
--
where
you
were
dealing
with
what
say
the
mom
and
pop
grocery
store.
that
the
impact
on
commerce
was
relatively
limited
from
such
an
enterprise
and
that
congress
would
give
them
a
break,
these
vary
small
business.
now,
arnheim
and
neely
is
not
such
a
business.
this
is
not
a
mom
and
pop
store.
and
of
course
they
keep
trying
to
talk
about
the
building
owners
as
the
one
arnheim
and
neely
had
no
business.
for
instance,
they
say
an
enterprise
must
have
an
ownership.
well,
there
is
ownership
here.
arnheim
and
neely
owns
arnheim
and
neely.
and
it
conducts
the
enterprise
of
arnheim
and
neely.
that’s
the
sense,
the
only
sense
in
which
ownership
is
required.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
it
was
held
that
these
are
their
employees.
that’s
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
would
not
make
any
distinction
on
the
basis
of
whether
any
particular
ones
of
the
buildings
that
were
managed
happened
to
meet
the
dollar
limit.
what
we
would
say
is,
is
he
conducting
an
enterprise?
if
his
enterprise
may
for
instance
the
doctor-patient
example
used
in
the
respondent’s
brief.
i
think
highlights
this
point
clearly.
they
say,
well
the
patients,
each
come
to
the
doctor
and
the
patient
are
unrelated
to
one
another.
the
patients
are
not
engaging
in
related
activities.
they
have
no
common
health
purpose
when
they
come
to
the
doctor,
therefore,
how
could
you
say
that
there
would
be
an
enterprise.
well,
the
doctor
is
engaged
in
a
common
business
purpose.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
look
at
the
way
in
which
--
i
would
look
at
the
activities
that
he
undertakes
and
i
would
look
to
see
whether
they
are
related
activities.
whether
they
are
conducted
through
unified
operation
and
common
control
and
whether
they
are
conducted
for
common
business
purpose.
if
i
found
all
those
things
then
i
would
say
yes.
he
is
an
enterprise
under
the
act
regardless
whether
the
individual
pieces
of
his
business.
the
individual
customers
of
the
grocery
store,
the
department
store
have
any
connection.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
under
the
act,
they
are
not
merely
the
employee
of
these
small
businesses.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
that
the
act
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
even
if
we
were
to
agree
arguendo
that
arnheim
was
not
the
employer.
the
act
does
not
speak
about
being
employed
by
an
enterprise.
it
says
being
employed
in
an
enterprise.
now
arnheim
has
an
enterprise.
i
don’t
see
how
anybody
can
deny
that
arnheim
has
a
business
which
is
managing
office
and
apartment
buildings
for
others.
i
don’t
see
how
anybody
can
deny
that
these
persons
are
employed
in
arnheim’s
business.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
it
would
depend
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
you
might
find
that
these
were
not
related
activities.
the
question
would
be,
is
there
management
of
the
small
grocery
store
or
related
activity
to
their
management
of
the
world
trade
center
and
the
point
in
the
legislative
history,
congress
said,
suppose
you
have
a
one
company
which
is
engaged
in
the
retail
apparel
business
and
also
the
lumbering
business.
now,
congress
said,
this
is
what
we
mean
by
activities
that
are
not
related.
you
would
not
consider
the
revenues
of
the
lumbering
business
in
determining
the
enterprise
of
the
apparel
business
nor
would
the
lumbering
business
employees
be
covered.
now,
this
concept
that
you
have
to
have
more
than
one
owner
that
the
word
“common”
requires
more
than
one,
leads
to
the
result
that
general
motors
is
not
covered
under
the
act.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
we
would
submit
to
begin
with
is
clearly
an
issue
that
is
not
before
this
court
because
it
would
have
require
to
completely
different
kind
of
hearing
on
remand
from
the
kind
of
the
court
of
appeals
order
but
to
the
extent
that
this
--
that
the
court
wants
to
reach
it.
a
situation
is
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don’t
believe
that
the
issue
is
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
was
no
cross-petition.
in
the
mills
versus
electric
auto-light
case
which
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely
it
was
urged
in
the
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
--
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
it
doesn’t
support
the
judgment
below
which
is
a
remand
for
a
particular
type
of
hearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
our
favor
on
this
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
said
you
look
at
gross
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
overall
result
was
that
they
decided
in
our
favor
on
two
of
the
three
issues
they
considered
and
against
us
on
the
third.
now,
the
actual
effect
of
that
putting
it
into
practice
is
that
many
of
the
employees
whom
--
for
whom
we
seek
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
act
would
not
get
that
protection.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
none
of
them.
that
would
depend
upon
the
revenues
of
each
of
the
--
under
the
third
circuit’s
theory,
you
would
go
back
to
the
district
court,
you
would
look
for
year
subsequent
to
1967
at
the
revenues
of
each
individual
building.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
only
for
1964.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
an
association
between
these
employees
and
arnheim
and
neely’s
enterprise.
it
is
certainly
what
the
act
provides.
that
is
if
the
building
owners
chose
to
run
their
own
buildings
and
not
have
the
benefit
of
retaining
an
expert
large
real
estate
management
company
to
do
it,
then
they
would
possibly
not
have
to
the
pay
the
minimum
wage.
although
the
stipulation
at
page
21
indicates
that
one
of
these
buildings,
the
clark
building
had
$800,000
in
rentals
in
1964.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
that’s
not
the
only
context
in
which
that
comes
up.
that
is
the
least
department
example.
if
i
operate
a
beauty
parlor
and
i
may
have
a
very
small
business.
but
if
i
want
to
go
and
put
that
beauty
parlor
in
woodward
and
lothrop,
as
part
of
the
woodward
and
lothrop
department
store
and
lease
space
for
them
to
do
that,
i
then
have
to
pay
my
people
the
minimum
wage
because
they
are
then
employed
in
woodward
and
lothrop’s
enterprise.
that
just
is
the
way
congress
structured
this
act
and
i
think
there
is
no
way
to
escape
the
clear
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
we
--
our
case
in
no
way
depends
on
establishing
any
relationship
between
the
building
owners.
it
said
--
they
simply
--
when
they
go
in
arnheim
and
neely
and
arnheim
and
neely
goes
out
and
retains
john
doe
to
operate,
it
hires
john
doe
to
operate
the
elevator
at
the
building
subject
to
whatever
approval
or
role
the
building
owner
may
pay
and
setting
his
salary
and
so
on.
it’s
arnheim
who
he
comes
to.
it’s
arnheim
who
he
submits
his
reference
to
objects
them
out.
it’s
arnheim
with
whom
he
deals
on
a
day
to
day
basis.
it’s
arnheim
that
supervises
his
work.
now,
he’s
working
in
arnheim’s
enterprise
and
that’s
what
congress
said
was
determinative
of
whether
he
is
entitled
to
be
paid
the
minimum
wage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
perhaps
so.
but
i
think
that
it’s
not
--
i
am
not
just
bootstrapping
myself
because
i
think
that
arnheim’s
enterprise
is
the
management
of
these
buildings.
and
they
can’t
manage
these
buildings
without
these
employees.
and
it’s
for
that
reason
that
i
say
that
these
employees
are
necessarily
involved
in
arnheim’s
enterprise.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
what
i
am
saying
in
the
beauty
parlor
example
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
that
the
beauty
parlor
operator
may
not
have
an
enterprise,
yet
he
--
and
woodward
and
lothrop
on
the
other
hand
may
not
be
the
employer
of
these
people
who
work
in
the
beauty
parlor
at
all.
and
woodward
and
lothrop
may
have
no
liability
to
pay
the
minimum
wage.
but
they
are
protected
by
the
minimum
wage
laws
because
they
are
in
woodward
and
lothrop’s
enterprise
and
the
beauty
parlor
operator
small
business,
though
it
be
has
to
pay
them
the
minimum
wage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
holding
an
elevator
operators,
cleaning
ladies,
and
other
operating
maintenance
and
personnel
at
eight
office
buildings
and
one
apartment
complex
in
the
pittsburgh
area,
managed
by
respondent
arnheim
and
neely,
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act’
minimum
wage
and
overtime
provisions.
the
decision
below
conflicts
with
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
involving
identical
issues
and
holding
that
the
employees
were
covered.
arnheim
is
a
real
estate
firm
engaged
among
other
activities
in
the
management
of
office
buildings
and
apartment
houses
as
agents
for
the
owners
of
such
buildings.
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought,
it
managed
a
total
of
nine
such
buildings
for
various
unrelated
owners.
arnheim’s
management
activities
are
carried
out
under
basically
identical
contracts
with
each
of
the
building
owners.
under
which
arnheim
assumes
all
of
the
functions
of
managing
and
operating
the
buildings
including
the
procurement
of
tenants
and
negotiation
and
enforcement
of
leases,
the
collection
of
rents,
arrangement
for
utilities
and
other
services,
in
short
all
aspects
of
the
operation
of
the
buildings.
now
arnheim’s
business
is
conducted
from
its
central
office
and
managed
by
supervisory
management
personnel
operating
out
of
that
central
office.
with
respect
to
each
building,
arnheim
collects
the
rents,
deposits
them
in
separate
bank
accounts
and
uses
the
funds
to
pay
the
operating
expenses
of
the
buildings
to
pay
its
commissions
and
to
remit
the
balance
to
the
owners.
now,
arnheim
has
extensive
responsibilities
in
connection
with
personnel
employed
at
the
various
buildings
and
i
am
talking
about
such
personnel
as
elevator
operators,
cleaning
ladies,
watchmen,
building
engineers
and
so
on.
functions
and
responsibilities
of
arnheim
with
respect
to
these
personnel
are
spelled
out
in
detail
in
the
stipulation
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
and
that’s
in
the
appendix
and
also
at
pages
5
and
6
of
our
brief.
now
briefly
summarized,
these
functions
involved
hiring,
promotion,
and
firing
of
all
personnel;
supervision
of
their
performance
of
their
employment,
making
work
assignments
and
scheduling
the
time
of
work,
negotiating
union
contracts,
determining
rates
of
pay
and
benefits,
preparing
payroll
and
maintenance
of
other
employee
records
and
payment
of
salaries.
in
short,
every
conceivable
incident
of
the
employer-employee
relationship
is
encompassed
in
arnheim’s
responsibility,
although
the
owners
are
consulted
and
enjoy
of
veto
with
respect
to
certain
matters
such
as
the
rates
of
pay
and
promotions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don’t
believe
that
in
this
--
that
the
record
reflects
that
they
are
shifted.
they
are
employed
for
a
particular
building.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
relationship
of
employer
and
employee.
our
position
is
and
i
think
this
court
has
clearly
held
certainly
in
the
context
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
in
determining
the
employer-employee
relationship,
you
don’t
look
solely
at
the
common
law
concepts
and
you
don’t
--
and
in
any
event
even
if
you
did
the
right
to
hire,
the
right
to
fire
even
if
it
is
a
shared
responsibility
with
another
person
gives
you
a
status
as
an
employer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
a
separate
bank
account.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
by
arnheim
and
neely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
isn’t
arnheim
and
neely
account,
it
would
be
labeled
arnheim
and
neely
clock
building
accounts.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
record
doesn’t
indicate
that
that
arises.
our
position
in
such
an
instance,
suppose
the
building
owner
went
bankrupt
and
--
i
will
come
this
a
little
later.
our
position
would
be
that
arnheim
would
be
responsible
for
payment
of
minimum
wages
then
arnheim
is
under
the
act
of
employer
in
that
sense.
and
it
has
every
power
that
an
employer
has.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
our
position.
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
essential
for
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
their
responsibility
to
pay
the
light
bill
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law
and
of
contract
between
them
and
the
building
owner
but
here
we
have
a
special
situation
which
is
that
they
do
serve
as
employers
of
these
people
under
the
act
and
if
these
people
are
entitled
to
the
acts
protection,
then
the
employer
is
reliable
to
see
that
they
get
it.
and
as
both
arnheim
in
this
case
and
the
building
owners
and
i
will
expand
on
this
shortly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct
your
honor.
again
later
on,
i
think
i
will
indicate
that
there
is
an
argument
that’s
made
that
this
is
somehow
still
relevant
to
the
enterprise
question
which
is
really
before
the
court
today
but
we
think
that
argument
is
fallacious.
now,
the
secretary
of
labor
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
to
compel
arnheim
and
neely,
to
comply
with
the
minimum
wage,
the
overtime
and
the
record-keeping
provisions
of
the
act.
arnheim
raised
basically
four
defenses.
first,
it
contended
that
it
was
not
the
employer
of
these
employees
that
the
building
owner
was.
the
district
court
rejected
that
contention,
it
looks
both
that
the
relationship
in
arnheim
actually
had
to
these
employees
and
to
the
definition
in
the
act
on
how
that
it
was
an
employer.
secondly,
arnheim
contended
that
that
in
determining
whether
the
dollar
volume
requirements
of
the
act
are
met,
the
court
should
consider
only
arnheim’s
commissions
and
not
the
gross
rents
from
the
buildings.
this
argument
too
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
thirdly
and
this
is
the
key
issue
in
this
case
today,
arnheim
contended
that
its
business
was
not
an
enterprise
under
the
act
but
rather
that
the
employees
at
these
buildings
were
employed
and
its
many
different
enterprises
as
there
were
separate
building
owners.
finally,
an
issue
that
is
not
raised
by
either
side
here,
there
was
an
issue
regarding
the
nexus
to
interstate
commerce
and
the
district
court
held
that
prior
to
february
1,
1967,
the
necessary
nexus
did
not
exist
and
dismissed
the
secretary
suit
as
to
that
prior
period
subsequent
to
february
1,
1967
when
the
statute
was
amended.
the
court
held
that
the
necessary
nexus
did
exist
and
we
don’t
understand
that
issue
to
be
contested.
on
appeal,
the
third
circuit
held
an
agreement
with
the
government’s
position
on
the
district
court
that
arnheim
is
an
employer
of
these
employees
under
the
act.
it
secondly
held
also
an
agreement
with
the
government
and
with
the
district
court
that
the
proper
measure
of
gross
revenues
for
purposes
of
determining
coverage
under
section
3
(s)
of
the
act
is
rents
and
not
merely
arnheim’s
commissions.
however,
they
agreed
with
arnheim
that
it
was
not
conducting
a
single
enterprise
but
rather
as
many
different
enterprises
as
they
were
different
building
owners.
accordingly,
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
whether
each
of
these,
whether
any
of
these
separate
enterprises
met
the
dollar
volume
requirements
of
the
act
to
create
an
enterprise
in
which
the
employees
would
be
covered.
our
petition
for
certiorari
raised
solely
the
issue
of
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals
definition
of
arnheim’s
enterprise.
no
cross-petition
was
filed
with
respect
to
the
issues
won
by
the
government
below
nor
were
they
raise
in
the
brief
in
our
position
to
the
certiorari
petition.
turning
to
the
merits,
the
government’s
theory
is
that
these
employees
are
employed
in
arnheim
and
neely’s
enterprise,
the
management
of
office
and
apartment
buildings
for
others
and
that
the
activities
that
all
the
buildings
arnheim
manages
are
part
of
a
single
enterprise.
question
presented
to
this
court
is
fundamentally
one
of
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
we
submit
these
provisions
are
acceptable
of
only
one
interpretation
and
that
interpretation
provides
coverage
for
these
employees.
let’s
take
john
doe,
an
elevator
operator
of
one
of
the
buildings
that
arnheim
manages,
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
is
protected
by
the
minimum
wage
provisions
which
it
contained
in
section
6
of
the
act
would
begin
by
looking
at
section
6
which
says
every
employer
shall
pay
to
each
of
his
employees
and
i
am
skipping
to
the
relevant
part,
employed
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
wages
at
certain
rates.
now
the
phrase
“engaged
in
the
--employed
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce
or
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce”
is
defined
in
section
3
(s).
its
there
defined
as
an
enterprise
whose
annual
gross
volume
of
sales
made
or
business
done
is
not
less
than
$500,000
if
we
are
talking
about
the
period
from
february
1967
to
january
1969.
so
the
question
is,
is
john
doe
employed
in
an
enterprise
which
has
the
necessary
dollar
volumes?
now
“enterprise”
as
defined
in
section
3
(r)
and
here
we
are
the
crux
of
the
case.
the
relevant
portion
says
that
an
enterprise
means
“the
related
activities
performed
either
through
unified
operation
or
common
control
by
any
person
or
persons
for
a
common
business
purpose,
and
includes
all
such
activities
whether
performed
in
one
or
more
establishments
or
by
one
or
more
corporate
or
other
organizational
units.”
now
arnheim’s
activities
as
a
manager
of
office
and
apartment
buildings
for
others
clearly
constitute
a
single
enterprise
under
this
definition.
there
are
three
elements
that
need
to
be
met.
are
they
related
activities?
and
congress
has
not
defined
related
activities
per
se
but
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
consider
related
activities
to
be
those
that
are
the
same
or
similar.
looking
in
arnheim’s
activities
that
each
of
the
office
buildings
and
apartment
buildings
that
have
manages,
it
does
the
same
thing
under
basically
the
same
agreement
with
the
building
owner
clearly
related
activities
we
submit.
the
second
requirement
is,
are
these
activities
performed
through
a
unified
operation
or
common
control?
now,
the
common
control
requirement
is
satisfied
if
they’re
performed
by
a
single
company.
arnheim
and
neely
incorporated
runs
the
business
of
arnheim
and
neely,
incorporated
and
that’s
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
the
common
control
requirement
is
met.
in
addition,
although
it’s
not
necessary
to
meet
both,
arnheim’s
business
of
managing
buildings
is
run
through
unified
operations.
that
is
out
of
its
central
arnheim
and
neely
office
where
its
management
and
supervisory
personnel
and
clerical
personnel
work.
finally,
these
related
activities
must
be
engaged
in,
for
a
common
business
purpose.
again,
we
think
it’s
clear
that
the
requirement
is
met.
the
emphasis
of
congress
was
on
the
word
“business”
to
distinguish
between
business
and
charitable.
here,
the
activities
that
each
of
the
nine
buildings
are
undertaken
by
arnheim
for
its
business
purpose
of
managing
buildings
and
making
a
profit
from
that
activity.
how
then
did
the
court
of
appeals
reach
a
different
conclusion?
it
did
so
by
completely
ignoring
arnheim’s
enterprise
and
by
looking
instead
at
arnheim’s
clients
the
building
owners.
it
found
that
the
building
owners
did
not
share
common
business
purpose
that
they
have
nine
distinct
enterprises.
this
finding
was
absolutely
correct.
we
have
no
problem
with
it,
whatsoever.
but
it’s
irrelevant
as
applied
to
this
case
because
it’s
arnheim’s
enterprise
in
which
we
contend
that
these
individuals
are
employed.
now,
there
is
a
fact
which
is
perhaps
overlooked
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
respondents
herein
which
is
that
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
it’s
possible
to
be
employed
in
more
than
one
enterprise
at
the
same
time.
and
indeed
that’s
exactly
what
appears
to
have
happened
here.
these
persons
are
employed
in
the
building
owners
enterprise
which
is
to
own
real
estate.
they
are
employed
in
arnheim
and
neely’s
enterprise
which
is
to
manage
real
estate.
they
are
involved
in
both
of
those
businesses.
now,
where
they
are
employed
by
more
than
one
enterprise,
if
one
of
the
enterprises
comes
within
the
coverage
requirements
of
section
3
(s)
then
the
employee
is
protected
regardless
of
whether
the
other
enterprise
by
which
he
may
also
be
employed
comes
within
section
3
(s)
or
not.
now,
i
think
the
example
that
we
gave
in
our
reply
brief
of
the
warehouses
retaining
the
protective
agency
will
illustrate
the
fallacy
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
supposed
you
have
nine
separate
warehouses,
each
completely
independent
business
having
no
connection
with
one
another.
they
all
require
security
services,
night
watchmen,
they
all
retain
the
same
protection
agency
and
the
issue
is,
are
these
night
watchmen
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act?
now
of
course
if
you
look
at
the
enterprises
of
the
warehouses
in
which
they
may
be
employed,
their
station
let
us
say
at
the
same
warehouse
every
night
that
they
were.
you
might
say
“well,
the
warehouse
doesn’t
have
an
enterprise
that
fits
the
statutory
requirement,
therefore
they
are
not
covered.
but
of
course
they
are
also
employed
in
the
protection
agencies
enterprise
which
is
to
provide
night
watchmen
and
various
warehouses
and
other
business
as
there
in
the
city.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
structure
of
the
act
makes
it
quite
clear
that
coverage
does
not
turn
on
who
is
responsible
for
your
wages.
the
question
is
“are
you
employed
in
an
enterprise?”
which
comes
within
the
definition.
now,
how
could
one
say
that
these
elevator
operators
are
not
employed
in
arnheim’s
enterprise?
arnheim’s
enterprise
is
to
operate
buildings
and
these
--
without
the
elevator
operators,
arnheim
couldn’t
conduct
its
business
in
managing
these
buildings.
and
therefore
these
men
are
employed
in
arnheim’s
enterprise
and
it
doesn’t
matter
whose
employees
they
are.
it
doesn’t
matter
who
pays
them.
now,
the
redcap
cases
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
are
an
illustration
of
a
situation
in
which
the
court
has
held
that
even
though
the
railway
company
is
not
paying
the
redcaps
their
salary,
they
are
totally
dependent
upon
tips
from
the
passengers
that
it
isn’t
payment
of
salary
who
bears
the
ultimate
salary
burden.
that’s
the
critical
issue.
the
issue
is,
who
has
control
over
the
day
to
day
conduct
of
these
employees?
are
they
involved
in
the
aircraft?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondents
or
perhaps
by
the
amicus,
i
think
it’s
the
royal
crown
case
involves
the
situation
where
the
president
of
a
company
was
held
personally
liable
under
the
act
because
of
the
extent
of
his
involvement.
but
here,
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
point.
the
plant
manager
would
not
be
considered
to
have
an
enterprise.
we
are
talking
about
whose
enterprise
to
these
people
working.
are
they
working
in
an
enterprise
which
is
covered
under
the
act?
now,
it
would
be
possible
that
they
could
work
in
an
enterprise
and
the
operator
of
that
enterprise
would
not
be
liable
for
their
wages
and
the
example
of
that
would
be
the
beauty
salon
operating
as
leasing
space
in
a
department
store.
now,
the
employees
of
that
beauty
salon,
if
the
department
store’s
enterprise
qualified
under
the
act,
the
revenues
of
the
beauty
salon
would
be
included
within
the
department
stores
enterprise
to
determine
whether
it
was
subject
to
the
act
and
the
employees
in
the
beauty
salon
would
be
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
at
even
though
the
department
store
exercise,
no
control
whatsoever
over
them.
the
department
store
might
have
no
liability
to
pay
the
minimum
wages.
the
beauty
salon
operator
who
does
not
have
an
enterprise
with
$500,000
would
be
liable
to
pay
because
these
persons
are
employed
in
an
enterprise
which
meets
the
acts
requirements.
and
this
is
a
very
important
point
that
that
is
overlooked
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondents
in
the
amicus.
now,
i
think
i
was
just
getting
to
this
point
actually
and
i
think
perhaps
i’ve
adequately
covered
it.
so,
in
closing,
let
me
say
this,
it
seems
clear
that
the
underpinnings
of
the
third
circuits
decision
was
a
concern
for
the
impact
of
the
minimum
wage
laws
on
the
business
of
the
building
owners.
now,
it
is
of
course
an
inevitable
feature
of
such
laws
that
they
raise
the
cost
of
certain
goods
and
services
and
thereby
adversely
affect
the
consumers
of
those
goods
and
services,
many
of
whom
maybe
small
businesses.
this
is
never
in
the
past
in
anyway
discouraged
congress
from
adopting
and
from
expending
the
coverage
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
any
event,
the
concern
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
these
building
owners
seems
to
us
misplaced
in
this
instance.
it’s
by
retaining
a
firm
such
as
arnheim
and
neely
to
manage
its
buildings
but
the
building
owners
realize
important
benefits
of
an
economic
nature
for
themselves.
these
benefits
derive
from
the
skill
of
arnheim’s
operation
from
the
fact
that
it
manages
many
buildings
that
it
is
able
to
hire
for
instance
experienced
top
management
personnel
to
manage
office
buildings
which
wouldn’t
be
justified
if
only
a
single
office
building
were
being
managed
so
that
substantial
benefits
are
being
conferred
upon
the
building
owners
when
they
retain
arnheim
and
this
notion
that
if
they
have
to
pay
the
minimum
wages,
they
will
all
stop
retaining
real
estate
management
firms
is
totally
without
foundation
in
the
record
and
we
believe
contrary
to
normal
experience.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
certain
who
was
the
owner.
i
believe
that
it’s
in
arnheim’s
name,
i
assume
that
it
is
a
trust
at
least
that
is
in
our
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statutory
issue
with
which
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
question
is,
are
they
employed
in
an
enterprise
and
looking
at
arnheim
and
neely.
what
is
arnheim
and
neely’s
are
their
activities
at
each
of
these
nine
buildings,
part
of
one
single
enterprise?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
certain
your
honor
where
that
would
rest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
workman’s
compensation
law
would
be
governed
in
part
by
the
state
law.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
question
is,
what
does
that
act
mean?
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
but
i
believe
that
it’s
possible
to
totally
ignore
the
relationship
between
the
building
owners
and
arnheim.
the
relationship
with
which
we
are
concerned
is
between
arnheim
and
the
business
that
arnheim
is
conducting
and
secondly
between
arnheim
and
this
personnel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don’t
mean
to
suggest
that
in
the
burns
illustration,
i
didn’t
mean
necessarily
that
the
protective
agency
would
hire
these
people.
they
could
be
joint
employers
and
i
think
it’s
very
important
that
in
this
case,
the
agreement
between
arnheim
and
the
building
owner
could
be
setup
in
such
a
way
that
arnheim
would
not
be
liable
under
the
act.
arnheim
can
simply
get
out
of
the
business
of
running
these
buildings
with
these
personnel
and
leave
that
to
the
building
owner.
it
could
stick
to
collection
of
rents
and
procurement
of
tenants
and
handling
the
bank
account
for
the
building
let’s
say.
if
it
did
that,
then
these
employees
would
no
longer
be
employed
in
arnheim’s
enterprise
and
we
would
not
be
seeking
to
establish
arnheim’s
liability.
by
that
same
token,
the
building
owners
can
get
out
of
liability
under
the
act
by
withdrawing
any
of
their
employment
control.
that
is,
they
could
leave
it
up
to
arnheim
to
pay
whatever
salary
arnheim
wants
and
just
reimburse
arnheim
on
a
cost
plus
basis
for
doing
that.
and
such
a
case
which
would
be
irrelatively
minor
change
in
the
existing
agreement,
the
building
owners
would
be
off
to
hook
as
far
as
liability
for
payment
of
minimum
wages
and
for
making
sure
that
the
necessary
records
are
kept
and
so
on,
that
would
all
be
arnheim.
in
this
case,
they
have
chosen
to
setup
their
relationship
in
a
manner
that
makes
them
both
liable
because
they
are
both
--
because
these
persons
are
employed
in
both
of
their
enterprises
and
they
are
both
employers
under
the
definition
of
the
act
which
both
courts
below
have
held.
now,
i
think
when
we
are
talking
about
the
policy
that
informs
and
underlies
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
there
are
numerous
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
this
policy
and
i
want
to
refer
to
one
in
the
house
report
in
connection
with
the
1966
amendments
to
the
act.
the
committee
said,
in
keeping
with
the
broad
statutory
definitions
of
the
“coverage”
phrase
is
used.
the
courts
have
repeatedly
expressed
and
adhere
to
the
principle
that
the
coverage
phrases
should
receive
a
liberal
interpretation
consonant
with
the
definitions
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
with
its
character
as
remedial
and
humanitarian
legislation.
however,
despite
the
acts
broad
coverage
terms
and
the
court’s
liberal
interpretations
regarding
coverage
and
restrictive
interpretations
regarding
exemptions,
there
is
great
need
for
extending
the
present
coverage
of
the
act
to
large
groups
of
workers
whose
earnings
today
are
unjustifiably
and
disproportionably
low.
now,
it’s
that
policy
and
not
any
concern
for
small
business
man
that
as
a
basic
policy
that
underlies
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
given
that
policy,
there
is
no
reason
to
ignore
or
distort
the
clear
statutory
language
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
these
employees
from
obtaining
the
benefits
of
the
act.
if
there
are
not
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
sir.
first
with
respect
to
mr.
seamans’
comments,
i
think
he
misses
a
fundamental
point.
it’s
not
the
building
owners
that
are
subject
to
the
act
or
covered
by
the
act.
it’s
the
employees
that
are
covered
by
the
act.
the
issue
is,
are
these
employees
in
an
enterprise?
not
are
these
building
owners
covered
by
the
act?
well,
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
congress
intended
that
employees
who
were
employed
in
an
enterprise
--
who
are
not
employed
in
an
enterprise
of
a
certain
size
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
it’s
entirely
possible
that
you
could
have
two
buildings,
one
small
and
independently
operated
where
the
only
enterprise
is
under
$500,000
and
one
along
side
that’s
larger
where
the
enterprise
were
either
the
office
building
itself
has
enough
revenues
to
come
within
there.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
no
matter
how
you
structured
it
unless
you
just
made
it
applicable
across
the
board
to
all
employees,
there
would
be
some
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
congress.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
congress
felt
that
in
--
where
you
were
dealing
with
what
say
the
mom
and
pop
grocery
store.
that
the
impact
on
commerce
was
relatively
limited
from
such
an
enterprise
and
that
congress
would
give
them
a
break,
these
vary
small
business.
now,
arnheim
and
neely
is
not
such
a
business.
this
is
not
a
mom
and
pop
store.
and
of
course
they
keep
trying
to
talk
about
the
building
owners
as
the
one
arnheim
and
neely
had
no
business.
for
instance,
they
say
an
enterprise
must
have
an
ownership.
well,
there
is
ownership
here.
arnheim
and
neely
owns
arnheim
and
neely.
and
it
conducts
the
enterprise
of
arnheim
and
neely.
that’s
the
sense,
the
only
sense
in
which
ownership
is
required.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
it
was
held
that
these
are
their
employees.
that’s
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
would
not
make
any
distinction
on
the
basis
of
whether
any
particular
ones
of
the
buildings
that
were
managed
happened
to
meet
the
dollar
limit.
what
we
would
say
is,
is
he
conducting
an
enterprise?
if
his
enterprise
may
for
instance
the
doctor-patient
example
used
in
the
respondent’s
brief.
i
think
highlights
this
point
clearly.
they
say,
well
the
patients,
each
come
to
the
doctor
and
the
patient
are
unrelated
to
one
another.
the
patients
are
not
engaging
in
related
activities.
they
have
no
common
health
purpose
when
they
come
to
the
doctor,
therefore,
how
could
you
say
that
there
would
be
an
enterprise.
well,
the
doctor
is
engaged
in
a
common
business
purpose.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
look
at
the
way
in
which
--
i
would
look
at
the
activities
that
he
undertakes
and
i
would
look
to
see
whether
they
are
related
activities.
whether
they
are
conducted
through
unified
operation
and
common
control
and
whether
they
are
conducted
for
common
business
purpose.
if
i
found
all
those
things
then
i
would
say
yes.
he
is
an
enterprise
under
the
act
regardless
whether
the
individual
pieces
of
his
business.
the
individual
customers
of
the
grocery
store,
the
department
store
have
any
connection.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
under
the
act,
they
are
not
merely
the
employee
of
these
small
businesses.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
that
the
act
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
even
if
we
were
to
agree
arguendo
that
arnheim
was
not
the
employer.
the
act
does
not
speak
about
being
employed
by
an
enterprise.
it
says
being
employed
in
an
enterprise.
now
arnheim
has
an
enterprise.
i
don’t
see
how
anybody
can
deny
that
arnheim
has
a
business
which
is
managing
office
and
apartment
buildings
for
others.
i
don’t
see
how
anybody
can
deny
that
these
persons
are
employed
in
arnheim’s
business.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
it
would
depend
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
you
might
find
that
these
were
not
related
activities.
the
question
would
be,
is
there
management
of
the
small
grocery
store
or
related
activity
to
their
management
of
the
world
trade
center
and
the
point
in
the
legislative
history,
congress
said,
suppose
you
have
a
one
company
which
is
engaged
in
the
retail
apparel
business
and
also
the
lumbering
business.
now,
congress
said,
this
is
what
we
mean
by
activities
that
are
not
related.
you
would
not
consider
the
revenues
of
the
lumbering
business
in
determining
the
enterprise
of
the
apparel
business
nor
would
the
lumbering
business
employees
be
covered.
now,
this
concept
that
you
have
to
have
more
than
one
owner
that
the
word
“common”
requires
more
than
one,
leads
to
the
result
that
general
motors
is
not
covered
under
the
act.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
we
would
submit
to
begin
with
is
clearly
an
issue
that
is
not
before
this
court
because
it
would
have
require
to
completely
different
kind
of
hearing
on
remand
from
the
kind
of
the
court
of
appeals
order
but
to
the
extent
that
this
--
that
the
court
wants
to
reach
it.
a
situation
is
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don’t
believe
that
the
issue
is
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
was
no
cross-petition.
in
the
mills
versus
electric
auto-light
case
which
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely
it
was
urged
in
the
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
--
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
it
doesn’t
support
the
judgment
below
which
is
a
remand
for
a
particular
type
of
hearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
our
favor
on
this
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
said
you
look
at
gross
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
overall
result
was
that
they
decided
in
our
favor
on
two
of
the
three
issues
they
considered
and
against
us
on
the
third.
now,
the
actual
effect
of
that
putting
it
into
practice
is
that
many
of
the
employees
whom
--
for
whom
we
seek
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
act
would
not
get
that
protection.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
none
of
them.
that
would
depend
upon
the
revenues
of
each
of
the
--
under
the
third
circuit’s
theory,
you
would
go
back
to
the
district
court,
you
would
look
for
year
subsequent
to
1967
at
the
revenues
of
each
individual
building.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
only
for
1964.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
an
association
between
these
employees
and
arnheim
and
neely’s
enterprise.
it
is
certainly
what
the
act
provides.
that
is
if
the
building
owners
chose
to
run
their
own
buildings
and
not
have
the
benefit
of
retaining
an
expert
large
real
estate
management
company
to
do
it,
then
they
would
possibly
not
have
to
the
pay
the
minimum
wage.
although
the
stipulation
at
page
21
indicates
that
one
of
these
buildings,
the
clark
building
had
$800,000
in
rentals
in
1964.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
that’s
not
the
only
context
in
which
that
comes
up.
that
is
the
least
department
example.
if
i
operate
a
beauty
parlor
and
i
may
have
a
very
small
business.
but
if
i
want
to
go
and
put
that
beauty
parlor
in
woodward
and
lothrop,
as
part
of
the
woodward
and
lothrop
department
store
and
lease
space
for
them
to
do
that,
i
then
have
to
pay
my
people
the
minimum
wage
because
they
are
then
employed
in
woodward
and
lothrop’s
enterprise.
that
just
is
the
way
congress
structured
this
act
and
i
think
there
is
no
way
to
escape
the
clear
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
we
--
our
case
in
no
way
depends
on
establishing
any
relationship
between
the
building
owners.
it
said
--
they
simply
--
when
they
go
in
arnheim
and
neely
and
arnheim
and
neely
goes
out
and
retains
john
doe
to
operate,
it
hires
john
doe
to
operate
the
elevator
at
the
building
subject
to
whatever
approval
or
role
the
building
owner
may
pay
and
setting
his
salary
and
so
on.
it’s
arnheim
who
he
comes
to.
it’s
arnheim
who
he
submits
his
reference
to
objects
them
out.
it’s
arnheim
with
whom
he
deals
on
a
day
to
day
basis.
it’s
arnheim
that
supervises
his
work.
now,
he’s
working
in
arnheim’s
enterprise
and
that’s
what
congress
said
was
determinative
of
whether
he
is
entitled
to
be
paid
the
minimum
wage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
perhaps
so.
but
i
think
that
it’s
not
--
i
am
not
just
bootstrapping
myself
because
i
think
that
arnheim’s
enterprise
is
the
management
of
these
buildings.
and
they
can’t
manage
these
buildings
without
these
employees.
and
it’s
for
that
reason
that
i
say
that
these
employees
are
necessarily
involved
in
arnheim’s
enterprise.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
what
i
am
saying
in
the
beauty
parlor
example
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
that
the
beauty
parlor
operator
may
not
have
an
enterprise,
yet
he
--
and
woodward
and
lothrop
on
the
other
hand
may
not
be
the
employer
of
these
people
who
work
in
the
beauty
parlor
at
all.
and
woodward
and
lothrop
may
have
no
liability
to
pay
the
minimum
wage.
but
they
are
protected
by
the
minimum
wage
laws
because
they
are
in
woodward
and
lothrop’s
enterprise
and
the
beauty
parlor
operator
small
business,
though
it
be
has
to
pay
them
the
minimum
wage.
