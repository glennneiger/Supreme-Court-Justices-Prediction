mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
first
would
like
to
answer
the
court’s
question
respect
to
who
owns
the
bank
accounts
involved
in
this
case.
on
the
bottom
of
page
23
of
the
stipulation,
it
says
specifically
the
funds
deposited
in
these
accounts
for
the
property
of
the
owner
and
not
of
arnheim
and
neely.
and
arnheim
and
neely
is
not
liable
in
the
event
of
bankruptcy
or
failure
of
the
depositor.
there’s
no
question,
your
honors,
that
these
are
agency
accounts
and
that
arnheim
and
neely
would
not
be
liable
for
any
of
the
wages
personally
if
these
buildings
could
not
meet
the
payroll
itself.
now,
this
history
of
this
case
started
in
1965.
at
which
time,
one
of
the
labor
department
representatives
came
in
to
arnheim
and
neely’s
quarters
to
examine
the
operation,
decided
that
arnheim
and
neely
was
an
enterprise
and
we
have
been
on
the
road
ever
since.
when
we
reach
the
litigation
stage
in
1967,
we
knew
that
we
were
guinea
pig
and
that
we
were
the
first
to
be
hit
with
the
suit
by
an
agent
who
had
no
ownership
in
any
of
the
buildings
which
it
managed.
because
of
the
importance
to
the
industry,
the
instituted
real
estate
management
asked
to
leave
to
intervene
as
a
party
defendant
and
was
given
that
permission.
we
lost
the
first
trial
in
the
federal
court
in
pennsylvania.
shortly
after
our
case
came
down,
a
similar
case
was
started
by
the
federal
government
in
the
district
court
of
virginia.
and
despite
the
holding
against
us,
the
district
court
of
virginia
decided
in
favor
of
the
real
estate
managing.
in
that
case,
they
made
a
threshold
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
measure
should
be
gross
receipts
or
gross
commissions
and
they
held
it
should
be
gross
commissions
because
the
real
estate
manager
didn’t
own
any
of
the
gross
receipts
themselves.
so
we
went
into
the
circuit
court
in
the
third
circuit
feeling
pretty
good
that
the
--
at
least
we
had
one
case
in
our
favor
namely
the
virginia
case.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that
was
the
district
court.
right.
prior
to
the
argument
in
the
third
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
got
ahead
of
use
and
decided
and
reversed
the
lower
court
in
virginia.
so
then
the
government
came
in
to
the
argument
and
said
we
got
a
pretty
good
case
also.
despite
the
fourth
circuit
case
and
the
lower
court
case
in
its
own
district,
the
third
circuit
decided
that
arnheim
and
neely
was
not
an
enterprise.
in
a
very
well-reasoned
opinion,
concise,
logical
and
i
may
be
a
little
prejudice
but
i
still
say
it’s
that.
i
don’t
have
to
go
in
to
detail
as
to
the
nature
of
arnheim
and
neely’s
activities,
it’s
already
been
discussed.
there
are
many
unusual
type
of
activities
than
usual
type
of
management
activities.
but
there
is
one
point,
your
honors
that
i
have
to
make
clear
and
emphasize.
arnheim
and
neely
does
not
own
any
of
the
buildings
in
which
it
manages.
they
are
just
no
ownership
present,
that’s
all.
every
case
of
enterprise
must
have
some
type
of
ownership
going
with
it.
and
they
don’t
have
any
ownership
here.
also
in
discussing
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well
i’m
coming
to
that
your
honor,
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
think
almost
it
is
your
honor.
i
really
think
that
in
order
to
show
an
enterprise
that
you
have
to
show
some
ownership.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
security
guards
may
or
may
not
be
an
enterprise
depending
on
whom
they
work
for.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
not
the
security
guards
your
honor.
of
course
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
i
may
have
been
misunderstood
but
i
say
that
the
enterprise
doctrine
itself
must
show
some
and
i
think
i
will
be
able
to
point
to
that
your
honors
little
more
clearly
that
the
enterprise
doctrine
must
contain
some
type
of
ownership
in
order
to
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
am
talking
about
title
to
the
receipts
which
they
receive
for
example,
the
gross
rentals
that
they
receive.
well,
let
me
continue
and
i
think
i
will
be
able
to
explain
it.
this
court
decided
back
in
1945,
the
case
of
10
east
40th
street
building
versus
callus.
that
case
involved
a
local
building
operation
and
because
of
that
decision,
the
court
held
that
the
employees
were
not
within
the
interstate
commerce
rule
and
it
was
a
part
--
simply
a
local
operation.
now,
we
have
here
nine
separate
buildings,
all
of
which
can
be
considered
to
be
callus
cases.
the
government
says,
well
since
that
case,
we
have
gone
into
the
enterprise
doctrine
and
therefore
that
case
doesn’t
hold
right.
of
course
the
case
is
still
being
cited
everyday
for
the
proposition
for
which
it
stands
and
the
crux
of
the
real
issue
here
is,
does
the
enterprise
doctrine
nullified
the
holding
of
the
callus
case.
so
we
are
back
again
to
the
definition
situation
as
to
what
is
an
enterprise.
and
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
stewart
deplored
the
exercise
in
semantics
in
the
maryland
versus
wirtz
case.
we
are
going
to
have
to
do
a
little
exercise
in
semantics,
nevertheless.
the
definition
states
related
activities
performed
either
through
unified
operation
or
common
control
by
any
person
or
persons
for
a
common
business
purpose.
the
word
“common”
appears
in
this
definition
twice
in
three
lines.
so,
i
must
assume
that
the
word
is
rather
important.
but
let’s
take
each
of
the
definition
words
as
it
goes
down.
first,
it
says
related.
what
are
related
activities?
well,
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
they
are
the
internal
activities
of
arnheim
and
neely
which
are
related.
well,
of
course
any
building
has
internal
activities
which
are
related
to
each
other.
this
is
not
what
the
congress
meant
your
honors.
the
related
activities
are
those
which
concern
more
than
one
business.
not
just
arnheim
and
neely
business
but
more
than
one
business
with
common
ownership.
lacking
the
common
ownership,
there
can
be
no
related
activity,
unified
operation
or
common
control.
well,
i
could
only
refer
to
those
activities
where
there
is
more
than
one
business.
naturally,
a
single
business
has
unified
operation
in
common
control
and
not
as
the
government
contends
to
a
single
operation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
common
control
may
not
even
be
enough.
a
recent
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
decided
since
out
case
called
university
club
tower
case
involved
a
situation
where
one
corporation
controlled
both
an
apartment
building
and
a
hotel.
and
the
court
said,
well
the
business
purpose
of
a
hotel
is
not
the
same
as
the
business
purpose
of
a
apartment
building,
therefore,
no
enterprise.
so,
i
submit
to
you
honors,
if
a
hotel
and
an
apartment
building
which
are
commonly
owned
and
controlled
are
not
an
enterprise,
how
can
there
be
an
enterprise
where
you
have
a
number
of
unrelated
buildings
merely
because
they
have
a
common
agent.
the
use
of
the
work
“common”
as
i
said
before
is
a
very
important
phrase
--
word.
when
you
talk
about
“common,”
you
talk
about
more
than
one.
even
the
definition
of
common
in
the
dictionary
says,
belonging
to,
or
equally
shared
by
two
or
more
individuals.
well
now,
i
know
that
learned
hand
once
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
make
forth
recite
a
dictionary
and
i’m
not
saying
that
we
should
in
this
case.”
but
nevertheless,
this
court
had
talking
to
mr.
justice
vinson
once
said,
“we
have
consistently
refused
to
pervert
the
process
of
interpretation
by
mechanically
applying
definitions
in
unattended
context
refused
to
pervert.”
those
are
strong
words
in
those
days
but
they
have
a
different
connotations
today
and
i
am
not
going
to
accuse
the
government
of
any
type
of
perversion
but
they
are
certainly
are
distorting
the
words
of
this
definition
of
enterprise.
“common,”
if
i
use
my
driveway
with
my
wife
and
family,
if
i
created
a
common
driveway?
of
course
not.
but
if
i
use
my
driveway
with
somebody
on
the
other
side
who
has
got
a
property
on
the
other
side,
then
i
have
created
something
in
common.
the
government,
however
says
because
arnheim
and
neely
is
operating
more
than
one
building,
it
is
in
common.
it’s
operating
with
itself
and
i
say
that
this
thus
doesn’t
mean
anything
as
far
as
definition
at
large
is
concern.
now,
i’ve
taken
the
definition
apart.
let’s
put
it
back
together
again.
what
is
an
enterprise?
well,
i
think
an
enterprise
is
demonstrated
mainly
by
the
so-called
bank
and
insurance
cases.
the
bank
owns
an
office
building.
it
uses
part
of
the
office
building
itself
and
it
rents
out
to
the
general
public
the
balance
of
the
building.
prior
to
the
institution
of
the
enterprise
doctrine,
the
bank
guard
was
subject
to
the
act
and
the
office
building
guard,
he
worked
along
side
with
him
was
not
subject
to
the
act.
and
to
correct
that,
congress
said,
if
you
are
in
an
enterprise
then
this
is
where
both
people
should
be
under
the
same
act
and
i
quite
agree.
but
that’s
not
the
situation
with
we
have.
in
that
case
again,
the
ownership
was
the
bank
who
own
the
office
building
and
that
i
said
your
honors
is
what
a
true
enterprise
really
is.
now,
there
was
some
discussion
when
the
honorable
solicitor
was
talking
about
some
of
the
economic
reality
and
situation
and
this
court
has
said
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
social
legislation
such
as
this,
we
must
look
at
the
economic
realities.
now,
what
are
the
economic
realities
with
respect
to
the
employees
of
these
separate
buildings?
first
place,
the
employees
go
with
the
building.
they
don’t
go
with
arnheim
and
neely.
since
the
case
has
been
instituted,
arnheim
and
neely
has
lost
the
management
of
some
of
these
buildings
that
are
mentioned
here.
they
gained
other
ones
and
there
is
a
continual
shifting
over
because
some
buildings
are
sold,
some
buildings
are
tired
of
the
manager,
they
want
a
new
manager
for
one
reason
or
another
that
buildings
are
no
longer
managed
by
arnheim
and
neely.
the
employees
stay
with
the
building,
they
don’t
go
with
arnheim
and
neely.
the
rates
are
paid,
the
fringe
benefits,
other
wage
and
salary
matters
all
are
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
owner
without
exception.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
don’t
think
it’s
in
the
stipulation
your
honor,
probably
this
wasn’t
thought
about
with
respect
to
talking
about
the
minimum
wage,
we
are
talking
about
workmen’s
compensation
but
i
think
there
is
enough
in
the
stipulation
itself
to
show
especially
at
the
bottom
of
page
23
that
the
funds
deposited
in
these
accounts
are
the
property
of
the
owner
and
that
the
owner
himself
would
have
to
stand
all
those
--
well,
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact
and
actual
practice,
i
know
as
my
own
knowledge
that
each
account
is
kept
separate.
there
is
the
end
of
a
question
with
workmen’s
compensation
came
up,
it
would
be
paid
out
of
that
particular
account
and
no
other.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
it
paid
out
of
the
account,
that’s
right
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that
could
be
workmen’s
compensation,
any
type
of
insurance.
that’s
right.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
all
paid
by
the
owner.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
think
it’s
perfectly
clear,
your
honor.
quite
clear.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
they
sue
the
owner,
there
is
no
question.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
any
economic
law
suffered
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
buildings
is
suffered
by
the
owner
and
not
by
arnheim
and
neely.
arnheim
and
neely
is
compensated
through
its
commissions.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
no,
i
would
not.
and
that
brings
me
to
a
point
of
as
to
who
it
is
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
but
the
question
is,
they
don’t
do
anything
your
honor.
they
do
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
who
doesn’t
do
anything
--
they
don’t
do
--
arnheim
and
neely
doesn’t
do
anything?
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
oh!
no,
i
don’t.
if
i
said
that,
i
certainly
didn’t
mean
this
thing.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
owners
of
the
building
do
everything
with
the
respect
to
paying
the
freight,
let’s
put
it
that
way.
the
owners
of
the
building
pay
the
wages,
they
pay
the
salaries,
the
overtime,
everything
is
paid,
the
expenses.
the
real
estate
taxes,
everything
else.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
not
if
they
don’t
have
a
common
business
purpose
but
if
they
do,
it
could
be
an
enterprise
because
a
conglomerate
would
be
a
common
ownership
type
of
situation.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that’s
right.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
i
say
it
unless
there
is
a
common
business
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that
would
be
an
enterprise.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
if
it
has
a
common
business
purpose,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that
doesn’t
give
me
any
trouble
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
if
arnheim’s
commissions
exceeded
the
statutory
amount,
you
mean
for
coverage?
arnheim
and
neely’s
real
employees
might
be
covered.
arnheim
and
neely
has
no
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that’s
correct.
the
government
equates
who
is
an
employer
with
coverage
as
oppose
to
enforcement.
it’s
possible
that
arnheim
and
neely
as
an
employer
because
it
perhaps
have
right
to
hire
and
fire
is
responsible
for
the
enforcement
of
the
act.
the
same
as
it
would
be
possible
for
arnheim
and
neely
to
be
subject
to
the
zoning
laws,
governing
that
particular
building
and
also
the
safety
regulations
of
the
building.
but
to
say
that
arnheim
and
neely
is
subject
to
the
enforcement
provision
of
the
act
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
they
are
covered
under
the
act.
i
don’t
think
that
they
are
the
same
things.
and
that’s
what
the
third
circuit
was
saying
when
it
said
we
are
going
to
look
at
each
individual
building
and
that
the
vicarious
responsibility
as
cited
in
the
third
circuit
is
what
they
are
referring
to
there.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
--
you
mean
in
my
--
in
the
position
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
we’re
not
asking
the
court
to
expand
on
that
at
all.
therefore,
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
expand
on
the
order
of
third
circuit.
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
argue
anything
which
might
be
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
they
can
be
employees,
i
say
your
honor.
if
they
are
not
--
if
we
are
not
employer,
you
are
saying
that
there
is
no
sense
of
going
on
any
further
with
the
case?
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
we
are,
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
because
we
were
satisfied.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
since
we
were
satisfied
with
what
third
circuit
said,
we
didn’t
feel
it
was
incumbent
upon
us
to
file
a
cross-petition
in
order
to
protect
something
which
may
or
may
not
be
important
after
it
gets
back
to
the
local
court.
after
it
gets
back
to
the
local
court,
the
local
court
can
then
again
take
up
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
are
an
employer
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
the
third
circuit
really
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that’s
true
your
honor
but
the
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor
but
i
say
--
i
submit
that
it’s
possible
that
if
you
take
a
question
of
who
is
an
employer
with
respect
to
coverage
as
oppose
to
enforcement
that
there
might
be
a
difference
and
the
third
circuit
doesn’t
make
this
distinction,
they
just
said
it
was
the
employer.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
most
important
part
of
the
case
is
the
enterprise
doctrine
and
the
third
circuit
said,
it
can’t
be
an
enterprise,
it
have
to
look
to
each
individual
building
separately.
an
anomaly
would
be
created
if
arnheim
and
neely
were
to
be
considered
a
--
an
enterprise.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
that’s
essentially
correct,
that’s
i
didn’t
understand
the
chief
justice
remark
but
i
thought
he
wanted
me
to
give
other
reasons
for
sustaining
the
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
sustaining
the
judgment.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
understand
that
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
it
would
go
further
than
that,
that’s
right.
but
i
repeat
that
we
still
don’t
know
what
kind
--
whether
we
are
talking
about
employer
for
coverage
or
employer
for
purposes
of
enforcement.
the
third
circuit
has
pointed
out
the
anomaly
that
is
created
if
the
arnheim
and
neely
business
is
considered
an
enterprise.
it
would
be
anomalous
said
the
court
to
treat
the
owners
of
commercial
buildings
as
proprietors
of
individual
businesses
when
they
manage
the
buildings
themselves
and
as
participate
in
a
common
business
purpose
with
other
building
owners
merely
because
they
hire
a
rental
agent
who
manages
other
buildings.
now,
your
honor
i
can
point
this
up
with
an
illustration
from
arnheim
and
neely’s
own
situation.
at
the
time
this
suit
was
instituted,
arnheim
and
neely
manage
the
building
called
university
square
number
one,
a
ten-storey
apartment
building.
next
to
what
is
university
square
number
two
not
managed
by
arnheim
and
neely,
a
similar
ten-storey
building
separated
only
by
a
party
wall.
if
the
government’s
theory
is
correct,
the
janitor
in
university
square
number
one
is
covered
by
the
act
and
the
janitor
in
university
square
number
two
is
not
covered
by
the
act.
now
this
is
a
situation
where
the
government
is
creating
a
disparity
between
employees
coverage
whereas,
the
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
this
when
they
pressed
the
enterprise
doctrine
where
two
employees
side
by
side
where
not
covered
by
the
same
act.
now,
the
government
comes
in
and
says
we’re
going
to
cover
some
of
these
and
not
cover
others.
and
the
very
question
of
the
coverage
of
each
of
these
employees
depends
on
who
the
management
agent
might
be.
so,
i
say
your
honors
that
if
arnheim
and
neely
is
an
agent
which
it
is
and
if
arnheim
and
neely
manages
buildings
which
it
does,
and
if
arnheim
and
neely
manages
buildings
which
are
all
local
in
character
which
they
are,
how
can
the
agent
rise
higher
than
his
principle?
how
can
the
government
do
indirectly
what
it
can’t
do
directly
because
of
the
callus
case?
congress
never
intended
such
a
result,
your
honors.
the
law
doesn’t
provide
for
it
and
the
logic
and
reasoning
had
shown
in
the
third
circuit
opinion
should
be
sustained.
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
first
would
like
to
answer
the
court’s
question
respect
to
who
owns
the
bank
accounts
involved
in
this
case.
on
the
bottom
of
page
23
of
the
stipulation,
it
says
specifically
the
funds
deposited
in
these
accounts
for
the
property
of
the
owner
and
not
of
arnheim
and
neely.
and
arnheim
and
neely
is
not
liable
in
the
event
of
bankruptcy
or
failure
of
the
depositor.
there’s
no
question,
your
honors,
that
these
are
agency
accounts
and
that
arnheim
and
neely
would
not
be
liable
for
any
of
the
wages
personally
if
these
buildings
could
not
meet
the
payroll
itself.
now,
this
history
of
this
case
started
in
1965.
at
which
time,
one
of
the
labor
department
representatives
came
in
to
arnheim
and
neely’s
quarters
to
examine
the
operation,
decided
that
arnheim
and
neely
was
an
enterprise
and
we
have
been
on
the
road
ever
since.
when
we
reach
the
litigation
stage
in
1967,
we
knew
that
we
were
guinea
pig
and
that
we
were
the
first
to
be
hit
with
the
suit
by
an
agent
who
had
no
ownership
in
any
of
the
buildings
which
it
managed.
because
of
the
importance
to
the
industry,
the
instituted
real
estate
management
asked
to
leave
to
intervene
as
a
party
defendant
and
was
given
that
permission.
we
lost
the
first
trial
in
the
federal
court
in
pennsylvania.
shortly
after
our
case
came
down,
a
similar
case
was
started
by
the
federal
government
in
the
district
court
of
virginia.
and
despite
the
holding
against
us,
the
district
court
of
virginia
decided
in
favor
of
the
real
estate
managing.
in
that
case,
they
made
a
threshold
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
measure
should
be
gross
receipts
or
gross
commissions
and
they
held
it
should
be
gross
commissions
because
the
real
estate
manager
didn’t
own
any
of
the
gross
receipts
themselves.
so
we
went
into
the
circuit
court
in
the
third
circuit
feeling
pretty
good
that
the
--
at
least
we
had
one
case
in
our
favor
namely
the
virginia
case.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that
was
the
district
court.
right.
prior
to
the
argument
in
the
third
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
got
ahead
of
use
and
decided
and
reversed
the
lower
court
in
virginia.
so
then
the
government
came
in
to
the
argument
and
said
we
got
a
pretty
good
case
also.
despite
the
fourth
circuit
case
and
the
lower
court
case
in
its
own
district,
the
third
circuit
decided
that
arnheim
and
neely
was
not
an
enterprise.
in
a
very
well-reasoned
opinion,
concise,
logical
and
i
may
be
a
little
prejudice
but
i
still
say
it’s
that.
i
don’t
have
to
go
in
to
detail
as
to
the
nature
of
arnheim
and
neely’s
activities,
it’s
already
been
discussed.
there
are
many
unusual
type
of
activities
than
usual
type
of
management
activities.
but
there
is
one
point,
your
honors
that
i
have
to
make
clear
and
emphasize.
arnheim
and
neely
does
not
own
any
of
the
buildings
in
which
it
manages.
they
are
just
no
ownership
present,
that’s
all.
every
case
of
enterprise
must
have
some
type
of
ownership
going
with
it.
and
they
don’t
have
any
ownership
here.
also
in
discussing
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well
i’m
coming
to
that
your
honor,
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
think
almost
it
is
your
honor.
i
really
think
that
in
order
to
show
an
enterprise
that
you
have
to
show
some
ownership.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
sir?
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
security
guards
may
or
may
not
be
an
enterprise
depending
on
whom
they
work
for.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
not
the
security
guards
your
honor.
of
course
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
i
may
have
been
misunderstood
but
i
say
that
the
enterprise
doctrine
itself
must
show
some
and
i
think
i
will
be
able
to
point
to
that
your
honors
little
more
clearly
that
the
enterprise
doctrine
must
contain
some
type
of
ownership
in
order
to
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
am
talking
about
title
to
the
receipts
which
they
receive
for
example,
the
gross
rentals
that
they
receive.
well,
let
me
continue
and
i
think
i
will
be
able
to
explain
it.
this
court
decided
back
in
1945,
the
case
of
10
east
40th
street
building
versus
callus.
that
case
involved
a
local
building
operation
and
because
of
that
decision,
the
court
held
that
the
employees
were
not
within
the
interstate
commerce
rule
and
it
was
a
part
--
simply
a
local
operation.
now,
we
have
here
nine
separate
buildings,
all
of
which
can
be
considered
to
be
callus
cases.
the
government
says,
well
since
that
case,
we
have
gone
into
the
enterprise
doctrine
and
therefore
that
case
doesn’t
hold
right.
of
course
the
case
is
still
being
cited
everyday
for
the
proposition
for
which
it
stands
and
the
crux
of
the
real
issue
here
is,
does
the
enterprise
doctrine
nullified
the
holding
of
the
callus
case.
so
we
are
back
again
to
the
definition
situation
as
to
what
is
an
enterprise.
and
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
stewart
deplored
the
exercise
in
semantics
in
the
maryland
versus
wirtz
case.
we
are
going
to
have
to
do
a
little
exercise
in
semantics,
nevertheless.
the
definition
states
related
activities
performed
either
through
unified
operation
or
common
control
by
any
person
or
persons
for
a
common
business
purpose.
the
word
“common”
appears
in
this
definition
twice
in
three
lines.
so,
i
must
assume
that
the
word
is
rather
important.
but
let’s
take
each
of
the
definition
words
as
it
goes
down.
first,
it
says
related.
what
are
related
activities?
well,
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
they
are
the
internal
activities
of
arnheim
and
neely
which
are
related.
well,
of
course
any
building
has
internal
activities
which
are
related
to
each
other.
this
is
not
what
the
congress
meant
your
honors.
the
related
activities
are
those
which
concern
more
than
one
business.
not
just
arnheim
and
neely
business
but
more
than
one
business
with
common
ownership.
lacking
the
common
ownership,
there
can
be
no
related
activity,
unified
operation
or
common
control.
well,
i
could
only
refer
to
those
activities
where
there
is
more
than
one
business.
naturally,
a
single
business
has
unified
operation
in
common
control
and
not
as
the
government
contends
to
a
single
operation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
common
control
may
not
even
be
enough.
a
recent
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
decided
since
out
case
called
university
club
tower
case
involved
a
situation
where
one
corporation
controlled
both
an
apartment
building
and
a
hotel.
and
the
court
said,
well
the
business
purpose
of
a
hotel
is
not
the
same
as
the
business
purpose
of
a
apartment
building,
therefore,
no
enterprise.
so,
i
submit
to
you
honors,
if
a
hotel
and
an
apartment
building
which
are
commonly
owned
and
controlled
are
not
an
enterprise,
how
can
there
be
an
enterprise
where
you
have
a
number
of
unrelated
buildings
merely
because
they
have
a
common
agent.
the
use
of
the
work
“common”
as
i
said
before
is
a
very
important
phrase
--
word.
when
you
talk
about
“common,”
you
talk
about
more
than
one.
even
the
definition
of
common
in
the
dictionary
says,
belonging
to,
or
equally
shared
by
two
or
more
individuals.
well
now,
i
know
that
learned
hand
once
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
make
forth
recite
a
dictionary
and
i’m
not
saying
that
we
should
in
this
case.”
but
nevertheless,
this
court
had
talking
to
mr.
justice
vinson
once
said,
“we
have
consistently
refused
to
pervert
the
process
of
interpretation
by
mechanically
applying
definitions
in
unattended
context
refused
to
pervert.”
those
are
strong
words
in
those
days
but
they
have
a
different
connotations
today
and
i
am
not
going
to
accuse
the
government
of
any
type
of
perversion
but
they
are
certainly
are
distorting
the
words
of
this
definition
of
enterprise.
“common,”
if
i
use
my
driveway
with
my
wife
and
family,
if
i
created
a
common
driveway?
of
course
not.
but
if
i
use
my
driveway
with
somebody
on
the
other
side
who
has
got
a
property
on
the
other
side,
then
i
have
created
something
in
common.
the
government,
however
says
because
arnheim
and
neely
is
operating
more
than
one
building,
it
is
in
common.
it’s
operating
with
itself
and
i
say
that
this
thus
doesn’t
mean
anything
as
far
as
definition
at
large
is
concern.
now,
i’ve
taken
the
definition
apart.
let’s
put
it
back
together
again.
what
is
an
enterprise?
well,
i
think
an
enterprise
is
demonstrated
mainly
by
the
so-called
bank
and
insurance
cases.
the
bank
owns
an
office
building.
it
uses
part
of
the
office
building
itself
and
it
rents
out
to
the
general
public
the
balance
of
the
building.
prior
to
the
institution
of
the
enterprise
doctrine,
the
bank
guard
was
subject
to
the
act
and
the
office
building
guard,
he
worked
along
side
with
him
was
not
subject
to
the
act.
and
to
correct
that,
congress
said,
if
you
are
in
an
enterprise
then
this
is
where
both
people
should
be
under
the
same
act
and
i
quite
agree.
but
that’s
not
the
situation
with
we
have.
in
that
case
again,
the
ownership
was
the
bank
who
own
the
office
building
and
that
i
said
your
honors
is
what
a
true
enterprise
really
is.
now,
there
was
some
discussion
when
the
honorable
solicitor
was
talking
about
some
of
the
economic
reality
and
situation
and
this
court
has
said
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
social
legislation
such
as
this,
we
must
look
at
the
economic
realities.
now,
what
are
the
economic
realities
with
respect
to
the
employees
of
these
separate
buildings?
first
place,
the
employees
go
with
the
building.
they
don’t
go
with
arnheim
and
neely.
since
the
case
has
been
instituted,
arnheim
and
neely
has
lost
the
management
of
some
of
these
buildings
that
are
mentioned
here.
they
gained
other
ones
and
there
is
a
continual
shifting
over
because
some
buildings
are
sold,
some
buildings
are
tired
of
the
manager,
they
want
a
new
manager
for
one
reason
or
another
that
buildings
are
no
longer
managed
by
arnheim
and
neely.
the
employees
stay
with
the
building,
they
don’t
go
with
arnheim
and
neely.
the
rates
are
paid,
the
fringe
benefits,
other
wage
and
salary
matters
all
are
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
owner
without
exception.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
don’t
think
it’s
in
the
stipulation
your
honor,
probably
this
wasn’t
thought
about
with
respect
to
talking
about
the
minimum
wage,
we
are
talking
about
workmen’s
compensation
but
i
think
there
is
enough
in
the
stipulation
itself
to
show
especially
at
the
bottom
of
page
23
that
the
funds
deposited
in
these
accounts
are
the
property
of
the
owner
and
that
the
owner
himself
would
have
to
stand
all
those
--
well,
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact
and
actual
practice,
i
know
as
my
own
knowledge
that
each
account
is
kept
separate.
there
is
the
end
of
a
question
with
workmen’s
compensation
came
up,
it
would
be
paid
out
of
that
particular
account
and
no
other.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
it
paid
out
of
the
account,
that’s
right
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that
could
be
workmen’s
compensation,
any
type
of
insurance.
that’s
right.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
all
paid
by
the
owner.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
think
it’s
perfectly
clear,
your
honor.
quite
clear.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
they
sue
the
owner,
there
is
no
question.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
any
economic
law
suffered
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
buildings
is
suffered
by
the
owner
and
not
by
arnheim
and
neely.
arnheim
and
neely
is
compensated
through
its
commissions.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
no,
i
would
not.
and
that
brings
me
to
a
point
of
as
to
who
it
is
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
but
the
question
is,
they
don’t
do
anything
your
honor.
they
do
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
who
doesn’t
do
anything
--
they
don’t
do
--
arnheim
and
neely
doesn’t
do
anything?
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
oh!
no,
i
don’t.
if
i
said
that,
i
certainly
didn’t
mean
this
thing.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
owners
of
the
building
do
everything
with
the
respect
to
paying
the
freight,
let’s
put
it
that
way.
the
owners
of
the
building
pay
the
wages,
they
pay
the
salaries,
the
overtime,
everything
is
paid,
the
expenses.
the
real
estate
taxes,
everything
else.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
not
if
they
don’t
have
a
common
business
purpose
but
if
they
do,
it
could
be
an
enterprise
because
a
conglomerate
would
be
a
common
ownership
type
of
situation.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that’s
right.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
i
say
it
unless
there
is
a
common
business
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that
would
be
an
enterprise.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
if
it
has
a
common
business
purpose,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that
doesn’t
give
me
any
trouble
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
if
arnheim’s
commissions
exceeded
the
statutory
amount,
you
mean
for
coverage?
arnheim
and
neely’s
real
employees
might
be
covered.
arnheim
and
neely
has
no
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that’s
correct.
the
government
equates
who
is
an
employer
with
coverage
as
oppose
to
enforcement.
it’s
possible
that
arnheim
and
neely
as
an
employer
because
it
perhaps
have
right
to
hire
and
fire
is
responsible
for
the
enforcement
of
the
act.
the
same
as
it
would
be
possible
for
arnheim
and
neely
to
be
subject
to
the
zoning
laws,
governing
that
particular
building
and
also
the
safety
regulations
of
the
building.
but
to
say
that
arnheim
and
neely
is
subject
to
the
enforcement
provision
of
the
act
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
they
are
covered
under
the
act.
i
don’t
think
that
they
are
the
same
things.
and
that’s
what
the
third
circuit
was
saying
when
it
said
we
are
going
to
look
at
each
individual
building
and
that
the
vicarious
responsibility
as
cited
in
the
third
circuit
is
what
they
are
referring
to
there.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
--
you
mean
in
my
--
in
the
position
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
we’re
not
asking
the
court
to
expand
on
that
at
all.
therefore,
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
expand
on
the
order
of
third
circuit.
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
argue
anything
which
might
be
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
they
can
be
employees,
i
say
your
honor.
if
they
are
not
--
if
we
are
not
employer,
you
are
saying
that
there
is
no
sense
of
going
on
any
further
with
the
case?
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
we
are,
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
because
we
were
satisfied.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
since
we
were
satisfied
with
what
third
circuit
said,
we
didn’t
feel
it
was
incumbent
upon
us
to
file
a
cross-petition
in
order
to
protect
something
which
may
or
may
not
be
important
after
it
gets
back
to
the
local
court.
after
it
gets
back
to
the
local
court,
the
local
court
can
then
again
take
up
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
are
an
employer
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
the
third
circuit
really
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that’s
true
your
honor
but
the
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor
but
i
say
--
i
submit
that
it’s
possible
that
if
you
take
a
question
of
who
is
an
employer
with
respect
to
coverage
as
oppose
to
enforcement
that
there
might
be
a
difference
and
the
third
circuit
doesn’t
make
this
distinction,
they
just
said
it
was
the
employer.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
most
important
part
of
the
case
is
the
enterprise
doctrine
and
the
third
circuit
said,
it
can’t
be
an
enterprise,
it
have
to
look
to
each
individual
building
separately.
an
anomaly
would
be
created
if
arnheim
and
neely
were
to
be
considered
a
--
an
enterprise.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
well,
that’s
essentially
correct,
that’s
i
didn’t
understand
the
chief
justice
remark
but
i
thought
he
wanted
me
to
give
other
reasons
for
sustaining
the
--
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
sustaining
the
judgment.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
i
understand
that
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
eugene
b.
strassburger,
jr.
it
would
go
further
than
that,
that’s
right.
but
i
repeat
that
we
still
don’t
know
what
kind
--
whether
we
are
talking
about
employer
for
coverage
or
employer
for
purposes
of
enforcement.
the
third
circuit
has
pointed
out
the
anomaly
that
is
created
if
the
arnheim
and
neely
business
is
considered
an
enterprise.
it
would
be
anomalous
said
the
court
to
treat
the
owners
of
commercial
buildings
as
proprietors
of
individual
businesses
when
they
manage
the
buildings
themselves
and
as
participate
in
a
common
business
purpose
with
other
building
owners
merely
because
they
hire
a
rental
agent
who
manages
other
buildings.
now,
your
honor
i
can
point
this
up
with
an
illustration
from
arnheim
and
neely’s
own
situation.
at
the
time
this
suit
was
instituted,
arnheim
and
neely
manage
the
building
called
university
square
number
one,
a
ten-storey
apartment
building.
next
to
what
is
university
square
number
two
not
managed
by
arnheim
and
neely,
a
similar
ten-storey
building
separated
only
by
a
party
wall.
if
the
government’s
theory
is
correct,
the
janitor
in
university
square
number
one
is
covered
by
the
act
and
the
janitor
in
university
square
number
two
is
not
covered
by
the
act.
now
this
is
a
situation
where
the
government
is
creating
a
disparity
between
employees
coverage
whereas,
the
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
this
when
they
pressed
the
enterprise
doctrine
where
two
employees
side
by
side
where
not
covered
by
the
same
act.
now,
the
government
comes
in
and
says
we’re
going
to
cover
some
of
these
and
not
cover
others.
and
the
very
question
of
the
coverage
of
each
of
these
employees
depends
on
who
the
management
agent
might
be.
so,
i
say
your
honors
that
if
arnheim
and
neely
is
an
agent
which
it
is
and
if
arnheim
and
neely
manages
buildings
which
it
does,
and
if
arnheim
and
neely
manages
buildings
which
are
all
local
in
character
which
they
are,
how
can
the
agent
rise
higher
than
his
principle?
how
can
the
government
do
indirectly
what
it
can’t
do
directly
because
of
the
callus
case?
congress
never
intended
such
a
result,
your
honors.
the
law
doesn’t
provide
for
it
and
the
logic
and
reasoning
had
shown
in
the
third
circuit
opinion
should
be
sustained.
thank
you.
