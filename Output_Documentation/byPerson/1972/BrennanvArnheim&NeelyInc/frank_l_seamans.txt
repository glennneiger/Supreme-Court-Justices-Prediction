mr.
frank
l.
seamans
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
i
think
it’s
apparent
why
the
institute
of
real
estate
management
is
concerned
about
this
case,
your
permission
now.
i
just
make
one
brief
argument
concerning
the
construction
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
that
we
don’t
believe
the
congress
intended
the
result
that
the
government
position
would
achieve
in
this
case.
we’ve
been
arguing
about
what
is
an
enterprise
and
what
is
an
employer
and
what
is
an
employee.
but
we
believe
when
the
statute
doesn’t
define
itself
and
you
apply
it
to
a
set
of
facts.
if
you
are
convinced
that
congress
didn’t
intend
to
that
result
that
that
should
bear
on
your
interpretation.
now,
i
based
that
on
two
premises.
it’s
my
understanding
that
it
is
acknowledged
that
congress
didn’t
go
as
far
as
they
might
go
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
something
has
held
back
and
congress
itself
adopted
the
monetary
limit,
a
financial
limit
in
its
application
so
i
argue
that
there
is
a
congressional
intent
that
there
are
still
to
be
some
local
buildings
that
do
not
have
to
meet
the
minimum
wage,
the
overtime
requirements.
it’s
purely
economic.
i
argue
that
congress
intended
that
somebody
is
still
left
up
whether
they
should
be
or
not,
i
suggest
that
that’s
what
congress
intended.
the
consequence
here
is,
in
the
opinion
of
the
clients
that
i
represent
and
there
are
some
2,500,
pardon
me,
these
realtors
in
the
institute
represent
some
2,500
small
office
buildings
and
some
5,000
small
apartment
buildings
across
the
country
and
that’s
why
the
district
court
permitted
the
intervention.
it
is
our
concern
that
if
this
rule
applies
and
the
building
owner
considers
the
employment
of
a
rental
agent,
he
would
be
well
advised
to
ask
that
rental
agent
two
questions.
first,
are
you
mr.
rental
agent
in
interstate
commerce?
secondly,
do
you
have
any
other
client
who
is?
because
if
the
answer
is
yes
to
either
of
those
questions
and
automatically
i
go
in
and
automatically
my
elevator
operator,
my
maintenance
people
are
paid
time
and
a
half.
i
can’t
afford
it
will
effect
my
maintenance.
pardon
me,
my
financial
operation.
this
as
we
see
it
is
coverage
by
association
with
whom
do
you
associate
yourself
and
not
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
do.
so
that
is
the
position
if
your
honors
please
of
the
institute
that
we
can
get
lost
in
a
morass
of
semantics
in
using
manufactured
words
and
statutory
words
like
enterprise
and
employer
and
employee
and
we
find
our
selves
chasing
our
tail.
but
if
we
are
convinced
that
congress
never
intended
the
result
that
this
would
achieve,
we
submit
that
that
is
the
place
to
fire
and
the
answer
for
the
pure
construction
of
this
statute.
and
we’re
quite
convinced
and
i
think
if
your
honor
will
reflect
on
it,
the
idea
that
you
get
coverage
by
association
and
not
by
your
own
status
or
activity
would
lead
to
conclusion
that
however
you
do
it,
whether
why
an
interpretation
of
enterprise
whether
by
an
interpretation
of
the
employer.
the
achievement
here
of
a
result
not
intended
by
congress
should
not
be
sustained.
thank
you,
your
honors.
