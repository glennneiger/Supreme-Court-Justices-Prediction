states.
mr.
homans
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
homans,
i
think
you
can
help
a
little
bit.
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
affirmatively
indicates
that
the
district
judge
did
not
consider
probation?
can
you
help
me
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there’s
nothing
at
judge
rozanski’s
order
that
would
indicate
the
judgment
and
commitment
doesn’t
indicate
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
ordinarily,
a
district
judge
would
not
give
any
indication
one
way
or
the
other,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
we
said
that
counsel,
where
we
saying
any
more
than
day
--
night
follows
day
that
was
merely
an
observation
about
the
chronological
events?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
each
case,
are
probation
and
parole
a
sentence
as
pronounced,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
each
under
a
sentence
and
the
--
perhaps
physically
a
difference
is
that
the
release
begins
immediately
on
probation
and
it’s
deferred
in
the
parole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
rather
than
being
an
act
of
grace,
wouldn’t
it
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
it’s
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
changing
probation
now
--
probation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
this
record
showed
that
at
the
time
of
sentencing
there
have
been
arguments
urging
probation
with
all
the
usual
reasons
that
puts
you
advanced
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
the
judge
said,
i
have
and
this
is
all
on
the
record
and
in
the
record
when
the
case
comes
on
review,
i
have
considered
the
arguments
and
the
reasons
advanced
for
a
probation
and
i
conclude
that
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
granting
probation
because
of
the
past
history
of
this
defendant,
where
would
you
be
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that
all
of
those
events
have
preceded
the
sentence,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
enlighten
me
on
how
that
then
is
not
part
of
the
sentencing
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
my
hypothesis,
the
events
had
taken
place
before
the
sentence
and
the
judgment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lacovara.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
this
case
involve
parole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
have
any
way
of
knowing
that
the
district
judge
did
not
consider
and
reject
probation?
do
we
know
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
mr.
lacovara.
thank
you
mr.

the
case
