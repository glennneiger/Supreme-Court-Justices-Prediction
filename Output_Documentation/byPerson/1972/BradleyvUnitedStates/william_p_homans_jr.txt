from

that
is
the
only
indication,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
such
a
motion
was
filed
in
the
district
court
prior
to
what
being
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
any
event,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
this
was
a
prosecution
under
the
prior
drug
law
which
was
repealed
by
public
law
in
91-513
effective
may
1,
1971.
the
indictment,
which
appears
on
pages
2
through
5
inclusive
of
the
appendix,
charged
a
conspiracy
in
several
of
the
counts
between
four
--
between
march
4,
1971
and
march
12,
1971
as
well
as
charging
under
4705
of
former
title
26,
several
--
all
of
the
defendants
the
substantive
offense
of
giving
away
selling
or
the
distribution
of
cocaine.
the
indictment
may
it
please
the
court,
also
charge
in
counts,
which
are
not
material
here,
three
of
the
four
petitioners
was
carrying
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
felony.
the
important
aspect
to
this
case
so
far
as
the
indictment
is
concern
is
that
the
indictment
alleged
that
the
offense
took
place
between
march
4
and
march
10,
1971,
which
was
before
may
1,
1971
the
effective
date
of
repeal
as
a
result
of
91-513
public
law.
91-513
of
the
prior
drug
law,
which
contain
among
other
statutes
26
u.s.
code
section
7237
(d),
which
appears
again
on
pages
three
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
provides
as
your
honors
are
aware
that
upon
conviction
of
offenses
the
penalty
and
i
emphasize
penalty
for
which
is
provided
in
sub-section
(b)
of
this
section
that
the
imposition
or
execution
of
sentence
shall
not
be
suspended,
probation
shall
not
be
granted
and
in
the
case
of
a
violation
of
a
law
relating
to
narcotic
drugs,
section
4202
of
title
18.
the
statutes
otherwise
providing
for
parole
shall
not
apply.
i
would
emphasize
in
connection
of
later
portions
of
the
argument
the
language
in
(d)
of
7237,
which
says,
upon
conviction
of
any
offense,
the
penalty
for
which
is
provided
in
sub-section
(b)
referring
that
in
sub-section
(b)
of
7237,
that
provides,
whoever
conspires
to
commit
an
offense
described
in
4705
(a)
shall
be
imprisoned
not
less
than
five
or
more
than
20
years.
and
in
addition,
may
be
fined
not
more
than
$20,000.
thus,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
accordance
at
least
for
the
language
of
7237
(d),
the
penalty
appears
in
section
(b).
again
and
i'm
hesitant
to
read
statutes
except
that
the
wording
of
the
very
statutes
involved
in
it
here
is
important
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
there
were
two
saving
statutes
involved,
may
it
please
the
court
in
this
case.
the
first
statute
is
the
general
saving
statute,
1
united
states
code
section
109,
which
i
will
read
again
with
some
--
which
i’ll
read
with
some
emphasis.
the
repeal
of
any
statute
shall
not
have
the
effect
to
release
or
extinguish
any
penalty,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“penalty”,
forfeiture,
or
liability
incurred
under
such
statute,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“incurred”
under
such
statute,
unless,
the
repealing
act
shall
so
expressly
provide
and
such
statute
shall
be
treated
as
still
remaining
in
force
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
any
proper
action
or
prosecution
which
i
emphasize,
for
the
enforcement
of
such
penalty,
forfeiture
or
liability.
that
is
the
general
saving
statute,
which
has
been
in
the
statute
book
since
late
in
the
19th
century
unchanged.
the
specific
statute,
which
appeared
in
public
law
91-513
provides
and
again,
i
use
some
emphasis
prosecutions.
i
emphasized
the
word
prosecutions
for
any
of
violation
of
law
and
i'm
reading
from
page
4
of
our
brief
occurring
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
section
1101
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
repeals
or
amendment
made
by
such
section
or
abated
by
reason
thereof.
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice?
we
suggest
here
that
section
1103
(a),
the
specific
saving
statute
which
i
have
just
concluded
reading
controls
this
case
and
under
the
doctrines
of
conflicts
set
forth
in
hertz
against
woodman
and
in
great
northern
railway
against
united
states,
both
of
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
and
in
our
brief
on
pages
9
through
13
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
we
suggest
that
the
conflict
in
wording
between
section
1103
(a),
the
specific
statute
and
section
109,
the
general
statute.
it
is
sufficient
so
that
1103
(a)
is
the
only
saving
statute
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
later
on,
if
time
permits
we
shall
argue
that
even
if
the
court
disagrees
and
109
applies
that
the
same
results
should
still
follow,
but
for
the
moment,
i
address
myself
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
to
the
effect
of
the
specific
saving
statute.
your
honor
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court
will
note
that
1103
(a),
the
specific
statute
refers
only
to
the
word
“prosecutions.”
it
does
not
use
the
word
--
words
penalty,
forfeiture,
or
liability,
and
the
contention
of
the
petitioners
resolves
itself,
we
suggest
based
upon
the
meaning
of
the
word
prosecution.
the
government
urges
that
not
withstanding
the
wording
of
the
7237
(d)
that
both
probation,
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
order
a
suspension
of
sentence
and
finally
a
parole
under
18
u.s.
code
4202
is
part
of
the
prosecution
as
the
word
is
used
in
section
1103
(a).
we
disagree
and
there
are
reasons
both
from
a
policy
point
of
view,
as
well
as
from
a
conceptual
point
of
view,
which
we
submit
in
support
of
our
argument.
the
cases
of
affronti
and
murray
and
finally
ellen
vogan
appearing
on
pages
--
which
was
cited
on
pages
14
of
our
brief
and
as
cited
as
well
in
the
united
states’
brief.
all
show
that
the
--
a
court
does
have
authority
following
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
prior
to
the
execution
of
the
sentence
to
grant
probation
and
to
suspend
sentence.
thus,
although
it
did
not
take
place
in
this
case
and
it
does
not
take
place
in
most
cases
as
the
solicitor
general
correctly
points
out.
in
some
case
--
have
the
district
court
here
for
example,
sentenced
these
defendants
to
five
years
not
suspended
sentence
assuming
that
he
had
the
power
to
do
so
and
there
after
before
incarceration
and
while
the
case
was
not
on
appeal
for
example
of
the
court
of
appeals.
if
there
have
been
some
reasons
for
delay
in
execution
of
the
sentence
before
execution
of
the
sentence,
he
had
then
suspended
sentence
and
granted
probation.
he
would
have
been
within
the
authority
which
appears
very
plainly
and
affronti
and
murray
and
in
a
second
circuit
case
ellen
vogan
where
that
actually
took
place.
the
government’s
brief
correctly
points
out
that
as
ellen
vogan
says,
normally,
the
imposition
of
probation
and
the
suspension
of
sentence
should
normally
take
place
at
the
time
of
sentence,
but
the
court
has
authority,
nevertheless
to
suspend
and
to
grant
probation
during
that
interval,
if
there
is
interval
between
imposition
of
sentence
and
suspend
--
and
excuse
me
execution.
thus,
a
sentence
being
in
99%
of
the
cases
is
permanent
indicates
which
is
also
cited
on
page
14
of
our
case.
the
judgment
sentence
has
concluded,
we
suggest
the
prosecution
as
of
the
date,
as
of
the
time
that
it’s
imposed.
sentence,
of
course,
as
we
suggest
looks
to
the
past
or
and
the
judgment
looks
to
the
past.
it
looks
to
the
determination
of
guilt.
it
looks
to
the
considerations,
which
the
trial
judge
takes
into
account
in
determining
the
term
of
imprisonment
or
the
amount
of
the
fine.
it
looks
to
the
prior
criminal
record
if
any
of
the
defendant
or
for
that
matter
to
whatever
good
works
he
has
done
in
his
life.
whereas
probation
looks
to
the
future
--
probation
as
an
act
of
grace
looks
to
the
opportunity
which
the
defendant
may
have
to
rehabilitate
himself
while
instead
of
being
incarcerated
through
the
grace
of
the
court
and
through
the
act
of
grace
which
is
the
suspension
of
sentence
and
probation.
he
finds
himself
to
use
the
colloquial
phrase
on
the
street
rather
than
incarcerated.
so
that
these
are
two
separate
concepts
and
the
difference,
may
it
please
the
court,
between
probation
and
suspended
sentences
and
act
of
grace
on
the
one
hand
and
the
imposition
of
a
term
of
years
on
the
other
hand
as
policy
matters
is
consistent
with
what
we’ve
urged
and
that
the
affronti
and
murray
and
ellen
vogan
cases
shall
namely
that
there
is
a
difference
conceptually
between
the
sentence
and
the
discretion
of
the
court
or
its
exercise
in
impose
in
granting
probations
and
in
suspending
sentence.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
with
respect
to
parole
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
not
trying
to
hedge,
it
does
not
reach
that
because
of
course
we
resentence
after
the
repeal
of
the
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
to
parole,
we
suggest
the
question
is
even
clearer
under
the
language
of
this
court
in
morrissey
against
brewer
which
appears
--
is
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief
408
u.s.
471
at
page
480.
the
court
said,
parole
arises
after
the
end
of
the
criminal
prosecution
including
imposition
of
sentence.
therefore,
even
more
clearly
than
is
the
case
in
probation
in
the
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
the
sentence
has
been
pronounced.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
are
those
similarities
and
of
course
by
saying
that
the
parole
is
--
the
parole
issue
was
strong
here
and
the
probation
issue,
we
certainly
don’t
concede
the
probation
issue.
but
i
would
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
with
respect
to
parole
--
the
determination
for
example
of
when
parole
shall
be
granted
except
in
the
exception
provided
by
4208
(a)
is
an
executive
order
at
least
for
federal
purposes
and
an
executive
rather
than
a
judicial
party.
the
board
of
parole
that
the
matter
except
again
in
the
case
of
the
exception
4208
(a),
the
matter
is
not
a
judicial
matter,
it’s
not
in
the
control
of
the
court,
but
it’s
in
control
of
the
executive
body
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
parole
to
see
how
the
man
does
during
the
time
he’s
been
incarcerated
and
taken
into
consideration
his
background.
and
thereafter,
give
him
the
opportunity
to
remain
in
a
form
of
custody
and
what
the
court
called
a
variation
in
morrissey
against
brewer
upon
imprisonment.
but
again,
on
the
street
under
supervision
of
his
parole
officer
until
the
time
of
his
original
term
has
finished.
so
that
in
that
sense,
may
it
please
the
court,
it’s
like
probation
and
that
he
has
a
form
of
supervision
by
an
executive
–
by
an
employee
of
the
executive,
the
parole
officer.
but
that
the
determination
is
made
completely
separately
from
the
original
determination
made
by
the
court
as
to
the
term
of
years
or
the
fine
in
a
few
cases
where
they
all
find
the
term
of
years
which
the
prisoner,
which
the
defendant
will
serve.
so
that
again,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
suggest
that
the
concepts
are
entirely
different
whether
you
call
parole
of
form
of
an
act
of
grace
or
whatever
terminology
when
puts
on
it.
nevertheless,
there
are
completely
different
considerations
going
into
whether
a
man
is
paroled.
then
the
sentence
imposed
upon
him
whether
that
sentence
is
to
be
suspended
or
served.
now,
coming
back
to
that
for
the
moment
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
with
all
respect
may
it
please
the
court,
parole
except
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
probation?
oh!
yes
--
yes
sir,
there’s
no
question.
but
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
to
grant
probation
and
to
suspend
sentence
certainly
it
is
in
the
exercise
of
some
judicial
discretion,
but
it
comes,
may
it
please
the
court,
after
the
court
has
already
determined
this
man
shall
serve
so
many
years
if
--
that
this
man
shall
serve
so
many
years
that
the
court
then
comes
to
the
question
of
whether
it
shall
exercise
its
discretion
to
grant
probation
coupled
with
a
suspended
sentence,
or
suspended
suspension
of
a
sentence
which
is
already
been
ordered.
and
as
the
nagelburg
indicates
–
case
indicates
on
page
which
we
cited
on
page
16.
if
the
unhappy
in
the
other
happy
event
the
probation
is
eventually
revoke
and
the
sentence
is
ordered
to
be
served
at
some
future
time
during
the
period
of
the
service
of
the
probation
term,
then
to
quote
the
court,
the
original
term
although
suspended
“informs
the
judge
who
revokes
probation
of
what
the
trial
judge
thought
in
appropriate
prison
term
would
be.”
in
that
case,
which
is
helpful
for
our
purposes
in
that
case
one
judge
had
imposed
the
original
sentence
and
suspended
it.
a
second
judge
revoked
the
probation
and
ordered
service
of
the
sentence
and
the
concept
by
the
--
that
the
court
of
appeal’s
voice
in
that
case
was
that
that
what
was
to
be
done
by
the
second
judge
so
far
as
imprisonment
was
concerned
was
already
decided
by
the
first
judge
indicating
again
the
separation
between
the
two
concepts.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
may
it
please.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
perhaps,
to
a
lay
person
not
understanding
the
difference
in
concepts
without
possibility
of
parole,
your
honor
would
normally
as
i
understand
have
resulted
from
authority
of
a
statute
such
as
in
this
case
7237
(d)
for
the
court
to
make
that
order.
and
again,
may
it
please
the
court?
similarly
to
the
power
of
the
federal
court
and
given
by
4208
(a)
to
use
statutory
authority
either
to
order
that
parole
to
be
granted
as
the
case
in
4208
(a)
at
an
earlier
time,
whereas
in
the
case,
your
honor
poses
to
say
that
under
again
under
statutory
authority
that
no
parole
shall
ever
be
given.
again,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
judiciary
or
the
particular
judges
involved
in
that
decision,
but
the
decision
now,
i
would
suggest
is
not
part
of
the
--
is
not
part
of
the
sentence
for
the
purposes
we’re
dealing
with
sentence
here,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
agree
your
honor,
and
there
is
perhaps
a
logical
inconsistency
between
the
case
your
honor
poses
and
the
position
we
take
here
which
is
also
present
as
i
say
in
the
case
of
4208
(a).
but
we
would
suggest
that
in
the
bases
of
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
berman
case,
in
the
roberts
case,
and
the
many
other
cases,
which
have
dealt
with
the
differences
between
either
probation
or
parole
on
the
one
hand
and
the
power
of
the
court
to
sentence
to
a
term
of
years
and
the
fine
or
a
fine
on
the
other
that
so
far
as
the
word
“prosecution”
is
concerned
in
section
1103
(a).
the
specific
saving
statute
that
the
prosecution
has
ended
--
the
prosecution
has
ended,
may
it
please
the
court
with
the
imposition
of
sentence
regardless
of
what
takes
place
afterwards
in
terms
either
of
the
exercise
of
probation
or
suspension
of
discretion
--
the
suspension
of
sentence
discretion
or
even
later
the
grant
or
refusal
parole
by
a
parole
board.
i
apologize
for
a
lot
rather
long,
we
did
answer
to
it.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
at
least
in
the
federal
jurisdiction,
your
honor
and
certainly
in
old
jurisdiction
it’s
an
administrative
decision
although
in
some
state
jurisdictions
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
certainly
here
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
strictly
executive,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
a
judicial
exercise
of
discretion,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
the
reason,
may
it
please,
it’s
not
part
of
the
sentence
is
because
the
judge
has
already
at
the
time
that
he
makes
the
decision
conceptually.
at
the
time
he
makes
the
decision
to
suspend
sentence
and
to
grant
probation
has
made
the
decision
that
this
man
shall
serve
two
or
three
or
four
years
and
the
man
is
liable
to
serve
that
time
whether
he
is
given
probation
or
a
suspended
sentence
or
not.
he
is
liable
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
it
means
that
it’s
a
sentence.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
i
would
not
say
so,
your
honor
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
here
which
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
the
second
one
is
reduction,
as
i
understand
it
under
rule
35,
which
is
quite
different.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
goes
into
the
sentencing
process
--
the
reduction
of
sentence.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
would
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
it
may
be
part
of
the
“sentencing
process”
using
the
words
in
the
rather
broad
sentence,
but
i
would
suggest
that
what
is
the
issue
here
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
prosecution
and
that
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
it
includes
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
it
includes
sentence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
i
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
said,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it
is
part
of
the
--
in
using
the
language
rather
loosely,
normally
part
of
the
sentencing
process,
but
as
we’ve
indicated,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
--
by
the
citation
of
affronti
and
murray
and
ellen
vogan
which
appear
on
pages
14
of
the
--
page
14
of
the
brief.
the
sentencing
--
sentence
may
take
place
and
be
followed
after
an
interval
of
time
under
section
3651,
which
is
the
probation
statute.
it
may
be
followed
after
an
interval
of
time
even
though
the
sentence
was
not
originally
suspended
and
probation
not
originally
granted.
sentence
may
be
followed
after
10
days
or
a
month
or
whatever
interval
of
time
before
execution
occurs.
and
certainly
from
that
point
of
view,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
sentence
has
taken
place
at
the
time
that
the
man
was
told
“you
were
sentence
to
five
years
in
jail
period”
without
any
further
words
of
the
court
as
to
whether
the
sentence
is
suspended
or
probation
given
then
to
give
the
aggress
of
the
hypothesis
your
honor
your
post.
if
the
judge
after,
for
example
of
month
prior
to
the
time
that
the
sentence
is
executed,
thinks
to
himself
of
what
perhaps
the
sentence
should’ve
been
suspended
at
the
end
of
that
30
days
providing
execution
of
the
sentence
has
not
started.
he
has
the
power
and
the
authority
to
exercise
his
discretion
to
suspend
and
grant
probation
for
a
period
of
years.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
if
that
had
taken
place,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
we
would
be
here
although
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
had
--
as
i
say,
mr.
chief
justice
using
the
words
sentencing
process
as
imposing
all
of
the
matters
which
the
trial
judge
is
considering
either
at
the
time
he
imposes
the
sentence
of
the
years
or
during
that
time
including
the
interval
following
that.
that
is
part
of
the
sentencing
process
but
as
the
words
is
used.
the
sentence
is
the
judgment
in
the
berman
case
which
we
cite.
the
prosecution,
may
it
please
the
court,
has
terminated
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
imposing
a
sentence
of
years
and
what
takes
place
after
that
so
far
as
probation,
suspended
sentence
or
parole,
we
would
suggest
does
not
part
of
the
“prosecution.”
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
the
attorneys
who’ve
made
the
arguments,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
obviously
the
judge
has
considered
them.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
statute
this
has
been
interpreted.
this
is
the
difficulty
if
i
can
interrupt
myself
for
a
moment
with
this
--
not
the
difficulty
as
many
cases
of
turn
on
statutory
language,
but
we
suggest
very
strongly
that
whatever
may
be
the
practical
effect
and
what
every
different
ways
judges
and
lawyers
may
deal
with
the
questions
involved
here,
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
way
the
statutes
read
in
particularly
the
wording
the
statute
in
so
far
as
one
statute
refers
the
prosecutions
and
another
statute
refers
to
penalty
forfeiture
liability
that
this
is
a
question
of
--
in
this
case
as
to
how
the
statutes
are
to
be
interpreted
i
would
ask
the
court,
thank
you.[voice

i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
arguments
in
the
brief
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
1
united
states
code
section
109,
i’ve
not
made
that
argument
this
morning.
mr.

that
such
a

was
filed
in
the
district

prior
to
what
being
filed
in
the
court
of

in
any
event,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
this
was
a
prosecution
under
the
prior
drug
law
which
was
repealed
by
public
law
in
91-513
effective
may
1,
1971.
the
indictment,
which
appears
on
pages
2
through
5
inclusive
of
the
appendix,
charged
a
conspiracy
in
several
of
the
counts
between
four
--
between
march
4,
1971
and
march
12,
1971
as
well
as
charging
under
4705
of
former
title
26,
several
--
all
of
the
defendants
the
substantive
offense
of
giving
away
selling
or
the
distribution
of
cocaine.
the
indictment
may
it
please
the
court,
also
charge
in
counts,
which
are
not
material
here,
three
of
the
four
petitioners
was
carrying
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
felony.
the
important
aspect
to
this
case
so
far
as
the
indictment
is
concern
is
that
the
indictment
alleged
that
the
offense
took
place
between
march
4
and
march
10,
1971,
which
was
before
may
1,
1971
the
effective
date
of
repeal
as
a
result
of
91-513
public
law.
91-513
of
the
prior
drug
law,
which
contain
among
other
statutes
26
u.s.
code
section
7237
(d),
which
appears
again
on
pages
three
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
provides
as
your
honors
are
aware
that
upon
conviction
of
offenses
the
penalty
and
i
emphasize
penalty
for
which
is
provided
in
sub-section
(b)
of
this
section
that
the
imposition
or
execution
of
sentence
shall
not
be
suspended,
probation
shall
not
be
granted
and
in
the
case
of
a
violation
of
a
law
relating
to
narcotic
drugs,
section
4202
of
title
18.
the
statutes
otherwise
providing
for
parole
shall
not
apply.
i
would
emphasize
in
connection
of
later
portions
of
the
argument
the
language
in
(d)
of
7237,
which
says,
upon
conviction
of
any
offense,
the
penalty
for
which
is
provided
in
sub-section
(b)
referring
that
in
sub-section
(b)
of
7237,
that
provides,
whoever
conspires
to
commit
an
offense
described
in
4705
(a)
shall
be
imprisoned
not
less
than
five
or
more
than
20
years.
and
in
addition,
may
be
fined
not
more
than
$20,000.
thus,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
accordance
at
least
for
the
language
of
7237
(d),
the
penalty
appears
in
section
(b).
again
and
i'm
hesitant
to
read
statutes
except
that
the
wording
of
the
very
statutes
involved
in
it
here
is
important
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
there
were
two
saving
statutes
involved,
may
it
please
the
court
in
this
case.
the
first
statute
is
the
general
saving
statute,
1
united
states
code
section
109,
which
i
will
read
again
with
some
--
which
i’ll
read
with
some
emphasis.
the
repeal
of
any
statute
shall
not
have
the
effect
to
release
or
extinguish
any
penalty,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“penalty”,
forfeiture,
or
liability
incurred
under
such
statute,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“incurred”
under
such
statute,
unless,
the
repealing
act
shall
so
expressly
provide
and
such
statute
shall
be
treated
as
still
remaining
in
force
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
any
proper
action
or
prosecution
which
i
emphasize,
for
the
enforcement
of
such
penalty,
forfeiture
or
liability.
that
is
the
general
saving
statute,
which
has
been
in
the
statute
book
since
late
in
the
19th
century
unchanged.
the
specific
statute,
which
appeared
in
public
law
91-513
provides
and
again,
i
use
some
emphasis
prosecutions.
i
emphasized
the
word
prosecutions
for
any
of
violation
of
law
and
i'm
reading
from
page
4
of
our
brief
occurring
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
section
1101
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
repeals
or
amendment
made
by
such
section
or
abated
by
reason
thereof.
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice?
we
suggest
here
that
section
1103
(a),
the
specific
saving
statute
which
i
have
just
concluded
reading
controls
this
case
and
under
the
doctrines
of
conflicts
set
forth
in
hertz
against
woodman
and
in
great
northern
railway
against
united
states,
both
of
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
and
in
our
brief
on
pages
9
through
13
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
we
suggest
that
the
conflict
in
wording
between
section
1103
(a),
the
specific
statute
and
section
109,
the
general
statute.
it
is
sufficient
so
that
1103
(a)
is
the
only
saving
statute
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
later
on,
if
time
permits
we
shall
argue
that
even
if
the
court
disagrees
and
109
applies
that
the
same
results
should
still
follow,
but
for
the
moment,
i
address
myself
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
to
the
effect
of
the
specific
saving
statute.
your
honor
and
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court
will
note
that
1103
(a),
the
specific
statute
refers
only
to
the
word
“prosecutions.”
it
does
not
use
the
word
--
words
penalty,
forfeiture,
or
liability,
and
the
contention
of
the
petitioners
resolves
itself,
we
suggest
based
upon
the
meaning
of
the
word
prosecution.
the
government
urges
that
not
withstanding
the
wording
of
the
7237
(d)
that
both
probation,
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
order
a
suspension
of
sentence
and
finally
a
parole
under
18
u.s.
code
4202
is
part
of
the
prosecution
as
the
word
is
used
in
section
1103
(a).
we
disagree
and
there
are
reasons
both
from
a
policy
point
of
view,
as
well
as
from
a
conceptual
point
of
view,
which
we
submit
in
support
of
our
argument.
the
cases
of
affronti
and
murray
and
finally
ellen
vogan
appearing
on
pages
--
which
was
cited
on
pages
14
of
our
brief
and
as
cited
as
well
in
the
united
states’
brief.
all
show
that
the
--
a
court
does
have
authority
following
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
prior
to
the
execution
of
the
sentence
to
grant
probation
and
to
suspend
sentence.
thus,
although
it
did
not
take
place
in
this
case
and
it
does
not
take
place
in
most
cases
as
the
solicitor
general
correctly
points
out.
in
some
case
--
have
the
district
court
here
for
example,
sentenced
these
defendants
to
five
years
not
suspended
sentence
assuming
that
he
had
the
power
to
do
so
and
there
after
before
incarceration
and
while
the
case
was
not
on
appeal
for
example
of
the
court
of
appeals.
if
there
have
been
some
reasons
for
delay
in
execution
of
the
sentence
before
execution
of
the
sentence,
he
had
then
suspended
sentence
and
granted
probation.
he
would
have
been
within
the
authority
which
appears
very
plainly
and
affronti
and
murray
and
in
a
second
circuit
case
ellen
vogan
where
that
actually
took
place.
the
government’s
brief
correctly
points
out
that
as
ellen
vogan
says,
normally,
the
imposition
of
probation
and
the
suspension
of
sentence
should
normally
take
place
at
the
time
of
sentence,
but
the
court
has
authority,
nevertheless
to
suspend
and
to
grant
probation
during
that
interval,
if
there
is
interval
between
imposition
of
sentence
and
suspend
--
and
excuse
me
execution.
thus,
a
sentence
being
in
99%
of
the
cases
is
permanent
indicates
which
is
also
cited
on
page
14
of
our
case.
the
judgment
sentence
has
concluded,
we
suggest
the
prosecution
as
of
the
date,
as
of
the
time
that
it’s
imposed.
sentence,
of
course,
as
we
suggest
looks
to
the
past
or
and
the
judgment
looks
to
the
past.
it
looks
to
the
determination
of
guilt.
it
looks
to
the
considerations,
which
the
trial
judge
takes
into
account
in
determining
the
term
of
imprisonment
or
the
amount
of
the
fine.
it
looks
to
the
prior
criminal
record
if
any
of
the
defendant
or
for
that
matter
to
whatever
good
works
he
has
done
in
his
life.
whereas
probation
looks
to
the
future
--
probation
as
an
act
of
grace
looks
to
the
opportunity
which
the
defendant
may
have
to
rehabilitate
himself
while
instead
of
being
incarcerated
through
the
grace
of
the
court
and
through
the
act
of
grace
which
is
the
suspension
of
sentence
and
probation.
he
finds
himself
to
use
the
colloquial
phrase
on
the
street
rather
than
incarcerated.
so
that
these
are
two
separate
concepts
and
the
difference,
may
it
please
the
court,
between
probation
and
suspended
sentences
and
act
of
grace
on
the
one
hand
and
the
imposition
of
a
term
of
years
on
the
other
hand
as
policy
matters
is
consistent
with
what
we’ve
urged
and
that
the
affronti
and
murray
and
ellen
vogan
cases
shall
namely
that
there
is
a
difference
conceptually
between
the
sentence
and
the
discretion
of
the
court
or
its
exercise
in
impose
in
granting
probations
and
in
suspending
sentence.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
with
respect
to
parole
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
not
trying
to
hedge,
it
does
not
reach
that
because
of
course
we
resentence
after
the
repeal
of
the
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
to
parole,
we
suggest
the
question
is
even
clearer
under
the
language
of
this
court
in
morrissey
against
brewer
which
appears
--
is
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief
408
u.s.
471
at
page
480.
the
court
said,
parole
arises
after
the
end
of
the
criminal
prosecution
including
imposition
of
sentence.
therefore,
even
more
clearly
than
is
the
case
in
probation
in
the
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
the
sentence
has
been
pronounced.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
are
those
similarities
and
of
course
by
saying
that
the
parole
is
--
the
parole
issue
was
strong
here
and
the
probation
issue,
we
certainly
don’t
concede
the
probation
issue.
but
i
would
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
with
respect
to
parole
--
the
determination
for
example
of
when
parole
shall
be
granted
except
in
the
exception
provided
by
4208
(a)
is
an
executive
order
at
least
for
federal
purposes
and
an
executive
rather
than
a
judicial
party.
the
board
of
parole
that
the
matter
except
again
in
the
case
of
the
exception
4208
(a),
the
matter
is
not
a
judicial
matter,
it’s
not
in
the
control
of
the
court,
but
it’s
in
control
of
the
executive
body
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
parole
to
see
how
the
man
does
during
the
time
he’s
been
incarcerated
and
taken
into
consideration
his
background.
and
thereafter,
give
him
the
opportunity
to
remain
in
a
form
of
custody
and
what
the
court
called
a
variation
in
morrissey
against
brewer
upon
imprisonment.
but
again,
on
the
street
under
supervision
of
his
parole
officer
until
the
time
of
his
original
term
has
finished.
so
that
in
that
sense,
may
it
please
the
court,
it’s
like
probation
and
that
he
has
a
form
of
supervision
by
an
executive
–
by
an
employee
of
the
executive,
the
parole
officer.
but
that
the
determination
is
made
completely
separately
from
the
original
determination
made
by
the
court
as
to
the
term
of
years
or
the
fine
in
a
few
cases
where
they
all
find
the
term
of
years
which
the
prisoner,
which
the
defendant
will
serve.
so
that
again,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
suggest
that
the
concepts
are
entirely
different
whether
you
call
parole
of
form
of
an
act
of
grace
or
whatever
terminology
when
puts
on
it.
nevertheless,
there
are
completely
different
considerations
going
into
whether
a
man
is
paroled.
then
the
sentence
imposed
upon
him
whether
that
sentence
is
to
be
suspended
or
served.
now,
coming
back
to
that
for
the
moment
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
with
all
respect
may
it
please
the
court,
parole
except
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
probation?
oh!
yes
--
yes
sir,
there’s
no
question.
but
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
to
grant
probation
and
to
suspend
sentence
certainly
it
is
in
the
exercise
of
some
judicial
discretion,
but
it
comes,
may
it
please
the
court,
after
the
court
has
already
determined
this
man
shall
serve
so
many
years
if
--
that
this
man
shall
serve
so
many
years
that
the
court
then
comes
to
the
question
of
whether
it
shall
exercise
its
discretion
to
grant
probation
coupled
with
a
suspended
sentence,
or
suspended
suspension
of
a
sentence
which
is
already
been
ordered.
and
as
the
nagelburg
indicates
–
case
indicates
on
page
which
we
cited
on
page
16.
if
the
unhappy
in
the
other
happy
event
the
probation
is
eventually
revoke
and
the
sentence
is
ordered
to
be
served
at
some
future
time
during
the
period
of
the
service
of
the
probation
term,
then
to
quote
the
court,
the
original
term
although
suspended
“informs
the
judge
who
revokes
probation
of
what
the
trial
judge
thought
in
appropriate
prison
term
would
be.”
in
that
case,
which
is
helpful
for
our
purposes
in
that
case
one
judge
had
imposed
the
original
sentence
and
suspended
it.
a
second
judge
revoked
the
probation
and
ordered
service
of
the
sentence
and
the
concept
by
the
--
that
the
court
of
appeal’s
voice
in
that
case
was
that
that
what
was
to
be
done
by
the
second
judge
so
far
as
imprisonment
was
concerned
was
already
decided
by
the
first
judge
indicating
again
the
separation
between
the
two
concepts.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
may
it
please.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
perhaps,
to
a
lay
person
not
understanding
the
difference
in
concepts
without
possibility
of
parole,
your
honor
would
normally
as
i
understand
have
resulted
from
authority
of
a
statute
such
as
in
this
case
7237
(d)
for
the
court
to
make
that
order.
and
again,
may
it
please
the
court?
similarly
to
the
power
of
the
federal
court
and
given
by
4208
(a)
to
use
statutory
authority
either
to
order
that
parole
to
be
granted
as
the
case
in
4208
(a)
at
an
earlier
time,
whereas
in
the
case,
your
honor
poses
to
say
that
under
again
under
statutory
authority
that
no
parole
shall
ever
be
given.
again,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
judiciary
or
the
particular
judges
involved
in
that
decision,
but
the
decision
now,
i
would
suggest
is
not
part
of
the
--
is
not
part
of
the
sentence
for
the
purposes
we’re
dealing
with
sentence
here,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
agree
your
honor,
and
there
is
perhaps
a
logical
inconsistency
between
the
case
your
honor
poses
and
the
position
we
take
here
which
is
also
present
as
i
say
in
the
case
of
4208
(a).
but
we
would
suggest
that
in
the
bases
of
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
berman
case,
in
the
roberts
case,
and
the
many
other
cases,
which
have
dealt
with
the
differences
between
either
probation
or
parole
on
the
one
hand
and
the
power
of
the
court
to
sentence
to
a
term
of
years
and
the
fine
or
a
fine
on
the
other
that
so
far
as
the
word
“prosecution”
is
concerned
in
section
1103
(a).
the
specific
saving
statute
that
the
prosecution
has
ended
--
the
prosecution
has
ended,
may
it
please
the
court
with
the
imposition
of
sentence
regardless
of
what
takes
place
afterwards
in
terms
either
of
the
exercise
of
probation
or
suspension
of
discretion
--
the
suspension
of
sentence
discretion
or
even
later
the
grant
or
refusal
parole
by
a
parole
board.
i
apologize
for
a
lot
rather
long,
we
did
answer
to
it.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
at
least
in
the
federal
jurisdiction,
your
honor
and
certainly
in
old
jurisdiction
it’s
an
administrative
decision
although
in
some
state
jurisdictions
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
certainly
here
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
strictly
executive,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
a
judicial
exercise
of
discretion,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
the
reason,
may
it
please,
it’s
not
part
of
the
sentence
is
because
the
judge
has
already
at
the
time
that
he
makes
the
decision
conceptually.
at
the
time
he
makes
the
decision
to
suspend
sentence
and
to
grant
probation
has
made
the
decision
that
this
man
shall
serve
two
or
three
or
four
years
and
the
man
is
liable
to
serve
that
time
whether
he
is
given
probation
or
a
suspended
sentence
or
not.
he
is
liable
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
it
means
that
it’s
a
sentence.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
i
would
not
say
so,
your
honor
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
here
which
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
the
second
one
is
reduction,
as
i
understand
it
under
rule
35,
which
is
quite
different.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
goes
into
the
sentencing
process
--
the
reduction
of
sentence.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
would
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
it
may
be
part
of
the
“sentencing
process”
using
the
words
in
the
rather
broad
sentence,
but
i
would
suggest
that
what
is
the
issue
here
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
prosecution
and
that
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
it
includes
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
it
includes
sentence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
i
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
said,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it
is
part
of
the
--
in
using
the
language
rather
loosely,
normally
part
of
the
sentencing
process,
but
as
we’ve
indicated,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
--
by
the
citation
of
affronti
and
murray
and
ellen
vogan
which
appear
on
pages
14
of
the
--
page
14
of
the
brief.
the
sentencing
--
sentence
may
take
place
and
be
followed
after
an
interval
of
time
under
section
3651,
which
is
the
probation
statute.
it
may
be
followed
after
an
interval
of
time
even
though
the
sentence
was
not
originally
suspended
and
probation
not
originally
granted.
sentence
may
be
followed
after
10
days
or
a
month
or
whatever
interval
of
time
before
execution
occurs.
and
certainly
from
that
point
of
view,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
sentence
has
taken
place
at
the
time
that
the
man
was
told
“you
were
sentence
to
five
years
in
jail
period”
without
any
further
words
of
the
court
as
to
whether
the
sentence
is
suspended
or
probation
given
then
to
give
the
aggress
of
the
hypothesis
your
honor
your
post.
if
the
judge
after,
for
example
of
month
prior
to
the
time
that
the
sentence
is
executed,
thinks
to
himself
of
what
perhaps
the
sentence
should’ve
been
suspended
at
the
end
of
that
30
days
providing
execution
of
the
sentence
has
not
started.
he
has
the
power
and
the
authority
to
exercise
his
discretion
to
suspend
and
grant
probation
for
a
period
of
years.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
if
that
had
taken
place,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
we
would
be
here
although
--
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
had
--
as
i
say,
mr.
chief
justice
using
the
words
sentencing
process
as
imposing
all
of
the
matters
which
the
trial
judge
is
considering
either
at
the
time
he
imposes
the
sentence
of
the
years
or
during
that
time
including
the
interval
following
that.
that
is
part
of
the
sentencing
process
but
as
the
words
is
used.
the
sentence
is
the
judgment
in
the
berman
case
which
we
cite.
the
prosecution,
may
it
please
the
court,
has
terminated
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
imposing
a
sentence
of
years
and
what
takes
place
after
that
so
far
as
probation,
suspended
sentence
or
parole,
we
would
suggest
does
not
part
of
the
“prosecution.”
mr.
william
p.
homans,
jr.
the
attorneys
who’ve
made
the
arguments,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
obviously
the
judge
has
considered
them.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
statute
this
has
been
interpreted.
this
is
the
difficulty
if
i
can
interrupt
myself
for
a
moment
with
this
--
not
the
difficulty
as
many
cases
of
turn
on
statutory
language,
but
we
suggest
very
strongly
that
whatever
may
be
the
practical
effect
and
what
every
different
ways
judges
and
lawyers
may
deal
with
the
questions
involved
here,
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
way
the
statutes
read
in
particularly
the
wording
the
statute
in
so
far
as
one
statute
refers
the
prosecutions
and
another
statute
refers
to
penalty
forfeiture
liability
that
this
is
a
question
of
--
in
this
case
as
to
how
the
statutes
are
to
be
interpreted
i
would
ask
the
court,
thank
you.[voice
overlap]
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
arguments
in
the
brief
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
1
united
states
code
section
109,
i’ve
not
made
that
argument
this
morning.
