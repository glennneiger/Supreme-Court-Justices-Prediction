mr.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
confess
to
be
somewhat
perplexed
by
the
arguments
that
have
been
advanced
including
some
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
in
lower
court
decisions
on
the
question
that
was
before
the
court
this
morning.
as
the
government
sees
the
case,
it
does
not
involve
for
the
court’s
decision
the
question,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
probation
decision
or
the
probation
process
does
not
involve
the
question
of
the
exercise
executive
discretion
to
grant
parole?
what
the
court
has
before
it
in
our
view,
is
a
relatively
straightforward
question
of
legislative
of
intent.
this
is
a
case
involving
two
saving
statutes
and
the
question
is
not
what
is
the
nature
of
probation
or
not
what
is
the
nature
of
parole.
but
rather
when
congress
has
said
that
by
reason
of
engaging
in
certain
illegal
conduct,
a
person
is
absolutely
ineligible
for
probation
and
cannot
even
be
considered
for
parole
that
legislative
direction
is
part
of
punishment
when
engaging
in
that
prohibited
conduct
if
the
answer
to
those
--
to
that
question
is
yes,
if
that
absolutely
legislative
bar
to
the
exercise
of
judicial
discretion
or
of
executive
clemency
is
considered
a
penalty
or
punishment,
then
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
the
ultimate
question
before
the
court
this
morning
is
clear,
that
the
saving
statutes
both
saving
statute
in
title
1
and
the
specific
clause
that
congress
included
in
the
1970
act
operate
to
preserve
these
bands
on
probation
and
parole.
therefore,
i
will
not
--
mr.
lacovara
that
while
the
issues
that
could
be
raise
mr.
chief
justice
is
whether
the
parole
question
is
right.
the
four
petitioners
in
this
case
have
just
been
sentence,
they’re
still
on
bail,
i
understand
and
although
the
probation
decision
is
--
or
the
inability
to
qualify
for
probation
is
clearly
raise.
there
is
a
question
about
the
rightness
of
the
parole
decision.
the
government
acquiesced
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
primarily
because
of
the
importance
of
the
parole
decision
and
i
would
submit
that
the
issue
is
a
live
one
because
the
way
the
system
actually
operates,
the
board
of
parole
is
now
considering
as
eligible
for
parole.
only
defendants
who
have
been
sentenced
in
the
seventh
and
the
ninth
circuits
or
narcotics
offenses
because
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
and
ninth
circuits
upheld
that
people
sentence
after
of
may
1,
1971
are
to
be
considered
eligible.
since
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
as
well
as
other
circuit
courts
have
had
held
that
parole
eligibility
is
not
eliminated.
the
parole
board
will
not
be
considering
any
people
sentenced
in
those
circuits
for
a
parole.
the
petitioners
filed
a
motion
before
the
first
circuit
to
remand
their
case
to
the
district
judge
for
him
to
exercise
probation
discretion
and
also
the
to
certify
whether
they
should
be
eligible
for
parole
if
the
district
judge
has
the
power
to
determine
that
they
are
eligible
for
a
parole,
the
parole
board
--
and
certifies
is
on
his
judgment,
the
parole
board
will
respect
that
judgment.
the
first
--
mr.
lacovara
the
sentencing
hearing
is
not
before
the
court,
that
transcript
is
not
available.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
there
is
a
real
possibility
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
may
have
been
given
probation
if
rozanski
had
the
power
to
do
that.
and
we
point
simply
to
the
fact
that
he
did
sentenced
them
to
the
minimum
sentence
that
was
mandatory
under
the
pre-1970
law
and
also
for
the
three
of
the
petitioners
also
violated
the
gun
control
act
and
judge
rozanski
placed
the
three
petitioners
who
were
convicted
on
those
offenses
on
probation
and
therefore,
we’ve
suggested
that
since
the
record
isn’t
clear
that
he
has
made
a
conscious
decision
on
probation
if
judge
rozanski
has
the
power
that
petitioners
press
for,
then
we
think
that
the
remedy
that
they
sought
in
the
court
of
appeals
remand
for
the
purposes
of
allowing
him
to
consider
probation
or
parole
would
be
inappropriate
remedy.
the
question,
as
we
see
it
is
basically
whether
the
ineligibility
for
probation
and
parole
which
was
unquestionably
contained
in
the
internal
revenue
code
section
7237
(d)
until
it’s
repeal
in
may
of
1971
constituted
a
part
of
the
penalty
for
engaging
in
sales
of
narcotics,
the
offense
of
which
these
petitioners
have
been
convicted.
now,
the
interpretation
of
the
saving
clauses
that
are
before
the
court
will
be
the
ultimate
question,
but
we
think
in
order
to
apply
the
language
of
the
saving
clause
is
it’s
important
to
begin
by
determining
what
is
the
nature
of
the
no
probation,
no
parole
decision
that
congress
has
made
for
narcotics
traffickers.
in
our
brief,
we’ve
said
out
in
some
detail
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
introduction
of
the
no
parole,
no
probation
directive
in
the
statute
and
we
think
that
it
underscores
quite
vividly
that
congress
was
adding
an
additional
penalty
in
the
sense
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
before
said
a
life
sentence
without
parole
is
a
modified
penalty
that
is
more
severe
than
a
simple
life
sentence.
at
least
if
we
submit
as
exactly
what
congress
has
shown
it
was
doing
when
it
added
the
no
probation,
no
parole
provisions
and
applied
them
to
specific
kinds
of
illegal
conduct
violative
of
the
narcotics
laws.
the
no
probation
and
no
suspension
of
sentence
provisions
first
came
in
to
the
narcotics
laws
in
the
1951
boggs
act
which
then
applied
only
to
smuggling
of
heroine
to
the
united
states
and
the
ban
on
judicial
--
judicial
grant
of
probation
or
the
suspension
of
the
sentence
applied
in
1951
only
to
second
or
subsequent
offenders.
in
1956,
however,
in
the
narcotic
control
act
of
that
year
which
is
generally
recognized
to
have
been
a
very
severe
and
harsh
statute.
congress
after
hearing
considerable
amount
of
testimony
about
the
narcotics
statute
tighten
the
screws
and
what
congress
did
was
to
apply
the
no
probation
and
no
parole
--
apply
the
no
probation
provision
not
only
to
second
offenders
involved
in
narcotics
smuggling,
but
applied
the
ban
on
probation
even
to
first
offenders
and
applied
that
prohibition
not
just
to
smugglers,
but
to
any
one
who
dispensed
narcotics
in
violation
of
the
federal
law.
in
addition
in
1956,
congress
added
the
ban
on
parole
making
an
offender
convicted
of
these
narcotics
violations
absolutely
ineligible
for
parole.
congress
denied
district
judges
the
discretion
to
place
people
on
probation
and
it
denied
the
parole
board
the
discretion
to
release
them
before
the
expiration
of
their
sentence.
now,
we’ve
quoted
some
of
the
relevant
excerpts
from
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
1956
legislation
at
pages
12
through
14
of
our
brief.
and
the
very
language
that
was
used
by
the
witnesses
and
by
the
congressional
committees
recommending
this
legislation
shows
that
congress
intended
these
prohibitions
to
be
an
inherent
and
intrinsic
part
of
the
penalties
for
engaging
in
narcotics
trafficking.
thus,
not
only
is
there
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
five
years
for
trafficking
in
narcotics
which
all
courts
of
appeals
and
petitioners
agree
has
been
saved
by
the
saving
statutes
for
pre-repeal
violations
even
if
they’re
not
sentenced
until
after
the
repeal
of
the
1956
act.
but
the
no
probation,
no
parole
directive
by
congress
was
similarly
intended
to
be
part
of
the
penalty
that
was
to
attach
automatically
upon
conviction
of
these
offenses
just
as
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
now
in
1970,
when
congress
passed
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
and
control
act,
and
repealed
the
various
scattered
provisions
of
the
narcotics
laws,
it
eliminated
the
absolute
ineligibility
for
probation
or
parole
that
existed
under
the
1956
legislation.
but
it
did
so,
in
a
somewhat
qualified
way
and
for
reasons
which
are
important
in
answering
the
question
before
the
court.
the
decision
to
eliminate
the
absolute
ineligibility
for
probation
and
parole
that
was
contained
in
section
7237
(d)
was
not,
we
submit
an
exercise
of
legislative
clemency.
it
was
not
an
effort
to
get
soft
on
the
narcotics
problems.
what
congress
was
doing
in
reorganizing
the
entire
drug
control
structure
was
to
make
a
somewhat
more
refined
classification.
even
under
the
1970
legislation,
congress
has
provided
a
category
of
narcotics
offenders
who
will
not
be
eligible
for
probation
and
who
will
not
be
eligible
for
parole.
in
fact,
over
the
opposition
of
certain
witnesses,
congress
even
expanded
that
absolute
probation.
as
i
mentioned,
the
1956
statutes
have
applied
only
to
trafficking
in
narcotics.
section
848
now
of
title
21
which
punishes
engaging
in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
in
the
drug
field
applies
to
engaging
in
any
kind
of
drug
trafficking
including
trafficking
in
lsd,
amphetamines,
and
barbiturates.
in
that
statute,
congress
has
raised
the
mandatory
minimum
penalty
from
five
years
to
10
years
has
increased
the
outer
limit
from
20
years
as
under
the
statute
which
petitioners
violated
to
life
imprisonment
added
in
additional
special
parole
term
increased
the
fine
that
could
be
imposed
and
provided
for
forfeiture.
the
reason
i'm
going
in
to
these
statutes
which
concededly
are
not
directly
applicable
to
petitioners
because
they
didn’t
become
effective
until
two
months
after
they
committed
their
violations,
is
that
it
shows
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
1970.
it
was
not
trying
to
do
what
petitioners’
argument
would
have
the
effect
of
doing
and
that
is
to
wipeout
to
remit
in
part
some
of
the
very
severe
penalties
that
attached
to
people
who
violated
the
pre-1970
laws.
what
congress
was
doing
was
redirecting
its
focus
and
refining
the
categories
of
people
who
would
be
punished
in
a
severe
way.
mr.
lacovara
well,
as
i
mentioned
mr.
justice.
this
was
a
reform
or
revision
of
the
entire
narcotics
structure
it
affected
statutes
that
were
scattered
throughout
the
united
states
code
and
it
also
provided
for
extensive
administrate
changes,
it
enforcement
responsibilities
were
being
transferred
a
whole
new
administrative
system
of
classifying
different
dangerous
drugs
into
various
schedules
was
being
setup.
so,
congress
provided
that
long
lead
time
of
six
months
in
order
to
make
sure
that
all
of
the
actors
in
the
system
would
have
an
adequate
amount
of
time
to
familiarize
themselves
with
the
changes
that
were
being
made
and
to
bring
the
operation
machinery
into
lines
so
that
it
would
be
effective
--
effective
and
a
practical
as
well
as
illegal
sentence
on
may
1,
1971.
mr.
lacovara
well,
no
the
--
i
think
that
turns
it
around
up
until
may
1,
1971
the
provisions
of
the
old
law
were
enforced.
those
were
the
provisions
that
the
petitioners
violated
and
it’s
unquestioned
that
those
provisions
were
the
ones
and
we
contend
still
are
the
ones
that
providing
minimum
sentence
of
five
years
in
jail
and
forbade
the
imposition
--
the
suspension
of
sentence
for
the
granted
probation
or
consideration
for
parole.
so,
we’re
not
talking
about
retroactively
applying
the
--
mr.
lacovara
well,
i
think
it
is
here
or
there
because
that
is
the
dilemma
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
wrestling
with.
there
is
clearly
and
anomaly
at
the
very
least
in
having
to
draw
a
line
and
saying
that
someone
who
committed
a
violation
two
months
before
the
effective
date
is
not
going
to
be
allowed
consideration
for
probation.
it’s
not
going
to
be
eligible
for
parole,
but
somebody
who
commits
this
violation
after
may
1
will
be
eligible
for
these
considerations
unless
he
is
engaged
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
but
this
is
really
an
example
of
congress
having
to
draw
a
line
somewhere.
it
could’ve
draw
in
a
line
in
an
earlier
stage,
but
we
submit
that
legislate
of
history
shows
that
it
didn’t.
mr.
lacovara
no,
sir.
that’s
as
we
underscore
in
our
brief
there
is
just
as
much
challenge
in
the
line
that
they’ve
draw.
in
a
parole
board
case
--
the
noriega
case
which
we’ve
cited
on
the
page
31
of
our
brief,
footnote
18.
the
ninth
circuit
has
--
excuse
me
that’s
not,
noriega
is
page
23
and
24.
the
ninth
circuit
has
drawn
the
line
at
the
date
of
sentencing
irrespective
of
the
date
the
violation
took
place.
the
ninth
circuit
says,
if
your
sentence
after
may
1,
1971,
you’re
eligible
for
probation
or
parole,
but
if
as
might’ve
happen
in
this
case,
petitioners
were
tried
more
promptly
and
were
sentenced
immediately.
the
ninth
circuit
would
say,
even
though
the
new
law
has
come
into
effect
nevertheless,
these
petitioners
are
not
eligible
for
probation
or
for
parole.
what
we
say
is
that,
the
ninth
circuit
has
substituted
its
judgment
on
where
the
line
should’ve
been
draw
or
might’ve
been
draw
for
what
we
think
is
the
legislative
judgment
and
choosing
among
options
that
are
otherwise
reasonable
is
emphatically
a
legislative
judgment.
but
in
this
kind
of
setting,
we
think
it’s
a
particularly
reasonable
judgment.
a
policy
underlying
the
ex
post
facto
clause
for
example
is
one
that
makes
the
consequences
of
conduct
turned
not
on
the
time
--
the
conduct
is
adjudicated
or
sentenced,
but
on
the
time
the
conduct
was
committed
and
this
we
say
exactly
what
congress
has
done.
if
you
committed
your
violation
under
the
old
law,
the
old
law
applies.
if
you
committed
a
violation
of
the
new
law,
the
new
statute
applies.
the
saving
statutes
are
reflective
of
that
national
policy.
the
basic
saving
statute
in
title
1
dates
from
1871
and
it
provides
what
we
think
is
fundamental
national
policy
on
the
interpretation
of
the
effectiveness
of
statutes.
it
provides
in
very
broad
terms
of
the
repeal
of
any
statute
shall
not
have
the
effect
to
release
or
extinguish
any
penalty
forfeiture
or
liability
incurred
under
such
statutes.
so,
here
we
come
back
to
the
date
upon
which
the
penalty
was
incurred
which
would
be
the
date
of
violation
unless
the
repealing
act
expressly
so
provides
will
clearly
express
the
1970
act
has
not
expressly
provided
for
the
extinguishment
of
what
we
think
is
part
of
the
penalty
for
these
violations.
from
a
contrary,
the
statute
is
to
be
treated
as
still
remaining
enforce
for
preserving
a
progress,
civil
action
or
prosecution
to
enforce
that
penalty.
now,
there’s
been
considerable
amount
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
what
those
words
penalty
or
liability
or
forfeiture
mean.
in
the
first
case
that
this
court
had
to
consider
that
question
in
ritzinger
case
1888.
the
court
applied
the
statute
to
a
criminal
case
which
had
--
by
the
way
the
statute
there
had
been
repealed
before
the
indictment
was
returned.
and
the
repealing
statute
itself
just
as
in
our
case
had
its
own
saving
clause
which
was
much
narrow
than
the
general
saving
clause.
it
applied
only
by
its
terms
to
saving
prosecutions
that
had
already
been
commenced
at
the
time
of
the
repeal.
this
court
nevertheless
said
that
the
general
saving
statute
applies
in
addition
that
that
narrower
focus
in
the
specific
saving
clause
is
not
to
be
construed
as
an
expressed
probation
--
provision
to
the
contrary.
and
that
the
words
“penalty,
forfeiture,
or
liability”
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
26
of
our
brief
were
intended
by
congress
to
be
synonymous
with
the
term
“punishment”
and
were
used
by
congress
to
include
all
forms
of
punishment
for
crime.
that’s
why
we
submit
today
that
the
general
saving
statute
1
united
states
code
109
operates
to
save
the
applicability
of
the
no
probation,
no
parole
provisions
of
section
7237
(d).
these
we
believe
and
we’ve
argue
this
in
our
brief
were
part
of
the
penalty
that
congress
created
for
this
violations
and
as
part
of
the
penalty
or
the
punishment
they
are
save
by
the
general
saving
statute.
the
specific
saving
clause
also
points
in
the
same
direction
as
in
ritzinger
and
the
great
northern
railway
case
which
also
involved
were
limited
specific
saving
clause
which
this
court
said
did
not
cut
back
on
the
general
saving
clause
and
allowed
a
subsequently
return
criminal
indictment
to
be
prosecuted.
the
specific
saving
clause
here
reiterates
the
same
national
policy
although
language
is
different,
we
think
the
trust
is
the
same
and
congress
in
the
specific
saving
clause
says,
the
prosecutions
for
any
violation
of
law
occurring
prior
to
the
date.
mr.
justice
blackmun
here
again,
is
the
congressional
focus
on
the
date
of
the
violation
although
that
is
not
the
only
focus
that
congress
might
have
provided
for.
but
these
prosecutions
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
repeals
or
abated
by
reason
thereof.
now,
it
doesn’t
take
much
extravagant
argument
to
show
that
the
punishment
from
offense
is
part
of
the
prosecution
for
it.
prosecution
is
not
just
an
academic
exercise
and
certainly
as
i
believe
petitioners
have
conceded
and
the
lower
courts
have
certainly
held
the
sentence
prescribed
for
a
violation
is
part
of
the
prosecution
for
that
violation
within
the
meaning
of
this
kind
of
saving
clause.
and
if
our
interpretation
of
the
legislative
history
is
correct
that
the
no
probation,
no
parole
provisions
are
part
of
the
penalty
that
operate
automatically
--
attached
automatically
upon
conviction,
then
those
probations
are
part
of
the
sentence
or
part
of
the
prosecution
for
the
offenses
that
took
place
and
are
preserved.
i
think
one
illustration
of
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
that
the
ban
on
probation
and
parole
is
part
of
the
penalty,
part
of
the
punishment
that
congress
has
fixed
for
violation
of
the
statute
is
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are
now
virtually
unanimous
in
holding
that
a
guilty
plea
entered
to
one
of
these
narcotics
offenses
is
involuntary
because
without
sufficient
knowledge,
unless
the
defendant
who
pleaded
guilty
not
only
knew
about
the
minimum
sentence
--
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
but
also
knew
that
upon
conviction,
he
would
be
ineligible
for
probation
and
would
be
ineligible
for
parole.
and
the
rational
the
courts
of
appeals
have
followed
in
reaching
that
result
is
that
unlike
certain
other
collateral
consequences
of
criminal
conviction,
the
ineligibility
for
probation
and
parole
are
attached
to
the
very
violations
itself
in
the
same
sense
that
the
prison
sentence
is
a
consequence
of
the
plead.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
has
reached
the
proper
result
in
holding
that
violations
of
the
pre
may
1,
1971
drug
laws
are
to
be
punished
as
if
those
laws
are
still
in
effect
and
for
all
legal
purposes
under
the
saving
statutes
they
are
to
be
considered
enforced.
mr.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
confess
to
be
somewhat
perplexed
by
the
arguments
that
have
been
advanced
including
some
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
in
lower
court
decisions
on
the
question
that
was
before
the
court
this
morning.
as
the
government
sees
the
case,
it
does
not
involve
for
the
court’s
decision
the
question,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
probation
decision
or
the
probation
process
does
not
involve
the
question
of
the
exercise
executive
discretion
to
grant
parole?
what
the
court
has
before
it
in
our
view,
is
a
relatively
straightforward
question
of
legislative
of
intent.
this
is
a
case
involving
two
saving
statutes
and
the
question
is
not
what
is
the
nature
of
probation
or
not
what
is
the
nature
of
parole.
but
rather
when
congress
has
said
that
by
reason
of
engaging
in
certain
illegal
conduct,
a
person
is
absolutely
ineligible
for
probation
and
cannot
even
be
considered
for
parole
that
legislative
direction
is
part
of
punishment
when
engaging
in
that
prohibited
conduct
if
the
answer
to
those
--
to
that
question
is
yes,
if
that
absolutely
legislative
bar
to
the
exercise
of
judicial
discretion
or
of
executive
clemency
is
considered
a
penalty
or
punishment,
then
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
the
ultimate
question
before
the
court
this
morning
is
clear,
that
the
saving
statutes
both
saving
statute
in
title
1
and
the
specific
clause
that
congress
included
in
the
1970
act
operate
to
preserve
these
bands
on
probation
and
parole.
therefore,
i
will
not
--
mr.
lacovara
that
while
the
issues
that
could
be
raise
mr.
chief
justice
is
whether
the
parole
question
is
right.
the
four
petitioners
in
this
case
have
just
been
sentence,
they’re
still
on
bail,
i
understand
and
although
the
probation
decision
is
--
or
the
inability
to
qualify
for
probation
is
clearly
raise.
there
is
a
question
about
the
rightness
of
the
parole
decision.
the
government
acquiesced
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
primarily
because
of
the
importance
of
the
parole
decision
and
i
would
submit
that
the
issue
is
a
live
one
because
the
way
the
system
actually
operates,
the
board
of
parole
is
now
considering
as
eligible
for
parole.
only
defendants
who
have
been
sentenced
in
the
seventh
and
the
ninth
circuits
or
narcotics
offenses
because
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
and
ninth
circuits
upheld
that
people
sentence
after
of
may
1,
1971
are
to
be
considered
eligible.
since
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
as
well
as
other
circuit
courts
have
had
held
that
parole
eligibility
is
not
eliminated.
the
parole
board
will
not
be
considering
any
people
sentenced
in
those
circuits
for
a
parole.
the
petitioners
filed
a
motion
before
the
first
circuit
to
remand
their
case
to
the
district
judge
for
him
to
exercise
probation
discretion
and
also
the
to
certify
whether
they
should
be
eligible
for
parole
if
the
district
judge
has
the
power
to
determine
that
they
are
eligible
for
a
parole,
the
parole
board
--
and
certifies
is
on
his
judgment,
the
parole
board
will
respect
that
judgment.
the
first
--
mr.
lacovara
the
sentencing
hearing
is
not
before
the
court,
that
transcript
is
not
available.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
there
is
a
real
possibility
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
may
have
been
given
probation
if
rozanski
had
the
power
to
do
that.
and
we
point
simply
to
the
fact
that
he
did
sentenced
them
to
the
minimum
sentence
that
was
mandatory
under
the
pre-1970
law
and
also
for
the
three
of
the
petitioners
also
violated
the
gun
control
act
and
judge
rozanski
placed
the
three
petitioners
who
were
convicted
on
those
offenses
on
probation
and
therefore,
we’ve
suggested
that
since
the
record
isn’t
clear
that
he
has
made
a
conscious
decision
on
probation
if
judge
rozanski
has
the
power
that
petitioners
press
for,
then
we
think
that
the
remedy
that
they
sought
in
the
court
of
appeals
remand
for
the
purposes
of
allowing
him
to
consider
probation
or
parole
would
be
inappropriate
remedy.
the
question,
as
we
see
it
is
basically
whether
the
ineligibility
for
probation
and
parole
which
was
unquestionably
contained
in
the
internal
revenue
code
section
7237
(d)
until
it’s
repeal
in
may
of
1971
constituted
a
part
of
the
penalty
for
engaging
in
sales
of
narcotics,
the
offense
of
which
these
petitioners
have
been
convicted.
now,
the
interpretation
of
the
saving
clauses
that
are
before
the
court
will
be
the
ultimate
question,
but
we
think
in
order
to
apply
the
language
of
the
saving
clause
is
it’s
important
to
begin
by
determining
what
is
the
nature
of
the
no
probation,
no
parole
decision
that
congress
has
made
for
narcotics
traffickers.
in
our
brief,
we’ve
said
out
in
some
detail
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
introduction
of
the
no
parole,
no
probation
directive
in
the
statute
and
we
think
that
it
underscores
quite
vividly
that
congress
was
adding
an
additional
penalty
in
the
sense
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
before
said
a
life
sentence
without
parole
is
a
modified
penalty
that
is
more
severe
than
a
simple
life
sentence.
at
least
if
we
submit
as
exactly
what
congress
has
shown
it
was
doing
when
it
added
the
no
probation,
no
parole
provisions
and
applied
them
to
specific
kinds
of
illegal
conduct
violative
of
the
narcotics
laws.
the
no
probation
and
no
suspension
of
sentence
provisions
first
came
in
to
the
narcotics
laws
in
the
1951
boggs
act
which
then
applied
only
to
smuggling
of
heroine
to
the
united
states
and
the
ban
on
judicial
--
judicial
grant
of
probation
or
the
suspension
of
the
sentence
applied
in
1951
only
to
second
or
subsequent
offenders.
in
1956,
however,
in
the
narcotic
control
act
of
that
year
which
is
generally
recognized
to
have
been
a
very
severe
and
harsh
statute.
congress
after
hearing
considerable
amount
of
testimony
about
the
narcotics
statute
tighten
the
screws
and
what
congress
did
was
to
apply
the
no
probation
and
no
parole
--
apply
the
no
probation
provision
not
only
to
second
offenders
involved
in
narcotics
smuggling,
but
applied
the
ban
on
probation
even
to
first
offenders
and
applied
that
prohibition
not
just
to
smugglers,
but
to
any
one
who
dispensed
narcotics
in
violation
of
the
federal
law.
in
addition
in
1956,
congress
added
the
ban
on
parole
making
an
offender
convicted
of
these
narcotics
violations
absolutely
ineligible
for
parole.
congress
denied
district
judges
the
discretion
to
place
people
on
probation
and
it
denied
the
parole
board
the
discretion
to
release
them
before
the
expiration
of
their
sentence.
now,
we’ve
quoted
some
of
the
relevant
excerpts
from
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
1956
legislation
at
pages
12
through
14
of
our
brief.
and
the
very
language
that
was
used
by
the
witnesses
and
by
the
congressional
committees
recommending
this
legislation
shows
that
congress
intended
these
prohibitions
to
be
an
inherent
and
intrinsic
part
of
the
penalties
for
engaging
in
narcotics
trafficking.
thus,
not
only
is
there
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
five
years
for
trafficking
in
narcotics
which
all
courts
of
appeals
and
petitioners
agree
has
been
saved
by
the
saving
statutes
for
pre-repeal
violations
even
if
they’re
not
sentenced
until
after
the
repeal
of
the
1956
act.
but
the
no
probation,
no
parole
directive
by
congress
was
similarly
intended
to
be
part
of
the
penalty
that
was
to
attach
automatically
upon
conviction
of
these
offenses
just
as
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
now
in
1970,
when
congress
passed
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
and
control
act,
and
repealed
the
various
scattered
provisions
of
the
narcotics
laws,
it
eliminated
the
absolute
ineligibility
for
probation
or
parole
that
existed
under
the
1956
legislation.
but
it
did
so,
in
a
somewhat
qualified
way
and
for
reasons
which
are
important
in
answering
the
question
before
the
court.
the
decision
to
eliminate
the
absolute
ineligibility
for
probation
and
parole
that
was
contained
in
section
7237
(d)
was
not,
we
submit
an
exercise
of
legislative
clemency.
it
was
not
an
effort
to
get
soft
on
the
narcotics
problems.
what
congress
was
doing
in
reorganizing
the
entire
drug
control
structure
was
to
make
a
somewhat
more
refined
classification.
even
under
the
1970
legislation,
congress
has
provided
a
category
of
narcotics
offenders
who
will
not
be
eligible
for
probation
and
who
will
not
be
eligible
for
parole.
in
fact,
over
the
opposition
of
certain
witnesses,
congress
even
expanded
that
absolute
probation.
as
i
mentioned,
the
1956
statutes
have
applied
only
to
trafficking
in
narcotics.
section
848
now
of
title
21
which
punishes
engaging
in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
in
the
drug
field
applies
to
engaging
in
any
kind
of
drug
trafficking
including
trafficking
in
lsd,
amphetamines,
and
barbiturates.
in
that
statute,
congress
has
raised
the
mandatory
minimum
penalty
from
five
years
to
10
years
has
increased
the
outer
limit
from
20
years
as
under
the
statute
which
petitioners
violated
to
life
imprisonment
added
in
additional
special
parole
term
increased
the
fine
that
could
be
imposed
and
provided
for
forfeiture.
the
reason
i'm
going
in
to
these
statutes
which
concededly
are
not
directly
applicable
to
petitioners
because
they
didn’t
become
effective
until
two
months
after
they
committed
their
violations,
is
that
it
shows
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
1970.
it
was
not
trying
to
do
what
petitioners’
argument
would
have
the
effect
of
doing
and
that
is
to
wipeout
to
remit
in
part
some
of
the
very
severe
penalties
that
attached
to
people
who
violated
the
pre-1970
laws.
what
congress
was
doing
was
redirecting
its
focus
and
refining
the
categories
of
people
who
would
be
punished
in
a
severe
way.
mr.
lacovara
well,
as
i
mentioned
mr.
justice.
this
was
a
reform
or
revision
of
the
entire
narcotics
structure
it
affected
statutes
that
were
scattered
throughout
the
united
states
code
and
it
also
provided
for
extensive
administrate
changes,
it
enforcement
responsibilities
were
being
transferred
a
whole
new
administrative
system
of
classifying
different
dangerous
drugs
into
various
schedules
was
being
setup.
so,
congress
provided
that
long
lead
time
of
six
months
in
order
to
make
sure
that
all
of
the
actors
in
the
system
would
have
an
adequate
amount
of
time
to
familiarize
themselves
with
the
changes
that
were
being
made
and
to
bring
the
operation
machinery
into
lines
so
that
it
would
be
effective
--
effective
and
a
practical
as
well
as
illegal
sentence
on
may
1,
1971.
mr.
lacovara
well,
no
the
--
i
think
that
turns
it
around
up
until
may
1,
1971
the
provisions
of
the
old
law
were
enforced.
those
were
the
provisions
that
the
petitioners
violated
and
it’s
unquestioned
that
those
provisions
were
the
ones
and
we
contend
still
are
the
ones
that
providing
minimum
sentence
of
five
years
in
jail
and
forbade
the
imposition
--
the
suspension
of
sentence
for
the
granted
probation
or
consideration
for
parole.
so,
we’re
not
talking
about
retroactively
applying
the
--
mr.
lacovara
well,
i
think
it
is
here
or
there
because
that
is
the
dilemma
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
wrestling
with.
there
is
clearly
and
anomaly
at
the
very
least
in
having
to
draw
a
line
and
saying
that
someone
who
committed
a
violation
two
months
before
the
effective
date
is
not
going
to
be
allowed
consideration
for
probation.
it’s
not
going
to
be
eligible
for
parole,
but
somebody
who
commits
this
violation
after
may
1
will
be
eligible
for
these
considerations
unless
he
is
engaged
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
but
this
is
really
an
example
of
congress
having
to
draw
a
line
somewhere.
it
could’ve
draw
in
a
line
in
an
earlier
stage,
but
we
submit
that
legislate
of
history
shows
that
it
didn’t.
mr.
lacovara
no,
sir.
that’s
as
we
underscore
in
our
brief
there
is
just
as
much
challenge
in
the
line
that
they’ve
draw.
in
a
parole
board
case
--
the
noriega
case
which
we’ve
cited
on
the
page
31
of
our
brief,
footnote
18.
the
ninth
circuit
has
--
excuse
me
that’s
not,
noriega
is
page
23
and
24.
the
ninth
circuit
has
drawn
the
line
at
the
date
of
sentencing
irrespective
of
the
date
the
violation
took
place.
the
ninth
circuit
says,
if
your
sentence
after
may
1,
1971,
you’re
eligible
for
probation
or
parole,
but
if
as
might’ve
happen
in
this
case,
petitioners
were
tried
more
promptly
and
were
sentenced
immediately.
the
ninth
circuit
would
say,
even
though
the
new
law
has
come
into
effect
nevertheless,
these
petitioners
are
not
eligible
for
probation
or
for
parole.
what
we
say
is
that,
the
ninth
circuit
has
substituted
its
judgment
on
where
the
line
should’ve
been
draw
or
might’ve
been
draw
for
what
we
think
is
the
legislative
judgment
and
choosing
among
options
that
are
otherwise
reasonable
is
emphatically
a
legislative
judgment.
but
in
this
kind
of
setting,
we
think
it’s
a
particularly
reasonable
judgment.
a
policy
underlying
the
ex
post
facto
clause
for
example
is
one
that
makes
the
consequences
of
conduct
turned
not
on
the
time
--
the
conduct
is
adjudicated
or
sentenced,
but
on
the
time
the
conduct
was
committed
and
this
we
say
exactly
what
congress
has
done.
if
you
committed
your
violation
under
the
old
law,
the
old
law
applies.
if
you
committed
a
violation
of
the
new
law,
the
new
statute
applies.
the
saving
statutes
are
reflective
of
that
national
policy.
the
basic
saving
statute
in
title
1
dates
from
1871
and
it
provides
what
we
think
is
fundamental
national
policy
on
the
interpretation
of
the
effectiveness
of
statutes.
it
provides
in
very
broad
terms
of
the
repeal
of
any
statute
shall
not
have
the
effect
to
release
or
extinguish
any
penalty
forfeiture
or
liability
incurred
under
such
statutes.
so,
here
we
come
back
to
the
date
upon
which
the
penalty
was
incurred
which
would
be
the
date
of
violation
unless
the
repealing
act
expressly
so
provides
will
clearly
express
the
1970
act
has
not
expressly
provided
for
the
extinguishment
of
what
we
think
is
part
of
the
penalty
for
these
violations.
from
a
contrary,
the
statute
is
to
be
treated
as
still
remaining
enforce
for
preserving
a
progress,
civil
action
or
prosecution
to
enforce
that
penalty.
now,
there’s
been
considerable
amount
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
what
those
words
penalty
or
liability
or
forfeiture
mean.
in
the
first
case
that
this
court
had
to
consider
that
question
in
ritzinger
case
1888.
the
court
applied
the
statute
to
a
criminal
case
which
had
--
by
the
way
the
statute
there
had
been
repealed
before
the
indictment
was
returned.
and
the
repealing
statute
itself
just
as
in
our
case
had
its
own
saving
clause
which
was
much
narrow
than
the
general
saving
clause.
it
applied
only
by
its
terms
to
saving
prosecutions
that
had
already
been
commenced
at
the
time
of
the
repeal.
this
court
nevertheless
said
that
the
general
saving
statute
applies
in
addition
that
that
narrower
focus
in
the
specific
saving
clause
is
not
to
be
construed
as
an
expressed
probation
--
provision
to
the
contrary.
and
that
the
words
“penalty,
forfeiture,
or
liability”
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
26
of
our
brief
were
intended
by
congress
to
be
synonymous
with
the
term
“punishment”
and
were
used
by
congress
to
include
all
forms
of
punishment
for
crime.
that’s
why
we
submit
today
that
the
general
saving
statute
1
united
states
code
109
operates
to
save
the
applicability
of
the
no
probation,
no
parole
provisions
of
section
7237
(d).
these
we
believe
and
we’ve
argue
this
in
our
brief
were
part
of
the
penalty
that
congress
created
for
this
violations
and
as
part
of
the
penalty
or
the
punishment
they
are
save
by
the
general
saving
statute.
the
specific
saving
clause
also
points
in
the
same
direction
as
in
ritzinger
and
the
great
northern
railway
case
which
also
involved
were
limited
specific
saving
clause
which
this
court
said
did
not
cut
back
on
the
general
saving
clause
and
allowed
a
subsequently
return
criminal
indictment
to
be
prosecuted.
the
specific
saving
clause
here
reiterates
the
same
national
policy
although
language
is
different,
we
think
the
trust
is
the
same
and
congress
in
the
specific
saving
clause
says,
the
prosecutions
for
any
violation
of
law
occurring
prior
to
the
date.
mr.
justice
blackmun
here
again,
is
the
congressional
focus
on
the
date
of
the
violation
although
that
is
not
the
only
focus
that
congress
might
have
provided
for.
but
these
prosecutions
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
repeals
or
abated
by
reason
thereof.
now,
it
doesn’t
take
much
extravagant
argument
to
show
that
the
punishment
from
offense
is
part
of
the
prosecution
for
it.
prosecution
is
not
just
an
academic
exercise
and
certainly
as
i
believe
petitioners
have
conceded
and
the
lower
courts
have
certainly
held
the
sentence
prescribed
for
a
violation
is
part
of
the
prosecution
for
that
violation
within
the
meaning
of
this
kind
of
saving
clause.
and
if
our
interpretation
of
the
legislative
history
is
correct
that
the
no
probation,
no
parole
provisions
are
part
of
the
penalty
that
operate
automatically
--
attached
automatically
upon
conviction,
then
those
probations
are
part
of
the
sentence
or
part
of
the
prosecution
for
the
offenses
that
took
place
and
are
preserved.
i
think
one
illustration
of
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
that
the
ban
on
probation
and
parole
is
part
of
the
penalty,
part
of
the
punishment
that
congress
has
fixed
for
violation
of
the
statute
is
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are
now
virtually
unanimous
in
holding
that
a
guilty
plea
entered
to
one
of
these
narcotics
offenses
is
involuntary
because
without
sufficient
knowledge,
unless
the
defendant
who
pleaded
guilty
not
only
knew
about
the
minimum
sentence
--
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
but
also
knew
that
upon
conviction,
he
would
be
ineligible
for
probation
and
would
be
ineligible
for
parole.
and
the
rational
the
courts
of
appeals
have
followed
in
reaching
that
result
is
that
unlike
certain
other
collateral
consequences
of
criminal
conviction,
the
ineligibility
for
probation
and
parole
are
attached
to
the
very
violations
itself
in
the
same
sense
that
the
prison
sentence
is
a
consequence
of
the
plead.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
has
reached
the
proper
result
in
holding
that
violations
of
the
pre
may
1,
1971
drug
laws
are
to
be
punished
as
if
those
laws
are
still
in
effect
and
for
all
legal
purposes
under
the
saving
statutes
they
are
to
be
considered
enforced.
