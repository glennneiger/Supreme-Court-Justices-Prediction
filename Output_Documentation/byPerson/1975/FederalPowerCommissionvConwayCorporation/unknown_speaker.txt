unknown
speaker
but
that’s
made
the
merits
of
your
case?
unknown
speaker
the
gap?
i
thought
the
gap
was
a
power
over
wholesale
rates?
unknown
speaker
and
that
gap
was
closed
by
part
ii.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
got
protection
against
unreasonable
wholesale
rates.
unknown
speaker
well,
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
their
job.
unknown
speaker
well
the
lack
of
protection
against
discrimination
you
suggest
was
part
of
the
so-called
gap?
unknown
speaker
by
the
way,
if
you
were
going
to
try
to
seek
an
antitrust
remedy,
what
antitrust
law
would
you
think
might
be
relevant?
unknown
speaker
attempt
to
monopolize
--
a
monopolization
attempt?
unknown
speaker
and
what’s
your
objection
to
attempting
that
route?
unknown
speaker
parker
against
brown
would
be
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
reasonableness?
unknown
speaker
well,
parker
against
brown
isn’t
going
to
embody
of
your
attacking
a
wholesale
rate.
unknown
speaker
well,
don’t
worry
about
it
then.
unknown
speaker
and
what
about
the
especially
if
the
fpc
claims
it
has
no
authority
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
but
this
aspect
of
a
wholesale
rate,
whether
it’s
discriminatory
or
not,
they
say
they
have
not
authority.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
certainly
have
that.
so
the
parker
against
brown
which
is
only
talking
about
state
authority
anyway
doesn’t
worry
--
it
wouldn’t
bother
you
very
much
with
the
sherman
2,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
that
might
bother
a
court
though?
unknown
speaker
or
fast.
