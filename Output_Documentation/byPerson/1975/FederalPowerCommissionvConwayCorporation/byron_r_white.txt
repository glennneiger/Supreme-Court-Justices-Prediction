justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tuttle,
could
i
ask
you?
i
note
that
mr.
bork
approved
the
filing
of
a
petition
by
the
power
commission.
was
this
approval
required
by
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
the
solicitor
general
isn’t
the
authorized
representative
of
federal
power
commission
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that’s
why
i’m
asking
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
i
take
it
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
views
in
this
brief
are
his
views
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
answer
it
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
is
you
don’t
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
if
he
is
required
to
represent
the
federal
power
commission
before
this
court,
we
do
not
know
whether
we
have
his
views
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
his
view?
do
we
know
whether
we
have
his
views
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
the
answer
is
i
think
we
do
not
know
whether
we
have
his
views
or
not.
now,
does
the
organizational
plan
of
the
department
of
justice
assign
some
responsibility
within
the
department
with
respect
to
the
federal
power
commission
petitions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
now,
just
let
me
ask
you.
is
there
any
evidence
in
these
papers
that
you
have
filed
here
as
to
what
the
views
of
the
antitrust
division
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
it
does
--
i
think
that
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
in
circumstances
where
the
solicitor
general
wishes
to,
he
may
authorize
an
independent
regulatory
agency
with
litigating
power
such
as
our
own
to
file
our
own
petition
which
is
what
he
did
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
last
case
i
have
is
75-342,
federal
power
commission
against
conway.
the
question
in
this
case,
which
also
comes
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
concerns
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
that
agency
has
the
authority
to
set
rates
which
are
charged
by
electric
power
companies
in
making
interstate
sales
at
wholesale.
it
has
no
power
to
regulate
the
rates
with
respect
to
retail
sales.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
conway
corporation,
sells
in
both
wholesale
and
retail
and
it
competes
at
retail
with
it's
wholesale
customers
who
of
course
also
sell
it
retail.
when
conway
sought
to
raise
it's
wholesale
rates,
it's
wholesale
customers
complained
that
the
suggested
new
rates
were
discriminatory
and
anti-competitive.
the
commission
held
that
while
it
had
the
power
over
wholesale
rates,
it
had
no
power
whatsoever
over
retail
rates
and
also
no
authority
to
consider
the
relationship
between
wholesale
and
retail
rates.
it
hence
rejected
the
position
of
the
wholesale
customers
of
conway.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
view,
although
the
commission
has
no
power
to
retail
rates,
it
does
have
power
over
wholesale
rates
and
then
in
considering
whether
the
wholesale
rates
were
just
and
reasonable,
it
not
only
may
but
must
consider
whether
or
not
the
rates
are
discriminatory
and
anti-competitive.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
