mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
serious
question
in
this
proceeding
and
it’s
a
good
deal
broader
i
think
than
the
question
as
stated
by
the
fpc.
looked
at
most
broadly,
i
think
it’s
the
question
here
is
one
of
how
the
federal
power
commission
fixed
into
the
picture
of
the
societal
control
of
basic
economic
structure
of
the
society.
it’s
very
plain
that
sales
of
electricity
have
been
since
the
inception
thereof
regulated
in
one
form
or
another
either
at
common
law
as
common
carriers
of
public
utilities
at
common
law
or
by
agencies
set
up
by
either
states
or
federal
government.
the
fpc’s
position
here
is
one
of
what
i
would
characterized
as
being
selective
myopia.
they’re
looking
at
a
particular
portion
of
a
particular
section
of
a
statute.
i
think
misreading
it.
without
attempting
to
see
how
it
fits
into
the
structure
at
large
or
into
this
whole
set
of
their
statute.
i
have
here
and
i
hope
i
may
be
forbidden
--
forgiving
for
saying
so
a
sense
of
déjà
vu.
three
years
ago,
i
stood
here
while
the
fpc
was
saying
similar
things
in
the
gulf
states
case.
there
it
said
that
it
didn’t
have
to
worry
about
anticompetitive
problems
under
section
204
of
the
federal
power
act
because
it
could
deal
with
such
problems
by
treating
the
actual
problems
when
they
occur,
the
acts
of
the
company
rather
than
the
financing.
and
that
court
--
that
case
is,
well
review
was
being
had
of
a
decision
of
the
courts
below
here
at
the
same
court,
also
unanimous.
in
that
case,
the
majority
of
this
court
agreed
that
the
fpc
did
have
the
responsibility
to
look
at
what
had
then
claimed
was
non-jurisdictional
problems,
anticompetitive
problems
and
to
deal
with
it
within
the
context
of
section
204.
the
minority
of
this
court
and
a
decision
written
by
mr.
justice
powell
agreed
that
the
commission
had
the
responsibility
to
deal
with
anticompetitive
problems
when
the
problem
was
presented
to
it
in
the
course
of
a
case
where
the
conduct
was
being
challenged
such
as
ratemaking.
we
thought
the
fpc’s
position
at
that
time
was
something
of
a
shell
game
and
trying
to
find
jurisdiction
somewhere
else
without
quite
saying
where
it
was
and
we
think
it’s
similar
here.
the
conway
corporation
is
a
corporation
which
was
set
up
during
the
1930’s
in
order
to
raise
some
money
that
couldn’t
be
raised
under
arkansas
law
to
bailout
two
colleges,
your
honor.
it’s
a
city-owned
corporation.
it
and
the
other
eight
customers
here
are
all
publicly-owned.
mr.
tuttle
asserts
that
the
problem
here
must
somehow
be
one
of
discriminatorily
low
retail
rates.
we’ve
stated
at
some
length
the
problems
that
we
see
with
the
federal
power
commission’s
regulations
and
why
that
isn’t
so.
perhaps,
it
stated
best
however
by
a
amicus
brief
which
we
received
i
believe
yesterday
filed
by
commonwealth
edison
to
which
we’re
happy
to
consent
incidentally.
as
they
pointed
out
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
methods,
accepted
methods
of
ratemaking,
differential
allocation,
differential
assumptions
of
rates.
the
fpc
for
example
sets
rates
on
the
basis
of
estimates
of
cost,
not
actual
cost
but
estimates
of
cost
made
by
the
company
in
advance
--
a
year
in
advance.
most
state
commissions
do
not.
arkansas
does
not.
the
fpc
may
or
may
not
be
allowing
various
kinds
of
tax
normalizations.
that’s
not
too
clear.
there
are
lots
of
the
things
like
this.
they’re
spelled
out
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it’s
very
easy
for
a
power
company
to
file
a
higher
rate
at
the
fpc.
the
fpc
does
not
typically
do
anything
with
it
in
the
near
term
future.
and
this
rate
was
filed
in
1973.
hearings
are
not
completed.
we’ve
had
three
judges.
one
is
retired.
one
has
moved
on
to
better
things.
and
that’s
not
uncommon.
recently,
the
fpc
decided
a
rate
case
which
was
filed
in
january
in
1970
and
they
decided
that
in
august
of
last
year.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
oh,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
they
find
out
that
the
case
has
been
processed
in
this
expeditious
manner
as
we
could.
at
the
same
time,
as
this
was
going
ahead.
i
assure
you
we
would
like
very
much
to
get
some
money
back.
we’ve
been
paying
all
this
time.
what
we
contended
originally
was
that
there
is
a
historic
responsibility
and
a
statutory
responsibility
the
fpc
to
avoid
discrimination.
we
said
this
was
a
discrimination
case.
as
a
discrimination
case,
there
is
a
fast
procedure
for
dealing
with
these
matters.
not
one
where
we
are
now
paying
the
second
pancake
rate
increase
without
any
judgment
as
the
first.
the
arkansas
commission
has
had
two
findings
on
the
two
cases
which
have
been
filed
there.
they’ve
cut
them
both
down.
what
we
said,
this
is
a
discrimination
case.
in
a
discrimination
case
you
can
go
ahead
very
quickly.
you
can
decide
if
there
appears
to
be
discrimination
as
it
plainly
does
here.
you
can
require
the
company
to
show
cause.
why
the
discrimination
should
not
be
ended
and
ended
there.
then
you
go
on
to
have
the
rest
of
the
hearing.
eliminate
the
discrimination
if
there
is
still
a
rate
increase
pending.
go
ahead
and
hold
the
rest
of
the
hearing
on
that.
that
we
can
survive.
what
we
can't
survive
and
this
is
not
an
uncommon
problem.
this
problem
has
been
raised
at
the
fpc
and
probably
a
dozen
cases
since
1973.
we
cannot
survive
the
situation
where
the
company
charges
a
much
lower
retail
rate
than
its
wholesale
rate.
then
i’ve
taken
into
account
the
assumption
that
the
cause
of
justification
for
the
difference
is
taken
into
account.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
yes
it
is.
but
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
commission
had
decided
that
this
was
not
a
discrimination
case.
they
would
not
deal
with
it.
they
would
not
allow
us
to
collect
information
on
it.
they
would
not
allow
us
to
put
on
a
case
on
it.
they
wouldn’t
deal
with
it.
and
if
the
commission
is
going
--
if
we
are
going
to
wait
until
after
the
commission
spends
five
years
hearing
the
case,
then
go
to
court
then
spend
the
three
years
that
this
has
taken,
for
example,
to
get
that
issue
decided.
then
go
back.
nobody
is
going
to
be
alive
who’ll
pay
that
and
these
clients
of
mine
are
going
to
be
out
of
business.
and
there
is
a
very
real
and
very
present
problem,
a
serious
one.
now,
we
pleaded
here
a
discrimination
in
historic
terms.
we
also
pleaded
the
discrimination
in
price
squeeze
terms
under
the
sherman
act
under
the
alcoa,
southern
photo
line
of
cases.
the
fpc
concedes
for
this
purpose
--
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
that
must
be
the
basis
upon
which
this
decision
is
made.
and
i
think
in
fact
that’s
--
we
will
have
no
problem
proving
it.
but
the
commission
urges
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
follow
its
reading
of
the
statute.
one
way
in
which
the
statute
could
easily
have
been
written
by
congress
if
it
meant
what
the
fpc
said
it
meant.
it’s
if
it
had
written
at
the
same
way
as
the
fpc
quoted
it
in
its
application
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
misquoted,
just
adding
an
s.
the
commission
isn’t
claiming
that
anymore.
but
this
is
an
element
of
a
very
historic
kind
of
control.
originally,
monopolies
of
this
type
were
controlled
by
common
law.
the
most
common
problem
that
arose
at
common
law
was
when
there
was
discrimination.
and
the
courts
found
no
problem
in
those
cases
in
saying
it
is
very
simple,
just
end
the
discrimination.
we
don’t
have
to
have
worry
about
what
the
costs
are
and
the
discrimination
raise
both
rates
or
lower
them
both.
the
sherman
act
provides
for
a
remedy
under
the
antitrust
laws,
trouble
damage
not
simple
damage.
the
robinson-patman
act,
if
it
applies,
would
provide
for
a
trouble
damage
remedy.
under
part
i
of
the
federal
power
act
or
the
original
water
power
act
of
1920
is
very
clear
that
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
had
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
this
discrimination
and
this
discrimination
precisely
if
there
were
no
state
commission.
arkansas
power
and
light
is
a
licensee
of
the
nation’s
water
resources.
part
i
plainly
makes
the
--
a
licensee
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
avoid
discrimination.
and
that
jurisdiction
terminates
as
to
those
matters
for
which
a
state
provides
a
regulatory
agency
to
deal
but
only
as
to
those
matters.
the
commission
and
arkansas
say
that
there
is
no
state
agency
to
deal
with
this
discrimination.
and
they
say
the
federal
power
commission
can’t
either.
we
think
that’s
wrong.
prior
to
1927,
when
this
court
decided
the
attleboro
case,
it
seemed
clear
that
a
state
commission
could
resolve
this
discrimination
problem.
in
attleboro,
this
court
decided
that
the
so-called
attleboro
gap
existed
that
the
states
could
not
control
sales
at
wholesale
for
resale.
the
federal
power
commission
was
in
1935,
it
is
part
of
the
public
utilities
act
of
1935
given
the
responsibility
to
deal
with
the
matters
which
had
been
left
open
by
this
court
at
attleboro
are
opened.
this
court
has
said
in
numerous
occasions,
most
frequently
fpc
against
florida
power
and
light,
also
in
fpc
against
southern
california
edison
that
congress
intended
fully
to
plug
the
so
called
attleboro
gap
to
fill
that
responsibility.
but
the
fpc
here
says,
no,
they
don’t.
mr.
tuttle’s
position
is
sort
of
strange.
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
follow
it.
i
understand
him
to
say
that
the
fpc
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
wholesale
rates.
and
therefore,
i
presume
that
he
will
argue
that
we
cannot
attack
the
wholesale
rates
as
being
part
of
a
price
squeeze
if
we
go
into
antitrust
court
or
where
this
is
to
go.
the
state
commission
would
undoubtedly
urge
at
parker
against
brown
applied,
certainly
if
it
applies
to
light
bulbs
it
applies
to
rates.
this
court
has
before
the
question
whether
it
applies
to
light
bulbs
and
how
far
it
goes
in
the
detroit
edison
case.
but
suppose
we
were
good
to
go
to
court
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
court
would
presumably
award
us
damages
and
continuing
damages
to
the
extent
of
the
discrimination.
in
substance
therefore,
we
would
be
going
the
court
to
get
the
damages
which
the
fpc
could
have
awarded
us
because
of
the
differential
in
rates,
the
discrimination.
that
seems
a
rather
roundabout
way
and
unnecessary
burden
upon
the
courts
to
do
something
which
the
fpc
has
the
expertise
to
do.
if
the
suggestion
is
that
we
should
go
to
court
and
we
get
an
order
directing
the
company
or
the
state
commission
to
raise
the
rates,
then
we
are
doing
by
interaction
precisely
what
the
people
who
objected
to
the
original
draft
of
part
ii
in
1935
objected
to
judge
hooker
from
the
state
corporation
commission
in
virginia
in
1935.
objected
that,
and
it’s
in
our
brief
that
if
that
language
was
not
changed,
the
fpc
would
have
the
authority
that
the
icc
had
had
to
come
into
virginia
or
any
state
and
force
it
to
raise
the
retail
rates.
and
that
was
why
i
think
the
reading
of
the
legislative
history
makes
it
quite
clear
that
that’s
why
the
amendments
that
were
made
were
made
to
prevent
the
fpc
from
directly
going
in
and
requiring
retail
rates
to
be
raised.
mr.
tuttle’s
solution
would
apparently
have
us
do
that
indirectly
by
a
court
order.
there
are
constitutional
problems
with
that
as
well
but
i
don’t
think
we
need
to
get
into
those.
some
of
the
amici
say
we
should
go
to
the
state
agencies
and
ask
them
to
raise
their
rates.
there
is
indeed
a
standing
problem.
we
have
tried
this
for
a
couple
of
our
clients
in
other
cases
and
we
have
been
thrown
out.
indeed
in
the
arkansas
case,
some
of
our
clients
here
attempted
to
intervene
for
limited
purposes.
and
we’re
allowed
to
intervene
for
very
limited
purposes,
much
more
limited
than
what
would
be
allowed.
but
the
problem
is
we
don’t
think
that
the
state
agencies
are
wrong
in
the
way
they
set
rates.
the
fpc
is
prepared
to
allow
much
higher
rates.
they’re
prepared
to
do
it
on
a
different
basis.
and
the
state
commission
said
he’s
believed
that
they
have
a
responsibility
to
their
citizens
as
well
and
to
other
citizens.
and
we
don’t
believe
it’s
our
responsibility.
we
don’t
believe
it’s
right
to
go
to
court
and
say,
arkansas
power
and
light
raise
your
retail
rates.
we
have
no
problem
with
the
way
the
arkansas
public
service
commission
is
setting
those
rates.
our
problem
is
with
the
fpc.
the
fpc
suggests
that
there
is
a
magic
to
the
way
it
sets
wholesale
rates.
but
that’s
easily
answered.
if
there
were
as
there
are
in
some
instances
two
wholesale
rates,
one
by
arkansas
power
and
light
to
an
affiliate
which
then
sold
at
retail
and
the
area
where
it
sells
and
one
to
us.
the
fpc
would
have
no
problem
with
saying
lower
the
higher
rate
or
raise
them
both
and
the
discrimination
and
then
set
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
but
end
the
discrimination
first.
in
this
case,
they
say,
well,
somehow
or
another,
there
is
a
magic
to
the
way
we
set
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
we’ll
get
to
it
five
or
six
years
down
the
road
and
you’ll
then
be
saved,
maybe.
but
we
won’t
do
anything
about
the
discrimination.
that’s
not
a
satisfactory
answer
or
we
don’t
find
it
a
satisfactory
answer.
the
fpc
was
set
up
to
fill
the
attleboro
gap
not
to
reopen
it.
before
the
attleboro
decision,
we
wouldn’t
have
had
the
discrimination
problem.
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
is
there
any
suggestion
that
it
was
intended
to
reopen
this
kind
of
a
gap
to
leave
us
hanging
out
there
exposed
to
the
worse
kind
of
discrimination.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
indeed,
your
honor.
the
gap
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
was
it?
if
it
was
closed,
your
honor,
where
is
our
protection
against
discrimination?
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
we
have
protection
against
what
the
fpc
decides.
our
unreasonable
wholesale
rate
after
the
fpc
finally
decides
it
five
years
down
the
road.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
if
we’re
still
around.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
it
may
be
their
job,
your
honor.
but
we
say
that
before
the
gap
was
open,
we
had
protection
against
discrimination
in
the
interim
while
people
were
deciding
what
the
reasonable
wholesale
or
retail
rate
was.
after
that
decision,
we
didn’t
unless
we
go
to
court.
the
fpc
seems
to
say
--
plainly
says,
that
they
can't
give
us
their
protection.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
yes,
your
honor.
when
the
gap
was
opened,
prior
to
the
time
the
gap
was
opened
all
such
sales
were
thought
by
most
states
to
be
regulated
by
them.
i
don’t
know
of
any
state
agency
that
does
not
have
a
discrimination
provision
in
its
charter.
and
that’s
the
very
element,
the
very
basic
element
of
regulation
of
utility
rates
or
indeed
or
anything
else
in
the
kind
of
required
monopoly
service
in
this
society.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
sherman
2,
i
would
think.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
our
objection
to
attempting
that
route
--
our
only
real
objection
to
attempting
that
route,
your
honor
is,
are
two.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
parker
against,
well,
the
first
question
is
can
it
be
done.
and
there
you
have
the
montana
dakota
utilities
case
which
this
court
decided
in
1947,
i
think.
seems
to
say
that
as
to
a
fpc
rate,
the
only
place
you
can
show
unto
that
is
at
the
fpc.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
no,
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
possibly.
i
certainly
don’t
want
to
preclude
that
possibility
in
off
shares
that
we
lose.
[laughter]
obviously,
we
would
have
to
try
that.
the
other
problem
is
parker
against
brown.
but
in
substance,
what
you
would
be
doing
is
you
have
to
go
back
into
the
cost
justification,
exactly
the
same
kinds
of
sticky
problems
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
okay.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
i
don’t
understand
that
to
be
saying
that
quite,
your
honor.
they’ve
said
a
very
carefully
phrased
thing.
they
have
said
in
a
footnote
to
their
main
brief
that
they
have
exclusive
authority
over
wholesale
rates.
but
that
we
can
go
sue
about
the
low
retail
rates
which
they
hypothesized.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
they
certainly
say
they
have
no
authority
over
it.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
no,
not
if
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
it
might.
not
if
the
primary
question
is
the
wholesale
issue
and
this
court
made
clear
that
the
wholesale
problem
is
not
precluded.
second
problem,
however,
is
one
of
costs.
now,
i
do
not
suggest
for
one
minute
that
fpc
proceedings
are
cheap.
mr.
robert
c.
mcdiarmid
or
fast.
neither,
however,
are
sherman
2
cases.
now,
arkansas
power
and
light
in
its
current
filing
claims
something
like
$80,000.00
in
regulatory
expenses
for
the
year
which
they
want
us
to
pay
of
course
for
their
wholesale
case.
now
we
have
to
pay
that
and
the
fpc
will
charge
it
to
us.
there
are
other
things
probably
in
there
too.
in
companies
that
break
it
out
entirely
as
regulatory
expense,
i’ve
seen
it
as
high
as
500,000
a
year.
intervenors
have
to
spend
money
too,
not
quite
at
that
rate.
thank
god!
but
they’re
still
expensive.
but
they
aren’t
as
expensive
as
trouble
damage
cases.
the
other
problem
i
think
is
really
one
of
the
proper
functions
for
the
courts.
as
i
was
beginning
to
say
the
states
and
the
federal
government
found
beginning
with
the
actual
rate
to
regulate
commerce
in
the
1890’s
that
regulation
by
court
are
rather
technical
and
detailed
and
long,
problems
with
cost
justification.
we’re
taking
an
awful
lot
of
time
or
not
something
with
which
the
courts
had
or
wanted
in
any
particular
expertise.
the
arkansas
power
and
light
case
on
cost
justification
is
now
on
30
days,
i
guess,
of
hearing.
some
of
them
had
gone
as
long
as
70
at
the
fpc
and
they
--
not
inappropriate
questions.
that’s
not
a
kind
of
burden
i
would
want
to
see
imposed
on
the
court
system.
at
the
rate
that
the
problems
are
piling
up
at
the
fpc
which
does
have
the
expertise
whatever
else
it
does
or
doesn’t
have,
i
think
it
is
plain
that
we
would
put
in
a
tremendous
burden
upon
the
district
court
system
in
one
which
i
don’t
think
very
many
district
judges
would
like
to
bear
or
should
be
asked
to
bear.
your
honor,
it’s
a
very
serious
problem.
i
--
we
think
there’s
an
easy
answer
to
it.
it’s
the
answer
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
gave,
we
don’t
think
in
its
entirety.
i’m
not
--
in
traditional
discrimination
terms,
the
range
of
reasonableness
whatever
it
may
be
is
not
the
whole
answer.
the
fpc
claims
there
is
no
range
of
reasonableness.
my
colleague
just
handed
me
a
case
where
the
fpc
said
there
is
a
range
of
reasonableness,
we’re
picking
the
higher
range,
a
higher
into
the
range
just
after
conway
came
down.
the
fpc
is
the
place
that
has
the
authority
to
deal
with
it.
it’s
a
place
set
up
to
deal
with
it,
can
deal
with
it
fairly
rapidly
on
the
traditional
kind
of
discrimination
basis.
we
ask
you,
your
honor,
to
close
the
gap
the
fpc
wishes
to
open
which
we
thought
was
closed
in
1935.
thank
you.
