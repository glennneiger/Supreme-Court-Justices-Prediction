justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tuttle,
you
didn’t
in
your
petition
i
know
raised
the
question
of
the
finality
of
the
commission’s
ruling
that
was
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
from
your
own
knowledge,
is
it
a
common
practice
in
the
agency
proceedings
where
petition
for
intervention
has
been
partially
granted
and
partially
denied
by
the
commission
for
the
party
that
is
partially
denied
to
run
to
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
stage
and
seek
together
reviewed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
conway’s
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
municipality
of
conway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
just
said
the
commission
could
consider
it
and
not
that
it
was
required
to
consider
it,
would
you
regard
that
holding
as
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tuttle,
is
it
not
true
that
in
making
the
determination
of
reasonableness
on
the
wholesale
rate,
you
do
have
to
make
some
preliminary
judgment
as
to
whether
costs
are
probably
allocated,
do
you
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
not
involve
some
inquiry
under
the
rate
base
for
the
retail
rates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
the
statute
makes
it
impermissible
for
you
to
look
and
see
--
assume
hypothetically
that
the
retail
rates
were
much
lower
than
the
wholesale
rates
and
the
jurisdiction
rate.
you
couldn’t
even
consider
that
fact
in
deciding
whether
the
wholesale
rates
are
reasonable,
that’s
your
position
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
example
might
suggest
to
suspicion
that
there’s
something
wrong
with
the
costs.
couldn’t
you
even
look
at
it
for
that
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
including
rates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
including
the
retail
rates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
percentage
of
this
company’s
business
is
retail
and
what
percent
wholesale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
may
not
look
at
those
rates
at
all
in
your
--
performing
your
function,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tuttle,
if
the
facts
are
as
alleged
by
the
intervenor
--
intervenors
here.
do
they
have
any
remedy
at
all
for
the
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
artificially
depress
their
rates
for
90%
of
their
business
in
order
to
do
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
price
squeeze
can
arise
in
two
ways,
either
by
having
extravagantly
high
rates
in
the
wholesale
field
in
normal
rates
in
retail
or
vice
versa.
and
here,
i
assume,
with
90%
of
the
business
in
retail,
they
probably
didn’t
depress
those
rates,
anything
the
wholesale
rates
will
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
accepting
that
what
is
their
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
you’ve
done
an
adequate
job
of
investigating
the
company
and
the
total
cost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
now
a
good
answer
to
my
question,
what
is
their
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
have
standing
because
they’re
not
--
they
have
no
interest
in
that
rate
anymore
than
--
don’t
they
have
the
same
problem
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
back
up,
to
be
sure
i
understand
you.
assume
there’s
no
pending
state
proceeding
before
the
arkansas
state
commission,
what
do
they
do?
do
they
go
in
and
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
file
a
complaint
with
the
state
commission
and
say
that
you
should
cause
the
utility
to
charge
higher
prices?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
that
ever
been
successful?
i
never
heard
of
such
a
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that’s
not
our
example
because
our
problem
is
they
don’t
have
such
a
pending
proceeding
under
our
hypothesis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
conway
do
about
the
problem
that
it
alleges
exists
if
there’s
no
pending
arkansas
state
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
not
the
utility
have
a
complete
defense
because
both
of
those
rates
are
compelled
by
regulatory
agencies
and
then
wouldn’t
parker
against
brown
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
assume
a
situation
in
which
the
rate
--
the
state
rate
has
been
approved
by
the
state
agency?
isn’t
that
a
sufficient
expression
of
state
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
they
don’t
approve
it
without
looking
at
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
has
no
remedy
then?
and
the
answer
is
the
plaintiff
has
no
remedy
--
or
the
intervenor
has
no
remedy
because
i
suppose
they
cannot
look
at
the
wholesale
rate
anymore
than
you
can
look
at
the
retail
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
rate
filed
in
investigation,
they
didn’t
--
they
let
it
go
into
effect.
it’s
the
normal
procedure.
