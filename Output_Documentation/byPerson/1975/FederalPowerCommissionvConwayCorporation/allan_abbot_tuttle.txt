mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
has
the
statutory
authority
to
reduce
a
public
utility’s
otherwise
just
and
reasonable
electric
wholesale
rate
because
the
utility
allegedly
maintains
artificially
depressed
and
anticompetitive
retail
rates.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
it
is
not
a
common
practice
and
of
course
when
it
occurs,
the
commission’s
position
would
ordinarily
be
and
indeed
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
issue
was
premature.
as
you
know,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
disagreed
with
that
argument
which
we
made
indicated
that
the
commission
had
obviously
reached
a
final
conclusion
as
to
this
issue
and
that
the
interest
of
justice
required
the
court
to
reach
the
issue
at
that
juncture
because
the
commission
had
made
that
ruling
in
a
number
of
other
cases
and
the
court
felt
that
there
was
no
indication
that
any
further
elaboration
of
that
issue
would
help
resolve
the
question
of
the
commission’s
power
at
that
juncture.
the
court
of
appeals,
having
made
that
ruling
and
having
reached
the
merits
of
the
case,
we,
of
course,
proceeded
that
this
court
addressing
the
merits
of
the
commission
statutory
power.
this
litigation
arose
in
june
of
1973,
when
arkansas
power
and
light
filed
with
the
commission
a
wholesale
rate
increase
request
under
section
205
of
the
federal
power
act.
conway
corporation,
the
respondent
here
is
a
wholesale
customer
of
arkansas
power
and
intervened
in
the
proceedings
alleging
that
the
filing
was
made
for
anticompetitive
purposes.
conway
asserted
that
it
competed
with
arkansas
power,
its
supplier,
for
direct
sales
of
electricity
to
industry.
and
conway
alleged
that
by
raising
the
wholesale
rate
to
it
while
keeping
the
retail
rate
to
industry
low,
arkansas
power
was
effectively
squeezing
conway
out
of
competition
for
direct
industrial
sales.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
conway
is
a
--
there
is
a
municipal
electric
system
in
conway
and
conway
corporation
manages
it.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
yes,
your
honor.
conway
urged
that
the
increase
be
rejected
or
reduced
in
order
to
eliminate
this
price
squeeze.
federal
power
commission
rejected
this
suggestion
concluding
that
the
relief
sought,
the
rejection
or
reduction
of
the
wholesale
rate
increase
was
not
within
its
power
to
grant.
under
section
205
of
the
federal
power
act,
the
commission
is
charged
with
assuring
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
wholesale
electric
rates
in
interstate
commerce.
it
has,
however,
no
authority
to
set
retail
rates.
the
federal
power
commission
concluded
that
it
could
not
as
conway
was
suggesting
based
the
wholesale
rate
on
the
non-jurisdictional
retail
rates.
the
commission
said
and
this
occurs
at
page
53
of
the
record,
“wholesale
rates
must
recover
allocated
wholesale
costs.
conway
suggested
relief
as
a
rate
not
related
to
wholesale
costs
but
rather
related
to
arkansas
power’s
industrial
rate.”
“however,
that
industrial
rate,”
the
commission
said,
“is
subject
to
the
sole
jurisdiction
of
the
state
commission
and
not
the
federal
power
commission.”
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
a
responsibility
under
sections
205
and
206
of
the
federal
power
act
to
remedy
an
alleged
discrimination
between
a
jurisdictional
wholesale
rate
and
a
non-jurisdictional
retail
rate
cause
by,
and
these
are
the
court’s
words,
“the
utility’s
own
decision
to
depress
certain
retail
revenues
in
order
to
curb
retail
competition
from
its
wholesale
customers.”
the
operative
statute
here
in
section
205
(b)
of
the
federal
power
act
which
provides,
“no
public
utility
shall
with
respect
to
any
transmission
or
sale
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
maintain
any
unreasonable
differences
in
rates,
charges,
services,
facilities
or
in
any
other
respect
either
as
between
localities
or
classes
of
service.”
the
scope
of
this
provision
and
most
significantly
the
significance
of
the
limiting
language
with
respect
to
any
transmission
or
sale
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
can
only
be
understood
with
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1935
power
act,
and
perhaps
more
important,
the
impact
of
this
court’s
1914
decision
in
the
shreveport
case
upon
that
legislative
history.
briefly,
shreveport
involved
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
remedy
a
discrimination
between
jurisdictional
wholesale
railroad
rates
and
non-jurisdictional
intrastate
railroad
rates
set
by
the
texas
railroad
commission.
based
on
this
court’s
view
of
the
broad
and
unexceptional
language
of
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
this
court
in
1914
concluded
that
the
commerce
commission
could
require
an
increase
of
a
non-jurisdictional
intrastate
rate
which
discriminated
against
interstate
commerce.
the
shreveport
case
figured
prominently
in
the
1935
debates
or
hearings,
i
should
say,
on
the
wheeler-raybum
bill
which
with
modification
became
the
federal
power
act
of
1935.
section
202
of
the
original
bill,
the
forerunner
of
section
205,
provided
in
part,
“no
public
utility
should
establish
or
maintain
any
unreasonable
difference
as
to
rates,
charges,
service,
facilities,
or
in
any
other
respect
either
as
between
localities
or
as
between
classes
of
service.”
at
the
hearings
on
the
bill,
the
solicitor
of
the
federal
power
commission
who
was
a
draftsman
of
the
bill
was
asked
if
the
shreveport
case
would
apply
if
the
retail
rates
were
so
low
that
for
a
company
to
exist,
it
became
necessary
to
charge
exorbitant
rates
for
its
wholesale
interstate
business.
he
argued
that
it
would
not
apply
to
the
bill
as
drafted
and
maintained
and
this
is
a
quote.
“the
intrastate
rate
should
be
determined
upon
its
reasonable,”
excuse
me
i
misspoke.
“the
interstate
rate,
the
jurisdictional
rate,
should
be
determined
upon
its
reasonableness.
its
reasonableness
alone
without
regard
to
what
the
intrastate
rate
is.”
despite
these
and
other
assurances
as
the
scope
of
the
wheeler-raybum
bill,
the
concern
remained
that
owing
to
the
broad
and
unexceptional
language
of
section
202
that
i’ve
read
to
you,
that
the
shreveport
case
might
nonetheless
govern
the
law
if
enacted
in
those
terms.
accordingly,
the
act
was
amended
--
the
bill
was
amended
and
the
words
added
which
became
the
words
of
section
205.
section
205
as
enacted
provided,
no
public
utility
shall
and
these
are
the
added
words
to
which
i
want
to
call
your
attention.
no
public
utility
shall
with
respect
to
any
transmission
or
sale
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
maintain
any
unreasonable
differences
in
rates,
etcetera.
following
these
amendments,
representative
cole,
who
was
a
sponsor
of
the
bill,
stated,
“we
have
tried,
i
think,
successfully
to
avoid
the
interjection
of
federal
control
into
intrastate
activities
in
a
way
in
which
the
shreveport
case
might
permit.”
this
wording
of
the
act
has
led
justice
jackson
concurring
in
colorado
interstate
to
make
the
only
statement
that
a
member
of
this
court
has
made
on
precisely
the
issue
involved
in
this
state
--
in
this
case.
and
he
said
at
324
u.s.
at
615,
the
act
forbids
discrimination
only
as
between
regulated
rates
and
does
not
forbid
discrimination
between
regulated
and
unregulated
ones.
despite
this
legislative
history,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
section
205,
as
enacted,
did
not
require
that
both
rates
involved
in
the
pattern
of
discrimination
fall
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
the
court
argued
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
limit
section
205
to
competitions
merely
between
jurisdictional
rates,
it
would’ve
added
to
the
end
of
the
section
the
following
words,
classes
of
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
rather
than
as
the
act
reads
merely
the
words
classes
of
service.
thus,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
congress
had
wished
to
limit
section
205
to
discriminations
between
jurisdictional
sales,
this
is
what
it
would
have
had
to
have
said,
no
public
utility
shall
with
respect
to
any
transmission
or
sale
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
maintain
any
unreasonable
differences
in
rates
between
classes
of
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
however,
the
repetition
of
the
phrase
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
at
the
end
of
section
205
is
obviously
redundant
because
by
its
terms
the
statute
is
already
limited
to
quote
“any
transmission
or
sale
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission”.
based
on
congress’
failure
to
repeat
this
obviously
redundant
phrase,
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
the
commission
was
required
to
address
the
question
or
the
issue
of
discriminations
between
jurisdictional
and
non-jurisdictional
rates.
its
only
concession
was
to
say
that
any
sanction
imposed
by
the
fpc
to
remedy
in
any
competitive
practice
is
to
be
addressed
to
the
jurisdictional
rate.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i
would
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
the
--
our
principal
analysis
of
the
statute
is
that
we
are
limited
in
the
matters
that
we
are
to
concern
ourselves
with,
with
matters
which
may
not
be
the
subject
of
state
regulation.
and
our
view
of
our
statute
is
that
the
only
discrimination
which
we
may
address
within
the
ambit
of
section
205
and
206
is
the
discrimination
between
jurisdictional
rates.
and
that
is
our
fundamental
submission
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
absolutely.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
well,
it
involves
an
allocation,
as
you
say,
of
costs.
and
there’s
no
question
that
we
may
look
to
the
retail
business
to
the
extent
of
determining
that
the
wholesale
rate
and
the
wholesale
rate
payers
are
not
being
loaded
with
more
costs
than
would
justify
according
to
the
amount
of
the
investment,
which
is
put
to
that
service.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
my
position
is
that
the
wholesale
rate
has
to
look
at
properly
allocated
wholesale
costs.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
we
can
always
look
at
the
entire
company’s
business
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
--
in
order
to
determine
that
the
costs
are
correctly
allocated.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i
don’t
think
the
retail
rate
would
be
relevant.
i
think
the
relevant
issue
would
be
the
allocation
of
the
costs.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
it’s
a
hard
thing
to
be
absolutely
specific
about
because
it’s
hard
to
classify
some
of
the
business
but
between
80
and
90%
retail,
the
revenue
is
80
to
90%
retail.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
we
may
look
at
the
rate
based
in
the
allocation
of
costs
but
we
may
not
look
at
that
rate.
our
job
is
to
determine
first
what
is
properly
allocated
to,
in
terms
of
cost
to
the
wholesale
business.
and
then
determine
whether
or
what
is
the
appropriate
rate
of
return
on
that
investment.
and
that’s
what
congress’
charged
as
we’re
doing
here
as
we
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
they
have
several
remedies
in
my
view,
mr.
justice.
they
have
--
of
course
if
this
is
an
artificially
depressed
retail
rate,
which
in
my
view
it
has
to
be
assuming
the
allegation
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i
said,
well,
i
didn’t
see
--
i'm
not
saying
for
a
moment
mr.
justice
that
a
price
squeeze
really
exists
here.
we
are
dealing
with
the
face
of
a
pleading
that
alleges
a
price
squeeze.
so
i
assume
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
well,
they
probably
didn’t
depress
any
rates.
my
point
is
that
it’s
like
i'm
dealing
with
this
thing
on
the
face
of
a
pleading.
and
those
i
have
to
accept
the
allegation
that
there
is
a
price
squeeze
and
an
unlawful
price
squeeze
because
the
respondents
says
so
and
we
refuse
to
hear
their
argument.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
well,
first
of
all,
i’d
like
to
address
the
question
of
the
fact
that
if
you
say
could
occur
from
artificially
inflated
wholesale
rate.
and
i’ll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
but
the
point
i’d
like
to
make
just
initially
is
that
our
ordinary
rate
making
standards
with
respect
to
the
wholesale
rate
would
forbid
inflated
wholesale
rates
and
inflated
wholesale
costs
without
looking
to
the
issue
of
discrimination.
so
it’s
not
going
to
rise
under
our
own
standards.
it’s
not
going
to
rise
on
the
wholesale
side.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
but
we
accept
our
responsibility
and
it
hasn’t
been
questioned
in
this
case
that
we
have.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
well,
their
remedy,
assuming
that
i
am
right,
that
the
rate
is
cost
by
a
depressed
retail
rate.
of
course,
that
is
a
matter
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
commission.
and
they
could
intervene
in
rate
proceedings
in
the
state
commission
and
alleged
that
it’s
an
improper
remedy.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
no,
because
that
would
be
a
rate
that
if
our
other
assumptions
are
correct
is
a
rate
that’s
artificially
low
in
any
competitive.
and
although
the
retail
--
the
state
commission
might
say,
“well,
we
have
to
look
at
our
rate
and
our
rate
by
itself.”
and
i
would
say
they
would
be
right
saying
that.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
well,
they
could
make
a
complaint.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
that’s
one
remedy.
of
course
another
remedy
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i
don’t
know,
i
know
there
had
been
interventions
in
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
conway
now
has
such
a
pending
proceeding?
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
no.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
it
could
file
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
rate
is
improper.
and
that’s
only
one
remedy,
mr.
justice.
it
would
seem
that
under
the
ordinary
standards
of
the
antitrust
law
that
if
an
artificially
--
if
there
is
a
price
squeeze
caused
by
a
manufacturer
artificially
raising
the
rate
to
his
wholesaler
in
order
to
squeeze
wholesaler
out
of
business
retail
business
that
would
be
a
violation
to
antitrust
clause.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
that’s
a
very
interesting
question.
and
my
suggestion
is
that
probably
parker
against
brown
would
not
govern.
parker
against
brown,
of
course,
you
--
this
court
knows
and
is
currently
considering
the
detroit
edison
case
which
will
address
the
question
of
just
exactly
what
the
impact
of
a
state-ordered
rate
would
be.
but
my
analysis
would
be
that
this
case
falls
between
--
somewhere
between
the
act
of
sovereignty
which
is
immune
from
the
antitrust
laws
under
parker
v.
brown.
and
the
state
allowed
anticompetitive
conduct
which
was
held
not
to
be
a
defense
of
the
antitrust
laws
under
the
goldfarb
case
because
there’s
no
indication
that
there
is
any
state
policy
here
favoring
an
anticompetitive
--
an
artificially
low
and
anticompetitive
rate.
and
i
think
proof
of
that
would
be
that
the
arkansas
power
has
in
fact
filed
rate
increases
since
the
beginning
of
these
proceedings
in
arkansas.
and
they
have
been
processed
and
they
have
been
granted.
so,
my
judgment
would
be
that
there
is
no
state
policy
here
requiring
this
rate.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
well
that
--
if
the
state
looks
at
the
rate,
you
see,
the
way
arkansas
works
is
more
or
less
likely
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
well,
they
do
in
this
sense.
that
arkansas
is
like
the
federal
government.
in
that
one
files
a
rate
and
it
can
become
effective
under
suspension
with
a
posting
of
a
bond
before
a
ruling
is
made
upon
its
justice
and
reasonableness.
if
it
turns
out
that
after
a
complete
analysis
of
the
state
rate
filing,
the
state
determines
that
this
is
indeed
a
compensatory
rate
and
one
that
they
wish
to
impose
and
there
remains
a
price
squeeze,
where
the
federal
side
has
been
through
its
process
and
determined
that
the
wholesale
rate
is
just
and
reasonable
under
federal
standards.
and
the
process
has
been
completed
on
the
state
side
and
there
is
a
state
finding
of
justice
and
reasonableness
on
the
state
side.
and
they’re
nonetheless
remains
a
differential.
that’s
simply
a
fact
of
life.
i
don’t
--
if
it’s
by
hypothesis,
there’s
no
violation
of
law.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i
would
agree
but
only
if
the
process
has
gone
through
the
point
of
the
state
determining
that
this
is
indeed
the
rate
that
they
think
ought
to
be
applied.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
if
the
allegation
were
that
it
would
simply
went
into
effect
without
an
investigation,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
under
the
antitrust
laws,
that
doctrine
in
parker
v.
brown
would
not
create
an
immunity
and
one
could
perhaps
achieve
a
remedy
in
federal
court.
of
course
not
all
problems
have
remedies
and
not
all
problems
with
respect
to
this
situation
necessarily
have
remedies
in
the
federal
system.
we
have
a
responsibility
to
assure
that
the
wholesale
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
and
the
remedy
for
this
discrimination
if
--
and
the
only
thing
it
could
be
in
my
judgment
is
an
artificially
depressed
retail
rate
lies
with
the
state.
that’s
allowing
that
circumstance
to
obtain.
and
if
the
state
doesn’t
do
it,
it’s
because
they’re
not
doing
their
job,
not
because
we’re
not
doing
ours.
we
think
that
beyond
the
jurisdictional
limitations
that
i've
mentioned
that
the
remedy
suggested
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
addressed
to
the
wrong
rate
and
in
any
event
is
an
inadequate
remedy.
we’ve
already
discussed
in
my
discussions
with
justice
stevens
the
fact
that
a
squeeze
might
arise
in
three
ways,
either
from
an
inflated
wholesale
rate
or
depressed
retail
rate
or
something
that
was
an
end-product
of
analysis
of
both
rates.
and
i
have
assumed
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
that
the
discrimination
alleged
here
is
caused
or
alleged
to
be
caused
by
an
artificially
depressed
retail
rate.
i
make
that
assumption
because
as
i’ve
indicated,
our
ordinary
standards
of
rate
making
would
require
us
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
that
the
wholesale
costs
are
not
artificially
inflated.
and
thus
that
knows
price
squeeze
caused
by
artificially
inflated
wholesale
rates
could
ever
arise.
so,
the
price
squeeze
if
it
exist
at
all,
exist
by
a
virtue
of
an
artificially
depressed
retail
rate;
it’s
our
view
that
that
of
course
is
a
rate
of
which
we
have
no
jurisdiction.
that’s
my
first
point
that
i
wish
to
make
with
the
court.
but
in
any
event,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
ordinary
federal
standards
of
rate
making
would
forbid
us
to
remedy
this
discrimination
by
lowering
the
wholesale
rate
which
is
what
the
remedy
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
and
the
remedy
that
conway
had
suggested.
because
the
wholesale
rate
has
to
recover
allocated
wholesale
costs
and
the
relief
that
conway
suggests
the
reduction
of
the
wholesale
rate
is
not
related
to
wholesale
costs
but
it’s
related
to
retail
rates.
this
court
in
the
shreveport
case,
in
discussing
circumstances
where
the
court
found
the
power
to
address
the
discrimination
between
the
jurisdictional
and
a
non-jurisdictional
rate
held
that
that
situation
cannot
be
remedied
by
sacrificing
federal
standards
of
ratemaking.
and
the
court
said
and
this
is
at
234
u.s.
355.
“it
is
clear
that
in
removing
the
injurious
discrimination
against
interstate
traffic
arising
from
the
relationship
of
the
intrastate
to
the
interstate
rate,
congress
is
not
bound
to
reduce
the
latter
below
what
it
may
deem
to
be
the
proper
standard.
thus
our
obligations
are
to
assure
a
just
and
reasonable
jurisdictional
rate.
and
we’re
not
in
the
position
and
we’re
not
allowed
under
our
ratemaking
responsibilities
to
sacrifice
that
rate
in
order
to
remedy
a
discrimination
caused
by
an
anticompetitive
non-jurisdictional
rate.”
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
this
whole
problem
could
--
of
not
being
able
to
lower
the
wholesale
rate
might
be
avoided
by
reference
to
its
concept
of
a
zone
of
reasonable
wholesale
rates
and
suggested
that
we
might
reduce
the
wholesale
rate
to
the
lower
range
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness.
and
therefore,
have
some
effect
on
the
price
squeeze
situation.
we
don’t
think
that
the
--
that
there
is
an
adequate
zone
or
a
zone
in
a
wholesale
ratemaking
which
allows
us
to
effectuate
this
kind
of
remedy.
in
setting
rates,
the
commission
is
required
to
set
a
rate
which
will
assure
adequate
and
reliable
electric
power
at
that
least
cost
while
maintaining
the
financial
integrity
of
the
utility.
in
setting
that
rate,
the
commission
does
not
locate
a
zone
of
reasonable
rates
and
then
select
a
rate
within
the
zone.
rather,
it
attempts
to
find
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
it
evaluates
items
of
cause
such
as
plant
investment,
fuel
cost,
labor
and
management
expenses,
capital
cost,
depreciation
and
taxes.
these
are
knowable,
measurable
figures.
they
can
and
should
be
precisely
quantified.
and
their
evaluation
does
not
create
a
zone
of
reasonableness.
the
only
zone
of
reasonableness
that
might
be
found
in
utility
ratemaking
is
the
range
of
potentially
appropriate
rates
of
return
on
that
investment
rate
base,
specifically,
rate
of
return
on
common
equity.
but
we
don’t
think
that
here
is
an
appropriate
place
to
make
an
adjustment
because
of
allegations
of
anticompetitive
conduct.
the
commission
must
select
a
rate
of
return
which
is
commensurate
with
the
risk
associated
with
investment
which
will
maintain
the
existing
investment
which
will
attract
new
investment
at
a
reasonable
cost.
and
we
think
that
it
doesn’t
make
sense
to
select
that
rate
on
any
other
grounds
than
those
criteria
stated
because
of
allegations
of
anticompetitive
conduct.
but
our
fundamental
contention
is
that
justice
jackson
was
right
when
he
said
in
the
colorado
interstate
case,
“the
act
forbids
discrimination
only
as
between
regulated
rates
and
does
not
forbid
discrimination
between
the
regulated
and
unregulated
ones.”
and
we
don’t
think
that
this
conclusion
creates
a
regulatory
gap
requiring
the
court
to
expand
on
the
plain
words
of
section
205.
i’ve
already
addressed
the
possibilities
of
remedy.
but
i
also
think
it’s
worth
noting
that
price
squeeze
in
an
unlikely
event
in
the
nature
of
things.
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
commission’s
ordinary
rate
making
standards
with
respect
to
wholesale
rates
assure
that
there
would
be
no
artificially
inflated
wholesale
rates.
so
that
no
price
squeeze
caused
by
such
rates
could
arise.
moreover,
in
an
industry
where
80
to
90%
of
the
business
comes
from
retail
revenues,
it
seems
unlikely
that
a
truly
anticompetitive
rate
would
be
created
or
maintained
on
the
retail
side.
of
course
if
it
does,
if
this
does
happen,
there
is
another
remedy
mr.
justice
stevens
i
didn’t
mentioned,
congress
can
expand
upon
the
powers
of
the
commission.
and
in
fact
there
are
currently
pending
four
separate
bills
addressed
to
congress’
responsibility
with
respect
to
unfair
methods
of
competition.
alternatively,
of
course
as
i’ve
suggested,
there
may
be
remedies
before
the
state
commission
or
remedies
under
the
antitrust
clause.
accordingly,
i
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
it
is
always
been
our
custom
to
allow
the
solicitor
in
the
justice
department
to
determine
whether
petitions
would
be
filed
with
this
court.
our
statute
allows
us
to
represent
ourselves
in
any
case
in
court.
it
makes
no
specific
reference
to
the
supreme
court.
now,
what
happened
here
of
course
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i'm
saying
that
we
have
always
construed
our
statute
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
in
essence,
i'm
saying
yes
he
is
the
authorized
representative.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i
think
i
have
to
say
what
happened
in
order
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i
can
say
that
of
course
he
has
expressed
no
dissent
to
the
views
expressed
in
this
brief.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
my
answer
is
that
i
don’t
know.
i
know
that
he
knows
--
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
you
have
his
authorized
filing.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i
think
that
these
are
the
views
of
the
united
states
as
authorized
to
be
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general.
that’s
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
it
does.
but
a
problem
can
arise.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
the
evidence
is
that
the
antitrust
division
has
not
dissented
and
has
made
no
filling
of
its
own.
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
supplemental
memorandum?
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
i’m
not
sure
what
document
you’re
talking
about.
what
case
do
we
have?
mr.
allan
abbot
tuttle
there’s
no
filing
in
this
case
by
the
solicitor
general
that
i
know
of.
