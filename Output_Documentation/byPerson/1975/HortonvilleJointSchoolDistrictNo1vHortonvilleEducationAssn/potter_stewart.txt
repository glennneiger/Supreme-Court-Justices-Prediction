justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
an
added
(ph)
union
motive
on
behalf
of
the
hortonville
joint
school
district,
is
no
part
of
what
needed
to
be
proved,
it
was
no
part
of
their
decision.
it
was
simply
their
decision
is,
you
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
was
that
the
hortonville
board
was
constitutionally
incapable
in
their
view
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
assessing
these
terminations
--
of
effecting
these
terminations?
justice
potter
stewart
had
negotiated
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
per
se
constitutionally
incapable
of
terminating
these
employments,
is
that
not
right?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
be
a
statement
or
back
pay
or,
and
maybe
other
things?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
not
statement
factually
correct,
or
factually
and
legally
correct
that
one
of
their
options
was
to
discharge
the
striking
teachers?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
seek
discharge
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
an
employer
and
an
employee
situation.
now
an
employer
does
not
seek
discharge
of
his
employee,
he
discharges
them,
does
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
it
was
common
ground
in
this
case
that
an
alternative
response
to
use
the
chief
justice's
of
the
hortonville
school
board
to
this
strike
was
the
discharge
of
the
striking
teachers?
justice
potter
stewart
both
under
the
wisconsin
law
as
it
is
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
an
alternative.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
was
common
ground,
am
i
wrong
about
that,
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
another
alternative.
my
question
is,
is
that
a
legally
valid
alternative
under
wisconsin
law
as
interpreted
in
this
and
perhaps
other
cases
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it
is
not
then
i
misunderstand
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
everything
must
comply
with
due
process,
that
is
as
long
as
we
have
a
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
or
no
because
if
it
is
no
then
i
misunderstand
the
--
misapprehend
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
i
do
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
that
extent
i
understand
with
this
case.
