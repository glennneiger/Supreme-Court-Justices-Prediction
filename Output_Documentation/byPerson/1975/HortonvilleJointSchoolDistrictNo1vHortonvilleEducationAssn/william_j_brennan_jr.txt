looking
at
page
a-24
which
is
the
opinion
of
your
supreme
court,
would
you
tell
me
whether
on
the
issue
before
us,
namely
whether
or
not
the
school
board
was
an
impartial
decision
maker?
your
supreme
court
held
it
was
not
for
any
reasons
except
those
stated
in
the
paragraph
at
a-24
beginning
the
back
ground
giving
rights,
anywhere
else
in
the
opinion
which
isolate
the
reasons
for
that
conclusion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
am
looking
at
the
petition
for
cert,
page
a-24.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
a
long
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
only
place
i
find
in
it
in
the
statement
of
reasons
supporting
the
conclusion
that
the
school
board
was
an
impartial
decision,
was
a
partial
decision
maker.
it
is
in
that
paragraph
starting
at
the
background
giving
rights
and
the
only
reasons
i
find
there
are
first,
that
the
board
was
a
collective
bargaining
agent
and
as
such
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
the
frustration
on
the
part
of
the
board
members
and
negotiations
broke
down
which
is
not
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
dedicated
public
service,
but
they
were
not
uninvolved
in
the
events
which
were
precipitated
decisions
they
would
required
to
make.
decision
to
discharge
was
possibly
convenient
alternative
and
that
is
all
that
appears
as
the
basis
upon
which
as
i
read
it,
they
finally
concluded
that
the
board
was
not
an
impartial
decision
make
in
the
constitutional
sense?

collective
bargaining
agent,
and
frustrated
because
they
could
not
--
when
negotiations
broke
down,
and
therefore,
they
were
mad
at
the
teachers
and
therefore
they
are
not
an
impartial
decision
makers,
any
thing
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.

(inaudible)
constitutionally
adds
up
to
a
partial
decision
maker,
so
it
not,
a
biased
decision
maker?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
here
is
whether
the
elected
members
of
the
public
school
board
who
have
the
exclusive
authority
under
the
state
law
to
discharge
teachers
engaged
in
illegal
strike
are
prohibited
by
the
due
process
clause
from
doing
so
because
they
are
not
sufficiently
impartial
decision
makers,
that
is
the
only
issue
before
us?
