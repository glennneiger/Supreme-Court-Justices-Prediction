mr.
jack
d.
walker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
application
of
procedural
due
process
to
a
decision
of
an
elected
local
school
board,
to
terminate
and
replace
teachers
who
are
striking
unlawfully
at
the
time
of
and
after
their
discharge
and
replacement,
and
who
in
addition
were
given
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
reemployment,
but
did
not
do
so.
a
divided
wisconsin
supreme
court,
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
withrow
versus
larkin,
held
that
whenever
a
school
board
has
had
prior
involvement
or
stated
in
other
way,
whenever
a
school
board
has
an
interest
which
is
adverse
to
an
employee
interest,
a
court
or
other
agency
not
responsible
for
school
district
policy,
must
determine
not
only
whether
the
school
board’s
discharge
decision
was
substantially
lawful
and
not
arbitrary,
but
also
whether
another
course
of
action
would
have
been
more
reasonable.
in
this
case,
the
school
board
under
wisconsin
law
have
the
exclusive
duty
to
bargain
with
the
labor
union
which
represented
its
teaching
employees,
and
in
addition
had
the
exclusive
duty
under
state
law
to
employ
and
dismiss
teachers.
the
wisconsin
court
found
these
functions
constitutionally
incompatible.
facts
are
that
in
march
of
1974,
the
school
board
and
the
union
were
bargaining
the
for
renewal
of
their
collective
bargaining
agreement.
on
march
18,
the
teachers
went
on
strike.
at
that
time
they
were
then
teaching
under
one-year
individual
contracts
of
employment,
pursuant
to
wisconsin
law.
the
strike
closed
the
public
school.
during
the
strike,
the
district
sent
each
teacher
two
letters
inviting
them
to
return
to
work
and
in
the
second
warning
that
the
school
board
would
not
condone
the
strike.
a
few
teachers
offered
to
return
to
work
in
response
to
the
first
letter,
but
none
offered
to
return
in
response
to
the
second
letter.
when
there
was
no
response
to
the
second
invitation
to
return,
the
school
board
decided
to
consider
whether
to
terminate
and
replace
the
teachers.
pursuant
to
the
apparent
requirements
of
board
of
regents
versus
roth,
the
teachers
were
given
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
respecting
the
action
under
consideration.
at
the
hearing,
which
was
scheduled
pursuant
to
those
notices
before
the
school
board,
the
teachers
appeared
as
a
group
represented
by
a
counsel
and
took
the
position
that
they
would
not
speak
individually
and
would
not
answer
questions.
counsel
on
their
behalf
took
the
following
positions.
first
that
the
school
board
could
infer
they
were
in
fact
on
strike.
second,
that
because
the
school
board
was
involved
in
the
bargaining
over
which
they
were
striking,
the
school
board
could
not
act
in
the
matter
and
could
not
infer
that
the
strike
was
a
breach
of
contract
or
unlawful.
and
third,
counsel
for
the
teachers
asserted
that
the
school
board
had
in
the
past
not
bargained
in
good
faith
as
required
by
wisconsin
law.
the
counsel
for
the
school
board
reminded
counsel
for
the
teachers
at
that
point
that
the
correct
forum
under
wisconsin
law
for
any
allegation
of
an
employer-prohibited
practice
was
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission
and
informed
counsel
for
the
teachers
that
in
his
view,
whether
or
not
the
school
board
was
alleged
to
have
refused
to
bargain,
was
immaterial
to
the
question
of
a
strike,
because
under
wisconsin
law
there
is
no
concept
of
a
prohibited
practice
or
justified
strike
and
because
in
any
event
jurisdiction
of
those
matters
lay
with
the
werc.
the
werc
is
an
agency
similar
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
may
decide
and
may
annul
any
discharge
which
it’s
found
--
it
finds
to
have
been
based
in
whole
or
in
any
part
in
an
anti-union
motivation.
the
counsel
for
the
teachers
in
effect
agreed
that
any
remedy
of
an
alleged
prohibited
practice
would
not
terminate
the
strike,
and
that
the
teachers
would
return
to
work
when
a
contract
acceptable
to
them
had
been
agreed
upon.
he
did
this
by
stating
that
it
would
do
him
no
good
to
go
before
the
werc
with
an
allegation
of
a
prohibited
practice.
the
teachers
have
in
fact
never
filed
any
prohibited
practice
complaint
against
the
school
board
over
any
aspects
of
these
matters,
or
never
filed
any
such
complaint
at
all,
ever.
positions
which
were
not
taken
by
the
teachers
at
the
hearing
were
--
there
was
no
attempt
to
prove
or
proof
that
there
was
any
personal
bias
toward
any
individual
teacher
by
any
member
of
the
school
board.
their
position
was
an
institutional
incompatibility.
second,
there
was
no
offer
to
return
to
work
made
by
the
teachers
at
that
hearing
or
any
indication
of
an
offer
other
than
that
in
effect,
the
strike
would
continue
until
agreement
satisfactory
to
teachers
was
reached.
after
the
hearings,
the
school
board
met
and
voted
to
terminate
and
replace
the
teachers.
as
a
part
of
the
same
decisions,
the
school
board
determined
to
invite
each
teacher
to
apply
for
reemployment,
and
each
notice,
a
written
notice
of
termination
to
each
teacher
in
fact
did
contain
what
the
wisconsin
court
described
as
a
notice
of
a
right
to
apply
for
reinstatement.
only
one
teacher
did
so
apply
and
he
was
returned
to
his
former
position.
on
april
8,
1974,
the
schools
reopened
with
contractive
replacements.
this
action
was
begun
alleging
a
denial
of
due
process
and
in
connection
with
beginning
the
action,
the
teachers
asked
a
wisconsin
circuit
court
to
enjoin
the
school
board
from
hiring
permanent
replacements,
but
did
not
in
connection
with
that
motion
make
an
offer
to
return
to
work.
after
an
evidentiary
hearing,
the
wisconsin
court
denied
the
injunction
against
hiring
replacements,
and
he
noted
in
his
opinion
doing
so
that
the
teachers
were
still
on
strike
and
consequently
depriving
themselves
of
employment
on
april
11,
1974,
some
nine
days
after
the
terminations
and
four
days
after
the
school
opened
with
contracted
replacements.
with
respect
to
the
underlying
complaint,
the
school
board
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
in
connection
of
that
motion
each
party
had
the
opportunity
to
and
did
make
a
record
to
show
facts,
which
they
thought
were
material
and
in
dispute.
the
significance
here
is
that
the
teachers
again
made
no
claim
of
or
facts
to
show
any
personal
bias
on
the
part
of
any
member
of
the
school
board
toward
any
individual
teacher.
again,
the
focus
was
an
institutional
incompatibility,
and
again,
with
respect
to
this
motion
in
june
of
1974,
the
teachers
made
no
effort
to
claim
that
there
had
been
any
offer
to
return
to
work.
the
later
point
is
significant
because
in
briefs
before
this
court,
respondent’s
now
claim
that
they
could
prove
that
there
was
an
offer
made
in
april
of
’74,
however,
the
incident
referred
to
was
not
an
unconditional
offer
and
was
conditional
and
was
in
fact
made
on
april
25,
some
eighteen
days
after
the
school
board
had
contracted
and
begun
operating
with
contracted
replacements.
the
circuit
court
granted
the
board’s
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
teachers'
appeal.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
held
that
under
state
law,
a
school
board
could
discharge
these
teachers
who
engaged
in
the
prohibited
strike,
and
the
court
rejected
the
claim
that
prohibiting
this
strike
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
however,
the
wisconsin
court
held
that
the
teachers
have
been
denied
procedural
due
process.
in
wisconsin
court’s
view,
under
morrissey
versus
brewer,
even
in
a
case
of
a
stipulated
or
undisputed
facts,
an
involved
decision
maker
had
to
decide
what
to
do
on
the
basis
of
those
facts.
the
wisconsin
court
also
did
not
make
any
finding
of
a
personal
bias.
rather
it
said
that
it
was
not
suggesting
that
school
board
members
were
anything
other
than
dedicated
public
servants
striving
to
preside
--
provide
their
district
with
quality
education
within
their
limited
budget.
the
wisconsin
court
made
it
clear
that
that
defect
it
saw
was
an
institutional
perspective.
it
did
so
by
analyzing
the
methods
of
review
available
to
the
teachers.
it
noted
that
under
common
law
certiorari
or
by
complaint
to
the
employment
relations
commission,
any
substantive
violation
of
law
was
curable,
and
review
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
decision
was
arbitrary.
but
the
court
said
neither
of
these
methods
could
replace
an
impartial
decision
maker
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
the
other
method,
justice
rehnquist,
described
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
by
complaint
to
the
employment
relations
commission,
and
in
its
discussion
of
that
relief
the
court
noted
specifically
that
the
employment
relations
commission
would
overturn
any
discharge
which
was
based
on
an
anti-union
motive,
even
if
there
was
also
a
good
reason
for
discharge.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
they
could
have
done
so
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
did
not
directly
allude
to
that,
although
we
had
mentioned
it.
they
would
have
had
two
methods
of
suing
for
breach
of
contract,
at
least
two.
one
under
wisconsin
law,
the
employment
relations
commission
cannot
only
hear
normal
prohibited
practices,
but
may
also
entertain
suits
for
breach
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
the
teachers
could
probably
could
have
sued
in
court
on
that
or
in
court
on
the
individual
contracts,
and
did
not
do
any
of
those
things.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
no,
not
breach
of
contract
or
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
it
would
be
de
novo
and
would
not
review
a
record
with
respect
to
the
issues
involved.
the
court
said
that
neither
--
none
of
the
available
avenues
of
review
would
be
satisfactory
constitutionally
because
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
none
whatsoever,
the
juri
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
completely
de
novo
before
the
employment
relations
commission
exactly
as
it
is
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
it
is
exactly
the
same
theory.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
just
exactly
and
particularly,
under
wisconsin
law,
as
i
have
said
even
if
there
is
a
good
reason
for
discharge,
if
any
one
of
the
motives
is
an
anti-union
motive,
the
employment
relations
commission
can
void
the
discharge.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
yes.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
if
that
is
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
under
the
wisconsin
decision,
the
anti-union
motive
was
irrelevant
really,
although
because
of
the
available
review
under
werc,
although
the
respondents
wish
in
effect
to
realign
the
jurisdiction
of
the
question
of
the
anti-union
motive
and
take
it
away
from
the
employment
relations
commission.
but
in
this
case
under
the
wisconsin
decision,
the
issue
as
i
am
about
to
get
to
is
whether
another
course
of
action
substantively
lawful,
such
as
the
wisconsin
court
listed
offering
to
go
to
binding
arbitration
over
the
entire
contract
matter,
or
attempting
to
seek
an
injunction
or
doing
nothing,
just
continuing
to
bargain
during
the
strike.
this
proceeding
is
to
decide
whether
one
of
those
courses
of
action
would
have
been
more
reasonable,
although
under
state
law
the
wisconsin
court
--
under
state
law
the
wisconsin
court
made
it
clear
that
those
choices
were
discretionary
with
the
school
board.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
yes,
because
the
school
board
as
an
elective
body
had
interest
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
had
negotiated
and
had
an
interest
in
how
to
reopen
the
school.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
that
is
what
was
held.
the
court
itself
recognized
that
this
disposition
was
not
ideal
because
in
fact
the
court
would
or
might
have
to
make
policy
decisions
better
left
to
an
agency.
in
wisconsin,
and
i
think
elsewhere,
school
districts
have
historically
and
traditionally
have
been
directed
by
lay
school
boards,
elected
by
and
directly
responsible
to
taxpayers,
parents
and
the
general
public
and
responsible
for
all
phases
of
education,
financing
curriculum,
the
employment
of
teachers.
this
grouping
of
policy-making
functions
has
always
been
expected
not
only
by
parents
and
taxpayers,
but
also
by
teachers
in
their
employment
relationships.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
in
future
cases?
yes,
i
do
believe
this
decision
can
very
well
go
beyond
the
strike
situation.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
in
fairness
to
decision
itself,
i
do
not
think
that
that
situation
was
contemplated,
but
i
think
it
can
occur.
i
think
it
can
occur
whenever
for
example
the
mere
allegation
that
the
discharge
is
for
sex
discrimination
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
no.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
cause
for
the
discharge
is
not
challenged
and
that
was
not
considered
to
be
a
factor
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
although
it
is
by
respondents.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
yes,
and
it
would
present
a
complex
factual
question
whereas
this
really
presents
a
policy
question
and
was
decided
on
that
basis
as
we
believe
it.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
that
is
a
part
of
the
analysis,
yes.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
that
is
right
and
it
is
also
the
same
school
board
which
decided
that
it
is
not
good
policy
to
have
intoxi
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
well,
there
is
a
slight
difference
which
i
think
makes
our
case
the
stronger
that
the
interest
of
the
school
board
in
the
bargaining
is
not
a
personal
interest.
actually,
it
is
institutional
and
it
is
not
teacher
versus
school
board,
it
is
representative
of
teacher
versus
school
district
as
an
entity.
there
is
further
insulation
that
is
not
even
present
in
the
intoxication
case.
the
interests
of
employers
and
employees
as
has
been
noted
are
often
adverse
and
as
quote
with
the
wisconsin
decision
can
extend
beyond
strikes.
employers
frequently
must
make
discharge
decisions,
and
they
are
willing
to
do
so
when
their
decisions
are
subject
to
review
and
the
standards
of
review
are
known.
but
in
this
case
where
the
matter
to
be
reviewed
is
not
whether
the
discharge
was
substantively
lawful
and
not
arbitrary,
but
whether
the
employer’s
policy
should
be
reexamined
or
its
prior
involvement
was
incorrect.
employers
will
be
made
timid
if
not
all
together
none-functioning
and
unwilling
to
make
the
sorts
of
policy
decisions
and
implementations
which
they
were
elected
to
make.
as
against
this
policy
considerations,
the
respondents'
interest
here
and
a
different
decision
maker
is
minimum.
the
fact
of
striking
has
been
admitted
and
it
is
admitted
and
settled,
with
striking
is
a
cause
for
discharge.
at
the
time
of
the
discharge,
these
teachers
were
in
fact
not
in
possession
of
the
property
they
now
claim
because
they
were
on
strike
and
did
not
have
income.
in
addition,
each
of
the
teachers
was
invited
to
return
to
work
not
only
before,
but
also
after
his
discharge.
the
employees
could
have
retained
their
property
they
now
claim
by
the
unilateral
act
of
returning
to
work.
due
process
does
not
require
more.
the
respondents
appear
to
acknowledge
in
their
briefs
before
this
court
that
the
mere
location
of
bargaining
and
discharge
functions
is
not
unconstitutional.
instead,
the
respondents
now
seek
to
recast
the
opinion
of
the
wisconsin’s
supreme
court
to
create
the
illusion
that
a
personal
bias
was
involved.
they
assert
that
merely
by
accusing
the
school
board
of
bargaining
in
bad
faith,
they
have
shown
that
each
member
of
the
school
board
was
personally
biased
against
each
individual
teacher.
this
claim
should
be
rejected.
first,
because
there
is
no
concept
of
a
justified
or
prohibited
practice
strike
under
wisconsin
law.
second,
because
in
any
event
the
state
has
allocated
the
function
of
determining
prohibited
practices
both
hearing
and
remedying
them
to
an
employment
relations
commission
and
the
teachers
consistently
and
beginning
at
the
hearing
before
the
school
board,
renounced
their
right
to
pursue
that
remedy.
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
lake
michigan
college
case,
has
concluded
that
in
this
circumstances
that
this
allocation
of
functions
by
state
governments
is
constitutional
and
that
there
is
no
disqualification
of
a
school
board
for
making
these
sorts
of
decisions.
the
wisconsin
law
contemplates
just
what
the
federal
labor
law
contemplates
in
private
employment.
the
jurisdiction
over
not
only
what
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
what
effect
does
an
unfair
labor
practice
have
on
a
strike
as
with
a
specialized
agency,
and
it
is
not
up
to
the
determination
merely
by
allegation
of
the
striking
employees.
any
claim
of
sex
discrimination
or
any
claim
that
the
discharge
has
been
based
on
an
anti-union
motivation
would
disqualify
an
employer
if
the
respondents'
claim
in
this
case
is
acknowledged.
recently,
wisconsin
circuit
court
in
fact
has
applied
the
hortonville
decision,
in
a
matter
which
is
unfortunately
not
reported
anywhere,
to
a
sex
discrimination
case,
holding
that
merely
because
a
female
employee
has
filed
a
sex
discrimination
charge
with
a
state
agency,
that
the
university
of
wisconsin
board
of
regions
was
thereafter
disqualified
from
considering
her
termination
of
employment
and
instead
a
wisconsin
circuit
court
would
have
to
consider
her
termination
of
employment.
we
think
in
effect
that
since
the
teachers
here
have
ignored
both
their
opportunities
to
return
to
work
before
and
after
their
discharge
and
replacement,
and
have
ignored
their
substantive
right
to
pursue
claims
of
wrongdoing
before
state
agency
having
jurisdiction
to
remedy
them
and
have
instead
pursued
only
their
view
of
a
policy
neutral
or
policy
neuter,
decision
maker
as
an
end
in
itself
and
not
as
a
means
against
the
protection
of
an
arbitrary
taking
of
property
or
substance
of
error.
we
believe
that
they
have
done
this
in
order
to
obtain
not
merely
the
substantive
right
to
strike,
but
the
substantive
right
to
strike
without
being
replaced.
we
believe
that
procedural
due
process
does
not
contemplate
the
change
in
substantives
rights
of
this
magnitude.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
oh!
certainly,
yes,
it
has.
its
jurisdiction
is
exactly
the
same
as,
if
not
more
extensive
than
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
and
maybe
many
other
things.
there
is
a
recent
case
in
fact,
pardon
me
i
do
not
have
it,
it
is
not
cited
in
the
brief
and
it
is
unfortunately
not
in
this
list,
yes
it
is.
the
employment
relations
commission
against
the
city
of
evansville,
is
in
even
more
recent
description
of
employment
relations
commission
of
powers
and
it
is
69
wisconsin
2nd
140.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
there
are
several
avenues.
the
one
noted
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
by
petition
for
common
law
writ
of
certiorari,
which
--
in
which
the
court
would
decide
whether
the
decision
was
reasonable,
represented
the
employer’s
judgment
and
not
its
will,
and
make
sure
it
was
not
arbitrary.
you
could
in
addition,
sue
for
breach
of
contract,
either
the
individual
written
contract
or
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
of
the
suing
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
you
can
sue
before
the
employment
relations
commission
as
well,
and
the
standard
is
just
cause.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
i
think
obviously
it
does
not
necessarily
to
go
that
far
because
there
was
a
hearing
and
we
do
not
believe
there
is
even
a
claim
of
personal
bias,
but
certainly
there
is
de
novo
determination
of
the
only
justification
that
the
union
has
made
or
that
the
teachers
have
made
and
had
his
reviewable
de
novo.
and
regardless
of
that
in
circumstances
where
the
public
school
is
closed
we
do
believe
that
it
would
have
been
possible
to
terminate
and
replace
without
a
hearing
in
this
case,
but
in
any
event
a
record
hearing
was
held.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
i
do
not
know
how
many
in
the
system,
the
number
involved
in
the
strike
are
i
believe
eighty-six
or
eighty-eight
teachers.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
i
do
not
--
that,
that
is
the
number
involved
in
this
litigation.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
i
would
like
to
pick-up
immediately
on
the
inquiry
of
mr.
justice
white.
if
the
school
board’s
position
before
this
court
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
de
novo
review
all
over
the
place,
then
it
should
be
no
concern
of
this
court
how
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
gives
us
our
de
novo
review.
if
on
the
other
hand,
they
concede
that
this
de
novo
review
given
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
different
than
the
review
that
we
would
get
before
the
werc
or
certiorari
breach
of
contract,
then
we
have
the
due
process
question
which
we
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
no,
it
was
not
tried,
and
it
is
not
required
to
be
tried
under
wisconsin
law.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said
none
of
these
remedies
are
exclusive.
the
statutes
says
that,
111.07
says
that
going
to
werc
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy.
there
are
no
exclusive
remedies.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
did
say
however
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
that
is
correct.
they
are
not
adequate,
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
think
is
significant.
we
do
have
de
novo
review
all
over
the
place
on
various
aspects,
but
not
the
kind
of
de
novo
review
that
we
seek
in
this
case
and
the
reason
is
that
the
issue
is
not
merely
whether
a
strike
has
been
committed
by
the
teachers.
under
wisconsin
law,
unlike
the
federal
law,
where
congress
said
the
penalty
for
striking
is
discharge,
the
legislature
of
wisconsin
gave
no
penalty.
they
just
said
striking
is
prohibited,
a
word
taken
out
of
the
labor
context
as
a
prohibited
practice
like
any
other
prohibited
practice
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
he
sure
does
not,
and
that
is
--
mr.
jack
d.
walker
he
is
not
required
to
and
neither
is
the
school
board.
so,
the
issue
is
under
wisconsin
law
and
it
is
a
wisconsin
state
ground
that
the
penalty
must
be
reasonable,
taking
into
account
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
that
is
precisely
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said.
in
taking
into
account,
the
determination
of
reasonable
penalty
is
not
as
counsel
has
stated,
that
a
court
is
going
to
decide
an
order
of
school
board
to
engage
in
arbitration
or
engage
in
mediation
or
to
go
into
further
bargaining,
that
is
not
the
point.
mr.
jack
d.
walker
just
one
factual
matter
mr.
chief
justice
at
appendix
page
45
which
is
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
there
is
what
we
think
is
a
no-strike
clause.
it
says
there
shall
be
no
suspension
of
work
or
interference
with
the
operations
during
the
term
of
this
agreement
and
that
document
is
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
each
individual
contract,
a
sample
of
which
appears
that
at
appendix
page
60.
