we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
74-1606,
hortonville
joint
school
district.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
opinion
as
prohibiting
the
school
board
from
making
individualized
determinations
for
dismiss
of
teacher,
particular
teacher,
for
cause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
when
it
was
intoxicated
in
the
courtroom,
the
school
board
could
refer
charges,
but
they
would
have
to
refer
it
under
this
opinion
to
someone
else
to
decide
the
factual
and
other
issues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
are
they
less
or
in
any
way
differently
postured
to
make
an
impartial
decision
here
than
in
the
intoxication
case,
having
in
mind
that
there
is
no
dispute
now
that
the
teachers
were
on
strike,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
so
that
the
cause
for
the
discharge
is
not
challenged?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fact
of
the
matter,
it
could
be
argued
at
least
that
there
is
more
reason
to
have
a
different
and
disinterested
impartial
trier
for
the
intoxicated
teacher
than
in
this
case
because
the
teacher
might
conceivably
deny
the
intoxication
and
want
a
hearing
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
the
same
school
board
that
participated
in
the
negotiation
to
hire
the
intoxicated
teacher?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
fundamental
difference
between
negotiating
with
twenty-nine
schoolteachers
at
once
and
negotiating
with
one
teacher
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friebert.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
hortonville
joint
school
district
against
the
education
association.
mr.
friebert.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
penalty
phase
mr.
friebert,
is
there
not
a
breach
of
contract
here
among
other
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
they
were
on
strike
illegally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
describe
the
“right,”
not
to
go
on
strike?
is
that
a
contract
in
part
or
is
it
purely
statutory
and
not
part
of
the
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
strike
prohibited
by
law
in
wisconsin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
if
there
is
a
prohibition
by
the
law
of
the
legislature
of
wisconsin,
then
they
do
not
need
a
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
they
do
not
need
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
after,
i
must
misunderstood
you
and
misunderstood
this
record,
after
it
is
conceded
that
they
were
on
strike
and
that
the
strike
was
illegal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
a
choice
of
what
to
do
about
the
illegal
conduct
of
the
teachers,
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
choices
are
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mediate
what,
precisely
what,
(voice
overlap)
is
an
illegal
strike?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
precise
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
exactly
what
would
you
mediate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
response,
let
us
be
specific.
just
the
response
of
the
school
board,
is
that
not
correct,
whether
they
are
going
to
fire
the
teachers,
let
them
come
back,
we
will
work
out
a
compromise,
is
that
not
the
only
thing
that
has
got
to
be
decided,
a
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
use
a
neutral
term
response,
is
that
not
the
only
thing
that
there
is
to
be
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
interest
of
the
school
teacher
who
is
on
an
illegal
strike?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
freibert.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
determination
that
there
was
prejudgment
on
that
basis
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
friebert,
mr.
walker,
do
you
have
an
ending
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
four
opinions
to
announce
for
the
court.

74-1606
hortonville
joint
school
district

association.
for
reasons
stated
in
