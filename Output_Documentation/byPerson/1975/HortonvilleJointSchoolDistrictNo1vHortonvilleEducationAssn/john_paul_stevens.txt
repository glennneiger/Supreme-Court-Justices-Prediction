but
anti-union
motive
is
a
part
of
the
cause
of
action
there?
it
would
have
to
approve
an
anti-union
motive?
justice
john
paul

which
they
do
not
have
to
prove
if
they
are
right
in

justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
reasoning
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
the
board
would
not
be
disqualified
in
the
intoxication
case
because
it
is
not
a
participant
in
the
incident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
the
point
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
that
the
board
participated
in
the
negotiation,
and
therefore,
lost
its
impartiality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
penalty
is
not
appropriate
until
there
is
disobedience
of
a
court
order,
there
was
no
court
order
here,
was
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
this
was
not
a
penalty
issue
that
had
to
be
decided,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
point
of
your
reference
to
the
necessity
for
a
court
order,
i
do
not
understand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
friebert,
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
penalty
theory
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
--
you
say
of
course
that
there
should
be
an
impartial
decision
maker
who
should
decide
what
the
penalty
for
striking
should
be.
supposing
that
person
should
conclude
that
it
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
school
system
to
hire
permanent
teachers
and
that
that
could
not
be
done
without
first
discharging
the
strikers,
could
the
impartial
decision
maker
take
that
kind
of
consideration
into
account
in
making
his
decision
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
anyone
decide
to
strike
--
to
discharge
the
striking
teacher
just
because
that
he
thought
it
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
school
system?
i
take
it
the
interest
of
the
school
system
becomes
entirely
irrelevant
once
the
strike
commences?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
why
not?
who
represents
the
school
system
then
under
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can
take
into
account
if
i
just
understood
you,
anything
except
the
appropriate
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
differently
then
you
did
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
trying
to
give
you
a
fact
pattern
which
includes
a
non-penalty
type
consideration.
in
other
words,
the
sole
interest
here
would
be
on
the
school
system,
could
be
impartial
decision
maker
predicate
his
decision
in
part
on
something
that
is
unrelated
to
the
question
of
punishment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
there
would
be
no
one
who
would
represent
the
school
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
in
a
dilemma?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
are
correct
that
a
property
interest
is
destroyed,
you
would
have
a
state
law
remedy
for
breach
of
contract,
so
it
just
postponed,
the
remedy?
