mr.
robert
h.
friebert
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
left
off
yesterday,
i
think
there
might
have
been
some
misunderstanding
communication
in
answer
to
question
that
i
had
with
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
had
stated
that
under
federal
law
with
respect
to
municipal,
or
with
respect
to
federal
employees,
congress
has
declared
the
penalty
to
be
automatic
and
that
is
discharge
by
act
of
congress.
in
a
private
sector,
there
is
no
penalty
for
striking,
it
is
a
protected
activity
and
so
while
in
the
private
sector,
there
is
no
penalty
for
striking,
congress
has
declared
that
for
employees
of
a
federal
government,
there
is
an
automatic
penalty
of
discharge
and
it
is
a
crime.
this
is
not
the
case
in
wisconsin.
wisconsin
legislature
has
merely
stated
that
strikes
are
prohibited
and
provided
no
penalty,
except
for
those
situations
when
the
strikers
continue
on
strike
after
a
judicial
order,
ordering
them
back
to
work.
it
is
at
that
point
only
in
wisconsin
that
the
legislature
has
created
a
penalty.
in
fact,
under
wisconsin
law,
as
far
as
striking
teachers
are
concerned,
there
is
no
absolute
right
to
an
injunction.
the
court,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
interpreting
wisconsin
law,
has
clearly
indicated
recently
in
cases
cited
in
the
brief
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
this
case
decided
that
there
could
be
penalties
imposed
by
the
municipal
employer
in
addition
to
those
created
by
the
legislature,
but
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
am
stating
that
that
is
the
only
statement
made
by
the
wisconsin
legislature
on
the
subject.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said
in
this
case,
that
in
addition
to
those
penalties,
there
could
be
disciplinary
proceedings
conducted
by
the
employer,
but
that
discharge
is
not
an
automatic
penalty.
there
can
be
a
wide
variety
of
discipline
imposed
for
striking
which
is
a
completely
different
framework
than
that
created
by
congress
in
which
the
penalty
is
fixed.
therefore,
under
wisconsin
law,
there
is
discretion
and
judgment
which
must
be
used
in
the
penalty
phase
of
any
proceeding
involving
a
strike.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps,
only
perhaps
the
concurring
opinion
and
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
my
judgment
as
reading
the
whole
package
seems
to
be
saying
that
even
though
the
strike
might
be
prohibited,
there
can
be
a
mitigation
of
justification
and
the
whole
usual
kind
of
oral
mitigation
as
you
get
in
any
penalty
phase
of
the
proceedings,
which
takes
it
completely
different
as
to
whether
it
does
not
matter,
whether
they
were
unlawfully
on
strike.
that
does
not
mean
they
automatically
discharge
and
that
does
not
mean
they
automatically
breached
the
contract.
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
robert
hanson,
viewed
this
case
as
a
contract
case
and
his
opinion
was
that
there
would
be
no
automatic
recession.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
important
to
know
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
did
mr.
justice
white,
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
need
for
an
impartial
decision
maker?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
that
i
am
and
that
the
reason
there
was
a
need
for
an
impartial
decision
maker
is
because
the
issue
is
not
just
whether
there
was
a
strike
in
progress
or
whether
these
people
had
been
on
strike.
under
wisconsin
law,
these
people,
the
school
board
must
decide
what
a
penalty
should
be
and
whether
--
and
it
must
under
wisconsin
law
determine
a
reasonable
penalty,
therefore,
and
that
it
almost
is
a
classic
due
process
syllogism.
the
teachers
have
property
interest
and
it
is
a
dual
property
interest
in
this
case
because
they
have
two
contracts
in
effect.
they
have
a
contract
for
the
73-74
school
year
and
they
have
contracts,
property
rights
under
wisconsin
law,
for
the
74-75
school
year.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
not
part
of
the
contract.
in
fact,
the
board
was
trying
to
bargain
for
a
no-strike
clause
and
was
unable
to
get
it
as
they
state
in
their
exhibit
11.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
strike
is
prohibited
by
law
without
a
penalty.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
they
were
asking
for
it.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
probably
not.
possibly
not,
possibly
not
in
the
sense
in
that
perhaps
their
concern
was
that
this
kind
of
it
that
the
wisconsin
no-strike
law
was
not
as
pervasive
as
they
thought
and
they
might
have
been
right
in
that
because
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said,
there
is
nothing
automatic
about
any
penalty
if
they
have
been
wanting
to
bargain
that
into
their
agreement
in
order
to
make
things
automatic
under
their
agreement.
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
cannot
take
that
into
consideration
in
other
accounts
that
we
do
not
like
that
teacher
and
it
would
be
best
for
the
school
system
to
have
another
set
of
teachers
because
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
answer
is
no
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
no
i
do
not
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
school
system
is
represented
in
the
hearing
before
the
impartial
decision
maker.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
can
take
that
into
account
in
determining
an
appropriate
penalty,
it
is
one
factor.
it
is
one
factor
to
take
into
account.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
thought
that
the
question
was
can
the
board
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
suppose
i
do
not
think
you
can
separate
the
punishment
aspects
so
i
would
again
say
no.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
are
many
times
when
governmental
employers
are
making
decisions
which
do
not
affect
property
and
liberty
interest.
in
those
areas
they
have
absolute,
almost
unfettered
discretion.
when
they
infringe
upon
property
and
liberty
interest,
then
other
factors
come
into
consideration.
you
cannot
destroy
my
judgment
or
view
due
process,
property
or
liberty
interest
by
cloaking
yourself
by
saying,
“we
are
doing
this
in
the
best
interest
of
the
school
system.”
anybody
can
say
that,
any
governmental
agency
can
say
they
are
doing
something
in
the
best
interest
of
the
school
system,
but
in
the
process
of
process
of
property
and
liberty
interest
are
destroyed,
due
process
considerations
come
into
play.
so
it
is
just
a
factor
in
determining
whether
to
destroy
the
property
interest
of
the
teachers
and
the
liberty
interest
of
the
teachers.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
if
--
not
necessarily
because
you
could
have
a
breach
of
contract,
but
not
the
total
destruction
of
the
property
interest.
part
of
it
all
is
here
is
that
the
--
well
for
one
thing,
breach
of
contract
might
not
necessarily
get
your
jobs
back.
there
might
just
be
money
damages
in
the
breach
of
contract
situation.
the
contracts,
there
is
the
future
property
interest
and
expectations
of
employment
under
wisconsin
and
which
probably
cannot
be
reached
by
a
breach
of
contract
action
and
primarily
it
is,
it
is
a
part
of
it.
the
penalty
--
this
is
--
this
is
a
teacher
discipline
case
for
alleged
wrong
doing
and
the
penalty
must
be
reasonable
under
wisconsin
law,
there
is
nothing
automatic.
that
being
the
case
since
property
interests
are
being
infringed
upon,
it
follows
that
the
decision
maker
must
be
impartial.
he
cannot
be
a
partial
biased
decision
maker.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
might
be
able
to,
but
if
that
is
a
correct
statement
mr.
justice
rehnquist
of
wis
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
might,
i
do
not
know
because
this
is
--
this
is
a
groundbreaking
case
as
far
as
wisconsin
law
is
concerned,
but
assuming
that
that
is
correct
then
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
federal
issue
for
this
court
because
all
is
being
said
then
is
that
--
is
that
when
do
we
get
our
hearing,
now
or
in
a
year
and
that
does
not
seem
to
be
important.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
federal
issue
they
decided
was
that
there
has
to
be
an
impartial
decision
maker.
i
might
be
mistaken
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
right,
i
will
address
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
not
at
all,
the
bias
or
prejudgment
decision
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
seems
to
fall
within
every
classic
definition
as
expressed
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
withrow
versus
larkin
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
i
am
familiar
with
it.
first
of
all,
the
board
in
the
trial
court
never
seem
to
really
deny,
although
they
did
in
a
way,
but
their
position
in
the
trail
court
was
not
that
they
were
unbiased,
their
position
as
adapted
by
the
trial
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
for
bias?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
in
some
circumstances
i
think
that
the
presumption
as
i
read
the
opinion
drops
and
those
are
circumstances
where
the
person
who
is
the
decision
maker
is
an
adversary.
if
i
am
reading
your
opinion
correctly,
murchison
was
distinguished
on
exactly
that
ground.
we
have
the
adversary
situation
here,
and
therefore,
the
language
implied
in
murchison
should
come
roaring
back
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
is
a
participant
in
the
dispute,
a
participant
in
dispute
not
who
are
involved
in
the
very
events
in
which
they
are
about
to
judge,
totally
different
with
withrow
versus
larkin
with
the
board,
was
not
involved
with
the
events
of
the
charges
being
alleged
against
doctor
larkin.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
they
have
a
monetary
interest
on
several
grounds
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
there
is
a
personal
monetary
interest
in
that,
there
is
many
of
these
people
are
very
large
property
owners
in
the
area,
but
in
addition
to
that
they
have
a
classic
award
dilemma
by
their
institutionalization
of
their
situation
in
that
they
are
to
decide
the
monetary
policies
of
the
school
district.
they
are
charged
with
the
decision
to
make
monetary
decisions.
there
is
a
monetary
dispute
in
part
with
their
employees.
they
can
seize
upon
something
and
which
is
a
strike
situation
and
in
one
swoop
as
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said,
get
rid
of
their
problems.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
monet,
no
--
the
monet,
no.
that
is,
that
--
once
that
decision
is
made,
that
means
that
there
might
be
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
choices
are,
and
all
but
one
of
them
do
not
infringe
one
property
interest.
they
can
go
to
court
for
an
injunction.
they
cannot
order
the
injunction.
they
must
seek
an
injunction
from
an
impartial
decision
maker
and
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
an
injunction
under
wisconsin
law,
it
is
not
automatic.
that
does
not
infringe
upon
property
or
liberty
interest
because
there
will
be
an
intervention
of
a
third
party
who
is
impartial.
they
can
mediate,
which
has
no
effect
on
property
or
liberty
interest,
mediate
the
dispute,
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that
is
part
of
the
mediation
process.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
part
of,
it
is
part
of
negotiations,
it
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
you
would
mediate
the
late,
the
labor
dispute
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
but
one
of
those
responses,
the
one
that
was
chosen
here
infringes
property
and
liberty
interest,
the
others
do
not,
and
therefore,
due
process
comes
in
to
play.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
mean
to
quibble
right
here
mr.
chief
justice
with
the
word
illegal.
the
wisconsin
statute
says
it
is
prohibited
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
jaywalking
under
the
wisconsin
statutes
have
more
definitive
penalties
than
this.
they
were
in
a
prohibited
strike
the
same
as
the
board
itself,
if
they
might
be
in
a
prohibited
practice
if
they
do
not
bargain.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
they
authorized
discharge
as
one
of
a
range
of
penalties
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
but
it
is
not
required
that
discharge
be
imposed,
just
as
in
arnett
versus
kennedy,
it
is
not
required
that
discharge
be
imposed
and
because,
because
the
property
interest
were
being
affected,
due
process
considerations
come
in
to
play.
if
the
wisconsin
legislature
had
said
as
congress,
that
discharge
is
automatic,
this
would
be
a
totally
different
case.
then
probably
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
know
which
page
you
are
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
am
sorry,
what
is
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
there
is
another
place
and
that
is
on
the
appendix
page
257,
i
will
find
it
in,
yes
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
that
is
the
opinion
i
will
have
to
--
appendix
page,
257
of
the
major
appendix,
and
they
state
in
those
situations,
in
the
first
paragraph,
in
those
situation
where
an
employed
teacher
is
discharged
or
otherwise
disciplined
in
due
processes
required
and
the
school
board
is
in
an
adversary
position,
they
provide
this
review.
i
think
that
is
an
implicit
finding
of
an
adversary
position.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
not
in
the
opinion.
however,
that
i
think
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
not
necessarily.
we
have
been
deprived
--
we
have
been
deprived
of
a
trial
hearing
in
this
matter.
this
is
case
is
up
on
a
grant
of
summary
judgment
in
the
lower
court
and
a
reversal
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that
issue
almost
concedes
that
they
were
biased,
by
the
way
it
was
presented
by
them,
but,
but
we
try
to
make
a
record
before
the
board
in
the
hearing
and
the
board
said
it
was
not
relevant.
we
wanted
a
trail
type
setting
in
the
trail
court
and
the
trial
court
said
these
was
all
irrelevant
so
we
do
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
in
that
event
--
by
the
way,
we
assert
in
our
request
that
this
court
and
allege
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
because
there
has
been
no
final
judgment
in
the
case.
all
that
is
up
here
is
an
effect,
an
interlocutory
appeal
of
a
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
to
determine
all
issues.
i
would
assume
that
if
the
board
in
that
proceeding
wants
to
challenge
the
decision
on
bias
by
evidence,
they
might
be
able
to
try
it
or
i
do
not
mind
having
a
trial
on
that.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that
is
correct,
they
did
do
that.
however,
even
if
the
court
order
say
the
record
is
not
sufficient
to
support,
by
the
way
there
is
more
in
the
record
besides
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said.
there
is
prejudgment
shown
in
this
case
by
exhibit
11
on
the
appendix,
page
112
where
they
said,
weeks
before
what
they
were
going
to
do
before
there
was
any
hearing
or
any
notice.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
but
it
had
not
been
tried
either
by
the
trial
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
they
had
said
at
appendix,
page
112,
exhibit
11,
as
to
how
they
viewed
their
options.
they
viewed
one
of
their
--
the
board
and
they
viewed
weeks
before
these
hearings
and
they
stated
specifically
that
one
of
their
options
would
be
to
discharge
them
in
hire
permanent
replacements.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
the
judge
who
conducts
a
preliminary
hearing
and
finds
probable
cause
is
not
the
victim
in
the
alleged
crime.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
if
their
option
is
to
seek
discharge
under
the
law
and
perhaps
to
hire
permanent
replacements,
it
would
be
just
like
saying
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
like
seeking
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
unless
it
is
--
unless
it
is
governmental
unit
in
which
case
there
has
to
be
due
process.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
view
it
as
thought
they
were
to
say,
we
will
issue
an
injunction.
well,
they
cannot
issue
an
injunction
just
like
they
cannot
totally
discharge.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
an
alternative
potential.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
would
state
it
differently
that
they
have
to
--
once
that
is
there
they
can
penalize
them
by
suspension,
that
was
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
legally
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
legally
valid,
but
--
it
is
legally
valid,
but
it
must
comply
with
due
process.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
there
is
--
i
would
equate
it
with
a
similar
thing
like
a
robbery
case
where
the
penalty
can
be
30
years.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
one
of
the
potential
penalties,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
like
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
like
a
robbery
case
in
wisconsin
with
30
years
as
one
of
the
potential
penalties,
that
does
not
mean
that
if
a
person
pleads
guilty,
the
victim
of
the
armed
robbery
can
be
the
judge
to
impose
the
penalty.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said
they
were
appropriate
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
do
not
think
mr.
justice
powell,
the
court
could
say
on
this
record
that
they
were
unbiased.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
in
other
words,
the
bias
issue
obviously
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
oh
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
we
were
not
allowed
an
opportunity
to
prevent
--
present
full
medicating
circumstances.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
but
the
hearings
were
all
put
together
and
as
one
massive
hearing
and
substantial
evidence
wanted
--
was
presented
or
attempted
to
be
presented
for
mitigation.
they
refused
to
hear
it
so
we
were
denied
a
fair
hearing
in
the
first
instance,
i
might
add
we
were
denied
proper
notice
also
because
the
notice
did
not
say
that
the
board
was
considering
infringement
of
the
contract
for
the
74-75
school
year.
they
only
talked
about
the
present
contract.
so
no,
we
were
not
provided
the
proper
hearing.
in
fact
there
is
some
--
it
would
be
the
same
thing
as
our
durkin
case
in
that
respect
where
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said
if
there
is
an
improper
hearing
in
a
disciplinary
proceeding
involving
a
strike,
they
can
send
it
back
for
further
proceedings.
the
problem
is
that
our
mitigating
factors
in
this
instance
attack
the
very
board
who
was
to
sit
as
our
judges.
