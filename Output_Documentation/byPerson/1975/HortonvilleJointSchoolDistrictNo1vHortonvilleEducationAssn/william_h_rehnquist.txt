justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
neither
of
these
methods,
mr.
walker,
you
mentioned
the
common
law
of
writ
of
certiorari,
then
what
was
the
other
method?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
teachers
have
gone
directly
onto
court
where
they
sued
for
breach
of
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
as
if
it
were
a
private
employer’s
whose
action
were
being
reviewed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
a
private
employer
under
federal
law
has
to
fire
a
striker
or
an
employee
who
is
drunk?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
penalty
must
be
reasonable
under
wisconsin
law,
could
the
not
court
in
a
breach
of
contract
action
take
that
facet
of
wisconsin
law
into
consideration
in
awarding
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
i
was
paraphrasing
your
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
supreme
court
said
that
judicial
type
proceedings
are
over
now
and
then
it
sent
it
back
to
especially
constituted
court
to
perform
the
role
of
an
impartial
decision
maker?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
read
your
supreme
court’s
opinion
not
as
sending
it
back
to
a
trial
court
for
a
determination
of
bias,
but
determining
right
there
that
there
was
bias
and
for
that
reason
saying
it
had
to
go
back
to
this
especially
constituted
circuit
court?
