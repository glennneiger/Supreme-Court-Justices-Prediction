justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
does
the
state
labor
board
after
a
complaint
been
filed,
have
authority
to
award
back
pay
for
teachers
who
have
been
discharged?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
you
commence,
how
many
teachers
in
the
school
system
altogether?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
school
district
as
i
have
read
the
brief,
did
i
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
involved
in
this
litigation,
eighty-five
to
eighty-eight?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
before
you
conclude,
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
school
board
was
an
appropriate
body
to
make
this
decisions,
would
you
still
argue
that
there
was
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
let
us
say
unbiased,
suppose
we
assume
the
board
was
unbiased
and
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
not
my
question,
i
said,
let
us
assume
we
disagree
with
you
and
conclude
that
the
board
was
not
unbiased
and
was
a
proper
agency
to
make
the
decision
it
made,
would
you
still
say
there
had
been
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no,
are
you
satisfied
that
your
clients
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
full
hearing
before
this
agency
which
you
regard
as
biased?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
what
respect
did
they
not?
did
not
the
board
for
each
one
of
them
individually,
a
separate
opportunity
for
a
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
each
of
the
boards
offers
to
have
an
individual
hearing
with
counsel
for
each
teacher?
