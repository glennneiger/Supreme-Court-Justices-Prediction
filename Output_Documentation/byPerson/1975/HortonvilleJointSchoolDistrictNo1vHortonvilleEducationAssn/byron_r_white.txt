where
do
you
go
in
wisconsin,
if
you
do
not
claim
any
anti-union
bias
or
anything,
but
you
just
claim
a
breach
of
contract
in
the
sense
that
the
employer
fired
me
because
he
claimed
i
was
out,
that
i
was
on
strike
and
did
not
work,
he
made
a
mistake,
i
was
not
on
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
a
--
that
teachers
could
be
fired
without
any
hearing
whatsoever
and
even
by
a
bias
board
as
long
as
immediately
they
could
go
into
a
court
and
have
the
entire
matter
de
novo
before
an
unbiased
decision
making?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
at
least
implicitly
said
these
other
remedies
are
not
adequate
too,
did
they
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
permitted
to,
but
he
is
not
required?
justice
byron

that
does
not
have
any
federal
question,
you
just
keep
talking
about
wisconsin
law.
as
i
understood,
we
brought
the
case
here
because
there
was
a
federal
issue
in
it.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decided
that
the
school
board
was
not
a
--
was
not
an
unbiased
body
to
make
any
decision
at
all
and
that
is
the
issue,
that
is
here.
why
should
we
be
arguing
about
what
wisconsin
law
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
not
talk
about
that
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
if
we
said
that
they
were
quite
wrong
on
the
federal
issue,
they
decided
and
remanded
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
--
let
us
assume
you
are
quite
correct
that
whatever
liberty
of
property
interest
involved
are
sufficient
to
invoke
the
due
process
because
you
have
not
yet
suggested
to
us
or
at
least
said
very
much
about
why
even
if
the
board
should
be
unbiased
or
impartial,
why
we
must
assume
that
it
is
not
or
why
we
should
agree
with
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
that
it
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
want
us
to
--
you
do
not
want
us
to
set
aside
that
judgment
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
it
is,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
is
it
some
presumption
that
we
have
to
think?
i
thought
in
the
withrow
and
other
cases
that
in
situations
like
this
you
assume
that
public
officials
will
do
their
job,
we
do
not
certainly
do
not
presume
bias?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
know
if
withrow
against
larkin
and
other
cases
say
just
because
the
same
people
make
a
charge
that
adjudicate
it
does
not
mean
that
the
adjudicators
are
biased?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
think
that
the
school
board
have
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
to
construe
the
law
to
authorize
the
school
board
to
discharge
for
striking
because
it
was
prohibited?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
is
not
just
a
judicial
invention?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
even
if
they
made
a
mistake
it
does
not
prove
they
are
bias,
on
that
basis
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
conduct
some
preliminary
hearing
and
find
probable
cause
and
