mr.
randolph
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
which
is
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
arises
under
the
national
environmental
policy
act
which
i
referred
to
as
nepa
throughout
my
argument,
this
provides
that
an
environmental
impact
statement
shall
be
included
in
every
report
or
recommendation
on
proposals
for
major
federal
actions
significantly
affecting
the
environment.
the
federal
petitioners
violated
the
provision
i
have
just
quoted,
according
to
the
respondents
in
this
case.
because
they
have
not
prepared
one
of
massive
impact
statement
covering
all
federal
activities
relating
to
coal
mining,
in
an
area
respondents
called
the
northern
great
plains
region.
that
is
a
90,000
square
mile
area
describing
their
complaint
as
comprising
north
eastern
wyoming,
eastern
montana,
western
north
dakota
and
western
south
dakota.
i
have
had
distributed
to
the
court
two
maps,
both
of
these
maps
were
taken
from
material
on
the
record.
i
do
not
plan
to
refer
to
them
now,
later
in
my
argument,
i
will
refer
to
them
directly.
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
government
in
the
interveners
in
this
case.
among
the
court's
many
findings
of
fact
at
this
stage
and
on
remand
for
supplementing
the
record,
two
findings
of
fact,
we
believe
are
crucial
and
dispositive
in
this
case.
first,
that
the
northern
great
plains
region,
defined
by
respondents
is
not
“an
entity,
region
or
area,
considered
by
the
federal
government
for
the
purposes
of
any
federal
program,
project
or
action,
second,
that
there
is
no
existing
or
proposed
federal
regional
program,
plan,
project
or
other
regional
federal
action
for
developing
coal
in
the
region
respondents
have
defined”.
the
district
court
with
respect
to
these
two
findings
of
fact
could
not
have
found
otherwise,
our
evidence
was
to
this
effect
in
the
district
court
and
respondents
with
out
offering
any
other
contrary
evidence
not
only
conceded
that
no
plan
or
program
for
development
of
their
northern
great
plains
region
existed,
they
stressed
that
fact,
they
argued
to
the
district
court,
they
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
nepa
compelled
the
government
to
adopt
such
regional
plan
or
proposal,
an
argument
that
in
this
court
they
now
have
extensively
dropped.
i
will
mention
briefly
a
number
of
the
other
district
courts
findings
of
fact
and
then
proceed
in
my
argument
and
these
were
findings
taken
both
from
the
original
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
from
the
remand.
one,
that
the
government
has
prepared
and
will
continue
to
prepare
environmental
impact
statements
for
group
of
mines
or
individual
mines
within
the
area
described
in
respondents
complaint.
these
impact
statements,
the
court
found
to
be,
at
page
114
(a)
and
115
(a)
of
the
petition
appendix.
these
statements
the
court
found
to
be
comprehensive
and
noted
that
they
assess
the
cumulative
impacts
of
coal
mining
and
related
activities.
one
of
the
statements,
impact
statements
that
the
district
court
considered
is
the
six
volume
eastern
powder
river
basin
impact
statement
and
through
the
benefit
of
the
court,
this
is
before
the
court,
but,
i
brought
a
copy
in
so
the
court
might
see
what
an
impact
statement
looks
like,
all
six
volumes,
they
--
it
covers
an
area
in
wyoming
of
approximately,
i
cannot
lift
it,
i
would
but[laughter]
mr.
randolph
this
covers
an
area
in
north
eastern
wyoming
of
approximately
7500
square
miles,
which
is
about
the
size
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
the
focus
is
on
four
mining
plans
and
a
railroad
right
away.
as
i
said,
the
district
court
found
that
that
statement
was
comprehensive
and
had
such
cumulative
impacts
of
coal
mining.
the
district
court
found
in
addition
that
since
of
1970,
the
government,
the
federal
government
in
cooperation
with
states
industry,
private
groups,
other
individuals,
local
governments
had
conducted
various
coal
related
studies
in
the
western
states.
this
was
studied
only,
i
must
emphasis.
one
of
these
which
was
primarily
mentioned
in
the
briefs
and
also
in
opinions
below
is
the
northern
great
plains
resources
program,
the
ngprp
is
sometimes
referred,
which
was
began
in
1972.
this
was
a
joint
investigation
by
the
states
of
wyoming,
montana,
nebraska,
north
dakota
and
south
dakota
that
collected
data
on
geology,
minerals,
including
coal,
and
mainly
coal.
air
quality,
social
and
economic
conditions
and
so
forth
and
analyzed
all
this
material
on
the
basis
of
possible
development
scenarios,
the
study
or
the
program
as
i
should
refer
to
proposed
no
regional
plan,
it
suggested
no
preferred
development
program,
it
suggested
no
development
program
whatsoever,
it
was
not
designed
to
the
district
court
so
found.
the
district
court
also
found
that
since
1973,
the
secretary
of
interior
had
continued
in
effect
but
was
a
virtual
moratorium
a
private
coal
development,
a
new
private
coal
development
in
the
federal
coal
reserves
throughout
the
country.
during
this
period
at
a
national
impact
statement
or
as
it
sometimes
referred
to
a
coal
programmatic
was
prepared.
this
assessed,
the
old
procedures
that
the
secretary
had
utilize
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
and
formulated
a
new
process
applicable
nationwide
for
implementing
that
same
act.
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence
the
district
court
found
that
the
government
had
taken
action
under
nepa,
but
it
was
national
action
in
scope.
the
action
was
on
a
national
basis
as
to
the
region,
that
we
are
discussing
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
as
i
stressed
before,
there
was
no
special
plan
or
program
for
that
reason
as
such
and
certainly
no
regional
action.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
with
one
judge
dissenting.
the
court
majority
accepted
the
law
records
findings
of
fact
but
held
that
the
government
was
and
i
used
the
court's
word
contemplating
a
regional
program.
the
relevance
of
this
apparently
was
that
under
the
lower
courts,
court
of
appeals
view
an
impact
statement
under
the
statute
nepa
must
be
issued
well
and
advance
of
any
report
on
proposals
for
major
federal
action,
there
ago
contemplation
could
trigger
the
impact
statement
requirement,
must
stress
though
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that
the
government
had
yet
violated
nepa.
but
only
that
it
would
if
it
kept
following
the
course
that
the
court
thought
it
was
following
and
in
light
of
this
the
court
issued
a
remand
order,
instructed
the
government
to
announce
whether
it
would
do
one
impact
statement
covering
this
90,000
square
mile
area.
in
january,
this
court
staid
the
court
of
appeals
injunction
which
had
prevented
the
secretary
of
interior
from
taking
action
with
respect
to
the
four
pending
mining
plans
analyzed
in
the
eastern
powder
river
basin
impact
statement.
thereafter
in
february
of
this
year,
the
secretary
approved
those
four
mining
plans.
as
i
stated
at
the
outset
we
think
that
the
district
court's
decision
on
this
case
is
correct
and
we
think
that
the
district
courts
findings
affect
in
this
case.
the
government
has
completed
a
national
impact
statement
covering
a
coal
leasing
policies
nationwide.
it
includes
in
analysis
the
four
states
here
it
includes
an
analysis
of
every
state
where
federal
land
is
located.
it
has
completed
this
massive
impact
statements
covering
the
eastern
powder
river
basin
in
wyoming.
that
statement
has
not
been
challenged
in
any
court,
in
fact
the
statement
covers
three
quarters
of
all
the
economically
recoverable
coal
by
strip-mining
in
the
area
that
respondents
defined
as
the
northern
great
plains
region.
mr.
randolph
yes.
it
was
a
national
program
and
it
was
major
federal
action
but
it
was
nationwide.
it
is
been
filed
--
that
government
also
has
issued
impact
statements
for
individual
mines,
for
clusters
of
mines
and
in
fact
will
continue
to
do
so.
the
argument
here
however
is
that
none
of
this
is
sufficient,
that
an
impact
statement
must
be
done
for
an
area
smaller
than
the
united
states
but
larger
than
the
eastern
powder
river
basin
which
is
the
size
on
the
state
of
new
jersey
as
i
stated.
even
if
respondents
are
right
that
would
be
a
good
idea
and
we
do
not
think
it
would
be.
we
do
think
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
is
not
mandated.
mr.
randolph
no,
it
does
not
file,
it
distributes
in
a
draft
form
to
–
mr.
randolph
what
it
has
done,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
published
and
i
will
give
the
court
this
if
i
can
find
it.
in
41
fed.
reg.
11035
in
march
of
this
year,
a
series
of
regulations
implementing
the
proposals
and
suggestions
and
the
formulated
policy
that
the
national
impacts
statements
prepares.
so,
in
other
words
they
did
an
impact
statement,
they
assessed
the
national
coal
policy
and
in
41
federal
register
they
have
now
published
regulations
which
the
secretary
expects
to
implement
taking
the
suggestions
and
putting
into
the
policy
of
the
environmental
fact.
mr.
randolph
the
major
federal,
the
major
federal
action
would
be
the
secretary's
adoption
which
he
did.
i
think
there
is
an
appendix
to
the
green
brief
by
the
american
electric
power
company
that
shows
on
january
of
this
year,
the
secretary
adopted
the
new
mineral
leasing
program
suggested
in
the
national
impact
statement.
mr.
randolph
of
course
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
randolph
and
what
is
an
issue
in
this
case,
in
fact,
is
whether
he
has
to
do
an
impact
statement
for
the
area
that
respondents
have
described
in
addition
to
the
ones
he
has
already
done
and
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
the
statute
says,
is
that
a
final
impact
statement
must
be
issued
with
each
report
or
recommendation
on
proposals
for
major
federal
action.
in
this
case.
mr.
randolph
yes,
there
is
no
legislation
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
district
court
as
i
stated,
found
that
a
regional
plan
does
not
exist
and
has
not
been
proposed
for
this
region
that
we
are
talking
about.
certainly,
if
it
has
not
been
proposed,
there
is
no
report
or
recommendation
on
such
a
regional
proposal
for
development,
the
district
court
so
found.
the
only
proposals
in
existence
here,
private
applications
that
the
government
must
act
on.
the
district
court
found
none
of
the
private
applications
are
for
regional
action.
the
grant
of
one
coal
mining
lease
does
not
commit
the
secretary
of
interior
the
grant
on
another
any
place
else
in
that
region.
what
then
are
the
relevant
major
federal
actions
in
this
case?
the
national
coal
leasing
program
we
have
discussed
but
we
have
done
an
impact
statement
on
that.
at
lease,
only
the
approval
of
particular
leases,
mining
plans,
rights
of
way
and
so
forth,
to
be
sure
these
have
to
be
the
subject
of
environmental
impact
statements
and
they
will
be
if
they
are
not
already
the
subject
of
environmental
impact
statement.
but,
in
the
absence
of
a
proposal
for
regional
action
and
a
report
on
that
kind
of
a
proposal,
nepa
does
not
require
a
regional
impact
statement,
otherwise,
realize
what
a
court
is
saying
to
the
federal
agency,
it
is
saying,
well,
you
do
not
have
a
regional
development
program
but
we
are
going
to
order
you
to
do
a
regional
impact
statement
evaluating
the
environmental
effects
of
the
regional
action,
you
would
have
planned,
if
you
have
a
regional
a
program.
and,
on
top
of
that,
since
nepa
requires
you
to
consider
alternatives,
we
are
going
to
ask
you,
direct
you
to
consider
the
alternatives
to
the
regional
action,
you
do
not
have
planned
but
you
would
have
planned
if
you
had.
we
do
not
think
that
makes
any
sense.
mr.
randolph
yes,
that
could
be
done.
mr.
randolph
they
could
and
they
have
and
environmental
rules
have
asked
for
that
in
number
of
different
cases
and
the
circuits
around
the
country.
i
have
looked
at
the
scope
of
the
impact
statement.
does
it
assess
the
cumulative
affects
of
one
more
mine,
one
more
mine.
is
it
comprehensive?
does
it
consider
not
only
the
effect
of
this
mine
but
the
secondary
effects?
that
is
the
test;
this
statement
has
not
been
challenged.
the
statement
does
that
according
to
the
findings
of
fact
to
the
district
court
on
page
114
(a)
of
the
petition.
so,
we
think
that
district
courts
findings
of
fact,
that
there
is
no
regional
plan
existing
or
proposed
or
conclusive
and
in
this
case.
that
is
not
a
very
complex
analysis,
we
admit.
but
nepa,
i
think
i
should
remind,
requires
impact
statements
for
actions
not
for
areas,
and
we
think,
that
our
analysis
is
a
proper
analysis
as
to
the
other
circuits
including
now
the
second
circuit
on
remand
from
this
court
reversing
its
prior
decision
in
the
conservation
society
case.
we
think
that
the
paraphrase
chief
justice
marshall,
we
must
never
forget
that
it
is
a
statute
we
are
expounding
here,
and
if
that
is
forgotten,
if
a
court
goes
further
than
that
as
respondents’
ask
this
court
to
do,
it
enters
a
never,
never
land.
suppose
five
or
ten
or
any
number
of
suits
were
brought
in
regard
to
the
area
that
we
are
talking
about
in
the
midwest,
some
pick
the
different
area
for
study,
some
pick
overlapping
areas,
others
pick
areas
that
were
smaller,
other’s
larger,
some
independent.
i
submit
there
is
absolutely
no
principled
way
for
a
court
to
say,
after
shifting
to
all
the
environmental
studies
and
statistics
that
here,
this
is
the
one
area
under
nepa
that
you
must
study,
federal
agency.
now,
respondents
have
proposed
a
test
to
enable
a
court
to
do
that.
a
court
of
three
adverb
test
although
i
am
not
sure
they
are
all
proper
adverbs
and
it
is
a
test
i
must
add
that
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
itself
did
not
adopt.
respondents
say
that
the
area
they
have
chosen
is
mandatory
because
all
federal
actions
there
are,
now
i
use
their
adverbs
geographically,
environmentally
and
programmatically
related.
this
is
summarized
in
their
brief
at
pages
28
to
29
and
then
expanded
upon
throughout.
i
will
take
the
least
likely
adverb
first,
programmatically---
mr.
randolph
environmentally.
mr.
randolph
environmentally,
i
take
the
least
likely
adverb
first,
programmatically.
now,
i
suppose
what
they
mean
by
this
is
that
all
federal
actions
regarding
coal
development
in
the
area
take
place
under
the
same
federal
program,
if
they
are
referring
to
the
national
program,
for
implementing
the
mineral
leasing
act,
their
assertion
is
true
but
irrelevant.
one
could
draw
a
line
around
any
piece
of
federal
land
in
the
united
states
and
make
the
same
statement.
it
does
not
lead
to
their
region
at
all.
if
they
are
referring
to
some
other
program
for
development
of
their
region,
their
statement
is
in
flat,
direct,
contradiction
of
the
findings
of
fact
at
the
district
court
that
there
is
no
such
program
existing
or
proposed.
a
finding
of
fact
as
i
stated
that
respondents’
themselves
conceded.
now,
they
make
two
other
statements;
they
are
geographically
and
environmentally
related.
i
think
these
statements
and
we
submit
these
statements
are
meaningless
also,
if
one
encircles
any
area
within
the
united
states,
one
can
say
that
all
the
actions
within
that
area
are
geographically
related.
it
is
likewise
environmentally
related
in
the
sense
that
the
effects
on
the
environment
from
activities
within
the
region
will
be
of
course,
felt
within
the
region.
respondent's
answer
to
this
is
that
our
region
makes
sense
because
and
i
quote
from
their
brief
at
104
“it
is
a
geologic
fact,
the
extent
of
the
region
is
defined
simply
by
the
presence
of
coal”
for
this
they
cite
their
map,
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
on
page
103
of
the
respondent's
brief.
the
shaded
portion
of
that
map
at
103
respondents
task
represents
and
they
say
the
fort
union
on
powder
river
coal
formations
and
that
is
the
extend
of
the
region.
we
submit
that
map
is
highly
misleading
and
certainly
inaccurate.
in
the
first
place,
it
admits
all
the
coal
fields
in
the
states
that
they
have
dealt
with
here
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment,
first
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
geologic
fact
--
mr.
randolph
well,
there
was
a
map
that
was
contained
in
the
back
pocket
of
the
northern
great
plains
resources
program
that
was
a
geologic
map.
they
referenced
that
map
on
the
right
hand
corner
page
103,
and
they
say
they
have
drawn
this
from
that
map,
and
that
is
what
i
am
just
about
to
discuss
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
first
of
all,
what
is
they
talk
about
the
fort
union
in
powder
river
coal
formations.
in
fact,
what
this
map
shows
is
the
surface
exposure
only
of
a
portion
of
the
fort
union
rock
formation.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
powder
river
rock
formation
and
in
fact
to
be
precise
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
coal
formation
at
all.
what
the
error
is
the
phrase
is
sometimes
used
i
admit.
what
in
fact
you
have
are
coal
seams
in
rock
formations.
so,
to
get
this
straight
they
have
drawn
here
the
surface
exposure
of
the
portion
of
one
rock
formation,
the
fort
union
rock
formation.
now,
what
they
have
left
out
even
in
respect
of
this
is
the
fact
that
the
fort
union
rock
formation
goes
on
for
miles
and
miles
and
miles
beyond
this
area
they
have
drawn,
in
fact--
mr.
randolph
i
will
make
that
point.
but
to
sum
this
up
as
far
as
their
map
is
concerned;
they
have
left
about
a
100,000
miles
of
the
fort
union
rock
formation.
there
is
coal
in
the
fort
union
rock
formation
and
i
will
give
the
court
the
pages,
pages
218
to
220
of
the
national
impact
statement
reports
coal
in
the
fort
union
rock
formation
is
far
south
as
the
colorado
utah
border
that
runs
in
to,
i
think
it
runs
in
the
idaho.
it
is
a
green
river
coal
field.
anyway,
they
are
about
a
hundred
thousand
miles
off
if
they
are
drawing
the
fort
union
rock
formation.
mr.
randolph
well,
that
is
right,
they
found
this
in
the
geologic
map,
but,
i
think
they
--
mr.
randolph
no,
they
have
in
fact
tried
to,
they
have
another
line
around
this,
they
tried
to
duplicate
the
northern
great
plains
resources
programs
study
area
but
they
left
out
the
state
of
nebraska
which
that
also
studied
and
that
study
considered
various
different
areas
throughout
the
different
states
for
different
programs.
it
did
not
propose
anything,
it
was
a
development
program
--
the
reason
we
admit.
mr.
randolph
the
precise
area
that
they
defined
is
their
area,
yes.
the
area
just
the
miles,
square
miles
covered
by
the
northern
great
plains
resources
programs
is
a
140,000
square
miles
there,
theirs
is
about
90,000
square
miles.
it
takes
in
part
of
the
area
that
this
program
is
studied.
right
before
we
break,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
our
map
in
the
yellow
portion.
the
under
lay
on
this
map
is
what
we
understand
to
be
their
region.
if
they
had
drawn
the
coal
field
rather
than
the
rock
formation
which
is
not,
so
they
do
not
correspond
but
the
under
layers
is
what
we
understand
to
be
their
region.
they
say
the
extent
of
our
region
is
defined
by
the
presence
of
coal.
the
over
lay
is
the
presence
of
coal
and
i
do
not
think
one
has
other
coal
fields
that
look
like
a
boxwork,
shocking
block
test,
but
there
are
other
coal
fields
throughout
the
area.
i
do
not
think
that
one
has
to
be
versed,
including
geometry
to
see
that
on
that
map,
any
number,
countless
numbers
of
lines
could
be
drawn
about
around
countless
numbers
of
areas.
now,
if
it
is
simply
the
presence
of
coal
that
defines
the
region
where
does
one
draw
the
line?
this
map
is
a
little
misleading
too,
because
that
is
a
macro
view,
and
if
the
court
gets
the
impression
that
all
that
coal
is
mineable,
it
is
a
wrong
impression.
i
have
to
spell
after
lunch.
mr.
randolph
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
photo
of
the
map
we
have
is
kind
of
a
macro
view,
not
very
well
focus
satellite
picture
coal
field.
the
other
map
we
have
however
is
a
very
focused
picture
of
the
surface
mineable
coal
deposits
in
the
area,
generally
represented
i
think
by
respondents
complaint.
when
one
looks
at
this
map
in
the
blackened
areas
are
the
areas
of
the
surface
mineable
coal
--
mr.
randolph
the
photographic
reduction
of
a
very
large
map
that
is
--now,
the
blackened
areas
are
the
economically
recoverable
coal
in
the
portion
on
the
yellow
map
that
is
represented
by
the
underlay.
this
map
that
i
am
referring
to
now
shows
the
economically
recoverable
coal
there.
my
point
about
this
is
that
when
one
does
focus
down
even
more
sharply
into
this
area,
where
does
one
draw
the
line?
now,
i
would
suggest
just
on
a
look
at
this
map
that
one
logical
place
to
draw
a
line
around
is
in
the
lower
part
of
the
map,
in
a
series
of
mines
that
runs
north
to
south
with
the
number
71210834,
the
courts
sees
that.
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
map,
on
the
left
hand
side
towards
west,
there
is
a
series
of
mines
with
numbers
by
71210834
that
is
where
the
secretary
of
interiors
draws
line.
he
encompassed
that
area
with
the
50
mile
wide
swatch
that
runs
a
150
miles
north
and
south.
that
is
the
eastern
powder
river
basin.
it
is
called
that
because
it
is
to
the
east
of
the
powder
river
that
lies
in
the
shallow
earth
formation.
as
i
said,
not
all
the
coal
in
this
area
is
in
the
fort
union
rock
formation,
much
of
the
coal
there
is
in
what
they
call
the
visage
(ph)
formation
but
again
my
point
in
all
this,
the
conclusion
from
all
these
maps
is
that
the
kind
of
geological
mistakes,
i
have
been
talking
about,
we
think
are
inevitable,
unless
in
the
absence
of
a
regional
plan
for
development,
it
is
left
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
who
has
the
expertise
in
geology,
who
has
the
expertise
in
environmental
considerations,
who
has
the
expertise
in
administering
his
own
program,
that
is
just
left
to
him
to
define
the
appropriate
areas
for
study
in
his
administration
of
mineral
leasing
act?
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
some
are
under
way,
the
--
mr.
randolph
yes.
i
would
–
mr.
randolph
these
are
two
other
mines
for
which
individual
impact
statements
are
prepared
for
them.
and
also,
i
might
add
to
the
court
the
--
there
are
two
other
clusters
of
mines
on
this
map,
one
in
the
upper
right
hand
portion
of
the
map
and
another
in
the
middle
portion
of
the
map.
impacts,
regional
impact
statements
considering
all
those
mines
are
going
to
be
prepared.
the
secretary
of
interior
announce
the
congress,
the
senate
committee
about
two
months
ago.
again,
my
point
in
all
these
is
that
in
the
absence
of
a
regional
plan,
the
definition
of
the
area
to
be
covered
has
to
be
left
to
the
secretary,
it
is
at
his
discretion.
i
think
one
of
the
curiosities
of
this
case
is
that
respondents
rely
upon
a
case
called
udall
v.
tallman
which
as
the
court
remembers
as
the
case
that
says
in
regard
to
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
by
an
official
who
administers
that
statute.
it
is
entitled
a
great
way.
the
statute
in
that
case
was
the
mineral
leasing
act.
the
official
who
administered
it
was
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
randolph
absolutely
not.
such
studies
mr.
justice
rehnquist
are
under
way
all
the
time
continuously.
the
very
existence
for
the
bureau
of
land
management,
the
very
reason
for
the
existence
of
bureau
of
land
management
of
course
is
to
manage
the
federal
lands
and
they
are
constantly
studying
the
resources
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
the
bureau
of
mines
is
not
really
a
regulatory
agency,
it
is
really
a
research
agency
and
they
conduct
studies
all
the
time.
various
areas
are
constantly
being
studied.
i
think
all
the
federal
land
at
one
point
or
another
is
under
constant
analysis
and
study
for
coal
mines,
for
various
things.
so,
we
do
not
think
that
would
require
an
impact
statement,
i
think
the
result
of
that
would
deter
the
governmental
agencies
from
studying
the
material.
now,
suppose,
everything
i
have
told
the
court,
at
least
in
the
argument
portion
so
far,
suppose
i
am
mistaken,
suppose
i
am
wrong,
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
accurately
detected
that
a
regional
development
plan
is
in
fact
contemplated
and
that,
it
just
so
happens
that
this
regional
plan,
the
government
is
supposedly
pondering
corresponds.
it
just
happens
to
correspond
with
the
region
that
respondents
have
identified.
nevertheless,
we
submit
the
government
still
prevails
in
this
case.
the
fact
is
nepa
does
not
say
or
even
imply
that
an
impact
statement
must
be
done
on
contemplation.
nepa
does
not
say
that
an
impact
statement
must
be
done
when
that
contemplation
somehow
mystically
arises
to
the
level
of
a
proposal.
what
the
statute
does
say,
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
this
out
early
in
my
argument,
it
says
that
an
impact
statement
must
be
done
included
in
a
report
on
the
proposal
and
scrap
two,
this
court
decision
in
scrap
two
said
and
held
“the
statute
means
what
it
says”,
i
quote
from
the
opinion.
the
time
at
which
an
agency
must
prepared
the
final
statement
is
the
time
at
which
it
makes
a
recommendation
or
report
on
a
proposal
for
federal
action.
even
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
said
the
only
thing
that
exists
here
is
some
contemplation.
that
time
has
not
arrived
and
we
submit,
it
may
never
arrive,
and
matter
of
fact
we
go
further.
we
said,
we
would
submit
it
will
never
arrive.
the
court
below,
we
think
therefore,
should
have
affirmed.
in
the
absence
of
a
violation
of
nepa
and
the
court
below
found
none.
it
was
improper
for
that
court
to
continue
the
injunction
which
prevented
the
secretary
of
interior
from
taking
actions
that
have
already
been
fully
analyzed
and
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
a
comprehensive
impact
statement
that
assesses
the
cumulative
consequences
of
coal
mining.
that
is
the
statement
for
the
eastern
powder
river
basin.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice.
