mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
wyoming
and
21
other
amicus
states.
because
we
have
a
lot
of
stake
we
think
in
the
decision
that
this
court
reaches
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
nepa
contemplates
a
major
state
role
in
the
implementation
of
the
act.
we
know,
from
experience
that
the
impact
of
the
federal
programs
on
our
states
are
tremendous
and
we
believe
that
program
environmental
impact
statements
are
truly
the
only
means
that
we
have
of
determining
the
scope
and
the
magnitude
of
these
federal
programs.
we
think
that
interior,
the
department
of
the
interior
would
defeat
those
objectives
by
preparing
environmental
impact
statements
under
nepa
on
a
project
by
project
basis,
and
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
real
issue
in
this
case.
now,
let
me
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
the
wyoming
experience
and
what
is
happening
on
ground
in
my
state.
at
last
count,
we
have
no
fewer
than
134
coal
leases,
pending
applications
or
prospecting
permits
in
the
eastern
powder
river
basin.
projections
for
the
next
few
years
in
the
north
eastern
part
of
our
state
call
for
34
strip
mines,
nine
electric
power
and
coal
gasification
plants.
225
miles
of
new
power
lines
and
150
miles
of
new
rail
road
track.
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
think
that
a
series
of
environmental
impact
statements
on
each
one
of
those
particular
projects,
all
of
which
require
either
directly
or
indirectly
federal
action
before
they
can
come
into
fruition.
we
think
it
is
ridiculous
to
think
that
a
series
of
environmental
impacts
statements
on
those
projects
will
analyze
what
is
going
to
happen
to
our
state.
in
the
same
way
that
an
environmental
impact
statement
taking
all
of
them
into
consideration
and
determining
the
cumulative
effect
of
all
of
those
projects
would
it
have.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
no
sir.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
yes
sir,
it
has.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
i
believe
that
one
of
the
reasons
and
i
really
cannot,
i
really
perhaps
can't
answer
that
but
i
think
that
they
have
a
facility
which
it
sensed
gone
by
the
boards
your
honor
that
may
have
played
a
part
in
their
decision
not
to
join
in
the
brief,
that
is
really
the
only
reason
that
i
can
give
you
for
that.
after
this
litigation
was
initiated
there
has
been
or
have
been
indications
that
the
department
will
now
agree
to
prepare
sub
regional
impact
statements.
we
suggest
that,
that
is
not
a
great
deal
better,
at
least
the
way
that
we
understand
and
intend
to
do
it
and
project
by
project
basis.
let
me
use
as
an
example
of
this
sheridan
county
wyoming,
there
are
few
--
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
we
do
not
know
your
honor.
we
submit
that
they
should
know.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
we
believe,
we
believe
very
strongly--
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
your
honor,
we
would
differ
with
that.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
what
we
are
saying
in
this
case
your
honor
is
that
in
the
department
of
interior
they
do
in
fact
have
plans
for
an
area
larger
in
scope
to
the
project
by
project
basis
or
even
larger
than
easter
powder
river
basin.
we
do
not
know
where
it
is,
but
we
do
know
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
people
do
in
this
country
face
an
energy
crisis.
we
do
know
that
we
have
enormous
untapped
natural
resources
in
our
state
and
we
do
know
that
the
projects
which
i
have
suggested
--
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
i
think
that
the
first
thing
that
has
to
be
done
is
a
result
of
the
decision
in
this
court.
a
determination
be
made
as
to
the
scope
of
environmental
impact
statement.
if
you
agree
that
nepa
calls
for
an
environmental
impact
statement
on
a
project
by
project
basis
only,
then
i
think
that
obviously
you
would
necessarily
decide
that
our
argument
is
incorrect
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
yes
sir,
i
certainly
do.
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
got
to
that
point
yet.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
not,
if
there
is
a
plan.
they
have
taken
the
position
as
i
understand
the
issue
and
i
cannot
honestly
say
that
i
got
this
understanding
from
my
brother’s
argument.
but
as
i
understand
the
basic
issue
in
the
case,
it
is
whether
or
not
a
project
environmental
impact
statement
is
sufficient.
if
you
agree
that
--
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
if,
if
the
only
proposal
that
they
have
made
but
we
say
that
the
facts
and
the
pronouncements
from
the
department
clearly
demonstrate
that
their
plan
goes
much
further
than
that.
the
leases
that
i
have
mentioned
to
you
point
that
out.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
well,
i
have
got
to
confess
your
honor
that
i
have
got
to
rely
on
mr.
terris
for
that
portion
of
the
argument.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
yes,
that
was
right.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
in
the
way
that
i
read,
contrary
again
to
my
brother's
interpretation,
the
way
that
i
read
that
is
that
court
of
appeals
sent
that
back
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
program
that
was
larger
in
scope
in
than
the
project,
specific
project.
that
is
i
think
extremely
important.
i
started
to
mention
sheridan
county
and
i
think
you
could
note
this
on
the
map,
there
is
a
little
bit
development
anticipated
in
that
county.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
that
is
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
it
is
in
the
area
there
where
three
small
coal
deposit
shown
on
the
left.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
right.
the
projections
for
the
increase
in
the
population
in
that
county
are
only
9%
by
1981.
however,
there
are
extensive
developments
taking
place
south
in
johnson
county
wyoming
and
north
in
big
horn
county
montana.
if
you
take
the
anticipated
development
with
the
accompanying
population
increases
projections
for
those
two
counties
in
addition
to
sheradin
county.
projections
are
that
there
will
be
a
population
increase
in
sheradin
county
alone
of
over
40%
by
1981.
i
think
the
implications
of
that
in
terms
of
the
need
and
demand
for
public
services
are
obvious
and
that
points
out
why
we
believe
that
the
environmental
impact
statement
has
to
take
in
the
consideration
more
than
a
single
project.
now
as
it
is
stated
in
the
amicus
brief
and
i
repeat
here,
we
have
not
taken
a
position
as
22
states
on
what
that
geographical
area
should
be.
we
do
feel
however,
that
it
must
be
broader
and
that
the
act
calls
for
to
be
broader
than
a
project
by
project
basis.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
in
part
your
honor,
some
was
coal
and
some
was
trona.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
trona,
which
is
another
mineral
substance.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
trona,
your
honor.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
no
sir,
not
at
all.
and
this
is
why
feel
that
we
have
such
a
stake
in
this
case.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
that
is
in
part
correct
your
honor.
i
suppose
that
i
would
–
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
we
believe
that
the
development
of
the
west
has
got
to
be
just
because
of
the
pronouncements
and
the
statements
that
have
been
made.
more,
there
is
more
to
it
than
just
a
determination
as
to
whether
they
issue
one
lease.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
yes
sir.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
we
believe
that
we
are,
your
honor.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
yes
sir.
and
we
believe
that
they
have
furthermore,
we
certainly
--
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
no,
we
think
that
we
have
gotten
much
more
than
that
your
honor
and
the
pattern
of
what
has
happened
in
our
state
and
in
the
west
in
the
last
several
months.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
they
have
granted
all
of
these
leases
and
permits
and
they
have
pending
other
applications
for
various
types
of
coal
lease
permits.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
no,
i
am
saying
that
the
pattern
of
issuance
of
those
leases
demonstrates
clearly
that
there
is
more
involved
than
and
simply
a
determination
that
is
specific
lease
should
or
should
not
be
issued.
it
is
a
part
of
a
pattern
to
develop
the
mineral
resources
of
the
west.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
well,
i--
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
no
sir,
but
that
was
initiated.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
after
the
litigation
commenced,
it
relates
to
four
mines,
four
strip
mines
and
the
projector
track
which
--
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
no
sir.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
because
that
impact
statement
was
not
a
part
of
this
litigation
when
it
was
initiated.
it
was
delivered
to
the
court
of
appeals
where
as
a
policy
matter,
we
were
unhappy
with
that
impact
statement
but
we
have
not
taken
any
action
to
attack
it
pending
the
disposition
of
this
case.
there
is
a
separate
question
entirely
and
that
goes
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
impact
statement
assuming
that
there
is
agreement
on
the
scope.
mr.
v.
frank
mendocino
it
is
not
involved
in
the
case
your
honor.
yes,
i
think
we
would
as
to
sufficiency.
