chief

mr.
terris,
before
you
proceed
let
me
put
to
you
the
questions
that
i
put
to
your
colleague,
the
attorney
general,
precisely
what
language
of
section
102,
do
you
call
upon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
interior
and
the
whole
management
program
would
be
doing
this
now
and
before
nepa
was
ever
on
the
books?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
last
20
years,
they
have
been
doing
this
not
only
with
the
coal
but
timber
and
many
other
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
an
impact
statement,
because
the
word
was
not
invented
but
making
that
kind
of
study
and
keeping
there
study
is
going
crap?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
take
a
full
series
of
relatively
minor
actions
of
the
federal
government
accumulated
them
and
taking
them
all
together
this
amounts
to
major
federal
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
almost
they
would
say
almost
exactly
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
language,
that
i
was
trying
to
paraphrase,
the
judge
wright
says,
the
question
is
whether
the
cumulative
effect
of
various
federal
actions,
all
individually
minor
could
together
constitute
major
federal
actions.
he
is
acknowledging
that
these
were
each
minor--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
terris.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
mr.
shea,
that
even
having
completed
which
they
have
not
done
apparently,
even
having
completed
the
study
of
the
whole
area
and
concluded
that
the
development
of
the
coal
resources
was
in
the
public
interest.
we
should
proceed
that
they
might
then
with
respect
to
particular
mines
on
particular
areas.
say
that
that
was
an
interference
with
the
environment
which
was
not
tolerable
and
that
particular
project
would
not
go
forward
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
necessarily
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
possible
but
not
necessarily
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
it
is
possible
that
some
of
them
near
to
each
other?

justice

you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
