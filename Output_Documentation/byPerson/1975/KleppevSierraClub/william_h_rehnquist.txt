justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
government
concede
that
it
was
required
by
the
act
to
file
a
national
impact
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well.
if
it
is
simply
a
report,
what
was
the
proposal
or
major
federal
action
which
required
it
under
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
geographically,
programmatically
and
what
is
the
third?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
map
an
evidence
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
fact
you
could
go
a
long
way
before
you
find
nine
people
at
no
less
about
the
fort
union
rock
formation
the
ones
you
are
arguing
to.
we
cannot
resolve
this
as
a
question
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
secretary
simply
decides
to
make
a
study
of
a
say
a
region
of
four
or
five
western
states
without
recommending
or
proposing
any
legislation
or
any
major
federal
action?
does
that
have
to
be
accompanied
in
your
view
by
an
impact
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
should
lose
this
litigation,
do
you
think
you
would
have
a
future
opportunity
to
attack
this
sufficiency
of
that
statement
or
is
that
involved
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
legislation
for
major
federal
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
keyword
mr.
terris,
at
least
literally
and
i
go
back
to
justice
brennan's
question
here,
to
your
associates.
it
is
a
recommendation
or
report
on
a
proposal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
must
be
accompanied
by
an
impact
statements.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
this
in
the
referral,
what
number
is
it,
i
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
finding
14.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
itself,
they
require
you
to
look
beyond
the
particular
project
as
what
the
justice
stevens
question
this
morning
indicate
but
that
can
be
done
in
an
individual
projects
statement
it
may
have
to
talk
about
other
things
than
just
the
immediate
consequences
of
that
project.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
challenge
that
if
you
disagree
with
it
when
they
file
an
impact
statement
that
everybody
concedes
is
required
for
a
specific
project
and
you
can
say
it
is
not
broad
enough?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
he
make
that
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
where
in
the
briefs
but
what
was
the
forum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
government
is
right
that
the
secretary
has
done
this
out
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart
and
the
law
does
not
require
him
to
do
it,
then
you
are
not
entitled
to
any
judicial
relief
in
a
way
of
an
injunction
in
the
system
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
was
wrong
in
issuing
the
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
that
the
injunction
issued
by
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
dissolved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
what
you
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
say
that
is
not
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
the
department
of
justice
represents
the
united
states
in
all
litigation
before
this
court?
