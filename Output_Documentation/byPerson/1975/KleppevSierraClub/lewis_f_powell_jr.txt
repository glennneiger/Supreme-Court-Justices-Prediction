justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
and
the
companion
case
presenting
the
same
issue
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
national
environmental
policy
act
of
1969
requires
environmental
impact
statements
on
the
various
circumstances.
federal
agencies,
whenever
they
make
a
recommendation
or
proposal
upon
major
federal
action
that
will
significantly
affect
the
environment,
are
required
to
file
an
impact
system.
the
sierra
club
and
other
organizations
brought
this
suit
to
force
the
secretary
of
interior
and
other
federal
officials
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
on
an
entire
area
in
the
northern
great
plains.
this
was
said
to
be
necessary
before
committing
private
companies
to
mine
any
of
the
vast
coal
reserves
controlled
by
the
federal
government
in
that
area.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
federal
officials,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
also
enjoined
the
secretariat
approval
of
several
mining
plans
in
one
portion
of
the
northern
great
plains
area.
we
stayed
that
injunction
when
we
granted
these
petitions.
we
now
vacate
the
injunction,
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
there
exists
no
proposal
for
a
major
federal
action
with
respect
to
the
northern
great
plains
area
as
a
whole.
in
absence
of
such
a
proposal,
the
act
by
it's
plain
language
does
not
require
an
environmental
impact
statement
on
an
entire
region.
but
federal
officials
may
continue
to
prepare
statements
on
individual
leases
or
on
groups
of
proposals
that
may
have
accumulative
environmental
effect
upon
geographically
defined
areas.
mr.
justice
marshall
with
whom
mr.
justice
brennan
joined,
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
